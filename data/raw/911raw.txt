goldi

travelling' s scary these days .
met a shrink on the train once .
told me i had the oedipus complex .
like , i' d been wanting to do it with ma .
so i showed him the picture of my ma .
he split .
just like pop did .
as soon as he took a good look at ma and rode it clean into a lamppost on his bike .
just like that .
boom .
that' s where i get my looks from .
pop .
well , i am taller .
pop was ...
... well , he wasn' t shaq o' neill exactly , if you know what i mean .

let me guess ... ... " winnie the pooh " ?
forensic medicine
do you know what causes body decay ?
bacteria .
they decompose complex proteins into simple ones ...
and when it' s as hot as in here , a body starts rotting really fast ...
you' re boring the gentleman , bubbles .
on the contrary .
it' s most interesting .
may i ... ?
some typical symptoms of decay are ... accumulation of putrid gases ... " ... " which cause the swelling of the abdomen ...
... the lips turn greenish black ...
... " tongue , protruding due to inward pressure " .
i' m feeling sick .
chief inspector haberek , homicide .

warsaw
the trzeci brothers " auto body shop .
at me !
you' re supposed to be looking at me , you halfwit .
they are supposed to look like me !
but you two look exactly the same ...
no two people are exactly the same .
everyone is special .
if 10 per cent out of 80 million germans are homeowners , how many gardens that anxiously await our dwarves does that make ?
well ... 8 million .
my point exactly !
8 million dwarves !
even michaelangelo never had an opportunity like this .
you better appreciate it !
will you stop smoking ?
i don' t want to get lung cancer .
oh , chill it .
we' ve two separate sets of lungs , thank god .
here you are !
at last .
everything ok ?
i' m afraid not exactly , boss .
you , michaelangelo !
go powder your nose , will you ?
excuse me ?
get the fuck out of here !
well , we got inside the church .
through a window .
the flashlight gave out on us , so we had to make do with a lighter .
i got burn blisters all over my fingers .
to the point , you idiot !
the point is , it was dark .
so i say to dizel ,
braille style stealing won' t cut it .
but we' il find some loot by the altar " .
and sure enough we did .
we' ve found these .
they are used in holy mass , you retards .
take it easy .
you make my blood pressure go up .
so where' s the madonna ?
you couldn' t even start a decent fire with it !
termites haven' t been feasting on that madonna for 600 years for nothing !
it' s the 600 years that make it so bloody precious !
i was going to stuff the madonna in a dwarf and ship it to germany !
what the hell am i gonna do with these damn chalices ?
donate them to a bavarian tavern in munich ? !
you left the church , and then what ?
we got to the car , but the tires were gone .
say what ... ?
the tires .
somebody stole our tires .
they stole their tires ... right ...
goldi , you' re a thief , aren' t you ?
thieves are the screw ers , not the screw ees !
they screw others , and not get screwed !
get it ? !
zyggie ... !
thls is the gutter of life , not a fucking oprah book club meeting .
i told dizel to wait for the tire service to open .
and meanwhile i put the loot in the suitcase ... ... and brought it here by train .
brilliant !
needless to say , this specimen over there is my favourite .
we' re lucky he hasn' t started rotting yet .
considerate of him .
shows good manners .
come to visit and then go to rot ?
embarrassing .
perhaps he isn' t dead ?
and what' s this ?
a manicure set ?
go get some tools .
and now a news breaking story .
a naked body of an unidentified midd/ e aged man has been found in cracow ...
a pipeline ...
weird ...
i don' t get it .
marian tuleja ...
central bureau of investigation ...
colonel ...
colonel ?
colonel !
boss , these new tires are way cool !
great grip on ...
zyggie , i' ve had it up to here with you .
i run a legitimate car business , pay my taxes , send checks to children' s charities .
i don' t want to do time in jail because i happen to be joined at the hip to a brother who smuggles stolen masterpieces in garden dwarves and transports cbi agents ' bodies via national rail !
i' ve told you a thousand times they can' t put you in jail , because you' re the good guy .
they can' t put me away either , because they would have to put you away as well .
henry , i' m the only criminal in the world they' re never gonna get .
are you done ?
all we have to do now is make mr. cbi and his funny papers disappear ...
well , here ?
well , did you want to take him to the zoo , or something ?
it was to be a deserted spot !
it' s cool !
it' s close to a horse riding school .
ok , goldi , say goodbye to your friend .
freeze !
it' s the police !
hands up !
turn around slowly !
keep your hands up !
what are you doing here ?
nothing .
gays ?
no way !
there' s nothing to be ashamed of .
it' s all human nature .
you boys be careful in the future .
don' t leave a handicapped friend all alone like that .
the world is full of perverts .
quiet .
there' s nobody around .
cool .
i' ve got a better idea .
trust me .
waza is gonna do us in if we don' t get rid of him .
what is it now ?
you' re going for a shave .
what the fuck ... ?
we' ve a dead guy here and you want me to shave ?
look ...
don' t do much shaving these days , not anymore .
new regulations .
they say you could get alds .
but who' d get alds around here ?
it' s the disease of the artists .
it' s simple folk around here .
rather lichen , boils , eczema .
well , maybe a touch of syphilis here and there , if someone' s been really frisky .
sit still .
the phone' s ringing !
eugene' s barbershop , may i help you ?
i' m the producer of " tarzan in poland " motion picture .
we seem to be having a problem with our gorilla .
it' s a she , to be precise .
she plays tarzan' s mother .
anyway , tarzan lands in the hospital after tasting our polish vodka he' s a jungle boy , not used to alcohol ...
i don' t get it ...
what do you want from me ?
i' m getting to it .
when mom gorilla finds out , she starts losing hair .
nerves .
she practically goes bald .
you know how mothers are .
so we' d like to bring her to you for a nice , clean shave .
hello !
we' il make it worth your while !
beasts , beasts , not humans .
they want me to shave a gorilla .
time to wake up , chief .
hey , mister , wake up , mister ... !
fall in !
at attention !
booze ok , but no drugs !
be back at a quarter past !
break it up !
at ease !
where do you think you' re going ?
you' re staying on duty !
i thought we' d end up eating him for lunch .
what are we gonna do about this shit ?
a buddy of mine works in a boiler room .
busy !
i need your help !
are you blind ?
i have a customer .
i' m begging you .
these are my first international manoeuvres .
everybody' s going to be there .
the americans , the british , the dutch ...
i have to look good .
will you give me a pedicure ?
this is a barbershop .
for men , you know !
and what do i look like to you ?
but please , be quick .
i must be back before the sarge realizes
i haven' t been guarding the truck .
where' s that truck ?
right outside .
all right .
take off your clothes and into the shower you go ...
do you want me to shower ?
can' t be too careful .
lichen , alds , gum disease .
all because of lack of proper hygiene .
thanks ...
that' s all right .
you' re back at last !
it' s all taken care of .
dizel' s just burning mr. cbl' s papers .
you' il set out as soon as he' s back !
an out of the way country church .
you are to take only the casket with the sculpture .
no chalices !
repeat !
just the casket !
no chalices !
jump !
what' s up with him ?
is he stoned ?
no way , sarge , sir !
just booze , like you ordered , sir !
a typical moonshine crash !
get him the fuck out !
he' il sober up flying !
julek and cezar
cracow .
julek , cezar and wolter' s place
what' s the birdie done to you ?
you , ornithologist !
bird saver !
they' re shitting all over the place .
who' s gonna clean up the crap ?
i' ve grown fur like a bear .
i need to shave .
say , did you know wolter had kids ?
three daughters in sopot .
it' s a damn shame .
i told him not to touch these bottles .
but would he listen ?
how come we have them here anyway ?
dynksiarz left them here .
he' s working at a cemetery now .
what does he need this shit for ?
he wants to poison the dead ?
it' s the new service .
people are making more dough now and they have greater demands .
it' s not enough to have your mother in law just dropped in the hole .
now people want their dead mummified .
what ?
embalming , that' s what .
they' ve hired this russian guy who' d supposedly embalmed lenin .
they' ve so much work you have to book the procedure 3 months in advance .
sneeze , and your family puts your name on the list right away .
but this is illegal !
that' s why he keeps his embalming potion here .
or had kept , until wolter drank it .
so , now what ?
is he gonna turn into a fucking mummy ?
who knows .
it' s definitely going to take some time before he starts rotting .
i need some air .
piotr west here .
marian tuleja .
i' m in cracow .
great .
i can' t wait to meet you . / sti // can hard/ y be/ ieve it .
you haven' t told anyone , have you ?
your wife ?
not a word .
cross my heart .
we' il surprise her .
i' il see you in an hour ?
right .
haven' t forgotten the password ?
whatever gave you the idea ?
you have no idea ...
well ...
in a week or so wolter would have been world famous .
why ?
his real name was bill gates , but he was really shy about it ?
you really are a mega moron !
he knew who fathered roo .
fathered who ?
roo .
when kanga appears in the forest , she already has baby roo with her .
but she never mentions his father .
still , one can infer that some of the animals may have had something to do with it .
what animals ?
are you nuts ?
it' s " winnie the pooh " , dickhead !
wolter came to the conclusion that ...
whoa , whoa !
hold it !
you' re fucking with me , right ?
why ?
i find it hard to believe , that for over a year i' ve been sharing the apartment with a guy who wants to know who fucked a kangaroo !
fucked a kangaroo .
that' s all you are able to relate to , you perv .
hey !
wait up !
oh , get fucked !
what hour' s this ?
i' ve forgotten my watch .
last winter apple trees suddenly blossomed ...
due to the ozone layer damage ?
we' d love to chat , but time does fly .
he hasn' t sent you ?
who hasn' t sent us ?
never mind .
the world' s full of freaks .
let' s go !
so who was the father of this what' s his name roo ?
i don' t know .
wolter didn' t manage to tell me .
excuse me , where will i find jello ?
on the other side .
thanks .
you' re welcome .
would you be so kind ...
i' d like this box of jelly candies ...
no , not this one ... that one !
but they are all exactly the same !
if you don' t mind ...
i do need that box .
there .
thank you .
the shopping' s already packed , and i had to forget the brandy ... !
an old woman' s weakness ...
save the excuses .
half the population drinks .
the jellies are for my granddaughter .
we' re leaving for the seaside soon .
what a coincidence .
we' re going to the seaside , too .
you are ?
we are ?
a friend has to visit his family .
excuse me ...
what family ?
have you seen wolter' s id ?
three kids in sopot ...
wolter' s lying stiff on the sofa .
oleka !
he doesn' t look like someone who' s missing his children !
oleka !
watch it , shitpants !
look , it' s that freak ...
it' s not him .
different suit .
that' s no proof !
freaks are freaky .
i' m sorry .
stick it up your ass !
if you insist on being vulgar , granny shall punish you .
severely .
please don' t mind him .
he' s a loony .
completely loco .
why drag him there ?
we could bury him here , courtesy of dynksiarz .
wolter' s got family !
had !
he' s dead , if you hadn' t noticed !
and how are you planning
to get the body across the country ?
i' il think of something .
to the family reunion !
we' re broke .
i' m tired .
i' il just have my two vodka doubles , crash
next to wolter and sleep like the dead .
like the dead with the poisoned .
shut up !
it' s the freak from the market !
a selfish freak , at that .
check out his wallet !
i' m an organist , not a thief !
we need the money for the trip !
oh , all right .
wait , i' ve got a better idea .
his suit .
for wolter' s final journey .
i didn' t think we were going to make it .
well , wolter , they will be really surprised to see you wearing a suit !
i wonder what' s in the briefcase .
what ?
perhaps we should take a peep ?
later .
can you see that woman over there ?
see that guy ?
just wait and observe .
my bag !
catch the thief !
and the bag is fucking gone .
the world' s a jungle , alas .
are we supposed to accept that ?
what are we gonna do now , you idiot !
oh , we' il get him back !
but how ?
let me just park my butt here , ok ?
there' s some thugs sitting in my car .
travelling' s scary these days .
i think i' ve got it .
it' s rabbit .
he' s the father .
yeah , and you' re the grandpa .
i' m telling you .
it was rabbit that' d made the little bugger .
look , as soon as kanga arrives in the forest , rabbit starts his ugly scheming .
he talks piglet and pooh into kidnapping baby roo .
and why ?
we' il tell you where baby roo is , if you promise to go away from the forest and never come back
so ?
what do you mean " so " ?
use your cabeza , dude .
he knocked her up , and now she' s come back with the kid , so he' s scared shitless that she wants to claim child support .
that' s why he kidnaps baby roo .
the sob .
rabbit ?
lmpossible .
i' d sooner put my money on pooh .
pooh ?
pooh' s too childish .
all he does is guzzle honey and sing stupid songs .
give it to me !
and every tuesday roo spent the day with his friend rabbit , and every ...
... tuesday kanga spent the day with her friend pooh , teaching him to jump " .
gentlemen ...
get it ?
rabbit babysits the kid all day so mommy can do some hopping around with pooh !
rich , don' t you think ?
bed hopping' s more like it .
a sexual " little something " .
and how do you know they weren' t doing it before roo was born ?
but how ?
she wasn' t even living there ...
man , sometimes i think you were born yesterday .
gentlemen ...
i need to pee .
owl ?
no way .
maybe eeyore ?
such an unassuming , quiet little jackass .
i just know the kind .
they' re the worst scum .
we don' t have time for this !
chill .
there' s always time for thls .
we' re just returning from an expedition ,
tigers , ticks , snakes , you know .
stuff .
what kind of music do you like , miss ... ?
morrison ... just morrison .
so we' re kindred spirits .
i could tell right away .
great music , that .
i' m gonna love you and treat you right " .
marley .
my number one .
are we there yet ?
my car is somewhere around here .
what rotten luck .
it broke down on us right in the middle of the woods .
us ?
what do you mean " us " ?
well , us .
who are you with ?
a fiance ?
no , a sister .
sisters .
all alone in the woods .
little red riding hoods .
and where' s your precious sister ?
she' il turn up .
and inspector gadget here is gonna take care of the car , right ?
me ?
well , who else ?
me ?
could you give me the keys ?
a kiss ... ?
i mean , car keys .
ah ... they' re in the car .
jesus christ !
what' s this ?
a coffin .
i can see that .
but what' s inside ?
what do you think ?
potatoes ?
i used to be an organist , you know .
i was kind of partial to drink , so the vicar put a curse on me .
he said that if i kept on drinking ,
i' d go straight to hell .
you didn' t believe him , did you ?
i did .
i haven' t touched liquor since .
i add jello to my vodka , wait until it sets , and eat it .
mind you , eat it .
not drink it .
do you think your boss , is gonna hold it against me ?
if my boss appreciates brains , you have his absolution already .
what' s with the skis ?
they aren' t ours .
they' re hers .
every year she participated in the monastic winter games .
sister benedicta won the silver medal in ski jumping two days ago .
she was in top form .
and that very night she slipped and fell in the shower ...
unknown to man are the ways of god .
fame today , funeral tomorrow .
not tomorrow , but today .
and we have to make it .
nuns from all over poland are coming to pay her the last respects .
it stopped raining .
nice girls , huh ?
do you think wolter is up there ... somewhere ?
sandra and tuleja
the pomeranlan lake dlstrlct .
the wests " summer cabln .
you' ve taken viagra , haven' t you ?
we' ve been married for 5 years and you' ve never been this horny .
is that bad ?
no .
i' m gonna take a shower ...
how many times have i told you to do something about the damn brooms !
do think it over , dear .
a marita / crisis is not the reason to ki // .
cracow one week earller .
what does your conscience say ?
don' t you worry about my conscience .
i' ve made up my mind .
as you wish .
leave the picture and the advance money in the je // y candy box .
the one / ' ve to/ d you about .
you ' // pay the rest as a widow .
come on , darling ...
we haven' t done it for a week ... or so ?
well , it' s been slightly longer than that .
see ?
come on , then .
you' d better get yourself to bed , vicar .
computers are mighty bad for the eyes .
when so many tormented souls need consolation ...
but it' s night time already .
it is here , but not in america .
don' t they have priests in america ?
the whole village is talking , vicar .
that vicar only does confession through this box here , and has forsaken the sheep in his own parish .
thanks to the net the whole world is my parish now .
i cannot concern myself solely with one village , when the global village is in need .
it' s nothing .
probably the wind .
get out and check it out !
right now ? !
well , get up and see !
out , out you go !
we were smuggling the dwarves to amsterdam once .
a sunday caught us there .
i was bored out of my mind , man .
my mug was stiff from smoking all that pot .
so i think , why not pop into a museum ...
i' ve been to a museum once .
it was on a school trip .
a military museum or something .
we had to wear these felt slippers .
i skidded into a cannon .
head on .
got 5 stitches .
fuck the museums , man .
but it wasn' t a regular museum .
it was a sex museum !
a sex museum ?
i know a broad by that name .
lives in my building .
why do you always have to interrupt me ?
stop staring like an idiot !
move your ass !
we' re in deep shit !
shit !
he' s wearing a uniform !
is he dead ?
no , he' s just taking a nap .
of course he' s dead !
i shot at him twice .
what are we gonna do with him ?
we' il adopt him ?
it' s all your fault !
you couldn' t just stay in bed , could you ?
we must get rid of him .
how ?
we' il roast him for dinner ?
he' s a soldier .
an army of investigators will be all over us before we know it !
wait a minute !
what' s this ?
your jogging tracksuit .
do you want me to go jogging now ?
are you nuts ?
the lake .
about 15 km from here ?
we' il drop him in there .
nobody' s gonna make the connection between a jogger and a missing marine .
we have to get him down .
saint anthony ready to go ?
he' s in the box .
i' m gonna miss him .
so many years together .
he' s just going for renovation .
he' il be back as good as new .
still , it makes me sad to see him go .
we' ve grown used to each other .
i think i' il go in again to say good bye .
don' t forget to lock the door !
as if ...
don' t you " as if " me .
i know you too well .
he had no bullet marks , which means you didn' t get him .
like it matters now !
how did he die then ?
out of fear ?
he' s dead , and that' s the end of it .
what' s this piece of junk ?
why doesn' t it start ?
time for a swim !
fuck !
we' il never get anywhere on this piece of crap !
the church !
what now ?
push , go on , push it !
shit , his legs got all cramped from sitting in that bike .
i can' t unbend them .
rest him against the confessional .
it will look more natural .
who' s here ?
i' d like to confess my sins , father .
but i can' t ...
i' m ... ... you' re my last hope .
but i ...
hear me out , or i' il be doomed forever .
i' m a terrible sinner .
i like animals .
so did st. francis .
nothing wrong with that .
but i ... like them ... too much .
don' t stop them , grandma .
they' re going the other way .
goldi , don' t get upset .
so what did you see at the museum ?
a guy with the biggest little pecker in the world !
was he working there ?
no , he was in this picture .
black and white or colour ?
what the fuck does it matter ?
i' m telling you the guy' s wiener was the size of empire state building , and you are testing my knowledge of photographic techniques ?
wanna know whether the finish was glossy or matte ?
come on !
if it was the size of the empire state building , it couldn' t have been a " little pecker " .
it' s an expression : " to have a little ...
but if ...
fine !
he had a gargantuan george !
are you happy now ?
and when did you become a linguist ?
see , you' ve made me miss the exit !
... then there was the squirrel .
but i didn' t love him .
it was pure lust .
the bible says you sin if you cast but one lustful look at a woman .
squirrels ...
pray to the merciful lord , son ; you may be forgiven ...
no , you should burn in hell !
get out !
out !
didn' t you hear me ?
out !
now !
oh sweet mother of jesus !
see , i knew i was right to wait !
well .
where' s the corpse ?
he was in the casket just a minute ago .
he must have risen from the dead .
in twenty minutes ' time ?
even christ himself took 3 days to do it .
and where' s the casket ?
up and risen from the dead too ?
i smell something fishy here !
whatever is vicar implying ?
i am in aa now ...
darling ...
wait ...
open your mouth ...
don' t move , or i' il shoot you !
now , who the hell are you ?
i am your husband !
what are you doing , darling ?
i am killing you , darling .
i' ve wanted to do it for a long time .
please !
don' t !
i' m not your husband !
no kidding !
of course you aren' t !
do you think i' m an utter idiot !
who are you ?
the truth !
i' m his brother !
you' re lying !
piotr never had a brother !
he did .
he just didn' t know about me .
our mother abandoned us .
he was adopted ... and i grew up in the orphanage .
so you killed him out of envy ?
for his luck and success ?
no !
that' s not it !
then why ?
why ?
this deal is beginning to stink big time .
i want out .
konstancln near warsaw , 14 days earller
too late .
you can' t pull out now .
it' s not the paris dakar race .
this pipeline is a risky business .
journalists are sniffing around .
even the cbi has started an investigation .
someone is bound to put two and two together .
i' il be fucked .
what are you , a rookie ?
don' t you know what to do ?
co op with them , destroy evidence , mess up their leads and clues .
senator , i' m just a simple cbi agent .
i' ve no ambition to become 007 .
it' s getting too hot for my comfort .
adieu .
watch it , or i' il bid " adieu " to you .
for good .
cracow one day earller .
they say you' ve disappeared from warsaw .
are you avoiding me ?
did you have to kill a journalist of biggest paper in the country ?
you refused to help me , so i had to help myself .
the deal is off .
i want out , and i don' t mean maybe .
oh , you don' t ?
so what are you going to do ?
squeal on me to the police ?
or take thee to a nunnery ?
i' il get you wherever you go .
you' d have dissolve into thin air .
perhaps i will .
that' s enough .
i' il kill you if you don' t cooperate .
/ s that c/ ear ?
you' re with me or your dead .
piotr west here .
marian tuleja .
i am in cracow .
how did you guess i wasn' t him ?
we were identical .
not quite .
piotr was impotent .
oh , shit .
that would have never occured to me .
was that the only reason why you wanted to kill him ?
isn' t that enough ?
i even hired a hitman .
the skydiver ?
some hitman .
he wasn' t that bad .
that greedy old man on the train saved your life .
the one at the buffet ?
the sucker who ate my hot dogs ?
god , life is beautiful , after all .
i so wanted to get rid of piotr and now , thanks to you , he' s gone .
the senator will never find you .
you' re piotr west now .
i' il confirm it anytime .
wait here .
i' il take a shower , and we' il renegotiate our deal .
many times over ... darling .
the man , whose naked body was found in cracow / ast night ... has been identified as piotr west , a we // known businessman .
the po/ ice are / ooking for his wife ...
mrs. sandra west , who has mysterious/ y disappeared ...
shit , zyggie !
all set .
we still have some putty left .
what am i to do with them , henry ?
fire them ...
and hire that one over there .
he is nicely tranquil .
i know of some deep caves .
we could drop him in there .
oh , we' il fix it .
we still have some putty .
i think we should back out of this assignment .
why ?
one the subject of elimination missing from the cabin .
two our employer found dead in the shower on the premises .
so ?
don' t rub so hard , or you' il leave scratch marks .
and we' re not going to get the rest of the money !
do you know why people appreciate swiss watches the most ?
for their consistent quality .
it' s the reputation .
the brand name .
that' s why i' d prefer to lose half of my pay than a client' s trust .
even if he' s dead .
we' il find the hubby of the late , mrs. west and we' il finish the job .
but we' re not going to use poisoned hot dogs again , are we ?
no , we aren' t , bubbles .
we' il do it the classic way .
breathe in , breathe out .
in out .
that body double trick was smart .
who was that guy anyway ?
my brother .
you killed your own brother ?
you' re cbi scum through and through .
it' s a shame your brilliant plan fell through .
the police didn' t identify him as tuleja ;
there was no cbi id , no badge .
no papers .
you should try it .
no , thanks .
it' s not a recommendation .
it' s an order .
my own documents were not to be found on him , either ... and they shouldn' t be roaming the country .
i' il get them for you , senator .
just give me one more chance .
i' ve heard that some punk wanted to sell my papers to the press .
find him before they do .
yes sir !
good morning .
good morning .
miss , we' re looking for a friend .
freeze !
police !
what' s going on ?
a bit too early for the bubbly .
now you must get rid of her .
dizel and goldi will be here any minute .
your faith in them is truly inspiring .
they just had to bring a coffin .
they can do that much , i hope .
it must be them now .
freeze .
the police !
that' s it .
insalata mista !
how did they find out about the nun ?
they' re not here about her .
about what then ?
the dwarves ?
jesus , you were supposed to burn it !
well , i thought i was gonna make some dough on the side .
i' m dead meat already .
take it and get inside !
are you crazy ?
i' m not dead yet !
you will be if you don' t get in .
go on !
so you know nothing about my briefcase .
think hard .
i' il make you an honest offer .
how honest ?
i' il honestly kill you .
painlessly .
you' re kidding ?
it wasn' t me !
it was goldi !
are you crazy ?
who ?
goldi !
he works here .
he' s the one with the briefcase !
where is it now ?
what ?
goldi ?
goldi put it in the coffin , which the nuns drove away with .
i swear !
the briefcase !
don' t play stupid with me !
i' m not !
it went to szamocin .
that' s where the nunnery is .
they are going to bury it tonight .
there' s this funeral .
shit !
what' s that place called again ?
szamocin .
please , don' t hurt me !
death does it hurt at all ?
i' ve located the briefcase .
i' m going there right now .
there' s this goldi guy ...
what do we do about him ?
yes , of course .
the documents .
they are the most important .
men are like pasta .
you turn up the heat , they go soft .
and so will you .
you poisoned the guy with hot dogs , si ?
he poisoned himself .
with this balm .
are you bullshitting me ?
no way .
honest .
it was the body balm .
embalming balm , to be precise .
for the dead .
perhaps there is a method in your madness ... because your situation doesn' t look good .
let' s see .
what have we here ?
the dead guy on the train .
poisoned with hot dogs .
what' s next ... ?
secundo ...
two guys asking about the dead guy in question ;
the two guys carry tickets for the transfer in question .
25 years of doing time it' s gonna drag on like imitation mozarella .
inspector , the papers you wanted weren' t at the body shop .
but we' ve found another body .
of a woman ... sort of ...
leave philosophy to the superiors .
you just tell it like it is .
it' s a nun , sir !
most interesting .
a case in the spiritual spheres , at last , carbonaras .
what about the perpetrators ?
got them , sir !
two of them , sir !
or one .
it depends on how you look at it .
don' t give me a farfalle here !
so how many are there ?
well , two .
they are siamese twins .
joined at the hip .
must be all those damn chemicals .
are they talking yet ?
they' re doing this loony act .
they' re saying they got the nun by mistake .
by mistake .
yeah , right .
they say they' ve exchanged her for the body sb' s found on the train .
who wouldn' t like to find a body on the train ?
but in order to accomplish this you' d have to be me .
where' s the nun ?
in the van , outside .
and the siamese ?
they' re being questioned .
you two stay here , gorgonzola !
i' m not done with you yet .
you' re the dude with the dead nun ?
so what if i am ?
you' re fucked , that' s what .
you were to report an hour ago .
haberek' s gone totally bananas .
pappardelle ! " , he was yelling , i' il wring off his pappardelle !
get out of here !
we' il keep an eye on the nun .
oh , how beautiful !
szamocln the gabrlellte slsters order
i can sense dear benedicta' s spirit watching from above and rejoicing !
and where is sister morrison ?
you two' d better not be late again .
she' s in her cell praying .
the naked man who vanda/ ized the barbershop / ast night has been identified as a marine , whose division took part in internationa / nato maneouvres recent/ y conc/ uded in po/ and .
according to the nato spokesman , the incident didn' t affect the success of the operation ...
are you crazy !
men are not allowed in here !
that' s why we' re hanging outside !
cezar !
i can' t hold on any longer !
what are you doing here ?
you are not going to believe it .
even a nun' s faith has some limits .
i' ve got a cramp !
shut up !
you have to let us inside !
absolutely not !
the wake starts in an hour !
do you have any idea what' s going to be happening here ?
we do , actually .
just wait till they open the coffin !
i knew i should have shaved !
oh , stop it .
you better think of what to say to mother superior !
oh , shi ... she' s from the curia !
these sisters are from the curia !
the curia !
what is ailing you , sister ?
we make a splendid cordial here , works wonders for toothaches .
i used to be a missionary in baghdad .
it' s just ... habit , you see .
a man has penetrated inside our house !
it has never happened before !
i' m not a man .
i' m a cbi officer .
you are in serious danger , and so is our country .
what' s the matter ?
this is strictly confidential information .
but where is this danger located ?
where did you get this ?
charity .
do you think it will be big enough for him ?
god willing ...
did you miss me ?
because i did ...
jesus ...
quick !
there' s no time to lose !
or you will be burying me in a moment !
wolter ...
please forgive me .
hey , why is he wearing a tracksuit ?
he' s been jogging ?
with a briefcase ?
i hear footsteps !
hurry up !
they' re almost here !
it' s too late !
just push him under the catafalque !
the briefcase !
from this moment on everything you see is strictly confidential .
you know , like confession , of sorts .
we don' t do confession , colonel .
please take what' s yours and get out .
raise the cover , sister .
shit !
what do you think you' re doing ? !
get your paws away from her !
it must be here somewhere !
is this your confidential material , you pervert ?
i can explain !
no , let me explain something to you !
don' t just stand there !
do something !
fucking taliban !
oh , no !
thank you !
i' ve got the papers !
this goldi guy ?
no , not yet .
as you wish .
he' s dead meat anyway .
the guy pawing sister benedicta is the same freak who asked us the weird question about apple trees in blossom .
you were right , he' s nuts .
what' s wrong ?
i' m just tired .
it was crowded , and the nuns kept singing all night long .
wait this must be it .
let go of me !
i' m so very ... very sorry ...
i' m sorry times three .
a salesman ?
we don' t need anything !
madam , forgive me , but i must be blunt .
your husband is dead .
what' s up ?
the chicken soup' s getting cold .
i' ve no idea .
oh , i see .
life abhors vacuum , doesn' t it ?
a poet or something ?
give him some money and get back to the table .
he' s no poet .
he' s a nut .
he says you' re dead .
let me take care of that .
so i' m dead , eh ?
can you hear the song tonight , my sweet pame/ a ?
can you hear the distant cry of the guitars ?
oh , the boys from our pueb/ o , they are singing their / ast song before they / eave this mean o/ d town
hunger' s driving us away from empty pampa
where opuntias' prick/ y spikes pierce scorching skies .
we are / eaving for the city , sweet pame/ a to / ook for the dai/ y bread and lady luck ...
now what ?
poland' s run out on us !
it' s a fake .
i should have noticed it earlier .
do you remember when wolter was working at " exotica " night club ?
this guy here is a truck driver .
he' d lost his id in " exotica " .
i' d like an ice cream , please .
beat it , fatso !
go jogging instead !

seems kind of retarded storing a pal in a mobile ice cream box .
we have to bury him .
i know .
but where ?
on the beach ?
any other ideas ?
i have one !
warsaw
dearly beloved .
misery loves company .
two days ago we said goodbye to adas dizel .
today we bid our last farewell to our friend emil karpatka ,
aka goldi .
the ruthless hand of death reaped this young life far too soon .
what are you doing here , colonel ?
working up an appetite before dinner ?
don' t get smart with me .
if it were up to me , you would never have got out as long as you lived .
well , like you said .
it isn' t up to you .
do you know my brother ?
a very honest man .
he' s depressed .
did you know goldi ?
a wonderful boy .
i was like a father to him .
and i like an uncle .
a most terrible thing .
poisoned with some russian concoction .
let me introduce , my new employee wolter .
he' s replaced goldi , may he rlp .
where to , boss ?
to the clinic , you moron .
he pulled out a gun , and ...
watch it , shitpants !
i warned you .
granny is going to punish you .
no , no !
i' m telling you !
it' s tigger !
we were such retards not to have seen it right away !
tigger ?
he' s so immature !
all he ever does is bounce !
exactly !
so he could have bounced kanga .
he' s her roommate after all .
only because she gives him cod liver oil .
maybe it' s christopher robin .
somehow i never liked the sob .
would you give me a shave ?
i would appreciate it if you left these premises immediately .
excuse me ?
get the fuck out of here !
fuck shaving .
i' m growing a beard .
