miles !
you going to work all day ?
i' m sorry , baby .
this thing is kicking my ass .
it' s sunday .
you promised to take the kids to raging waters today .
i can' t .
i' m on a roll .
this is gonna blow ' em away .
it' s a neural net processor .
i know .
you told me .
it thinks and learns like we do .
it' s superconducting at room temperature .
other computers are just pocket calculators by comparison .
why is that so important ?
i need to know , ' cause sometimes i feel like
i' m going crazy here .
baby , i am this close .
come here .
imagine a jet airliner with a pilot that never gets tired , never makes mistakes , never shows up with a hangover .
meet the pilot .
why did we get married ?
have children ?
you don' t need us .
your heart and your mind are in here .
but it doesn' t love you like we do .
i' m sorry .
really .
how about spending some time with your other babies ?
raging waters ?
yeah !
wait in the car .
enrique ?
you here ?
pretty jumpy , connor .
what about you ?
always on the lurk .
good to see you , connor .
i promised to make it back .
man , i knew it .
good to see you .
yolanda .
get out here , we got company .
and bring some tequila !
oye , big john ?
que pasa ?
what' s up ?
who' s your friend ?
he' s cool .
he' s with me .
he is uncle bob .
uncle bob , this is enrique .
uncle bob , huh ?
okay .
how are you ?
how are you ?
you' ve gotten big .
drink ?
uncle bob ?
sarahlita , you pretty famous .
all over the tv .
pictures of you , john , your big friend here .
cops are going nuts looking for you .
take the kid , honey , will you ?
i just came for my stuff .
i need clothes , food , and one of your trucks .
how about the fillings out of my fucking teeth ?
now .
you two , you' re on weapons detail .
come on , let' s go .
one thing about my mom , she always plans ahead .
excellent .
nothing down here .
this is the best truck i got , but the starter is gone .
you got the time to change it out ?
yeah .
i' m gonna wait till dark to cross the border .
enrique , it' s dangerous for you here .
you get out tonight too , okay ?
sure .
just drop by any time and totally fuck up my life .
see , i grew up in places like this , so i thought that' s how people lived : riding around in helicopters ,
learning how to blow shit up .
but then , when my mom got busted , i got put in a regular school .
the other kids were into nintendo .
are you ever afraid ?
no .
not even of dying ?
no .
you don' t feel any emotion about it one way or another ?
no .
i have to stay functional until the mission is complete .
then it doesn' t matter .
yeah .
i have to stay functional too .
i' m " too important " .
that' s definitely you .
most of the guys my mom hung round with were geeks .
but there was this one guy .
he was kinda cool .
he taught me engines .
hold here .
mom screwed it up , of course .
she' d always tell them about judgment day and me being this world leader .
and that' il be all she wrote .
torque wrench , please .
here .
i wish i could' ve met my real dad .
you will .
yeah .
i guess .
when i' m , like , 45 , i think .
i' il send him back through time to 1984 .
he hasn' t even been born yet .
it messes with your head .
the other bolt .
here .
mom and him were only together one night .
she still loves him , i guess .
i see her crying sometimes .
she denies it totally , of course .
like she got something stuck in her eye .
why do you cry ?
you mean people ?
yeah .
i don' t know .
we just cry , you know .
when it hurts .
pain causes it ?
no , it' s different .
it' s when there' s nothing wrong but you hurt anyway .
you get it ?
no .
alright !
my man !
no problemo .
gimme five .
put out your hand like this .
come on .
alright .
now hit me .
gimme five .
do the same thing .
alright !
okay , that' s good .
up high , up high .
five low .
too slow .
just kidding .
one more time .
watching john with the machine , it was suddenly so clear .
the terminator would never stop , it would never leave him , never hurt him , never shout at him or get drunk and hit him , or say it was too busy to spend time with him .
it would always be there .
and it would die to protect him .
of all the would be fathers who came and went , this thing , this machine , was the only one who measured up .
in an insane world , it was the sanest choice .
she said you go south with him .
she' il meet you tomorrow .
mom !
mom !
wait !
no fate .
no fate but what we make .
my father told her this .
i mean , i made him memorize it , up in the future , as a message to her .
never mind .
the future is not set .
there is no fate but what we make for ourselves .
she intends to change the future .
yeah , i guess .
oh shit !
dyson .
yeah , gotta be !
miles dyson !
she' s gonna blow him away !
come on !
let' s go !
this is tactically dangerous .
drive faster .
the t 1000 has the same files that i do .
it knows what i know .
it might anticipate this move .
i don' t care .
we' ve gotta stop her .
killing dyson might actually prevent the war .
i don' t care !
haven' t you learnt anything yet ?
why you can' t kill people ?
look , maybe you don' t care if you live or die .
but everybody' s not like that !
we have feelings .
we hurt .
we' re afraid .
you gotta learn this stuff .
i' m not kidding .
it' s important .
danny , i told you to go to bed like your sister .
just a couple of minutes , mom .
danny , your time is up .
come brush your teeth and get to bed .
danny just go !
oh my god !
just take danny and go .
run !
oh jesus , miles .
nobody fucking move !
don' t hurt my daddy !
get on the floor !
fucking down !
now !
get out of the way !
don' t hurt him !
get on the floor !
fast !
just let the boy go .
shut up !
shut up !
it' s all your fault !
it' s all your fault !
what ?
i' m not gonna let you do it .
shit , we' re too late .
check them .
look at me , mom .
are you hurt ?
look at me .
i almost ...
i almost ...
it' il by okay .
we' il figure something out , okay ?
promise .
you came here to stop me ?
yes , i did .
i love you , john .
i always have .
i know .
clean penetration .
no shattered bone .
hold here .
compression should stop the bleeding .
who are you ?
show him .
danny , i want you to come with me .
show me your room .
oh , my god !
now listen to me very carefully .
dyson listened while the terminator laid it all down .
skynet , judgment day , the history of things to come .
it' s not every day that you find out you' re responsible for 3 billion deaths .
he took it pretty well .
i feel like i' m gonna throw up .
you' re judging me on things i haven' t even done yet .
how were we supposed to know ?
yeah .
right .
how were you supposed to know ?
fucking men like you built the hydrogen bomb .
men like you thought it up .
you think you' re so creative .
you don' t know what it' s like to create something .
to create a life .
to feel it growing inside you .
all you know how to create is death and destruction .
mom !
we need to be a little more constructive here , okay ?
we still have to stop this from happening .
but i thought ...
aren' t we changing things ?
changing the way it goes ?
that' s right !
there' s no way i' m gonna finish the processor .
not now .
forget it .
i' m out of it .
i quit cyberdyne tomorrow .
not good enough .
no one must follow your work .
right , then ...
we have to destroy the stuff at the lab .
the files , drives ...
everything .
everything here .
everything !
i don' t care .
do you know about the chip ?
what chip ?
in a vault at cyberdyne .
from the other one like you .
the cpu from the first terminator .
son of a bitch , i knew it !
they told us not to ask where they got it .
those lying motherfuckers !
it was radically advanced .
it was smashed , it didn' t work .
but it gave us ideas , took us in new directions .
things we' d never ...
all my work is based on it .
it must be destroyed .
can you get us in , past security ?
i think so , yeah .
when ?
now ?
the future , always so clear to me , had become like a black highway at night .
we were in uncharted territory now , making up history as we went along .
hi .
carl , right ?
friends from outta town , thought i' d ... ... show them around .
you know the rules concerning visitors .
i need authorization ...
i insist .
don' t even think about it .
takes 2 keys to open the vault , turned simultaneously .
the other one is at the security station .
gibbons .
come on , man , you can' t leave the desk like that .
oh , shit .
my card should access this .
what is it ?
dammit .
the silent alarm' s been tripped .
it' s neutralized all the codes in the building .
nothing' il open anywhere now .
we have to abort .
no .
we do it all the way !
okay ?
you guys get started on the lab .
i can open this .
i think it' s that guy from the mall .
it is the guy !
him and the woman .
just send everything you' ve got in the area .
i have a personal entry code for the lab that may still work .
it' s no good .
let me try mine .
john !
fire in the hole !
wait !
you can' t go in there !
the fire' s set off the halo system !
you have to wait a few minutes , until the gas clears .
put this on .
alright , let' s get to work .
a 211 in progress at 2144 kramer street , the cyberdyne building .
suspect 1 is white , female , identified as : last name connor , first name sarah , escaped from pescadero state hospital .
suspect 2 : white , male ...
all the disks in my office .
all the disks in that office over there .
everything behind my desk .
all the processors on my left .
we' il blow it up with the cp4 .

i worked a lot of years on this thing .

i know now why you cry .
but it' s something i can never do .
goodbye .
the unknown future rolls toward us .
i face it for the first time with a sense of hope .
because if a machine , a terminator , can learn the value of human life , maybe we can too .
