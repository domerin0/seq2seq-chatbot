bad news coming .
can you provide us with a guide to take us to delhi ?
i' m a professor .
i have to get back to my university .
yes .
sajnu will guide you .
on the way to delhi , you will stop at pankot .
pankot is not on the way to delhi .
you will go to pankot palace .
i thought the palace had been deserted since , uh ... the 1850s .
no .
now there is a new maharaja , and again the palace has the power of the dark light .
it is that place kill my people .
what has happened here ?
the evil start in pankot ... then like monsoon ... it moves darkness ... over all country ... over all country .
the evil ?
what evil ?
see ?
bad news .
you listen to suwamu .
you leave lanka .
shh ...
they came from palace ... and took sivalinga ... from our village .
took what ?
it' s a stone ... a sacred stone from the shrine that protects the village .
it is why siva brought you here .
we weren' t brought here .
our plane crashed .
it crashed .
no , no .
we prayed to siva to help us find the stone .
it was siva who made you fall from the sky .
so you will go to pankot palace to find sivilinga and bring back to us .
bring back to us .
bring back to us .
bring back to us .
dr. jones , did they make the plane crash to get you here ?
no , shorty , it' s just a ghost story .
don' t worry about it .
they took the stone from here .
was the stone very smooth like a rock from a sacred river ?
yes .
with three lines across it representing the three levels of the universe .
that' s right .
yes .
i' ve seen stones like the one you lost .
but why would maharaja take the sacred stone from here ?
they says we must pray to their evil god .
we says we will not .
excuse me ,
i don' t understand how one rock could destroy a whole village .
he' s saying when the sacred stone was taken , the village wells dried up , and the river turned to sand .
the crops were swallowed by the earth , and the animals laid down and turned to dust .
then one night there was a fire in the fields .
the men went out to fight the fire .
when they came back , the women were crying in the darkness .
children .
he says they stole their children .
sankara !
sankara ...
ranjit !
ranjit !
sankara .
little boy escaped from the evil palace .
many other children still there .
what we do , dr. jones ?
what you think ?
i think that somebody believes the good luck rock from this village is one of the lost sankara stones .
what is sankara ?
fortune and glory , kid .
fortune and glory .

and to help him , he gave him five sacred stones with magical properties .

we walk from here .
hello .
i should say you look rather lost .
but then i cannot imagine where in the world the three of you would look at home .
we' re not lost .
we' re on our way to delhi .
this is miss scott .
this is mr. round .
short round .
my name is indiana jones .
dr. jones , the eminent archaeologist ?
hard to believe , isn' t it ?
ah .
i remember first hearing your name when i was up at oxford .
oh .
i' m chattar lal , prime minister to his highness , the maharaja of pankot .
i' m enchanted .
enchanted .
thank you very much .
thank you very much .
welcome to pankot palace !
enchanted , huh ?
shorty , where' s my razor ?
we are fortunate tonight to have so many unexpected visitors .
this is captain ... ... blumburtt .
11th poona rifles .
and you , sir , are dr. jones , i presume .
i am , captain .
captain blumburtt and his troops are on a routine inspection tour .
the british find it amusing to inspect us at their convenience .
i do hope , sir , that it' s not , uh , inconvenient to you , uh ... sir .
the british worry so about their empire .
makes us all feel like well cared for children .
ah ... you look beautiful .
i think the maharaja is swimming in loot .
maybe it wasn' t such a bad idea coming here after all .
you look like a princess .
mr. lal , what do they call the maharaja' s wife ?
his highness has not yet taken a wife .
how interesting .
well , uh , maybe it' s because he hasn' t found the right woman .
his supreme highness , guardian of pankot tradition , the maharaja of pankot ,
zalim singh .
that' s the maharaja ?
a kid ? !
maybe he like older women .
captain blumburtt was just telling me something of the interesting history of the palace ... the importance it played in the mutiny .
it seems the british never forget the mutiny of 1857 .
yes , well , you know , i think there are other events ... before the mutiny , going back a century , back to the time of clive ... that are more interesting .
and what events are those , dr. jones ?
well , if memory serves me correctly , this area , this province , was the center of activity for the thuggee .
ah !
snake ...
surprise .
what' s the surprise ?
dr. jones , you know perfectly well the thuggee cult has been dead for nearly a century .
yes , of course .
the thuggee was an obscenity that worshipped kali with human sacrifices .
the british army nicely did away with them .
well , i suppose stories of the thuggee die hard .
there are no stories anymore .
i' m not so sure .
we came from a small village .
the peasants there told us
pankot palace was growing powerful again because of some ancient evil .
village stories , dr. jones .
they' re just fear and folklore .
you' re beginning to worry captain blumburtt .
i' m not worried , mr. prime minister , just , uh ... just , um , interested .
ah ...
what ?
you are not eating ?
i had bugs for lunch .
give me your hat .
why ?
' cause i' m gonna puke in it .
oh !
you know , the villagers also told us
pankot palace had taken something .
dr. jones , in our country , it' s not usual for a guest to insult his host .
i' m sorry .
i thought we were talking about folklore .
excuse me , sir , do you have anything simple , like soup ?
what exactly was it they say was stolen ?
a sacred rock .
ha !
you see , captain , a rock !
ah !
ah ...
something connected ... the villagers ' rock and the old legend of the sankara stones .
dr. jones , we are all vulnerable to vicious rumors .
i seem to remember that in honduras you were accused of being a grave robber rather than an archaeologist .
well , the newspapers greatly exaggerated the incident .
and wasn' t it the sultan of madagascar who threatened to cut your head off if you ever returned to his country ?
no , it wasn' t my head .
then your hands , perhaps .
no , it wasn' t my hands , it was my ... my misunderstanding .
exactly what we have here , dr. jones .
i have heard the evil stories of the thuggee cult .
i thought the stories were told to frighten children .
later , i learnt the thuggee cult was once real and did of unspeakable things .
i am ashamed of what happened here so many years ago , and i assure you this will never happen again in my kingdom .
if i offended you ... then i am sorry .
ah , dessert !
chilled monkey brains .
uh , i think i' il just check on willie .
that' s all you better do .
tell me later what happened .
am scray .
ah .
i' ve got something for you .
there' s nothing you have that i could possibly want .
right .
oh .
mmm , mmm , mmm .
mmm .
oh , you' re a very nice man .
maybe you could be my palace slave .
wear your jewels to bed , princess ?
yeah .
and nothing else .
that shock you ?
nothing shocks me .
i' m a scientist .
so , as a scientist , you do a lot of research ?
always .
and what sort of research would you do on me ?
nocturnal activities .
you mean like what sort of cream i put on my face at night , what position i like to sleep in ?
mating customs .
love rituals ?
primitive sexual practices .
so you' re an authority in that area ?
years of fieldwork .
oh .
i don' t blame you for being sore at me .
i can be hard to handle .
i' ve had worse .
but you' il never have better .
i don' t know .
as a scientist , i don' t want to prejudice my experiment .
i' il let you know in the morning .
why , you conceited ape .
i' m not that easy .
i' m not that easy , either .
trouble with you is , willie , you' re too used to getting your own way .
and you' re just too proud to admit that you' re crazy about me , dr. jones .
if you want me , willie , you know where you can find me .
five minutes .
you' il be back over here in five minutes .
i' il be asleep in five minutes .
five .
you know it , and i know it .
five minutes .
four and a half .
palace slave .
nocturnal activities .
i' m a " conceited ape " ?
i' il tell you in the morning .
i can' t believe it .
he' s not coming .
she' s not coming .
she' s not coming .
i can' t believe i' m not going .
indiana jones !
this is one night you' il never forget !
this is the night
i slipped right through your fingers !
sleep tight ... and pleasant dreams !
i could have been your greatest adventure .
dr. jones , your whip !
shorty ...
huh ?
turn off the switch .
oh , indy .
oh , be gentle with me .
be gentle with me .
but i' m here .
there' s nobody here .
no , i' m here .
indy , you' re acting awfully strange .
hey , i' m right here .
follow in the footsteps of siva .
what does that mean ?
do not betray these truths .
shorty , go get our stuff .
stay behind me , short round .
step where i step , and don' t touch anything .
i step where you step .
i touch nothing .
indy !
i step on something .
yeah , there' s something on the ground .

it' s not fortune cookies .
let me take a look .
that' s no cookies .
it' s all right .

ow !

a handle that opens the door .

they' re just , just square holes !
go to the right hole .
hurry , willie !
ooh ...

the other right .
your other right !

i can' t do it .
