what' s going on ?
i' m not sure .
what' s up ?
so you show up at your father' s door and say you' re in trouble and the first thing he assumes is i' m pregnant .
is there a question in there ?
i think there' s an interesting story in there .
well , my father thinks i' ve been a little too cavalier in my personal life .
i see .
let me ask you something .
have you ever told someone not a relative " i love you " ?
yes .
more than one someone ?
yes .
oh .
well , then my father would say you' ve been a little too cavalier in your personal life , too .
so you get your sense of absolute certainty from him , do you ?
well , i' m sure i don' t know what you mean .
well , you' re certain the treasure is real , despite what anyone else thinks .
no , but i hope it' s real .
i mean , i' ve dreamt it' s real since my grandfather told me about it .
but i want to hold it .
i feel like i' m so close , i can taste it .
but i just ...
i just want to know it' s not just something in my head or in my heart .
people don' t really talk that way , you know .
i know .
but they think that way .
hey .
did you get it ?
riley ?
oh , i got it .
the vision to see the treasured past comes as the timely shadow crosses in front of the house of pass and stow .
now , " pass and stow " , of course , referring to ...
the liberty bell .
why do you have to do that ?
well , john pass and john stow cast the bell .
ok .
well , then , what does the rest of this mean ?
wait ... " the vision to see the treasured past " must refer to a way to read the map .
well , i thought the cipher was the map .
no , the cipher was a way to find the way to read the map .
and the way to read the map can be found where the " timely shadow " crosses in front of the liberty bell .
crosses in front of the " house " of the liberty bell .
independence hall .
right , so " timely shadow " it' s a specific time .
right .
what time ?
what time ?
what time ?
wait a minute , wait .
you' re gonna love this .
excuse me , can i see one of those hundred dollar bills i paid you with ?
no .
oh .
well , here , i have this diver' s watch .
it' s called a submariner .
i dive with it .
it' s actually quite valuable .
you can use it as collateral .
whatever .
thank you .
on the back of a hundred dollar bill is an etching of independence hall
based on a painting done in ...
hello .
thank you . ... in the 1780s , who ...
the artist was actually a friend of benjamin franklin' s .
it' s wonderful .
fascinating .
hold this .
ok .
i' m not going anywhere .
now , i think that if we look at this clock tower ... ... we may find the specific time .
what do you see ?
2 : 22 .
what time is it now ?
almost three .
we missed it .
no , we didn' t .
we didn' t miss it because ...
you don' t know this ?
i i know something about history that you don' t know .
i' d be very excited to learn about it , riley .
well , hold on one second , let me just ...
let me just take in this moment .
this is ... this is cool .
is this how you feel all the time ?
because , you know ...
except for now , of course .
riley !
all right .
what i know is that daylight savings wasn' t established until world war i.
if it' s 3pm now , ok , that means in 1776 , it would be 2pm .
let' s go .
riley , you' re a genius .
yeah .
do you actually know who the first person to suggest daylight savings was ?
benjamin franklin .
benjamin franklin .
is this real ?
just tell me what you told my friend .
just a bunch of letters .
i can' t remember .
can you remember which ones you were gonna tell him next ?
yeah , here .
s t o w.
liberty bell and independence hall .
imagine its impact back in the 18th century .
it could have been seen for miles around , which was exactly its purpose , because it served as a beacon , as it were , for people to collect and hear ...
good stuff .
it gained a place in history on july 8 , 1776 , when the liberty bell tolled for the first public reading of the declaration of independence .
eventually , it was moved from its place in independence hall steeple and given its own ...
idiot .
who ?
me .
what ?
it' s not here .
it' s there .
come on .
what bell is this ?
it' s the centennial bell .
it replaced the liberty bell in 1876 .
there it is .
all right .
i' m gonna go down there , and you meet me in the signing room .
ok ?
all right .
ok .
all right , let' s go .
3 : 22 .
my idea .
hey .
what' d you score ?
i found this .
some kind of ocular device .
the vision to see the treasured past .
let me take this .
aw , they' re like early american x ray specs .
benjamin franklin invented something like these .
i think he invented these .
so , what do we do with them ?
we look through it .
here , help me .
careful .
you think ?
what ?
it' s just that the last time this was here it was being signed .
ben , there' s another tour coming .
turn it over .
careful .
spectacles .
what do you see ?
what is it ?
is it a treasure map ?
it says , " heere at the wall " , spelled with two e' s .
take a look .
wow .
why can' t they just say , " go to this place , and here' s the treasure , spend it wisely " ?
oh , no .
oh , no .
oh , no .
how' d they find us ?
well , lan has nearly unlimited resources .
and he' s smart .
i don' t think we can get out of here without being spotted .
well , we don' t want them to have the declaration , or the glasses .
but we especially don' t want them to have them both together .
so what do we do ?
we separate the lock from the key .
we' re splitting up .
good idea .
really ?
i' il take this .
and those .
you keep that .
meet me at the car and call me if you have any problems .
like if we get caught and killed ?
yeah .
that would be a big problem .
take care of her .
i will .
i will .
we' re on him .
there he is .
let' s walk this way .
wait up .
shaw , look .
there' s the others .
i got it .
viktor , meet me at fifth and chestnut .
fifth and chestnut .
they' re heading your way .
look out !
look out !
riley !
there they are !
move !
move !
time to run .
keep up , viktor !
move .
come on .
in here .
come on .
follow me .
that way .
if you' re not a steak , you don' t belong here .
i' m just trying to hide from my ex husband .
who , baldy ?
yes .
honey , stay as long as you like .
oh , thank you .
thank you .
you want something ?
do you want something ?
shut up .
i see why you left him .
go around .
go around .
gates !
aw , come on !
where were you ?
hiding .
come on .
let' s go , let' s go .
lan .
lan , i' ve got ' em .
they' re heading toward city hall .
ok , i' m on my way .
out of the way !
they' re headed for the breezeway on the north side .
i' il be right there .
hey , gates !
enough , man !
give me the document .
all right , phil .
watch out !
get out of my way !
watch it !
leave them !
let ' em go .
we' ve got it .
fbl .
have you seen this guy ?
no .
nope , i haven' t seen him .
ted .
philadelphia police found gates' s car .
it' s close .
we got surveillance there now .
let' s go .
tell the boss we got the car .
what ?
we lost it .
what ?
we lost the declaration .
lan took it .
yeah , ok .
you all right ?
you both all right ?
yeah , yeah , we' re all right .
ben , i' m sorry .
we' il be fine .
meet me at the car .
suspect has arrived .
hello , mr gates .
mr gates , face your father' s car and put your hands behind your back , please .
we got one in custody .
gates , you' re a hard man to find .
could you please be careful ?
riley , do you know how to get in touch with lan ?
excuse me ?
that' s some story .
well , it' s the same story i tried to tell you guys before the declaration was stolen .
by you .
no , by lan .
i stole it to stop him .
i did it alone .
dr chase was not involved .
and lan still ended up with the declaration of independence .
because of you .
so here' s your options .
door number one , you go to prison for a very long time .
door number two , we are going to get back the declaration of independence , you help us find it , and you still go to prison for a very long time , but you feel better inside .
is there a door that doesn' t lead to prison ?
someone' s got to go to prison , ben .
yeah .
so what are these for ?
it' s a way to read the map .
right .
knights templar .
freemasons .
invisible treasure map .
so what' d it say ?
" heere at the wall .
nothing else .
it' s just another clue .
it looks like lan howe could be a false identity .
follow up with atf and ins .
there' s more to it .
standard tap procedure .
let' s check the signal , folks .
lock it in .
are we set ?
checking source .
unknown number .
yes .
hello , ben .
how are you ?
um , chained to a desk .
sorry to hear that .
i want you to meet me on the flight deck of the uss intrepid .
you know where that is ?
new york .
meet me there at ten o' clock tomorrow morning .
and bring those glasses you found at independence hall .
yeah , i know about the glasses .
we can take a look at the declaration , and then you can be on your way .
and i' m supposed to believe that .
i told you from the start , i only wanted to borrow it .
you can have it .
and the glasses .
i' il even throw in the pipe from the charlotte .
i' il be there .
and tell the fbi agents listening in on this call if they want the declaration back , and not just a box of confetti , then you' il come alone .
take positions .
perimeter looks normal .
can i get a status report ?
crow' s nest in position .
port side is quiet .
copy that .
gates is on the flight deck .
eyes on gates .
do not lose sight of primary mark .
brian , you' re clear with nypd .
i have a visual .
gates .
stay with the program .
i hope your agents are all under four feet tall and wearing little scarves .
otherwise lan' s gonna know they' re here .
as soon as he shows you the declaration , we' il move in .
don' t try anything .
just let us handle it .
it never works out so well for the bait .
sir , we' ve got some traffic incoming .
looks like a sightseeing helicopter .
unit two , get an eyeball on that chopper .
agent michaels , get faa flight plans and authorization records on that craft .
if that' s not mr howe , i want to know who it is .
i got him .
he' s coming from the north .
gates .
are you with me ?
well , i' m sure not against you , if that' s what you' re asking .
we' ve got some interference on gates' s mike , sir .
this i know .
hello , ben .
thomas edison needed only one way to make a light bulb .
sound familiar ?
keep sightlines clear .
what' s the devil' s going on ?
there' s a lot of commotion .
we can' t see gates .
go to the starboard observation point behind the f 16 and here' s what you do .
gates ?
gates ?
air tour helicopter , you are in controlled airspace .
vacate immediately .
who' s got gates ?
all agents , report in .
i can' t see anything .
did gates speak to anybody ?
target is moving .
he' s heading towards the stern .
i' ve got him .
he' s coming this way .
anyone got a view of our friend lan howe ?
lan howe is not at the stern , sir .
then why is he heading there ?
he' s at the observation deck .
sadusky .
i' m still not against you .
but i found door number three .
and i' m taking it .
what' s he talking about ?
move in !
move in !
move in on gates !
divers are a go .
snipers , go to action zebra .
all teams , move in .
pursue at own risk .
i repeat , pursue at own risk .
you first .
holy mackerel .
he set us up .
agent dawes , do you have a visual ?
can you see gates in the water ?
sir , it' s the hudson .
nothing is visible .
smart fish .
hello , ben .
welcome to new jersey .
what' d you do with abigail and riley ?
hope these fit .
we had to guess your sizes .
i said , what' d you do with abigail and riley ?
he' s the only one who could' ve told you that line about edison .
did you bring the glasses ?
i don' t know .
tell me what' s happening here .
ask your girlfriend .
she' s the one calling all the shots now .
yeah , hello .
it' s for you .
hello .
hi , sweetie .
how' s your day going ?
uh , interesting , dear .
so , what , you working with lan now ?
it turns out helping someone escape from fbi custody is a criminal act .
and he' s the only criminal we knew .
so we called him and made a deal .
well , you' re ...
you' re ... you' re ... you' re all right , yeah ?
i mean you' re safe ?
yeah , we both are .
riley' s right here , doing something clever with a computer .
i' m tracking him through the ...
hey !
i' m tracking you through the gps in shaw' s phone .
they take a turn anywhere we don' t want , we' il know it .
so don' t worry .
if lan tries to double cross us , we can call the fbi and tell them right where you are .
and where to find lan .
and where is that ?
right across the street from where we' re hiding , at the intersection of wall street and broadway .
well , you figured out the clue .
simple .
heere at the wall .
wall street and broadway .
ben , there is a catch .
we made lan believe he could have the treasure .
it was the only way we could get this far .
he' s here .
here we go .
ben .
you all right ?
no broken bones ?
a jump like that could kill a man .
naw , it was cool .
you should try it sometime .
the declaration of independence .
and the meerschaum pipe .
all yours .
that' s it ?
that' s it .
i knew you' d keep your promise .
now , where is it ?
where' s my treasure ?
it' s right here .
the map said " heere at the wall " , spelled with two e' s .
wall street follows the path of an actual wall that the original dutch settlers built as a defence to keep the british out .
the main gate was located at a street called de heere , also two e' s .
later de heere street was renamed broadway after the british got in .
so , " heere at the wall .
broadway , wall street .
cheerio .
just a moment , ben .
lan , if you break our deal , the fbi will be only a few minutes behind you .
you might get away , you might not .
is that all the map said ?
every word .
oh , ben .
you know the key to running a convincing bluff ?
every once in a while you' ve got to be holding all the cards .
dad .
is there anything else you want to tell me ?
trinity church .
we have to go inside trinity church .
good .
excellent .
well , why don' t you ask dr chase and riley to join us ?
i' m sure they' re around here somewhere .
are you all right ?
what do you think ?
i' m a hostage .
sit .
sit down .
let him go , lan .
when we find the treasure .
no , now .
or you can figure out the clues for yourself .
good luck .
ben .
i don' t think you fully appreciate the gravity of the situation .
let' s have a look at that map .
it' s ...
it' s ... it' s really quite something .
it' s ...
it really is remarkable .
take a look .
" parkington lane .
" beneath parkington lane .
but why would the map lead us here , then take us somewhere else ?
what' s the purpose ?
just another clue .
dad .
no , you' re right .
parkington lane has to be here somewhere .
a street inside the church ?
not inside .
beneath .
beneath the church .
i' m so sorry , ben .
none of this is your fault .
i co ...
come on .
look .
cooperation only lasts as long as the status quo is unchanged .
as soon as this guy gets to wherever this thing ends , he won' t need you any more .
or ... or any of us .
so we find a way to make sure the status quo changes in our favour .
how ?
i' m still working on it .
well , i guess i better work on it too , then .
hey !
par ...
hey , i found it !
him !
ben !
it' s a name .
parkington lane .
he was a third degree master mason of the blue lo ...
hey !
stop !
easy .
careful no one steps in him .
all right , put it down .
ok .
who wants to go down the creepy tunnel inside the tomb first ?
right .
mcgregor , viktor , you stay here .
and if anyone should come out without me , well ... use your imagination .
shall we ?
you got a light ?
careful .
watch your step .
come here .
why does that never happen to me ?
what' s this ?
it' s a chandelier .
here .
wow .
look at the elevators .
a dumbwaiter system .
how do a bunch of guys with hand tools build all this ?
same way they built the pyramids and the great wall of china .
yeah .
the aliens helped them .
right , let' s go .
what are we waiting for ?
i' m not going out on that thing .
200 years of termite damage and rot .
dad , do what he says .
watch your step .
we' re right under the trinity graveyard .
that' s probably why no one ever found this .
what is that ?
subway .
shaw !
oh , god , shaw !
oh , my god .
hold on !
hold on !
ok , get on the elevator .
jump !
ben !
grab my hand .
come on .
lan !
abigail !
get on !
jump !
here .
ben !
get down there .
get down there !
the declaration .
do you trust me ?
yes .
oh , no !
ben !
hang on !
son !
i' m sorry .
i' m sorry i dropped you .
i had to save the declaration .
no , don' t be .
i would have done exactly the same thing to you .
really ?
i would have dropped you both .
freaks .
get on .
lan ... it' s not worth it .
do you imagine any one of your lives is more valuable to me than shaw' s ?
we go on .
the status quo .
keep the status quo .
now what ?
this is ...
this is where it all leads .
ok , let' s go .
what is this ?
so where' s the treasure ?
well ?
this is it ?
we came all this way for a dead end ?
yes .
there' s gotta be something more .
riley , there' s nothing more .
another clue , or ...
no , there are no more clues !
that' s it , ok ?
it' s over !
end of the road .
the treasure' s gone .
moved .
taken somewhere else .
you' re not playing games with me , are you , ben ?
hm ?
you know where it is .
no .
ok , go .
hey , wait a minute .
hey !
lan , wait !
wait , wait , wait !
lan ...
we' il be trapped .
don' t do this .
you can' t just leave us here .
yes , i can .
unless ben tells me the next clue .
there isn' t another clue .
lan , why don' t you come back down here and we can talk through this together ?
don' t speak again .
ok .
the clue .
where' s the treasure ?
ben ?
the lantern .
dad ...
the status quo has changed , son .
don' t .
it' s part of freemason teachings .
in king solomon' s temple there was a winding staircase .
it signified the journey that had to be made to find the light of truth .
the lantern is the clue .
and what does it mean ?
boston .
it' s boston .
the old north church in boston , where thomas newton hung a lantern in the steeple , to signal paul revere that the british were coming .
one if by land , two if by sea .
one lantern .
under the winding staircase of the steeple , that' s where we have to look .
thank you .
hey , you have to take us with you .
why ?
so you can escape in boston ?
besides , with you out of the picture there' s less baggage to carry .
what if we lied ?
did you ?
what if there' s another clue ?
then i' il know right where to find you .
see you , ben .
no !
there' s no other way out !
come back !
you' re gonna need us , lan !
we' re all gonna die .
it' s gonna be ok , riley .
i' m sorry i yelled at you .
it' s ok , kiddo .
ok , boys , what' s going on ?
the british came by sea .
it was two lanterns , not one .
lan needed another clue , so we gave it to him .
it was a fake .
it was a fake clue .
the all seeing eye .
through the all seeing eye .
that means ... by the time lan figures it out and comes back here , we' il still be trapped , and he' il shoot us then .
either way , we' re gonna die .
nobody' s gonna die .
there' s another way out .
where ?
through the treasure room .
here .
riley .
looks like someone got here first .
i' m sorry , ben .
it' s gone .
listen , ben ...
it may have even been gone before charles carroll told the story to thomas gates .
it doesn' t matter .
i know .
cos you were right .
no , i wasn' t right .
this room is real , ben .
and that means the treasure is real .
we' re in the company of some of the most brilliant minds in history , because you found what they left behind for us to find and understood the meaning of it .
you did it , ben .
for all of us .
your grandfather , and all of us .
and i' ve never been so happy to be proven wrong .
i just ... really thought i was gonna find the treasure .
ok .
then we just keep looking for it .
i' m in .
ok .
not to be johnny rain cloud here , but that' s not gonna happen .
because as far as i can see , we' re still trapped down here .
yeah .
now , ben , where is this other way out ?
well , that' s it .
it doesn' t make any sense , because the first thing the builders would have done after getting down here was cut a secondary shaft back out for air ...
right . ... and in case of cave ins .
could it really be that simple ?
the secret lies with charlotte .
scrolls from the library at alexandria .
could this be possible ?
it' s a big ... bluish green man , with a strange looking goatee .
i' m guessing that' s significant .
yes !
riley , are you crying ?
look .
stairs .
hi .
do you have a cell phone i could borrow ?
just like that ?
just like that .
you do know you just handed me your biggest bargaining chip ?
the declaration of independence is not a bargaining chip .
not to me .
have a seat .
so what' s your offer ?
how about a bribe ?
say ... ten billion dollars ?
i take it you found the treasure ?
it' s about five stories beneath your shoes .
you know , the templars and the freemasons believed that the treasure was too great for any one man to have , not even a king .
that' s why they went to such lengths to keep it hidden .
that' s right .
the founding fathers believed the same thing about government .
i figure their solution will work for the treasure too .
give it to the people .
divide it amongst the smithsonian , the louvre , the cairo museum ...
there' s thousands of years of world history down there .
and it belongs to the world , and everybody in it .
you really don' t understand the concept of a bargaining chip .
ok , here' s what i want .
dr chase gets off completely clean , not even a little post it on her service record .
ok .
i want the credit for the find to go to the entire gates family , with the assistance of mr riley poole .
and what about you ?
i' d really love not to go to prison .
i can' t even begin to describe how much i would love not to go to prison .
someone' s got to go to prison , ben .
well , if you' ve got a helicopter , i think i can help with that .
freeze !
fbl !
freeze !
don' t move !
show me your hands !
put your hands up .
move , move , move .
you' re under arrest , mr howe .
we' ve got you on kidnapping , attempted murder ... and trespassing on government property .
yeah .
you got it , chief .
thank you .
bye .
they want us in cairo next week for the opening of the exhibit .
they' re sending a private jet .
that' s fun .
yeah , big whoop .
we could have had a whole fleet of private jets .
ten per cent , ben .
they offered you ten per cent and you turned it down .
riley , we' ve been over this .
it was too much .
i couldn' t accept it .
i still have this splinter that' s been festering for three months from an old piece of wood .
ok , i' il tell you what .
next time we find a treasure that redefines history for all mankind , you make the call on the finder' s fee .
that' s not as funny .
what do you care ?
you got the girl .
it' s true .
it' s true .
rub it in .
enjoy your spoils ... while i sit on one per cent .
one stinkin ' per cent .
half of one per cent , actually .
one per cent .
unbelievable .
i' m sorry for your suffering , riley .
for the record , ben , i like the house .
you know , i chose this estate because in 1812 charles carroll met ...
yeah , someone that did something in history and had fun .
great .
wonderful .
could have had a bigger house .
i made something for you .
you did ?
what ?
a map .
a map ?
where does it lead to ?
you' il figure it out .
