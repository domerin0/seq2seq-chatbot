whoa , there !
halt !
who goes there ?
it is i , arthur , son of uther pendragon , from the castle of camelot .
king of the britons , defeater of the saxons .
sovereign of all england !
pull the other one .
i am , and this my trusty servant , patsy .
we have ridden the length of the land in search of knights ... ... who will join me in my court at camelot .
i must speak with your lord and master .
what ?
ridden on a horse ?
yes .
you' re using coconuts !
what ?
you' ve got two empty halves of coconut , and you' re banging them together .
so ?
we have ridden since the snows of winter covered this land .
through the kingdom of mercia .
where did you get the coconuts ?
we found them .
found them ?
in mercia ?
the coconut is tropical .
what do you mean ?
well , this is a temperate zone .
the swallow may fly south with the sun , or the house martin or the plover ... ... may seek warmer climes in winter , yet these are not strangers to our land .
are you suggesting coconuts migrate ?
not at all .
they could be carried .
what ?
a swallow carrying a coconut ? it could grip it by the husk .
it s not a question of where he grips it .
it s a simple question of weight ratio .
a 5 ounce bird could not carry a 1 pound coconut .
it doesn' t matter .
go tell your master that arthur from camelot is here .
in order to maintain air speed velocity ... ... a swallow needs to beat its wings 43 times every second , right ?
please !
am i right ?
i m not interested . it could be carried by an african swallow .
oh , yes !
an african swallow , maybe .
not a european swallow .
that' s my point .
i agree with that .
will you ask your master if he wants to join my court at camelot ?
but then , of course , african swallows are non migratory .
oh , yes .
they couldn' t bring a coconut , anyway .
wait a minute !
supposing two swallows carried it together ?
no , they' d have to have it on a line .
simple .
they' d use a strand of creeper .
held under the dorsal guiding feathers ?
why not ?
bring out your dead !
ninepence .
bring out your dead .
here' s one .
ninepence .
i m not dead !
what ?
nothing .
there' s your ninepence .
i m not dead !
he says he' s not dead .
yes , he is .
i m not !
he isn' t .
he will be soon .
he' s very ill .
i m getting better !
you' il be stone dead in a moment .
i can' t take him like that .
it s against regulations .
i don' t want to go on the cart .
don' t be such a baby .
i can' t take him .
i feel fine .
well , do us a favour .
i can' t .
can you hang around a few minutes ?
he won' t be long .
got to go to the robinsons ' .
they' ve lost nine today .
when' s your next round ?
thursday .
i think i il go for a walk .
you' re not fooling anyone , you know .
isn t there something you can do ?
i feel happy .
thanks very much .
not at all .
see you on thursday .
right .
who' s that , then ?
i don' t know .
must be a king .
why ?
he hasn' t got shit all over him .
old woman !
man !
man .
sorry .
what knight lives in that castle over there ?
i m 37 .
what ?
i m 37 .
i m not old .
i can' t just call you " man .
you could say , " dennis .
i didn' t know you were a dennis .
you didn' t bother to find out .
i did say sorry about the " old woman , " but from behind
what i object to is that you treat me like an inferior .
well , i am king .
king ?
very nice .
how did you get that ?
by exploiting the workers !
by hanging on to outdated imperialist dogma which perpetuates ... ... the economic and social differences in our society !
if there' s ever going to be any progress  there' s some lovely filth down here .
how do you do ?
how do you do , good lady ?
i am arthur , king of the britons .
whose castle is that ?
king of the who ?
the britons .
who are the britons ?
we all are .
we' re all britons .
and i am your king .
didn' t know we had a king .
we' re an autonomous collective .
you' re fooling yourself .
we' re living in a dictatorship .
a self perpetuating autocracy in which the working class
there you go .
bringing class into it again .
that' s what it' s all about .
if only people  please , good people .
i am in haste .
who lives in that castle ?
no one lives there .
who is your lord ?
we don' t have a lord .
what ?
i told you .
we' re an anarcho syndicalist commune .
we take turns to act as a sort of executive officer for the week .
yes .
but all the decisions of that officer ...
... are ratified at a biweekly meeting .
yes , i see .
by majority in the case of internal affairs .
be quiet !
by a two thirds majority in the case of  be quiet !
i order you to be quiet .
order . " who does he think he is ?
i am your king !
i didn' t vote for you .
you don' t vote for kings .
how did you become king then ?
the lady of the lake , her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite ... ... held aloft excalibur from the bosom of the water ... ... signifying , by divine providence , that i , arthur , was to carry excalibur .
that is why i m your king !
listen .
strange women lying in ponds , distributing swords , is no basis ... ... for a system of government .
supreme executive power ... ... derives from a mandate from the masses .
not from some farcical aquatic ceremony .
be quiet !
you can' t expect to wield supreme executive power ... ... ' cause some watery tart threw a sword at you .
shut up !
lf i went around saying i was an emperor ... ... because some moistened bint had lobbed a scimitar at me , they' d put me away !
will you shut up ?
see the violence inherent in the system .
shut up !
see the violence inherent in the system !
help , i m being repressed !
bloody peasant !
what a give away .
did you hear that ?
that' s what i m on about .
did you see him repressing me ?
you fight with the strength of many men , sir knight .
i am arthur , king of the britons .
i seek the finest and bravest knights in the land to join me in camelot .
you have proved yourself worthy .
will you join me ?
you make me sad .
so be it .
come , patsy .
none shall pass .
what ?
none shall pass .
i have no quarrel with you , good sir knight , but i must cross this bridge .
then you shall die .
i command you , as king of the britons , to stand aside .
i move for no man .
so be it !
now , stand aside , worthy adversary .
' tis but a scratch .
" a scratch " ?
your arm' s off .
no , it isn' t .
well , what' s that , then ?
i ve had worse .
you liar .
come on , you pansy !
victory is mine .
we thank thee , lord , that in thy
come on , then .
what ?
have at you .
you are brave , sir knight , but the fight is mine .
had enough , eh ?
look , you stupid bastard .
you' ve got no arms left .
yes , i have .
look !
just a flesh wound .
look , stop that .
chicken !
i il have your leg .
right !
right !
i il do you for that .
you' il what ?
come here .
what are you going to do ?
bleed on me ?
i am invincible !
you' re a loony .
the black knight always triumphs .

come on , then .
all right , we' il call it a draw .
come , patsy .
oh , i see .

a witch !
we found a witch .
we got a witch .
we found a witch .
we' ve got a witch .
burn her !
we have found a witch .
may we burn her ?
burn her !
how do you know she is a witch ?
she looks like one .
bring her forward .
i am not a witch .
but you are dressed as one .
they dressed me up like this .
we didn' t !
and this isn' t my nose .
it s a false one .
well ?
well , we did do the nose .
the nose ?
and the hat .
but she is a witch .
burn her !
did you dress her up like this ?
no .
yes .
yes , a bit .
she has got a wart .
what makes you think she is a witch ?
well , she turned me into a newt .
a newt ?
i got better .
burn her anyway .
burn her !
quiet !
there are ways of telling whether she is a witch .
are there ?
what are they ?
tell us .
do they hurt ?
what do you do with witches ?
burn them !
what do you burn apart from witches ?
more witches !
wood .
so , why do witches burn ?
' cause they' re made of wood ?
good .
so , how do we tell whether she is made of wood ?
build a bridge out of her .
can you not also make bridges of stone ?
oh , yeah .
does wood sink in water ?
no . it floats .
throw her into the pond !
what also floats in water ?
bread .
apples .
very small rocks .
cider .
gravy .
cherries .
nuts .
churches .
lead .
a duck !
exactly .
so , logically ....
if she ... ... weighs the same as a duck ... ... she' s made of wood .
and , therefore ....
a witch !
a witch !
we shall use my largest scales .
right .
remove the supports !
it s a fair cop .
burn her !
who are you , who are so wise in the ways of science ?
i am arthur , king of the britons .
my liege .
good sir knight , will you come to camelot , and join us at the round table ?
my liege , i would be honoured .
what is your name ?
bedevere , my liege .
then i dub you , sir bedevere ... ... knight of the round table .
the wise sir bedevere was the first to join king arthur ' s knights .
but other illustrious names were soon to follow .
sir lancelot the brave .
sir galahad the pure .
and sir robin , the not quite so brave as sir lancelot ... ... who had nearly fought the dragon of angnor ... ... who nearly stood up to the vicious chicken of bristol ... ... and who had personally wet himself at the battle of badon hill .
and the aptly named sir not appearing in this film .
together they formed a band ... ... whose names and deeds were to be retold throughout the centuries .
the knights of the round table .
that , my liege , is how we know the earth to be banana shaped .
this new learning amazes me , sir bedevere .
explain again how sheep' s bladders may be employed to prevent earthquakes .
certainly , sir .
look , my liege .
camelot .
camelot .
camelot . it s only a model .
knights , i bid you welcome to your new home .
let us ride to camelot !
we' re knights of the round table we dance whene' er we' re able
we do routines and chorus scenes with footwork impeccable
we dine well here in camelot we eat ham and jam and spam a lot
we' re knights of the round table our shows are formidable
but many times we' re given rhymes
that are quite unsingable we' re opera mad in camelot
we sing from the diaphragm a lot
quite indefatigable
between our quests we sequin vests
and impersonate clark gable it s a busy life in camelot
i have to push the pram a lot
no , on second thoughts , let' s not go to camelot .
it is a silly place .
right .
arthur .
king of the britons .
don ' t grovel .
if there ' s one thing i can ' t stand , it ' s people grovelling .
sorry .
and don ' t apologize .
every time i talk to someone it ' s " sorry this , " and , " forgive me that " ... ... and , " i ' m not worthy .
what are you doing now ?
i m averting my eyes , o lord .
don ' t .
it ' s like those miserable psalms .
they ' re so depressing .
now , knock it off !
yes , lord .
right .
arthur , king of the britons .
your knights of the round table shall have a task ... ... to make them an example in these dark times .
good idea , o lord !
' course it ' s a good idea .
behold , arthur , this is the holy grail .
look well , arthur , for it is your sacred task to seek this grail .
that is your purpose , arthur .
the quest for the holy grail .
a blessing from the lord .
god be praised !
halt !
hello !
hello !
hello .
who is it ?
it is king arthur , and these are my knights of the round table .
whose castle is this ?
this is the castle of my master , guy de loimbard .
go and tell your master that we have been charged by god ... ... with a sacred quest .
if he will give us food and shelter for the night ... ... he can join us in our quest for the holy grail .
well , i il ask him , but i don' t think he' il be very keen .
he' s already got one , you see .
what ?
he says they' ve already got one !
are you sure he' s got one ?
oh , yes .
it s very nice .
i told him we' ve already got one .
can we come up , and have a look ?
of course not !
you are english types .
well , what are you then ?
i m french .
why do you think i have this outrageous accent , you silly king ?
what are you doing in england ?
mind your own business .
if you will not show us the grail , we shall take your castle by force .
you don' t frighten us , english pig dogs !
go and boil your bottoms , sons of a silly person .
i blow my nose at you , so called arthur king .
you and all your silly english knights .
what a strange person .
now look here , my good man
i don' t want to talk to you no more ... ... you empty headed , animal food trough wiper .
i fart in your general direction .
your mother was a hamster , and your father smelt of elderberries .
is there someone else up there we could talk to ?
no .
now go away , or i shall taunt you a second time .
now , this is your last chance .
i ve been more than reasonable ....
fetchez la vache !
quoi ?
fetchez la vache !
if you do not agree to my commands , then i shall
jesus christ !
right !
charge !
run away !
run away !
fiends !
i il tear them apart .
no , no .
sir , i have a plan , sir .
un cadeau .
what ?
a present .
un cadeau .
oui , allons y .
let' s go .
what happens now ?
well , now , lancelot , galahad , and i wait until nightfall ... ... and then leap out of the rabbit , taking the french by surprise .
not only by surprise , but totally unarmed !
who leaps out ?
lancelot , galahad , and i ... ... leap out of the rabbit .
look .
if we built this large , wooden badger ....
run away !
history for schools .
take 8 .
action !
defeat at the castle seems to have utterly disheartened king arthur .
the ferocity of the french taunting took him completely by surprise .
arthur became convinced that a new strategy was required ... ... if the quest for the holy grail were to be brought to a successful conclusion .
arthur , having consulted his closest knights ... ... decided that they should separate , and search for the grail individually .
now , this is what they did
frank !
the tale of sir robin .
so , each of the knights went their separate ways .
sir robin rode north , through the dark forest of ewing ... ... accompanied by his favourite minstrels .
bravely bold sir robin rode forth from camelot
he was not afraid to die o , brave sir robin
he was not at all afraid to be killed in nasty ways
brave , brave , brave , brave sir robin
he was not in the least bit scared to be mashed into a pulp
or to have his eyes gouged out and his elbows broken
to have his kneecaps split and his body burned away
and his limbs all hacked and mangled brave sir robin
his head smashed in and his heart cut out
his liver removed and his bowels unplugged
his nostrils raped , his bottom burned off and his penis
that' s enough music for now , lads .
looks like there' s dirty work afoot .
anarcho syndicalism is a way of preserving freedom .
dennis , forget about freedom .
don' t drop that mud .
halt !
who art thou ?
" he is brave sir robin , brave sir robin " shut up !
nobody , really .
i was just passing through .
what do you want ?
" to fight and " shut up !
nothing .
nothing , really .
just to pass through , good sir knight .
i ' m afraid not .
actually , i am a knight of the round table .
you ' re a knight of the round table ?
i am .
in that case , i have to kill you .
shall i ?
i don ' t think so .
what do i think ?
kill him .
let ' s be nice to him .
shut up .
but
and you !
get the sword out .
i want to cut his head off !
cut your own head off .
yes , do us all a favour .
what ?
yapping on all the time .
you ' re lucky you ' re not next to him .
what do you mean ?
you snore .
i don ' t .
you ' ve got bad breath .
only because you don ' t brush my teeth .
stop bitching , and let ' s go and have tea !
all right !
we ' il kill him first , and then have tea and biscuits .
yes .
not biscuits .
all right !
not biscuits .
but let ' s kill him anyway .
right .
he ' s buggered off !
so he has !
he ' s scarpered .
" brave sir robin ran away " no !
" bravely ran away , away " i didn' t .
when danger reared its ugly head he bravely turned his tail and fled
yes , brave sir robin turned about and gallantly he chickened out
bravely taking to his feet he beat a very brave retreat
" bravest of the brave , sir robin " i never !

the tale of sir galahad .
open the door .
in the name of king arthur , open the door !
hello !
welcome , gentle sir knight .
welcome to the castle anthrax .
the castle anthrax ?
yes .
it s not a very good name , is it ?
but we are nice , and we will attend to your every , every need !
you are the keepers of the holy grail ?
the what ?
the grail .
it is here ?
but you are tired , and you must rest awhile .
midget !
crapper !
yes , o zoot ?
prepare a bed for our guest .
thank you , zoot .
thank you .
away , away , varletesses !
the beds here are warm and soft , and very , very big .
look , i  what is your name , handsome knight ?
sir galahad the chaste .
mine is zoot .
just zoot .
but come .
please , in god' s name , show me the grail .
you have suffered much .
you are delirious .
look , i have seen it .
it is here .
sir galahad !
you would not be so ungallant as to refuse our hospitality .
i m afraid our life must seem very dull and quiet , compared to yours .
we' re 8 score blondes and brunettes , all between 16 and 19 and a half ... ... cut off in this castle , with no one to protect us .
it is a lonely life .
bathing , dressing , undressing , making exciting underwear .
we are just not used to handsome knights .
nay .
come .
you may lie here .
but you are wounded !
no , it' s nothing !
you must see the doctors immediately .
please , lie down .
well , what seems to be the trouble ?
they' re doctors ?
they have a basic medical training .
come , come , you must try to rest .
dr. piglet !
dr. winston !
practice your art .
try to relax .
are you sure that' s absolutely necessary ?
we must examine you .
there' s nothing wrong with that .
please .
we are doctors .
look , this cannot be .
i am sworn to chastity !
back to your bed !
torment me no longer .
i have seen the grail .
there' s no grail here .
i have seen it .
i have seen  hello .
hello .
zoot !
i am zoot' s identical twin sister , dingo .
where are you going ?
i seek the grail .
i have seen it here in this castle !
oh , no .
bad , bad zoot !
what is it ?
wicked , bad , naughty zoot !
she has been setting light to our beacon , which is grail shaped .
it s not the first time we' ve had this problem .
it s not the real grail ?
wicked , bad , naughty , evil zoot .
she is a bad person , and must pay the penalty .
do you think this scene should have been cut ?
we were so worried when the boys were writing it .
but now we' re glad .
it s better than some previous scenes , i think .
ours was better visually .
ours was committed .
it wasn' t a string of pussy jokes .
get on with it .
yes .
get on with it !
get on with it !
i am enjoying this scene .
get on with it !
wicked , wicked zoot !
she must pay the penalty .
in castle anthrax , we have a punishment for setting alight the grail shaped beacon .
you must tie her down on a bed , and spank her .
a spanking !
a spanking !
you must spank her , and after you' ve spanked her , deal with her as you like .
and , then , spank me .
and me !
and me .
and me .
yes .
you must give us all a good spanking !
a spanking !
and , after the spanking , the oral sex .
the oral sex !
well , i could stay a bit longer .
sir galahad !
hello .
quick !
you are in great peril .
why ?
no , he isn' t !
silence , foul temptress !
she' s got a point .
we' il cover your escape !
look , i m fine !
wait , sir galahad !
i can tackle this lot single handed !
yes , let him tackle us single handed !
no , sir galahad .
come !
honestly , i can handle this lot easily !
yes , let him handle us easily .
no , sir .
quick !
wait !
please !
i can defeat them !
there' s only 150 of them !
he' il beat us easily .
we haven' t a chance .
oh , shit !
you were in great peril .
i don' t think i was .
you were in terrible peril .
let me go back , and face the peril .
no , it' s too perilous .
it s my duty to sample as much peril as i can .
we' ve got to find the holy grail .
let me have just a bit of peril ?
no . it s unhealthy .
i bet you' re gay .
no , i m not .
but , they were still no nearer the grail .
king arthur and sir bedevere , not more than a swallow ' s flight away ... ... had discovered something .
that ' s an unladen swallow ' s flight , obviously .
they were more than two laden swallow ' s flights away .
four , with a coconut on a line between them .
if the birds were
get on with it !
oh , anyway ... ... on to scene 24 , which is a smashing scene , with some lovely acting ... ... in which arthur discovers a vital clue .
there aren ' t any swallows , but i think you can hear a
and this enchanter of whom you speak , he has seen the grail ?
where does he live ?
old man , where does he live ?
he knows of a cave .
a cave which no man has entered .
and the grail .
the grail is there ?
there is much danger .
for beyond the cave lies the gorge of eternal peril ... ... which no man has ever crossed .
but the grail .
where is the grail ?
seek you the bridge of death .
the bridge of death ?
which leads to the grail ?
who are you ?
we are the knights who say , " ni " !
no !
not the knights who say " ni " ?
the same !
who are they ?
we are the keepers of the sacred words .
ni , " " peng , " and " neee wom " !
those who hear them seldom live to tell the tale .
the knights who say , " ni " demand a sacrifice .
knights of ni , we are but simple travellers ... ... who seek the enchanter who lives beyond these woods .
ni !
ni !
we shall say , " ni " again to you , if you do not appease us .
what is it you want ?
we want ... ... a shrubbery .
a what ?
ni !
ni !
please !
no more !
we will find you a shrubbery .
you must return with a shrubbery ... ... or else you will never pass through this wood ... ... alive .
knights of ni , you are just and fair .
we will return with a shrubbery .
one that looks nice .
of course .
and not too expensive .
yes .
now go !
stop that !
stop that !
go on , be off !
go away .
and you , be off !
bloody weather .
the tale of sir lancelot .
one day , lad , all this will be yours .
what , the curtains ?
no , not the curtains .
all that you can see , stretched out over the hills and valleys .
that' il be your kingdom , lad .
but , mother .
father , lad .
but , father , i don' t want any of that .
listen , lad .
i built this kingdom up from nothing .
when i started here , it was a swamp .
other kings said i was daft to build a castle on the swamp .
but i built it all the same to show them .
it sank into the swamp .
so , i built a second one .
that sank into the swamp .
so , i built a third one .
that burned down , fell over , then sank in the swamp .
but the fourth one stayed up .
and that' s what you' il get , lad .
the strongest castle in these isles .
but i don' t want any of that .
i' d rather  rather what ?
i' d rather just ... ... sing .
stop that .
you' re not going into a song while i m here !
in 20 minutes , you' re marrying a girl ... ... whose father owns the biggest tracts of open land in britain .
but i don' t want land .
listen , alice .
herbert .
herbert .
we live on a bloody swamp , we need all the land we can get .
but i don' t like her .
don' t like her ?
what' s wrong with her ?
she' s beautiful , she' s rich .
she' s got huge ... ... tracts of land .
i know , but i want the girl that i marry to have ... ... a certain special something .
cut that out !
you' re marrying princess lucky , so you' d better get used to the idea !
guards !
make sure the prince doesn' t leave the room until i get him .
not to leave the room , even if you come and get him .
no .
until i come and get him .
until you come and get him , we' re not to enter the room .
no , you stay in the room and make sure he doesn' t leave .
and you' il come and get him .
right .
we don' t need to do anything , apart from stop him entering the room .
no .
leaving the room .
leaving the room , yes .
all right ?
lf ....
lf we' re  yes ?
look , it' s quite simple .
you stay here and make sure he doesn' t leave the room .
all right ?
i remember .
can he can he leave the room with us ?
no , you just keep him in here , and make sure
yes !
we' il keep him in here , obviously .
but if he had to leave  no .
keep him in here !
until you , or anyone  not anyone , just me .
just you ....
get back .
right ?
right .
we' il stay here until you get back .
and make sure he doesn' t leave .
what ?
make sure he doesn' t leave .
the prince ?
yes , make sure he doesn' t leave .
yes , of course !
i thought you meant him !
it seemed a bit daft me having to guard him when he' s a guard .
is that clear ?
quite clear .
no problems .
right .
where are you going ?
we' re coming with you .
i want you to stay here , and make sure he doesn' t leave .
i see , right .
but , father  shut it , and get that suit on .
and no singing !
go and get a glass of water .
well taken , concorde !
thank you , sir , most kind .
and again !
over we go !
good , steady !
now , the big one !
come on , concorde !
message for you , sir .
concorde , speak to me !
to whoever finds this note ...
... i have been imprisoned by my father ...
... who wishes me to marry against my will .
please , please come and rescue me .
i am in the tall tower of swamp castle .
at last !
a call !
a cry of distress !
this could be the sign that leads us to the holy grail !
brave concorde , you shall not have died in vain !
i m not quite dead , sir .
you shall not have been mortally wounded in vain !
i think i could pull through , sir .
i see .
i think i m all right to come with you .
no , sweet concorde !
stay here .
i will send help as soon as i have accomplished a daring and ... ... heroic rescue in my own particular ....

we are here today to witness the union of two young people ... ... in the joyful bond of holy wedlock .
unfortunately , one of them , my son herbert ... ... has just fallen to his death .
but i don' t want to think i ve lost a son , so much as ... ... gained a daughter .
for , since the tragic death of her father
he' s not quite dead !
since the near fatal wounding of her father
he' s getting better !
for , since her own father ... ... who , when he seemed about to recover ... ... suddenly felt the icy hand of death upon him .
he' s died !
i want his only daughter to look upon me ... ... as her own dad , in a very real , and legally binding sense .
and i feel sure that the merger ....
the union between the princess ... ... and the brave but dangerous sir lancelot of camelot
what ?
look , the dead prince !

old crone !
is there anywhere in this town where we could buy a shrubbery ?
who sent you ?
the knights who say , " ni " !
no !
we have no shrubberies here .
if you do not tell us where we can buy a shrubbery , my friend and i ... ... will say ....

yes .
what sad times are these when passing ruffians can say , " ni " at will to old ladies .

nothing is sacred .
even those who arrange shrubberies are under considerable economic stress ... ... at this period in history .
did you say " shrubberies " ?
yes .
shrubberies are my trade .
i am a shrubber .
my name is roger the shrubber .
i arrange , design , and sell shrubberies .
ni !
no !
knights of ni , we have brought you your shrubbery .

it is a good shrubbery .
i like the laurels particularly .
but there is one small problem .
what is that ?
we are now no longer the knights who say " ni .
ekke ekke ekke ptang zoo boing " !
therefore , we must give you a test .
what' s is this test , knights who until recently said " ni " ?
firstly , you must find ... ... another shrubbery !
not another shrubbery !
then you must bring it here beside this shrubbery .
higher , so you get the two level effect , a path going down the middle .
a path !
a path !
then , when you have found the shrubberies ... ... you must cut down the mightiest tree in the forest ... ... with a herring !
we shall do no such thing .
please .
cut down a tree with a herring ?
it can' t be done .
don' t say that word .
what word ?
i cannot tell .
suffice to say ... ... it' s one of the words the knights of ni cannot hear .
how can we not say the word if you don' t tell us what it is ?
he did it again .
what ?
is " ?
you wouldn' t get very far in life not saying " is .
my liege , it' s robin .
he' s jacking it in and packing it up and sneaking away and buggering up
and chickening out and pissing a pot yes , bravely he is throwing in the sponge
robin .
my liege .
it s good to see you .
you haven' t given up your quest for the holy grail ?
" he is sneaking away and " shut up !
no , far from it .

that' s it !
i ve said , " it . " i ve said , " it .

that' s three " its " !
and so arthur and bedevere and sir robin set out on their search to find ... ... the enchanter of whom the old man had spoken in scene 24 .
beyond the forest they met lancelot and galahad ... ... and there was much rejoicing .
in the frozen land of nador ... ... they were forced to eat robin ' s minstrels .
and there was much rejoicing .
a year passed .
winter changed into spring .
spring changed into summer .
summer changed back into winter ... ... and winter gave spring and summer a miss and went straight on into autumn .
until one day .
knights ... ... forward !
what manner of man are you , that can summon up fire ...
... without flint or tinder ?
i am an enchanter .
by what name are you known ?
there are some who call me ... ... tim .

a grail ?
yes , i think so .

look , you' re a busy man
yes , i can help you find the holy grail .
to the north , there lies a cave .
the cave of caerbannog .
wherein , carved in mystic runes , upon the very living rock ... ... the last words of olfin bedwere of rheged ... ... make plain the last resting place of the most holy grail .
where could we find this cave , tim ?
follow !
but follow only if ye be men of valour .
for the entrance to this cave is guarded by a creature ... ... so foul , so cruel ... ... that no man yet has fought with it and lived .
bones of full 50 men lie strewn about its lair .
so , brave knights ... ... if you do doubt your courage or your strength , come no further ... ... for death awaits you all with nasty , big , pointy teeth .
what an eccentric performance !
they' re nervous , sire .
then we' d best leave them here and carry on , on foot .
dismount !
behold the cave of caerbannog !

shut up and change your armour .

it may become so cross , that it will make a mistake .
like what ?

bring up the holy hand grenade .
how does it ....
how does it work ?
i know not , my liege .

9 21 .
and st. attila raised the hand grenade up on high , saying : " ' o lord , bless this thy hand grenade , that with it thou mayest ...
' ... blow thine enemies to tiny bits , in thy mercy . '
and the lord did grin and the people did feast upon ...
... the lambs and sloths and carp and anchovies and orangutans ...
... and breakfast cereals and fruit bats and
skip a bit , brother .
the lord spake , saying , ' first shalt thou take out the holy pin ...
' ... then shalt thou count to three , no more , no less .
' three shalt be the number thou shalt count ...
' ... and the number of the counting shalt be three . " ' four shalt thou not count , neither count thou two ...
' ... excepting that thou then proceed to three .
' five is right out .
' once the number three , being the third number be reached ...
' ... then lobbest thou thy holy hand grenade of antioch ...
' ... towards thy foe , who , being naughty in my sight ...
' ... shall snuff it . " '
amen .
amen .
right .
one , two , five !
three , sir !

' ... may find the holy grail ...
' ... in the castle of aaargh . " '

perhaps he was dictating it .
shut up !
does it say anything else ?

it s the legendary black beast of aaargh !
that' s it !
run away !
we' ve lost him .
as the horrendous black beast lunged forward ... ... escape for arthur and his knights seemed hopeless .
when , suddenly , the animator suffered a fatal heart attack .
the cartoon peril was no more .
the quest for the holy grail could continue .
there it is !
