that wave was huge .
i would have never gone .
she was perfectly positioned .
if she had the balls to charge ...
why does the sun rise in the east ?
what ?
why does the sun rise in the east ?
because it sets in the west .
because that' s the way the earth rotates .
do you remember that superman episode ... where he was , like , spinning around the earth backwards ... trying to rotate it in the other direction ?
yeah .
yeah , yeah .
to bring back time ?
i thought you finished .

hi , mr. pakui .
anne marie , this is the eighth time ... your sister' s been tardy in the last month .
i know .

if you think surfing is more important than school , we got to make other arrangements .
you know what , mr. pakui , the only other arrangement i can think of is my mother .
and she just so happens to be with her latest meal ticket in vegas ... who apparently isn' t so cool with the kid' s menu , you know what i mean ?
so right now , this is the best arrangement i can do .
you know , penny' s a smart girl .
yeah , she is .
just like her sister was .

my sisters would beat me on a regular basis .
see , look .

## [ drumming continues , muffled ]
anne marie .
anne marie .
what the hell are you doin ' ?
i don' t know , matt .
what am i doing ?
the other day , when i was ordering room service , the guy on the phone called me mrs. tollman , and i didn' t correct him .
' cause for a minute ,
i liked the way it sounded .
and i was just wondering if the denny' s waitress felt the same way .
listen ...
you know what ?
i' m fine , okay .
i know what i am , and i' m fine with it .
what ?
who are you ?
i' m the maid that you slept with on vacation .
i' m the great story you tell when someone asks you how you learned to surf .
you don' t trust anybody , do you ?
can i ?
can i trust you ?
to do what ?
i mean ...
what do you want ?
what do i want ?
oh , my god .
i want ...
penny to quit smoking and to go to college .
i want ...
i want to be able to pay the phone and the electricity ... and the rent all in the same month .
i want a girl to be on the cover of surf magazine , and that would be great if that girl were me , but any girl would do .
and i want ...
i mean , i wish my mom would come home .
and i really , really want to win pipe masters tomorrow .
that' s what i want .
well , do it .
matt , you don' t understand , okay ?
pipe ...
pipe is the heaviest wave in the world .
okay , you don' t just get worked there .
you die .
people die there .
and what happens when i just ... when i paddle out and i don' t take off on a single wave ?
i don' t care if i make a fool out of myself , but i do not want to embarrass my family .
and that' s what lena and eden and penny are .
they' re my family .
just tell me what to do , please .
you want me to tell you what to do ?
yes .
you know what to do .
no , matt , i honestly don' t .
just be the girl i met on the beach .
who ?
who was she ?
a girl who' d never ask a guy what to do .
good morning , everybody .
welcome to the pipe masters ... here at banzai pipeline on the north shore of oahu .
you' re gonna be watching women' s surfng history today ... as these girls take on the deadliest waves in the world .
imagine the niagara falls dumping into two feet of water over hard rock lava ... with razor sharp reef and underwater caves .
it' s gonna be a macking 20 feet .
good luck to all the ladies competing today at the pipe masters .
they may be the best in the world , but they' re gonna have their hands full today .
if you' re going down to watch , it' s not a day for a dip in the water .
anne marie , you all right ?
mm hmm .
you guys get out here .
i' il go find some parking .
pretty much an impossible score at this point .
she' s way behind , but she' s still gonna try and put it on the line .
looks like she' s goin' for this one .
oh . !
she broke her board .
any day at pipeline , it' s critical , but today , one false move and the consequences could be disastrous .
more surfers have died here than any other spot on the planet combined .
this is the first time the girls have gotten to compete at pipeline .
the entire surfcommunity is here today ... every sponsor , talent scout , the entire surf media ... looking to find the next surfsensation .
get one good ride here today , and you' il put yourself on the surfng map .
out there all by herself is lynette mackenzie , now that megan' s on the beach with a broken board .
she' s in on a nice one .
she' s comin' in .
you really have to commit if you are gonna get those waves .
but i' m sure it' il better the score she already has .
good luck , layne .
thanks .
i could use it .
i' m here for the competition .
are you a volunteer ?
she' s a competitor .
you need to sign this release form .
in case of death or dismemberment " ?
thank you .

you can go ahead and wait in the competitors ' area .
thank you .

oh , my gosh .
there' s kate skarratt .
she kills at pipe .
and there' s rochelle ballard .
she' s queen ofback door .
oh , my gosh . !
layne beachley is ...

i' m just saying ... they' re ... they' re really good .
shit . !
come on .
let' s go .
hey !
what' s up , man ?
what' s up ?
where' s parking around here ?
anywhere , i guess whatever you can find .
looks like she' s goin' on this one .
hey .
hey , anne marie .
look what i found .
next heat , keala kennelly .
hey .
just driving by .
what' s up , surfer girl ?
do the damn thing .
shit .
twenty foot swell on the rise .
pretty weird out there .
it' s a super clean , west northwest swell .
pipe and back door are both open .
yeah .
just be patient .
don' t get too anxious .
it' s four wave sets with 20 second intervals .
take your time .
don' t take the first wave of the set .
third wave looks the best .
here comes kennelly taking off .
steep drop .
she makes the bottom turn .
she' s fierce , man .
gets covered up .
oh . !
she makes it out .
let' s give her a warm round of applause .
i' m way out of my league .
hey .
no worries .
just go out there and have fun .
fun .
up next , from australia , we have kate skarratt in red .
she' s a goofy foot , which favors her at pipeline .
loves charging big waves and has taken first place at teahupoo , another barreling left hander in tahiti .
surfng against her , we have wild card entry , anne marie chadwick , a formerjunior nssa champion who dropped out of the competitive circuit ... after a near drowning incident at this very spot just three years ago .
five , four , three , two , one .
we' ve got 20 minute heats today with the top four waves scoring .
wave selection is critical .
if you pick the wrong wave , wipe out , get caught inside ...
you could spend the rest of your heatjust trying to get back to the lineup .
how' s it goin ' ?
good .
nice set approaching .
got good sets out the back .
we have really good consistency with swell .
it' s on the rise .
probably gonna get up to about 15 to 20 feet .
kate skarratt' s goin ' on this one .
she' s paddling , gets to her feet .
makes the drop .
solid bottom turn .
look at that pit . !
she' s setting her line , racing to make it out .
trying to get to the shoulder .
traveling ...
oh . !
she didn' t quite get around that last turn .
she' il get some kind of score for it .
looks like it' s a 4 .
1 that came in on the board .
water patrol' s checking on her .
looks like she' s okay .
if she doesn' t need a ride , she can paddle back out .
so chadwick all alone by herself out there , yet to even score a ride .
go , go !
paddle !
headed for her first ride .
backs out .
shit !
beautiful wave .
she' s not gonna get any more like that .
what a waste of wave .
she should' ve gone .
that would have opened up perfectly .
shit !
when you' re out there all alone , you can psyche yourself out .
you can do it , girl .
chadwick will have to wait for the next set .
what are you doin ' ?
kate skarratt' s paddling into one of the best waves of the day .
0h . !
look at this wave .
it is a bomb .
oh . !
she' s a little overextended and goes down .
hope she' s okay out there .
kate skarratt down .
ooh .
great pickup .
gets her on the sled , out ofharm' s way .
hang on .
okay , everybody , as the ski comes up on the beach , please give them some room .
the water patrol needs some space to work .
skate skarratt has gone down on that last wave .
they' re carrying the backboard down .
this isn' t good .
we need dr. leland dao to report to the medical tent .
leland dao , please report to the medical tent .
we need you down here immediately .
come on .
come on .
charge it !
go , go , go !
go !
go !
go !
go !
go !
she sets her rail .
makes the drop .
textbook .
oh . !
it' s setting up perfectly .
look at that .
beautiful wave .
she should get a nice score for this one , yes ! high enough to take her into the next round .
oh . !
oh , she got so worked .
i don' t see her .
where is she ?
man , is she all right ?
where is she ?
oh !
anne marie' s taking a heavy beating out there .
grab my hand .
i got you .
hang on .
not that she cares right now , but thejudges ' scores havejust come in ... and they' ve awarded her a 4 . 6 for the last ride , which will move her into the next round over skarratt .
anne marie !
are you okay ?
is she gonna be all right ?
is she gonna be all right ?
she' il be okay .
just give her some room .
is she gonna be okay ?
i think so .
i' m gonna put some ice on it .
lift your head .
just lay there and relax for a minute .
hey .
if you tell me to be the girl on the beach right now , i' m gonna kick your ass .
oh .
so how are you feelin ' ?
i' ve been better .
yeah .
my , uh , my first nfl game ,
i got blindsided by warren sapp .
i tell you , i' ve never been hit so hard in my life .
i lay there praying something was broken so i wouldn' t have to get up and finish the game .
you think i' m faking ?
no .
i know you got rocked out there .
just like i did .
but leslie sat me down , said that was the hardest i' d ever be hit and that i would regret not going back in .
so i ...
i went back in .
and you won the game .
no .
actually , we lost .
and i got my ass kicked .
but there' s this one beautiful pass ... one perfect spiral right into omar' s fingertips ... and a touchdown .
look , i can' t talk you into goin' back out there .
it' s ...
it seems crazy .
but i know how good you are , and i know how much this means to you .
i just don' t want you to spend your life wondering what could have been .
heads up on the beach , people .
big set approaching .
hey , everybody , we have a set out the back .
watch your kids .
watch your belongings .
the water is coming over the berm .
it' s dangerous out there .
the water patrol already has their hands full , so we' d appreciate it if you' djust back up .
here today we have a rising swell , so i wanna give a little word of warning to everybody to watch out .
guys , look , this is really not a good time .
can i get a picture ?
what ?
can we get a picture ?
we' re working these chicks here .
they think you' re some kind of great hockey player or something .
you' re kidding .
no joke .
we wanna get this thing done .
sorry my pits stink .
that' s just the way it goes .
let' s go .
right here .
smile .
you' re on vacation .
this way , this way .
fluff your bangs a little bit .
a little more attitude .
beautiful .
one more .
all right , great .
hey .
hey .
you goin ' back out there ?
yup .
it' s just a stupid contest .
it' s not worth getting hurt over .
i' il be fine .
hey .
what ?
be careful .
yeah .
that sounds the start of the next heat .
chadwick' s pretty much got her hands full this next round .
keala kennelly from hawaii .
she' s a charger .
she' il go on anything .
she goes like a man out here .
bit of a paddle battle going on out there .
looks like chadwick and kennelly are paddling for the peak .
chadwick' s got the inside position .
lf a big set approaches , she' s gonna get the first wave .
come on , come on .
this paddle battle is really about who' s gonna get the first wave .
chadwick in position , heading for the first wave .
starts to paddle .
she' s goin' for it .
oh . !
she ...
she pulls back .
kennelly' s wide open .
she catches a wave .
time and time again , man .
she' s out , making it look so easy .
but , folks , it' s not easy out there .
chadwick starts to paddle .
she paddles for it .
doesn' t quite get it .
what a waste of wave .
that' s gotta hurt when you know you need a score , and you' re going up against one of the best surfers in this event , and you don' t go .
plenty of time being allowed here for kennelly to get back in position , and she' s paddled right inside of chadwick , and she' s looking to catch her next wave .
keala kennelly .
hands together , ladies and gentlemen .
keala kennelly .
a great two ride out here at the pipeline .
keala' s got sack .
she goes like the men out here .
for some reason , chadwick has yet to even ride a wave .
i don' t know what' s going on .
i don' t know if she' s just psyching herself out or if keala' s putting it to her .
what are you doin ' ?
what ?
you gonna take a wave or just sit there like a buoy ?
look , you' re never gonna catch a wave sitting all the way over here .
follow me .
i' il get you into one .
give the crowd something to cheer about .
let' s get you a wave .
come on .
follow me into the lineup , and i' m gonna tell you to go on a wave .
and when i tell you to go , you gotta go .
paddle your little heart out .
you can' t hesitate .
you can' t pull back .
you can' t hold back .
no fear , all right ?
' cause if you hold back for a second , you' re gonna eat shit .
come on .
follow me .
it looks like the next set' s approaching .
this is the one .
go .
paddle !
paddle !
go , girl !
paddle !
paddle !
paddle . !
ah !
go . !
oh !
you all right ?
i' m okay , i' m okay .
get back out there then .
with only two minutes left in her heat ,
chadwick struggles to get back into the lineup ... so she can catch a scoring wave .
chadwick has yet to even score a good ride , a scoring ride .
she needs to redeem herself .
keala is absolutely dominating this heat , and chadwick needs to put a scoring ride on the board .
ouch .
are you all right ?
that was nasty .
it' s okay .
i want another one .
you want another one ?
that' s the spirit .
yup .
shake off that last wave , and let' s do this .
less than 20 seconds left .
feel that adrenaline .
use it .
come on .
anne marie chadwick only has one more chance .
on the outside .
here comes one of the best sets of the whole day .
we have lines stacked to the horizon .
here comes a set .
this is the one .
all right , come on .
go . !
go , go . !
go , girl . !
chadwick' s out there .
paddle hard !
go !

waiting for thejudges' scores .

looks like unanimous tens across the board , but not enough to overtake kennelly and move into the next round .
but she is a hero with the crowd here today .
that' s my sister !
whoo !
that' s my sister !
just words don' t explain it .
for anne marie chadwick to get a ride like that ... with the entire north shore surfng community watching ...
