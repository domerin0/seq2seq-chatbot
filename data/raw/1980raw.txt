looks like they had a quiet night .
my army of souls .
ready to travel to distant lands .
was she crying ?
no .
she was awake .
they just need to be cuddled .
you spoil them .
of course i do .
a spider bit me .
shut up .
wanna wash windshields today ?
thieves !
little bastards !
beat it !
one eye !
one eye !
go fuck yourself !
little thugs .
it' s our turn to sing today .
great .
i remember it .
but that was the year i had to leave .
you never got to sing it ?
just in rehearsals .
mami was really sick .
it' s better if you wait .
you need to wear your shoes .
they hurt me .
they' re too small .
well , put them on before you go inside the school .
he' s so bad .
he hangs out with that gang that tortures the dogs .
liar !
shut up !
take care of the stove .
and do what you can with him .
which one do you work in ?
the posada santa marta .
do the mothers leave you tips ?
not many .
but if you need diapers , it' s heaven .
i' ve only got ten cents .
tough shit .
can you rent it ?
how much ?
ten cents .
you don' t bring it back , i break your arm .
if you can catch me !
six bags of trash i emptied .
people are so filthy .
is she here yet ?
as always .
any problems ?
214 as usual .
not enough pressure in the shower and the ac is too loud .
witch .
they want to be mothers and they can' t even take of themselves .
good morning , ma' am .
excuse me .
your clerks said i should ask you if there' s any work .
right now there' s nothing .
i' m available right away ...
really , there' s nothing .
i can do whatever .
i can cook , clean .
i can ...
if i hire you , i have to pay the others less .
it' s already tough for them to make a living .
i understand .
thanks .
is there somewhere else i could ... ?
i' m sorry .
a crazy woman .
breast strokes right through the ice cubes .
must be the aryan blood .
her people are mostly swedish ...
lutherans .
buenos das .
rubn .
buenos das .
sennora .
and will the ladies be taking a liquid this morning ?
and why not ?
a fruit plate , por favor . and a joo go of orange .
it' s jugo .
not joo go .
give me a break here .
you' re so good at it .
i studied it .
yeah , but you' ve got an ear .
i just sound like some old cracker .
it will arrive suddenly .
the children are so adorable .
you just wanna bake them some cookies and give them a bath .
morning , ladies .
hi .
our water sprite in her element ?
building her calorie debt .
don' t i wish i had one of those .
is eileen coming down ?
we knocked , but she said she' s not hungry .
ga" s missing a lot of meals .
she' s on a budget ...
eileen .
i' il say .
woman gives two centavos to some little beggar boy , it goes right in that notebook of hers .
she doesn' t bitch and moan about the prices like some people .
bargaining is a respected part of the culture here .
if you don' t complain , they take advantage of you .
besides , she' s a professor .
she' s in clerical .
at a university .
which probably pays worse than publishing .
i think her husband is between jobs .
unemployed .
actually , no .
i think he' s freelancing .
he' s looking for a job and hasn' t found one yet ... unemployed .
so they lied on the application .
or he got laid off after it went through .
do you suppose the fellow back there could do me up a pair of eggs , over easy , so they' re not runny , but they' re not scabby on the outside ?
i will order it done .
and bacon ... crispy , so you break it .
you don' t tear it .
we will attempt to comply with this , sennora .
and fruit plate ?
you take the even ones and i' il take the odd ones .
excuse me .
socorro ?
right ?
ascension ?
i knew it was some religious holiday .
buenos das ...
can i get another one ?
they' re catholic .
so ?
that might make a difference down here with the agency people .
if somebody stipulates that the kid has to be raised catholic , yeah .
they can do that ?
why not ?
seems like under the circumstances ...
beggars can' t be choosers .
i think that might be the motto at the orphanage ...
maybe faith is different .
you must' ve told them you' il raise yours up in your sect .
religion .
and that child' s parents have no say in the matter .
she' s been skipping dinner a lot , too ...
eileen .
room service .
no , i don' t ever see any trays in front of her door in the morning .
maybe we oughta find a way to treat , then , and just not make a big deal about it .
easy , easy now .
you' re so lucky .
you' il have a car with its own little house .
you' il go to a pretty school with all the yankee kids .
you' il have perfect teeth and a huge bedroom .
let him breathe .
the expert .
my grandmother did this job , and my mother , too .
they did it nature' s way .
nature' s way ?
breast feeding .
wet nurses ?
right here .
have you ever tried it ?
wash your windshield ?
wash your windshield ?
she' s only 30 .
how can she be sick of men already ?
that' s what she said .
she' s a dyke .
she is not .
she might as well be one with the attitude she' s got .
have you seen her tattoo ?
how can you see anything ?
she won' t wear a bathing suit like a normal person .
it' s an ankh .
what' s an ankh ?
her tattoo .
right , but what is that ?
and where is it ?
it' s on her heinie .
how did you see it there ?
what' s an ankh ?
she pulled her pants down for me .
i told you she' s a dyke .
we were talking about tattoos and she showed me .
wes has got a snake wrapped around a dagger on his shoulder .
your husband has a snake ?
am i the only one who doesn' t know what this is ?
it' s a symbol .
it' s egyptian .
for what ?
it means you' re a lesbian .
stop .
she says it symbolizes life .
i can' t believe they' re gonna give her one when there' s so many of us , with husbands , who want to adopt .
oh , come on .
a child needs a father .
i grew up without one .
i had four .
stepfathers .
my mother always said she hoped the next one would turn out better .
oh , lord .
i can' t look .
that oughta be a crime .
they look pretty happy .
they' re underfed , but happy .
makes me miss my puppies .
what are they ?
jack russells .
we raise about a dozen at a time .
my george can get them fed on schedule and give them their shots , but ... ... they need their mama .
i can show you how to swim if you want .
as if .
you are afraid ?
fish urinate in this stuff .
you think i' m gonna stick my face in it ?
you are here alone ?
with my posse .
with your mother .
i appreciate that .
you are a punk ?
that would be stretching it .
you are a beach boy ?
student .
and this is like a field trip ?
have you been to a disco here ?
we have a lot of club .
everybody on the beach can see that .
would you like to go with me to one ?
what' s your name ?
i' m reynaldo .
sorry , reynaldo .
i' ve got socks older than you are .
good run ?
terrific .
we' re just deciding whether leslie should have a kid or not .
do you wanna vote ?
whoever she gets , i hope they' ve got no sense of fashion .
i' m sure in new york she looks fine .
she' s what , a proofreader ?
editor ... fiction books .
she gave me one she worked on .
what was it like ?
kinda racy , lots of language .
language ?
curse words .
she' s gonna have to get an au pair .
can she afford that ?
she' s in publishing .
if she is a lesbian , she won' t have to worry .
they' il have it all organized .
mom ...
the one in 214 ...
don' t mess with the shower .
but she complained .
this woman ... changed rooms three times .
she' s done nothing but complain .
wait for herminio .
and clean your glasses .
we should take it apart and leave it a few days , see how she likes it .
great idea .
she' il be in my face , not yours .
wait for herminio .
if you' re going to watch this crap , you should get cable .
leave it alone .
i can fix it .
you ?
who' s done more damage with those pliers than with your molotov cocktails ?
i' d like to light ...
214 up .
listen , mister .
we don' t threaten our guests here .
understand ?
why do we have to kiss their imperialist asses ?
they' re our guests .
it' s how we make a living .
and if you don' t have a job , the judge sends you back to jail .
you and uncle ernesto , selling babies !
we provide a service .
a service ... for rich yankees who ...
would you be happier if the rich mothers came from here ?
parasites !
fat , corrupt ...
when i' m dead , you can invite your terrorist friends ... fleas and all , to live here for free .
but until that day , we provide food and lodging of high quality to those who can pay .
and clean those damn glasses !
she never got fatter , which is a miracle with the crap kids eat these days .
we had no idea of her condition .
do you know what month you' re in ?
maybe the second .
the third at the most .
they don' t tell us anything .
when i was a girl ...
have you considered an abortion ?
that' s not an option .
and raising it ?
she' s barely fifteen .
there are a lot of mothers who ...
not celia .
so what now ?
we bring it back here or give it up there ?
we' il arrange that later .
and celia ... what do you think ?
consuelo .
that' s your name for her , or theirs ?
that' s her name .
that she was given by ...
by her birth mother .
we plan to change ours to henley .
your husband' s name ?
so they' il call him junior ?
they' il call him henley , jr .
you know , they can' t say their j' s .
you making fun of me ?
no , really , it' s genetic .
leslie , don' t be mean .
it' il be , " my name is henley yunior .
which one do you like ?
you visiting here ?
si .
i don' t know what to buy .
thank you .
damn it !
you can' t use that if you can' t read .
it' s mine !
that' s really beautiful work .
i' d like something wider ... cover this up .
birthmark ?
it' s a burn .
ouch .
that' s how i learned what " hot " meant .
knocked over the steam iron ?
i was playing with the knobs on the stove , which my mother had told me not to do a million times , and she had a skillet in her hand , so she grabbed my wrist ...
god .
you don' t obey your mother , this is what happens .
that' s awful .
she never had to repeat herself to me again .
kids have to learn sometime .
well !
they saw you coming .
is herminio here ?
not yet .
i' il be in the bathroom .
water pressure , my ass .
you ladies are braver than i.
looks like hemingway' s rec room .
what' s " sea food " again ?
mariscos .
what' s the difference between grouper and snapper ?
is there one ?
i' il have a mojito with lime , not lemon .
they know how to make ' em .
i didn' t see any limes on the counter .
una cola ?
what did i say ?
that you wanted a tail .
i' m hopeless .
daiquiri , por favor .
agua ?
you didn' t order bottled .
it' s a restaurant .
it' s in the guidebook .
personally , i plan to get out of this country with my plumbing intact .
where' s miss congeniality ?
she' s off to run a marathon before lunch , work up an appetite .
she likes to keep fit .
and hitler liked a parade ... woman is obsessed .
what' s the name of that movie where all the housewives turn into perfect looking clones ?
her husband is gorgeous .
you met him ?
i saw a picture .
hiking in the rockies , glowing with health .
she' s very sweet .
she' s upbeat .
she' s been waiting here longer than the rest of us , and she' s still got a positive attitude .
i trust her as far as i can throw her .
that' s because you' re from new york .
that' s ' cause i' m from planet earth .
someday , one of her microchips is gonna misfire .
you' il see the real skipper .
she' il open her mouth , this thing with six heads will come out .
there have been plenty of nasty things to come out of your mouth .
thank you .
guess how many seafood places called " el pescadero " there are in this neighborhood .
we ordered you the bacon cheeseburger .
if it' s 2 : 30 here , then in virginia ...
it' s 2 : 30 .
it' s the same latitude .
longitude ?
i have to call henley .
poor thing .
yeah , house in newport , estate outside of d. c. , boat bigger than my apartment ?
they almost split up .
jennifer and henley , sr. ?
that' s not the best time to be adopting a child .
maybe we should rat her out to the agency .
maybe raising a child together will help their marriage .
my daddy always said that children were the glue that held a marriage together .
in my parents ' marriage , i was more like the hammer .
my mother used me to bang dents in my father .
if they really are on the verge of breakup ,
i would hope that whoever was providing the personal references ...
had the good sense to lie when necessary .
how can you say that ?
' cause if you' re clueless enough to ask somebody who' d slag you on an adoption reference , you deserve what you get .
the whole thing is such a game .
they' re just doing what they think is best .
for their bank accounts .
why do you think they' ve got us down here for so long ?
they' re gonna make us earn our babies .
it' s part of the balance of trades .
it' s not like that .
i' il bet you two pina coladas her henley will fly down here some weekend , make a donation to our lady of perpetual red tape , and they' il fly off with a little bundle of joy .
you sound so bitter .
i have been here over two months .
pregnant women wait nine .
yeah , but they get to throw up and develop varicose veins .
leaving sunday with a baby .
wouldn' t that be awesome ?
i called them yesterday and ... they said they' d let me know if anything ...
if you make yourself a nuisance , they stick you at the bottom of the pile .
well , you' re not here , henley .
i' m here .
no , i don' t think you should call the korean people .
this isn' t the commodities market , henley .
right .
right ... yeah .
i just miss you .
you know , there' s a lizard in my room .
no , a lizard , not a blizzard .
no , i said a lizard ,
like a chameleon , a gecko ...
a lizard .
yeah .
it makes this little noise at night , it' s nice .
okay .
i miss ...
hello ?
i didn' t say they don' t have papaya .
i said " papaya " is another word for " pussy .
pussy words ?
vaginal euphemism .
beaver , clam ...
nobody here ordered clams , did they ?
the lower on the food chain you eat , the better the nutritional value .
though the risk of toxicity increases .
thank you for sharing .
there is probably every disease known to man down here .
elephantitis , beri beri ...
the thing for all of us to worry about are the infant syndromes ,
like ... where the mother is intoxicated .
fas .
and drugs .
crack , all that .
they have crack here ?
then there' s the genes .
what do you do about genes ?
my point exactly .
you could adopt a ticking time bomb and never know it .
it' s the same with birth kids .
but birth kids , you know both parents .
you know family history .
in my family , sometimes people are born with six toes .
on one foot .
people assume that if they have kids , they' il inherit all their favorite qualities .
if you get dealt a weak hand , you can always train it out of them , but it' s work .
roll up a newspaper .
i' m serious .
if they are born with some kind of disability ... racial , cultural , whatever ... you make them aware .
they' ve got some catching up to do , and you stay on their case .
i think you just watch them and see who they are and encourage what' s best in them .
mine had better be calm .
the one neurotic per family rule .
appetizers .
skipper , any damage this is gonna do to my wellness ,
i don' t wanna hear about it .
can you read this ?
sure .
it' s about a goat .
will you read it to me ?
maybe later .
look !
look !
think we can sell it ?
did they use it ?
if they did , nothing came out .
what is it ?
if mom had had one of these , we wouldn' t be here .
they arrange it all .
we just sign the papers and hand over the baby .
her ?
mute like always .
i don' t think she understands how serious this is .
can i help you ?
i need to buy jeans a size bigger .
maybe two .
and this one ?
it' s cheaper , but it only pays if all the numbers come up .
and then ?
if you win , you' re king of the world .
i' il take just one .
no , gracias .
ladies , ladies , if you choose one of them , the others , they go away .
how much is it ?
whatever you think is reasonable is fine .
i don' t know , what is this , four dollars ?
that is very reasonable .
are you available ?
absolutely , yes .
always .
blanca' s learning to use a computer .
in school ?
they have that now ?
they' ve only got one .
the students take turns .
so if she wants to go to the moon ...
you need it for everything these days .
to clean rooms ?
the royal princess has a computer that says which rooms are ready and which need cleaning .
but the maids ?
the maids just clean .
we' re too old to learn that stuff .
want to walk to the beach if there' s time left ?
the waves scare me .
the waves ?
i can' t swim .
right , you' re a mountain girl .
i really think blanca' s going to graduate .
if some guy doesn' t nail her first .
we made a deal .
she graduates without getting pregnant , and i don' t wring her neck .
my sister used to threaten to sew me up .
it didn' t work .
you think the american mothers eat the same stuff we do ?
sure .
but they always want it cooked without lard .
are they jews ?
how long have you been a guide ?
i' m not , but if you' re with me , the others won' t be bothering you .
we appreciate it .
thank you .
your english is very good .
i wish that was true .
how did you learn it ?
at the movies .
we have a cinema here and the actors speak in english , and ... they ...
they write under .
the subtitles .
right .
it' s a very good school , believe me .
if you' re not a guide , what do you do ?
now it' s very difficult for us , for all the people here , and we have crisis .
we have economics crisis .
politics as well .
we have had some trouble .
you' re out of work ?
yes .
i was building houses and ...
office , schools ...
construction .
yes , but that ...
business is not so good now .
it' s a pity .
you girls ... are you here for your vacations ?
we' re adopting babies .
sure .
it' s our greatest exportation .
they' re gonna get hit on whether we' re with them or not .
maybe they' il meet some latin hunk .
they' re not looking .
it' s still good for the ego .
are you ... looking ?
for a guy ?
i figured i' ve given that enough time .
i better get this baby thing started before i' m too old .
it' s tough being a single mother .
but you' ve only got a fight on one front .
you think the kid should go to bed at 6 : 00 , there' s no big debate .
you' re getting a girl , right ?
rebecca .
what' s yours again ?
we haven' t decided yet .
i' m not gonna be one of these ones where there' s lots of choices about the basic stuff .
it' s gonna be , " here' s your breakfast .
eat it or go hungry .
she' s not gonna call me by my first name or have a cell phone by the time she' s 15 .
tough love .
i see these women in new york , it' s like their daughters are their best friend .
they go to the same hair salon , the same shrink ?
forget it .
i wanted more friends , i' d host a slumber party .
you think zorro hung out here ?
i' m not certain what you wish me to do .
your petition has been filed , the placement procedure is underway , so ?
we' re paying you .
i have to comply between both your wishes and the laws of my country .
so we do all the paperwork and you just pass it on ?
it may appear that way , but i can assure you that everything is ...
they said that we had to hire a local lawyer or it was no dice .
that' s one of the regulations , yes .
if you are unhappy , i can always recommend you another advocate , but to change at this point might prejudice your case .
so you' ve got us over a barrel ?
at this rate , the baby will be talking full sentences before i get it .
i don' t wanna have to undo all that .
undo ?
these are crucial months for learning !
i understand this .
what i want is for you to move our file from the bottom of whatever pile it' s on to the top !
sennora ...
if we receive our child by ... ... the end of this week , there will be some kind of bonus in it for you , on top of your usual fee .
the government doesn' t permit us to accept any kind ...
the government doesn' t have to know anything about this , do they ?
unless , of course , there' s someone that you have to pay off , and then you just let me know the amount , and i will make sure ...
i will pretend you never suggested this .
bonus or not , it' s still your job .
believe me , you don' t want my husband to have to come down here .
i will do my best effort , but i promise you nothing .
doesn' t speak spanlsh
it' s ernest .
hey , brother .
what' s up ?
the american ladies bugging you ?
i' m here with a client , a nancy hightower .
the one in 214 .
she' s a witch .
rubn and the rest of them want to poison her , but she' s paid up through monday .
two months , one week .
could you live with an early departure ?
it would make you happy ?
get her out of here !
the sooner , the better !
i understand perfectly .
what did the judge say about buho' s case ?
that my nephew is an enemy of the state .
tell him che is ancient history .
okay .
see you sunday .
i have made an inquiry .
i was right here .
what did they say ?
no promises have been given , but your paperwork is entering the final phase .
that' s what you said the last time i got you on the phone .
yes , but this is the final phase ... ... of the final phase .
i believe that your hopes will soon come to fruition .
i' m sorry , this is an inquiry from the ministry .
araceli will see you out .
so we have a deal .
if the lord is willing .
buenas tardes .
you must forgive us , madame .
but here we don' t accept american express for our children .
but there is a cash machine in the lobby .
ministry of human services , please , the director .
attorney buendia calling .
you' il never get one of our precious children ... even if you torture me to death .
gonzalo , how are you ?
buendia here .
listen , buddy , i' ve got a big favor to ask you .
i' m allowed to visit the kids ... but only if her sister is there in the room with us .
she doesn' t trust me one bit .
before , i would have flipped out .
but now ... now i try to think before i say anything stupid .
that' s all .
thank you , wilfredo .
and now , our visitor .
would you like to say something ?
i don' t know how many of y' all are gonna understand this , but my name is gayle , and i' m an alcoholic .
you figure they had a lot of hangings here ?
burnings at the stake , your basic inquisition type stuff .
they had the inquisition over here , too ?
sure .
it just happened a few years later .
kinda like the beatles coming to america .
are you religious ?
not really .
for the interview , i said i was ethical culture .
what' s that ?
if you' re jewish , it' s like the last resort ...
orthodox , reformed , unitarian , ethical culture .
gayle is heavy duty born again .
she' s not obnoxious about it , though .
she doesn' t , you know , proselytize .
oh , that' s how you say that .
as far as i know .
are you gonna send rebecca ...
are you gonna send her to public schools ?
sure , send her off with crayons and a flak vest .
i' m serious .
so am i.
she' s gonna have to bump up against the real world at some point .
this thing where they' re interviewing four year olds to get them into the right daycare , so they get into the right prep school , so they can get into yale early admissions ?
it costs a fortune , but it is your kid' s future .
i figure if she doesn' t absolutely despise me by the eighth grade ,
i' m ahead of the game .
at first the spaniards was inside these walls and our people was outside .
then the great general jose de san martin arrived with his army , and the spaniards were beaten .
thousands of people was losing their life .
i thought you weren' t a guide .
i was in school for some years .
this is our history .
i have brought my children here to show them .
how many children do you have ?
graciela , eugenio , y marisol .
are they in school ?
when it' s possible , yes .
may i ask you , which of the united states you are living in ?
d. c.
that' s where the white house is .
actually , it' s not a state , it' s a district .
also , we have a place in rhode island .
the smallest of them all .
i' m from colorado .
have you ever visited ?
no .
but i have a great desire to do this .
do you know this city of philadelphia ?
sure .
someday i would like to find a job there .
why in philadelphia ?
it' s the cradle of liberty .
i' il show you where a dangerous piracy was driven to the sea .
this way .
do you think he' d be insulted if i gave him more than four dollars ?
is my son good for anything ?
he' s still very young .
young ?
he' s past thirty .
age isn' t just years .
children are a curse .
i know .
we' ve got eight .
eight !
how do you support them ?
with great difficulty , ma' am .
his father gets mixed up in politics , goes into exile .
i thought all that was over .
first the government wanted to kill him , now i do .
living with a spanish girl who' s half his age , right ?
the man is totally shameless .
off playing the fool ... while i' m stuck with these ... whining mothers and all the bills to pay !
men get mixed up in politics like it' s no big deal .
then get the military pissed off .
and who' s left to order the linens ?
this is better on my table , but it' s too bulky to bring down .
i' m okay .
are you manipulating my aura ?
something like that .
you have to see where the hot spots are , where the energy polarizes .
that really deep stuff is sort of ...
don' t worry , i don' t do anything too intense .
i think i feel something .
there' s quite a knot in here .
something emotional .
do you do this on children ?
sometimes .
they get most of what they need from , you know , handling .
do you think that they can tell if it' s not their real mother that' s holding them ?
you' re gonna be the real mother .
if i were to breastfeed ...
the idea of letting someone else' s suck on me .
i guess i' m not that maternal .
you' re not a mother yet .
now visualize an emotional state and try to send it all to one specific part of your body .
like ?
why don' t we try anxiety ?
how' d you come up with that one ?
try to put it all here .
do you think henley' s too much of a load ?
as a name ?
names aren' t so important .
he' s just not gonna look anything like his father , and to have this whole " junior " thing laid on him ...
your husband must feel strongly about it .
well , we looked through a name book .
we both really liked joshua .
there' s way too many of those .
we had a joshua .
you had a little boy ?
the first one was gonna be cody if it was a girl , which it was .
i was young enough .
we didn' t ask for an amnio .
and you miscarried .
i' ve read that ... sometimes they end , and the mother didn' t even know she was pregnant .
this was in the last trimester .
oh , god .
that' s terrible .
they said she , they knew it was a she by then ,
she' s not gonna be viable .
you' il have to carry to term .
so you had ...
it was like a delivery , but without the same spirit .
nobody brings a video camera .
and with joshua ?
he was born with his lungs not properly formed , and with gabriel , it was his heart .
turn over .
there was another one ?
gabriel .
did they both ...
lived .
joshua lived about two days , and gabriel hung on for a whole week .
they were incredible .
you' re not drinking enough water .
what ?
your kidneys .
this tells me you' re not flushing well .
how ...
i can' t ...
how do you get past that ?
losing ... ... losing three babies .
imagine that you' re made of light and that you' re spreading outward into a black sky .
lie down .
excuse me .
with your permission .
no , come on in .
you can work around me .
i' m writing to relatives in ireland ... big family ?
me , too .
how many ?
how many ?
five brothers , four sisters .
there' s nine of us .
old fashioned catholic , i guess .
there were six of us .
three older brothers , but two are dead now .
and i take care of the little ones .
whoever this little girl is that i' m getting , my daughter , she' s got a roomful of cousins .
my daughter .
listen to me .
don' t think i' ve called her that before .
do you speak any english ?
it' s pretty weird , you know .
because you have no idea of who it is you' re getting , really .
but you can' t help have these ideas , these ... fantasies .
i have this day in my head .
and i used to daydream it even when i thought i could have my own kids .
it' s early winter ... ... and there' s snow .
we get some serious winters in boston .
you don' t have snow down here , do you ?
snow ?
a snowfall .
like the state , right ?
it' s a day when there' s no school .
it' s a snow day .
and i let her sleep late .
and she' s little , but she' s old enough to go to school .
she' s third grade , maybe .
and i let her sleep late .
i come in , and she' s this little , warm bump in the bed .
and i say , " darling , it' s a snow day .
i' m gonna let you sleep .
you enjoy it more if you know you' re getting extra , that usually you' d be up and brushing your teeth .
finally , she gets up and she comes out in her pajamas , and i make her cocoa with ... you know those little marshmallows on the top ?
and then we talk about what we' re gonna do that day .
and you can hear the snow shovels outside crunching .
the plows rumble by every once in a while , scraping the streets , and it' s still falling , so it stays clean on top of everything , white .
then i get her dressed ... all the layers .
although now it' s a lot less with the polar fleece .
and she can do most of it herself , but you help because it' s a pleasure .
her arm on your neck while she balances to put her boots on .
no thought of it .
you' re just an extension of her body .
we go to the common , or we go way out to jamaica pond , depending on the weather .
and she' s just bold enough to skid out away from me a little bit .
shaky , but she keeps looking back to see if i' m watching her .
she always comes back to lean on me and rest .
and there' s zillions of kids , and they' re all ages .
they' re zipping around and that makes her really excited , but mostly , she just wants to be with me .
just the two of us .
and then later , when i take her to shakey' s or ground round , whatever seems like a big treat to her , and i let her order french fries , as long as she has some of my soup , too , and she tells me stories about her classmates , or she tells me stories that she' s made up , or ...
... whatever .
we sit and we talk in the booth .
and we' re surrounded by other mothers and their kids .
and i am just one of them , you know ?
and then later ... ... when we walk home from wherever i can park the car ... ... there is the sound of our feet on the new snow ... ... her taking two steps to my one .
then maybe if they haven' t shoveled the walk , like they usually don' t ... ... i go in front , to break the way for her .
this is ignoring the fact that i am supposed to be at work , right ?
i' m the one with the job .
i have a little girl up north .
i named her esmeralda .
she' il be four years old on the ninth of april .
maybe she lives where it snows .
who knows ?
i was so young .
i had to take care of my brother and sister .
i had to work .
the nuns ... they came to see me .
they said that ... it would be best to give her up .
sometimes when a new group of mothers comes ,
i pick one .
a good one .
i try to ... imagine her face , her voice .
when i think of esmeralda with her other mother up there in the north ,
i hope that my little girl ... has found a mother like you .
i didn' t get any of it .
excuse me .
i' m sorry .
reynaldo .
celia .
what' s up ?
nothing much .
zoila said you were looking for me , with some big news .
zoila doesn' t know shit .
you still hanging at the beach ?
no , i' ve had ...
i' ve been sick .
better now ?
it' il be over soon .
great .
we' re going to miami .
who knows how long .
what do they have in miami we don' t have here ?
it' s ' cause my mother' s old fashioned and has to drag me everywhere .
you look different .
the boss .
see you around .
i don' t think so .
who' d you rob to get this ?
what' s it to you ?
there' s not enough left to buy doughnuts .
forget about it .
little shits .
i brought these .
they' il do .
a passport costs forty thousand ... with a birth certificate , too , it' s sixty thousand .
and the plane ticket ?
that depends .
toronto , chicago , new york , miami , it' s riskier but you get there .
if you want to fly to mexico and cross the border ...
and philadelphia ?
no direct flights to philadelphia .
is there a way i can pay half now and owe the rest ?
what do i look like ?
come back when you can pay .
one , two , three generations without a father ... or with one who' s unemployed or in jail .
children need role models .
they need a dream to follow .
instead we have this permanent despair , kids growing up with no concept of work or responsibility .
this is why i won' t go out on the streets alone after dark .
sure , there were excesses in the past , but when i was a girl , we had a sense of dignity .
now , this is more like it .
how many stars are next to this in the guidebook ?
we' il be fine as long as you don' t get into the wine list .
i' m treating .
come on .
no , i want to .
no ...
i don' t ... no .
one last drink and that' s it .
it' s ridiculous .
nobody here wants them .
and why not ?
because they' ve fucked us from every angle ... economically , psychologically , politically .
it' s more than just them .
another round , please !
imagine our lives if they just disappeared .
how come they need so many ?
can' t they breed their own ?
they' re too busy making money to procreate .
or maybe it' s their technology .
i don' t trust those microwaves .
it' s just another form of cultural imperialism .
we supply the raw material and they refine it .
you think they' d let us bring their kids here ?
lots of opportunity up there .
for whites only .
hector , my cuban friend , he was in panama when they kidnapped noriega .
too bad they didn' t kill him .
and he told me that the yankee invaders ... were from every race !
chinese , latinos , blacks , whites .
exactly my point .
that' s where i' m heading !
that' s what i' m saying , too !
if it comes to a showdown ... the little bastards shooting at us will be our own .
an order of cheese empanadas for two ... chicken soup ... roast pork with rice .
and two margaritas .
les .
i' m sorry , i forgot .
i' m sorry .
make that one margarita and one pina colada without rum .
without rum .
twenty minutes .
i' il start timing them in half an hour .
no big hurry .
do you think the others think we' re being anti social ?
there' s no rule that says we have to do everything in a group .
of course , if the dog lady and miss triathlon weren' t here ...
skipper is a good person .
you cut people a lot of slack .
it' s just her ... ... her exterior is a bit intimidating .
did you order the cheese thingies , the turnovers ?
but of course .
i eat any more cheese , i might never poop again .
i got the opposite problem .
still ?
i know the location of every flush toilet in south america .
their stuff is worse than our stuff .
i just wish i could speak it like you do .
you don' t need to understand the words to watch tv .
stupidity is the universal language .
she was a communications major ...
nan .
that' s news .
at kansas state .
she told me she went to the university of missouri , majored in political science .
what did she tell you her husband does for a living ?
engineer .
high school chemistry teacher .
you' re kidding .
they get through a year with my george , they know that periodic table backwards and forwards .
wow .
if i tell you something , you promise not to pass it on ?
only if it' s really juicy .
she steals .
steals what ?
off the maids ' carts .
i' ve seen her take a half dozen of those shampoos , soaps , those little mints they put on our pillow at night .
you' re shitting me .
she just fills her pockets with them .
i suppose she assumes it' s her right .
it' s ... furtive .
furtive .
i love it .
i was halfway down in the stairs , so she didn' t know i saw her , but she just looked both ways , and she just dug right in .
and everything is so cheap down here .
she always seems so in control .
most of your serial killers are totally methodical .
come on .
i know you guys aren' t supposed to dis anybody , but you gotta admit , she' s a sociopath .
is that anything like a psychopath ?
with a lower body count , yeah .
then why are we letting her have a child ?
you have to know how to handle these people .
they' ve got an inferiority complex .
lord knows they have reason to have one , but you have to know what' s bark and what' s bite .
you don' t think every one of us couldn' t have finished our business and been long gone by now ?
they just wanna hold your feet to the fire a little , make the gringos squirm .
that' s exactly how i felt when they were doing all that fertility testing .
like they were making up new stuff just to try on me .
i had two operations .
one was a tubal ligation and this other thing .
i never totally understood the point .
nothing , right ?
it must work for somebody .
it works for the doctors .
you don' t wanna know what those bastards put me through .
they had me on this stuff with nun' s pee in it .
is this a regular doctor ?
italian nun' s pee ?
it has some kind of a hormone ?
from women of a certain age who haven' t been sexually active .
i' ve read about it .
it' s a racket .
they tried to talk my george into some business with his gonads .
i thought he was going to choke the intern .
here we go .
london broil , baked potato .
i think we scored , ladies .
we could say something .
to who ?
to the people at the agency down here .
that would go down real well .
in light of the persistent and malicious disappearance of our pillow mints , we the undersigned ...
so what do we do ?
i don' t know .
be really good mothers to ours .
pray for rosemary' s baby .
this is serious .
i know .
it' s life , though .
do you know how many manuscripts we get submitted every year where the basic story is the mom' s a fruitcake ?
it' s a whole genre .
so , we' re what , afraid to rock the boat , get the ministry riled up , throw a little hitch into that adoption schedule ?
we just don' t like her , that' s all .
the kid , whoever it is , will survive .
where we gonna sleep tonight ?
don' t worry about that .
put it here .
gold is the best .
gold and silver .
none for me ?
maybe a little bit .
later .
crabs and goats ... very soon you may realize your forgotten dreams .
and for our twins . it' s best to lay low ...
tonight you can be the big winner in the national lottery ...
here' s lady luck herself ...
miss esperanza natividad .
virgo never needs to say she' s sorry .
scorpions will enter a period of stress ... especially if they try to rise to a higher level .
lions ... should never live with fish .
remember that the race goes not always to the swiftest ... and that youth is the land of the possibility .
the road of knowledge ... is blocked by the prejudice of the smug .
and to follow the crowd is to lose your way .
aquarians ... it' s time for reflection ... to learn the lessons of the past and apply them to the future .
on the other hand .
libra ... expect a change that will turn your life upside down .
i see irreversible events ... grave warnings in the movement of the planets .
we must obseve their orbits with caution .
there are forces in life we can neither explain nor control .
our fotune is not accidental ... but a confluence of energy . negative or positive .
great days are coming !
you have unlimited potential .
we must remember ... that life offers as many oppotunities as there are stars in the sky .
the heavens don' t determine our destiny . but if we listen carefully to their signals .
we can smile at tomorrow !
hey , look , buy this from me .
look , i' m selling , i' m selling ... a book , please .
it' s about a goat .
look , i' m selling a book .
it' s really interesting , about a goat .
sir , i' m selling a book .
please , sir .
it' s really cheap !
eileen mulroney .
i got here as soon as i could .
the traffic was ...
have a seat , please .
you , too ?
looks like it .
that' s great .
congratulations .
likewise .
i left mine at the hotel .
be my guest .
thanks .
it was so sudden .
i had a pretty good idea .
you did ?
i lit a fire under my lawyer yesterday .
spread some money around .
really ?
got their attention .
put in a good word for you , too .
thank you .
in two minutes , my life will never be the same .
her name' s going to be esmeralda .
did i tell you that ?
who knows what lies ahead for you ?
maybe a wonderful life .
ready .
good luck , my love .
