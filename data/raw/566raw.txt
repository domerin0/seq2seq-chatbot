ahh , the famous genovian pear and cheese dessert .
what else ?
ooh .
woman : ... to our country .
you are nothing but an overdressed , drunken
i' m outta here !
oof !
aah !
oh !
i am sopping !
was that my fault ?
ha ha ha ha !
shall we adjourn to the grand hall for coffee ?
sorry i let you down , dad .
good night , louie .
this place was such a mess when i first arrived .
i' ve been spending every spare moment in it i can .
pick up one of these .
make yourself useful .
spray everything .
you' re not mad at me for what happened ?
actually , i found it rather funny .
reminds me of my first royal dinner party .
i accidentally knocked over a suit of armor ... and the spear went right through the suckling pig .
amelia , why don' t we cancel lessons for today ... and just have some fun ?
fun ?
you' re not too busy for something like that ?
your majesty , lady jerome has arrived ... and i have the french consulate' s assistant on hold .
he wants to confirm tonight' s dinner .
send my apologies .
cancel everything for today .
i' m being shown san francisco ... by a true san franciscan .
tell joseph i' il need the car .
yes , ma' am .
oh , wait !
i want to show you my baby .
it' s a she thing and it' s all in me
i can be anything that i want to be
don' t consider me a minority
ladies , help me out ...
i haven' t sat in the front seat of a car ... in the longest time .
by the way ... thanks for the money for my car , grandma .
so , where are you taking me ?
well , do you have any change ?
it' s not appropriate for royalty to jingle .
ok .
i' il get the change .
this one' s my favorite !
you put the quarter in and grab his hand .
i touch that ?
yes , you touch that .
and then you press the button ... and , uh ...
and then you just go .
looks like rupert' s cousin ... from liechtenstein .
how do i know when it' s ready ?
oh , it' il just go .
there you go !
go , go , go !
ow !
you enjoy this humiliation ?
well , it' s hard the first time ... but you can do it again .
hold this .
oh , come on !
you can do it , grandma !
i' m ready for you this time !
ready ?
go !
it' s going !
it' s going !
go , go , go , go , go !
you' re doing it !
you' re doing it !
go !
oh , yes !
hah !
ho !
got it !
give me five !
five ?
five .
oh !
oh !
i want one of these !
just not this one .
so ... did my father always want to be a prince ?
oh , yes .
except once , about 15 years ago ... he seriously considered renouncing his title ... because he met a lovely artist ... who showed him wonderful things ... about how life could be ... how he could be .
but ?
but he had a decision to make ... and nobody could make it for him .
not i though many people thought i did or anybody else .
phillipe knew that my firstborn ... his brother pierre , wanted to abdicate ... which he did , eventually , to join the church .
your father realized ... that the love he could have for one person or even two could not make him forget the love ... he felt for his country and its people .
it was the hardest thing he ever had to do .
um ... oh ...
do you want a bite of this ?
why not ?
well , here goes .
why , it' s delicious !
really ?
mm hmm .
oh , ok !
let' s get another one !
it' s the fastest way back to the consulate ... but i hate this hill !
i do believe i' m beginning to feel that corn dog .
uhh !
eh !
ah !
maybe you can just sneak gently through ?
ok , i' il try .
good .
right .
now , blaze on up .
i i got it !
you' ve got it .
i got it !
you' ve got it !
uhh !
oh !
i haven' t got it !
uh oh !
mia !
brake !
brake !
look out !
down here !
aah !
oh !
oh !
9 1 1 , i need to report an accident .
you didn' t hear the bell ? !
they put me on hold .
oh , for the love of god !
put down destruction of public property .
i will , i will .
and last , but not least ... driving without a license .
accompanied by an adult whose license expired ... 45 years ago .
i' ve been trying to tell you , officer .
licenses don' t expire in genovia .
not for the queen .
don' t i have diplomatic immunity ?
you do , but her we have to take downtown .
what ?
i' m sorry , miss .
it' s all right , officer .
i understand .
i ...
i understand perfectly .
you do ?
mia , no town , no city , no country ... can function peacefully ... if its officers and its transportation engineers ... don' t follow the letter of the law .
why , i would be proud ... to have two such fine , honorable gentlemen ... serving in genovia .
aw , shucks , ma' am .
ma' am , we' re not all that .
oh , but you most certainly are .
as a matter of fact ...
i would like to bestow upon you ... the honor of the ...
genovian order of the ... uh ... genovian order of the rose .
oh oh !
ooh !
ooh !
ooh !
oh .
would you please kneel ?
um ... does anybody have a sabre ?
oh !
i' ve got an umbrella !
i have an emergency brake .
this will do fine , thank you .
with the power vested in me ... by the royal crown of genovia ...
i dub thee
artie washington , san francisco , ma' am .
arthur washington .
and i dub thee
bruce macintosh of san leandro .
bruce macintosh ... masters of the order of the rose .
and all of you bear witness ... to this auspicious moment in history .
please rise .
wait till i go home and tell bernice .
now , mia , i know you don' t want to go ... all the way downtown , but
that really won' t be necessary .
no one got hurt , did they ?
we' re insured .
ok .
chivalry ain' t dead , you know , so
noble arthur , how very kind .
do you need a lift home ?
oh , that would be very helpful , thank you .
come along , mia .
good bye , trolley people !
please take the car to doctor motors ?
good bye !
so long !
good bye !
good bye .
you were awesome !
you are the coolest queen ever !
all in a day' s work .
wave good bye !
that' s a queen !
would you like to slide in first ?
i never slide .
good bye .
thank you .

mia ... the coast is clear .

the princess has left the building .
who have we got ?
what' s your name ?
where do you go to school ?
josh bryant .
i go to grove high school .
what are we , friends with mia now ?
yes .
we hate josh .
sorry .
it' s hard to keep up with who we' re not talking to .
here she comes !
mia !
i' m really sorry .
i can' t talk .
i have to go get my clothes .
well , here .
we' ve got your clothes .
you' il be a lot warmer .
you guys want to help me ?
yeah .
josh is such an idiot .
we' il make sure no one bothers you .
thank you .
um ...
that' s really nice of you .
this is so great of you .
thank you so much .
everything' s fine .
is anybody coming ?
no !
no !
guys , i really appreciate this .
thank you .
she' s got her bathing suit off .
ok , now !
princess , hi !
aah !
that was the scream of princess mia .
go away , all of you , please !
ok .
come here , mia .
piranhas , all of you !
back off !
my mom always told me i couldn' t cry ... and told me to be a big girl ... but you' ve been hurt , so you just cry .
it was really bad .
my foot didn' t even pop .
it was just last night ... that san francisco' s own little princess ... partied at the beach ... but what started out as innocent fun ... soon turned into allegedly too much fun .
this is suki sanchez for kpfw .
please say something .
well , there' s not much to say .
a picture' s worth a thousand words ... and you have two pictures .
i embarrassed the family , didn' t i ?
not to put too fine a point on it , yes , you did .
i think you' re making a wise decision ... to abstain from the job .
i suppose i won' t come to the ball .
of course you should come .
you' re still family .
just because you don' t want to be our princess ... doesn' t mean we' re sending you into exile .
your mother' s planning to come .
all your guests are invited .
except for your beach friends .
now , if you' il excuse me ...
i' m meeting with the press to do some damage control .
you can come in now .
if i may say so ... that did not go very well .
is this the way a princess should act ?
my information tells me that boy was using her .
the kiss was merely a device ... so that he could get his 15 minutes of fame .
and her friends didn' t help , either .
anna , falana , banana , bandana , montana ...
i have no idea what you' re talking about .
why didn' t she have enough common sense ... to deal with this ?
she' s only 15 ... but today , she acted beyond her years .
she showed great respect ... and gracefully accepted your criticism .
you' re saying that as a queen , i was too harsh on her .
i was critical of the person ... who could become the next ruler of my country .
no .
i' m saying , as a grandmother ... you might have been too harsh on your granddaughter .
do you think she can do it ?
oh , i have no doubts , ma' am .
i thought so , too .
what makes you different
makes you beautiful
what' s there inside you
shines through to me
in your eyes i see
all the love i' il ever need
hey , it' s mia thermopolips .
can you autograph your picture ?
josh did .
hey , there' s princess pucker up .
what makes you different makes you beautiful
what' s there inside you
shines through to me
in your eyes i see
all the love i' il ever need
lilly ?
hey , can i talk to you for a minute , please ?
lilly , can i just talk to you for a minute ?
is that cool ?
sure .
let' s talk .
but about what , hmm ?
how you broke my brother' s heart ... or how you stuck me with jeremiah ... during my cable show doing ...
pick a card , pick a card .
mwah mwah mwah !
i' m sorry , ok ?
i forgot to call you and tell you ... that i couldn' t make it .
so i was stuck with the happy houdini ... while you make out with the yachting yahoo .
those are really good alliterations .
no !
i don' t want to talk about alliterations !
lilly , i came up here to tell you that i' m sorry !
i' m sorry i missed your cable show ... and i' m just really sorry .
i can' t believe that you hung me up ... after all i did for you .
i kept your royal secret .
and do you know how hard it is ... to have a cable show and keep a secret ?
you didn' t keep it a secret from me ... how jerky you thought my being a princess was .
well , congratulations .
you got your wish .
i' m not gonna be a princess .
you' re not ?
no .
but i want you to be .
what ?
i didn' t mean it .
the green monster of jealousy came out ... because you were miss popular ... and i thought i was losing my best friend ... so i got angry and upset and hurt and ...
i told you !
i need an attitude adjustment .
but the truth is ... you being a princess is kind of a miracle .
whoa !
no !
what miracle ?
it' s a nightmare !
no !
think about it !
i just found out that my cable show ... only reaches 12 people .
wanting to rock the world , but having zip power like me now , that' s a nightmare .
but you wow !
i mean ...
what is so " wow " ?
wow is having the power to affect change ... make people listen .
how many teenagers have that power ?
what more of a miracle do you want ?
well ... we' il just have to find a different miracle .
not more , just different .
listen ... tomorrow night ... is the genovian independence day ball ... and to make up for my missing your cable show ...
i' m inviting you .
i hope you' il forgive me ... and i hope you come .
but what will i wear ?
mmm !
yay !
i don' t know , but it doesn' t really matter .
i' m just happy that you' re gonna come !
thanks .
and you can be a princess .
no , i can' t .
yes , you can .
yes , you can .
no , i can' t .
let' s move it in .
move in !
let' s go !
bobby bad , hang up the phone !
yes , mom .
i' il go to the dentist after school .
i hate it when they move in like that .
mia , it' s not a championship game .
it' s not even a big game .
it' s just gym class .
just hit the ball .
i don' t want to flunk you in gym class .
come on .
you can do it .
keep your eye on the ball .
that' s all right !
that' s ok !

jeremiah and mia .
oh !
miah and mia !

my friends and i were wondering .
the sweater you' re wearing was it designed for you ... or did the knitting machine just blow up ?
sunglasses , girls .
it' s jeremiah hair glare .
is one of your magic tricks your hair ?
ha ha !
hey , lana ?
huh ?
that is such a cute cheerleading outfit .
it' s so clean cut .
i bet it goes with anything .
of course it does !
aah !

it' s a present for your sixteenth birthday ... from your father .
it was found among his possessions .
my birthday' s not for two weeks .
i know ... but i wanted you to have it before we leave .
i return to genovia the day after tomorrow .
thank you .
it' s locked .
if you open the locket i gave you ... it becomes the key .
thank you for bringing it down here .
i also came to apologize ... for the way i spoke to you about the beach incident .
it was judge mental of me .
i didn' t pause to verify the facts .
that' s all right , grandma .
i' ve been thinking about it a great deal ... and the truth is ...
i think you' d make a very fine princess .
you know , people think ... princesses are supposed to wear tiaras ... marry the prince , always look pretty ... and live happily ever after ... but it' s so much more than that .
it' s a real job .
you are an extraordinary person , grandma ... but i don' t think i' m meant to do this .
i would be so afraid ... that i would disappoint the people of genovia ... and i couldn' t bear ... to disappoint you again .
well , as i said ...
i have faith in you .
i' m a writer .
ah !
i write soaps soap opera .
mm hmm .
did you ever see " middle house road " ?
no .
no , no .
it' s a big hit .
i wrote a character just like you once .
he was a spy .
i' m not a spy .
that' s what the character said .
i' il see you tonight , then .
mm hmm .
hahh !
i do have one favor to ask .
i need you to formally renounce your title ... for the press at the ball , you know ?
make a speech ?
mm hmm .
do you think that maybe ... considering my history with the press ... it would be better if you did it ?
amelia , you wouldn' t stop driving your mustang ... just because a couple of insects hit the windshield ?
besides , look how far you' ve come ... and i' il be right there with you .
i' il have joseph pick you up at 7 : 00 .
no .
um ...
i promised i' d let my mom drive me .
she wants to drive me to my first ball ... or something .
all right .
i' il see you there , then .
mm hmm .
grandma ?
i am sorry .
oh , my dear .
you are first and foremost my granddaughter .
ah !
please don' t be late .
hold on , but don' t hold too tight
let go and soon it' il be all right
don' t run away from what your heart is saying
no
be strong and face what you' re afraid of
come on , show ' em what you' re made of
i know it' s hard when your hope is gone
but you gotta keep holding on
hold on
you' re gonna make it
you gotta be strong now
thank you , dad , but i can' t be a princess .
i don' t make speeches ... and i' m not clarisse renaldi and ... and i just ...
i can' t do it , ok ?
i' m scared .
joseph .
charlotte , miss kawa .
nice to meet you .
pardon me .
i have to get the band ready .
of course .
should you be going to get princess mia ?
mia told clarisse her mother would be bringing her .
helen just arrived and said mia was waiting for you .
she' s going to run .
come on , fat louie .
time to pack .
let' s get your things .
louie , what have you got there ?
come on , louie .
we' re going on a trip .
we' re going to colorado ... where we can climb some real rocks .
we are so out of here , louie .
my dearest daughter ...
today is your sixteenth birthday .
congratulations .
i present you with this diary ...
to fill the pages with your special thoughts
special thoughts of your wonderful life .
it is a custom in my family ...
to pass on a piece of wisdom when one reaches this age .
i pass it on to you as my father passed it on to me .
amelia , courage is not the absence of fear ...
but rather the judgement ...
that something else is more important than fear .
the brave may not live forever ...
but the cautious do not live at all .
from now on , you' il be traveling the road ...
between who you think you are ...
and who you can be .
the key is to allow yourself to make the journey .
i also want you to know ...

and still think of her often .
happy birthday , my mia .
all my love , your father .
and there' s countess puck of austria ... as the glamorous continue to arrive ... at the genovian independence ball .

the future of genovia ... is in the hands of young mia thermopolis .
her decision tonight will affect the queen , the court ... and all the people of this small but proud country .

and that' s enough pear juggling .
the trip is off , louie .

there' s no answer at princess mia' s house ... and i couldn' t get joseph on the cell phone .
there' s too much static from the storm .
the press is starting to complain ... about making their deadlines .
if she' s not here in 10 minutes , i' il make the announcement .
yes , ma' am .
it' s ok .
she' il be fine .
she' s gonna get here .
is this punishment for driving without ... a licensed driver in the front seat ? !
i am invisible and i am wet .
the press was wondering if it would be possible
no .
no interviews until later in the evening .
yes , ma' am .
and we' re meeting baroness and baron von troken .
is it true if the teenager refuses the princess ship ... your family will take over the country of genovia ?
yes .
they must have a legitimate ...
renaldi blood relative or we rule .
no , ma' am .
then it' s time .
catch a falling star
and put it in your pocket
never let it fade away [ sobs ]
you wouldn' t happen to be running away , would you ?
what ?
dressed like this ?
no .
i' m going to a ball .
good .
get in .
her majesty , the queen .
my fellow genovians and honored guests ... good evening .
i apologize for the delay and oh , hello
and may i say ... welcome to our grand genovian independence day ball .
there' s no time to change .
you look fine .
pretty and fine .
just fine .
oh !
no running .
please , no running .
good .
it' s nice . ... a very special moment .
thank you so much for your patience .
i have an announcement to make .
my granddaughter  ahem .
she' s here !
i see .
i would like to announce that my granddaughter has arrived .
with a fascinating explanation as to her wardrobe , i' m sure .
she' s styling a wet , sort of grunge look hairdo ... and is wearing a sweatshirt , jeans , and docs .
mia , would you care to say a few words ?
um , yes .
why didn' t we dress like her ?
we look like idiots .
thank you , your majesty .
do you think they' re trying to save money on the gown ?
hi er , uh , hello .
i' m mia .
um ...
it stopped raining .
get your tiara ready .
i' m really no good at speech making .
normally i get so nervous that i faint ... or run away or sometimes i even get sick .
but you really didn' t need to know that .
but i' m not so afraid anymore .
my father helped me .
earlier this evening , i had every intention ... of giving up my claim to the throne ... and my mother helped me by telling me that it was ok ... and by supporting me like she has for my entire life .
but ... then i wondered how i' d feel ... after abdicating my role as princess of genovia .
would i feel relieved or would i feel sad ?
and then i realized ... how many stupid times a day i use the word " l .
in fact , probably all i ever do ... is think about myself .
and how lame is that ... when there are 7 billion other people on the planet
ahem .
ooh .
sorry .
i' m going too fast .
but then i thought ... if i cared about the other 7 billion out there ... instead of just me ... that' s probably a much better use of my time .
see , if i were princess of genovia ... then my thoughts ... and the thoughts of people smarter than me ... would be much better heard and just maybe ... those thoughts could be turned into actions .
so this morning when i woke up ...
i was mia thermopolis .
but now ...
i choose to be forevermore ...
amelia mignonette thermopolis renaldi ...
princess of genovia .
i hope you didn' t order your stationery yet .
this was my very first tiara .
i was rather fond of it .
i' m hoping you will be , too .
oh .
grandma , but you had it already .
how did you know i' d even be here ?
because i recognize the same spirit in you ... as someone else i know .
who ?
me .
ah , you made it .
you bet your life , you big , tall string bean .
here .
paolo here to save the day .
genovia
the land i call my home
genovia , genovia
forever will your banner wave
her majesty , queen clarisse ... and her royal highness , amelia , princess of genovia .
i think perhaps we' d better get you dried off now .
thank you .
no longer does mia stand for " missing in action .
genovia has a new princess .
they had the same idea i had ... but now the garden is " occupado .
why me ?
because you saw me when i was invisible .
and just because i' m royal ... doesn' t mean i' m any different .
come on , i' m really the same person .
yes , i will have to live in genovia ... but i' il still go to school and ...
you showed me faith is not gone
i don' t need wind to help me fly
miracles happen once in a while
when you believe
you showed me dreams come to life
that taking a chance on us was right
all things will come with a little time
when you believe
dear diary ... today is my first official day as princess of genovia .
we' il land in a few hours ... and i' il meet the parliament and the people ... before beginning my royal duties .
mom is , of course , moving to genovia with me ... and will continue painting without the balloons .
lilly and michael are spending their summer vacation ... at our can you believe it palace .
they' re even having my mustang brought over ... which i can legally drive in two weeks .
grandma' s so glad to be going home .
and joseph ?
well , he' s watching nearby as usual .
everybody' s got pre coronation jitters ... including me .
everybody , that is , except fat louie .
he' s totally adapted to being a royal .
i guess he was one all along .
princess , look out the window ... and welcome to genovia .
miracles happen once in a while
when you believe
you showed me dreams come to life
that taking a chance on us was right
all things will come with a little time
when you believe
i know sometimes you feel
like you don' t fit in
and this world doesn' t know
what you have within
when i look at you
i see something rare
a rose that can go anywhere
and there' s no one i know that can compare
what makes you different
makes you beautiful
what' s there inside you
shines through to me
in your eyes i see
all the love i' il ever need
all i need of love
what makes you different
makes you beautiful to me
so beautiful
what makes you
what makes you different
makes you beautiful
to me
everything you do is beautiful
love is shining right through me
everything in you is beautiful
beautiful
to me
to me
ooh
mm mmm
mm hmm
i know that you' re searching for answers
afraid that you' il be left behind
but you can' t rush time
you got to wait in line
in time , the answers you' il find
you' il get your wings at the right time
each of us must learn how to fly
gotta move on from what' s breaking your heart
don' t let your life pass you by
