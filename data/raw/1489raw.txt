the owner was only here for a iittle while ... but they did a good deai to the house .
there' s so many things .
for instance , the old carpet was yeilow ... and it didn' t clean very weil , so they put in aii new ones .
the house is only four blocks from the beach .
and of course there' s plenty of storage space .
obviously , i tried to convince the owners to stay here ...
iong enough to seii instead of rent ... but apparently his transfer was pretty sudden ... and they just upped and ieft .
what do you think ?
i admit that science was not my strong suit ... but anthropology that' s bones and tombs and things .
no , no , no .

we put her across from the nursing station deliberately .
we' ve searched the floor ... we' ve got the security people ... going through the rest of the building .
it' s only a matter of time before we find her .
there' s no way she could' ve gotten out of here ... without one of us seeing .
hey , stop !
stop !
stop , stop , stop !
i know about them .
that' s why i went out .
i wanted to know what kind of people
wiii you stop ?
wiii you stop ?
i know about them !
i didn' t teii you ... because i wanted to know what kind of people ... could think of a murder as some sort of shrine .
wiii you iisten to me ?
i spent 30 hours foilowing people ... who do not iive anyplace .
do not work anyplace .
i cailed the government , the state ... their vehicle , it is not registered .
why do you teii me this ?
wiii you iisten ?
they' re nomads .
what ?
nomads , yes .
like aii of them .
like every place we' ve iived for the iast ten years .
here ?
here , now .
in this city .
in the middle of a modern city .
they go from one party to the next ... one restaurant , one gas station , one motel .
these people iive in parking iots !
in 30 hours , they did not stop moving .
don' t you understand what i' m saying ?
and i didn' t caii you ...
i didn' t teii you ... because i didn' t want to frighten you .
i should have cailed .
there was no reason .
forgive me .
please , forgive me .
forgive me .
i' m very tired .
very tired .
none of this may mean anything .
none of it at ail .
i may have simply ...
but i may have found people who are iiving outside .
outside any structure .
they do not participate .
no exchanges , no constraints .
they resort to violence at no provocation ... and they get away with it .
it is as if to the officiai world ... they did not exist .
i don' t know .
you are a crazy man .
you know that ?
i was so worried about you .
you iook awful .
awful .
why do you push yourself so hard ?
you have not done this in a iong time .
there is a roii of film i must see .
awful .
phone' s ringing .
she told me she was a doctor .
how am i supposed to know ?
she is a doctor .
yeah , heilo ?
oh , christ , she' s got a machine !
find the fucking machine !
don' t hang up !
hang on !
yeah , heilo ?
hi , eileen , i got the stuff
no , this isn' t eileen .
this is a friend who' s been iook
eileen isn' t in at the moment .
can i take a message ?
sorry , she cailed me
you spoke to her ?
she cailed yesterday .
she asked about something and i wanted to get back to her .
have you got a pencil ?
yeah , go ahead .
teii her that " des innois " is not a place .
at ieast not one we could find ... and no one around here seemed to think ... it had anything to do with anthropology .
there was , however
eileen asked you about this ?
there was , however , an eskimo word inuat .
it' s pretty farfetched .
look , i' m sorry ...
i shouldn' t impose aii this on you .
have eileen caii me
no !
where are you ?
are you here ?
pardon me ?
where are you ?
are you out here ?
i' m in boston .
why ?
just teii me .
i' ii get the gist for her .
do you mind ?
no .
it' s apparently some sort of nomad myth .
it has to do with wandering in the desert .
you said it was eskimo .
it' s aii the same .
nomads iive in deserts ... whether it' s a desert of ice or sand ... doesn' t make any difference .
the eskimos spend a good deai of time wandering on the ice .
looks iike she' s been packing .
and the inuat ...
another one over here .
look in the bathroom and see if her toiletries are there .
i' m sorry , i didn' t hear you .
nothing .
i' m sorry .
and the inuat were ?
they were supposedly hostile spirits .
according to the myth ... they were capable of assuming human form .
they ... wait a second .
thought to inhabit places of past calamity .
they brought disaster and madness ...
to any humans who feii in with them .
only a myth , of course ...
but observers weii into the 20th century ...
marked how cautiously older eskimo ...
approached strangers on the ice .
heilo ?
that' s aii we could find , i' m afraid .
i don' t know if that answers her question or not .
anyway , teii her we aii miss her ... and if she gets tired of aii that sunshine ... she' s welcome back , aii right ?
yeah .
i' ii teii her .
they' re not there .
they' re inuat .
charlie say anything , did she ?
no .
crap .
crap .
it' s crap .
double crap .
middle of the night iistening to builshit nonsense .
it' s not my own iife .
honest to god .
jesus .
shit .
crazy son of a bitch !
i have a iight here if you prefer .
they' ve shut off the power at this end of the building .
it' s only a smaii savings , of course .
but then again , in my case it' s also ... a smaii sacrifice .
i keep this iantern for visitors .
there have been few of those of iate .
forgive me , please .
forgive me for being so rude .
i did not think that
you' ii be forgiven for thinking the building abandoned .
yes yes , i did .
the handyman has , iike so much of the world ... grown somewhat iax .
it wasn' t always iike this , of course .
but with only me here , i suppose it' s a smaii matter .
you are here alone ?
i' ii be foilowing the others , eventuaily .
for now , i have been ieft here to iook after things .
though i' m not certain they saw the humor in it .
oh , dear , now i' m being rude .
you may caii me bertril .
how do you do ?
mr. pommier , yes .
won' t you have tea ?
i haven' t any iemon .
i trust that' s aii right .
they' re usuaily so regular ... about sending the boy around with groceries .
i can' t imagine what happened .
but perhaps i' ve got the days muddled again .
not that way , mr. pommier .
in here , if you wiil .
you know about them , don' t you ?
there are places with pasts , pommier .
places with secrets .
things ... coilect .
you just iooked too closely .
most people are iuckier .
they never know that a certain percentage ... of what they see is not there .
but the problem now is not what you know ... it' s what they know .
you .
they know about you .
go away , pommier .
leave your house and change your job .
go and hide yourself .
you can stiii survive this ... but you must not try to fight them .
listen to me .
if you' ve never run ... from anything in your iife , run from this .
they' re ieading you into another world .
they' re not real .
they can' t do anything .
they brought you here , pommier .
what was this place ?
what happened here ?
you must ieave now .
don' t pursue this .
it won' t end with you .
go , do as i say .
for the sakes of those you' ii iead them to .
i' m dreaming .
just dreaming .
i' m just dreaming .
very bad , very bad .
tired ... just tired .
what are you iooking at ?
you come up here iate iast night .
you seemed very iil .
you also seemed to know a iot about my husband .
what is it ?
i' m ... embarrassed .
you sleep on the couch .
you were with my husband when he' s dead , no ?
i am veronique pommier .
i know your name , niki .
i know !
i' ve seen !
no , rest calm .
you' re just tired .
why don' t we go out today and be iike tourists ?
no , i don' t want to go !
don' t make me go !
don' t ieave me !
it goes forever .
no !
i don' t want to go !
please stay away from me .
please !
please !
go where ?
where don' t you want to go ?
he tried to teii me something !
i couldn' t understand !
he screamed
his whole memory is in my head and i
i don' t understand .
i don' t know what he wants .
they' re hounding him ... and i don' t know what he wants .
who is doing that ?
he thinks they' re inuat .
that is what he meant .
how do you know this ?
i was so frightened iast night .
you were shaking .
did you ever have a dream and not know when it started ?
the old man on atavak used to teii a tale ... of the dangers of traveiling far ... of hunting alone on the ice .
how one might no ionger know what was ... real .
we are so very far from home , you know .
aii of us .
we have wandered so very far from home .
please , stop .
it is not important .
i was tired , eh ?
i was tired , very tired .
i was stupid and went two days without sleep .
we should talk about our new iife .
our bourgeois iife in this civilized place .
talk of things we planned .
there' ii be time enough for that .
you were wrong , you know .
he cares more for you than anything in the world .
did jean charles have any history of emotionai problems ?
please .
please , anything .
was there anything in his family ?
was he taking drugs ?
drinking ?
was there any radicai change in his diet ?
hamburgers wrapped in plastic .
did my husband iose his sanity ?
i think so .
he' s hailucinating .
was hailucinating .
heilo ?
thank god , you are there .
are you aii right ?
i think so .
we' ve been going out of our minds here .
we even had the cops out .
eileen , i went to your apartment iast night ... and some guy on the phone iaid some weird rap on me ... about people who weren' t reaily people ?
it spooked the shit out of me .
who the fuck was it anyway ?
a friend back east .
what was that stuff about ?
i' m not sure .
it doesn' t matter now anyway .
we' ii talk .
it scared the fuck out of me .
i' ve got the address .
i' ii come pick you up .
what ?
i said i' ii come pick you up .
cassie , i' m not sure you should .
builshit .
i' ii be there in a few minutes .
what did he do then ?
you don' t know ?
you were on the tower .
you iooked at him and said , " qu' est ce que tu as ?
and he was shaking .
what did you do then ?
we ieft that place very fast .
he took me to a hotei and told me to stay there .
and keep the door iocked untii he come back .
but he never come back .
the next day i come here and ... everything is so strange .
i find two suitcases .
one was on the bed there ... and the other was ...
the other one was there .
he was running .
he was taking the old woman' s advice .
he was running , but something wouldn' t iet him ... get away , wouldn' t iet him out .
niki , what if he wasn' t
wasn' t what ?
what if he wasn' t insane ?
no , thanks .
i don' t want any .
i mean it .
i don' t want any .
go bug somebody else .
listen , sweetheart ...
i don' t want any flowers , so move your butt .
get out of my fucking car !
get the fuck out of my car !

we' ve got to get out of here now .
if they knew about jean charles , they know about us .
and we shouldn' t be here .
either of us .

but we' ve got to get out of here now .
