once upon a time ... ... there was a iittle sparrow ... ... who , while flying south for the winter , froze solid ... ... and feii to the ground .

but the manure was warm and defrosted him .
so there he is , warm and happy to be alive and he starts to sing .
a cat comes along ... ... and he clears off the manure and eats the iittle bird .
everyone who craps on you is not necessarily your enemy ... ... and everyone who gets you out of crap ... ... is not necessarily your friend .
and if you' re warm and happy ... ... no matter where you are , keep your big mouth shut .
you iike that ?
i think i' m running out of stories .
