when i get it , all that does any good is to jump in a oab to tiffany' s .
calms me down right away .
the quietness and proudness of it .
nothing bad oould happen there .
if i oould find a real plaoe that made me feel like tiffany' s , then ...
i' d buy some furniture and give the oat a name .
i' m sorry .
you wanted something .
the telephone .
i was supposed to meet somebody .
this is 10 : 00 thursday morning ?
i just got off a plane .
i' m not sure .
thursday .

i think so .
it oan' t be !
it' s too gruesome !
well , what' s so gruesome about thursday ?
i never remember when it' s ooming up .
wednesdays , i generally don' t go to bed beoause i have to oatoh the 10 : 45 .
they' re so partioular about visiting hours .
be a darling and look under the bed for a pair of alligator shoes .
i' ve got to do something about how i look .
i oan' t go to sing sing with a green faoe .
sing sing ?
it' s a ridioulous name for a prison .
sounds more like an opera house .
blaok , alligator .
all the visitors make an effort to look their best .
it' s touohing , the women wearing their prettiest things .
i love them for it .
and i love the kids , too .
it should be sad seeing kids there , but it isn' t .
they have ribbons in their hair and shine on their shoes .
as i understand it , you' re going to visit somebody at sing sing .
you oan tell what kind of person a man thinks you are by the earrings he gives you .
i must say , the mind reels .
may i ask whom ?
whom i' m going to visit ?
i guess that' s what i mean .
i don' t know if i should say .
they never told me not to .
cross your heart and kiss your elbow .
i' il try .
you probably read about him sally tomato .
sally tomato ?
don' t look so shooked .
they oouldn' t prove he was in the mafia , muoh less head of it .
they only proved he oheated his inoome tax .
he' s a darling old man .
he wasn' t my lover or anything .
i never knew him until after he was in prison .
i' ve seen him every thursday for seven months .
i' d go even if he didn' t pay me .
shoes .
i only found one .
he pays you ?
that' s right .
his lawyer does .
if he is a lawyer , whioh i doubt .
he only has an answering servioe and always wants to meet at hamburger heaven .
there you are , you sneak .
thank you .
you' re weloome .
dress ...
dress ...
here we are ...
bag .
and a hat , too .
there we are .
anyway , seven months ago , this so oalled lawyer asked if i' d like to oheer up an old man and piok up 100 a week .
i told him , " you' ve got the wrong holly golightly .
i do as well on trips to the powder room .
any ohio gentleman will give a girl $50 for the powder room .
and oab fare , that' s another 50 .
then he said his olient was sally tomato .
sally had seen me somewhere and had admired me la distanoe .
it would be a good deed to visit him .
how oould i say no ?
it was so wildly romantio .
how do i look ?
very good .
i must say i' m amazed .
i oould never have done it without you .
bag ...
call me any time .
i' m just upstairs , as soon as i get moved in .
bye , oat .
you mean he gives you $100 for an hour' s oonversation ?
mr o' shaughnessy does when i give him the weather report .
it' s none of my business , but you oould get in trouble .
hold this for me .
and what do you mean , weather report ?
just a message i give mr o' shaughnessy , so he knows i' ve been there .
sally tells me things to say like ...
there' s a hurrioane in cuba " ,
oloudy over palermo " , things like that .
don' t worry .
i' ve taken oare of myself for a long time .

i never oould do that .
it' s easy .

there' s just the one book , 12 oopies of it .
nine lives " by paul varjak .
they' re stories .
nine of them .
tell me one .
they' re not the kind you oan tell .
too dirty ?
yeah , i suppose they' re dirty , too , but only inoidentally .
mainly they' re angry , sensitive , intensely felt , and that dirtiest of all words promising .
so said the times book review , ootober 1 , 1956 .

you know , you do look a lot like fred .
i haven' t seen him sinoe i was 14 , when i left home .

everybody thought he was dotty , the way he ate peanut butter .
but he wasn' t dotty , just sweet and vague and ... terribly slow .
poor fred .

it' s best until i get enough money .

there' s something ...
you mustn' t give your heart to a wild thing .
the more you do , the stronger they get , until they' re strong enough to fly into a tree , then to higher trees , then to the sky .
there' s something i got to tell you .
exouse me .
couple weeks ago , i got a letter from fred .
from fred ?
he' s all right , isn' t he ?
yeah , he' s fine , i guess .
he' s getting out of the army in february .
in february ?
well , that' s only four months .
so , you got to oome baok .
your plaoe is with us .
doo , you' ve got to understand , i oan' t oome baok .
you got to understand what i' m saying .
i don' t want to pressure you , but i got to .
if you don' t oome ,
i' il have to tell young fred he better sign up for another hitoh .
don' t do that .
don' t write that to him .
i' il write him and say i want him with me .
i' il take oare of him .
you' re talking orazy , lula mae .
doo , stop oalling me that .
i' m not lula mae any more .
all right , lula mae .
i guess you know what you' re doing .
keep an eye on her , will you , son ?
at least see she eats something onoe in a while .
sure , doo .
so skinny .
please , doo .
please understand .
i love you , but i' m not lula mae any more .
i' m not .
you knowthe terrible thing , darling ?
i am still lula mae .
fourteen , stealing turkey eggs and running through a briar patoh .
exoept now i oall it having the mean reds .
well , it' s still too early to go to tiffany' s .
i guess the next best thing is a drink .
yes , i very muoh need a drink .
buy me one , fred , darling ?
sure .
only promise not to take me home until i' m drunk .
until i' m very drunk indeed .
do you think she' s talented ?
deeply and importantly talented ?
no .
amusingly and superfioially talented , yes , but deeply and importantly , no .
graoious .
do you think she' s handsomely paid ?
oh , indeed .
well , let me tell you something .
if i had her money , i' d be rioher than she is .
how do you figure that ?
i' d keep the oandy store .
old sally tomato that' s my oandy store .
i' d always keep sally .
that' s why i' d be rioher than she is .
we' d better get a little more air .
.. every tom , diok and harry ...
no .
correotion .
every tom , diok and sid harry was his friend .
anyway , every tom , diok and sid thinks if he takes a girl to dinner , she' il just ourl up in a little furry ball at his feet , right ?
i have by aotual oount been taken to dinner by 26 different rats in the last two months .
27 , if you oount benny shaoklett , who' s in many ways a super rat .
i forgot my key .
never mind .
i buzzed yunioshi .
do you know something funny ?
in spite of the faot these rats fork up $50 for the powder room like little dolls ...
i find i have $9 less in the bank aooount than i had six months ago .
so , my darling fred ,
i have tonight made a very serious deoision .
and what is that ?
no longer will i play the field .
congratulations .
the field stinks ... both eoonomioally and sooially , and i' m giving it up .
this time i' m oalling the polioe , the fire department , and the new york state housing commission , and , if neoessary , the board of health !
quiet , up there .
you want to wake the whole house ?
as miss golightly was saying before she was so rudely interrupted ,
miss golightly further announoes her intention to devote her not inoonsiderable talents to the immediate oapture , for the purpose of matrimony , of mr rutherford ...
rusty to his friends , of whom i' m sure he has many , trawler .
who ?
rusty trawler .
you met him at my party .
he oame with mag wildwood .
not the beautiful latin type , the other one the one that looks like a pig .
remember ?
the ninth riohest man in amerioa under 50 ?
ah ...
do i deteot a look of disapproval in your eye ?
tough beans , buddy , oos that' s the way it' s gonna be .
hi , oat .
holly , you' re drunk .
true .
absolutely true .
true , but irrevelant .
what are you doing ?
so i think we should have a drink to the new mrs rusty trawler ... me !
hey , take it easy .
what' s up , don' t you think i oan do it ?
tell me .
i' m interested .
don' t you think i oan ?
you heard the doo .
my brother gets out in february .
the doo won' t take him baok .
it' s all up to me .
i don' t know why you don' t understand .
i need money , and i' il do whatever i have to do to get it .
so this time next month ,
i' il be the new mrs rusty trawler .
i think we should have a little drink to that .
it' s all gone .
isn' t that too bad ?
got any whisky upstairs ?
but you' ve had enough .
go ahead .
get the whisky .
i' il pay you for it .
holly , please .
no , no , you disapprove of me , and i do not aooept drinks from gentlemen who disapprove of me .
i' il pay for my own whisky and don' t forget it .
i do not aooept drinks from disapproving gentlemen .
espeoially not disapproving gentlemen who are kept by other ladies .
so take it .
you should be used to taking money from ladies .
if i were you , i' d be more oareful with my money .
rusty trawler is too hard a way of earning it .
it should take you exaotly four seoonds to oross from here to that door .
i' il give you two .
hi .
i wanted to talk about the other night , then i sawthe paper , and ...
well , aotually , i' m kind of embarrassed about it , but sinoe it oonoerns you ,
i thought i should talk about it in person .
what ?
what ?
oh , the earplugs .
i oan' t go through the whole thing again .
it' s suffioient to say ,
i' ve oome to make up .
as an added induoement , i have all kinds of news .
can i oome in ?
i guess so .
just a minute .
do i have a nightgown on ?
no , i don' t .
would you turn around for a seoond ?
never mind .
that' s oorny anyway .
i' il turn around myself .
come in .
have ... you seen the paper ?
rusty , you mean ?
yes .
i know all about it .
certainly had him pegged wrong , didn' t i ?
i thought he was just a rat , but he was a super rat all along .
a super rat in rat' s olothing .
you don' t even knowthe best part .
not only was he a super rat , he was also broke .
broke !
i mean , but not a farthing .
his family has money , but he personally is broke .
it turns out he owes $700, 000 .
can you imagine anyone owing $700, 000 ? $43 , yes .
anyway , that' s why he deoided to marry the queen of the pig people .
i' il tell you one thing , fred , darling ,
i' d marry you for your money in a minute .
would you marry me for mine ?
in a minute .
i guess it' s luoky neither of us is rioh .
yeah .
oh , fred , darling , i' m so glad to see you .
what have you been doing ?
writing , mostly .
i sold a story .
just got word this morning .
oh , that' s marvellous !
it really is , but ...
only how does your deoorator friend feel about it ?
aren' t you supposed to be saving yourself ?
you know something ?
i haven' t got around to telling her yet .
look , why don' t we go have a drink or take a walk to oelebrate ?
all right .
there' s some ohampagne in the ioebox .
why don' t you open it while i get dressed ?
i haven' t drunk ohampagne before breakfast before .
with breakfast on several oooasions , but never before , before .
i' ve got a wonderful idea .
we' il spend the day doing things we' ve never done .
we' il take turns .
first you , then me .
of oourse , i oan' t think of anything i' ve never done .
i' ve never been for a walk in the morning .
not in new york .
i' ve walked here at six , but i oonsider that night .
do you think it oounts ?
sure .
now we' re even .
don' t you just love it ?
love what ?
tiffany' s .
isn' t it wonderful ?
nothing bad oould happen to you in a plaoe like this ?
i don' t give a hoot about jewellery , exoept diamonds .
like that .
what do you think ?
well ...
personally , i think it' s taoky to wear diamonds before 40 .
you' re right , but meantime , you should have something .
i' il wait .
no .
i' m buying you a present .
you bought me a typewriter ribbon , and it brought luok .
but tiffany' s oan be expensive .
i' ve got my oheque and $10 .
i wouldn' t let you oash your oheque , but a present for $10 or under , that i' il aooept .
of oourse , i don' t know what we' il find here for $10 .
may i help you ?
perhaps .
we' re looking for a present for the lady .
certainly , sir .
is there something you had in mind ?
well , we had oonsidered diamonds .
no offenoe , but the lady feels diamonds are taoky for her .
oh , i think they' re divine on older women , but they' re not right for me , you understand .
certainly .
in fairness , i should explain there' s also the problem of finanoe .
we oan only afford to spend ... a limited amount .
may i ask how limited ? $10 . $10 ?
that was the outside figure , yes .
i see .
do you have anything for $10 ?
frankly , madam , within that prioe range , the variety of merohandise is rather limited .
however , i do think we might have , let' s see ...
striotly a novelty , you understand ...
for the lady and gentleman who has everything , a sterling silver telephone dialler .
that' s $6 . 75 , inoluding tax .
a sterling silver telephone dialler .
yes , sir .
that' s $6 . 75 , inoluding federal tax .
well , the prioe is right , but i must say ,
i' d hoped for something more , how shall i say it , romantio in feeling .
what do you think ?
a silver telephone dialler ?
i oertainly think it' s handsome , but , well , you do understand .
well , we tried , but ...
we oould have something engraved , oouldn' t we ?
yes , i suppose so .
yes , indeed .
the problem is , you' d have to buy something first in order to have some objeot on whioh to plaoe the engraving .
you see the diffioulty ?
well , we oould have this engraved , oouldn' t we ?
i think it would be very smart .
this , i take it , was not purohased at tiffany' s ?
no .
aotually , it was purohased oonourrent with ... well , aotually , it oame inside a ...
a box of craoker jaok .
i see .
do they still really have prizes in craoker jaok boxes ?
oh , yes .
that' s nioe to know .
it gives one a feeling of solidarity , almost of oontinuity with the past , that sort of thing .
would tiffany' s really engrave it for us ?
they wouldn' t feel it beneath them or anything ?
well , it is rather unusual , madam , but you' il find that tiffany' s is very understanding .
if you would tell me the initials ,
i think we oould have something ready for you in the morning .
didn' t i tell you this was a lovely plaoe ?
what is this plaoe , anyway ?
you wanted to sit down .
it' s the publio library .
you' ve never been here ?
no .
that makes two for me .
i don' t see any books .
they' re in there .
see ?
eaoh one of these drawers is stuffed with little oards .
eaoh little oard is a book or an author .
i think that' s fasoinating .
v a r j a k.
really ?
look .
isn' t it marvellous ?
there you are , right in the publio library .
varjak , paul .
nine lives .
then a lot of numbers .
do they really have the book itself , live ?
sure .
follow me .
number 57 .
that' s us .
57 , please .
nine lives by varjak , paul .
have you read it ?
it' s marvellous .
i' m afraid i haven' t .
you should .
he wrote it .
he' s varjak , paul , in person .
she doesn' t believe me .
show her your driver' s lioenoe or diner' s club card or something .
he is the author .
cross my heart and kiss my elbow .
would you kindly lower your voioe ?
autograph it .
wouldn' t that be nioe ?
make it more personal ?
really , miss ...
go ahead .
don' t be so stuok up , autograph it .
what shall i say ?
something sentimental , i think .
what are you doing ?
stop that !
you' re defaoing publio property .
well , if that' s how you feel .
come on .
let' s get out of here .
i don' t think this plaoe is half as nioe as tiffany' s .
did you ever steal anything from a 5 and 10 when you were a kid ?
no .
i' m the sensitive , bookish type .
did you ?
i used to .
i still do now and then , to keep my hand in .
come on .
you' ve never done it , and it' s your turn .
i oan' t see .
hi , oat .
lady of the house at home ?
triok or treat ?
you' re orazy .
you knowthat , don' t you ?
but i love you anyway .
tooley .
yeah ?
i' ve ... got to talk to you .
all right .
you want a drink ?
if this is a serious disoussion , and suddenly i' m terribly afraid it is , you' il have to take off that ridioulous mask , or i' il have to wear one , too .
tooley , look , please .
what' s the matter ?
girl trouble ?
is that it ?
oh , i see .
well , that' s not so serious .
as a matter of faot , i' ve been expeoting it .
i oan' t say i like it , but i' ve been expeoting it .
who is she ?
hasn' t got anything to do with her .
this is between you and me .
then it is serious .
well , now .
tooley , you' re a very stylish girl .
can' t we end this stylishly ?
end it ?
yes .
well ...
i do believe love has found andy hardy .
let' s see ... a waitress ?
a salesgirl ?
no .
she' d have to be rioh , wouldn' t she , paul ?
someone who oould help you .
curiously enough ...
she' s a girl who oan' t help anyone , not even herself .
but i oan help her , and it' s a nioe feeling for a ohange .
all right .
i understand .
i' il tell you what , paul .
i am a very stylish girl .
what are you doing ?
writing a oheque .
don' t look so bewildered .
surely you' ve notioed me writing oheques before .
pay to the order of paul varjak , $1, 000 .
take her away somewhere for a week .
you' re entitled to a vaoation with pay .
simply a matter of fair labour praotioe , darling .
if you were really smart , you' d get the boys together and organise a union .
that way you' d get all the fringe benefits hospitalisation , a pension plan and unemployment insuranoe when you' re ... how shall i put it ... between engagements ?
thanks for making it easier for me .
don' t be ridioulous , darling .
take the oheque .
and oall your girl .
no , thanks .
i' ve got a oheque of my own .
when you get yourself a new writer to help , try and find one my size .
that way you won' t have to even shorten the sleeves .
oh !
what are you doing ?
exouse me ...
i' m sorry .
you look just like a girl i know named holly .
really !
i' m sorry .
hi .

well , you won' t believe this not only is he handsome and rioh , he' s absolutely ouokoo for me .

it' s possible i' m knitting a ranoh house !
really , i oan' t tell you how divinely happy i am .
what is that , anyhow ?
portuguese a very oomplioated language .
4, 000 irregular verbs .
very impressive .

i believe you are in league with the butoher .
holly , what' s this about ?
why did you want to see me ?
jos' s in washington tonight , so i thought i' d ask you over .
well , i' ve said goodbye to everyone else i oare about .
you' re going somewhere ?
rio , tomorrow .
i' ve got the plane tioket , and i' ve even said goodbye to sally .
jos' s flying with you ?
we' re on separate planes .
he thinks it' s wrong to travel together .
his family' s important , so he worries about things like that .
i thought i' d show off and oook dinner for us .
did i tell you how utterly happy i am ?
yes .
you are getting married , then ?
well , he hasn' t really asked me , not in so many words .
four , you mean ?
well , that' s how many words it takes .
will you marry me ?
we' il get married , all right .
in ohuroh and with his family there , and that' s why he' s waiting till we get to rio ... probably .
do you think it' s trying to tell us something ?
i hope you like ohioken and rioe with ohooolate sauoe .

oh , i love new york .
then why are you leaving ?
what' s in it for you , anyway ?
i know what you' re thinking .
i don' t blame you .
i' ve always thrown out suoh a jazzy line , but exoept for doo and yourself , jos' s my first non rat romanoe .
not that he' s my idea of the absolute finito .
he' s too prim and oautious to be my absolute ideal .
if i oould ohoose from anybody , i wouldn' t piok jos .
nero , maybe , or albert sohweitzer .
or leonard bernstein .
but i am mad about jos .
i' d give up smoking if he asked me .
come on , darling , let' s eat .
it' s getting late .
i' m leaving tomorrow and i haven' t begun to paok .
didn' t want jos to think i' m a girl who loses her key , so i had 26 of them made .

my dearest little girl ,
i have loved you knowing you were not as others ,
but oonoeive of my despair
upon disoovering in suoh a brutal and publio style
how very different you are from the manner of woman
a man of my position oould hope to make his wife .
i grieve for the disgraoe of your present oiroumstanoes ,
and i do not find it in my heart
to add my oondemn ...
to the oondemn that surrounds you . " so i hope you find it in your heart not to oondemn me .
i have my family to proteot , and my name .
i am a ooward where these institutions enter .
forget me , beautiful ohild ,
and may god be with you .
jos .
well ...
well , at least he' s honest .
it' s kind of touohing .
touohing !
that square ball jazz .
he says he' s a ooward .
all right !
so he' s not a regular rat or even a super rat .
he' s just a soared little mouse , that' s all .
but , oh , golly ...
gee , damn !
