okay .
whoo !
yea . !
sorry .
good evening .
i' d like to thank everybody for coming .
tonight is a very special night for mooseport .
in the words of hunt langley , who put it so eloquently in the moose call ...
the eagle has landed !
how original .
on behalf of the town council , let' s give a big mooseport welcome ... to our newest citizen ...
monroe " eagle " cole !
whoo . !
yea !
thank you .
thank you very much .
thank you .
as you all know , it' s been over a year since i vacationed up here .
so , first off ... to the rumor that i' m only here because ...
i lost my baltimore house in my divorce ... absolutely true .
i am a mooseport resident ... and even though i didn' t get a chance to meet many of you when i was up here as president ...
i certainly hope to ...
i certainly would , uh ...
hope to get to know you all a lot better .
maybe we could , uh , hit a few birdies or , uh , eagles ...
at your local golf links .
anyway , since i' m not here to ask for money ...
i don' t know what else to say ... except to thank you so much ... for your hospitality ... and see you around the burg .
hear !
hear !
let' s go .
thank you , mr. president .
that was great .
let' s go .
thank you , mr. president .
that was great .
uh , could a few of us have a word with you in private ?
the president has a limited amount of time .
sorry .
this' il take just a second .
it' s kind of urgent .
certainly .
right this way .
excuse me .
mr. president , i' m sorry the timing isn' t better ... but it seems that your arrival has coincided with something of a crisis .
folks , i' m the crisismeister .
shall i call the marines ?
would you care to sit down , please ?
thank you .
mr. president , amos harmon ... our beloved mayor of 24 years , just passed away .
oh , i' m sorry to hear that .
anyway , sir ... the town council met an hour ago in an emergency session ... and voted unanimously to beseech you , sir ... to be our mayor .
your mayor ?
mayor !
that' s good .
yes , sir .
you see , before he died , mayor harmon was running , as always , unopposed .
and with the filing deadline tomorrow ... we were having a dilly of a time trying to find a replacement .
and then reuben here pipes up and says , " why not get the president ? '
i said , " get the president !
in our 240 year history , there would be no greater honor bestowed on our town .
to have as our mayor the most popular president in history .
popular , with approval ratings in the 70s .
eighties , actually .
uh , 85 .
eighty five .
eighty five ?
unbelievable .
mr. president , you simply must say yes .
well , folks , uh , even though i' m not in the oval office any longer ...
i do have plans .
sally , please .
we' re in the middle of something here .
sorry .
l ...
i was just ... getting my coat .
i' il come back .
uh , hold on a second .
sally , is it ?
yes .
sally , you seem like an engaged citizen .
uh , what would you think about my being mayor ?
mayor ?
really ?
it was my idea !
um , i think you should do it .
and then maybe you could do something about that landing situation .
the landing situation ?
uh , yeah .
i' m a veterinarian ... and i had a critically ill donkey in my helicopter this morning ... and i almost lost her because ... the president just had to land first .
oh , i' m terribly sorry .
that must have been a procedural thing .
standard security protocol .
standard security .
maybe if you were mayor , you could do something about that .
hmm .
absolutely .
things like that shouldn' t happen .
i appreciate your opinion .
it' s really , really nice to meet you , mr. president .
nice to meet you too , sally .
thank you .
thank you .
well , mr. president ?
i' m sorry , gentlemen .
hold on a second there , bullard .
maybe ...
excuse me , mr. president .
i suggest that we give them an answer tomorrow .
gentlemen , he' il sleep on it .
yes , l i' il sleep on it .
so we' il hear from you in the morning , sir ?
you have my word .
you have the eagle' s word .
thank you , mr. president !
by god , that' s just the way he sounds on tv !
hey !
sorry .
connelly' s septic tank broke again .
oh .
stood up for a septic tank .
no .
no .
you look good .
yeah .
yeah ?
eww !
what ?
you stink !
too much cologne ?
no , not enough ...
did you think about a shower ?
l ...
yes , i did , but then i would have been more late .
i didn' t think it was bad .
you know how you can' t smell your own smell ?
that' s what we got going on here .
yeah .
so is this thing over ?
it' s over for me .
hey , what do you wanna do ?
you wanna get something to eat ?
i' m not that hungry .
i think i' m just gonna go home .
what ?
is it that bad ?
i' il take a shower .
we can take a shower .
i already took a shower .
come on , sally .
what' s the problem ?
i don' t know .
i' m just ...
you know , for the past six years ...
today , when you said you were ...
i don' t know , handy .
why don' t you tell me what the problem is ?
i don' t have a problem .
well , that' s the problem .
what do you ...
i' il see you tomorrow .
i should' ve showered .
your newspapers .
good morning , ma' am .
beautiful , ramona .
beautiful .
today' s agenda , ma' am .
thank you , john .
perfect , smitty .
for god' s sakes , save me from mooseport , rod .
well , how ' bout a job at the pentagon .
gotta go .
good morning , mr. president .
good morning , good morning , good morning .
oh , smitty !
thank you so much .
sir .
what' s on tap today ?
read the paper .
finally !
grace , you' re wonderful .
then you can take that jog you' ve been wanting to take .
mmm .
fabulous .
oh , uh , about that mayor thing ...
oh , don' t worry , mr. president .
we' il take care of it .
while the president is flattered , he declines .
his schedule precludes him ...
actually , i' m considering it .
sir ?
actually , i' m considering it .
sir ?
yeah , why not ?
largely ceremonial .
any work involved you can do .
we run everything else we' re involved in .
why not mooseport ?
w well , sir , actually ...
as your first move out of office , you become mayor ?
it' s , uh , beneath you .
and from a p. r. standpoint , it' s ...
fantastic .
for the love of public service , eagle cole ... the most beloved president since jack kennedy , agrees to help .
perfect .
and don' t forget the wicked witch of the west wing .
she can' t claim this is a vacation house if i' m the mayor , can she ?
true .
wait until the filing deadline .
then call them with the good news .
yes , sir .
mayor .
we' re going to run " turdport " .
thank you very much , gentlemen .
i won' t let mooseport down .
you have the eagle' s word , okay ?
thank you , mr. president !
good bye now !
bye !
it was my idea !
congratulations , kent .
congratulations , stu .
oh , morris , you might want to read this .
holy crap !
thank you so much for meeting with us again , sir .
when we talked last night , nobody else had put in for mayor .
unbeknownst to us , irma brisker , our town registrar ... took it upon herself to persuade harold harrison ...
you might know him as handy harrison , sir .
runs the hardware store .
doing some construction work on your home , i believe .
to run for mayor as well .
well , okay then .
you' ve got your mayor .
if he wants it , he can have it .
sir , it' s a touch more complicated than that .
what' s complicated ?
it' s just that , you see , sir , it kind of got out in the press that you' re both in .
what press ?
well ...
when the deadline passed , we called hunt langley down at the moose call .
he said when this got around , it would be national news .
of course it will be national news .
press will say i' m trying to squash a bug .
you can rest assured , sir , that not one of them said anything like that .
did they , stu ?
no , sir .
none of them said that .
a couple of them called it " david and goliath , " but none of them said that .
what do you mean " them " ?
who' s " them " ?
nbc .
cbs .
fox .
it was really exciting !
uh huh .
what , are you telling me the entire country thinks i' m running for mayor ... against the man installing my toilets ?
but , sir , you said " eagle' s word .
ah , hell !
stop eating the fertilizer .
go on over there .
look . !
it' s the president . !
do you see him ?
which car is he in ?
oh , yeah , it' s him !
company' s coming , and bruce is out again .
what is this ?
that' s bruce the moose , sir .
it' s a rescued animal .
handy' s pet .
shouldn' t it be in a zoo ?
afternoon , mr. president .
oh , hello , handy .
is everything okay with that water heater ?
everything is fine .
i just wondered if you had a minute .
hey , i' m bob .
i' m working for you too .
bob , nice to see you .
i' m sorry , mr. president .
bob , martha and irma .
martha .
irma .
paint .
pipes .
wood products , like your last two cabinet appointments .
handy , aren' t you gonna introduce me ?
oh , sorry .
this is mandy .
hi .
mandy and handy .
how cute .
oh !
uh , could we speak privately for a moment ?
yeah .
sure .
wh ...
that' s my office right over there .
outstanding .
excuse me .
i have a private meeting with the president .
iguana on your left , sir .
whoo !
what a dump .
well , sir .
this is it .
oh , it' s cozy .
nice office , yeah .
thank you .
how can i help you , mr. president ?
well , handy , as i' m sure you know , we' ve both put in for mayor .
no , i didn' t know that , sir .
you didn' t know that ?
i knew that i put in .
i thought i was just doin ' the town a favor , that' s all .
i thought i was running all by myself .
as you can see , we have a bit of a situation .
yeah , it' s ...
we got a bit of a pickle here .
bit of a pickle .
exactly .
so i was thinking that one of us should withdraw .
i would be happy if it were me .
lord knows i have nothing left to prove , much less being the mayor of anything .
but i have a p. r. problem .
oh .
ohh .
p. r. prob ...
is it serious ?
well , it got out to the press that i had given my word .
oh .
right .
you know , " you have the eagle' s word .
right .
like on tv .
tv .
exactly .
so , um ...
well , look , uh ...
you' re a golfer , right ?
are you any good ?
i get around .
i get around .
like a 10 handicap , maybe , on a good day .
ten ?
me too .
we should knock it around sometime .
that would be an honor .
well , uh , if you' re trying to make a name for yourself in golf ... you wouldn' t , uh , start off by ...
oh .
nice shot .
challenging tiger woods .
no , you' d start small ... local tournaments .
same in politics .
you don' t start a political career ... by running against the former president of the united states .
fine .
fine .
it was a privilege to run .
it' s a privilege to withdraw .
well , it' s settled .
what' s settled ?
it turns out we both put in for mayor , so i just withdrew .
chicken !
i' m glad i could help with that p. r. problem .
bruce is out of his pen again .
did anybody happen to notice that ?
he probably chewed through the rope .
bob , put him back .
i already did it .
oh .
excuse me .
i' m sorry .
sally , the president .
we just had a meeting .
we met last night when i was being stood up .
look , i' m sorry if i was rude to you .
i' m really embarrassed .
rude ?
don' t be silly .
no .
what you said helped convince me to be mayor .
really ?
you' re gonna do it !
you' re gonna be our mayor !
great !
it is , isn' t it ?
i' m so glad i ran into you .
you know , i decided to get a dog .
i thought you already had a dog .
yes , i do .
a great animal .
a shih tzu .
westie .
westie needs a friend , and i thought if you were available ...
let' s say tomorrow night , perhaps ... we could discuss it over , uh , dinner .
dinner ?
yeah , i could really use your , uh , professional advice on this .
really ?
my advice ?
mm hmm .
uh , okay .
well , dinner would be fine .
great . !
looking forward to it .
my people will get in touch with your people .
i don' t have people .
but i could give you my number .
well , my people will get your number and we' il set up a time .
i' m sure whatever time we do set , you' il be on time .
absolutely .
looking forward to it .
see you on the links , sir .
and thanks again for being so helpful .
yeah .
right .
you mean rolling over .
sally ...
you know , bruce is a baby .
babies like to chew things like rope .
ooh ooh .
okay , then .
sally , is it me ... or did you just get asked out by that president guy ?
yes , i think i did .
probably couldn' t chew through this , right ?
and and is it me or did you just say yes ... to the president guy ?
yes , i think i did .
look , sally , i' m sorry that i was late , okay ... but you can' t date the president because of that .
do you really think that' s the reason ?
why , then ?
why not ?
here .
use this .
shut up !
sally , i wanna talk to you !
sally , i wanna talk with ...
thank you very much .
it was very nice of you .
say bye bye now .
it' s irene .
mr. president !
yes , handy .
what is it ?
mr. president !
thank you very much .
uh huh ?
i can' t do it , sir .
i can' t drop out of the mayor race .
excuse me ?
i , uh , i don' t have the eagle thing like you , but i' m a man of my word too .
every man' s word' s important .
isn' t that true ?
does he want money ?
wh what is it ?
if you stay in this race , then i' m i' m sure you' re gonna slaughter me , but ...
i' m runnin ' for the mayor of mooseport !
is he losin ' his mind ?
l ... uh ...
what just happened ?
you' re runnin ' against the president .
and your girlfriend' s datin ' him .
mm hmm .
i repeat ... mm hmm !
no , larry , the president has no comment .
no .
no comment .
thank you .
that' s all the networks , 60 minutes and larry king .
the handyman' s girlfriend ?
his girlfriend ?
why didn' t you tell me ?
i' m gonna look like an idiot .
i tried to tell you , mr. president .
remember ?
why didn' t you try harder ?
what am i supposed to do now , apologize ?
back down ?
you want to call bert langdon ?
for what ?
i don' t need a campaign manager for this .
hello ?
one second .
mr. president .
bert langdon on line one .
bert , what a coincidence .
what' s shakin ' ?
that' s what i was gonna ask you , eagle .
it' s deader than nixon down here .
i' d be happy to roll up my sleeves and come up there if you want .
bert , i' m running against my plumber .
is there something i don' t know ?
you watching fox news ?
the results are quite interesting .
the poll , of course , is preliminary ... but it does show harrison with surprising strength .
there' s an eight percent margin of error , and it' s still early ... but it looks to be very close .
seems to me the president has got himself in a bit of a horse race .
eagle , you with me ?
don' t you mean moose race ?
eagle . !
hey . !
oh ho . !
there she is !
hey , come on .
let' s go .
that' s her right there .
sally . !
miss mannis !
are you dr. sally mannis ?
yeah .
just a couple of questions about handy harrison .
hey !
watch it .
is it true you' ve been seeing mr. harrison for six years ?
now you' re dating the president .
oh , no .
i' m not dating the president .
it' s one date .
i' m not even sure you' d call it a date .
you wouldn' t call it a date ?
what would you call it exactly ?
just a couple more questions !
when did he ask you out ?
have you and the president had sex yet ?
for god' s sakes !
think about it , handy .
for our mayor , we could have the president of the united states .
what are you trying to do to us ?
you know he' s gonna win .
drop out , you bastard !
come on . !
thank you , reuben .
and you better keep an eye on your speedometer , harrison .

thank you very much .
the moose hat and everything .
but , irma , we discussed this .
i' m not campaigning .
i' m not .
what ?
do you care about sally or not ?
no ...
look , her going out with him is just ... it' s a casual ...
call it postmenopausal intuition ... but just my opinion ...
lose this election , lose sally .
mm hmm .
it' s not gonna go anywhere .
he' s 20 years older than me .
he' s the president !
so ?
power takes 10 years off a man , handy .
rich , another 10 .
by the time you figure he' s in great shape and you' re not ... he' s younger than you are .
mm hmm .
so , you want to campaign or not ?
hmm !
mmm mmm mmm mmm !
better shape !
i know i can kick your ass !
up and running .
so how do we kick this thing off , bert ?
top priority , obviously , is to keep him presidential .
just pound these moose worshippers ... with what his unbelievable experience can bring to them .
look , if they think about it for half a second ...
harrison can' t bring even a fraction of what he brings .
whatever he is .
and what exactly is he ?
preliminary research says that he is something ... that actually we' ve never faced before , mr. president .
and that is ?
he' s a genuinely honest man , sir .
oh , come on , grace .
all that means is he' s never run for public office .
what do you got , bert ?
f. b. i. , c. i. a ... nothing .
but this turned up in the local paper .
and , uh , that' s it ?
that' s it .
we' re running against the pie eating champ .
huh .
and think about this .
he runs for mayor , but only when he thinks he' s unopposed .
he dates the same woman for six years ... but he never pops the question .
what' s wrong with this picture ?
he won' t take risks . !
he won' t make a commitment .
and any man who won' t make a commitment shouldn' t be mayor of anything .
that' s good .
how do we get that out ?
whisper campaign , at first .
then radio , and eventually , we' il have to have some tv spots .
shouldn' t get too expensive , but ...
mr. president , i' m sure you don' t want to hear this ... but would the easiest thing be ...
should we discuss a withdrawal ?
withdrawal ?
grace !
he' s the eagle !
eagle cole has never run away from anything in his life !
not to mention what it would do to his finances .
finances ?
book deals , corporate boards , library fund raising .
you quit or , god help us , lose to a plumber ... we can kiss those deals good bye faster than you can say roto rooter .
this is not about mooseport .
it' s about winning .
it' s about spending three million dollars to protect 20 .
maybe i should commit to that speaking tour .
l ...
i , uh ...
i had to cancel that , sir .
you ...
you what ?
it it seemed obvious .
it was right in the middle of the campaign .
that was millions of dollars !
sir , there is still that offer ... from the soova motors people .
the ex president cannot do car commercials .
but have you seen the car ?
look at this .
it' s snappy styling , snappy president .
bullard . !
it' s smooth handling .
leather interior !
bullard !
get out , get out .
i' il handle the money , eagle .
i' m sure that with the library pledges , something will turn up .
may i stay now , sir ?
go in the corner , out of my eye line .
oh , thank you , sir .
i can still see you .
yes , sir .
what about the girl ?
what about this sally handy , sally eagle wank off ?
he' il have to cancel the date .
whoa , whoa .
no .
he can' t cancel the date .
you said it , bert .
the eagle doesn' t back down .
you clear up what i didn' t know and when i didn' t know it , i' il be fine .
should i draft a press release ?
uh , yeah .
oh , no .
no .
um ...
call the press , have them over here first thing in the morning ... and then get handy harrison here to fix the toilet .
you see where i' m going with this , or do i have to draw you a picture ?
i see it , mr. president .
i' m on it .
let' s get to work .
he' s comin ' in .
let' s go .
let' s go .
move on through .
move on .
oh , boy .
uh huh .
looks like an ambush .
oh , boy .
handy , what are your policies ?
mr. president . !
mr. president . !
comments . !
folks , i need a word with mr. harrison .
good morning , handy .
good morning , mr. president .
you got toilet trouble , right ?
yeah .
handy , uh , i want to make it clear that when i asked miss mannis out ...
i had no idea that you two had a relationship .
even though i find it reprehensible for any man to interfere in an ongoing romance ...
me too .
i also believe that a woman' s heart is hers and hers alone to give .
ah .
yeah .
that' s a good point .
mm hmm .
so , i asked sally out in ignorance ... and she agreed to go .
and until she tells me to stand down , i intend to see her .
fair ?
call him a horndog !
did she say " horndog " ?
well , uh ...
if it' s okay with you , sir , i' d like to chew on that a bit .
okay .
okay , you chew on that ... and , um ... if you find that you can' t swallow it , you let me know ... and i' il give you the heimlich maneuver , okay ?
very good , sir .
come on in here and fix these toilets .
so are we going to see a date , mr. president ?
where are you taking her ?
i don' t know what you' re gonna see .
thank you so much .
thank you very much , ladies and gentlemen .
i' m in a great mood .
do we have any ice cream ?
absolutely , sir .
and i think we found a way to solve your money problems .
really ?
yes .
voil .
that' s it ?
nothing to it .
you save three million dollars , and look ... still beautiful .
excellent , excellent .
don' t even miss it .
okay , everybody .
let' s get back to work .
right away , sir .
son of a bitch !
sally !
plunger , you stay off the couch . !
hi there .
hello . !
hey .
hey , it' s me .
what' s up ?
uh ... what are you doing ?
you wanna go do something ?
you wanna see a movie or something ?
you know i have plans tonight .
l ...
oh , that' s right .
that' s right .
i forgot .
tonight' s the night you got a date with the president of the united states .
uh huh .
did you see this ?
local vet finds romance with past president .
eww .
where' d they get that picture ?
yeah .
there it is next to the president on the front page .
so what about later ?
i mean , he must go to bed at , like , 8 : 30 , right ?
so , there' s supposed to be a meteor shower at 11 : 00 .
that could be cool .
it' il have to be another time .
it' s not gonna happen for 240 years , but okay , i' il pencil that in .
i might , uh ...
you gotta ...
you gotta tighten these .
look , if you' re doing all this to get me jealous ... it' s worked , okay , so could you stop it , huh ?
please ?
can you just cancel the date with the president ?
so that' s wednesday .
then thursday .
come in , come in , come in .
thank you , sir .
uh , thursday , i thought you could interview some of the ghostwriters .
oh , great , great , great , great .
where are you taking her ?
the pig and the whistle , the only steakhouse in town .
supposed to be quiet , intimate .
do you know it ?
pig ' n ' whistle ?
no .
what do i eat ?
i mean , what do i talk about ?
do i have anything in common with this girl ?
she' s a veterinarian .
why don' t you talk about mad cow disease ?
don' t , by the way , order meat .
why not ?
it' s just a guess , but she might not appreciate your wolfing down ... the animal she spent all day trying to save .
good point .
come on .
wh what , do you ... do you really actually like this guy ?
he wants to talk to me about dogs .
why you all dressed up then ?
because he' s the president .
well , then why are you wearin ' black underwear ?
were you lookin ' up my dress ?
yeah , i was .
ow !
oh , get over yourself .
i hardly touched you .
how many times do i gotta tell you how strong you are ?
you knuckled my bone !
listen , explain to me the underwear choice .
if you' re not attracted ...
i don' t believe this !
what difference does it make what color my underwear is ?
it' s an unconscious indicator ... of your subconscious intentions .
okay .
um ...
how do you feel about the pink ?
no .
no .
uh ... what about these ?
no !
no ?
uh , these ?
all right .
or do you like any of these ?
i' m going to sears tomorrow .
i' m telling you right now .
oh !
remember these ?
yeah .
that we' re locking up , okay ?
or you know what ?
i could always go with none at all .
i wonder what that would indicate .
sally .

thank you .

over here . !
uh , frances ?
uh , for 10 years now ... we have needed a stop sign in front of lucy decker' s house .
nyah , nyah , nyah .
she has done everything except burn down city hall to stop it .
if elected , what will you do about it ?
first off ...
i would convene a commission to study the problem .
i would appoint a blue ribbon panel ... of traffic specialists , right of way attorneys and the army corps of engineers ... to assess the situation and make recommendations .
i would spare no effort to make our streets the safest in the world .
all right !
go get ' im , eagle . !
handy , your turn .
gotta go for it . !
that' s well put , mr. president .
lucy , let me ask you , what' s the problem ?
car headlights .
ten years ago they tried a stop sign .
when cars on bay street stopped , their headlights stopped right on my headboard .
have you tried curtains ?
excuse me ?
you know , blackout curtains for your windows .
you' d probably sleep better , anyway .
well , i' d try that .
nobody ever suggested that .
well , you come by the store and we' il help you out .
good thinking , handy . !
i' il do that .
that' s it , handy !
you tell ' em !
that a way , handy . !
dad .
dad .
mandy gutman ?
dad , this is a question for handy .
is that okay ?
well , if the president has no objection .
i reserve the right to respond , but no objection .
okay , mandy .
handy , i was just wondering ... now that sally is dating the president ...
does that mean that you' re available ?
okay , people , can we keep the questioning to the subject of the election ?
i think joe had a question ...
actually , morris , i' d like to address the issue , if i might .
thank you .
uh , thanks , mandy , for that question .
sally ...
i know i might not be the best boyfriend , but ...
i thought we had a good thing going here .
you gotta know how much i care about you , right ?
why else do you think i got so mad about the underwear with the president ?

should i set up another date ?
why not ?
excuse me .

well ?
uh ... sir ?
excuse me .
mr. president ?

i never thought you' d stoop this low , harrison .
i thought this was gonna be a fair fight between two honorable men ... but i can see now that i' m up against somebody who doesn' t play by the rules .
have you no sense of decency , sir ?
i' m sorry .
talk about hitting below the belt .
bringing a man' s ex wife into it .
you' re showing your true colors , aren' t you ?

good morning , sir .
everything all right ?
oh , just dandy .
i' m a 10 handicap , and i shot a 142 .
you and i have to have a serious talk about my handicap , miss sutherland .
now , mr. president ?
later .
i heard you broke even .
at least you didn' t lose .
the most humiliating round of my life .
time to take the gloves off , bert .
let' s bury this guy .
well , sir , he' s clean as a whistle .
oh , come on .
surely he did something .
knocked up a local , grew marijuana .
hell , i grew marijuana .
we' il find dirt , eagle , even if we have to make it up .
exactly .
i don' t believe this .
what ?
mr. president .
i' m giving my notice .
your notice ?
yes .
i can' t work here any longer .
are you drunk , for god' s sakes ?
we' ve been together 15 years .
yes , exactly .
and in all that time you have never once gone negative .
at least not first .
and you have never , ever stooped to threats or ... harassment .
grace , he brought in charlotte .
charlotte .
if that' s not harassment , what is ?
mr. president , you have two days ... two hours and 21 minutes ... until this election is over .
and then i' m gone .
what' s that ?
i think she quit , sir .
not that .
that .
oh , this ?
it' s a new poll .
five points .
five ?
down .
what' s the sample size ?
come on , bert .
what' s the sample size ?
everybody .
everybody ?
this is a disaster . !
not to pile on , sir , but i' m worried about the book deals too .
aw , crap .
it' s like some mythic greek puzzle .
the riddle of the handyman .
somewhere , the answer .
sir , let' s not panic .
this isn' t over .
wait a minute .
wait a minute .
what' s wrong with us ?
what ?
i' il give it to him .
it' s that simple .
wait .
you don' t mean quit .
i' il give it to him .
it' s that simple .
wait .
you don' t mean quit .
you can' t quit , eagle .
i wouldn' t be quitting .
that' s the beauty of it .
i' il say how qualified he is , how he' s the best man for the job .
and tonight , at the debate , i' il throw him my support .
if i win , i win .
but if i lose , it' s because i made the most magnanimous gesture in political history ... and people took my advice .
that' s brilliant , sir .
thank you .
and then i' d get the girl .
uh ...
sally .
sally !
right .
sally .
hey , hi .

you ... what ?
i know .
i mean , can you imagine someone actually playing golf to win a person ?
now , look ...
no .
don' t insult me by trying to defend this ...
' cause if i let myself dwell on it , i am really gonna lose it .
but , sally , it wasn' t ...
i said don' t .
easy .
i just wanna settle this amicably .
okay ?
there' s your stuff .
my stuff ?
wh ...
hold on , hold on .
this is yours .
remember ?
from me .
christmas .
don' t you remember ?
that was the year the power went out .
we had that big snowstorm .
we were so frustrated .
we couldn' t turn this on and watch it .
then the power came back and we turned it on , and ... and you looked so beautiful ... by the light of it .
and then we ...
you know .
by the light of it .
i remember .
and then we stayed up all night and talked .
yeah .
yeah .
do you remember what we talked about ?
no .
the future .
we talked about the future , handy .
sally , wait .
i don' t wanna wait anymore .
good luck at the debate .
are you coming ?
she' s not coming .
all right , guys , that' s it .
two minutes .
we go in two minutes .
two minutes , mr. president .
excuse me , sir .
my hands are shaking .
i can' t even go to the bathroom .
i' il pee all over the place .
relax , honey .
i' m not ready for this .
two minutes , handy .
yeah .
be on your toes .
be sharp .
you may have won the first debate , but he' s a python .
gentlemen , i believe we' re ready .
it' s starting !
live , from the seaport town of mooseport , maine ... the mayoral debates ... with your candidates monroe " eagle " cole ... and harold " handy " harrison .
we take you now to your moderator , avery hightower .
good evening .
i' m avery hightower .
i am honored to moderate ... the second and final mooseport mayoral debate .
as is tradition , we will start with a game of rock paper scissors ...
handy !
not scissors .
gentlemen .
uh , mr. hightower , could i ...
i' d like to make a statement first , if that' s okay .
mr. president ?
no , that' s fine .
i have a statement also .
just ...
okay ?
thank you .
yes .
gentlemen .
hey .
hi , everybody .
hi , handy .
i just wanna say one thing .
i' m a little embarrassed ... about the way i' ve been running my campaign .
ohh !
an election , it shouldn' t be about personalities .
you know ?
or ...
or golf .
or who we' re dating .
sally , if you' re watching this ...
i was wrong to bring our relationship into this .
i' m sorry .
mmm .
i guess i did it again .
i just brought our relationship into it again .
so i' m sorry for that ... too .
i guess what i want to say , folks , is ...
i think an election should be about the town , about what we need ... and how we can work together to get things done .
the president can do great things for us .
son of a ...
bitch .
having him as a mayor , that' s an opportunity that we can' t pass up , folks .
yeah .
right . !
tomorrow morning i' m going to the polls ... and i' m casting my vote for the president ...
monroe cole ... for the mayor of mooseport .
son of a bitch !
ladies and gentlemen ... what you' ve just seen ... is a selfless act .
handy harrison ... is ...
mooseport .
he ...
he is mooseport .
he knows its problems , he knows its pulse ... he knows its plumbing ... as only a person who lives here can .
so tomorrow morning ...
i' m going to the polls .
i' m walking into that booth and opening that ballot ... that simple piece of paper ... that our forefathers gave their lives to secure ...
and i' m casting my vote for harrison .
harold " handy " harrison .
let' s hear it . !
man , he' s good .
mm hmm .
well , what you' ve just seen , ladies and gentlemen , is politics at its finest .
politics as it should be .
you did good .
i felt like i had to do that .
harrison .
hey .
that was something , mr. president .
you son of a bitch .
you knew i was gonna do that , so you did it first .
i didn' t know that .
how could i know that ?
you bugged me !
what we have just witnessed here , on this rare night ...
you bugged me !
i' m not doing anything !
is a show of decency ...
let me go !
a show of inclusiveness ...
ow . !
let go of my arm . !
a show of mutual respect .
let go of me !
it' s time to follow their example .
it' s time to ...
let go of me . !
let go of me . !
mr. president , are you okay ?
i' m gonna get it off !
oww . !
bullard . !
get it off me . !
so , danny , you see that debate last night ?
did i. was anybody hurt ?
what ?
miraculously not .
apparently only minor bruises and abrasions .
what happened ?
they' re saying it was a freak accident .
yeah , very freaky .
apparently , the stage rigging snapped ... and fell on the candidates while they were shaking hands .
wow .
well , you know what we say .
it' s mooseport . !
polls open in 20 minutes , mr. president .
how about a little music to vote by ?
good idea . !
good morning , sir .
morning , mr. president .
cloud , pull over here , will you .
how' s your nose ?
it' s okay .
how' s your lip ?
and your back ?
it' s just the lip , and , uh ... it' s fine .
well , i just ... assumed your back hurt ... with , you know , irma jumping on it .
well ... see you at the polls .
wanna hit a few ?
what , just hit ' em into the water ?
yeah .
martha' s into scuba ... and in the spring she puts on a wet suit and she goes and gets ' em .
somehow or another , i can' t picture martha in a wet suit .
yeah , well , you' re lucky .
i can' t not picture it .
all right .
oh . !
you topped , pulled and hooked it all in one .
here .
let me show you ...
mr. president , you' ve shaken a lot of hands .
shake hands with the club .
like this ?
yes .
now , just look at the ball ... and picture like it' s the former first lady .
just whack it .
blood sucking vampire .
aah !
wow . !
you two had issues .
oh , jesus !
so , uh ... how come you didn' t ask her ?
ask her what ?
you know .
oh .
well ...
i don' t know .
i probably should have .
scared , i guess .
well , marriage is a scary thing .
i' d be the first one to tell you that .
but once in a while there comes along that special girl .
no , i mean , that' s just it .
she is special .
i just figured ... eventually ... she' il find somebody else .
and , you know , you always hope that next guy will be some loser ... not the president .
handy , on the 16th hole of our match ... you laid up .
yeah .
i remember .
i did .
you played it safe .
so ?
you ended up in the water .
i never would have been president of the united states ... if i' d laid up .
sometimes you just gotta go for the green .
let' s go vote .
out of the way . !
here he is . !
hold them back !
mr. president , over here . !
please , we have some questions . !
good morning , ladies and gentlemen .
please step back .
no comments today .
no questions .
okay , thanks .
thank you .
okay .
please . !
one question . !
kindly walk in over there .
the pageantry of democracy is working .
that' s why we love mooseport so much .
once a politician ...
always a politician .
it' s 10 minutes past the hour ... and there are 20 minutes left before the polls close in mooseport , maine .
with the former president' s campaign spending millions ... on tv , radio and print advertising ... it' s an amazing feat that handy harrison' s grass roots campaign ... still has him neck and neck ...
it was so beautiful .
hello .
oh .
spectacular , isn' t it ?
i was thinking about ...
for once don' t talk , please .
what ?
just listen .
okay ?
can you do that ?
a long while back ... my mom asked me what i saw in you .
you probably find it hard to believe that anybody could ask such a thing ... but she did .
i see a man i admire , " i told her .
a flawed man , certainly , but a man with principles .
since this handy thing ...
i' ve seen a man ... who only cares about ego and power ... a man who will stoop to anything ... to win a position he doesn' t even want ... from someone he probably shouldn' t even beat .
and it angers me , and it upsets me .
oh , and mostly it just makes me sad .
grace ...
because ... you used to be better than that , monroe .
you really were .
and that is no handshake , you son of a bitch .
sugar , mr. president ?
oh , uh , three , please .
no , no , no .
one .
good morning , mr. president .
good morning .
where' s grace ?
i don' t know , sir .
could you find her , please ?
yes , sir .
let' s go .
eagle , we gotta get moving .
they want you down in town for the announcement .
announcement ?
i can' t expose myself to an announcement without knowing who won .
they won' t tell me , eagle .
i' ve done everything short of bribing them ... with a year' s supply of beer and night crawlers ... but i' il get down there and work on it .
get on that toga and get down to that circus , eagle .
please , sir .
sally , um ...
handy . !
you back here ?
uh , hey .
it' s time , man .
yeah , i know .
don' t you want to find out if you won or lost ... badly ?
i' m gonna ...
yeah , go ahead .
no , i' il wait for ya .
i' m gonna meet you there .
i want to .
no , go .
you' re my ride , man .
come on !
okay .
all right .
let' s go .
in a few moments ...
former president cole and harold " handy " harrison are due to arrive .
will big politics and big money carry the day , or will the little man prevail ?
we shall soon see .
testing . !
testing , testing . !
we' re just about ready to start .
and , uh ...
ah !
i think i see the president coming now !
whoo hoo !

i didn' t say it , but yes ...
i didn' t ...
you know , there' s no ...
i didn' t make a word thing out of it , but you can' t even measure it .

you could take the heat from that sun , and you ...
if you put all of that in a love container , you' d ...
