why are you here ?
i let you touch me , cowboy .
i think i need a bath .
samantha , please .
who' s samantha ?
where' s henessey ?
no one told me about her
the way she lied
well , no one told me about her
how many people cried
but it' s too late to say you' re sorry
how would i know ?
why should i care ?
please don' t bother trying to find her
she' s not there
well , let me tell you about the way she looks
the way she acted , the colour of her hair
her voice was soft and cool , her eyes were clear and bright
but she' s not there
the lengthening of its neck , it' s easier for it to swim .
its front feet are a little bit larger , and that' s good , to have these paddlelike feet .
hey , sister , oh , sister , soul sister , go , sister
hey , sister , go , sister , soul sister , go , sister
we met marmalade down in old new orleans ...
hey , mitch !
you' re awake .
hey , joe , you want to give it a go ?
yitti yitti ya ya da da
uh oh .
you' re seeping .
here .
look at this .
ow !
shit !
ohh !
ow .
that hurt like shit .
i know .
that' s why i distracted you first .
the same principle as deflowering virgins .
what ?
v virg ...
what ?
i read it in this harold robbins book .
a guy bites her on the ear , distracts from the pain .
you ever try that ?
no .
i sock them in the jaw and yell , " pop goes the weasel " .
who the fuck are you ?
the name' s charly .
the spy .
nice to meet you .
drink ?
yeah .
there have been gunshots , and yes ...
ok .
let' s say i buy it .
you are a trained killer .
i can' t even say that with a straight face .
so samantha ... she ...
never really existed .
like nathan said , she was a total fabrication .
i made her up .
so now she' s just , uh , gone forever and ever ?
thank god .
look at my inordinately large ass .
look what she did to me .
pretty convincing act .
i guess .
you know , her personality had to come from somewhere .
change the subject .
better yet , bring me that bottle .
here you go .
drink up .
so , what' s next ?
what do we do now ?
i contact chapter .
i come for debriefing , bury the last 8 years , get back to work .
cheers .
would you believe it , harry ?
we got an appropriations review in three weeks , and the president wants to know how i managed to lose an agent .
yes , sir .
you have a call on line 3 , sir .
you going to tell me who it is ?
charly baltimore , sir .
run a trace .
this is mr perkins .
turn on the tv .
farmon , new jersey .
seven dead .
charly !
good lord , girl .
we' ve been looking all over for you .
i got a photo of you in a christmas parade .
what the hell is happening ?
don' t be stupid .
i completed my assignment .
you mean daedalus ?
i shot him .
he' s pretty much dead .
actually , i would have done it earlier , like back in ' 92 , but i was baking .
don' t ask .
i want to come in .
sure .
of course .
let me direct you to a safe house .
forget it .
we play it my way .
you want me back , then you stay away .
i' il call you .
those are the rules , understand ?
shit .
did you hear that ?
if she got to daedalus , she could know about honeymoon .
she might know that old targets have become your new best friends .
that could be trouble .
god damn you .
there were weapons at that farm .
she' s armed now !
stop having kittens .
you' re the head of a major spy network , and you have a tendency to whine .
do you realise that ?
she could compromise this entire operation .
we have 24 hours .
we find her ... then we kill her .
you do whatever it takes , but you be careful .
if it gets out you' re working for me ,
i' m going to be grabbing my ankles on the white house lawn .
the lady' s whacked , trin .
she' s lost it .
i got to get out of here .
i need you to meet me .
i' il sneak out to this phone and call you at midnight with the details , all right ?
bye .
all right , sam .
what did that accomplish ?
i' m testing our boy perkins .
got a light ?
i don' t really trust him .
come again ?
a little experiment .
if he was looking for me in pennsylvania , he sure as hell tapped your office .
you mean , he just traced that call ?
come midnight , you hang by the phone .
if he wants to erase me , he' il send someone to kidnap and torture you for my whereabouts , in which case , i don' t trust him .
no , no , no .
time out .
well , hello there
my , it' s been a long , long time
i haven' t had a date in eight years , mitch .
is this a fun date ?
oh , i guess i' m doing fine
what' s going on ?
true love .
shut the fuck up .
when beautiful ... white ladies seduce someone , call in help .
get real , sweetheart .
i ain' t handsome , i ain' t rich , and the last time i got blown , candy bars cost a nickel .
what' s going on ?
chemistry .
chemistry , my ass .
you know what i think ?
i think this is why you' d fuck me .
to kill a schoolteacher .
to bury her once and for all .
i kind of liked that schoolteacher .
when she comes back , you give me a call , all right ?
and call your fucking kid .
it' s two days to christmas .
she might be under the mistaken impression mommy gives a fuck .
i didn' t ask for the kid .
samantha had the kid , not me !
nobody asked me !
was born upon this day
to save us all from satan' s power
oh , tidings of comfort ...
good evening , pretty lady .
how about some company ?
no , thanks .
i' m saving myself till i get raped .
step in the alley .
i ain' t asking you .
i' m telling you .
fuck .
god damn it .
you' re early .
so perkins wants me dead , huh ?
what' s the rush ?
why don' t you just go away and come back at midnight ?
shoo .
hey , honey , this is a real big fucking gun .
this ain' t no ham on rye , pal .
what the hell are you doing ?
saving your life .
i would have been here sooner , but i was thinking up that ham on rye line .
you think i can' t take him ?
now you scared the other ones away .
what other ones ?
head hunters , nimrod .
they don' t travel alone .
were you always this stupid , or did you take lessons ?
i took lessons .

why ?
easy , sport .
i got myself out of beirut once .
i think i can get out of new jersey .
yeah ?
don' t be so sure .
others have tried and failed .
the entire population , in fact .
you keep saying " i " this , " i " that , like , well ...
it' s like you don' t need me any more .

he' s got the kid .
timothy ?
he' s routing me to a land line .
he doesn' t want to talk over the airwaves .
oh , shit !
maybe we can trace him .
trace him ?
how ?
it' s a random hotel .
how long did he give you ?
15 minutes .
fuck .
why don' t we try the phone company ?

nobody move !

you' ve got 40 seconds to run a patch for me .

holiday inn .
jet speaking .
i' d like to page charlene baltimore , please .

i got it off the cast on her right wrist , right below " mommy loves you " .
i offer up a simple trade : you for the girl .
i' il tell you where and when .
and , charly , you fuck with me ...
i' il blind the kid and shoot out her knees .
give me an a. n. i. trace .
do it !
how do you know so much about this timothy character ?
what do you think ?
i bumped pelvises with him .
he was a target , remember ?
ma' am ?
that call was placed from niagara falls .
niagara falls ?
operation honeymoon .
bingo .
perkins .
what' s he doing here ?
timothy acting alone , we had a chance .
charly' s hooked .
all we got to do is set a time and a place .
my god .
we' re monsters .
you talk to me about honeymoon .
tanker' s ready .
one terrorist on ice waiting to play patsy .
and no loose ends ?
no .
no .
not that i can tell .
the feds are going to find them crashed in a ravine five miles from the blast site .
i' m not a complete ogre .
the young one gets a doll to play with for christmas .
oh , fuck you .
i think i should go in first .
negative .
you' d just screw it up .
hey , i' m a much better shot up close .
you couldn' t hit a lake if you were standing on the bottom .
forget it .
here .
the guards are at 126 . 9 megahertz .
you meet me ... at 127 . 1 if you need to talk .
as soon as you spot me with the kid , you start laying down cover fire .
all right .
they' re going to blow my head off , you know .
this is the last time i' il ever be pretty .
northeast sector , all clear .
roger , northeast .
bogey .
round her up , gentlemen .

i got plenty of matches up here .
it would be a bad way for a kid to go .
30 seconds .
think it over .
pick him up .
i' m going to miss you , major .
you ought really to have stayed dead .
you don' t know the rules of the game any more .
tell me about it .
eight years ago , this guy was on the hit list .
budget cuts , dear .
congress blinded us overseas .
i was forced to turn to any eyes and ears i could find , even if that meant recruiting the " bad guys " here .
budget cuts , is that what this is about ?
operation honeymoon ...
fuck me !
you' re running a fund raiser .
fund raiser ?
1993 ...
world trade center bombing , remember ?
during the trial , one of the bombers claimed the cla had advance knowledge .
the diplomat who issued the terrorists ' visa was cla .
it' s not unthinkable they paved the way for the bombing , purely to justify a budget increase .
you' re telling me you' re going to fake some terrorist thing just to scare some money out of congress ?
unfortunately , mr henessey ,
i have no idea how to fake killing 4, 000 people , so we' re just going to have to do it for real . it on the muslims ,
then i get my funding .
good night , old girl .
timothy , i' il be in chopper one .
no , no , no .
just her .
sam .
i' il be waiting for you to come rescue me .

come on .
i' m going to die .
i want to know .
ok .
chemical bomb .
chain reaction .
once started , it can' t be stopped .
the catalyst injected into the tanker heats up .
we pull the truck into the centre of town .
it goes critical around midnight .
farewell .
adieu .
bang .
timothy .
yeah ?

i' m about all out of favours , there , chuck .

you' re just going to be written off as some crazy mommy who kidnapped her own kid , died with her in a blizzard .
god damn you .
look at her eyes .

because they' re yours .

joining us tonight is cla section chief walter hodge .
he' s in langley , virginia .
at our studios in new york city , intelligence analyst jack e. wadsworth .
and in our studios here tonight is pittsburgh native mitchell henessey , who , at a surprise press conference , was singled out by the president of the united states for his role in this affair .
as the expression goes , " that ain' t hay " .
hello , mitch , and thanks for coming .
thank you , mr king , for having me .
mitch , you have had one hell of a christmas eve , and we have heard from our reporter carla krebs , on the scene in niagara falls , that when she first heard this story , she didn' t believe it .
well , what carla failed to realise , mr king , is that i' m always frank and earnest with women .
in new york , i' m frank .
in chicago , i' m earnest !
