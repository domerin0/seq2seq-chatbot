vidocq makes his own police corps
vidocq and nimier intelligence agency
loser !
what' s up ?
what do u want ?
goodafternoon .
etienne boisset .
journalist .
no drolers here .
i am not just a journalist .
i write about vidocq .
i am his official biographer .
what is so funny ?
he did not need anyone to write his memoirs .
if somebody writes something ... i am the first to know .
i am nimier , his partner .
do u understand ?
give me a moment , i will show u something .
look .
vidocq wrote me .
he was expecting me .
i swear it .
he was going to re read it .
look .
don' t u know it ?
vidocq is dead .
yes , exactly .
why , exactly ?
what do u want ?
i want to fpinish my book .
i must find the murderer .
the murderer of vidocq .
poor fellow .
i must find his murderer .
then its more than just an biograpy .
it will be revenge .
his revenge .
disappear .
go away !
than i can forget you .
help me .
tell me what you know .
you were doing an investigation ?
both of you ?
aren' t you doing anything ?
who killed him , is as good as dead !
i can help you .
tell me what happened .
then it' il become more clear .
tell me how did it started .
it began one week ago , with two rich people .
belmont and veraldi .
thay is nonsence .
it is not because they were hit by lightning ...
one men hit by lightning is an accident .
two men hit by lightning is a plot .
certainly if it are belmont en veraldi .
who are they ?
belmont was the most important weapenmanufacturer of france .
veraldi was a chemist .
he makes explosives of it .
so what ?
it is an heavy battle for our army .
we cannot have a weak spot now .
certainly not now .
what do you fear ?
an attack from the germans ?
they put you on the throne .
i fear an attack from the inside .
the reformations are not populair .
not really .
paris is full of conspiricy .
orleanisten , bonapartisten , republicans .
even i do not know .
i don' t do politics .
my people have their hands full .
that with the lightning , goes to far . you have to investigate this .
you fired me .
can' t you remember ?
no , it is not possible .
too much work .
don' t you understand ?
the monarchy is threatened .
i expect a new attack with the next lightning .
pay .
i will think about it .
is ethic a strange thing for you ?
you' re hiding your talents .
whose fault is that ?
do not forget it .
you have until the next lighting .
napoleon made all clocks melt to cannons .
there were never enough .
the workplaces where built in churches .
like us .
this is a good place .
very close to the lord .
yes , but not for long anymore .
why ?
what a question .
only belmont was aquainted with the secrets of irrigating .
do you have an idea about his dead ?
that is the big theatre of life .
belmont was successfull because of the fire .
he died because of the fire .
youre boss never left without his body guards .
he did not only feared ghosts , he ?
yes , he was afraid for a long time .
did he do strange business ?
a fairer person then him didn' t exist .
he had some bad things , the bourgeois ... but he deserves that we make a toast on him .
which bad things ?
well , i will tell you .
belmont ...
what do you mean ?
he was like a painter , if you like .
but his paintings , were himself .
was he married ?
yes . with his belly button .
what happend ?
nothing abnormal .
a burning beggar .
we made powder .
our jackets are full of it .
wait .
when the lightning strucked belmont ... he began to burn like a torch .
maybe there was some powder on his jacket .
come on .
those jackets where cleaned by the wash woman .
it would be incredibly careless .
do not forget me on your list of suspects .
a canon that exploded , in austerlitz .
a small technical failure .
thank you , sir belmont .
a lovely woman ...
hurry .
think of the next lightning . come on !
it will be fast .
the clothes of belmont ?
the little african will take care of it .
gandin .
where is gandin ?
he is ironing .
we will call him .
gandin !
are you gandin ?
i did not do anything wrong .
are you him or not ?
did you cleaned his jacket on the day belmont died ?
i did not do anything wrong .
did you do it or not ?
i am innocent .
did you do it or not ?
i' m gonna ironon your mouth !
stop that , goddamnit !
excuse me .
its because of the ros .
did you cleaned his jacket ?
no .
why not ?
they told me not to clean it .
who told you ?
who ?
i saw an centrifuge .
no !
i got a letter ...
so you can read ?
no , no .
the clothes of belmont and veraldi did not have to be cleaned anymore .
where did the letter came from ?
no idea .
there was money included .
they where grilled .
i could not know it .
asshole !
i swear .
i did not have any choice .
why ?
the letter .
it was an order .
an order from the devil himself .
nonsence !
i swear .
i swear .
it was written with blood .
i think lightning can be aimed at a target .
to catch the lightning you need a lightning .... and to send the energy it must be aimable .
also there must be , and that is the conditio sine qua non ... a metal element being present on the target .
there .
protect your eyes .
easy .
the metall , everything is there .
the cosmical fire that hits everything deep within one second .
but there is no fire .
anvictim of lightning can not burn .
some of them even come out without any injuries .
the lightning was just a spark .
it reminds me of the prison and the stoneoven .
forget that .
sure .
what are you looking for ?
they were set up .
they were accurate prepared .
and what else ?? what else ??
if there where bombs , there must have been some sort of fuse .
what was there in the hat ?
in the hat , what was in it ?
an comb .
a what ?
an golden comb .
a decoration for woman .
it attracts the lightning .
what kind of comb was it ?
a chinese comb .
a devil with a head of a monkey .
a devil ...
and what where you doing then ?
i ?
nothing .
vidocq went on with it alone .
why ?
i don' t know .
maybe it was the iron .
i became to sensitive .
what did he do afterwards ?
give me an trail .
i should have found him .
i could have avoided it .
goddamnit .
i had him ...
okay .
i will be back .
we are not getting anywhere , sir .
they saw vidocq arrive .
they don' t know why .
and the wel ?
why exactly did he go there ?
nobody knows .
continue with the investigation .
they' re hiding something .
who informed the newspapers ?
i want to know that too .
damnit , tauzet , this way we are making fools of ourselfs ?
i did not see the corpse yet .
the corpse ?
the corpse of vidocq .
what do you think ?
that i' ve never seen a corps before ?
can i speak with you ?
not now .
okay .
and talk about vidocq , is that possible ?
louis belmont , simon veraldi , can there be spoken of ?
you are the only from paris who wears such a decoraction .
i do not know where you are talking about .
you killed belmont and veraldi .
i have prove .
you are it !
the murderer with the lightning !
okay .
i am the murderer with the lighting .
who are you ?
i am etienne boisset .
a journalist .
i investigate the dead of vidocq .
you are not asian .
you are very perceptive .
and talkative .
the coams for my story .
why ?
i tell you what i know and you give them back .
okay ?
no , they are evidence .
they are accusing you of murder .
do i look like a monster to you ?
i' m listening .
franois , you know me .
you can' t accuse me of ...
didn' t you put them on their hats ?
preah , damned .
what happened with you ?
i can' t cover you very long .
i pushed my co worker aside , but ...
two weaks ago i received a letter with money .
i had to put the coam in the hat of belmont and then in in the hat of veraldi .
i did what they asked .
i don' t know who payed .
and you didn' t wonder why ?
i thought that people were setting them up .
why not ?
they were rich clients .
and the letters weren' t threatening ?
threatening ?
were they written in blood ?
no .
they were parfumed .
elegantly written .
i even thought of a woman .
do you still have them ?
have what ?
preah , who is next on the list ?
who says that there is still a coam ?
heaven .
tell me who' s next .
ernest laffite , the director of the hotel of lnvalids .
wait .
i' m coming with you .
what are you doing ?
leave me alone .
i work for the prefect .
alright .
what did you do on the roof ?
nothing .
i thought i saw a shadow .
i' m taking her home .
she is ill .
here .
the other two ?
personal archive .
it isn' t a political scheme .
belmont and veraldi , that' s possible , but not laffite .
that they are weapons suppliers , is a coincidence .
they died for the same reason .
revenge .
a revenge .
well planned .
and the game with the lightning ...
that sounds like a kind of heavenly justice .
but you have also seen the killer .
and the pigeons .
did you see how he dissapearred in his cloak ?
a magic trick .
magic , give me a break .
and the mask ?
also fits with revenge .
i don' t think so .
a mirror .
almost like the men had to see themselves .
you' re talking nonsense .
i knew them well .
they were weird , but harmless .
weird ?
what do you mean by weird ?
is that everything you did ?
they never touched me .
what ?
you mean they loved other men ?
they loved their appearance , their body ... their own face .
they loved themselves .
is that the reason they died ?
no idea .
that' s what vidocq thought .
he thought there was more to it .
that they knew too much .
certainly .
dandy' s that dressed up .
the lightning .
a mirrormask .
it can be more easy .
where did he went to ?
vidocq .
no idea .
but i do know that he died because of me .
no , he died because of the investigation .
no .
hij worked alone .
to protect me .
that' s why he' s dead .
did you know him for a long time ?
mister police officer , we shall see if you' re good .
find the opening in my rug .
the secret of the khmer dancers .
it' s being made on the body .
without buttons or needles .
what kind ...
how was your relationship ?
professional .
we had a professional relationship .
good .
there you go .
is that a joke ?
tomorrow , same time .
we are wondering where you' re from .
from santer .
never heard of it .
a small village in the provence .
did you meet vidocq ?
no , i wrote him .
he agreed to go through parts of his biography .
biography ?
more then just a biography .
a real book .
a massive book about vidocq .
i have to find the killer for my last chapter .
this is how i can avenge vidocq .
do you admire him ?
i know everything about him .
how he escaped .
how he joined the police force .
how he aprehended hundreds of criminals .
he was no angel .
don' t try to put him down .
he rat on his friends to join the police force .
everyone knows that .
it' s in my book .
vidocq wanted to catch gangsters , using every means if necessery .
he thought differently .
he felt guilty .
that gave him strength .
that lead him to this investigation .
he was convinced that everybody had a secret side .
that' s why those three men died .
you didn' t say everything .
where did he go after the hotel ?
forget it .
you can' t handle it .
tell me what you know !
he thought they were perverts .
he wanted to pursue that lead .
he wanted to go , there where was crime .
the neighborhood around the prison .
thank you , preah .
thank you .
how is our investigation going ?
someone is missing sir .
de chief of the glas blowers .
he appears to be gone .
he' s hiding .
and the others are covering for him .
i knew it .
he saw something and he' s trying to hide himself
he' s terrified .
what' s wrong ?
nothing .
nothing .
find him before tomorrow morning .
don' t worry .
don' t worry ?
belmont , veraldi and laffite are dead .
and vidocq , our best researcher , as well .
the best .
and you tell me not to worry ?
sir ...
it' s enough !
paris is on the edge of a revolution .
the facturies in belmont have stopped .
nobody is producing weapons anymore .
if they are political murders , why kill laffite , a doctor ?
that' s part of their plan .
their diabolical plan .
guard the area around the prison .
if the smallest thing happens u check it out .
and you are going back to the factory .
question the workers again .
i' m sure that there is something to find .
come on !
i' m coming as well .
minister polignac is here .
i have to stay .
come on !
sylvia , the boss .
what could pleasure the young man ?
the fire of zanzibar ?
the salt of gurande ?
the wind of the desert ?
no , excuse me , i don' t want a girl .
i' m investigating the death of vidocq .
the holy virgin maria .
he rests in peace .
u knew him , didn' t you ?
he was more then a customer .
a friend .
i want to know who killed him .
who doesn' t ?
i want to get to the bottom of this .
that is hell .
hell .
three men interested him .
belmont , laffite and veraldi .
customers of you ?
no .
the house didn' t have the products they were interested in .
products that were very rare .
products ?
which products ?
virgins .
young virgins .
pure beings , as they called them .
to do what ?
what do you think ?
i don' t believe you .
those bastards went to the poor .
they bought their children .
that isn' t missing here .
i don' t believe you .
you bore me .
go to the furet , the paper .
two blocks ahead .
ask for froissard .
he knows everything about it .
the furet .
froissard .
journalist .
understood ?
yes .
thank you .

vidocq and i were on the same track .
what track ?
the factory .
the glassfactory ?
yes .
and the connection with the lightning ?
the murders ?
and the virgins ?
trade secrets .
i went there when he died .
that' s why i publiciced it first .
froissard , the fastest writer in paris .

it' s not a competition .
it' s about murder .
everything okay ?
yes , i give advice to the new guy .
it isn' t the right time .
we need you .

it' s okay .
i' il come .
i know why you didn' t warn the police .
you don' t have anything concrete .
facts .
bits and pieces .
i have witnesses .
drunks .
alcoholics .
i have a first class whitness .
who ?
myself .
i would like to become a monk , but there was an orgie being prepared .
i don' t believe you .

marine lafitte ?
the doctors wife .

don' t look .
she can' t talk anymore .
is she dead ?
almost .
opium , my boy .

don' t search .
you can' t handle it .
are you forming some kind of conspiracy ?

or they are very affraid .
i have spoken with polignac .
karel x abolishes the freedom of the press and the representatives .

what do we have to expect ?
revolt .
the civilians will come on the street and we' il have to lock ourselves up somewhere ... in our own dungeons and wait for backup .
let them go .
too bad for the witness .
we komen niets meer te weten .
and the guards in the neighbourhood of the prison ?
and the control ?
we give up .
tommorow whe have other cats to meet .
a comment ...
what ?
kids out of the glassblazery talked about something weirds .
something that comes back al the time ...
wel ?
they talk about some kind of monster in de glassblazery .
a ghost .
a creature with a mirror instead of the face .
doesn' t that ring a bell ?
weird .
a legend in the neigbourhood .
something to scare people off or something .
when there was a crime , it was always that creature .
pure superstition .
is that everything ?
i thought ...
maybe we' ve always been on the wrong track .
maybe that creature has something to do with the murders , with vidocq .
are you crazy ?
do you belive in ghosts ?
go to sleep , m. tauzet .
i don' t have to trace that spur ?
go to sleep .
within several hours it won' t be ghosts who will attack .
marine laffite ?
are you marine laffite ? what do you want ? i don' t have time for courtesy .
i am a reporter .
i investigate the murder of vidocq .
vidocq was killed ...
why do you laugh ?
because it is my fault .
why ?
don' t you get it ?
don' t you get it that it was me who drove him in the arm' s of the monster ?
which monster ?
tell me .
when did you see vidocq ?
two day' s ago .
in my salon . say it .
do you want to die ?
i want to know what happened
first my dosis no
who' s in charge here ?
they' re coming .. they' re coming
tell .
everything has started with ernest .
and his rage .
the rage of somebody who loves himself .
and who doesn' t want to get old .
that' s also a way to intepretate it .
your husband was a dandy and perverse .
he dealt in virgins .
silence .
you don' t know anything .
ernest took care of his looks like a piece of art .
he saw himself as a piece of art
but the age did his job .
he didn' t talk about anything else .
he didn' t saw me standing anymore .
only his wrimpels and skin were important .
all those things which destroyed him .
and every night he saw the other two
belmont and veraldi ?
one night i followed him
with this our skin will look better .
that' s wht you told me last time .
what do you think to win by doing this ?
time in time ?
some bewitched powder .
and your youth comes back ?
i' ve got a proposition .
what can u offer us ?
what you' re looking for ?
eternal youth .
what ?
the lifeelixir .
bullshit .
nobody has that kind of power .
nobody , except for me .
what do you want in return for it ?
i need some sort of material .
deliver it to me and you will get the elixir
what kind of material ?
virgins .
young virgins .
pure creatures .
did they bought them for that ?
why else ?
it was nothing sexual ?
something sexual ?
they passed that stage .
i know it for sure .
no , it not the beauty the elegance .
a work that has to escape from time
but who was the man with the mask ?
the alchemyest .
who ?
the alchemyest .
he is wandering in the neighbourhood of the prison
and trough the mirror he sucks up his victims .
don' t laugh , don' t laugh .
he has the life elixir .
that' s for sure .
and he needed virgins for the elixir .
that poison has affected your memory .
i don' t know why i listen .
because you are affraid .
just like me .
just like ernest .
like everybody .
you are delirious .
be carefull .
when your mirror disappears , you' re lost .
your soul is lost .
you are crazy .
weeks went by .
ernest and the other two kept supplying virgins .
they dried them .
i wanted it to stop .
yes , i wanted it .
but the opium was to strong .
stronger than everything else .
ernest was ripped by remorse .
on a night he said that it was enough .
eight deliveries and still no elixir .
you lied .
you have no secret , no elixir .
noting .
you are ... evil itself .
more .
i need more .
no .
it is enough .
i need more .
that night he told me everything .
he didn' t deliver girls anymore .
that is why the alchemyest killed him ?
after belmont and veraldi it was his turn .
you said that to vidocq ?
yes .
what did he do ?
why doesn' t he come ?
what did vidocq ?
what did he do ?
he took our horses .
why ?
he thought the horses knew the way to the lab
knew ?
why ?
anser .
answer .
8 deliveries .
can' t you count ?
the horses knew the way .
where is the lab ?
where is it ?
go away .
let me do it .
where is it ?
answer me .
if i knew , i was dead already .
i' m almost done .
religion , rumors , superstition .
a legend .
one of the oldest legends .
the alchimist would be a murdered and a scholar .
all non solved crimes were commited by him .
some say he doesn' t have a face , others say he has all faces .
others call his face a mirror that sucks up souls .
who see' s himself in the mask , loses his soul .
who see' s himself in the mask , loses his soul .
open up .
i have to talk to you , sir .
what are you doing here ?
etienne boisset .
biograph of vidocq .
i' m investigating his death .
that is the best .
get that man .
tell us what you are doing here .
my men talked about someone like you .
a man who walked on the street .
sir , look .
what did i told you ?
vidocq researched the alchemyest .
damned .
he exist .
it is no legend .
i' il explain .
it is clear . verry clear .
vidocq chased the alchemyest ... and the alchemyest pushed him in the pit .
maybe ...
what ells ?
laten we de zaken nog eens op een rij zetten .
imagine that the alchemyest is the one behind the lightning .
and that the alchemyest is vidocq himself .
i don' t understand it .
the lightning , the murders , the mask .
didn' t somebody else commited that before ?
and that also explains these instruments ... and the mask here , not ?
and vidocq himself fell in the pit ?
listen .
or he setted up his own dead .
whe only found a pile of ashes .
it is a bautifull end for a manipulating villan ?
allow me , sir , but that sounds ... to complicated .
listen .
listen .
vidocq and the alchemyest are two different persons .
i' ve got prove .
it seems he knows his case well .
which prove ?
let me go .
vidocq battled with the alchemyest when laffite died .
i have a witness .
and all those instruments ?
vidocq is a scientist .
he worked on a paper formula .
and that ? ls that for the decoration ?
who says the alchemyest is one person ?
you are crazy .
there can be two thiefs behind the mask .
vidocq and the other monster .
nimier for example .
you are crazy .
no , nevermind .
it' s alright .
do you take ... ? prove .
take it easy okay ?
and calm down now .
what does this has to mean ?
where do you come from ?
he carries a mirror , doesn' t he ?
on the place of his face there is a mirror .
how did you escaped ?
how ?
what did he do ?
what does he do with de girls ?
what does he do ?
where is his lab ?
where is his lab ?
what dirty tricks .
bastard .
i know the secret of the monster .
the mirror is alive .
the mask is an energiereceptor ...
some kind of pump .
the alchemyest steals the souls ... on the moment that he killes his fictem .
he locks them up trough his mask ... and he feeds himself with it so he doen' t get older .
the achemyest uses the virginity blood ... for the glass of the mirror .
it is the pureness of the blood ... that gives him life .
if i' m right , i know where he is .
the killer doesn' t make the mask himself , only the material .
hij has an accomplice .
a glasscraftsman .
i know where he is .
in the glassblazery of the arsenal .
and , asshole ?
working ?
where did you get that ?
and always snuffling around ?
atleast i' m searching .
and me ?
you think i did nothing ?
i started all over .
calm down .
i started all over .
what does that change ?
what do you know that i don' t know ?
i know why vidocq was in the blazery .
i know who he was chaseing .
and what his goal was .
do you talk about the alchemyest ?
you are behind .
now you have to find his accomplicee .
do you meen the glassblowers ?
yes .
he saw everything .
he was there when vidocq died .
what ?
tonight i talked with the blowers .
i knew they where hiding someone .
and they understood that they had to talk . in exchange for my protection .
is he going to tell everything ?
he doesen' t have a choice .
it is me or the algemyest .
are you going there ?
you understand everything .
take me with you .
you want to go with us ?
take me with you .
i also want to nail the alchemyest .
also i want to revenge vidocq .
we are going .
where to ?
where nobody is looking yet .
in the glassblazery .
with froissard with us we' re with two .
and that dork is always to fast for us .
and the alchemyest , who killed al the witnesses , is following him .
it is almost his turn .
and we' il lose him .
no , my lord .
i know where he is .
with nimier .
they have found the blower .
it is time for the truth .
put this on .
for the gasses .
we used poisened material .
tell everything that you saw .
don' t be afraid .
they are here to protect you .
he said he was looking for the devil .
but he was it himself .
he wants a new mask .
he brought the materials .
when does he come back ?
when ?
he is here .
what ?
in the coolchamber .
the mask is done .
he must be there .
i may not enter there if he ...
wait !
if i must die , i want to see your face .
vidocq dying voluntary ?
impossible .
i swear that i saw that .
when he saw his face , he threw himself in the well .
did you see his face ?
no , i only saw his back .
damned , all that for nothing .
this was my last change .
police officer .
you haven' t lost anything .
nobody know' s anything .
nobody saw anything .
nobody will ever know who the algemyest is .
is that so ?
i want to see your face .
it is not because of your face that i let you go .
it is cause of what i saw in the mask .
when they pulled me out , i was supposed to be dead .
death for everybody .
they' d hidden me and took care of me .
