change ain' t good , leon .
you know ?
check it .
make sure it' s the right thing .
i trustyou .
one thing' s got nothin ' to do with the other .
remember that .
i will .
the rifle is the first weapon you learn how to use ... because it lets you keepyour distance from the client .
the closeryou get to being a pro ... the closeryou can get to the client .
the knife , for example , is the last thing you learn .
position .
never take it offuntil the last minute .
it reflects light .
they can seeyou coming from a mile away .
and always dress down .
never brighter than the floor , okay ?
let' s practice now .
it' s the best way to learn .
who should i hit ?
whoever .
i' il be with you in a second .
give me a few minutes .
thankyou .
you guys get lost .
i don' t want to seeyou .
is everyone in position ?
this has to look natural .
no women , no kids .
right ?
right .
jogger in theyellow and orange ?
keep calm .
don' t takeyour eyes offhim .
breathe easy .
watch his movement .
pretend you' re running with him .
try to feel his next movement .
take a deep breath .
hold it .
now .
oh , my god !
i' m all right .
i' m fine .
get down !
where' d that come from ?
one shot .
not bad , huh ?
who the hell fired ?
i just can' t breathe !
get offme .
can we try with real bullets now ?
not today .
let' s pack up .
like that .
no , thanks .
no discussion .
it seemed ... to socrates

it' s been a long time , leon .
i missed you .

training' s good , but don' t overdo it .
training don' t pay as good as working , leon .
tony ... all the money i make , thatyou keep for me
you need some money ?
just curious .
i' ve been working a long time ... and i haven' t done anything with my money .
i thought maybe someday i could use it .
you met a woman .
you gotta be careful with women .
rememberwhen you arrived in this country ?
when i tookyou in , you were still wet behind the fuckin ' ears ... and , already , you were in deep shit because ofa woman .
don' t forget that , leon .
i wish i could sometimes .
you know , about my money
maybe i could give ... a little ... to someone .
you know , to help out .
it' s your money .
i' m just holding it foryou , like a bank .
except better than a bank because banks always get knocked off .
no one knocks offold tony .
besides , with a bank ... there' s always tons offorms and all that shit .
but old tony , nothin ' to read , nothin ' to write .
it' s all in his head .
i know how to read now .
that' s good , leon .
your money' s here .
wheneveryou want it , youjust ask me .
here' s a grand .
come on .
it' s okay .
i don' t need it .

he looks like a weirdo .
i' il be out in five minutes .

in my stomach .
it' s all warm .
i always had a knot there , and now it' s gone .
mathilda , i' m glad you don' t have a stomachache anymore .

when you stop , you pay .
it' s the law .

i do business for myself .
so this is something ... personal , is it ?
what filthy piece ofshit ... did i do now ?
you killed my brother .
i' m sorry .

it' s always the same thing .
it' s when you start to become really afraid ofdeath ... thatyou learn to appreciate life .
doyou like life , sweetheart ?
that' s good .
because i take no pleasure ... in taking a life ... ifit' s from a person who doesn' t care about it .
stan , i' ve been looking all over foryou .

is that whatyou call " i won' t be long " ?
i been here for ten minutes .
i did my best .
doyou like it ?
yes .
so say it .
i like it .
not thirsty ?
you know , a girl' s first time is very important .
it determines the rest ofher life sexually .
i read that once in one ofmy sister' s magazines .
my girlfriends told me they hated their first experience .
that' s because they didn' t love the guys .
theyjust did it to show off .
afterwards , they started liking it , like cigarettes .
will i like it the first time ?
mathilda , no .
why not ?
i just can' t .
you love someone else ?
no .
i mean
there was someone a long time ago .
before i came to the states .
her father didn' t want her to see me .
she was from a very respectable family .
mine was ... you know ... not so respectable .
her dad went nuts every time she' d take offto see me .
she still snuck off to seeyou , right ?
right .
see , nothing can stop love , leon .
he killed her .
one shot through the head .
they kept him injail for two days , and they let him go free .
they said it was an accident .
so ... one night i ... waited for him .
five hundred feet with a lens .
he also had an accident .
the same night i took a boat and came here ... to meet up with my father who was working fortony .
i was 1 9 .
since then i' ve never left the city , and ...
i' ve never had another girlfriend .
you see , mathilda ...
i wouldn' t be a good lover .
okay .
would you do me one favor ?
what ?
i' m sick ofwatching you sleep on your chair .
we' re gonna share the bed .
i don' t think it' s a good idea .
it' s okay .
putyour legs up on the bed .
yeah .
that' s nice .
putyour head down .
it' s okay .
relax .
good night , leon .
good night .
i want a piece ofcake first !
manolo , take the kids in the kitchen .
i have a lot ofrespect foryour business , tony .
when you' ve killed for us in the past ... we' ve always been satisfied .
that' s exactlywhy today is going to be very hard for me .
i hopeyou' il excuse my mood .
my man was killed right here on your turf .
the chinks tell me that the hit man ... was kind ofthe italian type .
so we figured that tony might know something .
wait .
there' s more .
you' re gonna love this .
a few hours later , a little 1 2 year old girl comes into my office ... armed to the teeth , with the firm intention ofsending me to the morgue .
doyou know who came and got her right there in my building ?
the very same ...
italian hit man .
i' m dying to meet him .
relax .
everything' s fine .
sleep well ?
i never really sleep .
got one eye open always .
yeah , i forgot .
i never saw someone with one eye open snore so much .
i snore ?
like a baby .
i' m gonna get some milk for breakfast .
i won' t be long .
don' t forget the code when you come back .
two knocks , then one , and two knocks again .

leon asked me to helpyou out ... ifsomethin ' happened , and i think somethin ' happened .
he put aside a little cash foryou .
so what i' m suggesting is that ... seein ' as how you' re still soyoung ...
i should hold the money foryou until you' re older .
like a bank , you know , except ... it' s better than a bank ' cause banks always get knocked off .
no one knocks offold tony .
but it' s your money .
in the meantime ... all you gotta do is come here every once in awhile ... and i' il dish it out soyou can have a little fun .
here .
here' s a hundred bucks to start .
can' t i get ajob instead ?
ajob ?
what the hell can you do ?
i can clean .
i ain' t got no work for a 1 2 year old kid ... so get it out ofyour goddamn head !
it' s over !
the game' s over !
leon' s dead !
you hear me ?
come on .
you think i ain' t hurtin ' too ?
but he' s dead .
you' re gonna forget all this craziness and getyour little ass back to school .
now take this money and get the hell outta here .
don' t let me seeyour face till next month ...
' cause something tells me i' m about to lose my famous kind streak .
my parents ... died ... in a car accident fourweeks ago .
it was terrible .
we didn' t have the time to get to know one anotherwhen you first came here ... but i wantyou to know i' m not the kind ofwoman who' d let down a child ... whatever her situation , whatever her mistake .
so i' m going to helpyou and do my best to welcomeyou here again .
you have to stop lying to me , mathilda .
i wantyou to take a chance ... and trust me .
tell me what happened toyou .
my family got shot down by d. e. a. officers ... because ofa drug problem .
i left with the greatest guy on earth .
he was a hit man , the best in town , but he died this morning .
ifyou don' t help me , i' il be dead by tonight .
you know her ?
i' ve never seen her .
i thinkwe' il be okay here .
