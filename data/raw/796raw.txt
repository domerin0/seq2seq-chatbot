there was a time , a time before cable , when the local anchorman reigned supreme ,
when people believed everything they heard on tv .
this was an age when only men were allowed to read the news .
and in san diego , one anchorman was more man than the rest .
his name was ron burgundy .
he was like a god walking amongst mere mortals .
he had a voice that could make a wolverine purr , and suits so fine they made sinatra look like a hobo .
ln other words , ron burgundy was the balls .

but each member brought their own special something to the equation .
people call me the bri man .
i' m the stylish one of the group .
i know what you' re asking yourself , and the answer is yes , i have a nickname for my penis .
it' s called the octagon .
but i also nicknamed my testes .

i' m all about havin ' fun .

as in , " gene tenace at the plate ... and whammy !
whammy !
i' m brick tamland .
people seem to like me because i am polite and i' m rarely late .
i like to eat ice cream , and i really enjoy a nice pair of slacks .

mentally retarded .

i don' t know how to put this , but i' m kind of a big deal .

i' ve very happy for you .
i' m very important .
i have ... many leather bound books , and my apartment smells of rich mahogany .

i' m not lonely !
i' m beloved by everyone in san diego .
wow .

you' re so wise .
you' re like a miniature buddha covered in hair .

bedtime .
okay , come on .
let' s go .
come on .
oh , that was one crazy party .
i am hung over .
tell me about it .
i woke up this morning and i shit a squirrel .
i mean it .
literally .
hell of it is , damn thing' s still alive .
so i got this shit covered squirrel down there in the office .
don' t know what to name it .
i' m sorry , champ .
i think i ate your chocolate squirrel .
all right , guys .
let' s focus up .
morning , everyone .
here are the stories we' re going to be chasing today .
it looks like ling wong , the rare panda at the san diego zoo , is pregnant .
this is a big one .
this could be the big story of the summer .
network is gonna be wanting plenty of coverage .
and speaking of network , word on the street is they' re looking for a new anchor .
so , ron ...
huh ?
network ?
are they here ?
a lot of you have been hearing the affiliates complaining about a lack of diversity on the news team .
what in the hell' s diversity ?
well , i could be wrong , but i believe diversity is an old , old wooden ship that was used during the civil war era .
i would be surprised if the affiliates were concerned about the lack of an old wooden ship , but nice try .
diversity means that times are changing , and with that in mind
ron , are you paying attention ?
nope .
this concerns all of us .
okay .
keeping that in mind , i' d like to introduce the latest addition to the kvwn news team , directly from wypn in asheville , north carolina ,
ms. veronica corningstone .  who' s that lady ?  hello .  who' s that lady ...  hello , everyone .
oh !
i just want you all to know that i look forward to contributing to this news station' s already sterling reputation .
i mean , come on , ed !
it' s bullcrap !
don' t get me wrong .
i love the ladies .
they rev my engine , but they don' t belong in the newsroom !
it is anchorman , not anchorlady !
and that is a scientific fact !
uh huh .
i don' t know what we' re yelling about !
ron , what do you think ?
she sh it' s terrible !
she has beautiful eyes , and her hair smells like cinnamon !
mm hmm .
loud noises !
all right , everyone relax .
she' s not gonna take anyone' s airtime .
i read somewhere that their periods attract bears .
bears can smell the menstruation .
well , that' s just great .
you hear that , ed ?
bears .
now you' re putting the whole station in jeopardy .
i will say one thing for her , ed , she does have a nice , big old behind .
i' d like to put some barbecue sauce on that butt and just bite , bite , bite , bite , munch , munch , munch !
ah whoo !
stop it !
oh , jeez .
look at the full moon butt !
champ !
champ !
champ , champ !
mr. harken , i was just wondering if you knew when my office would be ready .
well , that might take some time .
for now , why don' t you just grab a desk in the bullpen ?
you can use my office !
then afterwards maybe we can go to lunch !
lower your voice , ron .
mm hmm !
all right .
thank you , mr. harken .
i' il go get my desk set up .
oh , she is a saucy mama !
i mean , i would ...
here we go again .
every station it' s the same .
women ask me how i put up with it .
well , the truth is , i don' t really have a choice .
this is definitely a man' s world .
but while they' re laughing and grab assing ,
i' m chasing down leads and practicing my nonregional diction .
because the only way to win is to be the best .
the very best .
touchy situation .
i think the best thing to do with this corningstone , to keep her in line , is bed her quick .
oh , that behind is driving me loco !
i' m like a night wolf .
guys , take it easy .
just take it easy !
she' s got feelings , too .
oh , my god !
listen to burgundy .
he' s gone soft on us , like some schoolboy bitch .
you sound like a gay .
hey !
come on !
it' s me , papa burgundy , all right ?
as far as i' m concerned , corningstone' s fair game .
huh ?
let the games begin !
hi ohhh !
there he is .
there he is .
i' m very aroused .
what' s this ?
well , well , well .
ron burgundy and the channel 4 news team .
hello , wes mantooth .
hello , evening news team .
nice clothes , gentlemen .
i didn' t know the salvation army was having a sale .
am i right ?
look at these guys .
hey , where did you get those clothes ?
at the toilet store ?
what are you doing on our station' s turf , burgundy ?
you' re about to get a serious beat down .
i will smash your face into a car windshield and then take your mother , dorothy mantooth , out for a nice seafood dinner and never call her again !
dorothy mantooth is a saint !
you understand me ?
dorothy mantooth is a saint !
hey .
leave the mothers out of this , all right ?
it' s unnecessary .
besides , i' m sure wes here is just upset over finishing second in the ratings again .
ooh !
that' s completely uncalled for , burgundy .
you know those rating systems are flawed .
they don' t take into account houses that have more than two television sets and other things of that nature .
i guess i have to take you at your word ,
number two .
you have a great day , fellas .
we' il see you around the bend .
son of a bitch !
excusez moi , numero two .
hey , burgundy .
you know those sample audiences aren' t big enough !
stop hiding behind those phony numbers , burgundy !
i' m coming after you !
i hate you , ron burgundy .
i hate you !
you can' t say one word ?
even the guy who can' t think says something !
you guys just stand there ?
come on !
right , but i think my son is just going through a phase .
i have no idea where he would have gotten ahold of german pornography .
but you and i are mature adults .
we' ve both seen our share of pornographic materials .
oh , you never have ?
of course you haven' t , how stupid of me .
neither have l .
i was just speaking in generalities .
i' il stop by the school a little later , sister margaret .
bye .
ed , she insisted on coming in .
mr. harken , sir ,
i will not have my first story at this news station be about a cat fashion show .
miss corningstone , ma' am , you will do the stories to which you are assigned .
mr. harken , i am a damn good journalist , and this cat show thing is grade a baloney .
it is not baloney .
now , go do your job , missy !
it is baloney !
hey , ron ,
i' m gonna take a run at the new girl .
let the games begin .
oh , champ , champ , we' re not really gonna actually do that .
we were just flapping our gums .
oh , yeah .
you kill me , burgundy .
let me just grab this .
oh , sorry about that .
whammy .
hmm .
uh , champ ?
yeah .
you' re trying to touch my breasts , aren' t you ?
what can i say ?
i like the way you' re put together .
what do you say we go out on a date ?
have some chicken , maybe some sex .
you know , see what happens ?
oh , let me get this over here .
sorry .
oh , there it is .
i' il give this little cookie an hour before we' re doing the no pants dance .
time to musk up .
wow .
it never ceases to amaze me .
what cologne you gonna go with ?
london gentleman , or wait .
no , no , no .
hold on .
blackbeard' s delight .
no , she gets a special cologne .
it' s called sex panther by odeon .
it' s illegal in nine countries .
yep , it' s made with bits of real panther .
so you know it' s good .
it' s quite pungent .
oh yeah .
it' s a formidable scent .
it stings the nostrils .
ln a good way .
yep .
i' il be honest with you .
that smells like pure gasoline .
they' ve done studies , you know .
60 % of the time , it works every time .
that doesn' t make sense .
well ...
let' s go see if we can make this little kitty purr .
hey , sweet cheeks .
got an invite i' d like to extend your way .
my god .
what is that smell ?
oh !
that' s the smell of desire , milady .
god , no , it smells like
like a used diaper filled with lndian food .
oh !
excuse me .
desire smells like that to some people .
what is that ?
smells like a turd covered in burnt hair !
it smells like bigfoot' s dick !
oh .
oh , hell , that' s rank !
oh , what' s that smell ?
this is worse than the time the raccoon got in the copier .
yeah .
it' s very distracting .
when we get to the pet shop  cough !
look over here .
excuse me , veronica .
yes , what is it , brick ?
i would like to extend to you an invitation to the pants party .
excuse me ?
the party .
the pants
with the pants .
party with pants ?
brick , are you saying that there' s a party in your pants and i' m invited ?
that' s it .
hmm .
did brian tell you to say this , brick ?
no yes , he did .
okay .
no , i don' t want to go to a party in your pants .
very well .
lan ?
would you like to go to a party in my pants ?
no , brick .
all right .
let' s go !
all right , now ...
i' m telling you , she is a real ball buster .
a real ice queen .
mm .
i just burned my tongue .
the only way to bag a classy lady is to give her two tickets to the gun show ...
and see if she likes the goods .
1, 001 .
1, 002 .
uh , mr. burgundy ?
1, 003 .
helen said that you needed to see me ?
oh , miss corningstone .
i wasn' t expecting company .
just doing my workout .
tuesday' s arms and back .
you asked me to come by , sir .
oh , did l ?
yes .
oh , it' s the deep burn !
oh , it' s so deep .
i can barely lift my right arm ' cause i did so many .
i don' t know if you heard me counting .
i did over 1, 000 .
you have your ubulus muscle that connects to the upper dorsinus .
it' s boring , but it' s part of my life .
i' m just gonna grab this shirt , if you don' t mind .
just watch out for the guns .
they' il get you .
you are pathetic .
this has to be the feeblest pickup attempt that i have ever encountered .
i expected it from the rest of them , mr. burgundy , but not from you .
wait a minute !
l pickup attempt ?
i' m offended .
i have little time to get to the gym , so i have to sculpt my guns at the office .
oh , stop calling your arms " guns .
look .
my plan was to ask you if i could squire you about town as one professional helping another professional , because i know what it' s like to be lonely in a new city .
really ?
yes .
but now i am too hurt .
and shocked and offended and and hurt .
i could do that .
really ?
well , yes .
as a journalist , i should get to know the city that i' m covering .
but this is not a date .
no , of course not .
strictly professional .
wonderful .
hmm .
great .
shall i pick you up 8 : 00 ?
mm , 9 : 00 .
downstairs ?
mr. burgundy , you have a massive erection .
really ?
yes , i do .
um ...
i' m sorry , it' s the
it' s the pleats .
mm .
it' s actually an optical illusion .
it' s the pattern on the pants .
it' s not flattering in the crotchal region .
i' m actually taking them back right now .
taking them back to the pants store .
oh , this is awkward .
i' m gonna walk
i' m gonna walk this situation off and i will see you later .
nothing to look at .
go back to work , everyone .
don' t act like you' re not impressed .
don' t look at me right now .
i' m walking around the office .
my new walk .
i have a situation right now i' m trying to walk off .
frame up two .
let' s go to brian fantana live ...
gimme a tighter one on two . ... with a channel 4 news exclusive .

he will literally rip your face off .

shall we ?
yes .
san diego .

i know .
i love this city .
it' s a it' s a fact .
it' s the greatest city in the history of mankind .
discovered by the germans in 1904 .
they named it san diago , which of course in german means a whale' s vagina .
n no , there' s no way that' s correct .
i' m sorry .
i was trying to impress you .
oh .
i don' t know what it means .
i' il be honest .
i don' t think anyone knows what it means anymore .
scholars maintain that the translation was lost hundreds of years ago .
doesn' t it mean saint diego ?
no .
no .
no , that' s that' s what it means .
really .
well , agree to disagree .
may i take your order ?
yes , i am going to have three fingers of glenlivet with a little bit of pepper , and , uh , some cheese .

oh , okay .

tino' s the finest club owner in the city .
my best friend , right ?
yes .
yes , we have a saying in my country about people like him .
the coyote of the desert always likes to eat the heart of the young , where the blood drips down to children for breakfast , lunch and dinner ,
only the ribs will be broken in two .
tino .
okay .

to one day become a network anchor .
well , believe it or not , we share the same dream .
i too want to be an network anchor .
god , you are so beautiful .
we really should be going .
i swore that i would never get involved with a coworker .
wait .
what if , just for tonight , we weren' t coworkers ?
we were co people ?
i don' t  shh .

mmm .
well done , sir .
tip of the cap to you as well , miss corningstone .
i' m having very strong feelings for you , mr. burgundy .
mm .
but it' s very important to me that i be viewed as a professional .
right .
hmm .
when in rome .
yeah .
that , uh , expression doesn' t really apply to what i' m talking about .
oh , i' m  what i was saying .
i still don' t quite understand what it means .
oh , no .
you' il find it .
no , i was saying that , if we continue seeing each other , that we should keep it relatively quiet around the station .
absolutely , my wild love tigress .
tasteful discretion is the name of the game .
mm hmm .
veronica corningstone and i had sex , and now we are in love !
did i say that loud ?
yeah , you pretty much yelled it .
well , i can' t help it .
it' s fantastic !
what' s it like , ron ?
the intimate times ?
outta sight , my man !
no .
the other thing .
love .
yeah .
what is that ?
well , it' s tough to explain .
i think i was in love once .
really , what was her name ?
i don' t remember .
that' s not a good start , but keep going .
she was brazilian .
or chinese , or something weird .
i met her in the bathroom of a k mart , and we made out for hours .
then we parted ways , never to see each other again .
i' m pretty sure that' s not love .
damn it !
i love ... carpet .
i love desk .
are you just looking at things in the office and saying you love them ?
i love lamp .
do you really love the lamp , or are you saying it because you saw it ?
i love lamp !
i love lamp .
you really want to know what love is ?
yeah .
yes , tell us .
