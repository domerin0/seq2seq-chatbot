911 .
what is your emergency ?
i' m tired of the way things are , as opposed to the way they should be .
is this an emergency ?
where are you located ?
that really doesn' t matter .
can we have your name ?
of course .
common denominator .
your man on the street .
now don' t ask another question , or i will be obliged to do bad .
andyou would have to assume responsibility .
no interruptions .
natural selection .
natural selection .
born to win .
born to lose .
born to die .
three situations that make up everything in the world .
no interference is necessary .
but interference happens .
people interfere with an important task
i enjoy doing .
i don' t believe people are not good by nature , not at all .
so ifyou remove the authority , the police ,
then you' il see life as god intended it to be .
a world ofpandemonium .
without police , the weak and diseased would be gone .
streets red with blood .
the way nature intended it to be .
there will be another body found tonight .
thank you foryour time .
april fool , right ?
you' re kidding , right ?
you' ve picked a very fine diamond .
i' il tell you what , throw in a car and i' il take it .
throw in a hand , i' il take it .
perhaps a lesser gem would be more appropriate ?
nah , it' s perfect .
go !
go !
go !
go !
what' s up , malloy ?
you' re losing your touch .
he' il get you in the rematch .
don' t you worry , buddy .
i got plans tonight and they don' t include you guys .
i' il get killed if i don' t go .
she' il be pissed anyway .
one more round isn' t gonna make a rat' s ass difference .
i forgot i was dealing with the stable relationship brain trust here .
you guys ever heard of quittin ' while you' re ahead ?
you got a little drinking problem in this area over here .
give this guy another pop .
you feds any closer to nailing that son of a bitch ?
what d' you wanna hear ?
i got him giftwrapped out in the trunk .
we' re gettin ' close .
that' s bullshit .
no , we' re getting close .
i hope so .
tucker didn' t deserve that .
no cop does .
he' s puttin ' bodies on display like trophies .
son of a bitch knows we' re the ones who have to look at ' em , that' s why .
look , i' d love to tell you we got this guy ready for a toe tag and a slab .
but we' re dealin ' with a different kind of street logic here .
it' s a whole different breed .
there' s no repeatable patterns .
there' s no identifiable method .
he' s targeting cops , different precincts , different times .
every site' s clean .
but he' s gonna fuck up .
they all do .
when he does , we' il nail him .
come on , malloy .
we' ve had nine dead cops inside of six months .
if this was nine dead feds we were talkin ' about , that would be a different story .
a different story ?
you really think i give a shit what kind of badge a man wears ?
i think you' re feelin ' guilty because you and your fed friends are droppin ' the ball .
what happened to you , malloy ?
you used to be one of us before you became a fed .
ease up .
we' re all on the same team here .
yeah , ease up .
you finished ?
oh , yeah , everyone here knows i' m an asshole .
you got that right .
you are an asshole .
everyone knows that .
that' s a fact of life .
bring these guys anything they want , please .
just keep their mouths full .
wake up , sleeping beauty .
you wanna tell me why you were late for dinner ?
very funny .
got an excuse ?
sorry .
how was donovan' s ?
how do you know i was at donovan' s ?
cos i called .
no , you didn' t .
no , i didn' t .
that was my imitation of your ex wife .
ouch .
come on , don' t go there .
what happened to our date ?
these guys are goin ' through a bad time , so i was just talkin ' to them a little bit .
it' s always gonna be somethin ' .
if not this , somethin ' else , mary .
what is this ?
the beginning of a " you' re just too good for me " speech ?
is that what this is ?
stop bustin ' me already .
lucky for you , i' ve been checking out the competition , and the pickings are pretty damn slim , so i was thinking , what the hell ?
why not stay with me ?
are you tryin ' to tell me somethin ' , huh ?
maybe .
maybe not .
i have a surprise .
i got this great surprise , but it' s gonna have to keep for a while .
i' m gonna give it to you , but i wanna have a clear head when i do .
whatever happened to roses ?
roses ?
obviously you haven' t been reading cosmopolitan .
obviously .
romantically speaking , roses are totally obsolete and monkeys are the new language of love .
i didn' t know that .
well , if that' s the case ... why don' t you and your little friend come to bed ?
i think we just got lucky .
forget it .
i work alone .
i could have made it myself , you know .
and you would have gotten another dul .
hey , jimmy , are you gonna tuck me in ?
christ .
jimmy ?
what the hell is this ?
a treasure hunt ?
everybody make sure you step on every damn thing you can .
you see anything you want , just take it on home .
friend of yours ?
yeah .
a long time .
i can' t find any sign of gunpowder tattooing .
the shooter was most likely several feet back .
he was in whispering distance .
see the starburst splitting of the skin here , doc ?
gun was pressed directly against the head .
the killer wanted him to feel the barrel .
nine dead cops inside of six months .
if this was nine dead feds we were talkin ' about , that would be a different story .
let' s cut him down .
how long do you plan to have him hang there ?
junior hasn' t finished analysing the body .
what do you think you' re gonna find ?
why don' t you get that club out of his throat ?
he' s a cop !
let me handle this .
fine .
hello ?
let me speak with agent malloy .
it' s for you .
thanks .
it' s malloy .
you andyour friend were out late .
who is this ?
tell me , malloy , what do you see in that dead cop ' s eyes ?
do you see recrimination ?
because it' s your fault .
who is this ?
they' ve all died because of you .
what are you talkin ' about ?
we' il get to that .
but first things first .
you know , she' s got a lovely place here .
nice neighbourhood .
it almost looked safe ... until now .
you really should have stayed home and played house , instead of playing hunter .
he' s at my house .
her name is mary , right ?
i' il bet she has nice eyes .
he' s at my fuckin ' house !
1311 oak !
westside .
go !
go !
come on , mary .
pick up the goddamn phone !
send all available units .
i' m sorry , but mary can' t come to the phone right now .
what do you want ?
you' re the agent in charge ofmy case , aren' t you ?
that' s right , so whatever you gotta do , do it to me !
i am doing it to you , malloy .
and i' m doing it to her .
you still haven' t told me what you want .
four years ago you were in charge ofan investigation ofa series ofmurders .
atrocities against prostitutes .
i call it removing diseased filth .
you got very close to getting me .
you' d rather protect them and remove me .
you made my life hell .
so now i' m returning the favour .
keep him talking , jake .
hunting the hunter .
i won' t live long .
the odds are against that .
so what time i have left , i will dedicate to you .
i' il always be close , like hide and seek .
now , about mary ...
to kill a man is easy , but kill what he loves and he dies a thousand times .
please don' t hurt her .
please .
i' il see you , butyou won' t see me .
mary !
mary !
mary !
mary !
where is she ?
mary !
mary !
oh , jeez .
agent hendricks !
we got him .
hey , tommy !
what' s the story ?
security guard spotted him covered in blood , dressed in swat gear .
son of a bitch didn' t say a word , just opened fire .
guard ok ?
he took one in the leg .
lost a lot of blood .
called for backup before he passed out .
i see you , you see me .
you on the roof , identify yourself .
identify yourself now .
this is the police .
you buyin ' shares in this place ?
hey .
kill me again .
listen to me .
i ...
i' ve been diggin ' around .
there' s this place out in wyoming .
it' s a detox centre .
just hear me out this time .
it' s run by a former cop for cops .
you know ... if she' d never met me , never knew me , she' d still be alive .
i' m where i wanna be , where i should be .
that' s where i am .
ok .
i' il make you a deal .
you blow your brains out like a damn man and stop pissing on mary' s memory one sorry ass day at a time , and i' il take care of your tab .
what the fuck is ... ? !
what' s the matter with you ? !
it' s all right , everybody .
a little accident .
everybody relax .
what' s the matter with you ? !
whether you like it or not , you still got a life to live .
it doesn' t end here .
do you believe in reincarnation ?
transmigration of the soul ?
any of that stuff ?
i do believe i was a shitkicker in a previous life .
well ... nothing a few nice curtains couldn' t fix up .
hey , look , partner , if you ever need to return the favour , make it miami .
we run a dual diagnosis programme here .
a fancy way of saying we' re gonna detox your ass and then tackle your demons head on in group sessions .
i was a cop for 12 years before i took a shot at drinking myself to death .
so i know what keeps you up at night .
gonna make it all go away , huh ?
not even gonna try .
no magic wands here .
the shit you swallowed doesn' t digest .
you carryin ' a weapon , mr malloy ?
i' il have to confiscate it .
need the shield , too .
we don' t allow crutches here .
thought i' d stick around awhile , burn up a little vacation time , maybe even rent me a cabin .
do some ice fishing ?
yeah , why not ?
see if i can' t catch more than a shot glass .
hey , this is gonna be a piece of cake .
doc .
the man' s my better half .
i sure as hell don' t intend to lose him out here in jerkwater , wyoming .
do you follow me ?
jack .
see if you can' t find some boots and a parka for this man .
anything to serve these fine officers , doc .
you might run into more than a cool breeze up here .
come on .
let' s get you checked in .
the place was built in the 50s as a command control centre for strategic air command .
satellites made the facility obsolete , so they converted it to a military asylum .
uncle sam put it on the market last year .
it' s isolated as hell and that' s why i chose it .
you' re the last of our patients to arrive .
you know the rules , slater .
no smoking in the rooms .
i' d like you to meet jake malloy .
we got nothin ' to hide here , including our names .
slater , metropolitan police department of london .
i know it' s a long way to come to quit the shakes .
club med was fully booked .
ain' t exactly betty ford , huh ?
last place i was at was a twelve step health spa .
mud baths , nature walks .
we don' t got tv here .
convicted felons , doc , get tv .
jaworski here' s a narc .
and a hell of a sharpshooter .
shut up , limey !
nobody' s talkin ' to you .
this is jake malloy , fbl .
hey , we got a fed gracin ' our presence .
hey , malloy , any idea of the three most overrated things in the world ?
home cookin ' , home fuckin ' and the fbl .
let' s get your blood and urine sample , see what we' re up against .
our resident psychiatrist was an air force consultant here for four years .
when the facility shut down , she signed on with us .
she' s pulling double duty as a nurse , till we get fully staffed .
we used to take care of almost 100 patients here .
there' s only ten of you cops .
but judging from your case files , i don' t think anyone' s gonna be bored .
this is jack bennett , one of our orderlies .
jake malloy , new arrival .
if you need anything , ask jack .
he knows the place like the back of his hand .
that' s what they say .
i know every inch of this nuthouse .
anything else , ma' am ?
i don' t think so .
manny , this is jake .
see if you can fatten him up .
hey .
hope you ain' t a vegetarian .
gilbert , say hi to jake .
hey , jake .
how you doin ' ?
you wanna hear about the generator ?
don' t worry .
i' il keep her hummin ' with spit and balin ' wire if i have to .
and the boiler' s about to go , too , doc .
then fix it .
you' re the caretaker , hank .
have you managed to get settled in ?
first night' s a bitch .
how long you been here ?
couple of days .
no one' s been here more than a week .
don' t have to meet them to know them .
take noah there , all buffed out like a fag .
completely paranoid .
back to the wall type .
got swat written all over him .
fuck !
fuckin ' motherfucker' s motherfucked !
lopez .
lapd .
reverend jones .
worked homicide before he found jesus at the bottom of a bottle .
check out jaworski .
this guy couldn' t even swallow a bullet .
stupid fucker missed his brain and blew half his cheek out .
see the old guy ?
mckenzie .
member of the royal canadian mounted police .
word is he froze up , let his partner get shot .
they put him on the rubber gun squad .
all right , let' s get started .
this is what i call the witchin ' hour .
no lessons , no twelve steps .
this is your time .
they told me to put ' em in the bag .
the pieces .
they were so tiny .
little fingers .
every once in a while i' d get a whole hand or ... part of a leg .
mostly blood .
it was everywhere .
their little fingers were just ... rolling around .
i dropped it .
i ...
i tried to gather ' em up , but there was so much blood .
i can still smell it .
21 preschoolers were blown to pieces .
some of their fingers still had paint on ' em .
they were finger painting when it happened .
you got somethin ' to add , noah ?
this ain' t the boy scouts .
this ain' t about helpin ' old ladies across the street .
he' s just a kid .
oh , bullshit .
he' s just weak , like the rest of you mamsy pamsy motherfuckers .
if you can' t stand the smell of trash , why are you workin ' in the garbage business ?
maybe he' s not as strong as us .
maybe he never learned to like the smell .
you laugh it up , smiley .
you sure as shit won' t see me swallowing my gun .
so what do you swallow ?
a fifth of gin ?
maybe a little speed ?
it ain' t the same .
yes , it is .
let' s be clear about somethin ' .
you people landed here for a reason .
it' s not just your careers you' re killin ' .
booze may be a slow burn , but it' s still suicide .
de luxe cabin , my ass !
how' d it go ?
the first session .
i don' t know .
what do you wanna hear ?
i got no more demons , no more monsters ?
we all have demons .
but i stopped believing in monsters when i was 12 .
that' s cos you never met any .
don' t be naive , jenny .
is that her ring ?
look , i know you mean well , but you' re in way over your head on this one .
do you think words are gonna make a difference , gonna change anything ?
they' re not .
so just do yourself a favour and don' t waste your time on me .
looks like we' re in for one .
you know , my mary had a scarf like that .
we can' t have this goin ' on here !
keep out of everybody else' s business .
don' t jump over my ass .
he' s the one ...
i' m sure he didn' t mean anything by it .
it' s a misunderstanding .
yeah .
something like that .
the point is he ripped it off .
yeah !
fine .
suppose he ripped it off .
what do you wanna do about it ?
did you take it ?
jack ?
maybe you should give it back .
thanks for the light , old timer .
stupid cops .
how you doin ' ?
do you wanna get some air ?
if you wanna talk , i' m right over here .
looks like we' il be in this place a while .
hey !
no !
it' s ok .
it' s ok .
it was just a nightmare .
can i help you ?
here , take these .
they' il help you sleep .
would you mind ?
would i mind what ?
stayin ' a minute .
oh , god .
can' t get through .
storm must have knocked down the lines .
it ain' t like anyone' s gonna make it out here anyway , boss .
we' re socked in .
i ain' t gonna think about ploughin ' until the storm breaks .
what are we gonna do ?
break the news to the group .
hank , you get gilbert up here to help you move the body .
i think i' il be goin ' with just a salad tonight .
did he leave a note ?
none that i could find .
no offence , doc , but this mini alcatraz you got goin ' here ain' t gonna change a goddamn thing .
you may dry a few of ' em up , but you ain' t gonna change what they' re made of .
the boy was weak .
we all knew that .
it was just a matter of time before old humpty fell off the wall .
and what about dudley do right there , huh ?
what a peach he is .
30 years of bullshit war stories , only to leave his partner for dead .
alone .
no one to watch his back .
there' s nothin ' worse in my book than a goddamn yellow cop .
you see what i mean , doc ?
you ain' t the wizard of oz here .
you can' t just hand out courage .
you' re real good at kickin ' ' em when they' re down , aren' t you ?
do ok when they' re standing up , too .
you never stood up to anybody .
yeah ?
well , at least i' m there for my women .
that' s enough .
hey , doc !
check it out !
man overboard !
get my bag .
it' s in the office .
earthquake !
he' s had alcohol .
what' s wrong ?
he' s on disulfiram .
makes you puke if you even smell booze .
he looks bad .
shit !
looks like he swallowed a damn dog .
give us a hand .
what do you want me to do ?
hold him .
hold him still .
a little aqua velva over the rocks ?
i rest my case , doc .
hold him .
i want everyone' s belts .
off with them .
now !
shoelaces , too .
do it !
i want the rooms checked every hour on the hour .
anything you say , sheriff .
hey , you know that hospital about ten or so miles up the canyon ?
you mean the old loony bin ?
yeah , right .
i got a friend i' m tryin ' to ring stayin ' up there .
your friend sick in the head , is he ?
in more ways than one .
well , the lines are down .
you a cop ?
thought so .
been a few passin ' through here lately .
one took a cabin for the night , bought out all my scotch , damn near tore it down .
another looked like he shaved with a cheese grater .
so how are the fish biting ?
you happen to see what' s goin ' on outside ?
it' s called the dead of winter .
i meant ice fishing .
i' d love to try my luck .
maybe you could help me out .
maybe .
fact is , you couldn' t have picked a better time of year .
we both know that if someone really wants to kill themselves , there' s no stopping it .
i know you have to believe that , jenny .
but i can' t .
that' s what this place is about .
stoppin ' em .
i don' t get it .
why do you put yourself through this ?
you got family , malloy ?
no , i don' t .
neither do i. no .
the job is all i got .
i' m not a coward , you know .
i know that .
but try and remind yourself now and then .
that goes both ways .
can' t sleep ?
i didn' t mean to spook you .
i never knew .
knew you could miss someone so much ?
i didn' t know that .
just remember that sometimes the real bad things in life can make you stronger .
what' s the matter , cowboy ?
somebody steal your horse ?
no , i just thought i heard something .
like what ?
i don' t know .
something .
cock a doodle doo !
good morning to you !
rise and shine , lazy ladies !
it' s a wonderful day in the neighbourhood !
wakey , wakey !
oh ...
doc !
doc !
doc !
two suicides back to back ? !
get mr fed in here .
he' s seen his share of dead officers .
the bruise is in the shape of an inverted v.
what does that mean ?
the markings say it' s a suicide .
the v is from the noose .
if he was strangled , it' d be a straight line bruise .
hey , doc .
the waiting list for this place is getting shorter by the minute .
still taking bets on who the next suicide' s gonna be ?
the man didn' t say it was a suicide .
he just said the markings say that .
and god shall wipe away all the tears from their eyes .
and there shall be no more death .
neither shall there be any more pain .
i' m tearin ' up here , reverend
shit !
i can' t risk finding any more bodies .
i' il have to lock you in your rooms .
oh , you gotta be kiddin ' me !
i need to review everyone' s case files .
lookin ' for what ?
answers .
look , man .
solitary confinement ?
no fuckin ' way , man !
it' s for your own safety .
nobody lockin ' me up in no cell !
is somethin ' funny ?
if the idea of a bunch of cops being locked up like common criminals isn' t a joke , what is , then ?
doctor mitchell , can i have a word ?
what ?
jack' s missing .
jack' s your responsibility .
maybe he took a joyride .
we' re short one snowmobile .
he' il freeze to death .
he ain' t the only one !
boiler bought the farm .
mm hm .
manny !
afraid soldier boy' s turned into a human ice cube by now .
yeah , the hell with jack .
who knows what that crazy fucker' s up to !
conner and brandon .
they weren' t prior suicide attempts , were they ?
i want you to lock your room tonight .
why ?
please .
just do it .
damn !
hey !
hey !
come back here !
jack ?
jack !
jack !
we' re droppin ' like fuckin ' flies !
knock it off !
you' re losing it .
you' re all losing it .
slater' s right .
we' re cops .
what would slater know about bein ' a cop ?
bobbies don' t even carry a gun !
god forbid i put myself on a par with america' s finest .
shut up !
communications are down .
our meds are gone .
one orderly and doc , who knows where they are !
and we got two bodies .
that , and you' re all in danger of experiencing dt' s .
sweetcakes , shakes are the least of our worries .
you got a medical degree we don' t know about ?
let her talk !
i' m not talking about the shakes .
grand mal seizure caused by dt' s ... can kill you .
without meds , you' re all vulnerable .
maybe you should tell them about jack .
hey , lady ?
what the hell is he talkin ' about ?
i don' t know .
bullshit !
you tell ' em , or i will .
jenny , doc' s missing .
two men are dead .
if there' s something you need to tell us , now is the time .
you should check his service record .
i already did that .
the guy was a patient here .
oh , that' s great !
the son of a bitch murdered his commanding officer over in south korea .
strangled him .
psycho !
and you gave this crazy fuck a job ? !
come on , lopez !
back off .
since when did protecting women become your specialty , malloy ?
you' re right .
it' s not .
my specialty ... is doing my job ... while the one good thing in my life is home , being butchered .
you talk about her again , i' m gonna kill you .
how' d jack end up working here ?
i vouched for him .
he was totally rehabilitated .
what about gilbert ?
a manic depressive .
he hates violence .
look , jack' s got nothing to do with this .
i know that .
hey , people !
gilbert found doc .
jones .
jaworski .
noah .
lopez .
that' s the scotch drinker , all right .
guess he never made it to detox .
you' re tellin ' me this guy' s a cop ?
well , that' s what he said .
now , what the hell is goin ' on up there ?
i need to get up there .
whoever did this must have used a sledge .
they hammered the living shit out of these carburettors .
the snowmobiles are finished .
let' s take the suburban , go for help .
if i had extra hands , we could dig our way out if we get stuck .
the freezer' s fillin ' up fast .
i think he' s right .
hank , take jenny and gilbert .
manny can help with the digging .
no .
weeks can' t be moved .
we need someone here with medical expertise .
it' s not a request .
you don' t have to be here .
where would i be safer ?
riding through a whiteout with some yahoo like hank , or sitting here in a room full of armed officers ?
how about you ?
no way .
i' m gonna go down with the ship .
you guys go while there' s still some light .
we' re outta here !
c' mon , gilbert , let' s go .
now what ?
we can rotate two man shifts on watch .
who made you king shit ?
he' s ranking officer .
i ain' t in uniform .
i thought swat boys were team players .
my team doesn' t wait around to get hit by a shitstorm .
we are the shitstorm .
i' m with noah .
i say we find this crazy piece of shit and frosty his ass .
how do you know it' s jack ?
how do you know that ?
how do you know it' s not ...
lopez , or jones ?
how do we know it isn' t slater ?
how do i know it isn' t you ?
me ?
yeah ... right !
you better keep an eye on that one , nursie .
he crackin ' !
split the building into sections .
each person will clear an area .
point me in the direction .
i see you .
butyou won' t see me .
he' il die without it .
jenny , where' d you find conner' s body ?
hank !
do ya think we can get the truck through yet ?
keep digging , manny .
what was that ?
gilbert' s gone !
i don' t give a shit where he' s gone !
we' re gettin ' the hell outta here !
get in the truck .
what' s that ?
look out !
look out !
anything scares you , kill it .
hank !
where' d you go ?
hank !
jack !
jack .
gilbert !

hey .
frozen corpses don' t bite .
you' re used to seeing bodies .
i' m not .
it' s ok .
weeks is burning up .
i need ice .
will you get it for me ?
who' s the fuckin ' brainiac that locked the door ? !
shit !
what were you doing outside ?
noah told me to check for tracks .
did you see malloy ?
why ?
should i have seen him ?
is there something goin ' on here i should know about ?
jack ?
come on , now , jacky boy ...
no more games .
main circuit board died with mckenzie .
that means no power , no heat .
the emergency lights are not gonna last long .

it' s gonna be 20 below in here by morning !
this is bullshit !
this is bullshit , malloy !
come on .
malloy !
what happened ?
jack and manny are dead .
hank' s gone .
where' s gilbert ?
he saw me and he bolted .
he' s still out there ?
i found the missing snowmobile .
whoever took it burned the personal files .
why ?
makes it impossible to prove who' s who .
one of us isn' t a cop .
give me a knife .
what are you looking for ?
what are you looking for ? !
confirmation !
confirmation of what ? !
i see you .
you see me .
he' s here .
what are you talking about ?
he' s here !
agh !
dead ...
dead ... dead ...
what' d he say ?
all dead .
they' re all dead .
open up !
come on , open up !
for the last time , i got out of there when i saw jack strung up .
i almost got lost in the blizzard .
i' m coming back through the utility tunnels when malloy comes in .
he' s not just down there for a walk , so i hide behind the woodpile , ok ?
it' s not malloy .
i was with him .
he went out there to help you .
well , what do i know ? !
malloy should stay locked in my cell .
just to be safe .
yeah ?
tell you what ... you don' t have to be a fed to read a flashing sign .
maybe it' s time for reverend jones to explain the artwork !
don' t you ever paw me , boy .
you understand ?
maybe malloy was right about one of us not being a cop .
somebody was out there in that storm .
if it wasn' t hank , or malloy , who was it ?
you were outside looking for tracks , right ?
right .
and i got locked out .
did you ?
guess my cover' s finally blown .
ignorant assholes .
it' s not me , it' s one of you .
get the fuck outta my face !
get the fuck outta my face !
drop the gun !
noah , don' t !
back off !
drop the gun , asshole !
mine shoots bullets , too , motherfucker !
stop it !
i feel safer already .
christ , it' s slater .
i' m very close .
so close , you don' t know it .
i stare into your eyes , andyou see nothing .
i see you .
butyou don' t see me .
so what did the fed say about all this ?
he talked like it was someone he knew .
someone he tracked .
the cop killer ?
he' s dead , isn' t he ?
he' d better be .
hey , any cop killer steps my way , i' il cap his ass .
well , let' s hope you do .
what do you mean , hope ?
you' ve studied guys like this , doc .
they don' t just kill you .
they play with you .
hey , man , i don' t wanna hear this , ok ?
they gouge out your eyes , shove things down your throat .
are you deaf ?
maybe the lord' s got other plans .
maybe we' il freeze to death first .
you wanna show us where that woodpile is ?
what , are you nuts ? !
i ain' t goin ' back down there .
well , i ain' t goin ' down there by myself .
lead on .
wood store' s down this way .
sh !
you hear that ?
hear what ?
i think we got company .
not for long .
you two ... clear that one .
i got this one .
come on .
move !
i found that hidden above slater' s room .
it' s him .
he' s taking trophies .
if we' re gonna get outta here , here' s what we do .
you and lopez check upstairs .
i' il take the tunnels .
jenny , you stay here with jaworski .
why ? !
please , just trust me .
hank !
slater !
hank !
slater !
hey , cop .
drop the weapon .
hands behind your head .
fingers locked .
that' s it .
now , on your knees .
you know , i like playing cop .
how do you like playing the victim ?
huh ?
d' you like how it feels ?
come on .
please .
please .
wasn' t it you who was gonna cap my ass , tough guy ?
open your eyes .
look at me .
that a boy !
see ?
look here .
you see somebody comin ' up them stairs , you let faith guide that bullet right through their head .
right ?
malloy .
malloy !
malloy .
malloy !
i see you , malloy .
butyou still don' t see me .
fuck you !
we' ve got to do something !
why ?
malloy' s already dead .
who was he ?
who ?
your stand in .
oh , you mean the real mr slater i tracked up here .
last i saw , he was detoxing at the bottom ofa frozen lake .
i didn' t think you' d mind me borrowing his name and his badge .
from there , it was easy .
ijust came here and blended in .
you' re real good at blending in , aren' t ya , scumbag ?
is that how you found out about this place ?
just blending in at the cop bar ?
that doesn' t matter now .
what matters is i got to you before you got to me .
people will ask if i was insane .
just the opposite .
an insane man could not have accomplished this .
all these deaths , including mary' s , weren' t irrational .
they were to prove a point .
you cannot control what nature intended , malloy .
we ' re born to perform a duty , which i' ve done .
and so you finally see me .
now what ?
you know , you never feel more alive than when you' re watching someone else die .
like when i stared at poor mary .
but once again , malloy , you' re too late .
now i imagine you are staring at poor noah .
malloy !
malloy !
malloy !
dj vu , huh , malloy ?
how many second chances do you get in life ?
you think you' re strong enough to stop me ?
run , jenny !
run !
you' re too young to die .
run , jenny !
run !
run !
i' il cut her fucking heart out .
jenny ...
i like your eyes .
let me see your eyes .
did i mention i hear voices ?
right now i hear malloy ... pleading for his precious mary .
you stay here !
i' m gonna follow these tracks .
make me work for it .
do you see me ?
cos i see you .
stay ... here .
freeze !
drop the weapon !
on your knees .
hands behind your head .
lock your fingers .
it' s your turn now .
it' s time to die .
now , look at me .
slater !
she ... called out your ... name ...
just before i ... drained the life ... from her .
i see you .
you see ... this .
you ok ?
how was the fishin ' ?
icy .
