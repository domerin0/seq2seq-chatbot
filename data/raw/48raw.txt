by 300 ad , the roman empire extended from arabia to britain .
but they wanted more .
more land .
more peoples loyal and subservient to rome .
but no people so important as the powerful sarmatians to the east .
thousands died on that field .
and when the smoke cleared on the fourth day , the only sarmatian soldiers left alive were members ofthe decimated but legendary cavalry .
the romans , impressed by theirbravery and horsemanship , spared theirlives .
452 ad
in exchange , these warriors were incorporated into the roman military .
better they had died that day .
father .
they are here .
for the secondpart ofthe bargain they struck indebted not only themselves ...
the day has come . .. but also theirsons , and theirsons , and so on , to serve the empire as knights .
i was such a son .
there is a legend that fallen knights return as great horses .
he has seen what awaits you , and he will protect you .
lancelot !
lancelot !
lancelot .
don' t be afraid .
i will return .
how long shall we be gone ?
1 5 years , not including the months it' il take to get to your post .
lancelot !
ourpost was britain orat least the southern half , for the land was divided by a 73 mile wall built three centuries before us to protect the empire from the native fighters ofthe north .
so , as ourforefathers had done , we made our way and reported to ourroman commanderin britain , ancestrally named for the firstartorius , orarthur .
1 5 years later
ah , as promised , the bishop' s carriage .
our freedom , bors .
mm .
i can almost taste it .
and your passage to rome , arthur .
argh !
woads !
yaa rgh !
yah !
argh !
argh !
rus !
aagh !
rus !
rus .
gratia plena , dominus tecum .
benedicta tu in mulieribus et dominus tecum .
benedicta tu in mulieribus .
benedictus fructus ventris tui , iesus .
benedicta tu in mulieribus ...
save your prayers , boy .
your god doesn' t live here .
why did merlin send you south of the wall ?
spill my blood with excalibur and ... make this ground holy .
pick it up .
pick it up .
bors .
what a bloody mess .
that' s not the bishop .
god help us .
what are they ?
blue demons that eat christians alive .
you' re not a christian , are you ?
does this really work ?
nothing .
maybe i' m not doin ' it right .
arthur !
arthur castus .
your father' s image .
i haven' t seen you since childhood .
bishop germanius .
welcome to britain .
i see your military skills are still of use to you .
your device worked .
ancient tricks of an ancient dog .
and these are the great sarmatian knights we have heard so much of in rome .
i thought the woads control the north of hadrian' s wall .
they do , but they occasionally venture south .
rome' s anticipated withdrawal from britain has only increased their daring .
woads ?
british rebels who hate rome .
men who want their country back .
who leads them ?
he' s called merlin .
a dark magician , some say .
tristan , ride ahead and make sure the road is clear .
please do not worry , bishop .
we will protect you .
oh .
i' ve no doubt , commander .
no doubt .
dozens don' t worry me nearly so much as thousands .
thousands ?
well , now that we' re free men , i' m gonna drink till i can' t piss straight .
you do that every night .
i never could piss straight .
too much of myself to handle ... down there .
well , it' s a problem .
no , really , it is .
it' s a problem .
it' s like a baby' s arm holding an apple .
.. baby' s arm holding an apple .
i don' t like him , that roman .
lf he' s here to discharge us , why doesn' t he just give us our papers ?
ls this your happy face ?
galahad , do you still not know the romans ?
they won' t scratch their asses without holding a ceremony .
why don' t you just kill him , and then discharge yourself after ?
i don' t kill for pleasure , unlike some .
well , you should try it someday .
you might get a taste for it .
it' s a part of you .
it' s in your blood .
no , no , no .
no .
as of tomorrow this was all just a bad memory .
ohh .
i' ve often thought about what going home would mean after all this .
what will i do ?
it' s different for galahad .
i' ve been in this life longer than the other .
so much for home .
it' s not so clear in my memory .
you speak for yourself .
it' s cold back there and everyone i know is dead and buried .
besides , i have , i think , a dozen children .
eleven .
you listen .
when the romans leave here , we' il have the run of all this place .
i' il be governor in my own village and dagonet will be my personal guard and royal ass kisser .
won' t you , dag ?
first thing i will do when i get home is find a beautiful sarmatian woman to wed .
a beautiful sarmatian woman ?
why do you think we left in the first place ?
what about you , lancelot ?
what are your plans for home ?
well , if this woman of gawain' s is as beautiful as he claims ,
i expect to be spending a lot of time at gawain' s house .
his wife will welcome the company .
i see .
and what will i be doing ?
wondering at your good fortune that all your children look like me .
ls that before or after i hit you with my ax ?
where you been , now ?
where you been ?
and what will you do , arthur , when you return to your beloved rome ?
give thanks to god that i survived to see it .
you and your god !
you disturb me .
i want peace , lancelot .
i' ve had enough .
you should visit me .
ah !
it' s a magnificent place , rome .
ordered , civilized , advanced .
a breeding ground of arrogant fools .
the greatest minds in all the lands have come together in one sacred place to help make mankind free .
and the women ?
open the gate !
welcome back , arthur .
jols .
lancelot .
bishop , please , my quarters have been made available to you .
oh , yes .
i must rest .
where have you been ?
oh ...
i' ve been waiting for you .
oh , my little flower .
such ... passion !
where' s my gilly ?
gilly .
you been fighting ?
yes .
you been winning ?
yes .
that' s my boy .
come on , all my other bastards !
pelagius .
very kind of arthur to give up his room .
but , of course , it is to be expected .
sir , i' m here to escort you to the fortress hall .
when my master meets with your knights , he must be seated last and he must be seated at the head of the table .
your master can plonk his holy ass wherever he chooses .
his eminence , bishop naius germanius .
a round table ?
what sort of evil is this ?
arthur says for men to be men they must first all be equal .
i was given to understand there would be more of you .
there were .
we have been fighting here for 1 5 years , bishop .
oh , of course .
arthur and his knights have served with courage to maintain the honor of rome' s empire on this last outpost of our glory .
rome is most indebted to you noble knights .
to your final days as servants to the empire .
day .
not days .
the pope' s taken a personal interest in you .
he inquires after each of you , and is curious to know if your knights have converted to the word of our savior or ... ?
they retain the religion of their forefathers .
i have never questioned that .
of course , of course .
they are pagans .
hm ?
for our part , the church has deemed such beliefs innocence , but you , arthur , your path to god is through pelagius ?
i saw his image in your room .
he took my father' s place for me .
his teachings on free will and equality have been a great influence .
i look forward to our reunion in rome .
ah .
rome awaits your arrival with great anticipation .
you are a hero .
ln rome , you will live out your days in honor and wealth .
alas ...
alas , we are all but players in an ever changing world .
barbarians from every corner are almost at rome' s door .
because of this , rome and the holy father have decided to remove ourselves from indefensible outposts , such as britain .
what will become of britain is not our concern anymore .
i suppose the saxons will claim it soon .
saxons ?
yes .
ln the north a massive saxon incursion has begun .
the saxons only claim what they kill .
and only kill everything .
so you would just leave the land to the woads .
and i risked my life for nothing .
hm .
gentlemen , your discharge papers with safe conduct throughout the roman empire .
but first , i must have a word with your commander .
ln private .
we have no secrets .
come .
let' s leave roman business to romans .
let it go , bors .
rome has issued a final order for you and your men .
final order ?
you are to travel north to rescue the family of marius honorius and return , in particular , with marius' s son , alecto .
alecto is the pope' s favorite godchild and pupil .
it is his destiny to become a bishop , perhaps even pope one day .
on this day you ask this of my men .
on this day .
they have risked their lives for 1 5 years for a cause not of their own .
and now , on the day they are to be liberated , you send them on a mission which is far more dangerous than any other they have undertaken .
you tell me , bishop , how do i go to my men and tell them that instead of freedom i offer death ?
lf your men are truly the knights of legend , perhaps some will survive .
lf it is god' s will .
your men want to go home , and to get home they need to cross the entire breadth of the roman empire .
deserters would be hunted down like dogs .
will you defy the pope , arthur ?
rome ?
god himself ?
everything i' ve done has been for the church and for rome .
do not mistake a loyal soldier for a fool , germanius .
would you leave a defenseless roman boy , destined to lead our church , at the hands of the saxons ?
fulfill this mission , and your men will receive their discharge .
their papers will be waiting here the moment they return .
you have my word .
you think very hard upon that vow , bishop , for i will hold you to it .
break it , and no roman legion , papal army , nor god himself will protect you .
that is my word .
she gave me fleas .
you better hope they' re fleas .
best of three .
who wants another drink ?
ahh .
when you gonna leave bors and come home with me ?
my lover is watching you .
mmm ...
you look nothing like him .
you' re all bors .
tristan ...
how do you do that ?
i aim for the middle .
oh , they want more !
here .
be a mother to your son .
oh , come here .
dagonet , where you been ?
we' ve got plans to make .
here , please .
sing .
no .
just a last one .
no , i' m trying to work .
come sing .
shut up !
vanora will sing .
no , no .
sing about home .
don' t drop the baby .
arthur !
arthur !
arthur !
you' re not completely roman yet , right ?
rus !
knights ... brothers in arms ... your courage has been tested beyond all limits .
yes .
but i must ask you now for one further trial .
drink .
we must leave on a final mission for rome before our freedom can be granted .
above the wall , far in the north , there is a roman family in need of rescue .
they are trapped by saxons .
our orders are to secure their safety .
let the romans take care of their own .
above the wall is woad territory .
our duty to rome , if it was ever a duty , is done .
our pact with rome is done .
every knight here has laid his life on the line for you .
for you .
and instead of freedom you want more blood ?
our blood ?
you think more of roman blood than you do of ours ?
bors !
these are our orders .
we leave at first light , and when we return your freedom will be waiting for you .
a freedom we can embrace with honor .
i am a free man !
i will choose my own fate !
yeah , yeah .
we' re all going to die someday .
lf it' s a death from a saxon hand that frightens you , stay home .
listen , if you' re so eager to die , you can die right now !
enough .
enough !
i' ve got something to live for !
the romans have broken their word .
we have the word of arthur .
that is good enough .
i' il prepare .
bors ?
you coming ?
of course i' m coming !
can' t let you go on your own !
you' il all get killed !
i' m just saying what you' re all thinking !
vanora' il kill me .
and you , gawain ?
i' m with you .
galahad as well .
o merciful god , i have such need of your mercy now .
not for myself , but for my knights , for this is truly their hour of need .
deliver them from the trials ahead , and i will repay you a thousandfold with any sacrifice you ask of me .
and if , in your wisdom , you should determine that that sacrifice must be my life for theirs , so they may once again taste the freedom that has so long been denied to them ,
i will gladly make that covenant .
my death will have a purpose .
i ask no more than that .
why do you always talk to god and not to me ?
oh , pray to whomever you pray that we don' t cross the saxons .
my faith is what protects me , lancelot .
why do you challenge this ?
i don' t like anything that puts a man on his knees .
no man fears to kneel before the god he trusts .
without faith , without belief in something , what are we ?
to try and get past the woads in the north is insanity .
them we' ve fought before .
not north of the wall !
how many saxons ?
hm ?
how many ? !
tell me .
do you believe in this mission ?
these people need our help .
it is our duty to bring them out .
i don' t care about your charge , and i don' t give a damn about romans , britain or this island .
lf you desire to spend eternity in this place , arthur , so be it , but suicide cannot be chosen for another !
and yet you choose death for this family !
no , i choose life !
and freedom for myself and the men !
how many times in battle have we snatched victory from the jaws of defeat ?
outnumbered , outflanked , yet still we triumph .
with you at my side , we can do so again .
lancelot , we are knights .
what other purpose do we serve if not for such a cause ?
arthur , you fight for a world that will never exist .
never .
there will always be a battlefield .
i will die in battle .
of that i' m certain .
and hopefully a battle of my choosing .
but if it be this one , grant me a favor .
don' t bury me in our sad little cemetery .
burn me .
burn me and cast my ashes to a strong east wind .
don' t touch their women .
we don' t mix with these people .
what kind of offspring do you think that would yield ?
weak people .
half people .
i will not have our saxon blood watered down by mixing with them .
according to our laws , no man may deny me the spoils of our conquest !
he speaks the truth , father .
my lord !
o , my lord !
god' s thanks , my lord .
thank you .
thank you .
kill her .
no !
no !
are you challenging me ?
lf you want to challenge me , you have to have a sword in your hand .
as long as my heart beats , i rule and you hold your tongue .
or i' il cut it out .
we are three days ' march from the great wall , if we camp at night .
we won' t camp .
the wall what troops are stationed there ?
light roman infantry and possibly sarmatian knights .
arthur castus is their leader .
arthur ?
who is this arthur ?
it is said he has never been defeated in battle .
it is said he is a great warrior .
why should i trust you ?
you' re a traitor to your own people .
tell my father of the roman estate .
speak up !
a very high ranking family live there .
they are of great importance to rome .
father , their ransom could pay for the entire campaign .
i' il attack from the north with the main army .
you bring your men down here .
cut off their retreat to the south .
burn every village , kill everybody .
never leave behind you a man , woman or child who can ever carry a sword .
saxon .
how many ?
thousands .
woads .
they' re tracking us .
where ?
everywhere .
yaah !
get back !
get back !
this way !
yaah !
what are you waiting for ?
inish .
devil ghosts .
why would they not attack ?
merlin doesn' t want us dead .
we should have killed them , merlin .
there might be a purpose for artorius and his knights .
no !
he is our enemy !
so is the saxon !
oh , i can' t wait to leave this island .
lf it' s not raining , it' s snowing .
lf it' s not snowing , it' s foggy .
and that' s the summer !
the rain is good .
washes all the blood away .
doesn' t help the smell .
hey , bors , do you intend to take vanora and all your little bastards back home ?
oh , i' m trying to avoid that decision ... by getting killed .
dagonet , she wants to get married and give the children names .
women !
the children already have names , don' t they ?
just gilly .
it was too much trouble , so we gave the rest of them numbers .
that' s interesting .
and i thought you couldn' t count .
you know , i never thought i' d get back home alive .
now i' ve got the chance , i ...
i don' t want to leave my children .
you' d miss ' em too much .
i' il take them with me .
i like the little bastards .
they mean something to me .
especially number three .
he' s a good fighter .
that' s because he' s mine .
i' m going for a piss .
who are you ?
i am arthur castus ,
commander of the sarmatian knights , sent by bishop germanius of rome .
open the gate .
it is a wonder you have come .
good jesus .
arthur and his knights .
you have fought the woads .
vile creatures .
our orders are to evacuate you immediately .
but that ... that is impossible .
which is alecto ?
i am alecto .
alecto is my son .
and everything we have is here in the land given to us by the pope of rome .
well , you' re about to give it to the saxons .
they' re invading from the north .
then rome will send an army .
they have .
us .
we leave as soon as you' re packed .
i refuse to leave .
go back to work !
all of you !
you heard !
go !
all right , all right .
go !
get back to work , all of you !
go back !
lf i fail to bring you and your son back , my men can never leave this land .
so you' re coming with me if i have to tie you to my horse and drag you all the way to hadrian' s wall myself .
my lord .
lady , my knights are hungry .
go .
come !
come .
let us go , hm ?
sir , you' re famous .
you' re arthur , aren' t you ?
i' m ganis .
i' m a good fighter and i' m smart .
i' d serve you proudly .
are you from rome ?
from hell .
sir .
who is this man ?
he' s our village elder .
what is this punishment for ?
answer me !
he defied our master , marius .
most of the food we grow is sent out by sea to be sold .
he asked that we keep a little more for ourselves , that' s all .
my ass has been snappin ' at the grass i' m so hungry !
you' re from rome . ls it true that marius is a spokesman for god and that it' s a sin to defy him ?
i tell you now .
marius is not of god .
and you , all of you , were free from your first breath !
help this man .
help him !
now hear me .
a vast and terrible army is coming this way .
they will show no mercy , spare no one .
those of you who are able should gather your things and begin to move south towards hadrian' s wall .
those unable shall come with us .
you , serve me now .
get these people ready .
right , you heard him .
you go grab enough food and water for the journey .
let' s get a hurry on , else we' re all dead !
come on , hurry .
they have flanked us to the east .
they' re coming from the south , trying to cut off our escape .
they' il be here before nightfall .
how many ?
an entire army .
and the only way out is to the south ?
east .
there is a trail heading east across the mountains .
it means we have to cross behind saxon lines , but that' s the one we should take .
arthur , who are all these people ?
they' re coming with us .
then we' il never make it .
come on , get back to work !
back to work !
move .
move .
move !
what is this ?
you cannot go in there .
no one goes in there .
this place is forbidden .
what are you doing ?
stop this !
arthur , we have no time .
do you not hear the drums ?
dagonet .
agh !
agh !
key .
it is locked .
from the inside .
you , you ... go .
move !
gawain .
exaudi orationem meam .
exaudi orationem meam .
in nomine dei patris omnipotentis et in virtute spiritus sancti .
who are these defilers of the lord' s temple ?
out of the way .
the work of your god .
ls this how he answers your prayers ?
see if there' s any still alive .
how dare you set foot in this holy place ?
there was a man of god .
not my god !
this one' s dead .
by this smell , they are all dead .
and you .
you even move , you join him .
arthur !
you must not fear me .
water !
give me some water !
his arm is broken .
and his family ?
she' s a woad .
i' m a roman officer .
you' re safe now .
you' re safe .
stop what you are doing !
what is this madness ?
they' re all pagans here !
so are we .
they refuse to do the task god has set for them !
they must die as an example !
you mean they refused to be your serfs !
you are a roman .
you understand .
and you are a christian .
you !
you kept her alive !
my lord !
no !
no , stop !
when we get to the wall you will be punished for this heresy .
perhaps i should kill you now and seal my fate .
i was willing to die with them .
yes , to lead them to their rightful place .
it is god' s wish that these sinners be sacrificed .
only then can their souls be saved .
then i shall grant his wish .
wall them back up .
arthur .
i said wall them up !
don' t you see it is the will of god that these sinners be sacrificed ?
unhand me , defil ...
they' re sinners !
get in there !
we' re moving too slow .
the girl' s not gonna make it , and neither is the boy .
the family we can protect , but we' re wasting our time with all these people .
we' re not leaving them .
lf the saxons find us , we will have to fight .
then save your anger for them .
ls this rome' s quest or arthur' s ?
arthur .
how is he ?
he burns .
brave boy .
some of your fingers are out of place .
i have to push them back .
lf i don' t do this , there' s a chance you may never use them again .
they tortured me .
with machines .
to make me tell them things that ... that i didn' t know to begin with .
and then ...
i heard your voice in the dark .
i am guinevere .
you are arthur ... of the knights from the great wall .
i am .
the famous briton who kills his own people .
i found tracks coming from the south , but none going back .
horsemen traveling light and fast .
could be roman cavalry .
could be knights .
they know we' re after them .
they' il head east now , through the mountains .
god' s holy work has been defiled .
i am a servant of god !
no , please , i ...
agh !
he says they walled him up in a building and took the family .
someone who goes by the name of artorius .
it' s him .
it' s arthur .
take your men east .
hunt them down .
i' il take the main army to the wall .
bring the family there .
and the monks ?
put them back where you found them .
i am a servant of god !
please , i ...
i am a servant of god !
unhand me , you defiler !
burn it all .
yah !
my father told me great tales of you .
really ?
and what did you hear ?
fairy tales .
the kind you hear about people so brave , so selfless , that they can' t be real .
arthur and his knights .
a leader both briton and roman .
and yet you chose your allegiance to rome .
to those who take what does not belong to them .
that same rome that took your men from their homeland .
listen , lady , do not pretend you know anything about me or my men .
how many britons have you killed ?
as many as tried to kill me .
it' s the natural state of any man to want to live .
animals live !
it' s a natural state of any man to want to live free in their own country .
i belong to this land .
where do you belong , arthur ?
how' s your hand ?
i' il live , i promise you .
ls there nothing about my land that appeals to your heart ?
your own father married a briton .
even he must have found something to his liking .
we' il sleep here .
take shelter in those trees .
tristan .
you wanna go out again ?
yeah .
it is here , given to us by the pope .
these people , they send an army for us .
you betrayed me .
he means you no harm .
peace between us this night , arthur castus .
so rome is leaving .
the saxon is come .
the world we have known and fought for is ended .
now we must make a new world .
your world , merlin , not mine .
i shall be in rome .
to find peace ?
the saxon will come to rome .
my knights trust me not to betray them to their enemy .
rome was my enemy , not arthur .
we have no fight between us now .
you tell that to the knights you killed before my eyes , whose bones are buried in this earth .
we have all lost brothers .
you know nothing of the loss i speak !
shall i help you remember ?
an attack on a village .
the screams of an innocent woman .
mother !
artorius !
mother !
mother !
i ran to the burial mound ofmy father to free her .
to kill you .
father , please let loose your sword .
i feel the heat of that fire on my face even now .
i did not wish her dead .
she was of our blood , as are you .
lf you were so determined to leave us to slaughter , why did you save so many ?
my men are strong , but they have need of a true leader .
they believe you can do anything .
to defeat the saxon we need a master of war .
why do you think i spared you in the forest ?
that sword you carry is made of iron from this earth , forged in the fires of britain .
it was love of your mother that freed the sword , not hatred of me .
love , arthur .
seize him !
no !
no ...
i have the boy !
kill him !
no , don' t !
let him go !
kill him now !
down !
hah !
your hands seem to be better .
artorius !
do we have a problem ?
huh ?
you have a choice .
you help or you die .
put down your weapons .
do it now !
yeah !
how many did you kill ?
four .
not a bad start to the day !
armor piercing .
they' re close .
we have no time .
you ride ahead .
i' m sorry for your loss .
my father lost his way .
he used to say the church is there to help us stay on our path .
it didn' t help those he made suffer .
the path he chose was beyond the reach of the church , alecto .
but not of rome .
what my father believed , so rome believes .
what , that some men are born to be slaves ?
no , that isn' t true .
it is so !
he told me so .
pelagius , a man as close to me as any , is there now , teaching that all men are free , equal .
and that each of us has the right to choose his own destiny .
teach ?
how ?
they killed pelagius a year past .
germanius and the others were damned by his teachings .
they had him excommunicated and killed .
the rome you talk of doesn' t exist , except in your dreams .
ls there any other way ?
no .
we have to cross the ice .
get them all out of the carriages .
tell them to spread out .
knights ...
well , i' m tired of running .
and these saxons are so close behind my ass is hurtin ' .
never liked looking over my shoulder anyway .
be a pleasure to put an end to this racket .
and finally get a look at the bastards .
here .
now .
jols !
you two , take the horses .
ganis , i need you to lead the people .
the main saxon army is inland , so if you track the coastline till you' re well south of the wall , you' il be safe .
but you' re seven against 200 ?
eight .
you could use another bow .
i' d rather stay and fight .
you' il get your chance soon enough .
this man is now your captain .
you do as he says .
am i understood ?
yes , sir .
go .
go !
right .
come on , then !
move on !
i am able .
i can fight .
no .
you must bear witness to all you have seen .
there' s one thing you must do , and that' s get back to rome .
hold until i give the command .
you look frightened .
there' s a large number of lonely men out there .
don' t worry , i won' t let them rape you .
archer !
we' re out of range .
i can see that !
i believe they' re waiting for an invitation .
bors , tristan .
they' re far out of range .
aim for the wings of the ranks .
make them cluster .
hold the ranks !
hold the ranks !
hold the ranks !
hold the ranks !
hold the ranks !
hold the ranks !
hold the ranks , or i kill you myself !
it' s not gonna break .
back .
fall back !
prepare for combat .
aagh !
dag !

archers move !

yaagh !

the ice is breaking !
yaagh !

aagh !
argh !
stay with me .
dagonet !
stay with me !
ah , god !
christ be praised .
against all the odds satan could muster .
alecto , let me see you .
kindly get out of my way !
you have triumphed !
young alecto , let me see you .
you are here .
lucan !
you , boy !
stop !
our great knights .
you are free now !
give me the papers .
come , come .
your papers of safe conduct throughout the roman empire .
take it , arthur .
bishop germanius .
friend of my father .
you are free now .
you can go .
bors .
bors !
for dagonet .
this doesn' t make him a free man .
he' s already a free man .
he' s dead !
a grave with no sword .
it was my father' s wish that if he died on this island , he would be buried with his knights .
he died in battle ?
it' s a family tradition .
i can see why you believe that you have nothing left here .
except what you and your knights have done .
you have your deeds .
deeds in themselves are meaningless unless they' re for some higher purpose .
we have waged a war to protect a rome that does not exist .
ls that the deed i am to be judged by ?
you stayed and fought when you didn' t have to .
you bloodied evil men when you could have run .
you did all that for no reason ?
these are your people .
arthur , come to the wall now .
the saxons are here .
make way !
make way !
knights , my journey with you must end here .
may god go with you .
arthur , this is not rome' s fight .
it is not your fight .
stand fast !
all these long years we' ve been together , the trials we' ve faced , the blood we' ve shed .
what was it all for , if not for the reward of freedom ?
and now when we are so close , when it is finally within our grasp ...
look at me !
does it all count for nothing ?
you ask me that ?
you who know me best of all ?
then do not do this .
only certain death awaits you here .
arthur , i beg you !
for our friendship' s sake , i beg you !
you be my friend now and do not dissuade me .
seize the freedom you have earned and live it for the both of us .
i cannot follow you , lancelot .
i now know that all the blood i have shed , all the lives i have taken have led me to this moment .
what tomorrow brings ... we cannot know .
artorius !
rus !
rus !
the roman auxiliary has left the wall .
and the horsemen ?
leading a caravan away from the fort .
they' re running south ... with their tails between their legs .
so there will be no resistance .
a few dozen villagers .
we' re going to slaughter your people .
i think you should watch .
your tree might be a good place .
up on the hill !
a single knight .
didn' t you just say they were gone ?
what is this , a ghost ?
one man .
a tiny fly on the back of your ... great army .
who is he ?
arthur .
arthur .
arthur .
arthur .
hm .
wherever i go on this wretched island i hear your name .
always half whispered , as if you were a ... god .
all i see is flesh , blood .
no more god than the creature you' re sitting on .
speak your terms , saxon .
the romans have left you .
who are you fighting for ?
i fight for a cause beyond rome' s or your understanding .
ah .
you come to beg a truce .
you should be on your knees .
i came to see your face , so that i alone may find you on the battlefield .
and it would be good for you to mark my face , saxon , for the next time you see it , it will be the last thing you see on this earth .
ah .
ah , finally .
a man worth killing .
ah !
prepare the men for battle .
whoa .
easy .
whoa .
whoa .
shh .
shh .
hey .
you' re free .
he' s got a plan , this roman .
send what' s left of your infantry .
do you want to kill my men ?
they' re my men !
no .
you stay here with me .
knights , the gift of freedom is yours by right .
but the home we seek resides not in some distant land .
it' s in us and in our actions on this day .
lf this be our destiny , then so be it .
but let history remember that as free men we chose to make it so .
rus !
hah !
argh !
there !
on the hill !
rus !
aargh !
raewald .
the left flank .
you go with him .
move out !
shields up !
argh !
pull !
aagh !
argh !
arthur ...
it was my life to be taken !
not this !
never this !
my brave knights , i have failed you .
i neither took you off this island , nor shared your fate .
for 200 years , knights had fought and died fora land not ourown .
but on that day at badon hill , all who foughtput ourlives in service ofa greatercause .
freedom .
arthur .
guinevere .
our people are one .
as you are .
now i' m really gonna have to marry your mother .
who said i' d have you ?
king arthur !
hail , arthur !
let every man , woman , child bear witness that from this day all britons will be united in one common cause .
arthur !
arthur !
artorius !
and as for the knights who gave theirlives , theirdeaths were cause forneithermourning norsadness .
for they will live forever , theirnames and deeds handed down from father to son , mother to daughter , in the legends of king arthurand his knights .
