like , selling antiques .
and she used to work for the mayor' s office as an advisor .
but she said she didn' t like it .
so ...
wow , two careers already .
yeah .
so i thought that she would understand , you know , the kinda work that you gotta put in when you' re first startin ' out .
but ...
she said that she couldn' t be number three or number four on someone' s list of priorities .
she said she could be number two , but not if number one was selling diapers .

where we goin ' ?
we' re headin ' north .
i' ve been killin ' myself at work .
nights , weekends .
even at home .
well , bridget' s home .
see , i moved in with her .
that was my big mistake right there .
i shoulda stuck with the plan .
i mean , the plan was working .
you know , the irony of it is that bridget actually loves plans .
we used to go on these trips .
she would plan everything down to , like , the very last detail .
i mean , like , including the gas station that we were gonna stop at .
i remember this one time ... ... we were in ashland , right ?
we were at this b& b station , right ?
and it starts raining , right ?
and i' m not talkin ' about regular rain .
it was like torrential downpour rain .
so bridget comes up with this great idea , right ?
park the car in the car wash .
because who' s gonna wash their car when it' s raining ?
come on .
do you want something ?
just ... just pick something .
did you buy the whole store ?
want some pie ?
you want some cheetos ?
oh , look at the moon .
let' s pull over .
did you love him ?
peter ?
no .
maybe a little .
do you love bridget ?
yeah , i guess so .
well , do you or don' t you ?
i thought i did .
well , if it wasn' t love , it was a lot like it .
ok , now i don' t know .
sounds stupid when i say it out loud .
honestly , if you' re not willing to sound stupid , you don' t deserve to be in love .
take this .
what ?
what was that ?
what ?
that .
i didn' t hear anything .
oh , my god !
oh !
oh , my god .
are you ok ?
ollie , are you all right ?
ok , i' m freezing ...
whoa , you just looked .
no , i didn' t .
you said you weren' t gonna look .
i didn' t look .
go .
i looked .
ooh , looking good .
shut up .
ooh , very nice .
you' re just taking advantage of me right now .
come on .
ok , the shutter' s gonna stay open for 40 seconds .
you have to keep very still , ok ?
ok .
are you ready ?
ready .
ooh !
ow !
ow !
ooh , it' s cold .
hi .
no moving .
you' re moving .
i can' t help it .
folks , can i talk to you out here for a second ?
folks .
folks , this is a national park .
why don' t you get back in your clothes , back in your car and back on the highway .
have a nice day .
i gotta go .
ok .
so anyway , we got this big vc meeting in new york .
gotta put on this big dog and pony show .
you know what vc is , right ?
no .
it' s venture capital .
it' s like a big influx of cash , to really help us grow our business .
it sounds exciting .
i' il grab this .
i got it , i got it .
well ...
you got my number .
and you' ve got mine .
yes , i do .
so i' il let you know how things go ... in new york .
oh , yeah , yeah .
good .
i' ve still got some ... some , like , feelings to sort through .
about ...
bridget ?
yeah .
i didn' t forget .
it' s " bridget .
i ...
it' s ...
it' s ok .
is it ?
yeah .
i met someone .
you met someone ?
yeah , i mean , it' s not like we' re getting married or anything , but ...
wait , i' m ...
i' m confused .
this ... this is someone different ?
not the writer guy ?
yeah , no , a different guy .
a new guy .
a different guy ?
what ?
i don' t ...
you know , it' s ...
thank you .
so ...
don' t .
you' il ruin it .
get outta here , i' m sick of you .
pitch and go .
pitch and go , keep up the pace .
it' s not a big deal .
i' m sorry .
it actually is quite a big deal .
but don' t go too fast .
ollie , you get really jittery when you go too fast .
and i need to make sure that you don' t speed through the whole thing in such a way that nobody understands exactly what you' re saying .
because we invested a lot of time , and everything that we' re that we' re do ...
jeet o , i need you to shut up .
all right ?
this is exactly what i' m talkin ' about .
you' re driving me crazy .
so ... ... the baby ...
the ...
client .
the client inputs the child' s data and the baby actually tracks its growth .
so when it' s time to move up to a bigger size ...
there it is .
bam .
just on your doorstep .
no hassle , no fuss .
does the baby have a name ?
does the baby have a name ?
yes .
what were we saying for the baby' s name ?
freddy .
freddy .
doesn' t have to be fred .
gabe ... was another choice that we came up with .
gabe the babe .
my point is , is that there are 10, 000 babies born every hour .
that' s 254, 000 babies a day .
and somebody' s gotta figure out where to put all that shit .
i wanna be that guy .
10, 000 babies an hour .
wouldn' t that be 240, 000 babies a day ?
yes .
it was good , ollie .
you were great .
i mean , there was that one little thing , but i don' t think it was a big deal .
how about you ?
you think it was good ?
great .
it' s mine .
hey , i' m jeeter .

there' s this kid , ok ?
and he' s in his backyard and he' s digging a hole .
and the neighbor lady looks over the fence and says ,
what you doing over there , little johnny ?
and the kid looks really sad and he says , " well , my goldfish died .
and so i' m having a funeral for it .
and the lady says ,
well , that' s an awfully big hole for a goldfish .
and little johnny says .
well , that' s because he' s inside your stupid cat .
you know , that' s terrible .
thank you .
