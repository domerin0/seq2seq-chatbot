motherfucking cocksucker .
motherfucking shit fucker . !
what am i doing ?
what am i doing ?
i don' t know what i' m doing .
i' m doing the best that i can .
i know that' s all i can ask of myself .
but is that good enough ?
is my work doing any good ?
is anybody paying attention ?
is it hopeless to try and change things ?
the african guy' s a sign , right ?
because if he isn' t ... then nothing in this world makes any sense to me .
i' m fucked .
maybe i should quit .
don' t quit .
maybe i should just fucking quit .
don' t fucking quit .
i don' t know what the fuck i' m supposed to fucking do anymore .
ducker .
duck !
shit !
i' m glad we saved a piece of this marsh .
i know it' s small , but at least it' s something .
don' t stop fighting .
we' re going to save a lot more of this place .
to celebrate , i have a poem i' d like to read .
nobody sits like this rock sits .
you rock , rock .
the rock just sits and is .
you show us how to just sit here , and that' s what we need .
yeah , we did it .
any press come ?
yeah , local paper' s here .
what' s wrong ?
nothing .
it' s just i have an appointment to check out this african guy .
what african guy ?
exactly .
what african guy ?
come on .
hello .
albert markovski .
i have a 1 : 00 appointment .
sorry , i' m late .
this place is like a maze .
have a seat .
we' il be right with you .
why don' t you just tell me what your situation is .
look , i' m not really sure i know exactly what you guys do here , all right ?
well , we , uh we' il investigate and solve your case .
how ?
if you sign a contract , we' il follow you .
you' il spy ?
yes .
on me ?
yes .
will you be spying on me in the bathroom ?
yes .
in the bathroom ?
yes .
why ?
there' s nothing too small .
you know when police find the slightest bit of d. n. a. and build a case ?
if we might see you you floss or masturbate ... that could be the key to your entire reality .
so i' m hiring you to spy on me .
that' s right .
so we can figure out your situation and resolve your crisis .
in addition , my associate will approach your case from a different angle .
what do you mean a different angle ?
what does that mean ?
regarding your perception of reality .
he' il tell you about that .
who sent you here ?
nobody .
i found your card .
where ?
in some fancy restaurant that i' d never been to before .
i didn' t have the proper attire .
so they let me borrow a suitjacket .
i reached into my pocket , and there was your card .
the weird thing is i always have a jacket .
but not that day ?
no .
brad stand .
hey .
kind of a coincidence .
yes , exactly .
my case is a coincidence .
about the restaurant and thejacket ?
no , no .
that that' s
i' m talking about a big coincidence .
it involves one man .
it' s a three parter .
okay .
ready ?
dirst part .
i went to a place called schottinger' s photo archives .
i was there getting stills of early bob dylan .
in comes this tall african guy .
he' s like 1 8 years old or something .
you know , he' s in there getting photos of morris chestnut ...
shaquille o' neal , jim carrey .
he' s an autograph hound .
kind of guy likes to get ... glossies of famous people and get them signed .
two weeks later , i see the same african guy .
he' s working as a doorman at my friend' s building .
oh , my god !
who' s your friend ?
jay wendorff .
but it' s not his apartment .
it' s his girlfriend' s .
what' s her name ?
uh , kelly .
kelly coulter .
so , okay , that' s two .
one time at schottinger' s photo archive ... second time as the doorman .
third , i see this man , he' s in a van at the mall .
what are you doing at the mall ?
i' m working .
i' m making a statement for the open spaces .
yeah , he' s back .
you crazy bastard .
you don' t plant no tree in this parking lot !
i gotta come take that tree , remove it and let traffic through .
you' rejust creatin ' more work for me .
they' re not always meaningful .
yeah , it' s meaningful .
meaningful how ?
that' s what i want you to find out .
about your life .
yeah , about my life .
and about the whole thing .
about the universe , you know ?
the big one .
i mean , should i keep doing what i' m doing ?
is it hopeless ?
mr. markovski , we see a lot of people in here ... who claim they want to know the ultimate truth about reality .
they want to peer under the surface at the big everything ... but this can be a very painful process full of surprises .
it can dismantle the world as you know it .
that' s why most people prefer to remain on the surface of things .
maybe you should go home .
let sleeping dogs lie .
take it easy .
what do you say ?
i say don' t give me the brush off .
please .
i want to know .
this is big .
have you ever transcended space and time ?
yes .
no .
uh , time not space .
no , i don' t know what you' re talking about .
i take it you don' t make very much money , mr. markovski .
is that gonna be a problem ?
are you expensive , what you do ?
we have a sliding scale .
some of our clients pay $30 a week .
some of our wealthy clients pay several thousand a week .
i can' t believe you guys actually exist .
how long have you been doing this ?
seventeen years , 352 cases .
that' s crazy .
i' m gonna have to ask you to please steer clear of my office ... because my work situation is a little shaky , all right ?
you want us to stay away from your job ?
yeah .
if you come snooping around my office ... it could make me look unstable and it could hurt me .
i want you to meet my colleague .
bernard ?
uh huh .
this is mr. markovski .
hi .
he' s going to have to be pro bono .
okay .
sounds good .
thank you very much for taking on my case .
oh , you' re welcome .
you' re welcome .
hold on .
he hasn' t signed a contract .
let' s do this and then we' il get to the contract .
it' s too much too soon .
it' s always too much too soon .
that' s the nature of the beast .
approach , patience , finesse .
will you stop ?
come on .
we need to start with his specifics , bernard .
we need to go past logic though .
come on .
let' s go .
give me a kiss .
come on .
okay .
will you tell me where we' re having dinner tonight ?
korean barbecue .
really ?
okay , let' s get started .
is this part of my investigation ?
yes .
say this blanket represents all the matter and energy in the universe , okay ?
you , me , everything .
nothing has been left out , all right ?
all the particles , everything .
what' s outside this blanket ?
more blankets .
that' s the point .
blanket' s everything .
exactly .
this is everything .
let' s just say that this is me , all right ?
and i' m , what , 60 odd years old and i' m wearing a gray suit .
blah , blah , blah .
and let' s say over here , this is you .
and , you' re i don' t know , you' re 21 .
you got dark hair , etc .
and over here , this is vivian , my wife and colleague .
then over here , this is the eiffel tower , right ?
it' s paris .
and this is a war .
and this is , uh , a museum .
and this is a disease .
and this is an orgasm .
and this is a hamburger .
everything is the same even if it' s different .
exactly .
but our everyday mind forgets this .
we think everything is separate .
limited .
i' m over here .
you' re over there .
which is true .
but it' s not the whole truth because we' re all connected .
because we ... are connected .
sure .
sure .
sure .
sure .
okay ?
yeah .
all right , now , we need to learn ... how to see the blanket truth all the time .
right in the everyday stuff .
and that' s what this is for .
why ?
why what ?
why do i need to learn how to see the blanket thing all the time in the everyday stuff ?
you wouldn' t want to miss out on the big picture , would you ?
uh uh .
that' s partly why you' re here , right ?
and this is it .
i' m talking about it right now .
it will take a while for you to get it , you know ?
but ... it will help you .
how ?
when you get the blanket thing you can relax ... because everything you could ever want or be , you already have and are .
that sound pretty good ?
that sounds very good .
all right , get in .
you want me to get in ?
so , get in here ?
yeah .
what' s going to happen to me in there ?
oh , hey , you' re gonna see .
you' il find out .
the purpose of this suit , mr. markovski , is to help shut down ... your everyday perceptions and give up your usual identity ...
that you think separates you from everything .
this room , this street ... this town , this country , this economy ... this history , this planet .
your body , your senses, yourjob .
everything that you identify with .
hey , man .
how' s it going ?
you' re an asshole .
we will fucking destroy you , deary .
got shaquille o' neal .
i like shaq .
hey .
brad stand .
hey , how are you ?
so what' s the open spaces take on that ?
well , i think you guys can definitely rebuild in areas ... that are already run down instead of tearing up new land .
new land .
new land .
we' re open to that .
that' s who we are at open spaces .
we can' t throw that away .
we' re not asking you to throw that away .
i' m not gonna bullshit you , right ?
part of this is we took a beating in the press for all our growth .
opening so many stores in such a short time .
so if we work with you and your open spaces coalition ... is that gonna help the huckabees image ?
yes .
does it help me ?
yes .
do i benefit from getting some great p. r. for huckabees when we need it ?
absolutely .
but do i care about saving the open spaces ?
yes , i do .
don' t look at me .
what' s wrong with you ?
beat it , you little pussy .
what' s wrong with you ?
pussy .
you' re an asshole .
how are you ?
okay ?
you doing okay ?
i thought you said that was going to relax me .
eventually , but you have to practice at home .
okay ?
you got a lot of layers in there , don' t you ?
huh ?
all right ?
yeah .
okay .
how am i supposed to practice at home ?
i don' t have one of these .
it doesn' t matter .
what you can do it
just use an eye mask or shut your eyes , okay ?
oh .
oh .
um , hi .
what should i be doing ?
whatever you normally do .
i wanted to thank you for what you did with the oak tree .
i played in that tree when i was little .
i thought we had a chance ...
but they chopped it to pieces .
hi .
i have some questions ... about power lines over the playground where my daughter goes to school .
please call me .
i' m marjorie at 96
hey , we got to talk , man .
hey , what' s going on ?
where is everybody ?
brad moved the meeting .
he what ?
to huckabees corporate .
listen .
okay .
i want you to do this .
i want you to get me the national office on the phone right now .
call orrin spence and tell him that brad is trying to hijack my coalition .
this should' ve gone to the other chapter a week ago .
i want those flyers ...
outta the parking lot .
it' s a free country .
the poems work .
oh , you are pissing people off .
oh , no , i' m not .
yeah , you really are .
you' re pissing people  no , i' m not .
if my poems had gone out with the shania mailing , it' d be a different story .
you know what ?
you' re not leading this coalition anymore .
i am the coalition .
i wrote the charter .
uh huh .
not for long .
tell him it' s important .
i' m not going to any meeting at huckabees .
i can' t get ' em .
can you just keep trying ?
just keep trying .
orrin spence .
brad cannot do this to us , all right ?
how can she get you out of the charter , man ?
she can' t !
this is my work situation , the one i was telling you about .
it' s a little
i' il describe it later to you if we could just
don' t worry , albert .
we' re gonna knock that meeting on its ass .
copy these and get these out .
you' re fighting suburban sprawl and this fellow , brad stand , and you have had a falling out .
remember , i told you not to come by my work ?
oh , yes , i remember .
now , tell me , did the coalition inspire the poetry ?
or did the poetry inspire the coalition ?
this is looking weird .
can we schedule a time when you can come by ?
this thread of your
this has nothing to do with my coincidence .
my coincidence has to do with an african man .
viv . !
viv . !
mr. corn is having a crisis .

gotta piece together a theory ?
this isn' t cool .
what ?
what ?
listen , you go visit mr. corn .
his wife is leaving him .
i think i' ve got a really hot lead , bernard .
albert , the universe is an infinite sphere whose center is everywhere ... and whose circumference is nowhere .
well , how can the center be everywhere if
she just dove into the back of angela' s car .
you gotta keep using the method .
i gotta check on on , uh , mr. corn right now , okay ?
that method works .
don' t forget to use it , all right ?
mmm .
mmm !
mm .
jimbo , everything on this lawn goes .
the microwave , the coffee grinder .
baby !
baby , come on .
don' t do this , please .
hey , don' t do this .
you don' t need anyone .
that' s not true .
i need you guys .
if nothing matters , how can i matter ?
i don' t know if nothingness matters or somethingness matters .
i' m trying to figure that out and i want you to help me .
somethingness , nothingness .
you know what ?
i i i you figure it out .
let go !
let go of me !
okay , uh , hold on now .
tell me what happened .
okay ?
she won' t stay and share this with me .
t tell me what that is .
it' s important to me .
i see it so clearly .
yeah ?
you use petroleum , you' re a murderer .
that' s a fact .
yes , yes , yes .
murderer .
a murderer ?
one killin ' the ozone and all the creatures that it' s hurting ?
calm down .
two killing arabs in oil producing dictatorships ... where everybody is poor that is cruelty and it' s inhumane .
you' ve talked to me about this .
so if this world is temporary ...
yeah . identity is an illusion ...
yeah . then everything is meaningless and it doesn' t matter if you
no .
it  that' s got me very confused .
no , it matters .
it matters .
it matters .
look , tommy .

no , no .
we would never give you this book .
you didn' t send this ?
caterine vauban' s full of shit .
what is she doing here ?
god , she never leaves paris .
this is insane .
this is a pretty good book .
you should read this .
what ?
she says nothing' s connected , doesn' t matter what you do ... you can drive a car , you can burn up gas ...
yeah ? which would explain the way things actually are ... where people do destructive things like it doesn' t matter .
tommy , tommy , everything is connected and everything matters .
there' s not an atom in our bodies ... that has not been forged in the furnace of the sun .
now , isn' t that cool ?
huh ?
yes .
that' s a cool thing , isn' t it ?
but

you tell me where she contradicts that .
oh , right here .
where ?
where ?

you know  there you go .
that means we' re all alone ... and we' re miserable and isolated .

yeah , my closet .
indonesia .

baby , this is the truth , okay ?
little girls like you , they have to work in dark factories ... where they go blind for $1 . 60 a month just to make mommy her pretty shoes .

i don' t want the children to work in factories !
don' t listen , honey .
daddy is crazy .
daddy' s not crazy , baby .
the world is crazy .
it' s important to ask questions .

i' m with shania .
we' re opening a megastore down by the loop .
shania' s there promoting her apparel , right ?
it' s 4 : 00 and she' s starving .
so i order a ton of tuna fish sandwiches , no mayo .
stop it . !
tick , tick , tick , tick , tick .
shania hates mayo , all right ?
and she can' t eat chicken salad .
that' s no joke , all right ?
we gave it to her once , she threw up in the limo .
she' s vomiting all over the limo .
the lady hates chicken salad .
so i bring out a bunch of tuna fish sandwiches .
she still doesn' t believe me .
i say , " shania , i' m allergic to mayo .
which , by the way , is a lie .
he loves mayo . !
he loves it .
shania still doesn' t believe me so i eat two of the sandwiches in front of her to prove it .
so she eats one and a half sandwiches .
one and a half sandwiches ... before she realizes ... it' s chicken salad .
and she actually likes it .
she did not vomit .
he made her change her mind .
and that' s what they want upstairs in corporate , okay ?
excuse me ?
can i help you ?
shh .
shh .
shh .

yes , i' m here for the open spaces meeting with brad stand .
okay , well , then you are in the wrong area entirely .
come on .
i' il show you where to go .
you' re very , very helpful .
thanks a lot .
there' s no reason for you to be up here .
this is an executive private floor .
it' s for come on .
let' s pick it up .
heel to toe .
unless you' re an executive or an executive' s assistant ... or someone who is a
no .
no , ma' am .
shania has no song for you .
let' s move it along this way .
you' re supposed to be on another floor .
security is very tight in this building .
or at least i thought it was very tight in this building .
of course , every now and then we get somebody ... who gets off on the wrong floor .
and then people flitting about
at huckabees , the everything store .
let me try that one more time .
i i okay .
tops and mops .
50 % off all women' s shirts and hair products .
this week only .
at huckabees , the everything store .
uh , dawn , can we do it one more time ?
i think we can do it better .
i suck , daryl .
i really sucked .
you' re doing great , dawn .
i can' t do this .
i can' t do it .
don' t give me that face .
i don' t know what' s wrong with me .
your voice is the trademark voice of huckabees .
oh , there she is . !
you' re one sneaky lady .
i was almost in the elevators .
we' re going now .
let' s move it along .
there we go .
i' il show you where you need to go .
moved my meeting to the huckabees corporation .
i saved this rock .
i' m going to save this place .
they' re not gonna save this place .
rat fucking bastard brad stand .
corporate prick bastard .
oh , motherfucking dickhead .
betrayed " by albert markovski .
is it possible for anybody in this world to work together to make it better ?
i don' t think so .
it was albert' s vision .
this whole thing was albert' s vision .
tell me about brad .
albert let him in , which was a mistake .
duck !
he has been enormously helpful [ man ]
he dropped albert' s poems from the benefit .
and the mailing .
settle down .
someone tell me about the woods and the marsh .
maryjane , this is your story .
why don' t you do it ?
my great grandfather owned the woods and the marsh .
we deeded them over to the municipality in 1 97 2 .
in perpetuity for the public .
tell me why .
we just wanted to share this beautiful place .
and now the town is looking at subclauses .
all of the sudden wants yet another mall ... and houses on this beautiful marsh .
so we' re fighting it .
we are fighting it .
we have to save the marsh .
sorry i' m late , guys .
i got the photo of the wetlands right here !
it looks beautiful !
here' s the marsh and woods we' re going to save .
this photo says good times and peace .
shania' s right here .
no silly poetry .
let the beauty speak for itself .
this is where the littlejack in the pulpits live .
an image is always better .
you' ve gotta reach people quick .
they don' t understand poems .
they don' t want to hear poems .
they have no time for them .
they think too much .
open spaces t' s for everyone .
maryjane .
extra small for your grandson , right ?
you shouldn' t have .
open spaces t' s and here is the schedule for the benefit .
dirst up , cocktails .
then , maryjane ... you introduce the marsh video , background story , animals , plants and stuff .
angela , you speak .
marty speaks for huckabees .
i speak .
then shania sings .
shania twain entertains us .
hi , have we met ?
no .
vivian jaffe .
brad stand .
she' s a perspective from
albert markovski .
sorry , that' s not gonna work .
what' s the matter with that ?
how are you connected ?
through an investigation .
i worry about that guy .
he alienates people .
what kind of investigation ?
existential .
i' d like to ask a few questions if you don' t mind .
actually we do .
we do because we' ve got to meet , and we' re a little late .
sounds kind of interesting though .
have you got a card ?
yes .
i don' t mean to give you a hard time .
existential ?
is that like a therapy ?
okay , let' s go , sneaky lady .
let' s step it outside .
i told you to stay away from my work situation . !
to solve your coincidence , we have to put it into context .
brad stand seems very important .
so you come by huckabees corporate and say you' re my fucking existential detectives ?
i' m lucky if i last another day !
we can solve your case sooner if you' re straight with us .
i' m being straight with you .
brad smeared me ... and took the coalition in a different direction .
that' s straight .
at schottinger' s photo archive where you met mr. nimieri
who' s mr. who' s that ?
the african guy .
that' s the african guy from my coincidence .
this is what i wanna talk about .
it wasn' t your first time at schottinger' s , was it ?
did i say it was ?
you did .
you agree it wasn' t ?
sure .
it wasn' t my first time .
big deal .
it was more like a regular thing with you .
and you weren' t finding a still of bob dylan .
you were planting photos of yourself in the archive .
what are you getting at ?
why would you do something like that ?
to be noticed .
maybe urgently .
maybe, yeah .
uh huh .
how did that affect things with brad at the coalition ?
how did it affect things at the coalition ?
i don' t know .
you know , it was a drag .
it really was a drag .
because i wanted my poems to go out with the fund raiser mailing .
brad didn' t .
he was all obsessed with shania and pete sampras .
not what we were really supposed to be focusing on hurt .
you planted photos of yourself and your poems at schottinger' s .
brad didn' t respect you .
no , he didn' t .
and yet you brought him into the open spaces coalition .
why is that ?
i needed the sponsor to take my cause to another level .
that' s why .
why else would i do it ?
like we said .
to be noticed .
this is absurd .
show me my folder .
no .
that is not productive .
at the photo archive , you spent a lot of time ...
looking at old jessica lange bathing suit stills , why ?
that' s only because lange comes before markovski .
i was putting my head shots under markovski , and then " l " is right before it .
i might' ve looked at a little bit of lange on the way out .
what' s the big deal ?
albert , baby , come on .
what , is it a crime ?
is it a crime to look at lange ?
have you ever been in love ?
what kind of question is that ?
do you even believe in love ?
or do you only have fantasy relationships ... because anything else would be too painful ?
bernard , excuse me .
but i' m making some progress here .
so am i , darling .
so am i.
oh , no , no .
i' m not going in that thing .
every time i go in there ... it' s all hating faces that i have to chop up with a machete .
and then they multiply .
and we' re going to address that right now .
okay ?
i' il leave it to you .
come on .
you can' t retreat .
back into the fray , albert .
let' s go .
i' m in your corner .
okay , albert , i want you to melt your usual identity like you did before .
stop looking at me .
i said stop looking at me .
dawn is gonna love doing spots for the open spaces .
who' s dawn ?
miss huckabees .
dawn .
she loves your poems .
the one about the rock .
nobody sits like this rock sits .
that' s the one .
she loves poems .
she loves forests , meadows , getting outside .
we' il just throw thejet skis on the trailer and head to the mountains .
wait , you guys you go with misshuckabees ?
she was doing some print work for us  [ bernard ]
albert ?
albert ?
forget brad .
come back to me .
where are you ?
where are you ?
albert .
picture a tree in a field .
good .
now put someone you respect in the tree .
hey , dickweed .
still brad stand .
add someone else .
like who ?
you know , someone who can understand things .
someone who can help you .
who' s your guide ?
well , i use magritte , a belgian surrealist .
i got someone .
who is it ?
mrs. schirmir .
she was my high school english teacher .
she helped me .
all right , good .
he pushed her out of the tree .
okay , mrs. schirmir has a vacuum cleaner , albert , that sucks up fear .
now she' s going to send you rays of security and complete acceptance .
he chopped her head off ! .
hold on .
hold on .
hold on .
you' re doing well .
now , don' t give up now .
didn' t she vacuum a lot ?
but then he vacuumed her .
i had to chop him up with a machete .
okay , albert .
i can let you in on a couple of secrets .
one , your mind is always occupied on something ... so it may as well be something helpful like mrs. schirmir and her vacuum cleaner .
two , there is no such thing as you and me .
so then there' s just nothing ?
three , there' s no such thing as nothing .
there is no remainder in the mathematics of infinity .
there' s only the blanket .
i thought i understood the blanket .
now i' m not sure .
flags and bags . !
huckabees says , " happy birthday , mr. president . " 50 % off all knapsacks and pocketbooks .
oh , say , can you see how good this looks ?
let freedom ring .
at huckabees ... the everything store .
huckabees cornucopia of stuff we all want .
but what happened to the gazelles ?
were they squashed ... under the cd department ?
hey , albert , how' s it goin ' ?
what are you doing here , brad ?
i met brad when i was investigating you .
he called with his own existential conundrum .
that' s all .
i' m really glad i found out about these people .
that' s bullshit .
he doesn' t care about things like this .
bring me the african guy .
where' s that african guy ?
dude , what' re you talking about ?
why does he get to write poetry ?
there' s no gazelles in north america .
just so you know .
and that building squashing nature is my imagery .
you don' t write poetry .
everyone' s intake procedure is different .
i asked brad to write a poem .
and it wasn' t enough that you came to my coalition ... now you have to come here and do okay , okay .
all right , that' s good .
we' re the same , brad .
it' s all the blanket .
there you go .
give it a shot .
that is wonderful , albert .
oh , honey , he' s got it .
how are things at the coalition , brad ?
great .
much smoother .
great , i look forward to coming back and working with you .
i don' t think that' s going to happen , my friend .
i' m still in the charter .
i built the coalition from scratch .
yeah .
yeah .
well , i don' t want to cramp you here .
that' s what you mean to do . !
that' s exactly what you mean to do . !
what ?
what ?
what ?
you see what he' s doing ?
tell them what you' re doing .
what ?
he' s come here to conquer you like he conquered my coalition .
and now he' s here today to unnerve me so that when orrin comes to town , i will blow it .
that' s what you mean to do .
albert , please . !
oh , my god , brad .
you' re killing me .
what are you talking about ?
what am i talking okay , when orrin comes , i' il blow it .
i' il get kicked out , and then he can do whatever he wants with the coalition .
who' s orrin ?
orrin is the open spaces national director .
he' s coming to review our charter .
i hope this isn' t about dawn .
he has a crush on my girlfriend .
that' s crazy !
why do you stare at her ?
she' s a model . !
i' m going home .
oh , no . !
albert , please .
stay with us for mancala hour .
i' m gonna have a fucking ball at mancala hour , aren' t i ?
maybe albert should meet his other .
what ?
tommy ?
no , that' s a bad idea right now .
yes , a dicey move .
maybe even dangerous , but potentially inspired .
bernard , give them both a connection .
maybe , but tommy' s in a bad direction .
it could spread to albert .
you said tommy was gonna be fine .
what are you leaving out ?
nothing .
give him his other .
it' s an inspired idea .
it' s groovy .
the connection will come back to us , bernard .
it all comes around .
like you say , take the long view .
long view .
what' s the other ?
we' re going to find out right now .
shh .
there was a drought .
there was no crop .
no olives .
no soul of life .
no rabbit in the oven .
we mashed locusts and made bread .
i have no idea what you guys are talking about .
i thought we were going to talk about petroleum .
mrs. echevarria visits us once a year from spain .
she' s sort of a little treat for our clients .
a kind of spiritual petit four .
something that would be useful for you to be accustomed to .
yeah , a real treat .
you have received your answer .
senorita , the petroleum situation was not created by nature ...
like the drought or the olives or any of that .
it was created by people , and this is the facts .
it was created by people who act like nothing' s happening ...
and that' s causing all the problems .
no , no , tommy .
one question only .
uno .
okay .
here' s the question  no , no .
i think
you' ve had your question and the answer , tommy , please .
senora is tired .
senorita , why do people only ask themselves deep questions ... when something really bad happens ?
then they forget all about it after .
right ?
how come people are self destructive ?
and third , i refuse to use petroleum ... but there' s no way i can stop its use in my lifetime , is there ?
jimmy carter would have a great electric car by now .
i could have a cadillac escalade , and it would be electric .
i wouldn' t have to ride on my bicycle .
that is three questions .
i paid my money and i want a fucking answer .
so just give me a second .
i know , dear boy .
we wanted you to meet albert .
i thought you said next week .
it turns out he can use a connection sooner than later .
tommy has been working with us since that
the big september thing .
he' s going to be your other .
what is it exactly ?
like a buddy system i think .
when we dismantle , it can get kind of rough .
and it helps ... to have a friend going through the same .
do you drive a car ?
a bike .
sometimes i take the bus .
good .
that' s good .
i like that .
i can see why they put us together .
tommy corn .
albert markovski .
i' il be your other .
join us for mancala hour .
come .
come .
gracias , senora .
what' s happening with your case ?
i don' t know .
what do you mean ?
they won' t let me see my coincidence file .
you want them to solve a coincidence ?
that' s why you came here ?
yeah , that' s why i came here .
who' s the girl ?
the face of huckabees .
tops and mops ?
that' s her .
i doubt your coincidence is meaningful .
why ?
i have a book by a drench thinker named caterine vauban .
she says the same thing they say here about dismantling your reality to see the big picture .
what' s the difference ?
here , they say everything' s connected in the blanket .
vauban says nothing' s connected .
it' s all random and cruel .
it doesn' t matter what you do .
that' s nihilism , tommy !
they find it threatening .
but it is very convincing .
you know , my ex girl won' t let me see my daughter .
she' s brainwashing her not to think or feel .
what kind of reality is that ?
not this one .
exactly .
i think you shouldjust look in your file if you want to .
how am i gonna look at my file ?
you wanna see your file ?
i' il distract them .
you slip in for it .
act naturally .
here comes your boy .
hey , you play mancala ?
didn' t know you were interested in existential issues , brad .
why ?
' cause i' m a dumb sales executive instead of a sensitive artist like you ?
no , i just never heard you talk about it .
that' s all .
why do you think i joined the open spaces coalition , man ?
i thought you cared about the issues .
i do .
obviously you had a different agenda , didn' t you ?
what books do you read ?
what books do i read ?
philjackson' s sacred hoops .
really .
i read the galleys when it arrived at huckabees , and you know what ?
seriously , that book' s got some good questions .
you should read it .
isn' t it sports questions in that book ?
no , wise ass .
philjackson' s a smart guy .
all right , come on .
it was an honest question , brad .
delt a little hostile .
i feel the same thing from him .
who the hell are you ?
who the hell are you ?
you wanna go ?
get out of here man .
hey , don' t be a jerk , buddy .
come on .
don' t be a
that' s funny !
he pushed him !
it is not funny !
hey , he assaulted me , man .
he tried to attack me .
hey !
i tried to you' re dancing with my girl .
yeah .
you wanna dance ?
no , i don' t wanna dance .
look at me .
come on .
what ?
you want to go at him , right ?
yeah .
no , i don' t want to go .
he grabbed my girl .
all right, you guys wanna have a go at each other , right ?
you wanna have a go at each other .
you want to go backwards ?
the reptiles have been eating each other for years .
you want to be back on all fours ?
right ?
primitive ?
come on . !
that' s spirit you wanna keep for the battles inside .
what are you doing ?
i , um
bernard the dismantling thing with the whole you know , all the poetry stuff
but i got it .
it' s no big deal .
because i got it now , okay ?
every relationship is possible , guys .
brothers , husbands , child .
security breach .
he broke into his file .
what did you do , albert ?
this is my investigation now . !
you think you know what you' re doing ?
you haven' t even begun ... to dismantle your identity or your fear .
albert' s gotta do what he' s gotta do .
anybody think they know better ?
want to take a shot ?
it' s my coincidence .
nobody ?
yeah , nobody .
sorry i grabbed you .
reptilian .
man , come on .
hey , is that him there ?
yeah , that' s him .
hey .
my goodness , it is you .
yeah , it' s me albert .
how are you ?
this is my friend tommy .
hey .
tommy corn .
how are you ?
this is the fourth coincidence ?
no , i came here on purpose .
i was wondering about our coincidences and what they mean .
we were just wondering if we spent time , maybe try to understand it .
perhaps you can be my guests for dinner .
that would be great , huh ?
yeah , that' d be great .
wait here .
i must ask my mom .
guys , guys . !
my ball . !
my ball . !
thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven .
give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses ... as we forgive those who trespass against us .
and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil .
dor thine is the kingdom , the power and the glory .
dorever and ever , amen .
amen .
steven , how' d you end up working as a doorman ?
it is our immigration agreement .
we must work .
the building supervisor hired steven as a member of our congregation .
he was so skinny .
skeleton man from africa .
skeleton man
what did we say about that ?
i don' t want to hear it again .
it' il be no internet tonight .
didn' t know what a can opener was .
he opened cans with a big knife like at the camp .
there aren' t lions roaming here but there were in sudan , and the orphan boys got chased .
and one time , a big alligator bit his friend' s head off .
it was a crocodile .
he wanted to know where all the meat comes from since he didn' t see any cows .
guys , that' s enough . !
albert , what brought you to the philosophical club ?
you mean the existential detectives ?
sounds like a support group .
why can' t he use a church ?
sometimes people have additional questions to be answered .
like what ?
well , um , for instance
if the forms of this world die , which is more real ... the me that dies or the me that' s infinite ?
can i trust my habitual mind or do i need to learn to look beneath those things ?
sounds like we got a philosopher .
we don' t have to ask those kinds of questions , do we , mom ?
no , honey .
what happened to the cat , albert ?
h how' d you know about my cat ?
the cat was killed by curiosity .
right .
that cat .
what do you do ?
i' m the director of the open spaces coalition .
we fight suburban sprawl .
what' s suburban sprawl ?
ask steven .
he could have used a little suburban sprawl in sudan .
excuse me , dad ?
industry , houses, jobs , restaurants , medicine
you can preserve a lot of open spaces and have jobs for people with
i beg your pardon , albert .
i wasn' t finished .
sorry , sir .
clothes , videos , toys , cheeseburgers , cars , a functioning economy .
you can still have a functioning economy and preserve open spaces with a little planning .
yeah .
socialism .
complete disaster .
theodore roosevelt was a socialist ?
and yeats ?
theodore roosevelt
henry david thoreau , robinson jeffers , the national geographic society , all socialists ?
you' re talking about socialism .
no , i' m not .
i' m talking about ... not covering every square inch with houses and strip malls ... until you can' t remember what happens when you stand in a meadow at dusk .
what happens in the meadow at dusk ?
everything .
nothing !
everything !
it' s beautiful .
it' s beautiful .
i work for an electrical engineering firm , son .
we do a lot of commercial and residential contracts .
if development stops , so does my paycheck .
then steven couldn' t be here as our guest , could he ?
so your ideas hurt steven .
i' m not hurting steven .
that' s an outrageous accusation .
don' t use that tone of voice in my house .
i think you started that tone .
and i think it' s entirely possible for your engineering firm to have jobs for people ... preserve open spaces , have contracts , do the
whoa .
whoa .
what' s he doing ?
why' s he closing his eyes ?
cricket , i don' t know .
do you have a job , tom ?
i' m a firefighter .
oh , god bless you .
a hero .
i' m not a hero .
we' d all be heroes if we quit using petroleum though .
excuse me ?
say you' re christians living byjesus ' principles .
are you ?
jesus is never mad at us if we live with him in our hearts .
i hate to break it to you , but he is .
he most definitely is .
all right .
that' s enough .
steven , i don' t know what this is about .
why they' re here
sorry , mom .
sorry , dad .
i did not know .
stevo , i' m so disappointed .
it' s all right .
look , he' s sad .
he' s sad .
i' m sorry , stevo .
my bad .
you didn' t know .
you should be ashamed of yourself .
i should be what ?
you should be ashamed of yourself .
why should i be ashamed ?
you' re a hypocrite .
i' m a what ?
you' re misleading these children .
' cause you' re the destroyer , man .
how am i the destroyer ?
i saw that s. u. v. out there .
my car' s the destroyer ?
you wanna know how many miles per gallon i get ?
steven , i need to ask a question .
it' s why i came here .
why are autographs so important to you ?
it is a pastime with this family which they have taught me .
which i can now carry on .
it' s just for fun .
for entertainment .
no games at the table , please .
yes .
260 .
and i' ve reached the omega level .
destroyer .
destroyer .
destroyer .
god gave us oil . !
he gave it to us . !
how can god' s gift be bad ?
he gave you a brain too and you messed that up pretty good
i want you sons of bitches out of my house now .
if hitler were alive , he' d tell you not to think about oil .
you' re the hitler !
we took a sudanese refugee into our home !
you did .
but how did sudan happen , ma' am ?
could it possibly be related to dictatorships ... that we support for some stupid reason ?
you shut up !
you get out .
you shut up .
come on .
let' s get out of here .
later , steve .
god bless you .
wow .
what' s going on in there ?
crazy .
i can' t believe them .
hi , guys .
oh , christ .
you guys get anything good in there ?
you didn' t , did you ?
you hesitated over the mention of a cat .
what does that mean ?
it means nothing . just like my coincidence .
cat seemed to hit a nerve .
yeah , i had a cat once .
you caught me .
you' re amazing .
the method worked .
i saw it .
it seemed to calm you down , right ?
what method ?
come on with that method .
that' s a tranquilizer so people don' t get pissed ... about the painful , ugly truth you know it .
no , tommy .
it penetrates a unified infinity of everything .
we' re not in infinity .
we' re in the suburbs .
infinity is everywhere .
that' s what makes it infinity .
okay , how does this connect ?
mr. nimieri' s an orphan from sudan ... who was chased by soldiers and crocodiles .
how does the love glow fit into that , man ?
it' s connected .
albert and mr. nimieri share a great deal .
it' s just that
oh !
oh , my god .
what' s she doing here ?
that' s caterine .
this is worse than i thought .
oh , it' s much worse .
the meeting' s going down at huckabees right now .
let' s go .
hey , everybody .
calm down .
the national office recognizes the charter .
we' re here today to give the director a chance to even the keel .
so just give him a break .
thank you , orrin .
okay , first director now .
silence .
excuse me .
dirst , i would like to apologize for my part of the fight ... that i had with brad stand a little while ago over the poems ... that did not go out with the shania mailing .
where' s brad ?
brad .
brad .
brad .
it' s all brad , brad .
the big benefit' s coming up with brad ... and brad' s running it and it' s going to go great .
so , look , we' re overlooking our core issues .
brad is not here .
so to get us back on track ...
i have a new poem i' d like to read .
point of order , please .
apoint of order .
i want to discuss this strategy of poems , which are getting us nowhere .
excuse me , ma' am .
ma' am .
poems are amazing , okay ?
they will help you and your mind transform .
who the hell are you ?
i' m with albert .
it will help you ... to transform your mind into thinking differently .
you guys need this , okay ?
this is great .
where' s brad ?
this is called ' an open meadow .
an open meadow , an open marsh in a cloudless sky .
boring .
a crane flies .
oh , brad' s here . !
look what i got you , maryjane .
oh , is that for my grandson ?
it most certainly is .
i' m talking here .
come on .
shit .
you know what ?
let me just finish reading my poem ... and then we' il review our strategy , okay ?
good job , albert .
can it be taped ?
excuse me , brad .
i would like to finish reading my poem , please .
thank you .
relax .
not doing your poem .
don' t give me the relax thing , brad .
let him read the poem , man .
he was in the middle of it .
that man is not in our coalition .
he has no right to be here and no right to speak .
no , ma' am , i' m not a member , but i am a local firefighter .
he' s a great firefighter and exactly who we want on our side .
i don' t know who these men are .
they' re not members of our coalition .
they' re working on the benefit .
they' re bringing a lot of support for our cause .
conflict is an illusion .
shut up , brad .
hey , albert , that' s not the way a director behaves .
why are you guys wasting all your time fighting each other ?
i mean , come on .
serious .
put the egos aside for a second , guys , please .
deal with this issues , okay .
we have a deadly petroleum situation , not to mention
shut up !
shut
cystic dibrosis .
civil war in africa .
toxic fish .
you have children in your own community going to prison .
dather dlavin doesn' t have the money to help them .
ma' am , listen to me .
this is exactly the unfocused , idealistic approach ...
by mr. markovski that' s killing us dead .
killing us dead .
our mission has nothing to do ... with this nut' s petroleum fixation .
what did you just call me ?
cystic toxic what ?
america wants to drive cars , right ?
i have a b. m. w. s. u. v.
and i like driving it .
i' m sorry .
excuse me .
you got to give me a chance , all right ?
this is my meeting .
i' m the director .
we gave you a chance .
you' re out of the charter .
he can' t be out of the charter .
he is the charter .
i wrote it .
marty , call security .
i think you should call
i move to vote .
second !
all in favor of brad becoming the new leader of the coalition , say aye .
aye . !
hey , come on .
that' s bullshit .
congratulations .
be strong .
be strong ' cause you' re going to be back .
don' t worry about those people .
they don' t appreciate you .
albert , what happened in there is reality .
it' s cruelty and it' s chaos .
the detectives are wrong .
what were you trying to do ?
you were trying to do a good thing , right ?
well , look what happened .
i' m going to the other side , albert .
i seriously suggest ... you consider coming with me ... as my other .
albert  you' re wrong !
you' re full of shit .
you guys got nothing to offer , man .
tommy , no
this is the money right now .
yes ?
no . !
you know how hurt you feel ?
this is the perfect opportunity to dismantle now .
stay away from me !
stop !
look !
listen !
throughout infinity ... your energy recycles into every possible relation ... to everyone else' s energy , even brad' s .
you' ve been predator and prey with him .
driends , enemies , brother , sister , mother , child .
i give and i give and i give ... and he takes and he takes and he takes .
mama .
all right , baby .
all right .
yahhh !
it' s a romantic fantasy .
and you left that part out , okay ?
when you were taking my cash .
i want it back .
yeah , and if i wasn' t pro bono , i' d want my money back too .
send it to my ex for my kids .
hey , sign your bike out .
sign your bike out !
tommy , come on !
go !
i' il block for you .
cocksucker !
motherfucking bitch ass motherfucking cocksucker !
you' re all a bunch of big babies !
maybe i should just quit .
i mean , what' s the point of life anyway ?
i can answer these questions for you .
you can ?
because i don' t think the other guys are doing such a hot job .
believe me , i can .
you' re the writer tommy' s into ?
are you unhappy with their work ?
yeah , i' m ready to cross over to your side .
tell me about your case .
well , you seem to be following me pretty closely .
why don' t you tell me about it ?
you are miserable .
obsessed with your strange coincidence .
yeah .
yeah , but they just want to talk about brad stand .
they betrayed you , as he did .
that' s right .
betrayal embodies the universal truth you seek .
what truth ?
cruelty , manipulation ... meaninglessness .
yeah .
did they follow you ?
no .
i lost them on route 4 .
thanks for helping me out back there .
no problem .
glad you' re here , albert .
this is the place to be .
once you realize the universe sucks , you got nothing to lose .
that' s what gives you la force .
the force ?
la force .
it' s drench for strength .
la force .
you guys got a method here ?
yeah .
deconstruct your mind to the blackness , okay ?
just accept it for what it is .
nothing .
there' s no glowing guys , no infinite mothers .
none of that bullshit .
my coincidence is meaningless , isn' t it ?
think , albert .
have you betrayed yourself ? .
wait a second .
what are we doing here ?
i don' t want to go to this building .
stop !
trust her , albert .
this is for you .
oh , thank you .
hey , hey , hey .
what did she give you ?
no , stay away from me .
i don' t want to talk to you .
thanks , steven .
well , this is a rare occasion .
where is she ?
who ?
caterine .
who' s caterine ?
the woman who' s spying on me .
where is she ?
i don' t think this is funny .
oh , god , here we go again .
what' s happening ?
he' s just making a joke on me .
are you making fun of your mother ?
no .
why can' t you get along with her ?
so , how' s your poetry job ?
i got fired from it .
oh , couldn' t even hold down a poetry job .
brenda , what the hell did you do ?
i didn' t touch it .
bullshit !
i have this programmed on my favorite stations on a timer .
can i please have some time with my son ?
i want to show him an article i have here on marketing internship .
you see this ?
that' s great , mom .
it' s right up my alley .
but it is .
it' s a new hot
i sent this to you .
why don' t you ever listen to me  have you seen this system ?
state of the art .
we got speakers all through the house .
but listen to this .
it' il be easier to talk now .
where did she come from ?
what' s going on ?
see , i wasn' t making a joke .
what' s her name ?
i would like to discuss some curious findings .
who is this lady ?
i found here in your apartment ... a rather troubling piece of evidence .
what evidence ?
do you recognize the handwriting , mr. markovski
excuse me , mr. silver ?
this is silly .
let' s go .
no .
i wanna go .
could you please read the date for me ?
november 1 7 , 1 989 .
albert was nine .
this is his journal .
would you mind reading this out loud ?
no .
please .
this stuff doesn' t matter .
let' s go .
oh , my god .
i came home from school .
mom was in the kitchen with a strange lady .
mom told me to go back to my room .
i thought i was in trouble .
she closed my door and said , ' purree got hit by a car and killed . '
' and then she took me back to the lady in the kitchen ...
and told me to spell words to show how i' m a good speller .
i said i had to go to the bathroom .
i climbed out the window .
i went down the block .
i saw barney playing punch ball .
he said i look sad .
i told him what happened to my cat .
he said , ' that' s sad . '
then i cried , but i tried not to show .
some of the kids laughed .
barney said he cried when his dog died .
and the kids stopped laughing .
his cat died .
he was sad .
what' s your point ?
nothing strikes you as odd ?
see ?
it' s nothing .
let' s go .
these things happen .
oui .
c' est vrai .
the universe is cruel .
but tell me this , mrs. silver , this lady you gave the coffee to
was helen' s sister .
i don' t remember her name .
i met her the once .
was there some painful thing about this stranger ... that required your immediate attention ?
no .
helen wasn' t home , so i offered her sister a cup of coffee .
but you agree that purree meant a great deal to albert ?
you can' t make a federal case out of the cat .
answer the question , please .
i don' t know much about the cat .
i traveled a lot for work .
we' re not talking about this anymore .
it' s embarrassing me .
precisely the point .
what ?
you were embarrassed for feeling sad about the death of your cat .
it' s painful enough to feel sad , but on top of it ... to feel embarrassed for feeling , that is the killer .
how is that my fault ?
i didn' t tell him to be embarrassed .
but you did .
it was more important to have a cup of coffee ... with a perfect stranger than to talk to albert ...
about what for a small boy is a large tragedy .
this is ridiculous .
he climbed out his window , a criminal in his own house .
why ?
i don' t know .
i think you do .
i don' t .
yes , you do .
oh , stop it !
i think you should go .
no , i will not go .
albert has a place here , a place you have denied .
this is my home .
i can tell him what i want .
yes, your home is a lie .
what does that mean ?
i gave my life to this selfish bas
so he could be an ornament to you , not a person .
god , what are you , a bitch ?
you' re a bitch .
how many kids do you have , bitch ?
listen .
listen .
this is your mother .
you asked me to come up here ?
what does the doorman have to do with this ?
he was orphaned by civil war .
you were orphaned by indifference .
this is but one part of your puzzle .
do you see ?
oh , now the timer' s all fucked up .
brenda . !
gee , is it that hard ?
go ahead and do it .
all i' m gonna do is listen  i spent what ?
i spent $2, 000 on this ?
i wanna listen to a radio !
i wanna listen to a radio !
thanks .
we' il meet you later by the rock .
i' m sorry , man .
i need , like , a minute to figure this out .
she had to get you to see .
see what ?
you were trained to betray yourself right here .
that' s why you betrayed yourself by going to brad .
why didn' t you figure this out ?
why didn' t you bring me here ?
because you lied to us .
you told us that the african guy ... was the the doorman at your friend' s building , not at your parents ' building .
you encrypted the truth .
that' s how good you are at betraying yourself .
right .
i told you that he wasn' t ready for infinity .
don' t start with that magic blanket bullshit , okay ?
it' s not magic .
it' s just the way things are .
you and me and the air are actually tiny particles ... that are swirling around together .
look right here .
you see ?
okay .
but look at the cracks ... between these particles and the cracks we fall through , the holes of nothingness .
exactly .
because that' s what i just experienced upstairs .
look closer .
there are tiny particles connecting the larger cubes .
yeah , and then tinier cracks between the connections .
and even tinier connections .
and even tinier cracks .
yeah , but if you look close enough , you can' t tell where my nose ends ... and space begins , because they' re unified .
see ?
so what ?
you can' t see any of this anyway !
do you see anything ?
no .
but i want to debate this particle cube thing .
you live all the time with things you can' t see .
you can' t see electricity , can you ?
you can' t see radio waves , but you accept them .
trust .
duck trust !
you better stay away from caterine , albert ...
' cause she' s gonna lead you down the path of darkness .
she was our prize graduate student till she went astray .
i think that i am gonna stay with her , the cracks , the pain , the nothingness ... because that' s more real to me , that' s what i feel .
word .
okay .
we' re not sweatin ' it .
no , we' re gonna work with brad .
it' il all come back to you ...
and interconnection .
brad ?
are you kidding me ?
i' m gonna work on that prick , and it' s all gonna come back to pain and no connection !
no .
it' s on .
we' il see .
we' il see .
ooh , damn .
come on .
oh , shit .
duck .
oh , look at this .
kafka .
he' s planting garbage for us .
kafka .
kafka .
look at that .
so fishy .
ooh , she found his poem .
oh , this is good .
i was hoping for a break like this .
don' t go in my den .
whoa .
whoa .
i' m not unhappy to be with you !
let me see this !
putting on a show .
can' t say no .
inside i' m drowning , sighing and frowning .
that doesn' t sound very happy to me .
does it sound very happy to you ?
i only wrote " frowning " to rhyme with " drowning .
then why did you need " drowning " ?
to rhyme with " frowning .
there there' s nothing in it .
what does that mean ?
look !
and why do they have to go through our yard and go through the garbage ?
what is he doing ?
stop that .
why is he sniffing my blouse ?
perspiration levels indicate stress , and that' s kind of high .
brad signed a rather comprehensive contract ... allowing unfettered access to your home .
well , it' s my home too , and i didn' t sign anything .
you' re going to have to work that out with brad .
the mortgage is in his name , and you' re not married .
are these from this year ?
last year .
we went to saint bart' s .
what about this year ?
we didn' t take a trip this year .
how come ?
too busy .
a lot of work .
too busy to go have fun ?
hon honey , why are you involved with this ?
you don' t believe in therapy .
no , see , i don' t see this as therapy .
i' m proactive .
these people are action oriented .
it' s like the company retreats at hilton head .
remember ?
no , hey .
get out of there .
hey !
hey !
no .
now , unfettered access .
remember last year , the trust thing ?
the paragliding ?
a quick look at your label .
it' s just like that .
no , it' s not like that !
this is
actually it is .
no , it is .
everything will end up nice .
it seemed like they were helping albert .
they can help me .
help the open spaces .
help huckabees .
what are you talking about ?
he did mention that in his application ... that he felt exhausted from having to constantly charm everyone ... but doesn' t see any alternative because
you need to get people to like you to be successful to get things done in this world .
end quote .
duh .
brad likes to be charming .
it comes naturally .
i only put those things in the garbage as a joke .
yeah , see ?
that' s funny .
back door way to charm .
that' s joking as a disguised request for approval .
that' s saying , ' joke , " but really love me .
joke , love me .
ms. campbell , how have you felt about being pretty ?
oh , please .
i don' t think of myself as being that pretty .
yes , that' s changed at huckabees , but , you know ...
i was never the pretty girl .
really ?
no .
i just have to keep up with this gorgeous hottie .
how' s the sex ?
how is the sex ?
the sex ?
come on , guys .
come on .
that' s private .
that' s gross .
a preliminary surveillance ... indicates it' s been infrequent and short eight to nine minutes ...
typically .
surveillance ?
you watched us ?
no, just listened .
so, your surveillance is wrong .
yeah .
it' s quantity , not quality .
what ?
she meant quality , not quantity .
i know .
i was onlyjoking .
were you joking ...
when you said quantity and not quality ?
in regards to sex ?
we' re not gonna discuss this .
we' re private about ...
our seven minutes of heaven .
it' s longer than that .
eight minutes of heaven !
it' s not quality , it' s quantity !
you oughta see her after a couple margaritas .
oh , my god !
i' m crying .
honey  what is it ?
why did you have to write this poem ?
how come we can' t discuss these things ourselves ?
where is this relationship going , huh ?
why is marriage and kids so important ?
there' s an overpopulation problem .
whoa .
that came out of left field .
all right .
why is having children the ultimate performance for successful people ?
why ?
well , it doesn' t have to be a performance .
you know , we don' t have to have kids .
we could just , you know , think about it , or not .
could just be ourselves , jet skiing , whatever .
this is not why i hired you .
then why did you hire them ?
well , i have a meeting .
oh .
there it is .
would you like some tea ?
with a little lemon .
so , i' ve never really done anything like this before .
um , where where would we start ?
now .
now .
did you get it ?
yeah .
i did .
i felt it .
it' s hard to describe .
very , very good .
your turn .
now .
not so hard .
sorry .
now .
now .
now .
now !
did you get it ?
yeah , you stop thinking .
yes .
it' s fantastic .
it' s like i' m here , but i' m not
so , i' m not here .
it it' s just
i i i don' t know .
do it one more time .
it' s like i' m a rock or a dish of mold .
i' m whatever else is around .
so i' m free to just exist .
this is the answer .
we just have to be this all day , every day .
that' s the answer .
yes .
do it again .
do it again .
now .
careful , my young students ... you cannot stay in this state all day .
why not ?
yeah , why not ?
it is inevitable that you are drawn back into human drama .
desire , suffering everything that exists in this imperfect world .
shit .
so we get drawn back into human drama ... and how important we think that is .
then we do crazy stuff .
we have to go back to the ball ... so we can get the freedom of being like a like a dish of mold .
yes .
and then back to the drama , the suffering .
it' s kind of a crappy deal .
c' est exactement ca .
an absurd theatrical we must play out , back and forth ... from pure being to human suffering .
but isn' t the drama and suffering less if we do the ball thing every day ?
don' t call it " the ball thing .
call it " pure being .
doesn' t the pure being , ball thing make the day to day suffering easier ?
yeah .
no , it doesn' t .
you' re wrong .
we' re gonna do this every day .
we' il show you .
it' il make it easier .
i' il prove it to you .
human drama is inevitable .
suffering cannot be diminished .
you cannot escape , tommy .
you' il see .
existence is a cruel joke ... that entices in a form of desire .
absurd theater of desire .
i know , buddy , it hurts .
it' s painful .
wait here .
where you goin ' ?
to meditate on desire and suffering .
can i come ?
no .
okay .
i' il see you in a little bit .
we' il do more , um , pure being ?
pain
i hope so .
don' t fucking leave me .
you look ugly . !
no , no , no .
hold up .
no .
no .
no , go back inside .
can i have my car keys ?
you can' t keep coming to work if you dress like that .
me and daryl made some spots marty' s gonna love .
these are the best tops around .
last time , last year , not so good .
but now , this is the truth .
marty' s gonna hate them , dawn .
he' s gonna hate them .
there' s glass between us .
you can' t deal with my infinite nature , can you ?
that is so not true .
wait , what does that even mean ?
we' ve talked about your intimacy problem .
what' s the core of it ?
intimacy is combo of infinites .
i' m definitely gonna have an intimacy problem with you if you keep dressing like that .
well , it' s only been a week .
one day is too much .
the people at the office are freaking out .
you could get free , brad , but you think you have to be superman in control .
and that means you are the source instead of part of the infinite .
and that makes it too hard for us , baby .
stop talking to me like that .
you hired the detectives .
you don' t have to listen to every word they say .
how am i supposed to know which parts to listen to ?
i' il tell you .
no , that' s confusing .
take that off .
take it off .
no .
can i have my car keys , please ?
give me my glasses .
no .
give me my glasses .
you give me my car keys .
no .
yes .
you stay at home .
till you dress normal ... you don' t come to work .
trees and bees

i am so pretty .

shania' s on the stage .
we' ve got the executives here ...
that' s great . working their way back to the , uh , lesser donators .
right .
well , when we did the garth benefit in dallas ...
we put the $1 0, 000 donors up here .
wow , garth .
was that garth garth , or chris garth ?
that' s classic garth .
the best .
classic garth costs .
yeah , so , when we did the garth benefit in dallas , that' s what we
where' s marty ?
where is he ?

i' m doing this for you .
oh , my god .
they' re your detectives , and they gave me this truth .
wow .
nutty .
do you understand ?
there' s glass between us !
don' t look at me like that . !
hey , hey .
hey  there you are , marty .
why don' t you like my spots ?
honey , this look is hurting you , and it' s hurting huckabees .
this is myself .
then you won' t speak at the benefit as yourself .
that is not huckabees .
i am still huckabees .
not in that bonnet .
it' s in my eyes , marty .
it' s like that story of the cave .
what in god' s name is happening to you ?
we trusted you .
we took care of you .
we made you into a national icon .
pulled you out of a mall .
eh , you' ve been given everything by huckabees .
duck a bees !
ooh .
wow , wow , wow .
bradley , there' s board members here .

she said , " duck a bees .
yeah .

i' m in my tree .
i' m talking to the dixie chicks ... and they' re making me feel better .
well , i think the dixie chicks would like you to know that i just got promoted .
what ?
v. p. for public affairs .
i got corporate , dawn .
i' m sorry you had to go through all this .
it' s for the greater good .
i went to the detectives to shake albert out of the coalition .
i admit that .
this doesn' t make sense .
sweetheart , you' re mixing yourself up .
listen , you' re mixing it all up .
wait a second .
huh .
do you even care about the marsh and the woods ?
yes , i care about the marsh and the woods .
albert was not gonna save ' em his way .
you don' t go through the back door with a poem and a bonnet .
you go through the front door with a tie , and you own the marsh and the woods .
that' s how you' re gonna save ' em .
let' s celebrate .
mm hmm .
you want some new clothes ?
yeah .
i' il get you whatever you want .
what do you need ?
i don' t know .
pedicure ?
yeah , but do i have to be pretty all the time ?
well , you know , you have a choice .
but , no , it' s not a choice .
i do have to be pretty .
well , i' m pretty sure the dixie chicks would want you to spread your love ... here where you can at huckabees .
right .
that' s good .
you know what ?
you got albert fired .
stay positive .
bermuda . jet skis .
pina coladas .
all right ?
yeah .
when you leave the office , will you go through the back door ?
okay ?
' cause you don' t look so good today .
okay .
okay .
okay ?
mm hmm .
hey , tom , tom .
go for it , man .
the woods are hopeless .
don' t waste your time .
they will be destroyed .
so will the marsh .
it is a losing game ... mankind has played for more than a century .
sadness is what you are .
do not deny it .
the universe is a lonely place , a painful place .
this is what we can share between us , period .
whoa . !
h' yah !
what are you doing ?
you told me you were done with this stupid method .
why can' t i do it ?
because it is a fantasy .
do you want to lead a fake life ?
you don' t have to get so threatened .
i can mix your thing with their thing .
no , you can' t !
why not ?
because they are completely different .
and theirs is a lie .
dor the last time , forget the tree fantasy .
and as for brad , you must do to him for real ...
what he did to you , and  [ knocking ]
you ditched me .
first my family , and now you guys .
she' s my teacher too , albert .
and she' s still your teacher , tom .
no .
it' s all different now .
i thought we were a platonic trio , not some sick sex dance .
you said that was bullshit .
learn from this , tommy .
painful truth .
i warned you human drama .
is that why you' re doing this , to teach me ?
yeah , is that why you' re doing this , to teach him ?
of course it is .
there are unique moments when two people share the deep sorrow of existence .
all right .
that' s what i wanted to hear .
how can you believe that bullshit ?
t tom tom , i' m sorry .
this just happened .
i' ve never done anything like this before .
we could still be you can still be my other , right ?
shut up , albert .
i brought you here .
i wanted to share la force with you , and you ruined it .
you fell in love .
do not defile it with cliche .
it is unnameable .
yeah ?
well , i reject unnameable !
it leaves me out !
where is your pure being now , tommy ?
i told you .
i' m just gonna accept my loneliness .
and i' m gonna go to an even darker place of nothingness .
drom an even farther , more extreme nothingness on my own !
who needs you guys ?
ahh , sublime .
hey , welcome .
you like my new office ?
let' s start with the method .
let' s start with the method .
we' d like to discuss  we' d like to discuss
okay .
what are you doing ?
okay .
what are you doing ?
what are you doing ?
i' m jokin ' around , guys .
but seriously , i want to quit the process with you .
nothing personal .
i appreciate what you' ve done for me , but i' m over it .
you can' t quit until the case is over .
ah , i can fire you .
no , you can' t .
no , you can' t .
sure i can .
no , you can' t .
paragraph 201 .
neither client nor detective ...
may terminate case prior to resolution as defined by paragraph 31 4 , subclause ' d ' ...
which states " that' s not binding .
oh , it' s binding .
i' il find a lawyer .
oh ?
or maybe even go to the dbl .
how about that ?
go ahead .
oh , i will .
i' m not kidding .
no , brad , this is how it works .
you go to the police .
you you tell them that you went to the existential detectives .
they ask why .
you say , " for personal reasons .
or , maybe you wanted to work the politics at your corporation ...
by rattling albert markovski .
i never told you that .
well , give us a little credit .
the police go to huckabees .
they talk to them .
the board learns that rising star , brad stand ... has weird existential issues .
or he fakes them .
which is odd .
which is worse .
and your girlfriend , the voice of huckabees ...
is dressing like an amish bag lady .
okay , i get it .
you know , brad , suddenly your star isn' t rising anymore .
it' s sinking .
okay .
i said i get it , bernie .
relax .
passive aggressive .
shut up .
aggressive aggressive .
does dawn want to quit ?
dawn' s into this crap for real ... which is the stupidest thing i' ve ever seen in my life .
shall we get back to the case ?
all right .
what you got on me ?
nothin ' .
our staff did a little field work in , uh , cleveland .
what ?
talk to my family ?
mommy and daddy look awesome .
so do you .
but this guy .
wha ah , he doesn' t look too good .
you bastards .
he doesn' t look too good , does he , brad ?
how could you do this ?
ooh .
mm hmm .
are you kidding me ?
he weighs 250 .
he t he talks about geckos all the time .
what' s the point ?
i thought he was a sweet , sensitive young man .
oh , excuse me .
you you spoke to my fat , sad brother ?
yes , brad , on the phone .
indeed , i did , at length .
well , if he' s so sensitive , why doesn' t he lose 7 0 pounds and stop talking about geckos .
maybe he' il find some friends .
well, your brother feels that you' re ashamed ofhim .
are you sympathetic to him ?
are you kidding me ?
i gave him a car .
mm hmm .
i send him shirts .
mm hmm .
i look .
here , guys .
geckos .
and i keep ' em .
i' m a pretty good older brother .
he wishes you would listen to him more .
about what , geckos ?
i i don' t have all the answers .
but maybe he should listen to me more and learn a little .
you have several stories that you like to tell over and over and over .
ohh .
oh ho .
that' s not come on .
that' s a lie .
i i' m not boring like him .
like the mayonnaise story .
the mayo story .
may 1 8 , sales meeting .
shania' s there , you know , promoting her apparel , right ?
it' s 4 : 00 .

why do you think that you tell the mayo story so much ?
i don' t know .
why ?
it' s propaganda .
dor mayonnaise ?
dor you .
specifically , you' re so impressive because you know shania .
and you' re so strong , because you pull one on her .
you' re a funny guy , a good guy .
keeping everyone laughing ... so that maybe , quote , you don' t get depressed .
well , what' s so great about depression ?
nothing .
unless it holds the key ... to something you compulsively avoid ... so it will never be examined or felt ... hence your behavior becomes repetitive like the story .
like the story .
like the story .
like the story .
like the story .
like the story .
shut up .
all right .
i don' t have to tell stories .

you didn' t see me cry .
nobody sees that picture !
nobody sees that picture !
why did you do that ?
no , no , no , no .
we didn' t do this .
we would never do something like this .
never .
oh , maybe sometimes .
we didn' t do this .
never .
who the hell is that lady with the camera ?

we wouldn' t do it like that .

brad , we didn' t do this .
she did it , brad .

that fire was a bitch ass thing to do .
no , it liberated you from the brad .
or did it bond me to brad in the insanity of pain ... until i saw that i' m brad and he' s me ?
yes .
no .
come on .
you guys work together , don' t you ?
we don' t work together at all .
really ?
it' s not like some secret deal ... where she picks up where you leave off , and then we come back to you ?
there is no secret deal .
well , there should be , ' cause that' s the way it works .
you' re too dark , and you' re not dark enough .
you three were close , right ?
maybe too close .
then it went sour and propelled you into one extreme ... and you into another extreme .
so , voila !
two overlapping , fractured philosophies ... were born out of that one pain .
albert !

a dexicorp mall in my grandfather' s forest is not exactly a win .
and they' ve already started surveying to to start construction .
we saved the marsh .
by giving them the woods .

all you did was make huckabees look good .
that' s all you did .
albert , how can you be calm ?

shania doesn' t give a shit !
oh , shania cares .

shania .
brad , do you realize when they destroy the woods
no , let me explain . the average temperature of the marsh rises five degrees ?
the entire food chain is degraded , starting with frogs .
let me explain .
let me explain .
okay , but we saved half the woods .
i' m a vegetarian , brad .

shania , i' m albert .
i used to run the open spaces coalition .
she knew my name .

so what if she knew your name ?
i was only joking , man .

so am i. that' s how i bought into you .
eighteenth floor .
albert , we owe you an apology .
we should' ve stayed with you .
thanks , angela .
see you at the meeting on tuesday .
we' re gonna stop those bulldozers .
oh , my goodness .
i don' t have a job .
i don' t even know who i am .
that' s exactly how i felt .
try this lady .
ah , here he comes !
oh , boy .
the man poet who banged france' s dark lady of philosophy .
the parking lot crusader of truth ... who turned his back on his other like a cold blooded gangsta .
i know .
you hurt my feelings .
i' m sorry .
but you had to do it anyway , didn' t ya ?
she' s a very powerful person .
and i haven' t been with a lot of women .
obviously .
and she used me to teach us about the inevitability of human drama .
so ?
is that where you get off the ride ?
hell no .
i didn' t think so .
looks like you saw some truth .
looks like you saw some truth .
what' d you see ?
well , the interconnection thing is definitely for real .
it is !
i didn' t think it was .
i can' t believe it .
it' s so fantastic !
that' s amazing .
i know .
but it' s also nothing special .
yeah , because it grows from the manure of human trouble .
you see , the detectives , they just wanted to gloss right over that .
but in fact , no manure , no magic .
did you hear some of that ?
some of it sounds pretty good .
i think
i think this case is closed .
is it ever really closed ?
hmm .
what are you doing tomorrow ?
i was thinking about chaining myself to a bulldozer .
do you want to come ?
what time ?
mm , 1 : 00 , 1 : 30 .
sounds good .
should i bring my own chains ?
we always do .
