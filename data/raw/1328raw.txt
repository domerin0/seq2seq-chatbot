unless you are a robber , get out .
knockout ned' s hlstory
robbery !
the first time ...
bring the revolvers ! ... knockout ned saved a dealer from redhead .
we said no killings .
it' s a rule !
we want boss ' money !
open the fund !
do you want to leave ?
we also want it .
the second time , redhead saved knockout
ned learned that rules have exceptions .
an exception .
are you the director ?
robbery !
everybody down !
i don' t play .
whoever moves will be shot !
the third time , the exception became a rule .
with the money from the robberies they would face z .
redhead would protect his busines .
knockout , the best shooter , wanted revenge .
the italian first .
this is 9mm .
it' s not aligned .
you ' il get it at a good price .
this is a 12mm .
we call it ' crap ' .
uzi , 9mm .
from israel .
david' s star .
i want a 30 06 .
it' s party time !
the war begins .
lets pray .
our father , who art in heaven . . . hallowed be thy name . . .
gangsters have the guns but they don' t shoot .
knockout' s one bullet was like ten of z' s bullets .
z couldn' t stand it .
he attacked .
the ghetto was like hell before but now it had become hell !
i decided to go out .
that' s how i became a journalist .
nice picture !
that' s rogerio ris ' for sure .
what was i saying ?
as every professional ...
i started from the lower level , from the bottom .
without knowing what was ahead of me ...
instead if going home i went to the newspaper' s offices .
someone from the city of god worked at the laboratory .
he helped me to fulfil the dream of my life .
rogerio , is the rocket .
photographer .
he is an admirer of yours .
you have a good taste, rocket .
i am leaving .
nice guy !
a personal revenge leaded to war .
the city of god has been divided .
you couldn' t cross it .
not to go to a relative .
those who lived to the ghetto were considered as gangsters .
we were living our own vietnam .
volunteers were giving their lives .
the kids .
somebody hit me .
the war was forgiving everything .
one of z' s guys kicked me .
take this .
he raped my sister ...
z took our home .
kill for your pride .
i am siago , benny' s friend .
you know how to read ?
spell ?
i am good .
you are hired .
to have revenge on my father' s killer .
what' s your name ?
my name is oto .
what' s happening ?
he works .
he needs a gun .
he won' t last a week .
a year later , nobody remembered how it all started .
the aim was , to undertake enemy' s business ... to buy guns and to extend the enterprise .
i sniff , i killed , i stole .
i am man !
the tv showed interest .
the police would intervene .
a gangster from the city of god , was arrested .
manuel massando also known as knockout ned ... is at hospital after an attack of z' s gang .
he gave us an interview .
does the war continue ?
yes , it continues .
were many people killed ?
many .
innocent mostly .
if a person knowns me that' s enough for z to kill him .
are the police absent ?
they hunt me , not him .
i am in jail while he kills people without thinking .
knockout ned believes that the war will continue .
cops promised to dislocate the gangs .
i am the boss and he is in the newspaper !
did you find mine ?
knockout' s only .
my name must be somewhere .
can you read ?
the pictures .

what the hell are you doing ?

somebody signed his conviction .
i would smash his face !
you stole my pictures !
they will kill me !
what are you talking about ?
they' il kill me because of you !
the pictures were at the laboratory .
everything t hat is in the laboratory is for publication .

when a picture is published we pay the photographer .
do you want to become a photographer ?
nice start with a frontpage !
how did you take them ?
i live there .
not even one photographer managed to go to the ghetto .
if you bring more pictures of z ... the newspaper will buy them .
can you ?
i don' t know .
what' s the problem ?
i can' t go there again at night .
and the day ?
it is a risk .
at last they understood that i' m the boss .
what' s the name of this photographer friend of yours ?
he is good .
i' il take to show you .
yes , or not ?
it' s a big chance .
you took the right decision .
i' il give you films , lenses and another camera .
come to see the equipment office .
there is another problem also .
where am i going to sleep tonight ?
i can' t go back .
this one is 135mm .
do you shoot from near or from a distance ?
can you measure the light ?
yes .
don' t you think you are too close ?
i don' t know how i managed to talk to them like this .
maybe i was about to die but i had a camera ... and a chance to become a photographer .
what is more , he had the whole night for us .
do you want to eat something ?
no thanks .
won' t you eat , or drink ?
a joint ?

in which room am i going to sleep ?
unfortunately , i have only one room .
we will sleep together .
i won' t tell you much about my first sexual experience .
somewhere else , another one , a more important erotic scene was taking place .
redhead was helping knockout to escape . without a shot .
the guard was at the hands of the nurse .
meanwhile , z was investing on ammo ...
to terminate redhead .
he was heavily equipped even though he didn' t have to pay .
do you remember the shotgun ?
it is a semi automatic shotgun .
you haven' t seen a brouning like this .
it can even shoot down airplanes .
i want what i asked for .
the american r 15 .

i don' t give a shit .
i' ve got the solution .
