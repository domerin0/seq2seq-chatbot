extreme close up !
ok .
all right .
all right .
here we are in our new surroundings , the abandoned acme doll factory in downtown aurora , illinois .
an official babe lair .
it' il be chick central .
i feel sorry for guys who still live with their parents .
ok .
you' ve probably noticed we' re on early tonight .
usually , at this time on aurora cable , you' re watching plant world .
they didn' t want our 10 : 30 time slot .
but we were able to talk plant world into changing with cooking world .
although they didn' t want to change .
fortunately , white supremacy world was cancelled and the trades worked .
finally , the reason we' re on early is because we' re going to a concert tonight in chicago .
excellent .
yes .
did i mention that we' il be seeing aerosmith ?
until next week , good night and party on .
party on , wayne !

welcome to wayne' s world 2 .
let me bring you up to speed .

there' s a lot to tell you , so let' s take the scenic route .
a year has passed .
i' m a little older and a little wiser .
i' m starting to get hair in really weird places .
i feel like i' m turning into sasquatch .
i still go out with my girlfriend cassandra .
she' s cutting a record demo right now .
her career' s really taking off .
you remember cassandra , don' t you ?
what a babe !
she' d give a dog a bone !
but you know , even though i live on my own now , everybody' s really hassling me to do something with my life .
to become an adult .
i feel like i' m in a john hughes " rites de passage " movie .
but what i' d really like to do is something extraordinary .
something big , something mega , copious , capacious , cajunga .
but i' il probably end up working at great america , mopping up hurl and lung butter .
you remember my best friend garth algar , right ?
i almost forgot .
this year , garth finally got pubes .
you didn' t tell them about my pubes , did you ?
no , of course not .
you are listening to wplg , the pig .
all rock , all the time .
wplg aurora .
handsome dan coming at you on the short side of nine bells at wplg ,
america' s rock authority .
what do you say we check in with mr scream ?
god , handsome dan is so cool .
he must get a million chicks .
i bet he' s totally studly and buffed .
with that voice , he' s gotta be a babe magnet .

but where are we supposed to meet cassandra ?
backstage laminates .

i' m from cicero .
isn' t it cool to be downtown ?
are you those guys with that tv show in aurora ?
wayne' s world ?
wayne' s world !
no !
you guys sure look like ' em .
if wayne says we' re not , we' re not , ok ?
how long does it take to get here from aurora ?
it takes me 40 minutes door to door .
my ma gave me a dollar and dropped me off at the park and ride .
dogs .
dogs .
... and marilyn .
marilyn .
i saw the creature .
i saw the creature ...
who are you ?
i' m jim morrison .
cool .
who' s he ?
a weird naked indian .
cool .
why have you brought me here ?
to help you find some answers , wayne .
answers to what ?
ask me a question .
two trains travelling at 60mph , one from chicago , one from los angeles ...
no .
ask me a question about your life .
what am i supposed to do with my life ?
you should put on a concert in aurora , wayne .
how will i get the bands to come ?
if you book them , they will come .
but i don' t know how to put on a concert .
you must go to england and find a man named del preston , the greatest roadie that ever lived .
he was with us in the good times and the bad .
he' il help you .
any more questions ?
will garth ever get his sports illustrated football phone ?
it was sent to the wrong house .
it will arrive tomorrow with the swimsuit issue and the video ,
the stanley cup 100 years of glory .
how do i get back ?
follow the weird naked indian .
cool .
wake up , wayne !
garth !
i just had the most vivid and powerful dream of my life .
last night , jim morrison spoke to me .
he told me that the purpose of my life was to put on a concert .
guess what finally came in the mail ?
i guess they sent it to the wrong house .
my sports illustrated football phone ...
oh , my god !
cool .
my sports illustrated swimsuit issue ...
oh , my god . ... and the history of the stanley cup 100 years of glory .
garth , it' s a sign !
we will put on a concert .
oh , yes .
we will put on a concert .
this must be the place .
maybe we should' ve called cassandra before we dropped by .
garth , it' s us .
no one' il hassle us .
cassandra needs the encouragement .
excuse me , what are you guys doing here in the street ?
i' m stacking these chickens in the crates .
jim makes sure we have plenty of watermelons .
so you' re selling watermelons ?
no , we just make sure there' s plenty stacked .
just like the chickens .
what do they do ?
they walk past with this glass .
that' s ... weird .
you got to wonder if this is gonna pay off later on .
cool .
it' s ok .
we ought to overdub a track with bobby .
he can wail .
give them a few minutes .
they' re working on it .
the label figures you got three singles on this one .
they want you to come to the coast .
excellent .
not bad for a little girl from hong kong .
what brings you here , wayne ?
i had to tell cassandra something .
yeah ?
yeah .
last night i had a dream .
we' re gonna put on a concert in aurora .
that' s a great idea .
yeah .
it' s a festival .
a festival ?
a festival .
you heard the man .
charming .
what' s it called ?
what' s it called ?
it' s called ...
it' s called ...
it' s called waynestock .
waynestock .
who' s going to be there ?
aerosmith and pearl jam .
who else ?
me and wayne .
and ...
and ...
van halen .
van halen .
who else ?
yeah .
who else ?
an old man fashioning a kayak out of a log ... ?
what ?
no !
rip taylor !
rip taylor' s gonna be there .
rip taylor ?
he' s a god in my country .
he gets mobbed in the street .
great , ' cause he' s gonna be there .
i thought maybe you could play , too .
i would be honoured .
i wouldn' t commit just yet .
you got some real gigs coming up .
real gigs !
real gigs ?
lx nay on the condescension ay there , chet .
bobby , can i ask you a question ?
what is it , garth ?
a sphincter says what ?
i said , a sphincter says what ?
you want me to say " what " , like i don' t get it .
is that it ?
is that it ?
oh , dear .
last guy didn' t get .
you big .
you big .
we small .
we better go .
where are you going ?
england !
i can' t believe paramount is paying to fly us to england .
i thought they' d use doubles .
here we are at piccadilly circus .
what a shitty circus .
good call .
there' s no animals or clowns .
what a rip off .
let' s go to buckingham palace .
does princess di still live here ?
she is such a babe .
did jim morrison give you del preston' s exact address ?
he said exactly london , england .
ok .
i don' t know about this , wayne .
del ?
hello ?
are you del preston ?
i might be .
who are you ?
my name' s wayne campbell .
i' m garth algar .
that' s terribly fascinating , man , but you woke me up .
how can you sleep like that ?
listen , sonny jim , sleeping like this will add 10 years to your life .
i learned it from keith richards when i toured with the stones .
that may be why keith cannot be killed by conventional weapons .
how can i be of assistance ?
you' re gonna think i' m nuts , but ... ... someone visited me in a dream and told me that del preston would help me put on a concert in aurora , illinois .
a concert ?
i' m afraid you' ve been misinformed .
i don' t do that any more .
i' m just an old geezer .
what do i know about music today ?
when i was working , it was all bands like eric clapton and the rolling stones .
it' s not like the grateful dead are still touring , is it ?
actually ...
garth .
look at this scrapbook .
that' s you with led zeppelin .
yeah .
my old lady put that together .
we must' ve toured every concert hall and venue in america , me , my old lady and the road .
is that you and bob dylan ?
yeah .
who' s the old lady ?
that' s my old lady .
it was fun , but those days are gone forever .
but we came from america just to talk to you .
i' m sorry .
i don' t do concerts any more .
come on .
let' s go .
well , i still think you led a really cool life .
it was nice meeting you .
i guess jim was wrong .
hang about .
was it jim morrison ?
yes !
did he have a naked indian ?
yes !
i have to ask you ...
didn' t you think it was a trifle unnecessary to see the crack in the indian' s bottom ?
yes !
absolutely !
i had the same dream .
del , you' il really love aurora .
who' s aurora , anyway ?
frank , this is bobby .
did you get the tape ?
what' d you think ?
definitely .
she sounds great .
yeah , the band is terrible .
it' s a garage band .
they can' t , i' m sure .
i' m working with them .
i' m still in this studio in aurora .
what the hell you doing there ?
she wants to stay here .
why ?
same reason they all want to stay , she' s got a boyfriend .
don' t worry .
i' il get rid of the boyfriend and the band .
i' d like to finish the album in ia .
all right , bobby .
let' s just get it done , ok ?
and there i am in sri lanka , formerly ceylon , at 3am ,
looking for 1, 000 brown m& ms to fill a brandy glass , or ozzy wouldn' t go on stage that night .
jeff beck pops his head round the door and mentions there' s a little sweet shop on the edge of town .
we go , and it' s closed .
there' s me and keith moon and david crosby breaking into this little sweet shop , right ?
instead of a guard dog , they' ve got this bloody great big bengal tiger .
i managed to take out the tiger with a can of mace , but the shop owner and his son , that' s a different story altogether .
i had to beat them to death with their own shoes .
nasty business , really , but sure enough , i got the m& ms , and ozzy went on stage and did a great show .
that was excellent .
to put on a really great rock show ,
like knebworth in england or woodstock , there is only one place you can do it , and that' s here , at adlai stevenson memorial park , in the playing fields .
we better go check it out .
so , wayne ... ?
i hear you' re putting on some kind of concert .
that' s good .
people need to be entertained , need the distraction .
i wish somebody' d do something to block out the voices in my head , the voices that scream over and over ,
why do they come to me to die ?
why do they come to me to die ?
what do we do now ?
here .
let me look at it .
get the flashlight .
ok .
there' s the main gate , and here we are .
no , we' re over here .
i don' t think so .
we turned left at the gate , so that would put us ...
garth !
wait a minute .
i know where we are .
i' m pretty good with maps .
listen .
what ?
turn it off !
i can' t turn it off !
i can' t turn it off !
waynestock ?
you' d purposely invite rock ' n ' roll into our community ?
what' s wrong with a little entertainment ?
entertainment is fine , but this ...
we have lots of big acts that come through here .
ice capades , tiny toons , kenny g ...
kenny g ?
we don' t even get to apply for a permit ?
we would love to put on a rock concert ... not !
betty jo , could we have the permits for a festival , please ?
thank you .
you must fill out the necessary permit applications .
permit applications .
here you go .
thank you , betty jo .
hey , you' re the guy that' s on that wayne world show .
betty jo ?
yeah ?
thank you .
all right .
naturally , you' il need the application for authorisation , approval from the guilds and unions , you' il need some release forms , the decibel level ...
what ?
is something wrong ?
what do you mean ?
it' s my eye , isn' t it ?
why would we want to look at your eye ?
is there something wrong with that weird eye ?
there' s nothing wrong with my eye .
this one just has no pigment .
i' m what you call a partial ocular albino , but i' m fine with it .
i have perfect 20 20 vision with both eyes .
you' re serious about putting on a rock concert ?
are you kidding ?
i' d give my right eye .
you realise there are certain jurisdictions you' il need to follow .
i' d like to think i have an eye for details .
i' m assuming you have the $5, 000 occupancy permit ... ... or you wouldn' t be here .
exsqueeze me ?
baking powder ? $5, 000 occupancy permit ?
yes , we have that , actually .
piece of cake .
fine .
then all applications must be filled out in triplicate and returned at least 10 working days before the event , with the money .
we' il run through these with a fine toothed comb , cross the ts and dot the ...
... lower case js .
i keep falling over .
oh , no .
i' m falling over a lot .
damn these high heels .
cassandra ... ?
why do you go out with me ?
i love being with you .
most guys are jerks .
you' re a good person .
wait .
let me show you what i got at a garage sale .
isn' t that great ?
heard of it ?
exsqueeze me ?
have i ever seen this before ?
everybody has frampton comes alive .
if you lived in the suburbs , you were issued it .
it came in the mail with samples of tide .
look at this old one .
gerry and the pacemakers .
that is old .
i bet those guys actually have pacemakers by now .
can you believe they don' t make vinyl anymore ?
it' s weird , isn' t it ?
that is weird .
bobby said my album won' t be vinyl .
bobby says ...
are you and bobby having an affair ?
no , of course not .
where did you hear that ?
you know how these things start ... one guy tells another guy something , then he tells two friends , and they tell two friends , and they tell their friends , and so on , and so on ...
you know how it goes .
honestly , i' m not having an affair .
i' m nice to him because he' s my producer .
if this deal falls through , i lose my visa and i go back to hong kong .
you have nothing to worry about .
my dad' s coming to visit .
i' d love you to meet him .
treat .
i' m sure he' il just love me .
yeah .
if you' re anything like my old boyfriend .
i' m nothing like him .
then we' re screwed .
i haven' t seen garth in a while .
what' s he up to ?
garth' s doing his laundry .
too bad he doesn' t have a girlfriend to do his laundry .
yeah .
thanks for doing my laundry .
how do you get my clothes so white and fresh smelling ?
it' s an old cantonese method few people know about .
wait a minute .
calgon ?
ancient chinese secret ?
hello .
hi .
i don' t recall ever seeing you in here .
it' s my first time in here .
that' s right .
my mom used to do all my laundry , but i do now .
i' m what you call " sans parents " .
i can go to a movie on a school night , like that .
welcome to the neighbourhood .
would you like some red rope liquorice ?
sure .
what' s your name ?
garth algar .
what' s yours ?
i' m honey ...
horne .
nice to meet you , miss horny .
that' s horne .
it' s french .
ok , miss horne .
garth , would you like to have dinner some night ?
i like to have dinner every night .
no , i mean us .
you and me .
would you like to have dinner ?
a date ?
finally .
it took , like , two hours .
i like ' em teeny and toasty .
so long .
bye .
bye .
maybe we' il see each other around .
yeah .
see you around .
you forgot these .
good night , cassandra .
good work .
thanks .
see you tomorrow .
good night .
i have got to get you to ia .
you are buried here .
i like it here .
all my friends are here .
what time is it ?
10 : 35 .
damn .
i missed the start of wayne' s show .
ok .
we' re in a doll factory , right ?
it reminds me of that movie the leprechaun , with that little guy that goes , " i' m the leprechaun .
garth , i' m the leprechaun !
cool it , ok ?
i' m the leprechaun !
stop it , all right ?
don' t try and steal me pot o ' gold .
why do you like these guys ?
because they' re fun .
if i wanted a guy that was all ambition ,
i could' ve stayed in hong kong .
those guys are 12 for 10 cents .
you mean a dime a dozen .
maybe where you shop .
i think you underestimate them .
they' re really sharp .
stop it , leprechaun man !
garth , chill !
what did those monsters do to you ?
i' m not ...
sweetie .
sweetie .
come on , sweetie .
come on .
pixie dust .
pixie dust .
sweetie , it' s me ...
the leprechaun !
no !
i' m the leprechaun .
yeah .
these guys , really sharp .
i' m scared !
want to leave , but can' t .
want to move .
where you gonna move ?
you gonna move to ireland ?
no !
' cause i' m a leprechaun ...
wayne , we' re here !
here .
let me get the gate for you .
all righty .
come on in .
nice digs , huh ?
cassandra , you look hot .
sorry .
i' d like you to meet my father , mr wong .
please meet you acquaintance , wayne campbell .
very well , if that is your custom .
prepare to die .
i know all seven animal styles the crane .
the stag .
the horse .
the tiger .
the bat .
the rat .
the monkey .
the beetle .
i will take you , old man .
your tongue is quick .
but your sword ?
oh , no .
wayne !
hello ?
can we talk later ?
this is not a good time .
just a moment .
i' ve got call waiting .
hello .
yes ?
can i call you back ?
i am on the other line .
yes , he received a sports illustrated football phone .
wayne , no !
you' ve impressed me .
you' re worthy of my daughter .
we got a party tomorrow at komrades .
it' s kind of a fundraiser for waynestock .
right .
there' il be a $ 10 cover charge .
it' il be a big party .
because it' s at komrades , we' re calling it a communist party .
i remember one time i was in a place like this .
sri lanka .
formerly ceylon .
it was about three in the morning .
i was looking for 1, 000 brown m& ms to fill a brandy glass , or ozzy wouldn' t go on stage that night .
jeff beck pops his head round the door and mentions there' s a little sweet shop on the edge of town .
wayne !
garth !
milton !
how' s it going ?
awesome party !
good tunes , good brew , good buddies .
i feel great , man .
i feel great !
i don' t know , man .
i hate my father .
i hate my life .
but i feel great .
you guys are great .
i' m gonna go pick a fight .
he' s gotten a lot better .
way better .
yeah .
thank you .
i' il be back in a bit .
how' s it going ?
hi .
it' s looking good , campbell .
i' il be at the bar .
good .
i' m so glad you made it .
you look amazing !
i see .
wait .
i have great news .
bobby' s taking me to ia to do the final mix on my album .
isn' t that terrific ?
that' s great .
i' m ecstatic .
i' m beside myself with joy .
hooray for hollywood .
living on your own has its perks .
your mom doesn' t tell you to turn down the stereo .
that' s a real drag .
because moms genetically hate music played at the appropriate level .
and my dad , forget it .
he' d ruin a led zeppelin reunion concert .
he hates music at the correct level .
but the shopkeeper and his son was a different story altogether .
i had to beat them to death with their own shoes .
what' s the deal with bobby ?
wayne ?
it' s getting a little out of hand .
i think you better say something .
good call .
everybody , i' d like to say something !
excuse me .
everybody , can i get your attention ?
i' d like to say something .
keep it down .
we' re really glad you could all make it .
we never knew we had so many friends who believed in this concert idea .
when we first had this idea of putting on this shindig , we didn' t know if anyone would come .
but look ...
you' re all here , pitching in .
i promised myself i wouldn' t cry .
party on !
garth , i' m starting to get a bad feeling , man .
i think something' s going on .
hello .
yes ?
is this aerosmith' s tour manager ?
it is ?
hello .
my name is wayne campbell .
you don' t know me .
i' m not mental or anything .
i' m putting on a concert in aurora , illinois .
yes , i can hold .
del , look .
for years i thought this was a mercedes emblem .
woodstock ?
that was quite a show , man .
you were at woodstock ?
excellent .
what was it like ?
it rained all morning and then it cleared up in the afternoon .
that' s it .
i almost remembered something else , but it' s gone .
you can' t remember what it was ?
still holding .
i want ...
wayne , look what i made .
good work , my friend .
you guys got the permit applications ?
got the money ?
good for you .
most people just take them and never come back .
position 1 to position 2 .
do you copy ?
this is position 2 in position .
position 3 , what' s your position ?
position 3 .
i read you .
position 4 , do you copy ?
over .
4 copies .
back to position 1 .
over .
i' ve to go to ia for a couple of days .
if you need anything ...
i' m at this number .
position 1 to position 2 .
did you see that ?
this is position 2 in position !
sorry , man .
i didn' t see anything .
what is it ?
abort !
we have been identified !
abandon positions !
wayne , let' s run away !
garth , it' s locked !
in here !
the tool box
come on !
let' s go !
do it , miss thing !
do it !
do it !
get it , girl !
get it , girl !
what' s the matter ?
you look like you want to say something to me .
i think we should break up .
what ?
why ?
because there comes a time when people should go their separate ways .
i mean , i' ve got waynestock , you' ve got your career and your producer , and i just think it' s time that we should see other people .
i don' t want to see other people .
what about bobby ?
what about him ?
come on !
do you think i' m a gullibull or even a gullicalf ?
i' ve no idea what you' re talking about .
right !
come on , now !
what about these ?
where did these come from ?
i did a little detective work .
you did spy on me .
yes , i did .
easy .
i think she took that well .
let' s go .
ladies and gentlemen !
your roadie training begins today .
it will not be easy .
you will get tired .
you will get blisters .
you will get aches and pains .
but you will also get good .
are you ready ?
yes , sir !
roadies present and accounted for , sir !
let' s begin .
eye on the task !
come on .
let' s go !
jesus !
it' s crazy !
they' re getting better , del .
look .
get that microphone !
you' re worthless !
you' re less than nothing !
what' s keeping you here ?
you don' t belong here !
why don' t you just quit ?
' cause i got no place else to go !
thanks for coming in with me .
i' m always afraid to come in by myself .
come .
come on .
come on .
sit down .
and i' il fix us a little drink , ok ?
there you are .
an old fashioned .
this coke' s gone bad .
i just love a man with a sense of humour .
you know what i wish ?
what ?
i wish i could climb inside that big brain of yours and just walk around .
really ?
you know what i love ?
what ?
i love the way those big , thick glasses magnify your pupils .
look at me .
i' il bet you like to be in control .
tell me .
when i was 17 , my little sister tried to borrow my def leppard record .
i said , " no way .
that' s just what i' m talking about .
oh , my god .
you' re so limber .

ladies and gentlemen , it takes two people to run a concert .
one backstage and one out front .
two .
one man alone cannot do this .
wayne , you will run the backstage team .
milton , you are the liaison between wayne' s backstage team and garth' s frontstage team , which includes myself in the booth .
to the left and the right of the stage are the machine gun nests , belt fed m 60 brownings .
these babies tend to heat up , so shoot in three second bursts .
in the event of capture ,
i will personally distribute cyanide capsules , to be placed under the tongue like so .
any questions ?
yeah .
i have a question .
when did you turn into a nut bar ?
thank you , mr scream .
i' m gonna be joined by wayne and garth , giving us the low down on the waynestock concert .

now correct me if i' m wrong .
your rainfall varies from 40 inches in the winter to 200 in summer .
and your chief export is modular furniture .
i did a project on sweden in the eighth grade .
i am impressed with your quest for knowledge .
educated men are rare .
i was up all night working on it .
then the next day in gym class ,
i was on the minitramp , and i got diarrhoea .
i really wish i hadn' t told you that .
i am sorry to hear of your illness , but since you' ve sacrificed your health for knowledge of my country , i find you very attractive .
i hope to make love to you in the near future .
ok .
all right .
ok .
all right .
dick van dyke show .

wayne' s world , all right .

everybody' s excited .
it' s gonna be a big concert at adlai stevenson park .
a big party with some great bands .
like aerosmith .
there' s still tickets left .
don' t wait till the last minute .
' cause it' s a chance for the city of aurora ...
to do something ...
fun .
and to put the city on the map .
it' s a lot of work .
work is hard .
you' re not listening , are you ?
i could say anything , like " you' re a complete tool " .
you wouldn' t hear , ' cause you' re a freak with a microphone .
it' s not challenging any more .
it' s like shooting fish in a barrel .
true , sphincter boy ?
what ?
oh .
they' re getting closer .
good information about waynestock .
we' il be back after plg sports .
it' s 16 minutes past the big hour .
right , mr scream ?
great .
good stuff .
i think people are getting cranked .
hi .
bobby , it' s wayne campbell .
wayne .
how' d you get this number ?
it was written on the back of a business card .
i' m looking for cassandra .
i have to talk to her .
it' s really important .
i haven' t seen her .
she said she might come to ia .
she wasn' t definite .
if i hear anything , i' il let you know .
i have to go .
i' m with someone .
i' m sorry i couldn' t help .
ok .
thanks .
bye .
important call ?
some small time promoter .
let' s get some lunch .
what you' re saying is that peter lawford warned kennedy not to mess with the military industrial complex .
yeah .
dig this , man ...
j edgar hoover was one bad cat .
i mean , he had a completely different bag from jack .
he just couldn' t groove .
when two cats can' t groove to the same tune , one of them has to visit the man upstairs .
that' s amazing , man .
excuse me .
wayne , i want you to meet a friend of mine , sammy davis jr .
nice to meet you , mr jr .
nice to meet you , too , man .
i gotta split .
i got some cats i gotta hang with .
bye , sammy .
he' s a good man .
and now , wayne , what can i do you for ?
listen , jim , i' m really confused , ok ?
we haven' t sold any tickets , we have no bands ,
garth is distracted by chicks , i broke up with my girlfriend , and on top of that , del' s gone completely mental .
to complete your journey , you have to help some people along the way .
this next little bit , you' il have to go it alone .
keep the faith , my friend .
if you book them , they will come .
hey , sammy , wait up .
jim , what if nobody shows up ?
sand .
cool .
right .
right , moe .
i understand .
nervous ?
a little .
i' ve never been on the tonight show before .
nothing to worry about .
after the show ...
i have to fly to aurora , to waynestock .
waynestock ?
what' s this waynestock thing ?
nothing .
something she has to do .
hold on a second , moe .
listen , bobby' s put together some great musicians .
you' re making a great album .
together , it can' t miss .
you' re in good hands .
he' s the best .
you listen to bobby and you' il be a big star .
a big star .
moe ?
yeah .
we' re almost out of time , but i' d just like to point out there are still plenty of excellent waynestock tickets still available .
actually , there are about 10, 000 excellent waynestock tickets still available .
and i' d also like to address a rumour .
there' s this rumour that none of the bands have signed and probably no one' s gonna show up .
it' s true that none of the bands have signed .
jim morrison and his weird naked indian friend visited me in the night and assured me that all the bands will come .
that' s all the time we have this week , so until then ...
party on , garth .
party on , wayne .
and we' re clear .
all right !
i don' t know if you should mention that jim morrison thing any more .
yeah .
it' s just that people have started to talk .
they' re saying things like ,
hey , there goes garth and his friend wayne ...
... the psychopath .
it' s embarrassing .
no offence or nothing .
no .
none taken .
i believe this knife is yours .
it' s just that things have started to look a little bleak .
bleak ?
what ?
hey , no guff , chet .
until you pointed that out , it hadn' t occurred to me .
where you going ?
mikita' s .
the usual .
are you coming ?
no .
you guys go and have fun .
i' d probably end up embarrassing you anyways .
no , no .
i' m just gonna to stay here and lick the cat' s butt .
just 15 20 minutes three times a week can really make a difference ...
and all the other products ?
joe , you know the price .
29 . 95 .
that song is from your album .
oh , man .
she looks great .
it should be out next month , or we hope it will be .
who' s we ?
who are you looking at ?
let' s see the guy .
that' s bobby cahn , my producer .
that fine looking man ?
i' m in the wrong business .
i should be a record producer .
then i' d have attractive women smiling at me .
she will be mine again .
oh , yes .
she will be mine again .
you were terrific .
they loved you .
you think so ?
listen to them .
they loved you .
me , too .
i didn' t think i could do it without my band .
your guys were so hot .
damn , i had fun .
good .
let' s celebrate .
did you think about what i said ?
yeah .
i' m still thinking about it .
give me a week ?
ok .
w what' s the matter ?
is anything wrong ?
garth , i' m so scared .
has someone hurt you ?
i' il take care of it .
i' m a grown up now , you know .
it' s ...
it' s my husband .
your what ?
darling .
i meant to tell you , but my divorce isn' t final , and he came over here yesterday , and he was crazy , like an animal .
i wish someone would kill him .
you mean , kill your husband ?
no !
don' t say it .
you mustn' t even think it .
i know you love me , but i won' t let you kill my husband .
although i know you want to .
we both know you want to .
then you could have me any time you want .
and i do mean any time .
get me my cigarettes , would you , lover ?
they' re in my purse .
i' m just so ...
that' s a pretty big gun .
darling , all this talk about killing and . 45 magnums with the clip filed down and the safety off .
it' s just all so confusing ...
i won' t .
i won' t .
i won' t ...
i won' t let you .
he is a dead man .
no way .
you know what ?
i got myself into this , i' il get myself out of it .
i' il take it on the chin and be a man .
keep the faith .
if you book them , they will come .
ok .
all right , man .
you got to stop doing that , all right ?
oh , man .
hello , is anybody here ?
hello .
oh , my god !
rip taylor !
you must be wayne campbell .
yes , i am .

of course i can .
how are you gonna to miss a half naked indian ?
rip taylor , garth algar .
rip , you showed up .

before i could say no , this guy came to me in a dream .
i said , " who are you ? " he said , " jim morrison .
i' m a dead rock star .
i said , " i' m not familiar with your work . " so he played the doors .
i said , " you' re like a crooner in the rock milieu , which i like .
why is our order taking so long ?
he said , " you gotta do waynestock .
i figured , what the hey ?
what' s going on ?
don' t you know ?
we' re here for waynestock .

looking forward to it .
where did they come from ?

i know .
it' s weird .
i don' t know where she is , either .

she said she' d play , and she never misses a gig .
if you see her , send her over to waynestock .
thanks a lot , chief .
all right , bye bye .

people have started to show up , but none of the bands are here .
now , if you' il excuse me , i' m going to hurl .
garth , ix nay on the url hay .

where could cassandra be ?
i think i had too much jolt cola .
jeff , wayne .
i cannot find your daughter and i' m troubled .
alas , my friend , i' ve chosen another for my daughter .
you are an excellent warrior , but i require more in a son in law .
he has money .
name the one you have chosen !
he will die by my hand .
his name is bobby .
he has offered security , a career and a green card .
i arranged the match .
though i am sure this will be useless to you so late in the film , they' il be married at the first presbyterian church .
sorry i could not invite you to the wedding .
it' s ok .
she' s marrying bobby .
what are you doing ?
i' m out !
i have to find cassandra and tell her how i feel .
but i can' t do the concert alone .
it takes two .
you' re right .
i' m in .
but i love her !
i' m freaking out !
what am i gonna do ?
go get cassandra .
del and i will run the concert .
just get cassandra and be back before we start .
go , now !
now move it , people !
go !
go !
go !
hi !
i' m kind of busy now .
i just wanted to know if you needed anything from the permit office .
that' s a unix book .
yeah .
cool .
all right , men .
our work here is done .
excellent .
where' s the first presbyterian church on gordon street ?
gordon street !
oh , yeah .
i once knew a girl who lived on gordon street , but that was a long time ago , when i was young .
do we have to put up with this ?
can' t we get a better actor ?
i know it' s a small part , but we can do better than this .
gordon street ?
oh , yes , gordon street .
i once knew a girl who lived on gordon street .
long time ago , when i was a young man .
not a day passes that i don' t think of her , and the promise i made , which i will always keep .
that one perfect day on gordon street .
that' s , five blocks up , two over .
thank you .
welcome to aurora !
eat me !
not just a place , but a state of mind .
oh , jesus .
god , no .
hi .

son of a bitch !
son of a bitch !
son of a bitch !

stevenson park !
step on it !
one , one , two , two , two .
check two !
check two !
ok .
we have some word that there is some bad red rope liquorice circulating in the crowd .
repeat , stay away from the red rope liquorice .
do not bite any off and chew it .
it could cause a dental emergency .
excuse me .
excuse me .
guys , huh ?
wayne , cassandra , you made it !
this is great !
what' il we do ?
the bands haven' t showed .
jim morrison said , " if you book them , they will come .
it doesn' t look too good .
jim ?
jim !
we really are in the desert .
yeah , no guff !
jim morrison .
told you so , man .
how can i help you ?
none of the bands have shown up .
i know , and they' re not gonna show up .
then why were we supposed to put on a concert ?
because you had to try and do something with your life .
but it was a failure .
whether you won or lost , what' s important is that you gave it your best shot .
sorry , man .
ok .
all right .
you' il think of something .
it' s your movie .
thanks a pantload , chet .
wayne , where are we ?
how do we get back ?
we don' t want to end the movie this way , do we ?
good call .
if we' re gonna go down , let' s at least go down in glory .
let' s do the thelma and louise ending .
yeah !
let' s just keep going , wayne .
ok , garth .
we don' t want to end the movie like this .
yeah .
let' s do the happy ending .
the bands haven' t shown up .
what' il we do ?
what are we going to do , you guys ?
you made it .
excellent !
welcome to waynestock .
all right .
jim , why was i supposed to put on this concert ?
because you had to learn that it doesn' t matter what you do ,
cassandra loves you for who you are .
and that being an adult means facing responsibility , yet still taking the time to have fun .
right .
it' s sort of like coming home on friday night and doing your homework right away , so your saturday night is free to just party .
no , i like the way i said it better .
excuse me .
would you open the gate , please ?
i have to get in there .
you can' t come in .
my girlfriend' s in there .
a lot of people' s girlfriends are in there .
don' t cry .
yeah , we' re gonna clean it up .
ok ?
see ?
see ?
