everything he knows about every evil thing is in here .
i think he wants us to pick up where he left off

it' s the only thing i can think about .

truth or dare ?
truth .
do you want to make out with benji swartz ?
dare .
okay , lame .
you have to ... say " bloody mary " in the bathroom .
is that the best you can come up with ?
who' s bloody mary ?
she' s this witch .
i heard she was a lady killed in a car crash .
it doesn' t matter who she is .
if you say her name three times in the bathroom mirror , she appears ... and scratches your eyes out !
so why would anyone say it ?
because it isn' t real .
no turning on the lights .
and remember , three times .
bloody mary .
this is so stupid .
bloody mary .
bloody mary .
scared you .
you guys are jerks .
lily ?
you mind keeping it down ?
sorry , daddy .
sorry , mr .
shoemaker .
you so like him !
hey , geek .

no !
why sam ?
sam , wake up .
i take it i was having a nightmare ?
yeah , another one .
hey , at least i got some sleep .
hey , you know , sooner or later , we' re gonna talk about this .
are we here ?
yep .
welcome to toledo , ohio .
so , what do you think really happened to this guy ?
so what we' re gonna find out .
let' s go .
hey .
hey .
can i help you ?
yeah , we' re the ... med students .
sorry ?
oh , doctor ...
fliglavitch didn' t tell you ?
we talked to him on the phone .
we' re from ohio state .
he' s supposed to show us the shoemaker corpse .
it' s for our paper .
well , i' m sorry , he' s at lunch .
oh .
well , he said , uh oh , well , you know , it doesn' t matter .
you don' t mind showing us the body , do you ?
sorry , i can' t .
doc will be back in an hour .
you can wait for him , if you want .
an hour ?
we got to be heading back to columbus .
yeah .
look man , this paper' s half our grade ,
so if you don' t mind helping us out ?
look , man
no .
i' m gonna hit him in his face , i swear .
follow me .
dude , i earned that money .
you won it in a poker game .
yeah .
the newspaper said his daughter found him .
she said his eyes were bleeding .
more than that .
they practically liquefied .
any sign of a struggle , maybe somebody did it to him ?
nope .
besides the daughter , he was all alone .
what' s the official causeof death ?
doc' s not sure .
he' s thinking massive stroke , maybe an aneurysm .
something burst up in there , that' s for sure .
what do you mean ?
intense cerebral bleeding .
this guy had more blooding his skull than anyone i' ve ever seen .
but the eyes ?
what would cause something like that ?
capillaries can burst .
see a lot of bloodshot eyes with stroke victims .
yeah , you ever see exploding eyeballs ?
that' s a first for me .
but , hey , i' m not the doctor .
think we could take a look atthat police report ?
you know , for our paper ?
i' m not really supposed to show you
might not be one of ours .
might just be some freak medical thing .
how many times in dad' s long and varied career has it actually been a freak medical thing and not some sign of an awful supernatural death ?
uh , almost never .
exactly .
all right .
let' s go talk to the daughter .
feel like we' re underdressed .
you must be donna, right ?
yeah .
hi , uh ...
we' re really sorry .
thank you .
i' m sam . this is dean .
we worked with your dad .
you did ?
yeah . this whole thing
i mean , a stroke .
i don' t think she really wants to talk about this right now .
it' s okay , i' m okay .
were there ever any symptoms ?
dizziness , migraines ?
no .
that' s because it wasn' t a stroke .
lily , don' t say that .
what ?
i' m sorry , she' s just upset .
no , it happened because of me .
sweetie , it didn' t .
lily , why would you saysomething like that ?
right before he died, i said it .
you said what ?
bloody mary , three times in the bathroom mirror .
she took his eyes , that' s what she does .
that' s not why dad died . this isn' t your fault .
i think your sister' s right, lily .
there' s no way it could have been bloody mary .
your dad didn' t say it, did he ?
no , i don' t think so .
sam : the bloody mary legend dad ever find any evidence that it was a real thing ?
not that i know of .
i mean , everywhere else , all over the country , kids will play bloody mary .
and as far as we know , nobody dies from it .
hey well , maybe everywhere it' s just a story , but here it' s actually happening .
the place where the legend began ?
but according to the legend , the person who says ...
the person who says you know what gets it
but here ...
shoemaker gets it instead, yeah .
right .
never heard anything like that before .
still , the guy did die right in front of the mirror .
and the daughter' s right .
the way the legend goes ,
you know who " scratches your eyes out .
it' s worth checking into .
what are you doingup here ?
we ... we had to go to the bathroom .
who are you ?
like we said downstairs , we worked with donna' s dad .
he was a day trader or something , he worked by himself .
no , i know , i meant ... and those weird questions downstairs , what was that ?
so you tell me what' s going on or i start screaming .
all right , all right .
we think something happened to donna' s dad .
yeah , a stroke .
that' s not the sign of a typical stroke .
we think it might be something else .
like what ?
honestly , we don' t know yet .
but we don' t want it to happen to anyone else .
that' s the truth .
so , if you' re gonna scream , go right ahead .
who are you , cops ?
something like that .
i' il tell you what .
here .
if you think of anything , you or your friends notice anything strange , out of the ordinary , just give us a call .
all right , say bloody mary really is haunting this town .
there' s gonna be some sort of proof a local woman who died nasty .
yeah , but a legend this wide spread , it' s hard .
i mean , there' s like 50 versions of who she actually is .
one story says she' s a witch , another says she' s a mutilated bride .
there' s a lot more .
what are we supposed to be looking for ?
every version' s got thingsin common .
it' s always a woman named mary , and she always dies in front of a mirror .
so we' ve got to search local newspapers public records as far back as they go , see if we can find a mary who fits the bill .
well , that sounds annoying .
no , it won' t be so bad , as long as we ...
i take it back .
this will be very annoying .
i' m not sure .
they were cops or detectives or something .
whoever they were , they were cute .
jill .
you didn' t think so ?
yeah , okay, they were cute .
but , still, do you think something could have happenedto donna' s dad ?
maybe lily was right .
maybe bloody mary got him .
very funny .
wait , i' m sorry .
was that fear i hear in your voice ?
no .
charlie ...
i' m walking to the bathroom mirror right now .
jill , quit it .
oh , no ,
i can' t help myself .
i' m gonna say it .
bloody mary .
bloody mary .
bloody mary .
jill ?
jill !
you' re such a freak .
i' il call you tomorrow .
you did it .
you killed that boy .
why sam ?
why' d you let me fall asleep ?
' cause i' m an awesome brother .
so , what did you dream about ?
lollipops and candy canes .
yeah , sure .
you find anything ?
oh , besides a whole new level of frustration ?
no .
i' ve looked at everything .
a few local women , a laura and a catherine , committed suicide in front of a mirror , and a giant mirror fell on a guy named dave .
but , uh ...
no mary .
maybe we just haven' t found it yet .
i' ve also been searching for strange deaths , in the area , you know , eyeball bleeding , that sort of thing .
there' s nothing .
whatever' s happening here , maybe it just ain' t mary .
hello ?
and they found her on the bathroom floor .
and her her eyes ... they were gone .
i' m sorry .
and she said it .
i heard her say it .
but it couldn' t be because of that .
i' m insane , right ?
no , you' re not insane .
god , that makes me feel so much worse .
look ...
we think something' s happening here , something that can' t be explained .
and we' re gonna stop it , but we could use your help .
what did you tell jill' s mom ?
i just said i needed some time alone with jill' s pictures and things .
great .
i hate lying to her .
this is for the greater good .
hit the lights .
what are you guys looking for ?
we' il let you know as soon as we find it .
hey , night vision .
thanks .
perfect .
do i look like paris hilton ?
so , i don' t get it .
i mean , the first victim didn' t summon mary , and the second victim did .
how' s she choosing them ?
beats me .
i want to know why jill said it in the first place .
it' s just a joke .
somebody' s gonna say it again .
it' s just a matter of time .
hey .
there' s a black light in the trunk , right ?
gary bryman ?
you know who that is ?
no .
so , gary bryman was an 8 year old boy .
two years ago , he was killed in a hit and run .
the car was described as a black toyota camry , but nobody got the plates or saw the driver .
oh , my god .
what ?
jill drove that car .
we need to get back to your friend donna' s house .
linda shoemaker .
why are you asking me this ?
look , we' re sorry , but it' s important .
yeah .
linda' s my mom , okay ?
and she overdosed on sleeping pills .
it was an accident , and that' s it .
i think you should leave .
donna , just listen get out of my house !
oh , my god .
do you really think her dad could have killed her mom ?
maybe .
i think i should stick around .
all right .
whatever you do , don' t ...
believe me , i won' t say it .
wait , wait , wait .
you' re doing a nationwide search ?
yep .
the nclc , the fbi database any mary in the country who died in front of a mirror is good enough for me .
but if she' s haunting the town , she should have died in the town .
i' m telling you .
there' s nothing local .
i check .
so , unless you' ve gota better idea .
why mary' s choosing a victim ?
it seems like there' s a pattern .
i know i was thinking the same thing .
with mr .
shoemaker and jill' s hit and run both had secrets where people died .
right .
there' s a lot of folklore about mirrors that they reveal or your lies , or your secrets , that they' re a true reflection of your soul , which is why it' s bad luck to break them .
right .
right .
yeah , so maybe if you' ve got a secret ,
i mean , like a really nasty one where someone died , then mary sees it and punishes you for it .
whether you summoned her or not .
take a look at this .
looks like the same handprint .
her name was mary worthington an unsolved murder in fort wayne , indiana .
i was on the job for 35 years , detective for most of that .
now , everybody packs it in with a few loose ends , but the mary worthington murder ... that one still gets me .
what exactly happened ?
you boys said you were reporters .
we know mary was 19 ,
lived by herself .
we know she won a few beauty contests , dreamt of getting out of indiana , being an actress .
and we know , the night of march 29th , someone broke into her apartment and murdered her , cut out her eyeswith a knife .
that' s right .
see , sir , when we ask you what happened , we want to know what you think happened .
technically , i' m not supposed to have a copy of this .
now , see that there ,
t r e " ?
yeah .
i think mary was trying to spell out the name of her killer .
you know who it was ?
not for sure .
but there was a local man , a surgeon ,
trevor sampson .
and i think he cut her up good .
now , why would he do something like that ?
her diary mentioned a man she was seeing .
she called him by his initial , " t.
well , her last entry , she was gonna tell to his wife about their affair .
but how do you know it was sampson who killed her ?
it' s hard to say .
but the way her eyes were cut out , it was almost professional .
but you could never prove it ?
no .
no prints , no witnesses .
he was meticulous .
is he still alive ?
nope .
if you ask me ,
mary spent her last living moments trying to expose this guy' s secret .
but she never could .
where' s she buried ?
she wasn' t .
she was cremated .
what about that mirror ?
it' s not in evidence lockup somewhere , is it ?
no .
it was returned to mary' s family a long time ago .
you have the names of her family by any chance ?
i mean , you bring these strangers into my house , and they ask me things like that ?
they were only trying to help .
please , donna , you have to believe me .
what ?
about bloody mary ?
please , i know it sounds crazy .
crazy " doesn' t even begin to cover it .
i mean , it' s one thing for my sister to believe this crap .
she' s 12 .
but you ?
think about the way your dad died , okay , and the way jill died .
okay , so ...
bloody mary .
no !
bloody mary .
bloody mary .
see ?
nothing happened .
why would you do that ?
oh , my god , there really is something wrong with you .
elements that lose electrons become positive ions , which are smaller than other atoms of the same element .
therefore , the ionic radius is smaller than the atomic radius
charlie !
charlie !
charlie , stop it !
what' s wrong ?
just calm down !
charlie !
aah !
let me go !
charlie !
oh , really ?
ah , that' s too bad , mr. worthington .
i would have paid a lot for that mirror .
okay , well , maybe next time .
all right , thanks .
so ?
so , that was mary' s brother .
the mirror was in the family for years , until he sold it one week ago to a store called estate antiques , a store in toledo .
so wherever the mirror goes , that' s where mary goes ?
her spirit' s definitely tied up with it somehow .
isn' t there an old superstition that says mirrors can capture spirits ?
yeah , there is .
when someone would die in a house , people would cover up the mirrors so the ghost wouldn' t get trapped .
this mary dies in front of the mirror , and it draws in her spirit .
yeah , but how could she move through 100 different mirrors ?
i don' t know but if the mirror is the source ,
i say we find it and smash it .
yeah , i don' t know .
maybe .
hello ?
charlie ?
hey .
hey .
it' s okay .
you can open up your eyes , charlie .
it' s okay , all right ?
now , listen .
you' re gonna stay right here on this bed .
you' re not gonna look at glass or anything else that has a reflection , okay ? as long as you do that she cannot get you .
but i can' t keep that up forever .
i' m gonna die , aren' t i ?
no .
no .
not anytime soon .
all right , charlie , we need to know what happened .
we were in the bathroom .
donna said it .
that' s not what we' re talking about .
something happened , didn' t it , in your life .
a secret ... where someone got hurt ?
can you tell us about it ?
i had this boyfriend .
i loved him .
but he kind of scared me , too , you know ?
and ... one night at his house , we got in this fight .
then i broke up with him , and he got upset and he said he needed me and he loved me .
and he said ... " charlie , if you walk out that door right now , i' m gonna kill myself .
and you know what i said ?
i said , " go ahead .
and i left .
how could i say that ?
how could i leave him like that ?
i just ...
i didn' t believe him , you know ?
i should have .
her boyfriend killing himself , that' s not really charlie' s fault .
you know as well as i do , spirits don' t exactly see shades of gray ,
dean .
charlie had a secret , someone died .
that' s good enough for mary .
i guess .
you know, i' ve been thinking , it might not be enough to just smash that mirror .
why , what do you mean ?
mary' s hard to pin down , right ?
and she moves around from mirror to mirror .
so , who' s to say that she' s not gonna just keep hiding in them forever ?
so maybe ... we should try to pin her down , you know , summon her to her mirror and then smash it .
well , how do you know that' s gonna work ?
i don' t ,
i' m not for sure .
well , who' s gonnasummon her ?
i will .
she' il come after me .
all right , you know what ?
that' s it .
this is about jessica , isn' t it ?
you think that' s your dirty little secret , that you killed her somehow ?
sam , this has got to stop , man .
i mean , the nightmares and and calling her name out in the middle of the night , it' s gonna kill you .
now , listen to me .
it wasn' t your fault .
if you want to blame something , then blame the thing that killed her .
or , hell , why don' t you take a swing at me ?
i' m the one that dragged you away from her the first place .
i don' t blame you .
you shouldn' t blame yourself , because there' s nothingyou could' ve done .
i could' ve warned her .
about what ? !
you didn' t know what was gonna happen .
and , besides , all of this isn' t a secret .
i mean , i know all about it .
it' s not gonna work with mary anyway .
no , you don' t .
i don' t what ?
you don' t know all about it .
i haven' t told you everything .
what are you talking about ?
it wouldn' t really be a secret if i told you , would it ?
no .
i don' t like it .
it' s not gonna happen .
forget it .
dean , that girl back there is going to die unless we do something about it .
and you know what ?
who knows how many more people are gonna die after that ?
now , we' re doing this .
you' ve got to let me do this .
well , that' s just great .
all right , let' s start looking .
maybe they' ve already sold it .
i don' t think so .
that' s it .
you sure about this ?
bloody mary .
bloody mary .
bloody mary .
i' il go check that out .
stay here .
be careful .
smash anything that moves .
crap .
hold on
whoa , guys , false alarm .
i tripped the system .
who are you ?
i' m the boss' s kid .
you' re mr. yamashiro' s kid ?
come on .
come into this one .
it' s your fault .
you killed her .
you killed jessica .
like i said , i was adopted .
yeah .
you know , i just
i really don' t have timefor this right now .
you never told her the truth , who you really were .
but it' s more than that, isn' t it ?
those nightmares you' ve been having of jessica dying , screaming , burning you had them for days before she died .
didn' t you ? !
you were so desperateto ignore them , to believethey were just dreams .
how could you ignore them like that ?
how could you leave her alone to die ?
you dreamt it would happen !
dude .
sammy , sammy !
it' s sam .
god , are you okay ?
uh , yeah .
come on , come on .
you killed them !
all those people !
you killed them !
hey , sam ?
yeah ?
that' s got to be like what , 600 years of bad luck ?
so this is really over ?
yeah , it' s over .
thank you .
charlie ?
your boyfriend' s death , you really should try to forgive yourself .
no matter what you did , you probably couldn' t have stopped it .
sometimes bad things just happen .
that' s good advice .
hey , sam ?
yeah ?
now that this is all over ,
i want you to tell me what that secret is .
look ...
you' re my brother .
and i' d die for you .
but there are some things i need to keep to myself .
