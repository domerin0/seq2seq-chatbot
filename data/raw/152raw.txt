sheikh salameh was our target .
he ran a large terrorist faction that had taken out a number of american targets , including at least one of the embassy bombings ... that left 212 people dead mostly civilians .
an assassination was not an option .
he needed to appear to die of natural causes , to avoid violent repercussions , and even more bloodshed his base of operations was cyprus .
what we knew about him was that he was extremely dangerous , extremely paranoid , and he was planning a trip to beirut to see the family doctor .
i sent bishop in a couple of months ahead of me , to make contacts and get within striking distance of the sheikh .
i set him up at the commodore .
where all the flacks and the expatriates stayed .
his cover was as a photo journalist .
he was good .
he was talented .
he had a good eye .
probably had a photographymerit badge stuffed in a drawer at home .
it wasn' t that much different from ' nam , actually , so it wasn' t long ...
before he was right at home .
took him seven weeks ... but bishop found a way toget to the sheikh .
hi .
hi .
yeah , uh , tobacco , see , cigarettes
it' s for the children , for god' s sake .
fine .
okay , calm down .
calm down !
bishop delivered medical supplies ... to the refugee camp .
he' d negotiated a deal with a new contact in order to get closer to the sheikh' s doctor .
take the antibiotics and the morphine ... straight to the doctor ; , the rest of the stuff , the hypos , the bandages
oh , fuck .
hey , what happened to the kid over here ?
oh , he was trying to take the hill .
it' s in the north end of the camp .
if they make it , they' re clear into a safe zone where they can get medical supplies and food .
of course , they' ve got to make it back .
there we go , honey .
hi .
hi .
i' d like to come back and do a story on the doc .
maybe get something published for you .
for me ?
yeah , let the world know what' s goin ' on here .
well , i don' t know , terry .
maybe we can work something out .
anyway , bishop did a " day in the life " spread on the doctor ... that we got printed in the times .
so , with that relationship intact , things looked good .
it' s good .
then again , this was beirut .
we didn' t know when the doctor was going to be giving the sheikh his physical , but it was our only opportunityto take him out .
so , i didn' t have the usual time to butter him up , which means we needed twice the sex with half the foreplay .
hello ?
muir has arrived .
huh ?
can you get over here soon ?
right .
okay .
good .
all right .
what' s wrong ?
uh , israeli troops .
movin ' into the bekaa valley .
mm .
where in the bekaa ?
south end .
god , it' s 5 : 30 .
with the roadblocks , you won' t get there till noon .
yeah , so the shots won' t be so pretty .
all right , i' m up .
what' s so important ?
hey , it' s a new day .
far too early , you psycho .
what is it ?
the sheikh ali salemeh , he' s moving .
how ?
speedboat from cyprus .
he' s booked the top floor of the nebaa apartments for two weeks .
my god , you' re hideous .
why do you even bother ?
missed you , too .
what do you want ?
flowers at 5 : 00 in the morning ?
flowers would be nice .
but i' il settle for breakfast .
well , i got a good spot .
yeah ?
yeah , taught the guy to make migas .
yeah .
migas ?
mexican restaurant in beirut , huh ?
i' m impressed .
suddenly , mexican doesn' t sound so good to me .
this better be the best damn breakfast i ever had .
it' s delicious .
you' il love it .
we have to make it to the end of the alley .
you' re gonna make a beautiful corpse .
happy birthday , nathan .
you know langley has seven different birth dates for you ?
well , they' re all wrong .
i know .
it wasn' t easy .
k. g. b. , mossad , also wrong .
fortunately , i was well trained .
tom , i' m speechless .
where the hell did you find something like this in beirut ?
beirut ?
diplomatic pouch , overnight from london .
got a new racket goin ' on here .
operation dinner out .
dinner out ?
mm .
dinner out .
i' il remember that .
here we go .
how' re we doing ?
the sheikh' s scheduled for a physical .
i made contact with his doctor , who is also his cousin .
that sounds right .
doctor' s name is ahmad , works at a refugee camp ...
south of town .
i got to him through an aid worker .
blonde or brunette ?
i didn' t say it was a she .
is she cute ?
just someone i used to get to the camp .
is she gonna be any further use to us ?
not to us .
another piece of nasty business .
langley wants a backup .
okay ?
they want me to liaise with the lebanese militia , just in case .
nathan , those guys are cowboys .
no .
not an option .
all the more reason to make sure we do it our way .
you' re ten minutes late .
nathan , we' re okay .
i just got hung up .
look , we got zero room for error here .
you' re right .
you' re right .
it won' t happen again .
ahmad .
good to see you .
oh , how are you , sir ?
i' m great .
listen , i have a friend i think you' d be interested in speaking with .
you good on time ?
okay .
yes , okay .
hello , doctor .
fine .
may i ?
how are you , sir .
please .
it' s official business .
i' m afraid a bit unpleasant , but something you ought to see .
the doctor' s father had been a politician , a diplomat of some note . and he and his wife had died a couple of years back , from co2 asphyxiation .
we have reason to believe that the death of your parents was not accidental .
are you saying ... they were murdered ?
we know who did it .
i wanted to give you a chance , if you want it , to do something about this .
something i think would serve both of our interests .
i' m sorry .
it' s like he wanted me to know .
what i did know was that if we weren' t careful , she was going to cause the whole thing to come crashing down around us .
okay .
yeah .
good .
he' s been with her every night .
yeah .
scotch .
wh what' s wrong ?
nothin ' .
excuse me , sir ?
mm .
see the gentleman at the bar ?
would you get him a double of your cheapest scotch ?
okay ?
thank you .
who is it ?
it' s this guy , he , uh , he works at the embassy .
he helped me out with a passport problem .
monsieur , the gentleman here bought you a scotch .
good guy .
a really good guy .
terry .
it' s terry , right ?
that' s right .
it' s good to see you again , nathan .
i was just saying how you helped me out with that passport problem .
uh , elizabeth hadley , nathan muir .
pleased to meet you .
nice to meet you .
what you don' t know is that he mentioned you at the embassy .
said he met a beautiful girl and he wanted to extend his stay now that' s that' s gotta be you , right ?
well , you never know .
you want to join us ?
ah well , maybe , just for a minute .
i don' t want to be a third wheel .
so , what brings you to this part of the world ?
well , i' m with an international aid organization .
oh .
how do you keep track of it all ?
it all " ?
i haven' t been here that long , but it seems like nobody trusts anybody .
seventeen sects , all claiming their birthright here .
do you have a favorite ?
our organization' s neutral .
god , that must be nice , being neutral .
never having to take sides .
sleeping like a baby .
that' s a simplistic way  please , don' t defend me .
what ?
no , no , she' s right .
how do you sleep , elizabeth ?
hey .
well , actually , i don' t .
it' s the shelling i can' t quite get used to , you know ?
all night .
well , it' s more effective that way .
families at home .
greater chance for casualties .
and quite a lot of these shells , they seem to come from warships .
funny , too , now that i think about it .
the bombs , the guns , the bullets , the tanks , they all come from somewhere else , too uh , china , syria ,
iraq , iran the u. s.
this place is like " 31 flavors " something for everyone .
bad day at the office , nathan ?
ah , sh you' re right .
i apologize . jesus , here you are , kind enough to invite me to your table , and i start talking politics right off the bat .
mm .
i guess that' s the curse of the job .
must be .
so , elizabeth , do you miss london ?
it must be tough not to be able to return .
why should that concern you ?
what are you talking about ?
i don' t know if she' s mentioned , but she' s not welcome at home .
parents won' t talk to her , her brother and two sisters think she' s crazy .
she' s a fanatic .
stop it .
this is ridiculous .
yeah , you just met this guy , right ?
no , please don' t .
please , stay with your friend .
what the fuck are you doing ?
exactly what you should have done your homework .
nathan , she set us up with ahmad .
she' s just an asset , huh ?
did it ever occur to you she might see you as an asset ?
yes , it did , and i' m tellin ' you , you' re wrong .
how' d you two meet ?
did you mark her ?
or was it the other way around ?
did she get you to do you any favors ?
you' re out of line .
drop it .
it' s under control .
oh !
how about him ?
rajiq nabih .
you got him under control ?
hezbollah .
she uses him to finance her camp , and he uses her for god knows what .
tell me i' m wrong , tom .
tell me you knew about him .
i don' t know what the fuck you' re doin ' .
but my personal life is my business .
you stay out of it .
oh , like heck .
sure " terry .
i' il stay out of your personal life .
excusez moi .
uh , taxi .
taxi , s' il vous plait .
oui , madame .
am i getting played here ?
huh ?
jesus christ , you' re such a  am i getting played ?
oh , you' re accusing me of lying to you ?
what is it ?
do you want the truth ?
well , uh , fine .
i' m a fixer .
uh , fanatic .
how do you think i move so freely ?
you know , i make deals .
provide introductions .
anything to try and help ... the people that i work with .
as much as i' d like to deny it , most times , those introductions have consequences .
why can' t you go home ?
why can' t you go home ?
why ?
i put
why ?
i was involved with , um , a , human rights group in london .
we bombed a building owned by the chinese government .
it was supposed to be empty , and it wasn' t .
and i have to live with that .
fine .
well , that' s me .
what about you ?
y you can start small there .
your name .
you know my name .
your name .
terry .
tell me your real name , please .
terry .
jesus , you' re pathetic .
she had worked both ends against the middle for so long ,
the middle decided to give up and go home .
the chinese , of course , had serious problems with her .
a lot of little ones .
one big one .
the london bombings claimed the life of the premier' s nephew , and they don' t tend to forget that kind of thing .
how well did you know hadley ?
our paths crossed .
that' s about it .
what was bishop' s reaction to all this ?
didn' t bring it up .
so , neither did i.
i' m gonna try to get us some work in south america .
ever been to argentina ?
you okay ?
yes .
i am okay .
fuck .
okay .
halfa drop of this on the skin ... and he' il be dead within 12 hours .
you will use this stethoscope .
you will take the cap off , hold it to his chest to check his heart , and place the cap back on don' t brush up against it .
got it ?
yeah .
that' s it .
tell me is it hard ?
is what hard ?
to take a life .
yeah .
the sheikh wants me to come at noon .
on friday .
which was just four long days away .
lntelligence showed us he was in the process ... of planning a major attack on the civilian sector of west beirut .
we were on the clock , and we knew this was ouronly chance .
so it was imperative that everything went according to plan .
so bishop baby sat the doctor , and the rest of us tried not to watch the water boil .
and to satisfy langley , i met with the lebanese militia , who were more than just a little excited about even the possibility ... of putting their bomb squad into action against the sheikh , in case the plan with the doctor failed .
monsieur .
bonjour .
the militia was purely a backup .
not a real option .
and then there was the waiting .
that' s the worst part .
gives you too much time to consider , " what if ?
my name' s tom .
and then , on ...
thursday , the day before the sheikh ' s physical , the druze and the party of god started a street war in south beirut .
she got antsy , and the water boiled over .
tom bishop on the phone .
yeah ?
the sheikh wants them there within the hour .
so here we go .
nathan , the doc' s not with me .
where the hell is he ?
the amal retaliated and shelled the camp .
you let him go ?
nathan
you let her take him ?
on my way .
lebanese militia is not an option .
we let the sheikh get away , we are dead in the water .
no .
i can get him there .
just trust me .
get out of the way !
move !
ahmad , it' s time .
i' m sorry .
we gotta go now .
fuck !
move !
hello ?
it' s muir .
where are we ?
looks like they' re packing up to go .
move !
move !
and ?
could be an hour .
could be ten minutes .
get out of the way !
come on !
move !
move !
move !
move !
get out ofthe fucking way !
hello ?
okay .
okay .
good luck , ahmad .
ahmad , we gotta go .
you okay ?
yes .
yes .
yes .
you okay ?
okay .
thank you .
come on , ahmad .
come on .
the destruction was a little more extensive ... than anyone anticipated .
our lebanese friends were a little insecure about this being their first big mission , so they packed up the car with enough semtex to blowup half of beirut .
it was a tough deal , but i figured bishop could handle it .
i didn' t see him again until a week later , when we were scheduled to fly out of there for karachi .
that was the last time i saw him .
happy ?
seventy four casualties , an apartment block leveled , one dead terrorist
yeah , happy .
we have some fucked up barometer for success , don' t we ?
let' s take a walk .
i' m not going with you .
hooked up with another op .
probably for the best .
is this about her ?
no .
be sure you' re doing it for the right reasons , tom .
yeah .
i' m done with your reasons , nathan .
i' m done with you .
i' m not ending up like you .
good luck .
good luck .
lizzy ?
yes ?
i' m on my way .
i' ve got to go brief the white house .
we' il finish this up at 07 00 tomorrow .
the files you requested , sir .
ah , thank you .
wait !
you can' t go in there .
i' il get back to you .
it' s all right .
you can' t do this .
i' m due at the white house .
he' s one of ours .
troy , do you remember when we could tell the good guys from the bad guys ?
all this ... it was about something , wasn' t it ?
yes .
yeah , yeah , yeah .
oh , forgot my smokes .
i' il get them , sir .
you' re aware this is now a non smoking facility , sir ?
feels good to break a rule now and then .
good morning .
thomas quinn .
mitch alford , please .
nathan muir .
one moment , please .
mitch , i got nathan muir on the line .
want to take it ?
thanks .
hey , nathan .
what can i do for you ?
who' s this ?
she was his wife .
this guy and his fucking wives .
she stayed in korea while he did two tours in south america .
the second op with harry duncan was real sensitive shit .
muir worked with duncan ?
this should work for both of them .
liquidate everything , mitch .
stocks , t bills money markets , the works .
shouldn' t we discuss this ?
no .
i don' t care about the penalties .
i want to have access to it now .
nathan , save for a rainy day .
look , i know what i' m doing .
1 7 1 2 4 4 8 2 9 2 ;
first maritime of grand cayman .
grand cayman ?
that' s it .
thanks , mitch .
this is harker , i need to find out if there were any calls ... made to hong kong since this morning .
the whole building .
hi .
hi there .
mislaid my pass .
i' il take a look upstairs .
no problem .
get a load of this .
what ?
he consolidated his international trading account .
he what ?
sent them to a bank in grand cayman .
get me his account balance .
right .
yeah ?
harry , it' s muir .
here' s a list of the hong kong calls you requested .
embassy .
that' s his cell phone .
hong kong herald .
that' s andrew unger' s fucking office .
you still have contact with that official at the power company ?
yeah .
yeah , deng .
why ?
yeah , this is harker .
i' il hold .
where can i fax you this under the radar ?
kowloon marriott .
what the hell is going on here , muir ?
you gotta trust me on this , harry .
why should i trust you ?
jesus , you recommended boy scout to me in the first place .
call me on my cell .
muir ?
what' s going on , unger ?
i' m looking for my badge .
i don' t understand it
where' smuir ?
looks like he' s gone for the day , sir .
what ?
how much longer ?
print them out and send them up .
yeah ?
what now ?
did you get my fax ?
yes .
i see an op requiring three months of prep .
bishop prepped it before he piggybacked sideshow .
so , what , we' re going to ask him for help ?
he' s going to be dead in six hours .
no , he' s got a friend on the inside .
check the roster for sideshow .
well , i' il be damned .
tran .
he' s got all the schematics for the prison .
what do we need deng for ?
thirty minutes ofcomplete blackout at su chou .
and harry ?
yeah ?
give me bottom dollar .
yeah ?
deng wants 500, 000 yuan for the power out at su chou .
no way .
tell him a hundred " k " , and i' il pay in dollars .
well , he won' t risk it for less than 300 , but he will take dollars .
five years ago , it would have cost 20 grand .
five years ago , deng would not have had to bribe ... ten employees , two supervisors , a local politician all of whom stand to lose their lives if they get caught .
come on , muir .
it' s not like it was your money .
tell ' im 282 grand in the grand cayman account and that' s it .
okay .
it' s a done deal .
morning , gladys .
oh , if the wife calls , tell her i' il be upstairs .
good morning , gentlemen .
director wilson .
good morning .
have a seat .
i , uh , found some extra stuff on bishop .
i don' t think it' s relevant , but if you want to see it
harker , you want to go ahead ?
there are a couple of things that need to be cleared up .
about bishop ?
no , about you , muir .
about the past 24 hours .
mr. muir has been working against us from the start .
what are you talking about ?
i' ve done nothing but cooperate .
cooperate ?
have i withheld anything ?
certainly the fact that harry duncan tipped you off ... to bishop' s situation before you even arrived here yesterday .
yet you chose to play dumb with us .
why ?
okay .
then maybe you' d like to tell us about the calls you placed ... to duncan from andrew unger' s office last night .
harry duncan' s a friend  aren' t they all .
we were discussing a personal matter .
harry duncan' s gone missing .
oh , yeah ?
well , good for harry .
he deserves some time away .
with your $282, 000 ?
muir transferred that amount to a grand cayman account yesterday .
as of an hour ago , it' s gone .
you want to accuse me of something ?
accuse me .
maybe the payoff went to ...
digby gibson when you tipped off the press .
troy ?
leave digger out of this .
his paper' s a front .
he' s ml 6' s man in hong kong .
anything else , harker ?
yes , sir .
yesterday , imagery analysis delivered a file ... requested by muir' s secretary to your office .
did you receive that file , sir ?
i don' t remember seeing it .
it was returned at 03 00 this morning .
all right , give it to me .
thank you .
is this china ?
muir ?
i believe it is , sir , and i think it would behoove mr. muir ... to tell us exactly what $282, 000 has bought him there .
muir ?
it' s kind of difficult to explain .
i think you better tell us everything .
i' ve been using company resources for personal benefit .
for the past year , i' ve been routing one of our satellites ... over some retirement property that i' m thinking about buying .
what the hell is that ?
harker , let me see that .
because of the changing weather patterns and the erosion ... that' s occurring along the coastline of the beaches , and the fact that it' s my life savings ,
i just wanted to be sure .
sorry .
i believe i' il sit in for the rest of this .
aiken , where did you leave off yesterday ?
beirut , sir .
we still don' t know how hadley wound up in a chinese prison .
should we go off the record with this , sir ?
no .
let' s get on with this .
after the bombing , hadley was a concern .
not only to middle east ops but to bishop ' s life .
so i brokered a trade with the chinese government , using hadley in exchange for a u. s. diplomat convicted of espionage .
and she was flown to a high security prison near su chou , eastern china .
the place was cleared out and a " dear john " saying they were through ... was forged and left for bishop to find .
it appears you underestimated bishop' s feelings for her .
yeah , i underestimated it .
and you took it upon yourself to do this deal ... and you were alone in this .
yeah .
just me .
muir' s secretary is on the phone .
your secretary' s on the phone , line one .
yeah ?
i' ve got commander wiley .
okay , connect us .
commander wiley , sir .
fax received .
what' s the verdict ?
we' re on for tonight .
roger , sir .
understand .
operation dinner out is a go .
confirm ?
correct .
dinner out is a go .
dinner out' s a go ?
helluva way to speak to your wife .
why do you think they keep dumping him ?
how did bishop find out where she was ?
couldn' t have been too hard .
small world , people talk .
a white face in a chinese prison stands out .
he' s well trained .
should' ve known he' d find out .
any other questions ?
yeah , one .
if you' d known he was going after her , would you have told us ?
no .
do we edit the transcript or let it stand ?
the agency can' t be responsible for some crazy thing bishop did on his own .
i' m sorry ... about bishop .
so am i.
we done here ?
nondisclosure agreement .
aren' t you going to read it ?
read it a thousand times .
aiken , would you escort ...
mr. muirfrom the building ?
dinner with his wife ?
why ?
he said he had four wives .
i' m changing phones .
there was one in germany .
his first wife was korean .
and peggy , that' s three .
he was only married once .
this is black hawk one , we' re inbound .
operation dinner out accomplished .
what did you say ?
nothing .
just that we' re on our way home , sir .
no .
operation what ?
dinner out , sir .
who are the others ?
here it is .
patricia lemour , sandra harrisand peggy dye , all agents or civilian assets .
they were all cover wives .
then who was he talking to ?
there' s been an incident in china .
oh , jesus christ .
spent the last year rocky mountain way
couldn' t get much higher
out to pasture think it' s safe to say
time to open fire
and we don' t need the ladies
crying ' cause the story' s sad
