why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free ?
it' s a fascinating philosophical query , marriage versus sex .
and if you' re considering the former ... ... odds are you' il hear the saying from a friend ... ... who claims to be getting an abundant amount of the latter .
and incidentally , it' s bullshit .
bullshit .
you think this is bullshit .
yeah .
well , it isn' t .
after five years , i think i have the right to broach the subject .
so you broach and we talk .
you don' t have to go and give me an ultimatum .
don' t use that word .
i hate that word .
i' m not too fond of it either , but what else would you call this ?
a deadline .
so i' m a little indecisive .
that doesn' t mean you have to hold a gun to my head .
sorry .
don' t be so melodramatic .
that' s why i' m taking this transfer .
i' il be 3, 000 miles away .
i can' t hold a gun to your head .
stop saying that !
shit .
admit it .
you' re using this transfer thing as an ultim ...
deadline .
okay .
so i wouldn' t have signed up for it if you hadn' t freaked on tyler' s news .
hello .
david !
what' s up , what' s up ?
tyler , you are wasted .
sarah .
damn .
how' d you know , my brother ?
the faux urban street slang .
nigger , please !
what time is it back there , like 2 : 00 ?
you know this city never sleeps .
y' all be counting on your sheep .
listen , man , i met the most amazing woman .
she is ...
fly ?
better than fly .
she' s super fly .
what did i tell you about drinking and dating ?
go to bed and sleep her off .
we' re getting married !
what ?
you got to meet her , you and sarah .
she' s like ...
super fly ?
better than super fly , man .
she' s the one .
you know how they say that you can just tell ?
david ?
you still there , bitch ?
yeah , i' m here .
i' m just ...
this is it , man .
it just hit me .
it was like a blinding realisation .
like pure truth .
anyway , you and sarah got to meet her .
you' re gonna love her .
her name' s julie .
she' s sweet , she' s beautiful ... ... she' s " chocolicious " ...
tyler ?
hello !
tyler , you okay ?
sounds like true love .
so you are leaving me alone to deal with this for two months .
you need to be alone to deal with this .
which is why i strongly advise you against consulting with mike .
bellissimo .
magnifico .
you are so hot !
you beast .
is that ricky martin over there ?
god , no .
it' s mike hanson .
you' re beautiful .
modesty , now .
modesty .
i love you .
no words .
no , i' m not .
yes , i am .
don' t do it .
i' m doing it .
don' t do it .
i did it .
i' d do me .
oh , man !
the " testy " tuck again ?
do you like what you see ?
no ?
would you put on some clothes ?
we only got two hours of " happy hour " left .
let me just get my towel , okay ?
got it .
there we go .
you got issues , i mean , real issues .
he may be your friend , but he' s no deepak chopra .
he is also not running off to new york .
use this time to make an informed decision or none of this' il mean anything .
i can' t let this not mean anything .
so you love her , right ?
of course i love her .
there you go .
let' s not get carried away here , guys .
no one' s doubting your love for each other .
a blind man could smell your love .
but this is a major ...
huge .
no , colossal , thing you' re considering here .
as your friend , it' s my duty to ask the tough questions .
what ?
sex .
sex is still good ?
the sex is awesome .
i' ve got no complaints about what we have .
it would be a lot easier if i did .
it' s got to be something .
you waited five years .
so what is it ?
it' s nothing .
let' s drop it .
we' re your friends .
we want to help you .
but we can' t do it unless you let us in !
it' s no one thing !
there' s a lot of factors in these kind of situations .
so what is it ?
give us one .
other women , all right ?
you' ve had other women ?
how many ?
i' m not quite sure that i' ve had enough .
that' s ridiculous .
how many is enough ?
twice your age .
it' s not about quantity , it' s about quality .
what' s wrong with going for both quality and quantity ?
being the best he can be , that' s the american way .
foul .
foul ?
it' s foul .
what foul ?
humping before the shot .
i was humping you ?
prison style .
whatever .
if i was humping you , you' d know it .
would i ?
yeah , you' d know it .
you' d feel it .
i wasn' t humping you .
deep , right ?
yep .
a little help ?
the thing is , i never expected to feel empowered .
for better , for worse , something is set into motion ... ... and i set it off .
am i a manipulative bitch or what ?
welcome to my world .
you should feel empowered .
it wasn' t easy , but it had to be done .
what was the alternative , to keep waiting ?
it' s not like the sex gets better with every passing year .
am i right ?
i' m sorry that was so quick .
i' m kind of beat .
that' s okay .
orgasms are overrated anyway .
hey , south park is on .
buddy boy , it' s time to shit or get off the pot .
and marrying me would be the " shit " part of that colourful analogy ?
thanks .
i' m sorry , i don' t get it .
sarah is hot .
behind every good looking chick is a guy who' s tired of nailing her .
am i right , davey ?
no , you' re wrong , asshole .
cowgirls , wilder chicks , the amish , what ?
it' s not like that .
let' s just drop it , all right ?
do you guys believe in " the one " ?
as in one soul mate ?
the perfect match that completes us , makes us whole ?
exactly .
hell , no .
i don' t know .
but if there' s such a thing and sarah' s it ... ... then that means it' s inevitable .
it' s a lock , right ?
it' s like destiny .
i guess so .
okay .
so , if it' s inevitable , why rush into it ?
you' re still not telling us everything .
of course , i' m not .
you' re my friends .
it' s stupid , it' s stupid .
come on , help us help you .
please , man .
okay .
i' m going to tell you guys a little story .
i have never told anyone this before .
ever .
when i was 18 years old ... ... my family and i were flying home ... ... from a vacation we took in the caribbean .
it was a fun time .
very nice beaches .
club med .
we were in line to get on board ... ... when i happened to glance over to the gate across from us ... ... and that' s when i saw her .
she glowed .
it was like a light all around her .
it was blinding .
i swear i have never felt anything that powerful before or since .
something about her sucked me away from the plane ... ... and drew me right back to her .
there she was .
with strength i wish i still possessed ... ... i floated towards her .
i introduced myself and told her how i felt .
i gave her my address ... ... and told her if she felt it too , she should write .
young blood had him some balls .
i had no choice .
i was being driven by a higher power .
call it " the lightning bolt , " call it a connection , destiny , whatever .
so did she write you ?
not at first .
every day i' d check that mailbox .
i checked all that summer , and nothing .
then one day , it came .
it was more than i could' ve hoped for .
she professed her love to me .
she said that she , too , got a jolt down her spine ... ... that glorious day we first met .
it was more beautiful and poetic than she was ... ... which i didn' t think was possible at the time .
i immediately wrote her back .
i told her that i wanted us to run away together ... ... make love under the stars .
make babies .
it was clear to both of us .
we belonged together .
no fear , no doubt .
perfect .
young love .
too young .
as it turned out .
apparently she was an amazingly ... ... hyper developed 11 year old girl .
what ?
eleven ?
her parents found my letters and ... ... quite understandably freaked out .
they contacted our local authorities ... ... who swiftly moved in to stop the town' s budding paedophile .
they made my father promise that his sicko son ... ... would cease contact with any more little girls .
they left him to scream at me for over an hour about ... ... how i could flush any chances of a political career down the toilet .
that' s a fucked up story , man .
you' re the only people i' ve ever told .
can you keep it that way ?
it makes you seem kind of creepy .
david collins graphics .
hey .
sarah , hey , how are you ?
i just thought i' d call and see how you were .
i' m fine .
how are you ?
how' s new york ?
busy .
but the city is so incredible .
i wish you were here with me .
oops , shit .
oops , shit , " what ?
why " oops , shit " ?
i made a list of all the things i wasn' t going to ... ... say to you like , " i miss you .
i wish you were here .
so how are you ?
miss you .
wish you were here , all that .
i talked to tyler .
he and i are going to try to get together for dinner .
so maybe i' il get to meet the fiancee .
great .
be sure and thank them for ruining my life .
listen , i just wanted to let you know that i made it here okay .
oh .
is that it ?
well , i got to get back to work .
so i should go .
yeah , me , too .
okay .
' bye , david .
i' m just saying , it' s been a week and a half now ... ... and all you' ve done is sit around the apartment .
it' s no good .
she wants me to give the situation serious thought ... ... that' s exactly what i' m trying to do .
finish it , tiny !
and how' s that working out so far ?
been doing a lot of thinking ?
no !
you are useless !
what was that ?
he can' t do that .
actually , i think he can .
she wants me to make an informed decision ... ... and i' m gonna respect that .
no , what she wants is for you to wallow around your apartment ... ... like some socially retarded hermit .
ante up .
who do you like ?
give me $5 on super thong .
i' m gonna take the one with the nice rack .
she is banking on your misery , bro , hoping you' il sit around bumming out .
that' s got to hurt .
and that , my friend , is how you make an uninformed decision .
you want to make a truly informed decision ?
get off your ass and go see what it' s like out there .
get in the game .
the game ?
i. e .
hitting the meat market clubs with you .
no .
hitting them with me and jonesy .
there are some major fundamental problems i have with ... ... " why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free ? " conundrum .
for one thing , women are not cows .
and by that i mean , not so generic .
i think most reasonable people would agree ... ... that a cow is a cow is a cow .
this is not true of women .
things might be simpler if it were .
yo , mike !
excuse me .
scotch .
it' s packed .
yeah , busy .
thank you .
excuse me .
you might have offered to help me .
if you please ?
a beer for my friend ?
thank you .
i' m sorry to do this to you , but i got to go .
hey , asshole , what is your problem ?
you shouldn' t drink anymore .
why shouldn' t i ?
i just got here .
because you' re driving me home .
oh , god .
oh , god .
hey .
buy you a drink ?
actually , i' m think i' m gonna leave .
you aren' t married , are you ?
not yet .
you better hurry , though .
another round .
did mikey show ?
yes .
cute .
how' d he play ?
actually , i think he used the " you' re less than nothing to me " strategy .
it never fails , man .
you miss her , huh ?
are you kidding ?
surrounded by all these available women ?
more than ever .
i know the feeling , only worse .
imagine feeling like that in this place without having anybody to miss .
how you doing ?
you ready to go ?
okay , so you had a close encounter with something .
you saw the light in the airport .
and 10 years later , it' s still messing with your head .
it was important .
it set the bar for me on some level .
is that so bad ?
it' s bad if it keeps you from hooking up with a woman ... ... who' s attractive , smart , and of legal , consenting age .
what if she' s still out there ?
don' t i owe it to myself ... ... to try and find her ?
you' re hunting sasquatch .
see .
there she is .
the shadow lady ?
she' s a sasquatch ?
she' s a myth .
the perfect woman .
a figment of our dumb ass male imagination .
slap a face on the shadow bitch , and she ceases to be perfect ... ... because she becomes real .
so what exactly is all this crap ?
it' s market research .
insurance for the creatives who came up with this shitty campaign .
if i can coerce a focus group ... ... to say that a picture of an anorexic model ... ... bottle feeding two large men in diapers ... ... makes them want to buy a pair of jeans , then i' ve done my job .
that is a twisted way to make a living .
i know .
but at least it' s the fashion biz , right ?
so why don' t you just move here ?
i don' t know .
maybe i will .
who is that ?
it' s mr. hahn .
my boss .
and you get paid ?
look at it mathematically .
if just one person hooks up with somebody who isn' t their soul mate ... ... you got a chain reaction that screws it up for everybody on the planet .
your soul mate ends up with someone else' s who settles for someone else' s ...
which makes it all the more important to find the right person .
it' s a glass half empty , glass half full scenario .
if you ask me , the glass is half full of crap .
you sure you don' t want any late night eats ?
no .
i' m out of here .
take care , man .
you got a problem ?
how' s the chili ?
i' d give my right arm for a bowl .
i' il hand that ...
i' il have that .
oh , my god .
my god , that was the glow .
that was the feeling you got in the airport .
it' s happening again .
i' m gonna do this .
can you do this ?
you' ve done it before , you can do it again .
go !
i' m gonna do this .
i' m gonna do this .
can you ?
can you ?
don' t let her get away .
where did she go ?
where did that girl go ?
what' s your problem ?
she left , crap sack .
creep .
wait up !
stop !
stop !
stop !
wait up !
don' t go !
don' t !
quick match personals .
may i help you ?
i' d like to place a personal ad .
i' m sorry , can you please speak up ?
a personal ad .
i want to place a personal ...
hello .
is anyone there ?
hello ?
i' m sorry .
i dropped the phone .
i' m here .
this is my first time .
okay .
here goes .
wanted ... ... soul mate .
potential soul mate looking for his soul mate .
you , soul mate material .
me , open , intelligent , and ...
soul matey ?
yes .
who' s dead ?
somebody better be dead .
hey , tyler , it' s mikey .
did i wake you ?
what time is it ?
it' s 1 : 00 in the morning , 4 : 00 to you .
sorry , man .
what' s wrong ?
what happened ?
nothing .
i just wanted to talk .
at 4 : 00 in the morning ?
it' s cheaper .
listen , ty , how' d you do it ?
how' d i do what ?
how did you , you know ...
how did you find somebody who made the cut ?
i don' t know .
it was just this feeling that hit me .
like a blinding realisation , like pure truth .
mikey , what is this all about ?
nothing .
nothing .
forget it .
congratulations .
mike ?
yeah ?
pull this shit again , you don' t get to be my best man .
yeah , yeah , yeah .
always a best man , never a man .
oh , my god , this is so exciting .
i think i just met naomi campbell' s hair person .
so , anything i should be doing ?
this is the glamorous world of market research .
we just sit around until somebody wonders .
why are those men wearing diapers ?
i guess i can answer that question for you , sir .
you can answer that ?
yes .
we did research in the midwest which indicated ... ... that our target market was getting younger and younger ... ... as you can see .
our focus groups taught us that it' d be wise to do a preemptive strike ... ... and showcase young imagery in our new campaigns .
i see and this explains why i' m spending $2 million ... ... putting grown men in huggies .
you realise if i did this in my basement ... ... and post them on the internet , i' d be arrested .
also save a lot of money .
what are you doing for lunch ?
i' m sorry julie couldn' t make it tonight .
she really does want to meet you .
me , too .
yeah .
but at least now you can tell me how all of this happened .
you used to refer to marriage as ...
i know , cruel and unusual punishment .
it' s her .
she just hit me like a truck .
but you were ready for it , right ?
you were wandering around in traffic ?
yeah , i guess it was in traffic .
i mean , if it can happen to me , it can happen to anybody .
right ?
anybody who isn' t mike , of course .
i actually got a strange call from mike the other day .
i think he seemed genuinely concerned not to have somebody in his life .
mike , in a relationship ?
isn' t that one of the signs of the apocalypse ?
nostradamus actually predicted it .
he said , in the latter part of the twentieth century ... ... " the lone cock would crow no more .
that' s scary .
why do you think david' s so reluctant to take the next step with me ?
oh , david .
i was playing the field , and i got burned out on it .
david hasn' t exactly been out playing the field .
he' s been playing house with me .
a fun game .
so let me get this straight .
by working in a relationship with this guy for the past five years ... ... i have actually undermined any possibility of a future with him ?
yeah .
maybe .
i don' t know .
david' s a really sharp guy ... ... and i think he' il probably come to his senses .
i mean , you' re all he wants .
i' m all he knows .
that can work .
david , it' s me .
it' s late and you' re not home .
that' s good .
i hope you' re out having fun .
i know this sounds weird ... ... but if you need to see other women to figure this out ... ... i can handle it .
maybe it' s being here on my own or from asking you for a decision .
i' ve gained a new perspective on things .
i think it' s important for us to explore whatever options we need to .
so , if that' s part of it for you just know that i understand .
i know what you mean .
she second guessed our move .
she' s even more cunning than i thought .
she' s good .
you' re lucky i' m on board .
it' s not like her .
why would she say it' s okay to go out with other women ?
why indeed ?
shouldn' t you be out there playing wingman for jonesy ?
oh , please .
i never realised you were so picky .
you think i' m one of these assy scam hounds ?
i have very particular tastes .
a strict list of qualities i look for in a woman .
i' m not just fucking around out here .
what ?
seriously , all this play i get ?
i' m not wasting my time .
it' s practice .
it' s practice for the big game .
maybe it' s not a game .
you' ve been off the circuit too long .
of course , it' s a game .
it' s better than a game , it' s a sport .
it' s better than a sport , even .
it' s sport fishing .
case in point .
look at him .
see those chicks he' s wasting it on .
hi , ladies !
those are bass .
and we all go bass fishing from time to time .
hell , you can get really good at it with practice .
but while he' s spending all his time hooking up with bottom feeders ... ... the crucial skills he' il need to hook his wife are atrophying .
you see , scamming is like fishing .
if your dream girl were a fish , what would she be ?
i don' t know , a tuna ?
yeah !
no .
a marlin .
a big trophy fish .
to catch a marlin , you must use entirely different skills .
you don' t go out marlin fishing with a sorry ass fold out pole , six pound test .
that' il do for bass .
but it sure as shit isn' t gonna land a marlin .
you have to up your game .
know where the elusive beauties lie .
you gotta know where to fish .
they' re rare , brother .
they' re rare .
most days you don' t catch shit .
but when you do ...
wham !
the two of you are back at the dock taking pictures .
okay , another huge flaw i have ... ... with " why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free ? " ... ... is simply this .
milk is not free .
the point is , if you' re hankering for some milk ... ... one way or another , you' re gonna have to pay for it !
you digging this , davey ?
i told you i' d make it up to you .
please point out which of these lovely young ladies is a marlin .
we' re done fishing for the day .
we' re at the aquarium now , checking out the exotic fishies .
look , davey .
they even got one of those petting tanks .
oh , my god .
i have already told him all about you , and his friend is totally hot .
sarah , come on .
you have got to get my back .
i have been after this guy for almost a week .
they' re gonna be here in an hour .
so , come on , just get my back .
i have to go .
i' il do what i can .
' bye .
hi .
hey .
have you given any thought to our conversation the other day ?
it' s all i' ve been thinking about .
but the problem is , i' m involved with someone back in la .
but i' m not sure what' s happening with us .
i just need a little more time to figure it out .
is that okay ?
of course .
just don' t take too long .
gosh , a dollar .
now i can quit stripping , go back to vet school ... ... and save my sick pony .
thanks , mike .
you' re a prince .
amy !
david , you know her !
holy shit !
it is amy .
give me a sec .
i have to make one last go around .
you guys know her ?
from school .
i can' t believe this is happening .
i can' t believe this is happening .
she looks great .
she definitely lost that " freshman 15 .
she looks hot .
damn !
hey , you guys .
how are you two ?
you work here ?
this is awesome .
no , mike , i' m just hanging .
this is such a surprise .
yeah .
you look good , david .
amy , this is jonesy .
jonesy , this is amy .
how you doing ?
pleasure to meet you .
the pleasure is all mine .
why don' t you turn it down a notch ?
you' re channelling barry white again .
was she this hot when you two were dating ?
he went out with a stripper ?
yeah .
actually , no .
i was just a freshman back then ... ... studying to be a stripper .
david helped me bone up on my pole dancing exam .
can i buy you a drink for old times ' sake ?
yeah .
come on .
they' re going to do it .
i often wonder how long we would' ve lasted if i hadn' t broken up with you .
two and a half days .
i was gonna dump you right after my last final .
i didn' t have the time to get into a big emotional thing with you .
i had to study .
what a relief .
this whole time , i thought i broke your heart .
give me a break .
we weren' t in love or anything .
we were just having fun .
there were no expectations back then .
give me a hand with this .
i mean , when did that change ?
it didn' t .
you did .
it only seems different now because you outgrew it .
i don' t know .
i do .
look at your dick with ears friend there .
do you think that amy chick would take the bid ?
i thought that was dave' s old flame .
key word : " was .
damn it !
i bet i could have had her .
when she was going out with your best friend .
yeah , that would have been real cool .
you bet .
although , i' m sure she wasn' t as hot then .
you look unbelievable .
thanks .
when did it get so difficult to figure out what i want ?
if you' re like most people , darlin ' ... ... right around the time you found something worth wanting .
hand me that dildo , will you ?
she circled my ad .

your ad intrigued me , soul mate .
i love dressing up and getting down .
i' m a walking contradiction ... ... open minded , yet lactose intolerant .
and i yearn for someone who enjoys big surprises .
call me .
if you' d like to make a call , please hang up and try again .
hello , david .
i' ve been waiting for your call ... ... ever since i saw you in that mexican restaurant .
i' ve fantasised about us .
our bodies entwined and covered in salsa .
salsa !
we' re destined to be together , david .
it' s just like ...
chips and salsa .
that' s right .
and now ...
that' s my other line .

this is important .
mike .
david , it' s happened to me .
congratulations .
look , i' m really not feeling very ...
no !
listen , david .
i' m lying naked , in a strange bed ... ... staring at the most beautiful woman ... ... i have ever seen in my entire life .
tell her i said , " hi .
i' ve really got to go now .
she' s not here .
i' m looking at her picture , okay ?
damn marlin jumped right into my boat , caught me unawares .
what are you talking about ?
that whole after hours rave ?
complete blank .
the last solid memory i have was drinking some green , glowy shit ... ... from a test tube and dancing like a bastard .
but , david ...
what ?
something magical happened in this room last night .
something ... ... bigger than sex .
although sex was definitely a factor .
but you don' t remember .
no .
last night' s a total blur .
but listen to me .
i woke up this morning and i' ve got ...
... the feeling .
is it a burning sensation ?
no , david .
the feeling ... ... when you just know the pure , blinding truth stuff .
i' ve met her , david .
for the first time in my life , i think i' m in love .
me .
shit .
here she comes .
moment of truth .
' bye .
good morning , sunshine !
is that for me ?
whoops .
you' ve been , deflowered .
i can' t believe you' re even up after that performance last night .
in my book , you deserve to sleep for a week .
hungover and clumsy .
i' il take care of that .
you just save your strength .
the bathroom ?
what ?
the bathroom .
i don' t feel too well .
it' s right around the corner , lover .
you pretty boys are all the same .
strong stamina and weak stomachs .
it' s right there .
you okay in there ?
this isn' t happening .
michael ?
just a sec !
laura was pretty impressed with you last night ... ... even before you two started waking the neighbourhood .
i' m into chicks .
i love chicks .
breasts , legs , long hair .
and breasts .
i' ve never seen her make breakfast for herself .
and we' ve been roommates for three years .
laura ran to the store to get you some b12 ... ... and she should be back soon .
dad .
sit down .
i' m gay .
no !
or i was fucked up or experimenting .
you know , like mom' s college years .
oh , god , it is genetic .
michael , i' il be out on the deck , okay ?

i' m in town for my cousin' s bar mitzvah .
what are you doing ?
i' m leaving .
this place is such a meat market .
it' s a total singles scene .
did you just call him david ?
yeah .
that is his name .
it' s my nickname .
my close friends call me that .
david , what are you talking about ?
who the hell has david for a nickname ?
i do .
it' s short for davidian .
branch davidian .
are you here to meet a david , too ?
yeah .
who are you ?
did you answer an ad in quick match personals ?
david , do you know these women ?
you son of a ...
soul mate , my ass !
stop it , please !
excuse me , i' m supposed to meet someone here named ...
some shit monkey invited four women from the same dating service !
why ?
why ?
look , just get down here , all right ?
and send ambulances , lots of them .
i' m sorry !
i' m sorry !
i' ve been a bad boy !
i' m sorry !
how does it look ?
is it bad ?
no .
you' re good .
so , we' re about the same age .
tell me , how does one develop such intense hatred for women ... ... in a short amount of time ?
publicly humiliating four women you' ve never met before ?
i thought maybe i had met one of them before .
i was wrong .
go ahead , call sarah .
rat my miserable ass out .
forget it .
i' d lash out at an entire gender too if i had your problems .
it must be tough .
you' re the last person i would have expected sympathy from on all this .
it can' t be easy .
especially now .
what do you mean , now ?
maybe you' d better call her .
sarah , pick up the damn ...
hello .
hello , sarah ?
this is amber .
i work with sarah .
can i take a message ?
i need to know where she is .
she left a little early today .
had a dinner engagement .
an appointment .
with who ?
who is this ?
this is her boyfriend , david .
i didn' t know she had a boyfriend .
she does .
listen , i' m sorry .
i really don' t know who you are ... ... but i' d appreciate it if you told me who she was ...
she' s out with andrew .
mr. hahn .
mr. hung ?
yeah , the big guy .
are you sure you' re her boyfriend ?
i mean , she knows that you' re her boyfriend and everything right ?
so how long have you been married ?
seven years .
must be nice to have that kind of security .
i' m the poster boy for happily married .
but security , that' s a rare thing these days ... ... especially in marriage .
that' s a sombre outlook for the happily married , poster boy .
fifty percent divorce rate in the us .
the only security you have in this world is yourself .
the point i' m making , sarah , is your talent is yours alone .
and you do have talent , sarah .
your designs are amazing .
only you can decide what you want to do with that talent .
i just wish it were simpler .
simpler ?
i' m offering you a job in new york doing what you love doing .
i know .
and it' s a dream come true .
dreams don' t come true very often .
maybe it' s not supposed to be simple .
bellissimo .
magnifico .
mike , it' s me .
where you been , man ?
i haven' t heard from you since you met your true love .
i' ve really got to talk to you .
so why don' t you just pick up the phone and give me a call between orgasms , okay ?
from the makers of the hit videos , are you gay ? ... and so you think you' re gay ... ... united homosexual headquarters presents ... ... just how gay are you ?
hello .
i' m tim chadway ... ... president of united homosexual headquarters .
my buddies call me timbo .
you know , like millions of americans ... ... you' re probably wondering just how gay are you ?
that' s an important question .
but , come on , the answer is pretty obvious , isn' t it ?
face it , chief .
if you' re watching me now , you are pretty damn gay .
but that' s okay .
because , you see , here at the headquarters ... ... we specialise in making your journey out of the closet ... ... as smooth as possible .
from our handy gay pride starter kit ... ... to those convenient , " i' m here , i' m queer ...
... stop by sometime for a beer " change of sexual orientation post cards ... ... you' il be out and about in no time .
your family and friends will admire you ... ... for your ability to make that transition with style and flair .
i still can' t believe it .
why don' t you just call her ?
you don' t even know for sure what' s going on .
if she wants to talk , she can give me a call .
i' m done sitting around like a sucker .
you got to stop being hard on yourself .
mike was right .
if i' m gonna make an informed decision , it' s time i started getting busy .
wait a minute .
what' s this bar that mike wants us to meet him at ?
the cock pit .
you might want to wait till tomorrow night to start getting busy .
why is that ?
because tonight , we' re drinking in boys ' town .
a lot of guys claim they practically knew it in the womb .
like something was wrong ... ... they felt different than all the other fetuses .
how did you figure it out ?
after a string of girlfriends ... ... a couple ex wives , and a great dane or two ... ... i started thinking , " hey , maybe it' s me .
was that difficult for you ?
sure .
most terrifying thing that you can do is look inside yourself carefully , honestly .
but you have to do it , michael .
and when i did , it was a feeling that just hit me .
a blinding realisation like pure truth .
mike , what' s up ?
guys , hey !
sit down .
are you aware that this is a ...
a gay bar ?
it' s okay to say it .
and yes , i know .
but i like it , i think .
i' m trying to , anyway .
stanley !
a beer for my friends , please .
i get it .
i get it .
you do ?
he' s trying to go the distance with that chick he met at after hours .
right .
avoiding places that tempt you to stray ... ... off the gilded path of monogamy .
i can' t wait to meet this girl .
she must really be something .
she didn' t ... ... turn out to be the person i thought she was .
sorry , man .
i' m sorry .
she sounded different .
let' s just drop it , okay ?
so what' s up with this bar ?
this isn' t really our kind of place .
what do you mean ?
it' s got beer .
it' s got bar stools .
what more do you need , jonesy ?
how about women ?
i' m shocked .
i never would have pegged you two as homophobes .
what the hell do you guys have against gay people , anyway ?
we' ve got nothing against gays .
some of my best friends ' friends are gay .
that' s right .
holy shit .
what' s that ?
the mikey chronicles , man .
the sacred scam scrolls .
this is the black book ?
i want you to have it , david .
i don' t need it anymore .
look at all these numbers .
what are these little black diamonds ?
stick to the blue squares .
i' d hate to see you get hurt .
this is bigger than i thought .
that chick must have really snuck up from behind and nailed you .
david ?
you must be nikki .
i hope i' m not too early .
so you' re a friend of mike' s ?
yeah .
david , mike owes me $200 .
is cash okay ?
hi .
come on in .
david .
what are you doing here ?
if you' re this upset , then why has it taken you two weeks to call me back ?
i' ve been busy .
never mind that .
who' s this guy ?
he' s my boss .
and all he did was offer me a new position .
what' s the matter , our old positions aren' t good enough for you anymore ?
as a designer .
he wants an answer , but i told him i had to talk to you first .
this is about more than a job offer .
you tell me to explore , to meet other women .
that' s got nothing to do with this .
i can' t make a decision until i know all the variables ... ... one of which is still in your hands .
great .
so now i' m just a variable .
this has just gotten more complicated .
why don' t you just admit it ?
you love it there .
you don' t want to say no to this offer and i' m not going to be a reason you do .
look , if you already have made up your mind , then say so .
but don' t try to hide behind some noble gesture ... ... of not holding me back .
why don' t we be fair here ?
things have changed , sarah .
this is no longer just my decision .
you' re right , it isn' t .
and that' s why i' m coming home early .
what ?
they' re paying for me to come home and talk to you .
they really want me , david .
possibly more than you do .
oh , shit .
dave !
what' s up , man ?
de bachelorising for the little lady .
she gets back today .
what' s up ?
you didn' t get me a coffee ?
i didn' t know how you took it .
but here , i grabbed your mail on the way in .
so what' s the verdict ?
i get to comb the thrift stores for a new , used suit or what ?
not yet .
i' m just as confused as ever .
are you all right ?
just lock up when you leave .
what ?
i wasn' t sure if you' d be here .
i' m here .
where else would i be ?
what' s this ?
i' m going to new york .
what ?
what ?
there' s somebody i got to see .
what are you talking about ?
options , remember ?
just in case .
you' re out of options !
this means staying here or going back .
these are your options .
sarah .
no , listen .
listen to me carefully .
i flew back here for one reason ... ... and that was to give you a chance to talk me out of taking this job .
i can' t do that until i do this .
i won' t be here when you get back .
i swear to god , i won' t .
this is it , david .
i know .
there are times in life when you have to make extremely difficult choices .
and there are times when it seems like you don' t have a choice at all .
like those rare moments ... ... when your only option practically shows up in your mailbox .
david !
tyler .
i' m psyched you' re here .
you look great .
it really means a lot to me .
so what the hell are you doing here ?
i know it' s sudden .
i just wanted to see you .
things are gonna start getting crazy for you and julie .
and i wanted to see you .
both of you .
i talked to sarah , you know .
she said that you guys met up when she was in town .
no .
i talked to her about three hours ago .
she called , while you were in the air , from la .
she' s freaking out .
everything' s fine .
i know what you' re going through .
it' s a scary leap .
the trick is you have to let go of your fears ... ... and just kind of go for it .
believe me , the worst thing you can do is lose the right girl ... ... because of a fear of commitment .
the worst thing you can do is marry the wrong girl ... ... because of a fear of loneliness .
i can' t wait for you to meet her .
i' ve told her all about you .
you have ?
yeah .
i told her about all you guys .
i had to warn her .
even my name ?
you didn' t mention my name .
no , of course not your name .
we refer to you all by your general nature , like the indians .
mike is " fucks whatever moves .
you' re " dances around major life decisions .
what' d she say , when you mentioned my name ?
what is wrong with you ?
i' m sorry .
what would she possibly say about ...
oh , there she is .
this is david .
david , this is julie .
so nice to finally meet you .
i feel like i already know you .
i feel the same way .
isn' t she beautiful ?
you look like i did first time i laid eyes on her .
i just knew right away .
it hit me like a blinding realisation , like ...
pure truth .
was he always this sappy ?
since i met you , baby .
will you order me a drink ?
i' m going to go to the ladies ' room .
excuse me .
now you know , buddy .
now you understand .
that' s it .
this guy jeff works at tyler' s firm ... ... knew my roommate , and they hooked us up .
end of story .
that' s ...
wow , what a story .
the important thing is that you ended up together ?
yeah .
i mean , think of all the people you' ve met in your lives .
all the paths taken , not taken .
you can probably trace back to your very first romantic memory .
lf you tried .
oh , yeah .
fifth grade drama class .
miss liska had us lie on the ground and pretend we were driftwood .
and then as she walked around the " beach " ... ... she would step over us ...
we get it .
that' s nice , sweetie .
what about you , julie ?
oh , no .
the airport guy ?
the airport guy ?
what about the airport guy ?
tell me about this airport guy .
it' s okay , honey .
he' s a friend .
okay .
i was travelling with my family once .
we were in an airport ... ... and this guy came up to me from out of nowhere .
and he started , saying all these strange things to me ... ... about how he felt something when he saw me ... ... and he wondered if i felt it , too .
i didn' t know what to say , so i just kind of smiled at him .
he gave me his address ... ... and asked , if i felt the same i should write him .
and as he walked away , i had this frozen grin on my face .
i didn' t want to agitate him or anything .
i was terrified that he was going to hurt me .
can you believe that ?
how old were you , honey ?
eleven .
eleven years old .
if that son of a bitch were here right now ...
but you wrote him !
i mean , did you ever write him ?
no .
of course not .
honey , do you want me to finish the story for you ?
there' s more ?
yeah .
no , it' s okay .
i can do this .
so as soon as the guy was gone i threw the address away .
but what i didn' t know at the time was that my little sister katie ... ... who was two years younger than me ... ... saw everything .
she wanted to be like me .
she worshipped me and she started writing this creep , as me .
she even sent him my picture .
then , of course , when he wrote back ... ... weird stuff about how he wanted to run away with her ... ... and make babies .
can you imagine that ?
make babies ?
and this is before the internet .
what a sicko .
i' m sorry , honey .
are you all right ?
but ... ... did you ever find out who this guy was ?
my parents did .
sort of .
they overheard katie bragging to me about her boyfriend .
she had mentioned it before ... ... so we just assumed it was this imaginary play friend or something .
but when she started telling me about how he' d promised to run away with her ... ... and make love to her ...
under the stars . ... they stepped in .
she was only nine .
so my dad called the authorities ... ... gave them the guy' s address ... ... and , as was his style , told us to forget the whole thing !
it wasn' t until years later ... ... that i realized the guy thought he was writing me .
and then i pieced it together , and i remembered the airport incident .
but i never told anyone .
i have to go .
are you all right ?
where are you going ?
i have to ...
thank you for the ...
congratulations with ...
good bye .
i' d seen the light .
it was this glaringly obvious , blind realisation ... ... like pure truth .
and it was not about anyone in particular , but about people in general .
i realised at that moment there is no such thing as " the one .
it' s more of a mind boggling , whole hell of a lot of potential ones .
and while that should be comforting , it was actually pretty terrifying .
we' d all like to kick back and wait for some magical force ... ... to show us who we should spend the rest of our lives with .
but the truth is ... ... there isn' t a lightning bolt to slap you on the ass ... ... and tell you to pick this person over all others .
if anything , it' s like the rain .
rain falls all the time .
sometimes you' re prepared for it , sometimes you' re not .
depending where you are when it hits you either get caught or you don' t .
in fact , most of us usually try like hell to avoid it .
you might miss the bus .
you might catch the bus .
maybe you remembered your umbrella , maybe you didn' t .
no big signs .
just random , torrential bursts of opportunity .
and that' s the most fate can do .
the rest is up to us .
and now , by the power vested in me ... ... i now pronounce you husband and wife .
you may kiss the bride .
so the eternal bachelor was the first one to go .
i don' t think i' il ever understand men .
you look amazing .
thanks .
i' m very happy for you .
i mean it .
thanks .
i had a tough time for those first few months .
it was really hard .
but then i had to take nicole to the emergency room ... ... to get her stomach pumped again and there he was .
our eyes just met ... ... and it was like this indescribable feeling like ...
i get it .
not that happy yet .
it' s terrific you found someone who deserves you .
but i' d be lying if i said i didn' t miss our friendship .
okay .
i think it' s time to stir things up on the dance floor .
join me ?
i think i' il pass .
i didn' t bring any singles with me .
joke .
please remember there are impressionable children out there .
let' s keep it pg 13 .
no problem .
hand me that dildo , will you ?
amy .
yeah .
haven' t seen her since college .
she' s great .
you two ...
no .
we' re just friends .
i saw that goofy looking bastard that sarah' s with .
that guy , he' s like missing a chromosome or something .
what a freak .
we both know he' s an attractive guy .
but , thank you for trying .
i bet he' s no brain surgeon .
shit .
really ?
there you are .
baby , you remember david .
you met him at the restaurant a couple months ago .
glad you didn' t have to rush out early today .
it was a beautiful ceremony .
thank you .
i' m just glad my little sister got to catch the end .
katie showed up ?
honey , that' s great .
i didn' t think she would make it .
what happened ?
your sister is here ?
yeah .
but she doesn' t like weddings .
she never got over that airport guy .
the paedophile , the sicko .
asshole .
honey , settle down .
you know i should really introduce you two .
you would totally hit it off .
what a great idea .
why don' t you go get her ?
no , no .
that' s not necessary .
virgin .
hot .
i think i see her .
stay here .
i' il be right back .
what' s the matter ?
you look like you did the night at the restaurant when you ...
i have to go . ... bolted .
lightning taxi .
hi .
i need a cab .
fast .
ladies and gentlemen at this time , mike hanson , the best man ... ... would like to make a toast to julie and tyler .
all right , thank you .
thank you .
many of you don' t know me ... ... but i had the pleasure of being ... ... tyler' s roommate in our fraternity house at school .
yeah , you were !
phi lamb !
who' s my boy , mikey ?
you' re my boy !
and today i have the privilege ... ... of being the best man in his wedding .
suffice it to say , i was shocked to hear that he was getting married .
but over time as i talked to him on the phone ... ... i began to understand .
we used to do everything together .
we were joined at the hip .
it struck me that what these two people were doing ... ... was giving themselves in to ... ... a blinding realisation .
pure truth .
they stood before everyone they knew and confessed their new found selves .
i don' t know , but witnessing such strength ... ... and courage in my friends ... ... inspires me in a way which i can barely put into words .
you see , while many of you don' t know me ... ... the rest of you only think you do .
the truth is you' re about to meet mike hanson for the first time .
my name is mike hanson ... ... and i' m a raging homosexual .
thank you .
i didn' t really know him that well .
and let' s give it up to the newlyweds .
congrats , guys .
hit it .
why does everybody keep trying to set me up ?
they' re never him .
katie , please come out and meet him .
you look amazing .
all right , let' s go meet this guy .
ladies !
there you are !
katie , i' m so glad that you could make it .
thank you .
we have to go .
the limo is here .
wait .
have you seen david ?
no .
i think he left with mike and amy because i haven' t seen them , either .
but you know what ?
we should forget about them .
i' m gonna meet you up front .
we really have to go .
it' s okay .
you just go .
no .
you' re coming with us .
no .
it' s your day .
don' t worry about me .
i' il be fine .
are you sure ?
positive .
just go , all right ?
love you .
love you , too .
so , i don' t mean to belittle your big announcement ... ... but come on , mike , you never even worked retail .
it makes sense .
all my life i' ve treated women like dirt , never letting them get too close ... ... just using and cruising .
that doesn' t make you a homosexual .
it makes you an asshole .
excuse me , are you waiting for someone ?
no , i' m not waiting , i' m not waiting .
wait a minute , that' s my cab !
that' s my ...
these insolent swine !
they call you and they tell you to come right away .
big hurry !
and you come , they' re not there .
and i feel like ...
how do you say , " assholes " ?
yeah , i know the feeling .
you know the feeling ?
do you know the feeling ?
so it was nice wedding , yes ?
no , not again !
my god !
no , no .
please get up .
are you all right ?
it' s you .
i have been looking everywhere for you .
what took you so long ?
i feel all tingly inside .
i know .
so do i.
no , in a scary way .
right .
we should get you to a hospital .
what are you doing ?
you said you were gay .
yeah , and your point is ?
