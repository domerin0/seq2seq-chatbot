in the year 1954 , half a century ago ... ... our country suffered a terrible attack by godzilla .
our capital was a battlefield .
only the courage of the men before us ... ... saved this country from total destruction .
that battle was the only real battle ... ... that our self defense forces have had to fight ... ... since their foundation in that same year , 1954 .
since then , our country has enjoyed a long period of prosperity .
however , the peril has not disappeared .
a few years ago ... ... another giant monster attacked eastern america at new york city .
since that attack ... ... there have been numerous sightings in various countries .
the new york attack was godzilla , right ?
that' s what all the american experts claim .
but our guys here have some doubts .
the database is constantly being updated with new information .
what' s that ?
dismissed !
division , attention !
hey , a u. s. nuclear sub' s missing .
prepare for a news flash !
come on , let' s get moving !
hurry up , hurry up .
an american nuclear submarine ... ... is missing off guam in international waters .
this morning , the navy sent a search and rescue unit ... ... to help locate the missing submarine and its crew members .
because of the potential nuclear risk ... ... the navy is dispatching its rescue submersible satsuma .
a navy cruiser with the satsuma onboard ... ... will be leaving the port of yokosuka later today .
both vessels will be helping the americans with their rescue efforts .
satsuma approaching search area .
there seems to have been an explosion .
i can' t control it !
hey , what' s going on ?
what' s happening down there ?
what' s that on the screen ?
i don' t believe it !
it can' t be happening !
traditionally , mt .
myoko was thought to be ... ... the ancient gateway to the lost world .
we' re here to solve a mystery as ancient as the mountain itself ... ... and that mystery concerns the monster of the mountain .
what was that , the monster ?
all right !
cut !
hey , you !
stop it !
stop shooting !
you hear me ?
stop shooting immediately !
do you hear ?
what do you mean ?
look .
we have a permit to film here .
you didn' t say it was gonna be a work of fiction .
no , it was supposed to be a documentary !
look , it' s a " docu drama , " if you like .
you call it what you like .
i looked up your bs digital q.
specialized in low budget drama series .
favorite themes are esp and alien life forms .
we don' t want you people ruining the reputation of honest villagers .
now , get lost !
oh , please don' t be like that , sir .
think of the kids .
they love stories of ghosts and monsters .
in the states , there are many stories about witches .
they' ve made some of the villages famous worldwide .
godzilla could do that too .
if godzilla did come into your village , think of it .
everyone in japan would want to come here .
and do you think he will come ?
an earthquake !
don' t worry !
what was that ?
it' s all right .
it' s over .
i' m sorry .
wow , that was something !
so may we continue , please , sir ?
sure , you go right ahead .
yes , i' m sure your film is going to attract thousands of tourists .
thanks !
great .
right , okay .
hey , the camera , you got it ?
it' s here .
our village will be famous the world over .
i was even interviewed on camera .
and who knows ?
you may become a movie star .
let' s go .
did you see what they did ?
they wrecked it !
what the hell are you doing ?
you' re gonna kill yourselves .
an earthquake .
hold it !
there was an earthquake last night .
didn' t you hear about it ?
i just can' t understand it , it wasn' t recorded !
maybe it was just too far away .
but the epicenter moved !
what ?
hey , what are you talking about ?
that' s not all .
i heard an eerie voice as well .
let me take a crew and check it out .
i got a hunch about this .
a hunch ?
yeah .
our specialty is making cheap sci fi series ... ... not investigative reporting .
this could be a great chance to make something worthwhile .
if we want to survive ... ... we' re gonna have to concentrate on quality .
look , our clients expect us to make low budget stuff ... ... not news documentaries .
we' re right above the tunnel now , 10 miles south of mount myoko .
this is where 20 people were buried alive .
the road has been closed ... ... and rescue operations are continuing to find the bodies .
the entrance to the tunnel is blocked by tons of rock ... ... and access is , for now , impossible .
all right .
lift it slowly !
help them !
d3 unit locked on target !
fire !
and will it explode once inside ?
what if the explosion' s too strong ?
don' t worry .
it' s under control .
you said there' s a witness ?
oh , sure , sure .
here .
it had a big head and a big mouth .
and you say the thing was alive ?
yeah .
godzilla .
it' s godzilla !
i sometimes wish i' d been born a man .
why' s that ?
i think you make a great girl .
because i' m not allowed to make the programs i want to make .
as a woman , you' re expected to do as you' re told .
that sucks , don' t you think ?
good evening !
hey !
so who' s this ?
so you got my message ?
no one believes the moving epicenter story , i' m afraid .
however ...
the guardian monsters .
it may be a clue to what happened yesterday .
it makes interesting reading , believe me .
who' s he ?
goddamn mutt !
what' s the matter ?
i don' t like dogs .
don' t worry , i' il get rid of him .
why don' t we get rid of the dog .
just dump it overboard !
hey , i think they fell overboard .
what the hell' s going on ?
what' s the matter ?
can' t you ... ?
help me !
hey , what is that ?
i just brought yuri home , sir .
so i see .
i' m grateful to you .
it' s okay .
father !
what a nice surprise .
daughter yuri reporting for duty .
i don' t find this funny , okay ?
i' m sorry for all the trouble .
no , really , here .
good night , sir .
see you tomorrow .
you' re drunk again !
no , i' m not drunk .
i' il make some coffee and run you a bath .
how do you feel ?
fine , thanks .
what' s up ?
something bothering you at work ?
no , not at all .
the job' s fine , the people are great .
it' s just a pity the programs you make are such garbage .
then don' t watch them .
who was the guy last night ?
oh , that' s takeda .
is he your boyfriend ?
no , he isn' t my boyfriend , thanks .
he helps me with my research .
well , i guess in that case , i should have been nicer to him .
you were fine , dad .
i' m the one who was out of order last night .
i' m sorry .
no , i' m sorry .
eleven people met their deaths yesterday at lake ikeda ... ... when their boat suddenly overturned .
their bodies were found this morning wrapped in a cocoon .
the young men and women were on a cycling trip from tokyo ... ... and were camped at lake ikeda ...
it' s lake ikeda .
southern kyushu , that' s strange .
that' s where takamori saigo was exiled over 100 years ago .
i wonder ...
is it coincidence ?
so some prediction says hundreds of people will die .
somewhere near mount fuji , right ?
you think we should publish it ?
but it isn' t just a prediction .
mount myoko , lake ikeda , all the places are in the book .
about last night , you still mad ?
look , i' m very sorry .
normally , i don' t drink .
look , there' s no need to apologize .
why should i be mad at you ?
he' s just embarrassed for leaving you behind .
yeah , it was my responsibility to see you home .
just count yourself lucky you didn' t .
i got the third degree .
it wasn' t so bad !
your dad sounded like a tough guy to me .
he' s tough , but he' s okay .
tell me , lieutenant , did you actually see it ?
yes .
and can you describe what you saw ?
yes , it was like the fin of a huge creature .
it' s believed godzilla fed off the energy radiated by the submarine .
yeah , but who can prove that it was godzilla ?
even if it was godzilla , it hasn' t been seen for 50 years .
why would it choose to come back here ?
it doesn' t make any sense .
why should it choose japan again ?
nobody can answer that question ... ... but we have to be ready for the worst scenario .
couldn' t he have picked on some other country ?
whenever we increase our defense spending ... ... we' re accused of depleting the government' s resources .
even if it does come back again ... ... our forces are now equipped with weapons that are far more advanced ... ... than anything we had before .
oh , yeah , sure .
he' s a well known character around these parts .
godzilla will return one day !
as if anyone gives a damn .
please .
it' s him .
you know him ?
i saw him at mount myoko .
mount myoko in niigata prefecture ?
must be a mistake .
he was caught destroying some old shrine , so we had to lock him up .
oh , by the way , have you visited our website yet ?
yes , it' s very interesting .
well , you see , i' m the webmaster .
godzilla will return .
we don' t have much time left .
go to the sacred place where the great ghidorah lies sleeping .
ghidorah ?
you must wake the thousand year old dragon ... ... before it' s too late .
and maybe together they can stop him .
baragon , mothra and ghidorah .
ghidorah was known as the eight headed dragon .
the men responsible for killing them called them the sacred monsters .
the people began to worship the beasts ' souls ... ... that were supposed to sleep for 10, 000 years .
despite having killed the monsters ... ... the ancient people still prayed for their souls .
do you think that ghidorah is alive ?
only 2000 years have gone by .
it' s much too early for that .
ghidorah still has some more growing to do .
once he is grown , he' il be strong .
yuri , what do you have there ?
i' m sure that old man must have put it here .
what makes you say it was him ?
just a hunch , it' s a feeling .
yeah !
when he made the gesture in the cell .
that' s right , i' m sure he meant this stone .
but i don' t understand it .
hey , look , it' s gone !
what ?
you see here ?
it' s disappeared !
the storm has worsened to a typhoon and is heading slowly northwards .
winds have reached force 10 to 11 in the bonin islands .
conditions are not likely to improve ... ... until tomorrow evening or thursday morning .
you won again !
this damn weather , it' s a real drag .
hey , where' s that ?
oh , the old lady here told me about those .
they' re pictures of the village where godzilla came ashore .
it must have been over 50 years ago .
yeah , but i thought that the army killed godzilla , right ?
sure , but it wasn' t that poor creature' s fault , right ?
how on earth could they do such a thing ?
godzilla would be great as a pet !
hey , that' s not an earthquake !
artillery shells can do nothing to stop it .
this animal has survived for eons .
atomic weapons and energy ... ... have given it extraordinary capacities for survival .
but it' s still an animal , and it can be defeated .
but i repeat , not with any weapons .
this animal represents the collective will to survive ... ... of many thousands of people .
collective will ?
this animal contains the restless souls of the countless people ... ... who perished during the terrible battles ... ... that took place during the pacific conflict .
their souls ?
in godzilla ?
say , yuri , do you really believe the old fart , huh ?
he' s not making it up , i know that .
the souls of all those people ...
everything he' s told us was written in his book .
you know , one of my wife' s relatives says she was trampled by godzilla .
really ?
that' s interesting .
they think i' m mad .
if you ask me , godzilla is old hat ...
never mind .
but tell me ...
just carry on with your project . ... why is godzilla attacking japan ?
why does it want to destroy us ?
because the japanese people want to forget what happened .
what ?
they have deemed it preferable to forget the pain and agony ... ... they inflicted on all those people !
we' re above magonot village now .
the place has been completely leveled .
it seems to have been due to a landslide .
can you see any survivors ?
we' il make another low pass and check .
hey !
that hill wasn' t there before !
what ?
that hill !
albatross !
what' s happening ?
my god !
it' s moving !
mayday !
albatross !
come in , please !
albatross !
hey !
come in !
the earth remembers , the stones remember .
if the earth and stones could only speak ... ... they would tell us many things .
it' s from a proverb from american indians .
stones can record history like a cd .
pressurized granite records geological information .
so rocks can yield up history , just like a cd can .
you follow me ?
if spirits are another form of electricity ... ... maybe there' s a way for them to be stored in stone .
could he have done that ?
and then he could have released all the souls ... ... and managed to find a way to channel the souls ... ... and somehow put them into the guardian monsters to wake them .
but why would he want to do it ?
to protect japan against godzilla !
monster !
from information contained in these reports by the defense agency ... ... we have now come to the conclusion that the monster ... ... that attacked the american submarine and a japanese island ... ... is likely to have been godzilla .
so the government has issued a security bulletin ... ... for all areas around the coast of japan .
godzilla !
godzilla' s coming !
he' s going to kill us all !
godzilla !
come on , father !
the least you could do is tell me !
what could i tell you ?
oh , come on !
i mean about godzilla , of course !
i' m a reporter !
then you should have other sources .
don' t rely on me .
look , i should tell you ... ... i have some important information for you .
starboard 15 .
half ahead .
clear forward deck !
report from the ako , southeast area clear .
it' s been three days already .
still no sign of godzilla , sir .
to be honest , some of the men don' t think godzilla exists .
so you see , baragon , mothra and ghidorah ... ... are there to protect us , the guardian monsters .
i don' t understand .
why attack us , then ?
well , what they' re defending is our homeland .
yes , that' s the difference , our homeland .
nothing to do with the nation .
the homeland means the mountains and rivers and forests and things .
and you really believe that rubbish ?
all i can say , father , is his story' s believable .
do you have a better story ?
but one thing i don' t understand ... ... is our soldiers died for their country .
so why do they now want to destroy japan ?
but so many other people suffered all over asia .
their spirits are overwhelmingly more numerous .
don' t you see ?
i' ve just returned from the bonins .
glad to see you , captain .
my daughter .
the island is a disaster zone .
i' m afraid the government has decided to cancel operations .
what ?
they' ve canceled everything ?
we' re to maintain our surveillance .
however , the minister doubts its existence .
these years of peace ... ... seem to have dimmed the memories of what happened .
but i haven' t forgotten those events , captain .
oh , no .
i remember perfectly .
fifty years ago , the sky was red ... ... buildings and railroads destroyed by godzilla .
a nightmare .
its huge and menacing figure slowly advancing .
i could see its head .
the head of a devil enraged with hate .
i ran .
i ran for my life ... ... trying to find a refuge , and when the terror ended ... ... my parents were gone .
gone forever .
i , for one , shall never forget those events .
the terrible screams of the people being trampled .
yes , send a report , urgently .
right , the epicenter .
readings show it' s moving underground !
nagano reports the epicenter moved underground .
epicenter still moving in a southward direction .
do you think we should issue another warning ?
it won' t make any difference , they' re not even ready to move yet .
better tell the commander .
i recorded it , my father' s story .
good idea .
i found it very moving , to be honest .
welcome !
i don' t think we should use it , do you ?
i recorded it for my own use .
i' m also his daughter , remember ?
then you should be able to convince him ... ... about the guardian monsters , shouldn' t you ?
yeah , well , dad' s also a navy commander .
it now appears that the earthquake in nagano prefecture is not over .
the epicenter seems to be moving ...
the epicenter' s moving !
i heard .
it was felt first in niigata and later on this afternoon in shizuoka .
the guardian monsters !
lf it' s niigata , it must be baragon .
niigata , ikeda and fuji .
according to this latest data ... ... as i understand it ... ... we have another monster , apart from godzilla , moving underground .
that' s impossible !
but we have proof .
this is definitely a living being .
yes , and even more incredible ... ... the locations concerned are exactly the locations ... ... that are mentioned in the legend .
you mean the guardian monsters , sir ?
you know about the ancient legend too , sir ?
it was a monster !
it was there in that cave , underground !
i tell you , it had a horrible head on it !
it' s going to come and get us !
well , if you' re sure about it , why not put it on your website ?
but i' m telling you , it' s true .
let me out !
it' s godzilla !
attention mobile units .
we have a report that the monster causing the tremors has surfaced .
what is it ?
the monster looks like godzilla !
godzilla !
the monster has come up .
it has what ?
a guardian monster or godzilla ?
the monster is at least 30 meters long .
it walks on all fours and has red skin .
it' s moving through gotenba near mount fuji .
a red monster ?
not godzilla ?
the information we' re receiving is still pretty confused .
but we do know that it' s not godzilla .
i think we should send in the fighter squadron based at the coast .
the anti godzilla plan ?
negative .
the latest reports coming in say the red godzilla is still on the move .
well , we' il soon be back in port .
hey , skip , red godzilla is at gotenba .
what do you mean ?
godzilla isn' t red !
it' s heading this way , skipper .
go on .
get the lines ready .
what' s going on ?
look , there !
it' s godzilla !
godzilla is at yaizu !
then what' s that at gotenba ?
all right , now , that' s enough !
we must wait for confirmation .
we searched everywhere for it , but we just couldn' t find it .
tell all army units to stand by .
godzilla has been confirmed at shimizu ... ... and is now reported to be heading northwards , sir !
all fighter units are on red alert .
ready to go , sir .
is there still time ?
minister !
we have to wait for the cabinet' s decision .
there' s a huge lizard outside !
evacuate the shop immediately !
get out of here !
evacuate ?
godzilla is just a legend .
godzilla .
children , we have to evacuate the school .
now clear your desks .
an atom bomb ?
yuri .
so you' re not afraid ?
no , i want to see it .
the guardian monsters might attack us .
have you thought of that ?
yuri ?
have you got the stone ?
in my bag .
you think it' s an amulet ?
godzilla has been heading towards the spa town of hakone .
a meeting of all cabinet ministers is now taking place ... ... to decide what measures should be taken for defense .
all defense personnel ...
follow the helicopter !
we' il never catch it in a car !
it' il lead us to godzilla , go on !
i' m sure it will !
that' s it !
what do you mean ?
i think i' ve found where that monster' s heading .
where ?
i think it' s heading towards godzilla .
godzilla ?
yes , sir , near hakone .
and at this rate , he' il be here tomorrow .
if we act immediately , we can place artillery at the sagami river .
but can we be sure he' s heading this way ?
i' m certain he is .
he' s heading right for tokyo .
like last time .
but why ?
why always here ?
baragon sighted , sir , at hakone .
have they managed to evacuate everybody yet ?
hey , look !
wow !
get a load of that monster !
it' s enormous !
but quite cute , really .
hey , quick , take a photo , and then we' il run !
i think the monsters are gonna fight .
you sure ?
look at that !
it' s gonna be some fight !
look , the whole thing is live on the television .
in fact , godzilla is much bigger than i thought he' d be .
idiots !
get out of our airspace !
the red monster has suddenly disappeared underground !
godzilla' s looking around .
he can' t understand where his enemy' s gone .
there are still hundreds of people in the area .
hey , where' s the helicopter ?
they' ve outsmarted us !
my god , it' s godzilla !
it really is enormous !
look , there' s our guardian monster .
our monster hasn' t got a chance !
godzilla' s kicking the red monster in the gravel pits !
the red monster is in big trouble !
it' s terrible , i don' t want to watch it !
shut up !
you' re here to film , right ?
so get filming !
quick , hurry up !
you' re missing it .
right .
we have a real grandstand view of the rumble here .
godzilla puts the boot in again , and the red monster seems down and out !
the red monster has climbed out of the gravel pits !
it' s trying to escape !
run !
he' s right behind you !
go on , get out of there !
hurry !
they' re dead .
the two men in the helicopter .
they' re dead .
yuri !
look !
yuri !
earlier today , godzilla landed at yaizu ... ... and caused extensive damage in the shimizu and fuji areas .
later , godzilla moved on to the hakone area ... ... where it battled another unknown creature .
residents have been asked to leave the area calmly ...
what' s up ?
you lost your parents ?
hey , miss , will we die ?
no , don' t worry .
everything' s gonna work out fine .
and there' s the guardian monsters .
they' re here to help us .
hey , do you work for digital q ?
yes , do you watch us ?
tell me , miss ... ... are monsters real ?
guardian monsters are , and they' re here to save us .
so don' t you worry .
everything' s gonna be fine .
out of the way , please !
just scratches .
i' il be fine .
glad to hear it .
can i have the car keys ?
no , you can' t .
gee , thanks .
look , haven' t you done enough , yuri ?
now , a huge cocoon like structure is floating on the lake .
many people have gathered at the water' s edge to see the sight .
the cocoon is the size of an ocean liner .
nobody has ever seen anything like it , and its origin remains a total mystery .
evacuate the area !
close all doors and windows ...
hello , i need a bicycle .
oh , well , i don' t have any with baskets left .
i sold out of them a couple of hours ago .
right , this one .
the invoice made out to bs digital .
bs ?
oh , bridgestone ?
gen. mikumo , you shall lead the counterattack , understood ?
thank you , sir .
i will not fail .
for security' s sake , this shall be the command center .
dispatch fighter units immediately !
yes , sir !
that lizard picked the wrong guy here .
please evacuate in an orderly manner .
do not use your personal vehicles .
please proceed to regrouping areas ... ... where you will be given transportation to leave the area .
only take essential belongings .
therefore , the government has decided ... ... to use the army to counter the threat our country is under today ... ... and the necessary measures are now in place .
our counterattack operations are under way tonight .
bs digital .
yuri , babe !
hey , where are you ?
i' ve got my camera with me .
i' m chasing godzilla .
sure , i' il send the pictures back over the net .
whatever you' ve got scheduled tonight , you better cancel it right now .
she' s always doing the opposite of what she should be doing !
what has gotten into her ?
we can' t cancel it !
why can' t we cancel ?
if the boss asks , i said it' s okay .
right , prepare to go live !
and i' il want an internet link too !
yuri , babe !
i want it straight from the lizard' s mouth , okay ?
hey , yuri !
take care !
okay .
missiles away !
this report comes to you from bs digital q tv ... ... bargain basement of the airwaves , and our star reporter ... ... on the scene near godzilla .
" bargain basement of the airwaves " ?
take it away , yuri !
it' s no good .
the missiles had no effect , sir .
try attacking it from the side .
it must have a weak point .
it' s not going to make any difference !
blue leader , come in !
contact lost ...
well , sir ?
we' re awaiting your next order .
hey , look !
what' s that ?
hurry !
let' s get out of here !
go back !
hurry !
well , minister ?
in the ' 50s , did we really get rid of godzilla ?
at the time , i doubted it ... ... but i taught my men to be proud of what they did .
i wonder , was it worth it ?
godzilla is now moving east !
he' s heading towards tokyo !
fifty years ago , the first godzilla attack was repulsed .
the animal was killed using an unknown chemical compound .
the inventor has since died and his records disappeared .
existing weapons were totally useless back then .
the defense forces could do nothing to stop godzilla .
so the government decided to keep what happened a secret .
if people knew the true story ... ... then our defense forces would have faced ridicule .
hence , the need for the utmost secrecy , understand ?
so i' m relying on your discretion .
cmdr. tachibana , do you have a daughter called yuri ?
yes , that' s right .
hundreds of people have been killed by godzilla .
burned to death or trampled underfoot by the monster .
but there is resistance .
not only from our defense forces , but also from other monsters .
they' re joining forces to stop godzilla .
stupid girl !
we' il try to protect her .
arrest her !
report from lake ikeda .
the cocoon has opened , sir !
what' s that ?
the thousand year old dragon ... ... ghidorah !
he wants to save us .
we' ve received news .
a new monster has been seen at mt .
fuji .
what the hell is going on ?
it' s like a monster convention here !
do we know where it is now ?
it' s heading east from mount fuji .
it' s flying straight towards godzilla .
radar confirms the heading .
what' s going to happen , commander ?
the guardian monsters are gathering .
they' re here to protect us from godzilla .
whatever happens , we must not attack the guardian monsters .
they are not our enemy .
why not name the monsters so we don' t get them mixed up , general ?
it would make things easier , sir .
well , it sounds a bit far fetched .
general .
i think i have an idea , general .
it seems several monsters are gathering in the area .
the red one will be code named baragon .
the flying insect , mothra ... ... and the golden monster code named ghidorah .
i repeat , the red one is baragon .
the flying insect is mothra .
the golden one is ghidorah .
capt. yamaguchi !
special intervention forces reporting for duty , sir !
we' il use the d3 warheads on all the missiles .
all right , captain , everybody to battle stations !
yes , sir !
remember to shut off all gas appliances .
leave your house lights on .
this will aid the military operation .
please evacuate in an orderly fashion .
proceed to regrouping areas and await transportation .
and good luck everybody !
yes , good luck everyone !
you' re going to die !
it seems so calm .
yet , soon it will be reduced to a blazing pile of rubble .
the first time i' ve seen action .
i' m not looking forward to it .
but it' s a soldier' s duty .
we can go into battle without relishing conflict .
godzilla' s here !
get those searchlights over here .
mothra !
man , that' s one hell of a bug .
hey !
look , there it goes !
it' s attacking godzilla !
yuri !
look out !
jesus , my buddies are in there !
what do we do ?
nothing we can do !
please , sir .
the men are still waiting for your orders !
hold fire .
patience .
ghidorah ?
the guardian monsters are here .
they' re all here .
proceed into the bay !
we' il press our attack from both land and the sea .
moving into the bay , sir !
we' d better make sure our timing' s right .
we won' t get a second chance .
we' il wait until godzilla has been wounded , then we' il attack !
hey , where are you going ?
you' re off limits here !
come back here !
hey , stop !
let go !
leave me alone !
you' re under arrest !
stop , let go of me !
stand by to commence attack !
all units ready to move !
all units , fire !
all units , fire !
all units , begin firing !
eighty percent destroyed !
no , 90 percent destroyed !
the aka , it' s exploded !
and we' re damaged too , sir !
i need a damage report !
right away , sir !
main guns destroyed , sir .
godzilla has seen us !
mothra !
thousand year old dragon , king ghidorah .
what the hell' s going on out there ?
godzilla and the other monster are fighting underwater .
godzilla seems to be wounded .
what i want to do is shoot a d3 into godzilla' s wound .
it might just work .
the launchers are damaged .
we can' t launch missiles !
i' il use the satsuma .
get one loaded onboard .
commander !
the satsuma is just a research vessel .
it' s not designed for war .
with a d3 loaded on it , it' s going to be very unstable .
we' il have to take that chance .
we don' t have any choice !
you' il need cover , sir !
any torpedoes left ?
a couple , sir .
then wish me luck .
good luck , sir .
the satsuma is attacking godzilla .
use all remaining firepower to cover the attack !
this has to succeed !
cmdr. tachibana is going to attack godzilla ... ... in a submersible using a d3 .
use all remaining firepower to cover the attack .
try to weaken godzilla as much as possible .
my father ?
the captain says you can' t stay here , miss .
can' t someone else go ?
why the commander ?
he' s a commander , a senior officer .
why does he have to go himself ?
because i have the most experience .
father ?
in these situations , a ship' s commander has to lead by example .
now get to the safety area and stay low .
i' ve got a job to do !
don' t you understand ?
sure , i understand .
but you' re my daughter .
is there a soldier there ?
pass him to me .
commander ?
soldier ... ... give the lady carte blanche .
but , sir !
i' il take responsibility .
sir .
you' re allowed to stay , miss .
thanks ... ... dad .
you be careful .
yes , i will .
promise you' il come back alive .
of course i will .
don' t worry .
i' il be fine .
stand by to launch submersible !
here , hold the camera .
what for ?
to film me !
right !
we' il find out if you' re our guardian , ghidorah .
commander , please come back safely .
the warriors have risen up to fight against godzilla ... ... with every weapon they can muster .
nobody knows if they' il succeed in their mission .
all i can do with my camera ... ... is to record their struggle ... ... to protect our freedom , regardless of danger ... ... so that our children ... ... will have a future .
yuri !

with any luck , the wound will still be warm .
switching to thermal imaging camera .
