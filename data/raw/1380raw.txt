maggie , may i be frank ?
only if you let me wear the hat .
ahem .
lowbrow remarks may work for you ... but we prefer the gentle approach .
well , she better stick a sock in it soon .
the vultures are starting to circle .

oh , that is a sensible idea .
i knew you' d love it !

oh , wake up and smell the alfalfa !
it' s perfect !
i' m gonna need a fresh horse .
hmm , a horse .
a horse .
let me think .
i reckon you' d want a fast horse , huh ?
real fast ?
course , he' d also have to be able to go ... for days without food or drink ... stealthy , sure footed in any terrain ... well , huh ...
look at me !
what about that horse ?
what , you mean buck here ?
eee !

look , all we' ve got to do ... is follow this chuck wagon to a cattle drive .
ahh .
and then , you see ... we let the bad guys come to us .
oh !
we' ve no reason to believe ... this chuck wagon is heading off to a cattle drive .
hey , tommy !

all right , what part of " cover me " didn' t we understand ?
you guys ok ?
i don' t know .
i feel like i was dreaming .
yeah .
slim started singing ... and all of a sudden i lost track of everything .
singing ?
that didn' t sound like singing to me .
and , you know , i have perfect pitch .
uh , yes .
grace , about your perfect pitch ...
not now , maggie .
all right , show' s over !
oh , no .
you' re interfering with official police bidness !
ha .
be right with you , big guy .
buck is on the case .
you know .
whoo !
don' t embarrass me in front of my partner .
please !
you and he are partners ?
so , how does that work exactly ?
i mean , do you get to ride him on odd days or even ?
hey !
he chose me specifically ... because i have skills that are essential ... to capturing our quarry .
huh ?
ha ha ha !
whoo !
smush !
oof !
you boys headed back to town ?
yes , sir .
we got to go file a report with the sheriff .
give him back his horse .
this one' s too skittish around cows .
and that , girls , is what makes me and rico ... equal parts of one lean mean crime fighting ...
machine ?
well , there it is , then .
well , well , well , stud .
now , i' m no professional ... but i' d say the only mano a mano you' il be doing ... is in your dreams .
oh , look out , buck .
he' s making a move on your left flank .
kaboosh !
maggie !
grace !
leave that poor animal alone .
buck , i realize you' re very upset ... but if you' d like to join our group ... and help us bring in slim , we' d be happy to have you .
however , there are a few ... anger management issues we need to discuss .
i wouldn' t help you bossy bovines ... if my life depended on it !
you see , that' s just what i' m talking about .
grace !
bye .
come on , girls .
hmm .
let' s go get slim .
come on , girls , let' s go get slim .
cud chewing heifers .
huh .
i can catch that slim with one hoof tied behind my back .
wait a minute .
why don' t i ?
yes !
partner or no partner , that' s what i' m a do .
hey !

it' s hero time !
watch out now !
hey !

kiss myself !
whoo !
da da yoo
oh , this is a fine kettle of fish .
how can we compete with that ?
look at the bright side , mrs. c.
don' t forget about our secret weapon .
secret weapon ?
who better to catch a cattle thief than a cow ?
yeah , even you can' t argue with that kind of logic .
ok , maybe you can .
you know , grace ...
maggie does so love your singing .
how about a song ?
i' m gonna get you for this .
ha ha !
5, 000 texas longhorns .
not bad for one night' s work .
pick a color .
i said , not bad for one night' s work .
what ?
thank you .
and judging by the ear mark ...
i' d say these are the last of big mike donald' s herd .
big mike donald had a farm ?
e l e i ...
e l e i ...
ohh ...
ohh ...
that' s right .
he had a farm .
heh heh heh .
now that all his cash cows have disappeared ... that poor sap' s gonna be flat broke .
perfect time for a certain upstanding land owner ... to step in and take all the land .
aah !
who are you ?
what did you do with uncle slim ?
put up your dukes , mr. fancy britches .
aah aah aah aah aah aah !
it' s me .
hello ?
this here is the disguise i use ... to sneak into all them auctions ... and buy all the land , you brainless monotone monkeys .
shoot , you got to be the richest land baron in the west .
yes , but the part that really warms my heart ... is watching those homesteaders suffer .
back in the day , i worked ... the highfalutinest ranches you ever seen ... but those stuck up ranch bosses couldn' t appreciate my talents .
maybe they just didn' t like your singing .
my singing ?
songbirds sing .
saloon gals sing .
little bitty snot nosed children sing .
i yodel !
and yodeling is an art !
well , maybe they just didn' t like your yodeling .
he didn' t mean it , uncle slim .
everybody likes yodeling .
hmm ?
why , it' s one of the funniest , cornball , goofy , silly sounds ... in the whole west .
yaah !
aah !
yaah !
uh , gil ?
uh huh ?
am i correct in assuming that each and every time ... we brought a herd back to this secret lair ... you' ve managed to sit in the exact same spot ... blocking that choice piece of property from my view ? !
this is my comfy place .
what ?
aah !
it' s called patch of heaven , uncle slim .
goes on auction thursday morning .
perfect .
pencil it in .
thursday morning ... right after we sell off this herd .
but it' s just a little old dirt farm .
ah , what' s the difference ?
when you' re talking revenge , every last acre counts .
i don' t get it .
weren' t the cows supposed to come back ?
daddy , what' s going to happen if they don' t come back ?
oh , but they are coming back .
hogwash !
we all know they' re never coming back .
what ?
ooh !
ooh !
you don' t know that , jeb .
everybody knows that bovines ... are the most intelligent , crafty animals in the west .
yeah .
he' s right , you know .
it doesn' t take a cow to figure out ... they saw the writing on the wall ... and flown the coop while the getting was good .
what ?
oh , no !
they tricked us and deserted us !
no , no .
aud audrey .
excuse me .
excuse me .
excuse me !
oh , uh , let' s not forget who we' re talkin ' ' bout .
audrey , remember when grace helped you figure out ... why you crossed the road ?
and , jeb , miss caloway knew just what to do ... when your head got stuck in that spittoon .
get off my case !
and maggie was gonna make us all winners .
i truly believe there ain' t nothin ' ... those three cows can' t do .
aw ...
well , whatever they' re gonna do , they better do it soon .
i' m so very sorry , pearl .
it' s a real shame .
it is .
ollie , i don' t know what' s worse ...
losing my farm to the highest bidder ... or knowing that ... that my girls are lost and alone out there .
yee haw !
come on , girls .
either i' m getting good at this ... or his scent is getting stronger .
go get him , maggie .
look out , slim !
no .
it can' t be .
we' re on your trail !
hmm .
hoo hoo !
oops .
this has buck written all over it .
we' re not gonna let this dumb old trick stop us .
sooner or later , all these paths will hook up , and then ...
oh , no , the tracks !
hurry up , girls .
don' t lose that trail .
what trail ?
i can' t see anything .
look out !
oh !
flash flood !
get to high ground !
oh .
maggie !
oh !
maggie !
no !
come on , girls , we can' t give up !
maggie , that' s enough .
the minute this lets up ... we' re heading straight home to patch of heaven .
but what about catching slim and collecting the reward ?
we never had a prayer ... of catching slim in the first place .
this whole ridiculous plan ... is just so you can get revenge on those cattle rustlers .
hey !
for your information , duchess ... this whole ridiculous plan is about us saving our farm .
huh .
our farm might' ve had a fighting chance ... until you came along .
what' s that supposed to mean ?
strutting around with your vulgar show cow behavior .
look , i was just having ... wasting our time on your foolish plans .
through the years , patch of heaven ... has survived every hardship that nature can dish out ... but you , maggie ... are the biggest catastrophe to ever hit our farm .
well , if that' s the way you feel about it ... maybe we should just go our separate ways .
now , that' s the first good idea you' ve ever had .
fine !
fine !
fine !
fine !
yeah .
fine .
it' s not like your farm ... was ever gonna feel like home to me anyways .
rain is pourin ' down like the heavens are hurtin ' seems like it' s been dark since the devil knows when how do you go on never knowing for certain will the sun ever shine again ?
feels like it' s been years since it started to thunder clouds are campin ' out in the valley and glen how do you go on when you can' t help but wonder will the sun ever shine again ?
what if the rain keeps fallin ' ?
what if the sky stays gray ?
what if the winds keep squallin ' and never go away ?
maybe soon the storm will be tired of blowin ' maybe soon it all will be over , amen how do you go on if there' s no way of knowin ' ?
will the sun ever shine ?
wish i could say
send me a sign one little ray lord , if you' re listenin ' how long until then ?
will the sun ever shine again ?
mmm ...
mmm ...
maggie .
maggie .
maggie .
wake up .
check , please !
it tasted a lot better in my sleep .
well , i suppose you' il be off now .
mm hmm .
where will you go ?
oh , probably check out the grand canyon .
see utah before i die .
wait a minute .
where' s grace ?
hi , there .
boy , am i glad you guys are up .
hey , come look at this .
what on earth ?
where did all this come from ?
hey , it' s green , it' s leafy , and it' s free .
shut up and eat .
good morning , ladies .
i see you' re already tucked into your appetizer .
never knew a pretty lady that didn' t have an appetite .
oh , now , see here , you ruffian ...
he' s not a ruffian , mrs. caloway .
he' s a genuine desert shaman ... our very own wise man .
shaman , chef , chief cook , and bottle washer .
i' m a jackrabbit of all trades and at your service .
folks around these parts call me lucky jack .
yep , they used to come from miles around ... just to get one rub of my lucky rabbit' s foot .
whoo !
dagnabit !
this happens all the time .
now , where was i ?
ah .
voila .
now let me just get this on the fire ... and it' il be ready directly .
mm huh .
ow !
yow !
look , we don' t eat meat .
it' s kind of like a professional courtesy .
perhaps we' il dine with you some other time .
you see , grace and i are returning to our farm ... to say our last good byes .
yeah .
we need closure .
well , i can sympathize there , sister , i truly can .
until recently , i , too , had a home .
echo mine it was called .
us jackrabbits lived there for generation after generation .
till some land grabbing bandit moved in ... and flushed us out like yesterday' s oatmeal .
ahem .
excuse us .
my good fellow , we must be on our way .
wait !
there he is !
aah !
slim !
you mean this no good varmint ... is hiding out in echo mine right now ?
without a doubt .
maggie , what are you thinking ?
look , i got a score to settle with that rhinestone fat boy ... and nothing to lose .
but it' il be dangerous going after slim all by yourself .
hey , i got the rabbit .
that' s not all you got , maggie .
you got us .
oh , no .
no , no , no .
no .
we are sticking to our plan and going home .
hold on , you two .
as strange as this sounds , grace is actually making sense .
thank you .
you want the money ... and i want to get even with slim .
the three of us go together , and we' re sure to get him .
once you collect the reward , i' il walk out your front gate ... and i' il stay out of it forever .
deal ?
your powers of persuasion are uncanny .
deal .
ha !

rico .
you' re too kind , boss .
no , it can' t be .
his reputation as a bounty hunter is well known ... but lately he' s been doing a little moonlighting ... and covering my tracks .
rico' s going to see you to the border ... so that nothing else goes wrong .
tck tck .
now , if you' il all pardon me ... there' s a little patch of heaven ... on the auction block this morning .
he' s going to buy our farm !

i' il tell you how !
the same way we walked off the farm into the unknown .
the same way we fought off those burly barmaids .
and the same way we braved the western wilderness ... without the benefit of food or water .
we caught slim once , and we shall do it again !
who' s with me ?
