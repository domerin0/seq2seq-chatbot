good evening , ladies and gentlemen .
and welcome to our little show .
tonight , we got ourselves ... ... a bona fide multiplicitous ... ... conglomeration of cubanos ... ... on this here stage tonight .
we got ... ... paquito d' rivera !
we got ignacio berroa !
and ... ... we got my newest ... ... cuban son ... ... arturo sandoval .
here by special permission of the cuban government .
i' d like to say something .
ever since i was a little boy and ... ... since the first time i heard his music ... ... i had a dream to be able to play with maestro dizzy gillespie .
so , to me right now , life is truly a dream .
mari , it' s me , arturo .
arturo , where are you ?
i' m in athens .
are you okay ?
yes .
you' re in london , this is it .
we' re halfway there .
it' s all arranged .
tonight ?
i will be in italy tomorrow .
be careful .
i' il call you when i get there .
tell ' em none of that feta cheese .
got that ?
un feta .
you got it .
don' t go away .
arturo , what' s going on ?
quick , give me a cigarette .
my wife and son are in london .
they' re where ?
we' re not going back .
it' s not done yet .
it' s okay .
don' t worry .
we' il get you out .
arturo , man , let' s go .
i called the embassy .
they' re expecting us .
what' s the matter ?
i still got family there , diz .
when you leave , the government punishes those you leave behind and love .
then are you sure you want to do this ?
i' ve been in jail all my life .
freedom' s a scary thing , but ... ... i gotta get on the bird .
well , come on , let' s do it .
the embassy' s closed , sir .
you better get it open .
this is an international incident .
my cuban friend
sir , the embassy' s closed .
not for me .
i' m dizzy gillespie .
open the gate , sergeant .
yes , sir .
it' s an honor to meet you , we got your call .
you must be arturo sandoval .
that' s the second greatest trumpet player in the world .
someone should be ....
there you are .
good evening , gentlemen .
i should say , good morning .
i' m michael tasker .
i' m a big fan , mr. gillespie .
thank you .
this is arturo
arturo sandoval , yes , petition for asylum .
how long' s this gonna take ?
red tape respects no boundaries .
that' s an international fact of life .
if you' d like to  this is the american embassy .
i know you got some apple pie around here .
i think we can arrange something .
you be cool .
thank you , diz .
enjoy .
right this way .
your mr. gillespie is one of the few people ... ... who can open this place in the middle of the night .
have a seat and i' il be back in a moment .
thank you .
coffee ?
thank you , yes .
i' m scared .
trust me .
i think i should explain ... ... there are certain criteria that must be met before we can grant asylum .
an individual must prove that he is unable to return ... ... to his homeland for fear of persecution .
i understand .
that' s why i' m here .
you' ve been touring with mr. gillespie' s united nation band .
are you here with your family ?
no .
my wife and son are waiting for me in london .
you' re seeking asylum for them as well ?
yes .
is there a problem ?
i just need some information .
okay .
so , you' ve been a musician for how many years ?
since i was six years old .
i taught my cat how to walk on a tight rope while i played the bongos .
it was like an animal act .
and you were educated at a government run music school ?
yes .
you were classically trained ?
yes .
it says you were a member of the cuban music academy .
is that right ?
yes .
is that a state sponsored organization ?
yes .
your first professional job ....
what is that ?
orquesta
cuban modern music orchestra .
government sponsored ?
yes , of course .
if the government doesn' t sponsor it , it doesn' t exist .
maybe i' m missing something here , because it seems that on paper ... ... that the government treated you quite well .
they supported you as a musician .
yes .
yes , as long as i did what they wanted .
that' s the shit !
that' s what we should be playing .
i know !
start a band and get on the bird and fly !
you haven' t changed .
what for ?
you look good , very handsome .
even without the hair , very handsome .
what' s this about ?
nothing .
come on in , guys .
relax , please , sit down .
here , don' t burn my couch .
jaime , why are we here ?
what is this meeting about ?
compaero somavilla brought a matter to my attention .
i just mentioned to jaime , that ... ... you want to start your own band .
you' re own band .
it' s a good idea .
it' s a shame we just can' t do it .
caballeros .
i' m an artist just like you are .
i understand the need to invoke the muse .
but as cubans , we have to present a united front .
politically and musically .
destroying the orquesta is not in our interests
no .
we do not want to destroy anything .
just the best band in cuba , that' s all .
there' s room for another great band in cuba .
normally i' d agree with you but we' re living in times of scarcity now .
exactly .
besides ....
i just can' t see why you can' t play what you want in the orquesta .
in the orquesta , we play what you want us to play .
we need to experiment .
you don' t want to experiment .
you just don' t want to play our music .
you want to play their music .
the music of the enemy .
what is the music of the enemy ?
that' s enough !
our comrades are losing their lives in angola .
you guys are thinking about your little music .
just about yourselves !
there' s no time for that .
there are limits !
there are limits !
leave the cowboys alone .
i never saw that picture before .
i don' t care , this is dominoes .
pay attention to the game !
one more coffee , please .
wait , it' s not your turn .
gracias , mama .
your coffee is like a wake up kiss in the morning .
cirita bonita , tan bella y sabrosita .
gracias .
tastes like the fourth time through on these grounds .
you boys wanna play ?
maybe later , papi .
this is going nowhere .
you heard jaime ?
they pull us out of venues .
they pull the equipment .
they won' t ever do it .
we' il be so good they' il have to support us .
how are you gonna get ' em to support a jazz band ?
never call it " jazz .
don' t ever even use the word .
they' il know .
they' il hear it .
these guys , they' re not musicians , they' re bureaucrats .
you' re cuban , i' m cuban .
chucho' s cuban .
whatever we play is gonna be cuban music .
we' il need some kind of camouflage , you know ?
congas .
big ones .
up front .
up front !
we called ourselves " irakere .
it' s an african word meaning , " jungle .
we played jazz ... ... but we gave it our own swing .
wait a minute , excuse me .
they didn' t stop you .
and this band was a success .
yes .
the camouflage we had worked .
you toured extensively .
you did a record for cbs .
you even won a grammy .
it seems like the government didn' t care what you were playing .
they chose not to notice because we were making a lot of money for them .
i imagine you were making some money for yourself as well ?
it doesn' t work that way .
the clubs pay the ministry of culture directly .
all we got was meal money .
you know you can make a lot more money if you weren' t in cuba .
it' s not about the money .
it' s about the music .
they let you play the kind of music that you wanted .
american jazz and gershwin and ellington
you' re always taking a risk because in cuba you never know where the line is .
you can play gershwin once too often .
not being able to play gershwin does not constitute persecution .
it is if they decide it' s counter revolutionary and you' re put in jail .
in cuba you live with that fear every day .
someone might come to you , your house , your family ... ... and hurt you because of a song .
just a song .
and that is persecution .
if you felt that strongly about it ... ... why didn' t you defect earlier ?
i was about to .
i had it all planned out .
but you stayed .
let' s go !
life has it' s own plan .
let' s go !
c' mon !
c' mon , let' s go !
i' m here , let' s go .
the bus is coming !
c' mon , what are you waiting for ?
if you don' t get this one , there won' t be another bus for hours !
i' m with him .
c' mon !
i' ve been here all along , right here .
she' s with me .
she' s the love of my life .
by the way , what' s your name ?
marianela marianela
marianela
when she walks
all the buses have to stop
and when she laughs
she has to cry
what' s wrong ?
my mother just died ... ... a week ago .
i' m sorry .
did your mother have something against laughing ?
where are you going ?
this is my stop .
really ?
mine , too .
what a coincidence .
i wanna see you before i go .
what' s the point if you are leaving ?
why does there have to be a point ?
when does your tour finish ?
in a month .
let' s have dinner .
ask me when you get back .
that' s too long , i need to see you before i go .
what' s the hurry ?
i' m afraid you might forget me .
that' s very unlikely .
cuban mlnistry of commerce
excuse me , do you work here at the foreign trade ministry ?

i don' t think so .
is there a problem ?
no problem .

the whole family ?
yes .
the whole family , even the dog .
the dog ?
good thing she escaped .
she didn' t escape .

she gave up because things got a little tough .
she wanted to go shopping in miami .

i like to come here ' cause the music ....
my playing comes back to me like a wave .

marianela .
really .
put your hand on my heart .
right here .
nice .
nice .

marianela .
where does she live ?

i think you' re in love and that' s a dangerous place to be .
what are you talking about ?

what do you think ?
it' s worse than i thought .
be careful .
you know how it works .
they get a spy to dress up like the woman of your dreams .
it must be quite a temptation for you .

traveling to all those countries .
nice cars , nice clothes .
do you ever want to get off the plane and not come back ?
you know , arturo ... ... you' d miss cuba .
you' d miss the way everything smells like sugar .
you' d miss the baseball .
you' d miss our music .
i' m still sitting here .
i don' t understand why people leave cuba .
especially you , who' s gotten so many things from the revolution .
marianela .
my talent comes from god , not fidel .
do i have " defector " written on my forehead ?
what are we talking about here ?
do you get this nervous on stage ?
only at auditions .
how am i doing ?
i' m still sitting here .
wait !
wait !
this is marianela !
when she walks , all the buses have to stop !
that was the last bus .
that was the only bus .
okay .
what are you gonna do ?
i don' t know .
i could stay at my friend' s apartment .
i should call home .

you' re welcome .
goodnight .
i' il walk you there .
come on .
no , it' s okay
it' s okay ?
okay then , let' s go .

because ... ... i' m afraid i might fall in love with you .
it would never work .
we are too different .

you' re not supposed to listen to that station .
now we' re safe .
it' s not funny .

i spent four months in military jail for listening to that .
i think i earned the right .
time to go .

she sees things completely differently now .
that' s convenient , now that you' re seeking asylum .
convenient .
it seems that her politics didn' t bother you .
i never said that .
we had many disagreements about politics .
you had disagreements ?
you claim to be on opposite ends of the political spectrum .

different way of thinking .
i don' t understand you and neither will anybody else .

somebody' s following me .
what ?
somebody' s following me .
he was not supposed to be following you .
wait ....
you know him ?
he' s a friend of emilia' s .
he was only supposed to ask around .
he' s been looking for things .
what ?
about you .
about me ?
why ?
because i asked him to .
you asked him ?
yes .
if you want to know something about me , why don' t you ask me ?
because i don' t know if i can trust you .
you don' t trust me ?
i' ve told you everything .
that' s not true .
you never told me about alba marina .
i told you i was married !
not to alba marina .
what difference does it make ?
do you have any doubts that i love you ?
listen , arturo .
i had one husband walk out on me .
he walked out on you and your son .
yes , and i won' t go through that again !
don' t compare me to him !

welcome to the beautiful havana .
mr. gillespie , first thing we' re gonna do , we' re gonna tour ... ... one of our internationally renowned health care facilities .
thank you , but my health don' t need caring .
can you take me to chano pozo' s crib ?
chano pozo' s crib ?
you don' t know who chano is ?
i know who chano is !
this has nothing to do with you .
no , hold on a second .
can you take me to his crib ?
his crib ?
yes , of course .
mr. gillespie , we have a tour .
we have the entire day planned out for you .

mr. gillespie , luciano pozo y gonzlez .
better known as " chano .
cuban conga player you met in 1946 .
chano' s from belen , which is just up the street here .
dizzy gillespie and chano pozo added a whole new polyrhythmic structure to jazz .
you read the liner notes .
i' ve read everything to be read about  i gotta tell you something .
your car smells funny .
gasoline .
gasoline and tar .
i painted it with gasoline and tar .
gasoline and tar ?
you' re supposed to put the car on the road , not the road on the car .
understand what i' m saying ?
anti imperialists
revolutlon
is there a statue or something ?
statue ?
no , there' s no statue , diz .
then take me to chano pozo street .
street ?
no , there' s no street .
what do they got ?
they don' t got anything .
how do people remember him ?
most people don' t remember him .
that' s criminal , man .
one of the greatest players that ever played .
chano pozo transcended the vicissitudes of the contingent world ... ... and moved in an odyssey into the realm of the metaphysical .
i' il betcha karl marx got himself a statue .
a statue and a theater , too .
karl marx can kiss chano pozo' s ass .
you hear it ?
that' s the sound , diz .
chano pozo learned how to play the conga right in this neighborhood .
what' s this , a show or something ?
it' s actually a party .
it' s here every afternoon .
we' il stop here .
you can shoot as much as you want .
this is chano' s world .
this is the real thing .
they' re doing a traditional yamboo .
dedicated to the city of belen , where chano' s from .
you all kept it alive , man .
when they dragged us over to america , they took our drums ... ... our religion , our language .
we had to learn theirs .
but the true african heart' s still beating here in cuba .
i mean it is what it was .
there' s more .
a lot more .
that reminds me , they' re putting together some sort of jam session for me tonight .
you ever heard of this band called irakere ?
irakere ?
i heard of ' em .
you' re about to hear the best musicians in cuba .
like , paquito d' rivera .
i like the sound of that .
gracias .
what the hell' s my driver doing playing a trumpet ?
your driver ?
gimme my horn .
the african and the cuban ... ... transmogrified on the great ethereal plane .
i smuggled this thing in from frankfurt .
the government here , they don' t support jazz .
as soon as you get on that boat tomorrow , the so called " jazz festival " is over .
musica non grata .
musica non grata .
that show tonight was just for you .
it' s not like that every day .
this your stuff ?
i didn' t hear any of this tonight .
just some stuff i' m working on .
that' s nice .
musica non grata .
you know ... ... miles davis came to me for a trumpet lesson once .
i said , " let' s go to the piano .
i don' t play no piano .
i told him , " the only way you can really get inside the music ...
... arranging , composition , is with the piano .
you learn it , then we can better understand each other .
why don' t you come on tour with me ?
me , come with you ?
that horn i heard tonight doesn' t belong to you .
it belongs to the whole world .
boat leaves maana .
tomorrow ?
i wish , diz .
i wish .
you don' t understand .
dizzy gillespie saw something in me .
in me .
so now you want to go away with him ?
i don' t know what you want anymore .
you are already in a band .
you tour , you' re famous .
i' m on display .
i am in a cage .
don' t be ridiculous .
i' m in a sanctioned band , playing sanctioned songs .
we' re going on tour next week and i don' t even feel like going .
the music that i played tonight , that' s what i need to be playing .
don' t you want that ?
of course i do .
you know that i' ve always supported you .
we' re a family .
there are limits .
limits ?
who am i talking to here ?
i don' t see why you have to complicate things .
look at this .
ten thousand cubans have stormed into the peruvian embassy ... ... in a desperate attempt to flee the island .
the castro regime is waging a crackdown on descent after a chaotic 48 hours ... ... that began when a havana bus driver seeking asylum ... ... for himself and his passengers , crashed through the embassy gates ... ... prompting a cross fire that left one guard dead .
in retaliation for the embassy' s refusal to turn over the gate crashers ... ... the cuban government removed its guard ... ... triggering a stampede of refuge seeking cubans .
i left my sax on the plane .
you forgot your sax ?
watch this for me , okay ?
okay .
hurry up , the plane' s gonna leave soon .
why did we cancel the tour ?
we canceled the tour to protect irakere' s reputation and yours .
this is osvaldo , our compaero from state security who attends to us .
i' il call you later .
sit down .
as i was saying , irakere is a very important voice of this revolution .
so is your voice .
and so was paquito' s .
and he betrayed us .
and now , with paquito gone ... ... we think you should play a more prominent role in irakere .
you know i appreciate that , jaime , but ... ... i got some other plans .
you got some other plans ?
i want to start my own band .
i want to do some fusion , i want to expand the whole concept of cuban music .
i want to bring it to a new international level .
your own band ?
yes , my own band .
all right everybody ready at 5 : 00 for sound check .
it' s out of my hands .
you can' t play here .
i have been to every club in this town .
i cannot get a gig .
word on the inside is you' re on the outside , that' s what they say .
angel , this is your club , your rules .
you love this music , but what ?
i' m your friend .
it would make things a lot easier if you just joined the party .
very simple .
what ?
listen !
you don' t have to believe it , just sign .
no .
you wanna play the horn , right ?
you gotta play the game !
partner , you watching ?
go sit down and play with your father .
i can' t .
i gotta go .
why can' t you stay longer ?
marianela , let' s go .
vmonos .
you never want to play .
he never wants to play .
come on , play .
sit down , you got time .
maybe you win .
marianela , let' s go !
i' m coming !
weren' t you a friend of paquito d' rivera ?
i' m still a friend .
really ?
even after he defected ?
paquito turned his back on our country .
to me , he' s a traitor .
he made a choice .
he turned his back and he had it all .
if he had it all , he wouldn' t have left .
he' s just another worm .
a worm ?
just like the 100, 000 that are leaving from the port of mariel by boats ?
i guess they got tired of having it all , too .
how can you say that ?
are you listening to your son ?
i think we should play .
it' s my turn .
marianela , let' s go !
talk to me .
you lose your temper every time we go there .
you can' t even sit down and play dominoes with your father .
' cause i can' t watch it anymore .
he likes to play .
what' s wrong with that ?
he' s throwing his life away .
my father used to be a great mechanic , and they came and took his garage away !
why do you think i bought that car ?
i bought it for him , to get him away from that goddamn table !
keep your voice down .
what are you afraid of ?
the revolution ?
remember , it gives us everything .
they didn' t take your father' s garage .
he gave it up .
they nationalized it !
they took away what he believed in !
they took away his dream , his love , his trade !
the thing that he did !
we all make sacrifices .
for what ?
for what ?
for the country !
for an idea !
free hospitals , free education .
of course .
and by the way , those 100, 000 people running away at mariel , they are giving up .
giving up ?
yes !
that is exactly what they are not doing !
by the way , what good is free education if you can' t read and say what you want ?
what good are eyes if everybody' s blind ?
i' ve never heard your father complain !
not to you .
or you .
your father supports this revolution .
because that' s all he' s got left !
if he denounces it now , what does he have ?
if he denounces fidel , his entire life would be meaningless !
he would have given up everything for a fucking lie !
turi is sleeping !
the whole neighborhood is sleeping !
the whole country is sleeping !
my kids will have to wake up !
my kids will not sleep through this !
let' s go , wake up , right now !
they can hear you down the street .
let ' em report me to the committee of the defense of the revolution !
the sandoval family will not sleep through this !
are you listening ?
let' s go , time to wake up !
nobody' s sleeping in here !
let' s go !
you gonna sleep all day ?
what do you want ?
you can play .
business has been bad , and you bring in the customers , so
how many nights ?
we' il see how it goes .
one , two .
one , two , three , four .
okay ?
like that .
one , two .
one , two , three , four .
what' s the matter , you forget how to play the trumpet ?
no !
johnny !
what happened ?
they kick both of you out of london ?
hello , darling .
good to see you .
you couldn' t come to our club , so we came to you .
we had dizzy back at the club last week .
he couldn' t stop talking about ... ... his cuban compadre .
he' s an honorary cuban now .
he has a special respect for you .
and he agrees with me .
you gotta be somewhere where your talents are truly respected .
not so loud .
i just want to hear the end of it .
turi , off to bed .
it' s late .
s .
you should see this on ochoa .
come .
this is general ochoa .
led the troops in angola , fidel proclaimed him the hero of the revolution .
now he has him on trial .
what' s his crime ?
he got too popular .
you see , in cuba there could only be one hero of the revolution .
unless , you' re dead and then you can be as popular as you want .
don' t let arturo brainwash you .
ochoa is only accused of drug trafficking .
mari' s the only person in the country who believes he did it without fidel' s blessing .
i don' t even think he did it and i' m not the only one .
we have a judicial process here .
he will be exonerated .
exonerated ?
it' s a fair trial .
you' ve been watching this trial for a week and it' s not a fair trial , it' s a farce !
he will end up in the firing squad .
he will never execute ochoa .
it' s already been fixed .
his lawyer has begged the judge to execute him .
his defense attorney has turned into his prosecutor .
you call that a fair trial ?
i' m so sorry .
i just wanted tonight to be perfect .
darling .
i' ve never had a dinner party without a fight .
usually , i' m the one who starts them .
i don' t know what he wants .
he' s so ... ... unhappy .
of course he is , he' s a musician .
i' ve been around them for 40 years .
you know , in all that time i' ve never seen another one like arturo .
i' d like to dedicate this show tonight to my main man ... ... my inspiration , mr. dizzy gillespie .
i' d like to play a tune entitled , blues for diz .
sorry , i' m late .
this is paloma .
i' m glad you could come .
i wouldn' t miss it .
johnny and sally , our friends from london .
mari , you have to know something .
people are watching .
there have been reports about him , about both of you .
what are you talking about ?
they' re gonna shut him down .
they won' t let him play after tonight .
great show .
you know that if it was up to me , you could play here every night .
you know that .
you were wonderful .
wait .
why do you think the cuban government is so afraid of your music ?
they' re not afraid of my music , they' re afraid of ideas .
come on , fidel castro is afraid of your ideas ?
fidel castro is afraid of any idea that' s not his .
you know how he overthrew batista ?
it was a popular revolution .
it was a popular idea , it was a great idea .
restoration of a constitution , democracy , freedom from a dictatorship .
he did it with 80 people and 50 guns .
and a boat that nearly sank because of a running toilet .
that can' t be all they had .
that' s all he needed because the idea gave him the strength of an army .
the reason i' ve come here is to see if maybe i could talk about arturo .
so he could be allowed to play his music .
it' s not entirely an issue of music .
i' m sorry ?
and it isn' t entirely about arturo .
you were also seen entertaining foreigners in your home .
are you questioning my loyalty ?
there is a pattern of counter revolutionary behavior .
with all due respect , what revolution are you talking about ?
is there some confusion ?
apparently .
my revolution doesn' t sound anything like your revolution .
mine is not about informing on your neighbors .
it' s about creating a new society .
genuine equality , remember ?
a place where our children can thrive .
i' m sure you will agree that no country loves its children more than cuba .
until they grow up .
compaera .
i know you love your husband , but don' t say something you may regret later .
the revolution needs everyone' s support to survive .
excuse me for saying this ... ... but if the revolution can' t survive ... ... two people from england having dinner at my house ... ... or a cuban man playing the music he loves ... ... why bother trying to save it ?
they' re showing this all day long .
what' s the verdict ?
what do you think ?
he already shot him .
where did he go ?
at any cost
were you there that day when fidel marched into havana ?
i was there .
i was a child .
and i saw him riding in that jeep .
that beard , that smile .
he was like a saint .
and i fell in love .
i fell in love with fidel , i fell in love with his dream .
it was going to be paradise .
i didn' t know .
i didn' t know they would stop you from playing your music .
my wife got her heart broken .
it' s like finding out that your lover had been cheating on you all this time .
and it was over for her .
just so i understand ... ... what you' re saying is you never sympathized with the castro regime .
please , i mean no disrespect , take a piece of pencil and write this down .
i have never ever , sympathized with fidel castro .
he betrayed the idea , he broke every promise he ever made .
please , just write that down .
this is from the london tlmes earlier this year .
you' re quoted as making favorable statements about the castro regime .
this is from a german newspaper , frankfurt , i think .
the revolution gave me everything i needed .
is that an accurate quote ?
i said it in frankfurt , in stockholm and in havana .
i had to say what i had to say .
i had to play the game .
you have to understand how that looks .
you come in here with an american icon
everyone in havana , every single person in havana ... ... has to have a double face in order to survive !
you must understand , you have to play the game .
i plead with you .
my wife and my son are waiting for me .
my son is in london waiting for me !
this was intercepted by the u. s. interest section in havana six months ago .
it confirms your membership in the communist party ... ... and your acceptance of all its principles .
are you a member ?
are you a member of the communist party ?
thank you .
if you enjoy my music and the way i play ... ... it' s because the revolution has given me the opportunity .
thank you and goodnight .
it' s not gonna work out .
yes , we' re so close , don' t say that .
he won' t go for it .
he will .
just do what you have been doing .
give the government credit for everything .
even the air that i breathe .
a personal gift from fidel .
i thought you only got nervous for auditions .
what do you think this is ?
mi socio , all the bookings have been arranged .
have a good trip .
be careful with the women over there .
i need a favor .
a favor ?
i was hoping that my family can join me on this tour .
i' ve been on tour three times this year .
it' s too much time away .
let me be honest with you .
it' s the united nation band .
paquito , ignacio , two defectors .
we' re concerned that you' re going to be playing with two counter revolutionaries .
it' s not gonna be a problem .
are you sure ?
no problem .
are you willing to denounce paquito ?
no .
if a foreign reporter asks you how you feel about paquito , what would you say ?
i would say we share the same stage but not the same views .
good .
had you denounced him , i would' ve known there was something wrong .
come over here .
i' il see what i can do .
i' m going to try my best .
okay , my friend ?
we can' t tell anybody about our plans , not even our parents .
it' s for their own protection .
when i leave , it has to be like any other trip .
no crying , no problem .
we just leave , okay ?
you can' t pack too much because you' il call attention to yourself .
but i' ve got to bring so many things .
i have to pack for you , leonel and turi .
thank god emilia gave me that suitcase .
they didn' t authorize leonel' s visa .
he' s of military age .
but we got permission .
you said we got permission .
we did , but not leonel .
i just found out .
he' s my son , they have to let him go with us .
he is forbidden to travel , no exceptions .
we can' t leave him behind .
we' il find a way to bring him .
how ?
paquito was going to bring his family and they' re still here .
we said we' d go as a family .
i swear to you , i tried , but there' s no exceptions .
he' s on call for seven years .
seven years .
we will wait , that' s not so long .
turi' s gonna be military age , that' s another seven years .
if we don' t go now , none of us will ever get out .
you want me to leave my son ?
he' s my son too , you know .
then how could you think about leaving him ?
you go .
listen to me .
you know i' m not gonna go without you , anywhere .
i won' t leave my boy .
he' s not a boy anymore .
he' s my son .
listen to me .
no matter how long it takes ... ... even if i have to take a boat back ... ... i will get leonel and bring him back to us , i promise you .
he will be with us .
we have to be strong .
look at me !
we have to be strong .
we have to make the first move or else we' re never gonna get our family out .
come on , trust me .
come here .
let me help you with that .
i got it .
come on , it' s my job now .
i got it .
nice taxi , doctor .
thank you .
i have realized my full potential .
i wanna go with you , papi .
i know , turi .
i' m gonna see you in london in two weeks , okay ?
you take care of mommy .
take care of yourself .
be careful .
thank you .
for what ?
for teaching me how to play dominoes .
you still got a lot more to learn .
take good care of the car .
don' t bury it .
i' il see you soon .
i' m scared .
trust me .
take care of mommy , okay ?
and bring her to london .
we' il be there in two weeks .
i don' t want to make a scene in front of my mother ... ... but i don' t want to pretend like i respect you .
you don' t have all the information .
i used to think that you were something .
the way you never backed down .
you' re just like the rest of ' em .
i' m so sorry you feel that way .
sorry ?
don' t feel sorry for me , be sorry for turi .
because all you ever do is teach him how to sell out .
you' re still not packed ?
i don' t know , papi .
i don' t know what i will need .
i saw your mommy last night .
no , in a dream .
pap no est loco .
how is she ?
she' s worried , mi nia .
she said to me , " sosa , our daughter is leaving ...
... and you must do everything in your power to help her .
mi nia , mi amor .
quite a dream .
i tried ....
i tried to tell you  don' t .
in my old age ... ... nothing will give me greater peace than to know that you are safe .
and happy .
mi cielo , wherever you are ... ... we' il always be together .
come here .
you know i love you .
i love you , too .
don' t worry , i' il take care of him .
it' s only gonna be a month , okay ?
take care of yourself .
you make a very compelling case .
but i have to be honest with you .
i don' t think this is going to be easy .
maybe i could try to explain better .
you did explain to me .
but this application is going to be reviewed in d. c.
on paper it appears that you benefited from the system ... ... and that your motives are financial .
that' s just not true .
the burden of proof is on you , you see and on paper
change the paper .
excuse me ?
you tell' em .
please .
i will make my recommendations .
i will start the process , but
how long is the process ?
it' s hard to tell .
it could be a week , a month .
there' s no way of knowing .
what am i supposed to do ?
do you realize how hard it was to get my family out of cuba ?
do you know how long we' ve planned this ?
we are completely exposed .
you must find a way of protecting us .
the law states you must be in immediate and observable danger
they shot two defectors in london two months
i can' t offer official protection .
you must understand .
my wife and son are by themselves .
listen to me .
no one will know you were here .
you just continue the tour as if nothing happened .
i can' t go back .
it' s not up to me .
there' s nothing else i can do .
i' il tell mr. gillespie that you' re waiting .
what am i supposed to do ?
just do what the man says .
go on the tour and be cool , baby , we' il work it out .
we gotta go , come on .
hold on !
damnit !
they hung up .
listen , i' ve been through this , okay ?
ten feet , but you' re not gonna get there if you don' t move .
we intercepted this from the u. s. interest section .
arturo sandoval .
what' s this ?
johnny , line two , it' s havana .
hello ?
what ?
something' s up .
they know marianela' s in london .
they' re asking questions .
slow down .
listen to me , they' re gonna find out and take her back to cuba .
that ain' t gonna happen .
i gotta go now , man , i gotta defect right now .
take it easy .
one in there from the white house .
you gonna call the president ?
vice president , met him on air force one .
the cat said if i need anything , give him a call .
play the gig tonight , and then you' il be on the plane .
wait for me !
if you get through to the embassy , tell them it won' t take us too long .
you' re mrs. sandoval ?
yes .
come with me , quickly .
these are your documents , all in order .
when you get to new york just stay on the plane .
this man from the state department will meet you on the plane .
do not get off the plane with anybody else .
what about my husband ?
i' m sorry , we haven' t heard anything yet .
you really don' t know what this is all about .
they defected ?
it' s up to you to bring them home where they belong .
there' s nothing that i can say that could ever bring them back .
please , come with us .
