halt !
halt !
stop !
what ?
stop !
stop !
you' re going the wrong way .
we have to get to berlin .
brody' s this way .
my diary' s in berlin .
we don' t need the diary , dad .
marcus has the map .
there is more in the diary than just the map .
all right , dad .
tell me .
well , he who finds the grail must face the final challenge .
what final challenge ?
three devices of such lethal cunning .
booby traps ?
oh , yes .
but i found the clues that will safely take us through , in the chronicles of st. anselm .
well , what are they ?
can' t you remember ?
i wrote them down in my diary so that i wouldn' t have to remember .
half the german army' s on our tail , and you want me to go to berlin ?
into the lion' s den ?
yes .
the only thing that matters is the grail .
what about marcus ?
marcus would agree with me .
two selfless martyrs .
jesus christ .
that' s for blasphemy .
the quest for the grail is not archaeology .
it' s a race against evil .
if it is captured by the nazis , the armies of darkness will march all over the face of the earth .
do you understand me ?
this is an obsession , dad .
i never understood it .
never .
neither did mom .
oh , yes , she did .
only too well .
unfortunately , she kept her illness from me until all i could do was mourn her .
my boy , we are pilgrims in an unholy land .
fraulein doctor .
where is it ?
how did you get here ?
where is it ?
i want it .
you came back for the book ?
why ?
my father didn' t want it incinerated .
is that what you think of me ?
i believe in the grail , not the swastika .
but you stood up to be counted with the enemy of everything that the grail stands for .
who gives a damn what you think ?
you do .
all i have to do is squeeze .
all i have to do is scream .
i' ve got it .
let' s get the hell out of here .
what did you get ?
i don' t know .
first available flight out of germany .
good .
well , we made it .
when we' re airborne , with germany behind us , then i' il share that sentiment .
relax .
tickets , please .
guten tag ... herr jones .
tickets , please .
oh , we should get out of here .
no ticket .
ticket .
ticket !
ticket !
ticket ! ticket !
you know , sharing your adventures is an interesting experience .
that' s not all we shared .
it' s disgraceful .
you' re old enough to be her fa ... her her grandfather .
well , i' m as human as the next man .
i was the next man .
oh .
of course .
well ... ships that pass in the night .
do you remember the last time we had a quiet drink , hmm ?
i had a milkshake .
hmm ?
what did we talk about ?
we didn' t talk .
we never talked .
do i detect a rebuke ?
a regret .
it was just the two of us , dad .
it was a lonely way to grow up .
for you , too .
if you' d been an ordinary , average father ,
like the other guys ' dads , you' d have understood that .
actually , i was a wonderful father .
when ?
did i ever tell you to eat up ?
go to bed ?
wash your ears ?
do your homework ?
no .
i respected your privacy , and i taught you self reliance .
what you taught me was that i was less important to you than people who' d been dead for 500 years in another country .
and i learned it so well that we' ve hardly spoken for 20 years .
you left just when you were becoming interesting .
unbelievable .
dad , how can you ... ?
very well .
i' m here now .
what do you want to talk about ?
hmm ?
well , i ... uh ...
i can' t think of anything .
then what are you complaining about ?
look , we have work to do .
when we get to alexandretta , we will face three challenges .
the first ,
the breath of god .
only the penitent man will pass .
second ,
the word of god .
only in the footsteps of god will he proceed .
third ,
the path of god .
only in the leap from the lion' s head will he prove his worth .
what does that mean ?
i don' t know .
we' il find out .
we' re turning around .
they' re taking us back to germany .
well , i thought it would take them a lot longer to figure out the radio was dead .
come on , dad .
move !
come on , dad .
come on !
i didn' t know you could fly a plane .
fly , yes .
land , no .
dad , you' re going to have to use the machine gun .
get it ready .
eleven o' clock !
dad , eleven o' clock !
what happens at eleven o' clock ?
twelve , eleven , ten .
eleven o' clock , fire !
dad , are we hit ? !
more or less .
son , i' m sorry .
they got us .
hang on , dad .
we' re going in !
nice landing .
thanks .
those people are trying to kill us !
i know , dad !
well .
it' s a new experience for me .
it happens to me all the time .
this is intolerable !
this could be close .
faster , boy !
faster !
well , they don' t come any closer than that !
dad , he' s coming back !
i suddenly remembered my charlemagne .
let my armies be the rocks and the trees and the birds in the sky .
these pages are taken from professor jones ' diary , your highness , and they include a map that pinpoints the exact location of the grail .
as you can see , the grail is all but in our hands .
however , your highness , we would not think of crossing your soil without your permission , nor of removing the grail from your borders without suitable compensation .
what have you brought ?
precious valuables , your highness , donated by some of the finest families in all of germany .
ah !
rolls royce phantom two .
four point three liter , 30 horsepower , six cylinder engine , with stromberg downdraft carburetor .
can go from zero to 100 kilometers an hour in 12 . 5 seconds .
and i even like the color .
the keys are in the ignition , your highness .
you shall have camels , horses , an armed escort , provisions , desert vehicles and tanks .
you' re welcome .
we have no time to lose .
indiana jones and his father have escaped .
we go this way .
get that camel out of the way .
what happened to marcus , sallah ?
ah , they set out across the desert this afternoon .
i believe they took mr. brody with them .
now they have the map .
and in this sort of race , there' s no silver medal for finishing second .
care to wet your whistle , marcus ?
i' d rather spit in your face .
but as i haven' t got any spit ... must be within three or four miles .
otherwise we are off the map .
well , marcus , we are on the brink of the recovery of the greatest artifact in the history of mankind .
you' re meddling with powers you cannot possibly comprehend .
ah , i see brody .
he seems okay .
they' ve got a tank .
six pound gun .
what do you think you' re doing there ?
get down !
dad , we' re well out of range .
that car belonged to my brother in law .
come on , come on !
i can' t see anyone up there .
maybe it wasn' t even jones .
no , it is him , all right .
he' s here somewhere .
put brody in the tank .
well , in this sun , without transportation , they' re as good as dead .
it' s jones , all right .
now , who are all these people ?
who cares ?
as long as they' re keeping donovan busy .
dad , you stay here while sallah and i organize some transportation .
i' m going after those horses .
i' il take the camels .
i don' t need camels .
but , indy ... no camels .
who is he ?
a messenger from god .
for the unrighteous , the cup of life holds everlasting damnation .
marcus !
oh .
genius of the restoration ... " " aid our own resuscitation .
henry , what are you doing here ?
it' s a rescue , old boy .
come on .
search him .
what is in this book ?
that miserable little diary of yours .
we have the map .
the book is useless .
and yet you come all the way back to berlin to get it .
why ?
what are you hiding ?
what does the diary tell you that it doesn' t tell us ?
it tells me that goose stepping morons like yourself should try reading books instead of burning them .
colonel !
jones is getting away .
i think not , herr donovan .
not that jones , the other jones !
sallah , i said no camels !
that' s five camels .
can' t you count ?
compensation for my brother in law' s car .
indy , your father and brody ... where' s my father ?
they have them .
in the belly of that steel beast .
hyah !
hyah , hyah , hyah !
hey ah , hey ah , hey ah !
fire !
dad !
dad !
dad !
junior ?
junior ? !
junior !
dad !
dad !
dad !
get out !
henry , the pen ...
what ?
but don' t you see ?
the pen is mightier than the sword .
look what you did .
it' s war .
didn' t i tell you it was a rescue , huh ?
dad !
yeah ?
you call this archaeology ?
get out of there , dad .
how does one get off this thing ?
where' s marcus ?
dad !
hang on , dad !
father of indy , give me your hand !
sallah !
get dad !
give me your hand !
junior !
indy !
oh , god .
i' ve lost him .
and i never told him anything .
i just wasn' t ready , marcus .
five minutes would have been enough .
i thought i' d lost you , boy !
i thought you had too , sir .
mmm ...
well ... well done .
come on .
let' s go , then .
why are you sitting there resting when we' re so near the end ? !
come on , let' s go !
the canyon of the crescent moon .
helmut , another volunteer !
i never expected to see you again .
i' m like a bad penny ; i always turn up .
step back now , dr .
schneider .
give dr .
jones some room .
he' s going to recover the grail for us .
impossible ?
what do you say , jones ?
ready to go down in history ?
as what ?
a nazi stooge like you ?
the nazis ? !
is that the limit of your vision ?
the nazis want to write themselves into the grail legend ... take on the world .
well , they' re welcome .
but i want the grail itself .
the cup that gives everlasting life .
hitler can have the world , but he can' t take it with him .
i' m going to be drinking my own health when he' s gone the way of the dodo .
the grail is mine ... and you' re going to get it for me .
shooting me won' t get you anywhere .
you know something , dr .
jones ?
you' re absolutely right .
dad ?
dad ? !
junior ...
no !
get back !
you can' t save him when you' re dead !
the healing power of the grail is the only thing that can save your father now .
it' s time to ask yourself what you believe .
the breath of god ... ... only the penitent man will pass .
the penitent man will pass .
the penitent man will pass .
the penitent man ... " only the penitent man will pass .
only the penitent man will pass .
the penitent man will pass .
the penitent , penitent ... the penitent man ... the penitent man ... the penitent ... the penitent man is humble before god .
penitent .
penitent ... the penitent man ... penitent man is humble ... ... kneels before god .
kneel !
i' m through !
we' re through .
he' s all right .
no .
the word of god .
only in the footsteps of god will he proceed .
the word of god ... the word of ...
proceed in the footsteps of the word .
the word of god ... " no , henry .
try not to talk .
the name of god ... the name of god ...
jehovah .
but in the latin alphabet , jehovah begins with an " i.
j ...
oh , dear .
idiot !
in latin , jehovah starts with an " i.
l " ...
e " ...
h " ...
o " ... oh !
v " ...
a " ...
the path of god .
only in the leap from the lion' s head will he prove his worth .
impossible ... nobody can jump this .
indy !
indy , you must hurry !
come quickly !
it' s a leap of faith .
oh , geez ... you must believe , boy .
you must ... believe .
oh .
i knew you' d come , but my strength has left me .
who are you ?
the last of three brothers who swore an oath to find the grail and to guard it .
that was 700 years ago .
a long time to wait .
you' re strangely dressed ... for a knight .
i' m not exactly ... a knight .
what do you mean ?
i was chosen because i was the bravest , the most worthy .
the honor was mine until another came to challenge me to single combat .
i pass it ... to you who vanquished me .
listen , i don' t have time to explain , but ...
which one is it ?
you must choose , but choose wisely .
for as the true grail will bring you life , the false grail will take it from you .
i' m not a historian .
i have no idea what it looks like .
which one is it ?
let me choose .
thank you , doctor .
oh , yes .
it' s more beautiful than i' d ever imagined .
this certainly is the cup of the king of kings .
eternal life .
what is happening to me ?
oh !
tell me , what is happening ?
he chose ... poorly .
it would not be made out of goid .
that' s the cup of a carpenter .
there' s only one way to find out .
you have chosen wisely .
but the grail cannot pass beyond the great seal .
that is the boundary and the price of immortality .
drop your guns .
please .
dad , come on , get to your feet .
we have got it .
come on !
elsa !
elsa , don' t move !
it' s ours , indy ... yours and mine .
elsa , don' t cross the seal .
the knight warned us not to take the grail from here .
junior !
junior !
elsa ...
elsa , don' t .
elsa ...
elsa ... give me your other hand , honey .
i can' t hold you !
i can reach it .
i can reach it .
elsa , give me your hand .
give me your other hand !
elsa !
junior , give me your other hand !
i can' t hold on .
i can get it .
i can almost reach it , dad .
indiana ...
indiana ...
let it go .
dad ...
please , dad .
elsa never really believed in the grail .
she thought she' d found a prize .
what did you find , dad ?
me ?
illumination .
and what did you find , junior ?
junior " ?
dad ... please , what does it always mean , this ... this " junior " ?
henry jones , junior .
i like indiana .
we named the dog indiana .
may we go home now , please ?
the dog ?
you are named after the dog ?
i' ve got a lot of fond memories of that dog .
ready ?
ready .
indy !
henry !
follow me .
i know the way !
ha !
got lost in his own museum , huh ?
uh huh .
after you , junior .
yes , sir .
ha !
