think she' il get over thisaway ?
might .
best bed them down .
come on , tig .
there she goes .
looks like we' re in for it .
you see them ?
can' t see them .
can' t hear them .
you ever seen one this bad ?
not since noah and the flood .
well , you should know , boss , since you was there .
what did you say ?
he said , " you should know since you was there .
well , even that wasn' t this damn wet .
one thing' s certain .
noah never shoveled as much bull from them he had aboard .
let' s rustle up some grub .
mose ?
hey !
that hurt ?
yeah .
mose , still got them cards ?
yeah , i got them .
get them out , and let' s have us a game after breakfast .
button !
pull them plates under here .
you gonna play them cards , mose , or stare a hole through them ?
don' t rush me .
i' il take four .
oh , for pity' s sakes .
take four .
all right , that' s it .
i' m out .
me too .
a man' s trust is a valuable thing , button .
you don' t want to lose it for a handful of cards .
well , at least it ain' t raining .
get yourself dressed , button .
help mose get things cleaned up .
then you walk out and look for them horses .
looks like you could use a little muscle there , charley .
you just keep on like you are .
you' il get your chance soon enough .
no need to ask for more chores , mose .
every man' s got to pull his weight .
yeah , but my weight is half of yours .
you know , it' s hard to figure charley sometimes .
i ain' t even sure if he likes me .
he likes you .
you know , boss had some pause about hiring me on .
too big to get around on horses and work them cows .
afraid i' d eat too much .
it was charley that talked him into it , and i ain' t one to take a man' s confidence lightly .
you know i ain' t , either .
i know you ain' t , but it' s best to keep remembering it if you want respect when you' re riding with men like charley and boss .
button , pull .
pull it .
button !
button !
quit playing with that dog and pull the wagon !
pull it !
pull !
oh , yeah !
yeah .
that' s it .
hey , hey !
look at that !
old boss sure can cowboy , can' t he ?
yeah .
broke the mold after him .
main bunch is working towards water .
we' il go up country , find the rest , and we' il push them there .
look at that .
a couple of damn kids .
anyway , once we get them , we can start driving them back closer to camp .
it' il be a while before we see another town .
could use supplies , coffee and such .
mose !
ow !
mose !
you' il have to ride back to that town we passed .
when you want me to go ?
tonight .
i' il go .
i can go .
how long you figure , charley ?
without cows slowing things , maybe one day there , one back .
sounds about right .
come on , boss .
i can do it .
sure you can , boy .
just don' t know if that town' s ready to have you turned loose on it just yet .
english !
damn !
shit !
bullshit !
by god , if you' re gonna pick your feet like a monkey , you do it downwind .
swear to god , old tig takes better care of herself .
starting to think it was a mistake not getting you on in some town to learn a trade .
i don' t like towns .
never liked them .
oh , you' re just saying that ' cause you heard me say it .
get yourself a trade and set up in a town .
you' il always have a roof over your head , a bed up off the ground , and food no further away than a caf .
ain' t that so , charley ?
that was a big help .
might as well be talking to this horse .
put your boot on , button .
let' s go to work .
course , if you was to live in a town ...
you' d have to clean up some .
otherwise , no one could stand the stink .
what you do that for ? !
cheating at cards .
cheating .
i apologized to you for that !
eh , boss ?
i apologized to him for that .
evidently he ain' t over it yet .
it' s getting dark , boss .
he could have got hurt between that town and the camp .
probably just taking his time .
don' t suppose he got into a poker game , do you ?
wouldn' t gamble your money , boss .
what if he' s lying out there waiting for us to come along ?
we' d never find him tonight .
now , come on down from there .
he' s worried .
you worried ?
yeah , i' m worried .
been worried since yesterday .
should have sent me .
mose can look out for himself .
then why ain' t he here with us ?
well , you never was wanting to go to towns .
well , i don' t want to go now neither .
but we better find him , wherever he is .
all right .
you and me strike out early .
button can watch the outfit .
button , come on down from there and get supper a working .
most likely be back before suppertime .
but three sets of eyes , it' s better than two .
you stay with the wagon .
come on , boss .
no one is gonna bother it .
we haven' t seen a single person since we set up the camp .
i always feel better if someone' s close around .
you been working hard , deserve a little loafing time .
stay right here .
stay , tig .
wants to go .
she acts like she does , but she don' t .
still got the heart , not the legs .
you keep that rifle close .
always liked me a sidearm with some heft .
took this off a man who couldn' t pay all he owed for some cows .
damn fine weapon .
always noticed you favor something light , don' t you ?
set it right down .
thank you .
hello !
howdy .
howdy .
like to feed and water them , curry them down with saddles on .
okay , that' il be four bits each .
there you go .
thank you .
not planning on staying long ?
long as it takes to find who we' re looking for .
maybe i can help you gents .
i been here since harmonville was fort harmon and we still had soldiers to chase off lndians .
i know everybody in town and for miles beyond .
big man needing a haircut , about 30 .
that' s his rig right there .
oh , yeah .
know who you' re talking about .
very friendly young fella .
looks like he' s been living out of saddlebags most of his life .
got his horse in the corral .
ride with you , does he ?
know where we can find him ?
yeah .
yeah , he' s up in the jailhouse .
he got into it with some cattlemen over at the general store .
some cattlemen .
yeah .
busted them up pretty bad , too , before marshal poole came up and hit him over the head with his gun barrel .
yeah , he' s lucky he didn' t get shot in the back .
you might want to keep that in mind when you' re talking to marshal poole .
saddle his horse .
that cover what he owes ?
oh , yeah .
name' s percy if you should need anything else .
much obliged .
hold on .
how long you had him here ?
i brought him in here yesterday afternoon .
it wasn' t easy getting him into the cell .
why is that ?
goddamn bear .
size of it .
evening .
name' s boss spearman .
this here' s charley waite .
evening .
believe you have a friend of ours .
name' s mose harrison .
yeah , i got him here .
he started a fight in the general store .
mose don' t start fights , just finishes them .
i just said he started it .
you said he didn' t .
maybe you' re calling me a liar .
you got a charge against him ?
i got plenty .
lnciting a fight .
disturbing the peace .
creating a public nuisance .
take your pick .
hear tell he got hit over the head .
he' il be fine .
well , i come to get him .
well , you pay the fines , and you can have him .
how does $50 each offense sound ?
like robbery .
lot of money .
oh , yes , a lot of money .
i been waiting for you , mr. spearman .
my name' s denton baxter .
be your men mose tussled with .
that' s right .
you know , folks in fort harmon country don' t take to free grazers or free grazing .
they hate them more than they used to hate the lndians .
i expect by " folks , " you mean ranchers like yourself .
i got the biggest spread around .
bigger than any three or four put together .
built it up with me own two hands , piece by piece , along with this town .
and there ain' t no free graze cattle gonna take the feed off my cattle on this range .
free graze is legal .
times change , mr. spearman .
most folks change with them .
a few holdouts never do .
you know , a few years back , a free graze outfit came through .
one night , the cattle got stampeded , the wagons caught on fire , and one of those boys was shot off his horse in the middle of it all .
shot in the back , was he ?
your man' s horse and rig are at the livery barn .
you can take him with you when you leave tonight .
and come sunrise , you hitch up your wagon and get your damn free graze cattle moving and keep them moving till you' re out of fort harmon country !
now , you let mr. spearman fetch his man so he can be on his way .
charley .
mose .
mose .
looks like someone' s put the boots to him after he was down .
does it ?
mose , you gotta get up .
charley , i' m glad to see you .
i don' t much like this town .
here you go .
boy , they really lit into him .
you got a doctor in this town ?
yeah .
doc barlow .
it' s the house up behind the barn by the church .
look for a picket fence .
he' s got a sign out front .
oh , my .
bring him right in .
lay him down in there .
i' il fetch the doctor .
get his legs , boss .
easy , easy .
good .
i' m dr. barlow .
boss spearman .
charley waite .
patient there' s mose harrison .
he works for me .
these wounds are old .
easier to treat if you bring him in right away .
your marshal had him , and he don' t keep a friendly jail .
this is the man who was in the fight with dent baxter' s men ?
he certainly gave as good as he got .
broke the arm of one .
knowing them , they had it coming , i expect .
let' s see what we got here .
aah !
easy .
easy , mose .
easy , mr. harrison .
nobody' s trying to hurt you on purpose .
i' d say you got a couple of broken ribs .
gonna need to get this shirt off .
sue , i am gonna need some soap , some water , and some alcohol .
i want you to drink this , mr. harrison .
that' s it .
let' s clean up these cuts on his face .
he' s got a nice gash in his scalp there .
i' d say to good health , but then i' d probably be out of business .
we' il drink to good health for them that have it coming .
the two of you can wait in the parlor .
be better he didn' t travel .
well , he' il have to .
how much i owe you , doctor ?
we' re even .
i figured i made enough off the damage he did to baxter' s men .
wish he' d have made you wealthy .
ma' am .
doc barlow' s got him a pretty wife .
notice that , did you ?
well , i ain' t dead .
glad to hear it .
sweet , too .
treated us as good as anybody .
that' s a real lady .
a woman like that makes a man think about setting down roots , eh ?
doc looks like a real hardworking feller .
probably working away on making some little ones , too .
creates quite a picture , now , don' t it ?
yeah .
heard they' re worth a thousand words .
hey , tig .
now , where do you suppose he is ?
goddamn kid .
button' s all right , boss .
anyone done him harm , they' d have gone through the wagon .
reckon you' re right .
here he is .
lf you' re awake , you might want to see this .
where you been ? !
i seen it before .
out with the herd .
i thought i told you to stay with the wagon .
what happened to mose ?
did you hear what i said ? !
yeah , but what happened ?
run into a little trouble in that town .
looks like more than a little .
are we moving on ?
we always do , don' t we , once we' ve grazed off a place ?
did i do something wrong ?
just leave him be for a while .
here .
have some coffee .
made fresh , for a change .
there was three riders scouting up the herd this morning .
where ?
maybe half a mile out .
just sitting there , looking at the cattle .
same ones ?
four this time .
country' s filling up .
maybe we should push on .
do no good , button .
i seen them like baxter before .
he means to have this herd or scatter it to the wind .
lf he was gonna take the herd , why not just keep you in town ?
marshal already had mose .
wants us all in one place .
far from there when it happens .
don' t make no sense , him telling us to move on and all .
weren' t the only thing he said .
most time , a man will tell you his bad intentions if you listen , let yourself hear .
a few years back , a free graze outfit come through .
that weren' t no idle story .
let' s find out for certain .
beautiful country .
a man can get lost out here , forget there' s people and things that ain' t so simple as this .
how long we been riding together , charley ?
nigh on 1 0 years .
mm hmm .
you know what they call that , call it a decade .
long time .
been a lot of change since then .
what' s on your mind , boss ?
way i figure it , we can leave the cattle and run , or you and me can go in the dark and stop them before they scatter the herd .
you reckon them cows are worth getting killed over ?
the cows is one thing .
but one man telling another where he can go in this country' s something else .
that rancher sat in that jailhouse , sneering and letting his lawman lay down the law till he figured it was time to show us that he gave the orders around here .
ooh , sticks in my craw .
well , we sure as hell owe them for what they done to mose .
yeah .
i' il saddle the horses .
you two keep a sharp eye out .
got the scatter gun .
we' il be watching for them .
you' il want to douse that fire .
button , keep to the wagon .
i don' t want to see you out in the open .
okay ?
i got some sugar in that town .
it' s in the wagon .
i wouldn' t want to have him coming down on me
like these cowboys .
what the hell' s the matter with you , gus ?
you' re twitching all damn night .
damn back' s so sore from being flung into that stove .
feel like i been humped by a 300 pound whore .
well , gus , i' d say you got off easy .
look at my face .
well , you can bet butler will square things with that big man for breaking his arm and all .
did you hear it snap ?
i heard it snap .
lucky for him he shoots with either hand .
one twitch , and you' re in hell !
now , get on your feet , all of you !
now , throw them guns on the ground .
i ain' t a gonna say it again .
and kick them away .
which one of you' s got a sore back ?
which one ?
him .
you' re gus ?
yeah .
ought not gang up on a man three to one .
ohh !
wait a minute , mister .
it wasn' t our idea to jump him .
shut up , wylie .
get up , you son of a bitch .
what' s your name ?
vince .
mighty nice tie down you got .
you' re a gunhand , are you ?
you fast ?
no .
uh huh .
how many riders does he have ?
i said , how many riders ?
the rest are on their way to your wagon .
uhh !
aah !
you want to smile now , go ahead .
be a while before he' s of use .
charley , throw me them saddlebags .
put your spook hats on .
the ones in your belt , put them on .
now get your britches off .
not taking my britches off for nobody .
you listen out of your good ear now .
now , get them off !
pretty scary bunch , eh , charley ?
get belly down , flat out !
uhh !
get your peckers in the dirt .
hyah !
hah !
hah !
lf i hear so much as a twig break ...
i' il come back and kill you all .
charley .
charley !
no tig come to meet us .
ooh .
the bastards .
they shot the boy , but he' s alive .
ls that mose ?
he' s dead .
shot him in the head .
charley ?
charley ?
charley , get the lantern and the whiskey .
yeah .
come on , wake up .
charley .
they shot him here and cracked him in the head here .
we' il have to dig that bullet out .
you done good , boss .
him going in and out like that .
i don' t know .
he lost a lot of blood .
a whack on the head can make a man strange for the rest of his days .
well , you done all you can .
he needs a doctor now .
lf button lives through morning , you take him in the wagon and move on .
you just gonna sit out here waiting with them cows ?
that' s right .
and i' m gonna kill every son of a bitch that comes to take them .
for one man on open ground , you sure got a lot of killing in mind .
you know i never gone against you , boss .
always let you do most of the talking .
but he needs that doctor back in that town , and i aim to take him .
lf you want to come , we' il go together .
otherwise , you do what you have to do , i' il do the same .
you think they' il let you waltz in there and waltz out ?
i don' t figure into it .
button deserves every chance we can give him .
all right .
but i aim to kill baxter and those that done this .
and if that marshal gets in the way , i' m gonna kill him , too .
so you best get your mind right about what' s got to be done .
i got no problem with killing , boss .
never have .
looks real nice , charley .
yeah , a man ought to have something to show he was here .
be gone in another big storm .
don' t matter none .
he' s got your dog for company .
he' d like it you put old tig with him .
yeah , he was more mose' s dog in the end than he was mine .
be right to say some words .
you want to speak with the man upstairs , do it .
i' il stand right here and listen , but i ain' t talking to that son of a bitch .
and i' il be holding a grudge for him letting this befall a sweet kid like mose .
well , he sure as hell wasn' t one to complain .
woke with a smile .
seemed like he could keep it there all day .
kind of man that' d say " good morning " and mean it , whether it was or not .
to tell you the truth , lord , if there was two gentler souls ,
i never seen them .
seemed like old tig wouldn' t even kill birds in the end .
well , you got yourself a good man and a good dog , and i' m inclined to agree with boss about holding a grudge against you for it .
i guess that means " amen .
god .
charley , you all right ?
i' m fine .
seems like you was , you know ...
i said i' m fine .
just got some old feelings coming up .
you know , we never asked each other much .
that' s always been okay with me .
i figured it was okay with you .
but you said some things the last couple of days .
things that seemed like they had kind of a history to them .
hey , charley ?
don' t stand behind me , boss .
when i was a kid , a bunch of us would go into the woods with our peashooters .
nothing fancy , just enough to kill a bird or a squirrel , maybe something larger if we was lucky .
killed my first man in them woods .
held the paper on our farm , and after my pa died , he' d come around to get payment from my mom in any way he could .
weren' t much older than button when i shot him in the throat .
knew there' d be more killing , so i run off and joined the army .
war was on .
they was only too happy to have me .
my first skirmish was like hunting with my friends .
we just sat up in some trees , and they came marching at us .
must have been a hundred of them dead after the smoke cleared .
went around and shot the rest who weren' t .
those of us with the knack was made into a special squad so we could travel light and on our own into enemy territory .
orders were pretty simple .
make trouble wherever we could .
with room like that , it wasn' t long before we was killing men that weren' t even in uniform .
seemed like that went on the rest of the war .
after that , i come west .
lot of call for a man with them skills .
and i put them to work for men just like baxter .
every once in a while , i almost get through a day without thinking about who i am , what i' d done .
he drifted off again .
no better , but no worse , either .
you' re a real honest man , charley .
well , i ain' t gonna lie about button .
not button i' m talking about .
mr. spearman .
the doctor in ?
no , he' s not here .
we got a boy that' s hurt bad .
here , put him in the examining room .
it' s not his hearing , ma' am .
he hears real well when he' s awake .
mr. spearman , i' m checking if there' s blood in his ears .
it could mean a fractured skull .
are you the boy' s father ?
no , ma' am .
his name' s button , and he works for me .
it appears that' s not very healthy .
you know the way to the parlor .
sit down .
i' il be a while .
well , i don' t think it' s a fracture .
concussion' s more likely , but it' s bad .
i have to admit , we don' t see a lot of people shot .
i cleaned and dressed the wound .
doesn' t look infected .
what about the fever ?
he needs to lay still and let his body do its work .
no offense , ma' am , but we come a long way to see that the boy gets looked after proper by dr. barlow .
now , where' s he at ?
one of dent baxter' s hands came and fetched him out to the ranch .
some men there had an accident night before last .
you must tell me what happened , mr. spearman .
baxter sent his men to stampede the herd , and i figured me and charley to stop them .
surprised them where they was hiding , and we had at them .
them' s the one dr. barlow' s putting back together .
we got back to camp , others had shot mose in the head , shot button , left him for dead .
oh .
shot our dog .
i' il be getting money .
it' s not necessary .
we pay our way , ma' am .
please , sit , mr. waite .
button .
ls that his real name ?
please , sit .
yeah , it' s the only one we' ve known .
he' s just a boy .
yeah .
picked him up in a texas town a few years back ,
living off caf garbage .
couldn' t speak a word of english .
thought we was doing him a favor .
what about you ?
hmm ?
you know that the marshal works for baxter .
people saw you ride in .
there' s payment to be made by them that done this .
don' t intend to run .
we could wire for the federal marshal .
lf he started riding today , he wouldn' t make it for a week .
with the storm coming , maybe longer .
we' re obliged to deal with the marshal and baxter ourselves .
what about button ?
well , he' s fighting for his life .
we' re gonna do the same .
whatever' s needed for button , you do it .
lf he wakes , he' s gonna need to stay here a couple days so we can watch him .
whatever' s best for him .
can' t stay away from my little paradise , gents ? !
believe satan says the same at the gates of hell , old timer !
we' d like to put the horses up .
had a tough trail .
i' d like to set the wagon yonder .
help yourself !
hurry up , though !
i seen it like this before !
big one' s coming !
hyah , hyah , hyah !
son of a bitch .
sorry , charley .
yeah .
jesus christ .
ooh , hoo , hoo , hoo !
maybe you should have built it in another spot .
ah , mercy .
get the dog !
get the dog !
get the dog !
it' s a dog there , charley .
take this .
there he is .
back here , charley !
to your left !
to your left !
get him !
get him !
you all right , charley ?
yeah , considering i' ve just been swimming .
i owe you , mister .
that' s a sweet pup you got there .
remind you of anyone , charley ?
small version .
too small to be let out in this weather .
belongs to my daughter .
i tried to grab him , but the water was too fast for me .
lf you' re going into the caf ,
i' d be proud to buy you both a cup of coffee .
coffee would be good about now .
this is like the storm that washed away gunnison 1 0 , 1 2 years back .
the water come down from the mountains .
nowhere to go but straight into town .
killed a lot of folks .
it' s okay , bill .
town' s been here a long time , mack .
it' il be here a lot longer .
that' s right , papa .
every once in a while , a good storm washes through and leaves her as clean as a baby' s bottom .
got to look on the bright side , gents .
marshal .
meat and spuds , les , as always .
that should cover our meal .
worth a man' s life to walk across that road tonight .
thanks for the coffee .
well , appreciate what you done .
that' il be two bits .
two bits .
i' il be having words with you two .
and we' il be having more than that with you , marshal .
no need to make the caf messy ... with folks .
i' ve got a warrant sworn out for your arrest for assaulting baxter' s men .
we got a warrant sworn for attempted murder for them that tried to kill the boy who' s laying over there at the doc' s .
swore out another one for them that murdered the big fellow you had in your cell .
only ours ain' t writ by no tin star bought and paid for , marshal .
it' s writ by us .
and we aim to enforce it .
ls that so ?
we got no quarrel with none of you folks .
baxter' s men bushwhacked our friend and shot him dead .
shot a 1 6 year old boy , too .
and clubbed him so hard ...
he might not live .
tried to take our cattle .
your marshal here ain' t gonna do nothing about it .
you don' t like free grazers in this town .
we don' t much like being here .
but a man' s got a right to protect his property and his life .
and we ain' t letting no rancher or his lawman take either .
we got no intention of harming bystanders .
anyone who helps or comforts these goddamn lawbreaking free grazers is gonna have to deal with me .
your call , marshal .
we don' t have to settle this here and now .
you ain' t going nowhere in this weather .
but i' il be seeing you gents real soon .
you can count on that .
that marshal ain' t gonna wait .
that son of a bitch is gonna get some men , come looking for us .
he' s gonna need us locked up tight in that jail by the time baxter hits town , ' cause if we ain' t ,
baxter' s gonna start to think that maybe marshal poole ain' t worth what he' s paying him .
you got something on your mind , just spit it out .
well , i say we take him right at the jail .
lock him up , wait for baxter to come riding in .
hell , charley , why don' t we just ride out to baxter' s ranch and go straight at him , too ?
well , i' il fight wherever you want , boss .
you just make the call .
god damn it .
now , hold on , charley .
hold on .
well , you asked me .
i told you .
charley , come on in out of the rain , would you ?
come on .
come on .
just getting testy in my old age .
sounds like it' s not such a bad idea .
just roll it around is all i ask .
all right .
what' d you think of my speech in there ?
liked it .
maybe i ought to run for mayor .
well , i believe officeholders got to be living , boss .
come to see about the boy .
he' s asleep .
but , please , come in .
are you sure , ma' am ?
we' re a mite rank .
we don' t want to mess your house .
no , no .
no , please , it' s all right .
come on in .
thank you , ma' am .
there you are .
i can' t get my fingers in .
we can' t get our big fat fingers in these holes .
too many broke knuckles .
oh , let me get you something bigger .
no , ma' am , we can make do .
no , no .
it' s all right .
it' s just nice to be sitting at a table set with fine china .
those were my mother' s .
they were the only things of hers that survived the trip out here .
i don' t know why i bring them out .
i can' t hold them , either .
guess it just makes me feel good .
i say what' s on my mind , good or bad .
i admire that .
try living with it .
see that ?
no need for a wife or home .
we' re just like a ... an old married couple .
so , is it marriage that scares you two or putting down roots ?
no .
who' d have him ?
all rangy and mangy like a rough old dog .
how about i hold your head underwater for just a little while ?
i married once .
never knowed that , did you , charley ?
had a wife and child .
sweet little spread , too .
it was nothing fancy , but we was young .
loved each other .
never had a cross word .
they caught the typhus and died .
and after that , home didn' t seem a place to spend time .
believe i' ve changed my mind on that now that i' m getting on in years .
lf button lives and we survive baxter ,
i swear i aim to see to it there' s a home he' s sleeping in instead of the cold prairie .
have yourself a last cup of tea , charley .
i' d like to see button again , miss barlow .
of course .
i know the way .
whew .
been riding with him 1 0 years .
never said nothing about being married .
where are you and mr. spearman spending the night ?
don' t rightly know .
it ... depends on circumstances .
you mean marshal poole ?
we have a spare room .
it' s yours if you want it .
couldn' t do that , ma' am .
we' d be putting you in a spot with the marshal and baxter .
besides , it' s a small town .
wouldn' t look right , particularly with the doc away .
i' il take those .
you know where they go ?
i saw .
thank you .
been raining like hell ever since we got here .
water washing right down main street .
charley saved a pup from being washed away .
looked a little like old tig .
now , if you can , you got to listen and pay attention .
' cause i got something important to say .
i ain' t been looking after you for you to go out this way .
the world ain' t a perfect place , button .
but you got unfinished business here .
so you come back , you hear me , now ?
you come back .
kind of dumb talking to him like that .
no .
no , it' s good .
you all right , mr. spearman ?
believe i' m as right as a man can be under the circumstances .
circumstances ?
that' s just what mr. waite called them .
i asked him to reconsider , and i' m asking you .
by " reconsider , " you mean tuck tail and run ?
i mean save your life and his .
he' il listen to you .
charley thinks for hisself , miss barlow .
he' s a good man , and he knows what has to be done .
i' il be paying you now for whatever else button needs .
ln case it goes bad for charley and me , maybe you and the doc will see we' re taken care of properly .
i' d like to put pen to paper if you have them .
yes .
of course .
mr. waite ?
look at my face .
oh !
sorry !
i' m sorry .
it' s all right , charley .
okay ?
it just be us .
it' s all right , charley .
it' s all right , charley .
it' s all right .
i' il get it .
jumpy is all .
she ought not to sneak up like that .
she weren' t sneaking .
i scared that woman half to death .
yeah .
scared me a little bit , too .
well , that' s how it is , boss .
ain' t a pretty picture .
got your wits about you now ?
yeah .
yeah .
it weren' t as bad as it looked .
i' il bet .
go !
hyah !
two whiskeys , barkeep .
barkeep !
two whiskeys .
you see that sign ?
around these parts , free grazers is the first .
now , he asked you twice .
ain' t gonna ask again .
hey , bill , it' s all right .
these are the fellows that saved my dog .
i couldn' t serve them if they saved jesus himself .
mr. baxter would have my job .
baxter the owner ?
that' s right .
give me a bottle .
i' il serve them myself .
you know i can' t do that .
now we' il have our drinks .
believe i' il have me another .
yes .
well , looks like the rain' s let up a bit .
well , if it don' t , there' il be trout fishing right on main street .
i' d like you to meet my boys .
ray and cory .
