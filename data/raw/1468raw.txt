the indians say the curse began in the time of the ancients , and was passed down through the blood of generations .
there are legends of the wendigo and the coming of the red and the black .
legends of the day of reckoning , when death would consume the land , and good would face evil ... of the day the curse would be broken forever ... or grow stronger and live on to plague generations to come .
but ours was a story of survival , of two sisters bound by blood ... a bond that would not be broken .
that was our promise above all .
above men , above god ... above fate .
it was in our blood .
together forever .
i' m so cold .
me too .
ginger , i think we' ve lost our way .
we haven' t lost anything , brigitte .
it' s lost us .
easy .
shh .
come on .
come on !
fine then .
we' il all walk .
come on .
let' s go .
hello ?
ginger .
are you all right ?
what happened here ?
my sister ... gone .
many summers ... in the wind , in the trees and in the blood .
sisters .
they were hers and her sister' s .
thank you .
say " thank you , " ginger .
thank you .
kill the boy ... ... or one sister kills the other .
whoa , whoa , whoa .
easy , easy , easy !
what' s wrong with him ?
it' s all right .
ginger !
no , come back !
come back !
come back !
brigitte !
get it off me !
i can' t !
i' m gonna go back to the camp and try and find the old woman .
don' t leave me !
look at me .
count to 100 , and before you do , i' il be back .
all right ?
one , two ...
three ...
four ... five ... six , seven , eight , nine , 10 , 11 ...
50 .
ginger !
55 , 56 ...
help !
please , somebody !
help us !
brigitte !
ginger .
98 , 99 ...
i' m not alone !
i' m counting !
100 .
you stay away from her , you son of a bitch !
you all right ?
did he just whistle at us ?
i' m sure he meant the dog .
son ...
welcome to civilization .
cormac !
do these two look like anyone you' ve ever laid eyes on , other than while you were off pulling in some shithouse somewhere ?
answer me !
we don' t ever open the gate for anyone we don' t know .
do we ?
you bloody idiot .
it' s nearly nightfall ... we were looking for shelter .
here we never talk out of turn , and while i' m spitting , it is always my turn .
but i see it is not the first time your mouth has made you trouble , is it ?
sergeant major , stand down .
mr. rowlands .
the dark one' s hurt .
show me .
she' s been bit .
how' d you come by that wound ?
in the woods .
i stepped in a trap , and the indian helped us .
we were accompanying our father montgomery fitzgerald on his commission to find a pass through the mountains west , only our boat was overturned .
we washed up on shore , but our ... our parents were drowned .
cast them out , wallace .
cast them out .
you put us all in grave peril if you give them refuge .
mark me , wallace .
you' ve been marked .
let' s let doc murphy see to it .
our parents drowned ?
yes , but they didn' t suffer .
it was really quite peaceful .
you' il have an ugly scar , but you' il keep the foot ... if we make sure it doesn' t turn septic .
these ... ugly black bastards , they like the blood .
oh god , no !
but they' il settle for the sickness .
she doesn' t want them on her .
it' s a necessary evil .
my name is wallace rowlands .
i am chief factor at fort bailey .
and tonight , since you are our guests , dinner will be in the company hall .
ladies , mr. murphy .
do you feel that ?
good .
be thankful .
it means you' re alive .
i' il get you something for the pain .
i really don' t have much to spare but ...
is it medicinal ?
not in the least .
ginger ?
i' m right here .
ah , enjoy it while it lasts , girl .
mr. murphy , those graves out there ... is it the pox ?
no , it' s not .
your fort' s nearly abandoned .
most of the people have gone home .
the rest aren' t sleeping too good .
what is everyone so afraid of ?
didn' t you see them ... out there in the woods ?
we saw nothing .
not to worry , girl ... because they saw you .
it' s good to have guests in the main house again .
you will find it more comfortable than your travels in the woods .
we passed an indian camp on the way .
it looked like it had been attacked .
oh ?
hmm .
have war parties been raiding you ?
is that what' s happened here ?
the damp in this place , it gets evil cold in the bones .
the indians told the company this was a bad place to build a fort , but they didn' t listen .
so where is everyone ?
the trade party was supposed to return with supplies two months ago .
it' s two months ... and still no sign of them .
so there' s no passage east then ?
except on foot .
for a few thousand miles .
this was geoffrey' s room .
wallace' s son .
where is he ?
he died ... a few weeks ago .
these are for you .
i hope they fit all right .
they were wallace' s wife' s .
she was a beautiful indian girl .
she died too .
it was quite tragic .
here' s the key .
i' il see you at dinner then .
hmm .
what a lovely shade of dead .
is a dead boy' s room the only one they' ve got ?
it' s better than sleeping in the woods with a tree root for a pillow .
we' ve slept there before .
together forever ?
together forever .
ladies .
we should eat here more often .
there' s two chairs for you here .
chief factor , the blessing .
yes , of course .
it wouldn' t be dinner if the almighty didn' t join us .
bless us , father , for these thy gifts of plenty which we are about to receive .
and verily ... verily i say unto thee ,
let us not succumb to the temptations of the flesh , but rather remain chaste .
the faithful shall kneel on bleeding shins ...
amen .
amen .
scripture has twisted that man deadly .
and you ... you watch it .
he' s fixing on you .
enjoy it while it lasts .
there won' t be much more for any of us soon .
supplies will get through .
we just to have hold out until then .
i wanna make a toast ... a toast to our magnificent indian friend here .
we had scouts like you in my regiment out east ... yes , which was a good thing .
' cause in the front line they took a musket ball
like a sandbag .
seven footer , good 300 lbs .
on him ...
wallace does good to keep him here .
hunter like him could kill anywhere .
what keeps him here ?
something he' s not telling .
no , you' re waiting for something .
what is it ?
got some kind of blood brothers out there ?
they work us from the outside and you , redskin , work us from the inside ?
easy , easy !
easy .
put it away ...
i am my own .
i stay because it is my will to stay .
and until they get you ... remember that it was a redskin' s will that you even breathed your stink that long .
gentlemen .
we stand on the brink of darkness ... and the color of our gods has nothing whatsoever to do with it .
we have to abandon this place .
the company will understand .
they' re just wooden walls .
wooden walls ?
every man that has ever walked on this mortal earth ... has walked here with us .
and we stand as far as they' ve ever come .
it' s these wooden walls that shelter every rome ever built .
this battle' s every war ever won .
and that fire out there ... every light that' s held back the dark .
dinner is over .
good christian women need fear nothing .
we' re not afraid .
oh yes , you are .
two months this fort has been in the devil' s grip , and you two little girls walk right through our door .
what is that ?
demons .
the devil' s wickedness .
this place is to be drowned like a newborn deformity , to be cut out like a bleeding cancer , to be cast into hell like a stinking whore !
don' t forget to say your prayers , ladies .
these people are fucked .
ginger , come look at this .
these toys must be geoffrey' s .
who' s there ?
hello ?
hello ?
come over here .
i' m not going to hurt you .
wake up .
brigitte , wake up .
get dressed .
we' re leaving .
i was dreaming ...
mother and father were there .
mother and father are dead .
you' re bleeding .
what have you done ?
what have i done ?
something bit me !
something bit you ?
yes .
i thought it was a boy .
it was some kind of animal ... it was deformed .
it' s loose in the house .
brigitte , please get up .
where are we going to go ?
same place we always go ... away .
stop .
did you hear that ?
help me .
ah , come here .
get up ... so i can rattle your pretty mouth again .
oh , you' re gonna do just fine .
come on .
come on .
don' t move .
step back .
do it .
she won' t .
i won' t ?
no , you won' t .
you may have the gun , but you don' t have the stones .
owen , finn !
get down here !
they' re on top of us !
we' re coming !
help me !
owen !
tabarnac !
oliver !
don' t let me go , finn !
don' t let me go !

seamus !

en nomini patri , et fili , et spiritus sancti ...
burn in hell .
it' s in here with us .
be quiet .
run .
run !
close the door !
close the door !
break the window , brigitte !
go away !
help up here !
somebody help us !
you bastard .
what are you two girls doing out of your room ?
are you all right ?
no .
your " man of god " locked us in with one of those things !
monsieur rowlands !
we need more men on the walls .
how many are there ?
they' re everywhere .
up the tower ... shoot whatever you see .
reverend , be useful !
stand a post .
he tried to kill us .
you two , to your room !
it has begun .
the black and the red .
what is it ?
oh shit .
oh god .
i' m burning up .
just leave it .
it' s fine .
i' ve bled before .
not without being hit .
what are they , ginger ?
animals ?
that was no animal .
could they really be ...
what , demons come for us sinners ?
it looks septic .
they' ve got the place surrounded .
god help us !
brigitte ?
brigitte ?
hmm .
what have you done to my sister ?
what will you do to your sister ?
thank you .
one sister kills the other ...
brigitte ?
brigitte !
oh god .
we need to see dr. murphy .
the air is bloody .
kill the boy .
mr. murphy ?
we need you to ...
what' s the matter , finn ?
uh , nothing .
i' m fine .
shh !
it' s just these leeches .
they can' t be trusted .
go on .
answer the girl , finn .
tell her what you' re doing .
me ?
i' m ... just killing these leeches here .
you got bit last night , didn' t you , finn ?
no .
no , i didn' t .
i did real good last night .
i' m sure i ... shot the one that took owen , and i' m real sure ... not one of them even ... so much as touched me .
you know me , murphy .
i' m fit as a fiddle most of the time .
i know , finn .
you' re a real good boy .
but you gotta listen to me now .
put the knife down .
now , get yourself a leech .
do it , boy .
now put it on you .
do it , finn .
no , not on your arm .
on your chest .
please , murphy .
i just wanna go home .
yeah , me too , son .
we' re almost there .
get me out of here .
now , what can i do for you two ladies ?
what the hell' s going on , murph ?
finn got bit .
i put him down .
we can' t keep doing this !
he was no damn sick dog .
he was bit .
and when they' re bit , they turn .
just like this one here did .
wait a minute .
that' s jean pierre' s mark , isn' t it , claude ?
no , you' re wrong .
it' s not my brother' s .
it' s the same mark .
it' s what happened to the boat crew .
it' s them turned .
no , tab !
it' s him .
who is jean pierre ?
jean pierre is claude' s brother , head of the boat crew .
they were supposed to return with provisions two months ago .
they left in the spring , and they haven' t come back .
there' s been no sign of them .
we need to know .
you need to know .
check the eye .
angels and ministers of grace defend us .
glass .
it' s him .
they' re all dead .
or turned into these sieging monsters .
what' s more ...
jean pierre used to bunk up there where the hunter killed him .
it' s the last thing they remember ... trying to come home .
it is time for us to confess our sins ... beg for his mercy .
and what good will that do us ?
can you not see we' re reaping what we' ve sown ?
we' ve brought this upon ourselves .
i' m sure i' m going to hell for this , but shut your holy fucking mouth .
that' s it .
we pack up , we get the hell out of here .
we move at night .
we rest during the day .
if the hunter leads us ...
no savage is leading me anywhere .
you don' t have to come .
i' m sick of your bile !
you' re the one fathering their whelps .
i' m going to rip your filthy tongue out of your skull !
seamus !
none of it makes any difference .
the hunter to guide us , we' il be taking down him with us .
we' ve no choice , do you understand ?
come on , ginger .
this is the fight !
and if it' s to be fought here , then so be it .
i' ve lost my wife to it .
i' ve lost my son to it .
let them come .
he' s lying to them .
his son' s not dead .
that was him that bit me .
he' s still lives in the house .
he' s turning into one of those creatures .
so am i.
no ...
i can smell their blood .
yours too .
be quiet .
stop , just stop .
shh .
oh god .
when we were boys in france , my grandfather told my brother and i of le loup garou ... man transformed into wolf .
on the full moon , it preyed on the shepherds ... and travelers near his village .
the old men warned us ... beware its bite , or we might become a slave to the full moon too .
it gave me bad dreams ...
but my brother said ,
don' t worry , claude , if it bites you , you won' t become one .
because i will help you catch it , so you can kill it before you turn ... and the spell will be broken .
it was a long time ago ... and we were just little boys .
god' s forgiveness and mercy for his children is boundless .
those lost in battle with evil shall find glory in the fields of heaven .
he has brought peace and eternal rest upon the souls of finn mclntyre and owen crisp .
but verily i say unto thee , those that court sin shall be lost to the fire .
they shall become the very armies of the beast .
no longer can we flout god .
no longer can we give refuge to the evil amongst us .
no longer can we cast our seed into the dusky heathen bitch .
for he who was cast down into the fire is upon us , and his name is legion for he is many !
come on , boy .
i can' t find my mother .
i' ve looked and looked .
i miss mine too .
it itches .
geoffrey , wait .
your end .
lift .
okay .
let me look at it .
how is it ?
it' s fine .
it' s getting better .
i' m going to get something for the pain .
there' s nothing you can do .
brigitte , where' s your sister ?
resting .
the excitement ... she can sometimes be a little ... frail .
she' s all right ?
she let geoffrey out .
the others don' t know he' s alive .
you saw them out there .
they' d kill him .
what happened to him ?
my wife and he were attacked .
she was killed .
he had been bitten .
for a while it seemed he might recover .
but then he began to change into one of them .
every day i look into his eyes and i see less and less my little boy .
can you imagine what that' s like ?
you look after your sister .
geoffrey ?
kill the boy .
that was the boy who bit me .
i have to kill him ...
if i ... if i kill him ... just like she said ,
i kill the boy and the curse' il be lifted .
milo ?
milo ?
seamus ?
seamus ?
it was just here .
jesus christ .
i' ve got something for you .
you can wear it in a locket .
hmm ...
quiet !
okay , get her out !
get her out of here !
quiet !
oww !
it isn' t a wolf bite , is it ?
no ...
get a good bite , little bitch .
good and deep .
ahh ...
oh god !
no !
oh god !
stand away from the girl .
now get out .
mr. rowlands .
i' il get you , boy .
they' re going to kill my sister .
geoffrey bit her , didn' t he ?
she' s turning .
yes .
then it' s too late .
is it too late for your son ?
i' il tell them about geoffrey .
i swear it .
they kill my sister , they kill your son .
hold her still !
get a leech .
let her go !
you heard her .
let her go .
she killed seamus !
bled out his throat .
she never left the room .
i swear it !
she never left her sister' s side .
leech the witch !
reverend ...
i suggest you lower your weapon , or i will , by god , introduce you to him .
this plague has come because of your love for your savage wife .
it is your sin that has brought the devil upon us .
my sin is something you can only dream about .
leech her .
it' s the only way we' re gonna know .
murphy , don' t .
you' re insane .
no one touches either of these two without my order .
is that understood ?
get out !
it' s all right .
it' s all right .
pack your things .
you' re making us leave ?
not you .
you can stay .
she goes .
brigitte , i have to break the curse .
we go ... we go together .
i have to kill geoffrey .
i' m not staying here without you .
there' s no other way .
he must die by my hand .
i don' t know where we' il go , but we' il go together .
brigitte , look at me .
there' s got to be something .
some other way , something we don' t know about .
brigitte , look at me !
i' m turning into something dangerous .
you know it' s true .
you heard the old woman .
you' re the only thing i have .
nothing else .
i will not kill you .
forever ... nothing else .
i love you , brigitte .
no !
no !
no , no !
no one left to protect you , little half breed .
your father' s throat' s out !
let me go !
get the gate !
you' re going out , like the dirty little mongrel mutt you are !
no !
please no !
get up !
get out !
get the beam .
geoffrey ?
shh , it' s all right .
you miss her , don' t you ?
i' m sure she misses you too .
there' s something in the graveyard !
run !
where is she ?
she' s gone .
it' s too dangerous for you here .
what do you want ?
i' ve known you before i found you in the woods .
since i was a boy , i' ve seen your face in dreams .
i' ve prepared my whole life to meet with you .
the dreams told me to protect you .
and kill my sister .
if i wanted to kill either of you ,
i could' ve , many times .
i am forbidden to kill her .
the seer believes our fates are tied together .
you know the old woman ?
she' s an elder with sight .
come with me and she will show us the truth .
i' m waiting for my sister .
she' s one of them .
i' ve hunted this creature' s bloodline for years .
they live only to kill !
i' m staying until my sister comes back .
watch her carefully .
soon not even her love for you will stop her .
wallace !
wallace !
they found the boy .
what is that ?
it' s wallace' s boy .
he' s alive .
and he' s turned .
turned ugly .
wallace come out here .
having a little reunion .
wallace , get out here !
wallace !
good news , chief .
your boy' s back from the dead .
you' ve been telling us lies !
he' s my son , he' s my responsibility .
he' s not your son anymore .
look at him !
you fucked us .
you haven' t just killed murphy .
you killed everyone here .
it' s my concern .
what about murphy' s concern ?
and owen' s ?
and finn' s ?
he killed seamus .
for good or bad , i' m in command !
well , i think it' s time that changed .
son ...
look at me .
take him !
no !
i couldn' t do it , brigitte .
i couldn' t kill him , now it' s too late .
i' m afraid , brigitte .
it' s over .
mutiny' s over .
and that one ?
she' s leaving .
we two owe each other nothing .
say your goodbyes .
we have to find the old woman .
we' il take our chances and travel by day in the woods .
it' s better than staying here .
we wait until the watch changes , and then we go out the way the beast got in .
by the time they come for you , we' il already be gone .
keep pulling !
therefore the curse is brought upon us .
i' m cold .
i' m not .
we have to keep moving .
ginger !
we have to find the hunter .
he' il take us to the seer ...
shhh , shh .
what is it ?
someone' s watching us .
hello ?
milo .
i know you' re afraid , but can you help us find the hunter ?
his cave is up the river .
take us to him .
can you do that ?
we' re very close .
what do you hear ?
they' re stalking us .
wendigo .
this way , hurry !
milo , wait !
milo ?
milo ?
ginger ?
ginger ?
brigitte , i couldn' t help it .
i did it .
you need to leave me .
come on , come on .
brigitte ...
i' il kill you .
i' il kill you .
come on , ginger , up !
there ... the cave .
that' s the place .
shh , it' s all right .
no , it' s over .
it' s over , we' re dead .
we' re dead .
we' re not dead , we' re here .
we' ve come this far .
in my mother ...
i heard you coming .
tell us how to cure this .
i warned you .
it' s too late .
the curse is in the blood .
kill the boy before he bit you .
please help us .
tell us what to do .
the english and the french brought with them their diseases to plague our land .
and with them came the wendigo .
this was all foretold , watched for .
and with the wendigo would come two sisters , the red and the black .
and their love and their deaths would decide the way of things .
i' m gonna kill you , brigitte .
no , you won' t .
she won' t kill me ,
i know it .
snow .
she is offering you " machya buwat moon .
the night and the day come into you and your spirit runs forward .
you will see things .
will i see what happens to us ?
you will see your death .
but will i find the answer ?
snow .
don' t do this , brigitte .
i need to know .
it is believed amongst our people that those who lived always live .
do not fear death .
i love you , brigitte .
gin gerr !
no !
ginger !
ginger ?
what happened ?
she killed the seer .
i went in to protect you and she ripped out her throat .
now tell me what you saw .
tell me !
i didn' t see my death .
i saw ginger' s .
and it was you that killed her , wasn' t it ?
it' s what i saw .
and what did you see ?
i saw myself die .
i give my life to save you ... so that you can kill her .
it' s still her .
we will be together .
she will come back to me .
she has to die by your hand .
and what if i don' t ?
what if i don' t kill her ?
she dies by your hands , or you die by hers and the land suffers forever as foretold .
i just want my sister back .
you saw this knife .
i know you saw it .
i killed ginger with it .
this is the only way .
you have no choice .
it is your path .
do not fear death .
we go to the fort and wait for her .
she will come for you there .
the prodigal has returned .
welcome back .
you bastard !
in this mortal life , it is not just our physical bodies which hang in the balance .
it is an eternity of peace , and it is this forgiveness which i offer you .
take it , child .
for the lost soul of your sister , take it .
i have seen things ... in dreams and in waking ... about the way things will be for her and i.
and in these dreams , reverend ... you are screaming for your life , you prick !
she' s coming for me .
witch !
temptress !
one , two ...
disciple of the devil !
no longer will your evil tempt us . three ... four , five ...
if you will not beg for mercy , mercy shall be inflicted upon you .
wait !
the other will come .
let the bitch in .
you were born of the fire ...
37 ... and to the fire you shall return .
i' ve come for my sister .
i' m sorry to tell you , but the reverend has taken a real fancy to saving her from hellfire .
so i guess that leaves me and you more or less to ourselves .
right then .
burn her , wallace , while there' s still time .
burn her !
you hit like a girl .
well , we' ve got all night to fix that .
you' ve let a pair of little girls destroy us .
you never could see how they lied and tricked and tempted you into oblivion , man , just like that bitch wife of yours .
forgive me , father ... for i have sinned .
48 ...
have you had enough ?
huh ?
you finished yet ?
or does your pretty little mouth have something more to say ?
let' s hear it !
come closer .
it' s a secret .
watch her !
68 ...
she' s come back for you .
stay close to the fire .
98 ...
99 ...
100 .
ginger ?
behind you !
you know how it must end .
together forever .
ginger !
i was wrong to leave you , brigitte .
but you came back .
ginger ?
i' m cold .
i' m not .
the day of reckoning ... the day the curse grew stronger in the red and the black .
sisters united in blood , together forever .
