<i>[ paul ] </ i>
<i>what abortion ? </ i>
<i>what abortion , mary ? </ i>
i can explain .
explain what ?
there is an explanation .
uh huh .
all that drama about artificial insemination .
kids ' names .
you got pictures of our friends ' babies all over the place .
why ?
so you can flush it down the fuckin ' toilet ?
we' ve been a fraud for a long time , mary .
oh , yeah ?
why didn' t you tell me that when you were sick , huh ?
or did you expect one of your girlfriends to come and take care of you ?
you came back because you wanted to .
don' t blame me for that .
i came back to take care of you because i love you .
or because you were feeling lonely .
i' m sorry .
i' m sorry .
i can' t keep going like this .
the insemination , the child .
it' s like we' re trying to put a band aid on something that' s just been bled dry .
it' s finished .
but it ... it isn' t finished if we give it a chance and have this baby .
when we could have , you didn' t want to .
we were separated , goddamn it !
it' s different now !
yes , it' s different .
we gonna go ?
you only know how to think about yourself .

well , thanks for finally seeing me .

jack , jesus didn' t come to free us from pain .
he came to give us the strength to bear it .
maybe he wanted this pain for me .
<i>no , he had nothing</ i> <i>to do with this . </ i>
<i>it was an accident . </ i>
no , it wasn' t an accident .
jesus chose me for this .
jack , ask for the mercy ofjesus christ .
if it was an accident , why do i have to ask for his mercy ?
i will have mercy on whom i will have mercy .
i will have compassion on whom i will have compassion .
don' t be so prideful .
that' s a sin .
" and the fearful and unbelieving .
and the abominable , the murderers , the warmongers , <i>jack , listen to me . </ i>

jesus came to save us , not to damn us .
<i>" shall have their part ... </ i> in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone .
revelation 21 : 8 .
<i>jesus , loves you . </ i>
but he also knows how to punish arrogant sinners like you .
as many as i love , i rebuke and chaste .

jesus betrayed me .
<i>stop this shit , or you' re</ i> <i>going straight to hell ! </ i>
hell ?
this is hell .
right here !
<i>you' re damning your soul ! </ i>
<i>you shut up now ... </ i> <i>and ask christ</ i> <i>to forgive you ! </ i>
hey !
forgive me ?
i did everything he asked me to do !
i changed !
<i>i gave him my life, </ i> <i>and he betrayed me . </ i>
he put that fucking truck in my hand so i could carry out his will .
made me kill that man and those girls .
but hey , he didn' t give me the strength to stay and save them .
don' t blaspheme , you bastard !
christ had nothing to do with this !
