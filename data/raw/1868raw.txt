how i miss scotland ... and the sea the sea .
there' s nothing like it in all the earth the salt in your face , the wind atyour back ... and all the world before you .
andyou' re freer than a bird in the air or a fish in the ocean .
to be free
i reckon that' s why i joined the second war to end all wars .
i was at the university studying to be a teacher when the call to arms occurred .
i was only too eager to put aside my studies for the glory of action .
i stopped reading history and became a part ofit .
i joined the proud ranks of the argyil & sutherland highlanders ... and became captain ernest gordon .
my commanding offiicer was lieutenant colonel stuart mclean , the finest commander the 93rd battalion ever had ; a man ofdeep loyalties to his country , his duty and his men ; a loyalty that was soon to be matched by his own second in command ,
major ian campbell , a man ofpassionate devotion to the colonel as well as the cause .
and it was our loyalties that would eventually be tested .
the argyils had a legacy or being the last line ofdefense , and we were to prove that legacy once again ... in the face ofdefeat ... and capture by the enemy .
sir !
sir !
you all right , sir ?
you look the devil in the face with pride , boys !
and try not shit your kilts .
bastards are just playing with our minds .
when you surrender in war , you' re stripped ofyour dignity as a soldier .
all you' ve got left is your fellow comrades , many ofwhom you' ve just met .
lieutenant jim reardon , merchant marine , one ofthe few americans in the area .
attached himselfto the argyils during the allied surrender .
we called him " yanker , " ' cause he was both an american ...
and a bit ofa wanker .
parade , halt .
what' s that stench ? .
that' il be death , major .
sir !!
parade , right wheel .
parade , halt .
left turn .
standat ease .
stand easy .
what the hell does " tenko " mean ? .
must be roll call .
today , you will count off in english .
but tomorrow and forever , in japanese .
start counting !
one !
two !
three !!
four !!
five .
six .
big eared nip .
bastard .
this is a shame culture .
you make ' em lose face , you' il pay .
stand easy .
this is an outrage !!
i am a senior officer , and i will not tolerate this barbaric behavior !
this man has rights !
dirty
attention , prisoners .
you are now captives ... of his imperial majesty , the emperor .
behold the extreme penalty for those who try to escape .
this is foryour own sake .
you will sign these papers promising not to escape .
no escape , myyankee ass .
this is against the geneva convention .
they don' t give two shits about the geneva convention .
tomorrow , you will bring these signedpapers from all prisoners .
you are dismissed .
go .
go !
what did you just say ? .
i told him you were stupid .
don' t know whether to thankyou or kickyour ass .
ian campbell .
dusty miller .
where' d you learn to speakjapanese ? .
what with the colonel ? .
you wantyour colonel back ? .
owe the man my life .
the more hair , the more lice .
ow !
a word of advice stay close toyour cobbers .
but when it comes right down to it , it' s survival ofthe fittest .
every man for himself .
barter is the name ofthe game , gents .
they call the hospital the death house .
you don' t want to end up in here .
relish your health now , gentlemen .
it' s the lastyou' il see ofit .
there are thousands more prisoners in camps all along the river .
not too much skinny here from the outside .
japs keep us in the dark .
no radios .
they catch one , they' il kill you .
officers , try to keep your shirt on .
it' il distinguish you from the grunts , which is about the only thing ... that' s keeping us from degenerating into a bloody anarchy .
oh , shit .
ernie , whereya goin ' ? .
to find out about the colonel .
you' re just askin ' for trouble !
doc .
get him down here .
come on .
easy .
easy .
it' s my back .
my back , my back .
eh .
what the bloody hell happened ? .
looks like you didn' t bow .
what ? .
always bow before a guard , korean orjap .
never look ' em in the eyes when they pass you .
that' s pure defiance .
always look away .
rules of bushido .
bushido ? .
their kind of chivalry .
respect and obligation .
ifyou don' t respect them , they feel obligated to bash you .
nothing personal .
well , it sure as bloodywell feels personal .
yeah , well , it works both ways .
they do the same to their own .
that' s a comfort .
now listen .
you must understand , these monsters truly believe we' re an inferior race less than human .
now , beating a prisoner to them is like beating a disobedient dog , and the fiercer the beating , the fiercer their dedication to the emperor .
you' il be all right , son .
make space for the colonel .
you' re buggers forpunishment, you lot .
you should' ve let ' em take me instead , sir .
anything we can do foryou , colonel ? .
ah .
start preparing .
preparing forwhat ? .
escape .
heh !
what else , you towheaded yank ? .
dusty .
thankyou .
colonel , i' ve been watching these nips .
there' s never more than a handful ofthem ... guarding the perimeter at any given time , and they' re not watching very closely .
itjust doesn' t make sense to me unless  unless what ? .
unless every prisoner' s been caught or died in a thousand miles ofhostile jungle .
unless the local villagers are willing to turn in a p. o. w. for a bowl ofrice .
unless escape is impossible .
excellent .
yanker .
you find the best escape route , hmm ? .
ian .
yes , sir .
you should start getting survival gear together , hmm ? .
ernest , get things together .
we can trade with the locals .
yes , sir .
and as soon as i' m well , we' re on ourway .
yes , sir .
yes , sir .
okay ?
good .
sir .
good boys .
they' re good boys .
that' s myboys .
hey .
how about some extra for my colonel ? .
he' s in the death house .
ifyour colonel can' t make it , it means he can' t work .
ifhe can' t work , he can' t eat .
nip rules .
move along .
come on , pal .
i' il oweyou one .
hey , you heard him .
he said , move along !
you look like a sheep humping highlander !
come on !
yeah !
do it !
what areyou , bloodychicken ?
i' il kickyourass !
come on , you english fuck !
well , come on , then , wanker !
well , come on !
it' s enough .
what does it take for a man to lose his dignity ?
come on , you english fuck !
how far can he fall to pay the price ofsurvival ?
dusty built a sanctuaryjust outside the camp called the church without walls .
we were allowed to visit it freely .
they knew we had nowhere to go .
i' il tellyou what i' m gonna do soon as i get back to glasgow .
gonna visit my favorite pub .
i' m gonna sink ... 1 4 whiskeys and seven pints .
and i ' m gonna spend the night in the arms of my tender , lovin ' wee wife .
you' re married , sir ? .
no , but ifyou got a sister , i' m available .
what aboutyou , ernie ? .
probably teach .
i' ve always fancied teaching .
i thought i' d see the world first though .
you got that wish .
aye .
when i get outta here , i' m gonna go into business for myself and get stinkin ' rich .
what kind ofbusiness ? .
black market .
prostitution .
i' il tell ya what , mate .
you' re not gonna make much money as a prostitute , i' il tell you that .
what aboutyou , sir ?
what areyou gonna do after the war ? .
start preparing for the next war .
in the bushido code , the nation is everything .
the individual is nothing .
conformity is how they gain their sense ofpurpose , and they expected us to fall in line as well .
what are we sayi ng , dusty ? .
loyalty , politeness , frugality .
soldier' s duty .
well , isn' t that just dandy .
carry on , sergeant major .
parade !
parade tion !
about face .
all show respect for honorable lieutenant colonel nagatomo ,
chief ofthailand p. o. w. administration .
i think she fancies me .
it is great pleasure for me ... to see you at this place .
you are few remaining skeleton ... of ourvictory and our pitiful victim .
youshould weep with gratitude ... at his imperial majesty , the emperor , who pityyou for being coward !
what' s he talking about , cowards ? .
rules of bushido .
they believe the losers should kill themselves .
you will give me greatpleasure ... to build a railroad ... through the jungle to the glory of his imperial majesty , the emperor , saviour ofjapan !
saviour of asia !
we willbuild this railroad ... ifwe have to build it over the white man' s body .
it is your purification .
hmm .
railroad to be 420 kilometer , from chungkai base camp to ...
thanbyuzayat in north .
you will build the railroad in 18 months .
eighteen months ? .
how will my men manage that on the rations you' re feeding them , hmm ?
officers work as well .
royal engineer will oversee building .
where are the signed papers ?
gentlemen , as you have violated the geneva convention , the hague convention ... and every human right for properly supervised prisoners of war , mayl respectfullyrecommend ... thatyou ... and your fascist monkeys ... stickyourhead upyourass !
because we will not sign your bloody paper !
now translate that !
i am sick of this drivel !
gentlemen .
sir .
look after my boys , ian .
it is regrettable , but ... we take each ofyou andshoot one by one !
come on , man .
sir !
until you respect emperor !
come on .
out of here .
out of here !
fuck !
fuck him !
come on !
come on , man !
come on !
fuck !
come on , man !
out ofhere !
bastard !
fucking bastard !
out , out ofhere !
fucking  come .
major , what happened ? .
what happened ?
fucking shot !
where' s the  fucking fucking shot !
it' s the colonel' s blood .
it' s the colonel' s blood !
fuckingshot him !
the bastard !
major .
major , the colonel !
you fucking slanted eyed
don' t let him go !
campbell !
don' t be another !
enough is enough !
fucking bastard !
there' s nothing you can do .
there' s nothing you can do .
how can he die ?
what are we gonna do ?
it' s all right .
what the fuck are we gonna do now ?
shh !
what the fuck are we gonna do now ?
just stay down , major .
verily , verily , i say unto you , " except a corn ofwheat fall into the ground and die , " it abideth alone . " but if it die , it bringeth forth much fruit .
there is suffering before glory .
there is a cross ... before the crown .
outward , turn !
slow , march !
cheers .
i' m not leaving .
what ?
i said , i' m not leaving .
what about our plan ?
i owed the colonel my life .
and i watched him die in front of my eyes , and i just stood there doing nothing .
you thinkyou' re the only one suffering here ? .
you thinkyou' re the only one  now waken up !
there' s a reason why every escape has failed , and there' s a reason why thejaps don' t give a toss about security .
we were fools to think we even stood a chance .
i' ve got my own plans now .
you are a selfish bastard .
come on , ernie .
ernie !
fine !
yanker , wait a minute !
yanker , wait !
you' il never make it on your own in that jungle .
it' s suicide !
take a look around you !
take a look in the eyes ofthese men .
you tell me whatyou see .
that' s right , ernie .
they' re dead already .
you know it , and i know it .
everybody in there does , too , except they' re afraid to admit the obvious , and that scares the fuckin ' hell out of me !
because at least with escape ... it gave us one thing hope .
hope , ernie .
because without that , we might as well be sitting in there ... with our thumbs up our asses waitin ' for the end to come !
is that whatyou want ? .
let me tell you something about me .
i am not a stupid man , and i am not a kamikaze .
ifl can' t escape , i' il do the next best thing .
i will take care of myself .
and that' s exactly what i plan on doing .
yanker !
we are all in this , all of us together !
sure , kid .
every single one of us .
the japanese were preparing to invade india .
the railway would be their supply line .
we would be the means to their end .
when you' re living to die , every minute is an eternity .
days are lost .
months blend into one another .
and the only realityyou know is in the moment , and the moment hangs over you like death .
it' s diffiicult to describe what it' s like to live with permanent hunger in your belly , and the stench ofdisease and death all aroundyou with every breath you take .
malaria , diphtheria , pellagra , dysentery ... sucks every ounce offluid right out ofyour body .
your muscles cramp up andyour circulation collapses .
major !
he' s burni ng up .
ernie .
i don' t know anybody who could survive that lot .
oh , ernie , son .
you are a good soldier ... and a good friend .
so this is death .
dark .
cold .
all alone .
no more reason to fight , so they give up on you .
in death there is no secondchance .
so that' s what you think about when you' re dying the real value of all that you' ve done with your life , andall thatyou might have done ... if only you' d had a second chance .
aah !
bloody hell !
these nip bastards are eatin ' like the prince of wales !
life doesn' t wait forthe individual , especiallylife as a prisoner ofwar .
ifyou want to survive , you need a bit ofluck , a quick wit and a mate to pickyou up when you fall .
where am i ?
you' ve been unconscious for days .
i thought if i could get you out of the death house and into some fresh air , you' d have a better chance of surviving .
well , i don' t know if i want to survive anymore .
open up .
how did you get the food away from the line ? .
i have my connections .
come on .
open up .
why areyou doing this ? .
hey , ernie .
uh , me and the cobbers , we' ve been chewing it over , and , uh , we got thinking .
what' s the purpose in what we been suffering ? .
i mean , where' s thejustice in in nips bashing us and working us to death ? .
and what' s worse , we' re killing each other to save our own skins .
what exactly are you asking me ? .
you said you wanted to be a teacher .
yeah .
we thought thatyou might have some answers , sir .
would you like me to ... take a lecture on the meaning oflife ? .
oh , that' s a bloody fine idea , sir !
please , just leave me alone .
that' s what i figured .
you know , a man can experience an incredible amount of pain and suffering ifhe has hope .
when he loses his hope , that' s when he dies .
all right .
uuh .
shit , i gotta take a shit .
come on .
reardon managed to make a connection to the local thai black market .
lemme see .
get outta here !
he wouldn' t share it with the others ... for fear ofbeing discovered by the nips .
at least , that' s what he told us .
good god , yanker , that' s stinking !
ri ght there , major cam pbel i , this is the scent of happiness .
nectar of the gods .
our ticket to numbness .
fermented rice alcohol .
this one' s on the house .
yeah ?
bastard .
he' s done it .
course i' ve done it .
oh , nice one , yanker .
let' s have a swig .
whoa , whoa , gentlemen .
you want charity , go to church .
as for me , i' m bartering my way to happiness .
so pony up with some cash .
anything you got .
don' t be shy .
line starts right here .
two cigarettes .
you' ve gotta get out of this rain .
come on .
walk !
ernie , you bastard !
you' re still alive !
hey , lazarus !
back from the dead , my son .
well , i kinda wish i' d stayed there , sir .
bollocks , soldier .
we need you alive .
hey !
come on .
what' s wrong ?
he hasn' t eaten .
he' s been able to get me extra rations .
he never got you extra rations , ernie .
he was giving you his .
help me with his legs .
i learned that while dusty was taking care of me , the major was preparing his own plans .
just what ,
i couldn' t tell .
no , no .
where did you get the food ?
multi ple anonymous donors .
eat .
i ' ve decided to start school for the jocks .
a jungle university .
i already made my own blackboard .
yankerrustledme up a textbook , for no small price .
first class is this evening .
i' ve got six students already .
i know it' s small , but , em , it' s a start .
i don' t want to be the skeptic here , ernie , but how in the hell doyou expect to engage in a group activity ... without the nips seeing you ? .
in the one place that the nips will never go near .
this stench is intolerable .
shutyour cake hole !
we' re doing the best we can .
get used to it !
right , lads .
eh , makeyourselfas comfortable as you can , andlet' s getstarted , eh ?
i' d like to speak toyou about plato .
um
all right .
what ...
is justice ?
excuse me , sir .
sir .
is it true you' re giving educational classes ?
mm hmm .
we' d like to help teach .
well , what' s your story ? .
roger primrose , trained in the fine arts .
lieutenant foxworth here used to teach shakespeare at cambridge .
i' m his platoon sergeant .
poor blighter' s at a loss without his books and the bard .
i figure ifl can keep him busy long enough , he won' t end up killing himself .
i' m ... notjoking , sir .
well , unfortunately , we don' t have any shakespeare .
to die , to sleep no more and by a sleep to say we end the heartache ... and the thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to .
' tis a consummation devoutly to be wished .
to die , to sleep to sleep , perchance to dream .
ay , there' s the rub , for in that sleep of death ... what dreams maycome when we have shuffled offithis mortal coil , must give us pause .
there' s the respect that makes calamity ofso long life .
for who would bear the whips and scorns oftime .
th ' oppressor' s wrong , the proud man ' s contumely , the pangs ofdespised love , the law' s delay , the insolence of office
h m m .
looks i i ke we do have the old bard after all , sir .
looks like we do .
he' il handle it .
come on , foxworth .
th ' oppressor' s wrong , the proud man' s contumely , the pangs of despised love , the law' s delay , the insolence of office , and the spurns ... that patient merit ofth ' unworthy takes , when he himself might his quietus make with a bare bodkin ? .
that' s nice , david .
who would fardels bear , to grunt and sweat underweary life ,
but that the threat ... ofsomething after death , the undiscovered country ... from whose bourn and no traveller returns , puzzles the will , and makes us rather bear those ills we have ... than fly to others that we know not of ? .
i n the second book of the republic ,
plato says , " what will happen to the just man ... should he enter this world ? '
well , thejust man will be scourged , racked , chained .
then after every kind of misery , he will be crucified on a pole for all to see .
any questions ? .
i' ve got a question .
do you mind ? .
sure .
ifthe just man ... is treated as you say , then what' s the just response ? .
roll over and let evil have its wicked way ?
well , what would you recommend , major ?
oh , i' d recommend defiance .
j ustice for the captors .
an eye for an eye .
at what price mercy ?
yeah , mercy .
the last bastion of traitors and cowards .
so you would take a man and crucify him on a pole for all to see ?
i would seekjustice .
any of you ?
sergeant major ?
heave !
heave !
heave !
major campbell was a natural leader amongst men .
he seemed to draw them from all nationalities and groups ,
and he had a way with uniting them in a common cause his common cause .
better get two more of ours .
the guards change between 5 : 00 and half 5 : 00 every single day ,
so we have to be there , men .
sorry , major .
are we interrupting a church service ?
so what' s the story ?
major , let' s say your plan works , right ?
you' ve confiscated the guns , captured the guards , taken overthe whole camp .
what then ?
you have still nowhere to go .
and when the nips find out , we' il have a regiment a thousand strong ... descend on us with a vengeance .
you can' t possibly hope to survive .
who' s talkin ' about survival ?
so that' s what this is , a suicide mission .
come here .
come here .
so what areyou gonna do , eh ?
what areyou gonna do ?
you' re gonna throwyourself on the mercy of bushido ?
aye , now that would be suicide .
save us the bullshit , major .
what are they payin ' ya , yanker ?
huh ?
oh , didn' t he tell ya ?
some ofhis best trades are with the japs .
well , how' d you think they get such good medicine ? .
ain' t that right , yanker ? .
you tell them , yanker , eh ?
ha !
you are endangering the life ofeveryman in this camp .
i don' t think they agree with your idea of justice .
so , what , are you the voice of the people now , eh ? .
oryou may be just a wee bit too jap happy foryour own good .
ernie , we argyils have got to stick together .
and you know that' s what the colonel would say .
good boy .
greaterlove hath no man than this , that a man lay down his life for his friends .
you have heard that it was said , that you shall love your neighbor ... and hate your enemy .
but i say to you , love your enemy , andprayforthose who persecuteyou .
forwhat shall it profit a man ... ifhe gains the whole world , but loses his soul ?
for what will a man give in exchange for his soul ?
baht ?
baht .
you' re making a terrible mistake .
i can get you anything you want .
american chocolate , whiskey , american cig how about a watch ?
the majorimagined reardon a threat .
to him , a man without a sense ofduty ,
ioyal to no one but himself ,
is already a traitor .
shit .
no , please .
please .
it' s my school .
it' s my school !
major campbell struck a deal with the japs .
i was to be left alone .
in his mind , this was not considered betrayal .
the school had delayed his plans .
men were changing their minds .
and dusty had been the catalyst .
this book ... teaches to turn the other cheek .
we read these books , and we become better slaves for the emperor .
he says the book is superstition .
captain noguchi says the railroad progress is too slow .
he received orders from headquarters ... requiring us to finish six months earlier than it was scheduled .
honorable sir , that' s
you are dismissed .
superstition .
i' m still alive , you jap bastards !
you can understand that , can' t you ?
they could take away our books and classes , but we were determined they couldn ' t take away what we had learned in our university .
dusty led some ofthe men out of the death house to help draw water .
his example ofwhat we were learning inspired us to work like never before .
and our captors noticed .
as for the major , we refused to get even with him to pay him back in kind .
and it began to eat at him .
captain noguchi says he gives you your books back ... foryou to keep learning .
captain noguchi graciously givesyou these gifts ... for being good workers .
what is it ?
we' re back in business , lads !
oi , these are three years old .
japanese import laws .
there' s mail in here !
oh , let' s see it .
from that dayon , yankerneverspoke much .
something had changed inside him .
it was hard to tell whether it was for the better ... or the worse .
chi p , chi p , m uckers .
graduation ceremonies are coming .
i want a tip top performance out ofyou .
continue .
gentlemen ,
let' s continue .
if we are marked to die , we are enough to do our countryloss .
and ifto live , the fewer men , the greatershare ofhonor .
he that shall live and see old age , then shal i he stri p his sleeve and show his scars and say ,
these wounds i had on crispian' s day .
old men forget , yet all shall be forgot .
meat !
meat !
beef !
yanker decided to join us a bit late in the term , but eager to catch up .
you' re a good teacher .
what' s your name ?
i' m nagase .
takashi nagase .
hello , takashi .
i' m ernest .
i' ve actually been wonderin ' ... whereyou learnedsuch excellent english .
i was educated at cambridge .
to be a good translator ,
i thought one must understand the culture .
so what do you think of the british ? .
i think there is a lot to learn from them .
can iaskyou , honorable takashi , what are you doing here in this camp ? .
uh , i was classified low physical fitness .
prisoner ofwar camp is not honorable place forjapanese soldier .
it is more like punishment .
shame for his entire family .
well , what about ...
sergeant ito ? .
surely he' s the consummate soldier .
he accepted the blame for the bad decision that his superior made .
it resulted in the deaths of most ofhis squad .
right .
so that' s why he' s so bitter .
no .
in bushido , it is an honor to be punished in place ofyour superior .
according to our imperial rescript , in the emperor' s army , a single life weighs less than a feather .
no matter how good things got , we were still slaves building a railway , being starved to death .
thousands ofus in a dozen other prison camps as well .
and as ifthat weren ' t enough , the major and his dangerous plan seemed ready to explode at any moment .
it was a sobering thought when we realized ... we weren' t the only slaves being used in the name ofthe emperor .
they called them " comfort women " spoils ofjapanese conquest .
a conquest whose original intent was to purify the spirit ... where the true warrior deems his sword the soul of bushido the key ofheaven and hell .
a symbol ofwhat he carries in his heart
loyalty and honor .
we finished the railroad in october of 1943 , six months ahead ofschedule .
a real cause for celebration .
like we were told in the very beginning , they built it over the white man ' s body .
these damned yellow mongoloid nips .
actin' as ifthey built the bloody thing .
bloody rai lway of death .
that' s the least of our concerns .
what do you mean ?
we' ve built the railway .
don' t need us anymore .
those ofyou to the right of me will be immediately transferred ... to another camp .
it seemed like the final hindrance to the major' s plan .
half of his men were split apart that day .
sent away , never seen again .
attention , all prisoners ,
there is a shovel m issi ng from a toolshed .
the one who has taken the shovel , return it now .
if the shovel is not returned , the entire company will suffer punishment .
you will respect us .
the shovel was found .
there was a miscount a simple , bloody miscount .
you are dismissed .
what would compel a man , one so selfish , to sacrifice himself for others ?
boys , i can' t feel my legs .
i can' t feel my legs .
tonight' s the graduation ceremony .
japs have all been invited .
that means a slim to zero chance of anyone being left in the guardhouse .
major , you' re not still planning on going through with this ?
there' s only six of us .
we lost six men .
i thought it was near impossible with 12 .
god in heaven knows , we haven' t got a chance with six .
so now you' re privy to the mind of god in heaven ?
no , but  i will not tolerate double mindedness .
i' m stayin ' .
well , that leaves five .
don' t worry , boys .
you don' t worry , boys .
we' il have our justice .
major charlie fraser , language .
sergeant bingo johnson , philosophy .
and last , but by no means least ,
private wallace hamilton , ethics .
gentlemen , the graduates ... from our jungle university .
well , let the festivities begin .
the music we heard that night was less than perfect .
in fact , it was bloody terrible .
but we didn' t care .
in our hearts we heard what it could be .
we heard the true spirit ofthe music , and that was pure freedom .
if we are mark' d to die , we are enough to do our country loss .
go on .
do it .
guard .
down .
down .
come on .
come on now .
glad you could make it .
well , the music was bloody awful .
he that shall see this day and live old age ... shallstandat tiptoe when this dayis named .
then shall he strip his sleeve and show his scars , and say
there' s no ammo in this thing .
find it !
old men forget , yet all shall be forgot .
shh , shh , shh .
it' s a b 24 .
it' s liberators .
how can you be sure ?
it' s unmistakable , man .
sweet music , man .
it' s liberators !
alliedaircraft .
they couldn' t see us , but we could sure hear them .
and we knew that the war was turning .

these men are guilty of murdering two guards ... who represent the imperialarmy ...

when dusty miller died , something in the hearts ... and minds ofevery man died with him .
what we had somehow managed to hold onto for years of survival ... now seemed utterly meaningless ,
iike god himselfwas playing a crueljoke on us all , until i remembered dusty' s words so very long ago .
except a corn ofwheat to fall into the ground and die ,
it abideth alone .
but ifit die , it bringeth forth much fruit .
i never found out what dusty said to i to that day , but i knew i had witnessed the power offorgiveness .
attention .
soon , all inferior races will bow ... before the majesty of the em peror and the knights of the bushido .
when we heard the planes again , we thought our deliverance had finally arrived .
and then it happened .
hai i kni ghts of " bullshito !
our own allies thought we were the enemy .
give me a hand !
go on !
i' m fine !
help the other men !
hurry !
help me !

an enemy location was also hit nearby .
the wounded had abandoned their posts looking for help .
their arrival at our camp would compel us to make ... the most important decision ofour lives a decision that would defy the bushido code ... of honor and shame .
no good .
no good .
ernest ?
captain gordon , i forbid you to give comfort and aid to the enemy .
major , those ... are wounded , dying human beings .
they' re no harm to us .
ernie , get back to your own men .
could someone please get me some water ?
couldsomeone please get me some water ?
we were left alone by our captors .
nowhere to go .
nothing to do .
an uncertain future , with only a makeshift radio left behind , hoping for any word from the outside .
to all allied prisoners of war .
the japanese forces have surrendered unconditionally , and the war is over .
for he today that sheds his blood with me ... shall be my brother .
be he ne ' er so vile , this day shall gentle his condition ,
from this day to the ending ofthe world .
but we in it shall i be remembered , we few , we happy few , we band of brothers .
where are the guards ?
they they left .
fled into the jungle ... from us .
which direction ?
i have no idea .
you' re a man of true principle and devotion .
and you know ,
i wanna be just like you just like you .
major campbell ?
ernie .
you' re just in time .
you' re making a mistake .

what is the consequence of a single life weighing less than a feather ?
bastard !
bastard !
what is the final destination of hatred ?
when you look in the eyes ofthe enemy ... and you see yourself ,
come here .
at what price mercy ?
who is my neighbor ?
how many times shall i forgive my brother ?
what does it mean to love one' s enemies ?
what can a man give in exchange for his soul ?
these are the questions that i faced in my prison camp .
the answers ... changed my life forever .
