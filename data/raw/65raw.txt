great job gary .
thanks , you too steve .
that was the greatest acting i have ever seen .
i just don' t know how do you do it gary ?
how do you make youself so sober and emotional to make everybody cry like that ?
it' s not that hard really .
i just think about the saddest moment in my life .
man wow !
gary is such a great guy
hello young man !
congratulations on a terrific performance .
oh , thank you !
i don' t believe we' ve met mr. ... ?
the name is spottswoode
well nice to meet you .
and you are gary justin
all american actor who graduated iowa university
summa cum laude with a double major in ... theater and world languages
you' ve been at the top of every acting class since you were a child .
top gun actor .
hey hold on a second are you from hollywood ?
i have an incredible offer for you gary .
if you are interested follow me this way .
please gary , step into my car .
oh i get it !
i' m supposed to get in your car and let you put your finger inside me .
then if i go down on you i get a movie part .
no i just want to show you something
yeah , i bet you do
please gary i' m not from hollywood
i am not going to fuck your mouth ... and my time is extremely valuable !
jesus this is a nice limo .
yes it is !
now suck my cock !
haha !
just kidding .
all right .
just what the hell is this about ?
i hate to break this to you gary ... but some people out there want you dead .
dead ?
they are called terrorists , gary ... and they hate everything about you .
why ?
what did i do to them ?
i am just a broadway actor .
it' s not who you are gary .
it' s what you stand for .
and every single mintue of every single day
the terrorists are planning new ways to kill you .
and everyone else who lives in a free country .
the only thing standing in their way ... is us .
you ?
baxter , i think we can valmorphanize safely now .
ok a limousine that can fly !
now i have seen everything !
really ?
have you seen a man eat his own head ?
no so then you haven' t seen everything and neither have we .
last week in paris we got four terrorists with a weapon of mass destruction .
the terrorists are planning something very big .
and just what does this have to do with me ?
our only hope is to have somebody act like a terrorist ... who wants to help them carry out the attack .
an actor convincing enough to make the terrorists think he is one of them .
this is crazy .
i am an actor not a spy .
that' s all spying is ... acting !
and they say you are the best !
an actor with a double major in theater and world languages .
hell you are the perfect weapon gary .
look out !
right this way you maverick renegade .
welcome to team base .
gary , this is joe .
all star quarterback from the university of nebraska .
he is a natural born leader .
i' ve heard a lot about your acting mr. johnston
i hope it' s as good as they say it is .
and this is sarah .
the top empath from berkely school for the clairvoyant in san franciso .
i sense that you are slightly confused right now .
that' s suppose to be carson' s replacement ?
a fucking actor ?
don' t mind chris .
he may be lacking courtesy but he is the best martial art expert detroit has to offer .
that' s right actor .
just stay the fuck away from me .
and finally we have our psychology expert .
where is lisa ?
right here .
gary , this is lisa .
she specializes in how the terrorists think .
usually a case of malignant narcissism brought under in childhood .
we' ve been doing our best to keep the world safe , gary .
but now somebody has supplied the terrorists with wmds .
and intelligence tells us they plan to use them .
isn' t that right intelligence ?
that is affirmative !
intelligence ?
the most sophisticated computer in the world .
i' ve intercepted communications that several terrorists groups are being organized for one massive world wide attack .
from what intelligence has gathered it would be 911 times 100 .
911 times 100 jesus that' s ... ... yes , 91100 .
basically all the worst parts of the bible .
so now you see why we need you .
we will disguise you as a terrorist and take you deep into the middle east .
if your acting is successful you' il be able to get us all the information we need to stop this whole thing from happening .
of course ... if you are not interested ... there' s the door .
all right .
thanks .
huh .
gary , hey .
hold on a second !
don' t you understand ?
every country in the world is in danger .
how is it my responsibility to do something ?
because like it or not , you' re the one with the power to do something .
i can' t fight terrorists .
i don' t know nothing about guns or jets .
that doesn' t matter .
if you wanna help people all that matters is gary is what you have here .
just think about it , ok .
here , take this .
baxter will take you wherever you wanna go .
just remember your freedom is at stake too .
what do you think spottswoode sees in him ?
i don' t know .
but i think i see it too .
hey baxter i wanna take a detour .
# what would you do #
# if you were asked to give up your dreams for freedom ? #
# what would you do if that is to make the ultimate sacrifice ? #
# would you think about all them people ? #
# who gave up everything they had ? #
# would you think about all them war vets #
# and would you start to feel bad ? #
# freedom isn' t free #
# it costs folks like you and me #
# and if we don' t all chip in we' il never pay that bill #
# freedom isn' t free #
# no there is a hefty fuckin ' fee #
# and if you don' t throw in your buck ' o five who will ? #
# buck ' o five #
# freedom costs a buck ' o five #
our dear leader kim jong il ... says the weapons of mass destruction you requested are ready for you to take .
i am still in the process of recuriting ... and training new terrorists for the attack .
we take weapons later .
he asked what part of the deal you did not understand .
he says perhaps his translator did not make it clear to you .
he says he should fire ... his translator .
do you have any idea how fucking busy i am ?
i can not believe that i actually have a chenchnen standing here telling me when he is going to take a delivery .
hello .
perhaps we can be ready sooner .
yes , perhaps you can .
now take your weapons of mass desctruction and get the fuck out of here !
i ... had to come back .
i know you did son .
i still say this is a fucking mistake .
stop it chris !
i sense that you are making him feel intimidated .
gary i am afraid there is no time .
intelligence tells us that the attack is imminent .
we need you to act like a middle eastern terrorist right away .
there is just one problem .
i don' t look middle eastern .
hahaha leave that to us !
sarah is a professional at skin graphing and laser valmorphication .
just try to be still .
amazing !
the valmorphication completely worked .
sit up and take a look gary !
it' s uncanny .
you are going to fool everyone gary . ... or should i say hakmed ?
all right team , we only get one shot at this so listen up !
intelligence has intercepted communications that terrorists from different countries are gathering at a tavern !
here !
in cairo .
cairo ... that' s in egypt .
exactly right joe .
now team your mission .
we' il be to get gary into that tavern .
and once he is on the inside , cover his back !
gary , you must use your acting to find out any information you can from the terrorists .
gary , if for some reason you cover is blown ... and the terrorists take you prisoner ... well you will probably want to take your own life .
here you better have this .
all right team !
that' s it !
we' ve got a job to do .
let' s go police the world !
# americaamerica #
# america # # fuck yeah ! #

what if the old man is wrong about him , uh ?
what if he is not the actor spottswoode says he is ?

i was just thinking ... on stage if i mess up a line it could mean a bad review .
if i mess up here ... we' re all dead .

sometimes ... believing is all we have .

hey have you ever thought of telling sarah how you feel ?
ah , what would a girl like sarah want with a ... simple nebraska boy like me ?

still i' d love to show her a full moon night on the corn fields .
what do you know ?
i heard there may be a large terrorist attack .
if you tell me what it is maybe i can help out .
get out of here !
we have put a jihad on the infidels because they destroy our lives .
what do you know about pain and sadness ?
gary , gary , gary !
i was just a boy when the infidels came to my village in their black hawk hellicopters .
the infidels fired at the oil fields and they lid up like the eyes of allah .
burning oil rain down from the sky cooked everything it touched .
i could only hide myself and cry ... as my goats were consumed by fiery black liquid death .
in the midst of the chaos ...
i could swear that i heard my goats ... screaming for help .
as quickly as they' d come the infidels were gone .
it was on that day i put a jihad on them .
and if you don' t believe it then you better kill me now .
because i' ill put a jihad on you too .
i like you .
you have balls .
i like balls

the wmds are located in a secret bunker 20 yards east of this building .
you can help us by grabbing it ...

this is breaking news with peter jennings .
team america has once again pissed off the entire world after blowing up half of cairo .
and now some hollywood celebrities are lashing out .
alec baldwin is head of the film actors guild .
the film actors guild believes that what the world needs is compassion not violence .
all that team america does is create new enemies .
let me explain to you how this works .
you see the corporations finance team america ... and then team america goes out ... and the corporations sit there in their ... in their corporation buildings and ... and see that they are all corporationy and they make money .
last year i went to iraq .
before team america showed up it was a happy place .
they had flowery metals and rainbow skies ... and rivers made of chcolates where the children danced and laughed and played with gun drop smiles .
the actors are calling for an emergency meeting .

i am planning the attack !
congratulations team america !
you have stopped nothing !
congratulations gary .
you' ve done an amazing thing .
it will be years before the terrorists have the resources to attack again !
we are going to be unstoppable with you on the team gary .
terrorist your game is through .
you' re the best , gary .
when this terrorist shoots at us from the back of his jeep and ...
you might have all the others fooled but not me .
your acting was reckless and it put us all in danger .
the next time you put a stun like that ...
i' il drill two holes for your dick .
so that when you pee it will shoot out in all directions .
you got it ? !
hey sarah do you mind if i dance with you ?
no of course not joe .
joe do you think it' s ok for team members to date ?
sarah really ?
yeah do you think it' s all right ?
i think it' s better than all right .
it' s great .
oh good .
i' m so glad you think so .
gary , you' re ok ?
i was just wondering if i can let go of an old painful memory .
is it anything you want to talk about ?
when i was a kid i always looked up to my older brother tommy .
he was the jock and i was the little performer .
we were all at the zoo one day .
i was doing some acting ... walking on the railing of the gorilla exhibit .
i fell in .
everyone screamed and tommy jumped in after me forgetting that he had blueberries in his front pocket .
the gorillas just went wild .
they jumped all over his body ... and threw him around like a rag doll to get to those blueberries .
one gorilla would throw him to another gorilla who would toss him to another .
everyone panicked and cried out for somebody to help but ... it was too late ...
the gorillas beat him to death before the zoo keepers could gas them all .
my acting got my brother killed .
i had to live with that every single day .
gary you can' t blame yourself for what the gorillas did .
i think i can finally let it go , because ... my acting saved the entire world .
and something even better happened .
what ?
i met somebody who ... took my breath away .
gary , no !
i am sorry .
it' s just ... things are really complicated gary .
i know about carson .
i know how it feels .
god i am so confused .
it' s too soon to be having feelings for you .
maybe feelings are feelings because we can' t control them .
but i have to control them because i can' t go through losing somebody again .
it' s too painful !
so ... so what ?
you' re just gonna shut down ?
i really like you there' s no chance we can ever be togther ?
only if you could promise me you' il never die .
you know i can' t promise you that .
if you did that i would make love to you right now .
i promise .
i will never die .
# i need this , i need love , i need you #
# i don' t need one heartbeat , i need two #
# there is an emptiness i need to fill #
# and only one emptiness will do #
# only a woman #
# can brighten up my day #
# only a woman #
# can touch me the right way #
# only a woman #
# is allowed to touch me there #
# all i ask is that you' re a woman #
lisa you are the most amazing person i' ve ever met .
it' s only being a short time ... but i think that i am completely in love ... shhh
let' s not talk .
i can' t help it .
it just feels so right .
i don' t want anything to mess it up . shhh
there is not a thing in the world that can mess this up .
team i' m afraid i have bad news .
at 7 : 15 this morning the terrorists carried out their attack .
what ?
but how can that be ?
gary stopped the terrorists in cairo .
it appears now that intelligence was wrong about the chechenens being in charge .
that was bad intelligence .
very bad intelligence !
i am sorry .
we have to find out who did this and take them down ...
fast .
sir i' m intercepting communications about the terrorist identities .
on screen !
this is breaking news with peter jennings .
an attack in panama today has left thousands dead .
taking credit were terrorists from derkaderkastain .
of course derkaderkastain .
the terrorists claim that the attack was retaliation for team america' s action in cairo .
alec baldwin is rallying all the members of the film actors guild .
alec baldwin !
gary ?
he is ... he is my hero !
the single greatest actor of all time .
who is to blame for these attack at panama ?
the terrorists ?
the person who supplied them with the wmds ?
no !
blame team america !
their reckless disregard in cairo ... brought on this violence today !
team america ... the blood of the victims of panama is on your hands .
moved by alec baldwin' s impassionate speech hundreds of people turned out at mountain rushmore today to protest .
hey that' s here .
tom !
it looks like filmmaker michael moore is also jumping on the fuck team america bandwagon !
protesting is not enough !
we must take radical action against the fascists in our own country !
bring it down , bring it all down !
team , if the dekaderkastanies have weapons of mass destruction
i am afraid it could be 911 times a thousand .
jesus you mean ...
yes !
911, 000 .
then forget all this assholes .
we got work to do .
yes let' s get gary valmorphinized so we can use his acting .
my acting ?
my acting !
my acting just got a thousand people killed !
jesus i' ve done it again .
pull yourself together gary .
we need you now more than ever .
i' m through with this .
gary you can' t go .
without you the team is doomed !
remember there is no " i " in team america .
yes there is .
i know it' s hard gary ... but you are still the only hope to stop these newer terrorists .
why me ?
why am i the only one ?
because you are the one with the power to do so .
but i don' t want the fucking power .
i don' t want the guilt !
i don' t want the shame and ...
i don' t want the responsibility !
then what about all the things you promised last night ?
you said you' d never leave !
i said i' d never die , but now i' m dead inside .
you slept with gary ?
sarah ...
but you knew i liked gary .
i told you .
you like gary ?
oh , i see ...
i didn' t plan on it happening sarah .
save it lisa .
you see all i do is hurt people .
gary you didn' t kill your brother !
those gorillas did !
i' m sorry i' m not the man you think i am .
i' m just bad news .
i' ill never act again .
fuck him !
we don' t need an actor .
we can take out the derkaderkastainies the old fashion way .
no !
it will be a suicide mission .
that' s all right ...
i feel a little bit like dying .
god damn it gary .

i' ve hit rock bottom .
easy , easy ho .
you gotta calm down there chuck .
i hurt people .
i am a dick .
oh , being a dick isn' t so bad .
there are three kinds of people .
dicks , pussies , and assholes .
pussies think everyone can get alone .
and dicks just want to fuck all the time without thinking it through .
but then you get your assholes chuck !
and all the assholes want is to shit all over everything .
so pussies may get mad at dicks once in a while because pussies get fucked by dicks .
but dicks also fuck assholes , chuck .
and if they didn' t fuck the assholes you know what you get ?
you get your dick and your pussy all covered in shit .
all right that does it .
get out of here you drunk low life !
get out of here i said !
lisa !
lisa ?
lisa are you here ?
get out of the street you fuking bum !
you gave up on life didn' t you ?
my fellow actors !
we live in a dark time .
the world is becoming more and more violent and the idoits in charge are making it worse .
what the world needs is an international advisory committee who truly understands global politics .
namely ... us . erg ! erg ! erg !
the time has come for us to start using our acting talents in a different way .
yes we can use our powers to change the world . erg ! erg ! erg !
we' il persuvade everyone to drive hybrid cars and stop smoking .
if we focus our acting on global politics we can change everything and stuff ! erg ! erg ! erg !
as actors it' s our responsibility to read the newspapers and then say what we read on television like it' s our own opinion .
matt damon
we' il all done action films .
if anyone tries to get in our way we' il show them how tough we actors really are . erg ! erg ! erg !
i am glad you all agree because i' ve just been contacted by a very important political leader who has bringing all the world leaders together for a massive international peace conference and he wants us to be the keynote speakers . erg ! erg ! erg !
matt damon ! erg ! erg ! erg !
say hello to our new partner !
hello ? erg ! erg ! erg !
stop it !
stop it !
you are killing him .
i am gonna fucking kill you .
you are not in the position to kill anyone , my red , white and blue friend .
so you are the bastard planning 911 times a thousand .
no , you think so small .
you see , i am about to have an elaborate peace ceremony !
and while all the world' s most important peoples are distracted here
i will detonate the wmds which i have given to terrorists all around the globe .
it will be 911 times 2356 .
my god !
that' s ... i don' t even know what that is .
nobody does .
you heartless bastard !
why would you do such a thing .
because then i will be balance !
every country will be a third world country !
just imagine it .
all around the world there will be massive explosions .
with nobody to guide them the people will break out into panic and rioting all over the earth the true nature of humanity is unleashed .
dog eats dog as everyone attacks everyone and feds only for themselves .
global stability unravels .
by the time my show is over it will be far too late .
your plan will fail !
you will never keep the world leaders distracted here for 9 hours !
oh no ?
i' ve got alec baldwin .
damn god !
you are the rest of a dying breed ... the flag waving americans .
well your little dream will soon be over .
i must get back planning the ceremony now .
the film actors are on their way .
perhaps they' il stop in and say hello !
having so little faith in humanity must make you a very lonely man .
you shall have a front row seat .
bring her upstairs !
leave her alone you son of a bitch !
lisa , i treasure your friendship .
ah !
somebody has to stop this .
# i miss you more than michael bay missed the mark #
# when he made pearl harbor #
# i miss you more than that movie missed the point #
# and that' s an awful lot girl , and now #
# now you' ve gone away #
# all i' m trying to say #
# is pearl harbor sucked #
# and i missed you #

what the hell happened ?
hello anybody ?
greetings mr. johnston .
intelligence what the hell happened ?
our base was attacked by a giant socialist weasel .
but where is the team ?
they have been taken prisoner by kim jong il in north korea .
i have intercepted communications that ... he is planning the massive attack during a peace ceremony .
don' t move protestor or i will blow your commy brains out .
spottswoode ?
johnston ?
what the hell are you doing here ?
get away from intelligence !
i am using it to blow up north korea .
no !
the team is in north korea .
i know and so are the triggers to wmds poised all around the globle
my only opinion now is to blow up kim jong il ... and everything around him before he can set them off .
intelligence , initiate detonation sequences on the ships .
you' il kill them all !
it' s what they would want me to do gary !
they would happily give their lives ... for the good of the world something you don' t understand .
there has to be another way .
there is nobody left to stop kim jong il .
let me go !
you ?
you are a butt fucking quitter !
you walked out gary .
the team went on a mission without you and ... without an actor they were like pigs to the slaughter .
i am suppose to leave the fate of the world in your hands ?
i know i walked out but i' d do anything to take it back !
please just let me help !
you' ve done enough
please !
spottswoode you have to believe in me !
i want to believe in you gary .
i really do .
but you' ve let me down before .
please !
how can i make you trust me ?
i remembered the first time we met .
you were a simple broadway actor afraid to get in my limo because you thought i wanted you to perform oral sex on me .
do you remember that ?
yeah
but now the tables are turned and i don' t know if i can trust you .
just give me a chance .
alright !
i will trust you ... but only if you will perform oral sex on me .
what ?
right here , right now .
you can' t be serious .
oh i am serious .
look , this is my serious face .
what will that prove ?
it will prove that you are truly ready to lay everything on the line
to throw away all you innervations and get 100 percent
we must go back to the first night we met that first issue of trust .
don' t you see ?
no , i thought you weren' t gay .
this isn' t about sex gary ... it' s about trust !
it is the eye of the needle gary !
and we must both pass through it .
ok , let' s do it .
ah , make sure nobody is watching .
yeah , looks clear .
ok , go !
there must be another way
huh , i guess you won' t do everything ... to take it all back , will you gary ?
no , no , no ... wait ... hold on !
you are saying if i do that you' il let me help the team ?
i will give you all the time i can !
ok , let' s do it !
here we go .
and go !
you are dedicated .
now let' s go get cleaned up !
if you are going to storm kim jong il' s palace single handed ... we have to make you a complete solider in very little time .
how we gonna do that ?
i think i know just what we need .
# the hours approaching , just give it your best .
you got to reach your prime . #
# that' s when you need to put yourself to the test #
# and show us a passage of time #
# we' re going to need a montage # # montage #
# wu it takes a montage # # montage #
# sure a lot of things happening at once #
# with mind , everyone what' s going on # # what' s going on ? #
# and whith every shot you show a little improvement #
# just show it or it will take to long #
# that' s called a montage # # montage #
# here we want montage # # montage #
# and anything that we want to know #
# from just a beginner to a pro #
# you need a montage # # montage #
# even rocky had a montage # # montage #
# always fade out in a montage # # montage #
# if you fade out , it seem like more time has passed in a montage # # montage #

goodbye team america .
i' ve just got one piece of bad news for you robbins .

stop that man !
gary
team america ?
god damn it !
sorry to interrupt the show everyone but kim jong il is an international criminal !
we are here to arrest him !
oh no you are not !
this is a peace conference and if you even try to touch kim jong il , this audience and i will rise up against you .
team there is no time !
you have to convince that audience to let you do your job !
gary you' ve got to take the stage .
no , i can' t upstage alec baldwin ...
he is the best actor in the world !
you have to try .
i am not that good .
actually !
you are the finest actor i' ve never met .
come on gary !
hurry , you' ve got to act fast .
i know you all don' t like team america a whole lot right now but ...
kim jong il is a lot worse .
you can' t outact me boy .
don' t even try !
for the truth is that team america fights ... for the billion dollar corporations !
they are just as bad as the enemies they fight .
no we aren' t !
we are dicks !
we are reckless arrogent stupid dicks .
and the film actors guild are pussies .
and kim jong il is an asshole .
pussies don' t like dicks because pussies get fucked by dicks .
but dicks also fuck assholes .
assholes who just want to shit on everything .
pussies may think they can deal with assholes their way .
but the only thing that can fuck an asshole ... is a dick ... with some balls .
the problem with dicks ... is sometimes they fuck too much !
or fuck what isn' t appropiate ...
yes gary , yes !
and it takes a pussy to show him that .
but sometimes pussies get so full of shit ... that they become assholes themselves !
because pussies are only an inch and half away form assholes .
i don' t know much in this crazy crazy world ... but i do know ... that if you don' t let us fuck this asshole , we are going to have our dicks and pussies all covered in shit .
stop what you are doing kim jong il !
do something alec baldwin !
the global warming and corporate america ...
fire you !
you are worthless alec baldwin !
don' t fucking move !
you were all going to be treated to a fabulous show !
but now party is over for i am the great kim jong il .

but the world will be safe !
thanks to a briliant actor ... named gary johnston .
let me explain to you the kind of man gary is .
he is a man who knows ... that when you put another man' s cock in your mouth ... you make a pact !
a bond that cannot be broken !
he is the man so dedicated ... that he will get down on his knees ... and put that cock right into his mouth !
wait a minute !
