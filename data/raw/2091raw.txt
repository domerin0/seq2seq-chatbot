don' t worry about daniel .
he' s just self conscious about his neck because he did it to himself .
he had this thing where he' d pump his stomach so he wouldn' t get a hangover .
i guess he knew how , because , you know , he' s a doctor .
or was .
he lost his license after he killed that patient , but ....
anyway , i guess one night while he was scraping that tube to his stomach ... ... somehow he screwed up and he couldn' t breathe and he had to ...
... poke a hole in his throat with a pen or something .
jasper , see ifyou can dig up some vicodin .

decaf .
there' s no caffeine .
it' s mood altering .
hi .
that was a nice moment .

gum ?
it wasn' t a problem ... ... till emmett , he took up with that girl .
those nights that he was out with her ... ... and i was home with the tv ....
see , i figured we could see it through .
so when he said ... ... he was moving her in with us ... ... and that i could stay or leave ... ... l see now i should' ve left .
i' ve got something ....
when you ....
you want to do it later ?
i think , yeah .

i don' t know how to explain .
all right .
okay , well , that' s a good start .
another time .
it' s all right .
so let' s finish up today with a prayer , all right ?
let' s all hold hands .
god , grant me the serenity ... ... to accept the things i cannot change ... ... the courage to change the things i can ... ... and the wisdom to know the difference .
it works if you work it .
it' s worth it !

i mean , how can you get stuff ?
can you get stuff , or is it , like ... ?
if your counselor catches you using , you can get kicked out .
i don' t plan on discussing it with him .
too late .
generally , people come to rehab not to get loaded .
well , i try not to run with the pack .
you' re a real individual .
you' re the only person who does drugs and alcohol .
i meant what i said .
you get caught using , you risk getting kicked out .
fair enough .
we done ?
and believe me , i' il know if you' re using .
you always this charming ?
you always use humor to deflect things when you' re uneasy ?
do you always use insight to disarm your new recruits ?
what' s that ?
it' s literature about your disease .
aa big book , some worksheets .
a journal i want you to write in every day .
i suppose i have to do this .
you got better things to do with your time ?

drunk men stagger , drunk men fall drunk men swearand that' s not all

th ere is yet to be a perfectly straight line
hi , everybody .
so what' s the deal ?
i' m out ?
it' il take me a day to arrange your transfer .
i know where i want to go .
this place in the city
i' m not referring you to a treatment facility .
i get to go home ?
nope .
where am i going , then ?
your sentence was for 28 days of rehab or jail time .
you don' t honestly think i' m going to jail , do you ?
for driving drunk , hitting a lawn jockey that could' ve been a 4 year old child ?
but it wasn' t .
it was a 4 year old lawn jockey .
that' s fine if this is all a big joke , but in here we have rules .
and i warned you about them .
pack your bags by morning .
no , i' m not .
because i don' t belong in jail .
i don' t even belong in here .
you know , yeah , i know i drink a lot .
i' m a writer , and that' s what i do , we drink .

hi , my name is corn ell .
hi , my name is corn ell .
i am a drug addict , alcoholic , compulsive gambleriliar .
hi , cornell .
for those of you who are new tonight ... ... l know that this is not your year .
if that' il make you happy , i will stop drinking .
tonight i will not get wasted .
and then something would happen .
or nothing would happen .
and i' d get that feeling .
and you all know what that feeling is .
wh en yourskin is screaming ... ... and yourhands are shaking ... ... and yourstomach feels like it wants tojump ... ... thro ugh your throat .
and you know that ifanyone had a clue ... ... how wrong it felt to be sober . .. ... th ey wouldn' t dream ofasking you to stay that way .
th ey would say , " oh, jeez , i didn' t know .
here .
it' s okay foryou .
yo u do that mound of cocaine .
have a drink .
have 20 drinks .
whateveryou need to do to feel ... ... like a normal human being ... ... you do it .
and , boy , i did it .
i drank , and i snorted ... ... and i drank and snorted and drank and snorted .
and i did this day after day afternight afternight .
i didn' t care about th e consequences .
because i knew that th ey couldn' t be halfas bad as not using .
oh , god !
and then one night something happened .
you know you' re screwed .
i woke up .
i woke up on a sidewalk .
i had no idea where i was .
i couldn' t have told you the city i was in .
my head was pounding ... ... and i looked down and my shirt is covered in blood .
and as i' m lying th ere , wondering what happens next . ..
... l heard a voice .
man , this is not a way to live .
this is a way to die .
can i help you ?
eddie boone , checking in .
you can' t bring a girl into treatment with you , eddie .
i wasn' t gonna keep her .
you were really lucky you didn' t break anything .
it' il be tender and swollen for a while .
you' il have to live with the pain , because i can' t give you anything .
so take these .
that' s good .
listen , rest .
alternate heat and cold .
you know , your carpet is filthy .
i only bring that up because ... ... carpet grit' s responsible for a lot of major health problems .
that' s the last thing that you need around here .
listen , about that jail thing ... ... l can' t .
i can' t go .
not because i don' t want to go , but ....
oh , god , my hands .
they just keep doing that .
that' s not normal .
there' s something wrong with my hands .
well , with me .
because what kind of person just jumps out of a window , you know ?
because she can' t sit still , you know ?
and be alone , and , you know , in a room without ....
you know , a person should be able to just be alone , right ?
you know , human beings should be able to just breathe .
i can' t breathe .
and i feel that ....
i think , i know that if i go to jail ... ... like this , you know , i' il die .
i don' t want to die .
i don' t like what' s happening here .
wait a minute , let' s try to use a feeling word .
i' m pissed !
okay , pissed .
why ?
because no way should she be here .
tell her .
no way should you be here !
that' s right .
there' s a rule .
no using .
you broke it .
i' m sorry .
sorry , my ass .
all you' ve done since you got here is sit around while the rest of us work .
you expect us to be glad that they let you stay ?
i' m not expecting anything .
gwen , just listening .
everybody , feeling words .
i don' t think you are giving .
i don' t feel that you are giving person .
i' m trying !
i don' t feel niceness coming from you .
should i go to another group ?
great idea .
spread your negativity even further .
you know , if you really try ... ... you could ruin the experience for the entire patient population .
i am having a bad day !
i am having the worst damn day of my whole damn life !
so if it is not too much to ask of you people ... ... will you just back the fuck off ? !
excellent work .
really excellent work .
good sharing , everybody .
i' m sorry .
i' m sorry .
i wanted to talk to you about last night .
i don' t normally do that , but you were great .
oh , my lord .
you gotta be kidding me .
what ?
promise me we were safe .
we were what ?
safe .
safe ?
you' re not one of them paternity suit kind of gals
what are you talking about ?
what are you talking about ?
i' m talking about last night .
you don' t remember last night ?
i got a little drunk on the plane .
of course you did .
you know what ?
it was nothing .
just don' t worry about it .
we didn' t ... ?
nope .
thank god , boy
you know what ?
that' s more than enough , thank you .
no more ending up naked with some girl i don' t know .
that' s a noble goal , and i wish you the very best of luck with it .
cirrhosis is the ninth leading cause of death in the united states ... ... and 45 %%% of the time , that is alcohol induced .
let' s take a look at the first slide .
this could be your liver right now .
do you have plans for dinner ?
this is not a test about you and how you act in relationships .
it' s called equine therapy .
tennessee doesn' t lie and manipulate .
he' il just respond to how you feel .
and your job is to clean his hoof .
this is how one gets sober ?
it' s character revealing .
the way we approach the horse ... ... is like the way we approach the world .
we gotta try to match our insides with our outsides .
be real .
so my therapist today is a very large , smelly beast of burden .
we' re totally in sync .
step in , you breathe .
couldn' t stink more if he were dead .
you reach down , pinch the tendon ... ... trust yourself , and let the horse do the rest .
who' s gonna be first ?
gwen ?
think you might need help ?
nope , i' m fine .
let yourself go .
all right , mr. ed , just pick up your stupid foot .
can' t force it .
sure you don' t need some help ?
no .
i' m fine .
all right , look , cornell , just give me a pill ... ... give me a shot , i don' t know , give me a lobotomy .
instant gratification has worked so well for you in the past .
just take it easy and keep it simple .
i am so tired by the way you people talk .
one day at a time . " what is that ?
two , three days at a time is an option ?
i don' t need the romperroom bullshit .
i need ....
what are you doing ?
it' s a therapeutic tool .
you leave me no choice .
betty , you gotta get me a new roommate .
he stinks .
i don' t know if he' s just eating beef ... ... and secreting ketones out of every pore
we' re gonna come back to this .
i' m gonna be back .
we' re in each other' s lives , okay ?
gwen , did you get a sign ?
confront me if i don' t ask for help .
what kind of help you looking for exactly ?
okay , traci .
when you do drugs , this is what happens . " okay ?
when you do drugs , you don' t do any fun stuff like you used to .
be specific , traci .
what was fun ?
well , when you play games with us and do puzzles .
that was fun .
i have an idea .
tell your mom about the drawing , darnell .
it' s of me and traci home late at night , and mom' s not there .
tell your mom how that makes you feel when she' s not there .
worried .
scared .
great .
man !
not again .
i don' t know .
mom , wake up .
i don' t know .
mom ?
hello , wake up !
sad , i guess .
lonely .
hello ?
no reactions .
i have an idea .
she' s fine .
she' s up .
bye .
hey , hey , what do you know ?
pills and booze have got to go !
hey , hey , what do you say ?
sober is the only way !
good night , eddie .
wait for me !
beat you !
girls !
what ?
aunt helen , why are you here ?
where' s mom ?
i' m just gonna be straight with you .
your mother has passed .
just slap her real hard and she' il wake up .
this' il only be fora while until we figure out something more permanent .
hello ?
hey , it' s me .
gwen .
well , i know which " me " it is .
what is it ?
let me guess .
yo u need money .
i' m not giving you any more money .
lil , i don' t need money .
it' s different this time .
i' m glad to hearit .
whatever happened to our fun and friendly sister rapport ?
i don' t know .
you tell me .
look , they make you ....
they' re having a family week .
what ?
family sessions .
they work with us for a few days , teach us how to talk to each other ... ... and then supervise an actual conversation .
you want me to come there ?
they make you ask somebody , so it' s either you or aunt helen .
so let me get this straight .
you screw up , and then i' m supposed to drop everything in my life ?
they can schedule it around what' s good for you .
so ....
no , it' s just
i' m cooking here , okay ?
i' ve got people coming over .
oh , god , i' m sorry .
i didn' t mean ....
no , you never do .
gwen , you never mean anything .
i have to go .
lil , look , i bet this one' s really fast .
it' s just a table , stupid .
leave it alone .
no .
it' s a sled .
well , i' m not a fan of all soap operas .
just santa cruz .
i mean , it' s just an incredible show .
i saw it the first time ... ... when i was hospitalized a while ago after i got out of my first rehab .
there was this girl on the show , darian .
she was also hospitalized , and it was like i was staring at myself .
i mean , not physically , because i don' t have the curly hair .
this whole thing had happened with her .
she had actually been impregnated by her brother ... ... but she obviously didn' t know it was her brother at the time .
and i don' t have a brother .
but i have sisters .
so it' s really sort of ... ... been an inspiration ... ... for me .
and it' s really sort of helped me stay sober ... ... off and on .
mom , everything' s okay .
hey , andrea .
hey , daniel .
want to give me one of those ?
get your own .
all right , then .
hey , gary , can i bum a cig ?
there she is .
hello , darling .
how are you ?
christ !
oh , my god , what' s that ?
nothing .
you poor thing !
what are they doing to you ?
i fell .
is that part of the therapy ?
you poor baby .
i know , i' il get you home , darling .
everyone' s asking after you .
like who ?
like mrs. lefkowitz from downstairs .
remember ?
the non talker ?
five years , not a peep .
thanks god you got rid of that girl .
she' s nothing but bad news .
that' s not funny .
of course it' s funny .
anonymous strangers thinking i' m bad news , that' s not funny .
everyone i' ve told has laughed really hard .
that' s great .
you need cheering up .
i' il take you away .
what ?
get away from these freaky people .
i don' t want to leave oh , god !
here , have some cheese .
have it on a roll .
no bread .
i' m getting fat .
it' s better with bread .
i don' t want bread .
i' il have the bread .
just break it open for me , will you ?
what is your problem ?
break open the bread .
this is a ring .
yep .
what , are you proposing ?
yeah , i am .
at rehab .
no .
i' m proposing to you now .
you happen to be here .
yeah , but ....
i don' t know .
i mean ....
well , how did he ask ?
he visited me in rehab and ....
so it' s not moonlight in maui .
where would we get married ?
mcsorley' s pub ?
why not ?
make a good story .
i don' t need any more stories .
i have enough stories .
i would like a life .
that' s what i was offering .
what is that ?
champagne .
i brought it thinking , wrongly , this might be a romantic moment .
this is so not how i saw this whole thing playing out !
i' m not taking this as lightly as i used to .
taking what ?
this .
this .
this straighten up and fly right thing .
this ....
i don' t know .
maybe there is something wrong with me .
that' s what they say ?
no !
it is .
you know what ?
i think they' re right .
they' re not .
you' re just in a rut .
it happens to everyone .
no , there' s an entire world of people who do everything right .
they live right , they don' t drink , they don' t do drugs .
a crock of shit .
they' re happy .
they' re not happy .
no adult human being is happy .
people are born .
they have a limited time to think life is dandy , but then ... ... inevitably , tragedy strikes and they realize life equals loss .
the point of the game is to minimize the pain caused by that equation .
some people do it by having kids or making money or coin collecting .
and others do it by getting wasted .
letting that switch in the head turn the hot light off and the cool light on .
nobody gets hurt collecting coins .
everybody hurts everybody .
it' s the human condition !
don' t let them tell you there' s something wrong with you !
you' re fine !
i don' t feel fine .
of course not .
you' re in deliverance country surrounded by sober freaks .
and you' re not with me .
i don' t feel fine these days either , and i think that' s because we' re apart .
you' re mine .
i' m yours .
i love you .
why do you want me , jasper ?
i am such a mess .
maybe i like mess .
th ere ' s a time when you can share ... ... and you can hold hands and be on the same path .
but there' s always a fork in the road at some point .
and sometimes you have to go on one part of the fork ... ... and they gotta go on the other part of the fork .
or just down the back part of the fork while you go forward .
and they' re like ....
or they got a salad fork and you have a big dinner fork ... ... and you have longer to go , but they' re done , because that' s it .
they' re stuck on a piece of food that they ....
the dessert fork or , like , one of those , you know ... ... small crab forks , and you' re trying to get out a crab .
and you' re over here jumping to the huge serving fork ... ... or something like that .
or a ladle , you know .
hey , and ?
guess what .
goober .
are you not talking to me right now ?
i only had , like , five pieces .
what are you doing ?
here , give me that .
she didn' t come .
your mom ?
i waited all day for her .
i did my hair .
she probably had to work or something like that .
no , she just hates me .
i make her embarrassed .
she doesn' t hate you .
i' il get someone .
don' t tell anybody !
it' s okay .
we have to .
it' s very serious .
they' il take me to psychiatric !
please , i can' t get kicked out again .
okay , we' re not gonna go anywhere , all right ?
all right , come on .
why don' t we go in the other room ?
how did you do that ?
what ?
that ?
it' s pretty easy .
you just take one of these .
tear it in half .
just so you know , i wasn' t ... ... trying to off myself or anything .
it' s just something i do sometimes .
doesn' t it hurt ?
it feels better .
than what ?
everything else .
like that .
then you try and slip them into the cracks like that .
is he a drunk ?
i don' t know .
maybe .
then you' il have to say no .
it' s just like darian and falcon .
he was addicted to gambling ... ... and even though she completely loved him ... ... she had to walk away .
do i know these people ?
from santa cruz .
it was more complicated for them .
they were actually half brother , half sister .
but darian didn' t know that when she found out about the gambling .
can' t believe this is the advice i' m getting .
a show doesn' t stay on the air for 1 8 years for being stupid .
i' ve worked all 12 steps .
can i go home now ?
bus is here .
thanks .
oh , my god .
let' s go , team !
it' s all about trust today .
come here .
listen .
about last night , i really think you should tell somebody .
oh , yeah .
i already did .
yeah , when ?
this morning .
i found my counselor , and i told her ... ... and we talked about it .
she' il help me .
hold on .
you really talked to her ?
no , i' m making it up .
we don' t really have to climb this thing , do we ?
we don' t know the whole story .
we ought to hear her side ... ... before we go saying what' s what .
guzzling gwen !
what' s with the ring in the roll guy ?
who ?
your boyfriend !
andrea , does the phrase " in confidence " mean anything ?
you never said not to tell .
i know better than anyone how important it is who you marry .
but just because somebody proposes , that don' t mean you have to say yes .
did someone propose to gwen ?
her boyfriend .
i thought gwen was a lesbian .
i' m not a lesbian !
it' s okay if you are .
can we talk about something else ?
when did this happen ?
yesterday .
on the lake .
was it sunset ?
sunset by the lake is very romantic .
it was lunchtime , and he brought a picnic ... ... with champagne .
he brought champagne ?
we didn' t drink it .
i threw it overboard .
it' s not a very cool guy to bring you booze in rehab .
he doesn' t understand what i' m doing here .
if you' re serious about getting sober , your love partner would know .
you must not be committed to your recovery .
oh , my god !
sorry .
shouldn' t you be doing something now ?
i got you .
i say you dump that guy .
i can make this decision on my own , okay ?
i don' t need your help .
that' s not what your sign says .
forget what my sign says !
he doesn' t know a thing about me !
neither do you all !
you don' t live my shitty life .
until you do , do not tell me to give up the one person that matters to me !
i know he' s not perfect , but he' s the one that' il show up on my birthday ... ... and say , " i' m glad you were born !
what' s the matter with you ?
just let go .
trust it .
oh , my god !
look at my package .
no matter where i may roam
on land orsea or foam
yo u can always hearme singing this song
show me th e way to go home
here we go .
is there a key to the ladies ' room ?
thank you .
excuse me , sir .
can i have the key to the men' s room ?
what ?
what ?
eddie boone !
thank you .
come on , come on , come on .
i need some paper , some pens .
dad , we need a napkin or something .
okay , hold on .
let me look .
this is all i got .
that' s it .
thanks .

and i' m dan .
adam and dan .

i bet it' s really cool !
my car ?
guys , we gotta get home .
say goodbye now .
nice to meet you .
yeah .
nice to meet you .
have a great season , eddie .
mail call .
charm blossom , this really isn' t necessary .
lining up the mail like a bar graph to show the fullness of our lives .
i know my life is empty , okay ?
for you .
watching game tapes ?
yep .
they' re out of ginger snaps .
looks like your mail' s more fun than mine .
do you want them ?
you don' t want them ?
no .
what' d you get ?
my sister' s coming to family sessions .
that' s good .
no .
i' d pay very good money not to hear what she has to say .
so what' s wrong with your balls ?
so to speak .
so to speak , nothing .
i don' t want them .
why not ?
because i don' t .
that' s a tautology .
something is what it is because it is what it is .
the sky is blue because it reflects the ocean .
the ocean is blue because it reflects the sky .
who are you talking to ?
i have no idea .
i bet you can' t sit still and be quiet for one minute .
i can .
is this what we' re doing now ?
a little quiet contest ?
wait a minute !
these are not game tapes .
wait !
oh , my god !
let me have that !
i know what this is !
i can' t believe you watch this !
i wasn' t !
santa cruz watcher .
i' m sorry .
it' s fine .
no , i' m sorry , i' m sorry .
no , it' s totally fine .
i always do that .
i always do that .
you always do what ?
women ....
drugs , women .
i mean , just leap before you think .
not you .
i mean ....
what are you saying ?
what ?
you were ... ... trying to snort me ?
yeah , maybe .
what a perfect opportunity to thank him for curing your cancer .
ifl had known he was gonna save yourlife just tojoin it with his ... ... l would' ve preferred you' d died .
pretty good show once you get to know everybody in it .
so who sent you all those balls ?
my agent .
he' s trying to psych me up .
oh , for next season ?
well , for there to be a next season .
why ?
you thinking about retiring ?
i don' t know .
might have to .
i mean , you gotta quit sometime .
i' m not 22 anymore .
plus , you know , maybe a more normal life ... ... might be a little less pressure .
i understand .
marry a cute girl , move to the suburbs ... ... spend your weekends mowing .
you won' t want to do coke again .
are you okay ?
th ese headaches !
darian ?
darian ?
what th e hell is he doing here ?
get an ambulance .
he has meligioma astro cytroma .
what is it ?
a tiny little cluster ofbrain tumors .
tiny clusters " ?
he' s very sick .
attention all patients .
what' s wrong with celebrating sobriety by getting drunk ?
give it to her .
just give it to her .
my god !
where did you get this ?
guys , this is the soap opera that i watch .
you watch my soap ?
yeah .
eddie , you surprise me .
i only work every fifth day .
what else do i do with my time ?
well , thank you very much .
sometimes i like to read .
you know , literature ?
stuff like that .
yo urbetting is what lostyou yourmoney and my respect .
i love you .
mom , dr. griffin , what are you doing here ?
we ' ve come to tell you something about falcon .
darian , it looks like i may be carrying falcon' s child .
what do you want to bet that child ... ... turns out to have a gambling problem ?
it' s just anoth er tiny cluster .
do something !
it' il be overin a minute .
he' il get over it .
falcon will be back , better than ever .
no , falcon' s leaving the show .
he' s having brain clusters .
mayb e it' s more than a tiny cluster .
i hate that mother .
i love her .
you do ?
i think she' s hilarious .
i want you to talk to gwen , and be specific .
pick one incident .
you ruined my wedding .
and when that happened , how did you feel ?
how do you think it made me feel ?
tell her .
i' m trying to explain here , okay ?
i mean , you asked me , so i' m just ....
i mean , she shows up drunk ... ... stumbles through the entire ceremony .
at the reception , she gets up ... ... and , in front of my friends ... ... my new in laws , she gives this toast ...
... that was completely  what ?
what toast ?
gwen , let your sister talk .
what toast ?
well , not everybody can be perfect .
but at least some of us can try .
we all know that grownups have to make compromises .
and lily is very , very grown up .
so that' s what she did .
ls andrew ... ... the very best man for me ... ... on this earth ?
no .
and i mean , no .
she says , " hey , i' m not getting any younger .
he makes a hell of a lot of money .
so i' il marry the little sucker .
to lily and her little sucker .
that' s not what happened .
you think that your memory of that day is somehow better than mine ?
i don' t think so .
stick with the format .
i' m sticking to the format .
i' m just trying to give you a picture here .
and she walks around ... ... like some victim ... ... like life just handed her this raw deal .
well , you know , my father left too .
and my mother died when i was little too .
and you don' t see me using that ... ... as some excuse to just completely abandon all self control ... ... and indulge myself
indulge ?
what ?
you think i like this ?
we' ve gotten off track here .
lily .
think about gwen' s behavior at your wedding ... ... and tell her now how you feel .
yeah , lily , how does it make you feel ?
you know , this is just ....
i don' t need this .
i have a life .
lily , wait for me .
beat you .
what are you doing ?
great .
another thing i suck at .
well , hold on .
gwen , hey .
please .
come here a second .
what ?
what were you thinking about ?
when you threw the ball , what were you thinking about ?
i don' t know .
the mating habits of african ants .
i don' t know .
the striped thing .
you were thinking about hitting the mattress .
well , you know , it might sound funny to you , but that' s all wrong .
when you lock in on the strike zone ... ... it' s looking about the size of a peanut .
and you think , " damn .
i gotta get that little ball in there ?
you' ve psyched yourself right out of the game .
the strike zone , the call ... ... the count , the batter , forget all that .
you gotta think about the little things .
the things you can control .
you can control your stance , your balance ... ... your release , your follow through .
think about those little things and only those little things ....
you know ?
i mean ....
because when you let go of the ball ... ... it' s over .
you don' t have a say in what happens .
that' s somebody else' s job .
i want you to try this .
i don' t want to .
i' m just curious .
i don' t want to do it .
i just want to see how you hold it .
don' t grab it , don' t grab it .
look at it , look at it .
hold it like an egg .
loose .
easy .
all right ?
let me get a look at it from over there .
let me get a look at it from over there .
all right .
i want you to throw it over here nice and easy .
point at me with your left hand .
throw it where you' re pointing at .
better .
but you nutted the batter ... ... and the other team' s beating the crap out of you .
try again .
heads up .
i want you to do it again .
this time , shut your eyes .
what ?
just shut your eyes .
so weird .
fire away .
right there .
that is a strike in any country .
you' re a natural .
come on .
folks , the definition of insanity ... ... is repeating the same behavior over and over , expecting different results .
thank you .
i have a question .
once we all leave , we have needs that are going to need to be filled ... ... by people , physically , at times .
how and when can we do that ?
not how , just when ?
yeah , i know , i know .
people in recovery want to know when' s a good time to start dating .
and my rule of thumb is , when you get home , get yourself a plant .
i like spider plants , but whatever turns you on .
then , in about a year , get a pet .
and then , if , in say ... ... two years , the plant and the pet are still alive ... ... then you can start to think about having a relationship .
thanks .
i' il be fine .
i know what to do .
don' t drink , go to meetings , find a sponsor , ask for help .
don' t drink , go to meetings , find a sponsor , ask for help .
happy trails to you
keep smiling until th en
wh o cares about th e clouds
if we' re togeth er
just sing a song and bring th e sunny . ...
well , i hope he makes it .
statistically , only three out of 1 0 of us will .
so in a way ... ... it' s good for us if he goes back to using .
you know ?
odds wise .
god , i love afternoons like this .
do you know what' s missing ?
that i don' t have a dry vodka martini with two olives in a chilled glass .
god , i miss that .
lately i' ve been lying awake at night ... ... thinking of the dumb ass things i' ve done when i was messed up .
one night last year , at dinner , i threw up all over my glazed ham .
then i thought , " well , maybe nobody noticed .
i don' t think of it as a garnish .
i' m a winner .
oh , god .
you know what the worst one was ?
for me ?
my best friend in the whole world .
we grew up playing ball , hunting and fishing .
one sunday morning , he walks in on me and his wife in bed .
you never live that one down .
tell me one of yours .
excuse me ?
what' s the worst thing you did when you were messed up ?
i don' t know .
come on .
give me a couple .
i' il pick one .
i don' t really remember any .
i just told you some stuff that' s ....
i' m a drunk .
drunks forget everything .
you know ?
come on .
why ?
so i can recount the last 1 5 disgusting years to humiliate myself ?
no , thanks .
why not ?
because i don' t feel like talking about it .
you too good for me ?
are you dense ?
did your mom drop you on your head ?
i said no .
i don' t want to talk about it .
just drop it .
god , it' s so hard .
yo u' re a doctor .
that' s th e way it' s supposed to be .
we carry our own bags here .
this isn' t the sheraton .
your chores are posted .
we will take the stairs .
what ?
i paid you a shitload of money .
i am not doing any chores .
pills .
booze .
coke and sex .
it' s your daughter , darian , deirdre .
don' t worry about darian .
i tucked herinto bed hours ago .
so did l .
no .
oh , god !
it was an unbelievable episode .
i wish you' d seen it .
everyone was losing their minds .
what are you doing ?
packing .
what does it look like ?
you' re not leaving for a couple days .
so ?
i am leaving .
might as well get ready .
there' s no point in making this room all homey ... ... for only , like , 42 more hours .
there' s 20 minutes left till curfew .
let' s get ice cream .
satisfy your sugar cravings .
no , thanks .
you don' t have to do this .
do what ?
how do you know what i have to do ?
have you ever left rehab ?
no , but l
you' ve never left rehab , so you don' t know what you' re talking about .
true , but i have been a part of some very emotional sing outs
i' m sorry .
that' s right .
you sang " lean on me " a few times .
the stupidest cheesy song ever .
you must know about leaving rehab better than anyone .
i got an eyelash .
make a wish .
custody of my kids .
sobriety .
come on , baby .
we all want that .
think of something else .
my foreskin back .
no one asked me before they took it .
they just took it .
way to share , gerhardt .
way to share .
okay , here we go .
all gone .
read the sign .
betty , where' s the love ?
daniel , wow .
guzzling gwen .
what happened ?
this ?
i honest to god don' t know .
well , it' s really nice to see you .
get a room .
oh , my god , it' s a joke !
it' s a miracle !
oh , you know what ?
i could use your medical expertise , if you got a second .
i got a second .
use a condom .
ah , two !
two in one day !
gerhardt ?
i wrote this for andrea' s going away , and that is for you .
am i the lead ?
yes .
if you could do that , that would be great .
i should direct this .
you don' t want me .
you' il be great .
gwen , i' il ruin it .
you get to wear lipstick .
really ?
so just think meryl streep .
think cry in th e dark .
remember ?
dingo stole my baby .
a dingo stole my baby .
andrea d. , mail pickup at the parker cabin , main room .
okay , go .
go , go .
gerhardt , come on !
all right .
okay .
watch the phone .
somebody sent you a cute little monkey .
we used to make those here .
they' re real easy .
you take a string , tie it around the toes .
becomes the head .
and arms
come here .
sit down .
hello , everybody .
my name' s gwen .
i' m an alcoholic and an addict .
but i guess you already know that .
in honor of andrea' s departure ... ... instead of singing " lean on me " yet again ... ... we have our own version of santa cruz .
i hope you like it .
and now ... ... santa booze .
oh , falcon .
i am so afraid .
when they find i' ve taken you out of the hospital ... ... mother and dr. griffin hartley are sure to come here .
what will we do ?
if i can' t be without
with you .
if i can' t be with you , i would rather be dead .
but , dear god , the tiny clusters of tumors in my brain .
oh , god , the tiny little clusters of tumors in his brain !
somebody , help !
oh , god !
wait ... ... l have some pills that ....
i' m okay .
it' s okay .
i' m okay .
oh , falcon ... ... hold me .
i knew we' d find you two together .
darian , your lover ... ... is also your sister !
no !
it' s not possible .
it is not possible .
deirdre , darling , i have some bad news .
your daughter , darian , falcon' s lover and sister ... ... is also carrying my baby .
no !
no !
oh , god !
get out of here !
get out of here !
all right .
i got no problem getting out of here .
i' il do this .
what are you doing ?
improvising .
they do that on soaps .
what are you doing ?
just improvising .
go with it .
oh !
but , no , my tumors !
it' s the melio ....
melagioma nestrocytroma .
whatever .
i' m sorry .
there' s nothing i can do .
what are you doing ?
it says in the script that we kiss .
i like you , bon voyage , but i' m not kissing gerhardt .
okay , everybody .
excellent work .
that was really good sharing .
i really enjoyed that .
good use of feeling words and all that .
give me more .
who are you ?
evelyn .
don' t you recognize the hat ?
okay , but seeing as you' re all addicts ... ... drugs , sex , the same story line for 1 6 years ... ... here are some therapeutic tools to keep you going .
sometimes you gotta kiss ass before you can kick it .
it' s the engine that kills you , not the caboose .
make love , not war .
don' t ever be someone' s slogan , because you are poetry .
thank you .
you' re welcome .
you missed a damn fine show .
all your favorite characters were there .
yeah , well , i' m happy for you .
you can' t still be mad at me .
listen , i' m sorry i said that .
you' re not dense .
you' re great .
and ....
that' s why i didn' t want to rehash ... ... my entire disgusting history in front of you , because ....
and what you' il think .
you' il just
i know people' s perceptions of girls who screw other girls ' boyfriends .
i know what the world' s perception is on somebody who goes into a bar ... ... and realizes hours later i' ve left my 3 year old godson in the car .
people don' t like people like that .
i don' t like people like that .
those are just things you' ve done .
not who you are .
people make mistakes , you know ?
who you are is just fine .
more than fine .
jasper .
what are you doing here ?
i was looking for you .
successfully , as it turns out .
i meant , why aren' t you at your parents ' house ?
i realized , what with them being completely senile ... ... l could thank them for a great time , they' il think i made the trip .
see , i thought you might be lonely .
this is eddie .
he' s a patient here .
and he' s from oklahoma .
how do you do , eddie from oklahoma ?
i' m jasper .
i' il leave you guys to it , then .
hang on , i don' t know about that .
you see , the way i see it , gwennie , we' ve got two options here .
we let eddie head off to the showers ... ... wash off that manly sweat , and we could bullshit our way through the day .
we could acknowledge the awkward situation we' re in .
i don' t know what you mean .
that' s a clear vote for scenario 1 .
how about you , eddie from oklahoma ?
care to weigh in ?
abstaining ? lnteresting .
that leaves only me in favor of calling a spade a spade .
and saying , pardon me , but i' d prefer if you wouldn' t sleep with my fiance .
you got the wrong idea here , pal .
don' t call me " pal .
i' m not your pal .
and don' t treat me like an idiot .
do me that one courtesy , because i' m not that , either .
in fact , i' ve got more brain cells ... ... than your entire redneck family all put together .
don' t be a jerk .
gwen , don' t be a slut .
back off , pal .
go .
go .
let me see it .
let me just  get off !
let' s put some ice on it .
come on .
this way .
honey , wake up .
somebody !
somebody !
come !
gwen , what is it ?
go back in your rooms !
what did you do ?
your hands are so cold .
hurry up !
what happened ?
she took that .
well , what ?
i don' t know what this is !
get somebody !
we have an emergency .
send an ambulance .
let me in .
get back in your rooms !
oh , jesus .
i' d rath erbe dreaming than living
living' s just too hard to do
it' s chances , not choices
noises , not voices
a day' s just a thing to get thro ugh
living' s just too hard to do
dreams might be pretend
but at least dreams end
and ljust can' t stop thinking , you see
th ought' s a small comfort to me
we as a community have all been deeply affected by our loss .
i' d like to begin with how i feel .
and that' s ... ... scared .
because i' ve heard so many people here say , " i just want to use one more time .
andrea' s " one more time " was what killed her .
she didn' t kill herself .
she used .
she overdosed .
that' s what happens ....
there' s nothing ... ... you or i or anybody could' ve done about it .
it' s important .
you need to understand this .
it' s me .
what happened ?
are you all right ?
gwennie ?
i' m sorry .
i don' t know ....
you want to know how i feel ?
how i always felt around you ?
small .
you have this ... ... way .
you know , it' s that mom thing .
that amazing gravitational force .
even when she was a mess , you know , the world noticed her .
you have that .
and i guess ... ... l figured that you always knew that .
i don' t know .
when i went back home ... ... l started thinking .
and maybe you don' t know that ... ... about yourself .
i mean , who would' ve told you , you know ?
not me .
the only thing i ever told you was ... ... what a pain in the ass you were .
i am a pain in the ass .
even a pain in the ass needs ... ... someone ... ... to take care of them .
i didn' t do that .
i didn' t ... ... and i should have .
i should have helped you with your homework .
i should have walked you home after school .
sometimes i' d be walking with my friends , and i' d see you ... ... half a block ahead , all alone .
you were so little .
well , so were you .
i never asked for help , so ....
but you needed it .
didn' t you ?
and everybody does .
yep .
i' m sorry i make it so impossible to love me .
you make it impossible for me not to love you .
ninety meetings in ninety days .
and ask for help .
it' s always there .
anything else ?
just goodbye .
jeremiah was a bullfrog
was a good friend ofmine
i never understood a single word he said
but i help ed him drink his wine
and he always had some mighty fine wine
take care , sweetie .
joy to th e world
all th e boys and girls
joy to th e fishes ln th e deep blue sea
joy to you and me
ifl were th e king of th e world
i' il tell you what i' d do
i' d thro w away th e cars and th e bras and th e war
and make sweet love to you
look , i messed up .
i got riled up .
there isn' t a lot i can do about it now , except to say i' m sorry .
and you know , people make mistakes .
if you can' t handle that , if you ....
if you want to decide that ... ... my messing up means i' m not worth being your friend ... ... then you' re not as smart as you think you are .
that guy , jasper .
i don' t know him .
but i do know that he is dangerous for you .
wait .
turkey .
meant to be symbolic of my behavior last time we saw each other .
i tried to track down some roasted asshole , but ....
listen , all right ?
i' ve been thinking about us .
i can change if you want me to .
and we can have a totally different life .
all right ?
i' il buy running shoes .
we' il take up yoga or jogging .
we' il be organized .
pay our bills , floss our teeth .
we won' t set fire to the apartment anymore .
i' il buy a goldfish , and we' il be like normal people .
you hate normal people .
no .
what i hate is being without you .
you don' t want to do this on your own , do you ?
we have to go .
ten people die , but 500 people have an amazing time ... ... chasing this cheese in the middle of the cotswolds .
the only person who dies , should really die , is old women .
jasper , do you ever shut up ?
i' m sorry .
but it' s just that , you know , if i' m gonna really
stay clean and sober , as they say in the program .
yeah .
but it' s not that simple .
everything has to be different .
absolutely .
and that includes us .
i' m trying to change things in me .
i' m trying to  look who' s here .
hey , marty .
elaine , look .
i was hoping i' d find you here .
my god , she' s alive .
gwennie' s back in action .
celebrate with us .
we got a monster table going in the back .
excellent idea .
we' re in the middle of something now .
oh , come on , gwennie .
give us a couple of minutes .
we' il be over .
that was really embarrassing .
where are you going ?
