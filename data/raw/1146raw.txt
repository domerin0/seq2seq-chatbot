i' il tell you this about my father .
aah !
he had a heart of gold .
he was honest to a fault .
and he almost always smelt like talcum powder .
he just really loved his johnson' s baby powder .
no , but , i mean , like , a lot .
he' d sprinkle the stuff on himself ... over himself , under himself ... and then just for good measure , under himself again .
because , as he was fond of saying , " you never know .
to this day , if you cover my eyes and put me across the room ...
i couldn' t tell you the difference between ... a freshly bathed baby and my father' s balls .
i' m not saying that' s a healthy thing .
i' m just saying it' s something i remember .
the best time i ever had with my father ... was when he was having maybe the worst time of his life .

and you would really go live on a farm ?
it' s not a farm .
it' s a farmhouse .
farmhouse ... it' s a house with land .
it' s just a ... you know ... it' s something we' ve been talking about for a while , and ... and ...
' cause i don' t know if we want the girls to grow up in this city .
i mean , is that ...
well , the suburbs i could understand .
yeah , but i just like the idea of the country .
you know ?
it appeals to me .
you know , it' s ... it' s safe , it' s quiet .
i could do my writing there .
what does that mean , a farm ?
you' d have like , what , chickens ?
no , no , no .
not chickens .
it' s not a farm .
it' s just ...
yeah , i mean , you could grow stuff if you want .
you could grow tomatoes or corn or something , i' m sure .
in upstate new york ?
yeah , you could ...
why not ?
well , new jersey has the fantastic corn .
all right , well , you know what ?
the point isn' t to grow corn ...
new york is , i think , maybe too cold for corn .
forget i said corn .
drop the corn .
the point is the house .
you go , and it' s a house in the country , so ...
it sounds like a nice thing .
yeah , i understand .
just a quiet place in the country .
yeah , yeah .
that' s all .
a house in the country .
well , you' re not gonna buy it without looking at it first , though , right ?
what are we doing ?
we' re going ...
we' re driving to go look at it , right ?
' cause , you know , you never know .
no , i know .
i know .
so , what do you know ?
i had a thought , but no one wanted to hear it .
what ?
well , if she' s that fed up with your father ... wouldn' t she maybe want to look up an old boyfriend or something ?
no .
that' s my mother we' re talking about .
i' m not saying she had a lover or anything .
please .
please .
whoever she' s gonna call is already married or dead .
i should just turn around and come home right now , shouldn' t i ?
no , no .
let us look for her .

i love you .

the big stores ...
you know , in the mall , they' re not gonna ...

john grisham .
my god .

he' s fast .
he' s fast .
how' d you know it was me ?
i think this is it .
wow .
plenty of room here .
look at this !
do you believe this is all the same place ?
lot of mowing and pruning .
you' re gonna have to get one of those mowers with a chair on it .
ha ha ha !
oh , wow .
so , this would be the driveway .
you hear that ?
listen to that .
the pebbles against the tires .
gravel is good .
oh , yeah .
oh , i like this .
i like this .
mr. harrison ?

mr. kleinman ?
yes , sir !
that' s me .
hi .
ben kleinman .
well , hello .
hi .
this is my father .
sam kleinman .
how are you ?
pleasure .
you' ve got a spectacular place here .
thank you .
yes , sir .
uh ... oh , uh , i' il tell you ... why don' t you two fellas talk , and i' il just mosey around ?
terrific .
great .
thank you .
well , shall i show you around ?
please .
that would be just terrific .
how was your trip up ?
all right ?
my great grandmother' s family ... gave her this land on her eighteenth birthday .
is that right ?
huh .
and my great grandfather built the house with his own hands .
really ?
right after the civil war .
wow .
it' s just ...
it' s a magical place .
it' s important that you feel that way .
oh , i do .
i do .
heh .
my father and i shot moose and wild boar ... just inside those woods over there .
wow .
heh .
the moose are gone now , by and large .
time marches on , with or without our consent .
hmm .
i will tell you this , though ... whoever lives here next ... will have the finest golden corner of god' s green earth .
boy , you got some place here !
that lake ?
ooh !
we' ve been very blessed .
let me ask you something .
the septic tank ... what kind of system did they put in here ?
do you know ?
i beg your pardon ?
i mean , it doesn' t drain right into the lake , does it ?
because i see the other houses up on the hill there ... and i got to figure , if all that' s draining into your water ... oh , boy .
come the hot weather , this place is gonna stink to high hell .
let me tell you something .
if a guy is selling you a house , and he don' t want you to ask questions ... you don' t want the house .
right .
am i wrong ?
no .
i' m saying ... you' re right .
your old man is not as dumb as you think , you know .
your mother and i , we looked at a house once .
i know .
lakewood .
lakewood , new jersey .
that' s right .
we got the money into escrow , we run an inspection ... what do we find ?
rats .
you' d better believe it .
floor to ceiling .
the place was infested .
so believe me , there is always a reason .
always .
you' re darn tootin ' .
there' s always a reason .
right .
and there' s never not a reason .
what ?
right ?
so , what you' re saying is , there really ... there is no house ... that anyone could buy anywhere , ever .
what ?
right ?
i mean , all over the world .
all over the world , no matter where ... no matter when , there just is no house ... that anybody should buy , you' re saying ... because it ... it' s always a trick .
there' s always some kind of scam .
what are you talking about ?
so , therefore ... therefore , what ?
don' t even try ?
try what ?
i don' t know what you' re saying now .
that' s your big plan , is don' t have a dream ...
' cause if you have a dream , it' il only turn to shit .
yeah , just leave things how they are .
we' il leave things how they are ... nice ... and then wait till it' s too late .
till what' s too late ?
yeah , just wait till everybody' s dead , right ?
what are you gettin ' so upset about ?
ok , that' s why mom left .
why ?
you want to know why ?
because of this .
because of what ?
because of this .
because of you .
you got a reason not to do everything .
whatever it is , there' s a reason ...
no , you can' t do that .
she wanted a house in the country ... but you said , " no , the kids are too little .
right ?
and then , all of a sudden ...
no , the kids are grown up .
we don' t need a house in the country .
she wanted to travel , but no ...
this place is too far .
that place , it' s not far enough .
right ?
the winter ... it' s too cold .
the summer ... it' s so crowded there .
the spring ... it' s rainy .
whatever it is .
but you know what ?
somebody goes to these places !
somebody' s buying these houses in the country !
so i gotta think it can' t be that fucking horrible !
you know , you' re talkin ' out of your ass ...
oh , am i ?
yeah , ok .
when you' re married forty years , come talk to me .
please .
it' s not the forty years .
it was always like this .
you know that .
oh , really ?
yes , yes .
it was like this before i was born .
how do you know what the hell things were like before you were born ?
l ...
i ...
just trust me , i know .
i know .
you know ?
yes , i know .
well , i' m telling you you don' t know what you' re talking about .
oh , ok .
i don' t know what i' m talking about ?
do me a favor .
really ?
why don' t you close your mouth and drive me back to the city ?
i don' t know what i' m talking about ?
good .
now , let me show you something .
let' s take a look .
let' s see how much i don' t know .
keep your eye on the road !
watch where you' re driving !
i want you to see something .
hey .
hey !
jesus !
shit !
whew .
you all right ?
yeah .
yeah .
you ok ?
i' m fine .
jesus .
oh , boy .
that' s good .
hey .
a new car you can always get .
i' m sorry .
so , what were you gonna show me ?
nothing .
now you got my attention .
heh .
ok .
what' s this ?
it' s for you .
from you ?
it' s from mom .
what , she' s leaving me again now ?
it was so much fun the first time ?
she wrote this ...
she wrote this the year i was born .
she wrote it , but she never gave it to you .
so , how did you get it ?
when i was fourteen , i was digging around in her nightstand drawer .
i was gonna steal a cigarette .
your mother doesn' t smoke .
not smoke smoke , but she used to ... once in a while .
she had the same pack of newport lights in there for seven years .
i never knew your mother smoked .
well , there you go .
so , you took this ?
yeah .
i still don' t know if she ever noticed it was gone .
and you keep this in the car ?
no .
i don' t keep it in the c ...
i dug it up to show it to you , because i thought ...
' cause i ...
i don' t know why .
because i figured it was time .
march 18 ...
but that' s two weeks before you were born .
why ...
just read .
sam ... this is the letter that should be pinned to a pillow ... explaining why the wife has run off and left her husband .
but i have nobody to run off with ... nor can i run off .
apparently , my life isn' t even my own to do away with .
in my heart , i must take leave of you now ... because unless i disentangle myself from you emotionally ...
i' il never be a fit mother for our children .
i don' t think you could measure all the tears i' ve shed .
when i' ve needed you most ... you have found it more pressing to be anywhere else but with me .
but i know it wasn' t always so .
i know the world was once vibrant with promise .
after all , wasn' t i the girl , fresh out of college ... who got the job at the very first interview she ever had ?
so what if i cancelled my plans to go see the world' s fair in queens ?
i was working in manhattan ... and making $13 a week to boot .
and how thrilling that you , a handsome young boss ... were interested in me .
when you went in the army ...
i did everything i could to keep that office running ... because i was sure this was the way to your heart .
how all the more humiliating it was for me , then ... to watch you spend your weekend furloughs ... catching up on business ... while i got the final fifteen minutes at penn station ... before you shipped out again .
i must have loved you an awful lot to have been so hurt .
in fact , sometimes i almost wish ... you would have yourself a love affair ... so that you would know how the heart can be affected .
oh , i guess you loved me in your way ... as part of the whole picture ... a comfortable life taken for granted .
but believe me , it' s not enough .
maybe it' s all i' m meant to get ... but , please , don' t let anybody ever treat our girls this way .
from here on , i' il stop hoping you' il change .
i won' t expect evenings to be different from each other ... nor weekends different from workdays .
i won' t expect anything anymore .
but you have destroyed a marriage .
congratulations .
you finally have your son .
i hope he brings you much pleasure .
as for me , i' m glad he' s here ... but i still miss your tenderness ... your thoughtfulness , even your politeness .
i don' t know if you have it in you , but i yearn for it .
maybe someday , when you have nothing else on your mind .
bullshit .
what ?
bullshit .
what do you mean , bullshit ?
i' m saying that this is a crock of b u l i ... bullshit !
that is not the way it was .
how what was ?
all of it !
well ...
bullshit !
you think it was like that ?
i don' t know what it was like , but that' s ... that' s what she wrote .
i mean , that' s ... that' s what she felt .
that i' m a prick ?
your father is such a callous ... uncaring son of a bitch ... that he ruined the marriage ... that he made your mother that miserable ?
let me tell you something , sonny boy .
i busted my ass building that business .
you' re damn right .
you know what crown carpet was when we started ?
two guys , a desk , and a clipboard .
that was it !
did i have to stay at the office late a lot ?
you bet i did .
did i have to travel all over the goddamn place ... here and there , drummin ' up business ?
you bet i did .
because that' s what had to be done !
so , did i miss out on a lot of nice things ?
yes , i missed out on a lot of nice things .
does that make me uncaring ?
a rotten husband ?
a rotten father ?
crown carpets fed you kids ... sent you to the best schools , the best summer camps .
who of your friends ever went away to such nice places , huh ?
mexico , puerto rico that time ...
hershey , pennsylvania .
who was that for ?
for me ?
i need to take a vacation to see another factory ?
to see how they make chocolate ?
i don' t give a shit how they make it , but i went for you and for the family .
don' t you dare tell me i wasn' t there for you kids .
she never got to go to the world' s fair .
that' s my fault .
fifty years later .
you want to go to the world' s fair ?
go !
who' s stopping you ?
that i had an affair .
bullshit !
no , she didn' t say that you had an ...
never !
she said that ...
never !
what she said was she almost wishes you had .
she wishes i had .
what kind of craziness is that ?
she wishes you had , so then you would' ve known what ... what it ...
that is pure crazy shit .
never so much as a dalliance .
never .
the other fellas , yes .
i' m not saying it' s unheard of in the office .
i' m not an innocent .
bernie kaye ... you remember bernie kaye , the sales rep ?
shtupped everything that moved between baltimore and syracuse .
legendary cocksman .
boasted about it .
and his wife , by the way , adores him .
thinks he' s the greatest thing since ovaltine .
but me ... me , who never once so much as laid a finger on another woman ... me , your mother had to run away from after 47 years ... because i' m such an unconscionable prick .
well , maybe i shouldn' t have shown you ...
you' re damn right you shouldn' t have shown me !
and look at your car !
you gonna call somebody to fix it ?
i' m gonna call ...
or is it gonna fix by itself sitting there ?
i' m gonna call someone .
good , because i' m goddamn hungry now .
and aggravated .
and i have to pee .
and you know what ?
i' m gonna pee right here .
go ahead .
you' re damn right i' m goin ' ahead !
and i don' t need permission from you .
you hear that , everybody ? !
sam kleinman , fair lawn , new jersey ... and i' m gonna pee wherever i goddamn please !
that really burns my ass .
i' m not polite ?
who' s more polite than me ?
come on , tell me .
that really burns my ass .
you' re lucky i heard the phone when i did .
i was nearly halfway to my car .
we' re closed for the night .
what do you mean , closed ?
but you' re ... you' re gonna fix this first , right ?
my wife is making chicken paprikash , and that is one dish i do not want to miss .
ok .
all right , but can you just ...
you know what ?
if you can just get it so i can drive it out of here ...
oh , there' s no way we can do anything tonight .
you come back in the morning .
i' il be here at the crack of 7 : 00 .
oh , no , no .
no , no , no , no , no .
i can' t stay .
come on .

you see his phone ringing off the hook ?
just wanted you to know your dinner' s cold ... and the children all agree you' re a shitheel .
you hearing this ?
yeah .

when nightly news continues ...
you go , tom .
you do whatever you have to do .
i' il wait right here for you .
wait , that' s the other line .

ok , your sisters are like little detectives now .
hang on .

i' m here .
hey , look at that .
all right , where is mom gonna go ?
where has she always wanted to go ?
my first thought was france ... because , you know , dad never wanted to go there .
but then i thought , maybe california .
why ?
well , you know those friends of hers ... the husband' s a periodontist ?
the schechners ?
oh , the schechners .
that' s it .
i could not think of their names .
she' s gonna leave her husband of 47 years ... to be with marty and charlotte schechner ?
well , it' s possible , no ?
yeah , but she' s always talking about them .
hold on a second .

i' m in the kitchen .
i open up mom' s desk drawer ... big color travel brochure for africa .
africa ?

i saw the brochure .
come , visit majestic africa .
and she' s got , like , safari prices circled .
mom is not going to africa .
you see , i think i have to agree with that one .
well , i talked to bonnie , and she doesn' t believe ...
mom would actually leave the country .
thinks she probably went to a spa or something .
like , maybe florida .
ok , good .
so , paris , kenya ... and boca raton we got it narrowed down to .
nobody' s going to boca raton this time of the year .
it' s 130 degrees there .

ok , buy the car .
oh , yeah .
this car rides like a dream .
mmm .
you smell that leather ?
i do .
you see , it still has the old smell .
why that is , i don' t know .
you would think , fifty years , it would lose the smell , but there it is ... that good ford smell .
you know , he was a big anti semite , ford .
you' ve mentioned this , yes .
yeah , but he made some beautiful cars .
yes , he did .
you know , your mother hates the way i drive .
i know , i know .
you' re driving too fast , " " there' s a curb there .
i understand .
hey , listen .
" that was a stop sign .
ok , hey , believe me , i' ve driven with you two .
it' s not a picnic , by the way .
now let me ask you .
you' re sitting there .
what ?
am i such a terrible driver ?
no , you' re not .
look at the road .
thank you .
oh , i love this car .
the first one of these i saw , this kid at school had one .
went out with this gorgeous girl , marion savara .
her name i remember .
my god , what a knockout .
yeah ?
he would pull up in this big shiny car , open her door ... and out would come these legs .
marion savara .
marion savara .
i danced with her once .
that was about it .
you know why ?
you didn' t have this car then .
you' re exactly right .
you see , everybody' s got something .
your mother never got to the world' s fair .
i never got a shot at marion savara .
what are you going to do ?
what are you going to do ?
look at us .
wherever we want , whenever we want , huh ?
ha ha ha .
did you ever do this with your dad ?
my dad ?

and did you resent that ?
oh , here we go .
no , no , no .
no , no , no .
i wasn' t saying anything .
resent him ?
what do you mean , resent ?
no , i didn' t resent him .
that' s the way it was .
he was my father .
yeah , i know .
why ?
do you resent me ?
no , no .
no , no , no , no , no .
because , you know , we never did this before today , either .
no , i know .
of course .
i just ...
it' s just something i think about all the time now with my kids .
they' re growing up , and i' m always thinking ... you know , what are they going to remember ?
are we going to take them places ...
are we going to do things that they wished we didn' t do ... or are there going to be things we didn' t do ... that they' re going to grow up and say , " hey , how come we never did that ?
you know ?
is this what you do in therapy ?
no , no , no , no .
it' s ...
none of it ...
what is it that we didn' t do ?
who ?
me ... with you and the girls .
no , you ...
what did we forget to do ?
no , nothing .
we didn' t forget .
no , i' m curious .
i don' t know .
we ...
we never went camping .
camping ?
who the hell goes camping ?
sleep outside and crap in a bush ?
all right , well , then we' il forget about that .
oh , sorry .
i thought ...
no .
no , no , no , no , no , no , no .
i just ...
i wasn' t making a joke .
it' s not important .
you always picture fathers and sons , right ?
that' s the thing you' re supposed to do .
you go camping together and fishing at the fishing hole .
ok .
come on .
what are ...
what are you doing ?
what are you doing ?
i don' t want you to resent we never fished .
here .
no , that' s part of the feather .
what ?
that' s decoration .
mmm , i think you' re wrong .
oh .
see ?
it dangles down .
oh , my god .
you know , there' s a lot of pockets here .
here .
ok , now look .
you see ?
it goes right there .
there ?
yeah .
right ...
right there ?
yes .
that' s not the hole .
what do you mean , it' s not the hole ?
there' s got to be a thing where you ...
yes , it is .
of course .
wait a minute .
where does the worm go ?
there' s no worms .
this is instead of worms .
they forgot the worms ?
they didn' t forget .
this is better than worms .
worms is the old ...
this is what they do now .
oh , no worms .
yeah .
remember the guy told us ?
you almost never use worms .
how about this here ?
that' s big .
oh ?
the bigger the thing , the bigger the fish , no ?
hmm ?
what if a little fish swallows it ?
it could choke .
see ?
l ...
wait .
does a fish smell ?
they don' t smell it , they see it .
how could they smell under the water ?
i don' t know .
the ...
under the water don' t smell ?

oh , boy .
no , no , no .
i just got to put ...

oh , boy .
all right , hold on .
oh , boy .
ok .

nothing .
all right .
so , this is what it is .
i guess .
yeah .
oh , my god .
what ?
i think you just shot the first three bars of moonlight in vermont there .
there' s nobody here .
who am i bothering ?
how are your toes ?
not bad .
oh , i think i actually got something here .
hold him up .

huh ?

what are you doing ?
he' s still alive .
of course he' s still alive .
i just pulled him out of ...
what are you hitting him for ?
i' m not hitting him .
yeah , you just smacked ...
why would you hit a fish ?
poor thing can' t breathe .
oh , what , and you think hitting him' s going to help him ?
give me the thing .
give me the thing .
don' t ...
don' t hit him .
don' t ...
don' t hurt it .
i' il let him catch his breath a little .
what ?
not his breath ... but you know what i mean .
yeah , little fishy .
you want to go , huh ?
you want to go ?
go ahead .
we were just kidding .
you had enough fishing ?
i could be done .
huh ?
yeah , he' s ... he' s all right , actually .
i' m better than all right .
this is the best i' ve been since i don' t know when .
your mother should leave me more often .
mom should leave him more often , he said .
why do you keep saying what i' m saying ?
let me talk .
all right , he wants to talk to you .
i don' t know .
hello , sweetheart .
listen , if your husband doesn' t check in every 45 minutes ... you won' t be beside yourself with worry .
i agree with you 100 % .
ha ha ha .
all right .
bye bye .
and what ?
she' s a very sweet girl , your wife .
agree what ?
what' d she just say to you ?
she said you can be quite a pain in the ass ... and i shouldn' t take it personal .
so sweet .
wait a minute , wait a minute .
listen to you .
now , the point is , if a person is determined ... to be unhappy and angry their whole life ... then you know what ?
that' s their problem .
jeez , pop .
what ?
so , if mom was unhappy , you didn' t care ?
i never said i didn' t care .
you just said , if she' s unhappy , that' s her problem .
that' s her problem , that' s right .
ok .
what ?
so i' m the schmuck ?
no , but ...
no , it' s my fault .
she' s unhappy because of me , right ?
no , i didn' t say that .
well , that' s what you think .
no .
no , i' m not saying that .
yes , it is .
come on , that' s what you think .
no , but i ...
well , i' m going to tell you something now that i never said before .
i think she was unhappy already when i met her .
that' s right .
and all the time before that , growing up .
i think she was an unhappy girl .
remember her father ?
no .
he ...
he was ...
he died .
oh , yeah , of course .
yeah .
well , he was a real sourpuss of a guy .
nice enough , but a sourpuss .
and your grandmother , well ... she wasn' t the cheeriest person in the world , either .
i' m not saying they didn' t have problems ... but it was not a happy house .
and your mother , by the time she set out into the world ... she already had this , i don' t know ...
i just never got the impression she was ever happy .
well , maybe that explains ... why she wanted so much to be happy with you .
ok .
ok .
huh ?
but , listen .
i was in the same marriage ... and i was happy .
yes , you were happy , but that' s the point .
well , the point is , see ... if you had made just , like , a little more of an effort ...
oh , peaches .
oh , my god .
that' s a peach .
you' re really not going to try one ?
can' t .
allergic .
still ?
so juicy and sweet .
what do they do to them ?
nothing .
they just picked it , so it' s fresh .

they picked it there , they put it in a bushel .

how can you still be allergic ?
how ?
i don' t know .

i wish i could .
it makes my ears itch .
when' s the last time you tried it ?
1972 .
oh , for god' s sake .
people outgrow allergies , you know .

i' m afraid i' il get that ...
you don' t know what you' re missing .

here , here .
take a bite .
go ahead .
oh , my god .
you see what i' m saying ?
live a little .

you see , if your mother were here , she' d say ...
sam , you' ve had enough .
two peaches are plenty .
but you know what ?
i' m having another one .
what do you think of that ?
really , i wouldn' t have believed it .
how can you have allergies ?
nobody has allergies when i' m the father .
i don' t have ' em .
your sisters don' t have ' em .
all right , all right .
no need to get snippy .
here we go .
for relief of watery eyes ... scratchy throat , and other hay fever symptoms .
but your eyes , they aren' t watery , are they ?
it' s all right .

yes .

explain that to me .
what ?
the holes in those jeans .

and can only afford ripped clothing .
that' s correct , sir .
and she doesn' t mind that we can see her ass peeking out like that ?
no , she does not .

see , my husband was the same ... travel , work , work , travel ... and then one day i realized ... you know , ok , i' m just going to have to make my own amusement .
so , that' s when i started my correspondence courses ... and i started my gardening .
see , that' s healthy to me .
i mean , that i understand .
yeah , you should see her tomatoes and zucchinis .
they' re , like , freaky big .
my mom ...
i remember once , i was over the house ...
everything all right here , gentlemen ?
we' re good .
and she was , like , " where is your father ?
i' ve had dinner on the table since 6 : 00 .
i said , " ma , he' s never been home at 6 : 00 ...
and he never will , you know , so why don' t you just accept it ...
and spare yourself all the heartache ?
i mean , just make your life a little easier .
you know what she says ?
what ?
because i like to think there' s always hope .
yeah .
ok .
so now you see what i was dealing with .
there' s always hope .
right .
so let me ask you .
who' s crazy ?
nobody' s crazy .
no ?
no .
after all those years ... she' s still waiting for me to be different ?
i mean , i' ve been exactly the same the whole time .
i' m not pulling any surprises , but still she' s surprised .
i know , and that' s what breaks my heart .
what ?
because she' s hope ...
i mean , all ...
i don' t know .
aren' t we supposed to have hope ?
isn' t that what sustains us ?
isn' t that what keeps mankind going forward ?
this is a perfect medium rare .
pop , i' m asking ...
what ?
mankind , you said .
ok .
all right .
people hope for world peace , right ?
now , do they really think it' s gonna work out ?
no , probably not , but they still ... they keep praying , right ?
they keep hoping .
yeah , but i' m not world peace , i' m her husband .
and one person could never be ... exactly what another person expects them to be .
because it' s not reasonable .
am i right or wrong ?
yes , but still ...
this is fantastic .
here , taste this .
come on , you got ...
i have the same thing .
never mind .
taste mine .
i have the exact ...
this is out of this world !
huh ?
it' s exactly the same that i have .
if you' il excuse me , i' m gonna go ...
oh .
sure .
yeah , yeah .
oh , yeah .
so , let me ask you ... you married another woman , let' s say ...
mom married another guy , right ?
so everything was different .
what is it with you ?
i' m just gonna go with her .
yeah , yeah , sure .
what did we do ?
we scared ' em away ?
what do you mean , what is it with me ?
what ?
finish your question .
what ?
what is it that you' re so concerned ... what happened between your mother and me ?
what do you mean , why am i so concerned ?
that' s the whole freakin ' thing .
what' s the difference ?
that' s the whole thing of my life .
that' s the ... that' s the ... that' s the big white elephant in our house .
what was ?
the shit .
all the shit between you and ma .
there was no shit .
there was no shit ?
where was there shit ?
everywhere you looked there was shit .
bullshit .
oh , come on .
all right , we didn' t talk about it , but you don' t think we saw it ?
you don' t think we all saw the ... the finger pointing ... and the rolling of the eyes ?
hey , i loved your mother .
i know .
i still love your mother .
i know .
and she loves me .
absolutely , yes .
so , what are you saying ?
i' m saying , look how much love was wasted .
i mean , an abundance of love ... quashed by a quagmire of shit .
i' m opening my pants .
go ahead .
oy .
ok , so ...
ok , so let me ask you something .
you' re such an expert .
you and your wife ...
yeah ?
you don' t have any shit ?
of course we do .
right .
and you handle all your shit perfect ?
no , not perfect , but i ...
what ?
you what ?
all right .
like this house in the country ?
do i need that ?
no .
but it' s important to her .
so i' m , i ...
i listen to her .
so , really ... she should thank me , your wife .
hmm ?
if i didn' t set such a bad example ... you wouldn' t be knocking yourself out for her .
well , i ... you know , you' re joking .
i don' t know , maybe .
i mean , a lot of times ...
any more sourdough bread for you gentlemen ?
we' re good .
7 grain cheese rolls , sesame onion bread sticks ?
nothing .
no .
we' re really fine .
a lot of times it' s just little stuff .
i try to do little things .
you know ... surprises or little presents ... or i write her little cards .
which , you know ...
see , you ... you were never a big card guy .
so shoot me .
hey , you asked me , " like what ?
so i' m telling you .
believe me , little cards , little papers ... whatever the hell you' re talking about ... believe me , that would not miraculously have made your mother happy .
really ?
that' s right .
whatever it is that she needed , i didn' t have it to give to her .
ok .
and when she didn' t get it from you ... who do you think she turned to next , huh ?
who do you think she turned to next ?
who ?
me .
you ?
yeah .
well , all of us .
really with me more than the girls , even .
why ?
because you' re a boy ?
yeah .
because ... yeah .
i mean , some ...
what the hell happened to them ?
somebody had to make her happy , right ?
guess what ?
i tried .
believe me , i tried .
that cloud , that ... that veil of disappointment ...
i could never make it go away .
i could never crack that sadness there .
so you know what i' m talking about .
yes , i do .
and i also know that ... she wouldn' t have needed anything from me if she got it ...
we also have a lovely ...
walk away !
just walk away .
she wouldn' t have needed anything from me ... if she got it from you .
is that right ?
yes , that' s right .
and i' m tired of feeling like the fuckin ' failure here ...
' cause i' m not the one who failed her , you are .
you are .
you never cared .
you just went about your business ... and , " oh , everything will work out fine in the end .
but you know what ?
it doesn' t .
it doesn' t work like that .
you have to ... you have to care .
you have to try and give a shit .
huh ?
look at that letter .
i mean , she was screaming for you , and you didn' t hear it .
and now you' re surprised ?
forty years later , your wife is ...
god knows where she is ... trying to figure out ... why her life didn' t work out like she planned ... and you think that' s got nothing to do with you , huh ?
it' s got everything to do with you .
you didn' t do your job .
that' s right .
you didn' t do your job .
ohh !
uhh !
hey .
what a waste of a good steak .
i' m an asshole .
no .
yeah , yeah .
listen , i ...
i had no right saying all that .
no .
no , no , i didn' t .
no , you' re entitled .
and i' m gonna tell you something else .
maybe you' re right .
maybe i could' ve done better , maybe i should' ve ... but i didn' t .
so you know what ?
i' m sorry .
ok .
you think the girls are worried about us ?
i think they' il be all right .
unh .
do you know ... that was the first time since roosevelt died ... that i danced with someone besides your mother ?
and ?
i didn' t like it .
it felt wrong ... wrong skin , wrong smell .
the height , her hands .
didn' t feel right .
oh , what' s she doing , benny ?
she' s gonna live by herself ?
she' s gonna find someone else she likes better ?
now ?
you know , we' re not kids anymore , your mother and me .
you want to change your life , do it when you' re young .
ugh !
i don' t know .
i don' t know what she wants .
i don' t know what i did .
i don' t know anything .
ahh , unh !
are your stars moving around all cock eyed ?
yep .
me , too .
oh , you' re a bad influence , sonny boy .
you made your old man drunk .
well ... sorry .
what' s that ?
the big dipper ?
where are you looking ?
what , here ?
over here .
this one ?
yeah .
uh ...
i don' t know .
all right .
unh !
this is what i want .
everyone' s worried about your mother ... and what she wants .
but for me ... this is enough .
sitting down .
well , sounds crazy , doesn' t it ?
no , no , no .
but i swear , i think that' s it .
all my life working ... saving , building .
for what ?
all i ever wanted really was to ... sit down ... not worry about anything .
oh , boy , i get it .
believe me , i get it .
you know what ?
i think that' s all mom wanted , too .
only she wanted to sit next to you .
you' re a nice guy , you know that ?
ah , that' s the tequila talking .
no .
no , you' re a nice fella .
ahh .
thanks for being my baby boy .
i heard you with your girl .
i think you got it right .
i mean , a baby comes into the world .
where' s it gonna go ?
it could go anywhere , right ?
you could' ve gone to some parents in china ... or timbuktu , but you didn' t .
you came to us .
why ?
who the hell knows ?
but it worked out good .
well , thanks for being my daddy .
my pleasure .
well , i' il tell you ... all i ever really wanted ... really ...

benny ?
benny ?

i can do without it .
what ?
her doctors discovered it two weeks ago .
told her it was inoperable .
they said , " figure six months .
i don' t understand .
i mean , how can that be ?
she didn' t tell anyone .
she didn' t ... she didn' t ... she didn' t even tell the girls till she was at the hospital already .
she went out to the island ... and she found some nice little place on the water ... and she was ... she was by herself for a couple of days .
she was feeling fine .
and then she started ... she started blacking out .
oh , my god .
oh , my god .
so , when she wrote that note on the refrigerator ... she made that all up ?
no , she didn' t make it up .
she did want to be alone .
just for reasons ... nobody knew about .
how could this be ?
hello , my busy playboys .
heh !
hello .
all right .
all right .
look at you .
you don' t need to be so dramatic .
i' m not going anywhere yet .
and come here .
how are you ?
better than you .
what did the doctor say ?
oh , the doctor .
he said i' m an old lady ... and this is what happens to old ladies .
why wouldn' t you tell me ?
you think i tell you everything ?
you know , you think you' re gonna live forever ... but you don' t .
just live till one day , and then suddenly ... you' re done .
that' s their big forever .

hi , sweetheart .
how are you ?
sit down , darling .
so , how was the farm ?
what farm ?
they went to look at a house , a farmhouse on a lake .
nobody tells me anything .
so was it nice ?
i don' t want to talk about it .
hey , this place didn' t work out , but let me say this .
this guy is gonna find you a farm .
i promise you that .
i don' t want a farm .
what does that mean ?
we need to live in the country ?
yeah .
oh , you know that i' ve never wanted that .
don' t you ?
your mother wanted that .
not ... not me .
no , i know .
i know she ...
what are you saying ?
so ... you don' t want it ?
sorry .
wrong wife .
so when ... when we' re looking every sunday ... in the magazine section and you' re pointing ... and you' re pointing it out , what is that ?
well , it seemed so important to you .
how come you never mentioned this before ?
oh , i have .
you just haven' t listened .
ahem .
you know , benny showed me that letter .
what letter ?
this letter .
where did you get this ?
benny .
what happened ?
what did i do now ?
i always wondered where this went to .
this one took it .
i thought maybe i threw it in the garbage or something .
wait a minute .
wait a minute .
wait a minute .
you said a lot of things in this letter .
and i want you to know that ...
i didn' t know .
and now that you know ?
oh , now that i know ?
now that i know , i feel ...
i feel bad .
what do you think ?
i feel shitty .
listen , don' t believe everything you read .
what ?
what are you do ...
what ... what ... what ... what are you saying ?
what ?
what , you didn' t mean what you wrote in the letter ?
well ...
hmm ?
maybe ... then .
then .
then .
yeah .
how about now ?
how about all the years between then and now ?
benny .
what are you doing ?
wait .
wait a second .
wait a second .
people change .
you know .
no , that' s not true .
no , people don' t change .
they change their expectations .
they adjust .
what ?
have i felt disappointed ?
yes .
all right ?
do i wish some things had gone better ?
of course , yes , i wish some things had gone better .
so , who gets everything they want ?
ok .
all right .
what do you want me to say ?
say what you want to say .
what are you saving it for ?
come on , he' s a big boy .
hmm ?
why did you leave him ?
truth .
i left ... because i wanted to see if i could .
i wanted to ... to be not taken for granted .
plus ... you know why else ?
i know that when i' m gone ... heh ... you' re not gonna know what to do .
i don' t think you' re so good by yourself .
this way , you could practice ... see what it' s like , you know ?
heh .
and if you hated me for it ... that' s not so terrible .
you' d all get to talk about it together .
see , this is the thing about my mother .
she was made of love .
in the middle of all this ... she was taking care of everyone else .
under all that anger ... after all that disappointment ... the flame still flickered ... the love kept ticking .
and she still held on to hope .
despite everything she knew ... and even everything she said ... she chose to believe that things really might change .
and my father ...
god bless him ... to his credit and to everyone' s amazement ... he did manage to change .
he still had within him the ability to surprise .
ok , you can look .
i heard you never got to go .
it' s been closed for , like , sixty years ... so , you know ... a lot of the best exhibits aren' t up anymore .
on the other hand ... on the other hand , there' s no lines .
oh , almost forgot .
i got a little something for you .
what are you trying to do , kill me ?
so it took me fifty years to understand .
so ?
i' m not the swiftest guy in town .
but now i' m all caught up , what do you say we try again ?
round two .
we' il say round one was everything up till now ... and round two is from today on .
what do you think ?
sound like a plan to you ?
your loving husband , sam .
ok .
my mother made it through the summer .
that' s how long forever turned out to be .
but for that whole forever ... it was the happiest i ever saw them together .
my father moved in with us after that .
we had our grapefruit juice every morning ... and watched the news together every night .
it was a special , magical time .
but proving once again that you never know ... we woke up one morning , and my father didn' t .
he had been feeling perfectly fine .
i think he just really missed his gal .
it was a year full of surprises .
a few months later , we had another baby ... a boy .
we named him martin samuel , after both of them .
the little guy never got to know my mother and father ... but , as no love shall heretofore be wasted ...
i promise you , he' s gonna hear all about ' em .
