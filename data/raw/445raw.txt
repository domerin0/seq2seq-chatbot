keep your snacks in the kitchen .
bye , mom .
he' s really taken to you in the month you' ve been with us .
likewise .
too bad you can' t stay on when tony' s back .
it was just a favour .
i don' t usually do this sort of ajob .
i thought you were a professional driver .
a different kind of driving .
well , we' re all gonna miss you when you' re gone .
and ... thank you for what you did .
for what ?
for turning the car around so that jack wouldn' t have to see us fighting .
you really know kids , don' t you ?
i know fighting .
he hasn' t seen jack in months , and when he gets back , all i hear is what i' m doing wrong .
you' d think that after being separated for a year that he would ...
i' m sorry .
you don' t have to hear this .
it' s ok .
for what it' s won' th , i think you' re doing a greatjob with jack .
thank you .
any time i can be of help , if there' s anything you need .
that' s really sweet of you , frank .
i might have to take you up on it .
i almost forgot .
i' m supposed to take jack to the doctor tomorrow morning for a checkup , but i' m organising a party for him , even though his birthday' s not until next week .
so , while i decorate and his friends arrive , i was thinking , if you wouldn' t mind ...
i' il take him .
i feel funny cutting into your weekend .
i' m just picking up a friend at the airport later on in the day .
that' s nice .
what is ?
the guys on security say you' re a bit of a ioner .
um ...
so it' s just nice to hear you have a friend .
he' s not really a friend .
he' s french .
i' il call you back .
audrey .
i' d like to finish our conversation .
if anything comes up before then , you have my cell .
nothing will come up , mrs billings .
audrey .
audrey .
yeah , hello ?

9am .
tomorrow , 9am .

the drug enforcement ministers of six latin american countries arrived in miami for a summit meeting ...
yeah .
martin , frank .
1156 palmeadow .
i' m waiting for an express delivery .

i don' t need anything else .
just the pizza .
i' m not paying for that ...
hi .
hi .
so , it' s one medium pie , no mozzarella , extra olives and extra anchovies , which amounts to $11 . 95 .
i hope you' re hungry .
you have no idea .
i apologise for the delay , sir .
mrs billings .
audrey .
audrey .

what does it look like i' m doing ?

i think it' s what i needed the most .

i don' t know .
jeez .
we' re not open yet .
i need to see the doctor immediately .
right .
dr koblin , if you' il come out here , please .
we have an issue .
you' il have to state the medical problem .
actually , my problem' s not medical .
it' s psychological .
yes , laura .
what seems to be the problem ?
me .
i hate shots .
number one , there' s no guarantee you' re getting a shot .
there' s no sense getting worked up over something that might not happen .
give me the news .
doctor said i' m cured .
frank , it hurts a lot .
i' d never let anyone hurt you a lot .
promise ?
you know my fourth rule ?
never make a promise you can' t keep .
come on .
close the door .
come on .
may i help you ?
jack billings to see dr koblin .
he' s out sick today .
he' il be seeing dr tyberg .
i like dr koblin .
don' t worry .
dr tyberg' s very nice .
just take him into room 3 .
where' s laura ?

you' re standing at her desk .
that laura .
she' s out sick too .
there' s a lot of flu going around .
now , come on .
doctor' s got a busy day .
come on .
it' il be over before you know it .
hey , hey !
i' m dr tyberg .
can' t i wait for my doctor ?
your doctor was called away on an emergency .
the nurse said he had the flu .
that was the emergency .
he came down with flu , very quickly .
so , the sooner we start , the sooner we finish .
come .
i show you something very cool .
i' m sorry .
doctor patient privacy in room .
you can wait in reception area , or glass of water , or ...
hey , trust me .
i am doctor .

it' s phone .
yeah ?
all , all .
frank ?
i am here .
you' re early .
yeah , we had fantastic tailwinds .

from now on , it' s the only way i' m flying .
tailwinds or nothing .
glad you made it .
hello .
sorry , dr dunietz is not in today .
call back monday .
i' m a little tied up .
you mind taking a cab ?
you have the address , yes ?
oh , thank you .
i heard the fish down here is fantastic .
i could make us a bouillabaisse .
you like bouillabaisse , frank , no ?
i gotta go .
frank !
maybe we' il wait for his regular doctor .
it' s important that he receives immunisations .
i' m sure .
but a week won' t make a difference .
no , we' re doing it now .
get going , jack !
look at me .
look at me .
remember my promise ?
yes .
it' s ...
it' s me !
get out !
frank .
shit .
the patient' s not cooperating .
prep the vehicle .
come on , hurry .
don' t worry .
everything' s gonna be ok .
freeze !
put your guns on the ground !
get down !
si .
they got away .
cazzo !
plan b ?
yes .
plan b.
oh , you made it .
oh , what' s that ?
jack' s birthday present .
baseball uniform , cleats , glove and a bat .
it' s his favourite sport .
it was .
last year .
he' s on a soccer team now .
he' s good .
you know , you should see him sometime .
hello .
mr and mrs billings !
they' re coming !
hide , everyone .
hide !
yes .
good morning , mr driver .
who is this ?
look in your rear view mirror and you' il see .
i know what you' re thinking .
bulletproof glass .
so tell me , in your experience which judging from the performance you put on in the office goes way beyond driving children to school does bulletproof glass stop a 7 . 62 armour piercing round ?
frank , why have you stopped the car ?
don' t look , they are triangulated over 300 feet away .
frank , pick up .
you screwed up my plan .
i am going to tell you how to set things right .
someone is going to appear in a few seconds .
let her in .
driver .
good boy .
good boy .
hi .
leave it on .
personally , i hate kids .
i don' t know what your feelings are on the subject , but if you ever want to have any , make no moves but the moves i tell you to make .
you' re in her hands now .
they can be gentle hands , but they can be the hands from hell .
trust me on this one .
trust him on this one .
now , drive .
make a left .
i said left .
listen , we keep doing this your way , they' re gonna catch us .
do this my way , no one gets hurt .
where' s the fun in that ?
let' s save the fun for later .
hey !
not bad .
didrt your mother teach you to say thank you ?
she tried , and failed miserably .
i think we lost them .
think again .
thought complete .
let' s go .
you can' t find him ?
he' s one man in one car .
he' s a chauffeur , for chrissakes .
not exactly , sir .
there' s a possibility he was in on it .
that' s impossible .
how would you know ?
he could have been setting this up the whole time , and you wouldn' t have known .
and you are an expert on knowing people .
his background .
he' s ex special forces .
headed a commando unit .
specialised in search and destroy .
been in and out of lebanon , syria , sudan .
the man is a hunter .
i don' t care what his skills are or where he' s from .
this is not a war zone , this is an american city !
where' s my son ?
last stop .
all out .
you' re quite a guy .
another time , another place you and me , baby , the pleasure we could have .
beauty .
frank .
frank !
frank !
not what you expected when you reported for work this morning , is it , frank ?
no ?
is that what passes for wit in this circle ?
in this circle , my friend , wit is not a requirement of the job .
brutality , yes .
an ability to inflict pain , absolutely .
a certain psychotic , moral ignorance , blind obedience , all required .
but not wit .
how was it ?
fun .
only the beginning , my love .
what' s this all about ?
a timely question .
max .
pardon me .
hello .
put me on the speaker .
in the next two hours , you' il get five million dollars in $100 bills .
put them in a waterproof suitcase , go to the bayfront park personally .
there will be a blue chrysler parked there .
place the suitcase in the trunk , and leave .
i don' t know if i can get five million dollars in two hours .
i read the newspapers .
when you were appointed to your current position , your net won' th exceeded 100 million dollars , so you won' t even feel the bite .
what guarantee do i have that you won' t harm my son ?
guarantee " ?
mr billings , i am not a car dealer .
don' t let the charming accent and my impeccable syntax mislead you .
i live in the jungle , and in the jungle you either eat or be eaten .
but , in the spirit of business , here is the guarantee .
ten minutes past the deadline , if the money doesn' t arrive , i send a finger .
20 minutes , a hand .
30 minutes , a foot .
sounds like we have a deal .
you have a deal .
could we please speak to our son ?
mommy !
mommy !
you have two hours , mr billings .
starting now .
just get my son !
all right .
all right .
frank , you promised you wouldn' t let anybody hurt me !
you promised !
never make promises you can' t keep .
i don' t .
it' s one of my rules .
wow .
bravo .
a man who leads his life by rules .
in my world rules are meant to be broken .
not mine .
you' re gonna have to make an exception .
go .
prego .
go .
hey , driver !
no , no , wait , wait .
a little distance between us isn' t a bad thing .
andiamo !
now .
hold on .
the signal .
hello .
it' s me .
you son of a bitch .
look , i had nothing to do with this .
one scratch on his head ...
let me speak to who' s in charge .
this is us marshal stappleton .
act fast .
there are three boats .
tell us where you are .
get a plane .
they' re heading north .
tell me where you are .
just tell us where you are !
hello , frank ?
got it .
all .
tarconi , it' s me .
get out of the house .
i was just putting the madeleines ...
forget the madeleines , just get out .
and go where ?
anywhere .
go to the beach .
oh , the beach .
the famous miami beach .
oh , my dream .
i would love to go to the beach .
maybe not .
freeze !
who the fuck are you ?
i' m the cook .
oh .
this is a mistake .
a terrible mistake .
why we can' t all just get along , you know ?
hello .
it' s frank .
pretend it' s someone else .
hi , susan .
no , i' m just here at home .
i didn' t do it , audrey .
she had a gun on jack .
i had no choice .
yeah , i saw that .
what do you know ?
it' s more than a kidnapping .
they asked for a ransom .
the doctors , they were fake .
they were trying to give jack a shot .
when i interrupted them ...
i promised jack i wouldn' t let anyone hurt him .
i' m not gonna break that promise .
frank .
i' il call you back .
audrey .
is everything all right ?
that' s a pretty stupid question to ask , jeff .
all right .
so tell me again , inspector tarconi , why you didn' t immediately identify yourself as a police officer .
oh , i was overwhelmed by the effectiveness of your operation , the sophistication of your equipment .
you know , i work in a small office in a small town .
we only have small crimes .
i was a little insecure .
you and frank martin are friends , right ?
a friend ?
oh , i wouldn' t say exactly a friend .
i know him , we have a relationship .
a long relationship ?
not so long .
they found you cooking in his house .
i' m french !
so ?
we don' t need to know someone a long time in order to cook for them .
it' s an icebreaker .
take , for example , this sandwich and coffee you so graciously offer me .
well , pardon me to think so , but it' s not very good .
i know , but what has that got to do with anything ?
do you have a kitchen ?
stay back .
stay back .
don' t move .
smith !
drop it .
oh , jesus .
what happened ?
we' il take care of it for you .
is this safe ?
look over your shoulder .
we got you covered .
as my mother used to say , a meal is only limited by your imagination .
crme brle et croque monsieur .
cream brle ?
crme brle .
cock ?
croque monsieur .
croque monsieur .
oui ?
where are you ?
cooking .
cooking .
can you talk ?
oh , speak of the devil .
my mother .
mom .
please , do you mind ?
thank you .
oui , maman .
je suis trs bien arriv .
oui , trs trs bien , merci .
oui .
ah , oui , c' est une trs jolie ville .
may i ask who you' re cooking for ?
for the us marshals .
once they found my badge , they were very polite .
they gave me a coffee and a sandwich .
you wouldn' t believe what passes for food here .
i am correcting the situation while they wait for my chief to call and confirm everything .
of course , that might take a while .
he' s never there .
anything about me ?
they are very interested about you .
they want to know where you are .
where are you ?
nowhere for very long .
listen , hold on .
do you have access to a computer ?
easier than having access to something decent to eat .
oh , handsome fellow .
who is he ?
do they have an id program ?
forgive me .
i' m not so used to this system .
at home , there is one computer for ten of us .
so , how is it with you , frank ?
it' s a complicated story .
ah , you mean you are in the shit ?
you might say that .
in other words , your natural state .
voil .
a russian biologist with advanced degrees from the state laboratory .
do we have an address ?
miami , boca west , king street , number 11 .
get out !
hey !
what are you doing ?
trying to catch a bus .
come on .
what are you doing , driver ?
not so good on the water , hey ?
stop it !
stop it !
ok .
ok .
tell me about the doctor' s office .
what doctor' s office ?
where you tried to stick the kid with this .
you want to tell me ?
do you know what you have done ?
do you know what you have done ?
obviously something not conducive to your good health , which is all i needed to know .
have a good life ... what' s left of it .
outpost to base .
the ransom is still there .
thanks .
the ransom hasn' t been picked up .
don' t worry .
what if it' s notjust a kidnapping ?
i' ve worked on many kidnapping cases .
if they don' t take it i won' t get my son back .
don' t make this any more complicated than it is .
i' m not making this complicated , jefferson .
it' s because of yourjob .
what does my job have to do with this ?
it has everything to do with it .
because you became famous , we became the targets .
no matter what you think , the only one who' s out there trying to get jack back is frank .
the chauffeur ?
you spoke to frank martin ?
what the hell are you doing talking to him ?
he' s the last person who saw jack alive !
we' ve found the boy .
hard drive blew .
get another one in there .
yes , sir .
how long is it gonna take ?
ma' am , we' re going as fast as we can .
he can suffocate in there .
stay calm .
it' s my son !
let them work .
are you gonna sit and do nothing ?
they' re experts .
everyone is an expert !
i' ve had it with all of you !
audrey !
audrey !
audrey !
audrey !
mommy !
jack !
are you ok ?
there you go , little buddy .
breathe .
come on , breathe .
you' re the devil .
i wish .
shit !
dimitri , you scare shit in me .
where is sonovitch ?
in chamber .
i need to speak with him .
sit down !
listen panasonic .
is rap music , is good .
what was that ?
i don' t know .
shit !
what are you doing ?
i need antidote .
the driver , he inject me with virus .
look !
dimitri , where would he get the virus ?
the one we left in doctor' s surgery .
please , i need antidote .
i am sick .
calm down .
you' re not sick .
you have four hours before the virus is active .
you know that .
you worked on creating it .
open fridge .
i' m telling you ...
izvinite .
open fridge .
open the fridge !
yes .
insurance policy .
how many you have ?
two doses .
enough for tipov and myself .
tipov' s policy cancelled .
there is one for me .
and i want it now .
come on .
come on .
let' s do it !
let' s not .
who are you ?
there is enough for two .
you don' t need it .
but you injected me .
with water .
i' m not sick .
you' re not sick .
water .
water .
son of bitch !
good .
our problem is solved .
one dose for each of us .
it' s not for us .
one for you and one for the child .
touching .
my patience is about to run out .
tell me about the virus .
ok .
what do you want know ?
everything .
what is it ?
a recombinant retroimmune double polymorphing effluent .
the child will die .
anyone he breathes on will die , and then it' s over .
what do you mean , " it' s over ?
the virus goes inert after 24 hours .
thanks for the lesson .
now give me the vials .
you really want to play superhero , don' t you ?
well , let' s see if you can fly .
you ok ?
i' m ok .
there' s nothing to worry about .
it' s just a simple viral infection combined with stress .
it should pass in a day or two .
i gave him something to help him sleep .
call me if anything arises .
thank you , doctor .
you know , audrey , all this has ... well , it' s made me realise what a fool i' ve been .
with jack ... and with you .
are you ok ?
mr billings .
we' re running late .
i' il be right out .
i' d like to come by after the conference , check on jack .
check on you .
good .
i' il see you soon .
they' re here if you need them .
are you all right , ma' am ?
i' m fine .
hello .
it' s me .
are you ok ?
go to your bedroom .
hi , susan .
how are you ?
i' m alone .
where are you , frank ?
turn around .
frank , you were wrong .
it was a kidnapping .
jack is fine .
jack' s been infected with a virus .
anyone who comes into contact with him will die .
what are you telling me ?
are you telling me my son is gonna die ?
no , he' s not .
once incubated , the virus becomes airborne , so anyone he breathes on gets infected .
your son was a weapon .
the target is his father .
jefferson ?
well , why ?
the conference .
it' s the only logical answer .
every drug enforcement agency in one room .
your husband breathes , the room dies .
you gotta trust me , audrey .
can you get to him ?
what are you gonna do ?
find the guy responsible .
he has more of this .
for you and everybody else .
for you now .
we have a guest .
you' re burning up .
i' m ok .
you gotta go .
go .
don' t move !
is the governor here ?
everybody' s here .
delegates from all over the world .
just a second .
hello .
jefferson , you can' t go to the conference .
is everything all right ? ... to give him a deadly virus ...
i can' t hear you .
i' m inside .
i' ve got it , and so do you .
i can' t hear you .
their plan is to infect everyone there .
i' m gonna have to call you back .
jeff !
mr billings , are you all right ?
i' m all right .
come on , let' s go .
you sure ?
all .
you still a guest of the government ?
they gave me the five star accommodation .
let me guess you need my help .
are you near the computer ?
it' s practically my pillow .
so , how do you want to start ?
i don' t know .
i have nothing .
ah .
my favourite type of investigation .
let' s see .
alors .
i' d like to take this opportunity to introduce you to ...
breathe .
that' s right , breathe , my friend , breathe .
once these bastards are out of the way and their agreements are dead and buried , you know what the biggest problem will be ?
what ?
counting the money .
i can' t wait .
ay ay ay !
aah .
gianni chellini .
hires himself out to anyone looking to make trouble red brigade , shining path .
someone accessed a database on the 15th floor .
that' s gonzalez .
he' s on vacation .
was behind the hostage taking of the opec ministers in geneva .
it was a nice piece of work .
give me an address .
miami , east highland ,
pelican drive , number 26900 .
we' ve found the car .
you' re one great cop , tarconi .
thank you for the compliment .
now i' m going back to sleep .
hm .
maybe not .
bumbaclaat , man !
move out the way !
move over .
i' il do ya !
mommy .
honey .
you feeling better ?
a little bit .
why don' t you try to go back to sleep , ok ?
ma' am , are you all right ?
jefferson .
jefferson , are you ok ?
ok , do it .
what are you doing ?
you know , last night got me thinking .
how do we transport the antidote safely ?
we need something that won' t break or can' t be stolen .
something totally secure .
me .
impressive .
get dressed .
stop him .
these your friends ?
not yet .
where' d they go ?
the garage .
i' m out of ammo .
me too .
so am i.
where are the reloads ?
the garage .
check the house .
go , go , go !
get him !
get him !
what d' you want me to do ?
keep the meter running .
bye .
don' t worry , baby .
you' re safe now .
you' re safe .
you' re so beautiful .
remind me of my yellow poom poom rider .
don' t move .
oh , mr driver .
i' il blow you into tomorrow .
i' il bleed what you came for all over the floor .
you wouldn' t want this .
not after you worked so hard trying to get to the antidote .
take a good look , frank martin .
i' m a cure for what ails you .
i' m the only cure for what ails you .
i am the antidote .
nice try .
i' m impressed .
i didn' t give you enough credit .
it took more than a driver to figure this out .
i haven' t figured it all out yet .
perhaps i can help you .
what part are you a little thick on ?
you .
why ?
oh .
that' s the easy part .
it' s a business deal , pure and simple .
i' m for hire to the highest bidder .
in this case , the highest bidder was the colombian cocaine can' tels that wanted these pesky lawmen off their backs .
you think killing politicians will make things easier for them ?
that' s not my problem .
i was hired to do ajob .
i did the job , like you .
just my pay is better .
my hair and my suit , too .
oh , lola .
now , if you' il excuse me , i have a plane to catch .
kill him .
ciao .
don' t even blink .
what' s in this for you ?
pleasure ... in killing you .
we' re coming live from the key biscayne causeway where at least ten police cars are in hot pursuit of a stolen red pick up truck .
oh , my .
