people always talk about fate .
destiny .
i never used to believe in that .
some things are just out of your control .
like my parents .
they died when i was 1 8 .
there was nothing i could do about that .
but was that fate ?
then you would have to say everything was fate .
who you spend your life with .
what you end up doing for a living .
is what happens prepackaged and served to me by a higher power ?
i didn' t think so , but there has to be some explanation .
because my life was totally different a couple weeks ago .
i went to the bank today .
yeah ?
have you checked our balance lately ?
no .
wait .
did we ?
did we do it ?
we did it !
we have exactly $30, 006 .
we can get married !
yes .
i know you thought it was silly to wait until we had this money ... ... before we got married , but now we can put a payment on a house ... ... we can plan a family ...
elaine was incredible .
i' m so happy .
not here .
you can kiss me at home .
although she did have one odd habit .
she cried when we made love .
very loud crying , which made it kind of tough to concentrate .
are you okay ?
bye , sweetie .
bye .
she ran a gift basket business .
it was about to turn the corner .
and i was the assistant manager at homespital ... ... a store that sold medical supplies for the home .
i know it' s a lot of money , sir , but it' s a lot of chair .
john ?
in my office .
excuse me .
if there was one problem , it was that i worked for elaine' s father , mr. warner .
there always seemed to be an unspoken tension between us .
john boy !
come on in .
sit down .
my little girl told me the big news .
well , i' m glad , john .
i' m really glad .
yes , sir !
he wasn' t glad .
he hated me .
i think he even trained his dog , rex , to hate me too .
you' re an honorable kid .
you don' t see that these days .
i appreciate that you have been true to your word to me ... ... and that you have not slept with my daughter .
have you slept with her , john ?
no , sir .
okay , all right .
i' il tell you what .
i' m gonna give you a few seconds of immunity .
if you' ve slept with her , tell me here , tell me now , and we' il let it go .
have you slept with my daughter ?
mr. warner , i have never slept with elaine .
good !
goddamn it , that' s good .
if you had , i was gonna kick your balls into your head ... ... and let them rattle in your skull like dice in a cup .
have a good one .
to be completely honest , he sort of gave me the creeps .
he had a slightly weird relationship with his daughter .
but aside from that and my job ... ... life was pretty good .
hi .
hi .
john , look at this biscuit basket .
think the biscotti makes it look busy ?
no , it looks great .
yeah ?
yeah .
it does look good .
i' m proud of this basket .
you should be .
it' s good work .
thank you .
we should head to my sister' s soon .
oh , yeah .
i' m not going .
elaine never liked my sister , patty .
maybe it' s because patty was a free spirit .
i say free spirit because i' m uncomfortable calling her ... ... sexually indiscriminate trailer trash .
hey , patty !
where' s elaine ?
headache .
poor thing .
probably from being such a bitch 2 4l7 .
you know , she really likes you .
and i' m growing a dick , how about that ?
elaine wanted me to give you this gift basket .
god !
fantastic !
because this one was starting to reek .
thanks .
i hope you didn' t clean on my account .
hey , you know what ?
it has been crazy around here , all right ?
both of the cats ran away .
both of them .
two cats , mla .
what would make them do that ?
self respect ?
hi , uncle john !
hey !
noreen' s my niece .
we' re not sure who her dad is ... ... so i spent as much time with her as i could .
happy halloween !
hi !
what are you ?
i' m the statue of liberty .
you could say i' m the closest thing she has to a father figure .
good luck !
thanks , uncle john !
come on !
these carcasses don' t move themselves .
and i' m proud to say , she turned out to be a great kid .
genuine , hard working ... ... and in spite of everything that had happened around her , normal .
hi .
why are we watching these ?
we' re celebrating .
noreen has news .
please tell me you' re not pregnant .
uncle john !
here we go !
remember this ?
hi .
sorry i' m late .
traffic .
has the spelling bee started yet ?
she' s already out .
got her on the first word .
it was rigged .
i' m writing a letter !
noreen .
i' m sorry .
what was the word she misspelled ?
tarp .
tarp ?
yeah .
t a r p ?
great .
where were you five minutes ago ?
i' m stupid .
no , you' re not .
you' re smart .
yes .
you' il do great in school ... ... you' re gonna go to college , you' re gonna be brilliant .
well , uncle john , you were half right .
i don' t know if i' m brilliant , but guess who got into harvard ?
i can' t believe it !
what ?
i got accepted to harvard university !
you' re kidding !
that' s what this is about ?
that' s incredible !
i know !
my little goddamned genius !
see ?
what did i tell you ?
you work hard and follow your dreams , and things will always work out .
you were right .
bet you' re sorry you promised .
what promise ?
wait !
here it comes .
my favorite part .
i' m never gonna go into college now .
yes , you will .
i guarantee it .
i believe in you so much , know what i' m gonna do ?
what ?
i' m paying for it .
you get into college , and i' il pay for it .
and that' s a promise from your uncle john .
i' il be right back .
idiot !
idiot !
idiot !
idiot !
you know , noreen , a lot of kids are just taking a year off these days .
ever think about that ?
traveling ?
seeing asia ?
lot of people there .
must be something to it .
do you not want me to go to harvard ?
what ?
no !
i just think there' s value to being on the road with nothing but $100 .
hell , i' il give you $100 .
if it' s about money , don' t worry .
i' ve saved almost everything i' ve ever earned for this .
plus , i get financial aid , so it' s all pretty much paid for ... ... except one little chunk .
good !
how much more money do you need ? $29, 879 .
that' s the small chunk ?
it' s expensive .
found one .
and we need the money by the 1 5th .
yeah .
there' s our mr. biscuits .
i have to go .
yeah , he just walked in .
i didn' t know how to do it , but i had to tell elaine our house fund ... ... had just become noreen' s college fund .
so how was patty' s ?
really nice .
you know , noreen' s a great kid .
yeah .
so much raw potential .
boy , with the right opportunities ...
so i found this great house today .
what do you think ?
it' s great .
it' s a charming starter house on a spectacular tree lined street ... ... and it has hardwood cabinets .
and i love it .
if you go by and like it too , then maybe we could ...
don' t you think we' re moving fast here ?
john .
i know it seems scary to be spending all this money on a house ... ... but that' s what we' ve been saving for .
my mom and dad fought about money , but that can' t happen to us ... ... because we have $30, 000 ... ... for our house .
our home .
our future .
and no one can take that away from us .
that' s what i meant .
so noreen got into college , and elaine had found our dream house .
these wonderful things were locked in a struggle for the same money .
not $30, 000 .
i had to try and borrow it .
hello , dear .
no !
no !
who do you think i am ?
albert fucking trump ?
it was my last option .
a man whose ideas were sometimes so dumb ... ... they were brilliant .
i had to go to duff .
hey , man , how you been ?
john .
been almost two months .
did you disappear off the face of the earth ?
i' ve just been busy .
i' ve been busy ... ... with my landscaping company , landscape escape .
doesn' t mean i have to go and disappear off the face of the earth .
i can' t stay mad at you , man .
duff !
you burned me .
john !
john !
tarp ?
yep .
like a tarpaulin ?
no , just tarp .
who can' t spell tarp , duff ?
duff ?
don' t you think you' re taking a little too much off the top ?
i know what i' m doing .
i have to taper it so light reaches the lower leaves during growing season .
but what about this string ?
this string is a guide , john .
it' s just a guide .
i don' t know what i' m gonna do .
know what your problem is ?
you don' t understand an oath is an oath .
you made an oath to your niece .
no , i didn' t .
it was just an offhand remark .
how much money you got ?
30, 000 .
but that' s for buying elaine a house .
right .
look , i' m your friend .
i feel like i can talk straight with you .
elaine , i like her .
i like her a lot , john .
but she' s a bitch !
she' s a dirty , dumb bitch !
duff !
come on .
there are more productive things to do with money besides buying a house .
such as ?
such as ... ... putting it in a bag and throwing it off a cliff .
and that' s just coming off the top of my head .
i do know how you can get the money .
how ?
you take $1000 , you go to the horse racetrack ... ... you put it on a 30 to 1 .
what' s wrong with you ?
john , it' s been done , man .
kevin darnell , remember him ?
he put money down , won , and bought a used delorean .
he crashed it and died , but he did get money .
it can happen .
i was hoping for something just this side of theoretically possible .
you know any criminals ?
because , you know , criminals have lots of money .
how about david loach ?
david loach from high school ?
that guy' s a psycho .
you know what your problem is ?
you' re mentally inflexible .
duff , i hate to ask , but ...
john , i' m not rich , you know .
i may look it because of my expensive tools and my wonderful truck .
i' m like bill gates .
he may be the richest , but he doesn' t have money .
it' s all tied up in stocks .
i' m not liquid , john .
i' m not liquid .
what does that mean ?
it means i don' t have any money for you , man .
duff couldn' t give me money , but he could certainly give me advice .
know what your problem is ?
you don' t take responsibility seriously .
maybe you should have thought before you went and became an uncle !
i' m doing my best , duff .
i know she' s overcome a lot to turn out normal .
there haven' t been many people who helped her .
yeah .
but you know what ?
i' m gonna be one of them .
if i don' t come through for her now ... ... it' s possible she could lose faith or whatever she' s got that' s working .
i' m getting that money , duff .
even if i have to go to david loach .
you' re not gonna have to go to david loach .
i' ve got another idea .
can you get the beer ?
hey , kids .
duff' s dial a bottle .
time to party .
it' il be 20 each .
i thought it was 1 5 .
that' s what the flyer says .
but the fine print says " prices subject to change . " read the flyer .
you happy ?
you scum !
give me the money .
i' m not making money .
do i look rich ?
i barely break even .
go !
you skunks !
you pukes !
read the fine print .
that is the most irresponsible thing i' ve ever seen you do .
look , i provide a public service , john .
one way or another , they were gonna get drunk .
maybe they would have drank mouthwash or sniffed glue ... ... but , you know , they wanted beer .
those are good , honest kids .
they deliver newspapers , return old pop bottles all week ...
they deserve to unwind and get drunk .
it' s all part of the american dream .
your american dream just gave you the finger .
it' s their freedom .
jesus , duff !
here are your briefs , walter .
hi , john .
hi , mrs. duffy .
how are your folks , john ?
dead .
still .
i forgot .
i' m so sorry .
i' m on medication and it makes me loopy .
mom !
say hi to your folks , john .
you have to forgive her .
she' s been going through empty nest syndrome since i moved out .
moved out ?
you' re 20 feet from the house .
yeah .
and i love the freedom .
i could keep these beauties on as late as i want .
great .
john ...
i have a client .
lives over in the pembroke hills estates area .
guy' s loaded .
last week , i was just finishing up a job ...
but i thought i' d do one last round of the property .
you know , details ?
inspection is important to me .
thought i' d check out the whole interior .
although i' m an exterior landscaper , john , i also do interior work .
i was hungry , so i thought i' d heat up a brick of cheese .
i need my cheese !
but , john , i heard something upstairs ... ... and i thought , " i should check this out .
so i went to look around and i saw this painting on the wall ... ... and something didn' t seem right about it .
and i touched it , and it moved .
and behind the painting , there was this safe .
but i heard someone coming , so i gracefully slipped out .
but the best part , john , is the safe ... ... it wasn' t even locked .
nope .
you turn this corner , and it' s the whole slippery slope .
your whole moral code goes out the window .
no way .
look .
is it moral to let some fat , greasy man roll around naked ... ... in a pile of cash when it could be used for something good ... ... like sending noreen to college ?
we can' t .
the guy' s never home sunday nights .
sunday we go there , slip through the window ... ... which i accidentally left unlocked today .
and we grab the money .
the guy won' t miss the money ?
heard of insurance ?
heard of insurance ?
it' s called insurance .
he' s not gonna miss the money .
he' s not gonna pay .
the insurance guys are gonna have to pay .
and they deserve to pay !
bastards .
bastards .
where are you going ?
why are you here ?
i live here .
i thought you were going to a movie .
that was last night .
we' re supposed look at that house .
i can' t .
i' ve gotta go out .
why are you all dressed in black ?
are you going to rob a bank ?
no , baby .
i' m johnny cash .
hello .
but i' il look at the house on the way home .
okay ?
soon as i' m done robbing that bank .
have a good time .
okay .
ready ?
yeah .
let' s go .
sorry .
all right .
here we go .
let' s go .
let' s go , let' s go .
under the fence .
wait .
go .
go .
go .
what are you doing ?
it' s open .
john .
see those dead bushes ?
i planted those .
that' s the window there .
who should go first ?
i' m not going in .
what ?
someone has to watch in case he comes home .
you said he would be out .
he will be .
then why do we need a lookout ?
we don' t .
just go in .
you go in .
i don' t need money .
why risk it ?
what risk ?
there is no risk .
just go !
crap !
john .
hello ?
john !
good luck , buddy .
well , well .
what have we here ?
please don' t shoot me .
i' m not going to shoot you .
are you gonna call the police ?
no .
what are you gonna do ?
my wife died several years ago , and it' s ...
it' s really nice to have someone around .
now what ?
now we' re going to spoon .
spoon ?
you remember when we went to nova scotia that spring ... ... and we had those sand dabs at that restaurant on the bay ?
yes .
weren' t they tasty ?
yes .
i don' t think we' ve ever had sand dabs that tasty again .
remember the boat ride over ?
yes .
we drove .
oh , yeah .
happy times .
turn .
the petting zoo ...
all right .
now we do the photo shoot .
oh , my god .
it won' t do you any good to tell anyone .
i' m a respected member of the community .
no one will believe you .
a mint ?
i' m not gay .
i miss her very much ... ... and i haven' t been able to properly grieve and let go .
do you understand ?
yeah .
catch you around here again , i' il kill you !
that was enough .
i had to tell elaine that noreen needed our money .
and no matter how unpleasant that would be ... ... it couldn' t hold a candle to the fetish i just endured .
hi .
hi .
i' m gonna go take a shower .
wait .
don' t you think you should tell me what happened at that house ?
what ?
you said you were gonna look at that house .
that house .
yeah , i looked at it .
it was great .
great .
oh , god .
i am so glad you liked it .
because i did something bad .
i can' t even believe i did this , but i put in an offer .
what do you mean ?
i know .
it seems so impulsive .
but i just love the house so much , and you do too , so ...
what about the $30, 000 ?
it' s gone !
all of it .
in escrow .
and we find out tomorrow if they accept the offer .
isn' t it exciting ?
everything is working out exactly like we planned .
aren' t you thrilled ?
yeah .
you don' t look thrilled .
i' m in happy shock .
duff !
you left me there .
you said he wasn' t home sunday nights .
i tried to warn you .
what happened ?
nothing .
absolutely nothing happened at all .
if nothing happened , why are you so angry ?
elaine put in an offer on this house .
if they accept , our money' s locked up .
sorry , noreen .
hope you like working at dairy queen .
mr. warner wants to see you in his office .
thanks , loretta .
i' m calling regarding the property on hyden street .
i' d like to put in an offer .
you have an offer already now , do you ?
well , perhaps i could throw my hat into the ring .
john .
come on in .
so , john boy ...
what did you and my little girl do last night ?
hung out , watched television .
really ?
that' s funny .
i was visiting a friend near pembroke heights last night ... ... 9 : 30 , 9 : 45 , and i thought i saw you ... ... run out of somebody' s house like a bat out of hell .
i saw you , john .
rex saw you .
no .
no , john ?
odd .
it looked just like you , and guess what ?
he got into a car looked just like your car .
interesting .
you wouldn' t lie to me .
so i guess my eyes were playing tricks on me .
i' il just have to watch what' s going on more carefully , won' t i ?
you won' t have to watch ...
watch what ?
i won' t have to watch what ?
go ahead , say it .
i should ...
say it !
confess !
i really need to get back to work .
we know .
we know , don' t we , rex ?
okay .
i see what' s going on here .
you think you' re mr. real estate .
that' s great .
do you have any kids ?
good .
three of them ?
well , that' s even better .
because i want an audience when i come over , take you out ... ... and beat the living bejesus out of you !
i was putting an offer on your house .
great .
how' d that go ?
he' s mulling it over .
we got the house !
i was worried about the other offer , but it fell through .
it must be fate !
i' m so happy !
should we stop ?
why do you always do that ?
we get a nice mood going , and then you ruin it .
i think you have some intimacy problems , john .
i really do .
what is that ?
john !
john , come here !
is that duff ?
yeah , i guess it is .
you can' t ring the doorbell ?
i didn' t wanna wake up elaine .
that' s why you were revving your engine ?
okay , well , i guess someone doesn' t want $30, 000 .
from where ?
i asked my uncle .
are you serious ?
i don' t know what to say .
don' t worry about it .
hop in .
we gotta meet him in 1 5 minutes .
i see .
what is he doing here ?
evening , ma' am .
you wanna shut off m' lady ?
you wanna shut it off for me ?
maybe you' d like to shut it off for me !
just , please .
just sit tight a second .
okay ?
i thought you weren' t hanging out anymore .
duff' s grown up an awful lot .
he' s still an asshole .
casserole .
i said asshole .
i thought you said casserole .
i said asshole .
i heard casserole .
i bumped into duff , and when he heard about the new house ... ... he was so thrilled , he offered to do some free landscaping .
what are you ... ?
don' t wait up , okay ?
we may have to do soil tests ...
got soil testing ...
you' re ...
check the roots ...
checking the roots .
don' t ...
irrigation .
what are ... ?
you' re waking everybody up !
you come here a lot , jack ?
i don' t think that' s any of your goddamn business .
sorry .
so here' s the deal .
the state lottery jackpot' s up to $86 million this week .
i don' t think the lottery' s gonna help .
shut up before i show this shoe your anal cavity .
i don' t like this guy .
i got a feeling .
he just wants to know what' s going on , okay , uncle jack ?
not here .
my uncle owns one of the biggest liquor stores in the state .
he' s a very successful man .
that' s because i found an opportunity and exploited it .
that opportunity being alcoholics .
and after all these years of work , i wind up being a pimp for the state .
the lottery .
the lottery .
i have one of the biggest lottery outlets in the state .
tomorrow alone we' il take in over $70, 000 .
you know what i get for that ?
pennies ?
it' s an insult .
so tell him the plan .
not here .
i got so much lottery money , i can' t fit it in the cash register .
i dump it into a cardboard box under the ticket terminal .
can you imagine how easy it would be to steal that money ?
wouldn' t that be bad ?
that would be bad , hamster dick ... ... unless i knew who was robbing me , and we had a deal worked out .
it' s foolproof .
we stick the place up , we grab the money and we' re done .
and you' re gonna be there .
no , i' m going to be in reno ... ... so nobody smells anything .
the kid behind the counter weighs like 8 pounds .
is he gonna piss when he sees what a big gun you have ?
gun ?
no .
no way .
we' re not gonna use real guns , john .
we' re not gonna use real guns .
just bring me the cash ... ... i' il give you 30, 000 for your trouble .
you in or out ?
can i think about it ?
while i think about cutting off ... ... your sack with a dull penknife .
where did you get him ?
what are you doing , man ?
excuse me .
is this 1 00 % cotton ?
i want something that will breathe .
nice .
we' re going skiing .
none of these guns look real .
this one is green .
this one turns into a robot .
don' t they have any that look like real guns ?
maybe we should use slingshots .
a slingshot is not a real weapon .
it' s a toy .
it' s not a real weapon , is it , john ?
define the word weapon for me ... ... while this baby smashes into your temple at 1 80 miles per hour .
hello ?
hi .
can i help you ?
we' re looking for a gun ... ... that looks like a real gun .
metal , possibly with some bolt action .
we don' t sell realistic weapons , sir .
our store' s policy is to make children' s gunplay nonviolent .
do you sell spray paint ?
can i help you guys ?
no , no .
we' re cool .
look , john ... ... we got mr. tough guy here .
are you ready ?
no ?
how about now , you bastards ?
you want a slice of this ?
how would you like a whole plateful of this , you stupid bastards ?
what ?
you boys look nice .
are you going to the dance ?
mom ... ... get out of here !
you nervous ?
i guess .
you got your gun ?
yeah , but the paint is a little sticky .
it looks good , though .
thanks .
let' s do this .
yeah .
john , wait .
what ?
we should make up some names .
why ?
just in case we have to communicate inside .
i wanna be kyle .
i knew this guy , his name was kyle .
he was maybe 1 3 .
he got two girls pregnant .
two girls pregnant .
yeah , kyle .
who you gonna be ?
steve .
steve .
yeah .
okay , steve .
okay , kyle .
wait .
what ?
wait , i wanna be steve .
i' m steve .
you' re carl .
kyle !
i just wanna go in there and do this !
kyle !
excuse me .
all right , american cattle !
nobody does anything stupid and you go home to your tv dinners .
put your hands in the air , sweetheart .
shit .
get them up .
give us the money .
it' s underneath .
i' il get it .
if he tries to be a hero , you pop him , kyle .
i hear you , kyle .
i' m steve .
i' m steve .
he' s kyle !
give us the money !
keep the hands up , schoolboy !
here .
yeah , come to steve .
all right , get on the floor and count to 300 .
no skipping numbers or counting in base 8 or anything like that .
one .
two ...
look at this gun .
this one' s better .
not now .
let' s go !
i don' t think so , punk ass !
freeze !
you move , i pop you like a pimple .
now put the box down .
now drop the guns .
drop it !
i' m trying .
the paint , it' s stuck .
fucking get with it , john .
steve .
my name is steve !
drop it !
go !
go !
go !
we almost died .
i' ve never been shot at before .
there was one other time , but i didn' t know till after .
i told you it was a bad idea .
i told you !
know your problem ?
get out !
you can' t thank people for trying to help .
help me get my ass shot off ?
i give up .
i failed noreen , and i don' t care .
i wanna get back to my life .
i' ve been thinking of this scam that involves pizza delivery .
you were never steve !
one of these guys was about 6 foot .
what about the other guy ?
the same , only heavier .
and you said his name was ... ?
john or kyle ... ... or steve .
and the other guy' s name was ... ?
kyle or john or steve .
do you have a permit ?
yes , sir .
how many times did you fire it ?
just once .
i shot out the window .
i didn' t shoot out the sign .
they did that .
they shot the sign , not me .
and then they doubled back and stole the surveillance tapes .
they were crazy .
they were crazy .
they were crazy .
anything else you' d like to tell me right now ?
i don' t know if this would help ... ... i remember four digits on the license plate .
no .
i don' t think that would help at all .
what are you , a complete numskull ?
give me the numbers .
yeah , i can' t believe i got in !
patty ?
who is it ?
it' s john .
hold on !
how' s it going ?
hi .
the doorbell gave out this morning , and they couldn' t fix it .
a little late for an electrician .
i don' t like your tone .
you got something to say , why don' t you say it ?
hey .
i know i' ve always been too wild for your tastes ... ... but what can i tell you ?
i' ve got an independent spirit .
and a thing for the electricians local 2 1 4 .
why are you so mean ?
give me a break .
patty , i' m sorry !
i' m having a really rough time right now .
i' m having trouble getting it together .
john ...
do you remember mom and dad' s funeral ?
and that suit you wore ?
the brown one .
you couldn' t tie your tie , and you asked me to do it , but i couldn' t .
it was no big deal .
the priest did it .
but that is a big deal , john .
because i' m your older sister , and i couldn' t even tie your goddamn tie .
i mean , look , i know i' m not gonna win the best sister prize ... ... but ...
god , john ... ... what you are doing for noreen ... ... is so generous and so good .
it' s nice to know after all this time ... ... i have a little brother who maybe sort of loves me .
you know i love you .
you' re my family .
uncle john !
what a surprise !
this is my uncle .
if it wasn' t for him , none of this would be possible .
pull the vehicle forward .
a little more .
a little more .
ricky , swing to the branch .
swing your body .
pretend you' re a little monkey , but you have a saw ... ... and you' re pruning .
you' re a monkey .
good .
yeah , no ...
on the branch .
prune , ricky , prune .
swing it , swing on the branch .
on the branch , ricky !
hey , how did she take the news ?
did she start to cry ?
did she shake ?
she didn' t wobble ?
i didn' t tell her , duff , and i' m not going to .
noreen is going to harvard .
because i am going to see loach .
are you sure ?
yeah .
and you' re coming with me .
right now .
okay , that' s an act of god .
hang in there , ricky .
yes , i understand it was a funeral .
i guess i goofed up .
i can see how a happy happy birthday basket ... ... might seem ironic and cruel , but it was an honest mistake .
it' s not that easy running a small sized business out of a house ... ... especially this house !
i' m sorry he' s dead , but things haven' t been great around here either .
can i put you on hold ?
hello .
daddy ?
is it okay if i come over ?
what do you want ?
hey , is loach here ?
lift high and lower .
point the toes .
flatten abdominals .
hey , guys .
we' re old friends of dave' s .
we went to school with him .
yeah , school .
i' m sure you' ve heard of school .
you probably went there for a couple of days while you were little .
i' m just kidding .
trying to break the ice .
why is anybody talking ?
hey , dave .
john plummer .
remember ?
you used to call me asshole ?
i call everybody asshole .
i believe i was the first .
we were 5 , maybe 6 , at the time .
congratulations , asshole .
now get to the point .
i might need a partner for some heavy stuff .
how heavy ?
well , let' s just say it' s a little too heavy to lift alone .
okay , so talk .
not here .
okay , just so we' re all on the same page , i' m flying right now .
angel dust .
so let' s keep it real , boys .
keep it real , and nobody is getting hurt .
i could smell your foot .
i could smell your foot on that one .
he' s been acting strange .
he' s been out three nights .
the first night he came home , he went and took a shower .
that' s not good .
he' s having an affair , isn' t he ?
now , sweetheart , let' s not rush to judgment .
but yes .
your shitty boyfriend is having an affair ... ... and we might have some information about that .
tell me .
tell me .
no .
i don' t want to upset you until it' s absolutely certain ... ... that i can upset you .
let me do some snooping ... ... and then we' il respond swiftly and without mercy .
what happened ?
did he give you the money ?
he said he' d get it for me tomorrow , duff .
it couldn' t have been easier .
i don' t know how this is gonna go down , sweetheart .
things could get a little crazy .
i don' t want you getting hurt .
kitten , i gave the vc 1 8 months to hurt me , and i walked away laughing .
don' t worry about me .
i' m coming .
no , you' re not .
this doesn' t concern you .
doesn' t concern me ?
it' s my life .
you made a heck of a job out of it .
this guy is a lump .
i don' t want you wasting more time .
who is gonna support you ?
i can support myself .
once my basket business turns the corner , i ...
putting bows on faggy little olives and water biscuits is not a job .
it' s a nice hobby , but it will never pay the bills .
it' s always money with you .
sometimes i think you care more about money than you do me .
kitten , honey , innocent ...
i don' t want you getting all emotional about this .
yeah .
hello ?
is anyone home ?
hello ?
well , well .
what have we here ?
what kind of car did we have when we first got married ?
i think it was an el dorado .
yes .
it was an el dorado , wasn' t it ?
turn .
i' m not a homosexual , you understand .
i just ...
i miss my wife very much .
i lost my wife three years ago .
you know what i' m going through .
well , not to this extent , per se , but i have a rough idea .
you can go ahead and put your clothes on .
can i have some privacy ?
i feel funny getting dressed around other men .
what the hell ?
i' m here investigating a holdup of a liquor store ... ... that occurred a short time ago on fourth street .
i don' t know anything about that .
that' s odd .
here' s why .
the license plate on your car matches the license plate of the car ... ... used during the robbery .
that' s not possible .
it was with me the whole night .
where were you ?
with ...
my friend .
having a couple beers .
where ?
i just don' t really remember , because i was , you know , a little messed up .
you drove drunk ?
i' m sorry ?
you were in the car and you were drunk , so you drove drunk .
not that i can recall .
what was your friend' s name ?
walter duffy .
duff .
and this duff will say that you were with him at the time of the robbery ?
yeah , he will .
very much so .
yeah .
you seem a little shaky , plummer .
yeah .
the booze .
it' s a bad scene .
it sure as hell is .
you told him you were with me .
gave my name .
you want me to lie to a cop ?
yes !
yes , i do !
where is loach ?
he' il be here .
he told us to park in this lot at 3 : 00 and to wait until he showed up .
well , it' s 1 0 after .
he' s not gonna show .
yes , he will .
this is a plan that , unlike your plans , will succeed .
and do you know why ?
because i did a little creative visualization ... ... and i saw it succeeding in my mind' s eye .
everybody , hands in the air !
money in the bag !
facedown !
money in the bag !
i' il shoot you in the ass !
he' s not gonna show .
yes , he will .
let' s go !
let' s hit it !
start the car , asshole .
i told you he' d show up .
drive !
hit it !
hit it !
they robbed a bank !
wait , where' s my money ?
drive or die !
jesus , john , just drive .
they got a gun at your head .
i' m not going anywhere until i get my 30, 000 .
get these guys out of the car !
i want my money !
you are dead !
go away !
you are so dead !
you' re dead !
i want my money !
we' re dead .
go !
go !
we are so dead !
we are so dead !
get back here , you asshole !
you asshole !
i hit david loach in the head .
i hit him !
it felt good , duff .
that' s super .
nice plan , by the way .
guess i couldn' t visualize it ... ... because there was a gun pointed at my mind' s eye .
see you later .
where are you going ?
i' m certainly not gonna stick around anywhere near the getaway car !
i' m just supposed to leave my car ?
know what your problem is , john ?
not knowing when to cut your losses .
you think that' s my problem ?
that' s not my problem .
wanna know what my problem is ?
you .
are .
the .
problem !
you !
you !
you !
it' s a two way mirror , duff .
i turned 40 last week .
do you know what i did ?
got my colon scoped by dr. spencer .
do you know what he told me ?
you have one of the cleanest rectums i' ve ever seen . " and do you know why ?
during my quiet time here at work , i use a toothbrush ... ... i have here in my desk to get to the really hard to find spots .
just for a really good scrubbing .
you think you' re so smart , don' t you ?
no .
the way you made those surveillance tapes just disappear ... ... just got rid of them somehow .
what tapes ?
will you do me a personal favor , son ?
sure .
don' t ever play me like a flute .
okay ?
you two idiots got real lucky .
i don' t have enough to keep you here .
but mark my words , gentlemen .
you' re going down .
i mean , you' re either going down or , by god , i' m gonna take you down .
but either way , once you' re down ...
you' il stay down !
you' il stay down !
you will stay down !
now get up and get out !
get up , get out !
get up , get out !
get up and go !
get up and go !
don' t touch my door !
hello .
i know you' re wondering where i' ve been ... ... and i know i' ve been distracted and weird , but i promise you ... ... everything' s gonna get back to normal .
i love you and ...
i' il get that .
don' t worry about it .
you lying bastard !
what did i do ?
you pretended to be decent ... ... and now i find out you' re a sick , twisted pervert !
what ?
where did you get this ?
from daddy .
you' re a drag queen !
you are a cross dressing transvestite freak !
and you lied to me .
i did , but let me tell you why .
noreen got into harvard , she needed $30, 000 ... ... i promised to pay for it .
i tried to steal the money ... ... from this guy , but i ended up in a wig and a dress spooning with him .
spooning ?
yes !
then i went into a liquor store with a gun and almost got my ass shot off !
and today i came this close to driving the getaway car for a bank robbery .
and i hit david loach in the face with that steering wheel club you gave me .
crazy david from school ?
plus there' s your father .
what did you do to him ?
nothing .
that' s the problem .
he' s always watching me .
and when i come home ... ... he' s here to take you on dates !
what dates ?
where he squires you around .
you go to bed smelling like english leather ... ... and i have freaky dreams about england .
why didn' t you come to me in the first place ?
why was the hardest thing to tell me the truth ?
of all the things i' ve done these past few days ... ... the one thing i couldn' t do was disappoint you .
do you like my baskets ?
yeah .
you don' t think they' re just a hobby ?
no , they' re amazing !
john .
i know where we can get $30, 000 .
where ?
from my dad .
we' re not borrowing from your father .
i know .
we' re gonna take it from him .
take as in " steal " ?
when he was drunk , he told me he keeps about $50, 000 in cash at work .
at homespital ?
yep .
it' s just sitting there .
waiting for us .
this is gonna be easy .
and fun .
i don' t know , elaine .
stealing from your father ?
what ?
he' s got insurance .
we' re really just stealing from them .
bastards .
yeah .
so tell me again about how you hit david loach in the face .
well , let' s just put it this way .
his ass was kicked .
you are so sexy right now .
you' re not crying .
why would i be crying ?
she couldn' t spell " tarp " ?
wait .
i have a confession to make .
what ?
i never saw the house .
isn' t it cute ?
yeah .
i love it .
i love that kitchen .
elaine said we needed a third person ... ... and there was only one place we could go .
we had to go to duff .
what' s this ?
it' s gruyre cheese .
it' s good .
really ?
is it good ?
is it mild and nutty , yet piquant in flavor ?
named after the gruyres district in switzerland ?
i happen to know what gruyres is , elaine .
i' ve been to gruyres .
gruyre is in france .
whatever , elaine .
so will you help us ?
mom !
privacy !
you hit my head on the car .
i was frustrated .
i' m sorry , duff .
i have to wear a band aid .
are you gonna help us or not ?
i can' t stay mad at you , man .
we have to promise to not say any more mean things about each other .
i have never said anything mean .
you' re a lying bitch .
you' re a bag of crap .
you are .
you' re such a loser !
skank !
okay , super !
so we' re all on board .
well , hello .
everybody ready ?
how about you , anton ?
yeah .
griselda ?
i' m ready , steve .
it' s stan .
i thought you liked steve .
you saw what happened to steve .
screw steve .
i hate steve .
let' s do this .
okay .

i' d like to think the answer to that is obvious .
over here .
cleaners .
they' re leaving .
we' ve got a little surprise for you .
don' t we , rex ?
duff , is that silly putty ?
in a manner of speaking , yes , it is .
you guys , it' s open .
wow , he really likes you .
rex !
my little girl with those two lumps ...
there you go .
he said there was money in here .
let' s look in his office .
smash a window , make it look like a break in .
smash a window ?
think i' m a little busy here , guys .
think he might have caught a whiff of my ...
gruyres cheese .
i can' t find it .
and there' s not one single picture of me in here .
i bet it' s in there .
what ?
organ man .
snack time .
go get the hand .
it' s here .
all right , let' s go .
hold it .
what is it ?

joe .
homespital .
detective charles .

get away !
asshole !
think you could just leave me there ?
loach ?
cheap shot me , then leave me to get pinched ?
i know we sort of got our signals crossed back at the bank ... ... but i' ve got $50, 000 here , and i only need 30 .
well , well , well .
if it isn' t big , bad david loach .
nice nose .
why don' t you go back in the closet ?
i can handle this .
did you enjoy getting the crap kicked out of you ?
you back for seconds , little man ?
daddy !
thank you , mr. warner .
don' t thank me , i thought it was you .
come over here and stand where he was standing .
well , you piece of shit .
wanna explain what' s going on ?
well ...
shut your cakehole and let' s get it on .
let' s go , boy .
in all fairness , i' m younger and in better shape .
i don' t wanna hear from you .
okay , stop it .
well , mr. warner , you' re gonna hear from me .
a lot .
know how i told you i never had sex with your daughter ?
well , i wasn' t being entirely truthful .
we did it the first night we met .
and ever since ... ... we' ve been banging together like a pair of cymbals in a marching band .
so get used to it .
i' il get used to it .
as soon as you get used to walking around with your balls ... ... in a fanny pack !
come on !
i urge you to drop it !
john , wait !
stop !
duff , get in !
stop !
stop !
okay , go !
go !

duff , where were you ?

but they' re stealing ...

citizen , calm down .
they were gonna have sex on my desk .
listen to me .
these won' t hurt a bit .
drive !
i' m trying !
i' m going !
we' ve got to get rid of the dog .
screw the dog .
no !
stop the dog !
oh , my god !
daddy !
i' m fine .
i' m sorry .
you were mean to me .
i' m fine .
i' m fine , really .
it' s a good thing you' re here , officer .
because a crime has just been committed .
put the dog down .
number four .
oh , yeah .
come to steve .
now number three .
oh , yeah .
come to steve .
that' s him .
the guy in the middle and the guy next to him .
they robbed the liquor store , shot the sign , stole the porno mags ... ... and the chocolate milk ...
jeez , they' re guilty , man .
might as well tell me everything .
we got your buddy , your girlfriend ...
you know one of them' s gonna spill .
i don' t think so .
elaine won' t talk .
she' s my fiance .
we have a bond .
fair enough .
what about mr. duffy ?
duff' s my oldest friend in the world .
why are you pointing fingers at me ?
he did it .
he planned it .
he' s the mastermind .
give me a pen .
i' il sign a blank piece of paper .
you can fill it out .
this is not good .
breaking and entering .
animal cruelty .
attempted vehicular manslaughter .
this is bad .
this is really , really bad .
okay , look .
you are so going to jail .
the best idea is to plead insanity .
what do you say ?
all rise .
court is officially in session .
the honorable emmett cook presiding .
please be seated .
good morning , everyone .
shall we begin ?
remember me ?
i have the picture .
i can ...
you know , i don' t ...
i see no cause .
so ...
charges are dismissed .
justice !
i won a case .
what are you doing here ?
i had to talk , john .
look at me .
i can' t go to prison .
i wouldn' t last a day in there .
they' d pass me around like a bag of oreos .
i' m sorry , man .
i mean it .
this is $1000 , duff .
what am i supposed to do with this ?
you know what your problem is ?
what ?
you' re too good a friend .
john ?
people always talk about fate .
i never used to believe in all that .
i' d always hoped we were masters of our own destiny .
and my destiny had become a bet on a horse named m' lady .
that , believe it or not , was a 30 to 1 shot .
i had tried a lot of ways to get the money ... ... and all it ever got me was punched , shot at and arrested .
and they' re off !
so here i was ... ... pinning noreen' s hopes for education on an animal that ... ... couldn' t win if it was shot out of a cannon .
and trailing is number 5 , m' lady .
making his move from behind , the long shot , number 5 , m' lady .
but for some reason , that day ... ... my horse ran the race of his life .
as we enter the stretch , number 4 , dance in the dark , is fading .
it' s a two horse race .
so was that fate ?
i don' t know .
if you show up , do your best and spoon with the occasional judge ... ... you don' t have to believe in fate .
and it' s m' lady by a nose !
because fate will believe in you .
things worked out .
elaine and i got married .
noreen couldn' t be there .
she was at college .
so patty was the maid of honor .
and there on the steps of our charming starter home ... ... surrounded by our special friends ... ... it felt like we were finally starting to live our dream .
the only thing i didn' t figure out was how duff got that $1000 .
well , well .
what have we here ?
okay .
wait .
let me shut it .
i know exactly what you' re talking about .
i just salivated on you , i' m sorry .
saliva shot onto your body .
so do i get paid ... ?
let' s go .
hold it .
what ... is it ?
suddenly i' m william shatner .
let me do this again .
what is it ?
you .
wait .
sorry .
go back .
wait .
okay .
i' m your private dancer .
you' re a bag of crap .
shut up !
you shut up !
what are you doing ?
okay .
super .
so we' re all on board .
stupid bag of crap .
any free landscaping you want .
i' il trim your bush .
how would you like me to ... ?
i don' t want to talk about it .
it' s been a while .
i forgot my line !
mom , privacy !
mom , privacy !
big truck .
nobody does anything ...
i' m supposed to leave my car here ?
you know what your problem is , duff ?
john .
you know what ... ?
sorry .
okay , but i don' t ... ... spoon until ... ... after .
your head is so yellow and furry .
i don' t look fat in this , do i ?
we' ve been doing it ...
i know . ... a lot .
doing it and doing it right
hi , duff .
get on the floor !
and ...
