today is a good day to die .
what' s happening ?
it' s crack .
get some help .
crackheads take up all our time .
what have we got ?
hemmorage .
vaginal bleeding .
probably a street abortion .
we' ve got to open her up .
all the o. r. ' s are full .
we can' t wait .
i' il operate .
you can' t !
just do it !
get him out of here .
15 years on the job and you' re gonna get me canned in one day .
here we go .
forceps !
where is it ?
clamp !
you got her .
all right , i' ve got her .
dave , get out of here .
now !
iabraccio !
what the hell are you doing ?
randall steckle , " diary of a surgeon . " no .
randall steckle , " diary of a surgeon to be .
randall steckle , " making of a ...
forging of a surgeon . " no , pretentious .
randall steckle , " genesis " ?
genesis of a young surgeon . " brilliant !
morning .
nice work .
keep it up .
suddenly , even though i was in a coma , i saw myself .
suddenly , even though i was in a coma , i saw myself .
iike , from above , looking down .
ralph , my husband , was crying .
the doctor was saying i was dying .
i saw myself in the bed and everything .
i started to float out into the hall .
then into this tunnel toward this light .
it was the most beautiful light i ever saw .
i heard this voice .
it was the most beautiful voice i ever heard .
i' m going to take your baby .
but you are going back .
and i woke up , and there was ralph and the doctor .
i was legally dead for 41/ 2 minutes .
but i didn' t see no tunnel and i didn' t see no light .
i did ... and it was so beautiful !
i was in this garden ...
this tunnel and this light ...
then this guide ... and a chariot and music .
terry , i think they' d better get you off medication .
thanks .
what' s up ?
good morning .
there' s trouble in e. r.
you' d better watch your ass .
why are you always asking the patients about death ?
i' il be late for class .
thanks , edna .
the spoils of arthritis .
some rather resilient inflammatory tissue here .
we' re now under the transverse arch of the foot .
the metatarsals ...
brilliant , dr. steckle .
bring all that talent with you tonight .
nelson , about tonight .
i like you .
i have to decline on moral grounds .
there enough atrocity in the world without your own little horror .
it' s ignorance we fear .
when did truth and knowledge become a horror ?
especially to a scientist and a genius like yourself .
how are you doing , mannus ?
fine .
i' ve been meaning to ask you , are you dating anyone ?
identify .
costodiaphragmatic recess .
is it offensive if i make conversation ?
sometimes it' s nice to open up .
like old lenny here , he' s open .
identify .
pylorus .
i' ve heard all the rumours and nicknames about you , rachel .
i' m sure you' re a very warm woman .
not in the least bit repressed .
identify .
your brains .
you want to come over to my place ?
dr. hurley , i need a word with dr. mannus .
i already said no to this .
steckle and hurley are in .
two of the top gpa' s in the school .
i need you to handle the injections and the i. v.
i have no interest in watching you kill yourself .
i think you do .
good morning , class .
today' s exam will be scaled .
three a' s will be given , five b' s and ten c' s .
the remaining four will get d' s and f' s .
as in life , you' re competing not with me , yourself or this exam ,
but with each other .
there are a lot of others who' d like to make a name for themselves .
it' s a shame that the people with the ability don' t have the nerve .
all right , we' il be there .
speak for yourself , joseph .
sure , it' il be dramatic , nelson .
you' il cry or faint , puke at best .
but then what ?
i don' t think you have the balls .
you just bring the equipment .
i' il bring my balls .
did you hear about labraccio ?
dave , it' s a four month suspension .
it won' t affect your scholarship .
forget it , i' m out of here .
you' re the best they' ve ever had .
they won' t let you walk away .
besides , you were wrong .
no , damn it !
she was dying .
i saved her life .
what would you have done ?
they have to make an example out of you to protect their insurance bond .
they' il take you back next term .
it doesn' t matter .
i' d do the same thing again .
i know you would .
that' s why i need you there tonight .
there are a few people i' d like to kill , but you' re not one of them .
i don' t want to die .
i want to come back with the answers to death ... and life .
i can get there with the others ... ... but i need you .
i need you to bring me back .
please .
i' m sorry , man , i can' t do that .
just walk away , dave .
go climb a mountain .
i don' t understand you any more .
you burn your career on a stranger .
now you turn your back on a friend .
iook , i' m real sorry about what happened today .
i won' t make it back without you .
so don' t do it .
dave ...
what if it works ?
i don' t want to be buried on saturday .
it costs $150 more to be buried on saturday .
mrs. amsler , you' re doing much better .
ieave a message after the beep .
i know you' re home .
don' t be late .
bring the camera .
what camera ?
thank god he called a specialist .
no lectures , okay ?
you' re engaged .
grow up .
i' m recording a few last adventures before resigning myself to monogamy .
i didn' t realise .
i thought you were just a pussy marauder .
what the hell are we doing here ?
this is goodbye med school .
ten bucks says he shits his drawers and we' re out of here .
not those lights .
security will come running .
set up over the grate .
i just got the boiler going .
you' re really going to do this ?
just humour the man .
take me down with nitrous , sodium pentathol and a cold blanket .
i' ve got some chilled d5w .
when my temperature is 86 % , hit me with 200 joules .
the shock will stop my heart .
then take my mask off .
you said rachel was coming .
steckle , shut the door .
you handle the injections .
when the eeg flatlines , the brain is dead .
i' il be exploring .
give me 30 seconds .
set the blanket to warm and take me up to 93 % .
inject 1cc of adrenalin , and joe , come in with the defibs .
you bring me back to life .
with brain damage .
resembling in many ways ... a cabbage patch doll .
not with a body temperature of 86 % .
dr. mannus , will you handle the injections ?
wait a minute .
quite simply , why are you doing this ?
to see if there' s anything beyond death .
philosophy failed .
religion failed .
now it' s up to physical science .
mankind deserves to know .
you' re doing this for mankind ?
this letter absolves you of any responsibility .
this isn' t for mankind .
you want to get on " 60 minutes "
sandwiched between andy rooney and the commercials .
tonight , a medical student who experienced death and came back .
fame is inevitable .
that' s the wrong reason .
dr. hurley , electrodes .
don' t you want to be on " 60 minutes " ?
rachel , how about a little nitrous ?
at least i' il go out with a laugh .
dr. hurley , get the blanket .
we' re all professionals .
i' m sure this' il go very smoothly .
can i have your apartment ?
it' s a joke !
one minute .
don' t be late .
start filming now .
you' il have a complete record of the experiment .
promise me you' il go through with this .
one little kiss goodbye .
i' il see you soon .
96 % .
this letter doesn' t mean shit .
iet him sleep .
he' il have a wet dream and think he went to heaven .
now i know why i' m here .
i' ve stated my feelings , goodbye .
are you willing to risk your future for nelson' s fame ?
someone' s coming !
is he dead ?
he' s only sleeping .
talk some sense into these people .
i' il do it .
i' ve got nothing to lose .
just his life !
i can get him back .
just stop his heart for a minute .
don' t think i couldn' t have .
no !
clear .
what are you doing ?
a systole .
you' re killing him .
no wonder you got tossed .
stop this shit .
i did not come to medical school to murder my classmates !
flatline .
they' re getting smaller .
he' s dying .
brain death .
now it' s real .
start filming .
he' s dead , isn' t that enough ?
let me try to bring him back .
just watch the door .
we' re in the room with a dead man .
one minute to go .
start filming !
30 seconds to go .
okay , let' s heat him up .
20 seconds .
89 % , 90 % ...
sodium bicarbonate ready .
i' m charging the paddles .
monitor the ekg .
body temp : 93 % .
here we go .
what have we got ?
not a goddamn thing .
up me to 300 .
begin cpr .
sodium bicarbonate and eppy .
my god !
not a goddamn thing !
98 % .
hit him again .
350 .
nothing .
got him !
steckle , help me .
more eppy .
in .
we got rem .
nelson , can you hear us ?
welcome back , man .
the crazy motherfucker did it !
jesus christ !
steckle , that' s some bedside manner .
you' il make one hell of a doctor .
suck me .
can you recall any specific emotion ?
heat , cold , anything like that ?
you can' t be specific .
did you see a tunnel of light ?
no , but there is something out there .
it' s comforting .
have you any idea how big this is ?
he could use some air .
you guys could get us some fluids .
thanks for saving my life .
it was so much fun .
how do you feel , wise one ?
like a highly tuned instrument .
can you hear the traffic on the lake shore ?
underneath that there' s a hum .
it' s the street lights .
even fainter ...
i can hear a kind of dragging sound .
and it' s getting louder .
no .
i not only hear it , i can feel it .
yeah , your prognosis is excellent .
you' il be great on " 60 minutes " .
it' s bigger than that , david .
i' m sure you' il see to that .
you' re not buying any of this .
you forgot ...
i' m an atheist .
are you all right for a few minutes ?
how' s he doing ?
he thinks he' s back from the dead .
how' s he doing ?
he thinks he' s back from the dead .
that' s what we did , right ?
all we did was get lucky .
i would like to go next .
yeah , i' d like to be famous , too .
it' s not about fame .
they' il build monuments to you .
small stone ones .
rest in peace . " i' m going next .
i' d be willing to go 1minute 20 seconds .
1 : 30 .
are you two so competitive that you' re willing to bet your lives ?
1 : 30 .
that' s it then .
not a bad price to pay for fame and glory .
die to be a hero , but don' t die to be a celebrity .
champ ?
someone ought to stay with him .
i will .
are you okay ?
i' d like to go home .
are you okay ?
you were hyperventilating .
your blood pressure will rise
as your cardiovascular vessels constrict .
god , you' re beautiful .
get some rest .
i bet 24 hours ago you didn' t think you' d be spending the night here .
you were lucky last night , nelson .
don' t push it .
engagem ent party
i want to wish you two the best of everything together .
hello , may i please speak to anne coldren ?
anne ?
hi , i' ve been thinking about you .
how are you ?
counting the days to thanks giving break .
i' ve got to transfer to a school closer to you or get a faster car .
we should' ve married last summer .
my mother wasn' t ready yet .
you know , you' re the best .
if anything happens ...
joe , what' s wrong ?
i don' t know .
i' m just tired .
i' m not making any sense .
i should go .
joe , you' re scaring me .
it' s okay , nothing' s wrong .
i love you .
bye .
nothing .
starting cpr .
cpr and adrenalin , and nothing !
what' s going on ?
come on , joe !
come on , nelson , let me try .
we' re running out of time !
let me try .
i' m doing everything i can !
nelson , step back .
come on , joe !
i got him .
oxygen .
0xygen ready .
cpr successful .
hurley lives .
it' s okay , joe .
it was great .
here it comes .
define " great " .
i don' t know , it' s not thinking about the past or the future .
it' s difficult to explain .
yeah , dying is funny that way .
nelson' s right , there definitely is activity beyond death .
absolutely .
the experience was strange .
it was almost erotic .
he' s dead and he gets laid .
what do you mean , erotic ?
i don' t want you to think it was wantonly sexual .
no , that never would have occurred to me .
it was friendly .
it was something vaguely feminine guiding me .
this could be the conquest of our generation .
the last great frontier .
first you had the sea , then america , the west , the moon ... ...
mr. leary , drugs , the inner journey ...
our former first lady and the outer journey ...
but this is ours !
we did have disco .
fuck the baby boomers .
watch your mouth .
i found something .
remember ?
i came back from the dead tonight .
it doesn' t surprise me .
we had elvis in here last night .
pay when you' re ready , okay ?
was it difficult getting back ?
not that i remember .
but you remember everything else ?
i think you guys are full of shit .
i' m not buying any of this .
i wouldn' t buy it either ... ... unless i' d been there .
so what about it , dave ?
an atheist has nothing to lose .
i' m going next .
nobody' s going next .
you' re looking for answers where there are none .
you just saw what you wanted to see .
give it up .
it' s too dangerous .
we can' t turn back now .
i' m going further .
1 : 50 .
two minutes ...
i changed my mind .
two minutes .
2 : 10 .
2 : 20 .
it looks like we found a winner .
enjoying yourself , nelson ?
joe ...
was there anything negative about your experience ?
no .
nothing .
good .
hold on .
was that your idea of chivalry ?
were you trying to show me up ?
not everything is about you .
nobody seems to want me to go under .
i don' t need your protection .
what do you need , mannus ?
what do you think i need ?
when someone is as smart and driven as you are , and very beautiful ,
it makes the rest of us very nervous .
why did you change your mind ?
i' m the sceptic on this .
if i see there' s nothing out there , there' s no reason for us to go on .
how do you explain the similarity in death experiences ?
people from different cultures see the same things in the same order .
maybe there' s a hormone released by the brain at the time of death .
no , you' re reaching .
what if you go and there is something out there ?
then you can kill yourself , too .
i' m not going to kill myself .
i' m glad to hear that , mannus .
i might miss you .
so why this obsession with death ?
it' s just an interest .
a personal interest .
goodnight .
can i drive you home ?
no , thanks .
i didn' t take the money .
i got the toaster , but too many appliances make you love me .
right , nelson ?
in the end , we all know what we' ve done .
champ ?
come here , champ .
come here , boy .
what are you doing here , kid ?
are you all right ?
are you okay ?
are you lost ?
halloween morning .
rotting pumpkins , burning leaves ,
black cats mating like rats in the alley .
it were as if we felt no fear .
as if we were already dead , and had nothing to lose by dying .
because we lived life so well , and loved life so much ,
we imagined ourselves immortal .
overwhelming the powers that be with our passion for science .
or maybe we were fucked in the head .
hey , i' m joe hurley .
you' re terry , right ?
you had a near death experience .
i don' t want to talk about it .
wait a minute .
i had a near death experience also .
i need someone to talk to .
this thing changed my life .
at first , they didn' t believe me .
what the hell do they know ?
if you have to go to class , maybe we can discuss it one night this week ?
all that day i knew something was going to happen .
i' ve always had premonitions .
once , my aunt was to fly ...
why did you do this to me , joe ?
no !
trick or treat .
it' s halloween .
there' s a full moon .
aren' t we pushing it a little bit ?
i' m sorry i' m late .
i ran into some very big guys .
let me take a look at it .
i' m fine .
where the hell have you been ?
i don' t feel well .
look at you .
just worry about your camera .
nice outfit .
are you ready ?
i' m ready .
who are you supposed to be ?
boner man ?
2 : 20 , don' t forget .
you just hurry up and get back .
you can buy us breakfast .
don' t let go of the rope .
hoka hey .
see you soon .
20 cc' s sodium pentathol in .
86 % .
200 joules charged .
clear .
flatline .
what hangs in the air palpably ?
ls it hope , or the fear of death ?
shut up , steckle .
no , you shut up !
what if he didn' t make it back ?
would you miss him , rachel ?
one minute .
90 % .
give him another five seconds .
why not ten ?
we' ve got the time .
are you serious ?
joey , i trusted you .
stations .
joe , move yourself .
come on , no kidding around here .
who' s kidding ?
what' s going on here ?
92 % .
joe , get it !
come on .
2 : 15 , 2 : 16 , 2 : 17 , 2 : 18 ... 2 : 20 .
hand it over .
this is my lab .
300 joules .
charged .
clear .
breathe !
1, 000 , 2, 000 ...
what comes next ?
knock it off , nelson !
5, 000 .
breathe .
300 joules charged .
clear .
come on , dave .
that' s it !
that' s not it .
it' s a v fib !
try lidocaine .
not yet .
come on , dave .
raise it to 360 .
clear .
try lidocaine .
three fucking minutes .
starting cpr .
joe , keep filming .
i' m going to bring him back .
you lied to me , joe .
we' ve got him .
1mg eppy in .
that was close .
that was way too close .
hoka hey .
what did you say ?
hoka hey .
it' s the war cry of the sioux lndians .
it means ...
today is a good day to die . " so was it , dave ?
i don' t know if i was dead .
i may have felt something .
a dream ... or just a bunch of stuff stored up inside my mind .
you were brain dead .
some electrical current circulating through my body ...
it would' ve shown up on the eeg .
you were dead .
so what happened ?
it' s hard to verbalise .
it' s like being paranoid without the fear .
iike being watched .
you guys were standing over me .
who could be watching ?
the dead .
the sceptic did feel something .
i' m going again .
no way !
i' ve been bumped twice .
four minutes .
labraccio went for 3 : 50 .
that was a mistake .
under four minutes is pointless .
nobody is going for four minutes !
4 : 25 .
5 minutes .
i' m next or i' m out for good .
it' il be hard without her .
but without me ...
or me .
well , mutiny at last .
i trusted you with a brilliant idea .
it was the chance of a lifetime .
give it a rest , nelson .
none of you had my foresight !
rachel , you want to go next ?
be my guest , but this was my idea !
you' re tourists !
i would' ve gone 3 : 30 or 3 : 40 .
i still might .
but 4 : 25 is crazy .
we' re pushing the five minute mark .
it' s dangerous .
you shit , joe .
you said you loved me , joe .
i love you , joe .
buddy ?
skelator , are you listening to me ?
thanks for staying .
i' m on the early shift .
you seem fine .
i' il see you later .
about tonight ...
don' t try to talk me out of it .
why are you doing this ?
i' ve lost people that are close to me .
i want to make sure they' ve gone to a good place .
is that so trivial ?
to tell you the truth , it' s the best reason i' ve heard yet for going .
there' s something i didn' t tell you about last night .
i had this feeling that if i had gone any further ... ... that there was something out there protecting me .
something good .
so you don' t need to go under .
the atheist now believes in god ?
i' m trying to tell you that i don' t want you to do it .
think about all we' il have to talk about ... when you bring me back .
i' m dying .
don' t lie to me .
i' m dying .
don' t lie to me .
mrs. amsler , you' ve fought well .
sometimes we just have to let go .
that' s what the voices say .
what voices ?
they say , " have you done enough ?
have you told everyone you love them ?
i have .
they' re friendly voices .
they' re telling you what you need to know .
what ?
that you have someplace to go .
do you believe that ?
yes , i do .
yes , i do .
hey , fellatio !
got a match ?
well , i do .
your face and my ass .
your breath and a buffalo fart .
do i know you ?
you don' t know jack shit !
butt wad , needle dick , cock bite ,
jack off , limp wrist ,
banana breath , shit bird , bird turd , turd face ,
kiss ass , brown nose , macho wimp , limp dick !
what' s the matter ?
gonna cry ?
cry baby davie .
shit faced , rat turd , ass licking , son of a bitch .
how did it happen ?
i was playing hockey .
about last night ...
it' s okay .
no show labraccio .
that' s not like him .
it' s his way of trying to stop me .
it' s not a good idea to continue .
we don' t need david .
can you do this ?
can you trust me ?
no , but let' s do it anyway .
nitrous on .
see you soon .
how long' s she been under ?
we' re bringing her back .
she hasn' t been under long enough .
just do it , joe .
don' t expect any kisses for this .
aborting fourth experiment .
why ?
why don' t you ask dr. death ?
what' s going on ?
we' re bringing rachel back early .
drop it .
think about rachel .
joe' s right .
91 % .
let' s be ready .
rachel , don' t go in there .
i told you not to do that .
denny !
it' s your fault !
nothing .
take me up to 300 .
come on , rachel .
300 joules .
clear !
got her ! .
v fib .
we don' t have her .
it' s okay , we' il get her .
step me up to 360 .
what did you do to me ?
a short , maybe a circuit .
joe , you charged the battery ?
shit !
starting cpr .
bag her , steckle .
no pulse .
it' s not working .
joe , take over .
she' s been under 4 minutes .
we' re moving to bretylium .
it' s the only way .
don' t do it , you' il fry her .
nelson !
please , don' t !
you' il bring her back ?
come on , mannus .
iidocaine in .
come on back to us .
come on .
wait !
i heard something .
oxygen !
she' s back .
why did you stop us ?
something happened to me today .
there was a girl ...
winnie hicks .
i went to school with her .
we used to make fun of her .
on the train , she started calling me names .
right in front of me !
she was still only ten years old .
maybe you fell asleep .
no , it was not a dream .
i' ve seen some odd things , too .
i thought it was brain damage .
in your case it probably is .
shut that off , steckle , this is personal .
i' ve been haunted by images of women that i secretly videotaped .
they' re all members of the joe hurley video library .
what about you , nelson ?
who' s come looking for you ?
his name' s billy mahoney .
he' s a kid we picked on in school .
it' s no big deal .
then what happened to your face ?
the little guy gets carried away .
wait a minute .
i can understand dave nodding off , and pervert here having flashbacks .
you' re saying this guy physically touches you .
that is not possible !
this is too weird .
weird ?
we' ve experienced death .
now somehow we' ve brought our sins back physically .
when did you know about this ?
after joe went .
but you didn' t say a word !
jesus christ !
we' re scientists .
it' s reckless , immoral and unethical for you to withhold your findings .
rachel mannus may have the answers to life and death .
she was under for five minutes !
if she walks out of that ladies ' room with those answers ,
the whole world will worship her .
just like you do .
you should' ve told us , nelson .
you wouldn' t have done it .
at least we' d have had a choice !
we' re fucked .
rachel , are you all right ?
i' m okay .
i said i was fine .
are you guys gonna watch me ?
come on , billy mahoney .
give it your best shot .
i dare you ...
i fucking dare you .
things from our past want revenge ?
i' m not exactly sure how it works .
but if you see anything , i want you to talk to me about it .
you can tell the doctor .
i' il be in the living room .
is it people we' ve hurt ?
did something happen tonight ?
no .
just try and get some rest .
how' s she doing ?
i think she' s hiding something .
what did nelson do to that kid ?
i don' t know !
we must keep each other informed .
yeah , i' m sorry .
why don' t you guys take off ?
i' il stay with her .
i' m sorry .
we' re gonna get you , billy mahoney !
no !
stop , nelson !
how are you doing ?
i' m late .
i' il see you later .
wait .
where are you going ?
i' ve got to stop her .
good morning , rachel .
no ... no ...
her voices were wrong .
there' s nothing beautiful out there .
losing them is part of our work .
but i was wrong .
you look like you' re enjoying the day .
don' t you remember me , joe ?
yes , of course .
are you a model ?
you could be .
look , i' ve got to go .
i' m not picking you up .
i just picked you out .
mind if i buy you a drink ?
i' il call you this weekend .
fine , i' m in the book .
hey , gorgeous .
who are you ?
what are you doing ?
some crazy girl ...
do i know you ?
would you like to ?
we don' t have to do anything .
we can just lie together .
hold each other in our underwear .
i' il call you .
i promise .
i' m tired of playing the field .
we can stop whenever you want .
it' il only make our relationship better .
i' ve never felt like this before .
of course i respect you .
call me whenever you want .

you' re not real !
anne , is that you ?
is it really you ?
you sounded so upset on the phone .
i was worried .
i took the bus .
what a great surprise .
how long have you been here ?
long enough to see your tapes .
my god !
you' re gonna think i' m leaving you because you slept with those girls .
they meant nothing to me .
i wish they had meant something .
if you had cared for any of them ,
i could have fought that .
but to film all those girls ...
to have so little respect ...
those women trusted you .
you have no understanding of trust .
it' s not what you think .
yes , it is .
hello , is this mrs. earl r. hicks ?
hello , is this mrs. earl r. hicks ?
do you have a daughter winnie , about 26 years old ?

how' s rachel doing ?
she didn' t come out of that bathroom with the answers to life and death .
where are you going ?
can i go ?
it' s a two hour drive .
i don' t want to be alone .
you will remove the left kidney and dissect the lower intestines .
remove the ascending colon from the transverse colon .
proceed to the sigmoid colon and on to the appendix .
where the hell are you going ?
are you okay ?
i would be fine if everyone would stop asking me if i' m all right .
is she getting the heebie jeebies ?
i' m spooking , too .
getting us kicked out of med school won' t get anne back .
mannus !
i' il handle this .
back to work or suffer the consequences .
fuck it .
this must be it .
winnie did well for herself .
she won' t even remember you .
it' s worth a shot .
are you coming ?
no .
iisten , if anything happens ....
if you need me , just honk the horn .
ring , ring , ring .
dave , you should' ve sent a letter .
anybody home ?
hi , is your mother at home ?

yes ?
can i help you ?
yeah , i think you can .

i was a little smaller then .
i just drove up from the city .
that' s my truck .
hello , i' m nice .
he' s nice .
we' re both fucking lunatics .
can i come in , please ?
i' ve got to hand it to you , dave ... you' ve got guts .
this is beautiful .
you' ve done well for yourself .
well , it isn' t medical school .
but i never liked school anyway .
i wasn' t very good at it .
i' m surprised you remember me .
i do remember you .
i also remember the way we treated you back then .
you were a little shy , and i was a real jerk ... and i' m sorry .
what are you talking about ?
that was so long ago i don' t even remember .
iet' s not dredge up all that stuff .
however we made you feel ... it was wrong .
we were wrong .
go on .
i have a family now .
i haven' t been that ugly little girl in quite some time .
you were never ugly .
why did you come here ?
david , help !
i know how kids are .
it didn' t mean anything .
i didn' t mean to come here ...
winnie , are you all right ?
i' m fine , ben .
i' m sorry if i made you feel bad .
i didn' t want to hurt you again .
i' m gonna go .
david ?

no one' s here but the two of us .
iet go !
where the hell have you guys been ?
she freaked in class .
how are you doing ?
fine , for somebody who keeps seeing her father who' s been dead 20 years .
death is beautiful . " what a bunch of crap .
how are you doing , nelson ?
okay ?
i' d like to thank you for the nightmare .
you were so eager to jump on ...
welcome aboard .
you withheld information .
i' m sorry you' re so upset .
you' re not the only one at risk !
i always felt this was unnatural .
steckle , you didn' t risk a thing .
stop !
we' re all in this together .
no , we' re not .
isn' t she strong ?
so independent .
when i get into trouble , i don' t drag everybody down with me .
come on !
what happened to you ?
caught with your videotapes down .
you swore at a little girl .
you' re having bad dreams about your daddy .
i' m really sorry !
you don' t know anything about me .
but dave does , doesn' t he ?
come on , they' re your sins .
live with them ...
i do .
you want to see death ?
take a good look .
it is beautiful .
you' ve already hurt yourself .
do you want to hurt her , too ?
help him find billy mahoney .
just do it , all right ?
don' t leave him alone .
why do we want to find billy ?
young dr. dave thinks he' s solved our karmic problems .
atonement , gentlemen .
atonement ?
wait a goddamn minute !
you' re always running away from me .
why don' t you talk to me ?
my father shot himself .
and you feel responsible ?
there was this door in our hallway and i wasn' t supposed to go in ...
kids always feel responsible .
you could not have been to blame .
you said it yourself .
people we' ve wronged want revenge .
i don' t know if this will help , but going to see winnie hicks ...
i can' t explain , but it lifted ... just asking for forgiveness ...
winnie hicks is alive .
my father' s dead .
your father is in a good place .
he wants you to let him go .
then why is he back ?
here .
where the hell are we ?
we' d better get you to a hospital .
come on , this is a short cut .
i can' t believe i remember all this .
the neighbourhood' s falling apart .
give me the keys !
step on a crack break your mother' s back ...
iast one over is a rotten egg !
come on , boys , salvation just ahead .
this is a graveyard .
nelson , where the fuck are you ?
this isn' t funny any more .
it never was .
where the hell are you ?
right here .
this is where billy lives .
wake up , you little shit , you' ve got company !
i knew he was here ... because i put him here .
billy mahoney !
no , nelson , don' t do it !
i was taken away from my family when i was nine years old .
i went to stoneham school for boys .
i thought i' d paid my dues !
it was an accident .

dave' s right ...
i can still make amends .

nelson ?
joe , i' ve got to borrow your car .

nelson freaked out .
joe and steckle are stranded .
will you be all right alone ?
yeah .

rachel .
sweetheart ...
i' m sorry .
forgive me .
billy mahoney died 17 years ago , and nelson feels responsible .
do you know where he went ?
he ran off to make amends .

that would be suicide .
david ?
no , it' s nelson .
david' s out trying to find you .
i wanted to say i was sorry .
please , tell david .
i' m sorry i got you into this .
no , none of that matters now .
rachel , everything matters .
everything we do matters .

it' s payback for our arrogance .
