how long do you think it' il take ...
eddie ?
let' s see ...
50 years
no , it will take 1oo years
valve 1 , valve 2 , release
valve 1 valve 2 released !
valve 3 , valve 4 , release
valve 3 and valve 4 released !
what' s going on ?
not yet ?
not good eddie , give it more power !
with this much pressure , we can' t do much
father , it' s dangerous
the central valve won' t be able to take much more
it' il be allright , release all the valves
how foolish ...
please seal the valves !
if you can' t surpass the ordinary , you' il never evolve
seal valves 3 and 4
just a bit ... ... a bit more
what happened , eddie ?
what is it ?
th e h awk s pr e s e nt
it' s been twice since this month , have you contacted them ?
yes !
right away
this new machine is total junk
didn' t they find anything during the last inspection ?
they didn' t report any problems
what are you doing ?
stop it quickly !
hurry up , do something !
oh god ...
somebody ... somebody ...
pete !
alright , hurry up and do something ...
we are
ray is sealing the valve
what are you ...
let' s go destroy the boiler
wait wait , you can' t ...
then i' il destroy this one here ...
wait , stop , stop
you want to see them both broken ?
ray' s in there , and he' il be killed !
ray !
move it !
what have you done ?
ray , are you alright ?
ray ...
yeah , i got burned a bit though
the boy , how' s the boy ? !
i' m fine
but the brass coupling valve is trashed , and the pipe too
what ? !
do you have any idea how expensive those are ? !
you little ...
c' mon boss , this isn' t ray' s fault .
and he put himself in danger to shut it down
alright then , the repair fee will be subtracted from your salary , remember that !
i want it fixed by tomorrow , so get to work , understood ! ?
don' t mind him , you did a great job , ray
yep
you can' t do it like this
hear ye , criminal has been identified !
breaking news about the kidnapped priest .
read about the latest lobbying scandal ?
our way of life is unsustainable !
we must ...
special scoop on the murder incident
the suspect was a priest
london thousand exhibition ...
sup ray
hey , chris
i heard about that
your factory adventure
you did a great job , and you' re unharmed
i kept this from the accident
a valve for a brass line
it' s still usable
manchester ...
manchester ...
look at that , alex
what' s this ?
the great inventor , ray steam
both his father and grandfather invent useless crap
useless crap !
useless crap !
yo , i heard that you' re stealing materials from your dad' s workplace
haha , then he' s an inventor thief
maybe just a plain thief
let' s get him , alex
oooowww ...
alex !
wait wait , i' m not part of this !
both my father and my grandfather are working hard in a u. s. laboratory
that' s because they can' t get hired in england
shut up !
the thing that you seek ... what is it ?
even sacrificing everything in this world
that what i' m searching for is se .
se ... sei ...
serenity
serenity .
from time past , a never ending happiness
that exists only in heaven , and it is given to people who seek with humble heart
that' s how it' s written in my book
and thus ... " huh ?
and then he says
your true nature is ...
guess i have to work on this counterweight stage
it' s because they insulted my father and grandpa
also , they started it .
violence shan' t be tolerated
but ma' am , that alex is a really annoying guy .
last time he was cat calling me , he' s a delinquent ...
hey ray , starting today we' re going to sleep at your place
why ?
emma' s mother' s sponsor is leaving for vacation to bradpool
so we' re taking care of them for a week
i thought we were moving because there' s so many suitcases
i' m hungry ...
mom ?
i dont think so .
you hurt someone today
they were about to give him stitches
that' s a lie , i didn' t hit that hard
that' s not important , it' s bad to hit someone on the head with a metal pipe .
alright !
mother !
emma !
it' s done
like father like son ...
he really worries me
mail delivery !
coming
who could this be ?
mother , it' s a delivery from grandpa
ray , don' t make a big mess
ow , be careful , are you alright ?
this ... is grandpa' s writings
hum , what is this thing ?
oh , did he forget something ?
coming
is this professor steam' s house ?
yes , it is
i' m alfred , and this is j ason
we' re from the ohara group in the united states
thank you for taking care of my husband and grandpa
oh , it' s nothing really
they' re both very dedicated
we just happened to receive a delivery from grandpa
is that so ?
then we' re just in time
by the way , is professor lloyd at home ?
what ?
but grandpa is ...
you' re ray right ?
dr. lloyd and dr. edward have told me a lot about you
ray , that really has to be sent to the london museum' s exhibition
indeed , a little mistake of ours
mister , are you really from the group ?
hm ?
that is correct , ray
in that case , i can' t hand this over
ah ... what are you talking about ?
grandpa said not to give it to anyone before his return
that' s right , it' s a very important object
that' s why we came on professor lloyd' s behalf , ray
most importantly , don' t hand it over to anybody from the group
that' s what it says
brother ...
what' s going on here , mr. alfred ?
well then , how to explain ...
that' s what is this about !
grandpa !
grandpa !
ray , you must not give that ball to them !
that ball belongs to the group !
because of that ball , eddie was ...
father was ... ?
eddie was ...
ray , you' re father is dead !
father is ...
de ...
j ason !
dr. lloyd is here , come down !
ray !
run , take that ball and paper to stevenson ! ... to stevenson ?
ma' am !
whatever you do , don' t go to london !
shit ...
you fiend !
ray , hurry !
ray , get out of here !
hurry up !
run !
mom !
let' s go !
ray , go get help !
mother !
ray , c' mon !
hey ray !
move !
the fuse !
it' s the signal
let' s go !
what are you doing ?
that will never work
you haven' t even tested ...
shut up !
it' il be fine , just push !
it' s them , there they are !
ray !
ok , hold it tightly , emma ... what is that ?
it' s him !
that brat has the steam ball , get him !
emma , push it , hurry !
with something like this , can you really escape ? !
ray ...
old man , get outta here !
move aside !
what the ? !
what' s that ?
d amn it !
shit ...
who are you ?
it' s emergency , please move aside
hey ? !
hey !
what is it ?
what happened ?
wasn' t that a little dangerous ?
i almost died there !
my apologies
i couldn' t stop that trackless steamcar otherwise
trackless ... steamcar ...
well done , d avid
mr. robert !
robert ...
stevenson ? !
is this blueprint yours ?
what is you name ?
ray ...
j ames ray steam ...
mr. robert stevenson
j ames steam ... so you' re dr. edward' s ...
hey , they shot up something !
we came to manchester to meet with dr. lloyd , as he requested in a letter
what a coincidence that we' ve met like this .
the situation is more serious than we thought , mr. robert
situation you say ... and those people from ohara group ?
it' s a matter of national security , so ...
i can' t reveal details , but it concerns dr. lloyd and dr. edward' s new invention
mr. robert and your father were lab collegues for 2o years
we were actually more rivals than collegues
in ' 39 when i was in the u. s. your father also ...
my grandpa told me to give this to mr. stevenson
this is ...
bring it !
please stay back , it' s dangerous !
what was that ?
alright !
lift it up !
okay , pull !
just let it go !
he' s still alive !
no choice , let' s try to leave then behind !
don' t interfere
only the ball , drop the brat
hurry up !
no way !
this is taking too long ... get ready !
hey , shut the valve off !
give us the ball
faster !
we' re gonna crash !
train 42 is arriving on platform 7
hey look !
has anyone seen professor lloyd ?
you ?
wasn' t he kidnapped ?
and what is his relation with robert stevenson ?
whatever the reason , we have to clean up this mess
how is it ?
did you get something ?
i believe this system is for measuring the pressure
but the gauge readout ...
i' ve never seen such high readings
perhaps they intended to show us , with this machine , the power of that ball
now that dr. lloyd has been kidnapped , we can only guess
i wonder what incredible amount of pressure was sealed in that sphere
mr. robert ... what will happen to ray ?
don' t worry ma' am ... we will use the power of great britain to bring back ray safely
welcome back lady scarlet , you must be tired from such a long trip
how' s our chairman doing ?
what is this place simon ?
the weather is ugly , the river is dirty and smelly and the buildings are crappy
it' s awful !
shut up columbus !
excuse me ...
please help me , i' ve been kidnapped by bad people
honestly
columbus ?
eh ?
columbus stay still !
you' re such a bad dog
here , i caught you !
hmm , so you' re the son of dr. edward
how do you know my dad' s name ?
oh !
ms. scarlet , i didn' t know you were here
how wonderful
hey , mr. j ames ray steam , sorry for the wait
what did you do to my dad and grandpa' s ball ?
and just who are you guys ?
my apologies
i am the manager of the ohara group , archibald simon
and this is our chairman , charles ohara s aint jones ' grand daughter , ms. scarlet
then ... then , why have you destroyed our house ? !
you really think i can tolerate such an act ?
you might want to wear a lighter pair of shoes , dr. edward
what' s the matter , ray ?
father ... ?
long time no see
well , let' s keep the long stories for later and let' s eat before it gets cold
please have a seat , ray
i' ve heard the story
if my father wasn' t that narrow minded , we wouldn' t have gone so far
we will rebuild your house immediately
there have been a lot of misunderstandings recently
however ray , i' m glad that you came here
it' s not as if i had a choice !
simon , this salmon stinks
i was going to call you eventually with your mother as well
and i wanted you to look on my work
work ?
all of this , it smells like that river
ray , come with me
um ...
professor , you haven' t eat yet ...
hey !
such impoliteness
excuse me ...
hold right there !
father , what happened ?
grandpa said that you were dead ...
he said not to give that ball to anyone from the group and ... your body , father ...
we were searching for highly stable liquid able to withstand extreme pressure
3 years ago , we found it in a mine in ireland
so , using that liquid ...
wh ... what are you doing ? !
that' s dangerous !
what were you thinking ?
be careful on how you' re addressing me
are you stupid or something ?
my name is scarlet , but people call me ' lady '
well then , please hang on to the bars , lady
we' re going , ray
it is 1863 , and we' ve finally succeeded in containing extremely high pressure in a ultra dense state
extreme pressure ...
in high density ...
incredible !
what' s the fuss ?
this is nothing compared to the group' s
that ball is ... ?
ray , that is the steam ball !
it was possible to produce 3 in ireland
with 3 of those spheres , we supply this entire castle' s energy demands
steam ball ...
before , in order to obtain high pressure , we required a massive boiler
and the volume was distributed amongst many cylinders
with its huge mass , energy losses were unavoidable
but look ray , what you see here today is all that' s needed to provide energy
it' s built with our money you know ...
do you know what that means , ray ?
we can even fly freely in the sky
what' s the big deal about flying ?
what' s the big deal about flying ?
before , humanity ...
even i have 2 aircraft before , humanity ...
and my grand father had more ...
before , humanity ...
before , humanity ...
hey you , can you shut up for a bit ?
this is ?
steam castle' s control room
steam castle ...
wow ... hey , look at this
you can see the exhibition from here
this machine is ...
eh ?
exhibition ?
over here , ray
it leads outside for a better view
this way ... hey , c' mon !
look , everything is so small
so , this ...
london ?
you really are stupid you know
it' s obvious this is london because that' s the london exhibition
amazing , it really is an exhibition
our ohara group ...
indeed it is a great exhibition
but ray , it' s nothing but junk compared to this steam castle
but what is the steam castle , father ?
you didn' t know ?
you are so stupid
stop calling people stupid , stupid !
it' s not stupid to ask about something you don' t know
the power of steam castle will soon change its form
and it will be applied to every human industry
freeing humanity from grievance , even confronting natural disasters
we shall spread this incredible technology all over the world !
along with the mark of the ohara group
and it all begins right here
later , this steam castle will be yours
what ?
me ?
this kid ?
the first person who designed this castle is my father , your grandfather
i joined in the construction 1o years ago
and now , we' re near completion
ray , you will help me right ?
let' s finish this castle together
we don' t have much time until the opening day of exhibition
if there wasn' t that incident with my father , by now ...
why isn' t grandpa also working on this ?
our opinions on the philosophy of science have diverged
you will understand in the future
science isn' t an esoteric discipline like alchemy
it is not an exclusive craft reserved for nobles locked away in their palaces
science exists in reality , and can be harnessed by anyone
if it' s not used by people , then what is it for ?
humanity is awaiting the benefits of science
the world is waiting for our steam castle !
i' ve heard about the ohara group
during the north south war , they sold weapons to both sides of the conflict
even today they' re a major player in the world arms market
but i heard that story after the decision to participate in the exhibition
now i' m struggling on how to deal with this issue
that group' s technology is becoming a threat to our country
so you say , but are you not pushing for less investment in research and development ?
wars are won with more than just machines
to be honest , i was underestimating their skills
they ... you mean those from manchester ?
the steam family
what do we have to fear from those who couldn' t even become engineers , dr. robert ?
a monopoly
put aside for a moment the possible risk of a monopoly on a technology
the main issue is whether there will be illicit arms sales during the exhibition
after all , our country' s reputation is at stake
depressurization complete
let' s go back to work , ray
got it , father
we' ve finished our adjustments
purge the water right away
roger that !
columbus ' treadmill has broken
submarine retrieval completed
are you deaf ?
i said columbus ' treadmill has broken and i' m asking you to fix it
why do i have to do something like that ? !
because , it' s your grandpa who built it
grandpa did ?
in any case , i have to stop the machine or the dog will die
it' s name is columbus , you say ?
yeah
if it' s going to splash then say something !
this attached gear was broken
you have to change it
then change it for me
i don' t have the parts
the steam castle uses materials from america , but this is from england
what are you babbling about ?
we' re in london
you can find that kind of thing anywhere
well , i guess so
let' s go search for one
huh ?
well ?
what are you doing ?
shhh , they' il catch us
we' re not suppose to go out
oh really ?
i' m here because i was kidnapped , remember ?
oh , you make it sound so bad
wow !
this is so wonderful
i feel like we' re thieves in the night
the part ...
ray !
hey , come here
shh , be quiet
it will be a mess if someone heard us
look look
isn' t it interesting ?
what ?
it' s only our reflection
look carefully
they are slightly different , a bit slanted from one to the other
really ?
look
everyone is looking at us
i guess ...
what are you doing ?
greetings our guests
guests ?
well , which one of me do you like the most ?
huh ?
which one , you say ...
wow it' s really awesome !
i want to show this to my mom
you really are a naive boy
i am not
you want to see your mother that much ?
who said that ?
i have 5 mothers
what ?
a mother who makes meals
a mother who comes along when i do shopping
and a mother who teaches me
that' s not a mother
a mother who is there when i' m riding
also a mother who tells me stories at bedtime ...
you got a problem ?
you even write a letter to manchester telling your mom how much you missed her
how did you know that ?
because , i found it on the ground
i won' t let you complete the steam castle , eddie
father !
hey father , remember that letter to mother i gave you last time ?
right , i ordered it to be delivered along with my letters
your letters ?
that' s right , i send them once a month to your mother
professor , it' s an emergency
there is a pressure leak in area 5
we just checked that yesterday
but yesterday night , professor lloyd escaped from his cell
u nbelievable , what the hell was security doing ?
the central valve must not be shut off under any circumstances
i know that , however ...
if it continues like this , the whole castle' s pressure will ...
i didn' t know my father was sending letters ... and why is grandpa in ...
condensation levels are too high
cut off the pressure in all unessential areas
ray , can you go close the valve labeled # 53 ?
it' s area 7
got it
5353 ...
can that be ... grandpa ? !
ray !
ray is that you ?
turn off that light will ya ?
grandpa , what are you doing here ?
how about you ?
what are you doing here ?
weren' t you in manchester ?
why are you in london ?
ah !
the ball !
what did you do with the steam ball ?
well , i was kidnapped on a train , along with ...
with the ball ?
oh god how could this have happened ? !
do you know how much planning went into sending that ball to the manchester ?
shit ... damn that eddie
i can' t stay still , i must hurry
d amn it
grandpa !
what are you doing ray ?
because if you open this , the pressure will increase at the central valve
this is terrible !
eddie has brainwashed you , don' t you see ?
ray
then you knew from the beginning that father was alive ? !
someone who went mad because of science ... he' s dead to me !
the world is waiting " ?
for this accursed invention ?
but , father said ...
that fool has sold his soul to the investors
you must not listen to him
he said people are waiting for the power of technology
those are the rantings of a madman
we must retrieve that ball no matter what
you can' t do something like that !
the steam castle will collapse !
shit
no choice , shut the central valve and vent the pressure !
find the section that' s leaking
what a disaster , tomorrow is the opening ceremony
wow !
where are you heading , grandpa ?
shut up and follow me !
wow , incredible
this is the true face of his dream
what are these ?
weapons of war
tools made for slaughtering humanity .
a devil' s invention !
incredible !
you defeat enemies with these , right ?
mo ...
moron !
huh ?
who are these enemies ?
german ?
french ?
english ?
that ... you don' t know until it happens
listen ray .
an enemy is something created inside yourself by desire and greed
people don' t have to think of each other as allies or foes !
don' t you agree , ray ?
y ... yeah
they are profiting off of the basest human desire ... bastards
but father is ... huh ?
it' s the one that destroyed our house
huh ?
you mean giant despair ?
it' s a trackless steamcar made for coastal operations
mother , hurry !
to recoup the money invested in creating weapons ... ... they' re going to sell them to warmongering states at the exhibition
so even if i have to destroy the exhibition ...
what ?
you still don' t believe me ?
is my father really wrong ?
of course , are you mad ? !
i really think that steam castle is a great invention
i get a different impression of my father compared to before
perhaps , he is being deceived by that ohara group
is my father really wrong ?
you' il have to see that with your own eyes and decide on your own , ray
what' s going on ? !
hurry !
ray !
go down !
science is ... ... an engine of human progress
father !
eddie !
aren' t weapons part of that progress , father ?
that dream you speak of , is a mere fantasy of a childish mind !
father , your dream was always too mindful of how others would judge it
what is invention for ?
what is science for ?
i' m through listening to you , you should apologize right now !
ray , i understood after the accident .
i perceived the overwhelming power of science when i was trapped in that steam explosion
power !
yes , science is power
fool
and this steam castle is the ultimate form of power
s aying science is power ... huh ?
who' s there ?
professor lloyd , please stay away from the steam ball
did you see ray ?
that' s their true nature
how cruel , to shoot grandpa !
idiot , don' t shoot in a place like this , are you trying to make a hole ?
if my invention is to be abused by villains , i' d rather destroy it !
what are you doing alfred ?
it' s noisy
grandpa
stop it !
you' re bleeding !
it' s okay , turn this handle
ray , take the ball and run
but grandpa ...
i' m counting on you
go , ray !
idiot , don' t shoot the kid
roger
what a mess
ray , return the ball ...
ray !
okay , be a good boy and give us the ball
ray , take the ball and throw it down the cavern !
fool !
that' il cause a massive explosion !
give up , there' s no escape ... what are you doing ?
you guys , chase him down !
over there !
found him !
capture him quickly !
what' s going on ?
so noisy ...
i' m sorry my lady , professor edward' s son has taken the ball and escaped
eh ?
what did you say ?
hurry up !
don' t move , kid !
stop it !
what are you going to do if you hit him ?
no choice , go
what is that ?
shit
ray ...
what are you going to do , professor ?
the guests are arriving soon
it seems your sick plans are going to fail
don' t worry , we' il blow them away at the opening tomorrow
you just wait and see , father
look , ray
there they are
america , germany , france , russia
each country' s military attachs are arriving
over there
oh , ray , you made it out alive
mr. stevenson
great , i was worried
this is the steam ball
my grandpa is wounded and is still imprisoned in the castle
the ohara group' s castle .
just now all the military representatives have arrived
since i took the steam ball , the castle can not be completed ...
however , they have other dangerous new weapons and they plan to use them to destroy the exhibition
if we don' t hurry , the outcome could be disastrous
other new weapons ...
trackless vehicles and flying craft ... what comes next ?
so ray , hand that ball to us
mr. stevenson
hm ?
what is it ?
what is invention for ?
what is science for ?
science is there for people' s happiness , ray
here
thank you
alright , start the assault
notify the local police about our attack
listen , ray
huh ?
indeed , science is there for people' s happiness .
however , you must protect the government which is the main source of the people' s welfare
huh ?
look , ray
there can be no happiness without a government
it has finally begun
well then , let' s go
where are we going ?
we' re preparing something too
come , ray
welcome , welcome !
it is an honour to recieve such honored guests on the 1st day of london' s exhibition
i thank you all as a representative of the ohara group
simon ?
simon , where are you !
why do we have to chase ray ?
you , where did simon go ?
tell me !
the last time i saw him he was in the central power supply room
it' s me , simon !
explain what' s happening right now !
professor lloyd !
c' mon c' mon , outta the way .
make room
professor lloyd !
professor lloyd , why are you here ?
huh ?
you' re the chairman' s daughter
and you' re wounded ...
emergency evacuation warning , everyone to their post !
what it is ?
what' s going to happen ?
is there a connection with ray' s escape ?
oh , he managed to escape ?
good job , ray !
good job , ray !
hey , stop moving
hey , stop moving
just what happened to ray ?
using the group' s power , they' re fabricating weapons .
ray discovered the truth and ran away
it can' t be ...
now you understand what your group is doing behind the shadows ?
what' s wrong with that ?
we' re just making money like any other company
it was you , wasn' t it ?
the one that' s been telling lies to ray .
if it weren' t for you he wouldn' t have run away with the ball
hey wait up !
open up !
this is the scotland yard !
we will enter by brute force !
what is that ?
ok !
start with this floor !
now dear guests , let' s begin with a demonstration
where are we going ?
here
here ... ah !
this is mr. robert' s workshop
it' s not only your father or the ohara group that are inventors and scientists
take a look at this invention
what is this thing ?
steam tank , prototype # 2
there' s no problem moving forward and backward
but turning the machine is difficult .
with this ball we can do it
d avid , we don' t have much time .
install the sphere into the system quickly
yes , right away !
as soon as you' re done adjusting the front line pressure , set the ball in
hurry , don' t stand still !
thank you for attending this science and technology exhibition .
i am very honoured to announce the debut of this event
i sincerely hope that this event be a beacon of hope for humanity , and advance the cause of science
retreat !
for us english , these exhibition grounds are a very sacred place .
