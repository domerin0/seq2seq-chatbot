the sound of music " ]
there was a boy
a very strange enchanted boy
they say he wandered very far
very far
overland and sea
a little shy
turn away from this village of sin , and sad of eye for it is a veritable sodom and gomorrah .
but very wise
was he
and then one day
a magic day
he passed my way
and while we spoke of many things
fools and kings
this he said to me
the greatest thing [ quiet sobbing ]
you' il ever learn
is just to love
the moulin rouge .
a nightclub .
a dancehall and a bordello ...
the moulin rouge ! ruled over by harold zidler .
a kingdom of nighttimepleasures , where the rich and powerful came to play with the young and beautiful creatures ... of the underworld .
the most beautiful of all these ... was the woman i loved .
satine .
a courtesan , she sold herlove to men .
they called her " the sparkling diamond , " and she was the star ... of the moulin rouge .
the woman i loved ... is ... dead .
i first came to paris ... one year ago .
it was 1899 , the summer of love .
i knew nothing of the moulin rouge , harold zidler ... or satine .
the world had been swept up in bohemian revolution , and i had traveled from london to be a part of it .
on the hill near paris was the village of montmartre .
it was not , as my father had said  a village of sin !
but the center of the bohemian world .
of the revolution musicians , painters , writers .
they were known as " the children of the revolution .
and that which i believed in above all things love .
always this ridiculous obsession with love !
there was only one problem i' d never been in love .
luckily , right at that moment , an unconscious argentinean fell through my roof .
he was quickly joined by a dwarf dressed as a nun .
how do you do ?
my name is henri marie raymond toulouse lautrec monfa .
what ?
i' m terribly sorry about all this .
we were just upstairs rehearsing a play .
what ?
a play , something very modern called spectacular spectacular .
and it' s set in switzerland .
unfortunately , the unconscious argentinean ... suffered from a sickness called narcolepsy .
perfectly fine one moment , then suddenly [ snores ] unconscious the next .
how is he ?
wonderful .
now the narcoleptic argentinean is now unconscious .
therefore , the scenario will not be finished in time to present to the financier tomorrow .
he' s right , toulouse .
i still have to finish the music .
find someone to read the part .
where in heaven' s name are we going to find someone ... to read the role of a young , sensitive swiss poet/ goatherder ?
before i knew it , i was upstairs , standing in for the unconscious argentinean .
the hills animate
with the euphonious symphonies of descant
ha , ha , ha ha ha
oh , stop , stop !
stop , stop , stop , stop !
stop that insufferable droning .
it' s drowning out my words .
can we please just stick to a little decorative piano ?
there seemed to be artistic differences over audrey' s lyrics to satie' s songs .
i don' t think a nun would say that about a hill .
what if he sings , " the hills are vital , intoning the descant " ?
no , no .
the hills quake and shake .
no , no , no , no .
the hills
the hills are incarnate with symphonic melodies !
no .
no .
the hills
the hills  the hills
are chanting the eternal mantra .
frank is living in my foot .
the hills are alive
with the sound
of music
whoa !
the hills are alive with the sound of music !
i love it !
the hills are alive  with the sound
of music
it fits perfectly .
with songs they have sung
for a thousand years
incandiferous !
audrey , you two should write the show together .
i beg your pardon ?
but toulouse' s suggestion that audrey and i write the show together ...
was not what audrey wanted to hear .
good bye !
here' s toyour first job in paris .
toulouse , zidler will never agree .
no offense , but have you ever written anything like this before ?
no .
ahh !
the boy has talent !
i like him !
nothing funny .
i just like talent .
the hills are alive with the sound of music .
see , satie , with christian we can write ... the truly bohemian revolutionary show that we' ve always dreamt of .
but how will we convince zidler ?
but toulouse had a plan .
satine .
they would dress me in the argentinean' s best suit ... and pass me off as a famous english writer .
once satine heard my modern poetry , she would be astounded ... and insist to zidler that i write spectacular spectacular .
the only problem was , i kept hearing my father' s voice in my head .
you' il end up wasting your life at the moulin rouge ... with a cancan dancer !
no , i can' t write the show for the moulin rouge !
why not ?
i don' t even know if i am a true bohemian revolutionary .
what ?
do you believe in beauty ?
yes .
freedom ?
yes , ofcourse .
truth ?
yes .
love ?
love ?
love .
above all things , i believe in love .
love is like oxygen .
love is a many splendored thing .
love lifts us up where we belong .
all you need is love .
see , you can' t fool us .
you' re the voice of the children of the revolution !
we can' t be fooled !
let' s drink to the new writer of the world' s first bohemian revolutionary show !
it was the perfect plan .
i was to audition for satine , and i would taste my first glass of ... absinthe .
there was a boy
i' m the green fairy .
the hills are alive
with the sound ofmusic [ hysterical laughing ]
a very strange enchanted boy
yeah , freedom , beauty
truth and love
the hills are alive no , you won' t fool the children of the revolution
no , you won' t fool the children with the sound ofmusic
of the revolution we were off to the moulin rouge .
and i was to perform my poetry for satine .
yaaah !
harold zidler and his infamous girls .
they called them his " diamond dogs . " the diamond dogs

get down !
where eagles fly
on a mountain high
love makes us act like we are fools
throw our lives away
for one happy day
we could be heroes
just for one day
you you will be mean
no , i won' t .
and i
i' il drink all the time .
we should be lovers
we can' t do that
we should be lovers
and that' s a fact
though nothing
will keep us together
we could steal time
just for one day
we could be heroes
forever and ever
we could be heroes
forever and ever
we could be heroes
just because
i
will always love you
i
can' t help loving
you
how wonderful life is
now you' re in
the world
you' re gonna be bad for business .
i can tell .
how wonderful
life is
now you' re in
the world
how wonderful life was , now satine was in the world .
but in the duke ,
zidler had gotten much more than he had bargained for .
the conversion ofthe moulin rouge into a theater will cost a fantastic sum of money .
so in return , i would require a contract ... that , um , uh , binds satine to me ... exclusively .
naturally , i shall require some security .
i shall require the deeds to the moulin rouge .
my dear duke , i
please !
don' t think that i' m naive , zidler .
i shall hold the deeds to the moulin rouge .
and if there are any she nanigans , i my manservant warner ... will deal with it in the only language ... that you underworld show folk understand .
satine will be mine .
it' s not that i' m a jealous man .
i just don' t like ... other people touching my things !
i ... understand ... completely , duke .
good .
now that we have an understanding , it would appear that , uh , you have the means ... to transform your beloved moulin rouge
into a theater !
i shall woo satine over supper tonight .
we will have created ... the world' s first completely modern , entirely electric , totally bohemian , all singing , all dancing ... stage spectacular !
the show must go on !
yes , the show would go on , but satine would not attend the supper that night or the following night .
you have betrayed me !
mad with jealousy , the evil maharajah forces the courtesan ... to make the penniless sitarplayer believe she doesn' t love him .
oh , yes !
ofcourse !
thank you for curing me of my ridiculous obsession with love , " says the penniless sitarplayer , throwing money at her feet and leaving the kingdom forever .
no !
no !
no !
brilliant ! brilliant !
oh , but a life without love , that' s terrible .
yes , but the sitar player ...
wait , wait , wait ! with the magical sitar
that' s my part , christian !
th that' s my part !
don' t you dare .
no .
his magic sitar , who can only speak the truth , says
the greatest thing you' il ever learn is just to love ... and be loved in return .
a picnic , sweet lady ?
oh , well , we have so much to do , so much work .
well , if the young writer can carry a blanket and basket ,
i don' t why see why you both can' t do it in my presence .
so the magical sitar player falls from the roof  yes , i know .
don' t tell me .
the greatest thing you' il ever
still at it , my sweet ?
master ...
alley oop ! make ... contract .
oh , my dear , sweet duke .
so many lines to learn .
been trilling them over and over .
for try as the duke may , it was almost too easy for the young writer and the lead actress ... to invent perfectly legitimate reasons to avoid him .
mademoiselle satine , i haven' t quite finished writing that new scene .
the " will the lovers be meeting at the sitar player' s humble abode " scene .
i wondered if i could work on it with you later tonight .
but , my dear , i' ve arranged a magnificent supper for us in the gothic tower .
it' s not important .
we could work on it tomorrow .
oh , how dare you !
it cannot wait until tomorrow .
the " lovers will be meeting in the sitarplayer' s humbleabode" scene ... is the most important in the production .
we will work on it tonight until i am completely satisfied .
b b but , my dear  dear duke , excuse me .
i' m sorry .
nice work ! splendid !
bright and early tomorrow morning , we begin on act two the lovers are discovered .
zidler .
my dear duke .
everything is arranged for that special supper in the gothic tower tonight .
you might as well eat it yourself , zidler .
her affections are waning .
impossible .
i understand how important her work is to her , but she' s always at it with that damned writer !
if i don' t see her tonight , i' m ballywell leaving !
no , dear duke !
i' il insist satine takes the night off .
all right .
all right .
8 : 00 , then .
you will come ?
tonight ?
yes .
what time ?
8 : 00 .
promise ?
yes .
go !
are you mad ?
the duke holds the deeds to the moulin rouge .
he' s spending a fortune on you .
he' s given you a beautiful new dressing room .
he wants to make you a star .
and you' re dallying with the writer .
oh !
harold , don' t be ridicu
i sawyou together !
it' s nothing .
it' s just an infatuation .
it' s it' s nothing .
the " infatuation " will end .
go to the boy .
tell him it' s over .
the duke is expecting you in the tower at 8 : 00 .
if i should die
this very moment
i wouldn' t fear
for i' ve never known
completeness
like being here
wrapped in the warmth of you
loving
every breath of you
why live life
from dream
to dream
and dread the day [ wheezing , panting ]
how could i know , [ coughing ]
in those last , fatal days , [ continues wheezing ]
that a force darker than jealousy ...
and stronger than love ... had begun to take hold of satine .
where is she ?
do you think she' il be up and about by tonight ?
tomorrow morning .
confessing ?
what kind of imbecile do you take me for , zidler ?
she suddenly had a terrible desire ... to go to a priest and and confess her sins .
what ?
she wanted to be cleansed ofher former life .
she looked upon tonight as her wedding night .
she looked upon tonight as her wedding night .
her wedding night ?
she' s like a blushing bride .
she says you make her feel like a ... virgin .
virgin ?
you know .
touched ... for the very first time .
the first
she says it feels so good inside ... when you hold her ... and you touch her .
like a virgin .
she' s made it through the wilderness somehow .
she' s made it through .
she didn' t know how lost she was
until she found you
she was beat , incomplete
she had been had she was sad and blue
but you made her feel
yes , you ma a a de her feel
shiny and new , ohhh

harold zidler' s brilliant lies had once again averted disaster .
but no lie , however brilliant , could save satine .
monsieur zidler , mademoiselle satineis dying .
she has consumption .
my little sparrow is dying ?
she mustn' t know , marie .
the show must go on .
allnight the penniless sitarplayer had waited , and now , forthe first time , he felt the cold stab of jealousy .
where were you last night ?
i told you .
i was sick .
you don' t have to lie to me .
we have to end it .
everyone knows .
harold knows .
sooner or later the duke will find out too .
on opening night , i have to sleep with the duke .
and the jealousy will drive you mad .
christian .
then i' il write a song .
we' il put it in the show , and no matter how bad things get or whatever happens , whenever you hear it or when you sing it or whistle it or hum it , then you' il know it' il mean that we love one another .
i won' t get jealous .
things don' t work that way , christian .
we have to end it .
we have to end it .
never knew
i could feel like this
like i' ve never seen the sky
before
want to vanish
inside your kiss
now , uh , this new scene is the scene where the sitar player ... writes a secret song for the courtesan ... so that whatever is happening , however bad things are , th they remember their love , and , um
we could take it from your line , satine .
so let' s take it
we must be careful .
fear not .
we will conduct our love affair right under the maharajah .
seasons may change
winter to spring
honestly , amigo , this is impossible !
but i love you
until the end
of time
come what may
come what may
i will love you
until my dying
day
suddenly the world
seems such a perfect place
my dear !
a little frog !
suddenly it moves
with such a perfect grace
suddenly my life doesn' t seem
such a waste
it all revolves
around you
and there' s no mountain too high
no river too wide
sing out this song
and i' il be there by your side
storm clouds may gather
and stars may collide
but i love you i love you
until the end until the end [ together ]
of time
come what may
come what may
i will love
you
the magical sitar player falls from the roof and says ,
the greatest thing you' il ever learn ... is just to love and be loved in return .
this ending' s silly .
why would the courtesan go for the penniless writer ?
whoops !
i mean sitar player .
come what may
come
come what may
yes , i will love you [ sobbing hysterically ]
come what may
for i will love you
until my dying
day [ ends ]
i don' t like this ending .
don' t like the ending , my dear duke ?
why would the courtesan choose a penniless sitarplayer ... over the maharajah , who is offering a lifetime of security ?
that' s real love .
once the sitarplayer has satisfied his lust , he will leave the courtesan with nothing .
i suggest that in the end the courtesan choose the maharajah .
b but , sorry
sorry , but that ending does not uphold the bohemian ideals of truth , beauty , freedom
i don' t care about your ridiculous dogma !
why shouldn' t the courtesan choose the maharajah ?
because she doesn' t love you !
h him .
h him .
sh she doesn' t love h she doesn' t love him .
oh , i see .
monsieur zidler , this ending will be rewritten ... with the courtesan choosing the maharajah ... and without the lovers ' secret song .
it will be rehearsed in the morning , ready for the opening tomorrow night .
m my dear duke , th that' il be quite impossible .
harold !
oh !
the poor duke is being treated appallingly .
these silly writers let their imaginations run away with them .
now , why don' t you and i ... have a little supper , and then afterwards ... we canlet monsieur zidler know ... how we would prefer the story to end .
hmm ?
thank you , elizabeth .
i don' t want you to sleep with him .
he could destroy everything .
it' s for us .
you promised .
you promised to me you wouldn' t be jealous .
it will be all right .
yes , it will .
he' s waiting .
no .
no .
come
what may
come what may .
she had gone to the tower to save us all , and for our part ... we could do nothing but wait .
my dear duke , i hope i have not kept you waiting .
don' t worry , shakespeare .
you' il get your ending once the duke gets his ... end in .
hey , hey !
nini !
no !
you keep your hands off me !
never fall in love with a woman who sells herself .
it always ends bad !
the boy has a ridiculous obsession with me .
i mean , i indulge his fantasy because he' s talented .
we need him , but only until tomorrow night .
we have a dance ...
in the brothels of buenos aires .
it tells the story ...
of a prostitute ...
and a man ... who falls in love ... with her .
tango ]
first there is desire .
then passion .
then suspicion .
jealousy !
anger !
betrayal !
where love is for the highest bidder , there can be no trust .
without trust , there is no love !
jealousy .
yes, jealousy ... will drive you mad !

noone must see you .
do you understand ?
i understand .
darling , you go and pack , and i' il be waiting .
it' s the boy .
he he has bewitched her with words .
i want her back , zidler .
find her [ winces ]
tell her ... that the show will end my way ... and she will come to me when the curtain falls , or i' il have the boy killed .
killed ?
killed .
forgive the intrusion , cherub .
you' re wasting your time , harold .
stop it .
you don' t understand .
the duke is going to kill christian .
no .
the duke is insanely jealous .
unless you do his ending and sleep with him tomorrow night , the duke will have christian killed .
he can' t scare us .
he' s a powerful man .
you know he can do it .
what are you doing ?
i don' t need you anymore !
all my life you' ve made me believe i was only worth what someone would pay for me !
but christian loves me .
he loves me , harold .
he loves me , and that is worth everything .
we' re going away from you , away from the duke , away from the moulin rouge !
good bye , harold .
you' re dying , satine .
you' re dying .
another trick , harold ?
no , my love .
the doctor told us .
marie ?

only you can save him .
he' il fight for me .
yes , unless he believes you don' t love him .

you' re a great actress , satine .
make him believe you don' t love him .
no .
use your talent to save him .
hurt him .
hurt him to save him .
there is no other way .
the show must go on , satine .
we' re creatures of the underworld .
we can' t afford to love .
today' s
the day [ zidler , satine , chorus ]
when dreaming [ solo ]
ends
another hero , another mindless crime ... behind the curtain ... in the pantomime .
on and on
does anybody know what we are living for [ zidler , chorus ]
what ever happened
we leave it all to chance
another heartache
another failed romance
on and on
does anybody know
what we are living for
the show must go on
the show must go on
outside the dawn is breaking
on the stage
that holds our final destiny
the show must go on
the show must go on
inside my heart is breaking
my makeup
may be flaking
but my smile
still stays on
the show must go on
the show must go on
i' il top the bill i' il earn the kill
i have to find the will to carry on
on with the
on with the
on with the
show

what' s wrong ?
i' m staying with the duke .
after i left you , the duke came to see me ... and he offered me everything .
everything that i' ve ever dreamed of .
he has one condition .
i must never see you again .
i' m sorry .
what are you talking about ?
you knew who i was .
what about last night , what we said ?
i don' t expect you to understand .
the difference between you and i is that you can leave any time you choose .
but this is my home .
the moulin rouge is my home .
no .
there must be something else .
this can' t be real .
there' s something the matter .
tell me what it is .
tell me what' s wrong !
tell me the truth !
tell me the truth !
the truth ?
the truth is ,
i am the hindu courtesan ... and i choose the maharajah .
that' s how the story really ends .
jealousy has driven him mad !
satine !
satine !
satine !
things aren' t always as they seem .
things are exactly the way they seem .
christian , you may see me only as a drunken , vice ridden gnome ... whose friends are just pimps and girls from the brothels , but i know about art and love ... if only because i long for it with every fiber of my being .
she loves you .
i know it .
i know she loves you .
go away , toulouse .
leave me alone .
go away .
go away !
i wanted to shut out what toulouse had said , but he had filled me with doubt .
and there was only one way to be sure .
i had to know .
so i returned ... to the moulin rouge ... one ...
last ... time . time .
she' s mine !
i only speak the truth i only speak the truth
i only speak the truth i only speak the truth
i only speak the truth !

boy [ typing ]
days turned into weeks .
weeks turned into months .
and then one not so very special day ,
i went to my typewriter ,
i sat down ... and i wrote our story .
a story about a time , a story about a place , a story about the people .
but above all things , a story about love .
a love ... that will live ... forever .
the ... end .
the greatest thing
you' il ever learn
is just to love
and be loved
in return
