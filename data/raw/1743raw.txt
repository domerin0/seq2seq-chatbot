25 . 000
let me warn you .
i' m mr. butterfield .
this is my line and my passengers .
you bother them , i' il hound you to kingdom come .
we won' t bother anybody .
we just want what' s underneath that tarpaulin .
i think our cattle are over the ridge .
i can hear them .
how' d they get over here ?
come on , pop .
let' s go for them .
let' s let the dust settle first , son .
ben .
tell him to stay there .
stay where you are !
what do you want ?
i want my cattle back !
he' il get them in 5 minutes .
you' il get them in 5 minutes !
you gonna let them do this to you ?
not much else i can do .
don' t anybody move !
if you move , i' il kill him .
lift him up easy .
put him on his horse .
aren' t you gonna do something ?
what , and get myself shot too ?
that must be ben wade and his gang .
what' s his name ?
bill moons .
where does he live ?
he used to live in contention city .
take him there .
can' t .
my passengers are due in bisbee , only a few miles away .
take him to bisbee and put him on the next coach back .
where a man lives is where he should be buried .
we' il need those horses .
why ?
so you don' t ride to the marshal .
get off .
all right , boys .
get off .
we' il turn them loose this side of bisbee .
you wait !
my pa will kill you !
mark .
let' s get the cattle .
hello there !
could you help us ?
i gotta get the cattle home !
could you lend us a horse ?
yeah , i' il bring one back !
what happened ?
where are your horses ?
the coach was held up .
they saw us , ma , and took them .
and killed the driver !
they killed the driver ?
one of their fellows was on top , taking off these bags ... ... and the driver grabs him as a shield .
do they care ?
no , they shoot through him .
it was ben wade .
ben wade ?
what did you do ?
there were 12 .
what could i do ?
we stood still .
then they took our horses .
we just watched .
what else could we do ?
you want us to get shot ?
boys !
go saddle a couple of horses .
i ought to take them some water too , i guess .
i' m glad you' re safe .
anything could have happened .
there was no danger , not to us anyway .
it just seems so terrible .
why ?
what' s terrible ?
nothing .
what' s the matter ?
nothing .
it' s terrible that bad things happen , and all we do is stand by and watch .
lots of things happen where you can only stand by and watch .
i know , but to have you stand by and to have the boys watching ...
that' s life .
you have to watch a lot of terrible things .
people get killed .
lightning can kill you .
three years of drought killing my cattle is terrible .
but i can' t make it rain .
expect me to cool off the sun ?
dan , why are you so cross ?
you expect something from me that i' m not .
no , i don' t .
not really .
i can' t go chasing after outlaws , my cattle dying all over .
lf they die , don' t know what i' il do .
i' il hold it .
ten years of sweating .
you think i want to lose this place ?
cattle' s not dying at parker' s ranch .
no , of course not .
he' s got a stream that don' t run dry .
have you asked him to let you use it ?
what good ?
six months ' water right costs $200 .
where will i get that ?
oh , dan , you have to do something .
you can' t just stand by and watch .
you work so hard , i work so hard and the boys ...
maybe it' il rain .
what if you borrowed the money in town ?
you know i hate to beg from people .
borrowing isn' t begging .
it could save us .
i suppose i could try .
you gonna look for the horses ?
i' m going to bisbee first .
i' il look on the way back .
that loan would take care of six months .
by then it' s bound to rain .
all this will be green in six months .
the cattle will be fat , and the boys .
maybe you and me won' t be so tired all the time .
in six months we' il be happy , won' t we ?
sure , we' il be happy .
to the boss .
he had to say goodbye to one of us and that' s too bad .
but if it wasn' t goodbye for him , it could' ve been for some of us .
boss ?
is the marshal around ?
in the office .
you tell him the coach from contention was held up .
we passed it on the way in .
they don' t have horses .
did you hear what i said ?
yeah , i heard .
why don' t you go tell him ?
he naps between 1 and 2 .
he does ?
that' s nice .
that way he don' t get tired .
you fellows come from the north ?
down here everybody naps between 1 and 2 .
everybody except you .
the boss is napping now .
i take mine between 2 and 3 .
i guess we' ve come too early .
does this place keep your boss busy ?
no , he does other things .
like what ?
he has a bank and loans money to ranchers .
does he keep the money here ?
he doesn' t have money .
with the drought , nobody pays back .
that' s too bad .
miss , if my outfit' s asking too many questions , you just say so .
we' ve been driving cattle , and when you come to a place like this ... ... and you see a nice girl like you ...
well , it' s nice .
how far' s the mexican border ?
nobody knows exactly .
it' s never been decided .
i think we can find it all right .
when the marshal wakes up , tell him the coach was robbed .
and tell him the driver was killed .
killed ?
killed .
if there' s killing , i' m to wake him .
it' s only robbery he don' t want to be waked for .
marshal !
the coach was robbed and bill moons killed .
marshal , these fellows outside seen it !
how far back was it ?
about 10 miles .
they took the horses too .
did you hear that , marshal ?
why didn' t you try and help ?
we were strung out .
we didn' t see it till we looked back .
right .
go get everybody .
where are you fellows from ?
prairie cattle company .
didn' t know they got this far .
they bought 60, 000 in mexico .
they sent us to drive them in .
you won' t be staying ?
no , just long enough to have a drink .
alex potter !
i told you he had rheumatism !
anyway , he sold his horse .
he can use one of my horses !
suspicious old goat .
where' s alex potter ?
sleeping it off .
i don' t think he wants to leave town with us here .
scatter across the border .
we' il meet in nogales tonight .
what' s holding up the boss ?
don' t worry , he' il be along .
he can handle that hick posse single handed .
come on .
didn' t i see you some place ?
did you ?
yeah , did you ever ... ?
did you ever work in cheyenne ?
el paso ?
no .
did you ever work in the blind irishman in dodge city ?
yeah , i sang there .
best time i ever had in my life .
what made you quit ?
i got to coughing too much .
doctor said i should breathe dry air .
you sure come to the right place here .
i spent more money in that place ...
did you remember a girl , her name was ... ... pauline ?
a heavyset girl .
and velvet ?
remember her ?
i spent 300 in one night on her .
remember , they had real paris dresses there .
real paris perfume .
you have to treat a woman right .
i' d have spent every cent on her except she married the governor .
many young fellows around this place ?
no , they' re all older .
you must get ionely .
hey !
where are they ?
where' d they go ?
alex !
that way .
ain' t you gonna help catch him ?
wish i could .
how' d they look ?
it' il be easy .
three big men on three white horses .
three white fellas on three big horses , huh ?
ever sing anymore ?
who' s there to sing for ?
you know , you look kind of skinny .
i feel skinny .
i don' t mind a skinny girl .
just so she has blue eyes to make up for it .
you got blue eyes ?
brown .
it' s all right .
they don' t have to be blue .
must be they buried their man here .
if i had my way , there' d be more than one .
hello , you the marshal ?
you see the butterfield coach ?
this is mr. butterfield .
they got a gold shipment .
see where they went ?
bisbee .
we just come from bisbee .
didn' t you see an outfit ?
must have been 12 , all on dark horses .
you didn' t see them ?
yeah , we seen them .
then they left .
cy , you' d better go along , hitch up the coach down there .
we think it was ben wade .
what do you know ?
there i was , face to face with ben wade .
hi , marshal .
did you catch them yet ?
them were the fellas back in bisbee .
yeah ?
one of them is still there .
he went into the saloon .
you been drinking this morning or not ?
i never touch a drop until noon .
there' s a man there .
let' s catch him .
what if it' s ben wade ?
what good is catching him ?
we' il arrest him .
till his outfit comes back and shoots up the town ?
no one' s held him yet .
we' il get him out of town .
we won' t catch him standing here .
let' s go .
are you coming , dan ?
yeah , i' m coming .
what will happen is somebody will get hurt bad .
think you' il ever get back to bisbee ?
don' t look like it .
that' s what i figured .
i never stay long anyplace .
do you care ?
sure , i care .
what can i do ?
you' re on the go , and i' m stuck .
i ain' t complaining .
i got something to remember .
me too .
funny , some men you can see every day for 10 years ... ... and you never notice .
some men you see once and they' re with you the rest of your life .
what happened ?
finishing my drink .
there' s a fella coming down the road .
hello , mr. evans .
you want something , mr. evans ?
something i can do to help you ?
you drove off my cattle .
you got them back .
yes , it took me a half day .
what' s half a day worth ?
when i hire out a full day , i get two dollars .
here' s two dollars for half a day .
then that' s what i' il settle for .
there' s two more for you .
what for ?
for your boys .
i used their time too .
if you don' t mind , you owe me two more for tiring out my cattle .
two more for tired cattle .
is there anything else you wanna get paid for ?
you can give me two dollars extra for making me nervous .
don' t move .
it' s the marshal .
he' s got a shotgun on you , wade .
put your hands up .
ben ?
watch him .
i' il watch him .
now what good is all that ?
he' il come back with the others ... ... and i' il go free .
and you' il get shot .
we' il get you out of town so fast you won' t touch ground .
over here .
sit down , there .
here , take this .
i helped out this far .
i' m finished .
you' re what ?
finished .
i come here on business .
i got to take care of my cattle .
you' re our best shot .
that' s not my job .
i' m no deputy .
you are now .
every man is a deputy .
i was coming to see mac .
i don' t mind helping , but that' s all .
i can' t spare time .
i' il lose everything .
that won' t make any difference .
mac , you watch him .
can i talk to you a minute , mac ?
what' s it about , dan ?
well , it' s a business thing , you know .
sit down .
thanks .
the faster we get him out , the safer .
that' s right .
we' il outsmart them every step .
we only got two , three hours head start .
they' il think we' il turn him in at fort huachuca .
sure , they will .
or they' il think we' il go to benson .
that' s a fact .
10 to yuma .
sure , they' re bound to .
alex , will you let me finish ?
then you can agree .
sure .
when the coach comes , we' il put him on it and start .
start where ?
that' s where we fool them .
look ... ... here' s benson .
here' s contention .
and here' s fort huachuca .
it' d only be for six months .
it' il rain by then .
rain ?
sure , everybody would prosper .
i only need 200 .
lf you were my own brother ... ... i still couldn' t help you .
i guess i' d better be getting back home .
how' s the missus ?
she' s fine , thanks .
good .
how' re the boys ?
fine .
they' re fine .
i need two volunteers .
do i have two volunteers ?
for what ?
i' m not telling you for what .
two will go with dave keene .
we' il follow with the prisoner .
who' il volunteer ?
we gotta know what to expect .
sure , might not be safe .
safe .
who knows what' s safe ?
a man died from looking at his wife .
my grandma fought the indians for 60 years , then choked to death on pie .
do i have two volunteers ?
i' il pay $200 to each man .
i' il volunteer .
you said you couldn' t ...
do you want me or don' t you ?
sure , we do .
here , take this shotgun .
now , do i have another ?
i' il go .
wait a minute , alex .
no offense ... ... i just think it' d be safer if we had somebody else .
come on , give me a chance .
anybody else ?
alex potter and dan evans .
where are we going ?
here' s the plan .
we' re gonna transfer him at your house .
my house ?
it' il only take a minute .
everybody , out .
we need the coach .
you' il have to stay here tonight .
get another team , a four up .
get bill moons out .
there' s a coach to contention tonight , i' il send him over in that .
lively , now .
lively , everybody .
get up !
come on .
you mean to say i have this all to myself ?
well , that' s very thoughtful of you .
bye , emmy .
goodbye .
tell you what , i' il send you something .
would you like pearls ?
i' il send you some .
then maybe you won' t forget .
i won' t forget .
i seen ' em .
you know what to do .
we' re coming to it .
i' il try .
all right , let' s get him down .
all right .
hello , can you give us a hand ?
get ready , come on .
heave !
all right , get out !
heave !
it worked .
those two will round up the rest and chase the coach .
there .
supper' s ready .
take this out to mr. potter .
you' re welcome to share what we have .
here' s your stew , mr. potter .
thanks , matthew .
you know where your pa keeps a drink ?
no , i don' t .
don' t you know where he keeps a jug ?
no .
you don' t mind my asking , do you ?
no , pa said you would .
we always wait for mother to start .
and we don' t teach others manners .
you didn' t say grace .
she always says grace .
she comes from san francisco .
mark .
her father was a sea captain .
he owned a ship .
two ships .
eat your supper .
lf he was here , he' d shoot you dead .
dead as a skunk .
that' s enough .
lf he wants , my pa can shoot you too .
he can shoot anything .
he can shoot a cougar a mile away .
go ahead now and eat your supper .
it' s good stew , ma' am .
thank you .
you didn' t say grace because he' s bad ?
i simply forgot .
can' t you say grace with bad people ?
grace is for everybody , dear .
then why don' t you say it ?
dear lord , we thank thee for life and for food .
we ask thee to give us the wisdom that comes with silence .
amen .
i didn' t close my eyes once .
i just squinted , because you could run away .
why would i want to run away ?
this is real nice .
would you like me to cut your meat ?
yeah , would you , please ?
thank you .
would you mind cutting the fat off ?
i don' t like fat .
what was it ?
me .
i thought i saw something moving there .
they could' ve heard that .
guess i got spooky .
i was in san francisco once .
i knew a girl there .
she was a sea captain' s daughter too .
and she had the greenest eyes .
i used to look deep into her eyes and they' d just change colours ... ... get all fiery and green .
all the colours of the sea .
funny how a woman' s eyes will change colour at nighttime .
alice .
you go inside , alex , and don' t take your eyes off him .
what was alex shooting at ?
why did you have to sit there listening to him ?
what do you mean ?
all big eyed and listening to him .
something' s moving down there .
they don' t know he' s here , do they ?
no , they think he' s in the coach .
that' s how we planned it .
matthew , mark .
yes ?
get the horses .
which ones ?
they' re saddled .
what happens when they catch the coach ?
they' il have to round their men up , so they won' t catch up to it till noon .
they' il find out .
by then we' il be in contention , and they can' t get there in time anyway .
alex , turn down the lamp , and when the horses come , bring him out .
don' t worry .
this is safer than being with the coach .
the boys are so proud .
what ?
proud of you .
their own father capturing ben wade .
didn' t you see them looking at you ?
no , all i saw was wade .
and i' m proud too .
put him on the middle horse .
alex , you lead .
i' m obliged for your hospitality .
i appreciate it , and your husband too .
i hope i can send him back to you all right .
what did he mean , he' il send him back all right ?
he was just talking .
do you think anything will happen ?
sure .
he' il come back with $200 . $200 is a lot .
not if he doesn' t come back , it isn' t .
what' s wrong ?
can i see my wife from here ?
no , you couldn' t possibly .
maybe that' s why i feel so good .
you mind telling me where we' re going ?
we' re going to contention city .
we' il wait there .
10 comes in , we' il put you on it .
thanks .
now , if we get separated , i' il know where to wait for you .
walk your horses .
we don' t want to wake up the town .
is that the house ?
it was , but the man' s afraid .
afraid of what ?
the only thing i could arrange was a room at the hotel .
well , at least we got this far .
i' il go on across for a look .
we' il meet at the rear of the hotel .
step down easy , wade .
we' re ready for you , the bridal suite .
anyone in the lobby ?
one guy sleeping it off .
make sure no one knows we' re here .
alex , keep a watch at the town' s edge .
what could happen ?
why don' t you relax ?
i' m practically on the train .
is that the drunk ?
yeah .
it' s the front room upstairs .
the key' s in the door .
cover downstairs .
alex' il come if he sees anything .
you give me great confidence .
10 yet .
sit down on the bed if you want .
you must be ... ... very tired by now .
why don' t you sit and have a little sleep ?
i' il hold the shotgun for you if you like .
no ?
i don' t have anything against you personally .
i' m doing it for the money .
i know .
if you start across ... ... this eight feet between us ... ... i' il pull both triggers at once .
this is the bridal suite ?
i wonder how many brides ...
is it a little hot in here ?
you notice it ?
kind of warm .
you mind if i open that window ?
think you can reach it from where you are ?
it' s too far .
i' il open it .
want me to give you a hand ?
sit back .
go ahead .
you don' t take any chances , do you ?
where' s your sporting blood ?
back home with my wife and boys .
they usually leave a stick around .
you can prop it open .
they usually stand it in a corner somewhere .
see it ?
right over there .
right there .
feel better now ?
i had to try you out .
i didn' t think you' d shoot .
you know i will the next time .
do i ?
see anything ?
not for miles .
quiet here ?
like a tomb .
did you come in for a drink ?
first time i can remember , i don' t want one .
scared ?
which room is he in ?
second floor in front .
don' t think i' m too scared of wade' s gang to do what' s necessary .
tell dan he can count on alex potter right to the end .
i' m gonna ride on back and keep watch .
how long has he been there ?
i only know , when he come in ... ... he asked me if i' d seen a big woman in a purple hat .
sure is some sleeper .
he sure is .
how much money do you make ?
not very much .
you figure that' s your business ?
yes , i do .
how do you figure ?
you must need money bad to do this .
maybe i do .
how much they paying you ? $200 . $200 ?
that' s a lot of money .
how' d you like to double that and save yourself time and trouble ?
how do you reckon i' il do that ?
drop that gun and let me walk out .
it' s worth $400 to me .
kind of reckless of you .
especially since you' re sure your men are coming for you .
oh , they are .
yes , they' re coming .
only , i like to do things real easy .
real peaceful .
you want to look out at a peaceful scene ?
you might recognize somebody .
that' s mrs. moons in front .
the young man ... ... that' s his son , bob .
she had another son .
he was the stagecoach driver , bill moons .
he used to drive the coach .
remember him ?
yes , seems to me i do .
a hotheaded fellow , wasn' t he ?
not reasonable , like you .
i sure am , friend .
i' m so reasonable i' il let you walk right out of here .
10 , and i' il be behind you with a shotgun .
i can tell you' re a very intelligent man ... ... and i wouldn' t want to try to corrupt your morals .
mighty nice of you .
know something ?
i think i know what' s bothering you .
i wouldn' t dream of suggesting ... ... you let a murderer walk out free .
but you see , bill moons drew first .
that makes it self defence , doesn' t it ?
i don' t go around just shooting people down .
that isn' t nice .
i work quiet ... ... like you .
all right , so you' re quiet like me .
well , then shut up like me .
hey , is that the right time ?
yes , sir .
why didn' t you wake me ?
you didn' t ask me to .
anybody come in lately ?
you mean , to engage a room ?
yeah , any strangers come in town ?
not since you went to sleep .
might as well go .
she won' t come .
who were you planning to meet ?
my wife .
she ran off with a travelling man .
i figured he' d bring her here .
what do you know ?
mine ran off too .
i wonder why they do that .
i don' t know .
i always treated mine all right , never hit her too hard .
i' m gonna go outside and wait .
if she don' t come soon , i' m gonna go .
sure would like to get my hands on her .
thank you .
three years ' drought ain' t bad .
at one time they had 10 years of drought right around here .
a big outfit , they got nothing to worry about with drought .
they got all the water they need .
with a little money , you can get almost anything .
maybe so .
cowpokes like us just don' t belong in that kind of a business .
trying to make a go .
killing ourselves .
trying to make a go of it alone .
got to have money behind you .
ever think of taking on a partner ?
i work alone .
a silent partner , with money .
say ... ... $7000 .
you think that' s my price ?
just think ... ... with $7000 you can do everything you' ve ever dreamed of .
think it over .
nobody needs to know .
maybe you come higher ?
maybe .
all right .
when you decide , let me know .
i' il let you know .
what' il it be ?
anybody want whiskey ?
everything go all right ?
all right .
you couldn' t wait for the preacher .
george prayed .
prayed real good too .
sorry more people weren' t there to hear it .
things come to a pass when the boss can' t go to a man' s funeral .
really , i can explain .
especially when the labourer was protecting the employer .
god rest his soul .
as for your soul ... ... you' il have neither cooler nor hotter place than this .
if i can do anything to help you decide , let me know .
how can i trust you ?
about the $7000 ?
yeah , how do i know i' il get it ?
because it' il be 10 .
10 ?
see , that makes it easier for me .
i count by 10s .
do me a favour , will you ?
don' t talk to me for a while .
sure .
of course , you know ... ... it would be easier if we could get it settled .
you shut up .
now you just sit there and shut up .
you mean , we' re not together ?
we' re not even close .
at about five minutes to 3 ... ... we' il be a lot closer than you think .
who is it ?
butterfield .
what do you want ?
i' ve got coffee for you .
leave that shotgun where it is !
he found out and pulled a gun .
he' s been drinking .
10 ?
i' il save everybody a long ride .
that fair , wade ?
shoot and you' il hang for murder .
stay or i' il shoot you .
hand me that gun .
get out of the way !
hand me that gun or i' il push you through that wall .
you' re pretty good .
what if somebody heard that shot ?
don' t you go blaming yourself because it isn' t your fault .
you' d have seen the same thing in benson ... ... or huachuca .
no matter where you take me ... ... somebody would be riding for help right now .
when one of us is caught , we figure the places where they' d take us .
then we send one man to each of those places ... ... to wait .
and watch .
i wouldn' t worry too much , though .
he might not be back in time .
he won' t .
he can' t possibly .
what' il we do ?
we can' t just wait .
if i were you , i' d get some help .
just in case .
moons , are you going to run ?
or will you help dan put me on the train ?
butterfield isn' t .
i am .
i give you my word .
i' il walk with you every step of the way .
we' il see .
we' il see .
i seen a fellow riding out .
we know .
get back out and keep watching !
get the sheriff .
tell him to get as many deputies as he can .
sheriff' s out of town .
what do you mean ?
he took a prisoner to tucson .
we' il do it without him .
mr. moons , are you with us ?
if it' s a fair fight , sure .
i' d stay for that .
fair fight , that' s a man' s duty .
but this way ...
this is a big outfit , wade' s gang .
tough .
another time , but my mother ...
one son buried ...
go on .
go on , get out .
i' m sure i can get help .
even five .
five men would give us a chance .
five would be easy .
certainly in a town this size you can get five .
the street seems to be clearing .
everybody going inside .
i guess they figure a storm is blowing up .
any news ?
not a word .
think they' il find out where alex and dan took wade ?
i don' t know , but i won' t take the chance .
maybe there' s still time .
i like a girl singing .
you like a girl singing ?
i don' t know , it kind of keeps a man from working too hard .
puts his mind at rest .
of course , she doesn' t have to be singing .
dan , what time does the watch say ?
almost 2 : 30 ?
that leaves you one half hour to decide .
i figure when they get here , they won' t come right up .
and if they try to , they' il find you dead .
yeah .
that' s why they' il wait until we leave for the station .
no , i think i' il just take a little rest .
we got help .
we got five down in the lobby .
that makes eight .
keep them in the lobby .
don' t let anyone start anything .
if they don' t try to get in , we don' t start it .
it' s almost 2 : 30 , dan .

what time did he say it was ?
2 : 30 .
when i was having supper with you last night ... ... i was just sitting there , and i was thinking ...
maybe someday i' d like to have a wife .
yeah , must be real nice ... ... having a couple of boys like that to ride out with every morning .
and then a woman like that ... ... every night .
real close .
that must be nice .
i' il tell you , i' d treat her better than you do .
i' d feed her better , get her pretty dresses she' d be happy wearing .
and i wouldn' t make her work so hard .
yeah , i bet she was ... ... a real beautiful girl before she met you .
i told you to shut up !
one more word and i' il cut you down !
you won' t .
i' d say you tried to get away .

i hear you .
do you believe me ?
maybe i do .
go look out the window .

they' il kill us first .
ben , tell him what' il happen if we hear a gun .
he knows .
he knows .
your turn , general .
what do you expect me to say ?
something that makes sense .
something that makes sense for your wife and children too .
you' ve got a real twisted mind , haven' t you ?
take a look , dan .
don' t you wanna see them ?
i' il see them soon enough .
all right .
break it up .
hey , dan .
dan , don' t make it hard on yourself .
all you gotta do is drop the gun and let me walk out the door .
listen .
why are you squeezing the watch ?
you sure no one would know ?
squeezing that watch won' t stop time .
you shouldn' t get so scared .
you might make a bad move .
he said there were only a few .
i counted seven .
i didn' t figure on a shootout .
come on .
just a minute , fellas .
please .
can' t you see we need you ?
there' s one of your outfit , dan .
what time is it now ?
what time do you figure it is , dan ?
about 2 : 40 ?
that' s one of your outfit walking out on you .
they' il all walk out on you .
why shouldn' t they ?
i' il pay you each $50 .
don' t you have a duty ?
you wanna see us shot ?
please .
i' m asking you .
please , i' m begging you .
nobody wants to walk out on you .
this happened in bisbee .
why bring your troubles here ?
we' ve got families .
every man here is a family man .
dan' s a family man too .
i' m a family man , in a way .
let' s get out of here .
you see , dan , everybody wants to live .
butterfield too .
he' il walk out .
no , he won' t .
he' il stick .
he' s human .
at five minutes to 3 , butterfield will walk out ... ... and leave you all alone .
now what do you figure you' re gonna die for ?
because butterfield lost his gold shipment ?
because a fool got what he deserved ?
i' m going up to talk to dan .
you watch out from here .
drop the gun .
dan , the roof !
take good care of him .
dan , open up .
what happened to alex ?
i heard shots .
i ran .
they were dragging him to the hotel .
dan !
guess that leaves just the two of you .
if there' s one more shot , i shoot you .
tell them .
hey , charlie .
you' ve got one more shot .
make it good .
we' il use it going to the station .
go see what they did to alex .
listen to me , dan .
i' m not going through with it .
and you aren' t either .
what happened to alex ?
dan ...
what happened ?
dan , if you think you have ... ... any obligation , you don' t .
i' m releasing you .
alex is dead .
the odds are changing , aren' t they ?
now it' s one against seven .
you have no obligation .
you' d better listen to what he said .
you' d better ...
you' re real lucky , dan .
a woman like that to come home to .
alex .
dan ?
where are you ?
here .
if he moves an inch , give him both barrels .
dan , where are you ?
alice .
did you hear that thunder ?
lf you' re doing this for me ...
if it rains ...
if it' s something i said ...
everything would be green .
dan , please don' t be stubborn .
i heard thunder .
dan , there' s no thunder .
there won' t be rain either .
if i ever said anything that made you think ... ... i was complaining ... ... it just isn' t true because i love everything .
every minute .
all the worry , all the work , all the hurts of life .
if it' s the $200 you need , i' il still pay .
don' t go through with it .
i' ve got to .
for the money ?
no .
for me ?
no .
then why ?
i' ve got to , that' s all .
i don' t want a hero .
i want you .
if i didn' t have to do it , i wouldn' t .
but i heard alex scream .
he gave his life because he believed ... ... people should be able to live in peace together .
you think i can do less ?
don' t .
no , please don' t go through with it .
you know i' ve never been able to give you very much .
no pearls , nothing .
sometimes not enough food for the family .
maybe this' il be something worth remembering .
what are you saying ?
don' t you think you' il make it ?
of course .
at 3 : 00 , i' il walk to the station .
then why are you talking about a memory ?
i mean , the boys' il always remember ... ... i walked ben wade to the station .
you go downstairs .
i' il be down in a minute .
it' s time , wade .
butterfield , i' m gonna take him out the back way .
stay with alice .
as soon as we get near those cattle pens ... ... take alice and drive her out of town as fast as you can .
all right , then .
alice , i don' t want you to worry .
i' il get him to yuma .
then i' il be right back .
i' il be waiting .
one more shot and i' il cut you in two .
i told you , you have just one more shot .
next time , make it good .
there they go !
you' il have trouble making that next corner .
that' s thoughtful of you , friend .
go first and you' il get it from ahead .
go last and you' il get it from back here .
worked all right , didn' t it ?
it worked real good .
wait .
one of my men up there on the roof .
why don' t you wave to him ?
well , right on time .
i won' t have to wait .
there' s still time to get out of this .
there' s still time .
cross the street .
here we go .
now .
they' re headed for the train !
why the stop ?
to do you a favour .
run before they chop you down .
move .
all right .
that' s not so far .
we should make that real easy .
tell them to come out .
you tell them .
too bad , dan .
you made a nice try .
we' il be on that baggage car .
stay where you are !
drop , ben !
drop , ben !
drop !
go down , ben !
i' il kill him !
let' s go .
how do i know you' il jump ?
you' il have to trust me .
jump !
why' d you do it , ben ?
i don' t like owing any favours .
you saved my life at the hotel .
besides , i' ve broken out of yuma before .
well , my job' s over when i get you there .
