dave , we could also do these in blue .
we had to make a weidmann film !
he has three oscars .
he' s a genius .
seor wences !
lipstick , hair and his hand !
he had an 85 year career !
do you remember ?
huh ?
all right ?
don' t talk to me about genius .
remember the nut in the woods ?
ted kaczynski .
the guy at fox ?
the unabomber .
remember he lived in that cabin ?
so ?
hal weidmann bought that cabin from the government ... ... and moved it onto his property .
that is where he edits his movies .
that is his little , twisted ... ... sicko office .
it' s him .
on the phone .
who ?
hal .
i' il kill him !
that sick son of a bitch bastard .
put him on the speaker .
hi , hal .
how are you , darling ?
you' re in my thoughts .
i want to send you a basket .
how' s the film ?
finding its way .
could it find its way here ?
we have a few things to do , like finish it .
it' s finished , dave .

how is it ?
my mother thinks it' s my best work .

i love them .
i have no notes .
when' s the press junket ?
weekend of the 21 st .

i want the press to see it first . we' il experience it together at thejunket .
i' m the head of the studio .

lee ?
danny can handle it .

danny cannot handle it .
it' s his first junket .
i need the master .
you' re a legend at working the press .
i want to stay a living legend .
lf not for me , do it for my father .
you worked together a long time .
you bonded .
he was psychotic .
you spoke at his funeral .
i loved him .
you , i can' t stand .
do this for me .
please .
the studio' s going under !
no hit in two years !
it may be the last eddie and gwen movie , and i can' t get my hands on it !
what do you want ?
i' il tell you what i want .
lf people think eddie and gwen are reunited , they' il see the film .
make it happen .
that' il be easy .
make it look like it could happen .
she has a restraining order against him .
he' s in some mountaintop nut hut .
i don' t care !
i need eddie and gwen back together again , smiling and happy !
we can sell it .
and the spaniard ?
unless i get a script called i schtupped castro , i don' t know .
so what do you want ?
i want the golf cart .
no , it was a gift from arnold .
i' m kidding .
i can have anything ?
yeah .

i want my job back .
don' t do this  have a good junket .
keep me posted .
all right .
yes .
you get them back together , you can have your job .
where are we booked ?
four seasons .
no .
book us in the middle of nowhere , where they can' t escape .
we need a hotel like the one in the shining .
the new hyatt in nevada ?
it' s in the desert .
book it .
we have to keep the press entertained .
let the press think it' s about them , not the movie .
give them a lot to do : parties , hayrides , circle jerks .
help them forget they haven' t seen the movie .
what about gifts ?
the movie' s about a cop traveling in time , so i did a gun .
you' re giving press members a gun ?
it' s not real
we' il do a bag .
call the bag man .
diamond earrings , money clips , chocolate truffles , perfume .
i don' t want this to be awkward for you , but i' ve got work to do .
how will you get eddie and gwen there ?
i know somebody .
i love you .
i' d do anything for you .
you' re just asking an awful lot .
a junket with eddie isn' t gwen' s priority .
take the lilies out .
yes .
i understand .
excuse me .
could you please put that out ?
gwen would love this .
i can' t take unsolicited material .
just warning you it' il be a bit of a fight .
i' il do what i can .
god help us .
when we come back from the break , you know the scenario .
i' ve been here before .
look right at that camera .
talk right to the caller .
right down the tube .
okay , five seconds .
let' s go to the calls on larry king live .
you' re on the air with gwen harrison .
hi , larry .
gwen , hi .
i used to be a big fan ... ... but i' m sorry , i can' t get over what happened with you and eddie .
i can' t sleep at night .
how can you ?
well ....
you sleep next to a very handsome young spanish gentleman , don' t you ?
let' s go to our next call .
rock lsland , illinois , hello .
gwen , i saw yourlatest movie .
thank you .
i couldn' t sit through it . without eddie , it' s not the same .
this has to be hard .
your last two movies without eddie ... ... tanked at the box office .
they were big in europe and huge in japan , actually .
still , it must be tough .
two duds in a row ... ... lots of intrigue , whispers , talk .
what happens if this one tanks ?
i hate larry king .
why did i do his stupid show ?
just breathe .
i don' t want to breathe .
your last two movies tanked .
i wanted to choke him to death with those stupid suspenders .
everyone hates me .
that' s not true .
the lighting was great .
everybody said you looked great .
who ?
you looked great .
see ?
thanks .
as if she really knows .
water will make you feel better .
i only like the water with the electrolytes .
larry said you were amazing .
thank you .
i love larry .
let' s love him down to the dressing room .
black or white ?
white .
and those glasses !
who wears frames that big anymore ?
he looks like a bug .
i just want this week to be over .
why can' t the world accept that i don' t want to be with eddie ?
get a life !
i want this week to be over . ls it ?
almost .
push .
kiki !
i' m sorry .
i smell smoke . ls somebody smoking ?
i don' t know .
it' s probably larry .
how many heart attacks has he had ?
six ?
maybe seven ?
can we just go ?
i don' t want to be here anymore .
those are beautiful .
okay .
i got a call from lee today .
who ?

you got upset when letterman didn' t air your show due to the gulf war .
he was there with the english toffee .
i remember the toffee .
great toffee .
we' il get you some when you meet with him to talk about the junket .
oh , god .
do i have to ?
meet with him ?
yes , you have to .
it' s not fair .
all this pressure on me and none on eddie .
he' s probably having a ball .
this letter is a very important part of healing .
writing your mom gives you the opportunity to thank her ... ... or forgive her or ask her why she did what she did .
we don' t mail it .
but the act of putting it on paper frees you .
allows you to let go .
now , what did you say to your mother ?
fuck you .
okay .
we' il try the letter some other time .
are you comfortable speaking about gwen ?
think i should ?
there' s no " should .
think i can ?
what is " can " ?
all right .
there was this place in chinatown .
tiny little place .
they wouldn' t bother us there .
we' d get wonton soup and crumpled duck and sit there for hours , talking .
she took him there .
she took him to our crumpled duck .
i followed them and i saw him pouring the soup and smiling ....
it was a total accident .
she told the press i tried to kill her .
that' s crazy .
she loves to overreact .
we have a saying , edward .
what is that ?
bean salad ?
what does that mean ?
i don' t know what it means .
it' s very old .
i' m making progress .
i feel more secure .
a lot more secure .
do i seem more secure ?
you look great .
whatever they' re doing , it' s working .
your face has color .
i' m in love .
they say two weeks here changes your life .
when are two weeks up ?
six months ago .
but i' m getting close to something .
i can see that .
did you watch larry king last night ?
i was in the isolation tank .
the reason i bring it up is gwen was on .
she took kind of a beating .
she did , did she ?
you , young lady , are nobody without eddie !
nobody likes you !
never go anywhere without eddie .
you' re nothing .
you' re nothing !

i' m so sorry , larry .

i' m still getting treatment .
this is serious stuff .
my wellness guide won' t let me just go .

we' il miss you .
don' t forget to be grateful .
i' m grateful .
i' m grateful for the sun . for the stars in the sky

kiki , look at you .

and i lost a little weight .
i see that .
you look terrific .
sixty pounds !
that' s a backstreet boy .
right ?
are you here to talk to me ?
of course .
i' m sorry .
eddie' s not demented .
it was a one time , forgive and forget thing .
he tried to kill me .
am i the only one who remembers that ?
attempted murder doesn' t get attention anymore ?
he was just so in love with you that he flipped out .
you have this powerful effect on people .
that' s true .
you sticking up for him again ?
whose side am i on ?
gwen , your dog just swallowed your window washer .
puppy .
your puppy' s a raptor .
prozac time .
excuse me .
she' s on prozac ?
lf only .
the dog .
oh , the dog .
that' s not a bad thing .
hey , baby .
hi , honey .
here comes your sweaty big man .
you' re sweaty .
who is this ?
i' m lee , press agent for time over time .
i' m not gonna sweep her off her feet .
no , you' re too old .
hector , honey .

i' m sorry .
he' s spanish .
no problem .
i was spanish once myself .
oh , i need kisses .
oh , honey .
oh , there you go .
oh , yes .
oh , yes .
for why is he here now ?
he wants me to go to the junket for the movie .
we could do that .
when ?
we won' t take up any of your valuable time .
i' m not invited ?
it' s the studio' s decision .
what do i care about the studio ?
i don' t give a shit .
i go where gwen goes .
we' re a couple .
we' il go to the junket together .
studio .
you' re so beautiful .
i love you so much .
i wanna marry you and make something with our skins .
we' re not going .
eddie' il be there .
we won' t go because of him ?
listen .
we' re going to go ... ... and i' il personally protect you ... ... if that psycho asshole bastard tries to kill you again .
we' re not going .
don' t argue with me .
we' re going .
everybody wants me to go , but nobody cares what i want !
that' s not true .
nobody cares !
don' t you know the stress i have ?
everyone hates me .
everyone wants a piece of me .
my shrink' s out of town .
i wasn' t nominated for a golden globe this year !
leave me alone .
bastards .
are you pleased with yourself ?
i can' t even enjoy my shower now , mr. publicist piece of shit .
gwen is totally nuts .
cleared the room .
well done .
talk to your sister .
at least she pretends to listen to you .
where is she ?
grazing .
nazi bastard .
just kidding .
you need to go to this junket .
why not ?
i' m afraid .
of ... ?
that i' il see eddie and he' il be a mess .
i' il feel guilty .
and i' m tired of feeling guilty .
i know .
i' m always thinking about other people .
i know you are .
i hate being the only one who cares about others .
lf they see eddie down and sad , they' il pity him and blame me .
so what you' re worried about is you .
of course .
does everyone hate me , kiki ?
no one hates you .
yes , they do .
i was in that great store on melrose .
there was a baby in a stroller looking at me , and he was judging me .
the whole world is judging me for what i did to eddie .
look , i' il admit ... ... the miss adorable image has been called into question .
all the more reason to go .
smile nice with eddie for the weekend , win back audience goodwill .
you think it would help ?
i do .
i could give eddie the divorce papers .
that' s a plus .
you sure you' re ready to do that ?
i' m sure .
why are you still questioning me ?
it' s eddie .
he' d sing " yellow submarine " at the top of his lungs to make you laugh ... ... and save the mango in his fruit salad for you .
exactly .
eddie .
you' re just a romantic , kiki .
you know nothing about married life .
you got me there .
i won' t be able to get through this on my own .
can you help me ?
i' il help you .
these are new pants .
good dog .
get the paper .
come on .
come on .
please .
help .
don' t let me interrupt .
what happened ?
i' m packing her things because we' re going to a junket .
really ?
great !
you' re a great sister .
i' m a great assistant .
to the left .
these are herbal medications .
okay .
people wrote i was on zoloft , but this is holistic .
sure got a lot .
watch the road , please .
bobby ?
he wants you to pull over .
this is kishtonga root .
yeah , okay .
why are we stopping ?
i was told to .
so how you doing ?
fine .
why ?
i gotta hand it to you .
lf my lady left me for another guy , i' d swallow a gun .
i' d get drunk ... ... lay on the tracks and wait for a train .
could we please not talk about that ?
you know something ?
people say i look like you .
not that we look alike .
but i project you .
i project the essence of you , like a you ness .
can you put that partition up ?
yes , sir .
how you doing ?
how' s it going ?
i was just getting a pep talk from my driver .
i' m orchestrating the hotel arrival .
should you or gwen pull up first ?
where did you come from , man ?
here .
i' m riding with gwen .
gwen' s back there ?
yes .
so do you want to arrive first or second ?
second .
be right back .
he wants to go second .
let him .
he can go second .
great .
wait .
he should go first .
i don' t want to look like his opening act .
i want to go second .
she wants to go second .
second it is .
she wants to go second .
fine .
let her .
i don' t care .
from behind , she' il see the knife she stuck in my back .
thank you .
okay ?

we' re set .
great .
who cares ?
she doesn' t care .
yes , i do .
i' m going first .
i don' t care !
why is this an issue ?
i' m just trying
let' s go to the hotel !
you' re second .
i don' t care !
i don' t care !
i don' t care !
you' re going second .
you' re going second .
i don' t care .
okay , thank you .
that was easy .
why do we have to go second ?
drive the car !
i' m grateful for the sun .
i' m grateful for the moon .
i' m grateful for the cool ... ... cool night breeze .
it' s a happy night for eddie and gwen fans .
a year ago , america' s sweethearts went bust in dramatic fashion .
here they come now .
hi , gwen , you look wonderful tonight .
can i get a shot ?
look this way !
that' s it .
gwen , who' s a better lover ?
okay , right this way .
eddie , here we go .

i can' t remember .
that was so good .
that had to feel good .
it was good we went second .
everybody loved you .
what is this ?
serenity tea from the wellness center .
i don' t know what' s in it , but it gets me calm and focused .
i can' t do this !
i told you this was a mistake .
she' s very close , right ?

i feel her .

i sensed it .
she' s close .
the cottages are way back on the property .
it' s so shocking .
you' re with somebody .
you think you' il spend your life she has a cottage and i get a suite ?
she has an entourage .
me too !
you do ?
i' m a schizo .
i' m my own entourage .
let me move you .
no , it' s not important .
i' m grateful for this suite and minibar .
the cottages are probably small .
actually , they' re ... ... tiny .
small ?
it' s ridiculous .
good .
want to get room service ?
i' il take some herbs , numb out , have a shower and go to bed alone .
you' ve been great .
what did i do ?
showed up .
that' s enough .
rest , i don' t want you puffy .
jesus .
hey , steve .
what ?
some guy' s whacking it near cottage number 4 .
oh , that' s ....
that' s disgusting .
i don' t want to deal with this now .
every time i get this shift , there' s always some sicko .
i can' t catch a break around here .
sir , i' m sure things are different in l. a ... ... but in nevada , we prosecute public masturbation .

i was pulling out the prickers !
i' m trying to put out a fire .

oh , my god !
oh , my god .
thomas is in town fora pressjunket for the new eddie and gwen movie .

gwen , everybody does it .

i hope they' re runny enough .
and you !
son of a bitch !
here are your eggs !
there you go !
what' s wrong ?
a lot , actually .
i can' t believe it' s taken so long to figure out .
i' m going for a long walk to simmer down .
first , i' d like to cut through the shit .
he' s not technically dating because he' s technically hung up on you .
and you !
you moron !
she' s only here to salvage her precious career ... ... and serve you with divorce papers .
i' ve done all i can do .
i' m going for a walk .
leaving is just something i' ve really perfected , so ... ... once more , with feeling .
she was more fun when she was fat .
ls that true ?
what ?
about the papers .
yes , but now i don' t know .
seeing you , being in front of the press with you we have something .
maybe i' ve made a horrible , horrible mistake .
maybe i should give you the papers .
i don' t know .
you' re the devil .
i want to talk .
hold on a minute .
let go of me .
i want to talk .
i don' t !
why not ?
you' re an idiot .
i' m an idiot too !
ln that respect , we belong together .
it' s a complicated situation .
i' il un complicate it !
forget about what happened between us .
it' s not gonna work , all right ?
last night ?
last night was great .
but she calls you , and you can' t wait to get to her !
what is that ?
it won' t work .
you' il probably always think of her ... ... and i' il probably always wonder if you' re thinking of her .
i just
i need you to know one thing .
what ?
that woman that you saw by the pool
that woman you just have to spend the rest of your life with ....
that was me .
good morning .
morning .
so here' s the buffet .
what' s going on ?
nothing .
i' m great .

i have one theory .
i need an assistant .
lf i had one , she' d be outside milking a cow ... ... and i' d never run out of butter .
my butter has touched another food .
i need new butter .
anything you want .
that' s how it goes .
you know .
anything they want , right ?
she' s got a green dress .
looks like crap on her .
brings out the bags under her eyes .
she gave it to me .
it looks nice .
then she said she wanted it back .
she doesn' t want me to have it .
so you' re in love with eddie ?
wouldn' t that be stupid ?
i' ve done every one of their movies .
he never looks at her the way he looks at you .
lf you' re in love , just go for it .
the way you went for this breakfast .
not the way you went for the breakfast .
that' s
i think i' m gonna be sick .
can you just ....
i' il take all of this to go .
i' il need 30 bags and a forklift .
no laugh , no tip .

that they can relate to .

it came to me like a bus in the street .
or the woman who changes the flowers at our desert house .
i can' t talk about this film without weeping .
roll it .
thank you , hal .
have a great time , everybody !
sarah .
i' m ben . we must speak . who are you ?
that' s unimportant . what' s important now is yoursafety .
you' re in danger .
this is hard to say , so i' iljust say it .
i' m from the future .
oh , my god !
you look beautiful .
thank you .
come with me now .
now , sarah , please .
love is a bridge built between two people . we want what exists between them to be real .
my name is hal weidmann .
the film you' re about to see is time over time , oris it ?
the details are unimportant .
simplyput ... ... the script was shit .
i tossed it .
i let my camera capture real life .
just watch .
i filmed my actors without theirknowledge .
i let the camera run after takes .
i placed hidden cameras around .
and the end result is a story ... ... farmore involving than anything manufactured by actors and writers .
this is real life .
thejuice .
the stink .
the glory .
often , you wonder where the budget goes .
shut up !
it' s gonna be good .
i don' t mean to pressure you , but we' re 15 days over .
oh , no . what are we gonna do ?
i' m in the middle ofshooting .
it' s a sensitive time .
do me a favor .
go away .
please .
never visit my set again .
watch him take it ... ... up the gazoo .
you' re an idiot .
i told you we nevershould' ve hired him .
you' re so good in this .
cut .
hal , can i get like three minutes ?
three minutes .
gwen , can i talk to you ?
i' m working .

i think it' s very entertaining .
lee , get over here !
you stop this right now .
i' il sue the studio .
lower your voice .
shut up .
cut the film .
excuse me .
was that deserved ?
i think so .
you' ve ruined me .
you' ve ruined my career .
look at the screen .
don' t you realize what that is ?
that' s reinvention .
that' s birth .
that' s life itself .
can' t you smell the life ?
pretty soon you' il smell lra stern , my attorney !
thank you , hal .
wacko .
the film' s new direction caught some of us a little bit off guard .
i am shocked .
i' m outraged .
there are textures !
can i say something , please ?
what was said about my penis is completely false .
i' m extremely well hung .
i' il submit to an inspection .
i knew this film would be misunderstood .
kubrick was misunderstood .
godard .
i' il kick your ass !
understand that !
who are you ?
who am l ?
i' m your ass kicker !
can i defend my dad ?
no .
who' s her dad ?
hal .
no , you cannot !
let me defend hector .
we had sex .
his penis is bigger than a roll of quarters .
you slept with her ?
no .
you slept with her ?
i swear she' s lying .
the part about my penis is true .
it' s bigger than coins .
there will be a lawsuit . lnvasion of privacy , damage to my career !
yes , yes , i know .
congratulations .
it' s my most honest work .
i' il work with you .
i got a script .
you' re great .
i' il send it .
i have an announcement to make .
i' d like to thank you all .
i' m so happy you' re here and all our friends in the press ... ... who' ve been so supportive this last year .
i' m so happy to say ... ... that eddie and i are getting back together .
so thank you all so much .
what is this bullshit now ?
be quiet .
this is bullshit .
bullshit !
today , eddie came to the cottage .
we had breakfast and a heartfelt talk , didn' t we , honey ?
i' ve wanted to get back together with gwen ... ... ever since we weren' t together anymore .
i' ve obsessed about it .
how sweet .
now that it' s happened , i must say ... ... l' m amazed and grateful .
and i agree with hector that it' s bullshit .
thank you very much !
we talked about this .
no .
we did .
don' t you love me ?
we did not .
i love the bright , sexy woman up on screen .
he loves me .
the movie girl .
that' s not you .
you' re good at pretending to be real .
i think i' m with the real you , but i' m not .
i' m with the real you , not the movie you .
i don' t want that .
why ?
i just explained it .
you did ?
i don' t want to talk .
not in front of these  why not ?
what could i have to say to you that i don' t have to say ... ... in front of 300 international press members .
i' il tell you why .
i' m in love with your sister .
ls this some kind ofjoke ?
kiki , could you get over here ?
why her ?
oh , why not ?
ls it so unbelievable that a man could love me ?
not now .
now is the time .
you just wait for me !
can i say something ?
yes .
no !
listen .
okay , one nut at a time .
you' re my sister .
i love you .
you should know nothing happened between me and eddie until last night .
i feel much better about you stealing my husband .
ex husband .
i didn' t steal anything .
you' re the one shacked up for the past year with ricky ricardo .
look , i am just tired of making excuses .
i am done picking up dirty clothes .
i am done pretending ... ... that your life is my whole life .
i' m just ....
i' m done .
so what you' re really worried about is you , right ?
well , i guess you' re fired .
honey .
you know all i care about is your happiness .
that' s sweet
so don' t worry about me .
i' il be fine .
you' re unbelievable .
shut up .
next ?
what can i do for you ?
i shouldn' t have said that in front of everybody , but
i' ve been searching for clarity .
all of a sudden i am so clear , it' s ridiculous .
i want to be with you .
when did you decide this ?
the moment i thought i' d lost you .
damn it .
what ?
that was ....
that was good .
no .
no , this is crazy .
eddie , this isn' t gonna work .
listen to me .
i' m grateful for you .
ln all the world , the thing i' m most grateful for is you .
lf that' s a line from your movie  that one' s mine .
what do we do now ?
traditionally ... ... we kiss .
give her some room .
thank you .
step back , please .
easy , easy .
i' m on pain medication ... ... that makes me say things i' d never say otherwise .
to set the record perfectly straight ... ... eddie and i never had any plans to reconcile .
and ?
and hector is very well endowed .
almost too well endowed .
i' ve had complaints .
literally .
what are you doing ?
packing .
let me help you with that .
that' s okay .
that' s no , really folding !
let somebody help you for once .
there you are .
that was unbelievable .
like a movie with a stage show .
lf you' d tour with the film , we' d be rich .
and your sister is unbelievable .
the entire country has voted her off the island but , no !
she' s back !
i' ve never seen anything like it .
they like the film !
they call it the blairbitch projecf ! .
but the best news is you two .
want a drink ?
we' re on our way out .
where ?
we don' t know .
once in a while , good things happen .
i' il see you .
there' s a car , so you can dodge the press .
but i' il need you !
we got work to do !
this one will work !
hi .
can i explain why i didn' t call ?
