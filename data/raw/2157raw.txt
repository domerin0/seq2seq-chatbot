brought to you by nbc , the national broadcasting company ... broadcasting nationally coast to coast ... from new york to los angeles ... from seattle to st petersburg ... via a vast network of affiliates crisscrossing the country .
coming up next , twenty one ... starring master of ceremonies jack barry !
two players racing to score twenty one points ... each in a soundproof television studio , not knowing the other one' s score ...
with $500 ...
damn it ! riding on each point ... as they both play twenty one !
and here' s your host , jack barry !
good evening .
i' m jack barry .
due to a series of ties , herbert stempel , our 29 year old ex g. i. college student ... must play at $3, 000 a point ... which means that in a few brief minutes , he can either win ... as much as $ 1 00, 000 , the most money won on television to date ... or lose everything he' s won in the last eight weeks .
you nervous ?
as our regular viewers already know , our rules are similar ...
to the card game , twenty one .
it' s only money .
isolated in their soundproof studios ... neither player is aware of the other' s score .
i' ve been assured by our friends at the encyclopedia ... that they' ve concocted some real brain breakers this week ... so we' il find out in the next 30 minutes if the unstumpable ...
herbert stempel can be stumped .
could i have the questions , please ?
thank you , gentlemen .
remember , the questions on twenty one are secured ... each week in a manhattan bank vault till just before show time .
so right now , let' s meet herbert stempel and his challenger ... as geritol , america' s # 1 tonic , presents twenty one .
welcome back to the show , gentlemen .
mr peloubet , a very cordial welcome to you , sir .
how are you , herb ?
how' s everything in queens ?
fine , mr barry .
it' s a nervous strain on the family , i bet .
how' s your wife holding out ?
she' s fine , thank you .
thank you , mr barry , for asking .
as you know , herb , the questions are graded for difficulty by the encyclopedia britannica .
i might add that my wife no longer suffers from tired blood ... now that i' ve got her on geritol .
that' s fine .
graded on a scale from one
i personally vouch that it' s a fine product .
i' m sure our sponsor will be pleased to know that , herb .
now , to get on with the show
i' d like to take this opportunity to thank geritol ... for giving a poor ex g. i. this amazing opportunity ... to realize his dream of a college education .
now there' s a face for radio .
dick peloubet back again from sunny miami , florida , and herb stempel .
yeah .
this stempel is giving me a headache .
well , he sells geritol .
have you seen the ratings ?
well , they' ve evened out .
i don' t think he works any more .
stempel is an underdog .
you know , people root for that .
it' s a new york thing .
queens is not new york .
let' s play twenty one .
mr kintner' s office , please .
office of the president .
could you hold , please ?
mr kintner' s office .
once inside the isolation booth , neither player can see the other , nor can they hear anything until i turn their studios on , which i' m gonna do right now .
all right , gentlemen .
he' s not hurting sales , is he ?
he just doesn' t think he works .
why ?
look , i don' t know .
i guess the sponsor wants a guy on twenty one ... who looks like he could get a table at twenty one .
you just tell him i said stempel has an everyman quality .
you know that whole american dream thing ?
you , too , can be rich ?
if the ratings stay high .
very funny .
i' m just passing it along , sir .
every schoolboy knows about the midnight ride of paul revere .
for eleven points , how many lanterns were hung in the old north church ?
who rode with paul revere ?
who lent him his horse ?
was it a mare or a stallion ?
and what was the horse' s name ?
stand by, joe , on herbie . kill the air .
tommy , air off .
uh
a little tighter .
tell him to put the sign up .
control booth .
uh , yeah .
hold on , sir .
dan , it' s for you .
it' s kintner .
would you mind , mr barry ?
could i take the third part last ?
that' s fine .
the code was , uh , " one if by land , two if by sea .
therefore , it would have to be two lanterns in the old north church .
that' s right .
and , the second part .
who rode with him ?
dawes and prescott .
dawes and prescott .
what these books have conclusively proven ... is that the difference between men and women is exactly 38 pages .
can i quote you , mark ?
not before i quote me .
his own quotes are his greatest pleasure .
did you hear the market dropped 30 points today ?
there' s a rumour eisenhower died .

have you ever watched one of these , uh , quiz shows , dad ?
the $64, 000 question or , or twenty one ?

okay , herb .
finally ... name the man who loaned paul revere his horse ... for that fateful midnight ride .
who loaned him the horse ?
okay , herb ...
i' m afraid i' m going to have to ask for your answer .
yes , mr barry .
look , just give him what he wants .
i don' t want to talk to these agency guys .
so , what do you want me to do , mr kintner ?
you' re a producer , dan .

but of course , as you know , all the great physicists were great before the age of 25 .
it just wasn' t in the cards .
so , i went to paris and wrote my novel about a patricide .

it' s about a boy in the bronx
mr enright will see you now .
have a seat , herb .
thanks for comin ' up .
i feel we have some unfinished business we need to hash out .
i have some unfinished business with you , too .
this whole thing with the grand jury and the things you said , well , they hurt me .
i can' t tell you how well , they hurt me deeply .
i told the truth .
there you go again .
you promised me , dan .
y you promised that you' d help me out .
don' t you think that i wanna help you more than i already have ?
but the point is , you' ve made it impossible .
look , you want me to , uh ...
i want you ...
apologize ? to sign this statement .
i apologize .
what kind of statement ?
it clears me and the show of any wrongdoing .
what about the panel show ?
see ?
that' s a perfect example .
i told you i' d do what i could , and i did .
i put your name on a list .
you put me on a list ?
that' s it ?
nbc owns our company .
everything goes through them .
nbc bought your company for two million bucks !
what about me ?
people , people watched me on that show .
look .
look .
look at this .
oh , herb , don' t start  " he has become a friend in over 50 million homes ... whose weekly visits the whole family eagerly anticipates .
i was a friend , too , in 50 million homes .
look , what can i tell you , herb ?
life is unfair .
life is unfair to me .
life' s not unfair to charles van doren .
remember how he snubbed me after the show ?
there' il be other shows .
what other shows ?
i need the money , dan .
wha what ?
how could you need the money ?
it' s gone .
i mean , it' s invested .
it' s tied up .
i just
well , can' t you talk to your broker ?
he' s not a broker .
he' s more of a bookmaker .
it' s seed money .
he' s setting up in florida right now .
he says it' s the next growth area .
you gave your money to a bookie who skipped town ?
i , i want what i have coming , dan .
i have to get back on television .
herb , i' m gonna i' m  show me this list .
where' s this list ?
i submitted a list of 45 names .
they rejected three .
you were one of them .
that big uncircumcised putz is on the cover of time magazine ... and i can' t even make the top 42 for a panel show ?
well
look , maybe , maybe , i maybe , you could warm up the audience before the show .
i c i could throw you 50 bucks a week .
50 bucks a week ?
that should be me on the cover of time !
shit , herb ! just sign this statement .
charles van doren !
he wouldn' t know the answer to a doorbell if you didn' t give it to him .
sign this statement , and get on with your life !
sign the statement , herb .
sign the statement .
who cares if it' s true ?
i' m giving you a chance .
you promised me !
you get me that panel show , or i' m gonna bring you down with me , ya lousy , lyin ' prick !
you and charles van fuckin ' doren .

i' il just tell everyone that it' s a fraud .
that' il warm ' em up .
the fix is in this week on twenty one !
when' s my next appointment ?
the cover of time ?
his mug shot will be on the cover of time !
what the hell happened ?
oy .
why am i the only one working this morning ?
what have you got over there , mooie ?
demonstrators stoned vice president nixon' s ... motorcade as it proceeded through caracas .
gee , dick , what' s the new york times say ?
same thing ?
generally .
most people who live in washington ...
settle for the washington papers .
yeah , well , the times is the paper of record .
ahh !
ooh !
dick hopes someday to be confused with an important person .
although the crowd was cordoned off at a distance of a hundred yards ... an unidentified venezuelan struck nixon in the head with a thrown onion .
wow .
the senators should sign this guy .
did you guys know there was a grand jury in new york on the quiz shows ?
jim lemon can' t even hit the cutoff man .
this guy throws a 300 foot strike with an onion .
have they come up with anything ?
they sealed the presentment .
that' s a no .
uh , why do you say that ?
a presentment' s a statement of findings .
if there were anything in it , they' d want to release it to the public , right ?
if the purpose is to make findings public , then why keep it a secret ?
why seal the presentment ?
it' s illogical .
it' s a local matter .
it' s television .
whoa !
tv .
it' s under our jurisdiction , right ?
i mean , we have oversight over all the agencies .
it includes the fcc .
you' re gonna investigate a dead investigation ?
we' re gonna put television on trial .
television !
everybody in the country' il know about it .
what do you have ?
there' s somethin ' there .
mr chairman , i' il find it .
the networks ?
the pharmaceutical industry ?
cosmetics ?
that' s big game , son .
you don' t go huntin ' in your underwear .
sir , i smell somethin ' .
at least give me a chance to see what i can dig up .
let me go up to new york .
this isn' t some junket for you to stay in a hotel and see a broadway show , you know .
i' m givin ' you exactly one week to find something .
you got that ?
unseal a presentment .
i don' t know .
i don' t know how you go about that .
i' ve never
oh , here you go .
look at this .
hasn' t been a presentment under seal in the state of new york since 1 869 .
that explains it .
1 869 ?
mmm .
counsellor , i' ve reviewed in detail the material submitted in your request .
a man' s reputation is coin of the realm to him .
i sealed this presentment to protect the reputations of those unfairly implicated ... by a certain mentally unstable finger pointer .
that interest , along with important issues of federalism ... dictate that i reject your committee' s request at this time .
mr enright' s office .
mr enright ?
it' s judge schweitzer .
yes ?
hi .
mrs mitchell ?
uh huh .
my name is richard goodwin .
i' m with the congressional subcommittee on legislative oversight .
uh , we' ve been investigating the quiz shows recently , and
um , i was wondering if i could ask you a quick question .

hmm .
so that' s , uh , $ 1 0, 000 a week .
that' s right .
although last week , i know you were preempted for another programme .
well , that' s the problem with television .
the pay' s good , but it' s not that steady .
don' t remind me .
i' m up for renewal .
so tell us about the book you' re working on .
well , it' s called lincoln' s commando ... and i hope people will find it as interesting as i do .

he taught me my backhand .
i' m with the house subcommittee on legislative oversight .
i' ve been swarmed by stockbrokers lately .

they always follow a jew with a gentile .
and the gentile wins more money .

herb , you' re saying this whole grand jury thing was because of you .
you know what you have to do ?
you have to nail van doren .

let me ask you something .
do you have any corroborative evidence to what you' re saying ?

don' t make necessarily the mistakes that i might have made in life .
think about your career .

twenty years .
auntie rita had an affair with wendell willkie .

three score rings around this tree .
once green ; now bare .
once lush ; now sere .

and doddering . assuage my woes
a termite nibbles at my toes .

i suppose that makes me king baudouin .
no .
next birthday , you all get a dirty limerick .
i certainly hope so !
so , how' s it feel , charlie ?
well , i can' t even eat dinner in a restaurant any more .
and people follow me inside to discover what kind of brain food i eat .
in my day , it was flagpole sitting and swallowing goldfish .
last week alone , i had 1 1 proposals of marriage .
perhaps you should accept one of them .
to think that they unleash you on those impressionable young minds .
well , why not ?
he' s 33 years old . jesus christ had a girlfriend at 33 years old .
look how that turned out .
and he shared an office with his father .
i' m sure they' re all very nice girls .
in that case , perhaps i should appear on a quiz show .
oh , the money , meanwhile , no one knows what to do with it ... though every stockbroker in new york seems eager to try .
why don' t you just put it in the bank ?
what i' ve always done with my prize money .
no , it' s just you don' t understand , dad .
it' s , uh
there are all sorts of tax implications .
you think i can' t understand the concept of taxes ?
at this level , it' s a bit more complicated .
and at my level ?
i never thought of myself having a level , charlie .
what level might that be ?
i mean , it' s not as if the money fell into my lap .
i worked for it .
w work ?
ah , ho , ho , ho .
millions of people watch the game shows , dad .
then i suppose we' ve become a nation of proctors .
mark .

' course we don' t have a television .
why on earth would we need a television ?
how much money is it again ?
wha what ?
they don' t have a television .
you haven' t seen the show ?
we were supposed to watch it the other night at thurber' s
even thurber has a television , and he' s blind .
what ?
how , how much is it now , charlie ? $ 1 22, 000 .
what ?
oh !
i never !
she heard that all right .
well .
some rise by sin and some by virtue fall .
measure for measure .
to do a great right , do a little wrong .
merchant of venice .
it' s this game our family plays .
oh , what men dare do !
what men may do !
what men daily do , not knowing what they do .
much ado about nothing .
things without remedy should be without regard ; what' s done is done .
things without all remedy .
macbeth .
how ill white hairs become a fool and jester .
now , professor , open your presents .
yes !
well , what have we here ?
aftershave .
