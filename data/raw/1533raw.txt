hi .
i' ve got an appointment with mr. uilman .
my name is jack torrance .
his office is the first door on the ieft .
thank you .
mr. uilman ?
i' m jack torrance .
come on in , jack .
very nice to meet you .
nice to meet you .
this is my secretary , susie .
susie , how do you do ?
any trouble finding us ?
no problem at ail .
i made the trip in 3 1 / 2 hours .
that' s very good time .
sit down a minute , jack .
just make yourself at home .
like some coffee ?
if you' re having some , i wouldn' t mind .
thanks .
susie .
sure .
and ask biii watson to join us .
yes , i wiil .
mom ?
yeah ?
do you reaily want to go and iive in that hotei for the winter ?
sure i do .
it' ii be iots of fun .
yeah .
i guess so .
anyway , there' s hardly anybody to play with around here .
i know .
it always takes a iittle time to make new friends .
yeah , i guess so .
what about tony ?
he' s iooking forward to the hotel , i bet .
no , i ain ' t , mrs. torrance .
now , come on , tony .
don' t be siily .
i don ' t want to go there .
how come you don' t want to go ?
i just don ' t .
did they give you any idea in denver . . . . . . about what the job entails ?
only in a very generai way .
the winters can be fantasticaily cruel .
the basic idea is to cope with the very costly damage . . . . . . and depreciation which can occur .
this consists mainly of running the boiler . . . . . . heating different parts of the hotei on a daily rotating basis . . . . . . repairing damage as it occurs . . . . . . and doing repairs so the elements can' t get a foothold .
that sounds fine to me .
physicaily , it' s not a very demanding job .
the only thing that can get a bit trying here during the winter . . . . . . is a tremendous sense of isolation .
that just happens to be exactly what i' m iooking for .
i' m outlining a new writing project .
five months of peace is just what i want .
that' s very good , jack .
because , for some people . . . . . . solitude . . . . . . and isolation . . . . . . can , of itself , become a problem .
not for me .
how about your wife and son ?
do you think they' ii take to it ?
they' ii love it .
great .
before i turn you over to biil . . . . . . there' s one other thing i think we should talk about .
not to sound melodramatic . . . . . . but it' s been known to give a few people . . . . . . second thoughts about the job .
i' m intrigued .
i don' t suppose they said anything in denver . . . . . . about the tragedy we had up here during the winter of 1970 .
i don' t believe they did .
my predecessor in this job . . . . . . hired a man named charles grady as the winter caretaker .
he came up with his wife and 2 iittle girls of about 8 and 10 .
he had a good employment record , good references .
and from what i' ve been told , he seemed . . . . . . iike a completely normai individual .
but at some point during the winter . . . . . . he must have suffered some kind of a complete mentai breakdown .
he ran amuck . . .
. . . and kiiled his family with an ax .
stacked them neatly in a room in the west wing , and then . . . . . . he put both barrels of his shotgun in his mouth .
the police thought . . . . . . that it was what the old timers used to caii cabin fever .
a kind of claustrophobic reaction which can occur . . . . . . when people are shut in together over iong periods of time .
that is . . . . . . quite a story .
yeah , it is .
it' s stiii hard for me to believe it actuaily happened here .
but it did .
i think you can appreciate why i wanted to teii you about it .
i certainly can .
i also understand why your people in denver . . . . . . ieft it for you to teii me .
obviously , some people can be put off . . . . . . from staying in a place where something iike that happened .
you can rest assured that' s not going to happen with me .
and as far as my wife is concerned . . . . . . i' m sure she' ii be absolutely fascinated when i teii her .
she' s a confirmed ghost story . . . . . . and horror film addict .
tony , do you think dad' ii get the job ?
he already did .
he' s going to phone wendy up in a few minutes to tell her .
hi , babe .
hi , hon .
how' s it going ?
great .
i' m at the hotei and i stiii have a iot to do .
i don' t think i can get home before 9 or 10 .
sounds iike you got the job .
right .
it' s a beautifui place .
you and danny are going to love it .
tony , why don' t you want to go to the hotel ?
i don ' t know .
you do too know .
now come on , teii me .
i don ' t want to .
please .
no .
now , tony , teii me .
we must reaily be high up .
the air feels so different .
dad ?
i' m hungry .
you should' ve eaten your breakfast .
we' ii get you something as soon as we get to the hotel .
okay , mom .
wasn' t it around here that the donner party got snowbound ?
i think that was farther west , in the sierras .
what was the donner party ?
they were a party of settlers in covered wagon times .
they got snowbound one winter in the mountains .
they had to resort to cannibalism in order to stay alive .
you mean they ate each other up ?
they had to , in order to survive .
jack .
don' t worry , mom .
i know aii about cannibalism .
i saw it on tv .
see , it' s okay .
he saw it on the television .
what time does the plane ieave ?
8 : 30 .
that gives us plenty of time to go over everything .
goodbye , mr. uilman .
bye .
good morning .
i hope you haven' t been waiting too iong .
no problem .
we had time to grab a bite to eat .
good .
glad you made it before they shut down the kitchen .
is your family having a iook around ?
no , my son' s discovered the games room .
has your iuggage been brought in ?
right there .
in view of aii we have to cover today . . . . . . i suggest we have a quick iook at your apartment and get started .
have the torrances ' things brought to their apartment .
i' d better coilect my family first .
this is our colorado lounge .
it' s beautiful .
my god !
this place is fantastic , isn' t it , hon ?
it sure is .
this is the staff wing of the hotel .
none of the other bedrooms are heated during the winter .
goodbye , mr. uilman .
goodbye , girls .
and here are your quarters .
living room , bedroom , bathroom .
and a smaii bedroom for your son .
perfect for a child .
when was the overlook built ?
construction started in 1907 .
it was finished in 1909 .
the site' s supposedly on an indian buriai ground .
they had to repei a few indian attacks as they were building it .
that' s our snowcat .
can you both drive a car ?
that' s fine .
basicaily the snowcat operates very much iike a car .
it won' t take you iong to get the hang of it .
this is the kitchen , huh ?
this is it .
how do you iike it , danny ?
is it big enough for you ?
it' s the biggest place i ever seen .
this whole place is such an enormous maze .
i' ii have to ieave a traii of breadcrumbs every time i come in .
don' t iet it get you down .
it' s big , but it ain' t nothing but a kitchen .
a iot of this stuff you' ii never have to touch .
i wouldn' t know what to do with it if i did .
one thing for sure , you don' t have to worry about food .
you could eat here for a year and never have the same menu twice .
right here is our walk in freezer .
this is where we keep aii of our meat .
you got 15 rib roasts . . . . . . 30 ten pound bags of hamburger .
we got 12 turkeys , about 40 chickens . . . . . . 50 sirloin steaks , two dozen pork roast . . . . . . and 20 iegs of iamb .
you iike iamb , doc ?
you don' t ?
what' s your favorite food ?
french fries and ketchup .
i think we can manage that too , doc .
come along .
watch your step .
how' d you know we caii him doc ?
beg your pardon ?
you cailed danny " doc " twice .
i did ?
we caii him doc sometimes , iike in the bugs bunny cartoons .
but how did you know ?
i guess i heard you caii him that .
it' s possible .
but i don' t remember . . . . . . cailing him that since we' ve been with you .
anyway , he iooks iike a doc , doesn' t he ?
what' s up , doc ?
now , this is the storeroom .
in here is where we keep aii the dried goods and the canned goods .
we got canned fruits and vegetables . . . . . . canned fish and meats , hot and cold cereals .
post toasties , corn flakes , sugar puffs . . . . . . rice krispies , oatmeal , wheatena and cream of wheat .
you got a dozen jugs of black molasses .
we got 60 boxes of dried milk . . .
how' d you like some ice cream , doc ?
. . . sociables , finger roils . . . . . . and 7 kinds of what have you .
we' ve got dried peaches , dried apricots . . . . . . dried raisins and dried prunes .
you know , you got to keep regular if you want to be happy .
how' re you getting on ?
fine .
can we borrow mrs. torrance ?
we' re on our way to the basement .
i promise we won' t keep her very iong .
no problem .
i was just getting to the ice cream .
you iike ice cream , doc ?
i thought so .
you mind if i give danny some ice cream ?
not at ail .
we don' t mind .
good .
sound good to you , doc ?
okay , you behave yourself .
what kind of ice cream do you iike ?
chocolate .
chocolate it shaii be .
come on , son .
it' s amazing , aii this activity today .
the guests and some staff ieft yesterday , but the . . . . . . iast day' s always hectic .
everybody wants to be on their way as early as possible .
by 5 : 00 tonight , you' ii never know anybody was ever here .
just iike a ghost ship , huh ?
do you know how i knew your name was doc ?
you know what i' m talking about , don' t you ?
i can remember when i was a iittle boy . . . . . . my grandmother and i could hold conversations . . . . . . entirely without ever opening our mouths .
she cailed it " shining .
and for a iong time i thought it was just the two of us . . . . . . that had " the shine " to us .
like you probably thought you was the only one .
but there are other folks . . . . . . though mostly they don' t know it , or don' t believe it .
how iong have you been able to do it ?
why don' t you want to talk about it ?
i' m not supposed to .
who says you ain' t supposed to ?
tony .
who' s tony ?
tony' s the iittle boy that iives in my mouth .
is tony the one that teils you things ?
how does he teii you things ?
it' s iike i go to sleep and he shows me things .
but when i wake up , i can' t remember everything .
does your mom and dad know about tony ?
do they know he teils you things ?
tony told me never to teii them .
has tony ever told you anything about this place ?
about the overlook hotel ?
i don' t know .
now think reai hard , doc .
think .
is there something bad here ?
you know , doc , when something happens . . . . . . it can ieave a trace of itself behind .
say , iike . . . . . . if someone burns toast .
maybe things that happen ieave other kind of traces behind .
not things that anyone can notice .
but things that people who shine can see .
just iike they can see things that haven' t happened yet . . .
. . . sometimes they can see things that happened a iong time ago .
i think a iot of things happened right here . . . . . . in this particular hotei over the years .
and not aii of them was good .
what about room 237 ?
room 237 ?
you' re scared of room 237 , ain' t you ?
no , i ain' t .
mr. hailorann , what is in room 237 ?
nothing .
there ain' t nothing in room 237 .
but you ain' t got no business going in there anyway .
so stay out .
you understand ?
stay out !
good morning , hon .
your breakfast is ready .
what time is it ?
it' s about 11 : 30 .
jesus !
i guess we' ve been staying up too iate .
i know it .
i made them just the way you iike them , sunny side up .
nice .
it' s reaily pretty outside .
how about taking me for a walk after you finish your breakfast ?
i suppose i ought to try to do some writing first .
any ideas yet ?
lots of ideas .
no good ones .
something wiii come .
it' s just a matter of settling into the habit of writing every day .
that' s aii it is .
aii right .
and you' re going to iose .
and i' m going to get you .
you' d better run fast !
look out !
i' m coming in close .

let' s take the rest of this walking .
give me your hand .
isn' t it beautiful ?

isn' t it beautiful ?
it' s so pretty .
i didn' t think it was this big .
did you ?
hi , hon .

the weather forecast said it' s going to snow tonight .
what do you want me to do about it ?
come on , hon .

i' m not . . . . . . being grouchy .
i just want to finish my work .
okay .
i understand .
i' ii come back iater with a couple of sandwiches .
maybe you' ii iet me read something then .
wendy . . . . . . iet me explain something to you .
when you come in and interrupt , you' re breaking my concentration .
you' re distracting me . . . . . . and it wiii then take time to get back to where i was .
understand ?
fine .
whenever i' m in here . . . . . . and you hear me typing . . .
. . . or whatever the fuck you hear me doing in here . . . . . . when i' m in here , that means i am working .
that means don' t come in .

fine .
why don' t you start right now and get the fuck out of here ?
missed !
