what are you doing here ?
you should have stayed home with your wife .
why did you come here ?
we can handle this .
you know me when duty calls count me in .
nobody moves !
this is the police .

put your hands up .
turn around .
you have the right to remain silence .
anything you say ...

don' t mind me go after him .
it' s dark and besides he' s already gone .
sir , your wife' s in the hospital .

congratulations .
it' s a boy .

it' s ok !
we can' t put perfecto rialino with other kids .
mrs. compiones , this is only a public elementary school !
and our teacher are not trained to teach disabled kids like your son .
ma' am my son is not disabled .
you have to face it .
autism is a form of disability .
i' m sorry for the term .
but you have to admit that your son is not normal .
autism is only a state of the mind .
he has talents and you just have to be patient with him .
there is a special school in manila that teaches special kids like your son .
it is very expensive to send him there .
we don' t have the money for that .
i' m begging you .
let him finish this school year .
his advisers can' t give him instructions anymore .
when he gets mad , he hurt his classmates .
we can' t handle him anymore .
i' il watch him everyday in school .
if you just allow me .
but flor ...
ma' am bullet needs your help .
how can he learn things about life ?
if we don' t include him with other normal kids .
i' m sorry .
i really can' t help you .
good day .
bullet let' s go .
you' re the best
no one can beat me .
you better practice some more .
hey , look it' s bullet .
you should beat him .

he' s nothing .
he can' t beat me .
you can call anyone if you like .
you' re such a braggart !
bullet , come , let' s go play .
mom , can i go play ?
i don' t have school tomorrow .
you can play but go home early .
yes , mom .
let' s go .

he' s such an airhead .
here , use this .
bullet is so good .
bullet , you won !
you' re the best !
this is two
two plus three ... equals five ...
bullet , i' il cook you fired chicken .
if you can count this .
you' il cook fried chicken if i counted the drawings ?
yes , but first count the drawings .
ok , mom .
this is two ... one ... two .
this is three .
once upon a time there was a great and brave warrior .
he was a giant .
when he saw young david he insulted and asked him .
do you think you can beat me with just a spear ?
come here and i' il feed you to the birds and animals .
david answered i may only have my spear .
but i' il beat you in the name of the lord yahweh the god of israel .
with his powers i' il beat you .
he brought the giant' s head to jerusalem .
bullet wake up .

my son , come with me .
i have something to show you .
i told you ...
i told you .
stop talking to yourself .
no one is talking with you .
bullet .
stop it .
yes , dad .
i still have the touch .
check how many bulls eye i' ve made .
mayor , you' ve hit nothing .
damn you !
do you want me to shoot you ?
mayor , you really didn' t hit anything .
you go take a look .
i think he' s blind .
mayor !
pal !
how' s the practice ?
well , i told them to check how many bulls eye that i' ve hit .
he really didn' t hit anything .
there' s really nothing .
i think there' s something wrong with this gun .
he should just use a blowgun .
he should just use a slingshot .
i' ve used that last night mayor .
it' s a good gun .
damn you !
just remember this !
don' t talk unless i ask you to .
pal , mayor , about the thing that we' ve talked ...
let' s try my godson .
bullet , show him what you' ve got .
of course .
show me what you' ve got .
show me .
ok .
whoa !
watch it !
bullet .
bullet .
what have i told you ?
you know i always remind him about how to use a gun .
i noticed that .
i always remind him .
bullet , go on .
what ?
what will i shoot ?
that ... that one .
hit is in between the eyes .
right in between .
ouch !
ouch !
bullet !
it' s too loud !
you almost hit my shoes .
i' m sorry .
you know that he' s ...
my ears hurt .
give me that .
my ears hurt .
do it again .
don' t be afraid .
don' t be afraid .
go on .
you hear him ?
don' t be afraid .
wait , you know him his ears are sensitive .
he freaks out when he hears loud noise .
bullet , hit it here .
hit it in between the eyes .
here , here .
what ?
hit it right here .
wait ... here , wear this .
you should hit it in the middle .
where ?
here ?
yes .
yes , godfather .
you can do it .
you can do it .
yeh !!
you' re the best , bullet .
he' s good .
we can use his talent .
go on , do it again .
hit it again in the middle .
i will .
always hit it there .
it looks like he just got lucky .
i thought he was really good .
he just got lucky .
wait , i have a feeling .
come here .
hey , wait !
i' d better take this .
i don' t trust you .
my guess is right .
all his shot hit the same target .
his talent is extra ordinary .
we can make use of him with his talent .
sure , but i must teach him first how to use a gun properly .
look at you .
up to now i still can' t believe that you' re the town' s mayor .
just wait when i become the president of our country .
that' s what i' m telling you .
you' re full of foolishness .
what foolishness ?
remember when we' re still in the force ?
i don' t remember you do anything good .
all you do is fooling around .
look who' s talking .
it is as if you are telling the truth .
if someone hears you .
they' il think what you' re saying is true .
do you want me to name it one by one ?
name what ?
remember when you eloped with maring ?
that' s not maring .
it' s clara .
that' s enough !
i came here because of this .
here .
this is a huge competition in manila .
the prize is big money .
flor will not agree with this .
i don' t agree in what you' re saying .
your son' s talent is extra ordinary .
extra ordinary ?
what are you thinking about ?
you should think about our son' s safety .
teaching your son how to use a gun ?
you know that he' s a ...
he' s a what ?
flor , his talent is not ordinary .
i don' t agree in what you are saying .
he' s our son a son of a policeman .
it' s just right for him to know how to protect himself and others as well .
what if something goes wrong ?
if guns are used in the wrong way that' s the time when people are in danger .
you' re just using your son to fulfill your own dreams .
flor , don' t forget he' s a campiones .
i' il prove to them that i' m not a failure .
our son will give honor to our name .
if he wins the crown .
bullet don' t !
ok .
i allowed you to join the contest .
only because i know that sports is good for you .
and also that' s what your father dreams .
for you to win the crown and give honor to our town .
but remember this .
never use the gun to kill people .
do you understand ?
yes , mom .
i love you so much !
i love you so much !
i love you too , mom .
i' m hungry now .
we' il eat then .
always be a good boy .
flor that' s enough , we' il miss the bus .
pal !
pal !
i just want to see bullet before he leaves .
to wish you good luck
i' il drive you to the bus station .

bullet !
always remember to say your prayers .
don' t forget to pray .
bullet , good luck !
peping give my regards to elly .
don' t forget to pray .
dad , why is there a tv inside the bus ?
only houses should have tv .
why is there a tv inside the bus ?
bullet , you know ...
it' s for the passengers not to get bored during the trip .
that' s is why .
bullet , my son .
always remember everything what
i' ve taught you about holding a gun when you are in the competition .
i will .
so you won' t get disqualified .
do you understand me ?
yes , daddy .
dad what does it mean ,
you have the right to remain silent " ?
it' s in the law .
that an arrested person should know his rights .
cops like me should not just shoot the criminals .
dad , you know what ?
you' re like me .
you get astonished when someone' s talking to you .
you go to sleep now .
bullet !
mom !
they' re here .

bullet , you behave .
mom , don' t worry .

put your bag down .
take a sit .
it amazes me how ray can talk to bullet .
i don' t know either .
i have been with bullet for thirty years
and up to now i still find it hard to talk to him .
i heard that the prize is big money .
it is .
that' s why flor allowed bullet to join .
we can save that money for his schooling .

what' s with you ?
what' s wrong ?
wait !

but in a way ... have your mother received the package ?
don' t worry .

no , we' re looking for a container van .
what' s in it ?
it contains sports cars .
maybe i can help you here , but ...
can you give me any proof ?
so i could start looking for it .

elly , may i ask ... when is bob coming home ?
he' il be coming home next week .
i told him not to extend his contract in taiwan .
bullet , why not stay here until next week ?
so that you can see my father .
why not .
these two barely see each other and you' re only staying for 2 days .
