i' il stay in bed today
you sure ?
all right , then
here we go ...
you' il be fine , old lady
you ' re still healthy , and these clothes finally suit you
but i car t stay here
ouch , ouch
it' s not easy being old
they ' re saying this war is going to be terrible ...
like a hand , granny ?
such a gentleman , but i' il manage
sure , old lady , but where are you of f to ?
just a bit farther than where you ' re going
i dor t recommend it , granny
nothing but witches and wizards ahead
thank you
going to the folding valley , at this hour ?
says her youngest sister' s there
i ve hardly made any progress a t all
thank goodness i' ve still got my teeth
that ii make a good cane
up we go
might be a bit too thick
ouch , ouch
wha t a stubborn branch
never underestima te grandma sophie
heave
a scarecrow , eh ?
i thought you were working f or the witch
but how do you stand by yourself ?
your head' s a turnip
i' ve always hated turnips
at least you ' re not upside down anymore
so long
it' s so cold
the towr s still so close
dor t follow me you don t owe me a thing
you must be a magical whatever you are
i ve had enough of witches and spells !
just go stand wherever you like !
this is a perf ect cane thank you kindly
while you ' re a t it , could you bring me a house to sleep in ?
seems you get more cunning with age
what a huge battleship
i never realized how weak you f eel when you get old
i smell smoke maybe there s a cabin
turnip head , isr t that howl s castle ?
this is hardly wha t i meant when i asked for shelter !
wha t is this ?
you call this a castle ?
is tha t the way in ?
just wait up there
hey , there !
are you going to let me on , or not !
my shawl !
it seems warm enough inside , turnip i' m going in
thank you
even howl wouldn t want an ancient heart like mine
this time , it' s really goodbye
you may be a turnip , but you ' re a good turnip
may you find happiness
wha t is this place ?
just looks like a dilapida ted heap
well , one nice thing about getting old is that nothing surprises you anymore
that s some spell you re under
it won t be easy to break
the fire talked
and you car t even tell anyone about it
you re howl ?
wrong .
i' m the fire demon , calcif er !
well , then , calcif er , can you break the spell i m under ?
easy
if you break the spell tha t chains me to this place ,
i' il break your spell in a flash
in other words , bargain with a demon
you sure you can keep that promise ?
demons dor t make promises
i suggest you look elsewhere
but i' m an exploited demon
i' m chained here by a contract with howl , who works me to death
i m the one who keeps this castle moving
my , you' ve got it rough
if you figure out the secret contract , the spell will break
if you do tha t , i ii break your spell , too
all right a bargain , eh ?
granny
granny
boy ...
i ve got my doubts about her
hey , who' s this ?
porthaven !
when did she get in ?
stand by
why , mayor , sir
the sun is already high is master jenkins a t home ?
the master is out
i answer in his stead
an invita tion from his majesty
it has come to war
his majesty desires every wizard and magician , even the witches , to aid our homeland
his presence is impera tive tha t is all
war , how awful
and who might you be ?
calcif er let me in
don t look at me she wandered in from the wastes
the wastes ?
that' s strange you ' re not a witch , are you ?
a witch could never get in
porthaven , again
a customer ?
stand by
state your purpose
mama sent me
the usual spell ?
behave yourself , now
it s not the wastes
granny , are you a witch , too ?
that' s right , i' m the scariest witch in the land
sprinkle this powder on your ship and the winds will f avor it
sure
many thanks
i car t have you making up things
you should give up that disguise
it' s not a disguise , it' s magic
the kingsbury door
stand by
is this the residence of wizard pendragon ?
it is , indeed
i bear an invitation from his majesty
please inform master pendragon that he is required at the palace
our thanks to you
a city fit for a king
get back in or you' il lose your nose
stop wandering around
that' s enough !
i m going to get really mad
this is a magic house , isn t it ?
oh , boy !
where does the black one lead ?
only master howl knows
i m having my break f ast
but you ve got bacon and eggs
we car t use the fire when master howl s away
i' il cook f or you

calcif er only obeys master howl
that s right , i wor t cook f or you
oh , here' s my hat
all right , calcif er be a good fire , now
forget it , i' m a demon
i answer to no one
you' il do as i say , or i' il pour water on you
or would you rather i told howl about our bargain ?
hey !
hey !
i never should ' ve let this old lady in
so , what' il it be ?
that' s right , there s a good fire
hey !
hey !
i' il burn the bacon
calcif er' s doing wha t she says
i' d like some tea , too have you got a kettle ?
sure
welcome home , master howl

she abused me
if i die , howl goes with me
i' m the cleaning lady
it s my job to clean

my little outburst gave me back my strength
wha t a strange house

calcif er , calcif er !

you re incredible , calcif er
your magic s first class i misjudged you completely

how beautiful
it' s called star lake
something s stuck in there
oh , dear lend me a hand , markl

a scarecrow
he s called turnip , the turnip head
you sure like being upside down
the odd creature seems to have taken a liking to me
he followed me here
are you sure you re not a witch , sophie ?
that' s right , i m the cleanest witch in the land
turnip , dor t pull it so tight
seems like he likes doing the wash
they ii dry in no time
turnip must belong to the demons
calcif er doesn t seem to mind him
you ' re right , maybe he s a demon of the dead
but he led me to this wonderful place
i' ve put away all the laundry , sophie
why , thank you we d better be getting back
how mysterious
i' ve never felt such peace
stinks
you reek of burnt flesh and steel
keep flying and one day you wor t be able to change yourself back

sophie did this f or me
the fighting is fierce
the country s ablaze , from the southern coast to the northern border
i ha te the fire in gunpowder
they have no manners
my own kind a ttacked me
the witch of the waste ?
hack wizards masquerading as monsters
they' il cry plenty later on , when they can t regain human f orm

i didn t mix up anything , i simply cleaned up
cleaning , always cleaning
i told you not to get too carried away

how humiliating
it' s not so very bad
this new shade' s quite lovely in its way
i' m done f or .
what s the point in living , if you arer t beautiful ...
stop , howl !
cut it out !
he' s calling on the spirits of darkness
he did this last time a girl ditched him

you can just dye your hair again
i' ve had enough of you , howl !
i ve never once been beautiful !
i' ve had enough of this place !

i' il leave it here drink it while it s hot
dor t lea ve me , sophie
try a little milk ?
the witch of the waste is searching for my house
you re right , i saw her cronies down at the port
the truth is , i m a coward
all this junk is just sorcery to keep her away
i m scared to death
tell me , why is the witch of the waste a f ter you ?
she seemed quite interesting , so i approached her
but she terrified me and i ran away
now the king s ordered me to report to him
as jenkins and as pendragon ...
how many names do you use , howl ?
enough to guarantee my freedom
car t you refuse the king ?
see tha t ...
the oa th i took a t the sorcery academy
say , howl why not visit the king ?
wha t !
just say it to his face
stop this f oolish war i refuse to help you
sophie , you dor t know what they ' re like
but he' s the king , right ?
a king thinks only of what s best f or his people
i know !
you' il go in my place , sophie !
pretend you re pendragon s mother
just tell him your son is an idle good for nothing
maybe madam suliman will even give up on me

sure
see you later !
this charm assures your sa fe return
don t worry , i' il follow you in disguise
there of f you go !
i' m sure this will never work
i dor t suppose he' s following me , disguised as a crow
i' m sure howl would pick a more drama tic disguise
not that ...
the palace is so f ar away
howl ?
dor t tell me you ' re howl
disguising yourself as an old dog , of all things
do you know how exhausting it is to be old ?
how nice to see you the little ha tter , right ?
the witch of the waste !
thank you so much for delivering my note to howl
how' s howl doing ?
quite terrified
thanks to him , i' ve become a cleaning lady
my how delightful
by the way , wha t brings you to see the king ?
job hunting i' m sick of working for howl
and yourself ?
the king invited me
it seems that idiot , suliman , finally needs my power
why don t you break the spell you put on me
that' s impossible
my gif ts lie in casting spells , not breaking them
see you la ter , then
hey , wait a minute just wait !
if you weren t here , i d have hit her with my cane
