don' t wory max, there is someone special out there for you
what do they think , i' m not trying ?
you know henry ?
i don' t think she exists .
and the truth is , if i did find her , i don' t think i' d know to do it anyway .
max , will you stop beating yourself ?
i don' t know how to date .
what is " datlng " ?
i mean , look at those two .
even that guy has a girlfriend .
i' m such a shmug .
the last thing you need right now is a girlfriend
some chick missing with your head , going so cool with you .
pretty soon , she starts pulling the same crap all women do .
so they think its thier mission to change us ,
even though they' r the ones that screwed up .
you know , like they' r all dressing " oh, sexy " to get your attention . but then you follow one of them from apart ,
and she slaps a restraining order on you .
you kidnapped your dog .
that' s not the point .
the point is ....
before you know it , she' d been ... nagging you into submission , and keepin you on a leech . .. so you' r away from your friends . you know what the best part of a blowjob is ?
ten minutes of silence .
no man understands women ...
it' s like we genetically programmed , to think differently .
never mind . we have bigger problems .
jonas has invited president chumly , to watch his test for replicator today .
oh , why he wants to do something stupid like that for ?
genetics conference is live in a week away , we' re on the replicator work , ..
so jonas is losing his mind
hey , felix .
oh , jesus . what caught up your ass ? just look at yourselves , we' re presenting our work to the president of the univercity , and you look like you just got out of your bed .
i did just got out of bed .
i' m very tired , see , having spending a hundred hours a week in the lap ... for the last six months to make sure my work is ready
what you' ve been up to ?
he' s been busy kissing jonas' s ass .
ha , ha , ha .
we' re gonna be late .
why ? why he , you see , like that ?
ah . hmm
now take a good look , sir , because you wont believe your eyes , otherwise .
it' s true . what dr. fromer done here , is absolutely amazing .
felix ?
mm hm ?
if you feel comfortable removing your nose , face and head , from jonas' s ass , henry can use some help with that .
at least one of us gives dr. fromer the respecthe deserves .
oh , that what it is ? don' t make me ...
don' t do !
oh , that is so abnoxious !
a single drop of her blood contains all the genetic lnformation we need .
we simply put it into the replicator , where it will combine with a special hormon growth solution that , i have developed .
okay , let' s get to it .
yes .
okay .
this better work .
now president chumly , a simple drop of blood
or strand of hair , contains all the genetic lnformation we need . then , with the hyper replicator we can circumventing normal stages of development , and instantly create a full grown adult clone .
here is the original . and here is fluffy .
fluffy two .
am hm , fluffy two .
oh , fantastic work , jonas .
i was getting a little worried , when i fought so hard to get the international genetics conference here ,
that you gonna let me down .
but now , the world will be stunned . ... when we present this .
you' il make springdale univercity famous .
you do better than that , you will make it super famous .
i could not have done that without your support , sir .
if they could have done it .
i' m going to lunch with the trust eve .
why don' t you join me ?
i' il be delighted , sir .
thank you .
i' il be right there , just give me a minute with my staff . super .
i want a full biological review done ...
on that rodent . cellular morphology growth rate , brain wave function ,
sexual viabiltiy everything .
a full biological ?
well look , she is fine .
as you may recall , we' ve done that with the last fluffy two
untill she mysteriously ... imploded .
we need to present a perfect clone to the conference next week
and if we don' t ,
well you can forget about that associate professorship .
been here for years .
i practically developed the hyper replicator , you know that .
jonas said he' d make me associate professor , if i stuck fine ,
henry have stuck ?
oh , i have stuck .
you stuck .
if you do this ...
i deserve a promotion .
and you will get it .
but there is no way he can deny you ,
after this presentation . if every thing goes all right .
will you even buy attention in there ?
we can make enough hamsters , to feed every starving kid in thailand .
can' t feed hamsters to children .
henry , any number of things can go wrong .
i mean , he is rush to a senator' s conference
i don' t have time for a proper biological ...
do not focus on that lap .
you need to chill out ..
go out and find some hot chick to jack your penis into oh , that' t brilliant , that' s what i need .
yes  that' s not what i need , what i need is
you have chosen wisely , my son .
no , no , no . no
henry , end badly . always is badly , everyone single time
god , she is just stunning . yes !
what could i possibly have in common with that woman ?
molecular cell blology
oh , god .
you might just not hang out with your balls raw ' cause you are not obviously man anymore ,
she is out my league , henry .
girls like that date pro athletes or rock stars
what are you talking about , " rock star " ?
i' m just being a realistic man .
i' m a lab assistant .
this is nothing girls find exciting . ever .
excuse me . hi .
didn' t i see you in dr. fromer' s lab this afternoon ?
yes .
yeah . yes .
i am a huge fan of genetics .
oh , i' m sorry . you guys probably get that all the time .
not as much as you think .
well , i' m kate carson , and i' m doing a piece on genetics for modern science of magazine .
i interview
dr. fromer this morning about the hyper replicator .
well , today is your lucky day .
because , max here knows everything about the replicator .
i' m sure he can fill you in .
that would be wonderfull .
and this is a clone ?
no , this is just a beta test .
ther have been a few kinks .
well , she looks healthy to me .
you
how long you' v been doing this ?
since i was five . did you watch " scooby doo " when you were a little ?
ofcourse i did .
okay .
remember the one with the rich , handsome , oil tycoon
ask velma out on a date , and she curiously peggerously declines ? vaguely .
same episode , shaggy gets cloned .
and ever since i saw that , i' ve been hooked .
i had to be the guy that , making cloning a reality .
and with this technology , kate , the possibilities are endless .
i mean , we can save endangered species from becoming extinct ... we can grow human organs for transplants ,
we might be able to cure cancer .
i love genetics . i always have .
and i think i can make the world a better place .
i know exactly what you mean .
i mean , i' ve wanted to be a journalist
since i was a kid .
and i always thought i can get
ouch ! he bit me !
fluffy !
oh , my god is she okay ? she is a little dizzy , but she is fine . how is your finger ?
it' s fine .
it' s just a little blood .
i think i' m gonna need a bandage .
i' ve got some in the first workstation , second drawer .
ok . are you gonna be okay ?
oh , i' il be fine .
i , just had a little problem with blood .
but i' m sorry , i should' ve warned you about fluffy , that fluffy is sort of adjusting to being alive .
please don' t even wory about that . it' s fine .
are you sure you gonna be okay ?
yeah , i' il be fine .
oh , god , is that clock right ?

look, look, look . you see ?
pick yourself up and just
whoa !
morning , sir .
well , well , well , i see you finally showing , the kind of dedication i expect .
well , you' il be glad to hear , that the replikator is working perfectly .
i' m just dog tired ,
so i' m gonna get some sleep . i' il see ya .
oh ! no , no !
oh , oh , oh
oh , dear . kate ! kate !
do not eat the hamster !
yep , i love college .
what' s up ?
oh , thank god . thank god that you are here !
this better be important .
it' s 7 : 00 am, me wouldn' t even be up yet . it' s important . i had a little accident at the lab last night .
did you break the replicator ?
did you sell fluffy this time ?
remember kate ? the modern science goddess from yesterday ?
i cloned her .
oh , yeah . ha, ha . very funny , man .
ae h , you ain' t even a reporter
or you' r just some old friendi rott in to put in this lime gag ?
i' il tell you , when it comes to jokes , you are crap .
henry !
oh , shit .
i still don' t believe it , a human clone .
you made a fully grown biologically correct , extremely sexy human clone , max !
really illegal , henry !
we' il go to jail . we' r so screwd !
what , we screwd ?
fuck that .
henry ! i' m talking about the clone and i.
i can use some help here buddy , please .
hm
yeah, sure . you ain' t have to ask .
right .
first of all , we must make sure .. that no one finds out .
she can' t be a clone , unless there is an original , and the original is in europe , right ?
hatchom !
so all we gonna do is teaching her , to behave like a normal person .
unless , ofcourse she is a total morron .
no , she is not a total morron .
she just hasn' t that time to simulate yet .
her brain is perfect !
it' s like a sponge .
she can learn in a day what could normally take years .
she' s a blank slate right now !
so .. we could program her .
she is not a vcr, henry, we' re talking about .
we can make a woman ,
who likes sports .. and action movies and hanging out in the bars and not cats , or winecollars or fool play .
you mean, make a woman ,
who acts exactly like a man .
exactly . the perfect woman .
a woman, that man can actually understand .
what did you do that for ?
i don' t know .
i mean, yes, we have to assimilate her , but
stop it !
i suppose to certain extenize her duties , _ try to make a better human being .
exactly .
now , she shouldn' t have time problems or be obssesed about her weight .
and she has to learn how to drive .
stick !
and football and sunday does not end
untill monday night .
this is perfect .
oh , there' s so much stuff .
i don' t even know where to begin .
my vow is for housebreaking .
that' s nasty .
oh, come on !
here , these are books .
we learn things by reading these .
television, however is much easier to use and much more fun .
television .
this is a home arcade system . very cool .
i' ve got 49 games that you can play on this , 48 of which, are sports games .
some times, it is fun , to watch one friend' s puke . puke . this is toiletpaper .
this is hair . never spend more than five minutes styling .
definitly .
may be ten . this too, toiletpaper .
when you really on the pench .
jonas is an  asshole .
when we see felix , we  kick him .
these are nipples . nipples .
now show me yours .
no , no , you don' t have to do that . come on .
stop it , would you cut it out ?
these are flowers .
flowers are not important .
no . bad . movies with singing
duh, crap .  unacceptable . yes . seriously , size doesn' t matter .
run . i run , you run , henry runs
lch run , you run , henry run .
i get it already .
are we gonna stay here all day ?
can we go do something fun ?
come on, give me a pass !
split fingers , fast ball .
got it ?
got it .
all right . throw to henry now .
that' s not henry .
sorry man , sheve never played baseball
hey, i didn' t do .... !
aah !
that' s called giving him a " bitch lap " .
this is pizza .
we eat food , to survive .
oh, you damned .
this, this is how we make pizza .
mmh !
stuck .
oh . oh , whoa let me , you haven' t !
this is beer .
beer is good .
mmm .
beer is good .
i like that . that' s just impressiver .
here , have another one .
split all back, drop to middle .
okay ! pop quiz .
what is this one ?
nature documentary .
if it' s about sharks, or animals attacking people ,
they' re good . otherwise .... boring .
excellent . high five .
ae h, like this .
yeah , this way .
oh .
kill him ! that' s good ! very good !
hey, look at you face . i' ve blewn you head off
it was an accident .
kate ?
kate !
kate, oomf !
kate , stop it !
right foot, that' s your gas .
that' s what gonna make you go .
now your left foot , that' s .. that' s the brake !
uh !
shi
can you beleive i could keep this stuff up ?
it' s incredible .
so i' m gonna keep teaching her what' s important .
oh, yeah .

you know , i think i' m gonna go stop the car .
the " wedding singulars " is good ?
oh, yeah .

oh , no , you can do it where ever you like , and at any time ,
and with as many girls as possible .
you don' t even have to know thier names .
dammit .
what is wrong with you ?
what are you doing ?
why you showing her that ?
you said show her what is important , and this is very important to me .
oh , come on .
oh , well , watching all these pornos makes me horny .
oh , this is awesome . no .
no sex . we have enough to worry about than this .
hey , will you do some of this ?
what we do think about , we don' t think about sex .
looks at that .
the defense is playing like shit !
get to the quarterback !
don' t let them tremple like that !
get in there, put him on his ass !
dude , we are fuckin ' geniuses .
this game sucks .
let' s go home and have sex .
uh, we' re ready to close out here . come on , please . pretty please  that' s not a good ldea .
oh, come on . listen
i learned some really cool stuff from those pornos ...
and there is that one thing called the blowjob .
you know , i can do it right here .
what ? no , stop it !
he he he .
no , you are not ready for blowjobs .
i' m not ?
no .
dude .
damn .
i gotta practice .
excuse me !
anybody wants a blowjob ? yeah, i do sure .
on a second thought , let' s go . let' s go home
hey ! you know what ?
we should probably ask another woman to join us , because they always do that in the videos . oh, that waht they do ?
yeah
thank you , henry !
oh , hey .
my friend max ,
is gonna take me home and fuck me like the bitch i' m .
you wanna come ?
that' s the hiroine talking .
what' s hiroine ?
that was nice, it was like a frek show
ah !
sex , now .
i heard that !
i really love you kate, but i just ,
i feel like you' re the results of the complications ,
involving .. um, you know , emotinal attachement .
less talking, more sex .
valid argument .
there' s still though, i mean numerous ethical dominants ,
inheriting the act ,
including
lower .
no , no , not . you technically, you' re ten years old .
you don' t wanna have sex with me ?
no , i don' t .
yes , i do .
max , i think you accidentally locked the door !
it' s definitly locked !
would you just get my leg back . i may be
oh .
could we, could we jus  schhhh .
aah !
ooh !
it kicks the shit outta kissing !
high five !
well , i' m beat .
kate ? , you want ... you wanna talk ?
kate ?
morning , babe .
you were great last night .
i feel ,
like i just got back of the rodeo .
well, i hope you are hungery ,
cause i made an omelett . or something like an omelett .
i' m good , thanks .
oh . okay .
you know what you gona need this morning ?
oh , what' s that ?
me .
no , no .
no , i have to go to work .
oh, can i go ? no no no .
i need you to stay here, and hold down the fort ,
like a trooper
and there are rules , for when i' m gone . okay ?
brush your teeth .
several times .
no leaving the house , when i' m not here .
if anything happens , i need you to call me at this
special emergency number .
says lab .
kate ?
kate , did you hear me ?
yeah , whatever .
when will you be home ?
i don' t know exactly .
i have a lot of work to do today .
but, there is plenty of things here you can entertain yourself with . you got a globe , there is some dice over there .
ae h , there is a book .
you should try reading a book .
or a magazine !
and then there is albums and cds and , ae h
ofcourse, there is always the television as well !
max !
we got a problem ! i was drunk , i was weak . _ lch intend not before , with it to sleep . ' n was error .
you know i didn' t mean to sleep with her . big mistake .
yeah ? well , it is just got bigger .
couldn' t possibly get any bigger we meet again !
aah !
i told you he' d be excited , to see you . what , you ?
what happened .. you were flying . you were jetting
no . modern science thought there may be a bigger story here
so, jonas agreed to let me spend a week in the lab, he' s even renting me his guest room .
i' m going to be here untill your presentation .
isn' t that exciting ?
more than you could possibly imagine .
what about your boyfriend ?
isn' t he upset ?
he is not my boyfriend anymore .
we broke up .
but he seemed like such a nice guy, very, very talented .
may be you should go back and give him a second chance, and patch things up .
i don' t think that' s gonna happen .
after talking to you the other day ,
i realised how truely important my work is to me .
and derek just never got that .
it was time to break it off .
is something wrong ?
no ,
i just , ah ,
i didn' t think i was gonna see you again
for the rest of my life .
i just hope you guys don' t get sick of me ,
because i' m gonna be around you guys 24 hours a day .
ooh, look who finally decided ... to join us this morning ..
i need you to look at fluffy two .
something is wrong with her .
with fluffy ? what' s wrong ?
this is all she does .
well , i suppose if we look on putting all the hamster production on one flew off the cocko' s nest ,
we' ve been in pretty good shape, will we ?
we have a genetics conference in three days , and we don' t have yet a perfect clone !
so , nobody leaves this lab untill this problem is fixed .
ah , sir , i have very important business to take care of tonight .
well, it' s a shame ,
and though i thought you' d be quite dedicated to this job .
hey , max , if fluffy is going all funny ,
you think this has anything to do with ?
no , she has a human brains ,
the most advanced learning device that ever known to man .
she is probably in home , memorizing the encyclopedia .
yes !
go , go
so much for the replicator , huh ?
ah ! aua !
my hormon growth solution reminds gives me extra kick, if you will, to the growth medium only the kick if you want so .
and thus, with the hyper+stimulated cell division  you can bypass the stages of normal cell growth to create an adult clone .
impressive .
but how do you deal with the keytone shift
of the mitochondrian variation during rapid zellmitoses ?
well , i would mind abored you with the technical jugg on , miss carson , because it' s very, very complicated stuff . oh, my godness !
ah , i wonder , what is going on over there over there , in the hamster research station .
well , ti looks like fluffy two stopped running into the wall .
yes, because she is not in her self conscious, sir ,
ah , even after i put a helmet on her . i think i figured out what' s wrong .
the cloning process messes up the brain .
fluffy two pain receptors actually formed as pleasure receptors .
which explains , why she keeps pumbing her head into the wall .
she finds the experience joyfull .
felix , only you could come up with the scientific theory
messes up the brain .
now please , one of you has actually learned something today ?
wait a second .
that' s it , sir .
learning . there is nothing wrong with fluffy two' s brain .
she just hadn' t had the experience yet .
she will learn how to behave from other members of her species .
we isolated this clone .
i think , we should put her with other hamsters .
are you saying , a clone made from this process ,
has the capacity to learn ?
yes , sir ,
it' s exactly what i' m saying .
jaah
heja ! ouch ...
max , you think i can get that interview ? now ?
no , but felix will be more than happy to sit down with you .
we' il speak tomorrow .
so , eh
you seem like a really nice person .
oh , hi . i found this in your bed .
and i need some of these tit restraining devices .
wait a sec .
hi . i' m brandy .
how are you guys today ?
i' m working on it , brandy .
how are you ?
oh , i' m fine , thank you .
is there anything i can help you with ? yeah .

brandy , these are all dreadfull . all of them .

okay .
shopping is over .
let' s go .
no, wait , i need some bras , and i don' t wanna come here yet, everything tastes that .
fine . how is this ?
okay , we' il test try ...
no, not here . you do that in the changing room, okay ?
okay . go to
oh , no .
oh, what are you doing back ? you' re not supposed to be in here ?
ah um , i know .
yes , but i found something else that i think you might like .
oh , really ? what ?

ah ! aah !
whoa .
the original was the clone .
and which you thought was the clone , was the original .
the clone came to work when we were away , but then the original came back ,
and i' ve got to get the clone home now before the original sees her !
what was the first bit again ? that , ah um , the clone
you were speaking to the clone . who is that ? that is the original !
but she wanted to
just keep an eye on things !
okay .
okay .
max , there is something wrong with fluffy two . she sounds sick .
sick ?
what' s wrong with fluffy two ?
what' s up ?
i don' t know .
well she seems like a little indigesting may be . did you take samples ?
no, not yet . get me a hypo, henry .
but that' s blood, you
there is no time . get the needle .
okay .
max, are you sure ? i mean, what if there' s something wrong with the cloning process ?
there is nothing wrong with the process .
hello , everybody .
hi .
how is our project coming on ?
fine , sir .
this is a perfectly , healthy clone .
that is fuckin ' awesome .
what did you do ? !
aaah !
i just stuck in the needle , stuck in the needle .
i knew she was sick !
so what does that mean ? every clone we make is gonna explode .
oh , no . oh , no !
aah ! aah !
sir, please, sir . please !
oh , god , you do not look so good .
i feel so good .
i feel like i' m gonna burst .
oh, jesus . you are ! take cover ! we all might die .
everyone take cover !
we need a doctor immediately !
sir , there is others in front of you .
mary langner , this is a matter of life and death .
that woman can explode any minute
when she does, the whole building comes down with her .
i need every doctor you' ve got .
and possibly the bomb squad .
what' s wrong ?
am i gonna be okay ?
i think that' s the last ever .
i think there' s a little bit intestinals up here . .
actually , i believe that' s a spleen .
i don' t care what it is ,
just, clean it up .
get it off the ceiling . if you don' t mind .
where is max ?
ah , he had an emergency to tale care of .
oh , he had an emergency to tale care of , i see .
that makes all sense to me .
do me a small favor .
if anybody hears from max , would you give him a message from me ? .
would you tell him , to get his ass back here !
now !
okay .
hydrogen sulfat , danger explosive
she' s had a little bit too much soda , but otherwise she' s fine .
so that' s it ?
i mean , that she' s not going to explode ?
ah , no, no .
in fact , she is healthiest person ..
i' ve ever seen in my life . really ?
not enough of cholesterol , perfect x rays , every blood cell .. seems to be brand new ,
max , watch , if i leave this thing longer , my whole arm turns purple .
look !
no , she' s not the brightest bomber, is she ?
hey, you know what' s on tonight ? wrestling !
let' s order pizza !
i don' t want pizza , okay ?
i think i' m going on a diet .
we' re starting a bite job .
just once, i would love to sit down and , i don' t know ... talk !
hello , can you can you talk to me ? can we do that ?
i do not think so , okay ? that' s not funny , kate .
i smell that cooking !
we never talk .
i' m not just some thrusting, verile ...
okay , okay .
quite, quite .
come on .
we can talk , okay ?
we can have a nice happy conversation about
ouch , that' s a little rough !  wrestling ! body slam ! i' ve got you now !
</ i > this is henry . listen . < i>
< i>your job is on the line . </ i >
< i>jonas is pissed that you didn' t finally started going</ i > < i>you better call me . </ i >
dammit , kate , would you get off me ?
< i>max , it' s kate . </ i >
you know someone else named kate ?
ah , i  who is she ? !
ouch ! no one important , okay ? ! who is she ? !
she is the reporter ,
i went to lunch with .
she is covering my work .
do you wanna screw up ? we are just friends . okay
we didn' t have a lot in common .
i just enjoy being with her .
so , that' s a total waste of time .
okay , tabby , comes .
enough for a threat .
time for some sex !
not tonight , i have headache .
auu !
max , how did it go last night ?
any more problems with repli kate ?
problems ?
all i have is problems .
wet still have to move the replicator to the auditorium for the presentation ,
we' ve no idea what happened to poor fluffy two ,
and i have an insane clone , literally , destroying my appartment .
she' s developed into a reality problem, henry .
what you mean ?
waht i mean, i think we made a mistake .
we should' ve exposed her to a few feminine influences .
like what ? dishing ?
i' m seriuos .
i' m hanging out with repli kate , and she is acting just like a guy .
but it is not as good as we thought it was going to be .
i' m begining to wonder , what women even seen us
dude , wat' s your problem ?
she is a woman ,
who acts like a man , it' s what every man wants .
no, it' s what every man says he wants ,
may be all the things we don' t understand about women
all this little korks they drive us crazy , may be this is more important than we realize .
repli kate listens , but she doesn' t hear me .
she' s completly self involved .
i don' t know , she just hasn' t date i feel like i' m dating ..... me ....
i' il never get that lucky .
what do you think what happens if the real kate found out ?
don' t even say that .
don' t you think she has the right to know ?
oh , you ldiot .
two identical women , and you fall for the one that blew you in a bar .
carefull with that .
that is expensive . do you understand me ? you get it , expensive , cost a lot money .
is kate here ?
yeah, over there .
that' s not gonna fit through those door , felix .
hey , what happened to you yesterday ?
i' ve tried to reach you .
i' m so sorry i didn' t call you back .
i' ve been, i had to rush a friend of mine into the university infirmary .
i hope i' m not interrupting , but i just heard something very funny , and i thought i' d share it with you, my friends .
evidentally, it was discovered that the reason fluffy two exploded ... was because someone in here fed her hydrogen sulfat .
now, here is the funny part
it was discovered by miss carson , who was not a geneticist by profession .
and yet seems to know more about what' s going on this lab
than you two , pathetic excuses scientists .
i have a presentation in 24 hours , and just yesterday we have disquit the guest honour off the walls with a shammy . now !
this replicator has to be moved , a new clone made and a new set of data derived .
if this is not done, if this presentation is in anyway compromised , then you will not only be out of the job tomorrow ,
but i will see to it you will never work in this field again .
do you dig it ? !
sir , if you thinking, by threatening me , you can force me .. to be your slave, well
you can' t shit .
max , i have
oh , miss carson , i don' t think max needs any more distractions from you .
now, why don' t we discuss the nights lnterview with my home .
dude, you' il be here all night .
repli kate' s gonna freak .
no, she won' t, cause you gonna be keeping an eye on her . what ?
just , give her two sixpacks .. of burger and several hours of cartoons .
okay .
hi . uh
hi , mary langner . hello .
i' m from the biomedical labs here on campus .
i understand you treated a friend of mine, yesterday .
she came came with someone named max flemming .
oh , a tall girl, good looking , no insurance ?
that' s her .
yes .
hey .
amm , the eighth grade was fascinatingfor a number of variations . yeah, this is so amazing .
and you' ve given me such wonderfull information ...
it' s almost overwhelming .
i should probably get some rest before the big day tomorrow .
oh, yes , i do have a speech to prepare myself .
yes, you do . and i' m gonna let you to that ....
so, thank you so much .
well, good night .
wanna a beer ?
i' m not in the mood .
what' s up ?
it' s max .
first , i thought we was cool and all .
but he' s just gone wierd on me .
he doesn' t wanna play video games ,
he doesn' t wanna watch sports , he' s on a diet !
yeah , i didn' t know he was starting to ounch up a bit .
yeah, and he' s not putting out , so
what ? you mean you two on
we did it once, and that was two days ago .
see, all i want is just have a lot of casual sex without getting bugged in a relationship .
but it' s just he had these issues with it .
what' s up with that ?
i don' t know .
you wanna shag someone, shag him .
what brings emotions to it, eh ?
dude , exactly .
it is not natural , to have sex with the same person . and i' m young .
if somebody wants to have sex with me , i think ,
i should have sex with them .
yeah, specially when max is so into
what did you say ?
oh , nothing .
this is bullshit .
so he can have sex with somebody else , and i can' t .
are you thinking what i' m thinking ?
what are you thinking ?
i' m sorry to bother you so late, sir , but i have something may be you really need to see .
have you seen this ? that woman has given max full credit for the replicator !
okay , but i
after all i' ve done for that kid , and this is how he rebays me ? !
if this goes to print , i' m finished !
i' m not so sure about that .
you gonna take a look at this .
why the long face ?
i just wanted to hel people, kate that' s all i' ve wanted to do .
and now it seems like .... every single thing i touch , turns to complete shi
i can' t stop screwing up .
max , listen . every great inventor screwed up
it took edison over thousand attempts , to create the light bulb . if you don' t make mistakes , you' il never learn .
how much of the repilcator was your idea ?
that' s hard to specify, i mean , jonas fill all the paper , and felix does a pretty job bringing bagels in the morning ...
public figure .
90 percent .
max, listen to me, you are going to help people .
you know , may be one day, you might even take credit for your own work .
this can' t be .
it is , ...
that' s the charts for the woman max took to the hospital ,
here' s the charts for fluffy two .
find this woman , tonight !
i' il do my best , sir .
mention " left me " ...
and for years , i' ve dreamed we could get back together .
and may be get married .
but it never did , because of the fucken dog .
enough with the murder mouth .
are you ready to go again yet ?
again ?
it' s been five years , you know ?
there is a limit to how long a man can go ! oh , really ?
yeah .
i' m outta here . what ?
besides , we' re out of beer .
all i need is ten minutes ...
and i' il be fine ! kate !
oh, my godness .
she' s perfect .
she sure is .
so, the woman that called you in the lab the other day ,
was she an ex girlfriend ?
ah , sort of .
what was she like ?
she was surprisingly like you
in a lot of ways ,
too much like me in all the others .
to tell you the truth , she is  so you' re not seeing anyone ?
no .
excuse me !
excuse me !
have anyone seen a girl just gone , that wants to have sex all the time ?
yeah, she' s in the back ..
with the easter bunny and santa claus .
she better be not shagging them .
kate ? kate !
i' m just com here to surprise you .
well, you did .
who the hell are you ?
oh , are you still mad of me ?
you , you look amazing .
did you do change your hair ?
no , it just got messed while i was banging henry .
ah , you slept with another guy already ?
it didn' t take very long , kate .
no, shit . it lasted two minutes stops .
what you' re doing is did it back to me ......
because you pissed that i screwed on you ?
no .
i' m doing this to get max for sleeping around on me .
ma max ?
you slept with two guys ?
yeah , and i' m looking for more .
okay , all right , baby , you made your point .
i cheated on you , i was on tour , and i was wrong ,
and i' m sorry .
okay ?
but they were groupies , baby .
it' s not a thing with real women .
i don' t care who you sleep with ,
what , you don' t care ,
if i' m having sex with other women , while i' m having sex with you ?
wait , you mean like threesome ?
no ! i will be totally into that .
i .. i get off a ten .
i know where to go .
that' s what i feel .
me too, me too .
thank you , kate .
thank you for tonight .
and for everything you said .
i really needed that .
do you know the real reason i broke up with derek ?
amm , because he was holding you back from doing what you really wanted to do
no ?
no .
because he was in a million years , he' d never do anything as sweet as this .
hey , beautifull .
do you really move when i ask you to join a threesome ?
ah umm . yeah .
you know , i got my ride waiting out ,
he' s dumb , but he is hot .
could we make that a foursome ?
oh , absolutely .
the more , the merrier .
let' s go .
excuse me please . kate , wait !
kate !
no , wait . what ?
we shouldn' t do this .
if jonas finds
no . he won' t .
he is in his office , practicing his speech .
besides , i don' t want you to go .
come .
you go ahead , make yourself comfortable
and while i' m refreshing up .
he can' t get angry at me for not finding her ,
this is a big town , i' m just one guy .
she' s not gonna just fall on my lap .
so , you' re staying there ?
the stay address your author gave me ?
yeah , that will do .
what is going on ?
we are allowed to be here , right ?
oh , who gives a shit ?
go find a bedroom .
go , bedroom .
hi .
let' s get this show on the road , girls .
yeah . come on .
he finally came to accept this .
oh . kate . wow .
mamma . listen , kate , ah umm
i could not dreamed of this whole thing any better ,
but there is something that i absolutely have to tell you
enough talking .
i have a surprise for you .
oh , what the hell ?

i' m back .
jonas , jonas .
jonas , are you around ? jonas !
i found her , sir !
sorry, sir . she' s downstairs .
i love that spot .
it' s like you know me already .
you know , usually i don' t do this so fast , but the last guy with this , he sucked in bed .
i' il go find the bedroom .
i' il be right there .
go on ahead , i' il be right there .
ouch !
thank you .
this is redicilous .
oh
wow . you are aside as i' m .

whoa , whoa !
if you all there ,
who is licking my balls ?
uuuh !
uuh !
kate ! kate , where are you ?
kate ! shit !
oh , shit .
no, shit .
you cannot do this to us , jonas .
i' m not responsible for your situation ,
max is . he cloned you .
i' m simply looking out for your best interrests .
by kidnapping us ?
you always wanted to be in science , oh, now you are science .
you feel it lucky . punk ? !
kate !
this is absolutely incredible .
she is a perfect clone .
sir , these women seemed kinda scared .
you sure this is the best way to handle .. ?
don' t be so thick headed .
the potential of this research , was always to clone a human being .
and now , that max drop us one on our laps , you won' t let her go .
those are no longer women in there ,
they' re founds for information that must be mined for science .
now, i' ve gotta go rehears my speech .
you stay here .
nobody goes in or out of that lab except me , understand ? !
yeah .
put a line !!
may be next prepare your hands
you stay away from me .
what' s up ?
jonas has the kates .
and he has revised his presentation , in order to frame us .
oh, that dick !
the moment those two girls walk across the stage tomorrow ,
they' il become lab rats for the rest of their lives .
yeah , we gotta call the cops .
where is the phone ?
and say what, henry ?
that somebody stole our clone .
we don' t even know where they are .
we know precisely that ... they' il be tomorrow at 9 : 00 am . presentation .
right . so what do we do ?
we use this .
pubes ?
that oh, yeah .
max , that bastard .
how could he do this to me ? to us ?
i don' t know .
besides he' s nagging and wagging
he was kinda cool to me .
i' m fine with him .
that doesn' t make what he did any less wrong .
he created you, so to a relationship with .
and why was he so interested in being with you ?
get out of here !
what ? i' m sorry ?
get out of here ! now !
but i thought
get out , get out !
get out , get out !
good clone, jonas .
such a good clone .
i think that went pretty well
it was hell of training him a five whole words .
penis .
ah , six words .
you shouldn' t have taught him that .
son of a don' t worry , we' il get you out of here ! right now !
stay there , stay .
tou have a lot of explaining to do .
i cloned you by accident .
i know it' s not an excuse , but it is the truth .
yeah , i did terrible thing , but i' m not like jonas .
i' m still the guy was last night ,
the guy, who is completely in love with you .
and will do anything for you .
could you be any sappier ?
the girls actually falls for this shit ?
i screwed up .
kate , i cloned you by accident .
i know it' s not an excuse ...
i heard you . but i see still have a thing for cloning people .
i don' t know , i didn' t know any way else to do .
as soon as jonas tell the world that you' re a clone and she' s a clone
just get me out of here .
all right . sorry .
you gonna be a research project for the rest of your live .
yeah , i know you hate me right now i' m not even blaming you .
but if we get out of here , we' ve got to work together .
okay , what do we do ?
we just had to get you out of here before jonas makes his speech .
where is repli jonas ? !
oh, punk .
find repli jonas , stall him !
do not let him get to the stage !
oh , here he is . excuse me .
where are you ? i' ve got a room full of people, waiting to see you .
whenever the front ..
when ever the frontiers of genetics are explored
felix ! felix !
if memory serves me correct , i thought i had asked you to stay back at the lab and guard the kates .
and so , a question comes to mind .
and you know what that question is ?
ah umm , no .
why are you here ?
oh , sir, i wouldn' t have guessed  zip it !
now why don' t you go back to the lab and stay there , untill i tell you to leave .
you can do that for me, can' t you ?
can you do that for me ?
you can do it, right ?
do it !!
okay , guys , guys , come .
she sells, sea shells, she sells, sea shells

no, seriuosly .
i' m excited .
and , ah , this is max , dr. fromer' s chief research assistant .
oh , you must be great , working with a genius like dr. fromer .
oh . i' m here because of dr. fromer .
he made me what i' m today .
i' m here because of dr. fromer .
he made me what i' m today .
i have a very important question to ask the doctor .
if you can excuse us .

i won' t be so sure about that !

how is there in beirut ?
whenever the fronteers men of genetics go exploring ,
they can encounter a questionable morality .
why are you doing this ? you know you don' t have to .
i' m squirrel with a nut , trying not to knock you, kate .
holy shit !
another clone ! jonas !!
have it !
another clone !
oh !
and felix is down to the ten . yeeeah !

and now , we take this blood here , and  we combine it with some genetic , ah um , hormone stuff , put it right in the replicator
malfunctlon .
and now , ladies and gentlemen
abnormal dna palrs .
repllcatlon errors !
prepare yourself for the unbelievable ,
a fully grown , adult clone !
is that bad ?
is that bad ?
there seems to be a small technical problem ,
ladies and gentlemen , but
i can assure you that this machine does indeed work .
because my assistant max even cloned a human being in this machine .
