not even at the end , when they gave him his lethal injection .
he was chatty , " his guard said .
he wanted to discuss the chicago cubs and eat fried chicken .
i' m gonna take a sleeping pill .
two , in fact .
do you want one ?
no .
it' s so fucking noisy i can' t sleep .
i have to move .
i mean , clearly , i have got to move .
why don' t you see him again .
you' re brave in so many ways .
you' re thinking about him , right ?
about sex .
so ?
you wouldn' t be thinking about the sex if you didn' t like him .
well , at least call him .
he doesn' t know where you are .
i go to court tomorrow ... ... because of the tan suit .
they' re trying to get a restraining order against me .
probably won' t be allowed within 500 miles of dr. cass ' office .
yeah , laugh it up .
you know what i' m thinking ?
what to wear .
no , i' m imagining that when he sees me ... ... he' s gonna realize that he' s in love with me , and , you know ... ... one thing will lead to another , and after a love child or two ... ... we' il get married .
have i ever told you how our father proposed to my mother ?
no .
tell me .
well , when he was very young , he was ... ... very handsome and an excellent skater .
and she was the new girl in town , barely able to skate .
she was very , very innocent .
very beautiful .
of course .
and he was already engaged , but he couldn' t stop watching my mother .
this is my song .
and finally ... ... his fiancee got very jealous and
i would too .
and threw that engagement ring right back at him .
whoa .
and that very same day ... ... he took my mother by the hand ... ... he danced her out to the middle of the forest fringed lake ... ... he got down on one knee ... ... and offered her the very same engagement ring .
oh , that' s nice .
and at that precise moment , which is the thing my mother always added ... ... it started to snow .
that' s very romantic .
i don' t quite believe it .
but that' s my mother' s story .
that' s the way she always told it , you know .
he killed her .
when he left , she just went crazy with grief .
you know , she didn' t understand it .
she just couldn' t believe it .
how many times has dad been married ?
four .
four ?
he never married my mother .
yeah , he was already plotting the fifth .
i want to get married once ... ... just for my mom .
is a husband too much for me to ask for ?
it' s too hot .
even angela sands had a fiance .
yeah .
well , he probably cut her head off .
that' s sad .
i' il see you later on , doc .
sure .
i' m gonna start opening up the machine .
open her slightly , let some fluid out , and we' il catch it at the catch basin .
on three .
one , two , three .
i' m taking out the first article of clothing .
i' ve got
it appears to be a woman' s left hand , and on it is ... ... a ring with a white stone in it .
do me a favor .
get a close up of that .
it appears to be possibly a serrated blade .
come over here with me , and what i' d like to do is get another shot .
over here , give me a close up on that .
thank you .

got it .

i thought the guy was wearing a mask .

you' re a school teacher , right ?
people count on your memory .
detective rodriguez bothering you ?

how did you get to be a homicide detective so young ?
me ?
yeah .
ln a word ?
yeah .
compassion .
i took the desk no one else wanted .
what desk was that ?
the desk next to the holding cell .
you know , so i talked to the perps .
gave them cigarettes , gum , so they start to trust you .
you know , start telling you things you want to know .
after a while , you pull down a big confession .
i got some bumps up .
hey .
how long do you think ... ?
how long you suppose a woman needs to know a guy ... ... before she' il get engaged to him ?
shortest amount of time .
come on , malloy .
how long ?
oh , i don' t know .
i guess it depends .
it took my mother about a half hour .
you' re kidding me ?
no .
what' d your father do ?
romance her to fall in love ?
put a gun to her head ?
how' d that happen ?
yeah .
yeah .
o what can ail thee , knight at arms alone and palely loitering ?
the sedge has withered from the lake , and no birds sing
what' s " sedge " ?
ferns .
this looks like a place where they dump bodies .
what' s in these bags ?
garbage .
go on , try it .
no .
i' m frightened of guns .
why don' t you learn to use one .
go on .
go on .
how do you hold this thing ?
do you ?
one hand or two ?
hold it any way you want .
just don' t hold it this way .
again .
you have to hold it with two hands .
yeah .
try aiming this time .
try .
go on .
try .
cheap piece of shit .
let' s see what good kissers we are .
we already kissed .
no , not really .
come on , miss lsthmus .
you used to do this when you were a kid ?
i went to boarding school .
you' re here for the sex , right ?
you don' t go nowhere with me , i didn' t fuck you .
yeah , all right .
would you get engaged to me ?
ls this about the murder ?
no .
yeah , i can' t get the sick fuck out of my head .
while we were kissing ?
all the fucking time .
so do you want to stop by my place ?
yeah .
i gotta tell you , i' m going away for a while .
probably not gonna be able to talk to you for a little bit .
where are you going ?

ls your wife going ?
my ex wife ?
yeah .
no , your wife .
get the fuck out of here .
i sleep on the fucking couch .

it' s complicated .
i didn' t have money to get an apartment ... ... so i went to live with my mother .
she' s worse than my wife .
three years ago i moved back .
we don' t sleep together .
i moved back for my kids , okay ?
she can' t control my kids .
do you ever tell the truth ?
where you going ?
i' il give you a ride home .
hey !
something wrong ?
how did you get in ?
i hope you don' t mind .
i took a shower .
you know , you might want to check your messages .
that student of yours has been taken in for questioning .
the police found his term paper illustrated in blood .
that' s a little weird , isn' t it ?
you want some tea ?
i have to go out .
actually , the real reason that i' m here is because ... ... i thought i should tell you that i' m gonna call pauline and ask her out .
really ?
did i ever tell you that my mother ... ... used to dress me in girls ' blouses ?
yes , i think you did .
so do you think it' s a good idea ?
what ?
about pauline .
i think it' s a good idea , but , you know ....
then again , i hardly know her at all .
i don' t think pauline will sleep with you , if that' s what you' re thinking .
you' re right .
you' re right .
what ?
what am i thinking ?
she' s worse than you are .
have sex with me ?
i must be out of my fucking mind .
will you have sex with me ?
shit !
i' m out of my fucking mind .
will you have sex with me ?
now
thinking back on the course of my passion
i was like one blind unafraid of the dark
have you seen pauline ?
no .
she hasn' t come in tonight ?
no , she hasn' t , but ... ... just let me check , okay ?
have you seen pauline ?
no .
myself , i hate to drink alone .
pauline ?
pauline ?

frannie .
frannie .
frannie , it' s malloy .
hon , i gotta take that bag away from you .
i gotta take the bag .
come on .
i know .
i know .
i gotta take it .
hey , jackie .
yeah .
can you get her to 622 on 6th street ?
no problem .
i was at the morgue .
i' m sorry they made you wait .
i told them to let you go home .
i need to ask you some questions about pauline , frannie .
let' s go .
when i was 13 ... ... my father left me in geneva .
he was called away to washington for five days .
he said later that it never occurred to him that i wouldn' t be all right .
pauline said that i failed to take advantage of the situation .
that i should have ordered ... ... hundreds of boxes of chocolate , that i should have made a snowman .
was pauline engaged ?
no .
you recognize this ?
we found it on her left third finger .
no . ls that it ?
ls that his signature ?
yeah , it' s his signature .
i want to know what happened .
i want to know if it was quick .
why do you think knowing' s gonna make a difference , frannie ?
i thought that all my life .
you' re wrong .
knowing don' t mean shit .
" doesn' t " mean shit .
this guy must have known her .
he strangled her ... ... till she lost consciousness , probably in the bedroom ... ... then dragged her into the bathroom and cut her throat .
cut through the windpipe , the jugular , the epiglottis , the hyoid , the tongue .
he held her by her hair and cut all around .
this guy likes blood .
when he got to the vertebrae ... ... he needed a bigger knife to cut through that , and he had one .
he pulled the drain in the sinks before he left ... ... so he left us nothing that could help us .
it scares me that this guy knows about drains .
i' m gonna go back to the apartment .
there' s something i know , but i don' t know it yet .
sometimes it helps just to sit there  how will you get in ?
i got a key .
you have a key ?
yeah .
you have her key ?
i guess so .
i have a key .
did you kill her ?
sgt. lawrence , can you give miss avery a drive home ?
yes .
get the fuck out of here .
