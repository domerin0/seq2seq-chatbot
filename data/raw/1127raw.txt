hey , skinhead ... is he always like this before a tournament ?
who are you calling ' skinhead ' ? !
he' s mad about this morning .
recognize and react !
recognizing takes a tenth of a second !
then you react !
bring that time as close to zero as you can !
no other sport demands the reaction time of table tennis !
tsukimoto' s getting pissed off .
coach keeps stepping on the balls !
there' s another one !
what is this ?
a hot spring ?
shape up or ship out !
he' s pissed off .
another ball !
what' s wrong ?
i' m shipping out .
we just started !
real hot , ain' t it ?
why are you following me ?
you' re going to beat china , right ?
hell , yeah !
so you can' t skip practice any more .
practice like that ?
it' s a total waste of time .
i' ve been really tired lately .
of what ?
tabe tennis relationships ...
life' s getting too complicated .
i' m a simple guy .
all i want is to be the best table tennis player ... ... on the planet !
winning' s everything , right ?
no , it isn' t .
no ?
i don' t like dragging someone down just to win a game .
that' s the cool part .
for me , ping pong is only killing time .
not for me .
yeah , but you' re cool .
i don' t like it when you look bad .
then let' s go back .
i can' t practice without you .
i' il buy you a popsicle .
hurry up , smile !

demon ?
well , if it isn' t peco !
you' re such a shrimp i almost didn' t see you .

dumb ass !
i' m on the varsity !
sakuma !
team meeting !

what ?
for when you start crying .
i' il put a ball right through those glasses , asshole !
i' m going to skunk you , demon !
there he is !

where' s mr kazama ?
he always shuts himself in the can before a match .
diarrhea ?
no .
one day you' il understand .
game , set !
hoshino , katase high school .
thank you , thank you ...
shut up , stupid it' s only the first game !
what does he think he' s doing ?
kong , baby !
show us some kung fu !
hey , china !
china !
china !
hey , fortune cookie !
silence !
to hear you speak ill of him ... ... is repellent .
he' s pissed off .
who the hell do you think you are , egghead ? !
cool it !
huh ?
huh ?
just shut up !
the kaio team is having its meeting , mr kazama .
i want to talk to you .
do you mind ?
i' m going !
wait !
i met your mother at an inter high tournament !
he represented aomori and i represented ehime !
table tennis is in your blood !
i won' t stand by and let you quit !
let go of me !
so what if he' s chinese ?
some black people can' t dance .
what ?
is that true ?
yeah !
and some germans don' t like beer !
your father' s from aomori but he hates apples !
yeah !
shanghai schmanghai !
he' il fall down , go boom !
fall down go boom !
fall down go boom !
fall down go boom !
yes !
how childish !
he didn' t make china' s national team ... ... so he' s trying to start over in japan .
i hate to think how that' d feel .
but he shouldn' t show up someone in front of everybody like that .
how will that guy feel ?
you play your best out of respect for your opponent .
tsukimoto ... ... i hate the way you play ... ... going easy on people out of consideration for them .
it' s patronizing .
if you want to make me mad , you' re succeeding .
you' re not fit to hold a racket .
i hate you .
it' s almost time ...
i' m coming .
where' s the old glass bottle ?
yen200 for this is a rip off !
huh ? !
hey , did you shake this ? !
there' s yen100 gone already !
this sucks !
feel the heat !
game , set .
tsukimoto , katase high school .
you were attacking ...
just for a change .
play your own style .
why ?
i just do this to kill time .
what' s wrong with that ?
i don' t like this play as if it meant your life shit .
you sure sound relaxed .
is that why you weren' t chopping ?
is that a problem ?
maybe .
i' m the guy who plays the attacking game .
oh yeah ?
anyway , it' s not smart to keep changing your game .
are you ok ?
about what ?
demon .
he' s like a different guy from the old days .
don' t you worry bout me .
hey , peco ... ... do you believe in heroes ?
heroes ?
someone who comes to help when you' re in trouble .
they only exist ...
... in comic books .
maybe so .
take this and play to win .
this is my spare .
i changed the rubber .
long pips ...
why bother ?
i' m playing kong .
yes .
not hoshino .
so do me a favor , and don' t hold back .
i don' t need this !
why are you always on my case ?
leave me alone !
mr tsukimoto ... ... let' s make a bet .
you win your match and i get off your back .
and if i lose ?
lose and you' re my dog .
you do everything i say .
there are things you can only see from the very top ... ... mr tsukimoto .
and you' ve been there ?
nothing' s going to change for me , win or lose .
i' m not betting .
you' il lose .
thanks , ' coach ' .
i' m telling the truth .
you' re going to lose .
sure you don' t want to bet , mr tsukimoto ?
if i win , don' t try coaching me ever again .
round 3 !
round 3 !
kong , tsujido academy , and tsukimoto , katase high school .
i want to hear you guys !
the loudest side wins !
if tsujido outshouts us we lose !
go , go , tsukimoto !
push , push , tsukimoto !
shut up !
this is my game .
there' s no point shouting .
what ?
it' s irritating .
dismissed !
yes !
that' s the best you can do ?
you' ve got talent ... ... but you never develop it ...
... here .
yes !
yes !
game !
tsujido , kong !
i knew we should be shouting .
we can' t outshout china .
there' s a billions of them .
second game !
tsukimoto to serve .
love all .
yes !
china was off guard .
he' s reading you !
keep quiet , will you ?
now we' il see the real smile .
now we' il see the real smile .
could we get him into our school ?
china ?
no .
your old buddy .
smile ?
' smile ' ?
they call him that because he never does .
you' re really into this .
it' s half jealousy .
lots of people want real talent ... ... but very few have it .
real talent ?
shit !
it' s over , wenge !
lose this and you' re finished !
ignore him .
you' re not here as a tourist !
they left you off the team , remember ?
this is no time for attitude !
do you hear me ?
yes .
peco ...
he' s still too nice for his own good !
game , set !
kong , tsujido academy .
playing like that is an insult to the game .
don' t do it again !
don' t hit someone with glasses on .
don' t you know that ?
either come to play or quit !
alright .
smile isn' t going to bring you back your youth ... ... ' butterfly joe ' .
tamura ...

but if i win , you call me ' mr ' .
call me mr poco .
owww !
i read your ' comment ' .
kazama wins second title as kaio team upset
' the decline of the team ...
' ... is more important than individual victories . '
' for kaio to recover ...
' ... it needs more players like tsukimoto of katase high ... '
what ?
you' ve gotten slow .
three days off means a week to get your speed back .
how many days have you missed ?
one , two , three , four ... ... five , six , seven ...
get out !
greetings !
i am sakuma manabu , of kaio academy .
i am here to play table tennis against tsukimoto !
aren' t you worried about sakuma ?
he knows non competition games are against club rules .
if he plays one and loses , he' s off the team .
i' il play , but you' il lose .
listen to this !
he' il lose .
what did you say ?
sakuma' s going to lose .
tsukimoto' s in there !

but he' s so cool !
what' s happening ?
yuck !

practice won' t help him !
i don' t care .
21 7 .
game , tsukimoto .
aw , shit !
why ? !
why is it you and not me ? !
i' ve tried !
ten , a hundred , ten thousand times harder than you have !
to impress mr kazama ... to beat peco ...
i' ve lived and breathed table tennis !
so why is it you ? !
you just don' t have the talent .
what ? !
that' s all it is .
it' s nothing to start screaming over .
you can go now .
bye bye .
hey !
where do you think you' re going ?
where do you think you' re going i said !
wherever the hell i want to !
where am i going , huh ?
tell me !
kazama
rise to buddha , old buddy .
home it !
we were just warming up .
i asked for some better balls to practise with , didn' t i ?
oh , yeah ... they' re on order .
you said that last week .
look , we can' t spend the whole club budget on you .
what else are we buying ?
hey wait !
tsukimoto !
there' s peco !
why don' t you come any more ?
come and teach us !
girls don' t go for ping pong players .
there' s a guy there who chops !
a chopper ?
the guy with the glasses .
smile ?
nope .
but an old friend' s an old friend .
there !
gee !
idiot !
that chop wouldn' t cut tofu .
you' re right .
see ?
i' m teaching myself .
i' m totally impressed .
i had to drop out of school but i want to give it my best shot .
but this watch and wait kind of game ... ... just doesn' t suit me .
some birds can' t fly .
keep playing .
you' ve got the gift .
i' m talking about you , peco .
do i know you ?
you' ve got an instinct for the game .
bullshit .
the fact is that you beat me and smile beat you .
so do something about it .
go screw yourself .
there are things only a hack player knows .
i' il say this once .
run till you puke blood .
practise till you piss blood .
you' il feel better .
if you don' t ... ... you' il let down the ones who' ve always admired you ... ... me and smile .
haven' t seen him .
coaching is more than just teaching technique .
aw , shuddup .
it' s trial and error .
i' ve bust my ass over him .
that' s why he took off .
if there' s no love in it , you' d better leave him alone .
young man !
don' t do it , son .
it' s not worth it .
i had a bad day at the track .
all i' ve got is y60 ... ... but i' m not giving up .
what' il your parents think if you die ?
die ?
yeah .
you' il never amount to anything if you' re dead .
i' m not going to die .
no ?
i' m going to fly .
yeah ?
great !
i can touch the moon no problem !
that' s the spirit !
did i make you do that ? !
are you strong ?
... taste iron in blood .
hey , peco ... ... do you believe in heroes ?
you' re still here ?
a coach isn' t a coach ... ... without a player .
next time i' il kick your ass .
now i remember ...
... the one time ...
... that smile smiled .
this isn' t a barber shop .
show me again , will you ?
right from how you grip the racket .
5 : 04 ... no good !
do it again !
granny !
what ?
i said from how you grip the racket , didn' t i ?
yep .
when do i start hitting ?
i' ve been running for two weeks .
until you beat three minutes .
do it again .
nice day .
don' t you have ... ... someone to pack you a lunch on a sunny day like this ?
i' ve got a girlfriend .
just kidding .
you don' t have to be surprised like that .
wanna go out ?
tsukimoto !
hey , tsukimoto !
hi !
isn' t this fun , mr tsukimoto ?
are you having fun ?
if you' re having fun , smile !
i would if i was .
you would , huh ?
damn right !
stop puking !
you' il hurt my feelings !
i' m your honey !
get up here and put your arms around me .
stop puking !
butterfly joe ?
yep .
30 years ago , he was one of the best .
was he really good ?
not just good .
he was beautiful to watch .
no one could touch him .
he was the king of japanese table tennis .
he was a shoo in for the national team ...
but ... ... i had a friend i' d hit against ever since i could remember .
he was really good ... ... but if we were both in good shape ... ... i' d beat him .
a knee injury ...
they said to take six months off .
so you defaulted ?
i would have .
but it was my friend who had the bad knee .
i don' t get it .
you could' ve played him deep then hit to his backhand .
could you do that ?
would you take advantage of a friend' s injury ... ... and risk ending his career ?
could you do that ?
that was my last game .
let' s go .
coach ... ... i' ve always wanted to ride that thing .
well ?
did i do it ?
i did ?
i didn' t ?
back to the dojo !
i did it !
three minutes !
am i awesome or what !
you' re great .
we make a great couple !
i love you a whole bunch !
here ...
what you' ve been waiting for .
you' re losing it , granny .
there' s rubber on the back , too .
i' m not losing it .
that means you can turn it over to hit .
i thought you' d forgotten .
we' d just come to the end of last year' s budget .
plus i didn' t know where to order them .
will you hit against me for a bit ?
you' d better ask coach koizumi .
the inter high' s getting close .
i' il go easy .
these are good .
it' s not the same .
now for some spin ...
damn !
that' s enough !
no !
tsukimoto !
shouldn' t you be warming up ?
is he listening ?
is he listening ?
you' il be late !
who' s my first game ?
don' t leave on me when you find out .
why do i have to draw china first ?
i seriously want to go home !
i' m not losing it .
placement , control , speed ... ... tsukimoto' s in another league .
hmm ?
oh , kong wenge ...
he' s gotten better this year , too .
he' s headed for the top .
i wonder ...
he could lose here .
16 20 .
yes !
alright !
you remember ?
the first time we played , you didn' t win a point .
thanks , kong .
i learned something from you .
you taught me how to fly .
there !
the back side !
game !
hoshino !
that' s my boy !
check it out , china .
you might catch me in 300 years !
hey !
you' re in a game .
sorry .
get a move on , will you ? !
hurry up , muko , or i' il leave you here !
hey , manabu ... there' s a swimming tournament , too .
you can go jump in with them , then .
what' s the matter ?
i just said there' s swimming .
swimmers have meets , not tournaments !
i should' ve gone to europe .
sweden , or germany ...
but i chose japan ...
say hello to kazama .
hoshino kong
i could cry ...
what ?
did your friend win ?
hello , mr kazama .
it' s sakuma .
sakuma manabu .
i' m not going to let you ... ... show up my school !
how have you been , sakuma ?
what ?
i' m doing alright .
mr sanada never quits , does he ?
if there' s one guy he doesn' t want to lose to , it' s tsukimoto .
sakuma ... ... competition is there to show who' s best .
if you say so .
it doesn' t matter who says so .
now that i' ve quit table tennis , i finally understand ...
... why you shut yourself away in here .
funny , huh ?
who do you play for anyway ?
myself , of course .
you' re kidding , of course .
if you mean that ... ... i was wasting my time .
be seeing you .
sakuma !
do you feel betrayed ?
i sympathize .
what' s the matter ?
have you got diarrhea ?
there' s more than diarrhea that drives a man to the toilet .
what do you mean ?
stay there .
i need to cry a little .
game , set !
hoshino , katase high school .
semi final round
game , set !
tsukimoto , katase high school .
you' re in the final !
way to go , smile !
uh ... ' tsukimoto ' .
where' s peco ?
in the medical room .
his knee' s pretty bad .
aren' t you worried about him ?
the man' s a machine !
i like it ... how cool he is .
no problem , baby .
check it out .
i had it retaped , and i got a shot of pain killer .
you don' t know what a bad knee can do .
excuse me ... it' s time for your semi final .
i' m coming .
no , he' s not .
listen , peco ...
i know how bad you want to play kazama .
but if you want to be the best in the world someday ... ... you' ve got to have the guts to raise the white flag .
smile' s calling me .
he' s been waiting for a long time .
for ages and ages ... ... he' s believed in me .
i knew it , but i pretended i didn' t .
it scared me .
i covered my ears against it .
but he' s waiting for me .
peco ...
... i love you , kid .
stand back !
stand back !
competitor coming through !
stand back , stand back !
there' s a player coming through .
do you believe in heroes ?
heroes ?
you ok ?
your knee ...
i don' t know if it' il hold up .
but you' re a high flier .
way high up there .
so i' il just climb your back , stand on your shoulders and ... ... fly .
a hero shows up in the clutch ... ... and saves me , no matter how deep a hole i' m in .
that' s a hero .
here goes !
after i beat you , go out and get ... ... a haircut .
go get some hair .
i really need to take a piss !
he jumped over to his backhand .
he won' t admit that hoshino' s good .
amazing !
nice shot .
but ... ... you won' t be there forever looking down at everyone .
' enter the hero . '
i' m the hero .
it' s me .
he comes back .
my name is ... ... hoshino ... ... yutaka !
remember that !
remember that !
15 2 .
what' s wrong ... ... ' hero ' ?
what' s wrong ?
aren' t you the hero ?
can' t you fly ? !
