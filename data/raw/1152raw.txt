how you doing ?
what' s up ?
what' s up ?
what' s up ?
what you are watching is live footage of a vehicle , apparently stolen , being pursued by police .
we' re receiving word now that the driver of that vehicle is former pittsburgh football star paul crewe .
crewe , you might remember , was the only man ever to be indicted on federal racketeering charges for shaving points in a professional football game , although it was never fully proven .
yeah !
heilo .
do not get one more scratch on my car , or i wiii slit your throat .
see , that' s our problem , sweetie .
you care about this car more than you do us .
and how' d you even know there was a scratch on this baby ?
because i am watching you on tv , as is the whole country .
once again , you are proving to everyone what a worthless piece of shit you are .
weil , i hope they iike this .
hey , lena !
l think we should start seeing other people !
i think i' m in iove .
good news , boys , i didn' t spiii my beer .
without question , crewe' s five year federal probation for point shaving has been severely violated tonight .
the future of this once great football star looks very dark indeed .
long way from the big city , huh , superstar ?
staying with the times around here , huh ?
ain' t she beautiful ?
home sweet home , boy .
get on your feet .
you' re one iucky son of a bitch , crewe .
is that right ?
that' s right .
see , the warden ioves his footbail .
fact , he was on the winning side of your iittle thing .
weil , teii him congratulations .
but i wasn' t .
welcome to ailenviile .
thank you , sergeant .
i' ii take it from here .
afternoon , inmate crewe .
yeah .
come on .
warden wants to see you .
let' s do it .
move it .
i used to play a iittle coilege baii myself .
down at the university of miami .
i bet a iot of your old teammates are iocked up in here .
no inmates from my playing days .
couple of guards , though .
see , we got us a fine prison guard ieague down here .
it' s iike a company softbaii team .
now , the warden ... ... he' s gonna ask you to help out .
okay .
with what ?
that wasn' t nice .
when the warden asks you , what are you gonna say ?
yes ?
you' re gonna teii him " no .
you got it ?
you' re gonna teii the warden that you want nothing to do with his footbaii fantasies .
not in my back yard .
because the warden don' t run this prison .
i do .
you understand ?
not entirely .
okay .
i feei you , dog .
i feei you .
paui " wrecking " crewe .
i don' t get to say this to my new guests very often , but it' s an honor to have you here at this institution .
it' s an honor to be iocked up here , sir .
oh , weil , this is erroi dandridge .
colonei sanders been eating his own chicken .
he' s my politicai adviser .
see , i' ve been approached by severai very influentiai people wondering if i' d be interested in standing for governor .
they see the way i run this prison , think maybe i should run this state .
only with iess sodomy , right ?
hopefuily none .
sorry .
now , there are two things we take very seriously here in the state of texas .
prison and footbail .
we play a iittle of the iatter here .
the warden is too modest to admit that his team is rather good .
but not good enough .
five years since our iast championship .
five years .
now , i' ve worked reai hard , puiled strings , cailed in quite a few favors to get you here , paul .
now , why would you go and do that ?
because i am convinced that you can get us back on track .
i haven' t played footbaii in i don' t know how iong .
i don' t reaily want to .
you wouldn' t be playing , paul .
just consulting .
anyone who was once the mvp of the nationai footbaii league must have a great deai of expertise to offer .
captain , what would you say to mr. crewe iooking in , giving us the benefit of his experience ?
i think that' s a reai good idea , warden .
we can use aii the help we can get .
weil , then , it' s aii settled .
what you say , paul ?
i appreciate the offer , but i' m gonna have to pass .
now , i can assure you that your time here wiii be a whole iot easier if you just participate .
i just wanna do my time and go home .
nothing else .
if you' ii excuse us , mr. crewe .
captain knauer , you can stay .
sit down !
i used to love your underwear commercials .
thank you very much .
my ex husband wore the same brand of tighty whities .
he didn' t fiii them out quite as weii as you , though .
speciai effects .
hoilywood .
not aii me .
oh , i doubt that very seriously .
weil , then get him enthusiastic , damn it !
come on , get up .
how' d it go in there ?
we aii set now ?
oh , yeah , we' re reai tight .
only the finest for you , superstar .
i was just playing .
i ain' t gonna forget you , crewe .
hey , yo , you owe me money on that game , punk !
better watch yourself , mr. footbail !
bitch !
yeah , you better run , woman .
yo , footbail .
take a seat .
thanks .
you know , i have never seen one inmate just walk in here and be unanimously hated by the entire population .
i ain' t never seen it .
how' d i get so iucky ?
you could have robbed banks , sold crack , stole your grandmama' s pension , and nobody would have cared .
but shaving points off a footbaii game ?
man , that' s just un american .
you play footbail ?
me ?
no .
i suck so bad , they used to pick me after the white kids .
used to be mad too .
it' s iike , " i can' t believe i picked a nigga that can' t play .
caretaker .
paui crewe .
whatever your pleasure , i can facilitate .
you need weed , you need meth hey , you need prozac , i' m your man .
i know how you white boys always deai with that depression .
i mean , me personaily , i don' t understand what you white boys aii depressed about .
hey , you' re white .
smile .
and for a smaii fee , i can even get you mcdonald' s .
reaily ?
yeah , that' s right .
mickey d' s .
my man cheeseburger eddy got the hookup .
cheeseburger eddy ?
that' s right .
we can get our mcflurry on .
enjoy it , fat man .
what about the love of a beautifui woman ?
weil , you' re gonna have to iower your standards on the beautifui part and on the woman part .
hey .
let' s just stick with the cheeseburgers .
oh , they ugly now , but in eight months , he gonna iook iike beyonc .
no , thanks .
now , here' s the most important part .
you can' t iet these guys scare you .
you can' t iet them punk you .
because if you do that , you gonna end up being somebody' s bitch .
don' t want that .
thanks for the advice .
hey .
let me take that tray out for you .
i ain' t done eating yet .
oh , you' re not ?
i' ii give it back to you , then .
you' re dead !
hornet' s nest !
everybody stay down .
stay quiet !
come on , crewe , get up .
get up , superstar .
yes , sir .
you think you can do anything you want around here , don' t you ?
weil , you are no different than any other piece of shit that cails this place home .
reaily ?
these guys think you' re a dumb redneck too ?
girl , that' s your new boo .
you better cut that shit out .
it' s getting old .
that' s gonna cost you .
looking forward to it .
wake up , sleeping beauty .
hey , superdick .
warden' s wondering if your stay in the hotbox has changed your mind .
how iong have i been in here ?
one week .
wanna go for two ?
how' d you find these guys anyways ?
recruitment , boy .
when coilege stars don' t get drafted , they need a place to go .
a job , money , security .
who drank aii the damn gatorade ? !
damn it !
and apparently steroids .
look , seems iike you got aii the talent you' d want .
so why do you need me ?
weil , now , you might find this hard to believe , but there' s folks here in the prison ieague don' t care for me very much .
you , warden ?
they thought it might be amusing to schedule the defending ieague champs as our first game .
and me ?
weil , i thought an old pro iike yourself might have some training camp tricks , driils , insights to offer up .
give us the competitive edge .
aii right .
relatively simple .
you need a tune up game .
a tune up game ?
yeah .
in coilege , we' d start every season against appalachian state or some slack division ii team .
kick the iiving shit out of them .
get their confidence up .
you know something , paul ?
you' ve just given me an inspiration .
that' s great .
what ?
you' re gonna assemble a team to play the first game against us .
and you , mr. crewe , are gonna be the quarterback .
i don' t think so .
let me teii you something .
in my prison , to get along , you gotta go along .
i just wanna do my three years and be done .
three years is before you assaulted captain knauer .
now , you could be with us for a very iong time , mr. crewe .
fine , i' ii do it .
good choice .
but one condition , though .
gotta promise me to keep captain knauer off my back .
it' s a deal .
now , you got four weeks to assemble a team and train them .
what , are we gonna have a half hour a day to practice with a nerf bail ?
oh , i' ii make sure my boys ailow you sufficient freedom , within these wails , to get your team in shape .
what' s this ?
footbaii ' tree outs . " '
what the heii is a " tree out " ?
tryout , " you half a meatbail .
what' s this footbaii thing about , man ?
crewe' s getting a team together .
to play against who ?
the guards .
now , i don' t know about y' ail , but i occasionaily have the impulse to physicaily assault one of our finer correctionai officers .
yeah ?
weil , how the heii we gonna get to do that ?
just show up at the " tree outs , " you big , dumb bitch .
do the girls get to play ?
we' re playing footbails , not bails bails .
this is builshit .
just another chance for the guards to beat on us .
don' t you idiots get it ?
we could get a free shot at the guards .
this is our turn .
we could beat up on them .
we could kiii them .
kiii them .
you know mvp sold his own teammates out .
what do you think he' s gonna do to you fools ?
and that' s the truth .
with some cheese on it .
there ain' t no meat ioaf between these buns .

how are we gonna find players ?
how' d they get you to go to florida state ?
they recruited me .
i' ii get the strippers .
