being a policeman is not what you see on tv .

i set it up to make it look like i was . . . .
i was auditioning to get this part .

and he touches it , gently , on his tongue .
watch the eyebrows .
hooker knows it' s cocaine .

uncle reggie .
yeah .
my uncle
uncle reggie passed away two years ago .
he got caught in the line of some fire .
didn' t slow me down .
i remember how he set me on my way .
he' s looking down on me from a big precinct in the sky .
he' s thinking , " you' ve done all right , trey .
you' ve done right by me .
that " i' m your partner . " that was a speech .
you burned up 90 seconds of air .
that was a speech .
when we get to the crime scene , stay out of my way .
this isn' t studio shit .
this is real .
get your camera out of here .
hey , watch it .
julio has to shoot .

whoever shot him didn' t care for open caskets .
thinking what i' m thinking ?
. . . cleaning the streets up on they own terms , partner .
this is payback for a drug deal gone sour .
whoever this guy worked for got pissed .
good thinking , partner .
good thinking .
i think i can identify one of the victims .
those are 1 2 gauge , armor piercing uranium shells .
charlie .
hey , mitchell .

it appears to be hand held , automatic , with interchangeable magazines .
technically , this gun doesn' t exist .

it' s out of eastern europe .
thanks , charlie .
keep your eyes open .
you bet .

what' s going on ?
he' s contaminating my crime scene .
i' m doing a sweep of the area .
you never know where a crucial bit of evidence may be hiding .
did anybody think to pull some prints off this water bottle ?
can i get an evidence bag ?
that' s an honest mistake . evidence so i thought it was ...
hey , t. j. , go solve the case somewhere else .
don' t give me orders , i' m your partner !
no , i partner with real cops .
get me a copy of that report .
all right , mitch .
well , i am your partner , so you better accept that .
i am your partner !
he won' t open up .
you know how hard it is to work with somebody like that ?
i know .
mitch has been a lot more resistant than i' d hoped for .
i think that you and mitch need some bonding time .
you' re right .
we do .
we need some qt time together .
two guys hanging out , have some beers .
i' il call to see if he wants to hang out .
let' s not call him .

not a stinky smell , an odd one .
what is that smell ?

what' s the problem ?
like a trailer on the beach or a loft downtown .
that kind of thing .
your research shows that , huh ?
where does he live ?
i rent a guesthouse from a producer .
kind of gives off a magnum vibe .
totally .
it' s unique .
you know what , mitch ?
we can make this work .
did a crackhead make this cup ?
no .
it' s just .
the point is to let the audience in on all aspects of your life .
mitch , i think you need some time away from the job .
i just found the crackhead' s shop .
hey , don' t go in there .
this is what you smell all over the place .

we' ve provided a chair .
all you have to do is sit and share .
share ?
learn how to turn on your heart light .
exactly .
chase !
brad loves the promo footage .
you need a catch phrase ?
i got it .
when i' m about to make a bust  when did you ever make a bust ?
to get in the moment ... . . . l take three deep breaths and say to myself , " okay , trey , it' s showtime !
