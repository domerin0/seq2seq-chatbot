i walk home ...
i' m aii scratched up , i' ve got blood aii over my face ...
i' m crying my eyes out .
my mother sees me and she runs up screaming , " who did this to you ?
i teii her , " stevie beilon jumped me from behind in the schooi yard ... while his pals stood there and made sure no one broke it up .
so take a guess what my mom does ?
she takes me back to the schooi yard ... she finds stevie and teils him that i' m gonna fight him again ... only this time it' s gonna be affairfight .
your mom booked yourfight .
weil , me and stevie , we stood there iooking at her ...
iike she was waiting for us to make up or something .
then she puils me aside and iooks at me ... and teils me to rip his heart out .
she said , " rip his heart out " to an eight year old ?
and ?
and i got him pretty good .
your mother just stood there and watched ?
once things were evened up , she puiled me off of him .
good foryour mom .
i salute her .
if more parents took those steps during child developmentai years ... we wouldn' t have a country fiiled of emotionai cripples ... those touchy feely , angst ing head cases afraid of their own shadows .

it' s cold outside .
i think it' s time for a cab home .

james eari jones ?
while some poor slob was sweating his ass off underthe costume .
afew months iater , he throws his voice and walks out with a check .
you' re a cook in a restaurant , right ?
i wondered if you' d been invited to any james eari jones ' pooi parties .
i may not be in the movie business ... but i have cable .

i' m not sore .
don' t worry , tom .
i' m gonna do whatever it takes not to iet this siily i. q. thing ... get in the way of our new friendship , aii right ?
people can be cruel ... to people inteilectuaily chailenged , such as yourself .
i don' t know your daily struggles ...
iike trying to figure out which shoe goes on which foot .
aii right .
you give ?
i give .
you give ?
i give .
you give up too easy .
i was being nice .
i didn' t want you to feei inadequate afterthe mentai bashing i gave you .
you know , how much can one person take in one night ?
thank you forthe compassion .
it' s my fatai flaw .
compassion ?
ijust can' t stop giving .
and that' s a flaw ?
weil , people can take advantage of ...
you have reaily beautifui eyes .
i need a ...
i want a drink .
do you want a drink ?
i' ve got some scotch .
drink ?
i' ve got beer .
do you want a beer ?
do you have a boyfriend ?
no , i have beer .
do you have a girlfriend ?
no , i don' t .
shit , you' re married .
no , i' m not married .
so what' s the problem ?
what do you mean , there' s no problem .
you didn' t just notice the sudden change of subject occur ?
can we just talk some more ?
talk .
ijust ... i need a few more minutes with this .
have you ever been with a guy before ?
teii the truth .
i am .
it' s totaily cooi if you haven' t .
weil , i have .
it' s actuaily sort of a turn on if you haven' t .
weil , i have .
i' m a iittle nervous .
so am i.
you' re nervous .
i' m serious .
i may be a iittle slow with aii this ... you don' t come off as a rookie to me .
look ...
i can' t ever remember making a move iike that .
i' m usuaily " a big scared cat " , seriously .
you don' t seem it .
weil , i guess i' m good at hiding it , then .
you are .
weil , it' s just you' re easy to be with , you now ?
that doesn' t happen every day .
i guess i kind of went with it .
i got a sudden burst of courage , that' s now quickly disappearing .
so you don' t mind if we talk for a iittle while ?
that' d be great .
i' m gonna get us a couple drinks .
how iong have you iived here ?
i iike your place .
it' s funky .
can i ask you something ?
what ?
i don' t want to say anything you might take the wrong way .
what is it ?
how many men have you been with ?
just teii me it' s none of my fuckin ' business .
it' s none of yourfucking business .
right .
i' m playing with you .
relax .
so , how many men have you been with ?
weil , not a iot .
how many is " not a iot " ?
whatever most people today consider a iot , it' s iess than that .
less than a iot .
what about more than messing around ?
sex is a very intimate thing .
it' s the most intimate two people can be with one another .
and it' s not something i feei right about with just anybody .
there has to be a certain trust a certain bond with that person .
nice observation .
yeah , it is for me .
i' m starting to think that because i made some siily move ... you now have this idea about me ?
maybe i misread things .
maybe .
maybe .
so how many men have you been with ?
ijust told you .
no , no .
you said you needed trust .
you said " trust " .
doesn' t that say it ail ?
not reaily .
i know the exact number of men i' ve been with .
most people don' t orthey can' t keep track , but i do .
if you don' t want to teii me , or ...
six .
six , just iike that .
six , just iike that .
we are talking about intercourse ?
okay , weil , then , six .
no way it could be seven ?
is it possible there is seven ?
i guess , but no more than seven .
no way .
it could be seven but not a chance there' s eight ?
what is this ?
isn' t this usuaily done by a guy named " rocco " ... with a hot iamp in my eyes ?
i' m sorry .
i' m sorry .
i' m getting aii carried away .
this is your personai business .
i' m being an asshole .
give me one second ... and i' ii teii you precisely how many men i' ve done that with .
seven .
seven .
exactly seven .
how' s that , " lieutenant columbo " ?
what about you ?
one .
one ?
reaily ?
so , what was it , a one night stand , a good close friend ?
do you screw aii eight of them or did they screw you ?
you' re being siily and i told you it was seven and not eight .
we don' t have to play this twenty questions game .
if you want to know if i' m safe just ask me .
are you safe ?
very .
that' s a strong word .
the simple truth is , i don' t ever do anything that' s unsafe .
the truth isn' t that easy .
the truth is confusing .
weil , what' s so confusing about it ?
everybody has their own truth .
and you got yours , i' ve got mine .
but the only truth that matter is the " true truth " .
not what you say ... or what i say but what reaily is .
sometimes it isn' t easy to figure out .
what was the truth foryou , what ijust did there ?
you took a drink from the bottle .
and that would be a iie .
i took the bottle to my iips but i didn' t drink anything .
see , the truth is confusing .
i think the " true truth " is , you' re bombed .
i think we' ve done enough talking fortonight .
you' re gonna take advantage of my drunken state ?
is that what you want ?
i definitely have to get drunk or i wouldn' t be able to do this .
you don' t have to do anything you don' t want to do .
what is it you want ?
i want ...
i need to take a piss .
stay right there , okay ?
you' re very iucky .
why is that ?
if i wasn' t so horny , i would have been out that doorten minutes ago .
i' m totaily kidding .
no , you' re not .
you' re right , i' m not .
heilo , my iove .
you' re stiii awake .
i caught my second wind .
you' re up reai iate for a schooi night .
hey , did you try and ieave a message ?
it doesn' t sound iike you' re stiii at winston' s .
isabeila , don' t give me a hard time .

yes , the cutey .
is he cute rich guy ?

yeah , nine , i got it .

this frog ... it' s cracked .
so ?
i broke it .
i broke this .
i knew this place seemed familiar .
wait a second ...
ijust wasn' t sure .
it was dark and i think ...
i was stoned or something ...
you were drunk , dan .
you weren' t stoned .
how do you know ?
don' t teii me that was you .
was that you ?
yeah .
oh , my god , that was you .
wasn' t that , fouryears ago ?
five .
weil , i didn' t even ...
so , how have you been ?
when did you know that it was me ?
the moment i saw you .
the moment you saw me .
and you didn' t say anything .
i wanted to see if you' d remember me .
i mean , it was five years .
and you were drunk .
i was very drunk .
you don' t remember anything ?
i remember breaking the frog .
what about us ?
weil , i remember we ... we had a good time , we had fun .
fun ?
yeah , we had a iot of fun .
so you don' t remember anything ?
no , ijust ... don' t say that , you know ?
it' s aii right .
no , wait a second .
we met at winston' s , iike we did tonight , right ?
i got it now .
we came back here ... we sat down on the couch and i unbuttoned your shirt .
and then we started kissing ...
i had a puilover , no buttons .
same thing .
teii me more .
more what ?
details .
our details .
teii me everything you remember about our night .
why ?
i iike hearing it .
start with my shirt .
it came off and then what ?
i took off your shirt and i kissed down the back of your ear .
no , that never happened .
excuse me ?
that never happened .
you kissed the back of my ear ...
it was five years ago .
who can remember every detail ?
i can .
i remember every minute .
you didn' t break that thing , i did .
i broke it ... when i was taking off my sweater my blue , striped sweater .
i don' t know what to say .
i' m sorry .
i' m sorry , i don' t remember .
and now i' m realizing it was yourfirst time ...
my only time .
i must reaily iike you ... to have gone home a second time without remembering .
this isn' t gonna happen tonight .
i should probably go .
i reaily sorry .
it' s not opening .
you need a key .
what ?
you need a key .
thanks .
wait a second .
i' m just curious about one thing .
i' m not curious , i' m confused .
about what ?
i don' t know how to put this .
just put it .
if you don' t remember that night ... then why did you teii me you were safe ?
i' m sorry , " very safe " .
open the door .
answer me .
open the door .
i wiil .
open the door now .
just teii me why you said that .
because i' m always safe .
but you don' t remember .
you said , " i don' t remember " .
i said i don' t remember every detail ...
i don' t have to remember being safe .
i' m always safe .
always .
always .
now is that the " true truth " or is that yourtruth ?
god damn it !
they don' t work !
these don' t fuckin ' work , man !
shit .
i gave you the wrong set .
i' m sorry .
i screwed this up .
i didn' t mean to get weird .
it' s just when you didn' t remember me ... that being my only time ...
i got embarrassed .
maybe even a iittle pissed off with the booze .
the booze has a way of being an asshole when i' m hurt .
just open the door , okay ?
can i have a hug before you go ?
i should ieave .
just one hug so there' s no bad feelings .
i should ieave .
i didn' t mean to get weird .
unlock the doorfirst .
you should have ieft .
why didn' t you just ieave ?
the door has a dead bolt which i iocked from the outside .
the windows are boarded up .
the next door neighbors are aii away with the family .
the apartment downstairs is empty .
if you fight me , it wiii hurt .
stay stiil .
try and stay stiil .
is there a problem ?
is there something burning in there ?
i overcooked a steak .
it' s aii right .
ijust need to open a window .
it' s aii right .
you' re sure ?
yeah , it' s fine , thank you .
thanks forthe concern .
i' m not crazy .
i know what i did and i know why i' m doing it .
i want you to know that .
i' m not crazy .
i don' t care why you did what you did ... what you gotta do right now is iet me go .
my roommate knows where i am .
remember isabeila from the bar ?
when i was getting the messages , she picked up .
i told heryou iived on ninth and monroe .
now , when i don' t come home tonight ... and i miss my very important meeting in the morning ... she' s gonna wonder where i am , she' s gonna knocking on your door .
there' s a big difference between teiling her i iive on ninth street ... and teiling her i iive at 453 east ninth street .
i told her453 ninth street .
i mead a mentai note when we walked inside the building .
four five three .
she knows exactly where i am .
you should start writing things down .
we' re in building 412 .
what do you want ?
dan , have you ever been tested forthe alds virus ?
what ?
hlv , alds , you' ve heard of it ?
of course .
have you ever been tested ?
have you ever been tested ?
as you know .
are you ... ?
i' m positive and you gave it to me .
i knew it' d be iike this .
you say " no " , i say " yes " , which ieaves us in the same place .
the blood i took is being tested at a very reliable iab .
we' ii have the result the morning after next and we wiii go from there .
go from there ?
if it' s negative , then i' m sorry , and i wiii iet you go .
you' re sorry ?
this wasn' t an easy decision .
it' s not even a decision .
it' s a way to set things right .
weil , i' ve been tested and it was negative .
when ?
two months ago .
i' ve been tested three times in the iast five years .
that' s a iot of tests .
i told you , i' m very safe .
it is what you told me .
it couldn' t have been me .
this isn' t something you can talk your way out of , act aii smug .
caii my doctor .
you ask him .
i can' t give you something that i don' t have .
i can' t give you something i don' t have !
if your doctortold me that you were negative ...
i would teii him to go fuck himself !
we' re waiting on the iab !
i' m compassionate to your situation , but i don' t have alds .
i don' t have hlv .
then you' ii be out of here soon .
soon enough isn' t good enough .
i want out of here now !
now !
shut up fucking now or i' ii cut yourthroat right fucking now !
you understand me ?
i could be a reai fuck and did one of those do it yourself hlvtests ... but you deserved something more dependable than a ten doilar kit .
do you realize the ionger you keep me here ... it' s just making it worse on yourself ?
do you realize that ?
now you' ve got me worried .
this isn' t right .
tough to be held accountable , isn' t it ?
held accountable ?
we fooled around 5 years ago .
what do i have to be held for ?
you teii me .
you couldn' t teii me earlier what we did .
maybe you could teii me now ?
you' ve got no idea , do you ?
you have no idea what we did or what we didn' t do .
weii you' re responsible for what you did .
you' ve got no clue .
i may not remember what color your goddamn shirt was ... but one thing i am certain about is that i wore a condom .
you were blind drunk .
you have no recoilection of me , but somehow you remember a condom ?
i don' t have to remember wearing it .
i always wear one .
you iie with such confidence .
i' m impressed .
but i' m not iying , am i ?
am i ?
yes , there was a condom .
you had one .
did you use it ?
given the circumstance , i' m guessing you didn' t .
where the fuck where are you getting this ?
maybe it didn' t feei good so you slipped it off halfway through ?
maybe at the iast minute you decided not to put it on ?
i would never do that .
never .
how you would neverfuck anyone without having that certain trust .
and why do we need that trust ?
you never " feei right about doing an intimate thing with just anyone " .
that was you who said that .
i wore a condom .
end of story .
weil , considering one of us is hlv positive ... and the other is having a great deai of difficulty remembering ... the iast iie they told two minutes ago ...
i got serious doubts about where that rubber ended up ... and serious doubts about you .
you tie up aii the other guys you' ve been with ?
there were no other guys .
women ?
you don' t think you can get this from a woman ?
you think the only people who have this disease are gay men ?
wait a second !
you got this from a woman .
you got this from a woman , now you' re trying to blame me for it !
you are sitting there because you are the only possible reason ... why i am here doing this .
the only reason .
i want to see some proof .
you want to see some proof .
what the fuck are you talking about ?
they gave you something to teii you that you got it .
didn' t they ?
they don' t give a membership card .
i' m starting to think you don' t have shit .
you made this alds story up .
and why would i do that ?
because you' re pissed because i fucked you ... because you iike men ... orthat maybe this turns you on , is that it ?
or maybe you' re just fucking crazy ?
you want to know something ?
i wish you were right .
i wish it would end tomorrow .
and i' m not here to torture you .
i don' t want to make this any worse than it has to be .
you can pass the blame around forever but we don' t have forever .
we need to do the right thing .
what is that ?
what is it ?
is that you ?
when the heii did that happen ?
about four hours ago .
why didn' t you wake me up ?
believe me , i tried .
you' re a deep sleeper .
weil , once is not enough .
it' s no wonder who could hear anything overthat incessant snore .
i have a deviated septum .
my snoring is a medicai condition .
whatever .
you know what , can we just ... can we take care of this ?
it' s been a iong night .
just give me a wash cloth and some clean clothes .
no , i can' t do that .
you can' t ?
no , i can' t take the cuffs off .
i' ii be five minutes .
no , i can' t do it .
what is this " can' t " business ?
the cuffs stay on !
i' m asking for a wash cloth , not a gun .
i' m sitting in shit .
i' ii figure something out .
what' s there to figure ?
are you gonna do it ?
no , i' m not gonna do it .
if you' re not gonna do it and i can' t do it with hand cuffs on ... that doesn' t ieave us with a iot of options , does it ?
give me a second .
you should have had this covered .
weil , take points off .
it' s not my career !
what , did you expect me to hold it aii night ?
you take someone hostage and their bodily functions just stop ?
sure , you thought of the tape and the hand cuffs ...
and the board on the window ...
shut up , shut up .
i wiii take off the cuffs , you don' t move .
i take off the cuffs , you don' t move .
you want to ieave the toilet in there ?
i step outside the bathroom and i shut the door , you don' t move .
you don' t move unless i say move , you understand ?
i got it .
put your dirty clothes in the garbage bag ... you take a shower , you towei off ...
how' s it going in there ?
put on your clean clothes .
you take your chair and you put it in the tub .
you iie face down on the floor with your hands behind your back .
again , you do not move .
i wiii come to you ...
i wiii cuff you and i wiii take you out .
you' re iying face down , on the floor with your hands on your back .
now , i' ve never been in your situation before .
it wiii be impossible foryou not to think of a way out of this .
and i understand that .
it' s human nature .
but it' s acting on these thoughts that wiii iead to trouble .
are you on the floor ?
is yourface down ?
and your hands ?
on my back .
you' re iying face down on the floor with your hands on your back ?
teii me where the keys are .
where' s the fuckin ' keys ?
pocket , rear pocket .
it' s done , it' s finished .
move aside .
move !
i' ii fucking kiii you if i have to .
i have a fucking knife , tom .
aii right , you' re gonna die .
i' m gonna drive this right through you .
is that what you want ?
is that what you want , you want to die ?
i' m gonna drive this thing through yourfuckin ' heart .
how many years you thought i was gonna make today ?
lunch smeils good .
what are we having ?
come on , are you stiii mad at me ?
i' m a hostage .
you gotta expect that sort of behaviorfrom us .
what do you expect me to do ?
what would you have done ?
you don' t have to hold a grudge over it .
also considerthat i could have strangled you with the tv cord .
you should be thanking me .
so , did you decorate this place yourself ?
my granddad' s place .
so he iet you use it for speciai occasions .
one night stands , kidnappings ?
he died ten years ago .
the family kept it .
how much do you pay rent ?
trying to watch the game in here .
i' m watching the game .
which team you rooting for ?
you want me to put the tape back on your mouth ?
i was just asking a question , man .
besides , you haven' t fed me yet .
i went to the university of michigan .
we' ve got a great athletic program .
footbail , basebaii and basketbail .
reaily ?
you' re being sarcastic .
what' s michigan' s nickname ?
i' m just gonna take your silence to mean that you ...
wolverines .
wolverines .
what are the team colors ?
blue and yeilow .
wrong .
it' s " maize " .
it' s not yeilow , it' s " maize " .
it' s a pale yeilow .
corn ish " .
so , you' re one of those sports guys .
you know aii the stats .
you think there' s something wrong with that ?
not enough brain space , maybe ?
i' d say it' s enough wasted space that it takes to know ... that teily savalas had a smaii role in the originai " cape fear " .
i was a huge sports fan when i was at michigan .
the best were those saturday afternoon footbaii games .
the whole school , the whole town ... would just get pumped up iike , about three hours before .
we had barbeques in the parking iot ... turning out pep railies .
touch footbaii on the iawn .
i never understood the whole sports thing before i got to ann arbor ... but once i was there , i was hooked .
during the iast year , i actuaily what they were doing on the field . punting , first down conversions ... quarterback snoops ...
sneaks .
it' s " quarterback sneaks " .
it' s completely different when you realize why you' re cheering .
without a doubt the highlight was the iast game , senioryear .
ohio state was driving down the field forthe win ... and everyone was screaming at the top of their iungs ... but it was aii over the place , you know ?
it was iike , a " let' s stop ' em " from this group ... and a " go , wolverines " from that section .
that' s just ... here was no unity .
i stood up , and ijust started yeiling .
defense !
defense !
defense !
i stood there for a iong time before i sit back down .
and then it started .
it was iike a hundred people in my section .
and then it turned into a thousand .
and then it was ...
defense !
defense !
defense !
defense !
a hundred thousand fans screaming at the top of their iungs .
it was pretty cool .
what about you ?
did your coilege have a pretty good footbaii team ?
where' d you go to coilege ?
no , we' re not gonna do this .
do what ?
maybe removing the tape for some water gave you the wrong idea .
we' re not two pals sitting here watching the bailgame .
i thought , i was just trying ...
i' m not an idiot .
i know that .
it' s not gonna work .
look , ijust want ...
it' s not going to work .
ijust want to talk .
just talk .
it could be as simple as me putting the tape back on your mouth .
aii right , please don' t .
i' ii shut up .
you said that you don' t want to torture me , you rememberthat ?
weil , if you reaily meant it , then ... you got to talk to me because ... just iet me babble at something , because ... if you just iet me sit here in silence ...
i ieft only to think about this ... then that would be cruelerthan anything you could ever do to me .
did you stop them ?
footbaii cheer , ohio state .
did you stop them ?
no .
they threw a forty yard touchdown pass .
they went to the rose bowl .
and we went to the " heinz ketchup bowi in missoula " .
so where' d you go to coilege ?
i did two years at liberty community coilege .
liberty they had a good reputation .
liberty' s got a great science department .
you heard about that ?
one of the best science departments in the country .
in the world , in fact .
that' s where nasa gets aii of their astronauts ... from they' re aii liberty coilege graduates .
i got good grades in high school .
i didn' t have to go to liberty .
it was in the neighborhood .
in the neighborhood of saint pete' s .
that makes sense .
does it ?
you get iost at those big schools ... you get a better education at the smailer ones .
michigan was just one iong party .
reaily ?
i was eighteen , on my own ... practicaily my first time out of jasper , illinois .
and you just get distracted .
that' s why it took me six years to graduate .
you have too good a time .
i wouldn' t have done that .
you' d be surprised .
if i' d gone away , i would have worked my ass off .
but i didn' t .
i don' t want to talk about it .
is there a schooi you wanted to go to ?
come on , teii me about coilege .
i got into arizona state and i didn' t go .
why arizona state ?
i iiked the footbaii team colors .
what' s the big secret in arizona ?
who am i gonna teil ?
it was a stupid idea .
weil , i work for a movie producer .
i heartwenty stupid ideas a day .
i' m gonna need a iittle help with this .
thanks .
so , you and arizona state ?
it' s iong ago , years ago .
come on , please .
i wanted to study archaeology .
archaeology ?
growing up i wanted to be iike donald johanson .
who' s that ?
in ' 74 he discovered the missing iink between humans and apes .
he was teaching at arizona state .
everything works out forthe best .
how' s that ?
my girlfriend didn' t want to ieave home .
i was iearning to be a cook in my uncle' s restaurant .
that was betterthan archaeology at arizona state ?
it was reality .
do i iook iike an archaeologist ?
do i talk iike one ?
i don' t know .
i' ve never met one .
i got a brain fuii of footbaii stats and recipes .
donald johanson mind that iowa state is cailed the hawkeyes ... and orthat oregano tastes great in gaspacho .
how do you know what stupid shit he knows ?
certain people aren' t supposed to do certain things .
i don' t believe that .
aii i know is where i grew up , it was the same for everybody ... yourfavorite team was the flyers .
yourfavorite group was kiss .
yourfavorite " charlie' s angel " was farrah .
you wore adidas sweatsuits and puma sneakers .
you smoked marlboros by twelve ... you wanted to iook iike travolta and act iike serpico .
i wanted to go on excavations to find iost cities ... that' s for geeks and weirdoes .
i was afraid to teii kate jackson was my favorite " charlie' s angel " .
i don' t think people would have cared .
weil , maybe not in jasper , but in my neighborhood ... you got to a certain age , when you see that missus zito' s backyard ... wasn' t fucking cairo .
missus zito ?
i used to stuff my knapsack with ... shovels and notebooks and i' d go whereverthere was some dirt .
and i go to parks and playgrounds and i go to backyards .
i' d just start digging .
i' d pretend it was egypt , asia , the middle of south america .
i fiiled up notebooks with diagrams ... of where i' d been and what i' d found .
it was aii junk .
it was just chicken bones , pieces of broken cups .
but i would treat those things iike precious artifacts .
i' d treat them iike they were bones from some prehistoric bird .
and you grow up ... you get older .
you understand iife better .
you see things and people for what they are .
and you realize those bones are chicken bones .
just ieftovers from someone' s iunch .
did you mean jacklyn smith .
yourfavorite " charlie' s angel " , jacklyn smith ?
no , kate jackson .
kate jackson ?
that' s reaily ?
what' s wrong with kate jackson ?
nothing .
ijust ...
i can see you not being into farrah and aii that perfection ... but kate jackson ...
sabrina overjacklyn smith ?
that i don' t get .
sabrina was very athletic .
i iiked that .
jacklyn was athletic .
rememberthe opening credits ?
she knew aii the karate .
you don' t think sabrina knew karate ?
she was the smartest one .
yeah , of the " charlie' s angels " , but that' s a heii of a sliding curve .
who would you choose ?
starsky from " starsky and hutch " .
i iiked the other guy .
hutch didn' t have half the sex appeal .
i' m not talking about sex appeal , i' m talking about cool .
hutch was cool .
not as cooi as crocker on " miami vice " , but he was cool .
crocker was cool .
not my type , but definitely cool .
you know what i never got ?
how did doc from " the love boat " get so many women ?
women go for doctors .
because a doctor on the love boat , how impressive is that ?
it didn' t make any sense .
about as much as fonzie scoring .
what do you mean ?
he wasn' t what you' d caii a stud .
what do you mean ?
weil , he' s kinda short and pudgy .
he was " the fonz " .
i mean , he was " the fonz " .
aii right .
he was " the fonz " .
i got a question foryou .
if you had to go on a stakeout with a female cop ...
who would it be ?
besides " charlie' s angels " ?
remember , the angels don' t count .
they quit the force to work for charlie .
i' d have to say angie dickinson .
policewoman " .
very good .
besides being hot , she was the toughest , kick ass thing going .
tom , what are you doing here ?
you know , even with aii this stuff that you' ve done ... it' s easy to see you' re not a kiiler .
you' re a good person .
why don' t we just end this before it goes any further ?
you know , you remind me of these guys who eat at the restaurant .
they came in and talk about how they want a thick , tender steak .
and once the waiter comes over and teils them the special ... this big debate starts .
boy , that iobster sounds good .
geez , do i reaily want such a heavy meal ?
me , ijust want a steak , i eat a fucking steak .
i don' t want to see the menu , i don' t need to hearthe specials .
if that test comes back positive , i' m gonna kiii you .
kiiling me is going to be more complicated than ordering a steak .
we' ii see .
how you gonna do it ?
strangle me ?
you gonna put a bag over my head ?
come on , teii me .
my morbid curiosity wants to know .
i' m gonna cut yourthroat and you' re gonna bleed to death .
you' re gonna stand there and watch the blood spiii aii overthe floor ?
you have that in you ?
you could do that to another human being ?
i couldn' t do it to another human being ... but i can do it to you .
i can kiii you .
i hate to ruin your plans , but that test is coming back negative .
you don' t know .
better hold onto that thought .
it' s aii you have .
fuck you .
you can talk aii you want about tv and coilege footbaii railies . you can tangle that smart tongue of yours around anything you want .
you' re just having a difficult time getting it .
nothing else matters to me .
if it comes back positive , i' m gonna kiii you .
the only thing that' ii be easier than that wiii be kiiling myself .
so who else knows you' re gay ?
i' m not gay .
you' re not gay ...
who else knows you' re " bi " ?
i' m not " bi " .
i iike women .
you' re straight ?
you iike women , okay , aii right ...
you' re a good iooking guy ... who' s probably screwed every teresa maria and gina you' ve ever met .
and how many women have you screwed ?
teii me .
not a iot .
whateveryou consider a iot , i' m iess than that .
less than a iot .
fuck you .
you' ve had ioads of women in the back seats of cars ...
you see , intercourse is such an intimate thing ...
i' m not the only one ...
i can' t just fuck anyone ...
i need a bond .
admit it !
i need to trust .
our night was a one time deal .
one night doesn' t make me anything .
you are absolutely right .
just iike if i spent one night with a woman ... it wouldn' t make me straight .
you could sleep with playmates and it wouldn' t make you straight .
i' ve had my share of girlfriends .
in high school .
even now , when i meet a woman that i' m sexuaily attracted to ... that i want to sleep with ... but does that mean that i' m gonna go get married and iive happily ...
neverto sleep with another man ?
what' s yourfucking point ?
putting people in fucking boxes , you' re straight oryou' re gay .
it' s nonsense .
human beings are too complex .
being with a man or wanting to be with a man doesn' t make you gay .
it' s totaily messed up .
if a giri goes to her boyfriend and says ... she wants to fuck around with another girl ... you think he' s gonna be " weirded out " by that ?
of course not .
he' s gonna wanna watch , maybe even join in .
but if a guy asks his girlfriend the same question ... she' d fuckin ' flip her iid .
that' s totaily messed up for guys who prefer women ... and have a slight curiosity about men .
they' re forced into repressing it .
they' re made to think iike there' s something' s wrong with them .
it isn' t the act that is wrong .
that' s what' s natural .
what' s wrong is how society makes you feei about it ... because nobody can admit ... that people aren' t completely gay or completely straight .
it' s nonsense .
where' d you get that , from " guide to how to make straight men gay " ?
you have nothing to be ashamed of .
you' re not here because i was with a man .
i know .
you think i' m responsible foryour ...
are you absolutely sure that you have it ?
tests could be wrong .
mistakes can be made aii the time .
i tested it twice the iast three weeks .
three weeks ?
that' s how iong you' ve known ?
twenty four days .
that' s nothing .
no wonderyou' re acting the way you are .
you' re in shock overfinding out .
i' m in shock ?
yes , you' re in shock .
and you' re reacting with an anger that anybody would have ... but most people wouldn' t take it this far .
you gotta think about this .
just take the time to think about this .
this won' t accomplish anything .
this is nobody' s fault .
and iater on and i stiii feei this way , you' ii have no trouble coming back ?
you don' t realize here you' re in deep trauma .
trauma ?
i thought i was in shock .
this gets worse by the minute .
look , i realize you' re upset .
but you' ve got to put some perspective on this .
perspective ...
people with hlv iead happy , healthy iives .
it' s not a death sentence anymore .
you don' t have alds , tom .
you are hlv positive .
there' s a difference .
do you know the difference ?
for someone who just had a negative hlvtest ... you seem overly concerned .
i' m not gonna iie to you , i' m gonna get the fuck out of here .
what are you gonna do to yourself when i walk out that door ?
thank you forthe concern , but at twenty four days ... this is how i feei and nothing' s gonna change that .
why did you pick me that night ?
why' d you iet that night ever happen ?
i have just one iife .
i chose one set of feelings over another .
and denied part of yourself .
i denied a part of myself so i could keep the most important .
and what was that ?
yourtough guy image , your neighborhood pals ?
my wife .
you said you weren' t married .
high schooi sweethearts .
does she know ?
know what ?
that i was with you ?
the only time i was ever unfaithfui was with a man ?
that i' m hlv positive ?
i don' t know .
she might have figured ... some of it out after a doctor told her she had a lupaninopathy .
there' s a word a iot of harvard guys don' t know .
you' re smart .
any idea ?
swoilen glands .
it started causing her pain under her arms .
she had night sweats and she iost a few pounds .
we thought she was just worn down .
she always worked too hard .
they ran a iot of tests .
it was just one test to coverthe bases .
was she hlv positive ?
twenty seven years old .
have you told her about this ?
i can' t .
you have to .
tom , you have to talk to her about it .
she was a mess when she ieft the doctor' s office .
son of a bitch just iet her go ...
iike he just got through teiling her she had a fucking cold .
how do you teii somebody that and just iet them ieave ?
wouldn' t even caii me .
she was confused .
she was upset .
how do you teii somebody that and just iet them ieave ?
she ran a iight .
she was alive when the ambulance got herto the hospital .
what must have been running through her mind when she missed that iight .
and what if it wasn' t an accident ?
what if she ran it ... because of the pain it caused her knowing i' d done something wrong ?
maybe a prostitute , maybe another woman ?
maybe the truth ?
not being sure what to think , not wanting to hearthe truth ... so she runs a iight and doesn' t have to hear it with her own ears .
doesn' t have to hear ... how the man she' s devoted her iife ... to isn' t the man she thought he was .
and that' s my biggest fear ... that when she went up to heaven , she found out .
and right now she' s up there watching .
and she' s so hurt .
she so hurt by what she knows about me .
i tried so hard to keep it from her .
she wouldn' t understand .
how do you explain that ?
that you can be kiiled by the person who you love most ?
you just , you can' t .
now you ask me again about perspective .
doing this isn' t going to change anything .
we owe her .
what if she had it first ?
it' s possible .
she was showing symptoms before you were .
she was showing symptoms before you .
swoilen glands .
it makes sense she had it before you .
it could have happened that way .
it could have happened that way .
shut yourfucking mouth .
you' re a reai fuck , do you know that ?
fuck you !
what do you say we get out of here ?
go back to your place ?
you want to go back to my place ?
no , we can' t do that .
you know , it' s true what they say about older women .
what is that ?
we do try harder .
no , i can' t .
i can' t do it .
i' m sorry .
it' s not personal .
i mean , you' re cute , but you' re nothing special .
sometimes you' re just ionely .
you need to not be alone .
you know ?
yes .
i know .
open your mouth .
open your mouth .
fuck you .
hey , do you know why most beer bottles are dark ?
sunlight .
the beer sits in the sun too iong , you get that " skunky " taste .
do you know the purpose of a skunk' s scent ?
a defense against other animals .
that' s right .
very good .
do you know how many sonnets shakespeare wrote ?
a hundred and fifty four .
i don' t understand shakespeare .
i have no idea what a sonnet is .
it' s a iyric poem , fourteen iines .
oh , i don' t give a shit .
there was a time i did .
i got aii those books on strange facts .
athousand and one things to know .
pretty stupid , huh ?
there' s something only a dumb person does and that' s to feei so dumb .
you know what that stuff is ?
that' s not no smarts .
it' s just dog tricks .
you roii over , you play dead , that' s not no smarts .
i' d go to the museums , i walk around , i study the paintings .
but i never got it .
i tried .
i made an honest attempt to make myself better ... to improve who i was .
and then this happens .
one night and it destroys iives .
send everything else away and ieave behind nothing but pain .
it' s aii i have now .
pain iike nothing i' ve ever known .
it doesn' t ieave , it never ieaves .
there' s so much ...
i have so much pain ...
so much ...
ijust want it to stop .
i' m so sorry .
i' m so sorry for everything .
it' s gonna be okay .
it' s not gonna be okay .
i' m sorry .
i' m sorry .
i wish i could hold you .
just teii you everything' s gonna be okay .
it' ii be okay .
everything .
son of a bitch !
no , tom ...
you son of a bitch .
no , i was holding you , that' s ail .
is this what you want ?
you fuckin ' sneak !
you can' t do this , tom !
there' s too many ways this could have happened .
we kiiled her !
what if you' re wrong ?
aii you have to do is pass the test .
just pass the test .
tests aren' t fool proof .
mistakes are made aii the time .
you are a perfect example of what' s wrong with this world .
no one wiii stand up and say " it' s me .
i' m guilty , i did it .
you iive by your own rules ... and now you have to pay forthat .
because i met you at a bar ... and i came back with you that i deserve this ?
you came home with me twice .
and that makes me some kind of a monster ?
by the way , if you remember , you invited me back here .
you set me up .
you' re always gonna play it iike you' re the innocent one .
you think because we came back here we were gonna fuck ?
is that who you are ?
you fuck every guy you meet ?
trust me , you don' t want to get into this .
you' ve got this idea about me .
and you' re wrong .
you want me to be the evii one ' cause that makes it easierforyou .
you reaily think you' re a victim ?
you' re convinced of it , aren' t you ?
you know i am .
dan , when was the iast time you had sex ?
i don' t see how that has anything to do with this .
what is it , a secret ?
some dangerto nationai security ?
weil , if ijust knew the relevance of the question ...
listen to yourself .
you sound iike a iawyer .
i only want to know when was the iast time you had sex ?
i had sex four months ago with a guy named bob .
bob .
bob taylor .
bob taylor .
you' re sure of that ?
very .
it' s always " very " with you .
very sure , very safe .
yeah , i iike the word .
you know what the worst thing about adultery is ?
once you do it , you' re always an adulterer .
life is harsh iike that .
you' re a fuckin ' saint , aren' t you ?
you fuck once , you can never be a virgin again .
you steai once , you' re always a thief .
and if you' ve iied once , then you' re always a iiar .
but i' m not a iiar , am i ?
when was the iast time you had sex ?
bob taylor .
last summer .
you fuck once , you can never be a virgin again .
bob taylor .
lie once and you' re a fucking iiar .

i' m fucking teiling you !
what about that guy you met at shampoo the other night ?
you know , the skinny blond kid .
what ?
what about him ?
how do you know about that ?
that wasn' t bob , was it ?
you were foilowing me ?
how iong have you been foilowing me ?
when you were aii over him ... are you teiling him how you were a " big scaredy cat " ?
you fucking foilowed me .
when you went to his place did you teii him how you were " safe " ?
very safe " ?
we kissed .
nothing else .
that' s it .
you were up there a pretty iong time .
we watched tv .
oh , yeah , what did you watch ?
i don' t know , i don' t remember .
but nothing happened .
that' s it , nothing happened .
i mean , we were up there only kissing , you' re sure ?
you weren' t in the room .
that' s not the story i caught blondie teiling at the bar a few nights iater .
ronald was pretty graphic .
weil , he' s iying .
he' s a iiar .
who ?
ronald .
is that his name ?
i made that up .
weil , he' s iying .
you know kids , you buy them a few drinks , they' ii teii you anything .
you' re iying .
it' s so hard to get the truth around here .
i did nothing wrong .
you see this iie ?
you could have said this iast tuesday ... but you wanted to appear pure .
but you' re not , are you ?
you' re not pure .
i watched you for a short time ... and i caught you in a iie .
i didn' t come iooking to do this , but after seeing the way you are ... it only made sense what i had to do .
i can imagine the otherfive years .
how many blondies have there been ?
i neverforced anyone to be with me .
what about aii the others you got sick ?
they don' t count ?
i' m not sick !
you played god with that kid .
why would you want to do that ?
you do whateveryou want ... and if people get hurt , too bad forthem .
oh , so now i' m responsible for everyone ?
why not ?
fuck you .
people make choices .
you made a choice .
i owe you nothing .
then why so many tests ?
if you felt no responsibility to protect other people ...
then why so many tests ?
for me .
for me .
if i was sick , i' d want to know so i could take care of myself .
but how is it possible for someone who' s always safe to get sick ?
a iot of safe people get tested .
and a iot of unsafe people don' t .
why is that ?
i didn' t trick anyone .
you cheated on your wife .
no one but you .
you said you needed a bond , you said you needed trust .
we fucked after only two hours after meeting each other .
that' s not a deception , that' s not a trick ?
you just gonna keep twisting it around ?
i foilowed you .
i saw you .
yeah , i' d iike to foilow you , you fuckin ' cretin ... see where you go , what you do .
see how much of this shit is " the true truth " ... and how much of it is yourtruth .
how many guys have there reaily been , tom ?
five , ten ?
how many drunken nights did you stop at the park and give someone head ?
and am i here because i' m the only one ... or because i' m the only one you could find ?
and now you want to know how many men i' ve fucked .
what about five years ago ?
you didn' t give a shit then , did you ?
aii you cared about was one dick up your ass ... before you slipped into your pretty iittle wife' s bed .
i' m ready to iet you go .
i wiil .
i' ii iet you go ... but i want you once , i want this one time , you teii me the truth .
i' ve told you the truth .
no , no .
not some builshit you think i want to hear .
admit to me that you' ve made mistakes .
you haven' t worn rubbers sometimes , maybe a iot .
you' ve gotten drunk and can' t remember .
teii me always means sometimes and i' ii iet you go .
it' s not true .
i' ii end it but i need the truth .
teii me you nevertook a test before and you walk .
i can' t do that .
teii me how sorry you are ... that you didn' t realize what you were doing .
teii me you were with aii those men ... because you were ionely .
i could understand that .
teii me that .
i' ii iet you go .
i wiil .
no , it' s not true .
you' re iying to me .
lying .
you' re iying to me .
that' s one more iie .
teii me you' ve kiiled people .
teii me you nevertook a test ' cause you don' t give a shit about anyone .
teii me you kiiled me .
teii me you kiiled my wife .
i should kiii you right now .
i should .
you don' t fuckin ' care .
you don' t care .
i don' t care ?
every day of my iife i think about this .
everyone i touch ... and you sit there and say that i don' t care ?
when every day ... every day someone says , " you' ve got to be safe and careful , dan .
don' t make a mistake , dan .
and you think you understand ?
you don' t understand anything .
ijust want to be with someone and don' t think about it .
for one second , i want to know what it feels iike not to care .
you sit in your iittle fuckin ' house with your iittle wife ... and your basebaii games and you think nothing' s gonna touch you .
weil , fuck you , it did .
what do you think' s gonna happen now ?
even if it comes back positive , there' ii be doubt if it was her .
and that' s the good news .
because when that comes back negative there wiii be no doubt .
she ran that red iight because she couldn' t iive with what she' d done .
she gave it to you , tom .
she gave it to you .
and your whole world is over .
you' re free to go .
dan , before you go i need to know something .
were you ever reaily tested before ?
what does it matter now ?
it doesn' t .
no , i wasn' t .
why ?
i guess i was afraid .
you guess ?
i was afraid .
you didn' t want to know .
no , i didn' t .
ijust knew ...
ijust knew i didn' t have it .
i reaily am sorry about your wife .
i hope you find some help .
it was positive .
the test was positive .
no , it' s not possible .
i' m sorry .
why are you doing this ?
why are you iying to me , tom ?
you wouldn' t have iet me go .
today is day twenty six and it seems different .
stacey would have every right to do to me what i did to you .
i promised things to her , i loved her .
and i was supposed to protect her ... and in the end i' m the responsible for what happened to her .
but with you , i put my iife in your hands ... someone i didn' t even know , and i got what i deserved .
and you' re probably getting what you deserve .
no , you don' t deserve this .
no one deserves this .
why are you doing this ?
why are you doing this ?
why are you fucking with me ?
i' m healthy .
look at me .
wiii you iook at me ?
look at me !
