he' s inside .
get him !
he' s gone !
search the room .
hey , a party .
am i invited ?
john smith , in the name of the king , you are under arrest for treason in jamestown .
treason ?
you must be looking for ratcliffe .
don' t let him get away !
after him !
thanks for droppin ' in .
anyone else care to join him ?
cut him off !
i' ve got him now !
oh , he' s jumped !
the king believed my story .
pity .
i so would have preferred to see you hanged .
i did everything i could to save him .
and that is the death of john smith .
i wanted him alive !
as did l .
but , your majesty , you don' t need him to confirm what i' ve already told you .
we must wait until john rolfe returns with the chief of these indians .
the chief will only tell you more heathen lies .
war is the only way .
very well , ratcliffe .
prepare your armada , then .
but we will await the return of john rolfe ... and the indian chief .
oh , much time has passed since the news of john smith' s death .
perhaps it' s time to put this behind you .
i know you are right .
it' s just hard to say goodbye .
the earth is cold the fields are bare
the branches fold against the wind that' s everywhere
the birds move on so they survive
when snow' s so deep the bears all sleep
to keep themselves alive [ growling ]
they do what they must for now
and trust in their plan
lf i trust in mine somehow i might find
who i am
but where do i go from here
so many voices
ringing in my ear
which is the voice
that i was meant to hear
how will i know
where do i go
from here [ panting , trilling ]
my world has changed and so have i
i' ve learned to choose and even learned to say goodbye
the path ahead so hard to see
it winds and bends but where it ends
depends on only me
in my heart i don' t feel part
of so much i' ve known
now it seems it' s time to start
a new life on my own
but where do i go from here
so many voices ringing in my ear
which is the voice
that i was meant to hear
how will i know
where do i go
from here [ trilling ]
ship ahoy !
ship' s coming !
ship' s coming !
open the gate !
cast a line !
put your backs into it !
together , men !
easy left !
stations !
attention !
filthy barbarian .
huh ?
whoa , boy !
steady !
whoa !
down , boy !
runaway horse !
filthy savage !
no , wait !
wait !
stand down !
it' s all right now .
i' ve taken care of it .
the settlers need to know they can trust us to do the right thing .
you should not have interfered .
i beg your pardon ?
all right .
you have it .
i was trying to help .
i did not ask for your help .
well , you didn' t say " thank you " either .
whatever happened to manners and etiquette ?
well , since you are new here i don' t expect you to have them yet .
women !
i fear the indians may wage war .
oh , my dear , pocahontas would never allow that .
pocahontas ?
hmm .
john rolfe , your horse , sir .
oh , there you are .
thank you .
it' s time i met this chief pocahontas .
great chief , i am john rolfe .
according to the customs
how do you do ?
let him pass .
according to the customs of greater britain , i would like to present ... this horse as a gift of peace to the mighty pocahontas .
daughter , you ? this beast is for you .
no , i' m sorry .
it' s my fault .
this horse , it' s meant for
pocahontas , your king said .
or did he speak falsely ?
no !
never .
it' s just that this is
no , th this is perfectly fine .
hmm .
good job , rolfe .
i believe we can prosper together in this great land under king james ' gracious rule .
to build trust , i would like you ... to sail back with me ... to meet my king .
i do not want the pale chief' s land .
he wants mine .
why doesn' t he cross the salt water to see me ?
i' m afraid that simply isn' t done ,
your grand " chiefliness .
your kind are barbarians .
they only want our land !
they mean to destroy our sacred  is that what they want ?
you don' t know .
father , someone must go .
you speak with the tongue of a pale one .
you belong with them .
perhaps you should go .
no !
this is a matter of diplomacy .
you can' t handle a job like this .
i will go .
daughter
father , please .
i can do this .
you have your mother' s spirit .
very well .
it is decided .
but
grand .
grandmother willow , i need to speak with you .
is that my pocahontas ?
my , what is it , child ?
you are concerned about crossing the salt water .
what if i can' t bring peace ?
what if i' m destined to fail ?
what if i make things worse ?
what what if ?
what if the sky turns to fire and your nose falls off ?
long ago i told you to listen with your heart .
it is time to listen to your heart .
but the spirits around me  can help , but only the spirit within can guide you .
listen to the spirit within .
listen to the spirit within .
grandmother willow , it doesn' t work .
grandmother willow ?
easy up , men !
here we go .
righto .
over here .
easy .
to the starboard .
hoist away !
i will honour my vow not to break the peace with the pale ones ... but we must know their strength .
cut a notch in this staff for every pale face you see .
watch over my daughter .
i can' t take you this time .
stay out of mischief and look after one another .
do not forget this land .
you will always be with me .
wait .
what' s this ?
this is uttamatomakkin .
well , is uttama uttamakk
is he coming with us ?
are you coming with us ?
i say , are you hello ?
can you hear me ?
can he can he hear me ?
oh yes , of course .
this was a good idea , wasn' t it ?
this will be fine !
fantastic .
all hands on deck !
anchor ahoy !
undo the sails !
aye , sir !
ah nah , father .
hey !
hey !
what is that ?
what' s goin '
get him !
that' s it !
uh !
doh !
oh , meeko !
what are you doing here ?
what' s all this then ?
look , missy , i don' t cotton to stowaways , and i' il not have you disruptin ' my crew .
you can take this voyage below ... or in the brig .
you' re  a guest of the king , and is to be treated as such .
am i clear , captain ?
wh why would you do that ?
because , like it or not , you are the envoy ... and i am honour bound to protect you .
and honour , pocahontas , is the backbone of our civilization .
thank you .
land ho !
full sails !
heave ho !
keep ' em taut .
here we go .
welcome to london .
shall we ?
suit yourself .
the sun comes up , the lamps go down
the day begins in london town
there' s tea to brew and buns to bake [ together ]
and some who just refuse to wake
while shops are stocked and flocks are fed
the midnight men drift home to bed
school bells chime and church bells ring
children whine peddlers sing
what a day in london come and see who' s here
everyone knows someone
they' ve come from far and near
they bring their geese their finest fleece
to please the keenest eye
and hope and pray someone will say
there' s something they might buy
pocahontas , wait !
with pigs to slop and fish to gut
it ain' t exactly heaven but
we thank the lord and kiss the ground
for bed and board in london town
the upper crust lie fast asleep
but some of us got floors to sweep [ together ]
one day' s like the day before
can' t complain [ hiccups ]
lf there' s no war
what a day in london everything' s for sale
cabbages and onions
look up !
who' s that that girl up in the tree
it' s not a tree it' s moving , see
good grief what can it be look there , i swear
she' s flying through the air
she must be wild
she' s just a child pocahontas
i wish i had her hair
wouldn' t you care to join me , here ?
on the ground ?
this instant ?
my heart is pounding like a drum i can' t believe my eyes
in london people seem to come in every shape and size
so many paths , i wonder how they find their way [ squeaking ]
so many signs , i wonder what they really say
london is everything i' ve heard and more
london is nothing like i' ve seen before
music and feathered hats and roofs that shine
with flags flying higher than a pine
she seems so sweet she means us well
size 20 feet how can you tell
we' il rue this day you wait and see
what is to be or not to be
how do they build their huts so tall
can this be all one tribe the things they sell
the things i smell i never could describe
these cakes taste just like berries picked this very day
the sound a river makes still takes my breath
away
london' s as busy as a hive of bees
grandmother willow would just love these trees
crowded and loud but so exciting too
with colours i never even knew
what a day in london nothing strange at all
' cept a girl with someone maybe ten feet tall
this day' s become a day no one is likely to forget
a day we' il all remember as the day two worlds have met
london is everything i' ve heard and more such beauty' s rare .
london is nothing the strength of ten , i' ve heard .
like i' ve seen before she' s won the men , my word !
a brave young thing , to venture here .
music and feathered hats
and roofs that shine it will be an adventure .
and flags flying higher perhaps some brew to quench your thirst ?
than a pine but not with you i saw her first !
what a day in london history was made
take away the mystery then you' re not afraid
we' ve seen a girl i' ve seen a world
i never dreamed i' d see [ crowd ]
we never dreamed we' d see
and what an extra special day unique in truly every way unique in truly every way [ with crowd ]
how wonderful this london day [ all ]
turned out to be [ crowd shouting ]
you !
well done , rolfe , bringing back a heathen as an example .
look at her .
she sticks out like a sore thumb .
pocahontas is here as an emissary of her people .
a personal guest of the king .
the king has appointed me ... to lead an armada against the savages .
don' t tell me you didn' t know ?
the king wants his gold .
there is no gold .
another barbarian lie .
as soon as the ships are armed , i set sail ... to destroy the heathens and reclaim jamestown for james .
we must stop him !
warn your king of his lies !
but he wasn' t lying .
the parchment bore the king' s seal .
what ?
then your king' s promise to meet me was the lie .
a king doesn' t lie !
they cannot both be true .
no .
it it' s just a misunderstanding .
it has to be .
i can straighten this out .
come on .
are you riding or running ?
mrs. jenkins !
oh !
oh !
oh !
gads me gracious , is that my johnny ?
eww !
eww , johnny , you need a bath .
oh , oh , johnny !
look at you .
oh , you .
mrs. jenkins , i would like to introduce pocahontas .
pocahontas , mrs. jenkins .
the jenkinses have been with the rolfes for generations .
careful .
she' s about to put on some tea .
i' il put on some tea .
oh !
ooh .
oh , and uttamatomakkin .
ooh , i' il put on lots and lots of tea .
i' m off to see the king .
i want to go with you .
uh , pocahontas , the conventions in england are very complex .
i must go alone .
but but
now , i promise i will arrange for you to see the king .
my word as a gentleman .
trust me .
uh oh .
mm .
mm !
i must find a way to warn my people , to stop this .
leave it to johnny .
he gave you his word as a gentleman , my dear .
you can stake your life on that .
i didn' t exactly bring the indian chief
no , no , no , no .
i told you , i would meet with the chief and no one less .
knight to bishop three .
sire , i gave these people your word you would meet .
are we not honour bound  [ ratcliffe ]
the king is bound to nothing , when you cannot fulfill your mission .
you were sent for the savage leader and yet you bring back a woman .
a woman !
your highness , she is royalty a princess .
she is the daughter of a great chief who has travelled ... far from her homeland in the interests of peace .
meet with her , your majesty .
may i suggest she attend the hunt ball ?
let her go back to virginia having witnessed ... the royal might and majesty of english society .
sire , she doesn' t know our customs .
to subject her to this kind of scrutiny would be  i don' t understand , rolfe .
if she' s not a savage , then why shouldn' t she fit in ?
excellent idea , ratcliffe .
rolfe , you will bring her to the hunt ball .
prove to me she is as civilized as you claim , and ...
i will stop my armada ; if not , the armada sails .
but sire  it is decided !
pawn to king !
check .
of all the
how did it go ?
a disaster !
she' s invited to the hunt ball !
flabberdy jacks .
you were successful ?
when do i see the king ?
our meeting with the king has been corrupted .
you' re now invited to the hunt ball .
i don' t understand .
oh , it' s a trap !
ratcliffe manipulated the king !
he' s saying that if you' re civilized you can fit right in .
but it' s the elite of british society etiquette and manners .
there' s a million ways you can insult someone .
believe me , i know .
and if you slip up , just once , ratcliffe can convince the king that
then i must not " slip up .
i can' t learn your ways alone , but you can help me .
what must i do ?
john rolfe !
how do i look ?
hm ?
oh , lovely ... in your ... underwear .
didn' t mrs. jenkins exp uh , mrs. jenkins !
oh , my dear !
oh , come along , now .
let' s go finish your dressing .
have no fear we' re all right
you' ve got me , dear to see you' re a lady tonight [ gasps ]
what seems strange is just new [ trilling ]
people change every day till they find their own way
so can you
and wait till he sees you after you' re dressed
i think the king will be very impressed
wait till he sees you walking with ease
he' il be so pleased you came down from the trees
you' il be fine i can tell
it' s a very good sign that you' re doing so well [ gasps , giggles ]
one more tuck , one more bow [ sniffs , squawks ]
don' t get stuck on that clasp johnny' s lucky they asked
you to go [ sneezes ]
' cause wait till he sees you he' il be so proud
maybe he' il smile if he thinks he' s allowed
wait till he sees you there in your curls
john' s always had such a fondness for girls
with curls
and wait
wait till you' re out on the floor
show them what dancing is for
music is all you need see where a dance can lead
you two might come to see you were meant to be
so much more
wait till he sees you wait till tonight
fate has a way of arranging what' s right
after he sees you in your new clothes
a lady of grace from your head to your toes
pretty and pink as the roses he grows
who knows who knows
i can' t wait !
oh , i' ve got something for you .
flit , stop it !
it doesn' t belong here any more .
it' s beautiful !
i have personally taken charge of the entertainment for the hunt ball .
i want to make sure nothing ... goes ... right .
well , how do i look ?
pretty good , eh ?
say , i thought you were getting dressed .
you' re right .
you look great .
just don' t talk so much tonight and we' il be fine .
it' s called powder .
you look beautiful .
i' il put on some tea !
ohh .
the duke of edinburgh .
lady grey .
sir thomas ellery .
lord raymond and lady theresa .
the earl of essex .
the duke of buckingham and lady buckingham .
john rolfe and princess pocahontas ...
and utam uttata
ultimatum old tomato  try " uti .
oh , thank you , sir .
and uti .
jacket required , sir .
oh , dear .
goodness !
oh , my .
hello , your excellent ness .
your great , good good highness .
greetings , your magnificence cy .
uh
hmm .
welcome to england , pocahontas .
thank you , your grace .
what do you think of my kingdom , hmm ?
i think you must be a great king to have so many subjects , your majesty , and the loyalty of so many good men .
did you hear that ?
she thinks i am a great king !
oh , what a delightful child !
charming !
absolutely charming !
your excellency , please stop this armada .
oh , yes , yes , yes , yes .
but right now i can' t be rude and ignore my guests , can l ?
no !
so we shall discuss it later .
for now , my dear , enjoy the ball .
go on !
enjoy !
thank goodness .
rolfie !
rolfie , old boy !
listen , we' re having some friends out to the estate .
do come .
oh , yes , bring your delightful ... [ jabbering ] guest .
oh , miss [ stammers ]
hontas .
how drippingly marvellous to see you !
enchanting !
charming !
fabulous jewellery !
may the dance begin !
may l ?
in one night you will have done more for the cause of peace than a hundred diplomats .
my , you look lovely .
i can' t even see the real you under there .
i do hope no one else does .
i was going to say the same about you .
it' s a very good thing smith is dead .
seeing how disloyal your heart is would certainly kill him .
dinner is served !
oh , no , madam .
the guest of honour is always on the king' s right hand .
your grace , perhaps now we might discuss  [ fanfare ]
your royal highnesses , lords and ladies of the court ... and our distinguished guest from the forests of the new world .
things are not what they appear
as tonight will make quite clear
but what is real will be revealed i can feel the moment' s near
things are never what they seem
that will be this evening' s theme
amusing sights for your delight
perhaps a few to make you scream
you' il be surprised to see whose disguise
is the cleverest one of the lot
after our show the whole world will know
who' s pretending to be what they' re not
lf a jester' s grin or a dancer' s spin should be pleasing
please say yea [ all ]
yea !
lf a juggler' s feat should be incomplete
he' s the one to greet with nay nay !
lf the fools we see look like you and me
then before the night goes by
ask why , why , why , why [ giggling maniacally ]
why why ?
things are not what they appear
and the finest proof' s right here
how i regret when first we met i believed my own worst fear
things are never what they seem
so in keeping with our theme
a change of hair a dress to wear
and our nightmare' s now a dream
shoeless and wild i saw this sweet child
as a danger to one and to all
savage , i thought what could rolfe have brought
now i see she' s the belle of the ball
things are never what they seem he' s right !
he' s right !
many don' t say what they mean he' s right !
he' s right !
a powdered face is just the place to conceal an ugly scheme
only one thing' s really clear
things are not what they appear [ crowd gasps ]
sire , please stop this !
she doesn' t understand !
oh , nonsense !
everybody loves a good bear baiting .
no !
stop this !
this is torture !
this is an animal nothing more .
a helpless animal .
sit down at once ... and we will overlook this savage behaviour .
your behaviour is savage .
you and your people are the barbarians !
what ?
sire , don' t let the savage get away with this .
seize her !
savages !
keep her away !
get her !
take them to the tower !
no !
your majesty , please !
it was a misunderstanding !
push me no farther ... or face treason .
where exactly do your loyalties lie ?
let go !
let go of me !
john rolfe !
john rolfe !
oi , you' re cheatin ' !
no , i' m not .
i' il play that card there .
the least you could do is put a head on it .
how much do i have to pay to get good beer here ?
you say it' s not true ?
but i just heard me self from a guard what was there .
the king' s gonna have her head .
that savage .
aye , i bet you old john rolfe wishes he never laid eyes ... on the likes of pocahontas .
aye !
oh !
what' s got into him ?
ah , i think i' il put on some tea .
what am i to do ?
who are you ?
what do you want ?
halt !
who goes there ?
john rolfe .
i have a prisoner .
open the gate .
hmm .
he' s escaping !
catch him !
now find her , flit .
flit !
john !
i knew you' d come !
there' s no time .
we must go .
john smith ?
i i thought you were dead .
greatly exaggerated .
let' s go !
there !
enjoy the accommodations .
i' il take care of it .
pardon me .
oh , very stylish .
riding or running ?
after them !
they' re getting away !
close the gate !
blast it !
they got away !
what happened to you ?
ratcliffe convinced the king i was the traitor .
i had to stay hidden let them continue to believe that i was dead .
i missed you so much .
i' ve thought of you every day .
all this time .
why didn' t you ever write to me ?
i wanted to .
i must have started a thousand letters .
pocahontas , all that matters is that we' re together again .
what about my people ?
once the armada sails , they won' t stand a chance .
how will her getting killed save them ?
well , are you suggesting she turn her back on them ?
are you suggesting she die for them ?
she can' t just sit back and watch .
she has no choice !
of course she has a choice !
pocahontas !
let her go .
you may not care about her safety
don' t you dare tell me i don' t care about her !
you love her .
do not forget this land .
in some new place on some new face
i' ve never seen
i might find where i belong someday
and there may even be another dream for me
waiting there somewhere along the way
listen to the spirit within .
who knows where i go from here
so many voices
only one thing' s clear
there' s nothing to lose
nothing to fear
the past is gone
i must move on
from here
i' m going back .
they' il hang you .
then i will be but the first to fall .
they' re not going to listen to you .
look at you .
how can they respect my culture if they haven' t seen it ?
this is insane !
nuts !
tell her she' s crazy .
you' re crazy .
i thought you may need whatever power ... this holds for you .
i think it' s time you taught society a lesson .
i have decided .
hear ye !
hear ye !
the high court of king james will herewith commence .
presenting the first order of business  [ door opens ]
pocahontas !
guards !
guards !
surely his majesty would not refuse an audience ... with a visiting princess .
james .
your grace , if you insist on war ... my people will fight to the last warrior .
there is nothing to be gained but much to be lost , for all of us .
there is no gold , is there ?
no .
ratcliffe assured me  [ smith ]
that i was dead ?
was it true ?
ratcliffe has lied to you about everything .
there are many voices around you ... but you must listen to your own voice .
why do you speak out when so many doubt you , even when it could mean your life ?
because i speak the truth .
silence !
ratcliffe has left !
we must stop him !
but it' s too late .
we must try .
you are the best soldiers in the civilized world .
we sail to scour the world of the savage vermin .
are you with me ?
riders approaching !
smith !
raise anchor !
cast off !
lift anchor !
i thought he was dead !
i' m the ghost of john smith .
run for your lives !
who started the party without me ?
you call this a party ?
you' re not having any fun ?
ha ha !
drop the anchor !
all aboard !
clear the mast !
clear the mast !
prepare to crash !
now i can finally get rid of you , you savage !
mind if i cut in ?
trying to make a point ?
please , don' t hurt me , smith .
i was just doing my duty .
sheath your sword .
surely you know that a good soldier always follows orders .
if it were i , i would have killed you years ago .
as i was saying , i never liked you , smith .
i hereby sentence you to death .
goodbye , smith .
very stylish .
i learned it from the best .
pity .
i so would have preferred to see you hang .
huh ?
your majesty , the fugitives are getting away !
they' ve sabotaged the armada .
stop them !
no more lies .
arrest him .
john smith , what a heroic return .
why , thank you , my lady .
how did you escape ?
john , we thought you were dead .
lord advisor to the royal court .
what a wonderful honour .
it' s what you' ve always wanted .
and you , you' ve done everything you' ve set out to do ...
and more .
your people will be very proud .
yes .
it it will be good to see them again .
well , perhaps one day you' il return to london .
pocahontas  john , l
the king has given me a ship !
this is my dream !
ours .
every day a new adventure .
new lands to discover .
i' il chart a new course .
uh , and you' il be at my side , naturally .
a ship of our own !
i' il put a crew together immediately !
we' il set sail right away !
what ?
that' s ... not what you want , is it ?
we walked the same path once .
i have found where i belong .
i hope you will also find happiness .
may the great spirit always be with you .
pocahontas !
pocahontas !
mrs. jenkins !
oh , there you are , dear .
over here .
ooh .
aww .
mrs. jenkins , thank you so much for everything .
is john rolfe here ?
i haven' t seen him , dear .
i thought he was with you .
maybe he hates goodbyes as much as i do .
goodbye , dear .
well , perhaps one day we' il return to london .
john !
what about your duty to the king ?
i have a duty to honour what is in my heart , pocahontas .
ta ta , pip pip .
come on , uti .
let' s put on some tea .
and you , mind your manners .
let' s go home .
two hopeful hearts
two lands apart
