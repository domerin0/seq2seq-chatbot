be very quiet .
i' m hunting rabbits .
i am a duck bent on self preservationum .
say your prayers , rabbit .
it' s rabbit season .
duck season .
rabbit season !
duck season !
fire !
hold everything .
daffy gets blasted .
daffy gets blasted .
daffy gets blasted again !
what' s the matter with you people ?
we can' t do this kind of stuff anymore .
brothers warner ... show biz legends like me shouldn' t have to play stooge ... to that long eared , carrot chomping , overbite challenged ...
what' s up , doc ?
bobby , how' s the wife ?
great nose job , chuck .
thanks , girls .
good rug , mel .
never would have guessed .
pardon me .
the pleasure is mine .
fellas , i think daff' s right .
maybe i' il take a vacation .
go visit my 542 nieces and nephews .
mr. duck , excuse me , i' m sorry .
i don' t see how we can have a bugs bunny movie without bugs bunny .
oh , my heavens , no .
you couldn' t have a movie without bugs bunny .
if you don' t mind me asking , whose glorified personal assistant are you ?
kate houghton , vice president , comedy .
right .
kate did lethal weapon babies .
finally , a lethal weapon that i can take my grandchildren to .
gentlemen , check your phones .
our latest research shows that bugs bunny is a core asset ... that appeals to male and female , young and old throughout the universe ... while your fan base is limited to angry fat guys in basements .
yeah , but ...
come on , fellas , i' m thrice the entertainer the rabbit is !
fine , it' s hilarious ... but moviegoers these days demand action heroes , like me !
top that , rabbit .
so , it has come to this , has it ?
i' m afraid the brothers warner must choose ... between a handsome matinee idol ... or this miscreant perpetrator of low burlesque .
whichever one' s not the duck .
that' s the stuff from my office .
you don' t have an office .
not anymore .
symbolically , this is bad .
please , brother .
other brother ?
icy she wolf ?
help me , please .
i' m too moist and tender to retire .
let me escort you out .
wait !
i haven' t tried toadying , kowtowing , or butt kissing yet .
i' m still begging here !
freeze !
can i try that again ?
no , thank you .
we' il call you .
hey , d. j. how did your tryout go ?
well , let' s see .
i can say i made an impression .
your father can get you a job anytime he wants to .
i know , but i don' t want that .
i' d really rather earn it , sir .
mr. warner mentioned you this morning .
he did ?
what did he say ?
he said don' t forget the turtlewax .
what about animation ?
i could do cartoons .
dead duck walking .
morning , mr. bunny .
very hot now .
and i do voices .
listen .
excuse me .
" fetch the stick , boy .
what a maroon .
you can' t handle the truth .
some grip , lady .
i need you to eject this duck .
lady , this is daffy duck .
exactly .
not anymore .
we own the name .
yeah ?
you can' t stop me from calling myself ...
what do you know ?
you fired daffy duck ?
no , i didn' t .
i did .
they did .
you just were following orders .
you know what ?
you don' t know me .
you' re kate houghton , you' re the vp of comedy .
go figure .
you drive a red 1988 alfa romeo .
good engine .
little under driven .
i know this because you nearly ran me over last week .
anyway , about that duck , you want me to get rid of him still ?
duck , yes .
eject the duck , please .
i can' t do that .
why not ?
he' s gone .
what are you waiting for , backup ?
shabby job so far , constable .
quick !
after me !
now you' re gonna pay for that one .
come here !
dress inspector !
look out !
one side , spartacuses .
come on .
daffy , stop !
cut him off at the pass , boys .
all units in pursuit of little black duck .
well , that' s just cheating .
don' t follow me .
that' s not right .
cut !
that' s lunch , everybody !
that airbag cost a lot of money .
i' m okay .
good morning .
batman , you good ?
all right .
my chariot awaits .
yes !
bat lights .
bat conditioning .
bat stereo .
to the duck cave .
now what are you doing ?
stay away from that batmobile !
i' m allowed to steal .
i' m a celebrity .
tell it to the judge !
feeling pretty good about yourself ?
i am .
you bested that dastardly duck ?
i did .
you' re gonna offer your catch to the pretty executive ?
indeed .
miss houghton !
get out of the way !
look out !
what do you know ?
i found nemo .
i think she likes you .
your father would be so ashamed of you .
but i was ...
it was ...
at first , they told me to lose the stutter .
now they tell me i' m not funny .
it' s a pain in the butt being politically correct .
you' re telling me .
what kind of performance do you call that ?
you made me sound like a total space cadet , man .
i' m sorry you feel that way .
i was trying to be real to your character .
if you , like , goof on me in the sequel , i' m coming after you .
and i' il give you a scooby snack !
there are some areas of the script i think we need to address .
there' s no heart , no cooperation , nobody learns anything .
daffy learns not to stick his head in a jet engine .
he' s gone .
no , daffy always comes back .
i just tell him how much i need him .
we hug , we cry , i drop something heavy on him , i laugh .
the duck is history , okay ?
so the question is ... how can i help you reposition your brand identity ?
we team you up with a hot female co star .
usually ...
i play the female love interest .
about the cross dressing thing ?
in the past , funny .
today , disturbing .
lady , if you don' t find a rabbit with lipstick amusing ... you and i have nothing to say to each other .
look , i' m trying to be nice ... but i was brought in to leverage your synergy ... and i am not going to let you or some wacky duck ...
daffy .
wacky , daffy , nutty , fruitcake , crispy over rice , it doesn' t matter .
well , these matter .
and this .
and they say we get daffy back .
right , boys ?
we want daffy !
bring him back !
we love daffy !
little damian .
hey , granny .
hi , tweety .
how was work today ?
eventful .
what a nice young man .
guess who ?
so did you miss me ?
i' m glad i was fired .
in a few days , they' il be kissing my befeathered rump ... begging me to come back .
but i won' t .
did i miss the part where i invited you in ?
i' il be too busy accepting numerous , multiple offers .
every studio in town ...
who am i kidding ?
my career is over .
perhaps i was being too polite .
get out !
i' il starve .
i' il have to eat envelope glue .
wait , a sushi bar .
no !
daffy .
yes .
leave my father' s house .
now .
you live with daddy ?
yeah , so ?
just , you know , kind of temporarily .
i' ve hit rock bottom .
i' m hanging out with a security guard who lives with his father .
my grease and gravy !
your dad is damian drake .
the super spy .
he' s an actor who plays a spy .
and that ?
that was his i spy award .
ingenious .
an actor playing a super spy as a cover for being a super spy playing an actor .
in fact , i' il bet this whole dump is a super spy lair .
nothing is as it seems .
you' re probably protected by an invisible force field right this minute .
the force field penetrating apple .
just feel free to continue your delusional ranting ... while i answer my ...
remote ?
hello ?
son ?
dad ?
what are you doing in the painting ?
i wanted to keep you out of this , but there' s no one else i can trust .
can you hold on a second ?
are you shooting a movie or something ?
a new damian drake movie ?
cool .
come to las vegas .
ask dusty tails for the blue monkey .
the blue monkey ?
what' s a blue monkey ?
a diamond .
a very special diamond .
find dusty tails .
dad , you need me to call the police or something ?
no police .
dad , are you all right ?
i' m sorry i never told you this before , but i ...
dad ?
diamond ?
i' m rich !
i' ve joined the leisure class .
i gotta go save my dad .
your dad , yeah .
so count me in .
a spy caper .
double agents , exploding bikinis , tigers hanging from helicopters !
i' m through with show biz !
from now on , i' m gonna live the adventure .
next stop , las vegas .
i' il take my dad' s old car .
a super spy car .
let' s ride .
this isn' t a spy car .
your dad is a spy .
ipso ergo , a spy car .
i used to deliver pizzas in this car .
secret pizzas ?
a spy pie , maybe ?
fine , be that way .
but it' s definitely a spy car !
a little help here ?
ducks .
you know how i know it' s a spy car ?
because it looks absolutely nothing like a spy car .
i don' t think this routine is gonna work without daffy , but ...
action .
say your prayers , rabbit .
it' s rabbit season .
duck season .
rabbit season .
rabbit season .
wait a minute .
see , i told you this wasn' t gonna work without ...
pain .
agony !
you' re fired .
what ?
but you ...
you got rid of our best duck .
you can' t fire me .
my films have made $950 million !
that' s not a billion .
nope .
not a billion .
okay .
all right .
i think we can all agree that the decision to get rid of daffy was a poor one .
but it' s time to move on .
and by move on , i mean reversing course and getting daffy back .
by monday .
i will have daffy back on monday .
that went well .
listen , doll face , if i know daffy , he' s already hit the road by now .
it' s good to stretch .
i' m getting tired of throwing you out of the car .
that' s my plan in a nutshell .
now , listen , if we run into anything that requires super spy skills ...
like cracking wise , smooching dames , you better leave that to me .
however , if we have any security guarding needs ...
very funny , duck .
i' m not a security guard .
for your information , it' s just a job .
it' s what i do for money .
what i really do is ...
i' m a stuntman .
you ?
a stuntman ?
please .
i am !
did you see those mummy movies ?
i' m in them more than brendan fraser is .
no , he couldn' t stand that .
one day he decides that , " no !
the bren master does all his own stunts !
listen , muscles , if this heap ever makes it to vegas , i' il do all the stunts .
duck here .
daffy , old chum , how the heck ...
cram it down your rabbit hole .
i think i can get you your old job back with less of a pay cut than usual .
so not interested .
i' m off to las vegas with my new sidekick d. j ... to match wits with spies and showgirls .
daffy duck' s quest for the blue monkey .
and you' re not in it .
blue monkey ?
blue monkey ?
daffy duck' s quest for the blue monkey .
this is unacceptable !
we cannot have 9 year olds working in sweatshops making acme sneakers ... not when 3 year olds work for so much less .
but , sir , they require naps .
put double espresso in their sippy cups .
what' s next on the agenda ?
where' s my people ?
what' s coming up ?
what' s the next thing ?
thank you , bob .
grave news , my friends .
direct your attention to the video screen .
cable , input , vcr , satellite .
input , satellite , tape , menu , rewind ... power , on .
it seems that damian drake' s son knows about the blue monkey ... and he is on his way to las vegas .
he must not find the location of the diamond before we do .
how is the interrogation going ?
he' s about ready to crack , boss !
cable , input , vcr and satellite , off .
we cannot let the good guys win this time , people .
we must capture this son of a spy ... and we must locate the diamond ... and use its powers for our own diabolical ends !
copy that to all departments .
i didn' t quite get that .
didn' t quite ...
something about capturing the son of a spy ... and using the diamond' s power for our diabolical ends .
be sure and use the laugh .
i like the laugh .
don' t you ?
and what is your name ?
mary .
well , mary ... how' d you like to do a little kissing later ?
that' s what they all say at first .
soon the acme corporation will tower over all of creation !
all of creation !
wait a minute .
yes ?
what about the duck ?
extra crispy .
hello ?
d. j. , i' m not here to fire you again .
i just want to know if that duck told you where he was going .
doesn' t anyone knock anymore ?
why are you torturing me ?
what have i ever done that ...
great .
i just fired the son of our biggest star .
this has been a career making day , kate .
first you get rid of the duck that everybody hates ... but then , of course , they all want him back .
and worst of all , you get into a big fight with bugs bunny ... who you revere and who you' ve tried to model your life after .
i hate to see a grown man cry .
especially when it' s a girl .
listen , toots , would it stop the waterworks ... if i told you daffy was going to las vegas with that guy d. j. ?
it might .
well , then , how' s about we travel in style in this ?
las vegas , jeeves .
taking you to las vegas .
you' ve got no music in your soul , sister .
i am aware of that , yes .
he sure went for all the extras .
what a maroon .
don' t touch anything .
this is damian drake' s car ...
let' s see .
no !
what does this one do ?
shaken , not stirred , sir .
it' s 5 : 00 somewhere .
lf you touch one more thing ...
i' m about to defy you .
now you done it .
arms at your side , please .
formalwear activated .
you clean up nice , kid .
no !
las vegas !
smell that , d. j. ?
that' s the sweet aroma of money , glamour ... and busload upon busload of senior citizens .
cool it , duck .
this could be dangerous .
right , we find dusty tails , save your dad , get the diamond ... apply kung fu liberally as needed .
under no circumstances are you to allow ... the young mr. drake and his duck cohort out of the casino in one piece .
is that clear ?
okay .
you want the varmints and what they come for .
i got you .
but what' s in it for old sam ?
i got you .
did you know that dusty tails sang the theme song to six damian drake movies ?
i know .
he' s my father .
your dad is damian drake ?
yes !
i' m kidding , relax .
we did that .
i say , listen up , y' all .
please put your greasy , buffet shoveling hands together ... for our next act .
if you' ve heard her before , you' re not here now .
so , i say , let me introduce you ... to miss dusty tails .
dusty !
can i talk to you ?
what the ...
what ?
dusty , i gotta talk to you .
i' m damian drake' s son , d. j. what ?
how do i know it' s you ?
you are damian' s son .
is there someplace we can talk ?
excuse me , i have to change .
okay , toots , hand over the diamond .
he brought a goose ?
it' s duck , thank you .
hi .
you again .
listen up , you darn imbeciles !
we gotta get them varmints and what they come for !
and then we blast them ?
then we blast them .
now if i were a giant diamond , where would i be ?
well , not there .
my dad' s in trouble ...
not here . ... and he said that i should ask you about the blue monkey .
so then you know ?
definitely .
yes .
i figured something must have happened when he didn' t show up .
i' m sorry , but that' s what comes with being a spy .
so , you' re a spy , too ?
the pop diva thing ?
that' s just one side of me .
i also work for the agency .
professional assassin .
it' s really hard trying to juggle the two sometimes .
i don' t know what i' il do when i have kids .
do you know how hard it is to find a nanny with advance weapons training ?
how many galoshes died to make that little number ?
what about this blue monkey ?
your father was assigned to track it down before the chairman could .
the diamond has supernatural powers .
it would be a disaster if it fell into the wrong hands .
i was supposed to give him this .
this is not a king sized diamond .
this is a queen of diamonds .
what kind of sick joke is this ?
can i have that ?
very funny .
that is so sweet .
you trying to take over for your father .
these evil forces ?
they' re bad people .
relax , sister .
i don' t know the meaning of the word " fear .
say your prayers , duck !
fear : noun .
a state of terror .
incoming !
this mission needs years of experience and training .
maybe .
i ain' t got time for that right now .
i gotta go save my dad .
don' t lose that card .
it' s important .
after him , boys !
easy on the feathers .
come back here , you card carrying coyote !
dadburn slapstick cliche !
faster !
climb like my life depended on it .
you run , i' il steer .
right !
i mean , left .
your other left .
that' s what i' m talking about !
is that all you got ?
that' s gonna leave a mark .
that' s not boxing .
bite his ear !
left and a right and a left and a right left !
i' m gonna come up on you .
i' il take that playing card .
after it , stunt boy .
man .
jump !
all right , when i say , place your bets , gentlemen .
money plays , loser stays .
everyone' s a ...
not everyone .
here' s my money .
now play .
card , sir ?
hit me .
don' t you want to look at your cards first , son ?
boy' s about as sharp as a bowling ball .
hit me .
no , hit me first !
i said await your turn , sir .
hit me .
no , hit me , fragnabbit !
he' s the boss .
you son of a ...
card , sir ?
hit me .
twenty one , a winner !
let' s go !
and then they made their heroic escape !
i say we do cirque du soleil and call it a night .
how about the liberace museum ?
all right , let' s see what this baby can really do .
now , that' s an interesting feature .
come back , you absconders !
watch yourself , ma' am .
i love this rug .
come back here , you varmints !
run .
move .
go .
nice car .
don' t hit me .
it' s a modified chevrolet with a big 24 on the side .
out of the way , fancy boy .
i' m a commandeering this here clown car .
after them , boys !
shotgun !
rag flagging ragtag sidekicks !
slow down , will you ?
i' m waddling here .
come back , you darn idiot galoots !
there' s gotta be 314 hotels and 142 casinos in las vegas .
we are never going to find that duck .
daff never misses a cue .
what' s up , duck ?
don' t you start with me .
excuse me .
you !
you .
him .
her .
them !
out of my way !
dagnabbit !
you are in big trouble , mister .
agreed !
out !
what are you doing , kidnapping me ?
stop the car .
this is my adventure , bub .
coming through .
what brings you to las vegas ?
you ran out of people to fire in l. a. ?
you stole my duck .
your duck ?
i belong to the world .
you know what ?
you can have him .
dynamite ?
who has dynamite ?
welcome to my world .
hang on .
throw it out the window .
throw it out !
but innocent people could be hurt .
throw it out the window !
it will send the wrong message to children .
didn' t he used to be behind us ?
we' re having duck tonight , boys .
just a suggestion , but all those in favor of not hitting that wall say " aye .
aye !
mother .
taking you to mother .
look , a shooting star .
quick , everybody make a wish .
you know , i' m beginning to think that this one is the spy car .
what ?
eta to mother , 10 minutes .
please return your seatbacks to their full and upright position .
so , what are your plans now , if i may ask ?
daffy will save us .
he' s the hero .
all right , bucktooth .
stick a carrot in it .
everybody calm down , all right ?
i can handle this .
sell my warner brothers stock .
i got an inside tip that bugs bunny is about to die .
out of gas .
what ?
it doesn' t work like that .
thanks , toots .
carrot ?
no , thanks .
you really think that playing card is going to help you rescue your father ?
yeah , i do .
you know this all sounds insane , right ?
i remember the first time i saw your dad in the movies .
so breathtaking .
your hair smells nice .
you say something ?
no , just saying good night .
i' m telling you , daffy ...
i heard the warner brothers say you were their best duck .
flattered though i may be , flattened i will not ... in order for you to get the laughs .
it' s all ...
and then ...
and your tail is on fire .
exactly my point .
no , really , your tail' s on fire .
daff , you' re accident prone .
what am i talking to you for ?
all you have to do is munch on a carrot , and people love you .
i need you to move my 12 : 00 appointment up to 2 : 00 and then back to 11 : 00 .
then just cancel it .
and i need you to get a helicopter and ...
no , don' t put me on hold .
oh , god .
i can' t die out here .
this wasn' t the plan .
after this comedy ...
i promised myself i would only do real movies ... about the human condition crammed with social relevance .
there' s nothing but a big rock for 10 miles in that , that ... that , and that direction .
i say we go that way .
say , who are you kidding here ?
we' re goners !
water !
i can' t die now .
think of the millions of children who want me to have the diamond .
the poor children !
look at that .
is it a mirage ?
or just product placement ?
who cares ?
with shopping convenience at such low prices .
water , fresca , mountain dew .
your product name here .
is this your idea ?
the audience expects it .
they don' t even notice this kind of thing anymore .
nice of wal mart to provide these wal mart beverages ... in return for us saying " wal mart " so many times .
where' s yosemite sam ?
what is your report ?
boss , it wasn' t me .
that razzan frazzan duck and that crazy son d. j ... and a humina humina dusty tails .
you know , that makes a lot of sense .
thank you .
mr. drake , are you going to save us the bother of eliminating your son ?
my son is going to kick your evil butt .
mr. chairman .
yes , dad .
desert operative .
no .
not a bad idea , dad .
our desert operative is due for a win .
i told you we should have made that left turn at albuquerque .
don' t start that again .
all right .
here' s the plan .
we wait here for the next truck or car or camel or whatever ... and take bugs and daffy ... get back to hollywood and finish making the movie .
what are you going to do ?
i' m just gonna keep walking that way .
that' s your plan ?
yep .
that' s the direction the car was going .
you' re not leaving me here while you make off with my diamond .
i don' t wanna get too wrapped up in your caper ... but let' s assume that you' re right and damian drake is a spy ?
super spy .
what' s the point of just meandering through the desert if ...
here .
be safe .
attaboy .
trust your instincts .
yeah .
except for the water tower , the batmobile , the rubble known as las vegas .
there' s nobody as rich , famous , and powerful as my father ... who just disappears into thin air .
suddenly i feel like i' m in aunt marge' s jell o mold .
guys , it' s air conditioned in here .
come on in .
intruder alert .
easy .
earth freak .
okay , buster .
where' s damian drake and that big diamond ?
cleanup on aisle three .
can i be of service ?
i am monitored to respond to the name robbie .
hi , d. j.
at ease .
i' m mother .
yeah , like the car said that we would be meeting you .
how do you know my name ?
d. j. , i' ve known you since you were this big .
that' s not really possible , is it ?
must have been a photo .
let me just take care of this , and we' il ...
give it to me straight .
how bad is it ?
so , shall we ?
so little to do , so much time .
you' re going to put him back , right ?
i can' t go back to l. a. with duck soup .
we do have the facilities to reconstitute the body .
the mind though , will remain a gooey mess .
so , about my father ?
all in due time .
lovely .
yes .
blow .
all right , break it up , fellas .
nice coats .
white is the new black , you know .
yes .
look .
so this is area 51 , right ?
no .
the secret military base where they keep the aliens ?
no , area 51 is actually a paranoid fantasy we concocted ... to hide the true identity of this facility .
which is ?
area 52 .
but don' t quote me on that .
oh , right .
area 52 .
so , mother ...
call me " mom .
mom , what is it that you do here exactly , anyway ?
creation , transubstantiation , destruction .
it' s stressful .
all kinds of things .
they' re already here .
you' re next .
my god ... what am i going to do with you ?
you' ve done nothing but screw up !
you' ve walked off mesas .
you' ve been smashed by boulders .
you' ve been run over by diesel trucks .
don' t blame the equipment .
it' s good .
it' s acme equipment .
you' re a coyote .
be wily .
all right , now .
buck up and let' s see a little smile .
little bigger .
that' s nice .
now , just go take a shower , and don' t come back till you smell better !
be careful .
there' re men moving a safe out there , and i don' t want you to ...
and be careful of the box of fireworks because ...
i suppose i should mention the plate glass window ...
it' s tough being the boss .
a communication .
memo to marvin the martian .
obtain the playing card , and destroy the duck .
and when i say destroy the duck , i mean kill him viciously and painfully .
a mission ?
i' m all a tingle .
so , here we are in the l can' t tell you what room .
robert , can you take care of that , please ?
yes , madam .
when you bring daffy back , could you make him 20 % funnier ?
i heard that .
what were we discussing ?
this isn' t about the giant ants , is it ?
giant ants ?
because they' re not really ants anymore .
tell me about the blue monkey .
how do you know about that thing that i' ve never heard of in my entire life ?
my dad told me .
what is the point of making them pinky swear ?
all right .
now this tape will explain everything .
it was prepared especially for your father .
greetings , damian drake .
if you are watching this , you are aware that the world is in grave danger .
the acme corporation is in hot pursuit of the blue monkey diamond ... a supernatural gem with the ability to turn people into monkeys ... and then back again .
it is the acme chairman' s goal to turn the population ... into monkey slaves to manufacture shoddy acme goods ... and then change them back to people to buy the stuff .
unbelievable .
unbelievable , you may say .
find it , destroy it , save humanity .
and remember , no one wants to be turned into a monkey .
so that' s why .
those guys came after my dad because he was going to save the world .
so that means if i go after the diamond , then the bad guys come after me .
hang on .
you' re not seriously thinking about ...
taking over your father' s mission ?
i guess that would be all right .
what ?
listen , if you' re going to be a spy , you' il need spy stuff .
so , is this where you keep all the high tech spy gadgets ?
yes .
that' s cool .
so i get to use all this stuff ?
no , your stuff is over here .
but i really like the ...
all right .
looks like an ordinary cell phone .
three way calling , voice dialing , downloadable ringtones .
my phone does all that .
superconducting electromagnet .
sorry .
it' s all right .
gps with mapping software ... tip calculator , gameboy .
gameboy ?
high powered laser .
polycarbonate rappelling line with jet propelled micro grappling hook .
nose hair trimmer .
you always want to look your best .

cold .
warm , warmer .
permit me , madam .

swank pants .
and comfortable , too .
plus , liquid hydrogen rocket pockets , here and here .
and stitching , nuclear powered crotch pad ...
he' il be down in a moment .
wakey , wakey , friends .
time to wreak mayhem in the cause of evil .
mother , just one last question .
what' s the deal with this card ?
that is the window into what lies behind her smile .
what ?
i' m sorry , our intelligence people feel a need to code everything in a riddle .
they get some kind of perverse pleasure out of it .
i think it' s corporate .
all humans .
looks like we got company .
illegal aliens .
exterminate them .

i knew this day would come .
let us exterminate them .
emergency shutdown activated .
force barrier seal in 30 seconds .

out of my way .
hero coming through .
there is no escape .
you pesky fowl !
isn' t it about time to enjoy a frosty , cold soda at the concession stand ?
exterminate !
get the lead out .
bus is leaving .
halt or be fricasseed .
that was fun .
looking for this ?
now , what did she mean by a window ?
the window into what lies behind her smile .
that' s the mona lisa .
which is in the louvre .
which is in paris .
just how are we supposed to get to paris ?
like this .
it doesn' t look like much of a window to me .
maybe the diamond is in the painting .
all we have to do is steal the mona lisa .
way ahead of you .
no , you look , you don' t touch , right ?
yeah .
but i' m already in costume .
that' s a good look for you .
do you think so ?
wait a minute .
it is a window .
it' s an x ray .
sorry .
it' s a map of africa .
maybe that' s where the diamond is .
hold it up .
i' il take a picture .

i want to take a picture , too .

no .
i said it' s the queen of diamonds , i tell you .
you mean , like this one ?
think we should go back and help him ?
elmer never gets bugs .
it' s a formula , but it works .
the great thing about movies , you always know what will happen .
for instance , if this was a movie ... you and i' d probably wind up together .
if you don' t let go of me , i' il scream ... but i' m not gonna stop screaming !
well , this is surreal .
stop or i' il fire .
hello .
oh , my .
ladies , please .
gendarme !

he' s got a woman .
she' s tied up in a burlap sack .
he' s taking her to the eiffel tower .
it is spring , is it not ?
i' m gonna blast you .
shucks .
a technique of using individual dots of pigment ...
which , taken together , make an image .
oh , crud .
i think when you go to the movies , you should learn something .
pardonnez moi .
excusez moi .
look at that clown here .
now , there' s something you don' t see every day .
you .
come here .
wait a minute .
i don' t want any trouble .

i just want your pants !
that' s right .
i' m a vicious bird of prey .
merci .
he' s got the camera !

what kept you ?
you okay ?
that was great .
i' d say it' s a perfect day .
except for the fact that we lost the map .

and i' m the bunny who saved the card .
voila .
nice going , bugs .
africa .
chair people , i reveal to you ... the whereabouts of the blue monkey .
all right .
there' s a duck in the middle of the map .
remove the duck .
remove the duck !
the duck is in the ...
duck !
we cannot let a boy , girl , duck , and rabbit thwart our plans for global domination .
wanna bet ?
a wager ? $5 says my son will scuttle your diabolical plans and save the world .
you' re awfully spunky for a man in your position .
how do you like that , mr. slap yourself in your own face ?
give him a good zets every once in a while .
my pleasure .
now , i think i' m going to hedge my bet .
i' m going to unleash our most vicious operative .
mr. chairman , while we agree that the tasmanian devil is quite vicious ... if memory serves , he is also really stupid .
really ?
so are you .
that' s a good boy .
i withdraw my objection .
this would have been a lot easier underground .
come on , it' s only another 6, 000 cubits in this here thick direction .
look , granny , it' s that nice boy from next door .
little damian .
how funny seeing you here , dear .
hi , granny .
would you and your little friends like a lift ?
giddyup , dumbo .
sure was a lucky coincidence you showing up just now .
yes , wasn' t it ?
i' ve discovered my roots .
i' ve discovered my lunch .
cry freedom !
what a fantastic view .
unless you' re in the audience ... in which case you' ve been staring at an elephant' s behind for 30 seconds .
my destiny awaits .
i guess this is our stop .
enjoy the rest of your adventure , children .
this is the blue monkey ?
this dime store bauble ?
i' ve been rooked .
shafted by the gods .
nice going , daffy .
i demand recompense .
i want my diamond .
where is my humongous rock ?
pressed duck .
this looks like a puzzle piece .
what ?
wait a minute .
are we rich yet ?
any time now .
i' m rich .
i' m affluent .
my liquidity is assured .
daffy , get back here .
don' t touch that !
let go !
don' t you dare !
the rock is mine .
so close .
you mind ?
yes , i mind .
i' m the hero .
i should get the treasure .
the girl , too , but we' il discuss that later .
careful with my diamond .
easy , now .
dad , this is for you .
why , d. j. , why you ?
why wasn' t it me ?
just academic curiosity , you understand .
gotta go .
bank closes at 5 : 00 .
come on , daffy , change him back .
all right .
buddy pictures .
d. j. , pal , you' re okay .
yeah .
give me that .
i liked you better as a monkey .
thanks .
that is so sweet .
now if you could just hand over the diamond .
immediately !
my turn .
pardon .
all right , now , i' ve come for the diamond .
i knew it was you .
you knew it was me , did you ?
you' re wrong .
because i' m not me .
i' m actually ...
i can' t .
i can' t reach over the hat .
i' d rehearse back at acme , but i never wore the hat .
and now the hat is throwing me off .
would you ...
thank you very much .
now , i' m actually ...
your father .
dad .
saw that one coming .
look into your heart , d. j.
you know it' s true .
no , it can' t be true .
you' re right , it isn' t .
let' s do some drills .
this doesn' t make a lick of sense .
well , who' s laughing now ?
apparently , no one .
anyway , give me the monkey !
no , forget that , man .
you' re evil .
thank you , but ...
anyway , mr. smith , let' s show this muscle bound beefcake ... who i have sometimes been mistaken for ... what it' s like to live in the real world .
have you ever been disintegrated in one place and then reassembled in another ?
fire away .
no , you don' t !
i thought they fixed that glitch .
mr. smith is fired !
i have to do everything myself around here .
good .
you ...
henchmen .
dad .
so this is the remote that works .
this , my friend , is the acme train of death ... which is not good news for your father .
don' t worry about me , son .
i' ve gotten out of worse scrapes than this one .
you see , if the train of death doesn' t kill him ... then those crates of tnt will .
not to mention the 2 ton anvil hanging over his head .
and look .
there' s the pendulum of doom .
what' s the pendulum of doom doing there ?
i did not order it .
it' s overkill .
get rid of it .
now , if you want to keep your family " together " ...
i would hand over the blue monkey now .
don' t worry , son .
i' m fine .
you' re a sick man , you know that ?
get used to it .
excuse me ?
what about my father ?
he' s waiting for a train .
what ?
you ...
where' s marvin the martian ?
all right , here is the blue monkey .
go put it on the satellite .
go !
no , you don' t , eight ball .
you' d never catch that rabbit being this heroic .
what' s up , doc ?
you' re despicable .
vandals .
your friends ' efforts will prove to be futile .
you see , here is the blue monkey , here is the acme satellite .
when the blue monkey is finally docked in the satellite ...
i will transmit a beam around the world ... which will transform everyone but me into monkeys .
now take them away !
don' t you think that' il get ionely ...
mr. all my friends swing from trees and pick fleas out of their furry butts ?
lonely ?
i suppose i could use a little human companionship .
thanks a lot .
i' ve seen you notice me .
i know i' m hot .
but i prefer someone with a little more oomph .
i prefer mary !
hello , mary .
we' re a cute couple , don' t you think ?
take those future simians away and lower the monkey shield .
earthlings have the worst sense of direction .
what do you know , he fell for it .
i guess i owe you $5 .
did you order satellite ?
i don' t even have cable .
you know , when i fired that duck ...
i never would have seen this coming .
gotta be a way out of this .
you can get out of this , son .
you' ve just got to set your mind to it .
besides , i' m hearing my dad' s voice in my head .
actually , i' m down here , son .
hold on , dad , i' il be right down !
that was too easy .
what was that noise , son ?
you know how i always wanted a dog ?
yeah ?
i just got one .
wait .
maybe he wants to play fetch .
nice mechanical doggy .
good dog .
want to play ?
good boy .
fetch !
it looks to be a deadly mission requiring strength ... cunning and nerves of steel .
so good luck , bugsy , i' il keep the engine running .
you tricked me !
what' s up , darth ?
now i must incapacitate you with my bubble gun .
ain' t that cute ?
of course you realize this means war .
you go that way .
i' m gonna go this way .
bad dog !
sit !
i don' t want to put you under any added pressure ... but judging by the vibrations of these train tracks , i' ve got about ... one minute and forty two seconds left .
down !
put him down .
what am i gonna do ?
what would damian drake do ?
what would duck dodgers do ?
wait a minute .
i am duck dodgers !
yes , i' m going to be the hero of this picture !
duck dodgers to the rescue !
duck ...
it' s you know who to the rescue !
it helps if you don' t say the name .
bad dog !
disgusting earth rodent .
now to neutralize that duck .
this can' t be good .
now the diamond will bathe the earth in a monkey transforming glow .
ten , nine , eight , seven ... six , five , four ... three , two , one .
thwarting evil makes me so angry .
that takes care of that .
thanks , daff .
darn dark side !
are you all monkeys yet ?
checkmate , mr. chairman .
you' re going down .
come on , say it .
just a little " you' re my hero " ?
nope , sorry .
bugs , say it , come on .
not interested .
no one will ever know .
i' m really proud of you , d. j.
i knew i could count on you .
yes .
dad , i think we should move .
what was wrong with beverly hills ?
i meant from this spot .
i think we scratched it .
don' t worry , it' s a rental .
you guys , you pulled it off !
you pulled it off , all right .
give me that .
way to go , daffy .
you didn' t do so bad yourself , stunt boy .
to set the record straight ... all credit for saving the human race goes to daffy .
exactly .
oh , no , you don' t , buster .
you' re the hero .
wait a minute .
pronoun trouble .
i' m the hero .
i' m the hero , all right .
are you gonna introduce us , d. j. ?
dad , this is kate .
kate , this is ...
damian drake .
i' m a really big fan ... of your son .
daff , you achieved your goal of being a hero .
yep , but you didn' t achieve your goal ... of getting me back in your stupid movie .
cut .
great , that' s a wrap .
that' s it , guys .
remind me to get a new agent , will you ?
thanks .
wait a minute .
maybe we are a team .
bugs and daffy .
no , daffy and bugs .
what do you think ?
excuse me , do you remember me ?
i threatened your manliness , and you got me fired ?
i know you .
do i know him ?
you must be someone that i got fired .
see , i get a lot of people fired .
you be good now .
so like i said ...
not again .
he' s down again .
are you okay ?
come on .
he said he can do stunts .
bugs is here .
gotta go .
daffy , you' re right .
the usual place , mr. bunny ?
very good .
from now on , you and i are going to be equal partners in this thing .
no more second banana for you .
thanks , pal .
i really appreciate this .
at last my star is rising .
all my hopes and aspirations ...
what do you know ?
my luck is changing already .
go home , folks .
