he' s gonna be one of those grown men living with their mother .
your next one will be better .
think you' il get one of each ?
no .
we' re not gonna have a next one .
he' s in our bed every night .
oh , i' d love to see them .
doyou think they could come out ?
yeah .
we' il see .
so , tell me more about what the police said .
it was questions mostly .
wanted to know if anything had been bothering him recently .
apparently , people wander off all the time .
they said that ?
they said they were going to check the river .
oh , that' s not dad .
no .
wayne !
wayne .
yeah .
hi , wayne .
hi .
i don' t know if you remember me arnold .

let' s have your shoes .
now tell your wife you' re all right .

yes .
this is wayne .
eileen , i' m fine .
jill !
the possibility that they' re watching the house ... is something we have to take seriously .
that means we' il set up surveillance and stay with you until the situation is resolved .
they' ve instructed you to confirm receipt of the keys in a personal ad .
that' s a common mode of communication minimal contact .
we' d obviously like to get them on the phone ... so we' il monitor all calls in the event that we' re successful in doing that .
i understand that our presence here is an imposition on you ... but i need to ask all of you ... to try to be as open with us as you can be .
so if mr. hayes mentioned anything something on his mind , something bothering him any information you can give us , the better off we are .
i want to assure you ... that our first priority is mr. hayes' s safety .
in a situation like this , lack of control can be the hardest part .
we' re here to get you back some of that control .
hello .
where have you been ?
talking to lane .
how is she ?
we spent most of the time discussing the color of what' s in oscar' s diapers .
hope the f. b. i. found it interesting .
how' s mom ?
she' s okay .
i think she thought he left her .
did she tell you that ?
no .
of course not .
he would never do that .
why not ?
' cause he' d be lost without her .
he might think about it , but he' d never do it .
uh , most kidnappings in this country are small in scale usually over disagreements about drugs .
they usually work themselves out .
someone pays the bill , and on they go .
we' re free .
we' il be on our way in five minutes .

put those on , please .
sit down .
all the way .
put your butt down .

pepsi for breakfast ?
one of those bad habits .
everything will be paid for by the bureau , by the way .
i don' t know if that was explained to you .
oh , no .
that that' s all right .
you have a wonderful place here .
yes .
we built it about five no , six years ago .
hmm .
i hope we' re not getting in your way too much .
no .
i think we' il be all right .
good .
well , enjoy your breakfast .
thank you .
it' s good once you' re in .
it' s cold .
keeps you young .
ahh .
you know , i can' t remember the last time we swam together .
yeah .
it' s been a while .
cigarette ?
i quit .
but under the circumstances
the shoes all right ?
i mean , they fit okay ?
yeah .
they' re they' re fine .
no , no .
those things are killers .
i' ve been telling my wife that for years , but somehow
are we gonna have a conversation now ?
is that it ?
okay .
i don' t need to talk .
what made you think i smoked ?
look , arnold .
how much are we talking about here ?
i could call my lawyer , whatever it is .
can' t do it .
this has nothing to do with me .
i' m just doing my part .
what what is your part ?
i' m doing it .
this is my part .
did you take the pictures ?
no .
i' m not a photographer .
we should really get going .
we got a long way to go .
mind telling me where that is ?
i' m sorry .
i can' t .
mind telling me where that is ?
i' m sorry .
i can' t .
were there any disagreements that you can remember off hand ?
with former employees , any unpleasant departures , grudges ... someone who may feel they were owed something ?
anything like that ?
no .
not that i know of .
as i understand it , there was some anger over your husband' s use of foreign automobiles ?
oh , that was just a few letters .
that was all .
hmm .
about a year after he sold primary control in the car rental business ... he resigned from the board and formed a new company .
is that right ?
that' s right .
a consulting firm ?
yes .
but it wasn' t successful .
no .
so he' s been advisory director at lennox stuart ... for the past two years since he closed the consulting firm ?
that' s right .
do you know a miss louise miller ... formerly in the employment of your husband at lennox stuart ?
yes .
my husband had an affair with her .
and she left your husband' s employment in j une of 2001 ?
i told him to let her go .
oh .
and as far as you know , that was the end of the relationship ?
yes , as far as i know .
your husband' s phone records indicate ... that they were in regular contact beyond that date .
is that all ?
sure .
that' s it for now .
thankyou .
my children don' t know about this .
i' d appreciate it if you didn' t tell them .
i understand .
ham or tuna ?
ham .
we' il split it .
thank you .
you know , arnold , i think you may have the wrong man .
oh , yeah ?
yeah .
i think you want my neighbor mr. shipley .
he' s loaded .
you think i made a mistake ?
happens all the time .
perfectly intelligent people pick up a wrong bag at the airport ...
get into a car that doesn' t belong to them  i know all about you .
the man hertz and avis are afraid of .
oh , i see .
you grew up in altoona .
you married your high school sweetheart .
you won a scholarship to penn state .
you had a good job , but you quit to start a car rental business .
didn' t make sense at the time , but you made it work .
in those days , the greatest challenge was keeping your marriage together .
they wrote that .
i didn' t say it .
you like to watch the pirates .
you have a little house on a lake in the woods ... a small boat in which you like to float on summer afternoons to clear your mind ... and two children a son and daughter all grown up now .
that about sums it up .
so , when did you lose your job ?
i guess it' s obvious , huh ?
eight years ago in november .
and what did you do ?
i was a manager ofsorts .
and you thought if you were hardworking and loyal ... and did everything they told you to do that you' d be safe , right ?
i worked there 17 years .
out of their hands , they said .
well , it probably was .
that' s what they said .
changing economy .
gotta keep things profitable .
i' ve heard it all .
nothing personal .
yeah , right .
it' s a terrible thing .
a lot of good people lost their jobs .
i' d say 30 % of our workforce at one point was from hadley .
you could have come work for us .
i' d appreciate it if you didn' t condescend me , wayne .
i know how the world works .
that' s why i' m out here with you .
so , what does your wife think about this plan ?
my wife ?
yeah .
those are her cigarettes .
you can keep things from your wife .
i don' t know .
what ?
you' ve never deceived your wife ?
well , there are levels of deception , arnold .
i mean , this is a whopper .
oh .
well , how about you ?
me ?
yeah .
you know everything about me .
tell me about yourself .
all right .
uh ...
i have a wife and two daughters .
one of my daughters supposedly lives with us .
she' s got some boyfriend .
i think he' s a mute .
i can' t tell you the last time i saw her .
my wife ... is trying to kill herself with cigarettes .
we live with her father .
he sleeps in the den .
he has his own tv , but he' s hard of hearing ... and he doesn' t like to wear his hearing aids at night .
so he lies in bed and plays it so loud , we can hear it in our room .
sometimes he leaves it on all night .
but what can i say ?
it' s his house .
i don' t say anything much at all , wayne .
it' s a household of ... disappointed people .
but ... we have our health , and we have each other , so
ah , everybody suffers .
isn' t that right ?
yeah , everybody suffers .
did you always have that mustache ?
so long as i could grow one .
this is wayne .
eileen , i' m fine .
our profilers believe the letters are probably being written by one person male , some college education , white , over 30 but we do believe we' re dealing with a group .
to keep a hostage for a prolonged period requires multiple participants .
why haven' t they asked for anything ?
they' re showing you who' s in control .
i' d like to suggest a different approach .
they' ve made no acknowledgement of our request to communicate over the phone ... so i propose we place a personal ad ... confirming you received the recording as requested ... but we also claim you received a ransom demand .
you' re willing to pay .
you just want to make sure you' re paying the right people .
as soon as they think you' re gonna give their money to someone else ... they usually call within 24 hours .
okay , so we' re agreed .
we do what fuller says .
well , i' m not gonna make this decision alone .
you' re not alone , sweetheart .
where are you going ?
i' m going to get something for oscar .
you' re going shopping ?
it' s his first birthday .
it' s important we celebrate it .
are you coming ?
oscar !
is he asleep ?
finally .
he woke up the minute i put him down .
wayne will be sorry to have missed it .
yeah .
he loves birthdays .
you know , lane , for my first birthday after wayne and i were married ... he wanted to give me a surprise , so we drove up to this little hotel in the mountains .
we could not afford it , but he insisted , as usual .
anyway , when we got there , they' d never heard of us .
he messed up the reservations or something .
anyway , he was devastated , so he oh , he pleaded .
and then he tried to sound important , but they took no pity on us .
poor dad .
so anyway , we finished up at an all night diner ... because there were no hotel rooms available .
but he made them put candles in everything we ate in the rice pudding , in the in the hamburgers .
and they all sang " happy birthday . " it was great .
i remember once , he convinced me that it was a special birthday treat ... to go to work with him and help him clean the cars .
i fell for that too .
you loved it .
both of you .
he really made you feel like you were the center of the world .
i hope oscar gets to feel that .
he will .
hold it .
is this where we meet the others ?
no .
what then ?
just a break .
you can sit over there .
oh , yeah .
may i see the pictures of my wife ?
what for ?
may i see them ?
she' d hate the idea of being watched .
she' s self conscious , even with me .
she' s beautiful .
you know what i think ?
what ?
i don' t think there' s anybody watching my wife .
and do you know what that means ?
no .
it means i' m gonna have to give you the slip .
you won' t wanna do that , wayne .
you' d get me into a world of trouble .
i' d be sorry about that .
anyway , your wife will pay , and then you can go home .
as long as she wants you back .
you haven' t done anything terrible , have you ?
i' ve never pointed a gun at anyone .
does your wife know about the company you keep ?
that woman ?
i told you i know all about you .
i followed you there once .
i sat outside .
you followed me ?
they asked me to .
i' d say that' s a whopper , wayne .
isn' t that a whopper ?
we should get going .
oh , this is a beautiful spot , arnold .
you picked a great day for it .
i didn' t pick it .
let' s go , wayne .
i love my wife , arnold .
we have two beautiful kids , and i' m just getting to know them .
for most of their lives , i' ve been working .
i missed a lot .
i' m not suggesting you didn' t love them .
come on .
let' s go .
no .
come on .
this will do just fine .
tell me where we' re going .
let' s go .
look at yourself .
you' ve lost your job .
you go around pushing people into trunks
get up .
what if everybody did that ?
you goddamn lunatic .
how many times have you fired that gun , arnold ?
there' s a hunting cabin near the top .
i' m gonna drop you off .
then i go .
that' s it .
there' s some guys waiting for you .
i work for them .
they' re okay .
i wish i' d paid better attention , but i was mowing the lawn .
all i remember is , he wasn' t a gardener .
he was white , middle aged , i guess .
he was wearing a suit , i think ... and he was standing at the side of the car talking to mr. hayes .
a driver from one of the local bus routes remembers a man of similar description .
we' ve come up with a composite sketch based on those descriptions .
here you go .
does that resemble anyone you might know ?
yeah , it resembles a million people i might know .
what about the personal ad ?
there' s still no response .
as they have so far refused to make phone contact , with your permission ...
i would like to demand an assurance of mr. hayes' s safety .
i think an organization as disciplined as this would expect such a demand .
wait a minute .
mr. fuller , at your suggestion ... we threatened to give their money to someone else .
and since then , they haven' t contacted us .
they' ve made no demand .
if anything , we' re further from resolving this than we were to begin with !
what difference does it make who was on the goddamn bus ?
you know what i think ?
i think you don' t have the faintest fucking idea who those people are !
so , what would you consider an assurance ?
a phone conversation .
if they' re not willing to confirm your husband' s safety ...
i think we should consider the negotiation over .
come here .
mrs. hayes , if they can make you desperate ... they know you' il give them anything they want .
i want to apologize for my son .
that' s not necessary .
please , sit down .
you know , it' s strange .
you' ve never met my husband , but you know all about him .
i' m i' m used to it .
you' d like him .
he inspires confidence .
it' s his great talent .
a man like that needs to be appreciated .
it gets worse as they get older .
they feel themselves being forgotten .
you don' t have to explain anything to me
i' m trying to explain my husband , mr. fuller .
did you tell my son about that woman ?
i asked him to look over some phone records .
i don' t know what conclusions he came up with .
you said you wouldn' t .
i said that i understood .
how would it be if i looked into your marriage ?
it wouldn' t look very good at the moment .
what are you doing ?
i was ... thinking about dad .
i' m frightened i' m never gonna see him again .
what would you say to him if you could ?
that i love him .
you know ... when i told him that i was pregnant with you ... that' s the only time i' ve ever seen him cry .
he knows you love him .
these guys waiting for us have i done something to them ?
no .
and you you seem to know a lot about me .
have i done something to you ?
no , you haven' t done anything to me .
you' re good with names .
you' re famous for it , you know ?
i read somebody can meetyou once ... and you see them again 10 years later ... and you greet them as if you saw them every day of your life .
that way , you manage to make each and every person feel important .
fortune magazine .
to be honest , i' m not surprised you don' t remember me .
give me a minute .
i started at hadley a few months before you left .
one day i was walking down the hallway .
you were walking the other way .
the man i was with pointed you out and said , " that' s the guy to watch .
we met in the cafeteria a few days later .
i introduced myself .
we talked for a while , actually .
i wanted to see what the hotshot was like .
that was a stressful period in my life .
you can' t blame me for not remembering .
you were very gracious .
don' t worry .
you bought me a cup of coffee , and we talked .
i think actually we saw eye to eye on quite a few things .
i think you might' ve enjoyed talking with someone of like mind for once .
and you kept up with me ?
in the papers ?
like the man said , i watched you .
like the man said .
and that' s it ?
that' s why it' s me ?
let' s go , wayne .
i worked hard my whole life .
everything i' ve got i' ve earned .
nobody handed it to me .
i don' t deserve this .
what
you all right ?
i think that was my wife .
i have something for that .
here .
i i' m sorry .
i didn' t mean to hurt you .
so , what' s the plan when you' re done here ?
i' m going away .
some place hot ?
that' s right .
i' m taking my wife away from here .
get back to the way you were ?
that' s right .
i see .
so , she' il go with you ?
of course she will .
give up everything for you ?
leave her father behind and the kids ?
they' il be all right .
she' il miss them .
you can' t go back , arnold .
my wife doesn' t look at me the way she did 30 years ago .
nothing you can do about that .
is there , um , any news about wayne ?
no .
you know , the f. b. i. came to , um to speak to me .
i don' t know how anyone could be so cruel .
when did you see him last ?
it was a while ago .
i didn' t i didn' t know he' d started seeing you again .
i' m sorry .
what was it like when he was here ?
i want to know .
did he bring you things ?
were you in bed ?
sometimes he' d he' d bring me things .
what things ?
he brought me that book .
he hates new york .
oh .
i' ve never been .
you know , when i left the company ... he helped me with this place .
and then he just started coming around now and then ... you know , to see how i was .
we were here for each other .
i think i' d prefer if you' d been fucking in hotels .
you know , eileen ...
i don' t know what i would' ve done without him .
he' s a great man .
i went to see her .
i know .
you know , i never talked to him about it .
i never asked him why .
i just told him to get rid of her , and we got on with our life .
i i didn' t want to know .
i love him , and she admires him .
they may allow your husband to watch the news .
fuck .
what are you doing ?
i' m tired , arnold .
there' s a stream up ahead .
you can soak your feet in the water .
it' il feel good .
how long you been married ?
twenty four years .
she stood by you ?
yes .
you' re a lucky man .
would you do something for me ?
would you mail a letter for me , to my wife ?
you could mail it when you go home .
i might not get along too well with the guys at the cabin ... and i' d like to tell her something .
you can do that for me .
oh , shit .
would you
please , could you cut me free ?
you can read what i write .
i won' t say anything about you or where we are .
be careful where you mail it ... so they can' t trace the postmark .
after we were married andshe was pregnant with tim ... she sometimes had this feeling when i would walk out of a room ...
like maybe i wasn' t coming back .
i traveled a lot with the businesses then and
i think she got over it .
i don' t
i don' t think she suffered much .
when i asked her to marry me ...
i wasn' t completely sure .
i had my doubts .
but i
i couldn' t imagine my life without her .
that' s never changed .
i think that' s the same ... as being sure .
you think ?
i don' t know .
i think it is .
we can go now .
we have a demand .
do you recognize these ?
the demand comes to approximately $10 million .
they' ve requested that you , eileen , deliver the ransom .
it' s 9 . 5 in diamonds , two carat , round d flawless .
they' re the most common stones in the market , easy for them to move .
and half a million in cash , nonsequential $100 bills .
why do they want my mother to go ?
we can' t send an agent in her place .
they know what she looks like .
they' ve requested that we put the ransom in wayne' s sports bag .
the lining' s too thin for us to put in a tracking device of any range .
i have to advise you not to pay the ransom ... without confirmation that your husband is all right .
eileen , they' ve given us three days to get the stones together .
tell them you need more time .
tell them you need proof that your husband is alive .
do you know how you do something ... completely beyond the realm of your normal behavior ?
how ?
you imagine it , every piece ofit ... until it feels real , like something you do all the time .
i wasn' t nervous this morning .
it was like driving to work .
the sky , the weather i knew what it was gonna be ... even before i opened my eyes .
they offered me money , real money .
and all i have to do is bring you to them .
tell me , wayne ... if you were in my shoes , wouldn' t you do it ?
no , i wouldn' t .
you have any idea what it' s like to see your wife go to work every day ... instead of float in her pool ?
no , i don' t .
well , it stinks , wayne .
it stinks seeing your life fall apart .
everything you planned for , everything you counted on ... to see it happen in front of you and not be able to do anything about it ... as if you' d become invisible .
you don' t know what i' m talking about , do you ?
do you ?
my mother was sick when i was growin ' up .
father worked in a mill just like everybody else .
he should have done something else with his life ... but he ... accepted his place in the world .
people would come around and try to get him to settle their arguments .
whatever the argument ... he was above it .
he knew everything .
it' s a nice story , wayne .
hey , goddamn it , listen to me !
i listened to you .
when he got sick ... they' d come around the house , stand by the bed ... and try to brighten his mood .
and after he died ... they raised a glass to him , came by the house , see if they could help .
and even though he was dead ... it was like he ... hung around .
now , all of a sudden , he really was dead .
he might not have lived for anybody , except my sick mother and me .
just the two of us .
but we missed him .
really missed him .
i don' t know that i' ve even got that .
so all you have to do is just take me to them .
do you think they' re gonna let me go once they know i' ve seen your face ?
and what do you think they' re gonna do about you ?
they' re gonna let you go ?
it' il be all right , wayne .
no , it won' t .
no , it won' t .
you don' t understand , wayne .
i understand .
look at you .
you don' t even have any shoes on .
i understand there' s plenty of people like you .
you think this is for your wife ?
you think if you steal my money ... go away to a beach someplace , your life won' t be such a goddamn waste .
this is for you , arnold .
and this is what you amount to .
because the truth is you can' t make it yourself .
and to think that my family is gonna suffer because of you .
you' re a piece of shit !
you' re a miserable piece of shit .
you have no right to speak to me like that .
shut up .
just take me towhoever it is you work for .
i' m done with you .
this is your final chance .
thursday , 1 : 00 p . m .
the exact location will appear in a personal ad on the day of the drop .
do not involve the f. b. i.
what is it ?
it' s blood .
let' s get this to the lab for analysis .
can you grab some evidence bags ?
according to the lab report , the white blood cells in wayne' s blood ... have begun to expand to an unsafe size .
what does that mean ?
it' s not a conclusive indication that wayne is alive .
