one minute , 47 seconds , sir .
not too shabby , sir .
but dead , 007 .
dead !
you should have studied the plot more carefully .
fanatical revolutionaries kidnap a millionaire' s daughter .
of course she could have been brainwashed .
could have turned .
evidently she did .
with due respect , sir ,
i played for two weeks and i only got killed once .
twice .
the land mine on the black sea beach .
i lost both legs .
i did not die .
you were immobilised .
it can never be the same playing with blanks .
it is somewhat different in the field .
with your life on the line , you ...
well , your adrenaline gives you an edge .
is your edge sharp ?
that' s the difference between a double 0 and a corpse .
since you took over , sir , you' ve had little use for the double 0s .
i' ve spent most of my time teaching ,
not doing .
oh , i' il make you no secret .
i hold your methods in much less regard than my illustrious predecessor did .
but my duty is to keep you up to par .
too many free radicals , that' s your problem .
free radicals , sir ?
toxins that destroy the body and brain .
caused by eating too much red meat and white bread , and too many dry martinis .
then i shall cut out the white bread , sir .
you' il do more than that , 007 .
from now on , you will be suffering a strict regimen of diet and exercise .
we shall purge those toxins from you .
shrublands ?
you' ve got it .
have you got an assignment , james ?
yes .
yes , moneypenny .
i' m to eliminate all free radicals .
do be careful .
welcome to shrublands , sir .
thank you .
my word .
they don' t make them like this any more .
it' s still in pretty good shape .
this way , sir .
your body' s got enough scar tissue for an entire regiment .
right ...
but it' s still in pretty good shape .
we' il be the judge of that , mr bond .
our job is not just to rehabilitate you .
it' s to re educate you .
i want to open your mind to the virtues of nutrition , proper exercise , meditation and , hopefully , spiritual enlightenment .
i' d like you to see the iridologist at four , have a colonic at five and then you can cut along to the light dining room for a cup of parsley tea .
mr bond , i need a urine sample .
if you could fill this beaker for me ...
from here ?
bonjour .
box 274 and quickly , please .
ah , oui .
suivez moi .
we have invested extensively in the middle east and central america to promote insurgency and revolution .
fortunately our capital outlay has been handsomely offset by the resultant sales of armaments and missiles .
you will note that we have supplied both rebels and government forces on an equal basis .
in matters of death , spectre is strictly impartial .
now for the future .
spectre' s most audacious enterprise of any , next to which our previous ventures are inconsequential .
our esteemed number one is in complete charge of the entire operation , which will henceforth be called " the tears of allah " .
he will now join us .
according to plans , an american air force officer has been introduced to a cruel mistress : heroin .
i understand he is now our willing and obedient servant .
a surgical operation has been performed on him .
as a result of a corneal implant , his right eye print is an exact replica of that of the president of the united states .
he will soon be moved to a convalescent clinic near london .
i have chosen number 12 to have the responsibility of taking the most tenderloving care of captain jack petachi .
i beg your pardon .
is there no speed limit here ?
she' s not staff .
she must be one of those private nurses .
my name is bond .
oh , you' re mr bond !
i believe i' m having you in half an hour .
oh , splendid !
your room or mine ?
mine .
that' s it .
ok , now just move back on the couch for me , please .
that' s it .
let' s have this arm on the shoulder .
this one ... no , underneath there .
good .
ok , now just relax .
yes , there are slight lesions of the thoracic vertebrae .
now , if you just hold still ...
yes .
some sacroiliac strain at the base of the spine .
there is a more beneficial therapy for a man' s lower back .
oh , really ?
mm .
and what might that be ?
i thought i' d ... surprise you , james .
well , you have .
come in .
no , no .
i can' t come in .
you know if they found me here they' d fire me on the spot .
i won' t let anyone find you .
don' t worry .
i have my reputation to think of .
i don' t think you got your reputation by living on a diet of wild rice .
so ...
lentil delight .
dandelion salad .
goat' s cheese .
beluga caviar .
quail' s eggs .
vodka .
foie gras .
strasbourg .
in question time at the house of commons , the minister said that local authorities should be given far wider ...
jack' s been smoking again !
jack was ordered not to smoke .
smoking is dirty .
it gets into jack' s eye .
jack must do as he' s told if he wants his fast cars and his pretty clothes .
and if he wants to keep his sister alive ...
you leave domino out of this !
mmm .
james ?
get up !
now let' s just take a look , shall we ?
ah !
very good .
with a contact lens both eyes will look exactly the same .
now , darling must do his little trickie in eight seconds .
then nursie will give baby his candy .
mm ?
p ... three ... four ... one ...
come on , jack !
oh , damn !
try it again , darling !
who' s that ?
a man !
at the window !
don' t move .
did he see you ?
i don' t know .
i guess he could have .
do you know him ?
oh , yes !
007 .
good morning , mr bond .
miss fearing tells me you' re making fine progress .
oh , yes .
but i must say , you' re looking a bit peaked this morning .
i was up all night .
don' t overdo it .
a herbal enema should fix you up .
thank you ...
sounds terrific !
i' il be done in a minute .
heavy , mr bond ?
let' s try again .
through the defensive walls ... he shoots ...
it' s there !
you lunatics !
i send you to a health farm to get yourself in shape .
instead you demolish it !
i' ve had to notify the local police , pull out the special branch , muzzle the press and allocate a large chunk of my meagre budget to renovating the establishment !
a man did try to kill me , sir .
caught you seducing his wife , did he ?
no , sir , not at all .
but i lost four pounds and god knows how many free radicals .
that is the kind of attitude that tempts me to suspend you , 007 !
this test assesses distance and accuracy of cruise missile release from the support country .
these alcms , with dummy warheads , will go from terrain following to inertial guidance , over water , toward the target .
we hope !
stand by .
countdown is go for dummy warhead loading and b 1 flight .
let' s hope we never have to use the real thing .
all right , men , this is it .
let' s make it a good one .
mr president , please stand by while authority for this procedure is confirmed by eye print check .
if confirmation is not authenticated within eight seconds , the base will be sealed .
eight ... seven ...  six ... five ...
come on !
four ... three ... two ...
come on !
one .
thank you .
presidential authority is confirmed for change of test procedure .
dummy warheads will be replaced by w 80 thermonuclear device .
have a nice day .
jack !
bravo !
no !
no !
ooh , my poor angel !
my sweet baby !
mr kovacs , how much longer ?
they' re coming .
they' re almost in range .
safety officer to base .
radar confirms both missiles on descent trajectory .
what the hell' s going on here ?
they' ve got maximum thrust .
about to cross minimum cruise height .
descending below minimum height ...
damn !
we' ve lost ' em !
we' ve got them !
well , kovacs ?
the fish are netted .
put them on ice .
i am supreme commander of spectre , the special executive for counterintelligence ,
terrorism , revenge and extortion .
yesterday morning the american air force launched two cruise missiles from swadley airbase in great britain .
through the ingenuity of spectre , the dummy warheads they carried were replaced with live nuclear warheads .
your weapons of destruction are now safely in our possession and will be moved to two secret targets .
please note the serial numbers of the missiles .
they will confirm the truth .
your weapons of deterrence did not deter us from our objective .
a terrible catastrophe now confronts you .
however , it can be avoided by paying a tribute to our organisation , amounting to 25 % of your respective countries ' annual oil purchases .
terror and extortion .
revenge .
that would be $25 billion a year !
order !
this would destabilise the monetary system !
i call this meeting to order !
the foreign secretary wishes to address you !
lord ambrose .
gentlemen , we are faced with the ultimate nightmare : the abduction of nuclear warheads .
but how is this possible ?
up to now , our procedures relating to nuclear hardware have been absolutely foolproof .
i hope the american government realises its awesome responsibility in this matter !
nato has a joint responsibility to solve this problem .
but if this gets out , it will cause worldwide panic !
how well has this information been contained ?
apart from those present in this room , the information resides only with the cla and british lntelligence .
wonderful !
that means by now it' s all over the kremlin !
i know your feelings , m , but i insist you reactivate the double 0s .
as you wish , sir .
maximillian largo , born bucharest , 1945 .
industrialist and philanthropist .
resident nassau , bahamas .
no known criminal associations .
you still here , moneypenny ?
you should be in bed .
james , we both should be .
instead i' m looking everywhere for you .
forget that .
m wants to see you right now .
it' s panic stations upstairs .
he' s been with the prime minister all day .
i think you' re back in business , james .
morning , gentlemen .
morning !
the latest reports ?
everything ok ?
yes , sir .
morning .
morning , charles .
in secret , the americans are trying to trace the missile on their eastern seaboard .
the other allegedly threatens the oilfields of the middle east .
how well protected are they from the air ?
everyone' s collaborating .
the americans , nato , the japanese ...
they' re putting up an air screen a mosquito couldn' t get through .
our concern is that the warhead may already be in position .
the worst devastation would result from a subterranean explosion .
you see , the oil bearing strata in the area ...
interconnected by a surprisingly delicate structure .
it would be a sort of ripple effect .
what' s the americans ' story on how the damn things were stolen ?
the release of alcms has to come from the president .
even that has safeguards .
it can only be authorised after a scan of his right eye .
the only irregularity is that a communications officer unofficially left the base at the time of launch .
a certain captain jack petachi .
if this petachi was involved , is it conceivable that he could have used a false eye ?
oh , do come along , bond !
let' s think of a more logical explanation , shall we ?
ok , let' s run through that routine from yesterday .
let' s go again .
ok .
four , five , six , seven , down .
max !
as usual , i have left you alone too long , i know .
but i brought you a gift .
i don' t want any more gifts .
i just want you .
that' s all i want .
i know , but this is different .
look .
look .
oh , max !
what is it ?
it' s very old .
oh !
what' s the inscription ?
arabic .
the tears of allah .
the story is that the prophet wept for the barrenness of the desert
and his tears made a well .
mmm .
it' s a legend , of course , but like all great legends , it is also the truth .
it is the most valuable thing ...
i have ever possessed .
except you .
hmmm .
and you trust me to wear it ?
a safer place i couldn' t imagine .
and what if i ever leave you ?
no , really !
then i cut your throat .
nice to know even old q can surprise one of you double 0s occasionally .
algernon !
not quite perfected yet .
you could write a very binding contract with this .
yeah , i wish i had a new contract .
they' ve slashed my budget .
you can' t get the spare parts .
and when you can , some strike stops delivery .
and look at this place !
they keep it bloody freezing down here !
plays havoc with my sinuses .
we' re both humble servants of the crown .
if the cla made me an offer , i' d be off like a shot .
unlimited resources , air conditioning , 28 flavours of ice cream in the restaurant .
it' s a motorbike toy .
if i can get the thing to work properly , i' il ship it out to you .
wait a minute !
i' ve got something in here that could be useful .
the prototype came from a kgb defector .
bit of a whiz kid in their technical section .
not a bad chap , though like all defectors , prone to melancholy .
i suppose it' s all that vodka and english weather .
ah .
rather tasty , this is .
it looks like a watch , but it' s really a laser .
keeps perfect time .
but for how long ?
at least your lifetime .
good to see you , mr bond .
things have been awfully dull round here .
bureaucrats running the place , things done by the book .
can' t make a decision unless the computer gives you the go ahead .
now you' re on this , i hope we' re going to have some gratuitous sex and violence .
i certainly hope so too .
what is this for ?
i' il show you .
you unscrew it , then stick it up your nose .
it' s for my sinus .
well , i won' t need one where i' m going .
where' s that , or are you not allowed to say ?
the bahamas .
lucky bloody you !
oh , sorry !
that' s perfectly all right .
what are you hoping to catch ?
something about 6' 2 " , 190lb ,
with brown eyes .
well , why bother going to sea ?
let me help you .
mr bond !
i say , mr bond !
catch you later , perhaps .
right .
nigel small fawcett , british embassy , nassau .
how do you do , nigel ?
sorry i' m late .
as you' re an undercover johnny , i took the precaution of not being followed .
that' s why you shouted my name across the harbour ?
oh , god , did l ?
oh , i' m sorry .
damn !
damn !
sorry .
i' m rather new to all this .
what' s the score with largo ?
he' s highly visible here .
enormously wealthy .
owns the biggest boat in the caribbean .
spends a lot of his time at a place called bluebeard reef .
marine archaeology , i gather .
you' ve met him ?
oh , yes .
he' s charming .
i mean ... foreign , but charming nonetheless .
he donates a lot of money to worthy causes .
he built a maritime museum
and a new wing for the orphanage .
i' m sure he' s very kind to his mother .
don' t know his mother .
you' re not going to make any trouble , are you ?
let' s face it , your reputation has preceded you .
do i look like i would make trouble ?
well , yes , frankly .
you' il jeopardise the tourist trade if you go around killing people .
nigel , please .
just go back to your desk .
find out where largo' s boat is at the moment .
call me later .
i' il be at my hotel .
jolly good .
i' il get onto that at once .
and take full advantage of the natural cover .
is this the flying saucer ?
yeah .
it sailed this morning .
oh !
how reckless of me !
i made you all wet .
yes , but my martini' s still dry .
my name' s james .
hello , james .
i' m fatima blush .
you ski very well .
i do many things very well .
i' m sure you do .
what brings you to nassau , james ?
i' m fishing .
for what ?
anything i can get .
i know the best waters .
i' d be very happy to show them to you .
why would you do that ?
i' d like you to find what you' re looking for .
i' m all yours .
yes ?
james , would you come down please ?
right away .
ah !
i think this should take care of you perfectly .
oh , i' m sure it will .
you' re marvellously well equipped .
thank you , james .
so are you .
thank you .
what exactly are we going down for ?
sport ... and a little fun .
you ... you appear tense .
you affect me , james .
well , that' s bad .
going down , one should always be relaxed .
is it far to the reef ?
it' s far enough .
we' ve got time to kill .
it' s you !
well , you did say you' d catch me later .
oh , my god !
623 and ...
728 .
728 .
here you are .
no messages .
hello ?
mr bond !
i' ve finally tracked you down !
small fawcett here .
i hope i haven' t caught you at an awkward moment .
no , not at all .
just be brief .
i don' t have too much time .
just want you to know that i' m on top of things .
i' ve found out that largo' s boat is en route for the south of france .
well done .
oh , it was nothing , really .
if you' re free tomorrow , why don' t we go snorkelling ?
sounds a wonderful idea .
oh , jolly good , bond !
because i was wanting to discuss with you ...
what' s that ?
mr bond ?
proof that we made the right decision .
about what , darling ?
your place or mine .
i found a villa for us just where you wanted .
it' s perfect !
the flying saucer is anchored in the bay below .
and q sent this .
thank you .
gotcha !
get down !
felix !
not bad .
not bad at all .
nothin ' wrong with your reflexes .
how you doin ' , buddy ?
what the hell are you doing here ?
cla sent me to ride shotgun with you .
326 .
how do you do ?
excuse my inexperience .
nicole .
i' m felix leiter .
enchant .
thank you .
my car is right there .
i ran some checks in the langley computer .
anything on largo ?
no , he' s squeaky clean .
i must say , for once your hunch was wrong , buddy .
ho ho !
algernon , right ?
yes .
i had the first one of those , and it blew up in my face .
a motorbike came for you from england .
here' s the papers .
what are you gonna do with it ?
i' il know when i test it .
it' s gonna be your ass , james .
thank you !
felix !
yeah ?
forget the soup .
feast your eyes on that .
what' ve you got here , james ?
that' s largo' s lady .
her name is domino .
domino petachi .
petachi .
the air force officer killed in that car crash .
jack petachi .
that' s right .
he was her brother .
well , there' s the man himself .
if he' s got the bombs , do you think he' d have them on his yacht ?
unlikely .
but get some scuba gear .
we' il check her out .
right .
hmm .
oui .
on a tout ce que vous voulez .
bon .
au revoir , madame .
merci .
welcome to the centre de la sant .
i hope you enjoy our facilities .
merci .
bonjour .
bonjour , monsieur .
do you serve men here ?
but of course .
some men more than others .
miss petachi !
no one told me you were here .
i am sorry .
you speak english , yes ?
yes .
quite well , in fact .
now ...
hard or soft massage ?
oh , hard , please .
well , perhaps we should begin with your back .
i ... don' t believe we' ve seen you around here before .
no , i was on a boat .
ah .
and what boat would that be ?
oh , the flying saucer .
oh !
mr largo' s boat .
yes .
do you know mr largo ?
oh , i know of him .
i know he owns many beautiful things .
yes , he' s a very generous man , mr largo .
i' m sure he is .
he' s giving a charity ball tonight at the casino , for children .
what a worthy cause .
mm .
perhaps i should attend .
i' d really like to ask you .
i would .
but i' m afraid the guest list is very restricted .
i' m sorry .
c' est la vie .
c' est la vie ?
such is life .
such is life .
mm , that feels so good !
it certainly does .
excuse me ?
it certainly does need it .
you have ... slight lesions in the upper vertebrae .
oh .
oh !
could you go a little lower , please ?
lower ?
yes , please .
please .
oh !
right there .
oh , that feels so good !
bonjour .
bonjour , monsieur .
i am sorry , mademoiselle .
we are so very busy today .
where' d the masseur go ?
who ?
the man , the masseur .
the man i pass ?
he does not work here .
they' il never let you in .
i' d better wait for you .
no , nicole .
go back to the villa .
find that villa !
oui , mademoiselle .
monsieur ?
wait a minute !
you there !
i shouldn' t have the fish .
you must have an unreasonable fear of gatecrashers to carry this heavy artillery .
this bomb has a tiny gyroscope inside .
any lateral movement on your part and you could be served in an egg cup .
if you understand what' s being explained to you , nod gently .
good boy .
stay .
hello again .
i do owe you an explanation .
my name is bond .
james bond .
may i offer you a drink ?
hard or soft ?
soft .
a double bloody mary with plenty of worcestershire sauce .
i hate to think what you mean by hard .
vodka on the rocks .
i think you have lost her .
do you imagine that i could lose a woman to an underpaid british agent ?
ja ?
ja .
and i warn you , if he' s not executed at once , he' il have your domino turned over .
is it possible that you have bungled your attempts because you want him ... for yourself ?
hm ?
maximillian , why torture yourself over that kind of woman ?
maybe one day you have to kill her , fatima .
your sense of humour is delicious .
what' s your brother up to these days ?
he' s on his way here .
oh , i can' t wait to see him .
how do you know my brother ?
hello !
you must be mr james bond , right ?
monsieur largo .
yes .
right .
are you a man who enjoys games ?
it depends with whom i' m playing .
ja .
shall we ?
join us .
these are my friends .
they honoured me by coming from all over the world to give money to my favourite charity .
and what might that be ?
orphan children .
so ... here we are .
the game is called domination .
i designed it myself .
but my problem is , i' ve never yet found a worthy adversary .
no doubt i shall disappoint you too .
we' il see .
darling ?
this game has one objective : power .
we will be fighting for countries , chosen at random by the machine .
but for this demonstration i will choose france .
target areas will light up on the map .
whoever hits them first with his laser beam will score points .
but there is another way to win .
with the left hand , you control two nuclear missiles .
with the right hand , you control a shield to block my missiles .
but if you fail ...
boom !
i win the game .
you will be red .
i will be blue .
are you ready ?
yes .
begin .
thank you , gentlemen .
eternal battle for the domination of the world begins .
we play for dollars .
spain .
value : $9, 000 .
play .
blue wins $9, 000 .
it gave me a shock .
oh , i' m sorry .
i forgot .
unlike armchair generals , we will share the pain of our soldiers , in the form of electric shocks .
one last point : if you let go of the controls , you forfeit the game .
as you were unaware of this , we will begin again .
reset .
thank you .
japan .
value : $16, 000 .
play .
excuse me .
excuse me .
blue wins $16, 000 .
a lucky move on my part .
perhaps i didn' t explain .
as the stakes increase , so does the level of pain .
rather like life .
we continue ?
of course .
good .
eternal battle for the domination of the world begins .
the united states .
value : $42, 000 .
play .
red pain level at 50 % .
danger level .
repeat .

65 % .
80 % .

danger .
danger .
domino .
excuse me .
are you all right ?
fine .
you lost $58, 000 .
it goes , of course , to my charity .
i think it' s better if we don' t continue .
can we play one more game for the rest of the world ?
win or lose ?
you know what that could mean ?
yes .
good .
best of luck .
you too .
final game .
remaining countries of the world .
value : $325, 000 .

excuse me .
it seems i underestimated you .
$267, 000 .
i' il settle for one dance with domino .
so ...
do you lose as gracefully as you win ?
i wouldn' t know .
i' ve never lost .
this game has been played , and i have lost .
that' s it .
he' s never gone this far before .
he' s certifiable .
a tango , yes ?
oui , monsieur .
what is it you' re after ?
in part , it' s about your brother .
what about my brother ?
did you know he was working for largo ?
that' s impossible .
jack is in the us air force .
that' s precisely why largo used him .
your brother' s dead .
keep dancing .
largo is the prime suspect .
your brother was used and eliminated .
they move well together , don' t they ?
today you have another chance .
this time you' d better not fail .
number 12 .
excellent .
you dance amazingly well , mr bond .
oh , it' s domino , really .
she' s such a pleasure to follow .
i know .
i' d love to have you for lunch .
if you are still around tomorrow , why don' t you join us on our boat ?
tomorrow' s not good for me .
why ?
i' m going to pick up jack .
that' s not possible .
jack phoned earlier to say he' d been delayed again .
at least for another week , maybe two .
bye bye .
thank you very much .
nicole ?
nicole !
don' t touch him !
he' s mine !
come on , come on !
ha !
quel homme imbcile !
hold it !
sit up .
your gun .
carefully !
over here .
spread your legs .
good .
very good .
you' re quite a man , mr james bond .
but i am a superior woman .
guess where you get the first one .
well , in view of your hatred of men ...
liar !
you know that making love to fatima was the greatest pleasure of your life .
well , to be perfectly honest ,
there was this girl in philadelphia ...
shut up !
i am the best .
yes .
yes , you' re right .
in fact ,
i was going to put you in my memoirs as number one .
all right .
write !
now write this ...
the greatest rapture in my life was afforded me in a boat in nassau by fatima blush .
signed , james bond , 007 .
i just remembered .
it' s against service policy
for agents to give out endorsements .
write !
right now ?
right now .
not perfected yet ? !
eh , vous , l bas , arrtez !
good show , james !
q actually came through , didn' t he ?
how long have you been here ?
long enough .
long enough for what ?
to see how you handled the lady .
come on !
this way !

hello !
good morning .
you are a bit early for lunch .
i know .
it' s rather embarrassing .

steward , get some clothes for my guest .
i' m overwhelmed .
i' m invited for lunch and given a cruise .
why ?
you had other plans ?
no , not at all .
i' m at your disposal .
of course .
cigarette ?
no , not today , thank you .
so ...
a drink ?
a vodka martini ?
of course .
this is my situation room .
from here , the world comes to me .
you could run a small government .
oh , no , i could run a large government .
what' s your latest venture ?
oil .
a new departure , besides which my other enterprises are of little consequence .
well , if it' s that big , let' s hope it doesn' t blow up in your face .
mr bond !
excuse me .
i have work to do .
time is money .
by the way , the staterooms are aft .
don' t forget ... 12 o' clock ...
iunch .
mr bond ...
enjoy the ship .
mr bond !
there' s fresh clothes in your cabin .
if you' d like to follow me ...
thank you .
what happened to my brother ?
why are you here ?
just trust me .
the tears of allah .
does that mean anything to you ?
this is it .
he gave it to me .
he said it was very valuable .
it doesn' t look it .
have you any idea where we' re heading ?
north africa .
he' s got a house , a place called palmyra .
somehow i' ve got to transmit a message out of here .
it could be risky , but i' m going to need your help .
what do you want me to do ?
i' m going to kiss you .
i want you to respond as if you liked it .
i' m doing this for two very good reasons .
one , because i' m hoping to provoke a reaction .
and the other one ?
because i always wanted to .
false alarm !
false alarm !
all crew return to stations .
we' ve had a message from one of our ships in the med .
i think it' s from bond .
about time .
he used emergency code tango zebra .
" heading north africa , palmyra .
palmyra ?
where is that ?
haven' t a clue , sir .
well , find out about it , will you ?
i' il do my best , sir .
north africa ?
quite impressive , huh ?
very .
that' s my retreat , where i can escape and enjoy all my treasures .
how do you like ... your new home , my princess ?
bond , the game is over .
take him away .
et doucement !
that belonged to napoleon' s empress .
that is my greatest treasure .
take it .
take it .
but be careful .
that is your ... wedding present .
you betrayed me .
but i forgive you .
and what about my brother ?
your brother ...
i hate you .
i hate you .
oh , domino !
domino !
you' re crazy .
ja , maybe ...
i' m crazy .
what a wonderful view .
you' il see .
every game has to have a winner .
so ...
ciao , bello !
largo .
bond .
in that case , where did you hide the bombs ?
you still think of escape ?
i must say , i admire your spirit .
well ...
bomb number one is right under the president' s feet ... in washington dc .
and number two ?
you were a very good secret agent .
really .
bye .
i' m sure this will amuse you .
goodbye , domino .
cover it up .
hold on !
whoa !
what are you doing ?
james !
you' re a hard man to keep up with !
clear the line to washington , felix .
that' s where the first bomb is .
it was never like this when i was in the navy .
here we are .
what' s the matter ?
you' re going back after largo , aren' t you ?
well , i have to .
i want him as much as you do .
probably more .
i can understand you hating him .
well , maybe ... maybe i don' t hate him enough to risk losing you .
but i don' t want to risk losing me , either .
commander bond , the washington bomb has been defused .
now , sir , from london , your chief wants to speak to you .
this is m. we' ve cracked the code for disarming the warheads , but we' ve only got five hours to find the second bomb .
now , as you perfectly well know , i have absolute confidence in you , and i ...
that' s what kept me going , sir .
all right , then , i' il be brief with you .
i know you' ve got your hands full .
if you should come through this fearful ordeal unscathed , i' d like to offer you lunch at my club .
over .
that' s a thrilling prospect , sir .
but if i do get through this ,
i may have other plans .
steady at 300 .
steady at 300 .
there she is , sir !
what' s she reading ?
seven fathoms , sir .
no way we can get in there .
the water' s too shallow .
nothing .
nothing moving on board .
awac surveillance reports no sightings on shore .
now why did largo anchor here ?
your pendant .
give it to me .
this is " the tears of allah " .
the story goes that the prophet wept and his tears made a well .
the contours are the same .
the diamond must mark a place .
that would be about here .
right where the oilfields begin !
sir , there is underwater activity in the area .
check the area for underwater caves .
sonar signals do indicate a cavity below sea level at 015 degrees .
there' s an underground river there .
commander pederson , are you equipped with the new xt 7bs ?
that' s top secret .
how do you know about them ?
from a russian translation of one of your service manuals .
sorry about that .
ports open .
fire one !
fire two !
cut track .
be careful of the housing .
watch it !
i' ve got to go in .
we don' t have much time .
give the sub our position and get some help .
kovacs ?
kovacs ?
come .
here , look .
well done , dr kovacs .
go ahead .
go ahead .
when the warhead is ready for its final voyage , we will drink a toast .
there is nothing that can stop us any more .
the guide rope !
keep the tension !
the tears of allah .
sweet , like money .
for years , it has been a monument to power , but nothing like what we now possess .
huh , kovacs ?
everybody stay undercover !
you , get up there !
leiter , stay down !
what took you so long ?
hold up on the heavy stuff .
bond is still in there !
it' s armed .
largo got away with the warhead .
call down a chopper .
i' m going to try the oasis .
good luck .
bond' s clear !
we' re movin ' in !
ah !
there you are .
i always have a martini at five .
you' il never give up your old habits , james .
no , you' re wrong .
those days are over .
ah !
oh , no .
i' m sorry , mr bond .
obviously caught you at a bad moment .
m sent you .
only to plead for your return , sir .
m says without you in the service he fears for the security of the civilised world .
never again .
never ?
# never , never say never again # never , never say never again
# you walk in a room # a woman can feel the heat # one look is a guarantee # nights could be long and sweet # the message is clear # like nothing i' ve ever known # but from all that i hear # forget about long range plans # cos this man' s got his own # to get mixed up with a man who says never
# may be big trouble , but then # i just could be the woman to take you # and make you never say never again # never , never say never again # never , never say never again # never , never say never again # never , never say never again # you' ve got all the moves # ah , but baby i got ' em too # no matter your attitude or your mood # i' il come through # the touch of your voice # the feel of your eyes on me # you leave me no choice # though i know there' s danger there # i don' t care , let it be # to get in bed with a man who says never
# may have no future , but then # i just could be the woman to reach you # and teach you to never say never again
# i' il bet you , i' il get you # i' il reach you , i' il teach you # i' il take you , i' il make you
