mutants .
since the discovery of their existence , they have been regarded with fear , suspicion , often hatred .
across the planet debate rages .
are mutants the next link in the evolutionary chain ?
or simply a new species of humanity , fighting for their share of the world ?
either way , it is an historical fact sharing the world has never been humanity' s defining attribute .
we are not enemies , but friends .
we must not be enemies .
though passion may have strained , it must not break the bonds of our affection .
lincoln said that in his first inaugural address as our nation' s 16th president .
it' s one of my favourites .
lf you' il please have your tickets ready , we can begin the tour .
jackie , clear my schedule .
i' m having dinner with my son .
yes , mr president .
excuse me , sir .
are you lost ?
perimeter breach at visitors ' checkpoint .
multiple subjects .
mr president , security breach .
jackie , leave .
get him to the car .
exits not clear .
unknown how many .
both sides secure .
something' s in the corridor .
to the shelter .
not clear .
it' s outside the oval office .
lock this place down .
don' t shoot !
my god .
neanderthals .
we once believed that they were wiped out by years of conflict with the much more advanced branch of humanity called cro magnon man , but recent research into our dna suggests that these two species may have interbred , evolving into modern humans .
ln other words , into what ?
us .
that' s right .
artie .
not here .
come on .
pay attention .
.. makes me insane when she does this ...
what are you looking at ?
sick ...
to the shelter .
they' re gonna kill him .
jean ?
you ok ?
yeah , i' m fine .
it' s just a headache .
it' s notjust a headache , is it ?
i wasn' t sure how to say this , but since liberty lsland you' ve been ...
scott .
you' ve been different .
my telepathy' s been off lately .
i can' t focus .
i hear everything .
jean , it' s notjust your telepathy .
a month ago you had to concentrate just to levitate a book .
now when you have a nightmare the entire bedroom shakes .
my dreams are getting worse .
i keep feeling something terrible' s about to happen .
i would never let anything happen to you .
have you guys seen bobby and rogue ?
something' s happening in the food court .
it' s a simple question .
why are you being a dick ?
yeah , why are you being such a dick ?
because i can .
can i have a light ?
sorry .
can' t help you out , pal .
john , knock it off .
why don' t you stop showing off ?
for her ?
i can' t help it if your girl' s getting excited .
she isn' t .
we' re trying to have a good time .
you' re the only one having a good time .
that' s real cute , man .
what are you gonna do ?
suddenly you' re not so tough .
bobby , what did you do ?
i didn' t do this .
no .
i did .
and the next time you feel like showing off , don' t .
breaking news .
we' re live from washington , where there' s been an attack in the oval office of the white house .
we have been informed that the president and vice president were not harmed .
sources say the attack involved one or more mutants ...
i think it' s time to leave , professor .
i think you' re right .
ln my opinion , magneto' s behind this .
i don' t think so , scott .
while eric could organise something like this from prison , it would be irrational and only hurt his goal of mutant prosperity .
you mean superiority .
you' re right , if eric had his way .
and , of course , the government will reintroduce the registration act .
or worse .
the president could declare a state of emergency , place every mutant under arrest .
do you think the assassin worked alone ?
we' il only know that if we find him first .
i' ve been trying to track him using cerebro , but his movements are inexplicably erratic .
when i have exact coordinates , storm , jean , i' il need you to take the jet and pick him up .
it was close , wasn' t it ?
closer than anyone' s admitted .
what do you need , william ?
your authorisation for a special operation .
no , thank you , mr president .
i thought you were here to talk about school reform .
funny you should say that , mr president .
senator .
mr president .
thank you for having me .
senator kelly , colonel william stryker .
how do you do ?
his department has been dealing with the mutant phenomenon since before my time .
you were a staunch supporter of the registration act , but it seems your ideas on the mutant problem have changed .
for the best , i hope .
so what are you proposing , mr stryker ?
may i , mr president ?
we' ve managed to gather evidence of a mutant training facility in the salem region of upstate new york .
where did you get this information ?
lnterrogation of one of the mutant terrorists from the liberty lsland incident .
eric lehnsherr ?
you have access to him ?
magneto , yes .
we developed the technology that built his plastic prison .
this facility is a school .
sure it is .
what the hell is that ?
ajet .
what kind ofjet ?
we don' t know .
but it comes up out of the basketball court .
lf we' d been allowed to do ourjobs before this incident ...
all right , listen .
william , you enter , you detain , you question , but the last thing we need to see is the body of a mutant kid on the six o' clock news .
mr stryker ?
senator kelly .
this is yuriko , my personal assistant .
quite a handshake .
what can i do for you ?
eric lehnsherr' s prison .
i' d like to arrange a visit .
it isn' t a petting zoo , senator .
ln this conflict he is the enemy , you' re just a spectator , so why not sit this one out ?
conflict ?
mr stryker , do you really want to turn this into some kind of war ?
i was piloting black ops missions in north vietnam while you were sucking on your mama' s tit at woodstock .
don' t lecture me about war .
this already is a war .
you' re dead .
you' re so dead .
you' re dead .
i don' t wanna hurt you .
i' m not afraid .
logan .
you miss me , kid ?
not really .
how are you doing ?
i' m ok .
how are you ?
who' s this ?
this is bobby .
he' s my ...
i' m her boyfriend .
call me lce man .
right .
boyfriend ?
so how do you guys ... ?
we' re still working on that .
look who' s come back .
just in time .
for what ?
we need a baby sitter .
baby sitter ?
nice to see you again , logan .
hi , logan .
hi , jean .
i should go and get the jet ready .
well , it was good to meet you .
come on , let' s go .
bye , logan .
i' il see you later .
storm and i are heading to boston .
we won' t be gone long .
the professor wants us to find a mutant who attacked the president .
so it was a mutant .
you' il be here when we get back , unless you plan on running off again .
i could probably think of a few reasons to stick around .
find what you were looking for , logan ?
more or less .
i' il see you boys later .
be safe , ok ?
you too .
bye .
see ya .
aren' t you gonna welcome me home ?
your bike needs gas .
then fill her up .
mr laurio , how long can we keep this up ?
how long is your sentence ?
forever .
not necessarily forever , mr lehnsherr .
just until i' ve got all that i need .
mr stryker , how kind of you to visit .
have you come back to ensure the taxpayers ' dollars are keeping me comfortable ?
done .
you can go .
now ...
mr lehnsherr .
i' d like to have one final talk about the house that xavier built and the machine called cerebro .
my tolerance for your smoking in the mansion notwithstanding , smoke that in here and you' il spend the rest of your days under the belief you are a six year old girl .
can you do that ?
i' d have jean braid your hair .
welcome back .
you want me to leave ?
no .
just don' t move .
these lights represent every living person on the planet .
the white lights are humans .
and these are the mutants .
through cerebro i' m connected to them , and they to me .
you see , logan ?
we' re not as alone as you think .
i found the base at alkali lake .
there was nothing there .
the broken line represents the path of the mutant who attacked the president .
i' ve been finding it difficult to get a lock on it .
can' t you just concentrate harder ?
lf i wanted to kill him , yes .
there .
looks like he' s finally stopped running .
i need you to read my mind again .
the results will be the same as before .
we had a deal .
the mind is not a box that can be simply unlocked .
it' s a beehive with a million ...
spare me the lecture .
i' ve no doubt your amnesia , your adamantium skeleton , the claws are all connected , but ...
logan , sometimes the mind needs to discover things for itself .
i promise you we' il talk again when i return .
lf you would be kind enough to watch over the children tonight .
scott and i are going to visit an old friend .
i' m sending the coordinates of where the mutant' s settled .
as soon as you find him , bring him back to the mansion .
let' s hope he cooperates .
yes , for his sake .
good luck .
stryker , william .
what are you doing in here ?
garbage .
these are the coordinates .
he' s a teleporter .
must be why the professor had trouble locating him .
we' re not here to hurt you .
we just wanna talk .
are you bored yet ?
oh , yeah .
sure you don' t wanna come down ?
you have him ?
he' s not going anywhere .
are you ?
please don' t kill me .
i didn' t mean to harm anyone .
why would people have gotten that impression ?
what' s your name ?
wagner .
kurt wagner .
there was so much shooting , such fear .
and then there was only pain .
i could see it all happening , but i couldn' t stop myself .
it was like a bad dream .
perhaps he is testing me .
and before you were in the white house , what do you remember ?
nothing .
i was here .
i' d rather get him back to the professor .
the professor ?
did you do these yourself ?
and what about this ?
i need you to read my mind again .
the results will be the same as before .
you' il be indestructible .
no memory .
sometimes the mind needs to discover things for itself .
wolverine .
no memory .
you' il have no memory .
can' t sleep ?
how can you tell ?
cos you' re awake .
right .
how about you ?
i don' t sleep .
doesn' t anybody sleep around here ?
apparently not .
got any beer ?
this is a school .
so that' s a no ?
yeah , that' s a no .
ls there anything other than chocolate milk ?
there' s soda in that cupboard .
thanks .
no problem .
i' il take him from here .
it' s all right , scott .
nice shades .
thanks .
charles xavier .
have you come to rescue me ?
sorry , eric , not today .
to what do i owe the pleasure ?
the assassination attempt .
what do you know about it ?
nothing .
only what i read in the papers .
you really shouldn' t have to ask .
what' s happened to you ?
i' ve had frequent visits from william stryker .
you remember him , don' t you ?
his son , jason , was once a student of yours , wasn' t he ?
yes .
years ago .
unfortunately , i wasn' t able to help him .
at least , not in the way his father wanted .
and now you think taking in wolverine will make up for your failure with stryker' s son ?
how long you been here ?
a couple of years .
and your parents just sent you off to mutant school ?
actually , my parents think this is a prep school .
i see .
well , i suppose lots of prep schools have their own dorms , campuses ...
jets .
so you and rogue .
it' s not what you think .
i' d like it to be , but it' s just ...
it' s just that it' s not easy when you wanna be closer to someone , but you can' t .
i' ve seen how you look at dr grey .
excuse me ?
nothin ' .
logan' s mind is still fragile .
ls it ?
or are you afraid of losing one of your precious x men , old friend ?
eric , what have you done ?
i' m sorry , charles .
i couldn' t help it .
what have you told stryker ?
everything .
the war has begun .
scott !
you should have killed me when you had the chance .
but now and then every mother needs to get away .
without her , the babies are helpless ...
hi .
what is it ?
you picked the wrong house .
you all right ?
stay here .
this way .
let' s go .
john !
where' s rogue ?
i don' t know .
i gotta find her .
open it .
here , take her .
go on , get in .
let' s go .
come on .
take him .
he' s stunned .
i can help you .
help them .
rogue !
bobby !
this way .
come on .
everybody , follow me up here .
move .
come on .
let' s go .
come on , this way .
this is it .
logan .
you wanna shoot me , shoot me .
don' t shoot him .
not yet .
wolverine ?
i must admit this is certainly the last place i' d expect to find you .
how long has it been ?
15 years ?
you haven' t changed one bit .
me , on the other hand ...
nature .
wait .
we' ve gotta do something .
they' il kill him .
he can handle himself .
let' s go .
bobby .
please .
i didn' t realise xavier was taking in animals , even animals as unique as you .
who are you ?
don' t you remember ?
no !
logan , come on .
let' s go .
go .
i' il be fine .
but we won' t .
go .
keep going .
right , get in .
i' m driving .
maybe next time .
this is cyclops' s car .
oh , yeah ?
what the hell was that back there ?
stryker .
his name is stryker .
who is he ?
i can' t remember .
here .
this is yours .
i hate uncomfortable silences .
what are you doing ?
i don' t think that' s his cd player .
sit back .
where are we going ?
storm and jean are in boston .
we' il head that way .
my parents live in boston .
good .
sergeant ?
most of the mutants escaped through a series of tunnels .
we have some in custody .
how many ?
six , sir .
welcome , professor .
take what we need , gentlemen .
this protest underscores a growing concern among most americans .
mutant registration ...
why stop there ?
it' d be easier to round up mutants by the truckload .
or maybe you' d like an all out war ?
oh , please .
turn that shit off , lou .
a lot on your mind ?
mr laurio ?
i' m grace .
you want another beer ?
of course you do .
you' re really aggressive .
yes , i am .
i' ve never hooked up with a girl like you before .
i know .
it' s kind of dirty in here , don' t you think ?
that' s the idea .
velcro ?
nice .
bottoms up .
i certainly hope so .
bottoms up .
william ...
please , xavier , don' t get up .
i call it the neural inhibitor .
it keeps you outta here .
what have you done with scott ?
don' t worry .
i' m just giving him a little re education .
of course , you know all about that , don' t you ?
you wanted me to cure your son , but mutation is not a disease .
you' re lying .
you were more frightened of him than i was .
just one year after jason returned from your school , my wife ...
you see , he resented us .
he blamed us for his condition , so he would toy with our minds , projecting visions and scenarios into our brains .
my wife , in the end , she took a power drill to her left temple in an attempt to bore the images out .
my boy the great illusionist .
for someone who hates mutants , you certainly keep some strange company .
they serve their purpose , as long as they can be controlled .
you arranged the attack on the president .
you didn' t even have to read my mind .
i' ve been working with mutants as long as you have , xavier , but the most frustrating thing i' ve learned is nobody really knows how many even exist or how to find them .
except you .
unfortunately , this little potion won' t work on you , will it ?
you' re much too powerful for that .
lnstead , we' il go right to the source .
allow me to introduce mutant 14 .
the fluid secreted by his brain acts as a mind controlling agent .
but that' s only where it begins .
jason ?
my god , william .
this is your son .
what have you done to him ?
no , charles .
my son is dead .
just like the rest of you .
mom ?
dad ?
ronny ? ls anybody home ?
i' il try and find you some clothes .
don' t burn anything .
i found some of my mom' s old clothes .
i think they' re from before i was born .
groovy .
hello ?
jean .
where are you ?
these are my grandmother' s .
thanks .
you won' t hurt me .
wow .
i' m sorry .
it' s ok .
ronny , next time you ...
who the hell are you ?
aren' t you supposed to be at school ?
bobby , who is this guy ?
this is professor logan .
there' s something i need to tell you .
you' re clear .
have a nice sleep , lehnsherr ?
there' s something different about you .
yeah .
i was having a good day .
it' s not that .
sit down .
sit your ass down .
what could it be ?
what are you doin ' ?
there it is .
too much iron in your blood .
mr laurio , never trust a beautiful woman , especially one who' s interested in you .
when did you first know you were a ...
a mutant ?
would you cut that out ?
you have to understand .
we thought bobby was going to a school for the gifted .
bobby is gifted .
we know .
we just didn' t realise ...
we still love you , bobby .
it' s just this mutant problem is a little ...
what mutant problem ?
.. complicated .
what exactly are you a professor of ?
art .
you should see what bobby can do .
i can do a lot more than that .
this is all my fault .
actually , it' s males that carry the mutant gene and pass it on , so it' s his fault .
911 .
please state your emergency .
i need the police .
there are people in our house .
they won' t let us leave .
it' s believed a manhunt for several fugitives from the facility is now under way .
nobody' s responding .
i can' t get a signal .
why don' t you take a break ?
i' il keep trying .
what are they ?
they' re angelic symbols passed on to mankind by the archangel gabriel .
they' re beautiful .
how many do you have ?
one for every sin .
so quite a few .
you and miss grey are schoolteachers ?
yes .
at a school for people like us , where we can be safe .
safe from what ?
everyone else .
outside of the circus most people were afraid of me .
but i didn' t hate them .
i pitied them .
do you know why ?
most people will never know anything beyond what they see with their own eyes .
i gave up on pity a long time ago .
someone so beautiful should not be so angry .
sometimes anger can help you survive .
so can faith .
storm , i found an active com device .
where ?
oh , god .
it' s for me .
have you tried not being a mutant ?
no one' s left , jean .
soldiers came .
what about the children ?
i saw them escape .
not sure about the rest .
we can' t reach the professor or scott either .
where are you ?
boston , with bobby drake' s family .
ok .
we' re on our way .
and , storm , make it fast .
we have to go now .
why ?
logan , what' s wrong ?
drop the knives and put your hands in the air .
what' s going on here ?
ronny .
i said drop the knives .
open the door .
break it .
turn around .
up against the wall .
this is just a misunderstanding .
put the knives down .
i can' t .
look .
the rest of you , on the ground now .
kid , i said on the ground .
we don' t wanna hurt you , kid .
you know all those dangerous mutants you hear about on the news ?
i' m the worst one .
get down .
who the hell is this ?
kurt wagner .
ln the circus i was known as " the lncredible nightcrawler " .
save it .
storm .
we' re outta here .
jason , stop it .
