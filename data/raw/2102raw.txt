you ever think about dying ?
yeah .
you ?
yeah .
some .
you think there' s a heaven ?
yeah .
don' t you ?
i don' t know .
yeah , maybe .
can you believe there' s a heaven if you don' t believe in hell ?
i guess you can believe what you want to .
this ranch has been in my family as long as anyone can remember .
my granddaddy used to tell me this was heaven on earth .
just like his granddaddy used to tell him .
everything' s changed now since he died .
appreciate you lighting them candles .
it wasn' t me .
it was the lady .
my mother ?
she was here ?
she' s left already ?
all i ever wanted was to live out there like him ... ... and work my own spread .
can' t imagine no better life .
i' ve come to find out mama aims to sell it .
says the oil company would pay three times what it' s worth .
mama lives in san antonio now with her new husband .
she wants to be in the live theatre .
as your granddaddy' s only child ... ... your mother inherits outright .
it' s her property .
she can do whatever she wants .
i don' t have any say so ?
what about my father ?
they' re divorced .
you could talk to her .
you' re a lawyer .
well , i have talked to her .
it' s a sorry piece of business , but , son ... ... not everybody thinks life on a cattle ranch in texas ... ... is the second best thing to going to heaven .
she don' t want to live out there , that' s all .
if it was a paying proposition , that' d be one thing , but it ain' t .
it could be .
i could run it .
it' s his own damn fault .
your father signed every paper she set in front of him .
never lifted a hand to save himself .
i begged him to get a lawyer .
well ....
i' m sorry to have no better news ... ... but some things in this world can' t be helped .
i believe this is probably one of them .
she went back to san antonio .
don' t call her " she .
mama .
i thought the world of that old man .
yeah .
don' t go crying on me now .
i ain' t .
well , don' t .
i ain' t .
what do you think i should do ?
i don' t think there' s much to do .
will you talk to her ?
i can' t .
you could talk to her .
last conversation i had with her ... ... was in san diego , california , in 1 942 .
it ain' t her fault .
i ain' t the same as i once was .
like to think i am ... ... but i ain' t .
you are inside .
inside you are .
it' s hard to watch people you came from waste away before your eyes .
when the land is gone too ... ... there' s nothing to stand on or stand for either .
when do y' all have to be out ?
closing is the first of june .
you could wait till then .
what for ?
down in mexico ... ... they got ranches so big ... ... you can' t ride from one end to the other in a week .
it ain' t all fenced in and sold off and played out .
not down there .
you think they can' t use two more top hands ?
real cowboys , huh ?
just like the old time waddies .
if i don' t go , will you go anyways ?
i' m already gone .
thank you for everything .
goodbye .
may god go with you .
be careful .
is that you , bud ?
i hope so .
you ready ?
yeah .

there' s don hector rocha y villareal .
owns this whole shebang .
one of the last great ranches in mexico .
27, 000 acres .
flies his own plane to mexico city every week .
manuel said this ranch been in this family 1 70 years .
you reckon that was his daughter ?
yeah , i guess it was .
let me go get my boots on .
looks like there' s about 1 2 or 1 3 of them .
i make it 1 6 .
armando said the old man' s got like 400 mustangs up on that mesa .
damn .
you think you and me can break all 1 6 of them in four days ?
why four days ?
you think we could do it ?
you' d be about a wore out sumbuck , i' il tell you that .
i' il have a look at them .
go talk to armando .
how you doing ?
i' m all right .
if we mess this up , bud , it' s gonna be a long ride back to texas .

hector de la rocha y villareal .
john grady cole .
glad to meet you .
alfonsa , you look like an lmpressionist painting .
armando says you know a lot about horses .
i' ve been around them some .
do you know what a criollo is ?
yes , sir .
it' s a argentine horse .
you' re from texas ?
yes , sir .
san angelo .
why are you here ?
i just wanted to see the country , i reckon .
or we did .
you and your friend .
yes , sir .
but you are the leader .
we don' t have no leaders .
no , we' re just buddies .
of course .
i recently purchased a thoroughbred stallion of excellent blood .
you gonna raise racehorses ?
no .
quarter horses .
i' m thinking of breeding my stallion with my mesteno mares .
what' s your opinion on that ?
well , i' ve known it done .
there' s been good cow horses sired out of thoroughbreds .
of what importance is the mare ?
same as the sire .
in my opinion .
most breeders place more confidence in the stallion .
yes , sir , they do .
but i agree with you .
and you rode all the way here from texas ?
yes , sir .
you and your friend ?
yes , sir .
just the two of you .
yes , sir .
just me and him .
well , mr. cole , would you like to see some horses ?
yes , sir .
it ain' t like you was going away .
no .
we' d still be working together .
it' s a good opportunity for you .
hell , i' d do it .
they told me to come bunk in here .
i was going to put my horse in one of these stalls .
can i put my horse in this stall ?
well , i guess we can talk later .
that' s your mare .
look at the eye on her .
bring this one here .
she' s not as big as the other one , but that' s your mare .
do you like this one ?
she' s a beauty .
looks like some of them got their hats on , bud .
i figure you just must be ready to cry yourself to sleep every night .
she' s probably used to dating guys got their own airplanes , let alone cars .
you' re probably right .
i' m glad to hear you say it .
it don' t change nothing though .
my name' s john grady cole .
my name is alejandra .
i know .
i hoped that you would come .
i come because i thought you' d be here .
i know .
my granddaddy lived his whole life on that ranch .
seventy four years .
seem there could hardly be one without the other .
i guess ... ... the country lasts forever , and people ain' t but for a while .
and how will you live now ?
where will your home be ?
what' s wrong ?
i dreamed about you last night .
what did you dream about ?
someday i may tell you .
but not tonight .
do i have something in my nose ?
no .
i have something in my nose .
do you like him ?
a hell of a horse .
i want to ride him .
what ?
i want to ride him .
when ?
now .
i want to now .
he don' t have a saddle .
i know .
i don' t think the patrn would want me to give him to you without a saddle .
your father .
get down .
are you sure about this ?
yes !
hurry .
well , what do you aim to do with your horse ?
i want you to take him back to the barn .
somebody' s gonna see me .
fixing to get me in trouble .
you are in trouble .
i am senorita alfonsa .
i' m john grady cole .
i' m happy that you have come .
alejandra will be in mexico city with her mother for two weeks .
then she' il be here for the summer .
alejandra and i disagree strongly .
in fact , i ....
she' s so much like me at that age that l
i seem , at times , to be struggling with my own past self .
so you see , i cannot help but be sympathetic to alejandra .
but i won' t have her unhappy .
i won' t have her spoken ill of ... ... or gossiped about .
i know what that is .
it is not proper for you to be seen riding in campo together ... ... without supervision .
i considered whether to speak to my niece about it , but i ....
i' ve decided not .
what do you want me to do ?
i want you to be considerate of a young girl' s reputation .
i never meant not to be .
i believe you .
but you see ... ... this is another country .
here , a woman' s reputation is all she has .
there' s no forgiveness ... ... for women .
a man may lose his honour and regain it again , but a woman cannot .
i guess i' d have to say that don' t seem right .
it' s not a matter of right .
it' s a matter of who must say .
and in this matter , i get to say .
what is it ?
you' re going to wake esteban .
then invite me in .
what did she say to you ?
my aunt ?
you want to sit down ?
go on .
what did she say to you ?
didn' t she tell you what she said ?
of course she did .
what did she say ?
she said she didn' t want me being seen with you in the campo .
and you agreed ?
you are afraid of her .
no .
just like everyone else .
it ain' t like that .
i hate the way she treats me .
i thought you were my friend .
you tell me what you want me to do .
i' il do anything you say .
how' s it going , esteban ?
see you after a while .
i know the old man likes you ... ... that don' t mean he' il sit for you courting his daughter .
yeah , i know .
well , i don' t see you holding no aces , bud .
i see you fixing to get us fired and throwed off this place .
take it easy , bud .
get up !
what' s this all about ?
no talking !
yes , but i don' t understand
you understand " shut up " ?
let' s go .
i ain' t above whipping your ass , you know .
don' t you think if we' re gonna get out of this ... ... we might think about how to get out of it together ?
like the way we got in it ?
you think it was rocha ?
you think he sold us down the river ?
i tried to reason with you .
tried many times .
i know .
some things ain' t reasonable .
look , i' m the same man you crossed that river with .
how i was is how i am .
and all i know to do is stick .
i don' t believe in signing on just till it quit suiting you .
you either stick or you quit .
i wouldn' t quit you .
i don' t care what you done .
that' s about all i got to say .
i never quit you .
all right .
hey , y' all .
oh , god help me .
how long you been in here ?
i don' t know .
a long time .
at least a month .
you told them to hunt us ?
i wouldn' t do nothing like it .
bullshit .
they wouldn' t hunt us if they got that horse back .
he done something .
it was my horse .
my gun too .
what did you do ?
nothing nobody else wouldn' t .
did you come back here ?
you' re damn right i did .
oh , jesus , oh , god .
what did you do ?
what are they accusing him of ?
murder .
he killed a man ?
three .
said he killed three men .
that' s a damn lie .
don' t step in the bucket .
we' re dead .
we' re dead men .
i knew it' d come to this from the first moment
don' t start .
that won' t help .
ain' t but one of them died .
tell me what happened .
well , i got me a job on this farm .
saved me up some money .
then i rode back here to get my pistol .
i seen it sticking in the son of a bitch' s belt , so i just grabbed it .
and shot him .
he come at me .
what choice did i have ?
what choice ?
by the time i got back to the spring where my horse was ... ... they caught back up with me .
and the old boy , i shot off his horse .
he throwed down on me with a shotgun .
a rurales ?
did you shoot a rurales ?
yeah .
dead ?
yeah .
what do you think they mean to do ?
send me to the penitentiary .
you ain' t gonna be that lucky .
well , i' m too young to hang .
they' il lie about your age .
there' s no capital punishment here .
you knew they' d hunt us .
was i supposed to send a telegram ?
what happened to your feet ?
they busted them .
they didn' t give you no bandages ?
no .
oh , shit .
tell them whatever they want to hear .
it won' t matter .
what did you say ?
told them we was murderers and horse thieves .
you will too .
your friend told us everything .
better that you do the same to avoid some trouble .
you had no right to beat up on that boy .
we know nothing about blevins .
he asked to ride with us .
we know nothing about the horse .
it got away from him in the storm and showed up here .
that' s when the trouble started .
we been working for senor rocha going on three months down at la purisima .
you went down there and told him lies .
rawlins is as good a boy as ever come out of tom green county .
is that the criminal , smith ?
his name is rawlins .
he ain' t a criminal .
i grew up with him .
the assassin blevins , he did not have any documents .
he lost his clothes .
he lost his clothes ?
he has no feathers .
he what ?
he has no feathers .
i wouldn' t know anything about that .
that don' t interest me .
why does he come here and steal horses ?
it was his horse .
no , it' s not .
you have it your own ignorant way .
as far as i know , that horse is his .
he had it in texas and i saw him bring it to mexico across a river .
that is not the facts .
we can make the truth here .
or we can lose it here .
but in three days , you' re going to be going to saltillo .
then it' il be too late for the truth .
too late .
because you' il be in the hands of other peoples ... ... and who' s to say what the truth will be then ?
and then you' il think about this day ... ... and you' il blame yourself .
there ain' t but one truth .
truth is not what come out of somebody' s mouth .
the people in this town are very quiet people .
very quiet people all the time .
and then comes this assassin blevins ... ... and he kills everybody and steals their horses .
why does he do this ?
was he a good , quiet boy that never did no harm ?
then he comes here and does something like that ? ls that what happened ?
no .
no , that' s not what happened .
that' s not the truth .
truth is he was always the other kind of boy .
he was never a quiet boy .
he was always the other kind .
what happened ?
nothing .
i think we' re going to saltillo .
what' s in saltillo ?
the penitentiary .
i think he wants to make a deal with us .
what kind of a deal ?
to keep quiet .
that kind of a deal .
keep quiet about what ?
about blevins .
about what about blevins ?
i think they aim to kill him .
i think they aim to kill blevins .
boys ... ... this is going to be a long trip .
the old man said it would take all day .
i asked him .
he said it was going to take all day .
what' s here ?
unload the prisoners , boys .
what do we do here ?
take a leak , i reckon .
unload the prisoners .
put them against the wall .
sit them down .
let' s go .
what are they going to do ?
wait a minute !
wait a minute !
let go of me .
wait a minute .
wait a minute .
let go of me .
this man came to me .
i don' t go to this man .
he came to me to talk with me about justice ... ... and how his own brother had died at the hands of the assassin blevins .
then when it came time to do justice ... ... he could not shoot .
he was like a woman .
a man cannot go out to do something ... ... and then not do it .
no , a man does not change his mind .
that' s always been my way in this world .
you didn' t have to kill him .
could' ve just walked him back to the truck .
you don' t know nothing .
see , in my country , we don' t have death for criminals .
monies have to be paid ... ... and arrangements have to be made .
i tell you this because ... ... you' il have to make arrangements with these peoples .
we don' t have no money .
in here we have a boss , a jefe .
everybody pays him .
everybody does what he says .
i don' t have any money .
we ain' t fixing to make any arrangements .
oh , excuse me , but you will .
i' m telling you this because i like you .
you cannot stay here .
you stay here , you' re gonna die .
and then comes other problems .
the paperwork is lost .
people cannot be found .
who' s to say you were even here ?
some crazy people can say that god is here .
but god is not here .
everybody knows that god is not here .
i never dreamed there was such a place as this .
there' s probably every kind of place you can think of .
they' re gonna kill us .
don' t let them think they ain' t gonna have to .
they either kill us or let us be .
only way to get by in a place like this is go about your business .
don' t act scared .
where are you going ?
i don' t know , bud .
got a match ?
what is it ?
a knife .
a good one .
what' s it like to be dead ?
it ain' t like nothing at all .
what' s it like to be dead ?
it ain' t like nothing at all .
yes , sir , you' re a good healer .
fast .
you been doing any doctoring on a boy named lacey rawlins ?
send you some soap , some towels ... ... so you can wash up .
you don' t know a lacey rawlins ?
you are fortunate boys .
fortunate boys .
where' s rawlins ?
he wait outside for you .

yes , now .
where are we going ?
you' re going away .
you' re going to your house .

i thought you' d died .
i thought you had .
why ain' t we dead ?
she paid us out .
the old senora ?
the aunt .
why ?
i don' t know .
it' s got to do with that girl .
i expect it does .
you going back down there ?
yeah , i guess i am .
on account of the girl .
but what about the horses ?
the girl and the horses .
what about rocha ?
he' il have to do whatever he has to do .
don' t go down there .
i ain' t asking you to go with me .
i know .
they put mexican blood in me in that hospital .
so ?
so , what does that mean ?
about what ?
well , does that mean i' m part mexican ?
how much they put in you ?
they said it was over a litre .
a liter would make you a half breed .
it don' t , does it ?
no .
no , it don' t mean nothing .
it' s just blood .
it don' t know where it come from .
you heard about what happened , didn' t you ?
in the mess hall ?
yeah .
i never thought i' d do that .
you didn' t have no choice .
he' d have done it to you .
you don' t got to try to make it right .
it is what it is .
shit .
what ?
nothing .
just shit .
what is it ?
i keep thinking about old blevins .
about how scared he was .
you' il feel better when you get home .
i don' t think so .
i ain' t blevins .
i know you ain' t .
i was wondering how much better off you are than him .
i reckon i' il see you one of these days .
you take care .
you take care too .
i think i' m owed an explanation .
i think the accounts have been settled quite in your favour .
you have been a disappointment to my nephew ... ... and a considerable expense to me .
no offense , ma' am , but i' ve been some inconvenienced myself .
sit down , please .
the officers were here once before , you know .
my nephew sent them away until he conducted his own investigation .
he wanted so much to go on believing in you .
why didn' t he say something to me ?
he gave his word to the commandante .
he should' ve let me tell my side of it .
you had already lied to him once .
why shouldn' t he assume you' d do so again ?
i never lied to him .
the affair of the stolen horse was known here even before you arrived .
the thieves were americans .
when he questioned you about this , you denied everything .
why' d you buy me out of jail ?
i think you know why .
because of alejandra .
yes .
what did she give in return ?
i think you know that also .
that she won' t see me again .
yes .
you didn' t have the right .
you should' ve left me there .
you would' ve died .
then i' d have died .
we' re willing that you should have a horse .
i' il trust esteban to supervise the selection .
do you have enough money ?
do you have enough money ?
i aim to see her .
am i supposed to be surprised ?
i' il even give you my permission .
although that doesn' t seem to be a thing you have ever required .
her telephone number .
in the end , mr. cole ... ... we all get cured of our sentiments .
those whom life doesn' t cure ... ... death will .
she will not break her word to me .
you will see .
yes , ma' am .
we will .
i knew it would be you .
i have to see you .
i can' t .
you have to .
i' m coming .
no , you can' t .
i won' t be here .
i go to la purisima in two days .
i' il meet you at the train .
no , my father will have men there .
alejandra , i love you .
i love you .
you didn' t have no right to make that promise , even if they killed me .
i ain' t gonna leave until i see you .
even if it' s the last time , i don' t care .
even if they kill me now .
i will leave a day early .
tomorrow morning .
i' il say that my aunt is ill .
meet me in zacatecas .
i will be there .
my god , you' re beautiful .
it' s all my fault .
no .
you couldn' t have saved us .
you couldn' t have saved blevins .
i told my father we were lovers .
why ?
because she threatened me .
my aunt .
she said i must stop seeing you or she' d tell him .
i couldn' t stand for her to have that power .
she left me no choice .
i told him myself .
i love you so much , i thought i could make him understand .
i was so foolish .
it was her arrogance .
i told her i would not be blackmailed .
she made me crazy .
but i broke my father' s heart .
i broke his heart .
i put you in danger , and you almost died .
he had armando lock me into my room so that i couldn' t warn you .
the next morning , he flew me back to the city .
i thought i would never , never see you again .
don' t cry .
don' t cry .
don' t cry .
i destroyed everything .
i' m going to make it right .
you can' t .
well , i will make it right .
somehow , i will .
you don' t understand .
what don' t i understand ?
i didn' t know that my father could stop loving me .
i didn' t know he could .
now i know .
what are you doing ?
i saw you dead in a dream .
just like the dream i had the night before we danced together .
it was dawn .
men in serapes stood over you .
and you were dying .
all because of your whore .
don' t say that .
i want you to marry me and come to texas .
when i found out you were in prison i made a promise .
i know .
for my life .
yes .
i love you .
i' il love you till the day i die .
i believe you .
i swear to god .
i believe you .
no .
i cannot do what you ask .
i love you very much .
but i cannot .
i have no honour except my promise .
if i lose that too ... ... then what am l ?
shut the door .
what do you want ?
i come for my horse .
rawlins ' and blevins ' horses too .
i don' t have your horses .
you by god know where they' re at .
you make trouble for yourself .
i got trouble you never even heard of .

if you follow us , i' il kill them .

goodbye , get out of here !
if you come back , i' il kill the captain .
you' re going to die .
yeah , you can just keep talking .
when i die , you die .
why don' t you let me go ?
because you' re my hostage .
stay close , or i swear to god , i' il shoot you .
go on .
i' il shoot you .
have to come back to my town ?
i told you .
for my horse .
my head is sick .
i can' t ride no more .
you' d be surprised at what you can do .
you' re going to die .
you' re going to die .
we' il let god decide about that .
you' re not afraid of god ?
i' m not afraid of god .
i got no reason to be afraid .
i even got a bone or two to pick with him .
where are the keys ?
where are the keys !
goddamn you !
die , you son of a bitch !
give me your goddamn hand .
i' m not going to kill you .
i' m not like you .

how is your wound ?
you doing okay ?
thank you .
thank you .

go with god , my son .
howdy .
howdy .
how you doing ?
could you tell me what day it is ?
it' s thursday .
i mean the date .
it' s thanksgiving .
do either of you want to buy a rifle ?
no .
i' m not interested .
so i come back across and was riding on the road ... ... and i run into this man , and he told me i had to come see a judge .
there' s a problem with the horses .
your honour ... ... the fact of the matter is this boy ain' t got a lick of proof .
three different horses and different brands on them .
deputy smith , you know what the trouble with a liar is ?
trouble with a liar is , he can' t remember what he said .
i know that' s right .
i ain' t a liar .
i know that , son .
i know that .
i can' t believe anybody would make up a story like the one you just told .
can i ask you a personal question ?
yes , sir .
you mind showing the court them bullet holes in your leg ?
oh , all right .
that' s where it come out .
that' s fine , son .
thank you .
you didn' t have no medical attention ?
no , sir .
wasn' t none to be had .
deputy smith ?
your honour ?
i want you to see that this boy gets his horses back .
son , you' re free to go .
thank you .
the court thanks you for your testimony .
in all the years i' ve sat on this bench ... ... l heard lots of things that give me grave doubts about the human race .
this ain' t one of them .
all right .
you can go , boy .
thank you .
thank you .
i don' t like to bother you .
but they told me this is where you live .
that' s all right .
they were right .
come on in .
thank you .
pleased to have you .
when i was in the penitentiary ... ... l killed somebody .
i' m sorry to hear that .
he come at me with a knife .
so ....
i just happened to get the best of him .
but that keeps bothering me somehow .
something else , ain' t there ?
yes , sir .
but later , i wanted to kill that other one too .
that mexican captain .
why do you suppose that is ?
because i sat there , and he walked the boy out to the trees and shot him .
i didn' t say nothing .
i didn' t say a word .
would it have done any good ?
no , sir .
that don' t make it right .
and it never will .
bothered me that you might think that i' m something special .
i ain' t .
you know what you strike me as ?
one of them people that has a tendency ... ... to be a little tough on themselves .
there' s nothing wrong with you , son .
you' il get it sorted out .
i hope so .
if i live .
you' il live , all right .
lacey once asked me if i thought god looks out for people .
i guess he does .
i say he' s just about got to .
i don' t believe we' d make it a day otherwise .
i thought you might want your old horse back .
damn , bud .
