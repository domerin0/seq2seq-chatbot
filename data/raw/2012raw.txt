strange beautiful grass of green ... with your majestic silver seas .
your mysterious mountains i wish to see closer .
may i land my kinky machine .
the first time i ever saw a movie at the cinematheque franaise ...
i thought only the french ... would house a cinema inside a palace .
the movie was sam fuller' s ' shock corridor ' .
lts images were so powerful , it was like being hypnotised .
i was 20 years old .
it was the late 60s .
i' d come to paris for a year to study french .
here i got my real education .
i became a member of what was kind of a freemasonry .
the freemasonry of cinephiles .
what we' d call ' film buffs ' .
i was one of the insatiables ... the ones you' d always find sitting closest to the screen .
why do we sit so close ?
maybe it was because we wanted to receive the images first , when they were still new , still fresh , before they cleared the hurdles of the rows behind us .
before they had been relayed back from row to row , spectatorto spectator , until , worn out , second hand , the size of a postage stamp , it returned to the projectionist' s cabin .
doctor , i' m not nuts , i' m here forthe paper !
maybe , too , the screen really was a screen .
it screened us from the world .
but there was one evening , in the spring of 1968 , when the world finally burst through the screen .
obeying an obscure coalition of dubious interests , the minister malraux has driven ...
henri langlois out of french cinematheque .
chaillot offered us all a free and fair conception ... of film culture .
now , for bureaucratic reasons , culture' s arch enemies ... have seized this bastion of liberty .
resist them !
liberty isn' t given !
it' s taken !
all those who love film ...
ln france .
and abroad .
are with you .
and with henry langlois !
henri langlois created the cinematheque .
because he liked to show movies ... instead of letting them rot in some underground vault .
he' d show any movies , good , bad , old , new ... silents , westerns , thrillers .
all the new wave filmmakers came here to learn their craft .
this is where modern cinema was born .
what lies behind it : the police !
langlois had been sacked by the government .
every film buff in paris had turned out in protest .
it was our very own cultural revolution .
excuse me ...
can you remove this ?
it' s stuck to my lips .
what ?
can you remove my cigarette ?
it' s stuck .
yes , yes ...
of course .
sorry .
what are you ?
english ?
no , i' m american .
you can put it out now .
what' s your name ?
matthew .
you' re here a lot .
but you nevertalk to anyone .
why are you always alone ?
i don' t really know anybody .
why are you chained to the gates ?
i' m not chained to the gates .
you' re awfully clean .
for someone who likes the cinema so much .
do you know jacques ?
lf shit could shit , it would smell like jacques .
my brother' s gone to talk to him .
when he gets back , you' il smell jacques on him .
it' s like being around pigs .
you speak english really well .
what ?
you speak english really well .
my mother' s english .
here' s theo .
when i introduce you , just ...
give him a sniff .
come on .
truffaut , godard , chabrol , rivette , and renoir , jean rouch , rohmer are here .
signoret , jean marais and god knows who else .
marcel carne too .
why is carne here ?
what should we do ?
stay or leave ?
i don' t know .
theo .
this is matthew .
you were right , he' s american .
hi .
i' ve seen you around .
you' ve been coming to all the nicholas ray' s .
yeah , i really like his movies .
what ?
' they live by night ' ?
more like ...
' johnny guitar ' and ' rebel without a cause ' .
you know what godard wrote about him ?
no , what ?
' nicholas ray is cinema . '
what' s up with you ?
me ?
stay with me !
quick !
bastards !
fascists !
bastards !
assholes !
and that was how i first met theo and lsabelle .
i could hear my heart pounding .
i don' t know if it was because i' d just been chased by the police , or because i was already in love with my new friends .
as we walked and talked , about politics , about movies , and why the french could never produce good rock bands ...
i' m starving .
i forgot the sandwiches .
i didn' t want that night everto end .
thank you .
didn' t you bring anything ?
no , i' m okay .
please , eat .
don' t mind me .
no , i' m really not hungry .
i' ve broken it now .
take it .
you' re very kind , but ...
take it when you' re offered it !
thank you .
theo .
don' t you have something for matthew ?
this is fine .
i gave him a third of mine .
i didn' t come here to eat your sandwiches .
he doesn' t want it .
yes , he does .
he' s just too polite to say he does .
you' re both very kind .
where are you from exactly ?
san diego .
what about you two ?
were you both born in paris ?
i entered this world on the champs elysees .
1959 .
on the pavement .
you know what my first words were ?
no , what ?
' new york herald tribune . '
new york herald tribune .
' new york herald tribune . '
new york herald tribune .
will you come to rome with me ?
here , right here .

no , there !
goodnight , matthew .
goodnight .
i was born ... in a trunk ... in the prince' s theatre ... in pocatella ...
ldaho .
i was born ... in a trunk ... in the ...
prince' s theatre ...
i' ve got some real news this time .
i' ve just met my first french friends .
hello ?
matthew ?
who is this ?
don' t be suspicious .
it' s me .
theo ?
did i wake you up ?
i' ve been up for ages .
you don' t sound like that .
i always sound like this in the morning .
i had to call early , i' ve a class at nine .
you want to have dinner tomorrow night with lsa and me ?
a real dinner in a nice restaurant ?
no , not in a restaurant .
here .
at home .
yeah , sure , that' d be great .
yes ?
okay .
theo , get off the phone .
it' s 09 : 00 .
meet us for a drink first .
at the respite .
six o' clock .
you know where it is ?
boulevard saint germain ?
be there at six .
third floor !
third floor ?
there' s room in here for all of us .
theo and i are contagious !
we' re very contagious .
contagious ?
you shouldn' t catch us !
it' s beautiful .
you think so ?
good luck .
evening , maman .
what are you doing here ?
we' re here for dinner .
what ?
with matthew .
didn' t lsabelle say ?
which matthew ?
this matthew .
he' s our new friend .
matthew , this is my mother .
very pleased to meet you .
likewise .
you' re american , are you ?
yeah , i' m from california .
matthew lives in a nasty student hotel .
rue malebranche .
so we invited him to dinner .
what' s wrong ?
what can i say ?
i' m cooking fortwo and now there are five of us .
didn' t theo tell you ?
no , he didn' t .
and neither did you .
have you got mashed potatoes for brains or what ?
you were supposed to tell her !
you' re crazy !
bitch , cow , slut ...
put a sock in it , you two !
i must apologise for my children' s behaviour .
no , i' m the one who should be apologising .
please don' t put yourself out on account of me .
very sweet of you , seeing as you' re completely blameless .
let me look at you .
i want you to make a good impression on papa .
dad , it' s me .
we' re eating in .
and the cinematheque ?
closed until further notice .
can' t you see we have a guest ?
this is matthew .
sir .
matthew .
matthew' s dining with us tonight .
my young matthew .
lnspiration is like a baby .
it does not choose a nice , seemly hourto enterthe world .
it has no consideration forthe poor poet .
but when it does come , when it deigns to come , then you know it' s ...
young man ...
i was speaking to you .
i imagined you were listening .
i was .
i' m sorry .
what ?
nothing , i was just ...
you seem to be mesmerised ... by this tin lighter .
i' d like to know why .
well ?
george , matthew' s our guest .
i' m genuinely curious .
i' d like to know why .
i was fidgeting with lsabelle' s lighter .
i wasn' t really realising it , and then i noticed and i thought it was rude , so i put it down on the table .
but i put it diagonally across one of these squares .
do you see ?
look , i' il show you .
that' s when i noticed that the lighter' s length ... is exactly the same length as the diagonal itself .
so i put it lengthwise ... along the outside edge .
look , it ... it fits there too .
but it fits there .
and it fits like this and like this .
and this way too .
and i bet you if i just split it in half ... you know it' s gonna fit somewhere .
it really fits anywhere .
see ?
i was noticing that the more you look at everything ... this table , the objects on it , the refrigerator , this room ... your nose , the world ...
suddenly ... you realise that ... there' s some sort of cosmic harmony ... of shapes and sizes .
i was just wondering why .
i don' t know why that is .
i know that it is .
you have an interesting friend here .
more interesting , i suspect , than you know .
i mean , when we look around us , what is it we see ?
chaos , isn' t it ?
complete chaos .
yet , viewed from above , as it were , by god , everything suddenly fits together .
my children believe that their demonstrations and sit ins , and happenings ...
they believe that these possess the capacity ... not only to provoke society , but also to transform it .
what is it you are saying ?
lf langlois is dismissed , we shouldn' t do anything ?
lf immigrants are deported , if students are beaten up , we shouldn' t do anything ?
what i' m saying is that a little lucidity would not go amiss .
so , everyone' s wrong but you ?
ln france , in ltaly , germany , america ...
before you can change the world , you must realise you yourself are part of it .
you can' t stand outside looking in .
you' re the one who stands outside .
you' re the one who refused to sign a petition against the vietnam war .
poets don' t sign petitions .
they sign poems .
a petition is a poem .
yes .
and a poem is a petition .
thank you , theo , but i' m not gaga yet .
i don' t need you to remind me of my own work .
that' s right .
a petition is a poem and a poem is a petition .
those are the most famous lines you ever wrote .
and now look at you .
i hope i' il never become like him .
theo .
we should say goodnight .
we' ve got a long day tomorrow .
george ?
yes , sorry .
you were saying ?
we should get to bed .
you had something to tell the children .
yes , of course .
i' m sorry .
the cheques are on the mantelpiece .
don' t cash them until you need them .
good night , everybody .
good night , papa .
have a safe journey .
good night , dear .
theo ?
a very good night to you .
it was a pleasure meeting you , sir .
good night .
good night .
very nice meeting you .
thank you so much for dinner .
it' s my pleasure .
lnvite matthew to spend the night .
i don' t like the sound of hotel malebranche .
good night .
why haven' t you dazzled us with your philosophical speculations ?
i didn' t know i was philosophical .
papa was awfully impressed .
papa' s full of shit .
i think you' re lucky .
i wish my parents were that nice .
other people' s parents are always nicerthan our own .
and yet , our own grandparents are always nicerthan other people' s .
that' s true , that' s absolutely true .
i neverthought about it before .
but it' s true .
matthew , you' re sweet .
this is double the length of ...
i' m for bed .
are you staying ?
are you okay ?
yeah , i' m okay .
goodnight , matthew .
everybody' s got a father .
yes .
but the fact that god doesn' t exist , doesn' t mean he can take his place .
okay ?
yeah , it' s fine .
goodnight .
goodnight .
see you in the morning .
see you .
thank ...
thank you .
i need a man to love me .
oh , don' t you understand me , babe ?
i need a man to love .
i want me , someone to hold me when i ... call out for it .
someone to be around me so i ... won' t be afraid of it .
' cos it ...
can' t be now .
can' t be now .
can' t be now .
can' t be now .
can' t be just loneliness .
what the hell is wrong with me ?
no , no , no , it just can' t be ...
good morning .
what was that all about ?
i was removing the sleep from your eyes .
theo lets me do his every morning .
it' s a strange thing to want to do .
didn' t you enjoy it ?
was i supposed to ?
naturally .
up , up , up !
what are you waiting for ?
lsabelle , i' m not dressed .
what are you doing ?
what are you doing ?
' i' ve been memorising this room . '
' ln the future , in my memory ,
i shall live a great deal in this room . '
' queen christina ' , where greta garbo bids farewell to the room ... in which she spent the night with john gilbert .
bravo !
the bathroom' s at the end of the corridor .
be there in one minute , or we' re coming back to get you .
come in .
hello .
good morning .
are you going to church ?
oh , sorry .
you want to use my toothbrush ?
no .
sure ?
i' il use my finger .
sleep well ?
yeah .
i mean , fine .
yeah ?
you know , matthew ... you really do have the most beautiful pair of lips .
can i touch them ?
you wanna touch my lips ?
okay .
they' re so red and ripe ... and luscious .
so sullen ... brutal .
let' s see what you look like with lipstick .
i really should be going .
you' d make such a pretty girl .
lgnore her , matthew .
she sucks in all the air around her .
no , i really have to ... be getting back to my hotel .
no , why ?
we were going to invite you to stay .
really ?
sure .
our parents have left .
they' re going to be in trouville for a month .
you might like to move yourthings here .
really ?
sure .
but you barely even know me .
this way we get to know you .
you don' t have to stay in a hotel , do you ?
we' il go and pick up what you need with my mobylette .
come on .
but ...
what about you ?
it was my idea .
jesus !
i' m going to check out the cinematheque .
don' t take too long .
don' t worry , i won' t .
i don' t have much stuff .
with us , you' re not going to need much .
don' t forget yourtoothbrush !
okay .
i guess you' re surprised to be hearing from me so soon .
but i' ve just moved into an apartment ... belonging to a famous french author ... whose children are the same age as me and have the same interests .
i' m getting in with the right kind of people .
say hello to father .
i hope he' s not still mad at me .
listen to this , matthew .
the difference between keaton and chaplin ... is the difference between prose and poetry , between the aristocrat and the tramp , between eccentricity and mysticism , between man as machine , and man as angel .
not bad , huh ?
that' s good .
except for me , there' s no comparison .
why ?
because chaplin' s incomparable ?
no .
because keaton is incomparable .
you think keaton' s greaterthan chaplin ?
absolutely i do .
you' re not serious .
course i am .
you' re crazy .
you can' t deny that keaton' s funnierthan chaplin .
i can .
you don' t think that keaton is funnierthan chaplin ?
nobody is funnierthan chaplin .
keaton is .
even when he' s not doing anything .
and he looks like godard .
keaton is a real filmmaker .
chaplin , all he cares about is his own performance ...
his own ego !
that is bullshit .
it' s not bullshit !
yes , it is .
you americans understand fuck all about your own culture .
no wonder you' ve never got the point ofjerry lewis .
don' t even get me started on jerry lewis !
when chaplin wanted to have a beautiful shot , he knew how .
betterthan keaton , betterthan anybody .
you rememberthe last shot of ' city lights ' ?
he looks at the flower girl , she looks at him , and don' t forget she' d been blind , so she was seeing him ... forthe very first time .
and it' s as if , through her eyes , we also see him forthe very first time .
charlot , the most famous man in the world .
as if we' ve never seen him before .
lsa , if you play that fucking record again ,
i' il break it in two , okay ?
but you like janis joplin .
stop it !
i said stop it , lsabelle !
stop !
stop !
matthew , tell me , what film ?
what ?
name a film ... where someone tap dancing drives someone else crazy .
forfeit to pay if you can' t answer .
you' il pay the forfeit !
' top hat ' !
fred astaire is dancing over ginger rogers ' room .
and she' s mad because he wakes her up .
i' m right .
he' s good .
you thinking what i' m thinking ?
what ?
' bande a part ' .
you' re right .
why are you two looking at me like that ?
well ... you see , my little matthew ...
there' s something theo and i have been meaning to do for a long time , but we' ve been waiting forthe right person to do it with .
and i think you' re finally it !
to do what ?
try to beat the record of ' bande a part ' .
what record ?
you' ve seen ' bande a part ' .
the scene where the three of them race through the louvre .
they try to beat the world record of 9 minutes 45 seconds .
of course !
we' re going to beat their record .
what ?
what' s the matter ?
nothing really .
not afraid , are you ?
no , i' m not afraid .
what then ?
it' s easy for you two .
i' m an american , an alien .
lf i get caught , i get deported .
we' re not going to get caught .
you don' t know that .
they weren' t caught in ' bande a part ' , we won' t be caught either .
it' s a movie !
go get papa' s stopwatch .
it' s a great idea , but ...
it' s not ...
this is a test .
are you going to pass it or fail it ?
be careful .
a lot depends on how you answer .
9 minutes and 28 seconds .
we beat the record by 1 7 seconds !
we did it !
matthew , my little matthew .
you were wonderful !
' we accept him .
one of us . '
' we accept him .
one of us . '
we accept him .
one of us .
we accept him , we accept him .
gooble gooble , gooble gooble .
' we accept him .
one of us . '
one of us .
when your mother , sends back all your invitations .
and your father ... to your sister ... he explains ... that you' re tired of yourself ... and all of your creations ,
won' t you come see me ...
queen jane ?
won' t you come see me ...
we accept you .
one of us , one of us !
now all of the flower ladies want back what they have lent you .
that' s maman .
i' m too wet to answer .
lsa' s smart but she doesn' t know how to deal with parents .
what do you mean ?
i mean , it' s not enough to ignore them , they should all be arrested , put on trial , confess their crimes , sent to the country for self criticism and re education !
they' re already in the country .
they are at the seaside .
that' s different .
hello ?
hello ?
too bad .
my parents never go anywhere .
you have the house to yourselves .
where are you going ?
i gotta get out of these clothes .

let' s have a drink .
i' il meet you downstairs .
matthew .
yes ?
yes .
why don' t you admit you were thrilled ?
what ?
weren' t you just a bit excited ?
what' re you trying to get me to say ?
nothing .
i asked you a question .
you know who you sound like ?
lsabelle .
why not ?
she' s my twin sister .
you two are twins ?
yes .
she' d be me if she were a man .
you' re not identical .
yes , we are .
we' re siamese twins .

you' re a strange one , theo .
half an hour ago ... you looked at her as though you wanted to strangle her .
i did .
i don' t understand you .
do you have brothers or sisters ?
two older sisters .
didn' t you ever want to strangle them ?
course i did , but i never masturbated in front of them , and ... they never forced me to do anything i never wanted to do .
do you think lsabelle forced me ?
deep down , i knew things couldn' t go on as before .
now the stakes had been raised .
for a while , there was a kind of truce between theo and lsabelle .
and then one evening ...
theo !

or pay the forfeit .

the film ?
' scarface . ' howard hawks .

as you know , lsabelle , i' m not a sadist .
i just want to see everyone happy , no one left out .
so , i' d like you ... and matthew ... to make love in front of me .
but not in here , i don' t fancy sleeping in someone else' s spunk .
no offence , matthew .

theo and me ?
it was love at first sight .
but he' s never been inside you ?
he' s always inside me .
what would you do ...

and now you' ve made me feel like i' m a part of you .
both of you .
let' s get something straight , okay ?
you' re a nice boy and i like you a lot .
but , no ... it wasn' t always meant to be the three of us .
i told you something else , remember ?

get off my back .
i can' t explain now .
arsehole !
theo , wait for me !
a little souvenir from nepal .
thanks , that' s sweet .
call me .
okay , with pleasure .
see you .
we hardly left the apartment any more .
we didn' t know or care if it was day or night .
we were drifting out to sea , leaving the world far behind us .
too strong for you .
no , it was really good .
good ?
yeah .
again ?
no .
clapton is god , matthew .
i don' t believe in god .
but if i did , he would be a black left handed guitarist .
this is not chaplin and keaton .
this is clapton and hendrix .
clapton reinvented the electric guitar .
clapton reinvented the guitar !
matthew , believe me .
clapton plugs in a guitar ...
okay , jimi hendrix is different ...
he plugs in an electric guitar and he plays it like an acoustic guitar .
hendrix plugs in an electric guitar , he plays with his teeth !
there are soldiers in the vietnam war right now .
who are they listening to ?
clapton ?
no .
they' re listening to hendrix .
the guy who tells the truth .
it' s all fucked up !
you' re talking about soldiers in vietnam ?
yes .
what are they doing in vietnam ?
they' re at war .
what are they doing ?
they' re fighting .
they are killing peasants .
they' re dying , too !
they' re killing children , they' re burning fields !
they wanna be there .
they wanna die and they wanna kill people .
shouldn' t you be in vietnam ?
shouldn' t you be in vietnam ?
i don' t believe in violence .
where are you now ?
shouldn' t you be in vietnam ?
i' m lucky , i' m in a university .
i have friends who aren' t in university ... and they' re expendable .
you' re not lucky .
i am fucking lucky .
' no , i' m against violence .
i don' t agree with your war . '
maybe in france .
ln america you have to go .
lf you don' t go , you go to jail .
i preferto go in jail , instead of killing people .
you don' t understand .
i read it in ' cahiers de cinema ' .
a filmmaker is like a peeping tom , a voyeur .
it' s as if the camera is ... the keyhole to your parents ' bedroom .
and you spy on them , and you' re disgusting .
and you feel guilty , but you can' t ...
look away .
it makes films like crimes and ... directors like criminals .
like it should be illegal .
there goes my chance to be a filmmaker .
my parents always left the bedroom door open .
you' il have to direct theatre , not cinema .
maybe .
up .
come on !
my parents only fucked once in their life .
that' s why we' re twins .
they didn' t want to make it twice .
hey joe !
where are you going with that gun in your hand ?
hey joe !
where are you going with that gun in your hand ?
and hey joe !
where are you going with that gun in your hand ?
i' m going down to shoot my old lady .
you know i found her messing around with another man .
i' m going down to shoot my old lady .
you know i found her messing around town .
don' t be alarmed , matthew .
it' s good news .
it only happens once a month .
i love you , lsabelle .
i love you too , matthew .
yeah , but i really love you .
and i really , really love you too .
we both do .
oh , yeah .
that' s not what i wanted you to say .
what do you want us to say ?
i wanted you to say you love me .
we just did .
no , you said you love me too .
i don' t want you to say that you love me too .
i want you to say that you love me .
we love you , we love you .
that' s not right either .
you have to say it first .
we can' t , you already said it first .
why am i always the first to say it ?
poor matthew .
we do love you very much .
i don' t want to be loved very much .
i want to be loved .
you know when someone wants it , there' s no such thing as love .
there are only proofs of love .
are you ready to give us a proof of your love ?
you want proof of my love ?
okay .
get out of the bath .
shaving cream .
razor .
thanks .
what are you doing ?
what do you think i' m doing ?
you' re not serious ?
yes , i am .
don' t worry .
it' s an operation i' ve performed before .
relax , it grows back .
you' re both fucking crazy !
what' s the matter ?
this is what you call proof of love ?
turning me into a freak ?
' one of us . '
it' s just a game .
' one of us . '
it' s just a game !
a game , lsabelle ?
a game ?
think about it .
ls this something you do to each other ?
you want me to be a little boy for you ?
a little pre pubescent theo at six who you can play games with ?
and you could touch peepee .
i' il show you mine , you show me yours !
just calm down .
we hear you .
theo , think about it .
think .
you sleep in the same bed together every night .
you bathe together , you pee in the john together .
you play these little games .
i wish you could step out of yourselves and just look .
why are you so cruel ?
because i love you .
a strange way of showing it .
i really love you .
both of you .
and i admire you .
and i look at you and i listen to you and i think ... you' re never gonna grow .
you won' t grow like this .
you won' t .
not as long as you keep clinging to each otherthe way that you do .
have you ever been out on a date ?
a date ?
yeah , a date .
what kind of date ?
have you ever been out with a boy ?
with theo .
not theo .
have you ever been out with a boy , that you met at school ?
i was nevertaken to a school prom .
we don' t have proms in france .
you have dates in france .
have you ever been out with a boy ?
why do you keep asking me that ?
you know i haven' t .
would you like to ?
ls this an invitation ?
it' s an invitation .
would you like to go out on a date with me ?
just the two of us .
don' t look at theo .
you don' t need his permission .
we can' t sit in the front row , we have to sit at the back .
the front is for people who don' t have dates .
sorry .
excuse me .
on a date , you always sit at the back .
ladies and gentlemen ... the motion picture you are about to see is a story of music .
i play the role of tom miller , an agent .
a small time theatrical agent who had been a ...
well , you' il see .
this picture was photographed in the grandeur of cinemascope .
pardon me .
sorry i can' t stay , but i have a train on tap .
all the best , georgie .
you can' t stand to hear me sing again , huh ?
you know it isn' t that .
you' il never know .
no , i know i won' t be fooled .
when i' m being true .
but if you guess it ,
i' il confess it .
oh , darling , i would like to know .
or perhaps you' il never ...
no , no , you' il never ...
oh , no , you' il never ... ever know .
you' il never know .
when i looked at the tv screen ,
i remembered the battle of the cinematheque .
except this time the demonstrators weren' t film buffs .
they weren' t even just students any longer .
it was hard to figure out what was happening , but ... shops had closed their doors , factories had gone on strike ... and it was beginning to spread all over paris .
we' re willing to consider all legitimate demands .
theo and i never watch television .
we' re purest .
pure and hard .
let' s go .
yeah , but ...
jesus !
what' s wrong ?
they' re not mine .
no , your room .
no .
ln all the time i' ve been here , i haven' t seen your room .
you do have a room of your own ?
of course i have .
don' t think i always live in theo' s pigsty .
how come we never go in there ?
no one' s making love on my bed .
it' s your room , it' s part of you , i wanna see it .
just tonight .
no , no , and no .
i discovered a side of lsabelle i' d never seen before .
a secret side she hadn' t wanted me to see .
i suddenly thought of my sisters ' bedrooms in san diego .
i thought of our house and our neighbours ' houses , all alike , with their green lawns and their sprinklers , and their station wagons parked outside .
that you' re dreaming of .
i know the word ... that you long to hear .
i know your deepest secret fear .
i' m a spy ...
in the house of love .
i know the dream ...
that you' re dreaming of .
what sculpture ?
i always wanted to make love to the venus de milo .
i can' t stop you .
i' ve got no arms .
i can' t stop you .
what' s wrong ?
what' s wrong ?
don' t .
don' t .
don' t .
don' t listen to it .
don' t cry , don' t cry .
please , leave me alone .
leave me alone , please .
please !
go away !
lsabelle !
lsabelle !
theo , open up !
theo !
lsabelle !
you' re gonna hurt yourself !
who are you ?
what are you talking about ?
what are you doing in my room ?
get out !
get out !
theo !
theo !
theo !
theo !
theo !
theo .
a revolution isn' t a gala dinner .
it cannot be created like a book , a drawing or a tapestry .
it cannot unfold with such elegance , tranquility and delicacy , or with such sweetness , affability , courtesy , restraint and generosity .
a revolution is an uprising , a violent act ... by which one class overthrows another .
chateau lafite , 1955 .
chateau chasse spleen , 1959 .
grand vin , 1937 .
happy birthday , papa !
again ?
listen , matthew .
yes ?
you' re a big movie buff , right ?
yes .
then think of mao as a great director ... making a movie with a cast of millions .
all those millions of red guards marching together into the future ... with the little red book in their hands .
books , not guns .
culture , not violence .
can' t you see what a beautiful epic movie that would make ?
i guess , but ...
it' s easy to say books not guns .
but it' s not true .
it' s not ' books ' .
it' s ' book ' , a book .
just one book .
shut up .
you sound just like my father .
no , listen to me .
the red guards that you admire , they all carry the same book , they all sing the same songs , they all parrot the same slogans .
ln this big epic movie , everybody is an extra .
that gives me the creeps .
i' m sorry to say it , but ... for me there is a distinct contradiction .
why ?
because ... if you really believed what you were saying , you' d be out there .
where ?
out there on the street .
i don' t know what you mean .
yes , you do .
there' s something going on out there .
something that feels like it could be really important .
something that feels like things could change .
even i get that .
but you' re not out there .
you' re inside with me , drinking expensive wine , talking about film .
talking about maoism .
why ?
that' s enough .
no , tell me why .
ask yourself why .
i don' t think you believe it .
i think you buy the lamp , you put up the posters , but it ain' t ...
i don' t think you ...
look , you speak too much .
okay .
theo , just listen to me .
i think you prefer ...
i think you prefer when ... when the word ' together ' means not ... a million , but just two .
boys , boys !
orthree .
lsa , come and join us .
no , thank you .
it stinks of whores here .
thanks a lot .
i' ve got a surprise for you in the salon .
i' m getting right in !
it' s beautiful .
come on , get in .
we did this when we were little .
more wine ?
thank you .
lsabelle .
god , your breath is foul .
oh , i' m sorry .
you' re drunk .
yeah , i am drunk .
and you are beautiful .
and tomorrow morning , i' il be sober , but you' il still be beautiful .
go to sleep , matthew .
yes .
ls it time to sleep ?
ldiot , you can hardly keep your eyes open .
night night .
theo .
theo .
wake up .
what is it ?
i want you to listen .
why ?
because ...
i love you .
you know that ?
i love you too .
you love me too ?
that' s funny .
are you listening ?
it' s for ever , right ?
what' s for ever ?
the two of us .
right ?
why did matthew say that ?
what did matthew say ?
that we' re monsters , freaks .
i just want you to tell me that it' s for ever .
it' s for ever .
lsa ...
you don' t understand .
we' il talk about it in the morning .
i promise .
good .
we must leave now , darling .
already ?
would you like to have dinner with them ?
we must leave on tiptoe .
lsa !
what' s happening ?
the street came flying into the room !
what ?
the street came flying into the room !
what' s that smell ?
it' s tear gas .
ln the streets !
ln the streets !
go !
go on !
ln the streets !
ln the streets !
ln the streets !
ln the streets !
matthew !
lsabelle !
lsabelle !
ln the streets !
ln the streets !
ln the streets !
this is just the start , the fight goes on !
i light it up and throw it on the right .
theo , this is wrong .
this is wonderful .
this is violence !
it' s not violence .
it' s wonderful .
this is fucking fascism in a fucking bottle !
i' m no fascist !
the cops are fascists !
and then police hit people .
shut up !
you do not understand !
this is wrong .
listen to me .
this is what they do .
this is not what we do .
we use this .
we do this .
we use this !
stop it !
lsabelle . lsabelle .
lsab ... !
death to the cops !
fascists !
this is just the start , the fight goes on !
this is just the start , the fight goes on !
