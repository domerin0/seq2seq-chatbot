alex , mum' s in a coma !
mr. kerner , we don' t know yet , whether or not your mother will ever wake up again .
can you hear me , mum ?
you' ve got to wake up !
but mother was fast asleep .
in her deep , neverending sleep ... she circled like a satellite around the events happening ... on our little planet in our even smaller republic .
the 9th convention agreed to honecker' s request , to relieve him of his duties ... because of health problems and thanked him for his political life' s work .
congratulations !
her sleep obscured the retirement of the esteemed comrade erich honecker ,

mother kept on sleeping .
deeply and firmly .
she missed my first trip into the west , and how some comrades conscientiously protected us workers and peasants . and how some comrades conscientiously protected us workers and peasants .
of course she also missed my first cultural discoveries in a new country .
excuse me , excuse me .
excuse me , excuse me .
mothers deep sleep didn' t allow her to participate in the first free polling .
helmut !
helmut !
helmut !
she missed how ariane gave up her study of economic theory ...
enjoy your meal and thank you for choosing burger king . ... and made her first practical experience with the circulation of money .
the sleep saved her the moving in of ariane' s new boyfriend .
rainer , class enemy and barbecue man .
the furniture from the bedroom is going to the basement .
the furniture from the bedroom is going to the basement .
she missed the increasing westernization of our 79 square metre apartment ...
the old rubbish with the red dot is going to the bulk waste , okay ?
the old rubbish with the red dot is going to the bulk waste , okay ?
... and rainer' s enthusiasm for the oriental customs and way of life .
the big hormanal ecstasy that i experienced watching a few beautiful legs , didn' t reach into her night .
shit !
what' re you doing there ?
i ... the infusion ...
and not even the first day of nurse lara exchange angel from the sovjet union , penetrated her black dreams .
there you are again .
hello .
i was worried about you .
they' ve put me in clink .
mother overslept the triumph of the capitalism .
relief !
and the coordination of my hospital visits .
do you know what i noticed ?
when she' s in a good mood , she' s carrying her hair loosely .
when she' s in a bad mood , she puts them up .
and during the doctor' s round , she chews on her fingernails .
don' t you think she' s got a beautiful smile ?
her sleep ignored , how heroes of work became unemployed .
her sleep ignored , how heroes of work became unemployed .
the pgh tv workshop " adolf hennecke " was winded up .
i was the last one and i switched off the light .

satellite dishes blossomed in our landscape .

doctor wagner said we should talk to you .
and if i can' t be there in person , i thought it might work like this too .
it' s 5 o ' clock now .
most of the doctors are gone and you' ve finally got some peace .
nurse lara , who' s washed you , should be gone too .
if you could see her you' d surely wake up .
ariane sends you her regards , she thinks the idea with the tape is nonsense .
well , you know her .
she' s just in the room taking care of paula who' s getting her teeths and is screaming all the time .
mother overslept my unstoppable progress with lara .
our first romantic rendez vous followed 4 early shifts and 35 late shifts .
it' s loud here !
our russian teacher came from minsk and weighed a ton .
and that' s all you know about russian women ?
the wind of change blew into the ruins of our republic .
summer came and berlin was the most beautiful place on earth .
we felt like being in the center of the world .
where finally something moved .
and we moved with it .
it' s too bad she doesn' t realize any of this .
well , maybe it' s better that way .
everything she believed in has dissolved into air in a few months .
just like that .
and your dad ?
he was a doctor .
he escaped into the west .
we haven' t heard anything from him again .
the future was in our hands , uncertain and promising .
good afternoon .
we' re x tv and we just wanted to ...

at the beginning of june 1990 , the borders of our gdr were worthless .
mother kept on sleeping .
we solve problems by making headway " and i acted .
mum ?

your mother' s awakening is a wonder .
but she might not be the same person she used to be .
what do you mean ?
there have been some cases in which the patients didn' t recognize their own children : amnesia .
loss of memory .
sorry .
mental confusion .
blending of long and short term memory ...
taste and smell irritations , delayed perception .
we don' t know , how badly the brain was damaged .
there are a lot of uncertain possibilities .
i' m sorry to have to say this , but mother is still in great danger .
i' m afraid i can' t give you much hope that she' il survive the next few weeks .
well ...
can we take ... her home with us ?
out of the question .
she is in very good hands here .
it' s also simpler for you .
she can' t take another heart attack .
you have to keep your mother away from any excitement , even any danger of excitement .
and i mean any form of excitement , mr. kerner !
any excitement .
it' s life threatening .
and this ?
and this ?
isn' t this a reason to get upset ?

mum has to find the room in the same condition she left it in .
the doctor said she has to stay in bad okay ?
so it' s only about this one room .
and when she' s better , we' il see what we' il do .
you didn' t get what the doctor said .
mum will probably ...
that' s what you said 3 months ago , when you wanted to switch off the machines .
that was a different situation , you can' t compare this !
what do you want to tell her then , ariane ?

but i' il repair that .
alex ?
it' s good to know you' re not alone .
when your father ...
when he was suddenly gone ...
i didn' t think i' d make it .
i never told you that ...
i thought about laying hands upon myself .
but you visited every day .
and you talked about school and sigmund jhn .
you heard that ?
i' m sorry to cause you so much work .
i can' t even use the toilet by myself .
mum .
that doesn' t matter .
the important thing is for you to get well .
i' il try hard .
you have to rest now .
i' il just go to the shop , but ariane is still there .
oh , alex ... ?
i' m craving for spreewood gherkins .
can you fetch me some ?
no problem , mum .
that' s what i thought .
at the end of june 1990 the shops of our socialist fatherland were emptied .
real money was coming in from the country behind the wall .
while most citizens queued in long lines in front of the republic banks with their usual patience ... we were still frantically looking for mother' s bankbook . we were still frantically looking for mother' s bankbook .
yearned for by everyone , the german mark flooded our little community .
halleluja , halleluja ...
halleluja , german mark !
such a day , so wonderful ...
and the money was exchanged 2 to 1 .
germany won 1 : 0 !
unstoppable shot !
germany is one nil up by lothar matthus !

filinchen crispbread ?
not for sale anymore .

these are fine too .
listen , you really don' t have to take care of me all the time .
it' s awkward for me .
mum .
no , really .

then i' il manage by my own .
watching tv still is too tiring for you .
but why ?
why shouldn' t i ... be able to watch tv ?
we' il ask the doctor .
mum , we have to talk to you about something .
it' s like this ...
we wanted to ask you if ...
we need your authorization to access your bank account .
what is it ?
do you need money ?
no .
no .
it' s just that you can' t go walk the bank by yourself anymore .
and it would simply be better if ... you sign this .
yes , and ... maybe now would be best .
but there' s no hurry is there ?
you' re keeping something from me ?

and then you simply gave her the boot .
you still owe her something .
