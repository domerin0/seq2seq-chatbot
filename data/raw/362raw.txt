young people from all over the globe are joining up to fight for the future .
i' m doing my part .
i' m doing my part too .
they' re doing they' re part .
are you ?
join the mobile infantry and save the world .
service guarantees citizenship .
the bugs send another meteor our way .
but this time we' re ready .
planetary defenses are better than ever .
klendathu , source of the bug attacks ... orbits a twin star system whose ... gravitational forces produce an unlimited supply of bug meteorites ...
in the form of this asteroid belt .
to ensure our safety ...
klendathu must be eliminated .
we break net now and take you live ... to klendathu , where the invasion has begun .
dxq uplink on .
two , one , you' re onl
we' ve landed on what cap troopers ... are calling big " k " , with the sixth mobile infantry division .
i\ x9ds an ugly , bug planet .
a planet hostile to life as we know it .
help me !
die !
die !
come on !
go !
keep moving .
get out of here now !
oh , god !
rico .
pay attention .
sorry , mr. rasczak .
le\ x9ds sum up .
this year we explored ... the failure of democracy , how the social scientists brought our world ... to the brink of chaos .
we talked about the veterans , how they took control ... and imposed the stability that has lasted for generations since .
you know these facts .
but have i taught you anything of value ?
you .
why are only citizens allowed to vote ?
i\ x9ds a reward .
what the federation gives you ... for doing federal service .
no .
no !
something given ... has no value .
when you vote you are exercising political authority .
you' re using force .
force , my friends , is violence .
the supreme authority for which all other authority is derived .
my mother says violence never solves anything .
really ?
i wonder what the city fathers of hiroshima would say about that .
you .
they probably wouldn' t say anything .
hiroshima was destroyed .
correct .
naked force has resolved more issues ... throughout history than any other factor .
the contrary opinion that violence never solves anything ... is wishful thinking at its worst .
people who forget that always pay .
wha\ x9ds the moral difference , if any ... between a civilian and a citizen ?
a citizen accepts personal responsibility for the safety ... of the body politic , defending it with his life .
a civilian does not .
exact words of the text .
but do you understand it ?
do you believe it ?
i don' t know .
of course you don' t .
i doubt anyone here ... would recognize civic virtue if it bit you in the ass !
not here .
come on .
le\ x9ds see if they posted the math final .
we gonna take tesla ?
we' re gonna kill' em .
first thing fleet academy looks at is your math scores .
wish me luck .
way to go .
good job .
your turn .
hold on .
i want to talk to marco .
his sister' s at fleet .
hi .
carmen .
she made pilot .
thiry five percent .
very nice .
look at that .
thirty five percent , ladies and gentlemen .
big numbers .
carl !
sorry .
so you haven' t done it yet ?
don' t lie .
i' m not in any hurry .
others are waiting .
did you read her mind ?
don' t have to .
i know what she wants .
yeah , but i want carmen .
aw , you got it bad .
hey , don' t forget about this afternoon .
he' s always late when he walks you home to fish for a kiss .
get out of here .
marco' s sister made pilot !
so will you .
i mean , imagine flying a half a million tons of starship .
you gotta have nerves of steel .
you do .
le\ x9ds see how yours hold up .
you may begin !
oh , come on .
i\ x9ds just a bug .
better put your goggles on .
just a bug .
ha !
we humans like to think we are nature' s finest achievement .
i' m afraid it just isn' t true .
this arkellian sand beetle is superior in many ways .
it reproduces in vast numbers ... has no ego , has no fear ... doesn' t know about death ... and , so , is the perfect , selfless member of society .
but humans have created art , mathematics , and interstellar travel .
true , but before you let that go to your head ... take the example of the arachnids ... a highly evolved insect society .
by human standards they are relatively stupid ... but their evolution stretches over millions of years .
and now ...
take this . they can colonize planets ... by hurling their spore into space .
yeah , i think we got it .
there' s the heart ... and here' s the stomach .
nerves of steel .
huh ?
don' t think about it .
just go on instinct .
try to vi sualize it .
i see the ace of spades .
statistically speaking , you should have accidentally guessed right by now .
try another .
so , my psychic abilities are zero and i' m unlucky .
no , luck' s not a factor .
no one really knows why some people are sensitive and some aren' t .
who knows ?
maybe i\ x9ds a new stage of human evolution .
tha\ x9ds why they do these kind of federal studies .
cyrano !
ah , shit .
time out .
aw , he just wants some attention .
you don' t play with him anymore .
go bug mom , cyrano .
how do you make him do that ?
i gave him the impression there' s a grub crawling up my mom' s leg .
he' s on a mission to go eat it .
get off my leg !
i sure hope you don' t do anything like that to me .
don' t be afraid .
can' t do human .
yet .
all right !
touchdown , tigers .
the score is now 41 to 38 .
tigers lead with 2 : 46 remaining here at the buenos aires sports arena .

all right !
he' s in there !
i\ x9ds over !
who said you could grow up so fast ?
mom , don' t get mushy .
this came for you today .
i presume , at your request .
a lot of my friends are doing federal service .
well , you' re not thinking of applying ?
have you lost your mind ?
i' d rather take ten lashes in public square than see you ruin your life .
i\ x9ds a term of service .
i\ x9ds not a career .
i just want to get out on my own ... see the galaxy for a couple of years .
johnny , people get killed in the federal service .
who gave you this idea ?
i\ x9ds that teacher , isn' t it ?
wha\ x9ds his name ?
you know the one i' m talking about .
silly name .
there should be a law against using a school as a recruiting station .
rasczak doesn' t do that at all .
he sort of discourages you .
well , tha\ x9ds good ...
' cause you' re going to harvard and tha\ x9ds the end of it .
i\ x9ds my decision , not yours .
oh , is that how it is ?
wait , you two .
dad and i have a surprise for you that will settle this .
can you guess what it is ?
you wanted to see the galaxy ?
how about a trip to the outer rings ?
zegema beach .
huh ?
i' ve always wanted to go there .
good .
then i\ x9ds all settled .
sure .
don' t go away .
i' m just gonna go see mr. rasczak .
hey , rico .
you wanna dance ?

i\ x9ds sad ... after tonight , most of us ... probably won' t see each other again .
so , you still gonna play for rio ?
yeah , looks like .
unless tokyo lets me start .
well , anyone who gets you is lucky .
johnny , how come we never got together ?
can' t we just be friends , diz ?
sure .
look , diz , i want to talk to mr. rasczak .
well , you' d better hurry up if you want to catch him .
you' re the best .
what is it , rico ?
i want to thank you .
your class was the best one i had this year .
well , i\ x9ds really not my job to please .
i just hope you learned something .
i want to join up .
i think i got what it takes to be a citizen .
good for you .
go find out .
well , my parents are against it .
i know i\ x9ds my choice .
i was wondering .
what would you do if you were me ?
figuring things out for yourself is the only freedom anyone really has .
use that freedom .
make up your own mind , rico .
but i have not been to paradise
no , i have not been to paradise
watch the days go by
all is well
don' t exaggerate .

federal studies are being conducted in your community .
every school kid knows that arachnids are dangerous .
however , mormon extremists disregarded federal warnings ... and established port joe smith deep inside the arachnid quarantine zone .
too late , they realized that dantana had already been chosen by other colonists ...
arachnids .

i don' t get it .

the only way you' il see combat ... is if you bust yourself to private .
get me ?
yes , sir .
i get you .
sir !
what do you want , rico ?
i wish to reconsider my request to drop out , sir .
you already signed your 1240 a.
it wouldn' t be legal .
major , i know it was wrong .
i didn' t learn from one mistake .
you made your decision , son .
sir , my family ... my whole family ... was in buenos aires , sir .
is this your signature , rico ?
sir , yes , it is , sir !
doesn' t look like it to me .
carry on , private .
out of the ashes of buenos aires comes first sorrow ... then anger .
the only good bug is a dead bug !
in geneva .
we must meet the threat ... with our valor , our blood ... indeed with our very lives ... to ensure that human civilization . dominates this galaxy now and always .
sky marshall dienes announces plans for an offensive against klendathu ... source of the bug meteor that destroyed buenos aires .
every day , federal scientists ... are looking for new ways to kill bugs .
your basic arachnid warrior isn' t too smart ... but you can blow off a limb ... and i\ x9ds still 86 % combat effective .
aim for the nerve stem and put it down for good .
would you like to know more ?
everyone' s doing their part .
are you ?
the war effort needs your effort at work , at home , in your community .
we now break net and take you live ... to fleet battle station ticonderoga deep inside ... the arachnid quarantine zone , where the men and women ... of the federal armed services prepare to attack .
dxq uplink on two , one .
you' re on .
no one here in the aqz knows when the invasion of klendathu will occur ... but everyone' s talking about it , and the talk says tomorrow .
here' s a bunch of m. i. kids who look like they eat bugs for lunch .
yum , yum , yum .
so , trooper , you' re not too worried about fighting the arachnids ?
shoot a nuke down a bug hole , you got a lot of dead bugs .
am i right ?
i just hope i\ x9ds not over before we get some .
some say the bugs were provoked by the intrusion of humans ... into their n atural habitat ... that a " iive and let live " policy is preferable to war with the bugs .
let me tell you something .
i' m from buenos aires ... and i say kill' em all !
big bad bugs , huh ?
hey , guys , we ought to get tattoos .
le\ x9ds all get cut together .
what do i want a tattoo for ?
what ?
your skin' s too pretty ?
come on .
everybody' s doing it .
at ease .
guess i ought to lose the hat when i' m off duty .
my mother was right about you .
you look great in a uniform .
you look pretty good yourself .
so , what do you hear ?
you know about anyone who made it out of b. a. alive ?
most of the time , i don' t think about it .
like it h appened to someone else .
then it hits me , and i can' t stop crying .
well , we' re still alive .
you' ve got to be happy about that .
you don' t look very happy to see me .
should i be ?
johnny , i\ x9ds different now .
we' re at war .
i think what i did was probably ... the best thing for both of us .
everything coposetic , lieutenant ?
zander , you remember johnny ?
zander and i are a flight team now .
we' re the best in the fleet .
i get it .
this is the part tha\ x9ds best for both of us .
don' t do me any more favors .
johnny , wait .
forget it .
he' s mobile infantry .
see , when you' re trained to kill , it just doesn' t pay to be polite .
you got something to say about the mobile infantry ?
i think you heard me .
you wanna make something of it , private ?
not with an officer .
no , sir .
the m. i. doesn' t mint stupid troopers .
well , le\ x9ds disregard rank .
zander , please .
everybody hear that ?
rank is not an issue here .
don' t do this .
come on .
wha\ x9ds he gonna do ?
i' m gonna kill you !
quit it !
he' s not worth it !
forget it , rico .
mobile infantry and fleet don' t mix .
come on , le\ x9ds go .
jarheads !
mobile infantry rules !
oh , god , that hurts !
well , i got something that might hurt just a little bit more , buddy .
oh , yeah !
we' re gonna fight !
and we' re gonna win !
this is the captain .
all personnel prepare for drop .
we are at " d " minus three and counting .
we are going in with the first wave .
means more bugs for us to kill .
you smash the entire area .
kill anything that has more than two legs .
you get me ?
we get you , sir !
plasma , ma' am , from the planet .
bug batteries .
according to military lntelligence , i\ x9dil be random and light .
drop status ?
drop is 35 % complete , ma' am .
steady as she goes , number two .

help me !
come on !

crisis for humankind .
fleet officials admit they underestimated ... the arachnid' s defensive capability .
accepting responsibility for klendathu ...
sky marshall dienes resigns .
his successor , sky marshall tahat meru ... outlines her new strategy .
to fight the bug ... we must understand the bug .
we can ' afford another klendathu .
would you like to know more ?
federal scientists struggle to explain ... the intelligent military actions of the arachnids .
when a colony reaches a certain size ... three hundred generations or something ... it gets smarter .
insects with intelligence ?
have you ever met one ?
i can' t believe i am hearing this nonsense !
this is the most ridiculous conversation i have ever had !
maybe there is some kind of bug that we haven' t seen yet ... a leadership caste of hive brains !
brain bugs ?
frankly , i find the idea ... of a bug that thinks offensive .
ticonderoga , this is rodger young requesting approach vector .
affirmative , rodger young .
one zero zero niner five two .
welcome back .
my god !
how could this happen ?
we thought we were smarter than the bugs .
i\ x9ds strange .
th ere' s almost no wounded at all .

officer on deck .
carry on .

at ease .
how are you , carl ?
carmen , good .
johnny , i' m sorry it had to be your unit on " p.
that mission had a very low survival probability .
the bugs i aid a trap for us , didn' t they ?
elegant proof of intelligence , isn' t it ?
we thought there might be a brain bug on " p.
you knew , and you sent them anyway ?
we couldn' t afford to launch an operation if there wasn' t one .
you don' t approve .
well , too bad .
we' re in this for the species , boys and girls .
i\ x9ds simple numbers .
they have more , and every day ...
i have to make decisions that send hundreds of people to their deaths .
didn' t they tell you , colonel ?
tha\ x9ds what the mobile infantry' s good for .
i hope you' re ready for more .
we' re going back to " p " to capture that brain .

you know . whenever
i feel like things might just work out .
i hope you' re right .
we' ve got one of their brains now .
pretty soon we' il know how they think , and then we' il know how to beat them .
one day , it will all be over ... and everyone will forget that this was the moment .
this is when it turned .
and it wasn' t the mi ghty fleet .
it wasn' t some fancy new weapon .
it was a drill instructor named zim who captured a brain .

he got him !
yeah !
zim got the bug , man !
good job , sergeant .
thank you , sir .
that would be private , sir .
carry on , private .

what mysteries will the brain bug reveal ?
federal scientists are working ... around the clock to probe its secrets .
once we understand the bug , we will defeat it .
we have the ships .
we have the weapons .
we need soldiers .
soldiers like lieutenant stack lumbreiser ...

this is the captain speaking .
all personnel prepare for drop .
