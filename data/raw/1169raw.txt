a case in point in anger' s ability to change us is my mother .
my mother was always the nicest person i ever knew .
she was the nicest , sweetest woman than anyone who knew her ever knew .
then things changed ... then she changed .
she got angry .
good and angry .
anger has turned my mother into a very sad and bitter woman .
if she wasn' t my mother , i' d slap her .
i would .
i' d look her straight in the face and tell her what i really think of her ... and then i' d run really fast in the opposite direction .
are you eating ?
yes .
i want you eating .
i mean it .
okay .
you ladies are old enough now ,
i' m not gonna pull any punches here .
he took his wallet ... and he left .
when he didn' t come home the other night , you know , i thought we got lucky and he was just in a car crash , dead by the side of the road , but the fact is , he' s run off with his little swedish secretary , who , oh , what a coincidence , mysteriously left work three days ago and moved back to sweden !
but where did he go ?
have you spoken to him ?
no , i haven' t spoken to him .
there is very little to say .
he knows that .
but i did cut off all his goddamn credit cards .

grey doesn' t live here anymore , denny .
he doesn' t exist .

officials tell us that they are worried about how to manage the fragile us led coalition in the days ahead , but the facts are already evident from south asia , to africa , to the middle east .
worldwide , thousands of angry demonstrators are taking to the streets to protest us military ...
the least he could have done was taken this stupid jock with him .

they lose their jobs , and they go nuts .
what do you want from me ?
it' s the best that i can come up with .
i don' t want anything from you .

to my baby .
my first born , my little hadley wadley .
aww .
that' s what we called her .
hadley wadley .
she was so loved from the minute she was born .
just an adorable little thing .
she was ... well , she grew up too fast didn' t she ?
she grew up so fast and had a mouth on her .

when she was in her teens she was her own little boss .

i made an ass of myself .
i was like ... a public service film against drinking .
just ... yeah , i was an old lush .
poor hadley .
i feel so bad for her , denny .
why are we going out here ?
i hate the way i come off to my girls .
i just hate that i can' t control my emotions .
oh god .
this is creepy .
this was all a farm owned by the ...
firestone family until the 50' s .
this and the whole subdivision .
it goes on a bit about another eight acres .
why are we out here today ?
i wanna do it .
out here ?
no .
don' t be an asshole .
i wanna sell my part of it .
just let your friends develop the lots and tell them " yes .
tell them i don' t need the money , though .
if they think i need the money , they' il play games with me .
do you ?
no .
yes .
no .
i don' t know .
i' m in some trouble ... unless i officially divorce the shitbox which i refuse to do , until at least he has the balls to show his face .
i wanna give the girls the money .
just tell your friend shep i want to make the deal .
what ?
nothin ' .
good .
i' m going in .
this place is a clearinghouse for lime disease .
hey , this is cute .
shep ...
how are you , pal ?
i' m doing great .
i' m hanging with andy , how could i not be ?
hello , terry .
hadley ...
hadley' s boyfriend .
okay , okay .
we' re gonna go watch a movie .
isn' t that sweet ?
the bicycle thief .
she' s never seen " the bicycle thief .
he' s a nut for foreign cinema .
anyone wanna join us ?
snuggle up on the couch ?
watch a classic ?
i think we' il , uh , probably pass .
is it the subtitles ?
you know me too well .
i do and it' s a burden .
i know him too well ...
okay .
so it' s a burden .
that' s it .
okay .
i cannot tell you how much this thing disgusts me .
oh , come on .
she' s doing great at work .
shep' s got her producing morning drive time , plus ...
i think he really likes her .
oh , the whole thing just infuriates me .
that' s probably half the attraction .
what ?
you know what .
not another word .
the deep hatred that men have felt for one another through the ages has blossomed into one chapter after another of repression , violence , hate , rape , religious slang and genocide .
i' m still working on it .
i need to fix the music .
it' s my final in television production .
you' re really handsome , gorden .
thanks .
i should go .
i really do have to go .
the power of stress and naked anger is seen over and over again in the relationships that exist between the male and the female of our species .
here , in rural botswana , an unfaithful tribeswoman is brought to a field by a group of locals for a ritualized punishment of beating and harassment .
events quickly spiral out of control for the tribesmen , though as the woman' s fury becomes too great to contain and the men are quickly forced to flee for their safety .
why am i not excited by it ?
um , because i don' t think any of these new age arts colleges are really colleges .
of course , it' s a college .
what are you talking about ?
honey , i' ve been there .
i have .
i wanted to be a poet , remember ?
just take arts courses at ann arbor .
i don' t want to go to school in ann arbor .
no , of course you don' t .
it' s what i want you to do .
why would you ?
okay , four years learning dance theory ?
i have a theory about that .
it' s not going to happen .
how' s the show ?
you enjoying it ?
i wish you would take me seriously .
honey , i take you seriously .
i just don' t think you have much capacity for self evaluation .
you know , you' d think you' d be happy for me ... considering the way your life turned out .
the way your parents pushed you ...
to marry your father ?
yeah .
i' m not complaining .
they pushed me to take life seriously ... not to live in the clouds .
do you have any idea what a fucking idiot you sound like sometimes ?
i love how you worry that the letter you sent to the parent who deserted you is too mean , and yet , to the one who' s here in the fight , you have no problem saying the most vile things .
isn' t that a tad odd ?
please finish setting the table .
fuck you !
shep , wake up .
wake up , wake up .
hey .
oh , it' s 5 : 00 .
okay , 5 : 00 .
just ...
no , my mother' s downstairs we need to get up .
we need to get up right ...
ah , hello !
okay , not now .
we need to get ...
no , we need to get up .
and ...
my ...
g ...
god !
wow .
that was weird , huh ?
yeah .
and according to a recent report , the average male waist size in the united states has increased four sizes in the last 10 years .
from 34 to 38 .
see , here' s my question .
when are they going to stop calling it ' average ? '
just start calling it what it is .
fat ass !
you have a fat ass !
say something to her .
go in there .
no .
do you mind if i do ?
yes , i do mind .
quite a bit .
all right .
well ...
well what ?
well ...
i didn' t quite actually have the end of that thought worked out .
it' s late .
i think you should go home , denny .
i think it' s going to be nothing but trouble , you staying here tonight .
well , if you want me to leave , just say so .
that was a joke .
... english national ballet school under the direction of katherine wade perform their highly acclaimed production ...
can we talk ?
not now , i have a stomachache .
well , can i get you anything ?
no , but you can shut the door .
i' m gay .
what ?
no .
no , no , no .
you' re not .
yeah .
i am .
are you lying to get out of kissing me ?
have you ever had gay sex ?
what about sex with a woman ?
look , you can' t be gay if you haven' t tried it .
or at least tried it with a girl to know that you don' t like it with girls .
no .
i like men , because i' m gay .
i think you' re lying .
i do , and i think it' s mean .
have sex with me .
just try it and then , if you want to be gay , you can be gay .
that' s nice of you .
hi .
um , i came to apologize .
did you ?
i did .
i' ve been a real shit to you .
yes , you have .
what' s this ?
well , i just want to do something nice for you .
i want to clean your house .
what if i don' t want my house cleaned ?
well , come on .
just don' t be defensive and shitty because i' ve been shitty .
let us in , okay ?
no .
no .
no , come on .
we' re not gonna destroy it , we' re gonna clean it .
i don' t want my house cleaned , terry , okay ?
i just want you to be nice to me , okay ?
you know something ?
what ?
nothing .
right .
then move , i' m coming in to clean .
these ... are all inventoried , okay ?
i know how many boxes are here .
and what does that mean ?
you know what it means .
i don' t know this crew .
you don' t either .
this is why i don' t like people over .
i don' t like too many people knowing what i have here .
they' re balls , denny , not gold bullion .
yeah , well ... say what you want but they keep me in firewood .
i do what i have to do .
i' m not ashamed .
i didn' t say you should be .
other ...
other guys i played with , they , uh ... pulled car dealerships out their asses , you know , ran insurance companies after they retired ?
that wasn' t me .
i get by , though .
you wanna have a drink ?
you know me pretty well , what do you think ?
so what is it about you and baseball ?
aw , come on , why don' t you just call in to the show if you' re gonna hit me with that one .
come on , really .
what are you so touchy about ?
nothing .
i' m just not sure what they want from me anymore , you know ?
it was good .
it was grand .
nice .
next .
it' s over .
i don' t want to talk about it anymore .
and i realize i' m a walking contradiction .
you know , hocking balls ... going to malls , having my picture taken in a room full of fat fucks .
it' s just ... you know , it' s ...
i' m ...
i' m tired , okay ?
i' m just ...
yeah , i know .
moving ahead is hard .
no , i don' t have a problem with moving ahead .
you know what it is i like about going over to your house , terry ?
i like how it smells .
something' s always cooking .
my house doesn' t smell like that .
and i don' t even mind going over there when there' s tension , and there' s a ... there' s a fucking lot of it , you know ?
somebody is always mad at somebody .
doors are slammin ' .
fur' s flyin ' .
even when no one is talkin ' , it' s ... it' s loud .
but at least it' s fucking real .
believe me , this is not where i saw my life going , okay ?
this is not how i would' ve drawn it .
but i' m okay with all of it .
well ...
lucky me .
no .
no .
lucky me .
when i' m with you , terry ... with your girls ...
i feel like there' s a big chunk of my life still left to be played out .
and that' s what i want to talk about , not ... baseball .
i' ve had my heart broken really badly , denny .
i know .
it' s not the kind of thing that ever heals .
yeah , it does .
it heals .
it just heals funny .
you know , you more or less walk ... with a limp .
well , we' il ... we' il figure out a way to be okay with that .
you know ... with the limp .
# oh , she may be weary #
# and young girls , they do get weary #
# wearing that ... #
# mm hmm . #
i' m showing .
i can' t ...
i' m so pissed off i' m showing .
well , you' re not showing that bad .
another two weeks , and we' d have to elope .
i have to go get my bracelet .
i hate the fact that so many people know she' s pregnant .
half of them , she' s told .
i think she' s actually
proud of herself for this .
what' s the big deal ?
she would have gotten married anyway .
i know , sweetie , she' s a doll .
i just wish she could learn to keep her goddamn mouth shut .
hey .
do i look horrible ?
no .
tell me the truth .
are you kidding ?
you ... are ... a beautiful , gorgeous bride .
i am ?
yes .
you are .
you look perfect in that dress .
elegant and classy and sexy and fresh and your skin looks great .
and your face is big and plump and healthy looking .
oh , i could just eat you up !
my face is plump ?
oh , god .
no , i didn' t ...
my ...
i didn' t mean plump as in plump .
you said my face looks plump .
no , i meant plump like " adorable .
liar !
i did !
sweetheart ...
i have a fat face on my wedding day and you ... you know it !
you do not have a fat face , a plump face , she didn' t mean it , i swear .
she just told me my face looked fat .
sweetheart ... honey ...
you' re ... wh ... 10 minutes before my wedding ceremony ?
that' s just mean .
well , what about all the beautiful things that i said with that ?
can we focus on those ?
right , right , right .
nice fat face , hadley .
go get married .
hadley !
ha ...
hadley ...
okay .
she' il be fine . ... what potential the bonds of marriage hold for us .
to walk together into the fog of the future .
two partners , together ... in concert ... in tandem ... in holy matrimony .
is any bond as sacred as this one ?
is any promise more permanent ?
# girl #

you manipulate young women , use your power and title to seduce them , and get them to run around with you .
yeah , so ?

i don' t want her to be scared , okay ?
i' il be fine .
# can i help it if i' m bolder ? #
# can i help it if i' m faithful ? #
at this point , i can' t say much .
could be an ulcer , could be pancreatic .
i don' t know .
i' m at a loss for tonight .
what ?
you' re at a loss ?
she' s in a lot of pain .
i had to put her out and let her sleep .
i can' t do anything until the morning .
well , what are you gonna do in the morning ?
actually , i won' t be here in the morning .
i' m at the end of a long shift , but tests will be taken and tomorrow night , when i come back
i' il look at them and we' il talk .
tomorrow night ?
yes .
and what if i want a second opinion ?
well , i haven' t given you a first one yet .
and if i want a second opinion ?
it' s 4 : 30 am .
i don' t think you' re going to get a strong one .
well , why would they do something like that ?
because i didn' t give them candy , that' s why .
great .
you' re standing at the door with a bowl of candy , why can' t you ...
because i don' t accept 15 year old girls with no costume on .
if you don' t have a costume on ,
you shouldn' t be allowed ...
who cares ? !
they' re just using halloween to get candy !
who cares ? !
it' s halloween !
just give them candy !
it' s okay to use a holiday for your own selfish purposes ? !
oh , so what ? !
so you' d rather just have them toiletpaper your house ?
well , i didn' t know it was gonna be " felony or treat !
i don' t ...
i didn' t think that trick extended to felony !
why would it kill you just to give ' em a few pieces of candy ? !
i don' t understand that !
because there' s gotta be some kind of cut off !
shouldn' t there be for halloween ?
bob , what is with you and your cut offs and your shouldn' t there be and should there be ... who cares ? !
she' s really sick .
and the worst thing is they don' t know what it is .
i mean , it could be an ulcer , it could be thyroid .
it , uh ...
she can' t eat and ... you know , it could be cancer .
it could be ... it could be so many things .
i don' t know what it is .
i don' t know what it is .
oh god .
directory assistance .
um , yes , operator .
i would like , um ,
i' m looking for directory assistance for karlstad , sweden .
you said " karlstad , sweden ?
yes , thank you .
look at you all alone in here .
i like it like this .
did you call daddy to tell him ?
um ...
no , i didn' t .
i don' t hate him .
i mean , you know , i know that you do , but i' ve , uh , been thinking about it , and i just don' t .
did you talk to the doctor ?
yes .
did he tell you it wasn' t cancer ?
yes , he did .
thank god .
he thinks that whatever it is might be stress related .
an ulcer , maybe .
he' s very worried that you' re under too much stress , emily .
i' m not stressed .
yes , you are .
you are .
you' re mad .
mad at me .
mad at daddy .
i can see that all the time .
you' ve got a cloud over your head .
we need to get it to go away .
give you some air .
the doctor' s very worried , emily .
maybe yoga .
stop it .
i' m serious .
well , so am i.
you can' t dance or exercise your way out of this .
you need to get better , emily .
i can take a lot , but i couldn' t take losing you .
why is that funny ?
because you just don' t seem to care all that much about me , unless , like now , i' m sick .
that' s not true .
that' s just not true .
i adore you .
you do ?
i do !
i don' t see that .
well , what can i say ?
you' re like everybody else in my life you need to pay closer attention to me .
okay .
how' s the wind , dad ?
fantastic !
whoa !
yeah !

the only thing i understand about this ... is the screaming .
whoo !
hey , hey !
so , how does this work now ?
you going next , gorden ?
hell no .
he won' t jump .
he' s too scared .
he' s a watcher .
you' re not gonna jump ?
no , he won' t jump .
i' il go again , unless you wanna take a shot .
nope .
not me .
i' m a watcher too .
are you gonna marry my mother ?
i don' t know .
it' s , um ... it' s tough .
your mom , she' s ... she' s tricky .
she didn' t used to be .
ask anyone .
she was always sweet .
you should marry her , denny .
would that make you happy ?
it would , yeah .
mmn .
so , uh ... your daughter asked me if i was going to marry you , today .
oh , please .
that' s a cheap shot .
what do you mean ?
she' s , um ... she' s adorable .
i know she is .
it wasn' t a cheap shot , terry .
what ?
bringing up what ... bringing up what popeye said .
it wasn' t , um ... it wasn' t a cheap shot .
i have enough problems right now , denny .
i don' t need you using my daughter as a pawn .
what are you talking about ?
i have a child incredibly ill in the hospital .
another one' s sleeping with a pervert that you brought into her life , so i don' t want to get into something silly
like a cute talk about a marriage that we both know would be doomed from the start , so you know what i' m talking about .
don' t .
i don' t wanna hear what popeye said , no .
i am so sick of being your bitch .
i put up with your shit , because i know how much pain you' re in .
but it' s enough !
it' s a tall order for a patient motherfucker , and i am the farthest thing from that that you' re ever gonna lay eyes on .
... tomorrow .
denny ?
can i talk to you for a second ?
yeah , i i i can do this tomorrow .
bad news .
you ready ?
management has a bug up their ass .
okay , they' ve been getting a lot of calls .
i' ve been trying to keep this from you , but they want to renegotiate .
renegotiate what ?
come on , you know what .
they want you to talk baseball .
what ?
either that or they want to take us off the air .
good gag .
it' s not a gag , denny .
i wish it was a gag .
it' s not a gag .
you either talk baseball , or we go off the air next week .
i don' t wanna talk baseball .
big deal .
they didn' t want to have a sports talk show in the middle of a day with an all rock format , but i talked them into it .
guess what ?
you' re a baseball star .
that' s what people want to hear from you .
baseball talk .
nobody wants to hear your cooking and your stock tips , denny .
i' m sorry , but it' s true .

you were hitting on her .
i wasn' t hitting on her , den .
you' re over reacting .

thanks for going to this .
oh , i know it means a lot to you .
mom , did you call him ?
did you ever call him ?
no , i didn' t .
and you know ... you know , i don' t need to .
the doctor says you' re improving .
you' re not wiggin ' out about this , are you ?
stressing out ?
jeez .
terry ?
i don' t mean to be the girl here , but we' re gonna be late .
people don' t know how to love .
they bite rather than kiss , and they slap rather than stroke .
maybe it' s because they realize how easy it is for love to go bad , to become suddenly impossible ... unworkable , an exercise in futility .
so they avoid it and seek solace in angst and fear and aggression , which are always there and readily available .
or maybe sometimes ... they just don' t have all the facts .
in here ?
holy mother of shit .
what is it ?
what is it ?
what is it ?
you' d better go back , okay ?
just ...
i' il be right there .
look ... no , no .
no , what is it ?
we pulled this jacket up , found a wallet .
go back , terry .
look , i mean it , honey .
i mean it .
go back , go back no , i don' t wanna go back .
terry , please .
give me the flashlight .
baby , no .
no .
give it to me .
give it to me .
give me the flashlight , denny .
give it to me !
it' s an old water well .
all covered up .
he must have ... come out to walk the property and fallen through .
you guys sh should go call the police .
oh my god .
oh god .
... to honor ... ... our sense of loss .
what is the price we' ve paid ?
what is the price we' ve paid for ...
anger and resentment can stop you in your tracks .
that' s what i know now .
it needs nothing to burn but the air and the life that it swallows and smothers .
what ?
what ?
okay .
whoa !
it' s real , though ... the fury , even when it isn' t .
it can change you ... turn you ... mold you and shape you into someone you' re not .
the only upside to anger , then ... is the person you become ...
good job .
... hopefully someone that wakes up one day and realizes they' re not afraid of its journey , someone that knows that the truth is , at best , a partially told story .
that anger , like growth , comes in spurts and fits and in its wake ,
leaves a new chance at acceptance and the promise of calm .
then again , what do i know ?
i' m only a child .
