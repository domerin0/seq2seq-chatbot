that' s my mom' s rehearsal dinner .
anna , come on .
this is really important .
you know , don' t worry .
i' il be there .
how can you ?
aren' t you the maid of horror or something ?
honor .
it' s not the wedding .
it' s the rehearsal .
don' t they make a big deal out of the rehearsal ,
like all your weird relatives coming to town ?
no , they don' t .
there' s my anna banana !
give your grampy doodle a big huggy buggy .
grandpa , over here .
oh .
hey , gramps .
don' t worry .
i would never let you down .
just don' t cancel the audition yet .
i' m gonna talk to my mom .
all right .
we' re screwed .
yep .
yeah .
i don' t think he knows i exist .
it' s stupid to think about him , but i can' t help it .
jake !
ooh , jake !
get out of my room !
oh !
my ... my ...
ah !
aaaaah !
she saw it .
i' m gonna check out those lakers .
i' m with you .
mom !
mom , did you see what happened to my door ?
i spoke to your principal .
what ?
just now on the phone .
where' s my door ?
privacy is a privilege .
where is my door , mom ?
your door will be returned to you , anna , if and when you can explain ...
you give me that door , or i will kill myself .
oh !
can i watch ?
harry !
shut up !
aaaaah !
i think we can dispense with the drama .
maybe you can calmly explain to me why you were in detention twice today .
okay , i went to detention .
that was because stacey hinkhouse kept hitting me with a volleyball .
when is this conflict with stacey hinkhouse going to end ?
never , because she' s an insane , psycho freak .
you' d know that if you paid a speck of attention .
anna !
what ?
i think you know i pay attention , anna .
enough to know that you got an " f " in english today .
well , mr. bates is out to get me .
oh , him too ?
yeah .
he just looks for ways to torture me .
like today , the one time jake spoke to me , he totally ...
who' s jake ?
he' s just nobody .
you say i' m not interested , anna .
i' m interested .
try me .
okay , he' s just this really amazing guy , mom .
where' d you meet him ?
detention , but ...
that' s promising .
do you see ?
why do i bother telling you anything ?
do you see ?
why do i bother telling you anything ?
okay .
who' s up for chinese ?
aah !
you' re ruining my life !
i' m moving out and never coming back ever , ever , ever again !
hello .
how are you ?
hello , pei pei .
anna , harry , you' re so big now .
what happened ?
are you happy for your mommy ?

oh .
she' s such a joker .
who' s catering ?
chinese food good luck .
it' s all planned already .
okay , how about me ?
i preordered the peking duck .
joy .
i know that' s your favorite .
whatever .
the wedding is in two days .
think about it .
see you soon .
happy dining .
anna , your door is underneath the back stairs .
like i didn' t figure that out .
stop groveling , man .
let her come to you .
she' d come with a hatchet .
i think i' il go check on that duck .
anna .
do you think that your surliness is the best way for you to get what you want ?
i' m sorry , mom .
i really have been stressing in school , and i deserved every single one of those trips to detention .
and i' m gonna apologize to stacey hinkhouse and mr. bates .
i guess what i' m trying to say is , i' il try and do better , mom .
i' il really , really try .
all right , what do you want ?
to go to this audition tomorrow that we can never have again at the house of blues .
an audition , that' s great .
tomorrow ?
you mean after the rehearsal dinner ?
well , during .
during .
you mean as " instead of " ?
technically ?
i need to talk to you right now .
i' m gonna pass on that .
now !
anna .
i am going to make one final attempt to understand what goes on in your head .
don' t treat me like your patients .
what ?
all calm and reasonable .
let' s talk .
i want to understand .
i really do want to understand , anna !
tsk , tsk , tsk .
oh , mama , stay out of it , please .
mama .
okay , fine .
they' re gonna pick one local band to play at wango tango .
we were lucky to make this cut .
it' s a once in a lifetime chance .
please .
why can' t i just go ?
please .
what i hear is that my special night means absolutely nothing to you .
i don' t have to ask if my band means anything to you .
it' s clear you think we' re all noise .
look , i' m a walrus .
i do not !
do too !
anna , i let you practice in the garage .
anna , stop .
what ?
let' s talk about what this is really about .
this is about your dad .
mom , stop shrinking me .
it' s not about dad .
it' s about the audition !
you' re ruining my life !
enough with the drama .
anna , high school is not that hard .
you couldn' t last one day in my high school .
i could , and i would do it without getting a detention .
i' m sorry i' m the one thing in your life that isn' t perfect !
you think my life is perfect ?
i know your life is perfect .
your perfect job , perfect boyfriend , perfect patients who worship the ground you walk on .
you need a serious and bracing reality check if you think my life is perfect !
you can cut me some slack this once .
i am beyond cutting you slack , anna .
you are not going to the audition .
i am !
no , you' re not !
why not ?
because i said so !
cookie ?
this isn' t really a good time .
now a good time .
okay , okay .
thank you .
anna , for one day , the entirety of our life is not gonna be focused on you .
yeah , it' s all about ryan now , isn' t it ?
anna !
get away .
honey !
a journey soon begins , its prize reflected in another' s eyes .
when what you see is what you lack , then selfless love will change you back .
whatever .
honey ?
you okay ?
yeah .
whew .
come on .
did you feel that ?
feel what ?
there was an earthquake .
no , there wasn' t .
yes , there was .

there was no earthquake .
you didn' t feel it ?
no .
i don' t think so .

i can' t marry ryan .
ew !
okay .
okay , okay , okay .

i have no idea .
mom , maybe we should go to the emergency room .
oh , no .
all that will get us is a 72 hour lockdown in the psych ward and a thorazine drip .
no , we' re not going anywhere .
okay .
so you' re in my body , and i' m in your body .
why don' t we , like ...
yes , yes , i see what you' re saying .

hey , mom , can i ...

okay , that was stupid .
harry !
i was just teaching mom some new dance moves .
what do you want , punk ?
you cannot talk to him like that .
he thinks you' re his mother .
we' re gonna to have to tell him .
we' re not going to tell anyone .
they' il think we' re crazy .
maybe we are crazy .
i for one am not crazy .
i' m merely a grown woman trapped in my daughter' s body .
oh , god , i am crazy .
grandpa , could you pass the milk ?
okay .
harry' s still harry , and grandpa' s still grandpa .
so it' s just us .

you' re going .
i' il , like , go get your dad .
alan , that' s not our car !
the earthquake and then pei pei' s crazy mother pointing at me and you .
and what was she mumbling about in chinese ?
she did something .
some strange asian voodoo .
what are we gonna do now ?
i can' t go to school like this .
you have to .
you' re on the verge of suspension , and you have your honors qualifying exam today .
all the more reason to stay home .
i could go and take the exam for you .
i' m sure a high test would be simple for me .
are you kidding ?
you think you can be me ?
of course i can .
watch me .
oh , everyone' s out to get me .
you' re ruining my life .
it' s easy to be you .
i' il suck the fun out of everything .
i do not suck the fun out of everything .
fun sucker .
oh , this is ridiculous .
i will go to school , and you will stay right ...
what ?
evan .
evan ?
who' s evan ?
my neediest patient .
i' ve been seeing him every day for three years .
ooh , bummer .
maybe just my face would be reassuring .
no way .
unh unh .
i am not babysitting some 40 year old wack job .
what am i supposed to say to the freak ?
nothing .
you are in no way to give anyone any advice .
that would be unethical .
just listen attentively , nod occasionally , and if you must speak , simply say ,
how do you feel about that ?
you' re serious .
you really want us to be each other ?
we will get through this morning as each other , and we will go to the restaurant at lunch and get switched back .
go get dressed .
well , good luck getting dressed without a door .
thank you .
oh , boy .
you' il get used to it .
what ?
you pierced your navel ?
yeah .
i meant to talk to you about that .
when did you do this ?
at maddie' s cousin' s sweet 16 .
well , when you get your body back , it' s grounded .
and what are you doing ?
i don' t know why you never wear these .
they' re cute .
yeah , if you' re selling bibles .
and what did you do to my hair ?
i' ve been dying to comb these rats out .
now you can see your pretty face .
and what is this ?
oh , i fixed your jeans .
my patients are not going to pay $ 150 an hour to get therapy from a stripper .
all right .
i' il drab up .
i' il grunge down .
go .
what' s up ?
feet down .
harry , could you settle down ?
bite me !
do you see what he does behind your back ?
anna !
mom .
excuse me .
and while i' m apologizing , let me just say to the whole car how truly sorry i am for being such an insane control freak all the time .
you' re not controlling , mom .
i' m the one who should be apologizing for my flagrant disregard for anyone' s feelings but my own .
well , at least you have a great sense of style .
not like me .
enough .
platinum , cool .
don' t even think about it .
am i supposed to follow this ?
it' s nothing , darling .
one more day .
yeah , it' s great we' re getting married , isn' t it ?
even though my husband died .
how quickly i' ve been able to get over it .
just pull up here .
mom , out of the car .
if you manage to alienate ryan in my body .
i' il be nice .
but don' t kiss him .
oh , mom , i just had breakfast .
that' s disgusting .
nice .
okay .
here is the number for the cab company .
i want you back here at 11 : 45 sharp .
all right .
do you understand ?
all right !
what is that tone ?
are you using a tone with me ?
oh , my god .
can i go ?
why ?
what are you so anxious about ?
hey , anna .
do you know him ?
kinda .
that' s jake .
no , no .
you gotta give him a chance .
that is the last thing i' m going to give him .
you don' t even know him .
i know he' s too old for you .
my god , he' s coming over .

hi , jake .
hey .

harry , do you know who that is ?
anna' s got a boyfriend .
k l s s l n g.
okay , where are we going next ?
harry' s school ?
oh , he can walk from here .

nothing .
and you girls would do well to follow my example .
well .
whoa , whoa !

i' m going to ask each one of you one question , and you will be graded according to your answer .
oh , thank god it' s " hamlet .
i was in that play in high ...
i just know the play .
like that' il help you .
mr. waters , describe the character of hamlet .
hamlet .
he' s , uh ... he' s one of the big characters .
i mean , he' s hamlet .
he' s just bopping around , doesn' t know which way' s up .
i don' t think the guy' s got a clue .
you mean to say that he is a man ...
yeah .
who couldn' t make up his ...
mind .
mind .
exactly .
very good .
all right .
" b.
yeah .
ms. coleman .
yes , mr. bates ?
what are the central conflicts in " hamlet " ?
well , political , of course , because claudius usurped his father' s throne .
oedipal , because of the undercurrents with his mother .
then there is the timeless question of insanity .
is he really seeing his father' s ghost , or is he simply mad ?
that is seriously overreaching .
f.
" f " ?
" f.
mr. franelli , who is fortinbras ?
i started reading your new book , and it just makes me feel really depressed .

that' s bad .
bad mom " award .
but i' m concerned , doctor , that she and this boy might be ,
i mean , you know .
stop !
stop !
nothing is going on between her and this guy .
if there was , she wouldn' t be writing about it .
she' d be out there doing it .
her best friend probably isn' t talking to her because she probably likes this guy , too .
and he probably flirted with her a little , but he secretly likes your daughter .
he hasn' t made his move yet because that wouldn' t be cool .
so now her best friend is acting like some psycho freak .
okay ?
that' s very interesting .
i never would have thought about it that way .
cool .
guess we' re done .
mr. bates , may i please speak with you ?
i think that would be fairly pointless , but go ahead .
by what stretch of the imagination ...
i mean , like , how could i , like , get an " f " ?
what mistakes did i make ?
grading is subjective .
that was a college level analysis .
and you' re qualified to make that assessment ?
i most certainly am .
well , in the words of hamlet , " what' s done is done .
that' s " macbeth , " you know nothing twit .
bates .
elton bates .
griffith high school .
how do you know that ?
well , you asked me , i mean , my mom to the prom , but she turned you down .
this is not an appropriate subject .
you' re taking it out on her daughter , aren' t you ?
i don' t know what you' re talking about .
it was a high school dance .
you' ve got to let it go and move on , man .
and if you don' t , i' m sure the school board would love to hear about your pathetic vendetta against an innocent student .
oh , and by the way , elton , she had a boyfriend , and you were weird .
that was amazing .
you totally destroyed him .
i don' t think elton bates will be giving me much trouble .
that' s so weird about your mom .
oh , yeah , what did she say ?
about what ?
about the audition .
oh , right .
she said no .
what ?
well , it is her rehearsal dinner .
don' t you think that' s rather important , too ?
and you told her ?
you told her this chance would never come again ?
she sympathizes .
don' t give us this .
she is totally ruining our lives .
you' re the culprit .
yeah , your mom has never cared about our music .
never cared ?
never cared ?
who do you think paid for those guitar lessons ?
and did she ever hear a " thank you " ?
no .
come on , you said it yourself .
your mom hasn' t paid attention to you since she started dating that guy .
that' s not true .
well , you talk about it enough .
i do ?
what is up with you today ?
you act like you don' t even care about this band .
look , girls ... guys , if it were any other night .
whatever , anna .
god .
you picked up my car !
yeah .
get out of the car .
i' m driving .
oh , my god .
what have you done to me ?
do you like it ?
get out of the car right now !
do you have your permit ?
no .
my hair .
it' s gone !
what have you done to my ear ?
mom , it' s an earring !
take it out right now !
no .
it looks cool .
don' t start with me .
those clothes are going back tomorrow !
why ?
everyone likes them .
you look great .
i look like stevie nicks .
who' s he ?
what are you doing with this ?
i' m eating .
you cannot eat fast food .
why not ?
because it will go down your throat and drop instantly to my thighs .
oh , come on .
watch the road .
oh , this food may make you blow up like a balloon , but it will do nothing whatsoever to me .
oh , mom !
oh , god , this is good .
mom , that' s not fair .
my first french fry in eight years .
i can hear the " hallelujah chorus .
road !
oh , hi , hi .
you back so soon .
sexy new look for you , mrs. coleman .
you look hot .
two for lunch ?
no , pei pei .
we' d like to speak to you about something we think happened to us at your restaurant .
something that sucks .
let me handle this .
okay .
when we woke up this morning , we weren' t ourselves .
yeah .
oh .
mama !
hey , hey !
you come back here .
hello , hello .

she don' t know what you' re talking about .
okay , let' s have lunch .
let' s eat .
you know exactly what we' re talking about .
let' s hit her .
okay , okay .
i cannot fix it .
only you can fix it .
when the fortune come true , then you go back .
what fortune ?
from the fortune cookie .
you find the answer in each other .
when the fortune come true , then you go back , okay ?
no big deal .
you mean , we' re stuck in this suck fest ?
you' re not going to do anything ?
how about 10 % off catering ?
no , pei pei , we have a caterer .
actually , mom , there' s something i forgot to tell you .
okay , good idea , how about i do ?
what did that fortune say ?
like i remember ?
i don' t remember , either .
oh , i hate this !
i don' t wanna get married at 15 !
it' s not even legal !
i want my room back .
i want my friends .
i want to eat whatever i want when i want .
mommy .
i know , sweetie .
it' s a hard day .
we' il get through it .
breathe .
deep breath .
we' il go home and find the fortune .
make it stop !
oh , my organizer .
it' s been going off all day .
parent teacher conference !
i completely forgot !
you have to be at harry' s school in 15 minutes .
no !
i hate teachers !
you have to go .
i' il go to your school .
i' il take your exam , and everything will be okay .
okay , let' s go .
mom ?
yeah .
whatever .
mrs. coleman .
all right , let' s do this thing .
okay .
well , what can i say about harry ?
he is a sweet boy .
but he' s having a little trouble with bullies .
so ?
that' s character building .
kid needs to toughen up .
he' s kind of a wimp .
so , that' s it ?
i can go ?
no , not exactly .
harry' s very bright , but he' s having a problem applying himself , particularly in math .
so , hold him back .
i mean , he' s short .
he' il fit in , you know what i mean ?
well , you know , he' s very good in english .
i had the class write an essay on who they admire most , and he wrote a wonderful paper about your daughter .
so , what' d she say ?
she showed me the paper you wrote about anna .
you saw that ?
mm hmm .
well , don' t tell her i like her .
well , why not ?
because we have too much fun fighting .
you know , kid , you are way more twisted than i thought .
good try !
oh , man !
loser !
good luck flunking .
stacey , i want to talk to you .
come here .
why this falling out ?
we were best friends in sixth grade .
i know i got involved with my music , and you became involved with your cheerleading , but why does this have to be world war ill ?
all those years of trick or treating and sleepovers .
don' t you remember any of it ?
i know i do .
i mean , how do you feel about that ?
all right , let' s all take our seats for the test .
sit with me ?
communication .
that' s all it takes .
hey , there you are .
ooh !

through the looking glass .
senescence .

the sum of the areas of the shaded regions in terms of ' d ' is equal to a , ' d ' squared times the sum of pi divided by four minus ' d ' divided by two .
b , ' d ' squared times the sum of pi cubed divided by ' d ' minus two .
now , what is pi again ?
three point something ?
oh , this is ridiculous .
i' ve never used pi .
anna' s never gonna use pi !
why is it called pi anyway ?
okay , focus .
or " c , ' d ' cubed minus the sum of pi squared .
psst !
miss brown , she' s copying my test !
hey , cheater .
i did not cheat .
that stacey hinkhouse is conniving .
it' s your business .
i did not cheat .
don' t you smirk at me .
if you' re so perfect , why are you in detention all the time ?
i' m not in detention .
i work here .
what would you say if i told you i could help finish your test ?

do you know what it means ?
no .
please do sit still .

we' re here with dr. tess coleman , author of " through the looking glass ,
senescence in retrograde .
so , doctor , tell us about your new book .
well .
i wrote it .
yes , you did .
but tell us , what got you interested in the physical and intellectual exhaustion that seems to overcome those of us who are , let' s say , no longer 20 .
senescence , like senile !
old people !
got it !
got it !
and let' s face it , we are tired much of the time .
that' s why i' ve been craving caffeine all day .
i thought i was dying .
but you still haven' t answered the fundamental question .
why are we so tired ?
well , of course we' re tired because of our demanding and hectic ...
do you want to know why adults are so tired all the time ?
because they spend their time obsessing about these stupid , lame things they don' t really have to do .
like cooking .
i mean , have you never heard of takeout ?
and cleaning ?
let' s don' t and say we did !
and quality time with your kids ?
you know what ?
quit bugging ' em !
leave ' em alone !
they like it !
i don' t remember reading any of this in your book .
hello ?
it' s called reading between the lines !
oh , my god .
what ?
that' s my mom .
try listening to the yeah yeah yeahs ,
the vines , the breeders .
and if you' re excited about something , why do you have to hold it in all the time ?
you know , just scream about it !

what are you gonna do ?
god , your mom' s cool .
i can' t hear you !

i' ve gotta get home .
i' ve gotta get home .

i thought your mom didn' t want you on a bike .
you' re a little too virtuous , kid .
you know what ?
i' m late for my second job .
just give me the ride .
i know my mother will understand .
i' m gonna be honest with you .
you seem really different than the person i thought you were .
i saw what you did to stacey' s test .
i think you' re right .
you' re too young for me .
but i don' t know why i did that .
it' s really not like me .
honestly .
good luck , anna .
come on !
they' il let her retake the test !
ohh !
that' s the first time tessie' s work hasn' t put me to sleep .
i might even read one of those books .

new therapeutic technique .
switching points of view .
if i switch with harry , do i have to wear a thong ?
earthquake !
save me !
get back here , you little .
where do i even begin ?
could it be your career killing tv appearance , your nonstop partying with my car and wallet , or , perhaps , my body' s makeover from hell ?
are you listening to a word i' m saying ?
yes .
and get that cheap stud out of my ear .
mom , he is so awesome .
who ?
jake .
please , mommy , can i go out with him ?
please ?
not in ryan' s fiance' s body , you can' t .
what am i supposed to do in ryan' s fiance' s body ?
go to this thing tonight ?
be you ?
that' s today .
what about tomorrow , mom ?
i really don' t want to get married .
i don' t think you' re thrilled about me getting married either , anna .
why ?
why can' t we talk about this ?
what is it about ryan you don' t like ?
he' s fine .
but he' s not your father .
mom , look , i don' t wanna talk about this now .
time' s running out to talk about it .
please , tell me .
mom , do what you want .
marry the dude .
just don' t make me do it .
tess ?
privacy' s a privilege , anna .
tess ?
go .
yo , sup ?
i' m not really a prying kind of guy , but i was wondering what you were doing on the eve of our wedding straddling some guy on the back of a big , black harley .
hello ?
it was a ducati .
is there something you' d like to tell me ?
some fantasy you' re trying to get out of your system ?
because i' d like to know about it now .
i just needed a ride .
i didn' t really even know the guy .
i didn' t know what ...
he' s a friend of mine , ryan .
he likes me .
and my mom wouldn' t let me go out with him , so i just had to beg her to check him out for me .
and she did .
and she actually came to find that he' s a very together young man .
and she approves .
really ?
really .
snap !
uh huh .
so , let' s do this thingy !
you mean our wedding rehearsal ?
yeah , whatever .
excuse me .
ooh !
what are you doing ?
shotgun !
i want to talk to your mom .
are you insane ?
i know i am .
what are you thinking ?
how can you entertain ideas about you and a woman her age ?
what are you talking about ?
she looks great .
really ?
wow .
no !
you have to disappear !
i know it' s unconventional , okay ?
and i know nothing can happen .
i' m not stupid .
i just want to know her .
i want to talk to her .
do not come near my mother or her fianc !
do you understand ?
i don' t understand anything .
for god' s sake , you really need to find someone your own age .
anna , you' re beautiful , okay ?
but you' re not her .
stop it !
promise you' il leave my mother alone .
anna banana !
i' il give you one thing .
i' il give you one thing .
he definitely likes you for your mind .
come on !
come on !
all right , let' s do this .
oh , well , there we go .
oh , i' il have one .
what are you doing ?
nothing .
did you bring it ?
right here .
can you get away ?
well , i' d love to .
it' s just that i' m meeting thousands of 100 year old people .
those are ryan' s parents .
hi .
doesn' t make them any less old .
ryan .
do you think i could borrow my mother for just one minute ?
sure .
ow !
okay , there' s gotta be some clue here .
a journey soon begins , its prize reflected in another' s eyes .
okay , that was the switch .
oh , let me see .
okay , blah , blah .
lack , then selfless love will change you back .
so that means we' re stuck like this forever .
now is not a moment for your negativity .
let' s try to be selfless .
give me your hands .
i' m being selfless .
are you being selfless ?
yeah , i' m being selfless .
you' re not doing a good job .
we' re still here .
oh , right .
so now it' s my fault .
why is everything always ...
it' s jake !
he must' ve followed us .
mom , what' re we gonna do ?
mom ?
mom !
shh !
shh !
don' t scream .
just listen to us .
we are half a block from the house of blues .
tell ' em you' re going to the bathroom , do the song , you' il be back before they know you' ve gone .
i tried to learn your solo , and i suck .
two bands have gone , and they both blew .
we might have a chance if you come .
when i say i can' t , you don' t know the half of it .
don' t make me do this .
what are you doing ?
if ryan sees you here , it will blow everything .
i know .
i' m sorry .
it' s just , when i look into your eyes ...
stop it !
jake , believe me , it is not me you like , it' s anna .
no , you' re the exciting one .
the musical one .
actually , i learned it from her .
i' m tone deaf .
tess ?
shh .
don' t move .
tess ?
oh , found it !
found what ?
my earring .
i thought i lost it .
anna' s friends decided to crash .
you guys !
you know anything about this ?
well , i think they' re trying to get anna to go to an audition which had to be tonight , but i said no .
she had to stay here .
you' re kidding .
no , that' s how it went down .
i know it' s not important to you and that she' s just a girl in a stupid band .
look , dr. coleman , dude , i' m really sorry , but couldn' t we borrow anna for 20 minutes ?
we' d never ask you , or anybody for anything ever again .
i am appalled at you two .
i clearly said ...
go .
what ?
go .
ryan .
what are you still doing here ?
go !
right now !
thank you so much !
i told you he wouldn' t totally ruin your life !
mister dude , you rock !
thanks , mitch .
are you mad ?
no .
do you , like , not want to get married now ?
no .
no , i don' t , not if you' re gonna put me in this role .
what role ?
the role of insensitive stepfather who couldn' t care less or thinks it' s a stupid band , or any of the preposterous things you just said .
how can you say i don' t care ?
i' m not that guy .
if that' s who you think i am , this is never gonna work .
when i fell in love with you , i knew you came with a family , and i respect the hell out of that .
you' ve always put the kids first .
that' s exactly how it should be .
that' s how i want it .
i never pushed anna because i want her to like me on her own terms , in her own way .
wow .
that' s very cool .
yeah .
now , what are you still doing here ?
what do you mean ?
you should be over there .
that' s where you ought to be .
cheering her on .
that' s where i want you to be .
go on .
go .
i can hold down the fort here for 20 minutes .
wish her luck for me .
okay .
whoa , hold it .
oh , you' re not serious .
no !
okay , great .
i' ve got i. d. for once .
thanks .
so , it' s a good crowd out there .
anna , what are you doing ?
what' s wrong ?
i can' t do this .
since when do you get nervous ?
no , i really can' t .
come on , you rock harder than anyone i know .
well , the rocking may be in short supply tonight , girls .
what do you mean ?
i' m just not myself .
anna , i know you' re stressing .
we all are , and i know that maybe it won' t be brilliant , but we' il forgive each other .
we' il find some way to laugh about it .
right now , i just really want us to take this shot , okay ?
we' il still love you , even if it blows .
yeah .
okay , okay , okay , i' il try .
i mean , how hard can it be ?
so don' t forget we changed the chord progression in the first verse from c c d to c d c.
you play notes ?
i mean , i just thought we could play in the key of " rock " !
yeah , okay .
let' s fix your hair .
yeah , what' s with the bun ?
mrs. coleman !
jake , stop !
you' re running away from him .
jake , if you like me at all , you will just leave me alone .
yeah , but ...
please , no !
ladies and gentlemen , please welcome to the stage the next act in the kilsfm wango tango auditions , from right here in los angeles , let' s give it up for pink slip !
do something !
what are you doing ?
i can' t do this !
no , it' s okay .
i unplugged you .
just fake it .
i don' t even know how to do that .
you can' t tell me you never went to a rock concert .
i saw the stones once .
great !
just go out and act like keith !
keith , right , yeah .
richards , mom !
i knew that .
just go act like keith .
act like keith .
not the behavior ?
no , just the playing !
now get out there !
your solo' s coming !
whoo !
anna , you rock !
it' s early , but i think you are definitely in .
all right !
are we in ?
yes !
oh , it was terrifying .
i had no idea what it takes .
the guts .
thanks .
it' s exciting .
your music .
it' s not noise ?
most definitely not noise .
oh , my god !
ryan !
anna ?
my first wedding went like this , you know .
my first wedding went like this , you know .
like what ?
she ran away with the florist .
whole thing went right down the tubes .
don' t make me hurt you .
there she is .
look , look , look .
mom , what' s wrong ?
i have to ask you to do something for me .
sure , whatever .
after what you just did for me , anything .
it needs to happen before the toasts and speeches .
okay .
clearly , we' re not switching back tonight .
i need you to tell ryan you need to postpone the wedding .
what ?
no , listen , i can see you' re not ready for this .
and i can wait .
i guess i was so happy ,
i wasn' t thinking about what' s best for you and harry .
but , mom .
if he loves me like i think he does , he' il wait , too .
he' il understand .
he' il be very sweet and gracious about it .
but please .
just please let him know that i love him .
and be as kind as you possibly can for me .
okay , mom .
i know exactly what to say .
i' il be along in a minute .
you should sit down .
hi .
i guess i' m gonna start the toasts .
so , three years ago , we had a really bad thing happen in our family .
we lost a father and a husband , and i didn' t think we' d ever be able to get over it .
but then ...
this guy next to me came into the picture .
and everybody could see i was happy again .
i was singing in the shower again .
not well , i might add .
but i was still really worried about my kids , anna and harry .
whether they' d be able to accept a new man in their life .
and now i know how anna feels .
and what she feels is that ...
no one could ever take the place of her dad ...
because he was a really great dad .
but somebody could be part of a new family .
its own kind of cool , new , little unit .
and that for someone as special as ryan , that we would all just make a little room .
anna really wanted her mom to know that .
earthquake !
yeah !
and i am so psyched to be here !
i guess all i' m trying to say is , ryan , welcome to our family .
to the bride and groom .
what the hell just happened ?
trust me , you don' t want to know .
thank you for everything .
i love you .
i love you , too .
what ?
go .
go .
hi .
listen , i feel really stupid .
you know , it' s just yesterday was freaky , and , i mean , i see your mom , and i like her .
i mean , not " like her " like her , but , you know , i mean , like her as your mom .
listen , do you think we could just rewind this whole thing and start again ?
i' d like that .
you know , i' ve been thinking about that kiss .
kiss ?
remind me again how i did it .
in front of your mom ?
it' s okay .
she owes me .
hey , why don' t you ask that girl to dance ?
no way !
come on , go on over there .
stop bugging me .
boy , it' s true .
youth is wasted on the young .
you go ask her , you old fart .
now , wait a minute !
why , if i was your age , oh !
cookie ?
well , why , yes , i don' t mind if i do .
mama !
what are you doing ?
mama !
