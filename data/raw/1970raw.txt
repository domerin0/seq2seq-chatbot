there are some fish that cannot be caught .
it' s not that they' re faster or stronger than other fish .
they' re just touched by something extra .
one such fish was the beast .
and by the time i was born he was already a legend .
he' d passed up more $ 1 00 lures than any fish in alabama .
some said that fish was the ghost of a thief ... ... who' d drowned in that river 60 years before .
others claimed he was a dinosaur left over from the " cruaceous " period .
i didn' t put any stock into such speculation or superstition .
all i knew was i' d been trying to catch that fish ... ... since i was a boy no bigger than you .
and on the day you were born ....
well , that was the day i finally caught him .
worms , lures , peanut butter , peanut butter and cheese .
if that fish was henry walls ' ghost , then the usual bait wasn' t gonna work .
i was gonna have to use something he truly desired .
your finger ?
gold .
now , i tied my ring onto the strongest line they made ... ... strong enough to hold up a bridge , they said , if only for a few minutes .
and then i cast upriver .
the beast jumped up and grabbed it before it even hit the water .
and just as fast , he snapped clean through that line .
well , you can see my predicament .
my wedding ring , the symbol of fidelity to my wife ...
... soon to be mother of my child ...
make him stop . ... was now lost in the gut of an uncatchable fish .
what did you do ?
i followed that fish upriver and downriver .
this fish , the beast ... ... the whole time we were calling it a him , when in fact it was a her .
it was fat with eggs it was gonna lay any day .
now , i was in a situation .
i could gut that fish and get my wedding ring back ... ... but in doing so i' d be killing the smartest catfish in the ashton river .
did i want to deprive my son the chance ... ... to catch a fish like this of his own ?
this ladyfish and i ....
well , we had the same destiny .
" we were part of the same equation .
now , you may well ask ...
oh , darling , darling , it' s still your night . ... why did it strike so quick on gold when nothing else would attract it ?
that was the lesson i learned that day ... ... the day my son was born .
sometimes the only way to catch an uncatchable woman ... ... is to offer her a wedding ring .
what , a father' s not allowed to talk about his son ?
i' m a footnote in that story , dad ... ... the context for your great adventure , which never happened , incidentally .
you were selling novelty products in wichita when i was born .
come on , will .
everyone loves that story ! .
they don' t .
i don' t love that story .
not anymore .
not after a thousand times ! .
i know every punch line , dad .
i can tell them as well as you can !
for one night , one night in your entire life ... ... the universe did not revolve around edward bloom .
how can you not understand that ?
i' m sorry to embarrass you .
you' re embarrassing yourself , dad .
you just don' t see it .
after that night , i didn' t speak to my father again for three years .
william bloom , united press lnternational .
if i could just
we communicated indirectly , i guess .
in her letters and christmas cards , my mother wrote for both of them .
and when i' d call , she' d say dad was out driving or swimming in the pool .
true to form , we never talked about not talking .
the truth is , i didn' t see anything of myself in my father .
and i don' t think he saw anything of himself in me .
we were like strangers who knew each other very well .
in telling the story of my father' s life ... ... it' s impossible to separate fact from fiction , the man from the myth .
the best i can do is to tell it the way he told me .
it doesn' t always make sense , and most of it never happened .
give me back my ring !
thank you !
but that' s what kind of story this is .
his birth would set the pace for his unlikely life .
no longer than most men' s , but larger .
and as strange as his stories got ... ... the endings were always the most surprising of all .
yes .
yes , he' s here .
it' s your mother .
and what does dr. bennett say ?
no , sure , i' il talk to him .
yeah , i' il wait .
it' s bad ?
yeah , it' s more than they thought .
they' re gonna stop chemo .
you need to go .
probably tonight .
i' m going with you .
no , no , no .
you shouldn' t .
i' m going with you .
now , which one' s it gonna be ?
monkey in a barn , " or " dog in the road " ?
the one about the witch .
the one about the witch .
ii
you get nightmares .
but i' m not scared .
well , neither was i , at first .
now , this took place in the swamp outside of ashton .
children weren' t allowed in the swamp on account of the snakes , spiders ... ... and quicksand that would swallow you up before you could even scream .
me , ruthie , wilbur freely ... ... and the price brothers , don and zacky .
and not one of us knew what was in store .
it' s common knowledge that most towns of a certain size have a witch ... ... if only to eat misbehaving children ... ... and the occasional puppy who wanders into her yard .
witches use those bones to cast spells and curses ... ... and make the land infertile .
ls it true she got a glass eye ?
i heard she got it from gypsies .
what' s a gypsy ?
your momma' s a gypsy .
your momma' s a bitch .
you shouldn' t swear .
there' s ladies present .
shit .
damn .
screw .
turn off your flashlights .
she' il see you !
yet of all the witches in alabama ... ... there was one who was said to be the most feared .
for she had one glass eye which was said to contain mystical powers .
i heard if you look right at it , you' il see how you' re gonna die .
that' s bull s h l t , that is .
she' s not even a real witch .
if you' re so sure , go get that eye .
i heard she keeps it in a box on her night table .
or are you too scared ?
i' il go in right now and get that eye .
then do it .
fine , i will .
fine , you do it .
fine , i' m doing it .
edward , don' t !
she' il make soap out of you .
that' s what she does .
she makes soap out of people .
ma' am , my name is edward bloom ... ... and there' s some folks like to see your eye .
you get the eye ?
i brought it .
let' s see it .
whoa , help !
i saw how i was gonna die .
i was old and i fell .
i wasn' t old at all .
i was thinking about death and all .
about seeing how you' re gonna die .
i mean , on one hand , if dying was all you thought about ... ... it could kind of screw you up .
but it could kind of help you , couldn' t it ?
because , everything else , you' d know you could survive .
i guess i' m saying i' d like to know .
that' s how i go .
hi , mom .
ls that dr. bennett' s car ?
yes .
he' s up with your father now .
and how is he ?
well no , i got it .
he' s impossible .
he won' t eat .
because he doesn' t eat , he' s weaker .
because he' s weak , he doesn' t want to eat .
how much time does he have left ?
you don' t talk about that .
not yet .
will .
dr. bennett .
oh , it' s good to see you .
my wife , josephine .
a pleasure .
you' re seven months .
to the day !
it' s a boy .
try to get him to drink one of these .
he won' t , but go ahead and try .
dad ?
ii
you want some water ?
you are in for a surprise .
am l ?
having a kid changes everything .
there' s the diapers and the burping and the midnight feeding .
did you do any of that ?
no .
but i hear it' s terrible .
then you spend years trying to corrupt and mislead this child ... ... fill its head with nonsense , and still it turns out perfectly fine .
you think i' m up for it ?
you learned from the best .
drink half the can .
i' il tell mom you drank it all .
everyone wins .
people needn' t worry so much .
it' s not my time yet .
this is not how i go .
really ?
truly .
i saw it in the eye .
the old lady by the swamp ?
she was a witch .
no , she was old and probably senile .
i saw my death in that eye , and this isn' t how it happens .
so how does it happen ?
surprise ending .
wouldn' t want to ruin it for you .
your mother thought we wouldn' t talk again .
look at us .
we' re talking fine .
we' re storytellers , both of us .
i speak mine out , you write yours down .
same thing .
dad ....
i hope to talk about some things while i' m here .
you mean while i' m here .
events .
stories .
you .
your mother hasn' t been keeping up the pool .
lf you wanted to , you could fix it .
yeah , i will .
you know where the chemicals are ?
i did it when you were gone .
i was never much for being at home , will .
too confining .
and this here , being stuck in bed ....
dying is the worst thing that' s ever happened to me .
i thought you said you weren' t dying .
i said this isn' t how i go .
the last part is much more unusual .
trust me on that .
dr. bennett said i have to stay at home for a week .
oh , that' s nothing .
once , i had to stay in bed for three years .
did you have the chickenpox ?
i wish .
truth is , no one quite knew what was wrong .
most times a person grows up gradually ... ... while i found myself in a hurry .
my muscles and my bones couldn' t keep up with my body' s ambition .
so i spent the better part of three years confined to my bed ... ... with the encyclopedia being my only means of exploration .
i had made it all the way to the g' s ... ... hoping to find an answer to my " gigantificationism " ... ... when i uncovered an article about the common goldfish .
kept in a small bowl , the goldfish will remain small .
with more space ... ... the fish will grow double , triple , or quadruple its size .
it occurred to me then that perhaps the reason for my growth ... ... was that i was intended for larger things .
after all , a giant man can' t have an ordinary sized life .
as soon as my bones had settled in their adult configuration ... ... i set upon my plan to make a bigger place for myself in ashton .
tigers , go !
edward bloom !
doggy !
my doggy !
my doggy' s trapped !
i was the biggest thing ashton had ever seen .
until one day , a stranger arrived .
calm down .
calm down , everybody .
calm down .
that' s enough .
mr. mayor , he ate an entire corn field .
he ate my dog .
if you ain' t gonna stop him , mayor , we will .
i won' t have mob violence in this town .
now , has someone tried talking to him ?
you can' t reason with him .
he' s a monster .
i' il do it .
i' il talk to him .
see if i can get him to go .
that creature could crush you without trying .
oh , trust me , he' il have to try .
hello ?
my name is edward bloom , and i wanna talk to you !
go away !
now , i' m not going anywhere until you show yourself !
i said , go away !
armed with the foreknowledge of my own death ... ... i knew the giant couldn' t kill me .
all the same , i preferred to keep my bones unbroken .
why are you here ?
so you can eat me .
the town decided to send a human sacrifice and i volunteered .
my arms are a little stringy , but there' s some good eating in my legs .
i mean , i' d be tempted to eat them myself .
so i guess , well ....
if you' d just get it over with quick , because i' m not much for pain , really .
oh , come on !
i can' t go back !
i' m a human sacrifice !
if i go back , they' il think i' m a coward .
i' d rather be dinner than a coward .
here .
you can start with my hand .
it' il be an appetizer .
i don' t want to eat you .
i don' t want to eat anybody .
i just get so hungry .
i' m just too big .
did you ever think that maybe you' re not too big ... ... but maybe this town is just too small ?
i' ve heard in real cities there are buildings so tall ... ... you can' t even see the tops of them .
really ?
oh , i wouldn' t lie to you .
and all you can eat buffets .
now , you can eat a lot , can' t you ?
i can .
so why are you wasting your time in a small town ?
you' re a big man .
you should be in a big city .
you' re just trying to get me to leave , aren' t you ?
what' s your name , giant ?
karl .
well , mine' s edward .
and truthfully ....
well , i do want you to leave , karl .
but i want to leave with you .
i mean , you think this town is too small for you ?
well , it' s too small for a man of my ambition .
so , what do you say ?
join me ?
okay .
okay .
now , first , we gotta get you ready for the city .
edward bloom , first son of ashton ... ... it' s with a heavy heart that we see you go .
but take with you this key to the city ... ... and know that any time you want to come back ... ... all our doors are open to you .
that afternoon as i left ashton , everyone seemed to have advice .
find yourself a nice girl , now !
watch your pride , edward bloom !
but there was one person whose counsel i held above all others .
she said that the biggest fish in the river ... ... gets that way by never being caught .
what' d she say ?
beats me .
ii
a new one which was paved and an older one that wasn' t .
people didn' t use the old one anymore ... ... and it had developed a reputation for being haunted .
well , since i had no intention of ever returning to ashton ... ... this seemed as good a time as any to find out what lay down that old one .
you know anyone who' s taken it ?
that poet , norther winslow , did .
he was going to paris , france .
i guess he liked it .
no one ever heard from him again .
i' il tell you what .
you go the other way .
i' il cut through here , and i' il meet you on the far side .
you' re just trying to run away , aren' t you ?
here .
just to be sure , you can take my pack .
why , you son of a
now , there comes a point when a reasonable man ... ... will swallow his pride and admit that he' s made a terrible mistake .
the truth is , i was never a reasonable man .
and what i recall of sunday school was that ... ... the more difficult something is , the more rewarding it is in the end .
friend !
welcome to you !
what' s your name ?
edward bloom .
" bloom " like a flower ?
yes .
oh , here !
here you are , right here .
edward bloom .
we weren' t expecting you yet .
you were expecting me ?
not yet .
you must' ve taken a shortcut .
why , yes , i did .
it almost killed me .
life will do that to you .
and truthfully , the long way is easier .
but it' s longer .
much longer .
and you' re here now , and that' s what matters .
what is this place ?
the town of spectre .
best kept secret in alabama !
now , it says here you' re from ashton , right ?
last person we had from ashton was norther winslow .
the poet ?
whatever happened to him ?
he' s still here .
let me buy you a drink .
i' il tell you all about it .
hell , i' il have him tell you !
i have to meet somebody , and i' m already running late .
now , son , i already told you .
you' re early .
now , tell me if that isn' t the best pie you ever ate .
it truly is .
well , everything tastes better here .
even the water is sweet .
never gets too hot , too cold , too humid .
at night , the wind goes through the trees where you' d swear ... ... there was a whole symphony out there playing just for you .
hey !
jenny !
come back here !
jenny !
hey , i need those .
there is no softer ground than town .
that almost rhymes .
he' s our poet laureate .
come on .
i agreed to spend the afternoon , if only to understand ... ... the mystery of how a place could feel so strange and yet so familiar .
i' ve been working on this poem for 1 2 years .
really ?
there' s a lot of expectation .
i don' t wanna disappoint my fans .
may l ?
it' s only three lines long .
this is why you should never show a work in progress .
i got him !
there' s leeches in there .
did you see that woman ?
what did she look like ?
well , she was ....
was she naked ?
yes , she was .
it' s not a woman .
it' s a fish .
no one ever catches her .
fish looks different to different people .
my daddy said it looked like the coon dog he had when he was a kid ... ... back from the dead .
oh , darn .
how old are you ?
eighteen .
i' m 8 .
that means when i' m 1 8 , you' il be 28 .
and when i' m 28 , you' il only be 38 .
you' re pretty good at arithmetic .
and when i' m 38 , you' il be 48 .
that' s not much difference at all .
sure is a lot now , though , huh ?
hey , edward !
ii
ii
i love spectre ....
excuse me .
jenny thinks you' re quite a catch .
we all do .
what ?
i said , you' re quite a catch .
i have to leave .
tonight .
why ?
this town is more than any man could ask for .
and if i were to end up here , i would consider myself lucky .
but the truth is , i' m just not ready to end up anywhere .
but no one' s ever left .
how are you gonna make it without your shoes ?
well , i suspect it will hurt .
a lot .
now , i' m sorry , but ....
well , goodbye .
you won' t find a better place .
i don' t expect to .
promise me you' il come back .
i promise .
someday .
when i' m really supposed to .
that night , i reached two conclusions .
the first was that a dangerous path is made much worse by darkness .
the second was that i was hopelessly and irrevocably lost .
these woods would become my graveyard .
as difficult as it was to reach spectre , i was fated to get there eventually .
after all , no man can avoid reaching the end of his life .
and then i realized this wasn' t the end of my life .
this isn' t how i die .
friend .
what happened to your shoes ?
they kind of got ahead of me .
i don' t know if you saw it , but josephine had some photos ... ... in the most recent newsweek .
really ?
that' s just wonderful .
i spent a week in morocco for the story .
it was incredible .
oh .
we' il have to pick up a copy .
i don' t know if you' re aware of this , josephine ... ... but african parrots , in their native congo , they speak only french .
really ?
you' re lucky to get four words out of them in english .
but if you were to walk through the jungle ... ... you' d hear them speaking the most elaborate french .
those parrots talk about everything .
politics , movies , fashion .
everything but religion .
why not religion , dad ?
it' s rude to talk about religion .
you never know who you' re gonna offend .
josephine actually went to the congo last year .
oh , so you know .
hello .
hi .
how are you feeling ?
oh , i was dreaming .
what were you dreaming about ?
oh , i don' t usually remember ... ... unless they' re especially portentous .
do you know what that word means ?
it means when you dream about something that' s gonna happen .
your aunt is gonna die .
i was so scared , i woke up my parents ... ... but they said it was just a dream and to get back to bed .
but the next morning , my aunt stacy was dead .
that' s terrible .
terrible for her , but think about me , young boy with that kind of power .
wasn' t three weeks later when the crow came back to me in a dream ... ... and said , " your daddy' s gonna die .
i didn' t know what to do .
oh , not to worry .
but i could see he was rattled .
the next morning , he wasn' t himself .
kept looking around , waiting for something to drop on his head .
your daddy' s gonna die .
well , he left home early and was gone a long time .
when he finally came back , he looked terrible ... ... iike he was waiting for the ax to fall all day .
i' ve just had the worst day of my life .
you think you' ve had a bad day ? " she said .
this morning , the milkman dropped dead on the porch .
because , see , my mother was banging the milkman .
can i take your picture ?
oh , you don' t need a picture .
just look up the word " handsome " in the dictionary .
please ?
all right .
i have photos of the wedding to show you .
there is a great one of you and my father .
i want to see pictures of your wedding .
i' ve never seen any .
that' s because we didn' t have a proper wedding .
your mother in law was never supposed to marry me .
she was engaged to somebody else .
i never knew .
will never told you ?
probably just as well .
he would have told it wrong , anyway .
all the facts , none of the flavor .
oh .
so this is a tall tale .
well , it' s not a short one .
ii
i' d just left spectre and was on my way to discover my destiny .
i' d just left spectre and was on my way to discover my destiny .
i' d just left spectre and was on my way to discover my destiny .
not knowing what that would be exactly ... ... i explored every opportunity that presented itself .
coco !
coco !
there they are .
ladies and gentlemen !
you may think you' ve seen the unusual .
you may think you' ve seen the bizarre .
but i' ve traveled to the five corners of the world ... ... and let me tell you , i' ve never seen anything like this !
when i met this man ... ... he was picking oranges in florida .
his fellow workers called him el penumbra .
the shadow .
because when you worked beside him ... ... he blocked out the daylight !
not to alarm you , ma' am , but if this man wanted to ... ... he could crush your head between his toes ... ... iike a tiny walnut .
but he won' t do it .
no .
no , ladies and gentlemen ... ... he will not hurt her ... ... because he is our own gentle giant .
ladies and gentlemen , i give you colossus !
ladies and gentlemen , boys and girls ... ... thank y' all for coming .
drive home safely , everyone .
thank you for coming .
it was on that night karl met his destiny .
and i met mine , almost .
they say when you meet the love of your life , time stops .
and that' s true .
what they don' t tell you is that once time starts again ... ... it moves extra fast to catch up .
what' s your name ?
it' s karl .
karl .
t ell me , karl , have you ever heard the term " involuntary servitude " ?
no .
" unconscionable contract " ?
nope .
great .
here you go .
here you are .
mr. soggybottom , come down this here ... ... so he can use your back to sign on it .
okay .
thank you .
yeah .
hey , kid .
your friend just made himself a star .
oh , that' s great .
my attorney , mr. soggybottom .
good to meet you .
pleased to meet you .
what' s the matter ?
i haven' t seen a customer so depressed ... ... since the elephant sat on that farmer' s wife .
depressed " ?
see ?
the big guy likes it .
i just saw the woman i' m gonna marry .
i know it .
but i lost her .
oh , tough break .
well , most men have to get married before they lose their wives .
i' m gonna spend the rest of my life looking for her .
that or die alone .
damn , kid .
let me guess .
real pretty ?
reddish blondish hair ?
blue dress ?
yeah !
i know her uncle .
friends of the family .
who is she ?
where does she live ?
forget it .
don' t waste your time .
she' s out of your league .
what ?
you don' t even know me .
sure i do .
you were hot shit back in hickville , but here in the real world , you got squat .
you don' t have a plan or a job .
nothing except the clothes on your back .
well , i have a whole backpack full of clothes .
oh , someone stole my backpack .
you were a big fish in a small pond , but this here is the ocean ... ... and you' re drowning .
go back to puddleville .
you' il be happy there .
you say i don' t have a plan .
i do .
i' il find that girl , marry her , and spend the rest of my life with her .
i don' t have a job , but i would have a job if you gave me one .
and i may not have much ... ... but i have more determination than any man you' re likely to meet .
i' m sorry , kid .
i don' t do charity .
come on , big boy .
wait .
look , i' il work night and day for you ... ... and you won' t have to pay me .
you just have to tell me who she is .
every month you work for me ... ... i' il tell you one thing about her .
that' s my final offer .
let' s get started .
from that moment on , i did everything mr. calloway asked .
i' d go three days without stopping to eat .
and four days without sleeping .
what kept me going was the promise of meeting the girl ... ... who would be my wife .
stick together , that' s the way it' s gonna be .
the way it was , and the way it will be .
mr. calloway , sir ?
it' s been a month today .
this girl , the love of your life ... ... her favorite flowers are daffodils .
so get that stuff ....
daffodils .
daffodils .
daffodils .
true to his word ... ... every month amos would tell me something new ... ... about the woman of my dreams .
enjoy yourselves , enjoy yourselves .
she' s going to college .
college .
she' s going to college .
she likes music .
music .
she likes music .
over the months , i learned a lot about the woman i would marry ...
over the months , i learned a lot about the woman i would marry ... ... but not her name , and not where to find her .
that time had come .
i couldn' t wait any longer .
mr. calloway ?
it' s edward bloom .
i need to talk to you .
mr. calloway ?
no .
wait !
that night , i discovered that most things you consider evil or wicked ... ... are simply lonely and lacking in social niceties .
didn' t kill anything , did l ?
a few rabbits .
but i think one of them was already dead .
that would explain the indigestion .
thank you .
i was wrong about you , kid .
you may not have much , but what you got , you got a lot of .
you could get any girl .
there' s only one i want .
her name ...
... is sandra templeton .
she goes to auburn .
semester' s almost over , so you better hurry .
thank you .
thank you .
good luck , kid !
thank you , sir !
bye , now .
bye , edward .
after saying my goodbyes , i hopped three trains ... ... to get to auburn that afternoon .
you don' t know me , but my name is edward bloom ... ... and i love you .
i' ve spent the last three years working to find out who you are .
i' ve been shot , stabbed , and trampled a few times .
i broke my ribs twice .
but it' s all been worth it to see you here now ... ... and to finally get to talk to you .
because i' m destined to marry you .
i knew it when i saw you at the circus , and i know it now more than ever .
i' m sorry .
you don' t have to apologize to me .
i' m the luckiest person you' il find today .
no , i' m sorry i' m engaged to be married .
but you' re wrong .
i do know you .
at least by reputation .
edward bloom from ashton .
see , i' m actually engaged to a boy from ashton .
don price .
he was a few years older than you .
well ....
congratulations .
i' m sorry to have bothered you .
stop it !
it' s not funny .
that poor boy .
fate has a cruel way of circling around on you .
after all this work to leave ashton ... ... the girl i love was now engaged to one of its biggest jerks .
there' s a time when a man needs to fight ... ... and a time when he needs to accept that his destiny' s lost ... ... the ship has sailed , and that only a fool will continue .
truth is , i' ve always been a fool .
sandra t empleton , i love you , and i will marry you !
so as you can see , if we apply these rules to our everyday life ...
... supply and demand makes much more sense .
take a look at the next graph , and the import of this will be even stronger
for three hours .
look !
