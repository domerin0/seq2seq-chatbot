risin ' up
back on the street
did my time , took my chances
went the distance , now i' m back on my feet
just a man and his will to survive
so many times , it happens too fast
you change your passion for glory
don' t lose your grip on the dreams ofthe past
you must fightjust to keep them alive
it' s the eye ofthe tiger , it' s the thrill ofthe fight
risin ' up to the challenge ofour rival
and the last known survivor stalks his prey in the night
and he' s watchin ' us all in the eye ofthe tiger
come on !
we made a deal .
i know , but it' s extremely crazy .
it' s mentally irregular , but it makes all the sense in the world .
you owe me a favour .
i know , but ...
when did you think of this ?
about three years ago .
this is very crazy , apollo .
stallion , when you won that last fight , you won by one second .
you beat me by one second .
that' s very hard for a man of my intelligence to handle .
didn' t you say you learned how to live with it ?
i lied .
oh , you lied ?
oh !
so now you just gotta prove it to yourself , right ?
just for myself .
no tv , no newspapers just you and me .
nothin ' just you and me .
age before beauty .
anything you say .
i do all the work .
ok .
i tell you , apollo , you' d better go slow .
you ain' t as young as springtime no more .
i' m still young enough to whip your butt .
oh , yeah ?
how you gonna do that ?
you taught me everything you know .
almost everything .
you gotta remember : you fight great , but i' m a great fighter .
you ready ?
absolutely .
you know , stallion , it' s too bad we gotta get old , huh ?
oh , just keep punchin ' , apollo .
wanna ring the bell ?
all right .
ding , ding .
come on , stallion .
come on , come on .
boy , you really move good for an older guy .
look at him fly .

dad , you' re late .
mom' s gonna yell at you .

you know , don' t you think that' s a little bright ?
a little bit ?
where' d you get that hat ?
a friend gave it to me .

who punched you in the eye ?
same friend .
that' s weird .
better hurry , dad .
you know , you' re developin ' a very , very loud personality .

the guy i bought it from says even if it looks like a snake , don' t worry , cos it won' t bite you .
it' s beautiful .
you know what' s amazing ?
that after all these years , everything still seems kinda new .
you remember a long time ago i told you that ...
i said that you ain' t never gettin ' rid of me .
remember that ?
well , you' re not .
you' re never gettin ' rid of me .
happy " almost anniversary " .
a few questions , please .
how long are you here for ?
we talk later .
when are you gonna fight , drago ?
we talk later .
is it definite that the soviet union will enter professional boxing ?
no more talk now .
we will talk at press conference .
oh , golden dishes from church' s and catfish at church' s
have some catfish from church' s fried chicken
catfish from church' s !
today may be a landmark in sports history .
after unravelling years ofred tape , russia will throw its hat into the ring the prize ring .
the introductions were made by his wife , ludmilla vobet drago gold medallist in swimming .
today the soviet union has officially entered professional boxing .
my husband and great undefeated heavyweight world amateur champion ,
captain lvan drago , has come here with his trainers to america to compete as an international sportsman and ambassador ofgoodwill .
has he boxed against a professional ?
from having been trained in russia by great boxing coach manuel vega , and now by sergei rimsky , we hope he' s qualified to do so .
hope ?
well , i know he is , but i don' t want to sound too confident .
we would like an exhibition bout with your famous champion , rocky balboa .
you think he can fight someone as seasoned as balboa ?
there is no one who can match his strength , endurance or aggressiveness .
you make him sound indestructible .
yes , he is .
can this mammoth russian , nicknamed the siberian express , wreak havoc among the professional heavyweight ranks ?
whoever he fights first , it' il be one hot ticket .
we' il be right back with a check on today' s pro football sports scoreboard .
dad , when can i learn to fight ?
i can' t hear you .
what ?
i wanna learn to fight .
yo .
could you turn your robot down ?
you see , i fight so you don' t have to fight .
i want you to use your head for somethin ' instead of a punchin ' bag , like i do .
your head doesn' t look like a punching bag .
no ?
that' s nice .
thanks a lot .
it looks like a catcher' s mitt !
oh !
a wise guy , huh ?
mr balboa !
mr creed' s on the phone .
yeah ?
i' il be right there .
you can get it right here .
i hope it' s not another rematch .
oh , don' t worry about it .
hello ?
yeah , apollo ...
turn that down .
apollo , how ya doin ' ?
yeah ?
you' re comin ' out ?
that' s great .
what am i doin ' ?
i' m just gettin ' dizzy .
my husband and i thank you for coming to our training quarter today .
as you can see , it is highly advanced , and we wish to show the american press a small portion of the advances our country has made in the technology of human performance .
coach rimsky , what does this do to enhance performance ?
well ...
if i may answer .
it makes a man a better man , a great athlete a superathlete , by harnessing all his strength .
though most of the world is ignorant in body chemistry ,
we wish to ... educate your country .
there have been rumours of doping , and widespread distribution of anabolic steroids in the soviet union .
has drago partaken in any experiments ?
no ! lvan is naturally trained .
then how do you explain his ... freakish strength ?
like your popeye , he ate his spinach every day .
shall we have a demonstration ?
please do .
a normal heavyweight averages 700 pounds of pressure per square inch .
as you can see , drago averages 1850 pounds .
so the result' s quite obvious .
and what results are those ?
whatever he hits , he destroys .
i' ve seen drago fight when he was an amateur .
he' s big and strong , but clumsy .
i know i can beat him .
why do you wanna fight again ?
let' s just say it' s somethin ' i believe in .
you can do your homework .
ok .
later , dad .
later , uncle paulie .
later , apollo .
later , big man .
see you later , kiddo .
don' t you think people are expectin '
to see rocky whack this bum out first ?
yeah .
and he will , when it' s for real .
this is an exhibition bout .
kids ' stuff .
what' s the purpose ?
what at this point in your life is worth getting hurt for ?
double or nothin ' , you' ve gotta have a partner ...
what the hell is that ?
that' s my girl .
takin ' and givin ' , it' s time we started livin ' ...
thanks , honey .
you' re welcome .
that' s a nice song .
it' s my favourite .
you' re the greatest .
see you , sport .
see you .
paulie , who taught it to talk like that ?
she loves me .
you stepped out ofthe night ...
like i was sayin ' , i don' t want this chump to come over here with all that hype , tryin ' to make us look bad .
they try every other way .
with rock' s help , we can get great media coverage .
we make them look bad .
i think it' s wrong .
no .
it' s never been more right .
you' re a great fighter , but you' ve been retired five years .
isn' t it time to start thinking about something else ?
how much can you take ?
either of you ?
i' il ... get the coffee .
look , i' m sorry .
i didn' t mean to ...
i just care about you both .
i ...
you ever try these comics ?
no , no .
keeps your fertility .
hey , paulie .
in the ring now ...
rocky' s holding that right hand .
he' s fighting right handed !
oh , now this was a great fight .
great !
i' m gettin ' punchy just watchin ' it !
mamma mia !
what you usin ' for a chin there , stallion ?
i should' ve slipped that one .
you definitely should' ve slipped that .
it' s crazy how people just care about you in that ring and when you' re bleedin ' , but once you step out , you' re ancient history .
it ain' t ancient history .
i don' t see anybody askin ' for autographs , do you ?
hey , apollo ...
can i ... ask you somethin ' ?
what ?
well , this fight you' re havin ' against the russian .
do you think maybe ... it ain' t against him ?
if it' s not him , stallion , then who' s it against ?
well , do you think maybe it' s , like ... you against you ?
what do you think ?
you know , i think you really are gettin ' brain damaged .
maybe , but ... really .
i' m speakin ' the truth here , apollo .
are you ?
yeah .
i don' t think i wanna hear this , stallion .
hey , apollo , you were a great fighter , but , look , we gotta face the facts too .
you don' t wanna believe it , but maybe the show is over .
that' s easy for you to say .
you' re still on top .
what happens when you' re not on top ?
then what ?
where do we go , stallion ?
cos we sure as hell can' t be born again .
i know we can' t be born again , but , let' s face it , we ... we gotta change sometime .
i don' t wanna change !
i like who i am !
i like who you are , too , but look at that .
that ain' t us up there no more , apollo .
we can' t do that the way we did it before .
we' re changin ' .
we' re , like , turnin ' into regular people .
no , stallion !
maybe you think you' re changin ' .
but you can' t change what you really are .
you can forget all this money and stuff .
cos it don' t change a thing .
you and me , we don' t even have a choice .
we' re born with a killer instinct that you can' t just turn off and on like some radio .
we have to be right in the middle of the action , cos we' re the warriors .
without some challenge , some damn war to fight , then the warrior may as well be dead , stallion .
so i' m askin ' you , as a friend ,
stand by my side this one last time .
you' re a great talker , apollo .
all right , but ... when this is over ... ?
you know me , stallion .
i always think of somethin ' else .
that' s what i' m afraid of .
all right .
you got a deal there .
i feel sorry for that guy , you know ?
what made you decide to put on an exhibition fight with drago ?
let' s call it a sense of responsibility .
responsibility , how ?
i had to teach this young fella to box american style !
isn' t drago a little inexperienced to be in the same ring ?
well , you know , some folks got to learn the hard way !
no quick knockout predictions ?
no .
i' m not angry with him .
i just wanna show the whole world that russia doesn' t have all the best athletes .
rocky , how do you think apollo should fight drago ?
well , personally , i think the first thing you' d better get apollo is a ladder .
drago , how does it feel to spar with the great former champion ?
the man' s tongue didn' t come through customs .
my husband is very happy to have this opportunity .
it' s his dream .
dream ?
how do you mean ?
in our country , apollo creed is well known and very respected .
it could be a good victory .
whoa !
wait a minute , now .
hold it .
when ?
now you don' t really think you' re gonna whip me , do ya ?
well , he didn' t come here to lose .
you hold on , little lady .
lose , and lose royally , he' s gonna do .
how can you be so sure ?
i' ve been with the best .
i beat the best .
i retired more men than social security !
excuse , please .
you are not very realistic , are you , mr creed ?
what are you talkin ' about ?
you can box , yes , but you are far too old to think you can win over drago .
is that a fact ?
yes !
and it could be a painful one !
put that heavy bag with eyeballs in the ring with me and you' il see pain !
why do you insult us ?
now you just hold on here .
i' m not the bad guy .
i came to talk about a friendly exhibition bout
till comrade bigmouth started up !
it is you who are the aggressor .
i wish to say to the press , in all fairness ,
drago should not even fight this man , because he is a has been .
you get that big chump in the ring right now ...
stop this before you get hurt .
i don' t wanna hear !
let that chump go !
all right , all right .
i' ve said what i feel .
we' il finish this in the ring !
wherever you like .
you shut up , and all these puppets you brought with you !
you' re history , chump !
how did i do ?
a little loud for me .
but good ?
oh , yeah .
very good .
east meets west .
age versus youth in a goodwill exhibition match , as the former champion apollo creed takes on a mountain ofmuscle from the soviet union . : lvan drago .
come on .
patience is a virtue .
i' m ready to rock ' n ' roll .
you gotta get your equipment .
now you look like a mummy .
i feel like a mummy .
how does it feel ?
ok ?
feels great .
i feel like i could eat nails .
i never tried them snails .
what are you talkin ' about ?
snails .
i never had ' em .
i see ' em in the garden , but i never want to eat ' em .
i didn' t say anythin ' about snails .
i said nails .
n n nails , stallion !
you look pretty good , but , you know , just do me a favour when you go up there .
try not to wear yourself out , ok ?
yeah , wear myself out .
sure .
well , it' s just that you ain' t been in the ring for five years .
i just want you to ... maintain a little bit .
i' m in the best shape of my life .
i' m stronger , i' m quicker ...
hey , i' m not sayin ' you' re not ready , but personally , if it were me ,
i wouldn' t mind postponin ' a couple of weeks .
postpone ?
come on , apollo .
we don' t know anythin ' about this guy you' re fightin ' , really .
let' s say i postpone .
i pull out , somebody else steps in and whips this chump .
then where does that leave me ?
this is just some kind of exhibition fight .
this thing don' t mean nothin ' .
no , man .
that' s where you' re wrong .
this is not just an exhibition fight that doesn' t mean anything .
this is us against them .
what are you talkin ' about ?
come on !
stallion ...
maybe you don' t know what i' m talkin ' about now , but you will when it' s over .
believe me , you will when it' s over .
ivan !
good luck .
i hope after we can be friends .
i hope so .
of course .
they' re sportsmen , not soldiers .
enjoy the fight .
ow !
get up !
knock it out !
dig !
hit it !
hit it !
superhighways
coast to coast
easy to get anywhere
on the transcontinental overload
just slide behind the wheel
how does it feel ?
when there' s no destination
that' s too far
and somewhere on the way you might find out who you are , wow !
livin ' in america
eye to eye
station to station
livin ' in america
hand to hand , across the nation
livin ' in america

good evening .
along with warner wolf , i am stu nahan .
we welcome you to an unusual event : for the first time ever ,
west against east in professional sports .
thanks for gettin ' me here .
i owe you one .
oh , no , no .
we' re even .
god , i feel born again .
ladies and gentlemen , welcome !
i would like to announce the presence of a true fighting champion that defines the word " courage " .
rocky balboa !
excuse me , would you ?
certainly .
rocky !
tonight' s special event features two great athletes .
in the blue corner , weighing 221 pounds , a former heavyweight champion of the world , the dancing destroyer , the king of sting , the count of monte fisto ...
think you got enough names ?
be patient .
almost done .
the master of disaster , the one and only apollo creed !
the crowd anticipating a great fight now as apollo plays to the crowd .
in the red corner , weighing an even 261 pounds , gold medallist and undefeated world amateur champion from the soviet union , the siberian bull ,
ivan drago !
i want you !
i want you !
i want you !
the two fighters come to the centre for instructions from referee lou filippo .
you know the rules .
watch the low blows , kidney punches and rabbit punches .
in case of a knockdown , go to the corner and stay there until i tell you to come out .
shake hands .
let' s have a good fight .
it' s time to go to school , son .
get your hands up !
do you need an interpreter ?
it' s time to go to school !
you will lose .
all right !
the bad blood between these two can be felt all over this arena .
i can' t get over the size of this russian !
apollo !
apollo !
get ready , cos it' s showtime !
showtime !
it' s showtime !
excuse me .
didn' t you forget somethin ' ?
apollo seems to be in great spirits .
he' s really putting on a show for this capacity crowd .
be back in a minute , all right ?
round one .
creed' s dancing around .
creed back pedalling now .
he' s been away five years .
neither fighter ready to throw a punch .
a left jab there ... and once again .
a slip by creed .
this is bizarre .
creed is over the hill , and ... the russian hasn' t fought anybody .
keep movin ' .
stick him !
drago' s moving in again .
a left hand by creed .
another left hand by creed , and drago moves away .
another left hand by creed .
drago waiting , waiting , cocking that right hand .
a punishing right by the russian .
get outta there !
get outta there !
a left .
he' s taking some punishment now .
drago moves him against the ropes .
tie him up now !
the russian ties him up and throws creed across the ring !
move !
it is drago with the upper hand now .
get outta that corner !
another right !
another right !
creed is against the ropes !
i think they may stop it .
what are you guys doin ' ? !
this is supposed to be an exhibition !
tremendous end to the first round by the russian , and a very bloody apollo creed .
the soviet' s strength is incredible !
champ , look .
i gotta stop ya .
this fight' s finished .
i gotta call it .
you can' t do no more .
i' m here to fight him .
he' s killin ' ya !
i gotta stop this thing .
promise me you' re not gonna stop it .
that was a pulverising round for the ex champion .
hey , folks .
ivan drago is definitely for real .
you don' t stop this fight , no matter what .
apollo !
apollo !
no matter what .
creed now comes out for round two dancing around .
the legs appear to be still a little rubbery .
get your hands up .
and now it is the russian just standing there , trying to intimidate creed .
and the russian throws a right hand to the jaw !
another right to the head !
creed' s being pounded without mercy !
stop the fight !
the referee is thrown across the ring !
throw the towel !
throw the towel !
i' ve never seen apollo take so much .
throw the damn towel !
no !
my god !
creed is down !
apollo is down , and he could be badly hurt .
get these guys outta here .
the winner , lvan drago .
let me through !
apollo !
i cannot be defeated .
is he ok ?
somebody get a doctor in here !
there is no movement by creed .
i defeat old man .
is he dead ?
get outta here !
it' s absolute pandemonium !
will ya let him breathe ?
soon ...
i defeat real champion .
where' s the stretcher ?
let him breathe , for god' s sake !
what started out as a joke has turned out to be a disaster .
creed is in a very serious condition .
is the man alive ?
you can make it , apollo .
if he dies ... he dies .
there' s a lot i could say ... about this man .
but i don' t know if it matters now .
i guess what matters is ... what he stood for , what he lived for , and ... what he died for .
you always did everything ... the way you wanted it .
i know i didn' t understand that , but ...
now i understand .
i' il never forget you , apollo .
you' re the best .
rocky , is the decision final ?
yes .
is this the first time the champion has given up his crown ?
i don' t know about that .
doesn' t the title matter ?
not until this is over .
considering rocky' s punching power , do you still expect an easy fight ?
yes , of course .
it' s a matter of size ... and evolution .
isn' t it , gentlemen ?
drago is the most perfectly trained athlete ever .
this other man has not the size , or the endurance , or the genetics to win .
it' s physically impossible for this little man to win .
drago is a look at the future .
champ , how much are you making for this fight ?
no money .
it' s not about money .
has the fight date been set yet ?
december 25th .
why christmas ?
that' s what i was told .
where ?
it' s in russia .
are you nuts ?
rocky , what' s going on ?
we fight in soviet union , or we fight nowhere .
why don' t you ask drago' s wife why she is afraid ?
tell them , please .
i' m afraid for my husband' s life .
we have threats of violence everywhere .
we are not in politics .
all i want is for my husband to be safe , to be treated fairly .
you call him a killer .
he' s a professional fighter , not a killer .
you have this belief that you are better than us , that this country is so very good , and we are so very bad .
you have this belief that you are so fair , and we are so very cruel .
it is lies and false propaganda to support this antagonistic and violent government !
violent ?
we don' t keep our people behind a wall with machine guns !
who are you ?
who am l ?
i' m ... the unsilent majority , bigmouth !
good !
yes , good !
insult us ! ls more typical rude behaviour towards visiting foreigners !
but perhaps this simple defeat of this little so called champion will be a perfect example of how pathetically weak your society has become .
we go !
mrs balboa !
how do you feel about russia ?
is your husband going to moscow ?
how does it feel to be part of such a controversial decision ?
did creed' s death make up your husband' s mind ?
i don' t know what you' re talking about !
why is he going at christmas ?
when will you be going to russia ?
i' m not going to russia .
i don' t know what you' re talking about !
i don' t know what you people are doing here !
rocky ?
yeah ?
you all right ?
yeah .
fine .
why' d you do it ?
i just gotta do what i gotta do .
you don' t have to do anything .
no , adrian , i do , and ...
i gotta leave this place , too .
so where are you ... going ?
they said they were gonna let me train in russia .
i just wanna go someplace where i ain' t gonna think about nothin ' except him .
rocky , give it some time .
don' t do this .
a lot of people live with hurt .
a lot of people don' t have a choice .
i do .
and for that you' re willing to lose everything ?
adrian , this ain' t everything .
this house , and the cars , and all the stuff we got ... that ain' t everything .
there' s a lot more than this , adrian .
before , there were reasons to fight i understood , but i don' t understand this .
even if you win , what have you won ?
apollo' s still gone .
why can' t you change your thinking ?
everybody else does !
cos i' m a fighter !
that' s the way i' m made , adrian .
that' s what you married .
we can' t change what we are .
yes , you can .
you can' t change anythin ' .
all we can do is go with what we are .
you can' t go with what you are !
have you read the papers ?
do you know what everybody says ?
it' s suicide !
you' ve seen him .
you know how strong he is .
you can' t win !
oh , adrian .
adrian always tells the truth .
no , maybe i can' t win .
maybe the only thing i can do ... is just take everythin ' he' s got .
but to beat me ... he' s gonna have to kill me .
and to kill me , he' s gonna have to have the heart to stand in front of me .
and to do that , he' s gotta be willin ' to die himself .
and i don' t know if he' s ready to do that .
i don' t know .
we' re not indestructible
baby , better get that straight
i think it' s unbelievable
how you give in to the hands of fate
cos some things are worth fightin ' for
some feelings never die
i' m not askin ' for another chance
ljust wanna know why
there' s no easy way out
there' s no shortcut home
there' s no easy way out
givin ' in can' t be wrong
i don' t wanna pacify you
i don' t wanna drag you down
but i' m feelin ' like a prisoner
like a stranger in a no name town
i see only angry faces
so afraid that could be you and me
talkin ' about what might have been
and thinkin ' about what used to be
there' s no easy way out

paulie , did you pack your toothbrush ?
you know how tobacco stains your teeth .
ifl' ve told you once , i' ve told you ...
hey !
hey !
stop bustin ' my chops .
paulie !
i' m gonna have her wires tied when i get back .
when will you be back ?
oh , pretty soon .
are you scared ?
nah .
yes , you are .
a little , maybe ?
well , wouldn' t you be ?
if a big giant man wanted to beat me up , i' d be real scared .
well , the truth is , you know , sometimes ...
i do get a little scared , you know .
when i' m in that ring and i' m really gettin ' hit on , and my arms hurt so much i can' t even lift them , and i' m thinkin ' ,
god !
i wish this guy would hit me on the chin so i don' t feel nothin ' any more .
then there' s another side that comes out that isn' t so scared .
there' s another side that , like , wants to take more , that wants to go that one more round , because by goin ' that one more round when you don' t think you can , that' s what makes all the difference in your life .
you know what i mean ?
and will you remember one more thing ?
will you remember that ...
daddy thinks you' re the best boy in the world , hm ?
and that daddy loves you ... no matter what ?
will you ?
i gotta go now .
you gonna take care of everythin ' ?
ok .
and don' t forget to feed your robot .
bye , baby .
good luck .
thanks .
come on !
the meter' s runnin ' !
two worlds collide , rival nations
it' s a primitive clash , venting years of frustration
bravely we hope against all hope
there is so much at stake
seems our freedom' s up against the ropes
does the crowd understand ?
ls it east versus west
or man against man ?
can any nation stand alone ?
ln the burning heart
just about to burst
there' s a quest for answers , an unquenchable thirst
ln the darkest night ...
what a horrendous flight .
this is russia ?
it don' t look so tough , rock .
mr balboa .
we take you to quarters now .
hey , when does the sun come up ?
this is detrimental to my sinuses .
weather changes , hour to hour .
get used to it .
get in car now .
we have very long trip .
he sounds like dracula' s cousin .
ln the warrior' s code there' s no surrender
though his body says " stop " , his spirit cries " never !
deep in our soul a quiet ember
knows it' s you against you
it' s the paradox that drives us on
it' s a battle of wills
ln the heat ofattack , it' s the passion that kills
that victory is yours alone
ln the burning heart
just about to burst
there' s a quest for answers , an unquenchable thirst
ln the darkest night , rising like a spire
ln the burning heart , the unmistakable fire
like you requested , yes ?
you requested this dumb location ?
yeah .

you plannin ' to grow reindeer or somethin ' ?

apollo was like my son .
i raised him .
and when he died ... a part of me died .
but now ... you' re the one .
you' re the one that' s gonna keep his spirit alive .
you' re the one ... that' s gonna make sure that he didn' t die for nothing .
now you' re gonna have to go through hell , worse than any nightmare that you ever dreamed .
but in the end ...

drago !
drago !
drago !
hello , and merry christmas from a very unusual place .
we' re in moscow .
i' m barry tompkins , along with ai bandiero , and this promises to be the most watched event in boxing history .
the lron horse from america , rocky balboa , comes here to the soviet union ...
ivan drago : since that tragedy in las vegas and the death of apollo creed , he' s been re nicknamed " death from above " .
drago !
drago !
the general secretary of the soviet and other members of the politburo have now made their way to their seats high above the ring here in moscow .
i know you' re kinda busy , but i wanna tell you some things i never told you .
i know sometimes i act stupid and i say stupid things , but you kept me around when other people would' ve said " drop that bum . " you give me respect .
it' s hard for me to say these kinda things because that ain' t my way , but if i could unzip myself and step out and be someone else , i' d wanna be you .
you' re all heart , rock .
thanks , paulie .
now blast this guy' s teeth out !
i' il try .
one of the fighters is starting to make his way through this crowd toward the ring .
listen to this crowd !
this borders on pure hatred .
rocky' s face : absolutely like stone , a picture of concentration , and the booing crowd here does not seem to bother him one bit .
the champ has a look that could burn through lead .
it seems the booing crowd has absolutely no effect on the man .
his concentration is like stone .
that' s my dad .
we know .
what do you think we are nerds ?
listen to this crowd .
it sounds insane .
and now the entrance of the russian national champion .
ivan drago , a man with an entire country in his corner .
look at the expression on the face of lvan drago .
he seems impervious to this madness of the crowd .
he' s like a volcano just waiting to erupt .
the russian is cool as he acknowledges his premier .
i would like to point out again , this is a non sanctioned fight .
this is not for the title .
the american boxing commission has not sanctioned it .
ladies and gentlemen ...
rocky balboa !
it' s unbelievable .
i have never seen such a hostile crowd .
ivan drago !
roaring for their champion !
the two men are walking to the centre .
it' s an unbelievable sight to see .
they' re toe to toe .
the russian towers above the american .
it' s a true case of david and goliath here .
it' s unbelievable , the ... the condition of both men .
i must break you .
remember what i said about wanting to be you ?
forget it .
thanks , paul .
take it straight to him , and be a rock for me , you understand ?
be a rock for me !
be strong !
all right ?
take it to him !
no pain .
no pain .
no pain .
no pain .
no pain .
all right , rock .
do it !
there' s the bell .
rocky comes to the centre of the ring ,
iike the russian , way back into balboa' s corner now .
get outta there !
let' s go , rocky !
balboa gets out of the corner , and it is drago backing rocky up with a jab .
and balboa is not staying on balance because of the long jab of the russian .
brace yourself !
brace yourself !
hands up !
charge him !
now !
he can' t seem to touch the russian .
rocky pounding away , and he' s just hit him with everything he' s got .
and drago just smiled at him .
keep choppin ' away !
chop him down !
chop him down !
rocky balboa is in serious trouble !
they might have to stop this one before somebody gets killed .
reach and grab him !
reach and grab him !
rocky woke the sleeping giant , and now he' s paying the price !
a right hand from drago sends rocky balboa 1 5 feet across the ring , and the champ is down !
come on !
get up !
hands up !
hands up !
drago continuing to punish rocky .
he will not let him out of that corner , and rocky balboa is just trying to get through this first round .
the russian just threw rocky balboa into his own corner like a rag doll .
what a tough three minutes for rocky balboa .
he' s not only fighting an invincible opponent , he' s also fighting a hostile crowd , and the russian premier and most of the politburo looking on .
what' s happenin ' out there ?
he' s winnin ' .
i see three of him out there .
hit the one in the middle .
right !
hit the one in the middle !
yeah .
you' re not doing as you' re told .
the american is small and weak ...
weak .
take his heart .
if you hurt him , you' il take his heart .
no pain !
keep workin ' !
round two .
it' s been a one sided fight so far .
it' il take more than luck for rocky to survive this round .
slip him a hook , rock !
slip him a hook !
balboa trying to stay in the middle of the ring against the big russian .
do what you gotta do !
stay with him !
for all intent , balboa should be all finished , but he' s fighting back ferociously .
rocky !
balboa goes down again from a right hand !
bounces right back up .
he' s gettin ' killed out there !
rocky balboa has taken lvan drago' s best punches so far .
he' s cut and he' s bleeding , but he' s on his feet and he' s on the run !
he' s cut !
he' s cut !
the russian' s cut !
and it' s a bad cut !
and now it' s rocky balboa coming after lvan drago !
incredible !
get him !
drago wants to go on !
he grabs balboa by the throat !
balboa picking up the russian and throws him to the ground like a wrestler .
it' s a gutter war !
no holds barred in moscow !
rocky may be on the receiving end so far , but he' s here to fight .
this is shaping up to be a personal war , and right now it' s anybody' s boxing match .
you' re doin ' good , rocko .
i couldn' t do better myself .
how can you do this ?
he' s nothing ... soft !!
you got him hurt bad .
now he' s worried .
you cut him !
you hurt him !
you see ?
you see ?
he' s not a machine .
he' s a man !
he' s not human ...
he' s like a piece of iron .
you want it more than he does !
no pain !
no pain .
no pain .
no pain .
ok !
take it to him !
take it to him !
take it to him !
get up !
and a big right hand by rocky balboa !
you' re doin ' fine .
you' re doin ' great .
come on !
a few cheers now for rocky balboa !
suddenly moscow is pro rocky !
no pain .
no pain .
al , this place is ready to explode .
lethal punch after punch .
amazing willpower !
and rocky' s determination is beginning to win over what was a hostile crowd .
this is incredible .
what round is it ?
1 5 .
one more round .
there' s no stoppin ' us now .
this is our round .
rocky !
rocky !
no stoppin ' now !
you start and you don' t stop !
all your strength !
all your power !
all your love !
everythin ' you' ve got !
you trained this fool .
he' s a disgrace .
listen to them ...
our people cheer for hlm ! ...
you idiot .
wln !
nyet !
i fight to win !
for me !
for me !
to win you gotta knock him out !
punch and punch till you can' t punch no more !
this is your whole life here !
yeah , knock him out , rocko .
do it now !
now !
there' s the bell .
the war is on .
this is the last round .
to the end .
which of these magnificent fighters will be standing at the end ?
drago snaps out a stiff jab .
and another .
rocky taking punishment .
trying to get inside .
he' s completely exhausted .
come on , rock !
what are you waitin ' for ? !
rocky !
rocky !
hit him !
come on !
fight !
balboa is chopping the russian down !
rocky balboa throwing punches at the russian .
and drago throws a hard right hand that stuns rocky balboa !
don' t go down !

forget technique , forget strategy .
this is a street fight .
who wants it most ?
