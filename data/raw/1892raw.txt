good evening , child .
evening , mama .
home already ?
i' m so happy .
mama ...
not so fast .
please .
leave me be .
i' m tired .
i can quite believe it .
your last pupil left 3 hours ago .
might i know where you' ve been all this time ?
please .
no , you don' t .
not until you tell me !
no .
i went for a walk .
do you mind ?
i spent 8 hours in my cage .
i was tired and needed some air .
for three hours ?
absolutely !
magnificent .
just as i thought .
where' s the bankbook ?
10, 000 schillings !
tell me , have you lost your mind ?
where' s my grey autumn suit ?
no idea .
give that back .
no .
no .
bitch !
i remember that talk show .
the guy advocated fines for dog owners whose dogs crap in the street .
bullshit .
the creep was defending the idea that women are inferior to men .
rubbish .
if you' d let me get a word in ...
who rattled your cage !
should cut your hands off .
beating your own mother !
that frock was far too gaudy anyway .
at your age , you should know what suits you .
can' t you stop , you cow ?
wasn' t ruining that enough for you ?
i wish ...
what ?
you daren' t say it ?
don' t bother .
i know what you wish .
i could have had a heart attack from the agitation .
if that' s what you want , go ahead .
stop it , mama , you don' t know what you' re saying .
there' s a real hole here .
here , too .
sorry .
but why do you do these things ?
why do you do these things ?
i' m sorry .
truly sorry .
let me look .
never mind that .
that' s how it is .
we' re a hot blooded family .
come on , stop crying .
i' il make some coffee .
we' il have a cup together .
okay ?
nothing in life comes free .
you' il just have to give more private lessons .
your vanity must not stop us buying our apartment .
you can' t contradict me there .
i paid this month' s instalment long ago , don' t worry .
in any case , the dress only cost 6, 500 .
i' il pay the remainder back in tomorrow .
i don' t understand why someone of your standing slaps make up on and fritters money away on frocks that will soon be out of fashion .
i' d be wearing that dress for years .
the cut was so classical .
it was ageless .
if memory serves me right , you used to have a dress just like it .
remember ?
you must be dreaming .
it was a designer label .
the finishing was remarkable .
it would have lasted forever .
do you still need the light ?
did they really annoy you today ?
no more than usual .
did you have the schober girl ?
isn' t friday her day ?
well ?
she' s not untalented .
she has a surprising affinity for schubert .
schubert' s your department , don' t forget .
that' s not for you to say .
you' re hardly a judge of what is my department musically .
if you want your pupils to have a career instead of you ...
mama ...
no one must surpass you , my girl .
no mama .
don' t be dizzy ...
erika .
don' t worry , mama .
the plano teacher
a little less pedal wouldn' t go amiss .
it' s not enough just to take your foot off .
a note may not be as long as it is written and may not be marked as long as it should be held . from the novel by elfrlede jellnek
and two , and three and four ...
and one , and two , and three and four ...
and one , and two ...
dogs are barking ,
rattling their chains .
people are sleeping
in their beds .
do you have no ear for what coldness is ?
or maybe you' re just sloppy ?
and let go .
and let go .
the music is not purely descriptive .
and it' s not drenched in indifference and sentimentality .
and let go .
you see ?
dogs are barking ,
rattling their chains .
people are sleeping
in their beds .
a wrong note in beethoven is better than bad interpretation .
you play only phrases .
ignore the structure and you' il ruin the sonata .
back to the top of the page .
i guessed you were for the recital .
allow me to introduce ...
professor , please , do come in .
hello , auntie .
and your mother .
good evening .
you' ve met my nephew ?
i was about to introduce myself .
my name' s walter klemmer .
at the risk of seeming prosaic , after sampling spiritual nourishment of such quality ,
i' ve organised , for the interval , a buffet to sustain the artists and , i hope , for your pleasure , too .
through here .
my husband' s very particular ...
excuse me , auntie .
sorry to interrupt but i can' t wait .
i hope it' s not too forward of me to kiss the hand that plays such bach .
you can stop now .
where do you get such unfashionable enthusiasm ?
i' m delighted the tradition of recitals lives on .
it was practically extinct .
the masters die , then their music .
people today only ever listen to pop or rock .
you' re right .
families like this are no more .
generations of laryngologists toiled over beethoven' s last quartets .
now , at best , academics stamp their feet in time to the trumpety trumps of bruckner .
disdaining bruckner is immature ,
mr ...
klemmer ?
tell me , what enables you to talk about music so precociously ?
your aunt said you studied ...
low voltage , professor .
low voltage .
it was made between 1620 and 1630 by marcel pichler .
from hallein .
a rare piece .
here .
it is played
like a cello .
its common name is leg viol or quinton .
recently , i found a painting that exactly shows this instrument .
not this type of instrument .
i mean , specifically this instrument .
the painting depicts a concert of viole da gamba at the court of duke augustus von braunschweig wolfenbuttel .
can i fetch you something ?
not at all .
why ?
it' s fascinating .
look at them .
do they give a fig about the benefits of illness ?
have you read adorno on schumann' s fantasia in c major ?
no .
he talks of his twilight .
it' s not schumann bereft of reason , but just before .
a fraction before .
he knows he' s losing his mind .
it torments him but he clings on , one last time .
it' s being aware of what it means to lose oneself before being completely abandoned .
i' d say you are a good teacher .
thank you .
you talk about things as if they were yours .
it' s rare .
and i think you know it .
schubert and schumann are my favourites , that' s all .
since my father died completely mad in steinhof asylum ,
i can talk easily about the twilight of the mind , can' t l ?
if you' d really prefer not to eat , perhaps you' d care for a drink of something ?
go ahead .
i had to sing for my supper .
dr. blonsky with his instrument fetish is such a bore .
honestly ,
klemmer , or whatever he' s called , seems a bit of a leech ?
walter studies at the engineering school .
but his musicality keeps up with technology , as you will understand when you listen to him play .
over to you , walter .
my uncle exaggerates shamelessly .
after the professor' s performance , i feel doubly amateur .
i had intended to play for you schenberg' s opus 33b , so that my wrong notes might go unnoticed .
not very funny , i know .
but a discussion of schubert and schumann' s madness
left me deeply impressed .
i have decided to drop schenberg for my favourite piece by schubert : the scherzo from the sonata in a major .
... dreaming of what they don' t have , replenished of good and bad .
and next morning , all flown away .
and here , the mood switches to irony .
d ...
d ...
d ...
so what ?
so what ?
they' ve had their pleasure .
d ...
d ...
d ...
that' s the obstinacy of the complacent middle class .
and they hope that what they left behind
might be waiting for them on the pillows .
excuse me , professor .
can i have a word ?
go ahead .
anna says you may not let her play in the jubilee concert .
i said a soloist needs more than talent .
she doesn' t practice enough ?
only she can tell .
she works 8 hours a day .
it' s the end result that counts , not the hours .
for her , only music counts .
look at her .
schubert isn' t a walk in the park .
i didn' t say you wouldn' t play .
we' il see how you gel with the singer .
excuse me , i have a rehearsal .
goodbye .
goodbye .
the professor is right .
without total commitment , you won' t get anywhere .
wipe your nose .
what do you look like ?
your mother wants you to call her .
i' ve only just arrived .
i don' t know .
at least 3 hours .
no ! please mama ...
in that case , i' il take a taxi .
yes !
i' m not a baby .
i have to go now .
can we play the trill the same ?
i' il start on the upper note .
yes !
sorry to disturb you .
what is it ?
professor kohut ?
what do you want ?
at the conservatory , no one interrupts lessons .
i apologise .
i am very sorry but i wanted to come to you rather than ask just anybody .
about what ?
the entrance exam .
i want to join your master class .
that' s very flattering , young man .
i hope your interruption is not to arouse interest your talents don' t merit .
application forms are available in the secretary' s office .
first floor , door 11 .
please excuse us , we have work to do .
continue .
go on .
mr. klemmer !
hello ,
mr. walter klemmer ?
that' s correct .
please ...
your programme is particularly difficult .
where do you wish to begin ?
wherever you prefer .
professor , it' s your class that mr. klemmer wishes to join : which piece would you like to hear first ? don' t mind .
the first on the list .
go ahead .
well ?
stunningly brilliant .
no , seriously , i think it wasn' t too bad .
he just put " private lessons " .
that' s even more remarkable .
i don' t know how seriously he takes his engineering but for someone whose priority is not the piano , bravo .
it' s amazing .
i quite agree .
he truly is very talented .
ladies ?
gentlemen ?
i vote for .
yes , me too .
no doubt about it .
what do you say ?
your opinion counts most .
he' s applying to join your class .
after such euphoria , it' s hard to voice reservations .
i can' t say i totally share your enthusiasm .
clearly he doesn' t lack talent but i wonder , and i ask you , what does he expect from us ?
for a professional career , he' s too old .
by accepting him , we' il reject a more motivated student .
and , frankly , i find his histrionics suspicious or even unpleasant .
i don' t see what you mean .
in the andantino , there were no histrionics , as you put it .
everyone knows our views on schubert diverge .
please , let' s not waste time .
20 people are waiting .
i feel unable to nurture the artistic temperament or virtuosity of mr. klemmer .
dinner' s ready !
coming , mama !
sit down , i' il bring the sauce .
can i switch off the tv ?
if it bothers you .
don' t you like that ?
i' m tired .
you look it .
are the auditions so exhausting ?
boring , rather .
that' s tiring , too .
what' s wrong with you ?
what do you mean ?
look .
is that why you' re in a bad mood ?
you might be more careful .
it' s not very appetising .
mare on heat seeks ardent , successful stallion , for jumping and dressage .
must be 8 inches .
hello , mr. naprawnik .
hello , teacher
who' s she ?
my piano teacher .
don' t pick out the inner voices so much .
do you know where the melody is ?
it sounds as clear as a muddy windscreen .
probably due to the images lodged in your mind .
you have one approach for bach , beethoven and the others .
what made you want to study music ?
your meagre talent ?
i assure you it' s not worth it .
take a job playing in a strip joint and stop wasting my time .
teacher ,
what ?
i' m sorry .
what for ?
for earlier ...
at the newsagents .
why ?
why are you sorry ?
what for ?
it doesn' t work like that .
sorry isn' t enough , if i don' t know why .
are you sorry because you' re a pig ?
or because your friends are pigs ?
or because all women are bitches for making you a pig ?
or just because you got caught ?
the lesson is ended .
i propose your mother comes to see me .
maybe she can shed some light on this .
well ?
what are you sorry for ?
i' m listening .
the silence is deafening .
see you next time , along with your mother .
now , please remove yourself .
i' il need my break to recover .
goodbye .
yes !
this time i' m expected .
the break' s not over yet .
and the lesson hasn' t begun .
can i take out my scores while i' m waiting ?
you know i voted against you ?
no .
i don' t believe you' re serious about music but rather about the kudos it brings .
you know that' s untrue .
and even if it were true , would it be such a shameful motive ?
yes .
what have you brought ?
you should forget schubert .
schenberg is all ...
i fought to win your attention .
give me a chance .
i know you' re not as indifferent as you pretend .
i neglected my studies for you .
it' s the truth !
you may think it' s ridiculous , but since the recital at the blonskys ,
i' ve had you stuck in my mind like a nut on a bolt .
i apologise for being so technical .
i never intended to apply here .
stop lying , it won' t wash .
i' m not lying .
for next time , find a copy of opus 19 .
let' s talk first .
i can' t see the point .
don' t just stand there .
sit down and begin .
is this your last lesson ?
please .
pretend you have a migraine or something .
it' s lovely out .
either you play or my migraine will end this lesson .
it' s bound to finish late .
today' s our first mendelssohn rehearsal .
so , don' t call up every 5 minutes .
it' s embarrassing .
viora of the philharmonic' s coming .
he' il think i' m a little girl .
is that clear ?
if it ends late , take a taxi .
yes mama .
goodbye .
i adore lying in the name of love .
i' m so happy for you .
if she calls after 10 , don' t answer .
is that okay ?
it will be a pleasure .
good evening , this is mrs. kohut .
may i speak to my daughter ?
what' s wrong ?
what the ... ?
shit !
stay there !
stay there , cunt !
are you crazy or something ?
your father died this afternoon .
above all , keep calm .
it' s so inconsiderate of you !
think of the consequences !
kind of you to honour us with your presence .
might we know what kept you ?
stop blubbing !
what happened ?
i have diarrhoea .
are you scared or what ?
a pianist needs solid nerves .
how can i perform after ...
don' t overdo it .
we should be going up .
don' t be so pathetic .
they won' t bite .
it' s a rehearsal .
did i overestimate you ?
you think me devoid of sensitivity and indeed i can be superficial .
you see , i admit it .
but telling me to forget schubert was atrociously unfair .
it' s quite the contrary .
there are days , like after our first lesson , when ...
the sight of blood makes me ill .
go to her .
be her brave protector .
what happened ?
let me .
call a doctor .
don' t stare , there' s nothing to see .
go back to the hall .
come on .
wait .
why ?
why ?
stop it !
i told you to stop !
if you don' t stop immediately , i' il leave .
erika ...
look at me , not your penis .
be quiet .
don' t move or i' il leave .
no .
erika , i love you .
no one has ...
if you won' t be quiet , you' il end up all alone here .
why do you hurt me ?
i can' t hold back .
i said , silence !
keep going .
come here .
that' s it .
it' s coming .
keep going .
don' t stop !
i' il write down what you can do to me .
all my desires on paper for you to peruse at will .
you don' t like that ?
you can' t leave me like this .
come on .
i' ve no desire to touch that now .
keep going , please .
out of the question !
hands off .
or we never see each other again .
it' s totally sick what you' re doing here .
and it hurts !
i sympathise .
stop it .
don' t be stupid .
you' re spoiling it .
i won' t touch you again .
i want you to stay like that , that' s all .
facing me !
don' t put it away .
it' s not me who' s stupid .
it' s you .
you should know what you can and can' t do to a man .
you bitch !
shut up !
the playing field has to be level .
if you think ...
wait .
i won' t move , i promise .
i won' t say a word .
you will receive my instructions .
by letter .
or face to face .
or maybe over the phone .
now , you can put it away .
facing me .
how about a little smile ?
go on .
don' t be so serious , pretty lady .
go on .
next time , we' il do much better .
i promise .
practice will make you perfect .
at least 2 months , with no guarantee of complete recovery .
that' s terrible .
and she really was quite good .
she has the nerve .
she played amazingly yesterday despite nearly not making it .
pull yourself together .
you' re no use to anna if you break down like that .
for the moment , we must wait .
she mustn' t neglect her left hand .
that' s always her weak point .
also , she' il be scarred for life .
just imagine .
a pianist with a disfigured hand .
she' s hardly attractive .
her only attribute was her talent .
that' s why we sacrificed everything .
she sacrificed everything .
sorry ?
you said we .
it' s anna who sacrificed everything .
yes , naturally .
who would do such a thing ?
the police say it must have been another student acting out of jealousy .
can you imagine it ?
being so evil ?
she' s always been a loner .
she hardly has any friends .
they' il find the man who did it .
he deserves his hands chopping off .
my next lesson is waiting .
i' il have to ask you to leave .
tell anna she' s welcome to drop in when she' s better .
remind her about her left hand .
i' il tell her .
thank you very much .
she' il come by .
she admires you so much .
chin up , mrs. schober .
who will replace anna for the concert ?
no one .
no student could at such short notice .
i' ve been asked to stand in for the singer' s sake .
that' s very good .
anna will be pleased .
goodbye teacher .
stop .
back to the beginning .
you gladly ignore the dynamics .
what does it say ?
piano .
exactly .
and then ?
forte piano .
and then ?
pianissimo .
and diminuendo and mezzo forte , forte , fortissimo , sforzatissimo .
schubert' s dynamics range from scream to whisper not loud to soft .
anarchy hardly seems your forte .
why not stick to clementi ?
schubert was quite ugly .
did you know ?
with your looks , nothing can ever hurt you .
why destroy what could bring us together ?
mannerism is no ...
why can' t i look at you ?
because if i do , i won' t resist the temptation to kiss you on the neck .
may i kiss you on the neck ?
can i get you a glass of water ?
thanks .
when can i see you ?
let' s call each other .
let' s go away this weekend .
just you and l .
i can' t , i' m going out with my mother .
cancel .
forget your mother .
think of us .
we must make up for lost time .
do you mean me ?
i must make up for lost time ?
darling !
stop always thinking of others , your mother , your scruples ...
you talk of anarchy but sacrifice love to be with mama .
let yourself go .
allow yourself feelings for once .
don' t be such a leech .
you cough because you' re uptight .
i have no feelings .
get that into your head .
if ever i do , they won' t defeat my intelligence .
i love you .
don' t be so cowardly .
is what you' ve written just as cowardly ?
don' t touch it !
not now .
i want you to read it alone .
now , get stuck in to schubert .
that' s all you may do in this room .
piano .
con intimissimo sentimento .
erika !
are you mad ?
what are you doing ?
i followed you .
i said we' d speak on the phone .
you can' t drive me crazy like that and then run off .
drive you crazy ?
let' s go somewhere where we can talk in private .
did you read the letter ?
i don' t want any letters .
i want us to talk !
i advise you to leave now .
never hound the woman you claim to love .
you should know that , even at your age .
if you value my affection , go .
i' il call you tomorrow to fix a date .
okay ?
take your hat off .
what ?
good evening .
i have matters to discuss with mr. klemmer .
what' s that supposed to mean ?
we won' t bother you .
we' il talk in my room .
come on .
excuse me .
if you try to come in , you' il be sorry .
there' s no food in .
i didn' t expect visitors .
don' t put yourself out , i' ve already eaten .
come here .
first , read the letter .
you' ve still got it ?
yes .
so , read it now , please .
do you want to finish me off ?
i said i don' t want to read any letters .
i' m here , you' re here .
we' re made of flesh and blood .
don' t be so scared .
i' m not .
i want all you want .
but read it first .
is that why we barricaded the door ?
perhaps .
erika ...
please !
i don' t know how much longer i want to play this game .
heavy .
sit down there , please .
on the contrary , if i beg , tighten my bonds , please .
adjust the belt by at least 2 or 3 holes .
the tighter the better .
then , gag me with some stockings i will have ready .
tuff them in so hard that i' m incapable ... of making any sound .
next , take off the blindfold , please , and sit down on my face and punch me in the stomach to force me to thrust my tongue in your behind .
is this supposed to be serious ?
you' re making fun of me , aren' t you ?
you want a slap ?
for that is my dearest wish .
hands and feet tied behind my back and locked up next door to my mother but out of her reach behind my bedroom door , till the next morning .
don' t worry about my mother , she' s my problem .
take all the door keys with you from the apartment .
don' t leave a single one here .
what will all this open up for me ?
maybe you' d open your cultured mouth and comment on this shit .
no ?
if you catch me disobeying any of your orders , hit me , please , even with the back of your hand on my face .
ask me why i don' t cry out to mother or why i don' t fight back .
above all , say things like that , so that i realise just how powerless i am .
what' s going on in there ?
open up !
move that chest .
don' t you want to let her in ?
do you want me to hit you in front of her ?
calm down !
be quiet and watch the tv !
open up or you' il be sorry .
stop making a fuss !
incredible !
erika !
do you have no sense of decency ?
invading people' s homes like this .
the sheer nerve of it !
are you angry with me ?
i hope you' re not .
it' s not very well written , i know .
i' m a pianist , not a poet .
after all , love is built on banal things .
think it over .
you have my phone number .
like i said , i want everything you want .
i have all we need .
but it can wait till tomorrow .
aren' t you talking to me ?
do i disgust you ?
that' s not necessary .
the urge to be beaten has been in me for years .
i waited for you , you know ?
it' s not a joke , all i wrote .
you know that .
from now on , you give the orders .
from now on , you choose what i am to wear .
what colour do you prefer ?
you never said .
you' re not talking to me ?
you' re angry ?
say something then .
you' re sick .
you need treatment .
if you want to hit me , hit me .
i don' t want to soil my hands .
no one would touch your sort , even with gloves on .
i swear i loved you .
you don' t even know what it is .
right now , you repulse me .
fuck it .
... came to north america with the spanish .
left to roam free , they became the famous mustang .
today' s cowboys ' most loyal companion is the quarter horse .
very fast over short distances and with good stamina ...
you really are quite shameless .
what have you done with him ?
is he still in your room ?
it wouldn' t surprise me .
nothing surprises me any more .
but you can do what you want .
at your age .
good lord .
all those sacrifices for this .
that' s what you get in reward .
you carry on like that .
you can set up a bordello here .
who cares what the neighbours think !
as always , you do as you like !
i love you .
stop that !
have you gone insane ?
what are you ...
stop it !
don' t be so filthy , you' re out of your mind !
shut up .
i love you .
i love you , too .
but stop this now .
you' re mad !
you' re mad .
you' re completely mad .
go to sleep now .
you' re going to need all your energy .
even if you' re just standing in , you must be well prepared .
you never know who might be in the audience .
i saw the hairs on your sex .
walter !
can i have a word ?
someone to see you .
is that your little sister ?
don' t run away , he' s coming .
what do you want ?
speak to you .
i' m listening .
not here , i can' t .
over there .
how did you manage to find me ?
just there .
go on in .
forgive me for the letter .
i' m an idiot .
i shouldn' t have done that to you out of the blue .
like you said , we should have talked first .
forgive me .
what are you doing ?
stop it .
get up now .
come on .
come on top of me .
you want me , don' t you ?
you' re mad .
come on .
i love you .
i' il never write anything you don' t want .
you tell me what you want , okay ? come !
someone might come in .
you' re being ridiculous .
get up .
hang on , let me do it .
let me do it , i said .
wait !
here .
i can' t , not here .
stop it .
i can' t .
it doesn' t matter .
i can' t do it here .
i know you want to protect us , but i don' t care if people catch us .
i don' t care .
i love you .
i love you , too .
come on .
you have to help me .
i don' t believe it .
i' m sorry .
don' t look .
don' t look .
i must really disgust you .
no woman ever puked it back .
sorry .
i don' t know what happened .
i' m clean .
i' m all clean .
like a baby .
inside as well as outside .
for you and thanks to you , darling .
do you like me calling you darling ?
it' s absolutely marvellous .
you must be patient .
i' il give you all the names , we' il play all the games you want .
you know you really stink ?
sorry , you stink so much , no one will ever come close to you .
you' d better leave town until you don' t stink so bad .
rinse your mouth more often , not just when my cock makes you puke .
who is it ?
open up .
open up now !
what do you want ?
i said , open the door !
quiet !
you' il wake the whole building .
i' m opening it .
don' t do that again , okay ?
what do you mean ?
shut up , you sad cow !
just then ,
i was under your window and i was jerking off .
that' s what you want , huh ?
you want to ...
is that it ?
you' re a witch , a pervert !
you want to give everyone your illness , don' t you ?
not me !
i did apologise .
fuck your stupid apologies !
wasn' t last night enough for you ?
will you make this a habit ?
screaming the house down .
go back to bed !
walter , please .
get out !
be off with you !
now !
not as you imagined ?
we' il see about this .

we have all night .
let' s pick up where we left off .
is this really what you had imagined ?
no .
what then ?
you' il be sorry .
just because we' re women doesn' t mean you' il get away with it .
let me go .
this is unbelievable !
at least this one has a key .
open up !
how about one for your daughter' s room ?
open up !
that' s that dealt with .
as for my mother , pay no attention to her .
yes ?
am i quoting you exactly ?
open up !
you will see !
give me lots of slaps , darling .
hit me hard ...
no .
hit me around the face and hit me hard .
at your service , dear lady .
is that what you want ?
stop , please .
what then ?
not that .
stop , i beg you .
what are you doing ?
shut it or i kill her !
murderer !
stop .
where' s the water ?
in the kitchen .
don' t think you' il get me going ... by flashing your pathetic body .
you know ,
i do realise that all this isn' t very nice of me .
but if you' re honest , you' il admit you' re partly responsible .
i mean , it' s true ...
yes or no ?
yes .
am i right ?
yes , walter .
erika ?
yes .
are you okay ?
i' m okay
you can' t get a guy going , then take refuge on the ice .
not my face !
not my hands !
murderer !
aren' t you ashamed ?
i' m begging you to stop .
don' t touch my daughter .
leave my daughter alone .
i' m begging you .
why do you do that ?
i calm down and you try to cross me .
be a little cooperative , fuck it .
i' d be happy to learn to play .
but not if we only ever play by your rules .
you can' t delve around inside people , then reject them .
be nice to me , please .
you can' t let me go just like that .
stop , please .
you have to give a bit .
you can' t leave me all alone now .
love me , please .
are you trying to tell me i should go ?
i' d appreciate it if you tell no one .
anyhow , it' s for your own good .
you can' t humiliate a man that way and ...
it' s not possible .
will you be alright ?
do you need anything ?
okay ?
you know , love isn' t everything .
see you , then .
has he gone ?
