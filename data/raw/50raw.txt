men are haunted by the vastness of eternity .
and so we ask ourselves ... ... will our actions echo across the centuries ?
will strangers hear our names long after we' re gone ... ... and wonder who we were ... ... how bravely we fought ... ... how fiercely we loved ?
good day for the crows .
remove your army from my land .
i like your land .
i think we' il stay .
i like your soldiers too .
they won' t fight for you .
that' s what the messenians said .
and the arcadians and the epeians .
now they all fight for me .
you can' t have the whole world , agamemnon .
it' s too big , even for you .
i don' t want to watch another massacre .
let' s settle this war in the old manner .
your best fighter against my best .
and if my man wins ?
we' il leave thessaly for good .
boagrius !
achilles !
boagrius has this effect on many heroes .
careful who you insult , old king .
my king , achilles is not with the army .
where is he ?
i sent a boy to look for him .
i was having a good dream .
very good dream .
king agamemnon sent me .
he needs to ...
i' il speak to your king in the morning .
but my lord , it is morning .
they' re waiting for you .
are the stories about you true ?
they say your mother is an immortal goddess .
they say you can' t be killed .
i wouldn' t be bothering with the shield then , would i ?
the thessalonian you' re fighting ... ... he' s the biggest man i' ve ever seen .
i wouldn' t want to fight him .
that' s why no one will remember your name .
perhaps we should have our war tomorrow , when you' re better rested .
i should have you whipped for your impudence !
perhaps you should fight him .
achilles .
achilles .
look at the men' s faces .
you can save hundreds of them .
you can end this war with a swing of your sword .
let them go home to their wives .
imagine a king who fights his own battles .
wouldn' t that be a sight .
of all the warlords loved by the gods , i hate him the most .
is there no one else ?
is there no one else ?
who are you , soldier ?
achilles .
son of peleus .
achilles ?
i' il remember the name .
the ruler of thessaly carries this scepter .
give it to your king .
he' s not my king .
b rothers in arms !
friendship !
friendship !
princes of troy , on our last night together ... ... queen helen and i salute you .
we' ve had our conflicts before , it' s true .
we fought many battles , sparta and troy .
and fought well !
but i have always respected your father .
priam is a good king , a good man .
i respected him as an adversary .
i respect him now as my ally .
hector , paris , young princes , come .
stand .
drink with me .
let us drink to peace .
to peace between troy and sparta .
may the gods keep the wolves in the hills and the women in our beds .
for the gods .
for the gods .
you shouldn' t be here .
that' s what you said last night .
last night was a mistake .
and the night before ?
i' ve made many mistakes this week .
do you want me to go ?
pearls from the sea of propontis .
they' re beautiful .
but i can' t wear them .
menelaus would kill us both .
don' t be afraid of him .
i' m not afraid of dying .
i' m afraid of tomorrow .
i' m afraid of watching you sail away and knowing you' il never come back .
before you came to sparta , i was a ghost .
i walked , and i ate , and i swam in the sea ... ... but i was just a ghost .
you don' t have to fear tomorrow .
come with me .
don' t play with me .
don' t play .
if you come , we' il never be safe .
men will hunt us , the gods will curse us .
but i' il love you .
till the day they burn my body ... ... i will love you .
a beautiful morning .
poseidon has blessed our voyage .
sometimes the gods bless you in the morning and curse you in the afternoon .
drop sail !
do you love me , brother ?
would you protect me against any enemy ?
the last time you spoke to me like this ... ... you were 10 years old , and you' d just stolen father' s horse .
what have you done now ?
i must show you something .
where is she ?
i swear by the father of the gods , i will gut you here if you don' t tell me !
my king !
she left .
with the trojans .
the fisherman here saw her board their ship .
the trojans ?
with the young prince , paris .
she ...
get my ship ready .
turn us round .
back to sparta .
high on the sail !
wait , wait .
you fool !
listen to me .
do you know what you' ve done ?
do you know how many years our father worked for peace ?
i love her .
it' s all a game to you , isn' t it ?
you roam from town to town , bedding merchants ' wives and temple maids .
you think you know something about love .
what about your father' s love ?
you spat on him when you brought her on this ship !
what about the love for your country ?
you' d let troy burn for this woman ?
i won' t let you start a war for her .
may i speak ?
what you' re saying is true .
i' ve wronged you .
i' ve wronged our father .
if you want to take helen back to sparta , so be it .
but i go with her .
to sparta ?
they' il kill you .
then i' il die fighting .
oh , and that sounds heroic to you , doesn' t it ?
to die fighting .
little brother , have you ever killed a man ?
no .
ever seen a man die in combat ?
no .
i' ve killed men , and i' ve heard them dying .
and i' ve watched them dying .
and there' s nothing glorious about it .
nothing poetic .
you say you want to die for love .
you know nothing about dying .
and you know nothing about love !
all the same , i go with her .
i won' t ask you to fight my war .
you already have .
to troy !
about ship !
set sail !
i want her back .
well , of course you do .
she' s a beautiful woman .
i want her back so i can kill her with my own two hands .
i won' t rest till i' ve burned troy to the ground .
i thought you wanted peace with troy .
i should have listened to you .
peace is for the women ... ... and the weak .
empires are forged by war .
all my life , i' ve stood by your side , fought your enemies .
you' re the elder , you reap the glory .
this is the way of the world .
but have i ever complained ?
have i ever asked you for anything ?
never .
you' re a man of honor .
will you go to war with me , brother ?
i always thought my brother' s wife was a foolish woman ... ... but she' s proved to be very useful .
the trojans have never been conquered .
some say they can' t be conquered .
old king priam thinks he' s untouchable behind his high walls .
he thinks the sun god will protect him .
but the gods protect only ... ... the strong !
if troy falls ... ... i control the aegean .
hector commands the finest army in the east .
i' il attack them with the greatest force the world has ever seen .
i want all the kings of greece and their armies .
send emissaries in the morning .
one last thing .
we need achilles and his myrmidons .
achilles .
he can' t be controlled .
he' s as likely to fight us as the trojans .
we don' t need to control him , we need to unleash him .
that man was born to end lives .
yes , he' s a gifted killer .
but he threatens everything i' ve built .
before me , greece was nothing .
i brought all the greek kingdoms together .
i created a nation out of fire worshipers and snake eaters !
i build the future , nestor .
me !
achilles is the past .
a man who fights for no flag .
a man loyal to no country .
how many battles have we won off the edge of his sword ?
this will be the greatest war the world has ever seen .
we need the greatest warrior .
there' s only one man he' il listen to .
never hesitate .
nervous ?
petrified .
you told me never to change sword hands .
yes .
when you know how to use it , you won' t be taking my orders .
your reputation for hospitality is fast becoming legend .
patroclus , my cousin .
odysseus , king of lthaca .
patroclus .
i knew your parents well .
i miss them .
now you have this one watching over you , eh ?
learning from achilles himself .
kings would kill for the honor .
are you here at agamemnon' s bidding ?
we need to talk .
i will not fight for him .
i' m not asking you to fight for him .
i' m asking you to fight for the greeks .
are the greeks tired of fighting each other ?
for now .
the trojans never harmed me .
they insulted greece .
they insulted a man who couldn' t hold on to his wife .
is that my business ?
your business is war , my friend .
is it ?
the man has no honor .
let achilles fight for honor .
let agamemnon fight for power .
and let the gods decide which man to glorify .
for the greeks !
forget agamemnon .
fight for me .
my wife will feel much better if she knows you' re by my side .
i' il feel much better .
we' re sending the largest fleet that ever sailed .
a thousand ships .
prince hector .
is he as good a warrior as they say ?
the best of all the trojans .
some say he' s better than all the greeks too .
even if your cousin doesn' t come ... ... i hope you' il join us .
we could use a strong arm like yours .
play your tricks on me , but not my cousin .
you have your swords .
i have my tricks .
we play with the toys the gods give us .
we sail for troy in three days .
this war will never be forgotten .
nor will the heroes who fight in it .
i knew they would come for you .
long before you were born ... ... i knew they would come .
they want you to fight in troy .
i' m making you another seashell necklace .
like the ones i made you when you were a boy .
do you remember ?
mother ... ... tonight , i decide .
if you stay in lrisa ... ... you will find peace .
you will find a wonderful woman .
you will have sons and daughters , and they will have children .
and they will love you .
when you are gone , they will remember you .
but when your children are dead and their children after them ... ... your name will be lost .
if you go to troy ... ... glory will be yours .
they will write stories about your victories for thousands of years .
the world will remember your name .
but if you go to troy ... ... you will never come home .
for your glory walks hand in hand with your doom .
and i shall never see you again .
my son .
father .
paris .
father .
this is helen .
helen ?
helen of sparta ?
helen of troy .
i' ve heard rumors of your beauty .
for once ... ... the gossips were right .
welcome .
come , you must be tired .
look .
he' s grown .
he is strong .
briseis !
paris !
beloved cousin , your beauty grows with each new moon .
briseis .
a servant of apollo now .
the young men of troy were devastated when briseis chose the virgin robes .
father ... ... i know this is the last thing we need .
it is the will of the gods .
everything is in their hands .
but i' m surprised you let him bring her .
lf i' d let him fight menelaus for her ... ... you' d be burning a son' s body , not welcoming a daughter .
we could send peace envoys to menelaus .
you know menelaus .
he' d spear their heads to his gate .
what would you have me do ?
put her on a ship and send her home .
women have always loved paris , and he has loved them back .
but this is different .
something has changed in him .
if we send her home to menelaus , he will follow her .
this is my country , and these are my countrymen .
i don' t want to see them suffer so my brother can have his prize .
it' s not just the spartans coming after her .
by now , menelaus has gone to agamemnon .
and agamemnon has wanted to destroy us for years .
enemies have been attacking us for centuries .
our walls still stand .
father , we can' t win this war .
apollo watches over us .
even agamemnon is no match for the gods .
and how many battalions does the sun god command ?
do not mock the gods .
they' re coming for me .
the wind is bringing them closer .
what if we left ?
tonight .
right now .
what if we went down to the stables , took two horses and left ?
ride east , keep riding .
and go where ?
away from here .
i could hunt deer , rabbit .
i could feed us .
but this is your home .
you left your home for me .
sparta was never my home .
my parents sent my there when i was 16 to marry menelaus .
but it was never my home .
we' il live off the land .
no more palaces for us .
no more servants .
we don' t need any of that .
and your family ?
we' d be protecting my family .
if we' re not here , what' s the need for war ?
menelaus won' t give up .
he' il track us to the end of the world .
he doesn' t know these lands .
i do .
we can lose ourselves in a day .
you don' t know menelaus .
you don' t know his brother .
they' il burn every house in troy to find us .
they' il never believe we' ve left .
and even if they do , they' il burn it for spite .
then i' il make it easy for him to find me .
i' il walk right up to him and tell him you' re mine .
you' re very young , my love .
look at that .
take up your positions !
my lord ?
should we wait for the others ?
they brought us here for war .
yes , but agamemnon' s orders ...
you fight for me , eudorus , or agamemnon ?
for you , my lord .
then fight for me .
and let the servants of agamemnon fight for him .
black sail .
it' s achilles .
what' s the fool doing ?
he' s going to take the beach of troy with 50 men ?
make way there !
make way !
tecton , is the apollonian guard ready ?
waiting at the city gates .
good .
i' il be right there .
lysander , how long before the army is ready ?
half of our men are still coming .
we have to arm them ...
how long ?
noon .
make it sooner .
patroclus !
put down your spear .
i' m fighting the trojans .
not today .
i' m ready .
you taught me how to fight .
and you' re a good student .
but you' re not a myrmidon yet .
look at these men .
they are the fiercest soldiers in all of greece .
each of them has bled for me .
guard the ship .
but this is a war .
cousin , i can' t fight the trojans if i' m concerned for you .
guard the ship .
trojans !
all my life , i' ve lived by a code .
honor the gods , love your woman ... ... and defend your country .
troy is mother to us all .
fight for her !
myrmidons ... ... my brothers of the sword .
i' d rather fight beside you than any army of thousands .
let no man forget how menacing we are .
we are lions !
do you know what' s there , waiting , beyond that beach ?
lmmortality !
take it !
it' s yours !
fight positions !
archers !
forward !
the man wants to die .
on my command !
break off !
break off !
look at him .
look .
row , you lazy whores , row !
greeks are dying !
row !
those men down there need help .
now !
tecton , with me .
flank !
to the flank !
achilles !
achilles !
back to the city !
back to the city !
the sun god is a patron of troy , our enemy .
take whatever treasure you can find .
with your permission , my lord .
speak .
apollo sees everything .
perhaps it is not wise to offend him .
warn the men .
wait .
you are very brave or very stupid to come after me alone .
you must be hector .
do you know who i am ?
these priests weren' t armed .
fight me !
why kill you now , prince of troy ... ... with no one here to see you fall ?
why did you come here ?
they' il be talking about this war for 1000 years .
in 1000 years , the dust from our bones will be gone .
yes , prince .
but our names will remain .
go home , prince .
drink some wine , make love to your wife .
tomorrow , we' il have our war .
you speak of war as if it' s a game .
how many wives wait at troy' s gates for husbands they' il never see again ?
your brother can comfort them .
i hear he' s good at charming other men' s wives .
my lord , you let him go ?
it' s too early in the day for killing princes .
achilles !
achilles !
achilles .
ajax .
you' re as fearless as the gods .
i' m honored to go to war with you .
as am i.
if you sailed slower , the war would be over .
i' il miss the start as long as i' m here at the end .
i' ve got something to show you .
the men found her hiding in the temple .
they thought she' d ... ... amuse you .
what' s your name ?
did you not hear me ?
you killed apollo' s priests .
i' ve killed men in five countries , never a priest .
well , then your men did .
the sun god will have his vengeance .
what' s he waiting for ?
the right time to strike .
his priests are dead , and his acolyte' s a captive .
i think your god is afraid of me .
afraid ?
apollo is master of the sun .
he fears nothing .
where is he ?
you' re nothing but a killer !
you wouldn' t know anything about the gods .
i know more about the gods than your priests .
i' ve seen them .
you' re royalty , aren' t you ?
spent years talking down to men .
you must be royalty .
what' s your name ?
even the servants of apollo have names .
briseis .
are you afraid , briseis ?
should i be ?
my lord .
agamemnon requests your presence .
the kings are gathering to celebrate the victory .
you fought well today .
my lord .
what do you want here in troy ?
you didn' t come for the spartan queen .
i want what all men want .
i just want it more .
you don' t need to fear me , girl .
you' re the only trojan who can say that .
you have won a great victory , my king of kings .
no one thought the trojan beach could be captured so easily .
a beautiful gift , triopas .
you will be among the first to walk in the streets of troy tomorrow .
my father , neleus , had this urn made to commemorate his victory at cyparisseis .
i present it to you ... ... in honor of an even more memorable victory .
thank you , old friend .
tomorrow , we' il eat supper in the gardens of troy .
leave us .
war is young men dying and old men talking .
you know this .
ignore the politics .
apparently , you won some great victory .
perhaps you didn' t notice .
the trojan beach belonged to priam in the morning .
it belongs to agamemnon in the afternoon .
have the beach .
i didn' t come here for sand .
no .
you came here because you want your name to last through the ages .
a great victory was won today .
but that victory is not yours .
kings did not kneel to achilles .
kings did not pay homage to achilles .
perhaps the kings were too far behind to see .
soldiers won the battle .
history remembers kings !
not soldiers .
tomorrow , we' il batter down the gates of troy .
i' il build monuments on every island of greece .
i' il carve " agamemnon " in the stone .
be careful , king of kings .
first , you need the victory .
your men sacked the temple of apollo , yes ?
you want gold ?
take it .
it' s my gift to honor your courage .
take what you wish .
i already have .
aphareus !
haemon !
the spoils of war .
no argument wit you , but if you don' t release her , you' il never see home again .
decide .
guards !
stop !
too many men have died today .
if killing is your only talent , that' s your curse .
i don' t want anyone dying for me .
mighty achilles , silenced by a slave girl .
tonight , i' il have her give me a bath .
and then ... ... who knows ?
you sack of wine !
before my time is done , i will look down on your corpse and smile .
if they want a war , we will give them a war .
i would match the best of troy against the best of greece any day .
the best of greece outnumber the best of troy two to one .
glaucus .
you have fought with me for 40 years .
can we win this war ?
our walls have never been breached .
we have the finest archers in the world .
and we have hector .
yes , we can win .
i spoke to two farmers today .
they saw an eagle flying with a serpent clutched in its talons .
this is a sign from apollo .
we will win a great victory tomorrow .
bird signs .
you want to plan a strategy based on bird signs .
hector , show respect .
the high priest is a servant of the gods .
and i am a servant of troy .
i' ve always honored the gods , father .
but today i fought a greek who desecrated the statue of apollo .
apollo didn' t strike the man down .
the gods won' t fight this war for us .
there won' t be a war .
this is not a conflict of nations .
it is a dispute between two men .
i don' t want to see another trojan die because of me .
paris .
tomorrow morning , i will challenge menelaus for the right to helen .
the winner will take her home .
the loser will burn before nightfall .
father ... ... i' m sorry for the pain i' ve caused you .
do you love her ?
you are a great king because you love your country so much .
every blade of grass .
every grain of sand .
every rock in the river .
you love all of troy .
that is the way i love helen .
i' ve fought many wars in my time .
some were fought for land , some for power , some for glory .
i suppose fighting for love makes more sense than all the rest .
but i won' t be the one fighting .
the sword of troy .
my father carried this sword , and his father before him ... ... all the way back to the founding of troy .
the history of our people was written with this sword .
carry it with you tomorrow .
the spirit of troy is in that sword .
so long as a trojan carries it ... ... our people have a future .
the man who killed tecton outside apollo' s temple ... ... i' ve never seen a spear thrown like that .
an impossible throw .
don' t go tomorrow .
please don' t go .
paris fights tomorrow , not me .
fifty thousand greeks didn' t cross the sea to watch your brother fight .
you know this .
you' d make a fine general , my love .
you' ve been fighting your whole life .
let other men do battle this time .
you know i don' t want to fight .
i want to see my son grow tall .
i want to see the girls chasing after him .
i can' t lose you .
i won' t survive .
i must see paris .
wait .
wait !
helen , what are you doing ?
let me go .
no .
i saw them burn .
i saw them burning on the pyres .
that' s my fault .
it is .
you know it is .
all those widows .
i still hear them screaming .
their husbands died because i' m here .
i' m going down to the ships .
no , you' re not .
i' m giving myself back to menelaus .
it' s too late for that .
do you think agamemnon cares about his brother' s marriage ?
this is about power .
not love .
paris is going to fight in the morning .
yes .
menelaus will kill him .
i won' t let that happen .
it' s his decision .
no .
i can' t ask anyone to fight for me .
i' m no longer queen of sparta .
you' re a princess of troy now ... ... and my brother needs you tonight .
my lord .
my lord , the army is marching .
let them march .
we stay .
but the men are ready .
we stay till agamemnon groans to have achilles back .
as you wish .
are you ready to fight ?
are you ready to kill ?
to take life ?
i am .
at night , i see their faces , all the men i' ve killed .
they' re standing there on the far bank of the river styx .
they' re waiting for me .
they say , " welcome , brother .
we men are wretched things .
i taught you how to fight , but i never taught you why to fight .
i fight for you .
who will you fight for when i' m gone ?
soldiers , they fight for kings they' ve never even met .
they do what they' re told , die when they' re told to .
soldiers obey .
don' t waste your life following some fool' s orders .
go .
are you sure you want to do this ?
i started this war .
helen ... ... sit with me .
prepare to halt !
prepare to halt !
halt !
move .
i see you' re not hiding behind your high walls .
valiant of you .
ill advised , but valiant .
you come here uninvited .
go back to your ships and go home .
we' ve come too far , prince hector .
prince ?
what prince ?
what son of a king would accept a man' s hospitality ... ... eat his food , drink his wine , then steal his wife in the middle of the night ?
the sun was shining when your wife left you .
she' s up there , watching , isn' t she ?
good .
i want her to watch you die .
not yet , brother .
look around you , hector .
i brought all the warriors of greece to your shores .
you can still save troy , young prince .
i have two wishes .
if you grant them , no more of your people need die .
first , you must give helen back to my brother .
second , troy must submit to my command ... ... to fight for me whenever i call .
you want me to look upon your army and tremble ?
well , i see them .
i see 50, 000 men brought here to fight for one man' s greed .
careful , boy .
my mercy has limits .
and i' ve seen the limits of your mercy .
and i tell you now , no son of troy will ever submit to a foreign ruler .
then every son of troy shall die .
there is another way .
i love helen .
i won' t give her up and neither will you .
so let us fight our own battle .
the winner takes helen home .
and let that be the end of it .
a brave offer , but not enough .
let me kill this little peacock .
i didn' t come here for your pretty wife .
i came here for troy .
i came for my honor .
his every breath insults me .
let me kill him .
when he' s lying in the dust , signal to attack .
you' il have your city .
i' il have my revenge .
so be it .
i accept your challenge .
and tonight , i' il drink to your bones .
my lord .
back to the line !
make him swing and miss .
he' il tire .
brother ... ... if i fall , tell helen ...
tell her ...
i will .
don' t let menelaus hurt her .
if he ...
you think of your sword and his sword and nothing else .
get up .
come on .
