from her new album on martha records , that was amy cook singing ' million holes in heaven ' .
and i am alice pieszecki , and you' re listening to the chart on kcrw welcome back ...
today on the chart we' re looking at ... how do you end a vicious psycho .
ooh , and for those of you out there in radioland who are sick of hearing me rant about my ex , dana , you' il be happy to know this is not about her .
this continuum of connectedness is about the cause and effect ... of one psychotropic drug after another to the point where you' re medicating your medication .
why don' t we start with ... the very first anti depressive i tried .
it made me just a little intense .
so , then i said to my doctor ... can you just give me somethingh strong , really strong , that will just make me happy , is that too much to ask ?
so he gave me lithium .
so that one really just made me haculinate that i was happy .
did you change your hair ?
then , the ... a ... the withdrawal from those two drugs gave her a. d. d.
so , i got the a. d. d. drug .
you know the one .
i snort mine ...
do you snort yours ?
gurber munster wrote me prescription for the new ssri which he highly recommends , but said under rare cases may cause me to commit suicide .
so i was a little scared to take those ...
which meant i wasn' t on anything ...
which meant i actually felt like having sex again .
which ...
really made me want to kill myself .
how long ago did you first notice it ?
umm ... just few weeks ago .
ok
actually i probably noticed it before that but i kinda ran away ...
so
i do have a rash ... if you could look ... take a look at it .
ah i bet that' s from your sport' s bra yeah ...
then i could give you a little hydric cortizone cream to help sews it .
but is there any history of breasts cancer in your family ?
not that i know of .
you really should find out dana , are your parents still alive ?
yes , still alive , still together .
great so ask your mum for a history of your family .
ok ? ' cause it' s just ... you know good thinghs to know .
so , have there been any changes in the color or texture of your breasts ?
no
and any discharge from the nipple ?
um no
ok up you get
usually these little cysts are benin , a lot of women just have lumpy breasts .
i do , i have fibrous breasts .
it' s pretty gross .
it' s perfectly normal ... and i' m just checking your lymph nodes here .
especially in women your age ,
it' s not like there is anythingh to be too concerned about .
let' s check the other side for you .
ok
the lymph nodes are a little swollen but that could be from anything , the cold , even brushing your teeth too hard .
i' m a super hard theeth brusher .
well you' re too young dana to start getting mammograms on a regular bases .
but i' d like to do one , just to make sure everything is allright .
so , i am going to send you down to radiation .
and you just take that with you .
fuck ...
fuck .
oh , hi ruth , how are ya ?
27 , alice .
27 ... 27 , what do you mean ?
that the number of times , that you mentioned dana ... in this broadcast , which is down from 43 in the previous show .
see , what i tell you , i' m practically over her .
i could fired you right now .
you could ?
but i am not going to .
i am gonna give you one more chance .
but , i need to know in advance what your topics are gonna be .
and i' d like to see your script .
yes , i' d like to see your script , i need to see your script , and which the letters d. a followed by n. a are nowhere in evidence .
how about that ?
o k
ok
you look good ...
in that orange .
ok come closer .
come on , take your breast , come on .
like this ?
place it on the lower plate .
that' s good .
like this .
allright
and then i' m gonna lower the upper plate
ok
now maybe ... a little unconfortable ... but it' il only last for a few seconds .
it' s allright , i' m a hard ass ... a hard boob .
hold your breast ok
this is kcrw santa monica at 89 . 9 , music and mpr news , morning , noon and night .
don' t forget to listen to chart with alice pieszecki thursday afternoon at 3 o' clock .
daaannnnnnaaaa .
excuse me .
excuse me sorry , would you mind turning it off ?
thanks
god ... that show is so funny .
alice pieszecki , the host is completely falling appart because her girlfriend left her .
the girlfriend just seems like this complete nitwit ... and you don' t know why alice is so obsessed with her in a first place .
do you have any idea why this is taking so long ?
dana farebanks .
the doctor wilson is waiting for you in her office .
you can go back upstairs .
ok thanks .
byred it sounds like a personnal add from my ex girlfriend .
right , well a byred 4 is a diagnostic assessment . no this suspicious mass dana could be absolutly nothing .
it could be what we call a fibro adenoma . farbbb .... blaaaa head muma , what ?
i got soya bean pods in my boobs ?
it' s a benin solid lump .
but with the byred 4 we' re going to do a biospy .
now i can get you in for that tomorrow with doctor shapeero .
i' m suppose to go out to dinner tonight .
you go out ahead , i mean ...
just do exactly as you were planning to do because this is not a diagnosis ... and with biopsys in pre menoposal women , they' re mostly benin .
so it' s ...
it' s probably nothing ... right
but ... we gonna find out for sure .
but try not to think about it tonight allright ?
yeah sure i can do that ...
yeah .
is she asleep ?
uh ? ...
um ... in her bed .
how was your lunch with helena ?
it' s fine .
are you hidding a book in that magazine ?
it' s .... um ...
mark epstein talked about it in his lecture last week ...
it' s
she a buddhist philosopher , pema chodron .
how cute ... she looks like a wookie .
actually there are a lot in there that ... reminded me of you ...
' we work on ourselves in order to help others but we also help others in order to work on ourselves . '
i don' t know about that ...
i mean , the people i work with , they' re truly selfless .
oh no no .
i don' t think she meant it the way that you' re taking it .
that' s ... um ...
oh actually , there is another passage that ... that reminded me of me ...
i ...
' feeling irritated , restless , affraid , and hopeless , is a reminder to listen more carefully . '
i' m gonna go feed her , if we' re gonna go to this jenny dinner .
um ...
would you call angus ...
and ...
make sure he' s on his way ?
helena peabody offered me a job .
so are you considering it ?
i don' t know yet ...
somebody in this family' s gotta make a living .
i have made a living for the last 15 years ,
i don' t think my ability to make a living is really in question .
i' m not questionning your ability , i' m questionning your desire .
i thought you hated the movie business ?
there is a lot i hate about the movie business ...
i definitely haven' t said yes ... but she made it very attractive .
so then there' s ... no reasons that i ... should feel ... threatenend or ...
no ... there' s nothing between us anymore , nothing at all .

i' il be happy to talk you through it .

i took a ...
it' s amazing .
sea urchess .

so uh ...
dana and i , we booked our tickets to southern france , you guys , we leave on the 15th next month .
oh , fun !
we' re taking a food and wine tour .
does anybody want some of my lobster ?
what' s that sauce on it , bette ?
i think it' s lemon froth and shaved dry tuna roe .
whatever , it' s good , right ?
do you want some ...
do you want some lobster , moira ?
no i' m fine , thanks .
well , it' s not gonna bite ya .
no , i' m fine , thank you .
moira , don' t you like lobster ?
yeah , actually i like it a lot .
do you want some ?
i don' t think the claws have any sauce ...
i' m sorry i only have the tale left , but you know ...
if you want , you can have the tale and wipe the sauce off .
no that' s cool .
are you sure ?
yeah .
i know something interresting about lobsters .
what ?
you don' t have to put a lid on the pot when you cook female lobsters .
does anybody know why ?
no
when you cook a pot of male lobsters , and they realize they' re in this pot of boilling water , they all start totally freaking out .
they' re like " fuck we gotta get out of here
and they start making these little ladders , and helping each other getting out of the pot .
so you have to put a lid on the pot to keep them inside .
but female lobsters , you don' t have to put a lid on the pot .
because once they realize they' re in a pot of boilling water ,
they all just start grabbing each other and they' re like holding each other down .
if i' m gonna die , everyone' s gonna die .
and none of them' s want to let any of the others get out of the pot .
it' s a real shame , isn' t it ?
whaou .
these crazy female lobsters ...
just get yourself down !
jenny , i' m just gonna go .
you' il get a ride home from carmen and shane .
uh , will you excuse me for a second ?
moira ?
moira !
what are you doing ?
i' m just gonna go , okay ?
why ?
look , this sould cover me .
okay , i don' t understand .
did something happened , just now ?
they' re your friends , i don' t really fit in .
oh my god , moira .
they' re getting to know you and ...
that' s gonna take some time and they' re gonna think your' re fucking amazing when they get to know you .
maybe she kept jenny from felling lonely .
you know what it is , when you' re ... with someone that' s completly wrong for you .
just because you don' t wanna be alone .
i don' t know , maybe she' s jenny' s type .
oh yeah !
' cause carmen' s such a stone butch too .
i wouldn' t certainly call moira stone butch .
allright and what wold you describe her as ?
miss " hi , let us butches help you ladies out with your luggage " ?
right ?
she comes from a place where ... you know , you have to define yourself as either or
it' s probably the other language that she has to describe herself .
she has the language of the " chick kicking boobs " and that lumberjack walk .
i' m just surprised that she wanted to roleplay like that .
especially after everything that jenny' s been through .
well , she could be completly different in the bedroom .
maybe she' s " butch in the streets and femmme in the sheets
oh my god , that' s so original .
you know what , what difference does that make whether someone is butch or femme ?
leave the labels alone , just let people be who they are .
right .
what do you guys thought of that lobster thing anyway ?
oh come on !
competitive female lobsters .
it' s so not true !
is everything okay ?
yeah .
do we have dessert ?
and i love that child .
i fucked up , with my own .
oh , every parents fucks up one way or another .
no , i really fucked up .
i just left him , when he wasn' t bigger than that .
i just dumped him with his stuff with his father and old school grand parents
and went off doing my music . now i don' t really have a leg to stand on complaining about why he' s a fondamentalist bigot
what do you think about that mr. mangus ?
i think when you' re called to play music , there' s not a lot you can do about this .
sometimes , it pulls even stronger than that biological thing that bonds a mother to her child .
well , allright then .
good night , mr. mangus .
good night .
i will take that .
thanks .
oh bette , no no no no !
no yeah !
we should do the maths .
no , no no , i' ve got it .
no , really , it' s jenny' s comming home dinner and it would be my privilege .
thank you , that' s very generous of you .
that' s sweet bette .
you' re welcome .
bette , thank you .
there you are .
i just wanna talk , okay ?
i' m not gonna attack .
what do you want to talk to me about ?
i just wanna know if you' re happy .

i mean , for the most part , i' m happy .
i' m glad one of us is .

i don' t know what to do .

maybe we could be friends again one day .
i would really love that .
i miss you .
come back to me then .
alice ...

okay .
i let you wash your hands .
i know how you like to wash your hands after you go to the bathroom .
everybody likes to wash their hands after they go to the bathroom .
yeah , but it' s super cute the way you do it .
lorraine lawson
is everything okay ?
hmm hmm .

whaou .
i' m sorry ma' am , but your credit card was declined .
you' re kidding me .
i don' t know how that' s possible .
bette , no no no .
no , really , it' s not a big deal .

it' s not a big deal .
oh , i remember .
i put a ...

bette , bette ...
jenny , no , you' re still our gest of honour , no matter what .
yeah .

helena , hi , it' s tina .
i hope i' m not calling too late .
no ...
actually i' ve been thinking about your proposition .
and ...
i think i' d like to give it a try .
don' t .
hey .

no .
i' m sure she' s okay .
she' s a big girl , she can take care of herself .
i feel like such an asshole .
