welcome to hazzard county .
a little corner of the world where everyone knows everyone else ... ... and people are never too busy to stop and say howdy .
shoot , some folks even say this is where the apple pie was invented .
yep , basically everything down here moves a little bit slower ... ... unless , of course , your last name is duke .
man , the general' s in good shape .
bo , it' s happy hour at the boar' s nest , and we still got two deliveries to make .
it' s all one big happy hour , luke .
besides , we' re taking a shortcut .

but then it hit me .
life is like a racetrack .
you gotta keep going round and round .
that is so true .

but if you don' t make the turn , you ain' t never gonna learn .
so i gripped the wheel tighter , checked my gauges , and made my move .

just once you two ought to try leaving a place ... ... in better shape than it was when you walked in .
oh , i think your boss can afford to replace a few broken beer mugs .
i heard there was a little incident earlier ... ... concerning a certain crappy orange hot rod out at the miller farm .
y' all really upset some of them construction boys .
when i got there , they were not being gentle with your beloved piece of crap .

now , why would they need to plant a still ?
because they' re too damn dumb to find our real one .
i was waiting on old bill miller up at the truck stop last night .
he said boss ' men seized his land for some trumped up charge too .
maybe it' s got to do with all that construction equipment up at the millers ' .
you wanna go up there and take a second look ?

oh , now , pauline .
don' t worry , uncle jesse .

... to race here saturday .
he' s paying him ?
y' all better get your asses back here quick as you can , got it ?
ten four , shepherd , this is lost sheep out .
what' s this ?
what' s these crackers doing in our place ?
turns out prickett came back because hogg paid him a assload of cash .
don' t mean billy has anything to do with strip mining .
you got to be kidding me .
oh , shit .
roll them up .
what the hell is this , man ?
looks like somebody' s lost .
look , a couple of white boys playing black . ls that' s what' s going on ?
actually , we were at the geology lab for some environmental stuff , and
no , i get it .
they on one of these reality shows .
who wanna get they ass kicked ?
yeah .
why don' t you two hillbillies join us up here for a minute ?
actually , we prefer appalachian americans .
man , get out the car !
now , which one of you two brothers is michelangelo ?
there' s a certain creek that people sometimes canoe up without a paddle .
you could say that the duke boys were on that particular creek right now .
let' s kick they ass , jerry !
never thought i' d say this , but , hot damn , it' s the cops .
there goes the canoe .
give me your shoelaces .
what ?
these guys over there gave me theirs .
see , i' m gonna fashion myself a lasso .
when the jailer comes in , i' m gonna rope his keys .
luke and bo duke are home free .
period , end of story .
i got on cowboy boots , cuz .
i like your style .
you gonna need those shoelaces ?
we gonna have to get out of here .
hey , yul brynner .
we gotta make a phone call .
we gotta call our lawyer .
what the hell are we in here for ?
well , where should i start ?
we know you' re gonna strip mine hazzard .
do you , now ?
well , that' s good .
guess where i' m gonna sink that first drill .
right down in the middle of your bedroom .
y' all do still share a bunk bed , right ?
hey , that' s a phat suit there .
what , you some type of pimp ?
what has strip mining got to do with you paying billy prickett to race tomorrow ?
you like magic , luke ?
sleight of hand ?
see , while you' re looking over here , something' s really happening over here .
you see , despite the fact that i now own your beloved farm ... ... l can' t legally mine it , because the county won' t let me .
i need to hold a public hearing , you know ... ... to give the citizens of hazzard a chance to object .
and let me guess , you' re going to hold the hearing during the rally tomorrow ?
and if nobody knows about the hearing , there won' t be anyone there to object .
there you go .
sleight of hand .
sleight of hand .
grow the fingernails out .
then pop some fingernail polish on them bitches .
ls billy prickett in on it ?
prickett ?
prickett' s just collecting a paycheck .
we ain' t gonna let you get away with it .
really ?
tomorrow , if you happen to be strolling by the courthouse about noon ... ... you might wanna rush right in there and voice your objections .
voice this .
dadgum it .
i just remembered .
tomorrow morning you' re going to the georgia work farm .
and i hear they have a rather strict policy on weekend passes .
yo , b. you need to pop a feather in that hat , yo .
then your man ho' s will be having more respect for you .
i have $ 1 00 right here ... ... for whoever knocks that loudmouth son of a bitch out .
thank you .
now , break some rocks for me , boys .
take care , now , you hear ?
bye bye .
don' t you know you' re not supposed to wear white after labor day ?
all right , here' s what we' re gonna do .
when we stop for gas , we call up cooter and tell him to put a pig in the road , right .
then when the cops are moving the pig , cooter hooks up a cable to the bumper .
car drives away , the hook will pull out the whole chassis .
he can' t drive without a chassis
all right , shut up back there !
my cousin' s starting to go crazy .
we gotta get him to a hospital .
i think he done caught the fever , or something .
that' s what happens when you' re humping livestock , hillbilly .
can we help you guys out with anything up there ... ... oblige you with a reach around or something ?
of course , you' d have to un cuff us first .
sarge , if you and me was to have a chase , you think you could catch me ?
appears to me you caught already , son .
i' m serious .
lf i had my car and you was in this one , you really think you could catch me ?
because , bubba , this car feels kind of slow to me .
she' s got plenty under the hood , don' t you worry about that .

because your taillight is out , and we couldn' t see you brake .
you' re gonna write me a ticket ?
yep .
