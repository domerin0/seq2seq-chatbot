castlegard .
clear !
250 .
250 ready .
clear !
300 .
300 ready .
clear !
he' s gone .
it' s over 100 degrees out there .
he grabs me with ice cold hands .
apart from external wounds , everything is out of alignment .
even his veins are out of alignment .
now , wait .
look at the heart .
the aorta doesn' t line up .
and now the spine .
same thing .
same shift right across the third vertebrae .
this guy looks like a paper doll got cut up and pasted back together .
no wallet .
no id .
just this thing around his neck .
it says itc on it , so we called them .
that outfit in the desert .
our biggest contributors .
excuse me , gentlemen .
frank gordon , itc .
i' m here to pick up vince taub' s body .
i' m dr. cova , i' il take care of that paperwork .
thank you .
vincent taub , huh ?
that' s vinnie' s good luck charm .
thank you .
pretty sad when your time comes and no one claims you but your employer .
excuse me , sheriff .
sure .
gordon .
i' m picking up the body right now .
was he alone or with decker ?
taub' s the only one here .
get the body out of there .
and x rays and records .
get everything , ok ?
will it be a problem ?
no , there' s no problem .
they' ve been very accommodating .
if this gets out , itc is ruined .
any idea how he ended up in the desert ?
i don' t know .
maybe he used his marker without enough clearance .
it could be a million things .
not too bright .
he' s dead , robert .
taub is dead .
oh , mr. gordon , by the way , what' s castlegard ?
i heard that' s the only word he said , " castlegard " .
sounds like an amusement park .
listen up , class , april 4 , 1357 , castlegard , france .
the english army in their red uniforms occupied the village of castlegard .
the french , meanwhile , were advancing . trying to drive them out of there , in this direction over the river , past the monastery and up and over to the heights here .
just leave it , chris , that' s fine , before you wreck the place .
the english army , meanwhile , had retreated to castle la roque .
well fortified , very strong , very well supplied , and both sides had settled in for a long siege .
the french were trying to push the english out of france .
lord oliver tries to take the fight out of the french .
now , he has a prisoner , a woman .
a woman of class and a woman of nobility .
commander arnaut' s sister , lady claire .
he hangs her from the battlements for all of the french forces to see .
instead of demoralizing the french , it whips them into a frenzy , and they attack the castle like madmen , and they overpower the english with sheer passion .
so the fortress of la roque fell in one night because of the death of one woman .
lady claire .
all right , that' s enough of the academics for today .
go get your hands dirty .
hi , chris .
hey , dad , i got marek' s clippers .
oh , chris , great .
thanks .
here , hold that , will you .
you can move it around if you like .
i thought this would be a routine trip .
it is .
last time you cut off your beard , you sold the house and we moved to kentucky for a year .
your mother wanted a change .
how does this always happen to me ?
i am older and very much wiser than you , have a beer .
it' il cool you down .
very hot work , ironing .
i know something' s going on .
the beard' s coming off , so what' s really happening ?
it' s these amazing finds we' ve been making .
doniger' s been giving us too many tips .
he' s a lucky zillionaire .
nobody' s that lucky .
he knows something he' s not saying .
something isn' t right about this .
he' s been ducking me .
i' m gonna get a few answers .
maybe scrounge a couple of bucks .
put that in my bag , would you ?
and don' t wrinkle it .
i' d appreciate it if you don' t tell anybody about this .
especially kate .
why would i tell kate ?
here .
have a wee run round that , would you ?
why would i tell kate ?
you see me twice a year , stay until you' re bored to distraction .
i think the record' s three weeks .
maybe i' m just really beginning to enjoy archeology .
from a boy who hated easter because he had to find eggs .
yeah , because you buried the eggs .
that' s beside the point .
yeah , because you buried the eggs .
that' s beside the point .
you' re still here because of kate .
chris .
look , son ,
i love you , but you' re scorching my shirt .
sorry .
you and kate are from different worlds .
you saw how that turned out between your mother and me .
yeah , but , dad , no offense , i' m not like you .
but kate is .
trust me , if it' s between archeology and you , you' il lose .
sorry .
i' m sorry .
i brought you a beer .
that' s so sweet .
half a beer anyways .
half a beer .
what you got going on here ?
the stairs .
the ones you were talking about ?
where do they go ?
now they don' t go anywhere , but they' il lead me to my tunnel which will go all the way to la roque .
what do you say i help you out ?
show me what to do .
i thought you hated this stuff .
no , i don' t hate it .
let' s have a beer , i need a break .
you have the full one .
that' s sweet of you .
cheers .
cheers .
thank you .
you' re welcome .
think you' il follow in your father' s footsteps ?
no .
no .
no way .
actually , i' m not really all that interested in the past .
no ?
what are you interested in then ?
i think i already know the answer to that question .
i' ve been hoping that you' d notice .
i' ve been hoping you' d quit hoping i' d notice .
so there' s nothing there ?
chris , you are the boss ' son .
so ... there is something there .
it' s late , i' il just start on this tomorrow .
but thanks for the beer .
haven' t been practicing , have you ?
i' m not getting any younger .
you love this stuff .
it' s a habit i can' t quite kick .
let me take that from you before you cut something you' il need later .
so talking about love . how did it go last night ?
it didn' t .
so how does it feel being passed over for 600 year old ruins ?
it sucks .
it sucks big time .
i don' t understand you guys .
you live in the past .
you know what the past is to me ?
the past is why my parents split up .
the past is what i' ve been force fed since i was little .
none of you archeologists looks to the future .
what are you talking about ?
what is the future but just more of the same ?
more gadgets , more machines like that thing you rode up on .
it' s the past is where it' s at , you know .
people then , they cared about each other .
men had honor , you know ?
no , no .
you know what that is to me ?
romantic warrior crap .
romantic ?
you want to see romantic ?
follow me .
come on .
come on !
what have you got ?
oh , another stone sticking out of the ground .
no , it' s a 600 year old sarcophagus with a french knight and his lady .
look , isn' t she beautiful ?
she' s a real knockout .
very funny .
another thing , down here , they' re holding hands .
incredibly unusual for that period .
that is kind of unusual , huh ?
oh , god , over here .
this knight has only got one ear .
what happened there ?
what , one ear ?
that piece is missing .
it' s somewhere here in the dirt .
i' m the archeologist .
it was carved that way .
fair enough .
trust me .
who do you think they were ?
why would somebody that doesn' t give a shit be concerned with that ?
because i' m intrigued , all right ?
see ?
what you wanted to hear ?
yeah .
we' re all intrigued by this .
that' s why we' re all here .
it' s not just about the rocks and the rubble .
it' s about these people .
who were they ?
and what were their stories ?
it helps us to understand where we came from , or where we' re going .
you know what i like to say .
" you make your own history .
do i say it that often ?
yeah , all the time .
well , whoever they were , they made theirs together .
it' s best to go really , really slow .
it' s better to be cautious .
come on .
hurry up !
cave in at the monastery !
cave in at the monastery !
i was standing and the floor gave way underneath my feet .
how long has it been open ?
15 minutes .
we have five minutes before oxygen contamination .
let' s move it .
be careful .
it' s under where i was working .
i don' t know about this .
can everybody listen up ?
let' s be careful , we got that ?
i' ve got your back .
be safe .
who' s going in first ?
ok , let' s go .
who' s going down first ?
i am .
on belay !
on kate !
ok , take me down nice and slow .
give me a radio check .
please be careful .
ok , one two .
do you read me ?
we' re good .
that' s good .
just keep it steady .
lower kate down .
lower me down .
easy , guys .
nice and slow .
nice and slow .
i' m getting close to the first level .
easy !
bring me down , guys .
a little more on marek .
smell the stale air .
kate , be careful down there .
i' m down .
oh , my god .
this is right below where i was working .
are you all right ?
what' s going on ?
all right ? " " all right " is not the word .
one ...
give me slack on the rope .
more slack !
come on , guys .
oh , my god .
this is unbelievable .
we are the first people in this room for 600 years .
these ...
these ... ... are beautiful .
you won' t believe the condition of these ...
what have you got ?
come here .
no way .
this is too much .
oh , my god .
what is it ?
oh , my god .
an old document box .
we' ve got an oilskin with documents inside .
look at the condition of this thing !
ok , let' s be really careful .
quick , get the bag .
i can' t believe this .
that is gonna be such a find .
careful , careful , careful .
let' s get this up .
i need the light for a minute .
oh , my god .
oh , my god .
oh , man !
give me the light .
what kind of ...
it' s amazing . ... son of a bitch would deliberately damage something so beautiful ?
obviously not an archeologist .
we' ve gotta get out of here .
let' s go !
guys , we' re coming up !
pull it up !
come on !
we want to go up quick , ok ?
hold this .
what are you doing , marek ?
it' s ok .
what are you doing ?
it' s definitely a modern day bifocal lens .
i know .
and bifocals weren' t invented until the mid 1 700s .
the hole only opened up today , stern .
there' s been nobody down that chamber before kate and i.
if you think that' s weird , you' il love this .
what is this ?
one of the documents you found .
it' s just a simple list of the things stored in there .
nothing special .
and then we found this .
look .
the professor ?
help me " ?
e. a. johnston " ?
" 4/ 2/ 1357 " ?
1357 .
e. a. johnston .
what is going on ?
i cross matched the signatures .
it' s definitely his handwriting .
but he' s only been gone for two days .
your father wrote that , but he wrote it 600 years ago .
what' s going on here ?
franois is looking for his spare pair .
i' il see if the prescriptions match .
so you' re telling me this is the professor' s and it' s 600 years old ?
what have you been smoking ?
maybe you can explain .
if i knew , i' d explain it .
all i know is that the ink is 600 years old .
i know .
this is my father .
this is him .
he' s just playing a prank .
no !
no , there is no way he would risk contaminating the site as a joke .
he just wouldn' t .
did you carbon date the ink ?
of course .
there' s got to be another reason .
i did it three times .
like i just said , your father wrote that note , but he wrote it 600 years ago .
i don' t care about itc' s policies , i' m his son .
i wanna talk to him now .
i found the professor' s glasses .
they were on his desk .
it' s a perfect match , look .
we should do an optical test to make sure .
i' m sick of this .
either somebody tell me where professor johnston is or i report a kidnapping to the authorities .
have i made myself clear ?
just tell us when and where .
what is it ?
doniger' s sending a plane for us .
we' re going to new mexico ?
let' s pack up , guys .
good morning .
steven kramer , itc .
frank gordon , security .
where' s my dad ?
you' il see your dad shortly .
where' s doniger at ?
doniger' s waiting inside .
mr. kramer will explain everything .
tell me .
how come we have a 600 year old document
with his handwriting ?
pleading for help .
i' il explain as soon as we get through security .
itc is constantly advancing itself in science .
30 years ago , the business world was revolutionized with a machine that sent documents anywhere with the push of a button .
doniger' s vision was to do that with 3 d objects .
like a fax or something ?
exactly .
he' s trying to send actual objects from one place to another ?
follow me .
but that' s impossible .
he would need a quantum computer with millions of processors .
we used them to build a machine that could fax three dimensional objects .
i' il explain these mirrors later .
it would put fedex and ups out of business .
you actually made it work ?
yes .
across a room .
but we wanted to send things across continents so we built a bigger machine .
this is the prototype .
the prototype ?
so that thing that we just passed ...
exactly . ... is the real thing ?
we gave it a thousand times more power .
we tried to send something from new mexico to a twin machine at a lab in new york city .
now , here' s the interesting part .
the package never arrived at its destination .
a few hours later , it showed up back here .
wait a minute .
so if it went missing between new mexico and new york ,
where did it go in the meantime ?
we asked the same question .
so we sent out a camera over and over , and we got back photos of the same location , a hillside with trees .
that' s when mr. doniger made the brilliant decision to point the camera straight up .
so once we cross referenced star charts to the horizon , we realized that the camera was not only in the wrong place ,
but it was in the wrong time .
so , what does that mean ?
the camera was taking photographs of a wilderness near castlegard , france in the year 1357 .
so you' re saying you accidentally discovered time travel ?
no , we accidentally discovered a wormhole .
1357 , castlegard .
so you faxed my father' s glasses and documents back to the 1 4th century ?
no , chris .
your father is in the 1 4th century .
what ?
we need you to help get him back .
mr. robert doniger , this doesn' t make sense .
a wormhole is a volatile force .
you can' t send a person through one .
can' t fit a piece of paper through a telephone wire .
but you can send a fax .
sure , once you' ve broken the message into a stream of electrons , but ...
oh , shit .
now , look .
i don' t care about the hows or the whys .
i care about my father .
did he know about all this ?
i thought we could help each other .
we' d give him hints
i thought we could help each other .
we' d give him hints about the best excavation areas , and he could discover why we' re locked into this particular place and time .
so this is why you' ve been funding our dig .
he was more astute than i thought .
we gave him too many clues and he became very , very suspicious .
how could you send him there ?
god knows where he is ...
oh , he' s a very persuasive man .
he insisted on going .
now he' s stuck .
that' s where you all come in .
do we look like wormhole specialists ?
you sent the professor to the hundred years ' war ?
right .
turbulent times you sent him to .
we need cultural experts , not scientists .
my people don' t know about the medieval world or how to mingle , which is what we have to do if we are to find the professor and bring him back .
so we bring him back , it' s that simple .
we step on that machine and whiz back to 1357 to get him back ?
once he' s broken us into a stream of electrons .
why should we do what you ask us ?
i think we need to know more ...
i know you have a lot of questions ...
a lot of questions .
the professor' s already been gone for 72 hours and every minute he' s there , it' il be more difficult to find him .
that' s true .
bob ?
excuse me , i need to get them changed if they' re going to go .
frank , change with them .
i' m not going .
gomez and baretto are ready .
we need to think ...
i' d like you along .
we didn' t say we were going .
steve , can you bring them to prep , please .
sure .
folks , this way .
thank you .
please , this way .
thank you .
just follow steve .
he' il take you to the prep room .
bob , look .
gomez and baretto are my two best men .
they can handle any situation .
i would prefer not going .
i really want you to go .
and if you see decker , you know what to do .
robert ...
you know , that was a really great speech you made .
i almost believed it myself .
didn' t you forget something ?
what ?
come on .
look at taub' s mrls .
look at his arteries .
this was his tenth trip .
this is their first and only .
they deserve to know that we don' t know how he ended up in the desert .
you don' t think they deserve to know that ?
i' ve told them enough .
how did my father get stuck back there ?
doniger gave him an hour .
things got harried , and i lost him in the woods .
you left him there .
we have a limited time .
i had to come back or we' d both be stuck .
i guess it' s better him than you , right ?
listen , there' s a few things we have to go over before we leave .
they need your vital data .
it' s for your return process .
change from your clothes into those clothes over there .
anything you want .
put your personals in the lockers .
i want to introduce you to two friends .
bill baretto , jimmy gomez .
they' re coming with us .
buddies from the marines .
why do we need marines ?
just in case something goes wrong .
i like to have all my bases covered .
all right , let' s change up .
i can' t believe you' re considering this .
do you understand what it does ?
it strips you down to a molecular level . which means , for a moment , you cease to exist .
listen to him , he' s got a point .
hold on !
wait a second .
i don' t need you , miss ericson .
or chris .
i need you .
you know the layout .
nobody knows it like i do .
i go .
there' s no way i' m not going .
i just said i' m not going , so don' t touch me !
thanks .
stern , we don' t need you back there .
you' re a physicist .
your knowledge won' t help us .
i' m sorry .
but we are going to need you , franois .
why do we need him ?
because he speaks french fluently .
he' s right .
my high school french sucks .
don' t do this .
we need his help .
i' il cover you .
don' t pressure him .
franois , you have to make your own decision on this .
your father would' ve done it for me , so , yes , i' il come .
ok .
yes .
thank you .
thank you .
magnetic coils ready .
verifying now .
platform up .
computers are up , mr. doniger .
tell gordon we' ve got to get going .
keep a couple of beers cold for me , all right ?
mr. stern .
watch our backs , ok ?
it will be all right .
we' il be back before you know it .
take it easy , bro .
you know the 50 bucks i owe you ?
all right , let' s move it .
frank , six hours and the clock is running .
wear these personal markers around your neck .
you can use any one of them to call for your return .
frank will explain their intricacies once you arrive .
most importantly , one marker will bring all of you back .
do not lose them .
what about weapons ?
nothing modern goes back .
especially weapons .
they' re set for a six hour countdown .
countdown ?
they burn out after six hours .
and then ?
i' il get you back before you know it .
oh .
sorry , franois , they didn' t have these back then .
i don' t see without ...
you' il be fine .
that' s where we goofed with the professor .
i feel morally compelled to inform you that there is a degree of pain .
i' m told it' s rather intense , but extremely fleeting .
a couple of seconds .
no residual discomfort .
so forgive me .
i didn' t want that to influence your decision .
ok .
good luck .
let' s do it .
you all look great .
miss ericson , you look divine .
good luck .
don' t worry about it .
you guys will be home for lunch .
think of it as the ultimate field trip .
a fantastic thing for an archeologist .
i can' t believe we' re doing this .
slowly .
there are no railings .
josh , come on down .
come watch .
josh , come on down .
come watch .
yeah , i' m fine .
take a place around the perimeter .
spread out .
move around the platform .
take a deep breath , relax .
we' il be back before you know it .
are we set ?
all systems check .
come in , josh .
close the door .
good luck .
six hours and counting .
mr. marek ?
mr. marek .
i need you to take your position .
how' s everybody doing ?
what the hell are we doing ?
getting the chance of a lifetime .
nothing to worry about .
we' il take care of you .
just relax .
everything will be fine .
dna streams locked in .
thank you .
ok , lock them in .
locking in .
how long does it take ?
a couple of seconds .
watch it here .
mirrors locked .
son of a ...
where is he ?
franois !
are you all right ?
where' s franois ?
franois ?
there he is !
franois !
pull him out !
now we wait .
give me your hand !
come on !
franois , hold on !
hold on !
hold on !
here , take my hand .
you all right ?
you all right ?
everybody all right ?
that was a close one .
all right .
let' s head up this hill .
everybody follow me up .
hell of a start .
we' ve always arrived on land .
gordon , is this it ?
i think so .
you think so ?
are we in 1357 france ?
this could be oregon .
gordon , where are we ?
shut up !
trust me , we' re in 1357 france .
well , if this is france .
i' m home .
come on , let' s go .
let me explain the markers .
press here , it shows the remaining time .
squeeze it , it takes you home .
but don' t .
why ?
we haven' t found his dad yet .
one last thing ...
he said , " hide " .
everyone hide .
all right , take cover .
let' s go !
move !
now !
franois , come on !
well done , sir de kere .
after him .
yes , my lord .
get the others .
find out who they are .
come on , quick .
oh , god !
baretto !
we got a field buck !
they' re coming back !
oh , my god .
get a medic !
get a medic up here !
what was that ?
what was that ?
what ?
what is that ?
that' s a grenade !
get down !
oh , my god , he' s left .
get down !
he' il see you !
you !
over here !
let' s go .
come on , come on !
all right , let' s go .
come on , chris !
kate !
marek !
hey .
where' s my boys ?
where' s marek ?
the guys came after baretto .
he took some arrows and then he pressed his marker .
he' s gone .
he took two arrows , and he must have hit his marker .
where' s gomez ?
i didn' t see him .
oh , my god .
don' t look .
what are you doing ?
oh , shit , i can' t find his marker .
you' re looking for his marker ?
he' s dead !
what are you doing ?
i' m getting us out of here .
we' re not going anywhere .
we can' t save anyone if we' re dead !
keep it quiet .
you can' t do that .
why not ? !
you need 40 feet of clearance around all sides to work .
what ?
i was trying to tell you .
don' t lose these .
they' re precious .
and if you follow my lead , i will get your dad and get you home .
franois , it' s going to be ok .
let' s find marek .
what about gomez ?
we can' t do anything about him now .
we gotta go .
look at me .
franois , come on .
be quiet !
the soldiers !
you passed us .
you passed us in the woods .
it' s ok .
it' s ok .
we' ve lost the trail .
damn it .
pick it up again .
yes , sir de kere .
search down by the river .
jesus , you' re a girl .
it' s ok .
after the french bastards !
after them !
leave none living !
careful .
there you are .
no .
help !
help !
shut it off !
he knew not to take anything modern .
that son of a bitch brought a grenade back with him .
i can' t believe it .
the coils .
the coils .
damn it !
he knew the regulations , no modern weapons !
gomez ?
the lines are online !
well ...
his marker .
what happened to the rest of them ?
get a medic over here !
i don' t know .
give me your gloves .
well , did anyone try to come back with him ?
i don' t know .
i know as much as you , ok ?
hang on .
what if they' re trying to come back now ?
it' s not gonna happen ...
don' t jump to conclusions .
you can' t leave seven people stuck back there !
tell me you have a backup plan ...
shut up !
i don' t know .
i don' t know .
please tell me you have a backup plan .
yes , we have a backup plan .
go !
gordon !
gordon !
it' s marek !
chris !
this frenchwoman will lead us to castlegard .
great .
that' s great .
let' s go .
come on .
wow .
the village of castlegard .
we' re here .
where is everyone going ?
hold on a second .
what day is this ?
marek ...
it' s the fourth of april .
of course it is .
it' s april 4th .
1357 .
the day la roque falls ?
wait , wait .
what are you talking about ?
you son of a bitch ,
excuse me ?
you brought us back on the day the french attack .
by tonight , this whole place is gonna be burned to the ground .
stop with the history and look for the professor .
now , follow me .
let' s go .
i' m a physicist .
give me something to do .
i can help .
might as well be a pharmacist .
good one , robert .
replacement panels are on their way .
how long will this take ?
five hours and 27 minutes .
how do you know it' s gonna take 5 hours and 27 minutes ?
because that' s all the time we have .
once this platform is fixed , even if the markers run out , we can send someone back to get them ?
the thing holding the wormhole open is their markers .
but you' ve opened and closed it dozens of times .
once the platform ...
look , we don' t even know what we did to link us to this wormhole .
a lucky calibration , chance impurity in the coils .
the point is , the grenade probably destroyed any possibility of re creating it .
once their markers expire , they could be stuck there forever ?
is that what you' re saying ?
they could be .
guys , come on .
come on , come on .

we captured them in the village .
i am lord oliver .
who speaks for you ?
i do , my lord .
you speak strangely .
yes , we are scottish , my lord .
scottish ?
you' ve come to kill us all in our beds ?
first the old man and now this group .
why do the scottish find this village so pleasing ?
it must be your lord' s kind manners .
indeed it must .
my lady .
i beg your pardon , my lord .
let him speak .
my lord , the old man you spoke of ...
edward de johnness ?
he claims he' s a magister .
do you know of him ?
he' s our master , sir .
all is well with him ?
he said he was alone .
we were several days behind him .
he does not know we are here .
who are you ?
yes , you .
the one whose head is touching the ceiling .
franois , my lord .
a frenchman .
hold .
please .
please .
we' re all gentlemen here .
he' s our interpreter , sir .
forgive them .
i' m at war with the french , as well as the scottish .
have i forgotten anyone ?
the spaniards , am i at war with them ?
arnaut has sent many spies into my midst .
no , he' s not a spy .
no ?
he' s our friend .
i' m sure he is .
he' s too tall to be a spy , anyway .
interpret .
be quiet .
interpret .
i' m a spy .
i' m sorry .
i didn' t quite catch that .
it means ...
be quiet , franois .
... i am a spy .
my god , it' s a miracle .
a quiet frenchman .
did you hear that ?
no .
louder , boy !
come on !
i am a spy .
i thought so .
oh , my god !
get rid of the frenchman .
put them with the old man .
we may need them .

i' m moving !
over here , andre .
this way .
come on .
my marker .
guys , i lost my marker !
don' t worry , we only need one marker to get home , ok ?
this can' t be happening .
careful with the rest .
those bastards killed franois .
professor .
professor !
kate ?
yeah .
kate .
oh , my god , kate .
are you all right ?
oh , my god .
you got my message .
chris , your dad .
chris is here and marek' s here .
dad ?
son .
dad .
chris , my son .
glad you' re still alive .
oh , god .
what happened ?
you' ve lost such blood .
it' s not my blood .
it' s franois ' .
he' s dead .
oliver had him killed because he' s french .
this guy had a sword and he just ran him through .
professor , what happened ?
i was trying to avoid the english , but they found me in the monastery .
i convinced oliver i was a magister on my way to dublin .
i skipped shakespeare .
what is a magister ?
it' s a scientist .
he accused me of being a spy .
how did you survive that ?
i promised oliver a new weapon .
what kind of weapon ?
a liquid fire so intense that even water couldn' t harm it .
greek fire ?
you promised him greek fire ?
professor .
i' m sorry , have you considered what you may have done ?
you' ve given the english a serious advantage in this battle .
they' re supposed to lose the war !
i was alone !
marek .
marek !
i' m sorry .
i' m sorry .
you' re right .
the point is , when these guys come here , and take us up to la roque . when they seal that place off for battle , there is no escape .
we' re as good as dead .
no , we gotta get out of here now .
wait , wait , wait .
remember that field where the peasant huts were ?
that' s the closest place with enough room to use the marker .
how do we get there ?
we have to do it fast .
we' ve got four hours .
four hours is plenty .
the way i see it , we' ve got 650 years of knowledge on these guys .
there' s no reason why we shouldn' t be able to get home in 20 minutes .
ok , let' s find a way out .
let' s look around .
there' s a hole here big enough to climb through .
quiet !
ok , all right .
she was with the group we caught earlier , my lord .
may i ask why you' re trespassing on my land ?
come , come .
what are you doing ?
i' m gonna scale down the wall .
when it' s clear , i' m gonna let you guys out .
all right .
you' re not going anywhere .
what ?
i am , i' m ...
marek , i' m the best climber , i am the best climber .
if anyone should be going , it should be me , but those roof slats won' t hold me , or you , or you , chris .
no , no ...
wait .
wait .
but they might hold you , kate .
now , kate , this isn' t a game .
are you prepared to take a life ?
i' il do what i have to do .
there' s no way .
you' re not going anywhere .
it' s going to be all right , ok ?
there' s one thing worse than dying here , and that' s living here .
i refuse to do either .
i' m going .
it' s ok .
she' s right .
kate .
please , please take care .
hey , it' s easy .
it' s gonna be easy .

or follow me .
let' s go !

we have a field buck .
somebody' s trying to come back .

search the huts !
search everywhere and capture them !
oh , by the way , my name' s andre marek .
castlegard was your village , wasn' t it ?
don' t worry , you' il return there soon .
no .
the english will burn it to the ground before they move to la roque .
no , la roque will fall too .
yes .
but it will take many more lives and many months of fighting before it happens .
the french built that fortress .
we know how strong it is .
la roque will fall tonight .
only a prophet ... or a fool could make such a claim .
in your case , it' s probably the fool .
whichever makes you smile like that .
are you ... married ?
no .
we' ve been fighting the english since before i was born .
there' s no time for marriage .
of course .
are you with ... anyone ?
am i with anyone ?
yeah .
i' m with you .
i know .
i know .
what i mean is , is there someone ... ?
is there someone that you see ?
do i see ?
yeah .
nobody .
it is possible they are hiding on the shore or in the woods .
they could be anywhere .
oh , god .
you know , it' s funny , but we' re speaking the same language , but you don' t understand anything i' m saying , do you ?
get them !
no , no .
it is good .
they are french .
they will help us .
you' re lady claire .
lady ?
i like that .
it' s charming .

arnaut .
he is very grateful you returned his sister ...
you' re english .
no , i' m scottish .
arnaut , he saved the life of one of your men .
you' re scottish , huh ?
yes .
in that case , i do not know how to express my gratitude .
well , you can .
just keep her close and keep her safe .
i can take care of myself .
yes , that' s obvious .
please , do not let her out of your sight , especially tonight .
do not worry , she will be well protected .
i must leave .
i must return to castlegard to search for my friends .
i need to ask you perhaps for a horse and a weapon .
you will not make it alive through the english lines .
they are moving from the village to la roque .
we attack tonight .
you must not go back there .
i must try and find my friends .
i' m sorry .
very well .
i will give you what you ask for .
thank you again .
thank you .
lady claire ...
claire .
i wish we had met at another time .
andre marek .
are you married ?
no .
arnaut ?
arnaut has dismounted , and he' s with his sister .
well done .
in fast , kill arnaut and out .
and may god be with you .
all right .
i have to get inside la roque and find my dad .
you' il never make it through .
i' il find a way .
there is no way .
you' il get killed .
oh , jesus .
go , go .
i don' t have a choice .
yes , you do .
there' s another way .
what , the tunnel ?
yeah .
you never found it .
you don' t know it exists .
there' s always been a rumor .
yeah , but that' s a rumor .
my dad' s life is on the line .
all of our lives are on the line .
look , if that tunnel ever existed , it' s going to exist now , 1357 .
i know it' s in that monastery .
i know it .
i wanna save your father as much as you do .
you have to trust me , i know it' s there .
i know it .
you' ve got to trust me .
stay in line .
move along .
keep the pace !
kill arnaut !
claire !
claire !
claire !
move along !
come on , lads .
that' s marek !
marek !
marek !
i' m ok .
it' s chris and kate , marek .
what about chris and kate ?
they didn' t make it .
they' ve killed them .
what ?
been a while , hasn' t it , frank ?
oh , my god .
i thought you were dead .
right , that' s why you sent taub to assassinate me .
not to assassinate you , to bring you home .
right , just like you are .
no , look ...
listen .
listen to me , will .
i need your help .
what' s this ?
look , it' s not working anyway .
it says here you got less than one and a half hours left .
it doesn' t work .
bullshit .
look , you' ve got to believe me , it wasn' t my fault , ok ?
i' ve got a family .
yeah ?
you' ve met my family .
you got a family ?
you have a family .
i' ve got a family .
so did i !
no !
no !
no !
no !
oh , shit !
oh , my god !
last time i saw him , he was running with his marker for an open space .
i was on the ground , three arrows in me .
i used to be william decker .
itc employee number 273 .
now ... ... i' m sir william de kere .
lord oliver' s aide de camp .
you looked pretty impressive today , marek , for an academic .
how do you know my name ?
i know all of your names .
we read every report out of your dig before we made the first trip back .
how many times have you been here ?
enough to know transcription errors intimately .
transcription errors ?
doniger , that son of a bitch .
he hasn' t told you a thing , has he ?
what are transcription errors ?
mistakes in the dna reconstruction process .
it' s like faxing a fax .
distortions .
mistakes .
only the distortions aren' t in the letters .
it' s body parts .
the organs .
i' ve gone in too many times .
i' il never survive another trip .
all that damage , it can be repaired , but not here .
and not in this time .
you' d have to go back .
why don' t you press the marker ?
we can all go home , decker , huh ?
my name is de kere .
this is my home .
lord oliver awaits his greek fire .
after that , your survival depends on your knowledge of history .
how good you make me look .
i rise in favor , so do you .
i fall , you fall .
i fall , you fall .
marek , where' s your marker ?
de kere , decker , whatever his name is , he took it off me .
oh , god .
we' re friends of edward de johnness .
edward de johnness .
the magister .
he' s my father .
the englishmen have harmed him ?
we don' t know .
we were gonna ask for your help .
yeah , we need your help .
come .
we need to hurry .
we don' t have much time .
lord oliver demands a demonstration before nightfall .
it would be best not to miss the deadline .
they' ve done it .
the stuff' s all there .
this stuff' s a bit coarse , but it' s good .
what am i talking about ?
i can' t do this .
i can' t give them greek fire and influence the course of history .
i may already have done that .
what do you mean ?
when we first arrived here , we were helped by this girl who took us up to castlegard .
in fact , that' s who i went back to get when we escaped .
that girl turned out to be lady claire , arnaut' s sister .
are you serious ?
yeah .
i' ve delivered her to the french for safekeeping .
she' s incredibly important .
her death rallies the french to win .
don' t you understand ?
keep it down , ok ?
now we have to be on oliver' s side just to stay alive .
this is exactly where i was digging .
this is it .
this is the place where ...
we' re here .
we' re ...
what do you mean ?
this is the chamber where i was working .
i' m sorry , what did he say ?
the army of arnaut is ready to attack .
we' re running out of time .
those are the stairs .
it' s under here .
move them up here .
there' s a goodly number of trebuchets , my lord .
what' s a little fire to these stone walls ?
there' s nothing down here .
this is it .
this is the chamber .
this is where the hole was .
we came down here ...
there' s nothing here .
marek would' ve been working there .
the box would' ve been ...
oh , my god .
that is the box .
that' s the parchment he wrote on .
my father' s glasses .
yeah , we' ve got to go .
no , no , put it back .
if we don' t find this , in the future we' re never gonna find your father .
put it back .
we still gotta go .
we gotta get up to la roque .
no , the stone relief was damaged .
somebody had damaged it .
what kind of son of a bitch would damage something so ...
it was me .
it was me .
i was the son of a ...
what is she doing ?
wait !
get back !
stay back !
watch out .
watch out .
oh , wow .
it' s the tunnel .
it' s the tunnel !
give me a torch .
hey , give me that one , kate , watch out .
let me go in .
get arnaut ?
yes , get arnaut .
go .
please , hurry , hurry .
kate , get in here .
oh , whoa .
you got it ?
yeah , i do .
careful , boys , this is greek fire .
you can blow us all to hell here .
smooth and easy , now .
no spills .
that' s good .
trebuchet !
trebuchet !
trebuchet !
trebuchet !
shit .
you ok ?
yeah .
hurry , there' s no time .
trebuchet !
trebuchet !
trebuchet !
bring water !
lord oliver , the magister with your demonstration .
oh , yes , i' il see it now .
understand , my lord , i' ve never ...
show me now !
show him !
your fire of the greeks .
marek , fire it !
ok , come on , let' s move it .
trebuchet !
just fire the damn thing !
i cannot fire it .
fire it !
fire !
ready , fire !
out of the way .
move .
let me pass .
that' s it ?
so you betrayed me .
you promised me greek fire .
i should have had you hung ...
what ?
with your permission , my lord .
the more water , the more fire .
good .
better .
my god , you are a magician , not a magister .
i want this for every cannon .
how many men will you need ?
twenty .
twenty .
give this man 20 men .
as you wish .
this way , magician .
archers to the battlements !
archers to the battlements !
archers to the battlements !
we have 81 % .
no , no .
it' s over .
i' m not gonna play with their lives like this .
we can' t get 100 % efficiency from patched together coils .
what' s the safest minimum percent ?
we' ve done successful tests at 80 % .
you just said we have 81 % .
they were inanimate objects .
with reflectors up .
how much time do we have ?
28 minutes .
no room for error .
they could be deformed .
can we ?
yes , we can .
it' s too risky .
you think i' m gonna let you leave them ?
think i want to ?
i don' t think you care .
they have a chance , some kind of life .
no , you lost the chance for that decision a long time ago .
this is no longer your decision .
you know what ?
it is and i have .
i' m sorry .
fire the moat .
yes , my lord .
fire the moat !
light your arrows .
light arrows .
archers , prepare .
archers , prepare .
stretch .
stretch .
away !
night arrows .
night arrows .
a little surprise for the french .
ready !
stretch .
away !
we' re close now .
we' re close .
i know it .
great .
well done , my lord .
trebuchet !
one more of them , and we become history .
oh , no .
no .
we' re going .
forward , right maybe .
maybe it' s just ...
or we could go up , right ?
we could go up .
kate ...
no , don' t .
no !
no !
kate .
no .
kate .
maybe we missed something .
maybe we made a wrong turn .
we could ...
it' s too late .
it' s just too late .
i said trust me , and i' ve let you down .
and i' ve let your father down .
and ...
i' ve let everybody down .
no .
oh , god .
i' m so sorry .
no , you didn' t .
kate , come here .
kate , come here .
come here .
come here .
close the inner gates !
close the inner gates !
this is growing tiresome .
the courtyard is secure , my lord .
good , but this frenchman needs to be put in his place .
it' s time .
captain !
it is time !
robert .
thirteen minutes left .
let' s try and get them back .
are we gonna go over all this again ?
what are you doing ?
what the hell do you think i' m doing ?
i' m protecting our interests .
what' s happened to you ?
how many lives are lost on the cutting edge of discovery ?
it' s the price for great advances .
these were kids , not astronauts !
i know !
they had no idea !
even worse when they' re deformed !
you know the media .
they' il twist it around and label it a " death machine " .
it has a serious flaw !
and you' il fix it .
no , i won' t .
like you fixed everything else .
no .
what ?
you won' t ?
no , i won' t .
i can' t believe you' d just throw away your place in history .
i already have , we' re cycling up .
think you can go behind my back ?
huh ?
kramer !
kramer ?
make the prisoner ready .
what is your will , my lord ?
back to work .
secure her to the battlements .
i want to be sure the french can see her .
at once , my lord .
i' il give your brother a choice .
oh , shit .
you are to be tied to the battlements .
what ?
either he lays down his arms or he kills you with his own weapons .
let us hope a man who stoops to using his own sister as a spy still has some sense of decency left .
god be with you , lady .
it' s her .
it' s lady claire .
i delivered her to arnaut for safekeeping .
how did the english get her ?
it' s history .
then history will change .
oliver .
release lady claire and bring her down to me now , or by god .
i will destroy your arsenal .
marek !
no !
get the hell out of here .
go now !
halt !
for god' s sake .
if that thing blows , it' il kill us all .
bring her down .
no !
do not touch her !
my lord , if he drops the torch , he then kills her too .
he will not do it .
back off , de kere .
or decker , or whatever your name is .
i will blow your arsenal to hell !
there' s no way out .
you' re english .
