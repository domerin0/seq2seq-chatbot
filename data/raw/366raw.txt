situated on wilshire boulevard' s famous museum row , the la brea tar pits are one of the la basin' s most active geological features .
here for the past 40, 000 years a deep fissure in the earth' s crust has allowed oily tar and methane to bubble up to the surface from far underground .
evidence of the ceaseless activity below our very feet .
the 22 storey beverly heights apartment building will open on schedule in spite of construction delays .
that' s the word from developer norman calder .
many see the new land mark tower as a sign the la economy' s on the rebound .

i' il be home soon .
what can i do for you ?
i' m getting my nose pierced .
it' s a nice look , especially when you sneeze .
you can' t do this !
what ? !
you' re talking about 10, 000 customers with no cooking and no heat .
gas will be restored once it' s safe .
when ?
you' re talking about sending a crew to every house to turn on every damn pilot .
this could take weeks , if not more .
excuse me just one second , please .
having fun yet ?
i' m starting to miss the mississippi .
the mud , floods ?
mike , you have a call on your private line .
that' il be my girl wanting a tattoo .

kelly knows what to do ...

god , you' re a geek .
mike , emmit .
you' re a geek .
nice shirt , stan .
you roark ?
amy barnes .
hi .
i' m from clgs .
nice to meet you .
careful not to disagree with anything dr barnes says .
would you give it a rest ?
all we said was cahuenga was geologically unstable .
the whole city is .
that' s why we don' t want tunnels blown up .
thanks for coming on short notice , but save the fight for later .
sure .
two o' clock good for you ?
huh ?
go ahead .
encourage her .
dr barnes , can you tell me what' s under macarthur park ?
not with any certainty , no ,
that' s a shock . but i ...
we ran trains through all day .
no incidents .
this analysis from the guys who collapsed hollywood boulevard .
my engineers were there no demonstrable risk .
you got conflicting evidence ?
some reason to strand passengers ?
i' m all ears .
until then , we stay on schedule .
i' m sorry , mike .
oh , lah !
he' s gotta change his nicotine patch .
so ?
so .
so ?
how do i find out what' s underneath macarthur park ? .. low grade evacuation ofmacarthurpark .
city officials won' tsayif it has anything to do with the deaths today of those seven public workers .
take a look at this .
ok .
um , what am i looking at ?
that lake was 62 degrees yesterday .
today it' s up to 68 .
yeah , it' s a sunny day .
it is lovely , isn' t it ?
it takes a geological event to heat a million gallons ofwater by six degrees in 12 hours .
what is a geological event ?
i' m sure you' re aware of this , that our continents sit on tectonic plates .
great big rafts on an ocean of molten rock .
yeah .
when they shift , like they did this morning , we get an earthquake .
ok ?
yeah .
same mechanism can sometimes open a fissure , sometimes .
magma can find one of those fissures and rise up through it .
what' s magma ?
lava .
lava ?
uh , here in la ?
it' s one of several possibilities .
it is unlikely , but it is a possibility .
we have a history of that in the downtown area ?
paracutin , 1943 , a mexican farmer sees smoke coming out of his cornfield .
a week later there was a volcano 1, 000ft high .
there' s no history of anything until it happens , then there is .
well , thanks , ladies .
um , enjoy your day in the park .
ooh , yeah , that was subtle .
what ?
you want me to humour him ?
he asked us for a hypothesis .
you have a better one ?
it' s lava .
lava , hm .
hey , hey , that' s me !
my god , i' m gonna call my mom .
uh huh .
i' m on the tv , man !
excuse me .
you invited us , remember ?
you want me to call olber and tell him the demonstrable risk is lava ?
just give me time to do my work .
cos a lake went up a few degrees ? !
no , because seven men baked to death and nobody knows why .
mta does not answer to the city .
i cannot go to the mat with them unless you know something .
i do know something , just not with any certainty .
is that the company line ?
i' m a scientist .
certainty is a big word .
i need time to collect my data .
i' ve gotta get down there and get samples .
i can' t let you do that .
why not ?
it is too dangerous .
that' s why .
i' m sorry .
shit .

oh , it' s too dangerous .
it' s man' s work and you' re girlies .
i can' t let you go down there .
he likes you .

officer , do you know where the driver of that bus is ?
what are you talking about ?

we now have a name for this crisis .
it is , according to the us geological survey , a volcano .

oh , my god .
you would have loved this , rachel .
cover !

hey .
hey , no .
look at it .
keep watching it .

i need 20 strong men standing right here .
go get those firemen right now , and those officers right there .
get over here , guys .
over by this bus .
right now .
let' s go , hurry up .
god , this hieronymus bosch is heavy .
that' s cos he deals with man' s inclination to a thing , in defiance of god' s will .
i didn' t mean it like that .
oh .
fellas , come over here .
right over here .
you were right .
hardly .
gentlemen , i want to move the bus up against the museum like so .
like so ! ?
yes , like so .
then i wanna shoot out the tyres on the other side .

the rest of you guys , along this bus .
come here .
all right , on the countdown , aim low .
three , two , one , fire .
all right , we know that stuff is lava .
what do i do next ?
you have to evacuate the west side .
this' il burn through the city till it hits the ocean .
it has a million people .
there' il be a million dead or homeless .
this is going to destroy everything it touches .
he' s still breathing .
can you grab this arm ?
yeah .
grab him right there .
let' s go , let' s go !
let' s get this guy out .
are you realising what we' re dealing with ?
this is a volcano .
all we can do is get out of its way .
run for the hills and hide ?
right .
i can' t do that .
look out !
look out !
stay with this guy .
stay with him .
hey , get that ladder over here now !

oh ...
i' m sorry .

are you all right ! ?
yeah , i' ve never been better .
so , what do we do now ?
come on .
that lava is coming from a vent .
bad news is there could be other vents , bigger ones , maybe ten times as big , which means we may not have seen the main eruption yet .
you think that' s gonna happen ?
i need specifics , a phone .
your phone !
give me that .
hey !
i need that back .
i' m on the air .
i need that back .

hey , lava' s moving round the bus !

the bus is just deflecting this , ok ?
it is coming back around .
it' s got in the store .
we are dealing with determined stuff here .
all right , we' il build berms until the k rails get here .
with what ?
we' il dig up the streets , we' il improvise .
literally hundreds of firemen , police , city workers have grabbed pickaxes to try to channel this down ... .. the ash and the smoke in the air right now . .. to make a dentin this latest attack on la .
that wall has to be five or six metres tall .
stay with it .
it' s hitting every street .
we' ve got structural fires and inhalation cases .
i can' t keep it out without help .
i' m working on it .
meantime , do all you can to keep it on wilshire .
use fire trucks , if you have to .
my street' s on fire .
you gotta get some trucks down there .
what street ?
the one with smoke coming out .
stanley .
once this is under control .
there won' t be houses left by then !
look , i' m sorry .
we' il get to ' em when we can .

we are in the parking lot at cedars sinai and this is an incredible scene .
these people are staying in the parking lot because the emergencyroom is filled to capacity .
the injuredjustkeep coming here one afteranother .
this , to me , seems more like a mash unit than a majormetropolitan hospital ...
yeah ?
gator , you got my girl ?
right here .
doc says she' s gonna be fine .
nearly done .
all right , let me talk to her .
man' s got a direct line to the governor , but he' s calling you .
i' m fine , daddy .
honestly , ...
i' m ok .
this is gonna sting .
ok ?
i love you , baby .
then stop sending us bodies .
we have gota full house overhere .
i don' t have any choice .
cedars sinai is the only emergency room that' s still safe and north of the flow .
we got earthquake victims , burns , smoke inhalations .
they' re doing triage on the sidewalk .
put the post ops in the mall .
beverly center' s gotta have its own power .
the mall , huh ?
yeah .
anything good at the cineplex ?
have the cops close the streets for you .
oh , goddammit .
jesus h christ .
see that ?
the flow' s gonna turn .
yeah , i saw it .

convalescent homes , hospitals .
i' il tell you .
a big gas station , a million houses and everyone i know .
get back in there .
we need everybody we can get .
shit !
emmit , where are those k rails ?
i need ' em right now .
hey , what were you trying to do ?

wilshire looks bad .
hey , enough !
let' s get these people on the cart .
come on , stan .
come on , stan .

holy mary , mother of god , pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death .
hail mary , full of grace , the lord is with thee .
holy mary , mother of god , pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death .

emmit , faa want an update .
where are we with the airports ?
no more outgoing .
incoming is being re routed to ontario .
no , no , no , no .
marty , no .
look at the screen .
that cloud is blowing due east .
we gotta send everything to san diego .
emmit , they got two gas lines burning on fairfax .
they can' t get any hydrant pressure .
swimming pools .
what about them ?
pump out all the swimming pools .
that' s all the water we need .
emmit , just got a call from la brea .
total gridlock from pico to sunset .
didn' t we send over those traffic cops ?
that' s who' s calling .
cars keep stalling out because of the ash .
it' s clogging up the air filters .
chevettes , right ?
ok , nowyou can see it coming rightat us .
just a relentless tide oflava melting the street itself .
itincinerates everything it touches .
they' re using concrete , they' re using cars , ...
you gotta get me some water pressure !
i can' t .
the city' s out .
hydrants are dry !
lights are out in san francisco .
we gotta get these guys some help .
yeah , i can see that .
don' t you hear me ?
i said the lights are out in san francisco .
but this street' s on fire .
nobody gives a shit about san francisco !
all right , good to see you .
we want a corridor outta these k rails .
keep it flowing down wilshire and headed west , ok ?
where are the rest of them ?
this is it .
there' s only about 80 here .
82 .
everything else is stuck on the 5 or 10 .
we' re trying to keep the city in one piece .
80 rails won' t do it !
what you blaming me for ?
convenience !
maybe we can chopper more in ?
one at at time , forget it !
why not knock down a couple of buildings and block this son of a bitch ?
all right , come with me .
you guys , come with me .
open a reservoir !
and the city drinks what ? !
there won' t be a city , ifyou don' t move .
i' m doing my best !
knock this shit off !
what is with you people ?
chief , how long will it take this stuff to get to fairfax ?
about ten minutes , give or take .
enough time to build a barricade ?
all right , look .
wilshire boulevard , fairfax .
80 k rails , double stacked in a horseshoe .
ok ?
a cul de sac .
that' s gotta be a wall at least 6ft high .
d' you have any helicopters , water tankers ?
not yet , but they' re on the way .
once you get this lava to pool , dump everything on it , all at once , to form a crust .
maybe it' il dam itself like one did in lceland .
thank you .
you' re welcome .
this is putting a band aid on a broken leg .
i don' t know how many men to keep putting in front of this thing .
as many people as it takes .
listen up , let me tell you what' s south of us .
no more museums or department stores , just homes , people .
if we run now , they' re defenceless .
you don' t like my plan , give me another one , but don' t say we' re backing out .
is everybody clear on that ?
yeah !
all right , let' s go .
build a wall .
come on , push him over .
push him over .
all right , come on .
push ' em on in .
give me 14 or 15 guys on each of these things .
right over here on this k rail .
right in here .
hold it .
on the other side .
watch your leg !
right over here , fellas .
there' s room by there .
pick ' em up .
let' s go .
lift !
come on .
we need more guys on this one .
shit , it' s too heavy .
hey , man , you know what they say .
no pain , no gain .
all right , that' s it !
i knew it , i' m about to be the volcano version of rodney king .
give me your hand .
roll the tape .
y' all got this ?
give me your hands .
go home .
i' m supposed to say thanks ?
no .
what did you do that for ?
let' s go .
still don' t have enough guys over here !
give us a hand .
come on .
come on !
you block this , it stays out the neighbourhood ?
yeah , that' s the idea .
come on .
let' s go .
come on , move !
move !
come on !
what you waiting for ?
come on .
all right !
let' s move this thing !
1 , ... 2 , ... 3 !
aagh !
ok , keep moving .
put it over there !
with so manypeople injured , it is so easy to forget the victims who can' t tell you where ithurts .
and , fortunately , these wonderful veterinarians have put their lives on hold to help these animals .
this is a greatstory .
this pot belliedpig was trying to findhis owner ...
ok , just one more stitch .
you' re really brave , you know that ?
we got internal bleeding here .
can you watch her ?
are you ok ?
yeah .
is the boy hers ?
yes .
we' re putting kids in the mall .
prep her .
mommy .
mommy ...
how are you at baby sitting ?
hi .
hi .
you ok ?
step up , we don' t have a lotta time !
roark !
yeah ?
there is lava in the red line .
just came through on the emergency band .
it destroyed a train near macarthur park .
is it still flowing ?
it' s stopped , but i think there' s more .
there' s got to be something feeding this from below .
a source .
it broke through here , at the tar pits , created this vent .
we now know it broke through at macarthur park , so it' s travelling laterally underground over the course of at least eight miles .
you said it blows up .
i' ve never tracked lava under a city before .
i don' t know what it' il do with man made tunnels to travel through .
i need everything to deal with what' s in front of me .
i don' t have time for a theory .
all right , but somebody' s got to .
i can only fight what i can see .
i know .
good luck .
i' m gonna check it out .
all right .
here' s a recap of the crisis as itstands .
throughout the city shelters are being hastily erected out of schools , churches and synagogues in an attempt to house the shaken citizens .
ok , ready , you guys ?
ok , 1 , 2 , 3 .
shh .
rock beats scissor and scissor beats paper .
i' m not paper .
i' m lava .
what beats that ?
my dad ...
i hope .
save your hoses , chief .
i wanna let it pool up all the way to the top .
save your hoses !
not a drop until i give the word .
we' il just have to wait it out now .
this is the moment of truth .
the entire streetis now engulfedin flames .
the weight of this lava has to be intense . .. um das lava zuruckdrangen .
will this plan work ?
hubschrauber !
all right , that' s it , chief .
open ' em up !
open hoses .
open hoses !
there must be thousands of gallons of water being dropped over this entire area .
the entire area is drenched and the steam coming off this thing is unbelievable .
oh , shit .
oh , god .
i don' t believe it .
it looks possible that this whole thing maybe nearing an end .
this incredible gamble seems to be paying off .
did we just beat this bastard ?
it looks like it !
flood control !
ladies and gentlemen , it is a miracle .
and look at the faces of these people .
look at these guys !
it looks like they' ve done it .
they have accomplished the impossible .
they' ve beaten mothernature and claimed an extraordinary victory over the volcano .
one lastheroic stand here on the corner offairfaxand wilshire .
hell of a party !
i probably should have brought a hat .
chief , they need some help over on stanley .
structural fires , residential .
miller , get your engine over to stanley .
yes , sir .
i guess that' s my bus .
hey , good luck .
you , too , man .
show me what this baby can do .
you ready or what ?
yo , i always wanted to ride one of these things , man .
stanley ave , here we come !
whoo !
you' re a good man , jerry .
all right , roark .
thanks , fellas .
way to go , guys !
roark !
hey , way to go .
how fast can you get to wilshire and western ?
we got a problem .
not any more , we got it stopped .
volume of ash is too hot to be out of danger .
how come it' s stopped ?
maybe it went some place else .
how d' you know it didn' tjust stop ?
i don' t , but when mount st helen' s blew the force was 27, 000 times greater than that of the hiroshima bomb .
you think that vent released that much energy ?
no .
let' s assume we haven' tseen the realbulk of the magma yet .
trust me , get down here .
shit !
hey , hey , that' s my bike .
as crews battled the flow on wilshire , emergency rooms at cedars sinai and midwayhospitals have all reported that their staffs andsupplies are being overwhelmed ...
yes ?
jaye , i wantyou home with me where it' s safe .
norman , can we talk later ?
i don' t like his breathing .
let' s tube him .
jaye , you' ve been there hours .
let someone else take over !
god knows what those " people " are coughing up on you .
calder , we need help .
i' m hanging up .
jaye !
go !
right over the red line .
that steam could come from anywhere .
maybe the quake broke a water main .
how' d it get heated ?
i don' t know .
lower me down .
i' m gonna find out .
no .
why ?
too dangerous ?
yes .
i thought it was a water main .
all right .
i' il go .
how you gonna get up ?
i' m gonna lift you ?
i' m not letting you go .
then what are we gonna do ?
oh , god , this is so stupid .
this city' s finally paying for its arrogance .
which particular arrogance is that ?
building a subway under land that' s seismically active .
it was a foolish man that builthis house upon the sand .
matthew 7 : 26 .
a favourite among geologists .
all right , there' s the tunnel .
i don' t see anything .
hm .
what way are we facing ?
i don' t know .
i can' t see anything .
hey !
wha ...
oh !
damn .
ow !
damn !
oh , god .
the tunnel' s insulating it .
it' s like a lava tube .
it' s keeping it fluid , which is why it' s moving so fast .
but moving where ?
it' s gonna go through the tunnels until it hits a block .
once there , it' il punch through .
you mean erupt .
yeah !
one , two , three .
one , two , three .
how far between tunnel sections ?
how should i know ?
guess !
10 or 12 feet .
this is roark .
i need to know where the red line stops .
we gotta figure out how fast this shit is moving .
you mean where the last station is ?
no , where did you stop the tunnel ?
we stopped drilling under the beverly center , la cienega .
my god .
that' s where cedars sinai is .
that' s where kelly is .
how long before it hits la cienega ?
hold on .
how long before it hits la cienega ? !
i don' t know .
if a tunnel' s caved in , it' il be slower .
god .
30 minutes , maybe less .
that' s not enough time !
no kidding .
we gotta move those people .
no , no , that ain' t a possibility , mike .
we don' t have any hands left .
we got secondary fires popping off all over the city .
they' re looting in beverly hills .
then we have to re route it or block it in some way .
we got 2, 000 people in the way .
listen , moses couldn' t re route this shit , ok ?
it' s everywhere .
we got a flow in a storm drain ...
the genesee transformer' s out .
that means the west ...
where' s that storm drain go ?
it dumps into ballona creek .
what did you just say ?
hold it !
it dumps into ballona creek .
ballona creek runs into the ocean .
we caught a break on that one .
yeah .
i would say !
how close is it to cedars ?
it' s close enough .
all right , listen up , emmit .
i need a demolitions team ,
lapd , national guard , private contractor , or all three at san vicente and 3rd right now !
we want ' em with all they' ve got .
oh , shit .
man , i wanna be like mike .
right outside cedars we don' tknow what' s going on rightnow .
officials have toldpeople here to evacuate immediately .
and realise , these are injuredpeople , some severely , so something is going on .
all right , here' s what the lava is doing .
it will flow down the red line subway tunnel until it comes to a dead end : this intersection .
this is the holly hills storm drain extension .
it connects here to the holly hills trench .
anything that flows into that trench will come through the storm drain , on to the ocean .
we got 25 minutes ...
20 minutes .
20 minutes to extend the san vicente trench 200 yards up san vicente boulevard to this place here .
extend it ?
yes , extend it .
where are we at ?
ground zero .
lava' il break through here .
right here ?
yes .
i want you to drill holes in san vicente boulevard ,
iower enough charges into it to blow up a trench 200 yards long , as wide as the street
and as deep as you can make .
what !
we' re gonna take this thing to the ocean .
wait , this won' t work .
the street slopes the other way .
look at the contours .
it is not going to move into the trench .
it will go the opposite direction into the patients .
maybe some can be diverted ...
no !
it won' t .
would you trust me ?
it is going to flow that way .
now , everybody grab some stretchers .
let' s save as many lives as we possibly can .
that' s 2, 000 patients .
we can' t possibly save everybody .
i know .
i sent them over there with my daughter .
i ..

i ...
i don' t know ...
i don' t know what to do .
what about a dam ?
something we can drop in front of the hospital and divert the flow this way ?
