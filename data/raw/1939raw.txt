the feeling begins .
very tender , very loving .
then the pain starts .
claws slip underneath the skin and tear their way up ... ... just before they reach my eyes , they dig in .
and i remember .
first i fasted for three months .
i even whipped myself before i went to sleep .
at first it worked .
then the pain came back .
and the voices .
they call me by name .
jesus .
who is it ?
who are you ?
why are you following me ?
are you ready ?
no more crosses .
we' re ready .
where is your mind ?
do you hear what i' m saying ?
the messiah won' t come that way .
what do you mean by that ?
who told you ?
you' re a disgrace !
romans can' t find anyone to make crosses , except for you !
you do it !
you' re worse than them !
you' re a jew killing jews .
you' re a coward !
how will you ever pay for your sins ?
with my life , judas .
i don' t have anything else .
don' t turn away .
look at me .
with your life .
what do you mean ?
please , judas .
i don' t know .
are you still taking the cross ?
yes , i am .
no , you' re not .
i won' t let you !
i won' t let you .
please , i beg you , don' t get in the way .
what way ?
what' s happened to you ?
i' m struggling .
with who ?
i don' t know .
i' m struggling .
i struggle .
you collaborate .
traitor !
you are the people of israel .
your children are watching .
you are the people of god .
he is judging us .
he is watching you .
there he is .
kill him !
don' t touch him .
get away from him !
don' t you defend him .
he' s my son .
god is with us .
he' s judging us .
fight !
god help us !
god give us strength !
come .
come with me .
this man , naked before you now , is condemned for sedition ... " ... for lifting his hand against rome .
sedltio
he rallied the people to revolution .
he promised that a messiah would come from among the people ...
... to rise up and destroy rome .
rome is nothing .
murder ...
... betrayal ...
... looting and so on , and so therefore , he is condemned to die .
rome condemns him .
and all the gods of rome condemn him .
god is our shield .
he is our shield .
he is our heart .
he is our heart .
he is our shield .
he is our shield .
he will not abandon you .
he will not abandon you .
god !
god loves me , i know he loves me .
i want him to stop .
i can' t take the pain .
the voices and the pain .
i want him to hate me .
i fight him .
i make crosses so he' il hate me .
i want him to find somebody else .
i want to crucify every one of his messiahs .
you' re sure it' s god ?
you' re sure it' s not the devil ?
i' m not sure .
i' m not sure of anything .
if it' s the devil , the devil can be cast out .
but what if it' s god ?
you can' t cast out god , can you ?
who' s that ?
who' s following me ?
is that you ?
magdalene .
magdalene .
thank you , lord ... ... for bringing me where i did not want to go .
he must be one of gods angels .
he came down to show me the way .
who' s out there ?
who is it ?
what are you doing here ?
i want you to forgive me .
i' ve done too many bad things .
i' m going to the desert , and i need you to forgive me ... ... before i go , please .
i see .
you sit out there all day with the others ... ... and then come in here with your head down , saying , " forgive me .
forgive me .
it' s not that easy .
just because you need forgiveness , don' t ask me to do it .
i' m sorry get out !
go away !
look , mary ... ... look at this .
god can change this .
god can save your soul .
he already broke my heart , he took you away from me .
and i hate both of you .
hate me , blame me .
it' s all my fault , but not god' s .
don' t say that about god .
who made me feel this way about god ?
i know , that' s why i' m here .
it' s why i want you to forgive me .
i' il pay my debt .
i know ... ... there are some things i' ve done , and to you .
pay or go away .
don' t you remember ?
no , i don' t remember .
why should i ?
nothing' s changed .
say the truth .
if you want to save my soul ... ... this is where you' il find it .
you know that .
you' re the same as all the others , only you can' t admit it .
you' re pitiful .
i hate you .
here' s my body .
save it .
save it .
is that the way you show you' re a man ?
turn away , don' t look at me .
you never had the courage to be a man .
don' t look at me !
if you weren' t hanging on to your mother , you were hanging on to me .
now you' re hanging on to god ... ... going to the desert to hide because you' re scared .
go .
whenever i see you , my heart breaks .
i do remember when we were children .
never have i felt so much tenderness toward anyone ... ... as i felt toward you then .
all i ever wanted was you .
nothing else .
what do you think i wanted ?
please .
stay .
is it so bad sharing a prostitute' s room ?
i won' t touch you .
you' il still be a virgin for the desert .
mary , i' m sorry .
i can' t stay .
welcome .
this way .
do you always pray this late at night ?
it' s a funeral .
the master of the monastery died .
shall i pray with you ?
sleep .
you must be tired .
i know who you are .
that was the man who brought me here last night .
last night ?
he was dead last night .
the master' s soul has gone to heaven .
his body' s work is completed .
it walked under the sun and the moon ... ... over sand and stone ... ... sinned , felt pain ... ... yearned for heaven .
we commend his remains to our god .
flesh ... ... the master no longer needs you .
melt away .
first came the wings , then the angel .
his spirit actually appeared to you .
he treated you like a royal visitor .
he recognized you for something .
he couldn' t have recognized me for anything .
i only came here to serve god .
that' s all .
that' s all god wants from me .
i' m sure of it .
think of how you' re blessed .
god actually makes himself known to you .
i don' t know what god wants from me .
all my life i' ve wanted to hear god' s voice .
i' ve dedicated my life to him .
sometimes ... ... i think i feel him , but i' m never really sure .
but you always know .
god took you by the hand and brought you here .
you think it' s a blessing to know what god wants ?
i' il tell you what he wants .
he wants to push me over !
can' t he see what' s inside of me ?
all my sins .
we all sin .
not my sins .
i' m a liar .
a hypocrite .
i' m afraid of everything .
i don' t tell the truth .
i don' t have the courage .
when i see a woman , i blush and look away .
i want her , but i don' t take her , for god , and that makes me proud .
then my pride ruins magdalene .
i don' t steal , i don' t fight ... ... i don' t kill .
not because i don' t want to , but because i' m afraid .
i want to rebel against you , against everything ... ... against god , but ... ... i' m afraid .
you want to know who my mother and father are ?
you want to know who my god is ?
fear .
you look inside me and that' s all you' il find .
but the more devils we have inside of us , the more of a chance we have to repent .
lucifer is inside me .
he says to me , " you' re not the son of king david .
you' re not a man , you' re the son of man .
and more , the son of god .
and more than that , god .
do you want to ask me anything else ?
everything is from god .
everything has two meanings .
jesus , my sweet jesus .
i forgive you .
leave me !
they' ve gone .
you have to leave , too .
no , i have to stay .
no .
you' ve been purified .
god has just blessed you .
the snakes came from inside you .
now you have to leave , too .
you have to go back ... ... and speak to people and share your heart .
speak to who ?
to anyone who will listen .
and say what ?
just open your mouth .
do you love mankind ?
i see men and i feel sorry for them , that' s all .
that' s enough .
i' ve got orders to kill you .
go ahead .
tonight i was purified .
i can' t fight with god anymore .
here' s my neck .
cut it , i' m ready .
what are you ?
what kind of a man are you ?
what you want , i want .
that' s why he brought us together , it' s god' s plan .
i come to kill you and you help me , that' s god' s plan ?
these voices you hear , it' s god' s voice ?
only you understand it ?
you' d better make me understand it , too .
i' il tell you as much as i know .
the fainting spells , the voices , the visions .
power .
magic .
is there some secret ?
tell me your secret .
pity .
pity for who ?
yourself ? .
pity for men .
our enemies are men .
i feel pity for everything .
donkeys ...
... grass , sparrows .
and ants ?
you feel pity for them , too ?
yes .
everything' s a part of god .
when i see an ant , when i look at his shiny black eye ... ... you know what i see ?
i see the face of god .
you' re not afraid of dying ?
why should i be ?
death isn' t a door that closes , it opens .
it opens and you go through it .
if i don' t kill you , what happens ?
i' il speak to people .
what are you going to say ?
i' il just open my mouth and god will do the talking .
maybe god didn' t send you here to kill me .
maybe he sent you here to follow me .
just so there' s no mistake .
i' il go with you until i understand .
but if you stray this much ... ... from the path , i' il kill you .
it' s magdalene .
she deserves it .
get out of there .
get out of the way !
this is not your business .
do you want to get hurt ?
did you hear what he said , idiot ?
move !
no .
i don' t want this .
listen to him .
he doesn' t want this .
well , we want it .
why ?
we don' t have to tell you why !
i' ve had enough .
we live in a whorehouse .
she' s a jew .
she works on the sabbath .
she goes with romans on the sabbath .
she broke moses ' law .
she dies .
who has never sinned ?
who ?
which one of you people has never sinned ?
whoever that is , come up here !
and throw these !
i have nothing to hide .
good .
take this .
it' s bigger .
be careful , zebedee .
there is a god .
he' s seen you cheat your workers .
he' s seen you with that widow , what' s her name ?
judith .
judith .
aren' t you afraid god will paralyze you if you lift that stone ?
that your arm will wither ?
that you' il lose all strength ?
god has so many miracles .
what ifl say the wrong thing ?
what ifl say the right thing ?
come closer .
come closer !
we' re all a family .
come closer , so you can hear .
i have something to tell you .
who is he ?
it' s jesus from nazareth .
nothing good can come out of nazareth , even the scriptures say so .
i' m sorry , but ... ... the easiest way to make myself clear ... ... is to tell you a story .
a farmer was planting in his field .
some seed fell on the ground and the birds ate it .
some seed fell on rocks and dried up .
but some seed ....
some seed fell on rich soil ... ... and grew into enough wheat to feed a whole nation .
can you hear me ?
we can hear you fine .
i' m the farmer .
the farmer is me .
and 2 and 2 makes 4 .
another lunatic !
rabbi ... ... tell me , if you' re the farmer ... ... and we' re the stones , what' s the seed ?
what' s the seed ?
love .
love one another .
that' s easy to say , maybe that' s good advice , but for some other world .
these people are starving .
first you feed them , then you talk !
i used to think god was angry , too , but not anymore !
he used to jump on me like a wild bird and dig his claws into my head .
but then one morning , he came to me .
he blew over me like a cool breeze and said , " stand up .
and here i am .
and you will go to hell .
these are children' s stories .
how can they help us ?
what are you hungry for ?
what are you thirsty for ?
for justice !
and bread !
bread , too .
you' re thirsty for justice , for people to treat you fairly ... ... for people to treat you with respect .
what i' m telling you is ... ... whoever' s hungry for justice , they are the ones who' il be blessed .
they' il be filled with bread .
they' il never be hungry again .
they' il have the real value , the value of love .
to love , share and comfort .
they' il have the courage to do the good .
and you .
you' re mourning .
mourners will be blessed .
you' il have god to comfort you .
you won' t need men to do it .
and the meek .
they' re the ones who' il be blessed .
and the suffering , they' il be blessed , too .
and the peacemakers and the merciful ... ... and the sick , and the poor , and the outcasts ... ... you' il all be blessed because heaven is yours !
and believe me ...
... believe me , those who are laughing now ... ... will be crying later .
those whose stomachs are filled now will be hungry later .
and the rich will be poor forever !
kill them !
i didn' t say death !
i said love !
i said love !
enough .
come .
no , father , i' m staying .
we have to work .
i need you !
come .
i' m sorry , father , i' m staying , too .
not the two of you .
come on !
let me come with you , i can help .
stay here .
you' il know when .
tell people about me .
james .
andrew .
move over , john .
move over , james .
i was just comfortable .
peter wants to lay down .
peter , there' s no more room .
i' m cold .
i want to be by the fire .
go over by philip .
we' re all cold .
shut up .
rabbi , can i talk to you ?
i' m not like these other men .
i mean , they' re good enough , they' re good men .
but they' re weak .
one' s worse than the other .
where' d you find them ?
look at me .
if i love somebody , i would die for them .
if i hate somebody , i' d kill them .
i could even kill somebody i loved if they did the wrong thing .
did you hear me ?
do you understand what i said ?
yes , i understand .
the other day you said , if a man hit you , you' d turn the other cheek .
i didn' t like that .
only an angel could do that , or a dog .
i' m sorry but i' m neither .
i' m a free man .
i don' t turn my cheek to anyone .
we both want the same thing .
we do ?
do you want freedom for israel ?
no .
i want freedom for the soul .
no .
that' s what i can' t accept .
that' s not the same thing !
first you free the body , then the spirit !
the romans come first .
you don' t build a house from the roof down but from the foundation up .
the foundation is the soul .
the foundation is the body .
that' s where you must begin .
if you don' t change the spirit first , change what' s inside ... ... then you' il only replace the romans with someone else , and nothing changes .
even if you' re victorious , you' il still be filled with the poison .
you' ve got to break the chain of evil .
how do you change then ?
with love .
who' s there ?
it' s me , andrew .
is everything ....
it' s all right .
go back to sleep .
judas and i are talking .
there' s an example .
you know , the zealots ordered me to kill you .
why did you change your mind ?
i decided to wait .
for what ?
i thought maybe you were the one .
to unite us .
i didn' t want to destroy that .
how do we know ?
how could i be the messiah ?
when those people were torturing magdalene , i wanted to kill them .
and then i opened my mouth ... ... and out comes the word " love .
why ?
i don' t understand .
i can' t look to the others for answers , all they do is follow you .
we' il go to judea and see john the baptist .
every day he tells hundreds of people the messiah is coming .
he' il know .
he' il know .
i' m afraid .
stay with me .
behold !
i will raise up evil against you out of your own house ... ... and i will take your wives , before your eyes ... ... and give them to your neighbor , and he shall lie with your wives ... ... in the sight of this sun .
you may listen and listen again ... ... but you will never understand .
you may look , but you will never know .
these people' s wits are dulled .
their ears are deafened and their eyes blinded ... ... so they cannot see with their eyes , nor hear with their ears ... ... so that they may turn and be healed .
on this day ...
he sounds like the messiah .
no . " ... i will crush the horns of the new moon and i will spill darkness over the world .
i will reverse your laughter , turn it into tears ....
go in front .
let him see you .
listen , it is the thunder of many peoples ....
even from behind , i knew i had seen him before .
where ?
was it a dream ?
yes , it was .
but in the dream , he was dressed in white .
you will have the smell of decay ...
... and branding , instead of beauty .
your men shall fall by the sword ...
... and your women shall sit on the ground , stripped bare .
who are you ?
do you recognize me ?
who are you ?
do you know the prophets ?
what does isaiah say ?
he says , " prepare the way of the lord .
are you telling me that' s you ?
i don' t know .
tell me .
why are you here ?
to be baptized .
no , i don' t dare .
if you' re the master , then you have to baptize me .
baptize me .
love .
what does it mean ?
love is sweet as honey .
but it' s also blood .
love is action .
you want a new crop , you burn the earth .
but isn' t love enough ?
no !
look at the world .
look around you .
plague , war , corruption ... ... false prophets , false idols , worship of gold .
nothing is of value .
the tree is rotten .
you have to take the axe and cut it down .
if i was a woodcutter , i' d cut .
if i was a fire , i' d burn .
but i' m a heart and i love and that' s all i can do .
i' m a heart , also .
but i can' t love what' s unjust .
what i can' t love , i attack .
god demands it .
anger ?
yes , god demands anger .
anger ?
but we' re all brothers .
you think love is god' s only way ?
go to the dead sea , look in the bottom .
you' il see two whores , sodom and gomorrah .
that' s god' s way .
on the day of the lord ... ... blood will flow from wood .
the stones of the houses will come alive and kill their owners .
that day is here .
he gave me the axe .
now i give it to you .
that' s not the answer .
then what is the answer ?
i don' t know .
well , if you won' t listen to me , who will you listen to ?
god .
the god of israel is the god of the desert .
if you want to speak to him , then you' il have to go to the desert .
i' il go to idumaea .
thank you , baptist .
be careful .
god isn' t alone out there .
i feel sorry for you .
you were lonely .
you cried .
so i came .
i didn' t call for you .
who are you ?
your spirit .
my spirit ?
you' re afraid of being alone .
you' re just like adam .
he called me and i took one of his ribs ... ... and made it into a woman .
you' re here to trick me .
trick you ?
to love and care for a woman , to have a family , is this a trick ?
why are you trying to save the world ?
aren' t your own sins enough for you ?
what arrogance to think you can save the world .
the world doesn' t have to be saved .
save yourself .
find love .
i have love .
look ... ... in my eyes .
look at my breasts .
do you recognize them ?
just nod your head ... ... and well be in my bed together .
jesus .
after ten days ... ... the hunger went away .
welcome , jesus .
congratulations .
you' re past the small temptations of a woman and a family .
were both bigger than that .
who are you ?
you don' t recognize me ?
i' m you , i' m your heart .
your heart is so greedy .
it pretends to be humble ... ... but it really wants to conquer the world .
i never wanted a kingdom on earth .
the kingdom of heaven is enough .
you' re a liar .
when you were making crosses for the romans ... ... your head was exploding with dreams of power .
power over everyone .
you said it was god , but you really wanted power .
now you can have what you want .
any country you want .
all of them .
you could even have rome .
liar .
step into my circle so i can pull your tongue out .
archangel , move back .
move back , you' re blinding me .
jesus .
i' m the one you' ve been waiting for .
make me a god , god .
god .
god , make me a god .
but i was just a child then .
you are god .
the baptist knew it .
now it' s time you admit it .
you are his son .
the only son of god .
join me .
together well rule the living and the dead .
you' il give life and you' il take life .
you' il sit in judgement , and i' il sit next to you .
imagine how strong wed be together .
satan ?
well see each other again .
don' t be afraid .
you are the one .
my work is done .
now i can die .
the lord wants me to tell you to stand up .
his day is here .
take this axe .
take this message to everyone .
please .
what do you want ?
i' m a foreigner .
from galilee .
i' m tired .
you don' t know how good this tastes .
some more wine , please .
mary ... ... martha ... ... i want to say that you' re both blessed .
i came here , you didn' t know me .
you took me in , fed me , restored me ... ... and god came down and went into my heart .
go on .
no .
i' ve talked too much already .
silence is better .
no , it' s not .
do you have a wife ?
no .
how can you live like that in the desert ?
tell me the truth .
don' t you miss all this ?
having a home , a real life .
i admit it .
i' d like it , but i' il never have it .
listen , if you really want god , don' t spend your time in the desert .
he' s not there , he' s right here .
read your scriptures .
god does not want you to fast and pray .
he wants you to make children .
mary , you' re making him uncomfortable .
he' s a guest .
he knows what i' m talking about .
come and help me .
it' s not right to tease these men .
i wasn' t teasing .
remember the baptist ?
it' s nothing to tease about .
the baptist ?
what ?
he' s dead .
he was killed by herod .
you didn' t know ?
they say the king was drunk and cut off the baptist' s head to satisfy him .
now they say they' re going to kill everyone who was baptized .
no one forced you to be baptized .
you were baptized , too .
you begged for it .
so be quiet .
i can just imagine in galilee right now .
the sea .
they say the fishing' s so good you just touch the nets and the fish jump in .
don' t talk about fish .
it reminds me of my sheep .
i don' t know what' s happened to them .
maybe we should wait for him in galilee .
no , we promised the master we would wait here .
that was over a month ago .
thousands of people are waiting to see and to hear him and he' s gone .
the whole movement .
we look like fools .
nathaniel' s right .
he makes sense .
let' s return to galilee .
if we go back to galilee , like peter says
brothers !
i don' t understand you .
think of the last words the baptist said .
he said , " jesus of nazareth , leave the desert .
i am finished .
you return to mankind .
how do we know he really said that ?
everybody says he did .
but how do we know ?
even if he didn' t , the words are important .
why ?
because people believe them .
and what if our master' s ....
what if he' s the one ?
what " one " ?
the one .
what do you mean ?
the messiah ?
we don' t know the baptist said that .
nobody knows .
he' s not like elijah .
he' s saying that the world of god is here now .
he just meant , " continue my work .
continue to do the work i' ve been doing .
right here elijah ascended to heaven .
doesn' t that mean something to you ?
we' re waiting here .
we' re waiting here .
i don' t think we should go back to galilee .
i think we should wait here .
that' s what i love about you , peter .
you' re as steady and as solid as a rock .
nobody can change your mind .
what good are you ?
master .
rabbi .
john heard your footsteps in his heart ... ... in a way , and we were preparing to welcome you .
were you baptized ?
yes .
john baptized with water and they killed him .
now i baptize with fire .
ls that what the baptist told you ?
i have an invitation for you .
ls there a celebration ?
no .
i' m not inviting you to a celebration .
i' m inviting you to a war .
this is my heart .
take it .
god is inside of us .
the devil is outside us , in the world all around us .
we' il pick up an axe and cut the devil' s throat .
we' il fight him wherever he is .
in the sick ... ... in the rich ... ... even in the temple .
i' il lead you .
if you have sheep ... ... give them away .
if you have a family ... ... leave them .
i believed in love .
now i believe in this !
who' s with me ?
adonai .
today and tomorrow i cast out devils and work cures .
on the third day ... ... i shall be perfected .
out !
satan , leave !
satan , out !
leave him !
moses , elijah , isaiah ... ... touch my mouth ... ... touch my lips .
go to the temple .
let the high priests see you .
look !
he was blind and jesus healed him .
look .
he was blind and jesus healed him .
look .
you don' t belong at a wedding .
we' re here to celebrate purity .
i' m sorry , but these people are my guests .
let me explain something to you .
what do you think heaven' s like ?
it' s like a wedding .
god' s the bridegroom and man' s spirit' s the bride .
the wedding takes place in heaven ... ... and everyone' s invited .
god' s world is big enough for everyone .
nazarene , that' s against the law .
then the law' s against my heart .
don' t touch me .
you are now sacred to me ... ... through this ring .
you are now sacred to me , through this ring .
according to the law of moses and israel .
according to the law of moses and israel .
my cousins are very upset .
they only brought enough wine for 3 days .
now another day' s gone past and it' s gone .
what' s in those ?
water .
no .
it' s wine .
no , it' s water .
i put it there myself .
it' s wine .
it' s water .
go over there and make sure .
do it .
you' re right .
it is wine .
brothers !
my old friends !
listen to me .
it' s me the prophets preached about .
god talked to me in the desert .
he gave me a secret and told me to bring it to you .
didn' t you hear me coming ?
i ran here to nazareth , where i grew up , to bring you the news .
the world of god is here now .
you work miracles .
make a miracle for us .
make us believe in you .
otherwise go away .
the messiah doesn' t need miracles .
he is the miracle .
now he' s here .
are you ready for me ?
i' m here to tear down everything around you .
you know what i' il replace it with ?
something new .
god .
the world of god .
so take your bread and give it to the poor .
what difference does it make what you own ?
you have gold and silver .
it' s going to rot .
that rot is going to eat away your hearts .
all of you !
there will be a flood and a fire .
everything will be destroyed .
but there will be a new ark riding on that fire !
and i hold the keys and i open the door .
and i decide who goes in and who doesn' t .
you' re my brothers from nazareth and you' re the first i invite on the ark .
don' t wait .
don' t waste your life .
come with me .
you' re the son of mary , right ?
who are you to tell us about god ?
he made better crosses than speeches .
go get someone from his family to take him away .
he' s insane .
what are you laughing at ?
everything you have will burn .
soon !
get out now !
come with me to jerusalem !
see ?
this is what happens when a man doesn' t get married .
the semen backs up into his brain .
go home !
you' re a demon .
you' re possessed .
you' re a lunatic !
this is my home !
you should be ashamed .
kill him !
he' s going to burn us .
don' t touch him !
if i could touch every stone ... ... if i could breathe on every branch , they' d get up and follow me !
so what' s wrong with you ?
come with me to jerusalem !
jerusalem is falling !
i feel it .
i know it .
you see these people ?
they' re poor .
they' re blind .
they' re crippled .
they' re going to be our army .
we' re going to need better men than this .
god will give them to me .
we' re going to build a new jerusalem .
son .
come back with me .
please .
who are you ?
your mother .
i don' t have a mother .
i don' t have any family .
i have a father , in heaven .
don' t say that to me .
who are you ?
i mean , really .
who are you ?
why are you crying ?
didn' t you see them ?
what ?
when he spoke to you , there were thousands of blue wings behind him .
i swear to you , mary , there were armies of angels .
there were ?
thousands .
i' d be happier if there weren' t .
when was he buried ?
three days ago .
roll away the stone .
lazarus .
lazarus .
in the name of the prophets ... ... in the name of jeremiah and my father ... ... in the name of the most holy god ... ... i call you here .
i call you here !
