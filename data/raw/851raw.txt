i thought you weren' t interested in max .

this is tie dye .
and i' m not interested in max .
i' m interested in that buyer that he' s bringing up from new york .
oh , there it is .
thanks , phoebe .
why don' t you just have them here ?
homes are for free expression , not for good impressions .
incoming !
if you catch my drift .
are you sure you wanna wear the uniform , admiral ?
not that you don' t look great .
it just looks so military . she might as well know what she' s getting .
okay , but hold off on that eight kid thing .
why ?
because that' s a minimum third date , second bottle of wine announcement .
hey , you know , believe it or not , i have been on a few dates before ... a couple of decades ago .
admiral ?
yeah .
ethan , do you know that you can call me dad ?
oh .
admiral , is this lady gonna be our new mom ?
i don' t think so .
it' s just a blind date . she can' t see ?
can she navigate using sonar , like a bat ?
hey , why don' t you guys go swimming in the bathtub ?
aye , aye , sir .
go ahead .
i get the boat .
uh uh , you get the duck .
you get the duck .
no .
let' s just give her a little hint of what' s underneath .
you know , christina , sometimes i wonder where you came from .
mom' s side .
don' t wait up .
i won' t .
and so otter , he says , " ls she blind ?
and ely wants to know if you' re a bat .
because ....
would you like red or white ?
red .
red it is .
darrell would drink beer with everything .
i mean , if he could have a keg with dinner , he would .
would you like to order ?
waiter ? sure .
i' il be right back . sure .
see ?
now that is the kind of thing that would drive darrell crazy .
you' re here now , " he' d say , " so take our order !
you talk about darrell a lot .
well , yeah .
we were married for seven years .
he didn' t tell you that ?
must have slipped his mind .
yeah , well , that' s just like him .
i' m gonna go hit the head .

were you distracted by his good conduct medal ? shut up , max .
helen white .
16, 137 results .
this lnternet is so darn easy .
oh , god .
he' s married .
so how' d it go with claudia ? she' s quite a catch , huh ?
yeah .
it' s amazing you ever let her go . she mentioned she' s my ex wife , did she ?
yeah , it came up .
what , did you ask for references ?
you know , just ' cause she hates me is no reason you two couldn' t work out .
you know who i ran into at the restaurant ?
uh uh .
helen white .
ring a bell ?
ding ding ?
helen white ?
wait a minute .
the helen white ?
the one you were gonna marry ?
well , it' s either fate or trouble . she looked great , but i think she' s married . she was with some guy , and she had a ring .
okay , that' s trouble .
come on , frank , what are you thinking ?
i don' t know .
i was up all night .
i was googling her .
jeez , frank , you googled another man' s wife ?
yeah .
what do you think that means ?
i don' t know . something dirty .
well , it' s not .
i just wish there was a place i could run into her again .
remember the senior class picnic down by the river ?
the thunderstorm ?
yeah .
everybody screaming .
then we crawled under the rowboat .
oh , yeah .
and then , even when it stopped raining , we didn' t come out .
yeah .
anyway , that max ... he' s a lucky guy .
max ?
you think i' m with max ?
no .
but you' re wearing a wedding ring .
yeah , no , i am .
i just never took it off .
my husband passed away about four years ago .
car accident .
oh , i' m sorry .
i understand .
i ....
i lost my wife a few years ago .
oh , frank , i' m sorry .
flashback !
frank and helen holding hands .
so cute .
you wanna dance ?
so , how many kids do you have ?
how many kids do you have ?
you first .
okay , look , you' re gonna find out eventually ... because there' s too many to hide in the closet .
i have eight kids .
i have 1 0 .
you have 10 ?
i have 10 .
you don' t .
i do .
i have 10 .
did you say 10 ?
yeah .
i had four and we adopted six .
i mean , that wasn' t the plan .
we were foster parents , and we just fell in love with all of them ... so we adopted .
probably seems crazy .
you don' t have to explain to me .
i mean , i never thought that i' d love being a dad this much .
my wife , she was the one who wanted the big family .
but now it just seems like the most natural thing in the world .
is this really happening ?
i hope so .
so then i asked her to marry me .
and i said yes .
what ?
it was spontaneous and so romantic .
how could you do this ?
we don' t even know this guy !
you got married ?
without telling us ?
yeah .
yeah . sir , at least when you were reassigned to guam , there was an e mail .
does he know you have 10 kids ?
who wants the talking stick first ?
may i have it , please ?
yes , jimi .
are you crazy ?
yeah , mom .
we don' t even know him , mom !
okay .
quiet .
i have the talking stick .
he' s a lovely , lovely man .
and i' m sorry that we didn' t include you .
and he has ....

before you make your break for the bedroom ... could you point me to my billet ?
behind the kitchen , mrs. munion .
how do you like the place ?
it has a certain ...
charm . ... smell .
like paprika with a hint of wet dog .
we' re really glad you like the place .
okay .
okay .
crew !
kids !
all right , then .
all right , kids .
fall in for billeting !
for what ?
room assignments .
all eyes on the chart .
your rooms are numbered .
your bathroom schedules are color coded .
you' ve gotta be kidding .
yeah , right .

jump start ?
yeah .
look , grab about a quart of sun block .
i have a plan .
okay .
so , everyone , what do you think of the my way ?
who' s gonna sail this thing ?
we , the beardsley family , sail it ... while you guys , i' m guessing , hang out in the cabin and pick your noses .
no , we are all going to sail it ... working together like the many tentacles of an octopus ... guided by one brain .
my children have separate brains , frank .
it' s just a figure of speech .
no , it isn' t .
hey , trust me .
one hour at sea together , gonna be best friends .
okay , prepare to come about !

do not waste it .
why do i suddenly feel like i' m in prison ?
fashion police caught up with you ? snap !
up top , girlfriend !
why the drill , admiral ?
it' s not a drill , william .
we have doubled our force .
that calls for increased coordination .
don' t worry , you' il soon be doing this in your sleep .
i am asleep .

just the good music .
hey .
hey !
forget about it .
what are you talking about ?
look , i' ve known nick for years .
he' s cute , but totally shallow .
then again , maybe he is your type .
where' s the admiral ?
i' m lodging a formal complaint against phoebe . she stinks !
he' s probably out dreaming up new ways to ruin our lives .
this is so ridiculous !
just because he got married , we all have to suffer .
not necessarily .
okay , what are you doing on dad' s computer ?
just making a few changes to the schedule .
unauthorized , of course .
now this i can live with .
come on !
i have to get ready for school .
your face isn' t big enough to hold that much makeup .
get a watch , hippie chick .
it' s my time . she' s right .
our time was first .
no way .
i checked the schedule last night .
those evil preppies must have changed it .
we should pound them !
yeah .
kick their butts .
to me , nothing says " time to get out of the bathroom " like ....
fire !

watch your backs .
where' s the fire ?
be quick .

come on , let' s go watch them !
nice towel , christina .
yeah , cute boxers , william .
you guys are so dead .
at least we' il be clean .
can i get the two of you guys closer together ?
naoko , what are you doing ?
webcasting .
say cheese .
come on , guys .
this is our talking stick .
and this is a " no judgment circle . " so whoever has the stick ... may express themselves without fear or interruption . so , william , why don' t you begin ?
go ahead .
just , you know , say what you need to .
wait .
one of you must have something to say .
okay , if i can interrupt ...
i' il take the talking stick .
okay , i have something to say .
in the interest of making this house a home ...
i have come up with a little chore chart .
you gotta be kidding me .
ls this a joke ?
charts are never a joke with the admiral .
look , mom , we gotta go .
we' re gonna be late .
let' s go .
yeah , let' s get out of here .
whoa !
whoa !
i want you all home right after school ... because we have to go out and requisition supplies .
dismissed .
let' s go .
that' s a nice chart , frank .
looks like you put a lot of work into it .
and this is definitely one of a kind .
give me that .
that was a disaster .
well , at least there' s no blood .
yet .
what are you doing ?
hey , christina .
you lied to me .
you said he was a loser .
he is a loser .
hey !
a very hot loser .

thanks for the warning , sis .
i' il be sure to return the favor , first chance i get .
she seems sweet .
hey , admiral , will you build me and aldo a sandbox ?

how' s it going ?
good .
i ordered us a part that' il have us up and running in no time .
you sure are putting a lot of effort into fixing that big old light bulb .
a lighthouse without a light is just a house .
and that' s a problem because ....
have i ever told you the story of the beautiful lighthouse keeper ?
the beautiful lighthouse keeper ?
no .
i think i would have remembered that .
well , once upon a time , there was a beautiful lighthouse keeper .
wait , wait .
i thought that lighthouse keepers ... were old men in yellow raincoats with long white beards .
oh , no .
this one was a real hottie . she had long red hair . she was tall ...
yeah . ... and her body , it was the bomb .
anyway , her man was a sailor .
oh , i love sailors .
and he was afraid that she' d find someone else whenever he was away .
no . so she said to him ...
as long as that light up there is lit ...
my heart will always be yours .
so , from then on , whenever he was away at sea ... he could just look back and he' d see that light ... and he knew that his true love still cared .
frank ?
yes , my beautiful lighthouse keeper .
we' re doing the right thing , aren' t we ?
we' ve had a bumpy start .
yeah .
come here , i wanna show you something .
okay .
look .
okay .
see that ?
that' s the buddy system .
we' re jelling as a family , even as we speak .
yeah .
you know , it just might work .
you have to turn it over .
i know , lau .
thicker , kelly , thicker .
i know .
otter and ely , playing outside .
ethan , aldo , playing inside .
marisa and bina ....
can we plant flowers ?
a garden ?
i think planting a garden would be lovely .
yay , a garden !
flowers are going to be fun . so that leaves time for a little drive .
i have this romantic spot i' ve been wanting to take you to .
i' il get my keys .
mrs. munion , would you mind watching the little kids for a while ?
oh , sure .
they' il be in full lockdown .

mrs. munion' s in charge .
finally , a moment alone .
excuse me .

we' re with quality control .
products testing .
i' m sorry .

no way .
over my dead body .
we need to unite against a greater enemy .
and that enemy' s name is mom and dad .
what are you talking about ?
he' s saying we are all totally incompatible ... but our parents don' t seem to care .

the admiral always does say , " a clean ship is a happy ship .
hey .
wow !
this place is shipshape .
well , you just had to , frank , didn' t you ?
excuse me ?
you know , frank ...
i understand your pathological need to organize the rest of the house ... but this is my space .
i need just a little bit of respect .
you' re killing me , frank .
did i miss something ?
yes .
don' t you think you' re overreacting just a little ?
me ?
you know what ?
never mind , frank .
you know , you were gonna spank the boys ... over wrecking your silly organizational chart ... but i' m not allowed to be upset about my studio .
i was not going to spank them .
and charts are not silly .
do you know what happens to a ship in chaos ?
it sinks .
homes are for free expression , not for good impressions .
well , i' m sorry , but in the military , there' s little room for free expression .
except for that we' re not in the military , frank .
you are .
i just thought that you would work better in a clean studio .
i knew it !
i knew you put them up to it .
i most certainly did not !
no , maybe not directly , but in that whole orderly , military ... regimented brainwashing thing .
you left out anal retentive .
oh , and that , too .
is that what you think ?
yes , that' s what i think .
then i think that i' m sleeping somewhere else .
i' m gonna fix that .
officer asleep .
go , kelly !
go , kelly !

ladies and gentlemen ... first of all , i wanna thank admiral beardsley and his wife helen ... for this wonderful evening .
frank , you run a tight ship .
you ought to see me on the water .
that' s why , tonight , i' m gonna offer my recommendation ... that admiral frank beardsley ... be my successor as commandant .
you know , frank , being commandant , you' il be at sea ... wishing that you were home .
or you' il be in washington , wishing that you were at sea !
let' s all stand and applaud ...
commandant frank beardsley .
thank you , commandant sherman .
i know that ... this command is an incredible opportunity ... and a great honor .
but i' ve just started here at the academy ... and it would not be fair to my cadets ... nor would it be fair to my new family ... who just about outnumber the cadets .
and so , sir ...
i must respectfully decline .
and i hope that you know how honored i am .
think you might reconsider ?
you wanna sleep on it ?
no , sir , i' m sure .
thank you .
i' il do it .
get a load of this guy .
you wanna sleep on it .
i understand .
all the girls and the boys and people making noises , let me hear you shout
bring them out , bring them out
pump up your fists in a twist like this till the lights go out
bring them out , bring them out
wake up , i' m calling you up i need a ride
we' re gonna shake up so hurry it up , no wasting time
what' s going on , baby ?
what are you doing ?
oh , don' t worry .
look , i' m making the money ... but i' m gonna split it with everybody , minus a 1 0 % service fee .
maybe with some other friends of mine
someone' s coming round to pick him up
right now i want the girls and the boys and people making noise
let me hear you shout
what is this ?
i didn' t order any beer .
don' t look at me .
i just wanted to break our parents up , not go to jail !
yeah , i don' t know why i even try
i didn' t order pizza .
well , somebody did .
and somebody owes me $379 , plus tip . $379 ?
plus tip .
i' il be right back .
gross .
yo , christina .

hey , nick .
phoebe' s out trying to raise money for pizza .
maybe i came to see you .
me ?
wow .
i can' t believe you' re really into me .
you' re hot .
why wouldn' t i be ?
i don' t know .
maybe because ...
phoebe is my sister .
hey , phoebe .
get lost , loser .
look , i' m really sorry .
no , no , i' m so sorry .
let' s promise never to let boys come between us again .
yeah , like that' s really gonna happen .
come on .
oh , no .
yo , what' s up , dude ?
let' s just take a deep breath , frank .
yo , b , nice hat .
ahoy , matey .
oh , boy .
jimi , i' ve been looking all over for  there you go .
phoebe !
hi .
what is going on here ?
mom said that we could have some people over .
you agreed to this ?
no .
phoebe , i said you could have a few friends over .
i did not agree to this .
where' s everybody else ?
where are the little kids ?
need more chocolate .
would everyone who lives here please raise your hand ?
anyone else remaining here after five minutes ... will be forcibly conscripted into the united states coast guard .
sir , there is the matter of $379 , plus
kitchen !
all right , everybody fall in !
i said , " fall in !
dylan , phoebe , i am very disappointed in both of you .
disappointed ?
is that what you are , helen ?
disappointed ?
william , christina , front and center .
frank , take it easy .
no , helen .
there has been enough taking it easy around here .
that clearly doesn' t work .
i should have never gone against my better judgment .
this is why we have rules .
do you hear yourself ?
because it' s not all about rules .
you sound like some military robot , frank !
yeah ?
well , you sound like a big free to be you and me flake .
you have one hour to get this place cleaned up .
there is nothing wrong with having rules .
everybody lives by them .
the entire universe lives by them .
well , then , frank , that' s the last thing these kids need from me .
there' s only one rule i know , and that' s ...
at any time , all of this could be over , taken away from you forever .
and then who needs more rules after that ?
i can' t live like this anymore , frank , and neither can my kids .
i don' t know how yours do it .
my kids got along just fine until we moved in together .
everything was shipshape .
oh , frank .
it' s obvious that we got into this way too fast .
i thought we could just pick up where we left off in high school .
but maybe that' s a lot longer ago than we both realized .
maybe it was .
hey , you know what , frank ?
i think you should take that job .
i told you , i don' t want to take the  no , just come on !
we both know what your better judgment is telling you , okay ?
you know what ?
just please go .
just go .
does this mean you' re not going to be my brother anymore ?
i don' t know .
let' s get this party started .
who wants a double stuffed ?
helen cried herself to sleep tonight .
we should be ashamed .
it' s all our fault .
yeah .
my mom was happier with your dorky dad than i' ve seen her in years .
and we totally screwed it up .
but this is what we wanted , remember ?
two separate families .
yeah , but i didn' t know it would feel like this .
yeah .
hello ?
hi .
it' s me .
hi .
i' ve been thinking a lot about what you said ... and i ....
i think maybe i will take that job .
well ... you know , frank , we have to talk to the kids .
i' il tell them .
okay .
well , i' il see you .
goodbye .
hey , look who it is .
it' s the freaks .
yeah , why don' t you go home to your shoe ? shut up !
did you just tell him to shut up ?
is there a problem , punk ?
what' s it to you ?
you mess with my brothers , you mess with me .

and me .
and me .
and me .
and me .
and me .
and me .
it' s all good .
otter , are these the kids that have a problem with big families ?
they say we share our underpants .
that' s just ignorance .
and do you know how to stop ignorance ?
education ?
close .
butt whupping .
let' s go !
come on !
hey , what' s going on , guys ?
just some kids messing with our little brothers .
but we handled it .
family style !
william !

does this mean that you move to the white house ?
way to go , willie .
couldn' t have done it without you , bro .
dad , guess what happened today at school ?
hey , i wanna tell him .
have you ever heard yourself tell a story ?
you have a tendency of rambling .
okay , listen up , guys !
i have something important to say .
we' re leaving ?
what ?
no .
do we have to leave ?
look , just ' cause you and mom had a little fight ...
that' s no reason  it was a big fight .
this whole thing is our fault .
we tried to make all of you live with people ... that you have nothing in common with ... and that was self centered of us .
it was pigheaded .
and i' d like to talk about this more ... but my ship sails in a half hour .
where are you going ?
i have to visit all the commands on the east coast ... to prep for my new job .
so let' s lose the long faces .
now , if you ever need anything , that means all of you north kids ... you just call me .
i' il be there .
got it ?

william , you know the routine .
mrs. munion will bring you down to washington once i get us set up .

doesn' t matter anymore .
