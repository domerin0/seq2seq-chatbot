sometimes , life is so perfect .
isn' t it ?
it has to be .
to make up for all the hard stuff it throws your way .
you have to learn to walk .
you have to learn to talk .
you have to wear that totally ridiculous hat your grandma bought you .
you have no say in the matter .
and when you' re a little older , even though you get to choose your hats , you don' t get to choose what they put in those meatballs at the cafeteria .
or when to fall in love .
things happen , and you just have to deal .
and breathe .
let' s just think of the day my parent' s divorce came through as ' big , ugly hat day . '
refer to diagram b on page 19 .
' the tree of life . '
and breathe .
anybody but his own selfish pleasure .
mom , please .
focus .
i couldn' t care less about your father' s midlife crisis and complete mockery of his wedding vows .
i just hope he doesn' t expect me to take ...
halley , i' m sorry .
i didn' t see you there .
guys ...
where do you think you' re going ?
as long as you' re gonna kill me with flying ice , does it matter ?
excuse me , everyone .
l ...
mom ?
sorry .
i have some really important news to announce here .
lewis and i ... we' re getting married .
he asked me last saturday night .
i wanted to tell you , but i wasn' t sure when , or how you' d react .
i told him i couldn' t even wear this ring until after i talked to you .
but we wanna have this big spring wedding .
mom , i' m so happy .
nice timing , huh ?
tell your mom you' re getting married on the day she gets divorced .
why does love make people crazy ?
scarlett , you weren' t picking up your phone .
i' m so sorry .
halley , that' s michael .
michael ...
hi .
thank you .
bye !
i love you !
what do you think ?
you didn' t tell me you were doing it .
when you meet the right person and you fall in love ...
it' s like ... it' s like everything you thought ... you thought is ...
can you believe it ?
no .
i can' t .
scarlett , come on .
you are sounding dangerously close to a hallmark greeting card .
you' re gonna let yourself turn into mush over something like sex ?
yeah .
you can' t expect to do anything great in life if you buckle the first time some guy bats his eyes at you .
news flash , hal .
even madonna eventually got married .
my mom thinks that means there' s hope for her , too .
your mom wants to get married ?
well , she wants to fall in love , halley .
everyone does .
hi .
i' ve been in ...
hi .
i' ve been divorced for a long time , so my baggage is ancient history .
i like to think that i travel light these days .
except for my daughter , scarlett , who is just a joy of a carryon .
i think i' m taking the baggage thing too far .
maybe i should start over .
you know what i think of this whole idea .
i' m only gonna send it to the online guys who pass my rigid five point checklist .
here , you try .
go away .
lydia .
the man of your dreams is sitting out there right now waiting to hear from you .
speak to him .
i don' t think the perfect man is gonna want to hear what i have to say .
sure he does , sweetie .
speak to him .
go on .
i' m sorry , mr. perfect ... but if you' re waiting for me , it' s gonna be a hell of a long wait .
see , i' ve had it with men like you .
i think it' s terrific that you have a great job , and you' re sensitive to the needs of others , and you jog three times a week to keep the belly at bay .
but the second some silicon breasted , butt kissing , airhead climber half your age comes along , you can' t keep your pants zipped .
well , fuck you !
that' s right , mr. middle age , think you' re a big shot , phony asshole .
you ain' t gettin ' any from me .
okay .
i think we' il just give this a little time .
so juvenile .
i' m glad you' re back early from camp , even though it was a dishonorable discharge .
what happened ?
where were you trying to get to in that canoe ?
no comment .
no comment ?
i don' t speak to the press .
i' m the press ?
yeah , and anything i say can and will be used against me , right ?
i would never use anything against you .
dad , give it up !
it' s old , and you need to get your own material .
daddy dog .
yo .
len martin .
it' s you , right ?
wdyg' s coolest dj .
that' s me .
' we dig the dog ! '
love your show , man .
thanks , man .
you are the hippest old guy i know .
yo , dude !
i' m not that old !
that' s len martin .
hello , gorgeous ones .
and you invited her .
hey , baby .
hey .
i thought we' d spend time together , then we could have a chance to bond .
well ...
look at you , halley .
that' s hard to do without a mirror , isn' t it ?
honey , you keep getting prettier every day .
i have no idea how you could say that , cause ... you definitely don' t see me every day , do you ?
and yesterday , my god , i was so ugly , and last wednesday ... that sucked , too .
so it' s kind of a day to day thing .
i love that sense of humor .
just like her daddy .
look at that gorgeous girl .
dad , stop it .
she' s got her daddy' s hair .
don' t cut it .
it' s beautiful .
don' t cut it .
just let it grow , let it grow .
don' t cut it .
cut it .
okay .
let me count the ways that this card can be used to induce ... nausea , gastric distress , vomiting .
yeah , go ahead and mock me , but this is serious .
i need to find something funny and something sweet ... just the way scarlett is .
remember last time i got her ...
okay .
look , here' s one .
not helping .
' from small beginnings come great things . '
' congratulations on your new baby . '
i thought you were gonna help .
lighten up , sherwood .
' the first time we met , you stole my heart . '
' good luck in finding a compatible organ donor . ' nice .
i' m kidding , okay ?
it' s blank inside .
you know something ?
you' re not too funny .
this girl is amazing ... unlike you ... and she' s sensitive ... unlike you .
and she' s sexy .
unlike you .
there' s gotta be a card ...
is that michael ?
for a redhead from ...
i can' t see .
a newly smitten hunka hunka burning love .
i mean ...
look .
summer romance has its own section .
it' s not a summer romance .
i mean ...
scarlett is ...
standing right behind you , dude .
hi .
sneaking up on me ?
hi , halley .
hi .
you remember my name ?
sure .
we were in biology together .
yeah , i know , but ... well , you were never there , really ... technically .
i like your hair .
thank you .
see , my schedule is all wrong , which i think is a sign that nothing' s going according to plan this year .
it' s a complete and total mess .
looks like a fine schedule to me .
no .
band ?
i would never sign up for band .
what' s wrong with band ?
i don' t play anything .
well , maybe you should .
i' m sure you can handle it .
mrs. toussaint , this is not my schedule .
look , i' m signed up for algebra , and i' ve already taken calculus .
maybe a brush up is a good thing , not to mention a good grade .
why don' t you just give it a shot before you decide anything ?
okay , i' m signed up for boys ' p. e. 94 fm fill out this form .
daddy dog .
we' il start again .
len martin with a traffic update from that love puppy in the skies , our very own lorna queen .
lorna , you up there ?
hi , len .
on a clear day , you can see forever , and this is one beautiful morning .
should we tell everyone our little secret ?
careful .
baby , you sure this is the time ?
i am bursting at the seams to tell everyone we' re eloping .
i just spilled the beans .
that is your father' s show , right ?
i just love it .
hi .
tell him congratulations .
i' m sure you' re very excited about the upcoming nuptials .
my father and my sister .
my sister and my father ?
your father and your sister are getting married ?
yeah .
no , not to each other .
i ...
i have to check something before i fill this out .
sit down , forrester .
let' s see if we can sort out your usual chaos .
maybe you' il even do us the honor of attending this year .
okay , later , m. t. i gotta rethink that shop class .
i' m pretty scary with tools .
my .
you didn' t know about your dad getting married ?
yes , i did .
the bastard tells the whole world before he tells you .
he' s not ...
whatever .
at least if they' re eloping , you won' t have to go the wedding .
weddings are the worst .
me ?
i' ve had to go to , like , five between my parents .
don' t ask .
listen , m. t. wasn' t giving you a hard time back there , was she ?
' m. t. ' ?
mrs. toussaint and i ... we' re on close terms .
you get to know your guidance counselor really well when you' re clearly in desperate need of guidance .
see , i' ve got it down to a science .
you try the jedi mind trick .
what' s that ?
you never saw star wars ?
no , i saw it .
i guess i just didn' t memorize it like you did .
well , that' s your loss , isn' t it ?
because the jedi mind trick is when you tell someone what to think , and they think it .
for example , m. t. says ,
' macon , you' re already in trouble , and it' s the first day of school .
is this any way to start the new year ? '
pretend you' re me .
now what do you say ?
okay .
i say ...
no .
i wanna be someone else .
cute .
no .
you as me say ...
mrs. t , you' re gonna let this one slide because it was an honest mistake , it' s only the first day of school , and the fire was put out as quickly as it was started .
you didn' t really start a fire , did you ?
the point is that you put the words into somebody' s mouth and they give them back like they' ve come up with the idea .
like when i ask you to go out this friday night , you' re gonna think you' re asking me because you' re gonna say ,
' i would love to go out with you
' because i know we' il have a great time together .
in fact , i' ve been hoping you' d ask me all week . '
you wanna go out on a date with me ?
see ?
i told you you' d ask me .
macon , i think i like you too much already to actually go out with you .
what kind of logic is that ?
it' s logical logic .
the quickest way to ruin a relationship with someone is to actually try to have a relationship with them .
haven' t you noticed when the opposite sex gets together , eventually someone ends up getting hurt ?
i am , too ... boycotting .
you can' t boycott your father' s wedding .
it' s not even a wedding .
it' s ... an elopement .
yeah , except everyone within his radio frequency is invited .
my god .
he is such a hypocrite .
i cannot believe he wouldn' t tell us about it first .
he didn' t give any warning when you went dinner ?
none .
she was at that dinner ?
no .
okay , yeah .
she was there at the end .
mom , come on .
she wasn' t even supposed to be there .
you know , i don' t think i' m gonna let him walk me down the aisle .
please stop worrying about me .
i am fine .
i' m fine .
in a way , it sets me free .
i feel strangely liberated .
and he is still your father , after all , and if he wants to make a complete and utter fool of himself by trying in some pathetically clich fashion to recapture his sorry state of manhood , by hooking up with not even a very attractive bimbo ... then if that' s what he wants , i' m fine with that .
someone toss , please .
now .
this is our reception area .
with out post ceremony champagne bar ... which is conveniently located right next to our very own chapel .
can' t you picture walking down this aisle ?
in a coffin .
sorry , it' s just ... a little depressing .
actually , nobody' s ever said that before .
lewis ... say something .
what do you think ?
well , i like it .
it' s very clean .
clean ?
is that what you want our wedding day to be ?
clean ?
it' s not ... it' s not pretty , it' s not intimate , it' s not romantic .
i' m just so happy that i get to marry you .
i' m sorry , not to pressure you , but this space does book up quickly for spring .
we have another couple ...
why don' t we give them a moment to think .
ashley , sweetie , they plan the whole thing .
the food , the flowers ... even the place cards .
think about how much less hassle it' il be .
you think planning the most important day of our lives is a hassle ?
it hasn' t even been that long .
191/ 2 hours .
wouldn' t michael look cool in that ?
hey , i did a good job .
michael sherwood would look good in anything .
that' s not the point , though , okay ?
enjoy him , and fool around with him .
don' t fall in love with him .
why do you think they call it ' falling , ' anyways ?
it' s not worth it to you to spend on a wedding .
it' s the most important day .
i was trying to kill two birds with one stone .
cheap is what that is .
you see cheap , i see convenience .
look at them .
they' re like a walking warning sign against romance .
lewis is this anal , uptight geek who has my sister under some spell .
now all this formerly semi intelligent person thinks about is diamonds and hairdos and bullshit .
it' s like k mart .
how am i supposed to know what it looks like ?
maybe go by and look at it ?
or maybe ...
see ?
they don' t even like each other .
but this stupid spell they' re under makes them disregard all the facts .
they are fighting because they love each other enough to care .
i didn' t know it looked like a k mart before i went there .
once we got in there , you knew .
i made a mistake .
too bad you can' t get a divorce before getting married .
you could save yourself in that stupid extra step .
i' m sorry .
see ?
what are you looking for ?
these dishes , they' re perfect .
that' s love , halley .
okay , fall once and you may never be able to get back up again .
geek !
get out of here .
isn' t he adorable ?
he' s cute .
all right , michael !
way to get that goal !
okay , guys , line up !
okay , back up .
let' s give him some air .
sherwood ?
you hear me ?
guys , back up .
give him some air , all right ?
call the doctor .
i thought my parents ' divorce was the end of the world .
that was before michael died of a heart defect .
and the world stopped .
or it should have .
i' m sorry .
what do you think ?
i think it' s 100 degrees out .
what am i supposed to do ?
the only black clothes i have are winter clothes .
i have nothing nice to wear .
i don' t think it matters , really .
look , this is ... this is dark green and it' s really nice .
it' s ugly , halley .
i' m just trying to think about something else .
anything , for one single second .
i wanna look good for him .
does that sound crazy ?
this was a bad idea .
yeah , but dying is definitely not one of the better concepts .
no , the dress .
everyone' s looking at me like i' m a freak .
okay , it' s not for them .
it' s for michael .
remember that .
can you believe what she' s wearing ?
that' s , like , so disrespectful .
she always has to have all the attention to herself .
' although it droop and die that night , it was the plant and flower of light .
in small proportions , we just beauty see .
and in short measures ,
life may perfect be .
mr. macon forrester will now address us .
i was gonna read from this ...
but i' m not very good at reading .
or writing ... or spelling .
not like michael .
he was good at so many things without even trying .
he taught me how to be myself .
by myself .
not to worry about what other people think .
even if that means being completely uncool .
he taught me about how to trust people .
and how to love .
' cause he was so good .
he loved his family , he loved his friends .
he loved basketball .
and he loved scarlett .
and he loved this .
take this woman , lorna queen , to be your lawful wedded wife , your partner , the queen of your heart , forever and ever ?
yeah !
daddy , rock on with your woman !
and do you , lorna p. queen , take this old guy len to be your lawfully wedded husband for all the rest of your days ?
i do .
wrap it up .
we' re off in 15 seconds .
go .
our airtime is almost up .
we must now go where federal regulations will not allow you to follow , if you know what i mean .
lewis , no barking .
sorry , but you gotta go .
poor little thing .
i know just how it feels .
out with the old , in with the new .
and who do you think you are ?
just because you' ve got great petals .
my god .
i' m talking to my plants .
my god .
you' re talking to your plants .
how was it ?
it was great ... if you happen to be the devil and enjoy human pain .
tell me something .
i don' t know !
what do you want me to tell you ?
wait !
no , the bimbo almost died of strangulation .
i cannot believe i forgot to tell you .
her wedding veil took on a life of its own and rebelled , and she had to claw her way out .
and you know that woman can claw .
it was so sad .
it was like ... near death by wedding veil .
just tragic , isn' t it ?
my god !
and their vows ?
was dad that much a loser when you guys got married ?
i' m sorry .
your father' s not a loser .
although he did choose to look like one at our wedding , too .
he insisted on wearing a powder blue tuxedo .
then why do people get married , anyways ?
we know they' re lying to each other , but are they lying to themselves , too ?
how can you promise you' re gonna feel the same way forever ?
things do sometimes change , halley .
this house is awfully big for just the two of us , don' t you think ?
what ?
you' il be going to college soon .
mom ... a year and 3/ 4 is not really that soon .
i want to start thinking about streamlining .
maybe we should sell the house .
i grew up in this house .
yes , and there have been some great memories in this house .
this is my house .
i understand how you must feel , but life changes .
this is ridiculous , mom !
come on !
and i don' t want to live here alone .
i have to give him a ride .
bye , halley .
stand back !
leaf man to the rescue .
where did you get that ?
a guy' s gotta pay for gas and bacon burgers somehow , right ?
and toys , ' cause i imagine
star wars figurines must get pretty expensive .
i do not have any star wars figurines .
not many , and i don' t play with them ... much .
this one' s on the house .
okay .
here you go .
you' re afraid to go out with me because you might like me ?
no , but that' s a good theory , i guess , if you want to protect your fragile male ego .
' cause you can' t handle rejection .
rejection ?
whatever !
of course you think it' s weird that i didn' t just use the phone , but you' re also glad because it' s much better to talk in person .
especially when i' ve come with such a specific purpose .
which is why you' re gonna cut me some slack .
you are absolutely crazy .
i' ve been called worse .
you' re gonna kiss me , halley .
you' re gonna come a little closer ...
so i can put my arms around you .
and on the count of three ... two ... one .
you' re a really good kisser .
you tricked me .
you jedi mind tricked me .
halley , is that you out there ?
close your eyes .
go to bed .
give me a break .
who are you talking to ?
i' m sorry , i ...
sorry .
i just ...
i needed to talk .
i was just coming over for a little late night chat .
we' re not gonna stay up very late , okay ?
at least do it inside .
' nausea ' ?
a little .
' breast tenderness ' ?
yeah .
major .
' food cravings ' ?
grapefruit .
come on , i could answer ' yes ' to most of these questions , too .
i used to hate grapefruit .
what' s wrong ?
no offense , halley , but ... your perfume is making me sick .
come on , i' m not wearing perfume .
i use soap .
' heightened sense of smell . '
okay , so do you prefer direct pee on a strip or dip in a cup ?
maybe it' s a false reading .
because i have heard of things such as false readings .
and the strips did not look completely pink , only kind of pinkish , so ...
five kits , halley .
what am i gonna do ?
so you take the car without my permission in the middle of the night on some kind of joy ride .
it wasn' t a joy ride .
maybe i should ...
don' t think you' re off the hook .
you don' t even have your license , and you are a terrible driver .
i was helping scarlett get some books at school ... we left them ...
forget it , halley !
mom ... taking your car out is gonna seem like the least of it ... because whatever you' re thinking right now ... it' s worse .
one of you better tell me before i have a nervous breakdown .
i' m pregnant .
well , thank god you told me in time .
shouldn' t i be getting paid to wear a dress this ugly ?
i' m sorry if you hate my taste and you think it' s so awful you have to be in my wedding , but you are my sister .
it' s an emotional time .
all right .
i was just joking .
just because you think up something you think is funny , doesn' t mean you say it .
okay , ashley , i' m sorry , all right ?
it' s just ...
i love the dress , really .
i feel like a princess .
you know ?
i look awful .
we' il fix it .
it' s not the dress that needs fixing .
it' s me .
ashley , would you drive halley home ?
i have to get back to work .
give me my money back , you stupid , lying , feckless , two timing son of a bitch !
can i help you , ma' am ?
it stole my money , so , just ...
here .
this works a little better sometimes .
what' s your pleasure ?
diet coke sounds good .
the last one .
on me .
i hope i didn' t , you know , kick it too ...
i think these machines are built to withstand a good booting every now and then .
steve beckwith .
lydia martin .
did i say ' martin ' ?
it' s lydia williams now .
lydia williams again .
williams , again ?
nice to meet you .
thank you .
aren' t you gonna wear lipstick ?
you sound like mom .
can one of you zip me , please ?
you guys know you' re wearing the same dress , right ?
unbelievable .
you' re grandmother' s in there changing .
we practically are .
i' il change .
no , i' il change .
i can change .
no , i shouldn' t wear black , anyway .
halley , could you please wear something a little more feminine ?
because the warshers are really traditional .
thank you .
sweetheart , do you need the loo ?
grandma , no .
i' m gonna use the one downstairs .
don' t be silly .
come on in .
okay .
i' m almost through .
it smells like ...
just burning a little incense .
mother ?
are you smoking the cannabis again ?
i had a little headache .
but i' m feeling really much better now .
i knew we' d be late .
we' re fine .
his parents are promptness nuts .
i can' t believe i' m late .
that' s what happens when you make people change ten times .
these leaves would make a wonderful textile .
halley , look .
i' il bet if we make sheets of this pattern , we' d make a million dollars !
mother , please , not now .
she' s high .
she' s not high , she' s medicated .
it' s interesting ... when you make the ' ow ' sound , your mouth does this funny thing in the corner .
you' re not sick anymore .
you were only allowed to use weed when you were sick .
could you ring the bell ?
i do get headaches a lot .
smile .
does anyone else hear wind chimes or is it just me ?
this is a total disaster .
shit !
hello .
now , i know it' s turkey day , but we thought squab would be most special .
they' re absolutely adorable .
squab .
can i say i' m a vegetarian ?
no .
it reminds me of a little yellow parakeet i had when i was a girl .
such a sweet , smart little bird .
they look wonderful .
thank you .
marcella' s such a truly magnificent cook .
we are lucky to have found her .
i bet there' s a story in that .
tell me , how lost were you before you were found ?
because you look like a lady who doesn' t get lost very often .
grandma .
she came with us 20 years ago , when we moved here from atlanta .
she really raised our lewis .
i didn' t realize you were a working mother .
i wasn' t .
she did go through a brokerage training program .
she was good .
killer instinct .
but she set her sights on me , instead .
i' d say i got the best deal at the firm .
he' s all right .
he' s no clark gable ... but then very few men are .
what was the name of that character ?
ashley .
no , you' re ashley .
the wedding plans are coming along beautifully .
well , you holler if you need any help at all , understand ?
i want this to be a memorable affair .
carol does throw one heck of a luncheon .
that is my one regret about not having more children .
having girls must be such fun .
but we always felt that having an only child was a much better way to mold and shape character .
ashley was alone for her first six years .
i like to think she got the best of both worlds .
my best friend is an only child .
she' s having a baby , which at our age is something that obviously wasn' t planned .
and her mom is not really thrilled about the whole situation , but i really think she' s kind of starting to get behind it now , so ...
which way to the bathroom ?
down the hall and to your left .
isn' t it a surprise ... our children choosing to get married so young ?
i always thought lewis would take his time to find the right person .
well , it must be the example of you and dad .
i mean ... you make marriage seem so fun .
and ashley' s a lot like you , mom .
she' s a very determined woman .
open the door , halley .
young lady ?
open the door .
are you all right ?
lovely evening .
thank you .
thanks for sticking up for me .
what are you talking about ?
your mom obviously doesn' t want you to get married .
you made it sound like i' m some desperate woman somehow forcing you into the whole thing .
i did not .
' ashley' s a very determined woman . '
i didn' t say that .
i have witnesses !
mom , you were there .
you did say something along those lines .
well , that is not how i meant it .
lewis , you have a lovely family and that is what is important .
they weren' t exactly lovely to you .
' oh , you actually work for a living , you lower class , pathetic divorce ? '
ashley , enough .
i' m the one who got humped by a dog in there .
where are we ?
you' il see when we get there .
it' s too dark to see .
well , just hold on .
me and sherwood found this place a couple years ago .
we used to come here .
you like it ?
yeah .
yeah , come on .
let' s dance .
no .
yes .
come on , macon .
no .
please ?
come on , macon .
no .
please .
you look great , but i just ...
michael' s parents moved to florida .
you still have to tell them .
i know .
i just can' t figure out what to say that makes any sense .
which makes sense , given that none of what' s happened makes any sense .
you know , it' s weird .
because if you were the one that was pregnant ...
i would understand you considering having an abortion or putting the baby up for adoption .
you can still put the baby up for adoption .
no .
i know all the arguments .
and i know what i' m giving up .
and i know that nothing is gonna be normal for me anymore .
but what is normal , anyway ?
growing up with my mom sure wasn' t .
losing michael wasn' t .
i used to think that my family was the picture perfect example of normal .
us .
maybe being abnormal is what' s normal ... right ?
yeah , like you and macon .
it doesn' t make sense ... you falling in love with a guy like him .
i' m not falling in love with him , i like kissing him .
we' re just friends .
with benefits .
shut up .
bye , i' m leaving .
you' ve got it bad .
i hope this isn' t a bad time .
i know this is awfully forward of me , but ...
i can' t stop thinking about you .
you' re out of uniform .
that .
i forgot i was wearing that .
didn' t i explain ?
i' m a civil war reenactor ... a little hobby .
i like thinking about a time when honor and chivalry really meant something .
i know i' ve been slow to take action .
slows good .
would dinner tonight be too fast ?
yes .
i mean , no .
i mean , i' d love to .
cheers .
friends ?
friends .
steve , i had a lovely time .
good night .
i was just ...
you were just leaving .
exactly .
this is how you conduct yourself in your own home ?
you said it ... my own home .
that implies i have a right to choose what i do .
halley marie martin , conduct unbecoming .
no !
you never told me you were serious about this boy .
i' m not serious .
that' s what you do with people you' re not serious about ?
you know what ?
maybe if you had a little bit more fun , you wouldn' t be in the position you' re in right now .
where is all this attitude coming from ?
this is not like you .
like me ?
you don' t even know me .
maybe you' re just not very good at knowing people .
how well do you know that strange boy ?
mom , he' s not strange , okay ?
his name is macon .
and maybe if you paid attention to anyone ...
god forbid ... besides yourself and ashley and her stupid wedding , you would know that .
i' m trying .
halley , you used to talk to me .
yeah , and you were too busy hating dad to listen .
i' m sorry you' ve had to go through this .
i hate dad ... so much for doing this to us .
i hate him , i hate him .
and then i don' t hate him , and i feel bad for hating him ...
sweetie , i don' t want you to hate your father .
he' s a decent man .
i don' t want you to hate me either , but i am going to have to start laying down some rules around here .
here we go .
halley , you' re grounded until next year .
no .
you promised me that i could go to the new year' s eve party with macon ...
mom , please !
no .
no buts , no new year' s eve , no macon .
god !
' dear mr. and mrs. sherwood ...
guess what ?
you' re gonna be grandparents ' ...
exclamation point .
why don' t you try telling michael' s parents what you really feel ?
macon land .
happy new year .
happy new year .
hey , macon , the man .
hi .
the party' s just arrived .
the party has ...
i' m here .
yeah .
okay .
hold still .
sorry .
now , you are pretty .
come on , you can smile better than that .
what ?
she doesn' t know how to smile ?
maybe she doesn' t want to .
well , excuse me for breathing .
yeah , you' re breathing too close .
sorry about this .
it' s okay .
happy new year .
happy new year .
here' s to the new year , right ?
yeah , right .
to the ... to the new year .
okay , knock knock .
police raid .
hey , macon , my man ... what' s up ?
what' s up with you ?
i lost my damn earring .
hey , macon .
hi , halley .
hi .
thanks .
nice name .
who wants to see my ferret ?
dude , i have one .
come on , dude .
i put a little hat on him and everything .
it' s awesome .
so , when' s scarlett due , anyway ?
you know ?
yeah , my mom' s a bookkeeper in her doctor' s office , but ... don' t worry .
i haven' t told anyone .
third week of may .
god , that is so freaky .
you know , it' s weird , but ...
i didn' t even know they had hooked up .
really ?
they went out all summer .
did they ?
yeah , and he was completely in love with her .
she' s ruining her life , you know .
i think i' d kill myself before i had a baby .
i know enough to know i wouldn' t be able to handle it .
you' re probably right , because you' re not scarlett .
right .
thank god for that .
what' s wrong ?
i' m sorry .
halley , where are you going ?
ten , nine , eight , seven , six , five , four , three , two , one .
i' m sorry .
i really am .
what was that all about ?
i thought you wanted us to be together .
i do ... but , ' together ' ?
it' s so official and so big for us .
maybe you should just say what you feel for once .
i could do that .
i can .
i can .
i felt like i had to get out of there because i might ... really ... care about you , and ...
and it scared me so much because that meant that ... you could hurt me .
or maybe i just didn' t feel ready .
to like someone ... that much .
and i like you .
don' t make it so complicated , halley .
some people fall in love .
i had to crash into it .
hey , baby .
hi .
i' m sorry .
you gave us quite a scare .
god .
and i ruined your party , too .
i' m not concerned with the party .
your date with steve .
i know that was so important to you .
halley , i know you were with macon forrester .
mom , it was not his fault , though .
we were trying to leave this really bad party .
he was letting me drive ... you know i' m like the worst driver , and i could not even see ...
halley , save your strength .
you' re gonna need it to come up with better excuses .
macon wasn' t there when i woke up .
macon wasn' t there when i left .
macon wasn' t there the whole next week at school .
what do you expect when you break your own rules ?
any word from him ?
no .
i guess that' s what guys are good at , right ?
disappearing ?
hey .
i' m back .
you really don' t get it , do you ?
i' m really not in the mood to wait for you to grow up .
my ... are you okay ?
hi , halley .
i think i just dropped my keys .
no , they' re in the door .
come on .
stop spinning !
stop spinning .
i' m not spinning !
quiet !
maybe you should be quiet .
that' s what you should do .
upstairs .
halley , you' re such a good sister .
you think i' m doing those ?
i am not doing those .
be careful .
christ , halley .
it' s all right .
this is my bachelorette party .
i am a bachelorette .
thank you , little sister .
you are the greatest .
okay , ashley , please just take this .
jesus .
what ...
you just ...
please .
come on .
mom is upstairs sleeping .
mom' s not home .
really ?
and how would you know that ?
friday night she sneaks out to have sex with steve .
she told you that ?
she didn' t want you to know .
god , why do people think that i can' t handle the truth ?
go on , you hatchet faced scarecrow !
you baboon !
you bag of bones !
you old weasel face !
sourpuss !
sorry old flabby nincompoop !
top of the morning to you .
how is she ?
sweetie .
a hangover kit .
not to appear superior , but i did limit myself to one glass of champagne , thank you very much .
if it wasn' t for halley , i would' ve died , probably .
no , you just would' ve woken up on the porch .
bet the neighbors would' ve loved that .
right , especially with the men' s underwear around her neck .
underwear ?
it was nothing .
it was stupid .
underwear is not nothing .
no , they were pretty much nothing .
we promised each other no strippers .
i know , lewis , i know , but i was at the mercy of my friends .
don' t promises we make to each other mean anything ?
of course they mean something , lewis .
god , don' t be so uptight !
i' m uptight ?
i' m not uptight !
yes , lewis , you are .
you are uptight .
you know what else ?
halley was right about you .
you have got a broomstick up your butt .
i never said that !
okay , well , guess who put it there ?
don' t talk to me that way .
maybe i' il find somebody fun !
to tell the truth , you' re no fun !
we made a promise to each other , but you don' t keep it because you' re self absorbed .
don' t talk to me that way .
hello .
good morning , halley .
what' s going on ?
i think they' re breaking up .
relax .
you' re no fun .
marriage is a promise , and a promise has to be kept .
not every argument leads to a breakup .
for real !
the wedding is off .
i' ve been trying to say i' m sorry .
i' m sorry doesn' t always cut it , macon !
i couldn' t stay with you at the hospital .
i know i should have , but think how much more freaked out your mom would' ve got if she' d have seen me .
my god .
okay .
wow , thank you so much .
so , you were ditching me for my own benefit .
no , that' s not it .
i didn' t ditch you .
l ...
okay , i ...
i freaked out .
i' m not used to feeling this way about somebody .
and i just ...
i couldn' t believe i almost lost you , too .
here .
come on , i' il help you eat them .
no .
i don' t want any .
i can' t see you anymore .
your mom will get over it .
it' s not my mom .
it' s me .
and , of course , if you do decide to get married ,
i can get my makeup and hair people to do you on the big day .
if you decide not to get married ,
i think you should let them do some work on you anyway , because you are gonna want to look your best when you get back out there .
darling , there is nothing wrong with canceling a wedding .
no , it' s indefinitely postponed .
that' s what we' re supposed to say officially .
my mom found out .
actually , i haven' t really made up my mind yet , so if everybody could just ...
honey .
give me a hug .
sweetie , you never know what' s gonna happen .
okay ?
for a while there , i thought i' d never get married .
finally , i had to put my foot down or my guy here would never have left ...
i' il get that .
hello ?
honey , it' s their mother calling from virginia .
it seems your grandmother had a bad fall .
your mother wants you to meet her there .
do you think she' s okay in there ?
it has been a while .
grandma , are you all right ?
yes , i' m just smoking a little marijuana .
look at that pattern .
is it just me , or is that the spittin ' image of abraham lincoln ?
look , halley , look .
there' s the mole .
halley , you must see it !
you' re the one who sees things no one else can see .
i do ?
yes .
mother , you' re not supposed to be walking yet .
next time you fall like that , you' re going to break your hip , then die .
you remember when we went to see our comet together ?
halley was too young to remember that .
no , i do remember .
you can' t possibly .
you remember hearing about it .
no , mom , i do remember .
why does no one trust me to know what i know anymore ?
god .
god !
she doesn' t even think that my own memories belong to me .
darling , she' s your mother .
now , tell me about this fella of yours .
who told you about that ?
grandma , it' s really over .
first loves are never really over .
nobody' s perfect , sweetheart .
but that doesn' t mean it wasn' t worth your while .
boy !
do i have the munchies !
what about him ?
he' s not terrible looking .
yeah , he' s even cute in that geeky way that you like guys , ashley .
halley , it' s ...
it' s lewis .
ashley , love of my life ...
life of my heart ... once again ... will you marry me ?
yes .
yes .
how crazy .
i can' t believe it .
do it .
i owe you one .
for ?
macon' s a really great guy .
see ya , halley .
hey .
hi .
i had no idea that you guys were like ... hanging out .
elizabeth gunderson and me ?
no , we' re just ...
friends ?
yeah .
right .
no , it' s fine because we had our thing , and it was fun ... until it wasn' t anymore , right ?
no , that' s not it .
when the going gets tough , it' s best to just keep going , don' t you think ?
would you listen to me for a sec ?
and to my bride .
thank you for showing me that socks don' t need to be ironed ... that one needn' t employ the dewey decimal system for their cd collection ... and that , in the end , it doesn' t make a whole lot of difference whether you start the toilet paper facing up or down .
despite what my parents taught me .
because , ashley , you have shown me that life is worth embracing .
even if it means making a giant fool of yourself .
and lucky for me , you' re willing to marry the guy who' s been the biggest fool of all .
so here' s to a lifetime of big , messy , wonderfully out of order moments with the most beautiful woman in the world ... my bride .
your big sister is getting married in 31/ 2 hours .
you know if you get nervous , you can always ...
you remember the sign .
of course .
you taught it to me , remember ?
so , you know .
just ...
like that .
i' il do something .
i' il yell , ' fire , ' okay ?
okay .
okay .
and we' re back with the big dog of soft rock ,
wdyg , 94 fm .
' we dig the dog . '
this is daddy dog himself , len martin , coming to you today on a very special day ,
' cause one of my very own puppies ... the eldest ...
ashley , is getting married .
lorna , honey , any words of wisdom coming from you , my very own newlywed ?
waterproof mascara .
i' m gonna borrow yours , ' cause daddy' s gonna be weeping like a baby .
all right , let' s kick off this power hour of love .
are you there ?
security ?
hey , give me ... come on .
this is my job !
my halley ?
i don' t know how to get you to listen , but maybe ...
let him talk .
just hear me out .
i suck with words .
but sometimes , words aren' t the thing .
love isn' t about words , it' s about what you do .
and what i did ... running away , it was stupid .
we both know love' s a big , scary , evil concept .
but if you feel it , it' s gonna follow you around like a hungry dog no matter how far you run .
wait .
i didn' t mean to say love' s a dog .
i just mean , i' m not going anywhere .
i love you , halley .
if love beats us up , let' s beat it up right back .
we could do this .
if you' re ready to make the jump , i' il be right here to catch you .
and what a powerful power hour of love it has been .
this is len martin for wdyg , the big dog of soft rock .
that' s right .
romance is in the air .
it' s everywhere here today , folks .
this next song is going out to that young lady in question ...
miss halley martin and her big sister ashley ,
' cause daddy loves you .
you look beautiful .
you look beautiful , mom .
i' m not too old to wear pink ?
no .
i look like a giant helium balloon .
come on .
we have to go .
i' m gonna walk over .
i' il meet you there .
let' s get halley !
back seat .
i need to lie down .
please be seated .
we have come together today to join in holy matrimony
ashley renee martin and lewis gibson warsher il .
if any among you know any reason why this couple may not lawfully be married , declare it now or forever hold your peace .
do you , lewis , promise to love , honor , and cherish ashley from this day forward , for richer or for poorer , in sickness and in health , forsaking all others as long as you both shall live ?
i do .
and do you , ashley , promise to love , honor , and cherish lewis for richer or for poorer , in sickness and in health , forsaking all others as long as you both shall live ?
i do .

it' s okay .
you' re gonna have the baby !
thank you so much .
thanks .
you have got to do something .
that was just a dreadful scene .

one empty seat throws everything off .

we' re gonna get there .
i assume daddy would like to be in the delivery room ?

baby !
mommy !
hi , sweetie .
i need you .
i' m her mother .
miss smith ?
it' s okay .
thank you .
don' t leave me .
so , do you hate me ?
not you , per se .
i hate the way your hair falls in your face .
and i hate the way your voice gets really low when you' re serious .
and i hate the way you bite your bottom lip when you' re nervous .
and the way your eyebrow goes ... like that .
i hate that .
so , that' s it ?
you just hate the way i walk and talk and look ?
no .
that jedi mind trick thing ?
i hate that .
don' t give up on me .
i' m not .
but you are gonna regret ever having messed up .
' cause i' m gonna make you pay for a long time .
but first ...
you' re going to take three steps towards me .
and you' re going to wrap your arms around my waist .
and on the count of three ... two ...
we' re gonna dance .
