aziz .
aziz .
aziz , light !
aziz ...

we start again .
when the three planets are in eclipse ... the black hole , like a door , is open .
evil comes ... spreading terror and chaos .
see the snake , billy ?
the ultimate evil .
make sure you get the snake .
yes , i' ve got your snakes .
i got all the snakes .
when is the snake act supposed to occur ?
if this is the five ... and this is the one ...
every 5, 000 years .
so , i' ve got some time then .
you bring them water .
good boy .
i' il take it to them .
go with god .
be safe from evil .
you see here these different peoples , or symbols of people ... gathering the four elements of life ... water , fire , earth , air ... around a fifth one .
a fifth ... element .
forgive me , lord .
they already know too much .
father .
how are you ?
well .
you have some glasses ?
of course .
i' m so glad to see you .
it' s the most extraordinary thing .
it' s the greatest find in history .
you must be parched .
oh , yes , yes .
i' m sorry .
it' s like a battle plan .
here the good .
here the evil .
and here , a weapon ... against evil .
i' m going to be famous .
then let us toast to your fame .
to fame .
salute .
you can' t toast with water .
billy , in my sack , the grappa .
this i don' t understand .
this could be something ... prehistoric .
i don' t know .
but , wait .
here .
look , look .
they' re here .
this man ... this perfect being .
i know this is the key .
i know it .
this divine light they talk about .
what is divine light ?
aziz , light !
much better .
thank you .
my lord .
father , this is the most unbelievable thing i' ve ever seen .
don' t you think ?
are you german ?
lord ...
i know he was about to discover everything .
but , no worry .
i was there in time .
priest ... you and those before you ... have served us well .
but war is coming .
stones not safe on earth anymore .
this ... is really amazing .
the fifth element .
take the stones .
my lord ... if you take the weapon , we' il be defenseless ... when evil returns .
in 300 years ... when evil returns ... so shall we .
oh , professor .
professor .
don' t move !
i have a gun !
please , understand .
they' re our friends .
friends ?
father , they' ve killed the professor !
they' re monsters !
i' il explain everything .
you' re with them ?
look at me .
i am your friend .
no , father .
billy , look at me !
please , put ... the gun down .
billy , no !
hurry !
the wall is closing !
pass your knowledge to the next priest ... as it was passed to you .
i will do as you command , but ... hurry , you still have time .
time not important .
only life ... important .
i will fulfill my mission !
you can count on me !
i will pass the knowledge until your return .
anything yet ?
not even a temperature ?
the analyzers have jammed .
one shows a million degrees , the others minus 5, 000 .
let' s see it .
it' s taking shape .
send out a probe .
ladies and gentlemen ... the president of the federated territories .
on air with general staedert in 30 seconds .
i saved this seat for you , father .
president on the line .
we' re in position .
i have to address the supreme council .
just the facts .
there are no results from the chemical and molecular analysis yet .
all the calibers are overshot .
we' re initiating thermonucleatic imaging .
what you' re saying is , you don' t know what this is .
all we know is , it just keeps getting bigger .
recommendation ?
my philosophy is shoot first and ask questions later .
i don' t like uninvited guests .
all right , then .
mr. president ?
priest vito cornelius , expert of astrophenomenon .
i ... have a different theory to offer you , sir .
you have 20 seconds .
imagine that this ... thing is not anything that can be identified ... because it prefers not to be .
wherever there is life ... it brings death ... because it' s evil .
absolute evil .
one more reason to shoot first .
evil begets evil , mr. president .
shooting will only make it stronger .
probe will obtain objective in five seconds .
growth rate is at 27 % .
your theory is interesting , but we don' t have time to go into it .
time is of no importance .
only life is important .
you' re right .
that' s exactly what we' il do .
we' il protect the life of 200 billion of my fellow citizens .
you may fire when ready .
up front loading of a 120 zr missile .
marker lights on the objective .
its structure solidified on the surface .
i think it' s anticipating the attack .
that denotes intelligence .
the most ... terrible intelligence imaginable .
120' s loaded .
the ship is in combat formation .
missiles are loaded .
staedert .
yes , sir .
i have a doubt .
i don' t , mr. president .
what happened ?
can you hear me ?
what happened ?
did you destroy it ?
i' m about to .
the planet has increased diameter by 200 % .
it' s moving toward the ship .
what do we have that' s bigger than 240 ?
nothing , sir .
staedert , do you hear me ?
get out of there .
i don' t want an incident .
do you hear me ?
get out of there .
can you hear me , staedert ?
do you understand ?
listen .
that' s an order .
do you understand me ?
do you hear me ?
get out of there !
good god !
four a day .
i' m tryin ' .
to quit is my goal .
i' m up .
all right , i' m up .
god .
hey , dog brain , finger here .
hi , sweetie .

i was talking to the cat .
i forgot ... you prefer your cat to the real thing .
at least the cat comes back .
still pining for that two timing slut ?
there' s millions out there .
i don' t want a million .
i just want one .
the perfect one .

negative .

it' il rot your brain .
for a perfect world .
give me the cash .

long enough .
give me the cash .
is that a z 140 ?
alleviated titanium .
neurocharged assault model .
good thing for me it' s not loaded .
it' s not loaded ?
you have to ... push that yellow button to load it .
take your time .
want me to
there you go .
give me the cash !
that' s a very dangerous gun .
maybe you better let me hang on to this one for you .
you don' t mind , do you ?
you sure ?
no .
take it .
i don' t need it .
that' s a nice hat .
you like it ?
god !
please enter your license .
yes , just a minute .
welcome , mr. dallas .
good morning .
sleep well ?
me too .
i had a horrible nightmare .
propulsion 2 x 4 .
you have five points left on your license .
yeah , thank you for reminding me .
have a nice day .
why not ?
you have 48 hours .
that' s the time it needs to adapt itself to our living conditions .
and then ?
then it will be too late .
the goal of this thing is not to fight over money or power ... but to exterminate life .
all forms of life .
you' re telling me there' s nothing that can stop this .
there is only one thing .
the mondoshawan have in their possession the weapon to defeat evil .
four elements ... gathered around a fifth ... supreme being , the ultimate warrior ... created to protect life .
together they produce " the light of creation .
able to bring life to the farthest reaches of the universe .
but , if ... evil stands there ...
then what ?
then light turns to dark .
life to death ... forever .
a mondoshawan spaceship requests permission to enter our territory .
give it permission to enter with our warmest regards .
thank you .
permission to enter granted .
show time .
we are lost .
aknot , we are connected to earth .
mr. zorg' s office .
it' s aknot .
i' m so glad to hear you , aknot .
the mission is accomplished .
you' il have what you asked for in a few hours .
good .
i' il meet you at my factory .
the attack was by two unregistered warships .
close all borders and declare a state of general alert .
try to contact the mondoshawans .
we owe them an explanation .
three hundred years of waiting for nothing .
go get some rest .
no .
the mondoshawan ...
i am their contact .
they will come for me .
this is government business .
i' il keep you informed .
the rescue team has reported from the crash site .
any survivors ?
only one .
you call that a survivor ?
a few cells still alive .
more than i need .
have you identified it ?
the computer went off the charts .
normal human beings have 40 dna memo groups ... which is enough for any species to perpetuate .
this has 200, 000 memo groups .
sounds like a freak of nature .
yeah , can' t wait to meet him .
you okay ?
over here .
excuse me .
general , i want to show you something .
this is a normal human dna chain .
you , me , anybody , right ?
watch this .
the compositional elements of his dna chain are like ours .
there' s simply more of them , with infinite genetic knowledge .
almost like this being was engineered .
is there any danger ?
we put it through the cellular hygiene detector .
the cell is , for lack of a better word ... perfect .
go ahead .
mr. perfect better be polite .
otherwise , i turn him into cat food .
activate it .
tissue processing .
ten seconds to ultraviolet protection .
this is the last phase .
the cells are bombarded by atoms which forces the body to react .
that means growing skin .
wonderful .
reconstruction complete .
remove the shield .
i told you .
perfect .
thermal bandages .
i' d ...
like to take a few pictures ... for the archives .
what' s she saying ?
i don' t know .
activate the phonic detector .
is that thing solid ?
unbreakable .
good .
if you want out ... you' il have to develop those communication skills .
general alert .
perfect .
ladder on 18 .

thank you so much .
and i' m definitely too thirsty .

if they don' t chase you after a mile , they don' t chase you .
maybe two miles .
hang on .

we' re safe for a while .
you want to play soft ?
i' il play soft .
you want to play hard ?

fifth ... element .
finger' s going to kill me .
hey !

i brought the girl , remember ?
the redhead .
she just dropped in on me .
started speaking a bizarre language .
it' s not bizarre .
it' s the divine language .
it' s the ancient language ... spoken throughout the universe before time was time .
he' s a she .
you noticed that .
yes .
it' s a miracle .
miracle she' s not dead .
not a moment to lose .
wake her up .
but gently , because this woman is ... mankind' s most precious possession .
she is perfect .
perfect .
more dignified .
hey , lady ... wake up .

korben dallas .
thank you for your help .
you' ve been kind , but now the girl needs to rest .
she' s been on a long trip .
i know .
i was there when she landed .
wait , wait , father .
she said something i didn' t understand .
what does " ekto gamat " mean ?
never without my permission .
that' s what i thought .
i shouldn' t have kissed her .
oh , no .
i' m so sorry .
i forgot your food .
how about some nice thai food ?
yeah , yeah , hold on .
buddy , i' m waiting all day here .
finger .
where' s the cab ?
car' s running fine .
fine .
what " fine " ?
i know you .
fine " ain' t in your vocabulary .
you can tell your old buddy finger what happened .
what ?
you save the planet ?
you dinged the fender again .
that' s it , right ?
i was on my way to see you , and a fare fell in my lap .
one of these big fares you can' t resist .
how big ?
five nine ... blue eyes ...
long legs , great skin .
you know ?
perfect .
i see .
and this perfect fare , she got a name ?
leeloo .
what' s she doing ?
learning our history , the last 5, 000 years that she missed .
she' s been asleep for a while .
i know she' s been through a lot , but we don' t have much time .
you' re right .
chicken .
good .
chicken .
i' m really sorry to interrupt you , but ... the case ... with the stones ... where is it ?
stolen ?
who in god' s name would do such a thing ?
excuse me , sir .
the council is worried about the economy heating up .
is it possible to fire 500, 000 ?
i thought from a smaller company , like one of the cab companies .
fire one million .
but 500, 000
one million .
fine , sir .
sorry to have disturbed you .
it' s for the supreme ...
sorry .
i didn' t know your size , and i found you this makeup box .
you just put it like that .
yes , there was a man with a limp ... came here a month ago asking about the stones .
said he was an art dealer .
what was his name ?
i' m bad with names .
they really make her  perfect , i know .
what' d she say ?
she says she knows exactly where they are .
my dear aknot , how about those two planes you borrowed ?
aknot , is that you ?
what an ugly face .
it doesn' t suit you .
take it off .
that' s better .
never be ashamed of who you are .
you' re warriors .
be proud .
so what if the federal government scattered you to the wind .
what doesn' t kill you makes you stronger .
your time for revenge is at hand .
the zf 1 .
it' s light .
the handle' s adjustable for easy carrying .
breaks down into four parts , undetectable by x ray .
discreet .
titanium recharger , 3, 000 round clip , with bursts of 3 to 300 .
with the replay button , a zorg invention , it' s even easier .
one shot ... and replay sends every following shot to the same location .
and to finish the job , all the zorg oldies but goldies .
rocket launcher .
arrow launcher ... with exploding or poisonous heads .
very practical .
net launcher .
the flamethrower .
my favorite .
and for the grand finale ... the new ice cube system .
four full crates ... delivered right on time .
and what about you , dear aknot ?
did you bring what i asked ?
yes .
magnificent .
this
this case is empty .
empty ?
empty ... the opposite of full .
this case is supposed to be full !
anyone care to explain ?
the guardians gave the stones to someone they could trust .
who took another route .
she' s supposed to contact this person ... in a hotel .
and she' s looking for the address .
easy .
dot .
it' s planet fhloston , in the angel constellation .
we' re saved .
i' m screwed .
you asked for a case .
we brought one .
a case with four stones in it !
not one or two or three , but four !
four stones !
but what the hell am i supposed to do with an empty case ?
we are warriors , not merchants .
but you can still count !
look at my fingers .
four stones , four crates .
zero stones , zero crates !
pack everything up !
we' re out of here !
we risked our lives .
i believe a little compensation is in order .
so you are merchants after all .
leave him one crate for the cause .
i don' t like warriors .
narrow minded , no subtlety ... and they fight for hopeless causes , honor .
honor' s killed millions of people .
hasn' t saved a single one .
i' il tell you what i do like : a killer .
a dyed in the wool killer , cold blooded , clean and methodical .
a real killer picking up the zf 1 ... would' ve asked about the red button on the bottom of the gun .
bring me the priest .
i got everything we need to know about fhloston paradise ... and a blueprint of the hotel .
good work , my son .
now to find a way there .
it won' t be easy .
there' s a charity ball tomorrow .
flights are full , and the hotel will be guarded .
there must be a way .
i' il get it .
weddings ?
not really .
mr. zorg would like to talk to you .
who ?
mr. zorg .
jean baptiste ...
emmanuel ...
zorg .
it' s nice to see you again , father .
i remember you now .
the so called art dealer .
i' m glad you got your memory back .
because you' il need it .
where are the stones ?
i don' t know .
if i did , i wouldn' t tell someone like you .
why ?
what' s wrong with me ?
i try to serve life .
but you only ... want to destroy it .
father ... you' re so wrong .
let me explain .
life , which you so nobly serve , comes from destruction and chaos .
take this empty glass .
here it is , peaceful ... boring .
but if it is ... destroyed .
look at all these little things .
so busy now .
notice how each is useful .
what a lovely ballet ensues ... so full of form and color .
now think of all those people that created them .
technicians , engineers .
people who can feed their children tonight ... so those children can grow up and have children ... and so on .
thus adding to the great chain ... of life .
water .
fruit .
you see , father , by creating a little destruction ...
i' m encouraging life .
in reality , you and i are in the same business .
cheers .
where' s the robot to pat you on the back ?
or the engineer ?
or their children , maybe ?
there , you see how all your so called power counts for nothing ?
how your entire empire of destruction comes ... crashing down ... all because of one , little ... cherry .
you saved my life ... and in return , i' il spare yours ... for now .
you' re a monster , zorg .
i know .
torture who you have to , the president , i don' t care .
just bring me the stones .
you have one hour .
it' s gobbling up all the satellites in the galaxy .
why is it eating up all the satellites ?
we' re working on it .
the mondoshawan deplore the incident but accept our apologies .
and the stones ?
did you find them ?
they weren' t on board .
what ?
the mondoshawan never fully trusted the human race .
they gave them to someone they do trust .
her name is plavalaguna .
she' s a diva .
she' s singing at a charity ball in fhloston paradise .
she has the stones .
the mondoshawans will help .
we must send someone ... to get the stones .
excellent .
i want this operation to be as discreet as possible .
no troops .
no big operation .
i want your best man to go undercover .
i have the perfect one .
you' ve got a message .
not opening it ?
could be important .
like the last two were important .
first one was from my wife telling me she' s leaving .
the second was from my lawyer telling me he was leaving with my wife .
that is bad luck .
grandfather say ...
it never rain everyday .
this is good news , guaranteed .
i bet you lunch .
okay .
come on .
you are fired .
oh , i' m sorry .
at least i won lunch .
good philosophy .

i like .
hello .
korben , sweetheart .
you got broken fingers ?
you can' t punch my number ?
hi , mom .
seventeen messages .
don' t say your machine is broken again .
they last 1, 000 years .
mr. kim , you should go .
this' il take a minute .
you don' t feed your cat a croquette , who you love more than me .
she didn' t breast feed you .
i did .
good fortune for you .
you don' t have a girl .
i' il never be a grandmother .
it bring you good luck !
my body' s failing .
take me on this trip .
what are you talking about ?
you want to make me beg ?
no , all i want is an explanation .
i just got in .
i just smashed my cab .
i lost my job .
i got mugged .
besides that , everything' s peachy .
thanks for asking .
now settle down and explain this to me .
you don' t know you won a trip ... to fhloston paradise for two for ten days ?
i suppose you' il just leave me on the lunar surface ?
if i' d won a trip , i' d know .
i would' ve been notified .
they' ve been blaring your name out on the radio for an hour .
i' il call you back .
general , how nice to see you in the 5000 block .

might be important .
you' re a winner !
you' ve won the gemini contest and a trip to fhloston paradise for two .

congratulations .
you couldn' t be more discreet ?
old tricks are the best tricks .
major iceborg will accompany you as your wife .
i am not going .
why not ?
excuse me , general .
who is it ?
who is it ?
my wife .
you remarried ?
yes ... no .
i just met this girl , but i' m going to marry her .
i love her , but she hates the military .
she knows the military ruined my last marriage .
she can' t have anything to do with it .
if she sees you , she' il kill me .
major  you gotta hide somewhere .
you' ve gotta help me .
we' d love to , but where can we hide ?
we don' t have time for this .
it' s just for one minute .

we' re on a mission .
what kind ?
we have to save the world , my son .
you' re gonna save the world ?

this is a police control .
this is not an exercise .
come on , get in .
for one minute , all right ?
just stay here for one minute .
this is a police control .
don' t touch anything .
this is not an exercise .
can you please spread your legs ... and place your hands in the yellow circles .
what are you doing ?
saving you so you can save the world .
yeah , but i
i think this is the door .
no name , no number .
let' s see it .
are you classified as human ?
negative .
i am a meat popsicle .
i found him .
mr. korben dallas ?
sir , can you put your hands in the yellow circles , please ?
smoke you !
wrong answer .
the police control is now terminated .
thank you for your cooperation .

end of transmission .
that' s the best show i ever did .
major dallas has the five elements on board ... and the priest is guiding them to the temple .
we' re saved .
the diva said i should take care of you .
humans act so strange .
what do you mean ?
everything you created ... is used to destroy .
we call it human nature .
you learn that on your screen ?
i' m not finished yet .
i' m up to " v.
v " is good .
some good words in " v.
like what ?
valiant .
vulnerable .
very beautiful .
oh , of course , munro !
mr. president ?
now what ?
we have a problem .
it' s advancing ?
it' s not only advancing , it' s moving at incredible speed .
and do you have any idea where it' s heading ?
korben , there' s a general on the phone .
i' il give you the president .
major dallas , i first would like to salute a warrior .
you' re a shining example of this army .
in the name of the federation
any idea when you' il get to the point ?
a ball of fire 1, 200 miles in diameter heading straight for earth ... and we have no idea how to stop it .
that' s the problem .
how much time do we have ?
if its speed remains constant , in an hour and 57 minutes .
i' il call you back in two hours .
hello ?
they just landed in the desert .
good job , david .
put her in the center .
where ?
here ?
you got it figured out , father ?
this one should be fire .
you know how this works ?
theoretically .
the four stones should go around .
the fifth element should be in the middle ... and then the weapon against evil should work .
you' ve never seen this work ?
give me that .
every weapon has a manual .
i' m sure this has one too .
that' s it .
that' s it .
match up the symbols .
go !
go !
wind .
my man , what you doing ?
what ?
what you doing ?
trying to keep you in the d. j. business .

what happens ?
so , now , we have to open them .
and you know how to do that .
right ?
theoretically ...
no .
leeloo , honey , wake up .
you have to help us .
how do you open the stones ?
wind blows .
fire burns .
yes , i know all that .
but how do you open these stones ?
rain ...
falls .
what does it mean ?
i think that
maybe it' s a charade .
a game or something .
if we don' t get these stones open in five minutes , we' re dead .
dead ?
yes , dead .
too late .
we' ve lost contact with them .
three minutes .
i think mine is broken .
why i gotta get the broke one ?
we' re never gonna make it .
it moved .
show me what you did .
nothing .
shut up , shut up !
show me what you did , step by step .
i was standing here .
quickly .
i put my hands on the top like this , and i said ...
we' re not going to make it .
and that' s it ?
korben , my man .
wind .
she said , " wind blows .
everyone take a stone .
water for water .
fire for fire .
earth for earth .
go !
earth .
open the other one .
korben , my man , i have no fire .
i have no matches .
do you have any ?
i stopped smoking .
father , you smoke ?

we need some fire .
we' re going to die .
don' t breathe .
fire .
one minute .
let' s go , leeloo .
wake up .
wake up .
it' s time for you to work now .
protect life ... until death .
listen to me !
listen to me .
listen , i know you' re very tired .
i' il take you on vacation .
a real vacation , just you and me .
but if you don' t do something right now ... we' il all die .
what' s the use of saving life when you see what you do with it ?
it' il enter the atmosphere in 40 seconds .
you' re right .
you' re right .
there are some things ... very nice things worth saving ; beautiful things .
beautiful things .
like love ?
yes , love .
that' s good .
that' s good .
that' s a good example .
love is worth saving .
i don' t know love .
i don' t know love .
i was built to protect , not love .
so there' s no use for me other than this .
you' re wrong .
you' re wrong .
you' re wrong .
i need you .
i need you , very much .
why ?
because ... because ...
tell her , korben .
tell me .
please .
why you need me ?
because ...
tell me .
tell me .
because i
because i love you .
i love you .
10 ... 9 ... 8 ... 7 ... 6 , 5 ... 4 , 3 ... 2 ... 1 .

give it here .
mrs. dallas , this is the president .
on behalf of the federation
that doesn' t even sound like him .
the president' s an idiot .
you don' t sound like an idiot .
if you don' t want to talk to your mother ... just avoid me as usual .
i' il throw myself in traffic .
i' il saran wrap myself to the bed .
