what you say , it was funny .
kostya , you can' t ... when you ...
it' s an expression .
if you say that ...
it' s a , uh , euphemism , right ?
can you explain this ?
you' re the english teacher .
uh ...
i think what he means , kostya , is that when you say ,
funny you should say that , " that means that it reminds you of a funny story .
exactly .
no , no .
it was funny what you say ...
funny you should say that .
it still makes no fucking sense .
this is what i deal with .

i' ve told you this , right ?
she' s the only girl i' ve ever kept fantasizing about after i slept with her .

that' s a pretty good kind of normal .
hey , fellas .
tomorrow , huh ?
that' s right .
nothing but a catnap .
stay cool , brother .
fuck .
fuck .
how you doing , brother ?
you all right ?
six months , you know .
come on , now .
six months before i got pinched ,
i was gonna come to you with the loot ... put me in some stocks , put me in some mutuals .
don' t do this .
i' m gonna kick back , watch my coin multiply .
we' re gonna get rich together .
you know , monty , you shouldn' t talk like this .
i just thought , " no , you know ,
i can take out a little more to live on , a little more .
i got greedy , greedy .
i just fucked myself .
man , you' re gonna wrap yourself around in a twist , you keep thinking about this shit .
that' s all i can do is think about it .
i' m not gonna make it , frank .
yes , you will .
there' s a thousand guys up there who are harder than me .
i mean , in a room , some junkie doesn' t want to pay me , and kostya behind me , i' m pretty scary .
up there , i' m a skinny white boy with no friends .
those guys are gonna use me up and end me .
no , they won' t , man .
you know why ?
because you' re smarter than all of them .
you' re gonna get up there , you' re gonna keep your eyes open and your mouth shut .
you' re gonna know the names , the whole scenario .
you' re gonna have the place wired in a week .
the place is overcrowded .
they got bunk beds lined up in the gymnasium to handle the overflow .
i' m going in a room with 200 other guys , frank .
so picture this ... first night , lights out .
guards are moving out of the space ,
iooking back over their shoulders , laughing at me ,
you are miles from home .
door closes , boom ...
i' m on the floor ,
i got some big guy' s knee in my back .
i can give it a little go , but there will be too many of them .
someone takes a pipe out from under a mattress , starts beating me in the face ... not to hurt me , just to knock all my teeth out so i can give him head all night , and they don' t have to worry about me biting .
let' s say i make it through 7 years minus 84 days for good behavior .
w what then ?
what kind of skills do i have ?
i can' t get a job in the straight world .
i can' t go back to doing this .
it' s 15 years to life for a second pinch .
i mean , i ...
i' m gonna be a 38 year old punked out ex con with government issue dentures .
38 is still young .
you' re gonna get out , and you and me , we' re gonna start something up ... you know , a fucking bar .
we' re two irish kids from brooklyn .
where the fuck would we be without a bar , right ?
how can we not have a bar ?
come on , we have free hot dogs on " monday night football , " you know ?
we got an old jukebox in the corner .
green beer on st. patty' s day .
fuck green beer , frank .
you' ve been working 15 years to get away from green beer .
god , i hate this shit , too .
i' m just saying we got options .
i appreciate the thought .
i don' t see it , man .
seven years , you' re gonna be running your own show .
i don' t see you working with me .
we' ve known each other since we were 3 .
have i ever broken a promise to you , huh ?
have i ever once broken a promise to you ?
have i ever said i' m gonna be somewhere and not shown up ?
no .
i' m gonna be there when you get out , you hear me ?
i' m gonna fucking be there .
i know you will , i know you will , but you' re not gonna be there tomorrow , and it' s all about tomorrow .
listen , i got one idea , one way i might buy myself a little room to breathe , but i need a big favor from you .

how do you want him to act ?
i want him to act like he' s scared .
well , he is scared , naturelle .
believe me , he' s scared .
i just don' t want him to hurt himself .
so will you watch him for me ?
i don' t think he wants me here .
why ?
why wouldn' t he want you here ?
you see the way he looks at me lately ?
it' s like he doesn' t trust me .
what reason does he have not to trust you ?
i' m gonna go up top , francis .
so when you see him , just ...
cool .
i got it .
hey .
are you all right ?
how could he do this , huh ?
just throw it all away ?
i' m his oldest friend .
what' d i do to stop it ?
what' d i say to him ?
nothing .
not a word .
when he started selling weed to the kids at coventry ,
i didn' t say shit .
everybody' s talking about buying from monty , you know , the whole school , and i knew they were gonna nail him , i knew it .
i didn' t say a word .
fucking last 10 years , i' ve been watching him get deeper and deeper in with these friends of his , these fucks who you wouldn' t want petting doyle .
and did i say , " hey , careful , monty , you better cool out , man " ?
i didn' t say shit .
i just sat there and watched him ruin his life .
and you did , too , all right ?
we both did .
we all did .
monty never listens .
uh huh .
you know how stubborn he is , okay ?
i told monty he should quit a hundred times .
did you ?
was that before or after you moved into his apartment ?
of all nights , please not tonight .
just don' t start .
who paid for the apartment ?
i need a drink .
j. d. , shot .
was that before or after he gave you that platinum necklace ?
do you want to watch your mouth ?
who paid for the cartier diamond earrings ... this silver dress you' re wearing ?
paid in full by the addictions of other people .
back up .
that' s what i' m saying .
you two fly down to san juan , first class all the way .
what do you think paid for puerto rico ?
you' ve never been to p ...
listen to me .
you' ve never been to p. r. in your life before monty .
you told him to quit ?
the hell you did , naturelle .
back up .
you knew the deal the minute you met him .
come on .
you never had a real job in your whole life .
you' ve been living off the fat of the land .
and you never said a goddamn word .
who are you to get all righteous with me ?
huh ?
did you disown him ?
you' re his best friend , and you never said a thing .
but this is my fault ?
i' m the evil one ?
i never took his money .
never once , not a red ...
how long have you been saving this , huh ?
i came over here to talk to my friend francis .
one minute ago , you were my friend .
are you drunk ?
tell me you' ve been drinking too much .
you' re fucking drunk .
i' m irish .
i can' t get drunk , all right ?
i know exactly what i' m saying .
seven years from now , i' il be at the prison gate .
you' il be married to monty .
right or wrong ?
right or wrong ?
what is wrong with you ?
you want me to be the bad guy ?
fine , i' m the bad guy .
are you happy now ?
god , francis .
all i' m saying ... is you knew where he hid the money .
you knew where he hid the drugs , didn' t you ?
what the hell are you saying ?
what the hell are you saying right now , francis ?
you know exactly what i' m saying .
i told monty when he first met you , but he wouldn' t listen to me .
i told him , " naturelle riviera ... she ain' t nothin ' but a spic skank skeezer .
nat .
i' ve been looking all over for you .
another one ?
here you go .
is she all right ?
can we get out of here ?
nope .
we gotta wait for monty .
i kissed her .

who you trying to be ...
r. kelly ?
i kissed my 17 year old high school student .
jake ... have a drink .
shut the fuck up .
excuse me .
could i ... could i have a water ?
fuck that .
hit him .
hit him .
okay .
i don' t want to drink anymore , frank .
give him the whiskey .
shut up .
drink it .
montgomery , how' s the party ?
nice .
thanks for setting it up .
the first time i went to prison ...
i was 14 years old .
skinny little boy ... very afraid .
by the time i came out , i had a beard .
i was grown man .
i went back to my hometown .
i found my mother .
i kissed her .
and she screamed .
she didn' t recognize me .
i have been in three different prisons , montgomery .
three different countries .
and you know what i learned ?
i learned prison is a bad place to be .
seven years is a long time .
some men would do anything to avoid seven years in prison .
your father is a hardworking man .
where' s his bar ?
staten island ?
2192 bay street ?
he drives in from bay ridge ... a 1986 jeep grand wagoneer .
should i tell you how many miles he has on the car ?
your father ...
i like your father ... a hardworking man .
he' s had bad luck .
everyone in the neighborhood loved your mother .
da ?
yeah .
everyone said she was a beautiful woman .
i want to help your father .
i could use a man like that , a hardworking man , a man i could trust .
i could take care of your father .
do you understand what i mean , montgomery ?
you don' t have to do this .
you don' t ...
i never said anything to anybody , okay ?
leave my father out of it .
i asked you a question , montgomery .
yeah .
i understand exactly what you mean .
i have a good job for your father .
we' il help him with the money he owes .
no , thank you .
good weapon .
accurate .
and reliable .
no jams .
have you ever fired a gun ?
at someone , i mean .
no .
it' s a toy for you .
not toy , a prop .
a prop for you , like an actor .
am i wrong ?
with the gun , you feel more ... dangerous .
i wouldn' t know .
it' s not mine .
i didn' t say anything .
i never said anything , nikolai .
i swear to god .
they came after me to get to you .
i know that .
you know that .
they tried .
i never said anything .
i believe you , montgomery .
this is my advice to you ... when you get there , figure it out who' s who .
find the man nobody' s protecting ... a man without friends ... and beat him until his eyes bleed .
let them think you are a little bit crazy , but respectful , too .
respectful of the right men .
you are a good looking boy .
it won' t be easy for you .
but remember , i was 14 when i first went .
i tattooed " survive " on my hand the night before i went away to prison .

cool dog .
cool dog .
give me the word , and i' il take a left turn .
left turn to where ?
take the gw bridge and go west .
get you stitched up somewhere and keep going .
find a nice little town .
on the way , stop in chicago for a cubs game .
you always told me you wanted to see wrigley field .
dad ...
i' m saying that if you want it ... if that' s what you want , i' il do it .
no , they' d take your bar .
my bar .
jesus .
my bar .
they can take my bar to hell and back .
you think my bar is more important to me than you , my only child ?
give me the word , and we' il go .
they' il find me .
they' il find me sooner or later .
you know how they find people ?
they find them when they come home .
people run away , but they usually come back .
that' s when they get caught .
so you go ... and you never come back .
you never come home .
we' il drive .
we' il keep driving .
head out to the middle of nowhere .
take that road as far as it takes us .
you' ve never been west of philly , have you ?
this is a beautiful country , monty .
it' s beautiful out there .
looks like a different world ... mountains , hills , cows , farms , and white churches .
i drove out west with your mother one time before you was born .
brooklyn to the pacific in three days .
just enough money for gas , sandwiches , and coffee , but we made it .
every man , woman , and child alive should see the desert one time before they die .
nothing at all for miles around , nothing but sand and rocks and cactus and blue sky .
not a soul in sight .
no sirens , no car alarms , nobody honking at you , no madman cursing or pissing on the streets .
you find the silence out there .
you find the peace .
you can find god .
* ye' il take the high road and i' il take the low road *
* and i' il be in scotland afore ye *
* but me and my true love will never meet again *
* on the bonnie , bonnie banks of loch lomond *
so , we drive west .
keep driving till we find a nice little town .
these towns out in the desert ... you know why they got there ?
people wanted to get away from somewhere else .
the desert' s for starting over .
find a bar , and i' il buy us drinks .
two .
i haven' t had a drink in two years , but i' il have one with you .
one last whiskey with my boy .
take our time with it ... taste the barley , let it linger .
and then i' il go .
i want you to keep that .
i' il hold it for you .
i' il tell you , " don' t ever write me .
don' t ever come visit .
i' il tell you , " i believe in god' s kingdom ,
and i believe i' il be with you again and your mother , but not in this lifetime .
you get a job somewhere ... a job that pays cash , a boss who doesn' t ask questions .
and you make a new life and you never come back .
monty , people like you .
it' s a gift .
you make friends wherever you go .
how you fellas doin ' ?
two beers .
you' re gonna work hard .
you' re gonna keep your head down and your mouth shut .
you' re gonna make yourself a new home out there .
here you go , james .
thanks a lot .
you' re a new yorker .
that will never change .
you got new york in your bones .
spend the rest of your life out west , but you' re still a new yorker .
you' il miss your friends , you' il miss your dog , but you' re strong .
you got your mother' s backbone in you .
you' re strong like she was .
hey .
you find the right people , and you get yourself papers .
why don' t you go ahead and have a seat ?
a driver' s license .
what' s your name ?
uh , james .
james .
not from around here , are you ?
no , i' m from out west .
well , let' s go ahead and get your picture .
be still .
give me a smile .
okay .
why don' t you give me a bigger smile , james ?
come on , big , bigger .
okay .
you forget your old life .
you can' t come back .
you can' t call .
you can' t write .
you never look back .
you make a new life for yourself , and you live it .
you hear me ?
you live your life the way it should have been .
and maybe ...
this is dangerous , but maybe after a couple of years , you send word to naturelle .
mmm .
oh .
4 ...
3 ... 2 ... 1 .
happy new year .
happy new year .
mmm .
feel that right there .
your mother' s a lunatic .
hurry up .
i need company .
you get yourself a new family , and you raise them right , you hear me ?
give them a good life , monty .
give them what they need .
you have a son .
maybe you name him james .
it' s a good , strong name .
and maybe one day , years from now ,
long after i' m dead and gone , reunited with your dear mother , you gather your whole family together and tell them the truth , who you are and where you come from .
we were in new york together .
you tell them the whole story .
i was arrested .
and then you ask them if they know how lucky they are to be there .
all of you ...
it all came so close to never happening . ... came so close to never happening .
this life came so close to never happening .
