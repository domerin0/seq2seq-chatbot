sand is overrated .

ifonly i could meet someone new .
i guess my chances ofthat happening are somewhat diminished , seeing that i' m incapable ofmaking eye contact with a woman i don' t know .
maybe i should get back together with naomi .
she was nice .
nice is good .
she loved me .
why do i fall in love with every woman i see ... who shows me the least bit ofattention ?

now , the , uh the first thing we need you to do , mr. barish , is to go home ... andcollect evertyhingyou own that has some association with clementine .
anything .
and we' il use these items to create a map ofclementine in your brain .
okay ?
so we' il need , uh , uh , photos , clothing , gifts , books she may have boughtyou , cds you may have bought together , journal entries .
we want to emptyyour home
we want to emptyyour life ofclementine .
and after the mapping is done , our technicians will do the erasing in your home tonight .
that way , when you awake in the morning , you' il findyourselfin your own bed as ifnothing had happened a new life awaitingyou .

february is very busy for us because ofvalentine' s day .
** [ dixielandjazz ]
this is , uh , stan fink , one ofourmost experienced andskilled technicians .
** [ continues ]
he' il be handling your case tonight .
great to meetyou , mr. barish .
my name is joel barish , and i' m here to erase clementine kruczynski .
very good .
now , tell me about , uh , clementine .
uh , i was ...
iiving with this woman , naomi , uh , a coupleyears ago , and my friends rob and carrie invited us to this party at the beach i don' t like parties .
naomi couldn' t go , but i went ... and i , uh , met clementine .
i' m sorry .
let' s start with your most recent memories ... and work backwards from there , more or less .
there' s an emotional core ... to each of our memories , and when you eradicate that core it starts its degradation process .
bythe timeyou wake up in the morning , all the memories we' ve targeted will havewithered and disappeared , as in a dream upon waking .
is there any risk ofbrain damage ?
well , uh , technically speaking , the procedure is brain damage , but it' s on a parwith a night ofheavy drinking .
nothing you' il miss .
comfortable ?
whatwe' re doing here , mr. barish , is actually creating a map ofyour brain .
okay , let' s getstarted .
ifwe want to get thisprocedure underwaytonight , we have some work to do .
i want you to react to these objects , mr. barish , ifyou will .
there' s a good story behind this one
uh , actually , mr. barish , i' il get a much better emotional readout ... ifyou refrain from any sort of verbal description ofthe items .
just tryto focus on the memories .
oh .
sorry .
okay .
healthyactivityup there again .
healthyreadouts .
verygood .
here' s another object .
that' s so
next item .
okay .
potato head .
next item .
okay .
just focus on the memories .
patrick , do me a favor .
hey , patrick , do me a favor , willya ?
yeah .
can you check the voltage regulator ?
what do we got there ?
u h , voltage looks fine .
really ?
well , i' m not wiping as clean as i like here .
i' m [ scoffs ]
well , uh , technicallythe procedure is brain damage .
check the , uh check the connections , please .
oh , there you are .
i
why am i i don' t understand what i' m looking at .
why am i standing here and
oh , my god .
deja vu .
deja vu .
this is so
all right , we should get started .
ifwe' re gonna get the procedure ... [ simultaneously ]
underwaytonight , we have somework to do .
i' m in my head already , aren' t i ?
i suppose so .
uh , this is about right .

this is weird .
toallpatients ofdr .
howardmierzwiak .
myname is marysvevo .
we' ve met , butyou don' t remember me .
i worked for a companyyou hired to have part ofyour memory erased .
ihavesince decided that this is a horrible some kind ofteaser ad or something .
in orderto correct this , i' m sending everyone' s file back to them .
myname is clementine kruczynski .
i' m here to erasejoel barish .
what is this ?
i don' t know .
he' s boring .
is that enough reason to erase someone ?
i' ve been thinking lately how i was before and how i am now , and it' s like he changed me .
i feel like i' m always pissy now .
i don' t like myselfwhen i' m with him .
i don' t like myselfanymore .
i can' t stand to even look at him .
that pathetic , wimpy , apologetic smile .
that sort ofwounded puppyshit he does , you know ?
what are you doing ?
i ' m not doing anything .
the bloom is certainly fucking offthe rose at this point .
are you screwing with me ?
no !
you are screwing with me .
joel , i' m not !
you clearly are .
look , let' s just take a minute and
patrick , get the fuckaway .
oh , sweetheart get the fuck away from me !
can we talk about it ?
no !
get the fuck away !
joel barish .
hey , clementine .
hey .
nice to seeyou .
yeah .
yeah .
reallyveryeducated .
i mean , she' s smart , i think , but not educated .
i couldn' t reallytalk to her about books, you know ?
she' s more of a magazine reading girl .
hervocabularyleaves something to be desired .
sometimes i was embarrassed in public ...
hi . because she wouldpronounce ...
iibrary " libary . " hi .
libary .
libary .
look what i found .
i think ifthere' s a trulyseductive quality about clementine , it' s that herpersonalitypromises to take you out ofthe mundane .
you made me look skinny .
amazing , burning meteorite ... will carryyou to another world where things are exciting .
but whatyou quickly learn is that ... it' s really an elaborate ruse .
i ' m sorry i yelled at you .
it' s okay .
so flashy in a kind ofobvious way .
but still , it seduces you .
joel , i really like you .
i hate that i said mean things aboutyou .
let me turn this off , okay ?
hey , it' s it' s onlyfair .
where' s the real clementine ?
i mean , the whole thing with the hair it' s all bullshit .
i really like your hair .
thankyou .
i reallylikeyourhair .
thankyou .
i do .
the world' s a goddamn mess .
is it some kind ofa revolt ?
changeyourhair color .
you want a drink or something ?
do you have anywhiskey ?
no , i don' t think hersex is ... motivated .
i sawit clearly the last night we were together .
it wasn' t sex .
it wasjust sad .
hey .
sorry .
i thought there was more .
the only way clem thinks she can get people to like her ... is to fuck ' em ... or at least dangle the possibility ofgetting fucked in front of' em .
and she' s so desperate and insecure ... that she' il , sooner or later , go around fucking everybody .
i don' t do that .
i wouldn' t think that aboutyou .
because i don' t .
i know .
because it reallyhurts me thatyou said that because i don' t do that .
i' m so sorry .
i' m sorry about all this .
i' m gonna ... go .
i' m a little confused .
i don' t really think i can be here .
um ... bye .
bye .
i thought i knewherso well .
itwas nice meeting you and all .
but i don' t knowherat all .
what a loss tospend that much time with someone , onlyto findout thatshe' s a stranger .
wait .
what ?
i don' t know .
just wait . just wait .
what doyou want, joel ?
i don' t know .
i want you to wait for ... just a while .
okay .
really ?
i' m not a concept, joel .
i' mjust a fucked up girl who' s looking formy own peace ofmind .
i' m not perfect .
i can' t see anything that i don' t like about you .
right now i can' t .
but you will .
butyou will .
you know , you will thinkofthings , and i' il get bored with you and feel trapped ... because that' s what happens with me .
okay .
okay .
okay .
okay .
