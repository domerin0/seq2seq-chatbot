oops , the silent type .
an introvert .

he could have told us a lot , freddy .
you know me , vincke .
no risks .
we should have busted him sooner .
we had enough .
i was hoping for more .
do you think i was the first one he asked to come up ?
look at it from the bright side .
one less fatso , and the girl has been saved .
vincke ?
eric ?
in belgium ?
there are potential customers there , angelo .
it would be an important market .
not for me .
fries , please .
right away .
but you just ordered some .
what' s wrong with you ?
gilles , you' d better send somebody else .
i' m tired .
don' t start whining about retirement again .
angelo , people like us don' t retire .
i hate belgium .
as does everybody .
but you know the place .
that' s important .
don' t you have a brother there ?
you could pay him a visit .
if he' s still alive .
visit his grave then .
most foreigners only know bruges in belgium .
they talk about bruges , bruges ...
but antwerp is much prettier , right ?
there is more to see here than in bruges .
bruges is a lot smaller too .
it doesn' t amount to much .
most people don' t know ...
here you go , mr. ledda .
you have room 633 .
is this your first time in our hotel ?
i speak dutch .
a bad habit .
i' ve got more of those .
and ?
alone ?
not anymore .
are you mr ...
casoni .
did you have a good trip ?
i' ve got the files you asked for .
it' s all there .
excuse me ...
yes , hello ?
yes , i' m working hard on it .
no , he doesn' t say much .
and he looks like his head has been under a tram for two years .
but they must know what they' re doing , no ?
yes .
my customer wants to know when .
if everything has been planned well , it' il go fast .
fast is too slow .
we want to know when .
first , i' m going to lay with my head under a tram for a year or two .
are you coming to the opening of the exhibition or not ?
no time , honey .
building permits .
and a meeting in brussels .
but have fun .
after all , that' s what you married me for .
a long time ago , yes .
what' s that supposed to mean ?
nothing , bob , nothing .
see you later .
if it gets too late , i' il have to spend the night in brussels .
ok .
but do me a favour .
buy her a better perfume .
typical !
your keys , i bet .
how often did i ...
are you smart ?
are you smart , i asked .
if you' re smart , you know who sent me .
are you smart ?
if you' re smart , you' il also know why i' m here .
do you know ?
where is it ?
downstairs ?
where is it ?
where is it ?
you don' t know who i am , do you ?
if that cretin really thinks ...
if i give it to you , will you let me go ?
please ...
i swear i won' t talk .
daddy ?
daddy , i' m going to katrien' s , ok ?
hello , who' s speaking ?
yes , it' s me .
no , problem number 1 is solved .
no , you don' t have to worry .
yes , see you soon .
yes , freddy .
how do you know it' s me ?
anybody in their right mind hangs up after 20 times .
what' s up ?
the big boss needs us .
it' s rather urgent .
you absolutely had to be there .
on one of my rare days off .
give me ten minutes , ok ?
never heard of mineral water ?
mineral water ?
in the morning ?
definitely not with an clair .
shit !
fucking bmw' s !
give way to the right .
pay some attention .
but it' s true . isn' t it ?
they push you right off the road , flashing their lights .
made in germany and who drive them ?
hair dressers and doorkeepers .
i' il tap their rear lights .
no , no .
i' il pee on their door handle .
yes .
it sticks and stinks like hell .
the insurance doesn' t pay .
when you' re rear light is broken ...
one phone call and it' s solved .
you' re on the wrong track .
you' re punishing the wrong one .
yeah , yeah .
the insurance , the wrong one ?
come on .
very urgent matter .
i' m curious .
good morning , chief .
freddy .
linda .
we don' t know much .
mr. van camp didn' t come home last night and didn' t show up at work .
that' s for missing people .
the national police have been there yet , but the lady is a good friend of the boss .
is van parys here ?
yes .
he wants us to investigate the case very discretely .
why ?
mr. van camp is quite a big shot .
director general of the planning department .
eva , chief vincke and inspector verstuyft .
nice to meet you .
mrs. van camp .
mrs. van camp is a good friend of my wife .
did linda brief you ?
yes , well she told me what she knows .
the car is still in the garage .
it hasn' t been used yet .
so ...
i' m afraid something happened .
did your husband have a reason to leave .
an argument maybe ?
it this the first time he' s gone overnight ?
verstuyft , let vincke do his job .
look at that car .
coemans knows the way .
my husband knows these addresses .
but his work comes first .
he' d never not show up .
does he have any problems ?
problems ?
all big construction files pass through his office ,
i can imagine he has friends , but also enemies .
can we stick to the facts ?
i' il try .
would you rather do the interrogation yourself ?
or are we going to let our friends of the national police do their job ?
van parys , damnit .
a political buddy falls asleep on top of his mistress and all antwerp has to act on it .
van parys wants to shag her .
can' t you see ?
i think she killed her man .
what shall we do ?
search the whole forest ?
drive , freddy .
wait .
don' t you have a brother there ?
you could go and see him .
paolo ?
it' s me , angelo .
sir ?
can i help you ?
are you related to mr. ledda ?
distantly .
has he been here for a long time ?
yes , yes .
very long .
it went fast .
it started ...
i know how it starts .
you' re right .
why do you need to know french for a chief' s exam ?
to be able to read the menus in the posh restaurants .
coemans , shut up !
and stop ogling at linda , pig !
say , hasn' t that file been handed to child welfare ?
i borrowed it for a while .
over achiever .
does van parys know about it ?
sometimes one has to go against the rules .
do we know anything about van camp yet ?
linda and coemans are working on it , but so far , no news .
i promised mrs. van camp that we' d have some news .
freddy , you know somebody from the national police .
try to find out something .
chief , we' re working on something else at the moment .
bieke cuypers , i guess ?
the file that you requested from child welfare , behind my back .
sorry , but that case is closed for us .
miss cuypers ?
brigitte ?
everybody calls me bieke .
are you a friend of daddy ?
are you a friend of daddy ?
she' s 12 , 13 at the most .
sorry , i' m not doing that .
you' re wrong .
she looks much younger than she is .
she can' t be older than 12 , 13 .
sorry , i won' t do that .
you already said that .
you' re stuck in a groove .
she' s still a child .
i won' t do it .
if you think you can do this to me , you' ve got another thing coming !
one phone call !
one phone call to marseille !
you don' t get it .
nobody will do it .
forget it .
we' il find somebody else .
no , you won' t !
no ?
give me one reason why not .
i' il give you three .
one !
two !
and three !
the treasure chest of your good friend bob van camp .
understood ?
crazy !
but ok !
did you hire a bunch of carnival singers ?
my customer wants to see you .
tomorrow .
here , same time .
don' t forget your box .
your wallet ...
mr. seynaeve .
van camp has just disappeared .
even his mistress doesn' t know anything .
they check the passenger lists at the airports .
he fled abroad .
is that what they think ?
is there any concrete information or is it occupational therapy ?
concrete information ?
occupational therapy ?
our intellectual legal friend from the judicial police . commissioner .
if you need information , we' re very happy to oblige .
but first send us an official piece of paper .
you' re good at that , aren' t you ?
sorry , commissioner .
we didn' t know you people could read .
i didn' t know you had to learn to shoot .
and since you have to learn to shoot , mr. verstuyft , why don' t you have your own shooting range ?
unfortunately , we don' t have the same budgets as the national police .
no .
it' s because 90 % of your budget is spent on paper .
if i used too much paper , you can come and get some from us .
it' il be the night of your life .
yeah , yeah , i bet .
a night like you have never had before in your entire career .
some other time , ok ?
come on .
look here .
room 105 .
perfect for a hot woman .
excuse me , you' re bothering the lady , the other guests , and me .
and who are you ?
her pimp , maybe ?
tell me how much this hot truffle is going to cost me .
you' re looking for something hot , right ?
a gentleman ?
no .
a customer .
relax , relax .
you were dreaming .
don' t you know me anymore ?
stay .
sorry .
stay .
i can hear your blood flow .
that' s my head that' s leaking .
you' re a character .
can you tell ?
i know .
i fancy strange men .
two bullets in the chest , one in the head .
professional job .
bastards .
bastards !
bastards !
and the other wounds ?
from the ship propeller .
she must have been mangled by it .
freddy , make sure you' il become chief as soon as you can .
so i don' t have to do it anymore .
the child was 12 years old , for crying out loud !
forensic investigation shows that the girl is the victim of a brutal murder .
her identity has now been released .
it' s 12 year old brigitte cuypers , from merksem .
she was recently involved in child prostitution .
that case also cost her father his life .
have i been here all night ?
say it .
have i been here all night ?
yes .
where else ?
come on , you have to go .
get dressed .
sorry .
back !
yes , but your pills ...
back !
you have to go back !
back !
shit .
you were right , gilles .
people like us don' t retire .
vincke !
we have a witness .
a hotel guest .
mister casoni ...
your passport .
thank you .
hello .
vincke , chief .
you can speak flemish , chief .
i' m from everywhere and nowhere .
this gentleman knows the identity of the victim .
i just saw him get in .
the poor guy .
his name is ledda .
angelo ledda .
how do you spell that ?
like in the swan , but with two d' s .
that' s greek mythology .
basic knowledge .
so you know mr. ledda ?
yes ...
from here , in the bar .
a friendly person .
retired .
a real frenchman .
this was found under another car .
a credit card to angelo ledda' s name .
guys , have a look !
i was waiting for that .
it' s not your day .
baron ?
it' s time .
no , that' s ok .
joseph can give the injection .
you guys are good at that , right joseph ?
psychiatrists don' t always knock people out , gustave .
sometimes we talk to our patients .
before or after the injection ?
baron de haeck .
yes , it' s me .
turn on the tv , baron .
teletext , brt , page 101 .
what do you think ?
say what you want about those frenchies , but when they make a mistake , they fix it .
with a bulldozer if they have to .
you can sleep well , baron .
don' t worry .
it' s all over .
that is , if you didn' t forget about me .
you didn' t forget about me , did you , baron ?
great .
if i may say so .
nothing beats doing business with an honest person .
there , our friend casoni .
but according to the french , this is the only bernard casoni .
young guy , centre half of olympique marseille , since 5 years .
you see , in our job , it' s better to know your football than your greek mythology .
so what do we know ?
angelo ledda .
yes , the credit cards are fakes .
in france they don' t know him .
and here ?
here they do .
the juvenile court has a file on him .
unfortunately , this ledda has been dead for 40 years .
let them send it anyway .
and the woman in the suitcase ?
that' s anja laeremans .
a prostitute , according to the barman .
no pimp , no criminal record .
also no family or friends , unfortunately .
we keep searching .
revenge in the prostitutes scene ?
and what does an over achiever think ?
yes , yes .
why not ?
maybe the nijvel gang is also involved .
chief ?
things are the way you thought .
the bullets are from the same gun .
the woman has been shot by the murderer of bieke .
now what ?
problems ?
impossible .
you' re dead .
no , you' re dead .
two bullets in the chest and one through the head .
again .
he isn' t cold yet .
want to feel ?
never mind .
stimorol .
he arrives , wants to open his gate .
the detector has been sabotaged .
he gets out and bam .
coemans ... did you give them the car ?
affirmative , chief .
i am for 69 .
an even sicker mind than yours , freddy .
mrs. seynaeve ...
chief vincke and inspector verstuyft .
we' re very sorry , ma' am .
life goes on .
if you were expecting tears and a black veil ,
i have to disappoint you .
but if you have questions , shoot .
where did your husband come from at such a late hour ?
he was gone for business .
with whom and where ...
i don' t know .
we don' t talk about that .
we don' t talk a lot anyway .
i' m not a big talker .
did your husband receive any threats in the past ?
not from me .
did he have enemies ?
no .
no , only friends .
my husband had many friends .
what i' m about to say , sounds harsh .
but we found this in your husband' s mouth .
any idea ?
no idea .
but i' m glad there still are some honest people .
or aren' t you honest ?
yes , i am .
i am , just a bit suspicious by nature .
if i give it to you , will you let me go ?
i swear i won' t talk .
if that idiot really thinks he ...
is he inside ?
yes .
what are you doing ?
good morning to you too , jean .
didn' t you hear ?
seynaeve has been shot .
impossible .
daddy , what on earth are you doing ?
that guy is walking around outside here .
i wish ...
' i wish ' is for old bags .
' i want ' .
don' t worry .
he doesn' t know me .
all leads end with seynaeve .
says who ?
seynaeve ?
says i.
bastards .
fucking bastards .
nothing .
we have nothing , people .
four murders and all we have are facts .
we need to connect the facts .
prostitution .
revenge .
but ...
bieke cuypers is child prostitution .
and anja is hotel prostitution .
two totally different scenes .
seynaeve has got nothing to do with prostitution .
he' s in another league .
but he' s been killed the same way as bieke cuypers .
not with the same weapon .
seynaeve' s bullets are of a different calibre .
chief .
chief .
bernard casoni !
is that legal ?
no , it' s japanese .
vincke .
did you read the papers , chief ?
the woman in the suitcase doesn' t have anything to do with it .
she was an angel .
and you know what happened and want to help us ?
help ?
i' m doing your job for you .
get the scum of the streets , because you' re too slow .
i don' t have much time left .
and who are the scum ?
i can' t tell you yet .
then why do you call us ?
if i can' t finish it , you' il have to .
do you want the real bastards behind all this ?
yes .
keep searching and you' il find them .
unless we find you first .
mister ...
ledda ?
well done .
you already know my name .
i do now .
doesn' t matter .
i have nothing to lose .
just my head .
ok , we' ve got him .
075/ 56 . 28 . 36 .
coemans , check with belgacom .
no need .
that' s seynaeve' s number .
why do these thugs have a mobile and we don' t ?
ledda is our man .
and we still have nothing .
vincke ...
remember how mrs. seynaeve was talking about those friends and how she reacted to the money ?
can i try something ?
if we pressure her a bit , she' il open up .
you' d like that , wouldn' t you ?
for her to open up .
let me give it a go .
freddy , i can' t allow that .
vincke , you said it yourself .
sometimes you have to go against the rules .
mrs. seynaeve ?
you almost look like a pro .
the door was open .
don' t you know a better way of coming in ?
thanks for letting me see you .
shoot .
do you know angelo ledda ?
no .
bernard casoni ?
big ?
blond ?
dark .
i know lots of those .
but , no , the name doesn' t ring a bell .
he called us on your husbands mobile .
what do you think about that ?
i should get it disconnected .
your act is very impressive .
i beg your pardon ?
do you think i don' t know why you' re here ?
ma' am , i' m ...
what did you think ?
i should put here up against the wall ?
i think you know more than you' re saying .
oh , you' re a real thinker .
i thought you were more about action .
come .
we can make each other happy .
angelo ledda ?
no , never heard of him .
but that other name , casoni ...
i overheard that name once during a phone call ...
with de haeck .
the concrete baron ?
the former minister ?
you asked for a name , not a family tree .
come on ...
drink up before it gets too warm .
never on duty .
fucking belgian cop .
vincke ...
we have a name .
compliments of mrs. seynaeve .
de haeck .
minister of state ?
his son .
jean de haeck .
he resigned last month as director general of planning .
who was his successor ?
bob van camp .
fireworks ?
i think so .
where does he live ?
no , go on .
they' il call back .
blackmail .
that' s it .
for years , van camp has been missing out on all these goodies .
they all go to big shots , like jean de haeck .
then he discovers de haeck' s weak spot .
children .
bieke cuypers .
he' s not answering .
again .
van camp blackmails de haeck and steals his promotion from him .
