you know what i' m talking about .
last time out , i went down , and you disappeared .
look , you aren' t the only one who lost something that day .
when the fire started , you were busy with the general .
some of us went in to see who we could save .
now , you think this looks bad ?
you should' ve seen it before i got it fixed .

okay , i see you .
hey , get your ass out the driver' s seat .
mission accomplished .
darius stone .
born south side , d. c. mother died young , father raised him .
not much to report till ' 88 .
his dad was killed by a stray bullet in a 211 , and darius went off the grid .
started with graffiti , reckless driving .
quickly worked his way up to grand theft auto and resisting arrest .
took him some time to find his calling in the navy .
specifically , the navy seals .
trained sniper , top scores .
urban recon , demolition .
the highest dive in navy history , 250 feet .
augustus gibbons recruited him into an elite unit , level 5 classified .
ran ops in eastern europe till christmas in kosovo .
their general ordered them to set a fire to clear civilians ... ... but stone refused .
led a mutiny against a four star general ... ... the current secretary of defense , george deckert ... ... who had him court martialed for a 20 year term .
ten for disobeying direct orders ... ... and another 10 for breaking the general' s jaw .
this is the last footage we have on him .
a meeting with his lawyer , jonathan edward cochran .
oh , that' s cute .
johnnie cochran .
i don' t think mr. stone can afford johnnie' s fee .
do we have audio ?
it' s attorney client .
no mikes .
hold it there .
okay , reel it back .
back , back , back .
freeze it .
blow it up .
gibbons and stone on a comeback tour .
all right , listen up .
i want all eyes up and running on these two .
and i want hard 20s on the rest of their old unit .
i wanna know where they are ... ... i wanna know what they' re doing , and i wanna know now .
i' m disappointed , auggie .
checkmate in three ?
you should' ve seen it coming .
relax .
have a drink .
i took the liberty of pouring myself ...
you were always taking liberties .
same old gibbons .
good soldier with a bad attitude .
you know , i always remember the first day we met .
i remember the last day i saw you .
i bet you do .
didn' t heal too well , did it ?
some wounds never do .
i never asked you to go into that fire .
you just set it and watched it burn .
we did what needed to be done .
is that what you call it ?
doing what you need to do " ?
sixteen of my men killed ?
what' s that , just more friendly fire ?
some men die so others may live .
funny ... ... that you never seem to be the one doing any of the dying .
i' il do whatever it takes to best protect this nation .
you' re not protecting the nation .
you' re doing this to protect yourself .
why ?
what fires you starting now ?
we both live in the same world .
we know what' s out there .
save the speech .
just so you know ... ... whatever you' re up to , you' re not getting away with it .
why ?
because darius stone is gonna stop me ?
i' m sorry .
was that supposed to be a surprise ?
gibbons , i know every move you make even before you do .
you still work for me , whether you know it or not .
i never worked for you .
i work for my country .
i don' t know what' s more pathetic ... ... a man that plays chess with himself ... ... or a man that doesn' t see he' s already lost .
make it look like an accident .
zero exposure .
sir , they found gibbons .
<i>investigators say an apparent</ i> <i>gas leak triggered the explosion . </ i>

so , what is he doing here ?
charlie .

oh , so now you wanna blend .
i hear this place has the best gumbo in town .

how did you know my name ?
who are you ?
we have a mutual friend .
augustus gibbons .
had a mutual friend .
and you didn' t answer my question .
who are you ?
my name is darius stone .
stone ?
you have half the suits in this city looking for you .
why in the world would you come here ?
trust me ... ... they won' t look for a guy like me in a place like this .
well , no offense , but i don' t trust anybody right now .
good .
that means we got something in common .
charlie .
i' m sorry i' m so late .
i had that urban youth meeting .
it ran over .
we' re trying to set up that after school ... ... gun instructional program for kids and ...
i' m sorry .
dickie ambrose , nra .
hi .
reverend billy bob baker , southern baptist brotherhood .
well , it' s just great to meet you , reverend .
hey , listen , we' re setting up this rally upstate next week ... ... and i was just wondering if there was some way we could attract ... ... you know , some upstanding african americans like yourself .
you got any advice for us ?
well , dick , perhaps you could tell your members ... ... to stop buying country music , stop burning crosses ... ... and stop shooting black folks .
hear me ?
now , if that don' t work ... ... try a cookout with free food .
preferably fried .
dick ... ... would you mind terribly if we rescheduled ?
i think that would be ...
yeah , that' s fine .
i have a lot of stuff to do .
reverend , i' il ...
call me .
i' il call you about that .
tell me about you and the captain .
i was gibbons ' contact on the hill .
i' m an aide to the senate subcommittee on military action .
military ?
deckert .
secretary of defense deckert ?
there' s not a bullet shot in the dark that he don' t know about .
so tell me something , charlie .
can you get me close to him ?
well , reverend ... ... you think you can lay your hands on a tuxedo ?
you made it .
you know , i never miss a party .
not quite the tux i had in mind .
yes , but i' m blending .
you see the guest of honor ?
those bodyguards ?
seal team four .
half my old unit .
and not the better half .
who' s the ugly general he' s talking to ?
jack pettibone .
vice chair , joint chiefs .
doesn' t look too happy .
must be the music .
one way to find out .
i truly can' t believe what i' m hearing .
we go back 30 years , jack .
same blood in the same mud , and you never questioned my command .
i presume you' ve heard of the united states congress .
jack ... ... this country is being led down the wrong path .
you really think you can do this , don' t you ?
with just a few regiments .
once we lead , the full force will follow .
the clock is ticking .
with or without you .
three days .
he' s here .
black guy , white tux .
had enough of the party ?
hold on .
you asked me to track down the rest of their old troop ?
well , half of them are still enlisted .
what about the other half ?
gone .
missing .
the same men that backed stone against deckert .
every single one of them just disappeared .
wait a minute .
this is your home ?
not bad for a senator' s aide .
i' m not just a senator' s aide .
i' m also a senator' s daughter .
james mayweather , virginia .
think daddy' s ready to meet a guy like me ?
actually , daddy' s out of town .
really ?
make yourself at home , darius .
not a bad place to grow up , i guess .
only on the surface .
growing up in d. c. politics is like living in a snake pit .
everybody fighting for territory .
sounds a lot like where i grew up .
oh , no .
this is nothing like where i grew up .
let' s get you out of those clothes , shall we ?
here we go .
why don' t you try these on .
not really my style .
why don' t you go ahead and get cleaned up .
there' s some fresh towels in the bathroom .
full service , huh ?
you know , if you need anything ... ... l' m just right down the hall .
anything ?
anything at all .
how about some fries and a shake ?
the things i can' t do for my country .
charlie ?
charlie .
pettibone ?
she set me up .
bitch .
<i>this is the police . </ i>
<i>come out with your hands</ i> <i>behind your head . </ i>
we got the vice chair of the joint chiefs in there .
the assailant is armed and dangerous .
proceed with extreme caution , gentlemen .
gus , get me a hostage negotiator , clear a two block radius ... ... and five is the active perimeter .
better make that 10 .
captain , the man' s a special forces sniper .
keep all fields clear at least half a mile downwind .
who the hell are you ?
kyle steele , nsa .
captain , i need to speak to this man alive .
so ?
it' s a matter of national security , sir .
where the hell are you going ?
going inside .
listen , i don' t care who you are .
you got six minutes till we breach .
stone .
i' m coming in unarmed .
all right , close that door .
hands .
step forward .
how you know i wouldn' t shoot you the second you stepped through ?
i didn' t .
you got five minutes till they knock that door down .
so let' s skip the chitchat .
where' s pettibone ?
upstairs , dead .
you do it ?
lf i did it ... ... you wouldn' t know until i wanted you to .
now , turn around .
stone , this doesn' t look too good , man .
an escaped convict breaks into a house with an automatic in hand ... ... and a dead man upstairs .
i didn' t break in .
now , move .
you didn' t break in here ?
so , what , the general invited you over for a nightcap ?
what happened ?
you guys felt like playing russian roulette ?
this is not my gun .
you expect me to buy that line ?
it' s not a line , it' s the truth .
they set me up .
who set you up ?
deckert .
deckert .
secretary of defense deckert .
he clipped gibbons when he got too close .
and now pettibone .
too close to what ?
stone , we have three minutes .
level with me .
why are we here ?
why' d you go after pettibone ?
i didn' t go after nobody .
i don' t even know the guy .
never seen him before in my life .
easy .
that sure looks a lot like you .
damn , they' re good .
think now is really the best time for a snack ?
what they got out there , three teams ?
flash bangs , body armor , heat scopes .
am i close ?
stone , i wanna help you here , i really do .
but if you run , you look guilty .
brother , i was born looking guilty .
and now ... ... it' s time for you to go .
where is he ?
where is he ?
captain , i got him .
looks like upstairs bathroom .
okay , go get him .
<i>this is the last known photograph</ i> <i>of the suspect . </ i>

pettibone and deckert both served for over 30 years together .
so that means pettibone' s troops are also ... ?
deckert' s .
correct .
what' s that got to do with the funeral ?
the perfect cover .
deckert does the guest list ... ... only invites his boys to town .
he' s got his army .
now , he' s gotta be loading up .
how would he get his gear ?
all orders go through his department , the dod .
right .
you want me to hack in ?
to the u. s. department of defense ?
we' re talking 500 acres of hardware .
cray supercomputers , encryption chips ... ... not to mention more firewalls than the nsa , cla and the irs combined .
exactly .
hold my chips .
you know , you don' t have to wait up .
you think i' d leave you alone with my car ?
what' s so special about this one ?
shelby cobra prototype , 600 horses , 10, 000 rpm .
only three off the rack .
and we sold it for half a mil to some senator ... ... who' il never take her out of first gear .
half a mil for a car ?

it' s a map of the capitol .
a military map .
with attack routes , targets ...
i see that .
where' d you get it ?
upstate .
deckert' s little boy scouts are gearing up for world war iv .
they got tanks , choppers .
they got gibbons .
what do you mean ?
gibbons is not dead .
he' s locked up with half my old unit .
upstate ?
correct .
deckert is setting them up for a fall .
fall for what ?
what do you think ?
this man is making a move on the u. s. capitol .
see this ?
map came from national recon .
yeah , deckert' s making a move .
he' s running security ... ... for the state of the union tonight .
he' s not attacking , he' s guarding these targets .
oh , that' s beautiful .
perfect cover .
he' s got his old crew suited and booted .
look , these boys don' t play defense .
just offense .
it' s not enough .
what if you' re wrong ?
i was wrong .
i thought you was more than just another suit .
sir , the security detail ... ... they' re all ex military .
yeah , i can see that .
all of them served with gibbons and stone .
it' s deckert' s unit .
think we got something .
world war iv .
anything the defense department needs to know ?
sure it' s nothing you don' t already know , sir .
george deckert .
secretary deckert ... ... this is agent steele .
kyle , the secretary wanted to check in on the gibbons case .
i have a personal interest in the case .
captain gibbons was a friend .
well , you can rest assured we' re doing everything we can to find him .
find him ?
you know , we never did id his body .
terrible thing , accident like that .
could happen to anyone .
tell me , kyle , what did darius stone say to you ?
what do you mean ?
you were the last to talk to him ... ... before he got away .
he didn' t say much .
no , just a bunch of wild conspiracy theories , that' s all .
sounds like stone .
well , if you hear anything ...
i' il know who to chase down .
sir , could you tell me something ?
i' ve always wondered ... ... how do you pick the men who protect the president ?
simple .
i choose men i can trust .
like gibbons .
would' ve been good to have him there tonight , huh , sir ?
oh , he' il be there .
in spirit .
i' m sure he will .
good luck , sir .
sounds like the right bank' s running leaner than the left .
you wanna richen her up , you' re gonna have to remap the ecu .
what , are you surprised ?
yeah .
fact you know how to tune up a truck .
i didn' t always wear a suit .
how' d you find me ?
it' s my job , darius .
i' m very good at it .
can we talk ?
you were right .
deckert knew gibbons was alive .
look at this .
president , vp , speaker of the house , secretary of state .
the chain of command .
he takes them out , he' s what ?
deckert becomes the new president .
that' s right .
cleanest revolution in history .
yeah .
why are you here ?
call the white house .
can' t .
we don' t know how deep this goes .
so , what' s your plan ?
figure we gotta go outside the box on this one .
how far outside the box are you prepared to go ?
because to get us close to the capitol ... ... we' re gonna need some brothers we can trust .
ain' t no place like home .
man , y' all almost had me too .
they got jokes , man .
you hear that ?
they got jokes .
no joke .
we need your help .
so why don' t you go to the police ?
we don' t trust the police .
heard that .
hold this , baby .
one second .
man , you know we got your back .
but this ain' t got nothing to do with us .
this got everything to do with you .
don' t do it for the red , white and blue , do it for yourself .
do it for the right to hack and jack cars of the highest quality ... ... on the same block as the white house .
it' s the american way of life , bro .
now , if you wanna protect that way of life ... ... then you gotta step up and fight for it .
because if deckert takes over , freedom won' t be free for long .
nice speech .
yeah .
the freedom part was a bit much , though .
i got some federal heat .
immigration , irs .
couple of homeboys unjustly accused .
i do this for you , you' il hook us up ?
i' il do what i can .
fair enough .
all right , fellas , get your gear together .
we got some work to do .
janky , kevlar panels .
killa , super jacks .
dizzle , heavy duty roll cages .
assholes and elbows , gentlemen .
let' s go .
toby .
to deal with these guys , we' re gonna need some serious gear .
well , it' s about time .
god , i am so glad to hear you say that , x.
i got some stuff you' re gonna love .
laser scope ... ... frequency lock , gps autotracker .
this will tell you what perfume a chick' s wearing ... ... from 30 miles away .
that' il come in handy .
so will these .
basic scramblers , jammers , circuit jacks .
whatever you need .
now , this is the house special .
i call this one the glove .
so does everybody else .
not everybody else has electro charge pneumatic suction .
turn this bad boy on ...
see ?
nothing .
nothing at all .
chill out with the butt ...
don' t .
just ...
hey , hey .
hey .
come on , man .
why you gotta play around here ?
hey !
we need firepower .
do you have anything that shoots bullets ?
i don' t , but homeland security does .
lola .
come on , man , please .
okay .
i' il just call the pentagon and see if they deliver .
we don' t have to .
they' ve been running weapons across country ... ... in civilian trucks .
civilian trucks ?
man , i' m hungry .
you just ate five minutes ago .
what if i go in the back and get a slice of cheese ?
you' d stop at one slice .
what does homeland defense need with a truck full of cheese anyway ?
you ain' t never heard of government cheese ?
let' s give them a little assistance .
hi , boys .
ladies .
look like you' re overheated .
i know we are .
i mean your car .
i' m not going out without a fight .
he' s retarded .
key' s in the truck .
move the level , because the brakes get stuck .
hi , i' m agent shavers .
we' il be commandeering your truck today .
man , we can' t let nobody know a white guy hijacked us .
we' il say it was 75 black guys .
we got a truck full of guns , they pay us to haul cheese ?
that' s not cheese ?
so , what you think , d train ?
this enough bang for you ?
god bless america .
you' re going to take the president out , aren' t you , george ?
no , captain , you are .
they pull the trigger , you take the fall .
no one would ever believe i ...
what ?
augustus gibbons always fought the system .
this week , that fight became a war .
he took out his own nsa unit ... ... broke a convict out of a maximum security prison ... ... staged his own death , ordered the murder of jack pettibone ... ... and rallied his old troop of traitors for one last stand .
i believe it .
you know what your problem is , auggie ?
you' ve never been able to see beyond the bend .
and you' ve never been able to see beyond yourself .
you' ve had your hero' s funeral , gibbons .
this time , they' re gonna bury you in a pine box in an unmarked grave .
i' m not buried yet .
he' s one man , captain .
what can one man do ?
deckert' s got all the streets locked down .
three blocks in every direction .
there are some streets he don' t know about .
at the east capitol and eighth street ... ... we use alleys and warehouses to bust out behind the capitol .
gonna have tanks waiting .
leave the tanks to me .
if it got wheels , we can jack it .
trust me , daddy o .
all right , let' s roll .
all right , gentlemen .
lock and load .
time to ride out .
the fate of the free world in the hands of a bunch of hustlers and thieves .
why should tonight be any different ?
as you can see behind me , the president is just arriving ...
the nation is eager to hear the president' s stance on pressing issues .
chief among them , the new military bill .
ladies and gentlemen , the president of the united states .
<i>mr .
speaker, </ i> <i>my fellow americans ... </ i> ... tonight i stand before you to report ... ... that the state of our union is strong .
<i>we are at a critical moment</ i> <i>in our history . </ i>
nice .
get crunk , x. come on , steele , get crunk with us .
we now need the courage to reevaluate ... ... the course of modern american democracy ... ... if we are to truly flourish and survive .
looks like we got a little block party up ahead .
go through it .
hold on .
we must use understanding ... ... and compassion ...
they' re shooting at us .
welcome to the ' hood , college boy . ... and compromise to win battles ...
... and not just the sacrifices ... ... of the lives of our young men and women .
fellas ... ... i don' t mean to be a back seat driver ... ... but isn' t that a dead end ?
there' s no such thing as a dead end .
now , that' s what i' m talking about !
oh , shit .
i think you might wanna back up right about now .
go , go , go .
everybody out now .
i told you they' d have tanks waiting .
and i told you ... ... if it got wheels , we can jack it .
move it .
get those jacks out of there .
welcome to the first tank jacking in history .
we can and must endeavor ... ... to win the hearts and minds of our enemies ... ... and turn them into our allies .
and so , my fellow americans ... ... i will ask you tonight to support this new ...
what' s going on ?
we need to move you .
remain in your seats .
no cause for alarm .
okay , let' s put these dubs to work .

you' re a jefferson man .
the tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time ... ... with the blood of patriots .
and tyrants .
