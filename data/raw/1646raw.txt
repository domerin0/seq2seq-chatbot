we have to ignore it .
if we pay attention , the goons' il know the hut' s important .
here' s to going home .

they' ve searched it a hundred times .
home !
anyway , i' m glad we' ve got you in the tunnel with us .
to tom , eh ?
och , never mind .
you' il be walking down argyle street in a couple of weeks .
to tom .
you know , sandy , i' m just beginning to realise that myself .

we' re nearly at the trees , boy .
we' re nearly at the trees , eh ?
herr hauptfeldwebel !
herr hauptfeldwebel !

he wasn' t caught .
hilts , welcome home .
danny ?
danny ?
danny ?
are you all right , danny ?
yes .
all right .
all right .
bring some shovels .
i' m all right .
for god' s sake , you' ve left out a whole eagle .
that' s impossible .
yes .
four days ' work up the bloody spout !
i' m sorry , colin .
it' s all right , smithy .
it' s getting late .
you push off to bed .
i' il pack up here .
all right .
good night , colin .
good night , smithy .
i can' t see a bloody thing .
your german' s very good .
thanks , mac .
i' ve put in a lot of ...
watch it .
that' s the easiest way to trip up a suspect .
don' t fall for that old gag .
i' m sorry , mac .
ok .
but remember , german always .
one , two , three , four , five .
roger .
no , it' s me .
how do you like the old escape suit ?
fine , fine .
colin .
how do you like mine ?
it looks splendid .
where are you going ?
you' il get yourself shot .
what' s the matter with you ?
i' m going out through that fence .
danny , we' re getting out through the tunnel .
we' re almost clear .
please , willie , let me alone .
i can' t go in that tunnel any more .
so i' m going out through the wire .
danny , think .
we' re getting out , but not through the wire .
we' re getting out through the tunnel .
it' s finished .
i go out now .
no .
danny , you go through that wire and you' il get killed .
don' t do that .
willie ...
since i was a boy ,
i hate and feared little rooms , closets , caves .
danny , you' ve dug 17 tunnels .
over 17 tunnels .
because i must get out .
i hide the fear , and i dig .
but tomorrow night in the tunnel with all those men ,
i' m afraid maybe this time i will lose my head and ruin the escape for everybody .
so i go now .
danny , i' il see you through the tunnel .
i' il look after you .
i' il stick with you all the way .
all right .
good evening .
hello , roger .
well , how do you think we look ?
it' s as bad as all that ?
colin , i want first of all to say that without you , we would not have been ready .
that' s all right .
i had lots of help .
lots of very good help .
what' s the matter , roger ?
you can' t go .
what do you mean ?
i can' t allow it .
why ?
you can' t see your hand in front of your face .
you' d be caught before you got 10 yards .
that' s ridiculous .
that' s ridiculous .
never heard anything so absurd in my life .
i can see perfectly .
i can see perfectly !
i can see ... that pin down there .
does that satisfy you ?
what pin ?
where ?
colin , do you see the foot of the door ?
yes , of course .
put the pin down there , will you ?
all right .
all right .
come on .
come on .
sit down .
sit down .
it was a good try .
i hate these last minute letdowns , but i' ve only just been told .
it' s too risky for you .
don' t you think that' s colin' s decision ?
no , i don' t .
come on , roger .
we all know the score here .
well , at least , most of us do .
your idea of this escape is to start another front , to foul up the germans behind the lines .
all right , that' s fine .
but once we get past that wire and have them looking all over germany for us , that mission is accomplished .
afterwards , we have some ideas of our own .
you mean getting home ?
back to your family ?
that' s right .
do you really believe i haven' t thought about that too ?
i' m sure you have .
i know colin has .
and , roger , i have too .
we think we can make it all the way .
not colin .
he' d be an appalling hazard to the escape .
that must be my decision .
let' s talk about hazard .
let' s talk about you .
you' re the biggest hazard we have .
the gestapo has you marked .
no one has said you can' t go .
that' s true .
i have thought about the gestapo .
but if you' re asking me how far a commanding officer is allowed to go , or dare go , or should be permitted to play god ,
i can' t answer you .
but i can tell you a blind man is an unnecessary hazard to himself and the whole plan , and must therefore be eliminated from the operation .
colin' s not a blind man as long as he' s with me , and he' s going with me .
it' s all right with you , colin ?
oh , yes .
quite .
very well .
i' il arrange for your escape numbers to be altered accordingly .
good night , gentlemen .
actually ... he' s quite right .
he' s completely right .
i really shouldn' t go at all .
my eyes have been getting worse and worse lately .
i think they call it progressive myopia .
i can see things up here .
close to .
i can see to work , but ... you' re just a blur .
i know .
oh , hell .
we' il make it in great shape .
colin , do you have any tea ?
yes , of course .
then let' s have some .
splendid .
hi , hilts .
hey , mac .
when ?
tonight .
we thought they' d never let you out .
me , too .
let' s get at it .
bartlett' s waiting for you .
i' il be there .
what time ?
only eight minutes now , danny .
you ok ?
cavendish .
griff , down there .
goff , there .
smith , foles , third on the right .
blythe , hendley , third on the left .
there are the lights .
right on the tick , danny .
look down the tunnel , danny .
it' s lovely .
it' s just like blackpool at the height of the season .
you ever been to blackpool , danny ?
yes .
no .
i don' t know .
it' s time , roger .
bartlett , macdonald , ashley pitt .
it' s all clear , sir .
all set , roger .
roger .
good luck .
they' re coming down the shaft now , danny .
and then they' il be coming right up the tunnel .
willie ...
i can' t wait .
i must get out .
danny !
danny !
danny !
danny !
what is it , danny ?
what' s the matter ?
danny !
come here !
roger ?
danny and i' il go later .
we' il take another place .
danny , tell me what this is and tell me quickly !
this tunnel is mine as much as anybody .
i dug it .
i built it .
i was buried many times .
i go when i want .
let me out .
let me out .
take him out , willie .
take him out .
danny ?
what is it ?
danny , what' s going on ?
it' s all right , sedgwick .
it' s all right .
we' re going later .
danny , it' s all right .
it' s all right .
we can take another place in the line .
it' s all right .
all right , colin .
down you go .
sit down .
feel the top rung of the ladder with your right foot .
got it ?
down you go .
danny cut out , huh ?
willie took him up top .
hilts , i ...
remember , keep your head down .
right .
right .
bartlett .
all right ?
hold on to yourself .
you' re 20 feet short .
what do you mean ?
20 feet short of the woods .
the hole is in the open .
the guard is between us and the lights .
how could that happen ?
what the hell difference does it make ?
it' s happened .
roger ...
damn it , mac !
i' m trying to think !
we could postpone it .
all the documents are dated today .
it' s now or never .
one chance .
when the guard goes to the far end , you might be able to move out .
i think i can make it to the woods , set up a signal when you' re clear .
what about the towers ?
they' re gonna be watching the compound , not the woods .
mac , pass the word .
send down 30 feet of rope .
send down 30 feet of rope !
send down 30 feet of rope .
send down 30 feet of rope !
what ?
30 feet of rope !
what do they want that for ?
how should i know ?
get the rope .
how' s it going ?
have you heard ?
some kind of foul up , i think , sir .
haven' t they moved into the tunnel yet ?
i don' t think so , sir .
he' s over there .
right .
you go first , eric .
i' m staying here till we get moving .
see you in piccadilly .
scott' s bar .
right .
thank you .
good luck .
right .
we' re moving .
danny , they' re moving through the tunnel now .
they' re getting out .
when warsaw fell , you escaped and came to england because you' re a flier .
you came because you wanted to fly with us and fight the germans .
we can get out now .
we can get back to england .
if you don' t go through that tunnel , everything you' ve done will have been for nothing nothing !
blythe' s behind , mac .
right .
in here , colin .
sit down .
you' re up , sedgwick .
i' il take over .
what have you got in here ?
a piano ?
that' s very funny , mate .
you won' t get this thing through .
i' il cope .
was that sedgwick with his trunk ?
who else ?
i wish he was home with his kangaroos .
we' re 20 feet short .
how the hell ... ?
hilts is on the other end of that rope in the woods .
as soon as you feel a couple of tugs , off you go , but keep colin low .
good luck , colin .
thanks , mac .
what' s that ?
it' s an air raid .
oh , god !
no !
the goons' il pull the switches .
we' il lose the lights in the tunnel .
come on , colin .
we can get out when the lights go down .
willie .
willie !
it' s an air raid .
searchlights are out .
come on !
get ' em out .
it' s gonna give !
danny .
danny .
danny , it' s all right .
danny , it' s the lights .
light the lamps down there !
there' s been an air raid and they' ve cut the lights .
danny , it' s all right .
listen to me !
danny , look .
come on , fellas .
move !
move !
we can get dozens out in this darkness .
what the hell' s going on ?
you go .
no .
danny .

what is this , willie ?
danny .
is he stuck in there ?
he' s all right .
get him out fast .
come on .
come on , danny , move .
up you go .
give me your bag .
we' re on the rope !
you and i had better get out , or we won' t have a chance of any of the trains .
it' s moving .
we' il just have to pass the instructions from man to man .
right .
i' il be right behind you .
come on , come on .
come on .
hey !
don' t shoot !
don' t shoot !
don' t shoot !
get off !
we' re coming back !
oh , boy .
there' s a hell of a lot of shooting going on up there .

we would' ve heard the shots before .

that' s quite exciting .
it isn' t stopping .
no , we' re all right .
switzerland .
hey !
bartlett .
where were you going , cavendish ?
i ...
i hadn' t quite decided .
what information were you to collect on the way ?
none .
what sabotage directions did you receive ?
what have you done with your papers ?
papers ?
forged papers and identity cards .
don' t be so stupid .
what did you do with them ?
all i did was escape from a prison camp .
you' d do the same if you' d been locked up for three years .
i wanted to get home .
i don' t think you' il see your wife again .
you' ve got the wrong man .
i' m not even married .
you' re wearing civilian clothes .
you' re a spy .
spies are being shot .
this is my uniform .
i had to recut it when i lost weight .
i dyed it with boot polish to cover some oil smears
i picked up when i was shot down .
and you lost your insignia over the years ?
that' s right .
look ...
that' s all , cavendish .
hello , boys .
hello .
hello , haynes .
hello , cavendish .
i wish i could say i was happy to see you again .
just picked up ?
yes , this morning .
there' s a trainer out there i can fly .
any sentries ?
yeah , it' s gonna be a problem .
colin , when i say go , crank this clockwise .
when the engine catches , don' t move , or you' il get a mouth full of propeller .
go !
next stop , switzerland !
the alps .
splendid .
over this range , then 20 more minutes and we' ve got it made .

i don' t know .
we' re losing power .

herr bartlett ?
your german is good .
and i hear also your french .
your arms ... up !
herr bartlett .
and herr macdonald .
we are together again .
you are going to wish you had never put us to so much trouble .
what' s troubling you , roger ?
i' m just a little surprised .
i expected either a long stay or a very short trip .
yes .
i have to admit , i' m a little worried , though .
i hope to god i haven' t blotted 70 odd ledgers .
och , no , no .
we' re all over 21 , footloose and fancy free .
we' d never have got as far as we did without you , roger .
for what it' s worth , i think you did a damn good job .
i think we all do .
yes .
all right .
you can get out now .
stretch your legs for five minutes .
it will take hours before you reach the camp .
you know , mac , all this the organisation , tunnelling , tom and harry kept me alive .
and even though we ...
i' ve never been happier .
you know , mac ...
1 1 of your men are being returned today .
oh , who ?
i do not have that information .
i ...
i am directed by a higher authority to inform you that ...
50 of your officers were shot while escaping .
shot ?
their ... personal effects will be returned .
how many of them were wounded ?
here are the names ... of the dead .
how many of the 50 were wounded ?
none .
they the higher authority only directs me to inform you that ... that 50 men were ...
i see .
addison , john .
alladale , peter .
bancroft , edward .
bartlett , roger .
cavendish , dennis .
eldridge , david .
felton , william .
fanshaw , arthur .
i am your guide , se ? or .
spain ?
glad to see you' re all safe .
thank you , sir .
how many have been brought back ?
you' re the first .
do you know how many got away ?
not yet .
what happened to blythe ?
he didn' t make it , sir .
roger was right about that .
i' m afraid roger didn' t make it , either .
i' ve just posted the list .
they shot ... 50 .
the gestapo murdered them .
50 ?
macdonald , ashley pitt ?
yes .
danny and willie ?
no , they' re not on the list .
haynes ?
yes .
i' m sorry .
roger' s idea was to get back at the enemy the hardest way he could .
mess up the works .
from what we' ve heard here , i think he did exactly that .
do you think it was worth the price ?
that depends on your point of view , hendley .
yes , sir .
he is not to be saluted .
he' s no longer in command .
the job just didn' t work out , huh ?
you were lucky , hilts .
lucky ?
because i didn' t ...
how many ?
50 .
it looks , after all , as if you will see berlin before i do .
sir .
hey , hilts !
