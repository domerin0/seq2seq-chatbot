ushi , are you there ?
yes .
get something ?
nothing but junk .
this is the best you can get ?
burned kyoto .
the emperor' s escaped to mt . yoshino .
no more big battles .
just skirmishes now .
can' t do any business .
good millet !
one more .
take it or leave it .
want one more ?
sleep with me ?
who' d want you ?
hachi !
you' re back ?
i' m hungry .
give me some food .
get him a bowl !
a wonder you got back !
my husband ?
wait .
you came back alone ?
i escaped !
where' s my son ?
it was the ashikaga army that made us go with them .
we fought twice .
the 3rd time , we got caught by the kusunoki army .
my son too ?
yes , both of us .
so we became kusunoki men .
all the same to us .
not our war .
we didn' t care who won .
there are two emperors now .
kusunoki fights for the emperor at mt . yoshino ...
ashikaga for the kyoto emperor .
it means the two emperors are quarreling .
at first we wanted to be heroes , but killing' s not easy .
might get killed myself .
once i stabbed a man in the back with a spear .
he was in some bushes and i killed him .
my son ?
it was 3 days ago ...
the kusunoki army was beaten flat at minatogawa .
wiped right out by the ashikaga men .
it was a mess .
couldn' t tell friend from foe ... 2 days and 2 nights .
we tried to stick to the safest places .
the general ordered us to advance .
but we ran around till they chased us into a paddy field .
nothing to do but play dead in the mud .
we fooled them .
watching our chance , we ran into the mountains .
hid in the bushes all night , thought we' d starve .
we went to hunt for food .
thought we' d steal from farm houses , but they were empty .
no food .
soon , farmers with sticks came from somewhere and beat us up !
beat kichi to death !
i barely escaped alive !
my son was killed ?
and then ?
the samurai who took you ?
killed right afterwards .
an arrow right through his throat .
here .
served him right !
had it coming to him .
they took my son so sudden , we had a hard time .
i was looking forward to the day he' d return .
only you came back .
it' s a wonder you' re still alive .
how do you eat ?
frost in summer last year .
hail fell .
frost in summer , mind you !
the crops all failed .
strange things going on in kyoto too .
a horse bore a calf .
like the earth was turned upside down !
all the farmers are starving .
always fighting .
can' t work .
the fields run wild with no men .
how do you eat ?
never you mind !
we' re beggars !
kyoto' s burnt down !
not even a dog .
everything becomes food ...
snakes , even earthworms , mice .
wearing nice things .
steal them ?
you look funny yourself .
i killed a priest on the way and put it on .
people trust a priest .
easier to get around in .
what' il you do now ?
is my hut left ?
i suppose so .
i see .
i' il go get some good sleep .
i' m very sleepy .
i' m sorry i came back alone .
what is it ?
it' s sad !
a fine day .
makes war seem far away .
big fish you caught .
nothing to eat .
what do you eat ?
don' t seem to grow anything .
what do you do ?
you steal ?
i see .
that' s it ?
they all do where there' s fighting .
they all steal in kyoto .
you steal too ?
right ?
why didn' t you save my husband ?
no time to !
about 20 farmers attacked us !
all i could do to get away myself !
waited for him ?
poor girl .
what' il you do ?
he' s dead .
no use staying with the old woman .
mind your tongue !
you' re young yet .
how about coming to see me ?
want to ?
a nice day .
hachi , what' re you doing there ?
catching fish .
got to eat .
you eat it .
take what' s offered .
it looks good .
what did he say ?
nothing .
he' s no good .
not even sorry he' s back alone .
he may' ve killed my son !
like an enemy .
don' t be too friendly !
help !
help !
get the one floating away !
he' s alive !
we can eat now !
expensive stuff !
how about it ?
a good buy ?
this all ?
farmers are in the mountains .
had a hard time finding this much .
risky work !
sake !
you were lucky .
a wonder you' re back .
good business you have .
only while the war lasts .
don' t know how much longer .
a long time yet .
until one side' s beaten .
even if it ruins the country .
it' s a business with them .
birds too .
bring good stuff .
ushi' s got himself a good business .
camps will snap up swords , halberds , and armors .
not enough to go around .
none for common soldiers .
they use wooden or bamboo spears .
a good business .
you two do a neat job ?
how many did you kill ?
we' re us !
stay out of it !
hadn' t you better let me join you ?
i' m war trained .
i' il be handy .
we' re us !
we can manage .
hate me for returning alone ?
you' re you .
go it alone .
make me her husband ?
idiot !
don' t be stupid !
we' re turning in !
you go home !
the no good !
he' s after you .
his eyes !
like a dog after a bitch !
sniffing after you .
stay away from him !
that one !
wants a woman !
i want a woman .
come over .
be waiting tonight .
hachi' s after you .
don' t get caught .
who is it ?
who is it ?
it' s you .
you came ?
hachi !
hurry !
hurry !
i get scared running through the reeds .
silly .
you make your living by killing people .
lazy no good .
enjoying his nap .
hachi !
what ?
only you , is it ?
like sleeping ?
nice to nap .
it' s too hot .
best to sleep in the daytime .
sleep with me ?
an old woman like you ?
stupid !
i' m not old inside .
come on .
try me .
i' il go and take a swim .
wait !
what is it ?
something nice ?
don' t act so innocent !
what' re you doing with my daughter in law ?
what' s that ?
i' il slap you !
i saw you !
what' il you do ?
she came to my place .
you asked her .
why not ?
i' m a strong man .
i can' t stand it !
another man' s wife !
your son' s dead .
you no good , coming back alone !
taking your friend' s wife ?
he' s dead .
she needs a man .
and no wonder .
she' s young .
it' s natural .
not if you leave !
go away !
if i do , i' d be taken to war again .
i' il stay here .
then leave her alone !
i' ve an offer .
let her be my bride .
you' ve got your nerve !
my poor son !
can' t ask a young man and woman not to be friends if they' re neighbors .
if my son' s dead , she' s all i' ve got !
i couldn' t get along .
couldn' t even kill !
take her and i' d starve !
don' t worry .
i won' t .
just friends .
in the end , she' il desert me !
i' il tell her not to .
hachi , i' m asking you !
i can' t kill without her !
you ask too much .
your son' s gone it' s selfish to hold her !
when the war ends , i can farm and manage .
till then .
no telling when it' il end .
if you just want a woman , i' d do .
how about me ?
i don' t feel like it .
you intend to take her ?
don' t you know ?
i won' t !
just friends !
you think so , but she' il leave me !
i can' t help that !
remember that !
what' il you do ?
i' il spear you asleep together .
she' il die too then .
old bag !
where to ?
i can' t sleep .
i thought i' d get some fresh air .
yes , it' s hard to sleep tonight .
no wind at all .
no .
dreamed kichi returned .
my son may come back .
hachi saw him die .
he won' t return .
hachi' s a bad man .
he may' ve lied .
he wouldn' t lie !
if kichi' s alive , he' d return .
no use lying !
aren' t you sad my son died ?
i am , but he won' t come back .
i' il find you a good husband .
be patient .
when the war ends , men will come back .
let' s farm again then like we used to .
fighting !
more good game will come our way !
i' il help you .
a wild dog ?
not much spirit for a wild dog .
it' s after a mate .
you pest .
we' il skin you and eat you !
it' s a terrible thing !
once in kyoto , i heard a great priest talk .
people , who sin in this world , go to purgatory when they die .
what' s purgatory ?
the dead are just ashes .
no , no , that' s not so .
there are really hells , they say .
hell of fire , hell of fury , sinners ' hell ...
and the terrible mountain of needles and the pond of blood .
the punishment for sinful love is the heaviest .
souls with human faces grow four legs .
and fall into sinners ' hell .
then they' re tortured with red hot irons .
a lie !
there' s no hell !
there must be hells .
a great priest said so .
it' s no sin what we do .
everyone does it .
with a couple , it' s all right .
with couples ...
it' s quite all right .
it' s a terrible thing .
merciful buddha , merciful buddha ...
let' s go to bed .
calm yourself !
i' m a human being , not a demon .
i' ve reasons for wearing a mask .
i' m a samurai of good family .
as you see , i escaped from the battle .
i became separated from my men .
i hope to return to kyoto but i' m lost in this field of pampas grass .
tell me the road to kyoto .
go straight north and you' il get there !
show me the way out of the grass .
you' il kill me after i take you ?
what good is there in killing the likes of you ?
go alone !
old woman !
you refuse ?
i' il go !
i' il take you !
i missed you ...
i missed you so .
that old woman !
if we sin , do we go to purgatory ?
sin ?
people been doing this thousands of years .
i' d go to purgatory with you !
a vast field of grass .
can' t tell what lives here demons or snakes .
and monsters like you stray in .
i' m a demon .
why do you wear a mask ?
i look stronger with it on , don' t l ?
you lost , you' re running from the war ?
so it' s useless to try to look strong .
you' re right .
many of my men were killed and many others left me .
i was left alone .
punished for beginning a war !
old woman ...
would you like to know why i wear a mask ?
i feared marring my face .
my face is beautiful .
the handsomest face in kyoto .
to protect it , i wore this mask and went into the thick of battle .
as a reward for taking you , show me your beautiful face .
you' d feel faint if you saw my beautiful face .
i' ve never seen anything really beautiful since i was born .
show me your face .
you wish me to so badly .
show me .
a face you' d fall in love with ?
i' ve never seen anyone so beautiful it would take my breath away !
walk on , old woman !
it' s not a face to show peasants !
walk faster !
or i will kill you !
you made many soldiers die ?
a cruel thing .
the dead are the losers .
the dead can' t come back to life again .
don' t talk !
walk !
serves you right !
men like you killed my son !
how beautiful are you ?
the most beautiful face ?
this is a samurai general' s face ?
peace be with you here .
you have friends here .
you made others die .
now , it' s your turn .
heavy ?
no , not very .
shall i go along ?
no , i' il go by myself .
but it' il be night when you return .
if it' s dark , it can' t grow darker .
i' il be late .
eat early and go to bed .
be careful .
what' s the matter ?
you' il catch cold going to sleep there .
what is it ?
are you sick ?
your face is pale .
anything wrong ?
what' s she doing anyway ?
are there really demons ?
well ...
in hell , i guess .
they' re here too !
did you see one ?
no , i didn' t .
we' ve done nothing bad .
a demon couldn' t take us .
might take a bad person though .
shall we eat ?
shall i go to ushi' s place ?
too hot in the daytime .
night' s the best time to go out .
ushi' s a sly one .
if i take too many at once , he knocks down the price .
better to take a few at a time .
we make more that way .
i' il be on my way .
be careful .
what' s the matter ?
a dream ?
what kind of dream ?
you woke me up .
say .
standing me up .
what' s up ?
tired of me ?
it' s raining .
don' t go .
can' t let ushi fool me .
said he didn' t have the millet on hand and to pick it up tonight .
just a shower , so it' il stop .
it' il become nice and cool .
i' il be on my way .
say !
hachi !
a demon !
demon ?
silly !
no such thing !
a demon !
there can' t be .
you imagined it .
there is .
i saw it .
a fox or a badger maybe .
even weasels fool people .
my head' s clear again !
i wish we could live together .
i told you so !
come to my place .
ouch .
a bug in my back !
set yourself free !
i can' t .
i may be punished .
for what ?
buddha' s punishment !
there' s no buddha !
i' il come for you from tomorrow .
wait !
wait !
it' s me !
i' m not a demon !
it' s me .
it' s me !
you' re ... !
it' s me !
i' m your mother !
then that demon every night ... ?
yes !
it was me !
i was wrong !
forgive me !
i wore the mask to scare you .
i' m being punished for it !
the mask won' t come off !
why won' t it ?
why won' t it ?
why won' t it ?
it got wet in the rain and won' t come off !
take it off !
why won' t it come off ?
why won' t it ?
why won' t it ?
look at you !
it' s punishment !
please take it off !
take it off !
please ...
i didn' t sin !
this proves it !
old meddler !
this proves it !
i was wrong !
i was wrong to meddle !
take it off !
you became a demon !
stay that way !
please take it off for me !
i' m asking you !
i' m asking you !
all right , but will you do everything i say ?
i will !
i will !
i will !
exactly as i say ?
yes !
yes !
yes , i will !
can i see hachi every night ?
yes !
daytime too ?
yes !
you won' t complain about us ?
i won' t !
day and night !
you can !
sure ?
i' m sure !
all right , i' il take it off .
it hurts !
it hurts !
what' s happened ?
hurry , take it off !
bear it even if it hurts !
it hurts !
it hurts !
the rain did it !
it hurts !
it' s punishment !
it hurts so ...
it hurts .
it' s that samurai' s curse !
what ?
understand ?
put up with it !
i' m dying .
i' m dying .
it came off .
it came off .
it came off .
the mask came off .
demon !
i' m grateful .
that was good of you .
what is it ?
wait !
i' m not a demon !
i' m a human being !
wait !
i' m a human being !
