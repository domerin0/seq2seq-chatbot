four spanish men with hiking boots had surrounded me close .
i could tell they were banditos because they had taco breath ... and they called me ' hombre . '
i spun around and hit the biggest one .
i punched him in the gut .
and as he was falling , he grabbed my backpack .
i said , ' stop , you banditos !
i don' t want to have to hit anyone else . '
but because they were spanish , they didn' t understand me .
two more jumped me , and i hit one of them in his " between his legs .
my mouth banged on his head .
and that was where i got my fat lip .
the end .
so where' d you get your fat butt ?

the story' s made up .
it' s meant to entertain you and make you think .
kofi , you haven' t spoken up .
all you' ve said is you didn' t like it .
that' s right .
if you can' t say more , i' il assume that you didn' t really read it ... and your mother' s gonna want me to call her .

you just don' t look like you work at smyth and stevens .
you look like a freakin ' boring schoolteacher .
hey , why' d you come here ?
to bust me in the lie about where i work ?
you win .
you coach my kids .
i thought we had a common interest .
elizabeth , i get paid under the table to coach that team .
and i only do that ...
' cause i' m in a big hole with two bookies who are lookin ' to kill me .
what ?
nothing .
you know all this .
i spoke to jimmy fleming after jefferson got beat up .
he told me .
you just think i' m a big joke .
no !
you know , it' s people like me that make people like you ... feel better about your tiny life .
this is unbelievable .
i can' t believe i came down here for this .
yeah ?
then why did you come if you know i' m a liar ?
because those kids trust you .
and they don' t trust anybody .
i told you , i coach for money .
well , i teach for money .
i' ve had the best fifth graders in the world , but some don' t make it .
there' s nobody besides their mother or me telling them what to do .
so what ?
i' m done with all that .
well , i just came down here to see what they see ... because they' re never wrong .
take a good look .
see what they see .
i came to talk to you about a job .
yeah ?
well , unless it pays 12 grand an hour ...
i' m not interested .
did you play it ?
yeah .
twelve grand ?
yes !
twelve grand .
coach !
can we have a word ?
how many points you givin ' ?
i' m getting six .
you took chicago ?
are you on crack ?
you laid 12 grand on those  i' m under a lot of pressure .
i said now !
win or lose , i' m outta here .
darryl mackey , league' s president .
we met .
coach , we' re concerned about the age of some of the boys on your team .
can you produce birth certificates for your players ?
all i got is what coach fleming at smyth and stevens gave me .
here they are .
what are the names of those two boys at second base ?
andre and jamal .
which one' s jamal ?
the taller one .
this birth certificate' s been altered .
what ?
the eight' s been turned into a nine .
you have to be born after september of ' 88 .
well , the kid is out of the league , and the kekambas are on probation .
look , what are you guys the cops ?
what' s the point of the league , coach ?
to teach kids it' s okay to lie , as long as they can get away with it ?
it should be about these kids playing ball ... not the trophy you bring to work .
look , the kid goes now .
okay ?
jefferson bats seventh , plays first base .
miles pitches and bats eighth , and clarence ... you play third and bat ninth .
cool .
okay , let' s go .
why i not playin ' ?
you mad at me ?
jamal , the other coach
' cause i' m sorry about pushing ray ray .
i just want to play .
they know you changed your birth certificate .
i can' t let you play .
but my mom said it was okay .
she said that she would tell them if they asked .
she said it was okay .
i just wanna play .
there' s nothin ' i can do .
look , why don' t you just sit
miles , do your stuff now .
strike .
strike !
out .
yeah , baby .
that' s what i' m talkin ' about .
time , blue .
i can' t have this kid out here with these things on .
what now ?
we' re just all in agreement .
the kid can' t wear headphones while he pitches .
matt makes a good point about safety .
you' re kidding me , right ?
what if he gets hurt because he can' t hear in a dangerous situation ?
there' s liability issues .
bring it in , fellas .
come on , bring it in .
what are you doing ?
i want you guys to explain to them why they lost jamal ... and why miles can' t wear headphones ... and why the bua was and the waatas have nice uniforms ... and we have shitty t shirts .
easy , coach .
you' re already on a warning .
this is the president ... and that is the coach of the goofiest team in the league .
they kicked jamal out because he was born two weeks early ... and now they' re makin ' miles take his headphones off ...
' cause he' s pitchin ' too good .
it' s a safety issue .
fellas , you understand everyone has to follow the same rules .
that' s some weak ass bullshit , you bitch ass , mother freakin ' bustas .
what did you say ?
i believe he said , " that is some weak ass bullshit .

we' ve heard testimony from those very close to our community .
praise jesus .
i want to give a few more people the opportunity to say something on
on jarius' s behalf .
please , mr. o' neill .
come on up .
good morning .
jarius was a player on the kekambas baseball team that i coach .
honestly , he he was too young to play .
but he wanted to be a part of the team so badly that ...
i couldn' t say no .
g baby .
you' re up .
he had a great smile too .
i know i' m not telling you anything you don' t know .
i' ve got jarius evans batting for jefferson tibbs .
he was a really tough guy .
just a boy , really , who ... wanted to be around his older brother .
hang on , coach .
i don' t have jarius evans on this roster anywhere .
oh , you know what ?
there he is .
he' s okay .
the other day ... we played a really important game against a good team .
and , two outs in the last inning ...
i had no choice but to let jarius bat .
you can swing if you want , but you don' t have to .
okay ?
if you go down looking , none of us care .
but if you want to swing , swing .
get back in there .
do what you feel .
he was fearless as he stepped to the plate .
i was terrified for him .
with two strikes and our hopes dwindling ...
he hit a shot down the first baseline ...
and won the game .
and watching him ... raise his arms in triumph ... as he ran to first base ...
i swear ...
i was lifted in that moment to a better place .
i swear he he lifted the world in that moment .
he made me ... a better person ... even if just for that moment .
i am ... forever grateful to jarius for that .
that was nice ... what you said .
his mother was very moved .
thank you .
wait .
there' s some people who want to talk to you about the baseball team .
the team is done .
that' s what they want to talk to you about .
they' re in the auditorium .
we know the league wants to cancel the championship game .
mom said it was all up to us ' cause of g baby .
yeah .
it' s over .
you guys don' t have to play .
you guys had a great year .
you can keep the uniforms .
wait .
you' re quitting again ?
what do you mean ?
we wanna play , bitch .
you guys wanna play ?
hell , yeah !
for g baby .
i' il see you tomorrow at 11 : 00 .
i came to make sure you guys win .
i even made a bet with your friend , ticky .
knowing ticky bet against us improves our chances .
did you really fill out an application to work at the school ?
good luck today .
thank you .
andre , ray ray .
what' s up , coach ?
why don' t you bring everybody in ?
hey , y' all , bring it in !
let' s go !
i want you guys to take a good look at yourselves today and feel proud .
we made it here .
we' re here .
what i' ve learned from you is that ... really , one of the most important things in life ... is showing up .
i' m blown away by your ability to show up ... through everything that' s gone on .
the league never wanted you to play this game ... but you showed up .
but we only have eight players , so
god .
we can' t play .
he was my brother .
he loved to watch us play .
he' s watching us right now .
we gonna play today .
here you go , kofi .
okay , this is for g baby .
g baby .
