how are you gonna pay for this fancy shmancy academy anyway ?
i' m just gonna use the money my parents gave me when i promised they never had to see me again .
but check this out , though .
the pine mountain academy was founded by colonel jaffe , retired , " and since its conception they have produced three gold medalists , four national champions and a saturday morning cartoon series in the netherlands .
hey , maybe you just might fall in love with an academy member .
maybe i will .
they have a state of the art training facility .
check out this pipe !
and they have the steepest vertical in the country .
what' s it called ?
the goat .
only two men have ever skied it and lived .
oooh !
the goat !
death trap .
very cool .
it also says that the locals are a group of colorful natives happy to serve your every need , and only academy members are allowed on the slope .
how' s it going , cornhole ?

at ease , lizzie !
i' il take this young man from here .

it' s a good quality .

well , you know , the video' s a year old .

i' m all chicken skin just thinkin ' about it .
colonel jaffe , retired .
i' m also the coach here at the academy .
ah .
what do you prefer ?
coach " or " colonel " ?
i prefer " god .
but that would be unseemly .
i' d show you around the academy myself , son , but i' m a little busy right now .
so i' m gonna have my daughter winter give you the grand tour .
winter !
report to admissions office , double time , soldier !
do you copy ?
i' m coming , daddy !
i' m coming !
copy that !
thank you .
go , go .
that' s real attractive , brandt .
i' m her daddy .
yes , daddy ?
winter , i want you to meet billy wagstaff , a new member of the academy .
billy , meet winter .
that' s an interesting name , winter .
so is ..
billy .
i named her winter because she' s as pure as the driven snow .
i hear different and someone dies .
now , i want you to show wagstaff here everything the academy has to offer , little girl .
and save that halfpipe till last .
all right ?
we got the best halfpipe in the country , son .
yeah ?
what happened to the other half ?
very humorous .
i want you back here at 0600 for orientation .
maybe you can see how funny myworld is .
man .
let' s go , mr. wagstaff .
hey , winter .
why don' t you let me show the new guy around ?
i' m sure you' ve got better things to do .
thought i did , but they weren' t any better .
i' d be more than happy to show the new member around myself .
come on .
whoo !
yeah , winter !
looking good !
wait till you see the gorge .
it' s tight and wet , but it sure feels good when you go down it .
race you to the bottom .
you got it .
well ?
it' s great .
everything is great .
can we ride it ?
and can you go first ?
you know , just give me the lay of the land .
who told you my nickname ?
oh ho .
follow me if you can keep up .
keeping up is no problem .
god , i love her .
this is a little move i like to call " keep the change .
make sure the steam is blowing up against the boobies so the na nas stand up .
then make sure you get some foam on the ta tas .
and then dip with your finger like this .
and then put your finger all the way in your mouth to lick it off .
there you go .
that' il be four dollars .
keep the change .
that was so .. cool .
yep .
these tits are practically paying for themselves .
i don' t think i have the na nas , the ta tas , the boo boos or the ba bas for that .
you' re right .
those aren' t exactly moneymakers .
but i think we can work with that little ass of yours .
get me a muffin .
ok .
oh , yeah , that works .
looks like i got a new muffin girl .
so , what dorm are you staying in ?
oh , i can' t afford to .
my friend and i are getting a place in town .
in town ?
you' re gonna live with the poories ?
poories ?
that' s what we call the locals in schittville .
poories ' cause they' re poor .
get it ?
poor .. ies .
yeah , um ..
i guess that makes me a poorie .
what do you guys call yourselves ?
the richies , ' cause you' re rich .. ies ?
as a matter of fact , we do .
oh .
clever .
yeah .
i hope you were clever enough to wear a lot of warm clothes .
why ?
because i don' t hang out with poories .
see you in another life hopefully a richer one .
bye bye .
aaaarghhh !
god , i' m in love .
casey richards , welcome to paradise !
oh .
huh ?
i think you made the right choice coming to blind danny temples for all your realty needs .

toodles !
wow .
that is the sweetest , sexiest , most brutal woman i' ve ever met .
i think she kinda digs me .
really ?
aargh !
you know , back in the day , there wasn' t no richies or poories .
there was just whities .. and then there was others .
and guess who got to ski the goddamn mountain .
it wasn' t like they said black folk could only ride the slushy hill , but , hell , we knewwhat " others " meant .
it wasn' t like we didn' t have our own rules on the slushy hill .
i was a poor motherfucker back then , and i could only afford one ski .
so i rode that slushy hill on one .
you invented snowboarding ?
i called it " boogie woogie one ski .
then i realized there was only one way to free up the mountain so all men could use it , and that was to do the one thing that no man had ever done before : ski the goat .
i boogie woogie one skied that goat , and for years after , all men and bitches too could ski pine mountain .
oh , it was beautiful , babies .
but , like everything beautiful , people fucked it all up .
i tried to stop ' em , but ..
i was pretty fucked up my damn self .
well , that' s when the colonel .. the motherfucker stole my one ski idea and had the mountain declared a private skiing academy .
then we was all back on the slushy hill .
brah , why don' t you go do all that shit again and get our mountain back for us ?
yeah !
how am i supposed to do that , balls ?
pretend i' m not tired , bitter and drunk ?
check it out .
it' s the guys from the cafe .
yeah .
let' s just go this way .
no , no .
be polite .
hey !
let me buy you brahs a couple of glasses of suds .
actually , you know , i' m not a bra , mister .
i' m a man .
bras are what are used to hold up women' s breasts .
look , we' re only being nice to you
' cause we like the new muffin girl with the dope ass .
and now we' re not gonna buy you any suds .
academy members only .
william wagstaff .

let me tell you something about losin ' a man .
there ain' t one alive worth sheddin ' a tear over .
drink up , sister .
so you' ve never been in love ?
maybe if i could find the guy that could see past my incredible good looks , perfect figure and the sexiest mouth god ever created .
but i don' t know if i could find a guy like that in schittville .
maybe he' s sitting right next to you .
somebody better get danny away from that beaver before he fucks it again .
so you didn' t tell me you even had a poorie girlfriend .
somebody might need a blood test .
casey ?
she' s not my girlfriend .
i' ve known her since i was , like , six .
she' s kind of like my sister .
i don' t know .
she' s very pretty .
she is ?
look at him , sittin ' over there like he owns the damn place .

and he knows it too .
straight , upstandin ' , cheap ass whiskey drinkin ' motherfucker !
bitch !
daddy , look who i found .
well !

or did my mountain kick your ass ?
my butt' s seen better days , sir .
well , why don' t you get yourself a nice massage tomorrow up at the academy ?
just don' t let that big titted whore at the coffee house stick any needles in your ass .
i hear she almost bled some poor son of a bitch to death .
hi .
i' m brandt von hoffman , pine mountain academy team captain .
second in command .
casey richards .
let me be right up front with you .
i' m a poorie , and proud of it .
are you kidding ?
i don' t play all that stupid richie poorie crap like the rest of those snobs .
no .
to me , people are people .
rich or poor , there' s good and there' s bad people .
but if you' re into that kind of segregation thing , i can split .
no , no !
i ..
i just can' t believe i met someone who isn' t .
so .. if i asked you to have a drink with me you' d do it ?
yeah , i' il be right back .

that sounds like your father .
perfect .
what the hell is goin ' on in there ?
you gotta go .
go !
colonel !
i was just ..
i know what you were doin ' , you goddamn animal .
we don' t go in for that up here at pine mountain .
i don' t knowwhat kind of .. small , blond man you found to perform fellatio on you here in a public environment , but i' m sure his father feels shame unlike any father has ever felt since the dawn of time .
i don' t like you , wagstaff .
you' re always doin ' something that you shouldn' t be doin ' .
dancing on the slopes , disobeying a direct order , havin ' sex in a shitter with what was clearly a man .
matter of fact , you just made it to the top of my shit list .
thank you , sir .
you won' t be disappointed .
all right !
we can' t have nice nice .
move out !
the black man just kicked his own ass .
i got my eye on you , blind man .
i got my ear on you .
nazi fag !
elevate , you limp dicked mother hump ..
it' s pathetic .
wankers !
i' m surrounded by wankers .
i guess you wanna hear me say that that was creative and inventive and fun to watch .
is that what you were thinking , wagstaff ?
i was told it was impolite to ever refuse a compliment , sir , so .. please , can i hear what you thought ?
here' s my thought , dipshit .
watching you felt like .. a small , intensely powerful wolverine eating a sack o ' nuts out of my anus .
get to my office .
now !
aagh !
ok , mr. osama .
where are you ?
over there ?
ooh !
boom !
colonel jaffe .
now , i may not be a mind reader .. but i think i know what you were gonna say .
you want me to be team captain .
i don' t think i' ve been here long enough to have gained the respect and admiration of the other guys .
but , um ..
what the hell .
i accept .
you know , that' s just a crazy enough idea to actually work .
captain wagstaff .
really ?
so i' m off your shit list ?
no , you puke .
i' ve just spent more than a day and a half trying to mold you into an olympic caliber snowboarder .
i just realized that i' ve been polishing a turd .
you are fuckin ' expelled .
huh .
well , thank you for you support , sir .
who would i see about getting a tuition refund ?
you' re lookin ' at him , scumbucket .
guess what ?
i' m going to impound that homo blowjob slush fund .
all right .
i' m leaving .
ooh .
there' s something i could tell you about last night that would devastate you .
but i got too much class for that .
gossip ?
wait , get back here .
you' re not dismissed !
what they say ?
let' s say that , between you and me , " winter " came a little early last night .
leave it at that .
how dare you ?
i' ve heard that vicious lie from every man on this mountain , and they' re all liars !
get out of here before i kill you with my bare hands !
why , why , why ?
why me ?
oh , god .
jack ?
come to me , jack .
come up now .
now i need you .
ahhh !
i' il be ok ?
i' il be ok ?
i' il be ok !
i' il be ok .
yes , sir !
yes , sir .
this is colonel jaffe .
cadet wagstaffhas just been expelled .
code red .
ohh !
bye bye , billy !
come on , guys .
that' s so you can breathe , wagstaff .
because we are no monsters , you know .
you like hanging out with the poories so much ?
maybe you can show them some of your fancy moves .
i love it when the colonel orders a code red .
just the sound of that body thumping on the inside of that can .
you guys go hit the practice slopes .
i' il be in town fucking the dead guy' s girlfriend .
that' s why him is the captain .
good boy .
ja .
he is one bad fuckermother .
we better go hit the slopes before we end up in can of trash too .
ja .
$500 for your thoughts .
well , i' m still a little mad at billy , but now i' m starting to get worried .
listen , your friend got himself in a lot of trouble before he quit the school .
he stole his tuition money back .
he practically attacked the colonel' s daughter .
and he seemed to be involved in some sort of homosexual men' s room scam .
i' ve known billy my whole life .
that just doesn' t sound like him .
unfortunately , there' s just some people in this world who act nice , but in truth they' re not very nice at all .
have some more wine .
and try not to worry so much .
you' re right .
the one thing i know about billy is that he' s a survivor .
he' s probably out on the beach right now , partying the night away .
oh , sweet savior .
what happened to that billy dude casey came up here with ?
i thought she was all up on his dick .
she is .
it' s one of those things any fool can see but them .
and me .
ok .
that is the last time i take a shit in this can .
oh , shit .
i heard some dude was blowing him in the bathroom last week during that fight we had when the richies kicked our ass .
yeah , that was a good fight .
yeah !
what are you guys so happy about ?
you lost .
they beat you like rugs .
maybe we are giant losers .
i mean , even casey , our muffin girl , is dating a richie .
oh , billy shmilly .
i love schittville .
salt .
a salted road .
i' m on a salted road !
oh , sweet jesus , i' m in the road .
here comes the pain .
brandtsy .
so what is this ?
like , our .. third date ?
fifth .
what the fuck is wrong with that nasty looking and smelly motherfucker ?
if you' re here for more acupuncture , i' m all booked up .
listen , everybody .
i know we got off on the wrong foot , but .. five days duct taped into a trashcan . can change a man .
yeah .
into garbage .
do you mind ?
would you let the motherfucker finish ?
or else he ain' t gonna leave .
thank you .
look ..
we can' t let the richies do this to us anymore .
i admit , when i first got here , i was a jerk .
i was trying to be someone that i' m not .
and i was wrong .
yeah , something most of us learned in the fourth grade , but , please , go on .
well , i learned a couple of things and i wanna share ' em with you .
first , is that a human being can live off the lickings of a garbage can for five .. long .. days .
another thing we learned in the fourth grade .
how about this ?
we don' t have to kowtow to the richies anymore .
question .
kowtow ?
goddamn , they' re stupid motherfuckers .
get pushed around , idiot .
oh !
like the richies do to us .
kowtow !
wait a minute .
we hate kowtowing .
yeah !
i' il cut the next bitch that kowtows me .
the point is , we need to take back what belongs to schittville .
it smells like you done took plenty back already .
i' m talking about the mountain .
and our honor , and our dignity .
honor and dignity ?
that' s some pretty redundant shit for five days ' work .
poopy pants is right .
we need to take back our shit , including casey our muffin girl , unless brandt von hoffman' s kowtowing her right now .
can you use it like that ?
i think you can .
whoa .
wait , wait .
casey is kowtowing brandt ?
why don' t you take me back to my place so we can fuck like wild dogs ?
i can put both my feet behind my head .
check !
but i do have to go put a stop to that right now .
you might want to wash the crap out of your pants first , dear .
she got a helluva an idea , mr. honor and dignity .
ok .
but i still have a good hunk of speech left .
we can' t wait to hear it !
ok .
goddamn !
can somebody crack the window ?
not you , danny , you blind son of a bitch .
case ?
casey ?
oh , thank god .
oh , god .
whoo !
ok , i can' t do this .
what ?
i' m already wearing a rubber .
the colonel says always wear a rubber .
even if you' re just eating with a poorie .
right , i' m really glad you said that incredibly insulting thing .
that' il make this a lot easier .
i' m not gonna have sex with you .
i mean , our going out was a really big mistake .
i like somebody else .
that' s why i moved here in the first place .
what am i supposed to do with this wood ?
build a coffee table ?
ok .
you' re not swaying me much .
i have to ask you to leave .
not until i get what i came for .
billy !
i believe the lady said ..
wow .
what page of national geographic did he pop off of ?
i don' t know .
but i have a feeling you have a lot to do with this .
now , if you don' t leave right now , i' m gonna ..
ohh !
i get it .
i might be rich , but i' m not stupid .
actually , yeah , you are .
bye bye .
here .
give this to your boyfriend .
he can wear it as a wet suit .
he threw a rubber on my face , didn' t he ?
yeah .
let me get it for you .
sorry if i ruined your date .
you did .
but not for the reasons you think .
j. p. hm ?
can i buy you a drink ?
oh , yeah , oh , yeah .
but , uh ..
i don' t have to " follow you to your car " ?
no !
jesus !
i wasn' t with a guy .
i was with the ..
colonel' s daughter .
how did you get at the end of that line ?
i' m still waitin ' for the call .
i feel ..
i feel terrible .
i screwed everybody over and ..
i acted like an asshole .
let me tell you something .
a man who can' t see that he' s acting like a asshole there' s a real asshole .
but a man who can admit it , that man' s all right in my book .
i wrote a book , you know .
give it a skim .
it' s a big .. font .
thank you very much .
i talk all about the kennedys , jimmy hoffa .. space aliens .
that bullshit moon landing .
we never go to no fucking moon .
i bought the commemorative plate for nothing .
i got a whole chapter on the president and his pretty ass wife having dinner with osama bin laden on 9/ 12 .
it' s some heavy shit .
hey , back me up on this .
i taught jim morrison ..
how to boogie woogie one ski in 1989 .
i' m talking heavy shit .
he taught john lennon how to be ironic .
there' s some shit about area 51 .
keep it to yourself .
i' ve been to area 58 .
it' s sort of a rest area .
and here' s one , just between the two of us .
kurt cobain killed that crazy bitch courtney love , cut off his own dick , bought him some titties , and he' s courtney love .
that' s her in his grave .
dig her up and find out .
there' s a hole in that hole .
well , i don' t know about the two of you , but i' m going to sleep .
william ?
are you all right , son ?
j. p. ?
mm hm ?
aren' t you drunk ?
i' ve never been drunk a day in my life .
i' ve been waiting for you , boy .
and no more bullshit between us now .
i' ve seen what you can do up on that mountain .
you are the finest natural born snowboarder ..
i have ever seen in my life .
now , what you got to do is get the respect of this town , and you are not going to do that by walking in with a load of crap in your pants and some dumb ass speech .
how do i get the respect of the town ?
only two men have ever ridden the goat and lived .
and i' il bet everything i wish i had .. that you , billy wagstaff , are gonna be number three .
what if i' m one of the ones who dies ?
well , then , at least you' il make the board .
yeah , baby .
yeah , baby .
hey , guys .
that fuckshit wagstaff , he' s not as dead as we' d hoped .
and here is the kicker .
the goat he is going to ride now .
let' s go .
ja .
but i thought we were gonna have sex .
who wants sex when you can watch wagstiff trying to kill himself riding the goat ?
no brainer .
let' s go watch that bastard break his neck .
hey , you guys .
you' re not gonna believe this .
i just heard billy wagstaff is skiing the goat .
look .

go , go , billy .
go , go !
you' il never see the other side of goat' s hump .
die , you sucker .
oh , fuck !
shit , i' m alive !
oh , shit .
i can' t believe that bastard wagstiff boarded the goat .
maybe one of us should ski the goat .
yeah .
brandt should do it .
he' s the team captain .
no way .
nootnik , you do it .
sven , it is your idea .
you do it .
no .

make hans do it .
why me ?

schlomo can' t do it .
you must do it .
no , you do it .
no , you do it .
you do it , hans .
no , you do it .
no , you do it .
you do it .
you do it .
doesn' t anyone want to do me ?
you do it .
here' s to billy " who the man " wagstaff , who boarded the goat and gave us poories a hero .
we love you , brah .
billy , billy .
now would be the right time for that speech , which is funny , yet motivates us to become better people .
yeah !
yes , thank you , j. p.
wow .
i guess i' d just like to say that when i was trapped in the trash , the one thing that kept me going was knowing that all of schittville was out there looking for me .
yeah ..
huh .
yeah .
i did learn what i valued most in life , and that is friends .. freedom .. and , of course , food and air .
and the right to board where we want to board .
yeah .
right on , brother .
damn , this is some speech .
so let' s raise a glass , you guys .
to a new era on pine mountain .
and let' s end this ridiculous distinction between richies and poories and let' s make this a place where every single person is welcome and accepted .
yeah .
and get those assholes outta here .
they put me in a garbage can and left me to die .
i wanna talk to you , wagstaff .
your days on the mountain are over , old man .
billy boarded the goat .
you know the rules .
i know the law of the mountain .
i know that any team can challenge any other team to a chinese downhill , no holds barred race to the bottom for total domination of pine mountain , and i say you poories haven' t got the guts .
hell , yeah .
yeah .
all right , gentlemen .
listen up .
there' s absolutely no way in hell you can lose this race if you board good and hard .
now , there' s a lot at risk here , so i' m leaving nothing to chance .
step up and grab a piece of insurance .
ja !
but , colonel , why do we need the medieval weapons or clubs of death ?
because we' re not taking a chance .
he just explained this , you stupid australian .
but i am hungarian .
well , if you' re so hungry , eat me .
ja !
ja !
all right , the winners rule the mountain .
the losers .. don' t rule the mountain .
you just said the same damn thing twice , you redundant talking , big truck driving , one ski boogie woogie idea stealing , ho raising , dumb signposting motherfucker .
yeah !
why don' t you have another beer , you adjective throwing ,
will smith loving , lie telling , big book writing that ain' t nobody ever gonna read idiot ?
yeah !
there' s some heavy shit in there .
you really ought to give it a skim .
look , i think we all knowwhat' s at stake and that j. p. wrote a book with some very heavy shit in it .
now , please , can we just race ?
who' s gonna say " go , " brah ?
who' s not boarding ?
gee , i wonder who everybody' s looking at .
come on , honey .
this way .
i know you hate me , billy , but , really , good luck .
thank you , winter .
you can watch my butt .
come on .
hang on to your jewels .
hey , j. p. ! .
you' re sure easy to see in the show .
kiss my black ass , you crazy white devil .
look who it is billy' s little slut girlfriend .
i hate you .
you fucking bitch !
whoo !
whoo !
whoo !
damn you , wagstaff .
you know i love you , don' t you ?
yeah .
yeah ?
naomi , what i' m asking you is .. if you' d be my seeing eye wife .
yes , danny .
because even though you can' t see my mind boggling beauty on the outside , you can see my mind boggling beauty on the inside .
i' m the happiest guy in the world .
danny , honey , you' re kissing a dead beaver .
i don' t care .
i love you anyway .
that beaver' s not dead .
that is one lucky , no seeing , beaver licking ,
naomi hugging son of a gun .
hey , brahs , the colonel , winter and the richies are here .
this is a private party , you no contest winning motherfuckers .
but that fine daughter of yours , she can stay .
but you other tight ass bitches , get the fuck out of here .
actually , we' re just here to say goodbye , because you poories have ruined snowboarding for us .
so we' re taking our olympic skills elsewhere because i' ve invented a new sport .
it' s called one board boatless water skiing .
that' s surfing , motherfucker .
africans invented that shit trying to get off your goddamn slave ships by hanging on to pieces of driftwood headed for the motherland .
it' s in the book , fool .
give it a skim .
oh , skim that book high and hard , supertan .
you know , i think the important thing is here that you' re leaving .
no , billy .
the important thing is ..
this is leaving , ok ?
wrap it up .
and you poorie chicks are gonna be missing out on this .
oh , who are we fooling ?
we poories should be fighting with the richies .
it' s what we do .
whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa !
stop , you guys .
why do the richies and poories always have to be fighting each other ?
why can' t we just make schittville the example for the whole world ?
all right , gentlemen .
greener pastures .
hold on one second , guys .
you' re lucky we' re leaving , wagstiff .
if we weren' t , i don' t think it would be too long before little casey here starts begging for a piece of what' s in this package .
goddamn , some more heavy shit for my book .
give it a skim .
roll cameras .
cue marker .
hey , brandt .
i' m counting on you to hold me there , boss .
keep rolling .
that fucking hurt my leg .
still rolling ?
still rolling .
great .
thank you .
do it two times .
marker .
oh , god !
that beaver' s not dead .
what happened to my chair ?
yes , i just hurt my ass .
oh , my god .
your lips say no .
i' m billy wagstaff .
what the fuck is wrong with that nasty smelling and looking motherfucker ?
sorry .
it' s billy wagstaff .
what the fuck is wrong with that nasty looking and smelly motherfucker ?
but i got a really good hunk of speech left .
what was that ?
well , good .
i' m happy .
i like " nazi fag . " good line .
blow me .
hot stuff .
i bet i could hear that if i tried , and maybe a little labia flapping kind of action .
i mean , you know , i felt her face .
she' s a good looking girl , and , you know , come to think of it ,
i wouldn' t mind putting my mouth right .. if i could get a mouthful of that camel toe .
all that about labias flapping and camel toeing and shit .
white people .
you wouldn' t know anything about that , would you ..
colonel ?
hey , kate .
listen , i' m not an educated man , and i wouldn' t know strasberg from stanislavski , but i thought that was a little on the indicate y side .
hey , kate .
if overacting was sexy , i' d be hard as a fucking rock right now .
hey , kate .
william shatner just called .
he wants his acting style back .
oh , god , forgive me .
what do you know ?
wait .
i' m going to hell .
i' m going directly to hell .
well , there you go , boys .
it' s all true what they told you .
damn , look at the bucket of junk sticking out of those pants .
thank you , thank you .
good to see you .
i love you ..
good to see you .
good ..
doggone , doggone .
you really , really , really know how to make a fella feel welcome .
and as i scan the crowd here , i see a few new faces .
and if any of you don' t know me ,
i am jack schitt .. the third .
we love you , jack !
i love you too , man !
somebody get a video camera .
a what ?
oh , yeah .
i guess we' re just gonna have to use our rememberers .
your rememberers ?
oh , lord .
we truly are in the town that time forgot .
they say his house is so opulent , he has his own driveway .
i would too if i made jack schitt money .
now , very rarely do i get a chance to interface with the youth of the community .
i thought this was a prime opportunity .
the first nugget of wisdom i need to share with you is to stay off the doggone drugs .
even pot ?
oh , no , no , no .
pot' s ok .
that' s medicinal .
i' m talking the hard stuff .
what about cocaine ?
no , no , no .
i got no problem with cocaine .
i mean , as a matter of fact ,
i' ve been known to do a bump or two in the morning to get me out of bed .
i am talkin ' the hard drugs .
ecstasy ?
ecstasy .. is a tool .
it' s not a drug .
as a matter of fact , i got a belly full of it right now !
now , drugs is just a minor part of the problem .
the big thing i want you to remember , for the love of mike , is to stay in school .
i' m 31 .
school' s not really an option for me .
jack schitt is a straight shooter .
and if you' re over 30 , and you' re havin ' trouble with the readin ' and writin ' ,
i' m not gonna tell you that' s a plus .
mr. schitt , is anything about us a plus ?
i' il see y' all at the schittville holiday parade .
thank you very much !
thank you !
love you .
i love you , man .
i love you !
i love you .
man , they sure could use a man like that in washington .
that big talkin ' , corny dressin ' , out of style , bolo tie wearin ' motherfucker .
i hate that motherfucker .
