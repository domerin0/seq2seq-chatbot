you were right .
this is definitely better than being at work .
one thing you didn' t warn us about though bloody midges .
you big girl' s blouse ! .
anyway , now that you' ve mentioned work ... ... and seeing as i bullied you to come here to celebrate ...
here .
congratulations .
no knight should be without his sword .
i don' t know what to say .
what , my writer lost for words ? .
it' s perfect .
yeah , and it' s also solid silver so don' t lose it !
nice try , private cooper .
you' ve evaded capture for twenty two hours ... ... and forty seven minutes .
go straight to the head of the class .
of course , the real trick to survival ... ... lies not in running and hiding ... ... but in removing your enemy' s capacity to hunt you down .
here .
shoot the dog .
i' m sorry , sir , what ? .
take the weapon and use it .
during the selection process , you are under my command !
that' s a direct order , cooper !
you' re taking the piss , right ? .
he thinks i am pulling his ieg .
do i iook iike a sodding soldier comedian , shitwipe ? . !
no , sir !
i still won' t do it .
you don' t have a choice .
finish the job .
shoot the dog .
shoot it !
no , sir !
what use are you to my team ... ... if you can' t even kill a dog ? .
i didn' t say i couldn' t kill a dog , sir .
i just will not kill that dog for no reason .
you' re binned , cooper .
i don' t need a man of conscience .
you' re failing me for this ? .
you failed yourself !
we' re on a different level here , cooper .
for that ...
i need men of action ... ... not deeds .
no !
you sick fucking bastard !
it' s just a dog .
that' s all .
maybe one day when that' s sunk into your thick skull ... ... you' il be ready for us .
until then , you live and learn .
yeah , but you don' t .
i don' t do second chances , cooper .
and i never forget .
rtu this pathetic piece of shit .
send him back to his squad .
i want a good , clean dispersal .
i want a secure landing zone .
go , go , go , go , go !
joe , get out of the pissing chopper !
i' m not missing the footy for this , it' s totally bone !
i' m not going , sarge .
i' m not going !
see you .
cooper ...
i want a position and bearing .
i want to be on the move in three minutes .
on it , sarge .
spoon , terry , you' re on stag .
joe , for fuck sake ... ... get off your big , fat , iardy arse and make like a soldier !
right then time sync .
i' ve got zero seven thirty coming up in ... ... three , two , one , check .
oh bullocks , i don' t believe this !
what is it now , witherspoon ? .
i' ve left my watch at the barracks , sarge .
you want to take a breather every once in a while , son , you' il live longer .
nice work , spoon , you tosser .
took the words right out of my mouth .
and you' il be taking my boot out your mouth in a minute , joe , you baldy twat !
pissing hell !
close shave, eh joe ? .
oh , this shit is totally bone !
the most important football match of my life is playing tonight ... ... and i' m stuck up the backside of beyond without so much as ... ... a six pack or a telly !
yeah , well , that' s the army for you .
hey , it' s england v germany , man .
full on footy war !
yeah , well , it' s nothing iike this at all then , is it joe ? .
it' s just an exercise .
hardly life or death .
don' t bet on it , joe , you' re fucking slaying me !
if you' d paid any attention at all during the briefing , kirkley ... ... you' d know exactly who we were up against on this harmless little exercise , wouldn' t you ? .
and who' s that then ? .
special forces , you plonker !
bollocks to them !
all right , all right .
now iisten up , i' m gonna make this quick and to the point ... ... because , just iike you , all i wanna do is get home ... ... jump into a warm bed with a nice hot woman and watch the footy !
planning on scoring , sarge ? .
yeah , well , mind you don' t foui her in the penalty box .
all right , button it , private parts !
now , as of this moment as far as we' re concerned , we are fifty ' k ' behind enemy lines .
now , if we do happen to make a contact ... ...
i expect nothing iess than gratuitous violence from the lot of you .
because we' re firing blanks it doesn' t mean we have to be thinking ... nice thoughts .
so you remember you put the fire down , right ? .
you get stuck in and you kick their fucking teeth out ... ... or i' il guarantee you , joe , they will be having your bollocks for breakfast , sunshine !
hard boiled or fried , sarge ? .
scrambled .
here you are , spoonie .
oh , smart .
because it' s nice and new and shiny doesn' t mean it' s worth shit .
remember i want that back , son .
what about you , sarge ? .
well , i' il count , won' t l ? .
right then , coop , what we got ? .
we' re here .
the front line is here .
awac reports enemy positions here , here and here .
with sweeping patrols between each of these forward bunkers ... ... they' il have the whole sector wrapped tighter than an eskimo' s nad sack .
with one exception .
right here .
a river crosses the line through a gorge thirty or forty feet deep ... ... and it' s certain to have a patroi on it , but if we go at night ... ... tread careful and don' t mind getting our feet wet ... ...
i reckon we can make it through .
what the fuck is all this about then ? .
oh , with my iuck iately , i need all of the help i can get .
i know you think it was a piss poor call , you failing selection and all of that , but ... ...
i gotta say , i' m not sorry .
the squad would be a iot worse off without you , mate .
it was something i had to do , you know .
for myself , get it out my system .
listen , the only people who go iooking for trouble are kamikazes ... ... glory boys and full on fucking fuckwits !
take my advice son , be patient .
right then , ladies ... ... pack up your troubles ... ... put your brains in first gear and start tabbing !
spoonie , you' re on point .
terry , joe , tail end charlies .
over here , cooper , on my head .
you twatter !
i can' t believe i' m missing the footy for this party !
joe , if you don' t shut up , i swear to god i' m gonna fucking slot you myself !
now move ! .
didn' t say a word , sarge .
where the hell are we now ? .
i heard a cracking story about this place .
you what ? .
people disappear out here .
happens all the time .
go on , cooper , lad , give it some boolocks .
it' s true .
just iast month a young couple were hiking through these woods .
they set up camp somewhere near here .
during the night something happened .
a mountain rescue team found the remains of the camp a couple of days alter .
the tent was ripped to shreds and there was blood everywhere !
the papers said it was a monster like the beast of bodmin moor .
locals claimed it was an escaped lunatic .
but no one' s been caught so nothing can be proved either way .
every year more and more people come through here ... ... and every one in a while they don' t come back .
no trace , no bodies just disappear ... ... and never seen again .
contact camp .
tell them the flock is heading for the fold .
broadsword to base .
come on then , bruce , what scares you ? .
the self destructive nature of the human condition .
you' re just taking the piss now !
what , you think so ? .
what about you then , spoon ? .
castration .
there' s no argument there .
joe ? .
joe , only one thing guaranteed to put the shits up me .
a penalty shoot out .
figures .
terry ? .
watching a penalty shoot out with joe .
what about you , coop ? .
spiders and women .
and spider women .
i want to know what scares the sarge .
piss off , man , nothing scares the sarge !
oh , i don' t know about that .
well , the thought of never seeing my wife again scares the shit out of me !
that and those iittle things that make your skin crawl ... ... and the hair stand up on the back of your neck .
you mean like spoon ? .
no , there' s one thing actually , in particular ... ... that i' il remember till the day that i die .
yeah , it was back in ninety one , just before my unit was flown out to kuwait ... ... to mop up the last pockets of resistance .
me and this young fella called eddie oswald ... ... decided to go and get a tattoo done ... ... to commemorate our first trip into the desert .
yeah , i remember eddie .
he was a stocky hard case ... ... with a broken nose and a bong eye , yeah ? .
yeah , that' s him .
good iooking fella .
big hit with the ladies .
anyway , me and eddie , we went and had a few drinks ... ... we had a lot of drinks ... ... then we went down to the tattoo parlour and i got a deser rat done ... ... and eddie being eddie wanted something with a bit more meaning .
and being a bit of a believer ... ... he said that his soul still belonged to god ... ... but his flesh , well , his flesh was way beyond redemption ... ... and it was up to satan to save his skin .
so he got this fucking great iaughing devii tattooed right on his arse .
anyway , about six days iater we were making a regular sweep along the lraqi border ... ... and eddie , poor fucker , triggered an anti tank mine .
yeah .
we all saw it happen .
i mean , he was on point .
white blinding lightning flash and a fucking deafening crack .
and by the time we picked ourselves up off the deck , eddie was ... ... he was gone .
just bits and pieces of him .
that' s all that remained .
this big fucking red circle .
hundred metres .
i' il tell you something , iads , it really puts things in perspective ... ... when you have to scoop your mate up with a shovel and stick him in a bin bag .
anyway , the thing that ... ... really did our nuts in that day was when you ... ... came across a bit you recognised .
bit of ear toe , a nose , a tooth .
but the thing that really freaked us out that day ... ... was when left hand charlie found the bit of eddie with the tattoo on .
i mean everything else was burnt to a crisp , covered in claret .
all mushed up , pulped up .
not this bit .
this bit was perfect .
and there' s old nick chortling his fucking arsehole off at us !
so you could say that eddie was right ... ... that satan did indeed save his skin , just not all of it .
or you could say that eddie was just unlucky .
either way it taught me to keep a very open mind .
boom boom .
anyway ...
eddie oswald .
to eddie .
to eddie .
so , anyway , this bloke walks into a pub , right ... ... with a little dog under his arm .
he puts it down on the bar , goes and sits down .
the bartender' s looking at him thinking
what the fucking hell' s going on here ?? " .
then he looks back at the dog and , to his surprise , the dog turns round and says ...
it' s a fucking cow !
fucking hell !
ceasefire , terry , ceasefire .
terry , what the hell are you doing ? .
you' re firing blanks , man !
is everyone all right ? .
no man , i think i' ve shit myself !
is it dead ? .
oh yeah , it' s dead all right .
christ , iook at the state of it !
sod that , man , look at the state of terry .
these aren' t entry wounds more like teeth marks .
what are you saying , cooper ? .
what he' s saying , terry , is it died of natural causes , mate .
don' t you think we should call this in , sarge ? .
aye , get on the radio , bruce .
now there' s no way i' m about to break radio silence ... ... because you iot got spooked by a dead flying fucking cow !
no , we hold this position .
we keep it secure till the morning ... ... then we reassess the situation .
right , i want a watch posted .
two on , four off .
brucie , spoon , you' re up first .
cooper and i will relieve you at zero one hundred hours .
and in meantime terry sort your kit out !
the rest of you get your heads down .
unbelievable .
sarge ... cow came in from this direction ... ... straight off the edge .
out of the frying pan on to the fire .
bleeding to death it could have wandered around for miles before it got here .
yeah , well , it' s good of it to ieave some breadcrumbs for us to follow , eh ? .
looking for trouble ? .
no , cooper just looking .
sarge , shouldn' t we just report this when we get back ? .
too fucking right , terry .
but in the meantime ,
i' m curious and it' s on our way .
come on , lads .
natural causes , my arse .
oh , now what ? .
christ on a bike !
what the fucking hell happened here , sarge ? .
this is getting more bone by the minute !
oh , jesus christ .
sarge !
right , lads get a grip .
we' ve got casualties to locate .
so , ditch your bergens , salvage whatever weapons you can find ... ... and stand to .
we are now up against live hostile targets .
so if little red riding hood should show up with a bazooka and a bad attitude ... ...
i expect you to chin the bitch !
looks iike they got hit hard and fast .
every magazine is full .
nobody got off a single round .
if they lost , then where are the bodies ? .
all right , corporal ... ... get on the net and call in .
i want emergency airlift immediately !
i' m on it .
holy shit !
contact !
help me !
captain !
ryan ? . !
what happened here ? .
do not tell me you fucking know him ? .
captain ryan .
special ops .
not the fucking dog lover ? .
spearhead patrol , this is spearhead patrol .
are you receiving ? .
he iooks iike he took on jack the ripper and came last !
i can patch him up but he needs a medic right now !
this is emergency code 64 .
you' ve gotta get me out of here !
do you understand ? .
there was only supposed to be one !
we' re working on it , captain !
sarge .
not now , spoon .
are you receiving ? .
shit .
what' s wrong , bruce ? .
i can' t find a signal !
didn' t you check it ? .
of course i checked it !
and i double checked it and it worked fine !
all right , bruce , stay on it , see what you can do .
terry ... ... this team must have had their own coms kit .
have a look a round , see if you can find it .
go ! ... have a shufti round the camp , see if you can find anything else useful .
yah , but ...
not now , spoon !
this is spearhead patrol .
are you receiving me ? .
there' s only supposed to be one !
jesus !
charnel house is compromised to fuck !
do you copy ? .
what the hell' s he doing here ? .
all i know is he' s special forces .
but if this is part of our exercise , they' re not advertising .
no cap badge , no insignia , just tags .
what , you mean it' s some kind of convert action ? .
convert action or not , they' re packing all kind of weird shit !
tranquillizer darts , nets ... ... you name it .
this is less like a special ops mission ... ... more like a fucking safari .
sarge , i found their radio .
oh shit !
i don' t believe it !
there was only supposed to be one !
what' s he on about , sarge ? .
terry , get back on stag now .
you' ve got to get me out of here before they come back !
who , captain ? .
who is going to come back ? .
they tore them to pieces in front of my eyes !
he' s off on one , sarge !
if we don' t get him somewhere warm soon , he' s gonna die of hypothermia !
stay with me , captain .
ryan , stay with me !
not now , spoon !
i don' t know if you care but in about half an hour it' s gonna be dark .
does anybody copy ? .
any joy ? .
fuses are blown .
can you fix it ? .
well , maybe it was faulty or maybe some damp got in the casing , but it' s fried the circuits .
well ... ... it' s useless , mate , bin it .
i also found this .
it was attached inside .
not part of the radio .
look like a transmitter .
why would they put a bug in our radio ? . it' s the kobayashi maru test .
they' ve fixed it so we can' t fucking win !
button it , spoon !
no , terry , it' s probably some joker didn' t want .
joe to hear the footy results .
laugh ? .
i nearly shat !
can we scrounge anything useful ? .
weapons , ammunition ... ... couple of magnesium flares .
that' s about it .
the rest' s fucked !
right , iads ditch your 80s .
from here on in the exercise is well and truly over .
anyone not carrying iive rounds had better do so .
it won' t make any difference .
they won' t die .
yeah , well ...
.. this gives me better peace of mind , sir .
you want peace of mind ... ... run for your iives before they tear your iegs from under you !
now you just shut up like a good gentleman !
you are scaring my lads .
what the fuck ... !
oh christ !
oh , shit !
all right , lads grab what you can ... ... head for the tree line .
we' re moving .
let' s go .

we were attacked by huge fucking howling things !

you were lucky i found you .
i was about to give up hope .

i heard gunfire last night .
i knew someone was out there .
if you weren' t already in trouble , then you soon would be .
we are two men are down .
both need medical attention .
we need to dress the sarge' s wounds before we can take him too far .
there' s only one farm in this glen , but ... ... the owner are friends .

spoon , get a field dressing on that wound .
terry , keep an eye out front .
come on .

you can' t just help yourself !
i' m chin strap and i' m bloody starving .
i can' t help myself .
it' s the training , miss .
never waste an opportunity to eat .
come on .

top grub .
what is it ? .

looks like pork .
yeah , well , ieave some for us , you greedy mongrels !
miss , where is the nearest phone ? .
fifty miles as the crows flies .
what about the nearest population centre ? .
you mean a town ? .
well , fort william but it' s at ieast four hour drive back the way we just came .
do you think your wounded can make it ? .
we have to try .
the sarge is in serious trouble if we don' t .
you seem to know these roads .
will you take us ? .
right now ? .
well , unless you friends have just gone walkabout , this place may be compromised .
fine .
sooner the better .
let' s go .
right .
spoon , on me .
everyone else , hang back till we bring the car about .
joe , help sarge .
terry , watch him .
safeties off .
don' t shoot .
don' t stare back .
i can' t help it .
go !
come on !
cooper , have you gone spare or what ? .
cooper , you radgie !
that puts the kibosh on that plan !
that was my car !
give us a fucking hand here !
oh my god !
fuck off !
fuck that !
stand back !
bloody hell !
go on , son !
what the fucking hell' s happening ? .
terry , right flank .
cover the window !
for christ' s sake , terry , man , get a grip !
that' s bloody charming , that is !
you incompetent moron !
do you want to have a fucking go , like ? . !
bathroom ? .
upstairs .
far end of passage .
we need to talk , ryan .
doesn' t look like i' m going anywhere , does it ? . !
joe , spoon , look like we' re staying .
you know what to do .
i want a secure perimeter with a clear field of fire .
but give them something inviting .
right ? .
i' m on it .
terry , are you okay ? .
i' ve got a reai craving for a kebab .
i' il take that as a yes .
right , we' ve got limited ammunition .
i want you to get as many pots and pans as you can lay your hands on ... ... fill them with water and keep them on the boil , all right ? .
terry ... ... while you' re at it , stick the kettle on .
we could all do with a brew .
terry give us a hand with this .
other side .
other side .
ah , you fool !
you came here because of them , right ? .
i don' t have a fucking clue what ' they ' are .
and right now , i don' t really care .
then what are you doing here ? .
this was supposed to be a routine training exercise and that' s all .
so this wasn' t a rescue mission ? .
no , i guess not .
back door' s secure .
what' s happening here , spoon ? .
well , they' re still moving around our there ... ... but they' re keeping their distance , staying within the tree line .
maybe they' ve had enough for one night .
not likely .
they' re smart .
you' ve seen what they can do .
my guess ... ... is they' re doing exactly what you' d be doing in their shoes .
they' re working as a team .
looking for a weakness , a way in .
i' m not about to second guess these things .
they' re enemy , simple as that .
this is no ordinary enemy .
you know what this reminds me of ? .
rourke' s drift .
a hundred men of harlech making a desperate stand ... ... against ten thousand zulu warriors .
outnumbered , surrounded ... ... staring death in the face , not flinching for a moment .
balls of british steel .
you' re bloody loving this , aren' t you ? .
it' s totally bone that' s all there is to say .
so , what are we talking about here , wolves ? .
not entirely wolf .
not all human , but something in between .
wolfmen ? .
you' re having a laugh , right ? .
i may be nuts but i' m not fruitcake !
fine .
stay here and drink tea !
i thought you might be here because of them , but i guess not .
just don' t be an arsehole !
i like your new girlfriend , coop .
how are you feeling ? .
a touch of gas .
and the fact that various body parts are trying to vacate the premises ... ... fucking awful !
it' s hot .
cheers .
heads up !
for crying out loud , man !
short controlled bursts !
do you have a name , soldier ? .
cooper .
gonna need your help here , miss .
my name is megan .
and i know how to kill them .
shit , sarge , you' re leaking like a sieve !
look , i need you to get some superglue and some whisky , all right ? .
i' il see what i can do .
come on .
no , no , no ... sorry about the arsehole thing .
i' ve got a mean streak a mile across .
that' s all right .
it' s the ieast of my worries right now .
can you pass me my gun , please ? .
thank you .
come on , coop , up the wooden hill .
where are we going , coop ? .
you don' t wish to know , mate .
what' s the glue for ? .
ever wondered why the best thing that superglue sticks together is your fingers ? .
fucking get off !
give it .
give it .
forget your grandma' s china cups ... ... this stuff was developed for the vietnam war to patch up broken soldiers .
how are you feeling , sarge ? .
absolutely fucking top fucking bollocks !
are you sure he should be chasing painkillers with whisky ? .
yeah , well , he' s earned it .
is it your birthday , coop ? .
no , mate .
is it my birthday ? .
no , but you' re gonna thank us for this in the morning .
i' il tell you something , mate ,
i' m gonna fucking thank you right now .
i' m gonna thank you because you saved my iife .
you got me out of there , mate .
yeah , well , you would have done the same thing .
if i' d done the same fucking thing ,
i would have saved bruce wouldn' t l ? .
yeah , fuck !
sausages !
i' il tell you something , miss , right ... ... this geezer here , right , is my best mate .
he' s the salt of the fucking earth .
i mean , don' t get me wrong , the rest of the geezers in the squad , they' re all right ,
lovely fellas and stuff ... ... and any single one of them could marry my ... ... marry my sister if i had one .
i' il tell you what , i love him .
i love you ... ... like a mate that i ... that i love .
would you like to be alone ? .
oh , you dirty fucker !
here .
it' s the adrenaline .
i' il stick , you bond .
i' il tell you something , someone better get fucking stuck in soon ... ... because this is really starting to hurt !
what' s up ? .
cooper , knock me out .
hit me !
oh you fucking pussy , hit me ...
go , go .
so , how iong have you iived round here ? .
two years .
came here for wildlife .
i' m a zoologist .
so , you' ve heard those stories as well then .
yeah , i heard the stories , i went iooking , i found evidence .
i was fascinated by the possibility that ...
you can' t seriously believe in werewolves ? .
straight out of college , i' d have iaughed at the suggestion , but now ... ...
i know they' re as real as you and me .
before tonight is over , you will too .
there i think that will hold .
you done this before ? .
oh , yeah .
we glue people' s gut together all the time out here .
everyone tooled up ? .
to the nines .
you' il have a fucking eye out with that , lad .
right , terry , look sharp !
the rest of you ... ...
i know things have gone from shit to bone ... ... to worse in the last twenty four hours , but ... ... if we pull our weight and do the job ... ... we still have a fighting chance .
no more running .
we stand , here .
we fight .
right ? .
any questions ? .
oh , just the one , coop .
exactly what is it we' re fighting against ? .
megan ? .
you want to run it past the boys ? .
lycanthropes .
you what ? .
that' s werewolves to you and me .
you' re taking the piss ? .
what ? .
makes perfect sense to me !
what , you mean like full moons , silver bullets and eyebrows that join in the middle ? .
before you dismiss it offhand , think about what you' ve seen and heard .
the full moon , the teeth ... ... the claws , the howling .
is it so difficult to believe ? .
for a whole year now ... ...
i' ve tracked these things .
i' ve studied them .
tried to understand them .
ever month , when the moon is full ... ... they hunt as a team .
dedicated to the kill .
during that time , at ieast fifteen people have vanished .
hikers mostly .
in small groups or alone .
they' re caught out in the open , hunted down , torn apart and devoured .
i' ve never witness the actuai slaughter , but the next day ... ... no bodies , no werewolves just blood .
the eyebrow' s thing is nonsense .
it' s just dark age paranoia .
and silver bullets ... ... no one' s ever get close enough to try .
i' m sold .
slow down , spoon , but megan may have a point .
i' m still not convinced that these things didn' t just escape from the local nuthouse ... ... and forget to shave or trim their nails .
but they' re out there and we' re in here .
what they may or may not be ... ... does not affect our immediate situation one bit .
this is bone .
this is so fucking bone !
anything else ? .
yeah , what does bone mean ? .
bone bollocks .
naff .
not very good .
right .
anything else i should know ? .
call signs .
if you need to be specific .
upstairs , you' ve got sergeant wells who you seem to know inside and out by now .
you' ve got spoon over there .
the vomiting cavalier , terry .
the big guy with the axe is joe .
didn' t you forget someone ? .
ryan .
captain ryan is not one of our team .
his being here is hazy at best .
if i could tell you , i would .
but i' m just a soldier like you .
no stripes no insignia .
a suit in a uniform does not make a soldier .
he' s with special ops .
his team were wiped out iast night .
he was the only survivor .
i' d advise you against pursuing this line of questioning , private cooper .
are you pulling ranks on me now , captain ? .
you can shove that right up your arse !
i' m saying my being here is a most point ... ... since i' m now in as much shit as you are .
we' re all in the same fucking shit .
and we need each other .
i doubt i need you .
you bloody did two hours ago !
the uaths .
crying like a baby , you were .
that was then .
circumstances change .
what ? .
uath it' s celtic .
the family has lived in this glen for centuries .
so , what was he doing out there ? .
i have an idea .
but i want to hear it from the horse' s mouth .
come to think of it , ryan , how are you feeling ? .
i' m fine .
when we found you , you could barely open your eyes , let alone walk ... ... and then later , you managed to run ... ... and now iook at you fighting fit and sitting pretty .
hardly the behaviour of a man who ... ... until recently , was knocking on death' s door .
i have a strong constitution .
you' re not bloody kidding !
then you won' t mind if i have a iook at that wound of yours .
i' d just as soon you didn' t .
i have a responsibility to my patient .
i' m warning you , cooper , don' t touch me !
get back !
tie him up .
i want him to talk .
what are you gonna do , torture him ? .
don' t know .
what would you do ? .
i' d torture him .
what now ? . !
they' ve shut down the generator .
why would they do that ? .
because they can see in the dark .
and you' re afraid of it .
this is a pile of rancid shit !
now what do you believe ? .
i' m beginning to believe you , but i think joe might have worded it better .
they' re on the move !
all right this is it !
mark your targets and preserve your ammo .
three round bursts .
we' ve only got one stun grenade apiece ... ... so only use them if absolutely necessary .
stand to .
come on then .
what can i do ? .
what do you want to do ? .
run and hide .
i know what' s coming .
take care of sam .
keep an eye on ryan .
if he tries anything , pan him .
chasing that first kiss , are we , cooper ? .
it' s as simple as this .
if you' re not there for us ... ... we' re not here for you .
contact !
die !
spoon , get down !
fucking back !
fuck !
fire in the hole !
cooper ! ...
hurry !
cheers , mate .
sarge .
cooper !
sarge ! ...
sarge !
bastard !
sarge , wake up !
fucking wake up , you bastard !
sarge !
say ' cheese ' , you fucker !
wake up !
fuck !
sarge !
dogs ? .
more like pussies !
you all right ? .
oh , yeah , yeah , i' m peachy , mate .
coop ... squad' s yours , mate .
they took terry .
then we go and get him back !
too fucking right !
forget about him .
what did you say ? .
he' s dead , cooper , and you know it .
shit !
somebody must have heard some gunfire !
somebody must have heard something !
who ? .
the only other house within fifty miles of here is mine .
and l ' , not there !
well , what about the road , man ? .
passers by ? .
do you have any idea what kind of luck you had running into me out there tonight ? .
i thought you ran into us ? .
joe , check upstairs .
even if anyone did come by , they would only end up ... ... lambs for the slaughter like you .
our only hope is daylight .
the sun rises in six hours .
we did the best we could .
but if the sarge' s condition deteriorates ... ... he' il have less than four .
and the only thing holding them back ... ... is they don' t know how much ammunition we have left .
let' s have a look at that .
tell me .
honestly , what are our chances ? .
morale seems good , considering .
but that will only last as long as the ammunition holds out .
high spirits are just no substitute of eight hundred rounds a minute ... ... but i don' t think that' s what you wanted to hear .
think about it , cooper up until today ... ... you believe there was a iine between myth and reality .
may have been a very fine line sometimes , but at least there was a line .
those things out there are real .
and if they' re real , what else is real ? .
you know what lives in the shadows now .
you may never get another night' s sleep as long as you live .
so , why worry , cooper ? .
you may not live that long .
shut your mouth !
we are gonna make it through this .
you know why ? .
i don' t scare that easy .
here .
it' s supposed to be lucky .
for me , or the rest of the rabbit ? .
you' il need a lot more than luck this time .
shut up , ryan !
listen to me , cooper ... ... ignore him .
we can survive till sunrise .
that' s all that matters .
it' s just a few more hours .
wait a minute .
am i missing something here ? .
i know him .
i was seconded to his team during their first visit here .
first visit ? .
what first visit ? .
what the fuck are you talking about ? .
they came to check out the stories .
they needed an expert .
it' s just a few more hours , cooper .
that' s all it is .
all clear ? .
yeah .
you wanna kill them all ? .
yes .
good .
keep it up .
what' s the damage , spoon ? .
well , we might have pissed on our chips .
we' ve only got two full mags for mp5s ... ... six rounds for the shotgun ... ... and one spare , just in case .
stay sharp , everyone .
we were putting fire down all over .
i mean , we filled those things with iead and they just kept on getting up and coming back at us .
sixty rounds , man , ain' t gonna last two minutes .
so , either we all make a break for it and fight our way clear or ... ... or the rest of us keep them occupied while one of us goes for help .
and by the time the cavalry get here ... ... they' il have to pick what' s ieft of us from between their fucking teeth !
fucking brilliant !
we either stay and snuff it or we all go and snuff it !
decisions , decisions .
laugh ? .
i nearly died .
who' s stopping you ? .
right , that' s it !
we' il fucking have him !
take it easy , big man .
calm down .
do any of you know how to hot wire a car ? .
what ? .
they keep an old land rover in the barn .
i don' t know where the keys are ... ... but if one of you could break in and start it , then ...
i can do that .
are you sure ? .
piece of piss !
anyway , the further i am from this wanker , the happier i' il be .
all right you' re gonna need a decoy .
something fast and loud .
what ? .
you what ? .
you sit .
stay .
you' re serious about this werewolf thing , aren' t you ? .
i' m afraid so .
shit .
don' t suppose you know who won the match .
didn' t even know there was a game on .
it' s not a game .
right , this is it .
everyone get ready .
bollocks .
joe good luck , mate .
you don' t get off the hook that easy .
all right , you bastards ... ... come and have a go if you think you' re hard enough !
well , come on , you beauties !
they took the bait !
come on !
spoon , run !
move your fucking arse , soldier !
come on !
i' m trying !
pull us !
i love it when a posh bird talks dirty !
jesus !
fucking what' s happening , cooper ? . !
fucking cut it !
get back !
cut it !
cut it !
fucking thing !
cut it !
shit !
he' s done it !
ryan , up !
everyone else , downstairs .
come on , move it !
come on !
all right , coop !
move .
move .
you' re behind me , aren' t you ? .
i' m gonna fucking have you !
come on .
ready ? .
go , go !
back !
well ? .
she' s in a bad way .
fuel pump' s gone ... ... fan belt' s buggered and she' s pissing out petrol like there' s no tomorrow .
the word ' bone ' springs to mind .
joe' s body ? .
it' s gone .
what' s the damage , spoon ? .
we' re down to forty eight rounds .
check the right .
well , ryan you heard the score .
maybe one or two of us are gonna make it through this ... ... but i don' t care much for our chances .
you like football ? .
what ? .
they think it' s all over " ... ... and all that crap ? .
no , i don' t .
well , joe ... you remember joe ? .
he liked football .
fucking lived for it .
is this relevant ? .
he missed the most important match of his life for this bullshit exercise ... ... and now he' s dead along with two other mates ... ... that i' d have readily given my right arm for !
too fucking right it' s relevant !
you just can' t get past the dog , can you ? .
we' re iosing , ryan .
we' re three nii down and we' re close to the final whistle .
at the very least , i want to even the score .
i understand your resentment .
but you failed because you weren' t prepared to take that extra step .
if you' d passed , you would have been on my team ... ... and if you were on my team , you' d be dead .
yeah , i failed , and i' m bloody glad of it .
because given the choice of taking orders from a toffee nosed twat like you ... ... and slogging it out with these guys
i' il take the underdogs any time .
so you can take your precious selection , shove it up your arse ... ... and stop trying to change the fucking subject !
fair enough .
but you won' t like what i have to tell you .
there are some places you really shouldn' t go .
we' il be the judge of that , ryan .
ever heard of special weapons division ? .
they' re the men in white coats who trains dolphins to stick mines on submarines ... ... and cute furry animals to tear your head off at the neck .
they saw an opportunity and called me in .
to do what ? .
catch one of these things ? .
and to bring it back alive , if possible .
only ' it ' turned out to be ' them ' .
we underestimated enemy numbers .
underestimated ? .
i' d have a serious word with your head sheds about the quality of their intelligence .
it may have been their invitation , but it was my party .
i planned and executed it .
you mean you loused it up .
we lost good men , ryan .
yours ... ... and mine .
i wanna know ... ... where we fit in .
the reality is you' re expendable .
and i had approval to put you at risk .
get to the fucking point , ryan .
i made a gap in enemy lines .
you were good enough to spot it ... ... and predictable enough to go for it .
that was your bait .
you were mine .
you bastard !
i had to choose somebody .
i remembered you .
monkey see , monkey do .
they were my men !
get up , you shit .
you know what we can do .
give us a fighting chance .
live and learn , cooper .
i didn' t hit him that hard .
you shook something loose .
bad dog .
fetch !
bag the shot !
clear !
get off !
cooper , get down !
i' ve got target !
werewolves spend most of the time in human form , right ? .
and the only people from miles around live right here .
so these things aren' t about to give up the fight and go home .
they are home .
yeah , well , that makes perfect sense , doesn' t it ? .
i mean , think about it we bust into their house , we eat all their porridge we sleep in their fucking beds . no wonder they' re pissed off .
but they' re good people , they' re kind people .
more' s a pity .
why ? .
because we' re gonna have to kill them all .
too right , mate .
what self respecting werewolf would have anything silver in the house anyway ? .
yeah , well , fuck the folklore
it' s just burn them .
if we knew where to find them .
maybe we do .
everything we' ve seen so far suggests the behaviour of a pack .
six to eight members , an alpha pair leading the subordinates ... ... and a young male , a beta wolf , second in command , makes sense .
no , you lost me .
a wolf pack sticks together .
generally somewhere close to its food supply .
somewhere safe , sheltered and warm .
you' re gonna have to move like shit off a shovel on this one , mate .
you worry about your own shit , all right ? .
when we blow that fuse that place is gonna go up like zabriskie point .
just make it work .
yeah , it' s easy peasy .
yeah , lemon squeezy .
listen , coop ... what about the sarge ? .
what about the sarge ? .
you know what i mean .
sarge is with us .
yeah , i just didn' t want him to go without getting his watch back .
you stay out of trouble .
you all right ? .
oh , yeah , yeah , i' m fine cooper .
i mean , i feel ... ... absolutely fantastic .
i mean , that' s the problem , isn' t it eh ? .
what if she' s wrong ? .
what if they' re not all in there , eh ? .
then we only get some of them .
it' s a shit load better than none of them ... ... and marked improvement on all of us .
no , no , no , you listen to me .
you get the fuck out now .
i hold them back , i keep them occupied and you get out !
we' ve iost enough men for on night , don' t you think ? .
let me show you something .
now do not tell me that that is fucking normal .
what happened to ryan is happening to me .
it' s just a matter of time , mate .
yeah , well , stop wasting time with this hara kiri crap .
this fight isn' t lost yet .
with ryan it only took a couple of hours , mate .
it' s a full moon .
i mean , i dunno , maybe it' s iike when you need to take a piss or something .
when you gotta go , you gotta fucking go .
or maybe it' s more like needing a shite .
just because you need one doesn' t mean you drop your legs and pinch one off .
anyway , fuck ryan .
shifty bastard could' ve been one of those things from the start .
you know , coop , there' s one more thing you gotta learn about command , mate .
sometimes the people that you kill are your own men .
so i' m asking you let me take care of myself .
and at least spare you the ... ... unfortunate business of trying to explain to annie why you had to incinerate me .
we are gonna knock seven colours of shit out of these fuckers , we need you .
it' s all right , you know , mate .
it' s okay .
i just didn' t make it out this time , that' s all .
it goes with the job , do you know what i mean ? .
when i signed my iife away on that dotted iine , i fucking meant it !
i am a professional soldier !
so , what do you want me to do ? .
roast their bollocks off .
all clear .
good luck .
light it !
shit !
sarge !
i' m sorry .
when i found you out there tonight ... ...
i truly believed you were the best chance i had of getting out .
but now we have no chance .
there is no out .
there never was .
i came here to be at one with nature well , i got what i wanted .
now i have to live with it .
there isn' t a house in the next glen .
no .
and there were no werewolves in the barn when i blew .
not one .
and the reason you' re not in the photograph is because you took it .
i never meant to ...
new woman same old shit .
being nice to women will get you nowhere , cooper .
being nice to me will get you killed .
you may think they' re all bitches , but ... ...
i' m the real thing .
do you think i iike being part of this fucked up family ? .
do you think i chose to run with the pack ? .
no .
i chose you .
but now you' re out of luck , and i' m out of time .
and all we can do is let nature take its course .
they were always here ... ...
i just unlocked the door .
it' s that time of the month .
somebody had to put it out of its misery .
come on , spoon !
get clear !
spoonie , stop fucking about !
fucking shift it , that' s an order !
oh , shit !
shit !
come on !
sarge ? .
sarge ? .
i' m in the carzey .
i' m in the carzey .
come on !
oh jesus !
shit !
go on , coop !
get stuck in , mate !
get out of it !
come on , you fucker !
come on , come on !
cooper , let' s get in the wardrobe , son .
what ? .
let' s get in the wardrobe .
yeah , all right .
what' s that smell ? .
i dunno .
fucking hell !
give me your gun .
open your mouth , watch your ears , mind your toes !
go !
go on !
where' s spoon ? . !
there is no spoon .
no , you fucking bastards !
help me , cooper .
get in there .
get in there !
sam .
what are you doing ? . !
here , take this .
there' s one in the chamber , mate .
i' m fucking binned !
no , no ...
we go together or we don' t fucking go !
that' s my iast order to you , do not fuck about .
do not disobey me !
come here , you fucking ...
listen to me , you have got to make it out alive .
it happened .
prove it happened !
not just for me or my lads ... ... for her !
here ...
you have to prove it happened , mate .
go !
go !
sam .
fuck !
ryan .
you tried licking your own balls yet ? .
i forgot you don' t fucking have any .
think it' s all over ? .
it is now .
