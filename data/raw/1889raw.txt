your father didn' t leave us well off .
he did leave us three months ' unpaid rent ... ... a life insurance policy that lapsed before he died .
he left a rather large stack of unpaid bills ... ... which i managed to take care of .
people understand our situation .
mr. biderman is a good example ... ... but it has not been easy .

your father never met an inside straight he didn' t like .

a library card ?
no , an adult library card .
oh , my .
all the master storytellers waiting for you .
you know why she picked it ?
because it was free .
that doesn' t matter .
don' t you give up on this card .
because books can be solid gold .
the great ones have gotten us through the nights for centuries .
give a writer an hour to hook you .
if he can' t , find someone else .
think you can try that ?
if i don' t have anything else to do .
fair enough .
don' t be afraid .
a tale of two cities ends with a beheading , great stuff .
lost horizon , magic and places unknown .
can' t beat that .
where' d you live before you came here , mr ?
ted ?
some other place that wasn' t as nice as this .
you l ved here long ?
yes , sir .
since my dad died .
when was that sad day ?
when i was 5 .
six years , huh ?
you must know everything happening on this street .

because nothing happens on this street .
six years .
that' s just a blink .
someday you' il agree .
you know , ben jonson called time the " old bald cheater .
what ?
ben jonson called time the " old bald cheater .
i like that .
i think i do too .
who' s ben jonson ?
he' s an english writer , dead these many years .
brilliant , but foolish about money .
and given to flatulence .
what' s flatulence ?
yeah , kids always think farts are funny .
might have a job for you .
have to think about it first .
really ?
yeah .
if it works out , you might get that bike .
how' d you know i wanted a bike ?
all kids want bikes .
hey , mom .
i took another look at that bike .
it' s a phantom , 26 incher .
real swell .
no , perfect .
perfect is more like it .
start saving those pennies .
ted ?
it' s me .
hi , kid .
come in .
thanks for making the skyward journey .
an icy root beer awaits you as reward .
colder , the better .
one feels them first at the back of one' s eyes .
feels what ?
one feels them first at the back of one' s eyes .
yeah .
hey , i did like you said .
what ?
i gave him a couple of hours .
oh , yeah .
lost horizon .
what do you think ?
better than the hardy boys .
yeah , sure is .
tell me , bobby , how' d you like to make a dollar a week ?
would i ever ? !
well , my eyes are beginning to fail me ... ... and if you will read me the harwich journal every day ... ... headline stuff , sports , comics , want ads ... ... l' il give you said dollar .
what do you say ?
what else ?
what do you mean ?
there' s got to be more to it than that .
yeah , there is .
so , what' s the real job ?
ikeep your eyes open .
for what ?
low men .
that' s right , bobby .
i use the term " low " in the dickensian sense ... ... meaning dangerous .
men who stop at nothing to get what they want .
your real job will simply be ... ... to walk around the area ... ... and if you see them or find evidence on them ... ... you' il alert me immediately .
okay .
and why are they hot on your trail ?
a certain something i have .
let' s leave it at that .
what do they look like ?
well , they wear dark clothes , dark hats .
they' re kind of anonymous ... ... but you can recognize their cars ... ... loud and flashy .
when they move , they move in packs ... ... like animals closing in on the kill .
and they cast long shadows .
oh , what a world .
they' re not cops , are they ?
or secret agents ?
are you asking me if i' m a bad guy or a commie spy ?
i' ve scamped my share of fines ... ... and if there were library police ... ... l' d be one of their 10 most wanted .
but i never robbed a bank or stole a military secret .
so who are they ?
they' re thugs , relentless ... ... when they' re after something .
like this something you have ?
that' s right .
and what they want is me , back under their control .
look out .
when they' re closing in ... ... they leave strange signs in code ... ... in obvious places like telephone poles ... ... posters and notices for lost pets and lost dogs .
if i knew what they' d do , they' d never catch me .
what do i do if i see them ?
run and tell me what you' ve seen .
i asked if you knew what was going on around here .
sure .
that' s why you' re my man , kiddo .
don' t worry , i won' t let the bogeyman get you .
bobby ?
she can' t know what you' re thinking .
you think she can , and that' s a mother' s power .
mrs. garfield .
well , it' s very cozy in here .
mom , ted i mean , mr. brautigan ... ... he' s gonna pay me a dollar a week to read him the paper .
well , that' s very generous .
do you always have boys read to you , mr. brattigan ?
it' s brautigan , ma' am .
and , yes , i need someone to do it .
my eyes aren' t what they used to be .
and what did you do before that ?
i worked up north .
various places .
well , come along , bobby .
time and tide wait for no man .
bye , mr. brautigan .
bobby .
mom , guess what mr. brautigan
something doesn' t make sense .
what ?
why would a man his age wanna spend time with a kid ?
i don' t know .
i do know that he said i must be some lucky kid ... ... to have a mom who' d let me ... ... have a grownup library card for my birthday .
i don' t know .
i trust him ... ... about as far as i could sling a piano .
that' s right , spoil it for me .
you never want me to get that bike .
i do , and i wish i could' ve gotten it for you .
but your father didn' t exactly leave us well off .
it' s only reading .
all right , what' s the harm ?
yes , yes , yes !
but only on the porch , mind , in the fresh air .
okay .
bye , bobby .
bye , carol .
sorry i' m late .
i forgot the time .
that' s all right .
we' re all time' s captives , hostages to eternity .
ben jonson ?
no , boris pasternak .
he was a russian of no account , i think .
what' s going on in the world ?
something scurrilous .
vice president richard m. nixon ... ... after having won the republican nomination ... ... on the first ballot , confers with henry cabot lodge
we' re going for ice cream .
can' t .
earning my daily bread .
afternoon , mrs. gerber .
carol .
hi , ted .
i never , ever saw a girl as special as carol gerber .
there' s millions .
oh , yeah ?
have you kissed her yet ?
yuck !
well , you will , i promise you .
stay away .
you will .
it will be the kiss by which all others ... ... in your life will be judged , and found wanting .
are you done ?
yeah .
come on , read to me .
go on .
come back here and do your job .
okay .
but you will kiss her .
oh , my god !
nice going .
get in !
get in , bobby !
come on .
come on , sully .
sully !
fbi announces new measures to combat red infiltrators .
hey , bobby .
yeah ?
tell me what dale arden' s wearing in flash gordon .
what is it with you and her ?
when i was younger i thought she was a real hotsie totsie .
okay , before comics , we' ve got sports , baseball .
maury wills on the way to break ty cobb' s record .
i saw cobb .
my dad saw babe ruth .
he saw him point for the home run .
against the cubs .
he told me all about it .
he tell you of nagurski' s comeback game ?
i know he saw it , though .
were you there ?
yeah .
you and dad were at the same place .
you know about nagurski ?
he was my dad' s hero , that' s all .
the greatest football player ever .
he came to chicago ... ... played eight years to make the bears champions .
then he retired .
when he was old , six years retired ... ... the bears brought him back .
last game of the season , they played ... ... the cardinals , sworn enemies .
the bears had to beat the cardinals to win .
nagurski wasn' t supposed to play .
third string fullback .
in the first half the starter went down .
the second half there was a pileup .
oh , no .
if your dad was here he' d say he was frightened .
he was just so scared .
but why ?
nagurski was in the game .
i was scared too .
we all were .
we wanted a miracle , you see , bobby .
we wanted him the way he was , the old nagurski .
we wanted him the way he was in the old days .
did he do good ?
i don' t wanna hear this if he didn' t .
the quarterback gave him the ball ... ... and nagurski ran slowly up to the line ... ... and the cardinals crushed him .
but somehow ... ... somehow , he gained a few yards .
next play , the same .
they just kept giving the ball to the old man ... ... and the bears began to move down the field , five yards , seven more .
if he could score for us , we' d be champions again .
go on , ted !
you can' t stop !
ted !
come on .
i gotta know what happened .
come on .
you know what your dad did then ?
no , what did my father do ?
we were all screaming .
we couldn' t believe what was happening .
my god , what was it ?
go on .
it was our miracle , you see , because he was crawling .
bronko nagurski was crawling toward the goal line ... ... and they did everything they could to stop him .
but nothing could stop him .
yeah , that' s right , bobby .
not on that day .
not when your dad and i saw the miracle ... ... when the old man brought us home .
he scored .
he scored for us .
we were champions again .
i just knew he would .
then he was gone again , back to the north where he came from .
bronko nagurski .
bobby ?
bobby o !
ted ?
yeah ?
well , i know the low men don' t exist ... ... but if they started driving around here ... ... and the signs started appearing on the poles ....
well , we both know that couldn' t happen .
but if it did ...
... would you have to go away ?
it wouldn' t be safe for me here .
and wishing cannot make it so .
bobby !
bobby ?
this ted of yours ... ... did he say where he' s from ?
someplace not as nice as here , i think .
well , that doesn' t tell us much , does it ?
anything else ?
nope .
bobby ?
does he ... ?
what ?
nothing .
you' il tell me if anything unusual happens ?
hello ?

yeah .
it' s okay .

you knew , didn' t you , where the queen of hearts was .
i could tell what was going on in his head .
every thought he had , i knew , and he couldn' t fool me .

why don' t you ask your friend to come down for a cup of tea ?
okay .
i' m sorry , mrs. garfield , but no .
i wouldn' t be much of a babysitter for bobby .
but i' ve never been invited to a real seminar before .
you could sleep on the couch , and you could go to the diner ... ... and maybe even take in a movie .
i' il tell you what .
if bobby wants me to , i will .
bobby ?
how come you get to have all the fun ?
don' t you want me to better myself ?
yeah , but what about me ?
i never get what i want .

who knows what i can afford then ?
i guess , if it' s only a weekend .
thank you .
good .
have you ever heard of privacy ?
sorry .
wait , you can' t just leave .
what do i do , then ?
tell me , how do i look ?
you look like my mom .

their senses grow keener .
hey , kiddo , you' re too young to smoke .

what ted did was open my eyes ... ... and let the future in .
i wouldn' t have missed a minute ofit .
not for all the world .
