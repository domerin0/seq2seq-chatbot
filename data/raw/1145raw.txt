hey .
hey .
thank you , dr. walsh .
you' ve earned it .

i can' t wait to get started .

well , get over here .
we' re breakin ' out the champagne .
i' il be there in a minute .
bye .
this place is heaven .
it' s been photographed for magazines .
yeah .
i think i told you i was gonna need something furnished .
well , it is furnished .
where' s the couch ?
do you believe all of this space ?
yeah , it' s great for all those raves i' il be throwing .
i' m ... sensing a " no .
wow , huh ?
i know .
this place isn' t usually available , but the couple' s spending all their time in palm springs now .
david , i' m just not quite sure what you' re looking for .
maybe if we could communicate a little more .
maybe if you could let me know a bit more about what' s going on with you , with your job , your family situation .
i don' t wanna talk about that .
stop looking for a couple of months .
start again .
you' ve gotta know where you wanna live .
i just ...
i' m ...
i' m not ... ... getting what it is you ...
hey , well ... no .
david .
david , are you kidding ?
wait , david .
look , come on .
a place like this , it is long gone by now .
no , listen , there' s 90 vultures and just one carcass .
all right , fine .
i' il call them .
he did ?
ok .
well , right .
as soon as i know .
thank you so much for your help .
well , it' s pretty obvious why this hasn' t rented .
there' s no one year lease .
it' s a month to month sublet .
why ?
some family matter .
they were pretty close mouthed about it .
wow , what a view .
david .
wow .
this is ... sensational .
oh , my god .
and it' s got the private access ?
they didn' t do much with it , but , i mean , you really could do something with this .
isn' t this gorgeous ?
well , there' s a few places in the richmond we haven' t hit yet .
i like the couch .
the couch .
good couch .
good couch .
david .
david , come here .
what ?
what ?
there' s nothing worth stealing here .
there' s no money , no drugs .
i' m not stealing anything .
ok .
i' m sure there' s a homeless shelter nearby .
i will give you money for cab fare and a good meal .
but please , don' t blow it on more beer , ok ?
i am not homeless .
i live here .
ok .
you can' t live here , because i live here .
this is my apartment .
since when ?
since i rented it .
you rented it .
yeah .
you know what ?
i don' t need this .
what ?
rent scam , right ?
what are you talking about ?
there' s probably five other people who paid deposits and got the keys .
and moved in all their things ?
yeah ...
what ?
this is my stuff .
all of this .
that' s my couch , that' s my coffee table .
is that a ring ?
have you ever heard of a coaster ?
or a trash can , for that matter ?
i don' t care who you are , you' re gonna mop that up .
i' m getting the bucket .
it' s like a pig moved into my house .
what ?
like a filthy pig .
you ...
you moved in when ?
hello ?
i told you to get out .
jesus !
ok .
so , what' s this all about ?
what ?
nothin ' .
nothin ' .
so , you called me for nothin ' ?
i' ve been sort of seeing someone .
seeing someone ?
that' s what i' m talkin ' about .
finally .
you think it' s a good thing ?
absolutely .
yeah .
the last time i tried to hook you up , you bailed out .
this is good , and the fact that you initiated it yourself , that' s important .
ok ?
now , who is she ?
do i know her ?
i mean i' m seeing someone that' s not there .
she' s emotionally unavailable ?
you mean like a hallucination .
twice , in my apartment .
a woman .
attractive ?
not really there , jack .
right .
right .
ok .
so when you saw this woman , were you drunk ?
i mean , i had a little buzz .
dave , don' t lie to me , it doesn' t help .
ok , fine , i was wasted .
but still , i shouldn' t be seeing some little blonde control freak running around my apartment .
why are you writing this down ?
this isn' t a session .
that' s insulting , ok ?
i' m your friend jack here , i' m not charging you .
but if this thing rolls into a second hour we' re gonna have to work out some kind of deal .
i' m kidding .
so , hold on a second .
you were drunk ,
you saw this blonde , controlling ...
i gotta stop drinkin ' .
no .
no ?
yeah , drink , party .
just do it with other people .
god gave us alcohol as a social lubricant .
make men brave , make women loose .
what is that , some berkeley shrink thing ?
no .
look around you , ok ?
see this ?
this is the world .
join it .
stop swimming around in your own mind .
that is a dangerous neighborhood you should not go into alone .
come on , dave .
it' s been two years , man .
no more hiding out .
absolutely not .
are you insane ?
what are you doing ?
oh , god , what is this ?
i didn' t want to , but i will call the police .
i' m sleeping .
it' s a dream .
it' s one of those dreams and you know you' re dreaming .
how do you keep getting in here ?
it' s you who' s in here .
oh , my .
this is more serious than i thought .
go away , you don' t exist .
i' m gonna ask you a series of questions .
i want you to answer honestly .
has your recent alcohol consumption increased ?
yeah , so ?
are you hearing voices or seeing things that aren' t quite real to you ?
as a matter of fact , yeah .
have you recently sought consult from a mental health care professional ?
what ?
how do you know ?
stay away from me .
do you feel paranoid , like people are out to get you ?
why are you asking so many questions ?
i' il take that as a " yes " .
listen to me .
you have fantasized , quite convincingly , that you' ve rented an apartment that , in fact , belongs to somebody else .
pick up that pillow .
pick it up .
it' s ok .
there' s a small red stain on the back where i once spilled cherry cough syrup .
yes , that' s it .
how else would i know that ?
or the fact that these sheets that you' re now soiling are from nordstrom .
i still have the receipt , it' s in that drawer .
open it up and check .
i think you need to come to terms with the fact that you may be mentally ill .
really ?
yes .
this is my apartment .
these are my sheets .
that' s my nightstand .
that' s my picture ...
where' s my picture ?
what picture ?
there was a picture there of my ...
there was a picture right there on the nightstand .
that was empty when i moved in .
it was just there .
you know what ?
i' ve had enough .
i am calling the police .
no , no , no , no .
it' s too late .
what' d you do to my phone ?
why can' t i ... ?
you stay right there .
i' m gonna use the one in the kitchen .
hey , grace , david abbott here .
the people who sublet this apartment to me ,
do you have their number ?
is something wrong ?
no , no .
i was just wondering about the previous tenant , that' s all .
well , the woman that i dealt with , she didn' t want to talk about it .
it was some kind of tragedy in the family .
i didn' t press for details ' cause i don' t need any more drama .
you think this girl died ?
well , you better hope so .
that' s the only way they' re gonna get off this month to month thing and give you a real lease .
that' s not exactly the reason i was ...
come on , david , grow up .
look , it has a view , a fireplace .
people would kill their grandmothers for a lot less in this city .
can i help you with anything ?
no .
i mean , do you believe in this stuff ?
well , you don' t until you do .
that' s a little dated .
i recommend the rosemary preston .
it' s totally seminal .
' scuse me .
where' s your ufo section ?
it' s back and to the left .
ufology .
it' s not even a real science .
so , what kind of encounter have you had ?
encounter ?
ectoplasm ?
soniferous ether ?
i have a killer sance book if you' re into communication .
communicating is not her problem .
righteous .
i have exactly what you need .
yeah .
crap !
there .
spirit , awake .
spirit , partake .
spirit , without fear .
spirit , appear .
are ... are you here ?
come on , i think you' re here .
ok .
i' ve got a hot , moist cup of coffee in my hand .
there is no coaster on this table .
i' m going to set it down on this lovely mahogany ...
don' t you dare !
we ...
we need to talk .
about what ?
has it crossed your mind that there might be something a little off about the way you' ve been spending your days ?
actually , yes .
it' s weird having a squatter in your living room .
i am not ...
ok , let' s start over .
hi , i' m david abbott .
and you are ... ?
i am ...
i' m elizabeth .
my name is elizabeth .
you didn' t know that .
you ... you had to read that .
i think i know my own name .
ok .
when was the last time that you remember actually talking to someone other than me ?
the other day .
the other day .
and ...
and when you' re not here , what do you do with the rest of your day ?
certainly a lot more than you do , that' s for sure .
let' s not stray from the point , lizzie .
don' t call me lizzie .
i' m not in kindergarten .
my name' s elizabeth .
you think .
let me ask you , has anything dramatic happened to you recently ?
like what ?
i don' t know , like dying maybe ?
how dare you say that to me ?
ok , calm down .
get your hands off of me , you pervert !
calm down .
i' m not ...
i' m not here to hurt you .
i' m trying to help you face the fact that ...
i' m not dead .
look around you .
there should be a bright light .
there' s no light .
walk into the light , elizabeth !
there is no light !
i am not dead !
i think i would know if i was dead !
what' s happening to me ?
you' re dead !
stop saying that !
missed .
ok .
ok , that' s enough .
that' s enough .
you' re just giving me a headache !
get off of me !
ok .
all right , all right .
it' s not my fault you' re the way you are .
i just want you out of my house .
you get out !
rest in peace .
i' m not leaving .
another one , my , my .
golden state playing very well ...
i love ya tomorrow
you' re only a day away
tomorrow , tomorrow
i love ya tomorrow
you' re only a day away
fine !
the sun' il come out tomorrow
bet your bottom dollar that tomorrow
you know what ?
that' s it .
i' ve had it with you .
i' ve tried to be nice , but now you' re outta here !
the power of christ compels you !
the power of christ compels you !
the power of christ compels you !
the power of christ compels you !
he can' t even see me .
a little more left .
you' re mopping that up .
more , more .
they' re gonna set off the smoke detector .
dad , we got it !
all set , sir .
we have the spirit .
a butter dish .
you sure ?
oh , definitely .
i have him right here .
i' m gonna go give him a flush .
that' s it ?
you just sit there ?
hey , you want bells and whistles or a reading ?
come on .
he can' t see me , either .
for some hideous reason , only you can .
ok , there' s somethin ' .
definitely a presence .
how original .
tell me more .
it' s hostile .
wants you outta here .
actually , he' s not bad .
you should move , dude .
i should move ?
i would .
i like him .
no , i' m not gonna move .
can' t you feel that , man ?
there' s like this cancer causing ray of spirit hate
searing right towards your body .
this kid' s got a gift .
i' m not moving !
why not ?
it' s not like it' s that great an apartment .
what ?
yes , it is .
it' s got a view .
and a fireplace .
whatever , dude .
yo , do you have , like , a diet anything ?
i' m , like , 99 . 9 percent parched here .
could really use a cola .
yeah .
come on .
move out ?
that ... that can' t be it .
could you talk to her and tell her she should pass on ?
could you please talk to her ?
i' m ignoring you .
i' m ignoring you .
she won' t accept that she' s dead .
i told her to walk to the light .
she wouldn' t do it .
that' s because there is no light .
god , you' re infuriating !
wait , what' s goin ' on ?
you know what ?
do you think i like this ?
do you think this is easy for me ?
i know something' s different , something is not right .
i' m walking through walls .
you know ,
i don' t think i can help you .
this is one of the most alive spirits i' ve ever been around .
she' s not goin ' anywhere .
what do you mean ?
i agree with her , dude .
she' s not dead .
but you , whoa .
you gotta deal with this ...
' cause seriously , that' s like the darkest aura i' ve ever seen .
suckin ' the life right outta you .
it' s killin ' you , man .
you have to let her go , dude .
how can i , when she won' t leave ?
not your spirit girl .
i' m talkin ' ' bout the other one .
the one you' re keepin ' in here .
that' s what' s really haunting you , isn' t it ?
i don' t want to talk about that .
i get it .
you were dumped .
probably for some guy who doesn' t have a couch fused to his ass .
shut up !
you can dish it out but you can' t take it ?
you bring father flanagan and the joy luck club to get rid of me .
but i talk about you getting dumped once ...
you don' t know what the hell you' re talking about .
shut the hell up !
sorry for your loss , bro .
a word to the wise , girl .
show some respect for the dead .
david ?
i' m sorry .
it occurred to me now that i ... ... probably don' t know you all that well .
i got this place for the roof .
i was gonna do a whole garden out here ... ... eventually , i think .
now i' m babbling .
i ...
i' m really sorry .
most people who deal with loss really find it helpful to talk about things .
i don' t want to talk about it !
anger works too .
who was he talking about ?
laura .
her name was laura .
who' s laura ?
she was my wife .
what do you think i am , stupid ?
what is this ?
oh , come on .
don' t .
this is not gonna help .
how would you know ?
have you ever been in a bar in your life ?
the groundhog emerges !
i didn' t think you' d make it .
all right !
all right !
it' s jeff , jody , kim , valerie .
this is my buddy , dave .
nice to meet you .
what are you drinkin ' ?
coffee .
scotch !
don' t you dare !
make it a double !
you don' t have to wait .
i can start the hangover right now .
yeah .
yeah .
he' s excited to be out .
i know !
friday night !
you can' t drink these feelings away .
watch me .
so , you ok ?
say goodbye , walk to the door , let' s get some food in your stomach .
who made you my mother ?
did i ... ?
how you comin ' along with those hallucinations ?
that was nothing .
you' re not a well man , david .
it' s just a lack of sleep .
sleep ?
you gettin ' any ?
eight hours .
twelve .
nine , tops .
opium addicts are more alert than you .
will you knock it off .
don' t you dare !
don' t !
last chance .
what are you gonna do about it ?
dave , buddy !
i' m so ...
i' m sorry .
god !
you freak !
dave , that is uncool , man !
good god !
you' re gonna thank me for that one day .
for what ?
making me look like a lunatic in front of all those people ?
why are you still here ?
that' s a scary question .
i have no idea .
why are you the only one that can see me ?
don' t ask me .
all i know is when i' m not with you , it' s like i don' t ... exist .
oh , my god .
maybe i am dead .
oh , come on now .
i' m ...
i' m sorry that i said you' re dead .
maybe you' re not dead .
maybe you' re just very ... light .
if i could just remember something about who i am , or was .
i mean , then i' d know once and for all .
i' m trying to figure it out .
i ...
i just can' t do it by myself .
you' re not asking me to ... to help you , are you ?
look .
you have two realities to choose from .
first one being that a woman has come into your life in a very unconventional way and she happens to need your assistance .
right .
the second one is that you' re an insane person , sitting on a park bench talking to yourself .
i think i prefer the first one .
ok .
let' s find out who i am .
no .
i think that apartment was vacant .
that was a woman ?
nobody live there .
it' s like i was a ghost before i was dead .
hi .
can i help you ?
finally , somebody normal .
i bet we were friends .
hi , i' m ...
i' m david .
i am a new tenant here .
hi , david , katrina .
come on in .
she' s friendly , i like her .
this' il just take a sec .
i have a question .
the apartment upstairs , it belonged to a young woman .
yeah , i think there was somebody up there .
but she was , like , totally antisocial .
ok , maybe we weren' t close friends .
kind a like a cat lady , but without any cats .
right ?
ok , i think we' re done here .
let' s go .
ok , thank you .
look .
this is so retro , but i' ve got a window i can' t get open .
she' s got to be kidding .
what ?
what ?
what ?
she wants you to come in .
well , if it' s painted shut and you use a screwdriver to jam it , it sometimes ...
oh , tried it .
won' t budge .
no preliminaries .
incredible .
i' d like to help , but i have dinner plans .
well , i got dessert .
i just threw up in my mouth .
well , ok .
i ...
nice to meet you .
you too , dave .
thanks .
why is she wearing workout clothes ?
if you were gonna work out in the middle of the day , the only reason to wear workout clothes , do you really need a push up bra ?
the whole point' s to strap ' em down .
you' re not comin ' with me anymore .
why ?
something might jog my memory .
too bad .
you' re like an am radio someone shoved in my head and i can' t turn off .
you don' t think she was completely un classy and predatory ?
those happen to be two of men' s favorite things .
why don' t you just date a pit bull ?
maybe i will .
damn it !
what ?
i locked my key in the apartment .
there' s a spare key under the fire extinguisher .
i mean , i guess she' s sexy if you' re into that whole tall , big boobs ,
long legs , model y sorta thing .
i guess if you wanna be that guy .
there are five other units here , and not one person even remembers what you look like .
talk about being disconnected .
are you sure you really want that ?
yes , i' m sure .
next drawer on the left .
there' s a funnel in there too , if you need it .
check it out .
what is it ?
new leads .
look , there' s an address written on here .
i can' t make that out .
is that a five or a six ?
i think it' s a ...
no , no , no , that' s a five .
definitely a five .
so we have an address , a dry cleaning ticket and a book of matches .
you know what that means ?
we could start a very small fire ?
there' s still hope .
oh , yes , these pants were jet black .
armani , i believe .
i remember them .
they were expensive .
do you remember anything else about the woman ?
it' s important .
she' s pleasant , but a little dull maybe .
dull ?
dull ?
i think of her , i think of sadness , loneliness .
i don' t need a psychological profile from this guy .
can we just get the pants ?
can i get the pants ?
item left too long .
we give them to homeless shelter .
are you insane ?
they were armani .
ok , let' s go .
are you coming or not ?
they' re pants , what do you need ' em for ?
425 , i think .
look familiar ?
not really .
hi .
hello .
can i help you ?
hi .
this might sound a little odd , but i was wondering if you knew a certain woman .
blond , about five foot one ...
two .
and a half .
two and a half ?
oh , my god .
who are you ?
i don' t know you .
i ...
did my wife hire you ?
i' m sorry , what ?
i knew she' d find out .
whatever she' s payin ' you , i' il double it .
anything you want .
i' m not looking for money .
donald !
who is it ?
that' s her .
come back around six .
i' il have a check ready .
wow .
what ?
you don' t think i actually had sex with that old horndog .
kind a looks that way , lizzie .
it' s elizabeth .
and that' s disgusting .
well , look on the bright side .
at 6 : 00 , i' m coming into some money .
thank you .
you' re welcome .
oh , my god .
maybe i was a slut .
a lonely , home wrecking slut .
so what if i was a slut ?
there' s nothing wrong with a healthy sexual appetite .
not at all .
look who i' m talking to , mr. tried to feel me up one time .
i' m trying to agree with you .
david .
what ?
this is it .
you recognize it ?
good .
ok .
come on .
this is moose' s .
i love this restaurant .

st. matthews ?
i may have been a home wrecking whore , but i saved lives .
i worked in that hospital .
i know it , it sounds so familiar .
i' ve never saved a life before .
it' s the best .
one minute you' re looking at this monitor , it says " game over , " then you bring it back , a little blip and it' s there !
what' s that ?
that' s just a little blood .
david ?
i work here .
you did ?
the receptionist , her name is amita .
it' s all coming back to me now .
there' s bill and karen and michael and ...
elizabeth ?

masterson .

yes , that' s it .
elizabeth masterson .
dr. masterson is ... ... is not active on our staff right now .
hold on .
let me talk to someone .
excuse me , doctor ?
oh , no , she' s got the tone .
what tone ?
the tone .
you' re trying to pass the buck onto somebody else to tell you your friend died !
excuse me , sir .
i need you to go to the third floor nurses ' station .
oh , no , it' s fran .
she' s my mentor .
they wouldn' t send us here if it wasn' t bad .
mr. abbott ?
hi , yes .
fran lo .
nice to meet you .
you' ve been inquiring about elizabeth masterson ?
right .
could you tell me what happened to her ?
i need to know your relationship with her .
tell her you' re my boyfriend .
she can' t tell you anything unless she knows we' re intimately connected .
we were romantic with each other .
what do you mean ?
you know , boyfriend girlfriend .
i know what romantic means , but i ...
i have a hard time believing that .
what ?
why ?
what ?
why ?
elizabeth' s whole life was this hospital .
was " ?
did she say " was " ?
i don' t know of a single date she' d ever been on .
we were fairly recent .
i live in her apartment ...
david .
building .
so , you don' t know about the accident .
accident .
oh , god , david .
i remember it .
it was awful .
i was ...
i' ve been away .
it was three months ago .
three months .
i' m sorry .
i was away for awhile on a business trip .
oh , my god .
what was that ?
you were , like , flying .
oh , my god .
it' s you .
it' s you , it' s really you .
you' re ... you' re not dead , you' re alive .
i know , david , but i' m in a coma .
this is not good .
well , it' s way better than dead .
look at you .
your body is healing , it' s ...
you don' t have any scars .
you look pretty .
it doesn' t matter how i look .
three months , that' s a persistent coma .
we' re here now .
let' s do something .
like what ?
like ...
i don' t know .
you' re the doctor .
right .
right .
forget it .
what ?
i was gonna say that we ...
i need to find a way to put myself together again .
ok , good , good .
that' s great .
how do we do that ?
maybe i should try this .
something' s happening !
yeah , yeah , yeah !
i think it' s working !
yeah ?
no .
let me try again .
i mean , really focus on it .
hold on inside there .
i' m not sticking .
it' s like i' m no longer connected to this body .
all right , all right , all right , all right .
turn around .
what ?
i want to try something .
ok .
you felt that .
my hand tingled .
you are still connected to your body .
the monitor doesn' t agree .
machines don' t know everything .
everything in my training tells me they do .
then how are we having this conversation ?
i don' t know .
mr. abbott ?
i' m sorry .
i have an appointment , and i can' t leave you here unattended .
can i just have a couple more minutes , please ?
i' m saying goodbye .
of course .
thank you .
my nieces must have made these things for me .
wow , that' s an amazing likeness .
look at this .
that' s the picture from my nightstand .
abby must have brought it .
you look great .
look at me now .
these levels aren' t changing , david .
if anything , they' re decreasing .
i' m gonna have to leave soon .
all right .
want me to wait downstairs in the lobby ?
no , no , that' s sweet .
you should go .
thank you for helping me .
it was my pleasure .
are you sure you don' t want to come back with me ?
after all , it is your apartment .
it' s fine .
after i made it here , i ... ... can' t imagine leaving myself , you know ?
ok , i know , i just ...
it just feels weird leaving you here alone .
i don' t know where else i belong .
mr. abbott .
i' m sorry .
goodbye , elizabeth .
goodbye .
oh , i hate this .
she finally gets a life , and then ...
you know what ?
that guy was cute .
at least she got a chance to hang with him for a little while .
yeah .
it woulda been awful if she' d gone through her whole life not knowing what it was all about .
oh , my god .
jenny ?
no wonder i could never find you .
i guess you got my job .
yeah .
i think i' ve earned it .
i deserve it .
everything you thought it would be ?
it is .
and it' s time to upgrade from the 330 to the 740 .
i' m goin ' to the dealer tonight .
hold on .
it' s walsh , i have to take this .
hello ?
really ?
you want me to do it ?

abby .
i remember saying no running , no screaming !
abby , can you feel me ?
all right , chill , i' m serious .
i guess not .
i hope you feel better .

i love you .
i remember when you pushed us ...
it' s so sweet you guys come and visit me .
and i really miss ...
excuse me .
mrs. brody , hi .
hi .
dr. rushton .
could i have a quick word ?
sure .
what do you want ?
first of all , i hope you know how much we all love and miss elizabeth .
please .
he' s doing high fives he' s not in phoenix .
because she was a senior resident here , we' ve taken some extraordinary measures to make her feel more comfortable these last three months .
lily !
turn it back !
zoe , what did we talk about ?
watch your sister .
sorry .
this is hard to say .
when we come to work here , we are asked to sign release forms .
ok .
i don' t like the sound of this .
did you know your sister' s opinion about artificially prolonging life ?
no .
she was against it .
really ?
ok , that was before .
i am completely for it now .
honestly , most in our profession feel that way .
not me !
i' m perfectly happy .
come on , abby !
you have got to feel me , i' m your sister !
but there' s still some brain activity , isn' t there ?
people have woken up from this kind of coma .
all the time .
not on any record i' ve found .
of course they have !
otherwise , what am i doing here ?
i feel car sick .
what are you doing ?
we' re looking for the stick .
what stick ?
you said she had a stick up her ...
stop it !
come on .
tv is going to become a very dim memory for you two .
mrs. brody , elizabeth did sign a release .
because of the special situation , we won' t take any terminal action without your explicit approval .
now , i' ve prepared this paperwork ...
don' t sign that .
i' m here ! ... if you decide to sign ...
i' il think about it .
abby , i' il baby sit more , i swear !
those jeans you love ?
they' re yours !
we sometimes find that it' s easier just to ask god' s forgiveness and not prolong the inevitable .
i said i' d think about it .
thank you , abby .
you always looked out for me .
you here ?
i guess not .
i' m locked out .
doesn' t this location make san francisco bearable ?
wait , you' re not from here , are you ?
oh , good .
and what' s with all the single men in this town ?
every time i meet a good looking guy ... lesbian .
it' s tough .
i' d get on the phone and i' d be like ,
hello ?
osama ?
communism is so over .
like , give your people toilet paper .
so , like , if i had to choose ?
if i had to choose .
wow .
i guess i' d have to go with the midget .
i' m sorry ...
the locksmith , does he know to ring my unit ?
i think so .
where' s your bathroom ?
it' s right down the hall there .
ok .
elizabeth !
yeah .
no , i just ...
i didn' t think you were gonna come back .
i thought you were gonna stay at the hospital with your body .
it' s terrible .
they' re trying to get my sister to sign papers authorizing permission to take me off of life support .
no !
what ?
they can' t do that !
i know .
i said that .
nobody could hear me .
and i just wanted to talk to you .
david !
just a minute !
well , that didn' t take very long .
no .
no , she barged in .
she got locked out of her apartment .
you don' t have to explain .
i get it .
no , you don' t get anything .
she' s using the bathroom ...
her voice sounded like it came from the bedroom .
it did ?
come here .
i want to show you something .
when you know , you know , right ?
i had no idea that' s ...
you had no idea she was naked on your bed .
no .
you' re wondering what she looks like .
no , i' m not .
a little ?
not enough to go look .
tell you what .
i' il do a little recon for ya .
please don' t !
don' t worry .
i' m a doctor .
elizabeth .
no , no , no , no , no .
relax .
she' s got a tattoo on her ass .
it says " all aboard .
really ?
in three languages .
oh , that' s funny .
she' s very cultural .
you know , you sound jealous .
oh , please .
you do .
are you talkin ' to someone ?
hey , what' s goin ' on ?
eyes up top , david .
nothing .
look , i' m sorry if i' m coming on a little too strong .
that' s just my style .
i hear you sometimes .
up here ... ... by yourself ...
and i just figured ... ... maybe he' s lonely .
i know i am .
is it wrong for me to want to touch someone ?
to be close ?
feel a warm body next to me ?
david , just do it .
what ?
go ahead , be with her .
it' s what you both want .
no , it isn' t .
are you all right ?
do you ... wanna take some kind of medication first ?
it' s cool if you do .
david , it' s ok .
she' s beautiful , and she' s right here in front of you .
and i' m in the way .
no , you' re not .
elizabeth .
elizabeth !
it' s katrina .
that was quick .
come on , nothing happened .
what' d you say to her ?
that i was seeing someone .
honestly ?
well , i didn' t mention that i was the only person who could .
you know , i haven' t ... ... haven' t really been with anyone since ... ... since laura .
she was cursing at her shoe .
her heel had broken .
and then she just kind a sat down and put her hand to her head .
oerebral hemorrhage ?
and ...
i couldn' t do anything to help her .
she was , like , gone .
i couldn' t even say goodbye , and she was just ...
she' s gone .
what was she like ?
you know , she was just a big pain in the ass .
no , really .
i mean , the bras on the doorknobs ,
leaving the car with the ... with the gas needle below empty .
she couldn' t put gas in the car .
it was impossible for her .
and just total stubborn inability to master a remote .
so she would just randomly click buttons , until the tv was snarled into some unmanageable condition .
i mean , i' m so ...
i' m mad just thinking ...
... thinking about her .
i' m sorry , david .
your sister really wouldn' t sign those papers , would she ?
i don' t know .
i hope not .
won' t even matter if i don' t wake up soon .
my brain activity' s decreasing every day .
maybe that' s not such a bad thing .
you' re kind of a smarty pants .
no , it' il bring you down to my level .
you' re not dumb , david , just a little lazy .
cute , but lazy .
thank you .
i wasn' t always like this , you know .
what were you like ?
come on .
i want to show you something .
where are we ?
it' s an estate .
the guy' s in hawaii this time of year .
are we trespassing ?
don' t worry , we' re not going inside .
here it is .
you said you love gardens .
what is this place ?
i made this place .
this is my work .
i was a landscape architect .
i had my own company for awhile .
david , i' ve been here before .
what do you mean ?
i know this is gonna sound really strange , but i dreamed of this place .
these flowers , everything .
it' s beautiful .
i had no idea , david .
what a joy it must be to create a place like this .
yeah , it was .
is it gonna be again ?
sure .
promise ?
who the hell' s calling me ?
hello ?
david , it' s grace .
well , you are the luckiest man in san francisco .
thank you .
why do you say that ?
great news , the apartment is yours .
and they' re willing to give you a nice long lease .
how long a lease ?
really long .
and i' m gonna send it over ,
and i' il talk to you tomorrow .
wait , wait , wait .
why are they giving me a long lease now ?
it' s a terrible story .
the tenant was in some kind of coma , and it is what it is , so they' re gonna pull the plug .
they are gonna throw in that couch you like .
david ?
what ?
we gotta go talk to your sister .
why ?
what are you gonna say to her ?
i don' t know .
what kind of dirt do you have on her ?
her middle name is ellen .
in the third grade she told everybody it was leia , like princess leia .
what else ?
she' s lactose intolerant .
all right , the only way this is gonna work is if i could tell her something that only you know .
something so intimate , so personal ...
she french kissed her ex boyfriend j. j. five minutes before her wedding .
oh , that' il work .
that' s good .
nobody knows that .
that ...
i think i like her already .
so , how did you know elizabeth ?
you must' ve worked together .
god knows she wasn' t dating anybody .
everybody likes to rub that one in .
actually , this is gonna be a little difficult to swallow ...
tea !
my nieces are here ?
they' re supposed to be at school .
hi .
would you like some tea , sir ?
well , yes , thank you , madam .
abort .
don' t do this in front of them , it' s gonna freak them out .
i' m sorry , you were saying ?
how did you know her ?
lie your butt off .
we worked together .
no !
no .
no , no , no .
you' re not credible as a doctor .
make something up .
i mean , i didn' t work with her .
we worked together on my illness .
i was a patient of hers .
lily ?
can you see me ?
i was sick .
i had meningitis .
spiral meningitis .
i' m so sorry .
spiral meningitis ?
it' s not a disease .
oh , no , it' s ok .
i' m much better now .
i ...
elizabeth , she believed in me , believed that i would recover when nobody else did .
and then i did .
that sounds just like her .
but why are you telling me this ?
because i know about elizabeth' s situation , and i just wanna say that ...
lily . ... there are things ...
you know i' m here , don' t you ? ... sometimes that ... ... that are beyond our understanding .
and so , i just wanted to ask you ...
actually , i just want to beg you to ... to give her a little bit more time .
she' s gonna pull through this thing .
i just know it .
that' s really sweet of you to say , but ... it' s kind a too late .
abby .
what do you mean ?
abby , what did you do ?
it' s david , right ?
you see , it' s too late because i' ve already signed the papers .
abby .
i' m here .
can you feel me ?
i' m right here .
we' re terminating life support tomorrow at noon , while the girls are in school .
i mean , the past three months have been so hard on them , on this whole family .
well , i understand that .
i really do .
but i think you' re makin ' a grave mistake here ,
because i really believe ...
it' s for the best .
really .
this is what elizabeth wanted .
i mean , i spent my whole life thinking i knew what was best for her .
what she should wear , what men she should date .
this is the last thing elizabeth asked for .
and for the first time in my life , i' m gonna respect her wishes .
oh , abby .
look .
this is gonna sound really strange to you , but ...
oh , no , no , no . ... the truth is elizabeth is here with us right now .
she came here with me , she' s standing next to you , begging you to wait .
right next to me ?
right there .
david , stop .
no , let me do this .
i don' t know how or why , but somehow i can see your sister' s spirit .
i know it' s crazy , but i also can talk to her .
so why don' t i have her just explain the whole thing to you , and i' il translate .
could you just hold on , just a sec ?
ok , tea party' s over .
time for wiggly safari !
yeah !
ok , david , this could work .
i think i was getting through to her .
you need to get her to the hospital .
right to the hospital .
we' il get her to rip those papers ...
get the hell outta here , you freak !
i' m not makin ' this up !
why would i ?
abby , calm down , just calm down !
i' il chop you !
i swear , i will chop you !
tell about j. j. i know about j. j.
what ?
i know what you did with j. j.
i' il tell everybody .
how do you know that ?
nobody knows that !
get outta here !
get going !
you kids ok ?
mommy , is auntie elizabeth gonna have more tea ?
what ?
i don' t think your sister' s a very spiritual person .
she' s just bein ' a good mom .
tryin ' to keep her kids away from a crazy guy .
i think i would have liked to have been a mom .
you' d make a good one .
thanks .
guess i' il never really know .
come on , lizzie .
this can' t be it .
lizzie ?
ok , i' m sorry .
i know you don' t like to be called that .
i' m warming up to it .
i can go to that hospital .
i could talk to your friend , fran .
i could ...
no , david . ... talk to the asshole guy .
brett ?
no .
just stop , they' il put you in a straitjacket .
there' s no way anyone' s gonna believe i' m still here .
your niece , the little girl .
she saw you .
oh , great .
my fate' s in the hands of a four year old who has seven other imaginary friends .
wait .
there is someone else .
what do you mean ?
come on .
darryl !
dude .
yeah .
the spirit' s with you , isn' t it ?
you can' t bring that here .
what are you thinking , bro ?
you were right .
she' s alive .
righteous .
she' s in a coma .
her family' s gonna take her off life support .
not so righteous .
so , what , are you guys socializing now ?
we' ve ... acclimated .
yeah , i can tell .
in fact , i' m sensin ' some pretty intense feelings she has for you , bro .
really ?
no , i don' t .
major red aura .
somebody' s embarrassed .
i am not .
can we focus here ?
ok .
ask him if there' s a spell ...
or a chant .
anything to get ...
my spirit ... ... back into her body ?
you' re asking the wrong question .
why is that wrong ?
look , i have the gift .
i didn' t ask for it , but i do .
i can sense these things , spirits , whatever you wanna call ' em .
why they' re hangin ' here in the first place ?
that' s their unfinished business .
do i have the gift ?
dude , please .
you definitely don' t have it .
you' re a civilian .
but if i don' t have it , how is it that i can see her and talk to her when no one else can ?
exactly .
exactly what ?
that' s the right question .
what the hell is he talking about ?
god , i feel like it' s right there in front of us .
i just can' t get a handle on it .
how do you solve a problem that isn' t possible in the first place ?
because nothing seems impossible to me anymore .
i mean , why did i move into your apartment in the first place ?
why can i see you when no one else can ?
i mean , why was i down in that restaurant when that guy collapsed ?
it all seems interrelated somehow .
what are you doing ?
i don' t know .
i feel like i missed something here .
wait a second .
rosemary preston lives right here in san francisco .
we could go talk to her .
i' il call information , maybe she' s listed .
where did you get this ?
it was just at the hospital .
yeah .
i ...
i took it .
i' m sorry .
i ...
i just ...
i wanted to have a picture of you .
i wasn' t sure that i was gonna ever see you again .
i' m sorry .
don' t be sorry .
that' s really nice .
i really like that picture .
yeah .
yeah , i liked it too .
i had just gotten my moat scores back .
well , you must' ve done well .
no , actually , i bombed .
my scores were so low
i couldn' t even get into correspondence school .
and that' s a good thing ?
no .
i know it sounds kind a crazy .
i wanted to go back to the library and start studying immediately , but abby said no .
the only thing to do was to burn my scores and drink margaritas .
lots and lots of margaritas .
well , looks like she was right .
it' s just funny because the one time i completely failed at something ,
i had more fun than i' d ever had in my life .
you look happy .
i was happy .
but what was i doing with the rest of my time ?
when i think about my life and i ...
all i can remember is working .
you know ?
working and working and trying so hard .
and for what ?
you help people .
you save lives .
yeah .
including my own .
i saved my life , for later .
i just ...
i never thought there wouldn' t be a later .
no , don' t say that .
there' s still time .
we' re gonna see this lady ...
you know , i just don' t want to spend my last night crying .
or ... fighting my fate .
i wanna do something with you .
ok .
ok , great .
what do you want to do ?
you want to fly to paris ?
see the eiffel tower ?
no problem .
you wanna dance on a beach in bali ?
let' s go !
let' s do it !
anywhere in the world that will take mastercard or visa .
anywhere .
there is something that i would like to do .
anything .
i' m so bad at this .
what ?
what is it ?
are you nervous ?
a little .
why ?
i don' t know .
how can you be nervous when i can' t even touch you ?
i think i' m more nervous because you can' t touch me .
why ?
you know in the hospital when you touched my hand ?
i felt it .
i mean , my spirit felt it .
i don' t know how .
but i think if you could ever really touch me ... ... i might wake up from all of this .
i can almost feel that .
me too .
i think i know what my unfinished business is .
what ?
you .
elizabeth .
elizabeth ?
elizabeth ? !
i' m right here .
oh , good , good .
i thought you were gone .
suddenly i know what i' m supposed to do , because this time i can do something .
what are you talking about ?
lizzie , when we first met , i kept saying that you were dead .
but it was me that was dead , and you brought me back .
you saved me .
and now it' s my turn to save you .
how ?
i' m gonna steal your body .
david .
david .
david , what are you thinking ?
you can' t do this !
why can' t i ?
because you' il go to jail .
so ?
