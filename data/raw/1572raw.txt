last week an agency field officer tried to make a buy off of one ofher ops .
he was trying to sell out a mole or something and you got to him before we did .
i killed him ?
you left a print .
there were partial prints that trace back to treadstone .
they know it was you .
that is insane .
why are you doing this ?
why come back now ?
landy will find ...
stop .
stop .
last week i was 4, 000 miles away in india , watching marie die .
they came for me , and they killed her instead .
this ends now .
find her .
what do you people want with me ?
why are you trying to frame me ?

i' m only here because of paris .
abbott dragged us ...

did he run treadstone ?
yes .
conklin reported to him .
please .
please , i swear ...
what was landy buying ?
what kind of files ?
conklin ...
stuff on conklin .
it was something to do with a russian politician .
neski .
wh what ?
what are you talking about ?
training is over ...
training is over ...
training is over ...
when ...
when was i here in berlin ?
what are you talking about ?
for treadstone .
i did a job here .
when ?
no , you never worked in berlin before .
my first job .
in berlin .
you know my file .
you' ve never worked berlin before .
my first job !
no , your first assignment was geneva .
you fucking people !
i swear !
i swear !
i know i was here , nicky !
it' s not in your file !
i know i was here !
no , i swear ...
oh , please . !
pam , i want to show you something .
it' s alexanderplatz .
we got three levels , we got 15 tunnels .
they' re all converging in a five block radius .
over here , luftschulzbunker .
that was an old war shelter .
how many men are out there ?
two coming down the back stairs .
the rest , they' re fanned out for a search .
what' s our security situation here ?
where , " here " ?
the ground ?
here here .
in the building .
check everything , and recheck all the stairwells , hallways , everything .
it' s done .
okay , let' s go public .
release his photo to the berlin police .
and check out his story about the girlfriend in india too .
i' m on it .
you' re in a big puddle of shit , pamela , and you don' t have the shoes for it .
he said he didn' t know anything about berlin .
he knew that nicky was wearing a wire .
don' t you think that was for our benefit ?
he didn' t sound like a man in control to me .
we know he was in berlin .
his mind is broken .
we broke it .
and now ...
what now ?
terminate him ?
you' ve been pushing that agenda ever since we got here .
he also said you were running treadstone .
should we believe that too ?
i' m convinced bourne knows something .
he knows that you' re after him , and in the interest of self preservation you might start with that .
check on those photos .
have they gone out ?
i need to show you something .
all right , i finished my box work , but i wanted to show you before i showed landy .
came down here last night ... because none of this is making any sense .
i' m with you ...
conklin was a nut .
but a traitor ?
i just can' t get there .
what do you have , danny ?
all right , you put a four gam kel on here , it' s gonna take out power to the building .
you know that .
there were two charges that were supposed to go off simultaneously .
the second one , over here , didn' t go off .
now , first of all , this is nothing .
it' s a sub line for the breaker above .
and second , why put the charge all the way down here ?
if you' re good enough to get in here and handle the gear , you' re good enough to know you don' t need this .
bourne would know .
it was staged ?
is it a slam dunk ?
no .
but what if somebody were trying to cover their tracks by blaming conklin and bourne ?
what if bourne didn' t have anything to do with this ?
show me again .
all right .
well , you put ...
pull over .
he' s getting out .
this is not a drill , soldier .
we clear on that ?
this is a live project , and you' re a go .
i' il see you on the other side .
## [ piano ]
good evening , sir .
how can i help you ?
i want to get a room for the night .
do you have a reservation ?
no .
actually , is room 645 available ?
i' ve stayed there before .
i' m sorry , sir .
that room is occupied .
how about room 644 ?
it' s right across the hall .
sir ?
644 ?
that' s fine .
thank you .
i just need your passport and signature right here , please .
have a nice night .
ja .
berlin polizei .
where ?
brecker hotel .
okay , we' re there .
take the van !
brecker ?
how far ?
about five or six minutes .
hi . !
hey !
congratulations , soldier .
training is over .
polizei . !
polizei . !
go !
black coat , possibly leather , dark t shirt , dark pants .
the cops out there wanna corral all the guests together and check ' em out one by one .
that will really work .
what the hell' s he doing here ?
maybe he just wanted to stay the night .
polizei . !
polizei !
polizei !
polizei . !
polizei . !
polizei !
polizei !
they missed him ?
yeah , so far .
but they found nicky .
she' s back at the westin .
bourne let her go .
he let her go ?
yeah .
where' s danny zorn ?
he ought to head over there and debrief her .
why did bourne come here ?
we don' t know yet .
landy' s upstairs in one of the rooms .
she said she' d call you when she' s done .
okay .
i think i' il , uh ... take a cab back to the hotel .
so , the room he checked into was across the hall .
mmm .
why would he come in here ?
what are you thinking ?
i recognize this room from a photo .
there was a chalk outline right here around the body of vladimir neski .
this is where his wife killed him ?
do you still think his wife killed him ?
guess he got out through this window .
we just got word from the berlin police .
they found danny zorn' s body .
i want you two to stay on bourne .
check everything that' s out there .
call abbott .
tell him to wait for me in his hotel .
i' m coming to see him .
da .
it' s me .
they' re onto neski .
this is not a clean phone .
they can' t prove anything without bourne .
kill bourne , and you kill this investigation .
i' m afraid , ward , the time has come for us to part company .
listen , yuri , you bought those oil leases with 20 million in stolen c. i. a. seed money .
you owe me .
i gave you your cut .
we both got rich .
i don' t owe you anything .
the plan can still be salvaged .
just get bourne .
you hear me ?
he' s still out there .
now get him .
getjason ...
i don' t suppose it would do me much good to cry for help , huh ?
not much .
you killed her .
it was a mistake .
it was supposed to be you .
there were files linking me to the neski murder .
if the files disappeared and they suspected you , they' d be chasing a ghost for 10 years .
so we got in the way .
is that why neski died ?
is that why you killed marie ?
you killed marie ... the minute you climbed into her car .
the minute you entered her life , she was dead .
i told you people to leave us alone .
i fell off the grid .
i was halfway around the world .
there' s no place it won' t catch up to you .
it' s how every story ends .
it' s what you are , jason ... a killer .
you always will be .
go ahead .
go on .
go on . !
do it . !
do it . !
she wouldn' t want me to .
that' s the only reason you' re alive .
i' m a patriot .
i serve my country .
and danny zorn ?
what was he ?
unlucky .
collateral damage .
so , what do we do now ?
i' m not sorry .
no , no , no , forget it .
call me as soon as he' s here .
no , that' s nothing .
good synch up .
who' s this guy ?
platform " b.
go ahead .
go on .
go on . !
do it . !
do it . !
she wouldn' t want me to .
that' s the only reason you' re alive .
got a call from langley .
they' re , uh , going through abbott' s records , and marshall wants to know what' s going on with bourne .
wait , teddy .
teddy , who' s this ?
look at this guy .
he' s about to enter ...

right through there .
that' s bourne .

# extreme ways are back again #
