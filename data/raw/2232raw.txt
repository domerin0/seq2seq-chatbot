ebba grn two years ago , at the park stage back home .

the clash at isstadion or iggy at draken .
it' s kind of hard to choose .
but i prefer small gigs at errol' s .

we met at ...
i' m sorry .
i didn' t mean to wake you .
i' ve got a slight problem .
well , a big problem .
i' ve lost my keys .
i thought i' d ask if i could ...
i only had mulled wine .
that' s alright .
i was at errol' s until they closed
and when i was getting my bag from coat check ...
... my stuff was gone .
i' ve never seen coat check there .
it' s not really coat check , but ...
what ?
never mind .
what' s the song about ?
i meant for it to be a bit like ...
like a kick in the groin of the establishment .
yeah , i can tell .
can i stay here a while ?
i keep fighting with my sister .
sure , you can take the mattress ...
fuck !
you' re heating mulled wine in the oven ?
yeah , the hot plates are busted .
they' re gonna tear this place down .
there' s not even a laundry room .
screw it .
we' re ranked as low as you can get .
below even dogs .
and i only got half of my accommodation allowance .
pigs .
where the hell is sweden headed ?
you have to wonder .
do you sort by name or style ?
preparty , party , after party and weekdays .
hello , what happened here ?
i had to buy it .
we were parodying him in school .
i don' t listen to lundell .
and it just came with an autograph ?
bye , uffe !
if you come back , i' il call the exterminators .
i have to go pee .
hey !
should we start a band ?
of course we should .
when do we start ?
but we really have to go for it .
of course .
how about a single by christmas ?
that sounds awesome .
and no boyfriends .
hell no !
wait ... what did you just say ?
the band always breaks up if someone has a boyfriend .
yeah .
so , for how long ?
until the single is out .
no , i' il just get depressed .
that' s a good thing .
there are no good songwriters who aren' t super depressed .
all the time .
your mind is warped , but okay .
okay .
glrl band seeks drummer punk , garage , no synths
hi , do you have the new herreys album ?
she played the bass for gothenburg' s first girl punk band , svarta ada .
they were great .
how good were they ?
don' t know .
they never released anything .
but they were great .
let' s ask her to play with us .
no !
she' s too big for us .
she' s a legend .
that was a long smoke break .
no matter , we' il deduct it from your paycheck .
try the brand glenn , they' re shorter .
line up those sausages .
i think of him when i screw piffen .
i tried getting him at the christmas party .
he didn' t laugh at a single joke of mine .
no sense of humor .
have you got a light ?
yeah .
how come you' re not in this ugly outfit ?
i just refuse to wear them .
i won' t take any shit .
same here .
i don' t take shit either .
the last time i took shit was at my last job .
and i just told myself that i wasn' t going to take any shit .
and then i stopped .
okay .
what are you listening to ?
my own music .
it' il be out as a single before christmas .
that' s you singing , right ?
you' ve got a good voice .
thanks .
you should write a song about the serfs here at the sausage ...
are you aware you' ve smoked away half the working day now ?
to make up for it , do my laundry .
iron it and fold it .
if you have a sewing machine , fix the yellow pants .
if you don' t have a sewing machine , get one .
got it ?
good .
i' m not the kind of person who likes to be hurtful .
but i have to be honest .
i think it' s kind of lame .
the lyrics are lame , and it' s slow .
you have to mean what you write .
you have to be honest when making music .
i know i am .
we' re supposed to sound like pissed off rabid dogs .
i can' t believe i wrote that .
but i wrote it .
i mean the lyrics .
have you heard that radio show " bommen " ?
let' s send them our demo .
yeah .
millan .
you can' t call here now .
we' re waiting for answers to our ad .

they' re piffen' s .
i can' t play .
i don' t believe you .
that' s his thing .
i' m ...
millan .
i told you you can' t call right now !
we' re waiting for drummers and bass players to call .

hi , it' s me .

the record company got it for me .
they really believe in me .
i' il have a single out by christmas .
i have a girl playing guitar with me , millan .

you little shit !
you' d better apologize !
let' s change our style .
why ?
even the ladies at work have punk hairdos .
it' s not cool anymore .
abra , we can' t change just because some 1 3 year old doesn' t like us .
we have to fight for this .
what about those who do like us ?
take this , hold it out .
cigarettes !
cigarettes !
come on , will you ?
thanks .
could you write your band name on my back ?
our single is out by christmas .

strindberg s playing " bombparty " .
time for the demo of the week , from gothenburg .
the band is called god save the king .

i wrote it real nice .
here' s " fa fa fabriken " .
i have to call my sister .
what are they doing outside , instead of listening to the radio ?

i' il be right there !
relax , damn it !
you can' t come in .
but you look so nice .
alright , come on in .
abra ?
piffen needs to talk for a bit .
he just broke up with his girlfriend , so it' s kind of private .
do you mind sitting in the kitchen ?
the kitchen ?
it' s really sensitive .
he needs someone to talk to .
can' t you guys sit in the kitchen ?
please ?
everything okay ?
yeah .
i' m just taking my clothes .
nothing happened , you know .
can' t you go to the movies ?
oh , fun .
hi .
did you rent the room , or could i ... ?
here you go .
it' s much too big .
that' s ronny , philosophy student , when he can get around to it .
ronny .
hey , ronny !
wake up .
he' s got the clap .
i see .
what a hassle .
i was thinking 500 .
a third of the rent , basically .
it' s a large , airy closet .
and the bed is pretty much unused .
do you want to hear the song ?
what song ?
you said i should write a song about the sausage factory .
who knows , it might be the single b side .
it' s good .
so , what do you think of lundell ?
i guess he' s done some good stuff .
some ?
he' s a damned genius .
thinking about it , some of his stuff is really , really good .
almost gives you goose bumps .
exactly .
this is where i live .
the world' s loneliest job .
lundell wrote his novel " jack " on the same machine .
what , that one ?
no , the same model .
are you writing a book ?
a novel .
i see .
is it difficult ?
no .
it pours out of my fingers onto the keys .
just like that .
it can' t be controlled .
i just can' t find a name for the protagonist' s girlfriend .
abra is a pretty good name .
can i use that ?
sure .
i made it .
hi .
check it out , i got my driver' s license !
man , you' re great .
you did it .
i' m so damned happy .
first try ?
yeah !
abra is here for the room .
hi , i' m karin .
are you going to rent it ?
i haven' t decided yet .
i' m checking out some different places .
we' il see .
i' il call you , if ...
okay .
forget it .
they can' t be there and in our top ten for the third week .
people just love crap .
what' s the point of making music if that' s 1 ?
anyone could write this .
let' s do that , take the money ...
... and then release something good .
you can' t be serious .
like i' d touch a synthesizer .
damn right wing piano .
millan .
yes , that' s me .
okay .
yeah , i know where that is .
we' il be there as soon as we can .
bye .
well , tell me .
tell me !
just a girl answering the ad .
come on .
that' s enough , thank you .
that' s a synthesizer .
the ad said " no synthesizers " .
i have my own pa .
it works great , so we can use that .
i figured we' d experiment and come up with something new .
you could try ... ... gospel punk .
interesting .
or this .
synthesizer punk .
you' re very accomplished .
and i make my own stage outfits .
how about it ?
no thanks .
we' re punk .
great .
great ?
yeah , that' s really great .
what' s your name ?
gloria ?
i' il call you .
millan !
i thought we liked the same music .
she' s got a pa !
what' s the point if the music sucks ?
no synthesizers in our band .
you' re so narrow minded .
i' m honest .
that' s what punk is .
don' t you get it ?
punk will be over before we' ve started .
i don' t give a fuck .
i' m punk , and i will be forever .
how punk is it that piffen decides if you can drum or not ?
give me the key .
you' ve been brainwashed by the right .
and the record contract ?
screw that .
where am i supposed to live ?
millan !
could i sleep here ?
just until millan calms down ?
i don' t think so , because my parents are getting divorced .
hi .
alright , then ...
come on , those are your sausages .
what are you up to ?
what' s going on ?
haven' t i told you about lining them up ?
are you deaf , or just stupid ?
maybe you' re retarded .
what the hell have i done to you ?
i' m not taking more shit from you !
who wants a crappy job like this ?
settle down , abra .
you' re the honest one , but you never mention you hate him too .
i' m an adult .
i don' t need some hitler watching over me .
please sign there .
well , maybe not hitler ...
maybe mussolini ?
if i stained your clothes , i can buy new ones .
i don' t think we share tastes .
what if i apologize ?
i' m not planning to throw sausages at you again .
i wouldn' t do that .
sign it .
please ?
wait !
gothenburg
i have to come with you .
i know you' re there , i can see your feet .
let' s be friends again .
do it now .
i' m too nervous .
she' s huge .
she gets in everywhere .
she could sink us , abra .
hi .
hey there .
do you still play the bass ?
what do you mean ?
didn' t you play with svarta ada ?
yeah .
did you hear us ?
hell yeah .
you were great .
our band needs a bass player .
are you available ?
was that your song on the radio ?
it was pretty good .
how' d you know it was us ?
it' s written on your back .
oh , right .
well ?
i don' t really have time .
i could help you get started .
do you have a drummer ?
no .
yes , we have .
that' s me .
well , there you go .
line up .
the first picture is important .
it always becomes a collector' s item .
alright , look pissed off .
why ?
we' re not a party band .
you can still be happy .
nine out of ten good singles have pissed off sleeves .
you want to go to errol' s ?
i' il get you in .
one more time , one more time !
we' il be up there one day .
i feel sorry for them .
who ?
the roadies , slaving away .
no one likes them .
i have a present for you .
abra ?
it' s my way of thanking you for letting me join the band .
thanks .
does it fit you ?
abra !
you look great !
come out and let me see you .
incredible , abra .
you look great !
turn around .
it looks great .
i was trying for punk when i made it .
it' s really nice .
aren' t you wearing it right away ?
maybe tomorrow .
i have my clothes .
i can take them in my bag .
you can wear it now .
i really don' t think so .
you could at least wear the jacket .
i had to .
i' il make some for you , too .
do you want a drink ?
can' t afford it .
i' m out of work .
the record store needs people .
really ?
i love records .
bar johnny wants you in his office .
why ?
why ?
few get to go there .
he knows music industry people .
go .
hi .
sit down .
did you book tacky tom ?
yeah .
they were really good .
we have a band that ...
don' t talk so much .
you' re cuter when you' re quiet .
people talk so much these days .
i don' t think so .
come on ...
i really don' t think so .
come on .
what were you expecting ?
how do you think i got gigs here ?
i know he' s disgusting .
did he get pissed off ?
is he still in there ?
does isa like me , you think ?
don' t know .
have you seen millan ?
no .
what do you think millan thinks of me ?
she loves you .
so does isa , and i do too .
if you don' t like the jacket , i can make some alterations .
millan ?
millan ?
room for rent cheap , central locatlon
i' m sorry , i was getting something .
do you want tea ?
we were just making some .
no , i just had some .
i don' t drink tea .
good .
i don' t have any .
bye .
bye .
how did it go with dickan ?
it didn' t work out .
doesn' t he have a girlfriend ?
does he ?
the blond one he was with .
that' s his sister karin .
i think this is for the best .
i don' t want him anyway .
i really don' t mind .
i think it' s good we' re not a couple .
were you ever a couple ?
no .
i' d be sad if that was the case .
now i' m happy .
that' s nice .
yes , it' s really nice .
where are my cigarettes ?
did you tidy up in here ?
now i can' t find a thing .
you can t just tidy up without asking .
what if i came to your house and tidied up ?
would you like that ?
seriously , you can' t stay here for the rest of your life .
get a life .
hi .
i' ve made up my mind .
excuse me .
ronny fell asleep over hegel .
you want some wine ?
it' s only ten past two .
we can wait until quarter past .
how' s the single coming ?
have you recorded it yet ?
we haven' t really decided on the song .
and i have writer' s block right now .
i know the feeling .
how old are you ?
twenty two .
just wait until you' re twenty five .
that' s when the demons swoop in .
demons ?
i try to capture that in the novel .
i see .
what' s it about ?
i don' t want to talk too much about it , because that makes it go flat .
but it' s kind of a novel to define a generation .
is her name still abra ?
what ?
you wanted my name for the book .
right .
exactly .
a toast to your novel getting up there .
and for my band too .
up there ?
up there .
they' re going up there .
well , look at it .
i am looking .
hi , it' s me .
i' ve moved in with a guy .
yeah , he' s a writer .
he' s really in love with me .
is he writing a book about you ?
yes .
never mind , forget it .
want to hear a new song ?
abra , not in here .
it' s just so beautiful .
want to know what i think ?
it' s kind of lame .
didn' t you hate ballads ?
no , you did .
no , it was you .
and no boyfriend before the record .
you don' t think we' re a couple ?
you don' t get it .
when do i get the rent money ?
you' re behind .
i' il start adding interest soon .
hey .
i got us a gig that might lead to a tv spot .
bar johnny knows a tv producer whose sister is getting married .
that' s huge .
huge ?
not really .
the pay sucks , but if it gets us on tv , that could lead to a record deal .
record deal ?
does anyone have a car ?
it' s kind of far away .
i don' t even have a license .
i don' t have a license it' s matter of principle .
i can be a trainee driver in three months .
interesting .
is anyone taking notes ?
abra , don' t be nice to guys with bad taste in music .
they might as well go elsewhere .
he bought some bowie .
it' s pronounced " bauey " .
early bowie is fine , but not " let' s dance " .
i' il keep that in mind .
good .
you do know how to get pocket money , right ?
i mean how to steal from the till .
but roffe' s right there .
he doesn' t notice anything , as stoned as he is .
flip this one over , so the customer doesn' t see the total
then you punch in 50 instead of 59 , and split the difference for yourself .
i don' t think so .
give it a shot .
i' ve been paid .
do you want some wine ?
i have two bottles .
so , it' s not supposed to rhyme ?
no .
that song was really good .
when can i read your book ?
it' s hard to say when it' il be done .
it' s a process .
a painful process .
it' s a bit more complex than just writing a song .
not that writing a song is easy .
i didn' t mean that .
does abra fall for anyone in the book ?
so , how old are you ?
why do you ask ?
how old are you ?
twenty two .
you' re lying .
no , i' m not .
your id says you' re nineteen .
did you go through my wallet ?
that' s low !
abra !
dickan , i was going to rent a video player .
want to chip in ?
lend me your car , ronny .
wait , wait , wait !
so , what was the point of this song ?
i guess we wanted it to be a boil on the ass of the establishment .
at a wedding ?
a boil on the ass ?
that' s gross .
i think the song' s great .
especially the lyric .
and who wrote that ?
that would be me .
seriously , here' s some advice : drop the punk thing .
it' s dead .
record companies want new stuff .
then i' m out .
i have a new song .
and change the name .
god save the king ?
how about lola wants to dance ?
no ?
alright then .
next item : who' s going to call abf ?
you call them , say that we' re a study group of six or so .
and then we get money .
it' s for equipment , but we' il just split it .
how does your song sound , gloria ?
really great song , gloria .
thank you .
wait a second .
are we some party band now ?
i won' t have that .
then look for another band .
sorry .
i didn' t mean it that way .
right .
it' s not like i asked him to pick me up .
maybe he means me .
wait .
i have to give him the key .
i forgot .
is that her boyfriend ?
no , she just lives with him .
he' s nuts .
he' s writing a book about her .
okay ...
you know , i ...
i don' t usually go through people' s wallets .
i' m sorry .
did you wait here for three hours ?
you' re not allergic , i hope .
hey there .
i have kind of a weird question .
could you drive us to a gig on saturday ?
not a problem .
i probably should leave you alone .
isa !
don' t mention it to millan .
don' t tell millan anything about us .
that' s got to be the tv producer .
hi , i' m stefan bergwall .
toastmaster , brother of the bride .
i' m not in the band .
i' m the driver .
so , who runs the show ?
that would be me .
hi .
oh .
i thought i' d booked a regular band .
are you going to look like that ?
don' t you have stage clothes ?
yeah , but we' il change into them later .
i' m not dressing up for some upper class wedding .
he' s a tv producer .
yeah , come on .
you can sit in the kitchen until you go on .
the kitchen ?
what the fuck ?
that' s fine thank you .
why are we in the kitchen ?
rock bands deserve a dressing room .
look what the staff lent me .
they might not be the right size ...
maybe i can find a sewing machine .
please , no sewing now .
dearest bride and groom , dearest friends .
time for some live music , but first ... what was it ?
oh , right !
drinks can be bought in the bar .
we have a bucket there where you can put money for the honeymoon .
and now , time for some live music .
featuring the orchestra molly wants to dance .
come on !
hello .
could you please ...
could you ... ?
thanks .
how about playing something we know ?
don' t you know any hit songs ?
no .
house of the rising sun ?
no .
sweet home alabama ?
sorry .
not house of the rising sun ...
how about johnny b. goode ?
we should know that .
good , let' s do it .
