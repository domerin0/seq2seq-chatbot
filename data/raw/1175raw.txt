yeah .

no .
name' s ted .
what is that , a polaris ?
oh , yeah !
what do those things go for ?
a lot more than i could normally afford , i tell you .
what' s that ?
it' s a video camera .
hey , is that thing heavy ?
yeah .
and you got it in there by yourself ?
how' s that on your back ?
oh , no .
oh , please !
turn the camera off !
ted !
oh , that' s not nice !
that was really cool .
it was like watching " cops " .
yeah ?
well , he was pretty spry for a man with a herniated disk .
you know , i don' t want to bitch or anything , but you were supposed to take me along on that one .
couldn' t find you .
i know you know this but the sooner they think i can handle things on my own , the sooner they' il kick you back down south .
yeah , well , i' ve been hearing that for thirteen months and six days , cam .
after a while , it gets a little old .
claims .
watters .
yeah .
okay .
that' s quite the fish .
that one didn' t get away .
yeah , well ... it' s a nice catch .
this grasshopper walks in a bar . and the bartender says , " we have a drink named after you .
and the grasshopper says ...
paul barnell .
ted watters .
mr. watters .
pleasure .
mine , too .
ted , mr. barnell would like to discuss his brother' s life insurance policy with us .
raymond , right ?
yes .
thing is , as i explained to mr. branch , he' s been gone for five years and i thought , time to move on .
by move on , you mean ?
i mean ...
i think that cashing raymond' s policy .
i doubt , after that time , that he' s still alive .
and my father always wanted us to take care of each other if something should happen , and ... money is a little ...
yeah , i understand , mr. barnell .
but here' s the thing .
with no actual body , under alaskan statutes , a person has to be missing for seven years before he or she can be legally declared dead .
and that' s not withstanding an investigation period where concerned parties can take up to another year to file interventions concerning the motion .
so , even though your brother' s status is undetermined at this point , there' s really very little we can do for you .
but we are extremely sorry for your loss .
absolutely .
one , two , three ...
all right .
we' il get him later .
yes , this is mr. barnell .
mr. barnell , this is john hoag again from municipal power' s delinquent accounts department .
excuse me ?
i' m sorry , mr. barnell ,
i' ve tried every other option and , frankly , this is unavoidable .
great .
excuse me ?
no , i' m not ...
hello ?
hello ?
yeah .
i paid that bill a week ago .
you did ?
i saw my secretary write it up .
do you have any idea where that payment might be ?
i have no clue .
i' m a patient man , mr. barnell but your credit rating is blocked off .
i have a very good credit rating .
no , you don' t .
how do you know that ?
i' ve got your trw file in front of me , sir .
mr. barnell ?
mr. barnell ?
hello ?
mr. barnell ?
hey , kids , who' s up for trout ?
no .
jodie , no !
not for dogs !
honey , i' m home !
any mail ?
psychic pals .
how are you today , mr. williams ?
well , we are all registered psychics here .
hi , tiff .
i just had this feeling you needed to talk .
so what' s up ?
your tv remote control ?
well , i need you to clear your mind for a few moments .
it' s stew .
i don' t think it' s still good .
hey , aren' t you with a customer ?
they' re concentrating .
how is he the tea leaf business today ?
i' ve decided , from now on , to ignore you and your ignorance about my work .
and it' s going very well , thank you .
mr. williams ?
i' m seeing sofa cushions .
do you have a sofa ?
good !
glad i could help .
okay , before you say anything else that may keep us from having sex ever again
iet me ask you something .
no , i always get these wrong .
that' s why we keep trying .
i don' t want to do this .
love is sacrifice quiz .
if you were in a life raft with me , and there was only enough water for one ...
no , i' m not going to do it .
it' s just a stupid quiz .
exactly .
what is that ?
i was just kidding .
psychic pals .
is this the first time you' ve called us , mrs ...
stupid quizzes can be illustrative of potential relationship problems .
margaret , i' m getting the feeling this is an anxious day for you .
hey , you know our only relationship problem is that you' re running a dollar , ninety nine a minute carny scam out of my living room .
don' t call it a scam .
wait you didn' t just call this " your " living room , did you ?
ours .
margaret , i feel someone you really care about , maybe even the love of your life is being a real pain .
now , i need you to really concentrate and i' il be right back .
i thought stuff didn' t smell when it was frozen .
i don' t know why we have to ...
' cause dave wants visual confirmation .
so dave gets visual confirmation .
we have a chance to move up here , gary , so let' s just do what we' re told .
what' s he gonna do , have him stuffed ?
like the guy' s not gonna end up in a landfill anyway .
you ever ask dave what he did ?
who knows .
but dave said if he did it one more time , he was gonna break his neck .
so how did it feel ?
i mean , not when you did it , but like now .
i don' t want to talk about it .
okay .
jimbo !
he' s not here .
gary , enough with the little jokes , okay ?
i' m serious .
he' s gone .
don' t even joke about it .
maybe he wasn' t ... dead .
hey , jimbo !
there' s a little fridge down here .
morning , mr. barnell .
morning , avis .

she looks good .
waikiki airlines , your ticket to paradise .

if we didn' t have the weather , what would we talk about ?
yeah .
messages ?
just that fellow from municipal power and electric .
i told him you sent the check in weeks ago , but some people don' t like to listen .
sorry , what did you say ?
avis , something really spooky happened last night .
you remember my brother raymond ?
the one who went missing ?
well , last night there was a knock at the door and behold , there was raymond on my doorstep .
didn' t you have him declared .
dead ?
well , no ... yes .
well , he was n' tgone long enough really for that .
good thing .
in hindsight .
so ... where was he all these years ?

thank you so much for clearing the driveway .
that was real considerate .
well , i don' t know what you' re talking about , mrs. wherry .
you were out at the cabin this morning ?
nice to see you getting some use out of that thing .
oh , now i see .
no , no , that was raymond you saw out there .
he' s alive ?
yeah , very much .
oh , god .
come on !
how much easier do i have to make this ?
margaret , you scared the wits out of me .
look at the dog .
she' s just a little puppy .
a little puppy she is .
little hungry puppy .
a hungry , hungry puppy .
yes .
yes , she is .
come on over here .
well .
how late is rudy' s open ?
i' m sorry about this part .
thank you .
if it' s any comfort , he likely wasn' t eaten while conscious .
so it was the fall ?
did he say where he was living before he came ?
florida .
he didn' t talk about it much .
he brought us this shell .
it' s all we have left , really .
hadn' t seen him for five years .
we' d given him up for ...
for dead , yes , sir .
how did you ... ?
anonymous phone tip from some jamaican ... guy .
jamaican ?
he said he saw what he thought was a body .
we tracked you through his ld .
just like on tv .
i have to see him .
mr. barnell , i have to warn you , an animal attack isn' t pretty .
i know .
there' s not much left .
oh , god .
is that your brother , sir ?
yeah .
that' s him .
chewed his ears off .
what kind of animal does something like that ?
normally , i' d say a bear .
but with these tracks and the feeding pattern , indicate wolf .
it' s rare , but it can happen .
your brother' s personal effects .
marcy , would you ...
yeah , no problem .
come on , let' s go this way .
thank you .
coroner found some smaller bite marks on the ankle .
pups .
must have been the whole freaking pack .
derek found this .
not the smartest snack for a hiker .
messy animals , aren' t they ?
messy .
messy , messy , messy , messy .
here ya go , say cheese !
cheese !
shit !
you know , there are some places on this planet where people actually do this outside .
so how many insurance companies are there in the united states ?
like a billion .
that' s not the point , tiffany .
that' s not the point , tiffany .
i busted my ass for liberty capital , all right ?
i don' t want to quit .
i want to be promoted .
i want to be promoted out of this icebound backwater .
okay .
and when that happens , i guess i' il just be another notch on your briefcase .
i can' t believe you just said that .
well , you know that you' re the most most important thing in my life .
sorry , what was that ?
you wanna take me right here ?
tiffany , what do you want ... ?
you gonna get that ?
psych ... i' m sorry , hello ?

yeah ?
look , is this a matter of life and death ?
because ...
tiff , give me the phone .
yeah .
hello ?
you' re kidding .
your mom ?
a million dollar life policy just checked .
on a saturday ?
what about the first annual golf , sex and pizza triathlon ?
look , tiffany , if this is who i think it is
i may have found us a ticket out of here , so ...
we don' t need a ticket .
yeah , can i call you back ?
okay .
we ... i mean ...
don' t be late , okay ?
you won' t even know i' m gone .
that' s him .
raymond barnell .
so , what' s your line on this ?
just what it looks like .
wolves got him .
maybe a grizzly with insomnia , but i couldn' t find any tracks .
well , would it surprise you to learn that his brother tried to cash in his policy not two weeks ago ?
what are you trying to tell me that mr. barnell chewed off his brother' s leg ?
well , doesn' t it make you the least bit suspicious that maybe ...
mr. watters , i don' t know thing one about insurance ... but i' m guessing it' s your job to find a way not to pay these poor people .
this is a nice , simple ending .
we like nice , simple endings .
chief ?
good news , bad news .
the good news , he' s dead .
bad news , he disappeared .
proof , jimbo .
you got one week .
it was our first time .
nobody gets it perfect their first time , dave .
mr. branch , this is not a standard case .
you were there when the guy came in and tried to cash in .
i mean , come on .
it stinks .
watters , if the police say that this guy was ...
eaten by wolves , sir . ... eaten by wolves , then we' ve got no case .
did you happen to see mr. barnell on the news last night ?
the police told us what happened .
how are you folks holding up ?
well , my wife is too upset to be here .
paul ?
who' s out there ?
as i said , she' s very upset .
paul ?
the door' s stuck .
it' s tough , though , ' cause you have to ask yourself ...
who fucked with the fucking door ?
you see how stressful his has been .
i have to go now because we have a service to plan .
excuse me .
hi .
well , what we don' t need is bad pr .
i don' t want this thing valdezing on us .
mr. branch i' m sure that head office would take a rather dim view of our approach to ...
corporate' s view will be what i tell them .
okay .
yes , sir .
color us " called off " as of now .
thanks , cam .
thanks a lot .
thanks for , all the back up .
you got a strange way of bucking for a promotion , my friend .
look , i' m gonna start on the johnson file .
you wanna do up the paperwork on barnell ?
where you going ?
lunch .
at nine thirty ?
yeah .
we got seven joints here .
we got a card place , we got a great escape travel , hair joint .
which one you figure' d wanna take our friend ?
the police say they found raymond' s wallet and that' s how they tracked you down .
yes , that' s right .
any idea what he was doing out there ?
he' d take walks .
hikes .
hiking .
how sporty .
can i get you a cup of coffee ?
no , thank you .
was he a big hiker ?
i' m sorry , i don' t follow .
well , would he hike more than once a week or was this just a one time thing ?
may i ask why you need to know all this ?
just trying to tie up some loose ends , mr. barnell .
you know , the police they say my brother died in the attack .
now , you do cover that sort of thing , don' t you ?
yes , sir , mr. barnell , and it shouldn' t take more than a few days .
now , can you uh , can you tell me a little bit more about your brother ?
the hiker ?
how is my princess ?
what' s up ?
i took some adavan .
and called my psychic .
you know we can' t afford that .
we talked about that .
okay .
don' t be mad .
it' s just this week has been so ...
i know .
i know .
well , with raymond getting eaten by animals and someone trying to steal the fridge .
we got another letter from the hmo today .
hey , come on now .
come on .
i' m sorry .
fucking cocksuckers .
as we previously stated in the genetic history ...
i' m sick .
i' m really , really sick , you know ?
i know .
tourette' s syndrome is not easily diagnosed .
no ...
fuck , fuck ! " ... onset before the age of 1 8 and no genetic history ...
please reference our previous discussions ... " " ... concerning you claims for ... " " ... ocd , odd , adhp ...
it' s what' s going down at the beginning of the century .
margaret !
but still in matters vegetable , animal and mineral ...
i am the very model of a modern major general .
margaret !
i know you don' t like to talk about this .
but maybe it' s not what we think it is , you know ?
yeah , maybe it' s not .
maybe it' s just stress .
remember that cruise ?
i saw you .
you were happy .
you were this sweet , happy person .
kind and giving .
i' m sorry .
i' m tired , you know .
they say you can' t get it all of a sudden , but i did .
i really , really did .
i know .
i know .
well , i' il kill myself .
no , come on , that' s nonsense !
then they' il see .
no , that' s nonsense talk .
come here .
no , come on now . ... marry someone normal .
you' re the most normal girl i know .
i' m not crazy , paul .
there' s something wrong with me .
i know , sweetie .
and we' re gonna find the best specialists for what you have we can .
really ?
yeah .
i know things are gonna turn around .
call me cra ... i got this feeling .
i do .
but you have to leave everything up to me , okay ?
you leave everything up to me , and you' re gonna be okay .
i promise .
shit bag .
that' s my girl .
yeah , hi .
this is ted watters from liberty capital .
i was wondering if i could get a complete credit workup on a raymond barnell and a paul barnell , as well .
yes , i will hold .
you start the month ends yet ?
oh , can you take care of that for me ?
i' m kinda working on something here , cam .
oh , god .
you' re not still on the barnell thing , are you ?
i went to go see him .
and ?
and ?
so , trust me , something' s not right .
i can smell it .
just help me buy a week .
we' re gonna get in such trouble .
okay , from now on , you can come along with me on everything .
no more cam goes to the coffee room and ted disappears for three hours ?
i' il try , yeah .
and you' il work on your interpersonal skills ?
yes .
good .
now , if you' il excuse me , i' il go start covering your ass .
oh , hi .
yeah , sorry .
are all these yours ?
greatest sport on earth .
moved to a compound bow two years ago .
arthritis .
less draw weight .
tea okay ?
oh , yeah , yeah .
yeah , i' m fine .
thank you .
i was just wondering , did you happen to talk to raymond when he got back ?
only saw him the once .
never spoke to him .
waved to him .
you waved ?
he was clearing my driveway .
raymond was a real hellcat when he was younger .
but like they say , time mellows even the hardest soul .
was he much of an outdoo rsman or ahiker or ... ?
i thought it was paul at first .
have you talked to paul' s wife ?
now there' s a story .
not that i' m much of a one for gossip , but i think that ...
i' m sorry .
did you say you thought it was paul that did your driveway ?
okay .
it turns out that mr. barnell is mortgaged to the nuts .
his business is about one step away from chapter 1 1 .
plus , it' s like his brother raymond never even existed .
there' s no credit history , there' s no nothing for the last five years .
plus the only thing he did after hisrecent reappearance ... was get some new ld and a new credit card , but he didn' t charge anything .
less than nothing .
okay , well , it' s something .
no , it' s not .
yes , it is .
no , it' s not .
claims , watters .
this is personal .
i promise .
mr. barnell , your ears must have been burning .
i was just ...
oh , yeah , sure , yeah .
what time ?
why is god , who is a loving god , capable of such things ?
when someone is taken from us at such a young age , we often ourselves why .
bullshit .
what possible purpose could this serve ?
but i believe the apostle paul , writing to the ephesians , said it best when he said " all things are done according to god' s will .
nun banger .
doggies !
raymond barnell , barnell' s travel .
we should have seen it earlier .
we should have checked the funeral announcements right away .
mr. barnell , there was really no hurry on this .
i mean ... we could' ve waited until later .
we just wrapped up .
this is my wife , margaret .
sweetheart , why don' t you go sit in the car and warm up , okay ?
okey dokey , smokey .
she' s been under a lot of stress lately .
i notice the media' s here .
they really don' t give people a moment' s peace , do they ?
i called them .
really ?
they wanted to talk to me about raymond , and i thought now would be an appropriate time .
and you' il just happen to mention your heartless insurance company that hasn' t paid off your policy yet .
i had to borrow money to pay for this coffin , mr. ted .
well , you' re breaking my heart , mr. barnell .
i doubt that .
they asked to see some personal photos of raymond .
guess this is gonna be a really big story .
maybe if we walked over there together and you told them how deeply moved you were by this tragedy .
enjoy your press conference , mr. barnell .
raymond left us this shell .
it' s all we have to remember him by , really .
hello , little bambi .
where' s your mommy ?
getting it from some ten point buck .
yes , she is .
she is ...
stay away from our fucking appliances !
okay , lady , let' s just stay calm .
sorry .
son of a bitch .
you are in so much trouble !
lady , so help me ...
let' s go again .
let' s go ... again .
okay , sir ...
in the house !
so you' re a souvenir wholesaler ?
for the cruise ship trade , mostly .
usual stuff ... stuffed animals .
you got your huskies , your moose your baby seals ... your bears , your ...
is that where they came in ?
yeah , through that big hole in the roof .
i got a list of all the things that are missing .
how much ?
we figure about two hundred grand .
plus fixing the roof .
fax over an estimate and we' il have you a check by friday .
ted ?
maybe we should take a look at the irinventory list first .
this is a simple case .
bad guys stole stuff .
let' s just clear it and get going , okay ?
i should tell you , we also had some vcrs we were holding for another company .
that could run another couple grand .
wanna wrap this up , cam ?
gotta go primary sometime !
you try to rape me , i swear to christ , i' il bite it off .
hey , what' s going on ?
don' t ask !
what the hell happened to your face ?
jesus , you look like you ran into ...
so what now , you gonna get me smoking from both ends ?
i just came here to look around and she started hitting me and yelling at me .
oh , please .
is this how you solve our problem ?
i didn' t have any choice .
just listen to me , okay ?
yeah , listen .
if the fat from your neck hasn' t stopped up your ears .
where would we stash her ?
your place ?
no , it' s too small .
plus , we' d have to get her in and out without anyone seeing .
and i' ve seen that sty you call an apartment .
you see , it' s a bad idea .
they got a whirlpool tub .
with bubbles ?
it' d be like a little getaway .
hey maggie magster .
you' re awfully ...
what the hell happened ?
what the hell are you doing in our house ?
mr. barnell .
i believe you have something that belongs to us .
i don' t know what you' re talking about .
you don' t ?
you hear that , gary ?
he don' t know what we' re talking about .
guess he doesn' t know nothing about a ... dead body in the dumpster at his place of employment .
so how much did you get ?
we had a life insurance policy on my brother and we could get ... one hundred thousand dollars .
you know , it' s always you quiet guys .
all right , here' s how it' s gonna work .
we stay here with your little tulip in there and you go get our guy .
you stay here ?
have the body and let' s say fifty thousand clams for our trouble .
you screw with us and we' il start mailing your wife back to you .
starting with her feet .
paul !
are you moving in ?
just for a bit .
she' il come to her senses .
they always do .
thanks , mrs. wherry .
good night .
oh , raymond .
would it have killed you to clean up before you left ?
state police !
open up !
police ?
is there something wrong ?
hello , brother .
missed ya .
page sixteen , paul .
you know what i love about usa today , other than the bar graphs and the colored pictures ?
they got news from every state in the union .
i was eaten by wild fucking animals !
but you know , despite that , i' m feeling pretty goddamn chipper .
let me tell you what' s going on here , raymond .
so where' s my money ?
your money ?
there' s no money yet .
they' re still investigating .
what' d you get ?
fifty thousand .
i get half .
sure .
you look good .
you lost weight .
i gave up carbs .
i' m getting a health kick .
what you doing out here , anyway ?
she not going along with it ?
who , margaret ?
how' s she holding up , anyway ?
we' re having problems .
any kids ?
you still can' t get one past the goalie , huh ?
well , it' s best not to send a boy to do a man' s job .
so how come you talk like you do ?
i mean , cursing all the time .
it' s a disease .
it' s called tourette' s syndrome .
i can' t control what i say .
turnip .
really ?
congratulations .
you' ve just kidnapped a handicapped person .
i saw on tv where people with that don' t usually curse .
they must have got it wrong .
i don' t think so .
it was a movie of the week based on real events .
and don' t people with tourette' s usually twitch and stuff ?
i get it .
sorry .
you got a spice rack ?
next to the stove .
what' s that supposed to mean ?
nothing .
cumin ?
there .
there .
there .
there , there , there , there , there , there !
and i' m not crazy .
it' s a physical disease .
sometimes i can control it , and sometimes ... i can' t .
you can' t .
you know what i think ?
i think this syndrome is something you read about somewhere and figured ...
hey , works for me .
ass .
ass .
ass .
you can completely abdicate your societal responsibilities .
say whatever want whenever you want , and slough it off on an illness .
ass rimming ball sucker .
maybe i should catch this thing .
gee , sorry , your honor ,
i have this disease that makes me rob 7 elevens .
it' s called i really need a slurpee disease .
you' ve never robbed a 7 1 1 in your life you shit eating fuck weasel .
what kind of a man threatens a woman with a gun , anyway ?
you are so faking it .
you should know .
is this how you get your kicks , you overcompensating pussy little fart sack ?
you better shut your mouth or i' m gonna stick this gun right in it !
you don' t scare me .
if something bad was gonna happen , my psychic would have told me .
you put that down now , you little bitch , or so help me i' il start yelling so loud , you' il have to shoot me .
a little help here ?
i got twinkies .
honey ?
you okay ?
wait , this is the important part .
wait , wait , wait , wait .
this stops now .
i was watching that .
this case is making me and you crazy .
especially you .
i' m just trying to be supportive .
leading experts agree that' s the number one complaint men had about their mates .
i don' t have any complaints about my , you .
dead guy' s got a record ?
yeah , he beat some guy up in a bar fight .
he broke the guy' s eye socket .
honey ?
yeah .
i think you should look at this again .
okay .
you know , i' ve been thinking there , paulie .
after we get her back from these guys who grabbed her do you think your wife' s gonna be able to keep her pretty little mouth shut ?
that' d be a first .
' cause , you know , crazy people talk a lot and ...
she' s not ...
... and i' m told that if you say something to your therapist , they can use that in a courtroom .
we can' t afford a therapist , raymond .
still , you just might want to think about it .
think about what ?
all i' m saying is , sometimes a man has to make problematic decisions .
cull the herd , so to speak .
come on , paulie , i' m just i' m just fuckin ' with you .

mr. watters .
on the phone you said something about a resolution to our claim ?
mr. barnell , why are you staying out here ?
my wife and i we' re having a few problems .
well , that' s kind of understandable , seeing as how you killed that man and dumped his body out in the middle of the woods .
raymond ?
no , no , no .
definitely not raymond .
i thought it was at first , but that' s what was throwing me .
i don' t think i appreciate your tone , sir .
my tone ?
mr. barnell , you are going to jail .

my wife ...
do you think it' s okay to do something kinda bad to someone even though they may do something to someone else that' s really bad ?

he said he was joking , but i think he might do them .
okay , well , don' t think , know .

have you ever felt like
iike your own life didn' t even matter as long as

yeah .
there' s a turnout up at summit hill where the snowmobilers park .

how would she know ?
i coulda had her , you know ?
we both know that .
right ?
oh , yeah , yeah , i just figured she was ...

yeah , well , we' il go get her and do the thing , and ...
you remember that time in school when i jumped out and scared you and you fucking peed all over yourself ?
that was a hoot , yeah .
hey , bottoms up .
okay .
puddles !
you remember how everybody called you " puddles " ?
everybody called you " puddles " .
they did .
puddles !
yeah , that was funny .
hey , come on now .
there you go , there you go .
i love you , bro .
you too , pal .
okay .
it' s my tub !
open up !
finders keepers .
no , i drew the water !
get out !
finders keepers .
get out of here .
you know this thing has twelve different settings ?
no , gary i don' t .
every time i try to get in it , somebody else is already there .
stop that !
hey , let me ask you something .
does this look normal ?
oh , christ !
i read that if it changes color , you should have it looked at .
yeah ... but not by me !
hello ?
oh , thank fucking christ !
is tiffany there ?
no , well , she' s gonna be back in a couple of minutes .
do you want to call back later ?
well , you should know , fuckwit .
do you know there' s a man with a gun in my bathroom right now ?
goddamnit , ted .
oh , wait , yeah , she' s right here .
one second .
mrs. barnell ?
i' m here , margaret .
how' re you feeling today ?
give me the headset .
what is wrong with you ?
christ !
where do you want to start ?
mrs. barnell could you speak up a bit ?
what' s she saying ?
something about the gay mafia taking her to a park to kill her ?
margaret , now are you sure that these are real people in your house ?
shit on toast .
jesus !
fucking dog .
watch out for jodie .
how do you like the bubbles now ?
you want to squeak your duck again ?
jesus !
that really hurts , you know ?
good !
why are the flowers talking ?
are you sure this is it ?
she specifically mentioned the cocksucking turnout off the highway where the snowmobilers like to hang out .
i' il call you later , okay ?
i won' t be here .
excuse me ?
i know relationships aren' t gonna be all sunshine and roses , but i' m not really having that much fun anymore , and i don' t think you are , either .
what are you talking about ?
i just i think you need to be like this right now , and i' m not in a good space to deal with it .
so , what ?
i just , i don' t think we should be like this together .
psychic pals .
how are you today , mr. williams ?
i think she' d be fine with you re marrying .
but hang on , let me concentrate ...
i' ve been ... i' ve been cutting you out of my life and , as a result , our normal communication channels have been blocked .
and i think that you coming with me would further the development of our relationship and allow us both to realize the ... the potential of our interpersonalism .
if you' re gonna be sarcastic ...
i' m not being anything .
okay .
why do you want me to come ?
because if you don' t , then ... then i' il have to stay .
and then , then i' il be mad about that .
and then , and then i know that we' il eventually break up over it .
and as bad as my life is right now , tiffany , that would make it a million times worse .
mr. williams ?
you know , she' s totally cool with it .
listen , listen , you' re gonna have to call back .
i gotta go help my boyfriend .
see this ?
this has all the symptoms of that tourette' s thing ... and you don' t have half of them .
and ?
and ... and you' re faking it .
magazines don' t prove anything .
could we please get ther e in some peace and quiet ?
magazines prove everything .
don' t make me pull the car over .
okay , so it' s called the listening game .
you talk , i listen , and i can' t interrupt .
then we switch .
i can talk about anything ?
yes .
let' s just drop it , okay ?
i' m just saying , she acts like this ' cause you always take her side !
that little prick !
i assume you have our friend ?
of course .
can you let her go now ?
let' s see our guy first .
how do we know it' s him ?
come on !
where would i get another one ?
you got the money , mack ?
so , this is kinda like a really weird " law and order " episode .
and if paul barnell already killed his brother ...
yeah , maybe his wife is next .
okay , so my turn ?
yeah .
now , a healthy relationship ...
here we are .
can i let her out ?
no !
step away from the car !
why did you gag her ?
you know .
it' s all over .
did they hurt you ?
no , no , no ...
you don' t look so good .
have you been eating ?
yeah , i' ve been .
you ?
did they feed you ?
did you drink too much coffee ?
no , you know , when i get busy .
you know .
did you fall ?
yeah , but ... chipped a tooth .
we' il fix that when we get home .
boy , you look good .
you smell nice .
yeah .
musty .
how' s jodie ?
she' s dead .

so , do you have a plan here ?
you know , i guess i' m gonna
i' m gonna go talk to him .
yeah .
you don' t mind staying here , do sure .
wait .
when do we call the cops ?
you know , i mean , if he is doing something then , i' il just ,
i' il wave , okay ?
that' s a very good plan .
tourists .
wait isn' t ... isn' t that ?
what ?
excuse me !
excuse me !
aren' t you raymond barnell ?
go away .
hey , you know , i don' t really know what' s going on here , but i was just wondering if maybe you could come with me to my office just for a few minutes .
i mean ...
hey , man , you know , i don' t wanna screw with your life , but you can' t just walk away with a million dollars and expect people to be like , " hey , yeah , thanks a lot pal .
how much ?
your brother , and i use this term very carefully has stolen a million doll ars from my insurance company ...
for years i' ve been thinking new meds ....
you know , maybe we should ...

and when you love someone
i mean , really love someone ...

i would go to the mall , mr. barnell !
the listening game .

i wanted to help margaret , you know ?
i' m broke and that' s why i came in originally with that insurance policy thinking ,
