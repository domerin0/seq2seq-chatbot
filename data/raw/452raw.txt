forward , forward , march forward .
make for the lower ground .
stay together !
bring your pretty face to my axe !
that one counts as mine !
stinking creature !
aragorn !
tell me what happened and i will ease your passing
he' s dead ....
he took a little thumble off the cliff .
you lie !
get the wounded on horses .
the wolfs of isengard will return .
leave the dead .
come .
finally !
helm' s deep !
there it is , helm' s deep !
we' re saved , my lady !
thank you !
momma !
freda !
make way for the king !
so few .
so few of you have returned .
our people are safe .
we have paid for it with many lives .
my lady .
lord aragorn ... ... where is he ?
he fell .
draw all our forces behind the wall .
bar the gate and set a watch on the surround .
what of those who cannot fight my lord ?
the women and children ?
get them into the caves .
saruman' s arm would have grown long indeed if he thinks he can reach us here .
helm' s deep has but one weakness .
it' s outer wall is solid rock for ... ... for a small culvert in space ... ... which is little more than a drain .
how ?
how can fire undo stone ?
what kind of device can break down a wall ?
if the wall is breached , helm' s deep will fall .
even if it is breached , it would take a number beyond reckoning , thousands to storm the keep .
tens of thousands .
but , my lord , there is no such force .
a new power is rising .
it' s victory is at hand .
this night ... ... the land will be stained with the blood of rohan !
march to helm' s deep !
leave none alive !
to war !
there will be no dawn for men .
look !
the smoke to the south !
there is always smoke rising up ... ... from isengard these days .
isengard ?
there was a time ... ... when saruman would walk in my woods .
but now , he has a mind of metal ... ... and wheels .
he no longer cares for growing things .
what is it ?
it' s saruman' s army !
the war has started .
may the grace of the valar protect you .
arwen .
it is time .
the ships are leaving for valinor .
go now before it is too late .
i' ve made my choice .
he is not coming back .
why do you linger here when there is no hope ?
there is still hope .
if aragorn survives this war , you will still be parted .
if sauron is defeated and aragorn made king ... ... and all that you hoped for comes true ... ... you will still have to taste the bitterness of mortality ...
whether by the sword or the slow decay of time .... ...
aragorn will die .
and there will be no comfort for you .
no comfort to ease the pain of his passing .
he will come to death .
an image of the splendor of the kings ... ... of men in glory , undimmed before the breaking of the world .
but you , my daughter ... ... you will linger on in darkness and in doubt ...
as night falling winter has come without a star .
here you will dwell ... ... bound to you grief , under the fading trees ... ... until all the world has changed ... ... and the long years of your life are utterly spent .
arwen .
there is nothing for you here ... ... only death .
do i not also have your love ?
you have my love father .
the power of the enemy is growing .
sauron will use his puppet saruman ... ... to destroy the people of rohan .
isengard ... ... has been unleashed .
the eye of sauron now turns to gondor ... ... the last free kingdom of men .
his war on this country will come swiftly .
he senses the ring is close .
the strength of the ringbearer is failing .
in his heart , frodo begins to understand .
the quest will claim his life .
you know this .
you have foreseen it .
it is the risk we all took .
in the gathering dark , the will of the ring grows strong .
it works hard now to find its way back into the hands of men .
men , who are so easily seduced by its power .
the young captain of gondor has but to extend his hand ... ... to take the ring for his own and the world will fall .
he is close now .
so close to achieving his goal .
for sauron will have dominion over all life on this earth ... ... even until the ending of the world .
the time of the elves ... ... is over .
do we leave middle earth to this fate ?
do we let them stand alone ?
what news ?
our scouts report saruman has attacked rohan .
theoden' s people have fled to helm' s deep .
but we must look to our own borders .
faramir , orcs are on the move .
sauron is marshalling an army .
easterlings and southrons are passing through the black gate .
how many ?
some thousands .
more come every day .
who' s covering the river to the north ?
we pulled five hundred men out of osgiliath .
but if the city is attacked , we won' t hold it .
saruman attacks from isengard .
sauron from mordor .
the fight will come to men on both fronts .
gondor is weak .
sauron will strike us soon .
and he will strike hard .
he knows now we do not have the strength to repel him .
my men tell me that you are orc spies .
spies !
now wait just a minute !
well if you' re not spies , then who are you ?
speak !
we are hobbits of the shire .
frodo baggins is my name and this is samwise gamgee .
your bodyguard ?
his gardener .
and where is your skulking friend ?
that gangrel creature .
he had an ill favoured look .
there was no other .
we set out from rivendell with seven companions .
one we lost in moria .
two were my kin .
a dwarf there was also .
and an elf .
and two men ... ...
aragorn , son of arathorn and boromir of gondor .
you were friend of boromir ?
yes .
for my part .
it would grieve you then to learn that he is dead ?
dead ?
how ?
when ?
as one of his companions , i had hoped you would tell me .
he was my brother .
captain faramir !
we found it .
you must come with me .
now .
down there .
to enter the forbidden pool bears the penalty of death .
they wait for my command .
shall they shoot ?
rock and pool is nice and cool .
so juicy sweet .
.. to catch a fish !
so juicy sweet !
wait .
this creature is bound to me .
and i to him .
he is our guide
please ... ... let me go down to him .
smeagol !
master is here .
come , smeagol !
trust master .
come !
we must ... go now ?
smeagol , you must trust master .
follow me , come on .
come .
come , smeagol .
nice smeagol .
that' s it .
come on .
don' t hurt him !
smeagol , don' t struggle !
smeagol listen to me !
master !
where are you leading them ?
answer me !
smeagol ?
why do you cry , smeagol ?
cruel men hurt us .
master tricked us .
of course he did .
i told you he was tricky .
i told you he was false .
master is our friend ...
our friend ?
master betrayed us !
no , not it' s business .
leave us alone .
filthy little hobbits !
they stole it from us !
no ... no .
what did they steal ?
my precious !
we have to get out of here .
you go .
go now .
you can do it .
use the ring , mr. frodo .
just this once .
put it on .
disappear .
i can' t .
you were right , sam .
you tried to tell me , but ...
i' m sorry .
the ring' s taking me , sam .
if i put it on ... ...
he' il find me .
he' il see .
mr. frodo ...
so ... this is the answer to all the riddles .
here in the wild i have you .
two haflings ... ... and a host of men at my call .
and the ring of power within my grasp .
a chance for faramir , captain of gondor ... ... to show his quality .
no !
stop it !
leave him alone !
don' t you understand ?
he' s got to destroy it !
that' s where we' re going .
into mordor .
to the mountain of fire .
osgiliath is under attack .
they call for reinforcements .
please .
it' s such a burden .
will you not help him ?
capitain ?
prepare to leave .
the ring will go to gondor .
he' s alive !
where is he ?
get out of my way !
i' m gonna kill him !
you are the luckiest , the cunningest and most reckless man i ever knew !
bless you , laddie !
gimli , where is the king ?
you' re late .
you look terrible .
a great host , you say ?
all isengard is emptied .
how many ?
ten thousand strong at least .
ten thousand ?
to destroy the world of men .
they will be here by nightfall .
let them come .
i want every man and strong lad able to bear arms ... ... to be ready for battle by nightfall .
we will cover the causeway and the gate from above .
no army has ever breached the deeping wall ... ... or set foot inside the hornburg !
this is no rabble of mindless orcs !
these are uruk hai .
their armor is thick and their shields broad .
i have fought many wars , master dwarf .
i know how to defend my own keep .
they will break upon this fortress like water on rock .
saruman' s hordes will pillage and burn .
we' re seen it before .
crops can be resown .
homes rebuilt .
within these walls ... ... we will outlast them
they do not come to destroy rohan' s crops or villages !
they come to destroy its people ... ... down to the last child !
what would you have me do ?
look at my men .
their courage hangs by a thread .
if this is to be our end , then i would have them make such an end as to be worthy of remembrance !
send out riders , my lord
you must call for aid .
and who will come ?
elves ?
dwarves ?
we are not so lucky in our friends as you .
the old alliances are dead .
gondor will answer .
gondor ?
where was gondor when the westfold fell ?
where was gondor when our enemies closed in around us ?
where was gon ... ?
no , my lord aragorn ... ... we are alone .
get the women and children into the caves .
we need more time to lay provisions ... ... for a siege , lord .
there is no time .
war is upon us !
secure the gate .
the ents have not troubled ... ... about the wars of men and wizards ... ... for a very long time .
but now something is about to happen ... ... that has not happened ... ... for an age .
ent moot .
what' s that ?
it is a gathering .
a gathering of what ?
beech , oak , chestnut , ash .
good , good , good .
many have come .
now we must decide if we ents will go to war .
move to the cave !
quickly now !
farmers , farriers , stable boys .
these are no soldiers .
most have seen too many winters .
or too few .
look at them .
they' re frightened .
i can see it in their eyes .
and they should be .
three hundred ... ... against ten thousand .
they have a better chance defending themselves here than in edoras .
aragorn ...
they cannot win this fight !
they are all going to die !
then i shall die as one of them !
let him go , lad .
let him be .
every villager able to wield a sword ... ... has been sent to the armory .
my lord ?
who am i , gamling ?
you are our king , sire .
and do you trust your king ?
your men , my lord ... ... will follow you to whatever end .
to whatever end .
where is the horse and the rider ?
where is the horn that was blowing ?
they have passed like rain on the mountains ... ... like wind in the meadow .
the days have gone down in the west ... ... behind the hills ... ... into shadow .
how did it come to this ?
give me your sword .
what is your name ?
haleth , son of hama , my lord .
the men are saying that we will not live out the night .
they say that it is hopeless .
this is a good sword ... ...
haleth , son of hama .
there is always hope .
we have trusted you this far and you have not led us astray .
forgive me .
i was wrong to despair .
there is nothing to forgive , legolas .
if we had time , i' d get this adjusted .
it' s a little tight across the chest .
that is no orc horn !
send for the king .
open the gate !
how is this possible ?
i bring word from elrond of rivendell .
an alliance once existed between elves and men .
long ago we fought and died together .
we come to honour that allegiance .
you are most welcome !
we are proud to fight along side men , once more .
you could have picked a better spot .
well lad , the luck you live by , let' s hope it lasts the night .
your friends are with you , aragorn .
let' s hope they last the night .
show them no mercy !
for you shall receive none !
what' s happening out there ?
shall i describe it to you ?
or would you like me to find you a box ?
hold !
so it begins .
prepare to fire !
their armour is weak at the neck ... ... and under the arms .
release arrows !
anybody hit anything ?
give them a volley .
fire !
send them to me !
come on !
ladders !
good !
swords !
legolas , two already !
i' m on seventeen !
i' il have no pointy ear outscoring me !
nineteen !
merry .
we have just agreed .
yes ?
i have told your names to the entmoot ... ... and we have agreed ... ... you are not orcs .
well that' s good news .
and what about saruman ?
have you come to a decision about him ?
now don' t be hasty , master meriadoc .
hasty ?
our friends are out there .
they need our help !
they cannot fight this war on their own .
war , yes .
it affects us all .
but you must understand , young hobbit ... ... it takes a long time ... ... to say anything in old entish .
and we never say anything ... ... unless it is worth taking ... ... a long time to say .
seventeen .
eighteen .
nineteen .
twenty .
twenty one .
twenty two .
is this it ?
is this all you can conjure , saruman .
bring him down , legolas !
kill him !
kill him !
brace the gates !
hold them !
stand fast !
aragorn !
gimli !
charge !
the ents cannot hold back this war .
we must weather such things as we have always done .
how can that be your decision ?
this is not our war .
but your part of this world !
aren' t you ?
you must help .
please !
you must do something .
you are young and brave , master merry .
but your part in this tale is over .
go back to your home .
maybe treebeard' s right .
we don' t belong here , merry .
it' s too big for us .
what can we do in the end ?
we' re got the shire .
maybe we should go home .
the fires of isengard will spread ... ... and the woods of tuckburough and buckland will burn .
and all that was once green and good in this world will be gone .
there won' t be a shire , pippin .
aragorn !
pull back to the keep !
haldir !
to the keep !
what are you doing ?
stop it !
haldir !
brace the gate !
to the gate !
draw your swords !
we can' t hold much longer .
hold them !
how long do you need ?
as long as you can give me !
gimli !
brace the gate !
come on .
we can take them !
it' s a long way ,
toss me .
what ?
i cannot jump the distance .
toss me !
don' t tell the elf .
not a word .
shore up the door !
gimli !
aragorn !
get out of there !
aragorn !
pull everybody back !
pull them back !
pull back !
they are broken through !
the castle is free !
retreat !
retreat !
hurry !
get them inside !
come , to the keep !
i will leave you at the western borders of the forest .
you can make your way north to your homeland from there .
wait !
stop !
stop !
turn around .
turn around .
take us south !
south ?
but that will lead you past isengard .
yes .
exactly
if we go south we can slip past saruman unnoticed .
the closer we are to danger , the farther we are from harm .
it' s the last thing he' il expect .
that doesn' t make sense to me .
but then ... ... you are very small .
perhaps you' re right .
south it is then .
hold on , little shirelings .
i always like going south .
somehow it feels like going downhill .
are you mad , we' il be caught !
no we won' t .
not this time .
look !
osgiliath burns .
mordor has come .
the ring will not save gondor .
it has only the power to destroy .
please ...
let me go .
hurry .
faramir !
you must let me go !
and a little family of field mice that climb up sometimes ... ... and it tickles me awfully .
they' re always trying to get somewhere .
many of these trees were my friends .
creatures i had known from nut and acorn .
i' m sorry , treebeard .
they had voices of their own .
saruman .
a wizard should know better !
there is no curse in elvish ... ... entish or the tongues of men ... ... for this treachery !
my business is with isengard tonight .
with a rock and stone .
yes !
come my friends !
the ents are going to war .
it is likely ... ... that we go to our dooml
the last march ... ... of the ents .
faramir , orcs have taken the eastern shore .
their numbers are too great .
by nightfall we' il be overrun .
mr. frodo ?
it' s calling to him , sam .
his eye is almost on me .
hold on , mr. frodo .
you' il be alright .
take them to my father .
tell him faramir sends a mighty gift .
a weapon that will change our fortunes in this war .
you wanna know what happened to boromir ?
you wanna know why your brother died ?
he tried to take the ring from frodo !
after swearing an oath to protect him !
he tried to kill him !
the ring drove your brother mad !
watch out !
mr. frodo ?
they' re here .
they' re come .
nazgul !
stay here .
keep out of sight .
take cover !
the fortress is taken .
it is over .
you said this fortress would never fall while your men defend it .
they still defend it .
they have died defending it !
they' re breaking in !
is there no other way for the women and children to get out of the caves ?
is there no other way ?
there is one passage .
it leads into the mountains .
but they will not get far .
the uruk hai are too many .
send word for the women and children to make for the mountain pass .
and barricade the entrance !
so much death .
what can men do against such reckless hate ?
ride out with me .
ride out and meet them .
for death and glory ?
for rohan .
for your people .
the sun is rising .
look to my coming at first light on the fifth day .
at dawn ... ... look to the east .
yes .
yes !
the horn of helm hammerhand ... ... shall sound in the deep ... ... one last time .
yes !
let this be the hour when we draw swords together .
fell deeds awake .
now for wrath ... ... now for ruin ... ... and the red dawn !
forth eorlingas !
gandalf .
theoden king stands alone .
not alone .
rohirrim !
eomer .
to the king !
a hit .
a fine hit .
break the dam !
release the river !
pippin , hold on !
hold on , little hobbits !
what are you doing ?
where are you going ?
it' s me .
it' s your sam .
don' t you know your sam ?
i can' t do this , sam .
i know .
it' s all wrong .
by rights we shouldn' t even be here .
but we are .
it' s like in the great stories , mr. frodo
the ones that really mattered .
full of darkness and danger they were .
and sometimes you didn' t want to know the end ... ... because how could the end be happy ?
how could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad had happened .
victory !
but in the end , it' s only a passing thing ... ... this shadow .
even darkness must pass .
a new day will come .
and when the sun shines it will shine out the clearer .
those were the stories that stayed with you .
that meant something .
even if you were too small to understand why .
but i think , mr. frodo , i do understand .
i know now .
folk in those stories ... ... had lots of chances of turning back , only they didn' t .
they kept going .
because they were holding on to something .
what are we holding on to , sam ?
that there' s some good in this world , mr. frodo .
and it' s worth fighting for .
i think at last we understand one another , frodo baggins .
you know the laws of our country .
the laws of your father .
if you let them go , your life will be forfeit .
then it is forfeit .
release them
sauron' s wrath will be terrible , his retribution swift .
the battle for helm' s deep is over .
the battle for middle earth is about to begin .
all our hopes now lie with two little hobbits ... ... somewhere in the wilderness .
i wonder if we' il ever be put into songs or tales .
what ?
i wonder if people will ever say , " let' s hear about frodo and the ring .
and they' il say , " yes , that' s one of my favorite stories .
frodo was really courageous , wasn' t he , dad ?
yes , my boy ... " " the most famousest of hobbits .
and that' s saying alot .
you left out one of the chief characters .
samwise the brave .
i want to hear more about sam .
frodo wouldn' t have got far without sam .
now mr. frodo , you shouldn' t make fun .
i was being serious .
so was i.
' samwise the brave . '
smeagol ?
we' re not gonna wait for you .
come on !
master .
master looks after us .
master wouldn' t hurt us .
master broke his promise !
don' t ask smeagol .
poor , poor smeagol .
master betrayed us !
wicked , tricky , filth !
we ought to ring his filthy little neck !
kill him !
kill him !
kill them both !
then we take the precious ... ... and we be the master !
but the fat hobbit .
he knows .
eyes always watching .
then we stabs them out !
put out his eyes .
and make him crawl .
yes !
yes !
yes !
kill them both .
yes !
no .
no !
it' s too risky , it' s too risky !
where' re he gone ?
gollum , where are you ?
smeagol ?
we could let her do it .
yes .
she could do it .
yes , precious , she could !
and then we take it once they' re dead .
once they' re dead .
hush !
come on , hobbits .
long ways to go yet !
smeagol will show you the way .
follow me .
