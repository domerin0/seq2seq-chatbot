my name is melinda gordon .
i just got married , just moved to a small town , just opened up an antiques shop .
i might be just like you ... except from the time that i was a little girl ,
i knew that i could talk to the dead .
it' s all right, honey .
earthbound spirits , " my grandmother called them , the ones who have not crossed over yet because they have unfinished business with the living , and they come to me for help .
to tell you my story ,
i have to tell you theirs .
i' m so sorry .
what are you doing ?
i just can' t do this anymore .
no .
no !

i' m serious .
gwen, please !
gwen, please ! think about what are you doing .
part like throuth, gwen please ,
gwen stop it !
don' t ! this isn' t right
please stop it !
i swear i could hear someone yelling up there .
i' m telling you, sometimes i think the walls in thisbuilding are made of tracing paper .
ooh !
we gotta get up there .
she lives alone .
i haven' t seen her all day .
hello ?
can you hear me ?
hello !
break it down .
break it down .
oh, my god !
she took pills .

a lot of aticar, proxytin, others, i think .

call 9 1 1 .
ok, ok .
ma' am ?
ma' am ?
hi .
i have a woman , and she' s unconscious .
259 west main street .
i' m not getting a pulse .
tell them that .
he says she doesn' t have a pulse .
he' s doing cpr .
i' m losin ' her .
no .
gwen, not like this .
it isn' t right .
i just wanted to be with you .
take me with you .
you can see me !
not, no . go away .
i' m looking for my doctor .
where is he ?
i' m sure he' s here .
go away .
tall .
you know what ?
it' s really not a good time .
hey, we got her stabilized .
she should be all right .
what' s gonna happen to her ?
well, all they can do is hold her for a few days .
the hospital psych team will evaluate her .
if they feel like she' s not a threat to herself of anybody else they gotta let her go .
let' s get out of here .
you know what ?
why don' t you guys go ahead, and i' il catch up .
all right .
how come you' re the only one who can see me ?
i' ve been asking myself that question for years .
who are you ?
i' m conor donovan .
um ... i' m her fiance .
you mean were her fiance .
semantics .
has she tried this before ?
no .
well, she' s been depressed since ... since i left .
can i ask how .. how i left ?
it was, um, a year ago .
my third triathlon .
i was kicking ass a 2 1/ 2 mile swim, a 112 mile bike .
i was just getting ready to start the 26 mile run .
i was heading for my best time ever .
nothing was gonna stop me .
nothing ...
except a little kid on a speedster 8500 .
i remember thinking how much i envied that kid .
my father gave me that same bike when i was about his age , and i just wanted to talk to him all about it, you know ?
i wanted to ride that bike again so bad , but then, just like that , no more conor donovan .
i' m sorry .
i didn' t even know what sorry was until i saw gwen get the news .
to see the life just ... go right out of their eyes .
that was a year ago , and you' re still here .
why ?
look at her .
how can i leave ?
she' s got no family .
she' s all alone .
i have to take care of her .
you can' t .
you' re not really ... present with her .
semantics again .
there is something else .
what ?
we have to move her now, ma' am .
did you stop by the hospital ?
on my way in .
she kept asking for you .
i' ve known her for a year, but she asked for you ?
i mean, how could she even know you ?
she was unconscious the entire time .
she saw me .
when ?
she had an out of body experience before jim brought her back .
oh .
i should have known it was something simple like that .
she also saw her dead fiance .
he' s haunting her, just fyi .
that' s how you knew about the pills .
he was at the hospital with her, too .
oh .
that is so ... creepy .
wait a minute .
this can' t be .
what ?
the county tax bill . $15, 000 ?
small business assessment ?
this is like 3 times what i thought it was gonna be .
if this is right, it' s gonna totally blow through my savings .
i saw him .
i saw conor ... at the apartment .
i knew he was there all along .
i know .
i saw you, too .
i saw you talking to him .
how did you do that ?
tell her i' m here now .
tell her .
i know that this is gonna sound strange, and it' s .. not your medication messing with your head .
um ... i can see spirits .
earthbound spirits who haven' t crossed over .
you mean like ghosts ?
i don' t know if they actually told you, but you ... you died, only for a few seconds while my husband was working on you .
he' s a paramedic and ... that' s when you saw me ... and conor .
you can talk to ghosts ?
and hear them ?
how ?
it' s a long story .
is he here now ?
yes, baby, i' m right here .
i' ve always been here .
he' s here .
where ?
right next to you .
on your left .
conor, you didn' t leave me .
no, baby, i told you i' d never leave you .
can he hear me ?
can he hear us ?
yeah .
i just i wanted to see you so badly .
tell her how much i miss her .
i miss talking to her .
he wants you to know that he misses you .
oh, conor, i miss you, too .
i feel you everywhere . it' s like ... my skin hurts and the inside of my bones hurt and it' s just .. it' s so deep i can' t grab ahold of it .
i know, i know .
i can' t even touch it . it' s like i .. baby, i feel it, too .
tell her i' m furious at her .
don' t ever try that again !
he' s mad at you for what you did, and he doesn' t want you to ever .. no, i won' t. i won' t.
that' s enough for tonight .
don' t go .
i won' t .
baby, don' t worry .
hey, we' il see you soon, ok ?
get some rest .
ok .
see what i mean ?
she' s the ..
she' s the same now as she was the day i died .
you said there was one more thing you need to do before you could go . what is it ?
it might sound kind of morbid .
hello .
i' m talking to a dead person .
i was an organ donor and ... the day i died, they took my heart .
i need to see who has it .
why ?
i' v ... i' ve ... i' ve got to see what kind of person is ..
i need to know that they' re taking good care of it .
like waxing and cleaning it ?
no .
i just want to be sure they you know, that it went to somebody ... worthy .
i' m sorry .
and if you find that person , if you see them, will you ... cross over, move on ?
what if i am happy here ?
this isn' t the place for you anymore .
if gwen gets better , if i feel she is taken care of ... then you' il go ?
yes .
we' re surrounded by a world of things but it' s never enough to give us what we want but if we all stop with our self distraction we' il start a world reaction ... he was the kindest man .
he was always trying to make somebody else' s job easier .
we would be at a restaurant and he would brush the crumbs off the table , sweep them into his palm and just hold them until he could throw them out .
and he would grin at me and wink ,
like it was our little secret .
that' s the thing about being with conor .
it felt like he was letting you in on this big secret , something just for the two of us .
ask her if she remembers the time we got lost in boston .
he' s here .
i knew it .
i thought i felt him touch me .
well, kind of, anyway .
it was like a feather against my arm .
sometimes spirits can let you feel their energy .
it' s no more than like a little rush of air .
yeah, right .
i feel that a lot .
does he dim the lights sometimes, too ?
they can also use their energy to affect electricity if they try really hard .
how do you know all this ?
gwen, the thing that i do ... my job ,
i guess you could say, is to help people get closure , make peace with death , sometimes get important messages across .
but it' s all so that people can move on , people who die, people who are left behind .
the idea is to move on .
it' s time for him to go .
did i tell you he used to read to me if i couldn' t fall asleep ?
there will never be anybody else like him, not for me .
i know it seems that way .
no, it is that way .
everything happens for a reason , and that is why conor is still here .
that' s fate, and there' s nothing that you can do about it .
ok .
i want to talk about boston .
how come a ghost would know where his heart went ?
probably because he went straight to gwen when he died .
oh .
i' m not sure it' s such a great idea .
why not ?
well, maybe a recipient doesn' t want to know where his organ came from especially a heart .
and that' s a hard enough ordeal to go through .
they' re asking you to meet the person who gave you your heart and by the way, that person' s dead .
it' s been a year .
maybe he' s curious .
besides, it' s the only way i' m gonna get this guy to cross over so just tell me where to start .
well, if he died at mercy, they' ve got a helipad , so his organs would have been harvested immediately and choppered right out .
but you are gonna need somebody at the hospital whose willing to bend the rules a little bit .
we never give out that kind of information .
yeah, i know, but the thing is ,
i' m not trying to get you in any trouble .
it' s just, the information is for someone very ... are you family ?
well, in the family of man sense, i guess .
sorry .
no way .
anything else ?
can you at least give me cities and initials ?
this isn' t jeopardy ! .
bye, now .
aw, damn .
the second generator didn' t kick in .
please wait here till the lights come back .
can you help me ?
donor' s name ... date of death ... and the code r w h o d.
hurry .
ok .
got it .
thank you .
can i do anything for you ?
rain check .
everything ok ?
you can go now, if that' s what you mean ?
damn .
anyway, coming these past few weeks ,
listening, watching ... it was my doctor' s idea, not mine .
he' s always telling me to try we usually begin our talks with the introduction .
oh, yeah .
ok .
my name is cliff aimes , and it' s been a year since my surgery .
please tell everyone what kind of surgery .
transplant .
congratulations on your " surgiversary .
yeah, but the thing is ,
i' ve had a bad heart my whole life .
i always felt like i had one foot in the grave and the other one on a banana peel .
ow . it' s a tough room .
i mean, it' s not like i' m not grateful for the heart i got .
i am .
i just ...
i feel even more afraid now, like ... maybe i don' t even deserve to have it .
maybe someone else should talk .
i really liked what you had to say .
why ?
it sounded like the truth .
melinda gordon .
cliff aimes .
don' t tell me you' re a heart patient .
no .
no, i' m more like a student .
studying what ?
the impact on people with things like this .
things like ?
transplants .
the emotional impact ... you know, what it' s like to get a second chance .
i' m still trying to figure out what went wrong with the first chance .
maybe you could help me .
i don' t think so .
i' m just curious .
you may have noticed, i don' t excel at talking to groups .
i' m not too good at talking one on one either, so ... it was nice to meet you .
do you ever find yourself thinking about the donor ?
why would you ask me that ?
i mean, it' s a natural thing to ... what else do you want to ask me ?
if i get hungry for things i never liked before ?
if i smell things so freakin ' familiar
i just can' t figure out what they are ?
do you ?
ask me if i feel guilty because some guy i didn' t know is dead and i' m here, talking to you about it .
well, what did you expect ?
i expected somebody filled with joy about having a new lease on life .
and you got andy rooney .
hey, how' s gwen ?
feeling better .
is her fiance still making things go bump in the night ?
sometimes i don' t know who' s holding who back ... but every time i see them together , the only thing that i can think of is how lucky we are ... and what they' d give to have what we have .
let' s not ever take that for granted, ok ?
deal .
even so, if something ever happened to me and you were alone, i would want you to be happy .
no .
i' d want you to find someone and find love again .
i mean, wouldn' t you want the same thing for me if something happened to you ?
no .
no ? !
you wouldn' t want me to be happy ?
fine .
sure i would, ok ?
make friends, go out and make money, be happy ,
but no other guy .
ok .
out of the question .
how did i snag such a sensitive, modern man ?
guess you can just call me lucky .
hey, look at this .
it says that my tax bill was paid in full .
who could have done this ?
wow !
i don' t know .
maybe somebody you helped or something ?
who ?
i don' t know anybody who has this kind of money and how would they know ?
i' m gonna call the tax board and find out .
anyway, i decided that we should get gwen out of her apartment .
right ?
i mean, she really needs a girls ' night out .
that' s a great idea .
cool .
so saturday night, lento' s on the square ?
no karaoke ?
cross my heart .
i' il be there .
aren' t you haunting the wrong girl ?
is that him ?
hi .
what are you doing here ?
um ... take my picture ?
you don' t meet the height requirement .
excuse me .
i have to develop these .
develop ? thought everyone uses digital now .
everyone does .
i don' t.
listen, can i talk to you ?
digital is electronic .
it' s cold .
film is chemical .
it' s emotional .
there' s no comparison .
did you take these ?
you have a wonderful eye .
you should put them out, let people see them .
yeah .
they' d just remind me of something else i never became .
no !
does he have any idea what he is doing to my heart ?
do you smell that ?
what ?
like flowers ?
gardenias .
no .
now it' s gone .
that drives me crazy !
weren' t you happy to get a new heart ?
what ?
you don' t think i' m grateful ?
you don' t think i wake up at night and hear it beating and just not understand why i should be so lucky ?
sometimes i think they just wasted this on me .
he thinks too much .
maybe i just don' t know how to use it .
i know you' ve been sick your whole life , and maybe you' ve just been sick for so long , you don' t know how to be well .
look, there' s no reason for you to listen to me and there' s no reason for you to trust me .
i' m just ... there' s someone i' d like you to meet , someone i think you' d have something ... profound in common with .
i think you' d both get a lot out of it .
you have to have an open mind, though .
who ?
cliff aimes, i' d like you to meet gwen alexander .
sorry .
you just look so familiar .
hi .
well, um ... we have a table all ready, so ... well, why don' t you two go on ahead , and we' il be in in a minute .
we will ?
i' m starving .
then why don' t you show them the table and come back out and talk to me for a minute ?
all right .
what are you doing ?
you were supposed to introduce him to me .
semantics .
you said you wanted to see him .
you said nothing about meeting him .
he' s not her type .
look, we' il talk about this later .
lucy, you have some' s plaining to do .
i just want give them a few minute alone, let them talk
maybe we should order .
yeah .
you said that i looked familiar .
what did you mean ?
like i' ve seen you somewhere before .
i get like this a lot lately .
do you smell that ?
the bread ?
no .
uh, sweet ...
like gardenia ?
oh, that' s my perfume .
it' s too much, maybe .
no .
no, i
i' ve been smelling it for such a long time ,
i just i can never figure out where it' s coming from .
excuse me .
there' s a couple over there in the corner, breaking up .
i think they need you more than we do right now .
thank you .
play a happy song, at least .
what sort of work do you do ?
i' m a teacher, fourth grade .
i haven' t felt much like working since ...
i love kids .
they' re the only original thinkers in the world .
really ?
do you have any kids ?
no .
hell, no .
i' ve had a lot of health problems lately , so i figured i' d never be around long enough to .. have them .
sorry .
did i say something ?
no .
i' m sorry .
i do this a lot lately .
me, too .
you cry ?
especially lately .
i don' t know why .
i just ...
i' il see something the look on someone' s face or ...
or the way a dog watches me ... and all of a sudden, i just ... can' t stop crying .
are you ok ?
i' m sorry .
i have to go .
excuse me .
was that a date ?
did it feel like one ?
considering she left before we even ordered food ,
i' d say, roughly, yes .
that' s my usual date .
but what did you think of her ?
i feel like ... i know her .
how weird is that ?
i felt ... ah, forget it .
ooh .
forget it .
no .
she' s someone worth knowing .
take a chance .
why ?
look, you' re all about avoiding .
i get it .
why did you accept that heart ?
was it to avoid death, or was it to choose life ?
i think you owe me an explanation .
ok, it seemed to me like cliff and gwen might have some things in common .
me .
she doesn' t need this .
can' t you see how much pain she' s in ?
we had a deal .
you promised you would cross over .
gwen' s not ready .
conor, let me me honest .
it' s not gwen that has the problem here .
it' s you .
and it' s not like she doesn' t want to move on , it' s that you won' t let her .
that is ridiculous .
i don' t interfere in any way .
she feels your presence .
she know you' re there , and you' re holding her back by staying in her life , and this thing with cliff it' s not about him .
it' s about her taking a step .
it' s about her moving forward and you letting go .
she loves me .
i know that, conor and i know that you love her, too .
but she can' t love a dead man not the way that you want her to , and you can' t love her the way that she wants you to the way that she needs you to , and it' s not right to expect it .
everything all right ?
yeah .
sorry if we woke you .
this one' s having a bit of a boundary problem .
don' t they all ?
ok .
let' s have gwen decide .
what ?
tomorrow .
we' il ask gwen straight out what she wants , and i' il respect her wishes but if she says that she wants me to stay with her ...
i want you to leave us both alone .
it was a very intereresting conversation .
i asked the tax board who paid my bill , and they said it was one andrea moreno .
i didn' t want you to know .
obviously .
how do you have this kind of money ?
i have a little nest egg put away .
and it' s fine, ok ?
so don' t worry .
i i' m ... stunned .
and ...
i can' t i can' t accept it .
it' s just too much .
look, just pay me back when you can afford it, ok ?
or, better yet, um ... what ? you could accept the $15, 000 as a down payment .
for what ?
for ... making me your partner .
andrea, i already consider you my partner .
melinda, i love it here .
you know, i love the people , and i love this place , and i have a little bit of money put away , and i could pay you something really fair , and we could grow this place together .
i don' t know what to say .
well ... say , " yes . " i mean ...
yes , " is all you have to say .
you could say , " yes .
yes .
yeah ?
yes ?
yes, i would love for you to be my partner .
oh, thank you so much .
you don' t know how much this means to me .
i' m so happy .
partner, partner
my life just got much easier
i' ve been doing a lot of thinking lately about the whole manwoman thing and why i' ve never been too good at it .
maybe it' s because
i would always hide inside my illness .
i never had to give too much .
i never had to take too much .
after all, i had other things to worry about ,
like " would i be alive next week ?
and after a while, i ...
i stopped thinking about it , and it got easier to be alone , didn' t have to take any chances , the joys of a risk free life .
and now ...
i have this ... strong, new heart ... and i can feel it beating inside my chest ,
like it wants to come out ,
like it' s saying , " give me more .
and ... i don' t want to ... stop this feeling, but ...
i wanna fill it .
like i, uh ...
i have to fill it .
and i don' t even know if i know ... how, exactly .
but i' m gonna try .
can he be talking about gwen ?
you never told me what you thought of cliff .
is conor here ?
you can speak freely .
i did like cliff .
i did .
he was funny .
i feel like i' m being unfaithful .
it' s like conor is my guardian angel .
it' s so comfortable when he' s here, so familiar .
so safe ?
being with cliff, even for a few minutes last night, it was ... fun .
i feel like i knew him .
we talked about kids for a second , and it made me want to go back to work .
but i crave conor so much .
conor .
i love you so much .
all i want is to be with you every day and every night .
just like it used to be .
will you will you tell her that, please ?
he' s telling you that he loves you , that he wants to be with you all the time .
i love you, too, conor .
but i don' t want you to live a risk free life .
you shouldn' t waste your heart on a dead man .
he' s letting you go, gwen .
no .
no, conor .
no .
i didn' t mean what i said before .
i want you .
don' t ... let me go .
i can' t do this without you .
that' s why i have to go .
what is he saying ?
what ... he' s leaving .
gwen , he' s crossing over .
wait until after i go, and then tell her when she thinks of all the things we did ... it' il remind her that love is possible .
conor ... what ?
she' il find it again .
i will .
what ?
what ... what is he saying ?
i love you .
he' s gone .
he' s gone .
i have been dying to do this since we moved here .
saturday night, grandview players . " high drama .
i just hope the theater isn' t haunted .
be nice to sit through the entire play .
hey .
you know, cliff and gwen saw this last week, and they loved it .
what do you think' s gonna happen with those two ?
who knows ?
it almost doesn' t matter .
you know, they' re good for each other right now . that' s all that counts .
right now ... is all that counts .
mm .
you think so ?
as in , " why don' t you and i sneak out right now ?
don' t you have a life to save or two ?
probably .
whatever .
yeah .
i should get back to work, too .
