' although police still suspect she could have drowned ,
' they are not ruling out the possibility of abduction .
' architect husband jonathan rivers spoke of his anguish today ... '
' three weeks since the disappearance of author anna rivers ... ' ' police say they are constructing a profile of a likely abductor . '

my goodness .
you were outside my house .

don' t insult my intelligence by telling me that' s a coincidence .
no , it' s no coincidence .
do i know you ?
my name is raymond price .
are you following me ?
it' s about anna , mr. rivers .
i' ve been receiving messages from her , from the other side .
from what other side ?
jonathan ... your wife is dead .
i have proof .
she' s been trying to communicate ever since the moment of her death .
look , mr. rivers , my son died when he was 12 .
for years i' ve been suicidal .
look .
just stay away from me .
but then someone told me what i have told you .
that my son , my dead son , had made contact .
and he had , mr. rivers , it was true .
from the other side .
and he was happy .
happy .
please .
yes .
and also at ease .
and it changed my life , mr. rivers , because then , then i knew .
so please , please , mr. rivers , put this in a drawer , hide it , forget about it , but please don' t throw it away .
because , one day ... you will want to know .
my thoughts are with you both .
' it' s anna rivers .
' the fabulous anna rivers carrying groceries . '
' stop it . ' ' how was shopping ? '
' turn it off . ' ' ok .
just ...
' there' s one of her best features . ' ' shut up . '
' that' s a beautiful thing , ladies and gentlemen . '
' the body of internationally renowned author anna rivers
' was discovered last night by a security guard making a routine visit ... ' ' ... to the disused pier 16 , three miles upriver
' from where her car was found abandoned
' five weeks ago on argyle avenue .
' the discovery brings to an end ... ' ' before she drowned ,
' your wife sustained injuries consistent with a fall onto the rocks by the river .
' the damage to the head , the break to the arm .
' when the tide came in , she would have been unable to help herself .
' she would have been swept upstream several miles .
' i' m so sorry for your loss . '
' divers recovered her personal effects .
' her cell phone was in her car , and we' re returning it to you . ' ... giving her to us , her family and friends , to know and to love as a companion on our earthly pilgrimage .
give us faith to see in death the gate of eternal life , so that in quiet confidence we may continue our course on earth until , by your call , we are reunited with those who have gone before .
amen .
amen .
so , what do you think ?
i love it .
yeah ?
yeah .
it' s nice here .
all right .
it' s a fresh start .
i guess .
could you ...
could you take mikey for the weekend ?
yeah , of course .
maybe ... maybe a little longer .
as long as you want , john .
we' re gonna go lay the floor now .
when are you gonna bring them ?
they' d like to see you this week .
sure .
fine , it shouldn' t be any problem .
whoops .
you brought me here just to do that , didn' t you ?
no , i didn' t .
let me see what i can do here .
this is where you tell me you' re running over budget , right ?
shit .
keep doing that !
i' m sorry , i didn' t ...
ask them if they have a light .
you guys ok ?
we are now .
yeah .
i trust you' il fix this before mr. cunningham arrives .
anna ?
' jonathan . '
' you have one message .
' message received wednesday 23rd ,
' 2 : 30am . '
' jonathan . '
' end of message .
you have no messages . '
' you have no messages .
' you have no messages . '
oh !
please , come .
how nice .
hello .
hi .
look , er ...
i was just about to finish with someone .
i can come back .
no , it won' t take long .
i' m really glad to see you .
i was hoping that you' d come .
thank you .
this is sarah tate .
let me introduce you to mr. rivers .
sorry , i' m a little ...
we' ve had a breakthrough today .
it' s incredible .
it truly is .
this is ridiculous .
stay awhile .
i should get these boxes back to the store .
sarah , there' s no need to hurry .
make yourself a cup of tea .
i suppose .
thank you .
would you like one ?
yeah , that' d be great .
thank you .
thank you .
mr. rivers , please .
oh , er ...
excuse me .
please , sit here .
sit .
so , have you heard of e. v. p. , mr. rivers ?
no .
i' m not surprised .
those that have call us cranks .
e. v. p. stands for electronic voice phenomenon .
i' m listening .
well .
i' m not a clairvoyant , i' m not a medium ,
i don' t contact the dead , the dead contact me .
and , with e. v. p. ,
i can hear them ,
i can see them , and ...
i can record them .
' ...
i understand ... '
' ... you shouldn' t be ... '
and they are ...
that' s right .
people that have passed over .
is this your job , or a hobby , or what ?
i think obsession would be more appropriate , to be honest .
now , i wonder where ...
ah !
here we are .
they don' t always appear visually the first few times .
we tend only to pick up their voices and people can find that frustrating .
but when it works , and you see the faces of the people that you' re able to help , like sarah , nothing , believe me , nothing comes close .
mr. rivers , do you want to hear your wife ?
yes .
' jonathan .
' jonathan .
' find him .
' jonathan rivers .
' find him .
' jonathan ...
jonathan ...
' rivers ...
' find him , please . '
the frustrating thing about e. v. p. is it' s not live .
you need to make the recording and you' il only know if you' ve got results when you play it back .
here .
it has milk .
perfect .
thank you .
excuse me for a moment .
it' s an amazing feeling , isn' t it ?
er ...
it' s indescribable .
it took me a few visits to get used to it but it' s addictive .
i' m here all the time .
he' s really helped me .
i try to help him when i can , so i keep some of this stuff at the store .
what store ?
i have a bookstore .
your wife was a wonderful writer , mr. rivers .
yeah .
so what made you come here ?
my fianc .
he died eight months ago .
we' ve had trouble deciphering what he' s been saying but this afternoon we cracked it .
only two words " sarah , yes .
because , before he died , he promised me that if it was like they say it is that he would find a way of getting to me and letting me know that he' s happy .
so , " sarah , yes .
oh .
raymond thinks we probably won' t see him again now but that' s ok .
and i' ve heard what i wanted to hear .
anna ... this is john .
if there' s any way you can hear me ... will you please let me know ?
please .
just any kind of ...
just any kind of sign .
please .
' susie . '
' susie . '
' susie , i ... '
i recorded this a few hours ago .
it' s quite faint , so i had to save it as a sound file on the computer to enhance the sound .
so , um ... she knows that i visited ?
i believe so .
so will i get to see her this time ?
no .
this will just be sound .
i' m sorry , john , we have to be a little patient .
trust me , john , this is just the beginning .
sit , here .
now ...
if you want to hear it again , just press that key .
i' il be back in a moment .
' tell him ... because i love him . '
' tell him ... because i love him . '
' bastard .
bastard . '  ' bastard . '
what was that ?
it' s ok , it' s ok .
we do have some very bad people out there .
you just have to press that ... and they' re all gone .
we' ve had a step towards visual contact with anna .
let' s celebrate that .
here .
they can' t all be nice , they can' t all be anna .
' susie tomlinson ... smile . '
' susie tomlinson ... sm ... '
hello .
' lt' s raymond .
something' s happening . ' really ?
' get over here . ' i' m on my way .
hello ?
raymond ?
so you' il tell me whatever you find out ?
i can' t tell you any more than you' il read in the papers .
yeah , thanks .
thank you for coming to the service .
it would' ve meant a lot to him .
oh .
thank you for doing this for me .
i' m not sure where to start .
he was working off a disk , so ...
maybe anna' s original tapes might be in one of these boxes .
you all right ?
i still can' t believe he' s gone .
well ...
maybe he' il be in touch .
i don' t know .
said he' d made enough of a nuisance of himself when he was alive .
just doesn' t make any sense .
he was helping people .
wow .
these go back years .
23 , to be precise .
carol should know .
tell thomas he should .
men in the room .
oh , here' s one " 500 dollars still there .
that' s the kind of message i like .
yeah .
there we go .
why do we got so many ?
so you can watch your favorite show and i can watch my favorite show .
yeah .
ok ...
um ...
they' re showing me something .
it' s ...
it' s , uh ...
willow avenue .
they' re showing me willow avenue .
yes ?
no .
no .
no .
oh .
ok .
it' s no problem .
sometimes it happens .
your wife , she passed over recently .
yeah .
her passing was difficult .
yeah .
she was , um ...
she' s a writer .
she was a writer .
yeah , her words are important .
oh ...
i' m sorry , the light is way too bright .
it' s ... it' s like these tiny , noisy , little pinpoints .
it' s making it hard to see anything at all .
can you ...
it' s electronic voice ...
i know what this is .
i' ve been making tapes ...
you shouldn' t .
you shouldn' t try this by yourself , it' s not safe .
it' s like homemade ouija boards and teenage sances at halloween .
e. v. p. is not good .
we spend years developing our relationships with our guides so that we can protect you .
from what ?
from the ones who like damage .
cos they are out there and they will find you .
if you' re gonna keep insisting on meddling , then ...
anna , my wife , she sent me a sign .
no .
no .
not anna .
you are misreading everything .
listen , it is one thing to contact the dead , it is another to meddle , and you are meddling .
i just came cos i wanted some help .
i know , i can help you .
it' s just that they are urging me to tell you to stop .
right .
thank you .
mr. rivers ...
willow avenue .
are you sure ?
they keep showing me willow avenue .
no .
no willow avenue , no willow street , no willow terrace .
mr. rivers .
she was pregnant .
yes ?
' we play every day . '
' he says you are happier now . '
' did i die ? '
' susie .
' susie tomlinson ... ' smile .
' susie tomlinson .
' smile '
excuse me .
are you susie tomlinson ?
yeah .
my name' s jonathan rivers .
hi .
may i speak to you ?
my mother died giving birth to me .
and my grandmother , she tried for years to make contact with her .
you know , with candles , darkness and smoke ...
sances ?
yeah .
all of that , she tried everything .
she used to tell me ... that when she died she' d let me know if she found her , if she ... if she found my mother .
whenever i was sad , she nagged me to cheer up .
she would say , " susie tomlinson , look on the brighter side .
susie tomlinson , lighten up .
susie tomlinson , smile .
they' ve found each other .
haven' t they ?
that' s what she wanted me to know .
it' s like she didn' t really die .
i get the call from my father and then , what , like two days later you come by ?
it' s like she just carried straight on .
susie , i don' t understand .
i' ve been getting messages from your grandmother for a week .
no , that can' t be .
she just passed away two days ago .
' they are ruling nothing out in the case of missing mother of two , mary freeman .
' lt' s been nine days since she left her house ... '
where are we gonna eat now ?
on our laps .
there you go .
it works .
what' s that , dad ?
that means it' s time for us to go pack up your gear .
come on .
one , two , three ...
hoi !
that' s it .
next week , can i watch a video and you watch a video like you said ?
yep , but only if you' re good , and ready for when your mom comes to pick you up .

mr. black .
john ...
mr. black .
uh ...
this is gonna sound strange but i need to tell you .
i went to willow avenue because she reached out to me , she asked for help .
that' s the thing .
she wanted help .
i am grateful for what you did , mr. rivers .
my son wouldn' t be here if it wasn' t for you .
so thank you .
but now i' d like you to leave us alone .
mr. black ...
carol may have believed your bullshit but not me .
so you and your sick friends , you stay the fuck away from me and my family , you understand ?
you stay away .
number one , they' re not dead .
when i see them , they' re not dead .
she shows me things that haven' t happened .
things that haven' t happened ?
right .
number two , she' s showing me things that are here , not somewhere else where i can' t do anything .
she doesn' t show me an earthquake in india or some bomb in the middle east , they' re here in this city where i can maybe do something .
i' ve seen things that haven' t happened yet .
you understand ?
i can see how you' re putting it together .
putting it ... ?
putting it together ?
what do you mean ?
she wants me to help .
i couldn' t help carol black .
but i can help them .
' jonathan rivers ' office . ' karen , cancel my appointments
for the next few days .
' are you all right ? '
i need a few days .
' take care of yourself . ' yeah , i will .
' it hurts . '
' stop .
' she' s ours . '
' she' s ours . '
' john , my love . ' ' willow avenue . '
' stop , you pig .
willow avenue . '
it' s the same voice .
when i was at raymond' s , he had been receiving messages , angry , violent messages .
now i' m getting the same thing , sarah .
but from whom ?
i don' t know .
sarah .
edith tomlinson , 207 .
i was getting messages from susie tomlinson' s grandmother .
she was trying to reach her dead daughter , susie' s mother .
edith tomlinson .
daughter died giving birth , tapes 200 to 208 .
susie' s grandmother .
she was visiting raymond .
probably just a coincidence .
look for carol black , the woman in the car .
remember what her husband said ?
my wife might have been into that shit but i wasn' t .
carol black .
general interest , tape number 231 .
raymond had lists of clients .
you' ve seen only two .
i' ve seen hundreds of faces .
it could be the same with all of them .
i' m in there , you' re in there , edith , carol , they' re just two people ...
there' s too much else .
it' s a coincidence .
mary freeman .
the missing woman .
she' s on my tapes .
i' ve seen her .
she' s on my tapes .
first they visit raymond .
then i see them .
then they die .
what are you doing ?
if she' s alive , anna will show her to me .
we don' t know that everyone you see is alive .
susie' s grandmother , carol black .
what about anna ?
anna' s different .
she' s helping me .
we don' t know what' s happening here .
i do .
if mary freeman' s on these tapes , she might be alive and we might be able to save her .
sarah !
sarah , come here !
look at this .
come here .
come here .
look at this .
hear that ?
that' s her .
oh , my god .
she' s alive .
' go .

john ...
anna , go where ?
' please , john .
go ! '
go ... go where , baby ?
' go now ! ' go where ?
go where ?

she' s gonna die .
you don' t know that .
she' s on the tape .
she' s on the tape .
she' s gonna die .
' john .
' john .
' lt hurts . '
oh , my god .
oh , my god .
what if i don' t wake up ?
you will .
i promise you will .
you will stay with me ?
sure .
sure .
promise ?
promise .
thank you .
sarah ?
god .
it' s as much as we can say .
there' s a 30 , 40 % chance she might pull through .
let' s hope she' s ok .
thanks again for your help .
mr. rivers .
neighbors say they saw you on the balcony when miss tate fell .
is that true ?
i was trying to stop her .
from falling ?

i don' t know .
i don' t know .

' damage to the head , the break to the arm ... '

men in the room .

we commit the body to the ground .
from earth to earth , ashes to ashes , dust to dust .

# last time i talked to you
# you were lonely and out of place
# you were looking down on me
# lost out in space
# laid underneath the stars
# strung out and feeling brave
# watch the riddles glow
# watch them float away
# down here in the atmosphere
# garbage and city lights
# you gonna save your tired soul
# you' re gonna save our lives
# turned on the radio
# to find you on satellite
# i' m waiting for the sky to fall
# i' m waiting for a sign
# and all we are
# is all so far
# you' re falling back to me
# the star that i can' t see
# i know you' re out there
# somewhere out there
# you' re falling out of reach
# defying gravity
# i know you' re out there
# somewhere out there
# hope you remember me
# when you' re homesick and need a change
# i miss your purple hair
# i miss the way you taste
# i know you' il come back some day
# on a bed of nails i wait
# i' m praying that you don' t burn out
# or fade away
# and all we are
# is all so far
# you' re falling back to me
