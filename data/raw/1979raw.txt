i am here to speak about trains .
the first real train in this country was built by peter cooper in 1829 .
does anyone know what it was called ?
it was called the tom thumb .
since that time , trains have helped make this country what it is today .
a long time ago , most people never left their towns because travel was hard .
uh , yes ?
how tall are you ?
jacob !
i' m , uh ...
i' m four feet and five inches tall .
i' m taller than you .
jacob , come with me .
i' m so sorry .
be back in a minute .
such a jerk .
what about blimps ?
i think blimps came later .
when ?
i' m not sure exactly .
blimps are cool .
well , so are trains .
yeah , well , they' re both cool .
trains and blimps .
anybody hungry for dessert ?
i' m stuffed .
yeah .
me , too .
there' s plenty of food .
we can have it for lunch tomorrow .
hey , when were blimps invented ?
i have no idea .
yeah , me neither .
you can go down to the library and ask that little hottie .
she is cute .
it' s the librarian fantasy , man .
glasses off , hair down .
books flying .
she doesn' t wear glasses .
well , buy her some .
it' s worth it .
