when i was a kid i thought cats were female dogs .
and i thought turtle doves were female pigeons .
and i thought weasels were female badgers .
you' re insane .
and i thought men and women were two different species .
so , you were in bangkok ?
yup .
tell me about it .
what do you want to know ?
i hear whores are in aquariums .
yup , and they' re usually naked .
how much do they go for ?
a blow job is 500 thai bahts .
that' s the same in czech crowns .
a fuck is 500 or 1000 .
sometimes you can get both for a grand .
what about kissing ?
kissing ?
that' s most expensive of all .
it' il run you at least 2500 .
you didn' t know that ?
i guess i forgot .
tell me about this girl .
the girl you' re about to meet is absolutely one of a kind .
she' s modest , intelligent , but mostly she' s self sacrificing .
a pretty rare combination .
is she seeing anyone now ?
every girl' s seeing someone unless she' s seeing you .
or should i say , me .
you' ve had a girlfriend for three years .
i don' t get ...
why you want to meet this girl .
cause our relationship' s shaky .
this might be worth filming .
it was a joke .
a stupid one .
okay , if i film you arguing ?
we' re not going to argue .
are you mental ?
hang on .
i thought you said your relationship was shaky .
i did not .
think that' s funny ?
you' re really pushing it .
wait a minute .
all i did was help you realize you' ve come to a dead end .
thanks .
my consciously acting like as wine has cleansed you .
i' ve pointed out how ridiculous your lives are .
next time we need something ...
well definitely , let you know .
you wanted to know if she was the right girl for you .
that means i' m not .
then let' s do something .
like what ?
all we can do is flip a coin .
what are you talking about ?
you heard me .
heads we stay together , tails we break up .
okay .
i' il flip .
you mean you' d actually do it ?
it was your idea .
isn' t it odd for two grown people to decide whether or not to break up by flipping a coin ?
yeah , i guess it is .
come on in .
awesome pad .
don' t turn it off .
awesome tune .
what is it ?
the national anthem , bonehead .
oh , yeah .
i haven' t heard the instrumental version lately , so i forgot it .
is there something you want ?
huh ?
you want something ?
yeah , of course .
it' s in my car .
do you know they got monkeys dealing drugs in thailand ?
what kind of monkeys ?
gibbons .
how could they do that ?
like anyone else .
they deliver packages and collect money just like you do .
hang on .
are you implying i' m a monkey ?
let me tell you something , pal .
you' re a total burn out .
you' re thirty years old ...
i' m twenty nine .
who cares ?
you' re a loser .
you quit school , you work as a moving man ...
youire constantly stoned , and you hardly know your own name .
hey , you' re right .
i am thirty .
mean while you could be the master of your own destiny .
you could play an active role in the story of your life .
you keep smoking weed and you' il be a basket case by 35 .
or you come to your senses , and take hold of your destiny .
there is some truth to that .
it' s entirely up to you .
what do you think i should do ?
cocaine .
holyshit !
promise you' il think about it .
i can do that .
what do i want you to do ?
think about it !
okay .
i' il think about it .
are you serious about me ?
you bet .
sure this isn' t just about sex ?
excuse me ?
we just met .
i don' t even know your sign .
what is your sign ?
does it matter ?
would you be a capricorn ?
why ?
they don' t like saying what sign they are .
then i' m a capricorn .
you are ?
that' s good .
what can i get you ?
a rapid and ...
a regular shot for 55 or a bodyshot for 155 ?
a regular shot .
wait .
what' s a bodyshot ?
you put salt behind your ear , lemon ...
i' d have to show you .
then show us .
i' d have to demonstrate ...
... on her .
go ahead , then .
i' m no guinea pig .
find someone else , okay ?
yuck !
i' m all sticky !
what time do you get off work ?
you two will be asleep by then .
that' s my sister .
dear friends , back in prep school ...
back in high school ...
would you mind if we had a few people over ?
of course not .
who ?
travel agency clients .
czechs ?
no , more like japanese .
japanese again !
they want to see how a typical czech family lives .
how do you envision this ?
will we have to wear costumes ?
will i have to act like a fool or dress up as a plumber ?
why would you have to dress up as a plumber ?
i don' t know .
did i say , as a plumber ?
yes , you did .
that was just one way i could make a fool of myself .
you won' t have to do that .
they' il come over .
they' il watch us eat , walk the dog ...
do we have a dog ?
we could borrow one .
nothing against the japanese , but our family is sacred to me .
i respect what we' ve built .
our family is a private matter .
i don' t want tourists eyeing us .
very nicely put .
dear friends ...
some years ago ...
excellent .
that' s it .
some years ago ...
a break up ?
you leave a piece of your soul with everyone you break up with .
the missing piece is what hurts .
because it' s not with you .
eventually it comes back to you , but it takes a long time .
sometimes i see blue lights on people .
they' re pieces of the souls of people who used to love you .
sometimes they' re the hopes your parents had for you .
that' s the second kind .
everyone' s covered with lights .
really .
the japanese have even invented a way to measure it .
the japanese , huh ?
they know how to measure it .
why don' t i drive instead ?
why ?
i' m fine .
really ?
no pressure .
i understand .
it can mess up your short term memory .
but it can help your long term one .
holyshit !
don' t move him !
his spine could be messed up .
he' s pinned in here .
shouldn' t we call an ambulance ?
i used to drive an ambulance .
really ?
really .
we' re not moving him , right ?
of course not .
i m just looking at the wayhes pinned in there .
we' re not moving him , right ?
no .
his spine could be messed up .
someyears ago my girlfriend left me .
i was so upset that i would have done anything just to see her .
i even dressed up as aplumber to get into her apartment .
for two years i followed her around and walked by her house .
i left flowers on her doorstep .
his idea of an a typical speech .
yet i knew something complex and mysterious was guiding me .
my brain .
so instead of devoting my life to that girl ,
i devoted it to the human brain .
thank you .
thank you , professor .
tonight proves you didn' t make such a bad choice .
excuse me , i have an emergency .
i understand .
such is the life of a neurosurgeon .
in recent years neurosurgery has made great strides ...
we can move my stuff tomorrow , jakub .
will you come pick me up ?
now , we' il apply ...
do you have that ?
yes , i do .
this is petr .
this band will be coming to prague ...
and now for a new contest called record your mother .
send me tapes of your mothers for all our listeners to hear .
now for something i think is really good .
we never see you .
you go to bars and you look like a druggie .
it' s that lifestyle of yours .
and those friends of yours ...
you got sick of her so you sent her packing .
some boyfriend you are !
that' s not him .
he' s just helping me move .
then go on in .
i' ve never met your friends .
it was petr .
you know him .
petr ?
that petr ?
i knew hed send you packing from the minute i saw him .
why isn' t petr helping you if he sent you packing ?
he didn' t send me packing .
we just broke up .
some life you lead .
listen to that cough .
it' s that lifestyle of yours again .
it' s from the air here .
where ?
at our house ?
no , the prague air .
it' s that lifestyle of yours !
and those friends of yours , for christ' s sake .
keep your hands off her !
you let everyone touch you .
goodbye .
i' il just be staying for a few nights .
no problem .
hi !
hi , dad .
we' re glad you' re here .
i don' t get it .
why are you like this when dad and i are so happy ?
i' m not all that happy .
yes , you are .
happy is what she will never be !
have his relatives been by ?
no .
strangers brought him in .
let me see that .
are these their names ?
yes .
do you know them ?
no , why ?
never heard of them .
on the contrary .
doctor ?
i' m sorry .
this apartment looks fine .
it' s too luxurious .
and the lady in south prague ?
she lives alone .
it' s sad to say , but yours is the only typical family around .
sorry , but my family is sacred .
we will not perform for anyone .
this doesn' t belong here , but this girl is interesting .
could they go to her house ?
no , to her parents house .
she has excellent parents .
her mother' s especially crazed .
and they' d go for it .
listen , i' ve got to go .
take it easy .
bye !
hi , ondrej !
what a coincidence !
hanka !
what are you doing here ?
i have a meeting .
what are you up to ?
i' m in school .
great !
how about your boyfriend ?
we' re still together .
i' m glad to hear that .
i heard him on the radio .
really ?
i listen to him on the radio sometimes .
can i give you a hug ?
a hug ?
just as friends .
sure .
sometime ago i made a private agreement with god .
that i' d become a doctor on account of you .
and once i' d saved enough lives , god would give you back to me .
oh ...
last night i operated on the man you brought in .
did you ?
how is he ?
fine .
and it was a sign .
what kind of sign ?
i don' t know yet , but it seemed like a sign .
i operated on the same person you brought to the hospital .
that surely is a sign !
a sign we should live together .
come off it !
i' m sorry .
it was just a joke .
i wasn' t really serious .
i just wanted to ...
i have to go .
fine .
take it easy , bye .
bye !
that was not good .
i should' ve left god out of it .
that was not good .
so , you want me to pretend i' m your girlfriend ?
exactly .
mom would be really happy .
she' s really attached to me .
it wouldn' t be right .
she wants me to live well .
don' t you live well ?
i live like a pig .
a pig ?
don' t you have a girlfriend ?
nope .
couldn' t someone else do this ?
the point is that i look good .
i' m faithful to you .
we know each other well .
you respect me .
get it ?
do i say we' re getting married ?
that you can leave out .
you can say you liked my screenplay .
you wrote a screenplay ?
not yet , but you can say that .
hi , patient !
so , this is mom , and this is vesna .
hello .
shes my girlfriend .
i' m faithful to her .
we love each other .
does he still drink a lot ?
not anymore .
he' s improved .
are you still a buddhist ?
why haven' t you visited me ?
i was in bangkok .
where ?
in bangkok .
it' s in thailand .
did you sleep with prostitutes ?
no , i was writing a screenplay .
a screenplay ?
it' s very good .
really ?
see ?
he never lets me read anything .
did he smoke marijuana there ?
no , he quit .
he always says no when i offer .
you offer it to him ?
not anymore .
i quit , too .
he' s a good influence on me .
and on everyone else .
can i use the bathroom ?
what' s this supposed to mean ?
i needed a way to pick her up .
i said i wanted to cheer you up .
and she' s enjoying it .
aren' t you pleased that i' m so playful ?
not really .
but i get my inability to take things seriously from you .
it didn' t bother you at all when we used to cry as kids .
you told us to cry , that tears are a good oral disinfectant .
must you always joke around ?
you' re the one who' s joking .
you aren' t really sick .
will you ever love me ?
how can you expect to succeed if nothing is sacred to you ?
find a steady relationship .
i' m thinking of buying a dog .
gary gilmore was a mass murderer who received the death penalty .
he was also an organ donor , so strangers got his organs .
this song' s about the guy who was given gary' s eyes .
he had to look at life through gary gilmore' s eyes .
no , thanks .
i' m not interested .
hello .
do you have a lighter ?
yeah , i think so .
can i have a light ?
hang on .
i have to find it .
here it is .
hey , i have the same one !
goodbye .
do you want to go somewhere ?
like where ?
out for a drink ?
no , i don' t .
can i kiss you ?
yup .
isn' t there an extra charge ?
for what ?
i thought kissing was the most expensive .
i have no idea .
i guess that' s just in bangkok .
you were in bangkok ?
you bet .
really ?
yup .
tell me about it .
the whores are in aquariums .
cool .
how much do girls charge for tricks ?
fellatio' s 500 .
what ?
a blow job .
intercourse costs 500 or maybe 1000 .
sometimes you can get both for 1000 bahts .
that' s the same in czech crowns .
and kissing costs the most .
it' s at least 2500 .
2500 ?
you didn' t know that ?
nope .
did you ?
let' s not waste time chatting .
that' s intense .
slow down .
that' s harsh .
unbelievable ...
none of my friends could ever be president .
are those people your friends ?
yup .
ice ?
nope .
they' re all my friends , and they' re all living a lie .
they' re lucky i' m around to point that out to them .
that' s my project .
who' s that girl ?
a friend .
why ?
do you know her family ?
yeah .
pretty loony .
her mom' s especially crazed .
in what way ?
she acts like my mom .
why ?
so , you all know each other here .
why are you in this country ?
on account of ufos .
ufos .
yup .
the soil here is good , so they can fly low .
can' t they do that anywhere else ?
nope .
you' re insane !
i' ve never asked a girl this before , but what' s your sign ?
i was walking down an odd street ...
and i had the feeling i was in a foreign city like tokyo , japan
i' ve never been to tokyo , but i imagine it' s a cold place .
and that' s how i feel today .
gee , what happened ?
this song' s about what' s inside me to day .
are you coming to bed ?
you can turn off the light .
i broke up with my girl friend because ...
we just broke up ...
because we' re both looking for someone who won' t go looking for somebody else .
and until we find that person , we' il keep looking on our own .
it' s pretty complex .
i guess there' s no solution .
but that doesn' t matter .
that doesn' t matter ...
what ?
my back hurts , so i' m working out the kinks ...
you really scared us , you fool .
it' s a miracle you' re alive , but the doctors here are good .
good morning , doctor .
morning .
thanks on behalf of my brother .
i don' t have a brother .
i said , my brother .
you operated on him yesterday .
how can i ever repay you ?
that' s quite all right .
medicine fascinates me .
it' s just a job like any other .
what do you do ?
i' m a magician .
really ?
i can show you a trick .
this is not the right place .
it' il only take a second .
what' s in your pocket ?
here .
watch closely .
stop moving your hands around .
goodness , i' ve got to run .
doctor ?
this is for you .
that' s my card .
come see my magic show .
thank you .
hey !
hi !
what a coincidence .
it certainly is .
what' re you doing here ?
i was at the library .
how are you ?
i heard you and your boyfriend broke up .
where' d you hear that ?
on the radio .
we might get back together .
it was wise you lied to me .
you thought i' d go bananas again
iike when i used to put on disguises and follow you around .
i was thinking more of the time you almost set us on fire .
on fire ?
what do you mean ?
you heard me !
oh , that .
that was just a joke .
that was no joke !
don' t you remember ?
do you think i' d really set you on fire ?
i' m not insane .
i think you are !
wait !
can i give you a hug ?
no , you' d better not .
we must stop seeing each other .
i was thinking that myself .
even by chance .
you can say that again .
call me if you need help moving .
sorry , bad idea .
i take it back .
any thing else you want ?
no .
then i' m off .
bye ...
vesna isn' t just a great girl who knows how to summon ufos .
more importantly , she' s a master of the bodyshot .
show him !
that' s not agood idea .
i agree .
i' m more interested in ufos .
bodyshots are better .
you' re adj , and you don' t know what a bodyshot is ?
i don' t have to know everything .
lie down .
put salt behind your ear , tequila in your bellybutton .
put lemon in your mouth , and then vesna will drink it .
quit looking at each other !
i thought you were curious .
i am , but hanka' s on her way .
this is not a good idea .
okay , you' re right .
hanka !
wait !
sorry .
we were just drinking tequila like they do in mexico .
in mexico , huh ?
they drink it like that there .
it comes from cactuses .
why did you ask me here ?
it occurred to me that the guy you took to the hospital ...
... could' ve been a sign .
what kind of sign ?
i don' t know .
but it' s odd you found him the night you moved out .
that is odd .
maybe it was a sign that we should' ve stayed together .
or that we shouldn' t have .
or that we shouldn' t have .
a tequila sunrise and a bodyshot of tequila .
do you know what a bodyshot is ?
it' d make me happy .
honest .
i collect this stuff .
you collect guitar picks ?
i collect all sorts of stuff .
will you go with me ?
he' il be more likely to give you the pick if you' re alone .
anyway , he kept looking at you .
i' il wait here for you , okay ?
so , a guitar pick , right ?
and i want it autographed .
fine .
hi .
on aguitar pick .
what time do you get off work ?
everyones covered with lights .
lights ?
me , too ?
well ...
to be honest , not really .
that' s good .
isn' t it ?
it means that no one loves you .
your cell phones ringing .
why don' t you answer it ?
but i don' t have a cell phone .
hello ?
you bet .
i wanted to go , but it slipped my mind .
a guitar pick .
sure i' il bring one .
see you .
if i understand correctly , vesna promised her boyfriend a pick .
that' s why who' s here ?
that' s why i' m here .
because what do i know how to do ?
forge a famous guitarist' s autograph .
is that correct ?
yup .
did i do a good job ?
it looks great .
thanks .
my pleasure .
what do i owe you ?
the guys said you' re interested in ufos .
yup .
do you think they land here ?
no , but they fly close to here .
do they ?
if you hear about anything , i' d love to go with you .
i' m not sure .
why not ?
people go to africa to watch dolphins from boats .
they go to asia to watch rhinos on elephant back .
why couldn' t people watch ufos from a delivery truck here ?
a travel agency , get it ?
see old town in the morning ,
prague castle in the afternoon , and ufos at night .
want me to wait for you ?
no , you don' t have to .
thanks for offering .
hi !
hi !
can i come in ?
sure .
i wanted to introduce you two , anyway .
monika !
bartender monika , meet bartender vesna .
is she your sister ?
no .
does she look like my sister ?
you' re disgusting .
no , i' m not .
i like you , but everyone does this .
this is what you do .
this is just life .
your life .
we all fuck each other here .
there' s nothing sad about it .
vesna !
i have to get this on film .
relax ...
you' re an idiot !
hang on ...
czechs are nasty to each other because czech language is nasty .
czech is stupid .
the sounds are harsh , and it' s complicated .
it' s all perhaps , if ...
could and would .
no one knows how to say what they like to say .
would like to say .
would like to say .
and everyone tells lies .
they don' t smoke enough pot .
do you think that' s why ?
if they did , they' d lie less .
maybe they' d break up less .
getting high isn' t part of our culture yet .
maybe you' re right .
i just know this country is fucked up .
that' s for sure .
then again , every country is .
you can leave your shoes on .
really ?
hello !
did hanka send you ?
no , this was my idea .
did you hear what petr did ?
no .
he sent her packing .
did he ?
pretty cruel of him .
i' d say so .
may i videotape your house ?
of course .
i' m sorry .
that' s all right .
i' il just turn this on ...
is this for televsion ?
no .
i' m from a travel agency .
we specialize in japan .
japanese tourists want to see how typical czechs live .
would they come to our house ?
yes , with an interpreter .
if you' re interested we can go upstairs .
follow me .
do you talk ?
who ?
the two of us ?
do you talk during meals ?
yes , a little .
we talk a lot .
we' ve had some quiet applicants .
that' s not what we want .
actually we talk all the time .
right , dad ?
do you have a dog ?
no .
no problem .
we' il provide one .
get small dog that doesn' t she' d much .
hanka' s staying in this bedroom now .
and here' s the bathroom .
excellent .
you could walk the dog , watch some tv .
we could do that .
but the focus will be on food .
what do you mean ?
i' d say we' re going to eat .
exactly .
the japanese want to know how typical czechs act during meals .
come in .
am i disturbing you ?
not at all .
come in .
at the hospital you offered to pay me back .
and the offer still stands .
now there is something i need .
what is it ?
no , i' m sorry .
how would i do that ?
no , that wouldn' t work .
for my next trick i need a volunteer from the audience .
sir , why don' t you come up here ?
don' t worry .
come right up .
get inside .
don' t worry .
you' il be fine .
you' il be fine ...
perhaps .
this is ...
i' il shut the door .
am i to believe he disappeared ?
it sounds silly , doesn' t it ?
it sure does .
but it' s true .
this is a very bad joke .
ondrej has never pulled silly stunts like this .
i am not leaving until you give me my husband back .
good afternoon .
may i help you ?
are you mrs. cerna ?
yes .
i' ve come to inspect your gas appliances .
come in .
the gates open .
thank you , madam .
stop making those awful faces !
are they even going to watch me shave ?
we can still cancel out .
when you think about it , we could prevent wars .
in kosovo , say ?
doubtful .
but if the americans had visited vietnamese families ,
there wouldn' t have been a war .
wars break my heart .
i can' t bear to see those children and poor people .
and meanwhile we are so happy .
i' m not all that happy .
yes , you are .
happy is what those people will never be .
is everything all right ?
yes .
i didn' t even offer you a drink .
do i owe you anything ?
no , these inspections are free .
fine .
goodbye .
goodbye .
did we have company ?
no .
how do you explain the flowers in my room ?
which flowers ?
i don' t believe it .
actually , the gas man was here .
what did he want ?
he came to inspect the stove .
but we don' t have a gas stove .
hello ?
ondrej ?
not having a gas stove is no reason to get hysterical .
record your mother .
back to our contest .
a friend of mine likes surprising me .
sometimes it' s quite unpleasant , but now i' il surpise him .
recently he gave me a tape of his mother .
so , robert .
a big hello to you and your mom !
i' ve improved .
for example , i go by garbage cans without taking anything .
i had a mess tin here .
really ?
last time someone threw away a high power vacuum cleaner .
are you recording this ?
yup .
that' s good .
do you have anything to drink ?
otherwise i wouldn' t try ...
i left a high power vacuum cleaner there .
i see .
i didn' t even look at it .
how do you know it was a high power vacuum ?
there was a grinder here .
where' s the wine ?
did you see the grinder ?
nope .
it was in a box and there were some new boots on top of it .
brand new .
that' s how i knew the vacuum was good .
and i didn' t look at it or the boots .
because i knew god was just tempting me .
move over .
why do you collect this junk ?
my son is a disappointment and i want to be remembered for something .
you' re such a klutz .
would you go with them ?
i' il shoot the breeze with them .
but i' m not going anywhere .
it' s awesome here .
think so ?
you bet .
there are forty two civilizations in the universe , and we' re in last place .
measured by what ?
moral maturity ...
yeah .
we' re also the only planet where procreation requires only two beings .
so on the other planets you need three beings ?
no , seven .
of various sexes .
there are three of us .
so we' d need four more beings of totally different sexes .
right .
then maybe i will go .
why are we here , anyway ?
i guess we' re waiting for ufos .
right .
i forgot something in the car .
why are we here , anyway ?
you don' t really believe in ufos .
maybe not .
then why are you in prague ?
i came here to see dad .
dad ?
your dad ?
yup .
is he in this country ?
yup .
does he know about you ?
nope .
want to tell me about it ?
nope .
and i don' t want to start anything until i see him .
even though i like you .
understand ?
of course .
at times it' s easier to see a ufo than your own dad .
so , the macedonian beauty came here to look for her dad .
he' s from the czech republic , and she' s never seen him before .
so now i' m going to play some macedonian music .
because at times it' s easier to see a ufo than to live with the kind of girl i lived with for three years .
why did you live with me if it was that horrible ?
sorry , we were stoned .
you can' t always make excuses .
i' m not .
know what your problem is ?
you' ve never done anything for anyone .
you' ve never given up anything you like for anyone .
would you get a degree for someone ?
for you ?
this isn' t about me .
then who is this about ?
would you give up anything at all ?
of course .
something really important ?
do you want me to jump off a bridge for you ?
no , i just wanted you to be brave about our break up .
so i' d have a reason to respect you so i could come back to you .
so you wanted to come back to me because i broke up with you ?
yeah .
that' s great .
you' re just like your mother .
what ?
as station manager i am responsible for what you play .
i don' t care about your break up or your contest .
no one does .
tell me why you play this stuff .
my mother is ten times worse than what you' ve been playing .
radio is no private matter .
if i hear this stuff again , you can pack it in .
get it ?
yes .
i was afraid we' d never meet again .
nah , i knew we would .
how did you know that ?
because the guy pinned in the car was a sign .
a sign ?
we find a guy pinned in his car the first time we meet .
he was pinned in a car hed rolled .
didn' t that seem like a sign to you ?
yeah , i guess so .
it' s a clear sign that somethings going on between us .
the fact that you' re high is a sign you shouldn' t be driving .
get a load of these buildings .
aren' t they awesome ?
what city is this ?
dubrovnik ?
this is prague , you moron .
i know .
i was just testing you .
this is where i was born .
this is where i live .
but today it seems new .
it' s really nice .
tourists flip out over these buildings .
you can rip me off just like you do to tourists .
it sounds like you' re saying he steals .
so you really steal , huh ?
knock it off .
why ?
let him steal .
it' s awesome .
where' s he going ?
how can he drive from out there ?
ouch !
the golden age of moving is coming .
more and more people are moving to more and more new places .
i' m afraid of how it' il turn out .
but i' m not getting in the way .
i want to move with the times !
what do you want to be ?
a mover .
you already are one .
awesome .
then i' il keep my job !
my sincere condolences ...

ondrej , i don' t know how to get through to you .
look .
you' ve made a mess of your life , haven' t you ?
i' m offering you a way out .
what way ?
what can you offer me ?
you' re a psychopath !
don' t touch me !
you' re an addicted psychopath !
life with a psychopath might be your only way out .
or are you looking for someone who' il leave you in a year ?
let' s live together !
please !
i love you more than anything .
i know i act like an idiot .
that' s because of you .
i think of you when i' m walking down the street , at work ...
for lenka .
i can' t help it .
i think of you in so many places that i can' t even name them all .
i went to medical school so you would be proud of me .
i sometimes wish you' d fracture your thigh in a car accident ...
don' t touch me !
please !
don' t touch me !
hanka , i' m begging you !
that' s heavy stuff .
i understand you .
i' m a wreck , too .
can i give you a hug ?
me ?
just as friends .
what are you staring at ?
it wasn' t that big a deal .
i always stare like this .
don' t look at me .
he asked .
i wanted to answer him .
but you we' re looking at me .
so i was looking at you instead of at him .
whatever .
what did you bake ?
some excellent pastry .
i don' t want any pastry .
i just want to sit down .
some party .
i' d like something to drink .
we have some excellent pastry .
what is this ?
nothing .
did you set us on fire ?
no , i didn' t .
but we' re burning !
no , you aren' t .
everything' s just fine .
have a seat .
it' s all right .
holyshit !
this is warped !
holyshit !
this is unreal !
that was warped .
wasn' t it ?
please ...
i love you .
i think of you in so many places that i can' t even name them all .
i love you more than anything .
why did you film this ?
i don' t know .
i found it interesting .
interesting ?
yup .
it seems sad to me .
it is sad .
maybe that' s my problem .
i find sad things fascinating .
without sadness i feel nothing , and i can' t change .
that' s quite sad , isn' t it ?
yes , but it' s also fascinating .
you are a real idiot .
i' m sorry , hanka
scram !
we all need relationships .
someone who loves you .
someone who' il caress you when you' re down .
the world might be awesome , but sometimes it stinks .
and hanka' s sensitive .
she' s totally awesome .
i told her i love her and i want to live with her .
live with her ?
you already have a girlfriend .
say what ?
c' mon , alice .
alice who ?
you tell me .
i wouldn' t ...
oh yeah , alice .
but we broke up .
no , you didn' t .
but we saw her off at the train station .
she just went to germany to see her aunt .
you' re a total waste case .
you can' t even remember who you' re going out with .
do you even know your own name ?
listen , quit smoking pot .
do you want me to go schizo ?
i' il wait for you
i have to tell you something .
i thought we' d start going out , but the guys said i already had a girlfriend .
which guys ?
from the band .
then it all came back to me .
i' d totally forgotten about her .
you' re joking , right ?
no , i' m not .
i know it' s awful .
i' m sorry , but put yourself in my place .
life' s a bitch .
everything has turned against us .
i want to cry .
i love you , but i promised to stay with her .
i remember making that decision .
i don' t want to hurt anyone .
you don' t want to hurt anyone ?
i' m sorry .
it' s all that pot you smoke !
it' s that lifestyle of yours !
this is the last thing i' m gonna play for you .
this is also the last tape i have of my girlfriend .
this is her cough from march 3 , 1997 .
you can see how long we were together .
i guess we hurt each other .
but in any event ...
here' s a beautiful cough .
where have you been ?
we started without you .
where have you been ?
we started without you .
come on .
sit down .
what is this ?
beef .
with cranberries .
no , thanks .
i' m not hungry .
this is beef .
have some more dumplings .
they want to see how we eat .
isn' t this in the contract ?
can i talk to you in private ?
later , okay ?
the father is indicating that they can talk later .
what the hell is this ?
what' s she saying ?
watch your language !
stop snapping at me !
the daughter is surprised by the unusual situation .
i' m not afraid to slap you !
i came to see you because i feel awful and i need to talk to you .
yet what do i find here ?
do you know why you feel awful ?
it' s that lifestyle of yours .
the daughter wants advice on how
to deal with the fact that a married man is stalking her .
it those friends of yours .
you don' t even know them .
seeing them is enough .
isn' t it odd for a girl your age to move all the time ?
quiet !
seeing you breaks my heart .
you break my heart too , mom .
stop it !
this is unbearable .
the parents object to having this kind of discussion today .
kindly realize that life isn' t that easy .
i see .
what ?
you have an obligation .
we' ve had to make sacrifices .
well i have , out of love !
you don' t even know what that means because your friends ...
... never make sacrifices for you .
i don' t want them to !
and they don' t !
you people don' t live life .
you just slice it !
the mother thinks the daughter is to blame for her own problems .
i like women as people .
i' m just not going to sleep with them anymore .
if i ever do meet a girl , for the first 146 days we' re just going to talk .
146 days .
that' s important .
it can' t be less than that .
then maybe i' il give her a kiss .
but until i find that kind of girl i' m going to be alone .
not everyone has the chance to be alone like i have .
good morning .
good morning .
have you already started ?
did you wash your hands ?
yes .
i saw the video .
which video ?
from robert' s party .
i was quite shocked .
it was just an ordinary party .
you have a few drinks , and then act crazy .
you dance and laugh .
should i pack my things ?
of course not .
have a seat .
i think we have a good relationship .
do you ?
of course .
you buy us nice christmas gifts .
you don' t smoke or drink .
you' re faithful to me , reliable .
and you love us .
do you think so ?
of course you love us .
did you think you loved her ?
yes , i did .
sometimes it' s hard to figure out what you want on your own .
you think you want to live with someone else .
yet what you really want is to dress up as a plumber .
why , that' s me .
i didn' t know the problem was your attraction to overalls .
you can wear them at home .
thanks , but i don' t think that' s the main problem .
perhaps the hospital would even let you wear them to work .
no .
well , maybe .
but promise you' il think about it .
fine , i' il think about it .
bon appetit .
bon appetit .
bon appetit !
i get high because the world is cruel and people are lonely .
i work so i can buy drugs that make people seem kind , friendly , free , and beautiful .
trouble is these drugs probably caused me to hurt someone .
so it doesn' t make sense for me to do them anymore .
i' ve had it with drugs .
i' m giving up weed .
this is my last joint .
i' m not even going to finish it .
what' s she like ?
she' s a bit selfish and tough , and she never gives up without a fight .
is it even worth the effort ?
yeah .
give it a try .
hi !
hi !
pretty good , huh ?
it occurred to me that the guy i took to the hospital ...
... really could' ve been a sign .
what kind of sign ?
