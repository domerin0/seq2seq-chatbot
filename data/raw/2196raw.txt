in short , ladies and gentlemen of the board ... ... costs are down , revenues are up ... ... and our stock has never been higher .
wonderful news , norman .
that' s why we' re selling the company .
what ?
quest is recapitalizing in the wake of the bombing .
expanding .
they made a tender offer we can' t ignore .
why wasn' t i told ?
they don' t want a power struggle with entrenched management .
the deal is off if you come with it .
the board expects your resignation in 30 days .
you can' t do this to me .
i started this company .

i' m sorry .
sleep tight .

she' s all right .
she' s just a little rattled .
look , pete , i should have told you about us .
but you should know i' m crazy about her .
it' s just , you know , you never made a move .
you' re right .
i didn' t .
i' m gonna get some rest .
i' m gonna stay up for a while .
what was that thing ?
i don' t know .
whatever it is , somebody has to stop it .
somebody there ?
somebody .
who said that ?
don' t play the innocent with me .
you' ve known all along .
where are you ?
follow the cold shiver running down your spine .
i' m right here .
i don' t understand .
did you think it was coincidence ?
so many good things , all happening for you .
all for you .
norman .
what do you want ?
to say what you won' t .
to do what you can' t .
to remove those in your way .
the board members .
you killed them .
we killed them .
we ?
remember ?
your little accident in the laboratory .
the performance enhancers .
bingo .
me !
your greatest creation .
power beyond your wildest dreams .
and it' s only the beginning .
there' s only one who can stop us .
or imagine if he joined us .
spider man .
and the green goblin .
the green goblin .
you like that ?
made it up myself .
these weirdos all got to have a name .
mr. jameson
hoffman !
yeah ?
copyright " green goblin .
i want a quarter every time it' s said .
how about " green meanie " ?
spider man wasn' t attacking .
that' s slander .
it is not .
i resent that .
slander is spoken .
in print , it' s libel .
you don' t trust anybody .
i trust my barber .
are you his lawyer ?
let him sue .
get rich like a normal person .
that' s what made this country
jameson , you slime .
who takes the pictures of spider man ?
i don' t know .
his stuff comes by mail .
liar !
i swear .
he' s the one who can bring me to him .
i don' t know who he is .
you are useless .
set him down , tough guy .
speak of the devil .
i knew you two were in this together !
kiddo , let mom and dad talk for a minute .
sleep ....
wake up , little spider .
wake up .
no , you' re not dead yet .
just paralyzed ... ... temporarily .
you' re an amazing creature , spider man .
you and i are not so different .
i' m not like you .
you' re a murderer .
well , to each his own .
i chose my path , you chose the way of the hero .
and they found you amusing for a while , the people of this city .
but the one thing they love more than a hero ... ... is to see a hero fail , fall , die trying .
in spite of everything you' ve done for them , eventually , they will hate you .
why bother ?
because it' s right .
here' s the real truth .
there are eight million people in this city .
and those teeming masses exist for the sole purpose ... ... of lifting the few exceptional people onto their shoulders .
you , me ... ... we' re exceptional .
i could squash you like a bug right now .
but i' m offering you a choice .
join me .
imagine what we could accomplish together .
what we could create .
or we could destroy .
cause the deaths of countless innocents in selfish battle ... ... again and again and again until we' re both dead .
is that what you want ?
think about it , hero .
in spite of everything you' ve done for them , eventually , they will hate you .
it' s me again .
how was your audition ?
how' d you know ?
the hot line .
your mom ... ... told my aunt , told me .
so you just came by ?
i was in the neighborhood .
needed to see a friendly face .
i took two buses and a cab to get in the neighborhood , but ....
so how' d it go ?
they said i needed acting lessons .
a soap opera told me i needed acting lessons .
let me buy you a cheeseburger .
the sky' s the limit , up to $7 . 84 .
i' d like a cheeseburger .
oh , but i' m going out to dinner with harry .
come with us .
no , thanks .
how' s it going with ... ?
never mind .
that' s none of my business .
it' s not ?
why so interested ?
i' m not .
you' re not ?
well , why would i be ?
i don' t know .
why would you be ?
i , that' s a
i don' t know .
sorry you won' t come with us .
i' d better run , tiger .
hey , check it out , man .
come on , man .
hey , where you going , baby ?

wait !
you have a knack for getting in trouble .
you have a knack for saving my life .
i think i have a superhero stalker .
i was in the neighborhood .
you are amazing .
some people don' t think so .
but you are .
nice to have a fan .
do i get to say thank you this time ?
wait .

my baby' s in there !

the roof' s collapsing !
somebody save my baby !
the roof' s about to collapse !
look !

it' s okay .
your baby' s fine .
oh , my baby !
god bless you , spider man .

hold it !
you' re under arrest .
i' m taking you in .
oh , my god , there' s somebody still up there !
i' m going .
i' il be here when you get back .
not coming back .
go !
go !
where are you ?
where are you ?
i' m gonna get you out of here !
it' s okay .
you' re pathetically predictable .
like a moth to the flame .
what about my generous proposal ?
are you in or are you out ?
it' s you who' s out .
out of your mind .
wrong answer .
oh , great .
no one says no to me !
m. j. , will you stop goofing around ?
harry , relax .
he' s here .
are you ready ?
aunt may .
i' m sorry i' m late .
work was murder .
i picked up a fruitcake .
thank you , mr. osborn .
we' re so glad you could come .
who is this lovely young lady ?
i' d like you to meet my father .
dad , this is mary jane watson .
i' ve been looking forward to meeting you .
happy thanksgiving , sir .
now , where is peter ?
he' d better remember that cranberry sauce .
oh , that' s weird .
i didn' t know he was here .
peter ?
is that you ?
how strange .
there' s nobody here .
bit of a slob , isn' t he ?
all brilliant men are .
hey , everyone .
oh , peter !
it' s a jungle out there .
had to beat an old lady with a stick to get these cranberries .
thank you .
now then , everybody sit down ... ... and we can say grace .
here we go .
there we are .
it looks delicious .
will you do the honors ?
why , peter , you' re bleeding .
i stepped off a curb and got clipped by one of those bike messengers .
well , let me see .
oh , my goodness .
that looks awful .
no , it' s nothing .
i' il get the first aid kit .
then we' il say grace .
this is the boys ' first thanksgiving here , and we' il do things properly .
how did you say that happened ?
bike messenger .
knocked me down .
if you' il excuse me , i' ve got to go .
why ?
something has come to my attention .
are you all right ?
i' m fine , just fine .
thank you , mrs. parker .
everyone .
enjoy the fruitcake .
dad !
i planned this so you' d meet m. j. , and now you have to leave ?
i' ve got to go .
this girl is important to me .
harry , please .
look at her .
think she' s sniffing around because she likes your personality ?
what are you saying ?
your mother was beautiful .
they' re all beautiful until they' re snarling after your money like wolves .
you' re wrong , dad .
do what you need to with her , then broom her fast .
thanks for sticking up for me , harry .
you heard ?
everyone heard that creep .
that creep is my father .
with luck , i' il be half of what he is .
shut up about stuff you don' t understand !
harry osborn !
i' m sorry , aunt may .
spider man is all but invincible .
but parker , we can destroy him .
i can' t .
betrayal must not be countenanced .
parker must be educated .
what do i do ?
instruct him in the matters of loss and pain .
make him suffer .
make him wish he were dead .
yes ?
and then grant his wish .
but how ?
the cunning warrior attacks neither body nor mind .
tell me how !
the heart , osborn .
first , we attack his heart .
give us this day our daily bread , and forgive us our trespasses ... ... as we forgive those who trespass against us .
lead us not into temptation , but deliver us
deliver us !
finish it !
finish it !
from evil !
two milligrams iv .
get the bp .
aunt may .
is she gonna be okay ?
what happened ?
you have to leave .
what happened ?
those eyes !
those horrible yellow eyes !
he knows who i am .
i' m sorry .
will she be okay ?
she' il be fine .
she' s been sleeping all day .
thanks for coming .
of course .
how are you ?
you okay about the other night ?
yeah , i' m fine .
i just felt bad about leaving aunt may .
have you talked to harry ?
he called me .
i haven' t called him back .
the fact is ... ... i' m in love with somebody else .
you are ?
at least i think i am .
it' s not the time to talk about it .
no .
go on .
would i know his name , this guy ?
you' il think i' m a little girl with a crush .
trust me .
it' s funny .
he' s saved my life twice , and i' ve never even seen his face .
oh .
him .
you' re laughing at me .
no , i understand .
he is extremely cool .
but do you think it' s true , all the terrible things they say ?
not spider man , not a chance in the world .
i know him a little bit .
i' m sort of his unofficial photographer .
has he mentioned me ?
yeah .
what' d he say ?
i said ....
he asked me what i thought about you .
and what did you say ?
i said , " spider man .
i said , " the great thing about m. j ... ... is ... ... when you look in her eyes ... ... and she' s looking back in yours ... ... everything feels ... ... not quite normal .
because you feel ... ... stronger ... ... and weaker at the same time .
you feel excited ... ... and at the same time ... ... terrified .
the truth is , you don' t know what you feel ... ... except you know what kind of man you want to be .
it' s as if you' ve ... ... reached the unreachable ... ... and you weren' t ready for it .
you said that ?
well , something like that .
dad ?
dad , is that you ?
what is it ?
you were right about m. j. you' re right about everything .
she' s in love with peter .
parker ?
yeah .
and how does he feel about her ?
he' s loved her since the 4th grade .
he pretends like he doesn' t , but there' s no one peter cares for more .
i' m so sorry .
i haven' t always been there for you , have l ?
you' re busy .
you' re an important man .
i understand .
that' s no excuse .
i' m proud of you .
i' ve lost sight of that somewhere .
but i' il make it up to you .
i' m going to rectify certain inequities .
wake up , little spider .
wake up .
go home , dear .
you look awful .
and you look beautiful .
thank you .
i don' t like to leave you here .
but i' m safe here .
can i do anything for you ?
you do too much .
college , a job , all this time with me .
you' re not superman , you know .
a smile .
finally .
haven' t seen one of those on your face since mary jane was here .
you were supposed to be asleep .
you know , you were about 6 years old when m. j. ' s family moved in next door .
when she got out of the car , and you saw her for the first time ... ... you grabbed me and said , " aunt may , is that an angel ?
gee , did i say that ?
you sure did .
well , harry' s in love with her .
she' s still his girl .
well , isn' t that up to her ?
she doesn' t really know who i am .
because you won' t let her .
you' re so mysterious all the time .
tell me , would it be so dangerous ... ... to let mary jane know how much you care ?
everybody else knows .
i' il be right back .
but ....
come on , pick up .
hey , m. j. sing your song at the beep .
m. j. , it' s peter .
you there ?
hello ?
you there ?
i' m just calling to check up on you .
will you call me when you get in ?
all right , well ....
don' t ....
don' t go up any dark alleys .
hello ?
can spider man come out to play ?
where is she ?
what is that ?
that' s cool !
the itsy bitsy spider went up the water spout
down came the goblin and took the spider out
goblin , what have you done ?
spider man !
this is why only fools are heroes .
let die the woman you love ...
... or suffer the little children .
spider man !
save us !
save us !
make your choice , spider man ... ... and see how a hero is rewarded .
don' t do it , goblin !
we are who we choose to be .
now , choose !
no !
everybody stay still !
ahoy up there !
we' re gonna bring the barge right under you .
he' s coming back !
listen .
i need you to climb down .
i can' t .
yes , you can !
m. j. , you can do it .
you have to .
trust me .
hold on tight and go quickly .
hurry !
i can' t .
i can' t do it .
hang on , mary jane !
he' s not gonna make it .
he' s gonna make it !
it' s time to die .
i got something for you !
we ought to kick your ass !
leave spider man alone !
you' d pick on a guy saving kids ?
you mess with spidey , you mess with new york !
you mess with one of us , you mess with all of us !
spider man , watch out !
misery , misery , misery .
that' s what you' ve chosen .
i offered you friendship ... ... and you spat in my face .
you' ve spun your last web , spider man .
had you not been so selfish , your girlfriend' s death ... ... would have been quick .
but now that you' ve really pissed me off ... ... i' m gonna finish her nice and slow .
m. j. and i ... ... we' re gonna have a hell of a time .
peter , stop !
stop !
it' s me .
mr. osborn .
thank god for you .
you killed those people on that balcony .
the goblin killed !
i had nothing to do with it !
don' t let him take me again .
i beg you .
protect me .
you tried to kill aunt may .
you tried to kill mary jane .
but not you .
i tried to stop it .
but i couldn' t stop it .
i would never hurt you .
i knew from the beginning ... ... if anything ever happened to me ... ... it was you i could count on .
you , peter parker , would save me , and so you have .
thank god for you .
give me your hand .
believe in me as i believed in you .
i' ve been like a father to you .
be a son to me now .
i have a father .
his name was ben parker .
godspeed , spider man .
peter .
don' t tell harry .
what have you done ?
what have you done ? !
i' m so sorry , harry .
i know what it' s like to lose a father .
i didn' t lose him .
he was stolen from me .
one day spider man will pay .
i swear on my father' s grave , spider man will pay .
thank god for you , peter .
you' re the only family i have .
no matter what i do ... ... no matter how hard i try ... ... the ones i love will always be the ones who pay .
you must miss him so much .
it' s been so hard without him .
there' s something i' ve been wanting to tell you .
when i was up there ... ... and i thought i was gonna die ... ... there was only one person who i was thinking of .
and it wasn' t who i thought it' d be .
it was you , pete .
i hope i make it through this ... ... so i can see peter parker' s face one more time .
really ?
there' s only one man who' s always been there for me ... ... who makes me feel ... ... like i' m more than i ever thought i could be .
that i' m just ... ... me .
and that' s okay .
the truth is ... ... i love you .
i love you so much , peter .
all i wanted was to tell her how much i loved her .
i can' t ....
you can' t what ?
tell you ... ... everything .
i mean , there' s so much to tell .
yeah .
there' s so much to tell .
i want you to know ... ... that i will always be there for you .
i will always be there to take care of you .
i promise you that .
i will always be your friend .
only a friend ... ... peter parker ?
that' s all i have to give .
with great power comes great responsibility .
this is my gift .
my curse .
who am i ?
i' m spider man .
