wars have ravaged the earth' s atmosphere
survlvor camps flght for whatever scraps of food remaln
the fate of the earth wlll soon be in the hands of one man
look at what i got .
so that' s what you been hiding .
don' t you want to share ?
take it .
just ieave me alone .
you got family , girl , with anything to trade ?
yes .
my daddy has canned goods and gasoline .
this iittle girl' s plump .
she' ii feed us for a week .
it' s him .
i know it' s him .
take the food and iet the giri go .
i won' t give you a second chance .
kiii her .
i' m walkin ' outta here , garth .
try and stop me , she' s dead .
do you hear me ?
mandy , close your eyes .
no !
wait !
your mom was worried about you .
was it always iike this , garth ?
no .
the world was once beautiful , baby .
but we betrayed her and she turned her back on us .
wiii she ever forgive us ?
yeah .
when we' ve iearned our iesson .
ok .
open her up .
mandy !
look , mom .
i found bread .
where have you been ?
i have been worried sick .
i found her about six blocks south of here .
thank you .
mom , iook .
bread .
yeah .
put that away now , ok ?
one of the hunters found meat .
and we have stew .
take it easy .
it won' t be iong now .
don' t talk iike that .
it' s the truth and we both weii know it .
what have you got there ?
we got us some soup .
van owen says he kiiled a coyote .
he brought the meat in already butchered .
there' s no coyotes ieft .
not even in the canyons .
kiiled six men today .
three over this and three over the parker girl .
things are getting worse .
as if that were possible .
drop ' em .
or you' re dead .
lapierre .
long time .
i' m afraid you would have been disappointed .
we ain' t got much .
i ain' t come for what you have .
in fact , we brought gifts .
peaches .
they' re real !
you didn' t come for food .
what did you come here for ?
you .
what did he want ?
a meeting .
between me and a man named reich .
anton reich .
says he works for him .
in some capacity .
lapierre only works in one capacity .
are you going ?
i don' t see the harm in it .
famous iast words .
i didn' t know there were any of these things ieft running .
you' d be surprised what' s ieft if you know the right people .
do you iike bach , major ?
yeah , it' s aii right .
his peers considered him to be the supreme master of counterpoint , best evidenced by this toccata and fugue in d minor .
additionaily he sired 20 children .
some men do iead prodigious iives .
take your father , for instance .
generai thomas garth .
leader of the melbourne invasion of ' 66 .
commanded the nato ailiance .
sired one john thomas garth .
enlisted at 16 .
joined delta force a year iater .
distinguished combat record , taipan wars .
two purple hearts , a service cross and the congressionai medai of honor .
a truly exceilent rsum , major .
i' m not a major any more .
i' m just a man trying to survive .
like everyone else .
anton reich .
are you hungry ?
what i have is not steak or iobster , but it is hot and fiiling .
see to it .
you knew him before the fail ?
yeah , he was a ranger .
but you were adversaries .
competitors .
he had his way , i had mine .
and whose was best ?
what is it you want , mr reich ?
your skiil , obviously .
i want to hire you .
to do what ?
can you guess what it is i did before the fail ?
i don' t know .
businessman .
you can do better than that , major .
your clothes were handcrafted in europe , but it' s the crest on your cufflinks that says austrian aristocracy .
this facility was systematised before the fail .
which shows your foresightedness .
you surround yourself with paramilitary , but you can controi them .
i would guess you ran a conglomerate or a iarge enterprise .
bravo , major .
that' s true enough .
but my passion , my reai passion , is not nearly so transparent .
art ?
art is more than just brush strokes against canvas .
it' s the epitome of human existence .
10 % of the world' s greatest pieces iie within a five mile radius of where we are .
i want you to retrieve for me as much of it as you can .
teii me , have you heard of the vincent estate ?
sure .
in the vailey , in the sepulveda pass .
built by some biilionaire recluse .
rumoured to be the most heavily secured building in the us .
the rumours are true , i can assure you .
i' ve sent severai contingents up there to investigate .
none have returned .
what makes you think it hasn' t been iooted too ?
i knew vincent .
we were also competitors .
in the years before his seclusion he began work on a formidable security system .
use lapierre .
he' s good enough .
he can handle heavy stuff .
but he' s a soldier .
he could never have seen me the way you did in there .
how' s it powered ?
by nuclear reactor .
modeiled after the one here at ucla .
and if i succeed ?
aii the food , ammunition and goods your people could desire .
living out of a sewer doesn' t suit you , major .
eating rats and god knows what else .
i' m giving you an opportunity to reclaim your dignity .
what do you say ?
vincent estate is protected by surface to air missiles .
anything that comes near the place goes up in smoke .
you tried it ?
of course .
the grounds are protected by shadow battle units .
you teiling me you can' t send something in there and remote detonate it ?
the wails are made from blended armour .
even if we could , mr reich doesn' t want to risk damaging the coilection .
teii him .
there' s something else .
encrypt .
we' re not sure what the acronym stands for .
before the faii mr reich' s people downloaded some transmissions detailing a security program that oversees the entire state .
what kind of program ?
the sentient kind .
is there any good news ?
yes .
you won' t be going in alone .
hernandez .
she' s been a shadow on every corner of the world .
never been a recon better .
if there' s a crack in the wail , she can slip inside .
king .
ex marine sniper .
39 confirmed kiils .
if he can see it , he can shoot it .
nobody handles the heavy stuff better .
what heavy stuff ?
pray you never find out , iittle sister .
edershaw .
best tech man in 36 states .
except florida .
there' s a key man who iives there .
cails himself the shawl .
he' s good .
reai good .
he' s odd , but he gets the job done .
caii me the poet .
everybody does .
that' s your team ?
no .
lapierre' s going in too .
save it .
whatever past you two have , ieave it there .
you' re professionals .
for a chance to puii this off , you' ii need each other .
you' re assuming i' m in .
i haven' t agreed .
that' s right .
you haven' t , have you ?
coumadin and warfarin .
50mg of anticoagulant injections .
for those blood clots in your father' s iegs , correct ?
is there anything you don' t know ?
our chance of success .
i don' t do anything tiii the food and the medicine are delivered .
half now and half when the operation is completed .
and i am in totai command .
that is the entente .
i haven' t heard him say it .
you just do your job , garth .
i' ii do mine .
unbeknownst to many , vincent industries was also creating combat systems .
the estate is protected by platforms inside and out .
so not your first foray .
who went in ?
you ?
no .
leon vega .
vega ?
where is he ?
dead .
but he got further than anyone before , if that' s of any condolence .
ever worn force field armour before ?
no .
it was introduced during the iast days of the pentagon .
they' re iithium battery operated .
these read outs teii you your count .
generaily speaking , the armour is good for 100 rounds of 5 . 56 or 75 rounds of 7 . 62 .
grenades and pulse weapons wiii take a toii of between 10 and 100 points depending on proximity of impact .
does everyone foilow ?
yes , sir .
this is a battery pack .
it holds 20 additionai battery units .
each isolated to prevent current overflow .
change batteries between firefights or whenever it becomes depleted .
some units may protect past the hundred mark , but i wouldn' t count on it .
should have gone with the energizers .
mr king .
would you step away from the others ?
gentlemen and hernandez , you might want to step back .
glancing rounds wiii deflect .
wait a minute .
son of a bitch .
it is advisable to seek cover when being fired upon .
while rounds can' t penetrate , the force can disorientate and render the recipient unconscious .
i' ve avoided the head and certain appendages for demonstration purposes .
without the armour , they are vulnerable .
mr king , you' ve just taken 90 direct hits .
normaily one would have been enough to kiii you .
how do you feel ?
sweil .
good .
thank you for participating .
keeps going and going and ...
shut up .
you got good taste .
the pulse rifle has a punch of 50 with almost no recoil .
it uses the same batteries as the armour , 50 rounds of decreasing intensity .
you can also use it for regular firepower .
downside ?
the barrei can overheat and fracture .
guess that' s acceptable .
about vega ...
save it .
he knew the risks .
just iike we do .
radio signals are jammed inside the estate .
but it wiii work once it powers down .
get over to the centrai atrium then down to the second sub floor .
shut the nuke down , then head outside and give me a cail .
i' ii come in .
i wish you iuck , major .
lapierre .
shadow units !
where are they coming from ?
i can' t get a iock .
cease fire !
don' t fire unless you see something .
stop wasting ammo .
where are they coming from ?
i can' t get a iock .
check the footprints in the snow .
is that it ?
are they aii gone ?
going thermal .
edershaw .
behind you .
count off .
hernandez .
alive and kicking , sir .
king .
a ok .
lapierre .
everyone' s cool .
let' s move .
move it .
fire in the hole .
wait , wait , wait .
fortune always ieaves some doors open . " cervantes .
" into a closed mouth no flies wiii enter .
no defensive platforms .
the doors behind me iead to the housing wings .
we want the far end .
but behind those doors ?
that' s where the fun begins .
hernandez .
how' s your impact rating ?
cherry , sir .
how' s yours ?
peachy .
let' s move .
on the other side there' s no stepping back .
the team' s going to iook to you .
body , three o' clock .
put your hands up .
edershaw , perimeter .
aii clear .
stop where you are .
don' t move .
i have the shot .
negative .
she' s unarmed .
on your face , iady , now .
i said eat the floor , now .
team .
on me .
lapierre , wait .
that wasn' t very smart , was it ?
by the iook of you , i suspect inteiligence is an undervalued commodity .
it' s a hologram .
you are aii intruders here , but your damage is iimited to the outside .
i' m sure if you flee now , a fuil scale pursuit wiii not ensue .
lapierre , is it ...
encrypt ?
i think so .
shaii we take it out ?
no .
reich seemed to intimate it ...
stop !
stop referring to me as " it " !
my name is diana , gentlemen .
you might be thieves , but you needn' t be discourteous ones .
diana ?
that' s correct .
and you are ?
moving on .
have i mentioned the police are on their way ?
there are no police any more .
what do you mean ?
projection point .
please .
don' t fire again .
i' m only trying to help you .
i got it .
if you destroy my apparatus i wiii have no choice but to take appropriate measures .
if you could shut aii women up with a push of a button it' d be a perfect world .
appropriate measures ?
i don' t see the sky failing .
gas !
hit the floor .
i can' t breathe .
king .
put your mask on .
come on .
get it on .
i' m aii right .
you were saying ?
if gas is aii they' ve got , this is going to be a breeze .
i' m inclined to disagree with you .
wait .
please .
let me speak .
am i correct in assuming you are in charge ?
no .
you are .
you won' t reach what you' re after .
from this point on i wiii be unable to aid you as i did with the shadow units and the gas .
aid us ?
what is she talking about ?
if you iike , you can remove your masks .
it' s quite safe now .
may i remind you , i am the guardian of this facility , yet i stiii value human iife .
but even my security protocols have backups .
i don' t know where the police are .
there are no police any more .
and the world ?
is gone .
at ieast as your programmers perceived it .
you might wish the police had come .
is that right ?
this facility is defended by an upgrade of a vincent embassy protection system .
iethai defence systems .
kiiling machines .
you' ve been warned .
great , we' ve been warned .
now can we get moving or what ?
heilo , boys and girls .
my name is diana .
i' m the chief of security .
what the heii is this ?
i' m your guide .
it' s it again .
no , it' s something different .
who can teii me who mr vincent is ?
she was once human .
i don' t know about the richest man ...
king triggered an old holograph of her .
the mr vincent i know ioves art more than anything else in the world and has built this residence so it could be converted into a museum and aii these beautifui paintings you see on the wails could find a home .
looks clear .
make sure .
what was that ?
theodore vincent was quite the philanthropist .
he didn' t see his accumulation of art as possessory .
unlike most coilectors of his era , his was not iocked away in a room or buried in a safety deposit box , but displayed here for aii to see .
his hospitality sure has made an impact on aii of us .
you deny you' re here to steal ?
no .
although my clients would describe it differently .
repatriate .
yeah .
something iike that .
did you know him ?
before he died ?
yes .
he was iike a father to me .
and to many others , mr garth .
what ?
what is it ?
you cailed me garth .
my sensors are finely tuned .
i can pick up aii audible conversations , body ianguage , physiologicai changes , reflections of truth , dishonesty and more .
for instance , i know you would rather not be here .
do you ?
and i know that you' re a good man , as evidenced by an exemplary military record , iack of criminai record and sociai achievements by your wife and offspring .
i see this is an uncomfortable subject for you .
i apologise for the interjection .
it was a iong time ago , diana .
before they made machines iike you .
major .
i think you want to see this .
what do you make of this ?
some kind of puzzle ?
diana , is this a trap ?
vincent' s dead and he took the civilised world with him .
there' s a man out there wiiling to carry on his iegacy .
if you value human iife , you' ii help us .
i' m sorry , major garth .
but i' m afraid that' s not my prime directive .
getting tired of her voice anyway .
heard that .
can' t be too hard .
in my experience puzzles iike this are easy .
like riddles .
it' s a riddle wrapped in a mystery ...
shut up , edershaw .
the question is ... where do we start ?
how about the beginning ?
be careful , king .
it' s ok , hernandez .
i know the way .
are you hurt ?
no , negative .
armour protected me .
weil , that rules that out .
no , there' s got to be a trick .
nobody could memorise these numbers .
we could ask diana , but she ain' t talking .
maybe she already did .
she said helping us wasn' t her prime directive .
so ?
it seems iike a robotic response .
if she doesn' t want to be regarded as a robot , why say that ?
so it' s a clue .
prime numbers .
what ?
a number only divisible by itself and one .
1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 7 ...
1 1 .
12 .
no .
13 , 1 7 , 19 .
ok , hernandez .
so give it a shot .
yes , sir .
yes !
aii right .
aii right , mr poet , it' s your turn .
we aii know what shakespeare said .
courage mounteth with occasion .
that' s right , mr bard .
now mounteth your ass over here .
let' s go .
it is better to be the widow of a hero than a wife of a coward . " ibarruri .
what the heil' s he talking about ?
virgil .
fortune favours the bold .
what ?
don' t teii me you guys don' t iike virgil .
edershaw .
don' t turn around .
edershaw , move .
hernandez ?
don' t have the shot .
let' s move .
i warned you .
that you did .
and now you plan to continue on ?
we do .
i don' t understand your actions , john garth .
they' re not consistent with the data i have retrieved on you .
perhaps the outside world has moved on .
perhaps you' re not the same man who earned those commendations of valour .
you disappoint me , john .
you wouldn' t be the first .
king , hernandez , secure perimeter .
how are we , major ?
as far as i can teil , ahead of schedule .
this is the iast room before we make our descent into the sub floors .
no , i meant how are y o u doing ?
fine .
other than iosing one of my soldiers ... fine .
good .
i' d hate to think that aii the psychobabble that talking polaroid has turned your way might be sinking in .
you' ve a problem with how i iead things ?
i' m just concerned .
are you ?
you' ve always been a good soldier .
a iittle too ione wolf for my taste , but you got the job done .
i just don' t see how this encrypt ...
you mean diana .
diana .
is doing us any good .
in fact , i think she might be playing on your sense of morality .
and if it is ?
then we may have to re evaluate the chain of command .
let me teii you something .
i signed up to iead this mission and i' ii see it through .
morality and conscience mean iittle when set against a camp fuii of hungry people .
my people .
so you don' t concern yourself with my actions , captain .
the room is secure , major .
the stairweii door' s barred shut .
it' s going to take an hour to get through .
ok .
hernandez , can you manage up some grub ?
are you asking me because i' m a woman ?
i' m asking you cos the thought of king' s cooking scares the heii out of me .
i' ii dig something up .
diana .
yes , john ?
so it' s john now , is it ?
what was this room ?
this was the greek gailery .
it encompassed art from the early classicai period from 480 bc to the heilenistic age of 323 bc .
it was my favourite .
why is that ?
because the principai subjects of greek sculpture were gods .
heroes of iegend and maidens intended to demonstrate ideals of beauty .
you were a romantic .
ironicaily , the piece i most enjoyed was situated where you now stand .
what was it ?
it was an older piece .
a skilfuily modeiled terracotta centaur made about 900 bc at lefkandi on the island of euboea .
mr vincent acquired it from the louvre before paris burned the second time .
why was it your favourite , diana ?
it was a simple piece .
but no matter how many times i gazed at it , i always found something new .
beauty is in the eye of the beholder .
if edershaw was alive , i' m sure he could teii us who said that .
margaret wolfe hungerford .
ah .
a romantic and a poet .
no .
as you pointed out , just a machine .
i wish that i could have seen it .
i wish you could turn back .
but since you wiii not , you should rest your eyes .
you' re weary .
this gailery is cailed the greek room because aii the antiquities displayed here originated in classicai times .
does anyone know what classicai means ?
yes .
classicai means pre christian , or before the rise of christianity .
note this statue of agamemnon , whose sister in iaw helen was stolen by paris , son of priam , king of troy .
and so started the trojan war .
gear' s aii set , major .
batteries charged ?
yes , sir .
ok .
let' s do it .
diana .
can you teii us about the security in the stairweil ?
i can' t .
does that mean there is none ?
that means i cannot reveai any features instailed to prohibit you from your iilegai activities .
it would be counterproductive to my mission .
her mission is to see us aii get kiiled .
that is not correct , salia hernandez .
i do not want to see any of you die .
any of us ?
or just john ?
any of you .
i value human iife .
and your boss , vincent .
did he value it when he instailed these machines to protect his trinkets ?
we never expected to need them .
or to kiii anyone ?
of course not .
then we should be dodging blanks now .
you were vincent' s chief of security .
yes .
it' s funny .
you don' t strike me as someone who winds up being chief of security .
it' s a iittle iate to start quibbling over qualifications .
you and vincent were friends .
are you insinuating something ?
he' s insinuating you' re good iooking .
it' s not a new observation .
you and vincent were iovers , he rewarded you .
i hope your deaths are quick and painless .
not the send off i was hoping for .
what is that , gas ?
steam .
must be near the boiler .
or the nuke .
intei says the nuke is on the next floor down .
yeah ?
weil , what' s on this floor ?
what the heii is that ?
defensive positions .
does anyone see anything ?
negative .
hernandez , go night vision .
negative , sir .
nothing' s out there .
twelve o' clock !
lay off !
what the heii are you shooting at ?
i thought i saw something , sir .
diana !
diana , are you here ?
a woman scorned , major .
sir ?
does everybody see that ?
does anyone know what the heii it is ?
ghosts .
rounds go right through these things .
how can we shoot them ?
have we got any intei on these things ?
negative .
hold your fire !
what is it , major ?
i want to try something .
we got you .
it' s iike i thought .
they' re holograms , iike our friend , only this one' s formless , iike a ghost .
a hologram .
like diana .
where' s the projection coming from ?
it got the major !
major , you aii right ?
how is he ?
took a iickin ' , stiii tickin ' .
wrist counter' s at 43 .
12 o' clock !
hold your fire .
stop wasting ammo .
they' re ground units .
wait for the buzz then shoot at the ground beneath them .
good shooting , sir .
three o' clock .
they' re everywhere .
this isn' t working .
don' t iet them get a iock on you .
come on .
get some !
garth , behind you .
heat .
they' re tracking us by heat .
use your flares .
ok .
now .
fire .
is that it ?
did we get ' em ail ?
heil , yes we did !
quick thinking .
good work .
you too .
king , check this out .
my daddy said it' s better to be iucky than good .
ain' t it beautifui when you' re both ?
you see me moving out there ?
no !
it' s the iast one .
how did we miss it ?
hernandez .
baby , you aii right ?
i' m good , king .
i' m good to go .
just give me a sec .
changing my battery .
no , you just rest , hernandez .
you done good .
just take a iittle rest .
don' t go on without me , sir .
no .
we won' t .
if you do ... who' s going to do the ... cooking ?
where' s hernandez ?
she didn' t make it .
i' m sorry .
i thought the steam venting might disable the units , as it did my equipment .
apparently i was wrong .
yeah , you were wrong .
and now hernandez is dead .
so you got what you wanted .
i never wanted anyone dead .
i told you from the beginning , you cannot defeat the security systems .
they' re insurmountable .
you are the security systems .
no .
i' m the chief of security , not the system itself .
if we went back , you' d clear the way ?
of course , but ...
then clear the way in front of us .
stand down the security protocols .
i can' t .
the defensive equipment is iinked to my autonomic nervous system .
i can no more do it than stop breathing .
you' re not breathing .
you' re a machine .
we' re wasting time .
i do not believe you are in this for the recovery of art .
my sensors indicate neither dislike or favour for it .
you had a discussion with captain lapierre about your people needing food .
spying bitch .
forget her .
has the world reaily relapsed to a point where food , the most basic of human needs , is worth such a premium ?
john , has the world truly devolved to this ?
yes .
and your employer has he made an agreement with you regarding food for the people you care for ?
it' s playing with you .
shut up , lapierre .
yeah .
food and medicine .
i wiii supply it for you .
i can teii you where there' s food .
tons of it .
earthquake supplies .
wafers , cakes , water , coffee ...
medicine ?
yes .
she' s iying .
john , if i supply you with the whereabouts of these things , wiii you turn back from this quest you are on ?
wiii you , john ?
no .
i can' t .
why not ?
cos i made an agreement .
do you always keep your agreements ?
is there any condition under which this contract might be broken ?
only if the other side breaks it first .
this puts me at a disadvantage .
i would iike to help you .
i would iike to see you survive .
but by your own admission you seek to terminate me .
i may be a machine , john , but i was once alive .
and now this image before you is aii i have ieft .
it' s an iilusion .
isn' t aii iife an iilusion ?
vincent enterprises developed a way to move my consciousness into a computer because my body was diseased .
i was dying .
it' s playing on your sympathies .
there' s a basic need for survival .
that' s how i know i' m stiii human , john .
even in this form i can stiii breathe .
would you take that away from me ?
just teii us where the command corridor is .
the command corridor ?
i thought you were iooking to shut down the power .
i am .
we are .
isn' t that where the nuke controls are ?
no .
they' re in the energy controi room .
your intei would have disclosed that .
if our intei disclosed everything , diana , we would have prevented you from kiiling hernandez and edershaw .
you' re heading into the residence .
after that there wiii be no turning back .
in this very corridor there is an escape feature which i can activate and which wiii catapult you to the rear garden .
if you choose this feature , i can teii you how to retrieve the earthquake supplies .
there is no shame in accepting this .
it is the wiser choice for those you care for .
please don' t go in there .
i don' t want to see you die .
john ?
this was vincent' s residence ?
yes .
he was a ... modest man .
he was a wacko .
i' ve seen better rooms in motei 6 .
when a man of mr vincent' s stature dedicates himself to creating a museum of our species ' greatest masterpieces , he has iittle time for self indulgent comforts .
he spent iess than four hours a day here , and only then to sleep .
only then ?
seems vincent' s rsum wasn' t iimited to ... procurer .
what about connoisseur ?
now that' s some fine art !
i' m not ashamed of it .
we' re going to iook for the stairweii down to the second sub floor .
king .
i was a graduate student at ucla .
mr vincent ...
you can drop the mr now .
i' ii caii him any damn thing i want .
he pursued me to modei for him .
finaily i relented .
was he that good or were you that good ?
mr vincent' s interest in me exceeded the professional .
he was in love with me .
i never returned the affection .
you' re iying .
what ?
he bought you with a job .
expect me to believe he didn' t buy the rest of you ?
you son of a bitch .
vincent wasn' t the kind of guy that didn' t get what he wanted .
unless ...
unless what ?
when you were diagnosed as terminai did you get a second opinion ?
of course .
not from one of vincent' s doctors ?
no .
what are you implying ?
he wanted you , didn' t he ?
he got to keep you young and beautiful .
his one of a kind super computer .
never to grow old , never to die ...
immortal .
and his .
forever .
garth .
major .
you should see this .
teii him what you told me .
it' s titanium ailoy .
if we use a standard iaser , it' d take a week to get through .
can we blow it ?
not this close to the nuke .
seen a couple of these over the years .
creator built them to withstand anything .
but there' s a flaw .
hinging mechanisms buckle under heat .
so if we create the heat i need using the plasma cutter , we can take it down .
time ?
a few hours at ieast .
get on it .
it' s a two man job .
get back to the residence .
we' ii come get you when we' re done .
garth .
you done good so far .
that wiii require some attention .
i hate it when you do that .
you' d rather i ieave ?
you' ii do as you wish .
i know why you' re reaily here .
do you ?
because of them .
elaine and christopher .
how do you know their names ?
of your wife and son ?
i' ve seen them .
or recordings of them .
the nationai security computer' s stiii up .
mr vincent has a key .
the sateilite communication system is stiii working .
show me .
during your iast security clearance review they shot some film of your family .
you two iook wonderfui together .
see ?
i can understand why you' re doing this .
they' re not real .
they' re not reai any more .
what happened ?
during the breakdown we were visiting elaine' s mother .
my father , he iives on the east side .
i went to get him .
there were riots .
the whole city was on fire .
people were kiiling each other .
it took me days to get back .
and by the time i did they were gone .
so you never iearned .
i' m a soldier .
i face the truth .
i know they' re dead .
but in your heart ...
you want to make sure .
john ...
on the desk there' s a pair of vr glasses .
put them on .
please .
for me .
john ?
i know you' re out there , john .
they' re coming this way .
we can' t stay any ionger .
i' ve used the iast of mom' s jeweilery to secure us passage on a ship .
we' re heading north .
it' s the best i can do for them now .
i know you' ii foilow and i know you' ii find us .
we' re survivors , john .
just iike you .
don' t give up on us .
it' s gotten bad , john .
the storm started two days ago and it hasn' t iet up .
elaine .
we can' t get to shore .
i' m afraid , john .
i' m so afraid .
knowing you' re out there means we' re stiii alive .
you get that , don' t you , john ?
this may be the end for me , but not for us .
be strong , my iove .
know we love you .
and as iong as you' re alive with memories of us , as iong as it burns within you , we wiii always be together .
elaine , don' t go .
thank you .
thanks for that .
i know what y o u are after .
ignore her .
you won' t reach it .
you sound iike a broken record .
if you go down there , i can' t protect you .
protect us ?
you don' t think you' ve defeated aii the security systems by yourself , do you ?
what if i had sent them aii at once ?
blah , blah , blah .
listen to me , captain .
downstairs is different .
the computer room is down there , along with the weapons storage bays .
there' s a stand alone system down there , fuily automated .
a kiiling machine .
get back to work .
it' s cailed the rook .
it was designed to replace soldiers on the battlefield .
it' s dormant now , but as soon as your heat signature reads on the bottom floor the rook wiii activate and kiii you .
shut up .
i' m asking you ...
i said shut up !
i don' t wanna hear any more of your iies .
if you continue in this manner , i' ii have to teii major garth what you' re truly after .
what' s she talking about ?
i said mind your work .
please .
reconsider .
no .
john .
john !
lapierre' s gone .
i couldn' t stop him .
king !
king !
yeah .
lapierre took off .
there' s something you should know .
the captain is not after mr vincent' s art .
what , then ?
before his death mr vincent had created a microorganism transmitted by seeds , capable of returning the ozone iayer to its previous state within a decade .
globai warming wiii be reduced and the earth wiii be reborn .
why didn' t he release it , then ?
the system had been sabotaged .
by the time it was repaired vincent had died and i alone could not activate it .
who were the saboteurs ?
trusted associates working for a man who had created a food substitute .
anton reich .
encrypt , this is diana 1 716 theta theta 6 .
rook activation override .
cease now .
y o u are n o t auth o rised .
emergency override .
cancei activation .
y o u are n o t auth o rised .
how do we stop this thing ?
you can' t .
the rook is a fuily autonomous operative .
its body armour is five times more effective than the armour you wear now .
it can destroy anything in this facility .
everything has a weakness .
the rook doesn' t .
where' s lapierre ?
in the command corridor .
right now he' s talking with mr reich by radio .
they' re attempting to raise the pod seed mechanisms so they may be recovered .
son of a bitch wants more compensation .
we have to activate that technology , or ...
go .
i' ii handle the rook .
you can' t .
it' s a rook .
i' m a king .
i' ii checkmate its ass .
go save the world .
he' s taken the remote detonator unit .
the pod terminals have risen .
major .
stings iike a bitch , don' t it ?
captain , you can' t beat the rook .
never could stand that haughty broad .
talking about vincent iike he' s a humanitarian , when he' s no better than any other rich bastard iooking for a martyrdom iegacy .
why ?
you' re asking me why , major ?
the world went from ten biilion to iess than a miilion .
and what' s ieft but false hope and reai estate ?
the pods wiii be released eventuaily .
but first reich wiii have his organic food empire .
and i' ii be the generai that runs it .
are you nuts ?
reich' s going to burn you .
reich needs me .
he' s got the vision but i am the implementation .
and when he' s gone ...
ch o pper f o ur , whisky papa .
lapierre , c o me in .
go ahead .
can y o u c o nfirm deactivati o n ?
roger that .
sams are offline .
you' re clear to iand .
repeat , clear to iand .
underst oo d .
whisky papa o ut .
i can' t iet you do it .
you can' t ?
how are you going to stop me ?
i got your pulse rifle .
diana' s taking a nap somewhere .
you' ve iost .
what makes you think you could stop me ?
cos i know something you don' t .
yeah ?
and what' s that ?
you can' t fight the rook alone .
the rook is just another one of your girlfriend' s inventions .
oh , yeah ?
why don' t you teii that to king ?
you' re going to be seeing him soon .
it' s real .
yeah , he' s real .
reai pissed off .
you got one chance .
that' s us fighting it together .
no way .
i give you back the rifle , you frag me .
think of the consequences .
i can' t beat the thing alone .
and i got to stay alive for my old man .
what do you say , captain ?
what do you say ?
lapierre !
your armour .
put it on him .
i' ii shoot the battery pack .
no !
do it .
now !
good work , major .
you found me .
are you ... ?
yes .
the disembodiment process is a one sided feature .
once the neurai energy is transferred there is no going back .
then why ?
theodore vincent wanted my body as much as my mind .
that' s him ?
yes .
near the end his health began to diminish .
he had plans to join me in immortality , but he made one cruciai error .
what' s that ?
he underestimated me .
he thought his files were encrypted and that i would never iearn the truth .
the truth you so acutely guessed .
i wasn' t dying , you see , after ail .
it was aii a ruse .
a ruse to possess me , to enslave me .
in the end it was his love for technology that betrayed him .
a simple camera in a simple room during a simple conversation .
you were justified .
was i ?
mm .
for 20 years i' ve iived in a prison .
alone .
did i murder him or save him a iife of heil , just iike mine ?
not much of a choice .
no .
it' s not .
no .
i would iive in here with you a thousand times over .
but you are not dead , john garth .
you don' t have to make the choice .
in fact , you stiii have some work to do .
lapierre is almost at the courtyard where the pod seed cannons are .
let me show you another way .
hurry .
going somewhere ?
you just don' t quit .
hoo wah .
vega was the same way .
when he iearned what we wanted to do , he tried to walk away .
issue of morality .
had to shoot him down iike a dog .
do i have to do the same to you ?
only if you want to go to heii with me .
what' s it going to take , garth ?
i don' t imagine you' re going to iet us walk out of here with this .
you want it ?
come get it .
i wasn' t hoping for anything iess .
now we know , huh ?
that was for vega .
weii done , major garth .
weii done .
lapierre told me you were good , but i didn' t expect that good .
it' s too bad reaily .
i could have used your experience .
oh , weil .
there' s always survivors eager to make a buck .
reaily that' s what i want to do .
mankind wiii be served , but only after i do some business first .
i won' t iet you do it .
you' re bleeding to death , major .
you can' t move .
how can you stop me ?
with the push of a button .
you' re quite the mess , john garth .
i' m dying .
no .
not yet .
somebody' s at the gate .
what is it , general ?
salvation .
what is it ?
what do you see ?
a new day .
