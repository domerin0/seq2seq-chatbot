when humans are born , their innate nature is good .
those who are alike in nature , have different habits .
lf you don' t educate your children , they will be led astray ...
ah sang , what are you doing ?
this is called " hanging from a beam , stabbed on the bottom " .
this superior awl was granted to me by uncle .
lf you don' t study hard , i' il stab your bottom with it !
lf you continue to stab me , i' il tell father that you sneaked out to steal bird' s eggs .
and that you almost fell into a sewer .
you' il be spanked hard then .
cousin , please don' t tell uncle .
what if i let you stab me once instead ?
why is it so noisy outside ?
uncle' s performing a lion dance in the grand salon .
a lot of people are there too .
who' s out there ?
the leaders of the shaolin , wutang ,
baak hok and wing chun schools of martial arts .
a very enthusiastic crowd indeed .
i see .
they' re here again to challenge father to a fight .
that doesn' t seem to be the case .
i heard that uncle had invited them over to watch him wash his hands .
wash his hands ? !
yes .
lf they' re all here to watch him wash his hands , how will he eat and go to the toilet ?
let' s go see what' s happening !
okay .
bravo !
bravo !
good stuff !
good stuff !
bravo !
bravo !
it' s reaily good !
not this , not that , not concealed , not knowing ...
mother .
mother , please don' t block the view .
you' ve got some cheek .
coming out here , instead of studying hard in the study !
lf your father found out , he' d spank you !
mother , my queue has straightened out from studying day and night .
your father is doing all this for you !
can it be that my father is washing his hands this time for my sake too ?
of course .
wisen up !
lf your father sees you , you' il be whipped again , you know ?
yes !
bravo !
bravo !
dear fellow martial arts practitioners .
i invited you here today to use this occasion to wash my hands in a golden basin .
and to announce my retirement from our martial arts world .
brother yeung , your tai chi lmmortal fist fighting style made you famous .
you' re respected and admired as one who upholds justice .
why retire ?
ever since the allied troops from eight countries invaded china , there' s been civil unrest and no peace .
i just wish to live in seclusion and educate my son .
i see ...
father washed his hands so he could teach me the tai chi lmmortal fist fighting style .
that' s what you think !
i' ve been friends with you heroes for decades .
obviously , some approach me with benevolence , some come with hatred .
i' m hoping that after washing my hands in the golden basin ,
i' il be a stranger to the martial arts world .
a smile to eliminate all hatred .
who are you ?
sir , forgive my ignorance .
would you please tell us your name ?
my surname is wong , but i go by my leg fighting style .
no one could defeat me in the north .
i came today to try out your tai chi lmmortal fist fighting style .
i am determined to retire from the martial arts world .
sir , if you want to compete , just let me say that i have been defeated by you .
father , by saying that , you' re being too cowardly !
fight with him !
i have heard that the yeung family style of tai chi is so soft that you seem boneless , but it seems that you' re not only boneless , but a coward as well .
okay . lf you won' t fight , i' il kick you until you fight .
i read in martial arts novels that the great fighters only fight with their mouths .
that' s what it means to reach the highest level .
how about changing it from a martial arts contest to a literary contest ?
literary contest ?
how ?
very simple .
you' re only allowed to say the moves ' names , and explain your line of attack and defence .
that will determine the outcome .
that' s means it' s a kissing fight .
old guy , can you do it ?
you are our guest .
please start .
good .
my move is " black tiger stealing heart .
my move is " moving obstructing punch .
right fist rotating to strike your wrist .
i withdraw my right fist and use " shaolin iron sand palm .
i use " moving obstructing punch " again .
i withdraw both hands , and use " consecutive fists .
i still use " moving obstructing punch .
moving obstructing punch ? !
you keep using " moving obstructing punch ! " don' t you have any other moves ?
lf he keeps on using " moving obstructing punch , " he may lose .
what do you know ?
watch and learn .
okay .
i' il allow you to see my kicks .
consecutive sweeps , front sweep , back sweep , left sweep , right sweep .
father .
you can use " buddha warrior' s backward punch .
backward throw , combined with attack .
okay .
i continue to sweep with my feet .
sweep ... sweep ...
sweep !
stop !
why did you say " stop ?
you lost .
which move was the losing move ?
you' re a woman , what do you know ? !
i' ve been his wife for many years .
of course i know which move is his best !
madame yeung , you are indeed very knowledgeable .
sir ...
when he used his " left and right rising kicks " , you' d have been on the ground before you could make a move .
get lost !
as you wish ...
i have no interest in fighting with words .
let' s fight it out properly .
lnclining wind stance " .
white monkey presenting fruit " .
good !
good kicks !
you are the northern king of kicks !
i concede failure .
you' re still pretending !
today , either you break an arm or i' il break a leg .
we must decide on a winner .
you and i are members of the martial arts .
why go to such extremes ?
i won' t just go to extremes , but will kick you all over !
father !
be careful !
wild horse parts mane " .
consecutive brooms of iron !
hands as a cross " .
lron punch " .
i' m sorry .
i used too much strength .
okay .
yeung , i concede .
i will never stop until i defeat you .
predestiny as life , life as tao .
practice of tao : those who follow the way of tao may not stray .
you may stray , but the way will be untrue .
bloodthirsty by nature , nature as tao .

it' s a father' s fault if one doesn' t teach one' s son .
okay , okay ...
you wash your hands of the world , and move to hanzhou to live in seclusion .
you lock your son and your nephew in the study like they were in jail .
even if you don' t feel for them , it hurts me .
everything has a beginning and an end .
read , quickly !
i' il prick your bottom !
ouch !
mother !
the road to further learning ...
stop playacting !
your mother can' t help you !
it hurts me too .
but it' s one thing to hurt , and another to be a soft touch .
lf a monkey slips its leash , you' il never catch it again !
you' re too fearful .
you shouldn' t have asked me to bear a son .

dragon king worship .
they pray for ample rain and plentiful harvest .

they' re just following the will of the heavens .
i shouldn' t have spoiled you !
look at these people .

calling out for your mother is useless !
look !
what a mess you' ve made of this lion' s head !
ls it a water lion or a mud lion ?
really !
you' ve made a mess of your father' s family treasure !
quickly apologise and then go back to the study and study hard !
i' m not the person who' s at fault !
huh ?
i' m not at fault either !
lf it isn' t you , then whose fault is it ?
mine ?
it' s you .
you treated me like a prisoner for more than 1 years .
lsn' t it a bit much ?
what ?
i' m overdoing it ?
for whom did i wash my hands of and retire from the martial arts world ?
for whose sake did i leave my hometown , and hide my name ?
okay ...
as you' re getting beaten to death outside anyway , let me do it instead !
i' il beat you to death !
i' m not wrong !
have you gone mad ?
did you have to hit your son' s face ?
do you want to disfigure his face ?
do you want him to be unable to get a wife ?
it' s a fight to death !
to death !
have you gone mad ?
your father' s bark has always been worse than his bite .
don' t hold it against him .
mother .
i understand him .
but i don' t like him locking me in the study , facing four walls and a pile of books !
i don' t know anything about the outside world !
son , who was that girl who used a western umbrella to shelter you ?
her name is rat .
rat ?
it' s " rose " , isn' t it ?
yes . ls it a foreign name ?
ln chinese , it means " rose .
rose ?
it sounds beautiful .
she' s chinese .
why does she have a foreign name ?
those who study abroad have english names .
i had one too .
diana .
dai what na ?
it' s di a na .
it sounds good .
why not pick one for me ?
how about jacky ?
jacky ?
what does it mean ?
not much , but ...
when i was in america , in the wild west ,
i really looked up to a hero .
he was called jacky .
rat said i was a hero too .
okay , i' il be jacky .
she called you a hero ?
son , you' ve got hope !
rose is both smart and pretty .
listen to me . lf she' s a rat , then you' re the cat to catch a rat !
how ?
remember ...
to woo this kind of westernised girl ....
mother said i should be a rat catching cat , so i' il wait for the rat .
once she comes out , i' il catch her .
west lake is so big .
lf you don' t ask her where she lives , how are you going to catch a rat ?
west lake is so beautiful .
even the rats are more beautiful .
rat' s appeared !
she' s throwing me a love letter .
we must promote democracy and use science to save our country .
what does she mean ?
i don' t know .
rat !
wait for me !
hey !
rat !
hey !
i' m here !
hok man .
i' ve had a lot of trouble finding you .
really ?
how did you know i was here ?
our hearts are secretly connected .
rat , i also have an english name .
from now on , call me jacky .
jacky ?
i' il call you " jacky " then .
then we have even more in common .
why do you only know how to say " yes " ?
you say " yes , " so i say " yes .
then you can help us distribute the leaflets .
don' t say " yes ! " let' s go home to study .
i still need to catch a rat .
you go home first and hold the fort .
jacky !
we' re selling democracy to save the country !
who wants democracy ?
who wants science ?
it' s free .
get it if it suits you .
it' s free .
it' s a leaflet .
what' s a leaflet ?
a leaflet states what we write , which in turn informs you .
i' m illiterate .
how can i read it ?
i' il read it out loud .
" let' s save this country with democracy .
he' s right .
you want rice to cook with , i want your poo to fertilise my fields .
okay .
we' il give you poo , but you need to use scientific methods .
yes , yes .
don' t go !
stand still !
not good !
let' s go !
lf they catch us , we' il lose our heads !
everyone will lose their heads ?
stop jabbering .
let' s go !
you want to chop everyone down ?
come on !
rose !
rose !
it' s the qing soldiers !
let' s scram !
where' s jacky ?
we ran away .
he didn' t .
he' il probably be arrested .
how could you leave him behind ?
move !
don' t run !
chase him down !
chase him !
chase him down !
stand stiil !
stay there !
watch where you' re going !
watch out !
let him get down !
my manure is all gone !
hey !

i' m alright .
don' t run away !
let' s go !

rat , scram !
i' il deal with this !
let me deal with this person , okay ?
yeung wan .
hey !
why are you here ?
to catch the rebels .
who is this ?
he looks familiar .
he' s a friend of mine .
you don' t have to speak in a foreign tongue .
do you know who i am ?
who are you ?
her fiance .
fiance ?
i' m warning you now .
i don' t want to ever see you again with my fiance !
ah wing !
i have the freedom to make my own friends !
jacky ! lgnore him .
let' s go !
sir , the foreign girl was handing out leaflets everywhere .
she must be a rebel .
rebel ? !
she' s mandarin tsao' s daughter .
we' ve hung out since we were children .
our parents arranged our marriage before our birth .
arranged marriage ?
yes .
aren' t you against feudal concepts of marriage ?
yes .
but if we shared the same interests , i would marry him .
what if you don' t get along ?
then ...
say ' no ' then .
" say ' no ' ?
this is where i teach and where the children congregate .
teacher , goodbye .
goodbye .
england is so small , but china is so big .
the moment the english devils take on a fighting stance , the qing government gets scared into giving hong kong to england .
lf this continues ...
shenzhen , guangzhou , even hanzhou will become part of the british empire .
yes .
you are correct .
why are you here ?
i brought him here .
this is where we discuss matters of state .
how can you casually introduce strangers into this ?
i trust him .
i want him to join our democratic save the country party .
i really want to join .
you want to join ?
cut off the tail from your head first .
cut off my queue ?
why ?
each nation has its rules , each profession theirs .
that' s one of our rules of joining .
you haven' t cut yours ?
us ?
this humiliation ? !
we' ve all cut it off .
cut !
i can' t cut it off .
you' re afraid of losing your head !
of course i' m afraid of losing my head , but i' m even more afraid of my father .
what in the world ... ? !
we aren' t afraid of losing our heads or our blood .
we aren' t even afraid of the emperor or the dowager empress .
and you' re still afraid of your father !
cut or not ?
no .
actually , cutting your queue is a gesture to show you want to save the country .
a famous man once said ,
only by rallying the people , driving away the foreigners , can one save china .
correct .
the theory is great .
ass kisser !
what do you know ?
i don' t know anything .
what ?
confucius says ,
those who play , do not understand ...
once you let go , he doesn' t come back !
what' s up ?
you' ve finished seeing over one hundred patients already ?
hok man !
huh ?
do you actually understand or not ?
understand .
not knowing is not knowing , knowing is knowing .
not knowing is not knowing , knowing is knowing ...
read clearer !
can you hear me ?
your reading is a mess !
i just saw hok man .
he was studying until dawn .
he' s got a cold .
a cold ?
yes .
it could turn into a lung disease .
hey !
you' d better not disturb him .
go cook medicine for him .
okay .
i' il go cook the medicine .
go , go .
... not knowing ...
stop reciting .
where is he ?
i don' t know .
mother .
just back now ?
you almost got me into trouble .
hey !
you' ve been gone most of the day .
did you catch the rat ?
not even close .
mother , what does " say no " mean ?
it' s means " to refuse someone " .
what ?
did rose say no to you ?
no .
mother .
teach me english .
why ?
why do you want to learn english all of a sudden ?
rat' s classmates sometimes speak in english and i don' t understand .
now i finally understand that the world outside is so large .
what i want to learn is much more than i am able to learn .
lndeed .
learning has no boundaries .
you want to learn chinese and english .
leave it up to your mother .
repeat after me .
auntie sold horses growing up ?
mother , am i getting it almost right ?
not almost , but completely wrong !
good son , did i scare you ?
you' re even scarier than father .
lf you want to catch rat quicker , i have to be stern .
son , got it ?
mother , i know what you think .
don' t teach me " pyjamas buy big horse .
then what do you want to learn ?
first teach me to say ' i love you . '
good boy .
no wonder mother loves you so .
i love you is ...
mother .
did i get it right ?
no ... yes .
i hope that when he gets a wife , he won' t forget his mother !

jacky !
are you okay ?
i' m okay .
what' s happening ?
you' ve exposed the foreign devils ' tricks .
you' ve done a great service .
mandarin tsao .
i heard that some people were attempting robbery at the pier , and so i came to secure the scene .
sir , please leave .
as a customs official , if someone' s smuggling opium ...
i can' t step aside .
i don' t think you could handle this !
my boss' s backer is the british empire' s east lndia company .
can you afford to deal with them ?
colleague , those who know when to do their duty is truly admirable .
why don' t you pretend you didn' t see this ?
go back and smoke some opium .
let me deal with this here .
a crowd is watching , it will be difficult to avoid gossip .
move the tea leaves to the godown .
what do you want to do ?
let' s just burn aii the opium !
yes !
yes !
burn it all !
good !
burn it all !
good !
daddy , you' re doing good !
let' s go then !
okay .
the opium was confiscated by customs using your very own hands !
you have to get it back for me .
or else , don' t blame me for not saving your face .
mr. smith , you should blame your two subordinates .
they started a fight at the pier .
started a fight ?
those people were asking people to quit smoking opium .
they' re setting themselves against me .
you should have arrested them .
how dare you threaten a qing government official .
i' m arresting you !
you arrest me ?
even your dowager empress has to be polite to us english .
you' re just a mandarin !
what do you think you are ?
i' m telling you this is chinese land .
it' s not for you to act like a bandit , and disregard us !
you' re coming back with me to court .
mr. smith .
i will deal with it .
i' m leaving .
brother wing , let' s go .
brother wing , let' s go !
what ?
what ?
what are you doing ?
teacher above , please accept a bow from your students .
how can i be your teacher ?
i haven' t studied abroad nor cut my queue .
lucky you didn' t cut your queue .
i hope that you' il teach us your " queue move " .
then we won' t have to whistle at night , and don' t have to scramble away when handing out leaflets .
but your queue is fake .
i don' t think that you could do the " queue moves " .
huh ?
not succeed ?
it' s all your fault .
why is it my fault ?
i didn' t know .
brother magical queue , can this work ?
can you teach us ?
okay .
lf you want to learn the " queue moves " , you can' t be like a frog , do two leaps , and stop for three .
then what shall we do ?
it' s only after hanging from the beam daily for more than ten years , and by studying hard , did i succeed .
i want to hang from the beam , too .
teacher , i want to hang , too .
teach us .
okay .
let' s all hang from the beam .
the three word sutra , that existed in the past , " establish the new .
at this time , learn knowledge , listen to science .
whoever doesn' t study hard won' t be able to do the " queue moves . " .. separate truth and falsehood , be unafraid of suffering .
be unafraid of tears , eventually , you' il see results ...
i didn' t realise that you were good at coaxing kids .
did you really learn the " queue moves " that way ?
really .
i really have to thank my father .
ever since i was young , he would hold a whip and hang me from a beam .
that' s how i became who i am today .
do you get along with your father ?
not at all .
we don' t agree on anything , but he' s sacrificed so much for me , i' m really grateful .
my daddy loves me a lot , but there' s a generation gap .
i hate it when he smokes opium , but he can' t quit .
my father is the best at helping people quit smoking opium .
then do you know how ?
it' s obvious .
not difficult .
daddy !
jacky' s here to see you .
uncle tsao .
yeung wan , you' ve got a good eye .
daddy , what are you talking about ?
i brought jacky here to cure you .
cure me ?
i' m not sick !
see !
i' m so healthy !
it' s this disease .
give it to me .
this is a sickness ?
smoking opium makes one happier than an immortal .
these pleasures , you won' t understand .
jacky , why don' t i raise you to the immortal plane ?
lf you inhale a few times , you' il feel like you' re afloat , and won' t be able to stop .
eh ?
no , thank you .
i go east , you follow to the east , i go west , you follow to the west .
bring it there ... come over here .
here , here , here ... come over here , come over there .
hey , jacky !
be careful you don' t hurt my father !
no problem .
what kind of kung fu is it ?
my arm is stuck to yours , i can' t get loose .
this is tai chi' s sticky strength , " sticky fist move .
once you let me stick to you , you won' t be able to get loose .
see ?
i can' t believe this .
you' re so young , but your kung fu is so good already .
hold on tight , uncle .
uncle tsao , forgive me .
bravo .
lf you learn these moves , you' il enjoy countless pleasures and live a long life .
now , first relax .
close your eyes .
okay .
close my eyes .
relax some more .
close your eyes .
i' m very relaxed already .
correct .
hey !
what are you doing ?
what kind of move is this ?
this is jacky' s family' s unique quit smoking opium move .
you got together with him to get me to quit smoking opium ?
yes .
i don' t want to quit .
uncle tsao , rose is only doing what' s good for you .
opium' s dangerous .
once addicted , you' re not as happy as an immortal , but instead you' il die faster .
yes indeed .
daddy , do you know that the english ban smoking opium in their own land , but ship it to china .
as a parent , you should set a good example , you hear ?
do you hear me ?
i understand this truth .
ever since your mother died ,
i only have this and you as my treasures .
you' re often not by my side .
without this , how can i pass my days ?
how' s this !
it' s either this or me .
choose me , then you definitely won' t have this .
lf you insist on choosing this , then i' m going back to america .
stand still !
where are you going ?
i' m going to america and not coming back .
get back here !
of course i' il choose you !
i' ve tried to quit so many times for this precious daughter already .
by tying me up like this , are you sure i can quit completely ?
yes .
rest assured , uncle .
it works every time .
then how long do i have to be tied up ?
it depends on the depth of your addiction .
lf mild , three to five days .
lf serious , three to five years .
three to five years ?
daddy , do you want to back out again ?
no , no , no ...
i was just thinking that if this worked , then i should get jacky to help all my subordinates along with me .
okay ?
okay !
why don' t you let jacky reform your troops ?
okay , okay .
jacky , lets ' go .
store your strength like a bow .
use your strength like shooting an arrow .
i' m tired ...
what in the world ? !
how can you protect the country like this ?
miss , you' re just watching .
of course , it' s easy for you .
it' s obvious you' re exhibiting signs of opium addiction , and you' re arguing with me ? !
look at you !
you' re too weak to even hold an opium pipe .
when our superior officer comes to practise with us , he smokes too .
miss , if you let us smoke , you' il see ... a radical change .
shut up !
jacky , teach them a lesson .
listen up .
your superior officer invited me to cure you .
lf you' re smart , you' il throw away your pipe yourself , or you can follow the example set by your superior officer .
wake up !
which do you choose ?
yeung wan .
why are you here ?
why is he here ?
daddy invited him .
rebel !
use strength .
last time , because of yeung wan , i let you go .
but you still have the guts to make an exhibit of yourself and deceive me ?
mr. lam .
i too have studied the classics .
i' m educated too .
i don' t aspire to make an exhibit of myself and deceive .
please forgive me .
what are you doing ?
i just wanted to test him .
good for you !
let' s take a walk over there .
okay .
jacky , continue practising .
what are you looking at !
continue practising !
what can i do for you ?
don' t you remember what i told you ?
what ?
it' s my birthday in a few days .
really ?
i hope that you' il be able to attend my dance party .
okay .
i will definitely come .
yeung wan .
huh ?
let' s go and sit down .
you' re always hanging out with the fake foreign devils trying to organise ... " democracy and science will save our country ?
it' s useless .
you' il get your head chopped off .
i know ... but if what we think is so different , what' s the meaning in that ?
no meaning !!
you' re saying that it' s meaningless to be with me , but it' s meaningful to be with that kid , right ? !
what are you talking about ?
you know , you' ve completely changed .
you' ve buried your conscience .
with your elder brother , you' re helping the foreigners smuggle opium .
don' t compare me with my brother !
his selling opium , that' s none of my business !
i only know that i should rise through the ranks and increase my wealth , so that you can live in luxury , and make my ancestors proud .
everything i do , is for you !
please don' t continue !
lf you continue , then i won' t want to attend your party anymore .
i understand .
why don' t you calm down first ... but i really hope to see you at the party ... in a better mood .
rose , what' s wrong ?
nothing .
did my presence cause you two to fight ?
no ...
do you know how to dance ?
i know the " plucking tea leaves " folk dance .
not some tea dance , but " tango " .
tango " ?
i' ve never heard of it .
why don' t you show me ?
okay .
i' m home !
you' re early !
pan frying fish , mother ?
look at you !
you look so happy !
did you catch the rat ?
rat brought me to her home .
she even invited me to a dance party and asked me to partner her .
then you' re almost there !
quickly let your mother hold her grandchild .
mother , stop thinking so far ahead .
rat asked me to dance the " tango " .
but i don' t know such things .
what shall i do ?
you have me !
this is an opportunity for your mother to show off .
son , did you watch carefully just now ?
mother , please teach me .
okay , i' il teach you .
come ...
follow my lead .
did i step on you ?
no matter .
let' s do it again .
come ... just spin around , around and around and then catch my hands .
mother !
let' s not dance .
why ?
you' re going to hurt yourself .
no worries .
how' s this ? lf i fall again , i won' t call out , okay ?
come , again !
turn ... hold my hands ... correct , that was right ... come on ...
that' s it ...
mother , i' m sorry .
did i crash into you ?
can' t you use less strength ?
what' s the point of always calling on your precious ?
you deserve this !
you only know how to be pessimistic .
pessimistic ?
your son ? ls he ever as good to you as i am ? !
really !
you' re right .
you' re the one who' s caring .
do continue rubbing , it' s so comfortable .
you can be comfortable ...
there' s something i don' t want to keep from you .
your son had a big fight with a foreigner' s bodyguards today .
fighting ?
what if he got his arms and legs broken , then what ?
sorry !
don' t worry . lf he' d broken his limbs , how would he have gotten home ?
on top of that , he was really clever .
not only did he defeat all the foreigner' s bodyguards by himself , but he exposed the foreigners ' opium smuggling operations , and became a hero in hangzhou .
what ?
he fought with a foreigner' s bodyguards and returned unscathed ?
by what means ?
who' s that ?
who are you ?
you little twerp , don' t you recognise me ?
i see .
northern king of kicks .
one of my father' s defeated foes .
you don' t like to face people or what ?

come down , come down .
okay .
i don' t want to come down now .
what can you do ?
come up instead !
what are you looking at !
can' t hit my son !
why didn' t you hit me ?

you want to go about the martial arts world with such poor kung fu ?

a toothache isn' t like this .
it seems like a skin disease .
you women don' t know anything .
that type of skin condition only occurs on the midriff , not the face .
lf i say it' s a toothache , it' s a toothache .
okay ...
lf you say it' s a toothache , then it is .
i' il go get you the toothache medicine .

kindness is wasted on you .
good morning , mother .

mother , don' t worry .
father can deal with a little aggravation .
lf we leave , he' il get up immediately .

mr. wong , welcome , welcome .
mandarin tsao .

i haven' t worn it in more than 2 years .
i just took it out yesterday .
how embarrassing .
auntie , don' t be so humble .
it' s back in fashion in america again .
you say the nicest things .
then i' il be retro then .
mr. yeung , sir .
i was wondering what your thoughts were on a marriage between jacky and rose ?

rose and jacky ?
what has their marriage to do with us ?
huh ?
father , i' m jacky .
huh ?
you' re jacky ?
rose , you' re going to america for your honeymoon ?
i want to go with jacky' s father too !
yes , yes !
cool !
my precious daughter has a kind heart , and she at least has aspirations .
but she' s got a bit of a temper ...
daddy ...
see ... ?
but your jacky' s different .
he' s learned , cultured , a scholar and a fighter .
he must have been brought up well .
you' re too kind , too kind ...
uncle tsao ...
it' s all due to my father .
yes , yes ...
yes , yes ...
oh ... no , no ...
mr. tsao , you' re kind with your praise .
you' re too modest , too modest .
daddy , you only know part of the story .
it' s actually auntie who deserves the most praise .
don' t be silly ... it' s all due to my husband ...
too kind , too kind ...
mr. tsao , i admire your tenacity on being able to quit opium smoking .

did you say they committed murder ?
we haven' t killed anyone .
mandarin lam , don' t frame us !
me , framing you ? !
brother wing was your fiance , but with your lover , you committed the poisonous act !
huh ?
ln recompense for the murder of my brother , you have to pay in blood .
you' re coming with me , or do i have to take action ?
father , mother , don' t worry .
the truth will come out .
take care ...
stop !
come back !
mandarin lam , my son is very disobedient , but i trust him .

smart boy !
i' il let you be number one in the world then .
what kind of kung fu are you using ?
these " queue moves " are especially made to whip villainous types like you !
each whip of the queue has power , huh ?
the queue can even come from under my arm !
the queue can come from under the crotch of my trousers !
let' s see if you can fly !

you nasty buffoon !
careful , you might fall to your death !
i' m going to fight to the death with you today !

or i' il beat you up so much that your mother won' t even recognise you !
come on !
i' il flatten your nose !
you want to play on the ropes with me !
you don' t know the meaning of death !
i' il flatten your monkey' s head with my feet !
are you more alert now ?
one stick of incense in the morning " .
you didn' t die from the fall .
thousand weights coming sideways " .
jacky , are you okay ?
i' m okay .
then is he dead ?
even if he isn' t , then he' s badly hurt .
move aside !
are you all right ?
i' m all right .
it' s a secret western weapon .
it' s a pistol !
it might misfire .
move aside !
i told you that even if you were hard , i' d beat you till you were soft .
don' t move all of you !
your younger brother' s murderer is over there !
