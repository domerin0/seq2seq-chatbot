i miss you .
testing .
testing .
hey , brit .
hey .
how you doing ?
i' m okay .
don' t worry , sweetie .
it' il be okay .
your mom will always be with you .
seniors .
quiet down .
seniors !
this party atmosphere quite simply has to stop .
move .
god , bitch !
no wonder they held her back twice .
maya , i heard principal mosster' s making you work the school paper .
yeah , that or juvie .
now , i' m joined today by detective morrison and coroner haynes .
they' re here to enlighten you on the dangers of excess .
now , listen up .
detective .
i can promise you all one thing .
that this will be short ?
that if you party too hard for the rest of this school year ... ... we' re the people you' re gonna meet .
i' ve seen it too many times to even count .
a kid gets a hold of some alcohol , maybe some drugs ... ... and you don' t know when enough is enough .
call goes out ... ... and that' s where the coroner , dr. haynes , comes in .
that' s where i come in .
and a few days later ... ... a badly decomposed corpse washes up on the beach .
it becomes my job to identify the body .
and do you know how i do that ?
dental records .
kiss ass .
yeah .
it' s a sad and sorry task , but yes , that' s how it' s done .
and if there' s no dental records ?
well , then we would have to carry out a dna analysis ...
... of the corpse' s bone marrow .
that' s fucked up .
it' s not that difficult of a process .
you take the bone marrow and grind it up in these little pieces ... ... and then you add in some dye elements and some chemicals ... ... and you put that all in an agarose gel .
get it up !
then you take your gel and put that ....
my apologies , detective .
it' s so hard to keep their attention , especially today .
why , what' s today ?
the district volleyball final .
they love their volleyball here at blue bay .
can' t think why .
blue bay sucks !
here' s a new angle on the brittney havers story .
forget that whole preppy , popular girl bullshit .
let' s go deeper .
let' s expose how little miss trailer park ... ... became the richest bitch at blue bay high .
get it up !
get it up !
let' s go !
come on !
yeah !
good shot .

that' s her dead mother' s portrait , you dumb ass .
i' m sorry , brit .
they' re just assholes .
i messed up bad this time .
why don' t you marry a millionaire , just like your dear , dead mother ?
what the hell are you doing here ?
thought i' d write a story for the school rag .
gator white trash makes good .
what you think ?
don' t you dare , you bitch .
so ... ... tell me what your poor , desperate , alcoholic mother ... ... ever saw in booty chasing millionaire niles dunlap .
why don' t you get the fuck out of here ?
you may fool your cardboard cutout friends ... ... but i still remember where you came from .
you can take the girl out of the trailer park ... ... but you can' t take the trailer park out of the girl .
out of my fucking house before i call the police !
trouble in paradise ?
i' m not gonna say it again !
out of my fucking house before i call the police !

bald head , tall , glasses .

what did i tell you ?

that' s enough .
look .
look at me .
oh , my god !
l' il blow your fucking head off !
next time i' m here , your whole family
niles ?
what happened ?
nothing .
who was that guy ?
it' s none of your business , okay ?
i' m leaving tomorrow , and you pull this party shit ?
how am i supposed to trust you now ?
i' m sorry , okay ?
you can trust me , dad .
stepdad .

there was just this guy at the house last night .
what happened ?
no , nothing like that .
what , then ?
just forget about it .
tell me about the guy , brit .
was it one of those cute frat guys ?
no .
come on .
tell me .
there was a man threatening niles with a gun .
seriously ?
jesus .
when i asked niles about it ... ... all he did was give me shit about the party .
i' m sorry .
what are you gonna do ?
i don' t want to talk about this right now .
let' s go to practice .
hey , brit .
brit .
principal' s looking for you .
call you back .
brittney .
what is it ?
maybe you' d better sit down .
last time you asked me to do that , my mother was dead .
there' s been an accident .
no .
no , not again .
afternoon , detective .
lnsurance investigator .
great .
any word on what caused the crash , if you don' t mind me asking ?
you know what ?
i do mind .
we' re on the same team .
we' re both looking for answers .
no , we' re not .
i' m looking to wrap this up and go home .
you' re looking to find trouble .
i' m just trying to do my job .
oh , yeah ?
what' s your job ?
scratch a wound till it bleeds ?
what happened here is the guy took on gravity and he lost .
that simple enough for you ?
nothing is ever as simple as it appears .
hey , look around you , pal .
this is a police investigation .
you don' t belong here .
so pay that girl her check and go back to wherever you came from .
detective .
what do you got ?
looks like swamp rats .
they probably went in after the body .
excuse me .
you ever hear of a rat running into a burning airplane ?
i' m sorry to be bothering you .
i know this isn' t an easy time for you .
something wrong ?
we ....
we found rats in the fuselage of niles ' airplane .
they' d chewed through the wiring .
are you serious ?
like somebody put them there on purpose .
you know anybody who may have been angry ... ... or had a grudge against your stepfather ?
hey , brit .
what about that guy you told me about ?
the one that threatened niles .
wanna tell me something ?
what did i tell you ?
you think you' re a gambler ?
a hundred .
two hundred .
that' s enough .
look at me .
i' m gonna fucking
i' m gonna have to take that tape .
according to mr. dunlap' s will , miss havers shall be furnished a stipend ... ... until she graduates from a college of her choice .
after that , she' il be provided with a small trust .
how small are we talking ? $25, 000 a year for life . $25, 000 a year ?
what about controlling interest in the company ?
his 51 percent will revert to the corporate trust ... ... of which the board will supervise , subject to the provisions of the will .
there must be some kind of mistake .
i' m afraid not , miss havers .
what were the provisions ?
that the money would go to a blood heir , if mr. dunlap had one .
otherwise , the trust is to donate the money ... ... to mr. dunlap' s favourite country club .
this is bullshit .
what ?
these are your stepfather' s last wishes .
ls there any other money ?
mr. dunlap took out a $2 million life insurance policy last year .
but with no heir , i' m afraid that also reverts to the trust .
so $25, 000 a year .
that' s it ?
a lot of people live very well on $25, 000 a year .
ln the glades , maybe .
we' il have the papers ready for you to sign in front of the judge tomorrow .
term national .
lt' s me .
well , how' s life in blue bay with the rich and shameless ?
same shit , different day .
listen , lacey , i need you to do me a favour .
give me everything you can on niles dunlap .
hire a pl .
l want the good , the bad , the ugly .
where are you going with all this , t. ?
i smell a rat .
what up , boss ?
thought you fulfilled your weekly hours .
got another angle on the brittney havers story .
this shit ain' t gonna sell .
you need to think sensational .
that' s what i' m talking about .
that' s kind of disrespectful to brittney .
what the hell do i care ?
fuck her if she can' t take a joke .
but with the will , i' m sure she doesn' t need any more bad news .
what about the will ?
i heard she lost out on everything except 25 grand a year .
all his money' s going to the country club ... ... unless they can find a blood relative .
damn .
that fucker must have been worth a boat load .
sixty five mil , according to forbes .
honey , you need to get out more .
perfect .
let' s see what we got here .
i' m afraid there' s not much we can do for the little fella .
i didn' t think so , doctor .
what i need here is some information .
what kind of information ?
where did this thing come from ?
why was it found in the control panel of a downed airplane ?
you really loved this rat , didn' t you ?
lndeed .
this could be worth 2 million .
okay , i' il run some tests .
i really appreciate this .
thanks .
sure , buddy .
yeah , you rat .
crime figures are down for one reason only .
hard work and dedication of men and women of this department .
excuse me .
i' m in the middle of this dog and pony show .
we got it .
what ?
the guy from the security tape .
fax came from miami p. d.
small time hood runs backroom gambling joints for the cuban mafia .
i' il call you back .
there she is !
everything' s fine , brittney .
come on .
what' s going on ?
there' s a wrinkle in dunlap' s will .
what do you mean ?
the clause about a blood relative getting the money .
come on , make some room .
back off .
she doesn' t have a comment .
no , she is lying !
order !
i will not tolerate another outburst in my courtroom .
i understand that this is hard for you , but you will respect this process .
now , miss king , will you please continue .
like i said , niles dunlap was my father .
you lying little bitch !
order in the court !
order !
order !
order !
court' s adjourned .
we' il try again tomorrow , with a little more decorum , perhaps .
bridge .
it' s me .
you' re working late .
you got cragen' s panties in a bunch .
he' s scared you' il lose out on a big payout .
you tell him not to worry .
bridge will bring this home .
what you got on dunlap ?
okay .
married three times .
twice divorced .
brittney' s mother was the last wife .
committed suicide a year ago .
it was real nasty too .
took a long car ride off a very short jetty .
she' d found out about his reputation with the ladies .
what kind of reputation ?
he' s seen more pussy than an animal shelter .
i love it when you talk dirty .
had a world famous wine collection in the cellar of his $1 0 million mansion .
i wouldn' t expect anything less from a corporate tyrant .
that it ?
i always have more for you , t.
he was also a big time gambler .
seedy backrooms in miami , as well as legit tables in biloxi and atlantic city .
wouldn' t bat an eyelid at dropping a mil or two .
he was compulsive .
he learned to fly so he could squeeze in a little more time at the tables .
even taught stepdaughter brittney to fly so he could down a cocktail or two .
very interesting .
i overnighted dunlap' s medical records .
thanks , lacey .
you' re the best . where high school student maya king came forward ... ... claiming to be the illegitimate daughter of niles dunlap .
the room exploded in chaos when brittney havers ... ... attacked miss king upon hearing the news .
bailiffs restrained miss havers ... ... before the judge ordered the court adjourned for the day .
plot thickens .
and these are ?
letters , your honour .
from mr. dunlap to my mother .
love letters ?
no , i wouldn' t call them that .
tell me about them .
when were they written ?
after i was born .
summer of ' 84 .
my mother worked in the dunlap mansion .
one of her three jobs .
for the first month , he didn' t even talk to her .
lgnored her like she was a piece of trash .
but then one evening , that all changed .
suddenly he was all over her like a rash .
a few weeks later , she exploded the myth ... ... you can' t get pregnant your first time .
the very same day he fired her , he cut her a check ... ... gave her the name of a doctor he wanted her to see .
needless to say , she didn' t know what he wanted her to do with the money .
how could he not see the crucifix around her neck ?
this is an outrage !
we' re dragging a respected man through the mud ... ... based on the testimony of a less than reliable witness .
i will not tolerate any more interruptions !
miss king .
i' m sorry .
it' s just
it still hurts to think about .
mom put me in foster homes when she needed to save money .
i haven' t spoken to her in a couple of years .
last i heard , she moved to puerto rico .
i went through her personal stuff after she skipped town ... ... and that' s when i found those letters .
all from niles .
all threatening her ... ... if she revealed that he was my father .
order !
order !
miss king .
you' il be required to submit to a dna test ... ... which will be matched to the late mr. dunlap .
really ?
the results will be back in two days .
at which time this court will make a final ruling .
court dismissed .
there you go .
thanks .
let' s go .
now , what do we have here ?
niles dunlap , exhumation for dna testing .
that' s a killer .
cancer sticks .
everybody dies , believe me .
i' m sorry , i didn' t catch your name .
terence .
terence bridge .
term national life lnsurance .
well , mr. dunlap must be an important client of yours , huh ?
he was .
i wrote the policy myself .
now i' m on the hook for 2 million .
it' s gotta be a pain in the ass for you , this whole mess .
it' s no big deal .
when you finish doing the dna , could you give me a call ?
let me know ?
you' il be the first to know .
great .
now , if you' il excuse me , i gotta open this up .
i appreciate your help .
see you when i see you .
yeah .
you sure you don' t want some company tonight ?
no .
i just need some time to think .
bye .
you want to dance with me , baby ?
you want to dance ?
what do you want ?
what i' m owed , mija .
what i' m owed .
i don' t owe you anything .
seven fucking million dollars .
that debt don' t die with him !
look at me .
three days , i' il be back , mija .
and you don' t want to fuck with me , muchacha .
cicatriz .
do you swear to tell the truth , the whole truth , nothing but the truth ?
i do .
dr. haynes , have you completed the dna tests ?
yes , your honour .
let me see them .
and are you satisfied with these results ?
yes , your honour .
very well .
the dna taken from the person of maya king ... ... and checked against that of niles dunlap ... ... is a genetic match .
it is the opinion of the coroner' s office ... ... that niles dunlap is indeed the blood father of maya king .
as per the will , mr. dunlap' s 51 percent controlling interest ... ... in the dunlap corporation goes to miss maya king .
court adjourned .
miss havers was led away in tears after the ruling .
miss king stands to inherit the shares of the dunlap corporation ... ... valued at approximately $ 70 million .
ln a related story , a cuban national was detained here ... ... on suspicion of murder in the crash of niles dunlap .
thank you , linda .
mr. cicatriz was taken into custody today ... ... at his home in valley view .
no word yet on what specific charges ....
they got him .
christ , mr. bridge , don' t you ever sleep ?
i did , once .
it' s overrated .
well , come in if you' re coming in .
what did you find out about our rodent friend ?
a few bits and pieces .
i' il tell you one thing .
that was no ordinary swamp rat .
what do you mean ?
wasn' t quite sure myself , so i ran some tests .
i love rats .
they' re amazing .
they can survive a five story fall , swim for six hours ... ... crawl though a hole size of a quarter .
scavengers .
but not this guy .
he wasn' t settling for scraps of garbage .
he had a taste for the finer things in life .
like what ?
like this .
cork fragment .
i found it in its stomach with mould residue .
mould residue ?
from an expensive bottle of wine .
i' d say at least 20 years old .
trendy rat .
yeah .
i think it' s time to celebrate .
oh , shit .
why don' t you just kill those fucking things ?
that' s a $2000 bottle of wine .
you know i' m good for it .
we did it .
we did it , didn' t we ?
i saw they arrested the cuban guy ... ... and they' re charging him with niles ' murder .
see ?
what did i tell you ?
that cop just wants all his cases tied up in a pretty little bow .
nothing' s over until it' s over .
we haven' t even sold the company shares yet .
nothing' s foolproof , girls .
quit worrying .
this is the last time we' il be together before the money' s in the bank .
let' s make the most of it .
come here .
now kiss him .
beautiful , but deadly .
do i know you ?
the name' s terence bridge .
i' m handling your stepfather' s insurance claim .
lf you' re talking about niles ' $2 million policy ... ... you' re talking to the wrong person .
the melaleuca tree .
beautiful to look at ... ... but all it does is suck up the water around it until nothing is left .
everything dies around them .
really ?
that' s fascinating .
you know they found rats in your stepfather' s plane .
detective morrison told me .
now , if you' il excuse me .
rough night last night , huh ?
few too many drinks ?
must be tough to know when to stop ... ... when you have the most extensive wine collection .
what' s your point ?
just learned a long time ago ... ... when something doesn' t add up , you seek out the oddity .
good luck with that .
do you happen to have a rodent problem ?
just you .
who the hell does she think she is ?
that' s brittney' s spot .
hey , you' re parked in brittney' s spot .
haven' t you heard ?
she' s out .
i' m in .
so can i join your little nazi fashion clique now ?
you' re trash .
you always have been , and you always will be .
dyke .
maya .
what the fuck are you doing here ?
lf somebody sees us
come here .
what is it ?
the insurance guy , bridge ... ... was asking me about wine collections and rats .
and rats !
so ?
he knows .
he fucking knows !
don' t be so paranoid .
the insurance creep is on the hook for 2 mil .
he doesn' t care about anything else .
lf he goes to the police ?
he has nothing .
what if the cuban guy gets out of prison ?
he' il come after me .
he' il come after me .
don' t sweat your pretty little head .
i' il take care of you .
we' re in the clear .
maybe .
i want to fuck you so bad .
ls this a bad time , doctor ?
jesus , you almost gave me a heart attack .
well , we' re in the right place for that .
what' s on your mind , mr. bridge ?
niles dunlap' s medical record .
the man was 50 years old and more physically fit than a man half his age .
yeah .
a strong heart , low cholesterol .
ln fact , aside from some bouts with chicken pox ... ... and scarlet fever as a child , his medical record is unblemished .
that' s good for him .
doesn' t help him now that he' s toast , but good for him .
just out of curiosity , what are the long term effects of scarlet fever ?
that depends on the severity of the infection .
lf it was real bad , it could cause a heart murmur ... ... or sometimes eye or ear damage .
or sterility .
sometimes .
now , what if , and this is just a " what if " ... ... niles dunlap was sterile ?
well , that' s impossible .
you see , miss king proved that  i know .
i know , i know .
the dna was a perfect match .
you ran the test yourself .
right .
but it would throw a real monkey wrench into the works , wouldn' t it ?
wouldn' t it ?
lf he was sterile ?
sorry , i don' t wanna waste any more of your time .
lf you think of anything you can tell me ...
... just call me day or night .
all right ?
great .
harvard man , i see .
yeah . l
i went to morehouse .
but i' m just trying to figure out ... ... how a big time education at harvard can land someone like yourself ... ... at some small town coroner' s job .
just seems odd .
see you when i see you .
yeah .
what are you doing here ?
that insurance agent' s crawling up my fucking ass .
get the fuck in the house .
let' s go .
come on !
you fucking idiot , let' s go .
get in the fucking house .
damn it .
lf he could prove anything , he wouldn' t be an insurance agent , would he ?
he' s just fucking with you , see if you' il crack .
crack ?
i don' t think i' il get through this .
yes , you will .
just think about the 7 0 million .
and this .
so how did you do it , maya ?
how did you get the dna to match ?
what the fuck you doing here ?
i was just looking for maya king' s place .
well , you' re looking at it .
i know .
i was
look , man , i' m an insurance ... ... agent .
hey , whoa , just take it easy , okay ?
i' m just trying to give you my business card .
here .
want some light ?
all right .
here .
what do you want with her ?
well , you know , she stands to inherit a large sum of money .
from bobby santiago ?
i very much fucking doubt that .
bobby who ?
her father .
probably .
you never can tell .
hung around here when he wasn' t doing time .
died on the business end of a pig sticker in tallahassee a year back .
really sorry to hear that .
you wouldn' t happen to know where he would be buried ?
county dumped his box in the ground out at sapienza hill .
sapienza hill .
hello ?
fucking julian .
maya , what' s wrong ?
he' s losing it .
that insurance investigator' s nosing around ... ... and julian can' t take the fucking heat .
he wouldn' t do anything stupid , would he ?
abso fucking lutely .
we gotta deal with him .
what do you mean , " deal with him " ?
what do you think ?
we never planned on cutting him in .
let' s think about this before we do anything .
don' t think , brit .
just sit there and look pretty , and we' il be together forever .
papa king .
all right , miss king , if we can get your signature here .
and ... ... here .
all right .
all right ?
we' re finished here .
that' s it ?
seventy million dollars .
seventy fucking million dollars !
yes !
sixty nine million , 427 thousand , to be exact .
now , you' re sure you don' t wanna transfer this to an account ?
no , thank you .
a company check will do just fine .
hello ?
lt' s don e .
seventy million big ones .
i got the check in my hand .

using those pesky cellar rats to take niles ' plane down ... ... making it look like a cuban hit .
smart .
but not smart enough .
i called some local exterminators ... ... and i found out all about miss havers ' well documented rat problem .
and then , there' s the little matter ... ... of digging up maya' s rotting father ... ... and getting the coroner to switch the bodies .
very sexy .
you didn' t think about the fresh soil you leave behind ... ... digging up a body that' s been buried for a full year .
not sexy .
and last , but not least ... ... there' s the junkie coroner .
dear old julian .
now , that was a tough one .

really ?
yeah , well , l find that hard to believe .
it' s not your money .
what made you change your mind ?
eleven years of cutting checks to assholes in wheelchairs ... ... who later are dancing a fucking jig in maui .
paying fortunes out to abused wives whose husbands ... ... inexplicably decide to take baths with toasters , blow dryers .
eleven years of living out of a suitcase ... ... watching the rich get richer .
and a boss who' s just been looking for a reason to fire my ass .
so this is payback time .
oh , yeah .
yeah , that' s right .
for all the years i' ve played by the book .
now it' s time for old bridge to get what' s coming to him .
