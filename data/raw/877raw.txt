you' re being paranoid , paul .
these tests were conducted over a six month period , ... .. using a double blind format of eight overlapping demographic groups .
every region of the country was sampled .
the focus testing ... showed a solid base ... .. in the 9 to 11 year old bracket , ... .. with a possible carry over into the 12 year olds .
when you consider that gobots and transformers poll ...
.. 37 per cent market share , ...
i' m sorry . .. and that we are targeting the same area , ... .. i think that we should see one quarter of that .
and that is one fifth of the total revenue from all of last year .
excellent , paul .
thank you , thank you , thank you .
any questions ?
not for me .
yes ?
yes ?
i don' t get it .
what exactly ... don' t you get ?
it turns from a building into a robot , right ?
precisely .
well , what' s fun about that ?
well , if you' d read your industry breakdown , ... .. you' d see that our success in the action figure area ... .. has climbed from 27 per cent to 45 per cent in the last two years .
there , that might help .
oh .
yes ?
i i ...
i still don' t get it .
what ?
what don' t you get , josh ?
well ...
there' s a million robots that turn into something .
this is a building that turns into a robot .
what' s fun about playing with that ?
this is a skyscraper .
well , couldn' t it be , like , ... .. a robot that turns into ... into something like a ... like a bug or something ?
a bug ?
yeah .
like a big , prehistoric insect with claws ...
.. that could pick up a car and crush it .
in teresting .
a prehistoric transformer ?
in teresting !
gentlemen ...
the robot turns into a bug ?
uh , gentlemen , listen ...
he' s got a very good idea here !
the robot turns into a bug !
what ...
.. different sizes ...
we could do ladybugs .
you could have ' em wreck buildings .
a building is inert , a bug moves !
it' s got all kinds of possibilities .
this doesn' t just happen .
this guy ...
he didn' t just come to a meeting and say " bugs " .
uh ...
well done , josh .
well done .
oho !
oh , he is vicious !
he' s not vicious .
don' t kid yourself .

see you around .
there' s this flat screen on the inside with pictures on it .
you read it , and when you get to the bottom , you have to make a choice ... .. of what the character' s gonna do if he' s gonna fight the dragon , you push a button .
paul ?
i don' t get it .
well ...
paul !
it' s a comic book ...
see , there' s a computer chip inside , ... .. which stores the choices .
at the end of a page , you decide where the story goes .
that' s the point .
terrific , susan .
the kid makes his own decision .
this is possible ?
yeah !
in fact , it' s a very simple program .
isn' t that ...
isn' t that right ?
so what happens when you run out of choices ?
that' s the great thing .
you can sell different adventures .
just pop in a brand new disk , and you get a whole new set of options .
we could market this on a comic book rack .
mm hm .
i' il be right back .
how much would the unit cost ?
well , our initial figure was around , uh ... seven ... .. around seven dollars , ... .. with a retail cost of about ... 18 . 95 .
