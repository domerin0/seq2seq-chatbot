what do you think about it now ?
it was worth the risk .
for somebody you don' t even know ?
yeah .
and for what you do .
i think cops are great .
trying to keep it safe for everybody .
tough job .
firemen ... ... they' re heros . lkids wave at them .
people should wave at cops .
what are you laughing at ?
nothing .
ever think of how many people are here because you saved them ?
or helped them , or arrested somebody who would' ve hurt them ?
never thought about it .
or just because you did your job .
now i' m walking around because of you .
maybe you should be the cop .
wow , i don' t know .
i don' t look really good in hats .
what do you do ?
where do you live ?
where do you work ?

i' d like to walk .

i' m not drunk .

i' m on ashland , off 18th street .
i never drive .
why not ?
what ?
i was trying to picture you without your clothes .
excuse me ?
i didn' t mean it like that .
i mean , i' m trying to picture you out of uniform .
on your day off , in regular clothes .
i don' t live here .
i know .
this is where i live .
you know those guys at the bar ?
they' re my friends .
sort of .
we work together , we tell jokes , we bullshit .
i can' t say to them ....

every time i shut my eyes , i see that damn gun .
i hear that pop .
i feel a bullet slamming into my chest and ....
i don' t know why i' m telling you , except you were there ....
i must be drunk .
i want to know why you were walking by the stadium at that minute .
what if you hadn' t been there ?
i guess we were supposed to meet .
lf you want , you can come in for a bit .
okay .
you want a drink ?
no , thanks .
mind getting the door ?
sit down or something .
i' m circling a while .
don' t look .
i didn' t straighten up .
so ?
it' s more real this way .
it' s rude .
now i' m here , you seem mad about it .
trust me , when i' m mad , you' il know it .
it' s just i' m not ... ... used to letting anybody up here .
but you' re here , so ....
anyway ....
let' s talk about something stupid .
you first .
what' s that " supposed to " business ?
that we were supposed to meet ?
it sounds a little too psychic friends network to me .
some people say we each give off a particular odor ... ... that can only be detected by one other person' s brain .
so we smell each other .
who says that ?
i have no idea .
you' re crazy .
thanks for coming up here .
does that mean i' m going ?
no !
i mean , you don' t have to .
so you' re okay now .
what , are you here as a medic ?
ls this the " mad " part ?
maybe going is a good idea .
can i come back sometime ?
why ?
must be the smell .
i gotta go .
oh , god ....
what' s the matter , you blind ?
fucking idiot .
what are you guys doing here ?
hey , you !
your mom' s been bugging us to come for lunch .
mom , can we go now ?
ln a minute .
so how is she ?
she' s really good .
she' il be happy to see you .
my dad' s not here ?

you' re gonna come , i hope ?
come , shar .
i think you should .
aunt sharon , can i see your police car ?
come on , mom !
hold on .
i gotta go .
bye .
looks the same .
still smells like cigarettes .
thought he quit .
only six a day .
larry told you i stopped by ?
ls that why you called ?
i called you because we want you to come when we renew our vows .
how come you' re renewing your vows ?
it' s a sort of a fresh start .
your idea ?
both of us .
it' s a way of having the marriage blessed .
wasn' t it blessed before ?
of course it was blessed before .
you just ....
i just what , ma ?
you just think of the bad .
you never remember the good .
i wish you remembered that .
i wish i remembered it too .
does dad ?
does he remember anything good about me ?
he doesn' t hate you .
he just still feels hurt .
hurt ?
i hurt him ?
being arrested like that ?
nobody forgets that .
how did you forget what he did to you ?
it wasn' t as bad
you make it sound worse .
it hadn' t been like this for years .
i' m glad it hasn' t been that way .
that means it worked !
that' s why i did it !
why do i get punished for this ?
nobody' s punishing you .
we' re inviting you .
will you come ?
do you have a machine ?
what ?
do you have an answering machine ?
yes .
hang up , and i' il call your machine .
why ?
please leave a message after the tone .
it' s sharon .
maybe we can ... ... have breakfast or something .

like 8 or so ?
if you' re there , you' re there .
please leave a message after the tone .
hi .

i was expecting him this morning .
he shops for me .
i give him money from the settlement every week .

when he comes here , do you ever talk about the accident ?
does he ever mention the past ?
no .
why not ?
i try to let him find his own way through .
i feel he needs that .
why are you here , sharon ?
i want to know how to help him .
you are helping him .
i don' t think so .
what makes you think that ?
i took him to the cemetery

i thought it might help .
he needs to face it .
he will face it , in his time .
he built a wall around that whole day and that night .
my daughter and my grandson .
he can' t help it .
a cemetery ....
do you know how hard it is for me to go to the cemetery ?
i was just trying to help him get back to some kind of life .
he was coming back .
don' t you realize how he' s changed these past weeks ?
his apartment , his life ?
he fell in love .
why do you want to rush things ?
why does everybody rush things these days ?
i was scared .
scared of what ?
of losing him .
and i guess that' s what i did .
i lost him .
you were just trying to find your way .
what else can we do ?
you think i' m always sure about what i should or shouldn' t say to him ?
i just try to do what' s right ... ... and hope that he' il find the love in it .

max .
i don' t want you to think i forgot you .
it' s just that i couldn' t find you .
i woke up and you were gone .
everything was gone .
it just disappeared in one minute .
i couldn' t remember that minute .
i lost it .
but i think i found it all now .
i used a calculator , see .
do you know we get about 1400 minutes a day ?
so i figured it out .
i was ... ... 29 years old ... ... three months and eight days .
so it was minute number ... ... 1 7, 810, 200 or so .
that' s the one i lost .
when i lost that minute , i guess i ....
i tried to lose it all ... ... all the memories ... ... because it hurt so bad .
i tried , but ....
but i couldn' t do it .
max , you were sick that day , remember ?
it was your birthday ... ... and you ate too much .
slow down , it' s wet , okay ?
and you were right .
i should have slowed down .
i should have slowed down lots of times .
but i didn' t always listen .
i didn' t listen when you ... ... when you said , " steve , just please spend more time .
that day i made you smile , max , remember ?
you looked at me ... ... and i made a face ... ... and then we all smiled .
it was a great minute .
it was .
i' m so glad i found that minute .
and no matter what ... ... no matter what , i won' t forget anymore .
daddy !
i won' t forget anymore .
i love you .
don' t make him talk about anything today .
i know .
it was a nice ceremony .
we' re running out of chicken .
nobody' s eating the ham .
it' s still a great party .
you look happy .
30 years and still in love , huh ?
you think that' s wrong , don' t you ?

i' m asking you .

i feel like i don' t have a daughter anymore .
well ... ... you do .
and it' s a shame that you' il miss knowing her .
i' m next .
hi , mom , dad .
congratulations .
you know , being in this house reminds of something .
i was about 10 years old .
me and larry were playing alien invasion .
remember , lar ?
anyway , we were making a lot of noise .
dad came home from work , tired and pissed off .
we were yelling like mad .
what the hell are you doing ?
and i was scared .
i was really scared .
we' re playing alien invasion .
and he said , " i' il show you a damn alien invasion !
he picks me up .
he picks me up off the floor and he throws me on the couch .
then he grabs larry and picks him up and throws him on the couch .
and then ....
then he starts making monster noises .
he says , " we came to earth to kick ass !
me and larry , we' re running and jumping at him .
we' re laughing so hard ... ... l almost wet myself .
and we keep running and jumping on him , and he keeps tossing us .
and growling and beeping .
it was great .
it was great .
i' il never forget that .
and i miss that .
i miss it .
anyway , i just ... ... wanted to say thanks for that , dad .
thanks .
bye .
what are you doing here ?
you invited me .
are you okay ?
yeah , i' m okay .
i wanted to apologize .
for what ?
for wanting everything to be perfect .
you were right , i was pushing you .
then i realized that ... ... it doesn' t have to be perfect .
i mean ....
it can be whatever it is .
they don' t like me very much in there .
they' re lucky to have you in there .
that' s a nice thing to say .
it' s not a nice thing .
it' s the truth .
why do you try so hard not to cry ?
it' s not fair .
i did the right thing .
i know i did .
it' s not fair that they' re shutting me out .
there' s nothing i can do anymore .
i went , sharon .
i went to see my wife and my son today .
i told them that i love them and that i miss them .
and then i told them about you .
i told them how much i love you .
i love you .
i love you too .
i' il drive .
