mom !

the movie' s starting .

eve unveiled
they always change the title ! all about eve should be todo sobre eva .
but that sounds odd .
what are you writing ?
nothing .
future pulitzer winners .
all about my mother
eat up .
you have to put on a few pounds .
some day you may have to work the street to keep me .
you don' t need pounds for that .
you need a big dick .
where did you learn to talk like that ?
you asked .
i was joking .
and you ?
what about me ?
would you prostitute yourself for me ?
i' ve already done just about everything for you .
eat up !
autograph fiends !
they' re not people .
they' re little beasts that run in packs like coyotes .
they' re your fans .
they' re nobody' s fans .
they' re juvenile delinquents , mental defectives .
fans , indeed !
they never see a play or a movie .
they' re never indoors long enough .
well , there' s one indoors right now .
i brought her back to see you .
come in , eve .
i thought you' d forgotten about me .
not at all .
margo , this is eve harrington .
how do you do , my dear ?
hello .
would you like to be an actress ?
it was hard enough becoming a nurse .
if you were an actress , i' d write parts for you .
i was in an amateur group when i was young .
i wasn' t bad .
i must have a picture somewhere .
i' d love to see it .
i' il look for it later .
look , esteban .
i found a picture .
we were doing a show based on texts by boris vian .
cabaret for intellectuals .
happy birthday !
already ?
it' s midnight , sweetheart .
music for chameleons . how did you know i wanted it ?
i know you like capote .
read me something , like when i was little .
``preface .
i started writing when i was eight .
see ?
i' m not the only one . ``i didn' t know that i had chained myself for life ... to a noble but merciless master .
when god hands you a gift , he also hands you a whip ... and the whip is intended only for self flagellation .
that' s enough to put you off writing .
don' t be so lame .
it' s a wonderful preface .
how do you want to celebrate your birthday ?
i' d like to see one of your seminars .
why ?
i' m writing a story about you for a competition .
and i' d like to see you act in those organ donation courses .
well , i' d have to check with mamen .
she' s the psychologist in charge of the seminar .
fine .
do it .
i don' t think i like you writing about me .
your husband is dead , ma' am .
that' s impossible .
we just saw him in the icu .
he seemed to be breathing .
we' ve explained that , ma' am .
a machine is breathing for him .
would you like us to contact your family ?
i don' t have any family .
just my son .
my god !
how am i going to tell him ?
when he was alive , did your husband say anything ... regarding organ donation ?
did he care about such matters ?
when we was alive , he cared only about living .
but i presume he was concerned with the lives of others .
i don' t understand .
what my colleague means is that your husband' s organs ... could save other patients' lives .
but we need your authorization for that .
you could give him a transplant ?
not exactly .
the other way around , actually .
now we' il discuss what happened in the simulation .
look when you cross the street !
what were you thinking ?
i had an idea .
an idea !
give him the tickets .
why are you looking at me like that ?
do i look awful ?
no, you look better than ever .
look , that must be the gentleman you were expecting .
you aren' t mr. huntleigh !
neither are you !
these fingernails will have to be trimmed .
the jacket , doctor .
ask her to let go of me !
please !
let her go .
get up .

miss dubois .

i have always depended on the kindness of strangers .

stella , come here .
i' m never coming back to this house .

what if nobody comes out ?
let' s wait a while .
it' s my birthday .

nina cruz really moved you , didn' t she ?
no , not her .
stella .
twenty years ago , we did streetcar with the drama group in my town .
i played stella .
your father was kowalski .
some day you' il have to tell me all about my father .
all i know is he died before i was born .
it isn' t an easy story to tell .
i guess not .
or you' d have told me by now .
i nearly asked for that as a birthday present .
i' m not sure it would be a nice present .
you' re wrong .
it would be the best one .
then i' il tell you everything when we get home .
working in theater is worse than being a nun !
you think not being able to get stoned all day is being a nun !
yeah , i do !
alfonso xi street , number 30 .
come on , forget about it !

even better .
with an 1 8 year old' s heart !
i' il fix you some apple fritters .
no , he has to be careful .
last night , mom showed me a picture of when she was young .
half of it was missing .
i didn' t want to tell her , but my life is missing that same half .
i was worried .
i thought you' d never call .
i called as soon as i got to madrid .
i mean in argentina .
i called you loads of times ... but i must have got your aunt' s number wrong .
i wasn' t in argentina , mamen .
i went to coruna .
why did you go there ?
i went after my son' s heart .
who told you ?
how did you know ?
i looked in the files ... until i found the name and address of the transplant recipient .
you shouldn' t have .
it was wrong , and the best way to go crazy .
look at me , damn it !
i know that .
the best thing for me is to quit the nto and leave madrid .
i didn' t say that .
but you think it and you' re right .
i think i won' t even unpack .
you' re in no shape to travel alone .
you' re ill .
you have to rest up and get better .
i' il stay here tonight .
then come home with me .
i want to be alone , mamen .
try to be reasonable .
how ?
seventeen years ago , i made this same journey ... but in the opposite direction , from barcelona to madrid .
i was running away then too ... but i wasn' t alone .
i was carrying esteban inside me .
i was running away from his father then ... and now i' m going in search of him .
shall i keep going ?
yes , go on .
stop !
son of a bitch !
you' re crazy , you faggot !
son of a bitch !
what did you do ?
i hit him with a stone .
help me get him up .
get up .
come on .
come on, juan .
get up .
are you all right ?
stand up .
let' s get moving .
come on , quickly .
what a fucking useless psychopath !
look .
see that bonfire where the tops are ?
ask for ursula .
tell her agrado sent you .
she' il fix you up .
agrado !
it' s you !
manolita !
you' re hurt .
no , no , it' s your blood .
it isn' t because you saved my life , but how i' ve missed you !
eighteen years not a word , not a letter , not a fucking call .
i thought you were dead , bitch !
you can tell me everything at home .
we' il stop by a drugstore first .
can we get a taxi here ?
over there .
with any luck , we won' t get mugged on the way .
you got the knife ?
yes , and a rock in my purse .
hey , there , bona nit .
look , i' m sorry i woke you .
hey , come over here .
no .
what do you want ?
we' re not going to eat you .
what do you want ?
let me do the talking .
povidone iodine , approximation sutures ...
thrombocid , sterilized gauze and
you got any alcohol ?
no , i drank it all last night .
i mean for disinfecting .
no .
i' ve got vaseline , condoms and lots of bandages .
anything else ?
alcohol , please .
oh , manolita !
the barceloneta !
those were the days !
you remember ?
yes .
please , don' t move your head .
you know anything about her ?
about who ?
lola ?
unfortunately .
what happened ?
i took her in .
she was in a bad way .
as usual , with all the shit she takes .
i came back from working the field all night ... and she' d cleaned the place out .
watches, jewelry , ' 7 0s magazines that were my inspiration .
300, 000 pesetas .
what hurt most was ... she took a statue of the virgin that my mother gave me .
what for ?
she doesn' t believe in anything !
unless she' s in a satanic sect and wanted it for some ritual .
i see she hasn' t changed .
to do that to me , with all she owes me !
since we met in paris 20 years ago , i' ve been like a sister to her .
we got our tits together .
you know better than anyone .
you never saw her again ?
no , and i don' t want to .
are you looking for her ?
yes .
we' ve got unsettled business .
why did you go off like that ?
won' t you tell me anything ?
i can' t .
some other day .
all right .
just don' t disappear again .
i like to say good bye to the people i love ... even if it' s only to cry my eyes out , bitch .
i can' t believe it .
i look like the elephant man !
don' t exaggerate .
it' s just a bit swollen .
a bit swollen ?
where can i go with a mug like this ?
come and eat something .
why did you go to all this trouble ?
salad how wonderful !
it really hurts to chew !
i won' t be able to suck .
you shouldn' t work today .
what can i do ?
lola cleaned me out .
i have to work .
look , caramel spread !
and meat pie !
and my provoleta .
i have to work too .
if you want , we can look together .
oh , yes !
since you left , i haven' t had a decent meal .
well , also , as a model , i have to watch my figure .
the worst thing about this work is you' ve got to look cute ... and keep up with the latest advances in surgery and cosmetics .
you look terrific !
nothing like a chanel to make you feel respectable .
you look it .
don' t i look a bit of a slut in this suit ?
all the better .
these nuns only help whores and transvestites .
is that a real chanel ?
no !
how could i buy a real chanel with all the hunger in the world !
all i have that' s real are my feelings ... and these pints of silicone that weigh a ton .
i feel so old , manolita , and it isn' t my age .
it' s because of the beating .
the beating i' ve taken for the last 40 years !
hello .
come in .
are you looking for someone , or can i help ?
we want to see the girl who goes to the field .
the cute one .
sister rosa .
she' s inside .
go on in .
thank you .
rosa , look .
visitors .
what happened to your face ?
nothing .
a beating .
occupational hazard .
can we talk ?
of course .
let' s go next door .
it' s quieter .
my friend and i want to quit the street ... but we need to work .
cleaning stairs , whatever .
we don' t care .
there isn' t much else .
well , garbage collector , or learning handicrafts here .
embroidered tablecloths , dried flowers .
i think i prefer garbage collector .
what can you do , apart from the street ?
i' ve worked as a cook .
she' s practically a surgeon .
look at this face .
she did it .
better than pitanguy .
she' s a compatriot of lola' s .
really ?
have you heard anything about her ?
i haven' t seen her in 1 8 years .
she cleaned out my place .
she was here .
it must have been about four months ago .
we helped her through detox .
i cared for her through withdrawal ... but then she just disappeared .
i' d like to see her before i go to el salvador .
el salvador ?
maybe i' il sign on .
i always thought i could make it big in the third world .
then come with me .
i won' t be so alone .
the street' s getting worse here every day .
the whores were bad enough , but the drag queens are wiping us out .
i can' t stand the drag queens .
they' re sleazebags .
they confuse transvestism with a circus .
worse , with mime !
a woman is her hair , her nails ...
lips for sucking or for bitching .
i mean , have you ever seen a bald woman ?
i can' t stand them .
they' re all sleazebags !
i doubt there are many drag queens in el salvador ... but they' re in the middle of a war .
yeah ?
i didn' t know that .
i' m replacing some nuns who were murdered .
i' m not sure what i need right now is a war .
you' re terrible , agrado .
so you were a cook .
yes .
who ?
this one ?
the best !
what a surprise !
hi , mom .
are we interrupting ?
it doesn' t matter .
we see you so rarely .
this is manuela .
pleased to meet you .
come inside .
don' t just stand there .
mom , manuela is a cook ... and as florinda' s gone , i thought
thank you , darling .
vicenta and i can manage .
but how ?
dad alone needs two people .
where is he ?
out with the dog .
on their own ?
of course .
what if they get lost ?
the dog knows the way home .
don' t worry .
what a shame !
i really wanted to see them .
we' il go look for them , but first we have to talk .
come into the studio .
i' m sorry you came for nothing .
it' s all right .
try her for a few days .
think of dad .
manuela' s a nurse .
as well as a cook ?
yes .
i prefer to look after your father myself .
i understand .
thank you anyway .
i' il go .
good bye .
manuela .
yes ?
wait here .
i won' t be long .
how dare you bring a whore here !
it isn' t easy to find help who' il put up with you .
but a whore !
that' s no reason to be so rude .
i don' t like strangers to see me forging chagalls .
can' t you understand ?
manuela isn' t a whore anymore .
she' s given it up .
how long have you known her ?
since this morning .
this morning ?
you' re incredible .
my work is to help people ... even if i' ve just met them .
well , mine isn' t .
don' t look at me like that .
it doesn' t mean i' m intolerant .
i' il make you a deal .
a deal ?
i' il give that woman a chance if you don' t go to el salvador .
mom , don' t give me any more doubts .
i' ve got enough .
and so you should .
that trip is suicide !
no , it' s parricide !
well , i have to go .
manuela' s waiting .
sure !
any whore , any salvadoran , is more important than your parents !
don' t start , mom .
you should go see a psychiatrist .
it wouldn' t do either of us any harm .
didn' t you want to see your father and the dog ?
another day .
are you all right ?
good bye , mom .
hello , vicenta .
rosa , love .
you' re so thin .
aren' t you eating ?
yes , i am .
did you see a blonde girl downstairs ?
no .
so long .
take care and eat !
a streetcar named deslre
i' m sorry about my mother .
i' m sorry .
shall we go ?
i can' t deal with my mother .
she drives me crazy .
have you got parents ?
they' re dead .
so you' re alone .
i guess so .
you look awful .
i don' t feel very well .
i want to throw up .
i' ve got
here .
have you seen the doctor ?
you should .
it may just be gastritis .
can we go to your place until this passes ?
well
do you have a place ?
i' ve just rented one , but it' s barely furnished .
it' s quite a mess .
i moved in four days ago .
you want to lie down for a while ?
no , i' il just sit here on the sofa ... until it passes .
i' m going to take this off .
who' s this handsome boy ?
my son .
i thought you were alone .
he died in an accident .
oh , i' m sorry !
don' t touch the notebook , please .
come on , baby .
the worst is over .
don' t touch me !
don' t ever touch me again , bastard !
watch your language !
stella , come here .
i' m never coming back to this house .
never !
dressi ng rooms
come in , nina .
i' m not nina .
i' m manuela .
you shouldn' t be here .
nina' s gone .
what ?
where' s nina ?
i don' t know .
i just saw her run out .
she said she' d wait for me in her dressing room !
i can' t believe it .
it' s only been two weeks .
she can' t do this to me .
have you got a car ?
no .
where do you want to go ?
i don' t know .
can you drive ?
yes .
don' t tell anyone , but nina' s got problems with junk .
do you know where she' d go to score at this time ?
no , but it' s easy to find out .
thank you .
whoever you are ...
i have always depended on the kindness of strangers .
i can' t drive .
nina does the driving .
want one ?
no , thank you .
i started smoking because of bette davis .
to imitate her .
at 1 8 , i was smoking like a chimney .
that' s why i called myself huma .
huma' s a very pretty name .
smoke is all there' s been in my life .
you' ve had success too .
success has got no taste or smell .
and when you get used to it , it' s as if it didn' t exist .
god , where has that girl gone ?
i think that' s her !
you stay here .
i' il go .
he' s a son of a bitch .
he rips everybody off .
yeah , and since i' m not from here
don' t touch me .
listen , nina .
huma' s waiting for you .
who the fuck are you ?
she' s in the car .
i got everything .
fuck , my purse !
yeah , i got a purse .
ecstasy , toot .
who is it ?
it' s rosa .
hello .
how are you ?
are you alone ?
i just got up .
this late ?
i was out late last night .
some breakfast ?
no , thanks .
aren' t you hungry ?
so you' re back on the street .
just when i' d found another way for you to earn money .
tell me .
i' m not a whore .
i' ve been fucked around a lot , but i' m not a whore .
why did you lie to me ?
it was agrado' s idea .
the dress was hers too .
what' s this other way for me to earn money ?
i' m dying of curiosity .
how much would you charge to rent me a room ?
to rent you a room ?
why ?
i' m going to leave the center for a few months .
what about el salvador ?
i don' t feel well .
i can' t travel like this .
why do you want to move in here if you' re ill ?
i' m pregnant .
pregnant ?
what are you going to do ?
have it , of course .
what do you expect ?
i thought it' d be less of a scandal here .
can' t the father help you out ?
the father !
god knows where he is .
but you know who he is , don' t you ?
of course .
who do you take me for ?
i' m sorry .
it was your compatriot lola .
that lousy , fucking bitch !
what' s come over you ?
what' s come over me ?
how far along are you ?
three months , i think .
but i' m very worried .
worried ?
i' m not surprised !
i had bleeding this morning .
have you seen a doctor ?
i' m going to the hospital del mar tomorrow .
i wanted to know if you' d come with me .
yes , of course .
thank you .
what about the room ?
i' m sorry .
you can' t stay here .
good evening .
may i come in ?
hello !
i was expecting you .
i didn' t know where to send your purse .
here it is .
thank you .
is everything there ?
yes , everything .
thank you for last night .
not at all .
i' d love to talk more , but i' m short on time .
can i help you ?
could you button this ?
of course .
what was your name ?
would you like to work for me ?
doing what ?
everything .
everything except sleep with me .
i' ve got enough with nina .
well , the truth is i was looking for a job .
i need a personal assistant .
someone i can trust .
you don' t know me .
what i saw last night was enough .
but nina hates me .
nina hates everyone , including herself and me .
well ... when do i start ?
right now , if you can .
all right .
ask nina what she wants for dinner .
i' il just have an esqueixada .
anything else ?
could you get a tranquilizer for nina ?
she' s real edgy today .
i' ve got lexatin .
terrific !
don' t mention the father .
why do you dislike lola so much ?
lola' s got the worst of a man ... and the worst of a woman .
i' il tell you a story .
i had a friend who got married very young .
after a year , her husband went to work in paris ... and he was to call her when he got settled .
two years passed .
the husband saved some money and came to barcelona to open a bar .
she came here to join him .
two years isn' t a long time ... but the husband had changed .
he didn' t love her anymore .
the change was more physical .
he' d gotten a pair of tits that were bigger than hers .
oh , i see .
my friend was very young .
she was in a foreign land .
she had no one .
apart from the tits , the husband hadn' t changed that much ... so she ended up accepting him .
women will do anything to avoid being alone .
women are more tolerant , but that' s good .
we' re assholes ... and a bit lesbo .
listen to the end of the story .
my friend and her husband with the tits ... set up a bar here , on the barceloneta .
he spent the day in a tiny bikini , screwing everything he could ... and giving her a hard time if she wore a bikini ... or even a miniskirt .
the bastard !
how could someone act so macho with a pair of tits like that ?
sit down .
who is the patient ?
she is .
well ?
my sister is pregnant .
we reckon she' s about three months along .
this is her first checkup .
yesterday and today i bled a little .
lie down on the couch , and strip from the waist down .
don' t worry .
put this on .
thank you .
according to the ultrasound , the fetus seems to be fine .
do you live together ?
no .
yes .
which is it ?
she lives with our mother , but she hasn' t told her anything yet .
is your blood pressure usually high ?
yes , i have hypertension .
there' s a risk of miscarriage .
you must move as little as possible .
but i' ve got to do my job .
your only job now is to rest and not do anything stupid .
tell your mother to watch her blood pressure .
she has to follow a salt free diet and rest .
i' il tell her .
listen , doctor , i work with people who are high risk ... so i' d like to have an ai ds test as well .
what' s your job ?
she' s a social worker .
when can we pick up the results ?
in two weeks ' time .
you have to tell your mother .
you need to be looked after .
i found a job yesterday , and i' m going to be busy all day .
listen .
you' ve no right to ask me to be your mother .
you' ve already got one , even if you don' t like her .
we can' t choose our parents .
they are who they are .
oh , god !
please , don' t blackmail me !
i don' t know if i was right to call the clinic .
what else could you do ?
i can' t believe her and go on living with stanley .
then don' t believe her .
what matters is you and your baby .
what if she told me the truth ?
blanche ?
blanche is in no shape to tell the truth ... even if she wanted to , poor thing .
where is my heart ?
she means her jewel box .
it' s heart shaped .
i think it' s here somewhere .
look , here it is .
i need a necklace .
we' il look for it .
what' s the gentleman' s name ?
huntleigh .
did he call while i was in the bathroom ?
no .
how strange !
why are you looking at me like that ?
do i look awful ?
no , you look better than ever .
i' il look better with this necklace .
shall i help you ?
so you' re going on a trip .
you' re so lucky .
i' m green with envy .
there he is .
that must be the gentleman who' s come for you .
two weeks later
second call .
fifteen minutes .
come in .
aren' t they here yet ?
i don' t where they are .
i was at the tv studio all day .
where' s nina ?
wasn' t she with you ?
i just left her at home , in bed .
in bed ?
what' s wrong ?
i think it' s food poisoning .
she was so ill this morning .
why didn' t you tell me when i called ?
we didn' t want to upset you .
has a doctor seen her ?
yes .
she' s got gastroenteritis , but she' il be fine tomorrow .
so we cancel the show ?
i' d like to speak to huma , please .
yes , wait outside .
five minutes .
all right !
tell me the truth .
she' s bombed .
she can' t even speak .
she went out after you did .
she didn' t know i' d drop by .
she thought i' d be with you .
what do we do now ?
if it won' t give you a heart attack , i could do her part .
i know it by heart from hearing it over the loudspeakers .
but can you act ?
i can lie very well , and i' m used to improvising .
i' ve seen that .
my son said i was a very good actress .
i didn' t even know you had a son !
third call .
five minutes .
huma , what' il we do ?
we can' t wait any longer .
happy birthday , blanche .
this is your present .
thank you , stanley .
why did you bother ?
i hope you like it .
why , it' s
a bus ticket .
a return ticket for tuesday .
are you insinuating i should leave ?
what do you think ?
why did you do that to her ?
i' m sick of her insults .
i' m tired of you two whispering behind my back all the time !
please , don' t go !
let go .
you' ve torn my shirt !
brute !
brute ?
i was a brute when we met .
but i' d remind you that it was never a problem for you .
one day you showed me a picture of your house ... a mansion with lots of columns .
i pulled you down off those columns and taught you to be happy .
we laughed and were happy together ... until your sister blanche appeared .
what' s wrong ?
take me to the hospital , please !
congratulations on last night .
i heard you were great .
you can' t imagine .
what a pity you weren' t there .
i felt awful .
agrado called to tell me about it .
she must have called half of barcelona !
are you doing everything the doctor told you ?
i just saw him .
and ?
i went for my results .
i forgot it was today .
i' m hlv positive .
we' il have the tests redone .
why the hell did you screw lola ?
don' t you know she' s been shooting up for 1 5 years ?
what world do you think you' re living in ?
i don' t know .
have you spoken to your mother ?
your colleagues ?
no .
we' il go for your things now , and you' il move in here .
thank you .
hello .
hello , alex .
you were terrific last night .
thank you .
good evening .
here' s miss goody two shoes .
what' s up ?
what' s up ?
you planned it all , you bitch !
nina , don' t be so rude .
just like eve harrington .
you learned the part on purpose .
it' s fucking impossible to learn it over the loudspeakers .
you think i' m stupid ?
the loudspeakers helped me remember it .
i' ve known the part of stella for years .
really ?
what a coincidence !
if you only knew .
what did i tell you ?
why were you here that first night ?
or was that a coincidence too ?
no , it wasn' t a coincidence .
i won' t bother you anymore .
i' il get my things and go .
manuela , i think you owe us an explanation .
a streetcar named desire has marked my life .
twenty years ago , i played stella with an amateur group .
that' s where i met my husband .
he was playing kowalski .
two months ago , i saw your version in madrid .
i went with my son .
it was the night of his birthday .
it was pouring rain , but we waited outside ... because he wanted your autograph , huma .
it was crazy to wait in the rain ... but it was his birthday , so i couldn' t say no .
you two got in a taxi , and he ran after you .
a car coming along the street ran him down .
he was killed .
that' s the explanation .
that' s the explanation , huma .
move , rosa .
i can' t get past .
what are you doing here ?
hello .
i came to pay you .
you left yesterday without your money .
this is my sister rosa .
hello .
how are you ?
let me help you .
let' s get the elevator .
where' s nina ?
i left her with mario .
she says hi .
leave the bags here .
you go and rest for a while , rosa .
i' m not tired .
don' t argue .
sit down .
anything to drink ?
no , thank you .
she' s like a little girl .
i couldn' t sleep all night thinking about your son .
i can remember his face in the rain perfectly ... and the notebook in his hand .
i can see him now .
i don' t want to talk about my son .
i can' t .
apart from apologizing , nina and and i want you to come back .
rosa' s sick .
she needs someone to look after her all day .
i can' t leave her .
i' m sorry .
i don' t know what i should do .
why don' t you check nina into a clinic ?
if we don' t fulfill the contract , the company will sue me .
find a replacement ... and finish your run with the company .
i can' t do the play without nina .
she' s hooked on junk , but i' m hooked on her .
who was it ?
agrado .
and you let her in ?
you should have said we were busy .
i' m thinking of you .
come on , lie down here and stop moving around .
what exactly is wrong with you ?
an accident .
what kind ?
why didn' t i think of it before ?
agrado could take my place .
of course !
the one you didn' t want to let in ?
that' s something between us , but she' s perfect for you .
how old is agrado ?
pretty old .
between thirty and fifty .
is agrado her real name ?
no , it' s a stage name .
like huma .
you know why i took the name huma ?
yes .
manuela told me .
what else did she tell you ?
everything .
she told me everything .
about you and nina ... the junk ... and that it' il end badly .
really ?
and what else did she say ?
i' m very curious .
that as an actress , you' re wonderful ... but that as a person , you' re very mixed up .
and what else ?
that i shouldn' t say anything .
what have you got in the bag ?
cava and ice cream .
what for ?
to celebrate your success last night , bitch .
thank you .
come in .
oh , what a surprise !
three single girls in an empty house ... always reminds me of how to marry a millionaire .
how are you , sister rosa ?
huma , this is agrado .
my pleasure .
i' m fans .
how are you ?
huma , you' re a goddess , a living legend .
like i said , i' m fans , in the plural ... but my manuela was too much the other night .
how i bawled at the evening show !
shouldn' t you be in el salvador ?
yes , but i' m not going now .
i' m staying here .
agrado , i don' t work for huma anymore .
before you came , we were saying that you could take my place .
me play stella ?
i see myself more as blanche .
replacing me , not nina , and much less huma .
thank you , manuela , but i don' t
try her for a few days .
she isn' t as clueless as she seems .
i am , huma , and worse .
right now , i don' t get this at all .
so i' il give you the bottle to cheer us up a bit .
i brought ice cream .
come on , let' s have a drink and relax a bit .
i' il get the glasses .
i' il just have some ice cream .
i can' t drink alcohol .
well , i' il have a drink .
hey , what' s up with manuela ?
she seems very odd .
success hasn' t gone to her head already , has it ?
she wants to dump you on huma .
i think prada is ideal for a nun .
my problem is everything suits me , so i' m very eclectic .
i' ve had chilblains since i came to barcelona .
oh , really ?
it' s finished .
should i get more ?
i' d love some , but no .
where' s the bathroom ?
straight ahead .
excuse me .
fill me in on what' s happening here .
i' m no stranger .
i' il tell you tomorrow .
no , don' t !
she can' t keep her mouth shut .
i know very well how to keep it shut .
i played along like an english lady so she wouldn' t catch on .
i' m a model of discretion , even when i' m sucking someone' s cock .
i' ve sucked a lot of cocks in public places ... and no one' s noticed , except the person involved .
it' s been ages since i sucked a cock !
i love the word cock .
and prick !
i have to go .
are you all right ?
what ?
are you all right ?
better than ever .
can you help her find a taxi ?
i nearly forgot .
this is for you .
thank you .
well , good bye , girls .
so long .
you have to teach me how to bark .
i think i was a bit rude to huma .
i said all sorts of things .
really ?
it doesn' t matter .
they' re very different for sisters , aren' t they ?
are they sisters ?
that' s what manuela said .
well , if she says so .
i think you' re all bullshitters .
you have to get to know us .
can you drive ?
i used to be a truck driver .
really ?
in paris , before i got my tits .
then i gave up the truck and became a whore .
how interesting .
very .
a check .
1 50, 000 .
how generous !
what is it ?
huma' s autograph , for esteban .
and not because you didn' t try .
i have been foolish , casting my pearls before swine .
you mean me ?
you and your friend , mr. mitchell .
he came to see me and repeated the slander you' d told him .
so i threw him out .
you threw mitch out ?
he returned with a box of roses to beg my forgiveness . forgive me , he said , but some things are not forgivable .
cruelty is not forgivable .
it is the one unforgivable thing .
well ?
are you learning the part too ?
of course not .
you should, just in case .
you think so ?
may i have some privacy ?
so you can get your fix ?
can' t wait till the end ?
if you know , why ask ?
if you don' t want me to tell huma , do it in the bathroom .
i don' t need to see these things .
all right .
keep an eye on the door .
i know that when you' re young well , you' re no child you don' t value these things .
but you' re cute , nicely proportioned kind of small , but cute .
you' ve lost weight well , it' s all the drugs but the important thing is you' ve lost weight .
you' ve got talent
limited talent , but you' ve got it .
and , above all , a woman who loves you .
and you trade it all for junk .
you think it' s worth it ?
well , it isn' t .
it isn' t worth it .
i trade it for a bit of peace .
come on , help me .
you' re getting flat as a board .
compared to you .
what a dirty habit !
haven' t you ever thought of cutting it off ?
i' d get no work .
the clients like us pneumatic and well hung .
rheumatic ?
guys are so odd .
not rheumatic .
pneumatic .
a pair of tits as hard as newly inflated tires ... and a big dick as well .
show me your cock .
that fix didn' t agree with you .
maybe i' il like it too .
you' ve got enough problems as it is .
go , you' re on now .
and don' t throw up on anybody .
the audience loves it .
they think it' s because i' m pregnant .
you' re not pregnant in this scene .
you' ve had a doll .
that' s right .
will you show me your cock later ?
i' il show it to you and you can lick it .
young people will try anything !
months later
i' m going to call him esteban .
your son ?
why ?
after yours .
this baby will belong to both of us .
if only he did .
if only we were alone in the world ... without any commitments .
you and your son , just for me .
but you have a family .
i' m going to fix your hair and make you up a bit .
why ?
i like to see you look nice .
and i called your mother .
she' s coming to see you today .
my mother ?
you have a mother .
don' t you remember ?
what will i tell her ?
that you love her i don' t know .
come in , huma .
no , it isn' t huma .
may i come in ?
of course , mario .
come in .
you' re very early today .
yes .
what are you doing ?
just a bit of ironing .
is anything wrong ?
i didn' t sleep very well last night .
i' ve been on edge all day .
would you give me a blow job ?
can' t you all get it into your heads that i' m retired ?
i don' t want you to think that ... but since i' ve been on edge all day ...
i think a blow job would relax me .
you give me one .
i' m on edge too .
well , it would be the first time i' ve sucked a woman' s cock ... but if that' s what it takes
the whole company is obsessed with my cock !
it isn' t the only one around .
don' t you have a cock ?
yes .
do people ask you to suck their cocks because you' ve got one ?
do they ?
no .
well , then ?
look , i' il suck you off to show you how open minded ... and how sensitive i am about these things .
where' s the fucking phone ?
hello ?
all right , don' t worry .
i' il see to everything .
shall we go to my room ?
in case huma comes
huma can' t come .
she' s in the hospital , along with nina .
what' s happened ?
they nearly killed each other .
fuck !
here .
we' il have to cancel the performance .
don' t say anything .
we have to say something .
yes , but it doesn' t have to be the truth .
i' il make something up .
right .
and
hello , how are you ?
hello .
come in .
where is she ?
there , in the bedroom .
and here i was so worried , thinking you were in el salvador .
i see you' ve learned to lie .
i didn' t know how to tell you .
what are you going to do now ?
leave the order ?
get married ?
mom , the things you ask !
one never knows with you .
at least , i don' t .
even this i had to learn about through your friend .
what would i have done without her ?
how' s dad ?
same as ever .
i don' t know .
worse .
if you don' t mind , i' d rather not tell him anything .
he wouldn' t get it anyway .
and sapic ?
fine .
rosa , i don' t know what to do .
what do you expect me to do ?
nothing , mom .
you don' t expect anything from me ?
it isn' t that .
what i mean is don' t make it harder for me .
would you like anything ?
i' m making tea .
no , thank you .
what exactly is wrong ?
i didn' t understand over the phone .
according to the ultrasound , she' s got placenta previa .
when the time comes , she' il need a caesarian .
in the meantime , she must have complete rest .
do you think i should take her home ?
i have to look after her father as if he were a child .
you' re her mother ... but i think rosa' s better off here .
that' s the impression she gave me .
if you need money , just ask me .
and , please , keep me informed .
yes .
don' t worry .
thank you very much .
i' il see you out .
no , really .
i don' t know what i did wrong with rosa .
ever since she was born , she' s been like an alien .
do you have children ?
yes , one .
do you get along well with him ?
he died .
i' m sorry .
due to reasons beyond their control ... two of the actresses who triumph daily on this stage ... cannot be here tonight the poor things .
so the show has been cancelled .
those who wish can get their money back ... but for those who have nothing better to do ... it' s a shame to waste the rare occasion that you make it to the theater .
if you stay ...
i promise to entertain you with my life story .
good bye .
i' m very sorry .
if i bore you , you can pretend to snore like this .
i' il get the idea , and you certainly won' t hurt my feelings .
honestly .
they call me la agrado ... because i' ve always tried to make people' s lives agreeable .
as well as being agreeable , i' m very authentic !
look at this body !
all made to measure .
almond shaped eyes 80, 000 .
nose 200, 000 .
a waste of money .
another beating the following year left it like this .
it gives me character , but if i' d known ...
i wouldn' t have touched it .
i' il continue .
tits two , because i' m no monster .
7 0, 000 each , but i' ve more than earned that back .
silicone in
where ?
lips , forehead , cheeks ... hips and ass .
a pint costs about 1 00, 000 ... so you work it out , because i' ve lost count .
jaw reduction 7 5, 000 .
complete laser depilation ... because women , like men , also come from apes .
60, 000 a session .
it depends how hairy you are .
usually , two to four sessions .
but if you' re a flamenco diva , you' il need more .
well , as i was saying ... it costs a lot to be authentic , ma' am .
and one can' t be stingy with these things ... because you are more authentic ... the more you resemble what you' ve dreamed of being .
i' il turn you around .
please , be careful .
don' t worry .
we' il lift up a bit .
that' s it .
are you all right ?
yes .
if you can push it over here
i' il put this away .
thank you .
can you manage ?
yes .
to the hospital del mar , please .
can we go through medinaceli square ?
aren' t we meeting your mother at the hospital ?
i just want to see the square .
all right .
stop here !
i played here as a child .
sapic !
come here , boy !
hello , sapic .
that dog would go with anybody .
do you have a dog ?
no , but i really like them .
how old are you ?
twenty six .
and how tall are you ?
not very .
five six .
come on .
go on .
go back to dad .
come on .
good bye , dad .
you aren' t in any pain ?
no .
that' s great .
painless childbirth .
when is she going into surgery ?
in an hour and a half .
i' ve got time to go check on your father and come back .
you don' t have to come back , mom .
i want to be here with you .
give dad a kiss for me .
i' m keeping this one .
so long .
good bye .
i hope the third esteban is the definitive one for you .
the third esteban ?
lola was the first ... and your son , the second .
so you knew lola was the father of my son too .
of course .
it didn' t take a genius .
lola doesn' t know we had a son .
i never told him .
did your son know ?
no , he didn' t .
let' s not talk about sad things .
this is a great day .
they' ve put videla in jail , and your son' s going to be born .
promise me one thing .
what ?
if anything happens  what could happen ?
promise you won' t hide anything from the child .
i don' t have to .
you can tell him whatever you want yourself .
promise me .
if it makes you happier .
all right .
i promise .
we are here today to say good bye to our sister rosa .
manuela , i' m so happy to see you .
what a pity it has to be here .
it couldn' t be anywhere else .
you aren' t a human being , lola .
you' re an epidemic !
i was always excessive .
and i' m very tired .
manuela , i' m dying .
come .
i' m saying good bye to everything .
i robbed agrado to pay my ticket to argentina .
i wanted to take a last look at the town ... the river ... our street .
and i' m happy i can say good bye to you too .
now i just have to see sister rosa' s child .
my son .
i always dreamed of having a son .
you know that .
when i left barcelona , i was carrying your child .
what ?
you mean you too
did you have it ?
a beautiful boy .
i want to see him .
did you bring him with you ?
he' s in madrid , but you can' t see him .
even from a distance .
i promise he won' t see me .
it' s the last thing i ask of you .
you can' t see him .
please !
six months ago , he was run over by a car .
he' s dead .
i only came to barcelona to tell you .
i' m sorry .
the baby !
where have you been ?
haven' t you taken sapic out yet ?
you weren' t here .
i' m here now .
he' s hungry .
the bottle' s heating .
will you get it , please ?
come here .
vicenta , don' t let my husband come in here , please .
he' s convinced the baby' s yours .
yes , i know .
he' s very jealous .
i told him the baby was yours .
i don' t dare tell him the truth .
he wouldn' t understand anyway .
if only he were mine .
what is it ?
who' s that woman ?
it' s manuela , the new cook .
she' s been with us four days .
we' ve fixed up this room so she can be here with her child .
remember ?
i told you .
how old are you ?
thirty eight .
how tall are you ?
five seven .
all right .
now you can go for a walk .
go on .
there you are .
the bottle , ma' am .
thank you .
thank you .
no , no .
we' re going to eat now .
yes ?
don' t tell anyone about the antibodies .
do the nuns know ?
all right .
one month later
hello , lola .
take him .
what did the doctor say ?
he' s fine .
you can see he' s normal .
you' re with dad .
can i give him a kiss ?
of course .
my son , i' m sorry to leave you such an awful inheritance .
don' t say that .
there' s no reason why he should develop the disease .
this is our esteban .
you called him esteban too ?
thank you .
he wanted to be a writer .
this is his notebook .
he took it with him everywhere .
he wrote this the morning of the day he died .
read it . ``last night mom showed me a picture .
half of it was missing .
i didn' t want to tell her , but my life is missing that same half .
keep reading .
``this morning i looked through her drawers ... and found a bundle of pictures .
they were all missing a half .
my father , i suppose .
i want to meet him .
i have to make mom understand that i don' t care who he is ... or what he' s like ... or how he behaved towards her .
she can' t deny me that right .
keep the picture .
thank you .
i don' t like just anyone kissing the baby .
who was that woman in the bar with you ?
that woman is his father .
what did you say ?
that was his father , and he' s very ill .
that monster is the one who killed my daughter ?
don' t think about that , rosa .
there are people who think children are made in a day .
but it takes a long time a very long time .
that' s why it' s so awful to see your child' s blood on the ground .
a stream that flows for a minute and yet costs us years .
when i found my son ... he was lying in the middle of the street .
i soaked my hands in his blood and licked them .
because it was mine .
animals lick their young , don' t they ?
i' m not disgusted by my son .
you don' t know what it' s like .
in a monstrance of glass and topaz ...
i would put the earth soaked by his blood .
keep kneading .
the sadness should go into your hands .
work .
you have to work .
you don' t notice my cold ?
no , it' s fine .
come on .
you shouldn' t be in here .
hello .
i' ve got a bouquet for agrado and huma rojo .
really ?
yes .
sign here , please .
you sure it' s for agrado ?
yes , it says so .
here .
know why they call me agrado ?
i' ve always tried to make life agreeable for others .
right .
running away once again with no good byes ... though i know how much you like them , agrado .
the situation with rosa' s parents is unbearable .
the grandmother is afraid a scratch will infect her .
i' m taking esteban where he won' t be surrounded by hostility .
agrado, you know how much i love you .
take good care of yourself and of huma .
i' m sorry to miss the opening ... but i' m sure the homage to lorca will be a great success .
i' il write to you ... but it' s better you don' t know any more .
oh , and tear up the letter .
your manuela .
two years later
i' m coming back to barcelona after two years ... but this time i' m not running away .
i' m going to an alds conference organized by can ruti .
my esteban has neutralized the virus in record time ... and they want to study his case .
i' m so happy .
may i ?
hey , she' s mine too !
you look beautiful !
your hair' s gotten so long .
and so has yours .
no , this is a wig for the play .
wait , your earring' s loose .
i' il fix it .
learn , you animal !
an animal , but who takes care of you like i do ?
it' s great about your son !
so he' s neutralized the virus practically overnight .
yes .
esteban' s case proves the virus can disappear .
they' re still trying to find out why , but it' s a miracle .
i knew it .
how i prayed for that child .
why not stay with us while you' re in barcelona ?
of course .
we' re staying with his grandparents .
rosa' s mother is looking forward to it .
she' s changed so much .
third call , five minutes .
i have to go .
you' ve got esteban' s picture .
lola gave it to me before she died .
i was keeping it until you came back .
keep it .
thank you .
and nina ?
i have to go .
nina got married .
she' s back in her home town .
she' s got a baby too .
it' s fat and horrible .
really , really ugly .
i' il see you later .
