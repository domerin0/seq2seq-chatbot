information " ... the very nature of the word is beginning to change .
the world is shrinking .
borders are collapsing ... cultures are growing closer and closer day by day .
information is the new unexplored frontier .
and in the forefront of this new age is , of course ... the internet .
are you sure this is a big story ?
scoop , " joaquim .
the proper term is scoop .
and , yeah , i' m sure .
cute secretaries don' t lie .
well ...
hank , you' re my hero .
hey , where are you going ?
press .
do you have an appointment ?
there' s a coup going on in that boardroom .
that' s news .
you need an appointment to get in .
7tv , hank robinson , right there .
okay , rock and roll .
public broadcasting ?
is that a problem ?
take it easy , hank .
no , take it easy ?
i' m not going to take it easy .
i don' t need this guy keeping me out of here ... because he doesn' t like the company i' m working for .
how come he waltzes through ?
seor aribau has the exclusive rights to all nova communications .
the number of people who get their news from the internet ... as opposed to , you know , tv or newspapers ... grows by 1 million worldwide each year .
one million .
just follow my lead , and it' il be fine , okay ?
good morning , christina , you look beautiful .
can i see the boss ?
just a minute , please .
the conclusion is obvious .
he who controls the internet ... controls information .
in the last three years , nova communications ... have carved a widening niche in the telecommunications market .
well , i believe it' s time we expanded .
did you call the press , seor pla ?
no , i did not .
if you think something newsworthy is going to happen today ... you are very much mistaken .
you may be our main stockholder , but i' m still president of this company .
i direct policy .
nothing will change that .
hank robinson reporting from barcelona .
i am standing in front of the headquarters of nova ... the fastest growing telecommunications company in spain .
today , majority shareholder manuel pla is challenging nova president sert ... inside the boardroom , while i stand out here in the parking lot .
come on , let' s go again .
take two .
what' s this ?
this is my offer , seor sert .
quite generous , i think .
you' re trying to buy me out ?
we get a two shot and we go to lunch , okay ?
everybody down !
on the floor .
now !
don' t move !
oh , no !
what the hell is that ?
what the hell is going on here ?
what' s the meaning of this ?
oh , my god !
jesus christ !
let' s go .
go ?
go where ?
in there , where the story is .
you know what else is in there ?
someone with a gun .
give me the camera .
no !
fine .
nothing is worth dying for , man .
call the police , i' m going in .
hank .
who are you people ?
we are anarchy now .
your company spreads lies to confuse innocent people .
gunfire at the nova offices .
always make sure there' s film in the camera .
you support the capitalist pigs .
this is your reward .
all of you , get out of here !
come on , run !
run !
tell everyone the truth .
boss !
listen , call veronica .
tell her i' ve got footage of sert' s murder .
acts of terror have become so commonplace in our age ... that we run the risk of becoming used to their images ... to becoming desensitised to them .
the day that these shocking , horrific images fail to appal us ... is the day that we begin to lose some of our humanity .
let' s let these images speak for themselves .
i , for one , will not soon forget them .
my favourite part' s coming up .
this is hank robinson reporting ... with a 7tv news exclusive .
and we' re out .
pure genius .
it helps to have the hottest producer in town .
all the major wires called .
they want to licence your video .
bleed them dry .
and our ratings are climbing .
we got 20 share tonight .
thousands of people tuned in .
how does it feel being a star ?
twenty share ?
speaking as your producer , i' m thrilled .
speaking as your girlfriend ... don' t ever risk your life like that again .
with great risks come great rewards .
what you did was the most inspiring thing i' ve ever seen .
veronica .
that tape ...
the thing is ...
i just  proved to the world ... what i' ve always known .
you' re the real deal , hank .
i love you .
and i don' t want to lose you .
i love you , too .
i have to rinse .
yes , i understand all that , but just get him for me .
at 3 : 00 , you' re interviewing cardinal rosselli .
i thought he never meets the press .
he agreed to talk to you .
this is a real scoop .
ronnie .
i' m getting audio interference on camera 2 .
interference ?
either god' s talking to us ... or it' s someone' s cell phone .
his polls are rather low .
excuse me , sir .
can' t you see the sign ?
i' m most terribly sorry .
very thoughtless of me .
nicola , i' il have to call you back .
i' m archibald mcgovern .
and you are veronica nadal .
top of your class of the barcelona school of journalism .
1999 ?
' 98 , actually .
i' m here to see mr. robinson .
so , this is 7tv .
well , it' s quaint .
is your studio fully soundproof ?
of course .
some of the equipment has been here since the ' 60s .
that' s all , it needs to be replaced .
a journalist of mr. robinson' s stature deserves better .
we are only a local station , we take what we can get .
jordi , what the hell are you doing ?
sorry , miss nadal .
you can start by replacing him .
excuse me .
hank robinson ?
archie mcgovern , owner
and ceo of vision television news .
pleasure , sir .
pleasure to meet you .
i' m sorry , this will have to wait .
hank goes on in 10 minutes .
have you met veronica , my producer ?
oh , yes , indeed .
and i will only take five .
you have to forgive her .
she' s a little protective .
and rightly so .
you' re her gold mine .
so that' s mcgovern .
seems like a nice guy .
yeah , that' s just what they said about hitler .
okay .
let' s get hank' s sound levels up .
weil , we did start 7tv together .
shall we ?
it' s kind of our baby .
scrimping and scavenging for every cent ... hunting down stories , hoping and praying for the exclusive ... that would put you on the map .
yes , i know that life .
i know it very well .
so tell me , hank , how many viewers does 7tv get a week ?
70, 000 ?
100, 000 ?
55, 000 , sir .
vision tv ... is watched by 10 million people every night , and growing .
i know , sir .
what can i do for you ?
mr. robinson , i' m here on a rather serious matter .
the late carlos aribau .
did you know that he worked for me ?
yes , he was a wonderful reporter .
he' il be missed .
on the morning of the nova attack , i sent carlos to interview seor sert ... and then , your story came to my attention .
mr. robinson , you represent ...
well , hank , you represent everything ... that vision tv has come to stand for .
and i would like you to join our family .
i beg your pardon ?
that' s right , hank , your gravy train has come in .
i' m going to have to talk to someone about that .
i understand .
i' m sure she will realise what a grand opportunity this is for you .
bring her along if you like .
thank you , sir .
of course he wants to hire you .
guys like mcgovern are afraid of guys like you .
you report the story .
mcgovern , he reports the official story .
he gets us into 10 million households .
yeah , but at what price ?
my father worked for 10 years before the networks called ... and when they did , he jumped at it .
hank , we are so close to achieving everything we wanted .
don' t throw away our independence .
it' s a good thing .
this is a good thing .
you made a decision like that without me ?
i' m your partner , i' m your girlfriend .
they promised to hire you .
i already have everything i' ve ever wanted .
at least , i thought i did .
veronica , please sit down .
women .
let me buy you a drink .
no , i got to go .
i think you' re doing the right thing .
vision tv , man .
that' s a big time .
yeah .
need a cameraman ?
you know what ?
i' il bet they probably do .
i' il ask them , all right ?
you do that .
hank .
yeah ?
my camcorder ... the one you filmed your nova story with .
it wasn' t loaded .
sure it was .
no , it wasn' t .
i number all my tapes .
it was empty .
what' s your point ?
none of my business how you got the story .
just share the wealth , you know ?
i' m a talented guy , and i' m shooting porn to make ends meet .
it' s a fucking crime .
are you blackmailing me ?
no , i would never do that .
we' re friends , right ?
yeah .
friends do friends favours .
sure they do .
so , good karma .
we understand each other .
oh , yeah .
we understand each other .
terrific .
i' il be seeing you , hank .
hey , hombre , that' s my beer .
hey , hank !
here' s to us .
partners forever !
okay .
i can' t get this all done .
no , you' re not listening to me .
the founding of iran by howard robinson .
your father' s book was required reading in class .
barcelona school of journalism .
i' m marisa perez .
i' m your assistant .
this is my first job .
hello , marisa .
it' s okay .
it' s my first time having an assistant .
miss markham is waiting for you in the newsroom .
of course , nicola markham .
yeah , she' s our news director .
all right , the chinese plan to have a man on the moon by the end of the year .
right , if their entire population stands on each other' s shoulders .
you' re late .
sorry , i didn' t realise there was a meeting .
news happens every day , robinson , and every day we report it .
that' s why we are called a news service .
eduardo , the chinese astronaut is yours , a present from me .
and next , in africa , alds epidemic is at an all time high .
katrina , you run with that .
and in local news , barcelona is once again in the champion' s league .
make it the lead story .
okay , what are you waiting for ?
impress me .
not so fast , robinson .
call me hank .
robinson , how the hell did you end up in spain ?
i thought there were more career opportunities in europe .
meaning you couldn' t cut it stateside .
if you want to last here , you will follow instructions , claro ?
claro .
good .
after assuming control of nova ...
manuel pla set his sights on his main rival , intertel .
if pla succeeds in purchasing intertel ... he will have a virtual monopoly on the telecommunications market .
first spain , then europe .
precisely .
i want you to interview eloy agustin , the head of intertel .
find out why he won' t sell , and what he intends to do about it .
questions ?
no , ma' am .
good .
i was in tehran with your father during the revolution .
you look a lot like him .
i hope i' m half the reporter he was .
careful what you wish for .
seor agustin , you' re dealing with a hostile takeover bid from nova .
how are you planning to deal with the threat ?
i have faith in the loyalty of my stockholders .
they realise nova is trying to force everyone out of business .
that may be , but we deal in a free market society .
can you really fault them their success ?
think of a world in which one company provided every service .
without competition , there is no need to maintain quality , or accountability .
information should belong to everyone .
the internet should be free .
unregulated .
thank you , sir .
this is hank robinson reporting from intertel .
we have the edit suite booked for noon ... so with any luck , we should be done tomorrow afternoon .
are you enjoying your new job ?
i am , yes .
your predecessor , carlos aribau , was a friend of mine .
was he ?
did you know him ?
our paths crossed briefly .
listen , i' d love to chat , but i must run .
thank you .
of course .
good luck .
i hope this business doesn' t victimise you the way it did carlos .
what do you mean ?
you know what it' s like ... trying to weed out the liars from the honest men .
in the end , carlos trusted no one .
not even his best friends .
hello .
did i wake you ?
who' s this ?
you' ve got 45 minutes .
time for a piss and a shower .
hurry up .
i' m not going anywhere until you tell me your name .
nova , hank .
the anarchist attack , remember ?
you didn' t sit on your ass .
you went out there and got the story .
what do you want ?
the gothic knights bar , robinson .
45 minutes .
and , hey , make sure there' s film in the camera this time , okay ?
nothing personal .
you' ve seen too much .
seor agustin ... wants you dead .
did you confront agustin ?
of course .
he got uptight ... claimed his private life was nobody' s business .
sounds like he doesn' t know this girl is a killer .
he knows .
he' s hiding it .
conjecture .
it all fits .
who' s agustin' s biggest rival ?
nova .
who did the terrorists attack ?
nova .
who benefits ?
agustin .
talk about aggressive business practices .
it' s still all conjecture .
we operate on facts .
i saw her at nova' s office .
i saw her face .
you' re a reporter .
your word isn' t proof .
you need corroboration .
nicola may be a bit overzealous at times , but she has a point .
yes .
looking forward to seeing it .
you' il have to excuse me .
thank you for your time .
mr. robinson ?
manuel pla .
i recognise you from tv .
and the lovely ...
marisa perez .
marisa is my assistant .
pleasure .
congratulations .
your company' s fortunes have really turned around .
well , in part thanks to mr. robinson .
he made us famous .
and if we succeed on acquiring intertel ...
enjoy yourselves .
thank you .
would you like a drink ?
sure .
scotch is great , thanks .
hi .
how are things ?
fine .
i mean , sure , we' re in a ratings slump right now ... but we' il turn it around .
i' ve met a few young reporters with a lot of potential .
you look beautiful .
so , that' s your date ?
marisa ?
yes , she' s my intern .
is that what they call it now ?
i miss you .
a lot .
can we get together ?
talk ?
i' ve left some of my things at your place .
well , come on by .
anytime .
i' ve got a story to cover .
hey , i know you .
tv .
it must have been scary .
what' s that ?
alone , filming the anarchists .
they weren' t just angry young kids with cap guns .
top of the line uzis , classic commando assault .
i' d say they had training , financing , backing .
someone developed anarchists now .
and that someone is running the show .
i' m sorry , i didn' t get your name .
i' m a cop .
brechner , interpol .
on duty ?
always , keeping an eye on things .
don' t want a repeat of the nova incident , do we ?
agent brechner , you mind if i ask you a few questions ?
you on duty ?
always .
why not ?
you identified any of the anarchists ?
we have our suspicions .
one of them is a woman .
you know her name ?
do you ?
i have a story .
my bosses won' t let me run it until i get corroboration .
if i show you a picture , can you confirm it ?
you can' t name me .
anonymous source .
what do you need ?
her name is leila krtolica .
anarchy now' s aim is to create chaos ... to destabilise governments , eventually create a new world order .
businesses represent capitalism to them , their most hated enemy .
already this year they' ve claimed 28 victims .
leila made interpol' s most wanted in june .
now she' s in spain .
but what' s her connection to agustin ?
terrorists need funding .
it' s hard to blow up bombs on an empty stomach .
you tell me eloy agustin is a sponsor of terrorism ?
according to my interpol source .
they' ve been watching him for years .
looks like you' ve got your corroboration , nicola .
okay , robinson .
impress me .
what is the connection between anarchy now operative leila krtolica ... and eloy agustin of intertel ?
recently , krtolica assassinated the president of nova ...
agustin' s greatest rival .
coincidence ?
seor agustin has denied any connection with any terrorist group ... and maintains he is the victim of a frame up .
cut .
thoughts ?
not bad .
careful .
you don' t want to hurt yourself praising .
you did your job .
what do you want , a cookie ?
we' il lead with it tonight .
happy ?
jesus , veronica , i thought you were looking for ...
so what are you doing here ?
i told you , i left some things behind .
you weren' t home .
i still have my key .
which reminds me .
so long , hank .
i' m sorry .
i' m just ...
sorry , i' m a little high strung lately .
i saw your report tonight .
you watch vision tv ?
only when you' re on .
and ?
you did good .
i' m happy for you .
thanks .
careful , hank .
i am humbled by the trust i' ve been given in being appointed nova' s new ceo .
i vow to lead nova and its new acquisitions ... with integrity and vision , into a prosperous future .
in the furore following the allegations surrounding eloy agustin last week ...
intertel stockholders voted unanimously to sell their company to manuel pla .
seor agustin , meanwhile ... is under investigation by the chief magistrate' s office .
this is hank robinson with vision tv signing off .
didn' t your father ever teach you to keep your powder dry ?
your story on agustin caused quite a stir .
i' ve had the chief magistrate on the line all morning .
just the result of good journalism , i guess , sir .
yes .
free publicity is priceless .
actually , i was thinking more about the social value .
we exposed killers .
ever wonder what a limey like me was doing in spain ?
i love it .
still virgin territory , pure .
it' s waiting to be developed .
the rest of europe is so cynical .
it' s too knowing .
and together we going to make this city the centre for world news .
and i have faith in you .
we' re onto something wonderful .
you can' t learn to be a journalist from a book .
didn' t they teach you anything at school ?
yes .
we had a saying .
believe nothing of what you hear , and half of what you see .
that' s a good motto .
hello ?
yes , he is .
hold , please .
you' ve got a call on line 1 .
thank you .
hello .
good morning , partner .
caught your piece last night .
good job .
you going to give me your name this time ?
call me crusader .
okay , crusader ... how did you know that agustin was sponsoring terrorism ?
a magician never explains his tricks .
listen ... why me ?
you' re a rising star , hank .
you could go far .
i look forward to working with you for a very long time .
listen , how do i get a hold of you if i need you ?
you were handed the story on a silver platter .
what are you complaining about ?
i don' t trust him , or like him .
you' re beginning to sound like carlos aribau .
he thought his sources were cooking up stories .
what ?
okay , i know what this is about : fear of success .
you' re on the verge of surpassing your father ...
and the thought of it scares you .
bullshit .
just do your job !
here , another early story by carlos aribau .
anything interesting ?
the usual .
local news , some crimes , some human interests .
you' re a walking encyclopaedia , marisa .
listen ... how did aribau make it big ?
i heard , out of nowhere , he got a lead .
something really big .
out of nowhere ?
aribau had a secret source .
he never revealed who it was .
probably never knew .
after that big story that make him famous ... he was offered a job at vision tv , and the rest is history .
yeah , what was it ?
that first big job ?
industrial espionage .
some telecommunications companies has been accused of violating antitrust laws .
aribau would champion their cause and prove their innocence .
i was in high school , but i remember it was a big deal at the time .
manuel pla .
manuel pla would have been ruined , but aribau saved him .
the attack on nova , agustin' s downfall .
over and over ...
pla benefited .
seor agustin ?
seor agustin , we need to talk .
this is my home .
for 20 years !
i founded this company , and you ...
you took it away !
we were set up .
the both of us .
now , how did you meet the girl ?
she came up to me , at the conference .
she was interested !
you are a man .
a woman that beautiful is interested in you , do you chase her away ?
she said you wanted me dead .
and you believed it .
you , the great reporter !
i made a mistake .
i' ve been in business for a very long time .
this isn' t over yet .
tell me what you know .
i asked my own questions , hired my own investigators .
leila is no anarchist .
she' s no terrorist .
she' s a cold , methodical killer .
she' il kill for you if the price is right .
are you telling me she' s a mercenary ?
the americans have a term for people like her .
they call them " security contractors .
who hired her ?
manuel pla ?
pla ?
only a fool .
others behind him .
tell me who , seor agustin .
tell me .
god , it' s them .
you brought them here !
seor agustin .
no !
you did all you could , mr. robinson .
you are a hero .
a hero would have saved him .
two assailants , one male , one female .
anything you can remember about them ?
they had on , what do you call it ?
the motorcycle mask .
i' m sorry .
one moment , please .
robinson .
don' t say another word .
are you all right ?
everything is fine .
yeah , everything is fine .
it' s an important call .
it' s an important call .
take your time .
listen , you son of a bitch , i am onto you .
you set up agustin .
don' t be so melodramatic .
take a deep breath , calm down .
i am coming after you .
do you understand ?
i don' t exist , hank .
i' m a whisper , a breath on the other end of the line .
you set up agustin and you set me up .
you want me dead next ?
i do hope it doesn' t come to that .
i' m enjoying our relationship .
i have many , many more stories to tell you .
you can' t manipulate me .
i' m not carlos aribau .
no , you' re worse .
carlos never stepped on corpses to get a story .
mcgovern .
hank !
have you been in an accident ?
listen to me .
agustin has been murdered .
he was strangled , and left hanging like a piece of meat .
murdered ?
yes .
are you sure ?
yes .
the police are calling it suicide .
what ?
they found a note in his home , and there is an eyewitness .
what are you talking about ?
that' s insane .
i saw it , i was there .
all right , hank , i believe you ... but this is a news service .
you' il never get this past nicola without proof .
markham .
what time did it happen ?
take it easy .
i got some bad news .
it' s about agustin
feeling the unyielding hand of the law closing in on him ... and filled with remorse over his terrorist activity ... he lynched himself .
mcgovern scooped you .
but ... how did he know ?
veronica ?
okay , come on , everybody , run !
give me the fucking gun !
veronica , hi , it' s me .
listen , can you meet me at the station ?
so , hank , how are they treating you at vision tv ?
good ?
can' t complain .
do you get overtime ?
' cause we don' t .
pedro .
did they give you an assistant ?
yeah .
is she a babe ?
pedro , the tape .
well , the tracking' s screwed up .
was the camera damaged in any way ?
well ...
we could dump both picture and sound on a computer ... and run a component program .
i' ve got just the thing for that .
the computer would digitally adjust the tracking .
it could clean up over 90 % of your sound and image .
how long is that going to take ?
a day .
do it .
now , about your assistant ?
okay , pedro .
thank you very much .
she' s a slave master .
you' re lucky you escaped when you did .
let me see if i understand .
the anarchy now attack ... it was all a ploy to disguise sert' s murder .
they killed the president of nova so that manuel pla could take over ... and they framed agustin so pla could control intertel , right ?
you were a witness .
you saw everything .
why didn' t you expose them ?
i didn' t know what i had .
the first time i looked at the tape , it looked like a bunch of static .
what do you mean , " the first time " ?
you shot this , didn' t you ?
whose tape is this ?
carlos aribau' s .
veronica , come on !
you robbed a dead man .
have you no shame ?
the cops .
they examined the tape .
why didn' t they catch this ?
because i gave them a dub .
okay ?
i kept the original .
i hid it .
they are going to crucify you .
why ?
why did you do it ?
because ...
all my life ...
i was living in my father' s shadow .
all my life , i wanted to ...
i just ...
i just wanted to be the best , i just wanted to please .
it was there .
i saw it .
it was in my hand , i just took it .
i just did it .
okay ?
i just took it .
i' m not this guy .
i' m not .
marisa .
good luck .
mr. mcgovern ?
i bet you think you' re quite the hotshot .
is there a problem , sir ?
you , robinson , and your story .
your story on agustin put us at the top of the ratings .
congratulations .
i know someone who' s going to be very happy with his christmas bonus this year .
wow .
thank you .
don' t mention it .
you know , maybe as a follow up , you should do a story on nova .
you know , how manuel pla saved the company after the terrorist attack ... and turned its fortunes around .
fair and balanced , of course .
of course .
good .
an agent brechner from interpol called three times this morning .
the great game .
it' s a term the british used during world war i for espionage .
they used people as game pieces and the world as a board .
a board game .
kind of like monopoly .
except in monopoly , the game pieces don' t die .
listen , agustin was murdered .
i know .
there' s a new player in the game .
leila' s partner , paul wolf .
six feet tall , german , very professional .
listen , i' ve been getting calls , anonymous tips .
i' m thinking this wolf may be using me somehow .
what ?
as a patsy , to cover up his crimes .
i don' t know .
goddamn terrorists .
now they' ve joined the media .
why didn' t you tell me sooner ?
i' m a reporter .
i was hoping for a scoop .
don' t be an idiot , robinson .
these people will eat you for breakfast .
if they contact you again ... please , let me know .
day or night .
consider me ...
a friend ?
i was going to say " ally .
mr. robinson ?
i' m sorry .
miss markham told me to give this to you .
she wanted me to hand it to you directly .
she sounded very mysterious .
what is it ?
the police report on agustin' s death .
who' s winning ?
would you get me another drink , please ?
this is for vlps only .
how did you get in here ?
the security guard was female .
she was susceptible to my charm .
big fan , huh ?
he' s going to foul .
yeah .
this fax .
one could draw some startling conclusions .
the forward centre is a star .
the police reports agustin' s suicide ...
at five minutes to 1 1 : 00 in the morning ...
you' re ruining my game . ... after mcgovern and i spoke .
mcgovern knew about this .
our boss is involved in this .
agustin never stood a chance .
i' m glad you' re in this with me .
no , you can count me out .
these guys , they don' t blush at much .
you scared ?
if you were going to sit it out , why did you bait me ?
you were hungry , out to get a name .
here' s a story , now go fetch it .
so , i get my head blown off , and you sit behind your desk ?
hank , when you' ve seen what i' ve seen , and you' ve lived what i' ve lived ... then you can judge me .
if i can help without exposing myself , i will .
but i don' t intend on destroying myself over this .
it' s not big enough .
see you at the water cooler , nicola .
hello , mr. robinson .
lmagine running into you here .
relax .
perhaps we
yeah , but the only problem was he didn' t understand a word i was saying .
quite  so , what' s the joke ?
hank , good to see you .
nice to see you .
tell us what our star reporter has been up to .
what have i been up to ?
well , i was shot , chased , nearly killed .
all in a day' s work , you know .
how about you ?
murder any competitors lately ?
hank , why don' t i get you a drink ?
enjoy yourselves .
you' ve been reading too many spy novels , hank .
how did you know what was in agustin' s police report before it was issued ?
i have an amazingly good contact in the barcelona police force .
who ?
hank !
a good reporter never reveals his sources .
you' re lying .
am i ?
truth is in the eye of the beholder .
truth is power .
the anarchist attack on nova .
orchestrated to remove an obstacle ... that stubborn old fool , sert ... and put manuel pla in charge .
framing agustin ?
another obstacle removed .
now , pla has his finger in the internet and telecommunications pie .
why are you doing this ?
the internet is dangerous .
it allows people to get information they cannot be trusted with .
it must be controlled ... step by step .
until , eventually , people like you are running the whole show .
i' m wondering what the chief magistrate is going to think about this .
why don' t we ask him ?
he' s one of my guests .
he' s right down there , see ?
i believe you' ve already made his acquaintance .
of course , we will have to tell him the truth , the whole truth , and nothing but the truth ... including your pilfering of the aribau story .
oh , yes , i knew all along .
that' s why i hired you .
well , we' re the same , you and i.
unbound by petty moral concepts of good and evil ... we see what has to be done , and we do it .
men like us rule the world .
no .
yes .
we are governed only by our desires .
me , it' s power .
for you , i' d say respect .
look , the crime is not stealing the story , son .
the crime is getting caught .
so , why don' t we join the party ?
there are some people i' d really like you to meet .
they , too , have done what it takes .
triumph over adversity .
i' m a whore .
mr. robinson , you have a call on line 1 .
thank you .
robinson .
it' s me .
we cleaned up the tracking .
god , hank .
it' s horrible .
all right .
play it .
stop it !
it' s enough !
what ?
did you have to make such a scene ?
aribau filmed the whole thing , right ?
nobody will suspect me .
he saw what we wanted him to see .
oh , jesus .
these people are savages .
we have to broadcast this , hank .
oh , god .
all right , don' t do anything yet .
just give me a little time , all right ?
okay .
important call ?
don' t you knock ?
so what' s the plan ?
the plan ?
well , i thought i' d finish my puff piece on manuel pla ... go down to the local watering hole , get shit faced , and try and get laid .
yesterday , you were going to change the world .
well , i thought better that .
so you' re going to do nothing ?
you' re the one that wanted to leave it alone .
so it' s people like you and me that help mcgovern get away with murder .
listen to hank , jr . !
you and your daddy are cut from the same cloth .
let' s leave my father out of it .
no , i don' t think so .
it must have been tough growing up in the great man' s shadow .
but let me cut him down to size for you .
howard robinson covers the islamic revolution ... that topples the shah of iran .
he backs it up with eyewitness accounts of atrocities and mass murders .
truth is , he spent most of his days in the tehran hilton , shagging me .
bullshit .
his stories were ripped off from local persian journalists ... most of whom , i might add , did not survive the ayatollah' s purges .
no witness , no one to expose him .
what , nothing to say ?
hank , look on the bright side .
he would' ve been so proud of you .
no , with all due respect , i think you' re wrong .
no , you should lead with this , then pick this up later .
it is much stronger , believe me .
yes , okay .
our report on seor pla .
fair and balanced , i hope .
just like you asked for .
good lad .
you know , nicola , i think our hank is beginning to tire of barcelona .
perhaps we should find a more interesting spot for him .
baghdad , say , or kabul ?
i' m so sorry , archie .
no , it' s my fault .
really .
i' m such a klutz !
it' s all right .
no problem .
sorry .
thank you very much .
you' re welcome .
you two need a coffee break .
now .
just wanted to let you know that we' re going to do a story on you .
one i think you' il be rather pleased with .
well , let me see .
computer genius ... " and internet pioneer .
wait .
legendary entrepreneur .
when we are finished , the whole world will want to get into bed with you .
the sky is the limit .
robinson is a good dog .
he' il fetch and do as he' s told .
besides , it would be rather unfortunate to have to ... put down another journalist .
nicola !
my turn to run into you .
any special plans tonight ?
those are top secret .
is it chanel you' re wearing ?
archie !
who' s the lucky man ?
i' il never tell .
do i know him ?
you' il never get away with this , you know .
dating fellow employees is against company regulations .
okay , i' il quit .
look , let me give you a ride .
no , thanks , archie .
you' re not going my way .
bye .
goodbye .
i' m so sorry , archie .
nicola , you sneaky little devil .
nicola !
i had the story in my hands .
all right .
i loved your father .
i' il nail them to a wall .
i swear to you .
what are you waiting for ?
impress me .
brechner .
listen , they killed her , okay ?
nicola .
they killed nicola .
meet me at 7tv , all right ?
we end this now .
robinson !
hank , what happened ?
don' t ask .
listen , is the tape set ?
yes , we can broadcast ...
from the studio right now .
okay .
brechner .
go round back .
make sure the rats don' t escape .
i' m calling the cops .
hello .
hey , how are you doing ?
brechner .
no , no , no .
call me crusader .
yeah , that' s it .
he' s on his cell phone .
keep him talking .
if i can find his frequency , we can broadcast it from the studio .
listen , maybe we can cut a deal .
all right ?
i' m afraid not , pal .
you' re not working out as we had hoped .
your resignation is required .
i even convinced mcgovern to recruit you .
i' ve got his frequency .
i followed you for a week after the nova incident .
you never showed any sign of remorse , not once .
i said , " this is our guy !
i even cleaned up after you .
remember joaquim ?
a few drops of hydrochloric acid in a glass of beer ... problem solved , if you know what i mean .
nicola ?
an injection .
straight to the aorta .
melts away the protective cardiac tissue .
looks just like a heart attack , don' t you think ?
very clean .
hey , that' s my set .
hank , i had help .
you helped me .
they are all dead because of you .
you endangered their lives just so you could get one step closer .
to what , hank ?
the top ?
greed .
so ugly , isn' t it , hank ?
i may have done the deed , but you sure made it easy .
listen to me , you son of a bitch !
now , now , now , hank !
you should be thanking me .
you' re not dead .
the only reason you' re still alive is because ...
i' ve allowed you to .
why don' t you go to hell ?
maybe i will .
but after you , my friend .
and hank , when you get there ... say hi to carlos aribau .
hello .
i don' t think so .
you know , this is the second time i' ve had to hold a gun to your head .
you remember .
i think i' ve let you live long enough .
god damn it !
this is so sweet .
interpol .
everything is all right .
what ?
good thing your friend pedro called the police ... when he saw your impromptu broadcast .
we' ve been tracking these two for months .
so he was using your identity as a cover , and you' ve been ...
following me to get to him .
well , i' m sorry .
excuse me .
i got to go .
yeah .
are you all right ?
yeah .
i' ve been better .
i' m sorry .
the tape will destroy pla .
it' s finally over .
not quite .
did you have to make such a scene ?
aribau filmed the whole thing , right ?
nobody will suspect me .
he saw what we wanted him to see .
the evidence of the released videotape led to the immediate arrest of manuel pla .
the damning video was shot by ... journalist carlos aribau and his cameraman .
i stole it .
i apologise to them ... and to you .
as journalists , we have all taken a sacred oath ... to report nothing but the truth .
but sometimes ... in the mad race for glory and ratings ... we forget our promise .
it' s then your duty to remind us ... to keep us vigilant , to keep us honest ... to keep us fair .
because in the end ... you get the press you deserve .
this is hank robinson for vision tv ... signing off .
what are you all staring at ?
get back to work !
what the hell do you think you' ve done ?
by ruining me , you' ve only achieved your own destruction , son .
i' m not your son , i have a father , you piece of shit .
don' t  temper , mcgovern .
you don' t want us to add assault to the other charges .
not that it would make much difference .
take care , mr. robinson .
thank you .
hey , marisa .
that motto from your class .
what was it ?
believe nothing of what you hear and only half of what you see .
words to the wise .
that' s for you .
thank you .
mr. robinson .
yeah ?
can i get my old job back ?
i' il think about it .
