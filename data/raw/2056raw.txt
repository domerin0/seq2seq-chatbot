a little piece of poland a little piece of france

a little slice of turkey and all that that entails
und then a piece of england scotland lreland and wales
nobody' s allowed here during a performance !
a little nip of norway a little spot of greece
a little hunk of hungary oh what a lovely feast
a little bite of belgium and now for some dessert
armenia albania and russia wouldn ' t hurt
we' re from the foreign office .
we must see bronski .
i' m sorry , sir , but you can' t .
he' s on stage .
a little piece of poland a little piece of france
a little piece of lndia and pakistan perchance
why did it come down ?
i' ve never been so outraged .
don' t look at us !
sondheim !
who brought the curtain down ?
i was ordered to .
ordered to !
by whom ?
by me .
who are you ?
dr. boyarski .
these are my colleagues .
wonderful .
what gives you the right to stop my show ?
we are trying to stop a war .
what' s that got to do with comedy ?
your presentation could be construed as an insult to hitler .
it was meant to be an insult !
lupinski , shut up !
we cannot allow you to ridicule the third reich .
it' s too risky .
let me tell you something .
the curtain' s going up . . . . . . and we' re gonna finish .
we are not backing down !
then we' re closing this theatre .
we' re backing down .
strike the sets .
thank you , mr. bronski .
let' s get on with the next number .
the next number isn' t ready yet !
we' il use klotski' s klowns .
sondheim !
send in the clowns !
klotski , get ready !
you' re going on !
we' re still 1 0 minutes short .
what' il we do ?
pardon me , a thought .
shakespeare .
i could do my shylock .
shakespeare .
great idea , lupinski .
one little change .
you don' t do shylock .
i do hamlet .
hamlet ?
what a wonderful idea .
i heard that .
oy , the comedian gets to play hamlet .
and me , a serious actor , gets to play the first off stage nazi .
he did everything .
oh , good !
mutki , mama' s baby !
" naughty nazis " is out ?
foreign office says it' s offensive .
what' s gonna take its place ?
bronski' s gonna do his hamlet .
and that' s not offensive ?
offensive , yes .
but convenient .
what do you mean ?
while he' s busy with his soliloquy . . . . . . our gorgeous young flier could wing his way backstage .
are you suggesting i have a rendezvous with lieutenant what' s his name . . . . . . while my husband' s out on stage ?
yes .
all right .
but remember , you said it .
ladies and gentlemen .
there has been a change in the program .
tonight you will be honored by frederick bronski' s world famous . . . . . .
highlights from hamlet .
yes .
is not more ugly to the thing that helps it . . . . . . than is my deed to my most painted word .
o heavy burthen !
i hear the handsome young prince coming .
let us withdraw , my lord .
to be . . .
or not to be .
. . . or not to be .
excuse me .
that . . .
pardon me . . . . is the que  excuse me . que . . . question .
pardon me .
whether ' tis nobler in the mind . . .
excuse me . . . . to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune .
pardon me .
or to take arms against a sea of troubles . . . . . . and by opposing , end them ?
what happened ?
he' s good tonight .
i can' t believe it .
i' m actually sitting here with you .
you' re anna bronski .
yes , i am .
you' re the one who' s been sending flowers .
they' re expensive .
you shouldn' t .
it' s okay .
my father' s a florist .
and that must be mutki .
hello , mutki .
oh , you know his name .
i know everything about you .
i' ve read every word written on anna bronski .
how' s kishka ?

kishka , your canary .
oh , kishka , my canary .

i' m sorry to hear that .
i love that picture of you on the farm .
you behind the plow .
by the way , where was that ?
in the chronicle .
no , where' s the farm ?
oh , the farm !
that' s out of town somewhere .
that' s where they keep them .
oh , but that' s enough talk about me .
let' s talk about you .
how' d you like me in the first act ?
i thought you were sensational .
oh !
flatterer .
i bet you have girls chasing you .
no , i don' t .
you chase them ?
well , actually , i believe that you really only fall in love once .
and when you do , you should dedicate your whole life to that person .
yes , i totally agree .
but on the other hand . . . . . . i' ve always felt that love should never stand in the way of a good time .
how about you ?
i do like to have fun .
you do ?
what do you do for fun ?
i fly a bomber .
that' s fun ?
yes !
there' s nothing like it .
i climb into the cockpit , the engines start to rev up , i' m in another world .
they sputter .
they hum .
then they thunder .
the plane moves forward , taxiing down the runway slowly .
faster , till the world becomes a blur , rushing by at incredible speed .
my tail starts to rise .
the roar of the engines becomes deafening .
the plane shakes , pushing with all its might to break free .
then i' m off the ground !
thrusting upward , upward into the sky .
flying higher and higher until i feel i can touch the sun .
would you like to see my bomber ?
yes !
forgive me .
i got carried away .
you' re not the only one .
it' s getting late in denmark .
you must go .
i have to change .
when can i see you again ?
oh , dear , i don' t know .
i don' t know .
he' s doing hamlet tomorrow night .
how about tomorrow night ?
great !
great !
same time ?
i don' t know .
all right .
mrs. bronski .
anna , may l . . . ?
yes ?
yes ?
may i kiss you good night ?
of course .
gee , thanks a lot .
oh , he' s an animal !
listen , honey
are you all right ?
i' m fine .
then why are you on the floor ?
the floor ?
i' m on the floor ?
get me up .
i still can' t believe what happened last night .
i can' t believe it .
bronski , will you please stop ? !
gets up and walks right out .
did it happen before ?
no .
all right .
it happened last night , it' il never happen again .
o heavy burthen !
i hear the handsome young prince coming .
let us withdraw , my lord .
to be . . .
. . . or not to be .
that is the question .
excuse me .
whether ' tis no
no . . . .
excuse me .
pardon me .
no ! bler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows . . . . . . of outrageous fortune .
or to take arms against a sea of . . . .
a sea of . . . .
a sea of . . .
troubles !
ow ! . . . troubles . . . .
enter andre sobinski .
exit sasha kinski .
won' t you sit down , lieutenant ?
there isn' t time .
what ?
mrs. bronski .
anna , my squadron has been put on alert .
i' ve done something that i hope you won' t think is too bold .
i' m sure it isn' t .
good .
i' ve written a letter to your husband , telling him how we feel .
you what ?
it' s the decent and honorable thing .
and a stupid thing .
you' re right .
that is stupid .
i' m glad you changed your mind .
i should' ve followed my first instinct .
what was that ?
to be a man .
to tell him in person .
andre , let' s think this out .
if we tell him now , all we' il do is hurt him .
i know what you' re feeling and what i' m feeling .
if those feelings grow , if they get deeper . . . . . . and we find ourselves hopelessly in love . . . . . . then we' il hurt him .
i' il tell him now .
listen to me .
anna , it' s war .
war ?
let me see that .
german troops crossed the polish border at several points today .
i' ve gotta get back to my squadron .
people are gonna kill each other .
andre .
goodbye , anna .
andre , come back .
don' t worry , i will .
i have to see you again .
goodbye .
goodbye .
that poor boy .
all of them .
anna , have you heard ?
it seems impossible , doesn' t it ?
does the audience know ?
no .
let' s make an announcement .
stabbed in the back .
i don' t believe it .
i don' t believe it .
i know , i know .
isn' t it terrible ?
terrible ?
it' s more than terrible .
it' s the worst thing that' s ever happened .
it' s the end .
no .
it isn' t .
it just mustn' t be .
that man , i hate him !
i hate him too .
everybody hates him .
all europe hates him .
they should .
i mean , two nights in a row !
two nights in a row ?
what are you talking about ?
he walked out on me again !
bronski , bronski !
can' t you forget about you for one minute ?
my god , war .
what' s happening ?
what' s going on ?
we' ve been invaded .
this could be the end of poland .
this is bad too .
air raid !
mutki .
everybody to the cellar !
to the cellar !
a bomb !
ka boom .
oy , oy , oy !
what' s going on ?
all right .
don' t panic .
you' il get your costume .
it' s war !
the germans are bombing us .
hurry up .
come on .
hurry up !
is everybody here ?
what did we do to them ?
nothing .
we don' t have to do anything .
poland , the doormat of europe .
everybody steps on us .
if it isn' t the russians , it' s the germans .
listen .
i wish we could do something .
what can we do ?
we' il do what a theatrical company should do .
we' il hide till it' s over .
warsaw is almost leveled as the luftwaffe relentlessly pounds ... ... the polish capital into rubble .
a stunned poland unprepared for the mighty german war machine ... ... is brought to its knees in less than three weeks .
poland surrenders but the fiight is carried on from england ... ... by the polish squadron of the r. a. f.
forgive me , but just hearing that song took me back to warsaw .
my regret is that i' m too old to do the splendid things . . . . . . that you brave young men do for poland .
professor siletski , your radio speeches on the voice of free poland ... . . . are worth a thousand bombs .
thank you , but i won' t be doing them again for a while .
why is that ?
you see , i' m leaving for
i' m going on a little trip .
where to , professor ?
thank you for the fine supper and wonderful songs .
it' s a secret mission .
please .
you' re going to poland , aren' t you ?
are you going to krakw ?
i can' t tell you any more .
i shouldn' t have mentioned it .
you didn' t .
we coerced you .
my wife' s in krakw .
if you could
i understand , but i cannot jeopardize the purpose of my trip .
not one of us would mention a word
all right .
if i can' t trust you , whom can i trust ?
write down the names and addresses of your people and i' il do what i can .
my family got out of poland , but there' s someone still in warsaw .
can you handle a delicate matter ?
is there a lady involved ?
exactly .
you want to contact her ?
without her husband knowing .
that is delicate .
what is the message ?
just say , " to be or not to be . " she' il understand .
in code ?
and the lady' s name is mrs. . . ?
believe it or not , it' s anna bronski .
let me write all that down .
to be or not to be .
what did you say the lady' s name was ?
anna bronski .
b r o n s k i , is that correct ?
you' ve never heard of anna bronski ?
should i have ?
you said you lived in warsaw .
oh , yes , yes , the name is familiar .
familiar ?
she' s famous !
oh , that anna bronski !
what was i thinking ?
of course .
can you read this ?
my brother' s with the underground .
with the underground ?
brave .
my cousin' s in the underground .
what' s his name ?
nobody from warsaw could not know anna bronski .
something is wrong , and i thought it was my duty to inform you .
siletski already left .
he' s due in sweden .
how' d you know he was leaving ?
he told us he was going to warsaw .
he told you ?
that' s why we gave him the names and addresses .
what ?
of whom ?
people in the underground .
he wrote them down ?
yes , sir .
if he isn' t stopped , we' ve sentenced the polish underground to death .
how is he getting to warsaw ?
by boat , then by train .
lieutenant , how long would it take you to fly to warsaw ?
seven hours .
it' s imperative that list never falls into the gestapo' s hands .
take this .
find him and kill him .
i will , sir .
coming up on the jump site , sir .
good luck .
now !
three hundred years to build a city and in three weeks they wreck it .
heil hitler .
where' s bronski ?
at the german censorship board . . . . . . trying to convince them shakespeare wasn' t jewish .
shakespeare wasn' t jewish ?
go figure .
hold it , gruba .
he' s coming .
whoa !
thanks , dobish .
mr. bronski , i could talk to you ?
what is it ?
who' s this ?
my cousin , rifka .
she was bombed out .
she' s a jew .
she has nowhere to go .
could i keep her downstairs with me ?
all right .
keep it quiet .
thank you , mr. bronski .
who are they ?
you expect her to leave a husband and son behind ?
you crazy ?
i must be .
all right , go inside .
thank you , mr. bronski .
thank you .
mr. bronski , i' ve got a notice for you from the gestapo .
the gestapo ?
yeah .

but they are not , i repeat , not taking my house .
never !
got everything ?

everything they' re allowing us to take .
good .
excuse me .
you' re sitting in col. erhardt' s chair .

i' m going out .
what the hell' s that pink thing ?
haven' t you heard ?
the latest fashion in occupied poland .
jews wear yellow stars .
homosexuals wear pink triangles .
oh , sasha !
how awful for you .
i hate it .
it clashes with everything .
they' re rounding up jews .
are they ?
no , not yet .
so far , so good .
when are you coming back ?
don' t wait up .
i' ve got a date . . . . . . with another triangle .

is your little belly hungry ?
sweetheart , come .
here we go .
andre !

anna .
how did you get here ?

i didn' t .
oh .
i was sent by british lntelligence .
british lntelligence ?
i' ve got to stop a dangerous man .
who ?
what ?
his name is professor siletski .
on radio ?
the voice of free poland ?
he is a traitor .
a german agent .
he' s coming with a list of everyone in the polish underground .
if he reaches the gestapo , every person on that list will die .
where is he ?
he arrives by train tomorrow morning .
how are you gonna stop him ?
i don' t know .
right now , i can' t think .
i' m exhausted .
you must get some rest .
i didn' t mean to get you involved .
i had nowhere to go .
german patrols are everywhere .
can i sleep on your sofa ?
no .
what ?
you take the bed .
what about your husband ?
he' il take the sofa .

good evening , mrs. bronski .
i am professor siletski .
siletski ?
is something wrong ?
no .
i' m curious to know why i was brought here .
i' il come to the point .
i' m going to read something to you .
i want you to tell me what it means .
" to be or no to be . " hamlet .
act 3 , scene 1 .
is this a theatre quiz ?
not quite .
this message was sent to you from england .
we thought it might have another , more secret meaning .
more secret ?
oh , more secret meaning .
yes , a more secret meaning .
yes , it does .
it does .
it means , and i hope it won' t go any further than this room
you see , my husband is that great polish actor , frederick bronski .
who ?
he' s world famous in poland .
his favorite soliloquy is , " to be or not to be .
he takes 1 0 minutes to get through it .
i thought that might be a good time to invite this young flier backstage .
just to chat , nothing more .
well , he turned out to be quite intelligent and humorous and . . . . . . tall .
well , i begin to understand .
this is just a secret love code between you and your young lieutenant .
well . . . .
well , i am relieved .
i apologize for having brought you here .
you see
forgive me .
siletski .
hello , colonel erhardt .
absolutely .
thanks for sending the plane to sweden .

yes .
i am looking forward to meeting you too .
heil hitler .
i won' t keep you any longer .
thank you for , " to be or not to be .
wait .
it seems i have the night off .
why don' t you stay and have dinner with me ?
we representatives of the third reich can be quite charming on occasion . . . . . . if given half a chance .
perhaps i could convince you to join our cause .
i' d love to have dinner with you , professor .
but just as you' d like to present germany in the best light . . . . . . i' d like to plead the polish case dressed in something more special .
of course .
hurry back .
may l ?
you' re drooling .
thank you .
this lady is permitted to leave .
this is a difficult place to get into , but even more difficult to get out of .
au revoir .
i kiss your hand . . .
. . . for now .
sweetheart , sweetheart , sweetheart .
so many hours with those nazi censors !
and there' s some more bad news .
they want us to cut out the gypsy number .
it seems they don' t like gypsies either .
let' s face it , sweetheart . . . . . . without jews , fags and gypsies , there is no theatre .
i know , i know .
that' s what i told them .
but there' s nothing , nothing they' re gonna do about it .
i' m so tired .
so tired .
sweetheart , i' m so tired .
you feel good .
when this war' s over , i' m gonna get you everything you need .
you need a coat .
you need a dress .
you need shoes .
and you need a shave .
a shave ?
to be or not to be .

i heard him talking with erhardt , the head of the gestapo .
siletski has that list .
he' il take it to the gestapo tomorrow , or tonight .
what are you talking about ?
what do i do ?
keep siletski there .
he mustn' t get to erhardt with the list .
if he' s dangerous , why send her back ?
somebody' s got to stop him .
wait a minute .
siletski and erhardt haven' t met .
if we find someone to play erhardt . . . .
a good actor .
a great actor .
a dead actor .
don' t look at me .
don' t look at me .
look at me !
i' il never get away with this .
who' d believe i' m erhardt ?
that this is gestapo headquarters ?
the flags !
give me hitler .
relax .
siletski' s never met erhardt .
he doesn' t know what he looks like .
if we all play our parts properly , he' il never suspect a thing .
me my moe !
dobish !
let' s rehearse the scene .
all right .
heil hitler .
heil hitler .
all right , i' ve got it .
it took longer than i thought .
i hope the effect was worth it .
it was definitely worth it .
i would die for the fhrer any time , except for the next few hours .
come , my dear .
shall we go ?
go ?
where ?
what ?
i' ve booked a table at ladow' s .
it' s getting late .
the gestapo won' t be calling anymore tonight .
ladow' s .
what a lovely surprise .
oh , a piano !
i haven' t seen one in ages .
and with keys !
and it works .

i' m afraid we' re running
you and the night and the music
fill me with flaming desire
setting my being completely
on fire
the flags .
don' t forget the flags !
hurry up .
we' re late .
you drive like an understudy .
i won' t take that from you .
will you stop ?
how long can anna keep him there ?
sweetheart sweetheart
sweetheart
heart and soul i fell in love with you heart and soul
the way a fool would do madly
because you held me tight and stole a kiss in the night
darling , your little recital is over .
time to go .
but i wasn' t finished .
yes , you were .
are we mad ?
are we insane ?
what are we doing ?
we' re going out to a noisy restaurant . . . . . . when we could dine here , in this beautiful hotel suite .
professor siletski' s room .
206 .
who may i announce ?
we will announce ourselves .
button your collar .
yes , sir .
why don' t we call room service ?
this is german military headquarters .
there is no room service .
then why don' t we just skip dinner ?
yes .

the gestapo knows everything .

good company ?
hasn' t she got a husband ?
isn' t she married to that famous actor frederick bronski ?
you' ve seen him ?
no .
oh .
what does that matter ?
she not only has a husband , she has a lover .
she does ?
yes , a certain lt. sobinski .
they have a secret love code .
whenever her silly husband was on stage emoting , " to be or not to be " . . . . . . that was the signal for their backstage rendezvous .
i knew it !
we at the gestapo know everything .
so they call me " concentration camp " erhardt ?
back to mrs. bronski .
why don' t we forget her ?
yes , why don' t we ?
she' s just a cheap , common , promiscuous little
i think i know what you mean .
i know , mr. bronski .
now , up with your hands .
i don' t know if you ever played a corpse . . . . . . but you' il be one unless you do as i say .
tell your friends at the door to clear away from there .
i won' t do it .
get up against that wall .
you' re a pole .
how do you live with yourself ?
turn around !

i wanna see it coming .
i don' t have to see it coming .

what did you do with siletski' s body ?
never mind siletski' s body .
what did you do with sobinski' s body ?
how can you ask that at a time like this ?
schultz is ready to take you to erhardt , who' s head of the gestapo .
the gestapo , i forgot .
i don' t think i can do it .
i can' t get away with it .

a story about our fhrer .
how does it go ?
oh , yes , they named a brandy after napoleon .
they made a herring out of bismarck .
and hitler will end up as a pickle .
a pickle ?
yes , because he is such a sourpuss .
that' s not funny .
the fhrer won' t find it funny .
do you think it' s funny ?
no !
i hate it .
please , professor .

yes , the underground movement .
well , let' s get down to details .

that make my life complete
and at the top you' il fiind the thing
that makes my poor heart beat
it isn ' t money or power or a castle rising in spain
it' s a simple word that you' ve often heard
but let me repeat it again
that word is " iadies
those wonderful ladies
those fabulous ladies
they' re driving me wild
i' m talkin ' ladies
all ages of ladies
from 20s to 80s
they' ve got me beguiled
out of the way .
i love those ladies
those glamorous ladies
over amorous ladies
they' re simply divine
i don ' t care if i' m headed for heaven or headed for ... ... hades
as long as there' s ladies
oh ladies be mine
i told you there was no one in there .
you invade poland , warsaw , and now my dressing room .
you people are compulsive invaders .
he loves the ladies they smell ofperfume
those wonderful ladies they light up a room
those fabulous ladies soft and sweet as a rose
they' re driving him wild in or out of their clothes
i' m talkin ' ladies
i certainly am those heartbreaking ladies
those breathtaking ladies
they' ve got me beguiled
he calls us ladies but there' s one that' s the best
his glamorous ladies stands out from the rest
over amorous ladies here' s the one that i mean
she' s a princess no no she' s a queen
so ... ... although the lucilles and the sallys and susies and ... ... sadies
may be beautiful ladies
this lady' s my queen
what are you doing ?
help me , they' re after me .

that' s all i can say .
chief of police keeps me waiting an hour and a half .
then comes in and says , " nobody knows where they' re holding sasha .
i used to command respect to this city
what' s that ?
the gestapo arrested anna .
she' s at erhardt' s office .
my god !
i' ve got to get her out .

i' m taking advantage of the fact that we have a mutual friend .
siletski .
in that case i' m puzzled , colonel erhardt .
why am i under arrest ?
arrest ?
get out .
no , i brought you here because i have some wonderful news for you .
tonight , you and your theatre company will perform for the fhrer .
he' s paying a surprise visit to warsaw .
what a great honor .
we really don' t deserve it .
besides , we can' t do it .
you can' t ?
no .
our theatre' s been closed .
it' s boarded up .
who closed it ?
the gestapo .
excuse me .
schultz !
what idiot gave the order to close the bronski theatre ?
you did , sir .
open it up immediately .
and stop blaming everything that goes wrong on me !
but , colonel , i was only obeying all i was doing heil hitler .
heil hitler !
he gets out of everything with that heil hitler .
mrs. bronski , i had the pleasure of seeing you on the stage once .
you' re even more beautiful in person .
would it be too forward of me . . . . . . to propose a champagne supper after the performance this evening ?
i' d love to .
but i' m already having a candlelight dinner with siletski .
any chance we could have supper after dinner ?
i' m sorry .
i never sup after i dine .
oh .
i don' t want to take advantage of our new friendship .
but when they closed our theatre , they arrested my dresser .
since i' m going to perform tonight , do you think he could be released ?
what is his name ?
sasha kinski .
sasha kinski ?
yes .
he' s being held downstairs .
he' s set for transfer tomorrow .
what does that mean ?
you better find a new dresser .
excuse me .
what ? !
murdered ?
you sure it is his body ?
positive identification .
this is terrible .
terrible !
mrs. bronski , please .
sit down .
i' m afraid l i' m afraid i have very bad news for you .
your friend , our friend , siletski , has been killed .
he' s dead .
his body was found in a trunk .
well . . . .
i guess you' re free for dinner tonight .
it' s a bit of a shock .
i' m still a little upset .
naturally , naturally .
forgive me .
this is an emergency .
siletski' s on the phone .
good .
what ?
professor siletski ?
did you tell him he was dead ?
no .
good .
hello , professor siletski .
it' s good to hear your voice .
how are you ?
how are you feeling ?
he' s alive ?
no , he' s still dead .
this is obviously an imposter .
i can see you in 20 minutes .
is that good for you , professor siletski ?
fine .
we' il be waiting for you .
i must run , there' s so much to do .
i' m so sorry .

oh , god , you' re right .
i' m gonna take a spare .
you never know .
just in case .
sobinski , look .
if something goes wrong . . . . . . i don' t blame you for falling in love with her .
it' s easy .
good luck .
no !
don' t say that , it' s bad luck .
what do you say to say good luck ?
you say , " break a leg .
break a leg !

thank you , thank you .
goodbye .
professor siletski .
heil hitler !
heil hitler .
how' s the professor ?
fine .
how' s the colonel ?
excellent .
pity you didn' t get here sooner .
you just missed madam bronski .
she' s gone ?
she went to the theatre .
they' re doing a show for your friend , the fhrer .
oh !
i' il be going too .
would you wait in my office ?
i have a few matters to take up with these men .
then we' il get to you .
if it' s not too much trouble .
no , no trouble at all .
no , no trouble .
no trouble .
no trouble .
trouble .
don' t move .
i' il be right back .
good .
he should' ve cracked by now .
patience !
give him time to think .
this is the intellectual approach .
what if he isn' t an intellectual ?
they' il break every bone in his body .
excuse me .
i tried to open a conversation with your friend .
he seems to be slightly dead .
no !
really ?
let' s go and see .
you' re very observant , professor .
he is dead .
have you observed he looks a little bit like you ?
he' s a dead ringer for me .
or versa vice a .
obviously , one of us is an imposter .
obviously .
it looks bad for me .
doesn' t look good .
did you know him ?
never met him .
you must have observed him for months .
it takes that long to grow a beard .
good !
yes , schultz .
i might be wearing a false beard .
very funny .
a clever agent like you wearing a false beard .
maybe he' s wearing a false beard .
why don' t you convince yourself ?
why don' t you pull his beard ?
all right , i will .
i can' t do it .
too sensitive ?
you can murder a man in cold blood , but you can' t pull his beard ?
ah !
ooh , ooh , ooh . . . .
good work .
i can' t wait to see the fhrer' s face when i tell him .
schultz , you put me in this position !
you yourself gave the order .
shifting your responsibility again ?
all you ever do is shift !
but , colonel !
get out .
all of you .
professor . . . .
i don' t know how to apologize .
what can i do to make up for this ?
there is something .
yes , anything .
mrs. bronski is performing .
it would be wonderful to release her dresser .
impossible !
he' s scheduled for transport .
remember , i' m seeing the fhrer .
who knows what we' il talk about !
no schultz !
release the sissy .
which sissy ?
the one from the bronski theatre .
bring him here .
i knew it was you .
i had to satisfy the curiosity of those dummkopfs .
to put your mind at rest , would you like to pull my beard ?
please , professor .
don' t rub it in .
i' m sorry .
where is erhardt' s office ?
you can' t go in there .
arrest him !
wait !
silence !
i' m general von seidelman , head of the fhrer' s safety squad .
i arrived this morning and in one hour , i discover a plot against him .
can' t i rely on anybody ?
general
he' s an imposter .
shut up .
i will not .
are you blind ?
any fool can see he' s wearing a false beard .
you didn' t even pull on it .
what do you have to say ?
i
who is this ?
a prisoner .
i was going to release him in the imposter' s custody
i' il take charge myself .
there will be a reorganization here .
believe me , heads will roll .
you will hear from me .
you haven' t heard the last of this .
schultz !
remember , we' ve gotta be convincing .
the dress circle will be protected by hitler' s guard .
if they suspect anything , they' il shoot first and ask questions later .
be certain hitler' s in his box before the diversion .
and i am the diversion .
all your life you' ve wanted to play shylock .
please , be wonderful .
don' t worry , i can do it .
with a little luck , tomorrow night . . . . . . we' il all be in england .
me too ?
of course , you too .
and them ?
what them ?

what' s going on here ?
we started with three .

silence , jew .
let him speak .
hath not a jew eyes ?
hath not a jew hands ?
organs , dimensions , senses , affections , passions ?
fed with the same food .

if you poison us , do we not die ?
and if you wrong us . . . . . . shall we not revenge ?
silence !
