ring around the rosy
now , i' m trying to tell you ... that we can' t afford to keep you here anymore .
you already owe two months worth of back rent .
it' s mine , and you' re not taking it away .
read the will , nell .
the executor shall have the right to dispose of ... any and all personal property as he shall see fit .
he' s not even real family .
yeah , well , maybe not .
but clearly , mother thought lou would be much better equipped ... to deal with these unpleasant details than you .
unpleasant details " ?
what have i been dealing with for the past 11 years ?
i' ve cooked , cleaned , mopped up her urine !
you call that an " unpleasant detail " ?
hey , your sister didn' t write the will .
we all know what you' ve done .
we' re trying to help .
do not help me !
oh , ritchie .
just go sit on the couch , okay ?
oh .
anyway , once probate closes , we can put this apartment on the market , and we all might be able to make a few bucks .
also , we know how much you love mom' s car , so we' re giving it to you .
you' re taking away my home and giving me a 20 year old car ?
absolutely .
we' il deduct the value from the proceeds of the apartment .
who are you ?
do you understand that i have nowhere to go ?
we' ve been talking , and lou and i are very busy .
we could use someone to help us with the cleaning and the cooking ,
looking after ritchie ?
eleanor , help me .
i gotta pee .
ritchie , not now !
get outta my home .
well , suit yourself .
we' il let the courts handle it .
get out of my home .
honey , let go .
that' s right .
oops .
sorry .
okay .
here you go , honey .
follow daddy .
come live with us , nell .
you have no idea how hard it is out there .
no , jane .
you have no idea how hard it was in here .
hello .
yes , this is eleanor .
where ?
i see it .
research subjects .
nine hundred a week .
here' s how they' re organized .
the groups have very different personalities .
scored all over the kiersey temperament sorter , just like you asked for , and they all score very high on the insomnia charts .
oh , what a beautiful profile .
a classic dependent personality disorder .
however , we were looking for " suggestible .
her mother died two months ago .
she really wants to do this .
and what are your feelings , mary ?
tell me what your intuitions say .
i put my favorites on top .
mm hmm .
what else have we got here ?
low self esteem , high narcissism , chronic feeling of emptiness , identity disturbance .
good , good .
very good .
is this where we' re going ?
that' s hill house .
that' s perfect , isn' t it ?
the hill house project  is absolutely essential to my research , malcom .
no , just listen .
i grant you , fear and performance is a big , sexy idea .
but as chairman of this department , i cannot  i know you clinical guys ... don' t like to ask these questions , but think about it .
what is fear , anyway ?
it' s a series of automatic responses to a given stimulus , characterized by increased heart rate , respiratory activity and adrenaline function .
the only problem with fear is that it has largely become inappropriate and nonadaptive .
do sweaty palms help to talk to your boss ?
does a racing pulse help some kid' s score on an sat ?
and yet we carry with us these primordial fear responses ... that do the opposite of what they were intended to do .
so why is that ?
david , david , no one is saying ... that these aren' t provocative questions .
but you can' t conduct this research ethically or responsibly .
and on top of that , you' re bringing your insomniacs ... to this house under false pretenses .
because the experiment needs a credible cover story .
calling it an insomnia study ... allows me to create a highly suggestive environment ... to investigate the dynamics of fear .
you don' t tell the rats they' re actually in a maze , malcom .
come on .
what do you want ?
are are you mr. dudley , the caretaker ?
yeah .
i' m mr. dudley , the caretaker .
what are you doing here ?
i' m with dr. marrow' s group .
i' m supposed to see mrs. dudley .
is she here ?
what do you think ?
why do you need so many chains ?
that' s a good question .
what is it about fences ?
sometimes the people on either side of the fence see a locked chain , they feel a little more comfortable .
why do you suppose that is ?
mrs. dudley ?
hello ?
mrs. dudley ?
hello ?
hello ?
mrs. dudley ?
oh , my
i' m i' m , uh i' m eleanor vance .
i' m here with the  dr. marrow' s group .
you' re the first .
yeah , i' d i' d heard a sound , and that' s
it' s make the dinner or answer the door .
can' t do both .
are you mrs. dudley ?
so far .
i' il show you your room .
this way .
the red room .
you' re going to be the first visitors hill house has had ...
since mr. crain died .
really ?
these are beautiful .
i know .
i' ve seen ' em .
it' s a lot to dust .
i' ve never seen this kind of beauty .
you must love working here .
i set dinner on the dining room sideboard at six .
you can serve yourselves .
breakfast is ready at nine .
i don' t wait on people .
i don' t stay after dinner , not after it begins to get dark .
i leave ... before dark comes .
we live in town nine miles so there won' t be anyone around if you need help .
we couldn' t even hear you ... in the night .
why would we ?
no one could .
no one lives any nearer than town .
no one will come any nearer than that ... in the night , in the dark .
you' il be staying in the north wing .
hi .
don' t worry .
i' m not an obsessive packer .
it' s just asking people to help me schlepp this stuff is a cheap ... and exploitative way of making new friends .
here .
i' m theo .
hi .
eleanor , but everyone calls me nell .
well , everyone calls me nell , don' t you love it here ?
i love it .
sort of charles foster kane meets the munsters or something .
i like your boots .
you do ?
aren' t they great ?
prada .
milan , not new york .
but they' re killing me .
hey , small price to pay for such savage kicks .
wow .
oh , my god .
oh , this is so twisted .
seriously twisted .
i set dinner on the dining room sideboard at six .
breakfast is at nine .
i don' t stay after dinner , not after it begins to get dark .
i leave before dark comes , so there won' t be anyone here if you need help .
we couldn' t even hear you .
no one could .
no one lives any nearer than town .
no one will come any nearer than that .
in the night .
in the dark .
in the dark .
my bedroom' s right next door to yours .
i think we share the same bathroom .
oh , don' t worry .
i probably won' t be in here much .
light sleeper .
that' s why we' re here .
what do you do , eleanor ?
i' m between jobs right now .
the last person i was workin ' for , it ended .
over , so and you ?
well , that depends .
i' m supposed to be an artist , but i' ve been distracted from work by love .
you know what i mean ?
mmm , not really .
hey , don' t tell me boston' s different from new york .
oh , you mean you have trouble with commitment .
well , my boyfriend thinks so , my girlfriend doesn' t .
if we could all live together but they hate each other .
hello .
the bag .
you know , it' s hard when you' re the only one at the party .
you know what i mean ?
no .
a blank canvas .
i could paint your portrait directly on you .
or maybe not .
so , what about you ?
husbands ?
boyfriends ?
girlfriends , eleanor ?
where do you live ?
mmm .
i don' t have anyone .
but i do have a little apartment of my own .
it has a little flower garden .
you can just see the ocean .
and when the wind ... comes in just right , you can hear the buoys in the harbor .
wow .
that sounds really nice .
you' re lucky .
but you know that , right ?
oh , sorry .
just a little hair .
so , show me the bathroom !
oh , it' s really beautiful .
it is huge .
oh , my god !
this is the bathroom .
look at this bathtub .
can you believe it ?
look at that .
wow !
look at my bedroom , though .
isn' t it beautiful ?
yes .
you' ve got to see the great hall .
uh huh .
i mean , there' s so much carving .
it' s everywhere .
i know .
oh , look at this one .
isn' t this one great ?
no , that' s creepy .
oh , and this one .
this one' s weird .
well , you don' t get this from the martha stewart catalog .
i don' t like it .
isn' t it based on the gates of hell by rodin ?
well , it' s not just hell .
see , the children , they' re reaching for heaven , but their souls are trapped in purgatory .
and these are the demons ...
who can hold on to your soul for as long as they want .
did you study art ?
no , i studied purgatory .
i was there once for 11 years .
it' s when your soul is caught between the living and the dead .
oh , yeah , i' ve been there .
it' s an 18 hour flight from l. a. to paris , and you' re stuck in coach .
do you see ?
well , let' s not stand here .
come on .
okay .
whoa .
is it real ?
no .
shall we go in ?
yeah .
wow !
whoo !
wow !
wow !  [ humming ]  [ continues ]
it' s beautiful !
oh ! [ humming continues ]
would you care to dance ?
yes .
i' m starting to like this house !
this is great !
let' s get outta here .
god !
we' re like rats rats in a maze .
oh , god !
lf i ruin these boots
jesus , they cost me a fortune .
let' s go back .
it' s gotta be through here .
i' m sorry .
i' m sorry .
that' s all right .
oh .
hey , i' m sorry .
i didn' t mean to scare you .
i' m luke sanderson , just a bad sleeper .
basic tosser turner .
and you are ?
nell vance .
what kind of sleeper ?
nightmares ?
not really .
anxiety attacks ?
no .
uh uh .
okay .
obsessive indecision .
wow .
and you ?
let me think .
you , i' m gonna guess , are a
don' t even start .
wow , you' re so dominant .
thanks .
theo .
hey , theo .
jesus .
here we are .
hey .
you' re luke .
yup .
you' re theo .
you' re eleanor .
hi , i' m dr. marrow .
hi .
welcome .
hi .
hello , dr. marrow .
hi .
this is todd .
he' s just come up .
greetings , fellow insomniac .
mary lambetta , my assistant .
so how was your drive , eleanor ?
it was fine .
yeah .
good .
good .
welcome to hill house , everyone .
come on .
all right .
let the good times roll .
do you know what ?
the rest of you may hate your insomnia , but i' m not sure i want a cure for mine .
that' s when i get all my best ideas , when i' m waiting to fall asleep .
i' m alone , occasionally , with no distractions , my mind' s racing with creative ideas , and come 3 : 00 a . m . , i feel like a genius .
are you kidding me ?
3 : 00 a . m .
i start to feel ...
like i' m losing my mind , watching those infomercials on psychics ... or listening to tony robbins and the psychic hot lines .
have you ever seen that late night tv ?
oh , yeah .
thank you .
i swear to god .
you get a steady diet of that crap , and pretty soon you start thinking about movin ' to montana ...
and becomin ' a survivalist .
that' s why god created barbiturates , honey .
nembutal ?
mm mm .
no , todd , i think we have a classic seconal woman on our hands .
in fact , i think i see a little jackie susann in theo .
ow .
all right , you two .
enough about pharmaceuticals .
so , look , what do we all need in life ?
what are the basics ?
food , water , shelter .
sex .
and sleep .
sleep .
i' m working on a five year study , with the help of mary here , making profiles of bad sleepers .
i' m looking for a common psychological link .
i hope that the work we do here will someday be able to help other people like yourselves .
god knows i' m all for helping people , saving the world , but doesn' t everybody have a problem sleeping these days ?
life' s too frantic .
what about you , nell ?
um , well , it seems that you all have trouble sleeping , because your lives are exciting , and it' s complicated , and you think about it when you go to sleep .
but , um , i don' t know .
nothing' s ever really happened to me , so i don' t have a reason to sleep badly .
but in your application you said you had trouble sleeping .
mm hmm , yes , but it' s not like them .
it' s because , uh , there was always somebody calling me , there was always somebody banging .
ever since i was little , i took care of my mother .
and and she would wake up in the middle of the night .
she would bang with her cane on the wall .
and it was just this relentless it was a relentless banging all through the night .
that' s weird , because even though , uh , she' s dead ,
i still hear it and i wake up .
well , that' s why we' re here , eleanor to try and help you .
yeah , nell .
i think what dr. marrow' s trying to say is ... that you' re a basket case , just like the rest of us .
thank you , mary .
okay .
okay .
why are we here ?
what is wrong with you people ?
these are standard cognitive and perception tests .
i' il be giving you a variety of these during the course of the week .
you are not in competition , so do not worry about being the head of the class , okay ?
between all these tests , you' il have each other
todd and the house to keep you company .
luke .
eleanor .
but we can' t go to town .
no .
and as you were told , there' s no telephone service , there' s no tv .
and the caretakers tend to lock the gate when they leave .
however ,
i do have my trusty cell telephone , in case of emergencies , okay ?
and , um , what' s the deal with the adams family mansion ?
because , i gotta be honest ,
i don' t get a real strong sleep vibe from this place .
no .
me too .
i wanted to make sure you didn' t sleep too easily .
congratulations .
seriously , isolation is essential ... in the creation of an experimental model .
this house , who built it ?
who lived here ?
well , actually , that makes for a very good bedtime story .
once upon a time , there was a king who built a castle .
his name was hugh crain .
a hundred and thirty years ago , towns like concord and manchester were the center of american industry .
that' s where crain made a fortune on the backs of workers in his textile mills .
now , this man could have anything he wanted , but what he wanted more than anything ... was a house filled with the laughter of children .
that' s why there are all the carvings .
he married the most beautiful woman in town , called rene , and he built her this house , or at least some of it .
god , it sounds like a fairy tale or something .
but that' s where the fairy tale ends .
hugh and rene would have no children .
they all died at birth .
then , a few years later , rene , she passed away , and crain became a total recluse .
but he kept on building , adding room upon room .
it' s as if he was he was building a home for the family he would never have .
no one had seen crain for years .
but the townspeople said that sometimes at night ... they could hear sounds coming from the old house .
sounds of children .
so sad .
ooh !
jesus christ !
christ , i need a drink .
i think there' s more to that story .
i can feel it .
i it' s all around us .
it' s in the ceiling .
it' s in the walls .
it' s in the furniture .
it' s in this .
mary !
oh , jesus .
oh , no .
oh , jesus christ .
all right .
what happened ?
let me see .
oh , my god !
keep your hand away from it .
don' t touch it .
what were you doing ?
this' il stop the blood from getting into her eye .
mary , we' re going to get you to the hospital straightaway .
it' s gonna be all right .
it' s gonna be okay .
come on .
three steps .
please !
it' s all right .
it' s all right .
careful .
be careful .
here' s the gate key to get back in .
you have my cell number .
call me the second you' ve spoken to a doctor .
all right , dr. marrow .
hey , i want you guys back as soon as possible .
okay , mary ?
okay .
you' il be all right .
she almost lost her eye .
almost .
luke , there' s something about the house , about hugh crain that i didn' t say .
may i ask you not to tell the women ?
yeah , yeah .
it' s just i didn' t want the tests disturbed .
okay , sure .
hey , you guys , wait up .
okay .
you guys wanna hear something really scary ?
i just found this out .
turns out there' s a darker chapter to the hugh crain fairy tale .
remember his lovely wife , rene ?
well , rene , the town beauty , she didn' t just die .
she killed herself .
really ?
he just told you that ?
yes .
and you can' t say anything , ' cause he actually swore me to secrecy .
why did she kill herself ?
well , there are the stillborn children , although i like to think it was more sinister ,
like maybe hugh crain was a horrible monster and drove her to it .
monster ?
but he built this house for the woman that he loved ,
like the taj mahal .
the taj mahal wasn' t a palace .
it was a tomb .
and equally overdone .
why didn' t he tell us ?
maybe he doesn' t trust women .
yeah .
i think that' s probably it .
i think he knew that your fragile , delicate sensibilities
after all , you know , i' m a man .
i can handle this kind of [ chuckles ]
how' d she kill herself ?
he didn' t say .
oh , and ladies , sleep tight .
jesus .
after dinner and the first bland history of hill house successfully relayed ,
miss vance appears most susceptible to suggestive history , evincing a strongly sentimental reaction to the love story component .
mr. sanderson , who tested at the bottom of the mogel reliability scale , was given the second part of the story .
when he passes the story on , the experimental haunting fiction ... should manifest itself within the group .
and dear mary almost lost an eye .
i like the way you comb your hair like that .
here .
this is for you .
for me ?
yeah .
it' s beautiful .
no , i' il i' il do it .
it' s okay .
it' s okay .
mm hmm .
looks good on you .
mm hmm .
you' ve been out of the world a long time , haven' t you ?
yeah .
well , the world' s missed you .
happy tossing and turning .
eleanor .
now i lay me down to sleep .
i pray the lord my soul to keep .
if i should die before i wake ,
i pray the lord my soul to take .
god !
you scared the f  i' m sorry .
oh , you gotta be careful .
are you all right ?
i' m sorry .
oh , no , no , no .
you just don' t jump out
are you all right ?
uh , yeah .
n n no .
oh !
what' s with the , uh , glove ?
what ?
what' s with the glove ?
no , i couldn' t sleep .
i was just insomnia .
what' s with  ah , well [ mutters ]
yeah , you gotta be careful , ' cause l  i wasn' t .
i was just
no , i know .
i' m sorry .
i just
oh !
um , interesting group , huh ?
yeah , yeah , yeah .
it was good .
kind of i like theo .
she' s ... quite an insomniac .
well , uh , listen , you should try and get some sleep , huh ?
yeah , that' s a good idea .
all right .
okay .
see you tomorrow .
all right .
there' s some good hallways that way .
uh huh .
how' s this one ?
not bad .
good .
good .
see you tomorrow .
okay .
coming , mother .
i' m coming .
nell !
nell !
nell !
nell !
what is it ?
i don' t know .
where' s it coming from ?
it' s everywhere .
oh , my god .
what' s happening ?
can you feel it , nell ?
mm hmm .
the cold , can you feel it ?
nell , can you feel it ?
oh .
nell ?
it' s moving .
it' s over .
it' s over , right ?
nell , come back here .
come back here !
no , it' s in my room .
it' s in my room .
you guys all right ?
hey , is everything okay ?
oh , god .
it' s luke .
hey , is everything okay ?
you guys all right ?
luke !
oh , god .
what' s going on ?
did you hear it ?
yeah , i just heard it .
i  w w was it part of the experiment ?
was what part of the experiment ?
the noise !
what did you hear ?
theo , all i heard was you screaming ,
luke , help me , please .
i wasn' t screaming for you .
it was in my room , and then it went into nell' s room .
here , let me look .
are there any lights ?
yes .
i don' t i don' t see anything .
i don' t hear anything .
wow , i sort of got screwed on the old bedroom selection .
every room' s , like , four times as big as mine .
is that it ?
is that what you heard ?
well , i did just take a bath .
i mean , could' ve been .
yeah , but then how do you explain the breath and the cold ?
i don' t know .
a draft .
maybe someone left a window open somewhere .
the cold , who felt it first ?
oh , i think it was me .
what difference does it make ?
well , eleanor , if it was you , did you say theo ?
theo , if it was you , did you  look , i don' t need anyone to tell me i' m cold .
let' s blame it on the old plumbing then , huh ?
what else could it be ?
well , if you don' t need me anymore , i guess that' s it .
my job is done .
good night .
good night , luke .
yeah , me too .
yeah .
will you two be all right ?
yeah .
you really didn' t hear anything ?
no .
eleanor .
eleanor .
find us , eleanor .
oh , eleanor .
find us .
okay .
these carvings are really creepy .
all these fat little cherubs and angels with furry animals .
it' s really bizarre , i think .
i think they' re the children hugh crain built the house for .
i don' t buy that for a second that hugh crain was this lovable old tycoon ... with a soft spot for kids .
the guy was obviously running a sweatshop .
had children working 15 hours a day , and then he builds all this crap as propaganda .
it' s like those teletubbies .
those things freak me out also .
and they sing , so they' re actually even kind of scarier , if you think about it .
yeah .
how are you comin ' along ?
i can' t get this one .
what about you ?
i did all right .
but that' s another thing .
these tests .
it' s like , why do we have to be here ?
why do we have to be in this weird old house ?
i like this house .
i think it' s a beautiful house .
yeah , i guess .
i don' t know .
i just think dr. marrow' s up to something .
i' il tell you another thing .
i' m gonna get to the bottom of it , right after i check on theo , that is .
see how my old pal theo' s doing .
doing or wearing ?
yeah , no kidding .
did you see what she had on yesterday ?
wow .
yeah , i definitely got a soft spot for theo .
nell , i' m gonna shut this door and give you a little privacy .
if there' s anyone in there , we' il find him .
you just saw something move ?
i saw something in the fireplace .
okay .
just relax .
i did .
i know i did .
you were here alone ?
mm hmm .
yeah , luke had just left .
i didn' t see anything , though .
luke , can you help me ?
just ashes .
charred wood .
watch out .
let it go .
yep .
hello ?
santa ?
whoa !
jesus !
god !
god , are you all right ?
yeah , i' m fine .
what is that ?
a flue .
a what ?
it' s it' s an old flue !
it opens up the chimney .
god !
is this what you saw ?
no .
no , that' s not what i saw .
mm mmm , that is not what i saw .
god .
hey , are you okay ?
luke , are you okay ?
what ?
no , i' m not okay !
did you not see that thing ?
it almost crushed me !
yeah , i saw it .
jeez , i was only asking !
that' s what it was .
of course you were scared .
it scared the hell out of me too .
no , i know what i saw .
eleanor , this is a very confusing house .
you said it yourself .
nothing is what it seems .
look at me .
i' m not confused .
i saw something , and that wasn' t it .
there was something in there .
hey , you guys should take a look at this .
welcome home , eleanor " ?
oh , god .
what does that mean ?
his face .
it' s my name .
who did this ?
who wrote this ?
is this one of your sick jokes , luke ?
what ?
come on .
give me a little credit .
i think i have a better sense of humor than that .
do you really think i wrote that ?
you found it .
you could have .
oh , with what ?
with the 20 foot ladder that i keep in my back pocket ?
m maybe you wrote it , theo !
you' re the artist !
maybe this is your great idea of art !
don' t be ridiculous .
i wanna know right now !
who wrote this ?
did you write this , theo ?
no !
of course not !
maybe it was you !
how dare you accuse me of writing this !
maybe you like being the center of attention !
what are you talking about ?
let' s stop this now .
come on .
who was it ?
whoever wrote this , it' s cruel .
you don' t know me .
i didn' t do it .
eleanor .
are you all right ?
i know you think i did it , but i didn' t .
look , people are always  no , i' m not making this stuff up .
i mean , i know you all think i' m crazy or doing this for attention .
i' m not .
for what it' s worth , i believe you' re a very sensitive woman , and i believe that people have taken advantage of you in the past .
mmm .
welcome home .
you' il never see it again .
mr. dudley' s taking care of it .
come on .
there' s something i want you to see .
oh , this is beautiful !
thought you' d like it .
well , i wonder what happened to him .
yeah , yeah .
oh , violets .
somebody must' ve died here .
well .
you know , all my life i' ve been waiting for an adventure , and i thought it would never happen to me .
adventures are for soldiers ... or for the women the bullfighters fall in love with .
and here i am .
paintings are calling out to me , strange noises in the night , and all it cost was five gallons of gas .
do you really think that someone' s playing with you , eleanor ?
yeah , it doesn' t matter .
i can be a victim , or i can be a volunteer .
i' m gonna be a volunteer .
mm hmm .
eleanor .
eleanor !
eleanor , find us .
eleanor .
hmm ?
eleanor , the ledger .
the ledger .
what ?
it' s crain' s study .
concord .
oh , his textile mills .
man .
woman .
child .
child .
twelve years .
eleven years .
twelve years .
there' s so many of them .
ten years .
twelve years .
they died so young .
eleven years .
what happened to you ?
theo !
okay , okay .
theo !
yeah , what ?
there' s hundreds of them .
he kept records of everyone .
i was havin ' the best night' s sleep of my life .
i swear .
the names , the dates and the ages .
the names they' re crossed out .
it' s dead children , theo .
can we talk about this in the morning ?
they showed me .
they  [ sighs ]
oh , you' re never gonna believe how i found them .
how' d you find them ?
the blood led me to the bookcase .
the blood ?
little footprints in blood .

i' m listening .
dr. marrow ?
dr. marrow ?
dr. marrow ?
dr. marrow ?
eleanor vance continues ... her alienation of the other subjects .
it remains unclear what she saw in the fireplace ... and whether she truly believes she did not deface the painting .
interview with vance in greenhouse yesterday ... to ascertain the extent of her self delusion ... was inconclusive , due to subject' s ... emotional instability .
well , i think i know how experiments work .
wait a second .
hold on .
hold on , theo .
what about all the noises , and the fireplace and the painting ?
i think it' s an old academic " bait and switch , " where  what ? where you pretend that it' s a study on insomnia , but what he' s really interested in is seeing our reaction ...
to these phenomenons he' s obviously behind .
no .
it' s not dr. marrow .
oh , nell , i' ve been
are you all right ?
god , i' ve been looking for you everywhere .
are you okay ?
mm hmm .
it' s not dr. marrow .
then who ?
come on , nell .
if it' s not dr. marrow
if you don' t think this is really somehow part of the experiment , then why would you stay here another second ?
' cause home is where the heart is .
oh , my god !
what is it ?
oh , no .
what ?
what , nell ?
nell !
if it' s not dr. marrow , that' s a pretty scary proposition .
no , i' m not .
no , i' m not .
i' m not making this up !
no , i' m not .
i' m not , i know i' m
there is something there' s something in here .
i can prove it .
i can prove i know i can .
oh , i know it is .
carolyn .
carolyn was his second wife .
eleanor , the fireplace .
where ?
where are you ?
where are you ?
i' m here .

i' m gonna get you out .
i will .
i' il get you out .
don' t worry .
what' s that smell ?
i' m trying .
i' m trying .
he killed them .
what ?
he killed them .
the children from the mills .
it' s just like you said .
he wanted to fill the house with the sounds of children .
he took them from his mills and he brought them here , but he wouldn' t let them go .
he would never let them go .
and i found the skulls , just like carolyn did .
carolyn ?
who' s carolyn ?
killed who , eleanor ?
calm down , now .
and he had a second wife .
but he couldn' t hide his secret .
you can never hide a secret .
carolyn found out what he' d done .
and now he wants me .
who ?
who wants you ?
and why ?
she' s delusional .
but what is happening to her ?
she' s in a fugue state .
let' s get her to the sofa .
wanted to ... fill the house with children , but ...
get a blanket .
come on . he he turned into a monster .
it' s okay , sweetheart .
it' s okay .
no .
carolyn showed me in the photograph where she hid ' em .
and they' re all locked together in there .
he won' t let them go .
eleanor , listen to me .
listen to me .
listen to me .
it' s not true .
he' s still here .
hugh crain is still in the house .
no .
yeah .
i mean , what if she' s right ?
what if she' s right ?
what are you sayin ' , theo ?
it doesn' t do any good to talk about
stop .
stop !
stop !
what if she' s right ?
now , listen to me , all of you .
let me explain what' s happening .
you' re participating in a study on group fear and hysteria .
what ?
that' s why you brought us here ?
that' s what this is all about ?
you brought us here to scare us ?
is that it ?
yes .
you' re just waiting for her to have a total nervous breakdown before you said anything ?
no !
what is your problem ?
i gave you the clues .
you created the story as you were meant to .
but it' s over .
i' m pulling the plug .
oh , that
none of this is real .
no , it is real .
eleanor , it' s not real .
no !
you have to look at the bones in the fireplace !
it' s not real !
and then i saw i saw his wife , hanging in the greenhouse !
i know i saw it !
i' m sorry .
i' m sorry .
i' m sorry i brought you here , all of you .
the dudleys will be here in the morning , and then we can all go home at once .
no !
i can' t believe you' re not gonna look .
okay , that' s enough .
i' m taking her upstairs .
i think you' ve done enough .
i' il help you .
because it was a controlled experiment .
a controlled experiment ?
she' s in total shock !
you can' t do that !
i told you , it wasn' t meant to be like this .
oh , come on .
you don' t care about us .
you don' t care about insomnia .
you just wanted to scare the hell out of us so we' d fit into your little test ...
or model or whatever bullshit you need to understand this !
oh , please !
okay !
you can' t do it !
now , listen !
you listen .
i am trying to help people .
my field of study is the science of fear .
i try to understand why people act the way they act , why they feel the way they feel
you don' t feel .
where are you going ?
i' m gonna find out what eleanor was talking about .
what am i doing ?
good night .

the , uh , environment is proving entirely successful ... in promoting shared hysteria reactions .
