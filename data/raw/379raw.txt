your honor , my client did not fly home 5, 000 miles to jump bail .
you mean jump bail again .
no doubt .
he was in the wind for two years , judge .
if he decides to take off again , the mood of the people in this city ...
talk about the people !

back up , son !
hey , son .
hey , yo , you gonna get your ass twisted .
you better get off me !
your point is well taken , mr. torres .
defendant is ordered to surrender his passport to this court .
however , i believe that young mr. wade ... is sincere in his desire to deal with whatever form of judgment ... this room deems necessary to deliver .
bail is set at one million dollars .
what ?
no !
my client is prepared to post bail .
oh , no !
what the fuck is wrong with you ?

i remember when i took that job thinking i could fight from inside , and you telling me about all the problems .
that color thing ...
too black for the uniform , too blue for the brothers .
about how justice gets tangled up in red tape or bought off by the green .
you were right .
fuck that job .
fuck the badge .
i' il get that silver spoon motherfucker my own way .
no lawyers , politics , no rules .
no pension .

what about the waitress ?
paul , talk to him .
thank you .
the truth is , walter , we can' t find her .
this guy is great .
do you know why we can' t finder ?
' cause she doesn' t want to be found .
do you want to go back to switzerland while we track her down ?
it could take a year , two , ten , maybe never .
meanwhile , everything and everyone else is in place .
i don' t believe this .
even if she does surface , she is seriously damaged goods .
it s just a roll of the dice , kid .
i' il roll my own damn dice .
