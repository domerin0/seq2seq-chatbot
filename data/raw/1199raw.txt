basic principles ,
god , i hope i don' t get swept off my feet today .
this is a really bad time for me .
or , something like
i just need some space .
or , my personal favorite
i' m really into my career right now .
you believe that ?
neither does she .
you know why ?
because she is lying to you .
that' s why .
you understand me ?
lying .
it not a bad time for her .
she doesn t need any space .
she may be into her career .
but what she is really saying is
get away from me now .
or possibly , " try harder , stupid .
but which one is it ?
60 % of all human communication is nonverbal .
body language .
30 % is your tone .
that means that 90 % of what you' re saying , ain' t coming out of your mouth .
toby , toby !
shit !
of course she' s gonna lie to you .
she' s a nice person .
she doesn' t want to hurt your feelings .
what else is she gonna say ?
she doesn t even know you ... yet .
luckily , the fact is , just like the rest of us ,
even a beautiful woman doesn' t know what she wants until she sees it .
that' s where i come in .
my job is to open her eyes .
toby !
oh , my god !
is this what you are looking for ?
basic principles ,
no matter what , no matter when , no matter who ,
any man has a chance to sweep any woman off her feet .
just needs the right broom .
you can not use what you do not have .
so if you' re shy , be shy .
if you' re outgoing , be outgoing .
i' m not outgoing .
that' s ok .
she may not want the whole truth , but she does want the real you .
she may not want to see it all at once , but she does want to see .
so tonight , when you wonder what to say , or how you look , or whether or not she likes you ,
just remember , she is already out with you .
that means she said " yes " when she could' ve said " no " .
that means she made a plan when she could' ve just blown you off .
so that means it is no more your job to try to make her like you .
it is your job not to mess it up .
uh ?
shoes are hot .
you went to the place i told you , right ?
yeah , but i don' t think they are really me .
you " is a very fluid concept now .
you bought the shoes .
you look great in these shoes .
that' s the " you " that i am talking about .
now the key tonight is " hang back " .
give her plenty of place .
if she lingers at a photograph , move on .
but maintain the visual .
all right now .
it' s supposed to be 64 f and clear tonight .
so when you leave the club , walk a little .
ask her what she thought about the show .
what was her favorite photograph ?
why that one ?
and when she answers , don' t be looking at her mouth .
don' t be wondering what she looks like naked .
listen to what she is saying and respond .
listen and respond .
listen and respond .
that way , when it' s your turn to talk ,
you have something better to say than " i like your mouth .
what was your favorite one ?
the , uh ...
elephant , definitely .
yeah .
and all of a sudden , we' re on date number two .
no way .
we are going back in there .
you have to smile .
in case you didn' t go to high school , hitting is a good thing .
so how does it happen ?
great love .
are you ok ?
nobody knows .
good .
let me get a bun pop and a scoop ball for the lady .
but what i can tell you , is that it happens in the blink of an eye .
one moment you' re enjoying your life .
and the next , you' re wondering how you' ve ever lived without them .
three days is all that i need .
three days and i will get you here to the high stake meadow ground , where eight out of ten woman believe that the first kiss will tell them everything they need to know about the relationship .
after that , you are on your own .
but always remember ,
life is not the amount of breath you take .
it' s the moments that takes your breath away .
didn' t i call it , or did i call it ?
i mean what did i say , six months .
and when was her first date ?
so five and a half .
god , i hate it when i am right .
i mean what is it about guys , that makes them want to screw anything that walks ,
even when they are going out with someone as awesome as allegra cole .
i mean she' s only the single most fabulous thing walking around new york .
thanks , young .
are you kidding ?
of course i' m gonna run it .
why should she waste her heart on some swedish even if he is gorgeous .
hey , if he' s stupid enough to cheat , then the world should know he' s dumb enough to get caught .
exactly .
i' m in the elevator .
see you in a minute .
morning .
how are you ?
great sara .
better party of one ?
hey , you should try it sometime .
banbados by myself ?
i wouldn t last five minutes .
just did what the doctor ordered .
i slept in , i did my yoga ,
i read a couple of books , i flirted with my scuba instructor .
and apparently never left the office ?
i know .
isn' t that great ?
you should' ve taken someone with you .
who ?
who am i going to take with me ?
this is where boyfriend comes in handy .
i don' t have time for a boyfriend .
you said that two years ago .
yes .
it is as true today as it was then .
hey , i thought you were on vacation .
see if these were in focus , will you ?
and have it on desk in an hour ?
cool .
and beside , relationships are for people that are just waiting for something better to come along .
ahh .
spoken like a true cynic .
i' m not a cynic .
i' m a realist .
a realist masquerading as a cynic , who is secretly an optimist .
what are you doing here ?
what is she doing here ?
she works here , remember ?
no , she doesn t .
not for another four days .
well , this couldn' t wait .
of course it could .
what are you doing ?
go back to the beach .
i don' t want you here .
oh , no , really you do .
you are becoming a sick workaholic lunatic .
that is exactly the kind of nervous overall behavior that leads to ...
pictues of sebby with busty brunettes .
a very very big raise .
jesus !
you could find dirt in a snowstorm .
comes with the job .
you know kido .
there is more to life than watching other people live it .
can i help you with cheating on my beach ?
hey , i think it' s great that you are so good at your job .
i' m just a little worried as to why .
let me worry about that .
ok .
i want that column on my desk by lunch .
does that mean you are going to pay for my hotel ?
for you to sip my ties ?
i don' t think so .
get out .
oh , come on .
what ?
that' s good , right ?
no .
it was in it .
it freaks out .
you know what your problem is , hitch ?
you' re all about the short game .
you pick your shots based on what you see first .
not what' s uhh ... necessarily best for you in the long run .
well , all of us are not married to the woman of our dream and is about to have a baby .
i am very happy for you .
just not meant for everybody .
so please just leave me to my hot , sweaty , totally very wildly experimental short game .
i was just talking about pool .
but you know , what ever .
yeah , ok .
honestly , i just hope one day you are able to experience the unconditional love
and the trust and the openness that ...
you know , i share with grace every single day .
is this really barroom talk ?
no , you need to listen to me , man .
i' m serious .
because when you get to a place with a woman like that ,
it' s so beyond anything physical .
when i think back , when i used to run around with you and chase those really gorgeous but shallow women and ...
i know it' s ...
it' s kind of ridiculous , and vaguely pathetic .
yeah , i see what you mean .
that' s pathetic .
that , that' s pathetic .
uh huh .
so how did you meet him ?
i was in the brelin and i was just buying some weekend gowns .
and he was doing likewise ?
no .
look , yeah .
actually he said he was buying some for his mom .
his mom ?
casey . who buy high price lingerie for their mother ?
no , no .
maybe he was looking for a robe .
oh , casey .
casey .
he was hitting on you while he was buying lingerie for another woman .
well , i prefer the mother story .
i know you prefer it , but that' s not the point .
no .
the point is , i' m not gonna start out assuming the guy is a liar .
why not ?
because this is how you end up ...
like me ?
is that what you are going to say ?
no .
i was going to say " like you " .
what is his name ?
why ?
i' m going to google him .
no .
google your own guy .
let' s just to see if his mother is still alive .
so when is grace due again ?
soon .
you' re excited ?
what did you say ?
do you want me to go get them and bring them over here ?
no .
no , don' t do that .
are you saying you don' t want to talk to them because you can' t go home with them ?
hey , what do you want from me ?
i just trying to keep my head above water .
hey , did you ever hear this guy they called " date doctor " ?
every man .
really ?
absolutely .
i was kind of hope he also help women .
casey .
you' re not sick .
you are single .
you just have to relax and enjoy the ride .
i haven' t been ridden in months .
that' s a happy note .
i' m going to go see if anybody interesting came in tonight .
oh , you mean besides me ?
right ?
right .
i' m gonna go get those girls and i' m gonna bring them over here before we have a conversation like human beings .
then you are going to go home and i' m going to take them back to my apartment .
that sounds like fun for me , but you know , you might wanna get in line , pal .
hey, baby .
can i get a cup of corona over at the pool table , please .
thanks .
excuse me .
excuse me .
a bottle is fine .
hey , asshole , i don' t work here .
wow .
i am sorry .
the paramedic is gonna have to come to get my foot out of my mouth , sweetheart .
just don' t let it happen again .
i knew you did not work here .
you did ?
how else was i supposed to get you away from all those guys .
why would you want to do that ?
some guys naturally develop a comfort with the opposite sex .
they like women , women like them .
everything flows naturally .
back in college , i was just not one of them .
i seemed to lack the basic understanding that my peers just intuitively grasp .
but like any late bloomer , i was eager to make up for lost time .
her name was cressida baylor .
would you tell me where the register building is ?
yeah .
and my life would never be the same .
i am alex .
cressida .
what we had was beautiful .
i love you .
i love you so much .
i love you too , alex .
i know you don' t love me as much as i love you .
i mean , but that is ok .
i am just glad you love me at all .
in retrospect , i guess i may have come on a little strong .
but the experience taught me a lot .
cressida !
what are you doing ?
i am sorry , alex .
but i love you .
i love you .
want did i do wrong ?
just tell me what i did wrong .
dude !
you are doing it right now .
i am sorry .
it is an education i feel obliged to pass on to my fellow men .
becuse with no guile , and no game , there is no girl .
and if ever there was a man born without a game , it was albert brennaman .
my business is 100 % referral .
and thus far , untraceable .
and if there is one thing i' ve learned when you orchestrate , coordinate , and otherwise mess with fate ,
it is best to fly under the radar .
i hope she is single , because i don' t do breakups .
hi , thank you for seeing me .
no .
i mean , she just got out of a relationship .
is that a problem ?
because if it is , fine .
i am a little uncomfortable with this anyway , you know .
definitely , have been hurt a lot .
you know , i had a lot of bad experiences .
some good ones .
you know definitely a lot of bad ones .
and you know , i am desperate , basically , i mean .
not in general , you understand ?
not just for anybody .
but i mean for her .
why don' t you tell me about her ?
let' s see .
what can i say ?
my company handles her finances .
i am her tax consultant .
well , i am one of them .
i am the junior man on the account .
so does she know you are interested ?
oh , no no no .
no .
alive ?
i lent her my pen once .
shoot .
does anyone have a pen ?
here take mine .
albert , you are crushing my arm .
sorry about that .
allegra , as in allegra cole ?
yeah , i realize that i am not her usual type .
well , her last boyfriend , like owns sweden or something .
and the guy was a bum .
he just , he didn' t seem like a very nice person to me .
you swing for the fence .
ok , look .
you don' t think i tried to talk myself out of this .
you don' t think i know how ridiculous this is ?
i know .
ok .
i just thought maybe with your help , i just ...
you know what ?
i am really sorry i wasted your time .
hold on a second , albert .
you know what it is like .
getting up every morning , feeling hopeless ,
feeling like , the love of your life is waking up with the wrong man ,
but at the same time , hope that she still finds happiness ,
even if she is never gonna be with you .
you are flat out , out of your mind .
you know that ?
yeah .
that is good .
it is ?
good ?
you ever heard michelangelo ?
yeah .
heard of the sistine chapel ?
yeah ?
michelangelo , sistine chapel .
so you can do this ?
my name is alex hitchens .
let' s go paint that ceiling .
take it easy .
oh my god .
oh god .
well it looks like i am still rich .
but what i would really like , and what i was wondering is ,
if i can have $500, 000 to invest on my own ?
oh ?
and what were you thinking of investing in , allegra ?
well , it' s something that i really have a passion for .
daydreams are for private time .
when you in the room , be in the room .
concentrate , focus .
women respond when you respond to them .
see , my friend maggie , is a really talented designer .
i' ve seen the business plan .
the samples look fantastic .
and i would really , really like to get involved .
i' il tell you what .
let us just come up with a range of investment that we think you might be interested in , and next month we will run the whole lot of them by you .
hum ?
ok .
fine .
thank you .
all right , gentlemen , the next ...
let' s go over this one more time .
what is the objective ?
shock and awe .
that is shockingly awful .
what is the objective ?
shock and awe .
what is the objective ?
excuse me , sir .
yes , albert ?
i don' t really agree with that .
you don' t really agree with what ?
i think if you want to invest half a million dollars in your friend' s business ,
that is exactly what you should do .
albert !
you don' t need us to tell you what to do .
we are a board of advisors .
we are not your kindergarten teachers .
and if you want to be taken seriously as an adult ,
i suggest you start taking yourself seriously as an adult .
instead of asking for permission to invest your own money from a boardroom full of your daddy s golf buddies .
that is quite enough .
you know i am finished .
i' d like to see anybody in this room , handle the attention and publicity that she has to deal with her whole life with half of her class .
we should be taking advice from you , miss cole .
not the other way around .
sit down , mister .
no , you know what , i quit .
oh , my god .
just breathe , just breathe .
how did it go ?
i yelled at her .
i turned in my boss .
i quit my job .
what ?
you said ...
i gotta go back .
not tell you to quit .
listen , we are fine .
we are fine .
ok ?
just let me go .
albert .
no no .
just relax , ok ?
just let them marinate for a second .
trust me .
no .
it is allegra cole .
answer it .
can i speak to you for a second ?
answer it .
answer the door , albert .
yes , hi .
what' s up ?
listen , albert , right ?
people don' t usually talk to me like that , ok ?
close your mouth , man .
let me re phase that .
people never talk to me like that .
stand up .
i guess it is kind of scary for them .
but that' s why i really appreciate what you did in there .
but i was wondering , do you think you and i could get together sometime this week ?
you know , to go over things , financial things .
you see , i like to see the area where i can afford to take some risks .
check your schedule .
i have to check my schedule , miss cole .
great .
let me give you my number .
do you have a pen ?
i don' t look like i have one .
yes , i do .
great .
call me allegra .
you are done .
good bye .
good job .
albert .
oh damn .
she is some kind of newspaper columnist .
comes in here once in a while .
great tipper .
what is her drink ?
usually beer .
tonight , grey goose martini , dirty .
hi .
i noticed your glass was getting a little low .
so i took a liberty of bringing you another apple martini .
thank you .
and i couldn t help but notice you look a lot like my next girlfriend .
what is your name ?
they call me chip .
aha , you can' t get them to stop ?
that was funny .
listen , chip , i understand the courage to take to walk across the room and try to generate a relationship out of thin air .
so don' t take the following personally .
you have fantastic eyes .
thanks .
try to listen .
this is no selection on you .
i am just not interested .
but thank you for the compliment of coming over .
you are welcome .
so do you like cuban food ?
chip , seriously , that was not a code for " i wish you try harder " .
are you always so shutdown , and afraid that the right man might make you feel like ...
like a natural woman ?
sorry , i am late , honey .
i could get a cab .
how was the meeting ?
oh well , there was a beginning , a middle , and an end .
nice to meet you , chip .
you too .
now on the one hand it is very difficult for a man to even speak to someone who looks like you .
but on the other hand , should that be your problem ?
so life is kind of hard all around .
well , not if you pay attention .
i mean you send out all the right signals .
no earrings , heels under two inches , your hairs pulled back .
you wear reading glasses , but no book .
drinking a grey goose martini , which means you have a hell of a week , and beer just wouldn' t do it .
if that wasn' t enough , there is always the " fuck off " that you have stamped on your forehead .
because who is gonna believe that there is man out there that can sit down beside a woman he does not know , and genuinely be interested in who she is , what she does , without his own agenda .
i wouldn' t even know what that would look like .
so what would a guy like that say ?
well , he' d say my name is alex hitchens , and i am a consultant .
but she wouldn' t be interested in that , because she probably be just counting seconds until he left .
thinking he was like every other guy .
which life experience has taught her is a virtual certainty .
but then he d ask her name and what she did for a living .
and she might blow him off , or she might say ...
i am sara melas .
i run the gossip column at the standard .
then he would ask all these penetrating questions about it , because he was sincerely , if atypically interested .
no .
he' d be interested .
but he' d see that these was no way he could possibly make her realize that he was for real .
well , he could be funny and charming , and refreshingly original .
wouldn' t help .
doesn' t he hate it when that happens .
not really .
they both probably go on to lead a life they were headed toward .
my guess is , they do just fine .
the pleasure to have met you , sara melas .
great goose martini , from the gentleman who just left .
woo , is that for me ?
what ?
ben , sorry i am late .
oh , no .
not a problem .
wow , you are the ....
can i get something to drink , sir ?
no , no .
i am fine .
thank you .
so tell me about her .
have you ever met someone , and you knew right away , she is gonna be important to you .
not just because of her looks , but , you know , that x factor ...
how did you meet her ?
actually , i was in a shop buying pajamas for my mom .
and by that , of course you mean you are buying lingerie for another woman .
yes .
you can' t help when you meet somebody , can you ?
and the lingerie was for a woman i am no longer seeing .
so , but anyway , the girl i met , the one i was talking about .
she is so sweet , funny , southern .
she gave me a number , now she won' t return my phone calls .
i don' t know what it is about her .
i just can' t get her out of my mind .
food has lost its taste , colors , you know , they seem dull .
and things that used to matter , i don' t know , they just no longer do .
i think things are not gonna snap back unless i ...
unless i bang her .
excuse me ?
you know , bang her , clear my head .
get in , get off , get out .
i think you may have misunderstood what i do exactly .
no , i was told you help guys get in there .
right .
but see , there is the thing , my clients actually like women .
hit and quit is not my thing .
let me make one thing clear to you , rabbi .
i need professional help .
well , that is for damn certain .
and i am glad you can admit it , because generally that is the hardest part .
you see what i am doing ?
this is what i am about .
power suit , power tie , power steering .
people can wince , cry , beg .
but eventually , they do what i want .
oh , so that is like a metaphor .
oh , yeah .
right , well , i am more of a literal kind of guy .
so when i do this .
this is more like me saying that i will literally break your shit off if you ever touch me again .
ok , pumpkin ?
got it .
no .
no .
i can' t just mention your restaurant ?
somebody has to eat there .
no .
somebody famous , you know that .
sara melas ?
no , no , no .
ok , bye .
i need your signature .
i hated when a guy calls a girl who did not give him her number .
so this is me not calling , over .
yes , you' re right .
this is much less invasive .
listen , i' ve been thinking about that sign on your forehead .
i was wondering you would mind taking it down for dinner friday night , over .
oh , i can' t .
i have a couple of parties i have to hit .
gossip never sleeps .
not till about 4 a. m.
saturday ?
i am , i have a date .
do you know the definition of perseverance , miss melas ?
an excuse to be obnoxious ?
continuing a course of action without regard to discouragement , opposition or previous failure , over .
ok , webster .
how do i get rid of you ?
breakfast sunday .
and you can barely even call that a date .
you do that with out of town relatives that you don' t even like .
ok .
i guess i can do sunday .
you forgot to say " over " , over .
this conversation is over as soon as you tell me when and where .
7 a. m. , north cove marina , over now .
7 a. m. , are you crazy ?
i don' t do 7 a. m.
hello ?
sign here .
what ?
said sunday , right ?
yeah ?
what if i would' ve said friday ?
sunday ?
so , i guess you are not going to church .
do you really expect me to wear this ?
that would be awfully cold out there without it .
good morning .
good if it would be at 10 .
you are a lot taller than i remember .
you ever ride one of these ?
not in the hudson .
so what do you want to do ?
race me around the statue of liberty ?
if there is time .
you might need these .
all right .
wow , how do i look ?
fabulous .
all right .
i give .
where do i change ?
so we go out passing the wall .
take a left and it' s pretty much a straight shot from there .
straight shot to where ?
that' s for me to tell you to find out .
so look .
what you do with these babies is ...
yeah , what i do with these babies is to kick your ass .
hey !
hey !
what happened ?
you changed your mind ?
it just died .
did you put gas in it ?
yeah , no , you know .
i bet it must have sucked up a diaper or something .
gross .
try it again .
you want me to call aaa ?
come all around and let me hop over yours .
i don' t know .
what if you break mine , too .
then we will both be sitting ducks .
i didn' t break it .
it just died .
yeah , yeah .
all right , hop on .
come on .
go back .
hey , i' m already here .
yeah , but you don' t know where we are going .
why don' t you tell me and we will both know .
sara ?
man , male egos .
i don' t know how you guys make it through the day with them .
what ?
it is not my ego .
i just don' t want to ruin a surprise .
sara !
i' m sorry .
are you all right ?
i always keep a few of those around .
thank you .
i have lower back trouble .
i just shovel the ice pack right down there .
oh , no , no .
this is a fresh one .
so , ellis island .
i have to admit .
i have lived in new york my whole life .
and i' ve never been here .
i figured that most people haven' t .
so i got my man larry here to set us a private tour .
anything for hitch .
it was originally known as oyster island .
the island was expand to its present size with dirt , removed during the construction of the new york subway system .
are you serious ?
yes .
did you know this ?
yes .
i mean that' s why i brought you here .
in fact , over 100 million of americans can trace their ancestors back to a single man , woman or a child on the ship' s manifest to an inspector' s ledger .
by 1910 , 75 % of the residents of new york , chicago , detroit ...
it' s called the " kissing post " .
the plaque explains how different cultures kiss after long absences .
what exactly would qualify as a long absence ?
i mean , like ...
no .
i actually have a relative come through here .
really ?
yeah .
what ?
what ?
what' s that thing ?
no .
you know , i was just thinking , uh ...
you can' t know where you are going ,
until you know where you' ve been .
ain' t that right , larry ?
you' re the man , brother .
it' s kind of deep for a first date , don' t you think ?
what is there ?
oh , my god !
it' s my great great grandfather .
that' s his signature .
i mean , jesus , it' s right here .
how did you ...
how did you know ?
hitch did the search .
i just found the page .
i thought that going differently in my mind .
my family never saw him again , except from the wanted posters .
look , i am really sorry .
when i saw that on the computer , it said " the butcher of cadiz " .
you know , i thought it was a profession .
not a headline .
it' s one of those horrible family legacies we all tried to forget .
thank you .
no , it was ...
a train wreck .
yeah .
no .
i' il get you a cab .
thanks .
bye .
bye bye .
taxi .
poor guy .
sounds like went into a lot of trouble .
it was fun .
in a disaster' s kind of way .
i mean this isn' t exactly a hickey .
at least you got your story out of it , right ?
right ?
you should try mine .
it' s great .
wait .
you are seeing him again ?
look .
you said i am always expecting men to let me down , right ?
assuming they are going to fail ,
which he did .
yeah ?
but he did it with flare .
i mean , casey , really taint .
and that' s a desirable trait .
yeah , weird , huh ?
now just keep it simple .
just like we practice .
we' re just leaving a message here , ok ?
women like allegra cole don' t pick up numbers they don' t recognize .
hello ?
she' s on the phone .
yes , hello , miss cole ?
hi , i have an albert brennaman for you .
one moment please .
tell her i am at lunch .
we called her to tell her you are at lunch ?
allegra .
hi , it' s albert brennaman .
hi , how are you ?

allegra , over here please .
miss cole , this way .
hi there .
this was a fantastic idea .
i suppose .
hey , where is maggie ?
late as usual .
tonight i want you to meditate on the image of an iceberg .
you know why i want you do to that ?
because i' m cool ?
no .
i know i' m not .
i' m saying that you' re an iceberg in that over 90 % of your mass is below the surface .
i know i' m heavy .
i am .
i am talking about who you are .
it' s a metaphor .
accounting , business , all of that is just a small part of a much deeper , richer albert .
i know it' s gonna be loud in there .
so this is our opportunity to break the touch barrier in a non sleazy way .
so get her to where it' s the loudest .
ask her if she likes a drink .
lean in , put your hand on the small of her back , say in her ear like a secret .
but watch your hand placement .
too high , says " i just want to be friends .
too low says " i just want to grab some ass .
all right .
friends , ass , me .
special issues .
allegra cole is a celebrity , which means when people talk to her , they will ignore you completely .
she' s classy .
so she will introduce you .
when she does do , shake hands hard and speak up .
let them know you are there .
show her you can handle being her escort .
egon , this is albert .
egon .
albert , this is zak .
nice to see you .
these guys are friends of maggie .
have you been to that new brazilian restaurant ?
no , but i am looking ...
it' s disgusting .
i am writing an article about it .
did you see that new station ?
yes .
did you ...
it' s disgusting .
disgusting .
women can always tell when you are not being real with them .
the worst thing you can do is trying to fake it .
because you are a great guy and you do have something to offer to allegra than no other man does .
what' s your name , mad dog ?
egon .
what do you think of the design of the new football stadium on the west side ?
uh ...
let me guess , disgusting ?
think it over .
we' il be back .
thank you .
i can' t stand those guys .
really ?
i kind of like them .
but when all that said done .
tonight is not about allegra .
it' s not ?
no .
tonight is about maggie .
a woman' s best friend has to sign off on all big relationship decisions .
so you can' t afford to mess this up .
albert , i want you to meet my friend , maggie .
hi , maggie .
it' s an absolute pleasure to meet you .
i' m maggie .
no , you' re not .
actually i am .
magnus forester .
thank you so much for inviting us .
very soft hands .
thank you .
wow , so do you .
thank you .
so tonight , you focus on one thing and one thing only .
maggie .
where did your inspiration come from ?
oh , my god .
anything i see .
something in a
out on the streets , in an old movie .
there' s certain nature of creative facility just astounds me .
oh , anybody wants some spring rolls ?
it' s a beautiful time by the way .
i mean this whole thing , it just works .
thank you .
is he gay ?
i don' t think so .
i like him .
now about the dj , generally i have a firm " no dancing " policy .
but if she asks , you can not say " no " .
dancing is the one thing i' m not worried about .
but if there are people there ...
i' m sorry .
i have to be a stickler .
but i need to be thorough .
show me what you mean by you are not worried about it .
trust me .
yes , i do .
that' s where it' s all about right there .
see how it gets bigger .
now i' m gonna start the fire .
put the feet going .
i start the fire .
i make the pizza .
hips are always going .
kick in the hip .
there , the q tip .
q tip .
q tip .
throw it away .
that' s not working .
you hit with it .
don' t ever do that again .
do you hear me ?
just express myself .
no .
no .
not like that , you are not .
all right .
this is where you live .
right here .
you live right here .
this is home .
like this .
i want to see none of that .
they don' t need no pizza .
they got food there .
elbows , six inches from the waist .
ninety degree angles .
don' t you bite your lips .
stop it .
ok ?
women relate dancing to sex .
all right .
even a great dancer can lose it with one of these .
ok , you know , that' s what i need to be learning .
i can' t stop it .
you can not stop it .
next subject .
get out .
thanks .
so , you are knicks fun ?
when they are good .
hey .
hey .
i' m really sorry .
oh , god , why ?
she was there ?
i left a bunch of messages .
my phone fell in the hudson , sam .
it gets worse .
i don' t believe this .
i thought he was a bodyguard .
the only one she was getting protection around here is from me .
max is gonna ...
gonna be very irritated .
you know when i got on the train this morning , i thought this was going to be a good day .
who the hell is albert brennaman ?
i need you to tell me how it happened .
what dude ?
some photographers .
does this even look like dance to you ?
just a little bit me .
being me .
no , albert .
that' s you being a lot better something that you don' t need to ever be again .
just one dance .
no .
one dance , one look , one kiss .
that' s all we get , albert .
just one shot to make the difference between
happily ever after " and " oh , he' s just some guy i went to something once .
all right ?
what ?
you said " kiss " .
is that a problem ?
it' s not a problem , but i don' t know .
this is allegra cole ...
albert .
eight out of ten women believe the first kiss will tell them everything that they need to know about a relationship .
and believe me , she has definitely thought about it .
she has ?
oh , of course .
i mean not that she' s going to act on it .
so it' s no real big deal .
all right .
well it' s no big deal .
it' s a very big deal , albert .
huge .
monumental .
you are not listening .
you need to wrap your head around this .
tomorrow night , allegra cole could have her last first kiss .
all right , come on .
just show me what you got .
what do you mean ?
just go to show me how you will kiss me .
why would i kiss you ?
i' m not me .
i' m allegra .
but you are really not .
ok , albert .
at the end of the night , you are dropping me off at home .
show me the magic .
yeah , you know i' m really not comfortable with this .
god , albert .
i had such a wonderful time with you .
yeah , how about " twist and fix " , huh ?
you see what i' m doing ?
right ?
this is a signal .
ok ?
i' m fiddling with my keys .
all right ?
a woman that doesn' t want to kiss , takes the keys out ,
puts them in the door , goes into the house .
the woman that wants the kiss , she fiddles .
i' m a fiddler .
ok , you have a good night , i don' t know .
you see what i' m doing ?
robbing me ?
no .
see this one most guys do , they rush in to take the kiss .
but you are not " most guys " .
the secret to a kiss , is to go 90 % of the way .
and then hold .
for how long ?
as long as it takes .
for her to come the other 10 .
ok , 90 10 .
got it .
ok .
come on and shake it off .
it' s your turn .
i had a really nice time tonight , albert .
great night tonight too , allegra .
isn' t it weird ?
what' s up ?
i' m not feeling that .
what do you mean ?
i came 90 .
i' m not feeling like you want it .
look , i' m allegra cole .
the woman of your dreams .
the woman whose green eyes are limpid pools of desires .
now show me the magic , albert .
show me the magic .
what' s the hell was that ?
i' m showing you the magic .
no , i said come 90 then i come 10 .
you don' t go the whole 100 .
my mouth wasn' t open , albert .
you over eager son of wah ...
other than that , how was it ?
they came together .
they danced together and they left together .
he' s cute .
she got kind of way .
hey , for all i know , he' s adorable .
with him dating her , it' s ...
you seem stressed .
you and i had an understanding .
if you invite allegra , you are supposed to call me .
sara , i didn' t invite her .
honestly sweetie , i thought she was still in europe .
so you invited albert .
no .
well it says here the tickets were to some guy named alex hitchens .
the machine .
hi , it' s sara .
i just want to say thank you for uh ...
an unforgettable experience the other day .
and if you ever thought of your shirt again , you can come by the fountain dish market tonight around 8 o' clock .
ok .
bye .
you think he will show ?
yeah .
he' s too much of a player to have a bad day on his record .
is this a source or a date ?
a source .
it sounds like a date .
well it was supposed to .
so it looks like a date , and it sounds like a date .
but it' s not a date .
yeah .
right .
just checking .
hi .
hi .
i wasn' t sure you got my message .
i wasn' t sure you called the right guy .
you must be neglect for punishment .
either that , or i really want to pay you back .
i think this is yours .
thank you .
i am gonna frame this for my wall of shame .
really , there is a whole wall ?
