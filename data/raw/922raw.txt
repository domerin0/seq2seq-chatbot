it was a light spank , it was light ,
hey , hey ,
uh , do i just go in there ?
um , no , he' s not finished yet ,
but you can have a seat over there , oh , ok ,
let me explain something to you , henderson ,
i did not dislike your ideas , i found them loathsome ,
i hated them ,
you' re dismissed , from your office ?
nice try ,
good luck , you' re gonna need it ,,, he' s ready to see you ,
you can come in ,
you know what ?
we should have never let up after the revolution !
sit down , sit down , coffee ?
we shouldn' t have left you at toehold , we should have driven you to the sea !
now ,,, what' s this i hear about you making threats to spray this place with an ak 47 ?
what ?
oh , oh , oh , no , that ,,, i was just making a joke ,
oh , that' s funny to you ?
killing everyone in this office ?
no , no , no , no , no , no , the ,,, paul said how i never get angry ,,,
and what about you making fun of midgets ?
i never made fun of midgets ,
you said it' d be fun to date one because then you could rest your beer on her head ,
no , no , i never said anything like that ,
apparently henderson thinks you did ,
now i' ve got a good sense of humor , but that' s just plain sick ,
but , sir , i didn' t say ,,, audrey ?
which file did i ask you for ?
uh , the platt file ?
john platt , not sam platt , i' m sorry , i guess i didn' t think that ,,,
that' s right , you didn' t think ,
now if it' s not too much trouble , if you could fetch me the right file ,,,
ok , and get tom and me some doughnuts ,
ok ,
now ,,, i' m told you' ve been trying to schedule a meeting with me about some ideas , what are they ?
oh , uh ,,, yeah , i had i had some ideas ,
something wrong with the coffee ?
uh , no , it' s fine ,
why' d you make a face ?
what ?
oh , well ,,, it' s it' s a little bitter , but ,,,
jesus , audrey , get in here !
sir , really , it' s f ,,, it' s not a problem ,
i' ve burped up stuff better than this , sir , it' s fine ,
ls something wrong ?
taste tom' s coffee ,
no , really , it' s ok ,
how would you rate that ?
well , it' s not that great ,
not that great ?
i guess so , tom thinks it' s shit ,
audrey , are you retarded ?
it' s not a rhetorical question , are you retarded ?
no , i' m not retarded ,
because a retarded person can make a cup of coffee , am i right , tom ?
oh , l ,,, i don' t i don' t really know much about the limitations of the handicapped ,
i know of an employment agency that hires out retarded people for $4 an hour ,
so , if making a cup of coffee is too difficult a task for you , miss bennett , perhaps you' d be good enough to let me know , and i' il contact this agency and give a retarded person a job ,
) wow ,
i wasn' t too rough on her , was l ?
well , she is new and all ,
maybe i was out of line , but do you understand what i' m dealing with ?
i mean , here i am trying to fill a position in creative , and i can' t seem to find one person responsible enough to earn my trust ,
i sometimes wonder if anyone here even knows what they' re doing ,
i can understand how you could see it that way , sir , but ,,,
so you don' t think i was out of line ?
well , if what you' re saying is that a company is only as strong as its weakest link , that makes sense , but ,,,
exactly , that' s exactly right ,
a company is only as strong as its weakest link ,
yeah ,,, audrey , get in here !
you were right , tom , i was too soft on her ,
what ?
no , yeah ?
audrey , after talking it over with tom here ,
i' ve come to realize that i' m gonna have to let you go ,
you' re firing me ? !
i' m sorry , it' s just not working out ,
but , sir , i was suggesting ,,, i take my job very seriously ,
a chain is only as strong as its weakest link ,
right , but there' s a whole other side , thanks for the support ,
audrey , empty out your desk by the end of the day ,
fine , sir , this ,,, l ,,,
thanks for straightening me out there , tom ,
right , right , but i didn' t get to say what i wanted to say ,
oh , your ideas , of course , schedule an appointment with my new secretary ,
tom , are you ok ?
uh ,,, yeah , sure ,
i' m guessing by the way you look he' s on another one of his rampages this morning ,
definitely , damn ,
i was hoping to catch him in a good mood ,
yeah , that' s , um ,,, that' s probably not gonna happen ,
i' m supposed to go to this party tonight , but my dad' s making me housesit for his stupid bird while he' s away this weekend ,
well , why don' t you go in there and tell him you' re not gonna do it ?
i can' t just ,,,
you can' t just what ?
i mean , live your own life and have a free weekend ?
no , it' s not that ,
wait , it is that , yeah ,
i should just go to that party , yeah , of course ,
well , um ,,, ok , i' m gonna go back to , uh , work ,
ok , sure ,
tom ?
i know this might seem a little out of place because we barely even know each other ,
but , do you have any plans tonight ?
) no , no , no ,
uh ,,, no , i' m i' m wide open , we won' t be home too late ,
hey , it' s no problem ,
so the party starts at 7 , you could be at my dad' s house by 6 ?
sure , you sure you' re cool with this ?
are you kidding me ?
tom , you' re such a sweetheart ,
thank you so much , i' m gonna love you forever for this ,
all right , yeah , who' s the man now ?
see ?
what' d i tell you ?
) i' m a lady killer ,
how the hell could he be so excited about housesitting ?
he' s nice , daddy , that' s how , most guys wouldn' t even offer to do that ,
i don' t know if i want him around my bird ,
oh , dad , will you just relax ?
it' s gonna be fine , i promise , ok ?
i' il check in as soon as i get there , 8 : 00 ,
lf i sense anything' s wrong , you' re coming back here ,
ok , ok ,
very good , right on time ,
oh , sir , uh ,,, hey , is that a bear trap ?
yes , it' s to keep the neighbor' s kids out of my yard ,
sir , i just wanted to let you know how much i appreciate you ,,, well ,,, letting tonight happen ,
i mean , i know it means a lot to lisa , and i think you' re doing the right thing ,
i don' t know what you' re planning , stansfield , but you' re attitude is making me very nervous ,
those socks are clean , right ?
um ,,,
you hesitated , put those on , are you serious ?
lf you want to watch tv , the remote' s there ,
that panel controls the lights , alarm , skylight , etc ,
yeah , i probably won' t use any of that stuff ,
you know , since the party starts at 7 , party ?
i made it clear to lisa you' re not to have any guests in here ,
you' re the only one allowed in the house ,
what ?
lisa' s not here ?
no , of course not ,
lisa' s at the party ,,, and i' m staying here ,
ls this concept too complicated for you , stansfield ?
don' t touch the furniture ,
and this is my bird' s room , ) he' s got his own room ?
that' s cool ,
) how' s my little boy ?
this is oj , oj ?
like the murderer ?
no , like the football player , oj simpson ,
i' ve set the alarm , when you hear it go off , feed him ,
) aw , what do i feed these little guys ?
they don' t get fed , they are the food , his diet varies , but they' re his favorites ,
hey , don' t you have to shut these doors ?
not anymore , he' s been depressed since his mate died ,
he won' t fly , just sits in his cage ,
medication , give him two of these at 1 0 : 00 ,
i have to shove these down his throat ?
just one , the other is inserted into his rectum ,
don' t worry , it' s not too unpleasant for him ,
he doesn' t bite , does he ?
no , not unless you taunt him ,
you' re not planning on taunting him , are you , tom ?
no , i mean , that' d be really sick ,
no , of course not ,
and the most important thing , make sure he gets a pint of water ,
the medication tends to dry him out and then he can' t breathe ,
ok , well , i must be off ,
henderson should be waiting outside , henderson ?
i thought you fired him ,
because his ideas were stupid ?
of course not ,
he' s gonna drive me to the train station ,
so , you can leave as soon as lisa and hans get back ,
hans ?
lisa' s boyfriend ,
so remember , uh ,,, water in the bowl , medication , and ,,, anything happens to this house while i' m gone , i' il kill you ,
) ) you' re housesitting ?
you gotta be kidding me .
) i know , it sucks ,
what are you talking about ?
don' t you see ?
this is a test .
you watch taylor' s house , come up with a couple of great ideas and if everything goes smooth , you get the promotion .
you think so ?
of course i do .
what could be easier ?
) ( .
not what i wanted " by evan olson ))
) what are you doing , hans ?
come here .
baby , you' re gonna burn so bad if you don' t let me put this on you right now .
oh , my god .
you scared me , hans .
you' re insane .

my sister in ?
no , actually she' s out for the evening ,
bingo , ) oh ,
so , uh , you' re here to ,,,
housesit , oh ,

why ? ls there a problem ?
well , you know how uptight she is ,
really ?
i' m more the free spirit of the family ,
oh , oh , boy , see that right there ?

yeah ,
i did the deed with michelle pfeiffer' s cousin ,

well , uh , ya certainly have an interesting life , fred ,

no , i' m single , no girlfriend ?
no , and , no , actually i had a girlfriend , but we , uh , broke up ,
ah , ah ,
listen , i really gotta get back to work , and since you got your tv guide and ,,,
so , you broke up , huh ?
that' s too bad ,

yeah ,
yeah , in my opinion she was ,
i bet you you still keep a picture of her in your wallet ,
yeah , i do , can i see it ?
yeah , i suppose , ok ,
let me find her in here , there she is , ) oh !

look , i just ,,, i don' t tell comfortable talking about my intimate relationships with a complete stranger ,
understood ,
well , you know , given how uptight you are talking about sex , you pretty much answered the question ,
i am not uptight !
ok ?
just because i don' t feel like revealing personal details about my ex girlfriend' s sexual habits does not make me uptight ,
i didn' t ask you anything personal ,
well , then , what the hell do you consider personal ?
well , it' d be like , you know , if i asked you how big your rod was ,
then i would be out of line , 1 00 %%% ,
no , no !
that is no worse than asking me if my girlfriend' s a nymph ,
i just asked you if she dug sex ,
besides , i wouldn' t have asked if i' d known she was frigid ,
yeah , well , she is not frigid !
are you leaving ?
oh , yeah ,
and listen , could you do me a favor ?
it' s no big deal , what ?
a business associate of my dad' s is gonna come by to pick this up ,

his head' s just a little bloody from where we hit him with the shovel ,
and i swear when tom shot the gun off , he didn' t think it was loaded
' cause i put the bullets back in , so if you' il all just step inside , you' il see there' s nobody dead here ,
he may have had the wind knocked out of him temporarily , but with a little first aid , i think he' il be just fine , ) )
) )
holy mother of god !

) ok , fine ,
) whoa !

he' s manipulating you and you are buying it ,
all right , fine , you do what you gotta do , i am gonna bail tom out of jail ,
with what ?
your drug money ?
no , no , no , i stole this out of dad' s safe ,
look , the important thing is , somebody has gotta help tom ,
you know that nothing that happened here last night was any of his fault ,
it' s funny , the nicest guy in the world' s the only one with enough balls to stand up to dad ,
all he wanted to do was to spend some time with you ,
look what it gets him ,
classic dad , i' m not allowed in the house , you' re not allowed out of it ,
he doesn' t care about us , only that stupid bird ,
hey , red , can i tell you something ?
sure ,
i know this is gonna sound weird , but ever since i was a little kid ,,,
i used to always wish that i was that stupid bird ,
aw , )
look , i think it' s about time you talk to dad ,
at least tell him how you feel , you can do it , ) )
don' t you see , we have no reason to be afraid of him ?
aah !
)
aah !
) aah !
)
daddy !
lisa , don' t let him do this to you ,
lisa !
aah !
lisa !
tom !
red bailed me out ,,, and told me you were here and i' m not letting you go ,
yeah , but i' m ,,, no , you' re gonna let me finish ,
i went through hell last night and it was my fault ' cause i let people do it to me ,
and now you' re gonna make the same mistake ,
yeah , but ,,, this isn' t what you want ,
this is what your father wants , and you know what ?
maybe you and l ,,, never are gonna work , and that hurts ,
but not as much as watching you be controlled by a ruthless tyrant that would screw his own mother if he thought it' d help him get ahead ,,,
tom !
i' m not going ,
she' s she' s not going ,
ls this whole concept too complicated for you , stansfield ?
no , no ,
all right , )
wha ,,, l ,,, what made you stay ?
that ,
how did you guys ,,, we finally had our long overdue talk ,
then then who' s taking your place in thailand ?
he is , )
what' s this ?
) ow !
i' m kidding , i don' t wanna go , i' m afraid ,
nonsense , everyone knows that , uh ,,,
asian people are very intimidated by , uh ,,,
tall men ?
canadians ?
republicans ?
blacks ?
henderson ?
yes , sir ,
i won' t have that kind of thinking in this company ,
there' s no room for racism here , you' re fired ,
now , tom , the point that i' m getting to is that with a big part of the team away ,
i' m gonna want you to take over the creative department ,
me ?
no need to be modest ,
i saw those ideas you left in the living room ,
your theory on the jfk thing , brilliant , and the moon landing , a hoax ?
you' re really on to something there ,
that' s the kind of thinking that' s gonna sell books ,
uh , thank you , sir ,
bye , daddy , have a safe flight ,
well , dad ,,, that' s fantastic , you promoted tom ,
yeah , well , i figure anyone who' s got the guts to piss on my persian carpet has gotta have what it takes , stansfield !
)
what the hell are you doing ?
just trying to get my job back , sir , ( .
if i had $ 1 000000 " by barenaked ladies ))
) ) ) you know , after everything that happened , after all i went through ,
i guess it was my lucky day .
and i' m not the only one .
based on lisa and red' s suggestions ,
jack restructured the company from top to bottom .
even instituting casual fridays every day .
and last friday was henderson' s 2 7th straight day on the job without being fired .
oj' s back off the drugs and now he only drinks beer .
) ) but he still has an occasional flashback .
)
jack begged audrey to come back , but she got a job at , of all places , a coffee shop .
ew !
ugh !
ew !
ew !
this is terrible !
hans succeeded in turning around the company' s factory in thailand .
but apparently he' s still struggling to cope with the local customs .
back of bus !
excuse me ?
you people belong back of bus , that' s an outrage !
man , i' m not gonna let you treat me like that merely because i' m ,,,
smoking !
smokers belong back of bus !
)
as for me , with my new promotion ,
i could at last write books based on my own experiences .
so i did .
thank you ,
and lisa was finally able to pursue a career that she loved .
why does everything bad always happen to me ?
well , i don' t get those people ...
' cause i' ve learned that if they just stop and look around , they' d realize that everything happens for a reason .
( .
if i had $ 1 000000 " by barenaked ladies continues ))
( .
burn the boats " by early edison ))
) i told him he' d see the ass sooner or later .
