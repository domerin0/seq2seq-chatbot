jesus .
chantal ?
shouldn' tyou get that ?
hello ?
henry ?
victor benezet here .
how areyou ?
as well as can be expected under the circumstances .
that' s good .
i' m sorry to call you like this , but i need you to come in .
there' s a charityball tonight .
it' sjust a few questions .
lunderstandwhy you were distressedyesterday ... but we do need to make a proper report .
i' m giving the toast tonight .
and i' m looking forward to it , old boy .
can' t we do this tomorrow , victor ?
it' s a fund raiser .
this' il only take ten minutes .
seeyou at the station , then .
arias .
yes ?
hey , howyou doing ?
tellmeyourspeech won' tbeinsufferablylong .
theywon' t serve dinner until you' re fi nished .
ifyou' re hungry , write a check , because i can crawl all night .
don' t bait henry .
he' s nervous .
henry loves being the center ofattention , don' tyou ?
excuse us , will you ?
yes , go ahead .
i have a position for a good handyman ... in caseyou ever tire ofthese long policeman' s hours .
nothing works around here .
i do appreciateyour coming in on such short notice , henry .
you look marvelous .
just grand .
you getyounger every day .
thankyou , victor .
you met detective owens yesterday at the house .
happy san sebastian toyou .
same toyou , mr. hearst .
i' il burn us some coffee .
nonfat milk ifyou have it .
i don' t think he heard me , actually .
he reminds me a lot ofyou .
only listens when it suits him .
that' s unfair , henry .
not only am i a good listener ... but i keep it all in here .
anyway , we should have this cleared up in no time .
perhaps under the circumstances , i should be calling you " captain .
oh , no .
no need for that formality .
i do apologize about the timing .
i knowyou' re due across the street .
wejust need to clarify some ofthe details from your report .
your superintendent is one ofthe charity' s biggest supporters .
i know , i know .
so ifyou' il help us put an end to some ofthese nagging questions why , we' il haveyou on yourway .
i would' ve thoughtyou' d be at the party already .
you do know how to have fun , don' tyou , victor ?
tuxedo' s all ready to go .
i must say , henry , you seem in high spirits ... what with all this on your doorstep .
how should i behave ?
how' s chantal ?
waiting .
a noble quality in thatyoung woman .
something mine didn' t seem to want to do .
i was sad to hear that .
we always thoughtyou made a charming couple .
charming , perhaps ... but dull , apparently .
you see the children much ?
both ofmy daughters are living with their mother ... back in new york city .
must be hard during the holidays and all .
we should get on with it .
no milk ?
i' m sorry .
no , thanks .
you' re into charity .
why don' tyou fund raise us up a cappuccino machine ... so all the lowlifes that come through here can enjoy a solid cup ofcoffee ?
i wasjust going to ask mr. hearst about the dog .
oh , yeah .
right .
the " mystery dog .
actually , i like " ghost dog .
that' s got a nice ring to it .
can we start again ?
i come in here likeyou ask ... and mr. congeniality here is taking a hostile mannerwith me .
it' s this case , henry .
it has everyone on edge .
but it' sjust
this business is strange ... going bywhat' s in the record .
but let' s see .
here . january 6 .
yesterday afternoon .
you sayyou were ... outjogging with a dog .
yes .
man' s best friend .
belonging to a neighbor ofyours ... named ricardi .
you ever own one ?
when i was a boy , my family had great danes .
butyou don' t own one now ?
chantal prefers cats .
so , doyou have a cat ?
too unsanitary .
chantal would want a cat , but only ifit could be sanitized .
what doyou mean ?
cats are always licking themselves .
i dumped a girlfriend once because ofher damn cat .
thing had me up all night slurping away .
a dog is a lot more unsanitary ... but at least when they' re sleeping , they sleep .
thankyou for that .
anyway , the messiest is a canary .
she refused that too .
but for once i stuck to my guns .
i can be quite fi rm ifi need to be .
what was his name again ?
tango .
doyou write that just like " tango " ?
how else would you write it , like " waltz " or " fox trot " ?
when you were questioned ... you said ...
i discovered the girl .
what we' re not clear about here is what the dog was doing .
so ?
logically , you would expect that the dog would have found the girl .
well , i suppose it did .
butyou sayyou found her .
well , me , the dog we were together .
we found the body .
what difference does it make ?
i called the police .
unless , perhaps , you think the dog called and disguised his voice .
mr. hearst ... twoyoung girls have been found strangled ... within the past 1 6 days .
it is myjob to fi nd the murderer .
you' re a principal witness to the crime scene .
now , i have to make sure that the facts ofyour statements ... agree with the other facts ofthe case .
mr. hearst doesn' t appear to be as distressed today .
i' m a guest here .
i' il be treated with respect , sergeant opie .
owens .
that' s detective owens .
please .
o w  please !
let' s all let' s all relax .
everyone has somewhere else they' d like to be .
now , henry , ifyou don' t mind ... please ... tell us one more time howyou came upon the girl .
ljoggedup to ricardi' s like lalways do .
i grabbed the dog .
better run him a little faster , henry .
he' s getting a belly as round as yours !
fuckin ' old geezer .
come on , boy .
let' s go .
let' s go !
this dog
he was defi nitelywith you ?
what dialect doyou need this in ?
yes , the dog was with me .
the dog was with me .
got it ?
you' re saying tango he was there .
good .
you' re catching on .
tango' s all right .
keeps me company on my runs .
we took the path by my house like always .
suddenlytango wasn' t there .
tango , come on , boy !
i called to him , but he wouldn' t come .
i could hear him .
he was growling , barking ... actingpeculiar .
that' s when i turned back .
i kept calling .
tango , come on , boy .
the dog wouldn' t come .
you couldn' t see the girl at this point ?
obviously not from the path .
but i could see tango in there moving around .
soyou ventured off into the grove .
that' s when i saw her .
at fi rst i thought she was asleep .
she was almost i want to say angelic .
the way shejust lay there .
her eyes theywere dark brown .
theywere still open .
sue ellen huddy .
she was three days shy ofher 1 3th birthday .
how did you discern she was dead ?
i touched her .
i mean , i put my head on her chest .
there was no heartbeat .
that was that .
the dog found the body .
that' s correct .
mr. ricardi states fi rmly that you did not run the dog yesterday .
he admits that on most days you do , but notyesterday .
well , hejust doesn' t remember right .
well , that may be , but in that case , your neighbor ...
miss lazzo , doesn' t remember either .
and another neighbor , mr. irwin , also suffers memory loss .
in the whole area , you' re the only one who remembers correctly .
who am i to believe ?
them , naturally .
come on .
you' re taking this personally .
i' m just trying to fi nd the truth .
you know , you enjoy hounding me .
how is that , henry ?
you forget i know all your tricks .
a murder by some thug or nutcase that' s average .
but when it' s a pillar ofthe legal community ... that' s more than just a witness
then it' s banner headlines , television .
it' d help in your push to become our next police superintendent , right ?
come on , victor .
confess .
see ?
i gotyou .
let' s sayyou' re right .
everything you say .
i bag a prominent attorney ... hang his pelt on the trophywall ofmy new luxurious offices .
what aboutyour neighbors , then ?
areyou saying that they' re all out to getyou too ?
how would i know ?
whywould they be ?
maybe because i' m very rich ?
because i have a big house ... and a glamorous wife .
i have these things , and it happens i don' t deserve them .
my looks are entirely ordinary , and i' m no genius .
mediocre people tolerate success ... when it comes to someone exceptional like a movie star or an athlete ... but when it comes to one oftheir own ... then it strikes them as being an injustice .
you agree ?
i thinkwe' re getting a little far afield .
interesting thing is , there were no dog prints found at the murder scene ... and we know that without the dog ... you neverwould' ve seen the body .
in otherwords , your ghost dog story reeks .
there were dead leaves everywhere .
how doyou make dog prints in dead leaves , detective opie ?
i don' t know .
tell me .
you' re a tax attorney .
good at making up fantasies .
that' s what they payyou for , right ?
the dog was there . jesus .
hold it , now .
hold it .
hold on .
yesterday .
damn .
they' re all correct about tango .
i didn' t pick him up at ricardi' s .
i met him out on the path .
geez .
really had me going there for a sec .
good .
he gets out sometimes , and he runs around the gardens .
halfthe time ...
ricardi doesn' tevenknow he' s missing until lbring him back .
i remember now ... that i called him .
tango , come here , boy .
come on .
youjust went offwith him .
yeah , tango' s my buddy .
aren' tyou ?
go on .
go on .
run .
perhapsyou' il understand howour earsprick up ... every timeyourstory changes .
yes , andlcertainlyhope this one works ... because i' m banking on this lame dog story to get me off the hook .
crap .
how much longer do i gotta put up with this
owens !
you' re out ofline .
good boy .
speaking ofdogs , you keepyours on a leash .
you don' t need a lawsuit .
now , you listen to me , victor .
this is getting ridiculous .
when you called me , you told me it was gonna be ten minutes .
now look at this .
i' m afraid it' s gonna take a little longer .
i can see the notion ofcivic duty and being a good citizen isjust a myth .
i don' t rememberwho said it  you don' t seem to remembervery much .
i don' t rememberwho said the police will ensure public safety everywhere ... except inside a police station .
you called before anyone knew sue ellen was missing .
well , does that make me the murderer ?
it says right here , " i ran home and called the police .
my god , there must have been several places closer .
i wasn' t thinking .
i just ran home .
or maybeyou thought , " i' d betterwash up fi rst .
i don' t likeyour tone .
and frankly , i' m beginning to fi nd yours more and more interesting .
what areyou recording ?
doyou have any idea whyyou' re still here ?
maybeyou should call a lawyer down here .
i am a fucking lawyer !
this isjanuary 7 , 8 : 06 p. m.
sanjuan police headquarters .
i' m captain benezet .
with me is detective owens .
we' re talking to mr. henry hearst .
doyou haveyour permission to tape this interview , henry ?
why not ?
i have nothing to hide .
thankyou .
now , then your name , age , profession and marital status .
come on .
name , age , profession and marital status , please .
youjust said my name .
fine .
whatever .
hearst .
henry buchanan hearst .
i' m 57 .
your house is called " the ilado " up on old sanjuan hill ... and you' re an attorney ?
yes .
senior partnerwith hearst , dean and dumet right here in town .
you must have a lot offancy computers up there in that office .
you ever surfthe net ?
check out the chat rooms and the websites ?
i don' t know about chat rooms , but sure .
what does this have to do with anything ?
any other hobbies ?
computers are not my hobby .
photography is .
i have my own darkroom .
i enjoy chronicling the island' s history .
and you' re married .
yes .
ten years now .
and no children .
yes .
and no children .
why not ?
chantal won' t chantal can' t have children .
she can' t , or she won' t ?
she has a fertility problem .
what difference does it make ?
you ever hear ofadopting ?
you walk somebody else' s dog .
that' s true tact .
that' s very elegant .
doyou think that' s elegant ?
this is what i think .
i remember that you couldn' t afford law school .
i rememberyou waiting on tables .
we' d swagger in , drunk ... trotting along hot looking dolls , spending moneyyou know we didn' t earn .
i think the matter at hand is payback .
that' s what i think .
when detective owens arrived atyour house at 6 : 54 p. m. yesterday ... he noted thatyou were not wearingjogging clothes .
i showered .
beforeyou called ?
ofcourse not .
lcalledas soonas lcamehome .
91 1 .
whatisyour emergency ?
i want to report a dead body .
officers also noted thatyourwife had notyet been told about the girl .
she was in the bedroom .
it says hereyou called from the bedroom .
you had to lie down .
you were distraught .
we' d had an argument .
when you got home ?
no , earlier .
please don' t go into this now , victor .
it' s none ofyour business !
damn it , henry !
chantal was in the bedroom .
she was not .
the dog was with you .
the dog was not .
tell me one thing that adds up ... so we can go across the street and have a good time .
it' s a pity thatyou' ve never been to our home .
then you' d understand .
but i was .
i was there .
downstairs there' s that
upstairs it gets instructive .
there' s nothing real special about it .
mr. hearst didn' t say " special .
he said " instructive .
thankyou .
well , let' s see .
upstairs .
there' s ahallway , right ?
there' s along hallway .
sixty feet .
possibly .
defi nitely .
i count five rooms up here .
the extra bedrooms were for the children , which were never used .
the guest bedroom was redecorated for mywife .
our old room is now mine .
in between ... the hallway .
sixty feet long .
you have separate bedrooms .
my lovely chantal' s affl iction is the green eyed monster .
they say thatjealousy is all the fun you think somebody else is having .
chantal can be unbearable , i promiseyou .
she have reason to be ?
regardless ofwhatyou think ofme , i do love mywife .
i' ve always loved her .
the only thing i everwanted was to be happywith chantal ... and have children .
but the pitter patter oflittle feet ... was not to be .
check those out .
i certainlywould like to .
it certainly pays to advertise .
ben , thomas , i caughtyou in the act .
married men should be more subtle .
where' s henry ?
he' il be right along .
had a business matter to tidy up .
i thought i saw him walking into the police station ... as we drove up to the valet .
he' il be right along .
well , what do we discuss now ?
we' ve pretty much exhausted canaries and dogs .
let' s talk about the fi rst murder , ifyou don' t mind , down in la perla .
happenednot toolong ago , justovertwo weeks .
little girl' s body was found .
paulina valera .
twelveyears old .
poorislandgirl .
mother was astreethooker living in amotelnot too faraway .
we thinkitstarted somewhere in thestreets .
paulina was luredorsheran .
either way , thekiller leftherbodyin the dump .
yeah ?
tell him i' il be right out .
when i get back , henry ...
i wantyou to tell me what you were doing in la perla ... the night paulina valera was killed .
superintendent .
i' m waiting to introduce good citizen henry hearst ... in , let' s see , 29 minutes .
and i' m told he' s still in there .
that' s right .
victor , doyou realize how important this fund raising event is ?
yes , we have two dead girls .
but we also have countless children ... whose homes were blown away in the hurricane .
we have open sewers .
we have a cholera epidemic .
sir , i realize
you obviously do not .
how will the sponsors react if henry' s accused ?
i imagine extremely grateful that their children are safe .
just have him across the street ... by 9 : 00 , okay ?
what timeyou got ?
time to go .
your pulse is racing .
i' m due to give my speech !
speech ?
yes , i know .
i' ve been told .
two patrol officers wrote down the license plate number ... ofyour range rover , which was parked in the vicinity ofthe crime scene .
your expensive vehicle attracted attention .
officers thought it might be stolen , called it in .
that puts you in the area , henry .
anytimeyou' re ready .
me , i' m just hoping this is as good as ghost dog .
you know whereyou were three weeks ago , sergeant opie ?
i was right here serving coffee to stand up citizens likeyourself .
i was at my sister in law' s .
i had knocked back a few at the club ... andlhadthis inspiration to drop off some christmas gifts forthekids .
nameandaddress , henry .
ldon' tknowthe exactaddress , butlknow where itis .
it' s maria andpaco rodriguez .
should be in the book .
chantal' s older sister .
greatkids .
how areyou ?
fine .
maria' s done a fabulousjob with them .
merry christmas .
why didn' t chantal go with you ?
it' s her sister .
it' s complicated .
paco .
merry christmas .
i need to know more about this .
no , you don' t .
i talkedtoher .
she gave up a little bit ofdirt .
she says that it' s the fi rst time ... that either henry or chantal ... had stopped by in a long time .
she didn' t sound too friendly .
whyyou pick that night to thaw the ice ?
it has nothing to do with anything .
where' d you go next ?
i went home .
police reported your car at 2 : 1 8 a. m.
you see , this is what we here at the police
we call it a window ofopportunity .
i was driving drunk .
i wasjust driving terribly .
lmostdefinitelyneeded to walk offtheliquor .
la perla' s not a good idea for a man wearing armani .
it was abeautifulnight .
this place doesn' t scare me .
well , it should .
so ?
where did you go ?
lfoundabench .
lsatdown .
lfoundabench .
lsatdown . lfellasleep .
found a bench .
woke up i don' t know when .
felt better .
i went home .
what' s gonna stop me from shoving my fist down his throat ?
the police would rather that i drove home drunk ?
all right , henry .
let' s revisit this ... bench later .
first i want an answer to my question ... as to why chantal didn' t accompanyyou that night .
it' s between the sisters .
lmetpaco rodriguez .
he' s ahotlocalartist .
busted him once smoking grass .
who doesn' t on this island ?
you smoke a little grass , henry ?
doyou ?
god knows it would help with your sunny disposition .
i' m thinking you don' t fancy chantal hanging out ... with a handsome , successful younger man .
doyou ?
is this necessary ?
how old was chantal when you married her ?
twenty .
right , henry ?
you' re , what , 67 , right ?
i' m 57 !
goddamn it , 57 !
this is a fucking outrage .
you know that ?
you' ve no right to pry into my private affairs ... with these soap opera insinuations .
look atyou , victor .
doing a bang upjob policing the island .
drugs everywhere .
just crime is rampant .
superintendent , my butt .
you' il be lucky ifyou still have ajob .
i' m sorry .
i' m really sorry .
this is really rather unbearable for me .
i don' t suppose that ...
detective owens could get me a cold drink .
ifyou would , detective .
my pleasure .
all right , henry .
what' s going on here ?
doyou have anything ... a little stronger stashed away around here ?
okay , victor .
what' s itgonna take togetme outofhere ?
we both know that i could march in an army ofattorneys .
i' m intrigued they' re not here already , henry .
you' re hiding something , something you don' t want to get outside this room .
now it' sjustyou and me .
tell me about chantal .
you tell me about kate and consuelo .
ifhaving a difficult marriage makes me a murderer ... you' d be son ofsam .
touche .
kate and i ... married tooyoung .
she grew to want somebody better .
a man with a real job ... money to buy things she came to know ... that other men were only too happy to buy for her .
and consuelo
consuelojust hates me being a cop .
you stuckwith your guns .
you can' t tell me being a cop isn' t exciting .
and you obviously enjoy harassing people .
you don' t see folks running up to me at cocktail soirees saying ...
gee whiz , a tax attorney .
wow .
what a cool job .
wish i could do that .
wouldn' t mind whatyou got , henry .
used to be enough .
chantal' s green monster ... extends to her sister' s marriage .
you see , maria married for other more tried and true reasons ... despite her mother' s objections .
married a man closer to her own age .
a man ofmodest means .
dashing young artist .
beautiful women .
they are a breed unto themselves .
wouldn' tyou agree ?
a beautiful woman moves through life unchallenged ... men giving them everything that theywant .
first their daddies , then their boyfriends and husbands .
i' il drink to that .
for some , beauty is their only talent .
there' s always somebody more beautiful .
somebodyyounger .
chantal' s mother taught her that .
why areyou doing this to me , victor ?
i certainly hopeyou' ve gotten your petty thrill pulling back the curtain .
but there' s nothing more to see .
i' il tell you what i see , henry .
i see the bodies oftwoyoung girls , murdered .
the man who did that' s going to answer to me .
you make me sick .
why doyou keep saying " the man who did it ... the one responsible , the killer " ?
why don' tyou put a name to this phantom
henry hearst , attorney at law ifyou' re so convinced that i' m guilty ?
construing my marriage to be dysfunctional ... just makes it easier foryou to sell me down the river .
i' m being convinced , but not all the way .
that' s whyyou' re still here .
i' m still here because i choose to be .
becauseyou asked me ifi would " drop by .
becauseyou fed me this line ofcrap ... about a couple ofquestions .
but now now i' m leaving .
i' ve told my story to exhaustion .
i' ve got a ballroom full ofpeople waiting for me over there ... to give my toast in exactly 1 2 minutes .
and i' ve suffered enough insults and accusations for any friend to bear .
and i' ve suffered enough insults and accusations for any friend to bear .
you' re not going anywhere , henry .
what , areyou gonna sick this knuckle dragger on me ?
in that case , be careful .
be very careful , because you only have so many possibilities .
i know something about the law .
i' m gonna walk right out that door unless you book me here and now .
how about i detain you on suspicion ?
areyou serious ?
read him his rights .
step inside .
you have the right to remain silent .
anything you say can and will be  on what charge ?
taking a nap on a bench ?
walking a dog without permission ?
two counts , fi rst degree murder .
special circumstances .
two counts , rape ... upon the persons ofsue ellen huddy and paulina valera .
i raped them as well , huh ?
ifyou cannot afford an attorney , the court will appoint one foryou .
now , doyou understand these rights that have been explained toyou ?
seeyou outside a minute , please .
he' s one hundred fucking percent guilty .
he knows exactlywhere we' re taking him .
yeah , you made sure ofthat .
thankyou .
now , what ifhe lawyers up ?
he opens his wallet and trots in some hardball mouthpiece
that' s it .
we lose him .
we already had him .
i was sleeping on a park bench .
i mean , my ass !
you' re playing it soft .
why areyou butterballing him ?
why don' tyou let me go in there and let me drop the hammer on that guy ?
i' m gonna walk across the street .
you go back in there , and you sit with him .
and you keepyour mouth shut .
okay ?
shut !
i saw victor' s eyes .
and your nostrils seem to have a new flare to them .
as in , your butt got chewed for blowing the pooch .
our notorious captain would love to have ambushed me with that tidbit ... and owned the most devastating moment .
yeah .
you okaywith that ?
what ?
i didn' t know diet or regular .
bet they' re fast , huh ?
excuse me ?
little girls .
i bet they run really fast ... when you' re chasing ' em .
you' il be running quick , too , when i fi le my lawsuit .
you' re telling me toletaman whom i think in all probability ... killed twoyoung girls walk out ofthe station ?
for ten minutes , victor .
has he confessed ?
ofcourse not .
you have proofenough to arrest him ?
i' ve caught him in a number oflies .
you need more than a few lies .
and until you have them ...
i don' t want him retained officially .
don' t tell meyou already
five minutes ago .
i thought he might take off .
he has to make his toast !
bring him here .
no uniformed officer .
no restraint ofany kind .
see to it ...
captain .
well , this is nice .
a little alone time .
you know , i likeyou , henry .
can you believe it ?
a couple ofgirls strangled , raped .
and yetyou maintain a sense ofhumor about it .
raped and strangled .
what ?
you said " strangled and raped .
i wouldn' t know , especially ... but these things should be put in their proper order .
don' tyou agree , detective ?
doyou call to them ?
what do i know ?
could be the poor kids , they lured you ... off into the woods and seduced you .
it happens .
you sound obsessed .
you like this sort ofthing .
i' m just curious .
i' m curious howyou operate .
now ... these little girls i bet they run like rabbits , don' t they ?
come on .
tell me about it .
what doyou do ?
touch ' em ?
you touch ' em like that ?
what , did that hurt ?
you hurt ' em , don' tyou ?
the little girls .
doyou kiss them ?
cut it out !
what' s your name , sweetheart ?
paulina ?
that' s a pretty name .
it' s sexy , yeah .

i am too .

it' s a tight little blouse you got on there .
god , you' re a hot little cutie .
i just wanna put my

he has aspeech tomake .
when you' ve fixed your rug , i gotta run you over .
haven' tyou done that already ?
would you please getyour hands off me ?
please !
my god , henry !
what happened ?
haveyou met my new tailor and hairstylist ... the " marquis de fucking sade " ?
look !
this is nothing less than assault and battery , and i have witnesses !
witnesses to what ?
you knocked me down the stairs !
you attempted to escape !
that' s bullshit !
come on !
let' s go have a serious discu  just cut the crap .
what ?
henry , people are depending on you .
shut up . just shut up .
shut up, julio .
doyou mind ?
ruthanne , you' re looking lovely , as usual .
henry , is everything okay ?
yes , fi ne .
thankyou very much .
it' s all right .
isabella , hola .
wait .
just pray that i' m guilty ofkilling those girls ... because ifi am , then your boys worked over a monster .
it' il be brushed under the carpet .
but ifl' m not , the monster changes sides .
henry , just give us that money smile .
shit .
good evening , ladies and gentlemen .
happy san sebastian .
i' m proud to introduce a man ... who along with his lovelywife chantal hearst ... has championed many charity causes in puerto rico .
and in the wake of hurricane lucy , we need him more than ever .
so , henry , get over here and empty these people' s pockets .
where' s his fucking hair ?
had the damn thing upside down .
thankyou very much for coming tonight .
whereyou been ?
got a lot ofcatchin ' up to do .
i' m right behind you .
when nature sends its worst , it' s as ifone ofgod' s checks has bounced .
let' s prayyour checks don' t .
because that' s whywe' re here .
hurricane lucy ripped across
they say no amount oflearning can cure stupidity .
you' re certainly a candidate for  ifhe' d cracked , you' d have come back
well , he didn' t crack , and you' re off this investigation .
what ?
don' t , detective .
learn the grammar ofsilence whileyou still hold that rank .
now , you go back to the station .
go home .
put on a silly hat .
do whatever morons do .
the island is a family , one that has been torn apart .
we need to be there for each other , especially for our children .
for there' s no greater gift than a child' s smile .
i want him back .
now .
tonight .
not tomorrow .
victor , don' t underestimate ... the resolve of henry hearst and his law fi rm ... to raiseyour severed head on a pole ... and wave it for the whole damn island to see .
we' il see whose head gets waved on that pole .
well , that' s your decision , then ... isn' t it ?
in closing , i' d like to askyou to look intoyour hearts ... realize what truly matters in life ... and fi nd the love to help our family .
perhaps catastrophe ... is the natural human environment .
we fi nd ourselves attacked by unforeseen forces come to harm us ... even though we are innocent ofanywrongdoing .
but it is human nature to overcome , ifwe work together .
so , please , help me help the children .
thankyou .
you know , as ifi wasn' t embarrassed enough ... youjerked me out ofthere without being able to chat or have dinner .
i' m hungry , damn it !
you like chocolate ?
there' s a whole machine full ofit in the hallway ... and i knowyou' ve got money .
you can' t treat me like this .
ofcourse i can !
you' il eat , henry .
food is the least ofyour problems .
i' m going to do the best i can to seeyou get three squares a day .
come with me .
will you hold my husband all night ?
how long could that be ?
would you like to have a private chat with yourwife ?
this is detective castillo .
he' s going to set up a video camera in here while i chat with chantal .
why mustyou question her ?
detective castillo will getyou some food .
i should tell you the  do it outside .
victor , i need to know what' s happening .
just give me a moment while i close the door .
she came in she was to me
is henry here ?
can i see him ?
i need to see him .
doesn' t want to talk toyou .
ifhe' s innocent , why is this taking so long ?
i never said he was innocent .
tell me aboutyour lives together as a couple .
you could start with the separate bedrooms .
he talked about that ?
and what else ?
your sister .
don' tyou offer to light a lady' s cigarette ?
tell me about the night he ... visited your sister' s home .
what night would that be ?
december 1 9 , sunday night , about 9 : 00 in the evening .
i fi nd it curious thatyou chose not to accompany him .
i wasn' t aware henry had visited my sister .
whywouldn' t he tell you ?
obviously henry has talked to us aboutyour marriage ... howyou wish you had married someone closer toyour age , like paco .
you' re saying henry' sjealous ofmy sister' s husband ?
areyou having an affair with paco ?
am i on trial now ?
can you tell me what time he got home that night ?
there was a night that could be it .
lrememberthe frontdoor .
it' s old , veryheavy .
it tends to slam .
did you look at the clock ?
you must' ve been worried .
this wasn' t the fi rst time .
hello ?
take me into that room .
why don' tyou answer me ?
andyoudidn' tpursueit ? or didn' t youcare toask where he was ?
we don' t ask those sort ofquestions anymore .
but i' m sure you' re going to tell me .
we have reason to believe he was in la perla ... where a young girl named paulina valera was raped and murdered ... and left on a garbage dump .
i need to know whose name the house is in .
the house was a gift .
then may i haveyour permission to search the house ?
you may not .
you said you were hungry .
what' d she say ?
you all set , castillo ?
yes , sir .
start recording .
i was talking toyou .
that' s right .
victor only listens when it suits victor .
i listen , henry .
i was listening when you told me you left your sister in law' s ... and drove to la perla , thatyou went for a walk and fell asleep on a bench .
now i' d like to hear something that vaguely resembles the truth .
that is the truth .
chantal says you got home at 3 : 30 a. m.
i told you i went for a walk .
i was drunk .
i
i may have had another drink .
you happen onto via del mar boulevard ?
doyou want toparty with me ?
whatdoyou want ?
did you see any hookers ?
no .
you didn' t talk to any hookers ?
no .
spend time with one , perhaps ?
absolutely not .
you' re lying , henry .
your carotid artery is pumping like crazy .
and your eyes they turn down and to the left .
that' s what liars do .
it' s a fact .
our bodies give us away .
doyou know what these do ?
they keep me awake .
i haven' t been sleeping much .
sinceyou found sue ellen huddy' s body , i' ve been working straight through .
and i' ve got so much to share with you .
for instance , i accompanied those two officers ... who phoned in the license number from your range rover .
we went back to la perla .
they showed me exactlywhereyou parked .
we conducted some interviews .
imagine my surprise when several prostitutes recognized your photo ... said you' d been coming around for months .
jesus christ , victor , she' s in the next room .
i' m talking about street hookers , needle users , crackheads ... not high class call girls .
curb crawlers , for god' s sake .
my god .
that old carotid artery is pumping like gangbusters .
god damn you .
chantal can' t hearyou , not with the door closed .
unless i turn the speaker on .
please .
she was blond .
obviously peroxide , being hispanic .
she would truly have been beautiful without all that makeup .
i never knew her name .
doyou miss me , huh ?
yes , you do .
i left my sister in law' s house ... to have sex in an alley with a prostitute .
i be a good little girl foryou .
little girl .
i fi nished myselfoff ... drinking any goddamn thing i wanted at the sunshine cafe .
a whiskey .
what doyou think ?
that i' d spend my life banging on mywife' s mywife' s door ?
i' d fi nd a substitute ... someonejust the opposite from chantal .
a prostitute is a woman who will giveyou a great deal ... for relatively little money .
well , as an alibi , i don' t know , henry .
a lot ofwomen in puerto rico die their hair blond ... especially in that profession , but i' il tell you what i do know .
one ofthem admittedshe' dbeen withyou last week .
hername was reina .
doyou know this man ?
no .
yes .
she was young , much younger than the others .
and she says that' s whyyou like her .
but this must be an old picture .
why ?
the guy' s bald now .
bald ?
mm hmm .
you removeyour hairpiece down there as well , don' tyou , henry ?
it seems nobody remembers you with the rug .
trying not to be recognized .
that' s smart .
pick ' em up inyour car , somebodymightcatch alicenseplate .
" this one likes it quick "  from behind .
he pumps me hard .
at least he comes fast .
then goes like he doesn' t want to be here .
but i like it fast .
gets me back
... into my corner .
but a week ago is no alibi , is it , henry ?
why , henry ?
why here like this ... in the dirt ?
think ofthehigh class escorts youcanbuy .
suites at the ritz .
dom perignon .
and you choose this .
don' t tell her , will you , victor ?
please .
i imagine chantal will be thrilled to learn you were with a prostitute ... instead ofwhat you were really doing .
rapists leave bodily fluids semen ...
dna .
your test' il prove that it wasn' t me .
you use condoms with your prostitutes ?
ofcourse .
what kind ?
i don' t know .
trojans .
whatever they have .
the killer used condoms .
chemical lubricants were found in the victims .
he' s smart , likeyou .
knows all about our lab tests .
both victims were rapedfrom behind .
both victims were strangledfrom behind .
thumbandfingerprints on the victims' necks confirmedthis .
areyou here all byyourself ?
then you put the clothes back on .
dirtandleaves inside thegarments confirmedthis , as well .
prettyblouseyouhave on there .
then you pose them .
each on theside ...
little heads resting on cupped hands .
and you combed their hair .
the lack ofdebris suggests this .
and we have reason to believeyou took their photograph .
stop it !
photography is your hobby , isn' t it ?
isn' t it ?
stop it !
what' s wrong ?
you all right ?
i' m fi ne .
what' s wrong ?
you all right ?
i' m fi ne .
you want some water ?
no .
i' m perfectly fi ne .
i' ve never been better .
i' m just tired .
you don' t look exactly fresh as a daisyyourself .
you surf , henry ?
the internet ?
this is a statement from yourweb browser provider .
your e mail address is hhearst@ elpuerto . com .
you sometimes use an on line alias . " hard body hank " ?
very catchy .
god , does this ever end ?
a simpleyes or no , henry .
yes .
yes .
it seems that hard body hank has visited several pornography sites ... one ofwhich is called barely legal .
it features young ladies posed as schoolgirls .
that website features women , not children .
christ .
every time i check e mail , there' s a new message from some electronic bimbo ...
luring me to her site .
so i checked it out a few times .
what' s the big deal ?
and the prostitutes what does that prove ?
that i' m lonely ?
that i don' t get it at home ?
that mywife makes me sleep down the hall ?
and all this makes me a pedophile , a rapist , a killer ofchildren ?
whywould i do such a thing ?
i don' t know , henry .
notyet .
let' s talk about this glamorous wife who keeps poor henry shivering in the hall .
you know what chantal says ?
she' s lying !
whatever she said .
i never touched camille .
who' s camille ?
all right , mrs. hearst .
let' s talk aboutyour separate bedrooms .
henry says it was his choice ; he moved out .
he' s wrong .
he' s wrong or he' s lying ?
let' s not quibble overwords .
but words can be very amusing .
words like " conjugal duty , " for instance ... which henry claims you have not been performing with willing good spirits .
to be honest , he says you' re not performing at all .
he has been revealing things , hasn' t he ?
i' d like to hearyour side .
the most interesting things those i' m sure he kept to himself .
not camille , i' m afraid .
that is the reason you sent him down the hall with his toothbrush and washcloth ?
he' s out there ... afraid , hoping for a miracle ... that one day things will turn out all right ... as long as nobody speaks ofthem .
he' s right to .
to what ?
hope ?
to be afraid .
christmas day , twoyears ago .
we always used to spend christmas with maria and paco .
ofcourse this was before .
yeah .
that' s what i understand .
i couldn' t wait to see my niece .
camille .
their children were special ... with an extra share ofmagic ... andgraceandpurity .
camille was one ofthem .
henryandl were extremely fondofher .
how areyou ?
they seem very close .
don' t they ?
you look great !
you too .
we were allhaving agoodtime , the way families shouldbeat christmas .
but then henrygotdrunk .
red , anybody ?
no , thanks .
you' ve already poured it out .
i have .
he startedmaking remarks ...
please excuse my husband . aboutmeandpaco .
excuse the husband , yeah .
something paco seems very adept at .
it was embarrassing .
henry .
i was angry .
this the fi rst time ?
no .
ls itsomekindofsecret thatpaco finds my chantalenchanting ?
henry , don' t .
so what did you do ?
don' t what ?
i told him to shut up .
just don' t .
afterdinner ...
maria and i opened our presents .
books forme ...
thanks . she wantedtoread ... andjewelry forher thatl wantedto wear .
why i got up when i did , i don' t know .
unless youcallintuitionareason .
but he wasn' t there .
something ledme toward thebedrooms .
i don' t get it .
come here .
theywere there ...
let me see . in herroom .
yes .
thankyou .
he was talking , andshe was listening .
lcouldn' t tellyou whathe was saying ... but the wayhe talkedtoher ... was the way you talk toa woman .
lrememberhowshesmiled , thelookin hereyes .
he had no right to make her smile that way .
and you continued to stay together ... each atyour own separate ends ofthe hall .
and you never had sex since ?
you' re putting on quite a show for henry , aren' tyou ?
right now , he can' t hearyou .
once a woman decides that' s it' s not important
even when i would try toget things back tonormal ... that image was always with me .
and sinceyou can' t have children
ofcourse i can .
would you mind telling me how old you were when you and henry met ?
i think i was about 1 1 when we came over from europe .
henry became my father' s attorney here .
they sailed together .
he was always around .
in our families , you could always fi nd some friend ofyour father' s ... with a boat in st. thomas or a penthouse in manhattan .
and that man was henry .
now , your father
he died when you were what ?
fourteen .
and henry becameyour surrogate father ?
he paid for my college .
and that' s when you became lovers ?
i wasn' t interested in boys my age .
spring break .
i couldn' t wait .
we did it on henry' s yacht , then in hotels ... in cars , on beaches , everywhere .
he was different with me .
he was tender .
we had a time , henry and i.
i can imagine .
so can you imagine his anger ... at not being able to make love toyou now ?
i' ve seen it .
you' ve seen it ?
as in , he raped you ?
rape is an act ofanger .
it' s about control , not about sex .
henrywas a very angry man .
doyou think he' s guilty ?
doyou ?
that night , he visited your sister' s home .
did you notice any scratches on him , signs ofstruggle ?
i can' t remember .
i need to get my hands on the clothes he was wearing that night .
please .
give me permission to search your house .
becauseyou sawyour husband talking toyour niece on christmas eve ... you' ve thrown him out ofyour bedroom and haven' t slept with him in twoyears .
now , don' tyou think that' s a little bit harsh ?
stop trying to bait me .
what doyou call a beautiful young woman who' sjealous ofher 1 3 year old niece ?
honest . " honest . " i don' t know who' s more fucked up , you or him .
i' m sorry .
but don' tyou want to know you' ve been right about him ?
don' tyou ?
don' t make a mess .
castillo ?
take a squad ofmen .
escort mrs. hearst back to her house .
yes , sir .
castillo , search the house .
yes , sir .
say it .
go on .
say it .
she tells you about camille , everything falls into place .
there' s no need to even ask my side ofthe story .
i' mjack the ripper , jekyil and hyde , big , bad wolf .
i' il remind you , henry .
i' ve heard your story all night , and you' ve been lying .
detective .
you got a problem ?
huh ?
all right .
let' s go .
sitdown , henry .
sitdown , henry .
going man to man now , are we ?
shall i roll up my sleeves ?
christmas .
twoyears ago .
you and camille .
letmesee .
ldon' tgetit .
it was nothing , absolutelynothing .
camille draggedmeintoherroom toshow offa christmas gift from hermother .
evenaknuckleheadshouldbeable to  she was high onasugarrush ... frompumpkinpie .
this would look good on you .
couldn' tkeep still .
smile .
so chantal overreacted ?
chantal never letyou touch her after that ?
infidelity ... money , long illness .
i' m separated from mywife by a hallway , a 60 foot hallway .
ln fact , it' s a desert , thathallway .
andat the very end , there' s a door .
and when it' s locked , you can knock all you want ... but thatdoor won' topen .
why doyouholdon ?
whynotjustgeta divorce ?
just trade one nightmare for another .
let' s add it up : halfmy money , the house .
i' d end up living over somebody' s reconverted garage .
oh , yeah , and then there' s half my share ofthe law fi rm .
that' s bullshit , henry .
it' s vanity , pure and simple .
being with her puts you on everybody' s a list .
you' re puerto rico' s glamour couple .
ah !
henry and chantal hearst !
they' re so in love !
just full ofcompliments , aren' t we ?
that' s whyyou stay married .
at our age , fi nding anotherwoman like that' s not so easy .
not so easy ifyou' re taking them back ... toyour third floorwalk up piece ofshit $500 a month studio apartment .
is that whatyou mean , victor ?
well , we can' t all afford ... to wine and dine classy , sophisticated ladies we meet in la perla , can we ?
just who' d yourwife fi nd you with before she relocated in such a hurry ?
fuckyou , henry .
whoops .
tell me .
sue ellen huddy .
did you know herwell orjust in passing ?
not well .
notatall .
it' s impossible foramanmyage toknowa 12 year oldreally well .
to knowa 12 year oldreally well .
bags .
throw me the bags .
thanks .
the darkroom .
there was no dog in there .
there was onlyyou .
we don' thave any evidence ofastruggle ... so it had to be somebody very good with children ... or someone she knew .
did you kick the ball around with her , henry ?
did you laugh and play with her fi rst ?
or did youjust take her ?
was itas exciting as paulina valera ?
tell me , henry !
go to hell .
you dressed her again .
you posed her .
we' il fi nd the brush , henry .
we' il fi nd the brush you used .
we' il fi nd the brush you used to get her hairjust right .
your trophy .
youmet chantal whenshe was 1 1 .
youmoldedapleasure model .
ls that whatyou think childrenare for ?
topleasureyou ?
you peel my onion down to the nub .
areyou trying to tell me thatyou don' t like them young ?
you' re twice divorced , single with a vengeance .
who doyou talk to in a martini bar ?
the best looking girl you can get awaywith , that' s who .
and she' s not 50 .
probably mid 30s .
ofcourse , in their 20s hey .
now we' re talking .
and how about teenage girls ?
we loved them then .
why should anything change now ?
what does he possibly see in a girl thatyoung ?
what in the world do they talk about ?
ifi want to discuss the s& p 500 , i' il call my broker .
young girls don' t talk .
they laugh .
they live .
they' re in the moment .
and every night is the night .
and their bodies are hard and tight ... and smooth ... the way skin is supposed to be .
and saying so ... doesn' t make me a pervert .
men can' t say shit anymore .
we' re all browbeaten byyouth obsessed old bitches fresh from chemical peels .
still want us to open their doors , pay theirway .
yes , victor , i loveyoung women .
at least i' m honest enough to say so .
one hundred fucking percent guilty .
owens .
we found them , sir .
she come backwith you ?
yeah .
put her in there .
all right .
all right , but only ifyou promise to keepyour mouth shut until i' m ready .
you' re welcome .
you can sit right here .
check the recorder .
there should be enough tape ... though i don' t think we' il need much more .
have a seat , henry .
she' s in there watching ?
what' s he saying ?
you' re good athiding behindthings .
sitdown , henry ... andtell us onemore timeaboutyour relationship with thesecondvictim ...
sue ellen huddy .

she thinks that i did this .
i' ilask the question onemore time .
what was your relationship to the murdered girl , sue ellen huddy ?
there was none .
none ?
no .
none .
i saw her by the house on occasion .
shelivedin theneighborhood .
i might have spoke to her once or twice ... ifever .
a greeting , per perhaps .
here' s what i believe , henry .
you' re bored .
you' re unhappy .
you have a history with veryyoung girls .
you' ve been placed at the scene ofthe fi rst murder .
your attempt at an alibi was to kill a second young girl .
you' re in love with someone who doesn' t loveyou ... just whoyou were .
you' re very , very lonely .
i' il tell you what i believe ... whatlknow ... whatlhaveproofof .
can you tell me who that is ?
sue ellen .
aportraitlike that takes time , henry .
and this little girl ?
chantal was nice enough to bring these out ofyour darkroom .
youmakelovelyphotographs , henry .
i can' t believe that she would go these lengths ...
to make this kind ofpoint .
it' s almost farcical .
you killed sue ellen huddy .
yes .
and paulina valera ?
yes .
both ofthem ?
yes , both ofthem .
raped and murdered them .
i' m the one .
areyouprepared tomakeastatement ?
