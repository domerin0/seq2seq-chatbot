i' m not dumb enough to come back "
walter finch .
" will .
will dormer , what are you doing ?
i try to help and you' re running around like a maniac .
were you gonna kill me ?
how would you explain that ?
no one gets too upset when child murderers are brought in feet first .
there' s no evidence i killed kay .
you know because i told you .
" come on .
what' s wrong with you ?
guess i' m a little cranky .
lack of sleep .
" get some rest , will you ?
got some pills , and my bed' s nice and comfy .
another night up and you' il lose it .
hallucinating , babbling .
tomorrow when you feel better , we' il meet in public .
we' il sort it out .
there' s a ferry north of nightmute .
i' il be on the 11 : 00 .
and before you leave , could you feed the dogs ?
they' re on a diet .
dormer ?
fax from the lab .
weapon was a . 38 smith & wesson .
we found something that might  i found this .
at the connells ' .
and ?
it' s the author of the book we found in kay' s bag .
it' s signed by the author .
he' s a local .
kay had all his books .
we should check it out .
small stuff , right ?
yeah .
sure , sure .
nice work , ellie .
she' s got sharp eyes , huh ?
you bet your ass she does .
good stuff .
what a view .
i' m not who you think i am .
no ?
lousy writer .
lonely freak .
murderer .
no ?
when i was 7 , my grandmother took me to portland .
we were walking along and two guys snatched her purse .
a police officer came to ask questions .
he stood the whole time .
uniform looked brand new .
shoes , badge were polished .
it was like a soldier , only better .
i respect your profession .
i write about it .
i wanted to become a cop after school .
i couldn' t pass all the tests .
you should' ve tried internal affairs .
they' d have taken you .
what do you want from me ?
after kay died , i knew everyone would think i meant to do it .
so i cleaned the body , removed all evidence connecting it to me .
except for your fucking novel .
you don' t always see the wood for the trees .
you , for one , should have figured that out by now .
when i heard they had brought somebody from l. a. , i panicked .
i knew the locals would connect me to kay eventually .
i could handle them .
they never look in the eyes of a killer .
killing changes you .
you know that .
it' s not guilt .
i never meant to do it .
it' s like awareness .
life is so important .
how could it be so fucking fragile ?
you' d see it right away , wouldn' t you ?
you trying to impress me ?
because you got the wrong guy .
killing that girl made you feel special .
but you' re not .
you' re the same pathetic freak i' ve been dealing with for 30 years .
know how many of you i caught with your pants down ?
i never touched her like that .
you wanted to .
now you wish you had .
best you could do is clip her nails .
now you' re so different .
you don' t get it , do you ?
you' re my job .
you' re what i' m paid to do .
you' re about as mysterious to me as a toilet is to a plumber .
reasons for doing what you did ?
who gives a fuck ?
motivations are everything , will .
what did you see through the fog ?
i saw pretty clearly , didn' t i ?
i saw you take aim ...
forget it . ... shoot your partner in the chest .
i heard him say , " get away from me ! " why ?
anything to do with internal affairs investigation ?
all that tension in your department ?
you think i' m that easy ?
i' m saying that' s how it looks .
maybe even how it feels .
how did it feel when you found out it was hap ?
guilt ?
relief ?
suddenly , you' re free and clear .
did you think about it before that moment ?
what would it be like if he wasn' t there anymore ?
doesn' t mean you did it on purpose .
you figure if you got something on me , then i' il just roll over ?
protect my reputation ?
no .
protect your life' s work .
the scumbags you put away will be back on the street before you go on trial .
with hap gone , you' re free and clear .
why mess with that ?
kay connell .
remember her ?
it' s your choice .
think of all the other kay connells .
do the math .
you' re a pragmatist .
you have to be because of your job .
this isn' t easy , but i want you to understand ... ... we' re in the same situation here .
you didn' t mean to kill hap any more than i meant to kill kay .
but that' s hard for them to believe , so that' s why we need each other .
we gotta find a patsy for the connell case and make it stick .
then you go back to los angeles and i can go back to living my life .
so , what do you need from me ?
what do they know about me ?
they found a signed copy of one of your books at kay' s house .
so you' il be brought in for questioning .
at the station ?
that' s what they usually do .
brought in for questioning .
i can write that easily .
calm down .
it' s no big thing .
it' s preliminary inquiry , so ... ... just tell the truth .
tell them about randy  why are you talking about randy ?
talk about your relationship with kay .
you can' t hide it , so just say it .
randy is none of your business .
it' s not your affair .
shouldn' t i tell them she was unhappy
tell them she was unhappy , but let them find randy themselves .
that way , they' il make it stick .
understand ?
we need a wild card .
a wild card ?
yeah .
something that' s there .
something we can use .
it' s in every good detective novel .
you still have the . 38 ?
no .
really ?
that' s a shame .
we could use that .
that' d be very convincing for them .
this is my stop .
dormer !
wild card !
night , everyone .
night , francis .
working some overtime ?
nice .
cracking some big cases ?
night .
night , guys .
this is always the worst time of night for me .
too late for yesterday , too early for tomorrow .
sorry about the tape .
i had to make sure you' d follow through .
i' il follow through .
i' ve been thinking it over .
i should tell them about randy .
i think that' s a bad idea .
" but he' s the patsy .
he deserves it .
you should have heard the shit kay told me .
but these are cops .
they' re not children .
you don' t throw things like that in their lap .
i' il push them toward randy .
when the time is right .
we don' t have the gun .
how will we convince them he' s guilty ?
did you keep the dress ?
the dress ?
kay' s dress , nail clippings .
what did you do with those ?
that' s great .
the dress .
we could use that .
even better than the gun .
where could he have taken her ?
" where' d you take her ?
she died in the cabin , right ?
yeah .
where' d you take her to clean her up ?
don' t think about that .
this is tough enough for you .
it was an accident .
yeah .
i didn' t mean to kill her , you know .
i know , but what happened ?
she called and said that she and randy had had a fight .
she wanted to come over and talk , and i said , " meet me at our place .
that' s the cabin at the beach .
she comes over .
she' s distraught and a little drunk .
she starts telling me about how randy and tanya were carrying on .
i only wanted to comfort her .
hold her .
i kissed her , and got a little excited ... ... and she started laughing at me .
she wouldn' t stop laughing .
ever had someone laugh at you when you' re like that ?
vulnerable .
laughing their ass off ?
someone you thought respected you ?
you ever have that happen ?
i just wanted to stop her laughing .
and then , you know ... ... i hit her .
couple of times , to stop her .
get a little respect .
randy did it all the time .
she liked it when he did it .
she never blamed him .
never wanted to leave him .
i do it , she starts screaming .
she wouldn' t stop .
she' s screaming .
i put my hand over her mouth .
then i' m really scared .
i' m scared shitless .
more scared than i' ve ever been .
i' m more scared than her .
and then ... ... everything was clear .
there was no turning back .
and after that , i was calm .
real calm .
you and i share a secret .
we know how easy it is to kill somebody .
that ultimate taboo .
it doesn' t exist outside our minds .
i didn' t murder her .
i killed her , but it just ended up that way .
so where' d you take the body ?
thanks for listening to me .
feels good to talk about that stuff .
i' il be able to sleep now .
you wanna talk about hap ?
morning .
your phone isn' t working .
i turned it off .
i needed to sleep .
sorry .
fred called that author .
he was happy to cooperate .
he' il be in first thing , so we need to get to the office .
i forgot to tell you they sell these in stores in anchorage .
no way of finding out who bought it .
okay .
bet you' re looking forward to getting back to l. a.
back to robbery homicide , or ... ... maybe not .
what are you saying to me , ellie ?
nothing .
are you doing okay ?
you haven' t been sleeping much .
no , i haven' t .
no .
a good cop can' t sleep because a piece of the puzzle' s missing .
a bad cop , because his conscience won' t let him .
you said that once .
i did ?
sounds like something i' d say , don' t it ?
i' il see you back there .
in what regard were you and her familiar ?
how did you know her ?
she was an avid reader of my novels .
when did you meet her first ?
a year ago .
she came to a signing in nightmute .
she hung around afterwards .
we chatted about my writing ... ... and how she wanted to write ... ... then she asked if she could visit me and talk about books , things like that .
and she did ?
yeah , we became very close .
she got comfortable enough to show me her writing .
what does she write ?
poetry , actually .
any good ?
no , not really .
you tell her that ?
why would i ?
exactly what was the nature of your relationship to this girl , finch ?
i was someone she could talk to .
someone outside of her everyday life .
that' s why she needed me and approached me .
why' d she need you for that ?
well , her boyfriend , randy  randy stetz ?
abusive little prick .
he hit her .
we know all this already .
it was getting worse .
so ?
a lot worse .
really .
why all this eagerness to talk about randy ?
you' re right .
i' m sorry .
that' s probably all hearsay .
i don' t want anything i say taken the wrong way .
anything you say to us at this stage is in confidence .
secondly , we' re not a bunch of hotheads who' il draw crazy conclusions .
okay .
please , continue .
one more thing .
probably doesn' t mean much , but i think kay was scared .
i have myself to blame for that .
why is that ?
randy knew who i was .
he knew that she had a friend ... ... someone she confided in .
it made him furious .
she wrote about being scared .
her letters were getting desperate .
you still have these letters , by any chance ?
i probably do .
do you think it might help ?
they might .
okay .
anything else ?
the thing that worried her the most was the gun .
he had this old handgun .
he showed it to her .
i don' t know where he got it , probably wasn' t even his ... ... but he said he' d use it if he found out who she was seeing .
he kept it hidden in a heating vent .
you know , in the skirting boards ?
it might be the . 38 .
get me judge biggs .
what ?
i' m getting a search warrant to randy' s .
get judge biggs on the phone .
i should get over there .
no !
no ?
you' re the guy he' s talking to .
so we' re waiting for the warrant .
okay ?
do you know when randy showed her the gun ?
february ?
no , probably january .
why didn' t you come forward when she died ?
she didn' t want anybody to know .
even when she was dead ?
beaten to death .
her body dumped on a pile of garbage !
i was her friend .
no !
acquaintance .
we were close  close ?
she was attractive .
did you have sex with her ?
she was 17 .
seventeen ?
she was attractive .
i suppose .
suppose ?
she was .
so did you have sex with her ?
no , i was her mentor .
you bought her things .
gifts .
yes .
what kind of gifts ?
books , mostly , that' s what she loved .
books ?
what about this ?
you give her this ?
yes .
why ?
to see how she looked with it on ?
no .
no ?
why jewelry ?
it was just a present .
bought a lot of presents ?
dresses ?
what' s wrong with that ?
nothing .
i' m figuring out what kind of mentor you were .
i gave her things she couldn' t have .
you wanted to fuck her , didn' t you ?
sick son of a bitch !
cool off .
sick bastard .
you have to cool down .
okay ?
cool down .
all right .
i need a break .
i have to apologize on behalf of my colleague .
he' s been under a lot of pressure lately .
but he' s a good cop .
i' d hate to see the bad cop .
search and seizure warrant .
yes , sir .
randy stetz .
we got our warrant !
thank you .
we appreciate it .
francis , come with me .
let' s go !
you' re not going ?
no .
are you not on the connell case ?
i' m covering the shooting of detective dormer' s partner .
heard about that .
should i call about kay' s letters ?
yeah .
i' il pick them up .
stetz !
we' re coming in !
turn the place over .
look there !
try over there !
rich , look here now .
i got it !
hey , fred !
just in time , dormer .
had it in the motor oil .
what the fuck is this ?
he says he was with tanya when kay was killed .
that' s what she told me .
when ?
when i questioned her .
were you planning on telling us ?
that' s what i' m doing now .
randy and tanya were screwing around .
she' s trying to protect him .
and the gun ?
says it isn' t his .
if we get the ballistics match , he' il be forthcoming .
leaving ?
first thing tomorrow .
if spencer can remember where he parked the plane .
i thought you wanted to kill me in the interview room .
randy is in jail .
said i' d write an ending they' d like .
you were wrapped up in details .
the details ?
he' s innocent .
no , he isn' t .
he beat kay .
one day he' d do something worse .
you knew i planted the gun ?
you wanted to help me before the tape recorder .
you had to have a wild card .
you' re a good man .
i know that , even if you' ve forgotten it .
when were you gonna point them at me ?
when you found kay' s dress ?
where i took the body ?
if you have a gun and forensics ... ... wouldn' t matter what i said about you killing your partner .
may i have the tape ?
did you make any other copies ?
why would i ?
stop me from turning you in .
or killing you .
i don' t have a hold over you .
you made choices .
like i wasn' t here .
why kill me ?
it won' t help randy .
after your scene at the department , it won' t do you good if i' m dead .
a lot of ways a man can die .
like an accident ?
like hap .
like kay .
it took you 10 minutes to beat kay connell to death .
ten fucking minutes .
you calling that an accident ?
it took you a fraction of a second to kill your partner .
is that more of an accident ?
is this an accident ?
if you want it to be .
it' s over , walt .
it' s over .
i' m telling them everything .
tell them about hap , you , everything .
what good would that do ?
it' il end this thing .
it won' t end it .
you' re not thinking straight .
will you tell the truth ?
you shot your partner and lied about it .
to them , you' re a liar and a killer .
you' re tainted .
forever !
you don' t get to pick when you tell the truth .
the truth is beyond that .
that tape was the only proof we had a conversation outside of that room .
to them , i' m a writer that kay admired .
randy is the killer , and you' re a hero cop .
your life' s work is intact .
another abusive scumbag is in jail .
everything is as it should be .
go back to los angeles .
the case against randy is pretty solid .
i can take care of everything here .
i got it worked out .
go home .
midnight of your sixth night .
you broke my record , will .
randy stetz .
he was an asshole .
you knew him as a kid ?
dads were on the same boat .
bad seed .
how do you like our beer ?
what dormer needs is a little shuteye .
white nights getting to you ?
hasn' t been easy .
better than winter .
got that right .
sun barely comes up for five months .
like being sucked into a black hole .
hey , nancy drew .
you hear ?
we got him .
rich found the gun .
something' s on her mind .
i found this on the beach .
what is it ?
shell casing , 9mm .
the murder weapon was a . 38 .
none of us carries a 9mm .
or backup weapon , right ?
get a hobby , would you ?
it' s a legitimate point , isn' t it , detective ?
this case is closed , ellie .
hold the fort , boys .
i' il go find a men' s room .
relieve myself of your fine alaskan beer .
do you want a beer or something ?
no , thanks .
he' s good people , right ?
don' t get carried away .
what has two thumbs and loves blowjobs ?
i don' t know .
this guy .
it' s been something , dormer .
it' s been really great working with you .
run will to the airport ?
i gotta pick up the letters .
in umkumiut
at his lake house .
dormer will have to leave my car at the dock .
lf that' s okay with you ?
yeah , it' s fine .
it' s been a pleasure .
get some sleep .
detective dormer .
what is it ?
someone' s complaining about the noise .
says he can' t sleep .
something wrong ?
it' s so fucking bright in here .
no , it' s dark in here .
will you please ... ?
there' s this guy , wayne dobbs , 24 .
works part time at a copy store .
every day he watches this 8 year old boy ... ... waiting for his carpool across the street .
this is one of your cases ?
yeah .
hap and me .
a year and a half ago .
for six months , he watches this kid .
he goes down , grabs that boy before the carpool comes ... ... takes him back to his apartment ... ... and keeps him there for three days .
he tortures him ...
... and makes him do things .
and , finally , he' s had enough .
he gets a rope .
he hangs the boy in a storage space in the basement of the building .
but he didn' t do it right .
little boy' s neck didn' t break , so he dangled there for a while ... ... and then died finally from the shock .
landlord found the body five days later .
the second i met this guy , dobbs , i knew he was guilty .
that' s what i do .
that' s my job .
i assign guilt .
you find the evidence ... ... figure out who did it , and then you go get them and put them away .
this time there wasn' t enough evidence .
and it' s reasonable doubt to a jury ... ... because a jury never met a child murderer before .
but i have .
anyway ....
i went and took some blood samples from the boy' s dead body ... ... and i planted them ...
... in dobbs ' apartment .
i could feel it there .
this is gonna catch up with me .
i don' t do things like that .
so how did it catch up with you ?
internal affairs is coming down on our department .
hap , he was gonna cut a deal ... ... and bring me straight into it .
they would' ve reopened dobbs ' case , he would' ve walked .
now that won' t happen .
and i don' t know ... ... how i feel about that .
but dobbs was guilty .
dobbs needed to be convicted .
so the end justifies the means .
right ?
i' m in no position to judge .
why not ?
two kinds of people live in alaska .
the ones who are born here , and the ones who come here to escape something .
i wasn' t born here .
why don' t you tell me what you think ?
here .
now .
in this room .
you and me .
please .
i guess it' s about what you thought was right at the time .
then , what you' re willing to live with .
" nightmute police department .
detective burr .
she' s not here .
she left town " about 20 minutes ago to go pick up "
mr. finch .
detective burr .
are they friendly ?
yeah .
didn' t expect to see you this soon .
sorry about the mess , doing some work .
could kay' s letters strengthen the case against randy ?
possibly .
watch your head .
i' ve done it 1000 times .
sorry about all the clutter .
i am a pack rat .
i keep everything .
i got them .
just don' t know where .
they' ve gotta be here somewhere .
working on a new book ?
have you read any of my books ?
i haven' t .
she knows , will .
where is she ?
she knows you killed hap .
you would' ve realized if you weren' t strung out .
the way she looks at you  where is she ?
it' s under control .
lf anything happened to her
she' s okay .
if she talks , you' re fucked .
everything you' ve worked for is destroyed .
now give me  show me where she is .
now .
she' s okay .
listen .
i mean , it' s all fine .
let' s search this place .
for the dress .
what dress ?
ellie' s ....
kay' s !
you' re rambling .
ellie' s here .
i' m taking care of us .
us ?
she saw the dress .
us ?
where' d you get us ?
don' t talk about us .
she' s alive , will .
ellie !
hold it !
don' t move !
you shot detective eckhart .
and finch saw you do it .
did you mean to shoot hap ?
i don' t know anymore .
i don' t know .
i couldn' t see him through the fog , but when i got up close ... ... he was afraid of me ... ... and he thought i meant to do it , so maybe i did .
i just don' t know anymore .
where' s your gun ?
he took it .
keep your head down .
i got seven rounds in this clip .
make it last .
head down .
okay , go !
go !
you forgot the wild card .
detective dormer !
i called for backup .
they' il be here soon .
dormer , just hold on .
hold on .
nobody needs to know .
you didn' t mean to do it .
i know that even if you don' t .
no , don' t .
don' t .
what ?
why ?
don' t lose your way .
hang on .
dormer .

no .
just let me sleep .
