my heart
hello ?
yes ?
captain !
yes , we picked him up at the airport .
yes .
this picture .
you took it , didn' t you ?
it was found at the scene .
and you left the country and you left the country on the same day .
this belongs to my son who goes to primary school .
he wrote it on the ground and asked me to shoot it for his girlfriend in class .
and my trip was scheduled last semester .
you took pictures of ji kyung hee .
who ?
the female owner of the studio !
you took her pictures .
no don' t play hard ball .
you took her pictures !
she asked me to .
cut the crap !
she brought us pictures you took and told us everything .
she asked me to !
she was so serious i agreed .
it wasn' t porn .
i took nude pictures of her .
is that a crime ?
nude ?
you took nude pictures of her ?
so you' re telling me ji kyung hee asked you to take pictures of her in the nude ?
look , detective .
i have a family .
honestly , it' s embarrassing ... to even be here .
kyung hee , right ?
i think she had a crush on me .
i' m sorry .
i was testing my camera .
why didn' t you tell me ?
i could' ve been your model .
anything wrong ?
you memorized my name and phone number !
of course you come every week !
why' d you take pictures of your feet ?
of all the pictures , she showed so much interest in my nude ones .
why' d you keep going back ?
you' re a man .
put yourself in my shoes .
she' s pretty and mysterious .
it' s not a bad thing for a girl to be aggressive .
so i kind of enjoyed it .
you play at a concert hall , and i sing at a basement cafe .
we' ve turned out so differently .
tomato juice ?
for her .
coffee is mine .
thanks .
why not drinking it ?
it' s pretty good .
try it .
you' re seeing ki hoon lately ?
change the subject .
i' ve had enough .
with what ?
ka hee , please ...
please what ?
tell me .
you like the way you live ?
didn' t you tell me ?
taking pictures frees your soul ... ... like a little boy .
please .
she said her husband was out of town and asked me to take pictures of her in the nude .
i thought it was too much so i refused at first .
then again , i sometimes hire a professional model , and she was volunteering .
so you did ?
mind giving me one ?
don' t you like the thrill ?
i do .
getting there ... is more fun than being there .
don' t you have that experience ?
fucking is good , but the feeling after you come ...
i didn' t sleep with her .
talk to me .
yes sir .
it' s true he was at the library .
his library card confirms it .
what if he lent it to someone ?
keep digging for witnesses .
and check out his wife too .
yes sir okay .
what now ?
you know what ?
it' s quite boring sitting alone at the studio .
he started keeping me company ... and i was glad .
even thankful .
that was the beginning .
hands at first .
then the shoulders .
what do you think it meant ?
maybe ... he wanted to sleep with me .
tell him about our rule .
one more for the loser !
cheers !
cheers !
come on !
you lost !
one more shot !
sorry about that .
