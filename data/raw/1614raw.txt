eight thousand years ago , atlantis sank beneath the ocean .
the great crystal , the source of its power , was hidden beneath the city .
robbed of the heart of atlantis , my people seemed doomed to slow extinction .
but now we are reborn .
obby , hurry .
we must get back to the throne room .
hold on .
once again the heart of atlantis shines upon us ... healing us , making us strong .
we are using the power of the crystal to rebuild our city ... and to restore our culture to greatness .
under the light of the great crystal , my people are thriving again .
we have uncovered secrets lost for thousands of years .
the city is once again a centre of knowledge and learning ... instead of a place of ignorance and fear .
good day , queen kida .
good day and be careful .
my father thought it better to hide the crystal ... rather than risk the misuse of its power .
as queen , i can only hope i am doing the right thing .
how fitting .
the old king need never shed tears again .
obby .
obby .
all all right .
come on .
show a little respect here .
i never thought the rebuilding of atlantis would move so quickly .
i think we only understand a fraction of what the crystal can teach us .
well , i know that none of it would be possible without you .
okay , one rock .
you know , you' re getting to look like one chubby lava dog .
what is it , obby ?
what is wrong ?
queen kida .
there are intruders approaching the city .
oh , my god .
this way , quick .
they' re coming through the lava tubes .
where is the patrol captain ?
i want them met with fliers .
wait .
they' re not intruders .
they' re friends .
oh , it is beautiful .
yeah .
it' s amazing what a little paint and spackle will do .
audrey , what are you guys doing here ?
just making sure you aren' t making a mess of things down here .
come here .
hey .
ah , two for flinching .
why , thank you .
i hope my hay fever doesn' t kick up .
hello .
so , who wants to show me around the city ?
oh , let me .
i will do it .
no , i saw her first .
no , no .
me , me .
me , me .
boys , boys , you' re both pretty .
we' il all go .
mesdemoiselles .
jeez , i missed you guys .
but why are you here ?
is mr whitmore okay ?
why don' t you ask him yourself ?
milo .
mr whitmore !
not only am i okay , but this crystal of yours makes me feel 20 years younger .
of course , that still leaves me pretty old .
and this must be princess kida , although i guess it would be queen kida now .
and you must be mr whitmore .
thank you .
you brought milo to me and made all this possible .
come .
let us go inside where you can have something to eat .
i guess your decision to stay here wasn' t as hard as i thought .
save my life !
you must try some of this .
delicious .
n now , it' s great to see you all again .
magnifique .
trust me , this is great .
hm , not bad .
pepper sauce .
never leave home without it .
puts a little giddy up in every meal .
also makes a fine paint remover .
uh , sweet , i think this food just moved .
then you better eat it quick before it gets away .
besides , when it' s alive , you don' t have to swallow so hard .
just point them head first so they know which way to crawl .
your grandfather would be proud of you , milo .
you not only discovered a lost empire ... you probably saved the world from rourke' s plans for the crystal .
and now you' re helping restore atlantis to its former glory .
that' s quite a rsum for a cartographer .
i just wish he could be here to see all this ... and to meet kida .
uh , yeah , well , it' s great to see everybody together again ... but something tells me it' s not just for a little reunion .
uh , i' m afraid you' re right .
there' s trouble on the surface .
i already had my doctor , digger , demolition expert , mechanic .
each the top of their field .
but i came here for the one expert i didn' t have ... an expert on atlantis .
but why would you need a ...
several cargo ships have gone down in the north atlantic .
the survivors say it was a sea monster .
we thought it might be the watchdog at your front door .
the leviathan ?
right .
that' s one big sea monster .
in the water , that' s the last thing you wanna see .
except maybe my aunt rose in a swimsuit .
sweet woman , but very large boned .
i' m glad it knew we were friends this time .
but there could be others out there .
my father had many such machines created .
he used the magic and science of the crystal to expand the borders of atlantis .
that war nearly destroyed the world .
well , it looks like his war may not be over .
then milo and i will go with you to the surface and end it .
kida , you can' t .
l i mean , you' re the queen .
the city repairs are well under way .
the counsellors can handle the everyday matters .
and i ...
i feel responsible for what my father did .
i want to understand his decision ... and i am afraid the answers are not in atlantis .
i feel bad .
you finally get to the surface ... and it' s so cloudy , there' s nothing to see .
everything in your world is new to me .
the sky , the clouds , everything on the ship .
what is this ?
that' s a life preserver .
so you wear it and it preserves your life , like our crystals ?
no , no .
you throw it to someone in the water .
oh , so it is a game ?
no .
you only throw it if someone is drowning .
does that not make it hard for them to play the game ?
two weeks we crisscross the north sea and get nothing .
no squids , no jellyfish and no lobster from atlantis .
we have to be sure , vinny .
what if raising the crystal brought this leviathan to life ?
this could all be the fault of atlantis .
i' d worry more about how we fight it than who' s to blame .
last time we shot at the leviathan , these things didn' t even tickle it .
eh , audrey , if you keep hitting that thing ... we' re gonna be " tickled " all over these walls .
yeah , yeah .
like i don' t know that .
well , careful .
doc sweet' s not here to glue us back together .
this time it' s my special blend .
i start with a batter of gelatinous nitroglycerine ... dribble it on a shaped charge of tnt ... and top it with just a dusting of black powder ... and oregano .
you can' t make a bomb without oregano .
it makes a very nice " boom .
let the lobster chew on that .
y you know , i really don' t think it is a leviathan .
the survivor called it the kraken ... a legendary norwegian sea monster with arms a quarter mile long .
nothing like what we saw in atlantis .
but atlantean inventors always base their designs on real animals , like the giant squid .
it may not be a leviathan , but it could still be an atlantean war machine .
she' s right .
no creature of flesh and blood ... can bring down a steel cargo ship .
something' s got the ship !
it' s ripping open the launch doors .
my cheese !
you can have it .
get to the sub pods .
vinny , we' re gonna need that thing out of the way .
coming up , extra oregano .
launch when ready .
next time , chilli powder .
uh oh .
that doesn' t sound good .
it' s pulling them down on the starboard side .
where' s milo and kida ?
i didn' t see them launch .
milo , are you there ?
kida ?
come on , come on .
back up batteries .
time to back up . ... thing off my back while i look for milo .
this is milo .
we' re on back up batteries , sinking fast , no propulsion .
we have a major leak ...
leaks .
leaks .
and the view port is cracking .
if the ballast valves aren' t blocked , you can flush the water by rerouting the pressure tubes and ...
audrey , we are up to our rear ends in water .
it' s no time for how to books .
okay , okay .
we' re coming .
jeez .
well , you' d better hurry ' cause ... we' re about to hit an undersea mountain .
that is not a mountain .
audrey !
got you covered , milo .
watch your right dive plane .
no problem .
uh , where' s the kraken ?
it has disappeared .
at least it was not atlantean .
somehow , that doesn' t make me feel any safer .
the creature buckled hull plates fore and aft .
we' il be lucky to get to the port for repairs .
i' il send a launch for you .
don' t worry about us , captain .
just take care of the atlantean .
there' s a fishing village to the northeast .
we' il be there when you finish repairs .
whoa .
that' s your sub pod .
that' s not coming out of my pay cheque .
okay , let' s get to shore as soon as we can .
what' s the matter , vinny , afraid to play patty cake with the sea monster , ooh ?
no .
i don' t mind a little patty cake ... but i really don' t wanna be here when the bombs on that sub pod hit bottom .
i guess fishing hasn' t been too good lately , huh ?
that is not surprising .
no doubt that tentacled demon ... devoured the local fish stocks long ago .
then why is it still here ?
because it doesn' t eat fish any more .
maybe that' s why they built the village on the cliffs .
you don' t want that thing showing up for dinner .
not real friendly , are they ?
ew , what is that smell ?
it' s like rotting fish .
why do you accuse such a thing ?
i have bathed .
recently .
hmph .
no appreciation for fine cologne .
easy , mole .
she' s upwind of you .
i' d say it' s more likely we' re smelling all this mildew .
everything is wet from the fog .
but you do need a bath .
look at that .
interesting way of attracting tourists .
milo , we got company .
i am edgar volgud , the magistrate of this town .
what is your business here ?
nice to meet you .
my name is milo thatch .
i doubt there is anything in krakenstadt that concerns you .
and what about your town pet that nearly sank our ship ?
your ship will be repaired at the shipyards of tronheim .
you should leave soon .
the roads are treacherous after dark .
i' m sure they can start repairs without us .
we thought we' d stick around a while and enjoy the scenery .
tronheim has excellent views .
all the same , we' il stay .
miss allyson is the innkeeper here .
she' il give you rooms for the night .
a driver will take you to tronheim tomorrow .
i' ve seen that fellow before someplace ...
i think under a rock .
reminds me of a leech , a worm .
a kind of , uh , salamanderish ...
obby , no !
he was born in molten rock .
wasn' t volgud that statue guy ?
that would make him even older than he looks ... which i gotta say is pretty darn old .
they say he made a deal with the devil to live forever ... but forgot to ask for eternal youth .
this will drive the fog from your bones .
thank you .
merci , mademoiselle .
thank you , miss allyson ?
inger .
there is a darkness around edgar volgud ... and that shadow has dimmed all that was happy here .
we would leave , but this inn is all we have .
it is no place for me to raise my little one .
things will not change here until its power is broken .
its ?
you mean volgud' s ?
or the sea monster' s ?
i will prepare rooms for you .
but do not cross edgar volgud ... and leave as soon as you can .
they gotta work on their tourist industry .
come on .
just follow his lantern .
where is that coming from ?
what is it ?
it is not of this earth .
no .
that' s a bird .
a very big gooney bird .
or a , uh , puffin ... with a very upset stomach .
uh , no , it' s voices .
i can' t make out what they' re ...
where' s volgud ?
his light is gone .
we could be walking in circles .
we' d better head back to the village .
and which way would that be ?
oh , over there .
head for the lights before the fog closes in again .
just a moment .
listen to the gravel .
not now , mole .
but this is decomposed granite ... which would mean we are headed for the cliff ...
audrey !
i' m okay .
for now .
be careful , milo .
i' m climbing down to you , audrey .
stay where you are .
here i was , all set to take a walk .
audrey , keep talking to me .
i said thank you very much for leading us off a cliff .
hey , i was heading toward the village ...
lights .
uh , i guess there' s more going on here than sea monsters .
oh , great .
somebody' s doin ' hocus pocus .
i hate hocus pocus .
i ...
i can' t reach .
i' il have to jump .
uh , don' t jump .
i' il climb down .
there' s no room .
i have to jump .
audrey , i' m the team leader , and i order you not to jump .
oh , that' s it !
see ?
audrey !
you see , you cannot live without me .
gather the possessions of the strangers ... and burn them .
what' s the matter , volgud ?
you think we' ve got fleas ?
gee .
you seem surprised to see us .
definitely worm or leech .
salamanders are too cute .
we' d like to hear more about volgud' s deal with the devil .
it is an old wives ' story , a folk tale , nothing more .
inger , we want to help .
lives have been taken at sea , and i suspect in this town .
i would love to let my little one play outside again .
long ago , the fish left the sea .
the town was in danger of dying .
a bargain was struck .
the souls of the people for the life of the town .
the kraken ?
sometimes known as the " devil fish .
the town is provided for , but no one can leave .
and the sun has not shone since .
folklore or not , there is a connection between the kraken and this town .
volgud hands out food and supplies from somewhere .
maybe a hidden cave ?
i could search .
would make a very nice boom .
ha .
the answer is staring at you right in the face .
regard .
how an igneous boulder ... has been futilely disguised as sedimentary rock .
they might as well paint a road sign .
they look exactly the same to me .
yeah , but you weren' t raised by naked mole rats .
that would explain so much .
this is all from the sunken freighter .
there' s volgud .
volgud is controlling the kraken .
how ?
table scraps and a rolled up newspaper ?
he' s not using table scraps .
it' s some sort of mental power .
look at the workers .
they look hypnotized .
i think he uses that power to enslave the creature ... telling it what ships to attack .
if we can rattle volgud' s concentration , he' il lose control over the kraken .
tickling will be good .
nobody can concentrate when they' re being tickled .
or , uh , a bomb .
a bomb is a very good distraction .
shh !
wait .
where' s audrey ?
sacrebleu !
get audrey .
i' il distract him .
what ?
but he' s unconscious .
it should go away .
audrey !
okay , now we try plan b ...
plan bomb .
no .
not at the creature .
at the ceiling .
how about picking the target before i light the dynamite , huh ?
get to the sub pods .
we have to stop the kraken from getting out .
out of our way , barbarians !
talk to me , mole .
we got to find that cave exit .
our best chance to trap the kraken is to seal him inside .
audrey , you doing all right ?
yeah .
now .
eww !
it was creepy .
all cold and slimy .
everything faded away like i was drowning .
hey , pay attention !
it is too dark to see .
fire the magnesium flares .
what are you doing ?
we want to sneak up on ...
jiminy christmas !
it' s already out !
oh , stay clear of the tentacles .
no kidding .
i' m gonna take a shot .
it' s no good .
i can' t line up a decent shot .
we' re on him .
open wide .
it' s chow time .
what are you waiting for ?
fire the ...
jeez !
tell him to watch his aim .
he almost hit aud ...
look out !
shoot at the squid , not us !
vincent has gone mad !
his mind is a blank .
but volgud ...
it' s not volgud .
it' s the kraken .
of course .
the kraken is the one with the mind powers .
it is okay .
i have distracted him .
watch out !
monster on the move !
oh .
that was really strange .
i' m down to my last shot .
as am i.
head back to the beach .
we' ve got to get on dry land .
no .
are you crazy ?
you' re heading right at it !
i will distract him again .
aah !
i am blinded !
it' s milo' s sub pod .
it' s got a full load of torpedoes .
we can blow them all at once .
let' s do it !
you know , i think mr squid was a little bit hocus pocus himself .
oh , yeah , you won' t find the kraken in any biology book .
the curse is lifted , the fish are back ... and the mildew has been scrubbed away .
so if something stinks now , uh ...
what ?
why you do this with your hand ?
it is the fish .
for 8, 000 years , i have lived with the same faces .
it is strange to meet new people .
and each new person has new thoughts , new ideas .
your world has much to offer .
i hope one day my people , the people of atlantis , can offer as much .
well , there' s no reason they can' t .
your people can make a difference to the world , like we did here .
now that there' s no kraken , it' s left to people like inger allyson ... to raise their little ones in peace .
we can never thank them enough .
now you can grow big and strong ... and someday be the most important person in town .
now give mama a big hug .
please tell me that' s not the same stuff you fed us on the way to atlantis .
bet your sweet eyes it is .
now i told you ... it would keep and keep and keep .
and now it' s yours to eat and eat and eat .
that' s right , margie .
they showed me all around the city .
yeah .
it broke their hearts , but i need my space .
kemot was too clingy .
careful , mole .
obidalbedsugs aren' t used to such a variety in their diet .
it' s only a few assorted silicates i' ve been meaning to get rid of .
oh .
it' s good for the gums .
hey , where' s kida ?
it' s even more beautiful when the snow melts .
this time there was no leviathan .
but how do we know there are not other atlantean weapons out there ?
uh , not looking at the scenery , huh ?
maybe the crystal' s too powerful .
maybe it should remain buried .
but your people , they' ve regained so much .
could you put them in darkness again ?
what are the chances of another gas leak in a chinese laundry ?
so that' s my last flower shop .
but i' m thinking about buying a laundry .
so , i guess now that we know there' s no leviathan on the loose ...
excuse me . you two will be heading back home to atlantis .
excuse me .
it' s a laundry slash fireworks ...
but don' t be in such a rush .
take some time to see the world .
plane fare is on me .
that' s very generous , mr whitmore .
may i have your attention , please ?
hmm , that' s better .
it' s dr sweet .
there' s trouble in the southwest .
sam' s a long time field agent of mr whitmore' s .
he' s best at digging up hard to find objects .
only this time , i think something found him .
and you say he mentioned killer coyotes in a sandstorm ?
mm , no , not exactly .
more like a sandstorm made up of killer coyotes who were made up of sand .
and this is unusual in your world ?
oh , yes .
more than a little bit .
but i do not understand why you wanted me here .
because of this .
milo , it is atlantean .
uh , where did you find this ?
you' il have to ask sam .
i can' t tell if he' s breathing .
eh , perhaps he is dead .
oh , he' s just sleeping .
after what he' s been through , i' m sure he can use the rest .
hey .
aah !
get away , you furry carcass rats !
it' s all right , mr mckeane .
you' re safe now .
mr whitmore sent us .
oh , good old preston .
best man i ever scavenged for .
er , say , young fella , could you fluff up my pillow ?
now , uh , how about a sip of water ?
my gullet' s awful dry .
ohh !
ow !
ow !
ow !
what' s wrong ?
got a little sleepy in the foot .
uh , would you mind givin ' it a rub ?
ewww !
and you say coyotes did this to you ?
no .
' twernt no ordinary coyotes .
these was cantankerous sand coyotes .
' twernt a lick of wind all day ... but i sure heard it howlin ' up on the mesas that night .
i thought i was loco when i saw them dust devils materializing in moonlight .
their red eyes like to burn a hole right through my soul .
came screamin ' off that ridge like a pack of ghosts .
i ran back to my shack and bolted the door .
i figured i' d be safe if i stayed inside .
i was wrong .
scratched me up like a two sizes too small wool sweater on a hot afternoon .
luckily , i had plenty of bacon grease to rub all over my hide ...
to ease the chaffin ' .
dinnertime .
mr mckeane , what have we told you about the bacon grease ?
works better than any of your darn fool fix ' em ups .
i stood a better chance with them coyotes .
is he going to be all right ?
oh , yes .
we' re moving him to the hospital in scottsdale where he' il be their problem .
so where did you find this ?
in a pot .
what pot ?
in the crate .
what crate ?
in my shack .
what shack ?
hmm .
i' m not surprised this is where he lives .
you saw the man eat , right ?
lives like he eats ... sloppy .
maid' s day off , huh ?
quartz , uh , silicate , mixed with local clay .
mm , uh , slightly nutty to the taste .
nothing unusual .
sand isn' t the only thing here that' s nutty .
everything seems to have been rubbed smooth .
even the windows are etched .
from the sand ?
mckeane said they were sand coyotes .
i see lots of sand , no coyotes .
no paw prints either .
looks like the crate' s ...
missin ' ?
dang blame it !
i know just what varmint done took it too .
it' d be that shifty eyed , back stabbin ' rattlesnake ashton carnaby .
he runs a tradin ' post outside of town .
you best be careful .
he' s slicker than a sweaty toad in a rainstorm .
let' s look around a little first .
we don' t know for certain that this carnaby guy took sam' s crate .
no , obby !
stay !
stay !
he' s , uh , a brazilian iguana .
eats just about anything .
trust me .
there are pieces here that are hundreds of years old .
oh , look , an antique .
how are people to use these things if they' re locked behind glass ?
it' s for protection .
i know what the spear is for .
but why is it in a glass case ?
no , the glass case is for protection .
wouldn' t the spear be better protection than a glass case ?
yes ...
no !
it' s there to protect from someone who might want to steal it .
why would someone want to steal a glass case ?
calcified limestone more than 25 million years old ... from the cenozoic era .
hydrated aluminium silicates with basalt ... found primarily in the southern colorado river basin .
plastic !
bleeck !
milo , it' s just like an atlantean guardian .
well , not exactly .
it' s been modified by noshoni design .
either way , i am buying it .
ho ho .
that' s what i like to hear .
because i want to sell it .
the name' s carnaby .
now , that painting' s of crystal guardian ... who crawled from the earth with weapons of blue fire .
he was a great teacher and healer of the sick .
or so the legend goes .
how much is it ?
well , that' s a museum class piece .
i' il bet there' s a museum class price to go with it too .
it is rare , and i' ve had offers .
is this enough ?
kida , that that' s a lot ...
sold !
one crystal guardian .
so , mr carnaby , where exactly do you get all of your artefacts ?
well , uh , here and there .
but the older pieces are 100 % authentic , i assure you .
oh , i don' t doubt that .
well , we' re looking for a crate ... that may have been taken from sam mckeane .
who are you people ?
we' re associates of sam mckeane , and he' s asked us to help locate the missing crate .
uh , can' t help you .
mckeane has a tendency to tell stories .
i think he gets lonely out there in the desert .
so you don' t know anything about it ?
if mckeane lost a crate of pottery , that' s not my problem .
what in the red rock river valley are you doin ' ?
sampling the bowl .
it is very nice .
would you like some ?
well , that could have gone better .
does it strike anybody as odd that carnaby knows the missing crate contains pottery ?
because i never mentioned what was in it .
you are right .
i don' t trust that carnaby .
don' t like him one bit .
didn' t like his attitude .
didn' t like his shifty little eyes .
eyes are the windows to the soul , you know ?
how would you like to gaze into the windows of my soul ?
hey , didn' t we just pass that guy ?
perhaps they are brothers ?
twice is a coincidence .
but three times ?
i think someone' s trying to tell us something .
uh , hello .
can we offer you a ride ?
it' s a long walk to anywhere .
my name is chakashi .
and , yes , a ride would be welcome .
oh , he' s , uh , brazilian .
i' m familiar with all nature' s creatures .
this one is also known to me .
you wouldn' t happen to have a twin or two , would you ?
there are many noshoni men who walk alone in the desert .
and we look all the same to the eyes of outsiders .
ah , crystal guardian , our great teacher and protector .
he revealed many secrets to the noshoni .
the path of the stars , the time to plant , how to heal themselves .
and like crystal guardian ... we will also protect our sacred beliefs from outsiders .
those who would plunder our lands to betray our secrets ... will answer to the ancient forces of the desert .
a sandstorm ?
where did that come from ?
we are followed .
there are ancient powers that will make certain our secrets are kept ... and you , more than anyone , should understand this .
they' re trying to drive us off the road .
i just put in that windshield .
he' s gone !
how ?
where could he go ?
people , we got bigger problems .
they' re in here with us .
no .
dust doggies , go away !
ohh !
this is just great !
the intake' s got a thirty torque tolerance that' s been blown ... and the combustion valves need a new ring slip !
i didn' t quite get all that .
i build these engines from scratch .
i fend off lava dogs who eat the distributor caps .
and nobody told me i would have to deal with dust storm coyotes .
if they got sand in the manifold , i quit !
did you get it all that time ?
every word .
we have returned .
we are back at the trading post .
chakashi said there were ancient forces at work .
uh , make a note to stay on their good side .
better yet , no more picking up hitchhikers .
hey , uh , i told you people to leave .
we have a couple of questions .
i' ve already answered your questions .
pet iguana .
eats anything ... meaning you might be on the menu .
how do you know that the missing crate contains pottery ?
uh , i don' t .
uh , i , uh ...
and what do you know about an old man who calls himself chakashi ?
i know i got a shelf full of painted rocks of him inside .
of course .
chakashi .
the noshoni wind spirit .
we gave a ride to a spirit ?
you can' t really believe in that superstition .
well , we were just attacked by a pack of phantom coyotes in a sandstorm .
the same restless spirits that came after sam mckeane .
and whoever has that crate of pottery .
save it .
i' m not superstitious .
oh , i smell old pottery .
you had the crate all along .
voil !
it' s rubbed smooth . just like the inside of mckeane' s shack .
well , there' s no way you could prove it .
sandstone , heavy red oxides , basalt ... encrusted with the same silicate found in mckeane' s shack .
well , so what ?
mckeane found it in the desert ... and then while he was in the hospital , i found it in his shack .
that is called stealing .
that' s called commerce , honey .
besides , mckeane' s the only one who knows the location of where the pot came from .
judging from the high alkaline content ...
i would say it came from a cave on the south face of the mogollon rim ... fifteen miles north of here .
mm hmm .
he' s good .
dirty , but good .
well , you know , maybe i didn' t take things seriously enough .
there are a lot of old tales and mysteries out here in the desert ... and the coyotes you encountered are a good example .
i thought you didn' t believe .
well , i sure don' t want to end up like mckeane .
so maybe if the pot' s returned , that' il settle these restless spirits .
i , gaetan moliere , have done it .
i have found the subterranean gateway ... that is the very threshold to the unknown !
ah .
it' s just a hole .
a hole ?
blaah !
look at the lines in the basalt .
the beauty of the erosion .
the poetry of the clay .
this is not a hole .
it is a tunnel .
huh .
i don' t care what you call it .
just tell me it' s big enough to hide in .
' cause we got company !
inside !
quick !
i will save us !
milo .
holy cats !
none of this should exist .
not in the same place .
it' s a blending of every culture from idaho to peru .
noshoni , aztec , mayan , olmec .
my people were here .
ohh !
crystal guardian was an atlantean .
his teaching influenced all these cultures .
a little bit of atlantis goes a long way .
carnaby , that old pot can fit on any of those ledges .
carnaby ?
what is that ?
sorry .
it was me .
hold on .
that was not me !
carnaby !
oh , about the pot .
it looks like i' m going to be keeping it along with everything else in here .
that home made prairie grass mixture makes a good sleeping gas ... wouldn' t you agree ?
carnaby , you snake !
naturally , i can' t let you go free to tell the world about my discovery .
i mean , where' s the profit in that ?
what ?
carnaby !
nice nap ?
hope the rocks weren' t too uncomfortable .
oh , no .
this particular aggregate is very nice .
one of my favourites .
you will not get away with this .
mm , let' s see .
i trap you and your friends in this cave ... and then i take all the treasure for myself ... but i think i' il get away with it .
i knew there was something shifty about you .
didn' t i say so ?
i said , " i don' t trust that carnaby .
don' t like him one bit .
don' t like this attitude .
don' t like his shifty little eyes .
and don' t forget .
the eyes are the windows to the soul .
mm hmm .
that' s right .
i said that too .
well , you and your friends will have a long time ... to discuss how you feel about me while i' m gettin ' rich .
we have found evidence of my people here .
we cannot let him destroy it .
mr carnaby , obviously we' ve had some sort of miscommunication here .
i don' t see any reason why we can' t work something out .
save your breath , junior .
you' re gonna need it .
happy trails .
it' s no use .
if there was only some way to cut these ropes .
obby !
obby , come on , boy .
wake up .
wake up !
that' s it .
okay .
enough !
no !
no !
get the ropes !
the ropes !
good boy .
no !
take care of the dynamite first !
oh , uh , yeah , yeah .
right , right .
kida !
you' ve managed to be more trouble than i expected .
i' il just take care of you myself ...
ohh !
oh , now you done it .
gone and made us mad .
uh , what is this ?
retribution .
anyone out here got a doggy bone ?
what happened to carnaby ?
he is with us now .
you seem like good people .
i' m sorry .
the secrets of the ancient ancestors must remain a secret .
you will not be allowed to leave .
chakashi , we also carry a great secret .
thus , we can keep yours as well .
what is this secret ?
prove to me that it is as great as what you see around you .
we can' t .
very well .
you have decided your fate .
if you had told me your secret ...
i would have known i couldn' t trust you with mine .
hmph .
it was a trick question .
must be the coyote in me .
kida of atlantis , you and i are not so different .
your people touched the corners of the globe , teaching and healing .
doing great good .
but they also did great harm ... almost destroying the world and themselves .
my father feared the temptation to abuse our power would be too great .
so he hid it away .
the secret you carry is neither good nor bad .
a strong leader must have the wisdom to know when to share that knowledge .
it would be wonderful if my people did not need to remain hidden ... to have them walk the surface of the world again .
it is your choice .
whoa !
that was impressive .
i would have been more impressed if chakashi had dropped us off on the ground .
it' s strange , all right .
started early this morning .
but i guess you had your share of weird weather in the southwest .
it was okay .
except for how i keep finding sand everywhere .
i could go for some warm weather about now .
maybe get a tan .
sorry i missed it .
oh , no , you are not .
there were dust doggies everywhere .
but i did find this very tasty bowl .
well , mr whitmore , kida and i had better be going because ...
atlantis is waiting .
i know . just as well .
what ?
ah , we had break in last night .
are you okay ?
yes , i' m fine .
but it burns me that someone could waltz right in here ... and steal something right off my wall ... an ancient norwegian spear .
kind of a fancy old letter opener .
what you needed was a glass case to protect it .
he must have come in the middle of the night .
by the tracks i found , he had some kind of dog with him .
the real strange thing is , near as i can tell , there' s no sign of forced entry .
whoever it was knew exactly what they were looking for and helped themselves .
with this spear of destiny ... shall i , odin , king of the northern gods ... end this world .
why would someone take an old spear ... when there' s so much other junk around ?
don' t get me wrong .
it' s , uh , all good junk .
i' m more interested in these scorch marks on the floor .
like lightning struck here .
obby !
it cannot be the lightning .
see for yourself .
there' s no hole in the roof .
no black powder .
not explosives .
fire did not fall from the sky in atlantis like it does here .
i do not like it .
yeah , me neither .
mr whitmore ...
i' m thinking that wasn' t any ordinary spear , was it ?
do i own anything that' s ordinary ?
regardless , i do have a good idea who took it .
the man' s name is erik hellstrom .
son of a gun was a fierce competitor of mine .
built a shipping empire with cruise liners .
when he bought the biggest dang castle in the old country ... and named it asgard ... the press dubbed him " the modern odin .
yeah , he liked being treated as a god , and he lived like one ... until the stock market crash sank his company .
he lost his money , his power and , i think , his mind .
hadn' t heard from him till he phoned last week ... desperately trying to convince me to sell the spear to him .
raving about ragnarok .
what is ragnarok ?
doomsday in the old norse myths .
but why did mr hellstrom want the spear ?
seems to me i remember something about a spear in the shepherd' s journal .
i found it .
gunokneer .
gesundheit .
no , no .
gunokneer was the name of an atlantean spear .
the spear hellstrom stole from whitmore was the same spear ... an atlantean spear .
weapons of atlantis contain untold power .
if the myths are right , that' s an understatement .
at ragnarok , the final night of the world ...
odin will use the spear to summon the forces of chaos and destruction .
he' s going to use the spear to bring about ragnarok .
armageddon .
judgement day .
the end of the world .
the end of atlantis .
of everything .
my father foresaw this .
your father was trying to save his empire , kida .
this guy' s just frosted ' cause he' s in the poor house .
f f frosted .
it it' s iceland , you see ?
so if hellstrom is going to be stopped ... it looks like you' re going to iceland .
why can' t ragnarok be in miami ?
you know , a nice , warm place .
i' m never gonna get a tan .
kida ?
milo ... my father knew the power of atlantis would be abused like this .
as king , it was his responsibility to do as he saw fit .
perhaps it is the same with hellstrom .
yeah , but hellstrom gave himself this crown ... and he isn' t trying to save anybody .
and that' s a big difference .
we ought to be nearing iceland .
and that name ain' t just for show .
with any luck , this weather will lighten up .
we should not be flying in such a storm .
we' il crash .
we are too high above the dirt .
you know , the weather hasn' t let up since hellstrom stole that spear .
i wonder if ...
coincidence , milo .
take over , vinny .
i mean , come on .
the old gods affecting the weather ?
well , there was that indian wind god , spirit , whatever , kraken .
yeah , the kraken might have been a god .
maybe not .
oh , vinny !
and that big atlantis crystal ... that was kind of like a god .
all i' m saying , we see a lot of strange stuff .
i' m , uh , just being open minded .
well , you let go of my plane that way ... and i' il toss your open mind right into that soup .
but we are over land now .
good solid land .
yes .
relax , mole .
we' ve been over iceland for minutes .
the land' s as solid as ...
uh , you' re gonna want to take a look at this .
hellstrom' s castle ?
what did you call it ?
asgard .
home of the gods .
this is the power of the spear .
that' s what i call " home improvement .
look out !
we' il crash !
we' il crash !
relax .
we' re not going to crash into any mountain .
unless it stands up .
you missed us .
that thing could have been a god .
buckle up !
we' re going down !
piece of cake .
oh , my beautiful land .
mm !
my lips !
i am sorry for your flying machine , audrey .
easy come , easy go .
uh , oh , look at the bright side .
uh , w we' re alive .
but we' re not exactly getting a warm welcome .
maybe i' il give him a present .
oh , great .
more hocus pocus .
i bid you welcome ... to the hall of odin .
uh , listen , mr hellstrom , you' ve caught some bad breaks ... but there' s no reason to take it out on the world .
i know you .
it' s the spear .
its power is one of destruction .
it will destroy you , uh , all of us .
ha !
i know you .
you' re the trickster ...
loki .
you seek the power of my spear .
no .
you' il not trick me .
stop , mr hellstrom .
mm , my lord , odin .
i know the power of your spear .
the same power almost destroyed my father .
father ?
of course .
brunhilde , my daughter .
my valkyrie .
you' ve come to rule the new world at my side .
no .
i am not your daughter ... but i do care about you .
kida !
neither man nor god will stop ragnarok .
i cast thee out of asgard ... to your doom .
do not drop me .
you could lay off the eclairs , you know .
i cannot help it .
it' s the creme filling .
mole , we need you up here .
go away .
i am praying .
mole , we got one chance .
we need you to dig .
mole stays .
mole !
oh , fine .
i will come .
it is always mole that must save the day .
hey , watch it .
don' t make me sorry i saved you .
a good thing that you are not any skinnier , milo .
perhaps you should eat more eclairs .
get on with it .
you know , i' m not used to this going up .
as a digger , i dig down , deep into the earth .
see , of course you may have noticed i am rather afraid of heights and ...
dig !
you see ?
you are a warrior born ... my brunhilde , my daughter .
i am not your daughter .
i am kiyadacash , queen of atlantis .
what have you done with my friends ?
i cast them out , brunhilde , into the abyss below .
no !
it could not be helped .
we must go , daughter .
the chaos lord of fire must be awoken before sundown .
today must be ragnarok .
yes .
let us leave .
quickly .
what do you see ?
he' s using the spear to carry them to the volcano .
what else is out there ?
his hundred foot bodyguard .
and i see our only way out ... this big wooden door .
if we can find a way to open it ...
just call me the doorman .
so we can get out , but we still can' t go anywhere .
heh .
we are trapped .
what are we to do , ride this door down the stairs like a ski jump ?
oh , no .
no , no , no .
no !
whoa !
i believe that we should all lean .
whoa !
move over , mole .
i' il pilot this thing .
move over where ?
everybody lean left .
mole , your other left .
roadblock !
pull me up !
no , milo .
we could use you like a rudder .
yeah , he' s gonna have a limp after that one .
hellstrom , you must listen to me .
my father ...
yes ?
no .
my real father .
he hid away this power so it could not be used for destruction .
it was to be used for love , for life , for all that is good .
hellstrom , stop this madness .
i beg you .
use this power to heal the world .
brunhilde , that' s exactly what i intend to do .
i , alone , am destined to remake it and rule over it anew .
to begin again , i must destroy what is .
no .
you cannot .
kida !
you' il not stop me , loki .
lo !
ragnarok !
say your goodbyes to this world ... and herald in my new order .
even at the end , the forces of darkness would thwart the king of the gods .
you' re not the king of anything , hellstrom .
you' re a boat builder .
shoo , birds .
shoo .
no !
there now .
ragnarok approaches .
it is i , odin , who shall stand triumphant .
you really think you' re still in charge ?
those two are done taking orders .
and the fire lord will set the sky ablaze .
and the earth will become as ice as a new age dawns .
so , milo , you got a plan ?
eh , just thought i' d ask .
wait a second .
l i do have a plan .
now a little heat .
it' s working .
oh , now they' re ticked .
the spear !
i will get it !
vinny , we need another bomb .
i' m fresh out .
kida !
i' m all right , milo .
my asgard !
my kingdom !
no !
give him a while .
let him mourn his kingdom .
then we' il get him to a hospital where maybe he can be helped .
and as for that thing , i' m thinking you should put it in a safe .
like now .
maybe with some chains , and locks ... big ones .
i have a better place for this spear .
i learned many things from your world .
most of all , i think i now know my father better .
my father was only protecting us and the world above ... when he hid the heart of atlantis .
i understand that now .
uh , kida , you can' t hide the crystal again .
i mean , it would ...
oh .
sorry .
sort of ruining the moment there .
but ...
but my father was wrong .
he thought mankind would use the power of the crystal for destruction .
but look around you .
the heart of atlantis has let us rebuild our city .
and i saw how the knowledge of atlantis touched a tribe of surface people ... and made them great healers and teachers .
the brightest light is worth nothing if hidden in a cave .
i do not want the legacy of atlantis ... to be the destruction of its civilization .
let us share our light with the world .
huh ?
what is that light , queen kida ?
is it a crystal ?
no , child .
it is the sun .
i think i swallowed my gum .
the world was never the same after that day .
it was much , much better .
