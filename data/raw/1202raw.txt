molly .
molly !
molly !
hey .
good morning .
are we there yet ?
hell , you woke up just in time for the ribbon cutting ceremony .
so this is home .
well , it wasn' t much to begin with .
if you remember , your dad built this as a hunting retreat at first .
then towards the end , he just sort of became a full time resident .
just like us .
listen , i' m no expert , but wouldn' t a couch in a headshrinker' s office be more comfortable ?
well , she' s not the only one who needed change .
my god , people still use those things ?
i like to hear what i' m typing .
i get into a rhythm .
it' s like music .
well , a broom will clean my porch , but i' il take my leaf blower any day .
ah , always kept it here , right over the fireplace .
he kept it clean .
oh , yeah .
he took care of his property .
if he owned it ...
he took real good care .
yeah , except his liver .
yeah , well ... there' s that .
i found the water pump .
do you think it' s ... ?
okay , give it a try .
thanks for your help , byron .
if there' s anything i can do , don' t hesitate .
you shouldn' t have said that .
i might want to collect .
now , take care .
mommy , mommy .
mommy , mommy .
place looks good .
shaping up , huh ?
i was thinking tomorrow i' d start up on the book .
maybe take the underwood out on the boat ... try pounding out a few pages on the water , fishing for some new ideas .
that was a joke , you know .
more of a pun , really .
what was ?
the " fishing " for the ... never mind .
you should come too .
you should ... bring a blanket , spread out on the dock .
it' s warm out , you could catch some sun .
it would be good for you .
there' s still a lot to do around here .
the roof' s not going to fall in .
you can take a little time off .
don' t you think we' ve had enough time off in the last two years ?
but we just got here .
i don' t want to argue .
i' m not trying to argue .
let' s not confuse ourselves .
we' re not here on vacation .
this isn' t a break from our lives .
this is it .
this is our life .
i don' t want to think about what could' ve been or should' ve been .
we' re okay , moll .
we' re broke , robert .
well , i can' t argue with that .
shit !
no , no , no !
shit !
so ... my day sucks so far .
how about you ?
i' m going to need more water .
the turn carriage on the underwood is , shall i say , faulty ?
you think the way those things are built you could drop it off a 10 story building and it' d still type out " war and peace .
she demands i be gentle with her if i' m going to poke at her all day .
i was going to boil some of that brown rice , maybe heat a up a few cans of black beans .
how about duck ?
you know , chantrelle' s has claim to the finest duck fricassee in all of new york' s grandiose french fare .
but ... you ain' t had nothing until you' re picking buckshot out of a red bellied mallard .
would you put that away ?
please .
you don' t ...
relax , molly .
this thing hasn' t been used ...
what' s going on ?
what ?
molly , did you load this ?
if you want rice , we' re going to need more water .
where are they ?
what ?
let go of me .
where are they ?
all right !
it' s not what you think .
no , i' m sure it isn' t .
10 years living together in the city , you don' t even like to carry pepper spray in your purse , molly .
and now ... what ?
i mean , are you curious ?
do you want to know how to ?
robert !
no , hold this .
hold it , molly !
she carries five .
one in the chamber , which you already know ...
four in stock ...
stop it !
you need more than one , right ?
stop it !
pills can be just pumped from your stomach .
but this would really do the trick , wouldn' t it , molly ?
how can i stop a bullet ?
where are you going ?
no !
don' t !
not only do i get to lose a daughter and a father , no , i get to lose the whole damn thing !
wait !
robert !
shit .
come on .
come on , baby !
aw , come on .
there you go .
oh , crap !
is that right ?
i did not know that .
i must say ...
i' ve enjoyed your company , but ...
i gotta get on with my day .
hello ?
anybody out there ?
don' t move .
here we go .
darling , you ain' t gonna feel a thing .
hey !
hey , yourself .
didn' t see you back there .
you here to rob me or something ?
what are you doing to her ?
well , nothing that concerns you .
it' s ... police business .
sir , you' re going to need to drop the rifle .
you hear what i said ?
i asked you ...
those handcuffs .
come again ?
i want you to take those handcuffs off her .
why would i do that ?
i want you to put them on .
me put them on ?
damn it , put them on !
why would i do such a thing like that ?
no .
okay , stop right there .
i am not going to continue this conversation without my sidearm .
i said , stop !
do you know what the term " obstruction of justice " is , mister ? !
i mean it !
don' t you move .
help ...
i mean it !
stay away from that car .
damn it .
stay away ...
robert ?
oh , baby .
don' t ever leave me like that , ever .
molly .
i don' t know what i' d do if i lost you .
molly , you need to listen .
you' ve been the one holding it together , i know that .
i' ve just been selfish , i' ve been so selfish .
hey , no .
hey , molly .
molly .
there' s something i need to show you .
what do we do ?
under normal circumstances i' d call the police , but ...
are you positive he was going to kill her ?
am i positive ?
no , molly .
i' m not .
i' m sure it' s standard police procedure to smash a rock into the back of a suspect' s head .
don' t yell at me .
i' m just trying to understand .
i say we leave .
what ?
we leave her in the cabin and we get the hell out of town .
she needs a doctor .
we can' t just leave her here .
molly , if i' m going to own up to this and explain myself ,
i' m doing it by phone from my lawyer' s office in new york .
robert , look at her .
look at me .
i' ve got blood on me ... from two different people .
okay .
okay .
just pack up our clothes .
just leave everything else .
hurry .
no !
no !
you' re okay .
you' re okay .
you' re okay .
shh .
it' s all over .
it' s okay .
it' s okay .
you' re safe now .
shh .
don' t you do this to me .
oh , god , yes !
molly ?
i' m right here .
what are you doing ?
i' m not leaving her .
molly ... as much as you and i would like to do the right thing something tells me to leave good enough alone and run .
if we can' t trust the law , what choice do we have ?
i saved her life .
beyond that she is not our responsibility .
i know .
okay .
but i' m making her my responsibility .
where are you going ?
it' s not like you can snap your fingers and make everything go away .
we' re going to have company .
i' m gonna have to go and clean up .
ah ... !
oh , god .
ah !
sheriff dodd ...
jesus .
sheriff dodd , please respond .
what' s your 20 ?
oh my god .
robert .
robert .
did you kill him ?
yeah .
good .
first off , my name is robert .
molly told me .
i' m rae .
short for regina .
feeling any better ?
it hurts to breathe sometimes , but i think i' m just bruised mostly .
i don' t even want to know what i look like .
i know you must have a lot of questions about ... what happened out there , specifically what happened while you were unconscious .
where is he ?
where is sheriff dodd ?
he won' t ever be able to hurt you again .
rae , i think it' s important right now to focus on how you got there .
would you be in danger if you were to go back home ?
no , no , i can' t go back .
why ?
do you have any family we need to contact , or friends ?
no , i' ve got no one .
but rae , if we' re going to help try and clear all of this ...
no , no , if i could just stay here .
just for a little while longer .
i want to know what you did to make that man want to kill you .
robert !
what i did ?
what i did ?
like , what ?
like somehow this is my fault ?
that' s not what i meant .
i may not be a perfect person , mister , but i sure don' t know what i did to be beat on like i was .
i' m not saying ...
because i was sure as hell asking him when he was cuffing my hands behind my back ,
and kicking me in the face . ...
rae , he didn' t mean to imply that ... ... pulling my panties off and yanking my legs apart .
that' s a really good question , mister .
i' d like to know that myself .
maybe you should' ve asked the sorry son of a bitch before you killed him .
you may want to get some rest if you' re coming with us tonight .
truck' s a little low on gas , but as soon as we get into town ...
what was that all about ?
it was like you were attacking her .
that' s not what i was doing .
you can' t expect a young girl to snap back like a rubber band after she' s been through something like that .
you have to give her time .
remember when ashley' s teacher ...
let' s not do that .
you might want to wait until that cools .
you don' t want to crack your tank .
i was ugly in there .
l ...
i' m sorry .
i know you didn' t mean what you said ,
i just ...
got a lot of anger in me .
that' s understandable .
really ?
i don' t understand any of it .
maybe in time .
maybe .
i don' t think it' s going to get any cooler than that .
you saved my life .
no one' s ever done that before .
thank you .
it' s a first for me , too .
someone' s coming up the drive .
what do we do ?
hide .
get in the back .
they must have found the car .
they' re coming for me .
who' s coming for you ?
just go .
hide , hide .
anyone in there ?
robert graves ?
i have a summons for you .
what did i do ?
nothing yet .
but we expect great things .
joe riley .
nice to meet you .
i own the three service stations we got in reedsville .
hey son , molly inside ?
uh ... no .
yeah , we ...
actually , she' s ... she' s resting .
what can i do for you boys ?
we want to talk to you about this .
i didn' t know you were a fan .
i' m not going to lie .
i haven' t read a book since johnson was president .
but listen , the library board wanted me to ask you ...
beg ... they said beg .
wanted me to beg you to come to our auction tonight as our featured guest .
an auction ?
byron and i are head of the renovation committee .
you know , new roof , computers ... we just thought , with you in attendance ...
listen .
of all things , your book was a selection for our ladies ' auxiliary book club .
you know , you got a little fan base in town .
little ?
there are 20 blue haired ladies that have read it .
they are ecstatic .
so we came out here to give you a ride if you thought that old truck
wouldn' t make it into town .
" into town ! " hell , it' s not that far .
i don' t know , byron ...
listen , those old bats said if you don' t come they' re setting up celebrity tours here first thing in the morning .
they mean business .
well ...
i guess i do need to gas up the truck .
well , thank you , sir .
it' s good of you to do this .
just do me a favor , and don' t bid on the deer stand .
that baby' s mine .
you coming in to buy something ?
uh ... well , not today .
these spaces in front of my store are for customers only , so why don' t you move your truck to the other side ?
are you still open for business ?
business starts and stops when i say .
now unless you want to come in and ...
i knew your daddy .
this here was his truck .
yeah , well , it' s mine now .
it' s a mixed bag of nuts when family heirlooms get passed down .
some are good things .
and some aren' t so good .
yeah , i can see it in you .
you may not get the shakes like your old man , but you' ve ... you' ve hidden a few bottles under the bed , huh ?
you sound like the kind of guy who' s got the drop on everyone in reedsville .
small towns like this one ... you either know what everyone' s doing , or you choose not to know .
me ?
i guess can you can say i' ve got an eye for the obvious .
well , i tell you what ,
i' il move the truck just as soon as i get back .
all right ?
okay .
i' m sorry .
did i scare you ?
no .
i brought you a towel .
i' il just leave it here for you when you' re ready .
you' re leaving ?
it is a little creepy out here , isn' t it ?
would you like me to stay ?
listen i' m sorry about the parade , son .
folks around here just like to know who everybody is .
gives them a chance to outdo each other on hospitality .
speaking of hospitality , who' s the nazi at the feed store ?
you must mean t. wallace .
tell you to move your truck ?
he took a picture of my license plate .
he' s just mad because this is herman' s show tonight .
our mayor , herman block , he put this whole auction together .
good evening .
they don' t always see eye to eye .
on behalf of the reedsville library governing board , and the library renovation fund ,
i would like to welcome you all to the 4th annual library auction .
first , i' d like to thank our distinguished author in residence for joining us tonight , robert graves .
and so without further ado , our auctioneer and the man behind all this , our mayor , herman block .
thank you so much to our good friend ruth kester .
why don' t we get started ?
our first item here is donated by the reedsville photographic society .
it is a ... a conglomeration of reedsville' s best .
let' s start the bidding at $70 .
how well do you know the mayor ?
why , he' s what we call " old reedsville .
he' d give you the shirt of his back if he didn' t want it no more .
he' s not a bad man . $80 in the back .
i' il introduce you after the show . $85 ! $90 !
ruth , what the hell are you doing ? $90 . $95 ?
95 .
earl' s in the hunt .
don' t you say another word . $100 . $100 .
big earl , come on , baby .
sold , for $100 to ruth kester .
you ever feel like killing somebody ?
my hair was that long once .
why did you cut it ?
it got in the way .
i was catching it in doors and cooking it on the stove .
what ?
um ... my daughter , when she was little , she would lie in bed behind me and twist my hair around her finger .
all night sometimes .
what did she do when you cut it ?
she never knew i did .
herman' s not just a mayor around here , he' s one of our primary property holders .
half of what you see around here , he owns it .
so when it came time to revitalize the town square ,
herman tried to buy t. wallace' s feed store .
t. wouldn' t budge .
he made a fuss in the papers .
but he' s the only one that runs against herman when it comes time for re election .
it gets ugly between those two .
quite a show .
i need more punch .
shit !
when she was born ,
i couldn' t stop thinking about ways i could lose her .
you hear so many stories ... how they just stop breathing in the middle of the night .
my doctor told me it was ... it was natural .
most mothers get obsessed with the worst case scenario .
but in time , it goes away .
and it did .
it did go away .
but now it' s hard to think about anything else .
how i ... how i found her ... in the pool .
when a child drowns , the mother is responsible whether she' s there or not .
but i was there .
i' m to blame .
i have these dreams , these horrible dreams , where i' m ... trapped ... underwater and i can' t breathe .
and there' s nothing i can do but just imagine when ... she was just ...
i' m sorry .
please don' t ... don' t tell robert about this .
i' m doing better .
i swear , i' m ...
i' m doing better .
listen to me , just put one foot in front of the other .
it' s all you can do .
i know .
one foot in front of the other .
robert should be back by now .
all right .
it' s hooked .
so why don' t you tell me again ?
did you see what happened ?
yeah , that' s him .
give me a hand , kendall .
i didn' t see anything .
i heard the confession ...
i heard like , banging and stuff .
we' re just clearing some things up .
what happened to you ?
who' s in the trunk ?
no , no , no .
this little " virgin " act stops right now .
what are you doing ?
molly , stay out of this .
i' ve had enough of this silent treatment .
you two want to lick your wounds , you can do it later .
but right now , i want some answers .
please don' t make me talk about it ...
i count two .
two dead bodies out there .
i killed one of them , that much i know .
but who' s the other guy , rae ?
' cause i don' t remember killing him .
if you want me to leave , i will .
oh you want to go ?
fine , you can go .
wait .
before you do , there' s something i want to show you .
you can let go of me now .
get off me !
you don' t like people touching you ?
what is it ?
where did you get this ?
out of the sheriff' s squad car .
i counted it already .
it' s $200, 000 .
you mean the man you killed ... he was carrying this ?
i think he was buying something .
what ?
ask her .
or do you think maybe i should just show her ?
you want to show her more than anything .
so you can go right ahead .
it ain' t what you think .
that' s the mayor , herman block .
rae , how did this ... how could you allow this ?
allow " ?
you think i allowed this to happen to me ?
is somebody blackmailing the mayor ?
is that what' s happening ?
i don' t want to talk about this ...
did t. wallace take these pictures ?
we just want to understand this , rae .
answer me .
did t. wallace take those pictures ?
robert , let go of her !
rae !
stop !
now you talk to me .
i want to know everything .
who' s behind all of this ?
who' s money is that ?
and who' s in the damn trunk ?
my husband !
he was killed right in front of me .
here .
my husband , robbie butler .
we both grew up across the lake .
somehow that made us inferior to the folks in town .
i always thought the anger that he kept in him would fade over time .
but it didn' t .
well , thank you , fellas .
it' s been a riot .
we were sweet to each other once .
i think over time he grew to hate me .
i just didn' t believe in him anymore .
i didn' t believe in myself much either .
i started working at the mayor' s office just after herman' s wife had her stroke .
she lost the use of both her legs and the left side of her body .
i' d type press statements , estate codes , speeches , " thank you " notes .
the only thing i didn' t do was put my name on them .
that was for mayor block to do .
you' d be amazed at how much paperwork there is for a small town like reedsville , what with everyone knowing each other and all .
corners get cut , laws get overlooked .
ahem ...
mr. block .
i was just about to lock up .
i didn' t know that ...
shh .
it' s okay .
this year hasn' t been very kind to us , has it , rae ?
no , sir .
you know , i' m not a terribly religious man , but there is one verse from the bible that stands out in my mind .
it' s the philippians , chapter four , verse seven .
give you peace , which surpasses all understanding .
give you peace ...
which surpasses all understanding .
when you' ve been without tenderness ... it' s hard to refuse a man' s touch .
any man .
it wasn' t love , but whatever it was ... we needed it .
then it all changed .
what the ?
have a seat , rae !
robbie ...
you see , it seems your wife here has a ... oh , hell , why say anything when a picture tells a thousand words ?
oh .
ooh .
yeah , yeah .
oh , yeah , yeah , yeah .
we got ourselves a disgruntled citizen in town , he fancies himself a shutterbug .
he thought he' d catch mayor block in a ... well , let' s call that a " compromising position .
and now i' ve got to spend my evening running around town paying this guy off , cleaning up herman' s mess when i could be at home watching wrestling .
we some of that " mess " you was talking about cleaning up ?
yeah , you caused the mayor a world of trouble , and it' s time you two disappeared .
you' re a bad man , dodd .
well , maybe you better call the cops .
i got a better idea .
no !
come on !
no !
oh , come on , darling .
oo hoo hoo !
oh !
come on , darling .
i want out to find out what all this fuss is over .
ooh , that' s it , yeah .
whoo hoo hoo !
you know , my mom always said
reedsville looked best in your rear view mirror .
she got that right .
if the truck can run on fumes , i' ve got enough gas to get back into town .
i' il fill her up , come right back here , and then we are gone .
just pack some clothes , that' s it .
can i talk to you for a minute ?
yeah .
are we packing up the shed , too ?
we' il talk about that later .
that sheriff' s car they' re pulling out of the lake
is a few miles from here .
they' il be knocking on our door in no time .
well , we leave , first thing , the three of us .
the three of us , huh ?
something my old man told me once keeps popping back into my head .
what' s that ?
he said the two hardest things in this world to catch is a pop fly at a day game , and a young woman when she' s lying .
you don' t believe her ?
i don' t know .
i mean , her story answers all the right questions , but ...
you saw the sheriff try to kill her , what do you think ?
i think $200, 000 is a lot of money .
i keep waiting for a story to fall in my lap and now i' m looking at this big black bag of cash .
kind of cuts out the middleman with you and me , don' t you think ?
it' s not ours to take , robert .
it' s not hers either .
think about it , molly .
even an even split could pull us out from under .
we need to get rid of it .
i don' t know why you took it in the first place .
you don' t know why i took it ?
jesus , there hasn' t been a day since ashley died you haven' t reminded me that we are broke and life isn' t worth living anymore .
that' s not fair .
no , i spent every penny we had keeping her on life support .
don' t say that .
' cause you couldn' t let go .
they said that there was a chance ...
there was no chance , molly !
jesus , you had it built up in your head that she was coming home .
she was never , ever coming home .
she was brain dead , molly .
the machine was making her breathe , and making her heart beat .
do you think if there was a chance , i wouldn' t hack off my right arm ?
i' d have done anything .
anything .
she was my world too .
i don' t think you believe that .
i can' t do this anymore , molly .
i don' t have the strength for both of us .
i just , i ...
i tried , but ...
i don' t know what you want .
i want you .
i want to be a family again .
what do you want ?
i want to stop fixing things .
i want to stop taking responsibility for everything that goes wrong around me .
i want my life back .
then let me help you .
yeah .
please ?
you know what will help me , molly ?
a big black bag .
a bit too hot for a campfire , don' t you think ?
is that one of your stories ?
yeah , i think it makes a better campfire , though .
you' ve been hiding something from me .
i found this under the couch .
yeah .
my dad' s secret love affair with cut scotch .
i' m sure my mother would have preferred another woman .
it' s not like you can threaten a bottle to leave your man alone .
my daddy drank .
he wasn' t a sad drunk though , he was more happy , like me .
how about you ?
happy or sad ?
where' s molly ?
asleep .
so ... let' s have our talk .
i think it' s best for us not to think about morality ,
more so , justice .
justice ?
in relation to what we got going on in the shed ?
that' s what we' re talking about here .
that' s the issue .
you' re talking pretty fancy .
i' il try to keep up .
civil court is between two people , or two parties who don' t have to prove beyond reasonable doubt because they' re not after blood .
what are they after ?
money ?
money .
you' re just taking the long way around the pond , huh ?
in civil court you just need a preponderance of evidence .
less to prove , right ?
it' s easier to convict .
cigarette ?
nah , i' m burning up already .
so in our situation ...
i mean , it' s not like we can depend on the sovereign city of reedsville to punish the guilty and protect the innocent .
one of their own already tried to kill you .
how can justice prevail ?
you sure sound like you know what you' re talking about .
well ... this is between us and them , right ?
this is a civil matter .
and since the guilty party has already paid with his life , i mean ...
i don' t think you and i should hesitate in seeking punitive damages to the sum of 200, 000 ...
i' m sorry .
there' s just a lot of hot air blowing around .
it' s wonderful in here .
you should come in too .
what about our talk ?
our talk ?
if i was even a part of that conversation
i wouldn' t have gotten in a word edgewise .
we split it .
not three ways , two .
for the last few days it' s been about you and me .
nobody else .
agreed .
see what straight shooting can accomplish ?
you saved my life .
i' il agree to anything you want .
you want to take the money ?
take it .
if you want me ...
no .
that' s not gonna happen .
looking in your eyes i can see you' ve been without tenderness , just like me .
besides , you said we shouldn' t think about morality .
i ca ...
i can' t ...
just relax .
my head .
no , i feel dizzy , i can' t ...
just close your eyes .
you don' t need to see a thing .
no , no , no , no , no , no .
i may be a little old fashioned but we don' t allow our ladies to pump their gas around here .
well , where were you when i needed you ?
oh !
a kiss from a pretty lady so early in the day .
is robert with you ?
i think he' s out on a walk .
he must have gotten up before me .
ah .
peculiar fellows , these writers .
a little bit .
say , would you mind stopping by the library for a bit ?
ruth has a gift for you .
i think she feels bad about not coming up to visit you .
oh , she doesn' t have to do that .
i know , but , you know , she' s an old woman , and once she gets something in her mind , it' s her way or there' s hell to pay .
i understand .
thank you .
hey there .
i was knocking on your door but i guess you weren' t in .
i was down by the lake .
they biting ?
i wasn' t fishing .
i' m abe campbell .
you must be robert graves , our writer in residence .
i was wondering if i could have a talk with you .
can we go inside ?
yeah , okay .
all right .
you live here with your wife , right ?
molly .
right .
where is she at the moment ?
she' s in town getting groceries .
i' m sorry i missed her .
do you hunt ?
uh ... a little bit when i was a kid .
that' s my dad' s old shotgun .
well , it' s old but it' s big enough to drop a buck .
' course most of our deer have gone up north because of the urban sprawl .
price you pay for progress , i suppose .
it' s been a wicked season if you' re into killing .
i' m sorry , mr. graves , i' m gonna have to ask you to come into town with me .
why is that ?
well , i' m kind of hoping we can catch up with your wife .
see , there has been an incident up the lake from here .
something pretty bad .
my orders are to bring the two of you in for questioning .
you' re not the only ones we' ve been talking to , it' s just you' re the last two on my list .
well , you know , she should be home any second now .
it' s important , sir .
i' d appreciate your cooperation .
anything to help .
let me just grab a clean shirt .
all right then .
all right .
you ready ?
i' m ready .
well , i thought whenever you decided to move back east , you might want something to remember us by , so , here you go .
it' s just a collection of pictures .
i thought you' d like ' em .
this is very thoughtful .
thank you , ruth .
let me get that recipe for you .
ruth ?
this woman on the swing , who is she ?
if you mean that black and white one ... that' d be rae butler .
she works over at the mayor' s office .
her skirts run a little high on the thigh for my taste , but her people do come from across the lake , her and that hellion husband of hers .
he sure does take a good picture , don' t you think ?
her husband is a photographer ?
oh , he' s our black sheep , always scamming and stealing .
but mayor block got him a job at the photo lab and he just took off with it like a duck to water .
i think it' s special when a person finds their true calling in life , even of they are a little shifty .
oh , i found it !
molly ?
you want any of this ?
uh , no thanks .
sit down .
how long you and your wife been staying up at your daddy' s cottage ?
we moved in at the beginning of this month .
and this is just for recreational purposes ?
i' m working on a new book .
oh , is that right ?
have you heard anything unusual in the last week ?
no , i haven' t .
do you own any other guns other than the shotgun there ?
no .
and that' s not my gun .
it was my father' s .
i see .
so you' re saying you never fired it ?
no .
i mean , not since i was 12 .
i' m really gonna need to speak with your wife .
well , there' s nothing she can tell you that i can' t .
oh , i don' t doubt that .
it' s just that you live three miles from the scene of a homicide .
a homicide ?
yes , a multiple homicide .
yes , sir .
whoa .
i haven' t heard anything .
these homicides , they ... they happened in the last week .
is there anything you heard that you just can' t explain ?
like what ?
that' s what i' m trying to figure out here .
look , officer ...
i lived in new york most of my life , and if i had heard gunshots , i' d have known what they sounded like .
are you sure ?
i' m positive .
well , that' s kind of strange , don' t you think ?
what' s that ?
well , i didn' t mention gunshots .
i just said homicide .
i think it' s kind of funny you' d just assume that .
well , officer , we did a lot of talking about that rifle there .
i think that' s a pretty fair assumption .
you know what ?
when you put it that way ...
i see your point .
are you sure you don' t want a soda or anything ?
no , thank you .
i' m fine .
you know , i' m just going to see if my associate tracked down your wife at the grocery store .
sit tight .
say ... you ever serve in the army ?
no .
my dad was in korea .
why ?
i was just wondering .
oh , jesus .
oh , no , no , no , the flashlight .
hey !
hey !
he took off ' round back !
robert ?
robert ?
robert ?
where you going , shakespeare ?
ow !
damn it !
son of a bitch .
son of a bitch !
it was you .
you and your husband , you started this .
no .
but we finished it .
or we thought we did .
how could you do that ?
allow your husband to take those pictures of you ?
molly , as grateful as i am for what you' ve done for me ,
i' m sure as hell not gonna stand here and listen to you lecture me on what a husband and wife should and shouldn' t do .
robert didn' t come home last night .
where is he ?
cops came , took him away .
why should i believe you ?
i don' t care , really !
all i know is it' s not going to be long till they come looking for me .
so i need you to tell me where the money is .
it' s in the locker , where it' s always been .
no , it' s not in there , molly !
now tell me where it is .
you tell me where robert is .
you' re like a little house bird .
you know that , molly ?
without somebody taking care of you or that little house you done built up , you could be squashed in a fist .
i' m stronger than you think .
well , try this on .
the last time i saw robert was last night .
and aside from being real drunk , his spirits were real high .
at least that' s what it looked like when i was on top of him and he was on top of me .
inside me .
you' re not strong enough for him , molly .
and i think you know that .
so i don' t think you know where the money is .
' cause you' re not in his thoughts anymore .
you' re not a part of his life .
you' re weak , molly .
you' re nothing but a little , weak ...
get him , t !
damn it , molly , i don' t have time for this .
give it up !
how do you like where i parked my truck ?
huh ? !
huh ? !
take a load off .
why' d you have to beat on him so much ?
he ran .
we went after him .
what' s your problem ?
take off the handcuffs .
i said take ' em off !
byron , the day i take a direct order from you will be the day i lick my own nut sack .
take ' em off .
you heard me , campbell .
take ' em off .
you' il have to excuse the stench in here , mr. graves .
our mutual friend t. wallace insists on keeping the feed store open , despite the fact that there isn' t much of a demand for horse oats anymore .
they just sit back here getting wet and moldy .
it' s a waste of space , t.
i' il be the judge of that .
i suppose you will .
you mind if i sit ?
now don' t be sore at old byron here .
he' s looking out for your best interests , as all of us are .
you see , your daddy was what we' d like to call " old reedsville .
your people are buried up on magnolia hill , same as ours .
so we' ve decided we' d like to claim you , mr. graves , as one of our own .
someone we' d like to take care of .
i can take care of myself .
hmm .
that , uh ... remains to be seen , don' t you think ?
you' re ... bleeding there .
here you go .
now , i' m in a very awkward position .
yeah , i know .
i' ve seen all your positions .
ah .
a reference to the lewd photographs , i suppose , yes .
there' s a few questions i' d like to ask you about those .
yeah ?
why don' t you ask him ?
he' s the one who took ' em .
you mean t ?
well , now , we' ve had our differences over the years , but he would never do something like that to me .
then why is he here ?
well , you killed his brother for one .
sheriff dodd .
he' s the one you shot and sank at the bottom of chitwick lake .
oh .
well , i guess shit doesn' t float after all .
stop it !
hang on , you gotta admit , that was a pretty good one , t.
now , just sit down and relax now .
come on .
son , she' s a bad person .
her and her husband .
they' re the ones that took the pictures .
they' re the ones who started this whole mess .
mm hmm .
now , if you' ve seen those pictures ,
i imagine you also saw a little black bag up there , too .
if rae is up at that cabin i' m concerned about molly' s safety .
she' s a fierce woman , this rae butler .
sweet as a georgia peach , though , i gotta tell you .
of course , i may might be speaking to the already converted .
you' ve ... had a sample of that peach pie now , haven' t you ?
what is it you want from me ?
mr. graves , we' re it .
this is the committee .
we make reedsville happen .
now , if you say you didn' t kill someone , that' s it , you didn' t kill someone .
ain' t that right , t ?
like he said , you can be part of " old reedsville .
byron here' s gonna take you back .
and you will return to us what is rightfully ours .
after that ... it' s over .
done .
finito .
i figure we' ve got enough dirt on each other to keep the playing field fair .
so what , you' re just gonna kill her ?
no .
no , no , no , no , no .
we missed our opportunity at that , unfortunately .
we' re gonna put some cash in her hand and ship that split tailed bitch out on a bus .
robert , we just got to go pick up that money .
just you and me .
after that , all is forgotten .
how do you do it ?
how do you get all these fools wrapped around your finger ?
we take care of our own .
like i said ... we' re " old reedsville .
wait !
wait !
i' m sorry , molly .
i can' t let robert find you like this .
rae !
don' t do this !
i' il tell him where to find you as soon as i get what' s mine .
don' t !
rae ... no !
stop the truck .
i never meant for any of this to happen .
i' ve lived here all my life .
oh , no , i understand .
i mean , you' re just looking out for your own .
i also understand my father loved you .
as much as anyone could' ve been there for him , you were there for him .
go home to ruth .
no !
damn it !
no !
shit !
where is it ? !
so you' re a critic now ?
what happened to you ?
i' ve been hanging out with some of your friends .
good people , really .
where' s molly ?
where' s my money ?
that money buys your life back .
ours , too .
now where is she ?
you like plain talk after all .
i know about you and your husband robbie .
i know what you did .
i' m telling you , robert , you can' t trust any of ' em .
they won' t hesitate in putting a bullet in you and me both .
i' ve had just about enough of this .
robert , can' t you see ?
we just wanted to start over .
we wanted to get away , somewhere where no one knew us .
it' s not like they didn' t get what they wanted .
robert !
please , robert .
i' m not proud about how i earned this , but i earned it .
okay ?
i just ... just want a new life .
isn' t that what you want ?
or maybe you' d like a life with me .
hey !
my life is with molly .
now give me my money .
well , if you' re gonna do it , do it now .
now where' s molly ?
i told you !
didn' t i tell you they' d kill us all ?
i' m gonna throw you out to the dogs unless you tell me where molly is .
if you get us out of this , i swear i' il take you right to her .
you tell me where she is right now !
get down .
we' re gonna put an end to this right now , before it gets out of hand .
i' ve got plenty , but i can only shoot a few at a time .
remember , you' ve only got six rounds , so don' t waste any shots .
i' m sorry , robert .
you don' t deserve this .
yes , i do .
bingo .
jesus !
you' re making me work very hard today .
aah !
you know what ?
i don' t understand you .
the way i see it , i' ve given you everything you have .
that came with a price .
i didn' t have a choice with your precious generosity .
you' re entitled to your opinion , but you are not entitled to this .
you know , i don' t know many girls have patience enough to spend all night getting your dick hard .
you might as well crawl into bed with that screwed up wife of yours ,
' cause you' re dead from the waist down just like she is .
rae , that' s a firearm .
it' s very dangerous .
please don' t point it at me .
give me my money .
rae ... point that in another direction .
give me my money !
okay , all right .
you ... you' ve earned at least ...
you' ve earned that .
you gonna shoot me , rae ?
really ?
then do it .
go ahead .
do it .
i didn' t think so .
herman ?
give you peace which surpasses all understanding .
yeah , i think it goes something like that .
you killed her , didn' t you ?
molly' s dead ?
she' s been dead for a long time , don' t you think ?
i made up my mind .
i wasn' t gonna die in reedsville .
you know , i used to think that too .
at least you got to get out for a while .
i ain' t been east of the rockies .
yeah ?
well , i have .
let me tell you ...
reedsville' s as good a place as any to die .
if you say so .
see ya , robert .
what you doing , molly ?
putting one foot in front of the other .
good for you , molly .
i mean it .
good for you .
oh , baby , i thought i lost you .
oh ...
we' ve survived worse than this .
did you know your typewriter' s broken ?
it' s too bad .
it' s really a ... beautiful place .
i think i' ve seen enough of it .
let' s go home .
where' s that ?
anywhere with you .
