for as long as i can remember , the three of us have always been best friends .
even when we were babies , me , lonnie , and dom shared the same crib .
we were tight , like brothers .
but we all had our own dreams .
g , let me down .
lonnie dreamed of two things .
mmm .
first was that rolonda loved him as much as he loved her .
huh ?
but all she loved was his money .
he also wanted to be a big inventor .
my boy dom .
he just loved the music .
as for me , well , i was built to be a professional athlete .
yeah , i was gonna be the best boxer to come out of south philly since rocky .
i was gonna be the black stallion !
dag , this burns !
oxygen .
$2 tuesday was karate night .
hyah !
sometimes my cousin randall would chill with us .
he had a thing for candyjacking .
i want it chilly up in here !
you now on cha ching' s most wanted list .
that' s why we called him " no good .
we went from boys to men together .
and the three of us moved into lonnie' s uncle virgil' s house .
it was just temporary until we could find a better place .
you have a ride home , xixi ?
yes , father .
don' t be late .
