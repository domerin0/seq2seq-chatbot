perhaps when you get another notice .
hey !

hello ?
hello ?
enough of this idiocy .
who is it ?
i hear you breathing .
you bastard .
hello ?
i' m sorry .
milk wasn' t delivered .
i get it only every other day .
would you like to deliver milk ?
i haven' t time .
neither has the milkman .
he sends you his best wishes ... and " ssla " ... what' s that ?
a code .
he' il see the world .
pity you couldn' t go with him .
i' m not sorry .
from marcin .
what will happen to you when he gets back ?
i' d like to see you settled down .
marcin likes travelling .
i' m afraid he won' t stay home for long .
maybe you could go on living here .
gas emergency .
i want to report a gas leak .
you' re sure of it ?
i can smell it and hear it .
where' s it leaking from ?
the cooker .
what address ?
piratowka , flat 376 .
we' il be there soon .
marcin wrote ... he went to the cinema with an arab girl .
i wonder what they saw .
tomek .
are you seeing somebody ?
no .
i' m not sure whether you have been told this .
girls only pretend to be casual , they kiss boys easily ... but in fact ... they like tenderness .
if you' d like to bring someone here ... you needn' t be shy about it .
i haven' t anyone .
i' il wait .
how are you ?
what do you want ?
i heard you need someone to deliver milk .
do you want to deliver milk ?

i work in our post office .
you realize you must get up at five ?
i get up early , anyway .
hello ?
the milkman .
you didn' t put a bottle out .
that' s right .
son of a bitch !
tomek .
tomek .
not asleep ?
come and sit down .
is something wrong ?
why do people cry ?
don' t you know ?
haven' t you ever cried ?
once , long ago .
when you were left ?
people cry ... for various reasons .
when someone dies , when they' re left alone ...
when they ... can' t stand it anymore .
what ?
living .
when they' re hurt .
can you do anything about it ?
once marcin had toothache he heated the iron and pressed it here .
he forgot about the tooth .
you before , wasn' t it ?
so ?
another notice .
nothing .
it' s the second time .
yes , but there' s nothing .
a mess , eh ?
really ?
could you ask someone more senior ?
what ?
the manager , or someone .
wait a minute please .
what' s the matter ?
i don' t know who' s sent me money , but this is the second notice i' ve had .
no money is here .
you got the notice .
but not any money .
give that notice to me .
who did you expect money from ?
no idea ... 24, 000 ...
so how did you know it was due ?
i got two notices , didn' t i ?
but there' s no money .
so why was i sent notices ?
mr. bachek !
mr. bachek !
what' s the matter , sir ?
what notices are these ?
well , notices .
it' s your round .
did you issue them ?
no , i write in pencil .
they were in my box .
not from us .
but they were in my box , your stamp is on them .
this is a state post office !
if you write your own notices ... it' s a police matter .
right .
give me the notices .
no , they' re forgeries .
you wanted to swindle us .
what do you want ?
i want to tell you there was no money .
what about the notices ?
i sent them .
why ?
i don' t understand .
i wanted to see you .
you wanted to see me ?
you were crying yesterday .
how do you know ?
i peeped at you .
what ?
i watched you through the window .
clear off ... you meddler !
hello .
i' il count to three .
one ...
two ...
hello .
are you looking ?
yes .
i' ve moved the bed , see ?
yes .
have fun .
hey !
you shit !
postman !
come here !
come here , you bastard !
you , sweetheart ?
put up your hands .
don' t do it again .
very unhealthy at your age .
will you sleep ?
i thought it would be you .
want to come in ?
no one' s here .
everything in good order ?
you look terrific .
don' t you know how to fight ?
why are you peeping at me ?
because i love you .
i really do .
and what do you want ?
i don' t know .
do you want to kiss me ?
no .
perhaps you want to make love to me ?
no .
want to go away with me ?
to the lakes , or to budapest ?
no .
so what do you want ?
nothing .
nothing ?
yes .
could i invite you out to a cafe ... ice cream ...

i love you .
there' s no such thing .
there is .
no .
apart from loving me and working in the post office , what do you do ?
i study languages .
what have you learned ?
bulgarian .
bulgarian ?
great , but what for ?
we had two bulgarians in the orphanage .
then english , french , italian .
now i' m learning portuguese .
you' re a strange one .
no , i have a good memory .
i remember everything from the start .
even when you were born ?
i think so , sometimes .
and your parents ?
not them .
remember a thin boy who used to visit me in the autumn ?
yes , he brought milk and rolls and took away parcels .
that' s right .
he never came back .
i liked him .
so did i , but he left ... for austria , then australia .
australia ?
yes .
i' ve been removing your letters .
i didn' t know they were from him .
i work at the post office .
you besiege me , you bring the milk you send me false notices ... you send gas workers , you pinch my letters .
but it doesn' t really matter .
haven' t you any friends ?
one , but he' s not here now .
where is he ?
he' s with the un force in syria .
i lodge with his mother , opposite .
he' s different from me .
i think so .
he peeped at you , too .
what did he tell you ?
before he left he showed me your window and gave me his opera glasses .
what did he tell you ?
ssla .
what' s it stand for ?
go ahead .
she ...
she ?
quickly !
she spreads it around .
that' s okay .
what would you like ?
i don' t like ice cream .
but i' il eat .
i' il have ice cream .
it' s off .
what , then ?
tea .
we' ve got that .
i' d like red wine .
two glasses of red wine , and tea .
okay .
give me your hand .
caress me .
look there !
they seem to know more about it .
our bus .
i have a good idea .
if we catch it , you' re coming to my place .
if not , no .
agreed ?
let' s go !
such snow scenes are embroidered , too .
do i always do that ?
not that i' ve seen .
not everything' s routine .
where did you get that ?
it' s a souvenir .
it' s yours now .
i' m not good .
don' t give it to me .
you know i' m not good .
really .
i don' t care .
i love you .
what else do you know ?
what do you see when one of them is with me ?
it' s called ... making love .
i don' t watch that any more .
it has nothing to do with love .
tell me what i do .
you undress .
then you undress them .
you go to bed , or on the floor .
and ?
or in the kitchen .
you close your eyes ... then you lift your hands ... above your head .
show me how .
go on .
have you had a girl ?
no .
and when you watch me do you do it with yourself ?
i used to .
not now .
you know it' s sinful .
now ...
i think only about you .
i have nothing underneath you know , don' t you ?
when a woman wants a man ... she becomes wet inside .
i' m wet now .
such delicate hands .
don' t be afraid .
already ?
that' s all there is to love .
wash in the bathroom there' s a towel .
i' m sorry .

i' d like to visit him .
he just left my place ...
i know .
i think that ...
i have hurt him .
don' t visit him , he will be back .
what happened ?
you' il probably find it funny .

he used opera glasses before .
and he set this alarm clock for half past eight .
