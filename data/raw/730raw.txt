hey , you little girl !
hey , give me a break !

stop staring .
you' il sprain your eyes .

anyway , what brings you here ?
missed me so that you had to skip school ?
no , it' s the school' s anniversary .
i was forced to come here .
i' m wasting my time when i really have to study .
yeah , there' s only 2 years left to the national exam .
but people like you really make college look undesirable .
what do you mean ?
you' re a pervert and a playboy .
i may be a playboy , but not a pervert .
here' s your present .
just for you , keep it a secret to the family .
okay .
pretty , isn' t it ?
it' s padded .
real thick .
you' re a pervert !
should i help you put it on ?
should i ?
want me to punch you ?
my son !
my son' s home !
how have you been ?
welcome home .

i made it myself , just for you , grandfather .

no one but you can take such good care of me .
of course , i' m your only granddaughter .

i' d be married in the old days .
right grandfather ?
absolutely .
a married woman .
sangmin , come sit here .
yes , grandfather .
you two , hear me out .
you may have heard this story before ,
sangmin' s grandfather was an old friend and war comrade
when we were young , we made a pact .
to marry our kids .
but you two had only sons .
so , our pact was passed down to the next generation .
i hope you two can keep this promise .
what are you saying ?
you idiot !
grandpa wants you to marry sangmin !
marriage ?
you must be joking grandpa !
marry sangmin ?
hey !
your grandpa' s not kidding !
i can die peacefully after you two get married !
this way i can face sangmin' s grandpa .
how can a high schooler get married !
anyone over 15 can marry with their parent' s consent .
i haven' t much time left , you know ?
no , i won' t .
never !
sorry grandpa but i' il forget what you just said .
he hasn' t finished speaking !

yeah .
i' m really worried .

come on , let' s just marry the kids .
let go .
come on ...
this is sangmin' s grandparents .
soon after this picture was taken , war broke .
want me to tell you a secret ?
secretly , your grandpa had feelings for sangmin' s grandma .
she was quite a beauty .
however , after sangmin' s grandpa' s death ,
i tucked those feelings away .
that' s why i took care of sangmin' s father like my own son .
your father may not have been so happy about this .
boeun !
yes ?
keeping this promise is the most important thing for me .
grandpa !
grandpa !
grandpa , wake up .
grandpa !
you can' t die !
open your eyes , grandpa !
grandpa , i' il get married so open your eyes , grandpa !
i' il keep your promise , grandpa !
i' il get married ...
are you crying ?
stop crying .
you may be behind in your grades , but you' re the nation' s first to get married .
congrats , missus .
right .
scared that sangmin will discover your lop sided butt ?
a butt that needs cushioning to keep it on balance ?
hey , get out !
ouch , it hurts !
i' m sorry boeun , for not being much help .
mom , am i really getting married ?
what about school ?
i have to go to college ...
marriage won' t change anything .
marriage , accept it with grace .
it' s nothing .
just consider you' re getting a new brother .
i' m scared that they' il find out at school .
how will i face everyone ?
don' t worry .
grandpa will take care of it .
your grandpa was your principal' s military senior .
really ?
behold the face of a wolf who' il eat up a 15 year old virgin .
is it satisfaction or disbelief ?
satisfaction , of course .
shit , are you really my friends ?
i can' t be married at this age .
to sangmin !
cheers
the chicks here are hot !
let' s go out on the floor !
hello .
you' re here .
thanks .
you' re here .
sir !!
yes , come in .
over here .
i won' t forget this .
how could our field trip be at the same time ?
i know .
you shouldn' t keep it from your other friends .
if they found out , the whole school will know .
then i' d have to quit school .
anyway , you' re so pretty today .
i wish i could get married too .
look here !
hey , smile !
how are you doing ?
hello .
don' t take my picture .
okay , okay .
good luck !
i' m convinced that grandpa scammed me .
boeun , it' s just a wedding , okay ?
i can' t do it , mom !
now , don' t be a baby .
i' m nervous myself .
i' m telling grandpa .
i can' t do it !
do you want your wedding turned into a funeral ?
i don' t know .
i' m scared , mom .
what am i going to do with such a baby ?
now the groom will enter .
welcome him with a big applause .
the groom , please enter !

respectable guests , family and relatives .
we are all gathered here to congratulate the new beginning of groom , park sangmin and bride , suh boeun ...
dad , we' il be okay .

what' s your point ?
i know i can trust you .

boeun is still in high school !
i don' t care !
i' il do as i wish with my wife .
boeun , don' t worry .

she' s not going far away .
let' s have some faith , okay ?
besides , our in laws love boeun like their own daughter .
but , she' s not their own daughter .
i can understand dad and you , but i still can' t forgive you for it .
okay , okay , that' s enough ... enough ...
without boeun , it seems like there' s a big hole in my heart .
everyone looks like boeun , that one too ...

i hate to admit it , but we' ve done a horrible job .
it' s okay .
really ?
let' s wash our hands and grab some snacks .
are you taking care of sangmin' s meals ?
it' s really hard to be an intern you know .
it couldn' t be that hard !
hey , but he' s your husband .
hey , i' m busy myself .
and he' il never skip a meal .
what kind of wife are you ?
then you be his wife .
mrs. park sangmin .

i couldn' t believe it myself !

we' il be painting until dawn .

she' s the queen of sunil girls ' middle school .
hey , let me see .
hey !
i' m going to make a move on her , so nice shots , please .
okay .
just don' t get blown off .
from this day on , she' s suh dongku' s woman !
excuse me , but , aren' t you going to sunil girls ' middle school ?
hey !
over there .
isn' t that dongku' s sister ?
where ?
it really is his sister .
her husband looked older than that ...
then , who' s that ?
she must' ve fallen for a younger dude .
nice .
the whole family' s fooling around !
i got her number .
did you get a good shot ?
here .
come to the monthly famlly dlnner before it' s too late .
jungwoo , i have to go home .

it' s okay .
let' s eat .
the chilli squid was great ...
attention , please .
i' il now show you my girlfriend !
do you have a girlfriend ?
yes , of course .
now take a good look .
that' s her ?
she' s better than your sister .
hey , look ... look ...
who' s that ?
huh ?
hey , boeun !
hey !
boeun !
when you were little ,
i always pushed you on this swing here .
you really loved it .
but one day , you fell off the swing while i was pushing .
i actually did it on purpose .
i' m sorry , sangmin ...
everyone will be worried .
let' s go .
this marriage ... it seems like your grandpa forced you into it , but in fact we wanted to have sangmin as our son in law .
do you remember ?
how often you would cry ?
but whenever sangmin came , a smile would spread on your face .
you would fall all the time .
scraping and breaking yourself .
sangmin felt worse than i did .
he carried you on his back all the time , that sangmin .
anyway , i envy you .
the way he spends more time on your school festival than his graduation exhibition ,
i guess he' s gone to paint the wall with yongju and youngchul ...
sangmin !
sangmin !
sangmin !
i came with the family to see you , but an emergency at your squad forces me to turn away .
are you doing well ?
a few days ago , heavy snow came down in seoul .
the han river is frozen as well ...
it' s colder here , right ?
don' t catch cold .
and this is a secret but my mom says that i' ve become a woman now .
i' m a bit behind than the other girls , but being an idiot that you are , you won' t understand what i mean , will you ?
it' s strange but when you were around , i hated your guts , but your absence has me missing you .
are you feeling the same ?
then be good to me from now on .
stupid .
the disappointment of not being able to meet you has your mom crying .
anyway , this letter , i hope it reaches you .
where have you been ?
i' ve been looking all over for you .
the wall' s great .
i ... have something to say .
yeah , what ?
i' m sorry .
i' ve been so selfish .
to you and ...
what' s got into you ?
i' m breaking up with you .
i' m sorry , jungwoo .
people laugh and dance but i hate to laugh
while we drink and search for love , we forget about the truth
why are you late ?
did you see him ?
who ?
your husband or boyfriend ?
i' m not kidding !
there he is .
i like the smiling clown yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah
i like the clown who embraces sadness
aren' t they great ?
now , intern , park sangmin will share a few words with us .
i thank everyone , the principal , all the teachers ... and all the students for helping me finish this internship in one piece .
it may have been a short time , but personally , it has left me with precious memories i will carry for the rest of my life .
mr. intern , cut the boring crap and show us some honestly .
mr. park sangmin is a married man .
didn' t you know ?
of course , it' s not a sin to be married .
but in fact you' re married to a 15 year old high school girl , right ?
to suh boeun who' s sitting right there ...
correct .
we are married .
but boeun had no choice .
the only crime she' s committed was granting her sick grandfather' s last wish .
it was against her will to marry me .
she may be married , but she' s still a 15 year old high school girl .
she goes crazy over a bowl of chilli and spaghetti .
she loves cute stars and kimbap loving attractive baseball players .
everyday , she' s stressed over exams , and applying to university .
i hope you won' t persecute boeun' s school life over a marriage document .
i beg you all .
sangmin , i' m not a kid anymore .
since i was little , you were always at my side .
i was never aware of the strange feelings ... inside ... but ...
i think i' m in love with you ...
our poor dongku .
she' s the end of all your fun and play .
fun and play ...
i knew it since he was fixed on that school queen or whatever ...
i can' t believe grandpa fell for her grandmother .
i can' t believe it ...
she looks bright though .
just consider it starting early !
do it !
do it !
oh , shut up and peel the garlic .
i' m in no position to say this , but you can hide a lop sided butt , but not lop sized balls .
anyway , congrats .
it' s good that she doesn' t have a clue .
who would marry a lop sized ball man if they knew , right ?
right .
oh , you' re here !
oh , dad !
you' re here .
i' m really getting into peeling these things ...
did you get married to peel garlic ?
mom !
okay !
say cheese .
one , two , three !!
