it' s so shiny real , it hurts the eyes .
the dead man was identified as scott gates , 20 years old , unemployed and homeless .

a young man has been found frozen to death here in inwood park .
you saw this no face prop the body in the tree ?
that' s right .
but you were in there in your bed the whole time ?

yeah , sure .
look , i know this guy .
i' ve seen him around .
he' s completely delusional .

take it easy , pal , we' re just having a little chat .
don' t touch my daughter , squashface .

your daughter ?
this man is your father ?
why didn' t you say something ?
maybe i don' t meet her momentous expectations .
but i' m still a witness .
i know who the murderer is .
now you write it !
write what ?
the name of the murderer , which you already know .
cornelius gould stuyvesant , now write it !
daddy !
tell him to write it .
i can' t tell him anything , he' s my boss .
hey , what the hell , pal , that' s the way i like ' em , open and shut .
how do you spell stuyvesant ?
you know how to spell it .
aah !
go ahead and kill me .
for christ' s sake , rom .
i' m dead already .
matthew ?
it' s you who found him , wasn' t it ?
found who ?
scotty .
he knew they were going to kill him .
matthew , you' re shivering .
i don' t care .
you' re too cold .
i loved him , rom .
i wanna die too .
okay .
okay .
not right now , okay ?
come on .
they killed him , rom .
he was just too beautiful for them .
ah , god , rom , wasn' t wasn' t he beautiful ?
he was dead when i saw him .
yeah , but you met him .
the dead kid ?
i don' t think so .
well , he knew you .
he said you weren' t afraid to speak the truth .
no shit , rom .
he called you " the voice .
he did ?
he was just a kid .
he was fucking innocent till that bastard got his fucking hands on him .
stuyvesant ?
stuyvesant ?
david leppenraub .
who ?
david leppenraub .
don' t you know , rom ?
the photographer ?
i mean , he' s fucking famous .
he does these pictures of angels , and everyone' s always going on about how beautiful leppenraub' s angels are .
and , yeah , they' re beautiful because they' re scotty .
scotty was leppenraub' s model ?
he was his fucking slave .
he was so ashamed of the pictures , he wouldn' t even show them to me .
that bastard took him up to his farm , tortured him , got him strung out on dope .
he he even branded him , rom .
he burned a heart on scotty' s ass .
and then when he was done with him , he threw him away , like a fucking piece of trash .
i found him on the street like that , you know ?
i didn' t care .
he was still beautiful .
he was beautiful to me .
but he couldn' t let it go , you know ?
all the shit that happened to him .
he kept telling me that he had this tape of the torture .
he was going to get a bunch of money from leppenraub for it .
that' s what got him killed .
you tell the cops this , matthew ?
come on , rom , look at me .
who do you think they' re going to believe , huh ?
me ?
or the great david leppenraub ?
what sins have you committed ?
y rays .
they' re listening .
there' s nothing you can do , matthew .
you and me , we' re too small .
he knows that .
he likes that .
you know him ?
you know leppenraub ?
i don' t have to know him .
i know the man he works for .
you have any any sins to confess , my child ?
come on , rom , i feel ridiculous enough .
you can call me daddy , no one listening .
what are we doing here , daddy ?
suppose l i told you i knew who killed scotty gates ?
you did tell me and my boss .
just just hear me out .
suppose i told you that scotty gates was killed by a very famous artist ?
and suppose i found a way to slip you his name ?
david leppenraub ?
you you know about leppenraub ?
apparently , everybody knows about leppenraub .
scotty gates was going all over town crying how leppenraub had abused him .
so what ?
i think the same thing about my employer .
he told everyone he was going to get revenge .
so , lieutenant cork made a call , and leppenraub said , yeah , gates had tried to blackmail him , and he politely told scotty to go to hell .
and then he politely murdered him .
there' s no evidence of that .
hell , there' s a body in the tree .
daddy , gates was a nutcase .
no offense .
but he was running around in the middle of winter with no shirt .
everyone thought he was going to freeze to death .
we think it' s reasonable for us to assume that that' s what happened .
very , v very reasonable , except for one thing .
what' s that ?
he was murdered .
daddy , you live in a cave .
you watch the news on a tv that' s plugged into nothing .
you think there' s a guy on top of a tower that' s trying to take over the world .
you' re not well .
why don' t you let me get you some help ?
and just who would you get to help me , lulu ?
just just who you got in mind for your old man ?
rom , l i got to get back to work .
that what you call it , lulu ?
you call that work ?
terrorizing innocent people while murderers roam the streets like rats , huh ?
and you ashamed of me .
i should be ashamed of you !
you tell your boss he can' t snake this one over on me .
tell him he can' t kill me , ' cause i' m reaching for my wallet .
he can' t torture me with his anal broomsticks .
you tell stuyvesant i' m going to tear his tower down !
you
bored ?
depressed ?
tired ?
need a lift ?
an added dimension ?
baby girl , baby girl , i got what you need .
fuckin ' taste , man .

' cause i can teach you .
you stinkin ' motherfucker .
yo , yo , got that come here , i got the smoke with me .
roll with me , roll with me .
matthew , come on .
you you said there was a tape , right ?
yeah .
yeah .
of the torture ?
and leppenraub made it ?
yeah , he made it .
so sick , he liked watching it .
but the guy running the camera , he wasn' t into it .
just doing what he was told .
so he made a copy of the tape for scotty .
i guess he thought he was doing him a favor .
protecting him .
so now leppenraub has the tape back ?
i don' t know .
but the cameraman , he must have the original , right ?
so what' s his name ?
where can we fiind him ?
how am i supposed to know ?
why don' t you ask leppenraub ?
so , now you think you' re a detective ?
i got eyes , sheila , i can see things other people can' t .
like me ?
you still think i look like this after all these years ?
you' re no smarter than when i married you , are you ?
i' m gonna fiind the evidence , sheila .
i' m gonna nail this leppenraub bastard .
ah , baby , if your shit was a rocket ship , you could go to the moon .
now why you gotta stick your nose in matters ... that do not pertain to you , and don' t give me some bullshit about love .
the dead boy knew me , sheila .
he called me " the voice .
it' s lulu , isn' t it ?
you wanna prove yourself to her ?
you wanna win her respect ?
try soap and hot water .
try getting a job .
that' s just what stuyvesant wants , isn' t it ?
get a shave , get a job , relax .
well , not this time , sheila , because stuyvesant left that valentine outside my door .
he thinks he got to me this time by leaving that particularly nasty , fucking insult .
it pisses me off .
sir ?

it' s like an oven in here .

poeme divin ' s okay .

nothing but a dominant ninth , few hocus pocus suspensions .
play the f sharp it' s " g , " the " a " is b flat .
you see what i mean ?
you can' t impose divinity on a chord .
a chord' s divinity has to come from the inside out .

well , this therapist i' ve been seeing ... thinks it' s because we don' t want to surpass our fathers .
romulus ?
rom !
great lips , where does it all go ?

i can put a match in my mouth ... and when the lights are out , i light up like a jack o ' lantern .
the man does not promote me right .
tell her about the time you burned a hole in your tongue .
juvenile bullshit .
sheila , what are you doing here ?
watching you make a fool of yourself .
what are you doing here ?
i have to prove leppenraub' s guilty .
prove to who ?
to the world .
to lulu .
lulu needs a father , not some psycho sherlock holmes .
you' re gonna get yourself in deep shit .
look at her .
like a cat itching to get scratched .
you better watch your back , baby .

# [ opera ]
man on a horse .
i was at this exhibit , and it was basically penises big , small , fat , skinny all in pastel .
no , thank you .
don' t you watch me !
joey !
could you be a little less conspicuous , please ?
sorry .
please excuse him , mr. ledbetter .
he' s a filmmaker .
i can' t seem to get rid of him .
he' s a filmmaker .
i can' t seem to get rid of him .
apparently , some people fiind my life terribly interesting .
i' m david leppenraub .
i' m honored to have you here .
and and i to be here .
i was very flattered to hear that my work inspires you .
oh , well .
why ?
excuse me ?
why do you like my work ?
well this one .
what do you think ?
what do i think ?
that' s what i asked .
it' s empty .
empty ?
so empty , it hurts the eyes .
you see , the angel is is looking heavenward , b but he can' t see because stuyvesant has sucked out his soul and just left a shell .
he' s empty .
so empty it hurts .
now that i like , amigo .
it hurts the eyes .
watch your head .
does it hurt , mr. ledbetter ?
it' s supposed to .
all great art is born of suffering .
tell me what you feel .
in what dark , damaged place does it infect you ?
deep , ancestral , primordial pain .
shame , fear that' s what my work is all about .
fear and transcending fear .
guts versus fear .
it' s really all there is .
i' m told i' m something of an expert on fear .
let me show you this .
my latest .
what' s your verdict ?
guilty .
and your evidence ?
don' t have any .
not yet .
that' s a different kid , isn' t it ?
it' s not the same model who' s in the other shots , right ?
you are perceptive .
most people can' t tell .
that' s joey , the asshole with the video camera .
my regular model had vertigo , and i needed him up in a tree , but heights made him twitchy .
is that right ?
who was your regular model ?
he doesn' t work for me anymore .
joey took his place .
really ?
what happened to him ?
what difference does it make ?
right , what difference does it make ?
after all , they' re just bodies .
i mean , after the body' s done , just chuck it , hang it from a tree .
you playing some kind of game with me , amigo ?
this stuff could go out of fashion real quick , right ?
people find out the real story , they don' t want it in their house .
who the hell are you ?
suddenly , it' s not worth millions
what do you want ?
you want to blackmail me too ?
stuyvesant wouldn' t like that .
what' s this stuyvesant shit ?
what' s this murder shit ?
i don' t know who the hell you are , but you listen , i loved scotty gates .
oh , i bet you did .
like a son .
why' d he run around telling people you tortured him ?
because he went crazy .
why ?
how the hell should i know , i wasn' t even here .
i had an opening in cologne .
when i came back , he was gone .
his boyfriend broke up with him , maybe that was it .
love , it gets in your head .
not yet !
love ... it it will it will do that to you .
look ...
i owe you an apology .
i' m i' m sorry .
l i heard these rumors .
that' s all right .
i suppose it' s just part of being who i am .
wild envy surrounds me ... and rumors .
too many goddamned rumors .
one of them actually had the nerve to call my work ...
victim art . " [ chattering , laughter ]
trying to believe these stories of oppression and cruelty .
does it hurt ?
i like you , romulus .
it' s too bad you can' t be with us longer .
excuse me ?
well , let me rephrase .
if the price of rapture ... is a mountain of suffering , shouldn' t the fee be paid ?
so long as nobody gets hurt .
so long as nobody gets hurt .
i like that .
my brother likes to hear himself talk .
you' il get used to it .
excuse me .
he died of fright , didn' t he ?
mr. ledbetter , is now a good time ?
for what ?
to shoot you .
i guess now is as good a time as any .
wow .
you' re really scared of the camera , aren' t you ?
camera ?
i' m wanting to do a quick interview , so you can talk about whatever you like .
where ?
i do a lot of taping there in the coach house .
is that where you made the video of scotty ?
what ?
come on , joey , you know what i' m talking about .
look , there' s there' s no tape , man .
that' s just a rumor .
but you know better , right ?
because you made it .
shh .
please .

mm mm .
well , how come you know about the tape ?
a friend of scotty' s told me about it .
you were a friend of scotty' s , weren' t you ?
scotty' s dead , man .
but he still needs justice , right , joey ?
look , i don' t want to talk about scotty now .
please .
you' re scared .
you' re scared of your boss .
please !
they' il hear us .
you don' t know .
well , why you so scared ?
because i' ve seen what he can do .
you can' t imagine .
wh where' s the tape ?
romulus ?
it' s safe .
i' ve been looking everywhere for you .
it' s time .
time for what ?
piano time .
i haven' t started yet .

just get from this side of the piece to the other .
# [ vocalizing ]
what ?
what is it ?
what am i smelling in this place ?
there' s some foulness here .
the smell of mendacity and evil .
what is this stench ?
is it the rotting boy delivered outside my cave ?
is that what i' m smelling ?
the sweet valentine you delivered ?
what is this reek ?
is it the smell of torture ?
the brand burning his flesh ?
is that what i smell ?
it' s all of you , isn' t it ?
it' s the smell of your heartless art and your bone dry theories ,
like last week' s vomit .
and the heart has vamoosed from this culture long ago .
and anybody gets wind of that you tortured him , killed him and you make a videotape of it and call it art .
i won' t have this .
you hang the body from a tree to teach the caveman a lesson .
and you burn the caveman' s eyes out with blue skies and green ducks !
green ducks !
get your hands off me !
i haven' t found the clue yet !
you lied to me .
you' re still in that cave , aren' t you ?
and you won' t get me out of that cave , either .
you can' t matchbox me !
stuyvesant !
we' re going to bring your tower down !
stuyvesant !
get out of here .
lao tse , what is it ?
what is it , you dumb dog ?

lao tse !
romulus ?
lao tse , come here .
you scared the shit outta me .

yes .
why' d you leave the party ?
i hate those parties .
what the hell happened to you ?
your your brother' s hit man tried to run me over .
photographers do not have hit men , romulus .
yeah , well you tell that to the no face with the gun .
you' re psychotic , aren' t you ?
l i have brain typhoons .
brain typhoons ?
swarms of moth seraphs howl in my skull .
lies vex them .
then you' il understand if i don' t invite you in .
mm hmm .
your brother tortured scotty .
that is a vicious rumor .
and when scotty started to spread the word around , your brother had him killed .
david loved scotty .
not what scotty says .
scotty had a nervous breakdown .
he was a dope fiiend .
who made him a dope fiiend ?
go on , girl , go on out .
come in here .
scotty was a junkie when we met him .
david likes damaged souls .
he says they make better subjects .
if it were true , if david hurt scotty in any way , believe me , i would have known all about it .
scotty and i were friends .
i was devoted to him .
what are you doing ?
looking for clues .
what kind of clues ?
well , this is the place that they did the shows , right ?
the torture shows ?
oh , god .
don' t be scared .
it' s not real .
it' s all fake , rom .
it' s an illusion .
he uses prosthetics , clay , wax , all these props .
none of it' s real .
david says he wants to " provoke the viewers ,
none of it' s real .
david says he wants to " provoke the viewers , set off tremors in the subconscious , " i don' t fucking know .
s see , what' s that ?
what ?
that that looks like real blood .
it is .
it' s yours .

y rays are tax collectors and police brutality and drug wars ... and backed up toilets .

z rays are green and soft ...
like moonlight and seductive and ... much more vicious .
z rays smell like a rich man' s bank account .
they smell like success .

l i' m the one that found the body .
the homeless guy ?
not homeless .
i live in a cave .
so what the fuck you doing here ?
what if he saw you here ?
scotty asked me to help him before he was killed .
he asked me to help , and and i didn' t .
so what , you feel guilty ?
you feel like it' s your fault ?
your fault .
jesus christ .
j joey .
joey .
what d did he do to scotty ?
listen .
i came here ... because i thought david leppenraub ... was the greatest artist of the human psyche who had ever lived .
that he knew all about suffering .
what attracts us to it , you know ?
why we seem to reach out to it .
i wanted to be one of his disciples .
carry his cameras , fiilm him , do whatever he wanted .
whatever he asked , i did .
so did scotty .
except once .
up in that tree .
see , scotty was scared of heights .
david wanted to tie him to that branch , but no amount of dope would make him do it .
give me your hand .
i can' t .
let go of the tree .
give me your hand .
it' il be fiine .
i can' t .
i can' t let go .
would you just trust me , please ?
david , please , i' m scared .
i want you to be scared .
come on , we' re losing the light .
i can' t !
scotty , if you damage that fucking cage ,
i swear i will throw you out of this tree !
but , david , he' s terrifiied .
get down , you pussy .
get out of the fucking tree !
joey , take off your clothes .
you' il pose this one .
scotty , get down .
i' m going , and i' m not coming back either .
where are you going to go , scotty ?
you' re never going to touch me again .
i' m gonna tell everyone what you did to me .
are you ?
so , he came down , and i went up .
and i was the crucifiied angel .
greatest moment of my life .
i got to be inside leppenraub' s vision .
you have no idea what that meant to me .
and and scotty ?
i never saw him again .
wanna know what i think ?
i think he brought him here .
i think he had scotty in the freezer .
i think he froze him to death .
give me the tape .
why ?
we can fiight him , go to the cops .
we can' t fiight him .
there' s no evidence .
the tape !
against david' s lawyers ?
they' d rip it to shreds .
you don' t understand .
you can' t fiight him .
you can' t run from him .
you can' t just give up .

i need you to believe me .
i need you to believe me .
leppenraub foundation , can i help you ?
i have a message for david leppenraub .

and if he wants it , i' il sell it to him .

they will have killed me .
and you' il know that everything i' ve been saying is true .

moth seraphs of divinity of vengeance , i need you .

am i ?
it' s all right .
really ?
we' re not shot ?
you' re alive .
i' m alive .
how can that be ?
he wasn' t aiming at us .
he was trying to fiinish off his partner here .
operator , this is officer ledbetter , new york city police department .
i' m at ward' s island playground .
i need a bus forthwith .
i have a perp shot and the other perp fled over the footbridge .
he' s armed with a gun .
send backup forthwith .
shaker .
you know him ?
mm hmm .
shaker .
it' s matthew' s dealer .
we' re looking for the one that got away .
we fiigured they must have overheard you and matthew on a street , talking about this valuable tape and decided they wanted some of the action .
how' s he connected to leppenraub ?
caveman , come here .
you see that pack of vermin down there ?
if leppenraub' s name comes into this , no more quiet investigation , no more slowly building a case , just fuckin ' weasels everywhere you step .
listen , caveman , this is detective business .
all due respect , maybe it' s not for you .
maybe you need what' s called a " rational mind .
yeah , m maybe maybe you' re right .
i should leave the police work to you .
meanwhile , i' il give my fiirst press conference .
oh , fuck !
caveman , what do you want from me ?
the autopsy report on scotty gates .
your daughter dropped it off this morning .
knock yourself out .
it says , " the the ' periorbital ' spaces ... are are free of extravasated blood and edema .
it says , " the the ' sclerae ' ...
are an
' anicteric . " '
what it doesn' t say is anything about a brand .
matthew says scotty was was branded .
blood red valentine on his butt .
why didn' t the autopsy mention that ?
it' s just gone ?
vamoosed ?
how' d it do that ?
what the hell' s stuyvesant up to now ?
did you fuck scotty gates ?
did you come all the way up here to ask me that ?
mm hmm .
why ?
i have to know .
if you fucked him , then you saw his butt , right ?
right ?
i guess so .
then , you could tell me if if there' s a heart brand on his butt .
a heart ?
i guess i could .
if i saw his butt .
but ...
i didn' t see his butt .
' cause i didn' t fuck him ,
' cause he' s gay among other things .
do you think that i fuck everybody , rom ?
you you said you were devoted to him .
a different kind of devotion .
hello , romulus .
it' s nice to see you again .
hi , moira .
you know , it' s , um , it' s interesting that you mention this heart thing .
i have a little confession to make .
you got what i want ?
got a little atonement for me , master ?
does it hurt ?
it' s supposed to .
it' s not over yet .
' course not, joey .
' cause it' s not his money you' re after , is it ?
what are you doing here ?
you want the glory , a little recognition , and he denied you .
did you tell him that ?
i did treat you somewhat shabbily .
that time you took scotty' s place up in the tree ,
i know i wasn' t appreciative enough .
he didn' t even acknowledge it was you .
he passed you off as scotty .
i scoffed at your ambitions .
he didn' t see your genius .
and that twisted your brain around in its socket , right , joey ?
' cause ' cause you' re a great artist .
you' re a genius .
the master of suffering .
and yet , he called you a faker .
soft .
soft as a pillow .
never experienced real pain .
you don' t know what pain is .
why the fuck did you talk to him ?
so , one day , you decided you were going to show leppenraub ... who the real master was .
so , you took scotty in the big freezer , and you made your own art .
you froze him to death .
are you saying i killed scotty gates ?
masterpiece of suffering .
you' re schizo .
scotty was nuts .
he was homeless , that' s why he froze to death .
everybody saw him .
everybody saw you !
that wasn' t scotty gates running around the village , that was you .
you' re so beautiful .
you figured if leppenraub could pass you off as scotty , then then you could too .
you played the victim , but the victim was the killer .
it' s brilliant, joey .
you' re radiant .
you radiate z rays .
this is bullshit !
then you took the tapes you' ve made , and you you put leppenraub' s voice on them from your interviews .
all that stuff he' s been spouting , you put it all in .
does it hurt ?
it' s supposed to .
but they were just words strung together .
you twisted them so you could blackmail leppenraub .
i told you to keep your mouth shut !
meanwhile ,
you were watching me .
you set me up .
and when you were ready , you you left your valentine outside my cave .
' cause you knew i' d go around ranting about the evil david leppenraub .
the cops ?
they wouldn' t believe me .
the rumors would scare the hell out of leppenraub , so you became my nightmare .
you played me .
you knew all my chords .
you thought the no faces could control me , but i' m a free man !
you' re insane !
you' re a lunatic !
and you' re a fucking genius !
tell him .
tell him .
tell him about the little moths that live inside your head .
they' re not moths !
they' re moth seraphs .
the moth seraphs of divinity and vengeance !
and they' re sick and tired of your lies and your deceit !
and they' re gonna fly you straight to hell !
look at him !
he' s a lunatic !
do you really think he was going to help you , you asshole ?
if this is what you got , you got nothing !
scotty ?
scotty !
you set me up , you fuckhead ?
you' re supposed to be dead .
scotty , they said you were dead .
get your hands off me , you stupid faggot !
you' re gonna die now , caveman .
joey !
drop the gun , police !
police !
get down !
matthew !
matthew !
you never knew scotty gates .
how did you do it ?
how the hell did you know ?
so , how did you know ?
his heart .
matthew said that scotty had a heart branded on his butt .
but it wasn' t in the angel pictures , and it wasn' t in the autopsy report .
so , i asked moira .
' cause i thought maybe she had sex with scotty .
so , i asked her about the heart , and she said of course she remembered .
but not on scotty , on joey .
moira had sex with joey .
yep .
with me too .
these are good .
can i have another ?
maybe you should slow down .
why did you let joey have so much power over you ?
you could have called his bluff .
i mean , the police would have known the tape was a fake .
he wouldn' t have taken it to the authorities .
he would have circulated it at parties .
success is fragile , mr. ledbetter .
do you know what it is to have a muse ?
i think i do .
joey was nothing like him .
but sometimes , if the light was just right ,
i could almost believe .
i guess i' il have to fiind another one .
look at you .
drunk as a skunk .
oh , but i put a nick in stuyvesant' s armor .
stuyvesant ?
haven' t you fiigured it out yet , baby ?
don' t you know what killed scotty gates ?
not stuyvesant , not stuyvesant' s no face slaves , just craziness .
that' s what makes all these victims .
none of your fancy demons , just plain ol ' , run of the mill craziness .
that' s the only beast you have to tame .
rom .
i liked what you played , up at the party .
little raw , little rusty , but it was good to hear .
you have a beautiful face .
in a strange turn of events , police were aided by a homeless man ,
romulus ledbetter , who resides in a rocky enclosure in inwood park .
ledbetter , known to locals as " the caveman , " was instrumental in the capture and arrest of joseph peasley , who is suspected of murdering scott gates .
gates' body was found in the same park on valentine' s day .
a police spokesperson stated that " the caveman " is a local hero .
daddy .
i wanted to warn you .
you know , you could come home for awhile .
i mean , if you wanted to .
i don' t think mama would mind .
you know , just just for awhile .
y you know , lulu , i don' t think so .
maybe some other time .
thanks just the same .
daddy , i want you to know ...
i am really [ sighs ]
i' m proud .
i' m proud of you .
