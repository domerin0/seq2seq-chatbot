royal tenenbaum bought the house on archer avenue in the winter of his 35th year .
over the next decade he and his wife had three children and then they separated .
are you getting divorced ?
at the moment , no ... but ... it doesn' t look good .
do you still love us ?
of course i do .
do you still love mom ?
yes , very much , but your mother' s asked me to leave and i must respect her position on the matter .
is it our fault ?
no .
no .
obviously , we made certain sacrifices as a result of having children , but , uh ... no , lord , no .
then why' d she ask you to leave ?
i don' t really know anymore .
maybe , uh , i wasn' t as true to her as i could' ve been .
well , she said ...
let' s just drop it shall we , uh , chassie ?
they were never legally divorced .
thank you , pagoda .
etheline tenenbaum keptthe house and raised the children and their education was her highest priority .
yes , i' il hold , please .
thank you .
i need $187 .
write yourself a check .
bene .
si .
grazie mille .
she wrote a book on the subject .
chas , chas !
richie !
uh , the gentleman in the blue cardigan , please .
thank you .
i have a two part question .
go ahead .
chas tenenbaum had , since elementary school taken most of his meals in his room standing up at his desk with a cup of coffee to save time .
in the sixth grade , he went into business breeding dalmatian mice which he sold to a pet shop in little tokyo .
he started buying real estate in his early teens and seemed to have an almost preternatural understanding of international finance .
he negotiated the purchase of his father' s summer house on eagle' s island .
hold it , chassie .
hold it right there .
what are you doing ?
you' re on my team .
there are no teams .
the bb was still lodged between two knuckles in chas' s left hand .
margot tenenbaum was adopted at age two .
her father had always noted this when introducing her .
this is my adopted daughter margot tenenbaum .
she was a playwright , and won a braverman grant of $50, 000 in the ninth grade .
she and her brother richie ran away from home one winter and camped out in the african wing of the public archives .
hi , eli .
you said i could run away , too .
no , i didn' t , and don' t tell anyone you saw us .
they shared a sleeping bag and survived on crackers and root beer .
fouryears later
margot disappeared alone for two weeks and came back with half a finger missing .
richie tenenbaum had been a champion tennis player since the third grade .
do you copy , anonymous ?
he turned pro at 17 and won the u. s. nationals three years in a row .
he kept a studio in the corner of the ballroom but had failed to develop as a painter .
up ... up ... right ... perfect .
pagoda ?
on weekends
royal took him on outings around the city .
put it out there .
these invitations were never extended to anyone else .
richie' s best friend , eli cash , lived with his aunt in the building across the street .
he was a regular fixture at family gatherings holidays , mornings before school , and most afternoons .
the three tenenbaum children performed margot' s first play on the night of her 1 1th birthday .
they had agreed to invite their father to the party .
what' d you think , dad ?
mmm ... didn' t seem believable to me .
why are you wearing pajamas ?
do you live here ?
he has permission to sleep over .
well , did you at least think the characters were well developed ?
what characters ?
this is a bunch of little kids , uh dressed up in animal costumes .
good night , everyone .
well , sweetie ... don' t be mad at me .
that' s just one man' s opinion .
chlldren : / happy birthday to you / / happy birthday to you ... /
he had not been invited to any of theirparties since .
in fact , virtually all memory of the brilliance of the young tenenbaums had been erased by two decades of betrayal , failure , and disaster .
go , mordecai .
/ na , na , na / / na na na na / / na na na na / / hey jude / / na , na , na / / na na na na ... /

i' ve been instructed to refuse any further charges on your room account and to direct you , in writing to please vacate the premises by the end of the month .
what about sing sang ?
i owe her $100 .
royal had lived in the lindbergh palace hotel for 22 years .
can you pay her in cash ?
uh uh .
he was a prominent litigator until the mid ' 80s when he was disbarred and briefly imprisoned .
no one in his family had spoken to him in three years .
read it back to me so far , pietro .
new paragraph .
richie had retired from professional tennis at 26 .
his last match had been widely discussed in the media .
your friend richie .
end of letter .
for the pastyear , he had been traveling alone on an ocean liner called the cote d' lvoire and had seen both poles , five oceans the amazon and the nile .
the crickets and the rust beetles scuttled
among the nettles of the sage thicket . " ' vamanos , amigos , ' he whispered
and threw the busted leather flint craw
over the loose weave of the saddle cock and they rode on in the friscalating dusk light .
eli was an assistant professor of english literature at brooks college .
the recent publication of his second novel ... ... had earned him a sudden , unexpected literary celebrity .
well , everyone knows custer died at little bighorn .
what this book presupposes is ... maybe he didn' t .
let me ask you something .
why would a review make the point of saying someone' s nota genius ?
you think i' m especially nota genius ?
i know w ...
you didn' t even have to think about it , did you ?
well , i just don' t use thatword lightly .
i have to go , eli .
margot ?
uh huh .
may i come in , please ?
how are you , my darling ?
margo was married to the writer and neurologist
raleigh st. clair .
i' m fine , thank you .
you need to eat something .
may i make you dinner ?
no , thank you .
she was known for her extreme secrecy .
for example , none of the tenenbaums knew she was a smoker , which she had been since the age of 12 .
nor were they aware of her first marriage and divorce to a recording artist in jamaica .
she kept a private studio in mockingbird heights under the name " helen scott .
she had not completed a play in seven years .
17 october , third examination of dudley heinsbergen .
all right , dudley make yours like mine .
raleigh' s next book was on the subject of a condition he called " heinsbergen syndrome .
where' s that red one going to go ?
done .

very good .
my goodness .
how interesting .
how bizarre .
dudley suffers from a rare disorder combining symptoms of amnesia , dyslexia and color blindness .
he has a highly acute sense of hearing .
there is also evidence of ...
i' m not color blind , am l ?
i' m afraid you are .
ari , fire alarm !
let' s go !
out you go !
let' s go !
uzi , emergency !
let' s go !
uzi ... what did i just say ? !

chas' s wife rachael was killed in a plane crash the previous summer .
what about buckley ?
it' s too late .
you forgot him .
buckley !
buckley !
no elevator !
there' s a fire .
go , go !
go , go , go , go , go !
go , go , go , go , go !
chas and theirtwo sons , ari and uzi were also on the flight and survived as did their dog who was discovered in his cage several thousand yards from the crash site .
four minutes , 48 seconds .
we' re all dead , burnt to a crisp .
over the last six months he had become increasingly concerned with their safety .
we left buckley .
it doesn' t matter .
etheline became an archaeologist and had overseen excavations for the department of housing and the transit authority .
apropos of my question regarding l 40 slash l 9 adjustments ... um ...
she taught a bridge class twice a week with herfriend and business manager , henry sherman .
it would probably be advantageous for your marital status to be legally established as single in light of the circumstances .
what do you mean ?
i mean for tax purposes .
but i thought ...
etheline ...
yes ?
will you marry me ?
i ...
i love you , uh ...
did you already know that ?
no , i didn' t .
since herseparation from her husband she had had many suitors ...
... but had not considered a single one until this moment .
this isn' t really a tax issue , is it ?
that' s true , uh ...
i don' t know why i put it that way .
let me think about it , henry .
hello .
please tell mr. royal this is the pagoda .
lobby .
thank you , dusty .
you' re welcome .
good morning , jerry .
hmm ...
oh , there' s a call for you , mr. tenenbaum .
who is it , frederick ?
a mr. pagoda .
what do you got ?
the black man asked her to be his wife .
no shit ?
what did ethel say ?
she think about it .
i don' t like the sound of this one damn bit , pagoda .
i mean ...
lord knows
i' ve had my share of infidelities but she' s still my wife .
and no damn two bit , chartered accountant is going to change that .
hi .
hey , pagoda , give us a hand , huh ?
chas ?
what' s going on ?
we got locked out of our apartment .
did you call a locksmith ?
uh huh .
well , i don' t understand .
did you pack your bags before you got locked out or how did you ... ?
it' s not safe over there .
excuse me for a moment .
what are you talking about ?
the apartment .
i have to get some new sprinklers and a backup security system installed .
but there are no sprinklers here , either .
well , we might have to do something about that , too .
okay .
lsn' t this fun , huh ?
lsn' t this great ?
feels like we' re camping .
when are we going home ?
huh ?
hey , look at this .
pretty cool , huh ? / who am i supposed to be ? /

good night .
good night .
good night . / look at me /

i think i' m going to sleep in here with you .
that way ... ... we can all be together .
/ oh , my love / / oh . /
what kind of side effects can be expected ?
well , there are a number of possibilities .
severe nausea and dizziness are standard .
a certain percentage of patients may also experience seizure .
you mean , like flopping around on the floor and everything ?
in some cases .
you have a visitor , my darling .
who is it ?
it' s me , sweetie .
raleigh says you' ve been spending six hours a day
locked in here , watching television and soaking in the tub .
i doubt that .
i don' t think that' s very healthy , do you ?
nor do i think it' s very intelligent to keep an electrical gadget on the edge of the bathtub .
i tie it to the radiator .
well , it can' t be very good for your eyes , anyway .
chas came home .
what do you mean ?
he and ari and uzi are going to stay with me for a little while .
why are they allowed to do that ?
i don' t know exactly but i think he' s been very depressed .
so am l .
so are you , what ?
but why is this necessary ?
' cause i' m in a rut , and i need a change .
hang on .

who do i see about that ?
the ship' s porter arranged for richie to disembark at halifax and transfer to a third class state room on board the queen helena destined for the eastern seaboard .
his trunks would not arrive for another 1 1 days .
hey , baumer .
do you mind if we get a picture with you ?
not at all .
he had made a request for his usual escort the one from his days on the circuit to meet him at the pier by way of the green line bus .
hi .
as always , she was late .
/ i' ve been out walking / / i don' t do too much talking these days / / these days / / these days i seem to think a lot / / about the things that i forgot to do ... / / and other times , i ... /
stand up straight .
let me get a look at you .
what' s so funny ?
well it' s nice to see you , too .
that night , etheline found all of her children
living together under the same roof for the first time in 17 years .
where' s your dad ?
the next morning , richie woke at dawn .
he had decided birds should not be kept in cages fed mordecai three sardines , and set him free .
i' ve missed the hell out of you , my darlings .
well , you know that , though , don' t you ?
i hear you' re dying .
so they tell me .
i' m sorry .
well , i' ve had a good run .
you don' t look so sick , dad .
thank you .
what have you got ?
i' ve got a pretty bad case of cancer .
how long you going to last ?
not long .
a month , a year ?
about six weeks .
let me get to the point .
the three of you and your mother are all i' ve got and i love you more than anything .
ho ho !
ho ho .
chas , let me finish here .
now , i' ve got six weeks to set things right with you and i aim to do it .
will you give me a chance ?
no .
you speak for everyone ?
i speak for myself .
well , you' ve made your views known .
let somebody else do some of the talking now .
what do you propose to do ?
i can' t say , really .
um , make up for lost time , i suppose .
first thing i want to do is take you out to see your grandmother , at some point .
i haven' t been out there since i was six .
i haven' t been out there at all .
i was never invited .
well , she wasn' t your real grandmother and i never knew how much interest you had , uh , sweetie .
anyway , you' re invited now .
thanks .
you know , rachael' s buried out there , too .
who ?
my wife .
oh , that' s right , isn' t it ?
well , we' il have to swing by her grave , too .
uh , i' il be right back .

now just remove the loose soil and note the decomposition levels .
i' m sorry to interrupt your work .
don' t be silly .
come on .
i just want to apologize for the other day when i proposed to you .
why ?
i thought it was very sweet .
i know i' m not as accomplished as some of the men you' ve been involved with .
uh , franklin benedict , general cartwright , and your ex husband .
oh , that' s ridiculous .
but , but , i feel ...
i can offer just as much as them .
i know i went about it backwards , but ...
henry , i have no interest in franklin benedict or doug cartwright i never did and as far as royal' s concerned , he' s the most ...
henry ?
henry , are you all right ?
yeah , i' m fine .
i' m fine .
anyway , let me know when you make up your mind .
henry , wait a second .
i' m sorry , i' m very nervous .

ari .
uzi , i' m your granddad .
hello .
i' m sorry we haven' t gotten to know each other .
i don' t get invited around very much .
what do you think of that , by the way ?
oh , you ... you don' t have to say anything .
it' s kind of a " fuck you " to the old man , i guess .
how' s your daddy ?
fine .
you think so , huh ?
how often has he got you working out ?
16 times a week .
do me a favor .
tell him you want to meet me .
but we just met .
no , we didn' t .
look , i' d like us to have a relationship but we have to pull some strings to make it happen .
now , here' s what you tell him .
you say ...
well , i bet mom would have wanted us to meet him before he died .
wouldn' t she ?
don' t you think ?
she was a tough old broad , wasn' t she ?
i wouldn' t know .
excuse me .
come on .
oh , that' s right .
we' ve got another body buried here , haven' t we ?
uh , hold on .

come on .
so what do you think of this big , old black buck moving in up there ?
who ?
henry sherman .
you know him ?
yeah .
is he worth a damn ?
i believe so .
what happened to your finger ?
uzi , shh .
it' s okay , i' il tell you .
i' m adopted .
did you know that ?
well , i am .
when i was 14 , i went to find my real family .
they live in lndiana .
all right , now , just set one of them hickory trunks right up top there , sister maggie .
did you try to sew it back on ?
wasn' t worth it .
hell of a damn grave .
wish it were mine .
it' s a shame , isn' t it ?
what ?
well , you probably had another good two or three years of competitive play in you .
probably .
i had a lot riding on that match , you know .
financially and personally .
why did you choke out there that day , baumer ?
mr. gandhi leads 40 15 .
that' s 72 unforced errors for richie tenenbaum .
he' s playing the worst tennis of his life .
what' s he feeling right now , tex hayward ?
i don' t know , jim .
there' s obviously something wrong with him .
he' s taken off his shoes and one of his socks and ... actually , i think he' s crying .
i think you' re right .
who' s he looking at in the friends ' box , tex ?
that' s his sister , margot and her new husband , raleigh st. clair .
they were just married yesterday , jim .
oh , yes .
i' ve never seen anything like this .
neither have l .
strange day out here at windswept fields .
i kind of disappeared after that , didn' t l ?
yeah .
but i understood .
i know you' re not very good with disappointment .
you still got that little bb in your hand , chassie ?
why did you shoot me ?
it was the object of the game , wasn' t it ?
no .
we were on the same team .
were we ?
well ... you sued me .
twice .
got me disbarred .
i don' t hold it against you , do l ?
and how is it possible for mr. tenenbaum to withdraw these funds without your written authorization ?
objection , your honor .
damn it , i ...
why don' t you leave the objections to me , royal ?
because i started the corporation when i was a minor .
so , my father was the primary signatory on most of my accounts .
he also stole bonds out of my safety deposit box when i was 14 .
you think you could start forgiving me ?
why should l ?
because you' re hurting me .
come on .
were you in prison ?
kind of .
minimum security .
i got jacked by the lrs .
should we split ?
yes , sir .
no , call me mr. tenenbaum .
okay .
no , i' m kidding ; call me pappy .
okay .
come on , let' s shag ass .
well , just let me know ifyou need somebody to talk to , okay ?
i like raleigh very much .
i know he' s a lot older than you are and you two are having some problems but ... anyway , maybe i can help .
okay .
thanks .
hey , baumer !
all right !
all right !
ha !
oh , shit !
oh , jesus .
by the way , i heard about that letter you sent to eli .
you dropped some cigarettes .
those aren' t mine .
they just fell out ofyour pocket .
oh , my lord , look at you .
come in .
did you tell margot about that letter i wrote to you ?
why ?
did she mention it ?
yes , i did .
why would she have repeated that , i wonder ?
well , i would ask you the same question .
rightly so .
what' d you say ?
hmm ?
what ?
i didn' t say anything .
when ?
right now ?
i' m sorry ; don' t listen to me .
i' m on mescaline .
i' ve been spaced out all day .
did you say you' re on mescaline ?
i did , indeed .
very much so .
how often do you , uh ... ?
i' m worried about you , richie .
why ?
well , actually , margot is , for some reason .
but i did find it odd when you said you were in love with her .
she' s married , you know .
yeah .
and she' s your sister .
adopted .
where are my encyclopedias ?
they' ve been placed in storage .
well , damn you .
you' re taking my encyclopedias .
th this is humiliating .
i' m sorry .
would you like to make a complaint in writing ?
where am i supposed to go ?
you' re turning me into a damn hobo .
i' d be happy to make a reservation for you
at another hotel .
you son of a bitch .
frederick .
hello there , dusty .
hello .
could you spot me a quarter ?
of course .
richie ?
hi .
it' s your dad .
i think he' s very lonely ...
lonelier than he lets on maybe lonelier than he even realizes .
have you spoken to him about this ?
briefly , and he agreed that we ...
i' m sorry , maybe i' m a little confused here .
what are you suggesting ?
that he come here and stay in my room .
are you out ofyour mind ?
no , i' m not .
anyway , i think that he' d be much more comfortable here than he would ...
who gives a shit ?
i do .
you poor sucker .
you poor , washed up papa' s boy .
all right , let' s not get out of hand .
please , don' t get in the middle of this , mr. sherman .
this is a family matter .
don' t talk to him like that .
call me henry .
i prefer mr. sherman .
call him henry .
why ?
i don' t know him that well .
you' ve known him for ten years .
as your accountant , mr. sherman , yes .
where are you going to sleep ?
i' m just going to camp out upstairs .
we brought our sleeping bag ...
uzi !
we don' t mind , dad .

ari , it' s not your decision .
nor is it yours .

i think he' s asleep because of the medication he' s on but i ...
i guess you can wake him up and throw him out ... if mom says it' s okay .

absolutely not .
for how long ?
we' il have to wait and see .
is he going to be all right ?
that depends .
is he a fighter ?
yeah .
then that' s the best we' ve got .
pagoda' s in possession of a parcel containing my will and some instructions for the funeral including my epitaph , for when the time comes .
proofread it for me before they carve it on the headstone , okay ?
okay .
i never did stop loving you , by the way .
do you believe that ?
not really .
you look terrific .
that dress is stunning .

stop saying that !
what' s that jackass doing ?
i know you , asshole !

mm hmm .
he always sends me his clippings .

i think he just likes the encouragement .
he' s done it for years .
he used to send me his grades in college .

chas has those boys cooped up
like a pair ofjackrabbits , etheline .

you got to brew some recklessness into them .
i think that' s terrible advice .
no , you don' t .
we take boxing and self defense classes .
i' m not talking about dance lessons .
i' m talking about putting a brick through the other guy' s windshield .

i did some malpractice work for him .
i do have high blood pressure , though .
look , i know i' m going to be the bad guy on this one .
but i just want to say , the last six days have been the best six days of probably my whole life .
immediately after making this statement
royal realized that it was true .
why' d you do this to us , royal ?
what was the point ?
i thought i could win you back .
and then i thought i could get rid of henry ... and at least keep the status quo .
but we hadn' t spoken n seven years .
i know .
plus , uh ...
i was broke .
and i got kicked out of my hotel .
you' re a bastard .
good bye , royal .
take it easy on those boys , chassie .
i don' t want this to happen to you .
you know , richie , this illness , this closeness to death has had a profound effect on me .

how many stitches did you get ?
i don' t know .
you want to see ?
/ they seem to stay for day after day / / and won' t disappear ... /
jesus . / i tried every way ... /
richie , that looks horrible .
i heard about your ex husband .

i guess so .
i didn' t get his name .
yeah .
i met him in the ocean .
i was swimming and he came out to me in a canoe .
we were only married nine days .
and i heard about eli .
i know .
poor eli .
anyway , they mostly just talked about you .
they did ?
yeah .
i guess that was the attraction , ifyou know what i mean . / she smiled sweetly / / she smiled sweetly / / and says don' t worry ... /
i have to tell you something .
what' s that ?
i love you .
i love you , too .
/ there' s no use tryin ' / / you' re here / / begin again / / and o' er again / / that' s what she said so softly ... /
i can' t stop thinking about you .

i doubt it .
/ shewould never say / / where she came from ... / / yesterday don' t matter / / if it' s gone /

it' s probably illegal .
i don' t think so .
we' re not related by blood .
that' s true .
still frowned upon .
but then , what isn' t these days , right ?
i don' t know , maybe it works .
why not , what the hell .
you love each other .
nobody knows what' s going to happen , so ...
you know something .
don' t listen to me .
i never understood her myself .
i never understood any of us .
i wish i could tell you what to do but i just can' t .
that' s okay .
no , it' s not .
you still consider me your father ?

royal had a heart attack at the age of 68 .
chas rode with him in the ambulance and was the only witness to his father' s death .
in his will , he stipulated that his funeral take place at dusk .
among the few possessions he left to his heirs was a set of encyclopedia britannica in storage at the lindbergh palace hotel under the names ari and uzi tenenbaum .
no one spoke at the funeral and father petersen' s leg had not yet mended ... but it was agreed among them that royal would have found the event to be most satisfactory .
