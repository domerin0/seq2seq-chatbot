i' m gonna find him before the police do .
i' m gonna find the man , and i' m gonna kill him .
did you say something , mr. markum ?
the notice .
katherine markum ... ... beloved daughter of james and marita , deceased ... ... stepdaughter of annabeth , sister to
sister to sara and nadine .
you guys again ?
yeah .
we' re like two bad pennies .
you dropping in on jimmy ?
yeah .
do you have some kind of , what , break in the case ?
no , just paying our respects .
where you off to ?
annabeth got a craving for cigarettes .
i' m gonna go get some .
see you in a minute .
by the way , mr. boyle , what happened to your hand there ?
garbage disposal .
it jammed , i stuck my hand in , it started again .
stupid .
painful .
garbage disposal .
bullshit .
yeah .
well , it doesn' t mean he killed anybody either .
come on .
heard you could use one .
thanks .
i quit 10 years ago , you believe this ?
whatever you need right now .
come on in , i' il get jimmy .
i got a couple errands i gotta run .
i' il be back in an hour .
you don' t have to come back , celeste .
i' il be fine .
sure ?
celeste boyle ?
yeah .
i' m sean devine , an old friend of dave' s .
this is whitey powers .
mrs. boyle .
nice to meet you .
look , i gotta go .
oh , damn it .
i left my report pad in the cruiser .
you better go get it .
yeah .
come on .
hey , celeste , could i ask you a quick question ?
me ?
what time did dave get home on saturday ?
what ?
it' s a little thing .
we' re running a time line on everything involving katie .
i' m sure ... ... dave told you he saw her at mcgill' s .
you think dave killed katie ?
oh , no .
god .
i didn' t say that .
why would i even think that ?
i don' t know .
no , no .
it' s just that we could figure out ... ... what time she was on the road if we knew what time dave got home .
see , it' s 5 minutes from your place to mcgill' s ... ... and katie left 15 minutes before dave did .
you see what i mean .
i was asleep .
saturday night , when dave came in , i was asleep .
okay .
well , thanks .
bullshit .
no , he was dating katie , jim .
they were gonna elope to vegas .
we found tickets under their names .
brendan harris confirmed it .
remember what you said ?
how she looked at you on saturday like she was preparing to never see you again ?
did brendan harris kill my daughter ?
no .
you' re 100 percent sure ?
passed his poly with flying colors , plus it seemed to me like he really loved her .
jimmy , i' m just curious , man .
why are you so dead set against that kid ?
he said katie told him you' d disowned her if she ever dated a harris .
i knew his father .
they called him " just ray " harris .
why is that ?
there were so many rays in the neighborhood .
you had " crazy ray " bucheck , " psycho ray " dorian .
the cool names were taken , so he got stuck with " just ray .
we never got along .
i flat out didn' t like him .
and he cut out on his wife when she was pregnant with that little mute of hers .
i don' t know .
i just figure the apple doesn' t fall far from the tree .
i didn' t want brendan or any other harris dating katie or any other daughter of mine .
i can' t believe we' re talking about just ray harris .
how about this ?
we' ve interviewed witnesses ... ... canvassed people who were in the bar .
we' ve run into more than a few of them who were questioned ... ... before us by one or more of the savage brothers .
so ?
so the savages are not policemen , jim .
some people don' t talk to policemen , sean .
with all due respect ... ... and just so we' re clear , this is our case .
how long ?
how long what ?
how long before you catch my daughter' s killer ?
you bargaining with us ?
bargaining ?
you giving us a deadline ?
we' il speak for katie , mr. markum .
if that' s okay with you .
just find my daughter' s killer , sergeant .
i' m not standing in your way .
the last thing we need is markum and the savages putting the fear of god ...
... into the neighborhood .
we grew up terrified of them .
eleven months apart , like their mother ran a loose cannon factory .
fucking knuckleheads .
ballistics are in on the markum murder .
yeah , you got a match ?
you' re gonna love it .
it' s a perfect match .
gun was a . 38 smith .
part of a lot stolen from a gun dealer in new hampshire in 1982 .
the same gun that killed katherine markum was used in a liquor store holdup in 1984 .
ln buckingham .
the flats ?
rome basin .
place called looney liquors .
i pulled the file .
it was a two man job .
they fired a warning shot into a wall .
that' s where the bullet got pulled .
nice work .
thought you' d like that .
it' s okay , ray .
don' t worry about it .
ma said that ?
that i' m better off ?
i loved her !
you know what that' s like ?
huh ?
i' m sorry .
no , you' re wrong .
i won' t ever feel that again .
right there .
went in through a bottle of jack and stuck in the wall right there .
scary , huh ?
scarier than a glass of milk , right ?
so take me through it .
these two guys come in ....
in rubber masks .
they came in through here .
that' s the storeroom .
there' s a door back there that leads to a loading dock .
i always keep that door locked .
so they must have had a key .
a key ?
so , what you' re saying is that it was an inside job ?
it had to be .
one of them , at least , worked for me at some point .
the only reason they fired that goddamn warning shot was they must have known ... ... i kept this under the counter .
and you told the police that at the time .
yeah .
sure , they went through my employment records .
questioned everybody who used to work for me .
never made an arrest .
still have a copy of those records ?
yeah , it' s in a box in the office there .
but i know who did it .
oh , yeah ?
this guy i fired a couple of weeks before .
son of a bitch came in here a few days after the robbery .
he had this fucking goddamn grin on his face .
and i just knew .
go tell a grin to a jury , right ?
you remember his name ?
do i look senile to you ?
no , sir .
name ... ... was ray harris .
we used to call him " just ray .
you say they used the same gun for another crime ?
that' s correct , sir .
thanks for your help , mr. looney .
where you been ?
out .
what you watching ?
some vampire movie .
guy just got his head torn off .
where' d you go , celeste ?
i was sitting in my car ... ... down by the channel .
you know ... ... thinking about things .
what' d you think about ?
oh , you know ....
no , actually , i don' t know .
things .
you know , the day .
about katie being dead .
and poor annabeth and jimmy , you know ... ... those things .
those things .
know what i was thinking about , huh ?
vampires .
what about them ?
they' re undead ... ... but i think maybe there' s something beautiful about it .
maybe one day you wake up and you forget what it' s like ... ... to be human .
maybe then it' s okay .
what the fuck you talking about , dave ?
vampires , sweetie .
werewolves .
you' re not making any sense .
you think i killed katie ?
celeste .
what ?
ls that the sense we' re making these days ?
where' d you come up with that ?
you' ve barely looked at me since you found out katie was dead .
in fact , you seem repulsed by me .
dave !
what ?
i don' t think anything .
i' m confused , okay ?
even your friend sean asked about
he' s not my friend , if you didn' t know .
he asked me about you .
what time you came home .
what' d you tell him ?
i said i was asleep .
that' s good thinking , baby .
jesus christ , dave !
why don' t you tell them about the mugger ?
the mugger ?
the mugger !
i see how your mind' s working .
i do .
i come home with blood on me the same night katie' s murdered .
i must have killed her , right ?
fuck !
henry ....
what ?
henry ?
henry and george .
i never told anyone that before .
those were their names .
isn' t that fucking hilarious ?
at least that' s what they called themselves , but ... ... they were wolves , and dave ... ... was the boy who escaped from wolves .
what are you talking about , dave ?
i' m talking henry and george .
they took me on a four day ride .
they buried me in this ratty old cellar with a sleeping bag .
and , man , celeste ... ... did they have their fun .
and no one came to help old dave then .
dave had to pretend to be somebody else .
you mean , all those years ago ... ... when you were a little boy ?
dave ....
dave' s dead .
i don' t know who came out of that cellar , but it sure as shit wasn' t dave !
you see , honey
fuck !
it' s like vampires .
once it' s in you ... ... it stays .
what stays ?
did you know there were child prostitutes in rome basin ?
what ?
fuck !
i can' t trust my mind anymore , celeste .
i' m warning you ... ... i can' t trust my mind .
i gotta go out , try to get my head around it .
okay .
okay .
okay .
the gun sends us in a different direction .
i don' t see it that way .
what does just ray' s gun have to do with dave ?
these things get passed around .
just ray may have blown town , but his gun never did .
i say we talk with brendan harris in the morning .
and i say dave boyle .
the hand story .
the wife , she' s definitely scared .
they' re hiding something , but dave boyle' s as much a killer as brendan harris .
boyle fits the profile , a fucking t.
mid 30s , white , marginally employed ... ... sexually abused as a kid .
on paper , this guy should be in jail already .
katie markum was not sexually abused , see ?
in that equation , sexual emission is part of the deal .
you were friends when you were kids .
this makes you a fucking liability .
he' s not my friend .
turns out you' re right , i' il have my cuffs off my hip faster than yours .
hey , jimmy .
you' re out late .
yeah , you too .
it' s cold , huh ?
yeah , i guess .
you know , i ....
i been sitting out here ... ... over the last few years ... ... waiting on katie to get back from someplace .
about midnight , i' d say to annabeth , " i' m gonna go sit on the porch for a while .
weird thing is ... ... it seemed to bring her back .
i saw her , you know .
saw who ?
katie .
i was at mcgill' s saturday night .
you saw katie saturday night ?
never got around to telling you .
did you talk to her ?
just nodded hello at one point .
next time i looked up , she was gone .
but ... ... jimmy ... ... she looked ... ... happy .
i got more walking to do .
good night .
you stole his car .
his car was officially towed .
from the front of his house .
no !
it was abandoned in rome basin ... ... adjacent to the parkway .
lucky for us , the parkway' s state jurisdiction .
some kids jacked the car ...
... they took it for a joy ride ....
what ?
why' d you do it ?
after i left you last night , i decided to talk to boyle myself , put some fear into him .
i get to his house , i decide to look in his car , see what he' s got .
i find blood .
blood ?
front seat of dave' s car .
b negative .
how much ?
a bit .
found more in the trunk .
a lot more .
type o , same type as katie markum .
wait , katie markum never got in anybody' s trunk .
she was chased through the park where she died .
it' s enough to ask questions .
your search is gonna get tossed out .
no , found and abandoned in state jurisdiction , for insurance purposes .
ln the best interest of the owner .
get a physical search , file the report .
bingo .
you wanna talk to him , or should i send him home ?
dave' s here ?
i' ve had him in the box for an hour .
sent two of my biggest , ugliest troopers to pick him up .
come on , mr. boyle !
we know you didn' t get that swollen hand sticking it in the garbage disposal .
oh , yeah ?
how do you know that ?
why' s your wife afraid of you ?
she know what really happened to your hand ?
how about a sprite or something ?
how about you tell us what really happened saturday night , mr. boyle ?
you lied .
that' s your opinion , which you' re entitled to .
hey , you think this is funny ?
no , i don' t .
i' m tired , i' m hung over .
not only was my car stolen last night , but now you won' t release it to me .
okay .
all right .
tell us , mr. boyle , how did you get the blood in your car ?
what blood ?
let' s start with the front seat .
what are you looking at him for ?
hey , you think i could get that sprite , sean ?
sure .
oh , i get it .
you' re the good cop .
how about a meatball sub while you' re at it ?
i ain' t your bitch , dave .
looks like you' il have to wait .
yeah , but you' re someone' s bitch , aren' t you , sean ?
the blood on your front seat , dave .
answer the sergeant .
we got a chainlink fence in our back yard .
me and my kid play wiffle ball every afternoon after school .
he' s getting good , so most of the balls are on the other side of the fence .
so i climb it .
except i slip ... ... slice myself where the links curl in , right here .
bled like hell .
ten minutes later , i gotta pick up michael at school .
probably was still bleeding when i got in the front seat .
what blood type are you ?
b negative .
yeah ?
that' s the match we got .
well , there you go .
not quite .
blood in the trunk of the car wasn' t b negative .
i don' t know anything about any blood in the trunk .
no idea how half a pint of blood got in the trunk ?
none .
this is not the way you wanna go , dave .
how will that look in court ?
you not knowing how someone else' s blood got in the trunk of your car ?
gonna look fine , i suppose .
you filed the report .
what report ?
the stolen car report .
the car wasn' t in my possession last night .
so whatever the thieves used it for , you should find out ... ... because it sounds like they were up to no good .
things looking any better on the sprite , sean ?
well , you just got too fucking smart .
the car is inadmissible .
anything there , his lawyers say was put by thieves .
i can break him .
he just kicked our asses !
you still think dave wouldn' t hurt a fly
ls that the point ?
no .
what is the point ?
we can break this open on the gun .
it' s the gun .
okay .
maybe .
so , what do we do with dave ?
fuck it .
kick him loose .
maybe a celtic cross .
that' s always a popular choice .
or this lovely red marble here .
or a figural .
that one .
very good .
nice and simple .
hey , jimmy !
annabeth said you were here .
we been asking around , like you said to .
yeah ?
yeah .
jimmy , this ain' t about the two year bit you did for me .
and it ain' t about me missing your brains running things .
katie was my niece .
not by birth , but she was part of our family , we loved her .
i don' t question you , val .
what' s up ?
cops are all over this .
doing their job for once .
bars , street trade , everything .
every hooker we talked to , bartender , already been questioned .
the fucking law has descended , jimmy .
what about just ray' s kid ?
quiet as a mouse .
kid' s no trouble to anyone .
i talked to diane and eve .
they said he loved her .
jimmy , they said that she loved him .
want us to take a run at him ?
no .
hold off for now .
anything else ?
what ?
val , you wanna spit something , spit it .
tell him .
sean devine and his partner went by and saw dave boyle .
dave was at mcgill' s .
probably questioning him like everybody else .
i heard something else this morning too .
two staties came by in uniform .
maybe they forgot to ask him something .
no .
when they left , they took him with them .
they put him in the back seat , if you know what i mean .

so did harris ever testify in open court ?
never went .
markum dummied up on the guys he was working with ... ... da was afraid he wouldn' t be able to convict .

i remember little things .
he smelled like schlitz and dentyne .
he ....

he carried a lot of change in his pocket .
it jingled when he walked .
you could always hear him coming home .
and if i guessed how much he had , even if i was close , he' d give it to me .

css reports , ballistics , fingerprint analysis , the 911 tape .
bunch of stuff .
all right , thanks .
we were talking about your father' s gun .
i told you , my father didn' t have a gun .
oh , well , i guess we were misinformed .
when was the last time you talked to him ?
never .
never ?
he went out for a drink and never came back .
but your mother never filed a missing person' s report .
why not ?
because he' s not missing .
he sends money every month .

five hundred bucks every month .
like clockwork .
from where ?
postmark says brooklyn .
how do you know it' s him ?
who else would it be ?
who else would send it ?
my ma says that' s the way he was .

why do you keep asking me if my father had a gun ?
you know why , kid .

hey , ray .
you guys come to make sure i didn' t fall in ?
come here a second .
sit down .
let me tell you about ray harris .
he was a buddy of mine .
he used to visit me in prison .
he checked in on marita and katie , my mother , if they needed anything .
he' s also the one who put me in .
he ratted me out .
that' s terrible .
my wife had cancer at the time .
i remember .
ray robbed me of being with her ... ... when she was dying .
the death part you do alone , but i could have helped her with the dying .
why are you telling me this ?
i knelt ray down over there and i shot him twice , in his throat and chest .
we were both crying when i did it .
jimmy
he was begging .
you know , pregnant wife , little brendan .
he said he knew me .
he said i was a good man .
what do you think , dave ?
you think i' m a good man ?
who do you hate ?
come on , who ?
no one .
what is it you think i did ?
as i was holding him under the water ... ... i could feel god watching me , shaking his head .
not angry ... ... but like if a puppy shit on a rug .
who do you love ?
you love me .
what about ma ?
you love me so much , i wanna hear you say it .
you think i killed katie , don' t you ?
don' t talk , dave .
don' t talk .
no , i killed someone , but i didn' t kill katie .
this is the mugger story .
he wasn' t a mugger , a child molester .
he was having sex with this kid in his car .
he was a fucking wolf !
he was a vampire !
get out of here .

they were playing with a gun , saw a car coming ... ... one of the kids lies down in the street , car swerves , clutch kicks out .
katie .
o' shea says they just meant to scare her and the gun went off .
but she hit him with her door , ran ... ... and they chased her so she wouldn' t tell anyone .
and the beating they gave her ?
ray jr . had a hockey stick .
all right .
go easy .
take a breath .

jimmy , what did you do ?
thanks for finding my daughter' s killers , sean .
if only you' d been a little faster .
are you gonna send celeste boyle 500 a month too ?
sometimes i think ....
i think all three of us got in that car .
and all of this is just a dream , you know ?
a dream , sure .
in reality ... ... we' re still 11 year old boys locked in a cellar ... ... imagining what our lives would have been if we' d escaped .
maybe you' re right .

nora , huh ?

nora .
i killed dave .
i killed him , and i threw him in the mystic .
but i killed the wrong man .
that' s what i' ve done .
and i can' t undo it .
jimmy .
i wanna feel your heart .
last night ... ... when i put the girls to bed , i told them how big your heart was .
i told them how much you loved katie ...
annabeth . ... because you created her .
and sometimes , your love for her was so big ...
... felt like your heart was gonna explode  please stop .
i told them their daddy loved them that much too .
that he had four hearts , and they were all filled up ... ... and aching with a love that meant we would never have to worry .
and that their daddy would do whatever he had to for those he loved .
and that is never wrong .
that can never be wrong , no matter what their daddy had to do .
and those girls fell asleep at peace .
you said , " last night . " you knew ?
celeste called , looking for you .
she was worried something might happen .
she told me about dave .
told me what she told you .
what kind of wife ... ... says that about her husband ?
and why' d she run to you ?
why didn' t you call ?
because it' s like i told the girls .
their daddy' s a king .
and a king knows what to do and does it .
even when it' s hard .
and their daddy will do whatever he has to for those he loves .
and that' s all that matters .
because everyone is weak , jimmy .
everyone but us .
we will never be weak .
and you ....
you could rule this town .
and after , jimmy ... ... iet' s take the girls down to the parade .
katie would have liked that .
