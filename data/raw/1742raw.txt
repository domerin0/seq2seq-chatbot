an impressive sight , general pershing .
that' s the kind of muscle we need to stop these damn raids .
i don' t have muscle ... but i have speed , that' s the reason for the train .
luck ... and a little information .
i' il find cordoba .
8 to 5 they don' t get that gun up in one try .
you' re on .
you lose , soldier .
you' re going to help them .
all of you .
on your feet .
move .
clay , i' ve got something here .
an insect , probably .
slide some whisky in that ear , you' il be alright .
i' m giving you a direct order .
my men aren' t under your orders .
they' re in the u. s. army and they' il obey orders .
they' il do what i tell them .
and i say they don' t drill ... they don' t work , they don' t salute .
they just fight .
jackson , adam .
six field pieces , general .
m 1902 , 3 inch , pivot traverse , panorama sighting .
enough fire power to blow a town apart .
six guns .
i want them .
i want to know where they will be ... how they are guarded , and by whom .
i want those guns .
alright , we' il split up here .
cordoba' s looking for recruits .
we' il ride in separate .
adam , keep your mouth shut .
your brother won' t be there to look after you .
i' il make you a bet .
i reach cordoba before you do .
don' t bet with me , boy .
you don' t know enough to tie your sweatband .
don' t get your foot caught in a bucket .
not unless it' s filled with beer .
get the hell out of here .
adios , amigo " .
he' s young , but he' il settle down .
how far ?
six feet ?
excellent , huh , svedborg ?
we can use them .
where did you find them , pistolero ?
a texas labour gang .
we figured we could join your revolution .
we brought you as many men as we could .
remember , hombres ... it' s better to die on your feet ... than live on your knees .
he' s softening , general .
i think he' s about to break .
you have a musical ear , svedborg .
a perfect pitch for human weakness ... but you enjoy it too much .
adam ...
my god , it' s your brother .
i am general cordoba .
listen to me .
we know about pershing' s train and the guns ... but , where is it going ?
they' il kill him .
that' s right .
what are we going to do , just stand and watch ?
that' s right .
you son of a bitch .
where is the train ?
where is the train ?
springs ...
harmon springs .
when will it arrive ?
tuesday night .
correct , general .
that is what our friend says .
the revolution has many friends , for a price .
kill him .
the revolution has many friends ... for a price .
general pershing .
fred tate , mayor of harmon springs .
tate .
please .
that' s a hell of a sight ... all those cannons .
but will they stop those damn greasers raiding us ?
no , mayor tate , i will .
do we get a detachment of cavalry ?
not likely .
then you' re selling a lot of bull .
look , this is an election year ...
fred .
you know i used to run 80 000 acres of range across the border ... before i got raided out ?
i want those bastards cured , right ?
right , and the way to do it is to get soldiers along the border .
the army doesn' t have enough men to watch 1200 miles of border .
that is why we need you .
don' t be polite , general .
i' il tell him .
the senator asked me to set this up , so this is the way it' il be .
you' il raise an auxiliary and patrol your own section of border .
any raid , you yell , and the army comes in and mops up .
and if they don' t come ?
don' t sell the army short .
you execute your part of the plan , we' il do the rest .
high .
your play .
watch the machine guns , forward , back .
i' il get to pershing .
slow him down .
we have some time .
why don' t we find some amusement ?
thanks , pal .
texas .
here .
thanks , sport .
not me , him .
i' m in no hurry .
i' il fix that , honey .
we' il have fun .
well , i smell a little ripe ...
you said it , honey .
i didn' t .
we can forget it .
i don' t want to make you throw up .
hey , honey .
i got paid .
i' m a professional .
don' t you worry , we' il be just fine .
don' t be too long .
ruby !
yes , sir .
what buffalo pit did he come out of ?
that' il cover it .
come on , big man .
wait a minute .
wait a minute .
wait , wait a minute .
stop making such a fuss .
it' il be just as good when you' re clean .
listen , we don' t do laundry here .
you get a bath after you' re stripped .
do you know anything about pistols ?
enough to know all you have to do is pull the trigger .
you washed there already .
i' il wash down here then .
better ?
don' t you think it' s time to rinse me off ?
i think so .
there you go .
what a specimen you are .
i think you' re clean now .
out you get .
thank you .
just a second .
one second .
just ... just ...
now , i' ve got to go out for a minute .
you get the rest when i come back , ok ?
honey , we were just getting started .
well ... maybe later .
douglas .
gently , captain , soft and gentle .
cordoba' s in town with a small army .
what ?
he came to get our cannon .
why didn' t you warn us earlier ?
they' re watching , the town' s full of them .
tell the general cordoba will set off an explosion as a distraction .
he' s going to hit from the rear .
with a mob of bandits ?
with trained light cavalry .
he' s counting on surprise .
you can chop him up like sausage .
be ready .
hey now , you' re touchy , captain .
and you' re off limits .
i just wander and play my music .
no law against that .
then wander in another direction .
yes , sir .
you play an excellent game of chess .
i don' t get the chance too often .
i have enjoyed it .
we aim to please .
are you a soldier ?
i like to think so .
now .
evening , ladies .
ready , honey ?
those things are too sharp .
i can' t stay .
where are you going ?
outside .
outside ?
what' s the matter ?
don' t you like me ?
yeah .
it' s just something that runs in my family .
you never can tell .
no questions .
no resistance .
get that ammunition out !
fire brigade !
get the machine guns set up in a crossfire pattern .
yes , sir .
keep it up !
jackson .
why don' t they use the machine guns ?
cordoba' s got them .
long live general cordoba !
let' s go .
where have you been ?
general , we lost the train .
let' s go .
viva cordoba !  viva !
32 men killed , 26 men wounded .
and six artillery pieces lost to those damn bandits ... plus a personal attack on myself and making jackasses out of the army .
your pride might be wounded , but i lost eight good men .
don' t be insolent .
your mission was to learn of cordoba' s plans ... we got no warning .
the fault is clearly yours .
yes , i made a major tactical error , i relied on captain riggs .
riggs was a fine officer .
he got himself decoyed and butchered .
that' il do , captain .
let' s get on with the tactical plans .
how accurate is this model of cordoba' s fortress ?
as accurate as the captain' s report .
we never saw the place , but harkness and i ... got descriptions from cordoba .
it' s here , in the mountains .
more than 200 miles in .
and that country' s worse than rough .
i ran cattle down there for 12 years .
the roads are dust for nine months and mud for three .
get caught in the attack , mr. warner ?
not too bad .
i just didn' t duck quick enough .
general , the last 40 miles are all open country .
then there' s not much chance of surprising cordoba .
no chance , i' d say .
it' s his country , he' s on a mountain top .
steep cliffs , one road .
with those cannons , he' s the hero of every peon in northern mexico .
ready !
fire !
fire !
fire !
i want those guns destroyed .
i estimate one month to arrange supplies , transport ... diplomatic agreement .
an expeditionary force .
you can' t go into mexico with the army .
why not ?
a gringo invasion ?
exactly .
they should be taught a lesson .
lessons , colonel , are taught in a classroom .
you are talking about killing people to prove a point .
those people will fight to prove a point .
i' m not interested in your opinions .
i' m interested in one thing : a solution .
yes , sir .
i want someone to get inside that fortress .
you mean me , sir ?
you , and the men you need .
you' il be travelling out of uniform ... without authorisation ... without orders .
lf you' re caught ... you' il be shot .
but i want those guns destroyed .
i want cordoba .
and i want him alive .
at ease , lieutenant .
captain douglas ... this is lieutenant gutierrez , liaison from the government of mexico .
lieutenant .
i' m assigning him to your unit .
what ?
my orders are to bring the traitor cordoba to mexico city for trial .
i' il try for the guns , i' il even try for cordoba ... but i' m not carrying him .
i was assured full co operation .
nada personal , teniente .
llevar slamente mis hombres .
i speak excellent english .
good , then you understand .
you don' t go .
that' s your decision .
thank you , sir .
don' t thank me , i' m not indulging you .
i' m gambling your life .
yes , sir .
the cannons , right ?
and cordoba .
you volunteered .
fine .
anyway you look at it , you' re a dead man .
pick your time .
i will .
look at that , busted clear off .
i' m completed the calculations .
the guard will change in three minutes .
meanwhile , this man is the only one on duty .
so what ?
i also determined this lock can be opened easily .
why don' t you just give it a try , greek ?
i have .
howdy , captain .
did you come with my pardon ?
released in my custody , corporal .
released ?
they just about killed me .
they didn' t .
where are we going ?
trouble .
next time i get you two in here ...
i' il strip you down and chain you to the bunks .
i' ve never stolen a bunk before .
200 miles into the sierra occidental ?
long , weary trip .
are you declining , andy ?
no .
i wouldn' t miss this dance for nothing .
i enjoy watching you go into the jaws of death ... and come out with somebody' s gold filling .
i' il get out .
i might just bring you out too .
with that guarantee , bring me along .
i will not go .
it' s a people' s revolution in mexico .
i won' t help to put it down .
we won' t attack the people .
we' re going after one man , cordoba .
you want to help the people ?
you know i do .
somebody' s got to get cordoba .
that' s what i' m going to do .
perhaps you' re right .
now , to get him , we' ve got to isolate him .
i don' t know , it sounds awful rough , cap .
maybe we ought to forget it .
you' re gutless , andy .
no , i just want to live forever .
i' il send the medal to your mother .
gentlemen , may i present our mexican ally .
teniente " antonio gutierrez .
he' s pretty .
he' s kind of noisy though .
that' s insolent .
you' re talking to an officer of the mexican army .
there' s no rank .
we' re all equals , except for me , being a little more equal .
throw him out .
you need somebody to isolate cordoba .
i can provide that somebody .
who ?
no , not unless i go along .
you' re bluffing .
i don' t trust you either .
the introductions will be inside mexico .
when ?
where ?
ln two days . ln madera , the casa de extraos .
we might stop by .
you' re a stubborn man , lieutenant .
why ?
once i was proud of my regiment .
it had honour .
now , it no longer exists because general hector cordoba ... betrayed it .
i will have payment for that betrayal ... even if i have to use you .
how far are we going to trust him ?
jackson .
andy .
peter .
i want that ready by 5am .
i' ve got some reconnaissance in town .
there' s a fellow i want to see .
very attractive , darling .
thank you so much , darling .
don' t knock my accent , rod .
it' s my only talent .
honey , that is a shameful lie .
i don' t know if i like that .
it makes me sound cheap .
i' m not .
when i choose a man , i' m faithful to him .
warner might not think that , when he finds out what you told me .
harry is sweet , and generous .
i' ve been absolutely faithful to him .
like i told you .
but i' m leaving this hole in the morning , so what the hell !
stop explaining .
you convinced me a long time ago .
there' s still a couple of hours until morning .
and a couple of things i' ve got to check out .
i thought you loved me .
i do .
for your beauty ... your fire , your talent ...
and your first class cigars .
pilot paid 30 pieces of silver .
ls cordoba giving you 80 000 acres ?
take my advice .
never trust a lady .
company still with us ?
no .
as soon as we left the main road they stopped tracking us .
four of them moved straight on .
they' re waiting for us .
that means we ride into them .
and make sure we' re the only ones that ride out the other side .
it' s a good thing we' ve got mr. warner with us .
he knows all about everything , don' t you , mr. warner ?
i think mr. warner wants to say something .
i' il have you court martialled for this .
lf i' m wrong , you can .
what do you want ?
just the pleasure of your company .
like i keep telling you , never trust a belly dancer .
what did you pay her ?
nothing .
maybe she loves me .
we' re about to find out .
peter , go round the back .
warner , your friends are expecting four of us .
you are number one .
there' s an ambush up ahead , right behind that monastery .
don' t shoot !
it' s me !
don' t shoot !
don' t shoot !
don' t shoot !
you get them all ?
yeah .
bad ?
no .
move your arm .
it' il do .
thanks for your concern .
anytime .
it should be cleaned first .
later .
jorge campo , a major in cordoba' s army .
alright , let' s go .
are you alright ?
how' s warner ?
he' s dead .
it' s been one bitch of a day .
i' m sore down to the bone .
how are you feeling ?
mean .
sorry .
jackson .
come cut this slug out of me .
why me ?
because you' ve got a steady hand .
it' s right here .
there ?
that' s right .
get on with it .
get on with it .
anything you say .
it' s not so deep .
a nice neat job .
any time .
oh , boy .
this is what i call taking it soft .
first class genuine oak wood jerky , first class water ... and a 10 minute rest every 20 hours .
that' s right , andy .
you get to ride drag , just as soon as you finish enjoying your dinner .
i surely do thank you .
a taste of water .
taste of dust from here on .
when i was a boy in greece , a man could live for a week on that ...
and another week on living rock .
why did you come here ?
i came for the third week .
madera is just past those hills .
about 3 hours , i' d say .
we' il make it in two .
even if it kills us ?
you say that with some feeling .
peter , set your watch at 1 . 15 .
mr. gutierrez , please ?
23 .
a light , amigo ?
who is it ?
i' m very cautious .
where' s your man ?
here .
miss leonora cristobal , captain rod douglas .
am i satisfactory ?
what' s she got to do with cordoba ?
he has a great weakness .
i know , for women .
leonora is a woman , and an attractive one .
you' re volunteering for a job a whore might turn down .
i have my reasons .
well ... this job works by my reasons .
you don' t fit into them .
you' re an idiot .
captain douglas , listen .
i want cordoba dead .
i' il do what' s necessary for that .
what' s necessary is to let him make love to you .
do what he wants .
and make believe you enjoyed it .
why do you want to do that ?
because ...
cordoba' s bandits raided our hacienda .
he killed my father and my brother ... as i watched .
are you satisfied ?
no .
women bury their dead and keep on living .
you' re dodging .
why ?
i know what it is to let him do what he wants with me .
he ... raped me ... and left me with my dead .
i want him killed .
we' re not going to kill him .
what ?
the government wants him tried publicly ... disgraced , not martyred .
but i swear to you , he will be executed .
we' re going to try to blow the cannon and bring him out with us .
you' d have to distract him .
do you know what that means ?
yes .
captain douglas , my family is dead .
i myself am also a little dead .
i want cordoba to pay for those deaths .
what' s the connection between you two ?
our families were friends .
alright .
i' il gamble a little .
try to keep cordoba entertained .
make a map of his personal quarters .
guards , doors , access .
go in early in the morning .
you' ve got that much time to reconsider .
my considering is done .
i' il be there tomorrow .
i' il arrive as an officer of cordoba' s own regiment ... anxious to join him for excitement and loot .
you' il be thoroughly convincing .
leonora , are you set ?
he didn' t exaggerate .
i' il survive .
your captain douglas is well suited to cordoba .
with luck ... they' il kill each other .
it' il be a hell of a climb up that mountain .
i' ve been looking at it , i' m not enjoying the sight .
you two will enjoy it more about half way up .
lf andy and i can get to the gate , we' il welcome you in .
what about that lady ?
it' s a gamble .
lf she can hook cordoba , fine .
lf not , we' il do it the hard way .
ln any case , we' il stick to plans .
climbing equipment ?
yes .
explosives ?
dynamite .
two fuses , slow and fast .
flares ?
it' il be a hot party .
right .
get rid of the horses , and bury the gear .
halt .
whoa .
where are you going ?
i wish to see general cordoba .
and who are you ?
lieutenant antonio gutierrez , a deserter .
so ?
so , i followed your example , but more discreetly .
i found myself trained , skilled , and bored .
ln mexico city they said you' il own half of northern mexico .
i am a greedy man .
a greedy man .
a touching story .
i joined forces with lieutenant gutierrez ... for my own reasons .
yes , i remember now .
from a hacienda outside madera , cristobal .
you remember ?
leonora cristobal .
seorita cristobal , how could i forget ?
i couldn' t forget either .
the way you took me ...
no man had ever touched me before .
so , you come back to me in friendship ?
yes .
and how shall i welcome you ?
with gratitude , i hope .
for what ?
for the love of a woman ?
for information .
this man is antonio gutierrez ... sent here by the mexican government to capture you .
with him , are four yankee soldiers commanded by captain douglas .
what have you done ?
i' il kill you !
excuse me , i forgot to introduce major svedborg .
he' s a first class cavalry officer .
and a sadist .
which is why he had to leave sweden to join me .
i overlook cruelty in exchange for ... efficiency ...
and loyalty .
well , well , well .
look who' s here ... dragging his tail back and only a week late .
i got cut off , i had to walk .
you mean you ran off .
then you heard we had the guns ... so you came back to join the revolution .
who is he ?
i don' t know .
i met him on the road .
another volunteer .
how do ?
texas .
where have you been ?
i got cut off during the raid .
i got wounded , had to walk back .
where ?
ln the shoulder .
that' s a fresh wound , texas .
keep him under guard until i get back .
him too .
take their guns .
keep them under guard .
stand over there .
we have heard there are yankee spies nearby .
they want to destroy the revolution , everything you' ve worked for .
we must find them .
five men will search the base of the mountain .
the rest , straight out .
we want them alive , if possible .
let' s go .
come on , move it !
go on , quickly !
leonora !
this won' t do you any good !
you betrayed douglas and his men !
but there' il be others !
lf she looks this way , we' re snake bit .
she seems to be occupied for the moment .
this captain douglas , what was his plan ?
i was to make love to you , distract you ... to give them time to destroy the guns and then take you .
i would think you' d hate me .
you ripped me apart and went away .
and i hated you .
but you took me .
and you still have me .
your story better hold up , or ...
we looked everywhere .
no trace of anyone .
provision a patrol .
search everything half a day' s ride out .
lf svedborg takes us to cordoba , that bitch will be right there .
when they stop looking at you , get lost .
i' ve got to see our friend antonio .
ln the cooler ?
i' il try .
get me out later tonight , 9 . 30 .
i' il get you out .
how the hell will you get in ?
the hard way .
sergeant ortega .
ortega !
it' s over , boys .
you afraid ?
no .
i' ve got other things on my mind .
why ?
i don' t know .
i think it' s the night .
it reminds me of the darkness of a grave .
antonio ?
where are you ?
over here .
you' re easy to find .
leonora betrayed me .
how much did she tell ?
everything .
come on , give me a hand .
two things you should never do with a woman ... argue with them , and trust them .
get a piece of paper and make me a map of cordoba' s rooms .
cordoba uses the old chapel as his office .
his private quarters are next to the cloister in the old dining hall .
rear entrance ?
no .
it backs on the cliff .
the only way in is through the chapel .
that means over the roof .
ls that the entrance ?
yes .
charming , isn' t it ?
peasant work .
crude , but reverent .
this was the father superior' s room .
i took it for my own .
how pious of you .
the peasants are superstitious .
i use their superstition .
i use whatever comes ... to hand .
what' s up ?
nothing .
hey ...
i' ve orders to bring the prisoner to the general .
let' s go .
howdy , captain .
what time is it ?
nine thirty .
do as he says .
i' il see you at the stables .
buenas noches " , lieutenant .
i brought you a uniform .
undress him .
come on .
have you authorised the removal of the officer from the guardhouse ?
no .
one of the guards and a sergeant went to take him to the general .
curious .
i' il speak to the general .
colonel , the general requested privacy for tonight .
check the guardhouse .
wait there .
where is the general ?
who is it ?
your tea , general .
go away .
your tea , general .
it' s ready .
it' s ready , general .
general ?
back off .
general , may i introduce captain douglas , the man i told you about .
i know you talked , but you got him alone .
that' s all i wanted .
bitch .
it' s a shame .
what ?
these guns have beautiful mechanisms .
you' ve got a mechanic' s soul .
i like machines , they can be trusted .
not like people .
some people can be trusted .
yeah , some .
know what this is ?
a flare gun .
right .
burst of smoke , burst of fire .
we' il put a shell into everything that' il burn .
ammo here , explosives here ... stored hay .
got it ?
yeah .
sure ?
i' m a trained officer .
so far , all i' ve seen you do is fall over your own feet .
your insolence ...
now , look here .
lf you want to play soldier with me , prove you can hold up your end .
i' il prove anything you like .
attaboy .
let' s get moving .
4 minutes .
she' s set .
go ahead .
that' s it , get the door open .
ain' t that pretty ?
that' s it .
keep moving .
meet at the stables in 10 minutes .
guard the guns !
what is she doing here ?
i missed her .
come on .
all present and accounted for .
ls she coming along ?
lf you don' t mind .
i never minded a pretty woman in my whole entire life .
when are we going ?
the boys will tell us .
where' s pete ?
he didn' t make it .
bring cordoba and the girl .
ready .
andy .
you bastard .
andy !
we' il rest the horses here .
i told you once , my place , my time .
now .
he was my brother .
and you let him die .
i' m sorry your brother got killed .
well ...
jack , i' ve known you a long time .
lf it' il make you feel better , pull the trigger ... but don' t look from any help from me .
you bastard !
jackson .
he was shot from behind by one of his own men .
he' s been dead since we left the fortress .
the general' s not going to like that .
why not ?
you destroyed the guns , cordoba is dead ...
you' il be a hero .
the trouble with being a hero is the morning after .
let' s bury him .
