always considering the best interest ... . . . and well being of the child .
therefore , you may make visitation . . . . . . every other week and christmas eve . . . . . . and on easter sunday , wearing your pretty easter outfits .
your honor , my ex husband is addicted to pills and he' s a thief !
because of his record , i lost my job as a secretary for the fbl .
he was the finest high school tailback i ever saw .
of course he' s had his run ins with the law , but he' s . . . . . . made his accommodations with the authorities .
being an informer for the vice squad . . . . . . hardly qualifies him to raise a seven year old !
neither does being a mother without a job !
but i lost it because of him !
little lady . . . . . . my decision is final .
next case .
the big man' s here !
when does she go on ?
pretty soon , jerry .
welcome to eager beaver , gentlemen .
thank you .
keep it close .
keep it very close .
you got it .
last stop , okay ?
what do you say , congressman ?
poontang .

we got a rehearsal tomorrow .
melissa thinks i' m in temple .

we' ve got the legendary twin temples from fort lauderdale .
miss urbana sprawl wrapping up on the great stage .
nice spot , isn' t it , erb ?
it' s very uplifting , sir .
jerry , the usual evian with lime ?
please . >from paris , france . . . . . . put it together for the fabulous monique , jr . !
oh , my god .
i love you !
that song is killing me !
those babies gonna wind up in traction , you don' t play some ballads .
god , it' s freezing !
they could store meat in here .
in fact , they do store meat in here .
no , i' ve been trying all day !
are you positive ?
no , thank you .
can' t reach her ?
darrell' s phone' s out of order .
i just know he' s moved with her again to some new dump .
god , what a nightmare !
he drives around with her in that van .
drinking , taking pills . . . .
he doesn' t even think about putting a seat belt on her .
he' s a dirtbag !
you hang in there , honey .
you' il get angela back .
that judge will see the light .
it' s expensive light , i' il tell you that .
it' s gonna cost me $1 5, 000 for this appeal .
is there even a chance i can make that in six weeks ?
you' il have to dance day and night and hope some arab sheik shows up .
i love you , girls , i do .
but i can' t work here when i go back to court .
your honor , i found a new job .
i' m working at the eager beaver .
it' s honest work .
you have nothing to be ashamed of .
i know that and you know that .
but the judge won' t .
not him .
god , i still get nauseous before i have to go out there .
you' il get over it .
really ?
i can' t imagine that .
you guys having a good time ?
here' s the lucky guy !
you' ve come to the right place .
monique !
look at these hunks !
we' re having a party !
keep an eye on them bachelors .
they look like real trouble .
it' s time to strap yourselves in because you are going for a ride !
in her eighth week here . . . . . . put your hands together and make her feel good .
for the one , the only erin grant !
how about that !
larry king' s at table six .
what' s he wearing ?
tank top and gold chains that' s larry , all right .
how do i look ?
better than me .
that ain' t easy .
you talk to her ?
darrell' s phone' s out of order .
i think he moved again .
i' d embrace the opportunity to maim his white ass up .
that' s really thoughtful , but i don' t think it' d help me in court .
erin , come on .
i can' t have an empty stage .
man , let the chumps wait !
going to the head .
you' il behave ?
an angel appeared .
an angel of pure delight .
go , paul !
i' m getting married this weekend to melissa .
you love her ?
very much .
then go home to her .
shad !
shad !
listen up !
the flesh farm is killing us and you know why ?
they have free buffalo wings .
their girls are hookers .
no , because their girls dance fast .
and fast means sweat .
and sweat . . . . . . means drinking !
oh , my god !
what was that ?
i got this .

how about a wine cooler , erin ?
i got mango , passion fruit
water would be just fine , alberto .

shut up !
she' s all caught up with them cubs .
some of the guys down at the nuclear plant . . . . . . they were asking me if you' d do , like . . . . . . private parties .
i don' t think so .
oh , that' s a shame .
because i' il bet that you are a great dancer .
alberto , i' il go crazy if i don' t get darrell' s new number .
i promised angie i would call her every day and
i hear he moved , darrell .
alberto , where is he ?
you have to ask rita about that .
he calls here about twice a week .

got no respect for me even though i am . . . . . . a professional man .
you' re looking real good .

oh , yeah ?
you want some advil ?
that would be so great .
well now , you sit right here .
i' m gonna fix up that mean old headache .

i' ve gotta run , but thanks anyhow .
deerfield beach ?

so this is the new brainstorm ?
the wall street journal says this is the hottest selling yogurt .
i' il bring this in . . . . . . say my hair fell off from the shock .

lawyer thinks it' s a genius idea .
your lawyer has an office over a video store .

i don' t wanna be a bouncer forever .
erin !

he is totally harmless .
come on !
also , could you add kenny g to your routine ?

only talking , no touching .
ladies !

major announcement .
major asshole .
i heard that .
on monday , i' m installing a ring .
mud wrestling ?
this is something that' s really happening .
it' s contemporary .
it' s now .
and it' s creamed corn wrestling .
corn ?
corn wrestling ?
that' s disgusting !
i' m not putting these in corn .
no way !
what ?
no , it' s terrific !
in lsrael , we did falafel wrestling .
all the girls broke out in hives everywhere .
and i mean , everywhere !
well , falafel , sure .
this is corn !
what is this , a mutiny ?
i don' t think so .
no chance that i' m gonna roll around naked in creamed corn . . . . . . with drunken yahoos trying to stick niblets up my hoo hah .
not naked .
topless .
health department won' t go for naked .
not with food products .
i always liked the health department .
so you' il think about it ?
not for one second .
erin !
please !
you' re getting a big following here .
even with that shit music , the guys love you .
you go into the corn , you set a great example to the other girls .
i got it !
how about pasta wrestling ?
now , that' s classy .
linguine , rigatoni ?
just nothing with meat or fish .
orly , if i wanted to wrestle . . . . . . i would' ve joined the world wrestling federation .
and speaking of real class ?
what' s the problem ?
we hate these .
they degrade women and beavers .
i' il take it under advisement .
but just the coasters and the napkins .
not the sign .
that' s a landmark !
good night , darlin ' .
for you , miss grant .
they' re beautiful , jerry .
thank you .
you can call me erin
i can' t .
i worship you too much .
believe me . . . . . . i' m no one to be worshiped .
i' m just trying to make a living .
i worship your essence .
if you were a nurse or a teacher , i' d feel the same .
you receive my note ?
i did and , you know , i was wondering what you had in mind .
i believe i can help you get your daughter back .
i believe i can get to judge fingerhut .
how ?
through . . . . . . a certain congressman who i' m certain will listen to me . . . . . . because i know some things .
things ?
really ?
well , you know what , jerry ?
you' re really a terrific guy . . . . . . and so supportive of me ever since i started here .
maybe you shouldn' t
just give me a week .
good night , my precious .
melissa thinks i was in synagogue the night this happened .
what do i tell her ?
you left synagogue and a gang of skinheads jumped you .
in the meantime , we' il develop these , we' il see what we have .
i see mucho damages .
these strip joints are insured up the ass .
my neck really feels better , uncle al .
oh , yeah ?
how' s it feel now ?
call little caesar' s .
order me a health pizza .
get some for yourself .
no , thank you , sir .
i' m dieting .
i' il just grab a yogurt out of the fridge .
this is a major disaster !
major .
unbelievable .
without doubt . . . . . . the most asinine piece of human behavior .
it' s never gonna happen again , malcolm .
i' ve got it under control .
you see . . . . . . i just love naked women .
it' s a character flaw .
god' s testing me
oh , will you shut up !
you idiot .
you can' t talk to me like that .
i' m a u. s. congressman .
i can' t ?
you go psycho in a titty bar six weeks before the election .
what should i call you ?
winston fucking churchill ?
it was all i could do to keep . . . . . . willie rojo from strangling you with his bare hands .
everybody has a bad night .
if you' re under pressure like we are , under the public eye
who recognized me ?
his name . . . . . . is jerry killian .
and he' s waiting outside .
now ?
now .
we gotta move on this before we get eaten alive .
move on what ?
if this is a shakedown , get willie to pay them like always .
why drag me into it  because it' s not about money .
it' s not ?
no .
he wants you to persuade judge fingerhut . . . . . . to reverse a child custody case for some stripper .
who he' s porking ?
it' s disgraceful to have a man like me deal with
he' s not porking her .
well , then , why does he care ?
because he' s nuts !
that' s why he' s dangerous .
if he was porking her , at least i could deal with him man to man . . . . . . but this is fruitcake love .
i mean , fingerhut' s a democrat .
he won' t listen to me .
you can' t say that to this little creep , davey .
you gotta string him along .
bullshit him .
use the old . . . . . . dilbeck charm .
what if he doesn' t go for it ?
then we have a serious problem .
mr. killian !
come in and meet congressman dilbeck .
i' il bet that' s jerry killian .
lucy !
come here .
come on .
how perfect is this ?
you know , i was just thinking . . . . . . is this really on the same planet as miami ?
i can read .
where' s andy ?
he' s been fishing since eight .
dad !
dad !
there' s a floater !
he' s still got his glasses on .
go tell mom to call the police .
you' re the police .
i' m the miami police .
we just need the local law here .
go on .
man !
of all the lakes . . . . . . in all the counties . . . . . . in all the world . . .
. . . you gotta float up in mine .
you son of a bitch .
mama !
hey , come here !
i' ve been trying to reach you , baby .
heard you stole my sister' s mail !
that' s a federal offense .
wait for mommy .
i' m gonna go talk to daddy .
why do you keep moving ?
how will she make any friends ?
aren' t we the child psych
it has nothing to do with child psychology , you moron !
where' s she going to school ?
opa locka ?
deerfield beach ?
have you even thought about it ?
yeah , i thought about it plenty .
hey , you only got two hours !
that' s what the judge ruled right there from that bench !
i' il be right behind you just in case you' re thinking about snatching her !
mommy , does " snatch " mean " kidnap " ?
how did you get so smart ?
is free willy back yet ?
still out .
people are pigs .
sit on movies like they own them .
freak .
it' s shad .
open up .
it wasn' t me .
it was a temp .
where' s perry mason ?
our good friend , mr. shad !
come on in , we have lots to discuss .
no shit .
if i buzz twice , you say my mother' s on the line .
she has chest pains .
what do you mean he' s a wheelchair salesman ?
there' s one nice thing about hospitals .
a lot of kids in chairs are really sick , and i wave at them . . . . . . and they smile just like on jerry lewis .
and do you do this every day ?
on fridays i stay with aunt rita .
that' s a wholesome environment .
she has real wolves .
i don' t want you touching those animals .
they' re not like dogs .
time .
time .
i love you more than anything in the world .
you know that in your heart .
mommy ?
what , baby ?
do you know those dolls you got me ?
daddy says he can' t find them anywhere .
we' il get you new ones .
i love you .
bye , baby .
i love you .
hey , let' s go !
all right , you go on .
i' il bring your stuff .
hey , baby !
did you have a good day ?
good .
she told me about your new profession .
really admirable .
at least i ain' t naked .
at least i ain' t naked " ?
you get caught using that child in a felony . . . . . . and family services will put her  no way i' d get caught .
got me one of them doctor' s jackets and a stethoscope .
look like one of them dudes on er .
darrell , would you think for once in your life ?
i don' t need no stripper telling me how to behave .
i' il see you in two weeks .
you ready ?
you know where that was taken ?
your mama' s birthday party .
the eager beaver .
can you identify those people ?
yeah , this old fool .
erin .
erin' s the stripper ?
what' d you say ?
erin' s the stripper .
dancer , fat ass .
she' s a dancer !
the young man who was so savagely beaten . . . . . . is my client , paul guber .
no shit .
too bad for him .
i don' t think so .
the third person in that photo is none other than . . . . . . david l. dilbeck .
so what ?
do you follow politics , mr. shad ?
do i look like i follow politics ?
david dilbeck is the u. s. congressman . . . . . . from the fifth district .
he' s up for reelection soon .
you gonna put the squeeze on him .
nice .
what that gotta do with me ?
i' il give you 10 % of the squeeze .
is this conceivably as big as the yogurt deal ?
as big " ?
congressman dilbeck is chairman of the subcommittee on sugar , okay ?
the rojo family cannot allow him to lose .
because their price supports are worth hundreds of millions of dollars .
and quite frankly , mr. shad . . .
. . . this is the opportunity of a lifetime .
good .
just keep erin out of it .
i' il do my best .
she' s out .
erin is out .
erin who ?
charming spot .
look .
steven spielberg' s house .
i wish he' d come in here .
i' m sure he would have big hots for me .
you' d turn his whole life around .
steven spielberg' s shower .
can you imagine me and him in that shower ?
oh , that cute little beard !
yours or his ?
hey , jerry , it' s erin grant .
what a long beep .
someone' s waiting for you .
maybe you' re out of town . . . .
i' m just calling to see about that legal matter we discussed .
if you get a chance , just give me a call at the club .
thanks , bye .
michael jordan' s at table eight !
great .
say hello to the fantastic monique , jr . !
lieutenant garcia with homicide .
what' s he want with erin ?
got no idea .
all i need is scandal .
what do you know about prozac ?
it makes you happy .
there' s side effects .
like what ?
limp noodle .
who cares ?
i haven' t had a hard on since i started running this place .
closest i got was sea world .
porpoise got me hot .
what the fuck you telling me that for ?
i' m going next door .
see what ling' s up to .
drowned ?
oh , my god .
he had pictures of you all over his apartment .
he was a really big fan .
he used to bring me flowers
he was just a fan ?
there was no touching ?
this has been a real pleasure .
i dance so i must turn tricks .
nice way to open a conversation .
i understand you' re a hooker ?
you don' t work in a library here .
i' m trying to figure out the man' s life .
he was a customer .
that' s all i know about his life .
except that it' s over .
i apologize .
sincerely .
look , i' m real i' m nowhere on this .
i could use some please give me a minute ?
please ?
so where did this happen ?
lake okeechobee .
it' s where i made the serious mistake of taking my vacation .
your family ?
nice .
it' s not the kind of place you' d expect to encounter a homicide .
homicide ?
you said he drowned .
no , we did an autopsy .
the water in his lungs , they come up clean .
there was tap water in his lungs ?
exactly .
somebody killed him , like in a bathtub , then dumped the body in a lake .
do you read mysteries ?
up till three months ago , i worked at the fbi in miami .
a secretary .
until i got fired for having a defective husband .
i' m in a pretty bad custody fight .
jerry was trying to help me . >from the shores of the dead sea . . . . . . a decorated nurse in the lsraeli army . . . . . . say shalom to the fabulous ariel sharon !
could we go outside ?
i could really use some air .
oh , mr. orly !
what a wonderful surprise .
nice to be in quality club , eh ?
yeah , if you like freak shows .
ling !
ling !
get over here !
move it !
excuse me .
i' m sorry .
but that' s mr. chris rojo . . . . . . of the sugar rojos .
typical of the kind of rich big shots we get here .
is this the place where i met my angel ?
i don' t know which angel you' re referring to .
a congressman ?
you mean a u. s. congressman ?
well , he wasn' t specific who it was .
i told him it was bananas . . . . . . and maybe it was better that he stayed out of it .
on wednesday , there was an incident , a guy with a bottle
oh , he was a total whack job .
drunk out of his mind .
can you remember , was mr. killian here ?
no , not offhand , but maybe .
think about that and let me know .
here' s all my numbers .
once again , i apologize .
i mean , for any aspersions .
you wanna make it up to me ?
i beg your pardon ?
i need a favor .
you' ve got friends on the vice squad ?
they' re not my bosom buddies .
my ex husband' s an informant .
it' s why this idiot judge gave him custody .
are you joking ?
i wish .
but i was thinking , if vice dumped him as an informer . . . . . . when my appeal came up in six weeks . . . . . . i could then say my ex husband is unfit .
he' s such a criminal  wait a minute .
he' s a criminal ?
your ex ?
he' s a criminal ?
he steals wheelchairs .
thank you very much .
all right , let me see what i can do .
good night .
you know , not having her around . . . . . . it' s like my heart is missing .
i' m sure .
let me see what i can do .
good night .
good night .
how much you pay them ?
i think they' re up to $30 a day .
subtract room and board , booze and smokes .
you know , who knows ?
maybe they pay us !
hell of a business .
it' s the best !
we gotta protect it , my friend , right ?
son , i' ve been protecting your family for 20 years .
you' re the greatest , man !
i' m saying , until the election , no more girls , huh ?
bring your wife down here for a weekend .
what' s her name ?
alice ?
mary pat .
mary pat .
chris , i met an angel .
i mean , she' s a dancer .
she' s so pure and clean .
not like the rest of these whores .
if i could be with her  what ?
you' d be a good boy ?
i' d be perfect .
i' d be perfect .
i swear i would !
i would stop going to clubs .
i would stop drinking .
i would just lead a regular life , you know ?
with my wife and a steady mistress .
and i would have a decent life .
so let' s do it !
where' d you see her ?
my brain has just turned to shit .
that' s why you' re in congress !
you' re probably right .
who is it ?
it' s lieutenant garcia .
is it a bad time now ?
no , just a second .
i was rehearsing .
morning .
i was nearby .
i probably should' ve call
no , no , it' s fine .
please come on in .
thank you .
can i get you some coffee or english muffin ?
no , no , thanks .
you know , i was thinking . . . . . . and if i had to guess , i would say . . . . . . that jerry was probably there because he was there most nights .
so do you know anything new ?
actually , i have some good news . . . . . . and i have some mediocre news .
the good news is darrell lost his informant status .
9 : 00 this morning .
vice thought his information was bogus anyway .
this is great !
now in six weeks , i can go to the judge
that' s the mediocre part .
judge fingerhut had a heart attack early this morning . . . . . . at a porno theater on ocean .
don' t tell me that !
he was doa . . . . . . at don shula hospital .
anyway , i called around , and the earliest . . . .
it' il be six months before your appeal' s heard .
the system is all backed up .
i can' t allow her to stay with him for another six months !
there' s nothing you can do from a legal standpoint .
absolutely nothing .
i understand .
is today friday ?
yeah , it' s friday .
i gotta run now .
how are you ?
all right .
you' re wonderful , mr. dilbeck !
shalom , darlin ' .
shalom to you .
manischewitz !
congressman .
alan mordecai .
alan , how you been ?
fine , sir .
congressman , i brought a little souvenir for you .
obviously , the ramifications of that , if it were to become public
is this me ?
yes , i' m afraid so .
if this became public , it would be devastating . . . . . . and i' d like to avoid that .
it' s her .
it' s my angel .
heel !
slow down !
heel , will you ?
are you going to your house , mama ?
no , we' re going to our house .
for the whole day ?
even better .
really ?
really .
you snatched me , didn' t you ?
i guess i did .
you sure did .
come on , pumpkin .
zippity doo dah .
i didn' t know she had a child .
of course you
she' s divorced , but the husband has custody .
remember ?
she' s carrying numerous bags .
that doesn' t look like just a visitation , does it , erb ?
i' il look into it .
check custody status of ms. erin grant .
god , give me strength .
what an extraordinary creature .
how perfect in every detail .
davey , you promised you' d behave until after the election .
you don' t understand .
this is love .
please .
i won' t campaign . . . . . . until i can possess . . . . . . her actual velvet self .
in the meantime , i want you to bring me something .
something of hers .
something . . . . . . personal to tide me over .
how personal ?
intensely personal .
am i a good help ?
honey , you are the best laundry assistant i' ve ever had .
all right , let' s hit the road , jack .
who' s jack ?
it' s just an expression .
come on .
this is some picture .
it' s fatal .
i don' t accede to blackmail .
willie , i agree with you in principle . . . . . . but this gets out , we' re in a bigtime shitstorm .
pop , pay the guy off .
you got a cancer , you talk nice to it ?
no .
you cut it out .
willie .
we can' t operate like we' re in the funeral business .
i' d rather buy cops than pay blackmail .
understood ?
i just think we should consider other options .
understood ?
what else ?
a connected matter .
davey wants this stripper , and i' d like to use the boat .
that way , we can control the situation .
she' s the girl from the picture ?
that' s correct .
what does she know ?
well , we gotta find out .
the good news is she got custody illegally , so she' s vulnerable .
vulnerable isn' t good enough .
i say let davey have his fun .
then lose her .
willie , willie .
first , let' s determine whether she can hurt us or not .
i' m sure she' s just another dumb whore .
for her sake , i hope so .
phooey !
i go back three .
this is complicated .
it' s easy .
all right , is it your turn ?
you stay here with us , sweetie .
mama' s orders .
everybody , listen up .
this is lorelei !
formerly of the flesh farm .
she and her snake , monty python , have signed an exclusive . . . . . . contract with us .
you' ve got a snake ?

and what was that ?
i talked to judge fingerhut about your daughter .

and how did you know about my case ?
little birdie told me .
it must have been a little old birdie who knew me very well .
who " is not important .
come on now .
not just a little hint .
i can' t do that .
but i know the new judge .
he' s a very good friend of mine .

i wish to give you some advice . . . . . . about your adorable little daughter , angela .
what about her ?
your custody of her is illegal .
that' s just temporary until the appeal gets heard
please , please , miss grant .
really , it' s of no concern to us .
as long as you refuse to cooperate with certain individuals . . . . . . who seek to harm and slur congressman dilbeck . . . . . . for their own selfish political gain .
i don' t know what you' re talking about .
excuse me .
perhaps you don' t .
but what a pity if angela were to be placed in a state home .
pretty grim , most of them .
a lot of strange people working there .
i' d recommend that you cooperate with us for the child' s sake .
which means you talk to no one about tonight . . .
. . . or any night .
understood ?
of course .
good .
now if you' il excuse me . . . . . . i' d better toss the congressman into a cold shower .
by the way , i can see why he' s so taken by your charms .
good night .
watch your step on the gangplank .
she ain' t dumb enough .
