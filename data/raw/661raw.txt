no , thanks .
i don' t look any more .
we' ve seen a lot of ...
oh , dear god !
you know you shouldn' t be looking at the files .
it' s not against the rules .
but it' s not encouraged .
come on man , we' ve all ...
it' s not encouraged .
okay .
okay , screw this .
pawn to king 2 .
knight to queen' s bishop 6 .
check .

21 00 : 07 : 58, 587 > 00 : 07 : 59, 986 i didn' t even see that .
i was just wondering ...

some time this week .
probably all suntanned , the prick .
let' s see ...
king to king' s bishop 8 .
rook takes queen .
check .
dammit .
damn !
sorry .
shut up i don' t need your sympathy .
where is owen ?
you' re trying to psych me out or what ?
i can' t hear myself think .
owen ...
owen is probably out sick again .
that would be my best guess .
you sure ?
yes .
yes !
despite your rather transparent tactics , brainman , prepare to die .
bishop to queen' s knight 7 .
checkski !
queen takes bishop .
i believe that' s checkski mateski .
what ?
no way .
ah come on , how did you ... ?
you freak of nature !
you know the other night i heard some noise .
noise ?
yeah .
in owen' s room , like a ...
like a scuffle .
really ?
yeah .
you don' t think that ... ?
you dreamt it .
no , look ...
you dreamt it .
you' re always complaining about your nightmares .
they come for you at night .
what ?
they come for you at night .
who does ?
they do .
drop it .
they do .
enough !
what are you suicidal ?
good .
they didn' t forget lunch this time .
goat cheese salad with ginseng ,
liver fricase and mango sorbet .
eeewh .
must be you .
hey !
wha .. ?
oh !
sorry .
bless us our lord for these thy gifts which we' re about to receive , from thy bounty through you , lord .
amen .
amen .
down the hatch .
please record rem sleeper in room 17 24 09 " .
let' s go .
okay .
zooming out of 06 , 12 , 21 .
and zooming in to 17 , 24 , 9 .
here we go .
hot patching gear works and flipping to rem reader mode .
locating subject .
subject located .
zooming in .
wow ...
keep your tongue in your mouth , brainman .
we' re on the clock .
are we locked ?
sorry .
locked on .
thank you .
arm extension , go .
calibrating ...

i got it , i got it .
light her up .
interscan is locked .
commencing rem read .
mommy !
mommy help !
anna !
no !
no !
anna !
okay .
now let' s cycle back .
and there you have it .
if you do this long enough , you can do it in your sleep .
in your sleep ...
recording dreams in your sleep .
that' s funny .
when' s the last time you remember being outside ?
last night .
i had a dream of being at the beach .
no , i mean really outside , not a dream .
i ...
i don' t remember .
i' ve been busy lately .
overloaded , actually .
picking up slack .
for you , i might add .
i don' t remember either .
isn' t that weird ?
you' re weird .
shut up and let me concentrate .
dammit !
you know , i was just thinking ...
stop thinking .
what' s gotten into you ?
what' s gotten into me ?
you know who these are ?
they' re chickliss ' kids .
111 00 : 16 : 10, 227 > 00 : 16 : 14, 300 arthur and sunshine .
orphans .
they' re orphans .
you told me chickliss was on vacation .
i have to go to the can .
try not to drool on the controls .
it screws up the calibration .
bastards .
where is she ?
what have you done with her ?
where is ... ?
what have you done to me ?
why can' t i remember ?
why can' t i remember my daughter' s name ?
let me go !
get off me !
okay .
okay .
sorry .
it' s okay .
she' s one of us .
touch me again , soldier , and you' il be eating your eyeballs .
why soldier ?
what do you know about me ?
tattoo , on you forehead .
you' re on the squad , right killer ?
you show up by night and people disappear .
why did you do that ?
because you' re scum .
look miss , you have a certain disadvantage here .
none of us remembers how we got here , or pretty much anything else .
including who we are , so whatever you think you know about me ,
i don' t even know myself .
i don' t trust her .
she knows something .
thank god somebody does .
have you seen any children ?
a little girl ?
no .
my god .
i hope they don' t put kids in here .
that would be horrible .
what if they drop children in here ?
i gotta keep moving .
wait ! you gotta be careful climbing around here .
why ?
there are traps .
traps ?
how do you know ?
because of this .
that' s good bandage .
are you a doctor ?
i don' t know .
i did it .
i may be freakin ' mother teresa for all i know , but i don' t remember .
you remember something .
before all of this .
not much .
being chased through the woods , by guys like you .
the tattoo set me off .
when i first woke up , i don' t think i would have known my own name if it wasn' t stitched on my shirt .
i don' t even know if this is my name .
i feel like we' ve been here for hours and i still can' t remember anything !
give her a moment ...
fine .
a moment .
we gotta get moving while we still have our strength .
you guys have a plan ?
we keep moving in the same direction until we find the edge .
this place has got to end eventually .
what about the traps ?
we test the rooms .
we have a system .
it' s safe !
i' m going in !
help !
hjlp !
what kind of animals would do this ? !
does she look familiar to you ?
i keep thinking i' ve seen her before ...
i wonder what she' s in for .
you' re making a mistake .
huh ?
what the first rule i taught you about this job ?
neatness counts ?
very funny .
don' t get involved .
i know , i' m not getting involved ok ?
i' m drawing .
you have your chess , owen has his fish , chickliss ...
can we spend 5 minutes without bringing up owen and chickliss please ?
and get us back on real time .
you' re gonna get us in trouble .
i' il show you three ways to beat that game if you answer one question .
fine .
what ?
okay , what i wanna know ...
hold it .
show me .
okay .
check mate .
you win .
that' s brilliant .
do that again .
what do you know about a third exit ?
what ?
a third exit .
an auxiliary exit that leads directly outside .
there' s no such thing .
owen said there was .
he said chickliss found more plans ...
they were having you on .
no way .
i think that that' s why they' re gone .
i think they' ve found something ...
i think you' d better stop listening to old wives ' tales .
listen to me .
this conversation in over .
don' t you ever worry ?
about what ?
one day , you' re gonna wake up inside .
the only way i' m gonna wake up inside , is if i keep on talking to you .
no .
these things are useless !
the sensors there must' ve been different .
maybe they' re not motion sensors .
maybe they' re triggered by heat , or sound , or something ... !
why don' t you just admit it ?
we' re dead !
he can' t admit it .
it' s the training .
the army never admits defeat .
you got a problem with me lady ?
yeah .
why ?
i don' t trust you .
oh , how the hell did we miss this ?
what is it ?
c. i. a " .
what is that ?
clues to who built this place ?
i think that' s just a coincidence .
try the other doors .
y. y. o " .
u. d. s " .
s. a. n " .
what do they mean ?
i think it' s a mistake to think of these letters as meaning something .
it' s like some kind of code or puzzle we have to figure out .
a puzzle ?
they' re playing with us !
we should make a map .
using what ?
our blood ?
i don' t know .
maybe .
you got a better idea ?
i have a better idea .
i need something .
i need ...
your hair pin .
they did us the favour of polishing our boots .
okay , we' il find the safe rooms .
c i a. give me the others .
y. y. o " , " u. d. s
and s a n.
good memory .
yeah , in the short term .
now i wish i could remember what happened to me between birth and about 3 hours ago .
right .
i dunno ...
shoe polish and a hair pin .
nothing in this place is random .
maybe the bastards just underestimated us .
so near and yet so far .
yeah , but she' s doing better than most .
i mean half of them don' t even notice the letters , let alone map them .
i meant the chess .
give it up .
she doesn' t stand a chance .
of course she has a chance .
yeah ?
you' re gonna ride in on your white horse and whisk her out ?
the rooms can realign to zero position .
no it happens , and then she' il figure out the letters and uhh ... sail through .
and what' s the first thing the program does when the rooms realign to zero position ?
clean sweep .
exactly .
the only thing that' s gonna sail through that is their ashes .
cheer up buddy .
you' il catch you another one .
the boys upstairs like ' em young and pretty .
don' t you ever feel guilty ?
don' t you ever feel ?
son , you' re outta line .
yeah whatever ...
excuse me ?
why don' t you stop your doodling and do some work for a change ?
like what ?
we' re waiting for orders , it' s what we do best .
it' s what we do .
clean up your space .
it' s disgraceful .
you' re kidding , right ?
do i look like i' m kidding ?
this one' s s d f.
wait a minute .
what ?
i don' t know if this makes any difference ,
but they' re not periods , they' re commas .
he' s right .
they' re commas .
okay , so they' re commas .
what difference does it make ?
we don' t even know what the letters mean yet .
i mean if they were numbers , i' d understand the commas .
understand the commas how ?
well isn' t that how you plot coordinates on a graph ?
x coordinate , comma , y coordinate , comma , z coordinate .
right .
so if the rooms were labelled with numbers ,
like " 10, 1, 7 " , you' d know something about the room' s position .
yeah but we' ve got letters that so far tell us absolutely nothing .
that' s where you' re wrong , soldier .
the letters tell us one important fact the number never would .
what fact ?
there are only 26 letters in the english alphabet .
so ?
so we know the parameters .
exactly .
if each room has its own unique letter combination ,
then it' s a pretty good bet that this whole place is a cube with 26 rooms on each side .
worst case scenario , we' re anywhere from 1 to 25 rooms away from the edge .
let' s go !
great !
actually , it' s your turn to go first .
s o s. no kidding .
ahh ..
guess we' il try another way .
rains , rains , rains , rains ...
cassandra .
the little girl' s name is anna .
protests and strikes .
troublemakers up north .
the whole country' s going to crap .
ungrateful pigs .
herregud ...
oh my god , oh my god ...
what is it now ?
please tell me that' s not ...
would you put that away ?
there' s no consent form .
what ?
there is not pink page , the consent form is missing !
so ?
so ? !
you know the rules .
she can' t be in there without a consent form !
you think they' re gonna stop this whole operation because you lost a piece of paper ?
i didn' t lose it .
look you know how anal these guys are .
maybe she' il get another hearing .
listen to yourself !
but this could be huge !
a mistrial !
oh sure , anything you say .
look ...
see ?
told you i recognized her .
opposition leaders stage illegal strike
she' s a political .
so that would explain it .
what do you mean ?
i mean , there might not be a consent form .
get it ?
but that' s illegal .
you know for a child prodigy , you ain' t too bright .
we gotta do something .
like what ?
we gotta let ' em know upstairs .
and how are we gonna do that ?
call up .
it' s just for emergencies .
well what do you think this is ?
i don' t see a fire .
i don' t see a gas leak , or flooding .
i don' t see you writhing on the floor in the throws of a heart attack
but god knows right now i' d like to !
she' s gonna die in there and she' s probably innocent !
none of them are innocent !
you read the files .
you know what kind of people end up in there !
exactly !
all we know is what we read in the files ...
oh my god ...
what if it' s all bogus ?
the files , the crimes , everything .
maybe they' re just putting anyone in there they don' t like , maybe ...
there' s a purpose , and there' s a plan .
and i' m not so stupid to think that there' s no plan just because i don' t understand it !
we' re just the button men !
if we' re meant to be analysts , we' d be working upstairs !
would you forget the party line for once and make the call ?
okay .
you do it .
you' re the hero .
just remember ,
she was in the news and they made her disappear .
how much easier would it be to get to you .
no one even know you exist .
who knows where you' il wake up tomorrow ?
hello ?
it' s for you .
yeah ?
sir .
yes , sir .
right away , sir .
yes , sir .
i understand , sir .
yes , sir .
we' ve got work to do .
someone' s at the exit .
our exit ?
what do we do ?
the exit procedure .
wait a minute .
i' ve never done this before .
don' t you usually do this with owen ?
that' s right my friend , but owen is not here , is he ?
and the rules clearly state that two senior technicians have to be present at all exit procedures .
right , but i' m not a senior technician .
hey !
i need help here .
that was a phone call from upstairs .
personal contact .
direct orders from above .
they never do that .
we can' t screw this up .
we ?
yes .
we .
as far as i understand , sir , only senior techs are allowed to perform the exit procedure .
perhaps it would be my be interest to abstain until receiving clearance from higher up .
you little prick .
okay .
okay , i get it .
look , you help me with this , i' il tell them about your girlfriend .
okay ?
when ?
what ?
when will you let them know ?
as soon as we' re done with this .
all right ?
okay .
what do i do ?
just follow my lead .
okay , here we go .
step one ,
visual confirmation of subject in exit room .
oh , no .
owen .
it' s owen .
shut up .
hello ?
hello ?
hello ?
hello ?
anyone there ?
hello ?
what now ?
please !
question one .
please state your name .
huh ?
who are you ?
he doesn' t recognise your voice .
they fried his brain .
please state your name .
they fried his brain like the rest .
shut up !
i think it' s owen .
thank you .
do you believe in god ?
what ?
what ?
do you believe in god ?
what is this ?
screw you !
please answer yes or no .
what kind of god would do this to people ?
please answer yes or no .
no .
okay ?
no !
now let me go .
let me go !
god dammit .
let me out of here !
411 00 : 42 : 08, 787 > 00 : 42 : 09, 981 hit it .
i need a doctor .
what does it do ?
just hit it .
please !
for christ' s sake !
still want your girlfriend to sail through to the exit ?
he ...
he' s gone .
it' s over .
he was one of us .
no .
once inside , he' s one of them .
so this is your big exit procedure ?
what are we doing here ?
do you believe in god ?
it all hinges on that ?
i just read the questions and push the buttons , okay ?
what happens if you push yes ?
i don' t know .
no one' s ever said yes .
here .
send this upstairs .
do it !
do you believe in god ?
what kind of animals would do this ?
owen is ...
owen is probably out sick again .
you sure ?
yes .
what are you doing ?
you' re not allowed in there .
i' m through pushing buttons .
no !
stupid !
stupid !
stupid !
i' m inside .
okay ...
thank god .
you stupid jackass !
good evening , mr. dodd .
i believe these belong to you .
well , it looks that you got yourself a little bit of a situation down here .
may we ?
the boys upstairs felt you could perhaps use a hand , and so , here we are .
my name is jax and these are my associates mr. finn and mr. quigley .
right .
gentleman , first things first , we locate our mouse .
he has no implant and so we have to do this the old fashioned way , i' m afraid .
mr. quigley , run a visual check on all rooms , he couldn' t have got far .
yes , sir .
mr. finn , run a probability tree on his potential movements .
let' s have some contingency , shall we .
right away , sir .
excuse me , mr. jax .
excuse me , sir .
yes mr. codd ?
it' s dodd , sir .
what do i do ?
i' m sorry ?
what do ... ?
yes i almost forgot i have your orders from upstairs .
it' s a personal delivery .
order number 7 9 3 , bla , bla , bla , bla ...
commence standard series of needle tests on rains group .
you do know what that means ?
yes , sir .
of course , sir .
all in a day' s work , sir .
right away , sir .
do us a tinsy favour and use mr. wynn' s auxiliary monitor .
we' il need the big guns here for our little mouse hunt .
of course , sir .
anything i can do to help , sir ...
that the spirit mr. modd , way to keep the world safe for democracy .
have we got a visual yet ?
still working on it , sir .
okay , k g k.
three odds .
m a q.
three odds .
safe .
like taking candy from a baby .
a z z " .
a z z " !
got it .
i don' t know why we bother with these things anymore .
a z z " .
it' s the first time i' ve seen a z.
do you think it means anything ?
i don' t know .
ah , don' t let the door close !
dammit !
she' s gone .
got it .
subject is isolated .
and now the tricky part .
okay .
you were last seen here .
that was an hour ago .
she should still be in the same coordinate .
the rooms move .
do they have to ?
she can' t be that far .
yeah but if we veer too far off course looking for her we' il never find the edge .
what do you suggest , killer ?
that we' il cut our losses ?
uh , guys .
are we sure this room is safe ?
maybe he just starved to death .
god i' m hungry .
what are you doing ?
we could use these .
we have to keep moving .
we have to get back on track .
we' ve already chased our tails for an hour looking for her .
god !
this headache is not going away ...
maybe it' s that chip in your head .
what ?
it' s true isn' t it ?
i mean they now put bio receivers in all you army boys .
keeps you on a leash .
lady you' ve got a hell of an imagination .
jackpot .
it' s her .
dammit .
is she all right ?
she' s not moving .
great .
wake up .
are you all right ?
rise and shine ...
is she ... ?
there' s a pulse .
she' s burning up .
can you hear me ?
oh my god .
what happened to you ?
idont know .
i feel sick .
i need a doctor .
don' t let her touch you !
let go !
watch it !
oh my god !
don' t leave me !
you just ...
i didn' t mean to ...
she scratched and i ...
you put her out of her misery .
my headache' s gone .
something' s eating her .
a chemical or a virus .
we never checked this room for traps .
it could be in the air .
let' s see your arm .
we' ve got to get outta here .
show me your arm .
he' s right , we' ve gotta get outta here .
your arm .
where she scratched you , let' s see it .
why , you think ... ?
yes , i think !
fine ! there , see ?
nothing !
flesh wound .
sure .
nothing .
what do we do with him ?
what do you mean ?
i think whatever was eating away at her , is spreading to him .
hey i' m still here !
not for long !
i say we ditch him .
screw you !
just relax guys , nobody' s ditching anyone .
look at him .
oh my god .
what ?
your face .
crap .
please don' t leave me .
this is horrible .
you wanna baby sit a dead man ?
be my guest .
please .
i' il do anything .
anything ?
from now on , you test the rooms .
all of them .
fine .
well , we' re not going down there .
no sense wasting a good boot .
help me !
he' s still alive down there !
forget it , he' s gone .
you heartless son of a bitch !
no !
don' t come near me .
i was protecting us .
you murdered him .
he was infected .
you saw it , it was spreading .
we' d be dead by now .
you don' t know that .
actually , he' s right .
it' s a highly contagious form of a virus .
flesh eating disease .
who the hell are you ?
i ...
i' ve come to help .
damn .
problem , mr. scrod ?
no problem sir .
anything of interest ?
actually sir , i was about to ...
would you care to share with the rest of the class ?
yes sir .
as i was running my test series as instructed sir ,
the query intersected with my subject , sir .
good work , rod .
who says they only hire the mentally challenged down here ?
open .
thank you , sir .
up on the main monitor now , please .
we keep ...
they , collect data and run tests .
all kinds of tests .
testing chemical and biological agents ,
measure brain activity , endurance , most of it i don' t even understand .
and that' s just what i see in my department .
i hear about others who do different work .
i even heard there are other facilities .
cubes .
christ .
i just heard rumours .
why can' t we remember anything ?
i don' t know ,
i always assumed that it was so they could have a blank slate to work with .
blank slate ?
bastards , you' ve been using us as lab rats .
hey man , not me .
i' m just the computer guy , system checks .
stuff like that .
oh yeah , you just followed orders .
yeah .
you make me sick .
look , you got it all wrong .
i hate my job .
you' re job ?
how can you do this to people .
it was your choice .
609 01 : 02 : 23, 667 > 01 : 02 : 26, 227 you volunteered , only you don' t remember anymore .
at least that what they told us .
and you believed them ?
well , yeah .
i saw the consent forms .
except for yours !
you' re lying !
who would volunteer for this ?
well it was either this or execution so ...
what ?
they say you' re all condemned prisoners , who volunteer for the experiment instead of facing the death penalty .
i never did anything to deserve this .
yeah well , tell it to meyerhold , right ?
we' re innocent , dammit !
i didn' t volunteer for this !
i know , because your consent form is missing !
shut up !
while you were doing your system checks , did you happen to see a little girl ?
no .
yes .
i mean , i saw her .
i saw one little girl ...
in your dreams .
what ?
yeah .
it' s hard to explain .
here .
you see , another thing they have us do , is record the subject' s , the people' s dreams .
her name' s anna , right ?
they can see into our dreams ?
yeah .
where is my daughter , you piece of shit ? !
i don' t know !
you' re lying !
no , please !
i came to help !
rains !
we need him .
why ?
i can show you the exits .
go ahead , where are they ?
you were wrong about the cube .
it' s only 25 rooms all around .
only 2 rooms have z coordinates valued 26 .
they periodically move to the perimeter , but those 2 exit points are monitored .
and there' s supposed to be an auxiliary exit .
that leads directly outside the cube .
how do we get to that one ?
i don' t know .
so what use is he ?
can you show us how to avoid the traps ?
yes , definitely .
okay .
just read me the coordinates from the surrounding rooms , please .
i was right .
the coordinates .
well , well ...
it seems that our little mouse , is a rat after all .
mr. finn , could you do something about that , please ?
yes , sir .
this one' s c f p.
the hell ... ?
damn .
what is it ?
the letters .
they just disappeared .
what ?
they' re all gone .
they know i' m here .
so now will be a good time to move .
good idea .
you first .
okay .
i can' t make any promises , but this should be the way .
mr. quigley , could you isolate that quadrant for me please ?
mr. finn , show me the current trap configuration , " s' il vous plait " .
merci " .
let' s make their life a little more interesting , shall we ?
okay ...
trapped .
sure looked easy from my desk .
they trapped all the rooms around us .
now what ?
really glad you showed up to help .
my god .
i' m actually starting to enjoy myself .
you know what ?
i think we should keep getting together and doing this more often .
god dammit .
what ?
sir .
yes , sir .
yes , sir .
sorry , sir .
right away , sir .
just finish it , you idiot .
ungrateful cretins .
you didn' t hear that .
okay gentleman , we have the word from on high .
it' s time to blow this popsicle stand .
mr. quigley .
sir ?
you heard the man .
just finish it .
yes sir .
okay , let me think , let me think .
what the ... ?
now what do we do ?
the floor . the floor .
i' m sorry .
god dammit !
i don' t wanna die in here !
what' s happening ?
what stopped it ?
i don' t know .
come on , you piece of ...
what the hell ?
i don' t know sir , we suddenly lost contact .
yes , i can see that .
why ?
maybe the energy required for the test itself blew out the capacitor .
i mean , we' re not talking state of the art equipment .
wrong .
that' s not how it works .
that' s not how it was designed .
someone is screwing with the connection .
i don' t know sir .
it isn' t me .
me neither , sir .
what ?
i have no idea .
it' s not me , i swear .
you wouldn' t lie to me , now would you mr. clodd ?
no sir .
wouldn' t think of it .
questions ?
comments ?
what are we waiting for ?
get us back online !
damn .
nothing .
" nothing " is not an answer .
excuse me , sir .
excuse me ?
what is it ?
can i use the facilities , sir ?
just go !
for the love of god , where do they find these people ?
i don' t think it' s software , sir .
it' s definitely a hardware problem .
listen .
this is getting embarrassing now .
okay ?
i needn' t remind you gentlemen , that in a few minutes we' il have no choice but to send people in there .
quigley !
finn !
you know , right of the top .
what is that noise ? !
something' s wrong with the main power source .
it' s gone into reset mode .
what the hell is going on ?
boot .
damn .
you can say that again .
what ?
power went out ?
yeah .
so the traps don' t work .
that' s the good news , yeah .
what' s the bad news ?
it' s gone into reset mode .
the system will restart itself in 10 minutes , the first routine that runs on restart , is a clean sweep .
is that as bad as it sounds ?
the clean sweep program flash incinerates anything still living in all the rooms .
so , we gotta move .
which way do we go ?
i don' t know .
okay , last time i ran the numbers you were pretty much in the centre of the structure .
so i guess we just keep going in the same direction until we get to the edge , right ?
great , so we' re back to square one !
do you have a better idea ? !
no .
i don' t .
' cause i' m not the one who uses people as a fucking guinea pigs !
wait !
back to square one !
dodd .
dodd is the only one who can power down this quickly .
but he knows that reset would kick in , so why would he ... ?
of course .
clean sweep happens after they realign to zero position .
what ?
quick .
let me see your map .
when the power comes on , the rooms are programmed to realign back to their original positions before the clean sweep starts . now , if we' re in one of the exit room , like a z z , it will move us to the perimeter , and we' il have about ... 3 seconds to get out .
before it fries us .
yeah .
if that room hasn' t moved , we' d might just make it .
yeah .
you know mr. wod has been in the little boy' s room an awfully long time .
come on .
gotcha
a noble attempt to save your protg , mr. dodd .
but quite foolish , ultimately .
may i have that widget back , please ?
i don' t think i can do that , sir .
mr. dodd , are you disobeying a direct order ?
yes .
there ...
cute , and rather , clich , in an endearing kind of way .
unfortunately , i do believe there is penalty , a rather strict penalty , for sabotaging state property .
instant paralysis !
they weren' t kidding , were they .
however , not to worry , mr. dodd ,
you still will be able to feel .
5 minutes to reset .
i think i found the source of our power problem .
does anyone knows where this goes ?
anyone ?
that the central coupling .
i got it , sir .
still doesn' t solve our observation problem , they could be escaping as we speak .
sir , in less then 5 minutes from now the clean sweep kicks in , and then i think our problem will evaporate .
mr. finn , i don' t trust machines .
i have a machine to thank for this , and this .
i need to see them , with my own god given eye .
of course sir , i just , i don' t know how ...
sometimes i even amaze myself .
mr. finn , one of our runaway rats is a former squad soldier .
is he not ?
yes sir , that would be haskell , the big fellow .
and they still bio chip the enlisted men , do they not ?
of course .
sir , that' s brilliant ...
mr. quigley comes through .
mr. finn , acquire us an uplink to the squad surveillance network .
yes sir .
right away , sir .
time ?
we still have 4 minutes !
hold on !
there' s no way he survived that .
we gotta go .
come on .
we' re locked on .
sir , we have a visual .
it' s a weak signal .
your tax dollars hard at work .
transmit the kill code .
pain inhibiters , activated .
neuro cam enhancers , amplified .
are we there yet ?
almost .
haskell ?
move it !
get off her !
thanks .
okay , come on .
how much further ?
we' re almost there .
a z z. this is it !
it' s okay .
the power' s out .
the power' s out .
chickliss ...
oh man ...
there' s over one minute !
can' t this thing go any faster ?
sir , we' ve got the grid display back .
they' re at the perimeter .
30 seconds to clean sweep .
well i think it' s time for our little surprise .
i hope your shortcut worked , mr. quigley .
water .
the auxiliary exit .
leads directly outside .
now what ?
can you swim ?
jump !
well ?
did we get them ?
845 01 : 22 : 39, 227 > 01 : 22 : 42, 617 sorry sir .
the signal got scrambled at flash point .
i think we got ' em
i don' t like it .
get a squad to the exit point .
this way !
come on .
run !
run !
go !
he' s conscious .
thank god .
well , welcome back mr. wynn .
you' re conscious .
so , we can begin now .
eric wynn ,
as you have been found guilty of high treason , sabotage
and various other crimes against your country and your god ,
and so on , bla , bla , bla ...
your sentence has been extended for two more lifetimes .
what sentence ?
i don' t remember the trial !
well , you were found guilty .
no further questions .
wait !
what are you doing ?
well , we' ve decided on a few modifications before putting you back inside .
wait !
mr. wynn , you are holding up progress .
don' t i get a choice ?
don' t all the condemned get a choice ?
i choose death !
no , mr. wynn .
you do not get a choice .
you have already made your choice .
i believe this is your signature ?
i don' t understand .
" i don' t understand " .
you chose to become a test subject .
many years ago .
and you simply don' t remember that .
it' s all standard procedure .
but my job ?
dodd ?
owen ?
chickliss ?
all lab rats .
just like you .
observing the observers , you know , that kind of thing .
very interesting results .
wait !
you' re actually starting to bore me now .
where is she ?
oh , the allusive ms. rains .
well , you needn' t worry about her .
you didn' t catch her .
he' s all yours .
don' t touch me .
don' t worry .
this wont hurt .
wait !
mommy , i' m cold .
why can' t we have a fire ?
because the bad people might find us .
i have something to show you .
see .
that' s us .
we' re superheroes .
these are very special because they were drawn by a very special person .
is he a superhero too ?
yes .
yes , he is .
what wrong with him ?
he doesn' t seem to know we' re here .
this room is green .
hi there .
this room is green .
yes , it is .
what is it , shock ?
i wanna go back to the blue room .
i think he' s mentally handicapped .
that' s all we need , a retard .
don' t !
how the hell did he survive in here ?
i wanna go back .
i wanna go back .
back .
back .
i wanna go back .
wanna go back .
