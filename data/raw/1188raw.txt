soft mattress ?
yeah , that could' ve been it .
it could have been the soft mattress .

try one of these scones , you' re gonna love ' em .
i' m a little traumatized to have a scone .
let' s move .

well , let' s talk about it .
i' m a good listener .

claire ?
she' s , you know , whatever , i don' t know .
she' s saving the world one maladjusted kid at a time .
but that' il all change when we' re married ,
' cause i want a wife .
i don' t want a fucking martyr , right ?
i hear that , my friend .
hey , man , listen , i i i i got ... do you remember that private detective we used to set up that fucking shearson lehman prick ?
the big sleazy , tommy gufano .
he' s a wop genius .
yes .
i need you to get some dirt on these two guys
john and jeremy ryan .
they' re brothers from new hampshire .
they got some sort of n. p. o. called " holy shirts & pants .
i will check into them .
excellent , bro .

oh , yeah .
yeah , this is better .
come on , use some muscle .
there we go .
all right , that' s good .
done .
done .
you know , i' m used to sailing down under with the kiwis , so everything is backwards .
even the toilets ... when you flush them , the water spins the opposite way .
really freaks you out the first time you see it .
john my boy , come on up here .
man " the woodwind " for a while .
on my way .
hey , your dad was telling me about a great beach near here that maybe we could check out if you have any interest when we get back .
yeah .
great .
okay , it can get confusing up here .
if you have a problem , just give me a call .
thank you .
thanks .
now how would one get to this sook' s bend ?
actually , it would be a really nice bike ride .
everything' s ready for the quail hunt !
for the quail hunt ?
yeah .
it' s a ... it' s a cleary family tradition .
well , i think you might have to deal me out on this ,
' cause we were gonna ...
nonsense , i insist .
john , you gotta go !
you' re gonna love it !
you' re gonna love it !
sack , honey , um , you' re a little bit sick for hunting .

you' re going .
so , i guess i' il see you later .
see you later .
just take it easy , okay ?
okay .
okay .
mr. environmental is also a a hunter .
it' s kind of an interesting combination .
i hunt quail , jeremy !
they' re overpopulated in this region and they' re decimating the grub worm population .
you got a fucking problem with that ? !
not nearly as much as i do with the , uh , attire that you have on , or just your general point of view towards everybody .
but let' s go kill some birds .
i' m psyched .
have you even shot one of these things before ?
the whole 17 years we' ve known each other ,
i' ve been sneaking off to go on little hunting trips around the world .
no , i don' t even know what the fuck a quail is !
i feel totally ridiculous .
like why do i have to be in camouflage ?
so the big bad quail doesn' t see me ?
i know .
it' s like , why can' t we hunt something cool
like a hawk , or an eagle , or something with some talons ?
that' d be awesome .
you mean , something like big game even like a gorilla ...
yeah .
gorilla !
or rhinoceros ...
rhino !
or a fucking human being ?
that' il get you jacked up .
that' s a little heavy .
i mean , like ... you' re hunting a human being right now , the most dangerous game .
like a worthy adversary .
not a human being that' s armed ...
oh , if he wasn' t armed . ... but a clever ... a clever human being
who knows the jungle , or the woods .
or like a bad guy .
there' s something not right about these guys .
what do you mean ?
i mean , it' s time to send them home .
sack , don' t do anything crazy .
just relax , i' m just gonna scare them a little bit .
all right .
to the right !
argh !
oo ooh !
ooh .
they got me !
oh , shit .
they got me !
oh , shit .
ow !
jesus !

and take care of him , okay ?
i want you to get my little angel up and running .
hang in there .
i hope you flip your bike over and knock your two front teeth out , you selfish son of a bitch !
you leave me in the trenches taking grenades , john !

it' s exactly what i get paid to do .
look , i want to know where claire is .
she took a bike ride down to the beach .
with who ?
with that fellow from the wedding that everyone seems to be so fond of .
so you' re a venture capitalist ?
what does that mean ?
oh , it' s really not that interesting , actually .
you don' t sound very enthused .
oh , no , it' s just ... you know , things started happening and you go down a road and you think it' s just for a little while .
and then you get caught up in it and you' re kind of into it and just don' t even have time to really ask questions about it .
and before you know it you' re living a life that you didn' t set out to , or that you intended to .
do you know what i mean ?
yes , i do .
i think that there' s some great things that i' d like to do , that that maybe i' m capable of , hopefully .
oh , yeah ?
like what ?
i don' t know .
we' il see .
i' m still young .
well ... you' re not that young .
i' m sorry .
give me your hands .
i know this game .
okay .
i' m not gonna bite you .
do you want it full speed or half speed ?
full .
you' re never gonna hit me , i don' t think .
i' m pretty quick .
what ?
let me get settled before you go .
you didn' t approve of that ?
no , because you' re supposed to ...
you gotta wait until i put them back !
come on !
so what about you ... with sack ?
is that a good thing ?
yes , i think it' s a ... good thing .
you don' t sound very enthused .
i am .
i ... well , i mean , i think i am , i ...
i' m ...
okay .
i g ... you know , we' ve just been talking so much about the future lately and , uh ...
i mean , i always assumed that we would get married .
but , uh ...
i' m scared .
i am .
but i think that that' s how everyone feels before they' re about to get married .
i mean , don' t you think ?
yeah , no .
don' t answer that .
that' s my rationalization and i' m sticking to it .
fair enough .
and i don' t mean to pry .
yes you do .
well , however it works out , i hope you ... uh , i hope you realize that you deserve somebody great .
i have an announcement .
i know that we said we were gonna wait , but , uh , given the spirit of this weekend well ...
claire , come on .
come on .
come on come on , it' s okay .
come on !
come on .
claire and i are getting married .
good , sack .
that' s wonderful !

yeah !

congratulations , young man !
welcome to the family !
this is wonderful !
look , kid , i' m sorry .
you win some , you lose some , right ?
let' s go home .
no , i' m not ...
i can' t ...
i can' t do that .
what are you talking about ?
look , i i think i' m in love with her .
yeah , i i i think ...
i think that you' re nuts .
that' s what i think .
i' m gonna tell her the truth .
jesus christ !
hey .
hey !
how are you !
okay , listen , gloria , you know that i think that you' re an amazing person , a really amazing person , but i feel like i have to be upfront with you .
i i i really don' t see this relationship going further than this weekend .
but i love you !
yeah , i think you' il learn as time goes on that there' s a difference between infatuation and love , you know ?
obviously , you' re gonna have strong feelings for me because you lost your virginity to me ,
but that doesn' t mean ...
oh , i wasn' t a virgin .
what ?
i wasn' t a virgin .
far from it .
i just thought that that' s what guys wanted to hear .
come on .
jeremy !
wow !
hello , son .
you okay ?
not now , father , please .
no offense to you ,
i think we might be on different wavelengths .
i think you' d just be spinning your wheels with me , but , uh , have a little of the sacrament here .
no one likes to drink alone .
we' il set you up .
there you go , get your hands on it .
take it while it' s hot .
take it while it' s hot .
i' m gonna pour till it' s on the tray .
here it is .
can i ask you a question , father ?
do you ever get horny ?
i' m sure you do .
i just ... in your position you' re not ... right ?
isn' t that you' re not allowed to ... sleep with anybody , right ?
does that get tough sometimes ?
you ever pull on yourself , or ...
no .
everything works ?
do you get swelled up still ?
yeah , of course .
well , what do you do ?
you pray .
yeah , i pray , too , you know what i mean ?
i mean , i believed that she was a virgin .
it hurts to be lied to like that .
it' s a horrible feeling to feel that way .
but i , you know , was looking to take advantage of something , too .
so could i really feel that bad ?
it' s not like i was who i was .
you know what i' m saying ?
so , fair play .
and let' s be honest with each other here , okay ?
let' s put all the cards on the table .
she' s fit for a straitjacket .
this broad' s fucked three ways towards the weekend .
and you wanna know what ?
i dig it !
it turns me on !
yeah !
it turns me on !
because you wanna know what the kicker is , father ?
maybe i' m a little fucking crazy !
that' s right !
maybe jeremy' s a little nuts .
maybe there' s something about me that i' m a little cuckoo .
i know it' s a surprise .
i know it' s not on the surface .
i mean , i had an imaginary friend when i was a kid .
his name was shilo !
we used to play checkers with each other every day , and bless his heart , shilo' d always let me win !
and that ain' t normal !
there' s something odd in that , but maybe that' s what it takes to make you feel
like you' re connected with somebody .
i don' t know !
but i know when that redhead starts getting kooky that something about me feels alive inside !
i' m diggin ' talkin ' with ya .
you' re a really enlightened cat and i like that about ya .
i think you' re a special special man .
okay , come in for the real thing .
mmm ?
mmm ?
get in here for the real thing .
i love ya .
you' re a sweet man .
oh , dear god .
you can' t marry this guy .
why ?
because i' ve fallen for you .
oh , good news travels fast .
excuse me .
sorry , thanks .
thanks .
trapster , talk to me .
no shit .
and do you maybe feel the same way ?
maybe .
maybe .
that' s all i needed to know .
but this is crazy , because i don' t know any ...
why ?
i don' t know anything about you !
what do you mean ?
you do investments in new hampshire and you have a crazy brother ...
well , actually , i need to talk to you about that .
it' s not a big deal , but maybe you want to sit back on the swing .
run !
johnny !
she' s trying to kill me !
grandma !
whoa whoa !
get the gun from her !
put the gun down !
mother , stop !
this is the real world , lady !
you can' t just go shooting people on a whim !
what did you do ?
i told you that in confidence !
that was a confession !
what are you talking about ?
why don' t you tell her , john ?
i don' t know what' s going on .
you don' t know ?
i' m playing catch up , too .
i don' t ...
sack , what are you doing ? !
remembering yet ?
you remember yet ?
are you okay ?
they' re not who they say they are , claire .
those aren' t even their real names .
what ? !
no , everything he told you is a lie .
i i don' t understand what you' re saying .
claire , they crash weddings .
they crash weddings so that they can sleep with girls .
everything that they have told us is a complete fabrication .
no , you' re joking .
all of it is a lie .
don' t you fucking get up .
sack , will you just stop ? !
okay okay .
is that true ?
no , well , no , it' s ... not entirely .
no , it' s a yes or no question .
i know , but it' s complicated .
yes or no ?
yes or no ?
yes ... with shades of grey .
oh .
i' m not perfect , but who are we kidding ?
neither are you .
and you wanna know what ?
i dig it !
jeremy tried to seduce me !
you did ?
i want my painting back .
the painting was a gift , todd .
i' m taking it with me .
you had me going , son .
i thought it was something special .
there' s a ferry leaving in 10 minutes .
i suggest you be on it .
come on , let' s go .
i want you .
i love you .
he made a fool out of you , claire .
come on , let' s go .
sweetheart .
now bunch those panties up into a little ball .
put that little ball right in your mouth .
oh , that' s good .
hang up the phone .
okay , and i will definitely call you back later then .
come on , wrap it up .
talk to you soon .
thank you , larry .
what the fuck ?
you can' t knock anymore ?
i know how i can get to her .
what ?
i know how i can get to claire .
oh , john , you gotta drop this thing .
i' m ...
i can' t do this anymore with you , okay ?
it' s been several months , and you haven' t heard anything from her .
she hasn' t returned your phone calls , she' s never responded to one of your letters ,
she didn' t respond to the candygram .
right .
god knows what happened to the little kitten that you got her .
because she didn' t keep it and i know you' re not raising that goddamn thing .
okay .
i think it' s very obvious at this juncture that she just flat out does not wanna see you .
i disagree .
now look , they' re having the engagement party for her tonight at the beach club .
we' re going at 7 : 30 .
i' m not g ...
john , i can' t ...
okay okay , listen to me , tasmanian devil .
listen to me .
i can' t go .
why ?
' cause i can' t go , because i have a schedule .
because i have ...
what is your deal ?
what is your problem ?

jeremy !
is that good ?
i' m so ready to take it to the next level too .
do you want to watch me with a girl ?
what about those brazilian twins we met at the ballgame ?
i i was ...
i was ...
i was thinking more along the lines of an ... of an ... of an engagement .

that sounds ... that sounds unbelievable .
the brazilian girls were very nice .
they seemed like ...
oh , jeremy , i do !
i love you .
i love you .
i i can' t believe that they' re getting married .
i mean don' t you you think that' s really soon ?
well , you know gloria .

has to have what she wants when she wants it .
well , we had to give her a sweet 16 on her 13th birthday .
you remember that .
yeah , i remember , but this is ...
dad , this is marriage !
when you know what you want , you know what you want .
so ... which of these do you like ?
um ... well , i could ...

claire bear .
yeah ?

we have no way of knowing what lays ahead for us in the future .
all we can do is use the information at hand to make the best decision possible .

oh , i' m hang gliding !
honey , take a good picture ...
i' m dead !
what a freak !
you met her at a funeral .
yeah , i' il throw in a wedding every now and then , but funerals are insane !
the chicks are so horny , it' s not even fair .
it' s like fishing with dynamite .
horny ?
yeah , crazy horny .
i just ... at a funeral ? !
grief is nature' s most powerful aphrodisiac .
huh .
look it up .
i didn' t know that .
that' s what i' ve learned .
ma , the meatloaf !
fuck !
saturday ...
i got one saturday .
you' re coming with !
chaz , i' m ...
i' m sorry , i don' t ...
i' m not judging you , ' cause i think you' re an innovator , but ... there' s no way i' m ready for that .
a time to plant , and a time to pluck up that which is planted ;
a time to kill and a time to heal ;
a time to break down and a time to build up ;
a time to weep and a time to laugh ;
a time to cast away stones ...
so senseless .
damn you , roger .
roger !
oh !
damn you , roger !
damn it !
damn you !
i' m in pain .
i' il try to fight it .
try to fight it .
i don' t know about you people , but i' m in pain .
i know that there is no good in them for man to rejoice and to do good in his life ... for that which befalleth the sons of men , befalleth beasts .
even one thing befalleth , as the one dieth , so dieth the other .
yea , they all have one breath , so that a man hath no preeminence above the beast .
while each man thinks he knows love ,
love , we have learned , is a mystery .
that' s what makes today so special .
we witness two people choosing to marry ones they truly love .
whoa whoa , hey !
hey hey !
he' s the best man .
yeah .
thank you .
i don' t believe this .
hat in hand .
i' m sorry i' m late .
i' m glad you' re here .
and and i' m sorry i called you white trash .
i didn' t ...
john , apology accepted .
and i' m sorry i called you a hillbilly ,
i don' t even know what that meant .
john , it' s okay .
do you mind if i get married now ?
no , go ahead .
hi , todd .
although we may choose whom we marry ,
we don' t always choose ...
psst .
claire , i' m not here to bother you ,
i just came to be his best man .
don' t worry about me .
pretend i' m not here .
okay .
i' m not a nut .
you look really pretty , by the way .
that' s all i' m gonna say .
i can' t stop thinking about you .
it' s all i think about and i don' t know what to do .
ahem .
i' m sorry .
that' s what makes today so special ...
god , i miss you .
okay , excuse me , i' m sorry .
claire , hold on a second .
claire , claire !
claire , will you wait just a second ?
all i wanted was a second alone so i could try to explain things .
but i' ve never gotten that chance .
maybe i don' t deserve it .
so here goes .
for longer than i care to remember , my business has been crashing weddings .
i crashed weddings to meet girls .
business was good .
i met a lot of girls .
and it was childish , it was juvenile ...
and pathetic .
yeah , that' s probably the best word to describe it .
but you know what ?
it also led me to you .
so it' s hard for me to completely regret it .
and that person that you met back at your folks ' place ... that was really me .
maybe not my name ...
i' m john beckwith by the way ... or my job , but the feelings we felt the jokes , the stupid laughs ... that was all me .
i' ve changed .
i' ve realized something .
i crashed a funeral earlier , and i ...
oh , jesus .
it wasn' t my idea .
i was basically dragged to it .
i went with chaz , who you forgot to tell me is totally insane .
he also might be a genius because it actually does work .
he' s cleaning up .
john .
i' m sorry .
i' m sorry , i' m sorry .
that' s neither here nor there .
and i see this widow and she' s a wreck .
she' s just lost the person she loves the most in this world .
and i realized we' re all gonna lose the people we love .
that' s the way it is .
but not me , not right now .
because the person i love the most is standing right here , and i' m not ready to lose you yet .
claire , i' m not standing here asking you to marry me .
i' m just asking you ... not to marry him .
and maybe take a walk .
take a chance .
wow !
wow !
this congregation really doesn' t care about how depressing your life is , john , okay ?
claire , baby , could you just ... could you go back up on the altar so we can have a wedding ?
i' m sorry .
i am .
what ?
i can' t marry you .
secretary ... your daughter' s a little ...
sack , i' ve always liked you ... so i put up with your stories about scallops and otters , and it' s all good because you seemed to make her happy and that' s what matters to me most .
but this is her decision .
huh .
i stand by my daughter .
you don' t know shit .
claire , go back up on the altar .
no .
claire !
claire , get up on that altar right now .
stop it .
claire , get your fucking ass
on that altar right now !
wow , getting a nice preview or what marriage is gonna be like with ike turner here .
sack !
oh god , here it goes .
share that with the dalai lama , jackass .
i think i had him .
i know you did .
just go kiss the broad .
would it be a total clich if i kissed you right now ?
yes .
just wonderful .
so damn beautiful !
with every death there comes rebirth .
it' s the circle of life .
we' re gonna be all right .
hey .
uh uh uh .
hey .
uh uh !
so , what' s next ?
i' m starving .
fujimora wedding , 3 : 00 p. m.
hey hey .
i' m just throwing it out .
i' m just saying , just ...
they would have great tempura .
we don' t even have a back story , i just ...
no , forget it , forget it .
i' m talking out loud .
we' re a folk singing group
from salt lake city !
yeah !
yes we are .
# in the morning don' t say you love me #
# ' cause i' il only kick you out of the door #
# stay with me ... #
# measure me in metered lines #
# and one decisive stare #
# the time it takes #
# to get from here to there #
# my ribs that show through t shirts #
# and these shoes i got for free #
# i' m unconsoled #
# i' m lonely #
# i am so much better #
# than i used to be #
# and i' m leaning #
# on this broken fence #
# between past and present tense #
# and i' m losing #
# all those stupid games #
# that i swore #
# i' d never play #
# but it almost feels okay #
# circumnavigate this body #
# of wonder #
# and uncertainty #
# armed with every precious failure #
# and amateur cartography #
# i' m breathing deep before #
# i spread those maps out #
# on my bedroom floor #
# and i' m leaning #
# on this broken fence #
# between past and present tense #
# and i' m losing #
# all those stupid games #
# that i swore #
# i' d never play #
# but it feels okay #
# and i' m leaving #
# with goodbye #
# and i' m losing #
# but i' il try #
# with the last ways left #
# to remember sing #
# my imperfect offering . #
# sailing on this boat away tonight #
# thinking i might drown if the waves aren' t right #
# wind pushing me from side to side #
# and i' m thinking #
# of what i had #
# and my sweetheart #
# and my sweetheart #
# and if i never see you #
# again #
# i just want you to know #
# what i think #
# sunday took me out for a walk in the park #
# and as the dark ran round , the track lights lit up #
# people running round in their shorts in the rain #
# again #
# and again #
# thinking that you' re my sweetheart #
# you' re my sweetheart #
# i can hardly see the road #
# but i' m gonna try #
# yeah , i' m gonna try #
# ' cause you' re my sweetheart #
# you' re my sweetheart #
# and if i never see you #
# again #
# i just want you to know #
# what i think #
# if you' ve got to run #
# yeah , i' il be there #
# if you' ve got to run . #
# now kiri waits it out #
# but she' s only young enough for some things #
# healing the sick and dumb #
# and low on the radar , the smoking gun #
# we' re moving fast enough to function #
# fast enough to function #
# maybe it' s me #
# ' cause i seem to think in twos and threes #
# you find your open door #
# and through the skids i sail #
# and keep that love #
# underground #
# ooh , ooh ooh ooh #
# ooh ooh ooh #
# ooh ooh #
# ooh , ooh ooh ooh #
# ooh ooh ooh #
# ooh ooh #
# ooh , ooh ooh ooh #
# ooh ooh ooh #
