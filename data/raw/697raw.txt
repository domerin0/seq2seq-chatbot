ohh .
ted , are you all right ?
sure .
aah .
oh .
ok .
ok , ted .
ok , let' s roll .
all right , folks , let' s go .
it' s over .
so , anyway , uh ... school ended a couple days later ... and her father got transferred ... to florida in july .
so i worked all summer ... to pay off those debts and ...
well , i never saw mary again .
that was ... what ?
13 years ago .
that' s very interesting .
anyway ...
i know it' s not the type of thing you' d forget ... but i guess i just ...
i kinda ...
i must have blocked it out of my head or something ...
' cause i was driving down the highway last week ... and i started thinking about mary ... and all of a sudden ... it was like i couldn' t breathe .
i mean , i was ...
i was ...
i felt like i was gonna die .
so i pulled off the road ... and i just sorta stopped in this ...
i guess it was a rest area .
i was just kind of shaking and ...
you know ... rest areas are homosexual hangouts .
how about you ?
the big " l.
hmm ?
ever been ?
what ?
in love .
well ... once .
mary .
oh , god .
not mary again .
look , i know it was brief ... but it was ...
it was definitely love , dom .
i mean ... crushes don' t last for 13 years , right ?
what ever happened to mary ?
i told you ... she moved with her family to miami .
so why don' t you look her up ?
i did ... once .
i called .
she wasn' t listed .
so that' s it ?
you get one little bump in the road and give up ?
it' s probably for the best .
after 13 years ... she' s probably gonna think i' m a stalker or something .
you know what you should do is hire a private investigator .
you know , to find her , follow her around .
she won' t know anything .
no way !
that' s way too creepy .
besides , she' s probably married ... with a couple of kids by now .
girls like mary ... they don' t stay single .
hey , i' ve got an idea .
there' s this guy down in my office .
his name' s healy .
he' s a claims investigator .
he' s a hell of a bloodhound .
he shoots down to miami every couple of weeks .
he can help you out .
this guy runs a little hot , but he gets thejob done .
so ...
dom says you' re looking for some lady friend .
you knew back at school .
yeah .
yeah .
i don' t buy it , but it' s cute .
you' re not buying what ?
ted , i' m the kind of guy ... who likes to shoot from the hip .
ahem .
i want you to level with me .
come on , let' s talk .
did you knock this skirt up ?
huh ?
no .
she' s blackmailing you , right ?
blackmailing me ?
no .
you want her dead , don' t you ?
dead ?
were you ...
you' re not serious , are you ?
you expect me to believe ... this is a straight stalker case ?
come on !
ahh .
looks like we found your mary , ted .
husband ... negative .
children and a labrador ... negative .
tight little package ... affirmative .
seeking sensitive wasp doctor ...
to share candlelit dinners ...
long walks in coconut grove ... marriage .
is she looking for a corpse ?
you have to be specific when you write those .
you have to say " seeking deaf mute ...
with , " you know ...
3 pound cock and trust fund .
i want a guy who can play 36 holes ... and still have enough energy ... to take me and warren to a ball game ... and eat hot dogs .
i' m talking sausage hot dogs , beer .
not light beer , but beer .
that' s my ad .
print it up .
mmm .
fatty who likes beer and golf .
jeez , mary ... where you gonna find a gem like that ?
ok , well , here' s the catch ...
he has to be self employed .
like a drug dealer ?
no , i was thinking along the lines , maybe ... of somebody like ... an architect or something .
but i want somebody with freedom in theirjob ... you know ?
somebody who can do it anywhere ... and just leave at a drop of a hat .
and where would you and your beer bellied architect ... be going to ?
mmm .
super bowl ?
that' s good .
i don' t know .
maybe a few months in nepal .
mm hmm .
and you' d probably dump the poor guy ... halfway to katmandu .
what' s that supposed to mean ?
it means you change your mind too much .
no , i don' t .
oh , come off it , mary .
remember that gorgeous corn fed white boy honey ... that you just dumped like yesterday' s garbage .
what was his name ?
pack man .
ok .
we had fun for a while .
mary , cut the crap .
what really happened with brett ?
yeah .
brett seemed so sweet .
you know what tucker said brett told him ?
he said that if warren wasn' t in my life ... that he would have popped the question ... a long time ago .
oh .
what a schmuck .
to hell with brett , you know ?
pop , you wanna get me a whiskey sour ... when you get a sec ?
whiskey sour coming up .
got some excellent news for you my friend .
oh , yeah ?
excellent ?
i think your life' s about to change .
really ?
so ... so you found her ?
oh , yeah .
and you were right , man .
she really is something else .
my god .
really .
so ... so she hasn' t ... she hasn' t changed at all , huh ?
well , that i couldn' t say .
let me ask you something .
was mary a little big boned back in high school ?
big boned ?
no , no .
not at all .
no .
i guess she packed on a few pounds over the years .
oh , yeah .
so she' s a little ... she' s a little chubby ?
oh , i' d say about a deuce , deuce and a half .
not bad .
oh , my .
a deuce and a half , huh ?
you know .
you shit out a bunch of kids ... and you' re bound to put on a few pounds .
oh , so she' s , um ... she' s married .
no , no .
she' s never been .
that' s the good news .
huh ?
4 kids , 3 different guys ... but no rock .
hyperactive little fuckers , too .
tough to keep up with in a wheelchair , i bet .
she' s in a wheelchair ?
mary' s in a wheelchair ?
i thought that was part of your kick .
excuse me , i ordered a whiskey sour .
yeah , whatever .
are you sure it' s the same mary ?
are you sure you have the right person ?
oh , yeah .

no , i don' t think ...
i ...
i mean , yes , it does ...
ok , i got all the information you need .
i got it off her bookie .

you really should look her up , ted .
i mean , she' s a real spark plug , this one .

i' m sort of burnt out on talkin ' about it .
oh , i' m sorry .
it' s just a job , really .
you know , something to keep me moving .
my real passion is my hobby .
really ?
what' s that ?
i work with retards .
isn' t that a little politically , um , incorrect ?
well , the hell with that .
no one' s gonna tell me ... who i can and can' t work with , right ?
no .
i mean ...
we got this one kid ...
mongo .
he' s got a forehead ...
like a drive in movie theater ... but he' s a good ship ... so we don' t bust his chops too much .
so one day , mongo gets out of his cage ...
what , they keep him in a cage ?
well , it' s ... it' s just an enclosure ...
no , but they keep him confined .
right , yeah .
that' s bullshit !
well , that' s what i said !
so i went out ... and i got him , um , i got him a leash .
a leash !
yeah , one of those ones ... you can hook onto the clothesline ... and he can run back and forth .
and , uh , there' s plenty of room ... for him to ... to dig and , uh , play .
that kid has really , uh ... he' s really blossomed , you know ?
now i can , uh , take him to movies .
baseball games .
fun stuff .
yeah .
sounds cool .
oh , yeah , it' s cool for them ... but for me it' s much more than that .
for me , it' s ... it' s heaven .
y' know ?
those goofy bastards are just about ... the best thing i' ve got goin ' in this ... crazy world .

i don' t watch the new ones .
well , you should because it' s probably ... the greatest love story of our time .
the point is ... is that love isn' t about ... money or social standings ... or age .
