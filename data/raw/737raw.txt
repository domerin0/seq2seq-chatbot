and now for all you romantics out there , this one is for you .
hello , betty .
shouldn' t you be at the hospital , looking after a certain other soldier ?
is there any way you can find it in your heart to forgive me ?
i wonder if these two get together .
i' il forgive you on one condition .
what' s that ?
dance with me .
explain one thing to me .
what kind of desperate and pathetic emotional cripple would actually buy that as an ending ?
rosie , do you think that in real life
tad hamilton is the man he seems to be on the screen ?
absolutely .
i mean , you just can' t fake that kind of thing .
what do you think tad hamilton is doing right now ?
i' il bet he' s in church .
watch this .
yeah !
whoo !
told you that was him , right ?
yeah .
tad hamilton .
you don' t make it easy on us , tad .
what do you mean ?
this is the shot the paparazzi got .
congratulations .
you' re actually drinking , driving , smoking ,
leering and groping at the same time .
which , on the one hand , is just about the coolest thing " ve ever seen .
richard .
but , on the other hand , it can be argued this might be bad for the image .
you play characters who have heart .
this is a person who will have a heart attack .
i can' t believe you guys are blaming my unemployment on this photograph .
you are not unemployed .
dockworkers are unemployed .
you are simply between million dollar paydays .
as are we , since we both get a percentage of your payday .
but this isn' t about us .
whatever happened to that part in the jimmy lng movie ?
im perfect for that .
well , he' s taking a breath .
he' s what ?
he' s taking a breath .
he' s pausing before deciding .
he' s hemming and hawing and taking a breath .
and this is only going to make him breathe more .
what do we do ?
asphyxiate the son of a bitch .
we generate a little positive pr .
what are you , an interpreter ?
i' m saying we just need to do something , tad , to remind jimmy lng and america that you are the boy next door .
i am the boy next door , if you happen to live in a very dysfunctional neighborhood .
congratulations .
you' ve eaten your body weight in pringles .
what' s your favorite pringle ?
sour cream and onion or original ?
well , the sour cream and onion has a very strong taste .
so if you' re eating a small amount , half a can , you want that strength .
but if you' re eating more , you want the original .
it' s a cleaner flavor .
wait until you discover barbecue flavor .
you' il finally become a woman .
how' s modern grocer treating you over there , pete ?
this is the swimsuit issue .
oh , my god .
what is it ?
win a date with tad hamilton .
what ?
it' s to benefit save the children .
that is so like him .
saving children .
i know .
ohhh !
should i enter ?
why not ?
sure .
heaven is just a mouse click away .
a mouse click and 100 buck donation .
we can raise 100 bucks .
with your permission , petey .
im sorry ?
paper or plastic ?
paper , please .
would you help rosalee win a date with tad hamilton and help save the children ?
i certainly would .
aren' t these great ?
the best .
along with a $125 check in recognition of yet another piggly wiggly store manager of the month award .
congratulations .
thank you , mr. ruddy .
so , pete , when do we lose you to richmond ?
because you' re running out of wall space here .
well , i got my acceptance letter to virginia state .
that' s good .
and i got my student loan .
so , there' s just one more thing .
what ?
there' s someone here that i ...
i need to have a discussion with about the going to richmond with me issue .
jars are full .
i love everybody in this store so much .
sorry for interrupting .
sorry .
it was nice to meet you .
it was nice to meet you , too .
good night .
good night .
are you taking off ?
yes , sir .
muchas gracias .
hasta el proximo miercoles .
i am the albanian one , mr. hamilton .
i' m sorry .
could you tell the other one ...
muchas gracias " and " hasta el proximo miercoles .
will do .
thank you .
ok , what do i need to beat you ?
double 14 , or it' s all over .
that' s not going to be a problem .
don' t miss .
don' t miss , don' t miss , don' t miss , don' t miss , don' t miss .
um , are you actually doing that ?
yeah .
and now pete will get the bartendress' s attention .
she' s waiting for you .
and we' re waiting for our round , pete .
fine .
angelica .
yes , pete ?
what is the object of your desire ?
we need another round .
one day , pete , one day ,
i know that the answer to that question will be " you , angelica .
you are the object of my desire .
ok .
but for now we' il just go with the beers .
oh , pete .
enough .
thank you , ladies .
you don' t like her the teeniest , tiniest bit ?
what ?
rosie ...
no , she' s not my type , ok ?
you are so particular .
who the heck are they ?
if that fire alarm went off again ...
why would they send a news crew for that ?
wait a second .
right here , please .
in first class you get a dvd player and may view the film of your choice .
i' d like to touch intimately whoever thought of that .
we would like to begin boarding our first class passengers .
that' s you .
i know .
guys .
just take it easy , ok ?
just give me a hug and tell me to have a good time , please ?
ok .
just be careful , ok ?
what do you mean ?
i mean that this guy is tad hamilton .
in his life , he' s probably slept with like 15 , 20 women .
no way .
that' s not even physically possible .
besides , like he' s going to be interested in me .
if he claims he doesn' t like watching sports , he' s trying to sleep with you .
got it .
if he claims to love animals , he' s trying to sleep with you .
ok .
guys are guys .
rich or poor .
famous or grocers .
right .
just do me one favor , ok ?
guard your carnal treasure .
ok .
just guard your carnal treasure .
thanks , pete .
remember everything .
i will .
remember how he smells .
i will .
but not just vaguely .
i want good , solid similes . he smells like a forest on the first day of spring .
ok , cathy .
you' re going to miss your flight .
i will bring you similes .
thank you .
i almost forgot .
i got you something .
it' s regular flavor .
in case you don' t like the prime rib in first class .
thank you , pete .
right this way .
just guard your carnal treasure .
i heard you .
that' s me .
welcome to los angeles .
e
oh !

no .
do you want to think about it ?
gee , what ...
tell me why you' re making me have dinner with an okie .
because she' s wholesome as the amber waves of grain .
and she' s not an okie .
she' s from west virginia .

rosalee futch .

it' s very nice to meet you , tad .
it' s so nice to meet you , tad .
it' s great to meet you .

smile for the cameras .
no brown liquor or cigarettes .
fine .

i passed ashton kutcher in my car and he seemed happy .
he' s happy for other reasons .
im sorry .
we have not heard from jimmy lng .
hey , guys , how' s this in the shoulders ?
seriously .
because i got some yoga stuff .
your films will stand the test of time .
your films will stand the test of time .

your standing films will time and test themselves .
thank you .
you' re pretty .

yikes a bee .
so , how was your flight ?
your films will stand the test of time .
thank you .
so , you ready ?
for what ?
right this way .
rosalee futch .
it' il take a few minutes for the spots in your eyes to go away , but they will .
ok .
we' re right here .
is it always like that ?
well , pretty much .
shake a doo .
shake a what ?
it just means " wow .
shake a doo .
shake a doo , i like that .
so ...
you excited ?
are you kidding ?
this is like a fairy tale .
yeah , i figured .
you ok ?
yeah .
i' m just not used to sitting sideways like this .
we don' t have sideways seating in west virginia .
and i think the cigarette smoke is kind of ...
you can come sit back here if you like .
i can' t really move right now .
boy , i don' t feel well . " ve always been kind of motion sickness y .
once , this carnival came to fraziers bottom , and they had that ride where it spins around and you have to stand against the side and the center falls out .
and i ...
damn it .
pardon me .
ahh !
this is just so far from the way i imagined the evening going .
it' s perfectly all right .
right , mickey ?
perfectly all right .
shall we ?
have a nice dinner .
i' il just be out here scrubbing .
hey , steve .
good to see you , mr. hamilton .
good to see you , larry .
hey , man , how are you ?
what' s up ?
hey .
this way .
doesn' t it hurt , smiling like that all the time ?
you get used to it .
should i do it ?
yeah .
you might not be able to hold it long , but go for it .
sure i will .
see that ?
it sort of gets you right there .
that' s horrible .
i told you .
you sure do have a lot of stuff .
yeah , sorry .
i' m never out of touch with the people who torment me .
who are they ?
agents , managers , people like that .
this man , jimmy lng , who' s making this movie im exactly right for but , for whatever reason , he' s taking a breath .
a what ?
he' s thinking it over .
it' s just all very competitive , this business , that' s all .
everybody seems to be chasing the same thing .
the same parts in the same movies , the same awards , the same big money .
well , im sure you have too much common sense to get caught up in all that .
i mean , it' s just a recipe for an unsatisfying life .
obviously you have your priorities straight , so ...
so , rosalee , what do you do ?
i work in a piggly wiggly .
im sorry ?
a supermarket .
i bag and check .
cool .
yeah .
it' s a real dream come true .
but it' s fun .
my two best friends work there .
so , what do you do , tad ?
oops .
what i mean is , what do you do when you' re not doing what you do ?
not a lot , you know .
there' s not a lot of time left for hobbies , really .
and i don' t really like watching sports , so i read .
play with my dog , my cat , my bird , you know .
i ...
i love animals , you know ?
what do you think they' re doing right now ?
i bet they' re in her hotel room , straining for breath .
his manhood yearning to be free .
her hands running over the ripples in his abdomen .
her perfect bosom crying out in ecstasy .
great .
all righty .
i had one of those .
a retainer ?
yeah , on the lowers and a night brace for the uppers .
i had really bad teeth as a kid .
yeah , im sure you were a real ugly duckling .
i was like anybody else .
a little gawky , unsure who i was .
combination skin .
well , you came together nicely .
thank you .
so did you .
bon appetit !
umm hmm !
thanks , mickey .
oh , wow .
this is beautiful .
these people sure leave a lot of lights on .
it' s beautiful .
it is .
and you , if i may say so , are also very beautiful .
how would you like to come back to my house for a little bit ?
sure .
for a little bit .
shake a doo ?
no , shake a doo .
good .
miss ramirez .
sonja .
anybody in the casa ?
i think we' re all alone .
oh !
do you want to come in a little further ?
um , you know what , tad , thank you , but i think i should get back to the hotel .
wow .
ok .
i don' t want the concierge to worry , you know .
good for you .
good for you .
i' il take you home .
you don' t have to do that .
you' re already here .
no , it would be my pleasure .
ok , thanks .
that' s really nice .
rosalee , it' s been wonderful to meet you .
i wish you only good things in life .
and to me , wonderfulness , too .
and to you , only the self same good wishes .
you know what im saying ?
yeah , of course .
thanks for the best night of my life .
no , thank you .
may i give you a kiss goodbye ?
i think you might maybe may .
good evening .
thank you .
good night , rosalee .
sweet dreams .
god !
the limo door swung open .
my foot hit the ground and i turned to take one last look at tad .
at those eyes , at that smile .
and then , regretfully , i headed back for the hotel .
please tell me we' re done now .
we' re done .
wow .
i cannot remember a time before you started telling that story .
peter , i was asked to provide a detailed description of the evening .
and you did .
actually , rosie , you did a great job .
i felt like i was there .
sort of against my will , but i did .
ok , guys , with your permission ,
i think we should all now return to our normal lives .
ok .
actually ...
rosie , i kind of had something that i wanted to ask you .
rosie .
whatever .
it' s something that i think you' re going to like .
i hope you' re going to like .
something i really hope you' re going to like .
it' s been a long time coming , so it might be kind of a surprise .
or not , or maybe not .
i don' t know .
i' m like ...
look , ok , what im trying to say is that
i ...
hey .
let me ask you , what would be the absolute worst thing that could happen to me right now ?
hi .
hi .
i' m tad .
this is my cathy friend .
and my pete friend .
im tad .
it' s quite pleased and pleasant to ...
i' ve heard a lot about you both .
have you ?
yeah .
so what are you doing here ?
i came to see you .
no way .
you' re just ...
that' s just ...
yeah .
no .
yeah .
you can' t ...
here ?
it' s true .
you mean your normal business itinerary does not include fraziers bottom ?
no .
ok , cathy .
am i too late to take you to lunch ?
no .
great .
shall we ?
yeah .
if that' s ok , pete .
well , actually ...
if that' s ok .
it' s ok .
if you' re going back to the airport i' il ride with you .
by the route 73 cloverleaf , i' il have given myself to you in ways you have only read about in the drugstore .
it was great to meet you .
you , too .
was there something that you wanted to tell me ?
it was nothing .
ok .
wow .
nice car .
thanks .
i asked the manager for a rental convertible and he gave me his wife' s car .
really ?
and that was the last time we ever saw her .
cathy , he' s not her type .
no .
rich , famous , handsome , ass like cement .
you are absolutely right .
move these cheeseburgers .
here you go , sweetpea .
oh , my gosh .
here you go , rosie .
thanks .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
i still can' t believe you' re here .
it was something i had to do .
sure .
fly clear across the country to have lunch at the fraziers bottom diner .
i couldn' t let that night be the last time i saw you .
can i just stop you and remind you of one thing ?
what' s that ?
im nobody .
rosalee , nobody is nobody .
fine .
im following my gut .
sometimes you have to do that , even if what you' re doing seems crazy .
because in the gap between what prudence says we should do and what our heart tells us we must do , well , rosie , therein lies our humanity .
that' s from the road to el dorado .
you really are a big fan , aren' t you ?
is that how you get women ?
you steal lines from your own movies ?
not anymore .
wow .
i hope not .
that would shoot a hole in your credibility .
rosie , the truth is that when we went on our date you said something that resonated with me .
you said you were sure i had my priorities straight .
but here' s the thing .
i don' t .
i really don' t .
my entire life has been about becoming successful , famous , becoming this thing that i am .
and you were right , it really is unsatisfying .
i need a positive influence , somebody with solid and substantial qualities , somebody who seems to understand life and how to live it in a good and happy way , like you .
i just want to be around you .
i want some of that goodness to rub off on me .
do you mean goodness in a romantic way ?
no , a platonic goodness .
and i mean that very seriously .
no funny business here .
did i say something wrong ?
no .
no , no , no .
no .
so , are you going to be in fraziers bottom for a while , then ?
i think i have to .
if im going to reset my priorities , i got to get out of la .
i got to get out of that fishbowl .
so , what do you say ?
i say , yikes a bee .
what does that mean ?
it' s just something my dad and i say when life surprises you and there' s nowhere to go but forward .
is that like " yes " ?
yes .
yes .
thanks for lunch .
i' il see you at seven , then .
see you at seven .
ok .
ok .
stop .
seriously .
you go , girl .
you get your man .
it' s room eight .
just go down to the door marked eight .
all right .
it' s just past seven .
if you hit nine , you' ve gone too far .
got you .
no phone calls , please .
all right .
thank you .
have a great night .
you , too .
i' il see you tomorrow .
very good .
00 .
ok .
he wants your goodness to rub off on him .
i know , right ?
i see .
and you actually believe this ?
why wouldn' t l ?
wow , rosie .
there' s innocent , there' s childlike , and then there' s just asking for it .
he wants your goodness to rub off on him ?
he wants your ass to rub off on him is more like it .
oh , my god .
yeah .
whatever .
you can' t go out with him tonight .
what do you mean i can' t ?
i mean that i need you to stay for the late shift .
janine' s sick .
yeah , she' s got a cough .
she does not .
no , not yet , but she will .
she' s definitely coming down with something .
no , she' s not .
janine , cough for me .
cough for me .
see ?
god , it' s all in your lungs .
what is ?
nothing .
you' re fine .
no , you' re not .
do not tell my employees when they are fine .
she' s fine .
even if she weren' t , you' d have to find somebody else because i am going out with tad hamilton .
stop that .
i did feel something in my lungs .
you' re not getting off tonight , janine .
bob , not now .
everywhere inn .
yeah .
do you guys have any other rooms ?
or how about suites ?
well , yeah , we got sweets .
we got some lollies here by the register if you want to come on by and get yourself a lolly .
no , i mean maybe something a little bigger or newer ?
bigger and newer ?
yes , i understand what you mean .
and no , we don' t have suites like that .
ok , i guess that' s cool .
that' s cool , i guess .
can you hold on a second ?
yes , sir .
hello .
hi , big guy .
where are you ?
i' m at a motel in fraziers bottom , west virginia .
ok .
words i never heard anyone utter .
she' s special , richard .
who ?
the girl from the charity thing .
the win a date girl ?
you flew to a place actually called fraziers bottom , west virginia , and are staying in a motel in order to nail the win a date girl ?
whoa , whoa , whoa .
i don' t want to nail her .
please don' t put it in those terms .
oh , forgive me , lord byron .
i want to be around her , you know ?
she has a goodness .
there' s a lot that i can learn from her .
i' m trying to feed my soul , ok ?
im trying to find a way to be happy .
you want to be happy now ?
this is big for me , richard .
oh , god .
this is a turning point for me .
you think that today .
but by the end of the week , when you' ve nailed her , you' re going to feel differently .
and what do you suppose happens then ?
i don' t ...
i will tell you what happens then .
you pulverize her heart , and then the press finds out and all the good that was done by the promotion gets washed away .
and jimmy lng continues breathing .
people like you can' t have relationships with girls from montana .
west virginia .
whatever .
why not ?
you' re too different .
your values are different .
for example , she has them .
no , this can work .
it can' t and when it ends , it' s very bad for business .
there are more important things than business .
i don' t even know who im talking to now .
hello ?
is this tad ?
what have you done with tad ?
i got to go , ok ?
no , you do not got to go .
you' re going through some kind of a phase .
an extreme version of your normal in between jobs insanity .
and it has a hold of you .
you need to come back to la , have a bushmills and a percocet , go out with an actress
looking to advance her career and end this self destructive behavior .
i' il talk to you soon .
no , tad .
bad tad .
bye , richard .
don' t hang up on me .
owww !
hello ?
yes , mr. hamilton .
i am here , sir .
you wouldn' t happen to have a masseuse on staff ?
no , but i am a very fast learner , and i could , you know ...
hello ?
it always comes around
coming .
you must be tad .
must be .
you are tad .
i know what you look like .
nice to meet you , mr. futch .
henry , for god' s sake .
please , come in .
thank you .
rosie' il be down in a minute .
ok , great .
may i offer you a chocolate martini ?
wow , look at that .
i hear they' re very big out your way .
yeah ?
yeah , i guess they are .
i' m driving , so ...
attaboy .
have a seat .
so , it looks like emperor' s new clothes will top $100 mill in domestic bo .
yeah .
and quantum studios , i think they' re looking to vertically integrate , either by buying a web or a weblet .
could be .
yes .
yeah .
hey .
hi .
i see you' ve met dad .
yeah .
we' ve been talking shop .
so what do you want to do tonight ?
do you guys have a movie theater ?
the warner .
it' s part of the loews family of theaters .
have you seen king arthur of britain ? " ve been wanting to .
you two enjoy yourselves .
have her back by dawn .
and no cocaine .
no , sir .
how was l ?
you were great , daddy .
good night .
bye bye .
im telling you , that' s him .
oh , yeah .
mom , i swear it' s him .
you think so ?
yes , it' s tad hamilton .
you look so sad there .
give me a break .
i' d just lost my wife and my goat .
next week , on a very special paramedic rescue ...
and what were your respective ages ?
i was 12 and she was 30 .
did your mother know ?
yeah .
hasta el proximo miercoles .
ahora disponsible en viernes in super mercado .
so , what do people do at this point in the evening in fraziers bottom ?
well , they go to the diner .
we could do that .
we haven' t eaten anything in almost , what , 15 minutes .
or they go home .
it is a school night .
of course , if it were a date , we might go to the watergap overlook .
and what do people do there ?
they park .
and then ?
and then they marvel at what a feat of engineering the gap is .
but this isn' t a date .
we can' t do that .
no .
no .
i don' t want to do anything to harm the friendship .
me neither .
over two trillion tons of water pass through the gap every hour .
that' s enough water to float a battleship .
or put out every fire in west virginia .
no kidding .
uh oh .
excuse me .
huh .
hello .
hi , mr. futch .
it' s pete .
hiya , pete .
rosie' s not here .
she' s out with tad hamilton .
really ?
i hadn' t ...
ok , cool .
good for her , then .
he seems like a very nice guy .
he does .
a lovely , lovely guy .
so , like , where did they go ?
the movies .
the movies .
ok .
it looks like the seven o' clock would get out at 8 . 45 , 8 . 50 ... or so someone happened to just mention to me in passing .
so i guess that would put them out and about and onto their next activity .
i guess it would , pete .
i' il leave rosie a note that you called .
yeah , i just had a little inventory question .
a little dairy case query .
but we can clear that up tomorrow .
ok , pete .
goodbye .
all right .
rosie ...
could i see your driver' s license and regis ...
yikes a bee .
hello , officer .
rosalee ?
hi , tom .
hi .
wow .
oh , boy .
ok , then .
we heard you were in town , mr. hamilton .
did you ?
pretty fond of our rosalee there , huh ?
yes .
yes , i am , officer .
tom ?
right , right , listen .
we got a call saying that there was someone parked here and you know it' s illegal after sunset , so ...
you got a call at this hour ?
yeah .
from who , a raccoon ?
never mind .
i am going to kill pete , bring him back to life and then kill him again .
calm down .
calm down .
why aren' t you upset ?
because it doesn' t matter .
ok ?
what happened here tonight was a force of nature .
two people set out to be friends , but nature would have none of it .
nature wanted them to be more .
and nature is going to want that tomorrow .
what did i tell you ?
what did i tell you about your carnal treasure ?
you said to guard it .
i said , guard it .
and what did you do ?
you practically chucked it at him .
you' re acting like it was a sleazy night .
it wasn' t .
it was classy .
it' s not like he took you to the movies and then felt you up in his car .
the evening evolved , pete .
my god , did he actually say that ?
it started as two friends going to the movies ...
and it evolved into dry humping .
he fought it .
he didn' t want to do anything that might wreck the friendship .
wow .
did he actually ...
i can' t believe he used that line .
and i can' t believe you bought it .
it' s not a line .
ok , fellas , a show of hands .
who here has used some form of the " don' t want to harm the friendship " line ?
father newell ?
well , prior to my enfrockment .
rosie , what are tad' s pectorals like to the touch ?
are they warm yet firm like ...
cath , that' s really not helping now .
sorry , got caught up .
thanks .
listen , rosie , just ...
listen to me , bottom line .
tad hamilton is an actor , ok ?
how do you know that he' s not acting with you ?
he' s not acting .
no .
he is .
he' s playing a role .
the role of hollywood bad boy trying to find virtue .
ok , after you guys have ...
after you guys have been together a couple of times he' s out of here , ok ?
you will never see him again .
hey , rosie , guess what ?
i bought a house .
i bought a house .
can you believe it ?
can you believe it ?
it' s actually a farm with a house and a silo for my wheat .
really ?
you bought a house .
i bought a house .

it' s good .

he' s going to stay in the motel while he fixes up the farm .
he' s a farmer all of a sudden ?
i think he' il be a good farmer .
he' s from malibu , california .
the only thing they grow there are breasts .
could you smile a little bit ?
this means nothing .
you are unbelievable .
what ?
rosie , people like this buy houses all the time .
it' s called a tax shelter .
peter .
i can guarantee you that by the end of today
tad' s farm and his house and his fricking wheat will be right back on the market .
why ?
what are you going to do ?
nothing .
you know , just be a good neighbor .
howdy .
tad , this place is unbelievable .
thanks , little lady .
this barn sits on what they call " the south 40 .
yeah .
im not sure exactly how many acres that is , but
i' m going to guess that' s a lot .
i' m going to guess 40 .
oh , yeah .
could be .
tad , being a new farm owner and all ,
i know you' il probably get some people to run this place for you , but ... hell , i' d be happy to show you a couple of everyday farm chores .
really ?
pete , that would be great .
thank you .
tad , that' s not a problem .
what you' re going to do here is grab on to one of the ... essentially one of the nipples , and just pull it firmly but gently towards the pail .
you' re going to freak out a ...
mmm , look at all that creamy milk .
that a girl , arleen .
that a girl .
you are making old tad thirsty .
where' d you learn to do that ?
pete , you remember my remake of the grapes of wrath ?
ok , so , the trick is to take a full swing so as to split the log in one swift ... stroke .
ok .
yeah .
let' s do this .
so , you work out ?
no .
yeah , me neither .
i know , it' s like ...
me neither .
ok .
it' s just basically one swift stroke .
ok .
and sometimes , basically , you get a bad piece of wood .
basically .
and sometimes you don' t .
that' s good .
beginner' s luck .
first time' s the charm .
and the luck continues .
that' s great for you , man .
did you ever see a movie i did called a man named jackson ?
if it came out , tad , then i saw it .
i think the ax is actually broken .
you got it .
good .
get someone else to cry , because i don' t cry .
i don' t do that .
which is why i try to stay away from melodramas .
oh , my god .
i finally did it .
people , are you watching this ?
rosie .
pete .
hey , tad .
hey .
can i talk to you for a sec ?
yeah , sure .
forgive the intrusion , but ...
no , no .
please , fire away .
ok .
here it is .
you win , ok ?
fair and square .
you win .
thank you .
you did have an advantage or two going in , but ...
excuse me , we' re in the middle of something here .
yeah , no problem .
i want rosie to be happy .
so , i got to ask you a couple of questions .
do you know how long she keeps her hair in straight or in curly mode ?
what ?
or why her favorite necklace has a starfish clasp ?
no .
do you even know that she has six different smiles ?
she has six smiles ?
yeah .
one when something flat out makes her laugh .
one when she' s laughing out of politeness .
but there' s one when she makes plans .
one when she makes fun of herself .
one when she' s uncomfortable .
and one when ...
one when she' s talking about her friends .
i don' t know those things yet , pete .
no , you don' t , tad .
i' m telling you , she is more of ... a treasure than you can possibly know .
she' s not just some wholesome small town girl , some good for you breath of fresh air .
tad , she is a wonderful person with a huge heart .
yeah .
and the kind of beauty that a guy only sees once , you know ?
once .
listen , tad , if there is even a chance that you could break her heart , please , just , for her sake ... walk away , man .
i could never break rosalee' s heart .
ok ?
good .
because if you do , i swear to god ,
i will tear you to pieces with my bare hands .
or vicious rhetoric .
you' re a good guy , pete .
but it' s apparently not good enough .
do you mind if i ...
yeah , no .
my bad .
finish up in here .
im sorry .
you' re a good kisser .
but i guess it doesn' t come as a shock to you to hear that .
you' re a really good kisser .
even compared to hollywood girls ?
mm hmm .
that' s just ridiculous .
oh , tad hamilton .
your favorite people are here .
you got to be kidding me .
who is it ?
guess who ?
it' s my agent and my manager .
taddy ?
tadala .
this is a nightmare .
housekeeping .
let us in .
hey , tad .
i' d like to apologize for ...
open zee zleibenshlocken .
come on .
you' re not going to be punk' d .
fellas .
tad edward hamilton .
howdy , little lady .
hi .
my manager , richard levy and my agent , richard levy .
you' re both named richard levy ?
who isn' t ?
you .
you must be rosalee .
yes .
did we come at a bad time ?
i hope so .
actually , yes .
well , tad .
jimmy lng stopped breathing .
what ?
you got the part , pal .
seems he saw something that reminded him that he had to have you .
it was the body of your work .
i knew it .
your credits .
the reality of you and who you are .
he called me and said , " who am i kidding ?
tad hamilton has to play this part .
there' s nobody else .
fellas , i have never felt better than i do at this moment .
except for that weekend in cabo .
that is exactly what i am talking about .
easy , " ve got a bad back .
that' s exactly what im talking about .
i told you a little good career news would put your head back on straight .
so then you' re leaving ?
yes .
fittings monday and rehearsals tuesday .
you' re back on the beam , pally .
boy , things happen fast .
oh , my god .
you' re right .
no , it' s fine .
im going to turn it down .
what ?
what ?
you are ?
i came here vowing to change my priorities and at the first opportunity im abandoning that .
you' re not going to turn down the part .
we both know that .
give us a minute , will you , fellas ?
we' il be in the lobby .
i wonder if they have a masseuse on staff .
i want you to go with me .
what ?
what ?
she absolutely cannot go with him .
i won' t take the part unless you come me .
although we could work something out .
really ?
yes , really .
rosie , have you been listening to anything " ve been telling you ?
i love you .
how many times in your life have you said that ?
not counting the movies ?
not counting .
i' ve said it a few times .
but ...
but i never knew what it meant .
i can' t go with you , tad .
because you don' t love me .
you maybe want to love me , but i think what you love right now is the idea of me .
you can' t love someone for what they stand for or seem to be .
you have to love them for their details , for the things that are true of them and only them .
i do love you for your details , rosie .
you don' t .
you couldn' t possibly .
you don' t even know what they are .
you have six smiles .
what ?
you have six smiles .
did you know that ?
one when something really makes you laugh .
and one when you' re just laughing out of politeness .
one when you' re making plans and one when you' re making fun of yourself .
one when you' re uncomfortable and one when ...
one when you' re talking about your friends .
how many is that ?
like 50 .
i told you .
i told you .
that is so much better than any speech from any of your movies .
i had a better writer .
so ...
will you go ?
yes .
he' s going back to cali , to cali , to cali .
what are you thinking ?
nothing .
im done thinking .
if im making a huge mistake , i don' t want to know .
you' re not making a mistake .
you know , as a bartender you do learn to kind of recognize those customers who need to talk .
angelica , im fine .
but could i have , like , six more of these ?
no , pete .
you really need to talk .
ok .
i think that our friend rosie ... might be falling in love with tad hamilton .
yeah , didn' t have to be a bartender to see that one coming .
right , but the problem with that is ... that im in love with rosie .
you know , i always thought that maybe you were .
so how much do you love her ?
is it love , is it big love or is it great love ?
what do you mean ?
love you get over in two months .
big love , two years .
and great love ...
yeah ?
great love changes your life .
oh , my god .
it' s great love .
lsn' t that great ?
you got to win her back .
angelica , trust me , i have tried everything .
what did she say when you told her that you love her ?
well , actually , maybe not everything , but ...
what did she say when you kissed her ?
ok , maybe it' s more like two things i haven' t tried .
well , what have you tried ?
i have very unsubtly implied how i feel about her .
ok , get up .
what ?
get your ass off the barstool .
angelica .
hey , if you feel it and you don' t do everything in your power to reach for it you are basically slapping life in the face .
i hate to break it to you , but i don' t stand a chance here , ok ?
honey , your odds go up when you file an application .
sure , but im up against ...
tad hamilton .
you are tad hamilton .
what ?
don' t you see ?
everybody' s tad hamilton to somebody , pete .
rosalee' s tad hamilton to you .
and you' re tad hamilton to me .
angelica , thank you .
so start acting like it .
ok .
yeah , ok .
you are a really good bartender .
hi .
hey .
come in , come in .
i have something to talk to you about .
me , too .
really ?
you go first .
no , you go first .
no .
seriously , you go first .
ok .
tad got a part in this huge movie and he asked me to go with him to california for the shoot .
we leave tomorrow afternoon .
lsn' t that great ?
i probably should' ve gone first .
why ?
what were you going to say ?
it' s nothing .
it was nothing .
just , you know , travel safely , ok ?
and just really enjoy the shoot .
actually , no , i remember what i was going to say .
i love you , rosie .
i always have .
if " ve been a jerk this last week , it' s because i have been fighting .
i have been fighting for you .
i don' t want to lose you to tad hamilton or anyone else .
you' re the one .
so , any reaction to any of this ?
because now would be an excellent time .
now ?
you kiss me now ?
you say this to me now , after 22 years of being my friend ?
yes , to all questions .
i' m ...
i have to pack .
you' re telling me that you can' t answer the most important question i' il ever ask in my entire life because you have to pack ?
not only do i have to pack , but i have a load of whites in the dryer , and my dad called my relatives from san clemente and they' re expecting me , so .. it' s all in the works .
but this is ...
rosie , what' s in your heart ?
i' m sorry .
i' m sorry , too .
you ok , pete ?
yes , sir .
listen , pete , obviously we' ve all been a little seduced by tad hamilton' s presence .
no one more so than me .
but that doesn' t mean i don' t know who cares about my daughter the most and who she would be with if the world were fair .
well , it' s not .
no .
no , it' s not .
when i was your age i was completely in love with eleanor hershey .
of the chocolate hersheys ?
the hershey chocolates ?
she was a great girl , completely unpretentious .
i actually met her filling her cadillac up with gas .
anyway , there was this french guy .
he was really rich .
he owned , like , france .
i didn' t stand a chance .
it happens that way sometimes .
it shouldn' t , but it does .
sometimes goliath kicks the shit out of david .
it' s just nobody bothers to tell that story .
well , thanks , mr. futch .
i feel much better now .
goodbye , mr. futch .
take it easy , pete .
are you sure you know what you' re doing ?
no .
ever feel more confused or alone ?
no .
have a nice flight .
so , we' il see you after principal photography .
yes , daddy .
you guys don' t mind not flying with us ?
we need our privacy .
that' s fine .
yeah .
we look forward to our shit ass commercial flight .
i always wanted a layover in cincinnati .
we will be absolutely fine .
another one in chicago .
so we' il be in la by april ?
we' il be fine .
it' s time .
ok .
safe trip , tad .
bye , honey .
welcome aboard , mr. hamilton .

miss ?
thank you .

what' s the matter with you ?
come on .
commercial isn' t so bad .
there' s got to be room for one more .
will you pull yourself together ?
thank you .
would you like a vicodin ?
jimmy , being in your movie is a privilege .
in fact , it' s more than a privilege .
it' s a real privilege .
can i ...
do you mind if i call you back in a few minutes ?
ok , thank you , sir .
you ok ?
mm hmm .
i' m just a little nervous for some reason .
i have a little nervous feeling in my ... self .
but that' s only natural , right ?
yeah .
this is a pretty huge thing im doing .
kind of a great leap of faith .
but i have that faith in you .
so im fine .
it' s going to be great .
good .
can' t you tell by my smile ?
which one is it ?
what ?
what number smile is it ?
it' s ...
wait , it was one .
no , one was when something really made me laugh .
right ?
one and a half .
rosie ...
i didn' t know about your six smiles .
pete told me about them .
he made me swear i wasn' t going to break your heart , or he would tear me to pieces , either with his bare hands or his rhetoric .
i stole the speech from pete to get you to come here with me .
i lied .
and im sorry .
and i know you' re going to be very upset .
i just ...
pete told you about the six smiles ?
yeah .
and made you swear that you wouldn' t break my heart ?
or he' d tear you to pieces , with either his bare hands or his rhetoric ?
yeah .
that is just so ...
adorable .
what ?
do you think it' s possible to love someone your whole life and never really realize it until something happens that makes you see ?
what' s that from ?
no , it' s not from anything .
i' m just saying it to you .
wow .
man , what a week .
fell in love for the first time , got my heart broken for the first time , was honorable for the first time .
got bit in the ass for being honorable for the first time .
bought a farm .
i' m sorry about the broken heart part .
do you think you could take me home now ?
yeah .
thank you .
cathy .
rosie ?
where' s pete ?
he' s not here .
what are you doing ?
what do you mean ?
he' s always here .
he' s pete .
no .
he didn' t come in today .
can i borrow your car ?
yes .
thank you .
pete .
pete .
not pete .
wow .
i' m just here because pete asked me to box up some stuff .
why ?
where' s he going ?
richmond .
and he isn' t going .
he' s gone .
he' s gone to richmond ?
why ?
i cannot believe i am taking my work home with me .
when great love is rejected , rosalee , something inside a man dies .
so all he can do is run away , where he can meet the girl he' il love second most .
unless ...
unless what ?
unless you can get to him before he closes the book on you .
but once it' s closed , it' s closed .
it' s finished .
it' s gone , dead .
it' s crushed .
it' s beaten .
it' s buried .
it is lost for all of time in a sea ...
angelica .
ok , yeah .
i owe you .
go .
if you' ve been dumped , give us a call on late night talk .
let' s go to line one .
scott , you' re on ...
what ?
pass me .
pete .
pete .
are you ok ?
yeah .
no ...
no , i meant to do that .
you have five smiles , pete .
one when you think someone' s an idiot .
one when you think someone' s really an idiot .
one when you' re getting all dressed up .
one when you' re singing barry white .
and one ... when you' re looking at me .
for all you lovers out there , this one' s for you .
i can' t believe im going to say this , but ...
would you like to dance ?
