look at that !
i' ve never seen anything like that in my life !
that' s incredible !
that' s terrific .
specifically , you' re bargaining for the right to stay in a horrible social spectacle .
it has its purposes .
you' ve served those purposes brilliantly .
why argue when you can quit ?
and you say you want to know why decisions are made .
your future comfort is assured .
you don' t need to know .
why argue about decisions you' re not powerful enough to make for yourself ?
energy will treat you well , you know that .
if the rule changes stay , mr bartholomew , i' m playin ' with my team .
too late .
the rule change is scheduled and announced .
there' s no going back .
you' ve seen to that .
i' il see you in tokyo .
you can be made to quit !
you can be forced !
you can' t make me quit !
don' t tell me i can' t .
don' t ever say that !
i can !
you can be stopped !
you could have killed someone !
it' s all goin ' too fast .
i' m not packed ...
you' re not going , daph .
those bags are ready .
here .
take this extra hat .
sir , i' ve had a call .
i have to go over to energy .
you can' t go to tokyo ?
what do you mean , i' m not going ?
i hope this isn' t an inconvenience .
no , no , it' s no problem .
i' m supposed to go with you .
well , what' s that mean ?
who told you you' re supposed to go with me ?
nobody told me .
listen , jonathan , i really wanna go with you .
i do really .
you' il need me .
get yourself another assignment , will you , daph ?
everybody' s an assignment .
life' s an assignment .
you better do as you' re told , jonathan .
that' s all i have to say .
are you threatenin ' me ?
don' t be here when i come back .
you won' t be back , johnny boy ...
don' t try to frighten me , daphne , you don' t know how .
you go tell them people that i' m going to tokyo and you' re not , huh ?
you tell ' em that .
ciao !
keller .
make sure my gear gets to the track in tokyo .
i' m gonna travel with the team this trip .
you call transportation and tell ' em .
yes , sir .
what chance does houston have of defeating tokyo tonight ?
both teams have fine players and different styles .
what do you say , moonpie ?
it' s not an even match , see , because the tokyo team has all these little short guys !
what about the rule changes ?
well , at houston , we kinda play a wide open system .
will you comment on a game where the rules are always changing ?
the game' s always had rule changes .
they don' t affect good teams .
you' re a great new player .
what' s the secret of your success ?
oh , it' s no secret .
i just imitate him and plastic surgery keeps me beautiful .
there are rumours that the last game of the season will be without time limits .
any comments ?
i don' t think it will .
it' s still a game .
there are also other rumours .
some say you retired from the game .
here i am .
corporate society was an inevitable destiny , a material dream world .
everything man touched became attainable .
i' ve been touched all my life , one way or the other .
either caressed or hit .
don' t much seem to matter which any more .
i guess that' s why i wanna see ella again .
to see if i still feel things now .
you know what i mean ?
yeah ...
there are some other things , too .
they took ella away from me .
now they' re tryin ' to push me out .
i' d sure like to find out why .
i think i' il go to one of them computer centres .
see what i can find out .
findin ' out things , that' s ...
that' s the thing , moonpie .
welcome to tokyo and tonight' s dramatic semifinal match for the world' s rollerball championship between hosts tokyo and houston .

houston being pressured by the faster tokyo team .
the second ball is fired .

this way , please .
may i say first , please , that you played a superb game in our city .
thank you .
a simple problem , yet i know it is difficult for you .
your team mate has no family and permission is required now before consummating matters .
so , he' s technically dead ?
yes , unfortunately .
his heart and lungs will function , but his brain is ...
it has expired .
from the first minutes , it was hopeless .
i believe this was explained to you .
he' s warm .
yes .
but if you will , please , you must sign a release form .
it is required .
does he ...
does he dream ?
no , there is no brain wave at all , no sort of consciousness .
just a deep coma , a vegetable .
no dreams , nothing .
but even a plant feels somethin ' .
who can say ?
please .
it senses life .
i mean , it turns towards the sun .
it' s alive , isn' t it ?
you must sign .
you ...
you just leave him the way he is .
just leave him as he is .
you must sign .
there' s no other way .
arrangements will be made .
please !
there are hospital rules that ...
no , there aren' t .
there aren' t any rules at all .
let me know if you have any problems .
you won' t find any answers in geneva .
take care of your arm .
in my opinion we are confronted here with something of a situation .
otherwise i would not have presumed to take up your time .
once again it concerns the case of jonathan e.
we don' t want anything extraordinary to happen to jonathan .
we' ve already agreed on that .
no accidents , nothing unnatural .
the game was created to demonstrate the futility of individual effort .
let the game do its work .
the energy corporation has done all it can .
if a champion defeats the meaning for which the game was designed , then he must lose .
i hope you agree with my reasoning .
thank you all .
will you follow me , please ?
hello !
hello !
yes , it is !
the famous jonathan e. hard to believe !
sorry things are in a mess .
the rollerball champion .
wonderful !
not many people come to see us , you know .
we' re not easy to talk to , zero and i.
we' re a little confused again here today .
this is embarrassing .
it' s embarrassing to misplace things .
you' ve misplaced some data ?
mm , the whole of the 13 th century .
misplaced the computers several conventional computers .
we can' t find them .
we' re always moving things around , getting organised , my assistants and i.
but this is zero' s fault .
zero , he' s the world' s file cabinet .
pity .
poor old 13 th century .
well , come along now .
you want to get started , don' t you ?
yes , sir .
this way .
now ...
we' ve lost those computers with all of the 13 th century in them .
not much in the century just dante and a few corrupt popes .
but it' s so distracting and annoying .
you' ve unlimited restrictions here , of course , but you' il have to come so , so many times .
it all takes such effort .
do the executives still come here ?
oh , they used to , some of them .
what about the books ?
books , books ?
they' re all changed .
all transcribed .
all information is here .
we' ve zero , of course .
he' s the central brain , the world' s brain .
fluid mechanics , fluidics .
he' s liquid , you see .
his waters touch all knowledge .
everything we ask has become so complicated now .
each thing we ask ...
this morning we wanted to know about the 13 th century .
he flows out into all our storage systems .
he considers everything .
he' s become so ambiguous now , as if he knows nothing at all .
could you tell me about the corporate wars ?
wars , wars ?
oh , yes , of course , we have them all here .
punic war , prussian war , peloponnesian war .
crimean war , wars of the roses .
one doesn' t recall them in sequence , but corporate wars ...
well , zero will or can , i' m sure , tell you anything .
a memory pool , you see .
he' s supposed to tell us where things are and what they might possibly mean .
look , zero .
a visitor .
jonathan e , the rollerball champion .
you' ve filed away a lot of data on him .
do you remember ?
does it answer you ?
oh , yes , it speaks .
it finds things and loses them and confuses itself .
ask anything , he' il find it for you , section and lot .
won' t you , zero ?
all right .
i' d like ...
i' d like some information about corporate decisions .
how they' re made and who makes them .
zero , you heard the question .
answer him .
negative .
you don' t have to give him a full political briefing .
answer .
negative .
this is jonathan e.
he has to know .
make it simple .
answer .
corporate decisions are made by corporate executives .
corporate executives make ...
i know we have the answers .
knowledge converts to power .
energy equals genius .
power is knowledge .
i don' t want to bully you .
genius is energy .
corporate entities control elements ...
but you have to answer ! ... of economic life , technology , capital ,
labour and markets .
corporate decisions are made by ...
you have to , zero ! ... corporate executives .
the 13th century ...
negative , negative , negative ...
it' s so embarrassing !
hello , johnny .
how are you , ella ?
nervous .
how are you ?
i' m all right , i guess .
what are you doin ' ?
looking at you .
counting your scars .
seeing how you' ve changed .
oh , you mean that' s how i' ve changed ?
just a little more beat up .
oh , no !
you' re just not ...
yeah , well ...
come on .
you want a drink or somethin ' ?
no , thank you .
you have a lovely place .
thank you .
well , i' ve seen your house .
you have ?
yeah .
when we played in rome , i stood a block away and watched your front gate for a couple of hours .
i was just standin ' there wonderin ' what your furniture was like , what you said to each other in the mornings .
what' s he like ?
what' s he do , this ... ?
he' s a city engineer .
we have a jet copter , a son , two cats and a place in the alps .
you don' t really want to hear all of this .
a son , huh ?
yes .
we have a lot of friends .
and he has a lover .
we have furniture a lot like yours .
same taste in furniture .
how about that ?
you know , johnny , all they want is a kind of incidental control over just a part of our lives .
they have control economically and politically , but they also provide .
provide , huh ?
they were responsible for takin ' you away and i started to hate ' em .
but they weren' t .
it was the game , johnny .
i mean , it was so important to you .
it was as if i wasn' t even there .
the play , there was nothing else .
i' m sorry .
you know i wanted you here .
well , i mean ...
this might sound all wrong , but ...
well , i was just tryin ' to remember myself then .
yeah .
maybe it was love i wanted to try to remember .
there' s a lot of things i wanna talk to you about .
yeah .
i' ve been thinkin ' , ella .
thinkin ' a lot .
i' ve been watching .
it' s like people had a choice a long time ago between ... well , having all them nice things or freedom .
of course , they chose comfort .
but comfort is freedom .
it always has been .
the history of civilisation is the struggle against poverty .
no !
no , that' s not it .
that' s never been it .
i mean , them privileges just buy us off .
look ...
they want me to quit , ella .
then quit .
just like that , huh ?
but you' ve got to do it now .
you' ve got to before it' s too late , whether you want to or not .
look , johnny ...
the next game , there won' t be any substitutions allowed .
and no time limit .
you' il die , johnny .
everybody will die .
no time limit .
they tell you that ?
yes .
they tell you to convince me to quit ?
yes , but that isn' t why i came here .
you have to get out for your own sake .
please , johnny , please .
did they tell you to stay if i did quit ?
are you my big reward ?
you still don' t understand why i came here .
you' re the only person i ever wanted .
i wanted you on my side , that' s all .
it' s like you' re a god now .
maybe you know what i don' t .
i' ve been so stupid for so long .
i' ve been so stubborn .
i don' t even know why .
it scares me .
i know i' m probably gonna ...
i' m probably gonna die .
and you' il be in there pumpin ' away long after i' m gone .
hey , you ...
you got it made , old buddy .
bluebonnets and everything .
jonathan' s dead !
jonathan' s dead !
jonathan' s dead !
jonathan' s dead !
attention .
your attention , please .
rule changes for tonight' s world championship game .
no substitutions , no penalties and no time limit !
watch now , he' s got the ball .
next time around we defend .
come on !
come on , get outta there !
get him up .
he did it !
get him in the elevator .
get off the rail !
get him off the track !
i don' t want another man on that track !
houston , what the hell are you doing ?
ain' t nobody gonna win this game !
game !
this wasn' t meant to be a game !
never !
watch his leg .
easy , easy !
let me have him , let me have him .
let me have him !
move out .
move out !
