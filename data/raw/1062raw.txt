how long you been a smoker ?
i don' t know .
since i was about 13 .
thirteen .
let' s see , you' re about 19 , 20 ?
am i right ?
what in the hell is that ?
that' s your lung .
by this time , your lung looks like this .
you' ve gotta be shitting me .
you think i' m shitting you ?
here .
what' s this ?
a trach ring .
it' s what they install in your throat when cancer takes your voice box .
this one came out of a 60 year old man .
oh , god !
he smoked until the day he died .
used to put the cigarette in this and smoke that way .
excuse me , but
this is where you' re heading .
cruddy lung , smoking through a hole in your throat .
do you really want that ?
lf it' s already too late , i guess
no , it' s never too late .
put the cigarettes back , and try some gum instead .
here .
chewlies gum .
try this . it' s not the same .
it' s cheaper than cigarettes , and it certainly beats this .
oh , jesus ! it' s a picture of a cancer ridden lung .
keep it .
i' il just take the gum .
fifty five .
you made a very wise choice .
keep up the good work .
if you' re gonna drink that coffee , i think you oughta take it outside , huh ?
i think i' il drink it in here .
thanks .
if you' re gonna drink it in here , i' d appreciate it if you don' t bother the customers .
okay .
i' m sorry about that .
pack of cigarettes .
what' s that ?
this ?
how long you been smoking ?
<muslc> kill the drummer <muslc>
<muslc> kill the bass player kill both bass players <muslc>
<muslc> this song is the reason why i' m now going deaf <muslc><muslc>
let' s kick some ass !
yeah !
i feel good today , silent bob .
we' re gonna make some money .
and you know what we' re gonna do ?
we' re gonna go to that party and get some pussy .
i' m gonna fuck this bitch , i' m gonna fuck this bitch .
i' il fuck anything that moves !
what the fuck you lookin ' at ?
i' il kick your fuckin ' ass !

you' re cute as hell .
i could go down on you , suck you ,
line up three other guys , make like a circus seal .
hey , what' re you , a fucking faggot ?
i hate guys .
i love women !
what you want , grizzly adams ?
you' re spending what , 20 , maybe 30 dollars a week on your cigarettes ?
yeah .
forty .
fifty three .
fifty three dollars a week on cigarettes !
come on !
would you give somebody that much money each week to kill you ?
that' s what you' re doing now by paying for this so called privilege to smoke !
we' re gonna croak sometime .
it' s that mentality that allows the cancer producing industry to thrive .
of course we' re all gonna die someday !
do we have to pay for it ?
do we have to actually throw hard earned dollars down on the counter ... and say , " please , mr. merchant of death , sir , please ,
sell me something that will stink up my breath and clothes ,
and fry my lungs !
now , wait a second .
here comes the speech about how he' s just doing his job by following orders .
let me tell you about another group of hate mongers that were just following orders .
who' s that ?
they were called nazis !
yeah , that' s right .
friggin ' nazi .
they practically wiped an entire nation off the earth ,
like your cigarettes are doing now !
i think you' d oughta leave .
you want me to leave .
why ?
' cause somebody' s telling it like it is , giving these fine people a wake up call ?
yeah .
no , you' re loitering and causing a disturbance .
i' m a disturbance ?
you' re the disturbance , pal .
here , now i am a customer .
i' m gonna buy some chewlies gum .
i' m a customer engaged in a discussion with the other customers .
that' s right .
smoke my big fat cock !
he' s scared now ' cause he sees the threat we present .
he smells the change is coming !
you definitely are the source in this area , and we' re gonna shut you down for good !
for good , cancer merchant !
cancer merchant !
cancer merchant !
who' s leading this mob ?
that guy .
freeze !
let' s see some credentials .
slowly !
you' re a chewlies gum representative ?
chewlies ?
you' re stirring up anti smoking sentiment to , what , sell more gum ?
get out of here !
and you people don' t you have jobs to go to ?
get out of here .
go commute .
you oughta be ashamed of yourselves .
a bunch of easily led automatons .
try thinking for yourselves before you pelt an innocent man with cigarettes !
uh , pack of cigarettes ?
don' t you think you' re taking this a bit too hard ?
i have enough indignities in my life and people start throwing cigarettes at me .
at least they weren' t lit .
oh , i hate this fucking place .
then quit .
you should be going to school anyway .
please , veronica , at this point , the last thing i need is a lecture .
all i' m saying is , if you' re that unhappy , you should leave .
i' m not even supposed to be here today !
i know .
i stopped by your house .
your mom told me you left , like , at 6 : 00 or something .
the guy got sick .
he couldn' t come in .
don' t you have a hockey game at 2 : 00 ?
yes .
and i' m gonna play like shit because i didn' t have a good night' s sleep .
why' d you agree to come in then ?
hey , i' m only here until 12 : 00 .
after that , i' m gone .
the boss comes in .
why don' t you open the shutters ?
get some sunlight in here .
someone jammed gum in the locks .
you' re kidding .
bunch of savages in this town .
thanks .
how much money did you leave up there ?
like , three dollars in mixed change and a couple of singles .
this time in the morning , people just get a paper or coffee .
you' re trusting .
why do you say that ?
how do you know they' re taking the right amount of change or even paying for what they take ?
theoretically , people see money on the counter , no one around , they think they' re being watched .
honesty through paranoia .
why do you smell like shoe polish ?
i needed shoe polish to make that sign out there .
smell won' t come off .
you think anybody can see us down here ?
why , you wanna have sex or something ?
can we ?
really ?
i was kidding .
like you can' t get enough of me .
typically male point of view .
how do you figure ?
show some bedroom proficiency , you think you' re gods .
what about what we do for you ?
women as lovers are basically the same ; they just have to be there .
be there ?
making a male climax isn' t at all challenging .
insert somewhere close , preferably moist , thrust , repeat .
how flattering .
now , making a woman come , therein lies a challenge .
you think so ?
a woman makes a guy come , it' s standard .
a guy makes a woman come , it' s talent .
and i actually date you ?
something wrong ?
i' m insulted .
believe me , don juan , it takes more than that to get a guy off .
just being there , as you put it , is not enough .
hmm , i' ve touched a nerve .
i' m astonished to hear you you trivialize my role in our sex life .
it wasn' t directed at you .
i was making a broad generalization .
you' re making a generalization about broads .
those are my opinions based on the few women ... who were goodly enough to sleep with me .
how many ?
how many what ?
how many different girls have you slept with ?
didn' t we have this discussion once before ?
we might have .
i don' t remember .
how many ? including you ?
it better be up to and including me .
twelve .
you slept with 12 different girls ?
including you ?
yes .
ow !
what' d you do that for ?
you' re a pig !
why' d you hit me ?
do you know how many different men i' ve had sex with ?
do i get to hit you after you tell me ?
three .
three ?
three , including you .
you only slept with three different people ?
i' m not the pig you are .
who ?
you !
no , who are the three , besides me .
john francin and rob stanslik .
wow .
that' s why you should feel like a pig .
you men make me feel sick .
you' il sleep with anything that says yes .
animal , mineral or vegetable .
vegetable , meaning paraplegic .
they put up the least amount of struggle .
after dropping a bombshell like that , you owe me big .
name it .
i want you to come with me on monday .
where ?
to school .
there' s a seminar about getting back into a scholastic program ... after a lapse in enrollment .
can' t we ever have a discussion without that coming up ?
it' s important to me , dante .
you have so much potential that' s going to waste in this pit .
i wish you' d go back to school .
stop .
you' re making my head hurt .
shit !
why' re you getting up ?
unlike you , i have class in 45 minutes .
willam ?
hey , ronni .
how you been , man ?
what , do you work here now ?
no , i was visiting my man .
dante , this is willam black .
this is dante hicks , my boyfriend .
how you doing ?
just the soda ?
no , and a pack of cigarettes .
so where you been , man ?
still going to seton hall ?
no , i transferred into monmouth this year .
i was tired of missing him .
that' s beautiful , man .
so , you still talk to silvan ?
i just talked to her on monday .
we still hang out on weekends .
oh , that' s great .
well , you two lovebirds take it easy , okay ?
bye .
take it easy .
that was snowball .
why do you call him that ?
silvan made it up .
it' s a blow job thing .
what do you mean ?
after the blow job , he likes to have it spit back into his mouth while kissing .
it' s called snowballing .
he requests this ?
he gets off on it .
silvan can be talked into anything .
why do you say that ?
like you said , she snowballed him .
silvan ?
no , i snowballed him .
yeah , right .
i' m serious .
you sucked that guy' s dick ?
yeah .
how do you think i knew
you said you only had sex with three different guys !
you never mentioned him !
because i never had sex with him .
you sucked his dick !
we went out a few times .
we never had sex , but we fooled around .
oh , my god .
why did you tell me you only had sex with three guys ?
because i did only have sex with three guys . it doesn' t mean i didn' t just go with people .
oh , my god , i feel so nauseous !
i' m sorry , dante .
i thought you understood .
i did understand !
i understood that you had sex with three guys and that' s all you said !
please calm down .
how many ?
dante , let it go !
how many dicks have you sucked ?
shut up a second and i' il tell you .
jesus !
i didn' t freak out like this when you told me how many girls you fucked !
this is different .
this is important .
how many ?
well ?
something like 36 .
what ?
something like 36 ?
lower your voice .
what is that " something like 36 " ?
does that include me ?
uh ... 37 .
i' m 37 ?
i' m going to class .
oh , my god .
37 !
my girlfriend sucked 37 dicks ! in a row ?
where you going ?
hey , listen , jerk .
until today , you never even knew ... how many guys i slept with because you never even bothered to ask .
then you act all nonchalant about fucking 12 girls .
i never had sex with 12 guys !
no , but you sucked enough dick !
yeah , i went down on a few guys .
a few ?
one of those guys was you .
the last one , i might add .
which , if you' re too stupid to comprehend , means that i' ve been faithful to you since we met .
all the other guys i went with before i met you .
if you want to have a complex , go ahead .
but don' t look at me like i' m the town whore , because you were plenty busy before you met me .
why did you suck their dick ?
why couldn' t you sleep with them like any other decent person ?
because going down isn' t a big deal .
i used to like a guy , we' d make out , and sooner or later i' d go down on him .
but i only had sex with the guys i loved .
i feel sick .
i love you !
don' t feel sick .
every time i kiss you , i' m gonna taste 36 other guys .
i' m going to school .
maybe later you' il be a bit more rational .
i' m 37 !
i just can' t
good bye , dante !
hey , try not to suck any dick on the way through the parking lot !
hey !
hey , you !
get back here .
i thought that place was supposed to be open at 11 : 00 . it' s 11 : 20 .
i' ve already called his house twice .
he' il be here soon .
hey , it' s not like it' s a demanding job over there .
i' d like to get paid to sit on my ass and watch tv .
i walked in the other day , that son of a bitch was sleeping .
i' m sure he wasn' t sleeping .
are you calling me a liar ?
are you calling me a liar ?
no !
he was probably just resting his eyes .
what the hell is that , " resting his eyes " ?
like he' s some air traffic controller ?
actually , that' s his night job .
wise ass too , huh ?
go ahead .
keep cracking wise .
that' s why you' re jockeying a register in some fuckin ' convenience store ... instead of working at a steady job .
i' ve got no time to bullshit around , waiting for that son of a bitch .
make sure he gets that .
the number' s 812 .
my name' s wynarski .
i wanted a movie tonight .
if you tell me the title of the movie , he' il hold it for you .
don' t hurt yourself , buddy .
i' il go to big choice video instead .
you forgot your keys .
guy ain' t here yet .
you' re kidding ! it' s almost 11 : 30 .
i' ve been here since 11 : 00 .
i hate it when i can' t rent videos !
i would' ve went to big choice , but the tape i want is right there on that wall .
which one ?
dental school .
you came for that too ?
that' s the movie i came for .
i have first dibs .
says who ?
says me .
i' ve been here half an hour .
i' d call that first dibs .
ain' t gonna happen , my friend .
i' m getting that movie .
like hell you are .
i' il bet you 20 bucks you don' t get to rent that tape .
twenty bucks ?
twenty bucks .
all right , asshole .
you' re on .
you' re late .
what the hell are you doing here ?
the boss called .
arthur fell ill .
why are the shutters closed ?
someone jammed gum in the locks .
bunch of savages in this town .
that' s what i said .
if i' d known you were here , i' d have come even later .
what smells like shoe polish ?
go open the store .
hey , you see a set of keys around here ?
no time for love , dr. jones .
fucking kids .
some guy just came in refusing to pay late fees .
said the store was closed for two hours yesterday .
i tore up his membership .
shocking abuse of authority .
i' m a firm believer in the philosophy of a ruling class , especially since i rule .
want something to drink ?
i' m buying .
no , thanks .
who was on your phone this morning , like , 2 : 30 ?
i was trying to call for half an hour .
why ?
i wanted to use your car .
snack cake .
you don' t wanna know .
you call caitlin again ?
she called me .
you tell veronica ?
one fight a day with veronica is all i can stomach , thanks .
what do you fight about ?
we don' t fight about anything .
she wants me to leave here and go back to school and get some direction .
i bet the most frequent topic of arguments is caitlin bree .
you win .
i' m going to offer you some advice , my friend .
let the past be the past .
forget caitlin bree .
you been with veronica how long now ?
seven months .
chick' s nuts about you .
how long you date caitlin ?
five years .
chick only made you nuts , man .
she cheated on you how many times ?
eight and a half .
eight and a half ?
party at john kay' s , senior year ; i get blitzed , pass out in his bedroom .
caitlin comes in and jumps all over me .
so that' s cheating ?
no .
in the middle of it she called me brad .
she called you brad ?
that' s not cheating .
people say crazy shit during sex .
one time , i called this girl " mom .
i hit the light , she freaks .
she thought i was brad michelson .
what do you mean ?
she was supposed to meet brad in a dark bedroom .
she picked the wrong one .
she didn' t even know i was at the party .
oh , my god .
great story , huh ?
that girl was vile to you .
interesting postscript to that story .
do you know who wound up in that bedroom with brad ?
your mother ?
alan harris .
chess team alan harris ?
the two moved to idaho together .
they raise sheep .
that' s frightening .
takes different strokes to move the world .
in light of this lurid tale , i don' t see ... how you could romanticize your relationship with caitlin .
she broke your heart and inadvertently drove men to deviant lifestyles .
there was a lot of good in our relationship .
aside from the cheating , we were a great couple .
that' s what high school was about : algebra , bad lunch and infidelity .
you think things will be different this time ?
they are .
when she calls me now , she' s a different person .
she' s frightened , vulnerable .
she' s finishing college and about to enter the real world .
that' s scary for anyone .
shit , i gotta place an order .
talkin ' to myself here .
i' m listening .
she' s leaving college and  and she' s looking for support .
i think this is leading our relationship to a new level .
what about veronica ?
i think the arguments veronica and i are having are some kind of manifestation ... of a subconscious desire to break up with her , so i can pursue a more meaningful relationship with caitlin .
caitlin' s on the same wavelength ? it' s safe to say yes .
i think all four of you better sit down and talk it over .
all four ?
you , veronica , caitlin and caitlin' s fianc .
do you sell video tapes ?
yeah .
what are you looking for ?
happy scrappy hero pup .
uh , one second .
i' m on the phone with the distribution house .
let me make sure they got it .
what' s it called again ?
happy scrappy hero pup .
happy scrappy  she loves it .
obviously .
this is rst video calling .
customer number 4352 .
i' d like to place an order .
whispers in the wind , to each his own ,
put it where it doesn' t belong , my pipes need cleaning ,
all tit fucking , volume eight , i need your cock ,
ass worshipping rim jobbers , my cunt and eight shafts ,
cum clean , cum gargling naked sluts , cum buns ill ,
cumming in socks , cum on ilene ,
huge black cocks with pearly white cum ,
girls who crave cock , girls who crave cunt ,
the ky connection , pink pussy lips , oh , yeah , and , uh , all holes filled with hard cock .
yup .
oh , wait a minute .
what was that called again ?
<muslc> i' m a needle , you know <muslc>
<muslc> never want to be a haystack <muslc>
<muslc> don' t ever want to break your heart in two <muslc>
<muslc> know the crowd is gonna sell their soul <muslc>
<muslc> take it anywhere i know well , i promise you <muslc> <muslc> it' s making me sick <muslc><muslc>
yes , i' d like to check on a misprint in today' s edition .
today' s edition .
it says , " bree to wed asian design major .
no , everything' s spelled fine .
i was just wondering if the article was a misprint .
i don' t know , like a typographical error or something .
maybe it should say , " caitlin bray " or " caitlin bre " with one " e.
i' m a curious party .
a curious party .
i' m an ex boyfriend , and , well ,
i talk to her all the time and she never mentioned this engagement .
that' s why i' m thinking maybe it' s a misprint .
are you sure ?
maybe there' s a vindictive printer working for you .
meaning like , someone who asked her out once and got shot down , and this is his revenge by putting this bogus article in the paper when it went to press .
hello .
hello ?
i don' t care if she' s my cousin , i' m gonna knock those boots again tonight .
look who it is .
the fuckin ' human vacuum .
scumbag , what are you doing ?
just hanging with silent bob and his cousin .
he' s your cousin ?
he' s from russia too .
no way .
what part of russia ?
i don' t know .
do i look like his fuckin ' biographer ?
olaf , what part of russia are you from ?
moscow .
he only speaks russian ?
he speaks some english , but he cannot speak it good like we do .
is he staying here ?
nah , he' s moving to the big city this week .
he wants to be a metal singer .
no way .
i swear .
olaf , metal .
that' s his fucking metal face .
olaf , girl nice ?
that' s fucked up , man .
what did he say ?
i don' t know , man , but this guy' s a character .
he really wants to play metal ?
yeah , he' s got his own band in moscow . it' s called " fuck your yankee blue jeans " or something .
that doesn' t sound metal .
you gotta hear him sing .
olaf , " berserker .
come on , man , " berserker " !
does he sing in english or russian ?
in english .
come on , " berserker .
girls think sexy .
aah .
aah .
watch , he' s gonna sing it .
it' s too funny .
<muslc> my love for you is like a truck , berserker <muslc>
<muslc> would you like some making fuck , berserker <muslc>
that' s fuckin ' funny , man .
did he say , " making fuck " ?
<muslc> my love for you is ticking clock , berserker <muslc>
<muslc> would you like to suck my cock , berserker <muslc><muslc>
that' s beautiful , man .
hold on to the counter and i' il pull .
usually i just turn the can upside down .
maybe we oughta soap your hand up .
they oughta put a warning on these things , like they do with cigarettes .
i think it' s coming !
thanks .
i thought i was going to have to go to the hospital .
i' il throw this out as a precautionary measure .
stings a little .
sometimes you got to let those hard to reach chips go .
thanks .
you know , that article' s accurate .
caitlin really is getting married .
you know what i just watched ?
me pulling a can off some moron' s fist ?
return of the jedi .
didn' t you hear me ?
caitlin is really getting married .
jedi or the empire strikes back ?
empire .
blasphemy .
empire had the better ending .
i mean , luke gets his hand cut off , finds out vader' s his father .
han gets frozen , taken away by boba fett . it ends on such a down note .
i mean , that' s what life is : a series of down endings .
all jedi had was a bunch of muppets .
there was something else going on in jedi .
i never noticed it ' til today .
they build another death star , right ?
yeah .
the first one was completed and fully operational before the rebels destroyed it .
luke blew it up .
give credit where credit' s due .
the second one was still being built when they blew it up .
compliments of lando calrissian .
something just never sat right with me that second time around .
i could never put my finger on it , but something just wasn' t right .
and you figured it out .
the first death star was manned by the lmperial army .
the only people on board were storm troopers , dignitaries , lmperialists .
basically .
so when they blew it up , no problem .
evil' s punished .
and the second time around ? it wasn' t even done being built yet . it was still under construction .
so ?
a construction job of that magnitude would require ... a lot more manpower than the lmperial army had to offer .
i' il bet they brought independent contractors in on that thing .
plumbers , aluminum siders , roofers  not just lmperialists .
is that what you' re getting at ?
exactly .
to get it built quickly and quietly , they' d hire anybody that could do the job .
you think the average storm trooper knows how to install a toilet main ?
all they know is killing .
so they bring in independent contractors .
why are you so upset ?
those innocent contractors brought in are killed , casualties of a war they had nothing to do with .
look , you' re a roofer .
some juicy government contract comes your way .
you got a wife and kids , the two story in suburbia .
this is a government contract which means all sorts of benefits .
along come these left wing militants who blast everything ... within a three mile radius with their lasers .
you didn' t ask for that ; you had no personal politics .
you' re just trying to scrape out a living .
i don' t mean to interrupt ,
but what are you talking about ?
the ending of return of the jedi .
my friend is trying to convince me that independent contractors working on the death star ... were innocent victims when it was destroyed by the rebels .
i' m a contractor myself .
i' m a roofer .
done and ready home improvements .
speaking as a roofer , i can tell you a roofer' s personal politics ...
comes into play heavily when choosing jobs .
like when ?
three weeks ago , i was offered a job up in the hills .
beautiful house .
tons of property .
a simple re shingling job .
they told me if i could finish it in one day , i would double my price .
then i realized whose house it was .
whose house was it ?
dominic bambino' s .
baby face bambino ?
the gangster ?
the same !
the money was right , but the risk was too high .
i knew who he was , and based on that , i turned the job over to a friend .
based on personal politics .
right !
the next week , the foresie family put a hit on baby face' s house .
my friend was shot and killed .
didn' t even finish re shingling .
no way .
i' m alive because i knew the risk involved in that particular client .
my friend wasn' t so lucky .
any contractor working on that death star knew the risk involved .
if they got killed , it' s their own fault .
a roofer listens to this , not his wallet .
they say so much , but they never tell you if it' s any good .
are either one of these any good ?
sir ?
what ?
are either one of these any good ?
i don' t watch movies .
well , have you heard anything about either one of them ?
i find it' s best to stay out of other people' s affairs .
you mean you haven' t heard anybody say anything about either one of these ?
nope .
well , what about these two ?
they suck .
these are the same two movies .
you weren' t paying any attention .
no , i wasn' t .
i don' t think your manager would appreciate it
i don' t appreciate your ruse , ma' am .
i beg your pardon ?
your ruse .
your cunning attempt to trick me .
i was only pointing out that you weren' t paying any attention to what i was saying .
and i hope it feels good .
you hope what feels good ?
i hope it feels so good to be right .
there' s nothing more exhilarating ... than pointing out the shortcomings of others , is there ?
well , this is the last time i rent here !
you will be missed .
screw you !
hey , you' re not allowed to rent here anymore !
yeah !
screw me ?
you' il never believe what this unruly customer just said .
wait .
she in here ?
this guy' s going through all the eggs .
this has been going on for 20 minutes now .
what' s he looking for ?
said he has to find the perfect dozen .
perfect dozen ?
each egg has to be perfect .
the quest isn' t going well ?
obviously not .
look at all the cartons that didn' t make the grade .
why doesn' t he mix and match ?
i told him that , and he yelled at me .
what' d he say ?
he said it was important to have standards .
he says no one has any pride anymore .
it' s not like you laid the eggs yourself .
i give him five more minutes .
after that , i' m calling the cops .
i don' t need this .
i' m not even supposed to be here today .
two packs of cigarettes .
i' m as puzzled as you .
i' ve actually seen it before .
you know him ?
no , but i know the behavior .
let me guess .
he' s looking for the perfect carton of eggs ?
how' d you know ?
i' il bet you a million dollars he' s a guidance counselor .
why do you say that ?
i saw it happen in food city , like , last year .
different guy , though .
stock boy said he' d been looking through cartons of eggs for half an hour , doing all sorts of endurance tests and stuff .
i asked him why nobody ever called the manager , and he said it happens ... two , three times a week , sometimes more .
get out of here .
no , i kid you not .
they call it shell shock .
seems to only happen with guidance counselors .
they used to make a big deal of it , but they just let it go now ... because they always pay for whatever they break , and they never bother anybody .
why guidance counselors ?
if your job was as meaningless as theirs , wouldn' t you go crazy too ?
come to think of it , my guidance counselor was kinda worthless .
see ?
it' s important to have a job that makes a difference , boys .
that' s why i manually masturbate caged animals for artificial insemination .
<muslc> go your own way <muslc>
<muslc> you can call it another lonely day <muslc><muslc>
did you ever notice that all the prices end in " 9 " ?
damn , that' s eerie .
do you know how much the average jiz mopper makes per hour ?
what' s a jiz mopper ?
the guy that cleans up the nudie booths after each guy jerks off .
" nudie booth " ?
yeah , nudie booth .
you ever been in a nudie booth ?
guess not .
oh , man , it' s great .
you go into this booth , and there' s this glass between you and these chicks .
and they put on a show for you for , like , ten bucks .
what kind of a show ?
think of the weirdest , craziest shit you' d like to see chicks do .
these chicks do it all .
they insert things into any opening on their body .
any opening .
can we not talk about this now ?
the jiz mopper' s job is to clean it up after each guy shoots a load .
practically everybody does it right on the window .
i don' t know if you know this , but cum leaves streaks if you don' t clean it right away .
i will never come to this place again .
excuse me ?
using filthy language in front of the customers .
you both should be fired .
oh , l i' m sorry .
i guess we kinda got carried away .
i don' t know if sorry can make up for it .
you' ve highly offended me .
well , if you think that' s offensive , check this out .
oh !
i think you can see her kidneys .
why do you do things like that ?
you know he' s only going to come back and tell the boss .
who cares ?
that guy' s an asshole .
everybody that comes in here is way too uptight .
this job would be great if it wasn' t for the fucking customers .
jesus !
i' m gonna hear from the boss tomorrow .
would you loosen up ?
you' d feel a lot better if you' d just rip into the occasional customer .
why ? l i don' t bother them and they don' t bother me .
liar !
tell me there aren' t customers that annoy the piss out of you on a daily basis .
there aren' t !
how can you lie like that ?
why don' t you vent ?
vent your frustrations .
who pisses you off ?
well , i guess it isn' t customers in particular .
maybe just a group of customers .
well , let' s hear it .
well , the milk maids .
the milk maids ?
the women that go through every gallon of milk , looking for that later date , as if somewhere beyond all the other gallons is a container of milk ... that won' t go bad for like a decade .
you know who i can do without ?
the people in the video store .
which ones ?
all of ' em .
what would you get for a six year old boy who chronically wets his bed ?
so , do you have any new movies in ?
do you have that one with that guy who was in that movie that was out last year ?
they never rent quality flicks .
they always pick the most intellectually devoid movie on the racks .
oooh !
navy seals !
it' s like in order to join they have to have an i. q. less than their shoe size .
you think you get stupid questions ?
you should hear the barrage that i get .
what do you mean there' s no ice ?
i' ve got to drink this coffee hot ?
so , how much is this thing anyway ?
do you sell hubcaps for a ' 72 pinto hatchback ?
ooh !
mini trucker magazine .
see ?
you vented .
don' t you feel better ?
no .
why not ?
because my ex girlfriend is getting married .
jesus , you got a one track mind .
it' s always caitlin , caitlin , caitlin .
veronica !
what happened to home by 12 : 00 ?
boss hasn' t shown up yet .
how come you' re not in class ?
lit .
101 got cancelled .
so i stopped home and i brought you some lunch .
what is it ?
peanut butter and jelly with the crusts cut off .
what do you think it is ? it' s lasagna .
really ?
oh , you' re the queen .
i' m glad you calmed down a bit .
hi , randal .
thirty seven ?
shut up !
yes , i' ve calmed down .
i' m not happy , but i' il be able to deal .
why don' t you go back to the video store ?
you had to tell him ?
i had to tell someone .
he put it into perspective .
what did he say ?
he said at least he wasn' t 36 .
and that made you feel better ?
and he said most of them were college guys i never even seen or met before .
if you don' t see it  it isn' t there .
yes .
thank you for being rational .
thank you for the lasagna .
couldn' t get the shutters open ?
no .
i called the locksmith .
he said the earliest he could be here is tomorrow morning .
bummer .
well , i gotta head back for the 1 : 30 class .
what time you get finished ?
8 : 00 , but i have a sorority meeting ' til 9 : 00 .
so , i' il see you when you close then .
can we go out for coffee ?
sure .
good .
see you when you close .
enjoy the lasagna .
vermont ?
no , that can' t be .
i just talked to him this morning .
he left at what time ?
he really went to vermont ?
when the hell was someone going to tell me ?
he promised me he' d be here by noon !
jesus , when does he get back ?
tuesday ?
you' ve gotta be fucking kidding me !
i' ve got a hockey game at 2 : 00 , and the steel shutters are jammed closed .
and he' s in vermont ?
i' m not even supposed to be here today !
so i' m stuck here until closing ?
oh , this is just great .
i can' t fucking believe this .
th
no .
no , i' m sorry .
i didn' t mean to yell at you .
yeah , i know .
no , l i' il be all right .
well , that' s all i can do , right ?
yeah .
all right , thanks .
bye .
vermont ?
can you fucking believe this ?
he didn' t mention that to you this morning ?
not a word !
not a fucking word , that slippery shit .
so , what ?
you' re stuck here all day ?
fuck !
why' d you apologize ?
what ?
i heard you apologize .
why ?
you had every reason in the world to be mad .
i know !
jesus !
that seems to be the leitmotif in your life .
ever backing down .
i don' t back down !
you always back down .
you assume blame that' s not yours .
you come in on your day off ; you buckle like a belt .
you know what really pisses me off ?
that i' m right about your buckling ?
i' m going to miss the fucking game !
because you buckled .
shut up with that shit .
it ain' t helping !
don' t yell at me , pal .
i' m sorry .
see ?
there you go again .
i can' t believe i' m going to miss the fucking game .
at least we' re stuck here together .
you got a customer .

what do you want ?
i can' t fucking believe this .
yeah , hello , sanford .
dante .
i can' t play today .
i' m stuck at work .
yeah , i know i' m not scheduled today forget it .
point is , i can' t play today .
neither can randal .
he' s working too .
wait a second .
do we have to play at the park ?
hold on .
you feeling limber ?
pull my laces tighter , man .
i' ve got to tell you , my friend , this is one of the most ballsiest moves i' ve ever been privy to .
i never thought you capable of such a blatant disregard of store policy .
i told him i had a game today .
it' s his own fault .
no arguments here . insubordination rules .
i just want to play hockey like i was scheduled to .
i' m gonna grab a gatorade .
lf you grab a gatorade , then everybody' s gonna grab one .
so ?
who' s gonna pay for these gatorades ?
what do you care , you shoe polish smelling motherfucker ?
i have a responsibility here .
i can' t have everybody grabbing free drinks .
what responsibility ?
you' re closing the store to play hockey .
he' s blunt , but he' s got a point .
will you let me maintain some semblance of managerial control ?
no , i' m sayin ' if you' re gonna be insubordinate , might as well go the full nine , not pussy out when it comes to free shit to drink .
he' s right .
as if we' re going to have a run on gatorade .
fuckin ' a.
all right !
jesus , you fuckers are pushy !
i hear caitlin' s marrying an asian drum major .
design major .
can we not talk about this ?
fine by me .
but you' re living in denial and suppressing rage , motherfucker .
you going to lock the store ?
i don' t know .
you' re going to lock the video store ?
look who you' re asking here .
how' re we gonna block the street ?

so i' m told .
yeah .
i had a friend that chewed glass for a living . in the circus .
and he got cancer from chewing fluorescent bulb glass ?
nah .
got hit by a bus .
oh .
can i help you ?
well , uh , that depends .
you got maybe a toilet in here ?
yeah , but it' s for employees only .
i understand .
but i , uh , thought maybe you' d let me use it anyway .
i' m not so young anymore and i' m , how do you say , a little incontinent .
sure . in the back , through the cooler .
thank you , sonny boy .
say , uh , what kind of toilet paper you got back there ?
the white kind .
i didn' t ask about the color .
i mean , is it rough or is it cottony ?
actually , it' s kinda rough .
oh , boy !
it' s gonna knock the hell out of my hemorrhoids .
i thought maybe you could let me have a roll of the soft stuff .
i see you sell the soft stuff back there .
yeah , but  come on , boitshik !
what' s the difference ?
you said yourself you have the rough stuff in the back .
yeah , sure .
go ahead .
thank you , sonny boy .
you' re a lifesaver .
say , young fella , i hate to bother you again , but , uh , maybe i could have something in the back there to read ?
a paper or something ?
sometimes it takes me a while , and i like to have something to read while it' s going on .
yeah , sure , go ahead .
one of the magazines you got in the back behind the counter .
the porno mags ?
yeah !
i like the cartoons .
they make me laugh .
they draw some of the biggest titties you ever saw .
not this one .
maybe the one you got underneath this one .
they got bigger titties in there .
here .
now leave me alone .
oh , thank you , sonny boy .
i appreciate it .
hell of a game .
one ball ?
i close the store , they come all the way here , for one ball ?
hockey is hockey .
at least we got to play .
twelve minutes is not a game .
jesus , it' s hardly even a warm up .
bitch , bitch , bitch .
you want something to drink ?
yeah , a gatorade .
hey , what happened to all the gatorade ?
exactly .
they drank it all .
know what sanford told me ?
i can' t believe caitlin' s getting married .
julie doyer died .
yeah , right .
no , i' m serious .
oh , my god !
sanford' s brother dates her cousin .
he found out this morning .
how ?
when ?
embolism in her brain .
yesterday .
jesus !
she was swimming in the pool in the ymca when it happened .
she died mid backstroke .
i haven' t seen her in , like , two years .
correct me if i' m wrong , but wasn' t she one of the illustrious 12 ?
yeah , number six .
you' ve had sex with a dead person .
i' m gonna go to her wake .
no , you' re not . it' s today .
what ?
posten' s funeral parlor .
next show' s at 4 : 00 .
shit !
what about tomorrow ?
one night only .
she' s buried in the morning .
you gotta watch the store .
i gotta go to this .
wait , wait , wait , wait .
has it occurred to you that i might be bereaved as well ?
you hardly knew her .
true .
but do you know how many people are gonna be there ?
all her old classmates , to say the least .
this is beneath even you .
i' m not gonna miss what' s probably gonna be the social event of the season .
you hate people !
but i love gatherings . isn' t it ironic ?
stop being an asshole .
someone' s gotta watch the store .
lf you go , i go .
she meant nothing to you !
she meant nothing to you neither ' til i told you she died .
i' m not taking you to this funeral .
i' m going with you .
i can' t close the store .
you just closed the store to play hockey on the roof .
exactly !
which means i can' t close it for another hour just so we can both go to a wake .
you were saying ?
thanks for putting me in such a tough spot .
you' re a good friend .
she was pretty young , huh ?
twenty two .
just like us .
embolism in a pool .
what an embarrassing way to die .
that' s nothing compared to how my cousin walter died .
how did he die ?
he broke his neck .
that' s embarrassing ?
he broke his neck trying to suck his own dick .
shut the hell up .
i swear .
stop it .
bible truth .
oh , my god !
come on .
haven' t you ever tried to suck your own dick ?
no .
yeah , right .
you' re so repressed .
because i never tried to suck my own dick ?
no , because you won' t admit to it .
as if a guy' s a fucking pervert ' cause he tries to go down on himself .
you' re as curious as the rest of us , pal .
you' ve tried it .
who found him ?
my cousin ?
mom found him .
it was a mess .
he was on his bed , his legs doubled over himself .
mom freaked out .
<muslc> you know that you are a shooting star <muslc>
made it , huh ?
dick in his mouth ?
yeah .
balls resting on his lips .
wow .
he really made it .
yeah , but at what a price .
i can never reach .
reach what ?
you know .
what , your dick ?
yeah .
like you said , i guess everybody gets curious and tries it sometime .
i never tried it .
fucking pervert .
<muslc> suddenly everyone loved to hear him play his songs <muslc>
<muslc> watch the world go by surprising it goes so fast <muslc>
<muslc> johnny looked around him and said hey , i' ve made the big time at last <muslc><muslc>
i knew this was a bad idea to close the store .
listen to you .
i can' t help it .
at least on the roof , i could see if anybody wanted to go in .
nobody' s there .
it' s 4 : 00 on a saturday .
how many people ever come to the store at 4 : 00 on a saturday ?
let me in !
<muslc> do you know your place <muslc>
<muslc> in the big charade <muslc>
<muslc> are you more than dead <muslc>
<muslc> leaders and followers leaders and followers <muslc><muslc>
i can' t fucking believe you .
i' m telling you , it wasn' t my fault .
you knocked the casket over , for christ' s sake !
i was just leanin ' on it . it was an accident .
like someone knocks a casket over on purpose !
so the casket fell over .
big deal .
her fucking body fell out !
i put her back in it . it' s not like it matters if she breaks something .
just go open the video store .
open the video store !
shut the fuck up , junkie .
would you just go open the video store ?
yeah , you cock smokin ' clerk .
how many times have i told you not to be dealing in front of the store ?
i' m not dealing .
what' re you talking about ?
have you got anything , man ?
what you want ?
let me borrow your car .
i don' t want to talk to you .
fine .
just let me borrow your car .
why should i loan you my car ?
i want to rent a movie .
you want to rent a movie .
what' s that for ?
you work in a video store !
i work in a shitty video store .
i want to go to a good video store so i can get a good movie .
and a pack of cigarettes .
cute cat .
what' s its name ?
annoying customer .
fucking dickhead .
can you imagine being halfway decent to the customers sometimes ?
let me borrow your car .
may i be blunt with you ?
if you must .
we are employees of quick stop convenience and rst video , respectively .
as such , we have certain obligations that , although they may seem cruel and unusual ,
does mean manning the store until closing .
i see .
so playing hockey and attending wakes are standard operating procedures ?
there' s a difference .
those are obligations that couldn' t have been met at any other date .
now , renting videos , that' s gratuitous , not to mention illogical , being that you work at a video store .
are you open ?
yes .
i don' t care for your rationale . it' s gonna have to do , being it' s my car up for request .
can i help you ?
a pack of cigarettes .
what' s your point ?
my point is , you' re a clerk , paid to do a job .
you can' t just do anything you want while you' re working .
space alien revealed as head of time warner .
report stock increase .
they print any kind of shit in this paper .
they certainly do .
three dollars .
your argument is that title dictates behavior .
what ?
the reason you won' t let me use your car is because i have a title and job description ,
and i' m supposed to follow it , right ?
exactly .
i saw one one time that said ,
the next week , the world is ending .
in the next week' s paper , they said ,
we were miraculously saved at the zero hour ... by a koala fish mutant bird .
crazy shit .
so i' m no more responsible for my decisions here than , say , a death squad soldier in bosnia ?
that' s stretching it .
you' re not being asked to slay children or anything .
yeah , not yet .
and i remember one time
i' m gonna break your fucking head , you fucking jerk !
i' m sorry .
he meant to hit me .
yeah ?
well , he missed .
here , let me refund your money and we' il call if even , all right ?
i' il never come in here again .
and if i see you again , i' m gonna break your fucking head open !
what the fuck did you do that for ?
two reasons .
one , i hate it when people can' t shut up about the stupid tabloid headlines .
oh , jesus .
and two , to prove a point .
title does not dictate behavior .
what ?
lf title dictated my behavior as a clerk serving the public ,
i wouldn' t be allowed to spit water at that guy , but i did .
my point is that people dictate their own behavior .
even though i work in a video store , i choose to rent movies at big choice .
agreed ?
you are a danger to both the dead and the living .
i like to think i' m a master of my own destiny .
please get the hell outta here .
you know i' m your hero .
sounds to me like somebody needs to hit the gym .
excuse me ?
i heard you strain when you picked up that milk . it only weighs seven pounds .
i didn' t strain .
i sighed .
i don' t think so .
that was a grunt .
a deep inhalation of oxygen to aid in the stretching of muscles .
i' m a trainer .
i know what that sound signifies .
you' re out of shape .
what ?
there' s no fat on my body .
no fat !
no tone either .
you don' t get enough exercise .
you open ?
yes .
just the paper .
thirty five .
hey , uh , let me ask you a question .
think this guy' s out of shape ?
i don' t know .
can' t really tell from here .
i am i am not !
he is .
how much can you bench ?
i don' t know .
i' d say about 60 , 70 , tops .
i know i can bench more than that .
three fifty , four .
no way !
feel that .
hey , that' s tight .
solid .
yeah .
now feel this .
roll up your sleeve , chief .
oh , for god' s sakes !
see , you' re ashamed .
you know you' re out of shape .
here .
take my card .
i can get you on an aerobics/ free weights program .
are you open ?
yes .
i' m not out of shape .
excuse me .
have you been here all day ?
yeah , since 6 : 00 this morning .
he' s got those love handles .
i don' t have love handles !
were you working here about 4 : 00 ?
yes . it' s probably from being around all this food every day .
oh , i know .
if i had to work here all day , i' d be bloated and out of shape too .
i' m not out of shape .
can i have your name , please ?
dante hicks .
why ?
what' s this all about ?
you' re dante hicks ?
oh , my god .
i didn' t even recognize you .
because he' s out of shape !
do i know you ?
yeah .
do you remember alyssa jones ?
she used to hang out
with caitlin bree !
i' m her sister .
you' re alyssa' s sister heather ?
yeah .
you , uh , say caitlin bree ?
yeah .
pretty girl ?
a little taller than her ?
gorgeous body ?
yeah .
and you' re dante hicks .
you went to the same school .
you played hockey .
yeah .
how did you know that ?
you still goin ' out with her ?
no , she' s getting married .
to you ?
no .
to an asian design major .
aw , shit !
don' t take this the wrong way , but , uh , i used to fuck her .
what ?
yeah , about two , three years ago .
while you two were dating .
i drove a black trans am .
you' re rick daress ?
yeah .
you know him ?
yeah .
caitlin used to talk about him all the time .
really ?
wait a second .
you used to fuck caitlin bree while i was dating her ?
nah , man , don' t let it bother you .
that was a long time ago .
i' m surprised you didn' t know about it , dante .
everybody in school knew about it .
even in my class .
jesus christ !
what next ?
here you go .
what' s this ?
a fine for $500 .
what ?
five hundred bucks ?
for what ?
for violation of new jersey statute , section 2a , number 170/ 51 .
any person who sells or makes available tobacco , or tobacco related products , to persons under the age of 18 , is regarded as disorderly .
what are you talkin ' about ?
an angry mother called the state division of taxation ... and claimed that a quick stop employee ... sold her four year old daughter a pack of cigarettes at 4 : 00 today .
the new jersey division of taxation called the board of health ... and sent me down to issue a fine .
you claimed you were working here all day .
hence , the fine is yours .
the fine is doubled due to the incredibly young age of the child .
but i didn' t sell any cigarettes to any kids !
you sold cigarettes to a four year old ?
what a scumbag !
that' s sick , dante .
i didn' t sell cigarettes to any kids !
i swear !
the due date is on the bottom .
this summons cannot be contested in any court of law .
failure to remit before the due date ... will result in a charge of criminal negligence , and a warrant will be issued for your arrest .
have a nice day .
but i didn' t sell any cigarettes to any kids .
hey , wait a minute !
forget it .
i don' t wanna deal with a guy that sells cigarettes to four year olds .
can i , uh , give you a lift somewhere ?
sure .
how ' bout the beach ?
i like the way you think .
jesus !
what next ?
dante ?
what ?
caitlin !
<muslc><muslc> [ muzak ]
when did you get home ?
just now .
i can' t believe it .
i haven' t seen you in so long .
dante , you have a customer .
i just saw alyssa' s little sister outside .
she was with rick daress .
let' s not talk about her .
how' d you get home ?
train . it took eight hours .
i can' t believe you' re here .
excuse me .
do you have
uh , yeah .
back behind the oil .
how long you staying ?
until monday .
then i have to take the train back .
pack of cigarettes .
hey , congratulations .
i saw the announcement in today' s paper .
you know , she' s marrying an asian design major .
so i' m told .
<muslc><muslc> [ hip hop ]
you' re just gonna close the store like that ?
i wanna talk to you about something , and i don' t wanna be disturbed .
something i read in the tabloids .
you saw it .
very dramatic , i thought . it is not what you think .
oh , it' s not what i think .
what is it , worse ?
you' re pregnant with the asian design major' s child ?
what' s goin ' on here ?
i am not pregnant .
were you gonna tell me , or were you gonna send me an invitation ?
i was gonna tell you , but we were getting along so well , i didn' t wanna mess it up .
you could' ve broken it to me gently .
you could' ve started by telling me you had a boyfriend .
i told you i had a girlfriend .
i know .
i' m sorry , but when we started talking , it was like i forgot i had a boyfriend .
and then he proposed last month .
and you said yes .
well , kind of .
sort of .
is that what they teach you in that school of yours ?
kind of , " " sort of " ?
everybody knows about this except me !
do you know how humiliating that is ?
i would' ve told you , and you would' ve stopped calling me , like a baby .
how do you know that ?
because i know you .
you prefer drastic measures to rational ones .
so you' re really getting married ?
no .
you' re not really getting married ?
he proposed , i told him i had to think about it , and he insisted that i wear the ring anyway .
then my mother told the paper we were engaged .
oh , how like her .
then my mother called this morning ... to let me know that the announcement was in the paper .
that' s when i hopped a train to come back here , because i knew you' d be a wreck .
thanks for the vote of confidence .
was i right ?
wreck " is a harsh term .
disturbed " is more like it .
mildly disturbed , " even .
oh , i love a macho facade .
it is such a turn on .
what smells like shoe polish ?
so you came here to what ?
to comfort me ?
the last thing i needed was for you to think i was hiding something from you .
but you were !
no , i wasn' t !
not really .
i told you i' d been seeing other people .
yeah , but not seriously .
christ , you' re ready to walk down the aisle .
i think that constitutes something more than just seeing somebody .
what' s going on ?
i' m giving him his ring back .
what ?
i don' t want to marry him .
i don' t want to get married now .
i' m on the verge of graduation .
i want to go to grad school after this , and then i want to start a career .
i don' t want to be a wife first and then have to worry about ... when i' m gonna fit in the other stuff .
i have come way too far and studied too damn hard ... to let my education go to waste as a housewife .
and i know that' s what i' d become .
sang' s just signed with a major firm , and he' s gonna be pulling in a huge salary , which would give me no reason to work .
he' s very traditional .
wait a minute .
his name is " sang " ?
past tense ?
stop it .
he' s a nice guy .
well , if he' s so nice , why aren' t you marrying him ?
i just told you .
there' s more to this , isn' t there ?
oh !
why , mr. hicks , whatever do you mean ?
tell me i don' t have something to do with it .
you have nothing to do with it .
oh , you lie !
look how full of yourself you are !
i just believe in giving credit where credit' s due , and i believe i' m the impetus behind your refusal to wed .
if i' m so nuts about you , then why am i having sex with an asian design major ?
oh , jesus .
you' re so caustic .
i had to knock you down from that cloud you were floating on .
when i say i don' t want to get married , i mean just that .
i don' t want to marry anybody .
not for years .
who' s asking ?
i don' t want to marry you .
well , good .
keep in that frame of mind .
well , let' s date .
oh , i think sang and ...
veronica , they' d love that .
we can introduce the two of them .
they may hit it off .
you' re serious ?
you wanna date again ?
i wanna be your boyfriend , yes .
it' s just the shock of seeing me after three years .
believe me , you' il get over it .
give me a bit more credit .
i think it' s time we got back together .
i' m more mature , you' re more mature .
you' re finishing college .
i' m already in the job market .
you work in a market , all right .
cute .
tell me you wouldn' t wanna go out with me again ... after all the talking we' ve been doing .
the key word here is " talk , " dante .
i think the idea , or the conception of us dating , is a lot more idyilic than what actually happens when we date .
what are we supposed to do ?
pretend over the phone we' re dating ?
i don' t know .
maybe we should just see what happens .
let me take you out tonight .
on a date ?
yeah , a real date .
dinner and a movie .
oh , the " dante hicks dinner and movie " date .
i think i' ve been on that one before .
do you have a better suggestion ?
well , how ' bout the " caitlin bree ...
walk on the boardwalk , then get naked somewhere " kind of private date ?
i hear that' s kind of a popular date .
jerk !
god , here i am , throwing myself at you , succumbing to your wily charms , and you' re calling me a slut in so many words .
what about sing ?
sang !
he' s not invited .
he' s your fianc .
i' m offering you my body , and you' re offering me semantics .
he' s just a boyfriend , dante , and in case you haven' t gotten the drift ... of why i came all the way here from ohio
duh !
i' m about to become single again .
and , yes , allow me to placate your ego .
you are the inspiration for this bold and momentous decision ... that will probably get me ostracized from both school and home .
you ask me who i choose .
i choose you .
so , what are you saying ?
you are such an asshole .
i' m just kidding !
i can already see this is not gonna work out .
i' il ask randal to close up when he gets back .
where is he , anyway ?
i thought he' d be at your side like an obedient lapdog .
he went to go rent a movie .
he isn' t back yet .
ah , screw it .
i' il close up and leave him a note .
you are too responsible .
but no , i have to go home first .
they don' t even know i' ve left school yet .
and i should break the disengagement news to my mother , which is gonna cause quite a row considering she loves sang .
who doesn' t ?
well , me , i guess .
so i shall take my leave of you , but i will return in a little while , at which time , yes , i would love to go for dinner and a movie with you .
what happened to the walk and the nakedness ?
i' m easy , but i' m not that easy .
see you later , handsome .
yes !
<muslc><muslc> [ hip hop ]
get to work .
hey , what' d you rent ?
best of both worlds ?
hermaphroditic porn .
starlets with both organs .
you should see the box .
beautiful chicks with dicks that put mine to shame .
and you rented this ?
hey , i like to expand my horizons .
i got fined for selling cigarettes to a minor .
no way .
five hundred dollars .
you' re bullshittin ' .
no , i' m not .
holy shit !
i didn' t even think they enforced this .
living proof .
i thought you never sold cigarettes to kids .
i didn' t .
you did .
really ?
yep .
a little girl , maybe four years old .
holy shit !
that girl ?
yeah , as opposed to hundreds of other children ... you' ve sold cigarettes while working here .
then how come you got the fine ?
' cause i' m here .
you' re lyin ' .
no , i' m not .
why aren' t you screaming at me now ?
' cause i' m happy .
i' m happy .
you' re happy to get a fine ?
no , because caitlin came to see me .
now i know you' re lyin ' .
i' m not .
she just left .
what' d she say ?
she' s not marrying that guy .
she went home to tell her mom .
you' re kiddin ' .
i' m not .
well , you' ve had quite an evening .
she went home and she' s getting ready and we' re going out .
i feel so ineffectual .
is there anything i can do for you ?
watch the store while i go home and change ?
what happened to " title dictates behavior " ?
well , this is my way of spitting water at life .
all right .
you want me to bring the vcr over so we can watch this ?
no , i might be leaving early to go out with caitlin , in which case , you' re gonna lock up the store tonight .
all right , but you' re missin ' out .
chicks with dicks .
<muslc><muslc> [ " berserker " on tape deck ]
uh , no .
oh .
well , randal graves , scourge of the video renter .
ladies and gentlemen , miss asian design major herself , caitlin bree .
you saw that article ?
god , isn' t it awful ?
my mother sent that in .
i take it she likes the guy .
you' d think she' s marrying him .
what are you watching ?
children' s programming .
what' d your mom say when you told her you weren' t engaged anymore ?
she said not to come home until after graduation .
wow !
you got thrown out for dante ?
what can i say ?
he does weird things to me .
ooh , can i watch ?
you can hold me down .
can i join in ?
you might be let down .
i' m not a hermaphrodite .
hey , few are .
what makes you think you can maintain a relationship with him this time around ?
a woman' s intuition .
something inside of me says it' s time to give the old boy a serious try .
wow !
hey , you know , you and i have something in common .
we both eat chinese .
dick .
exactly .
so where is he ?
he went home to change for the big date .
god , isn' t he great ?
no .
this is great .
oh , lord .
can i use your bathroom ?
there' s no lights back there .
why aren' t there any lights ?
there are , but for some reason they stop working at 5 : 14 every night .
you' re kidding .
nobody can figure it out .
the boss doesn' t want to pay the electrician to fix it ...
' cause the electrician owes money to the video store .
such a sordid state of affairs .
and i' m caught in the middle , torn between my loyalty for the boss and my desire to piss with the lights on .
well , i' il try to manage .
oh , hey , caitlin ?
break his heart again this time , and i' il kill ya .
nothing personal .
you are very protective of him , randal .
you always have been .
territoriality .
he was mine first .
oh , that was so cute .
who eats cock ?
bunch of savages in this town .
hey , caitlin' s in the back .
you might want to check on her .
she' s been back there a long time .
there are no lights back there .
i told her that .
she said she didn' t need any .
why don' t you go join her ?
make a little bathroom bam bam .
oh , i love your sexy talk .
it' s so kindergarten .
" poo poo , " " wee wee .
fuck you .
i said stop .
oh , god .
how did you get here so fast ?
i left like an hour ago .
do you always talk this weird after you violate a woman ?
maybe the asian design major slipped her some opium .
could be . it has never been like that before .
like what ?
when you just lay perfectly still and let me do everything .
am i missing something here ?
okay .
i went back there and dante was already waiting for me .
he was ? it was so cool .
he didn' t say a word .
he didn' t have to .
he was just ... ready .
you know .
and , like , we didn' t kiss or talk or anything .
he just sat there and let me do all the work .
you dog !
i didn' t even see you go back there .
the fact that there weren' t any lights on made it so
god , that was so great !
my legs are still shaking .
it wasn' t me .
yeah , right .
who was it , then ?
randal ?
was it you ?
i was up here the whole time .
you two better quit it .
i' m serious .
oh , so we didn' t just have sex in the bathroom ?
no .
stop it .
this isn' t funny .
i' m not fooling around .
i just came in from outside .
this isn' t fucking funny , dante .
i' m not kidding .
who went back there ?
nobody .
i swear .
i feel nauseous .
are you sure there was someone back there ?
well , i didn' t just fuck myself !
jesus christ !
god , i' m gonna be sick !
you just fucked a total stranger ?
shut the fuck up !
i can' t believe this .
call the police .
why ?
no , don' t !
there' s a stranger in our bathroom !
he just raped caitlin !
she said she did all the work .
will you shut the fuck up ?
who the fuck' s in our bathroom ?
who is he ?
i don' t know .
he just came in and asked to use the bathroom .
what time was this ?
i don' t know .
what time did hockey end ?
um , like 3 : 00 , 3 : 30 .
what time we get back from the funeral ?
4 : 00 , i think .
wait .
who was working here ?
just me .
i thought you just said you went to play hockey and then went to a funeral .
yeah , we did .
then who was operating the store ?
nobody . it was closed .
with this guy locked in here ?
well , everything happened so quickly , i guess i forgot he was back there .
can we take it now ?
go ahead .
was he alive when caitlin
no .
i place the time of death about 3 : 20 .
then how could she you know .
the body can maintain an erection after expiration , sometimes for hours .
did he have the adult magazine when he came in ?
uh , no .
i gave it to him .
he asked me for it .
i can' t say for certain until we get him back to the lab , but my guess is ... he was masturbating , his heart seized and he died .
that' s when the girl found him .
uh , something smells like shoe polish .
this has got to be the weirdest thing you' ve ever been called in on .
actually , i once had to tag a kid that broke his neck trying to put his mouth on his penis .
what about caitlin ?
shock trauma .
she' s gonna need years of therapy after this .
how did she come to have sex with a dead man ?
she thought it was me .
what kind of convenience store do you run here ?
<muslc><muslc> [ humming " theme from jaws " ]
salsa shark .
we' re gonna need a bigger boat .
man goes into cage , cage goes into salsa .
shark' s in the salsa .
our shark .
oh , what ?
what' s with you , man ?
you haven' t said anything for , like , 20 minutes .
what the hell' s your problem ?
this life .
" this life " ?
why do i have this life ?
have some chips .
you' il feel better .
i' m stuck in this pit , working for less than slave wages , working on my day off .
the goddamn steel shutters are closed .
i deal with every backward assed fuck on the planet .
i smell like shoe polish .
my ex girlfriend is catatonic after fucking a dead guy , and my present girlfriend has sucked 36 dicks .
thirty seven .
my life' s in the shitter right now , and if you don' t mind , i' d like to stew a bit .
you open ?
yeah .
aw , that' s all bullshit , man .
you know what the real problem here is ?
i was born ?
you should shit or get off the pot .
i should shit or get off the pot .
yeah , shit or get off the pot .
what are you talking about ?
i' m talking about this thing you have , this inability to improve your station in life .
fuck you ! it' s true , man .
you sit there and blame life for dealin ' you a cruddy hand , never once accepting responsibility for the way your situation is .
what responsibility ?
all right , if you hate this job and the people ... and the fact that you have to come in on your day off , why don' t you quit ?
like it' s that easy . it is .
you just up and quit .
there' s other jobs .
they pay better money .
you' re bound to be qualified for at least one of ' em .
so what' s stoppin ' you ?
leave me alone .
oh , you' re comfortable , right ?
this is a life of convenience for you , and any attempt to change it ... would shatter the pathetic microcosm you' ve fashioned for yourself .
oh !
like your life' s any better .
i' m satisfied with my situation for now .
you don' t hear me complaining .
you , on the other hand , have been bitching all day .
thank you .
why don' t you go back to the video store ? it' s the same thing with veronica .
leave her out of this !
you date veronica because it' s convenient and she' s low maintenance .
but meanwhile , all you ever do is talk about caitlin .
you carry a torch for a girl you dated in high school . in high school , for god' s sakes .
you' re 22 .
leave me alone !
if you want caitlin , then talk to veronica and be with caitlin .
if you want veronica , then be with veronica .
but don' t pine for one and fuck the other .
man , if you weren' t such a fucking coward
if i wasn' t such a fucking coward .
it must be great to have this ability to simplify things the way you do .
am i right or what ?
you' re wrong !
things happened today .
things that probably ruined my chances with caitlin .
oh , what , the dead guy ?
she' il get over fuckin ' a dead guy .
shit , my mom' s been fuckin ' a dead guy for 30 years .
i call him " dad .
caitlin and i can' t be together .
it' s impossible .
melodrama comin ' from you seems about as natural as an oral bowel movement .
what do you want me to say ?
yes , some of the things you' re saying are true " ?
that' s the way things are .
they' re not gonna change .
make ' em change .
i can' t , all right ?
jesus , will you leave me alone ?
i can' t make changes in my life like that . lf i could , i would .
but i don' t have the ability to risk the comfortable situations ... on the big money and the fabulous prizes !
who are you kidding ?
you can so .
jesus h. christ !
i can' t !
so you' re gonna be miserable ' cause you don' t have the guts to face change ?
my mother told me once that when i was three years old , my potty lid was closed , and instead of me lifting it , i shit my pants .
lovely story .
the point is , i' m not the type of person ... who' il disrupt things just so i can shit comfortably .
<muslc> noise , noise , noise smokin ' weed , smokin ' weed <muslc>
<muslc> doin ' coke , drinkin ' beers <muslc> pack o ' " rass , " my good man .
time to kick back , drink some beers and smoke some weed !
done poisoning the youth for today , huh ?
hell , yes , whatever that means .
now it' s time to head over to atlantic , drink some beers , get ripped and , hopefully , get laid .
one seventy nine .
pay the good man .
yeah , you close soon ? in half an hour .
yeah , we get off the same time every day .
we should hang out .
you get high ?
i should start .
wanna come to this party tonight ?
there' s gonna be some pussy there .
with you ?
i don' t think so .
oh , look at you .
i don' t hang out with drug dealers .
nothing personal .
what happened with that old guy ?
he died in the bathroom .
i heard he was jerkin ' off or something .
i don' t know .
i wasn' t watching .
he probably saw that caitlin chick .
i know i felt like beatin ' it when i saw her .
oh , come here , bitch .
you like this ?
huh ?
this what you want ?
knock it off .
that used to be my girlfriend , all right ?
oh , you used to go out with her ?
yeah , well , i thought we might be starting again .
don' t you already have a girlfriend ?
yeah , veronica .
and what , you' re gonna dump her for that caitlin chick ?
maybe .
i don' t know , dude .
that caitlin chick' s nice , but i see that veronica girl ... doin ' shit for you all the time .
i saw her rubbin ' your back , fuckin ' comes and brings your food .
didn' t i see her change your tire once ?
hey , i jacked up the car .
all she did was unloosen the nuts and put the tire on .
well , i know she does a lot for you .
she' s my girlfriend .
i had some girlfriends too , but all they wanted from me was weed and shit .
shit , my grandmother used to say , " what' s better ?
fuckin ' a good plate with nothin ' on it ?
no , wait .
i fucked up .
what' s a good plate with nothin ' on it ?
meaning ?
i don' t know .
she was senile .
she used to fuckin ' piss herself all the time ... and shit herself .
come on , silent bob .
let' s get the fuck outta this fuckin ' gyp joint ... with this fuckin ' faggot dante .
you cock smoker .
you know , there' s a million fine lookin ' women in the world , dude , but they don' t all bring ya lasagna at work .
most of ' em just cheat on ya .
come on , limp dick !
yeah , yeah , yeah .
he' s right .
i love her .
so that' s it .
he doesn' t love you anymore .
he loves caitlin .
and he told you all of this ?
pretty much .
all except the latent homosexuality part .
that' s just my theory .
uh i don' t know what to say .
don' t hold it against him .
he just never got caitlin out of his system .
it' s not your fault . it' s dante .
i look .
i don' t know thing one about chicks .
so if you gotta cry or something , i can get outta here .
i' m not sad .
you' re not ?
ow !
what' d you do that for ?
if you didn' t wanna go out with me anymore , why didn' t you say so ?
instead you pussyfoot around and see that slut behind my back !
what are you talking about ?
you' ve been talking to her on the phone for weeks ! it was only a few times .
then you pull that shit this morning , freaking out because i' ve gone down a couple of guys .
oh , a couple ?
i' m not the one trying to patch things up with my ex , sneaking around behind your back !
if you think 37 dicks are a lot , just wait and see , mister .
i' m going to put the hookers in times square to shame with all the guys i go down on now !
will you let me explain ?
explain what ?
how you' ve been waiting until the time was right , and then you were going to dump me for her ? it isn' t like that !
damn right it isn' t like that !
because i won' t let it be like that .
you want your slut ?
fine , the slut is yours .
i don' t want caitlin .
you don' t know what you want !
but i' m not going to sit here holding your hand anymore until you figure it out !
i' ve tried with you , dante .
i' ve encouraged you to get out of this fucking dump and go back to school , to take charge of your life and find direction .
i even transferred so maybe you' d be more inclined ... to go back to college if i was with you .
everyone said it was a stupid move , but i didn' t care ... because i loved you and wanted to see you ... pull yourself out of this senseless funk that you' ve been in ... since that whore dumped you oh , so many years ago .
now you wanna go back to her so she can fuck you over some more !
i don' t wanna go back  of course not !
not now !
you' re caught , and now you' re trying to snake out of doing what you wanted to do !
well , i won' t let you .
i want you to follow through on this so you can find out what a fucking idiot you are !
and when she dumps you again and i promise you , she will
i want to laugh in your face so you realize that ... that was what you gave up our relationship for !
i' m just glad that randal had the balls to tell me since you couldn' t !
randal ?
and having him tell me , that was just the weakest move ever .
you' re spineless !
veronica , i love you !
fuck you !
dante ?
<muslc> our problems seem a world away <muslc>
<muslc> close your eyes <muslc>
<muslc> and they' il all go away <muslc>
<muslc> close the night and listen <muslc>
<muslc> close your eyes to me <muslc>
<muslc> and sell the lie <muslc>
<muslc> my face <muslc>
<muslc> shall live <muslc>
<muslc> you' il all be replaced <muslc><muslc>
how' s your eye ?
the swelling' s not that bad , but the f. d. s. stings .
how' s your neck ? it' s kinda hard to swallow .
you didn' t have to choke me , you know .
why did you tell veronica that i was gonna dump her to go back with caitlin ?
i thought i was doing you a favor .
oh , jesus .
you' re always saying how you can' t initiate change yourself .
i thought i' d give you a hand .
thanks .
you still didn' t have to choke me .
oh , please .
i' m surprised i didn' t kill you .
why do you say that ?
why do i say that ?
randal [ sighs ]
forget it .
no , really .
what did i do that was so wrong ?
what don' t you do ?
sometimes i think the only reason you come to work is to make my life miserable .
how do you figure ?
what time did you get to work today ?
like 10 : 00 , or ten after .
you were over a half an hour late .
and then all you do is come in here .
yeah , to talk to you .
which means the video store is ostensibly closed !
oh , it' s not like i' m miles away .
unless you' re out renting video at other video stores .
hermaphrodites .
i rented it so we could watch it together .
you get me slapped with a fine .
you argue with the customers , and i have to patch everything up .
you get us thrown out of a funeral by violating the corpse .
then to top it all off , you ruin my relationship .
i mean , what' s your encore ?
do you , like , anally rape my mother while pouring sugar in my gas tank ?
you know what the real tragedy about all of this is ?
i' m not even supposed to be here today !
oh , fuck you !
fuck you , pal !
jesus , there you go , trying to pass the buck .
i' m the source of all your misery .
who closed the store to play hockey ?
who closed the store to go to a wake ?
who tried to win back his ex girlfriend ... without even discussing how he felt with his present one ?
you wanna blame somebody ?
blame yourself .
i' m not even supposed to be here today .
you sound like an asshole !
jesus , nobody twisted your arm to be here .
you' re here of your own volition .
you like to think the weight of the world rests on your shoulder ,
like this place would fall apart if dante wasn' t here .
jesus , you overcompensate for having what' s basically a monkey' s job .
you push fuckin ' buttons .
anybody could waltz in here and do our jobs .
you' re so obsessed with making it seem so much more epic , so much more important than it really is .
christ , you work in a convenience store , dante , and badly , i might add !
i work in a shitty video store , badly as well .
you know , that guy jay' s got it right .
he has no delusions about what he does .
us , we like to make ourselves seem so much more important ... than the people that come in here to buy a paper or , god forbid , cigarettes .
we look down on them as if we' re so advanced .
well , if we' re so fuckin ' advanced , what are we doin ' workin ' here ?
hey , the floor looks pretty clean .
i put the cat next door .
need a ride home ?

same time .
what about you ?
i' m callin ' out .

and then i' m gonna try to talk to veronica .
you wanna grab a bite to eat or something ... when you' re done with that and i get off work ?
i' il give you a call , let you know .
all right .
hey , good luck with veronica .
lf you want , i can talk to her , try and straighten this  no , thanks .
i think i can handle it .
we have a lot of shit to talk about .
hell of a day .
to say the least .

why don' t you wrangle for me ?
