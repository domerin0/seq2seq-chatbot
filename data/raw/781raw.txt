you said he wasn' t coming .
you didn' t call the doctor ?
just to be on the safe side .
i' m fine .
i ran it under a cold tap .
we had ourjabs when we went to the isle of wight .
but , philip ...
it' s overblown nonsense .
a lot of drug nuts running wild .

i' m not going anywhere without philip .
mum , look !
how about that tea ?
mum , how much do you love philip ?
two sugars , is it ?
i haven' t had sugar in my tea since 1982 .
oh , yes .
will you cut me some bread , love ?
mum , look , how much do you love philip ?
do we have to go through all that again ?
what would you say if i told you that philip' s been quite unkind to me ?
you weren' t easy to live with .
he chased me with a bit of wood !
you did call him a you know what .
did he tell you that ?
motherfucker .
shaun !
sorry , mother ...
mum !
did you know that on several occasions ... he touched me ?
that wasn' t true .
made it up , shouldn' t have , sorry .
you don' t understand ...
no , you don' t understand .
philip is my husband and has been for 17 years and i would at least expect you to respect my feelings .
you must be more adult about these things .
yeah .
come on , shaun .
there comes a time when ... you just ... gotta be a man .
i' m telling you , it' s a fuss over nothing .
hello , edward .
hi , barbara .
my , how you' ve grown .
you better believe it .
what happened ?
why is he coming ?
it wasn' t as easy as all that .
are we following you ?
no , it' s probably best if we ...
where' s the car ?
hmm ...
i pranged it .
you were parked .
yeah .
i guess we' il have to take the jag .
philip ?
what ?
look out !
christ !
give me the car keys !
you' re not driving that car .
give me the car keys !
ed , get mum in the car .
i' m on it .
don' t worry about me .
worry about your mother .
maybe i should drive .
i' ve adjusted the seat now .
just be careful !
can you please turn that noise down ?
are you all right , dear ?
would you like another tissue ?
i' d be fine if it weren' t for that bloody racket .
it is a bit loud .
sorry , barbara .
you do realise this is a 20 mile an hour zone ?
oh , yeah .
here .
mum , this won' t take a second , all right ?
have you still got the child locks on ?
safety first , shaun .
you can' t ...
hey , man , watch the leather .
keep moving .
if there' s any problems ...
i' il do the honks .
' hello ? '
hello ?
guys , can you let me in ?
what are you doing ?
i' ve come to get you .
what are you doing ?
i' ve come to take you somewhere safe .
we were safe !
you don' t know that .
there was two of them out there .
how many are there now ?
lots .
lots !
it only takes one of them to know you' re in here .
i tried calling but i couldn' t get through .
i had to come up with a plan .
oh , you made a plan ?
we have to get out of here .
if we don' t , they' il tear us to pieces .
and that will exacerbate things for all of us .
shaun ...
this is not about you and me .
this is about survival .
we need to be somewhere more secure , somewhere we can stay alive .
we' re with you , shaun .
what ?
we' re with you .
i' m not going out there .
daffs !
i don' t want to be torn to pieces and if you think about it , neither do you .
i' m not going if lizzie' s not going .
she' s going .
i' m not staying by myself .
you' re going , aren' t you ?
lizzie ?
liz ?
all right , flash , what' s your plan ?
great .
i' ve got a car but it' s gonna be a bit cramped now .
has anyone got transport ?
yes !
great .
where ?
oh , no .
well , i' ve passed my test .
david ?
i don' t see the point of owning a car in london .
look , just get any blunt objects together .
if you get cornered , bash them in the head .
keep together , stay sharp and follow me .
so , what' s the plan , then ?
we' re going to the winchester .
ok ?
let' s go .
come on .
where' s the car ?
what' s up , niggaz ?
apologies for the cramped conditions .
di , stay on david' s lap .
philip , hang in there , ok ?
ed , get there fast .
and , mum , this is liz .
liz , mum .
hello .
ed , be careful .
is your dad all right ?
he' s not my dad .
he' s bleeding .
i know !
ed , be careful .
thought you wanted to get there fast ?
i want to get there in one piece !
why are we going this way ?
chill out , it' s a short cut .
that road goes to the winchester .
shaun ...
liz , please !
i don' t understand why the winchester ?
it' s a pub , it' s safe , it' s secure .
they know us .
what makes it so secure ?
it' s got big heavy doors and deadbolts .
and there' s a rifle above the bar .
i would think that' s deactivated .
it' s not .
john' s connected .
big al says so .
big al also says dogs can' t look up .
they can' t .
can' t they ?
of course they can !
are you sure ?
yes !
the pub is the right place to go .
everything is gonna be fine .
shaun ...
i turned it off , all right ?
what ?
being a father , it' s not easy .
what ?
you were 12 when i met you , you' d already grown up so much .
i just wanted you to be strong and not give up because you lost your dad .
philip , you don' t have to explain .
no , i do .
i always loved you , shaun .
and i always thought you had it in you to do well .
you just need ... m motivation .
somebody to look up to and ...
i thought it could be me .
would you just ... take care of your mum ?
there' s a good boy .
ed , can you pull over ?
two seconds .
ah !
ed , please pull over .
what for ?
just pull over !
all right .
whoa , momma !
what the hell are you doing ?
chill out .
everyone' s all right .
stop telling me to chill out !
and everybody is not all right .
what' s wrong ?
mum , it' s philip , he' s gone .
where' s he gone ?
mum , he' s dead .
no , he isn' t .
get out !
jesus !
get it open !
ed , get the child locks !
quick !
the child lock !
ed !
now what ?
we keep moving .
how do we get philip out the car ?
we haven' t got time .
we can' t leave your dad .
he' s not my dad !
mum , he was , but he' s not any more .
i really think we could ...
that' s not your husband in there .
ok ?
it looks like him but there is nothing of the man you loved in that car .
let' s go , shall we ?
you' re not suggesting we walk ?
everybody ok ?
yeah , we' re having a whale of a time .
maybe we should all hold hands , make a crocodile ?
do you know where we' re going ?
david , come on .
sorry .
do you , though ?
yeah , totally .
are we close ?
we' re pretty close .
is your mum gonna be ok ?
yeah , i hope so .
did you contact your folks ?
they' re in antigua .
do you think this is happening there ?
i hope not .
about last night .
i know loads of things were said but ...
you said this wasn' t about us .
no , it' s not .
you said it was about survival .
it is , but ...
you' re notjust trying to prove something ?
i meant everything i said last night .
maybe this isn' t the best time to talk .
ok .
shaun .
yvonne .
how' s it going ?
er , surviving .
hey , liz .
long time no see .
hey , yvonne .
erm ... this is my boyfriend , declan .
erm ... my friends mark , maggie ,
my mum and my cousin tom .
all right .
this is shaun and his girlfriend liz .
they' ve split up , actually .
oh , really ?
yeah .
that' s a shame .
we should scoot .
have you got somewhere you' re going ?
yeah , we' re going to the winchester .
the pub ?
yeah .
right , well .
good luck !
hi .
hello .
hi .
hello .
all right .
see ?
the winchester' s just over there .
over where ?
over there .
just over there , over the 20 garden fences ?
what' s the matter , david ?
never taken a short cut before ?
shaun .
i' m sure jill and derek live round here .
now , the winchester is just over that fence , all right ?
everyone stay where they are , i' il ...
are we all here ?
one , two , three , four , five .
yes .
there' s six of us .
mum !
i' m coming !
mum , are you ok ?
are you ok ?
i don' t think jill and derek do live here .
shaun ?
are you all right ?
what are you doing ?
shaun !
yes !
no , that' s rubbish .
ooh !
yes !
feel free to step in any time .
you did all right .
i didn' t want to cramp your style .
i' m so sorry about that .
right .
ok , everyone stay where they are .
i' m gonna check if the coast is clear .
is it clear ?
no .
how many ?
lots .
oh , well , that is just great .
there are a fair few of them , yes .
i trust shaun has another genius scheme up his sleeve ?
this is hardly constructive , david !
we should have stayed at the flat .
why didn' t you ?
because ...
because , because of ...
captain wow .
will you stop it ?
we' il get nowhere moaning .
right , let' s all shake out .
get nice and limber .
or not .
take another look at the way he moves .
remember , very limp .
almost like sleepwalking .
look at the face , it' s vacant with a hint of sadness .
like a drunk who' s lost a bet .
ok , let' s try , shall we ?
liz .
nice .
good vocal work .
ok .
barbara , that' s excellent .
sorry , dear , i was miles away .
d daffs .
uh .
come on !
urgh .
it' s mournful , sorrowful , you' re dead and you hate it .
go .
uuurgh .
much better .
ed .
i' il do it on the night .
this is the night !
what is that ?
what about yours ?
who died and made you fucking king of the zombies ?
don' t ...
yeah , that' s pretty good .
right , let' s all try together , shall we ?
one , two , three .
go , go , go , go .
shit !
get round me , get round me !
john ?
john , bernie , are you there ?
it' s shaun and ed .
we come in all the time .
they can hear you .
we do the quiz .
they know .
stay in character !
i can' t see them .
shaun , we have to get inside .
break the window .
we' il be exposed !
break the window !
is there another way in ?
yeah , there' s ...
two seconds .
hey , noodle .
' all right ? ' yeah , man , i can' t talk now .
' you get anything yet ? ' i got nothing .
i' m in the middle of something .
yeah , it' s weird .
oi !
what are you doing ?
what are you doing ?
you stupid moron .
fuck off .
you fuck off !
fuck fucking off !
i' ve spent an entire life ...
look at me .
i' ve spent my entire life sticking up for you and all you ever do is fuck things up and make me look stupid .
i' m not gonna let you do it any more .
not today !
shaun .
oh .
you were saying about another way in ?
yeah , there' s a ...
what are you doing ?
no !
get inside .
no , they' il follow us .
keep up the act , i' il have to do something .
what do you mean do something ?
hello , hello , over here !
come on , that' s it .
come on , that' s it , over here !
over here !
come on .
oh , bollocks .
wait till i' ve gone then get inside .
gone where ?
i won' t be long , i promise .
come on , you pasty faced fuckers , let' s go !
follow me .
come on , this way , that' s it !
come on .
this way , follow me .
come on , follow me .
come and get it .
it' s a running buffet .
all you can eat !
shall we go in , then ?
come on , barbara .
leave those .
i think they' re for me .
he' s been gone a good 20 minutes .
17 .
either way , we need to think about blocking up this window .
we' re totally exposed .
how will shaun get back in ?
i' m sure he' il knock .
let' s get some lights on .
david , wait !
power' s off .
that' s a good thing .
we mustn' t advertise our whereabouts .
no , of course not .
do we , david ?
no , of course not , lizzie .
i' m just being proactive .
there' s no lights , no power .
and there' s a hole in the window .
you did that , you twat .
somebody had to do something !
we were in a spot of bother .
somebody has to take control of the situation and if none of you are prepared to accept that responsibility then perhaps ...
i should .
will shaun be gone long ?
he' il be back soon .
how do you know ?
i don' t think he' d leave us .
wouldn' t he ?
how can you trust a man you binned for being unreliable ?
a man whose idea of a romantic nightspot is also an impenetrable fortress .
this is a pub !
we are in a pub !
what are we going to do ?
i could get a round in .
let' s just wait for shaun .
we' il barricade the window when he gets back .
what then ?
how long ?
days ?
weeks ?
a month ?
what are we going to eat ?
toasties !
there' s a breville out back .
great .
saved by nibbles .
must be why shaun took us here before he left .
he' s coming back !
why ?
because he promised ?
if he does , do you think his master plan will be anything more than eating peanuts ?
is he just gonna stroll in and suddenly everything' s ok ?
i don' t know , david !
i don' t know any more than you do .
but what i do know is that we' re here now and we have to make the best of it .
ed , get me a double vodka .
right you are .
i' il have a drink too .
would you like a drink , barbara ?
hello .
right , great , fuck it .
we' il have a party and get completely smashed .
we' ve got our nibbles .
we' ve got our mini cheddars .
david !
we got twiglets .
oh , look , hog lumps .
pickle !
hello , mum .
you all right ?
everybody ok ?
yeah .
any sign of john and bernie ?
no .
check upstairs ?
it' s locked .
phones ?
dead .
same as the power .
ok ...
nice of you to join us .
yeah , well , i promised , didn' t i ?
how did you lose them ?
i just gave them the slip .
wasn' t difficult .
they' re not all that .
well , how did you get in ?
the back door .
i tried to tell you before you smashed the window .
but it wasn' t me blowing our cover by arguing with my boyfriend .
he' s not my boyfriend .
might be a bit warm , the cooler' s off .
thanks , babe .
so , what' s the plan , then ?
would anyone like a peanut ?
why don' t you do your clyde ?
has anyone seen every which way but loose ?
ed does the most amazing impression of the orang utan .
no , it' s not .
it is .
come on .
do it .
no , no .
but it' s brilliant .
come on .
you' ve built it up too much .
no , just do it .
everyone wants to see it .
we could do with a laugh .
do it , do it , do it , do it .
come on , do it .
i' m not a performing monkey .
the power' s on .
it' s not , i tried it earlier .
the streetlights are on .
i' il flip the fuses , we can watch television .
what about the lights ?
yes .
don' t advertise our whereabouts .
the lights are on a separate circuit .
just flip the mains breakers .
it' s quite simple , david .
is that it ?
that' s it .
liz , erm ... have you got a quid ?
erm ...
yeah .
never anything on , is there ?
what ?
i think we might have a bit of a problem .
what do you mean ?
they followed me .
i thought you said you gave them the slip .
yeah .
well , we' il just have to be extra quiet then , won' t we ?
what ?
ed , no !
turn it off !
shit !
where the hell did he come from ?
i dunno .
who put this on ?
it' s on random .
dianne , get mum somewhere safe .
david , kill the queen .
what ? !
the jukebox !
liz , ed , grab a weapon .
what about the rifle ?
cocktails ?
what do you mean ?
the flaming spirits get a rag in , light it .
but the whole place could go up .
what , then ?
how about pool ?
# don' t stop me now
# don' t stop me
# cos i' m having ... # john , it' s time at the bar .
# i' m a shooting star leaping through the sky like a tiger
# defying the laws of gravity
# i' m a racing car passing by like lady godiva
# i' m gonna go , go , go
# there' s no stopping me
# i' m burning through the sky ...
i can' t find the switches !
then get the fuses !
# that' s why they call me mister fahrenheit
# i' m travelling at the speed of light
# i wanna make a supersonic man out of you
# don' t stop me now
# i' m having such a good time
# i' m having a ball
# don' t stop me now
# if you wanna have a good time
# just give me a call
# don' t stop me now cos i' m having a good time
# don' t stop me now
# yes i' m having a good time i don' t wanna stop at all
# i' m a rocket ship on my way to mars ...
why is queen still on ?
we have a situation !
i know !
fuck this .
two seconds .
ed !
oi !
# oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , explode
# i' m burning through the sky , yeah ...
shaun ! # ... call me mister fahrenheit ...
no !
yes !
yes !
in the head !
ooow !
shauny !
# don' t stop me ooh , ooh , ooh
# don' t stop me , don' t stop me good time , good time
# don' t stop me ... #
why didn' t you just shoot him , man ?
ed , for the last time , it' s ...
i fucking knew it !
what did i tell you ?
big al was right .
ok .
but dogs can look up .
has anyone fired a gun before ?
oh , yeah .
apart from ed ?
i' m a pacifist .
apart from david and ed ?
what was ed' s experience ?
he shot his sister in the leg .
i think you should do it .
we should all do it .
how can five people operate one gun ?
no one has any experience .
we' ve got ...
29 .
29 bullets .
call them shells .
29 shells .
i need someone to help me reload , everyone else to look out .
i will fire .
as bertrand russell said the only thing that will redeem mankind is co operation .
i think we can all appreciate that now .
was that on a beer mat ?
yeah , it was guinness extra cold .
i won' t say anything .
thanks .
they want to come in .
get mum out of the way .
david , dianne , let' s go .
ed , give me some shells .
barbara .
oh , hello .
would you like to come with me ?
that' d be lovely .
it' s nice to meet you , finally .
shaun' s always talking about you .
really ?
yeah .
ah !
barbara ?
are you all right ?
i' ve got something for you .
shaun' s father gave me this .
shaun' s real father , i mean .
i' d like you to have it .
barbara , shaun and i have ...
it seems only right .
i didn' t want to say anything .
i thought shaun would be worried .
liz !
here they come !
stay behind me !
there' s one !
sorry , we' re closed !
the safety !
that happened to me on stage .
cock it !
there !
where ?
three o' clock !
oh !
over there again .
quarter to twelve .
what ?
11 : 45 !
keep it simple !
top left !
reload .
i' m on it !
come on , come on .
nice shot .
ok , david , dianne , let' s block up this window !
ed , take over a sec .
what is it ?
what' s wrong ?
shaun , i' m so sorry .
mum , what' s wrong ?
i didn' t want to be a bother .
mum , what' s wrong ?
i didn' t want to be a bother .
mum , i don' t understand .
the man in his pyjamas .
i didn' t want to say anything , i thought you' d be upset .
no , you should' ve said .
take over a sec .
what' s going on ?
what' s up ?
what the hell' s going on ?
barbara' s hurt !
just take over a minute .
jesus .
i know first aid .
just hang on .
mum !
mum .
is she ... ?
just hold on , mum , you' re gonna be fine .
i never thanked you .
for what ?
for these .
to a wonderful mum .
it' s been a funny sort of day , hasn' t it ?
oh , no , no !
mum , come on .
stop it , stop it , stop it .
mum .
please don' t go .
what are you doing ?
we have to deal with her .
daffs !
for christ' s sake !
she' s gonna come back !
she' s not going anywhere .
she' il change .
she' s my mum !
she' s a zombie .
don' t say that .
move aside .
i' m gonna count to three .
one ... two ... three !
don' t point that gun at my mum !
calm down .
don' t point that gun at barbara !
ed , don' t exacerbate things !
what' s that mean ?
this isn' t exactly fair .
here .
thank you .
it' s ok .
please , can we just stop and think about this ?
tell him to put the gun down !
she' s gonna change .
you know i' m right .
and when she does , she' il kill all of us .
that' s what your ex can' t seem to realise .
that' s what this is about , isn' t it ?
he doesn' t like me !
he' s always hated me and now he wants to shoot my mum .
she' s not ...
you' ve never thought i was good enough .
what ?
we all know you' re in love with liz .
that is not true .
yes it is !
that is not true .
yes it is .
what ?
i know you only hung out with me to get close to liz and when she knocked you back , i was there to pick up the pieces .
i' ve come to terms with that , daffs , why can' t you ?
lizzie , i want you to know that my feelings for you ...
david !
there are slightly more pressing matters at hand here .
like " daffs " pointing a gun at my mum .
i' m not being unreasonable , " pickle " .
christ , she' s not dead !
she' s finished .
for a hero , you' re quite a hypocrite .
you' ve gone from a chartered accountant to charlton heston .
i' m not a chartered accountant .
well , you look like one .
yeah .
i' m a lecturer .
you' re a twat .
she' s not your mum .
in a minute she' il be just another zombie .
don' t say that .
we' re not using the z word .
please can we just calm the fuck down !
now , i can see what david is trying to say ...
thank you .
even if he is being a twat .
yep .
and , shaun ...
shaun , look at me .
i can' t begin to imagine how hard this must be for you but we can' t afford to fall apart .
shaun , babe ...
i know you don' t wanna hear this ...
you do it .
i' m sorry , mum .
do it !
well ...
i think we' re all agreed , you did the right thing there .
david , no !
david !
right , i' m leaving .
what ?
i' m not staying here .
david , it' s suicide .
i think you should go .
we will .
we can defend ourselves .
what do you mean " we " ?
what do you mean ?
opening that door now would be a very silly thing to do .
you gonna stay here with him ?
look ...
after where he led us ?
let me finish !
shaun didn' t ask you to come here .
you came for the same reason i did .
get away from that door this instant !
but ...
david !
i' m so sorry , dianne .
maybe i' m not the one you should be apologising to .
shaun ...
david !
no !
no !
no !
no !
david !
no !
no !
david !
david !
dianne , no !
i' m coming , david !
david !
oh dear .
cocktails ?

stay back !
shaun , hold them !
heads !
ed !
hurry up !
shauny , look who it is .
fuck a doodle doo !
ed !
shaun !
ed !
don' t groan at me , you thick fuck !
i can' t hold them !
no !
shaun !
pete !
i said leave him alone !
ed .
ed !
shaun , bar !
ed !
ed !
ed !

chuck us a cloth , will you ?
where are the shells ?
they' re on the bar .
oh , fuck .
ow !
fuck it !
what are we gonna do ?
where are we gonna go ?
the cellar .
maybe we can get out !
there' s a hatch out on to the street .
you mean go back outside ?
oh , give us a fucking break !
go !
i can see the street .
come on .
come on !
why won' t it open ?
that' s it then , we' re trapped .
hey , let' s go to the winchester !
whose fucking idea was that ?
man , i' ve really ballsed this up .
no , you haven' t .
i have , liz .
i couldn' t save us .
i couldn' t save di or david .
i couldn' t even save mum .
i' m useless .
you shouldn' t feel so responsible , you tried .
you did something , that' s what counts .
yeah , i suppose .
do you think they' il get through ?
yeah .
how many shells have we got left ?
erm ... two .
i suppose we could take a few of them out if they stand in a line .
i wasn' t thinking about them .
i know .
what about ed ?
there' s only two shells .
i don' t mind being eaten .
how are we gonna do this ?
i don' t know .
erm ...
one of us has to go first .
one should do the other and then do themselves .
you should do me .
i' il muck it up if i have to do myself .
i don' t think i' ve got it in me to shoot my flatmate , my mum and my girlfriend all in the same evening .
what makes you think i' ve taken you back ?
well ... you don' t want to die single , do you ?
actually ...
i would like to be shot .
besides , i' ve changed .
i haven' t had a fag since yesterday , i promise .
he hasn' t .
maybe we should have one now .
you left them in my flat .
yeah , in the bin .
i was desperate .
sneaky monkey .
sorry .
i won' t say anything .
come on , we' re getting out of here .
i mightjust stay here .
but we can get out .
you two should make a go of it .
what are you talking about ?
i only hold you back .
yeah , but ...
maybe you should have this .
don' t you want it ?
no .
i can' t hit anything with it anyway , i' m rubbish .
ed , i' m sorry .
what for ?
cos i was shouting at you earlier on .
it' s all right .
i' m sorry too .
it' s ok .
no ...
i' m sorry , shaun .
oh , god !
that' s not funny .
i' il stop doing ' em when you stop laughing .
i' m not laughing .
you' d better be off .
bye , ed .
love you .
cheers .
i love you too , man .
gay .
ready ?
