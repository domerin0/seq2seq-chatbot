you know , just last week , i was reading in a very important medical journal ... ... that some children are allergic to chocolate .
makes their noses itch .
maybe i' m not allergic .
i could try a piece .
really ?
but why take a chance ?
mr. wonka ?
mr. wonka ?
we' re headed for a tunnel .
oh , yeah .
full speed ahead .
how can they see where they' re going ?
they can' t .
there' s no knowing where they' re going .
switch on the lights !
people , keep an eye out .
we' re passing some very important rooms here .
what do you use hair cream for ?
to lock in moisture .
whipped cream .
precisely .
that doesn' t make sense .
for your information , little girl ... ... whipped cream isn' t whipped cream at all unless it' s been whipped with whips .
everybody knows that .
stop the boat .
i wanna show you guys something .
now , this is the most important room in the entire factory .
now , everyone , enjoy yourselves , but just don' t touch anything .
okay ?
go on .
go on , scoot .
hey , mr. wonka , what' s this ?
let me show you .
thank you .
these are everlasting gobstoppers .
they' re for children who are given very little allowance .
you can suck on it all year , and it' il never get any smaller .
lsn' t that neat ?
it' s like gum .
no .
gum is for chewing .
if you tried chewing one of these gobstoppers ... ... you' d break all your little teeth off .
but they sure do taste terrific .
and this is hair toffee .
you suck down one of these little boogers ... ... and in exactly half an hour ... ... a brand new crop of hair will grow out over the top of your little noggin .
and a mustache .
and a beard .
who wants a beard ?
well ... ... beatniks , for one .
folk singers and motorbike riders .
you know , all those hip , jazzy , super cool , neat , keen and groovy cats .
it' s in the fridge , daddy o .
are you hep to the jive ?
can you dig what i' m laying down ?
i knew you could .
slide me some skin , soul brother .
unfortunately , the mixture isn' t right yet .
because an oompa loompa tried some yesterday , and , well , he
how are you today ?
you look great .
watch this .
you mean that' s it ?
do you even know what " it " is ?
it' s gum .
yeah .
it' s a stick of the most amazing and sensational gum in the whole universe .
know why ?
know why ?
because this gum is a full three course dinner all by itself .
why would anyone want that ?
it will be the end of all kitchens and all cooking .
just a little strip of wonka' s magic chewing gum and that is all you will ... ... ever need at breakfast , lunch and dinner .
this piece of gum happens to be tomato soup , roast beef and blueberry pie .
it sounds great .
it sounds weird .
it sounds like my kind of gum .
i' d rather you didn' t .
there are still some things that are
i' m the world record holder in chewing gum .
i' m not afraid of anything .
how is it , honey ?
it' s amazing !
tomato soup .
i can feel it running down my throat .
yeah .
spit it out .
young lady , i think you' d better  it' s changing .
roast beef , with baked potato .
crispy skin and butter .
keep chewing .
my little girl' s gonna be the first person to have a chewing gum meal .
yeah .
i' m just a little concerned about the
blueberry pie and ice cream !
that part .
what' s happening to her nose ?
it' s turning blue .
your whole nose has gone purple .
what do you mean ?
violet , you' re turning violet .
what' s happening ?
well , i told you i hadn' t quite got it right .
because it goes a little funny when it gets to the dessert .
it' s the blueberry pie that does it .
i' m terribly sorry .
mother ?
what' s happening to me ?
she' s swelling up .
like a blueberry .
i' ve tried it on , like , 20 oompa loompas , and each one ended up as a blueberry .
it' s just weird .
but i can' t have a blueberry as a daughter .
how is she supposed to compete ?
you could put her in a county fair .
yeah , yeah
yeah
listen close , and listen hard
to the tale of violet beauregarde
this gentle girl she sees no wrong
in chewing , chewing , chewing , chewing
chewing , chewing all day long
chewing , chewing all day long
chewing , chewing all day long
chewing , chewing all day long
yeah
she goes on chewing till , at last
her chewing muscles grow so vast
and from her face her giant chin
sticks out just like a violin
chewing , chewing all day long
chewing , chewing all day long
chewing , chewing all day long
for years and years she chews away
her jaws get stronger every day
and with one great , tremendous chew
they bite the poor girl' s tongue in two
and that is why we try so hard
to save miss violet beauregarde
chewing , chewing all day long
chewing , chewing all day long
chewing , chewing , chewing , chewing
chewing , chewing all day long
chewing , chewing all day long
chewing , chewing all day long
chewing , chewing all day long
mr. wonka !
i want you to roll miss beauregarde into the boat ... ... and take her along to the juicing room at once , okay ?
juicing room ?
what are they gonna do to her there ?
they' re gonna squeeze her .
like a little pimple .
we gotta squeeze all that juice out of her immediately .
mother , help me .
please .
come on .
let' s boogie .
without the boat , we' il have to move double time to keep on schedule .
there' s far too much to see .
mr. wonka ?
yeah ?
why did you decide to let people in ?
so they could see the factory , of course .
but why now ?
and why only five ?
what' s the special prize , and who gets it ?
the best kind of prize is a surprise .
will violet always be a blueberry ?
no .
maybe .
i don' t know .
that' s what you get from chewing gum all day .
it' s disgusting .
if you hate gum so much , why do you make it ?
once again , you shouldn' t mumble .
it' s starting to bum me out .
can you remember the first candy you ever ate ?
no .
in fact , willy wonka did remember the first candy he ever ate .
i' m sorry , i was having a flashback .
i see .
these flashbacks happen often ?
increasingly ... ... today .
this is a room i know all about .
for you see , mr. wonka , i , myself , am in the nut business .
are you using the havermax 4000 to do your sorting ?
no .
you' re really weird .
squirrels .
yeah .
squirrels .
these squirrels are specially trained to get the nuts out of shells .
why use squirrels ?
why not use oompa loompas ?
because only squirrels can get the whole walnut out almost every single time .
see how they tap them with their knuckles to make sure it' s not bad ?
oh , look .
look .
i think that one' s got a bad nut .
daddy , i want a squirrel .
get me one of those squirrels .
i want one .
veruca , dear , you have many marvelous pets .
all i' ve got at home is one pony and two dogs and four cats and six bunny rabbits ... ... and two parakeets and three canaries and a green parrot and a turtle ... ... and a silly old hamster .
i want a squirrel !
all right , pet .
daddy will get you a squirrel as soon as he possibly can .
but i don' t want any old squirrel , i want a trained squirrel .
very well .
mr. wonka , how much do you want for one of these squirrels ?
name your price .
oh , they' re not for sale .
she can' t have one .
daddy .
i' m sorry , darling .
mr. wonka' s being unreasonable .
if you won' t get me a squirrel , i' il get one myself .
veruca .
little girl ?
veruca , come back here at once .
veruca .
little girl ?
don' t touch that squirrel' s nuts .
it' il make him crazy .
i' il have you .
veruca .
veruca .
no !
veruca !
let' s find the key .
nope .
not that one .
daddy !
veruca !
no .
it' s not that one .
there it is .
there it isn' t .
daddy , i want them to stop .
what are they doing ?
they' re testing to see if she' s a bad nut .
oh , my goodness .
she is a bad nut after all .
veruca !
daddy !
where are they taking her ?
where all the other bad nuts go .
to the garbage chute .
where does the chute go ?
to the incinerator .
but don' t worry .
we only light it on tuesdays .
today is tuesday .
well , there' s always the chance they decided not to light it today .
now , she may be stuck in the chute just below the top .
if that' s the case , all you have to do is just reach in and pull her out .
okay ?
veruca salt , the little brute
has just gone down the garbage chute
and she will meet , as she descends
a rather different set of friends
a rather different set of friends
a rather different set of friends
a fish head , for example , cut
this morning from a halibut
an oyster from an oyster stew
a steak that no one else would chew
and lots of other things as well
each with its rather horrid smell
horrid smell
these are veruca ' s newfound friends
that she will meet as she descends
these are veruca ' s newfound friends
who went and spoiled her , who indeed ?
who pandered to her every need ?
who turned her into such a brat ?
who are the culprits ?
who did that ?
the guilty ones , now this is sad
are dear old mum and loving dad
oh , really ?
oh , good .
i' ve just been informed that the incinerator' s broken .
so there should be about three weeks of rotten garbage to break their fall .
well , that' s good news .
yeah .
well , let' s keep on trucking .
i don' t know why i didn' t think of this .
the elevator' s by far the most efficient way to get around the factory .
there can' t be this many floors .
how do you know , mr. smarty pants ?
this isn' t just an ordinary up and down elevator , by the way .
this elevator can go sideways , longways , slantways ... ... and any other ways you can think of .
you just press any button and , whoosh , you' re off .
oh , look .
look .
ladies and gentlemen , welcome to fudge mountain .
i' d rather not talk about this one .
this is the puppet hospital and burn center .
it' s relatively new .
the administration offices .
hello , doris .
why is everything here completely pointless ?
candy doesn' t have to have a point .
that' s why it' s candy .
it' s stupid .
candy is a waste of time .
no son of mine is going to be a chocolatier .
then i' il run away .
to switzerland .
bavaria .
the candy capitals of the world .
go ahead .
but i won' t be here when you come back .
sorry , son .
we' re closing for the night .
i wanna pick a room .
go ahead .
here .
put these on quick , and don' t take them off whatever you do .
this light could burn your eyeballs right out of your skulls .
and we certainly don' t want that , now , do we ?
television chocolate .
hey , if television can break up a photograph ... ... into millions and millions of tiny pieces and send it whizzing through the air ... ... then reassemble it on the other end ... ... why can' t i do the same with chocolate ?
why can' t i send a real bar of chocolate through the television , ready to be eaten ?
i' m not gonna touch it .
i' m not going in that direction .
sounds impossible .
it is impossible .
you don' t understand anything about science .
first off , there' s a difference between waves and particles .
second , the amount of power it would take to convert energy in matter ... ... would be like nine atomic bombs .
mumbler !
seriously , i cannot understand a single word you' re saying .
okey dokey .
i shall now send a bar of chocolate from one end of the room ... ... to the other by television .
bring in the chocolate .
it' s gotta be real big because you know how on tv ... ... you can film a regular size man , and he comes out looking this tall ?
same basic principle .
it' s gone .
told you .
that bar of chocolate is now rushing through the air above our heads ... ... in a million tiny little pieces .
come over here .
come on .
come on .
come on !
watch the screen .
here it comes .
oh , look .
take it .
it' s just a picture on a screen .
scaredy cat .
you take it .
go on .
just reach out and grab it .
go on .
holy buckets .
eat it .
go on .
it' il be delicious .
it' s the same bar .
it' s just gotten a little smaller on the journey , that' s all .
it' s great .
it' s a miracle .
wonka' s chocolates are the best in the world .
if you don' t believe us , try one for yourself .
and you simply reach out and take it .
how about that ?
so can you send other things ?
say , like , breakfast cereal ?
do you have any idea what breakfast cereal' s made of ?
it' s those little curly wooden shavings you find in pencil sharpeners .
but could you send it by tv if you wanted to ?
of course i could .
what about people ?
well , why would i wanna send a person ?
they don' t taste very good at all .
don' t you realize what you' ve invented ?
it' s a teleporter .
it' s the most important invention in the history of the world .
and all you think about is chocolate .
calm down , mike .
i think mr. wonka knows what he' s talking about .
no , he doesn' t .
he has no idea .
you think he' s a genius , but he' s an idiot .
but i' m not .
hey , little boy .
don' t push my button .
he' s gone .
let' s go check the television , see what we get .
i sure hope no part of him gets left behind .
what do you mean ?
well , sometimes only half of the little pieces find their way through .
if you had to choose only one half of your son , which one would it be ?
what kind of a question is that ?
no need to snap .
just a question .
try every channel .
i' m starting to feel a little anxious .
there he is .
mike .
the most important thing
that we' ve ever learned
the most important thing we' ve learned as far as children are concerned
is never , never let them near the television set
or better still just don ' t install the idiotic thing at all
never , never let them never , never let them
never , never let them
never , never let them
it rots the senses in the head
it keeps imagination dead
it clogs and clutters up the mind
it makes a child so dull and blind
so dull , so dull
he can no longer understand a fairy tale , a fairyland
a fairyland , a fairyland
his brain becomes as soft as cheese
his thinking powers rust and freeze
he cannot think , he only sees
regarding little mike teavee
we very much regret that we
regret that we
shall simply have to wait and see
wait and see , wait and see
wait and see , wait and see , wait and see
we very much regret that we
shall simply have to wait and see
if we can get him back his height
but if we can ' t
it serves him right
somebody grab him .
help me .
help me .
oh , thank heavens .
he' s completely unharmed .
unharmed ?
what are you talking about ?
just put me back in the other way .
there is no other way .
it' s television , not telephone .
there' s quite a difference .
and what exactly do you propose to do about it ?
i don' t know .
but young men are extremely springy .
they stretch like mad .
let' s go put him in the taffy puller .
taffy puller ?
hey , that was my idea .
boy , is he gonna be skinny .
yeah .
taffy puller .
i want you to take mr. teavee and his ... ... iittle boy up to the taffy puller , okay ?
stretch him out .
on with the tour .
there' s still so much left to see .
now , how many children are left ?
mr. wonka , charlie' s the only one left now .
you mean , you' re the only one ?
yes .
what happened to the others ?
oh , my dear boy , but that means you' ve won .
oh , i do congratulate you .
i really do .
i' m absolutely delighted .
i had a hunch right from the beginning .
well done .
now , we mustn' t dilly or dally .
we have an enormous number of things to do before the day' s out .
but luckily for us , we have the great glass elevator to speed things along
speed things along .
come on .
up and out " ?
what kind of room is that ?
hold on .
oh , my goodness .
we' re gonna need to go much faster , otherwise we' il just never break through .
break through what ?
i' ve been longing to press that button for years .
well , here we go .
up and out .
but do you really mean ?
yeah .
i do .
but it' s made of glass .
it' il smash into a million pieces .
augustus , please don' t eat your fingers .
but i taste so good .
look , mother .
i' m much more flexible now .
yes , but you' re blue .
daddy , i want a flying glass elevator .
veruca , the only thing you' re getting today is a bath , and that' s final .
but i want it .
where do you live ?
right over there .
that little house .
what time do you think they' il be back ?
hard to know , dear .
i think there' s someone at the door .
hi , mom .
mom .
dad .
we' re back .
charlie .
charlie .
goodness .
this is willy wonka .
he gave us a ride home .
i see that .
you must be the boy' s
parents ?
yeah .
that .
he says charlie' s won something .
not just some something .
the most " something " something of any something that' s ever been .
i' m gonna give this little boy my entire factory .
you must be joking .
no , really .
it' s true .
because you see , a few months ago , i was having my semiannual haircut ... ... and i had the strangest revelation .
in that one silver hair ... ... i saw reflected my life' s work ... ... my factory , my beloved oompa loompas .
who would watch over them after i was gone ?
i must find a heir .
and i did , charlie .
you .
that' s why you sent out the golden tickets .
what are oompa loompas ?
i invited five children to the factory ... ... and the one who was the least rotten would be the winner .
that' s you , charlie .
so , what do you say ?
are you ready to leave all this behind and come live with me at the factory ?
sure .
of course .
i mean , it' s all right if my family come too ?
oh , my dear boy , of course they can' t .
you can' t run a chocolate factory ... ... with a family hanging over you like an old , dead goose .
no offense .
none taken , jerk .
a chocolatier has to run free and solo .
he has to follow his dreams .
gosh darn the consequences .
look at me .
i had no family , and i' m a giant success .
so if i go with you to the factory , i won' t ever see my family again ?
yeah .
consider that a bonus .
then i' m not going .
i wouldn' t give up my family for anything .
not for all the chocolate in the world .
oh , i see .
that' s weird .
there' s other candy too besides chocolate .
i' m sorry , mr. wonka .
i' m staying here .
well , that' s just ... ... unexpected ... ... and weird .
but i suppose , in that case , i' il just
goodbye , then .
sure you won' t change your mind ?
i' m sure .
okay .
bye .
things are going to get much better .
and for once , grandma georgina knew exactly what she was talking about .
the next morning , charlie helped his parents fix the hole in the roof .
grandpa joe spent the whole day out of bed .
he didn ' t feel tired at all .
charlie ' s father got a better job at the toothpaste factory ... ... repairing the machine that had replaced him .
things had never been better for the bucket family .
the same could not be said for willy wonka .
i can' t put my finger on it .
candy' s the only thing i was ever certain of ... ... and now i' m just not certain at all .
i don' t know which flavors to make or which ideas to try .
i' m second guessing myself , which is nuts .
i' ve always made whatever candy i felt like , and l
that' s just it , isn' t it ?
i make the candy i feel like , but now i feel terrible , so the candy' s terrible .
you' re very good .
pity about that chocolate fellow , wendell walter .
willy wonka .
that' s the one .
says here in the paper his new candies aren' t selling very well .
but i suppose maybe he' s just a rotten egg who deserves it .
yep .
oh , really ?
you ever met him ?
i did .
i thought he was great at first , but then he didn' t turn out so nice .
he also has a funny haircut .
i do not !
why are you here ?
i don' t feel so hot .
what makes you feel better when you feel terrible ?
my family .
what do you have against my family ?
it' s not just your family .
it' s the whole idea of
they tell you what to do , what not to do ... ... and it' s not conducive to a creative atmosphere .
usually they' re just trying to protect you because they love you .
if you don' t believe me , you should ask .
ask who ?
my father ?
no way .
at least , not by myself .
you want me to go with you ?
hey .
hey , what a good idea .
yeah !
and you know what ?
i' ve got transport
i have to be more careful where i park this thing .
i think we' ve got the wrong house .
do you have an appointment ?
no .
but he' s overdue .
open .
now , let' s see what the damage is , shall we ?
heavens .
i haven' t seen bicuspids like these since ....
since ....
willy ?
hi , dad .
all these years ... ... and you haven' t flossed .
not once .
it was on this day that willy wonka repeated his offer to charlie ... ... who accepted on one condition .
sorry we' re late .
we were brainstorming .
thought i heard thunder .
you staying for dinner , willy ?
yes , please .
i' il shuffle the plates .
you smell like peanuts .
i love peanuts .
oh , thank you .
you smell like ... ... old people and soap .
i like it .
elbows off the table , charlie .
how do you feel about little raspberry kites ?
with licorice instead of string .
boys , no business at the dinner table .
sorry , mom .
i think you' re on to something , though , charlie .
in the end , charlie bucket won a chocolate factory .
a family .
life had never been sweeter .
