get a grip on yourself , will you ?

mr. mcmurphy' s here , doc .
good , have him come in .
thank you .
mcmurphy , i' m dr. spivey .
dr. spivey , what a pleasure it is to meet you .
sure .
pull up a chair , sit down and let' s talk .
sure .
r. p. mcmurphy .
that' s a hell of a fish there , doc .
isn' t that a dandy ?
yeah .
it' s about 40 pounds , ain' t it ?
no , 32 .
thirty two .
but i' il tell you , it took every bit of strength i had ... ... to hold it while the guy took the picture .
every damn bit .
probably that chain didn' t help it any , either .
you didn' t weigh the chain , did you ?
no , i didn' t weigh the chain .
but , i' m awful proud of that picture .
that' s the first chinooker i ever caught .
it' s a nice one .
randall patrick mcmurphy .
38 years old .
what can you tell me about ... ... why you' ve been sent over here ?
well ...
i don' t know .
what' s it say there ?
mind if i smoke ?
no , go right ahead .
well , it ... ... says several things here .
it said you' ve been belligerent .
talked when unauthorized .
you' ve been resentful in attitude towards work , in general .
that you' re lazy .
chewing gum in class .
the real reason you' ve been sent here ... ... is because they wanted you to be evaluated .
to determine whether or not you' re mentally ill .
this is the real reason .
why do you think they might think that ?
well , as near as i can figure out , it' s because i ... ... fight and fuck too much .
in the penitentiary ?
no , you mean why ...
why did you get sent over here ... ... from the work farm ?
well , i really don' t know , doc .
it says here that you went around ...
let me just take a look ...
it ain' t up to me .
one ... ... two , three ... ... four ...
you' ve got at least ... ... five arrests for assault .
what can you tell me about that ?
five fights , huh ?
rocky marciano has 40 , and he' s a millionaire .
that' s true .
that is true .
of course , it' s true that you went in for ... ... statutory rape .
that' s true , is it not , this time ?
absolutely true .
but , doc ... ... she was 15 years old going on 35 , doc ... ... and she told me she was 18 , and she was ... ... very willing , you know what i mean ?
i practically had to take to sewing my pants shut .
but between you and me ... ... she might have been 15 .
when you get that little red beaver ... ... right there in front of you , i don' t think it' s crazy at all .
i don' t think you do either .
i hear what you' re saying .
no man alive could resist that .
that' s why i got into jail to begin with .
now they' re telling me i' m crazy over here ... ... because i don' t sit there like a goddamn vegetable .
it don' t make a bit of sense to me .
if that' s what being crazy is ... ... then i' m senseless , out of it , gone down the road , whacko .
but , no more , no less .
that' s it .
to be honest with you , mcmurphy ... ... what it says here ... ... is that they think ...
they think ... ... you' ve been faking it in order to get out of your work detail .
what do you think about that ?
do i look like that kind of guy to you ?
let' s just be frank for a minute .
randall , if you would .
tell me ...
do you think there' s anything wrong with your mind , really ?
not a thing , doc .
i' m a goddamn marvel of modern science .
you' re going to be here for a period , for us to evaluate you .
we' re going to study you .
we' il make our determinations as to what we' re going to do ... ... and give you the necessary treatment as indicated .
doc , let me just tell you this .
i' m here to cooperate with you 100 percent .
100 percent .
i' il be just right down the line with you .
you watch .
because i think we ought to get to the bottom of ... ... r. p. mcmurphy .
the scythe .
i' m awfully tired .
sit down .
god , i' m tired .
sit down .
is that better ?
mr. ellsworth ... ... you' il wear yourself out .
all right , gentlemen , let' s begin .
at the close of friday' s meeting ... ... we were discussing mr. harding' s problem concerning his wife .
mr. harding stated that his wife made him uneasy ... ... because she drew stares from men on the street .
is that correct , mr. harding ?
yes .
that' s correct .
he also thinks he may have given her reason ... ... to seek sexual attention elsewhere , but he wasn' t able to say how .
i hate you .
i don' t ever want to see you again .
you' ve betrayed me .
so , does anyone care to touch on this further ?
mr. scanlon , would you begin today ?
are you sure ?
billy , how about you ?
no , ma' am .
i' d like to write in my book that you began the meeting .
just once .
mr. martini ?
are you with us ?
yes .
would you like to begin ?
mr. cheswick ?
me ?
yes .
you mean there' s not a man here who has an opinion on this matter ?
all right .
mr. harding ... ... you' ve stated on more than one occasion ... ... that you' ve suspected your wife of seeing other men .
oh , yes .
yes , very much , i suspect her .
i suspect her .
maybe you can tell us why ... ... you suspect her .
well , i can only ... ... speculate as to the reasons why .
have you ever speculated , mr. harding ... ... that perhaps you are ... ... impatient with your wife ... ... because she doesn' t meet your mental requirements ?
perhaps .
but you see , the only thing i can really ... ... speculate on , nurse ratched ... ... is the very existence of my life ... ... with or without my wife ... ... in terms of the human relationships , the juxtaposition of ... ... one person to another , the form , the content .
harding , why don' t you knock off the bullshit and get to the point ?
this is the point .
this is the point , taber .
it' s not bullshit .
i' m not just talking about my wife , i' m talking about my life !
i can' t seem to get that through to you .
i' m not just talking about one person , i' m talking about everybody !
i' m talking about form !
i' m talking about content !
i' m talking about interrelationships !
i' m talking about god , the devil , hell , heaven !
do you understand ?
finally ?
yeah , harding , you' re so fucking dumb i can' t believe it .
it makes me feel very peculiar , very peculiar ... ... when you throw in something like that .
why ?
what does that mean , " peculiar " ?
peculiar ?
peculiar ?
i' m going to tell you guys something .
you just don' t want to learn anything .
you just don' t want to listen to anybody .
he' s got intelligence !
you' ve never heard the word " peculiar " ?
say , what are you trying to say ?
you trying to say i' m queer ?
is that it ?
little mary ann ?
little marjorie jane ?
is that what you' re trying to tell me ?
is that your idea of communicating something to me ?
well , is it ?
they' re all crowding in on you , mr. harding .
they' re all ganging up on you .
is that news ?
they sometimes want to gang up on me , too , but i ...
cheswick , do me a favor .
take it easy .
and stay off my side .
but i only want to ...
i only want to help you .
i understand .
but don' t you want me to ...
please !
but i only want to ...
please !
but i only want to help you .
please !
you see ... ... the other day you made some allusions , both of you . illusions ?
yes , allusions .
not illusions .
allusions ... ... to sexual problems i might be having with my wife .
let' s say it' s true !
let' s say i know it' s true , but you don' t !
if that' s your idea of trying to tell me something ...
you know , harding , i think you' re some kind of morbid asshole !
peculiar !
" asshole " again .
it makes you feel " peculiar " .
you' ve talked about your wife ever since i can remember !
you know , she' s on your mind , and blah , blah ...
i' m not talking about my wife !
when will you get that through your thick head ?
when are you going to wise up and turn her loose ?
please !
i don' t want to hear it !
i' m tired .
i don' t want to hear it !
i' m tired .
i don' t want to hear it .
i don' t want to hear it .
it' s a lot of baloney and i' m tired .
i don' t want to hear it !
we know you' re tired .
we' re all tired .
i' m tired and it' s a lot of baloney .
you' re not tired , bancini .
take your hands off me !

the patients are not allowed in the nurses ' station .
all right ?
yes , ma' am .
let me get in here , will you , hard on ?
thank you .
excuse me , miss .
do you think it might be possible to turn the music down ... ... so maybe a couple of the boys could talk ?
that music is for everyone , mr. mcmurphy .
i know , but do you think we might ease it down a little ... ... so maybe the boys didn' t have to shout ?
what you probably don' t realize ... ... is that we have a lot of old men in this ward ... ... who couldn' t hear the music if we turned it lower .
that music is all they have .
your hand is staining my window .
i' m sorry , ma' am .
all right .
mr. mcmurphy , your medication .
what' s in the horse pill ?
it' s just medicine .
it' s good for you .
yeah , but i don' t like the idea of taking something if i don' t know what it is .
don' t get upset , mr. mcmurphy .
i' m not getting upset , miss pilbow .
it' s just that i don' t want anyone to try and slip me saltpeter .
you know what i mean ?
it' s all right , nurse pilbow .
if mr. mcmurphy doesn' t want to take his medication orally ... ... i' m sure we can arrange that he can have it some other way .
but i don' t think you' d like it , mr. mcmurphy .
you' d like it , wouldn' t you , hard on ?
give it to me .
good .
very good !
yummy !
mr. harding ?
merci .
tell me , lover boy ... ... why didn' t you tell her to go fuck herself ?
jesus christ .
funny , huh ?
that' s funny , huh ?
you know that wasn' t very smart .
she could have seen that .
god almighty , she' s got you guys coming and going .
what do you think she is ?
some kind of a champ or something ?
no , i thought you were the champ .
you want to bet ?

i bet in one week i can put a bug so far up her ass ... ... she won' t know whether to shit or wind her wrist watch .

last time we were discussing ... ... mr. harding and the problem with his wife ... ... and i think we were making a lot of progress .
so who would like to begin today ?
mr. mcmurphy ?
i' ve been thinking about what you said about ... ... you know , getting things off your chest .
well , there' s a couple of things that i' d like to get off my chest .
well , that' s very good , mr. mcmurphy .
go ahead .
today , as you may or may not know , it doesn' t matter ... ... is the opening of the world series .
what i' d like to suggest is that we change the work detail tonight ... ... so that we can watch the ball game .
well , mr. mcmurphy , what you' re asking ... ... is that we change a very carefully worked out schedule .
a little change never hurt , huh ?
a little variety ?
well , it' s not necessarily true , mr. mcmurphy .
some men on the ward take a long , long time to get used to the schedule .
change it now , and they might find it very disturbing .
fuck the schedule !
they can go back to the schedule after the series .
i' m talking about the world series , nurse ratched .
well , anyway , this is no way to proceed about this .
how would it be if we had a vote ... ... and let the majority rule ?
great .
let' s vote on it .
so , all those in favor raise your hands .
okay , guys , come on .
put your hands up .
what' s the matter with you ?
don' t you want to watch the world series ?
get your hands up .
it can do you some good ... ... to get some exercise , putting your arms up in the air .
that' s it .
come on , let' s ...
what is this crap ?
i watch the series .
i haven' t missed the series in years .
even in the cooler .
when i' m in the cooler they run it there or they' il have a riot .
what' s the matter with you guys ?
come on , be good americans !
well , mr. mcmurphy , i only count three votes , and ... ... that' s not enough to change the ward policy .
i' m sorry .
my turn .
okay , hot dice .
i want a ten to go ... ... because i need cash .
i want to get to mediterranean avenue .
big ten !
perfect .
two fives .
what are you doing ?
hotel .
you do not have a hotel there .
hotel .
for the third time ... ... you do not have a hotel on boardwalk .
hotel .
it costs $1, 000 and four green houses ... ... to put a hotel on boardwalk .
hotel .
play the game and knock off the bullshit .
play the game .
what are you talking about ?
i am .
play the game !
i ain' t doing anything to you !
what bullshit ?
your bullshit !
what about your bullshit ?
play !
you keep your hands off me !
play the game !
i' ve had enough bullshit from you !
play the game .
what are you picking on me for ?
play the game , harding .
i' m trying to ignore you , see ?
just play the game .
keep your hands off me , you son of a bitch !
keep your hands off me !
you hear me ?
come on , come on .
i can be pushed just so far , see !
play the game .
you touch me once more .
just touch me once more !
just once more , huh ?
just once more !
just touch me once more !
play the game , harding !
just touch me once more !
holy jesus !
is that what your schedule does for you , hard on ?
goddamn lunatic !
i don' t know what you' re talking about .
no ?
well , then stay all wet , harding , huh ?
because i' m going downtown to watch the world series , anyway .
anybody want to come with me ?
i do , mac .
i want to go with you !
ches , all right .
anybody else ?
where ?
any bar downtown .
mac , you can' t ... ... get out of here .
anybody want to bet ?
chicken shits !
maybe he' il just show nurse ratched his big thing ... ... and she' il open the door for him .
yeah , maybe i will ... ... and then maybe i' il use your thick skull and knock a hole in the wall .
sefelt , see ?
why ?
my head would squash like an eggplant .
fuck sefelt' s head , i don' t need sefelt' s head !
i' il take this thing , and put it through the window ... ... and me and cheswick will go out through the hall ... ... downtown , sit down in a bar , wet our whistles ... ... and watch the ball game .
and that' s the bet .
now , does anybody want any of it ?
you' re going to lift that thing ?
yeah !
that' s right .
i' il bet a buck .
taber , $1 .
i bet a dime .
mac , you can' t ... ... lift that thing .
anybody else want any of it ?
hard on ?
i' il bet $25 ! $25 , hard on !
mac , nobody could ever lift that thing .
get out of my way , son .
you' re using my oxygen .
you know what i mean ?
all right .
all right .
giving up ?
no !
just warming up .
warming up .
this will be the one .
all right , baby .
but i tried , didn' t i ?
goddamn it !
at least i did that .
and on the mound , the left hander , al downing .
the two pitchers still warming up , right down below us .
the second game of the 1963 " world series " ... ... is being brought to you from yankee stadium .
did you tell the girl how you felt about her ?
i went over to her house ... ... one sunday afternoon and ... ... and i brought her some flowers ...
celia , will you ...
... marry me ?
why did you want to marry her ?
well , i was in love with her .
your mother told me that you never told her about it .
why didn' t you tell her about it ?
wasn' t that the first time you tried to commit suicide ?
oh , my god !
yes , mr. cheswick ?
miss ratched ... ... i' d like to ask you a question , please .
go ahead .
okay .
you know , if billy doesn' t feel like talking ... ... i mean , why are you pressing him ?
why can' t we go on to some new business ?
the business of this meeting , mr. cheswick ... ... is therapy .
you know , i don' t understand this , miss ratched ... ... because i don' t ...
mr. mcmurphy ... ... said something yesterday about a world series .
a baseball game ?
you know , and i' ve never been to a baseball game and ... ... i think i' d like to see one .
that would be good therapy , too , wouldn' t it , miss ratched ?
i thought we' d decided that issue .
i don' t think so , because , i mean ... ... we discussed that yesterday ... ... and we have a new game today , i think , don' t we , mac ?
that' s right , ches , and we want a new vote on it , don' t we ?
would one more vote satisfy you , mr. mcmurphy ?
yeah .
it' il satisfy me .
there' s a vote before the group .
everyone in favor of changing the schedule , please raise your hand .
okay , i want to see the hands .
come on !
which one of you nuts has got any guts ?
all right .
that' s it !
i only count nine votes , mr. mcmurphy .
she only counts nine .
only nine !
it' s a landslide .
there are 18 patients on this ward , mr. mcmurphy ... ... and you have to have a majority to change ward policy .
so you gentlemen can put your hands down now .
are you trying to tell me that you' re going to count these ?
these poor sons of bitches , they don' t know what we' re talking about .
well , i have to disagree with you , mr. mcmurphy .
these men are members of the ward , just as you are .
all right .
all i need is one vote , right ?

miss ratched is one of the finest nurses we' ve got in this institution .
well , i don' t want to break up the meeting or nothing ... ... but she' s something of a cunt , ain' t she , doc ?
how do you mean that ?
she likes a rigged game , you know what i mean ?
well , you know , i' ve been observing you here now ... ... for the last four weeks ... ... and i don' t see any evidence of mental illness , at all .

is that it ?
is that crazy enough for you ?
want me to take a shit on the floor ?
christ !
have you ever heard the old saying , " a rolling stone gathers no moss " ?
yeah .
does that mean something to you ?
it' s the same as " don' t wash your dirty underwear in public .
i' m not sure i understand what you mean .
i' m smarter than him , ain' t i ?
well that , sort of , has always meant ... ... it' s hard for something to grow on something that' s moving .
how did you feel about what happened yesterday ?
you want to kill .
you know what i mean ?
do you gentlemen have any more questions ?
i don' t have any more , but perhaps you do .

he' s not crazy ... ... but he' s dangerous .
you don' t think he' s crazy ?
no , he' s not crazy .
dr. songee ?
i don' t think he' s overly psychotic .
but i still think he' s quite sick .
do you think he' s dangerous ?
absolutely so .
well , john , what do you want to do with him ?
i think we' ve had our turn .
i' d like to send him back to the work farm , frankly .
is there anybody that you have ... ... on your staff , that could ... ... relate to him ?
maybe understand him .
help him out with some of these problems ?
the funny thing is that the person he' s the closest to ... ... is the one he dislikes the most .
that' s you , mildred .
well , gentlemen , in my opinion , if we send him back to pendleton or ... ... we send him up to disturbed ... ... it' s just one more way of passing on our problem to somebody else .
you know , we don' t like to do that .
so i' d like to keep him on the ward .
i think we can help him .
chief , chief , come on .
come with me , huh ?

hey , damn it !

i' il be seeing you on the outside .
you know what i mean ?
by the time you get out of here ... ... you' il be too old to even get it up .
sixty eight days , buddy .
sixty eight days .
what the fuck you talking about , 68 days !
that' s in jail , sucker .
you still don' t know where you' re at ?
yeah , where am i at , washington ?
with us , baby , you' re with us .
and you' re going to stay with us until we let you go .
do you want to say something to the group , mr. mcmurphy ?
i' d like to know why none of the guys never told me that you ... ... miss ratched ... ... and the doctors could keep me here till you' re good and ready to turn me loose .
that' s what i' d like to know .
fine , randall , that' s a good start .
would anyone care to answer mr. mcmurphy ?
answer what ?
you heard me , harding .
you let me go on hassling nurse ratched here ... ... knowing how much i had to lose and you never told me nothing !
now , mac , wait a minute .
wait a minute , i didn' t know anything about how much ...
shit !
wait a minute .
listen .
now , look ...
i' m voluntary here , see ?
i' m not committed .
i don' t have to stay here .
i mean , i can go home anytime i want .
you can go home anytime you want ?
that' s it .
you' re bullshitting me !
he' s bullshitting me , right ?
no , randall , he' s telling you the truth .
as a matter of fact , there are very few men here who are committed .
there' s mr. bromden .
mr. taber .
some of the chronics , and you .
cheswick ?
you' re voluntary ?
scanlon ?
billy , for christ' s sake , you must be committed , right ?
no , no , no .
you' re just a young kid !
what' re you doing here ?
you ought to be out in a convertible ... ... bird dogging chicks and banging beaver .
what are you doing here , for christ' s sake ?
what' s so funny about that ?
jesus , i mean , you guys do nothing but complain about how you can' t ... ... stand it in this place , and then you haven' t got the guts to walk out ?
what do you think you are , for christ' s sake ?
crazy or something ?
well , you' re not .
you' re not !
no crazier than the average asshole walking around on the streets .
and that' s it .
jesus christ , i can' t believe it !
those are very challenging observations you made , randall .
i' m sure some of the men would like to comment .
mr. scanlon ?
i want to know why the dorm is locked in the daytime and on weekends .
i would like to know about our cigarettes .
may i have my cigarettes , please , miss ratched ?
you sit down , mr. cheswick , and wait your turn .
go ahead , sit down !
to answer your question about the dorm , mr. scanlon .
you know very well ... ... that if we left the door open , you' d just go right back to bed after breakfast .
am i right ?
so what ?
may i have my cigarettes , please , miss ratched ?
forget the cigarettes , cheswick .
cigarettes are not important .
sit down , will you ?
for christ' s sake !
cigarettes !
remember , mr. scanlon , we' ve discussed many times ... ... that time spent in the company of others is very therapeutic .
while time spent brooding alone only increases a feeling of separation .
you remember that , don' t you ?
do you mean to say ... ... it' s sick to want to be off by yourself ?
miss ratched ?
mr. cheswick , you sit down !
i want to know about ...
sit down , mr. cheswick .
i want to ...
give him a cigarette , will you , harding ?
it' s my last one .
that' s a fucking lie .
why don' t you give him a cigarette ?
look , i' m not running a charity ward , see ?
come on !
look , i don' t want his cigarettes .
and i don' t want his , or his , or his ... ... or his , or his , or his ...
or even yours .
do you understand that ?
i want my cigarettes , miss ratched !
i want my cigarettes !
i want mine , miss ratched !
what gives you the damn right ... ... to keep our cigarettes piled up on your desk ... ... and to squeeze out a pack only when you feel like it , huh ?
miss ratched !
mr. harding !
oh , i' m sorry .
you surprise me .
i lost my head .
i' m sorry .
i' m sorry , i didn' t mean to ...
i' m really very sorry .
i just forgot .
i didn' t mean to .
i' m really very sorry .
i just forgot .
it' s all right .
miss ratched !
yes , mr. cheswick ?
i asked you a question !
i heard your question , mr. cheswick ... ... and i will answer your question as soon as you' ve calmed down .
are you calm , mr. cheswick ?
i' m calm .
good .
now , as you all know , mr. mcmurphy ... ... has been running a small gambling casino in our tub room .
now , most of you lost all your cigarettes to mr. mcmurphy ... ... not to mention a tidy sum of money to mr. mcmurphy .
and that' s why ... ... your tub room privileges have been suspended ... ... and your cigarettes have been rationed .
mr. martini ?
how are we going to win our money back ?
you' re not going to win your money back , mr. martini .
that' s all over .
if you had obeyed the rules in the first place ... ... you wouldn' t have lost your money .
sit down , gentlemen !
sit down , gentlemen !
sit down !
rules ?
piss on your fucking rules , miss ratched !
sit down .
will you ?
i want you to know something right here and now !

they were giving me 10, 000 watts a day , you know , and i' m ... ... hot to trot .
the next woman who takes me on will light up like a pinball machine ... ... and pay off in silver dollars !
