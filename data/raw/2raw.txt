we will still show our commitment to this country .
i appreciate that .
thank you , sir .
i wanna thank everybody .
this has been a difficult
time .
london , paris , athens , rome ,
belfast , beirut .
we' re not the first city to have to deal with terrorism .
and tel aviv ...
and tel aviv .
the day after they bombed the market in tel aviv , the market was open .
this is new york city .
we can take it .
god !
it' s the watley school .
not kids !
one of the moms was carrying a gun .
wounds the guy as he' s planting the device .
he kills her , then he locks them all in the room .
any kids get hurt ?
i don' t know .
i don' t know .
it' s over there on the table .
i don' t know if it' s a radio or a timer or what .
whoa , hold right there .
see if you can move in closer on the device .
right there .
focus that .
radio device .
he' s got a radio control .
what the fuck' s the media doing ?
they must be monitoring our frequency .
danny , your boys were supposed to call the faa to clear the airspace .
do it now !
this is nypd .
get those fuckin ' birds outta here !
hub !
everybody out .
need some help here .
it' s all right , come on .
hurry down the hall .
either we answer this threat quickly and convincingly , or next week there' il be a hundred more all over the world .
sounds great , general .
except why can' t we find out who' s behind it ?
it seems to me conventional law enforcement isn' t up to the task .
how about who' s behind who' s behind this ?
uh , libya , iran , iraq .
possibly syria .
ask a question , get an atlas .
all is i know is that we must respond .
excellent idea , senator .
how do we do that ?
find out who they are and bomb the shit out of ' em .
and if we can' t find out ?
look , i hate to be the voice of doom , but it keeps escalating .
a bus , then a theatre .
what' s next ?
how about sending in the national guard ?
the national guard is for riot control , not for counter terrorism .
the army then .
i' ve read the contingency plans .
it' s established legal doctrine that the army may not be turned against our own people .
even if that' s what our own people are asking for , three to one ?
if the president declares a state of ...
lincoln declared martial law in 1862 !
he suspended habeas corpus .
which was later found unconstitutional .
ex parte milligan .
i' ve got an election in november .
ex united states congressman .
let' s save the quips for the talk shows .
the president' s plane lands in two hours .
we owe it to him to have a consensus .
you don' t fight ajunkyard dog with aspca rules .
what you do is you take the leash off your own bigger , meaner dog .
general ?
the army' s a broadsword , not a scalpel .
trust me , senator , you do not want the army in an american city .
but how long would it take to deploy ?
we can' t go in until the president invokes the war powers act .
i understand that , general .
let' s assume the order has been given .
12 hours after the president gives the order , we can be on the ground .
one light infantry division of 10, 700 men .
elements of the rapid deployment force , special forces ,
delta , apcs , helicopters , tanks , and , of course , the ubiquitous m 16 a 1 assault rifle .
a humble enough weapon until you see it held by a man outside your local 7 eleven .
it will be noisy , it will be scary .
it will not be mistaken for a vfw parade .
i remind you , general devereaux does not speak for official army policy .
a police function has become accepted as our role in haiti and somalia .
make no mistake .
we will hunt down the enemy , we will find the enemy and we will kill the enemy .
and no card carrying member of the aclu is more dead set against it than i am .
which is why i urge you ,
i implore you , do not consider this as an option .
i know just what the president' s going to say .
that' s exactly why you' re the only man for the job .
i' d like to introduce anthony hubbard , my ascac on the ground in brooklyn .
his team was able to take out the first cell within 36 hours of the attack on the 87 bus .
he' s also the man who took out the terrorist in that schoolhouse .
hub ?
the job of the fbi is to ... to respond .
the job of the army is to defend .
with the presence of the army , our ability to investigate will be inhibited .
it will push these criminals further underground .
you can' t fight an enemy you can' t see .
i think if we exercise patience , restraint , allow our men and women up in new york to do theirjob ,
i think we' il be effective .
thank you .
l , too , think we should proceed with caution .
some of you may not know sharon bridger .
sharon was posted in iraq as part of our covert operations during the gulf war .
sharon ?
sir , if i may ?
thank you .
i' m sure everyone here knows the traditional model of the terrorist network .
one cell controls all others .
cut off the head , the body will wither .
unfortunately , the old wisdom no longer applies .
the new paradigm is each cell operates independent of the other .
cut off one head , another rises up in its place .
bus 87 was the work of the first cell , whose remaining elements , we believe , the fbi took down .
this then activated the work of cell two .
the theatre gala .
at most , we believe there are three , possibly four , cells .
then how much longer before we can take out the last cell ?
we don' t know .
this is a tragedy of staggering proportion .
one federal plaza was the headquarters of the fbi counter terrorism task force as well as other federal agencies .
authorities are withholding the names of those who died .
letters of condolence have been received from leaders around the world .
boris yeltsin forwarded a message condemning terrorism ...
body count' s a little over 200 so far .
what about our people ?
mike , tina , they were all in there working .
hub .
hub .
this is colonel hardwick , army intelligence .
colonel .
i' m here as an adviser only .
i intend to keep a low profile .
appreciate your concern .
i don' t mean to be insensitive , but what are your capabilities at this point ?
your infrastructure ?
you' re standing on our infrastructure .
excuse me .
hey , hub , they managed to get a partial vln number off the van .
dmv says it was stolen the day before near ...
brooklyn ?
you got it .
hub , the final body countjust came in .
600 dead .
very sorry about your friends .
frank , it' s uh ...
sharon .
i didn' t catch your last name .
bridger .
how you doin ' ?
been better .
well , the agency came up with another list of probables .
we should circulate them .
hey !
this stuff might be good .
why was there no warning from samir ?
he didn' t know anything .
says samir .
says me !
maybe i' il ask him .
yeah , over my dead body .
over 600 dead bodies .
he' s one of the good guys .
how can you be sure ?
because he was part of the operation to destabilise saddam hussein with me , ok ?
he' s a go between .
he risked his life for us .
go between who , sharon ?
i need names , ok ?
i need ... photographs or something .
i don' t need a history lesson .
i can' t give you pictures , i don' t know what they look like .
so you got nothing ?
i' ve got samir .
does samir have any contact with them ?
minimal .
so how does he do it ?
he can' t .
they initiate .
and otherwise ?
he' s waiting .
he' s waiting ? !
what the hell is he waiting for ?
more bodies , more buildings !
maybe he' s waiting to blow up a few more !
i know how you must feel .
you don' t know how i feel .
i lost friends of mine tonight .
they' il make contact soon .
when ? !
that' s what i wanna know .
when ?
why soon ?
why not now ?
what is the tradecraft ?
what are the visuals , the iron sites ?
you know , all that cla spy shit !
i tell you what i' m gonna do .
i' m gonna take your boy samir downtown , strap his ass to a polygraph machine , and i' m gonna ask him questions about you .
then i' m gonna take those transcripts to a friend of mine at the new york times , who writes about the link between the cla and political horror shows .
if you burn him , you lose your one chance !
so what ? !
it' s lose or lose , you said .
i' m not fucking with you !
how could you remember who you' re fucking ?
24 hours .
for what ?
24 hours for what , sharon ?
elise !
have anything for me ?
nothing new .
we' ve got three bombings in new york city , we' ve got 600 people dead .
uh , the nypd , the fbl , they don' t seem up to it .
do we need to bring the army in ?
absolutely .
how many have to die before we do bring the army in ?
troops are not trained to police their own population .
that' s why we have an fbi and a police force .
we don' t want an army in brooklyn .
you would have to speak to the army to verify those rumours .
and here we have the fbl , having failed to do their job ...
this is an attack , a time of war .
the fact it' s inside our borders means it' s a new kind of war .
this is what these towel heads do in their country .
now they' re bringing it here !
people must understand the word arab is not synonymous with the word terrorist .
islam is a religion of peace .
these people defile the koran when they use its words .
a merchant , abdul hassam , was beaten today ...
one of our greatest freedoms is the freedom from fear .
he pledged to protect that freedom .
the fbl' s received another fax .
ahmed bin talal .
apparently , they still believe that we have him .
do we ... " have him " ?
let me give you a little advice , steve .
do not come between me and the president .
i am speaking for the president .
as far as the president is concerned , no , we do not have him .
general , did you know that after yesterday' s attack , half the parents in this country kept their kids out of school .
they' re attacking our way of life .
it ends now !
are you saying the president is prepared to take the necessary steps ?
i am saying the president is prepared to be presidential .
hello ?
it' s me .
turn on the tv .
hang on .
the senate was in session late into the night , debating the president' s call for martial law .
we have a tradition of invoking martial law ...
i got it . only when the most dire of circumstances require it , but at what cost ?
all eyes now turn to new york city to see if martial law will bring the terror to an end .
move out !
good morning .
today with the invocation of the war powers act by the president , i am declaring a state of martial law in this city .
to the best of our knowledge , we are opposed by no more than 20 of the enemy .
he is hiding among a population of roughly two million .
intelligence tells us that he is most likely arab speaking , between 14 and 30 , narrowing the target to 15, 000 suspects .
we can further reduce that number down to those that have been here under six months .
now you have 20 hiding among 2, 000 .
if you are one of these 20 young men , you can hide among a population of similar ethnic background .
unfortunately , you can only hide there .
and that population , in the classic immigration pattern , is concentrated .
right here , in brooklyn .
we intend to seal off this borough .
then we will squeeze it .
this is the land of opportunity , gentlemen .
the opportunity to turn yourselves in .
after sundown tonight , any young man fitting the profile i described , who has not cooperated , will be arrested and detained .
there is nothing more corrosive to the morale of a population than policing its citizens , but the enemy would be mistaken if they were to doubt our resolve .
they are face to face with the most fearsome military machine , and i intend to use it and be back on base in time for the play offs .
thank you .
good to see you again .
can' t say the same about you .
not in that uniform .
i thought you were against it .
i am .
this was not my call .
so the president made you put tanks on the brooklyn bridge ?
you questioning my patriotism ?
i' m questioning yourjudgment .
i' m serving my president .
possibly not in the best interests of our nation , but my job does not let me make that distinction .
i won' t question your patriotism , but don' t ever question my command , understand ?
i' m not under your command .
you really believe that ?
take a look around .
tell me if you really think that' s true .
arrogant prick .
you ever met anybody so in love with the sound of his own voice ?
we' re putting samir in play .
now ?
he' il freak .
yeah , he' il freak .
i' m already freaked .
oh , fuck it !
one more lamb to the slaughter .
hey , hey , hey !
it' s fine .
he' s cool .
what he fucking doing here ? !
you know they' re killing arabs out there !
you can stop it , samir .
what do you mean ?
the army' s here .
they' re setting up interrogation centres and torturing people !
calm down , all right ?
i got to get out of here and you have to help me !
we' il help you !
i just need more money .
ok .
you got a student visa for ali waziri .
i told you .
i know nobody of that name .
liar !
tell him what he wants to know !
he knows !
this woman' s crazy !
i think you just don' t know who they are .
they' d never trust me !
look , i' ve got a picture of the two of us , samir .
remember it ?
i' m gonna post it in every shop in brooklyn and send copies to friends in the west bank .
your mother' s still there , isn' t she ?
fuckin ' let go of me !
get outta here !
get out !
i' m sorry .
hey , nobody' s gonna burn you .
ok , samir ?
nobody' s gonna call anybody .
who asked you to get the visa ?
oh , come on .
hey , hey , samir .
just calm down , ok ?
there' s nothing to be afraid of .
i' m afraid of going to hell .
me , too .
his name is tariq husseini .
he runs an auto shop on commerce street in red hook .
commerce street .
red hook .
anybody bothers you , anybody , you call me .
you' re good .
you' re not so bad yourself .
hey , floyd .
yeah .
hub .
listen , we gotta put something together in a hurry , all right ?
yeah , where' s frank ?
all right , well , give him a 911 .
ok , get a beat up car for me .
beat it up yourself if you have to .
896 commerce street .
it' s a garage in red hook .
yeah .
oh , shit !
they' re going house to house .
you know , tariq' il go underground .
we' re gonna hit him in less than an hour .
well , hit him hard .
where you going ?
i' m gonna go stash samir someplace safe .
right , i make out three inside .
the two guys by the trash barrel are ours .
they' il wait till we' re set , then come in after us .
ok .
all right , let' s roll .
yo , joaqun .

hey , tariq .

of course .

you' re joking !
i' m notjoking .
put the phone down , put your hands up .
hands in the air !
put ' em behind your head .
yeah , to you too .
everything' s gonna be all right .
tariq husseini , this is the us army .
you are surrounded .
you have 30 seconds to throw out any weapons and exit the premises with your hands on top of your head .
i repeat : this is the us army ...
freeze !
goddamn it !
goddamn it !
code red !
code red !
bravo one to alpha leader .
request permission to fire .
yes !

freeze !
put the gun down !

all right .
i' m f ...
i' m fbl !

ladies and gentlemen , there' il be a pool briefing for all accredited journalists ...

the perimeter ...
frankie !
frankie haddad !
frank haddad !

hub !
hub , they got frankie .

my kid' s in here someplace .
he' s only 13 !
all right , we' il get him out .
we' il find him .
frank haddad !
ow !
they came into my house !
my wife told them who i was !
frank !
how many times did i put it on the line ?
how many times ! ?
20 years we' re american citizens .
10 in the bureau !
all right .
they knocked her down , they took him out of my house !
frank haddad !
listen to me !
listen to me .
frank !
it' s wrong .
w we' il find him .
all right ?
we' il find him .
come on , come on .
no .
no !
i' il find him .
besides ... this is where i belong .
here .
tell them i' m not their sand nigger any more .
you say his name is haddad ?
no , had dad .
frank haddad .
h a d d a d. junior .
his father' s a shiite .
we' re checking him out .
his father is a federal agent my partner !
don' t get in my face .
i might decide you' re an ethiopian .
you' re stupid to think that' s an insult .
if there' s a mistake , we' il fix it .
there' s no mistake .
i' m vouching for the kid .
i want him out !
get your priorities straight .
we' il look into it .
yeah , you' il look into it , just like you been looking into me , right ?
you think i don' t know what' s goin ' on ?
i' m doin ' yourjob for you and i damn near get my head blown off !
now i want frank junior out and i wanna see my prisoner tariq husseini !
let' s go see your prisoner .
how long have you been at it ?
not long enough , apparently .
how much longer before he gives up the other cells ?
he can' t , if he doesn' t know where they are .
he knows .
he doesn' t .
you said it yourself , sharon , in the strategy meeting .
one cell doesn' t know where the other one is .
how long before he breaks , sharon ?
too long .
the theatre was hit nine hours after we took down the first cell .
so , what other models do we have ?
shaking ?
won' t work .
works for the israelis .
only in conjunction with sleep deprivation .
it takes 36 hours .
we don' t have 36 hours .
electric shock ?
the neurotransmitters just shut down .
water ?
palestinian authorities produce good intel with water .
there' s cutting .
it' s extremely messy .
are you people insane ?
what are you talking about ?
the time has come for one man to suffer to save hundreds of lives .
one man !
what about two or six ?
how about public executions ?
feel free to leave whenever you like .
come on , general .
you lost men , i lost men , but you , you , you can' t do this .
what if what they want ...
what if they don' t want the sheik ?
have you considered that ?
huh ?
what if what they want is for us to herd children into stadiums like we' re doing ?
and put soldiers on the street and have americans looking over their shoulders ?
bend the law , shred the constitution .
because if we torture him , general ...
we do that , and everything that we have bled and fought and died for is over .
and they' ve won .
they' ve already won !
escort him out .
he knew nothing .
call off the dogs .
we can' t call off the army
until the threat is gone .
the army is the threat .
devereaux' s killing innocent people .
you took the leash off him .
just put it back on .
you wearing a wire ?
are you ?
it was devereaux who took the sheik in the first place .
devereaux ?
so we do have him .
what d' you think , hub ?
our government operates as one coherent entity ?
everybody , you and me , we all wanted that sheik' s head .
devereaux didn' t start this agenda about hunting terrorists , he just pushed it a bit .
hang on a second .
so , now , what do we do ?
there is this feeling in certain circles that we should let the sheik go , set him free .
after all , we kidnapped him , kept him in isolation .
judge might let him walk .
you don' t free a murderer , any murderer .
any murderer !
sharon thinks we can get to the last cell , if they believe we' re gonna release the sheik .
why should they trust her ?
why should i trust her ?
ask her .
i ran the network in iraq for two years .
samir recruited them from among the sheik' s followers and i , uh , trained them in the north .
the sheik was gonna help us overthrow saddam .
i mean , he was our ally .
we were financing him .
then , uh ... then there was a policy shift .
it' s not like we sold them out exactly .
we just stopped helping them .
they were slaughtered .
so i , uh , quit the operation .
i took another assignment .
but you helped ' em first .
what d' you mean ?
you said they needed to get help .
they were on the terrorist watch list , so you got ' em visas , you and samir .
i promised them we would take care of them .
they were working for us .
doing what ... exactly ?
i told you !
no , you didn' t .
you told me that you trained them .
tradecraft , subversion .
that' s what you said , wasn' t it ?
you' re leaving something out , aren' t you , sharon ?
you taught them ... how to make bombs .
that' s why you were looking for the wiring signatures on that blue bus .
and now they' re here doing what you taught them how to do .
right ?
you' ve gotta let me make this right .
please ?
the president is in conference with the mayor , the governor and the attorney general of new york . ... putting them in a stadium , as we did with the japanese .
this is the time for all of us to proclaim our brotherhood with these people . ... the military to take back , in a peaceful fashion , our democracy from the people ...
the people of brooklyn will not be held hostage !
join community and religious leaders in a march to protest the mass ...
well , what if it was black people ?
huh ?
what if it was italians ?
american arabs are a vulnerable , visible population , and they have no power .
farouk ?
critics say this is racist and the government would not do this ...
samir has made contact , frank .
it' s the last cell .
he set up a meeting , but we gotta get the army off our tail .
i need your help , frank .
frank , it' s still our watch .
i don' t wanna see another dead body and i know you don' t .
and when this is over , i promise you we' il get your boy back .
march on city hall today .
no fear !
what time you got , frank ?
just 10 . 15 .
how' s he doing ?
tell me the message and i will pass it on .
i need to deliver it myself .
believe me , they' re gonna wanna hear what i have to say .
no fear !
tell ' em we' re not afraid !
sure he' il go through with this ?
well , if he doesn' t , he knows i' il give him to devereaux .
so ?
you know , this is the endgame , you understand ?
if this goes wrong ...
nothing' s gonna go wrong .
we' re the cla .
something always goes wrong !
well ...
if things get hairy , uh ... just remember the most committed wins .
let' s go .
the three of you really do make a lovely couple .
sharon , i beg you .
do not make me do this .
they ...
i mean , if they even dr ...
if they even dream we' ve been followed , they will kill us .
south on cadman plaza .
relax , all right ?
general , the feds are in motion .
do you copy ?
right , just stay with hubbard .
the man is not on our team .
roger that .
airborne , he' s all yours .
this is airborne .
we got him .
sound garden' s ready .
this is not the way to the bathhouse .
he said to get a key from my uncle .
stop whining , you' il feel the surveillance .
i had a bad feeling , you know ?
just relax .
keep your head down .
we ready ?
we' re all set .
we got to hurry , sharon .
we can' t be late .
here we go .
all units !
all units !
subject is on foot !
he' s running to front and pearl .
this is the us army .
stop , or we will open fire !
freeze !
we' re all clear .
right , let' s do it .
why we still here ?
we got to go .
calm down .
it' s gonna be fine .
look , we' il have to sit tight for three minutes .
can you just do that much for me ?
i can' t believe it .
look at this .
arab and jew , side by side .
black and white , christian and muslim .
what ?
it' s so tragic .
wh what' s tragic ?
what do you mean ?
are they gonna hit the march ?
can you imagine a better target ? ... because our government has no right to declare martial law !
no fear !
no fear !
no fear !
we got to hurry , sharon .
ok .
here , put this on .
shit , it' s 11 o' clock .
we gotta go .
they' re getting ready to move .
units 1 and 2 , on my signal .
units 3 and 4 , stand by .
units 5 and 6 ...
fbl !
oh ...
microwave !
this is an unlawful disturbance .
you must disperse .
i repeat , these soldiers carry live ammunition .
this is your final warning .
hub , we missed him .
the bathhouse .
so what' s going on ?
why aren' t they here ?
they' il be here .
don' t worry .
what are you doing ?
what message do you have for them ?
there' s no one else coming , is there ?
so , what message do you have for me , sharon ?
you' re the last cell .
there will never be a last cell !
it' s just the beginning .
no fear !
no fear !
how could i have missed the play ?
it' s because of the money .
you believe money is power .
belief is power .
just don' t tell me we financed your operation .
the world is a wheel , sharon .
samir , the koran preaches ...
do not speak to me of the koran , woman !
first , you left me there in iraq like a piece of shit !
and then you take our leader , a holy man .
you put him in prison for preaching the word of god .
so now you have to learn the consequences of trying to tell the world how to live .
it' s over .
your point' s been made .
why shed more blood ?
those poor people out there ...
they' re fucking marching for your cause .
yeah .
and they , too , will become its martyrs .
samir !
let her go .
away from the door !
he' s got a bomb !
get up .
get up .
get up !
no !
samir , let her go and you' il live .
move away from this fuckin ' door !
don' t !
samir ...
hub , i' m here .
no shots , frank .
samir .
do you wanna die ?
do you ?
look , i blow it !
then we all die .
nobody' s leaving here .
move away from this door !
shoot .
shut up .
shoot !
shut up !
shoot me !
i' m coming !
shut up !
shoot !!
i' m coming !
do it !
shoot !
shoot !
one of ours down .
stomach wound .
get here now .

hub ...
sh !
i' m right here .
i' m right here .
hub ?
uh ...
i' m right here .
sh sh sh .
i' m sorry .
it' s ok .
are you ok ?
i' m cold .
ok .
forgive us our trespasses , as we forgive those who trespass against us .
and lead us ...
and lead us not into temptation , but deliver us from evil .
for thine is the kingdom ...
inshallah .
no fear !
no fear !
agent hubbard , would you explain to me why you detained colonel hardwick and six of my staff ?
the last cell was taken down .
it was samir .
we took him out .
how can you be sure it' s the last cell ?
sharon .
sharon' s been compromised .
sharon is dead .
she gave her life .
sorry , hub .
it' s all over with , general .
what is ?
the sheik .
is that so ?
clear violation of international law .
