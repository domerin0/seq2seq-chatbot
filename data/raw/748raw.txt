# i need a ken doll pilot with a sexy smile and a flying limousine
# to pick me up , go the extra mile and deliver me to the scene
# i need five more hours in the average day
# one to get the work done , four to play
# be a devil and angel you know what i mean ?
# stand back
# out of my way
# stand back
# you' re crowding my day
# no time for good manners , do what i say
# if you' re not here to help then you' re just in the way
# the road is littered with the faint of heart , the fools who fell from stress
# it' s a fact of life that you can' t catch up , better learn how to love the mess
# so i' il just kick back , ignore the noise , have my way with the pretty boys ,
# what i dream at night don' t even try to guess
# stand back # stand back
# out of my way
# stand back # stand back
# you' re crowding my day
# now this is my time to step up to the mike
# like rock' n' roll lightning i' m ready to strike
# stand back # stand back

i' ve made the food and taken responsibility for three very scared children .

" section 5 .
custody and care of the davis children .
an account and trust has been set up at maplewood savings bank , in the names of audrey , henry and sarah davis .
this bank also holds the mortgage on the davis property at 207 , oak street .
yes , larry , and that mortgage is quite large .
we do need to talk about that , also .
we will .
with regard to custody of audrey , henry and sarah , we hereby appoint sole guardianship of all three children , imbuing her with all legal rights and responsibilities that guardianship entails , to helen harris .
what ?
what ?
it' s not a mistake .
i prepared this for them myself .
they were very clear .
helen harris .
jenny should have them .
i ...
she' s got kids .
i ...
she' s got the mom haircut .
she' s supermom .
she left a letter for each of you explaining her decision .
you know i handled your mother' s will .
lindsay and paul' s was equally specific .
good lord , lindsay .
can i read yours ?
helen .
are there any contingencies ?
yes .
if helen is either unable or unwilling to care for the children ,
then you , jenny , are thusly appointed .
ok , finally , some reason .
thank you .
god , why didn' t you start with that ?
can you imagine helen raising three kids ?
when should i tell them ?
as soon as possible .
are you sure ?
yep .
but we all thought ...
nope .
it' s gonna be hard to take care of us if you' re dead too .
this ?
won' t kill me for years .
who' s gonna take me to school ?
i guess i am .
and make me chicken fingers ?
me .
and give me a bath ?
me .
and check my nose boogies for infections ?
we' il find someone else to do that last thing .
come here .
all we gotta do is stick together .
everything' s gonna be ok .
thanks for trying , aunt helen , but it' s not gonna be ok .
come on , sarah .
it' s time for your bath .
come on , henry .
good idea .
great .
uh ...
you guys do that , while aunt helen is gonna go out and check the lawn .
is aunt helen older than you , audrey ?
get farther down .
is she playing hide and go seek ?
i don' t think so .
we are in deep shit .
i love new york pizza .
aunt helen , can we go to the statue of liberty tomorrow ?
no , because we won' t be here ...
where' s henry ?
he said he' d be right back .
i go to the bathroom for five seconds , and he' s gone ?
with mustard .
here it is .
i didn' t want mustard .
you don' t want mustard ?
no .
all right .
no mustard .
there he is .
henry !
ok ?
who' s gonna pay for this ?
aunt helen .
you can' t do that .
you can' t just leave .
i hate pizza .
i wanted a hot dog .
can you pay aaron , please ?
i' m aaron .
hi , aaron .
i like that he' s making new friends .
it' s lovely .
talk me up !
the next time you want something like a hot dog , you tell me , ok ?
and we' il all go together .
ok .
where are we going to dinner ?
this is dinner .
gee , mommy never let pizza be our whole dinner .
and dad always said not to eat and walk at the same time .
well , they' re not here to yell at us , so it doesn' t matter .
how many beds do you have in your apartment , aunt helen ?
aunt helen !
audrey , your knee .
stop !
hey , guys .
shh !
i' m telling you , if we don' t go to sleep right now ,
sleepless sally gets really upset when the kids aren' t going to sleep .
where' s sarah ?
sarah ?
i' m right down here .
henry' s feet stink .
phew !
but i' m a man .
give aunt helen a whiff .
i don' t want to smell your feet .
ew !
i can smell them from here .
ew !
ew !
henry !
you need to wash your feet not once a week .
good night , all .
audrey , get out of the bathroom .
fire !
fire !
aunt helen ?
hm ?
why are we going back ?
this was great .
we should spend more time here .
more time ?
yeah .
we can move here .
we can' t sleep every night in a stinky feet bed .
we' il move to another apartment .
it' s a huge city .
you' il be closer to your job and everything .
you love your job .
what about henry and sarah ?
what about them ?
they' ve got school .
they have friends .
you guys grew up in that neighborhood .
that' s why .
it' s a sad neighborhood now .
everywhere we go there , we think of mom and dad .
the kids treat me differently .
we will discuss this later .
please think about it , aunt helen .
ok , we got a train to catch .
let' s go .
henry , stop brushing your teeth .
they' re gonna fall out .
i can' t get hippo in the bag .
oh , give it to me .
ok .
there .
he' s in the bag .
are you happy now ?
henry !
now , the only thing to do would be to tell aunt jenny .
thinking about it , audrey .
i will think about it .
tell her we voted .
i' il think about it , audrey .
i understand the children' s feelings ,
but that' s not part of the plan .
that' s your plan , jenny .
all right , well , what about the idea of not selling lindsay' s house ?
i know you guys offered to pay the mortgage , but it' s enormous .
i spoke to the bank , and the mortgage is too much for us .
all right .
besides being my idea , what' s wrong with moving down the block ?
i mean , i think the calm of the familiar is better than the overwhelming hustle bustle of the city .
guys , can you please keep the coloring on the eggs and not each other ?
oh , no , no , no .
no .
jenny , sarah thinks that hippo' s parents are on vacation .
that they' re coming back .
henry walks around like a zombie and draws skeletons .
audrey is my only ally .
you really have to watch her .
look , they' re not happy .
and they' ve told me themselves .
they' re not gonna be happy anywhere right now .
ok , ok .
wait .
wait .
let us talk for a minute .
wait till you see what the easter bunny brings .
he' s gonna bring lots more eggs .
the easter bunny' s not coming .
the easter bunny joined 50 cent .
why are you being a brat ?
you' re a brat .
helen is right .
a change might do them some good .
and if it doesn' t work out , they can always move back here to jersey .
ew , you got some in my hair .
you know what ?
you know what ?
oh !
oh , no .
you' re not very good at this , aunt helen .
stop it !
irwin' s after ya !
turtles carry ... carry diseases .
stop it .
sarah , please .
we have to find an apartment .
we need to help aunt helen .
ok ?
by being quiet .
stop it .
stop .
no .
chelsea .
no .
you know , i hear there' s some pretty decent stuff in queens .
no .
we are not bridge and tunnel people .
we are manhattan people .
oh , wow .
four bedrooms .
close to central park .
the owner wants it rented quickly , so he' s asking what is very reasonable for a new york apartment .
only nine thousand a month .
# i feel like an android living in a polaroid
# just another reject , it gets a little seasick
# whose life am i in ?
# feels like dj vu , don' t know what to do
# point my finger to the sky and finally ask the question why
# whose life am i in ?
# whose life am i in ?
# whose life am i in ?
that' s the girl looking at 4b .
one bathroom .
that' s it ?
yeah , well ,
i' il put you on a waiting list if a two opens up .
and look at this flower power , huh ?
so i guess audrey can have the back room and henry and sarah can share the middle one and i' il just sleep on a pull out couch .
wow , graffiti .
sure , there' s plenty of room for a pull out couch here .
look , you got a nice view .
so , the ad said something about a visual security system .
how does that work ?
when somebody buzzes , you stick your head out the window and you look down .
that' s the visual part .
then you yell for them to come up or not .
that' s the security part .
here' s your keys .
welcome to the astoria arms .
i am only available between 8 : 30 and nine in the morning because i have a life .
so ... home !
yeah !
i ordered the pizza .
it should be here in 30 minutes .
yay !
um ...
know what , i bet this is lead paint .
guys .
guys , guys .
don' t chew on the windowsills , all right ?
yeah .
stick to the table legs , like i taught you .
ok , come on , guys .
let' s go , let' s go .
sometime today .
into the bedroom .
this window is also painted shut .
you know , i mean , for 1200 a month , you' d think you' d have windows that open .
i want this bed .
look , for the tenth time , in the old house i had this bed and you had that bed .
but i want this bed .
that' s it !
hippo goes out the window .
followed by irwin .
guys !
stop fighting .
he pinches her all the time , and hard .
it' s hard .
thank you .
so , it' s not that bad , right , jen ?
no .
hi .
i' m nilma prasad .

yes .
helen is new at being a mom .

oh , i' m so sorry .
bless her .
so , nilma , if you could from time to time ...
oh , absolutely .
and if they ...

you could ...
no problem .
that' s all i' m asking .
ok , say no more , please .
thank you so much .
ok , no problem .
just mommy talk .
oh , right .
so , helen , where have you decided to send the kids to school ?
got it covered .
it' s just middle school and you' il both have to be separated ,
all three of you .
no .
i vote against separation .
you know , maybe we should find a school with less policemen everywhere .
audrey .
hi .
let' s go .
come on , guys .
this cab' s gonna be about $100 .
that girl is fine .
hi .
yeah , she' s pretty .

lutheran people have been around .
being a lutheran is the greatest .
i mean , right , kids ?
hippo wants to be a lutheran , too .
hippo is a lutheran .

cable guy .

would you like to come in ?
pastor dan .
hey , kids .
how did he get past the visual security system ?
who cares ?
now we can watch mtv .
yeah .
it' s funny how one moment i' m living my life not really in touch with the fact that i' m sharing this planet with permanent pens , and the next moment one such pen has made , shall we say , an indelible impact on my career .
hey , helen .
a black mark on my record ,
x ed out my future ...
helen . ... and , in short , my career is dead .
like your turtle .
what ?
turtle' s dead .
oh , no .
oh , irwin , no .
may he rest in peace ...
shut up .
you don' t understand .
this is henry' s turtle .
it' s his friend .
he' s ...
he can' t be dead .
oh , he' s dead .
we need to find a body double now .
here .
what about the empty bowl ?
i' il hide it .
ki ...
kids !
we' re gonna go get butterscotch and chocolate syrup for the ice cream .
you stay put and watch television .
and don' t come in the kitchen , i just waxed the floors .
irwin' s long lost brother .
yeah .
thanks for doing this .
you' re my savior .
i mean ...
i know what you mean .
so , how are things going ?
fine .
hm ?
fine .
just fine ?
yeah .
what do you mean ?
well , it' s just that
i' ve noticed audrey spending too much time with the boys .
you know , that' s normal for what she' s going through , to look for that attention , but some of these kids are not exactly angels , you know what i mean ?
they' re 15 .
it' s teenage stuff .
it' s harmless .
no , it' s not really harmless , cos one of these punks his name' s bz
i' m about to kick his butt outta school .
let' s just get upstairs before henry finds the bowl .
yeah , henry .
you said the kid likes basketball .
he never ever picks up a ball .
i know .
i' ve noticed that .
the thing with sarah and the shoes the other day , that' s not the first time ...
hey , what do you expect , dan ?
they' ve lost their parents , moved to a new city , changed schools , changed religions .
well , let' s talk about some things you could do at home .
you wanna know what i' ve been doing at home ?
i' ve been doing the best i can .
do you have any idea what this has done to my life ?
hey , helen , do you have any idea what it' s done to theirs ?
hey , pastor dan , mr self righteous , i' m hanging on by a thread here .
i lost my sister , my social life , my disposable income , my ability to fit into a size two and this just in my job .
pretty much the only two things that haven' t disappeared are my nicotine fits and the few pounds that have recently taken up residence on my ass .
so forgive me if i' m not too thrilled about being lectured , in queens , about being a lousy legal guardian to three kids who maybe shouldn' t have been given to me in the first place .
they weren' t given to you , they were entrusted to you by their mother , who ...
don' t you talk about lindsay .
don' t you dare talk about lindsay .
you didn' t know her .
gimme the turtle .
that was outta line .
i' m sorry .
dan , give me the damn turtle .
helen ...
helen .
hey , helen .
dominique' s is quite an impressive background .
but three children ?
they' re great kids .
they pretty much take care of themselves .
we love children .
we' re thinking about adopting .
but there' d be a lot of traveling involved and very little notice .
i love traveling .
but would they be long trips ?
but i' m not on the mommy track .
we' il be in touch .
irwin , you' re not looking yourself .
ok , sarah' s asleep .
go to bed now and make sure if she needs anything , you can get it for her .

who' s that ?
he writes poems .
on the side of our building .
with spray paint at four in the morning .
sometimes i help when i can' t sleep because aunt helen' s on a date or audrey' s on the internet talking dirty or sarah' s crying because we forgot to feed her again .
henry .
what ?
jenny , no .
henry , what are you talking about ?
is this some kind of joke ?
i don' t know why you keep saying things like this .
it' s not funny .
i thought it was funny .
thank you .
henry was making all of that up , jenny .
jenny , what are you doing ?
when a problem comes along you must whip it .
before the cream ...
jenny , give me my letter .
that' s it ?
that' s all she left behind to explain why she chose you ?
the lyrics to " whip lt " ?
it makes sense to me .
what is it with you two and that song ?
it' s ridiculous .
i don' t get it .
exactly !
what are you saying ?
that that' s the point ?
i' m no fun ?
that i don' t get things ?
that i never make jokes ?
show me your letter .
no .
no ?
no ?
what do you mean " no " ?
we said you would read my letter and i would read yours .
this is not a letter .
these are lyrics .
nonsensical lyrics .
this is not a letter .
if this was a letter , you could read my letter , but this is not a letter .
not a letter ?

you are a smug , bitter , colossal bitch .
ok .
guys .
i think this is a good time to take origami for a walk .
no , we' il miss the fight .
if you' re finished , i think i' d like to serve dessert .
you don' t wanna help me , you just wanna judge me .
let' s all go into the living room and listen to jasmine play the piano with one arm .
you just wanna prove that you' re a better mother than me , that lindsay was wrong .
why would i need to prove that ?
of course i' m a better mother than you .
i' ve been doing it forever .
but does that matter ?
no .
she still chose you over me .
exactly .
she chose , jenny .
not me .
i had no control over it .
you' re angry with me because of a decision that she made for me .
# merrily , merrily , merrily , merrily life is ...
i am giving up everything for these kids , and you have no idea what that' s like .
i don' t know what it' s like ?
how do you think i got this way ?
whatever this way is that' s so particularly unfun and funny .
who changed your diapers ?
don' t start with that .
mom died when i was seven .
who fed you ?
who baby sat you ?
lindsay was there , too .
lindsay was in new york trying to be a dancer and i was at home not having a normal childhood cos i was too busy being your mommy .
and you' re tra la la helen .

i' m gonna go change .
i' m sorry that i yelled at you , dan , but i' ve been battling with the kids ,
i' m fighting with my sister and we' re too stubborn to talk to each other .
i guess i' m just edgy .
hey , nobody ever said it was gonna be easy .
right ?
yeah , try doing it on your own .
we got a lot of people around here who do .
matt higgins ' mom , she took a pay cut , she works out of her house .
and tommy meyers ' dad is with the kids all day long , then he works at night .
i mean , it' s tough , but it can be done .
hey , you know what you need ?
a nanny .
but i can' t afford one .
you need some fun .
i' m just the man to provide it .
what are you doing on sunday ?
going to church , of course .
yeah , right .
nice try .
you and the kids .
sunday afternoon .
what do you have in mind ?
today we' re at the central park zoo , where every spring a prayer is said , blessing the animals and the newborn babies .
pastor .
dear lord , we humbly ask that you bless these animals and all your creatures throughout the world .
blessed are you , lord .
amen .
ok , who wants a private tour of the zoo , huh ?
yeah !
yeah !
all right , pastor dan .
# i do believe it
# i do believe it' s true
# mm hm hm
# mm hm hm
# whoa oh
# mm hm hm
# it' s a light and tumble journey
# from the east side to the park
# just a fine and fancy ramble to the zoo
# but you can take a crosstown bus if it' s raining or it' s cold
# and the animals will love it if you do
# if you do
# something tells me it' s all happening at the zoo .
we had a really great time .
i did too .
i' m glad you guys came .
thanks again , pastor dan .

you wanna go out with me sometime ?
what ?
you and me , on a date .
oh , no .
i made you abandon your vows ?
i know you think that i' m probably worth it , and i' m not .

# i' m just a fool for you , baby
# and nothing' s gonna change
# and maybe it' s my sweetest pain
# my sweetest pain
# fool for you , baby it' s driving me nuts
# uh uh uh uh
# uh uh uh uh uh
it' s really not that big of a deal , dan .
hey , she was caught making out with bz .
ok , not so good .
while cutting class .
also not so good .
in a balcony in my church .
how can i come down on her for something we were caught doing a few days ago ?
because you' re the adult and she' s the child .
she' s gotta know you' re serious .
kids need boundaries .
you know that .
but , aunt helen , it' s a big deal that a senior asked me to the prom .
i mean , what do you want me to do ?
find another senior ?
yes .
audrey , i wanna treat you like an adult , but i do not want you to go to the prom with bz .
if you go with him , i' il be very disappointed .
ok .
ok .
so , will you help me find a dress ?
yes , i' il find you a dress .
ok .
in the balcony of the church ?
seemed like a good idea at the time .
you are so going to hell .
hey .
spider .
ok .
cradle .
all right , guys .
shoot .
whoo !
ok .
hit the showers .
henry , pick up the balls .
hey .
gimme one of those .
come on .
let' s go .
take a shot .
come on .
you gotta get fired up for your game .
i am .
can' t you tell ?
yahoo .
oh , henry .
ok .
henry ?
let' s talk .
you used to love to play sports .
sit down .
you and your dad used to play basketball till it was too dark to even see the hoop .
even when i missed , he' d always count it .
he called it " giving me the benefit of the dark .
it' s ok to smile about it .
no , it' s not .
and it' s ok to play sports .
no .
why ?
because he can' t play any more .
because everyone kept saying mom and dad are up in heaven and they' re looking down on us always .
well , if he is , i' m not gonna make him feel bad about not playing .
like if you' re having a good time without him , you' re rubbing it in ?
yeah .
henry .
the only thing sadder than them not being here is knowing that by not being here , you' re not doing what you love .
they want you to be happy .
but then it' s like i' m just forgetting them .
no , it' s not .
no .
cos every time you smile , or laugh , or enjoy your life , it makes their dreams come true .
besides , if they are looking down , you really want them to be stuck watching a lousy game ?
no .
my dad hates a lousy game .
come on .
yeah !
yes .
i am the senior class treasurer .
and i just ...
i want to say that i' m very honored to be taking audrey to my prom tonight .
i want you to know that .
thank you .

hey .

hi , i' m mickey massey .
um ...
i' ve been married for a long time now , but my wife and i don' t have any children , so my cars became my babies .
i know .
that sounds obsessive .
but you don' t know the joy i feel when i find them a good home .
i mean , look at these beauties .
what' s not to love ?
massey motors .
come visit us .
i love my cars .
and you will , too .
massey motors .
in queens .
now back to the saturday six o' clock movie .
phone call , mr massey .
it' s your wife .
thank you .
thank you , sharon .
hello , diane .
oh , please .
i look like i always do .
good night , tim .
thank you very much .
sure i will ...
hold on a minute .
hi .
helen , you' ve come back to work .
oh , no .
no .
mickey , i need to borrow a car desperately .
it' s an emergency .
sure .
use one of the test drives .
ok .
hey , you were great on tv .
sure , i looked great , but did i sell any cars ?
i' m sorry .
eddie , i need this car .
you can' t take this car .
it' s mr massey' s ...
i know , but it' s the only one with a full tank of gas .
i have to go .
what movie star did i look like ?
well ...
helen , i think you misunderstood .
ed .
ed , who do we know with a jaguar ?
could be a celebrity coming to knit with you .
origami , origami .
shh .
origami .
helen .
i' m here for my kids .
ok .
i' m listening .
i don' t know who i am any more without them .
i need them and i want them back .
ok , let me see if i' ve got that .
you need them because you want them , because you don' t know who you are without them .
see , all i' m hearing is " you , you , you .
but this can' t be about you .
it has to be about them .
what don' t you understand ?
i love those kids .
whether or not you love them was never the question .
it was whether or not you could raise them .
the power to take the kids back is yours .
this is not a power struggle between you and me .
this is me asking you to do the right thing for everyone .
the kids aren' t packed .
it' s too late for them to go anywhere tonight , anyway .
ed , can you let origami out ?
come on .
the bases are loaded .
jeter' s up .
i' il be right back .
ed .
i mean , don' t you hear him ?
hi .
hey , henry , audrey .
i miss you guys .
you guys heard all that ?
yeah , we did .
hey , you left irwin back at our place .
why ?
it' s not really irwin .
my irwin had a skull and crossbones that i drew on his stomach .
why didn' t you say something ?
seemed you didn' t want me to know .
sarah , honey , why don' t you go play with turtle and figure out a name for him ?
i just couldn' t stand the idea of you losing something else you cared so much about .
can i put him in a bowl ?
yeah .
sarah , you wanna help henry with the turtle ?
can i name him hippo ?
why do you want to name everything hippo ?
because i can spell it .
audrey , sweetie , can you do me a favor and get me your wallet ?
why ?
could you just do it , please ?
open it up and give me your fake id .
why ?
because i said so , that' s why .
i' m not gonna give it to you .
i' m not a child .
yes , you are .
you are a child , audrey , and you have a right to a childhood and you should fight for it .
but if you won' t , then i will .
now , give me your id .
that was very adult of you .
you tricked me .
i thought you were on my side , but you' re just like her .
i hate you .
do you hear me ?
i hate you .
well ,
i' m just gonna have to live with that .
well , we don' t have to decide this tonight .
jenny .
what are you doing ?
at first , i didn' t agree with this letter , but ...
sit down .
no , i think i' il swing .
in fact , you know what they say ?
what ?
it' s not over till the fat lady swings .
see ?
i can make a joke .
dear jenny , if you' re reading this , you know that i am gone , and i asked helen to be the guardian for the kids .
and you' re probably freaked about it .
yes , it' s a surprising choice , considering that you are the most incredible mother i' ve ever known .
if you find this letter odd , understand that my always be prepared paul convinced me to write it now , while our children are young .
you must know from experience that when it comes to picking somebody else to raise your kids , no one seems right .
no one is you .
and so you choose someone who is most like you .
someone that will give the kids a taste of their real mom .
the mom they lost and never really got to know .
in so many ways , we are so much alike .
that' s why i chose helen .
they' re all yours .
of course , she' il have lots of fights with the kids , yet she' il find a way to make up .
welcome to the mamahood .
i know sometimes she messes things up and makes big mistakes .
on the other hand , she also makes big comebacks .
respect her , jenny .
give her a shot .
we' re family , and i' m counting on you to keep everyone together .
i know helen will certainly need some help
learning how to be a mother to my kids , but i' ve got you for that , and who could be better ?
ok .
after all , you raised helen .
you' il teach her how to be a mom .
just like you taught her how to tie her shoes .
the bunny goes around the tree and into the burrow .
pull tight .
yes !
it' s about time , sarah .
