at the end of the world war tomainia weakened ,
revolution had broken out , her diplomats sued for peace while tomainia' s army fought on , confident its war machine would smash the enemy' s lines ,
big bertha , able to fire 100 miles , was to make its appearance on the western front , and strike terror into the enemy , 75 miles away was her target : the cathedral of notre dame ,
95, 452 .
stand clear !
fire !
stand by your trigger !
95, 455 .
breach secured .
stand clear .
ready ...
fire !
defective shell .
we' il examine it .
check the fuse .
yes , the fuse .

air raid .
after big bertha .

this is no time to scratch .
pull yourself together .
take this .

fall in !
hey you , come on !
order arms !
prepare to attack .

only too willing to oblige , sir .
you saved my life .
thank you .
i' il strap you in .
i can' t make it alone .
you' il have to stay with me .
can you fly ?
i can try .
lift my hand to the stick .
i haven' t the strength .
take charge of that gun !
the enemy !
quick , lift my hand to the throttle .
we' il fool ' em !
hold on to these dispatches .
if we get them to general schmelloffel ,
tomainia may yet win .
i' m going to faint .
don' t say that .
sorry .
where am i ?
don' t you know me ?
yes , i feel better now .
the blood' s returning to my head .
what' s below ?
the sun ?
shining upwards .
strange .
how' s the gas ?
kept me awake all night .
no , the gasoline in the tank !
almost empty .
we must be nearly there .
what time is it ?
approximately one minute to twelve .
strange .
we seem to be defying the laws of gravity .
water .
quick , i' m going to faint .
wait a while .
we' il get into trouble if you faint any more .
just hold it .
i think i ...
now ...
take it !
something' s wrong .
i can' t reach it .
it' s all gone .
what' s the matter ?
belt too tight .
loosen it .
i' m trying to !
we' re upside down .
i know it !
the stick !
impossible .
there it goes .
we' re out of gas .
well , i suppose this is the end .
cigarette ?
not now !
i shan' t need this any more .
what month is it ?
april .
spring in tomainia .
hilda will be in the garden , tending the daffodils .
how she loves daffodils !
she' d never cut them for fear of hurting them .
it was like taking a life to cut a daffodil .
sweet , gentle hilda .
a beautiful soul .
she loved animals , and little children , too .
we' ve landed !
dispatches !
comrade , where are you ?
the dispatches ...
where are they ?
are you hurt ?
take me to general schmelloffel .
if we don' t deliver these , we' re defeated .
the war' s over .
what ?
we lost .
hynkel takes power , the jewish soldier suffered a loss of memory and remained in hospital for years , ignorant of the change in tomainia ,
hynkel ruled the nation with an iron fist ,
under the double cross emblem liberty was banished ,
only the voice of hynkel was heard ,
adenoid hynkel said ,
tomainia was down but today has risen ,
democracy is fragrant ,
liberty is odious ,
freedom of speech is objectionable ,
tomainia has the greatest army ,
the greatest navy ,
but to remain great we must sacrifice ,
we must tighten our belts ,
he now speaks to field marshal herring , minister of war ,
now herr garbitsch , minister of the interior ,
he remembers his early struggles , shared by his two loyal comrades ,
a reference to the jewish people ,
the phooey remarks that for the world he has peace in his heart
we now pause for station identification ,
this is the pari mutual network , bringing you
hynkel' s address to the children of the double cross ,
the interpreter is hynkel' s personal translator , reading from a prepared manuscript ,
stand by for further commentary , go ahead , tomainia ,
his excellency is about to descend the stairs ,
your excellency , are you hurt ?
ride in the other car .
his excellency seems pleased as he is greeted by tomainian children ,
he pauses before a woman with a child ,
camera !
even the baby is thrilled and seems all smiles at the attention ,
his excellency leaves the scene and will return along hynkelstrasse , where he' il pass tomainia' s modern masterpieces : the venus of today and the thinker of tomorrow ,
how was it ?
the speech ?
very good .
your reference to the jews might have been more violent .
what ?
to arouse the people' s anger .
violence against the jews might make the people forget their stomach .
you' re right .
things have been quiet in the ghetto lately .
good morning , mr jaeckel .
what' s good about it ?
conditions could be worse .
if you think so , you have a great imagination .
you heard hynkel' s speech .
i heard nothing .
i' ve got my own troubles .
you' re better off than a lot of people .
what about the barber ?
still in hospital .
he' s been there since the war .
why not rent his barbershop for him ?
he won' t let me .
every few weeks he writes to say he' s coming back .
a pity it should be idle all these years .
why worry ?
the government will soon take it from him .
perhaps you' re right .
not such a good morning after all .
now you said it .
hannah .
on the mantelpiece is my tobacco pouch .
will you get it ?
everyone is full of troubles .
yeah , everyone .
look at hannah , poor girl .
a hard worker , can' t get a job .
father was killed in the war , mother died last year .
can' t earn enough to pay her rent .
what can i do ?
i can' t throw her out .
you need some more .
where are you going ?
mrs shoemaker' s laundry .
you' d better take the key .
mrs jaeckel and i are going out .
i' m locking up in case the storm troopers start their monkey business again .
aryan !
we' re aryans !
and we go marching by !
look , fellows !
tomatoes and potatoes .
i' il take a box home .
hey , the lorry .
hold it there , will you ?
you have no right !
just charge it to my account !
nice ripe tomatoes .
why don' t some of you do something ?
if i were a man i' d show you .
what would you do , pretty ?
not one of you has the guts to stand up alone and fight !
is the lorry in case someone hits back ?
shut up !
come and take me .
you' il get medals for it .
you pick on women and rob defenceless people .
don' t rob the poor girl , boys .
give her back her tomatoes .
i' il have to do it again .
pigs !
patient 33 !
yes , sir ,
an interesting case : amnesia .
jewish soldier .
been here since the war .
he thinks it' s only been weeks .
does he knows what' s happened ?
no .
his one interest seems to be in his barbershop , which he believes he left a few weeks ago .
he' il have many surprises .
i' m afraid so .
yes ?
number 33 is gone ,
he was to be examined .
but he' s disappeared ,
disappeared ?
let him go .
it isn' t a serious case .
there' s little we can do for him .
come on , get out of here !
what are you doing ?
i don' t know .
leave that alone .
don' t be silly .
i' m not silly !
i appreciate that .
when you talk to me , " hail hynkel " !
who are you ?
i' il show you who i am !
come down to headquarters !
that' s my shop .
i don' t care if it is or not .
going to put up a fight , are you ?
come to headquarters .
let me tell you something .
policeman ?
arrest that man for assault .
come here , you !
leave me alone .
attacking a storm trooper !
you' il hear from my lawyer .
he bit my finger !
sorry , i didn' t mean to hit you .
i enjoyed that .
but you' d better beat it .
i' il call a policeman .
no !
why not ?
are you crazy ?
more are coming !
more what ?
wait !
come in here .
what' s wrong with you ?
don' t be foolhardy .
what' s this ?
who hit you ?
i think it was a gang .
you' d better get fixed up .
we' il investigate later .
what time is it ?
all right , they' ve gone .
thanks , mister .
that did me a lot of good .
you' ve sure got some nerve .
we should all fight back .
we can' t fight alone , but we can lick ' em together .
we didn' t do so bad .
you' re the barber , who was in hospital !
mr jaeckel has talked about you .
we didn' t think you' d come back .
the storm troopers will be after you .
you' d better hide .
i' il get the key to the cellar .
is this the man ?
that' s him .
hail hynkel !
who' s he ?
don' t fool with me .
hail hynkel !
your hands .
just a moment .
not here .
bring him outside .
first you' il finish this .
here .
go on , paint that !
wait a minute , boys .
i' ve got a bright idea .
commander schultz !
first in command .
second in command .
oh , never mind .
you !
who told you to hang people from lampposts ?
what was the trouble ?
a jew attacking storm troopers .
where is he ?
there .
break ranks .
so there you are .
stand him up .
get up .
you ?
don' t you remember me ?
you saved my life .
me ?
strange .
and i always thought of you as an aryan .
i' m a vegetarian .
don' t you remember ?
we got away in my plane .
plane ?
then we crashed .
now i remember .
well , how are you ?
what' s my friend done ?
he resisted my men painting his windows .
any brave man would resist .
i' m sorry for this .
no harm .
in future you will not be molested again .
if you or your friends ever need help ...
who did that ?
one of my friends .
hynkel' s palace was the centre of the world' s greatest war machine ,
behind it was the dynamic adenoid hynkel , whose genius ran the nation , whose ceaseless activity kept him occupied every moment of the day ,
marshal herring is waiting ,
enough !
i believe we' ve got something now .
a bulletproof uniform .
the material is as light as silk .
where ?
i' ve arranged for a demonstration .
it will only take two minutes .
i can spare one .
professor herr kibitzen .
actions speak louder than words .
a bulletproof uniform .
one hundred percent perfect .
shoot !
far from perfect .
where' s my secretary ?
in the outer office .
call her .
take a letter .
herring here in the tower room , we' ve got something marvellous ,
i shall be up .
a parachute .
the most compact in the world .
worn like a hat .
it will open in 25 feet .
demonstrate , professor .
herring , why do you waste my time like this ?
send garbitsch here .
herr garbitsch is waiting ,
enough !
what' s the meaning of this ?
25 million for prison camps ?
we need to manufacture munitions .
we' ve made a few arrests .
how many ?
five or ten thousand ... a day .
a day ?
just a few dissenters .
dissenting about ?
working hours , wage cuts , the synthetic food , the quality of the sawdust in the bread .
what more do they want ?
it' s from the finest lumber !
nevertheless , the people are overworked .
they need diversion .
the people , bah !
we might go further with the jews .
burn some of their houses .
an assault on the ghetto .
something more dramatic .
when can we be ready to invade osterlich ?
three months .
i can' t wait .
napaloni' s army might invade first .
we must strike now .
we' il require foreign capital .
borrow it !
the bankers have refused .
epstein .
epstein ?
he' s a jew , isn' t he ?
yes .
well , let' s be big about it .
we' il borrow from epstein .
it might be difficult in view of our policy towards his people .
then we' il change our policy .
tell schultz all persecution of the jews must cease .
at least till we' ve negotiated this loan .
i don' t understand it .
the whole ghetto is so quiet .
you can' t imagine what was going on .
this hynkel business .
you weren' t here , you were in the hospital , unconscious .
you don' t appreciate what a good time you were having .
if things get worse we can go to osterlich .
that' s still free .
sooner or later we' il have to go .
anyway , it' s nice to see you back .
it' s like the old days again , eh ?
how' s business ?
very slow .
the men are in concentration camp .
you should fix up the women .
the beauty parlour business .
know anything about it ?
you can learn .
you can practise on hannah .
hannah , get in that chair , we' il make you look beautiful .
what for ?
he' s going to practise on you .
not with mud on my face ?
no , we' il take some off .
make me look beautiful ?
sure .
he can' t make you look any worse !
mrs shoemaker' s laundry !
i' il give it to her .
you sit here and enjoy yourself .
i know .
i' ve seen you making eyes .
don' t pay any attention to him .
i like your shop since it' s fixed up .
i wish i had a business like this .
there' s no future in housework .
maybe if i save my money i can have a barbershop some day .
but i can never save .
money slips through my fingers .
i' ve always lived up to every penny i' ve earned .
why shouldn' t i ?
you' re here today and gone tomorrow .
do you believe in god ?
i do .
but if there wasn' t one , would you live any different ?
i wouldn' t .
life could be wonderful if people' d leave you alone .
things are looking brighter now .
maybe because of you saving schultz .
funny how they' ve left us alone .
too good to be true .
do you ever daydream ?
i do .
that' s the only time i' m really happy : dreaming .
sometimes i get so carried away i don' t know what i' m doing .
aren' t you like that ?
we' re very much alike .
both absent minded .
you think so ?
i like absent minded people .
like the man who put his watch in boiling water and held the egg !
all great men are absent minded .
it' s a sign you' re smart .
my folks didn' t think so .
you have an excuse .
you were injured in the war .
i was born that way .
i wonder why women never grow whiskers .
isn' t that foolish of me ?
i could kick myself in the shins , i could ...
i' il give you a shampoo .
ain' t i cute ?
how did you do it ?
you should try it on yourself .
fixed up , you' d look handsome .
four pecks a pound , new potatoes !
the potato man !
i have to go .
take it easy there .
did you hurt yourself ?
careful next time .
here' s another one .
how do you do ?
something' s happened .
the storm troopers helped me up .
how wonderful if they stopped hating us , if they let us go about our business like we used to .
how wonderful if we didn' t have to go to another country .
i don' t want to go .
with all the persecution , i still love it here .
perhaps we don' t have to go .
wouldn' t it be wonderful if they' d let us live and be happy again ?
full stop .
nothing works !
not even a sharp pencil .
i' m surrounded by incompetent , stupid , sterile stenographers .
i' il get you a pen .
don' t bother !
i won' t send it .
get out , get out !
we' ve just discovered the most wonderful poison gas .
it will kill everybody ...
all right .
later .
b76 to see herr herring ,
a lady .
my secret agent .
your secret agent ?
tell her to come here .
have b76 come right in .
any news from epstein ?
our agent reports that all the board of directors are aryans .
the loan' s bound to go through .
good .
a strike at the arms factory .
the leader ?
five of them .
have them shot .
they were .
how many were going to strike ?
three thousand of them .
have them all shot .
i don' t want dissatisfied workers .
these men are skilled craftsmen .
let' s train others first , then shoot them !
cannot afford to be lenient .
the rhythm of production will be affected .
rhythm ...
all right , have your rhythm .
spare the strikers and permit them to return to work .
but mark them for future reference .
that' s my department .
i' il attend to that .
this way .
the strike leaders are all brunettes .
not one blond .
troublemakers !
worse than jews .
then wipe them out !
" doucement " .
we' il get rid of the jews first , then concentrate on the brunettes .
we shall never have peace till we have a pure aryan race .
how wonderful !
tomainia , a nation of blue eyed blonds .
why not a blond europe , asia , america ?
and a brunette dictator .
of the world !
why not ?
aut caesar aut nullus .
the world' s effete , worn out , afraid .
no nation would dare oppose you .
dictator of the world !
it' s your destiny .
we' il kill off the jews , wipe out the brunettes , then will come forth a pure aryan race .
beautiful blond aryans .
they will love you , they will worship you as a god .
no , you mustn' t say it .
you make me afraid of myself .
dictator of the world !
we' il invade osterlich first .
after that we can bluff .
the nations will capitulate .
the world will be under your thumb .
leave me !
i want to be alone .
aut caesar aut nullus ,
emperor of the world !
my world .
the happy hour programme ,
work with the rhythm of music ,
brahms ' hungarian dance number five ,
fifteen cents , please .
happy hour signing off ,
at six , adenoid hynkel will address the children of the double cross ,
it seems like the old days again .
how long is it going to last ?
in the papers it' s rumoured that hynkel' s going to give the jews back their rights .
maybe .
what do you want ?
business is much better .
nobody interferes with us any more .
doesn' t that make you feel good ?
the trouble , mr jaeckel , is you' re so used to bad times , you' re unhappy without them .
get my sunday shoes .
they' re on the windowsill .
i can' t find the shawl .
i' ve got a shawl .
what' s going on ?
they' re dressing hannah up to go out .
is that so ?
she' s got a beau .
who is it ?
the barber .
now , turn around .
my dear !
those hands !
what' s the matter with them ?
those calluses .
they' re so rough .
maybe i better not go .
don' t be foolish .
he knows you do housework .
wait !
i' il get a pair of mittens .
see if he' s ready .
not yet .
he' s polishing a bald man' s head .
bad news .
the invasion of osterlich will have to be delayed .
what ?
epstein refuses to lend the money .
epstein refuses , eh ?
send for schultz .
epstein refuses .
what did he say ?
he complained of the persecution and said he wouldn' t have any dealings with a mediaeval maniac .
he' il deal with a mediaeval maniac more than he thinks !
first i shall deal with his people .
your excellency ?
call out the storm troopers .
a little mediaeval entertainment in the ghetto !
at such a time i think it ill advised .
such demonstrations demoralise the country .
indeed ?
since when do you care about the ghetto ?
i speak in the interests of our party and the cause of humanity .
you need a holiday .
fresh air .
a little outdoor exercise .
i' il send you to a concentration camp .
place schultz under arrest .
very well , but remember my words .
your cause is doomed to failure because it is built on the stupid persecution of innocent people .
your policy is worse than a crime .
it' s a tragic blunder .
traitor !
traitor !
you' re a double dyed democrat !
schultz , why have you forsaken me ?
excellency , here are the notes for your speech .
i' il not need them .
