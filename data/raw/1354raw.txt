this bird mcclure will be pie for him .
he' il twist him around his little finger .
don' t kid yourself .
nobody' s squaring nothing with mcclure .
not even the big boy .
small jobs , that' s different .
we could spring guys for them .

it' s guys like this torpedo of yours that cause all the trouble .

i was up worried .
i don' t want to take any chances .

what do you mean ?
are you trying to kid me or something ?
how can i take the chance ?
they' re all my friends , they all know me .

but not when we got there .
he beat it .
but we got a good description of him , though .
i' m telling you , i don' t know nothing about it .
well , come on , fellas .
as long as vettori doesn' t know anything about it .
oh , say , have you heard the news , vettori ?
no , what ?
someone knocked off alvin mcclure over at the bronze peacock .
mcclure ?

some guys are sure careless with the lead , all right .
what a tough break for arnie .
it' s gonna be a tough break for a lot of birds .
well , so long .
oh , i forgot to wish you fellas a merry christmas .
tony , i can' t figure him .
the kid' s a great driver .

yeah , well i bossed this job ... ... and i' m gonna get my split .
how' d you boss this job ?
by sitting here cheating at solitaire ?
well , that don' t go no more , not with me .

i' ve taken orders from you too long .
you' il keep on taking orders too ... ... or you' il get out of here so fast ...
maybe it won' t be me that gets out .
no ?
well , maybe the boys have got something to say about that .
what about it ?
so , that' s it , huh ?
yeah , that' s it , all right .
you can dish it out , but you' re getting so you can' t take it no more .
you' re through .
well ?
well , the split' s okay with me , rico .
how about you boys ?
no hard feelings , sam ?
we gotta stick together .
there' s a rope around my neck right now , and they only hang you once .

hey , rico , what become of that pal of yours , that dancer guy , joe massara ?
he didn' t come .
he ain' t been around in a long time .
he didn' t quit on you , did he , rico ?
bad business to quit on me , sam .
one guy tried that on me once .
now , you mind your own business and let me tend to my own .
what does that bull want in here ?
i' il show him where he gets off .
careful , rico .
who invited you here ?
you' re getting up in the world , aren' t you , rico ?
the downstairs is open to anybody , even cops .
but the upstairs is private .
thanks , but i like to keep my eye on you , rico .
you see , i' m your friend .
i like to see a young fellow getting up in the world ... ... that' s all .
so long .
hurry back .
i will .
oh , say ...
somebody threw a brick through meyer blum' s window last night .
do you happen to know anything about a diamond and platinum watch ... ... that was stolen , do you ?
if you hear anything about it , let me know , won' t you ?
banquet , eh ?
rico got far ... ... too far .
so now , he' s got to stop .
i' m saying he' s got to stop !
oh , arnie , are you fellas going to start another scrap ?
what' s the use of my paying heavy dues for protection if there' s no peace ?
don' t worry .
there' il be peace soon enough .
i' m saying he' s got to stop , so he' s gonna stop .
he' s been cutting in on my territory ... ... and that' s all wet with me .
look .
i' m sitting here , see ?
i' m sitting here quiet ... ... smoking a cigarette , see ?
but a couple of my boys ain' t sitting here .
they' re out looking for rico , and they got their gats with them too .
catch on ?
and when they find him , it won' t be no banquet that rico gets .
it will be a wake !
arnie , you know best .
i' ve never met rico .
phelps , 2284 .
hello , otero .
this is joe massara .
i just found out something .
this is hot .
tell rico to look out .
little arnie' s gang is out to put one in him .
what' s the matter ?
where is rico ?

he ain' t showed up yet .
come on , quick !
we got to find him !
i want 10 of these .
gee , you taking all these papers , mr. rico ?
why , sure .
ain' t i got my picture in them ?
here .
thanks !
come again !
that' s all right .
fine shots you are !
oh , no !
so somebody finally put one in you .
yeah , but they just grazed me .
the old man will be glad to hear it .
he takes such an interest in you .
tell him the cops couldn' t get me no other way , so they hired gunmen .
if i wasn' t on the force , i' d have done the job cheap .
did you ever think how you' d look with a lily in your hand ?
no , i never did .
i' ve been in this game many years , and i put the cuffs on a lot of mugs .
someday , you and i are gonna take a ride , rico ... ... and when we do , i' il have the cuffs on you too .
no buzzard like you will ever put any cuffs on rico .

if you think you can muscle in like you did on sam vettori , you' re off your nut !
i suppose you forgot all about pete montana , huh ?
how' s diamond pete going to stop me ?
he may be your boss , but he ain' t mine .
sam didn' t feel that way about him .

sam was too soft .
diamond pete could scare him , but i ain' t no sam .
sam is through .

gee , boss .
you gave arnie an awful walloping .
rico ...

the bigger they come , the harder they fall .
yeah .
i ain' t doing so bad in this business so far .
well , now .
you look great , boss .
yeah , but it feels terrible .
you' re getting up in the world , rico .
none of us ever been invited up to eat at the big boy' s dump .
and nobody ever crashed the gate except pete montana .
see what i mean ?
now , you don' t want the big boy to think you ain' t got no class .
they rig you up better than this in the stir .
if you think i' m going out in this , you' re crazy !
you look fine , boss .

oh , i don' t know .
all i need is a napkin over my arm .

you know me .
all right .
get this .
pete montana' s through .
yeah ?
well .
and i thought he was such a big guy .
he' s through .
suppose i were to tell you that from now on ... ... you were pete montana .
that you were to take over his territory in addition to your own .
would you shake on it ?
would i ?
would i ?
all right .
it' s set .
i' m doing a lot for you , rico , but when i get you planted ... ... i' il expect plenty of service .
well , you' il sure get it .
permit me , then , to drink to the new boss of the north side .
thank you .
otero , what did i tell you , huh ?
i knew it was coming .
i knew he had his eyes on me all the time .
and let me tell you something , otero .
it' s not only pete montana that' s through , but the big boy himself .
he ain' t what he used to be .
pretty soon , he won' t be able to take it , and then ... ... watch me .
sure , boss .
pretty soon , you' il be running the whole town .
otero , you said a mouthful .
there' s a guy by the name of massara out there .
he wants to see you , sir .
i' il see him in a minute .
yes , sir .
what' s joe want here ?
he hasn' t been near any of us for months .
i sent for him .
i heard somebody in detroit got to flaherty and told him to start working ... ... on a dancer at the bronze peacock if he wanted to find out who shot mcclure .
gee , boss , you' re wise to everything before it happens .
yeah , i don' t miss much .
i' il find out if flaherty' s been working on joe after i have a little talk with him .
gee , rico , what a palace .
oh , hello , joe .
yeah , it' il do .
but what do you expect ?
ain' t i got 20 grand tied up in it ?
hello , otero .
how are you , baby ?
first rate .
sit down , joe .
sure i' m good enough to sit in such a swell chair ?
come on , now .
cut the comedy .
sit down .
screw , otero .
i want to talk with joe private .
sure .
see you later , joe .
cigar , joe ?
no , thanks .
well , will you have a cocktail or a dash of brandy ?
no .
well , it surprise you to hear from me ?
kind of .
i thought it would be kind of nice to have a little talk together ... ... like old times .
certainly is nice to see you , rico .
especially like this .
you' re looking good .
you' re looking good too , joe .
living easy , kind of , huh ?
not that easy .
dancing' s no cinch .
yeah , but you ain' t complaining .
no .
no , i ain' t complaining .
that' s good .
yeah .
dancing' s all right for a sideline .
it gives you a swell front .
but it ain' t my idea of a man' s game .
what' s the difference , rico ?
as long as i ain' t kicking , why should you kick ?
who' s kicking ?
only why should a young guy like you be wasting his time ?
and i kind of took pride in you , joe ... ... brought you into the gang , pushed you ahead .
but now you' re getting to be a sissy .
we got to go into that again ?
can' t you just forget about me ?
i don' t want to forget , joe .
you' re my pal .
we started off together , didn' t we ?
we' ve got to keep going along together .
who else do i got to give a hang about ?
i need you , joe .
i' ve got the biggest chance of my life .
the big boy just handed me the whole north side ... ... but it' s too much for one man to handle alone .
i need somebody .
a guy like you , somebody i can trust .
can' t be me , rico .
i' ve quit .
you didn' t quit .
nobody ever quit me .
you' re still in my gang , you got that ?
i don' t care how many fancy skirts you' ve got hanging on to you .
that jane' s made a softy out of you .
you lay off olga .
i ain' t laying off .
i' m after her !
one of us has to lose , and it won' t be me .
there' s ways of stopping that dame .
you' re crazy .
leave her out of this !
she' s through , out of the way .
you' re lying .
you wouldn' t dare !
i wouldn' t ?
i' il show you !
rico , listen .
we' re in love with one another .
don' t that mean nothing ?
nothing .
less than nothing .
love .
soft stuff !
when she' s got you , you ain' t no good for anything .
we ain' t out of this yet ... ... and we don' t want no softies spilling things !
i won' t spill anything , if you' re scared of that .
you think i want my neck stretched ?
well , you know too much .
i ain' t gonna take any chances .
you' re hanging around with me , see ?
no , i' m not .
all right .
you go back to that dame ... ... and it' s suicide .
suicide for both of you .
just stick here .
hello ?
oh , hello , big boy .
no .
no , i don' t want that guy .
i don' t trust him .
yeah .
i got a kid by the name of joe massara who' il help me .
yeah .
all right , goodbye , big boy .
oh , joe ...

olga .

joe , what' s the matter ?
didn' t you hear what i said ?
hurry !
hurry !
yes , joe .
oh , you' re ill .
i' m all right .
rico .
what did he do to you ?
oh , didn' t i know it ?
he , rico ...
he said you and me gotta quit .
he' d kill you unless i stuck with him .
i ran away .
we' ve got to get out of here .
anywhere .
as long as we get away !
no .
no ?
you' re not coming ?
no .
that' s not the way .
but , olga , you don' t know that guy !
olga , you' ve got to !
please !
no .
sit down , joe .
we' ve got to think .
i don' t want to think or sit down .
you' re coming .
don' t you see ?
it would be no use !
where ?
where would we go ?
where would we run to ?
there' s no place he wouldn' t find us .
there' s only one thing for us to do .
flaherty .
you' re crazy .
you think that would save us ?
flaherty ?
that' s worse than suicide .
i won' t do it .
i can' t .
well , i can do it .
that gang must go .
rico must go .
i want my happiness , joe .
i want you .
we' il never have peace till rico' s gone .
i' m going to do it .
olga , don' t !
please !

olga , open this door !
olga , open this door !

i don' t know , but we' il find out when we get there .

i got enough on them to use a mile of rope .
shoot the cars right out , and above all , get rico .
we' ve gotta watch our step .
the cops are sure to be cruising around .
you should have plugged joe .
and the dame .
if they ain' t squealed about mcclure yet , they' il do it now .
from now on , we' re hot .
yeah .
this is what i get for liking a guy too much .
come on .

you' d better give up , sam .
drop that gun before we start shooting .
come on in .
get on your feet and put your hands up .
put the cuffs on him .
you ain' t got nothing on me .
nothing but the bracelets .
and we haven' t got a thing on rico , either .
he' s next .
there' s nobody in there .
no ?
well , listen , ma .
if you see rico , you' d better let us know , quick .
well ... ... you got yourself in a nice fix .
yeah .
the cops were just here .
they got otero .
ma , i' m gonna stay here a day or two , then i want a car .
gonna cost you big , because i' m taking big chances .
i got 10 grand planted here .
help yourself .
when you' re ready to start , i' il give you $ 150 .
you' il give me ?
whose money is this ?
who do you think you' re talking to ?
i need plenty .
my money is hidden in the apartment .
i can' t get to it .
i' il give you $ 150 .
take it or leave it .
why , you dirty , thieving old hag , i' il ...
no , you won' t .
because i' m the only one knows where the money' s hid .
kill me , and you won' t get a cent .
i' il give you $ 150 ... ... if you' il be a good boy .
he was mean , sam vettori was .
so now he' s got what was coming to him .
what does it say in the paper ?
former gang chief faints on scaffold .
after a futile battle in the courts ... ... sam vettori , former gang leader ... ... today presented a pitiful figure ... ... as the hangman' s noose was placed around his neck .
listen .
little caesar has never been found .
according to the statement of lieutenant thomas flaherty of the homicide squad ... ... little caesar , the once swaggering braggart of the underworld ... ... wilted in the face of real danger and showed the world his cowardice .
flaherty stated further that little caesar has contradicted his oft repeated boast ... ... that he could dish it out and take it too .
yeah .
when a real crisis arose ... ... rico couldn' t take it .
' meteoric as was rico' s rise from the gutter ... ... it was inevitable that he should return there . '
well , just the same , he was the real leader of that gang .
don' t you believe it .
rico didn' t have the nerve , and he didn' t have the brains .
he was yellow , just like flaherty said .
here !
that' s what rico ...
give me that paper !
hey , watch it !
what' s the matter with him ?
must be crazy .
i' il show them where they get off .
trying to put that kind of stuff about me in the papers , huh ?
i' il show them ...
hello ?
hello ?
i want park , 1000 .
yeah .
yeah , i can' t take it no more , huh ?
i' il tell that guy where to ...
hello ?
park , 1000 ?
get me flaherty , and get him quick .
sure .
just a minute .
tom .
oh , tom .
i may be screwy , but this sounds like rico .
yeah ?
flaherty speaking .
yeah , this is rico speaking !
rico !
r l c o , rico !
little caesar , that' s who !
you' re a big guy , ain' t you ?
shooting your mouth off in the papers .
so i ran out when it got hot , huh ?
i can' t take it no more ?
well , listen , you crummy , flatfooted copper ... ... i' il show you whether i lost my nerve .
thanks , rico , old boy .
the same to you and many of them .
come on , tell me some more .
the sound of your voice does my heart good .
trace that call .
find out where he' s phoning from , quick .
say , why didn' t you come to sam' s neck stretching party , rico ?
it was a big success .
funny guy , ain' t you , flaherty ?
well , you ain' t got much longer to laugh .
i' m coming , and i' m gonna put one in your dirty hide ... ... for every lying crack that you made about me , see ?
i' il show you who' s gonna finish up in the gutter .
we' ve missed you , rico .
the town has been nice and quiet .
i' m putting on weight .
river , 6547 .
it' s a flophouse down at 4th and commercial .
all right .
all right , big mouth .
get your hat and start running , see , because you' re all through .
call the papers and tell them that , you rotten , dirty , lying copper !
i knew we' d hear from that guy if i kept giving it to him in the papers .
the conceit of that guy !
they' il have to build a special noose to get that swelled head of his through .
well , wish me luck .
there he is .
that' s rico , all right .
pull in there .
you' d better give up , rico .
you haven' t got a chance .
you' il have to come and get me .
you' d better be a nice boy , rico , and come out .
you heard me !
if you want me , come and get me !
i' il be with you in a minute .
give me that chopper .
this is your last chance , rico .
are you coming out , or do you want to be carried out ?
well , rico , it looks like you and i are going to take that little ride together .
no ...
no , we ain' t .
i told you a little buzzard like you will never put any cuffs on me .
you should have come out when i told you to , rico .
mother of mercy .
is this the end of rico ?
