dead , i' m the one exterminating son slipping through the trees strangling the breeze
dead , i' m the sky watching angels cry as they slowly turn conquering the worm
dead i' m the pool spreading from the fool weakened want you need nowhere as you bleed
dead i' m the rat feast upon the cat tender is the fur dying as you purr
it' s never quite that easy .
you go through the door , and they' re never just sitting there waiting for you ... with a welcoming smile on their face .
best you can do is hope they fuck up ... and do what you can to be there when they do .
and then blame yourself for the killings ?
oh , no .
i blame the asshole who did them .
this man' s whole life is about killing .
he studies it .
he knows forensics .
he understands police procedure .
he prepares methodically so as to not to leave any evidence at the scene .
after he picks his target , he' il watch her for weeks .
he' il study every detail of her routine
when she comes home .
when she goes to sleep .
in the morning before the sun comes up , he can walk right up next to her .
even though the sun' s still down , no one perceives it as night .
women who are careful at midnight , walk around half naked seven hours later .
finally , he' il pick a day .
takes a kit of tools and props duct tape , handcuffs , a weapon whatever he needs .
he' il let himself in .
that night , she' il get home .
go about her business , unaware that he' s in the house .
oh ... this is good .
shall we dance ?
no , don' t play hard to get .
this will be fun .
shh .
shh .
it' s over .
it' s all right .
shh .
i said , " shut ... up .
when she passes out ... from foreordain , he' il revive her over and over again to
um
what were you going to say ?
time' s up .
joel .
why did you turn away from me ?
why was it so hard for you to accept ?
' cause you know i did it for you .
you came so close to me that night .
i remember clearly what i felt when i heard your footsteps following behind me .
pride .
i thought it would keep us together forever .
for me , it was our finest moment .
i can still see the flames .
oh !
shit .
what the fuck ?
oh , fuck !
i didn' t see anything .
wanda , you wanna run that in to sarge ?
right on it .
hey , i' m detective mackie .
welcome to my crime scene .
can i help you find anything ?
i' m just going home .
i live upstairs .
did you not happen to notice that yellow police tape marked " do not cross " ?
if you' re done with that , i' il just take it and go home . do you know this woman ?
i' ve never seen her .
what happened ?
is she dead ?
oh , i haven' t made any reference to homicide .
why would you hasten to such a conclusion ?
well , you got half the block taped off , and you got what , about a dozen cops in there , fuckin ' up your crime scene ?
it just doesn' t seem like someone boosting stereos to me .
look here .
give me a call if you think of anything .
all right ?
hello .
yeah , this is hollis .
hello .
this is campbell .
i' m the guy we met last night .
yeah , joel campbell .
our ex f. b. i. friend from apartment 805 .
we did a little checking on you after you left .
what can i do for you ?
i can hardly are you busy ?
it sounds like you' re in the middle of something .
yeah , some genius jacked a honda a couple blocks ago .
that' s an ' 86 .
what , do you want me to call you back ?
no .
when did she die , the girl ?
monday night .
three days ago .
why ?
' cause i know who did it .
and how might you know that ?
he mailed me a picture of her still alive .
i got it three days ago monday morning .
hold on a minute , campbell .
teen hoodis on the run .
okay .
sorry to keep you .
now ... you wanna meet me back at my office ?
all right .
is it your custom to open your mail four days after you get it ?
nope .
sometimes it takes up to two weeks .
well , this would appear ... to answer any questions we had whether these two cases were related .
goodness gracious .
nothin ' like a good serial killing to kick off the holiday season .
right in here .
gimme a minute in that room .
okay , lieutenant .
we got him sending his pictures in the mail .
campbell , hell , we oughta get bob barker in on this son of a bitch .
it' s a damn game show .
his last alias was david allen griffin .
i worked the case for three and a half years in los angeles .
we attributed at least 11 homicides to him .
what' s he doing in chicago ?
i assume he' s still strangling young women with piano wire .
all the victims were left partially unclothed , and all the swabs came back negative .
exactly .
no touchy , no feely .
have you ever seen this guy ?
no .
no one' s ever seen him .
well , then we can' t necessarily conclude it' s the same fella , can we ?
come on .
he sent me fuckin ' pictures .
shoved the vic right up my ass in my own fucking building .
sorry .
it' s quite all right .
you looked adorable .
this film stock says it' s for exterior sunshine , but ... how does it handle in fluorescence ?
uh , i' m sorry .
i have no idea what you' re talking about .
i just work here .
you do film processing here .
uh , yeah , one hour .

what are you doing ?
i' m going to test it out .
i' m gonna shoot some pictures , and you' re going to process them for me .
perfect .
yeah , chief of chicago p. d. already called .
not surprising , i suppose , they' re inviting us in on this .
they' re setting up a joint task force as we speak .
i' d like to know if you think you can handle it on our end .
i know that in l. a.
oh , no , this isn' t l. a.
it' s not my job anymore .
you know what ?
the only reason that your burnt out , messed up ass ... is standing in my office is because you had a three year head start on us .
this perp is set on putting you in the middle of this shit whether we like it or not .
you' re right .
the field office in l. a. has the relevant files .
i can' t tell you anything that' s not in them .
i' m sorry .
mike .
excuse me .
mike , we got several sets of prints off the fedex envelope and the photo itself .
i' m sorry .
this is none of my business , but , uh , you can run the prints .
you' re gonna get me , the driver , three guys from the warehouse ,
santa claus ... a whole bunch of elves .
definitely not this guy .
who the hell is that ?
run it .
yes , sir .
ooh ooh can' t anybody see
well , you' re young .
do you plan to live on disability your whole life ?
i take 200 milligrams of seconal just so i can sleep two and a half hours a night .
twice a day , i take 400 milligrams of acebutolol ... and 20 milligrams of lotensen for high blood pressure .
i self inject migraine medicine whenever the fuck i please .
they don' t ... mix well with work .
hmm .
maybe you' re just afraid .
fuckin ' right .
i am afraid .
okay .
let' s talk about that .
i go places , and i forget why i' m there .
i miss exits on the freeway .
i' m lucky to ... find my way home from the grocery store .
and if i do , then ... most of the time i' ve forgotten my groceries .
but yet , you make it here every week .
twice a week .
yeah .
you do .
what if the next picture that arrived was of your daughter ?
would you really want me to be the one looking for her ?
yes .

from this moment how can it feel this wrong
hello .
hi .
it' s me .
me ?
me who ?
it' s freaking cold here .
why' d you move here ?
what the fuck do you want from me ?
you hardly leave your apartment .
and when you do , it' s to eat ... at that same terrible vietnamese restaurant night after night .
you seem so bored .
i was expecting a warmer welcome .
i didn' t fuckin ' ask you here , did i ?
the guy they replaced you with
i tried to make it work , but we just didn' t see eye to eye at all .
i was going to quit the game entirely , but then i thought , " chicago' s not so bad .
at least you didn' t move to new jersey , right ?
yeah .
so , why don' t you grab a pen ?
i' il give you the name and number of the ... agent that' s on your case .
you can ... share your inner turmoil with him ' cause i don' t give a shit .
i know your job is hard , joel , so i' m willing to take steps to try and make things work between us .

thank you .

i' il send you a picture , and you can have a day to try to find her .
no , i' ve never seen her .

i haven' t made any reference to homicide .
why would you hasten to such a conclusion ?
are you just afraid ?
fuckin ' right .
i' m afraid .
what if the next picture that arrived was of your daughter ?
really want me to be the one looking for her ?
yes .
i' il send you a picture .
you can have a day to try to find her .

there is shit else we can do for this woman .
let' s get him in front of the cameras .

hey .
hey !
get outta here .
murder suspect heading west on commerce , near the intersection of lincoln .
blue , two door sedan , mid ' 80s , maybe a ford .
fuck !
goddamn it !
i' m standing outside the apartment of ellie buckner , the woman who chicago has come to know as " jane doe .
the harrowing search came to a tragic end about 9 : 20 p. m. , when police discovered buckner' s body at her wicker park apartment .
it is a murder that has shocked this quiet neighborhood .
right
see you later .
bye .
excuse me .
i can' t stay long .
i just wanted to come by ... and tell you how much i appreciate ... what you ... said the other day .
how have the headaches been ?
about the same .
are you sleeping ?
some .
how' s work ?
it' s great .
i' m building an excellent fan base with the homicidal set .
how do you feel about that , about this man following you to chicago ?
is it a vendetta ?
that' s a strange question .
no , i don' t think vengeance has anything to do with it .
i think there' s a story , a ritual that he follows .
over the years , i became part of the story .
it probably didn' t make sense without me .
in other words , he missed you .
odd , isn' t it ?
did you miss him ?
what the hell does that mean ?
excuse me .
sorry .
campbell .
we received another photo .
i' il be right there .
where is she sitting ?
let' s get somebody from the city up here .
see if they can tell us something about this section of sidewalk .
is this the " el " here , you know ?
parking meters .
yep , i' m on it .
mitch , let' s get her picture in tattoo parlors .
got it .
what' s your name ?
well , usually , mr. abraham ,
i do an introductory session , where we both explore what you hope to get out of therapy .
if we both feel i' m the person to provide that for you , then we can decide on a schedule together .
and and i like to record my sessions .
but if you prefer
is that something that you do with all of your patients ?
yeah , with most of them .
would you prefer that i didn' t ?
yes , i' d rather you not .
okay .
that' s that' s fine .
so , you say that you might need help .
in in what area ?
i' m not sure .
what kind of help do you provide ?
well , i i work with patients on many different issues .
do you think ... some of your patients ... might pay to come and see you because ... you' re very pretty ?
let' s keep this focused on you , rather than on me , mr. abraham .
sure .
nice trick .
i' m gonna try it again though , okay ?
yeah , whatever .
a couple of years ago , they did a neighborhood renovation ... where they put those benches around some of the trees downtown .
where downtown ?
bring up the city .
basically the broadway and belmont area .
that' s 15 to 20 city blocks .
yeah .
there are five million people in this city .
how can no one have known this person ?
can you spare some change ?
how can this happen in the communication age ?
authorities have focused the search for " jane doe # 2 "
hey , dad .
dad , it' s me .
don' t you recognize me ?
leave me alone .
come on , pop .
i need you , man .
the city of chicago is on alert .
police are searching for a woman connected to the photograph they have received .
it appears the murder may be linked to a serial killer in the los angeles area .
at this point , the woman police are calling " jane2 " ... has not yet been located ...
and all those involved are very concerned about her well being .
yeah .
we' ve got jane doe' s mother on the phone .
i' il be right there .
you know what ?

belmont .
belmont .

she said all kinds of things .
i never knew what to believe .
she has a new boyfriend .
so tell me about the boyfriend .
he' s a lawyer .
yeah , right .
can you remember anything else about the calls ?
anything might help .
a few months ago , she called to announce she' s got a job at seattle' s best coffee .
seattle' s best ?
seattle' s best ?
not good news .
she does not work , nor has she ever worked at seattle' s best .
i don' t care whether she works there or not , she is sitting in front of a coffee shop .
i don' t know .
it looks like a bench to me .
it could be anywhere .
i' il be honest with you .
look at the photo .
there are seven people in the picture .
three of them are holding the same kind of coffee cup .
she' s sitting in front of a fucking coffee shop .
get someone into every seattle' s best in the city ... and any place that sells coffee in the broadway belmont area .
take a look at this .
okay .

okay , okay .

did you move 2, 000 miles to live near this woman' s grave ?
you did , didn' t you ?

i mean , is this a satisfying relationship ?
you know , she loves me .
she' s decomposing .
she loves me .
she' s decomposing .
what are we doing here ?
what is this ?
you here to give yourself up ?
why didn' t you tell anyone you were fucking her ?
just ' cause she was married ?
we don' t seem to be communicating .
let me be clear with you .
i have no problem with shooting you dead where you sit .
well , you do have one problem .
if i' m dead , your friend polly is going to meet a rather gruesome fate ... involving candlelight and quite a large pool of kerosene .
and you know something about attractive women burning , don' t you ?
tell me , what was it like ?
could you smell her flesh burning ?
you' ve already killed her .
come on .
you know me better than that .
that' s not even her blood .
take me to see her then .
oh , i don' t know about that .
can' t we just sit here for a little while and talk , joel ?
we' il talk once i see her .
i just need to know if there' s anything to talk about .
go on , take it .
i just need to see that she' s all right , then we' il talk .
well , fine .
let' s go .
it' s good to see you , joel .
it really is .
wow , it' s loaded .
we' re going to make it through this , aren' t we , joel ?
i think that' s more up to you than it is to me .
you look older since you were in l. a.
you' re a good friend .
you' re like a brother to me .
did you know that ?
do you have any real brothers or sisters ?
what the fuck what is that ?
i' m trying to have a real conversation , and you' re psychoanalyzing me .
what are you , dr. polly now ?
i was just curious .
look at me when i talk to you .
you' re trying to control this situation .
stop trying to control this situation .
can' t you just leave your job out of this ? just this once ?
i' m telling you .
i think you' re spending too much time with that polly bitch .
what do you need ?
i want you to think about what you need .
it' s up to me to try and get that and make an exchange .
anything you need for ms. beilman' s safety .
what i need is you .
hold on .
hello .
i knew if i just came here and talked to you in person , you' d understand me better , joel .
fuck me , he' s got campbell !

you were the only one who thought about me , who really knew me .
for a long time ,
i was the only one you had .
and then you met lisa .
pull in here .
give me a second .

yeah , you' re gonna have to do better than that .

i got him !
i got him .
he' s right on the water .
come on in .
polly , joel .

roots in hell and time will tell if your baby is insane a child bride with bloody eyes and satan on the brain
wakey , wakey , joel .
that hurts , doesn' t it ?
i' ve heard that flashing lights and migraines don' t go together at all .
you' re no fun .
oh , no , polly .
no , no , i' m not gonna kill him .
we need each other .
we define each other .
we' re ... yin and yang , black and white .
isn' t that right , polly ?
polly ?
i said , " isn' t that right ?
i don' t understand the question .
did you or did you not , in your professional opinion , reach the conclusion that joel and i need each other in order to give meaning to our lives ?
yes .
yes , but i
see ?
take your fucking hands off her .
i said take your fucking hands off her .
sit down , joel .
sit down .
i' il sit here and listen to you talk all night .
just take your hands off her .
come on , put the fucking gun down .
we both know you' re not gonna do it .
and why do we know that ?
because you can only kill her once .
he' s right .
he' s right .
upsy daisy .
how' s this for deja vu ?
we' ve got the fire .
we' ve got the pretty girl .
only instead of bringing us together , you move to chicago .
the guilt must have been unbearable .
or something like that .
is that what you want me to say ?
i feel guilty a woman is dead because i made a terrible mistake .
no .
no , no .
that wasn' t the mistake .
the mistake was turning back instead of pouring all you had into us .
what do i want you to say ?
i want you to say thank you .
i want you to say thank you for coming here and saving your pathetic life .
david , do you know how many serial killers are active in chicago right now ?
five .
in the midwest , at least a dozen .
i could work on any one of them without even packing a bag .
you get hit by a bus on a thursday , i' m working on a new guy on monday .
you' re my job .
you' re paperwork .
i can' t believe you still don' t know who you' re talking to .
no , no , no !
no , please don' t
i have to do this .
he' s not going to understand anything else .
you heard him .
paperwork .
thank you .
what did you say ?
i said , " thank you .
tell me again .
i said , " thank you .
get out of here .
let' s go !
run , run !
joel !
joel !
give me your hand !
reach for it !
ready ?
reach .
here you go .
you all right ?
give me that blanket .
where' s the girl ?
is she all right ?
she' s right over there .
let' s get the fucking body out .
okay .
it' s never quite that easy .
you go through the door .
they' re never just sitting there waiting for you with a welcoming smile on their face .
the best you can do is hope they fuck up and do what you can to be there when they do .
