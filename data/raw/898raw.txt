just ieave me alone .
you don' t even iook at me when i speak to you .
that title was mine again .
i won that competition fair and square .
roping two pigs together isn' t a talent fit for winning miss catch of the day .
no bloody way !
she iooked alright , though , in that outfit she was wearing .
maybe i don' t iook as good as you in a bikini right now ... with wayne junior on the way , but ... but i' ve got a singing voice iike an angei and if you hadn' t cheated ...
come on , sailyanne , i was broke !
that was the only reason i entered . ... and forget aii about your duties as queen .
you are to preserve the best interest of the town .
that ' s your no 1 priority .
ladies , you need to shut up with the girlie talk and calm down .
the situation is under control .
help wiii be here soon .
if you feei scared , just think of a happy place .
your folks ' farm always seemed to make you happy .
i' m having a turd of a day .
remember when we were kids ... your dad used to swing us on that tyre he hung from that tree ?
we were happy then , there was room to swing ... but you couldn' t swing a cat in here !

they want to feed off us .
we' re iike spam in a fuckin ' can ...
good job !
are we safe in here ?
no food , too many people .
and water , where' s your taps ?
no taps down here .
the bottled water is upstairs .
you don' t want to drink the tap water .
why ?
tap water is tank water ... tank water is rain water , the rain is aii part of this attack .
what ?
and there was this iight coming down from the clouds ... and it was sucking up bugs and stuff .
weii that explains it , a iight coming down sucking up bugs .
builshit !
weil , people hailucinate some times when they panic , i know i do .
it ' s probably just the sunlight coming through the clouds .
that ' s what it was .
that was no sunlight .
and the meteorites failing ?
i saw that .
the whole town saw that .
weil , i am no weather girl ... but i am sure this kind of thing happens aii the time .
you' re a fisherman .
we used to seii these in my store .
damn things sold better than the guns ever did .
it brings me good iuck .

it couldn' t be any worse .
listen to him ... if we go over the wail , we should go prepared .

roping two pigs together isn' t a talent fit forwinning miss catch of the day !
you know , you act crazy .
i' m just doing what i must do .
why do you believe you must do anything ?
you know why .
that alien story of yours .
yes , i was attacked .
i' ve heard that story before .
no , you haven' t .
i was almost eaten by their kiiler fish .
it aii seems so crazy .
giant wails , acid rain , zombies .
crazy has definitely come to this town for a visit .
after the fish attack they abducted me .
i must have fought them off somehow ...
i can' t remember how , but they threw me back to earth .
not only did i survive the fish attack and the abduction ...
i walked away without a scratch .
it ' s a gift , a power i have .
i must use it to fight , but i can' t do it alone .
there is no one ieft but us four .
jesus christ , babe , could you make any much fuckin ' noise ?
the other two are heading down the same track as the cops .
think about what you' ve just seen .
i am not crazy , the strongest ones are always the iast ones ieft . you have the same strength i have .
i don' t feei strong , i feei sick again .
i think the infection is in the air now .
moily ?
are you a fighter , fish queen ?
or are you zombie food ?
i just want things to be back to normai again .
i want my farm back .
then take it back .
take the whole town back .
alright , iet ' s go .
stop !
stop , save your builets .
mate , where did you hide those ?
go , go !
come on , iet ' s go .
come on !
get in , get in !
come on !
come on , come on , the ioopy prick' s gone .
get in !
come on .
god !
it ' s the rain , get your coat off .
ren , come on !
you stay here , alright ?
no , wayne , please don' t go .
i' ii be back , alright ?
what are you doing ?
we need this stuff .
here , take this .
wayne !
come on !
come on !
who are you , what ' s going on ?
wayne !
come on !
shit !
moily ?
i' m over the wail !
we have an explosion .
roger .
going to investigate .
send help over here .
i' ve found a body .
we need assistance , we need assistance !
over here !
there' s somebody over here !
we' ve found a body , looks like a police officer .
there' s nobody else ?
we' ve found one victim ...
looks like the pilot .
stay behind the barricades .
if you go through the barricade , you' il be shot .
if you go through the barricade you will be shot !
we will open fire !
the army is preventing anyone from entering or leaving ... the town of berkeley .
those who broke through the blockade this morning ... are now quarantined alongwith the rest of the town' s residents .
it is believed that fragments from the nierle comet ... created a meteor shower overthe township .
no evidence of the alleged plague sweeping through the town ...
has been reported since the departure of the alien craft .
at this point we can confirm that berkeley ... is the only community to be bombarded with these fragments .
it ' s a boy .
he' s fine .
good .
i' m sure wayne wiii be okay .
nurse , nurse !
i' ve been shot .
someone shot me !
someone shot me !
someone shot me !
aii those people ... they wouldn' t have died if we didn' t shoot them .
i think you are forgetting the whole thing ... when they were trying to rip off our heads and suck out our brains .
your wounds from the fish attack that magicaily heeled ... the rain did that , didn' t it ?
aliens are the saviours , not us .
one day you' re out on your boat , you get attacked by zombie fish .
they munch at your face ...
iike you are the main course at a crazy country boy buffet .
you walk away , teii the town your story ... they think you' re mad , everyone thinks you' re mad .
you think i' m mad .
no , you' re not mad .
it happens again ... this time it ' s not zombie fish , it ' s zombie berkeley .
but this time i' m prepared .
i' m ready to fight whatever they can throw at me .
stiil , i wasn' t strong enough .
the strongest ones are always the iast ones ieft .
if that ' s not me , it must be you .
i' m just a fish queen , nothing more .
if that was the case , you wouldn' t have battled the undead and iived .
you would have been the entre on a smorgasboard of brain food .
take care , marion .
brings me good luck .
you call this good luck ?
the outbreak moved faster this time .
it spread so quickly , it couldn' t be stopped .
it spread beyond berkeley and across the country .
those that i could save from the medical centre are here now .
safe .
at least forthe time being .
the last couple of months have been nothing but clear skies .
the aliens haven' t come back , maybe some day they will .
until then , i must contain the infection .
sallyanne said that my first duty as catch of the day winner ... is to preserve the best interests of the town .
