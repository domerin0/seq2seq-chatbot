what' s your pleasure , mr. cotton ?
the box .
take it , it' s yours .
it always was .
it' s gotta be one of these .
i' m going to freeze to death .
okay , okay .
well , maybe somebody changed the lock .
well , that' s crazy .
who' s gonna change this lock ?
well , i don' t know .
it was just a suggestion .
ah !
success .
voila !
well , this is it .
the old homestead .
oh !
it smells damp .
well , it' s ... uh ... been empty for a while , hasn' t it ?
but we' il soon warm it up . and get it feeling like a home .
how long since you were here ?
oh , the better part of ten years .
i wanted to sell it after the old lady died , but i couldn' t get frank to agree .
i guess he needed a hideout or something .
would you look at this ?
and don' t worry , this stuff means nothing to me .
it all goes .
i thought half of it was your brother' s .
i' ve never known him to kick cash out of bed .
besides ... he' s probably behind bars some place .
you know ...
we' il have to let kirsty see this place before we do a thing to it .
she' il love it .
you really want to move in here ?
you don' t like it ?
i suppose it' s better than brooklyn .
oh , don' t start , julia .
don' t start what ?
look ... we can make it work here .
now i' ve got a terrific job , you' re back in your own turf .
we can be happy .

he says , " no , of course you' re not , old boy " .
the next thing i know , i' m on the floor , and he' s standing there like he' s the one that needs help .

i beg your pardon .
hey , we' re not al frigid .
oh , no ?

kirsty ?
kirsty ?
kirsty !

who was it ?
she had a bad dream .
who ?
kirsty .
kirsty .
not much fun , is it ?

drinking alone .
not much .
i thought maybe ... well ... as we' re both on our own , maybe we could have a drink together .
why not .
you know , it' s not often that ... you know .
there' s a first time for everything .
that' s right , yeah .
i suppose that' s right .
would you ... like a drink ?
oh , no , no , no .
i' m well over my limit . ?
you know , it' s funny , but ...
i ...
i feel like i' ve known you for years , you know .
what' s the matter ?
it' s what you brought me here for , isn' t it ?
well , isn' t it ?
i suppose so , yes .
so , what' s your problem ?
let' s get on with it .
you' re not going to change your fucking mind , are you ?
i' m sorry .
let' s go upstairs .
okay , okay , sorry , okay ?
okay .
right .
this isn' t the bedroom ..
no .
so , what' s going on ?
we don' t need a bed , do we ?
well , no , i suppose not .
i' ve always preferred the floor .
oh , first time for everything , eh ?
why don' t you take your jacket off ?
yeah , why don' t i ?
why don' t you do the same thing ?
maybe i will .
you' re very beautiful .
am i ?
oh , you know you are .
the loveliest woman i' ve ever seen .
oh , christ !
what' s wrong ?
one minute .
too much drink .
have to empty the old bladder .
did you lock this ?
please !
please !
don' t look at me .
jesus christ !
see ? .
it' s making me whole again .
every drop of blood you spill puts more flesh on my bones .
and we both want that , don' t we ?
good . !
come here .
come here , damn you , i want to touch you .
come to daddy .
julia !
julia !
come out , come out , wherever you are .
julia , i was calling for you .
didn' t you hear ?
are you in there ?
do you want a cookie , little girl ?
i' m feeling sick .
oh , babe .
is there anything i can get you ?
maybe a brandy .
it' s coming right up .
i' il be down in a minute .
okay .
there' s no hurry .
frank ?
i' m hurting .
hurting ?
my nerves are beginning to work again .
good .
one more .
maybe two .
not again .
to heal me completely .
then we can be away from here before they start to follow .
who ?
the cenobites .
it' s only a matter of time before they find i' ve slipped them .
i must get away from here .
julia ?
are you all right ?
just a moment .
put on some music , will you , babe ?
yeah , sure .
poor larry , obedient as ever .
keep your voice down .
you don' t want " babe " to hear .
you' re hurting .
you won' t cheat me , will you ?
you' il stay with me .
help me .
then we can be together the way we were before .
we belong to each other now .
for better , for worse .
make love , only real .
i' m sorry , i' m new here .
you' re gonna have to wait .
could you not do that , please !
where' s the manager ?
that' s a problem too , because he' s out to lunch right now .
i want to see somebody in charge .
then you' il have to wait .
excuse me .
well , excuse me !
what are you doing ?
you give those back .
oh , my god !
get out !
get out of here ! .
hi .
hi .
just came by to see what you' re doing after work .
what' s wrong ?
something weird .
what ?
nothing .
you' re sure we' re not going to be interrupted ?
quite sure .
only i ...
i like to be careful .
i can taste that .
it' s a long time since i tasted anything .
you promised me an explanation .
this is it .
let me see .
no , don' t touch it !
it' s dangerous .
it opens doors ..
what kind of doors ?
doors to the pleasures of heaven or hell .
i didn' t care which .
i thought i' d gone to the limits .
i hadn' t .
the cenobites gave me an experience beyond the limits .
pain and pleasure .
indivisible .
they won' t get me back .
i' m going to leave and you' re going to help me , yes ?
yes .
they' il never find us .
not in the whole wide world .
boom boom " has got him now !
boom boom " has got him .
i thought this kind of stuff made you sick .
i' ve seen worse .
are you all right ?
fine .
we can watch something else if you feel like ...
get him !
get him !
what was that ? .
i think i left a window open upstairs .
i' il go see .
no .
larry ,
it was nothing .
larry !
what' s the matter with you , anyway ?
it' s ... it' s just that i hate the thunder .
i' m here .
you' re safe .
you' re trembling .
there' s nothing to be afraid of .
look .
i really should check it out .
don' t go up there , please .
look , we' il both go up .
come on .
larry , please !
don' t worry about it .
come on .
don' t .
it' s okay .
it' s okay .
it' s probably a rat .
i told you .
there' s nothing to be afraid of .
let' s go downstairs .
i' il make it better ?
no , this is enough light .
come on , let' s go inside .
oh , yes .
yes , yes .
yes .
no !
no !
no , please , don' t do it , please !
i can' t bear it , please !
please , no !
please !
please , don' t !
i can' t bear it , please !
no !
look at you !
i don' t understand you !
i mean , one minute ... you' re all over me , and the next ...
i just don' t understand you .
i don' t know .
maybe we shouldn' t have come back .
i mean , brooklyn certainly wasn' t any worse than this .
look , you love her , so there must be something worth loving .
i wish it were that simple .
i got a real problem here , kiddo .
she doesn' t even want to leave the house .
really ?
it' s like she' s ... waiting for something .
what ?
i don' t know .
i don' t know .
it' s way beyond me ..
look , could you ... would you ... stop by sometime ?
try to make friends ?
sure .
who knows , maybe all she needs is somebody to talk to .
you can' t love him .
you know i don' t .
so , where' s the harm ?
i said , no !
then find me somebody else , before they come looking .
now !
i ...
i get lonely sometimes .
everybody does .
come in .
what is this ?
a game ?
jesus christ !
oh , christ !
help me !
oh , no !
get out of here !
please , don' t let him kill me .
no , please !
no !
kirsty , it' s frank , it' s uncle frank .
no !
you remember .
no !
come to daddy .
get the fuck off me !
you' ve grown .
you' re beautiful .
don' t ... don' t touch me !
don' t touch me or so help me i' il ...
i' il ...
what' il you do ?
what can you do ?
there' s nothing to be afraid of .
i bet you make your daddy so proud , don' t you ?
beautiful .
this isn' t happening .
i used to tell myself that .
used to try and pretend i was dreaming all the pain .
but don' t you kid yourself .
some things have to be endured .
and that' s what makes the pleasures so sweet .
no !
give me that !
no !
give it to me !
you want it ?
one last time , give me that box .
you want it ?
give me the box !
you wanna fucking have it ?
no ... !
kirsty .
come to daddy .
it' s frank .
you remember .
it' s uncle frank .
are you all right ?
you' re awake !
good girl .
what happened ?
i' il get the doctor .
wait a minute .
how did i get here ?
i won' t be a moment .
please , get back into bed .
i have to call my father .
that' s easily arranged , but first , back into bed .
it' s important .
it really is ...
first things first .
we' il get you a telephone after we' ve talked .
what about this ?
ring any bells ?
you were hanging on to it like grim death .
i don' t remember .
well , the police will want to speak to you .
you know that .
oh , christ !
in the meantime , maybe this will jog your memory .
shit !
the box .
you opened it .
we came .
it' s just a puzzle box !
oh , no .
it is a means to summon us .
who are you ?
explorers in the further regions of experience .
demons to some .
angels to others .
i was a mistake !
i didn' t mean to open it !
it was a mistake !
you can all go to hell !
we can' t .
not alone .
you solved the box .
we came .
now you must come with us .
taste our pleasures .
please ... go away and leave me alone !
oh , no tears , please .
it' s a waste of good suffering .
wait !
wait !
wait !
wait , please , wait !
no time for argument .
you' ve done it before , right ?
many , may times .
to a man called frank cotton ?
oh , yes .
he escaped you .
nobody escapes us .
he did .
i' ve seen him .
i' ve seen him .
impossible !
he' s alive !
supposing he had escaped us .
what has that to do with you ?
i can ...
i can lead you to him .
and you can take him back instead of me .
perhaps we prefer you .
i want to hear him confess himself , then maybe ... maybe ...
but if you cheat us .
we' il tear your soul apart .
she' il tell them everything ..
i don' t think so .
she' il want to warn larry first .
that' s probably her now .
or the police .
it doesn' t make any difference .
don' t you care ?
what i care about is a new skin .
maybe we should just leave .
like this ?
look at me .
we can' t just stay here .
my brother will be home soon .
what is it ?
i don' t know where to begin .
what are you talking about ?
it' s best you see for yourself .
i left her here safe and sound .
i even locked the door .
well , she' s not here now .
i' il start looking for her .
maybe she' s gone back to ... to her father' s house ..
daddy ?
daddy , it' s me , kirsty !
let me in !
daddy , let me in !
kirsty ?
it' s very late .
where is my dad ?
what' s the matter ?
i want to see my father !
of course .
where is he ?
where is he ? !
daddy ?
daddy ? ,
daddy , you' re all right .
sure i am .
sure i am .
you' re okay !
it' s okay .
i was so afraid that something happened to you .
i know , i know .
i need to talk to you .
yes ?
it' s okay , baby , julia told me everything .
oh , no , see ... your brother frank is upstairs .
he' s upstairs and he' s trying to kill you .
he' s trying to kill you .
no , wait , wait , wait .
whatever did frank was unspeakable .
unspeakable .
but believe me , it' s finished with now .
why is it finished ?
he' s gone .
what' s gone mean ?
he' s dead , kirsty .
he was insane , baby .
a mad dog .
had to put him out of his misery .
jesus , what a scene .
and , when i' m feeling better ,
i' il go to the police and try to make them understand .
god knows ...
i don' t really understand myself .
did he hurt you , baby ?
no , i' m okay .
he' s better off dead .
poor frank .
i don' t believe this .
i don' t believe this .
believe it .
i need to see him .
no , you don' t .
yes , i do !
yes !
show her .
we want the man who did this .
no .
no , that wasn' t the deal .
he' s my father and you can' t have him .
no !
move !
kirsty ...
move !
what' s the matter ?
there' s no time .
no way , no way , i told you all that' s over with now .
no , it' s not !
we' ve got to get out of here !
no , stay with us .
we can all be happy here .
no .
come to daddy .
oh , my god !
come ... to daddy .
ah !
frank !
well ...
so much for the cat and mouse shit !
no !
not me !
it' s nothing personal , baby .
where are you , beautiful ?
come out , come out , wherever you are .
oh , my god !
daddy .
daddy !
no , don' t mourn him .
he was dead long before we ever touched him .
bastard !
now , hush now .
everything' s all right .
frank is here .
bastard !
your dear old uncle frank .
what the hell is that ?
frank .
no !
we have to hear it from your own lips .
this isn' t for your eyes .
you set me up , bitch !
jesus wept .
not leaving us so soon , are you ?
we have such sights to show you .
oh , shit !
no !
don' t do that !
go to hell !
kirsty !
kirsty !
no .
steve !
oh , shit !
oh , kirsty !
thank god you' re okay .
let' s get the hell out of here !
