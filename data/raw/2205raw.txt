there are some things you should wish for ... and some things you shouldn' t .
that' s what my little brother frankie told me .
he told me i only had just three wishes .
and i looked in his eyes .
and i don' t know why i believed him .
remember , we' re on holiday , all right ?
knock it off , christy , love .
all those with u. s. passports , use the two left lanes .
passports , please .
we' re on holidays !
are you , little girl ?
yes .
and my dad' s not working .
what are your purposes in visiting the u. s. ?
we' re on holidays .
how long have you been in canada ?
just visiting .
listening to my mam and dad ...
we got the car in canada . ...
i was scared we weren' t gonna get across the border .
and if i didn' t talk to frankie , how were we going to get into america ?
please , frankie .
please .
please help us , " i said .
how many children do you have ?
three .
two .
two .
it says three here .
we lost one .
what' s your name , little girl ?
ariel .
and who are you ?
she' s christy .
what age are you , christy ?
she' s 10 .
welcome to america .
thanks very much .
and that was my first wish used up .
but i still had two left .
we heard manhattan before we ever saw it .
a thousand strange voices coming from everywhere .
and you' re not going to believe this ... but we had to go under the water to get to the city .
no , i swear it .
it was a real alien .
and we lost contact with everything .
it was like we were on another planet .
... classics from the ' 60s , ' 70s , ' 80s , and ' 90s ...
we looked all over manhattan for a place to live ... until finally we found the house of the man who screams .
what are you doing with the camera , little girl ?
you the police ?
what ?
fingers .
are you the police ?
no , we' re irish .
all irish are police .
we' re not .
are we going to live here now ?
you' re gonna live in here in this building ?
yeah .
all right .
keep an eye on the car .
papo' s gonna keep you safe now .
all right ?
come on in .
welcome to your new mansion .
come on .
look , a lift !
that hasn' t worked forever .
come on .
are we going to live here now ?
yeah .
why ?
nowhere else will take us .
why ?
they don' t want kids in manhattan .
why ?
why do you think it' s called " man" hattan ?
papo , don' t come any further , man .
relax , tony .
it' s just me .
i know who it is .
go back downstairs to your apartment .
i' m clean , man .
i' m showing this family the empty apartment .
no way , papo .
all right .
all right , papo .
we' il take over from here .
why does he scream ?
maybe he sees ghosts .
is this a haunted house ?
it' s like fort knox .
cool .
where did you learn that ?
what ?
" cool .
i just heard it .
you' re american already .
it' s disgusting .
race you in , christy .
it' s huge !
i know .
it' s enormous .
this is my room .
it' s big , girls .
this is my room .
i get top bunk .
look , dad .
there' s a bath in the middle of the room .
there' s pigeons !
ariel , look at this .
it' s a bit of a hole .
it' il be fine when we do it up .
it' il cost us , sarah .
how are we gonna pay for this place ?
we' il sell the car .
are you okay ?
yeah , good .
are you ?
i' m great .
are you ?
dad ?
what ?
can we keep the pigeons ?
dad , can we keep the pigeons ?
no , we have to leave them go .
it seemed like all our problems were flying away .
dad , can i help ?
go and ask your mam .
mam , can i help ?
why don' t you go on your skates ?
i' il fast forward through this bit .
ariel got to know everybody in the neighborhood .
my mam couldn' t get a job teaching .
so she got a job in the ice cream parlor so dad could go to auditions .
i really like the character .
i' m glad you asked me back .
i just wanna say i' m real pleased about that .
has he looked at the part of vinny ?
the new york guy ?
he' s a bit of a stereotype .
but if you want him , you got him .
can you do a london accent ?
you having a laugh ?
he' s only got two lines .
do you want me to come up there and sort you out ?
do you like him ?
yeah .
but acting' s about more than just accents .
i wanted to cast you .
but you' ve got to give me much more .
don' t you understand ?
get it out of your head .
it' s from here and from here .
just give me one more chance .
but he didn' t get another chance .
and then summer came .
and with it , the heat .
and a new word . ; humidity .
dad , it' s still not working .
wait .
it' s too hot .
it' s still not coming through the holes .
hang on there .

dad , don' t worry .
mam' s breathing' s okay .

we got out of there as fast as we could .
we went to the bank , took out our money ... and went to the movies where it was lovely and cool .

e. t. ' s gone to heaven .
but they said he went home .
well , that' s the same thing .
it' s not .
i miss things .
what do you miss ?
things .
i have no one to play with .
you have your sister to play with .
no .
she plays with her camcorder .
and i have no one to tell my secrets to .
christy tells them to her camcorder .
and she won' t let me hear what she says .
and you don' t play with us anymore .
i do play with youse .
not like you used to .
here you go !
step right up , pop the balloon to win a prize .
pick a number .
dad !
dad , you can win e. t. !
it' s a game of chance .
it' s as simple as pie .
just throw the ball through the hoop seven times ...
and you win e. t. seven times ?

simple as pie .
that' s $2 .
keep throwing as long as you double up your dollars .
if you win , you get the money back and any prize you like .

go for it , man !
we can' t blow all our money .
i believe in you , the kids believe in you , and you can win that doll .
go on .
you' re gonna win .
i just know it .
and then i used all my willpower to quieten the crowd .
but it didn' t work .
every cent of every penny we owned ... was down for an e. t. doll worth $30 .
so i said . ;
frankie , i have to ask you for a second wish .
and to this day , my dad still believes it was him who won the e. t. doll .
fee , fie , foe ... fum !

look at me , sarah .
are you all right ?
what' s wrong ?
come here to me .
i can' t .
come here to me .
look at me and tell me the truth .
frankie had your eyes , johnny .
say something .
you blame me .
i should have been there to catch him when he fell down the stairs .
it' s my fault .
i don' t blame you .
we had to go to a catholic school .
so my dad took a night job .
ariel was worried about a blind man called jos .
everybody smile and say " cheese .
cheese !
christy , why can jos not see ?
o say can you see
i helped , too .
fill the bag with these , like that .
yellow ones .
okay .
statue of liberty .
nation , friends , and caring .
so now we' re all together .
i' m hungry !
keep your eye on the meter .
and get in the cab and keep your ear on the radio .
i won' t be long .
and lock the doors .
401 to base .
if you can hear me , come in .
hello , base here .
where' s your dad , girls ?
he' s in his audition .
where are you ?
i' m not positive .

are you on broadway ?
yeah .
i think so .
near where ?
near the audition .
yeah .
very good .
is my baby all right ?
how are you feeling ?

a little bit tired .
but other than that , i' m okay .
mam , do you think dad will know who i am ?
youse look great .
you' il knock them out .
can you guess what they are ?
ariel' s an angel .
christy' s a forest .
she' s autumn .

you guys look great .
they look great .
irish .

i got a quarter .
you' re the best .
he gave me a quarter , angela .
he gave me a quarter .
there you go .
thank you , sir .
who are they ?
that' s the irish .
what' s wrong ?
everyone else has bought their costumes .
we look stupid .
no , you don' t .
and last but not least , a special prize this year ... for the best homemade costume goes to the sullivan sisters .
you can' t throw away your prize .
best homemade costume .
they made it up because they pity us .
you got it ' cause you' re different .
we don' t want to be .
we want to be the same as everybody else .
why would youse wanna be the same as everybody else ?
everybody else goes trick or treating .
what' s that ?
it' s what they do here for halloween .
like " help the halloween " party ?
no , not " help the halloween " party .
you don' t ask for help in america .
you demand it .
trick or treat .
you don' t ask .
you threaten .
you can' t do that on our street .
why not ?
because you can' t threaten drug addicts and transvestites , that' s why .
what are transvestites ?
a man who dresses up as a woman .
for halloween ?
no , all the time .
come on .
why ?
it' s just what they do here , okay ?
we were allowed to go trick or treating in our stupid building .
trick or treat !
dad , get out of here !
trick or treat !
come on , let' s try another door .
answer the fucking door .
why won' t they answer ?
maybe they' re afraid .
we' re nice kids , so let us in .
how many doors is that ?
four .
why am i so anxious ?
it' s the stairs , johnny .
it says " keep away .
i don' t care .
come on , christy .
trick or treat !
trick or treat .
who' s there ?
someone' s in there .
oh , my god !

what ?
hello .

yeah .

yeah .
where are you from ?
ireland .
you came all the way to america to trick or treat ?
yeah .
come in .
are there only two of you ?
two girls .
are they all right in there ?
they' il be fine .
what' s your name ?
mateo .
what' s yours ?
ariel .
hello .
my name' s christy .
hi , christy .
is that our building ?
yes , it is .
looks like a haunted house .
it is haunted .
but it' s not scary .
it' s a magic house .
frankie believed in magic .
who' s that ?
frankie .
our brother .
he died .
he fell down the stairs when he was two .
we thought he was okay .
but there was something in his brain .
a brain tumor .
and for three years it got bigger and bigger .
it was malignant .
are you crying ?
are you ?
it' s okay .
he' s in heaven now .
is that your hand ?
yes .
is that blood ?
spaghetti sauce .
come here .
i better treat you or you' il trick me , am i right ?
yeah .
okay , let' s find something .
let' s see .
so , what' s in the fridge ?
nothing .
how about this ?
how much is in it ?
a lot .
mateo' s fortune .
it' s too much .
no , it' s not .
when luck comes knocking on your door , you can' t turn it away .
happy halloween .
okay , happy halloween .
bye .
hi , dad !
we' re going to show mam what we got , okay ?
happy halloween .
happy halloween , mateo .
he was really nice , and he gave us lots of money .
how much does it add up to , christy ?
two hundred and forty pennies , twelve nickels , and two dimes .
how much is that all together ? $3 . 20 .
and he had nothing in his fridge ?
just medicine .
we should invite him over .
no way .
he gives me the heebie jeebies .
what is it ?
it' s called colcannon .
it' s potatoes mixed with curly kale .
right .
plates , please .
thank you .
wow !
that means you' re gonna be rich .
halloween is called the day of ancestors .
when the dead come back , you hear their voices .
how do you hear them ?
you hear their voices through the men dancing .
what do they say ?
they complain .
you don' t pay attention to me .
you don' t feed me .
i' m hungry .
are they ever happy ?
when they' re happy , you never hear from them .
you' re magic .
you' re winning everything .
that means you' re gonna get married .
christy !
who' s that ?
you see that ?
do you not think i' m bad , or are you just saying i' m good ' cause ...
you are .
am i doing the wings nice ?
you' re doing great .
really ?
yes .
i thought i was bad .
you' re doing great .
is that you in the pictures ?
yeah .
so you were rich ?
is that why the angel has blue blood ?
you know , in the irish language , the word for " black man " is fear gorm .
but that really means " blue man .
the word for " black man " is fear dubh .
and that means " the devil .
you have us figured out ?
they can' t wipe us out , they can' t lick us .
we' il go on forever , pa , ' cause we' re the people .
i said in mine heart , go to now ...
prove thee with mirth , therefore enjoy pleasure . " awesome .
johnny , come to bed .
it' s late , come on .
put the script down now .
you' re happy .
i am .
it' s something mateo said .
what' s he say ?
he said everything' s gonna be all right .
and the baby will bring its own luck .
the baby will bring its own luck .
that' s it there .
you see ?
i could be wrong ... but i haven' t felt the baby move for a couple of weeks .
it' s serious .
this baby will not go full term .
and if it did , it would be extremely dangerous to your health .
if you decide to go ahead with this , you' il have to be a very brave woman .
but i thought the doctor said you couldn' t have any more babies .
sometimes , ariel , doctors are wrong .
there .
it just kicked .
oh , my god !
johnny , feel it .
i remember the first time you kicked , christy .
it was in one of your dad' s plays .
every time he spoke , you kicked .
like you were applauding him .
did i ever kick ?
you kicked like a mule , night and day .
there it is again .
johnny , did you feel it ?
i can' t feel anything .
do you want me to lie ?
you' re the only actor in the world who can' t lie , johnny .
not even for the sake of your kids ?
what does that mean ?
if you can' t touch somebody you created ... how can you create somebody that' il touch anybody ?
what are you going on about ?
acting , johnny .
and bringing something to life .
it' s the same thing .
that' s why you can' t get a job acting , because you can' t feel anything .
this baby' s not frankie , sarah .
look at me .
why don' t you look at me ?
you' ve gotten over him .
i had to get over him , johnny , for the sake of the kids .
so you' re gonna put your life on the line for the sake of the kids ?
and that' s protecting them ?
yes .
that' s a total contradiction .
how ?
you know what the doctor said .
i don' t care what they said .
what do they know about us ?
and my baby ?
i gotta fucking get out of here .
where are you going ?
this is real .
no !
this is real .
it' s not a fucking play !
what are you talking about ?
where are you going ?
let me get out .
no .
you' il upset the kids !
i' il be back in a minute .
johnny , come back .
johnny , where are you going ?
johnny , you' re scaring me .
come back .
just come back .
johnny , please .
all right ?
everything all right ?
the baby will bring its own luck , will it ?
i' il tell you the luck the baby will bring .
the baby could infect her ... and two girls will be left without their ma .
so keep your trap shut .
you don' t believe .
in what ?
god ?
you know , i asked him a favor .
i asked him to take me instead of him .
and he took the both of us .
and look what he put in my place .
i' m a fucking ghost .
i don' t exist .
i can' t think .
i can' t laugh .
i can' t cry .
i can' t fucking feel !
do you wanna be me ?
do you wanna be in my place ?
i wish .
are you in love with her ?
are you in love with her ?
no .
i' m in love with you .
and i' m in love with your beautiful woman .
and i' m in love with your kids .
and i' m even in love with your unborn child .
i' m even in love with your anger !
i' m in love with anything that lives !
you' re dying .
i' m sorry .
that' s frankie .
i' m just scared .
it' s gone .
i can' t make believe anymore .
sometimes , i think our entire lives are make believe .
this is make believe .
the air i breathe is make believe .
just make believe you' re happy , johnny .
please , for the kids .
now is the winter of our discontent
made glorious summer by this sun of york
and all the clouds that there are around
dance to the lascivious pleasings of a lute
now is the winter of our discontent
made glorious summer by this sun of york
so i' m a little high ...
sometimes , it seemed like everyone in new york was an actor .
even the stockbrokers .
you might not think it to look at me ... and i know i' m white and everything , but i can rap .
help , somebody !
somebody call an ambulance !
come on , man .
somebody , help !
he' s fallen down the stairs !
i think someone' s fallen down the stairs .
i think it' s mateo .
get your coat .
it' s mateo .
will i get the lemon drops ?
yeah , and a pillow .
okay .
mateo !
did anyone call for help ?
he just fainted .
keep the dog away , man , keep him away .
go downstairs .
stevie doesn' t let me .
he' il lock me out .
that' s because you' re a junkie , papo .
go and get an ambulance .
don' t do that .
i did this to my brother .
no .
it' s different .
come on , come on .
are you okay ?
are you okay ?
can' t seem to catch my breath .
just relax .
here .
what are they ?
they' re lemon drops .
they' re magic .
if you suck on some , they' il make you better .
is that right , christy ?
yeah .
my mam takes them to help the baby .
i think you saved my life , ariel .
all right , that' s it .
get out of the fucking cab !
what are you talking about ?
i was right in the middle of a flow .
come on , what the hell is the matter with you , you freak ?
where' s the bill of rights ?
get the fuck off me , you piece of shit .
take your fucking handbag !
night , e. t.
are you awake , ariel ?
yeah .
are you , christy ?
yeah .
what' s wrong with mateo ?
some disease .
will you get it ?
what ?
mateo' s disease .
why ?
because you kissed him .
no .
night , christy .
night .
there' s dad .
get him , frankie , get him .
you okay ?
i was just out of breath .
what was frankie like ?
a warrior .
what does that mean ?
a warrior who' s not afraid to go to the other side .
the other side of what ?
this .
hi , dad .
ladies and gentlemen , we are not alone .
here on this little ball we call the earth ... we have friends among us .
don' t be scared .
he' s not too well now .
did he not take the lemon drops ?
i don' t think they agree with him anymore .
why do you have sores ?
if i tell you a secret , will you tell nobody else ?
no , i won' t .
i' m an alien .
like e. t.
from a different planet .
my skin is too sensitive for this earth .
right ?
the air is too hot for me .
are you going home like e. t. ?
i suppose i' m going home .
when are you going ?
soon .
will you say goodbye to me ?
i will .
promise ?
yes , i promise .
mam' s having a baby .
what do you think we should call it ?
we' re going to call it after you .
i think he' s asleep .
my mam had to go into hospital ... so i thought about using my third wish .
but i had to be careful .
if the baby came too soon , the baby might die .
and if the baby came too late , my mam might die .
you have to be careful what you wish for .
come on , kids , time to go .
see you later , all right ?
bye , mam .
bye .
take it easy , love .
see you tomorrow .
bye .
love you .
excuse me , mr. sullivan ?

for how much ? $5, 000 .
all right , okay .
that' s great .
thanks .
you know the situation .
you know i' m in trouble .

everyone' s dying .
will she survive it ?
she can' t survive without it .
that' s what the doctors said before they opened frankie .
what do we do ?
i' il give her the blood .
is that a decision ?
christy will give her the blood .
are you okay , little girl ?
don' t " little girl " me .
i' ve been carrying this family on my back for over a year .
ever since frankie died .
he was my brother , too .
it' s not my fault that he' s dead .
it' s not my fault that i' m still alive .
christy .
mam was always crying because he was her son .
but he was my brother , too .
i cried , too , when no one was looking .
and i talked to him every night .
she did , dad .
i talked to him every night until ...
until when ?
until i realized i was talking to myself .
listen , i' il take her home , okay ?
all right .
thanks very much .
no problem .
your check bounced .
i sat there with my dad , and all the noises of new york disappeared .
all i could hear was the blood thumping in my ear .
but for some reason , i felt happy .
i wondered if frankie had felt like this . ; special .
everybody looking at you like they were looking in a mirror .
and smiling .
except in their eyes .
did frankie know he was going to die ?
is that why he kept nodding and smiling at us ?
when he died , i cursed god .
i told him , " you' re not gonna see these snotty tears ...
running down my cheeks ever again .
so now , i can' t cry .
i thought i' d come in here ... and you' d wake up , you' d hold my hand .
i' d cry , and the kid would be all right .
everything would be okay .
we need a miracle , mateo .
hey , irish , whoa .
you can' t say hello ?
what ?
what' s up ?
i' m sorry , man .

you could say that .
yeah , the whole world had a bad day .

say goodbye to frankie , dad .
what ?
say goodbye to frankie .
bye , frankie .
he can' t hear you , dad .
goodbye , frankie .
get out of here .
dad wants you .
it was as hard for frankie to smile , when the tumor was malignant ... as it was for my dad to cry after .
but they both managed it .
i' m going to switch this off now .
it' s not the way i want to see frankie anymore .
do you still have a picture of me in your head ?
well , that' s like the picture i want to have of frankie .
one that you can keep in your head forever .
so when you go back to reality ...
i' il ask frankie ... to please , please , let me go .
