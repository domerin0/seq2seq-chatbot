look at me
i will never pass
for a perfect bride
or a perfect daughter
can it be
i' m not meant to play this part

that if i were truly to be myself
i would break my family' s heart
who is that girl i see
staring straight

the huns have invaded china .
by order of the emperor , one man from every family must serve in the lmperial army .
the hsiao family .
the yi family .
i will serve the emperor in my father' s place .
the fa family .
no !
i am ready to serve the emperor .
father , you can' t go .
mulan !

you would do well to teach your daughter to hold her tongue in a man' s presence .
mulan , you dishonor me .
report tomorrow to the wu zhong camp .
yes , sir .
the chu family !
the wen family !
the chang family !
you shouldn' t have to go !
mulan
there are plenty of young men to fight for china .
it is an honor to protect my country and my family .
so , you' il die for honor .
i will die doing what' s right .
but if you  i know my place !
it is time you learned yours .
mulan is gone !
what ?
it can' t be .
mulan !
no .
you must go after her .
she could be killed .
lf i reveal her , she will be .
ancestors , hear our prayer .
watch over mulan .
mushu , awaken .

so tell me what mortal needs my protection , great ancestor .
you just say the word and i' m there .
mushu
and let me say somethin ' .
anybody' s who' s foolish enough to threaten our family , vengeance will be mine !
mushu !
these are the family guardians .
they  protect the family .
and you , o demoted one ?

that mulan was a troublemaker from the start !
don' t look at me .
she gets it from your side of the family .
she' s just trying to help her father .
but if she' s discovered , fa zhou will be forever shamed .
dishonor will come to the family .
traditional values will disintegrate .
not to mention , they' il lose the farm .
my children never caused such trouble .
they all became acupuncturists .
well , we can' t all be acupuncturists .

your great granddaughter had to be a cross dresser !
let a guardian bring her back .
yes , awaken the most cunning .

watch this here .
aha !
jump back .
i' m pretty hot , huh ?
don' t make me have to singe nobody to prove no point .
you had your chance to protect the fa family .
your misguidance led fa deng to disaster .
yeah , thanks a lot .
and your point is ?
the point is we will be sending a real dragon to retrieve mulan .
what what i' m a real dragon !
you are not worthy of this spot .
now , awaken the great stone dragon .
so you' il get back to me on the job thing ?
just one chance , is that too much to ask ?
i mean , it' s not like it' d kill ya .
yo , rocky , wake up !

it' s going to take a miracle to get me into the army .
did i hear someone ask for a miracle ?
let me hear you say " aaah " !
aaah !
that' s close enough .
a ghost .
get ready , mulan .
your serpentine salvation is at hand !
for i have been sent by your ancestors ... to guide you through your masquerade .

eeew .
tough guy .
yao .
thank you for volunteering .
retrieve the arrow .
i' il get that arrow , pretty boy , and i' il do it with my shirt on .
one moment .
you seem to be missing something .
this represents discipline , and this represents strength .
you need both to reach the arrow .
we' ve got a long way to go .
let' s get down to business
to defeat the huns
hoo ah !  did they send me daughters
when i asked for sons
you' re the saddest bunch i ever met
but you can bet before we' re through
mister , i' il make a man
out of you
but on fire within
once you find your center
you are sure to win
you' re a spineless , pale pathetic lot
and you haven' t got a clue
somehow i' il make a man
out of you
i' m never gonna catch my breath
say good bye to those who knew me
boy , was i a fool in school for cutting gym  [ mushu ]
this guy' s got ' em scared to death  [ mulan ]
hope he doesn' t see right through me
now i really wish that i knew how to swim
be a man   with all the force of a great typhoon
be a man   with all the strength of a raging fire
mysterious as the dark side of the moon
time is racing toward us
till the huns arrive
heed my every order
and you might survive
you' re unsuited for the rage of war
so pack up , go home you' re through
how could i make a man
out of you
be a man   with all the force of a great typhoon
be a man   with all the strength of a raging fire
mysterious as the dark side  [ men cheering ]
of the moon
be a man   we must be swift as a coursing river
be a man   with all the force of a great typhoon
be a man   with all the strength of a raging fire
mysterious as the dark side  [ all grunting ]
of the moon  [ all ]
hoo ah !
what do you see ?
black pine , from the high mountains .
white horse hair .
lmperial stallions .
sulphur , from cannons .
this doll came from a village in the tung shao pass ... where the lmperial army is waiting for us .
we can avoid them easily .
no .
the quickest way to the emperor is through that pass .
and besides , the little girl will be missing her doll .
we should return it to her .
no , this is not a good idea .
what if somebody sees you ?
just because i look like a man doesn' t mean i have to smell like one .
so a couple of guys don' t rinse out their socks .
picky , picky , picky .
well , myself , i kind of like that corn chip smell .
ahhh .
okay , all right .
that' s enough .
get out before you get all pruny and stuff .
mushu , if you' re so worried , go stand watch .
yeah , yeah .
stand watch , mushu , while i blow our secret with my stupid girlie habits .
pfft !
hygiene !
me first !
me first !
we' re doomed !
there are a couple of things i know they' re bound to notice !
whooo ooo !
hey , ping !

oooh , snake !
snake !

that was vile .
you owe me big .
i never want to see a naked man again .
hey , don' t look at me .
i ain' t bitin ' no more butts .
you think your troops are ready to fight ?
ha !
they would not last a minute against the huns !
they completed their training .
those boys ... are no more fit to be soldiers than you are to be captain .
once the general reads my report , your troops will never see battle .
oh , no , you don' t !
i' ve worked too hard to get mulan into this war .
this guy' s messin ' with my plan .
we' re not finished !
be careful , captain .
the general may be your father , but i am the emperor' s counsel .
and , oh , by the way , [ scoffs ]
i got that job on my own .
you' re dismissed .
hey .
i' il hold him and you punch .
or not .
for what it' s worth , i think you' re a great captain .
i saw that .
what ?
you like him , don' t you ?
no !
yeah , all right .
yeah , sure .
go to your tent !
i think it' s time we took this war into our own hands .
let me see what you got .
from general li .
dear son , we' re waiting for huns at the pass .
it would mean a lot if you' d come and back us up .
that' s great , except you forgot , " and since we' re out of potpourri , perhaps you wouldn' t mind bringing up some .
hello !
this is the army !
make it sound more urgent !
know what i' m talkin ' about ?
that' s better .
much better .
let' s go .
khanny , baby .
hey , we need a ride .
lnsubordinate ruffians !
you men owe me a new pair of slippers !
and i do not squeal like a girl .
urgent news from the general .
what' s the matter ?
you' ve never seen a black and white before ?
who are you ?
excuse me ?
i think the question is , who are you ?
we' re in a war , man !
there' s no time for stupid questions !
i should have your hat for that .
snatch it right off your head .
but i' m feeling gracious today , so carry on before i report you .
captain , urgent news from the general !
we' re needed at the front .
pack your bags , cri kee .
we' re movin ' out .
for a long time we' ve been marching off to battle   ln our thundering herd we feel a lot like cattle  [ mooing ]

aren' t easy to ignore
hey !

a girl worth fighting for
huh ?
that' s what i said .
a girl worth fighting for
i want her paler than the moon
with eyes that shine like stars  [ yao ]
my girl will marvel at my strength
adore my battle scars
i couldn' t care less what she' il wear or what she looks like
it all depends on what she cooks like
beef , pork , chicken mmm
bet the local girls thought you were quite the charmer
and i' il bet the ladies love a man in armor  [ men ]  you can guess what we have missed the most
since we went off to war  [ wolf whistle ]
my girl will think i have no faults
that i' m a major find
uh , how ' bout a girl who' s got a brain
who always speaks her mind  [ together ]
nah !
my manly ways and turn of phrase
are sure to thrill her
he thinks he' s such a lady killer
i' ve a girl back home who' s unlike any other
yeah , the only girl who' d love him is his mother
but when we come home in victory
they' il line up at the door
what do we want   a girl worth fighting for
wish that i had   a girl worth fighting for    [ whistling ]  a girl worth fighting
