more coffee ?
yes , thanks .
any news about ... your father ?
no .
i haven' t been looking for him for a long time .
why is it suddenly so iportant ?
it isn' t .
yes , it is .
it' s important to know your roots .
what you' re doing is great .
it' s an important part of growing up .
i' ve always felt you were my dad .
you' ve been like a son , too .
he was never interested in us .
you , either .
might be fun .
i could try that tv show where they find folks .
if he' d wanted it , you would have found him .
i don' t think you' il find him .
anything exciting happening in copenhagen ?
no ...
things are pretty quiet .
we need a truck .
we need diving equipment , and we need a crow bar .
jonas will get the diving equipment .
mulle ?
you find a crow bar .
a crow bar ?
listen .
this is all pretty simple , okay ?
this is a 7 meter high reinforced concrete wall .
out here there' s water .
this is where we are
and this is the container we' re looking for .
this crane runs on these tracks .
at the end , the track rises so the crane can' t run off .
we want the track to stay down .
there' s a gear wheel underneath that raises the track .
we can block it with a crow bar .
then the crane will run off the track , through the wall , and out to us .
we drive in and fetch this .
they' re in here somewhere ...
don' t you have your own computer ?
why ?
do you need it ?
what are you doing ?
i' m trying to find my real father .
exciting .
just like that tv show .
have you heard about my aunt ?
my aunt' s new husband sent her to a genealogist .
this genealogist really began studying her family tree .
it turns out that both she and her grandmother were adopted .
isn' t that strange ?
it sure is .
what' s most amazing is that she' s distantly related to the genealogist .
didn' t you want to use it ?
yes ...
someone called you from waterloo .
from waterloo ?
the strip bar .
i know what waterloo is .
katchuska " ... ?
i don' t know anyone there .
she' s called five or six ...
i said i don' t know anyone there !
it all sounds fine .
the gear wheel' s the only problem .
it' s underwater .
can any of you dive ?
i' ve held my head under for 90 seconds .
are you going diving ?
no , we' re not .
what about you , mulle ?
i don' t think so .
i' m supposed to find a crow bar .
okay ... a crow bar .
what' s that ?
something anders is showing us .
don' t put a plastic bag over your head , okay ?
but you' re not going diving , right ?
this shit' s heavy ...
what' s going on here ?
hi .
come here , mulle .
hi , boys .
hi , jens .

you can' t be serious .

what' s that ?
it' s anders ' .
anders ' salt ?
hi , jens .
hi , louise .
are you staying to eat ?
no , thanks .
you' re sure they haven' t smelled a rat down on langeland ?
no .
that' s good , my boy .
you' re sure you don' t need anything ?
i need $4, 000 .
you' ve got to be joking .
it' s true .
you cost me too much .
we have to do it my way . $4, 000 is nothing to them .
it' s going to cost a lot more when i' m finished with them .
what can i say ?
what you like .
you can assign me to another case .
i' il need receipts .
of course .
when will they be arrested ?
i don' t know .
when i' m ready .
do you need back up ?
no , thanks .
someone called for you from waterloo .
what ?
a girl .
what' s that about ?
i sure don' t know .
she wanted to speak with you .
that' s a drag , because i don' t know anyone at waterloo .
it must have been a mistake .
12 1 .
14 1 .
we play to twenty points .
twenty , i said .
come on , thomas .
just relax .
jesus , jens .
i can' t drive a truck .
i can' t either .
it' s like a car .
you just sit higher up .
no .
there' s 24 gears .
you drive and i do the diving .
you can' t dive .
i want to dive .
no , you don' t .
i want to dive , too .
okay , i' il drive .
i' il dive and you drive the truck .

yeah , you drive .
thomas ?
what are you guys up to ?
what do you mean ?
going diving ?
i wouldn' t mind trying .
come on .
what' s going on ?
what do you mean ?
just relax .
what about louise ?
would you like to be in prison when she gives birth ?
you want to be a dad who' s in prison ?
take it easy .
like all those idiots in prison while their kid are being born ?
of course not .
then don' t get involved in that shit .
what' s your problem ?
what' re you guys doing this evening ?
we' re going to a birthday party .
in a truck ?
no .
it' s thomas ' mother' s birthday .
is it her birthday ?
want to chip in ?
an oriental carpet . $80 . $80 ?
oriental .
it' s huge .
it must be , if you need a truck .
thomas , come here .
buy her something nice .
no more of that carpet bullshit .
don' t go making trouble this evening .
okay .
here .
turn !
there' s no street there ...
hold on !
that' s the way .
is it here ?
behind the wall .
we could drive the truck right through .
i' m getting out .
you can' t .
it' s reinforced concrete .
just use more speed .
you couldn' t get a bulldozer through .
how about anders ' plan ?
what about me ?
start by being quiet .
if the crane drives off the track , it' il break through the wall right there .
come on , let' s do it .
shouldn' t we move the truck ?
welcome , jens .
and welcome to your foster parents , bitten and hans .
it was you , hans , who took the initiative .
jens was adopted when he was three months old
and his mother died many years ago .
you' ve never met your real father .
no .
but you' d like to find him .
yes .
take a look at this ...
we' re in buenos aires , on the trail of frederico casarroz , jens ' father .
it' s very war here ...
we had to go to buenos aires to find clues about your father .
it may look like it was easy , but jette ran into some problems .
it' s no wonder we couldn' t find jens ' father , frederico casarroz
because he doesn' t exist .
but there' s a frederico casatores who lives up in the ountains .
we' re headed up there now .
we' re finally here .
it' s been really hard to find , but ...
put it in your mouth and breathe .
is any air coming in ?
it tastes awful .
put out that cigarette .
no .
why ?
i' m supposed to breathe your cigarette smoke down there ?
you get air from the oxygen flask .
hop in .
do you have the crow bar ?
nope .
you don' t ?
why not ?
it' s not hard enough .
look at this .
here .
what the hell is that ?
where' s the crow bar ?
it' s not strong enough .
this is much better .
know what a crow bar' s for ?
this is an arm .
a crow bar' s really strong .
no , it bends .
this is cast iron .
it' s bronze .
oh ... ?
then it' s even stronger .
shouldn' t we get going ?
fine .
just jump in .
it' s high quality metal .
it' s some old junk .
you should jump in .
no way .
just go ahead .
give thomas the arm .
just jump .
don' t go down with flippers on .
have you ever seen jacques cousteau ?
i said he should jump .
how much are we getting for this ?
why , mulle ?
no special reason .
do you know ?
need money ?
no , no , no .
no .
i was just wondering ...
how did you figure out that it won' t fall over ?
was that the plan ?
drive .
christ , anders .
i think we better get going .
there' s your hole .
it blocked on the wheel .
we didn' t know there was a container behind the wall .
what now ?
which container , thomas ?
that one over there !
a crow bar wouldn' t have worked .
there' s just a number .
no packing list .
put those numbers on again !
don' t switch them !
which one do we want ?
put them back !
i can' t remember where they were .
put them on !
my god , is it big !

what' s the problem ?
container theft .
they mentioned " material " , so we called you .

jens the cop " ?
he can' t remember a thing .
he has no idea who he is .
what happened out there ?
come here .
has anyone spoken to his girlfriend ?
louise doesn' t know he' s here ?

won' t he get well ?
maybe .
no one can say .

what do you mean ?
if i' m going to save your ass
tell me where the container is and who you' re dealing with .
where is it ?
it' s in the fridge .
don' t drink all of it .
only thomas knows where the container is .
what about you , anders ?
only thomas knows .
mulle ?
pardon me ?
i had nothing to do with it .
i just had to find an arm .
an arm ?
no , a crow bar .
yes , but ...
it doesn' t matter .
the container belongs to the chinese .
that was really dumb .
really dumb , grandpa .
fuck , man .

it was a load of ghetto blasters .
we took the wrong container .
it was full of cloth .
cloth .
you mean silk ?
could be .
who were the ghetto blasters for ?

i should tell manfred we need to talk about you .
shit happens to all of us .

never let your private life get in the way of your job .
you' re chasing some gunman , thinking of your mom
and bang , you' re finished .

that' s the other server .
then you can find your father , and ...

the russians ?
the mafia needs a good network .
eastern europe doesn' t have one here yet .
yes , they do ...
no .
who has the biggest network right now ?
the yugos .
it' s been the yugos since the 60' s .

who , then ?
the germans .
the germans ?
you' re kidding .
there aren' t so many .
you' re talking about drugs ?
isn' t that our department ?

what do you think ?
ninety million people live there .
eighty .
there are 80 million in germany .
finished interrupting ?
which land borders germany ?
holland .
or belgium .
france .
cut the crap .
it' s denmark !
and what else ?
we' ve just said .
all of eastern europe .
who wants to get into the scandinavian dope market ?
eastern europe .
russia .
the germans would never ignore a market like that .
right now , germans control the market .
is that right ?
over 200, 000 germans live in denmark .
26 % of danish summer houses are german owned .
they' re situated along the coast .
a perfect distribution network .
you' re right , manfred .
we' ve got to bust the russians .
but we get to them through the germans .
good work , jens .
thanks .

the deal' s going down at this summer house on funen .
funen ?

300, 000 ?
yes .
they' re going to sell me 2 . 5 kilos of heroin .
it costs $300, 000 .
i need the money now .
are you sure ?
completely .
this is the biggest sting we' ve ever made .
we' ve got to get busy .
the deal goes down at 1 : 30 pm .
that means ...
i' ve got to be on the train in thirty minutes .
good , jens .
what do we do now ?
how many men can we mobilize ?
maybe forty .
about forty .
40 ?
with none left in copenhagen ?
just at the airport .
fine .
do it .
when do you need the money ?
now .
i' il go down first on the train .
can you get it in time ?
i' il have to go to the brass .
can you get it ?
get yourself a microphone .
that' s a lousy idea .
do as i say .
i don' t want anything happening to you .
close the door .
i want you to keep an eye on him .
if something happens , call hs immediately .
i' il take a sight scanner with me .
it' s okay .
we' il take good care of him .

i' ve coded in all the maps .
then i can find locations on this one .
aarhusgade .
aarhusgade ?
that' s in copenhagen .
randersgade .
copenhagen as well .
in jutland !
why ?
i don' t care about the streets in jutland .
you don' t have to show me .

what' s that ?
let it ring .
no .
if it' s thomas ...
he' il leave a message .

i want to talk to louise .
she' s standing here screaming .
i don' t have time to talk .

shut up and let me talk to her .
what ... ?
fuck you .
what a cunt .
you said you hadn' t taken any of that silk .
right .
come on .
there' s something wrong .
come on , sune .
the car' s not locked .
no one breaks into a police car .
but it' s an undercover car .
i' il track his mike with this one .
manfred here .
everything okay ?
hello ?
do you read e ?
where the hell are you ?
we' re really in trouble with manfred .
no we' re not .
we' il find him ourselves .
we' il track his cell phone .
