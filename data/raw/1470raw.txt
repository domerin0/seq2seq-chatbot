she was broke ... and asked me to lend her money
i felt sorry for her ...
so you lent her money
and then slept with her ?
just once
she felt terrible and asked me to drink with her
i regretted it so much
i told her i have a girlfriend
and i never saw her again
do you know about this ?
if i tell you i went to the hotel just to see her ...
would you think i' m stupid ?
i know they' re way above me
i know i have no right to fight for him
he said he has a girlfriend already
but i still force myself to compare with her
but ...
i really wanted to see what she looks like
when i saw her ...
i realized she' s nothing special
thanks
ching ...
i' m sorry

kidney theft
it was at ten last night
a woman was hanging out in a bar
her drink was doped
when she was being anestheticized ...
wai she woke up .
a neighbor heard and called the police
when the police arrived ... the suspect was gone
suen ling who was interrogated earlier ... is confirmed innocent
scrambled eggs with ham
fried eggs with ham
madam , the coffee ...

i said no salt in my egg
sorry madam .
i' il change it for you
why apologize ?
why does everyone say sorry ?

just say sorry and everything will be fine
eating salt can kill me .
what would happen then ?
get her a new dish
yes
sorry
hello ?
hello ?
do you know everyone is watching you ?

your mom was embarrassed
it' s no use .
the newsstands have tons of them
right .
you' re so sure i' m the suspect
when shall i come to take your kidney ?
she called you ... and said since you' re so sure she' s the suspect ... when should she come to take your kidney ?
yes
i' m sure it' s her
do you drink in the morning ?
as drunk as during that wedding last time ?
no !
i seldom drink
it' s just a routine question
no drinking problem
she knew your every move at the restaurant
and followed you , right ?
yes
done
we' il take care of the case
you don' t trust me ?
you think i' m lying
since she had an affair with wai you think i' m setting her up ?
why not check what she' s doing at the time ?
will you only take action after my kidney is gone ?
miss , first ... it' s our decision whether there' il be an investigation
second , we' ve ... only slept for a few hours each day for months
it' s all because of this case
our time is precious
third ...
i believe this is a love dispute
even if she did call to threaten you we' ve done what we can
if she calls to harass you again
you can apply for an interdict
i suggest the three of you should have a talk
there .

the granny in the hospital wanted to tell you
you sat there suddenly and scared her
she kept having nightmares afterwards
she thought she saw a ghost
my kidney is worthless
i have renal failure
you don' t even have the courage to open your eyes ?
why me ?
i don' t like you
i enjoy watching the fear on your face
yes .
i made those threatening calls
i' ve never seen such a pathetic woman
if i knew , i wouldn' t have followed you
and even fought off the guy for you
your hand
no one can take your kidney ... but me
call the police
you always want the police to get me , right ?
you hate me so much
why save me ?
i don' t know .
no time to think about it yet
but it doesn' t mean i don' t hate you
i hate you so much
why ?
i' m jealous
you won' t understand
you' il never understand
because you are not me
call the police
you really don' t want to call the police ?
she' il be in trouble if we go to the police

no , i don' t
you have enough money ... for a kidney transplant
i tried once
but in the operation theatre , the surgeon realized that the donated kidney was dead
it' s very difficult to find a kidney for me
my blood type is ab negative
i remember ... it was a lovely day
when hope is in front of you ... and it suddenly vanishes ... it' s much worse than having no hope
i' m ab negative too
hope is better than no hope
put the flowers in the room
put them here
i' m getting the room ready for my mom
your mom is coming home ?
my mom will never wake up again
she will be more comfortable at home as long as i have the money for the equipment
how much ?
you want to pay for me ?
i won' t accept it
you still don' t understand ?
the difference between us is ... whatever i want , i must achieve it myself
why is it that everything i say is wrong ?

massage
massage

that' s stupid
learn how to release yourself
you' il be much happier

no ...
actually , everyone' s subconscious is buried in this universe
when gathered together , it' s like one enormous databank
if we find the right key we can locate the data we need
let' s try it
please sit down
first ... relax your body and ease your concentration
then focus your concentration ... on your hands your partner' s hands ... and also your partner' s eyes
now , relax ... and concentrate
relax ...
relax
you now start to forget who you are
when your senses become hyper sensitive you can feel your partner' s energy wall
let your subconscious ... ... move into your partner' s subconscious
then ... you can sense your partner' s ... every sensation
i can feel your happiness
many people love you
but you' re not satisfied
i can feel your loneliness ... deeply lonely
you hate your sickness .
you feel inferior
and insecure
money means a lot to you
you have a big wardrobe at home
lots of beautiful clothes and shoes
and cosmetics too
you need to hide yourself behind these things
you are used to fighting ... for what you want
i see the sunset
there is a little girl
she is you
you' re on a swing with a boy
he says ... we will be good friends till we die
friends forever
if you have any difficulty , you must tell me

it felt so real .
let' s try again
next time
this is for you .

it' s so pretty
did your friend come back for you ?
why are you asking ?
just curious
he' s not wai .
don' t worry
don' t get me wrong
i' m not sure ...
in fact ...
i can' t tell if i' d thought about whether he is wai
it' s embarrassing to talk about it
but we were speaking from our hearts
i mean my conversation with my childhood friend
i don' t have many friends you must tell me
i' il always be there for you
please don' t make fun of my memory
in fact i envy you
my health is poor
i don' t have many friends

kidney thief slaughtered himself
the anecdote of kwok ping keung
here are all the school directories from the 80s
you can' t photocopy them
please read them here
thanks
kwok ping keung
suen ling
ming , is ching there ?
wai , she' s not well
how is she ?
she needs dialysis now
tell him to leave .
i don' t want to see him
i won' t go
let them talk
ching
listen to me
ling is not as simple as we thought
she and the thief were classmates
i saw their photo ... in their school directory
why should i believe you ?
you don' t have to but it' s a fact
even you can have two faces
one for me and one for another woman
i don' t care what the fact is
i just don' t want to see you again
i' ve never cooked before
you are wonderful
smells so good !
it' s all set
don' t forget your keys next time
thanks !
time for the pills
i' m thinking ... if i could live like this , how lovely it' d be
my mom likes you a lot
you can be my sister
it was possible before .
not anymore
why ?
because keung died of you
i' m the one behind the thefts
keung was that friend
we lost contact after primary school
half a year ago , he went bankrupt ... and was deeply in debt
then he remembered me
keung
i don' t have the money to help
but having a friend to listen ... was better than being alone
as we talked the kidney idea came up
he took care of the targets
i removed the kidneys
i needed money to bring mom home
i' m sorry
we kept our promise to help each other
we split the money from the kidneys
the police couldn' t figure it out
we were two seemingly unrelated people
we didn' t take your kidney that night
because we think you' re a potential buyer
are you sure ?
yes
we really wanted to help you
i really see you as a friend
do you want a normal life ?
what ?
why did you do that to keung ?
you betrayed me
i didn' t
because i enjoy watching the fear on your face
even if you betrayed me ...
i wouldn' t be angry with you
i' d take it
i' il go to jail with you
what about your mom then ?
if someone has to be blamed ...
let me be the one
but i' m not going to jail
bye
no
no
don' t you know ... only he would take care of me forever
he' s gone now
so is my mom
all my loved ones are gone
life becomes meaningless
but there' s one thing i haven' t done yet
to take your kidney
do you feel tired ?
want to sleep ?
it' s the pills
you must suffer like keung did
it' s here ...
cut a 9 inch opening
pull open the flesh
dig out the kidney
but not today
because i enjoy watching the fear on your face
have a nice sleep .
i' il come back tonight
how did you come in ?
why do you have ching' s medical reports ?
we are friends .
i care for her
what about this ?
if you didn' t mention your school before no one would ever have guessed
he' s the kidney thief
many people were hurt
ching almost died
why did you cover for him ?
ching .
she is all you care
all my efforts in bed made no difference ?
you always knew our rule of the game
i never cheated you
i gave you money
why can' t i compare to her ?
at least i can take off my clothes in front of you
and that' s where she can' t compare to you
you are cheap !
i move a finger and you' il jump me
she has class !
ching is the only woman i really love
i can' t afford to lose her
i knew i don' t stand a chance from the beginning
but i didn' t know that ...
when you say it it' il hurt so much
that' s it .
we should stop
you want to study medicine .
i' il support you
please give me a chance
don' t move a finger
or i' il jump you
do you want it or not ?
why can' t you give us all a chance ?
i have no chance
do you know ... you' re also the only man i really love ?
wai
wai
is it you , wai ?
guess what wai and i are doing now ?
give me your kidney and i' il give you wai
what did you do to him ?
you can call the police
but then you' il never see him again
wai !
where are you going ?
wai ...
wait for me
wai ...
i' m here
wai ...
miss !
come back
where' s wai ?
where' s he ?
you' re finally angry
come , kill me ...
kill me !
if you kill me , you' il never see wai again
give wai back to me !
vc
we found a kidney at the scene
you were in critical condition
we had an operation on you immediately
we found out the kidney belonged to the dead at the scene
so far , your body is not rejecting the kidney
this is a rare case
what are you saying ?
what kidney ?
who died ?
take the kidney out ...
i don' t want it
take it out
i don' t want it !
calm down
nurse , give her a sedative
take it out , i don' t want it ...
no ...
calm down ...
i don' t want it ...
i don' t have many friends
then let' s always be together
always
you' il owe me this for the rest of your life
