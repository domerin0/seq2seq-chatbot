excuse me , mr. filby !
i say , it' s outright rude of him !
he' s merely been detained .
this is such a lost of time !
lf he' s not coming , i have more important things to do .
well , speak up .
what is it , woman ?
well , are we or are we not invited for dinner ?
apparently we are .
how long has he been gone ?
i' m not certain , sir .
several days .
i' ve hardly seen him for some time .
he never leaves the lab .
he only comes in and picks at his food .
but he did tell me about dinner , and left those instructions .
thank you , mrs. watchett .
what' s it say , filby ?
what' s wrong ?
nothing , really .
george says that if he' s not here by 8 , we' re to begin without him .
walter , what time is it ?
dinner is served , gentlemen .
first sensible thing i' ve heard all evening .
this is peculiar .
he' s usually prompt , precise and punctual .
he' s making fools of us by not showing up .
it' s ungentlemanly .
to say nothing of a waste of time .
yes .
a waste of time .
one thing i like about george : best cellar in england .
and mrs. watchett is the finest cook in the world .
yes , i think i' il drink to that .
good lord !
what' s happened ?
i' m all right .
some food .
a drink .
i didn' t recognize you .
mrs. watchett .
can' t you speak ?
what happened to you ?
leave him alone .
it' s fine .
i' ve got to tell it while i remember .
relax .
try to relax .
you' ve all the time in the world .
you' re right , david .
that' s exactly what i have .
all the time in the world .
since we were together five days ago . . . . . . the last day of 1 899 .
there in that box rests the result of two years ' labor .
i wanted to finish the job before the new century began .
i barely made it .
cheers , gentlemen .
marvelous , old boy .
yes , but what is it ?
well , it has to do with time .
i' ve always maintained that this nation . . . . . . needs a reliable timepiece .
the navy needs one .
the army needs one for the artillery .
you couldn' t do better , george .
that' s why you' ve been in hiding ?
very clever of you , indeed .
i don' t think george is referring to a new timepiece .
no , david .
when i speak of time , i' m referring to the fourth dimension .
go on , george .
the fourth dimension cannot be seen or felt .
lf you don' t mind , will you refresh me on the first three dimensions ?
really , filby .
surely they taught you something in school .
suppose you explain it , doctor .
certainly .
for example , when i move in a line , forward or backward . . . . . . that' s one dimension .
when i move left or right , two dimensions .
when i move up or down . . . . . . three dimensions .
for instance , that box .
length , breadth and height .
what is the fourth dimension ?
that' s mere theory .
no one knows if the fourth dimension exists .
on the contrary .
the fourth dimension is as real and true as the other three .
ln fact , they couldn' t exist without it .
what do you mean ?
let' s take that box .
it has the first three dimensions .
what' s inside ?
i' m coming to that .
let' s consider this first .
why do we ignore the fourth dimension ?
because we can' t move within it .
up , down , forward , sideways , backward .
but when it comes to time , we are prisoners .
do you follow me , bridey ?
no .
you' ve given a lucid explanation but i' m afraid i don' t understand .
there are many things you don' t understand , yes ?
quite a number .
yet you don' t refuse to believe in them ?
not if i can see the proof myself .
good , walter .
gentlemen , all i' m asking you . . . . . . is to witness a demonstration of movement . . . . . . within the fourth dimension .
doctor , can i have your help ?
certainly .
it' s beautiful !
remarkable .
very nice , george .
fascinating .
what is it ?
this is only an experimental model .
to carry a man , i need a larger one .
to carry a man ?
where ?
lnto the past or into the future .
this is a time machine .
you' ve had your joke .
tell us what this contraption is for .
i' ve already told you .
the larger model can carry a passenger through time .
not through space , but through time .
lf you go to the future , won' t you mess things up for us ?
the future' s already there .
it cannot be changed .
i wonder .
that' s the most important question i hope to answer .
can man control his destiny ?
can he change the shape of things to come ?
lf you' ve gone mad , i forgive you .
but if you' re wasting our time  no !
you' re here as witnesses .
to see , not to listen .
to see ?
what ?
the experiment i' m about to perform .
let me tell you how it works .
the time traveler sits in the saddle .
ln front are the controls .
let' s do this properly .
you can spare a cigar , i trust ?
let us imagine that this cigar . . .
. . . is the time traveler .
the lever in front of him controls movement .
forward pressure sends it into the future . . . . . . backward pressure , into the past .
the harder the pressure , the faster it travels .
our little experiment can be performed only once .
lf it succeeds , i lose my model .
that' s why i need witnesses .
go ahead , george .
ready , gentlemen ?
lend me your hand , please .
i' il be damned !
it worked .
where did it go ?
go ?
nowhere , in the usual sense .
it' s still here .
but it' s no longer in the present .
it' s traveling through time .
to the future , to be exact .
you expect us to believe that ?
certainly .
you said it hadn' t really moved .
that' s correct .
then why can' t we see it ?
because we' re in this room on december 31 , 1 899 . . . . . . but the model is perhaps a hundred years away by now .
this house may not be here in 1 00 years .
but the time machine occupies the same space . . . . . . as before its journey .
lf it' s occupying the same space , why can' t i feel it ?
the space you' re putting your hand through is today' s space .
you can' t put your hand into tomorrow' s space .
space doesn' t change !
the same space that' s here now should be here forever .
no , philip , time changes space !
this flat ground could' ve been at the bottom of the sea long ago .
a million years from now , it could be the interior of a huge mountain .
lf all this is true , what do you expect to do with such a contraption ?
contraption ?
i intend taking a journey into the future .
or perhaps the doctor would volunteer to go ?
well , look here , george . . . . . . suppose you do go off to the 50th century . . . . . . how will you get back ?
that' s a risk i' m ready to take .
now , look here , george .
i don' t know what you think , but we' re not fools !
we' re practical businessmen .
even if you had invented a time machine , what of it ?
what' s its use ?
who' d buy it ?
how much would it cost ?
have you thought of the commercial possibilities ?
no , i haven' t .
george . . . !
there' s a war on in south africa .
the boers are putting up a fight .
the country needs inventors like you .
i can put you in touch with the war office .
what do you think , david ?
dr. hillyer has a good point , george .
that' s more sensible .
i' il see to it right away .
good lord !
it' s time to go .
yes , i' m sure we all have plans for tonight .
are you all right , george ?
yes , i' m all right .
coming , bridewell ?
thanks for coming .
good night .
happy new year .
happy new century , george .
good night .
happy new year !
i thought i' d better stay .
you shouldn' t trouble yourself .
i' m all right .
no , you' re not .
you' ve been behaving oddly for over a month .
i' il leave , once you tell me what' s on your mind .
i appreciate the gesture .
i just want to be left alone .
you' ve changed , george .
enormously .
i' m sorry .
will you answer me one question , honestly ?
yes , i' il try .
why this preoccupation with time ?
why not ?
don' t go simple on me .
the truth is , i don' t much care for the time i was born into .
people aren' t dying fast enough .
they call upon science . . . . . . to invent new , more efficient weapons to depopulate the earth .
and i agree with you .
i agree , but here we are and we have to make the best of it .
you may have to .
i don' t .
all right .
take your journey on your contraption .
what would you become ?
a greek ?
a roman ?
a pharaoh ?
i prefer the future .
you' re not seriously saying you can do it ?
you saw the experiment , didn' t you ?
i saw a toy machine vanish .
i' m sure there are any number of ways of doing that trick .
any magician could probably do it .
it wasn' t a trick !
want to see the full scale model ?
no , i don' t .
i have no desire to tempt the laws of providence .
and i don' t think you should .
it' s not for man to trifle with .
you carry on like hillyer and kemp .
there' s something to say about their common sense attitude .
i speak to you as a friend .
more .
as a brother .
lf that machine can do what you say it can , destroy it .
destroy it before it destroys you !
you must have plans for new year' s eve .
don' t let me keep you .
mary wasn' t well .
we thought we' d stay home with the baby .
why not come home with me ?
you haven' t seen jamey for a while .
i' m sorry , i can' t .
what' s stopping you ?
i just want to see the old century out by myself , that' s all .
have it your way , george .
will you promise you' il not go out of the house tonight ?
i promise i won' t walk out the door .
i' m sorry .
please don' t think me unkind or unfriendly .
come over to dinner friday .
very well .
fine .
bring the others with you .
as you say , george .
happy new year .
happy new year , david .
having supper in tonight , sir ?
i don' t think so .
why don' t you go and celebrate ?
thanks , but if you don' t need me , i' il turn in earlier , if i can .
good night , sir .
good night .
mrs. watchett , i invited mr. filby and the others to dinner friday .
happy new year , mrs. watchett .
at first , i pushed the lever forward very slightly ... ... and the laboratory grew faint around me .
i stopped .
no change .
everything exactly as before .
no !
the clock said 6 : 31 when i started , and now it was ... 8 : 09 ?
and the candle , shorter by inches .
yet by my watch , which was with me , only a few seconds had passed .
it was disconcerting to see the sun arc in less than a minute .
to see a snail race by .
flowers flinging wide their petals to embrace the day .
the hours speeding across my sundial .
flowers closing their eyes for the night .
it was wonderful !
changes that normally took hours took seconds .
dear mrs. watchett ... ... always able to suggest a tie ... ... but never wearing anything more stylish ... ... than what she' s worn for years .
yet i was traveling very slowly .
what if i went faster ?
it became intoxicating .
i pushed the lever on toward even greater speed .
i gained experience with it .
i could stop for a day , an hour , or even a second to observe .
then go ahead a year or two .
i was able to see the changing world in a series of glimpses .
good heavens .
that' s a dress ?
this was intriguing .
i wonderedjust how far women would permit this to go .
i began to grow very fond of that mannequin .
maybe because , like me , she didn ' t age .
thirteen years passed .
fourteen , fifteen , sixteen ....
suddenly the light was gone .
what had happened ?
in the year 1917 , i stopped .
filby !
are you going to a masquerade party ?
you look rather silly without your mustache .
were you addressing me , sir ?
it' s george !
i expected a more enthusiastic greeting
you' re confusing me with my father .
there was quite a resemblance .
i' m james filby .
was " ?
were you a friend of father' s ?
yes .
yes , i' ve been away .
he was killed in the war .
a year ago .
i' m so sorry .
and the gentleman across the street ?
oh , the inventor chap ?
he disappeared around the turn of the century .
lf you' re interested in that house , you can' t buy it .
you can' t even get inside .
why ?
my father was executor of the estate and refused to liquidate it .
i often chided him on that . . . . . . but he believed the owner would return some day .
people hereabouts think it' s haunted , but . . . .
who are you , sir ?
just a stranger who once knew your father .
have you been at the front ?
front ?
what front ?
the war , of course .
what war ?
good heavens !
you don' t know we' ve been at war with germany since 1 91 4 ?
i thought you' d just returned from france .
or perhaps . . . .
perhaps some tea might make you feel better .
won' t you come in ?
no , thank you .
are you sure you' re all right ?
yes , i' m quite all right .
then goodbye , sir .
goodbye , jamey .
in 1940 , i began to be buffeted from side to side .
i first thought the machine had a mechanical defect .
the last time i had stopped was in 1917 , 23 years ago .
the war was still waging .
now in the air with flying machines .
then i realized the truth .
this was a new war .
i decided to push into time and see the outcome of this .
my house was hit !
the flames shot up .
instantly , my home was gone .
i was in the open air .
the years rolled by , everything unfamiliar .
except the smile of my never aging friend .
what was this ?
weird sounds all around .
what could it be ?
my curiosity compelled me to stop .
at first i wondered if i was the cause of the panic .
i was soon to find out i wasn ' t .
keep it moving !
shove it on !
come on , into the shelter .
come on , young man !
come on !
filby ?
the name is mr. filby .
didn' t you hear the siren ?
the horrible screeching ?
it wasn' t constructed for aesthetic value . . . . . . but to warn young fools to get into shelter .
now , come along .
i' m perfectly comfortable here .
i' ve got to talk .
this is fantastic !
your store is magnificent !
the achievements !
the gigantic strides man has taken !
come along , young man !
the mushrooms will be sprouting !
mushrooms ?
you look familiar .
haven' t we met somewhere before ?
lndeed we have , mr. filby .
right there .
many years ago .
i was sure of that .
but the exact time escapes me .
it was two wars ago .
1 91 7 .
now i recall .
the chap who inquired about my father . . . . . . and the house that used to stand across the way .
but no . . . .
no , that' s impossible !
you haven' t changed .
you' re not a day older .
and your clothes !
don' t worry , filby .
it' il take time to explain , but
that' s the last alert !
hurry !
hurry !
listen , this is important .
look !
an atomic satellite , zeroing in .
that' s important .
but i' ve got to talk to you !
come on !
hurry !
hide till the all clear !
but , filby , i' ve got to talk to you !
the labor of centuries , gone in an instant .
mother earth , aroused by man ' s violence ... ... responded with volcanic violence of her own .
only my speed through time saved me from being encased in stone .
the molten rock cooled .
i prayed ... ... wondering how many eons must pass ... ... before the wind and rain could wear away the mountain .
darkness .
darkness for centuries .
i wondered if there was still a war being waged above me ... ... if man would still exist when i saw the sun again .
the centuries rolled by .
i put my trust in time ... ... and waited for the rock to wear down .
i was free again !
thousands of centuries passed but the earth stayed green .
there was no winter , no wars .
had man learned to control both the elements and himself ?
i had to stop and find out .
but i' d stopped too fast .
magnificent !
beautiful flowers everywhere !
natural splendor beyond compare .
the whole landscape a garden without any weeds or briars .
trees and vines laden with fruit of strange shapes and colors .
nature tamed completely ... ... and more bountiful than ever !
at last i' d found a paradise .
but it would be no paradise if it was mine alone .
unrepaired for centuries .
maybe unlived in for as long .
anybody here ?
so this is man ' s future : to bask in the sun , bathe in the streams ... ... and eat the fruits of the earth , work and hardship forgotten .
well , and why not ?
don' t just sit there !
help her !
are you all right ?
thank you .
why did you ?
why did i what ?
come after me .
sit down .
i did it to save your life .
that doesn' t seem to mean much to you , or anybody else .
it doesn' t .
twenty of your friends were watching you drown .
not one lifted a finger to save you .
that' s a very curious attitude .
a very curious world .
aren' t you interested in who i am ?
where i come from ?
should i be ?
take me to somebody a little older .
somebody i can talk to .
there is no one older .
do you mean nobody ages in this land of yours ?
what' s your name ?
weena .
how do you spell it ?
spell ?
spell , write .
can' t you write ?
look .
what are your people called ?
eloi .
come .
we must go now .
what' s wrong ?
it' s getting dark .
i don' t mind telling you , i' m quite hungry .
i' ve come a long , long way .
ln my time , a berry that size . . . . . . would' ve been big news all over the world .
excuse me , sir .
sir ?
perhaps curiosity has died .
perhaps . . . . . . courtesy too , but i' ve come far and i' d like to know things .
why ?
because i shall return to my time , and my people will ask questions .
what kind of government rules your world ?
we have no government .
well , you must have a body of men who pass and enforce laws .
laws ?
there are no laws .
where do you get food and clothing ?
doesn' t anybody work ?
no .
where does that come from ?
it grows .
it always grows .
i know , but it must be . . . . . . cultivated and planted and nurtured . . . .
well , unless you . . . .
you have an economy so well developed that you can spend all your time . . . . . . studying and experimenting ?
ls that right ?
you ask many questions .
that is the only way man has learned and developed .
i wish to learn .
i want to learn about your civilization .
do you have books ?
books ?
yes , we have books .
wonderful !
i can learn about you from books .
they' il tell me what i want to know .
could i see the books ?
yes , they do tell me all about you .
what have you done ?
thousands of years of building , rebuilding , creating and re creating . . . . . . so you can let it crumble to dust !
a million years of sensitive men dying for their dreams .
for what ? !
so you can swim and dance . . .
. . . and play !
you !
all of you !
i' m going back !
i won' t bother to tell of the useless struggle . . . . . . the hopeless future .
but at least i' il die among men !
weena , what are you doing ?
i came to warn you .
how do you open that panel ?
no one can .
only the morlocks .
who are the morlocks ?
they give us our food and clothes .
we must obey .
why' d they take my machine ?
you' ve got to tell me !
we mustn' t be out in the dark .
only children are frightened by the dark .
you are a child , aren' t you ?
i' il light a fire .
please , let us go .
my machine is inside .
i must find a way to get it out .
no , you mustn' t .
help me gather some wood .
that' s a girl .
where are you from ?
as a matter of fact , i' m from right here .
that' s where my house used to be . . . . . . many thousands of years ago .
you see there ?
up to those panels was my laboratory .
beyond them was where my garden used to be .
right there .
that was my library .
where i once sat talking with friends about . . . . . . the time machine .
you know , weena . . .
. . . l' d hoped to learn such a great deal .
i hoped to take back the knowledge and advancement man had made .
lnstead , i find vegetables .
the human race reduced to living vegetables .
they' re gone .
are you all right ?
was that a morlock ?
yes .
don' t you worry .
the fire seems to keep them away .
what are you doing ?
why did you put your hand there ?
i never saw it before .
no knowledge of fire .
no books .
i' m terribly sorry .
i had no right to be angry with your people .
no more than if i' d visited the island of bali in my own time .
but , you know , weena . . . .
you were safe inside your house , yet came out to warn me .
the characteristic which distinguished man from animals . . . . . . was the spirit of self sacrifice .
and you have that quality .
so do all your people .
it just needs someone to reawaken it .
i' d like to try , if you' il let me .
will you ?
i do not understand . . .
. . . but i believe you .
that' s as good a start as any .
try to tell me .
the morlocks who or what are they ?
are they animals or people ?
well , what about yourself ?
don' t your people ever speak of the past ?
there is no past .
well , do they ever wonder about the future ?
there is no future .
the past . . . . . . man' s past . . .
. . . is mainly a grim struggle for survival .
but there have been moments when a few voices have spoken up . . .
. . . and these rare moments have made man' s past . . . . . . a glorious thing .
i refuse to believe it' s dead and gone .
we' ve had dark ages before .
this is just another one .
all it needs is someone to show you the way out .
i' m only a mechanic , but . . . . . . l' m sure there must be that spark in one of you .
lf only i can kindle that spark . . . . . . my coming here will have meaning .
my efforts to open the panel were fruitless .
i had to find another way to retrieve my machine .
listen .
do you hear that ?
yes .
machines ?
no , morlocks .
wait .
those animals run machines ?
they are morlocks .
have you ever seen the machines ?
no , only heard of them .
who told you ?
the rings .
what sort of rings ?
rings that talk .
could you show me these rings ?
come , this way .
these are the talking rings ?
yes .
they speak ?
of what ?
things no one here understands .
make it talk .
now in its 326th year , the war between the east and west ... ... has at last come to an end .
there' s nothing to fight with and few left to fight .
the atmosphere has become so polluted with germs ... ... that it can no longer be breathed .
there is no place left that is immune .
the last factory for the manufacture of oxygen has been destroyed .
stockpiles are rapidly diminishing ... ... and when they are gone , we must die .
my name is of no consequence .
you should know that i am the last who remembers how each of us ... ... man and woman , made his own decision .
some chose to take refuge in the great caverns ... ... and find a new way of life below the earth ' s surface .
the rest of us decided to take our chances in the sunlight ... ... small as those chances might be .
from the talking rings i learned how the human race divided ... ... and how the world of the eloi and the morlocks began .
by some awful quirk of fate ... ... the morlocks became the masters and the eloi their servants .
the morlocks maintained them and bred them like ... ... like cattle ... ... only to take them below when they reached maturity .
which explained why there were no older people .
i knew i must go below .
it was the only way to reach my machine ... ... and discover what happened to the older people .
don' t go !
you won' t come back !
i' il be back .
weena ?
answer me !
where are you ?
what' s happening ?
what' s happening ?
what' s the matter with you all ?
weena , stop !
stop !
what happens to them ?
don' t stand there like fatted cattle !
will you answer me ?
what is wrong ?
nothing is wrong .
it is all clear .
what do you mean , all clear ?
all clear .
ln the mid 1 900s , the bombs , the people calling out , " all clear !
no !
that' s gone !
that' s passed !
there' s no more flying machines !
no bombs !
no more wars !
the rings have told us that story .
but you didn' t listen !
you didn' t learn !
it was ages ago that men were taught to hide when the sirens blew . . . . . . to run from death , but it' s over !
those men and those who slaughtered them are dead !
but there is nothing to fear .
it is all clear .
what about the ones who went below ?
how will they come back ?
they never come back .
nobody can bring them back .
you can try .
you can try !
won' t even one of you try ? !
well , i' il try !
so this was the destiny of the eloi .
cannibalism !
wake up !
come to your senses !
all of you !
burn .
give me something to burn .
it' s my last match .
get up the stairs !
that' s the way out !
the torch !
get the torch !
get up the steps !
hurry up !
gather all the deadwood !
all the wood !
that' s fine .
come on , throw it down !
all the deadwood !
throw it down !
do the same to the other wells !
all the wood down the wells !
all right , to the river !
back to the river !
all right , let' s go !
another night was coming , but this night no eloi needed to fear .
the underworld of the morlocks was gone ... ... and so was the life of leisure for the eloi .
but then what of me ?
i was imprisoned in a world ... ... in which ijust did not belong .
are you sorry ?
sorry ?
sorry for what ?
that you have to stay ?
yes .
i could tell so much to the people of my time .
i' d let them know . . . . . . about the sorrow and happiness that the future holds .
maybe they could learn from it .
or could they ?
you don' t want to stay , do you ?
it isn' t that .
it' s just that i don' t fit here any more than you would in my time .
i would love to see your time .
you wouldn' t be very happy there .
do you have someone there ?
someone like me ?
no one like you .
i have friends who will miss me , of course .
i' m probably late already .
women ?
no .
there is one woman .
she looks after my house for me .
she' s 62 years old and all wrinkled .
how do they wear their hair ?
who ?
the women of your time .
up .
up ?
up how ?
i don' t know .
kind of . . . . . . up , like that .
show me !
would i be pretty ?
yes , you would .
very pretty .
i wish we could go back to my time .
or even before that , when the world was young .
we could be so very happy .
look !
my machine !
come on , weena !
i was going the wrong way !
back !
i had to go back !
it' s the most ridiculous story i' ve ever heard .
preposterous !
george , you always could tell a good yarn .
you' re a truly great inventor , george .
i think you ought to retire , sir .
truthfully , george , where have you been the past week ?
don' t ask such questions .
it is not hard for a man to lose a week now and again .
i can understand your doubt .
take it as a lie if you wish .
i scarcely believe it myself , now that i' m back .
david , there' s the flower weena gave me .
a present for you .
you' re interested in botany .
try to match that with any known species !
i don' t think i can .
time to go , bridewell .
yes , it is getting late .
good night , george .
good night , george .
you look exhausted .
you really should get some rest .
good night .
it' s grand having you back .
goodbye , david .
thanks for being such a good friend .
always .
what do you think , filby ?
one thing is certain .
that flower couldn' t bloom in the wintertime .
you don' t really believe that story ?
good night .
go on , driver .
mr. filby , what ?
he' s gone !
why , look !
i think i understand .
you see the imprint ?
this is where it originally stood .
the morlocks moved it .
they dragged it across the lawn . . . . . . right into the sphinx .
right there .
weena was standing here when he last saw her .
right here !
the same space in a different time .
he dragged his heavy machine back in here . . . . . . scratching the floor . . . . . . so he could appear outside the sphinx again . . . . . . and help the eloi build a new world .
build a new world for himself .
right where he left her .
yes .
it' s not like george to return empty handed .
to try to rebuild a civilization without a plan .
he must have taken something with him .
nothing .
except three books .
which three books ?
i don' t know . ls it important ?
i suppose not .
only . . . . . . which three would you have taken ?
do you think he' il ever return ?
one cannot choose but wonder .
you see , he has all the time in the world .
