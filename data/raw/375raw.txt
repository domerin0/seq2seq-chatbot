i want your butt down here tomorrow .
i am the boss , jack !
okay ?

i can' t believe you guys kept this cat .
richie and i used to hide stuff from our mom underneath all the cookies .
i' m pretty sure she knew , but i don' t think she really cared .
so were you two guys okay ?
what ?
i mean you and richie ?
i mean , before the accident , were you two getting along okay ?
what kind of question is that ?
it' s just a question .
was he drinking a lot more ?
more than normal ?
what ?
jack ....
it' s just that eddie said he didn' t see him drink much .
doreen said he wouldn' t drink and drive .
i' m just wondering if
what are you doing ?
what ?
why do you care all of a sudden ?
because he' s dead ?
where were you when he was alive ?
he was your brother .
you disappeared on him , and now he' s gone .
so what am i supposed to do ?
take a trip down memory lane with you ?
catch you up on how he' s doing ?
what do you think you' re gonna do , come here and fix things ?
you don' t fix things , jack .
you break things .

fucking white of you to call .
fletcher just ripped me a new asshole .

i got some things to do .
okay , here' s the truth as i know it .
i don' t know how much longer i can cover your ass .
are we gonna see fletcher ?
absolutely .
we are flying in .
we are there .
you got something to say ?
what do you wanna say ?
it' s time to sit down and chop it up with the big dog .
because i' m hearing talk , jack .
people are talking .
about you .
and audrey .
i don' t know if i can keep it from him .
they must be hearing it from you .
am i right ?
you simple bitch !
i' m covering your ass .
do you hear me ?
i' m covering your ass !
you better cover your own ass .
which way is brumby' s office ?
no , you listen .
i don' t want to hear you can' t find it .
this was supposed to be done .
a guy died the other night .
can you hold on a second ?
can i help you with something ?
i' m jack carter , richie' s brother .
i' il call you right back .
christ .
i' m sorry i wasn' t at the funeral .
never could take them .
would you like some coffee or something ?
no , i' m fine , thanks .
he was a good bloke , richie was .
saved my ass a lot of money just by doing a solid job .
so how long was he running this place for you ?
since we' ve been up .
about five years .
five years and no problems ?
none .
no enemies ?
well , not that i know of .
i mean , he was an easy going sort of bloke .
does he seem like a guy that would get dead drunk ... ... and go out driving in a rain storm ?
not to me .
me neither .
where is this going ?
i think he was taken out .
taken out ?
richie ?
why would you say that ?
there' s something you' re not telling me .
what the bloody hell does that mean ?
relax .
i don' t like hard cases coming in here and talking to me like i know something .
if there' s someone putting out something about me then i want to know who it is .
when i know what it is and who' s been saying it ... ... l might just take the matter up with you , jack .
mightn' t l ?
you' re a big man , but you' re out of shape .
with me , it' s a full time job , so please , sit down .
thank you .
now , i know that you have security cameras around the bar .
did the police ask to look at the tapes ?
why would they ?
it was drunk driving .
do you mind if i do ?
that' s got the whole night on it .
did you talk to geraldine ?
who' s geraldine ?
oh , christ .
how am i gonna put this ?
she was his lady on the side , his inamorata .
you know this for sure ?
what can i tell you ?
it wasn' t a big thing .
not many people knew about it .
cyrus .
how are you doing ?
holy shit .
well , if it ain' t the vegas man with the vegas tan .
geraldine , right ?

i appreciate that .
you' re still running with fletcher ?
why not ?
how are you making a living ?
well , i' m making .
with who ?
with somebody .
what do you care ?
i don' t care .
i just want to know if you' re still a bottom feeder .
let me tell you something , jack .
you see all this shit here ?
you see it ?
this is the new world , brother .
i' m on line .
these are my girls .
my business .
while you' re running around chasing deadbeats for some fucking asshole ... ... i' m swimming in the big pool , baby .
i got the juice around here , now .
i hooked up with this freak and this foreign guy .
created my own little empire .
look at you .
the little man first to start up .
you got a problem with me ?
let me tell you something , jack .
i think you should take a big moment ... ... and just think about where you are .
because this ain' t yesterday , slick .
relax , i' m just playing with you a little bit .
yeah , i get that .
don' t put your hands on me .
come on , let me see your eyes .
come on .
whatever turns you on , jack .
still pretty ?
like cat piss in the snow .
see you around .
hey , you can' t come in here .
hey , mate , where are you going ?
is this the part where i' m supposed to be scared ?
you carter ?
that' s right .
and you really don' t want to know me .
shit , it' s good to be home .
damn you , cyrus , i never met the guy .
get off .
i don' t know him , okay ?
shut up and get in the car .
good afternoon .

nice stroke .
who the fuck are you ?
tiger woods .
i' m gonna go and get security , all right ?

is there a problem ?
my brother died the other night , and now i' m here .
listen , mr ....
carter .
carter .
mr. carter .
i' m real sorry about your brother .
that sucks .
but i can' t help you here .
i suggest you contact my outreach program over at the offices
mind if we talk a minute ?
yes , i mind .
i was under the impression this was a private club .
i think we should go some place and talk .
listen , scary man  i scare you ?
whatever this is , it isn' t going over real well .
drive me back to my car .
we' il talk on the way .
is that a problem ?
it is a problem .
no , it' s a problem if you don' t .
come on .
it' s okay .
so , what' s your name ?
jeremy kinnear .
maybe you' ve read about me in forbes .
i don' t do that , jeremy .
what are you telling me ?
you' re bucks up ?
without blowing the proverbial horn ... ... my computer company is worth about a gazillion dollars .
give or take .
your folks must be very proud .
i paid off my student loans , bought them a house in france .
they leave me alone .
i think we' ve got a mutual acquaintance , jeremy .
really ?
yeah .
cyrus paice .
yeah , i know him .
i try not to spend too much time around him , though .
what' s the connection ?
you know , mr. carter , i really don' t have to answer your questions .
sure you do , jeremy .
what' s the connection ?
okay , mr. carter , fine .
when you spend most of your life stuck behind a computer ... ... things like golf and girls become pretty important .
they don' t go well with the glasses ... ... and pocket protector image my stockholders prefer .
so  so , he pulls for you .
you know why i like golf , mr. carter ?
' cause the ball just keeps going away .
only sport where you hit that little sucker and it doesn' t come back at you .
i' ve got to want to go after it and get it .
and when i get to it ... ... l just knock it away again .
see what i' m saying , mr. carter ?
once i get rid of it ... ... l never want to see it again .
he said his brother died the other night and now he' s here .
he' s here !
you get me ?
we are fucked !
excuse me , mr. kinnear .
can you get your feet off the table ?
yes .
no , you listen to me .
you asked me to get you on line , i did that .
fair trade .
then you start this porn thing .
i said , " keep me clean , " you can' t even do that .
i don' t want to think what happens if he' s taken that thing to the police .
how' d he get it , anyway ?
it was supposed to go straight to the hard drive .
damn right i' m freaking out !
i' m a harvard grad .
i do not do porn .
no , shush !
i don' t want to know what happened the other night .
i don' t care .
it' s none of my business .
i just want the big brother gone .
i don' t mean " gone " like you " goned " the other guy .
i mean away .
i want him away , i want you away .
i want the whole thing done .
where' s the big bad wolf ?
out with the pigs , i guess .
he wants you to come back and
i was thinking that , when i get back , you and me ... ... we gotta get out of vegas for good , you know ?
jack , i can' t do this .
do what ?
you and me .
les fletcher is my job , it' s what i do .
you ... ... you' re ... ... you' re something different .
all right , fine .
you ought to get out of there , with or without me ... ... but you gotta get out .
audrey !
i' m up here !
get your ass down here .
i gotta go .
yeah , it' s good .
another time , another place ?
yeah .
' bye .
sometimes i feel i' m gonna be alone for the rest of my life .
i wake up in the morning , i look over at my little girl ... ... and i wonder when it was we became strangers .
she' s all i have now , jack , and i want her back so bad ... ... and i don' t even know where she went .
she won' t talk to me .
she won' t even yell at me .
oh , my god .
who are you ?
what ?
i mean , i' m just trying to make sense of this .
of you .
you disappear off the face of the earth for five years ... ... then you come back .
i don' t know , you look like frank sinatra or something and ....
i just can' t figure you out .
you know , it' s not that big a deal , gloria .
everything changes , they say .
why not me ?
you want to try to do something right .
once .
yeah , well , what is that , though ?
what' s right , jack , you know ?
you' re too late to be richie' s brother .
you can' t be doreen' s father .
and you can' t be my man .
so , i just don' t know where you fit .
maybe i don' t .
maybe i don' t .
i' m sorry .
eddie !
you know geraldine ?
what ?
geraldine .
do you know where she lives ?
i don' t know , man .
the girl that hung around with richie .
do you know where she lives ?
a girl ?
what ?
come on .
so , you know doreen much ?
yeah , a little .
it' s right up here on the left .
so , you done with me , man ?
no .
sit tight , i' il be right back .
relax , everything is okay .
how are you doing ?
i' m looking for geraldine .
do you know where she is ?
what was richie to you ?
you can' t just break into my house .
what was he to you ?
i told you .
i met him at the bar .
he was just a guy i met .
that' s all .
that' s all ?
he was nicer than most .
did you know he was married ?
no .
did you know that ?
what do you want ?
i talked to him .
it' s not a crime .
i gotta be somewhere .
i want to know what happened .
you don' t want to know .
look at me .
look at me .
i didn' t come up here to hurt you .
i just wanna know what happened .
richie wanted me to leave with him .
he and his wife weren' t getting along so well .
hardly spoke , you know ?
they were gonna get divorced .
he wanted me to run away someplace like new york or something .
i said i couldn' t do that .
i got my own life here .
yeah .
so , i went to the bar to say goodbye and he followed me out .
and he makes this big scene outside the bar .
i hear he got pretty drunk .
look , i don' t want to talk about this anymore .
the keys are in it .
looks like the rain must have backed up the sewer .
how you been , man ?
still hanging around here , thorpey ?
i like it here .
i got to have a word with you , all right ?
confidential .
you just stay in the car .
i' il listen .
what do you want to tell me ?
how you been , man ?
i mean , you look good .
thank you .
i' m losing sleep here , so what do you want ?
here , take this .
it' s free .
alaska airlines , first class .
that' s nice .
and who do i have to thank ?
i' ve been asked to make sure you get on that plane .
tonight .
whatever they' re paying you , it won' t be enough .
what the fuck is going on ?
what you wanna do , cowboy ?
you wanna get rough ?
come on .
take your best shot .
come on , shoot .
you got the stuff ?
you got the balls ?
you got the guts , do it .
put the gun down .
there' s no dishonor in avoiding confrontation .
in dealing with an armed man , the best course of action is to run .
no !
come on .
get back !
outta the way !
shit !
okay .
fuck .
the ride' s over .
he had me deliver the ticket ... ... ' cause you hung around with my brother .
i knew you wouldn' t go for it !
who sent you ?
i can' t tell you that .
did you have something to do with it ?
i had nothing to do with richie .
then give me a name , or you' re history .
brumby' s in the back .
carter ?
so , now you' re a travel agent .
what ?
that was a real nice touch , sending thorpey .
very nostalgic .
what are you talking about ?
what' d richie have on you ?
bloody hell , jack !
richie was my friend .
what does it take , a fucking miracle for you to believe that ?
you' re not giving me anything here .
all right , jack .
stop that , for fuck' s sake .
look , okay .
i owed this bloke some money .
he fronted a truck load last year to extend the club .
he calls me this afternoon , says he' il wipe the slate clean ... ... if i' il do this thing for him .
he said he wanted you out of town .
that' s all .
he didn' t say how , just out of town .
you' re brother was my friend .
i wouldn' t hurt him .
give me a name or this is going to another level .
cyrus paice .
you want me out ?
you want me out ?
you want to do this ?
rabbit' s outta the hat , jack .
let' s see if it jumps .
what did you do to richie ?
goddamn you !
i didn' t do nothing .
i hate to be the bearer of bad news , but you' re chasing your ass .
you were gone too long , brother .
shit changes .
maybe not you , but some shit does change .
your brother , your precious brother richie ... ... was no goddamn saint .
everybody' s into something , jack .
plain and simple , all right ?
there' s no mystery , no intrigue .
he got juiced up one night , he got oiled up ... ... and he wrapped his sorry ass around a tree .
end of story .
now if you wanna do this little dance here for old time' s sake ... ... bring it .
let me tell you something .
you' il end up like a one legged man ... ... in an ass kicking contest .
i' m tired of your bullshit , jack .
i' m a businessman .
i got ladies waiting for me on the inside .
grow up , jack .
uncle jack !
i didn' t think you were gonna show up .
i was in the neighborhood .

so , if you don' t mind ....

it' s the straight ones we got to worry about .

what did your father tell you ?
he didn' t .
that' s good .
mom said you were a gambler .

for how long ?
how about this weather ?
come on !
what do you say we change the subject ?
all right .
fine .
you ever shoot anybody ?
you want to know what i do for a living ?

people make promises and they break them .
my job is to refresh their memory .
that' s about it .
no big deal .
what' s with the clothes ?
what' s with the jewelry in your face ?
you don' t like it .
it' s nice .

i don' t think so .
so , you don' t have a family of your own .
what are you ?
why' d you leave ?
well , doreen , that' s a long , long story .
it' s a long , long ride .
let' s put it this way : did you ever want to take every mirror in the world and ... ... get rid of it ' cause you didn' t like what was coming back at you ?
yeah .
i wish my dad was here .
me too .
do you really think somebody killed him ?
yeah , i think so , but ....

yep .

dad taught me .
yeah ?
doreen , would you wait in the car ?

what happened ?
i have no idea where she is .
who did it ?
he came in , i don' t know .
are you okay ?
it' s gonna be all right .

i don' t know .
but i want to find out , you can believe that .
come on , let' s go get your mom .
where are we going ?
i want you guys to stay with me tonight , okay ?
gloria , why don' t we get out of here ?
i' m fine .
i' m okay .
i need to talk to your uncle jack alone .

it was your idea to call her .
listen , i don' t mind .
she cares about you , she loves you .
that' s pretty special .

it' s a real scary place out there , so i don' t blame her .
you must be a little tired .
i' il tell you what : why don' t you take the bed ?
i got a lot of work to do in the other room .
i' il take you home in the morning , okay ?
it' s gonna be all right , really .
i was coming for you .

it' s all my fault .

it' s not your fault .
none of this is your fault .

yeah ?
jack ?
who is this ?
it' s geraldine .
look , i didn' t know she was richie' s daughter .
when i found out who she was , i got the disc to richie right away .
i didn' t know what he' d do with it .
he went to them and he said he was taking the disc to the cops .
cyrus knows i gave him the disc .
he' s on his way here .
he' s coming over now , jack !
i didn' t know who to call , i was just ....
shit !
i' m sorry .
i' m so sorry .
where' s eddie ?
he' s not working today .
where' s he live ?
what' s going on ?
where does he live ?
will you listen to me ?
for just a minute .
i' ve been in it all my life , on both sides of the ocean .
i' m telling you this , if you get mixed up in ... ... whatever it was your brother was into , you got a good chance ... ... to winding up exactly the same as he did .
and those two ladies are gonna have to go into mourning all over again .
getting yourself killed won' t bring richie back .
revenge doesn' t work .
sure it does .
they knew what they were getting into  don' t play me !
that was cyrus ' deal , man !
he probably killed your brother .
right ?
it wasn' t fucking me !
he' s at a fucking party right now ... ... at some fucking fencing club or something , with kinnear , right ?
i was just fucking playing around !
go get them .
i' m having a really hard time understanding something , eddie .
what could she have done to you ... ... that was so bad that you' d want to do this to her ?
' cause what you did doesn' t go away !
she trusted you !
and you raped her .
she was my brother' s daughter .
my family .
and it' s my fault .
' cause if i had been here , this never would have gone down .
so now i gotta make it right .
i gotta do that .
i mean , what would you do if it was your daughter ?
jack , don' t kill me , man .
you killed yourself .
jack , stop !
get him !
go !
jack !
jack , stop !
goddamn it !
motherfucker !

i don' t think you could handle jail for the rest of your life , jack .
i want to tell you something , slick .
the man you want ... ... is that little piss ass kinnear .
him and the old guy , so stop breaking my balls , all right ?
i' m a goddamn businessman just trying to stay afloat , just like you .
you' re nothing like me .
excuse me , wait a minute , jack .
all of a sudden you care ?
all of a sudden what are you ?
some kind of fucking good guy ?
you' re the bad brother , remember ?
i know who i am .
listen , i would love to sit here and jaw with you ... ... but i gotta get back to the talent .
let it go .
come on , jack , let' s see what you got .
jack , come on .
goddamn , jack .
your little brother put up a better fight than you did .
you should finish what you start .
fix your tie a little bit there .
have a good time .
where is it , richie ?

let' s take a ride .
where are we going , mr. carter ?
slow down .

i didn' t do it .

what do you want , mr. carter ?
you want a clean slate ?

please slow down , you' re gonna kill us !
that' s the point , jeremy .
okay .
you want money ?
you want money , name your price .
i' ve got more money than god !
you need a drink .
it' s okay .
it' s all right , jeremy .
is this how you did it to richie ?
is this how you did it , jeremy ?
you think he screamed too ?
you like it ?
i didn' t kill your brother , mr. carter !
get up .
mr. carter , you' re making a mistake .
get up .
move !
listen to me .
you' re making a mistake .
cyrus told me your brother was going to go to the police with this disc .
he said if he went down , i' d go down .
i didn' t know what to do , mr. carter .
so you had him killed .
no !
i just said to him to get the disc back , that' s all .
i had nothing to do with it .
i swear .
i told cyrus to go and get the disc ... ... and that our business together would be over .
that' s all .
mr. carter , i swear to you !
i swear to you !
i didn' t do anything .
i didn' t kill him , mr. carter , please believe me !
he said if i said anything ... ... he would ruin me !
and then you ... ... you came along .
please , mr. carter !
it was cyrus .
he killed your brother and geraldine , not me .
he said he was working with some guy .
it was them .
they did it .
no more talk .
turn around .
please , don' t .
turn around .
be a man , for once in your life .
i' m gonna do something for you ... ... nobody ever did for me .
i' m gonna give you a second chance .
please don' t make me come back .
no .
no .
i won' t , mr. carter .
thank you .
thank you so much .
i promise i won' t make you come back .
thank you .
what are you doing ?
sorry , jack .
i don' t usually get my hands dirty , but i checked your room ... ... and there was nothing there .
listen .
about this ... ... doreen thing .
she' il be all right , i think .
kids are resilient , you know .
and this thing with richie , i mean , christ , that was bloody awful .
i don' t know what cyrus was thinking , but ... ... a man' s got to make a living .
i tried to keep you out of it , but you insisted on this post facto ... ... big brother thing .
so , i figured ... ... if i left enough dangling ... ... you would find my disc for me .
what a mess .
all over a shiny piece of plastic .
listen .
i' il get rid of the disc .
you seem to have gotten rid of everything else .
you may have hardware concealed about your person .
if you kill me , you' il be on the run for the rest of your life .
it' s been nice knowing you , jack .
brumby .
i' m not turning around .
suit yourself .
uncle jack .
your mother told me i' d find you here .
i thought you were gone .
i am gone .
i just wanted to come by ... ... say goodbye to you , face to face .
what happened to your beard thing ?
that ?
i thought it would be time for a change .
i just got rid of it .
did you fall again ?
this ?
yeah , i did .
i fell down again .
get new shoes .
we' re gonna be okay , you know .
mom and me .
i know .
thanks for being here .
it would' ve meant a lot to dad .
he was a good man .
yeah .
guess you gotta go ?
yeah .
do you remember when i said , " you' re special " ?
you better remember that or you' re gonna have a big problem with me , okay ?
take care of yourself , doreen .
you too .
i like the new look .
