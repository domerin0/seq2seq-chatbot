he' s deaf .
the shell went off right beside him .
camera on his shoulder saved his life .
you hear that , max ?
your stupid camera saved your stupid life .
where were you ?
out there in the pine barrens .
we were attached to a national guard unit .
the 83rd mechanized .
they moved on one of those things around midnight .
they got some kind of shield around them .
you can' t see it , but everything we fire at them detonates too early , before we can get close enough to cause any damage .
when they flash that thing , everything lights up like hiroshima .
there' s more than one ?
you gotta be kidding me , right ?
we were feeding new york , but new york went dark .
so we patched over to d. c. , they went down .
l. a. , chicago , uplinked to london .
even called the affiliates to try to get them to catch the feed , but nobody answers .
it' s the same everywhere .
once the tripods start to move , no more news comes out of that area .
my god .
you ain' t seen nothing yet .
i saw that storm .
i was right in the middle of one of those .
well , you didn' t see it like this .
those machines come up from under the ground , right ?
so that means they must' ve been buried here a long time ago .
so who' s driving the goddamn things ?
watch the lightning .
watch it .
watch the lightning .
keep watching the lightning .
what is that ?
that is them .
they come down in capsules , riding the lightning into the ground , into the machines , right ?
you hear that ?
we' re getting the hell out of here .
get in , get in , get in , get in .
hey , were you on that plane ?
that' s too bad .
it would' ve been a really great story .
look at me .
look at me .
you keep your eyes only on me , understand ?
okay .
don' t look down .
don' t look around .
i' m taking you to the car .
you' re gonna wanna look around .
but you' re not going to .
are you ?
no .
you' re doing good .
you' re doing good .
keep your eyes on me .
i' m going right to boston .
we' re gonna see your mom .
i' m not gonna look , dad .
that' s a girl .
that' s my girl .
now listen .
i want you to close your eyes , okay ?

there you go .
keep them closed for me .
okay .
robbie , get in .
robbie , get in !
why are you yelling ?
it' s okay .
get in .
why aren' t we on the turnpike ?
i don' t want everybody to see that we' ve got a working car .
we' il stay along the hudson till we find an open bridge or ferry , then we' re gonna cross the hudson .
we' il take the back roads across connecticut , all the way to boston .
where is everybody ?
i don' t know , running , hiding .
in their basements .
if we had balls , we' d go back
and find one of those things and kill it .
right .
yeah , good .
why don' t you just let me make the big decisions .
which would be when ?
never , ray ?
never' s about your speed .
stop it .
enough of the " ray " shit .

it' s " dad , " " sir , " don' t fight .
or if you want , " mr. ferrier .
that sounds a little weird to me , but you decide .
dad ?
yes , rachel .
i' ve gotta go to the bathroom .
really ?
i gotta go .
not so fast , not so fast , all right ?
there' s two things we gotta watch out for .
and the second is people who might want our car .
there' s nobody around .
yeah .
i gotta go .
all right , rachel ?
rachel , it' s good right there .
i' m not going in front of you guys .
just go where i can see you .
are you crazy ?
don' t look !
i' m not gonna look .

robbie !
where are you trying to go ?
what are you trying to do ?
who' s gonna take care of me if you go ?
this is a test of the emergency alert system .
if this had been an actual emergency , official messages from federal , state or local authorities would' ve followed the alert tone .
this concludes the test of the emergency alert ...
