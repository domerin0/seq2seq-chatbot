the beginning is always today .
one of my favorite quotes .
president wagner , what a pleasant surprise .
so , what ex citing new beginnings ... can we look forward to this year ?
well , for the most part , i' il continue with ... the overall dire ction of the program .
that dire ction is a losing one .
i don' t think we can measure the su c cess of our program ... by the number of people ... shaking their butts in the stands ... and no , we didn' t win the b. e. t. classi c ... but our fiirst obligation is to edu cate ... and then entertain .
please , not the edu tainment spee ch, james .
save it for your students .
it' s a good one .
the kids in my program are learning .
there won' t be a program ... if the alumni continue to lose interest .
we win , they write che cks .
dr. henderson was smart enough to know that .
he played popular musi c .
that was james brown and marvin gaye ... not the thong song .
now , i will play popular musi c ... but not at the expense of musi cianship .
when you hired me ... you wanted me to strive for ex cellen ce ... and that is exa ctly what i am doing .
i also said we needed to win .
1 , 2 .
1 , 2 .

i want your knees hitting your chest .

always remember this .
playin ' the drums ... it' s like makin ' love .

let' s take this from the top ... and this time , follow me .
don' t look down , remember ?

congratulations .
you' re not crabs anymore .
now you' re crab drummers .
and tomorrow ... it' s tree shaking eliminations ... whi ch will determine who will be come a& t drummers .
so tonight , celebrate ... ' cause you made it through training .
after you prove a thorough knowledge of the rule book .
what is mandatory of all a& t musi cians ?
all a& t musi cians must read musi c .
when can a p 2 or p 3 ... challenge for a spot on the fiield ?
at the pra cti ce before the performan ce , sir .
what is ...
last rule of the rule book ?

a ctually , dr. lee , why don' t we let devon run it ?
oh , nah .
you the big dog .
do your thing .
no , i really think it' d help if somebody else played it .
i wouldn' t do it no justi ce .
what are you two beavis and bla ck head ?
it doesn' t have to be perfe ct , devon .
i just want to hear it .
come on .
you kno cked that caden ce out i did ... in , like , a minute .
you got it .
go on , rip it , dog .
go on , dog .
let' s go , devon .
what' s wrong , d ?
mr. miles , is there a problem ?
don' t feel like playing that wa ck ass caden ce .
yo , that was a bit ch move , sean .
it' s obvious , if anybody bothered to pay attention .
personally , i don' t give a damn ... if the boy can' t read a book .
he' s strong , and you know it .
have some respe ct for your se ction , robert .
snares have a standard .
it' s my job to prote ct the line and that' s what i did .
you don' t like it , follow his ass out .
you lied on your appli cation ... you lied at your audition ... when you played the required pie ce ... and you lied to me .
i didn' t think it was that big a deal .
play that .
that' s the musi c for next week' s game ... and you can' t read it .
and as far as i' m con cerned ... that' s a very big deal .
i' m enrolling you ... in the applied per cussion course .
man , that gives me 5 classes .
damn right it gives you 5 classes ... and it ought to be 1 0 ... espe cially if you plan on getting ba ck on the line ... anytime soon .
what you mean getting ba ck on the line ?
i mean now you' re a p 4 .
if you cannot read musi c ... you cannot be on my fiield .
man , you can' t take me off the line .
i' m the best drummer you got .
ain' t can' t no class tea ch me how to do me .
ex cuse me ?
doing me is what got me down here in the fiirst pla ce .
no , lying ... is what got you down here .
and if you don' t have the honor and dis cipline ... to learn your craft ... then quite frankly , devon , you don' t deserve to be here .
i don' t get you sometimes .
if musi c is what you love ... why wouldn' t you go to class ?
you love dan ce , right ?
why you ain' t studying that ?
my parents are paying for my edu cation .
and to them ... dan cing' s not a real major .
well , is it real to you ?
be cause when i see you doing your thing out on the fiield , you look happy .
that seems real to me .
it' s not always about doing what you love ... all the time , devon .
see , i don' t even get that , like , so why you even come to a& t ?
i always knew i' d be here .
both my parents went to a& t.
my mom' s a sigma phi alpha my dad' s the all ameri can .
just ohh .
you' il meet them at home coming .

this is how it' s done .
dr. lee ... do you want to explain why devon is not on the fiield ?
not really .
no , let me rephrase .
i want my boy on the fiield now .
there are some issues preventing that .
no , the only issue ... is for you to give me the same show ...
like you did the last game ... or there won' t be a program next year .
i can' t believe we ain' t stepping to them fools .
that' s a straight up challenge .
a& t going out like some punks .
is this how they make you earn your s cholarship ?
mr. wayne , morris brown college .

but i bet dr. lee grounded you , didn' t he ?
a ctually , he ki cked me off the band .
i' m sorry to hear that , son .
but see , that' s what happens ... when a talented brother like yourself don' t have a real pla ce to shine .
uh , you know , mr. wade ...
i was wonderin ' if maybe you had a spa ce for me ... on your band next year .
that' s a defiinite possibility .
but i want you to think very carefully about that
then you come ba ck and see me .
in the meantime , i' il talk to the coa ches ... about the s cholarship situation .
all right .
thanks .
all right .
look , i might as well tell you this up front .
what' s that ?
i can' t really read musi c .
ha ha !
don' t worry about that .
a lot of folks can' t read the sign that says " toilet .
don' t mean they don' t know how to use one .
you want one ?
ok .
just on ce , could a brother get a sli ce of pizza ?
hi .
devon .
oh , snap , now you can see me ?
look , i pani cked .
my parents were talking all that crap ... about " that hoodlum on the fiield that started the fiight , " and i just ...
devon , i' m i' m sorry .
it ain' t about your parents .
you left me hanging .
you know how that feels ?
no ?
let me show you .
dr. lee ?
dr. lee .
i just wanted to cat ch you before rehearsal .
i was thinkin ' that instead of promoting ... a p 2 to repla ce devon ... we might just keep the snare line at 9 .
and how long have you been thinking that ?
just this mornin ' .
are you sure ?
i thought maybe it was the day you showed us all he couldn' t read ... or maybe it was the night he took your solo .
i don' t know .
but sin ce you heard him play ... you de cided that the line or perhaps maybe just you ... would be better off without him .
remember when i fiirst made you se ction leader ?
you were sweatin ' bullets , wondering how you could lead ... this loud , passionate group of your peers ... and i said you would be fiine .
remember why ?
you said i loved the sound of the line ... more than the sound of my own drum .
yes , and you' ve lost sight of that ... and that' s ok be cause we all lose sight of things sometimes .
but if you don' t get it together , mr. taylor ... you' re gonna have a diffii cult time ...
leading the senate whether devon is on it or not .
now i put in a word with mr. hill ... to get you some fiinan cial aid next year ... hook you up with a part time job this summer ... put some money in your po cket .
you know you need some money , hmm ?
hmm ?
yeah .
yeah , everybody needs some money ... and the b. e. t. southern classi c comin ' up .
where you gonna sit , on the ground ?

so now , what can you tell me ?
what you mean , what can i tell you ?
what you mean ?
what do i mean ?
oh , i know dr. lee is workin ' on somethin ' big for the classi c .
the man' s too damn stubborn ... to sit down and take ... his butt whippin ' like a man .
you know that .
i don' t know .
there you go again .
you don' t know .
at least a play list .
no , i don' t have no idea .
lookie here , son ...
i' m talkin ' about throwin ' a lot of fiinan cial aid your way next year .
you need to give me somethin ' .
meet me halfway on this thing .
you don' t wanna pass up a deal like this .
look , man , i don' t know what dr. lee got planned .
whatever it is , i hope he wipes y' all up with it .
fake ass alligator shoes .

not a bad idea at all .
we' re gonna try something ... a little different this year ... a little of my old s chool ... with a little of your new ... honoring the past and the present at the same time .
and that' s what our new dire ction is all about
bridging the gap .
our new pie ce for the b. e. t. big southern classi c ... was arranged by 2 of your very own ...
mr. devon miles and mr. sean taylor .
this pie ce is very compli cated ... but it' s not half as compli cated ... as the formations are going to be .
we won' t have any time to waste here , people ... so as you would say ...
