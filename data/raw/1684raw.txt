this is a story of an ordinary little boy ... ... named charlie bucket .
he was not faster or stronger or more clever than other children .
his family was not rich or powerful or well connected .
in fact , they barely had enough to eat .
charlie bucket was the luckiest boy in the entire world .
he just didn ' t know it yet .
evening , buckets .
evening .
hi , dad .
soup' s almost ready , darling .
don' t suppose there' s anything extra to put in , love .
oh , well .
nothing goes better with cabbage than cabbage .
charlie ... ... i found something i think you' il like .
charlie' s father worked at the local toothpaste factory .
the hours were long , and the pay was terrible ... ... yet occasionally , there were unexpected surprises .
it ' s exactly what i need .
what is it , charlie ?
dad found it , just the piece i needed .
what piece was it ?
a head for willy wonka .
well , how wonderful .
it' s quite a likeness .
you think so ?
think so ?
i know so .
i saw willy wonka with my own two eyes .
i used to work for him , you know .
you did ?
i did .
he did .
he did .
i love grapes .
of course , i was a much younger man in those days .
willy wonka began with a single store on cherry street .
but the whole world wanted his candy .
mr. wonka .
yeah ?
we need more wonka bars ...
... and we ' re out of chocolate birds .
birds ?
birds .
well , then we' il need to make some more .
here .
now open .
the man was a genius .
did you know he invented a new way of making chocolate ice cream ... ... so that it stays cold for hours without a freezer ?
you can even leave it lying in the sun on a hot day , and it won' t go runny .
but that' s impossible .
but willy wonka did it .
before long ... ... he decided to build a proper chocolate factory .
the largest chocolate factory in history .
fifty times as big as any other .
grandpa , don' t make it gross .
tell him about the lndian prince .
he' d like to hear about that .
you mean , prince pondicherry ?
well , prince pondicherry wrote a letter to mr. wonka ... ... and asked him to come all the way out to lndia ... ... and build him a colossal palace entirely out of chocolate .
it will have 1 00 rooms , and everything will be made of either dark or light chocolate .
true to his word , the bricks were chocolate ... ... and the cement holding them together was chocolate .
all the walls and ceilings were made of chocolate as well .
so were the carpets and the pictures and the furniture .
it is perfect in every way .
yeah , but it won' t last long .
you better start eating right now .
oh , nonsense .
i will not eat my palace .
i intend to live in it .
but mr. wonka was right , of course .
soon after this , there came a very hot day with a boiling sun .
the prince sent an urgent telegram requesting a new palace ... ... but willy wonka was facing problems of his own .
all the other chocolate makers , you see , had grown jealous of mr. wonka .
they began sending in spies to steal his secret recipes .
fickelgruber started making an ice cream that would never melt .
prodnose came out with a chewing gum that never lost its flavor .
then slugworth began making candy balloons ... ... that you could blow up to incredible sizes .
the thievery got so bad ... ... that one day , without warning ... ... mr. wonka told every single one of his workers to go home .
he announced that he was closing his chocolate factory forever .
i' m closing my chocolate factory forever .
i' m sorry .
but it didn' t close forever .
it' s open right now .
yes , well , sometimes when grownups say " forever , " they mean " a very long time .
such as , " i feel like i' ve eaten nothing but cabbage soup forever .
now , pops .
the factory did close , charlie .
and it seemed like it was going to be closed forever .
then one day we saw smoke rising from the chimneys .
the factory was back in business .
did you get your job back ?
no .
no one did .
but there must be people working there .
think about it , charlie .
have you ever seen a single person ... ... going into that factory or coming out of it ?
no .
the gates are always closed .
exactly .
but then , who' s running the machines ?
nobody knows , charlie .
it certainly is a mystery .
hasn' t someone asked mr. wonka ?
nobody sees him anymore .
he never comes out .
the only thing that comes out of that place is the candy ... ... already packed and addressed .
i' d give anything in the world just to go in one more time ... ... and see what' s become of that amazing factory .
well , you won' t , because you can' t .
no one can .
it' s a mystery , and it will always be a mystery .
that little factory of yours , charlie , is as close as any of us is ever going to get .
come on , charlie .
i think it' s time we let your grandparents get some sleep .
good night , grandpa george .
night , charlie .
night night .
chair .
thank you , dear .
night , grandpa joe .
good night , grandma georgina .
nothing' s impossible , charlie .
good night .
night , charlie .
sleep well .
indeed , that very night , the impossible had already been set in motion .
dear people of the world ... ... i , willy wonka ... ... have decided to allow five children to visit my factory this year .
in addition , one of these children shall receive a special prize ... ... beyond anything you could ever imagine .
five golden tickets have been hidden ... ... underneath the ordinary wrapping paper of five ordinary wonka bars .
the bars may be anywhere ... ... in any shop , in any street , in any town , in any country in the world .
wouldn' t it be something , charlie , to open a bar of candy ... ... and find a golden ticket inside ?
i know , but i only get one bar a year , for my birthday .
well , it' s your birthday next week .
you have as much chance as anybody does .
balderdash .
the kids who are going to find the golden tickets ... ... are the ones who can afford to buy candy bars every day .
our charlie gets only one a year .
he doesn' t have a chance .
everyone has a chance , charlie .
mark my words , the kid who finds the first ticket ... ... will be fat , fat , fat .
augustus .
this way .
i am eating the wonka bar ... ... and i taste something that is not chocolate ... ... or coconut ... ... or walnut or peanut butter ... ... or nougat ... ... or butter brittle or caramel or sprinkles .
so i look ... ... and i find the golden ticket .
augustus , how did you celebrate ?
i eat more candy .
we knew augustus would find the golden ticket .
he eats so many candy bars a day ... ... that it was not possible for him not to find one .
yes , it is good , augustus . golden ticket claimed and four more ....
told you it' d be a porker .
what a repulsive boy .
only four golden tickets left .
now that they' ve found one , things will really get crazy . of every shape , size and hue .
veruca .
can you spell that for us , please ?
v e r u c a. veruca salt .
as soon as my little veruca told me she had to have one of these golden tickets ... ... i started buying all the wonka bars i could lay my hands on .
thousands of them .
hundreds of thousands .
i' m in the nut business , you see .
morning , ladies .
from now on , you can stop shelling peanuts ... ... and start shelling the wrappers off these chocolate bars instead .
three days went by , and we had no luck .
oh , it was terrible .
my veruca got more and more upset each day .
where' s my golden ticket ?
i want my golden ticket .
well , gentlemen , i just hated to see my little girl feeling unhappy like that .
i vowed i would keep searching until i could give her what she wanted .
and finally , i found her a ticket .
daddy , i want another pony .
she' s even worse than the fat boy .
i don' t think that was really fair .
she didn' t find the ticket herself .
don' t worry about it , charlie .
that man spoils his daughter .
and no good ever comes from spoiling a child like that .
charlie , mum and i thought ... ... maybe you wanna open your birthday present tonight .
here you are .
maybe i should wait till morning .
like hell .
pop .
all together , we' re 381 years old .
we don' t wait .
now , charlie , you mustn' t feel too disappointed ... ... you know , if you don' t get the ....
whatever happens , you' il still have the candy .
ah , well .
that' s that .
we' il share it .
oh , no , charlie .
not your birthday present .
it' s my candy bar , and i' il do what i want with it .
thank you , darling .
thank you , charlie .
bless you .
all right , let' s see who found it .
the third ticket was found by miss violet beauregarde .
these are just some of the 263 trophies and medals my violet has won .
i' m a gum chewer mostly , but when i heard about these ticket things ... ... i laid off the gum , switched to candy bars .
she' s just a driven young woman .
i don' t know where she gets it .
i' m the junior world champion gum chewer .
this piece of gum i' m chewing right now ... ... i' ve been working on for three months solid .
that' s a record .
of course , i did have my share of trophies , mostly baton .
so it says that one kid' s gonna get this special prize , better than all the rest .
i don' t care who those other four are .
that kid , it' s gonna be me .
tell them why , violet .
because i' m a winner .
what a beastly girl .
despicable .
you don' t know what we' re talking about .
dragonflies ?
but wait , this is just in .
the fourth golden ticket has been found by a boy called mike teavee .
all you had to do was track the manufacturing dates ... ... offset by weather and the derivative of the nikkei lndex .
a retard could figure it out .
most of the time i don' t know what he' s talking about .
you know , kids these days , what with all the technology ....
die !
die !
die !
doesn' t seem like they stay kids very long .
in the end , i only had to buy one candy bar .
and how did it taste ?
i don' t know .
i hate chocolate .
well , it' s a good thing you' re going to a chocolate factory , you ungrateful little
that question is , who will be the winner of the last gold ?
dad ?
yes , charlie ?
why aren' t you at work ?
oh , well , the toothpaste factory thought they' d give me a bit of time off .
like summer vacation ?
sure .
something like that .
in fact , it wasn ' t like a vacation at all .
the upswing in candy sales had led to a rise in cavities ... ... which led to a rise in toothpaste sales .
with the extra money , the factory had decided to modernize ... ... eliminating mr. bucket' s job .
we were barely making ends meet as it was .
you ' ll find another job .
until then , i' il just well , i' il just thin down the soup a little more .
don' t worry , mr. bucket , our luck will change .
i know it .
charlie .
my secret hoard .
you and i are going to have one more fling ... ... at finding that last ticket .
you sure you want to spend your money on that ?
of course i' m sure .
here .
run down to the nearest store ... ... and buy the first wonka candy bar you see .
bring it straight back , and we' il open it together .
such a good boy , really .
such a good ....
grandpa ?
you fell asleep .
have you got it ?
which end should we open first ?
just do it quick , like a band aid .
did you see that some kid in russia found the last golden ticket ?
yes , it was in the paper this morning .
good boy .
come on , george .
good boy .
one wonka whipple scrumptious fudgemallow delight , please .
okay .
here you go .
the nerve of some people .
i know .
forging a ticket .
come on .
it' s a golden ticket .
you found wonka' s last golden ticket .
in my shop too !
listen .
i' il buy it from you .
i' il give you $50 and a new bicycle .
are you crazy ?
i' d give him $500 for that ticket .
you wanna sell me your ticket for $500 , young man ?
that' s enough of that .
leave the kid alone .
listen .
don' t let anyone have it .
take it straight home , you understand ?
thank you .
mom !
dad !
i found it !
the last golden ticket !
it' s mine !
here .
read it aloud .
let' s hear exactly what it says .
greetings to you , the lucky finder of this golden ticket , from mr. willy wonka .
i shake you warmly by the hand .
for now , i do invite you to come to my factory ... ... and be my guest for one whole day .
i , willy wonka , will conduct you around the factory myself ... ... showing you everything there is to see .
afterwards , when it is time to leave ... ... you will be escorted home by a procession of large trucks ... ... each one filled with all the chocolate you could ever eat .
and remember , one of you lucky five children will receive an extra prize ... ... beyond your wildest imagination .
now , here are your instructions .
on the 1 st of february , you must come to the factory gates at 1 0 a . m . sharp .
you' re allowed to bring one member of your family to look after you .
until then , willy wonka .
the 1 st of february .
but that' s tomorrow .
then there' s not a moment to lose .
wash your face , comb your hair , scrub your hands , brush your teeth , blow your nose .
and get that mud off your pants .
now we must all try and keep very calm .
who is going with charlie to the factory ?
i will .
i' il take him .
you leave it to me .
how about you , dear ?
don' t you think you ought to go ?
well , grandpa joe seems to know more about it than we do , and ....
provided , of course , he feels well enough .
no .
we' re not going .
a woman offered me $500 for the ticket .
i bet someone else would pay more .
we need the money more than we need the chocolate .
young man , come here .
there' s plenty of money out there .
they print more every day .
but this ticket ... ... there' s only five of them in the whole world ... ... and that' s all there' s ever going to be .
only a dummy would give this up for something as common as money .
are you a dummy ?
no , sir .
then get that mud off your pants .
you' ve got a factory to go to .
daddy , i want to go in .
it' s 9 : 59 , sweetheart .
make time go faster .
do you think mr. wonka will recognize you ?
hard to say .
it' s been years .
eyes on the prize , violet .
eyes on the prize .
please enter .
come forward .
close the gates .
dear visitors ... ... it is my great pleasure to welcome you to my humble factory .
and who am i ?
well ....
willy wonka , willy wonka
the amazing chocolatier
willy wonka , willy wonka
everybody give a cheer !
hooray !
he' s modest , clever and so smart
he barely can restrain it
with so much generosity
there is no way to contain it !
to contain it to contain , to contain , to contain !
hooray !
willy wonka , willy wonka
he' s the one that you' re about to meet
willy wonka , willy wonka
he' s the genius who just can ' t be beat
the magician and the chocolate wiz
the best darn guy who ever lived
willy wonka , here he is !
the amazing chocolatier
wasn' t that just magnificent ?
i was worried it was getting a little dodgy in the middle part , but then that finale ....
who are you ?
he' s willy wonka .
really ?
good morning , starshine .
the earth says hello .
dear guests , greetings .
welcome to the factory .
i shake you warmly by the hand .
my name is willy wonka .
then shouldn' t you be up there ?
i couldn' t very well watch the show from up there , now , could i , little girl ?
mr. wonka , i don' t know if you' il remember me ... ... but i used to work here in the factory .
were you one of those despicable spies who tried to steal ... ... my life' s work and sell it to parasitic , copycat , candy making cads ?
no , sir .
then wonderful .
welcome back .
let' s get a move on , kids .
don' t you want to know our names ?
can' t imagine how it would matter .
come quickly .
far too much to see .
just drop your coats anywhere .
mr. wonka ?
sure is toasty in here .
what ?
i have to keep it warm in here .
my workers are used to an extremely hot climate .
they just can' t stand the cold .
who are the workers ?
all in good time .
now ....
mr. wonka , i' m violet beauregarde .
i don' t care .
well , you should care .
because i' m gonna win the special prize at the end .
well , you do seem confident , and confidence is key .
i' m veruca salt .
it' s very nice to meet you , sir .
i always thought a verruca was a type of wart ... ... you got on the bottom of your foot .
i am augustus gloop .
i love your chocolate .
i can see that .
so do l .
i never expected to have so much in common .
you .
you' re mike teavee .
you' re the little devil who cracked the system .
and you .
well , you' re just lucky to be here , aren' t you ?
and the rest of you must be their
parents .
yeah .
moms and dads .
dad ?
papa ?
okay , then .
let' s move along .
would you like some chocolate ?
sure .
then you should' ve brought some .
let' s be friends .
best friends .
an important room , this .
after all , it is a chocolate factory .
then why is the door so small ?
that' s to keep all the great big chocolatey flavor inside .
now , do be careful , my dear children .
don' t lose your heads .
don' t get overexcited .
just keep very calm .
it' s beautiful .
what ?
oh , yeah , it' s very beautiful .
every drop of the river ... ... is hot , melted chocolate of the finest quality .
the waterfall is most important .
mixes the chocolate .
churns it up .
makes it light and frothy .
by the way ... ... no other factory in the world mixes its chocolate by waterfall , my dear children .
and you can take that to the bank .
people .
those pipes ... ... suck up the chocolate and carry it away all over the factory .
thousands of gallons an hour .
yeah .
and do you like my meadow ?
try some of my grass .
please have a blade .
please do .
it' s so delectable and so darn good looking .
you can eat the grass ?
of course you can .
everything in this room is eatable .
even i' m eatable .
but that is called cannibalism , my dear children ... ... and is , in fact , frowned upon in most societies .
yeah .
enjoy .
go on .
scoot , scoot .
son .
please .
dad , he said , " enjoy .
why hold on to it ?
why not start a new piece ?
because then i wouldn' t be a champion .
i' d be a loser , like you .
daddy , look over there .
what is it ?
it' s a little person .
over there , by the waterfall .
there' s two of them .
there' s more than two .
where do they come from ?
who are they ?
are they real people ?
of course they' re real people .
they' re oompa loompas .
oompa loompas ?
lmported , direct from loompaland .
there' s no such place .
what ?
mr. wonka , i teach high school geography , and i' m here to tell you
well , then you' il know all about it , and , oh , what a terrible country it is .
the whole place is nothing but thick jungles ... ... infested by the most dangerous beasts in the entire world .
hornswogglers and snozzwangers and those terrible , wicked whangdoodles .
i went to loompaland looking for exotic new flavors for candy .
instead ... ... i found the oompa loompas .
they lived in tree houses to escape from the fierce creatures who lived below .
the oompa loompas ate nothing but green caterpillars , which tasted revolting .
red beetles , the bark of the bong bong tree .
all of them beastly ... ... but not quite so beastly as the caterpillars .
but the food they longed for the most was the cocoa bean .
an oompa loompa was lucky if he found three or four cocoa beans a year .
but , oh , how they craved them .
all they' d ever think about was cocoa beans .
they are such wonderful workers .
i feel i must warn you , though , they are rather mischievous .
always making jokes .
augustus , my child , that is not a good thing you do !
hey , little boy .
my chocolate must be untouched by human hands .
he' il drown .
he can' t swim .
save him !
augustus !
no !
augustus !
augustus , watch out !
there he goes .
call the fire brigade !
it' s a wonder how that pipe is big enough .
it isn' t big enough .
he' s slowing down .
he' s gonna stick .
i think he has .
he' s blocked the whole pipe .
look .
the oompa loompas .
what are they doing ?
they' re going to treat us to a little song .
it is quite a special occasion .
they haven' t had a fresh audience in many a moon .
augustus gloop , augustus gloop
the great big , greedy nincompoop
augustus gloop , so big and vile so greedy , foul and infantile
come on ! " we cried " the time is ripe
to send him shooting up the pipe !
but don ' t , dear children , be alarmed
augustus gloop will not be harmed
augustus gloop will not be harmed
although , of course , we must admit
he will be altered quite a bit
slowly , wheels go round and round
and cogs begin to grind and pound
this greedy brute , this louse' s ear
is loved by people everywhere
for who could hate or bear a grudge
against a luscious bit of fudge ?
bravo !
well done !
aren' t they delightful ?
aren' t they charming ?
i do say , that all seemed rather rehearsed .
like they knew it was gonna happen .
oh , poppycock .
where is my son ?
where does that pipe go to ?
that pipe , it just so happens to lead ... ... directly to the room where i make delicious ... ... strawberry flavored , chocolate coated fudge .
then he will be made into strawberry flavored , chocolate coated fudge .
they' il be selling him by the pound all over the world ?
no .
i wouldn' t allow it .
the taste would be terrible .
can you imagine augustus flavored , chocolate coated gloop ?
no one would buy it .
i want you to take mrs. gloop up to the fudge room , okay ?
help her find her son .
take a long stick and start poking around in the big chocolate mixing barrel , okay ?
mr. wonka ?
why would augustus ' name already be in the oompa loompa song , unless ?
improvisation is a parlor trick .
anyone can do it .
you , little girl .
say something .
anything .
chewing gum .
chewing gum is really gross chewing gum , i hate the most
see ?
exactly the same .
no , it isn' t .
you really shouldn' t mumble .
because i can' t understand a word you' re saying .
now , on with the tour .
are the oompa loompas really joking ?
of course they' re joking .
that boy will be fine .
what' s so funny ?
i think it' s from all those doggone cocoa beans .
hey , by the way , did you guys know that chocolate contains a property ... ... that triggers the release of endorphins ?
gives one the feeling of being in love .
you don' t say .
all aboard .
onward !
here .
try some of this .
it' il do you good .
you look starved to death .
it' s great .
that' s because it' s mixed by waterfall .
the waterfall is most important .
mixes the chocolate , churns it up , makes it light and frothy .
by the way , no other factory in the world  you already said that .
you' re all quite short , aren' t you ?
well , yeah .
we' re children .
well , that' s no excuse .
i was never as short as you .
you were once .
was not .
know why ?
because i distinctly remember putting a hat on top of my head .
look at your short , little arms .
you could never reach .
do you even remember what it was like being a kid ?
oh , boy , do l .
do l ?
in fact , willy wonka hadn ' t thought about his childhood for years .
trick or treat !
trick or treat !
trick or treat !
who do we have here ?
ruthie , veronica , terrance .
and who' s that under the sheet ?
little willy wonka .
willy wonka was the son of the city' s most famous dentist ... ...
wilbur wonka .
now ... ... iet' s see what the damage is this year , shall we ?
caramels .
they' d get stuck in your braces , wouldn' t they ?
lollipops .
ought to be called " cavities on a stick .
then we have all this ....
all this ... ... chocolate .
