i called a phone sex line before i met you ... ... and four blond brothers came after me ... ... and they hurt you , and i' m sorry .
then i had to leave again because i wanted to make sure ... ... you never got hurt again .
and i have a lot of pudding ... ... and in six to eight weeks , it can be redeemed .
so if you could just give me that much time ... ... i think i can get enough mileage to go with you wherever you go ... ... if you have to travel for your work .
because i don' t ever want to be anywhere without you .
so could you just let me redeem the mileage ?
you left me at the hospital .
i' m sorry .
you can' t do that .
if you just give me six to eight weeks ... ... i can redeem the mileage ... ... and i can go with you wherever you have to travel .
so here we go .
