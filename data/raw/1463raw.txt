your first visit alone .
just make sure she has what she needs , and help out around the house .
it' s yoko' s case , but she didn' t show up for work this morning .

she must be sick or something .

what' s this phrase ?
that' s " severe lethargy with mild dementia .
apparently , she sleeps through most of the day .
her daughter in law doesn' t work , so she' il probably be there .

we found this in the hallway .
this is him .

detective nakagawa ?
the whole time i was in that house ...
i felt something was wrong .
what happened there ?
the bodies of the son and daughter in law ... of the woman you were caring for were found in the attic .
it seems that the son killed his wife , and then himself .
please excuse me for a moment .
what are you doing here ?
i thought they weren' t gonna let you go until tonight .
did you escape ?
i just had to get out of there .
i didn' t wanna be alone .

my name is karen davis .
i' m really sorry to bother you .
i was wondering if i could ask you a few questions .

i need to ask you a few questions about your husband .

thanks .
hi .
detective nakagawa , i need to speak with you .
the woman who was murdered in that house three years ago knew this man .
he committed suicide the morning after she died .
i don' t believe he killed himself .
i don' t understand .
what' s happening ?
three years ago ... three of my colleagues , my friends ... began investigating a case .
two died mysteriously , and one disappeared .
they had been investigating the murders at that house .
are you saying the detectives died because of that house ?
i' ve been in that house .
so have you !
it is said in japan ... that when a person dies in extreme sorrow or rage ... the emotion remains ... becoming a stain upon that place .
the memory of what happened repeats itself there .
death becomes a part of that place ... killing everything it touches .
once you have become a part of it ... it will never let you go .
i' m sorry .
