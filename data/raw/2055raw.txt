so , all in all , it wasn' t a bad first day .

no , he' s a douche bag .
he' il tind somebody else to pick on .
they kicked him out , you know .
good .
they kick moochie out ?
probation .
those assholes .
stop the car !
quick !
go back !
what' s the matter ?
i want to look at her !
all right , arnie .
just go back .
all right ?
jesus christ .
what is it ?
do you know someone who lives here ?
what ?
jesus .
be careful , dennis .
this is a piece of shit .
she could be fixed up .
yeah .
oh , she could be really tough .
forget it .
this baby' s got 93, 000 miles on it .
probably 193 .
i don' t care .
i bet it won' t even start .
she' il start .
you need these .
how much do you want for her ?
whatever it is , it' s not enough .
jesus , arnie .
sonny , you ever owned a car before ?
yeah , he owns a mustang  no .
i just got my license .
name' s george lebay .
arnie cunningham .
what are you asking ?
start her up .
really ?
her name' s christine .
i like that .
come on .
we gotta get going .
my asshole brother bought her in september , ' 57 .
you got your new model year in september .
brand new , she was .
she had the smell of a brand new car .
about the finest smell in the world , except maybe for pussy .
when he got her , she had six miles on the odometer .
goddamn roland went through hell and back with christine .
if your brother loves this car so much , why is he selling it ?
' cause he' s stone cold dead .
died six weeks ago .
so , mr. lebay ... how much do you want for her ?
i' ve been asking 300 .
i' il make it 250 tor you .
250 ?
this isn' t worth 50 bucks .
the money' s not important , and there' il be no bringing her back ...
' cause i' m selling this shit hole and buying me a condo .
you got a deal .
i' il get the pink slip .
will you stop and think about this tor a moment ?
where are you getting the money ?
i' ve been saving all summer .
for college .
you already have a car .
he' s screwing you .
you could get a decent car for that much money .
christine is decent .
the guy' s weird , arnie .
he' s fucking weird .
so that was 300 ?
yeah , that' s it .
you said 250 .
250 would do it .
it this is a good idea , let' s just come back tomorrow .
do you realize she' s 20 years old ?
i mean , that makes her officially an antique .
great .
darnell' s junkyard is full of official antiques .
i' m buying her .
i don' t care what you say .
it' s your funeral , man .
would you give arnie a break ?
he doesn' t know what he' s doing .
you don' t know half as much as you think you do ... shitter .
you did what ?
she' s outside .
you' re kidding , right ?
you can' t buy a car .
what are you talking about ?
you' re 17 years old .
oh , boy .
actually , you' re wrong .
i couldn' t finance it , but buying it for cash is no problem .
registering a car at 17 is something else ... and for that i need your permission .
you know how we do things .
you could' ve consulted with us .
i' ve consulted with you about every damn thing i' ve ever done .
if it' s something i want , i get outvoted , two to one !
this is no committee meeting .
i bought the car , and that' s it !
it most certainly is not it !
how could you have let him do this ?
i didn' t let him .
he wanted the car , and he bought it .
i tried to talk him out ot it .
i doubt you tried very hard .
yeah , well , i' m going home .
i think you should .
that' s it .
i' m getting the fuck out of here .
what kind of lang  what did you say !
you wanted me in college courses .
i' m there .
you wanted chess club instead of band .
i' m there too .
i' ve managed 17 years without embarrassing you or landing in jail .
i' m gonna have this one thing !
you are not keeping any car at this house .
fine !
thanks for the milk .
what' s the problem ?
could you honk your horn for me ?
christine' s doesn' t seem to work .
ah .
sure .
thanks .
stall 20 .
get it over there and shut it off ... before we all choke to death .
kiddo , if you sold him that piece of shit , you ought to be fuckin ' ashamed .
i didn' t sell it to him .
i tried to talk him out of it .
you should have tried harder .
i knew a guy who had a car like that once .
fuckin ' bastard killed himself in it .
son of a bitch was so mean ... if you poured boiling water down his throat ... he would have pissed ice cubes .
okay .
that' s the last time ... you run that mechanical asshole in here without an exhaust hose .
i catch you doin ' it one time , and you' re out .
you understand ?
huh ?
yes .
i' m gonna tell you something else right now .
i don' t take any shit trom you kids .
this place is for working stiffs , gotta keep their cars runnin ' .
it' s not for rich assed , snot nosed kids draggin ' on the orange belt .
i don' t allow no smoking in here neither .
you go out in the junkyard .
i don' t smoke .
don' t interrupt me , punk .
don' t interrupt me .
don' t get smart .
ah , sir ?
what ?
those men over there are smoking .
better tell them to stop .
you trying to help your buddy right out of here , chuck ?
then shut your pie hole .
i know a creep when i see one .
i think i' m looking at one right now .
you' re on probation .
you get it ?
you screw around with me ...
i don' t care how much money you paid up in front ...
i' il throw you out on your ass !
you got it ?
huh ?
yes , sir .
good .
now get the hell out of here .
we' re closed .
you gonna be okay ?
yeah .
i' m okay .
you know , you better find yourself some other charity besides me and christine .
what is it about that car ?
i don' t know .
maybe it' s just that for the first time i' ve found something uglier than me .
and i know i can fix her up .
you' re not ugly , arnie .
i know what i am .
queer , maybe , but not ugly .
fuck you .
oh , bug out , dennis .
you don' t need this shit .
where have you been ?
you had us worried sick !
you don' t just up and drive off whenever you
as i walk along i wonder
what went wrong with our love
a love that was so strong
he' s done all this shit in three weeks .
look how cockeyed he works .
he' s got tuckin ' brand new windshield wipers ... for a busted windshield .
well , the boy does have good hands .
good hands .
bad taste in cars .
you know , papa , you can' t polish a turd .
when i said you could scrounge through that shit pile out back ...
i didn' t mean you could build your whole fuckin ' car with my stuff .
what do you care ?
you' re not doing anything with it .
hey !
don' t think you got the gold key to the crapper .
nobody takes advantage of me , understand ?
yeah .
if it wasn' t for me , it' d cost you a shit pile to put this heap together .
i know .
look .
i know you ain' t got money falling out of your asshole .
if you did , you wouldn' t be here .
maybe we could work out some kind of a deal .
you ... pick up around the place .
do a few lubes ... put the toilet paper on the little spools ... shit like that .
do that and you can you can raid my junk pile for whatever you want .
i might even throw in a few bucks .
i' il have to think about it .
well , don' t think about it too long !
i' il throw you out on your fuckin ' ass .
forever , my darling
my love will be true
always and forever
i' il love just you
just promise me , darling
your love in return
may this fire in my soul , dear
forever burn
my heart' s at your command , dear
i' il bet you a dollar she says no .
just ' cause she shot you down ?
she says no to everybody .
look what she' s doing to that pencil .
i wish i was an eraser .
go on , studley .
ask her out .
mind your own business .
just read the book .
yeah .
come on .
just don' t tip the table over .
what are you reading ?
history .
oh .
it' s pretty boring , huh ?
yeah .
listen , do you like music ?
what about dancing ?
yes .
do you think you might ... want to go dancing with me ...
iike maybe this friday night after the game ?
i' m sorry .
i can' t .
why not ?
i have a date .
mr. gilder !
are you lost ?
no , ma' am .
why don' t you return to your own seat and get back to work .
yeah .
arnie , stay here so we can talk this over .
mister , this is not a hotel you can just drop into .
i don' t need this .
what do you need ?
i need to leave .
i' m late .
you come back here this instant .
oh , shit .
greetings to you too .
hey , man , no glasses .
you' re lookin ' good .
i can' t make it .
i meant to call you , but i forgot .
is dennis going with you ?
are you going with him ?
am i ?
no .
i' ve gotta do an errand for darnell .
you need a ride ?
got his car .
thanks , though .
i' m sorry about the movie , but this is work .
gotta go .
don' t worry about it .
did you have plans with dennis ?
you are going to have no friends at all if you keep treating people this way .
get off my back !
you' re his best friend .
what' s going on ?
i don' t know .
i hardly see him anymore .
neither do we .
ever since he bought that car he' s been obsessed with it .
and you know what else ?
when we signed the registration papers at town hall ... they told us the man who owned that car last ... died in it of carbon monoxide poisoning .
jesus .
does arnie know about that ?
arnie doesn' t know anything anymore .
what the hell do you want ?
i know about your brother .
i know he died choking on exhaust fumes .
you don' t know shit , kid .
my brother died ' cause he wanted to .
he ran a rubber hose from the exhaust pipe .
arnie wouldn' t have bought it if he' d known somebody died in it .
either you' re dumb or you don' t know your friend very well .
he had the same look my brother always had .
probably the only thing my brother ever loved in his life was that car .
no shitter ever came between him and christine .
if they did , watch out .
his five year old daughter choked to death in it .
he wouldn' t get rid of it .
he rode around without a care in the world except for christine .
only time i ever interfered was when rita killed herself .
who' s rita ?
his wife !
he didn' t care a rat' s ass about her .
she died the same way he did .
then i made him get rid of it .
for decency , you know .
of course , the car came back three weeks later .
what do you mean , " came back " ?
keep a knockin ' , but you can' t come in
come back tomorrow night and try it again
you said you loved me and you can' t come in
you said you loved me
all right .
fifty .
pass on go .
ready ?
want me to go deep or flat ?
flat .
i' il hit you on the second shot comin ' around .
hey , trelawney .
is that cuntingham' s car ?
yep .
i know where he keeps it .
down ... set , go !
fucking shit !
get a stretcher !
come on !
5, 000 dirty limericks .
ought to keep you busy for a while .
this is the third time i' ve come by .
must be dynamite drugs .
you' re always asleep .
doesn' t quite kill the pain .
rockbridge hasn' t won a game since you got hurt .
that makes you a hero , right ?
did i tell you that i' m not gonna be playing football again ?
ever .
the doctor said that one centimeter more ... and i would have been paralyzed trom the waist down .
shitters did some job on you , huh ?
so what' s this about you and leigh cabot ?
we like each other okay .
ho ho .
listen to mr. cool .
she just happens to be the most beautiful girl in the school .
well , it' s not what you think .
i really ... respect her mind .
she lusts after my body .
what can i say ?
fuck you .
i saw you guys at the football game .
how' d you ever get that car tixed up like that ?
oh , just plain old fashioned hard work .
i still can' t keep her at home .
mom says it makes the yard look crowded .
i' m surprised they let you register it .
i told them it they didn' t , i' d drop school .
are you serious ?
they just don' t want me to grow up because they' d have to face getting old .
has it ever occurred to you ... that part of being a parent ... is trying to kill your kids ?
see you around , pal .
i' m sorry , arnie .
i can' t .
what' s the matter ?
what' s wrong ?
i can' t .
here .
in that car .
what are you talking about ?
why not ?
' cause i hate that car .
you care more about that car than me .
that' s crazy , leigh .
who do you spend more time with ?
look you' re gonna get a cold .
come on .
i thought girls are supposed to be jealous of other girls , not cars .
this car' s a girl .
oh , please .
cut it out .
don' t .
what ?
you don' t like me slapping your girl ?
it seems like nobody likes my car these days .
oh , shit !
you' re mine
and we belong
together
yes , we belong together
yes , it belongs to only me
what the hell are you doing ?
get your goddamn hands off her !
whoa , whoa !
hey !
you gonna be all right ?
yeah , i' m fine now .
you scared the hell out of me .
then get rid of that car .
i' m not going in it again .
wait a minute .
don' t you blame your choking on christine .
it happened , arnie .
when i choked , something happened .
the radio came on .
everything got bright .
so , what are you saying ?
i could' ve died , and you couldn' t even help .
my door was locked .
you didn' t want that man to help me either !
i thought he was attacking you !
i could have done the heimlich maneuver .
but you didn' t .
there are other things .
that radio .
all it gets is those old songs .
sometimes when we' re making out ... it just stalls .
as if the car were jealous , arnie .
a goddamn car !
i' il get it .
know what i think ?
i think you' re just sexually frustrated .
i' m sorry , okay ?
can i at least call you tomorrow ?
i don' t know .
come on .
come on , baby , please .
it' s all right .
everything is the same .
i love you like i do
don' t know why i love you
don' t know why i care
i wonder why i love you like i do
is it because
i know you love me too
check this out !
keep a knockin ' , but you can' t come in
i' il just be a second .
i just have to get my wallet out of christine .
want to come in with me ?
please .
you know , i' ve been thinking .
maybe we should apply to the same colleges next year .
really ?
yeah .
if we get accepted by the same schools ... we could take it as a sign of fate .
you' d have me to help you through math , and if
arnie , what' s wrong ?
who did this ?
don' t touch me , shitter !
this is just what you wanted !
you get away from her !
arnie , i' m sorry .
sorry ?
yes .
i that is , we
it' s your fault .
if you hadn' t been so damn selfish that you wouldn' t let me park my own car ... in your precious driveway , this never would have happened .
that' s not fair .
oh , it' s tair .
can' t we even talk about this ...
iike rational human beings ?
one of them took a shit on the dashboard of my car , ma .
how' s that for rational , huh ?
why don' t we
your mother and i have decided to help you buy a new car .
well , that' s what everybody wants , isn' t it ?
well , fuck you .

how' s christine coming ?
oh , cherry .
i spent a shitload ot money on her , and she' s perfecto now .
that' s funny , you know , ' cause ...
i heard she was totaled .
after i cleaned up the broken glass , it wasn' t so bad .
i bet you a hundred bucks ... it was buddy repperton .
maybe .
so what if you fix it up and he just comes back and does it again ?
he won' t do it again .
what does that mean ?
man , i gotta go .
i hope you didn' t think i could hang around here all day .
yeah , that' s you , arnie , always in demand .
stay loose .
you know it .
happy thanksgiving .
lean machine .
they let you out early ?
yeah , that' s right .
i' m rudolph junkins , state police , detective .
i' m just missing a study hall .
i got to get to work .
i don' t care about that .
i want to ask you about your car .
you do nice body work .
i thought this thing was totaled .
who told you that ?
why , hell , everybody .
local police , your mom and dad , your girl .
cute girl , by the way .
it wasn' t as bad as it looked .
the report said they punched holes in the body .

i' ve been lucky with parts .
i replaced the entire door on this side .
yeah ?

wait .
they didn' t really trash it .
that' s not what leigh said .
she was so shaken up , giving me all the details ... she broke down crying .
i understand ... one ot the perpetrators defecated on the dashboard .
i would' ve thought you' d be madder than hell at that ... and i would' ve thought you would' ve reported that .

down there .
yeah .
you better get started .
yeah !

let' s try it .
christine' s gonna come through the door .
you better get in the office and stay out of sight .
once she gets inside , hit the button and bring the door down .
then we' il have her trapped .
what if he doesn' t come ?
christine will .
you better get in the office .
keep your head down .
when you hear me start this thing up , that' s when you hit the button .
leigh , don' t move !
stay where you are !
