he was brought in at 09 : 00 and they figured he was responsible for setting off a nuke on u. s. soil .
norad picked up a hotspot in the alaskan mountains just outside of fairbanks .
they contacted the warship sumanza , stationed in the bearing strait .
commander drew stevens dispatches troops to the area to observe phase one terrorist protocol .
expect the worst .
whatever happened was to be considered an act of war against the united states .
that' s when they called me .
and in the hours that followed
i learned things that were going to change the way we live forever .
don' t move !
there' s somebody at the door .
oh , god ...
you look like shit , son .
why don' t you have a seat , make yourself comfortable ?
want to tell me your name ?
i' ve already told you people .
i' m doctor peter lang .
i need to report to major harrison of charlie squadron delta .
i don' t have much time .
you a military man , lang ?
sort of .
sort of .
that' s funny .
i' ve been in military most of my adult life and i' ve never met a single person who was " sort of " in the military .
you' re either in or you' re out , don' t you think ?
so a pretty straight forward answer i' m looking for here .
so , i' m gonna ask you again .
are you in the military ?
i can' t talk to anybody in this building .
i' m not authorized to .
call harrison , and he' il understand the urgency of the situation .
i got a pretty good handle on the situation .
two hours ago , somebody detonated a nuclear device on u. s. soil and you' re the prime suspect .
that' s either an act of war or that' s terrorism but either way you' re going to answer any question i ask you .
so , why don' t we start this again ?
are you a military man , lang ?
i need to report to harrison , the joint chiefs or the president .
i' m not authorized to talk to you and i won' t .
if you get harrison , you might have a chance to save the world .
save the world .
that sounds like a threat to me .
you keep talking about this harrison ... right ?
we' ve been looking for him since you' ve mentioned his name .
and guess what ?
there is no harrison .
the president and the joint chiefs don' t have the foggiest idea who peter lang is nor do they have any interest in talking to terrorists .
i suggest that you put me at the top of your priority list and do it pretty quick cause things are about to get ugly around here .
why don' t we try this again ?
who do you work for , peter ?
that kind of smarts , doesn' t it ?
most fellows start belleding from the ears , but you took this pretty good .
you don' t look so bad .
i have ... top information , and you' re treating me like a terrorist .
i' m doing that cause this is a matter of national security .
a lot of people out there got a lot of questions and i' ve been given authorization to use whatever means necessary to get answers to those questions .
i suggest you start telling me what you know now or we' re going to go through this over and over again .
i can' t .
i love these things .
400, 000 volts running off two nine volts batteries .
this sort of torture used to be sloppy .
buckets , sponges , big cables .
it just wasn' t safe .
nowadays , i can carry 400, 000 volts in my hip pocket .
pretty effective , wouldn' t you say ?
i can' t tell you what you want to hear .
you have to trust me .
it' s for your own safety .
you' re going to tell me what i want to know .
why don' t we keep is simple , all right ?
tell me how your day started .
hi , honey .
hi , peter .
a phone call would' ve been nice .
you know how i feel about phones .
baby , go wait in your room , ok ?
bye , peter .
see you , kimie .
there' s been an incident in the lab .
is everybody ok ?
we don' t know .
i need to get in .
i need to find out and i need your help .
peter , i ...
an officer will look after kimie .
it won' t be long .
ok .
give me five minutes .
don' t worry .
i' il be back before you know it .
i love you .
i love you too .
bye , mom .
ok .
fill me in .
i will in the truck .
well ... at 2 : 13 , fairbanks hq received some sort of garbled transmission .
a breach of bio containment six .
two minutes later , somebody on the inside initiated a full lock down .
power' s off .
interlock' s sealed .
all communications to the outside world were served from the inside .
look , i ...
i called harrison .
oh , jesus .
it could be any number of things .
chemical , or bio , or nuclear .
whatever it is , we' re gonna need help .
there' re 14 people down there , and the clock is ticking .
you' re right .
we' re going to need harrison .
we' re going to go in with a small combat team .
technical experts .
harrison' s very best .
highest possible clearances , just in case .
ok .
if we have to move in , we move in .
but this team of experts they only the best , right ?
right .
come to me .
don' t even think about it .
i' m on the clock , honey .
don' t you think this is more important than the clock ?
you' re killing me .
sergeant trainer .
dcs tactical briefing in 10 minutes , trainer .
trainer ?
did i catch you at a bad time ?
no , sir .
i' m just about ... to clear my weapon .
we have a situation .
get o' brien .
you' re going in tonight .
affirmative , sir .
we' re going in .
why don' t you get whoever is on the phone to call you back ?
trish ?
daddy ?
i' m toast .
you ...
trainer ?
i' m hall .
communications .
good to meet you , hall .
good to meet you , sir .
you new on the base ?
yes , sir .
first time in alaska ?
first .
i like it though .
it' s cold .
trying to get used to the daylight .
never seems to get dark .
having trouble sleeping , sir .
i' ve been here for two summers and i still can' t get used to it .
and don' t call me " sir " .
yes , sir ...
ok .
what have you heard about this mission ?
we' re being sent there cause you banged the general' s daughter .
jesus christ !
what ?
bad news travels fast .
you know kids .
no .
you see she had her 22nd birthday last week .
whatever you say , sir .
hear anything else ?
it looks that we' re going to be accompanied by major ross and what' s her dick ?
get my volley ?
ross ...
sir ?
i wonder why they' d send a major on a mission like this .
can' t say , sir .
haven' t met the man myself ... but o' brien ... she really drove our regiment into the ground in iraq .
she' s a tough mother for a hole , let me tell you .
that' s what i heard ...
but why would a half decent looking chick like o' brien ... want to be an officer ?
everybody knows any chick that tough has to be a lesbo .
she' s get in the army to get the colonel' s daughter , probably .
sir ...
ma' am !
when you finished bonding , re join the rest of the army .
full mission breaking in two .
yes , ma' am .
sarge ... you need a larger weapon .
welcome to alaska , hall .
thank you , gentlemen .
' ten hut !
all right , people , at ease .
this mission is black .
no medals , no rewards , no lucrative book deals .
our target destination is vectol bio research laboratories ... outside fairbanks , alaska .
although it is a civilian facility , it is under contract to uncle sam ... and my responsibility .
dr. cole ...
captain o' brien , is our best in bio chem ...
sergeant hall , is our communications specialist ...
trainer , weapons and explosives , lastly ...
major ross , our counter terrorism expert .
dr. cole ?
three hours ago , someone at our lab initiated an emergency lock down .
we' ve had no communication since .
there' re 14 researchers trapped down there .
we need to get them out .
only 23 people outside this room know about those labs .
of those 23 only a handful are privy to the work they do .
although this is classified , we' il give you what we can .
dr. cole ?
dr. lang ... head of the bio weapons counter measures at vectol .
vectol labs are located in an abandoned copper mine ... 500 feet below the surface .
it' s been retrofitted as a high tech bio chemical facility .
access is through a single air lock and elevator .
there are four levels : research , weapons , chemical , living quarters .
below that is an emergency air lock .
once you' re in , nothing gets out .
there' s been only one other breach of this facility two years ago .
a lab tech accidentally spilled a thimble full of nerve gas .
a thimble full .
he died ninety seconds later .
it took us three months to clean out that isolation lab .
we are dealing with a full isolation lock down .
trainer ?
why us ?
dr. lang ?
vectol labs do a multitude of sins .
chemical , bio , nuclear toxins .
stuff we have down there makes ebola look like the common cold .
it' s possible terrorists breached the facility .
we need to find out .
don' t we have any other intelligence on this ?
latest satellite re con flight shows all is clear .
perimeter secure .
this is avery sensitive situation .
fewer people envolved , the better , that' s why i' m sending the best .
i' m a scientist , but i' m also a former army captain .
once inside , all of you answer directly to me .
trainer ?
people ?
is that clear ?
yes , sir .
yes , sir .
good .
these are not your standard suits .
they' re made from kevlar purine fiber .
think of them as a2nd skin .
your atmosphere gauge is at the wrist .
green is for good air , yellow for questionable ... and if it' s red and you' ve just breathed it , you' ve died .
this is for your oxygen .
you have about one hour' s worth .
what are these syringes for , doctor ?
excuse me .
if one of you become contaminated ... remove the hypodermic from the pouch ... and then plunge it directly in the neck ... as deep as ...
don' t do that . ... as possible .
avoid severing the carotid artery .
i' il do that .
the needle releases a neuro toxin .
it would save your life and get you to treatment as quickly as possible .
and what if we don' t get stuck ?
what happens then ?
that depends on which toxin you' ve been infected with ... but within 10 seconds your throat constricts .
you can' t breath .
your esophagus becomes brittle and it dissolves .
your organs turn to jelly as your molecular structure is collapsing .
but after that , you should mercifully black out .
i get the picture .
have either one of you tried ... this needle ?
yeah .
dr. cole has .
what happened ?
gear up .
we move out in ten .
any other questions ?
dismissed .
i think she likes me , o' brien .
what are you talking about ?
she' s a grown up .
i should try that .
colonel !
major .
permission to speak freely , sir .
go ahead .
i' m not comfortable taking my orders from these scientists .
you take your orders from me .
follow cole and lang to the letter .
yes , sir , but babysitting civilians is ...
cole can take care of herself .
it' s lang i need you to cover .
he works for me .
his project is classified ... has top priority on the pentagon .
cole doesn' t know about it .
she thinks she' s in command .
work with her all the way .
if it' s viral or chemical , she' s in charge .
it it' s terrorist , you take command .
your priority is make sure lang gets his research out .
my team has the highest security clearance .
i need to know what' s going on down there .
this is a matter of national security .
nobody can know about it .
when it comes to biologicals , even the president is expendable .
yes , sir .
lang is the priority .
if i' m a terrorist , what' s my primary target down there ?
there' s enough plutonium in that mountain to satisfy a small army .
terrorists or not , we' re going to find our people okay down there .
just hope my staff are safe .
with this lock down there' s a chance the air' s been contaminated .
keep your helmets on and breathe easy .
and conserve your air as long as possible .
you got that ?
cole ... if we do encounter terrorists , stand down and let my team handle this .
your team ?
your team will do what i say .
this is a chemical lab .
nobody does anything without my approval .
you got that , major ?
trainer , hold up a sec .
i' ve got a bad feeling about this .
you' re just scared .
that' s not what i meant .
chemical weapons , possible terrorists ... small crew , civilian in charge ...
we' re going in there and no one is telling us anything about it .
how many times have you and i been down this road before ?
you watch my back , i' il watch yours all right .
i hate working with civilians .
you wanted delta .
deal with it .
lang .
what ?
the minute you know how to get out of there , you let me know .
i don' t need my team staying in this tunnel any longer than they have to .
i' il recommend immediate e vac as soon as i get what i need .
and , major , our relationship stays confidential .
that' s what i hear .
peter , check the intercom , see if anyone responds .
no , doc , not a good idea .
if they' re terrorists you don' t want to give away our position , right ?
good point .
let' s keep the chatter to a minimum , ok ?
jesus , lang !
will you back the fuck up ?
holster that weapon .
this isn' t right .
what' s your concern , cole ?
the reading .
there' s something in the air but i don' t know what it is .
what' s with this water ?
i have no idea .
i' ve never seen anything like this .
hey , ross .
what have you got ?
looks like a gold tooth .
that' s a little more than unusual .
got some slime all over it .
what' s the slime like ?
is it toxic ?
i don' t think so .
cole , you should take a look at it .
maybe the sprinkler system broke here .
it' s not ho or retardant .
cole ... what do you think ?
major !
hall .
got a number 45 here ... emptied the clip .
what the hell they shooting at ?
no matter , but stay sharp so it doesn' t end up shooting at you .
i found a pacemaker .
it' s still beating .
jesus !
this is creepy .
we need to get to work .
hall , trainer and o' brien ... restore communications and power .
it' s through these doors .
it' s down one level .
keep to the right .
it' s at the end of the hall .
after that , sweep level 3 .
it' s the living quarters .
wait .
you want us to split up ?
ross , what do we do ?
you have your orders .
report if you see anyone .
rcb will be level 2 .
containments labs .
we' il meet there .
how many people we looking for ?
fourteen .
you heard the lady , let' s move out .
i think we should look for the guy with the pacemaker .
just my luck , i' m red shit , baby .
this way .
dr. lang , this isn' t a picnic .
let' s move .
this is worse than we thought .
you recognize it .
it' s got the molecular structure of human dna .
doctors ?
what is this stuff ?
we' re not sure just yet .
major , i wouldn' t stand under there if i were you .
where the hell is everybody ?
i don' t know .
trainer ... ever notice our missions have become a little more hazardous ?
what are you talking about ?
look around you .
we' re in a factory full of biological weapons .
so , what' s that got to do with me ?
she' s jailbait and she' s the colonel' s daughter .
would you put a pipe in it ?
she' s not jailbait , captain .
she looks at least 19 or 10 .
that' s my man , hall .
she ain' t no child .
you' re just jealous , o' brien .
come on , o' brien , who you kidding ?
wouldn' t you take a run at her if you had a chance ?
careful , hall , or i' m going to take a run at you .
want to get you guys a room ?
hall' s not my type , trainer .
he thinks i' m a lesbo .
i' m ok with lesbos .
just kidding .
it' s gone .
what ?
no , that' s impossible .
what' s gone ?
i can' t talk about it with you .
i don' t give a damn about your secret weapons .
i' il tell you what you need to know when you need to know it .
are my people in any danger ?
not more than the rest of us .
that' s not an answer .
give us a moment , major .
one of our experiments has gone missing .
we need to find it .
ross .
copy ?
go ahead , captain .
auxiliary power was up in the lab level only .
the generator doesn' t work .
hall can' t get any more power of it .
good work .
we' ve completed the sweep of the living quarters .
not a soul , sir .
proceed to communications .
try to raise harrison .
and captain ... watch your back .
anything on your end , sir ?
one of the doctor' s experiments has gone missing .
what kind of an experiment ?
they' re both tight lipped .
until i know more , assume we' re still dealing with terrorists .
exercise extreme caution and report back every 10 minutes .
understood .
it' s not just a walk in the park .
not today .
if i can squeeze any more out of them i' il contact you .
roger that .
reporting back in 10 .
in 10 minutes .
missing experiment .
doesn' t sound too good .
not in this place , it ain' t .
stay sharp .
we got a job to do .
what the hell happened here ?
you fix this up , hall ?
raise topside ?
i could raise mars if i had to , but ... it' s probably easier to ... jerry rig the up line and get cell communications working .
this is creepy .
slime covering everything .
like something out of the blob .
holy shit , hall , that' s it .
what ?
the doctor' s experiments is probably just like the blob .
it' s loose and it' s sliming up everything in its path ... devouring everything it can .
you know what ?
we' re dessert .
you' re not funny .
what are you talking about ?
you' re not funny , man .
you see that ?
yeah , right .
let' s focus .
i' m serious .
i saw some guy .
i swear !
hall .
jesus !
you saw someone ?
i think .
hall , raise topside .
let' s go .
are you serious ?
i' m serious .
get in there .
get communications up .
i' il check the door .
all right .
let' s hope the containment lab remains secure .
is it possible somebody moved it ?
it' s possible , but unlikely .
it takes a team of 8 to move it .
if it had been moved , we would have known .
what about the plutonium ?
it is all accounted for , major ... but right now it' s the least of our worries .
the air is clean .
cole , check the computer data .
see if somebody' s moved it .
i' il check bio containment 6 .
major ross , you watch her back .
major ross , external com is up and operating , sir .
good work , trainer .
o' brien , continue to sweep , report if you find anyone .
roger .
i' il continue .
command , alpha team reporting .
this is harrison .
report .
auxiliary power and communications restored , sir .
we have control of the main lab .
still no sign of the staffers .
we do however have a missing experiment .
we' re going to look for it ... ... and any sign of terrorists .
keep me posted .
you did this to me .
stay here .
watch my back .
jesus christ !
is that you , sara ?
what the hell happened ?
it got out .
we didn' t stand a chance .
nobody' s going to be able to stop it .
it' s under my skin , peter .
it' s under my goddamn skin !
sara , no !
look what you' ve done to me .
radiation is the only way to kill it .
what happened ?
i need to kill us all .
for christ' s sakes , don' t do that !
it' s inside me .
i can feel it .
inside me .
i can feel it .
lf you' re gonna kill us all , stop !
no !
please , don' t make me do this .
just stop .
sara , i' m so sorry .
cole , no !
cole , you just executed a civilian .
she was no longer human .
then what was she ?
lang , why didn' t you try to help her ?
she was infected .
infected with what ?
there are infectious agents here .
not good enough , doctor .
the radiation would' ve gone critical .
i did what i had to do .
i want answers .
i need to know now !
what are we up against ?
there are no terrorists , are there ?
we can' t be certain .
i reckon that we leave now .
that' s the first sensible thing either of you have said all day .
we' re not leaving until we figure out the fate of our staff .
you just saw what happened to our staff .
trainer , give me a situation report .
nothing down here but slime , sir .
other than that , all seems clear .
return to the lab .
we' re getting out of here .
if you meet anyone , assume that they' re hostile .
sergeant , keep your suits on at all times .
hostile , sir ?
we just met one of the staffers .
it wasn' t pretty .
she was infected with something .
it' s been secured .
secured , sir ?
permanently .
understood .
meet back at the lab .
report anything suspicious .
copy that .
this whole place is suspicious .
command , this is alpha team .
one second .
harrison .
report .
the situation isn' t good .
we can confirm contamination .
cole , you there ?
yes , sir .
situation ?
the facility has been breached and the pb3 is missing .
colonel ...
i suggest that we brief ross on the intel that we have on pb3 .
our chances of surviving through this mission will be greater .
fill him in my full authorization .
yes , sir .
we first heard about it after chernobyl .
soviets discovered an alien microbe on a meteorite that crashed in siberia in the 10' s .
they called it pb3 to honor the third session of the politburo ... or something like that .
once the microbe was separated it reproduced at an alarming rate .
their scientists attempted to clone it .
no dice .
in the end , it took a 10 megaton nuke and 10, 000 lives to put that genie back in the bottle .
after the wall collapsed , uncle sam took all responsibility and brought it to us .
government hired vectol to study the military potential and applications of pb3 to see how to counter it .
as a liquid , it had this ... intelligence .
it could think , learn .
imagine , a single alien life from the size of a drop of water that we could train to kill whatever we wanted it to .
a drop of water that could survive in any landscape from a nuclear environment to the blood stream of a human body .
what' s the difference between the liquid and pb3 ?
the liquid is what pb3 produces .
the pb3 is actually an alien .
we cloned the microbe' s dna .
are you telling me there' s an alien loose down here ?
jesus !
alien ?
is that so hard to believe ?
i' m getting pretty tired of your bullshit , lang .
you' d better start feeding me something easier to swallow .
sir ?
go ahead , captain .
we' re still coming up blank on harrison but we' ve been able to confirm that ross , o' brien , trainer and hall do in fact exist as members of the charlie squadron delta .
they' re stationed in fairbanks .
their c. o. , major tindal confirms they were requested for a black op at 04 : 00 .
he won' t give up any details of the mission .
he wasn' t cleared for it .
thank you , captain .
it' s an alias .
what are you muttering about ?
harrison would never implicate himself if anything were to go wrong .
we' re down to working on secrets that our government can never admit .
things that could topple our nation' s credibility .
what if north korea knew the kind of warfare we were trying to perfect ?
we' re giving them a hard time with the nuclear program when all the while we' re cloning aliens for military application .
are you telling me that you' re an independent contractor working with the military on cloning aliens ?
you' re not a believer .
you don' t think in this vast universe another life form exists ?
one that' s more versatile , smart , dangerous we know humans to be ?
every year , hundreds of meteorites slam into our planet .
we found a drop of water on one .
you have any idea how many we never find ?
how many other drops of water are out there ?
o' brien , you see that ?
see what ?
something tells me we' re not alone .
what did you see ?
what do you thing it was ?
looks like a guy about 10 feet ahead .
u. s. army .
show yourself .
stand up and put your hands behind your head .
are you here to help ?
hands behind your head , now !
i' m a doctor .
on your knees .
i work here .
get you hands on your head now !
get down !
gun !
hall' s down !
check him out !
hall !
hall !
get up , hall !
what' s going on back there , o' brien ?
he' s got a pulse .
he' s alive .
the suit is bullet proof all right .
the guy though , where did he go ?
freeze !
trainer , did you see that ?
o' brien , look out !
oh my god !
something' s on my hand !
it' s burning !
what are you doing ?
got to get this off !
it' s burning !
my hand is burning !
burning !
holy shit , o' brien !
my arm is burning !
holy shit , o' brien !
hang on .
we got good air .
i' m taking off your helmet .
i' m going to stick you .
hang in there .
hall , get your ass over here now .
hurry up .
what happened to her ?
come on , we got to get her out of here right now .
move !
move !
we' ve got a problem .
the captain' s been infected .
she needs help , now .
cole , open the door .
i won' t do that .
help !
let me in !
cole , you open the door right now and assist my team .
major , if we let o' brien in here she could kill us all .
listen to me !
you open the goddamn door right now !
trainer , tell me what color her eyes are .
what ?
her eyes .
what color are they ?
they' re black .
black .
it' s too late .
ross .
we' re losing her .
you open the door , now !
give me a sec here , trainer .
i got a situation .
we don' t have a fucking second .
she' s dying !
suit up .
we' re taking her topside .
we can' t do that .
she has been contaminated .
ross , we' re losing her .
open the door !
open it now !
o' brien , this is ross .
you hang in there , all right ?
we can' t take her out of the mountain .
she' il contaminate every living organism she comes in contact with .
civilization as we know it , will no longer exist .
we don' t have a cure for this thing .
she can' t be saved .
get trainer and hall as far away from her as quick as you can .
out there they stand a chance of becoming exposed themselves .
cole ... get out here and fix her up .
she' s my partner , do you hear me ?
open the door .
i said open the goddamn door .
ross , she' s been convulsing ever since she got infected .
what did you do , bastard ?
you shot her , you bastard .
trainer , o' brien was already dead .
what ?
what ?
what she was infected with has no known cure .
if we stand out here , we' il have better chance of becoming infected .
no !
i gave her the shoot !
i gave her the shoot !
she' s dead , man .
we got to get out of here .
that' s an order .
you killed her !
she covered you ass so many times !
she never would have survived .
i gave her the shot .
i did what i was told ... and you should fix her up .
it should have worked !
but it' s a different strain and we have no cure .
now if we get infected , we die exactly like the same way .
this liquid that attacked o' brien ...
is this our alien ?
alien ?
like as in the movie ?
the liquid is a bi product of the alien .
it' s doing exactly what we designed it to do .
you designed a fucking alien ?
no , we cloned an alien .
from a drop of water that was discovered on a meteorite .
weapons specifically designed to help preserve the human race .
but before we could develop the counter inoculation we had to first create de pb3 .
in theory we thought that if we could clone it , we could kill it .
and then , we would be ready in case it ever attacked .
you cloned a frigging alien and the government thought that was ok ?
it' s also extremely intelligent .
i' m going to sit down for this .
each time the pb3 encounters a new organism the alien' s molecular structure co ordinates an attack .
it essentially consume us using our mass and our intelligence to grow ... mutating , changing .
it can almost go into any form liquid or human .
it has the ability to take the human host and attain its goal .
and what the hell goal is that ?
it would like to control the planet .
and it was ok to clone something that could control the planet .
that' s real smart .
real smart .
and you alien escaped , start infecting your crew but somebody caught on and locked the place down .
that seems to be what happened .
but the pb3 is reacting unlike anything we have ever seen before .
what it did to o' brien and hall , that' s new .
it' s trying to breach our suits .
it' s learned to hunt .
if this thing gets out , it will be impossible to stop .
we can' t let that happen .
what do we do to control it ?
we have been developing a ...
cole !
i need to show you something .
excuse us .
it' s the frigging blob .
they' re in love with this thing .
we got to fucking kill it .
harrison convinced me to take it to the next step .
he didn' t want me working with anyone .
classified all my research .
i couldn' t even tell you about it .
what are you talking about ?
i developed a new strain .
you did what ?
the microbe was just the embryo .
there' s 3 chromosomes called x , y , and z and 3 sexes that cross fertilize and mutate into a new organism .
the russians couldn' t do it , you couldn' t do it , but i did .
oh my god !
my god , peter .
why ?
you honestly think you could spend the rest of your life in this hole ?
i' ve been here for 5 years .
i want out .
i want out .
to do what ?
to publish ... to receive the nobel .
but for what ?
the pb3 .
but that' s impossible .
you know it' s impossible .
for the security issues and because there' s nothing to publish .
we still don' t know how it works .
we can find out how it works .
prove that life exists outside our world .
you have screwed us all .
suit up .
we' re leaving .
i never signed up to fight no martians .
command , this is alpha team .
command , alpha team reporting .
this is harrison .
report .
situation .
lang and cole have identified an alien species loose down here .
lang ?
yes , colonel .
are you ready to come out ?
yes , there' s nothing more i can do here .
cole , how serious is it ?
it' s beyond our control , sir .
cole , you call it .
i recommend immediate deployment .
christ .
major ross ?
sir ?
evac your people within 10 minutes .
i' m going to nuke the mountain .
affirmative , sir .
get your people out of there .
thank you , sir .
how far are we going to get in 10 minutes ?
10 minutes is plenty of time .
don' t you worry .
but you' re gonna nuke the mountain .
you can' t get away from a nuclear blast in 10 minutes .
this facility is built to contain the blast .
as long as we make it to an air lock we' il be safe .
you see that ?
straight ahead .
i see it .
what do you think , trainer ?
i think that' s the same stuff that attacked o' brien .
we back track and we go around .
we don' t have time .
don' t worry .
this is what we do .
trainer , hall ...
on my command .
let' s see how this thing responds under fire .
this one' s for o' brien .
fire in the hall !
go !
go !
that' s great !
we just blew a water cooler .
we got to get out of here .
nice shot , bro .
frigging water cooler .
this is just wrong .
time is ticking , we got to go .
stay sharp , hall .
can' t believe we just did that .
goddamn it .
a trained delta force shooting at a water cooler .
what' s next ?
a killer vending machine ?
can' t believe we nailed an alien .
stay focused .
get out of here .
we' re almost there .
we got to make it to the elevator .
trainer , the door .
hall , cover .
copy that .
copy that , sir .
my god , what' s with spiders ?
spiders ?
cole , watch your ...
i hate spiders !
we have to have control of the elevator .
it' s the only way out !
activate fire on the elevator !
clear the elevator !
ross , behind you !
where are they all coming from ?
lang , watch out !
lang , are you ok ?
there' s too many of them !
ross , they' re on your feet !
i got them .
trainer , 12 o' clock .
hall , watch out !
just keep firing , hall .
i don' t know what to do .
my god !
it' s a nightmare , man .
it' s a nightmare !
i don' t know what to do .
don' t !
fire in the hole !
everyone , back up .
is anyone hit ?
hall , what were you thinking ?
i' m going to get out of here .
you just sealed our only exit .
there' s got to be stairs .
there' s no stairs .
he' s going to save us , right ?
i wouldn' t count on it .
fall back , everyone !
fall back !
hall , have you lost your mind ?
there' s got to be another way out .
i sure hope so .
first we' ve got to get to the lab and stop the nuke .
shit , i forgot about the nuke !
we' re screwed .
command , this is alpha team .
ross , you' d better be in that elevator .
elevator is negative for evac , sir .
hostiles in control .
harrison , stop the nuke .
the count is at 00 : 03 : 10 .
any chance you can make the auxiliary air lock ?
negative , sir .
there' s not enough time .
you' il have to re set it manually .
we can handle the manual detonation on this end .
susan , you know what this means .
yes , sir .
it' s your call .
don' t worry .
i' il handle it .
all right , i' il stop the count .
come on !
ok .
we' re here .
the bomb fuse is 5 levels below .
the auxiliary air lock is about 300 yards down the passage way .
peter !
stand back .
nobody touch him .
peter !
peter !
what the fuck is that ?
jesus christ !
where' s the fuck it go ?
peter !
oh , god !
he' s dead .
put your helmets on .
we have to get out of here .
cole , you have anything that can fight this thing ?
yeah , i think i do .
ross , we got to go .
this weapon has been designed for close range combat .
fresh off the assembly line .
they' ve never been tested on either .
wait a minute .
we' re going to be the first ones to use them ?
that' s right .
these are warheads , gentlemen , and they contain a gas design to kill a specific breed of alien .
you' il be fighting a new strain but , hopefully , it should work .
we have to get these toxins out of the warheads and into these canisters to load the guns .
piece of cake .
the toxin was designed to infect those who have not been inoculated .
i hope you don' t mind needles .
shouldn' t i get another warhead ?
back over by the sink .
there' s a case on top , be careful .
doc , what do you make of this ?
oh , god !
oh , god !
what ?
everyone out !
out !
get out , ross !
jesus !
cole , what' s going on ?
we got to get out now !
come on , let' s go .
let' s move !
shit , shit , shit .
what happened to him , cole ?
the toxin .
he' s dead .
cole , answer me .
oh , god ...
our helmets .
the air quality is not good .
we have to make it to a secure air lock .
let' s get out of here .
lang is dead .
we just lost hall .
have you reset bomb ?
not yet .
we' re on our way .
cole , we might be soon facing an invasion .
we need to be prepared .
lang followed orders you wouldn' t .
you shouldn' t let moral judgement interfere with your work .
harrison , we' il set that nuke , but that pb3 experiment ends here .
that ends now .
this is on your head .
cole .
it' s your decision , cole .
are we facing a goddamn invasion ?
it this thing gets out , we' re facing extinction .
how long can we stay exposed to this air ?
long enough to make it to the next air lock it we' re lucky .
cole !
more frigging spiders .
what the frig is that ?
go !
ross , let' s go !
what the hell is that thing ?
run !
cole ?
what is that ?
hurry up !
not enough air in here .
just get to the air lock .
i' m slowing it down , but i' m not stopping it .
oh , no !
the keypad' s not working !
let me at it .
cole , cover trainer .
i got it .
trainer ?
i' m working on it .
trainer .
c4 .
it' il be close .
come on , come on .
i got it .
it' s open .
go .
go , go .
my god .
you guys ok ?
yeah , you ?
i' m cool .
it' s not every day you almost get killed by an alien .
let' s go .
be careful out there .
any more surprises waiting for us down here , cole ?
i sure hope not .
but we should expect the worse .
was that your missing experiment back there ?
i don' t know what that was .
maybe it' s some sort of mutation .
you' re learning quick , major .
let' s just get this over with .
sounds good to me .
everybody watch their backs .
let' s do this .
the bomb is in here .
the air lock is at the other end of the tunnel .
we part company here .
i' il set the bomb and meet you guys outside .
that' s too risky .
we stay together .
ross and i are going to cover the door .
you' re going to go in and set the timer then we all go to the air lock .
ok .
great .
they' re guarding the bomb .
they know we' re trying to kill them .
how do you want to handle this ?
very slowly towards the detonator and hope for the best .
this isn' t going to be easy .
there' s so many of them .
easy ...
they appear to be dormant .
easy ...
no sudden movements .
we should be ok .
let' s get this done and get out .
watch your step .
cover my back , ross .
i' ve got your back .
so far , so good .
oh , my god !
trainer ?
look out !
cole , look out !
trainer , double time .
trainer , come on !
ross , behind you !
look out !
trainer , come on !
trainer , hurry up !
faster !
let' s get out of here .
go , go !
come on !
trainer !
ross !
the timer is toast .
i can' t get it to work .
what ?
it doesn' t work .
the detonator ?
the detonator will work ... but i got to arm it manually .
no .
it' s my responsibility .
i' il do it .
i' il give you enough time to get out .
you' re the only who knows how to fight this thing if it gets out .
sir ?
get her to the exit .
no , major .
that' s an order .
yes , sir .
you' il die .
i' ve got no one waiting for me topside besides how often does a guy get a chance to save the world ?
i' m so sorry .
me too .
trainer .
sir ?
get this to harrison .
my final order and i' d like to make good on it .
yes , sir .
ross ... you' re a brave man .
go on , get out of here .
yes , sir .
let' s go !
cole , look out !
go !
where the hell are they ?
oh shit !
easy ...
trainer , i' m down .
you go .
i' il set the bomb .
no .
this is my responsibility .
not an option , ok ?
trainer ...
i' m not going to argue with you .
it' s what i do .
that' s my job .
go on .
get out of here .
wait .
wait a minute .
ross ... what do you want to do with this ?
that ends here .
i knew you' re going to say that .
get the hell off him .
die , you alien scum !
die !
oh , fuck ...
i love you , mommy .
i love you , baby .
are you ok ?
you all right ?
the others ?
they didn' t make it .
did you secure sample ?
you know i couldn' t do that .
your helmet ?
it' s gone .
you expect me to believe that ?
you' re telling me a story that you couldn' t possibly have witnessed .
you were left behind , you were left for dead .
it was the right thing to do .
i would have infected the team .
it was dangerous to keep me around .
but i followed them out , i witnessed everything .
how did you get out , if cole was the last one in that air lock ?
did you witnesses that explosion ?
the nuke would' ve killed everything .
but you survived .
yes , i did .
how ?
isn' t it obvious ?
i had to survive to keep my species alive .
do you believe in me now ?
captain ... we need to get our guest to the white house .
