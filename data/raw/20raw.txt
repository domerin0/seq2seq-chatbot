sergeant , we have crossed some strange boundary here .
the world has taken a turn for the surreal .
clearly , but the question still stands .
i don' t know .
what do you think ?
you don' t want to know what i think .
no , mike , i do .
well ... part of me thinks the kid' s right .
what' s he done to deserve this ?
lf he wants to stay here , fine , let' s leave him .
yeah .
but another part of me thinks ... what if by some miracle we stay and actually make it out of here ?
someday we might look back and decide that saving private ryan was the one decent thing we were able to pull out of this whole god awful , shitty mess .
that' s what i was thinking , sir .
like you said , captain , if we do that ... we all earn the right to go home .
oh , brother .
this is everything .
two . 30 calibre machine guns , 17 grenades , 1 1 hawkins mines .
you got two bazookas , but only eight rounds left , and assorted small arms .
an arty round took out our . 60 mortar .
might as well be spit wads if they use tanks .
which they' re sure to .
what you thinking , sir ?
well ...
i think they' re going to try to whip around the flanks ...
unless we draw them up here between these buildings , where all the rubble makes a bit of a bottleneck .
disable him ?
lf we can .
make the tank a 60 ton roadblock , we' il have a chance .
yes , sir , don' t let them mass anywhere .
hit hard and fall back to the bridge .
machine gun moving , number two up high to piss on their heads .
that would be the idea .
jackson ?
lf we can , i' d like to get you up in that bell tower .
yes , sir .
give you company if need be .
yes , sir .
company couldn' t hurt .
i' d say a . 30 with about 1 , 000 rounds would be ok .
parker , job opportunity .
not the worst idea , captain .
but it all depends on knocking out the tank here , right ?
so how do you plan on doing that ?
reiben' s right .
as our esteemed colleague from the airborne pointed out , what we got here is spit wads , so how do we stop the tank ?
give it a rabbit to chase .
we could hit the tank in the tracks .
yeah , but with what ?
we could try a sticky bomb .
sticky bomb , sir ?
sir , are you making that up ?
no .
it' s in the field manual .
well , we' re out of field manuals , sir .
perhaps you can enlighten us ?
right , you have demolition some tnt or composition b ?
i got that bridge wired with enough to blow it twice .
you can spare some , then .
you take a standard issue gl sock , cram it with as much comp ' b as possible , rig up a simple fuse , then coat the whole thing with axle grease .
when you throw it , it should stick .
it' s a bomb that sticks .
a sticky bomb .
you know a better way to knock the tracks off a tank , tell me .
this is good .
now we got to surrender our socks .
haul away .
select the field of fire .
cross with the bell tower .
i can cover 12 to nine here .
easy !
i got her !
here are the mines .
for being the best we can do , that forward machine gun is not in a terrible firing position .
and this position right here ... this is the alamo .
they push us back here , last man blows the bridge .
we only got a 30 second fuse , so that last man better hurry , or he won' t be alive long .
captain ?
where am i during all this ?
never more than two feet from me , and that' s not negotiable .
i' il get some ammo .
come on .
upham .
yes .
listen , all right ?
yeah .
listening ?
yes .
all right , we' il be displacing and falling back like crazy ...
so be johnny on the spot with ammo or we' re dead .
right .
understand ?
johnny on the spot .
you all right ?
yeah .
when we shipped out of england ,
i told the supply sergeant handing out cigarettes ,
i don' t smoke .
i don' t smoke .
quite a situation , huh ?
unbelievable .
here .
fucked up beyond all recognition , right ?
yeah , you got that right .
fubar .
yeah , well ...
fubar .
it' il be a real show , huh ?
take it easy .
fubar .
who' s that singing , sir ?
edith piaf .
what' s she so upset about ?
her lover left her , but she still sees his face everywhere she goes .
that would do it .
even life itself
only represents you .
sometimes i dream that i' m in your arms .
what was that part ?
she sang that before .
the chorus .
and you speak softly in my ear ... " and you say things
that make my eyes close , " and i find that marvellous .
uh , again ... upham , uh ... to be honest , i ... l find myself curiously aroused by you .
marvellous .
no , it' s ... it' s a melancholy song .
at the beginning , she says , " and then one day , you left .
you left me , and , uh ...
i' ve been desperate ever since .
i see you all over the sky , i see you all over the earth .
any more of this , the krauts won' t have to shoot me .
i' il just slit my own wrists .
you' re a strange bird , upham .
sorry , it' s edith , you know .
you know what that song reminds me of ?
what mrs rachel troubowitz said when i left for basic .
what , " don' t touch me " ?
no .
mrs rachel troubowitz is our super' s wife .
she tries things on in my mom' s shop , and she' s , like , a 44 ee .
double e ?
these things are massive .
those are big .
i' ve got her convinced that she' s , like , a 42 d.
so she' s trying to squeeze into this side cut , silk ribboned , triple panel girdle with the shelf lift brassiere .
and it' s beautiful , she' s just pouring out of it .
it' s beautiful , and she can tell
i got a hard on the size of the statue of liberty .
and she says , " richard , calm down .
and says , " when you' re over there ,
if you see anything that upsets you ,
just close your eyes and think of these .
you understand ?
so i said , " yes , ma' am .
are you all right , sir ?
yeah , just keeping the rhythm .
ls it true you were a teacher back home ?
yes .
see , that' s something i could never do
not after the way we treated our teachers .
no , sir .
i had a thousand kids like you .
i can' t see my brothers ' faces .
i' ve been trying , and i can' t see them .
has that ever happened to you ?
you gotta think of a context .
what does that mean ?
well , you think about something specific ... something you' ve done together .
when i think of home , i think of something specific .
i think of my hammock in the backyard or ... my wife pruning the rose bushes in a pair of my old work gloves .
well , this one night , two of my brothers came and woke me up in the middle of the night , and they said they had a surprise for me .
they took me to the barn , into the loft , and ... there was my oldest brother dan ... with alice ... alice jardine .
i mean ... picture a girl who took a nosedive from the ugly tree and hit every branch coming down .
and ... and dan' s got her shirt off .
so he' s working on this bra , and all of a sudden , sean just screams out ...
danny , you' re a young man !
don' t do it !
and alice jardine screams , and jumps up , and tries to get out , but this shirt' s over her head , and she runs into the wall and knocks herself out .
so now dan is so mad , he starts coming after us , but alice is there unconscious , he' s gotta wake her up .
so he grabs her leg , and he' s dragging her .
and he picks up a shovel and goes after sean .
sean says , " why are you trying to hit me ?
i did you a favour .
and this makes dan more angry .
he tries to swing this thing .
it goes out of his grasp and hits a kerosene lantern .
the thing explodes , and the whole barn almost goes up .
that was it ... dan went to basic next day .
that was the last night the four of us were together .
that was two years ago .
tell me about your wife and those rose bushes .
no .
no .
that one i save just for me .

earn it .
my dear mrs ryan , it' s with a profound sense of joy that i write to inform you your son private james ryan is well and , at this very moment , on his way home from european battlefields .
reports from the front indicate james did his duty in combat with great courage and steadfast dedication even after informed of the tragic loss your family has suffered in this great campaign to rid the world of tyranny and oppression .
i take great pleasure in joining the secretary of war , the united states army and the citizens of a grateful nation in wishing you good health and many years of happiness with james at your side .
nothing , not even the safe return of a beloved son , can compensate you or the thousands of other families who have suffered great loss in this tragic war .
i share with you some words which sustained me through long , dark nights of peril , loss and heartache .
and i quote ,
i pray that our heavenly father
may assuage the anguish of your bereavement
and leave you only the cherished memory
of the loved and lost
and the solemn pride that must be yours
to have laid so costly a sacrifice
upon the alter of freedom .
abraham lincoln .
yours very sincerely and respectfully ,
george c marshall , general , chief of staff .
my family is with me today .
they wanted to come with me .
to be honest with you ,
i wasn' t sure how i' d feel coming back here .
every day i think about what you said to me that day on the bridge .
and i' ve tried to live my life the best i could .
i hope that was enough .
i hope that , at least in your eyes ,
i' ve earned what all of you have done for me .
james .
captain john h miller .
tell me i' ve led a good life .
what ?
tell me i' m a good man .
you are .
