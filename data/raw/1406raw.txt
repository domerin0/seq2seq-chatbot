mr. popper , what is my policy on ringing phones in the classroom ?
i' m sorry , sir .
yes , well ... ... you' re barely passing my class as it is , mr. popper .
it won' t happen again , sir .
for your sake , i hope not .
i turned it off .
i know i did .
they know you know .
they' re coming for you .
get out .
get out now !
you are in serious trouble , mr. popper .
stop right there !
mr. popper .
neo , i believe .
i know it wasn' t a dream .
this is not real .
and the real world lies somewhere else .
a typical mental delusion .
we get unbalanced kids like this all the time .
reality can be a pretty scary thing for some people .
this world must have been a cold and alienating place for a boy like that .
it' s called denying reality .
it' s , you know , just a self defense mechanism for those type of kids .
well , he' s in another world now .
make no mistake about that .
his vitals are good .
he' s gonna make it .
it' s unbelievable .
i didn' t think self substantiation was possible .
apparently , it is .
neo .
it' s okay .
you' re safe now .
i knew ... ... you' d save me .
i didn' t save you , kid .
you saved yourself .
