# see them tumbling down #
# pledging their love to the ground #
a way out west there was this fella , fella i want to tell you about , fella by the name of jeff lebowski , at least that was the handle
that his loving parents gave him .
but he never had much use for it himself .
this lebowski , he called himself the dude .
now dude , that' s a name no one would self apply where i come from .
but then , there was a lot about the dude that didn' t make a whole lot of sense to me , and a lot about where he lived , likewise .
but then again , maybe that' s why i found the place so dern interesting .
they call los angeles the city of angels .
i didn' t find it to be that exactly .
but i' il allow there are some nice folks there .
' course i can' t say i seen london ,
and i never been to france ,
and i ain' t never seen no queen in her damned undies as the fella says .
but i' il tell you what , after seeing los angeles
and this a here story i' m about to unfold ,
well , i guess i seen somethin ' every bit as stupefyin ' as you' d see in any of those other places , and in english , too .
so i can die with a smile on my face without feeling like the good lord gypped me .
now this here story i' m about to unfold took place back in the early nineties , just about the time of our conflict with saddam and the iraqis .
i only mention it ' cause sometimes there' s a man ,
i won' t say a hero ,
' cause what' s a hero ?
but sometimes there' s a man , and i' m talking about the dude here , sometimes there' s a man , he' s the man for his time and place .
he fits right in there , and that' s the dude , in los angeles .
and even if he' s a lazy man , and the dude was most certainly that , quite possibly the laziest in los angeles county , which would place him high in the running for laziest worldwide .
but sometimes there' s a man , sometimes ...
there' s a man .
wow , lost my train of thought here .
i done introduced him enough .
all for a collective action .
this will not stand .
this will not stand , this aggression against kuwait .
# here on the range i belong #
# drifting along with the tumbling #
# tumbleweed #
where' s the money , lebowski ?
i want that money , lebowski .
bunny says you' re good for it .
where' s the money , lebowski ?
where' s the fucking money , shithead ? !
it' s down there somewhere .
let me take another look .
don' t fuck with us !
your wife owes money to jackie treehorn ,
that means you own money to jackie treehorn .
ever thus to deadbeats , lebowski .
no , no , don' t do that
not on the rug , man .

yeah , what do you think ?
he looks like a fucking loser .
hey , at least i' m housebroken .
fucking time wasted .
thanks a lot , asshole .
# the man in me will do #
# nearly any task #
# and as for compensation #
# there' s a little he would ask #
# take a woman like you #
# to get through #
# to the man in me #
# the storm clouds are raging #
# all around my door #
# i think to myself #
# i might not take it anymore #
# take a woman like your kind #
# to find the man in me #
# but , oh #
# what a wonderful feeling #
# just to know that you are near #
# that sets my heart a reelin ' #
# from my toes #
# up to my ears #
# the man in me will hide sometimes #
# to keep from being seen #
# but that' s just because #
# he doesn' t want to turn into some machine #
# take a woman like you #
# to get through #
# to the man in me #
i' m throwing rocks tonight .

uh , you know , a handicapped guy ?
mr. lebowski is disabled , yes .
uh , this picture was taken when mrs. reagan was first lady of the nation ,

not of california .
pope john . .. in fact , he met privately with the president , though unfortunately ,
there wasn' t enough time for a photo opportunity .
oh , nancy' s pretty good .
oh , wonderful woman . we' re very happy these are ... oh , those are mr. lebowski' s children , so to speak .
different mothers , huh ?
racially , pretty cool .
they' re not literally his children .
they' re the little lebowski urban achievers ,
inner city children of promise but without the necessary means for necessary means for a higher education .
so mr. lebowski is committed to sending all of them to college .
excuse me .
thank you .
thank you .
far out .
think he' s got room for one more ?
you never went to college .
please , don' t touch that .
yeah , no , i did , but , you know ,
i spent most of my time , um , occupying various administration buildings , smoking a lot of thai stick , breaking into the r. o. t. c. , and bowling . to tell you the truth , brandt ,
i don' t remember most of it .
ok , sir , you' re a lebowski , i' m a lebowski ,
that' s terrific .
but i' m very busy , as i imagine you are .
what can i do for you , sir ?
uh , well , sir , it' s , this rug i have .
it really tied the room together .
you told brandt on the phone , he told me .
where do i fit in ?
well , they were
they were looking for you , these 2 guys .
i' il say it again .
you told brandt on the phone , he told me .

yes ?
yes ?
oh , so you know that
they were trying to piss on your rug ?
did i urinate on your rug ?
you mean , did you personally come and pee on my rug ?
hello !
do you speak english , son ?
parla usted ingles ?
i' il ask you again .
did i urinate on your rug ?
no , like i said , woo peed on my rug .
i just want to understand this , sir .
every time a rug is micturated upon
in this fair city , i have to compensate the person
come on , man ,
i' m not trying io scam anybody here . .. you know , i .. was just
you were just looking for a handout
like every other ...
are you employed , mr. lebowski ?
uh , wait , let me
let me explain something to you .
i am not mr. lebowski .
you' re mr. lebowski .
i' m the dude .
so that' s what you call me ,
you know , that or , his dudeness ,
or , duder , or , you know , el duderino ,
if you' re not into the whole brevity thing .
are you employed , sir ?
employed ?
you don' t go out looking for a job dressed like that , do you , on a weekday ?
is this a .. what day is this ?
well , i do work , sir .
so if you don' t mind
no , i do mind .
uh , the dude minds .
this will not stand , you know .
this aggression will not stand , man .
i mean , your wife owes
my wife is not the issue here !
i hope that someday my wife will learn to live on her allowance , which is ample , but if she does not , that is her problem , not mine , just as the rug is your problem , just as every bum' s lot in life is his own responsibility , regardless of who he chooses to blame .
i didn' t blame anyone for the loss of my legs .
some chinaman took them from me in korea .
but i went out and achieved anyway .
i cannot solve your problems , sir , only you can .
oh , fuck it .
yes , that' s your answer .
that' s your answer to everything .
tattoo it on your forehead .
your revolution is over , mr. lebowski !
condolences !
the bums lost !
my advice to you is to do what your parents did !
get a job , sir !
the bums will always lose !
do you hear me , lebowski ? !
the bums will always lose !
how was your meeting , mr. lebowski ?
ok .
the old man told me to take any rug in the house .
well , enjoy , and perhaps we' il see you again sometime , dude .
yeah , sure , if i' m in the neighborhood ,
you know , and ...
i need to use the john .
blow on them .
go ahead , blow .
you want me to blow on your , toes ?
i can' t blow that far .
are you sure he won' t mind ?
he really doesn' t care about anything .
he' s a nihilist .
oh , and that must be exhausting .
you' re not blowing .
our guest has to be getting along , mrs. lebowski .
oh , you' re bunny .
i' il suck your cock for $1, 000 .
wonderful woman .
we' re all .. we' re all very fond of her .
very free spirited .
brandt can' t watch , though ,
or he has to pay 100 . .. that' s marvelous .
uh , i' m just gonna go find a cash machine .
slamming them tonight .
you guys are dead in the water .
all right !
way to go , donny !
if you will it , it is no dream .
you' re fucking 20 minutes late , man .
what the fuck is that ?
theodore herzel .
the state of israel .
if you will it , dude ,
it is no dream .
what the fuck you talking about , man ?
the carrier .
what' s in the fucking carrier ?
oh , cynthia s dog .
i think it' s a pomeranian .
i can' t leave him home alone or he eats the furniture .
i' m watching it while cynthia and marty ackerman are in hawaii .
you brought a fucking pomeranian bowling ?
what do you mean , " brought it bowling " ?
i didn' t rent it shoes ,
i' m not buying it a fucking beer , he' s not taking your fucking turn , dude .
man , if my fucking ex wife asked me to take care of her fucking dog while she and her boyfriend went to honolulu ,
i' d tell her to go fuck herself .
why can' t she board it ?
first of all , dude , you don' t have an ex .
secondly , this is a fucking show dog with fucking papers .
you can' t board it .
it gets upset .
its hair falls out .
the fucking dog has fucking papers .
over the line !
i' m sorry , smokey , you were over the line .
that' s a foul .
bullshit .
mark it 8 , dude .
uh , excuse me , mark it zero .
next frame .
bullshit , walter .
mark it 8 , dude .
smokey , this is not ' nam , this is bowling .
there are rules .
hey , walter , come on , it' s just
hey , man , it' s smokey .
so his toe slipped over a little .
you know , it' s just a game , man .
this is a league game .
this determines who enters the next round robin .
am i wrong ?
yeah , but i wasn' t
am i wrong ?
yeah , but i wasn' t over .
give me the marker , dude .
i' m marking an 8 .
smokey , my friend ,
you' re entering a world of pain .
walter , man .
you mark that frame an 8 ,
you' re entering a world of pain .
a world of pain .
look , dude , this is your partner .
has the whole world gone crazy ? !
am i the only one around here who gives a shit about the rules ? !
mark it zero !
they' re calling the cops , man .
put the piece away .
mark it zero !
walter , put the piece away .
you think i' m fucking around here ?
mark it zero !
all right , it' s fucking zero .
you happy , you crazy fuck ?
it' s a league game , smoke .
you can' t do that , man .
these guys , you know , they' re like me .
they' re pacifists .
smokey was a conscientious objector .
you know , dude , i , myself , dabbled in pacifism at one point , not in ' nam , of course .
and you know he' s got emotional problems , man .
you mean , beyond pacifism ?
he' s fragile , very fragile .
huh .
i did not know that .
.. it' s all water under the bridge , and we do enter the next round robin .
am i wrong ?
no , you' re not wrong .
am i wrong ?
you' re not wrong , walter , you' re just an asshole !
ok , then .
we play quintana and o brien next week .
they should be pushovers .
man , will you just
just take it easy , man .
you know , that' s your answer for everything , dude .
and let me point out something .
pacifism is not look at our current situation with that camelfucker in iraq .
pacifism is not something to hide behind .
just take it easy , man .
i' m perfectly calm , dude .
yeah , waving the fucking gun around ?
calmer than you are .
will you just take it easy ?
calmer than you are .
dude , this is smokey .
look , i don' t want to be a hard on about this , and i know it wasn' t your fault , but i just thought it was fair to tell you that gilbert and i will be submitting this to the league and asking them to set aside the round ,
i don' t know , maybe forfeit it to us .
so , like i say , just thought , you know , fair warning .
tell walter .
i' m sorry .
mr. lebowski , this is brandt at , well , at mr. lebowski' s office .
please call us as soon as it' s convenient .
mr. lebowski , this is bill selliger of the southern cal bowling league , and i just got an informal report that a member of your team , a walter sobchak , drew a firearm during league play .
if this is true , of course , it contravenes a number of the league' s bylaws and also article 27 of the league
dude , i .. finally got ..
i got the , the venue i wanted .
i' m performing my dance quintet , you know , my cycle , at crane jackson' s fountain street theater on tuesday night , and , well , i d love it if you came and gave me notes .

thank you .
mr. lebowski , brandt again .

i hope you' re not avoiding this call because of the rug ..
which , i assure you , is not a problem .
we need your help , and ...
well , we' d very much like to see you .
thank you . it' s brandt .
we' ve had some terrible news .
mr. lebowski' s in seclusion in the west wing .
funny ...
i can look back on a life of achievement , challenges met , competitors bested , obstacles overcome .
i' ve accomplished more than most men and without the use of my legs .
what makes a man , mr. lebowski ?
i .. don' t know , sir .
is it being prepared to do the right thing ?
whatever the cost ?
isn' t that what makes a man ?
sure , that and a pair of testicles .
you' re joking .
but ...
perhaps you' re right .
you mind if i do a " j " ?
bunny ...
excuse me ?
bunny lebowski ,
she is the light of my life .
are you surprised at my tears , sir ?
fuckin ' a .
strong men also cry .
i received this fax this morning .
as you can see , it is a ransom note .
we have bunnie .
written by men who are unable to achieve on a level field of play .
gather one million dollars in unmarked , non consecutive twenties .
weaklings .
await instructions .
bums !
no funny stuff .
bummer .
this is a bummer , man .
that' s , that' s a bummer .
brandt will fill you in on the details .
mr. lebowski is prepared to make a generous offer to you to act as courier once we get instructions for the money .
why me , man ?
he believes the culprits might be the very people who ... soiled your rug , and you' re in a unique position to confirm or disconfirm that suspicion .
he thinks the carpet pissers did this ?
well , dude , we just don' t know .
fucking quintana .
that creep can roll , man .
yeah , but he' s a pervert , dude .
no .
he' s a sex offender with a record .
he did 6 months at chino for exposing himself to an 8 year old .
when he moved to hollywood ,
he had to go door to door to tell everyone he was a pederast .
what' s a pederast , walter ?
shut the fuck up , donny .
how much they give you ?
20 grand , man .
and , of course , i still get to keep the rug .
just for making the hand off ?
yeah .
they gave , dude a beeper .
now , so whenever these guys call
what if it' s during a game ?
oh , i told them if it was during league play ...
what' s during league play ?
life does not stop and start at your convenience , you miserable piece of shit .
i figure ...
what' s wrong with walter , dude ?
i figure it' s easy money .
it' s all pretty harmless .
she probably kidnapped herself .
what do you mean , dude ?
rug pee ers did not do this .
look at it .
a young trophy wife marries this guy for his money .
she figures he isn' t giving her enough .
you know , she owes money all over town .
that fuckin ' ...
bitch .
it' s all goddamn fake , man .
it' s like lenin said .
you look for the person who will benefit , and , you know ...
i am the walrus ?
you know , you' il ...

here' s the money .
and the phone .

mr. lebowski asked me to repeat that .
her life is in your hands .

where the fuck are you goin ' , man ?
take the ringer .
i' il drive .

what the
what the hell is this ?
my dirty undies , dude .

the whites .
walter , i' m sure there' s a reason you brought your dirty undies , man .
that' s right , dude .
the weight .
the ringer cannot look empty .
walter , what the fuck are you thinking , man ?
you' re right , dude .
i got to thinking .
i got to thinking why should we settle for a measly fuckin ' 20 grand
we ?
what the fuck we ?
you said you just wanted to come along .
my point , dude , is why should we settle for 20 grand when we can keep the entire million ?
am i wrong ?
yes , you' re wrong .
this isn' t a fuckin ' game , man .
oh , but it is a game .
you said so yourself .
she kidnapped herself .
i said i thought
dude here .
who is this ?
dude the bagman , man .
where do you want us to go ?
us ?
yeah , you know , me and the driver .
i' m not handling the money , driving the car , and talking on the phone all by my
shut the fuck up !
dude , are you fuckin ' this up ?
who is that ?
that is the driver .
i told you
what the fuck' s goin ' on ?
walter !
what the fuck is goin ' on ?
he hung up , man !
you fucked it up !
her life was in our hands , man .
easy , dude .
we' re screwed now .
we don' t get shit .
they' re gonna kill her .
we' re fucked , walter .
nothing is fucked , dude .
come on , you' re being very un dude .
they' il call back .
look , she kidnapped
you see ?
nothing' s fucked here , dude .
nothing is fucked .
they' re a bunch of fuckin ' amateurs !
hey , walter , will you just shut the fuck up ?
don' t say peep while i' m doin ' business here , man .
ok , dude , have it your way .
but they' re amateurs .
ok , we proceed .
but only if there' s no funny stuff .
so no funny stuff , ok ?
just tell me where the fuck you want us to go .
that was the sign , man .
so all we gotta do is get her back ,
no one' s in a position to complain ,
and we keep the baksheesh .
yeah , terrific , walter , but you haven' t told me how we' re gonna get her back .
where is she ?
that' s the simple part , dude .
we make the hand off ,
i grab one of ' em , beat it out of him .
yeah .
that' s a great plan .
walter , that' s fucking ingenious ,
if i understand it correctly .
it' s a swiss fuckin ' watch .
that' s right , dude .
the beauty of this is its simplicity .
once a plan gets too complex , everything can go wrong .
if there' s one thing i learned in ' nam , it' s
you' re coming to a wooden bridge .
when you cross the bridge , you throw the bag from the left window of the moving car .
you' re being watched .
what' d he say ?
where' s the hand off ?
there is no fuckin ' hand off , man .
at the wooden bridge , we throw the money out of the car .
we throw the money out of the moving car .
no , we can' t do that , dude .
that fucks up our plan .
well , call ' em up and explain it to them , walter .
your plan is so fuckin ' simple
i' m sure they' il fuckin ' understand it .
that' s the beauty of it .
wooden bridge , huh ?
i' m throwin ' the money , walter .
we' re not fuckin ' around , man .
ok , dude , bridge is comin ' up .
give me the ringer , chop chop .
fuck that , walter .
i love ya , but sooner or later you' re gonna have to face the fact you' re a goddamn moron .
ok , dude .
no time to argue .
hey , man .
the bridge .
there goes the ringer !
what the fuck ? !
here , dude , your wheel .
at 15 mph , i roll out .
i double back , grab one , and beat it out of him .
the uzi .
uzi ? !
you didn' t think i was rolling out of here naked ?
walter , please ..
15 , dude .
this is it .
let' s take that hill !
we have it !
we ... have it !
aw , fuck it , dude .
let' s go bowling .
etz chaim he , dude , as the ex used to say .
what the fuck is that supposed to mean ?
what the fuck are we gonna tell lebowski ?
well , what exactly is the problem ?
the problem is
what do you mean , what' s the
there was no ...
we .. didn' t ...
they' re gonna kill that poor woman , man .
what the fuck are you talking about ?
the poor woman that poor slut kidnapped herself .
come on , dude , you said so yourself .
man , i said i thought she kidnapped herself .
you' re the one who' s so fuckin ' certain .
that' s right , dude .
100 % certain .
they posted the next round for the tournament .
donny , shut the fuck when do we play ?

saturday ?
well , they have to reschedule .
walter , what am i gonna tell lebowski ?
i told that fuck down at the league office
who' s in charge of scheduling ?
i told that kraut a fuckin ' thousand times
i don' t roll on shabbos .

well , he can fuckin ' unpost it !
who gives a shit ? !
they' re gonna kill that poor woman , man .

how come you don' t roll on saturday , walter ?
i' m shomer shabbos .
what' s that , walter ?
yeah , and in the meantime ,

that means i don' t work ,
i don' t drive a car , i don' t fuckin ' ride in a car ,
i don' t handle money , i don' t turn on the oven , and i sure as shit don' t fucking roll !
shomer shabbos !
shomer fucking shabbos .
oh , fuck !
that' s it !
i' m outta here .
oh , come on , dude .
look , you just tell him
tell him we made the drop , and everything went , you know ...
oh , yeah , how' d it go ?
went all right .
dude' s car got a little dinged up .
walter , we didn' t make the fuckin ' hand off , man .
they didn' t get the fuckin ' money !
and they' re gonna ..
they' re gonna kill that poor woman .
they' re gonna kill that poor woman
hey , walter , if you can' t ride in a car , how do you get around on shammos ?
really , dude , you surprise me .
they' re not gonna kill shit , they' re not gonna do shit .
what can they do to her ?
they' re a bunch of fuckin ' amateurs ,
and meanwhile , look at the bottom line .
who' s sittin ' on a million fucking dollars ?
who' s got a fuckin ' million fuckin ' dollars sitting in the trunk of our car ?
our car , walter ?
and what do they got ?
my dirty undies .
my fuckin ' whites .
say , dude .
where is your car ?
who' s got your undies , walter ?
where' s your car , dude ?
you don' t know , walter ?
it was parked in a handicap zone .
perhaps they towed it .
you fuckin ' know it' s been stolen .
well , certainly that' s a possibility , dude .
oh , fuck it .
where you goin ' , dude ?
i' m goin ' home , donny .
phone' s ringing , dude .
thank you , donny .
green .
some , brown or ...
rust coloration .
and was there anything of value in the car ?
... a tape deck , some creedence tapes , and there was a ... my briefcase .
in the briefcase ?
.. papers .
you know just papers .
you know , my papers .
business papers .
and what do you do , sir ?
i' m unemployed .
my rug was also stolen .
your rug was in the car ?
no , here .
separate incidents ?
do you find them much , these stolen cars ?
sometimes .
wouldn' t hold out much hope for the tape deck , though .
or the creedence .
well , what about ...
the briefcase ?
mr. lebowski , i' d like to see you .
call when you get home , and i' il send a car for you .
my name is maude lebowski .
i' m the one who took your rug .
guess we can close the file on that one .
el franco , ay`dame abajo .
i' il be with you in a moment , mr. lebowski .
does the female form make you uncomfortable , mr. lebowski ? .. is that what this is a picture of ?
in a sense , yes .
my art has been commended as being strongly vaginal , which bothers some men .
the word itself makes some men uncomfortable .
vagina .
oh , yeah ?
yes , they don' t like hearing it and find it difficult to say , whereas without batting an eye , a man will refer to his dick or his rod
or his ...
johnson .
johnson ?
all right , mr. lebowski .
let' s get down to cases .
my father told me he agreed to let you have the rug , but as it was a gift from me to my late mother , it was not his to give .
your face .
as for this kidnapping ...
yes , i know all about it ,
and i know that you acted as courier .
let me tell you something .
the whole thing stinks to high heaven .
right , but let me explain something
about the rug .
do you like sex , mr. lebowski ?
excuse me ?
sex .
the physical act of love .
coitus .
do you like it ?
i was talking about my rug .
you' re not interested in sex ?
you mean coitus ?
i like it , too .
it' s a male myth about feminists
that we hate sex .
it can be a natural , zesty enterprise .
however , there are some people
it is called satyriasis in men , nymphomania in women who engage in it compulsively and without joy .
oh , yes , mr. lebowski .
these unfortunate souls cannot love in the true sense of the word .
our mutual acquaintance bunny is one of these .
listen , maude , um , i' m sorry if your stepmother is a nympho , but , you know ,
i don' t see what this has to do with ...
do you have any kahlua ?
take ' a look at this , sir .
oh , i know that guy .
he' s a nihilist .
hello .
meine dispatcher says there' s something wrong mitt deine kable .
yeah , come on in .
i' m not really sure exactly what' s really wrong with the cable .
zat' s why they sent me .
i am an expert .
the tv' s in here .
you recognize her , of course .
oh , that' s my friend shari .
she just came over to use the shower .
the story is ludicrous .
meine nommen is karl .
ich bin expert .
you must be here to fix the cable .
lord , you can imagine where it goes from here .
he fixes the cable ?
don' t be fatuous , jeffrey .
little matter to me that this woman chose to pursue a career in pornography nor that she has been " banging " jackie treehorn , to use the parlance of our times , however ,
i am one of the 2 trustees of the lebowski foundation , the other being my father .
the foundation takes youngsters from watts and
shit , yeah , the achievers .
little lebowski urban achievers , yes , and proud we are of all of them ,
i asked my father about his withdrawal of $1 million from the foundation account , and he told me about this abduction .
but i tell you , it is preposterous .
this compulsive fornicator is taking my father for the proverbial ride .
yeah , but my
i' m getting to your rug .
my father and i don' t get along .
he doesn' t approve of my lifestyle , and , needless to say , i don' t approve of his .
however , i hardly wish to make my father' s embezzlement a police matter , so i' m proposing that you try to recover the money from the people you delivered it to .
well , i could do that .
if you successfully do so , i will compensate you to the tune of 10 % of the recovered sum .
a hundred ...
thousand .
yes .
bones or clams or whatever you call them .
yeah , but ...
what about my ...
your rug , yes . well , with that money you can buy any number of rugs
that don' t have sentimental value for me .
and i am sorry about that crack on the jaw .
oh , th that' s fine .
that doesn' t even ...
here' s the name and number of a doctor who will look at it for you .
you will receive no bill .
he' s a good man , and thorough .
th that' s thoughtful , but
please see him , jeffrey .
he' s a good man , and thorough .
oh , well ...
all right .
all right .
so he says , " my wife' s a pain in the ass .
she' s always bustin ' my friggin ' agates .
my daughter' s married to a real loser bastard , and i got a rash so bad on my ass
i can' t even sit down .
but you know me , i can' t complain .
ah , fuckin ' a , man .
i got a rash , man .
fuckin ' a .
i gotta tell you , tone , man ,
earlier in the day , i was really feeling shitty , man .
really down in the dumps .
lost a little money ...
hey , you know what ? forget about it , huh ?
forget about it .
yeah , fuck it , man .
i can' t be worried about that shit .
life goes on , man .
home , sweet home , mr. l.
who' s your friend in the volkswagen ?
yeah , he followed us here .
when did he start foll
what the fuck ? !
in the limo , you son of a bitch .
no arguing .
hey , careful , man . there' s a beverage here .
start talking and talk fast , you lousy bum .
we' ve been frantically trying to reach you , dude .
where' s my goddamn money , you bum ? !
well , we ...
they did not receive the money , you nitwit !
they did not receive the money !
her life was in your hands !
this is our concern , dude .
no , man , nothing is fucked here .
nothing is fucked ? !
the goddamn plane
has crashed into the mountain !
look , man , come on .
who are you gonna believe , those guys or ...
we dropped off the damn money .
we ? !
the royal we .
you know , the editorial .
i dropped off the money exactly as per
look .
man , i' ve got certain information , all right ?
certain things have come to light , and ...
you know , has it ever occurred to you that instead of , you know , running around , blaming me , given the nature of all this new shit , this could be a lot more , ... .. complex ?
i mean , it might not be just such a simple ,
you know ?
what in god' s holy name
are you blathering about ?
well , i' il tell you what i' m blathering about .
i' ve got information , man .
new shit has come to light .
and ... shit , man ...
she kidnapped herself .
well , sure , man .
look at it .
you know , a young trophy wife
in the parlance of our times , you know
she .. owes money all over town ,
including to known pornographers .
and that' s cool . that that' s cool .
i' m saying , she needs money , man .
and ... you know , of course they' re gonna say they didn' t get it , because she wants more , man .
she' s gotta feed the monkey .
i mean ...
hasn' t that ever occurred to you , man ?
no , mr. lebowski , it had not occurred to me .
that had not occurred to us , dude .
well , ok , you know , you guys aren' t privy to all the new shit , so ... .. you know .
but ... .. that' s what you that' s what you pay me for .
speaking of which , do you think that you could , give me my 20, 000 in cash ?
my concern is .. and i gotta check with my accountant but this might bump me into a higher tax ,
brandt ...
give him the envelope .
oh , well , if you' ve already got the check made out ,
th that' s cool .
we received this this morning .
since you have failed to achieve , even in the modest task which was your charge , since you have stolen my money , since you have unrepentantly betrayed my trust ...
i have no choice but to tell these bums to do whatever is necessary to recover their money from you , jeffrey lebowski .
and with brandt as my witness ,
any further harm visited upon bunny will be visited tenfold upon your head .
by god , sir , i will not abide another toe .
that wasn' t her toe , dude .
whose toe was it , walter ?
how the fuck should i know ?
i do know that nothing about it indicates
man , the nail polish , walter .
fine , dude .
as if it' s impossible to get some nail polish ,
apply it to someone else' s toe .
someone else' s
where the fuck are they gonna get
you want a toe ?
i can get you a toe .
believe me , there are ways , dude .
you don' t wanna know about it , believe me .
hell , i can get you a toe by 3 : 00 this afternoon , with nail polish .
these fuckin ' amateurs .
they send us a toe , we' re supposed to shit ourselves with fear .
now , the point is
they' re gonna kill her , walter ,
and then they' re gonna kill me .
dude ...
that' s ...
that' s just the stress talking , man .
now so far we have what appears to me
to be a series of victimless crimes .
what about the toe ?
forget about the fucking toe !
excuse me , sir ,
could you please keep your voices down ?
this is a family restaurant .
oh , please , dear .
for your information , the supreme court has roundly rejected prior restraint !
walter , this is not a first amendment thing .
if you don' t calm down ,
i' m gonna have to ask you to leave .
lady , i got buddies who died face down in the muck so you and i could enjoy this family restaurant !
all right , i' m outta here .
hey , dude , don' t go away , man .
come on , this affects all of us , man .
our basic freedoms !
i' m stayin ' .
i' m finishing my coffee .
enjoying my coffee .
thanks , man .
mr. lebowski , this is duty officer rolvaag of the lapd .
we' ve recovered your automobile .
it can be claimed at the north hollywood auto circus there on victory .
far out , man .
far fucking out !
this is a private residence , man .
ah , nice marmot .

you think ve are kidding
or making with the funny stuff ?
there are things you haven' t dreamed of , lebowski .

he believes in nothing , lebowski , nothing . and tomorrow ve come back and ve cut off your chonson .
excuse me ?
i said we' il cut off your johnson !

it was discovered last night in van nuys
lodged against an abutment .
oh , man , lodged where ?
you' re lucky she didn' t get chopped ,
mr. lebowski .
must' ve been a joyride situation .
they abandoned the vehicle once they hit the retaining wall .
oh , my fucking briefcase !
man , it' s not here .
shit !
yeah , i saw that on the report .
sorry .
you gotta get in on the other side .
the side view was found on the road by the car .
you' re lucky they left the tape deck , though ,
and the creedence .
aw , jesus !
what' s that smell , man ?
probably a vagrant slept in the car or maybe just used it as a toilet and moved on .
are you gonna find these guys or , you know ,
i mean , you got any promising , uh , leads or ...
leads ?
yeah .
sure .
i' il just check with the boys down at the crime lab .
they , got 4 more detectives
working on the case .
they got us working in shifts .
leads .
my only hope is that the big lebowski kills me
before the germans can cut my dick off .
now , that is just ridiculous , dude .
no one' s going to cut your dick off .
thank you , walter .
not if i have anything to say about it .
thank you , walter .
that makes me feel very secure .
dude .
that makes me feel very warm inside .
now , dude .
this whole fuckin ' thing .
i could be sitting here with just pee stains on my rug .
yeah .
but , no , man , i gotta , you know .
fucking germans .
nothing changes .
fucking nazis .
they were nazis , dude ?
oh , come on , donny .
they were threatening castration .
are we gonna split hairs here ?
am i wrong ?
well , he ..
they were nihilists , man .
they kept saying they believed in nothing .
nihilists .
fuck me .
i mean , say what you want about the tenets of national socialism , dude .
at least it' s an ethos .
and also , let' s not forget
let s not forget , dude
that keeping wildlife , um , an amphibious rodent for , um , you know , domestic ...
within the city ...
that ain' t legal either .
what are you , a fucking park ranger now ?
no , i' m just trying
who gives a shit about the fucking marmot ?
we are sympathizing here , dude .
fuck sympathy .
i don' t need your fucking sympathy , man .
i need my fucking johnson .
what do you need that for , dude ?
you have got to buck up , man !
you cannot drag this negative energy
into the tournament .
fuck the tournament .
fuck you , walter .
