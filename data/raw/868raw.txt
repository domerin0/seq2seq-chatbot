jacques !
jacques , you' re late !
i' m late .

there will be changes around here after today , and i will personally see that you will be the first one to go .
allow me .
wipe off those filthy hands !
take this .
oh , for me ?
carry it to the house , you idiot !
here you are , my dear .
do come in , edmund .
my dear lillian .
i' m so sorry i' m late , but there' s so much to do in handling the oglethorpe enterprises now that dear oscar has passed on .
you are a good friend , edmund .
and such a comfort in my time of need .
i hope more than a friend , lillian .
as the lawyer for the oglethorpe family ,
i have been entrusted with the last will and testament of oscar winterhaven oglethorpe .
edmund , i beg your pardon .
yes , dear lady ?
i must apologize , but we really must wait for my personal solicitor , roland t. flakfizer .
jacques .
lillian ,
i' ve been employed by your late husband for over 1 3 years .
are you dismissing me ?
good heavens , no , edmund .
i was involved in a minor accident with the bentley last year .
miraculously , he was by my side to assist me .
oh , jacques , i want you to go to this address and summon this gentleman at once .
i' ve been calling all morning and leaving messages .
i can' t seem to reach him .
yes , mrs. o ...
lillian , how long must we wait ?
i can assure you , once mr. flakfizer receives my message , he will race to be by my side .
anyone hurt ?
roland t. flakfizer , attorney at law .
don' t try to get up .
i specialize in accident cases .
we' re both fine .
i know what i' m doing , i know what i' m doing .
you wouldn' t happen to have any french fries on you , would you ?
all right , all right .
step back , step back .
i' ve got injured clients here .
sir , you have caused grievous harm to my clients and their vehicle .
and through your negligence , this child has suffered severe neck injuries .
leave me alone .
stick with me , kid , and you can afford enough nintendo software to sink a battleship .
i can sue my parents ?
i sued mine .
my neck !
corruptible youth .
god bless them .
my lord , madam .
you shouldn' t be walking in your condition .
this woman is with child .
if any harm came to this infant , by god , sir , you will feel my wrath in court .
what are you talking about ?
don' t try to weasel out of this .
dozens of witnesses saw your reckless driving .
how many of you saw this man carelessly , and without regard for life and property , careen into my clients at almost 85 miles per hour ?
and who of you will tell their story to my young , 24 year old ,
miss lnternational wet t shirt champion , nymphomaniac secretary ?
yo !
right here !
right here !
hey , hey !
flakfizer' s at it again , i see .
check for outstanding ...
roland t. flakfizer ?
that' s him .
thank you very much .
you agree with me , i agree with you .
hold that thought .
i swear , i never touched your daughter .
taxi !
here we go .
get in .
get in .
where to ?
any place with no extradition laws .
and step on it .
right .
mr. roland t. flakfizer ?
that depends .
do i owe you money ?
no .
in a drunken stupor , did i promise to marry you ?
no .
then i' m your man .
lillian oglethorpe wants to see you .
the lillian oglethorpe ?
in her mid 50s , with possible gusts up to 60 , 65 ?
yes .
can you come right away ?
is she still rich ?
by all means .
the oglethorpe place .
big bucks .
yeah , you settle back , i' il get you there safe and sound .
one way street .
don' t worry , this happens a lot .
you enjoy driving a cab ?
no .
as soon as i get me driver' s license , i' m quitting .
a guy' s really gotta haul rump to make ends meet these days .
i mean , apart from the cab , i' m a pool man , i perform liposuction ,
i got me own toupee business .
something that size should have hair on it .
aren' t those numbers clicking by awfully fast ?
you' re probably a speed reader .
well , you got me there .
another two miles and we own this cab .
i hope you brought money .
oh , sure .
i have a wallet just like that .
hey , that is my wallet .
when i get some money , this could come in handy .
such behavior .
stealing another man' s wallet .
you should be ashamed of yourself .
i don' t believe it .
you !
what are you doing ?
do you know who i am ?
a psychotic cab driver ?
i' m rocco melonchek .
i hope you know you' re blowing any possible tip .
you were my attorney in my divorce case ... ... until you started dating my wife during the trial .
and you got the court to double the alimony request she originally made .
you didn' t want her to keep seeing me in cheap motels , did you ?
for god' s sake , man , she was your wife !
help me .
get off .
all right , all right , all right .
five minute break .
all right , break' s over .
wait a minute , wait .
you' re a businessman .
let' s talk business .
fine , and then i' il kill you .
i thought i recognized you .
i' ve been looking for you for the past three years .
you' re lying .
of course i am , but hear me out .
clients are impressed by a law firm with a big staff .
the more employees , the bigger the fees .
so i could use a man like you in my organization .
travel , excitement and a chance for advancement .
of course , you' il start out on the bottom rung .
but work hard and in no time you' il move up to next to the bottom rung .
you got a dental plan ?
lose a tooth , you get two free .
what' s my job ?
you can be my chauffeur .
how much ?
two hundred bucks a week .
600 .
300 .
400 .
800 .
900 .
wait a minute , wait a minute .
shouldn' t i be in this negotiation somewhere ?
350 and not a penny more .
i' il take it .
what happened to 1000 ?
i allowed for taxes .
i want four weeks in advance .
five weeks .
hold it .
i' m giving you one minute to stop this .
two minutes .
five minutes .
seven minutes .
nine minutes .
i' ve stepped into my own private hell .
we' d better get going .
the faster we get to lillian , the quicker i can afford your salaries .
for 350 bucks a week , you drive .
lillian , we really can' t wait any longer .
i suppose you' re right , edmund .
i can' t imagine what is keeping roland .
you guys wait here .
hey , you' re the boss .
the reading of the last will and testament ... ... of oscar winterhaven oglethorpe .
roland !
your royal sex machine .
i wouldn' t come without bringing you a terribly expensive gift .
i hope you like it .
it reminds me of you .
roland , how thoughtful of you .
but i believe i have one just like it .
oh , no problem .
i' il take it back and get the money .
mrs. oglethorpe , you look wonderful .
i could make love to you right here and now .
roland , please .
let' s keep this on a professional level .
very well , then .
i' il charge you 50 bucks a pop .
mr. oglethorpe !
how well i remember him .
gone now , but not forgotten .
i was never crazy about his taste in clothes .
i hope this speech doesn' t seem like a rambling affair , which is something i' m sure we' il be involved in .
oh , lillian , you make me feel just like a natural woman .
i' ve heard enough .
sir , i am appalled .
lillian , who is this man ?
roland , this is mr. edmund lazlo .
a likely story .
just look at him .
he' s obviously after your money and social standing , but i was here first .
hey , how is everyone ?
have you got any mustard in here ?
hey , i' m the boss , remember ?
i told you to wait outside .
today' s my day off .
excuse me .
and just who are you ?
he' s a member of my staff .
lillian oglethorpe , rocco melonchek .
rocco melonchek , lillian oglethorpe .
in order to tell you two apart , one of you will have to wear a mustache .
nice to meet someone else who buys their clothes at big and tall man shops .
i beg your pardon ?
why ?
you can' t help it .
refreshments .
good idea , jacques .
he was so devoted to my husband .
darling oscar is dead now , you know .
well , i hope so .
i understand they buried him .
just make yourself feel at home .
lillian ,
i really do believe we should begin .
oh , yes , yes , certainly .
will you all please find yourselves a seat ?
oh , i beg your ...
the last will and testament of oscar winterhaven oglethorpe .
do you have a bathroom ?
i protest !
this is most irregular !
lillian ...
edmund !
please be careful .
this man is in obviously no condition to carry on .
rocco , will you continue ?
lillian , i ...
right , let' s cut to the payoff here .
blah , blah , blah ...
minnesota holdings , ski boat , ski boat , ski boat ...
yacht ...
to my gay lover , i leave
it was a joke .
i was just joking .
yes .
now .
yes , here we are .
all my worldly goods to be transferred into the care of my wife , lillian .
darling .
" and because of my love for the arts , i request that half my fortune be used to establish a ballet company .
excellent .
wonderful .
nothing like the thrill of spending an evening watching a bunch of anorexics leaping around , guys with bulging genitals ...
i hope i' m not arousing you .
this is all very well and good , but i wouldn' t know the first thing
about running such a company .
mrs. oglethorpe ...
... as your trusted lawyer ...
you can use those words together ? ... and friend ... ... i naturally assumed that task would fall to me .
why would anyone wanna be the head of a ballet company ?
and the director of the company shall receive $500, 000 a year salary .
i' il take the job .
i have ballet running through my veins .
lillian , i' m your man !
outrageous !
i doubt whether he knows the difference between the first , second , third , fourth or fifth positions !
hey , he is strictly missionary position .
i will not allow a rogue like you to handle the oglethorpe ballet .
this document should be treated with the dignity and respect it deserves .
hello !
this is no time for family pictures .
charity work .
i gather these for those less fortunate than ourselves who can' t afford pornography .
edmund !
i demand this man be dismissed immediately !
jacques , you' re working for me now .
for what reason ?
does it make you angry ?
yes !
that' s a good enough reason for me .
lillian , i have a dream .
we' il bring in a whole new breed of ballet goers with innovative giveaways .
leotard nights , wet tutu competitions .
and we' il be the first company performing ballet for the hard of hearing .
we' il have the ballerinas wear wooden shoes .
mrs. oglethorpe , this man doesn' t know what he' s talking about .
now , leave this matter to me and i will sign for you the world' s premier dancer , the great volare .
volare ?
how wonderful .
wait a second !
uno pari mutuel .
not the volare !
you know the great volare ?
i knew him back when he was known as the pretty good volare .
we served in the army together .
he owes me one .
i threw myself on top of an 1 8 year old vietnamese girl and saved his life .
nonsense !
that' s where you' re wrong .
this is nonsense .
lillian , i am the only one who can bring you the world' s greatest male ballerina .
for myself , i ask only a nominal salary , plus a cut of gross receipts , a bonus of 25 percent on anything above break even , a $300 per diem , the use of a company car and housing .
by all means , make my husband' s dream come true .
what , you want him to marry a cheerleader ?
give us a ballet .
oh , this is so exciting .
i can see i am no longer required as the family lawyer .
look , i' m thinking of becoming a lawyer .
can i buy your diploma off you ?
good heavens .
i need you both .
very well , lillian .
as you wish .
for now .
then this evening i' m off to the ballet .
i must shave , shower , get new clothes and practice signing your name .
my pearl ...
i bid you all a fondue .
if you should lose this hand in an industrial accident , keep it for me .
gentlemen !
alan .
i brought this for you .
it' s not exactly a bouquet , but it' s a start .
so sweet .
were you watching the ballet again tonight ?
of course .
i love to watch you dance .
someday we' re gonna be on that stage dancing together .
at the rate i' m going , i' m not so sure .
alan , don' t talk that way .
we agreed that if one of us got into a major company , it could only help the both of us .
tonight i' m going to talk to volare about you .
i would love that .
i mean , no one dances like the great volare .
except you .
catch .
tickets , please ?
no smoking in the theater .
thank you .
my pleasure .
please .
five and six .
eleven .
25 and 67 .
miss !
these seats are dreadful .
they' re facing the stage .
hey , did we miss the coming attractions ?
who' s the bad guy ?
is tom cruise in this ?
do you work out ?
i' m looking for the great volare .
he' s on stage .
and he doesn' t appreciate visitors backstage .
no , no , no , i' m not a visitor .
this is strictly business .
this creep bothering you ?
no .
no .
she' s quite delightful , thank you .
ok , i give up .
how come he doesn' t throw up ?
bravo , mr. volare .
they love you .
that audience wouldn' t know a ballet from a bullfight .
and who are you to speak to me ?
where is my towel ?
when i come off stage , i expect my towel immediately .
do you understand me ?
i' m sorry .
i' m sorry .
fire him .
tina , darling , you were marvelous .
perhaps we should meet in my dressing room after the performance and discuss your career .
i' d like that very much , mr. volare .
thank you .
lisa !
darling , i thought we' d have dinner tonight after the closing night party .
oh , well , thank you , but i' m afraid i' ve already made plans .
mr. volare , i' d like you to meet my friend alan grant .
it' s a privilege to meet you , mr. volare .
i' m a huge fan of yours .
well , alan' s a dancer too , with the performing artists group , the nonprofit ballet troupe .
really ?
how sweet .
it' s a fine idea to keep busy until one is good enough to command a salary .
my cue .
she looked 1 8 , officer , i swear !
too noisy around here .
i' il say .
i got twice the sleep at a julio lglesias concert .
this guy' s gotta get off stage soon .
let' s go back , wait for him , sign him up .
excuse us .
excuse me .
we have to get this plutonium back to the lab .
jacques .
hey .
you know him ?
sure .
he used to drive mr. oglethorpe to the theater ,
then i' d sneak him into the ballet .
i' m gonna be the best man
at their wedding .
i hope so .
excuse me , we didn' t get your name .
oh , my name' s rocco melonchek .
i' m the ballet world' s up and coming manager/ agent .
i' m here to sign a contract with the great volare .
i hate to burst your bubble , but volare already has an agent and manager .
that' s too bad .
any of them real sick ?
you don' t need volare .
what you need is the next great ballet talent .
a young , fresh face .
alan grant .
exactly .
i got it right .
there' s my cue .
jacques , convince mr. melonchek alan' s the person he' s looking for .
this is all well and good , but can he dance ?
could he make millions ?
would he sign a contract for a lot of money , but take scale ,
ieaving his manager with everything else ?
sure he would .
wouldn' t you , alan ?
alan ?
can' t you see he' s watching the woman he adores ?
you' re in love with her , aren' t you ?
you bet .
when' s the wedding ?
there won' t be one ... ... unless i can find a job dancing .
to tell you the truth , mr. melonchek , i' m about out of money and i' m gonna have to go back to minneapolis .
i' il tell you what .
don' t you buy that plane ticket just yet , because i am gonna get you an audition with roland t. flakfizer , ballet director .
you could do that ?
sure .
they' re like this .
well , let' s go to work , mr. melonchek .
i now pronounce us dancer and manager .
yeah !
come in .
tina , darling .
i' m so glad you' ve come .
you were most inspiring tonight .
i can see that under my guidance , your career will soar .
already i can hear the audience roar .
who are you ?
roland t. flakfizer , managing director of the oglethorpe flakfizer ballet company .
you wouldn' t happen to have a plunger on you , would you ?
i beg your pardon ?
oh , i see you have a pretty visitor .
i' il tell you what .
i' il get a girl and we' il double .
you got five minutes , mr. volare .
five minutes ?
my god !
have you consulted another doctor ?
you are out of line .
and you are out of toilet paper .
but we' re still short one girl .
what are you doing here ?
to sign you for my ballet company .
to sign me for your ballet company ?
swear to god , i just said that .
why don' t you run along and let us men talk business .
just leave your phone number and favorite color with the manager and later we' il talk business .
you' re cute , mr ... ?
garvey .
steve garvey .
i think we have something beautiful , you and l .
someday you' il have my children .
in fact , they' re out in the car , if you want them .
oh , god ...
you' re still here ?
i will have you thrown out of the theater .
first , we talk ballet .
i know nothing of your ballet .
we have a lot in common .
i' m managing director and i don' t either .
look , i don' t dance for just anyone .
i am ballet .
my dance shoes are in the louvre in paris .
so what ?
last year , i left a raincoat in cleveland .
do you realize what i was doing at the age of 7 ?
i can imagine .
you must be thankful you didn' t go blind .
i was dancing professionally .
well , whatever you call it : flogging the carrot , polishing the cue stick , choking the chicken , clearing the snorkel ...
but i didn' t come back here to rehash good times .
volare , dance with the oglethorpe flakfizer ballet company and you can name your price .
money is no object .
it isn' t mine .
look , i' m offering you a check for $500, 000 .
it' s made out to volare , great , the .
i don' t dance for the money .
then you dance and i' il keep the money .
look , i will not dance for your ballet and that is final .
a flakfizer doesn' t know the meaning of the word " no .
and we' re a little fuzzy on the word " panagglutinin " and " viscosity .
all right , all right .
let' s sweeten the pot .
the same money ,
we throw in a girl .
no !
then would you object to me getting one ?
i' m a lonely man , mr. volare .
i will give you till the count of ten to get out of here .
one , two , three  before you get stuck somewhere around six , i' il go .
if there' s anything i can ever do for you , forget it .
because i don' t do those kind of things .
and for the last time , i warn you about that highly contagious rash .
i beg you to see to it at once .
hygiene , mr. volare .
hygiene .
mr. flakfizer .
where ? !
i' m sorry , i thought my father showed up .
come here , come here .
did volare accept your offer ?
i didn' t know the meaning of the word " no , " but he had it down pretty good .
you wouldn' t happen to have a world famous dancer stuffed in a drawer somewhere , would you ?
as a matter of fact , i would .
his name' s alan grant .
he can dance rings around volare .
he' s even more talented than gorbachev .
gesundheit .
baryshnikov .
god bless you .
baryshnikov .
hi .
how' s it going ?
how you doing ?
you look very nice today .
he' s one of the best dancers in the country .
hire him for the ballet .
what do you say ?
no , no , nay , nyet .
i have to find some way to sign volare .
when i do that , i' m director of the ballet .
and , gentlemen , that spells cash with a capital ...
k.
you should go back to school .
i hated teaching .
flakfizer , i thought you were smart .
i am smart .
i said no to you , didn' t l ?
i' m offering you two incomes .
your paycheck from the ballet company and then when you sign alan grant to dance , another hefty check as part of alan' s management team .
how do we get this past mrs. oglethorpe ?
relax .
after she sees alan dance , you' ve got nothing to worry about .
except for taxes , depletion of the ozone layer and diseases due to any sexual contact .
that' s a load off my mind .
all you gotta do is convince mrs. oglethorpe to let alan into the charity bazaar .
are you kidding ?
i can charm the pants off of her .
now , that is a disgusting thought .
gentlemen , you' re gonna have to sneak him in .
not so fast .
you know , i worry about you , i really do .
we' re gonna make this legal .
we need a contract .
a binding document , with plenty of loopholes .
exactly .
jacques , draw up the standard contract , would you , please ?
hello , jacques .
we' ve got years to go before we even come close to the japanese .
right .
sign that .
this paper' s blank .
i' il fill it in later .
fair enough .
you' re not gonna cheat me or anything ?
i give you my word as a gentleman .
well , you had me until then .
all right , all right .
fifty fifty split .
now , this is more like it .
what about me ?
to show you no favoritism , rocco and i
will also split your salary fifty fifty .
thanks .
that should keep you out of a higher income bracket .
come to think of it , that should keep you out of any income bracket .
rocco , jacques , tomorrow , alan grant joins the oglethorpe ballet company .
ladies and gentlemen ... ... welcome to the ninth annual oglethorpe charity festival .
let' s go .
it gives me great pleasure to announce the oglethorpe ballet company will be leaving for new york tomorrow , where we ...
you two go and get dressed .
be ready in ten minutes .
t en minutes ?
we' il be ready .
and you' re gonna be a star .
you know , if you keep this up , i may even start to believe it .
nice to have a chance to make someone' s wish come true .
that' s a nice thing to do .
well , how did the market close ?
well , roll over my amalgamated , split my utilities and double my capital venture overlays .
now , call me in an hour and tell me what the hell i' m talking about .
pull over .
everybody all set ?
we' ve got everything so under control , it' s pathetic .
and so is he .
good .
driver , drive on .
look out for that truck !
buffy ...
lillian .
get this thing up on the rack and have it overhauled .
better yet , why don' t you get up on the rack and i' il see you in an hour .
avanti !
here , buffy .
there you are .
darling .
have you come to see mommy ?
what a charming little animal .
do you know dogs , mr. melonchek ?
know dogs ?
i used to be a chef in a korean restaurant .
good food , good friends , good conversation .
roland , i' m so upset volare turned us down .
i know .
what a slap in our collective faces .
like i told you , he has no respect for our ballet .
i wouldn' t want a man like that dancing for me .
or with me , for that matter .
i offered him half the moon .
i keep asking myself , " why didn' t he sign with us ?
because he said he wouldn' t work with you if you were the last person on earth .
what was that ?
nothing .
fetch .
my darling lillian , volare has shunned us .
hold your chins up high , for i have discovered a fabulous young dancer .
a talent that soars .
volare .
it' s volare !
oh , good heavens .
it' s him .
it' s volare .
step back .
step back .
step back .
lillian , permit me to introduce
the great volare .
i' ve seen greater .
signorvolare , i understand you' ve refused to dance with our company .
the truth of the matter is mr. volare won' t work with mr. flakfizer .
but , my dear lillian , i am happy to announce that i have signed mr. volare to dance with and to be the artistic director of the oglethorpe ballet company .
ladies and gentlemen , the overture has started .
overture to what ?
the ballet find of the century .
what ?
roll up !
roll up !
top class ballet , this way !
lillian , just a little surprise i cooked up .
if you don' t like it , it was rocco' s idea .
oh , roland , i love a surprise .
yeah !
yo , rocco , rocco .
mrs. oglethorpe , meet the future world champion of ballet ,
mr. alan grant .
it' s a pleasure .
nice to meet you .
mrs. oglethorpe , i would like to make an announcement .
he' s being deported .
i have found my prima ballerina ...
... the lovely miss lisa le baron .
what ?
well ...
but what about alan ?
shall we say , a most unusual technique .
perhaps better suited to experimental theater .
you can' t talk to my client like that .
if alan isn' t in the company , i won' t be either .
neither will l .
that' s a victory for all mankind .
you' re making a mistake , my dear .
lisa , i agree with volare .
but , alan , we' il be apart for months .
remember when you told me that with you dancing ,
it would be good for both of us ?
yes , but
when volare makes you a star , you can choose anyone to dance with .
dance with the oglethorpe .
come on .
i' il be the proudest guy in the country .
all right .
you' ve made a wise choice , my dear .
then it' s settled .
i am so excited .
you' re excited ?
feel these nipples .
now , lillian , about the directorship of the ballet company ...
oh , yes .
yes , of course , edmund .
you have brought us the great volare .
and dear roland has presented us with our ballerina .
i think it only fair that you and roland share the honor .
flakfizer ?
this is preposterous .
preposterous , is it ?
why don' t we step outside
and settle this like men .
we are outside .
then why don' t we step inside and settle this like women .
or are you afraid , lazlo ?
i' m twice the man you are .
so is she .
and it' s driving me mad .
oh , lillian , can' t you see i' m on fire ?
and you , you contemptible cur !
maybe you don' t want to work for mrs. oglethorpe .
is that so , edmund ?
of course not !
i will do anything that is best for the ballet .
well , there' s no need to commit suicide .
and to show you no hard feelings , how about a cigar .
i don' t smoke .
well , i do .
why don' t you run out and get me one .
and now , since i' m in charge of the ballet , just jamming that thought home , i propose a toast .
champagne !
i' m not going to work with such an uncouth pig .
certainly , mr. volare .
now it' s on to new york !
and a hefty per diem .
good morning .
good morning .
here you go .
here you go .
i' m all out of american currency .
take a fistful of romanian 50s , all right ?
good morning .
good morning , mr. flakfizer .
morning .
good morning , mr. flakfizer .
good morning .
good morning , mr. flakfizer .
good morning .
good morning , mr. flakfizer .
good morning .
good morning , mr. flakfizer .
morning .
good morning , mr. flakfizer .
good morning .
good morning , mr. flakfizer .
the end of another grueling day .
the press conference is to begin in five minutes .
roland seems to be running a little late .
late ?
that charlatan hasn' t been around in weeks .
i don' t know why you put up with him .
he' s never in his office .
he never responds to his calls .
he' s totally irresponsible .
lisa .
relax , my dear .
everyone is nervous their first time .
just follow my lead .
i' m very experienced .
that' s very kind of you , mr. volare .
oh , come on .
call me roberto .
roberto .
lisa , i know an intimate little bistro with a fabulous view of the city .
perhaps dinner and an all night boat ride ?
well , i don' t really think that would be such a good idea
i hope i' m interrupting something .
volare , you know it' s not polite to drool in public .
roland , i haven' t seen you for weeks .
lillian , my pile of sweetness .
i' m so sorry .
i' ve been busy promoting our ballet at beauty pageants .
and then , of course , there' s my volunteer work at the breast implant clinic .
and how i missed you .
in fact , i missed you so much , two days ago i went out and i bought a woman who looks just like you .
oh , you silly .
for you .
from you .
another lovely bracelet .
i didn' t want this wrist to think i was neglecting it .
oh , roland ...
lillian , l
lazlo , i didn' t see you there .
i stand corrected .
i saw you , but i chose to ignore you .
lisa , my darling .
will you excuse us ?
two' s company and three' s an adult movie .
mrs. oglethorpe , may we start ?
oh , please .
is she a fox or what ?
ladies and gentlemen , for many weeks now the oglethorpe ballet company have been in rehearsal .
tomorrow we open with roberto volare' s interpretation of tears of the swan .
at this time , i wish to introduce to you the creative genius behind our company , the brightest light in the ballet firmament ...
thank you for those kind words , edmund lazlo .
i don' t know who does your hair , but tell me , where do they do it and when are they bringing it back ?
well , i had a speech all prepared , but today i' m going to speak from the heart .
you' ve no doubt asked yourself , " why has he been chosen for this task of running the oglethorpe ?
a man' s man .
but i like women a lot more .
my intimate views of jackie , cher , sean , larry , moe , curly .
over 200 pages of provocative pictures , and only one page has any writing on it .
act now and you can get one of these fabulous " flakfizer is ballet " t shirts .
mastercard and visas accepted .
that brings me to the task at hand , to introduce the woman i adore .
behind every great man is a woman .
and thank heaven i have lillian oglethorpe , because , quite frankly ,
i enjoy the shade .
dear lillian , soon i hope to take you on a caribbean cruise , where we can hold hands on a soft summer' s evening and watch that old jamaican moon .
why that old jamaican will be mooning us , i have no idea .
and now , here she is , the woman voted by her senior class
most likely to go up a few dress sizes , " a woman who would be a man , except her name is lillian ,
lillian oglethorpe .
thank you .
thank you .
hey .
hey , what' s with all the tears ?
this should be the happiest night of your life .
i know it should be .
it' s just that ... ... i miss alan so much .
well , i' d feel the same way if the man i loved was thousands of miles away .
of course , i' d be living a whole different lifestyle .
here , come with me .
i know just the thing to cheer you up .
if you just step right in here , my dear , your spirits might just brighten .
but that' s mr. volare' s dressing room .
of course .
he' s got the best champagne .
alan !
lisa .
flakfizer flew alan out to see you in the opening of the ballet .
it' s a formal affair .
do you have tuxedos ?
i got mine .
that' s great for tomorrow , but aren' t you a little overdressed for today ?
oh , no .
i' m very impressed .
i don' t have any luggage .
then this all makes sense .
i was worried there for a second .
mr. flakfizer , thank you .
i see you' re saving your best stuff for alan .
i think we should leave the lovers alone for a few minutes .
make that a few hours .
i missed you so much .
i don' t want us to be apart ever again .
i told you before !
oh , my god , it' s volare .
you better hide .
don' t hang my tight by the crotch !
it throws off my bulge !
yes , volare , i' m sorry .
lisa , what a pleasant surprise .
i see you decided to start our little party early , huh ?
roberto , you' ve got the wrong idea .
oh , no .
i think i' ve got the right idea .
roberto , stop it !
get your hands off of her !
you !
what are you doing here ?
mr. flakfizer flew me out .
you and mr. flakfizer are going to be sorry for this .
volare , what happened ?
it' s flakfizer .
he' s brought that performance artist out here .
hasn' t that information arrived yet ?
no , but we may not need it .
i have devised a little plan .
he' s staying at lillian' s townhouse .
all we have to do is make a few arrangements .
oh , no .
lillian ?
well , no one' s in .
roland .
this is just a business call .
i didn' t think you were back so soon .
roland .
lillian ... ... can' t we just be friends ?
why , you' re not lillian .
you gonna spank me ?
we can start there ... ... and see what happens .
are we alone ?
servants have the day off .
lillian is already at the theater , but i' m here .
take me .
okay .
let' s say two out of three falls .
no standing eight count .
wait .
i wanna make love by candlelight .
i could do you one better .
i think this is more in keeping with ... things to come .
not a bad little pad lillian' s got here .
was that the doorbell ?
that wasn' t you ?
never mind .
just ignore it .
well , it' s a big house .
maybe they can' t hear the bell .
let' s try this .
wait a minute .
i' il be right back .
if you need anything , there' s plenty of batteries in my room .
oh , let me try this .
good idea .
you go through the window .
if the alarm goes off , i' il run away so they won' t catch both of us .
we don' t want any !
oh , it' s you .
we have to talk .
it' s very important .
look .
the next half hour , give or take 29 minutes , will be very important for me , so thanks for dropping by .
yeah , but
flakfizer !
the face is familiar .
it' s mine .
and so it is .
say , if you ever visit this planet again , give me a call .
we' il have lunch .
flakfizer .
how come you didn' t knock ?
i' m using a better grade of gas .
that' s not bad , is it ?
you know , i always enjoy it when we get together , but i want you out , or i' il be forced to kill you .
i' il tell the police
i did it out of love .
flakie , aren' t you coming to bed ?
that' s a girl .
not just a girl , a way of life .
what if mrs. oglethorpe comes back ?
she' il have to wait her turn .
i saw tina first .
don' t you see ?
lazlo wants mrs. oglethorpe to catch you in bed with her !
oh , no !
mrs. oglethorpe !
i' ve been in situations like this before .
we act calm .
stay cool .
okay , okay .
tina leaves by the back door and no one is any the wiser .
it' s an old gary hart trick .
i' m not leaving till i' m satisfied .
you beast !
really has a such a nice light touch with women .
you big brute !
how dare you ...
get her out of sight !
no , no , no !
that' s lillian' s room .
in here .
in here .
not there !
she can' t be found there .
that' s my room .
i don' t know why you insist on returning to my home .
we can' t miss the final dress rehearsal of the ballet .
lillian , my dear , we can' t go without flakfizer .
i just thought it would make for a better appearance if we all arrive at the same time .
you have been looking at your watch all morning , edmund .
your behavior is most peculiar .
you big animal !
what was that ?
we must investigate !
edmund , what is this ?
you relentless sex stallion .
oh , great .
now she' s talking about me .
what was that ?
jacques , show her what will happen if she doesn' t shut up .
that came from your suite .
hide her !
my bedroom ?
ninety eight , 99 , 100 .
lillian , lazlo .
my two favorite l' s .
what on earth are you doing here at this ungodly hour ?
i know you' re up to something , flakfizer .
a snap inspection ?
roland .
what are you doing in my bedroom ?
this is your room ?
thank god .
i thought someone sewed up all my fly holes .
lazlo , how about the three of us going down to the kitchen
and making a big sandwich .
i hardly think so .
i' m going to check under the bed .
edmund !
what on earth has gotten into you ?
be more careful .
you did that on purpose .
you' re trying to conceal the fact that
your suite .
and i think you' re pretty terrific yourself .
you stay here .
there' s no telling what he may do in this crazed state !
lazlo .
i say , lazlo .
what are you looking for ?
a woman .
how about calling an escort service ?
i' m calling the police .
excuse me .
i' m so sorry .
forgive me .
i' m sorry .
the guest bedrooms .
roland .
all right .
get in .
get in .
roland , what is all the commotion ?
it' s lazlo .
i' ve never seen him like this .
quick , in here .
and while you' re in there , why don' t you make the bed .
i know she' s here somewhere .
lazlo !
what ?
what was that ?
i don' t know , but it came from in here .
edmund , this is outrageous .
i can explain .
he' s got a woman tied up .
edmund !
she looks dazed and drugged .
no .
he' s obviously the grand dragon of some sex slave cult .
and she looks like she' s about 1 5 .
no , no , no .
okay , 1 4 , then .
in fact , i know she' s 1 4 because i was dating her a year ago .
edmund , i want you out of my house this instant .
if i had to take a wild guess , i' d say you' re out of a job .
i hope there' s no hard feelings .
you know , lazlo , this is a good look for you .
flakfizer .
lazlo , are you decent ?
lillian .
quick , smelling salts !
and a crane , if you got one .
oh , my goodness .
you' ve done it now , lazlo .
i don' t feel a thing .
this woman is dead .
you' re holding his wrist .
then this man is dead .
mrs. oglethorpe is unconscious .
smelling salts , right away .
hello , excuse me , gentlemen ?
triple speed messenger service .
i got a message here for a guy named lazlo .
give me that .
this is a litany of fraudulent accident cases , bad debts and several police departments who would love to get their hands on you .
and when mrs. oglethorpe comes to , she will read this and she will have no course but to fire you !
quick , try some chloroform .
i' m taking lillian to the hospital .
you , help me get her to the car .
why don' t you take him along for a brain scan .
gently .
easy .
what are we gonna do now ?
what any flakfizer would do .
what , something devious and underhanded ?
you know the family .
if we don' t get that letter before lillian wakes up , we' re dead ducks .
multiple fractures ?
lucky day .
the name' s flakfizer .
no job too small , no fee too large .
if any limb falls off , mail it to me .
it can only strengthen our case .
roland t. flakfizer .
this is your lucky day .
this man' s dead .
then he won' t be needing this .
i' m almost all out of business cards .
excuse me .
what are you gentlemen doing here ?
we' re here to see mrs. lillian oglethorpe .
i' m afraid that' s not possible .
she' s on a private floor .
hospital personnel and doctors only .
hi .
ed breckerman , security .
there' s a mercedes on fire in the doctors ' parking lot .
when will mrs. oglethorpe regain consciousness ?
she' s under a sedative .
you' il have to ask the doctor .
you called ?
at last .
no letter here .
right , i' il carve .
dark meat or white ?
now , this is a very important woman .
i hope you know your business .
hey , so do we .
i wanna assure you we' ve been doctors
for many , many floors now .
you' re not the doctor i saw earlier .
he caught what she got .
we' re filling in .
she' s been out since she came here ?
yes .
and so she hasn' t been able
to read anything , then , huh ?
of course not .
good .
it will bring on complications .
not for her , necessarily ,
but complications nonetheless .
she' s coming to , doctor .
now we got complications .
she' s going out , doctor .
the crisis is over .
this is ludicrous .
i don' t think anyone will argue that point .
let the games begin .
it' s the first annual vasectomy bowl .
what is going on ?
a happy doctor is a good doctor .
what is the meaning of this ?
are you sure you' re a doctor ?
that' s gotta hurt .
at least , i hope it does .
doctor , we' il have to run a few tests .
table for one .
there you go .
ground transportation , courtesy of medicare .
you say ether and i say either ether , either
oh , please proceed .
i' m just checking on mrs. oglethorpe .
well , doctor ?
yes , doctor ?
yes , doctor ?
doctor .
doctor .
yes .
well , i thought we' il have to perform a full " rectumology .
an epidemic .
drop those pants .
not you , the patient .
i thought you were cardiologists .
they' re all connected .
we enter the rectum and head north .
why do you think we have such long instruments ?
x rays for dr. blazie .
i' il take those .
i deal in x rays .
i see you do too .
i used to work at las vegas general .
security to room 1 404 .
yeah .
hit me .
i' il play these .
read them and weep .
three hearts .
beats a pair of kidneys .
doctor , your diagnosis ?
difficult to tell from the negative .
it' s her liver .
looks more like veal to me .
what is this ?
an obstruction in the fourth lumbar .
huge backup in the lower intestine .
my advice is to avoid the intestine and plan an alternate route .
grab a left at the first major artery and get on the fifth lumbar heading south .
skeletal update every hour on the hour .
time for a thorough checkup .
it' s gotta be here somewhere .
the operation is a success !
success .
success .
doctors , we' re done here .
arrest those men .
come here .
come on , man .
what are you doing ?
come on .
come here .
stay still , all right ?
so you were the doctors .
no , we' re not them .
we' re someone else .
the three you' re looking for are our twin brothers .
you' il never see us together , because we love the same women .
that' s next on geraldo .
roland .
yes ?
what are you doing here ?
that' s a good question .
what am i doing here ?
lmpersonating a doctor , harassing a patient , altering medical records .
trespassing , destroying hospital property .
and don' t forget alan punching out volare .
whose side are you on anyway ?
give me that .
stealing private property .
it could happen to anyone .
society' s to blame .
too much violence in the movies .
it' s my environment .
we were carrying out orders !
it' s the japanese .
they' re buying up everything .
did we leave anything out ?
could i have a personalized number ?
is my hair okay ?
empty your pockets .
you can make one call .
hello , sportsline ?
steamer , hi .
this is rocco .
am i on the air ?
give me that .
be careful with that .
do you know who this man is ?
this is jackson pollock jr . , son of roy lichtenstein .
in a few years , this could be worth millions .
nobody knows the trouble i' ve seen
nobody knows my sorrow
what' s it all about , alfie ?
is it just for the moment we live ?
what' s it all about when you sort it out , alfie ?
in the jungle , the mighty jungle , the lion sleeps tonight
in the jungle , the quiet jungle , the lion sleeps tonight
hey .
you got visitors .
maybe it' s somebody
with a recording contract .
alan .
lisa .
you can go home , fellas .
you bribed a guard ?
i paid your bail .
how did you do that ?
i used my severance pay .
you have servants ?
no .
volare fired me .
it seems i wasn' t appreciative enough .
he can' t do that .
no , he' s done it , all right .
and now he' s dancing with lisa' s understudy .
the one with the large chest ?
there' s nobody in the company like that .
would be if i were running things .
this is terrible .
and volare' s vowed to blackball us from ever dancing for a major ballet company .
that' s not fair .
i know .
and it' s all my fault .
oh , it' s your fault , huh ?
alan , don' t talk that way .
why , i wouldn' t dance with volare if he were the last man on earth .
wait a minute .
just because you' re not in the ballet doesn' t mean you won' t dance tonight .
flakfizer' s right .
i don' t know why , but he' s right .
and i think it' s about time for alan to make his new york debut .
to the theater , and not a minute to lose !
break a leg , mr. volare .
grazie .
tina , darling .
break a leg , mr. volare .
grazie .
break a leg , mr. volare .
grazie .
five minutes , mr. volare .
five minutes ?
oh , my god .
what have i been doing ?
four minutes , mr. volare .
four minutes ?
three minutes , mr. jolson .
what' s going on here ?
where do you want these , mr. volare ?
anywhere .
just keep them out of my way .
all right .
come on .
hurry up .
get out of here .
go .
hey , you too .
you too .

where do you want these , mr. volare ?
what' s going on here ? !
how do i know ?
have you lost your mind ?
lobstergram for mr. volare .
lobstergram !
oh , there you are .
for he' s a jolly good fellow for he' s a jolly good fellow
for he' s a jolly good fellow
a masseuse !
lazlo !
mr. volare is coming .
places , please .
t onight is your night , my dear .
thanks to you , edmund .
after the performance ,
i will announce you as the sole director of our ballet company .
if i do say so myself , the ballet is in good hands .
how could i ever have trusted someone as nefarious as roland flakfizer ?
i don' t wish to hear his name mentioned ever again .
edmund .
it' s those idiots !
i will put a stop to this .
good evening , ballet fans .
we' ve got a good one .
another big league ballet battle starring that plucky roberto " bulldog " volare .
and what a great night for a ballet it is .
the sky is clear , the wind is blowing from left to right , which means the ballerinas should be flying out of here .
and here we go .
volare does a pirouette , another pirouette .
a skip , a leap .
he spins .
he scores !
listen to that crowd !
it' s him !
we return you now to your regularly scheduled program .
come here .
get the police now !
hi .
get out !

hold it .
the great volare ?
bon voyage .
no !
all right , yeah .

roland , what is happening ?
ballet history .
when do we go on ?
i' d say right about now .
there they are !
arrest those men !
don' t let them get away !
oh , boy .
i will never work for the oglethorpe ballet again !
will you put that in writing ?
this evening could ruin my career !
at least we' re thinking along the same lines .
i must explain to my public this is all your doing .
they' re trying to tell you something .
i quit !
that' s what they' re trying to tell you .
officers , take these people away .
oh , my god , he' s got a gun !
the man' s insane .
he could use a gift certificate to the betty ford center .
we' il have lunch right after the lobotomy .
always remember , nobody likes you .
bravo !
bravo !
wonderful .
wonderful !
we' re a hit !
go on , get back out there .
get back out there .
listen to that crowd !
you' re a ballet legend .
and you' re not even dead yet .
oh , roland , i' m so glad i trusted you .
rest assured , my darling , i will never leave your side again .
what' s that ?
nothing .
hey , what happened ?
i got an idea .
hey , big boy .
come here .
yes .
oh , boy .
