i' m , uh , jerry lundegaard .
you' re jerry lundegaard ?
yah .
shep proudfoot said shep said you' d be here at 7 : 30 .
what gives , man ?
shep said 8 : 30 .
we' ve been sitting here an hour ?
he' s peed three times already .
oh , i' m sure sorry .
shep told me 8 : 30 .
it was a mix up , i guess ?
you got the car ?
yah , you bet .
it' s out in the lot there .
brand new burnt umber ciera .
yeah , okay ?
well , sit down , then .
i' m carl showalter .
this is my associate gaear grimsrud .
yeah , how you doin ' ?
so
we all set on this thing , then ?
sure , jerry .
we' re all set ?
why wouldn' t we be ?
yeah no , i' m sure you are .
shep vouched for you and all .
i got every confidence here in you fellas .
i guess that' s it , then ?
here are the keys .
no , that' s not it , jerry ?
hah ?
the new vehicle plus $40, 000 .
yeah , but the deal was the car first , then the 40, 000 , like as if it was the ransom .
i thought shep told ya .
shep didn' t tell us much , jerry ?
well , okay .
except that you were gonna be here at 7 : 30 .
yeah , well , that was a mix up , then ?
yeah , you already said that .
yeah , but it' s not a whole pay in advance deal .
see , i give you a brand new vehicle in advance , and then i' m not gonna debate you , jerry .
okay .
i' m not gonna sit here and debate .
i will say this , though .
what shep told us didn' t make a whole lotta sense .
oh , no .
it' s real sound ?
it' s all worked out .
you want your own wife kidnapped .
yeah .
you
my point is , you pay the ransom what , 80, 000 bucks ?
i mean , you give us half the ransom , 40, 000 .
you keep half .
it' s like robbin ' peter to pay paul .
it doesn' t make any sense .
okay .

or your fucking wife , jerry .
well , it' s all part of this
they don' t know i need it , see .

it' s my deal here , see .
jerry , we thought you were bringing us an investment .

can i see your license and registration ?
certainly .
yeah , i was gonna tape up those the tag .
you know , to be in full compliance , but , uh

my license and registration .
yeah , i wanna be in compliance .
i was just thinking we could take care of it right here ...
in brainerd .
put that back in your pocket , please , and step out of the car , please , sir .

it' s in the head and the hand there .
i guess that' s a defensive wound ?
oh , yah ?
where' s the state trooper ?
back there a good piece in the ditch next to his prowler .
okay .
so we got a trooper pull someone over , we got a shooting , these folks drive by , there' s a high speed pursuit , ends here , and then this execution type deal .
yah .
i' d be very surprised if our suspect was from brainerd .
yah .
and i' il tell ya what .
from his footprint , he looks like a big fella .
you see somethin ' down there , chief ?
no .
i just think i' m gonna barf .
jeez .

it' s just morning sickness .

yah ?
yeah .
now i' m hungry again .
you have breakfast yet , margie ?
oh , yah .
norm made some eggs ?
yah ?

what now do you think ?
let' s go take a look at that trooper .
there' s different footprints here , lou ?
yah ?
yah .
this guy' s smaller than his buddy .
oh , yah ?
for pete' s sake ?
how' s it look , marge ?
well , he' s got his gun on his hip there , and ...
he looks like a nice enough guy .
tsk ?
it' s a real shame .
yah .
didn' t monkey with his car there , did ya ?
no way .
well , somebody shut his lights .
i guess the little guy sat in there , waiting for his buddy to come back .
yeah , it would' ve been cold out here .
heck , yeah ?
you think is dave open yet ?
dave ?
oh , you don' t think he' s mixed up in
oh , no , no .
i just wanna get norm some night crawlers .
did you look in his citation book ?
yeah .
last vehicle he wrote in ...
was a tan ciera at 2 : 18 a . m .
under plate number , he put " d. l. r.
i figure they stopped him or ...
shot him before he could finish filling out the tag number ?
uh huh .
so i got the state looking for a ciera with a tag startin ' d. l. r.
they don' t got no match yet .
i' m not sure that i agree with you 100 % ...
on your police work there , lou .
yah ?
yah .
i think that vehicle there probably had dealer plates .
d. l. r. ?
oh .
jeez .
say , lou .
d' you hear the one about the guy couldn' t afford personalized plates ...
so he went and changed his name to " j3l 2404 " ?
yah ?
that' s a good one .
look , alls i know is , you got a problem , you call a professional !
no !
they said no cops ?
they were darn clear on that , wade .
they said , " you call your cops , and we' re gonna shoot
of course they' re gonna say that !
where' s my protection ?
they got jean here .
i give these sons of bitches $1 million , where' s my guarantee they' re gonna let her go ?
well , they $1 million is a lot of damn money .
yeah , but think this there they are .
they got my daughter .
think this thing through here , wade .
you give ' em what they want , why won' t they let her go ?
you gotta listen to me on this one , wade .
ah , heck ?
you don' t know .
you' re just whistling dixie here .
i' m sayin ' the cops , they can advise us on this .
i' m sayin ' call a professional ?
no !
no cops !
that' s final .
this is my deal here , wade .
jean is my wife here .
i gotta tell you , wade .
i' m leaning to jerry' s viewpoint here .
well we gotta protect jean .
these
we' re not holding any cards here , wade .
they got ' em all , so they call the shots .
you' re darn tootin ' ?
ah , damn it !
i' m tellin ' ya ?
well , why why don' t we
stan , i' m thinkin ' we should offer ' em a half million , okay ?
now , come on here !
no way , wade !
no way !
we' re not horse tradin ' here , wade ?
yeah .
we gotta just bite the bullet on this thing ?
yeah .
so , uh , what' s the next step here , jerry ?
they' re gonna call me up and give me instructions for a drop .
i' m supposed to have the money ready tomorrow ?
damn it !
how was everything today ?
yah .
real good , now .
how you doin ' ?
okay .
now , we' il get the money together .
don' t worry about it , jerry .
now , do you want anyone at home with ya till they call ?
no .
i they don' t want
they were just supposed to be dealing with me .
they were real clear .
yeah ?
you know , they said no one listenin ' in .
they' il be watchin ' , you know .
maybe it' s all bull , but like you said , stan , they' re callin ' the shots .
okay .
now , is , uh , is scotty gonna be all right ?
yeah , jeez , scotty .
yeah .
i' il go talk to him .
how you doin ' there , scotty ?
dad , what are they doin ' ?
what do you think they' re doin ' with mom ?
it' s okay , scotty .
they' re not gonna wanna hurt her any .
these men , they they just want money .
yeah , what if somethin ' goes wrong , dad , and then no , no .
nothing' s goin ' wrong here ?
granddad and i , we' re , um
we' re makin ' sure this gets handled right .
i really think we should call the cops here .
no , no .
no one can know about this thing .
we gotta play ball with these guys .
you ask stan grossman , he' il tell you the same thing .
yeah , but , dad we' re gonna get mom back for ya , but we gotta play ball , you know ?
that' s the deal here .

struggling with the narcotics , some other entanglements , currently on parole .

well , associating with criminals , if you' re the one they talked to , that right there would be a violation of your parole .
would end you up back in stillwater .

i know you don' t wanna be an accessory to something like that .
so , you think you might remember who those folks were who called ya ?
