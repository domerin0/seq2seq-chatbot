not the part of d. c. you' re familiar with .
i work in a neighborhood so bad , you can get shot while you' re getting shot .
around here when people have a problem , they don' t call the mayor , they call me .
miss pearl !
what' s going on ?
dionne is in the house .
i know she is .
i don' t know what she' s talking about .
we checked the house , nobody is in there .
hey , man , dionne is her cat .
whatever .
cats got nine lives .
she' il be fine .
can we let one guy go in and help this lady get her cat ?
can' t do it .
once they laid the explosives , there' s nothing i can do .
she just showed up .
you took the lady' s house .
can you at least let her get her cat ?
we didn' t take it , we gave her $40, 000 .
what kind of house is she supposed to get with $40, 000 ?
a crack house ?
i think she' d be happy to get out of this rattrap .
who are you to call this place a rattrap ?
this is my neighborhood , where i' m from .
i got my first bike stolen right there .
my daddy got his bike stolen right there .
when i have a son , i hope he' s fortunate enough to get stuck up right there .
can' t you let somebody go check ?
we already looked .
there' s nothing in there .
we got work to do .
leave the people alone , damn it !
let' s get this thing going .
come on .
stop being in such a hurry .
we' ve been here all morning .

miss pearl , we got to get out of here .
they' re going to blow this place up .
they wouldn' t do that , baby !
they know we' re in here .
i love you , i' ve known you a long time .
you' ve seen a lot in your life .
you' ve seen churches burnt to the ground , dogs sicced on kids ... you' ve seen malcolm x and jfk killed .
they shut up muhammad ali and richard pryor .
they gave magic johnson alds , turned michael jackson white .
do you really think these people give a damn about you ?
we interrupt the jay z song to bring you this special bulletin .
presidential candidate senator gaines ... and his running mate , general olson james ... were both killed when their planes crashed into each other .
we now return you to the jay z song already in progress .
what' s up ?
trying to be like you , hero !
what' s up , man ?
saving kittens ?
don' t steal my car now .
i don' t want that garbage .
what will i do , feed your car to my car ?
let me get ten nine lives , four lucky ducks , two straight pokers ... three crabpots and five powerballs .
thank you , here you go .
you all need to stop .
why are all these people clapping ?
you didn' t see me on the news ?
no , i didn' t .
i got meat !
more beef than east coast , west coast rap .
check it out !
superman !
saving lives and stuff .
why don' t you cop one of these pork chops ?
know what you need to do ?
you need to leave .
i won' t tell you again .
nobody wants your meat .
who the hell wants to buy stolen meat ?
i' il take a t bone .
you like gizzards , too ?
did you hear about that guy running for president ?
who will replace him ?
maybe they should get shaq .
nobody can beat him .
are you getting gas ?
you' re holding my line up .
yeah , i' m sorry . $10 on three .
you' ve got a lot of nerve hanging up on me .
hanging up ?
what' s going on ?
i' m leaving you !
that' s what' s going on .
the only reason i accepted this engagement ring from you in the first place ... is because i thought you had potential !
i thought you wanted more !
why can' t you just play the game ?
wear a suit !
be a real politician !
what' s my clothes have to do with ....
are you seeing somebody else ?
i' m seeing everybody else !
i' ve met mosquitoes with more force than you .
i' m tired of your little games , tired of being your little secretary .
here' s the light bill .
i didn' t pay it .
here' s the cable bill .
i didn' t pay that , either .
and here' s the bill for your car note .
i hope they take it !
wait a minute , that' s my car !
wait , come back !
i hate that piece of shit !
i' m tired of spending my time waiting for you to quit acting like a child ... and act like a grown man for a change , mays !
i need to get on with my life !
i want a house , i want children !
i want to go on vacation !
you' re horrible in bed !
i am tired of being engaged .
i am tired of being
i wish you would .
for the last time , i' m not running for president .
i' m not crazy !
gaines was 20 points behind .
it' s ten weeks to election day .
damn it !
they should have known better than to talk on a cell phone in a plane .
what about sanderson ?
that' s a joke .
lewis has been vice president for eight years .
he' s a war hero and sharon stone' s cousin .
he can' t lose .
what about mosley ?
girls .
connelly ?
boys .
mcmasters ?
big boys .
so we concede the election to lewis ?
nobody is talking about conceding , debra , but let' s get real here .
we' il lose this one .
the thing to do is to set the party up for the next election .
we need a candidate that will put on a good show .
this isn' t a circus , it' s a presidential election .
you can' t just pick some guy ... to run for president .
it' s unprecedented , but if i put in a call to the party chairman ... we find a candidate , he' il back him .
who will run a race they know they can' t win ?
who says he has to know ?
what the ....
what now ?
no , not my bike !
when i went in there i wasn' t thinking about being a hero .
i was just trying to help miss pearl .
miss pearl .
i think we found our man .
look at this !
this is great !
this is america , see ?
little guy against the big guy , corporations against the people .
young versus old .
what' s better than this ?
give me a break !
i am going to run an alderman for president ?
he' s not an alderman .
he' s a hero .
who doesn' t like a hero ?
big business loves a hero !
see ?
you said we needed somebody who can help the party .
now , how in the hell does this guy help the party ?
i' m glad you asked .
the united states is changing .
america is changing .
lnside of 20 years , you know the numbers ... 20 percent black , 21 percent asian , 39 percent hispanic .
the minorities will be the majority .
the smartest thing we can do ... is be the first party to nominate a minority for president .
how about a cripple ?
i don' t think so , charlie .
now , we' il lose , of course , but the minorities will be happy .
the minorities will be happy and they will vote for us in 2008 ... because we' ve shown we support them .
and the white people will vote for us ...
because our guy isn' t black .
you got my vote !
geller , see if you can track down this mays gilliam .
go check our accounts .
give me one good reason why i should go along with this .
don' t you get it , debra ?
i intend to run for president in 2008 .
now give me one reason why you shouldn' t .
he would take a lot of work .
we can run a background check ... but it' s obvious he' s not a party line candidate .
he' s just some kid who thinks he can make a difference .
don' t worry .
go out there , put the machine behind him .
you get 25 points in the polls , consider it a win .
make sure he doesn' t embarrass us .
after this is over , we get to work .
when i' m president , i' il take care of you .
help me .
they locked me out of my office .
i know .
the mayor is fed up with you .
how many times have i told you ?
you got to quit trying to fix shit .
i could' ve got you into the council next term .
now you' re red lined .
shannon is taking over your district .
they need to smooth over the mall situation , that bus thing is heating up .
they don' t trust you .
i' m not the one stealing people' s houses .
that' s what your problem is .
you got to work with us .
that shit you pulled over there cost the city money .
makes the mayor look bad .
now , contrary to popular belief , politics is no place to express yourself .
you want to get in , you got to fit in .
and look at you .
grow up , you got to dress better .
even puff daddy wears a suit to court .
i' m sorry , brother , but ain' t nothing i can do .
nice car .
ain' t it , though ?
got it for a song at a repo auction .
he feels bad , mighty low
got nowhere to go
what can you do when you' re feeling low
man , i want to know
he feels bad , mighty low got nowhere to go
what can you do when you' re feeling low
and your car just got repo' d
here we are .
mays gilliam , debra lassiter .
nice to meet you .
take a seat .
we know what happened today .
we know you lost your job .
how do you know that ?
it just happened .
we' re the government .
we know everything .
we' d like you to do something for us .
sure , i' d love to work on a presidential campaign .
i' il make phone calls , send out fliers .
who have you guys chosen to run against lewis ?
that' s exactly what we wanted to talk to you about .
we' d like you to run for president .
of what ?
the united states .
of what ?
of america .
which america ?
north ...
america , mays .
get out of here !
we' re not joking .
we want you to be the nominee for the office of president ... of the united states of america .
let me get this straight .
you guys couldn' t find anybody else to run ?
you couldn' t find nobody ?
something is wrong here .
you couldn' t find a congressman ... a senator ?
i' m just an alderman .
congressmen , senators , they work with other politicians .
you' re an alderman .
you work with the people .
and that' s what we want , a man of the people .
this is a big joke , right ?
they' ve got a hidden camera somewhere .
you all will get a big laugh out of this .
you know what ?
i don' t care .
one of you all will drive me home because my bike is messed up .
you an american ?
are you an american ?
yes .
this isn' t just an election .
it' s a moment .
this is the moment when you have the opportunity to show boys and girls ... men and women , what america is about .
look at that .
when i see that , i think of our forefathers fighting to make this country what it is .
when i see it i think about the guy who has to scrub lincoln' s balls for minimum wage .
that' s why we want you .
you care about the little people .
what will it be ?
it gives me great honor ... to accept the party' s nomination ... for president ... of the united states of america .
no !
welcome to your campaign headquarters .
these folks will do everything they can to help you get elected .
these are your people .

people would be cheering if i read the recipe for corn bread .
it' s not working .
i' m only one point up in the polls .

vice president brian lewis still holds a commanding 84 percent .
six percent are undecided , saying ... they don' t know who they' re voting for , they just know it' s not gilliam .
when you get out there , listen to the crowd .

they had a speech written for me ... about what the people need .
but you guys are the people .
you know what you need .
better schools ... better jobs ...
less crime .
how many of you , right now ... work two jobs just to have enough money to be broke ?
that ain' t right .
lf you work two jobs , and at the end of the week ... you got just enough money to get your broke ass home ...
let me hear you say , " that ain' t right !
that ain' t right !
how many of you have children that they call stupid ?
don' t be ashamed !
it ain' t your fault .
i asked my niece the other day , " what' s four plus four ? " she said , " 44 .
but that ain' t her fault !
that' s the school' s fault .
lf your child' s school has old ass books ... and brand new metal detectors , let me hear you say , " that ain' t right !
that ain' t right !
it ain' t right .
and now we got these corporations stealing all the money .
they ain' t stealing their money , they stealing our money !
the pension .
you work for 35 years .
you thought you' d leave your kids a will , now you' il leave them a won' t !
you show up to get your pension , they give you a pen !
a damn pen !
what in the hell am i supposed to do with a pen ?
i should stab you in the neck with this pen , mr. pension taker .

meanwhile , we steal a big mac with cheese ... next thing you know , we on death row !
that ain' t right !
how many of you work in a city you can' t afford to live in ?
that ain' t right !
how many of you work in a mall you can' t afford to shop in ?
that ain' t right !
how many of you clean up a hotel ... you ain' t never gonna be able to stay in ?
that ain' t right !
we got nurses that work in hospitals they can' t even afford to get sick in .
it ain' t right !
it isn' t right !
that shit is wrong !
it' s dead wrong !
i' m mays gilliam ... and i' m running for president of the united states of america .

and you said " shit .
presidential candidates do not say " shit .
show me a man that' s never said shit , i' il show you someone full of shit !
debra , hold on .
what you just did , that was great .
maybe you' re right .
we could tailor the speeches more to you .
my speeches ?
come on , did you hear them ?
lf this is gonna work , it' s got to fit me .
it' s got to be my campaign .
this is not your campaign .
you do what i tell you to , or you' il be back in d. c. on your bicycle .
i' m the one running for president .
lf we' re gonna run this campaign , it' s got to go my way .
we' re gonna do it the way i want it done .
hold on .
i don' t know if that' s such a good idea .
lf you don' t know , you better ask somebody .
after a slow start , mays gilliam has made some dramatic changes ... in his presidential campaign .
hi .
i' m mays gilliam , candidate for president of the united states .

mays gilliam is turning the establishment on its ear ... with his new controversial campaign ads .
lf you love america , vote mays gilliam for president .
paid for by citizens for mays gilliam .
the part of mays gilliam' s security director ... will now be played by muhammad muhammad muhammad .
childcare is one of the most important issues facing this country today .
the working mother has to take her child to a nanny .
the nanny has to take her child to a babysitter .
the babysitter has to take her child to daycare .
on the count of three , i want everybody to take care of their own damn kids !
whose baby is this ?
it ain' t mine !
gay people want what every american wants .
a good house , a good job !
i believe in gay rights because when i see gay people ... all i' m seeing are people , normal people like every other american .

he feels good things are going his way
he just might be the president someday
mays , darling , i' ve been thinking .
i want a small wedding .
i think i want 150 , maybe 200 people .
i' ve always said i wanted a wedding in a church ... but lately i' ve been thinking about the botanical gardens .
we could do it by the tulips .
it' il be beautiful
security !
who the hell is mays gilliam ?
he' s running against you , sir .
what happened to gaines ?
he died in a plane crash .
get out of here !
gaines is dead ?
don' t you remember ?
it was on the news !
not my news .
this fellow , gilliam , is an alderman from d. c.
he took gaines ' place , sir .
i' m running against this guy .
yes , sir .
that is some bullshit .
this is my time .
i' ve been vice president for eight years .
i am a war hero , and i am sharon stone' s cousin !
and i' il be damned if i' m going to let my election be ruined by this asshole !
i want this guy done .
you hear me ?
finish him !
he will be destroyed , sir , as you wish .
this is the white house without mays gilliam .
peaceful , isn' t it ?
now , this is the white house if gilliam is elected .
let' s keep mays gilliam out of the white house .
vote brian lewis for president .
it' s your last chance .
how do you want to handle this ?
i don' t want to go negative .
nobody wants to hear that .
i want people to vote for me , not against lewis .
people don' t know what they want to hear .
we have to respond .
we should go with something measured , accurate .
let' s call him on his record !
you can' t challenge his record when mays doesn' t have one .
how about a massage ?
ladies and gentlemen ... please welcome presidential candidate mays gilliam .
thank you !
this is conservative talk 520 .
you' re listening to big dave .
negative ads .
lewis is up , gilliam is down .
i think it' s great !
i don' t think i want gilliam and his homies to be in the white house .
people are saying these ads are dirty politics .
give me a small break !
we' re not talking about running a rib shack but a country !
he' s running for president and every vote counts !
ladies and gentlemen , mays gilliam !
and if these ads are so bad , why hasn' t gilliam said anything ?
howard stern rocks !
you' re on with big dave .
the reason gilliam hasn' t responded is because he has too much integrity .
we just got endorsements from raekwon the chef ... and ghostface killah .
ls this good ?
it' s great .
where are we on this running mate thing ?
i' ve been making calls .
nobody wants to run with you .
who did you call ?
everybody .
did you call hammer ?
no , i did not call hammer .
then you didn' t call everybody .
mr. gilliam , can i have your autograph ?
i' il be right back .
should we call hammer ?
no .
say cheese !
mays gilliam did not attend this year' s annual rally against cancer .
ls mays gilliam for cancer or against cancer ?
mays gilliam , he' s for cancer .
vote brian lewis for president .
it' s your last chance .
cancer lover !
no , he does not get away with this crap !
this is what we' il do .
you ever watch bugs bunny ?
bugs would always shoot elmer fudd in the face and drop an anvil on his head .
but what made elmer really mad is when bugs bunny kissed him .
we got to kiss this bitch .
how do you propose we do that ?
watch this .
i' m a klansman .
i hate niggers , jews , and fags , but i love brian lewis .
yo , what' s up ?
i' m osama bin laden .
i hate america , but i love brian lewis .
paid for by osama bin laden .
sharon stone is a defector .
that' s what lewis campaign insiders are saying about the hollywood star ... and cousin of vice president lewis , after stone' s endorsement of mays gilliam .
i don' t believe it !
yeah !
i know !
did you hear ....
what are you doing here ?
gilliam is over 30 points .
that means even if he loses he' s the frontrunner in 2008 .
ln case you' ve forgotten , i intend to run for president in 2008 ... and i am not running against him .
so this is over .
either you put a stop to it or i will .
i came on board to run a campaign for a man we didn' t expect to win ... not to sabotage him so he' d lose .
you' re in this as thick as i am .
of course he' s supposed to lose !
that' s why we picked him .
are you with me or are you with him ?
i thought you wanted what was best for the party .
i' m what' s best for the party !
what' s the matter ?
democracy doesn' t work for you when you' re not winning ?
i' m with him .
i' m with him ?
who are these people again ?
the urban business board .
what are your plans for social security ?
give it to old people .
your plans on global warming ?
global ice tea .
you the man !
you the woman !
i want to introduce you to chester norris allen .
he owns a bottling plant in d. c. and i spoke to him about our problem .
we' ve got a nice check for you .
we can' t take it .
you sell malt liquor to kids .
i do no such thing .
come on , man .
it' s orange beer with a nipple top .
now , who' s that for ?
it' s crib malt liquor , man !
he' s unbelievable !
damn it , we need that money !
why do you make everything so difficult ?
it' s crib malt liquor !
crib malt liquor , just like mama used to make " ?
whose mama ?
not my mama !
the situation is getting tense with the threat of the bus line being shut down .
protestors took their concerns to transit officials ... but talks broke down when the newly appointed alderman , reginald shannon ... was punched in the face by an angry protestor .
good evening , sir .
what' s up , nikki ?
i noticed you weren' t at the party , so i thought ... if there is anything you would like for me to do , i would be happy to .
could i ask you something ?
yes .
you seem like a nice girl .
how did you get into this line of work ?
i went to the university of nebraska ... where i majored in theater and communications .
i did some extra work , and a few things that went straight to video .
okay .
can i ask you a question ?
yeah , sure .
since i' ve been here , you haven' t really given me any assignments .
i was wondering if you find me attractive .
i think you' re ....
i think you' re very attractive .
it' s just that ...
i like to get to know people before i get involved .
i don' t mean to be out of line , sir ... but are you ?
am i what ?
trying to get to know somebody .
it is late , i' m out of here .
you need to take a cab .
i' il be fine .
i' m just gonna walk .
take a cab !
i' il be fine .
i' il walk .
need a ride ?
where are we going ?
i just thought i' d give you a little tour .
lf you look over there , it' s the lincoln memorial .
lincoln freed the slaves ... but before he did it , he said , " first you niggers got to build me a statue .
right there is the jefferson memorial .
jefferson had a black mistress .
he said , " all men are created equal , but black women got the nicest ass !
that' s the treasury .
lf you look real hard in the window , you can see oprah counting her money .
$20 trillion one , $20 trillion two ....
hi , oprah !
what' s it like ... traveling all over the country and meeting all those people ?
i like it .
i like traveling , i like meeting the people .
but sometimes , you don' t know if people like you for you .
know what i mean ?
i like you for you .
and i think you' re okay .
just okay ?
i' m just playing .
i forgot how nice d. c. was .
i' m always working .
i never get a chance to check it out .
maybe you need to take advantage of what' s in front of you .
you never know , you may look up someday , and it might not be there .
freeze !
put your hands up in the air and step away from mr. gilliam !
it' s okay !
what the hell are you doing ?
what the hell are you doing ?
you can' t go dashing off in the middle of the night with some girl .
something' s happened .
we got to pack and get out of here !
somebody make sure she gets home safely .
we have a plane waiting for us .
ln florida today , guns and explosives were found at a junior high school .
no one was injured in the incident , but with just six weeks till election day ... this could be a hot button issue for both parties .
now , back to the jay z song already in progress .
muhammad , get me a gun in case another kid tries to get crazy .
this could work in our favor .
florida is a big second amendment state .
this is serious .
this is not the player' s ball .
you can cut into lewis ' numbers .
talk about the kids , not about the guns .
lf i get shot , everybody is fired .
one question here .
there' s been an outcry that something needs to be done about school violence .
what do you plan to do about this ?
i feel we need to talk to our kids ....
excuse me .
hello , children .
good morning .
pay attention .
bullshit 101 .
ladies and gentlemen , our american children are hurting today ... and we need to reach out to them ... and give them all a good old fashioned american hug .
god bless america !
and no place else .
thank you .
thank you , children .
no more bombs now .
and don' t use guns .
that went well .
very touching .
the kids liked me .
you were very genuine .
they responded .
i tried to hug a girl and a boy so i wouldn' t seem sexist .
mr. vice president !
welcome to the show , alderman gilliam .
surprised you' re not somewhere with your girlfriend .
how do you know about her ?
i' m the government .
i know everything .
we really should debate .
let' s get something straight .
i don' t know you , and i don' t like you .
party' s over .
i' m fixing to whip your ass .
you got it ?
sir , we really should debate .
god bless america , and no place else .
sir , we just got this off the uplink .
what is it ?
an off the record comment by mays gilliam .
bad ?
yes , sir .
good work .
it' s on !
guys , come here ! ... lewis was on the scene comforting parents and students .
the press is in lewis ' back pocket .
ln this cnb news exclusive , our cameras caught gilliam ... making what was arguably the most controversial statement of the day .
they act like us .
we' re bombing countries all the time .
lf i was 12 , i' d have a gun , too .
tell me you didn' t say that .
i didn' t know the camera was on me .
i was playing around with some sound guy .
you didn' t know the camera was on you ?
of course it' s on you .
it' s always on you !
you' re running for president !
i told you ....
this is all your fault !
gilliam is under investigation by the fbl ... for his involvement with this man ... friend and associate and accused drug lord , warren pryor .
lord , we' re going to jail .
we' re not going to jail .
ls it true ?
what' s up , warren ?
i know him , but i don' t drug lord know him .
it' s just a guy i say " what' s up ? " to .
but i don' t know him know him .
do you have drugs on you ?
get them off , i' m not going to jail for you .
are you on the pipe ?
this is messed up this really sucks
every time you' re doing good trouble just pops up
he doesn' t know what he' s gonna do
this is messed up this really sucks
keep your head up , it' s your best bet
let' s hope the election' s not through
lf you see mays gilliam , please do not call the authorities .
just do whatever you can to make his life a living hell .
no more questions !
lf i see mays gilliam , i' il bust a cap in his ass .
gilliam is done and big dave says , " waa waa !
oh , god .
what am i going to do ?
what are you worried about ?
your face isn' t on the side of a bus .
i' il be the one taking a hit for this .
get me on the news so i can apologize .
that' s what the people want to hear .
you' re probably right .
make a statement of some kind , try and sound sincere
just give me a break !
you think you can say you' re sorry and all of this will go away ?
mays , you' re running for president of the united states of america .
do you have any idea why they chose you ?
we picked you because  shut up !
you' re here to lose .
arnot picked you so you could lose .
think about it .
lf they had any idea they could win this thing ... do you think they would have chosen an ignorant ass nigger like you ?
wait up .
you' re not calling me an ignorant nigger ... and thinking you' re staying on my bus .
i am not getting off this bus .
we' re in the middle of nowhere
now you need a ride from an ignorant nigger .
i am not getting off this bus !
apologize .
security !
damn you , mays gilliam !
you knew about this all along ?
ls there trouble inside the gilliam campaign ?
that' s what washington insiders want to know after gilliam' s chief advisor ...
debra lassiter , left the campaign trail .
down in the polls , gilliam still has no running mate .
sources say the teamsters may endorse lewis .
did gilliam kill jonbenet ramsay ?
police want to know .
where is mays gilliam ?
i' il tell you where he' s at .
he' s with his peeps !
hello ?
you up ?
i was hoping you' d call .
are you okay ?
i don' t know .
i guess i' m all right .
come on , talk to mama .
i don' t know .
it seems like they' re trying to get me .
everywhere i turn , they' re trying to put a foot in my ass .
after what you said , you need a foot put up in your ass .
what did you expect ?
they would just make you president ?
they take a poll for everything i do .
you ever been to a horserace ?
my dad used to take me when i was little .
the horses wear blinders .
they don' t even see each other .
they just run their race .
so don' t worry about lewis , don' t worry about the press ... just run your race .
let me ask you something .
okay .
what are you wearing ?
now , you know you need to stop .
man , news travels fast .
not 10 minutes after you fired me , i had two offers for jobs .
good offers .
what are you doing here ?
i know you got no reason to trust me , but i' m asking you to .
you' ve got five weeks left .
i know lassiter is out , but i think ...
i can help you do this .
i want to help you .
and i' m sorry , mays .
i don' t know what else to say ... but as bad as things look , i don' t think you should quit .
who said i was quitting ?
i wish i could quit .
i wish it was that easy .
you' re lucky .
you are so lucky .
you don' t know how good you got it .
you just represent yourself .
me ?
i represent my whole race .
lf i quit ... there won' t be another black candidate for 50 years .
all right .
we can get rid of the school thing with a statement that will blow things over .
but we need a running mate .
who am i supposed to pick ?
nobody wants to run with me .
we need somebody we can trust .
who do you trust ?
ln the midst of his own cinderella story ... presidential candidate gilliam is shaking it up .
he' s chosen his brother , mitch gilliam ... a bail bondsman from chicago , as his running mate .
political analysts say this may be too little , too late .
hi , i' m with the pork commission
i' m from the athlete' s foot
brother !
can you get my demo tape to somebody
are these your bags ?
look at my shoes and at the bags .
shut up and follow me .
back up .
what do you have to say about your brother' s controversial comments ?
my gosh , lady , my brother said he was sorry .
let it go .
see , that' s why nobody like your ass .
we got work to do .
we way behind in the polls .
am i getting paid for this ?
yeah .
you' re running for the vice presidency .
you' re a bail bondsman .
you have no washington experience , no political experience or connections .
how does being a bail bondsman qualify you to be vice president ?
i am a bail bondsman .
people come to me when they in trouble , like the usa .
we bail people out .
we bail out mexico ... the savings and loan , the airline industry .
now you ask me , sir , what qualify me to run for vice president .
when the country is in trouble , i' il bail them out .
hold that thought .
we have a caller from detroit .
mitch !
why you looking around ?
it' s reggie ....
where my money at ?
don' t call me with that bullshit !
you see i' m on tv .
what about nato ?
i never met nato .
i don' t talk about people behind their back .
nato is the north atlantic treaty organization .
i thought you were talking about this guy named nato .
but you have to know these things .
do you know nato jacobs ?
do you know nato jacobs ?
i' m sorry , i haven' t met the gentleman .
that' s what i said .
you know nothing about nato ?
i know nothing about nato .
why are you out here since inmates don' t have the right to vote ?
it' s not about the vote .
we' re looking out for the convicts .
we want to make sure when they get out that they stay out .
the better the education , they become more productive citizens .
mitch !
what' s up ?
shorty g !
it' s good to see you , boy !
this is shorty g. i arrested his ass .
i thought you got the chair , boy .
mr. gilliam , how would you deal with white collar crime ?
there' s no such thing as white collar crime .
and there' s no such thing as black on black crime .
crime is crime .
i don' t care if you have a white collar or a tank top .
lf you rob me , i' il whup your ass .
i' m janet silvers reporting live in d. c. , where transit operators ....
i wish we' d get into the white house .
to have a cookout ?
they were just talking about your ward .
what' s going on down there ?
they want to cut bus service until they finish construction .
i should go .
so you can blow up the bus line ?
one thing at a time .
the teamsters haven' t endorsed lewis yet .
our numbers are going up .
lf we want a real shot at this thing , we got to get lewis to debate .
he knows that .
that' s why he won' t .
he' s avoiding me like he owes me child support .
he is scared .
he' s holding the ball , hoping the clock will run out .
that' s a punk move .
ducking and hiding like a little bitch !
that may be , but he won' t debate you because you call him a little bitch .
what this community needs
ls for you to debate me right now !
tell the people that !
i thought i told you that we won' t stop .
now , my agenda
i' il tell you about our agenda .
it' s to have a debate right now !
get rid of this zero and talk to the hero .
you got time to jog , but not to debate ?
you can run , but you can' t hide .
i thought i told you we won' t stop .
what you looking for , the news ?
the news is we want to debate !
why did you change the channel ?
he' s scared !
a word from our sponsor .
we want to debate !
i thought i told you that we won' t stop .
yo , lewis !
your mother' s ass is so big , when she sits down she' s three feet taller .
yo , lewis !
your mother' s got a really big ass !
sir , it' s time we prepare for a debate .
give me one good reason i should debate that jerk .
he talked about your mother !
so what ?
are you going to just let him talk about me like that ?
after some inventive chiding on the part of alderman mays gilliam ...
vice president lewis has finally agreed to one debate ... the night before the election .
so , baby brother , this is it .
you ready ?
all right , i guess .
you guess ?
you don' t know ?
you either ready or you ain' t .
what' s your problem ?
i' m ready , okay ?
no , you ain' t .
look at you .
lf you call this ready , this won' t get it .
dress for the job you want , not for the job you got .
you ain' t talking about my clothes .
come on now .
this ain' t about me .
lf i got a good idea , it shouldn' t matter what the hell i' m wearing !
you know you messed up , man .
i' m telling you right now .
you know , this ain' t about me !
lewis ain' t no punk .
he ain' t no joke .
that man has been vice president for eight years .
he' s a war hero .
he' s sharon stone' s cousin .
you better come correct .
yeah ?
well , i got us this far !
this is as far as you' re going to get !
it' s like that ?
that' s the way it is .
geller and them up there pumping your head up .
but lewis will smack it back down !
oh , my god .
little brother , you all right ?
that' s what your ass get .
you need anything ?
because it look like you need some help .
you gonna get yours !
i' il tell ma !
you better not tell !
hello ?
don' t intrude in my life anymore .
i don' t want to have anything to do with you ... not after the way you treated me .
i' m sorry i threw you off the bus .
it was wrong .
i couldn' t take what you were saying .
what do you want ?
i want to win .
welcome to new york city for the 2004 presidential debates .
where is he ?
he was right behind me .
should i look for him ?
they' re getting nervous .
we' ve got to do something .
i can do something .
no !
ladies and gentlemen , vice president brian lewis .
wait .
here they come .
sweet .
hello , martin .
sorry i' m late .
i had to change .
mr. earl , nice to see you .
nice to see you too , sir .
let' s move .
there are 250 million people out there deciding who to vote for .
they all know lewis didn' t want to debate you .
show them why .
stay focused .
take your time .
lf he get out of pocket , put your foot in his ass .
by the way , nice suit .
" fuh buh " ?
fubu .
even i knew that .
ladies and gentlemen , alderman mays gilliam .
yo , when' s martin coming on , man ?
my momma told me to whup your ass .
the first question is directed by coin flip to the vice president .
vice president lewis ... what steps should be taken to limit our youth' s access ... to violent materials ?
our american children' s futures are at stake here .
we need to study this issue , and appropriate legislation ... that will return us to an america we can be proud of .
god bless america , and no place else .
alderman gilliam , same question , please .
how do we limit violent material ?
turn it off .
and if the kids cut it back on , knock them out .
that' s why i don' t smoke .
when i was a kid , my daddy caught me smoking ... and he knocked me out !
and to this day , i don' t smoke .
not because i' m scared of cancer .
i don' t smoke because i think my dad is going to walk through that door ... and knock me the hell out !
knock out your kids .
it helps .
vice president lewis ... with over 10, 000 gun deaths per year in the united states ... do you believe we need stricter gun control laws ?
i don' t think we need more gun control .
i say we enforce the laws that are already on the books .
the problem is , nobody reads the books .
we need to start putting laws on videos ... because everybody watches videos , mtv , bet .
we need to put some laws on the nelly video .
lf you had laws on a destiny' s child video right now , you could stop crime .
we already have gun licensing .
but that' s only to carry the gun .
let the people decide .
the people can' t decide .
the people are too busy getting shot in the ass .
that' s my brother .
that' s another reason he' s not qualified .
because i had the good sense to pick my big brother to be my running mate ?
i didn' t come here to argue with you .
yes , you did .
we' re having a debate .
a debate ain' t nothing but an argument .
a debate isn' t an argument .
yes , it is .
no , it isn' t .
yes , it is .
no , it isn' t .
i know you are , but what am l ?
can we just move on ?
this is ridiculous .
our next question comes from
i have a question .
would you like our reception to be buffet style or formal seating ?
lf you put robert next to nelson ... he' il be very angry because he wanted to be your best man .
security .
i love you so much
the candidates have agreed upon a short closing speech .
vice president lewis won the coin toss .
he has elected to go first .
thank you .
no , it isn' t .
yes , it is !
tonight you have seen two different men ... with two very different points of view , battle to win your vote .
and this is what america is all about .
as we' ve seen tonight ...
alderman gilliam can be captivating and entertaining .
but america needs more than that from its commander in chief .
to lead america , it takes experience .
now , i' ve been vice president for the last eight years .
i' m a war hero , and i' m sharon stone' s cousin .
and to me , america is like a fine performance car .
and now is not the time ... to turn this fine vehicle we call america ... over to the hands of an amateur .
i' m brian lewis , and i am your last chance .
god bless america , and no place else .
yeah , it' s over now .
why do you have to be so negative ?
give me five .
thank you .
hold it !
you' re right , vice president lewis .
i am an amateur .
when it comes to creating so many enemies ... that we need billions of dollars to protect ourselves , i' m an amateur .
when it comes to paying farmers not to grow food ... while people in this country starve every day , i' m an amateur .
when it comes to creating a drug policy that makes crack and heroin ... cheaper than asthma and alds medicine , i' m an amateur .
but there' s nothing wrong with being an amateur .
the people that started the underground railroad were amateurs .
martin luther king was an amateur .
have you ever been to amateur night at the apollo ?
james brown , luther vandross , rockwell , the crown heights affair .
hall and oates !
the fat boys , rob base .
but you wouldn' t know nothing about that .
why ?
because when it comes to judging talent and potential ... you , my friend , are an amateur !
i believe the alderman is over his time .
you had eight years to talk .
now it' s my turn .
i' m getting mine !
ladies and gentlemen , hold your applause , please .
how can you help the poor if you never been poor ?
how can you stop crime if you don' t know no criminals ?
how can you make drug policy if you never smoked a chronic ?
how can you do that ?
just a nickel bag !
i' m a real american .
i' ve been high , i' ve been robbed , i' ve been broke .
my credit is horrible !
they won' t even take my cash !
you' re always talking about , " god bless america , and no place else .
but isn' t it obvious that god has blessed america ?
america is the richest , most powerful nation on earth .
lf america was a woman , it would be a big titty woman .
and everybody loves a big titty woman !
so , in closing ...
i' d like to say you are full of shit .
god bless america , and no place else .
how about " god bless haiti " or " god bless africa " ?
how about " god bless jamaica " ?
i' m not talking about jamaica , the beach tribes you all love .
i' m talking about stabbing jamaica .
that' s what i' m talking about .
god bless america , and everybody else !
the whole world !
god bless you !
i' m mays gilliam , and i' m running for president of the united states of america .
ya heard ?
now we can watch martin !
hello ?
good morning , mr. president .
what time is it ?
i think it' s a little after 7 : 00 .
lisa , i need some help in here !
will you wait a damn minute ?
i was so proud of you .
you were so good last night .
tonight , no matter what , win or lose , i want to see you .
i don' t know .
i might have to work .
but if i don' t see you tonight , i will see you soon .
just run your race , get out there , and do what you got to do , okay ?
i' il talk to you later .
bye .
all right .
it' s election day , tuesday , november 8 , 2004 .
the stage is set for what will be ... one of the most dramatic campaign finales of all time .
who will america vote for ?
i voted for mays gilliam .
i voted for big business .
i voted for lewis .
who the fuck you think i' m voting for ?
there seems to be an agreement ... between washington , d. c. , officials and transit authority operators ... regarding the shutdown of the 9th ward bus line .
i don' t see how they could do this to us .
people got to make money and get to work .
show them how you do it .
the roof , the roof , the roof is on fire
you' re not gonna believe this .
we got the teamsters !
that' s great , little brother !
they' il announce it at a press conference .
you just have to go , shake hands , take photographs ... but it is yours .
what' s the matter ?
lf they shut down this bus service , i will drive you to work myself .
i can' t do it .
but it' s election day !
you have to get the endorsement .
you said you want to win .
you can' t snub the teamsters .
you want them to endorse lewis ?
i' m not worried about lewis .
i' m running my race .
go ahead , baby brother .
i got this .
you' re just gonna let him go ?
he' s a grown man .
they shut down the whole bus line .
what can he do about that ?
ln the latest exit poll , vice president lewis has 51 percent of the vote .
bring him back .
he got to vote . ... while mays gilliam is posting an impressive 47 percent .
you gotta get to the back of the bus .
i' m just playing .
come on .
now , he and vice president lewis are in a statistical dead heat .
come on , hoes !
while lewis and mitch gilliam have been working the campaign trail ...
mays gilliam has been out driving people to work .
damn it !
why didn' t somebody around here think of this ?
why am i not out there driving a damn bus ?
get me an suv , a minivan , a bus , a scooter ... a motorcycle , or a rickshaw .
get me some wheels , bitch !
are you going uptown ?
come on .
wait a minute !
we could write our own vows !
i love you , mays !
with the polls about 30 minutes from closing on the east coast ...
mays gilliam is actually ahead by several points .
there is no question that lewis has texas .
it seems clear gilliam is going to take new york .
new york !
it' s likely lewis will take michigan .
it looks like gilliam might just pull an upset in illinois .
lilinois !
go , mays !
this looks like it may come down to california .
this looks like it may come down to california .
this looks like it may come down to california .
i need to know .
how real is this ?
can we win without california ?
we stand a chance if you call your connections to the energy companies
no , you can' t win without california .
what are you doing here ?
shut up .
you want to win , you' il do what i tell you .
gilliam has over 90 percent minority turnout .
whites are the majority , but they' re not voting .
they don' t like you .
i like you , sir .
shut up .
how can we turn this around ?
there' s about one and a half hours left at the west coast polls .
lf there' s a leak saying gilliam is going to win , you' il get a late rush .
you get california , you get the election .
it will make the 6 : 30 news if we do it now .
we just have to put it out there .
can we do this ?
we' re the government .
we can do anything .
the race for president now turns to the west coast .
people , armageddon is upon us and big dave is scared .
lf these voting trends sustain , it' s likely that for the first time in history ... a black man will become president of the united states of america .
i have a dream that one day ... " this nation will rise up ... " and live out the true meaning of its creed . : " ' we hold these truths to be self evident . : " ' that all men are created equal . " '
checkmate .
i , richard nixon , do solemnly swear ....
i , ronald reagan , do solemnly swear ....
the race for president is over .
the election is now over .
the race for president ....
... is over .
the race for president is over .
for the first time in history , a black man , mays gilliam ... will be the next president of the united states of america .

america is taking advantage of you !
you can go to war when you' re 18 , but you can' t have a drink till you' re 21 !

ld ?
you mean to tell me a one legged teenager can' t have a drink ?
that ain' t right !
where is the nub ?
prescription drugs , i' il lower the prices .
let me explain something else to you .
you can survive a stroke ... but the high prices of medicine will give you a heart attack .
america is the richest , most powerful nation on earth .
lf america was a car , it would be a bentley ... sitting on chrome doves , with tvs in the headrests ... and a fine , naked puerto rican girl feeding you grapes !
ain' t nothing better than that !
ain' t nothing ever been better than that !
most opponents are saying your brother destroyed any chance of winning ... by naming you as his running mate .
why ?
why' d your brother make you anchorman ?

you said it was your brother .
i did my homework as well , okay ?
