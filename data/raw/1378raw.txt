you did that ?
one of my finest pieces .
you' ve done others ?
are you kidding ?
take the problem of lift .
in this construction , that was the biggest challenge .
but let' s start from the beginning .
what is a suspension bridge ?
the angle of the matches can' t be a tenth of a degree off !
a tenth of a degree , think of it !
the concorde was a different problem .
here' s a little quiz .
we' ve arrived !
which took me longer , eiffel or concorde ?

time did fly !
pierre brochant , please .

he said a lot about you .
i want to meet you .

franois pignon !
he was so awed , he was speechless .
it' il be a delight !

10 , with pignon .
it' s shaping up .
shit !
what is it ?
christine !
did you cancel your dinner ?
my god , that' s cold !
so , did you cancel ?
a sore back needs heat .
dr. sorbier said ice .
you reached him ?
in his car .
he' il be here soon .
great .
i need a drink .
a splash of scotch .
did your sore back make you deaf ?
no , i didn' t cancel .
you' re still going to that sinister dinner ?
it' s great fun .
you think it' s sinister ...
don' t sulk just because i enjoy it !
come on .
stay with me .
you know i' m not feeling well .
so come with me , for a change .
you' il have a blast .
making fun of some poor guy ?
but he' s an idiot !
idiots are fair game .
a drink at his place , then dinner .
at a restaurant ?
no , his friend has organized a big dinner .
i' m nervous .
which one ?
they' re the same .
this one' s redder .
it' s more festive .
mustn' t forget my model file .
he wants to do a book !
on my models , you realize ?
hurry , you' il be late .
you asked him here ?
to study him before dinner .
i hear he' s fabulous .
i' il leave you two together .
enjoy !
where are you going ?
i have a dinner too .
i didn' t want to go , but ...
dinner with whom ?
is it him ?
i don' t want to meet him .
no , it' s the doctor .
dr. sorbier .
come on up , doctor .
good evening , doctor .
fix him .
he has an important dinner tonight .
christine !
an idiot dinner .
each regular has to bring an idiot .
christine , please !
the idiots don' t know why they' ve been picked .
the fun is making them talk .
hilarious !
not to me , so i' m leaving .
good night , doctor .
sorry .
i called you to fix my back , not my marriage .
can i wash my hands ?
first door on the left .
in college , we used to invite ugly girls .
the ugliest one got a prize .
yes , we did that too .
but idiots are funnier .
but less definite .
some idiots are quite obvious .
mine' s unmistakable .
you look great .
thanks , louisette .
have a nice evening .
dazzle them !
a friend of yours ?
no .
my friends are not that dumb .
we pick aces .
this is big league .
where do you find them ?
it' s hard .
a real manhunt .
we have scouts who tip us off .
fifth lumbar vertebra !
is it serious ?
no , but call off your dinner .
no !
rest your back tonight .
i' il stop by tomorrow .
but , doctor ...
i have a prime idiot coming !
give me a shot !
i don' t care !
anything !
ice bag and rest , or you' il be out for three weeks .
i' m jinxed .
my phone book , please .
the phone .
what' s his name again ?
franois pignon .
what does he do ?
he' s a tax man .
isn' t that dangerous ?
what if he finds out ?
he won' t .
we' re careful .
no idiot ever found out .
he' s out .
holy shit !
what ?
his message .
he tries to be witty .
it' s pathetic .
franois is out , but don' t pout !
no need to weep , wait for the beep !
your turn to peep !
isn' t he something ?
outstanding , i' d say .
here he is .
don' t move , i' il get it .
it' s franois pignon .
6th floor , on the left .
he' s coming .
i' il leave you a sedative .
take two if you' re in pain .
wait for him .
it' il be fun .
no .
i' m late .
see you tomorrow .
call me at home if it gets worse .
see you .
leave the door open .
do me a favor .
certainly .
never invite me to dinner .
i' d wonder !
good evening .
evening , sir .
go on in .
it' s open .
thanks .
good evening , mr. pignon !
come on in !
i can' t get up .
i twisted my back .
we' il have to put off our dinner .
i' m sorry for you .
a sore back is no fun .
it' s silly .
what are you doing next wednesday ?
next wednesday ... nothing .
my friend' s giving another dinner .
you' re invited .
how very nice .
we missed you today .
we won' t miss you next week . ... l' m talking about the authentic boomerang , not those you find in sydney souvenir stores .
the primitive boomerang of proud aboriginal warriors , that boomerang has a dynamism , a motion when it' s thrown correctly , that is miraculous !
how are you ?
not too hot .
i' m a wreck .
it' s a real shame .
sit down .
no , it won' t be possible tonight .
we haven' t sat down to dinner yet , so ...
it can behead a kangaroo from 150 feet !
okay , but don' t count on us .
yes , he' s here .
very nice .
he looks like a real winner .
no , i' il bring him over next week .
bye !
so how are you , mr. pignon ?
very well .
thanks .
the message on your machine is so witty .
really ?
i wanted it to be original .
i' m still laughing .
everybody comments on it .
friends ask me to record their messages .
i can see why .
i could do yours ...
no need .
it' d take a minute .
no , it' s fine as it is , even if it might be a little conservative for you .
i' m delighted to meet you .
likewise .
since you called me at the ministry ,
i' ve been walking on air .
i thought it was a joke .
did i sound dumb on the phone ?
yes ...
i mean , no .
you were perfect .
a big publisher wanting to do a book on my models , inviting me to dinner ... you' ve changed my life .
the book project isn' t quite final yet ...
i brought photos of my finest pieces .
the eiffel tower .
superb .
took me eight months .
it shows .
you do them at night ?
and on weekends .
whenever i have time .
are you married ?
yes ...
i mean , no .
the tancarville bridge .
great !
so are you married or not ?
well ...
my wife left me .
she did ?
for a friend of mine .
those things happen .
a guy i knew at the ministry .
not a bad guy .
i invited him home .
she fell for him .
i don' t know why , because he' s no genius .
you know how many matches in this one ?
what do you mean , no genius ?
the guy she ran off with .
what a dumbbell !
come on , say a number .
dumber than ...
i mean , you' re pretty smart , so how would he rate against you ?
sorry to be so blunt , but he' s quite the idiot !
my god !
so ?
how could she run off with an idiot ?
i agree .
he only talks about windsurfing !
can i meet him ?
you like windsurfing ?
i love it .
then you' il love benjamin !
we call him dumbo .
he' s in the phone book .
under benjamin , not dumbo .
so , how many matches ?
2, 000 ?
346, 422 !
that' s not all .
how many tubes of glue ?
we' re going to that dinner !
you can walk ?
i' il try .
you got a car ?
sure .
if you drive , we' il manage .
help me up .
here we go .
you okay ?
take it easy .
37 !
what ?
37 tubes of glue .
we' il have a wonderful evening , mr. pignon !
i' m so sorry .
are you hurt ?
there might be broken bones .
now what ?
a chiropractor !
no need .
a buddy of mine .
he' s great .
i don' t need him !
he' s the best in courbevoie .
i don' t want him !
go home , i' il be fine .
what about dinner ?
it' s off .
i' m in no shape now !
the machine' s on .
we' re out .
speak after the beep .
your message is a bit flat .
it' s me .
i won' t be coming home tonight .
i may never come home again .
sorry to tell you this on a machine , but maybe it' s best .
goodbye , pierre .
i' il be going now .
sure you don' t need anything ?
yes .
everything' s fine .
good night .
sorry ...
i forgot my briefcase .
i' m with you , mr. brochant .
all the way !
thanks a lot .
goodbye .
goodbye .
what can i do for you ?
nothing .
i' m fine .
good night .
i really know what you' re going through .
i' d like to be left alone !
i said that when she left me , and i nearly died of grief alone in my house .
plus , you' ve got a bad back .
she hasn' t left me .
she' s a bit depressed .
she' il be back .
now go home , and good night !
she' il be back .
that' s what i said for two years .
i' m off to bed .
turn out the lights .
can' t i call my chiropractor buddy ?
no !
he' s great .
and cheap .
know what he charges for house calls ?
i' m with pr .
sorbier of the west side hospital .
i don' t need your buddy !
yours may be good , but look at you now !
because you fell on me !
why do i even argue with this jerk ?
you' re like a horse that missed a jump .
at the track , they' d put you out of your misery .
go away , mr. pignon !
this could be dangerous .
if the spinal marrow is affected , you might get paralyzed .
then , you' il need quite the miracle !
call sorbier !
that' s better !
what' s his number ?
look in that book .
pr .
sorbier , please .
for pierre brochant .
pierre brochant ?
i need the doctor right away .
there' s no doctor here .
sorry , i dialed a wrong number .
i skipped a line .
the handwriting' s so tiny .
who cares ? !
just hang up !
yes , i' m at his place .
yes , he' s here .
no , he' s in pretty bad shape .
he' s got a bad back .
he can' t move , he' s spread out on the floor
like a sack of potatoes .
who are you talking to ?
who am i talking to ?
really ?
then i can tell you he' s in very bad shape .
his wife left him , too .
he' s broken , body and soul !
stop that !
i must go .
he' s about to lose it .
bye !
it was your sister !
i don' t have a sister .
you don' t ?
i said , " who is this ?
she said , " his sister .
he called marlene !
she' s not your sister ?
her name is marlene hissister !
how could i know ?
she said , " marlene , his sister .
it' s confusing .
give me that phone .
hurry !
if my wife' s gone , she' il come running .
all i need is a nymphomaniac !
she' s a nympho , too ?
oh , my !
stop it , will you ?
if i call , she' il go on for hours !
tell her my wife' s back .
hurry , damn it !
my wife' s back , everything' s well .
really ?
that' s what you say !
right , sorry .
marlene hissister !
marlene hissister ?
it' s me again .
i' m calling to say mrs. brochant came home .
yes , a moment ago .
she' s fine , mr. brochant is fine , everybody' s fine .
his back is sore , but he' s taking it better .
say goodbye !
i' m not really a friend of his .
he likes my models .
i make matchstick models of engineering feats ... the tancarville bridge , the golden gate bridge ...
she doesn' t care !
she' s very interested !
don' t tie up my phone line !
sorry , i have to go now .
he needs me and in his shape , i can' t leave him alone .
oh my god !
alone ?
his wife isn' t back ?
what ?
sure she' s back ... but she stepped out .
she hasn' t walked out , she stepped out ... to throw out the garbage .
what is this ?
aries , with gemini ascending .
aries don' t lie .
i' m not lying .
enough !
i' il be right over .
she said , " i' il be right over , " and hung up .
give me that phone !
sorry , i played it too cool .
i didn' t expect her to be so cunning .
it' s you , darling .
i' il drop off the dogs and be right over .
don' t !
my wife' il be home any minute .
don' t come over !
sorry , but i doubt she' il be returning .
know what i think ?
she' s back with leblanc .
leblanc ?
why even bring him up ?
it' s over between them !
i say she' s with no one !
please stay home tonight , okay ?
that nut won' t listen !
you can go now .
i need to be alone .
can i help you to your room ?
you can' t sleep on the floor !
get me to the sofa .
slowly .
look ahead .
they' re all alike , eh ?
what ?
i gather yours ran off with someone too .
she ran off with nobody .
mine ran off with nobody , also , because benjamin is a nobody .
but she still ran off with him !
hadn' t we said goodbye ?
yes , i' il be off .
i' il get you some water for the pills , then i' il leave .
is he a friend of yours ?
go to hell !
briefcase !
when you asked about my life , i didn' t say " go to hell .
farewell , mr. brochant .
leblanc was my best friend .
we quarreled two years ago .
okay ?
over what ?
he made a pass at your wife ?
no , i stole her from him .
he lived with christine .
she left him for me .
they wrote a novel together and brought it to me .
then what ?
i took both the novel and christine .
all you windsurfers steal your friends ' wives ?
i' m no windsurfer !
give me a break !
but you told me ...
i don' t do it enough to swipe my friends ' ... what am i saying ?
is your curiosity satisfied ?
why don' t you call him ?
who ?
him .
to see if she' s with him !
i call and say , " did the woman i stole come back ?
at least , you' d know .
i called benjamin and asked , " have you left with florence ?
he said yes and hung up .
at least i knew .
what if i called him ?
you ?
i can say , " i' m a friend of mrs. brochant' s ,
where can i reach her ?
and he won' t suspect a thing !
i' m just trying to help .
thanks , but she' s not with him .
i need rest .
i won' t insist .
good night !
mr. pignon ?
yes ?
if i tell you exactly what to say , could you do it ?
sometimes i feel like you think i' m an idiot .
of course i can !
what do i say ?
we could use the book they wrote .
tell him you' re a movie producer .
you' ve read the book and want the movie rights .
good idea !
then casually , you ask about his co author .
what co author ?
my wife !
he wrote it with her !
right .
i' m sorry .
it' il never work !
it will !
it' s not easy , but i got it .
not easy ?
you' re a producer , okay ?
you have a company in paris .
no , he knows everybody here .
foreign .
american ?
german ?
belgian !
that' s it !
why belgian ?
it suits you .
you' re a belgian producer , you read " the merry go round , " and want to buy the movie rights , okay ?
is it a good book ?
it' s awful .
why ?
it bothers me .
why ?
if it' s awful , why do i want the rights ?
mr. pignon ?
you' re not a producer , are you ?
no .
you' re not belgian , either ?
no .
so you' re not calling about the book , you' re calling about my wife !
that' s tricky , but clever as hell !
what' s his number ?
01 . 47 . 45 ... never mind , i' il dial it .
his name is juste leblanc .
he has no first name ?
i told you , juste leblanc .
leblanc' s his name , juste his first name .
mr. pignon , your first name' s franois .
just think his is juste .
we' re wasting time .
my wife wrote under her maiden name , le guirrec .
she' s from brittany ?
please , stay focused !
sorry .
at the end , ask him where you can contact christine le guirrec .
i' il put on the loudspeaker .
go to it .
with a belgian accent ?
can i talk to mr. juste leblanc ?
speaking .
good evening , mr. leblanc ,
george van brueghel here , sorry to bother you so late .
i' m a belgian producer , i just got in from belgium , and i' m very interested in your novel ...
the merry go round " !
i' d like to discuss buying the movie rights .
is this a joke ?
not at all , why ?
etienne ?
what ?
cut it out , i know it' s you .
you' re mistaken .
i' m not etienne , i' m a producer from brussels .
what company ?
sorry ?
what' s your company called ?
flatland films .
a young , but dynamic company .
and you' re interested in my novel ?
very interested .
for a movie or tv ?
a movie .
a movie , for the big screen .
not the small box !
i want to do the screenplay myself .
no problem .
but we' re a small company with limited budgets .
if you' re not too greedy ...
what about my wife ?
we' il talk money later .
when can i meet you , mr ... ?
van breughel ...
my wife !
i' il call tomorrow for a meeting .
talk to you tomorrow .
talk to you tomorrow !
there !
we have the rights !
and for peanuts , i' d say !
he fell for it , he did !
what about my wife ?
what ?
he forgot about my wife !
he yaps for five minutes and forgets about my wife !
i blew it !
this tops my wildest dreams !
indeed , i blew it .
this is record breaking !
i' il call back .
give me that phone !
i' il say , " how can i reach your co author ,
christine le guirrec ?
give me that phone !
too bad , we were about to find out .
you' il say , " how can i reach your co author , christine le guirrec ?
and no more . ... some guy with an appalling accent .
van brueghel .
his company' s called flatland films .
i never heard of it , either ...
hold on , someone' s calling on the other line .
sorry to disturb you , it' s van breughel again .
my agent' s on the other line .
i' il call you .
what' s your number ?
01 . 45 . 90 . 56 . 03 .
he cut me off .
i did , you idiot !
idiot ?
you gave him my phone number !
sure , he wants to call me back .
you never stop , do you ?
sorry , i' m out of my depth .
i' m doing my best , but ...
world class !
maybe the world champion !
it' s ringing !
it' s ringing , and he' s happy !
he' s calling .
don' t we answer ?
we' re out , speak after the beep .
pierre , it' s juste .
i wondered about the belgian weirdo , then realized you' re looking for your wife .
ask me yourself , without the accent .
bye .
juste ?
it' s me .
where is she ?
i' ve waited two years for this .
but i feel sorry for you .
don' t .
just tell me if she' s with you .
she called to say she' d left you .
she was very upset .
did she say where she was going ?
no .
where could she be ?
it' s painful , huh ?
you know exactly how i feel .
but i' ve got a bad back , too !
no kidding ?
you' d laugh if you saw me ... bent over , unable to move .
you want me to stop by ?
thanks , but i' d rather be alone .
thanks again .
you don' t have to , but if she calls you again ...
i' il call you , i promise .
thanks .
i don' t deserve a friend like you .
hand me that pad , please .
put this on the door .
i' ve taken a sedative ,
i' m asleep ,
i need to be alone tonight .
i hope she won' t bug me !
shall i wait for her ?
you stay in your room , and i' il stand guard .
you' ve done enough !
i know i goofed on the phone .
i' m really sorry .
i truly want to help you .
just help me to bed .
if you feel depressed , call me and i' il be back in a second !
no !
you know what i lacked most when mine left ?
a friend to hold my hand .
goodbye .
miss hissister !
this is for you .
we spoke on the phone .
aries , with gemini ascending .
i dialed your number by mistake .
then i realized you' re his girlfriend .
his girlfriend ?
yes .
sorry i was a little confusing .
but it' s very simple .
his wife left him , but he doesn' t care .
he' s asleep and can' t be disturbed .
got that ?
perfectly .
i' il have a word with him !
marlene !
may i call you marlene ?
please .
i haven' t known him long , but i understand him .
so take my advice .
i' m listening .
give it time .
his wife just left , so don' t rush in .
be the sensuous , amusing mistress you are , all garter belts and champagne .
keep on seeing him three to four times a week , wait for your turn .
he' il fall when it' s due .
he said he saw me three to four times a week ?
i felt he' d see you every day if he could .
so don' t insist .
go home , it' s your best move .
you' re right , i won' t wake him .
good move !
i have the feeling he' il soon be at your door with flowers .
was he taking you to a dinner party ?
yes .
did he mention me ?
even if he hadn' t , i would have guessed .
nice work !
i saw the light was on and figured you weren' t asleep .
you still here ?
thank god i am !
why ?
we had a visitor .
who ?
the nutcase .
marlene ?
she just left .
she was about to force your door .
you' re lucky a guy called pignon told her " keep out !
you got rid of marlene ?
yes .
i don' t want to brag , but i was pretty cool .
i was sweet , but firm .
got rid of her fast .
you won' t see her again !
that' s good news .
a pity , because she' s a real looker .
what does she do ?
she' s a writer .
another one ?
you sleep with all your authors ?
none of your fucking business .
maybe not , but i think it isn' t nice .
i never cheated on my wife .
and the ministry of finance is a bunny hutch !
leave me alone now .
it never ends !
who is it ?
it' s mr. leblanc .
you came .
i felt bad leaving you alone .
he wasn' t alone .
i took care of him .
yes , and now you' re leaving !
i' m off .
i' il leave my pictures with you .
thank you , but , no thank you .
they' re models i make with matches .
here' s one of my finest ...
he' s not here to talk about models .
sure .
take your photos , i' m in no mood right now .
what are you up to now ?
still writing .
and i' ve already got a published .
what do you write ?
we' il talk later .
i have bad news .
she called .
she was torn between coming here and making a huge mistake .
i tried to convince her , but ...
what mistake ?
going to meneaux' s place .
what ?
pascal meneaux , from the advertising company .
she must be there now .
no !
yes .
he' s wooed her for weeks , and tonight she ...
aren' t you done ?
i' m filing them chronologically ...
do that at home !
okay !
meneaux' s the worst !
that' s why she went .
she' s mad at you .
that two cent romeo .
she' s crazy !
mine picked a real dummy !
get out of here !
good night , mr. brochant .
where does he live ?
he has a love nest ,
but as to the address ...
good night , mr. leblanc .
it' s very secret .
no one knows it .
good night , mr. brochant !
good night !
there must be a way to find it !
meneaux had a tax audit !
pascal meneaux , advertizing .

it might not be a good idea to let a tax inspector into your home !

he' s so silly .
thanks , lucien .
light , unctuous ...
my secret' s a few drops of beer in the eggs ...
the address , damn it !
lincoln st ... that' s his office ...
temple st ... that' s not it either .

those light patches ... paintings have been removed .
he doesn' t miss a trick !
you' re fabulous , lucien !
you came to help or audit him ?
he came to help !
right ?

poor mr. brochant is in a fix !
yeah , poor mr. brochant ...

here we are .
barrs st. near the park .
37 barrs st.
in neuilly .
great !
i' m off .
wait , make sure she' s there !
don' t go till you' re sure of it .
he won' t open the door .
he' s sneaky .
i' il kick it open .
what if she' s not there ?
then what ?
we could call him .
to ask if my wife' s in his bed , snug under his quilt ?
under his quilt !
are you done ?
you had a knickknack there !
i can see the dust ring .
i told you , he' s a real pro .
bravo , lucien !
you' il make me blush .
don' t be so modest !
you' ve busted many others !
we' ve got the address .
kick ' em out !
stop it , please !
i' ve got an idea .
listen to this .
we scare meneaux to make him come clean .
how ?
you call and say you know everything , you' re coming to wreck his place with three tough guys .
not bad .
we' il know right away by the way he reacts .
a fine strategy !
i can' t call him .
he knows my voice !
he knows mine , too .
and mine .
i' m with him all day .
i think i' m going to be needed !
oh , no !
only he can do it !
i really feel up to it !
we' il coach him , and he' il do fine .
just wait and see !
if you don' t want me to help ...
but who would tell us to call him ?
someone who' d have the number to his love nest .
his partner , roussin , would .
they' re very close .
roussin it is .
why wouldn' t he call himself ?
why wouldn' t roussin call ?
lt' il seem odd .
meneaux told me he' s heading to la tonight .
perfect !
we' re calling for roussin who' s on a plane .
great !
got the strategy ?
it' s simple .
he has to rehearse !
a lot !
one hell of a lot !
sit down .
repeat after me ,
i' m calling for mr. roussin .
he' s on a plane , but has a message for you .
okay .
no , repeat it .
pretend i' m meneaux and repeat what i said .
i' ve got it !
please , repeat precisely .
hello , i' m calling for mr. roussin .
he' s on a plane , and has a message for you .
perfect !
not yet .
you add , " brochant knows everything .
no , repeat it !
come on , he' s not stupid !
brochant knows everything .
then you say , " he knows about his wife .
if meneaux asks who' s speaking , you say ,
a friend of roussin' s .
brochant' s coming with three pals .
he' s with three of his toughest pals .
he' s talented !
i' m just parroting .
he' s excellent !
could i improvise a bit ?
no !
don' t shout !
you scared me !
just stick to what i told you !
come on , we' re wasting time !
what' s the number ?
01 . 47 . 47 . 39 . 63 .
here we go !
i' m scared .
the strategy' s fine .
i' m worried about the executor .
it' s ringing !
loudspeaker !
hopefully , they haven' t done it yet .
why is he not answering ?
he' s too busy !
pascal meneaux ?
yes .
he sounds tired .
that' s bad .
that' s a bad sign .
sorry to bother you .
i' m calling on behalf of mr. roussin .
yes ?
he' s on a plane , but he has a message for you .
go ahead .
brochant knows everything .
what ?
he' s coming to wreck your place !
nice going .
who is this ?
a friend of roussin' s .
brochant' s coming over , and not alone .
he' s with three of his toughest pals .
he' s crazy !
his wife' s not here !
you' re not with her ?
she canceled out .
roussin said , " he' s with mrs. brochant .
not at all .
i' m with the wife of guy who' s auditing me !
what ?
the jerk' s hounded me for months .
i' m screwing his wife , not mrs. brochant !
may i use your phone ?
certainly .
she went shopping this afternoon .
i asked her to take a form to meneaux' s office .
and bingo !
good evening , mr. meneaux .
could i speak to mrs. cheval , please ?
you know who i am .
we' re meeting tomorrow at 9 : 00 , as usual .
we' il review your whole case .
now let me speak to my wife .

of course you can put your clothes back on !
i' m not alone .
i can' t talk now .
we' il talk at home .
charlotte !

it is a bit coarse .
i' m going to puke !

first door on the left !
i said " on the left .
interesting room !
a storage room , where i keep my old things .
it' s awful , but i don' t care !

he' s a tax dodger , and i don' t care !
get a hold of yourself .

why did i fall for that bastard ?
sorry , i have to hang up .

you' re nice .
but he' s a bastard !
one hell of a bastard !
don' t say that .
he' s so mean !

mr. brochant .

for friends who admired your work !
let' s go !

good night , mr. pignon .
she' s right .

my wife says it , and everyone agrees ...
i' m mean .
you can put it on my answering machine ,
brochant is a meanie !
don' t mix sedatives and alcohol .
why not ?
it' s the moral of the story ...
brochant the meanie gets drunk alone in his big place , while nice pignon goes home saying , " the bastard got punished !
brochant' s a meanie , pignon' s a beanie !
now what ?
i need the number to the west side hospital .
he' s at it again !

sorbier .

she just hung up on me .
pr .
sorbier for you .

mrs. brochant ?

sorbier .
who is this ?
i' m your husband' s idiot .
what ?
we briefly met .
my name' s pignon ,
i' m your husband' s idiot for that dinner .
i' m listening .
i just found out why i was invited , and i' m in a state of shock .
you were in a crash , and so was i !
hello ?
yes , i' m here .
i' m not calling because i feel sorry for myself .
i feel sorry for him .
he may not be the meanest of men , but he' s the unhappiest .
i heard you tell him not to visit you .
he was so lost , so miserable , that i forgot i was the idiot and decided to call .
mrs. brochant ?
yes ?
my wife left me two years ago .
that day , my life was shattered .
i survived by making my models , but deep down , i' m still a wreck .
i wish that on no one , not even your husband .
is he there ?
what ?
he' s feeding you the lines of this moving drama ?
i swear it was my idea to call you .
he fed me nothing .
is he beside you ?
no , i' m in a phone booth .
he doesn' t love me .
he loves no one .
mrs. brochant , for two hours ,
i saw your husband try to find you .
he even called pascal meneaux , who was in the arms of a woman who wasn' t you !
he called meneaux ?
he did .
you can' t imagine what he did out of love for you .
he made up with his best friend , dumped his girlfriend .
he even braved a tax inspector !
he tidied up his whole life , in an exemplary way .
now he' s alone in his big apartment , mixing alcohol and pills .
i' m worried about him .
i know one can die of love , mrs. brochant .
i' il think it over .
thanks for calling .
don' t mention it .
goodbye .
she' il call back .
mr. pignon ?
yes ?
we' re going to the next dinner .
but this time , you' re taking me !
and i' il win first prize .
i' m exhausted .
being smart is very tiring .
i' il try it sometime .
promise me one thing .
just ask .
think twice before you call anyone an idiot .
i promise .
i swear .
here he is , mrs. brochant !
i thought you were in a phone booth .
you idiot !
no , i' m back at his place .
what an idiot !
i can explain !
what an idiot !
i' il call her back !
i' il call her back , it' il be fine !
what an idiot !
