they hide ' em up there .
they' re all messed up in the head .
you don' t know they' re all messed up .
nobody' s seen ' em .
and maybe they' re not messed up .
that' s a rumour .
nobody knows that .
i don' t believe that .
good luck , man .

i didn' t volunteer .
you causing trouble again ?
no , no trouble .

james cole cleared from quarantine .
thankyou .
you two wait outside .
he' s got a history , doctor .
violence .
antisocial six .
repeated violations of the permanent emergency code .
lnsolence .
defiance .
disregard ofauthority .
doing 25 to life .
i don' t think he' s gonna hurt us .
you aren' t gonna hurt us , are you , mr cole ?
no , sir .
why don' t you sit down , mr cole ?
we appreciate your volunteering .
you' re a very good observer .
thankyou .
we have a very advanced programme .
something very different .
a chance to reduce your sentence .
and possibly play an important role ... in returning the human race to the surface ofthe earth .
we want tough minded people .
strong mentally .
we' ve had some misfortunes with unstable types .
for a man in your position , an opportunity .
not to volunteer could be a real mistake .
definitely a mistake .
yet among the myriad microwaves ... the infrared messages , the gigabytes ofones and zeros ... we find words , byte sized now ... tinier even than science ...
lurking in some vague electricity .
but ifwe but listen ... we hear the solitary voice ofthat poet telling us ... yesterday this day' s madness did prepare ... tomorrow' s silent triumph ofdespair .
drink , foryou know not whence you came , nor why .
drink , foryou know not why you go , nor where .
wandering around in nothing but his underpants ... and one ofthose plastic , see through lady' s raincoats .
so , they get there , they ask the guy real nice for some kind of ld .
he gets agitated , starts screaming about viruses .
totally irrational , totally disoriented .
doesn' t know where he is , what day ofthe week it is .
all they got was his name .
they figured he' s stoned out of his mind .
some kind of psychotic episode .
he' s been tested for drugs ?
negative for drugs .
but he took on five cops like he was dusted to the eyeballs .
no drugs .
you believe that ?
he' s in restraints .
yeah .
weren' t you listenin ' ?
i' ve got two police officers in the hospital !
the medic gave him enough stelazine to kill a horse .
he' s rarin ' to go .
that would explain the bruises , i guess .
the struggle .
yeah .
you wanna go in there , examine him ?
yes , please .
ls this all you have ?
ran it through your system ?
no match up .
no licence , no prints , no warrants .
nothing .
i should probably go in with you .
no , thankyou .
that won' t be necessary .
all right .
he' il be right here , just in case .
mr cole , my name is kathryn railly .
i' m a psychiatrist .
i work for the county .
i don' t work for the police .
so my concern is foryour well being .
do you understand that ?
need to go !
need to go !
i can' t make the police let you go .
but i do wanna help you , so l
i need you to tell me exactly what happened tonight .

may i call youjames ?
james .
nobody ever calls me that .
have you been a patient at county ?
no .
have i seen you someplace ?
not possible .
i need to go !
i' m supposed to be gathering information .
what kind of information ?
won' t help you .
won' t help anyone .
won' t change anything .
james , do you know why you' re here ?
' cause i' m a good observer .
i' ve got a tough mind .
you don' t remember assaulting a police officer ?
why am i chained ?
why are these chains on me ?
you' ve been in an institution before , haven' t you ?
or hospital ?

that' s the future, james .
do you thinkyou' re living in the future ?
1 996 is the past .

this is 1 990 .
shut up , ladies .
where' re you taking me ?

it' s very important !
what you gotta do, jimbo , is take it easy .

let' s go .
come on , let' s go .
hey , goines !
yo , goines !
yo, jeffrey !

how much you gonna pay me ?
how much ?
i' d be doin ' yourjob .
five thousand dollars .
that enough ?
five thousand ?
i' il wire a cheque to your account as usual .
i' il give him the deluxe mental hospital tour .
kid around , makes ' em feel good .
we' re pals .
you' re the prisoners .
no , you' re the guards .
now you got it .
okay , it' s all in good fun .
here' s some games here .
and there' s get out !
get out !
he was in my chair .
games .
games .
here' s some games .
games that wanna get out .
see ?
more games .
games , they vegetize you .
see ?
lfyou play the games , you' re voluntarily taking a tranquillizer .
i guess they gave you some chemical restraints .
drugs !
what' d they give you ?
thorazine ?
haldol ?
how much ?
how much ?
learn your drugs .
know your dosages .
it' s elementary .
i need to make a telephone call .
a telephone call ?
that' s communication with the outside world .
doctor' s discretion .
lfall ofthese nuts could just make phone calls ... it could spread insanity oozing through telephone cables ... oozing to the ears ofall these poor , sane people , infecting them .
wackos everywhere .
a plague of madness .
ln fact , very few, jim jim , very few of us here are actually mentally ill .
i' m not saying you' re not mentally ill .
for all i know , you' re crazy as a loon .
but that' s not why you' re here .
you' re here because ofthe system .
there' s the television .
it' s all right there .
all right there .
look , listen , kneel , pray .
the commercials !
we' re not productive any more .
don' t make things .
it' s all automated .
what are we for then ?
we' re consumers, jim .
okay , okay .
buy a lot ofstuff , you' re a good citizen .
but ifyou don' t buy a lot ofstuff , what are you then ?
what ?
you' re mentally ill .
fact, jim .
fact ! lfyou don' t buy things : toilet paper , new cars ... electrically operated sexual devices ... stereo systems with brain implanted headphones ... screwdrivers with built in radar devices , voice activated computers
take it easy, jeffrey .
be calm !
right .
that' s right .
you' re a very attractive woman .
lfyou want to watch a particular tv programme , like allmy children ... go to the nurse , tell her the day , the time the show you wanna see is on .
but you have to tell her before the show is scheduled to be on .
this guy was always requesting shows that had already played .
yes .
no .
you have to tell her before .
he couldn' t grasp the idea that the nurse couldn' t make it be yesterday .
she couldn' t turn back time !
thankyou , einstein .
now he , he was nuts .
he was a fruitcake, jim .
okay , that' s it, jeffrey .
you' re gonna get a shot .
i warned you .
right .
i got a little carried away ... explaining the inner workings ofthe institution tojim .
i don' t really come from outer space .
oh .
l. j. washington .
he doesn' t really come from outer space .
don' t mock me , my friend .
get outta my chair !
it' s a condition of mental divergence .
i find myself on the planet ogo .
part ofan intellectual elite ... preparing to subjugate the barbarian hordes on pluto .
but even though this is a totally convincing reality for me in all ways ... nevertheless , ogo is actually a construct of my psyche .
i am mentally divergent ... in that i am escaping certain unnamed realities ... that plague my life here .
when i stop going there , i will be well .
are you also divergent , friend ?
this is a place for crazy people .
i' m not crazy .
we don' t use that term , " crazy , " mr cole .
you' ve got some real nuts here !
i know some things that you don' t know .
it' s gonna be very difficult foryou to understand it .
i' m not gonna hurt anyone !
all right .
look , have any ofyou heard ... ofthe army ofthe twelve monkeys ?
they stencil this on the sides of buildings everywhere .
have you seen this ?
have you seen this ?
why don' t you just take your time ... and try to explain this from the beginning ?
right , right .
it' s 1 990 .
okay , that makes sense .
they wouldn' t have been active yet .
five billion people died in 1 996 and 1 997 .
almost the entire population ofthe world .
only about one percent of us survived .
are you going to save us ?
how can l ?
this already happened .
i can' t save you .
nobody can .
i am simply trying to gather information to help the people in the present ... trace the path ofthe virus .
we' re not in the present now , mr cole ?
1 990 is the past .
this already happened .
that' s what i' m trying
you believe 1 996 is the present then , is that it ?
no !
1 996 is the past too .
listen to me .
what l
what l what i need to do is make a telephone call .
i can straighten this out if i make a telephone call .
who would you call ?
who would straighten everything out ?
the scientists .
they' il want to know that they sent me to the wrong time .
i can leave a voice mail message that they monitor from the present .
can i just make one telephone call , please ?
please ?
what are you doin ' in the dog bowl ?
get outta there !
who put those doritos in there anyway ?
yes ?
what ?
voice mail ?
look , i don' t know stop makin ' that noise !
i don' t know what you' re talkin ' about .
ls this a joke ?
i don' t know any scientists .
duanne , get out james who ?
wasn' t who you expected ?
no .
it was some lady .
she didn' t know anything .
well , maybe it was the wrong number .
no .
that' s why they chose me .
i remember things .
james , where did you grow up ?
dr railly .
i have the strangest feeling i' ve met you before .
wait .
this is 1 990 .
i' m supposed to be leaving messages in 1 996 !
it' s not the right numberyet !
that' s the problem !
lhave a message forthem .
won' t work .
can' t open it .
you thinkyou can remove the grill , but you can' t .
it' s welded .
see ?
told you .
all the doors are locked too .
they' re protecting the people on the outside from us ... when the people on the outside are as crazy as us .
do you know what " crazy " is ?
crazy is " majority rules . " yeah .
take germs , for example .
germs ?
ln the 1 8th century , no such thing .
nada .
nothing .
no one ever imagined such a thing !
no sane person , anyway .
along comes this doctor .
semmelweis !
semmelweis comes along , trying to convince people , other doctors mainly ... that there are these teeny , tiny , invisible bad things called germs ... that get into your body and make you sick .
he' s trying to get doctors to wash their hands .
what is this guy ?
crazy ?
teeny , tiny , invisible " what do you call ' em ?
germs ?
what ?
now , cut to the 20th century .
last week , in fact , right before i got dragged into this hellhole !
i go in to order a burger in this fast food joint .
the guy drops it on the foor .
jim , he picks it up , wipes it off .
he hands it to me like it was all okay .
what about the germs ? " i say .
he says , " i don' t believe in germs .
germs are a plot they made up so they can sell you disinfectants and soaps .
now , he' s crazy , right ?
see ?
there' s no right .
there' s no wrong .
there' s only popular opinion .
you , you , you believe in germs , right ?
i' m not crazy .
ofcourse not !
you wanna escape , right ?
that' s very sane .
i can help you .
you want me to , don' t ya ?
get you out ?
you know how to get outta here ?
yes , my son !
then why don' t ya ?
why don' t i try to escape ?
good question .
very good question .
lntelligent .
because i would be crazy to escape .
i have sent out word .
i am all taken care of .
what does that mean ?
i' ve managed to contact certain underlings , evil spirits ... secretaries ofsecretaries and other assorted minions ... who will contact my father .
and when my father finds out i' m in this kind of place ... he' il have them transfer me to one ofthose classyjoints ... where they treat you properly , like a person , a guest !
with sheets and towels like a big hotel ... with great drugs for all of us nut case , lunatic , maniac devils !
sorry .
sorry .
i got a little agitated .
the thought ofescape crossed my mind .
and suddenly
suddenly i felt like bending the fucking bars back !
and ripping out the window frames and eating them !
yes , eating them !
and leaping , leaping , leaping !
colonics for everyone !
i' m a mental patient .
i' m supposed to act out .
wait' il you morons find out who i am !
my father' s gonna be really upset .
and when my father gets upset , the ground shakes .
my father is god !
i worship my father !
these dramatic video tapes , secretly obtainedbyanimalrightsactivists ... have arousedpublic indignation .
but manyscientists vehemently disagree .
torture experiments .
we' re all monkeys .
they hurt you ?
not as bad as what they' re doing to the easter bunny .
look at them .
they' rejust askin ' for it .
maybe the human race deserves to be wiped out .
wiping out the human race ?
it' s a great idea .
it' s great .
but more ofa long term thing .
first we have to focus on more immediate goals .
i didn' t say a word about you know what .
what are you talking about ?
your plan .
emancipation .
what are you writing ?
you a reporter ?
it' s private .
a lawsuit ?

kathryn , we' ve been working together for fouryears .
i' ve never seen you like this before .
so please stop being so defensive .
this isn' t an inquisition .
i didn' t think i was being defensive .
i was trying to explain exactly what
he should' ve been in restraints .
it was bad judgment on your part , plain and simple .
why not own up to it ?
okay , it was bad judgment .
but i have the strangest feeling about him .
i' ve seen him before and i' m trying  two policemen are in the hospital .
now we' ve got a security guard with a skull fracture .
i said it was bad judgment !
what else do you want me to say ?
you see that ?

you' re being defensive .
lsn' t she being defensive ?
we have another situation .
he was fully restrained ?
yes , sir .
i did it myself .
and he was fully sedated ?

ah , you can talk !
my name' s not bob .
not a prob , bob .
where' d they send you ?
where are you ?

what' s that supposed to mean ?
maybe means ... maybe i' m in the next cell .
another volunteer like you .
or maybe i' m in the central office ... spying on ya for all those science bozos .
or , hey ... maybe i' m not even here .
maybe i' m just in your head .
no way to confirm anything .
where' d they send ya ?
1 990 .

how was it ?
good drugs ?
lots of pussy ?
hey , bob , you do thejob ?
you find out the big info ?

theyare the ones who aregoing to do it .

it' s a reconstruction ofa deteriorated recording .
weak signal .
we have to put them together one word at a time .
wejust finished rebuilding this .
did you or did you not make this call ?
i couldn' t make any call .
you sent me to the wrong year .
it was 1 990 .
you' re certain ofthat ?
what' d you do with your time , cole ?
did you waste it on drugs ?
women ?
they forced me to take drugs .
forced you ?
why would someone force you to take drugs ?
i was in trouble .
i got arrested .
i did what you wanted .
i got a specimen , a spider .
i didn' t have anyplace to put it , so i ate it .
but you sent me to the wrong year , so it really doesn' t matter .
did you see this when you went back ?
no , sir , i don' t think so .
what about these people ?
did you see any ofthese people ?
no .
oh , wait , wait .
him ?
you saw that man ?
maybe in the mental institution .
you were in a mental institution ?
oh , god .
cole , you were sent back to make some very important observations .
you could' ve made a real contribution .
helped us to reclaim the planet .
as well as reducing your sentence .
the question is , cole , do you want another chance ?
last connection going on .
no mistakes this time , cole .
stay alert .
keep your eyes open .
we' re thinking about the spider , cole .
try and do something like that again .
just relax now .

i don' t know where i am .
you gotta help me find ' em !
jose ?
jose !
cole !
cole , where are we ?
help me , cole !
oh , god , wait !
ln a season ofgreatpestilence ... there are omensanddivinations .
and one ofthe four beasts gave unto the seven angels ... seven golden vials full ofthe wrath of god ... who liveth forever and ever .
revelations .
ln the 1 4th century , according to accounts ofofficials ofthat time ... this man appeared suddenly in the village ofwyle near stonehenge ... in april of 1 362 .
using unfamiliar words and speaking in a strange accent ... the man made dire prognostications about a pestilence ... which he said would wipe out humanity in approximately 600 years .
obviously this plague doomsday scenario is considerably more compelling ... when reality supports it with a virulent disease ... whether it' s the bubonic plague , small pox or alds .
now we have technological horrors as well ... such as chemical warfare , which first reared its ugly head ... during the deadly mustard gas attacks ofworld war l .
during such an attack in the french trenches in october of 1 91 7 ... we have an account ofthis soldier ... who , during an assault , was wounded by shrapnel ... and hospitalized , apparently in a state of hysteria .
doctors found he had lost all comprehension of french ... but that he spoke english fuently ... albeit in a regional dialect they didn' t recognize .
the man , though physically unaffected by the gas ... was beside himself .
he claimed that he had come from the future ... that he was looking for a pure germ ... that would ultimately wipe mankind offthe face ofthe earth ... starting in the year 1 996 .
though injured , the young soldier disappeared from the hospital ... no doubt trying to carry on his mission to warn others ... and substituting for the agony ofwar ... a self inficted agony we call " the cassandra complex .
cassandra , in greek legend , was condemned to know the future ... but to be disbelieved when she foretold it .
hence , the agony offoreknowledge , plus the impotence to do anything about it .
i' m going right out to get vaccinated .
i think , dr railly , you' ve given alarmists a bad name .
i have ?
there' s real data that the planet cannot survive the excesses ofthe human race .
this is true .
proliferation ofatomic devices .
uncontrolled breeding habits .
pollution of land , sea and air .
the rape ofthe environment .
ln this context , it' s obvious chicken little represents the sane vision ... and that homo sapiens ' motto , " let' s go shopping " ... is the cry ofthe true lunatic .
please , dr railly .
i wonder ifyou' re aware of my own studies .
see you at work tomorrow .
i' il give you a call tomorrow .
get in the car !
i' ve got a gun .

when i locate them , they' il send a scientist back here .
that scientist will study the virus .
when he goes back to the present , he and the scientists will make a cure .
police officers from threejurisdictions ... apparently including specialtacticalunitpersonnel ... have nowbeen mobilizedto control thegrowing thousands ofonlookers ... here in fresno , california .
does that disturb you ?
no .
thought it was about us .
thought maybe they' d captured us and arrested me .
just a joke .
i remember being very afraid for that little boy .
all alone , down that well ... not knowing ifanybody' s gonna get him out .
first time i was really afraid when i was a kid .
what do you mean , " when you were a kid " ?
never mind .
just a prank , a hoax .
that boy' s hiding in a barn .
there are omens and divinations .
one ofthe four beasts gave unto the seven angels ... seven golden vials full ofthe wrath of god ... who liveth forever and ever .
you won' t think i' m crazy when people start dying next month .

then they' il find out .
they' il catch on .
wait .

dragons in their pleasant palaces .
the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air ... and there came " you !
you' re one of us .
this is it .
come on .
can we help you ?
it' sjust a tape .
i' m looking for the army ofthe twelve monkeys .
we don' t know anything about an army ofthe twelve monkeys sojust disappear .
just want some information .
didn' t you hear me ?
don' t hurt her !
please , i' m a psychiatrist .
just do whatever he tells you to do .
he' s disturbed .
he' s dangerous .
pleasejust cooperate .
you want money ?
we only got a few bucks .
i told you what i want .
get down .
lock that door .
lock it now !
i told you that goines would get us  shut up !
goines ?
jeffrey goines ?
jeffrey becomes this big star , and the media latch onto him ... because he' s picketing his own father ... a famous nobel prize winning virologist .
you must have seen all that on tv .
i don' t watch tv .
ls this him ?
yeah , that' s him , that' s him .
what are you gonna do to us ?
tell me more aboutjeffrey .
jeffrey started getting bored with the shit we do picketing , leafeting , letter writing stuff .
he said we were ineffectual , liberal jerk offs .
he wanted to do guerrilla actions in order to educate the public .
like this ?
he let 1 00 snakes loose in the senate .
but we weren' t into that kind ofstuff .
it' s counterproductive .
we told him .
so he and 1 1 guys , they split off ... and formed this underground army .
the army ofthe twelve monkeys .
see ?
they started planning a " human hunt .
they bought stun guns , nets and bear traps .
they were gonna go to wall street and trap lawyers and bankers .
they didn' t do it , ofcourse .
they didn' t do any of it .
like always , mr big shot sold his friends out .
what does that mean ?
he goes on tv and gives this big news conference , tells the world ... hejust realized his dad' s experiments are vital for humanity ... and that the use ofanimals is absolutely necessary ... that from now on , he, jeffrey goines , will personally supervise the labs ... to make sure all the little animals aren' t going to suffer .
what is this ?
people like that aren' t accessible .
you can' tjust barge in on them .
it' s not how the world works .
be quiet and drive the car .
i know what i' m doing .
no , you don' t .
this car is stolen , and we are in big trouble .
big trouble .
lfyou don' t turn yourselfover to the police , they' re going to kill you .
they' re going to shoot me , too , because i' m an accessory to murder .
you' re all going to die .
nobody is going to die .
you' re not going to save the world , okay ?
you' re delusional .
you' ve made all this up out of bits and pieces in your head .
no .
yes !
let me give you an example .
you knowjeffrey goines .
you were both patients at county hospital .
jeffrey goines was a fruitcake .
he told you that his father was a famous scientist who worked with viruses ... so you incorporated that information to this cockeyed fantasy .
he didn' t say his father was a scientist .
he said his father was god .
this is insane .
prominentpsychiatrist andauthor drkathryn raillyhasbeen abducted ... bya dangerousmentalpatient , james cole .
cole was underrailly' s care sixyears ago ... when he made a dramatic escape
what is the matter with your leg ?
i got shot .
shot ?
who shot you ?
i don' t know .
it was some kind ofwar .
never mind .
you wouldn' t believe me anyway .
what are you doing ?
we don' t need gas .
i thought you didn' t know how to drive .
i said i was too young to drive .
i didn' t say i was stupid .
this can' t go on .
lfyou have a bullet in your leg , i have to take care of it .
i' m a doctor .
i need some supplies .
meanwhile , in fresno , california ... where mining engineers continue theirattempt ... to sinka shaftparallelto the one in which ricky isbelievedtrapped ... authorities saythere isstilla chance the boymight be alive .
you shouldn' t put your weight on it .
you need stitches and antibiotics .
lucky foryou , it' s near the surface .
i love seeing the sun .
wait .
let me help you .
you smell so good .
you have to give yourself up .
you know that ?
what are you doing ? james ?
i' m sorry .
what are you doing ?
stop it !
what are you doing ?
i' m sorry .
let go of me !
they find him ?
who ?
that kid , the one in the pipe .
you believe that ?
they' re lowering a monkey down there ... with an infrared camera strapped on him ... and a roast beefsandwich wrapped up in tin foil .
you' re makin ' it up .
i shit you not , man .
life is really weird .
a monkey and a roast beefsandwich .
would that i could enjoy this opulent dinner ... and this most stimulating and exciting company ... for itself , with no sense of purpose .
but , alas , i am burdened .
for with all this excess of public attention and cacophony of praise ... there comes great responsibility .
i don' t have to tell you all that the dangers ofscience ... are a timeworn threat .
from prometheus stealing fire from the gods
what friend ?
i' m not expecting anyone .
but never before
this is ridiculous .
my father' s giving a major address . ... to fear the power ... we have at hand .
normally , ifwe caught a guy ... sneaking around with no ld , we' d bust his ass .
excuse my french .
this one says he knows you .
since you seem to have had a few unusual associates ... we certainly would not want to arrest one ofyour closest pals .
never seen him before in my life .
feel free to torture this man , or whatever it is you do .
i' m going back to listen to my father' s eloquent discourse on the perils of
i' m here about some monkeys .
monkeys ?
monkeys , yes .
twelve ofthem .
arnold .
you look like shit .
you know this man ?
ofcourse i know this man .
arnold pettibone .
gee , arnie , it' s black tie .
i said , " drop by .
but it' s dad' s big do vlps , senators , secret service .

real killer feast we' re putting on .
lots ofdead lamb , dead cow , dead pig .
shall we ?
hi .
how are you ?
hello .
very attractive .
the great escape , " 1 990 .
watch it !
huh ?
county hospital ?
am i right ?
i can' t do anything about what you' re going to do .
i can' t change anything .
i won' t stop you .
i can' t stop you .
i just want the information .
come on .
hi , ladies .
so nice to see you again .
watch your step on the way down .
all right .
who blabbed ?
bruhns ?
weller ?
i just want access to the pure virus .
virus ?
i need to know where and what it is .
i get it .
i see what you' re up to .
it' s your old plan , isn' t it ?
what plan ?
your plan .
i don' t know what you' re talking about .
yes , you do .
we were in the day room watching television ... and you were upset about the desecration ofthe planet , which i understand .
then you said , " wouldn' t it be great to have a germ or virus ... that would wipe out mankind and leave the animals and trees ?
you' re trying to confuse me .
you were so funny .
i told you my father was this famous virologist .
you said , " he could make a germ , and we could steal it .
you were so funny .
they mutate !
we live underground !
the world belongs to the dogs and cats .
we live like worms .
i just need the information !
take it easy .
you are a nutcase , completely deranged !
delusional , paranoid .
your process is all fucked up .
your information tray isjammed , man .
do you know what it is , the army ofthe twelve monkeys ?
it' s a collection ofspace case do gooders saving rain forests .
i have nothing to do with those bozos any more .
i' ve quit being the rich kid fall guy for a bunch of ineffective fanatics !
so much foryour grand plot , asshole !
my father has warned people about the dangers ... ofexperimenting with dna viruses foryears .
you processed that information through your addled , paranoid infrastructure .
lo and behold , a non profit organization ... becomes a sinister , revolutionary cabal !
this man is complete bat shit !
ladies and gentlemen ... do you realize where he thinks he comes from ?
captain dan miller , the man in charge ofthe rescue operation ... sayshe has consulted with experts ... andtheyassure us there willbe no negative
lfyou ask me , the monkey' s gonna eat that goddam sandwich himself .
did a man just come running through here ?
hisprimaryresponsibility was to the missingboy .
policesay that the bodyofa woman ... foundstrangled in knutson state park ... couldbe kidnapping victim ...
drkathryn railly .
anybody see someone come through here ?
the body wasdiscovered less than an hourago byhikers .
but we have an unconfirmedreport that the victim ... a woman in herlate20s orearly30s ... wassavagelymutilated .
earlierin the day , police located railly' sabandonedcar .
it wasfoundnot farfrom
any sign of him ?
nothing .
he can' tjust disappear .
you bastard !
i could have died in there , you son ofa bitch !
what are you thinking of ... you twisted sack ofshit ?
sorry i locked you in the trunk .
i' m sick ofyou .
what have you done ?
did you kill somebody ?
yes .
a million people , five billion people .
what ?
jeffrey goines said that it was my idea about the virus .
we were in the institution .
it was all so fuzzy with the drugs .
do you think it was my idea ?
do you think maybe i wiped out the human race ?
nobody is gonna wipe out the human race .
not you orjeffrey or anybody else .
you' ve created something in your mind .
mentally divergent ?
whatever .
a substitute reality ... because you don' t want to deal with anything .
i would love it ifthat was true .
it can be dealt with , but only ifyou want to .
i can help you .
they' re after me .
who is afteryou ?
we have to get out of here .
there were policemen at that party .
party ?
you went to a
never mind .
it' s important you surrender instead ofthem catching you running away .
wouldn' t it be great if i was crazy ?
then the world would be okay .
give me the gun .
where is the gun ?
i lost the gun .
i could live right here .
you got water , air , stars .
i' m gonna attract their attention .
debris .
i' m gonna attract their attention so they know where we are .
i love this world !
they' re gonna tell you to put your hands on your head .
do what they say .
i love the frogs , the spiders .
i' il be with you .
i' il help you .
i won' t let them
then i said something about cooperating , and he said he would do that .
so i got in the car .
thanks .
and when l
i started honking the horn , and when i got out , he was gone .
i tell you something .
you lucked out .
for a while we thought you were a body found down state , mutilated .
he wouldn' t do that .
this the man he attacked ?
i want to be clear about this , okay ?
this man and the other one were severely beating us .
james cole didn' t start it .
ln fact , he saved me .
funny thing , doctor .
maybe you can help explain it to me , you being a psychiatrist and all .
why do kidnap victims always tell us about the guys that grabbed ' em ... and they try to make us understand ... how kind these bastards really were .
it' s a normal reaction to a life threatening situation .
he' s sick , okay ?
he thinks he comes from the future .
he lives in a meticulously constructed fantasy world that' s disintegrating .
he needs help .

drrailly returnedto baltimore without makingapublicstatement .
the authorandpsychiatrist is currently in seclusion at herhome .
meantime , police havepiecedtogether a scenario oftheseries ofevents ... that began with escaped mentalpatientjames cole
sorry .
no , it' s okay .
i' m just hyper alert .
i can' t sleep .
did you take a sedative ?
i hate those things .
they mess me up .

please .
ln fresno , california , the corn field that wasjammed with spectators

when lfoundyou
congratulations , cole .
well done .
well done .
during your interview , while you were under the infuence ... you told us you liked music .
this isn' t a prison, james .
this is a hospital .
until you recoveryour equilibrium .
you' re still a little disoriented .
time travel is a very stressful thing .
you stood up very well , considering .
you connected the twelve monkeys with a famous virologist and his son .
others will take over now .
we' il be back in service in months .
we' il retake the planet .
this is what you' ve been working for .
a full pardon .
you' il be out of here in no time .
women will want to get to know you .
i don' t want your women !
i want to get well !
and you will be well, james .
soon .
you know , you people don' t exist .
you' re not real .
we can' t travel back in time .
you' re not here .
you can' t trick me .
you' re in my mind .
i am insane , and you are my insanity .
he not only used the word " prank " ... he said the boy was hiding in a barn .
kathryn , kathryn , he kidnapped you .
you saw him murder somebody ... and you knew there was a real possibility ... he could kill you too .
you' re under tremendous emotional stress .
for god' s sake , owen , listen to me .
he knew about the boy in fresno ... and he says five billion people are gonna die .
no way he could possibly know that .
you' re a rational person .
you' re a trained psychiatrist .
you know the difference between what' s real and what' s not .
what we say is the truth is what everybody accepts , right ?
psychiatry is the latest religion .
we decide what' s right and wrong .
we decide who' s crazy or not .
i' m in trouble here .
i' m losing my faith .
yousure fuckedup , bob .
but lcan understand .
you don' t wantyourmistakes pointedout toyou .
lcan relate to that , oldbob .
lknow whatyou' re thinkin ' .
you' re thinkin' ldon' t exist except inyourhead .
lcan see thatpoint ofview .
butyou couldstilltalk to me , couldn ' tya ?
i saw you ... in 1 996 , in the real world .
you pulled out your teeth .
why wouldlpullout myteeth , bob ?
that' sa no no .
and when didyousayyousawme ?
ln 1872 ?
leave me alone !
yellin ' won' tgetyou whatyou want .
you have to besmart toget whatyou want .
what do i want ?
you don' t know whatyou want ?
sureyou do , bob .
you know whatyou want .
you tell me .
tell me what i want .
to see theskyandthe ocean ... to be topside ... breathe the air ... to be with her .
lsn ' t that right ?
lsn ' t that whatyou want ?
bob ?
jim halperin , philly pd .
sorry to call you so early .
you found him ? ls he okay ?
no , no .
au contraire , doctor .
no sign ofyour good friend , the kidnapper .
however , the plot does thicken .
i got a ballistics report here on my desk .
it says the bullet you claim you removed from cole' s thigh ... is , in fact , an antique .
andallindicationsare ... it wasfiredsometime priorto the 1920s .
howabout ltake a spin down there ?
this can' t be .
you andlcangrab a bite to eat ... and maybe you could revise or amplify your statement .
you can' t trick us , you know .
it wouldn ' t work .
no , sir .
you haven' t become addicted , haveyou ... to that dying world ?
no , sir .
i just want to do my part to get us back on top ... in charge ofthe planet .
and i have the experience .
i know the people involved .
he really is the most qualified .
but all that behaviour .
you said we weren' t real .
i don' t think the human mind is meant to exist ... in two different ... whateveryou called it , dimensions ?
it' sjust too stressful .
you said that yourself .
it' s very confusing .
you don' t know what' s real and what' s not .
butyou know what' s realnow .
yes , sir , i do .
no , i don' t know anything about ... a monkey army , doctor .
no , nothing whatsoever .
good lord , if my son was ever involved in something like that
yeah ?
well , i' m sorry .
i think it' s doubly inappropriate to discuss ... security matters with you , dr railly .
but if it will ease your mind ... rest assured that neither my son ... nor any other unauthorized person ... has access to potentially dangerous organisms in my laboratory .
ls that clear to you now ?
thankyou so much foryour concern .
women psychiatrists !
i attended a lecture of hers once .
apocalyptic visions .
she was suddenly struck ... by the most preposterous notion aboutjeffrey .
has she succumbed to her own ...
theoretical " cassandra disease ?
maybe we ought to review our security procedures .
perhaps upgrade ' em , you know ?
beef' em up .
let' s consider again our current information .
lfthe symptoms were first detected in philadelphia ... on december 27 , 1 996 , that makes us know that
it was released in philadelphia probably on december 1 3 , 1 996 .
and was seen sequentially after that in
san francisco , new orleans ...
rio dejaneiro ...
rome , kinshasa ...
karachi , bangkok , then peking .
that was very well done .
lfyou' re in there , i have to talk to you !
it' s the kidnap woman .
the one who was with the guy who tied us up .
turn offthe lights .
turn offthe light !
what' s she doin ' ?
she' s drawing attention to us .
i don' t know what you' re up to , but you' re gonna get us in deep shit .
walkies ready , batteries charged ?
i saw you !
i saw somebody in there !
secret experiments .
that' s what they do .
secret , weird stuff .
notjust on animals .
i know you .
do ' em on people too down at  have you seenjames cole ?
they' re watching you .
takin ' pictures .
the police .
i know .
look .
i have to contactjames .
it' s very , very important that he' s really careful when he reaches me .
do you understand that ?
good .
who' sjames ?
he was with me .
he spoke to you several weeks ago .
he said that you were from the future and that you were watching him .
bolt cutters .
did you get the bolt cutters ?
one dozen .
they' re in the van .
the plans for the security system ?
all right here , committed to memory .
you know what she' s doin ' out there ?
what' s it say ?
i can' t see it .
forget about my psychiatrist and concentrate on the task at hand .
your psychiatrist ?
did you just say your psychiatrist ?
ex psychiatrist .
this woman was your psychiatrist ... and now she' s spray painting our building ?
what' s it say ?
what ?
there' s a policeman over there .
pretend you don' t know me .
i want to turn myself in .
where is he ?
james !
down !
no , it' s okay .
i' m not crazy any more .
i mean , i am .
i' m mentally divergent .
i know that now .
i want you to help me .
i want to get better .
let' s get outta here .
he' s going .
go !
i' ve seen that before .
no , you haven' t .
a guy in a ford is chasing her and some other guy i can' t see .
no problem .
it' s probably just another kidnapping ... featuringjeffrey' s shrink .
pardon me .
make that ex shrink .
this is your leader ?
a certifiable lunatic ... who told his former psychiatrist all his plans ... for god knows what wacko irresponsible schemes ?
god knows what she' s written on that wall !
who cares what psychiatrists write on walls ?
you think i told her about the army ofthe twelve monkeys ?
lmpossible !
do you know why ?
do you know why ?
because , you pathetically ineffectual ... and pusillanimous pretend friend to animals , i' il tell you why .
because when i had anything to do with her six years ago ... there was no such thing , i hadn' t thought of it yet .
then how come she knows what' s going on ?
well , here' s my theory on that .
when i was institutionalized , my brain was studied exhaustively ... in the guise of mental health .
i was interrogated , x rayed .
i was examined thoroughly .
then they took everything about me and put it into a computer ... where they created this model of my mind .
yes !
using that model ... they managed to generate every thought ...
i could possibly have in the next ten years ... which they then filtered through a probability matrix ofsome kind ... to determine everything i was gonna do in that period .
so , you see ... she knew i was gonna lead the army ofthe twelve monkeys ... into the pages of history before it even occurred to me .
she knows everything i' m ever gonna do before i know it myself .
how' s that ?
kweskin , you finish here .
i' il meet you there .
and ifyou forget one thing , i' il have you shaved , sterilized and destroyed .
jeff ?
what ?
you' re a great man .
fuck the bozos !
he' s seriously crazy .
you know that .
there .
over there .
okay .
come on .
i need a room .
thirty five bucks an hour .
an hour ?
you want quarter hours ?
go someplace else .
here' s ... twenty five , six , seven for an hour .
deal ?
one hour , honey babe .
number 64 .
sixth foor .
up the stairs , end ofthe hall .
elevator' s busted .
she' s not " honey babe .
she' s a doctor .
my psychiatrist .
understand ?
whatever gets it up foryou, jack .
tommy , this is charlie over at the globe .
you know ifwallace has a new girl ?
sort ofa rookie type ?
a little weird ?
does fantasy acts ?
okay , you were standing there looking up at the moon .
you were splashing through the water , and then what ?
i thought i was in prison again .
just like that , you were in prison ?
no , not really .
like you said , it was all in my mind .
you disappeared .
one minute you were there , the next minute you were gone .
did you run through the woods , or
i don' t know .
i don' t remember .
the boy in the well .
how did you know that wasjust a hoax ?
it was ?
i didn' t know .
you said he was hiding in a barn !
i think i maybe saw a tv show about that ... when i was a kid where a boy
it wasn' t a tv show !
it was real !
maybe this boy saw the same tv show that i did ... and he copied it .
look , you were right .
i am mentally ill .
i imagined all these things , these people .
i know they' re not real .
i can trick them .
i can make them do what i want .
i worked on ' em a little bit .
i got back here to get better .
i can stay here .
what does this mean to you ?
i think i had a dream about this .
you had a bullet from world war i in your leg .
