the kingdom hospital rests on ancient marshland where the bleaching ponds once lay .
here the bleachers moistened their great spans of cloth .
the steam from the cloth shrouded the place in permanent fog .
then the hospital was built here .
the bleachers gave way to doctors , researchers , the best brains in the nation and the most perfect technology .
to crown their work they called the hospital the kingdom .
now life was to be charted , and ignorance and superstition never to shake science again .
perhaps their arrogance became too pronounced ,
like their persistent denial of the spiritual .
for it is as if the cold and damp have returned .
tiny signs of fatigue are appearing in the solid , modern edifice .
no living person knows it yet , but the portal to the kingdom is opening once again .
thank you , sweden .
are you stig g. helmer ?
yes , yes .
will you sign here ?
my volvo !
how happy you make me !
how much is it ?
i think we should let the courts decide .
you have now identified yourself as stig g. helmer and accepted the writ .
the first hearing will be in a fortnight .
spirits , spirits !
i don' t think this is a good idea .
spirits , spirits ...
oh , there you are !
i have a little surprise for you .
you do look nice , rigmor .
yes ... close your eyes .
bondo' s cancer looks nasty .
we must go for a marrow transplant .
the ultimate treatment is the only way .
precisely what my therapist told me yesterday .
with a bit of luck i' il be giving up all this doctoring and management .
you can open your eyes now .
spirits !
spirits !
spirits ...
more of you !
more !
more !
more !
i now pronounce you man and wife .
thank you .
you should have had far more lessons .
well , now that' s broken , too .
are you injured , mummy ?
no .
lf those were birds of passage , there certainly were a lot .
this is what we' ve confiscated from patients today alone .
doesn' t the dg want to see it ?
ugh , they don' t look nice at all .
may we talk to the patient who' s confessed to using poultices ?
i think she would really like to relieve her conscience .
i think we' il do something else .
that patient is interesting .
i' d recommend talking to her ...
good morning , dg .
l want to see the minister of health now .
often , company is the best medicine .
but ... he is far too poorly .
we are proud of our operations .
but postoperative care is the alpha and omega .
there we must be strict .
no visits by high or low .
out of my way , moesgaard .
or i' il knock you down .
i am going to open the door .
you can' t .
why not ?
because ...
because he' s been discharged .
the minister has been discharged .
discharged ?
i thought he was poorly ?
people with such a sense of duty are hard on themselves .
we should be grateful to our members of parliament .
parliament ?
it' s neurosurgery' s charm .
you' re flat out one day , on your feet the next .
a lesson one otherwise only learns in the school of life .
spare me life and your observations , moesgaard .
i just hope he won' t say anything silly in the house .
christmas is coming and the goose is getting fat ...
i think i can hear him .
we all do .
great men often leave an echo .
he has infected the other patients .
they imitate his voice .
why ?
due to the scourge of the hospital .
our commitment to the city dwellers .
the lower classes cannot distinguish their own personalities from others ' .
they are parasites , pure and simple .
call me oldfashioned , but that' s what i think .
mummy , come on !
it' s only the wind .
shhh !
did you hear that ?
it sounds like a keening .
as if from a wounded animal ...
that' s because he opened the door and closed it again .
you master logic like you master the red songbook .
when you don' t need to !
there is something terribly wrong .
why is the animal in such pain ?
come on , bulder !
this place is turning into a zoo .
what do you want ?
i haven' t time for all this nonsense .
i don' t want you .
little brother does .
hello , hook ...
i thought you might be the right person to persuade mummy .
i so much want to die .
but mummy won' t help me .
lf the freak on the wall wants to die help him to do so as soon as possible .
lf we protect all the deformed , the world will drown in crud .
it' s so fucking ... public .
you are sick .
he is sick .
and you are sick if you can' t see that the weak must be purged .
you are the weak one . lf you had but a fraction of his strength you' d be big enough to let everything around you live .
that' s enough crap .
lf he wants to die , let him .
no !
you mustn' t die .
i want you to live .
do you hear ?
i want you to live .
they are marching up and down a lot today .
and when they' ve marched back and forth for a whole day they think they' ve come an awful long way .
they are ants .
they do bustle about !
they bustle when they oughtn' t .
somebody' s poked a stick into the heap to see them run round themselves .
they dropped that medicine in 1994 .
it didn' t work on tennis elbow after all .
tennis elbow ?
i have epicondylites laterales humeri sinister .
like i said .
tennis elbow .
they said it could be serious .
yes , on centre court .
ouch !
let go of me !
yes , when you' ve explained how i ended up in the archives again with another danish cretin .
pappi !
such buddies !
i' m going on a kind of course in the old buildings for a week .
do you want to borrow the car while i' m away ?
of course chacun a son gout and all that , but for motorway driving you can' t beat an audi .
my choice is purely aesthetic .
an ugly or a beautiful death ?
helmer and camilla are both killing me .
i' ve got problems of my own .
tell camilla it' s over and swot for your exam .
you obviously don' t know the moesgaard motto .
what' s that ?
a challenge is a challenge .
deep , very deep . lsn' t 1600 pages in two days enough of a challenge ?
no .
there must be an honourable way out .
dna .
glfts
our inheritance and our gift from the pain of generations !
thank you for the gift of allowing me to be a real bondo .
thanks for the joy that fills me now as i dream of the intellect that is my family' s indelible badge of nobility .
the body may deceive but never intellect .
there will be no classes with me for a while .
i' m embarking on the preliminaries for a marrow transplant .
hopefully we shall meet again when i emerge on the other side .
ls that good ?
yes .
can you feel it ?
yes .
that' s great .
great .
i am a chicken .
i am a chicken .
yes , i' m a real chicken .
i' m a chicken .
so what are you ?
i' m a chicken .
so what are you ?
don' t just repeat me .
answer the question .
yes .
what was the question ?
i am a chicken , damn it .
ls that a question ?
i' ve had it up to here .
please be horrid to einar , all of you .
really horrid .
until he figures out whether he wants to play or not .
fair enough .
when do i get my little wednesday prezzie , eh ?
you' ve only just had your little tuesday prezzie .
we don' t want to spoil you .
go easy on your husband .
see how fine he looks ?
and how hard he works !
you have become a greater man .
lf the word " danish " didn' t sound so hollow , i' d have called you that .
how' s it going , bondo ?
splendidly , thanks .
i' m ready for the transplant .
that' s the problem .
we can' t find a donor .
not so far , anyway .
normally we look for compatibility in the family , but you have nobody .
a shame .
there was talk of a halfbrother .
my father was a virile fellow .
great intellects are , you know .
a half brother would be fine .
he' d be a real bondo .
the brethren send their respects .
even helmer has acquired new zeal .
my desire and ambition is but one .
i desire to become a duck , only a duck , nothing but a duck .
dear brethren .... and this duck ...
nivesen thinks he has such a good grip on the dg that we may permit ourselves one of our bolder activities .
to ensure a superficial knowledge of the occult we are fighting ,
i have invited mrs. drusse to join us .
she has agreed to come tomorrow evening for a seance and a talk about alternative medicine .
please consider whom we should choose as our central medium .
it' s at mrs. drusse' s request .
we need a man who is not a slave of his intellect and whose ego is particularly weak .
where the hell has moesgaard got to ?
get into pairs . ...
come on .
yes ?
why not einar ?
i don' t like him .
but einar is in our group .
he only wants to feel me up .
i see .
something is happening .
do you sense it ?
we have made progress .
good .
he hasn' t paid .
hasn' t he paid ?
i' m sure i' ve paid .
show me the receipt .
what the devil are you playing at ?
wednesday was the last day .
this is dated thursday .
what a head i had !
professor helmer is coming .
just like that !
wow !
what is this ?
do the alcoholics from other wards send you beer ?
no , it was for us ...
lf you address the crate to yourself ... ... with the yellow flag ... ... it goes all round the system , through all the buildings , and back again .
it' s a paternoster .
a kind of dumb waiter .
yellow flag out ... ... and the crate comes back to you .
it comes back ?
it' s really ...
denmark .
completely idiotic .
the idiocy embodied in this phenomenon tells you everything about the efficiency of this hospital . ...
extra strong lager , too .
no , it isn' t extra strong , it' s ... it' s low alcohol .
low ?
low ?
where does it say that ?
it' s an ordinary beer .
the yellow ... is just like the swedish flag .
an ordinary beer .
aage is a demon .
and a demon is a personification of satan .
demons only come when they are called ...
do you see , bulder ?
yes , no , i mean no ...
somewhere in these buildings someone is calling !
when the plane shot upwards the big building was on our right and to one side was the fountain pond .
so prettily illuminated .
what is that big building called ?
it' s not the hospital .
it' s the masons .
the masonic lodge ?
that' s what we have to get into .
we can' t .
there are lots of tests and things .
not that kind of in .
just where they go in for it .
go in for what ?
where they go in for satan .
thank god for that .
i thought they went in for body building .
and i' m not doing that .
how many years will society have her round its neck ?
70 years ?
70 times , say , half a million .
that' s 35 million .
35 million !
no wonder the tax payers feel cheated , eh ?
go back to your den , hook , mona doesn' t need this .
no , darling , not now .
she doesn' t understand a word of it .
i don' t want to hear it either .
lovely , eh ?
having the entire hospital at your beck and call ?
but luckily some people have begun listening to what i have to say .
don' t feel too safe , my dear .
yuck , damn you !
mummy !
the entire hospital is going crazy .
it' s getting to be beyond me .
it can' t be stopped ; all you can do is look out for your dear ones .
aage offered to save you , and you said no .
don' t you see that the only thing that matters is keeping you alive ?
and if it' s on your father' s terms , so what ?
what do good and evil matter if you' re dead ?
lf i have to live my life without my baby ?
all my life i wanted a baby .
i' ve been waiting for you all my life .
i know it' s hard for you , mummy .
it' s really horrid .
of course resisting gets harder and harder the more it hurts .
but if father could do this to me and you , and do all he has done to the kingdom , what might his kind do to the rest of the world ?
i don' t care about the rest of the world .
yes , today and maybe tomorrow .
but not for always .
my death is so infinitely small .
it hurts me and you .
but there are only the two of us , and the world is so big , so big , as you have sung for me .
i beg you to help me do it .
lf you love me , you can let me be the one to decide .
can' t you mend it ?
it' s all worn out .
wow , how super !
people can wear out , too .
so can love for children and grownups and goodness and friendship , all these things can wear out and break down .
then slightly right .
lf you hit the crash barrier just straighten up without getting scared .
driving blindfold into the oncoming traffic without getting scared ?
i' il tell you when you reach the bridge .
now !
then you use your wipers .
now you can see .
you head for home like you' ve done before ...
piece of cake .
christian , i think i' ve got something .
remember the rumours about helmer plagiarising in lund ?
i' ve got the writer' s phone number .
he' il have some dirt on helmer .
christian ?
sanne ...
sanne ...
you were so mad about falcon .
but i don' t dare any more .
i' m afraid .
and the terrible thing is , the money' s promised to someone .
you see ?
am i boring ?
am i boring because i don' t dare do it ?
i like you the way you are .
you don' t have to be anyone else .
just be a good doctor .
that' s how you must make your money .
i' d like to talk to dr. jnsson .
ahah ?
he' s coming in tomorrow morning ?
l' il try again tomorrow morning , ja .
because it is very important , very important .
to get to the lodge you go back to bleachpond road .
mummy !
the pendulum wants to go this way .
emergency exlt
mummy ...
take a lamp , bulder .
mummy , this can' t be the masons .
no , we' re far too deep .
downwards !
let the weak perish that the strong may reign in the chaos of darkness !
come on , bulder !
what a mess !
yes , and it' s going to get worse .
it is hard to decline such power .
may i stay here a bit ?
god , i was scared .
and really i am not the one you should fear .
i can take the pain away .
and death .
together we can save your child , judith .
it takes but a word .
how vexing !
he' s gone .
no , he' s taken the lift .
he' s getting off at neurosurgery .
the evil could be me .
yes , maybe it is us .
maybe it isn' t .
and our uncertainty is the beauty of it all .
it' s a very interesting situation if someone from our very own neurosurgery ward is in the evil camp .
bulder , it' s time to play .
play ?
yes , we' re going to play associations .
a trip deep into the subconscious .
archibald and i used to play .
the dirty old man !
one person says a word and the other person responds with another without pause for thought .
the trick is that the response can be extremely revealing .
the hierarchy of hell is tremendously important .
rather like it is here .
lf i can sneak in the name of one of the rulers of hell ... ... such as beelzebub , who attained the rank of grand duc
i may be sure it will pay off .
the evil one , who has the correct imprinted knowledge , will be unable to refrain from responding with his own rank .
let' s try it , bulder .
mummy , there' s nothing imprinted in me .
you don' t say ...
just say the first word that enters your mind .
let' s begin .
green .
beer bottle .
yes .
see how easy it is ?
car .
repairs .
gin ?
tonic .
biscuits .
under the cupboard .
i told you you' d taken them .
you see , it works .
but whom shall we try it out on ?
who from neurosurgery could be the evil one ?
yes , it' il be quite a job doing the whole hospital like this .
but i can' t think of a better method of paring away the worst of the hospital' s fat .
i saw helmer
can we be friends again now , mummy ?
i' m sorry , darling .
of course we can be friends .
i love you .
but no more silly talk about me doing anything to you , eh ?
i won' t ask you to do anything , i promise .
oh , maybe you could get some more cotton buds to moisten my lips ?
of course , darling .
i should' ve realised .
i can' t take any more , mummy .
why didn' t you tell me it hurt so much ?
mummy ...
darling ...
it' s no good .
mummy , i want to be your little baby .
from now on , you make the decisions .
sleep an hour or two .
we' il talk about it when you wake up .
i can' t get hold of that jnsson bloke .
my viva is any minute .
i feel like hell .
exercise , mogge .
use the adrenaline to move about .
lnstead of making you nervous ...
who shall we try ?
does anyone here look suspicious ?
l think the dark side requires a modicum of intelligence .
hook looks funny .
his trip to the crematorium did him no good .
but he' s not our man .
he helped us with mary .
pear tree .
ldiot .
little blue balloons ?
tiedown .
beelzebub ?
compulsory lobotomy .
stig ?
stig ?
bondo needs a marrow transplant .
sadly , sadly , sadly .
i' d love to help , but i' ve got a viva .
they can' t find a donor .
he' s no relatives , poor man .
he won' t survive unless they find someone .
mummy , shall we ...
bulder , my boy , i have something to tell you .
yes ?
what ?
something i have kept to myself for years .
let' s go to my room .
i want you seated .
it' s about your father .
my father ?
yes , but sit down first .
don' t you ever do as you' re told ?
never mind who i am .
i want to give you a tipoff .
i think the girl is trying to tell you something .
let mona play with her bricks .
she' il tell you something important about dr. helmer .
but get a move on , while she' s still fairly lucid .
stop , you old reprobate !
helmer , damn it , we' il be late !
had you forgotten that we have to haul moesgaard' s son through ?
how about picking a question ?
very good .
an interesting choice .
it' s always good to reach out into the periphery of the syilabus .
right , mogge , how much can you tell us about amylase ?
amylase ?
yes .
all that remains is to decide on your grade .
has dr. jnsson arrived ?
he has ?
thank you .
hello , this is mogens moesgaard from the kingdom , copenhagen .
i' m inquiring about your former boss , stig helmer .
i understand there were a few ... how shall i put it ... problems .
can you tell me anything about him that i don' t know ?
you' d be happy to ?
cooeee !
bondo !
listen !
i' ve got good news and bad news .
the good news is that we' ve found your half brother .
and he' s compatible .
and he' s agreed to donate marrow .
it turns out that he works at the hospital .
let me see him !
yes , well ...
what does he specialise in ?
i' m already looking forward to swapping theories with him .
let me see him , this bearer of the thousandyearold bondo intellect !
well , that' s the bad news .
hi .
bro .
ls he tired ?
come along .
yes ?
you are horrid and selfish .
let me stop for a moment ...
you must say thank you .
this is for your own sake .
you' re the one who needs a lesson .
come on .
bastard .
thank you .
say thank you after she' s hit you .
yes , come on .
thank you .
oh , excuse me a moment .
i think my awakening is on its way .
thanks to all of you .
i feel the need to be alone .
einar , what are you feeling ?
anger .
with whom ?
all of them .
what are they doing ?
stopping me .
from what ?
all i want to do for myself .
and what is that ?
to be a doctor .
say that again ?
to be a doctor .
i' il tell them that i' ve had enough .
i want my money back .
and my clothes .
then i' il return to my ward , my management duties .
and my hospital .
bob ?
here i come !
i' il tell them to their faces that a moesgaard wishes to speak .
a moesgaard walks upright .
a moesgaard does not flee in the dark down two sheets tied together !
i' ve considered what you said .
that it seemed to be a setup .
i have the same nasty feeling .
aha ?
what can we do ?
lf the lodge really is behind it all , i wouldn' t recommend sanctions .
the lodge is not to be trifled with .
you think we should bow to the lodge and do nothing ?
i' d advise you to call off tonight' s patrol .
so as not to provoke them .
provoke them ?
precisely .
go home .
that' s what i' d do .
by the way , my compliments on being such a great man .
what do you mean ?
the article in this week' s medical journal where they debate whether this hospital needs a dg at all seeing as the place is run by the consultants .
splendid of you not to stoop to a defence !
thank you , nivesen .
a fine move , dg .
the journal , you say ?
yes .
good night .
i' ve never found it so hard to agree .
for moesgaard' s sake i' d give him a 7 and just pass him .
i admit that he was somewhat incoherent .
but less than a 7 has never been awarded to a lodge member' s son .
don' t fail him with less than a 3 !
all right , if you say so .
let' s stop here .
no !
helmer ...
we couldn' t give you much .
may i pass on greetings to my external examiner ?
8 personal greetings from the village of bors .
jnsson ...
we could only give you a 3 .
i hate mediocrity .
party discipline on the local council back home taught me to hate .
i am a duck , i am a duck , i am a duck , i know it .
lt' s got to be an 11 , cum laude .
lf you say so , helmer .
he' s here .
hi , bro !
let' s extract that marrow !
the last dance before we go home
before the sun again does roam
still i hold you close
still the night is ours
lovely the last dance
before we go i meet your lips
before we go home
for a brief second before we go home
the night is over
i whisper goodnight
l kiss you see you soon
i have never
felt heaven as close as now .
at christmas it shall come to pass .
our time will soon be over .
will you marry me ?
yes , i will .
good .
a two ?
well done , mogge .
there' s no such thing as a 2 .
only 0 or 3 .
mogge thinks you' re brave to have come here .
yes , i' m ready now .
sanne !
come on ...
there .
i' il run you home .
i' ve got dad' s car .
you need to get your strength back .
what a buzz !
an 11 !
helmer was
helmer ...
helmer ...
good morning .
there !
the staircase .
hello , camilla .
how is your son ?
fine , thanks , they' ve finished .
he always takes his time sleeping it off .
the anaesthetic ?
ln this case .
i' m so confused , i can' t get anything right .
i' ve developed a method ... a game of associations .
it tells one so much about people .
yes , i' ve played it a lot .
it' s great fun .
yes , because people give you such different answers .
i mean , what would you say to bubble and squeak ?
leftovers ?
how about orangutan ?
dr. helmer .
sorry , i don' t know what got into me .
oh , dear , how funny !
prawn cocktail .
thousand island .
emu ?
three letter animal .
the hebrides ?
stiff nor' westerly .
how about beelzebub ?
grand duc .
what did you say ?
you said beelzebub .
so i replied grand duc .
beelzebub , grand duc , lucifer ,
empereur , satanachia ,
grand general .
what have you done ?
accursed bitch !
good evening .
i' m the dg and i' m making an inspection .
nobody is to stop me !
no , of course not .
first , the minister .
i don' t think he' s here .
maybe he' s been discharged ?
but dg , sir !
it is unlocked .
it opens outwards .
it' s the new kind ... at your suggestion .
so we could get more beds in .
stop !
i have some management questions .
i am the dg .
hey , stop ! ...
surely i can handle the patients ...
that' s an order !
sorry , but i' ve very little time .
stop , stop !
at once !
i' il get you !
this is the police .
what have you done with the girl ?
i am the highest authority in this hospital .
you' re a consultant ?
open up !
ln the name of the law !
frightened ...
frightened ...
frightened ...
grown ups can be frightened , too .
can i be of service ?
a mistake .
we thought you' d taken ...
i mean ...
yes ?
what ?
the girl was missing .
and you ran ...
yes , ran ...
i don' t know if it' s the right word .
but efficiency isn' t illegal here , or what does the dg say ?
it' s a disciplinary offence not to move laundry to the laundry , and nowhere else .
thank you .
it seems the good mrs drusse is late so let' s get started .
i' ve mugged up on this kind of tomfoolery .
we have to decide whom to invoke .
the dg' s better self ?
bob' s better self ?
it won' t be easy .
let' s try ... ls our central medium ready ?
come on , bob !
come on , bob ...
come on , bob ...
are you awake now ?
what is going to happen , mummy ?
have you made up your mind ?
an hour ago i was sure i' d do a deal with aage .
i was about to call him when i remembered what drusse said about the spirits .
that when one was ready , one could see them .
so i came up here and all at once
i really could see them .
i understand now what you said , that we are all part of something greater and the fact that together we belong on the side of good renders everything else insignificant .
they love you , and they trust you .
though you matter more to me than anything in the world ,
i can' t force you to go against your nature and your convictions .
yes .
i will help you to die .
it was for such a brief instant .
but i wouldn' t have done without you for all the world .
mummy ...
yes , my beloved ?
it must be now .
while we still can .
i' d like to baptise you .
then i should like to be called frederik , like the crown prince .
babies who do not live to bear a name are given the king' s name .
of course you shall have the king' s name .
i baptise you frederik .
ln the name of the father , the son and the holy spirit .
thank you , mummy .
i thank you , frederik .
no , not by injection , mummy .
i dare not .
i don' t want to be asleep when it happens .
release me , mummy .
you must release me , mummy .
do you think we can do it ?
i know we can do it .
together .
i can' t do it .
you can .
i love you , mummy .
sing for me .
the sun is so red , mummy
and the forest black
now the sun is dead , mummy ...
no !
oh !
hello ? ...
can anyone hear me ?
i can' t open the door .
hey , hook !
he' s about to start .
falcon is about to go .
i' ve put a month' s wages on him .
take over for ten minutes , ok ?
we' re about to test the emergency power supply .
the mains will cut out and the generators will cut in .
just turn the mains power back on via the red button if the generator fails to start .
but it always does .
don' t touch anything else , specially the big levers .
it' d be easy to exterminate the weaker patients .
falcon , are you ready ?
we' re ready here .
5000 on red .
no , i' il put it on black .
i don' t think he' il make it today .
not blind . ... 5 , 4 , 3 , 2 , 1 , go !
this won' t do .
it won' t do at all .
i' ve staked a month' s wages .
and you' re not even cheering .
i don' t like that , shorty .
there he is !
mogge , it' s daddy .
there he is , the bastard !
catch him !
after him !
where in hell did he go ?
he' s screwed us all .
who has ?
moesgaard .
it' s all his fault .
i' il bet it is .
i should' ve known it .
good evening , bob .
director general , i mean .
i' ve damned well had enough .
bob , bob , you' ve had your day the lodge will make you go away ...
like that , is it ?
ls this how you combat the occult ?
this will cost you dear .
