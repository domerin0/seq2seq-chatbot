my firm' s done a tremendous amount of market research .
one , most americans feel that christmas is a time for family .
two , most americans feel that in order to stand being around their family , for even one or two days , they need to swill as much alcohol as humanly possible .
now , i' d like you to meet the noggertons .
they' re a classic american family .
they' re together on christmas , they' re fat free , and 10 percent alcohol by volume .
enjoy our family , so you can enjoy your family .
what do you think ?
so , you' re suggesting we tell people the only way to get through the holidays is to drink spiked egg nog ?
i' m suggesting the only way to get through the holidays is to buy your farm fresh , fat free , pre spiked egg nog in a bottle .
take care .
all right .
it' s all good .
how do you do it ?
i' m very excited .
i look forward to it .
it went pretty well , huh ?
i' m a genius .
i feel like i could sell whale steaks to greenpeace .
nice image .
here are your tickets to fiji .
ah .
missy , we' ve been dating a while .
let' s take our relationship to the next level .
i' ve hoped you would say that .
i got you a little pre christmas christmas gift .
yeah ?
i want you to open it now because it involves our future .
the future of you and me together .
it' s kind of for both of us , in that way .
okay .
tickets to fiji ?
yes .
first class .
drew , on christmas ?
christmas is the family holiday .
i mean , what are we doing ?
what is this ?
i mean , what is going on ?
where is this relationship headed ?
fiji .
first class .
missy ?
uh uh .
okay .
here' s an example of one of our problems .
you never introduced me to your family .
you never mentioned your family .
do you even have a family ?
how can you be serious about me , if you' re not serious about your family ?
you need to get some serious help , drew .
i think you' re missing the point .
if i told you everything about me , there' d be no more sense of mystery .
nothing left to discover .
with nothing left to discover , a relationship dies .
you don' t want this to die , do you ?
it just did .
come on .
don' t be like that .
you' re gonna be like that ?
go ahead .
go .
i' m going to spend christmas with my family .

missy .
kathryn , i need you to get a cartier bracelet to send to missy .

hello .
my name is drew latham .
i grew up in this house .
that' s why you came back and tried to burn it down , pyroboy ?
brian , call the cops .

i can touch the ceiling .
it' s much smaller than i remember it .
did you do something ?
yeah .
we had it reduced .

i think it was worth it .
man , this is great .
man , this is the best .
you guys sittin ' around eatin ' dinner like a family .
i always wanted that .
this is really wonderful .
wonderful .
so , what' s for dessert ?

and you agreed to this ?
without asking me ?
of course i did .
he' s giving us $250, 000 .
how would you like it if i agreed to this without asking you ?
well , that would depend .
would we be getting $250, 000 ?
okay .
what exactly did you agree to ?
it' s a big day for this family .
very well .
all right .
mr. latham agrees to pay the sum of $250, 000 to the valcos for services rendered until 11 : 59 pm on christmas day .
and for said sum , the valco family will aid mr. latham in recapturing those childhood christmas memories ,

we should start over .
here you go , drew .
thanks , mom .
mmm .
problem ?
my real mom puts marshmallows in the hot chocolate .

if you don' t wanna play my sister , maybe you could be , like , a wonderful , mysterious
ecuadorean cleaning lady .
you know ?
or swedish cleaning lady .
the ethnicity' s not important .
but cleaning lady' s good .
oh .
mmm .
what ?
my real mom used the mini marshmallows .
sorry .
speaking of your mom , why aren' t you annoying your own family ?
that' s not really your business , is it , consuela ?
ho , ho , ho !
all righty .
welcome , everyone .
here you are .
what is this ?
these are what we in the business call scripts , tom .
excuse me ?
you don' t have to worry about it .
your role is what we call " small .
well , you' re what we in real life call " a jackass .
i don' t know about that , but i do know that my being here may have caused some awkwardness within the family .
you think ?
i do , tom .
seriously .
and it' s even possible that some of it could potentially be in some small way partly my fault .
which part wasn' t your fault ?
bop , bop , bop , bop .
i' m talking .
okay ?
so what i' ve done is i went ahead and wrote a sequence , so you guys can get a sense of what i' m going for here .
and we' re all gonna read this aloud .
and we' re all gonna read this aloud .
i feel like i' m insane .
that' s why you have no lines .
mom , i believe you go first .
okay .
oh , look at us .
i sure hope you like the meal i so lovingly prepared for the people i love .
she smiles at tom .
oh , she' s ...
have you acted ?
you' ve acted before .
a little theater .
i can tell .
i see it .
it comes out .
you were in " pippin " in high school .
you played wind .
tom , you have the next line .
uh ...
say thank you to your mother for all her hard work cooking for us .
thank you .
oh , i don' t work nearly as hard as you , dear .
well , that' s true .
tom , let' s stay on book , please .
brian , go ahead .
gee , mom , i love you like the dickens .
should we pray ?
gee , beav , do you think wally' s gonna give you the business ?
oh , there you are , consuela .
five waters for everyone , please .
gracias .
brian , you were about to say grace .
" dear god ...
brian .
we hold hands at grace .
dear god , thank you for this meal .
thank you for blessing us with a family .
not everyone has a nice family .
and also we , o lord , are so lucky to have drew in our lives .
amen .
an emotional moment .
sorry , i keep doing that .
brian , if you eat it all up , i will let you sleep with me
like i never did when you were little .
an awkward moment .
skip ahead .
that doesn' t work .
that' s not supposed to be there .
what does this mean ?
doo dah enters in his bathrobe .
sweet jim jiminy !
cold corn in the mornin ' !
this weather is killin ' my joints .
brian , go get the shovel .
listen to me .
when alicia came , she totally ruined everything .
everything was so normal up until that point .
silencio , por favor .
so i realized what i had to do was expand the family .
i had to find my grandpa .
so i went and found my doo dah .
here he is .
my doo dah .
your doo dah looks exactly like the guy in " christmas carol . " scrooge .
that' s right .
i do community theater .
and this christmas night , i' m reprising my role as scrooge in the lincoln wood theater group' s production of " a christmas carol .
i hope you all can make it .

but if i eat this thing , i can' t act not dead .
hey !
slow down .
the roads are icy .
i don' t want you to kill your family !
perfect , christine .
that' s what my mom would' ve said .
good improv .
before your father threw her out of the car .
ah , the old carriage house .
brings back memories .
what' s going on ?
brian , go inside .
what ?
come on !
dad .
i' m in my pajamas .
you want me to sleep outside ?
go .
fine .
i can' t go in my room , i get ...
you know , when i become a serial killer don' t act surprised .
think positive , bris eye .
use your positive mindset .
that' s not what we talked about .
it' s hard to get through to him .
so what' s goin ' on ?
what' s up ?
you gotta go .
what ?
we can' t do this no more .
what do you mean ?
what can' t we do ?
christine and i , we' re thinkin ' about breakin ' up .
what ?
why ?
is it my fault ?
something i did ?
is it the hat ?
forget it .
wear whatever you want , tom .
it' s not you .
it' s nothin ' to do with you .
it' s been goin ' on for a long time .
we' re just ...
it' s not workin ' out .
we were gonna wait till after the holidays to tell the kids , and you know , with you here , and with your christmas cheer crap , it' s making it worse .
tom , first of all , i wanna reward you for opening up with a big " thank you , " that deserves some credit .
second , let me tell you what you need to do .
if i was you and comin ' into some money ,
i' d do somethin ' big , somethin ' you always wanted your whole life .
somethin ' that makes you happy .
i want the money .
i really do .
it' s christine , she keeps ...
all right .
let me worry about christine , okay ?
i' il worry about christine .
you worry about tom , ' cause it' s tom time .
christine ?
yes , dear ?
can i talk to you ?
of course , dear .
i' m your mother .
you can talk to me about anything .
great .
are you all right ?
uh huh .
you sure ?
' cause you just put a bra in brian' s sock drawer .
oh , well , that' s your brother .
15 .
likes to experiment .
we still love him .
look , christine , i know what' s going on with you and tom , and first of all , i just wanna say that
i' m feeling a little ripped off here , you know ?
i thought i was getting a real family .
this is bullshit .
well , it' s time you grew up and faced facts , isn' t it ?
mommies and daddies fall in love , make babies , pay bills , get mad , and stop touching each other !
second of all ,
i was thinkin ' i could do something to help you , make you feel better .
how about just me and you go shopping ?
for what ?
i don' t know .
just go shopping .
you know what i mean ?
it' s fun just to buy shit .
listen , i know all the best makeup and hair people .
the best fashion photographer in chicago owes me huge !
so ?
you don' t see it , do you ?
you don' t see what a beautiful woman you are .
you have grace and kindness and sensuality , and this incredibly striking , kind of offbeat beauty that' s ...
you look in the mirror , and don' t see it .
we' re gonna show you .
how would you like me to arrange your very own , very hip , very sexy , yet tasteful , very elegant , very modern , very expensive photo shoot , just for you ?
or not .
i mean , whatever ...
oh , drew , you' ve made your mama so happy .
great .
oh , mom .
hey , alicia .
want to go tobogganing ?
oh , i' m sorry , drew .
have i been sending you mixed signals ?
i just thought maybe instead of sitting around bickering and hating me , you might like to have some fun .
no , thanks .
ah , i see .
i get it .

actually , part of me thinks that it' s incredibly stupid , and the other part is in agreement .
there you go .
you' re chicken .
know what i think ?
what ?
i think that you had no intention of going down this hill .
i think that you dragged us up here because you knew we wouldn' t go down it .
i think you were showing off .

uh huh .
she' s my cherry pie ]
hey .
hi .
you look different .
did you do something ?
are you serious ?
no , i just mean that ... ... you look good .

yeah .
does it seem at all familiar ?
didn' t somebody we know have one of these ?
yeah .
us .
maybe this' il help .
yeah .
i remember .
so what' s your deal anyway ?
my deal .
i mean , sometimes you have these moments of lucidity , but then other times it' s just not so much normal .
i don' t understand , i mean , i don' t wanna be alone on christmas .
you' ve never been alone .
on christmas , it' s not like being alone .
it' s alone alone .
this wouldn' t be one of those lucid moments .
i wasn' t going for that .
okay , i see .
all right , little miss grinch .
i know you' re a sophisticated , modern woman that' s very jaded and nothing gets to you , and you have no emotions .
but i' d be willing to bet that even you , before you got old ... ... er than you are now , but still as young , attractive , smart and beautiful ... [ sniffling ]
that' s better .
i don' t know , like , some moment in your childhood before everything got complicated , when you were happy .
you must have some moment in your life that you' d like to go back and relive .
yeah .
once ,
i was , like , nine years old and we had just had this ice storm .
i was walking home from school through bishop park .
you know that one big oak tree in the middle ?
it was completely frozen .
all the branches were icicles .
it was just ...
it was incredible .
it completely stopped me in my tracks .
i remember standing underneath it pretending that i was a princess in a magical crystal palace .
it was really ...
it was beautiful .
feliz navidad ]
hey , would you come outside with me for one second ?
i wanna show you something .
okay .
where are you taking me ?
hold on , one second .
you trust me ?
uh , no .
not necessarily .
okay .
try to trust me , i wanna blindfold you .
it' s a surprise .
okay .
all right ?
all right .
oh , god .
all right .
follow me .
i feel that this is gonna end with " and she was never heard from again .
step , step , step .
okay .
right there .
stop .
okay .
turn this way .
okay ?
all right .
all right .
oh , my god .
i can' t believe you did this .
wait till you see this .
hit it , guys .
hut , hut , hut ...
you see that ?
that' s you right there .
i know this props guy .
he owns a prop house with figurines , and he painted your hair like that , your mouth .
those guys aren' t pros .
i' m sure .
i showed them the thing .
oh , wow .
i got this dance teacher .
it' s not easy to get a camel .
it' s not easy taking a very personal and private moment that i have never told anybody and turning it into a theme park .
we wish you a merry christmas
shut up !
ah ...
but i' m not disappointed .
okay ?
i' m not mad .
i' m just mad at myself for thinking that there was more to you than i thought .
that' s you .
it' s a wrap .
hut , hut , hut .
alicia ?
wait a second !
i care about you .
i did that because i care about you .
look , drew , let me just give you some advice .
save your big , expensive gestures for some girl who' s impressed by them ,
and when you find her , hold on to her .
otherwise , you are looking at a lifetime of lonely christmases .
i' m telling you , he is wonderful .
it' s cartier .
at least he' s got manners .
well , i mean , he' s in the neighborhood .
he is ?
darling .
what ?
it' s a day bracelet .
do you like it , darling ?
i love it .
you' re the expert on jewelry .
are you disagreeing ?
absolutely not .
she just got a present .
why pick at her now ?
i' m not .
brian , tell drew that i had to take off .
there was a ...
holy cow .
what are you looking at ?
this is just , it' s research .
when i was young , we didn' t sit in our rooms drooling over nude ladies on computers .
no , sir .
we had to go behind the barn with the dirty girl and pay her a quarter so she could show us her goodies .
how does this work ?
oh , well .
here , let me ...
what are you into ?
hot cheerleaders ,
three way fun .
uh uh .
middle aged hotties .
you' re talkin ' my language .
old enough to know how it' s done , young enough to still want to do it .
that' s gross .
ooh .
come to papa .
that' s not bad , right ?
dude , it' s your mom !
oh , my god .
hey , can you print that for me ?
mom , dad , listen .
please , drew has to go tonight .
i cannot spend one more second in this house with him .
well , yeah ?
yeah ?
so what ?
so he' s making fools of us !
of all of us !
alicia ?
all right , look , i' m gonna take the car , and when i get home , i really hope he' s gone .
alicia .
be careful with the car .
can' t we talk about this ?
no .
what the hell happened ?
nothing .
i think she' s right .
it' s stupid .
this is a mistake .
i' ve imposed on you folks and i' m sorry .
i' il write you a check .
i' il spend christmas ...
i' il spend christmas somewhere .
no .
we don' t want your money .
in cash .
check' il be just fine .

i talked to your secretary and she said you were with your family .
oh , drew !
i am so happy for you .
and for us .
for us ?
" i know what this means , " reaching out to your family .
you want to be more serious about yourself , and more serious about me .
i wanna meet your family , drew .
i' m sure you will , and they wanna meet you one day .
oh , great .
then we can go to fiji .

fiji ?
tomorrow ?
you' re kidding .
that' s fabulous , actually .
that' s perfect .
then tonight we can spend christmas eve together with our families .
ah ...
that' s gonna be hard to pull off , you know ?
it' s very short notice , and we ...
one of the family members is challenged , and ... [ clears throat ] ... requires a lot of time to put on
the proper headgear ...
oh .

there' s no little dingle .
nope .

you can' t see it , because it was so long that mom had to tuck it back when she gave me a bath .
it got tangled .

i came back here because i wanted to apologize to you .
yes , the thing in the park was a bit garish and obnoxious , but that' s you .

i thought this was because you had a painful childhood .
i' m sorry .
you said you never wanted to see me , so i accepted that .
i was broken up with her , but she showed up and wanted to meet my family .
i couldn' t tell them it was a rented family .
i know you hate me .
i hate me .
i hate my own guts .
i know this is horrible , but would you just please , could you help me , so i can get through this ?
you' il never see me again .

your parents will call you when it' s clear .

they think it' s fun , huh ?
maybe they' re right .
your tree , christine , it' s so colorful .
your tree , christine , it' s so colorful .

it' s so bright and vulgar .
mom !
dad !
i' m home !
alicia , you' re back .
you' re back , alicia .
oh , you' re back .
this is our daughter , alicia .
this is mrs. vangilder .

letitia .
i' m so pleased to meet you .
really .
and this is our little missy .
oh , missy , missy .
oh , gosh .
i' ve just heard so much about you from drew .
god , you' re gorgeous .
and you are so not fat .
drew !
what' s the matter with you ?
i' m sorry ?
drew , i' m not fat .
no .
i was just thinking that .
you must be mr. vangilder .
i would never say that .
don' t mind us .
we' re a bunch of kidders .
i like the family .
oh , well , you obviously haven' t met brian .
by the way , where is brian ?
here .
your mom' s startin ' to like your grandfather hittin ' on her .
there' s one you don' t often hear on christmas eve .
it' s unbelievable .
poor thing .
poor thing .
excuse me .
it' s true .
what' s happening over here ?
what' s going on ?
i' m learning so much from your sister .
oh , you are .
great .
i didn' t know you were a baton twirler .
yeah .
gave away the big secret , i guess , didn' t you ?
oh , not the big one , so don' t push me .
let' s go talk to doo dah .
he' s telling stor ...
i want you to see the bracelet drew got me .
ooh , cartier , huh ?
wow .
look at that .
that' s just beautiful .
well , that' s my brother .
just never afraid to put a price tag on his feelings .
yeah .
that' s my sister .
never understanding there' s love , you can care and want to show it in a big way , and you shouldn' t be put down and mocked , and made hurt feelings .
when you love somebody , you don' t have to show it in a big way .
so you were slumming when you were making out with me in the kitchen ?
it' s a very , very affectionate family .
we show our love .
italians .
we' re just very warm .
red hot , even .
all right , that' s it .
give me this .
get up .
sit down !
okay !
who wants a tour of the house ?
what you' re using are stairs .
we like these for going up .
this is the bathroom .
what are you doing to me ?
what ?
you' re killing me .
no , i' m just playing along , brother .
i think missy likes me .
she thinks i' m funny .
this was little drew' s room .
now , it' s brian' s .
aw .
brian , don' t be rude .
we have guests .
he' d live in front of the screen if we' d let him right , tom ?
it' s that insatiable appetite for knowledge .
oh , shit !
brian , what have you done ? !
tom , i don' t know what that is .
i do .
it' s my wife shooting a " v " for victory with her legs .
it' s been a while , but that' s what it looks like .
honestly .
that' s my little girl .
horace , get our coats .
what' s going on ?
you have no idea .
missy , get your coat !
there' s ham !
we' re not going .
we' il stay .
lighten up .
it' s just a picture .
i had pictures taken for fun .
where would you get that stupid idea ? !
coats !
someone say coats ?
get the coats .
gotta get coats .
oh .
some things cannot be unseen .
brian ?
brian ?
great .
just great , christine .
i' il be at the travel lodge .
merry christmas .
mom ?
mom ?
oh , dear god .
wait a minute !
there' s more of mom' s buffet .
if you think we' re staying after that display , think again .
trollops who pose for dirty pictures , various incestuous overtones and old , unexplained men .
this is without a doubt the worst christmas i' ve ...
oh , shut up , letitia !
what ?
i' il tell you what .
i' ve put up with your high and mighty act for 25 years , but they don' t have to .
i don' t remember you being superior when you got knocked up by skippy altsheller and then tricked me into marrying you .
oh , my god !
i' m sorry , missy .
missy , darling , it' s not true .
you were premature .
oh , come on , letitia !
tell your mother thanks , drew .
and merry christmas .
missy , we' il wait for you in the car .
you know , really .
yuletide' s a bitch , ain' t it ?
oh , shut up !
just shut up !
okay !
fiji .
let' s go to fiji right now .
you' re right , drew .
just screw family .
all we need is each other .
just take me away .
i' m sorry , missy .
i can' t .
just go home , okay ?
i' m sorry about all this .
i' il spend christmas alone .
oh , fine .
okay .
well , then ... ... the only thing i have left to say to you is i am keeping this bracelet .
i feel bad drinking liquor you' re gonna need .
i better go .
merry christmas .
all right .
missy , get in the car !
my god !
have you lost your mind ?
did you just lose it in there ?
you know , i have to ask , just how bad is your real family that you would rather spend your christmas like this ?
there was no real family .
what do you mean , " there is no family " ?
you must' ve had a family .
i mean , you must' ve had a doo dah , right ?
i had a friend whose grandfather , was called doo dah .
i always liked that .
my dad walked out on us on christmas when i was four .
it was basically just me and my mom .
she was a waitress at the 24 hour coffee shop .
she didn' t have a lot of money , so when christmas came around , it was an opportunity for her to take a double shift .
she did .
and , you know , my christmases were , basically , i just kind of sat around the house , you know ?
then at night , i' d walk down there , and mom would always buy me a grown up stack of pancakes , and i would sit by myself at the end of the counter and eat ' em .
i did that for christmas every year until i turned 18 .
i haven' t been able to walk in a coffee shop since , though .
where' s your mom now ?
mom died when i was in college .
i' m sorry .
you know what ?
there' s nothing that you can do about those christmases .
but the one that you can do something about , the one that' s here and now , you just spent that destroying my family .
alicia , just for the record ,
i didn' t destroy your family .
what are you talking about ?
your parents are splitting up .
it' s obvious .
brian knows it .
that' s why he spends all his time in his room on his computer .
you just didn' t wanna see it .
i can understand that .
i' m gonna go get my dad .
lock up when you leave .
well , all right .
i forgive you .
no !
no , spirit !
no !
i will honor christmas in my heart and try to keep it all the year .
no one' s home !
what ?
i hear you .
are you gonna hit me ?
no .
are you gonna do something else that still hurts ?
no .
you gonna invite me in ?
you just stopped by to hang out and catch up ?
reminisce ?
you owe me money .
right .
the money .
okay , come on in .
i' il get my checkbook .
you rented my place when you could' ve been staying here ?
well , i gotta admit , this is nice .
thanks .
you still splitting up with christine ?
yeah .
i guess .
that would be a shame .
what are you laughing at ?
nothing .
it' s just ironic .
i paid all that money to be part of your family .
you' re giving it away for nothing .
look at this .
that' s the ticket to doo dah' s play .
yeah .
i got mine too .
i' m not very good at apologizing .
i don' t know if they' re in there .
come on .
what do you have to lose ?
what do you want with me ?
much .
who are you ?
in life , i was your partner ...
see anybody ?
that' s doo dah right there .
what is the reason for this visit ?
it is getting late and i' ve been hard at work .
he' s not that bad .
to warn you , ebenezer .
he' s not that good either .
i' m gonna find christine .
learn from me .
my spirit never walked beyond our counting house .
it never roved beyond our money changing hole .
so i am condemned to wander through the world to see what i might have shared on earth , then turned to happiness .
what are you doing here ?
you were always a good businessman .
doo dah' s family , right ?
brian .
it' s me , move over .
no , man .
go find one of the other empty seats .
move over , bri .
come on .
where' s your sister ?
shh .
dear brother !
fanny !
christine ...
if i were to leave , i wouldn' t even know where to go .
then why leave ?
that' s what i' m sayin ' .
i don' t wanna leave .
then don' t .
all right , i won' t .
okay .
is that all right ?
yeah .
it' s good .
bri , that girl ...
she' s kinda cute for you .
talk to her .
stop it .
she' s gonna hear .
i saw you looking at her .
stop .
i can tell you like ...
i can hear you .
that' s embarrassing .
that' s our grandfather .
this is brian .
there , brian .
you' re all set .
i' m sorry .
is that your brother ?
yeah .
how do we travel exactly ?
through the air .
we fly !
not so hard !
wedgie !
wedgie !
alicia ?
hey .
hey .
were you in there the whole time ?
no .
i was just here to pick up my mom .
she' s in there with your dad .
they' re kinda making out in the third row .
really ?
yeah .
that' s good .
look .
i don' t expect you to want to talk to me or anything , so i' m not gonna bother you and give you a hard time , camp outside your place and stalk you and you know .
but i do want to say that i' m sorry for what i put you through and say thank you .
so who are you renting for new year' s
' cause you know , us valcos , we book up kind of fast .
i see that .
and i' d get on it if i were you .
i' m lookin ' for a family with maybe a bearded , irascible dad with a heart of gold .
a brother who stays in his room all the time by himself , and a sister who is ... ... wonderful and smart , and really beautiful .
because i think that' s the kind of person that ... ... i could fall in love with .
you know anybody like that ?
i know it' s tough .
let me think .
