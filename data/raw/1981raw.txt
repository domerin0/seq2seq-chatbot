a case to end all cases .
you know what i mean , dinah ?
i used to think being a private detective was cool .
like sam spade or phillip marlowe , right ?
but there' s nothing cool left to it .
on top of that , both my fridge and my bank account are empty .
wait .
okay , dinah , let' s bet .
if it' s another suspicious husband , i' m out of this business forever .
hello ?
mr. ash , i have a job for you .
and you need me to check on your wife , right ?
i' m looking for a computer hacker .
this hacker goes by the alias trinity .
that' s all we know .
well , it looks like we' re still in business , dinah .
fine .
and who will i be working for ?
i can' t say .
you can' t say .
call me back when you can say .
that' s not the way i do business .
it was a pleasure chatting with you .
before you hang up , take a look at your bank account balance .
i didn' t get a good feeling about the case .
but i had no good reason to turn the guy down now .
this trinity was well known in hacker circles .
a real artist by the sound of it .
the cops were always one step behind him .
so i knew i could get that close .
question was , could i get closer ?
i had a few tricks up my sleeve for getting to hackers .
while i was searching , i found something strange .
other detectives had been on the case too .
and their investigations had all been , shall we say , troubled .
one of the guys killed himself .
another had disappeared .
another went crazy .
so i paid the one who was left a visit .
the crazy one .
trinity doesn' t exist , man .
he' s not real .
he' s a figment .
a cipher .
a jabberwocky .
and who am i ?
who the hell am i ?
did i mention he was crazy ?
chessboards , jabberwocky , red queen ...
i started searching all the usual hacker hangouts ... ... for someone with an alice in wonderland m . o .
hacker bulletin boards , anonymous mailboxes , chat rooms .
and it was in one of those that i picked up trinity' s trail .
six brooks .
i' il be there at 2005 .
of course !
crossing the second brook takes her into the woods .
alice jumps the first brook ... ... and ...
and then she boards a train .
thanks .
excuse me .
hey !
hey !
i knew this was some kind of trap .
there' s a difference , mr. ash , between a trap and a test .
you were testing me ?
you made it .
i' m impressed .
flattery will get you everywhere .
i' m not here to flatter you , i' m here to save you .
what just happened ?
mr. ash , dream of having an eye exam lately ?
yeah , how' d you know ?
you' ve stepped to the edge of the looking glass .
so then , that means i wasn' t dreaming .
they hired me as a way of getting to you , didn' t they ?
go !
what the hell is going on here ?
this is really crazy .
now i understand what happened to those other detectives .
they went nuts .
what are you doing ?
what are you doing , guys ?
well , i' ve gotten out of worse jams than this .
i am not gonna let them get you .
what' s happening to me ?
i' m sorry .
you didn' t make it , mr. ash .
i wish ... ... i could go with you .
i don' t blame you , you know .
everything that happened , trinity , it was all my fault .
all that through the looking glass stuff .
can' t get my head around it .
i' m old fashioned .
there' s a difference between a test and a choice .
for what it' s worth , i think you could' ve handled the truth .
it was just a job .
goodbye , trinity .
goodbye .
a case to end all cases .
