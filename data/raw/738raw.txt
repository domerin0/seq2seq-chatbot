hey , who saw <i>yentl ? </ i>
so barbra streisand wants to study the <i>talmud, </ i> right ?
but , she can' t because she' s a woman , so she pretends to be a man , and , uh , one thing leads to the next , and before you know it
uh everybody everybody believes that she' s a man .
so she has to keep lying even though she wants to stop , she can' t ,
' cause she has to keep lying to people that she cares about .
you know , that have been really kind .
look , uh , we' re women .
no , you don' t get it .
