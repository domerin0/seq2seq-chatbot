i' m late , come on , come on .
i need to bounce some ideas off you .
mine are all boring , done it , been there .
hey , ike !
when are you guys gonna stop waking me up every morning ?
when your column stops putting me to sleep .
funny , funny .
yo , jonah !
fisher , come on !
are you really not there ?
all right , cool .
i' il talk to you later .
excuse me .
i' m thinking of doing an article about limousines .
what do you think about people who' ve never been in one ?
i don' t know people like that .
i need someone to bounce some ideas off of and get the juices flowing .
i got one hour , 27 minutes , 52 seconds .
hey , ike !
when are you gonna put me in a column ?
when your t shirts stop shrinking .
shrinks ?
funny .
he' s kidding .
he' s just kidding .
oh , forget it .
here , give me $5 .
give me $2 .
no way .
folks , i got nice shirts here .
look !
i love everybody .
you' re next . " % [ female singing ]
so what' s in store for us in tomorrow' s column ?
i don' t know yet .
i' m , uh , kind of a last minute man .
you know , till an hour or two before deadline , i don' t get any ideas .
so you get your ideas for your column from life .
start up a conversation with a woman in a bar .
attack her dart playing and try to get a rise out of her ... while you contemplate whether or not she' s worth hitting on .
no , i can' t hit on you till i get an idea .
wh that' s flattering .
no , you don' t understand .
i understand .
see , my not responding to you baiting me ... will inspire one of those bitter diatribes you like to write about women .
i don' t write bitter diatribes about women .
oh ho .
very often .
i could .
only when the ideas aren' t flowing , huh ?
it' s so nice to meet you , one minute man .
it' s last minute man .
whatever .
want to hear something funny ?
for a good looking guy , you strike out a lot .
have you noticed that ?
i bet it' s your ex wife .
excuse me .
i' ve seen much worse .
no , ike' s not here .
i say , i' ve seen much worse .
i' il tell him when he comes in .
excuse me ?
the brush off .
i' ve witnessed far more ... treacherous and nefarious exits than that .
at least she castigated you in private .
not as private as i thought .
kevin , you got some napkins there ?
wiping or writing ?
i' il let you know .
they love you .
they hate you .
they' re hot .
they' re cold .
they' re high .
they' re up .
they' re down .
this is fun making a list with you , but i do have a column to write .
ike .
but you have yet to find a really superb idea .
there' s a girl from my hometown that you could write about .
excuse me , but we don' t need any ideas .
she likes to dump grooms at the altar .
they call her the " runaway bride .
she' s performed the travesty seven or eight times .
turns around , runs like hell .
bolts .
adios .
plows down the aisle , knocking old ladies out of her way ...
like the running of the bulls in pamplona .
and guess what !
she' s got the next victim all lined up .
she' s turning another body on the spit .
okay , italics , here we go .
today is a day of profound introspection .
i have been accused of using this column ... to direct bitter diatribes at the opposite sex .
this uncomfortable accusation ... has plunged me into at least 15 minutes of serious reflection , from which i have emerged ... with the conclusion that , yes , i traffic in female stereotypes .
but how can one blame me when every time i step out my front door ,
i meet fresh proof that the female archetypes are alive and well .
the mother , the virgin , the whore , the crone .
they' re elbowing you in the subway , stealing your cabs , and overwhelming you with perfume in elevators .
but perhaps in fairness to the fairer sex ,
i do need to broaden my horizon and add some new goddesses to the pantheon .
i would like to nominate for deity the cheerleader , the coed ... and the man eater , the last of which concerns me most today .
in ancient greece , this fearsome female was known as erinys , the devouring death goddess .
in india , she is kali , who likes to devour her boyfriend shiva' s entrails ... " " while her yoni devours his dot , dot , dot ... never mind .
in indonesia , the bloody jawed man eater is called ragma .
you notice these are all countries without cable .
and in hale , maryland , where she helps run the family hardware store , she is known as miss maggie carpenter , a . k . a . the runaway bride .
what is unusual about miss carpenter ... is that she likes to dress her men up as grooms before she devours them .
one antique hot water handle with the " hot " still on it .
guaranteed to fit any american standard cast iron tub ... with a four inch center mount made between 1924 and 1938 .
in other words , mr. paxton ,
i think you are out of the doghouse with mrs. paxton .
hallelujah !
i' il see you later .
i' il put it on your charge .
there' s a possibility she hasn' t seen this yet .
maybe she just hasn' t picked up a paper .
know what i mean ?
or not .
maggie ?
earl , you don' t need an air conditioner .
you need an attic fan .
there' s more in the back .
hey .
what ?
so , mag , you' ve seen this , huh ?
yes , i' ve seen it .
and it is the rudest , most offensive ... joke anyone has ever played on me !
you guys , how long did this take you ?
where did you get it done ?
you' re both creeps , by the way .
i should " disinvite " you .
maggie , you told us no bachelorette jokes , so we didn' t

on the local front , our town of hale , maryland , is still buzzing about the less than flattering article ... about their native daughter , maggie carpenter .
her bridal exploits were taken to task ... by new york columnist ike graham in usa today .
mr. graham called her  [ radio off ]
greetings from the sticks .
perhaps you believe that a rural education is focused mainly ... on hog calling and tractor maintenance rather than reading .
why else would you print a piece of fiction about me and call it fact ?
why else would you print a piece of fiction about me and call it fact ?
i suppose mr. graham was too busy thinking up slanderous statements ... about how i dump men for kicks ... to bother with something silly like accuracy in reporting .
which is understandable , because with a man eater like me on the loose , who has time to check facts ?
hey , frances , lunch today ?
no , i' m going to the bank .
sure ?
sorry , ike .
all right .
hey .
hey .
i' m going to put in a good word for you .

that' s why i was surprised to find ...
mr. graham' s editor was a woman .
call me a sentimental fool , but i hoped we man eaters could stick together .

you must be proud of him .
i didn' t really know him back then .
he was actually dating maggie ... at the time .
i mean , he never really they were never gonna ... get engaged or anything , it was just like , you know .
sometimes he' d call her magpie , and it was really irritating .

no , this is good .
he' s stealing third !
yes !

good morning to you too .
you look good .
thank you .
do you think i flirt with cory ?
yes .
i don' t mean to .
i know .
i think sometimes you just sort of ... spaz out with excess flirtatious energy , and it just lands on anything male that moves .
anything male that moves ?
as opposed to anything male that doesn' t ?
well , like certain kinds of coral .
i' m definitely going to have to kill myself today .
why ?
because you think i' m all like , " hey , man , check me out .
no , i don' t .
i think you' re like ...
i' m charming and mysterious in a way that even i don' t understand , and something about me is crying out for protection from a big man like you .
it' s very hard to compete with .
especially as ... married women who' ve lost our mystery .
lost you have you are totally mysterious .
no .
i' m weird .
weird and mysterious are two very different things .
i' m weird .
no , you' re quirky .
quirky and weird are two very different things .
peggy , i think there is a distinct possibility ... that i am profoundly and irreversibly screwed up .
despite that ,
i love you and i promise ... to no longer flirt with cory .
maggie , i' m not worried about you and cory , or me and cory , or you being irreversibly screwed up .
maggie , you' ve been like this since we were kids .
and all i' m thinking is , now that you' re aware of it , and that it hurts people' s feelings sometimes , maybe it' s time to get on with life , and commit to someone of your own ,
like bob , if he' s the one .
i know .
is there anything i can do to ... make it up to you ?
well , there' s always ... the thing that brings warmth to my heart , and that is duckbill platypus .

at some point one or both of us is gonna want to get out of this thing .

yeah , really .
it' s something i' ve always wanted to  [ door closes ]
you could make breaking and entering into a new career .
so , what are you doing here anyway ?
i wanted to talk to you ... about why i run , sometimes ride , away from things .
does it matter ?
i think so .
when i was walking down the aisle , i was walking toward somebody ... who had no idea who i really was .
and it was only half the other person' s fault ... because i had done everything to convince him ... that i was exactly what he wanted .
so , it was good ... that i didn' t go through with it because it would' ve been a lie .
but you
you knew the real me .
yes , i did .
i didn' t .
still , i ended up chasing a truck .
i can' t , um , do anything about the truck .
but , uh
benedict .
arnold .
i love eggs benedict .
i hate all the other kinds of eggs .
i hate big weddings , everybody staring .
i' d like to get married on a weekday while everybody' s at work .
and if i ride off into the sunset , i want my own horse .
should i be writing this down ?
and there' s something else .
no , you can tell me .
don' t
okay .
these are for you .
used  well , they' re mine .
i' m turning in my running shoes to you .
this is serious .
and there' s one more thing .
i know , the mind reels that there could be more after this .
but , um , if you could just have a seat .
let' s just not have that there .
okay .
okay .
oh , no .
my , god , no .
no , no .
don' t hide your face .
this happens once in a lifetime , and it' s definitely a first for me .
you' re not gonna want to miss it , so pay close attention .
i love you , homer eisenhower graham .
will you marry me ?
will you marry me ?
i gotta think about this a little bit .

you were not !
not true .
if you' d said yes , i wouldn' t be able to do this next part ... and i' ve been practicing so let me
okay .
ready ?
i' m listening .
i guarantee that we' il have tough times .
and i guarantee that at some point ... one or both of us will want to get out .
but i also guarantee ... that if i don' t ask you to be mine ,
i' il regret it for the rest of my life .
' cause i know in my heart ... you' re the only one for me .
