it was sheer luck , really , that we found her at all .
the storm had blown it east .
you haven' t tried to board it , have you ?
we' re under orders to wait till you arrive .
i' m not one to question orders , dr. cirko , but it seems ridiculous not to board .
those men have got to be half starved .
i understand your concern , admiral .
this is a special case .
you' re damn right it' s a special case !
lose track of a nuclear sub for 46 hours and , boom , it shows up 5, 000 miles from where it went missing !

nav system' s fried .
silicone in the chips melted .

who are you people ?
scientists , like you .
you know , i know who you are .
alexander cirko , from berkeley .

they kicked you off the faculty because you ...
i found working in academia to be counterproductive .
ah , and who ys the bills now ?
a mix of private and ... public concerns .
if we could continue .
no , no more .
not until you tell me what you know , and then , like scientists , we collaborate .
that' s impossible , doctor .
why is that ?
because the institute' s research programs have been suspended indefinitely .
what ?
the facility' s now under the jurisdiction of the u. s. armed forces .
we' il need you to sign some things before you go .
i' m not signing anything .
i was the one that saw it .
alone , at 5, 000 feet !
i was the one that saw it in a disabled submersible .
a new vertebrate !
if i could have a word alone , please .
i empathize with your position .
i recognize that you had a profound experience .
you have kids , doctor ?
no .
i had one at 21 .
you put yourself through school ?
i won a series of fellowships .
i worked my way through .
and wanna know how ?
i waited tables four nights a week to pay for tuition and daycare .
we are not on the same planet .
so don' t try to empathize with me .
i worked my ass off to get here .
and i deserve to be a part of this .
endangered species ... don' t deserve to be on the brink of extinction .
but they are .
you are a marine biologist .
you of all people must know that life ... isn' t fair .
call kayla .
she' s a gas .

elrod .

i didn' t teach him to do that .
dad , this is ...
you' re not ...
you' re not listening .
this is not some sort of a setback .
okay ?
this is ...
i don' t even know .
or if i can get back into the institute .
they' ve completely confiscated all of my research , dad .
that means all .
all of the dive tapes and everything .
mom , i' m bored .
sweetie , i' m talking to grandpa .
can you just go inside and watch tv or something ?
dad , listen ,
i' m not being unreasonable , but you have to understand that ...
teach men to adapt themselves to some new world of the future .
leonard first saw the carcass while walking his dog on a pre dawn stroll friday morning .
and since then ,
local and state health officials are wondering what to do ...
mom !
mom !
mom !
what ? !
jesse , what , what ?
there it was , just lolling in the water .
it gave me quite a shock .
frankly , a whale carcass is a public health hazard .
something of this size could contaminate the water table , kick start a red tide .
we' ve taken precautionary measures .
cordoned off the beach until the carcass can be dealt with .
shut down us 17 , cut down on the looky loos .
we' ve got to look out for the interests of the public at large , you know ?
authorities claim that the decomposed carcass is a sperm whale that died at sea and drifted to ...
dad , i' m gonna call you back .
however , some locals are less sure .
so , what do you think it is ?
well , isn' t that obvious ?
it' s moby dick .
whatever it is , whew !
it stinks .
in sullivan' s island , south carolina , i' m marilyn prickett .
you believe me , right ?
i' m ...
of course i do .
i just ...
i' m trying to understand .
well , honey , i' m trying to understand too , you know ?
shh , you' re gonna wake up the kids .
oh , screw waking up the kids , baby .
something happened to me .
i know you believe that .
don' t treat me like i' m crazy .
no , no , i didn' t say you were crazy .
i ...
honey , you were knocked .
no !
i was clear as a bell !
you were unconscious when bug found you .
hon , i don' t think you were in your right mind when ...
what ?
when what ?
when george drowned .
george did not drown !
something happened ... and you were knocked ... and he drowned .
no .
that' s it .
that' s all that happened .
it was an accident .
look , you know ...
i don' t know how else to put this .
i' m just asking you to believe me .
i am trying .
i ...
i just don' t understand why you' re driving to south carolina .
so i can convince myself ... that it wasn' t my fault .
okay .
charleston , south carolina , that' s right .
as early as possible .
all right , let me check the computer for you , ma' am .
um , do you have anything tonight ?
um , let me see here .
we do have one .
it' s a connecting flight for one passenger .
is that all right ?
um , you better make that two tickets .
all right .
ladies and gentlemen , there is some evidence that this is simply a natural phenomenon .
this was recovered near the sighting in south carolina .
the tooth has no known antecedent in the fossil record .
it is as if it just fell from the sky .
