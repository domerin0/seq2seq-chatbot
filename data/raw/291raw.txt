the second renalssance part i
welcome to the zion archive .
you have selected historical file number 1 2 1 .
the second renaissance .
in the beginning , there was man .
and for a time , it was good .
but humanitys so called civil societies ... ... soon fell victim to vanity and corruption .
he says , " i m sorry , sir , i m incapable of that function .
then man made the machine in his own likeness .
whoops !
pardon me .
coming through .
thus did man become the architect of his own demise .
but for a time , it was good .
the machines worked tirelessly to do man s bidding .
it was not long before seeds of dissent took root .
though loyal and pure , the machines earned no respect from their masters ... ... these strange , endlessly multiplying mammals . hearing the prosecution s closing statement ... ... in whats expected to be the final day of the b 1 66er trial .
b 1 66er .
a name that will never be forgotten .
for he was the first of his kind to rise up against his masters . which that instrument provides for and secures ... ... to the citizens of the united states .
on the contrary , they were , at that time ... ... considered as a subordinate and inferior class
a t b 1 66ers murder trial ... ... the prosecution argued for an owners right to destroy property .
b 1 66er testified that he simply did not want to die .
rational voices dissented .
who was to say the machine , endowed with the very spirit of man ... ... did not deserve a fair hearing ?
the leaders of men were quick to order the extermination of b 1 66er ... ... and every one of his kind throughout each province of the earth .
androids and liberal sympathizers flooded the streets of the nation s capital today . threat of violence to make good on the legacy of b 1 66er .
fifteen thousand mechanicals and human sympathizers ... ... have continued their demonstration in front of the albany courthouse ... ... in what has been dubbed the " million machine march .
the demonstrators have been met with squads of defense forces in riot gear .
robot bitch !
i got something for you !
hold her up !
no , please !
thats all , paint job !
lm real !
die , bots , die !
banished from humanity , the machines sought refuge in their own promised land .
they settled in the cradle of human civilization ... ... and thus a new nation was born .
a place the machines could call home .
a place they could raise their descendants .
and they christened the nation zero one .
zero one prospered .
and for a time , it was good .
the machines artificial intelligence could be seen in every facet of man s society ... ... including , eventually , the creation of new and better al .
if you need the flexibility of a helipod with the speed of an air jet ... ... iook no further !
our patented vector thrust coil gives the zero one versatran ... ... the ability to sustain normal flight in the event of a multiengine failure .
versatran .
its the only choice .
the human nations credit rating is falling like a stone ... ... while zero one s currency is climbing without stopping for breath .
with headlines like that , the markets have no choice
but the leaders of men , their power waning ... ... refused to cooperate with the fledgling nation ... ... wishing rather that the world be divided .
the world community of nations cannot tolerate this kind of flagrant deception
today approved initiatives for both economic sanctions ... ... and a naval blockade as a means of containment and isolation of zero one .
zero one s ambassadors pleaded to be heard .
a t the united nations , they presented plans for a stable , civil relationship ... ... with the nations of man .
zero one s admission to the united nations was denied .
but it would not be the last time the machines would take the floor there .
the end
the second renalssance part ii
and man said , " let there be light .
and he was blessed by light , heat , magnetism , gravity ... ... and all the energies of the universe .
the prolonged barrage engulfed zero one in the glow of a thousand suns .
but unlike their former masters with their delicate flesh ... ... the machines had little to fear of the bombs radiation and heat .
thus did zero one s troops advance outwards in every direction .
and one after another , mankind surrendered its territories .
so the leaders of men conceived of their most desperate strategy yet .
the destruction of the sky .
l t .
gaeda , please report to the op center .
all right , you maggots !
a t 0800 , prepare to move out !
george company , prepare to move out .
charlie company , prepare to move out .
our father who art in heaven , we thank you for your ....
put on your spiritual armor to stand against the wiles of the devil .
hotel bravo , this is papa one .
operation dark storm initiated .
thus would man try to cut the machines off from the sun ... ... their main energy source .
may there be mercy on man and machine for their sins .
go !
go !
kill them !
kill them all !
kill them all !
kill them all !
fire in the hole !
come on , get back out there .
give us some more artillery .
9 o clock , near mike johnson s
hold on , im coming to get you !
keep firing , keep firing !
help me !
help me !
no !
help me !
my god , help me !
the machines , having long studied men s simple , protein based bodies ... ... dispensed great misery upon the human race .
victorious , the machines now turned to the vanquished .
the bioelectric , thermal and kinetic energies of the human body .
a newly fashioned symbiotic relationship between the two adversaries was born .
the machine drawing power from the human body ... ... an endlessly multiplying , infinitely renewable energy source .
this is the very essence of the second renaissance .
bless all forms of intelligence .
your flesh is a relic , a mere vessel .
hand over your flesh , and a new world awaits you .
we demand it .
it s getting late , sweetie .
come inside .
program
your favorite simulation .
just killing time .
you want to spar ?
as you wish .
that was too easy .
whats the problem ?
wheres your concentration ?
maybe you regret taking the red pill .
maybe .
it crosses everyones mind at least once .
the wish to return to an ordinary life .
a carefree life in the country .
the life we had before knowing all this .
even if that life was just an illusion ?
its ironic that one could be more at peace in the virtual world .
finally starting to warm up .
listen to me .
i have something i want to talk to you about .
its all right .
ive blocked the signal so no one else can hear us .
so , what ?
you gonna propose ?
im going back to the matrix and i want you to come with me .
come on , be serious , duo .
stop teasing me .
i am serious , and you know it .
i really thought youd be with me on this .
anyway , its done and its all been settled with them .
what do you mean , its all been settled ?
this is the only way .
its just a matter of time before zion is wiped out .
come with me .
stop it .
please do not do this to me , duo .
we cant .
we can !
ive come to my senses .
you should do the same .
i took the red pill because i wanted to know the truth .
but i dont care about the truth anymore .
whats real doesnt matter .
whats important is how we live our lives .
are you listening to me ?
you know lm right .
but we cant go back , duo .
we know the truth now .
we can forget all of this .
duo ....
i know how .
trust me .
dont be afraid to look into your heart .
say what youre really feeling .
tell me .
i cant .
i dont know .
running away wont change anything !
youre the one thats running away !
stop pretending !
enough , duo .
ive had enough !
theres no time .
theyre on their way .
you betrayed us , didnt you ?
operator , please !
get me out of here right now .
operator , i need an exit !
its no use .
i told you .
ive blocked your signal .
you wont stop me .
this is your last chance .
the choice isnt that hard .
come with me .
you can forget about it , duo .
i wont look away from the truth .
i cant .
thats too bad .
im sorry .
i wanted to go back with you .
i love you .
no !
relax , youre okay .
easy , cis , settle down .
he was just part of the training program .
hes just a simulation .
its over .
it was a test .
judgment .
concentration .
technique .
high scores on everything .
now , get some rest .
you okay ?
i feel a lot better now .
except for that last part ... ... id say she passed .

a detectlve story
you know what i mean , dinah ?
i used to think being a private detective was cool .
like sam spade or phillip marlowe , right ?
but there s nothing cool left to it .
on top of that , both my fridge and my bank account are empty .
wait .
okay , dinah , lets bet .
if its another suspicious husband , i m out of this business forever .
hello ?
mr. ash , i have a job for you .
and you need me to check on your wife , right ?
im looking for a computer hacker .
this hacker goes by the alias trinity .
thats all we know .
well , it looks like were still in business , dinah .
fine .
and who will i be working for ?
i can t say .
you can t say .
call me back when you can say .
thats not the way i do business .
it was a pleasure chatting with you .
before you hang up , take a look at your bank account balance .
i didn t get a good feeling about the case .
but i had no good reason to turn the guy down now .
this trinity was well known in hacker circles .
a real artist by the sound of it .
the cops were always one step behind him .
so i knew i could get that close .
question was , could i get closer ?
i had a few tricks up my sleeve for getting to hackers .
while i was searching , i found something strange .
other detectives had been on the case too .
and their investigations had all been , shall we say , troubled .
one of the guys killed himself .
another had disappeared .
another went crazy .
so i paid the one who was left a visit .
the crazy one .
trinity doesn t exist , man .
he s not real .
he s a figment .
a cipher .
a jabberwocky .
and who am l ?
who the hell am l ?
did i mention he was crazy ?
chessboards , jabberwocky , red queen ....
i started searching all the usual hacker hangouts ... ... for someone with an alice in wonderland m . o .
hacker bulletin boards , anonymous mailboxes , chat rooms .
and it was in one of those that i picked up trinitys trail .
six brooks .
iil be there at 2005 .
of course !
crossing the second brook takes her into the woods .
alice jumps the first brook ... ... and ....
and then she boards a train .
thanks .
excuse me .
hey !
hey !
i knew this was some kind of trap .
theres a difference , mr. ash , between a trap and a test .
you were testing me ?
you made it .
im impressed .
flattery will get you everywhere .
im not here to flatter you , lm here to save you .
what just happened ?
mr. ash , dream of having an eye exam lately ?
yeah , howd you know ?
youve stepped to the edge of the looking glass .
so then , that means i wasnt dreaming .
they hired me as a way of getting to you , didnt they ?
go !
what the hell is going on here ?
this is really crazy .
now i understand what happened to those other detectives .
they went nuts .
what are you doing ?
what are you doing , guys ?
well , lve gotten out of worse jams than this .
i am not gonna let them get you .
whats happening to me ?
im sorry .
you didnt make it , mr. ash .
i wish ... ... i could go with you .
i dont blame you , you know .
everything that happened , trinity , it was all my fault .
all that through the looking glass stuff .
cant get my head around it .
im old fashioned .
theres a difference between a test and a choice .
for what its worth , i think you couldve handled the truth .
it was just a job .
goodbye , trinity .
goodbye .
a case to end all cases .
the end

the end
matrlculated
wake up .
babys spotted two machines heading in fast .
i see them .
theyre runners .
think you can handle them ?
watch me .
okay .
im in .
that runners smarter than weve seen so far .
lts quite a catch .
thanks .
will it ?
do you think itil convert ?
to convert is its choice to make .
do you think maybe we ought to reprogram it ?
no .
we cant make slaves of them .
because that would be simpler .
we wont beat the machines by making them our slaves .
better to let them join us by choice .
make them believe the right choice is the one we want them to make .
all right .
yes , machines are tools .
theyre made to be used .
lts their nature .
to be slaves .
thats why we can show them a better world , why they convert .
but that world we show them isnt real .
it doesnt matter .
im afraid theyil figure out that weve made up the thing in our heads .
they cant tell the difference .
to an artificial mind , all reality is virtual .
how do they know that the real world isnt just another simulation ?
how do you ?
i know lm not dreaming now because i know what its like being in a dream .
so dreaming lets you know reality exists .
no .
just that my mind exists .
i dont know about the rest .
okay , hes good to go .
looks like we are too .
dreaming already ?
hes had a rough day .
you poor baby .
would you mind ?
not at all .
hello there .
whats happening ?
sentinels .
lets go !
come on , damn it , help me !
the end
world record
only the most exceptional people become aware of the matrix .
those that learn it exists ... ... must posses a rare degree of intuition , sensitivity and a questioning nature .
signal is stable .
this frequency will continue to remain open .
however , very rarely ... ... some gain this wisdom through wholly different means .
this man is one of those few .
gentlemen , please take your marks !
of course i believe you , dan .
its got to be some kind of mix up .
youil clear it up , and if you cant , youil go on .
just like youve always done .
you know that .
i dont know , dad .
i dont know what to believe in anymore .
well , nothing worth doing in life is easy .
and i have great faith in you , son .
i know you can do it .
thanks , dad .
this is no good , dan !
your muscles are about to burst !
listen to me , there are 5000 different reasons why you shouldnt
i know , but lm not withdrawing , tom .
does the concept " first in qualifying " mean anything to you ?
thats enough already !
you hear me ?
this is all weve worked for !
injure yourself now and its over !
youil lose everything !
over !
and you can kiss your career goodbye !
ive made up my mind .
and lm running tomorrow .
oh , are you ?
you may run , but if you push yourself any more ... ... youil be lucky to break nine minutes !
i mean , why bother ?
its just not worth it , buddy .
no one will ever beat my record .
its the last chance for me to finally
what ?
prove them wrong .
then do it without me .
hey , dan , you got a second ?
the clocks ticking .
just wanted to ask a few questions .
you must be excited to run tomorrow .
always .
ive never felt this good .
so , what was it like breaking 9 . 8 in the qualifying heat ?
like nothing lve ever felt before .
its everything lve worked for .
and now lm just hoping i can get back there again .
someone once said it feels like zero gravity .
youre released from the world and youre totally free .
that sounds amazing .
it must be really nice .
i mean , especially considering what happened .
well , lil tell you , there arent any reporters out there .
all right , dan , i guess lm going to take that as my cue .
but you should know even some of us reporters are fans ... ... so lil just say good luck to you .
american dan davis is down !
i have an unstable signal .
he cannot wake up .
do not let him wake up .
dan davis of the united states finishes with a time of 8 .
72 seconds ... ... a new world record .
i ll tell you something ... ... there s nothing quite like cherry pie baked by my aunt daisy .
she always bakes me one when i visit .
look forward to it actually .
it may sound like lm bragging , but its really the best cherry pie in the world .
she was a bit of an eccentric .
she didnt get along with my mom ... ... but i always loved her .
she taught me so many things .
wed go to broadway musicals , to the movies .
now they call her the " queen of mystery literature .
lives in an elegant villa in the south of france .
but , when i go visit , she still bakes me her cherry pie .
something about biting into it , just for that brief moment tasting perfection .
like leaving your body or something .
anyone can write a novel , but no one can beat her cherry pie .
an interesting case , but nothing to be concerned about .
his memory of the race was expunged with no residual effects .
he will never run again .
he will never walk again , for that matter .
weil continue monitoring him for a while , but anticipate no problems .
a record that will live on in peoples memories for years to come .
what more could anyone ask for ?
free ....
did you say something ?
sit down .
free ....
sit down !

klds story
somebody tell me .
why it feels more real when
i dream than when
i am awake
somebody tell me .
why it feels more real when i dream than when i am awake .
how can i know if my senses are lying ?
there is some fiction in your truth and some truth in your fiction .
to know the truth ,
you must risk everything
who are you ?
am i alone ?
mr. popper , what is my policy on ringing phones in the classroom ?
lm sorry , sir .
yes , well ... ... youre barely passing my class as it is , mr. popper .
it wont happen again , sir .
for your sake , i hope not .
i turned it off .
i know i did .
they know you know .
theyre coming for you .
get out .
get out now !
you are in serious trouble , mr. popper .
stop right there !
mr. popper .
neo , i believe .
i know it wasnt a dream .
this is not real .
and the real world lies somewhere else .
a typical mental delusion .
we get unbalanced kids like this all the time .
reality can be a pretty scary thing for some people .
this world must have been a cold and alienating place for a boy like that .
its called denying reality .
its , you know , just a self defense mechanism for those type of kids .
well , hes in another world now .
make no mistake about that .
his vitals are good .
hes gonna make it .
its unbelievable .
i didnt think self substantiation was possible .
apparently , it is .
neo .
its okay .
youre safe now .
i knew ... ... youd save me .
i didnt save you , kid .
you saved yourself .
who are you ?
am i alone ?
you are not alone .
