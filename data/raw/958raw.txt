poor baby .
let' s just roll with this one .
oh , mike and i had|such a connection .
the first time that we had sex , ... it was so beautiful ...
i cried .
you cried ?
yeah .
you mean , like, |one glistening tear on your cheek , right ?
no .
i was really emotional .
i even told him|that i loved him .
after how many days ?
five .
two .
it was how i felt . |l wanted to express myself .
okay , well , what did he say ?
oh , mike didn' t have|to say an" yt" hing .
i know that he felt the same .
but then he started|getting really busy , and i didn' t know where he was .
so i kept calling him|and calling him .
he was never home ...
you kept calling him ?
i didn' t leave a message .
he didn' t know it was me . |my number' s blocked .
oh , l i' m sure he thought|it was one of his friends .
you know , men frequently call their friends' |answering machines and hang up 20 times .
an" yw" ay ...
i' m too fat .
you' re not fat ! | you' re not fat !
oh , michelle , if the most|beautiful woman in the world acted the way you did , any normal guy|would still go running in the other direction .
oh , no .
no guy would go|running from you , andie .
you could barf all over him, |and he would say , " do it again .
that is both|incredibly disgusting and categorically untrue .
lf i did the things you did, |l' d get dumped , too .
okay , family , shoes off .
and breathe .
out .
okay , lori, |let' s start with you .
well , the " botox for beginners" |piece is done .
now , it' s a little scary, |but mostly upbeat .
now i' m on
what your gyno won' t tell you , " which is also pretty scary , but , you know , upbeat .
i finished my research|on deadly pedicures , about the woman who contracted that fungus|from the unsterilized tools .
yeah .
it' s a terrible story .
although , surprisingly ... upbeat !
marvelous .
what' s next for| " ' how to ' with andie " ?
well , i' ve been|working on something that' s kind of different .
it' s ...
it' s a political piece, |and it' s ...

andie , you work at|" com" p" osure magazine .
we are fashion , trends , diets, |cosmetic surgeries , salacious gossip |that' s " com" p" osure .

michelle , what have you got ?
i' m sorry , lana ,
i wasn' t feeling very well ...
she got dumped .
oh , no ,

we love the way she looks . | oh , you are so right .
she looks great .
well , i haven' t eaten|since the split .
good for you !
write about it .
i can' t use my personal life|for a story .
i understand completely .
who will use michelle' s|personal life for a story ?
oh , i will .
go . | no , no , no ,
lana , with all due respect ,
lori has no business|mucking around in my personal life, |and i can' t ...
i can' t let her .
i am ... | i' il do it .

i' il ...
i will ... |l' il sort of do it .
it' s ...
you will be my inspiration .
for ?
look at michelle .
she is a great girl , right ? | yes .
an amazing woman .
but she has a problem|hanging onto relationships , and doesn' t really know what she' s doing wrong , which is like a lot|of our readers .
uh huh .
so , i was thinking that|l could start by dating a guy , and then drive him away , but only using|the classic mistakes most women , like michelle , make ... all the time .
i' il keep a diary of it , and it will be sort of a ... |dating " how to " in reverse .
what not to do .
yeah .
how to lose a guy in ten days .
yes .
go .
bart , what' s new|in the shoe world ?
wait , wait , lana , i' m sorry .
why ten days ?
five days is too short, |and we go to press in 1 1 .
yes ?
okay , what we found out is men are attracted|to purple shoes .
now , i love ...
maybe toss in something|spiritual as well .
who' s that chic buddhist|richard gere cavorts with ?

what are you working on now ?
oh , actually ...
how to lose a guy in ten days .
she' s actually going|to start dating a guy , and then drive him away|in a week and a half .
sounds needlessly vicious .
it' s going to be fabulous .
now all she has to do|is run along and find the luc" ky " guy . |go , go , go .
nice to meet you . | bye .
good bye .
ladies , come .
find the guy .

i' m going to have this guy|running for his life .
you' re not going to burn|his apartment down or bite him or an" yt" hing, |are you ?

i' m going to limit myself to doing everything girls|do wrong in relationships .
basically , everything|we know guys hate .
i' il be clingy , needy ...
yeah . | be touchy feely .
ooh , call him in the middle|of the night , and tell him everything|you had to eat that day .
what' s wrong with that ?
i' m kidding .
hello , ben .
what are you doing here ?
phil , i' m here for|the meeting .
ladies .
but you weren' t invited .
yeah , but i should have been .
i mean , it was my tip that delauer' s shopping|for a new firm .
yes , it was , but i have|to think in terms of who' s best suited|within the company team .
yes , sir , and that' s me . |l want to handle this pitch .
ben , you sell joe blow better|than anyone else in my shop , but these girls sell luxury better than anyone else|in the business .
we have to put our best foot|forward on this pitch .
delauer would be|our biggest account .
yes , sir , they would .
annual advertising billings|of 50 to $60 million .
and i am the man that' s going to bring this home|for you , phil .
why this place ?
it' s perfect .
hi , lngrid .
hi .
mullins ' is the apres work|watering hole for the upwardly mobile .
now , to date , the diamond industry|has always targeted men , sending the message|that the woman needs the man to buy her the rock .
all right , they say, |" a diamond is forever .
we say, |" a diamond is for everyone .
i like that . |yes .
we don' t .
a diamond is for everyone " sends the message|that diamonds are everywhere , which means they' re not rare, |and if they' re not rare , they lose their status .
status is the reason to buy them in the first place , which benjamin would know|if he understood women , which you don' t .
you can' t feel bad about that, |ben .
no man does .
here you go .
thank you .
thanks .
oh !
sorry .
here .
here .
thanks .
dum , dum , dum , dum, |dum , dum , dum ...
hey , don' t pressure her . |she' s perusing .
yes , exactly .
hmm .
hmm .
selling a diamond to a woman is like making her fall in love .
she has to feel giddy, |desirous , adventurous , and desperate .
take a look around|this room , phillip .
most of the women in this bar|are looking for just that .
exactly .
the skills required|to market diamonds are the same as those needed to|make a woman fall in love , yes .
i' m not talking about lust .
a woman in lust wants chocolate .
a woman in love ... |wants diamonds .
yeah , i' m not talking about lust , either , ladies .

i respect women , all right ?
and i also listen ... to women , and that' s why i can sell myself|to any woman , an" yw" here , an" yt" ime .
make a woman fall in love|with diamonds , benjamin ... or with you ?
eh , either one .
well , that' s coc" ky " , ben .
no , not coc" ky " confident .
i' d like to see you prove that .
you would ?
the agency' s cohosting a party for the delauers|at the astor museum .
the party' s a week from sunday .
do you think you could make a woman fall in love with you|by then ?
ten days ?
any woman , an" yw" here , an" yt" ime ?
any single , available, |straight woman yes .
yes .
i' m not trying|to trick you , ben .
ln fact , we' il choose|a woman right here , right now , in this bar , and then you decide .
ooh .
so , who' s the luc" ky " girl ?
okay ...
let' s see here .
ooh , there' s that blonde babe|in the leopard print .
whoa , ho , ho !
she looks like fun .

hanging with her for ten days|is going to be no problem .
right , so , it' s only|nine days longer than you' ve ever spent|with any other chick , huh ?
that' s why i didn' t go|for the gold immediately .
oh .
i' m taking my time .
it' s a marathon , not a sprint .
ten days is a marathon ?
okay , so it' s more like|the 3, 000 meter hurdle .
the point is , she' s already|on the ropes , guys .
wow , that that' s a lot|of sports analogies .
that it ?
that that' s it ? | that' s it .
have you looked inside ?
no .
do you have an ethical problem with rifling through|a woman' s purse ?
uh , yeah , i guess i do .
well , it' s hardly a purse , dude .
it' s more like a clutch|or something .
guys , a woman' s purse, |all right it' s her secret source of power . |all right ?
there there are many dark|and dangerous things in there that we , the male species, |should know nothing about .
oh .
unless , of course , she , uh, |left it behind intentionally to secure a next day call back .
mm hmm .
she' s a very clever minx .

the guy' s in advertising .

i' m going to the game with somebody else .
not anymore .
besides , what ?
you think you left your purse|at my place by accident ?
