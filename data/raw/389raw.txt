i don' t like it up here .
are you scared of heights ?
i don' t know .
after what happened to johnny gobs
look , johnny gobs got ripped and took a walk off a roof .
no big loss .
that ain' t what i heard at all .
i heard that the bat got him .
the bat ?
give me a break , will you ?
five stories .
straight down .
there wasn' t no blood in the body .
no shit .
it was all over the pavement .
i' m getting out of here .
shut up .
listen to me .
there ain' t no bat .
you shouldn' t have turned the gun on that kid .
you want your cut of this money or not ?
now shut up !
shut up !
don' t kill me !
don' t kill me !
don' t kill me !
don' t kill me !
i won' t kill you .
i want you to do me a favor .
tell all your friends about me .
what are you ?
i' m batman .
across this nation ... ... the words " gotham city " are synonymous with crime .
our streets are overrun , our public officials are helpless .
as mayor , i promise to root out the source of this corruption ... ... boss carl grissom .
now , our new district attorney , harvey dent ... ... will carry out that promise .
thank you , mayor borg .
thank you .
people of gotham city ... ... i' m a man of few words .
but those words will count , and so will my actions .
commissioner gordon informs me ... ... that he has targeted those businesses ... ... suspected of fronting for the syndicate in this city .
before this week is out ... ... we are going to knock down their doors ... ... and shed the light of the law on that nest of vipers .
together , we can make this city safe for decent people .
decent people shouldn' t live here .
they' d be happier someplace else .
pretty tough talk about carl .
forget about it .
if this clown could touch grissom , i' d have handed him his lungs by now .
if grissom knew about us ... ... he might hand you something .
don' t flatter yourself , angel .
he' s a tired old man .
he can' t run this city without me .
and besides ... ... he doesn' t know .
you don' t worry about anything , do you , jack ?
you look fine .
i didn' t ask .
yeah .
hanging on .
let me guess .
giant , menacing , supernatural form .
kind of like a bat .
that' s it .
what are they seeing up there ?
they' re drinking drano .
it' s weird .
thanks for the tip .
christ .
knox .
lieutenant , i hear we had another bat attack .
that' s eight sightings in a month .
i hear the commissioner' s opened a file .
sorry , knox .
these two slipped on a banana peel .
i' m telling you , a giant bat !
don' t write about this .
it will ruin your already useless reputation .
lieutenant , every punk in this town is scared .
they say he can' t be killed .
they say he drinks blood .
i say you' re full of shit , knox .
you can quote me on that .
is there a six foot bat in gotham city ?
is he on the police payroll ?
what' s he pulling down , after taxes ?
brought you a little snack , eckhardt .
why don' t you broadcast it ?
shut up and listen .
harvey dent has been sniffing around one of our front companies .
that' s my territory .
if there' s a problem , i deal with it .
your problems are our problems .
i answer to grissom , not to psychos .
you ought to think about the future .
you mean when you run the show ?
you got no future , jack .
you' re an a 1 nut boy , and grissom knows it .
better be sure .
see ?
you can make a good decision when you try .
where' ve you been spending your nights ?
i don' t care if this festival is in debt , i want a parade .
i want hot dogs , balloons , everything .
we' il celebrate this 200th anniversary proudly and publicly .
we may celebrate in bankruptcy court .
it' s $250, 000 in debt and we haven' t seen one balloon .
you fill the square with people , and businesses will come back .
a lot of people may stay away .
they' re scared .
they won' t be scared when you get grissom in the courthouse .
i promised that , remember ?
welcome , count dracula .
had any sightings of big foot lately ?
they buried your story on batman .
they bury garbage .
this is pulitzer prize stuff .
i got something for you .
very funny .
you should have put more gore under the fangs .
what a dick .
hello , legs .
i' m reading your stuff .
well , i' m reading yours .
hi , i' m vicki vale .
yeah , photographer .
vogue , cosmo .
yeah .
if you want me to pose nude , you' il need a long lens .
actually , i was in the corto maltese .
you could get hurt doing this stuff .
what brings you here ?
i' m here to see the wildlife in gotham city .
wildlife ?
mm hmm .

like ... bats .
who sent you ?
nobody , really .
i just loved your story , and ... ... l like bats .

i need something tangible .
gordon' s got a file .

he' il be at bruce wayne' s benefit , right ?
yeah .
i don' t seem to be on the guest list .
no .
yes , yes .
vale , will you marry me ?
no .
buy me lunch ?
maybe .
i eat light .
say this ... ... son of a bitch ... ... makes a connection with us and with axis chemicals .
what kind of damage are we looking at ?
if he ties us with axis chemicals , we' re dead and buried .
we should move immediately .
i say we break into the place ... ... trash the office ... ... and make off with the records and say it was industrial espionage .
jack ....
smart thinking .
that' s the way to go .
in fact ... ... i' d like you to handle this operation personally .
me ?
hello , sweetheart .
would you mind waiting in the next room ?
that' s all , gentlemen .
thank you .
that' s all .
carl ....
can somebody else do this ?
the fumes in that place ....
jack ....
it' s an important job .
i need ... ... someone i can trust .
you ... are my number one guy .
now ... ... don' t forget ... ... your lucky deck .
my friend ... ... your luck is about to change .
police department .

can i help you , sir ?
oh , thanks .
thank you very much .
that' s very nice of you .

i' m not sure .
thanks anyway .

i can make that eight .
i can make that eight .
commissioner !
mrs. gordon , you look lovely .
is it true the commissioner has a file on the batman ?
there is no bat .
if there were , we would find and arrest him .
be straight with me , commissioner .
how' re you making out ?
mr. dent , i love that tie .
we were discussing winged vigilantes .
what' s your stand ?
we have enough problems in this city ... ... without worrying about ghosts .
pardon me , but that' s not a denial .
excuse me , i' il be back .
won' t anybody go on record ?
your honor , great suit .
no comment .
robert , what' s up ?
anonymous tip .
napier' s cleaning out axis chemicals .
why wasn' t i told ?
who' s in charge ?
eckhardt .
oh , my god !
come on , let' s go .
mr. gordon ?
mr. gordon ?
wait , wait .
living room , dining room , arsenal .
look at this stuff .
who is this guy ?
he gives to humanitarian causes , and then collects all this stuff .
he probably does it to get chicks .
they like his charity balls .
don' t leave out his very large bankroll .
the more they' ve got , the less they' re worth .
this guy must be the most worthless guy in america .
check this out .
he must have been the king of the wicker people .
where' d this come from ?
i have no idea .
it' s japanese .
how do you know ?
i bought it in japan .
who are you ?
sorry .
bruce wayne .
alexander knox .
i read your work .
i like it a lot .
thanks .
can i have a grant ?
vicki vale .
hi .
bruce wayne .

yeah .
i' ve seen your pictures from corto maltese , haven' t l ?
you' ve got a wonderful eye .
some people think she has two .
this is an amazing house .
i' d like to shoot it sometime .
mr. wayne , we need more champagne .
is that all right ?
sure .
go ahead .
how many cases ?
six ?
six ?
six is good .
six .
thanks .
will you be in gotham for a while ?
i' d love to .
i' m intrigued by alex' s " giant bat " stories .
oh , right .
the bat ....
batman .
a bit light after the war in corto maltese , no ?
what do you do for a living ?
commissioner gordon was compelled to leave .
very unexpectedly , sir .
will you two excuse me ?
i think perhaps this way , sir .
they need wine in the front room , and a mrs. daley needs a copy of the menu .
and give knox a grant .
nice talking with you , wayne .
the rich ....
know why they' re so odd ?
they can afford to be .
look at this mirror .
maybe it should be bruce vain .
what' s up ?
anonymous tip .
napier' s cleaning out axis chemicals .
gordon : if we could get him , we' d have grissom .
why wasn' t i told ?
who' s in charge ?
eckhardt .
oh , my god !
come on , let' s go .
take a good look .
this is the guy .
get a good look .
shoot to kill .
you know what i mean ?
let' s move out .
we' ve been ratted out , boys .
watch it .
freeze !
you take the right .
move it .
what the hell' s going on ?
what are you trying to do ?
i' m in charge , not carl grissom .
this is commissioner gordon . i want him taken alive . i repeat .
any man who opens fire on jack napier will answer to me .
let me down !
let me down !
let me down !
oh , my god !
get up on the catwalk , on that side .
you take that side .
be very careful .
jesus !
let him go ... or i' il do gordon .
nice outfit .
come on , jack , let' s go !
come on !
eckhardt !
think about the future .
goddamn it , we had him !
hold it right there !
who is this guy ?
i don' t know .
until we find out , keep a lid on it .
if there' s no bat , then who dropped napier into the acid ?
suicide ?
i want to get this on tape .
hello ?
he hung up .
what have you got ?
here' s the inner city .
here' s the sightings so far .
maybe batman has some sort of flight pattern .
this is very good .
tonight we' il go to dinner , then we' il walk the trail .
no can do .
i got a date .
bruce wayne .
wayne !
wayne !
oh , no !
the guy' s a stiff .
you could do much better .
thanks for being so concerned .
bye .
how' s the soup ?
excuse me ?
the soup .
how is it ?
it' s great .
could you pass the salt ?
sure .
did you have trouble finding the house ?
no ....
it was no problem .
good .
do you like eating in here ?
oh , yeah .
i don' t think i' ve been in this room before .
you want to leave ?
yes .
there was young master bruce ... ... leading his gray pony with me on its back ... ... like a sack of old potatoes , covered in mud and nursing a sprained ankle .
that was the first and last time i gave him a riding lesson .
i think i' ve embarrassed him for long enough .
i' m off to bed .
please , leave everything .
i' il tidy up in the morning .
good night , miss .
good night , alfred .
good night , sir .
good night , alfred .
he' s really wonderful .
he loves you a lot .
alfred' s great .
i couldn' t find my socks without him .
he reminds me of my grandfather .
were you close to him ?
i used to spend summers with him and my grandmother .
they had a house on the lake .
nothing like this , but ... ... it was fun .
that sounds nice .
yeah .
what about your family ?
actually , alfred is my family .
this house and all this stuff doesn' t seem like you at all .
some of it is very much me .
some isn' t .
that dining room is definitely not you .
the dining room isn' t .
let' s see how we did .
oh , my god !
mirror .
mirror !
you understand that the nerves were completely severed , mr. napier .
you see what i have to work with here .
there are an awful lot of stairs in this place .
my feet are killing me .
i feel a little drunk .
and you' re not anything .
one drink and i' m flying .
why are you afraid of flying ?
that you , sugar bumps ?
who are you ?
it' s me .
sugar bumps .
you' re alive !
i heard you' d been
fried ?
is that what you heard ?
you set me up over a woman .
a woman !
you must be insane .
don' t bother .
your life won' t be worth spit !
i' ve been dead once already .
it' s very liberating ... ... if you think of it as ... therapy .
jack , listen .
maybe we can cut a deal .
jack ?
jack is dead , my friend .
you can call me ... ... joker .
as you can see ... ... i' m a lot happier .
oh , what a day .
gotham city .
it always brings a smile to my face .
winged freak ... " ... terrorizes ....
wait' il they get a load of me .
oooh ....
i' ve got an idea .
how about lunch at my place ?
i' il show you some photos .

okay .
wait a minute .
no , i can' t .
i can' t make it .
okay , we' il do it later in the day .
i can' t make it then , either .
i' ve got a very important meeting today .
what' s wrong ?
nothing .
i have to leave town for a few days .
okay , we' il do it when you get back .
all right .
i have to go .
i' m late .
bye .
nice to see you again , ma' am .
nice to see you , too .
i' il talk to you guys when you get back .
back , miss vale ?
we' il be here for quite a while .
well , bye .
honey ....
you' il never believe what happened to me today .
so , gentlemen , that' s how it is .
until grissom ... resurfaces ... ... i' m the acting president .
and i say , starting with this anniversary festival ... ... we run this city into the ground .
why don' t we hear this from grissom ?
yeah .
and what' s with that stupid grin ?
life' s been good to me .
what if we say " no " ?
well , tony ....
nobody wants a war .
if we can' t do business , we' il just shake hands and that' il be it .
yeah ?
yeah .
i got a live one here .
there' il be a hot time in the old town tonight .
antoine got a little hot under the collar .
you' re crazy .
haven' t you ever heard of the healing power of laughter ?
now get out of here !
let' s go !
move it !
you think it over .
go to the globe , follow that reporter knox .
take your camera .
see what he knows about this batman .
and , bob ...
... remember ... you ... ... are my number one ... ... guy .
yes , sir .
your pals ... ... they' re not bad people .
maybe we ... ... ought to give them a few days to think it over .
no ?
grease them now ?
okay .
you are a vicious bastard , rotelli .
i' m glad you' re dead .
i' m glad you' re dead .
i' m glad you' re dead .
i need that .
i' m losing confidence in you .
i thought we were a team .
is this a personal issue for you ?
i just want you to do your job .
i am doing my job .
and i' m protecting my partner .
there' s nothing in these files .
who is this guy ?
who cares ?
forget bruce wayne .
i' m onto batman .
they' il be out any second .
i can' t wait to hear the explanation .
what is this affidavit you filed ?
grissom gave you his business ?
mr. grissom asked me , as a personal favor ... ... to take over all his businesses until he returns .
that' s a big favor .
you two must have been very close .
did you do time together as children ?
our accountants are looking into it .
the affidavit is legitimate .
i smell fresh ink .
you can prove this ?
of course you can .
we have witnesses .
grissom' s signature is legitimate .
it is legitimate .
i saw it .
i was there .
i saw it all .
he reached up with his dead hand ... ... and signed it in his own blood .
and he did it ... with this pen .
hello , vinnie .
it' s your uncle bingo .
time to pay the check .
the pen ... ... is truly mightier than the sword .
get down !
won' t this gang war dampen the city' s 200th anniversary ?
the festival opens .
the police will stop these gangsters .
what about the theory that the batman is a mob enforcer ? i don' t have any comment .
batman .
batman .
can somebody tell me what kind of a world we live in ... ... when a man dressed as a bat ... ... gets all my press ?
this town needs an enema !
may i have a glass of ... water ?
i' m relieved that you' re home .
miss vale telephoned .
she was rather concerned .
i feel there' s a certain weight that lifts when she is here .
alfred ... ... why don' t you marry her ?
that' s not exactly what i had in mind , sir .
i can' t go on with that right now .
if not now ... ... when ?
i don' t know .
jack napier' s still alive .
he' s running grissom' s men .
i need any information on him .
yes , sir .
thank you .
alfred ....
she is great , isn' t she ?

partyman , partyman
party people say it now
yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah
the one dollar bill .
somebody holler if you wanna party
hold it !
i kind of like this one .
leave it .
you can take that off now .
you' re beautiful ... in an old fashioned kind of way .
but i' m sure we can make you more ... today .
your portfolio ?
i' m meeting someone who wants to see my work .
crap .
crap .
crap .
crap .
crap .
now that' s good work .
the skulls , the bodies .
you give it such a glow .
i don' t know if it' s art , but i like it .
let me tell you what i' m thinking about .
i was in the bath one day ... ... when i realized why i was destined for greatness .
you know how concerned people are about appearances .
this is attractive , that is not .
that is all behind me .
i now do what other people only dream .
i make art ... until someone dies .
see ?
i am the world' s first fully functioning homicidal artist .
what do you want ?
my face on the one dollar bill .
you' re joking .
do i look like i' m joking ?
no .
listen .
we mustn' t compare ourselves to regular people .
we' re artists .
for instance , let me challenge you with a piece i did .
bob .
alicia .
you will photograph and record my work .
you will join me in the avant garde of the new aesthetic .
jack , you said i could watch you improve the paintings .
i' m in trouble now .
why is she wearing a mask ?
she' s just a sketch , really .
alicia , sit down .
show the lady why you wear this mask .
alicia' s been made over in line with my new philosophy .
so now , like me ... ... she is a living work of art .
i' m no picasso , but ... do you like it ?
it' s great .
so ... what can i do for you ?
a little song , a little dance .
batman' s head on a lance .
what do you know about ... ?
i don' t know anything about batman .
really ?
well , how about a little " you and me " ?
you' re insane .
i thought i was a pisces .
come on .
let' s make up .
have a little ... ... whiff of my posy .
help me !
i' m melting !
i' m melting !
help me !
i' m melting !
hold on .
where does he get those wonderful toys ?
get in the car .
which one ?
let' s go .
shields .
how much do you weigh ?
about 108 , i think .
hold on .
grab that thing on my belt .
don' t let go .
no blood .
who is this guy ?
check his wallet .
wait .
what is that ?
some kind of body armor .
he' s human after all .
take off the mask .
shoot her !
shields open .
you weigh more than 108 .
really ?
let' s go .
stop .
where are we going ?
be careful .
bats .
they' re great survivors .
what is all this ?
the police have got it wrong .
they' re looking for one product .
the joker' s tainted hundreds of chemicals at the source .
then whole shipments would be poisoned .
and we' d all be dead .
no .
the poison only works if the components are mixed .
hairspray won' t do it alone .
but hairspray mixed with lipstick and perfume will be toxic , and traceable .
how did you figure this out ?
take that to the press .
i might have trouble with that .
a lot of people think you' re as dangerous as the joker .
he' s psychotic .
some people say the same thing about you .
what people ?
well , let' s face it .
you' re not exactly normal ... are you ?
it' s not exactly a normal world .
why did you bring me here ?
you could have sent that stuff to the press yourself .
you' re right .
there is something else you have that i want .
what ?
he took the film .
yeah ?
where have you been ?
are you okay ?
should i come over ?
no , allie .
if i bring something to you , can we make the evening edition ?
just barely .
is it hot ?
yeah , it' s real hot .
yeah , bye .
copy !
deodorants with baby powder , hairspray , and lipstick .
safe products are flying in as gotham city goes on a forced fast .
and all of gotham is wondering what to make of batman .
friend or foe ?
i have given a name to my pain ... ... and it is batman .
you must possess strength to inflict pain , bob .
we' ve got a flying mouse to kill ... ... and i want to clean my claws .
sir , miss vale called again .
dare i suggest that your present course of action ... ... might simply strengthen her resolve ?
she is quite tenacious .
you' re right .
and quite special .
perhaps you could try telling her the truth .
coming .
hi .
may i come in ?
this is a nice apartment .
lots of space .
listen , i came over to ...
... clear  i don' t know who you think you are !
you hurt me .
i know .
i called you and called you .
and you lied !
you lied about leaving town .
let me tell you why .
let me tell you !
i thought we felt something .
and i trusted you .
i even slept with you .
then you wouldn' t return my calls .
you must be some kind of jerk .
you' re a real nice girl and i like you a lot , but right now , shut up .
i have something to tell you .
you know how people have ... different sides to their personality ?
uh huh .
sometimes ... ... a person will have to actually lead a different life .
oh , my god , you' re married .
no , i' m not married .

lots of space .
vicki , we' ve really got to talk .
i' m very upset .
we were having dinner .
i was a man doing well with a beautiful woman .
and without so much as an apology ... ... you ran off with that sideshow phony .
you know ... ... i' ve recently had a tragedy in my life .
alicia ... ... threw herself out a window .
oh , my god .
but ... ... you can' t make an omelet without breaking eggs .
well , miss vale ... ... another rooster in the hen house ?
take thy beak from out my heart .
bruce ....

most of the time .
i know who you are .
let me tell you about this guy i know , jack .
mean kid .
bad seed .
hurt people .
i like him already .
you know what the problem was ?
he got sloppy .
you know , crazy .
he started to lose it .
he had a head full of bad wiring , i guess .
couldn' t keep it straight up here .
he was the kind of guy who ... ... couldn' t hear the train until it was two feet from him .
you know what happened to this guy , jack ?
well ....
he made mistakes .
then he ended up with his lights out !
now you want to get nuts ?
come on !
let' s get nuts !
tell me something .
have you ever danced with the devil in the pale moonlight ?
what ?
i always ask that of all my prey .
i just like the sound of it .
never rub another man' s rhubarb .
why is it , every time i come for you ... ... somebody always gets in the way ?
i' il need a moment alone .
i' m only laughing on the outside .
my smile is just skin deep .
if you could see inside ... ... i' m really crying .
you might join me for a weep .
you really wouldn' t believe it .
while you were entertaining , i' ve been finding out about your street corner .
i think your friend is screwed up .
more good news .
oh , my god !
his parents were murdered in that alley .
that' s why he went there .
he watched it happen in front of him .
look at the look on his face .
it was the same at city hall .
what do you suppose this does to a kid ?
vale ....
don' t get personal !
alfred ....
did you get the file on my parents ?
it' s on your table .
thank you .
what' s on your mind , alfred ?
i have no wish to fill my few remaining years ... ... grieving for the loss of old friends ...
... or their sons .
the 200th anniversary birthday gala ... ... has been indefinitely postponed .
we cannot guarantee public safety .
joker here .
we got interference .
now you fellows have said some pretty mean things .
some of which were true under that fiend ... ... boss grissom .
he was a thief ... and a terrorist .
on the other hand , he had a tremendous singing voice .
he' s dead now , and he' s left me in charge .
i can be theatrical ... ... and maybe even a little rough .
but one thing i am not ... ... is a killer !
joker : i love a good party .
so , truce .
commence au festival !
and i' ve got a surprise for gotham city .
at midnight , i will dump 20 million in cash ... ... on the crowd .
don' t worry about me . i' ve got enough .
we are not prepared to discuss any deals .
you heard it , folks , 20 million .
and there will be entertainment .
the big dukeroo .
with me in one corner , and in the other corner ... ... the man who has brought real terror to gotham city ... ... batman .

we both got to each other , didn' t we ?
why won' t you let me in ?
why ?

i' ve loved you since i met you .
but i don' t know what to think of all this .
sometimes i don' t know , either .
it' s just something i have to do .
why ?
because nobody else can .
look ....
i tried to avoid all this , but i can' t .
this is how it is .
it' s not a perfect world .
it doesn' t have to be a perfect world .
i just have to know , are we going to try to love each other ?
i' d like to .
but he' s out there right now .
and i' ve got to go to work .
joker : into the air , junior birdman !

of course , if anyone calls you " beast " ... ... i' il rip their lungs out .
mr. joker ?

and you' re so powerful .
and purple !
i love purple !

you dropped me into the chemicals !
that wasn' t easy to get over !
and don' t think i didn' t try .
i know you did .
you killed my parents .

what are you saying ?
i made you , but you made me first .
i was just a kid .
i say you made me , you say i made you .
how childish can you get ?
you wouldn' t hit a guy with glasses on ?
what are you laughing at ?
let me lend you a hand .

they don' t make them like they used to !
hey , batsy !
there he is !
down there !
it' s time to retire .
feel free to drop in .
sometimes i just kill myself !
hold on !
our police have rounded up all of the joker' s men .
the reign of crime is over .
public safety in gotham city is no longer a laughing matter .
aren' t you covering the press conference ?
no .
what about our pulitzer prize ?
what about us ?
what about your picture of batman ?
take care .
we received a letter from batman .
please inform the citizens of gotham ...
... that gotham city' s earned a rest from crime .
but if the forces of evil should rise again ...
... to cast a shadow on the heart of the city ...
... call me .
question .
how do we call him ?
he gave us a signal .
i thought champagne would be in order , ma' am .
hi , alfred .
mr. wayne told me to tell you ... ... that he might be a little late .
i' m not a bit surprised .
