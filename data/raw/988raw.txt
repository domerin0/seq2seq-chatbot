a million and a half people ride the el trains every day .
over 20 years , i' ve written wills for about 8 . 000 of ' em .
i' ve sat with ' em as they' ve combed through their assets .
figured out which kid gets the painting over the fireplace , which one gets the antique spoon collection .
last thanks , parting shots , confessions ...
people try to fit it all in .
and once i' ve finished , another life has been summed up assets and debts tallied , then zeroed out .

well , you' ve all done very very well for your first lesson .
and before you leave tonight ,
i' m gonna give you a little incentive to keep on dancing .
paulina ?

daphne ?
thank you , paulina .
whoo !
whoo !
that was beautiful .
you all right ?
yeah , i' m good .
hey , guys , wait up .
i' m comin ' .
great .
how lucky for us .
hey .
where are we goin ' ?
somewhere close .
yeah .
i haven' t got long .
anyway .
you guys .
don' t go to jim' s .
they got a bad roach problem there around the corner .
you' re gonna go anywhere after class , you come here , ok ?
thank you .
why' d you guys decide to take dance , anyway ?
i' m gettin ' married in september .
nice .
yeah .
my bride said she' d like to see me lose a few pounds .
she thinks the dancing will help .
i said it won' t .
i think you' il win that argument .
i' m taking classes to impress the ladies .
you know what they say about guys who can dance , right ?
that they' re great in bed .
yeah , baby .
where do you get that stupid crap ?
everywhere .
what do you think ?
everybody knows a guy who can move on the dance floor can move in the sack .
most guys , they can' t dance at all .
guys who can , they get their pick of the litter .
that' s why , when i' m done with this class , babes will drop at my feet .
they' re gonna be droppin ' dead at your feet .
when you took your shoes off in class today , i had to run to the window for air .
what kind of person says something like that to somebody they don' t even know ?
hey , man , i' m doin ' you a favor .
i' m telling you something obnoxious about yourself that you might not be aware of .
if there' s something obnoxious about me that you don' t think i' m aware of , y' all should feel free to say something about it to me .
shooting fish in a barrel .
where are all the ladies , anyways ?
i don' t know what i' m talking about .
the ladies , they all go and take the classes down at doctor dance that' s , like , the hip place to go downtown .
ditzy mitzi' s is only hangin ' on by a thread .
only reason i go there is she lets me rehearse whenever i want for free .
i' m gonna compete in the chicago taittinger trophy .
soon as i find a partner .
so ... that leaves you .
leaves me ?
how ?
what ?
leaves you as the only one here who hasn' t said why he' s dancing yet .
oh .
well , i' m dancing for exercise , like vern .
bull .
because i' m lousy in bed , like chic .
there , i' ve said it .
that is bull !
i didn' t say i was bad in bed .
you didn' t have to .
come on , why ?
is there any pepper here ?
could i have some ?
that' s what i thought .
she was a blackpool finalist , you know .
who ?
the princess .
the other teacher , paulina .
what' s blackpool ?
every year , all the best dancers from all over the world ... go to england to compete there .
she was there last year with her partner who they say was much more to her than just her partner .
anyway , he dumped her .
that' s the only reason she came back here to teach mad at the world , boo hoo hoo and all that .
why' d he dump her ?
yeah .
how the hell should i know ?
god , they say women gossip !
golly !
hello ?
i' m home .
great .
great , vern .
slow .
the mambo is slow .
slide that hand one inch south of the equator ... and i will bust you on your ass , twinkle toes .
let' s get something straight .
i don' t like the tropics any more than you do , ok ?
five , six , seven , eight ...
arms .
and basic .
and cross over .
right .
one more time , and walk around .
and basic .
watch out .
and big ending .
look at you , john !
that was pretty good .
you were really good .
hey , i' m sorry i' m late .
i' m gonna go up and change .
right .
dad work late tonight ?
yeah , looks that way .
guess whatever he' s working on , he must like it .
why do you say that ?
he seems happier lately .
does he ?
i called the halston people in new york .
we' re gonna have trouble getting more stock in .
everything' s on back order .
look , carolyn , i' m gonna need you to go to new york and sweet talk them .
can you leave tomorrow ?
no .
why not ?
my husband is having an affair .
how do you know that ?
i picked up the receiver last night to phone a friend , not knowing that greg was already on the other line in the den .
he was whispering .
what was he whispering ?
i don' t know .
i was so scared i hung up before i could hear anything .
well , there' s lots of other reasons why he could be whispering .
i mean , maybe he didn' t wanna wake up the kids .
huh ?
or he could be planning a surprise for you .
i mean , your birthday' s coming up , isn' t it ?
in two weeks .
that' s it .
take a breath , go get yourself a brownie in the kitchen , just chill .
it' s gonna be fine .
ok .
euh !
ooh hoo hoo !
you silly goose , you .
she' il be divorced by easter .
come on , john .
join the warm up .
ow !
jesus !
i' m sorry !
watch your floorcraft , spasmo !
what , you think you own this floor ?
i' il have a bruise the size of texas tomorrow !
go away !
go away ?
you go away !
take your stupid music with you !
i can' t dance to that crap .
you just gonna stand there and let that fat cow insult you ?
i' m sorry , what did you say ?
nothing .
she didn' t say anything .
sorry .
these are the teeth i wear for the latin .
it gets your smile out there .
just a little bit bigger smile .
bam !
gets the judges right in the eye , catches the light .
and then the make up you know the make up .
swish butt , " " fancy pants , " " pinky boy " ...
all these names , all these names i' ve been called ever since i was eight years old ... and dancing around to my mother' s rumba records .
you know what the worst of it is ?
huh ?
i' m not gay .
can you imagine how much easier my life would be if i were ?
i mean , a straight man who likes to dance around in sequins ... walks a very lonely road .
i got news for you .
look , you' re not gonna tell anybody in the office , are you ?
no , no , no .
i wouldn' t do that .
look , i' m in the same boat , aren' t i ?
no , you' re not .
you' re not .
why not ?
because ... people like you .
you know what i mean ?
you' re charming .
i' m linky link .
they would crucify me if they found out .
i' m the sports trivia king , i' m the super sports fan , you know ?
you don' t like football ?
i ...
you know .
run three yards , fall down , pile up .
run three yards , fall down , pile up .
i mean , you know , four months of that , i' m ready to put a gun to my head .
fooled me .
i know .
i fooled everybody .
you know what my dream is ?
what ?
my dream ... is to be able to dance free and proud .
under my own name .
for all the world to see .
that' s my dream .
did i get it all ?
hey , andy .
it' s bev .
look , i' m sorry to call you so late .
i was just trying to find john .
called the office at six and betsy said that he' d left for the day , and i was just ...
you got home by five ?
how did you manage that , you lucky dog ?
ah , there' s the door .
ok .
see you .
bye .
sorry i' m late .
i got hung up at the office .
i wish you' d call , ' cause we were looking all over for your car keys forever ...
i thought you were shopping with jenna .
that was weeks ago .
i called the office and betsy said you left for the day at six .
yeah , i did for a sandwich .
then i came back .
oh .
well , i called your private line a few times , nobody picked up .
that' s because i wasn' t working in my office , i was in andy' s .
oh .
how is andy ?
we' re working on a really big estate plan together .
so he was there ?
what ?
was andy there ?
why are you asking me all these questions ?
i don' t know .
anyway , i stopped off for a bite on the way home with link peterson .
remember him ?
interesting guy .
not what you' d think .
how was your day ?
great .
one , two , three , four ...
one , two , three ...
mom ?
dad' s acting weird .
they met five years ago in a chat room for gardeners .
he says they' re in love .
he' s moving out saturday .
he' il be back .
he loves those kids .
i thought we were happy .
he seemed happy to me .
i didn' t know anything .
i didn' t know .
oh ...
hi .
i , uh ...
i give free consultations during my lunch hour .
you sure you don' t wanna come in ?
so he comes home late on wednesdays , and when he comes home his shirts smell like perfume .
he' s been seen making strange body movements and you feel he has a secret .
that' s correct .
ever think about just asking him ?
yes , i' ve thought about it ...
mrs. clark ... things happen in long marriages .
to the best of people .
and sometimes the thing that happens doesn' t mean anything .
doesn' t need an investigator , just needs somebody to look the other way for a while .
my husband is a serious man , mr. devine .
if he' s having an affair , it is not casual .
in which case , the sooner i know , the better .
all right .
give me a moment while i call in my associate , mr. harcourt .
scottie !
scottie harcourt , this is mrs. clark .
she suspects her husband' s up to no good .
to catch a husband is an art .
to hold him is a job .
simone de beauvoir said that .
it' s very nice to meet you , mrs. clark .
same here .
i think we can start this investigation without too much cost to mrs. clark .
yes .
follow that husband around for a few days , take some pictures , see what' s up .
but i have to warn you , if it goes to trial it' s gonna be ...
trial ?
in the event of a divorce .
but we don' t know if he' s having an affair .
i mean , he could just be involved with ...
i don' t know ... people who get together to invest things , and ... and the place that they invest things is ... filled with potpourri , and that' s why his shirts smell so sweet when he comes home .
it' s possible .
yeah , it' s possible .
it' s possible .
it' s possible we could find your husband neck deep in potpourri , investing things .
not likely .
look , this is what we' il do .
we start out gently .
we look for the potpourri .
and if we find it , and it smells like flowers , then 2, 000 ought to cover my time .
but if we find the potpourri and there' s something big and stinky in the pot , then you and i renegotiate , ok ?
that sound good ?
ok .
hey .
hi .
how you doin ' ?
good .
i can tell , you know .
tell what ?
that you' ve been dancing .
your posture , it' s a dead giveaway .
you' re kidding .
no .
how much you been practicing , anyway ?
just in class .
no .
should be five to one .
five to one ratio .
five hours of practice for every one hour of class .
doctor dance has an open dance party every thursday .
anybody can go and practice .
even you .
ballroom is all or nothing , john .
i' m draggin ' your ass out of class and onto a real dance floor .
we' il go straight there after work .
link ?
yeah ?
can you really tell ?
yeah .
having fun ?
what are you doing here ?
spying .
excuse me , we were dancing together .
dude , she does not wanna dance with you .
now back off .
hey , you know , i ...
link always insists on dancing with the youngest girls .
i' ve never seen him with his perfect partner .
not that those are easy to find .
have you ever found one ?
once .
he was my dancing partner for 15 years .
we were husband and wife for 14 .
wow .
yeah .
he was my perfect partner .
doesn' t happen twice in a lifetime .
i' m lucky it even happened once .
ah !
at last , a song i know .
oh , i love this song .
# da da da da ...
# shall we still be together with our arms around each other
# and shall you be my new romance ?
# on the clear understanding that this kind of thing can happen
# shall we dance , shall we dance , shall we dance ?
it' s the king and i. yul brynner and deborah kerr .
do you remember that ?
they held hands like this ...
oh , come on , john , let' s try it .
no .
no , no , no , i can' t .
no way .
i can' t .
why not ?
oh , john , come on .
come on .
i don' t ...
no , i don' t want to ...
let go , john .
that' s it , john .
whoa !
sorry !
i wasn' t watching .
hi !
how are you ?
it doesn' t matter .
we' re finished anyway .
what do you mean ?
no offense , but i can' t be your dance partner .
why ?
you' re too much of a freak .
i mean , look at your palms .
they' re bright orange from self tanning lotion .
don' t you know you' re supposed to wash your hands after you use that stuff ?
excuse me .
miss mitzi couldn' t make it tonight , so i' il be your teacher .
i' m paulina .
and you' re ...
chic and vern and ...
tom .
john .
it' s john .
what would you like to work on tonight ?
well , in my opinion chic i think since we' re beginners , a good idea would be ...
waltz .
maybe the waltz .
ok .
um ...
i' il work with you one at a time and you can be first .
ok .
all right .
oops .
i' m sorry .
so are you really a reporter for the times .
or are you just pickin ' up on her , like everybody else ?
i' m a reporter .
plus , she' s not my type .
i like a woman built for comfort , not for speed .
really ?
why don' t you put the camera down and take me out on the dance floor ?
i' m working and this is not my type of dance .
well , how do you know if you' ve never tried ?
come on , put the camera down .
come on , give me a shot .
oh , dear !
sorry , sorry !
i' m sorry .
it' s gonna stain .
don' t ... worry .
i' il take care of it .
would you like to use this ?
excuse me ?
just to wipe your coat , or ...
go ahead , just take it .
please .
go ahead .
it' s silly , but it' s my favorite coat .
i' m sorry .
it' s vintage .
but this part' s real suede , so now it' s ruined .
you sure ?
maybe they can fix that .
no .
i know about stains .
it' s ...
you know , i never understood that .
i never understood
live cows get dirty all the time , they don' t get stained .
all that leather stands in the mud , nothing happens .
go figure .
what is that ?
exactly .
get a little sauce on your coat and look .
why is that ?
i don' t know .
we' il have to ask the next cow that comes by .
a man with a handkerchief .
wow .
i didn' t know they made those anymore .
i haven' t eaten yet .
if you haven' t eaten yet , maybe we can go and ... get a bite .
someplace close .
you know , i saw a chinese over here .
we could use chopsticks and drop an endless variety of things on our clothes .
i' m sorry , i prefer not to socialize with students .
oh .
ok .
all right .
i shouldn' t have taken this from you .
i' il buy you a new one .
please .
i didn' t ...
i didn' t mean anything by that .
i' il buy you a new one .
excuse me .
mr. clark , i take dance very seriously .
miss mitzi' s is a school , not a disco .
and i hope you didn' t join class with me as your goal , because you' d be wasting your time .
don' t dance if that' s what you' re after .
dance lessons ?
my husband is taking dance lessons ?
well , i' ve found a lot worse hiding in the potpourri over the years .
consider yourself lucky .
what' s this beautiful young woman ?
who' s she ?
his substitute teacher .
his regular teacher' s a much older woman .
great legs , but older .
mr. devine , what would make a man who' s done the same thing for the last 20 years ... suddenly do something so completely out of character just out of the blue ?
that' s a question for a shrink .
i' m just a detective .
i' m not asking you as a detective .
i' m asking you as a man .
scottie ?
what would cause a man after 20 years ... to do something completely out of character out of the blue ?
did i get that right ?
yeah .
the mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation .
maybe the desperation can' t be quiet anymore .
bingo .
that' s a wonderful use of thoreau , scottie .
thank you .
hello again , mrs. clark .
hey .
desperation .
well , that' s a possibility .
mrs. clark , the point is your husband' s dancing , he' s not checking into hotel rooms .
we can continue to keep an eye on things for you , but my guess is your husband will hang up his dancing shoes shortly anyway .
what makes you say that ?
voice of experience .
you give him some time .
he' il be home soon .
the rest is up to you " , i tell my clients .
the rest is up to you .
every few years they come back .
so i have these snapshots in my head of how they' ve changed over the years .
the ones who' ve changed the most finally bought that boat .
moved to that island .
those who haven' t changed ...
i suppose they take comfort in knowing what course their lives are on .
they like to believe they know what lies ahead .
shit !
dad !
evan !
what are you doing here ?
trying to meet up with some friends .
what are you doing here ?
well , you know , work ...
i had to come to visit a client over here .
i had to come by and ...
it' s really weird .
it is ?
yeah .
because i' ve been wanting you to meet this girl that i' m crazy about , and i' m going to meet her right now at this bar with my other friends .
so can you ...
do you wanna go ?
of course i do .
lead on , my son .
come on , let' s get out there .
so , does your dad wanna dance ?
i don' t know .
dad , you haven' t danced in , what , 90 years ?
you two go .
go .
it' s been a long day for me .
mr. clark ?
mr. clark ?
do you wanna dance ?
yes .
yes , i do .
ok .
could you say goodbye to evan for me ?
thank you .
sure .
sorry i' m late .
don' t let it happen again .
join the warm up , john .
come on !
christ , vern !
you' re soaking wet , man .
i already had a shower today .
sorry .
you' re disgusting !
you don' t have to put it like that .
why not ?
it' s the truth .
and i prefer to tell the truth , unlike some people who make up stories about nonexistent fiances .
what are you talking about ?
he' s getting married in the fall .
oh , come on .
what , are ya dumb ?
people who are engaged take the classes together , or what the hell' s the point ?
come on , tell the people the truth .
you' re not engaged , are you ?
huh ?
not exactly .
uh huh .
i haven' t asked her quite yet .
thank you very much .
look , i was gonna lose some weight first , and then i was gonna take her dancing somewhere romantic .
and then maybe pop the question .
but i guess if i' m sweating all over the place , that wouldn' t be too romantic , huh ?
she' s a great dancer .
well , hey , don' t listen to me .
what , are you ...
c' mon , don' t be a big baby .
i didn' t mean to upset you or anything .
jesus , vern .
i said i was sorry .
bobbie !
somebody call a doctor .
are you all right ?
she' s out .
it' s her electrolytes .
they get crazy because she overworks herself .
she' s been in here twice before .
and it' s getting so boring , mom .
shut up , tina .
no , you shut up .
god , she pisses me off .
she pulls a 12 hour shift at jimmy' s diner , working five till five , and then she goes and cooks and cleans for an old feeb in a wheelchair ... to earn extra money for her crazy costumes .
and then she plays cinderella every night at dance practice .
when you should be home , resting .
i don' t need rest .
right .
you need to hang out and flirt with the shy guy with the nice smelling sweat .
she told me all about you .
shut up , tina .
i never said his sweat smells nice .
i never said ...
she said it was the best smelling sweat she' d ever smelled .
ok , kill me now .
it' s all right , bobbie .
i' ve smelled his sweat and i agree , it' s not bad .
well , i mean , it' s no field of flowers after a spring rain ...
yeah , i think we' ve talked about this enough .
maybe we should all go home now and let bobbie get some rest .
yeah .
bye , sweetheart .
thank you .
thank you .
bobbie needs a partner for the competition .
why not you , john ?
me ?
competition ?
no , no , i can' t ...
she' d never go for it anyway .
forget it .
why not ?
what are you talking about ?
you heard her daughter she likes you .
and dance begins with the dancers ' feelings .
i' il work with the both of you after class .
two extra hours .
the miss mitzi special .
we' ve got three months .
this is good .
what do you think ?
i think you better stock up on deodorant .
anything a client says in a lawyer' s office is confidential .
so i' ve gotten used to holding onto secrets .
they' re usually nothing incriminating .
but a lot of people have accounts they haven' t reconciled things they' re just not ready to share .
i took the liberty of ordering for you .
bombay sapphire , three limes .
i hired you to watch my husband .
you' re not supposed to be watching me .
it' s very hard not to , mrs. clark with all due respect .
are you a married man , mr. devine ?
i was .
oh , what happened ?
unfaithful .
she hired a detective ?
no , no , no .
when she found out , i was too far gone , so ...
you' re smiling at me .
you are on a strange journey to redemption , mr. devine .
and a very long one , mrs. clark .
all these promises that we make and we break .
why is it , do you think , that people get married ?
passion .
no .
that' s interesting .
because i would' ve taken you for a romantic .
why , then ?
because we need a witness to our lives .
there' s a billion people on the planet .
i mean , what does any one life really mean ?
but in a marriage , you' re promising to care about everything the good things , the bad things , the terrible things , the mundane things ...
all of it .
all the time , every day .
you' re saying , " your life will not go unnoticed , because i will notice it .
your life will not go unwitnessed , because i will be your witness .
you can quote me on that , if you like .
i' m sure i will .
anyway , the reason that i called you here today , to tell you in person that i won' t be needing your services anymore .
oh .
i think to continue ... would be an unwarranted invasion of my husband' s privacy and ...
anyway , even though there was a reason ...
i' m sorry for what i' ve done and i know enough now and ... it' s time to stop .
thank you for everything and ... goodbye .
bye .
mrs. clark ?
i was right .
you are a romantic .
bobbie !
a new costume .
yeah .
i got it from this mermaid dream i had in the hospital .
just floated up from my subconscious .
where , tragically , it did not stay .
come on , partner .
what are you waiting for ?
divine intervention ?
you' re a brave man , john clark .
not just anyone could take on the bobbinator .
yeah .
good luck , man .
we' re with you .
somebody help me up !
please ?
john !
ok .
55 days from today you two are gonna win the novice competition .
that means you' re gonna have to master five dances .
i' ve asked paulina to videotape you tonight , so you can see what you' re doing wrong .
let' s start with a rumba .
what ?
what is it ?
it' s the rumba .
it' s the dance of love .
and he' s just not giving me anything .
what does she want me to do ?
i' m doing it exactly the way i was taught .
you think it' s easy ... ?
the rumba ... is a vertical expression of a horizontal wish .
you have to hold her like the skin on her thigh is your reason for living .
let her go like your heart' s being ripped from your chest .
pull her back like you' re gonna have your way with her , right here on the dance floor .
and then finish ...
like she' s ruined you for life .
see ?
why can' t you just do it like that ?
anyone else care for a glass of water ?
damn it !
no , not you .
look , i have to call you back .
no , he' s not home yet .
what was the score at half time in the nba playoffs last night ?
why ?
why ?
you said you watched .
what was the score ?
i forget now .
you didn' t forget .
you didn' t watch .
you don' t care about playoffs .
you care about dancing !
shh !
i do not .
yeah ?
then what' s this ?
give me that !
no !
give me that !
give me ...
it' s not even mine .
it' s my mother' s .
at least , it was my mother' s until i took it to this wonderful alterations guy ... who had it tailored for me .
look , it' s not like i' ve figured this out either .
hey , listen ...
what ?
come back to class .
no .
you could take over as bobbie' s partner in the latin dances .
you' ve got those knocked already .
there' s no way i could learn ' em in time .
i' m not comin ' back as the bobbinator' s partner !
we' il look like an olive and a toothpick together .
besides , she would never dance with me .
sure she would .
just the latin dances .
i' il still do the waltz and the quickstep .
she would .
no !
not if he was the last bald , bad breathed , heterosexual sequin freak on earth which he probably is .
i' m not doin ' it .
you wanna win the latin competition or not ?
it' s up to you .
i don' t care .
link already knows the dances .
and he' il be a good competitor .
right , link ?
so , finally giving up on the underage bimbettes ... and gonna go for a real woman ?
is that it ?
yeah , no more underage bimbettes for me .
only real women from now on .
don' t even think about coming near me without a breath mint .
you got that ?
and quit lookin ' at my ass .
we' il try .
vern , you know , there' s a joyful freedom in your latin .
and chic , you have an innate sensuality quite uncommon in a man .
i' ve entered you both in the competition along with john .
good .
that' s settled .
you ... are the frame .
i' m the frame .
she is the picture ...
she is the picture ... ... in your frame .
everything that you do is to show her off .
you got that ?
i didn' t hear that .
nice .
invite the lady in .
and ... make the connection .
projecting to the third balcony .
911 !
911 , quick !
quick , 911 !
9 ...
and start here with an initial sweep past the crowd .
watch .
and contra check .
excellent .
oh , jesus .
we wanted something unusual .
are you ok ?
yeah .
you sure ?
no , i' m good .
but you guys look exhausted .
i tell you what , why don' t we call it a night ?
for your sake , john .
you look like you' re toast .
and tomorrow' s a big day .
yeah .
get home safe .
ok .
i' m wearing you guys out .
no .
no , no , no .
it' s good .
i like it when my feet hurt .
takes my mind off my knees .
i' ve just been getting carried away , you know , working hard with the two of you .
i guess i like it .
feels good , you know ?
for me too .
all right .
well , i' m going home .
hey , wait .
i wanted to talk to you about that night that you asked me to dinner .
i' m sorry about how i treated you .
it' s just , you know , that people get the wrong idea about me all the time .
paulina , you don' t have to explain anything to me , ever .
well , i know i don' t have to explain anything to anybody ... because i don' t care what people think about me .
good .
good .
i mean it .
yeah , uh huh .
good .
good .
i' m sorry .
i shouldn' t be here right now .
no , it' s ok .
i think i' m just hungry or something .
hungry ?
very .
oh , this is so stupid .
no .
no , not at all .
no , no .
i cry too when i' m hungry .
for french fries , usually .
you ?
cake .
careful .
don' t spill it on your new coat .
old coat , new color .
i had it dyed .
yeah ?
yeah , my dad did it .
he' s a dry cleaner .
as is my mom , my brother , my two older sisters and me .
i told you i know about stains .
you' re a dry cleaner ?
well , i was .
until i was eight .
actually , that' s when i started dancing .
i was helping out in the store one day after school ... when my mom asked me to go in the back and get an order .
it was this incredibly delicate sequined thing , held together by a gold thread .
well , i carried the costume like it was gonna break .
and then i saw the customer .
she was the most beautiful woman i had ever laid eyes on .
she invited us to see her dance that night .
and my mother said yes .
it was like the whole world had suddenly gone from black and white to color .
the beautiful woman and her partner stopped right in front of us ... and did a waltz pose .
she tilted her head back and she winked at me .
and i felt like she was trying to tell me something .
i took it as a sign .
and from then on .
i knew that ballroom dancing would be my life .
it wasn' t the kind of dream my parents had in mind .
what made you wanna dance ?
you .
looking out that window , right up there .
you can see it from the train and ... every night i' d come home from work and i' d look for you , your face .
you looked on the outside the way i was feeling on the inside .
i was watching you too .
from the window i saw you practicing on the platform .
no !
oh ...
that night i said all those things to you , i didn' t think i' d ever see you again .
but you kept coming back .
i didn' t want to .
but i figured if i hadn' t , you' d have been right about everything you accused me of .
then i started dancing and i found i really liked it .
it made me happy .
yes , it shows .
i mean , i feel excited about something for the first time in such a long time .
aren' t you ?
excited ?
about tomorrow .
the competition .
no , no , no .
i' m petrified .
i' m ...
i' m gonna forget everything , i won' t be able to put one foot in front of the other ,
i' il make a mess of the whole thing .
no .
give me one hour .
leave it .
leave the light .
don' t say anything ... and don' t think .
and don' t move unless you feel it .
be this alive .
be this alive tomorrow .
thank you .
god , i' m sorry .
i' m sorry , i lost my balance .
oh , that' s ok .
i lost my fianc .
lisa !
lisa .
there you are .
found the earring .
john clark .
photo op .
come on .
smile , everyone .
paso doble !
good luck , everybody .
good luck .
hey .
yeah .
so what did i tell you ?
girls love guys who can dance , right ?
even i got a partner .
check it out .
cute .
but who' s the guy ?
oh , that' s her brother .
yeah , we play basketball together .
aren' t they adorable ?
they' re gonna get slaughtered .
oh , shh .
don' t say that .
mr. clark .
john ?
you look blue .

ladies and gentlemen , good evening .

music , please .
nice chass , vern !
whoa !
let' s hear it for the cha cha , ladies and gentlemen .
who' s your favorite couple out there ?
let them hear their numbers .
we danced like shit !
all you did was worry about that stupid wig !
well , what did you expect me to do ?
you saw ...
i know , he' s a pig .
but you know what ?
this is latin .
the judges are looking at your hips , not your hair .
so unless that thing looks good on your ass , lose it !
fine !
we love you , baldy !
thank you , dancers .
please take your positions for your second and final dance of this competition , the paso doble .
music , please .
looks like he got rid of a lot more than the wig .
ladies and gentlemen , i have the final results for the latin competition .
your finalists are ... couple 102 ...
we did it !
lisa , we did it , we did it !
couple 104 .
oh , my god !
oh , my god !
couple 106 .
couple 109 .
couple 110 .
and couple 105 ... has been disqualified .

i thought slick willy was pretty good .
bad attitude .
ungentlemanly behavior .
it' s a british sport , after all .
the man was working it .
well ...
immediately following , the standard competition .
ladies and gentlemen , the chicago taittinger trophy standard competition will now begin .

and finally , couple number 126 .
there they are .
yeah .
they look nervous .
no , not them .
them .
you invited them ?
she said she wanted to be a witness to her husband' s life .
i thought she should witness this .

dad , you were terrific .

beverly , how did you know ?
because i hired a detective .
yeah .
i thought you were having an affair .
it' s ridiculous , i know .
ok .
i feel ...
hey , listen , that was really bad luck .
don' t worry .
there' s always next year .
oh , " there' s always next year . " thanks .
well , i have a whole year to prepare for it .
beverly , please , can we talk ...
no , there' s nothing to talk about .
please .
will you please stay here ...
stop .

please , will you talk to me ?
if you want to talk , you can start by explaining what was it that i just saw in there ?
what did i witness ?
i' m not having an affair .
there was no aff ...
what' s goin ' on ?
let' s go !
they' re new friends .
but you could' ve told me about it , couldn' t you ?
you just completely left me out .
why didn' t you tell me , john ?
you' ve gotta answer that .
i was ashamed .
ashamed of what ?
of dancing ?
well , no , no ...
well , then of what ?
of wanting to be happier .
when we have so much .
and it' s not your fault .
hey , fred astaire !
you' re blocking traffic !
finally !
thank you !
the reading of a will can actually come as a kind of relief .
after the initial shock wears off about that trust fund for the family dog , or the opera seats left to the gardener , there is at least the sense that everything is finally out on the table .
this , you are not gonna believe this , guys .
louis , louis .
link started dancing in 1985 .
it soon became his passion and he started dancing six days a week .
lawyer by day and dancer by night ,
link really lights up the floor with all of his energy .
see ?
i told you .
i knew it .
i knew link peterson was a freaky bastard .
i think linky link might be batting for the other team , you know what i mean ?
could those pants be any tighter ?
look at his package !
somebody get a magnifying glass !
there is nothing wrong with ballroom dancing .
sorry .
oh ...
fuck you all .
and football sucks .
hey , how you doin ' ?
hey .
surprise .
this is gorgeous .
yeah , it' s a pretty spot .
thanks .
john , look , we just wanted to talk to you for a minute .
yeah , i just hope that you weren' t staying away from class on account of me .
i' m not mad about you ripping my dress or anything .
seriously .
i mean , i know you always wanted to look at my ass ... and i think you picked a pretty weird time to do it , but i forgive you , john .
thanks .
thank you .
honestly .
ok ?
come on , can we tell miss mitzi you' re coming back ?
i' m sorry , guys , i' m not coming back .
it' s ...
it' s ...
i' m done with that now .
but thanks a lot for coming out here .
i really appreciate that .
john , look ...
paulina , you know , she' s gonna go to england to study dance , and we' re havin ' a little , you know , going away party for her ... and we' d love for you to come .
really love it if you would come by .
she gave me this to give to you , so ...
anyway , we hope that we see you there .
all right ?
all right , come on .
bye , john .
bye .
i hope you' re not upset about what happened with you and bobbie .
because you were wonderful that night .
i' d hate to think that what happened would make you give it all up .
you looked so graceful and brave out there a different person from the one who first walked into miss mitzi' s studio .
but a lot has changed for both of us over the last few months .
when my partner and i went to blackpool last year ... we were so excited to make it to the finals .
everyone was convinced that we were going to win .
and we wanted to prove them right .
we' d been together as a couple for as long as we' d been partners .
but we began training too hard .
pushing each other .
expecting too much .
well , we didn' t win .
not even close .
i came back without my trophy or my partner .
and all this time i' ve been hiding out at miss mitzi' s .
angry at myself .
frustrated and embarrassed .
but coaching you and bobbie , seeing how alive you were out there ... made me realize just how much i' d given up .
and now , for the first time in a long time ...
i want to dance again .
so i need to thank you thank you for helping me to see this .
i hope i get to see you and dance with you once more before i leave .
paulina .
thanks .
by the way , i' m not going to this party .
oh , ok .
but you' re not giving up dancing , are you ?
you could ... teach me to dance .
beverly , i' m not dancing anymore .
why not , dad ?
why don' t you teach mom how to dance ?
the one thing i am proudest of in my whole life ... is that you are happy with me .
if i couldn' t ... if i couldn' t tell you that i was unhappy sometimes , it was because i didn' t want to risk hurting the one person i treasure most .
i' m so sorry .
