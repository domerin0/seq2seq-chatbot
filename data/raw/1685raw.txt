it' s an important and popular fact that things are not always what they seem .
for instance , on the planet earth , man had always assumed that he was the most intelligent species occupying the planet , instead of the third most intelligent .
the second most intelligent creatures were dolphins , who , curiously enough , had long known of the impending destruction of the planet earth .
they' d made many attempts to alert mankind , but most of their communications were misinterpreted as amusing attempts to punch footballs or whistle for tidbits .
so they eventually decided they would leave earth by their own means .
the last ever dolphin message was misinterpreted as a sophisticated attempt to do a backward somersault through a hoop , whistling the star spangled banner .
" so long and thanks for all the fish .
the extraordinary story of the hitchhiker' s guide to the galaxy begins very simply .
it begins with a man .
ooh !
an earthman , to be precise .
who no more knows his destiny , than a tea leaf knows the history of the east india company .
his name is arthur dent .
he is a five foot eight inch tall ape descendant and someone is trying to drive a bypass through his house .
what do i want you to do about it ?
find him and tell him i' m currently lying flat on my back in front of ...
fine , i' il hold .
you can' t lie in front of the bulldozers for ever .
i' m game .
we' il see who rusts first .
this bypass has got to be built and it is going to be built .
why has it got to be built ?
it' s a bypass .
you' ve got to build bypasses .
besides , you should' ve protested months ago .
the plans have been on display at the planning office for a year .
on display ?
i had to go down to a cellar .
mr dent , have you any idea how much damage this bulldozer would suffer if i just let it roll straight over you ?
how much ?
none at all .
by a strange coincidence , none at all is exactly how much suspicion ape descendant arthur had that one of his closest friends was not descended from an ape , but was , in fact , from a small planet somewhere in the vicinity of betelgeuse .
arthur !
arthur !
ford !
yes ?
here .
ah , there you are !
eat , drink .
we gotta talk .
now' s not the best time .
they' re going to demolish my home .
whoa !
you already ...
you already know ?
how ?
what do you m ... ?
oh , they , they ?
when you say " they " you mean they ?
got it .
listen .
i got somethin ' important i gotta tell you .
right now .
well , what about my house ?
workers of the earth , i bring good tidings of peanuts and beer !
good .
let' s go to the pub .
huh ?
they won' t demolish it until they' ve finished the beers .
can we trust ' em ?
to the end of the earth .
how far' s that ?
about 1 2 minutes away .
huh ?
barman , six pints of bitter and quickly .
the world' s about to end .
barman , six pints of bitter and quickly .
the world' s about to end .
six pints coming up .
keep the change .
you got about ten minutes to spend it .
three pints each ?
at lunchtime ?
sorry .
ah .
time is an illusion .
lunchtime , doubly so .
and eat those peanuts , because you' il need the salt .
look , what is going on , ford ?
arthur ...
what if i told you i really wasn' t from guildford ?
i was from a small planet somewhere in the vicinity of betelgeuse ?
is that something you' re likely to say ?
remember when we met ?
out the way !
oof !
hi .
wasn' t it strange i was trying to shake hands with a car ?
i assumed you were drunk .
i thought cars were the dominant life form .
i was introducing myself .
you saved my life .
and now i' m saving yours .
please drink .
it must be thursday .
i could never get the hang of thursdays .
if this is about your house ...
no , it' s not about the house .
who' s he ?
she .
she .
tricia mcmillan .
we met at a fancy dress party .
i hate those kind of parties .
i' d rather have stayed at home and ironed my hankies .
but there i was .
who are you ?
oh !
and there she was .
uh , dent .
arthur dent .
oh , no .
i mean , who are you ?
oh , the costume ?
right .
livingstone , i presume !
yeah , it' s not as clever as darwin , but the best i could do at short notice .
you' re the first to get that right .
really ?
yes .
everyone calls me santa .
right .
i thought the beagle was a giveaway .
so did l .
people at these parties are drunken idiots .
what ?
all these people are idiots !
god !
that' s awkward .
tell me .
she was amazing though , ford .
beautiful , witty , mad as a balloon .
uh , without the beard , you look at least 80 years younger .
maybe i' m de evolving .
well , i should tell you that i do not date single celled organisms , okay ?
let' s go somewhere .
yeah .
definitely .
um , where do you have in mind ?
madagascar .
is that that new club on dean street ?
no , it' s a country off the coast of africa .
that madagascar ?
why are we waiting here ?
wait a sec .
go .
god , you' re serious .
um , i can' t go to madagascar .
why not ?
because , i just , you know ...
you' re serious ?
yeah .
i want to go somewhere i' ve never been and i' d like to go with you , so ... ... what do you say , dr livingstone ?
i say that' s an extraordinary proposition .
i can' t go .
i mean , i' ve got a job .
quit .
get a new one when you come back .
i don' t even know your real name .
ow !
ow !
tricia mcmillan .
well , tricia mcmillan .
um , i have a proposition for you .
why don' t we go somewhere a little closer first , say cornwall , and we' il see how it goes .
right , of course , cornwall .
hey , excuse me .
is this guy boring you ?
why don' t you talk to me instead ?
i' m from a different planet .
it' s true .
you want to see my spaceship ?
do you want to see my spaceship ?
what kind of chat up line is that ?
mm , that does happen .
speaking of ...
we' ve got two minutes .
drink up .
that' s my house .
people of earth , a round of drinks , for everyone , on me .
you really think the world' s going to end ?
yes .
shouldn' t we lie down , or put a paper bag over our heads , or something ?
if you like .
will it help ?
not at all .
see you .
last orders !
what is that ?
run !
look out !
aha !
towel !
arthur !
what the hell are those things ?
yeow !
they' re ships from a vogon constructor fleet .
i picked up their signal this morning .
you' il need this .
what are you doing ?
we' re hitching a ride .
um , people of earth , this is prostetnic vogon jeltz of the galactic hyperspace planning council .
as you are probably aware , plans for the development of the outlying regions of the galaxy involve the building of a hyperspace express route through your star system .
and your planet is one of those scheduled for demolition .
there' s no point acting surprised about it .
the plans have been on display at your local planning office in alpha centauri for 50 earth years .
if you can' t be bothered with local affairs , that' s your lookout .
apathetic bloody planet .
i' ve no sympathy at all .
the hitchhiker' s guide to the galaxy is a wholly remarkable book .
perhaps the most remarkable , certainly the most successful , ever to come out of the great publishing corporations of ursa minor .
more popular than the celestial homecare omnibus , better selling than 53 more things to do in zero gravity , and more controversial than oolon colluphid' s trilogy of philosophical blockbusters , where god went wrong ,
some more of god' s greatest mistakes , and who is this god person anyway ?
it' s already supplanted the encyclopedia galactica as the standard repository of all knowledge and wisdom for two important reasons .
first , it' s slightly cheaper , and second , it has the words " don ' t panic " printed in large , friendly letters on its cover .
so you ' re not from guildford ?
which would explain the accent , which i' ve always wondered about .
um , you' re not an out of work actor , but rather a writer for this , this book thing .
good , huh ?
i don' t feel well .
i need a cup of tea .
if i asked where we were , would i regret it ?
we' re safe for now .
good .
we' re in the washroom on one of the ships of the vogon constructor fleet .
oh , get me home , ford .
arthur , your home is ...
oh , god , my home .
my home was demolished .
you don' t remember .
okay , arthur , i' ve got something to tell you .
it' s unfortunate , but it' s true .
your home planet has been blown up .
huh , blown up .
couldn' t you have done something ?
i saved your life .
okay , that makes us even .
it' s a tough galaxy .
if you want to survive out here , you' ve ... ... gotta know where your towel is .
okay , give me a hand over here .
careful .
it' s hot .
we' ve gotta get off this ship .
before the vogons find us .
vogons , they hate hitchhikers .
pull .
huh ?
now we' il get a signal .
what is a vogon ?
ask the guide .
say " vogons " .
vogons .
vogons are one of the most unpleasant races in the galaxy .
not evil , but bad tempered , bureaucratic , officious and callous .
they wouldn' t even lift a finger to save their own grandmothers from the ravenous bugblatter beast of traal without orders signed in triplicate , sent in , sent back , queried , lost , found , subjected to public inquiry ,
iost again and finally buried in soft peat for three months and recycled as firelighters .
on no account should you allow a vogon to read poetry to you .
they can' t think or imagine .
most can' t spell .
they just run things .
hmm ?
and if we don' t get a ride soon , we won' t need the guide to tell us how unpleasant the vogons are .
they' ve already destroyed a planet today .
that always makes them a little eee !
ughh !
what is that ?
put this in your ear .
huh ?
we have unwittingly picked up a couple of hitchhikers .
the fish is translating for you .
the babel fish is small , yellow , leech like , and probably the oddest thing in the universe .
it feeds on brainwave energy , absorbing unconscious frequencies , and excreting a matrix of conscious frequencies to the speech centers of the brain .
the practical upshot of which is that , if you stick one in your ear , you instantly understand anything said to you in any language .
resistance is useless .
all right .
someone' s coming .
here we go .
look lively .
wheee !
ha , ha !
hmmm .
sir .
what ?
hitchhikers .
o freddled gruntbuggly ...
no , really , you don' t have to read .
we' ve put you through enough trouble already . " ... as plerdled gabbleblotchits on a lurgid bee .
vogon poetry is widely accepted as the third worst in the universe .
the second worst is that of the azgoths of kria .
during a recitation by their poet master , grunthos the flatulent , of his poem ode to a small lump of green putty
i found in my armpit one midsummer morning , four of his audience died of internal hemorrhaging , and the president of the mid galactic arts nobbling council survived by gnawing one of his own legs off .
or i will rend thee in the gobberwarts ...
" ... with my blurgle ...
the absolute worst poetry was by paula millstone jennings of sussex .
luckily , it was destroyed when the earth was .
see if i don' t . " yeah .
so , earthlings , i present you with a choice .
either die in the vacuum of space , or tell me what you thought of my poem .
a ... a ... actually , i rather liked it .
hmm ?
yeah .
that' s good .
run with it .
hmmm .
uh , some of the words i didn' t understand , but i found the imagery quite effective .
continue .
well , uh , yes , interesting rhythmic devices , which seemed to counterpoint the underlying metaphor of the humanity of ...
vogonity !
vogonity , sorry , vogonity ... of the poet' s soul .
so what you' re saying is ,
i write poetry because underneath this mean , callous , heartless exterior ,
i just want to be loved ?
yes , yes , yes .
yes , yes , yeah , please .
ahh , ooh , ooh , mmm .
throw them off the ship !
no !
no !
ford .
ford !
ahh !
all right !
all right !
resistance is useless !
shut up !
get a job !
wash your filthy hands !
don' t panic .
don' t panic .
so this is it ?
we' re going to die ?
yeah , we' re gonna die .
no , no , what' s this ?
what is this ?
what' s this ?
this is ... nothing .
yeah , we' re gonna die .
you' re sweating .
would you like a hug ?
no .
space , " says the introduction to the hitchhiker' s guide ,
is big .
really big .
you just won' t believe how vastly , hugely , mind bogglingly big it is .
a ... a ... and so on .
it also says that if you hold a lungful of air , you can survive in the total vacuum of space for about 30 seconds .
but with space being really big and all , the chances of being picked up within that time are two to the power of two billion , 79 million , 460 thousand , 347 to one against .
by a staggering coincidence , it' s also the phone number of the islington flat , where arthur went to a fancy dress party and met a very nice young woman whom he totally blew it with .
though the planet earth , the islington flat and telephone have all now been demolished , ford and arthur were , in fact , rescued .
ford ?
y es .
i think i' m a sofa .
i know how you feel .
so much for the laws of physics .
and our top story .
the sensational theft of the most coveted ship in the universe , the starship heart of gold .
stolen at the launch ceremony by none other than galactic president zaphod beeblebrox .
in the name of people , freedom , and , uh ... democracy , stuff like that ,
i hereby kidnap myself and i' m taking the ship with me .
whoo !
come on !
beeblebrox , universally considered to be the dimmest star in several solar systems , is most famous for his controversial defeat of humma kavula who claimed many thought they were voting for the worst dressed being in the universe contest .
great .
kavula is best remembered for his slanderous
don ' t vote for stupid ! " campaign .
put your ego aside .
something important has happened .
if there' s anything more important than my ego , i want it caught and shot now .
come on , i love it .
zaphod' s just this guy , you know .
hey , hey , hey , hey .
what d' you ... ?
i was just watching myself .
we have a couple of hitchhikers .
hitchhikers ?
why' d you pick up hitchhikers ?
i didn' t .
the ship did .
what ?
wh ... wh ...
say what ?
when we engaged the lmprobability drive ...
the big button .
i know .
they were picked up here .
in sector zz9 plural z alpha .
wait .
that' s where you picked me up .
on earth .
that' s impossible .
no , just very improbable .
listen .
i don' t have time for this .
we' ve got the police of half the galaxy after us .
we' ve stopped for hitchhikers .
so ten out of ten for style , but ... ... minus several million for good thinking .
you' re too gorgeous , baby , stop it .
you drive me crazy .
don' t .
i' il send marvin .
marvin .
you ought to know , i' m feeling very depressed .
well , we have something that should take your mind off things .
it won' t work .
i have an exceptionally large mind .
yeah , we know .
but we need you to go down to the number two entry bay and pick up our stowaways and bring them up here .
just that ?
i won' t enjoy it .
yeah , well , that' s life .
life ?
don' t talk to me about life .
commander kwaltz .
yes .
we have located the spaceship heart of gold and president beeblebrox .
where ?
sector zz9 plural z alpha .
requesting hyperspace clearance .
hold your position , captain , until clearance is granted .
yes , sir .
get me vice president questular .
hyperspace permission granted , captain .
here we go .
i think that door just sighed .
ghastly , isn' t it ?
all the doors have been programmed to have a cheerful and sunny disposition .
anyway , come on .
i' ve been ordered to take you up to the bridge .
please yourselves .
here i am , brain the size of a planet , and they ask me to take you up to the bridge .
call that job satisfaction ?
' cause i don' t .
you can thank the sirius cybernetics corp. for building robots with g. p. p.
what' s g. p. p. ?
genuine people personalities .
i' m a personality prototype .
you can tell , can' t you ?
arthur ?
hey , slim , are you wearing my underwear ?
' cause i' m wearing yours .
and they ain' t doing the trick .
come on .
all right .
oh , for heaven' s sake .
i' ve brought the aliens .
don' t thank me or anything .
ah ha !
ow !
freeze !
freeze ?
i' m a robot .
not a refrigerator .
i wasn' t talking to you , giggles .
oh , why do i bother ?
zaphod ?
ford !
is that you ?
ford !
praxibetel lx !
what the hell are you doing here ?
i just stuck out my thumb and here i am .
that is so you .
look at you !
president of the galaxy .
i can' t believe you beat humma kavula .
you zarkin ' frood .
i want you to meet a friend .
arthur , this is zaphod beeblebrox .
oh .
president of the galaxy .
this is my cousin .
he' s a semi half brother ...
we share three of the same mothers .
we' ve met .
have we ?
i' m sorry .
i' ve got a terrible memory for species .
this is him , ford .
the would you like to see my spaceship bloke .
hmm .
yeah .
hello , arthur .
tricia !
how you doin ' ?
hey , trillian .
this is my semi half brother lx , i' m sorry , ford .
hi .
hi .
um , would you excuse us for a second , please ?
you went down on that little planet and didn' t call me ?
sorry , i didn' t know .
i had a galaxy to run .
hi , tricia mcmillan , right ?
i think he called you trillian .
which of us got the right one ?
i shortened it .
something a little more spacey .
right .
i was thinking of changing mine to ,
i don' t know , arthoolia .
that' s a good one .
well , this is weird .
how' d you get here ?
i just stuck out my thumb .
right .
in your pajamas ?
i was in a hurry .
okay .
did you know i was here ?
don' t flatter yourself .
i' ve got a spaceman too .
yeah , that' s kinda like the dingo shuffle , yeah .
okay , um , look .
i left you at the party .
i feel bad , but i was gonna call you when i got back .
well , there is no going back now , is there ?
you do know what happened ?
enough small talk .
we' re on the run , remember ?
excuse me , we' re having a chat .
well , i think the girl' s getting ...
boo !
you blew it with her , earthman , so shut your face or i' il kick you in the zatch .
you wanna fight ?
okay .
no .
no .
i' m just kidding .
i' m a kidder .
let' s be friends .
let' s connect .
you and l .
didn' t see that one coming , did you ?
popped right out of the box .
you foxy , yeah !
teach your pal a lesson , ford .
he' s a guest on my ship .
he' s a guest on my ship !
i thought you said you stole it .
stole what ?
what are we talking about ?
whoa !
that doesn' t sound good .
are you okay ?
just fabulous , thanks , " trill " .
a little help over here .
i' m in over my head .
i' il take care of this .
good zarquon , do i have to do everyhing ?
yes , i do !
hey , this is really pretty .
don' t !
whoo !
they' re on our tail .
fire a gun .
launch a missile .
do some damage !
ow !
stop that !
ow !
just kiddin ' .
i love it rough .
hit me .
uh , computer ?
hi , there .
i' m eddie , your computer .
i' m pleased to report that it' s a fleet of 100 vogon battle destroyers .
they' re sending you a message .
this is vice president questular rontok .
i am speaking to the kidnapper of the president ?
she digs me .
surrender the stolen vessel at once or we will take action as defined and permitted by ... section 1 8 of the galactic interstellar space bylaws ...
zaphod , please come back now .
this is ridiculous .
leap to hyperspace !
come on !
sure thing , fella !
no .
did they have proper hyperspace authorization ?
no , commander .
oh .
bring me the request to pursue fugitive forms .
i' m coming , sir .
i' m boiling !
oh , oh .
here' s the form , sir .
so are you along for the ride or am i just dropping you somewhere ?
that depends .
where are you going ?
where am i going ?
you okay ?
yeah .
don' t suppose there' s any tea .
yes , there is .
come on .
i' il show you the kitchen .
when you see what i' m about to show you , you' il beg me to take you with us .
the best drink in existence is the pan galactic gargle blaster , the effect of which is like having your brains smashed out by a slice of lemon wrapped round a large gold brick .
belgium .
hold it one second .
belgium .
ape man , earth dude , sorry , what' s your name again ?
arthur .
right .
gorgeous .
no hard feelings , okay ?
sorry to hear about your planet ...
earth .
yeah .
i liked earth .
got these boots there .
but don' t mention it to the girl .
because if you do ...
i' il pull your spleen out through your throat .
all right .
thanks , buddy .
okay .
good stuff .
like those jammies .
hey , hey , zaphod , what' s with the two head thing ?
oh , yeah .
apparently , you can' t be president with a whole brain .
it' s crazy .
oh , so you carved it up ?
yes .
parts of my personality weren' t exactly what you' d call presidential .
you know what i' m talkin ' about .
your tea is ready .
i suppose i should' ve said it resembles tea .
so , two heads is what does it for a girl ?
i mean , if i' d had two heads , or three ...
or your own spaceship .
anything else he' s got two of ?
come on , arthur , don' t be like that .
what am i supposed to be like ?
green ?
bleeping ?
i can fold my eyelids inside out if you like .
okay , look .
do you see this ?
this detects what you' re craving and makes it for you .
enjoy your doughnut .
do you see this ?
this toasts bread while you' re slicing it .
we' re on a spaceship , arthur .
in space .
i told you i wanted to get away .
to madagascar .
that was ... some sort of test .
and i failed .
how badly does it hurt ?
it doesn' t feel great .
no , i mean your chin .
ah ...
i might have an aspirin .
right .
hey !
tricia ...
trillian , sorry .
there' s something i have to tell you .
please , don' t .
showtime , trill .
i' m going to set up .
buttons aren' t toys .
buttons aren' t toys .
anyway ...
when i saw what i' m about to show you , that' s when i realized why i had to do what i did to my brain .
i think .
it' s all a little ... ... shaky .
i' ve seen it .
it' s rubbish .
i' ve seen it .
it' s rubbish .
many millions of years ago , a race of hyperintelligent , pan dimensional beings got so fed up with the constant bickering about the meaning of life , that they commissioned two of their brightest and best to design and build a stupendous super computer to calculate the answer to life , the universe and everything .
o deep thought , we want you to tell us the answer .
the answer to what ?
the answer to life , the universe , everyhing .
we' d really like an answer .
something simple .
hmm , i' d have to think about that .
return to this place in exactly seven and a half million years .
is it finished ?
no , there' s more .
they go back .
seven and a half million years later ?
that' s right , they do .
deep thought , do you have ...
an answer for you ?
yes , but you' re not going to like it .
it doesn' t matter .
we must know it .
all right .
the answer to the ultimate question ... [ cheering ]
... of life , the universe and everything ... [ cheering ]
... is ... [ cheering ]
... 42 .
yeah ?
what ?
42 ?
yes , i thought it over quite thoroughly .
it' s 42 .
it would' ve been simpler to have known what the question was .
but it was the question .
the ultimate question .
of everyhing !
that' s not a question .
only when you know the question will you know what the answer means .
give us the ultimate question then .
i can' t .
but there is one who can .
a computer that will calculate the ultimate question .
a computer of such infinite complexity , that life itself will form part of its operational matrix .
and you yourselves shall take on new , more primitive forms , and go down into the computer to navigate its 1 0 million year program .
i shall design this computer for you , and it shall be called ...
that' s it ?
that' s it .
you' re looking for the ultimate question ?
you ?
why ?
i tried that .
why ?
42 .
doesn' t work .
let' s get it ready , baby .
why ... ... do you want to know the ultimate question ?
partly curiosity , partly a sense of adventure , but , uh , mostly i think it' s for the fame and the money .
you' re president of the galaxy .
yes , arman .
arthur .
whatever .
presidential fame is temporary .
i find the question , that' s permanent .
it sticks .
plus , everyone thinks you' re deep .
win win .
we just hit that button and bam , we' re at magrathea , i think .
we' ve hit it twice and we' re still not there , but anyway ...
you in ?
always .
all right !
uh , i want to get off .
uh , sorry , what exactly are we doing ?
this !
the infinite improbability drive is a wonderful new method of crossing interstellar distances in a few seconds , without all that tedious mucking about in hyperspace .
as the improbability drive reaches infinite improbability , it passes through every conceivable point in every conceivable universe almost simultaneously .
so you' re never sure where you' il end up or even what species you' il be when you get there .
it' s therefore important to dress accordingly .
the drive was invented following research into finite improbability often used to break the ice at parties by making all the molecules in the hostess ' s undergarments
ieap one foot to the left in accordance with the theory of indeterminacy .
many physicists said they wouldn ' t stand for that sort of thing , partly because it debased science , but mostly because they didn ' t get invited to those sort of parties .
wow , is this gonna happen every time we hit that button ?
very probably , yes .
ah , i think the earthman' s about to be sick .
in the trashcan , ape man .
this ship' s new .
aw , come on !
we have normality .
did it work ?
are we there ?
yeah .
we' re here .
magrathea !
i don' t think so .
eddie ...
ow !
what planet is this ?
i' m checking for you .
did you just pluck one of my hairs ?
off my head ?
thank you for waiting .
sorry to disappoint , but this is not magrathea .
we are currently in orbit around the planet viltvodle six .
humma kavula !
magrathea' s gonna have to wait .
i got a score to settle on this planet .
humma kavula !
in the beginning , the universe was created .
this made a lot of people very angry , and is widely regarded as a bad move .
many races believed it was created by some sort of god , though the jatravartid people of viltvodle six firmly believe that the entire universe was sneezed out of the nose of a being called the great green arkleseizure .
humma kavula !
the jatravartids , who lived in fear of the time they called the coming of the great white handkerchief , were small blue creatures with more than 50 arms each .
they were unique in being the only race in history to have invented the aerosol deodorant before the wheel .
mr president !
hey , all right .
how you doin ' ?
hey , what have we here ?
i love it !
hey , i love you .
fantastic !
you guys related ?
don' t go changing .
arthur , i want a drink .
i think i' ve been here before .
have i been here before ?
i' ve been here before .
humma kavula !
come on .
tricia !
tricia , i ...
hello , humma .
join us .
sit down .
good to see you .
thanks .
all right .
the handkerchief is coming .
let us pray the almighty will exhale a breath of compassion on us all .
so that' s humma kavula .
i thought he was just swearing .
we lift our noses , clogged and unblown , in reverence to you .
send the handkerchief , o blessed one , so that it may wipe us clean .
we ask this and all things in thy precious and alliterative name .
bless you .
we goin ' in here ?
all right , i like it .
it' s big , it' s gold , it' s fancy .
fancy pants .
zaphod beeblebrox , our infamous president .
what brings you to our humble planet ?
oh , i think you know why i' m here .
no , i don' t think i do .
i think you think you don' t .
but we both know ... you do .
eloquent as always .
your ability to articulate never ceases to amaze .
that' s funny .
during the campaign , humma , when you were my opponent running against me , you said i was stupid .
the election is ancient history , zaphod , but ... ... if memory serves , you won , proving that good looks and charm win over brilliance and the ability to govern .
and , incidentally , you are stupid .
excuse me , mr humma , sir .
uh , i just want to say , there' s been some sort of terrible mix up
' cause , actually , he' s not with us .
we came to worship you .
he followed us and ...
he grew , didn' t he .
he' s not that tall .
you didn' t come half way across the galaxy to settle a campaign grudge .
why are you here ?
of course not , that' s , that' s ridiculous .
i' ve been stranded on a strange planet for years , i haven' t been avoiding you .
you look great .
you' re doing well .
you' ve grown , obviously .
aggh !
oomph !
wait !
we don' t know why we' re here .
we were trying to get to magrathea and our ship brought us here .
how very , very improbable .
i kept a few souvenirs from my former life .
ah , the heady days of space piracy .
but ... even an lnfinite lmprobability drive requires coordinates .
which i happen to have .
no , no , no .
you don' t get something for nothing , zaphod .
you must bring me something in return .
wh ...
what ?
a gun .
a gun ?
a very special gun .
designed by the greatest computer ever invented .
but the only way to find it is to go to magrathea .
fine .
i' il get your gun .
just give me the coordinates .
and what will you give me to ensure your return ?
my word as president .
no .
i need a hostage .
only ... what does zaphod beeblebrox treasure ?
come on .
oh , no !
hey , take it easy now .
no , stop it .
ah !
oh , that kind of tickles .
two heads are better than one .
double your pleasure .
you need me !
come back !
come back !
don' t leave me alone .
come back !
i thought i alone considered your boyfriend a narcissistic moron , but the whole galaxy does .
what about you ?
excuse me , mr humma , sir .
we' re not with him .
we just came to worship you . " very brave .
where the hell is ford ?
by the left , march .
left , right , left , right .
mr president , we' re here for your protection .
fire upon the kidnapper !
hey , come on !
the president is the kidnapper .
you' il kill him !
bang !
bang !
it' s locked !
thank you , darling .
i' il be in touch .
come on , zaphod .
hey , what did i miss ?
what have you been doing ?
field research .
so they found where we are ?
belgium bummer !
they' re shooting at us !
what are we going to do ?
i have an idea .
pushing him out and running away ?
what ?
he' s the one they want .
you can' t go out there .
what are you doing ?
back off !
what' s going on ?
i have the president and i will kill him , i swear .
could that actually kill him ?
i don' t think so .
it' s an aerosol can .
oh .
okay , frightened now , frightened .
hi , little guy .
get her !
zaphod , no , come on !
arthur !
arthur !
tricia !
arthur !
tricia !

where' s the circus ?
they got her and it' s my fault .
we have to go !
let' s go !
whoo !
computer , take us to magrathea !
what ?
no , no , no .
we' ve got to go after tricia .
who ?
trillian .
they' ve got trillian , you stupid half brained git !
right , you' re coming out !
computer , we don' t want to go to magrathea , we want to follow the ships .
i' d love to , but my guidance system has been deactivated .
oh , come on !
i' m sorry .
it wasn' t my fault .
what you doing on this ship ?
ford ?
marvin .
i' ve been talking to the ship' s computer .
and ?
it hates me .
no , uh uh .
eddie , computer , is there another way to follow the ships ?
activating emergency escape pod .
it' s super neat and fun to fly !
ow !
unbelievable !
i' m in .
i' m in .
okay , ford , do you have any idea ?
we' il press this .
oh , no , no , no , no .
this button .
okay .
nothing' s ...
okay !
good man , good man , good man .
okay , we' re wobbling ...
you forgot your towel .
get him off me !
i' il kill him !
okay , ford , there' s a ...
is that better ?
no , that' s worse , that' s worse .
do what ...
i don' t need that .
okay .
stop the rocking .
marvin , any ideas ?
i have a million ideas .
they all point to certain death .
thanks , marv .
ooh , ooh .
eee .
ooh , ooh .
whoo !
whee !
whee !
yeah !
yeah !
magrathea !
no , we' re on the vogon planet .
yes , it is .
it' s magrathea !
this is vogsphere .
yeah , magrathea .
i know it .
no , it' s not .
there is no magrathea .
yes , it is .
what are you doing ?
they took my head .
they have these on arcturan megafreighters .
they use them when they need to concentrate .
what is it ?
it' s a thinking cap .
there you go .
should give him some zest for about ten minutes or so .
now i' m feeling much better about our predicament .
i checked the guide for how to rescue a prisoner from vogsphere .
it said don' t .
i' m assuming you have a better plan .
well , i kind of had this idea that we could ...
ow !
did anyone see that ?
see what ?
what was it ?
uh ...
nothing , it' s , uh , nothing .
it' s just my imagination .
okay , right .
now , everyone just stop a minute , please , and look at me .
there' s ... definitely something going on here .
just ... just watch .
just watch .
okay , i think we ...
oooh !
ah ha !
you too !
yeah , what was that ?
i thi ...
zaphod , what do you think ?
i think ...
ow !
zarquon !
what was that ?
jeez !
i' d make a suggestion , but you wouldn' t listen .
no one ever does .
i have an idea .
ooh , ooh , ooh , ford !
kill it !
get rid of it !
okay , don' t think .
nobody think .
no ideas .
no theories .
no nothing .
ow !
this is crazy .
trillian is in there somewhere .
we need an idea to save her .
i have an ide ...
ah !
run !
yeeaaghh !
ooh !
ah !
you' re supposed to stop .
okay , so i' m not thinking .
not thinking .
no ideas coming .
okay , this isn' t an idea that has any merit at all , but , marvin , can you give me a hand ?
okay , where is she ? !
who , the director of robot arm repair ?
tricia yggarstuk mcmillanus of ...
blaard ?
no , tricia marie mcmillan of earth .
oh .
right .
sorry , no record of earth .
galactic sector zz9 plural z alpha ?
oh , yes .
she' s lying .
she' s skinny , and she' s pretty , and she' s lying .
mmmm .
here we are .
earth .
oh .
um , " destroyed .
um , do you have a second home planet ?
destroyed ?
that' s impossible .
that' s what it says here .
says it was destroyed to make way for a hyperspace expressway .
who in their right mind gives an order to destroy a planet ?
he said the gray building , right ?
all the buildings are gray .
give me a hand . " ha ha , very funny .
how am i supposed to drive this pod with one arm ?
stupid human .
go and fill that in .
then , make sure , when you fill in the facilitating form ...
leave this to me .
i' m british .
i know how to queue .
if you' d fill that form in for me , and return it as soon as possible .
writing implements to your left ...
you' re president .
can you do anything ?
presidents don' t have power .
their job is to draw attention away from it .
hey , how you doin ' ?
hey , it' s me , your president !
what' s goin ' on ?
thanks for coming .
all right .
i know that sponge .
all right !
next !
president coming through .
how you doin ' , pinhead ?
no , really , it' s me .
i love kabuki .
look at that .
out the way .
give us a kiss !
hi , i' ve come about release of a prisoner .
prisoner release form .
oh , wha ... ?
i don' t believe you .
these are the orders .
love and kisses " ? !
mm .
now , according to the galactic penal code , the punishment for a presidential kidnapping is to be fed to the ravenous bugblatter beast of traal .
good day .
ow , get off of me !
ow !
what the hell is that ?
ow , no , wait , wait !
there' s been some kind of mistake .
ah !
tick all the boxes on the right .
right .
got it .
not that one !
what to do if you find yourself stuck with no hope of rescue .
consider how lucky you are that life has been good to you so far .
alternatively , if life hasn ' t been good to you so far , which , given your current circumstances seems more likely , consider how lucky you are that it won ' t be troubling you much longer .
right , there we go .
oh , kidnapping the president .
oh , no , she' s not eligible for release at this time .
okay .
right .
look , this is the president .
oh !
okay .
see , there ?
he says the kidnapping business was a horrible misunderstanding .
oh , yeah .
she meant nothing by it .
he' s ordering you to let her go .
but this isn' t a presidential release of prisoner form .
those are blue .
i' il stay here .
all right .
hold that .
okay .
wai ...
oh , he' s hungry today .
that' s blue .
right .
i' m not a journalist .
we' re just hanging out .
okay , this is , uh , it' s for tricia mcmillan .
tricia mcmillan .
mm .
okay .
sir , it' s a release form .
thank you .
she' s free to go .
release her .
zaphod' s here .
well , then , uh , that' s fine then .
let' s just go and get him .
who are we waiting for again ?
no , i' m serious .
tricia !
tricia .
trill .
hey , come on .
you idiot !
you signed the order to destroy earth .
he did ?
i did ?
yes .
love and kisses , zaphod " ?
you didn' t even read it , did you ?
honey , i' m president of the galaxy .
i don' t get a lot of time for reading .
an entire planet , my home , destroyed because you thought they wanted your autograph .
they framed me !
are you an idiot ?
trillian .
you knew .
why didn' t you tell me ?
he threatened me .
get a backbone , arthur .
oh , a backbone ?
what about coming here to rescue you ?
thank you .
my idea .
oh !
stupid !
got your arm .
how considerate .
right , then , all those lucky enough to have two arms , hold tight .
oh , the president tests my patience .
this time i shall pursue him myself .
ready my ship .
fantastic .
at last .
oh .
that' s one hour for lunch , everybody .
i think i' il have soup today .
the encyclopedia galactica , in its chapter on love , states that it is far too complicated to define .
the hitchhiker' s guide to the galaxy has this to say on love .
avoid , if at all possible .
unfortunately , arthur dent has never read
the hitchhiker' s guide to the galaxy .
oh , i' m so sorry .
no , come in .
i ...
i didn' t ...
um , look , uh ...
trillian , i just wanted to say , you were right ,
i should' ve told you , and i understand totally if you' re angry with me .
um , for what it' s worth , i know how you must be feeling ...
can you hand me a towel ?
yeah , sure , this ...
thank you .
actually , what i was going to say was ... ... if i' d said yes to you and gone to madagascar , then neither of us would be here now .
i just thought that might count for something .
it doesn' t matter .
all right , computer , take us to ...
where are we ...
where we headed again ?
okay , i' m gonna get you another lemon .
all right .
engaging improbability drive .
no , zaphod , no .
buttons are not toys .
what did you do ?
magrathean coordinates accepted .
it blows my circuits to tell you that we' re in orbit , at an altitude of 300 miles , around the legendary planet of magrathea .
magrathea !
magrathea !
magrathea !
unbelievable .
it' s even worse than i thought it would be .
greetings .
this is a recorded announcement as we are all out .
the commercial council of magrathea thanks you for your visit , but regrets that the entire planet is temporarily closed .
if you' d like to leave your name and a planet where you can be contacted , kindly do so at the tone .
how can a planet be closed ?
zarkin ' a , cousin .
okay , computer , keep going .
t ake us down .
i' d be happy to .
it is gratifying that your enthusiasm for our planet continues unabated .
as a token of our appreciation , we hope you will enjoy the two thermo nuclear missiles we' ve just sent to converge with your craft .
to ensure on going quality of service , your death may be monitored for training purposes .
thank you .
i' m delighted to tell you there are two nuclear missiles heading right for us .
if you don ' t mind , i' m going to take evasive action .
something ' s jamming my guidance system .
impact minus 45 seconds .
computer , do something !
sure .
handing over manual control .
good luck .
i need some help .
i can' t do this without my third arm .
arthur , grab my hand !
did we lose ' em ?
no , they' re coming right at us .
why don' t i just press this ?
no , we' re not back to normal yet .
what will happen ?
i don' t know .
don' t do it !
we' re here .
no telling where it' il send us .
sod it all .
no !
wow .
where are we ?
exactly where we were .
and the missiles ?
apparently , they' ve turned ... into a bowl of petunias .
and a very surprised looking whale .
and an improbability factor of 8 , 767 , 1 28 to 1 against .
we have norm ... normality .
normality , right .
we can talk about normality till the cows come home .
what is normal ?
what' s home ?
what are cows ?
a proper cup of tea would restore my normality .
it is important to note that suddenly , and against all probability , a sperm whale had been called into existence several miles above the surface of an alien planet .
since this is not a tenable position for a whale , this innocent creature had very little time to come to terms with its identity .
ah , whoa , what' s happening ?
who am i ?
why am i here ?
what' s my purpose ?
what do i mean by who am i ?
okay , okay , calm down , get a grip now .
ooh , this is an interesting sensation .
a sort of tingling in my ...
i better start finding names for things .
let' s call it a tail .
yeah , tail .
what' s this roaring sound whooshing past what i' m gonna call my head ?
wind .
is that a good name ?
that' il do .
yay , this is really exciting .
i' m dizzy with anticipation .
or is it the wind ?
there' s a lot of that now .
and what' s this thing coming towards me very fast ?
so big and flat and round .
it needs a big wide sounding name like ow , ound , round , ground !
that' s it , ground .
i wonder if it will be friends with me .
hello , ground .
the only thing that went through the mind of the bowl of petunias as it fell was , " oh , no , not again !
many have speculated that if we knew why the petunias had thought that , we should know a lot more about the nature of the universe than we do now .
what are those things ?
they' re portals to another dimension .
right .
i don' t suppose this portal has central heating , does it ?
ah , this is the one .
this will all end in tears , i just know it .
right here .
hey !
whoa !
okay , in we go !
we can' t just step into that ... that !
we don' t know where it leads .
if we pick the wrong one , we just ... we come back , we pick another one .
it' s no biggie .
what ?
yeah , it' s a big biggie , ford .
a big biggie .
what if it rips us all into tiny little atomic particle thingies ?
this is the right one .
i have a hunch .
ford !
his hunches are good .
arthur , i say we go .
go with the hunch of a man whose brain is fuelled by lemons ? !
this is suicide !
i think i resent that .
i don' t care .
i' m getting hostility from you , alex ...
arthur !
have you ever tried yoga ?
trillian !
i think that' s supposed to happen .
she' s gone !
ford , she' s gone !
arthur , don' t panic !
ford !
hey , wait for me !
whoo !
come on .
idiot !
come on , come on , come on , come on !
ahhh !
no , no , no , don' t leave .
come on , come on , just start !
i told you this would end in tears .
did you ?
did you ?
geronimo !
ooomph !
far out !
far out !
ha ha !
this is it .
this is it !
deep thought .
i' m a coming .
so , this is how it' s all going to end , is it ?
me , alone on a dead planet , with a manically depressed robot .
you think you' ve got problems .
what if you are a manically depressed robot ?
excuse me .
aaaaagghhh !
whoa , whoa .
who are you ?
no , uh , my name is not important .
uh , you must come with me .
get away .
terrible events are afoot .
um , you ... you must come or you' il be late .
late ?
what for ?
what ?
no , no .
what' s ... what' s your name , earthman ?
dent .
arthur dent .
well ...
iate as in " the late dentarthurdent .
it' s a sort of threat , do you see ?
no .
no .
your friends are safe .
you can trust me .
a man who won' t tell me his name ?
okay , my name is , um ... ... my name is ... is ... is ...
slartibartfast .
i ...
i ...
i said it wasn' t important .
well ... so my friends are safe ?
let me show you .
i could calculate your chances of survival , but you won' t like it .
did you know we built planets ?
oh , yes , fascinating trade .
doing the , um ... doing the coastlines was always my favorite .
we used to have endless fun doing the little fiddly bits around the fjords .
but then the galactic economy collapsed , and seeing that custom built planets are a ... are a bit of a luxury commodity ...
come with me because there' s been a terrible mix up with your planet .
best laid plans of mice , you know .
and men .
what ?
best laid plans of mice and men .
yes , well , i don' t think men have much to do with it .
here .
um , i must warn you , we' re going to pass through , well , a sort of gateway thing .
huh ?
it may disturb you .
it scares the willies out of me .
aghh !
aghh !
ha , ha , ha .
welcome to our factory floor .
okay .
all right .
all right .
yeah , this is it .
this is it .
o great deep thought !
we have traveled long ... ... and far .
have you calculated the ultimate question of life , the universe and everyhing ?
no .
what ?
i' ve been watching tv .
oh .
i designed another computer to do that .
oh , right , i forgot .
is it here ?
no , it' s not here .
it' s another world .
it' s on another world .
it is another world , stupid .
or it was until the vogons destroyed it to make way for a hyperspace expressway .
well ...
okay .
you sure you don' t have the question , or a way to , you know , access it or something ?
' cause i think i' ve done a lot to get here .
oh , shh , shh .
the show' s back on .
well , i don' t wanna bother you , so i' m gonna ...
good stuff .
great .
i' m gonna go and find something else for my entire life to be about .
zaphod , zaphod , there' s the ... the gun .
gun ?
that humma sent you for .
you gave him your head .
why' d i ...
why' d i do that ?
okay .
that' s stupid .
o deep thought , we were told that there is a gun .
there you are .
hm ?
look familiar ?
so it wasn' t destroyed ?
actually , it was .
this is a backup .
earth mark ll .
so you ... you made the earth ?
not me alone , but i ...
i did my part .
ever heard of a place , i think it' s called norway ?
that was one of mine .
i ...
i got an award for it .
oh , hoo !
all right , frank ?
that' s ... that' s frank .
ah ha .
they ... they' ve nearly finished the oceans .
zaphod .
here , it' s ... ... it' s just like humma said .
now you can go get your head back .
hey , ford .
it' s been nice knowing you , you zarking frood .
no !
whoa !
this is a bust too .
h ...
h ...
hey , man .
you know , you must really be frustrated .
you go through all you have , you don' t get an answer , which means no money or fame , which you deserve ...
the point of view gun , conveniently , does precisely what its name suggests .
fantastic .
fantastic .
fantastic .
if you point it at someone and pull the trigger , they instantly see things from your point of view .
give me that thing .
it was designed by deep thought , but commissioned by a consortium of intergalactic angry housewives who , after arguments with their husbands , were sick of ending those arguments with the phrase ,
you just don' t get it , do you ?
uh , uh , and you' re right , i shouldn' t be so upset because life goes on , you know , and i should just go on with it .
shoot him again .
whoa .
hitchhiking' s good .
towels are good too .
say what ?
that is brilliant .
what' s goin ' ... ?
i can see why humma kavula would want one of these .
we better get back .
arthur' s waiting .
who cares ?
i do .
especially since we' re somewhat of an endangered species , thanks to you .
why so edgy , baby doll ?
relax .
you wanna know why i' m edgy ?
argh .
of course you' re edgy .
your planet' s been blown up and you' ve been tooling around with the guy who signed the order .
huh ?
ugh !
you actually wanted to know the question because you always wondered if there was more to life and now you' re crushed because you find out there really isn' t .
hey , fantastic .
psychedelic .
you' ve got no home , no family , and you' re stuck with me , another in a long line of men who doesn' t really get you .
huh ?
that' s not true .
and you' re worried you might have blown it with the one guy who really does .
hey , whoops .
oh , baby doll .
give me that thing .
it won' t affect me .
i' m already a woman .
it' s okay .
it' s only a couple of little mice !
voila !
himalayas .
good , eh ?
earthman , you must realize that the planet you lived on was commissioned , paid for and run by mice .
when you say mice , do you mean the little furry white creatures with whiskers , ears , cheese ?
yeah , but they' re protrusions into our dimension of hyperintelligent beings .
i don' t know this cheese of which you speak , but they were there on earth as mice experimenting on you .
i see where you' ve become confused now .
you see , we were experimenting on them .
ah , no , well , yeah , no .
that' s what they wanted you to think , but you were actually elements in their computer program .
actually , this explains a lot .
all my life , i' ve had this strange feeling there' s something big and sinister going on in the world .
no , that' s normal paranoia .
everyone in the universe gets that .
perhaps i' m old and tired , but the chances of finding out what' s actually going on are so absurdly remote that the only thing to do is say hang the sense of it and keep yourself busy .
i' d much rather be happy than right any day .
and are you ?
uh ... no .
that' s where it all falls down , of course .
here you are then .
is this ... ?
it' s , um ...
it' s all there .
you know , it all works .
welcome home .
hey !
hey , man !
there you are !
surprise !
what are you doing ?
what happened to you ?
is that tea ?
first , our hosts attacked us .
right .
but then they made up for it by making us ... [ tearfully ] ... this amazing meal .
it' s so ...
everyhing' s right .
everyhing' s delicious .
oh , come on , that' s lovely .
we' re glad you like it , earth creature .
the , um , talking ... talking mice .
cool .
sit , earthman .
oh , thank you .
thank you for that .
please , drink .
um , uh , excuse me .
uh , is there anything else ?
no , we' re quite happy , thank you .
um , good , i' il be outside , so ...
you were right .
please , drink .
yes .
he was right .
now , to business .
to business !
eat !
shh .
sorry .
we' ve spent a lot of time on your planet
iooking for this ultimate question .
only to have it blow up in our faces .
literally .
which is why you' re here .
we' ve been offered a lucrative contract to do several 5 d tv chat shows .
but here' s the point .
we must have product .
we need the ultimate question , or one that sounds ultimate .
of course .
we' ve rebuilt the planet .
now all we need is the missing piece of the puzzle .
which happens to be your brain .
right .
more tea ?
sorry , did you just say you need my brain ?
yes , to complete the program .
you can' t have my brain .
i' m using it .
hardly .
hardly ?
cheeky ...
cheeky mouse .
zaphod !
trillian !
ford .
what was in that food ?
what was in my tea ?
don' t worry .
you won' t feel a thing .
just wait a sodding minute .
you want a question that goes with the answer 42 ?
what about , what' s 6x7 ?
or , um , uh , how many vogons does it take to change a light bulb ?
here' s one : how many roads must a man walk down ?
hey , that' s not bad .
fine .
fine , take it , ' cause my head is filled with questions , and no answer to any one of them has ever brought me one iota of happiness .
except for one .
the one .
the only question i' ve ever wanted an answer to .
is she the one ?
the answer bloody well isn' t 42 , it' s yes .
undoubtedly , unequivocally , unabashedly , yes .
and for one week , one week in my sad little ... blip of an existence ... ... it made me happy .
that' s a good answer .
we don' t want to be happy .
we want to be famous .
what' s this " ls she the one " tripe ?
take his brain !
no , don' t take the brain !
don' t take the brain , mice !
it wasn' t me !
i' m famous .

let' s go somewhere .
definitely .
where did you have in mind ?
i know this great restaurant at the end of the universe .
i am a little peckish .
i need to go to humma' s .
he' s got something of mine .
i think .
i' m so confused .
don' t worry , baby .
we' il sort it out .
all right , let' s trip the light fantastic , baby .
just you and me .
come on .
you got your towel ?
yeah .
why ?
am i going to need it ?
only always .
right .
yeah .
i wouldn' t want to go anywhere without my wonderful towel .
okay .
hold tight .
stand by for commencement of life cycle .
in three , two , one ...
all right !
whoo !
not that anyone cares what i say , but the restaurant is at the other end of the universe .
yeah !
play it !
it is , of course , well known that careless talk costs lives .
but the full scale of the problem is not always appreciated .
for instance , at the very moment that arthur dent said ,
i wouldn' t want to go anywhere without my wonderful towel " a freak wormhole opened up in the fabric of the space time continuum and carried his words far , far back in time , across almost infinite reaches of space , to a distant galaxy where strange and warlike beings were poised on the brink of frightful interstellar battle .
the two opposing leaders , resplendent in their black jeweled battle shorts were meeting for the last time , when a dreadful silence fell .
and at that very moment , the words " i wouldn ' t want to go anywhere without my wonderful towel " drifted across the conference table .
unfortunately , in their native tongue , this was the most appalling insult imaginable .
so the opposing battle fleets decided to settle their remaining differences , in order to launch a joint attack on our galaxy , now positively identified as the source of the offending remark .
for thousands of years , the mighty starships tore across the empty wastes of space and finally dived screaming onto the planet earth , where , due to a terrible miscalculation of scale , the entire battle fleet was accidentally swallowed by a small dog .
those who study the complex interplay of cause and effect in the history of the universe , say that this sort of thing is going on all the time .
