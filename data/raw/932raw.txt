i' m the uptight lawyer ... but you were always the crazy one in the family .
i know .
relax and have fun .
my bachelor party ... was the last good time in my marriage .
maybe your marriage didn' t work ... because you had too much fun at the bachelor party .
it didn' t work because deena was impossible to please .
your marriage will be fine .
you' ve got karen .

smart .
funny .
she' s kind to animals .
she' s very , very sexy .
she' s got a great sense of style .

it' s really such an outdated ritual .
you are every mother in law' s dream .
can you put karen on for me ?
sure .
hold on .
oh , my god .
what is it ?
is something the matter ?
i guess karen hasn' t arrived yet .
what do you mean ?
she' s on her way over .
she should be there by now .

sandra , i have to get going .

good morning to you , too .
i' m not a rude guy , but you have to go now !

my fiancee is on her way over here .
you' re getting married ?
only if you leave really , really soon .
you weren' t the guy with the groom hat on .
i' d love to explain , but you have to leave .
i' m going to get my ass kicked .
that is very clear .
what happened ?
ok , let' s go .
bad news .
i can' t find my underwear .
can i mail them to you ?
yes , please .
they' re my only pair .
give me your address .
i have more than one pair of underwear .
i' il find them before she gets here .
calm down .
if you' re freaking out ... when your fiancee gets here , you' il freak her out .
you' re freaking me out , and i don' t even know you .
just be cool .
i' m a very cool guy .
cooler than most of the guys you probably meet .
no offense .
this is just a bad situation for me .
trust me .
i' m not this guy .
after you .
if you see a pair of bikini underwear lying around ... see this guy .
could you not say that , please ?
can you do me a favor and take the back stairs ?
in case i had any speck of self esteem left ?
i bet that goes over well with the ladies .
there are no ladies , all right ?
right .
it' s actually ...
thank you , mrs. jackson .
aloha .
wedding planner .

paul !
what' s going on ?
please undo the chain .
i am standing out here .
paul , are you ok ?
karen , sweetheart , what a surprise .
why' d you chain the door shut ?
you can' t be too safe .
how was the bachelor party ?
hung over ?
not at all .
i know what happens at these things ... and you should not feel guilty ... and you don' t have to tell me anything .
unless there' s something you want to tell me .
don' t leave !
let me explain !
shut up !
maybe i had a drink or two .
yeah .
i' m sure you kept it to two .
ok , look .
i got all your outfits for the parties this week .
this ...
wow .
that' s a nice sweater .
and you like ?

i thought it would be perfect for the rehearsal dinner .
perfect .
i knew you' d like it .
how is the string quartet coming along ?
i' m on it .
it is the one thing ...
i have asked you to do for this wedding .
yeah .
it' s basically almost completely ...
taken care of .
how was the bachelorette party ?
oh , my god .
a total blast .
we went to giggles , and sat in front ... and heckled the comedians .
jody got so wasted !
hello ?
earth to paul .
over here , you big party animal .
how about a kiss for that hangover ?
all right .
what are you ...
what are you ...
ok .
i have a million things to do .
my great aunt budge is coming in tomorrow .
my mom is completely freaked out .
your mom called ... this morning .
she did ?
did she tell you i was coming over ?
then why were you so surprised to see me ?
i might be more hung over than i thought .
you' re a weirdo .
oh , my god .
i have a million things to do .
oh , god .
what the hell happened last night ?
where were you ?
sorry , chief .
i got waylaid .
if you know what i' m saying ... way laid .
what ?
that tiki girl tonya .
i kept trying to turn off the charm ... but i guess i couldn' t find the switch .
you' re not listening to me .
i woke up this morning with a strange woman in my bed .
how could this happen ?
was i that drunk ?
that' s awesome !
what are you complaining about ?
what ?
nice shoes .
karen got them .
she wants me to break them in .
they' re special .
move .
i got to tell karen .
paul , listen to me .
do not under any circumstances tell karen .
what happened last night is perfectly natural .
we' re men .
we' re hunters .
it' s encrypted in our dna code .
you got to accept that .
get over it .
i don' t know what i' m going to do .
hi , jim .
it' s tonya from last night .
i was going to be in the neighborhood later ... and thought i might stop by , so give me a call .
shit .
that poor girl' s been jim ified .
this is all your fault , man .
probably ... but karen' s never going to find out .
and that tiki girl ?
come on .
you' il never see her again .
a survey was made one time that covered a lot of men ... working men ... and these men were asked this question ...
why do you work ?
why do you get up in the morning ?
why ?
everyone goes to work in the morning .
and that' s the reason they do it ... because everyone else is doing it .
and there you have the trouble today .
it' s conformity ... people acting like everyone else without knowing why ... or where they' re going .
we' il have more with dr. earl ... after this short break on kcnp ... the best talk in seattle .
hi !
holy shit !
you work here ?
first day .
what happened to the dancing ?
i sucked .
hey !

i may be your bride to be' s father ... but i' m still a man .

i know what you' re thinking .
it' s the good life ...

boys , let' s get started .
i' ve been in this business a long time ... and if we get " modern rifleman " up to 750, 000 ...
i' il strip down to my shorts and jump in the ocean .
my question is ... once you' ve stripped down to your shorts ... will you actually loosen your tie ?

let' s get down to business .

yeah ?

pretty good , sir .
i' m projecting ...
why don' t you get up there and talk to us ?

ok ...
it' s a good news , bad news situation .
the good news is ... we' ve had steady growth over the last six months .
nice .

that' s where it starts , ernie !
how you doing ?

that' s a little disheartening .
no , no , no !
you did not sleep with her cousin .
i didn' t know she was her cousin .

when you have karen , who' s so stunning ... and witty and delectable ... and has those little dimples ...
pete .

next thanksgiving or christmas .
this saturday at your wedding ... after she' s had four gin and tonics ... and she steps up to the microphone ... and tells the whole world .
that' s not gonna happen .
everyone , your attention please .
i think you should know ...

that stuff' s too advanced .
you' re saying i' m not advanced ?

frankly , i' m not really sure it' s in this store .
really ?
when did you become the music expert ?
since tuesday , mr. shiny shoes .
wait .
look , i came by to ...
apologize for the other night .
and for never mentioning that you were marrying my cousin !
i didn' t know .
i' m sorry .
no , don' t apologize .
you were amazing .
well , thank you .
i don' t normally sleep with a girl and then ...
paul , right ?
the funny thing is we didn' t sleep together .
we slept together , but we didn' t sleep together .
we didn' t ?
so i' m not amazing ?
i couldn' t say .
but for the record , you were cute .
if things were different and you hadn' t passed out ... with your pants around your ankles , who knows ?
if we didn' t sleep together , how did i get crabs ?
you got crabs ?
you gave me crabs .
i do not have crabs !
you don' t have crabs ?
god , no .
but if i do get crabs ...
i will hunt you down and kill your crabby ass .
then how did i get them ?
i don' t know .
maybe a toilet seat ?
hey , paul !
congratulations , man .
yeah !
really , that happens ?
we saw it a lot in the lab .
the lab ?
long story .
she' s hot .
listen , i' m just hoping ...
we' il know each other for the rest of our lives ...
i won' t say anything .
you say that now , but what if ...
i' m not going to screw up what you and karen have .
you are perfect for each other .
that' s right .
we are .
why do you say that ?
god , you are exhausting .
buy this .
you' il like it .
trust me .
record store ?
i thought she was a tiki dancer .
she' s just so cocky , you know ?
i know music .
come on , i see bands .
why does she think she knows me ?
she doesn' t know anything about me .
i' m cool .
i wear on the edge clothing and hip stuff .
hang on .
hi , i' m jim .
ok .
what' s up with that clock ?
it still says 10 after 5 .
dude , that clock doesn' t work .
never has .
asshole !
yes , that' s it .
i' m sorry i' m late .
finally .
there was a lot of traffic .
this is our last lesson , and you are 45 minutes late .
look at everybody else .
they' re better than us .
all right , let' s go .
sorry .
i hope everybody noticed karen and paul .
they are a textbook example of what not to do .
karen , would you mind ?
this shouldn' t be a chore .
have fun out there .
let go .
enjoy yourself .
come on , howard .
this time , i' m karen , and i want to feel your joy ... as you fling me around that dance floor .
ok ?
ok .

i am your lady ... and you be my man .
karen , music please .

one , two , three ...
good , good .
very good .
that' s it .
watch the pretty lady as she dances around .
and yes , and yes .
that' s it .
we' re flying , paul .
can you feel it ?
everybody !
that' s it .
good .
that howard ... he is so damn graceful , isn' t he ?
he' s a dance instructor .
it' s his job .
i just mean , a guy with his frame ... you don' t see it coming , and then ... something magical happens out on that dance floor .
paul , seat belt .
people surprise you , is all i' m saying .
did you book the string quartet ?
i was thinking , maybe we should do ... something like a band .
string quartet ?
i don' t know if that' s really our thing .
a band , playing music we like .
it' s a little bit lighter ...
or we could stick with the string quartet .
jump out .
chop , chop .
i' il go find a spot .
great .
hey , lollipop !
whoa , easy .
breathe .
just a little wind knocked out of you .
there you go .
bad news , sports fan .
you picked the wrong guy' s girl to fornicate with !
what ?
i' m a cop , and becky belongs to me .
i think there' s a mistake .
really ?
because i had her followed ... and the tail came back with these photos ... and those skinny arms , concave chest ... kind of looks like you , don' t you think ?
no .
shit !
all these sugary snacks !
would you actually put this stuff in your body ?
ok .
all right .
you made the biggest mistake of your life ... when you messed with my girl , cupcake .
and mistakes have consequences .
help !
please , somebody !
hello .
today is your lucky day .
come on .
come on .
i don' t even know you !
get in .
get in where ?
the dumpster .
really ?
yeah .
just give me a second here .
you sicken me .
i told you , there' s a big mix up !
what happened ?
i was mugged .
oh , my god .
paul , you' re bleeding .
what is all this stuff ?
chocolate milk and cheese puffs .
oh , my god , paul .
i don' t know .
i was carrying the groceries ... and this guy tried to take them from me .
but i fought back .
i fought like a tiger .
i had the strength of ten men .
he ran away like a little girl .
sweet .
did you get a good look at him ?
not really .
it all happened so fast .
what color was his hair ?
red .
dreaded ... in a way that i' ve never seen .
dreadlocks .
and a gold tooth .
that is so street .
size ?
was he big , tall , short ?
five six .
or six two .
somewhere in there ?
yeah .
any identifying marks ?
yeah .
a heinous scar .
over his left eye .
your left eye , sir , or his left eye ?
you' re pointing to your right .
looking at him , his left eye or your left ?
his left side .
you' re sure ?
yeah .
left eye .
he had a tattoo .
a barbed wire choker tattoo .
probably gang related .
gangbanger .
was the assailant caucasian or non caucasian ?
non .
was he black ?
not necessarily .
what was he ?
mix .
black , white .
black , white .
light skinned black man .
or a dark skinned white man .
god , it must have been so confusing .
did he say anything to you ?
oh , god , paul , did he say something to you ?
yeah .
don' t keep that inside .
what did he say ?
he said ...
it' s ok .
give me those groceries , whitey .
give me your groceries , whitey .
well ...
but you say he could' ve been white himself .
you did say that , sir .
what' s going on here ?
am i on trial ?
i didn' t even do anything !
i told you it happened all so fast .
you' re safe .
that' s it .
i think we' re done here .
that' s it for paul .
good luck .
we' re just trying to get the facts ... do our job .
thanks .
good luck with everything .
you poor thing , sweetheart .
just sit tight .
i' il get you some aspirin .
thank you , baby .
i' il be interested to see ... if the police come up with any leads .
honey , i don' t think they will .
a little mugging ...
they have bigger fish to fry .
but they' re good men .
what are these ?
i don' t know .
i' il tell you what they are ... women' s underwear .
i found them in the toilet tank .
the toilet tank ?
the water was leaking , so i went to lift the ...
what is going on here ?
did you have a girl in this apartment ?
karen !
absolutely not !
those underwear are yours .
no , they are not .
they were gonna be yours .
i got them for you .
for your birthday .
enjoy .
my birthday was three months ago .
i know .
but then i found that locket you wanted ... and i gave that to you instead .
i wanted to give these to you at a later date ... so i went ahead and hid them in the toilet tank .
why aren' t they in a box ?
why aren' t they in a box ?
oddly enough , that' s how they came .
i found them in an underwear bin .
a bin ?
where do they sell underwear out of a bin ?
spend mart .
you expect me to believe ... that you purchased a pair of underwear ... out of a bin at spend mart .
is that your story ?
yeah .
oh , my god .
these are dirty .
what ?
that' s disgusting !
i can' t believe those fuckers sold me dirty underwear !
that is just wrong !
now i' m really glad i didn' t give them to you .
i' m hungry .
should we eat something ?
paul , listen to me .
i am not stupid .
please tell me what' s going on here ... and i want you to be totally honest with me .
did you have a girl in this apartment ?
i trusted you , you son of a bitch !
how do you like that ?
no , i did not .
fine .
what are you doing ?
i' m calling spend mart .
they probably want to know ... that they are selling dirty women' s underwear .
karen , come on , this whole thing' s silly .
i doubt they' il admit they sell dirty underwear .
i' m sure it' s against corporate policy .
spend mart , where you spend less .
i have a question regarding your underwear bins .
underwear bins ?
my fiance has informed me ... that he bought a pair of dirty women' s underwear ... out of one of your bins ... and i wanted to hear your thoughts on this .
my thoughts ?
on our underwear bins ?
these are my thoughts .
i' m sick of it .
it' s some college kids playing a prank .
they been putting dirty underwear in our bins .
what ?
what did he say ?
on behalf of spend mart , i' d like to apologize .
why don' t you have your fiance come down ... and we' il exchange them for a fresh pair ... or refund your money .
ok ?
poor bastard .
underwear bins ?
it' s a guy thing .
bullshit !
god , i am really sorry .
i feel terrible .
it' s ok , honey .
i am a terrible person for accusing you .
no , you are so honest .
i don' t deserve you .
thank you .
i love them .
i knew you would .
let' s just forget about it .
let' s pretend it never happened .
i love you , you love me , that' s all that matters .
one sec !
i got home from work ... and found these pictures in my son' s room .
he was standing over them .
are we on the same page ?
don' t speak !
in the future , would you find a way ... to dispose of your pornography ... so it doesn' t wind up in the hands of children ?
absolutely .
i apologize .
who' s at the door ?
our neighbor , mr ...
minister ferris .
mr. minister ferris .
hello .
i' m karen , paul' s fiancee .
congratulations .
you move right along , don' t you ?
mr. minister ferris stopped by to recommend a tv special .
wow , that' s great .
thanks for thinking of us .
we' il keep that ...
son ...
i' ve got my eye on you .
ok , then .
that was awfully thoughtful of him .
i think he was checking out your crotch .
karen , he' s a man of the cloth .
let' s not rashly accuse him of being some weird pecker checker .
i' ve got to go to the bathroom .
ok .
shit .
do you smell smoke ?
ok .
oh , shit !
is something burning ?
i smell smoke .
i lit a match , if you know what i mean .
do you still have diarrhea ?
yeah , i do .
i tell you , you think you got it licked ... it comes right back to kick you in the butt .
if this keeps up , we' il have to plan ... our whole wedding day around your bowel movements .
hello ?
hey , paul , it' s becky .
jimmy boy !
what' s up ?
nothing much , jimmy boy .
i got a visit from my lunatic ex fiance .
he' s got pictures of us together .
hey , baby !
can i get a gin and tonic ... and maybe you in bed ?
i don' t know what he' il do with them ... but he' s got a steroid rage problem ... so i' m thinking that' s not a good thing .
that is great news !
what' s going on ?
it' s jim .
he got a promotion .
wow .
here' s the deal .
ray' s working the night shift .
we can sneak into his apartment and get the negatives .
you' re the man , jim .
pick me up at 10 : 00 at the soho .
you know where that is ?
great .
don' t be late and bring a flashlight .
wait .
i want to congratulate jim .
six bucks ?
i wanted to talk .
you did ?
i' m sorry .
hello ?
i' m so glad you called back .
congratulations on the big promotion .
thanks , karen .
it was a long time coming .
ok , here' s paul .
jim ?
paul .
you' re getting better at this , buddy .
hang on , call waiting .
hello ?
paul morse ?
yeah ?
we found your man .
you' re kidding .
i don' t see him in there .
i' m sorry .
take a good hard look .
just take your time .
nope .
none of these guys .
let' s motor .
thank you , gentlemen .
i know he means well , but i' m ready to get a divorce .
even the gardener looks good to me at this point .
the issue is ...
those are my presets !
who' s that ?
that' s me .
it' s for the wedding video .
you were wearing knee socks .
that' s a uniform .
a requirement of the troop , ok ?
hat man !
look at you in that fedora .
not every kid can pull that look off .
my mom said i looked like indiana jones .
your mom loved you very much .
this is it .
we gotta be quick .
let' s lock and load .
someone is always expecting someone .
the trick is figuring out who .
who' s there ?
get off the buzzer !
brian , is that you ?
holy shit !
you didn' t mention that ray had a dog .
what if he wakes up ?
yeah .
i forgot to mention that part .
just be quiet , get the pictures ... and get out of here .
what the hell is this ?
i found them !
wait , what' s his name ?
little ray .
we should run .
go !
go !
go !
ok , right here !
hurry !
close it !
we can handle this .
it' s only a dog .
i gotta be smarter than a dog .
ok .
calm down .
watch this .
you ready , little ray ?
good throw .
yeah .
we' re screwed .
what are we going to do ?
good question .
we' re stuck in this bathtub .
it could be hours .
ray' il come home , take a shower ... find us in his bathtub , and kick my ass !
you' re upset .
what ?
plus , you' re on my foot .
god , it' s asleep .
i gotta take my boot off .
help me out .
seriously ?
that is one weird looking foot .
didn' t stop you from trying to sleep with it .
know what karen' il do when she finds out ?
i have an idea .
she' il call off the wedding .
her dad' s gonna fire me .
maybe getting fired by uncle kenny ... wouldn' t be the worst thing in the world .
it' s a good job .
you like it ?
i sell ad space in hunting and recreation magazines .
what' s not to like ?
wow .
excuse me ... not everybody can do whatever they want .
work five different jobs ?
that' s not the way real life works .
do you smell that ?
what ?
fear .
you' ve got the smell of fear all over you .
can we switch , please ?
what about you ?
i' m trying some stuff out .
i' d rather do that ... than get stuck doing something i don' t love .
i' ve never been in a bathtub with a girl before .
it' s not so bad , is it ?
nah .
i' ve got an idea .
if i slide this door open ... at the same time that you slide that door open ... we can jump out while the dog hops in .
ok ?
ok .
come on , little ray .
you ready ?
ready ?
one , two , three !
who' s the tough dog now ?
why aren' t we going out the front door ?
i' il tell you later .
come on .
i get it .
take the fire escape like on tv .
keep your voice down !
i can do this .
all right .
come on , let' s go !
i can' t .
i' m afraid of heights .
you just walked down all these stairs .
this is different .
it' s ok .
come on .
we got to go .
ok .
ok .
just hold onto the rail .
you got it ?
see ?
it drops down .
it wasn' t too bad , was it ?
yeah .
that was fun .
ok , let' s go .
i can' t believe i pulled it off .
we . " we pulled it off .
we could have been stuck in that tub for hours .
and i saved your life on the fire escape .
you' re pretty good at this .
have you done this before ?
i love this hill !
hit the gas !
what ?
here ?
go !
just trust me !
all right !
go !
go !
oh , my god !
that was unbelievable !
i' ve never done anything like that !
can we do that again ?
sure .
that was fun .
yeah .
good times .
i never thought i' d do anything like that .
god , it was just amazing .
you know , in the car ?
anyway ...
so , i' il see you ...
at the rehearsal dinner .
ok .
becky ?
you and ray , how' d that happen ?
how did i end up with a psycho ?
yeah .
what can i say ?
bad taste .
well ... there aren' t too many winners like me out there .
you joke , but you really are a good guy .
guys like you are hard to find .
good night .
shit .
you gotta be kidding me .
hi !
caught him with over an ounce of blow ... in his passenger seat .
that ought to put him away for a while .
great bust , ray .
go out and celebrate .
don' t be afraid to rough him up a little .
he likes it .
what ?
how about you start from the beginning ?
what beginning ?
he pulled me over , he put the drugs in my car ... and now i' m here !
what do you mean ?
it wasn' t working right , so i panicked ... because i had to be somewhere .
and so i ran out , and that was the dance lesson .
we know .
with howard .
that howard .
so incredibly graceful .
you fellas can go .
who are you ?
internal affairs .
you were pulled over last night by ray donovan ?
is that correct ?
yeah !
but i ...
do us a favor and shut up .
we know you didn' t do anything .
really ?
oh , my god .
so i can go home ?
it' s not that simple .
you need to do something for us .
no .
i' m getting married tomorrow .
i have a rehearsal ...
listen , stringbean , we don' t care what you want ...
this is about what we need .
yeah .
remember also to keep calm and cheerful .
don' t let petty things get you off course .
no one wants to be a failure .
no one wants a life constantly filled ... with worry , fear , and frustration .
therefore , remem ...
oh , my god .
shit , shit , shit .
hey , mister !
oh , shit !
it' s jim .
where the hell are you ?
this isn' t cold feet , is it ?
i' m really confused .
are you all right ?
shit !
ok , so i guess i' il go stand in for you .
maybe we' il see you at the rehearsal dinner .
there he is !
where you been , buddy ?
karen' s got her nuts in a bunch .
here he is !
sorry , i' m late .
i know , i know .
hi , baby !
hi .
there you are .
about time , too .
there' s my man !
how did you do this ?
it was nothing .
i thought we' d start ... with the tomato boats with pickle skippers ... and the asparagus a la toastette .
and i got a little roasted rosemary chicken .
comes out with a crispy skin , and it' s all moist .
thank you .
are you ok ?
i think so .
just a little tired .
but this is ...
this is incredible .
this is ... just amazing .
nice guy .
and just in case mom' s recipe disappoints ...
you missed the rehearsal !
i was stuck in traffic .
traffic ?
yeah !
fifty min ...
paul , this is minister green .
let' s pray you don' t get stuck in traffic tomorrow .
from your mouth to god' s ears .
i have to tell you , paul ... that i put a lot of thought into tomorrow' s ceremony .
it will be somber , sacred ... a reminder of what the true meaning of marriage is .
that' s nice .
i' m looking forward to it .
okey dokey , dinner' s ready !
ken , sandy , go over there .
honey , why don' t you come over here ?
so , kenny ... what do you think of the condo ?
it' s great .
it' s got a lot of ... character .
when i gave up the bachelor pad ...
i said to dorothy ...
i' il move in with you under one condition .
it' s gotta reflect my style .
the duke .
signed by the artist .
hold on a minute , son .
this is juice .
i prefer the wine .
i' m sorry , ma' am .
mrs. cooper ...
i don' t care what you were told .
i' m strong for an old lady , aren' t i ?
yes , ma' am .
wine , please .
honey , you look very handsome tonight .
i love that sweater on you .
thanks .
it' s very sharp .
are you having fun ?
yeah ...
absolutely ...
great party .
i know !
and it' s all for us !
yeah .
i' m gonna slip off to the powder room .
go ahead .
i' il be here .
she' s very sweet .
yeah , i know .
i' il be right back .
check this out .
what is that ?
the cops are on to ray .
they' re making me wear this .
they' re sitting outside listening .
oh , cool .
check one .
one adam 12 .
breaker 1 9 , this is ex tiki dancer ...
who is she ?
some idiot .
what are you doing ?
oh , my god .
sorry .
i' m wearing a wire .
what are we gonna do ?
this gravy is absolutely heavenly .
somebody smells really good .
know what i' m saying ?
i suddenly realized ...
did you know this ?
i was a surfer .
i had a longboard .
know what the real mark of greatness is ?
it' s the duke !
why , thank you , pilgrim .
out there riding on the horse ... man versus nature versus himself !
because man fights his own self ... to find out what it is about him ...
everyone ?
i' d like to propose a toast .
to the chicken !
man , how good is that stuff ?
the story of how paul and karen got together ...
is old news to pretty much everybody ... but i like to tell it because it gives me a chance ... to remind my brother that i am the one responsible ... for all of his future happiness .
that' s right .
she talked to me first .
and if i had not been married at the time ...
i would' ve whisked her out of that bar so fast ... it would' ve straightened out her perm .
i knew right then that karen was a special woman .
she' s the kind of woman ... who helps a guy figure out the answers ... that she would make an incredible partner ... and a wonderful wife and mother .
the minute i saw her , i knew she would be the one .
and that paul would be a happy man ... for the rest of his days .
so i raise my glass to karen .
i wish both her and my brother ... all of the happiness in the world .
well done , pete !
well done !
nice job !
you like that , padre ?
it' s got a great beat .
here' s the same thing , only backwards .
that' s satan , man !
i cannot believe you mentioned the night we met .
when will you let me live that down ?
how many stories do i have ... about attractive women hitting on me in bars ?
i don' t know .
maybe when cute married guys don' t wear wedding rings ... that is the risk they take .
i actually remember the song playing on the jukebox ... the night that we met .
me , too !
you remember the song that was playing ... the night i met karen ?
it' s one of those songs that sticks in your head ... and ruins years of your life .
no , pete , you are surely mistaken .
islands in the stream " is a great song .
what does the line ...
when we rely on each other , uh huh ...
what does that mean ?
it means that they' ve come to realize something ... that they rely on each other ... and as they realize that they say " uh huh .
no , they realized the music was still going ... and they' d run out of lyrics ... so they made up some nonsense syilables .
pete , you' re killing me !
excuse me .
that is a beautiful song .
i remember what you were wearing that night .
you looked so cute , i thought you had mascara on .
hey , ma .
hi , honey .
you got a second ?
sure , baby , it' s your night .
what ?
you and buck .
yeah ?
you' re pretty happy , huh ?
yeah .
very happy .
your stepfather' s different .
he' s very , very different ... but there' s just something about him .
he gets me .
he lets me be myself .
i' ve never been happier , honey .
one , two , three , draw !
i think she got you !
i' ve just never been happier .
who do you have to know ... to get a little grey poupon around here ?
ray !
it' s you , in my apartment , making a sandwich .
it wouldn' t kill you to keep lettuce in the crisper .
no , it wouldn' t , ray .
ray' s here .
he' s coming .
he' s right there .
i don' t know what you did to get your butt out of jail ... but you think you' re the only slippery guy ...
i' ve ever dealt with ?
no , ray .
do you think planting evidence is all i got ?
i got a whole bag of tricks ... including kicking your ass .
you know what ?
bring it on .
oh , a gift .
how do you like this package , ray ?
hey , yo mama !
what did you just say ?
what ?
i have to ask you to leave now , seriously .
that' s a death lock .
you ain' t getting out .
that' s good .
can i ask you a question ?
yeah , shoot .
how do you cheat on a girl like becky ?
how do you cheat on a girl who' s funny and beautiful ?
who speaks fluent chinese ?
who' s afraid of heights ?
which is kind of sweet .
who' s such a bad dancer .
and those feet .
a girl who' s ...
sorry .
police !
freeze !
get your hands in the air or i' il shoot you !
where were you guys ?
you' re going away for a long time .
whoa !
wait !
hey !
for making a sandwich ?
we' il take the tape now .
what ?
wow , i ...
hold on .
you were wired ?
yeah , ray , i was .
son of a bitch !
get him !
get off me !
get off me , mini cop !
thanks for your help .
yeah , big man !
wearing a wire !
asshole !
this is a disaster .
we didn' t all wear bow ties to school when we were 13 .
i was eccentric .
it was a phase .
are you ok ?
am i ok ?
let me see , pete .
i woke up with a tiki dancer in my bed six days ago ... then i found out she was my fiancee' s cousin ... then i got mugged by her psycho cop ex boyfriend .
that' s right ... cop .
i broke into his apartment and stole his property ... which is a felony ... then i got arrested ... but not for breaking and entering ... which is probably what you were thinking ... for cocaine possession .
and as a bonus , i got crabs from a toilet seat .
that' s bad .
i got rid of them .
shit !
i forgot to book the string quartet !
give me your phone !
this is going to be fine .
it' s going to work out ... and you and karen will be together ... which is the most important thing ... because she is ...
pete , don' t start , please !
yeah ?
jim !
i forgot to book the string quartet .
jimmy anticipated as much , and i got you covered .
oh , my god , thank you so much .
late !
he' s on it .
everything' s going to be fine .
how do i look ?
great .
see you out there .
all right , thanks .
oh , my god .
ken !
mr. cooper !
i didn' t ...
were you in that stall the whole time ?
i' il tell you what i' m going to do .
i' m going to overlook what i just heard .
i believe that you love my daughter .
and in spite of everything ...
you' re going to make her happy .
am i right ?
yeah , but i can explain ...
i don' t want to hear it .
what' s done is done .
but , sir , i didn' t actually do ...
paul , forget it .
we' re men .
we' re hunters .
it happens .
here .
it' s a butter dish .
and i just gave away the surprise .
thanks .
i know that a lot of weird ...
fun weird things happened recently .
you know that stuff i said about taking chances ?
that was all bullshit .
you' re a great guy ... and karen' s a great girl , so congratulations .
see you in there .
how about those pants ?
those look good .
hey , buck !
how are you ?
pretty big deal .
hi , sandy !
sorry .
music all set ?
it' s all good .
you' re a little late .
sorry .
tonya .
chicks .
you brought tonya ?
yeah .
i figured i' d throw her a bone ...
before i dumped her .
hi , jim .
i need my lipstick , baby .
where is it ?
what the heck ?
how' d that get in there ?
hey , paul .
we met at your bachelor party .
i' m tonya .
yeah .
i remember .
you !
you didn' t warn me about this cuddle monkey .
he' s been writing me poems and sending me flowers .
whoa , tonya .
lx nay on the oem pay .
two days and he gave me the keys to his apartment .
really ?
yeah .
i love you , cuddle monkey .
love you , too ... honey bear .
ok .
good luck .
maybe i love her a little bit .
you ready ?
let' s do this .
i almost forgot .
the minister' s sick .
something about the food last night .
what are you talking about ?
who' s going to marry us ?
showtime .
who are they ?
what the hell is that ?
howard !
i know , i know .
it' s rock and roll ... but we just need to find the beat .
what do you think ?
pretty sweet ?
is this really necessary ?
take my arm .
take it !
take it !
so pretty !
i' m daddy' s little girl , and you' re my great big man .
now , take me , hold me tight .
one , two , now fly ...
sorry , dear !
you' re flying , sweeties !
can you feel it ?
is this some kind of joke ?
this is so embarrassing .
i tried .
people like it , ok ?
it' s not that bad .
it sounds like a clam bake !
i had no choice .
i forgot the string quartet .
i give you one thing to do .
why did you pick a band ?
i didn' t do it !
dearly beloved , we are gathered here today ... in the sight of god ... ... in order to join this woman , karen ... and this man , paul ...
in holy matrimony .
if there is anyone here today ... who believes that these two should not be joined ... for all eternity ...
let him speak now or forever hold his peace .
we' re going to give you another minute or so ... to think about that .
anybody ?
anyone at all .
anyone with a reason .
it doesn' t even have to be a good reason .
if anyone even has a whisper of a feeling ... that' s enough .
that' s good enough .
i do .
hi .
i' m paul .
hi , paul .
i think i need to tell you all something ... before we go any further .
what' s happening ?
i' ve done some things this past week ... that i' m not proud of .
and people kept telling me ...
don' t worry about it .
it' s normal .
but i think they' re wrong .
and i' m going down a road i don' t like .
i don' t want to be that guy .
you know what i mean ?
this is like an aa meeting .
i was talking about fear the other day with someone ...
and it made me realize that i can' t remember ... the last time i' ve been afraid .
i mean , really afraid .
i' ve been playing it safe .
everything i do is safe .
and marrying karen ...
that' s not scary at all .
she' s beautiful , she' s funny , she' s smart ...
she' s perfect in so many ways ... but deep down , we' re not right for each other .
oh , god .
oh , no .
saying that was scary .
mr. minister ferris ?
yes , paul .
i don' t think karen and i should be joined for eternity .
uh huh ...
what' s that , pete ?
i just realized something about somebody ... and it made me say ...
uh huh .
that' s great , but i' m in the middle of something .
islands in the stream
that is what we are
no one in between
how could we be wrong ?
sail away with me
to another world
because we rely on each other
uh huh
what i realized is that i' m in love with karen .
what the hell is going on here ?
shut your yapping .
now , this is a wedding .
paul , would you mind if i asked karen to marry me ?
thank you .
karen ?
pete , god , i' d have to ...
well , not right here , not right now ... but maybe after a few dates .
oh , pete !
it' s ok .
i' m ok .
these are the days .
kenny , the good news is we' il still be in laws .
lady , you forget somebody ?
stop the cab .
asshole !
i was gonna wait for you .
you were great in there .
listen .
i just ...
i think i just figured something out back there .
because what i said ...
i don' t think i would have been able to say ... if it wasn' t for you .
and it also made me realize something else .
what ?
this .
where to , whitey ?
