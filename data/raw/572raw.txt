you are so beautiful .
you look like a rose blooming in a secret flower garden .
you , bastard !
this is private garden .
i really want you to look at this .
oh , this is from hollywood .
about the production of the scenario and casting you sent , we are in the middle of preliminary trials
the title is a bouquet of the adriatic sea .
that' s nice .
really ?
that means o. k. , doesn' t it ?
gina , come to hollywood with me .
i was air pirates ' guardsman to obtain a fame and fortune .
next i want to be a hollywood star .
and , then ?
the president !
i' m serious .
i promise to make you the first lady .
gina .
i like your for such stupidity .
really ?
but i say no , because i already have a gamble going .
when i' m in this garden , if he comes over here , i will love him .
but he comes only to the restaurant at night .
and never emerges in the daylight .
that guy is coming back .
fool ...
he left without getting off the plane .
i lost the gamble again .
you' re kidding !
the gamble is about that guy ?
is that a problem ?
life is more complicated here than in your country .
here i can fall in love anytime i want .
kid , go to hollywood by yourself , ok ?
kid ...
i hit my head because you did an acrobatic maneuver all of a sudden .
i just said hello to my friend .
to gina of the hotel adriano ?
she wore a white dress and was at the terrace of the hotel , wasn' t she ?
my grandpa told me that all pilots of the adriatic sea fall in love with gina
you speculate a lot .
so , how is the lady ?
you fell in love with her too , didn' t you ?
we are going down refuel .
close your mouth , or you' il bite your tongue .
wa !
wait !
uwaa ...
a girl on a fighter ?
where' s porco ?
he is talking with my dad .
not only the temporary government but guys in the king' s faction have tried to get along with the air pirates .
here you are .
thanks .
no thanks for such a bad news ...
you' d better present yourself to either side .
they will pay a fortune for your skill .
you got a cigarette ?
curtis is will go back to america sooner or later .
it' s us who should to go to america .
goodbye to freedom in the adriatic sea .
is it byron' s ?
no , it' s mine .
see you later .
porco , this is bad news .
the gas price is three times as much as in ltaly .
don' t be like a businessman , make it cheaper .
this gas is genuine .
that' s why i hate women .
hey , mr. would you tell her ...
pay him , fio .
after that , put your big butt and your looks in the space between the machine guns .
we' re going to fly to my home .
i' il add the gas bill to the other bills .
nobody can live alone .
we rely on each other .
nobody lives around here , even though the landscape is beautiful .
here we are .
that island is my home .
it' s a wonderful place .
an excellent co ordinator .
ohh ... my butt is stiff from the long flight .
the pig ...
don' t move !
they stinks , again ...
boss , we caught him !
boss !
shit !
don' t step on me ...
back off !
i was waiting for you , pig !
i knew you' d coming here .
you gave us a lot of trouble .
it' s a girl .
the pig is with a girl .
she is pretty ...
shut up !
what' s about a girl ?
about a half of the worlds population are women !
hey , that girl is not an ordinary one .
she is a chief engineer at the piccolo company .
but , she is very young and pretty .
that girl ?
she made my plane much better then before .
she may be young , but she' s really something .
is that true ?
you are good with airplanes in general .
be polite , boys .
she came with me to collect my debts .
you are deeply in debt after all .
it serves you right !
damage ?
are you going to break the plane i made ?
are you going to break such beautiful airplane with axes ?
miss , there is a complicated reason behind this ...
you are going to break , aren' t you ?
but , what i want to say is ...
are you guys really fighter pilots ?
would you back off ?
my shoes .
i have grown up with a lot of stories about the pilots since i was a small child .
my grandpa always told me that no one is as nice as the pilots .
it' s because sea and sky purify their hearts .
hence , the pilots are much braver then the sailors , and more proud then the ordinary pilots
don' t tell me .
i know that .
what they want the most , he said , is neither money nor women , but honor .
yes , you' re right !
a toast to the pilots !
she' s really something .
i understand .
i' il give up on breaking the plane , you made , with axes .
but we' il be mortified if we don' t do anything .
let' s lynch the pig !
lynch the pig !
what the hell you talking about !
you guys don' t understand anything .
i asked whether you feel ashamed or not .
aren' t you ashamed of being helped by curtis , the american ?
if your mother heard of that , she would cry , and don' t even take a shower .
porco came back to fight against curtis , for pride and honor of the pilots of the adriatic .
you guys are lowest of the low !
i told you not to hire curtis , eh !
just like a girl .
don' t try to excuse yourself .
boss , what are we supposed to do ?
she convinced us .
how about asking curtis to fight the pig ?
do we ask him to fight the plg , again ?
the contract is already over .
i' m ashamed of it ...
that' s curtis !
i got it .
i' m not going to run away !
you made your passage through there ?
hey , hold this .
you want a return match , don' t you .
but i won once , already .
besides , i am not a bounty hunter for these guys .
what' s your proposition ?
beautiful !
will you marry me if i win ?
i' m serious .
o. k.
instead , if porco wins , you pay these bills .
wait , fio !
you back off !
miss , you still have time to think about that .
ask him , not me .
this is very expensive .
it' s very cheap .
are you going to fight or not ?
i' m willing to fight for love .
o. k.
listen up everybody .
i' m really impressed with miss fio' s decision .
we , ' mamma aiuto ' , are going to back up this fight up !
yes ...
let the air pirates union do this , too !
yes ...
miss fio !
see you soon !
this sucks !
hey pig , don' t run away !
shut up , get lost !
bye bye !
this is ridiculous .
well , you are .....
don' t tell me .
i know , i am foolish .
fio ,
i think i have to say thank you .
you gave me a chance to fight curtis .
thanks .
we share the same luck .
we are partners , aren' t we ?
we are going to have a hard time .
i trust you .
trust me , eh ?
i haven' t heard that in a long time , but i' m glad you said that .
what' s wrong ?
you feel sick ?
fio ?
i' m fine .
it' s just that my heart is pounding .
to be honest , i was really scared .
hey ?
i want to swim .
porco !
i made a mistake !
are you o. k ?
i should have padded the deal .
we have a bad bargain .
ha, ha, ha, ha .
you' re right .
ha, ha, ha, ha .
porco ....
hmm ?
you can' t sleep , can you ?
now , i just saw ...
it may have been a dream ...
every thing is all right .
it' s too early in the morning to get up .
porco .
why did you become a pig ?
i don' t know .
i know a lot about captain marco pabatto .
my father used to be in the same unit .
i' ve heard many a story , in which the captain saved lives of enemy pilots , i liked it .
porco !
how about if i kiss you ?
you know a fairy tale where a princess takes off a curse on a prince , who was changed to a frog .
you , silly .
save it for your man !
won' t my kiss work ?
huh , you are a nice girl .
you make me feel comfortable and make me wish to be a human being again .
be a nice girl and go to sleep .
tell me your story and i will .
my story ?
well ...
it was the last summer of the war .
we were fly over the adriatic sea on our usual patrol .
belneldi was flying on my right side .
he was an old friend of mine .
he got married just two days before .
i was the matchmaker .
he didn' t have enough leave to be with his wife for long .
so , he returned to duty .
everyone was falling down like flies , whether a friend or a foe .
i was chased by three planes , and had no time to worry about my friend .
at the end i was the only one remaining of my unit .
but , they never gave up chasing me .
i made desperate efforts to run away .
my hands and feet went numb , and i grew dizzy .
i thought i was going to die .
it was at that time that
i saw the white sky .
white ?
yeah , it was like a flash .
because of the brightness , it took me a while to realize that i was in a cloud .
i was worn out , and didn' t have any power left to control my plane .
in spite of that my plane continued to fly .
a cloud of planes ...
yeah , it was calm , and the sky was very clear , too clear .
there was a line of clouds far above me .
belneldi , you are alive , aren' t you !
belneldi , wait , where are you going !
belneldi , don' t go !
are you going to leave gina alone ? !
i' il go instead of you !
when i recovered my senses , i was flying over the sea , almost touching it , alone .
god said it wasn' t your time yet , didn' t he ?
in my mind i thought he might let me fly like that forever .
that would not have been right , because your are a good guy !
good guys are all dead already .
besides , there might have been hell inside that cloud .
well , my story is over .
go to sleep .
shit , they gave me crap ...
i' m glad you came back to live because i like you .
good night !
hey , hey , which one' s gonna win , a pig or ... 08 : 07
you need ice cream , telescope ?
fools .
they make our fight into a festival .
are they all air pirates ?
trash of the mediterranean sea ...
gangs , pirates , smugglers , spies and even some ordinary people .
heh , this makes my fame rise more and more ...
ten minutes till start , ten minutes till start !
this is the fight between porco rosso and donald curtis !
there are no special rules , but an unfair fight will a disgrace to their fans .
shut up and start right now .
back off !
you shut up , or i kill you !
he' d be better off throwing a 10ton bomb ...
this is the fight which will determine the future of miss fio piccolo .
shut up !
do you understand ?
if you do , clap your hands .
clap !
shut up , that' s the routine .
well , both of you present your bids .
have a seat .
thank you .
put it on the chair properly !
none of you have anything to say , do you .
well shake hands or something before you start !
no way .
i' m fond of cleanliness .
he' s hard to please .
fio , as soon as this fight is over , we will go to the church .
don' t worry .
my mom told me your going to like me soon .
you ...
may i take a picture with you ?
i took a shower already .
everybody , smile !
smlle !
if the flight is over in 3 minutes , the black plane has the advantage ...
this is great .
i want them to do this event every month
15 seconds to go .
they are so cool ...
5 seconds to go .
4 , 3 , 2 , 1 , 0 !
curtis took over !
this is going to be a one sided fight .
give me that .
porco , what are you doing !
fly over !
he would be shot if the took off now .
it' s very difficult for curtis to shoot porco in this situation .
i know you want me to waste the bullet' s .
i know it .
looping !
the pig took curtis ' back !
looping ?
his skill made the pig an ace of the adriatic sea .
shit !
he' s gonna shoot !
he doesn' t open fire .
is his machine gun broken ! ?
i got it , i got it !
the pig won' t shoot until the end .
the pig doesn' t kill anybody .
now , the american should be fine .
you got it !
go and shoot !
oh , he didn' t shoot yet ....
see , i told you ...
if the pig opened fire , it would kill the american , so , it' s going to hit
curtis ' engine a few bullets after curtis gets tired .
he said this is not war , but ...
porco ...
are you teasing me or what ?
come on !
is your gun broken , huh !
you , poor bastard !
they are coming this way !
come on , pig !
go away from here and fight over there !
great !
the pig is leaving a cloud trail .
come on !
shoot that side !
it' s cool !
it' s the first time i saw the plance leaving a cloud trail !
i' ve never seen such an air fight before .
i' m really impressed .
i ready for the flight .
she' d better hurry , or the fight will be over .
she' s in her room , and doesn' t come out .
does she want to go or not ?
i want to see that fight ...
to g of heart , for the pig .
the air force found out about the fight .
stop the silly fight .
oh , this is must be from fierrali .
i should hurry .
first of all , both of them are very tough .
the show isn' t over !
porco , fight !
i' m not going to give fio to a man
iike you .
o. k. the pig took curtis ' tail .
it' s over !
this is the finish .
whoops ...
jammed , too .
you , idiot !
you are out of ammo !
whoops .
this is broken because of fio' s butt ...
i' m not going to finish this fight with a draw .
ha , ha , ha , ha .
this is not a western .
you can' t hit me .
you ...
you really think it will reach here ?
you , stinking pig !
can' t throw it !
bastard !
throw it finally !
for love !
shut up !
you piggy !
looks like something is wrong .
ah ... they are coming .
they are coming back !

bids don' t leave from here .
o. k. wait , you guys .
you , fat pig !
you , chicken cowboy !
come on with your bare hands !
go back to cows !
porco , hold on !
stand up , pig .
go , go !
bets still stand !
where' s the betting table ?
can' t you fly faster , much faster ?
it' s impossible .
engine would blow .
pilots are all stupid , aren' t they ...
hey , fio .
did you see my punch ?
i' m gonna take him down next round .
i' il take you down this time .
porco , hang on !
i' il make prosciutto out of you !
take aim !
come on , you chicken !
you are the chicken !
you seduce all women around you .
that was my word .
choose gina or fio , either one !
what ?
don' t choose both .
gina is ...
don' t say , gina , gina ...
gina loves you , pig .
she is ... waiting for you ... at the garden !
porco !
the sound of drum .
it' s over !
look at that !
i can see it .
the ltalian air force hasn' t arrived , yet .
you are unfair ...
you' re a dirty liar .
don' t you understand , you idiot .
i am not telling a lie ...
i don' t give fio to you .
that' s gina' s plane .
it' s an emergency signal .
1 , 2 ...
the winner is the one who stand up first .
everybody , let me through .
6 , 7 , gina , don' t .
8 !
marco , marco , can you hear me ?
do you want another girl to be unhappy ?

porco !
porco !
porco , thank you !

this party is over .
the air force will be here soon .
everybody run away quickly , please .
then stop by my restaurant .
i will serve you all .
everybody , let' s go !
it' s over , mr.
hey , boss , hurry up !
shut up !
i don' t like the pig , but i like you .
goodbye !
thank you .
take a shower sometimes , will you ?
thank you , too , mr. curtis .
next time i' il propose you formally , not as a bet .
o. k. but i' ve made up my mind already .
you , get on gina' s plane .
no !
no !
i' m going on porco' s plane .
you said i' m your partner , didn' t you .
gina .
take her home , please .
you always do this .
i' m sorry .
please leave .
let' s go .
the ltalian air force is finally coming .
do you want to help me ?
i' m going to lead them astray .
wait , the face !
let me see your face !
your plane is over there , eh ?
let me see it a little bit !
after the flight from the air force ,
i returned to milan .
i haven' t seen porco since .
instead , i have found a very good friend in miss gina .
since the of the fight , there have been many wars .
but i still keep in touch with gina .
after i take over the factory ' piccolo ' ,
i make it a rule to spend summer vacations at the hotel adriano .
miss gina has become more beautiful since .
old friends still stop by the hotel all the time .
mr. curtis , now i recall , writes to me sometimes though he is not the president of the u. s. , yet .
he says he longs for the summer of adriatic sea .
it' s only our secret that gina won her gamble ...
end thank you for watching
