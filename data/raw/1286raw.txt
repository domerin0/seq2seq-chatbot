i had this image of you inside of me ...
iike a part of me .
you planned this whole thing .
we make our own choice .
we pay our own prices .
five years is a long time .
where' s the fuckin ' money ?
all part of the business .
all part of the business .
you made a choice once .
what choice ?
i want out .
like a part of me .
hold the elevator .
thanks .
yeah , i looked over everything , sir .
i don' t think there should be any problems .
yes , sir , i ordered the vanity and i looked at the tub .
i' m pretty sure we can rout it out .
yeah , i' il start everything first thing tomorrow .
thanks again for this opportunity , mr. bianchini .
yeah .
hi .
my name is violet .
we sort of met on the elevator .
i' m corky .
i heard you working in here , and i was wondering ... if you' d like a cup of coffee .
sure .
come on in .
just give me a second .
all right .
what happened to rajiv ?
he went home to lndia or someplace , but i think he' il be back .
so this is just a temporary situation for you ?
yeah , pretty much .
one day at a time .
i guessed you' re a straight black .
good guess .
thanks .
my pleasure .
to be honest , i did have a slightly ulterior motive .
i was wondering if i might ask you a little favor .
favor .
yeah .
i' m kind of a night person , and i was wondering ... if you might wait a little bit before you start using the power tools .
oh , sorry .
oh , no .
no .
it' s not your fault .
it' s just the walls here are so terribly thin .
really .
it' s like you' re in the same room .
if it' s too much trouble , i understand .
it' s no trouble at all .
i got a lot to do here .
you doin ' all the work yourself ?
that is so amazing .
i am so in awe of people who can fix things .
my dad was like that .
we never had anything new .
whenever anything was broken , he would just ... open it up , tinker with it a little bit ... and fix it .
his hands were magic .
i' il bet your car is 20 years old .
truck .
truck .
of course .
' 63 chevy .
i knew it .
well , i guess i should be going .
you can drop the cup off at any time .
thanks .

i couldn' t even touch it .
now i love the way it feels .

i know you don' t believe me ... but i can prove it to you .
you can' t believe what you' d see ... but you can believe what you feel .

i had to see you .
look .
i don' t think this is a good idea .
i wanted to apologize .
no , please , don' t apologize .
if there' s one thing i can' t stand it' s woman who apologize for wanting sex .
i' m not apologizing for what i did .
i' m apologizing for what i didn' t do .
you have a bed somewhere ?
i can see again .
i needed that .
so caesar' s mafia , huh ?
you have to ask ?
no .
funny .
nobody really calls it that anymore .
caesar just calls it " the business .
how did you meet him ?
they took over a club i was working at .
caesar started managing it .
he' s a launderer ?
basically .
how long you been with him ?
about five years .
five years is a long time .
yes , it is .
the redistribution of wealth .
excuse me ?
lsn' t it what you wanted to know ?
what i did time for ?
the redistribution of wealth " ?
that' s what i tell someone when i' m trying to get them in my bed .
but i' m already in your bed .
my cell mate would say she did her time for getting caught .
she was always a lot more honest than me .
you didn' t have to tell me if you didn' t want to .
i guess i wanted to .
i' m glad you did .
so am i.
ding let me tell you about a girl i know ding
ding she is my baby and she lives next door ding
ding every mornin ' before the sun comes up ding
ding she brings my coffee in my favorite cup ding
ding that' s why i know ...
ding you think i don' t know that ?

come on .
will you just i have to leave tonight .
don' t make me beg , violet .
two minutes .
thank you .
hey , violet .
you look great .
i had this image of you inside of me .
like a part of me .
you are so beautiful .
what' s wrong ?
nothing .
yes , there is .
you didn' t want to see me , did you ?
if there' s one thing i can' t stand about sleeping with women ... it' s all the fucking mind reading .
i don' t understand .
i know , violet .
that' s ' cause you can' t understand .
we' re different .
we' re not that different , corky .
ah , let' s see .
this is the part where you tell me ... what matters is on the inside ... and that inside of you there' s a little dyke just like me .
no , she' s nothing like you .
she' s a whole lot smarter than you are .
is that what her daddy tells her ?
i know what i am .
i don' t have to have it tattooed on my shoulder .
you saying you don' t have sex with men ?
i don' t .
for christ' s sake , i heard you .
thin walls , remember ?
what you heard wasn' t sex .
what was it ?
work .
you made certain choices in your life that you paid for .
you said you made them because you were good at something ... and it was easy .
you think you' re the only person that' s good at something ?
we make our own choices .
we pay our own prices .
i think we' re more alike than you care to admit .
what about that guy this morning ?
shelly ?
don' t tell me .
you' re a workaholic .
no , shelly knows what i am .
he saw me in a bar with another woman .
yeah .
i suppose he just wants to watch .
fuck it .
i think you' d better leave .
yeah , i think i' d better .
try not to steal anything on the way out .
where the fuck is it ?
i didn' t do it !
i swear to you !
come on !
where is it ?
oh , that hurt , didn' t it ?
ow !
you think you' re smart ?
where' s that fuckin ' money ?
please , please !
please , let me go !
please stop it !
don' t make me beg !
stop it !
please !
please stop !
tryin ' to fuck us ?
you wanna fuck me ?
you piece of shit .
we' re goin ' home .
nobody fucks him !
i' m not fucking him !
i swear to god !
johnnie !
ho !
he' s making too much noise .
you hear that , bitch ?
shut up .
give me a towel .
shut up !
here .
put it in his mouth .
caesar , i' m leaving .
what ?
why ?
i didn' t use a good towel .
caesar , i' m serious .
i can' t take this .
i have to get out of here .
why ?
' cause you know him ?
aw , you see ?
baby , that' s what i love about you .
you' re so fuckin ' sensitive .
but i like you here .
i want you to stay .
this is hard on me too .
i like shelly .
so why don' t you watch some tv and put on a cassette or something ?
you okay , violet ?
mick , why is johnnie here ?
you know how i feel about that psycho fuck ?
caesar , didn' t i tell you to get something ?
sure .
sorry about that .
you shouldn' t have to see this .
why don' t you get out of here ?
go for a walk .
caesar wants me to stay .
don' t worry about caesar .
i' il handle caesar .
get out of here .
we can go all night , bitch .
okay .
thank you , mickey .
here you go .
all fuckin ' night , baby !
all night !
hey , johnnie , ease up , okay ?
bitch !
pick him up .
shelly ,
i' m gonna ask you ten times .
you understand ?
ten times .
yeah .
one .
where' s our money ?
you all right ?
come on .
let' s get out of here .
keep it .
shelly was skimming from the business .
he came to see me yesterday because he was afraid caesar found out .
he wanted to run , but he wanted me to come with him .
even though he knew about you .
yeah .
this guy' s in love with you ?
that' s what he tells himself , but it' s not even about me .
he could have run at any time , but he didn' t want out .
it sounds like he wanted to get caught .
yeah .
maybe he did .
he would brag to me all the time .
he was never afraid of caesar because ... he didn' t know him .
not like i do .
i used to be able to block it out .
or i' d just tell myself that ...
i wasn' t really there , and so ... none of it really mattered .
but i can' t do that anymore .
i' m making the same mistake shelly made ... but now i know what i want .
i want out .
i want a new life .
i see what i' ve been waiting for , but i can' t do it alone .
i need your help , corky .
caesar' s gonna get the money  how much money ?
shelly said it' s over two million dollars .
yeah .
so caesar' s gonna get it .
he' s gonna bring it by the apartment .
he' s gonna count it .
he' s gonna go through the books and try and figure out how shelly did it .
wait a minute .
violet , do you know what you' re saying ?
you' re asking me to help you fuck over the mob .
violet , these people are serious .
you wanna know how serious ?
ask your friend shelly .
they' re worse than any cop because they have lots of money and no rules .
you fuck them , you better do it right .
that' s why i need your help .
you said you were good .
i am good .
let' s just say for a moment i believe everything you' re saying .
you think i' m lying ?
i didn' t say that .
but since you did , iet' s say you are .
it would have been easy for you to set up shelly .
you could have had him killed ... knowing that caesar would bring the money back to the apartment .
all you would need to keep yourself clean is someone unconnected .
someone like me .
is that what you think ?
i' m just making a point .
you have no idea what you' re asking ... how much trust it takes two people to do something like this .
for me , stealing has always been a lot like sex .
two people who want the same thing .
they get in a room , they talk about it .
they start to plan .
it' s like flirting .
it' s kind of like foreplay .
because the more they talk about it , the wetter they get .
the only difference is , i can fuck someone i' ve just met .
but to steal , i need to know someone iike i know myself .
you think you know me like that ?
i wanna see the money .
oh , my god !
don' t worry .
it ain' t mine .
caesar , what happened ?
it was unbelievable , vi .
un fuckin ' believable !
shit !
look at this shirt .
look at it .
it' s ruined .
it all started when shelly took us to the money .
i' il tell you something .
mickey , he knows his shit .
he does .
shelly took us right there .
so shelly' s down on his knees , right ... and he' s pulling out this money from a safe on the floor ... and i' m standin ' there ... and i' m lookin ' at it , right ?
like , " holy fuck !
all i can think about is , " how the fuck was he able to do this , " when bang !
johnny caps him .
he caps shelly !
blood goes flyin ' everywhere .
all over me .
all over the money .
i have no idea if this is even all of it .
and right then , i go through the roof and bam !
i punch the dumb son of a bitch .
i punch him right in his dumb fuckin ' face .
i didn' t give a shit whose son he was .
i just wanted to hit him again smack some sense into the dumb son of a bitch !
look at the shit that i gotta fuckin ' deal with now !
what are you gonna do with it ?
i told him to run it through the cycle .
but no , johnnie calls up the old man , and i guess he' s got other plans ... because he wants to pick up this shit tomorrow night .
where' s the laundry detergent ?
it' s in the linen cabinet .
come to my place in the morning , early .
you think you know me like that ?
two million dollars .
you' re having second thoughts .
no .
you said caesar washed the money ?
yeah .
then what ?
exactly .
he hung it up .
he what ?
to let it dry .
it was unreal .
hundreds paper clipped everywhere iike leaves .
then one by one he ironed all of it .
did he sleep ?
no , but neither did i.
all night long i listened to that sound .
what sound ?
the sound of money .
where is it now ?
it' s in his office .
i saw it this morning .
i need to go to the store .
it' s in a case on his desk .
does the case lock ?
yes .
huh .
tell me about johnnie .
johnnie ?
sounds like he and caesar don' t like each other .
like each other ?
they hate each other .
why ?
i don' t know .
happened long before i came around .
i think it' s basically caesar thinks johnnie' s a complete idiot ... but , you know , what can you do ?
johnnie runs chicago ' cause gino' s his father .
who' s gino ?
gino marzzone .
marzzone , as in angelo marzzone , head of the marzzone family ?
yeah , that' s his brother .
shit .
gino marzzone' s coming to your place tonight to pick up the money ?
yeah .
and johnnie marzzone' s his son ?
that' s johnnie ?
yeah .
sweet jesus .
it' s perfect .
gino marzzone' s coming to your place tonight .
this is a big deal .
caesar' s gonna want to do it right .
he won' t want to look like an idiot .
has gino been to your place before ?
yeah , twice .
what happened ?
caesar was really nervous .
he kept cleaning the apartment .
the first time he picked out the dress he wanted me to wear .
did johnnie ever hit on you ?
johnnie hits on me all the time .
he hits on anything in high heels .
did caesar ever see this ?
he does it right in front of him .
this is getting better and better .
go on .
well , gino doesn' t speak much english , or at least he pretends not to ... so he usually gets right to the point .
both times they only talked for about five minutes .
they had a drink and then they left .
what did gino drink ?
scotch .
glenlivet .
i remember that ' cause caesar made a big deal about it .
all right .
i have an idea how to make this work .
go back and get ready .
take your time .
make it real .
what time did you say they' d be there ?
the plane gets in at 7 : 00 , so i' d say around 8 : 00 .
all right .
now , at some point , caesar' s gonna quit .
i guess sometime around 6 : 00 , making sure he' s got time to get ready .
as soon as he' s done , you' il be there to put a big drink in his hand .
unbelievable what this guy shelly did .
i' il tell you , shelly' s one smart ass motherfucker .
i mean , he was one smart ass motherfucker .
poor boy .
has to work so hard .
you want him to relax , unwind .
you look good enough to eat .
where will you be ?
i' il be waiting in the apartment next door .
waiting for what ?
for the shower .
that' s gonna be our signal .
when he' s done with his shower , you' il go to the bar .
you' il get out the scotch that gino drinks .
as you do , the bottle will slip from your hands .
an accident .
vi , what the hell was that ?
vi , you can' t hear me ?
ah , fuck !
caesar , it slipped .
i was trying to get ready .
how the fuck did you do that ?
caesar , it was an accident .
i didn' t mean to .
i' il get some more .
there' s no fuckin ' time !
don' t be silly .
there' s lots of time .
i' il clean this up and i' il be back before you' re even dressed .
fuck , vi !
when you open the door , i' il be there .
what if he sees you ?
he won' t .
you can' t know for certain that he won' t see you .
trust me .
i' m just asking .
what if ?
if he does ... then i won' t have a choice , will i ?
when i' m inside , i' il get the money .
i' m gonna need something to fill the case .
hide it near the desk .
and at that point ... there' s no turning back .
when i get the scotch ... how do i know you won' t just take off ?
the same way i' il know that you went to go get the scotch .
trust .
i still don' t see how i' m gonna get away clean ... with all the money in the apartment .
everyone' s gonna think i took it .
not caesar .
why ?
' cause of what you' re gonna tell him .
you gotta be as real as you can .
the moment you walk through that door with the scotch ... you' il be covered .
that moment' s the most important moment of the plan .
' cause if you' re real enough , he' s gonna believe you , ' cause deep down ... he' il want to .
c ?
shit , i' m sorry .
they were early .
what are you talkin ' about ?
they just left , didn' t they ?
what , are you drunk ?
they weren' t just up here ?
no , they' re still on their way .
that doesn' t make any sense .
why ?
i just saw johnnie downstairs .
what ?
yeah .
i was getting out of my car , and i saw him in his bmw .
nah , it couldn' t have been .
it was him , caesar .
i' m positive .
vi , that' s impossible .
caesar , i know johnnie .
it was him .
i screamed when i saw him .
i couldn' t believe i missed him .
i knew you were gonna be upset , so i thought i' d stop and apologize ... and give gino the scotch , but ...
i honked a couple of times , and johnnie didn' t even hear me .
he didn' t stop .
but ...
gino' s plane doesn' t get here for another half hour .
actually , i didn' t see gino in the car .
if caesar hates johnnie as much as you say , when he opens that case ... he' s gonna know in his gut that johnnie just fucked him .
he' il have no choice .
he can' t go after gino or johnnie .
there' s only one way out .
he' il have to run .
and if he runs ... everyone will assume he took the money .
you' il be clean , and we' il be rich .
jesus , that' s beautiful .
if you' re this goddamn smart , how did you ever get caught ?
i had a partner once .
she fucked me .
i won' t .
i think we' re gonna find out .
oh , god !
caesar ?
no .
c ?
oh , no .
oh , god .
vi .
vi , i' ve been set up .
johnnie ?
that fuck !
that rat fuck !
that motherless rat fuck !
why ?
why would johnnie do this ?
jesus christ .
violet , open your fucking eyes .
johnnie hates me as much as i hate him .
i hate that motherless rat fuck .
i fuckin ' hate him .
but you know he did it .
yeah .
so what ?
so fucking what ?
look , the money is gone , right ?
gino' s coming to get it .
do you think gino is going to believe me when i tell him ... his little rat fuck son stole it ?
' cause i don' t .
you know what i think ?
i' m a dead man .
i' m one in the back of the head .
that' s what i think .
what are we gonna do ?
i know what johnnie wants me to do .
johnnie wants me to run .
he wants me outta here .
but if i run , then everybody thinks i fucking did it ... and he gets away with two million clean .
i can see him right now ... on the way to get gino , iaughin ' at me !
laughin ' at me , laughin ' at me !
laughin ' at me !
fuckin ' laughin ' at me !
don' t !
please .
don' t touch me , okay ?
i gotta think .
i gotta fuckin ' think this through !
caesar , i think we should run .
we have to go now , before it' s too late !
please , violet , leave me alone .
please , all right ?
just leave me the fuck alone !
all right , caesar .
i gotta think , that' s all .
i just gotta think .
it' s me .
what happened ?
he totally freaked out .
i' ve never seen him like this .
he' s out of his fucking mind .
that' s all right , as long as he believes it was johnnie .
believes it ?
jesus !
it' s driving him crazy .
he wants to kill him .
i don' t know , corky .
i' m getting really nervous .
i don' t know what he' s gonna do .
it' s all right , violet .
it' s working .
all we gotta do is wait him out and see what he does .
what if he doesn' t run ?
that means he' il probably kill johnnie .
oh , christ !
i have to get out of here !
listen , if he doesn' t run , all you gotta do is break down .
go into the bedroom and pack some things .
start crying .
tell him you love him , but you can' t take it .
you' re sorry , but you gotta leave , and just walk out .
all right .
okay .
we' re almost there .
just hang on .
he' s coming !
i know what i have to do .
i have to get the money back .
the money ?
the money' s gone .
no , johnnie' s got it .
i gotta get it back .
it could be anywhere .
there' s not enough time , violet .
johnnie' s gotta pick up gino at the airport , right ?
that means he' s probably got the money with him in the car .
did he see you ?
no .
good .
that' s good .
that means i got the edge .
he doesn' t know i know .
that' s why he put the paper in the case .
he wants me to hand it to gino .
then there' s no doubt i did it .
gino will put a bullet in me himself .
but that' s not gonna happen .
that jack off' s not gonna set me up .
no way .
not like this .
this is insane .
what are you doin ' ?
i' m leaving .
i don' t want any part of this shit .
i don' t want to be involved .
you can' t leave .
the hell i can' t .
i need you .
you don' t need me .
you' ve never needed me .
i can' t help you , understand ?
i can' t let you leave .
if you' re not with me , i have to assume you' re against me .
caesar , this is crazy .
maybe it is .
maybe it isn' t .
maybe you dropped that bottle of scotch by accident .
maybe you didn' t .
i would' ve been so easy ... to let him in as you left .
you can' t believe that .
i' ve seen the way he looks at you .
he' s always wanted you .
maybe two million bucks finally bought you .
i' m sorry , violet .
i wanna trust you .
but you understand .
i don' t have any other choice .
you sure you don' t want a drink ?

yeah , well , you know , mick , i' m all wound up .
i' m driving myself crazy over this gino thing , and , well ...
vi , you know , she thought maybe ... she could , you know , relax me in the
that violet is one nice lady .
i wish someone would help me relax .
uh , let me get you guys a drink , huh ?
i got scotch , whatever you want .
we was worried about you .
me ?
why ?
we went over to johnnie' s place , just to check it out .
it was busted up , bad .
what ?
started thinking maybe it' s about the money .
so i call you , but all i got is the busy signal .
i figure the phone is off the hook .
that' s why i come rushing over here .
fuck , the phone .
shit .
that was me .
i did that .
fuck !
that was a stupid thing to do , huh ?
hey , if violet was helping me relax ...
i' d probably do the same thing .
hey , caes , can i ask you something ?
sure .
why did you move all the furniture around ?
let me guess .
that was violet' s idea too .
yeah , uh , actually ... she was nervous about gino comin ' ... and wanted everything to look perfect and
you know women , mick .
sure , caes .
they make us do stupid things , don' t they ?
ls that the money ?
yeah .
yeah , that' s it .

gotta hand it to the guy , but , jesus ... if i were him , i would' ve bailed a long time ago .
i mean , how much money does a man need ?
i remember , i was just staring at all this goddamn money .
shelly went down on his knees ... and the next thing i know , johnnie just blows his head off .
what a fuckin ' mess .
johnnie' s laughing his ass off ... and that' s when caesar lost it .
