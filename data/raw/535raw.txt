hey .
come on .
she planned her death in this room .
she thought it up right here .
right where you' re standing .
she knew you' d come .
she counted on you to see what she saw ... ... feel what she felt , know what she knew .
what did she do , angela ?
how should i know ?
what did she do , angela ?
i don' t know .
what would you do ?
i don' t know .
what did she do , angela ?
you know what she did .
what did she do , angela ?
you know what she did .
what are you afraid of ?
what did she do ?
what did she do ?
i don' t know !
when we were girls ... ... we would leave each other messages .
in light .
in breath .
on the windows .
john , there is no 17th act in corinthians .
corinthians goes to 21 acts in the bible in hell .
they have bibles in hell .
paints a different view of revelations .
says the world will not end by god' s hand ... ... but be reborn in the embrace of the damned .
though if you ask me ... ... fire' s fire .
16 : 29 , 16 : 30 .
oh , my , this is certainly not good .
the sins of the father would only be exceeded by the sins of the son .
whose son ?
but he can' t cross over , b.
impossible to cross over .
whose son ?
god' s son ?
no , the other one .
devil had a son too .
here it is .
this is the sign of mammon ... ... the son of the devil .
well , hold on , it says here ...
beeman ?
yeah .
sorry , i' m ...
i' m sorry , no , i' m right here .
it says mammon has no patience for his father' s rule ... ... and yearns to forge his own kingdom of fire and blood .
yeah .
mammon would be the last demon ... ... we' d ever want crossing over to our plane .
no , wait , wait , wait .
i' m reading .
seems to be a loophole .
always a catch .
it says first mammon would have to possess a very , very powerful psychic .
isabel .
but that wouldn' t be enough .
to cross over , mammon would need divine assistance .
to cross over , mammon would need the help of god .
the help of god ?
it says ...
beeman ?
john , look ... ... i know you' ve never had much faith , you' ve never had much reason to ... ... but that doesn' t mean that we don' t have faith ... ... in you .
beeman ?
beeman ?
drive .
fast .
beeman !
sulfur .
beeman !
beeman !
wasn' t just isabel .
i used to see things too .
but ... ... you already knew that , didn' t you ?
go home , angela .
i need to understand .
you don' t wanna know what' s out there , trust me .
i' m stronger than isabel .
your sister embraced her gift , you denied yours .
denial is a better idea .
it' s why you' re still alive .
stick with me , that will change .
i don' t need another ghost following me .
john , they killed my sister .
i' d trade places with her if i could .
i used to pretend that i didn' t .
that i didn' t see things .
and ... ... by the time we were 10 , they started forcing her to take ... ... antipsychotics ... ... and have treatments .
they would come for her ... ... and she' d look at me , and she' d say to me , " tell them .
why don' t you tell them , angie , that you can see them too ?
but i lied .
i don' t see anything .
until one day ... ... i finally stopped seeing .
i abandoned her , john .
i left her all alone .
i need to see what she saw .
please .
you do this , there' s no turning back .
you see them ... ... they see you .
understand ?
yeah .
sure .
so do i have to take the rest of my clothes off , or can i leave them on ?
john ?
i' m thinking .
john ?
on is fine .
so why water ?
it' s a universal conduit .
lubricates the transition from one plane to another .
now ask me if there' s water in hell .
is there water in hell ?
sit .
normally , only a portion of the body has to be suspended ... ... but you wanted the crash course .
yeah , i wanted the crash course .
so ...
so , what' s gonna happen ?
lie down .
what do you mean lie down ?
you have to be fully submerged .
for how long ?
as long as it takes .
take a deep one .
oh , god .
oh , god , all those people .
oh , isabel .
i' ve always known .
i' ve always known where they are .
i' ve always known where to find them ... ... where to aim and where to duck ... ... and i' ve always known where they were .
i' ve always known that it wasn' t luck .
always known that it wasn' t luck .
i' ve always known ...
i' ve always known that i could see .
i' ve always known that i could see .
angela .
someone was here .
it was his .
rolling .
not a ball .
something smaller .
shiny .
balthazar .
sorry .
can you just kill him ?
what about the balance ?
half breed tipped the scales when he started killing my friends .
i' m just adding some counterweight .
john , i really want ...
think of it as a bulletproof vest .
i' m coming with you .
you' re staying in the car .
fire ?
i was born of this .
how' s mammon crossing over , you half breed piece of shit ?
that' s better .
au naturel .
stay in the car .
wait here .
men .
don' t fight it , johnny boy .
enjoy it .
we' il see you very soon .
not really , no .
you can' t cheat it this time .
you' re going back to hell .
true .
but you' re not .
what are you doing ?
i' m reading you your last rites .
spare me your remedial incantations .
you do know what it is to truly be forgiven ?
to be welcomed into the kingdom of god .
demon in heaven .
i' d love to be a fly on that wall .
you' re not a priest .
you have no power .
just tell me how mammon is crossing over ... ... and you can go back to your shithole .
okay , bally , enjoy it .
may god have mercy on you and grant you the pardon of all your sins .
whose soever sins you remit on earth , they are remitted unto them in heaven .
how ?
how' s he doing it ?
no .
no , i can' t .
grant your child entry into thy kingdom ... ... in the name of the father and the son and the holy spirit .
amen !
the blood of god .
he found it .
whatever killed the son of god ... ... will give birth to the son of the devil .
by the way ... ... you have to ask for absolution to be forgiven ... ... asshole .
my work here is done .
what are you laughing at ?
she was my only mission ... ... and you brought her right to us .
so does this walking fast mean you' ve found something ?
jesus didn' t die from being nailed to a cross .
he was killed by a soldier' s spear .
the spear of destiny .
i' m a catholic , john .
i know the crucifixion story .
i drew out the sister as you asked .
she' s been made flush and ready .
so much power .
now , if you grant me my resurrection , i shall serve .
wait .
but i did as we agreed .
no .
please .
no !
beeman said mammon needed divine assistance to cross over .
how' s the blood of god' s only son ?
the stains on the spear .
yeah .
so he gets the spear .
he still has to locate a powerful psychic .
not really .
twins .
where' s the amulet ?
i don' t know , i must have left it in the ...
what' s wrong ?
i don' t know , i just feel ...
bird on a ladder .
sorry .
wait here .
yeah .
who' s a rat in a dress now , huh , bitch ?
have you lost what little mind you have ?
don' t .
i need to use the chair .
i offer no aid to one side or the other .
the balance .
screw the balance .
you dare ?
in my house ?
is this neutral ?
bullshit .
you' re the only one still playing by the rules , midnite .
and while you' ve been imitating switzerland , people are dying .
hennessy , beeman , they were your friends once too , remember ?
i need your help !
consider it a last request .
you play a dangerous game .
two hundred dollar shirt , by the way .
that little shit has been trying to climb out of his father' s shadow for eons .
i' d hate to think what he would do to this world if he ever broke through .
forgot how big it was .
two hundred souls passed through this wood and steel at sing sing .
yeah .
which way' s east ?
how many years since you' ve surfed ?
like riding a bike .
no , not really .
tell me this isn' t about the girl .
definitely mostly not about the girl .
cold .
little flavor ?
sure about this ?
no .
midnite !
any luck ?
that' s a word for it .
holy shit .
you' re papa midnite , aren' t you ?
and how exactly do you intend on getting close enough to use these ?
well , they did not leave her unguarded .
half breeds are most vulnerable ... ... when their outer skin is breached by holy water .
certain objects , most notably either of the two crosses of isteria ... ... have been used by even the unordained to bless ... ... commonly occurring waters ... ... even rain .
maybe if ...
there' s no use sitting on the bench if you' re not ready to play , right ?
you wouldn' t have one of those enchanted crosses here in a cabinet ... ... maybe we could take with us ?
look , john , no offense , i just don' t think that it' s a great idea , you know ... ... you going on a solo mission to save the world .
that' s my vote .
i don' t know what pops thinks , but that' s ...
take him , john .
kill him after .
if you get back , see me about membership .
maybe .
okay .
i will .
what are you doing ?
praying .
praying .
okay .
come on .
half breeds , right ?
a birth like this , they' re definitely gonna be guarding her , right ?
definitely .
yeah .
we can get through them .
i mean , that cross has gotta work , right ?
right ?
it' s not always like it is in the books .
what is that ?
hellspeak .
you know what to do .
i' m okay .
sure .
one last show .
hi .
my name' s john .
you are in violation of the balance .
leave immediately ... ... or i will deport you .
all of you .
go to hell .
holy water ?
angela .
john ?
john .
shit .
pull !
angela .
angela , what is it ?
get it out .
get it out .
get it ...
oh , my god .
not bad , kid .
not bad . " you hear that ?
you know why that is ?
it' s because this is kramer .
chas kramer , ass ...
chas .
you' re right , john .
it' s not like the books .
no ... ... it isn' t .
into the light , i command thee .
into the light , i command thee .
into the light , i command thee .
into the light , i command thee .
your ego is astounding .
gabriel .
figures .
and the wicked shall inherit the earth .
you judging me now , john ?
betrayal , murder , genocide , call me provincial .
i am simply seeking to inspire mankind to all that was intended .
by handing earth over to the son of the devil ?
help me here .
you' re handed this precious gift , right ?
each one of you granted redemption from the creator .
murderers , rapists and molesters ... ... all of you , you just have to repent ... ... and god takes you into his bosom .
in all the worlds in all the universe ... ... no other creature can make such a boast , save man .
it' s not fair .
if sweet , sweet god loves you so ... ... then i' il make you worthy of his love .
i' ve been watching you for a long time .
it' s only in the face of horror that you truly find your nobler selves .
and you can be so noble .
so ... ... i' il bring you pain .
i' il bring you horror .
so that you may rise above it .
so that those of you who survive this reign of hell on earth ... ... will be worthy of god' s love .
gabriel ... ... you' re insane .
the road to salvation begins tonight .
right now .
i know i' m not one of your favorites .
i' m not even welcome in your house .
but i could use a little attention .
please .
come forth .
hurry .
mammon ... ... son of satan ... ... i unleash you unto this world .
lu .
what took you so long ?
hello , john .
john , hello .
you' re the one soul ... ... i would come up here to collect myself .
so i' ve heard .
you mind ?
oh , go ...
go right ahead .
i' ve got stock .
coffin nail .
very fitting , john .
you know , when you cut too deep , you cut the tendons ... ... finger movement goes out the window .
let me help you .
see ?
sonny ... ... i' ve got a whole theme park full of red delights for you .
well , aren' t you a peach .
i didn' t think you would make the same mistake twice .
and you didn' t ... ... did you ?
so how' s the family ?
family' s doing just fine .
busy , busy , busy .

word is that kid of yours is a chip off the old block .
well , one does what one can .
he' s in the other room .
boys will be boys .

no accounting for taste , really .
they have the spear of destiny .
they have the spear of destiny .
or is it another one of your cons ?
go look for yourself .
you' ve waited 20 years for me , lu ... ... what' s another 20 seconds ?
lucifer .
this world is mine .
in time .
you , best of all of us , gabriel ... ... should understand ambition .
son of perdition .
little horn .
most unclean .
i do miss the old names .
time to go home , son .
i will smite thee ... ... in his honor .
looks like somebody doesn' t have your back anymore .
father ?
so .
so .
yeah , what do you want ?
an extension ?
the sister ... ... isabel .
what about her ?
let her go home .
you' re willing to give up your life so she can go to heaven ?
fine .
it' s done .
time to go , john .
yeah .
the sacrifice .
no .
this one belongs to me .
no .
you will live , john constantine .
you will live .
so you will have ... ... the chance to prove ... ... that your soul truly belongs in hell .
oh , you will live .
you will live .
thank you .
no problem .
human .
you don' t deserve to be human .
do you want revenge ?
is that what you' re thinking right now ?
do it .
do it .
seek revenge .
end my life .
go on .
be the hand of god .
it' s your choice .
it' s always been your choice .
yeah .
that' s called pain .
get used to it .
you could' ve shot me , john !
you chose a higher path !
look how well you' re doing !
nice spot .
i have something for you .
something tells me you' re not a flowers kind of guy .
oh , how thoughtful .
john ... ... why are you giving me this ?
rules .
hide it .
somewhere no one will ever be able to find it .
not even me .
always a catch .
yeah .

i' ve got some cleaning up to do .
i' il ... ... see you around .
i' d like that .
i guess there' s a plan for all of us .
