look , look .
if i' m going to die , i prefer to die in my own home .
i' m staying put .
god forbid .
i' ve got something .
listen .
received from the bbc in london .
the british government , having received no reply ... to the ultimatums presented to the german government , has declared war on nazi germany .
ho ho !
that' s wonderful , wonderful !
it is expected
within the next few hours , france will make a similar declaration .
poland is no longer alone .
wonderful , wonderful !
mama , thatwas a great dinner .
yes , it certainly was .
when there' s something to celebrate , you' ve got to make an effort .
here' s to great britain and france .
i told you .
didn' t i tell you ?
all will be well !
oh !
five thousand and three .
huh ?
is that all ?
yes !
five thousand and three zlotys .
all we got left .
it' s 3, 003 zlotys too much .
look .
jews will be allowed to keep a maximum of 2, 000 zlotys in their homes .
what are we supposed to do with the rest ?
deposit it in a bank .
a blocked account .
banks ?
who' d be stupid enough to deposit money in a german bank ?
we could hide the money .
look here .
we can hide the money under the flowerpot .
no , we' il use tried and tested methods .
know what we did in the last war ?
eh ?
we made a hole in the table leg , and hid the money in there .
and suppose they take the table away ?
what , take the table away ?
the germans go into jewish homes and take what theywant .
furniture , valuables , anything .
idiot .
what would theywant with a table ?
a table like this ?
what on earth areyou doing ?
listen .
look .
this is the bestplace .
no one will think oflooking underthe flowerpot .
no , no , no .
listen .
i' ve been thinking .
really ?
that' s a change .
you know what we do ?
we use psychology .
we use what ?
we leave the money and the watch on the table .
and we cover it , in full view .
are you stupid ?
the germans will search high and low .
they' il never notice .
that' s the stupidest thing i' ve ever seen .
of course they' il notice it .
look here .
idiot .
and you call me stupid .
that is very good .
this will take hours !
we' re not in a hurry .
it won' t take hours .
how will you get them out ?
tell me that !
pull each one out individually !
no one listens to me .
quiet , please .
quiet !
order , order , please !
she' s a lawyer , she likes order .
just listen !
the watch we put under the flowerpots and the money we stuff in the violin .
will i still be able to play ?
well , you' il find out .
jurek ?
it' s wladek szpilman .
how are you ?
fine , fine .
we' re fine , thank you .
and you ?
fine .
we' re fine in the circumstances .
i guess what you called about there' s nothing we can do .
theywon' t reopen the station .
yes , i know .
but, jurek not even music .
nothing .
no radios for the poles .
jurek i' m sureyou' il find work , a pianist likeyou .
maybe , maybe not .
but
listen , don' t be offended , but i didn' t call to discuss my future career .
i nagged jurek forweeks and weeks .
at last he gave in and said , " all right , come with me tomorrow .
so i came , and they bombed the station .
meeting you like that was absolutelywonderful .
really ? .
yes .
it was it was unforgettable .
i' ve always loved your playing , mr. szpilman .
call me wladek , please .
no one plays chopin likeyou .
i hope that' s a compliment .
of course !
i mean it .
i know .
i was just trying to be funny .
shall we go to the paradiso , have a coffee ? .
i' d like that .
and you ? .
what doyou do ? .
i finished at the conservatoire .
you' re a musician !
yes .
what instrument i' m sorry .

oh .
i love to see a woman playing the cello .
here we are .
this is disgraceful !
how dare they !
you know what people are like .
theywant to be better nazis than hitler .
i' m going in there to complain .
no .
it' s better not , believe me .
it' s so humiliating , someone likeyou .
we' il find somewhere else .
we could walk in the park .
no , we can' t .
it' s an official decree .
nojews allowed in the park .
my god , areyou joking ? .
i' m not joking .
i' d suggest we sit on the bench .
but it' s another official decree .
nojews allowed on public benches .
this is absurd .
i' il tell you what we can do .
we can just stand here and talk .
i thinkwe' re allowed to do that , don' tyou ? .
soyou playthe cello , dorota .
that' s nice .
and who' s your favorite composer ?
chopin ?
really ?
you' il have to learn to play his cello sonata , won' t you ?
and what aboutyou , wladek ?? '
perhaps i can accompany you , me on the piano , you on the cello .
mr. szpilman , you are quite , quite wonderful .
call me wladek , please .
re . emblems forjews in the warsaw district .
i hereby order that all jews in the warsaw district ...
will wearvisible emblems when out of doors .
this decree will come into force on the 1 st of december , 1939 ,
and applies to all jews over 12 years ofage .
the emblem will be worn on the right sleeve ...
and will represent a blue star of david on a white background .
the background must be sufficiently large ...
for the star to measure eight centimeters from point to point .
the width of the arms of the star must be one centimeter .
jews who do not respect this decree will be severely punished .
governor of warsaw district ,
dr. fischer . '
i won' t wear it .
i won' t wear it .
i' m not going to be branded .
let let me see this .
doesn' t it say we have to provide these armbands ourselves ?
where will we get them ?
we' re not going to get them .
we' re not going to wear them .
have you seen this ?
what ?
what ?
i' m working .
what ?
what is it ?
it' s where they' re going to put us .
what do you mean , " put us " ?
by order of the governor of the warsaw district , dr. fischer ,
concerning the establishment of the jewish district in warsaw .
there will be created a jewish district in which all jews ...
iiving in warsaw or moving towarsaw will have to reside . '
look here .
jews living outside ofthe prescribed area ... will have to move to thejewish district by 31st ofoctober , 1940 . '
theywon' t get all of us .
it' s too small .
there' s 400, 000 of us in warsaw .
no .
360, 000 , so it' il be easy .
what am i supposed to do ?
you tell me what i do now .
mama ?
mama , what is it ?
twenty zlotys .
that' s all we have left , 20 zlotys .
what can i buy with 20 zlotys ? .
i am sick of cooking potatoes , potatoes , potatoes .
that' s the price .
that' s what i' m offering .
my advice is to accept .
you won' t get more from anyone else .
but it' s a bechstein , mr. lipa .
2, 000 ... and my advice is to take it .
what areyou gonna do whenyou' re hungry , eat the piano ?
get out , you dirty bastard !
what' s the matter with you ? .
we' d rather give it away !
go on , get out !

no , not really .
they arrested my cousin .
jurek says they' il let him out .
this is disgraceful .
it won' t last long .

it' s too absurd .
i , uh , i should

don' t worry about it .
they' re about to build a bridge .

then i' il tell you something funny .
do you all know who i mean by dr. raszeja ?
the surgeon ?
the surgeon .
for some reason don' t ask me why the germans allowed him into the ghetto to perform an operation .
on a jew ?
they allowed a pole to come in to operate on a jew ?
he got a pass .
that' s all i know .
anyway .
he puts the patient to sleep and starts the operation .
he' s just made the first incision when the ss burst in , shoot the patient on the table , then shoot dr. raszeja and everybody else who was there .
isn' t that a laugh ?
the patient didn' t feel a thing , he was anesthetized .
i said nothing bad , henryk .
what' s the matterwith you all ?
huh ?
huh ?
you lost your sense of humor ?
it' s not funny .
you know what' s funny ?
you' re funnywith that ridiculous tie .
what areyou talking about my tie for ?
what does my tie have to do with anything ?
i need this tie for my work .
your work ?
that' s right , i work .
yes .
playing the piano for the parasites in the ghetto .
parasites .
boys .
boys !
they don' t give a damn about people suffering .
you blame me for their apathy .
i do .
i see it every day .
they don' t even notice what' s going on around them .
i blame the americans .
forwhat ? .
for my tie ? .
american jews , and there are lots of' em .
what have they done for us ? .
what do they think they' re doing ? .
people here are dying , haven' t got a bite to eat .

i can look after myself .
they were taking you away .

that' s also my business .
hold it .
what' s the matter ?
what' s the matter ?
are you sick ?
hungry .
employment certificate ?
what' s that mean , no employment certificate ?
you have to have an employment certificate ... to work for one of the german firms in the ghetto , otherwise
otherwise , what ? .
you will be deported .
so the rumors are true .
they' re going to resettle us .
send us to labor camps in the east .
and they' re closing the small ghetto .
my god .
wladek ?
wladek ?
i thought you' d be off on tour playing london , paris , new york , chicago .
not this week .
you look terrible .
haveyou heard the rumors ?
they' re going to resettle us in the east .
rumors !
you take it all too much to heart .
what' s the trouble ?
i' ve been trying to get the certificate of employment for my father .
i' ve managed to get one for me and the rest of my family .
but i need another one for my father .
i' ve been to all the firms and shops .
why didn' tyou come to me ?
i didn' t knowyou were in the certificate business .
i' m not , but majorek is .
can you help ?
i have no money .
please , don' t insult us .
can you do something for him ?

that' s the historical imperative in action .
that' s why i always say , look on the bright side .

du .

i thought the certificates would save us .
stop it , wladek !
let' s just hope that henryk and halina will be better off .
where will we be going ?
you' re going to work .
you' il be much better off than in this stinking ghetto .
move .
why did i do it ?
why did i do it , huh ?
why did i do it ?
why did i do it ?
why did i do it ?
why did i do it ?
why did i do it ?

i beg you .
i beg you .
don' t you have a drop of water ?
i beg you .
can you hear what i' m saying ?
i' m telling you it' s a disgrace !
i can hear you !
we let them take us to our death like sheep to the slaughter .
not so loud .
why don' t we attack them ?
there' s half a million of us here .
we could break out of the ghetto .
at least we could die honorably , not as a stain on the face of history .
why areyou so sure they' re sending us to our death ?
i' m not sure !
you know why i' m not sure ?
because they didn' t tell me .
they' re gonna wipe us all out .
what do you want me to do ?
do you want me to fight ?
to fight you need organization
he' s right .
what doyou think i can do , fight them with my violin bow ?
the germans will never squander a huge labor force like this .
they' re sendi ng us to a labor camp .
i t' s obvious .
oh , sure !
look at that cripple there .
look at the old people , the children .
they' re gonna work ?
look at you ?
you gonna carry iron girders on your back ?

why did i do it ?
she' s getting on my nerves .
what did she do , for god' s sake ?
she smothered her baby .
they prepared a hiding place , so , of course , they went there .
but the baby cried just as the police came .
she smothered the cries with her hands .
the baby died .
a policeman heard the death rattle , found where they were hiding .
mama .
what are you reading ?
if you prick us , do we not bleed ?
if you tickle us , do we not laugh ?
if you poison us , do we not die ?
and if you wrong us , shall we not revenge ?? '

achtung !
how long have you been here ?
since last night .
i was pleased to see you .
they' re going to start a final resettlement now .
we know what it means .
we sent someone out zygmunt .
a good man .
his orders were to follow the trains out of warsaw .
he got to sokolow .
a local railway man told him the tracks divided , one branch leading to treblinka .
he said every day freight trains carrying people from warsaw ... branched offto treblinka and returned empty .
no transports offood are everseen on that line .
and civilians ... are forbidden to approach the treblinka station .
they' re exterm i nati ng us .
it won' t take them long .
we' re 60, 000 left out ofhalfa million .
mostly young people .
and this time we' re gonna fight .
we' re in good shape , organized .
we' re prepared .
