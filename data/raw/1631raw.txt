i used to believe when you threw money in , it turned into your wish .
i' il take two of your coins .
that' s not fair .
wait , wait , wait , you can' t do this .
why ?
because these are somebody else' s wishes .
they' re somebody else' s dreams .
yeah , but you know what ?
this one , this one right here ... ... this was my dream , my wish .
and it didn' t come true .
so i' m taking it back .
i' m taking them all back .
come on , one eyed willy , what does this have to do with the map ?
is this another one of your tricks ?
maybe we should keep him alive in case he isn' t lying .
