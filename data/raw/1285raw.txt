and once you' re free .

when you' re kidnapped , your husband will call the police .
if not at first , then definitely after you get home .
we need a dose of reality to make it convincing .
reality ?
yes .
besides , i don' t want to get caught by the cops either .

you go ahead .
make sure no one sees you go in .
and you , handyman ?
i got stuff to do .
ok .
l`il make the first call now .
yes .
let' s go over a few details .
yes .
komiyama saori was abducted near " l " and confined somewhere .
always remember that premise .
yes .
that where , is of course not here .
meaning you leave no evidence of having been here .
yes .
first , don' t go touching anything .
yes .
second , keep the curtains shut , like this .
yes .
when you need a light , use this .
yes .
and obviously , don' t answer the phone or the door .
of course you stay inside .
keep it locked up .
yes .
and no feeding those fish either .
what ?
listen .
you' ve been kidnapped .
how can you feed the fish ?
but they' il die , then .
who matters more , you or the fish ?
i understand .
next , the hostage life , 101 .
101 ?
first , no baths .
or showers .
no showers ?
of course not .
not even my face ?
listen , lady .
if you want the story to fly , you need actions , not just words .
i`m sorry .
also , only eat the food i brought .
don' t touch any of her food .
i understand .
it' il be rough , but that' s the deal .
yes .
and there' s one more thing .
while you were being held , your hands and feet were tied .
yes .
you have to tie me ?
it' il be more realistic if your hands and feet are bruised .
put on the others .
yes .
i' m ready .
i' il get rid of these clothes .
all right ?
yes .
i' il tie you up now .
you' ve got to bear it .
yes .
you see how i did it ?
i guess .
undo it to go to the bathroom , but tie yourself back up again .
i understand .
your wrists , too .
it doesn' t have to be so tight .
you want to be able to untie it .
yes .
try it .
pull this through here .
and tie it like this .
yes .
pull it with your teeth .
what are you doing ?
you' re defenseless , aren' t you , lady ?
what ?
i always wanted to fuck someone tied up .
we' re not playing anymore .
get it ?
please ... don' t ...
this is shinko enterprises .
hello .
this is sato from meiwa bank .
we always appreciate your business .
is the president in ?
please hold .
now this is what you call reality , lady .
i' il call when i get back .
but i can' t answer the phone .
i' il ring 3 times , hang up , then 3 times again .
you unlock the door .
i' il call when i' m close .
three rings , and then another three rings .
lady .
a mistake to answer the phone .
who is this ?
who cares .
you ?
you did this ?
it' s your fault , mr. kidnapper .
why' d you do it ?
it just happened .
that' s no reason .
look who' s talking .
you snatched her liberty .
no .
she asked me to stage a kidnapping .
that' s all .
you tied her up to stage a kidnapping ?
it' s the truth .
she asked me to kidnap her .
huh .
i wonder if the cops will buy that .
i need a favor .
what ?

what ?
i don' t like loose ends .
