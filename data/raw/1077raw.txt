hello , emergency .
what service did you require , please ?
hello , quick , anybody , just get help !
where are you calling from , sir ?
kaihoro , phone box .
there was this roaring noise and a big white light in the sky ... and then ... these ... invaders started killing us !
hold on sir , i' il connect you with the internal affairs dpt .
no time , they' re after me ...
hello ?
aaaargh !
is there anybody there ?
what do you think , minister ?
call a full scale invasion alert , sir .
i' il phone the forces , fighters frigates , footsloggers ...
perhaps that could all be a bit showy .
i think this is a job for real men .
just stop right there !
stop !
i think you' d better kill him , barry .
jeez , he could be ministry or works ...
no , he' s moving too fast .
stop !
this is definitely your last chance !
that' s the story !
i always thought you were left handed .
no , the head shot' s the only true stopper .
ugh ...
aw jeez !
i hope i' m not the poor bastard that' s got to clean that up .
jesus !
stick all the bits of brain in a plastic bag , barry .
we' il need them for analysis .
no bloody way mate .
come down here and do that yourself .
you' re the yung ho scientist .
all right .
i' il be down straight after lunch .
but at least take a blood sample .
no need .
i' il just wring my strides out .
well , at least we got one live specimen .
yeah .
seen anyone else about , barry ?
no , the place is completely deserted .
they' re probably all dead , that' s at least 75 people .
jeez , i just hope we' re in time to save the world .
well , i just hope you got it right this time .
no doubt about it barry .
i' ve been watching the skies .
and do you know what the skies did ?
they pointed ...
they pointed at this place .
why can' t aliens be friendly ?
there' s no glowing fingers on these bastards .
we' ve got a bunch of extra terrestrial psychopaths on our hands .
like a ... visit from a planet full of charlie mansons .
they' ve wiped out a small town for starters .
it' s my guess they' il go on to something bigger next time .
christchurch , wellington ...
auckland ?
yeah , well that wouldn' t be so bad .
well you' d better contact the others , derek .
they should be in range now .
tell them to keep an eye out ... for someone who could be heading this way .
who ?
a collector .
there' s some appeal on .
there' s envelopes stuck on all the doors ... and today' s collection day .
hey !
there' s something that' s just occurred to me too , mate .
what' s that ?
that joker you topped a while back .
he might have friends .
i' d keep my eyes skinned if i were you .
you needn' t worry .
i' m not stupid , thanks ...
come in frank .
ozzy , are you there ?
boys , are you there ?
turn it down , ozzy !
that' s elevator music for headbangers .
frank !
ozzy !
are you there ?
yeah , we' re here mate , but could you use the proper call sign ?
there could be people listening .
there' s nobody for miles , frank .
besides , i don' t think whispering' s going to help .
he' s got a point there , frank .
what do you mean , nobody for miles ?
i thought you were in kaihoro
i am in kaihoro and i was right all long .
they' ve done the entire town .
who' s done the town ?
the extra terrestrial low lifers .
and guess what !
we' ve caught one of the bastards !
me and barry got him loping over the hills ... just like he owned the bloody place .
huh ?
now do you believe me ?
jeez , look derek , just keep him there .
you got him secured ?
bloody oath !
right , now don' t touch him .
we' il be there in 45 minutes .
whatever you do , don' t harm him .
no physical violence !
another thing , derek , keep a careful look out .
there could be more about .
there was !
down on the beach !
hell , well look .
don' t go near him .
it' s a little late for that , frank .
what ?
it wasn' t me .
barry shot his head off .
he had the magnum .
i knew it was a mistake to issue weapons .
we' re a government department , not a para military unit .
the astro investigation and defence service .
wish they change that name !
due to the potentially dangerous hazards involved ...
all right , at least you managed to convince the minister .
aren' t you interested in this joker we caught then ?
course we are , derek .
right .
stay where you are and i' il give you an eye witness description ... of this inter galactic wanker .
well , i' d describe him as sort of human shaped .
he' s got jeans and a blue shirt on .
christ , he' s nabbed a bloody farmer !
yeah , but there' s something strange about him .
like he' s got a screw loose or something .
it' s a bloody farmer !
yeah , derek strikes again !
is this another false alarm like the manners street invasion alert ?
how do you explain the disappearance of an entire township then , frank ?
the kiwi jonestown , of course , that' s it .
drinking beer laced with cyanide from little polystyrene cups .
yeah , yeah , ok .
derek , just do me one favour .
what ?
try not to make him extinct before we get there .
out !
christ , what a dork !
how the hell did he get in this team ?
well , this has buggered your plans for conquering the universe , eh ?
my friend the astro bastard .
time for talkies .
by the time my colleagues get here ...
i want to have you babbling in some extra terrestrial language .
now in case you don' t want to do what you' re told ...
i could always encourage you by hammering this cold steel ... into your fibula .
it' il sure poke a nasty hole in your marrow , mate .
we' il get the old ball rolling , eh ?
now , what are you dirty hooers doing on my planet ?
oh , bugger it !
well , looks as if it' s time for the old count of ten .
one ...
two ...
three ...
six ...
seven , eight ...
nine ...
ten .
derek !
derek !
derek !
come in , derek !
what ?
aw jeez !
oh , i should have expected that .
derek !
all right !
quickly derek !
come on !
jeez barry , you' ve got awful timing .
what ?
just listen to me .
you' ve got to get out of there fast !
five of those blue shirted freaks are coming up .
they heard their mate screaming .
get out of there fast derek .
i can' t do that .
i' m a derek .
dereks don' t run .
well , get up a tree or something .
yeah , look don' t worry .
i' ve taken precautions .
oh , shit !
shit !
bastards !
eat lead sucker !
mammy !
i think this is going a little bit over the top , ozzy .
nah , this' il do the trick .
nobody' il be coming up this road .
but the nearest nuclear reactor' s in america .
but it could have been an explosion on one of those springbok warships .
frank !
ozzy !
frank !
ozzy !
come in !
yeah , what is it barry ?
jeez you guys we' re in trouble this time .
it' s really hit the fan .
derek' s wiped out five of these alien jokers .
the place is like a bloody abattoir .
where' s derek now ?
well , he' s ... he' s turned his toes up , guys .
took a dive off the bloody cliff .
he' s popped his rivets .
poor derek !
who' s going to look after his aviary now ?
yeah , birds were the only thing he could relate to .
right , we' il be there in about fifteen minutes .
no , i think it' il be best if you stay where you are .
just get the car off the road until i call you back .
i' m going to head off in the direction that alien joker was going ... when me and derek caught him .
he must have been going somewhere .
they' ve probably got a base up there or something .
they don' t need a base .
they beam down from their spaceship .
well maybe they haven' t seen star trek , ozzy .
come on !
shit !
bye , bye !
that' s my overtime up to date .
here , do you want to do yours ?
hey , frank !
yeah , what is it barry ?
where exactly are you two ?
about five miles from kaihoro .
yeah well just stay put .
i think i might have spotted something and i' m moving in closer .
finished , oz ?
oh , shit !
uh , your phone ...
could i use your phone ?
i was just ...
i was ...
we' ve got trouble .
good one !
right , we' re on our way .
i suppose you' re wondering why you' re soaking ... in reg' s eleven secret herbs and spices .
tomorrow we' re having you for lunch .
you are the exotic new taste sensation .
human flesh is it !
you' re going to be the first bit of meat that we' ve had a chance ... to get our teeth into since we arrived .
so we' re going to treat ourselves to a feast ... with you as the main course .
it' s quite an honour really .
we' d better leave so he can get some sleep .
i' il have the head , reg .
i want to suck his brains out .
we ought to go back to get reinforcements .
that' il take a day .
and the rest !
take two days to do the bloody paperwork .
yeah , and by then that collector bloke could be dead .
if he' s not really .
look , we' il go in .... after midnight .
well , guess i' il have to issue a gun to ozzy .
yeah , but don' t forget about his personality disorder .
open season on e. t. s , frank ?
remember ozzy ...
get in quietly , get out quietly .
i certainly hope that is the case .
sorry , oz .
we won' t be needing that .
bloody barry !
bastard !
what are we going to do if we' re spotted , frank ?
well , i guess we shoot the bastards .
my turn to the magnum .
i just wish we didn' t have to wear all this crap .
yeah but you know what the rules are .
when we work undercover we have to remain faceless .
oh i get it , just in case we kill a lot of innocent people .
don' t you forget , we' re only authorised to use violence ... when there' s a threat to the planet earth .
and the moon !
and the moon !
there you go , oz .
stick this stuff on .
we ought to have a look around .
if these are aliens , they might have parked their spaceship .
they might have come in a telephone box .
well let' s just get that guy out and will contact base ... and give them the code words for invasion .
the bastards have landed .
the bastards have landed .
i' il be there in a moment , robert .
welcome my friends .
the job is almost done .
we take off for home tomorrow .
i' m sure you' il be pleased to be leaving this shitty planet .
in the meantime i must impress upon you the importance ... of remaining in human form ... no matter how awkward , uncomfortable and ugly it makes you feel .
we are so close to success that we must take no chances .
right .
looks pretty quiet .
probably all gone to bed .
jeez , i hope not .
right , synchronise watches .
twelve oh one .
check .
check .
let' s go .
we' re on triple time .
the sad news is that we will be heading for nalic nod ... with six of our co workers in a state of permanent death .
they died today , murdered by some real arse holes .
robert escaped their clutches and reported back to me .
my god !
what the ... ?
my god ... the blood !
shit !
somebody could get killed in here .
vacuum the floors , clean the windows and ... all the boxes must be loaded into the freezer early in the morning .
we' ve been wasting our time unless we can present samples ... to the nalic nod fast food authority .
isn' t it amazing how you can fit a whole town of humans ... into a few card of board boxes , if you slice off the fat ?
it' s the value of keeping your knife sharp and your mind clean .
jesus guys , derek was right !
this is what' s left of the people from kaihoro .
they' re in those boxes !
get him , barry !
for god' s sake guys , keep it quiet !
shut him up , oz .
i' ve just cleaned that bit .
uh , that' s gross !
gee !
they come to bits easy !
get rid of it !
the old magic' s still there .
what are you doing frank ?
i' m going to go in and find out what' s going on .
here , he was carrying this .
you , stay here .
... the importance of keeping the bloody books up to date .
the past week has been difficult ... and i would like to say how proud i am of you all .
the manner in which you conducted a very tricky slaughter operation ... has been a real credit to you and indeed ... to the whole crumb' s crunchy delights organisation .
your paychecks will reflect the gratitude of the company .
i don' t think we' il have any more trouble .
however ... we will be handing these around later .
i am certain that ... when the homo sapiens taste takes the galaxy by storm as it will ..
crumb' s crunchy delights will be back at the top .
mcyaballow' s fried moonrat won' t know what hit them .
all the livestock we need are right here .
four billion of them !
right , robert .
once the fast food authority have checked the samples ... and issued the mass slaughter permits ... this grotty little planet will tremble ... under the full might of the lord crumb restaurant chain !
within a year the giant mincer will descend from the sky ... the sun reflecting from its silver bits ... and no army on earth will be able to stop ... the noddy burger machine !
i see the gruel is ready !
an exquisite bouquet , robert .
aren' t i lucky , i got a chunky bit !
here you are , boys .
we' il bring out a whole line ... of homo sapiens low calorie delicacies ... juicy raw rump ... brains soaked in lemon juice ... spinal fluid sauce ... assorted organ stew ... sapien burguers ... and chewy homo nuggets .
just before we leave tomorrow ... we' il have a little party dinner with fresh local meat .
it' s my show of appreciation to you all .
christ , you' il never believe what i just had to do !
did you have to drink some chuck ?
come on , let' s find that guy and get out of here .
goodnight , boys .
goodnight , reg .
oh , robert , what a lovely little hottie !

careful !
thanks .

well , at least we got in quietly .
stay here !

split up !
send the boy up here !
come on !
how many did you see ?
about eight or nine .

where the hell' s barry ?

oh , shit !
jeez !

right , let' s go out of here .
what the hell is that ?
well it sounds to me like ...
oh shut up , codpiece face !

the rest of you get these bodies on board the ship .
jeez , they' re real dickheads !
derek was right all along .
get him , oz !

just go to the nearest phone and call head office .
hi , my name' s giles copeland .
yeah , i' m barry , let' s go .
that' s the end of those weekend cowboys !
let' s go home .
dum dum dum ...

that' s an historical homestead !
yeah , i know it .
i' ve got another one here , too .
wankers !
for god' s sake , oz , put that thing down .
let' s get in there and hit the leader .
hey , wait for me !

mummy !

but then these pricks tried to take us on ... but we soon fixed them ...

i' m born again !
