no , there' s no water , dad .
it' s all gone , since this morning .
i wanted to rinse my hands , too .
all gone .
is it still warm ?
i' ve got the sniffles this morning !
it must have been the dampness on the boat .
i only have to set foot on that boat
perhaps i' m allergic .
even if the boat' s not moving , the dampness gets to me .
i don' t know how you can stay on it all night ... and not catch a thing .
the minute i get on
i' ve received a postcard from america , dad ... from gaetano and alfredo .
this is america around the outside ... and this is an american car .
they say they' re going to buy one , too .
we' re buying one .
but i think they' re joking ... because they cost a ioad of money .
but they say it' s a rich country ... where there' s work , a country
and we' re still here ... without water ... while they' re
forget it , never mind .
listen , mario , you' ve never like fishing .
i' ve caught a chill .
go to america or japan if you want to ... but get yourself a job .
you' re not a kid anymore .
the poet , pablo neruda , in rome .
centrai station .
a group of rowdy people has inconvenienced the travellers ... who crowd the station platforms every day .
these protesters ... are not drunkards ... nor the usuai hotheads who protest just for the fun of it .
they are a group of intellectuals , writers and journallsts .
why have they joined together , shouting ... disturbing the pollce and carabinieri ?
the mystery is revealed when the train arrives .
pablo neruda gets out at rome station ... the chilean poet known throughout the world for his poetry ... and his communist ideas which have often got him into trouble ... and for which he has now been exiled .
the poet appears to be well loved in italy ... and , judging by the enthusiastic embrace of this woman ... not only for his morai gifts .
women go crazy for his poetry ... maybe because neruda writes love poems ... a topic which appeals to the female sensibility .
but iet' s go back to our noisy crowd .
the home office has accepted their protest ... by suspending the measures against neruda ... requested by the chilean government .
the poet will remain in italy ... on a wonderfui island .
he will not be able to ieave without pollce authority ... but the island' s beauty will make exile easier .
that' s me !
the poet will have happy memories of italy and her government ... which is hosting him in a place which will remind him of home .
this cozy house surrounded by nature ... will certainly make him feei at home .
temporary postman with bicycle
you , anita scotto , are the sender .
this is your son' s name , right ?
i' ve come about the job .
right , wait .

everyone else there is ililterate .
i' m not ililterate , but still
well , then .
it' s all mall for signor pablo neruda .
the poet loved by women ?
the poet loved by the people !
by the people , but also by women .
i heard it on the newsreel .
all right , but most of all by the people .
he' s a communist .
right ?
the poet has received a mountain of mall these iast two days .
pedalling with the bag is like carrying an elephant on your back .
i' il wait here .
i' il be right with you .
the wage is a pittance , you know .
postmen make do with their tips .
but with only one house ... at most it' il pay for your cinema once a week .
that' s fine .
it suits you anyway .
my name' s giorgio .
i' m your superior , and you should call me sir .
but i won' t hold you to it , because i' m a communist , too .
and remember ... the poet ... is a great and kind person .
he deserves respect .
you say hello , you thank him .
if he tips you , you thank him again .
right ?
yes , right .
this is your hat .
this is your bag .
today' s the 15th .
your first payday' s the 27th .
when do you start ?
monday morning .
6 : 45 , i open the shutters .
then the pubilc comes iater .
are you in uniform already ?
no , i' m just wearing the hat .
that way it' il take its shape better ... or i' il get a headache wearing it all day .
the boss told me it' s a postman' s trick .
a llttle trick of ours .
good morning .
your mall .
thank you .
another one from a female .
female .
maria conchita , female .
angela , female .
jean marie , is that male or female ?
female !
i knew it !
this one , too .
even the women are interested in polltics in chile !
i know , but all females
how come ?
listen ... but what' s don pablo ...
like ?
is he normal ?
as a person , as
normal .
of course , he talks differently .
you can tell immediately from
know what he calls his wife ?
amor " !
even if he' s standing far away ... they call each other " amor .
really ?
he' s a poet .
that' s how you can tell .
female .
excuse me ... if you happen to need anything ... milk , bread , i can
no , thank you .
matilde goes shopping every day .
if ever she doesn' t want to go out , you can ask me .
i come and go .
we don' t need anything .
thanks anyway .
i mean , if by any chance
and remember , mario ... you mustn' t bother him with a iot of questions .
it' s forbidden to annoy customers with strange requests .
i know , i won' t annoy him .
i' il only ask him to sign this book , that' s all .
so when i get paid , i' il go to naples ... and show all the girls ... that i' m a friend of neruda , the poet of iove !
the poet of the people !
excuse me , could you sign it ?
please , could you sign it ?
would you make it unique , maestro ?
would you make it unique , maestro ?
my name' s mario ruoppolo .
and my mall ?
there isn' t any .
come on , mario , you should be happy .
happy ?
i told him quite clearly , mario ruoppolo .
regards , pablo neruda .
it means nothing .
you don' t think he can cross it out and write it better ... so you can see it' s for me , that we' re friends ?
do you think he' d cross it out because you don' t like it ... and write you another ?
perhaps he did it on purpose because you bothered him .
no , i asked him .
he was staring at the mountain .
exactly , you see ?
no , i know the mountain ... but he was holding an onion .
so you think a poet can' t think when he' s holding an onion , eh ?
when am i supposed to ask him then ... if i can' t ask him when he' s peellng an onion ?
he' s a busy man .
he can' t be running after people to make them happy .
yes , but he' s a communist .
so what ?
didn' t you say that communists love the people ?
mario , don' t make me annoyed !
i bought a copy of the book .
when you have the chance ... with extreme tact ... ask him if he would sign it for me .
sign it ?
take this one then .
regards , pablo neruda .
no , this is yours .
he signed it for you .
i' m happy to iet you have it .
no !
mr. di cosimo , shall i empty all the water ?
all of it , all of it .
' morning .
mr. di cosimo ... what can i do to thank you ?
your wreath was the nicest .
nothing , donna rosa .
just vote and get others to vote .
remember to use that llttle pencil of yours .
and hopefully some of your customers will , too . " ... happens that i go into the tallors ' shops and the movies ... all shriveled up ... impenetrable , like a felt swan ... navigating on a water of origin and ash .
the smell of barber shops makes me sob out ioud ...
i am tired of being a man ...
mall .
what' s the matter ?
don pablo ?
you' re standing as stiff as a post !
nalled like a spear ?
no , immobile like the castle on a chess board .
stiller than a porcelain cat .
elementary odes isn' t the only book i' ve written .
i' ve written much better .
it' s unfair of you to shower me with similes and metaphors .
don pablo ?
metaphors .
what are those ?
metaphors ?
metaphors are how can i explain ?
when you talk of something , comparing it to another .
is it something ... you use in poetry ?
yes , that too .
for example ?
for example ... when you say , " the sky weeps , " what do you mean ?
that it' s raining .
yes , very good .
that' s a metaphor .
it' s easy then !
why has it got such a compilcated name ?
man has no business with ... the simpilcity or complexity of things .
excuse me , don pablo , then i' il go .
the smell of barber shops makes me sob out ioud .
is that a metaphor , too ?
no ... not exactly .
i am tired of being a man .
that' s happened to me , too ... but i never knew how to say it .
i really liked it when i read it .
why " the smell of barber shops makes me sob " ?
you see , mario ...
i can' t tell you ... in words different from those i' ve used .
when you explain it , poetry becomes banal .
better than any explanation ... is the experience of feellngs that poetry can reveal ... to a nature open enough to understand it .
will you open this , please ?
who , me ?
yes .
shall i open it ?
yes !
my hands are dirty .
it' s written in
it' s foreign .
is it more important than the others ?
yes , it' s from sweden .
what' s so speciai about sweden ?
the nobei prize for literature .
a prize then ?
if they give it to me , i won' t refuse .
why ?
how much money is it ?
171, 135 swedish krona .
i' ve no idea , is that a iot ?
lots and iots !
then you' il get it .
there are candidates with a better chance than me this year .
why ?
because they' ve written important works .
no ... you' il get it , i' m sure .
thank you .
shall i open the other ietters ?
no , i' il read them iater .
are they love ietters ?
what a question !
don' t iet matilde hear you .
i' m sorry , don pablo .
i only meant
i' d like to be a poet , too .
no , it' s more originai being a postman .
you get to walk a iot and don' t get fat .
we poets are all fat .
yes , but ... with poetry ...
i could make women fall for me .
how
how do you become a poet ?
try and walk slowly along the shore as far as the bay ... and iook around you .
and will they come to me , these metaphors ?
certainly .
mario , can you send someone to see about this problem of water ?
have you got water ?
no , that' s exactly the problem .
that' s no problem at all !
why ?
is it normal ?
it' s normal .
you' ve run out of water ... up at the cistern .
do you use a iot of water ?
no , just what i need .
then that' s too much .
because ... it runs out all of a sudden because the water supply ship ... comes only once a month , so the water gets used up .
we' ve got they' ve been saying we' il get running water ... for ages .
you' il have running water . " but
and you don' t protest ?
what do we say ?
my father swears every so often ... but ... only to himself .
there are people who , with a strong will , manage to change things .
it' s a pity .
this place is so beautiful !
think so ?
yes .
sit down .
here on the island , the sea ... so much sea .
it spills over from time to time .
it says yes , then no ... then no .
in blue , in foam , in a gallop ... it says no , then no .
it cannot be still .
my name is sea , it repeats ... striking a stone but not convincing it .
then with the seven green tongues of seven green tigers ... of seven green seas ... it caresses it , kisses it , wets it ... and pounds on its chest , repeating its own name .
well ?
what do you think ?
it' s weird .
what do you mean , weird ?
you' re a severe critic .
no , not your poem .
weird ...
weird ... how i felt while you were saying it .
how was that ?
i don' t know .
the words went back and forth .
like the sea then ?
exactly .
like the sea .
there , that' s the rhythm .
i felt seasick , in fact .
because ...
i can' t explain it .
i felt like ...
like a boat tossing around on those words .
like a boat tossing around on my words ?
do you know what you' ve done , mario ?
no , what ?
you' ve invented a metaphor .
yes , you have !
really ?
but it doesn' t count because i didn' t mean to .
meaning to is not important .
images arise spontaneously .
you mean then that ... for example , i don' t know if you follow me ... that the whole world ... the whole world , with the sea , the sky ... with the rain , the clouds
now you can say etc . , etc .
etc . , etc .
the whole world is the metaphor for something else ?
i' m talking crap .
no , not at all .
not at all .
you pulled a strange face .
mario , iet' s make a pact .
i' il have a nice swim ... and ponder your question .
then i' il give you an answer tomorrow .
really ?
yes , really .
don pablo , good morning .
i' ve got to talk to you .
it must be very important .
you' re snorting like a horse .
it' s very important .
i' ve fallen in iove .
nothing serious .
there' s a remedy .
no , no remedy !
i don' t want a remedy .
i want to stay sick .
i' m in iove , really , really in iove .
who are you in love with ?
her name' s beatrice .
dante .
dante allghieri .
he fell for a certain beatrice .
beatrices have inspired boundless iove .
what are you doing ?
writing down the name dante .
dante i know , but allghieri
has it got an " h " in it ?
wait , i' il write it for you .
thank you .
i' m madly in iove .
you' ve already told me that , but what can i do about it ?
i don' t know , if you can help
but i' m an old man .
i don' t know , because ...
i suddenly saw her in front of me .
i stared at her , but i couldn' t utter a word .
what , you didn' t say anything to her ?
not much .
i watched her and fell in iove .
just like that ?
in a flash ?
no , i stared at her for ten minutes first .
and she ?
and she said ...
what' s up , never seen a woman before ?
what' s your name ?
beatrice russo .
and you ?
i couldn' t think of anything to say .
nothing at all ?
you didn' t say a word ?
not exactly nothing .
i said five words to her .
which were ?
i said , " what' s your name ?
and she ?
beatrice russo .
what' s your name ? " are three words .
and the other two ?
then i repeated beatrice russo .
don pablo , if
i don' t want to bother you , but ... can you write me a poem for beatrice ?
i don' t even know her !
a poet needs to know the object of his inspiration !
i can' t invent something out of nothing .
i' ve got this llttle ball ... which beatrice put in her mouth .
she' s touched it .
so what ?
it might help you .
look , poet ... if you make all this fuss over one poem ... you' re never going to win that nobei prize !
mario , pinch me and wake me from this nightmare !
what am i supposed to do ?
no one else can help me .
they' re all fishermen here !
what am i supposed to do ?
fishermen fall in iove , too !
they are able to talk to the girls they iove ... to make them fall in iove , too , and marry them .
what does your father do ?
he' s a fisherman .
naturally !
he must have spoken to your mother to get her to marry him .
i don' t think so .
he doesn' t talk much .
come on , give me my mall .
thank you , but i don' t want it .
do you want something else ?
no , thanks .
beatrice , your smile spreads like a butterfly .
fallen out of bed this morning ?
i came eariler because ...
i saw this .
it iooks important .
you' re right , it is important .
and then ... there' s something else ...
i' ve been meaning to give you but kept forgetting .
i' il put it here .
good bye .
wait a minute .
i' ve got something for you , too .
here .
it might be usefui for your metaphors .
is it a radio ?
no , but it' s a kind of radio .
you speak into here ... and this repeats what you say .
you speak into it and it repeats what you say ?
yes .
how many times ?
as many times as you want .
but you mustn' t exaggerate .
even the most subilme idea seems foollsh if heard too often .
listen .
good news ?
when i was senator of the repubilc ...
i went to visit pampa ... a region where it only rains once every 50 years ... where llfe is unimaginably hard .
i wanted to meet the people who had voted for me .
one day ... at lota , there was a man who had come up from a coai mine .
he was a mask of coai dust and sweat ... his face ... contorted by terrible hardship ... his eyes red from the dust .
wherever you go ... speak of this torment .
speak of your brother who llves underground ... in hell .
i felt i had to write something to help man in his struggle ... to write the poetry of the mistreated .
that' s how " canto general " came about .
now my comrades ... tell me they have managed to get it pubilshed secretly in chile ... and it' s selling like hot cakes .
that makes me very happy .
my dear comrades ... ... i have recently listened to your recording and it has made very happy .
i was very pleased to have a book published in chile .
now i want you to listen to a man who has become ... ... my dearest friend here mario ruoppolo .
i told them i' m here with a friend who wishes to say hello .
and tell them something nice about this beautifui country .
yes .
good morning .
no , in there .
something nice about the island ?
yes , one of the wonders of your island .
now iet' s go to the inn ... and meet this famous beatrice russo .
are you joking ?
no , i' m serious .
let' s have a iook at this girlfriend .
mamma mia !
pablo neruda and mario ruoppolo at the inn .
she' il faint !
well ?
what is it now ?
don pablo , when i get married to beatrice russo ... will you be my best man ?
listen ... first iet' s have a drink , then we' il decide .
gennarino , wait !
i' m coming , too !
domenico , come here or i' il thrash you !
look who' s here .
neruda !
good morning .
what will it be ?
a glass of red wine , please .
and the pinball king ?
do you want red wine , too ?
red wine , yes .
two glasses of red wine and a pen to write with .
he' s here for your niece .
give me the notebook .
notebook ?
why ?
just a moment .
to mario , my intimate friend and comrade pablo neruda
there you are .
you already have your poetry .
if you want to write it down , here' s your notebook .
thank you .
what is it ?
go home .
it' s closing time !
i won' t make you pay for the bottle , but go home .
we' re closing .
what are you doing ?
i' m thinking .
with the window open ?
yes , with the window open .
be honest with me .
what did he tell you ?
metaphors .
metaphors ?
never heard such big words from you before .
what metaphors did he do to you ?
did ?
he said them !
he said my smile spreads across my face like a butterfly .
and then ?
i iaughed when he said that .
your iaugh is a rose ... a spear unearthed , crashing water .
your iaugh is a sudden silvery wave .
then what did you do ?
i kept quiet .
and he ?
what else did he say ?
no , what did he do ?
your postman , as well as a mouth , has two hands !
he never touched me .
he said he was happy to be next to a pure young woman .
like being on the shores of the white ocean .
i like it
i like it when you' re silent ... because it' s as though you' re absent .
and you ?
and he ?
he iooked at me , too , then he stopped iooking at my eyes ... and began to iook at my hair ... without a word , as though he were thinking .
enough , my child !
when a man starts to touch you with words ... he' s not far off with his hands .
there' s nothing wrong with words .
words are the worst things ever .
i' d prefer a drunkard at the bar touching your bum ... to someone who says , " your smile files like a butterfly " !
it " spreads " like a butterfly !
files , spreads , it' s the same thing !
just iook at you !
one stroke of his finger , and you' re on your back .
you' re wrong .
he' s a decent person .
when it comes to bed , there' s no difference ... between a poet , a priest or even a communist !
naked ... you are as simple as one of your hands ... smooth , terrestrial , tiny ... round , transparent .
you have moon ilnes , apple paths .
naked , you are as thin as bare wheat .
naked , you are blue like a cuban night .
there are vines and stars in your hair .
naked , you are enormous and yellow ...
like summer in a gilded church .
good morning , father .
i found this in her brassiere .
i want you to read it to me .
i' m not ietting her out of the house for now .
well ?
it' s a poem .
read it to me !
naked ...
madonna !
what are the nets like ?
mario , i need an adjective .
nets which nets ?
fishing nets ?
yes .
sad .
sad .
all right ?
good morning , signora .
would you like  yes .
please , sit down .
no .
what i want to say is too serious to say sitting down .
what is it about ?
for over a month ...
mario ruoppolo has been hanging around my inn ... and he has seduced my niece .
what did he say ?
metaphors .
well ?
he' s heated her up like an oven with his metaphors .
a man whose only capitai is the fungus between his toes !
and if his feet are full of germs , his mouth is full of spells .
her smile was like a butterfly .
but now he' s saying her breast is like a fire with two flames .
but do you think ... that these images are only his imagination or that
yes , i think he' s had his hands on her .
read this .
it was in her brassiere .
naked
as beautifui as
naked , you' re as dellcate as nights on an island ... and stars in your hair
it' s beautiful !
so he' s seen my niece naked !
no , signora rosa !
nothing in this poem ieads us to think that .
the poem' s telling the truth .
my niece naked is just as the poem describes her .
so do me a favor and tell mario ruoppolo ... who' s iearnt a iot from you ... that he must never see my niece again for the rest of his llfe .
and tell him that if he does , i' il shoot him .
is that clear ?
yes .
good day .
you' re as white as a sack of flour .
i might be white outside , but inside i' m red .
you won' t save yourself from the widow' s fury with adjectives .
if she harms me , she' il go to jall .
she' il be out in a couple of hours .
she' il say she acted out of self defense .
she' il say you threatened the virginity of her damsel : with a metaphor hissing like a dagger ... as sharp as a canine , as iacerating as a hymen .
the poetry will have ieft the mark of its seditious sallva ... on the virgin' s nipples .
the poet francois villon was hung from a tree for much iess ... and his blood gushed from his neck like roses .
i don' t care .
she can do what she wants .
i' m ready .
good iad !
it' s a reai shame we haven' t got ... a trio of guitarists to go ...
my dear poet and comrade ... you got me into this mess , you' ve got to get me out of it .
you gave me books to read ... you taught me to use my tongue for more than llcking stamps .
it' s your fault if i' m in iove .
no , this has nothing to do with me .
i gave you my books ... but i didn' t authorize you to steai my poems .
if you think you gave beatrice the poem i wrote for matilde
poetry doesn' t belong to those who write it , but those who need it .
i appreciate that highly democratic sentiment .
now go home and get some sleep .
you' ve bags under your eyes as iarge and deep as soup bowls .
this is for you .
vote for di cosimo .
they promised us running water ... on the island two years ago , too .
two years ago , it wasn' t di cosimo who promised you .
what' s written on that paper is a pledge , not a promise .
an oath , and god is my witness .
hey , mario !
aren' t you interested in what i' m saying ?
i' m voting communist .
what ?
i' m voting communist .
i hear you' ve gone crazy about poetry .
i hear you' re competing with pablo neruda .
but remember , poets can do a iot of damage to people .
how much do these clams cost ?
300 llre to you .
for that price you' il have to guarantee me a peari in each one .
give me a good price .
i' il give you a discount , all right ?
fishermen are exploited enough as it is .
he said 300 llre .
why should he give you a discount ?
i don' t mean to exploit anyone .
good bye .
why don' t you mind your own business ?
i was trying to help .
mario ... as your superior i must order you to dellver the undellvered mall .
yes , yes , yes .
but you' re still moping after that girl .
beatrice is pretty now ... but in 50 years she' il be as ugly as the rest .
beatrice will never be ugly .
i held the splendor of your eyes ... secretly within me , bilssfui beatrice .
what' s beatrice got to do with it ?
it' s a poem .
dante allghieri
no , gabriele d' annunzio , my poet .
your poet wrote something for beatrice ?
i don' t like it .
strange , i thought you' d appreciate a hymn to beatrice .
thank you .
good bye .
sleeping beauty ...
good evening .
good evening .
give the marshai his usual , and pour one for me , too .
thank you .
your niece gets more and more beautiful .
if you only knew how difficult it is to keep a hold on her .
young people today aren' t what they used to be .
they have everything and want the moon .
i remember my poor departed mother .
i' d tremble whenever she spoke .
good night , aunt .
good night , marshal .
good night , marshal .
find yourselves a decent person who isn' t a communist .
if neruda doesn' t belleve in god , why should god belleve in neruda ?
what sort of witness would he be ?
god never said a communist can' t be a witness at a wedding .
i' m not getting married then .
you' re more interested in neruda as a witness than me as your wife .
my darilng ...
neruda' s a cathollc .
i know he' s a cathollc .
in russia , communists eat babies .
how can he be cathollc ?
he doesn' t iook the type .
neruda has a pretty wife .
he' s getting on and he has no children .
how do you explain that ?
so according to you , don pablo ate his kids ?
who knows ?
anyway , my answer' s no , for your sake , too .
he inspired your bridegroom to write that filthy naked stuff .
that was only a poem .
not to mention the rest .
he' s not worthy of being witness to your happiness .
i ask jesus to iet me llve to see my son with a job ... a wife and children in his arms .
unfortunately , she didn' t make it ... because when the lord called her to him ... he didn' t even have a job .
today , from heaven my poor wife will see that he' s made her happy ... because at ieast he' s got a wife and a llttle job .
even if it' s not the job she' d have wanted for him
all the best !
well done , dad !
what are you doing , drinking wine ?
i' m sorry , comrade , i forgot .
this came for you .
thank you .
good news ?
to the newlyweds !
with a chaste heart ... with pure eyes ...
i celebrate your beauty ... holding the ieash of blood so that it might ieap out ... and trace your outilne ... where you lle down in my ode as in a iand of forests , or in a surf : in aromatic ioam or in sea music .
now ...
i' d like to toast my friend ...
mario ... and say what a pleasure it was for me to participate , in a small way ... to his happiness .
and iastly , i' d like to say that on this very speciai day ...
i have received some wonderfui news .
chile .
no , don pablo .
but you' il be unemployed tomorrow .
no , i don' t want anything .
i' il miss you .
i' il miss you .
but you will write to me ?
of course .
things change all the time in my country .
today they' il iet me go back .
tomorrow something else will happen and i' il have to flee again .
i' il ieave some things here anyway ... if you could keep an eye on it for me .
i' il iet you know where to send them .
perhaps i' il bring them to chile myself .
that' d be wonderful .
do you need this ?
yes .
thank you .
i' ve discovered another poet who wrote about beatrice ... called d' annunzio .
i know .
so you could have written one , too .
good bye .
what is it ?
look at this .
he' s in russia , giving an award .
in russia ?
if he' s over here , he might pay a visit .
he' s a very busy man , mario !
he must meet the people he didn' t see when he was in exile .
and he' s also well loved in chile .
he won' t have time to come here .
it' s a good picture .
the young poet , milovan  perkovic .
awarded a poetry prize by the maestro .
can i keep it ?
no , you can' t .
i' il put it in here with all the rest .
you can iook at it whenever you like .
vote for di cosimo .
the candidate promises to iead us on a new path !
vote for di cosimo !
for a new way of llfe !
for the sake of our island !
did that fellow come here ?
who ?
di cosimo .
yes .
why are you smiling ?
di cosimo has served us a fortune on a silver platter .
really ?
20 families will be coming here to work on the new water mains .
di cosimo asked us if we can provide them with two meals a day .
and we can' t .
we told them we could .
they' il be here for two years .
without asking me ?
just add it all up .
money .
all you can think about is money .
where will we put 20 families ?
we' il do two or three servings if necessary !
please yourselves .
no , we' il do as we please .
would you be prepared to work in the kitchen , " signor " husband ?
in the kitchen ?
yes .
a toast to beatrice , the prettiest giri in town !
look !
what does it say ?
he' s in paris .
whereas i really loved italy ... where i ied a happy llfe in complete solltude ... and among the most simple people in the world .
what things are you most nostalgic about ?
nostalgia is an emotion i can feei only for my own country ... but i will never forget ... my strolls along the beach and among the rocks ... where tiny plants and flowers grow ... exactly the same way as in a iarge garden composition .
go on .
that' s it .
he doesn' t mention us .
why should he mention us in an interview ?
he' s a poet .
poets talk about nature ... not about the people they meet .
the bird that has eaten files away !
i bet he doesn' t even remember what we iook like .
the christian democrats have been victorious in every region .
the party chairman has expressed his satisfaction .
satisfaction !
they haven' t managed it .
what ?
they' ve taken every region in italy .
they can' t do anything with a handfui of votes !
they' ve won a battle , but not the war .
so we' il win the war ?
who else ?
but we have to fight , and we will fight !
it' s the only way to break our chains and set ourselves free !
yes , but here ... when we' ve broken our chains ... what do we do then ?
if don pablo could hear you , he wouldn' t approve .
don pablo .
don pablo can' t hear me .
who knows where he is , what he' s doing ?
what' s with these iong faces ?
mr. di cosimo , this is a tragedy for us .
we were counting on those two years of work .
we' d made plans , run up debts even .
i know , it' s a shame to ieave the work half completed ... but we hope to start again soon .
soon ?
when ?
i don' t know .
it depends .
but i assure you it won' t be iong .
anyway , i can' t wait to try out your cooking .
what does it depend on ?
company problems are very compilcated .
i don' t know much about company problems ... but i' m not daft .
we all knew that as soon as you got elected ... the work would come to a halt .
that' s true .
the husband' s hot blooded .
if don pablo had been here ... maybe the elections would have gone better .
mario , i have something to tell you .
i' m pregnant .
really ?
yes .
you' re really pregnant ?
yes .
we have to ieave here .
no one understands us here .
they' re all too ignorant .
we' il go to chile , so pabilto will grow up there , breathe poetry .
pabilto ?
don' t you like it ?
after neruda .
it' il be a good omen for our son .
mario ?
no .
he' s in front .
mario , is that you ?
there' s a ietter from chile .
put it in my pocket , please .
open it !
wait .
mario ruoppolo .
it' s the first ietter i' ve ever received .

and usefui for what ?
what did i do for this person ?
in fact , it was always me ... who would ask , " don pablo , will you check this metaphor ?
don pablo , will you read me a poem ?
i' m the one who bothered him .
and you say i was useful .
what did i do ?
and yet he knew i was no good as a poet .
he knew , you know ?
but instead he treated me like a friend .
like a brother .
it' s not true that you' re no good .
and i' m not calling him pabilto .
what has the baby got to do with it ?
why , do you think i' m a poet ?
am i a poet ?
have i ever written anything , any poems ?
no , mario , but
then " no , mario " nothing .
admit it .
why should he remember me ?
as a poet , i' m not much good .
as a postman he would hardly remember ... a postman who took him his mall when he llved in italy .
as a communist ?
not even that .
i wasn' t very
i think it' s ... quite normai that he
all right .
tomorrow , we' il go there and send his things off .

number eight .
pabilto' s heartbeat .
you can hear everything !
really ?
you can hear it !
you can hear pabilto' s heart !
i' m not calling him pabilto .
come here , pabilto !
there was a communist demonstration .
pabilto never saw him .
he was born a few days after mario died .
i didn' t want him to go , but he wouldn' t llsten .
don pablo would be proud , " he' d say .
a riot began , and the pollce moved in on the crowd .
he was trapped .
this is something mario made for you .
i should have sent it to you , but i kept it instead .
dearest don pablo ... this is mario .
i hope you haven' t forgotten me .
anyway ... do you remember that you once asked me ... to say something nice about my island ... and i couldn' t think of anything ?
now ...
i know .
so i want to send you this tape ... which , if you want to , you can play to your friends .
if not , you can llsten to it .
then you' il remember me ... and italy .
when you ieft here ...
i thought you' d taken all the beautifui things away with you .
but now ... now i reallze ... that you ieft something behind for me .
i also want to tell you that i' ve written a poem ... but you can' t hear it because i' m embarrassed .
it' s called " song for pablo neruda .
even if it' s about the sea ... it' s dedicated to you .
if you hadn' t come into my llfe ...
i never would have written it .
i' ve been invited to read it in pubilc .
and even though i know my voice will shake , i' il be happy .
and you will hear the people applaud when they hear your name .
comrades !
comrades !
