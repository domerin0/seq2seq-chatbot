each of them lost a leg in the civil war .
my great granddaddy galloway , he lost his left ... and my great granddaddy reid lost his right .

you are shittin ' me .
no , sir .
i swear to god .

what do you suppose the odds of them having the same shoe size was ?
i don' t know , colonel .
it was meant to be , i guess .
yeah .
meant to be .
sir , galloways have been in every war this country' s ever fought .
but when it came to this one , i didn' t think i could stop the war .
i just thought maybe i might try and understand one .

le\ x9ds go !
captain , have your men dig some firing steps .

roger , sergeant major .
kind of makes you wish you' d signed up for submarines , don' t it ?
brigade headquarters wants you out on the first chopper at dawn .
what idiot would keep ordering that in the middle of a goddamn battle ?
gen. westmoreland wants a briefing .
give me the horn .
i am in a fight ... and i object to this order to return to saigon .
now , i will not leave my men .
is that clear ?
out .
there' s two of my men unaccounted for out there ... and i\ x9ds where the worst of the fighting was ... so they' il be out there someplace .

he' il get his massacre .
requesting permission to rejoin the lines , sir .
all right , son .
garry owen , sir .
i wonder what was going through custer' s mind when he realized ... he' d led his men into a slaughter .
sir , custer was a pussy .
you ain' t .
goddamn .
hell .
right now they' re planning their final attack ... the one that will finish us off .
they' il nibble at us all night , then ... come dawn they' il hit us with everything they got .
tha\ x9ds what i' d do if i was him .
sergeant major , hand out the last of the ammunition .
yes , sir .
fix bayonets .
you were wondering how custer felt , sir .
you ought to ask him .
sergeant savage !
checking the dead enemies for documents ... and i found this on the guy that tried to bayonet you .
translated some of it , mostly personal .
thought you might wanna have a look at it .
what was that ?
i\ x9ds american artillery .

how many casualties ?
what the hell happened here , joe ?
hey , joe .
colonel moore !
colonel !
colonel moore !
what is the key to your victory ?
sir , tell us how you feel .
do you feel the states will be forced ... to take the north vietnamese more seriously ?
how do you feel about the loss ofyour men , sir ?
have you notified the families , sir ?
i' m glad you made it , son .
thankyou , sir .
you too .
i' il never forgive myself .
for what , sir ?
that my men ...
that my men died and i didn' t .
sir , i don' t ...
i don' t know how to tell this story .
well , you got to , joe .
you tell the american people what these men did here .
you tell ' em how my troopers died .
yes , sir .
thank you .
all of our men , living and dead , are off the field , sir .
well done , sergeant major .
in saigon , hal moore' s superiors congratulated him ... for killing over 1800 enemy soldiers .
then ordered him to lead the men of the 7th cavalry ... back into the valley of death .
he led them ... and fought beside them ... for 235 more days .
kids , go to bed .
isn' t there someone at the door ?
go to bed !
children , your daddy' s home !
daddy !
some had families waiting .
for others , their only family would be the men they bled beside .
there were no bands , no flags ... no honor guards to welcome them home .
they went to war because their country ordered them to .
but in the end they fought not for their country or their flag .
they fought for each other ...
dear barbara ...
i have no words to express to you my sadness of the loss of jack .
the world is a lesser place without him .
but i know he is with god and the angels .
and even heaven is improved by his presence there .
i know you , too , are sure of this ... and yet this knowledge can' t diminish his loss ... and your grief .
with abiding respect and affection , hal moore .
we who have seen war ... will never stop seeing it .
in the silence of the night , we will always hear the screams .
so this is our story ... for we were soldiers once ... and young .
