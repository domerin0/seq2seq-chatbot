carla .
what the hell do they know ?
they are experts , and she has all the symptoms .
she has an i. q bordering on 2nd grade .
i know about ...
i know a few things about experts .
she has ...
she has significant social adjustment problems .
and now her school ... i' m sorry .
where' s my drink ?
what' s the matter ?
what ?
oh , your drink .
it' s right there .
and now this school , her regular school won' t even take her back .
what about that , radley ?
ah , i need another drink .
forget the drink , radley !
now listen to me .
we need to talk about carla .
do you understand ?
she is beautiful !
we have got to !
have you looked at her ?
she is gorgeous .
she nearly burned the house down with the other two girls in it .
radley , we can' t do this .
that ...
that was an accident .
you know that was an accident .
it was not .
we can' t keep saying things like that .
we can' t keep saying , " carla is a slow learner .
carla will blossom .
because those are lies .
now , radley , we have to do something .
we have to make a decision .
this is a special school in santa barbara .
all right , back up just ...
the school ...
it is for the mentally challenged .
right there .
yes , what ?
now , they don' t allow adults and the parents to go visit them .
they ...
they have limited ... limited visitation , and let me tell you something , radley .
if it doesn' t work out , she doesn' t have to be there .
i don' t ...
i don' t want her to be retarded .
of course you don' t .
of course you don' t .
i understand completely .
we have to send her there , radley .
we don' t have a choice .
all right ?
sign it .
how are you two doing here ?
can i get you anything ?
can i get you anything ?
uh , no , i' ve got water , and , uh ...
ah .
we ordered a vegetarian worm .
no ?
i' il see if i can find one in coach .
i would appreciate that .
i' d like to be the first to welcome you to san francisco international airport .
it' s currently 54 degrees in the bay area ... and a beautiful , clear day .
thank you for choosing to fly with us .
she' s here !
she' s home .
mrs tate !
come on .
all right .
okay .
heather !

she' s home !
that call was important ... and you yelling in the background is not exactly good for business .
i' m sorry .

ladies and gentlemen , the homecoming queen , carla tate .
we' re all waiting for you .
come on , honey .
bring tickles .

oh .

hi , carla !
welcome home .
oh , carla , it' s so good to have you home .
thanks .
say hello to carla .
we missed you , carla .
who' s that ?
uh ...
oh , well , um ...
this is jeff reed .
and , actually , carla , i have kind of a surprise for you because ... we' re engaged to be married .
ooh , yea !
well , let me take your coat , dear .
all right ?
no !
oh .
you sure ?
you don' t want ...
all right , fine .
just ...
dr johnson said that it would be nice ... if i got everybody presents .
oh !
and i thought so too .
well , thank you , carla .
it' s , uh ...
it' s necklaces .
oh !
and they' re beautiful .
carla !
say cheese !
winnie !
welcome home !
i missed you !
it' s so good to see you !
sweetheart !
we were thinking that maybe we would just like to elope , you know ?
that' s very funny , but not hysterical .
all right ?
okay !
we' re gonna have a big wedding ceremony at the church .
and the wedding ...
i know .
we' re gonna have the wedding reception at the club .
you remember the club , don' t you , carla dear ?
yeah !
you know what .
you could just put this in your lap .
that' s good .
that' s very nice that way .
you look very grown up .
so i hear you and jeff settled on a honeymoon spot .
did you two do it yet ?
no .
caroline .
she' s gonna spit it out .
i can see it .
sex is something that we talk about in private , i think .
am i right ?
no , but my teacher at the school says ... that two people do it when they' re in love .
well , i' m sorry , but i' m sure she meant that you do it after , you know , you' re married or something .
definitely .
and then you don' t talk about it ever again in your whole life .
winnie .
a special dessert for carla .
oh , boy .
please .
that' s nice .
so a doctorate , jeff ?
that is so refreshing .
so what is your doctorate dissertation gonna be on ?
um , multi tiered financing of petrol chemical surveys ... in an uncertain political terrain .
finding the big bucks in tiny little countries whose names you can' t pronounce .
wow !
i mean , it' s so good to hear someone' s actually using their college education .
come on .
you know , i' m not teaching second grade because i happen to like children .
you know , i think that they' re the hope of the world .
of course they' re the hope of the world , but , really , isn' t it just as noble ... to be a college professor and earn four times the money ?
mother !
you know what .
daddy , will you make a toast right now ?
i' d gladly make a toast , yeah .
to the tate family and its good ...
i want to go to school also .
that' s great .
well , dear , you just completed school .
and , in fact , i think they gave you a certificate of completion , didn' t they ?
i am gonna be a veterinarian' s assistant .
wow !
and , but to do that , i need a high school diploma .
i think the best thing for right now would be just to have a nice , big , long vacation ... and we' il explore your options later .
okay .
to the ta ...
i would like to explore my options now , mother .
carla , we' re all just a little bit too tired for such an important conversation .
so , radley ...
to the tate family , all of us together again .
follow me .
hurry .
just follow me .
stop it .
stop following me .
i can' t , stupid .
stop it !
i told you , i can' t , stupid .
stop laughing at me !
oh , my goodness !
are you all right ?
carla !
yeah .
all right .
now , i want you to close your eyes .
close your eyes .
okay , carla .
all right .
no , stop , stop .
stop .
yeah .
you can stop .
good girl .
open your eyes .
surprise .
do you ...
what do you think ?
you think ...
do you like it ?
you gave my room to somebody else ?
no !
i redecorated it for you , dear .
i just changed it a little .
but where is my tea party table that was right here ?
who did this ?
well , carla , those are little girl things , and you' re a young woman now .
remember , downstairs you were talking about taking on more responsibility .
well , this is ...
i want my things .
carla , i really think that you should live with these things for a while ... and you' il see , i' m sure that you will grow to like them very much .
and , anyway , dr johnson said that , uh , that these are your favourite colours .
uh , you like red , don' t you ?
where ...
carla , wh ...
why are your eyes closed ?
i' m remembering my old room .
ohh !
heather ?
heather !
bye .
i' m really sorry we didn' t visit you more frequently ... but i got a job in new york , and caroline went to college .
so ...
yeah , but that' s okay ' cause sometimes ... we thought that the visits sometimes upset the parents ... more than it made the kids happy .
well , we' re sorry , carla .
but i liked all your letters that you wrote , heather .
they were better than caroline' s ...
' cause she mostly drew pictures .
what ?
honey , i think you just ...
she' s overwhelmed by all of this .
now , why don' t you just relax ?
you did great , okay ?
just don' t be so hard on yourself .
radley , i' m gonna make it up to that girl .
i really am .
winnie !
your mother said another 15 minutes .
did you tell her that i don' t like tennis still ?
she said that all well bred girls play tennis ... chess or bridge .
oh .
is it 15 minutes yet ?
we' il look at that .
we' il look at that right ...
hello , mrs tate .
how are you ?
oh , victoria , you look so lovely .
thank you .
i' d like you to meet my daughter .
this is carla .
hello , carla .
hello .
didn' t your other daughter , heather , get married ?
no , no .
actually , it' s , uh , caroline is engaged .
oh !
but anyway , i want to see a couple of sweater sets .
and , carla , come on .
that' s a very nice shirt , mom .
very beautiful feet .
nice toes .
and the sock really accentuates your feet .
you know that the , uh , the chinese say ... that the toes are the windows to the soul ?
they do ?
i' ve been to hong kong several times , and i' ve never heard that .
why don' t you just , uh , enlighten us with your knowledge of shoes ?
do you have this in a size eight ?
she' s a little uptight , isn' t she ?
what ?
it' s tight .
this shoe' s a little tight .
it' il ...
here .
how ' bout these ?
these red ones here .
yes , this is a fun shoe , mom .
i don' t think so .
thank you very much .
what about these with the heels ?
remember the leather ?
this is hip .
hip .
those are not what we want .
thank you so much .
mothers are always right .
and today the dogs are here to be seen ... in the hopes that they' il be adopted by the nice people of sutter hills .
and i' m a friend of your mother' s .
and so , thank you from me ...
you know that your mother was the one who made this animal rescue shelter a possibility .
no .
i didn' t ...
yes , and she did a lot of other things in sutter hills .
you' re too kind .
the youth orchestra , the theatre , the library .
wow .
and today your mother' s gonna get some recognition , which she deserves .
my job to introduce the head of our sutter hills city council ...
drew edison .
excuse me .
oh , sure .
of course .
good afternoon , ladies and gentlemen .
there are so many people to thank for this wonderful shelter .
hello , puppy .
and they used every ... carla , please .
fund raising device known to man ...
hello , puppy .
from a , a bake sale in my mother ...
pucky ryan' s ... garden .
carla , please don' t do that .
please .
you' re disrupting . ... country club .
woof !
woof !
woof !
carla .
elizabeth .
elizabeth , your daughter is barking .
carla !
woof !
elizabeth , now they' re all barking .
i know .
carla , dear .
carla .
carla !
oh , i' il quiet them , mom .
they like me .
carla , carla !
hello , puppies .
i' il teach you how to behave , little puppies .
stay !
no , go , go , go .
no !
come back in the cage .
come on .
behave !
mom !
it was so embarrassing , radley .
i feel like ...
i feel like i try all these things , and nothing works .
i' ve been doing my best to have fun with her , but i don' t know what fun for her is .
and she won' t even tell me .
honestly , i just want to quit .
mrs tate !
mrs tate !
carla' s run away !
when the police picked her up , she gave them another name ... and listed this as her home address , so they threw her back here .
here' s the police report .
did she really say that i' m smothering her ?
in so many words .
yeah .
do you want to read the police report ?
i just want you to know that i don' t understand any of this , not for one second .
i give her love , i protect her , i teach her , and suddenly that' s smothering .
those are her words , not mine , mrs tate .
did she tell you that i took her to the pet shelter so she could possibly get a job ?
yes , and we agreed it ended badly .
could you ...
could you not ?
that' s a hand carved indian relic .
i' m sorry .
i also enrolled her in a calligraphy class , an origami class .
and i , i even got her into that ...
she doesn' t want to do those things .
they ...
they don' t interest her .
they don' t work for her .
maybe carla doesn' t know what works for her .
and you do .
i think so .
i' m her mother .
that' s why she tried to hitchhike over 200 miles to get back here ?
would she do that again ?
i believe she will , yes .
if things continue at home the way they' ve been going , yes , absolutely yes .
and we were lucky this time .
she came back here .
a lot of kids run away , we never hear from them again .
this is a girl who is determined to push the edge of the envelope .
and i , for one , i like the fact that she never quits .
specifically , she wants to attend this , uh , uh , bay area polytech .
a public vocational school ?
is that what you' re talking about ?
they do welding there .
she can' t possibly keep up with that .
and she' s going to be humiliated by those people there .
you don' t know they' re going to humiliate her .
of course they' re going to humiliate her !
please ...
they ...
they did it when she was young .
l ...
she' s got to have the opportunity to meet challenges .
i mean , do you want the ... do you want the kid to remain a child the rest of her life ... or do you want to let her grow into an adult and take the same risks that you and i take ?
i want her to take risks .
it' s the kind of ri ...
are you a parent ?
uh , no , not yet , no , no , but i have worked with children ... including yours , for ten years .
y ...
you think she should go to school and be on her own ?
independence can give carla something ... that you and i will never be able to give her .
dignity .
what ?
dignity .
dignity .
to the left .
thanks a lot .
okay , honey , here we are now .
uh , you sure you don' t want me to walk you in ?
no , dad , i' m not ...
i' m fine .
come on , man .
you got to remember to lock your bike up , man .
your mama' s gettin ' tired of buyin ' you bikes .

and she helped me do all my laundry that i brought from school .
yeah .
and i recycled all the garbage , mother .
i know .
well , i mean , someday you' il be able to take care of this house without me .
that' s for sure .
not this house .
maybe one day i' il be able to take care of my own apartment ...
like some of the kids at school do .
oh , carla , you don' t know what you' re saying .
yes , i do .
no , we can' t discuss this right now , all right ?
open these presents .
here .
there .
but ...
thank you , radley .
here you go , dear .
there .
" carla . " it' s from ...
excuse me now .
i have to go feed my fish .
oh .
mother , why did you do that ?
aw , mom .
what did i do ?
i mean , maybe she' s ready for her own apartment .
you know , a lot of the new books out right now ... you know , they ... they advocate disabled people living on their own .
what are we movin ' the presents for ?
why don' t we just take a vote ?
yeah , voting' s nice .
oh , a family meeting .
yes !
a family meeting .
we haven' t had a family meeting in ages .
i would love to try it .
i think we should just forget this , because i just want to say something .
this is not a political referendum .
this is a child' s life .
and this is my child' s life .
carla' s not ready for an apartment .
and really , she may never be ready for an apartment .
my god !
what if there were a fire ?
what if there was a burglar ?
well , that can happen to anyone , honey .
" what if ? " no , but not with carla .
she can' t handle the unexpected , radley .
you know that .
mother , i think that she has tried very hard to show that she' s a responsible person .
heather !
she' s capable .
you don' t live here any more , so you don' t vote !
mom , why don' t you think of it this way , as a ...
oh , look , caroline , you and jeffrey can raise your children any way you want to raise them , but this is my child !
all right .
all right .
ease up .
you know something ?
i don' t know what you' re trying to do .
i don' t know what you' re trying to prove by refuting every single thing i say .
i' m not refuting everything you say !
i didn' t want to put her in that place !
but i had to .
i had no other choice .
she needed professional help .
now it is carla' s turn , and i am going to protect her !
and nobody' s going to tell me how to do it , not even you , radley .
no !
girls , inside , please .
i guess we' il be forever 10 and 12 .
marcia and jan .
don' t you understand what i' m trying to say ?
elizabeth , shut the hell up .
it means a lot to me ...
do not ...
do not speak to me that way in front of the children .
and we are both responsible for putting carla in that place .
you went along with it because you were too drunk to face it .
i made that decision by myself !
i wasn' t drinking when i picked her up , and i haven' t had a drink ... since that family meeting 8 years , 4 months and 11 days ago !
that is not the ...
that is not the same ...
it is the same family .
damn it !
our family , elizabeth !
excuse me .
oh .
dinner will be served soon .
i' il skip dinner .
permission to come aboard ?
permission granted .
i don' t know what' s the matter with me .
i just ...
i ...

i really don' t think so .
i think it' s everybody .

mm mmm .
mm mmm .
is anybody coming to dinner , or are we voting on what' s being served ?
what ?
what is ...
well ...
hot roll or baguette ?
i think i will have a hot roll ...
oh , come on , please .
this is just absurd .
this is not a casual decision , and carla is not like other girls .
but i don' t want to be the one who always says no to her .
i really don' t .
so i' m gonna try and see it your way .
i' m gonna try and see ...
oh !

danny .
well , danny' s kind of cute .
stop teasing , dad !
carla , this way .
uh , your father mentioned that you met a young man .
yeah , that' s daniel .
but i told dad that he was just a " friend " friend , not a boyfriend .
darling , don' t sit there !
it' s just wet .
no , it isn' t , mom .
it' s dry .
it' s dry , mom .
well , carla , you' re going to be getting this apartment ... and i' m sure you' re gonna want to have visitors come over ... and i' m sure that some of these visitors are going to be ... well , they' re going to be young men .
mom , is this a sex talk ?
no .
well , yes .
is that okay ?
okay .
all right .
okay .
well , then i know that recently you mentioned , um ... doing it ... and i just wanted to know if you really know what that means .

and mrs matthews , the health teacher and the cafeteria monitor ... she called it coitus .
and she also told us about penis ...
okay , we' ve got it .
and vulva .
shh .
carla .

and then she was telling us all about semen ...
carla , honey .
and how there' s 50 billion sperms in one shot , and that ...

i understand that .
you know all about reproduction .
that' s excellent .

and that' s excellent advice .
what else did she say to you ?
don' t put gum under the cafeteria table !
how many times do i have to tell you ?
she' s teaching you a lot of variety there .
anyway , dear , with this apartment , i just don' t think that you should have , um ... any boyfriends over for a while , all right ?
is that okay with you ?
but , mom ... what if i want to go visit ... at someone else' s apartment ?
well , in that case , you remember " no , stop .
and you don' t forget your pepper spray .
whose apartment might you be visiting , carla ?

and knowing that ...
i' m sorry .
would you wait one second ?
well , i mean , not don' t like to ...
i' m sorry , but there are no people like carla , okay ?
she happens to be a very unique young woman .
okay .
okay .
of course she is , but they just wanna know ... if the unique young woman is gonna leave the gas on ... or if she' s gonna leave the door unlocked .
this is them asking , not me .
is she reliable ?
well , of course she' s reliable .
i mean , this is her first apartment , though .
i mean , i can' t vouch for the fact that the window might not be left open during a rainstorm ... but what mother can vouch for that ?
look , i understand what their concerns are , but let me tell you something right now , okay ?
my daughter happens to be a very amazing person .
she' s tough , and she is adamant to be on her own .
she' s gonna be just fine .
now , if there' s any sort of a problem , i am only 15 minutes away .
you think that' s gonna be enough for them ?

okay .
bye , carla .
bye , mom .
bye .
bye .

oh , dear .
well ...
i am not the person who is singing
i am the silent one inside
i am not the one who laughs at people' s jokes
we' re not responsible for lost items ... so please make sure you pick up your wings and your antlers .
also , for those interested ... the first quarter grades are posted downstairs on the bulletin board .
who' s next ?
i want to see if i passed .
come on , daniel .
um , well , o okay .
she said it was downstairs .
he who makes the monsters
he who strips my confidence
i passed it .
i passed it , daniel !
i passed my subject in a regular school ... with real tests and regular teachers .
i did it , daniel !
i love polytechnic school !
i love my teachers !
i love everybody , daniel !
but ...
but , daniel ... you didn' t fail by much , just a smidge .
my ...
ohh .
i didn' t ...
i didn' t want to fail by a smidge .
i wanted ...
i i i wanted to ...
i wanted to get out of one class ... just ' cause i passed , not ' cause i was ... n not ' cause i was too old .
it' s o ...
it' s o ...
it' s okay , daniel .
don' t ...
don' t be upset .
no !
no , it isn' t okay !
it isn' t ...
everybody ...
everybody' s right !
everybody' s right , carla !
every ...
i am ...
i' m dumb !
everybody' s right , carla !
everybody ...
carla ...
c carla , can you ...
c could you go away for a second ?
please ?
okay .
okay .
at my special school they taught us ... that first you learn the easy courses .
then after you learn those , you try the harder courses .
only they' re not so hard any more ... because you learned the easy stuff first .
see ?
an another reason i got mad is ' cause i i didn' t want you to think i was dumb .
i could never think that .
it' s amazing how you
can speak right to my heart
without sayin' a word
you can light up the dark
try as i may
i could never explain
what i hear when you don' t say a thing
the smile on your face
lets me know that you need me
there' s a truth in your eyes
sayin' you' il never leave me
the touch of your hand
says you' il catch me
if ever i fall
you say it best
when you say nothin' at all
okay , you' re disappointed .
disappointed in what ?
uh , me ?
you ?
us ?
what ?
well , no , dear , not us .
but , i mean , of course it has been bumpy at times .
but ...
but i always thought we' d end up like this , you know .
somehow sailing along together .
oh , well , good , good .
you' re not disappointed in us .
' cause i love sailing with you .
the girls , they never really liked sailing much .
yeah .
you disappointed with the girls ?
well , i feel like i' m the mother of a dedicated underachiever , a gay workaholic ... and carla , who thinks she can conquer this whole terrifying world that we live in .
honey , they' re doing fine .
they' re not drug addicts ; they' re not axe murderers ; they' re not democrats .
i don' t know .
tell me ...
i don' t know why i am talking like this anyway ... but honestly , radley , sometimes i think that there must be some mothers out there in the world ... who are better equipped to handle carla .
elizabeth , stop it , will ya .
i mean , i know that i fail in some horrible way .
do you know ...
oh , i' il shut up .
i promise .
radley , i' m gonna shut my mouth .
honey , you' re just trying to be honest with yourself .
it' s okay .
it' s not fair , radley .
it' s not fair .
