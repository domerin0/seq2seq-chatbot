now , again , i hope you' re going to ground him .
yes , sally , for a week , but that' s none of your business .
aweek ?
come on .
two days .
i asked you to do one thing today , conrad ... keep the house clean .
do you know how frustrating it is that you' re always doing the exact opposite of what i say ?
<i>knock , knock , knock . </ i>

<i>i found him next door ... </ i> in my yard ... again .
you are a saint .
