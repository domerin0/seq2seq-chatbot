the hovitos are near .
the poison is still fresh , three days .
they' re following us .
if they knew we were here , they would' ve killed us already .
this is it .
this is where forrestal cashed in .
a friend of yours ?
a competitor .
he was good .
he was very , very good .
seor ... nobody' s come out of there alive .
please ...
seor .
stop .
stay out of the light .
forrestal .
let us hurry .
there is nothing to fear here .
that' s what scares me .
stay here .
if you insist , seor .
give me the whip .
throw me the idol .
no time to argue .
throw me the idol , i throw you the whip .
give me the whip !
adios , seor .
adios , satipo .
dr. jones .
again we see there is nothing you can possess which i cannot take away .
and you thought i had given up .
you chose the wrong friends .
this time , it will cost you .
too bad the hovitos ... don' t know you the way i do , belloq .
yes , too bad .
you could warn them , if only you spoke hovitos .
jock !
start the engines !
get it up !
jock , the engines !
start the engines , jock !
there' s a big snake in the plane , jock !
oh , that' s just my pet snake reggie !
i hate snakes , jock !
i hate ' em !
come on !
show a little backbone , will ya ?
neo , " meaning " new " and " lithic " ... l t h ... ... l c , meaning " stone .
turkdean barrow , near hazelton .
contains a central pas passage and three chambers , or cysts ...
... don' t confuse that with robbing , in which case we mean the removal of the contents of the barrow .
this site also demonstrates ... ... one of the great dangers of archaeology ... not to life and limb , although that does sometimes take place ... no , i' m talking about folklore .
in this case , local tradition held that there was golden coffin buried at the site , and this accounts for the holes dug all over the barrow and the generally poor condition of the find .
however , chamber three was undisturbed , and the undisturbed chamber and the grave goods that were found in another , uh ... in the area , give us a r ... uh ... ... reason to da ... to , uh , to to date this , uh , find as we have .
um ... any questions , then ?
no ?
okay , that' s it for the day , then .
um , don' t forget ...
michaelson , chapters four and five for next time .
and i will be in my office on thursday , but not wednesday .
i had it , marcus .
i had it in my hand .
what happened ?
guess .
belloq ?
you want to hear about it ?
not at all .
i' m sure everything you do for the museum conforms to the international treaty for the protection of antiquities .
it' s beautiful , marcus .
i can get it .
i got it all figured out .
marrakech .
i need $2, 000 . look ...
listen to me , old boy .
i brought some people to see you .
look .
i got these pieces .
they' re good pieces , marcus .
look .
indiana ... yes , the museum will buy them , as usual , no questions asked .
yes , they are nice .
they' re worth at least the price of a ticket to marrakech .
but the people i brought are important , and they' re waiting .
what people ?
army intelligence .
they knew you were coming before i did .
seem to know everything .
they wouldn' t tell me what they want .
well , what do i want to see them for ?
what am i , in trouble ?
yes , dr .
jones , we' ve heard a great deal about you .
have you ?
uh , professor of archaeology , expert on the occult , and , uh , how does one say it ?
obtainer of rare antiquities .
that' s one way of saying it .
why don' t you sit down ?
you' il be more comfortable .
oh , thank you .
thank you .
yes , you' re a man of many talents .
now , you studied under professor ravenswood at the university of chicago .
yes , i did .
you have no idea of his present whereabouts ?
uh ... well , just rumors , really .
somewhere in asia , i think .
i haven' t really spoken to him for ten years .
we were friends , but , uh ... had a bit of a falling out , i' m afraid .
mmm .
dr. jones , now , you must understand that this is all strictly confidential , eh ?
i understand .
uh ... yesterday afternoon , our european sections intercepted a ... a german communiqu that was sent from cairo to berlin .
now , to cairo ...
see , over the last two years , the nazis have had teams of archaeologists running around the world
looking for all kinds of religious artifacts .
hitler' s a nut on the subject .
he' s crazy .
he' s obsessed with the occult .
and , right now , apparently , there' s some kind of german archaeological dig going on in the desert outside of cairo .
now , we' ve got some information here , but we can' t make anything out of it , and maybe you can .
tanis development proceeding .
acquire headpiece , staff of ra .
abner ravenwood , u. s.
the nazis have discovered tanis .
just what does that mean to you , uh , tanis ?
well , it ... the city of tanis is one of the possible resting places of the lost ark .
the lost ark ?
yeah , the ark of the covenant .
the chest the hebrews used to carry around the ten commandments .
what do you mean , " commandments " ?
you talking about the ten commandments ?
yes , the actual ten commandments .
the original stone tablets that moses brought down out of mount horeb and smashed , if you believe in that sort of thing .
any of you guys ever go to sunday school ?
well , i ... oh , look .
the hebrews took the broken pieces and put them in the ark .
when they settled in canaan , they put the ark in a place called the temple of solomon .
in jerusalem .
where it stayed for many years .
until , all of a sudden , whoosh , it' s gone .
where ?
well , nobody knows where or when .
however , an egyptian pharaoh ...
shishak .
yes . ... invaded the city of jerusalem right about 980 bc , and he may have taken the ark back to the city of tanis and hidden it in a secret chamber called the well of souls .
secret chamber ?
however , about a year after the pharaoh would return to egypt , the city of tanis was consumed by the desert in a sandstorm which lasted a whole year .
wiped clean by the wrath of god .
uh huh .
obviously , we' ve come to the right men .
now you seem to know , uh , all about this tanis , then .
no , no , not really .
ravenwood is the real expert .
abner did the first serious work on tanis .
collected some of its relics .
it was his obsession , really .
but he never found the city .
frankly , we' re somewhat suspicious of mr. ravenwood .
an american being mentioned so prominently in a secret nazi cable .
oh , rubbish .
ravenswood s no nazi .
well , what do the nazis want him for , then ?
well , obviously , the nazis are looking for the headpiece to the staff of ra and they think abner' s got it .
what exactly is a headpiece to the staff of ra ?
well , the staff is just a stick ...
i don' t know , about this big , nobody really knows for sure how high ... and it' s ... it' s , uh ... it' s capped with an elaborate headpiece ... in the shape of the sun , with a crystal in the center .
and what you did was you take the staff to a special room in tanis ... a map room with a miniature of the city all laid out on the floor ... and if you put the staff in a certain place , at a certain time of day , the sun shone through here and made a beam that came down on the floor here ... and gave you the exact location of the well of the souls .
where the ark of the covenant was kept , right ?
which is exactly what the nazis are looking for .
what does this ark look like ?
uh ... there' s a picture of it right here .
that' s it .
good god .
yes , that' s just what the hebrews thought .
uh ... now , what' s that supposed to be coming out of there ?
lightning ... fire ... power of god or something .
i' m beginning to understand
hitler s interest in this .
oh , yes .
the bible speaks of the ark leveling mountains , and laying waste to entire regions .
an army which carries the ark before it ... is invincible .
you did it , didn' t you ?
they want you to go for it .
oh , marcus !
they want you to get a hold of the ark before the nazis do and they' re prepared to pay handsomely for it .
and the museum ?
the museum gets the ark when we' re finished ?
oh , yes .
oh ... the ark of the covenant .
nothing else has come close .
that thing represents everything we got into archaeology for in the first place .
mmm !
you know , five years ago , i would' ve gone after it myself .
i' m really rather envious .
i' ve got to locate abner .
i think i know where to start .
suppose she' il still be with him ?
possibly , but ...
marion s the least of your worries right now , believe me , indy .
what do you mean ?
well , i mean that for nearly 3, 000 years , man has been searching for the lost ark .
not something to be taken lightly .
no one knows its secrets .
it' s like nothing you' ve ever gone after before .
oh , marcus .
what are you trying to do , scare me ?
you sound like my mother .
we' ve known each other for a long time .
i don' t believe in magic , a lot of superstitious hocus pocus .
i' m going after a find of incredible historical significance .
you' re talking about the bogeyman .
besides , you know what a cautious fellow i am .
nice to see you again , dr .
jones .
thank you .
shh ... shh ...
shh ...
give him space !
give him space !
go on , regan !
shh !
shh !
shh !
shh !
shh !
hello , marion .
indiana jones .
always knew , someday , you' d come walking back through my door .
i never doubted that .
something made it inevitable .
so , what are you doing here in nepal ?
i need one of the pieces your father collected .
i learned to hate you in the last ten years .
i never meant to hurt you .
i was a child .
i was in love .
it was wrong and you knew it !
you knew what you were doing .
now i do !
this is my place .
get out !
i did what i did .
you don' t have to be happy about it , but maybe we could help each other out now .
i need one of the pieces your father collected .
bronze piece , about this size , with a hole in it , off center , with a crystal .
you know the one i mean ?
yeah .
i know it .
where' s abner ?
where' s abner ?
abner' s dead .
marion , i' m sorry .
do you know what you did to me , to my life ?
i can only say i' m sorry so many times .
well , say it again , anyway .
sorry .
yeah , everybody' s sorry .
abner was sorry for dragging me all over this earth
looking for his little bits of junk .
i' m sorry to still be stuck in this dive .
everybody' s sorry for something .
it' s a worthless bronze medallion , marion .
you going to give it to me ?
maybe .
i don' t know where it is .
well , maybe you could find it .
3, 000 bucks .
well , that will get me back , but not in style .
i can get you another two when we get to the states .
it' s important , marion .
trust me .
you know the piece i mean ?
do you know where it is ?
come back tomorrow .
why ?
because i said so , that' s why .
ha !
see you tomorrow , indiana jones .
good evening , fraulein .
the bar' s closed .
we ... we are ... not thirsty .
what do you want ?
the same thing your friend dr .
jones wanted .
surely he told you there would be other interested parties .
must' ve slipped his mind .
the man is ... nefarious .
i hope , for your sake , he has not yet acquired it .
why , are you willing to offer more ?
oh , almost certainly .
do you still have it ?
no .
but i know where it is .
hey , how about a drink for you and your men ?
your fire is dying here .
why don' t you tell me where the piece is right now ?
listen , herr mac ...
i don' t know what kind of people you' re used to dealing with , but nobody tells me what to do in my place .
fraulein ravenwood ,
let me show you what i am used to .
take your hands off me !
take your lousy hands off !
wait a minute .
wait , i ...
i can be reasonable .
that time is passed .
you don' t need that .
wait ...
i' il tell you everything .
yes , i know you will .
let her go .
whiskey .
shoot them .
shoot them both .
my medallion !
well , jones , at least you haven' t forgotten how to show a lady a good time !
boy , you' re something !
yeah , i' il tell you what .
until i get back my $5, 000 , you' re going to get more than you bargained for .
i' m your goddamn partner !
cairo , city of the living .
a paradise on earth .
silence !
why do you forget yourselves ?
what is this ?
where did this animal come from ?
oh ... oh , no .
cute .
what an adorable creature .
then it shall be welcome in our house .
oh , well , no , you don' t have to keep it here just because of me .
i knew the germans would hire you , sallah .
you' re the best digger in egypt .
my services are entirely inconsequential to them .
they' ve hired or shanghaied every digger in cairo .
the excavation is enormous .
they hire only strong backs and they pay pennies for them .
it' s as if the pharaohs had returned .
when did they find the map room ?
three days ago .
they have not one brain among them .
except one .
he is very clever .
he' s a french archaeologist .
what' s his name ?
they call him " bellosh .
belloq .
belloq .
the germans have a great advantage over us .
they are near to discovering the well of souls .
well , they' re not going to find it without this .
who can tell us about these markings ?
perhaps a man i know can help us .
indy ... there is something that troubles me .
what is it ?
the ark .
if it is there , at tanis , then it is something that man was not meant to disturb .
death has always surrounded it .
it is not of this earth .
do we need the monkey , huh ?
i' m surprised at you , jones ... talking that way about our baby .
he' s got your looks , too .
and your brains .
oops !
i noticed that .
she' s a smart little thing ... smart .
hey !
hey , where you going ?
she' il be all right .
have a date .
come on .
come on .
okay ...
marion .
what' s this ?
it' s a date .
you eat ' em .
how come you haven' t found some nice girl to settle down with , raise eight or nine kids , like your friend sallah ?
who says i haven' t ?
i do .
dad had you figured a long time ago .
he said you were a bum .
oh , he' s being generous .
the most gifted bum he ever trained .
you know , he loved you like a son .
took a hell of a lot for you to alienate him .
not much , just you .
marion , get out of here !
duck !
right .
shh !
shh !
marion !
help !
over here , indy !
get out of the way !
move !
move it !
help me !
you can' t do this to me !
i' m an american !
indy !
indiana jones !
help me , jones !
jones !
marion !
indy !
marion ...
dr .
jones .
you looking for me ?
belloq .
good afternoon , dr .
jones .
i ought to kill you right now .
not a very private place for a murder .
well , these arabs don' t care if we kill each other .
they' re not going to interfere in our business .
it was not i who brought the girl into this business .
please , sit down before you fall down .
we can at least behave like civilized people .
i see your taste in friends remains consistent .
how odd that it should end this way for us , after so many stimulating encounters .
i almost regret it .
where shall i find a new adversary so close to my own level ?
try the local sewer .
you and i are very much alike .
archaeology is our religion , yet we have both fallen from the purer faith .
our methods have not differed as much as you pretend .
i am a shadowy reflection of you .
it would take only a nudge to make you like me , to push you out of the light .
now you' re getting nasty .
you know it' s true .
how nice .
look at this .
it' s worthless .
ten dollars from a vendor in the street .
but i take it ,
i bury it in the sand for a thousand years , it becomes priceless ...
like the ark .
men will kill for it .
men like you and me .
what about your boss , der fuehrer ?
i thought he was waiting to take possession .
all in good time .
when i am finished with it .
jones , do you realize what the ark is ?
it' s a transmitter .
it' s a radio for speaking to god .
and it' s within my reach .
you want to talk to god ?
let' s go see him together .
i' ve got nothing better to do .
uncle indy , come back home now !
uncle indy !
next time , indiana jones , it' il take more than children to save you .
uncle indy !
i thought i would find you there .
better than the united states marines , eh ?
marion' s dead .
yes , i know .
and me !
and me !
i' m sorry .
life goes on , indy .
there is the proof .
uh oh .
i have much to tell you .
first we will take them home , and then i will take you to the old man .
i can' t figure out how belloq did it .
where' d he get a copy of the headpiece ?
there are no pictures , no duplicates of it anywhere .
a headpiece like that one , except round the edges , which were rougher .
in the center , the frenchman had embedded a crystal , and ... and surrounding the crystal , on one side , there were raised markings , just like that one .
they made their calculations in the map room ?
this morning .
belloq and the boss german , dietrich .
when they came out of the map room , they gave us a new spot in which to dig , out away from the camp .
the well of the souls , huh ?
come , come , look .
look here ... look .
sit down .
come , sit down .
what is it ?
this is a warning not to disturb the ark of the covenant .
what about the height of the staff , though ?
did belloq get it off of here ?
yes .
it is here .
this were the old way , this mean six kadam high .
about 72 inches .
wait !
and take back one kadam to honor the hebrew god whose ark this is .
you said their headpiece only had markings on one side .
are you absolutely sure ?
belloq' s staff is too long .
they' re digging in the wrong place .
i am the monarch of the sea
i am the ruler of the ...
bad dates .
i told you not to be premature in your communiqu to berlin .
archaeology is not an exact science .
it does not deal in time schedules .
the fuehrer is not a patient man .
he demands constant reports , and he expects progress .
you led me to believe ... nothing !
i made no promises .
i only said it looked very favorable .
besides , with the information in our possession , my calculations were correct .
boy , they' re not kidding , are they ?
what time does the sun hit the map room ?
at about 9 : 00 in the morning .
not much time , then .
where are they digging for the well of the souls ?
on that ridge ... but the map room' s over there .
let' s go , come on .
sallah .
sallah !
they' re here .
please , my friend , what is the matter ?
i fetch the water .
i shall get it for you .
if you want water , i will get you water .
no problem , no problem .
i thought you were dead .
you must have switched baskets .
are you hurt ?
no .
you have to get me out of here , quick .
they' re gonna be back at any minute .
cut me loose .
quick .
they keep asking about you .
what you know .
what' s wrong ?
cut me loose .
i know where the ark is , marion .
the ark' s here ?
i' m coming with you , jones .
get me out of here !
cut me loose !
you can' t leave me here !
if i take you out of here now , they' il start combing the place for us .
jones , you' ve got to get me out of here !
come on , jones , are you crazy ? !
marion , i hate to do this , but if you don' t sit still and keep quiet , this whole thing is going to be shot .
i' il be back to get you .
jones , what' s the matter ?
that' s it .
who knows ?
perhaps the ark is still waiting in some antechamber for us to discover .
perhaps there' s some vital bit of evidence which eludes us .
perhaps ... perhaps the girl can help us .
my feeling exactly .
she was in possession of the original piece for years .
she may know much , if properly motivated .
i tell you , the girl knows nothing .
i' m surprised to find you squeamish .
that is not your reputation .
but it needn' t concern you .
i have the perfect man for this kind of work .
heil hitler .
