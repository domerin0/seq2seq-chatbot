morris .
that' s funny .
this file says frank lee morris .
if you disobey the rules of society , they send you to prison .
if you disobey the rules of prison , they send you to us .
alcatraz is not iike any other prison in the united states .
here , every inmate is confined alone to an individuai ceil .
unlike my predecessors , wardens johnson and blackweil ,
i don' t have good conduct programs .
i do not have inmate councils .
inmates have no say in what they do .
they do as they' re told .
you are not permitted to have newspapers or magazines carrying news .
knowledge of the outside world is what we teii you .
from this day on , your world wiii be everything that happens in this building .
you wiii shave once a day .
you wiii shower twice a week .
you wiii cut your hair once a month .
now , your privileges .
you can talk .
you can work .
other institutions hand out work , but here it' s a privilege that you earn .
i promise you it' s a privilege that you' ii want .
visitors you' re ailowed two a month .
they cannot be former inmates of this or any other federai prison .
aii names that you submit wiii be carefuily checked by the fbl .
what names do you have in mind ?
i can' t think of any offhand .
family members ?
none .
no family .
alcatraz is a maximum security prison with very few privileges .
we don' t make good citizens , but we make good prisoners .
burglary , armed robbery , grand iarceny ...
you' ve escaped from quite a few prisons , haven' t you ?
that' s why you' re here .
alcatraz was built to keep aii the rotten eggs in one basket , and i was speciaily chosen to ensure that the stink from the basket does not escape .
since i' ve been warden some have tried to escape .
most have been recaptured .
those who haven' t have been kiiled or drowned in the bay .
no one has ever escaped from alcatraz .
and no one ever wiil .
you two go everywhere together ?
sure .
even to bed together .
and when i wash , he washes .
that way we sleep nice nice together .
capisce ?
i' m wolf .
where did they transfer you from ?
atlanta .
nice town , atlanta .
i never saw it .
i' m iooking for a ... new punk .
good iuck .
you don' t understand .
i just found her .
why don' t you show her what you can do ?
morris , i need somebody in the iibrary .
take him over there , wiii you ?
yes , captain .
move .
what you want , boy ?
the buii sent me down here to work .
can you read ... boy ?
as iong as it' s in the english ianguage , boy .
you treat them aii iike wolf ?
wolf wanted to get friendly .
i didn' t .
you' ii take that cart to the ceils .
don' t they iet cons down here ?
you see any chairs ?
how come ?
because this is the rock , man .
they don' t want you doing anything here ... but time ... hard friggin ' time .
rock affects dudes differently .
it either brings out your strength , or it breaks you .
what did it do for you ?
what happens when you get out ?
i won' t .
10 years ago ...
i was in this bar in alabama when two dudes started hassling me .
that was their first mistake .
they puiled knives .
that was their second mistake .
they didn' t know how to use them .
that was the iast mistake they ever made .
i got two 99 year sentences back to back .
seems iike you could have pleaded self defence .
the dudes were white , man , just iike you .
when i arrived they put me in one of those dark ceils in d block .
after a while , i went stir crazy .
sliced my achiiles ' tendon to get out .
you' ii see why when you see d block .
teii me something , you through kiiling white guys ?
why ?
weil , i don' t know .
i just figured i wouldn' t turn my back on you .
hey .
what' s your name , man ?
frank .
what' s yours ?
english .
see you iater .
your name ?
morris .
ok .
magazine or book ?
where' s english ?
what did they do , give a nigger a nigger of his own ?
magazine ?
hi .
hi .
i' m bugsy .
magazine ?
thanks .
hey , you' re new .
yeah .
hey , wait , wait a minute .
i haven' t seen a new guy in six months .
it' s nice to talk .
how are the brooklyn dodgers doing ?
moved to la two years ago .
no kidding ?
warden don' t ailow no books in these ceils .
how come ?
because there' s no iight in them .
better deliver them books , morris , where they can be read .
right .
what' s the flower ?
that' s something inside me they can' t iock up with their bars and wails .
i' m doc .
you ever paint ?
no .
why not ?
you scared of dying ?
i don' t think so .
you better be .
you hurt wolf .
wolf' s going to hurt you .
where you going , cracker ?
pete .
something speciai about those steps ?
the higher you sit , the more status you got .
so we play king of the mountain , except here we don' t play for fun , man .
and you' re king ?
yeah .
now , i figure there' s two reasons why you didn' t sit down on my step .
either you' re too scared , or you just hate niggers .
now , which is it , boy ?
you too scared ?
hmm ?
nah .
i just hate niggers .
so no one' s ever busted out .
no one' s ever made it .
everyone has iooked for a way , but there ain' t any .
see those hacks ?
most joints have one hack for every seven cons .
there' s one hack for every three cons here .
you start shitting at night instead of in the morning , they ask why .
let' s say you' re going to try it anyway .
first , you' ve got to get out of the ceil .
each bar has six hard smailer bars set in a steei tube with extra steei poured in .
and there ain' t no way to tunnei out , either .
shit .
this island is solid rock .
see that water ?
it' s over a mile swim to iand .
the currents make it seem iike 10 .
and the water' s so cold it wiii numb your arms in minutes .
even if you are a good swimmer , you won' t have time to make it .
there are 12 counts every day .
sometimes i think that' s aii this shit hole is , one iong count .
we count the hours , the buils count us , and the king buils count the counts .
inside !
everybody in !
i' m assigning you a permanent job ... the carpentry shop .
it' s a paying job .
how much ?
15 cents an hour .
weil , i always knew crime would pay .
it' s a job .
see you iater .
i sleep iousy , but i sniff the glue .
it helps pass the nights .
aren' t you afraid they' ii shake down your ceil ?
then i go to the hole .
it' s worth the chance .
i guess anything you want bad enough is worth the chance .
including busting out ?
hey , maybe there' s a way out .
it' s on top of your head .
yeah .
the ventilator shafts on top of our block .
how do you get on top of the block ?
ask the buii for the key .
thanks .
hey , jive dude , where you going ?
summer' s coming on .
it' s getting cooler .
weather here is as crazy as the rock .
maybe crazier .
mark twain wrote that the coldest winter he ever spent was summer in san francisco .
i can ...
wolf' s coming at you .
is his hand cupped ?
yes .
which one ?
his right .
break off !
drop it , wolf !
drop it , wolf .

i said d block .
when i get out , you' re dead .
you' ii be dead before you get out .

it' s not a suspension .
it' s an elimination .

yes , sir .
painting privileges have been removed .
why ?
i don' t know .
painting' s aii i have .
i' m sorry , doc .

i think there' s something wrong with him .

why not ?
what do you want ?
i got boys life .
i know some queens who fight over it every month .
just give me what you got on top there .
i heard about doc ... and i know why he did it .
somebody took away his painting privileges .
who ?
the warden .
morris .
sir .
i hear there was an accident in the shop .
accident ?
oh , you mean doc .
someone didn' t iike what he was painting , so someone won' t iet him paint .
someone should have warned doc to be carefui what he paints .
i think you' re absolutely right , sir .
there' s always the possibility that some asshole wiii be offended ...
isn' t there ?
we have to be careful .
back in iine .
hey , how' s it going , frank ?
weil , weil .
if it isn' t the anglins .
what are you guys doing , just dropping by ?
thought we' d pay you a visit .
gonna stay iong ?
not iong .
only about 15 or 20 years .
why the rock ?
we were ieaving atlanta when we encountered a minor problem .
such as ?
they saw us .
yeah , that do present a problem .
they shipped us to leavenworth .
but we didn' t iike their accommodations , either .
warden said he knew just the place for us ... alcatraz .
is it true no one' s ever escaped ?
so they teii me .
jesus .
wonder what i' d be iike after 15 years here .
you stiii reading that bible ?
oh , yeah .
it' s opening up aii kinds of new doors .
i turned 35 today .
some birthday .
when' s your birthday ?
i don' t know .
jeez , what kind of childhood did you have ?
short .
i always wanted to see san francisco .
never thought it' d be iike this .
what' d you get sent to the rock for ?
couple of years ago i started stealing cars , for kicks mostly .
i' d seii the parts .
got sent to the state pen .
you end up in alcatraz for that ?
not exactly .
a buii there iiked to push me around .
so when i got out , i went back , and stole his car .
unfortunately , i drove it across the state iine , which made it a federai rap , and i was sent to the rock .
english !
visitor for you .
butts , you got a visitor .
me ?
yeah , you .
probably somebody wants their car back .
heilo , father .
why didn' t you say you were coming ?
i was afraid you wouldn' t iet me .
it' s just hard to see you iike this .
your mama' s going to die .
charley ?
when ?
weil , she' s got a few months .
' can you caii her ? '
we' re not ailowed to make phone cails .
you cannot discuss institution rules .
stick to your personai iife .
this is my personai iife !
you getting a kick out of it ?
heilo ?
heilo !
i love you , charley .
hey , frank .
yeah ?
if you try to get out , i want in .
must be wednesday .
why ?
mystery mounds .
we always have mystery mounds on wednesday .
i can' t taste it .
i just eat it out of habit .
what' s the movie this weekend ?
oh , some cowboy piece of shit .
hey , at ieast they could show us a gangsta movie .
i may have found a way out of here .
you iooking at something ?
the way i figure it , this ceii block' s reaily getting old .
the moist air corrodes the concrete .
the salt is rusting the metal .
i took a naii clipper and dug around the griile at the back of the ceil .
i can dig that griile out , and enlarge the hole into the utility corridor to the top of the ceii block and onto the roof .
how wiii we hide the hole ?
we tear the ads from magazines ... no one wiii miss those ... make cardboard , paint griiles on that , and put it in the hole , maybe partiaily obscure it with a towei or whatever .
i' ve ordered an accordion to put in front of my hole .
