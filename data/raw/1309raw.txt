there was me .
that is , alex , and my three droogs .
that is , pete , georgie and dim .
and we sat in the korova milk bar ... ... trying to make up our rassoodocks ... ... what to do with the evening .
the korova milk bar sold milk plus .
milk plus vellocet or synthemesc or drencrom ... ... which is what we were drinking .
this would sharpen you up ... ... and make you ready for a bit of the old ultra violence .
in dublin ' s fair city
where the girls are so pretty
i first set my eyes
on sweet molly malone
as she wheeled her wheelbarrow
through streets broad and narrow
crying cockles
and mussels ....
one thing i could never stand ... ... was to see a filthy , dirty old drunkie ... ... howling away at the filthy songs of his fathers ... ... and going " blerp blerp " in between ... ... as it might be a filthy , old orchestra in his stinking guts .
i could never stand to see anyone like that , whatever his age .
but more especially when he was real old , like this one was .
can you spare some cutter , me brothers ?
go on !
do me in , you bastard cowards !
i don' t want to live anyway .
not in a stinking world like this .
and what' s so stinking about it ?
it' s a stinking world because there' s no law and order anymore !
it stinks because it lets the young get onto the old . . . . . . like you done !
it' s no world for an old man any longer .
what kind of a world is it at all ?
men on the moon .
men spinning around the earth .
and there' s not no attention paid . . . . . . to earthly law and order no more .
oh dear land
i fought for thee
it was at the derelict casino that we came across billy boy ... ... and his four droogs .
they were about to perform a little of the old ... ... in out , in out on a weepy young devotchka they had there .
well , if it isn' t . . . . . . fat , stinking . . . . . . billy goat billy boy in poison .
how are thou . . . . . . thou globby bottle of cheap , stinking chip oil ?
come and get one in the yarbles . . . . . . if you have any yarbles . . . . . . you eunuch jelly , thou .
let' s get them , boys !
the police !
come on .
let' s go !
the durango 95 purred away real horrorshow .
a nice warm vibratey feeling all through your guttiwuts .
soon it was trees and dark , my brothers ... ... with real country dark .
we fillied around with other travelers of the night ... ... playing hogs of the road .
then we headed west .
what we were after now was the old surprise visit .
that was a real kick ... ... and good for laughs and lashing of the old ultra violent .
who on earth could that be ?
i' il go and see .
yes , who is it ?
excuse me , can you please help ?
there' s been a terrible accident !
my friend' s bleeding to death !
can i please use your telephone ?
we don' t have a telephone .
you' il have to go somewhere else .
but , missus , it' s a matter of life and death !
who is it , dear ?
a young man .
he says there' s been an accident .
he wants to use the telephone .
i suppose you better let him in .
wait a minute , will you ?
i ' m sorry , but we don' t usually let strangers in
what do you want from me ?
right , pete , check the rest of the house .
dim .
i' m singing in the rain
just singing in the rain
what a glorious feeling
i' m happy again
i' m laughing at clouds
so dark up above
the sun' s in my heart
and i' m ready for love
let the stormy clouds chase
everyone from the place
come on with the rain
i' ve a smile on my face
i' il walk down the lane
with a happy refrain
and i' m singing
just singing ... ... in the rain
viddy well , little brother .
viddy well .
we were all feeling a bit shagged and fagged and fashed ... ... it having been an evening of some small energy expenditure .
so we got rid of the auto ... ... and stopped at the korova for a nightcap .
hello , lucy .
had a busy night ?
we' ve been working hard too .
pardon me , luce .
there was some sophistos from the tv studios around the corner ... ... laughing and govoreeting .
the devotchka smeched away ... ... not caring about the wicked world one bit .
then the disk on the stereo twanged off and out .
and in the short silence before the next one came on ... ... she suddenly came with a burst of singing .
and it was , like , for a moment , my brothers ... ... some great bird had flown into the milk bar .
and i felt all the malenky little hairs on my plott ... ... standing endwise .
and the shivers crawling up like slow , malenky lizards ... ... and then down again .
because i knew what she sang .
it was a bit from the glorious 9th , by ludwig van .
what did you do that for ?
for being a bastard with no manners .
without a dook of an idea about how to comport yourself public wise .
i don' t like you should do what you done .
and i ' m not your brother no more and wouldn' t want to be .
watch that .
do watch that . . . . . . if to continue to be on live thou dost wish .
yarbles !
great , bouncy yarblockos to you !
i' il meet you with chain or nozh or britva anytime .
i ' m not having you aiming tolchocks at me reasonless .
it stands to reason , i won' t have it .
a nozh scrap anytime you say .
doobidoob .
a bit tired maybe .
best not to say more .
bedways is rightways now .
so best we go homeways and get a bit of spatchka .
right , right ?
where i lived was with my dada and mum ... ... in municipal flat block 18 a linear north .
it had been a wonderful evening .
and what i needed now to give it the perfect ending ... ... was a bit of the old ludwig van .
oh , bliss !
bliss and heaven !
it was gorgeousness and gorgeosity made flesh .
it was like a bird of rarest spun , heaven metal .
or like silvery wine flowing in a spaceship ... ... gravity all nonsense now .
as i slooshied ... ... l knew such lovely pictures .
alex .
alex !
what do you want ?
it' s past 8 : 00 , alex .
you don' t want to be late for school , son .
bit of a pain in the gulliver , mum .
leave us be , and i' il try and sleep it off .
and then i' il be as right as dodgers for this after .
but you' ve not been to school all week , son .
got to rest , mum .
got to get fit .
otherwise i ' m liable to miss a lot more school .
i' il put your breakfast in the oven .
i' ve got to be off meself now .
all right , mum .
have a nice day at the factory .
he' s not feeling too good again this morning , dad .
yes .
yes , i heard .
you know what time he got in ?
no , i don' t .
i' d taken me sleepers .
i wonder . . . . . . where exactly is it he goes to work of evenings .
like he says . . . . . . it' s mostly odd things he does .
helping like . . . . . . here and there as it might be .
hi , hi , hi , mr. deltoid .
funny surprise , seeing you here .
alex boy .
awake at last , yes ?
i met your mother on the way to work , yes ?
she gave me the key .
she said something about a pain somewhere .
hence not at school , yes ?
a rather intolerable pain in the head , brother sir .
it should be clear by this afterlunch .
or certainly by this evening , yes .
the evening' s the great time , isn' t it , alex boy ?
cup of the old chai , sir ?
no time , no time , yes .
sit , sit , sit !
to what do i owe this extreme pleasure , sir ?
anything wrong , sir ?
wrong ?
why should you think of anything being wrong ?
have you been doing something you shouldn' t ?
just a manner of speech .
yes , well , it' s just a manner of speech from your . . . . . . post corrective advisor to you , that you watch out , little alex .
because next time it' s not going to be the corrective school .
next time it' il be the barley place , and all my work ruined .
if you' ve no respect for yourself . . . . . . you at least might have some for me , who sweated over you .
a big , black mark , i tell you , for every one we don' t reclaim .
a confession of failure for every one of you . . . . . . who ends up in the stripy hole .
i' ve been doing nothing i shouldn' t .
the millicents have nothing on me , brother .
sir , i mean .
cut out this clever talk about millicents .
just because the police haven' t picked you up . . . . . . doesn' t mean that you' ve not been up to some nastiness .
there was a bit of nastiness last night .
some very extreme nastiness , yes ?
a few of a certain billy boy' s friends were ambulanced off late .
your name was mentioned .
the words got to me by the usual channels .
certain friends of yours were named also .
nobody can prove anything about anybody , as usual .
i ' m warning you , little alex . . . . . . being a good friend to you as always . . . . . . the one man in this sore and sick community . . . . . . who wants to save you from yourself !
what gets into you all ?
we' ve been studying the problem for damn well near a century .
but we get no farther with our studies .
you got a good home here .
good , loving parents .
you' ve got not too bad of a brain .
is it some devil that crawls inside of you ?
nobody' s got anything on me .
i been out of the millicents ' rookers for a long time .
that' s just what worries me .
a bit too long to be safe .
you ' re about due , by my reckoning .
that' s why i ' m warning you . . . . . . to keep your handsome young proboscis out of the dirt .
do i make myself clear ?
as an unmuddied lake , sir .
as clear as an azure sky of deepest summer .
you can rely on me , sir .
excuse me , brother .
i ordered this two weeks ago .
can you see if it' s arrived ?
just a minute .
pardon me , ladies .
enjoying that , are you , my darling ?
a bit cold and pointless , isn' t it , my lovely ?
what' s happened to yours , my little sister ?
who you getting , bratty ?
goggly gogol ?
johnny zhivago ?
the heaven 1 7 ?
what you got back home to play your fuzzy warbles on ?
i bet you' ve got little say , pitiful , portable picnic players .
come with uncle and hear all proper .
hear angel trumpets and devil trombones .
you are invited .
hi , hi , hi , there .
well , hello .
he are here !
he have arrived !
hooray !
welly , welly , welly , welly , welly , welly , well .
to what do i owe the extreme pleasure . . . . . . of this surprising visit ?
we got worried .
there we were , waiting and drinking away at the old knifey moloko . . . . . . and you had not turned up .
and we thought you might have been , like . . . . . . offended by something or other .
so around we come to your abode .
appy polly loggies .
i had something of a pain in the gulliver , so i had to sleep .
i was not awakened when i gave orders for wakening .
sorry about the pain .
using the gulliver too much like , maybe .
giving orders and discipline and such , perhaps .
you sure the pain is gone ?
you sure you' d not be happier back in bed ?
let' s get things nice and sparkling clear .
this sarcasm , if i may call it such . . . . . . does not become you , my little brothers .
as i am your droog and leader . . . . . . i ' m entitled to know what goes on .
now then , dim .
what does that great big horsey gape of a grin portend ?
all right , no more picking on dim , brother .
that' s part of the new way .
new way ?
what' s this about a new way ?
there' s been some very large talk behind my sleeping back , i know it .
if you must have it , have it , then .
we go around shop crasting and the like . . . . . . coming out with a pitiful rookerfull of money each .
and will the english in the coffee mesto . . . . . . saying he can fence anything any malchick tries to crast .
the shiny stuff .
the lce !
the big , big , big money' s available , is what will the english says .
and what will you do with the big , big , big money ?
have you not everything you need ?
if you need a motorcar , you pluck it from the trees .
if you need pretty polly , you take it .
brother , you think and talk sometimes like a little child .
tonight we pull a man size crast .
good !
real horrorshow !
initiative comes to thems that wait .
i' ve taught you much , my little droogies .
now tell me what you had in mind , georgie boy .
the old moloko plus first .
would you not say ?
something to sharpen us up .
you especially .
we have the start .
as we walked along the flatblock marina ... ... l was calm on the outside , but thinking all the time .
so now it was to be georgie the general ... ... saying what we should do and what not to do .
and dim as his mindless , grinning bulldog .
but suddenly i viddied that thinking was for the gloopy ones ... ... and that the oomny ones used , like ... ... inspiration and what bog sends .
for now it was lovely music that came to my aid .
there was a window open with a stereo on ... ... and i viddied right at once what to do .
i had not cut into any of dim ' s main cables .
and so with the help of a clean tashtook ... ... the red , red kroovy soon stopped .
and it did not take long to quieten the two wounded soldiers ... ... down in the snug of the duke of new york .
now they knew who was master and leader .
sheep , thought l .
but a real leader knows always when , like ... ... to give and show generous to his unders .
now we ' re back to where we were .
yes ?
just like before , and all forgotten ?
right , right , right ?
right .
right .
right .
well , georgie boy . . . . . . this idea of yours for tonight .
tell us all about it , then .
not tonight .
not this nochy .
come , come , come , georgie boy .
you ' re a big , strong chelloveck , like us all .
we ' re not little children , are we , georgie boy ?
what , then , didst thou in thy mind have ?
it' s this health farm .
a bit out of the town .
isolated .
it' s owned by this rich ptitsa ... ... who lives there with her cats .
the place is shut down for a week ... ... and she' s completely on her own .
it' s full up with , like , gold and silver ... ... and , like , jewels .
tell me more , georgie boy .
tell me more .
oh , shit !
who' s there ?
excuse me , can you please help ?
there' s been a terrible accident !
can i please use your telephone for an ambulance ?
i ' m frightfully sorry .
there' s a telephone in the public house a mile down the road .
i suggest you use that .
but missus , this is an emergency !
it' s a matter of life and death !
me friend' s lying in the middle of the road , bleeding to death !
i ' m very sorry . . . . . . but i never open the door to strangers after dark .
very well , madam .
you can' t be blamed for being suspicious . . . . . . with so many scoundrels and rogues of the night about .
i' il try and get help at the pub , then .
i ' m sorry if i disturbed you .
thank you very much .
good night .
dim , bend down .
i' il get in that window and open the front door .
hello .
radlett police station ?
good evening .
it' s miss weathers at woodmere health farm .
i ' m sorry to bother you , but something rather odd just happened .
it' s probably nothing at all , but you never know .
a young man rang the bell , asking to use the telephone .
he said there' s been some kind of accident .
the thing that caught my attention was what he said .
his words sounded like those quoted in the papers this morning . . . . . . in connection with the writer and his wife who were assaulted .
just a few minutes ago .
if you think that' s necessary .
but i ' m quite sure he' s gone away now .
all right , fine .
thank you very much .
hi , hi , hi there .
at last we meet .
our brief govorett through the letter hole was not satisfactory .
who are you ?
how the hell did you get in here ?
what the bloody hell do you think you ' re doing ?
naughty , naughty , naughty !
you filthy old soomaka .
now listen here , you little bastard !
just turn round and walk out of here the same way you came in .
leave that alone !
don' t touch it !
it' s a very important work of art .
what the bloody hell do you want ?
to be perfectly honest , madam . . . . . . i ' m taking part in an international students ' contest . . . . . . to see who can get the most points for selling magazines .
cut the shit , sonny . . . . . . and get out of here before you get yourself into serious trouble .
i told you to leave that alone !
now get out of here . . . . . . before i throw you out !
wretched , slummy bedbug !
i' il teach you to break into real people' s houses .
fucking . . . . . . little . . . . . . bastard !
let' s go !
the police are coming !
one minoota , droogie .
you bastards !
i ' m blind !
i ' m blind , you bastards !
i can' t see !
it' s no good sitting there in hope , my little brothers .
i won' t say a single solitary slovo unless i have my lawyer here .
i know the law , you bastards .
righty right , tom .
we' il have to show our friend alex here that we know the law too .
but that knowing the law isn' t everything .
nasty cut you' ve got there , little alex .
shame , isn' t it ?
spoils all your beauty .
who gave you that , then ?
how' d you do that , then ?
what' s your point , you bastard ?
that is for your lady victim .
you ghastly . . . . . . wretched scoundrel .
get him off me !
you rotten little bastard !
good evening , mr. deltoid .
good evening , sergeant .
they ' re in room b , sir .
thank you very much .
sergeant
good evening .
good evening , inspector .
would you like your tea now , sir ?
no , thank you , sergeant .
may i have some paper towels , please ?
we ' re interrogating the prisoner now .
perhaps you' d care to come inside .
thank you very much .
good evening , sergeant .
good evening , all .
oh , dear !
this boy does look a mess , doesn' t he ?
just look at the state of him .
loves young nightmare like .
violence makes violence .
he resisted his lawful arrestors .
this is the end of the line for me .
the end of the line , yes .
and what of me , brother sir ?
speak up for me .
i ' m not so bad .
i was led on by the treachery of others .
sings the roof off lovely , he does , sir .
where are my treacherous droogs ?
get them before they get away !
it was all their idea , brothers .
they forced me to do it .
i ' m innocent !
you are now a murderer , little alex .
a murderer .
not true , sir .
it was only a slight tolchok .
she were breathing , i swear it .
i' ve just come from the hospital .
your victim has died .
you try to frighten me .
admit so , sir .
this is some new form of torture .
say it , brother sir .
it will be your own torture .
i hope to god it' il torture you to madness .
if you' d care to give him a bash in the chops , don' t mind us .
we' il hold him down .
he must be a great disappointment to you , sir .
this is the real weepy and tragic part of the story beginning ... ... o , my brothers and only friends .
after a trial with judges and a jury ... ... and hard words spoken against your friend and humble narrator ... ... he was sentenced to 14 years in staja number 84 f ... ... among smelly perverts and hardened prestoopniks .
the shock sending my dada beating his bruised and krovvy rookers ... ... against unfair bog in his heaven .
and my mum boo hoo hooing in her mother' s grief . .. ... at her only child and son of her bosom ... ... like , letting everybody down real horrorshow .

what' s it going to be , eh ?
is it going to be in and out of institutions like this . . . . . . though more in than out for most of you ?
or are you going to attend to the divine word . . . . . . and realize the punishments that await unrepentant sinners . . . . . . in the next world as well as this ?
a lot of idiots you are . . . . . . selling your birthright for a saucer of cold porridge .
the thrill of theft .
of violence .
the urge to live easy .
well , i ask you what is it worth . . . . . . when we have undeniable proof . . . . . . yes , incontrovertible evidence . . . . . . that hell exists ?
i know !
i know , my friends .
i have been informed . . . . . . in visions . . . . . . that there is a place . . . . . . darker than any prison . . . . . . hotter than any flame of human fire . . . . . . where souls . . . . . . of unrepentant criminal sinners like yourselves
don' t you laugh , damn you !
don' t you laugh .
i say , like yourselves . . . . . . scream . . . . . . in endless and unendurable agony .
their skin . . . . . . rotting and peeling .
a fireball . . . . . . spinning in their screaming guts !
i know .
yes , i know !
all right , you lot !
we' il end by singing hymn 258 . . . . . . in the prisoner' s hymnal .
and let' s have a little reverence , you bastards !
i was a wandering sheep
sing up , damn you !
i did not love the fold
louder !
i did not love my shepherd' s voice
i would not be controlled
never !
it had not been edifying .
indeed not .
being in this hellhole and human zoo for two years now .
being kicked and tolchoked by brutal warders ... ... and meeting leering criminals and perverts ... ... ready to dribble all over ... ... a luscious young malchick like your storyteller .
it was my rabbit ... ... to help the prison charlie with the sunda y service .
he was a bolshy , great burly bastard .
but he was very fond of myself , me being very young ... ... and also now very interested in the big book .
i read all about the scourging and the crowning with thorns .
and i could viddy myself helping in ... ... and even taking charge of the tolchoking and the nailing in .
being dressed in the height of roman fashion .
i didn' t so much like the latter part of the book ... ... which is more like all preachy talking ... ... than fighting and the old in out .
i like the parts where these old yahoodies tolchok each other ... ... and then drink their hebrew vino ... ... and getting onto the bed with their wives ' handmaidens .
that kept me going .
seek not to be like evil men .
neither desire to be with them . . . . . . because their minds studieth robberies . . . . . . and their lips speak deceits .
if thou lose hope , being weary in the days of distress . . . . . . thy strength shall be diminished .
fine , my son .
fine .
father ?
i have tried , have i not ?
you have , my son .
i' ve done my best , have i not ?
indeed .
i' ve never been guilty of any institutional infraction , have l ?
you certainly have not , 65532 1 .
you' ve been very helpful .
and you' ve shown a genuine desire to reform .
father . . .
. . . can i ask you a question in private ?
certainly , my son .
certainly .
is there something troubling you , my son ?
don' t be shy to speak up .
remember . . . . . . i know . . . . . . of the urges that can trouble young men . . . . . . deprived . . . . . . of the society of women .
it' s nothing like that , father .
it' s about this new thing they ' re all talking about .
about this new treatment .
it gets you out of prison in no time .
and makes sure you never get back in again .
where did you hear about this ?
who' s been talking about these things ?
these things get around .
two warders talk , as it might be .
and somebody can' t help overhearing what they say .
then somebody picks up a scrap of newspaper in the workshops . . . . . . and the newspaper tells all about it .
how about putting me in for this new treatment ?
i take it . . . . . . you are referring . . . . . . to the ludovico technique .
i don' t know what it' s called .
i just know it gets you out quickly . . . . . . and makes sure you never get back in again .
that is not proven , 65532 1 .
in fact , it is only in the experimental stage at this moment .
it has been used , hasn' t it ?
it has not been used in this prison yet .
the governor has grave doubts about it .
and i' ve heard there are very serious dangers involved .
i don' t care about the dangers .
i just want to be good .
i want for the rest of my life to be . . . . . . one act of goodness .
the question is . . . . . . whether or not this technique . . . . . . really makes a man good .
goodness comes from within .
goodness . . . . . . is chosen .
when a man cannot choose . . . . . . he ceases to be a man .
i don' t understand . . . . . . about the whys and wherefores .
i only know i want to be good .
be patient , my son .
put your trust in the lord .
instruct thy son and he shall refresh thee . . . . . . and shall give delight to thy soul .
amen .
mister !
all present and correct , sir !
right !
all present and correct , sir !
prisoners , halt !
now pay attention !
i want you in two lines . . . . . . up against that wall , facing this way .
go on , move !
hurry up !
stop talking !
prisoners ready for inspection , sir !
how many to a cell ?
four in this block , sir .
cram criminals together and what do you get ?
concentrated criminality .
crime in the midst of punishment .
i agree , sir .
we need larger prisons , more money .
not a chance , my dear fellow .
the government can' t be concerned any longer . . . . . . with outmoded penalogical theories .
soon we may need all prison space for political offenders .
common criminals are best dealt with on a purely curative basis .
i kill the criminal reflex , that' s all .
full implementation in a year' s time .
punishment means nothing to them .
they enjoy their so called punishment .
you ' re absolutely right , sir .
shut your bleeding hole !
who said that ?
i did , sir .
what crime did you commit ?
the accidental killing of a person , sir .
he brutally murdered a woman in furtherance of theft .
fourteen years , sir .
excellent .
he' s enterprising . . . . . . aggressive . . . . . . outgoing . . . . . . young . . . . . . bold . . . . . . vicious .
he' il do .
fine .
we could still look at c block .
no , no .
that' s enough .
he' s perfect .
i want his records sent to me .
this vicious young hoodlum . . . . . . will be transformed out of all recognition .
thank you very much for this chance .
let' s hope you make the most of it , my boy .
shall we go to my office ?
thank you .
come in .
sir !
65532 1 .
sir !
very good , chief .
over to the line .
toes behind it .
full name and number to the governor .
alexander delarge , sir .
65532 1 , sir .
i don' t suppose you know who that was this morning .
that was no less a personage than the minister of the interior .
the new minister of the interior .
what they call a very new broom .
these new ridiculous ideas have come at last .
and orders are orders .
though i may say to you in confidence , i do not approve .
an eye for an eye , i say .
if someone hits you , you hit back , do you not ?
why should not the state , severely hit by you hooligans . . . . . . not hit back also ?
the new view is to say " no .
the new view is that we turn the bad into good .
all of which seems to me to be grossly unjust .
shut your filthy hole , you scum !
you are to be reformed .
tomorrow you will go to this man , brodsky .
you will be leaving here .
you will be transferred to the ludovico medical facility .
it' s believed you' il be able . . . . . . to leave state custody in a fortnight .
i suppose that prospect pleases you ?
answer the governor' s question !
yes , sir .
thank you very much .
i' ve done my best here , i really have , sir .
i ' m very grateful to all concerned , sir .
sign this where it' s marked .
don' t read it , sign it !
it says you ' re willing to have your sentence commuted . . . . . . to submission to the ludovico treatment .
and this .
and another copy .
the next morning i was taken to ... ... the ludovico medical facility ... ... outside the town center .
i felt a malenky bit sad ... ... having to say goodbye to the old staja ... ... as you will when you leave a place you' ve gotten used to .
right , hold the prisoner .
good morning , sir .
i ' m chief officer barnes .
i' ve got 65532 1 . . . . . . on a transfer from parkmoor to the ludovico centre , sir .
good morning .
yes , we' ve been expecting you .
i ' m dr. alcot .
dr. alcot .
very good , sir .
are you prepared for the prisoner ?
yes , of course .
i wonder if you' d mind signing these documents , sir .
there , sir .
and there , sir .
and there .
there you are .
prison escort , move forward !
halt !
excuse me , sir .
is that the officer that is to take charge of the prisoner ?
a word of advice , doc .
you' il have to watch this one .
a right brutal bastard he has been , and will be again . . . . . . in spite of all his sucking up and reading the bible .
we can manage things .
show the young man to his room .
right , sir .
come this way , please .
morning , charlie .
good morning , doctor .
good morning , alex .
my name is dr. branom .
i ' m dr. brodsky' s assistant .
good morning , missus .
lovely day .
indeed , it is .
may i take that ?
how are you feeling ?
fine , fine .
good .
in a few minutes you' il meet dr. brodsky . . . . . . and begin your treatment .
you ' re a very lucky boy to have been chosen .
i realize that , and i ' m very grateful .
we ' re going to be friends , aren' t we ?
i hope so , missus .
what' s the hypo for ?
sending me to sleep ?
nothing of the sort .
vitamins , will it be , then ?
something like that .
you ' re undernourished .
so after each meal we' il give you a shot .
roll over on your right side .
loosen your pajama pants and pull them halfway down .
what exactly is the treatment here going to be , then ?
it' s quite simple , really .
we ' re going to show you some films .
you mean , like going to the pictures ?
something like that .
that' s good .
i like to viddy the old films now and again .
and viddy films i would .
where i was taken to , brothers ... ... was like no cine i ever viddied before .
i was bound up in a straitjacket ... ... and my gulliver was strapped to a headrest ... ... with wires running away from it .
then they clamped , like , lid locks on me eyes ... ... so that i could not shut them , no matter how hard i tried .
it seemed a bit crazy to me ... ... but i let them get on with what they wanted to get on with .
if i was to be a free malchick again in a fortnight ... ... l would put up with much in the meantime , my brothers .
the first film was a very good , professional piece of cine ... ... like it was done in hollywood .
the sounds were real horrorshow .
you could slooshy the screams and moans very realistic .
you could even get the breathing and panting ... ... of the tolchocking malchicks at the same time .
and then what do you know ?
soon our dear old friend ... ... the red , red vino on tap ... ... the same in all places ... ... like it' s put out by the same firm ... ... began to flow .
it was beautiful .
it' s funny how the colors of the real world ... ... only seem really real ... ... when you viddy them on a screen .
now , all the time i was watching this ... ... l was beginning to get very aware ... ... of , like , not feeling all that well .
and this i put down to all the rich food and vitamins .
but i tried to forget this , concentrating on the next film ... ... which jumped right away on a young devotchka ... ... who was being given the old in out , in out ... ... first by one malchick ... ... then another .
then another .
when it came to the 6th or 7th malchick ... ... leering and smecking and then going into it ... ... l began to feel really sick .
but i could not shut me glazzies .
and even if i tried to move my glazzballs about ... ... l still could not get out of . .. ... the line of fire of this picture .
get me up .
i ' m going to be sick .
get something for me to be sick in !
very soon now , the drug will cause the subject . . . . . . to experience a deathlike paralysis . . . . . . together with deep feelings of terror and helplessness .
one of our early test subjects . . . . . . . described it as being like death .
a sense of stifling or drowning .
and it is during this period , we have found . . . . . . the subject will make his most rewarding associations . . . . . . between his catastrophic experience , environment . . . . . . and the violence he sees .
dr. brodsky is pleased with you .
you' ve made a very positive response .
tomorrow there will be two sessions , morning and afternoon .
you mean i have to viddy two sessions in one day ?
i imagine you' il feel a bit limp by the end of the day .
but we have to be hard on you .
you have to be cured .
it was horrible .
of course it was horrible .
violence is a very horrible thing .
that' s what you ' re learning now .
your body' s learning it .
i just don' t understand about feeling sick the way i did .
i never used to feel sick .
i used to feel the very opposite .
doing it or watching it , i used to feel real horrorshow .
you felt ill this afternoon because you ' re getting better .
when we ' re healthy , we respond to the hateful . . . . . . with fear and nausea .
you ' re becoming healthy , that' s all .
by this time tomorrow , you' il be healthier still .
it was the next day , brothers ... ... and i had truly done my best ... ... morning and afternoon to play it their way ... ... and sit like a horrorshow cooperative malchick ... ... in the chair of torture ... ... while they flashed nasty bits of ultra violence on the screen ... ... though not on the soundtrack , the only sound being music .
then i noticed , in all my pain and sickness ... ... what music it was that , like , cracked and boomed .
it was ludwig van .
ninth symphony .
fourth movement .
stop it !
stop it !
please , i beg you !
it' s a sin !
it' s a sin !
it' s a sin !
it' s a sin !
it' s a sin !
it' s a sin !
sin ?
what' s all this about sin ?
that !
using ludwig van like that .
he did no harm to anyone .
beethoven just wrote music .
are you referring to the background score ?
you' ve heard beethoven before ?
so you ' re keen on music ?
can' t be helped .
here' s the punishment element perhaps .
the governor ought to be pleased .
i ' m sorry , alex .
this is for your own good .
you' il have to bear with us for a while .
but it' s not fair .
it' s not fair i should feel ill when i hear . . . . . . lovely , lovely , ludwig van .
you must take your chance , boy .
the choice has been all yours .
you needn' t take it any further , sir .
you' ve proved to me all this ultra violence and killing . . . . . . is wrong , wrong and terribly wrong !
i' ve learned me lesson , sir .
i see now what i' ve never seen before .
i ' m cured .
praise god !
you ' re not cured yet , boy .
but , sirs .
missus !
i see that it' s wrong !
it' s wrong because it' s , like , against society .
because everybody has the right to live and be happy . . . . . . without being tolchocked and knifed !
no , no , boy .
you really must leave it to us .
but be cheerful about it .
in less than a fortnight now , you' il be a free man .
ladies and gentlemen . . . . . . at this stage we introduce the subject himself .
he is , as you will perceive , fit and well nourished .
he comes straight from a night' s sleep and a good breakfast . . . . . . undrugged . . . . . . unhypnotized .
tomorrow we send him out with confidence into the world again . . . . . . as decent a lad as you would meet on a may morning .
what a change is here , ladies and gentlemen .
from the hoodlum the state committed . . . . . . to unprofitable punishment some two years ago .
unchanged after two years .
unchanged , do i say ?
not quite .
prison taught him the false smile , the rubbed hands of hypocrisy .
the fawning , greased , obsequious leer .
other vices it taught him . . . . . . as well as confirming him in those he had long practiced before .
our party promised to restore law and order . . . . . . and to make the streets safe for the ordinary peace loving citizen .
this pledge is now about to become a reality .
ladies and gentlemen , today is an historic moment .
the problem of criminal violence is soon to be a thing of the past .
but enough of words .
actions speak louder than .
action now .
observe all .
our necks are out a long way on this , minister .
i have complete faith in brodsky .
if the polls are right , we have nothing to lose .
hello , heap of dirt .
you don' t wash much , do you ?
judging by the horrible smell .
why do you say that ?
i had a shower this morning .
he had a shower this morning .
you trying to call me a liar ?
no , brother .
you must think i ' m awfully stupid .
why did you do that , brother ?
i' ve never done wrong to you .
you want to know why i did that ?
well , you see . . . . . . i do this . . . . . . and that . . . . . . and this because i don' t like your horrible type , do l ?
and if you want to start something . . . . . . you just go ahead .
go on !
please do !
i ' m going to be sick .
you ' re going to be sick , are you ?
i ' m going to be sick .
please let me get up .
you want to get up ?
well , now you listen to me .
if you want to get up . . . . . . you' ve got to do something for me .
here .
here .
you see that ?
you see that shoe ?
i want you to lick it .
go on !
lick it .
and , o my brothers , would you believe ... ... your faithful friend and long suffering narrator ... ... pushed out his red yabzick a mile and a half . .. ... to lick the grahzny , vonny boots .
and again !
the horrible killing sickness had whooshed up ... ... and turned the joy of battle ... ... into a feeling i was going to snuff it .
and again .
nice and clean .
thank you very much .
that will do very well .
thank you very much , ladies and gentlemen .
she came towards me ... ... with the light like it was the light light of heavenly grace .
and the thing that flashed in me gulliver ... ... was that i' d like to have her there on the floor ... ... with the old in out .
real savage .
but quick as a shot came the sickness .
like a detective who' d been watching around the corner ... ... and now followed to make his arrest .
enough .
thank you very much .
thank you , my dear .
not feeling too bad now , are you ?
no , sir .
i feel really great , sir .
good .
was it all right , sir ?
did i do well ?
fine , my boy .
absolutely fine .
you see , ladies and gentlemen . . . . . . our subject is impelled towards the good . . . . . . by paradoxically being impelled towards evil .
the intention to act violently . . . . . . is accompanied by strong feelings of physical distress .
to counter these , the subject has to switch . . . . . . to a diametrically opposed attitude .
any questions ?
choice .
the boy has no real choice , has he ?
self interest .
the fear of physical pain . . . . . . drove him to that grotesque act of self abasement .
its insincerity was clearly to be seen .
he ceases to be a wrongdoer .
he ceases also to be a creature capable of moral choice .
padre , these are subtleties .
we ' re not concerned with motives , with the higher ethics .
we are concerned only with cutting down crime .
and with relieving the ghastly congestion in our prisons .
he will be your true christian . . . . . . ready to turn the other cheek .
ready to be crucified , rather than crucify .
sick to the very heart at the thought even of killing a fly .
reclamation .
joy before the angels of god .
the point is that it works !
and the very next day , your friend and humble narrator ... ... was a free man .
son !
hi , hi , hi there , my pee and em .
mum .
how are you , love ?
nice to see you .
dad .
lad .
what a surprise .
good to see you .
i keeping fit ?
how are you , then ?
i ' m fine , fine .
i keeping out of trouble , you know .
i ' m back !
good to see you .
why didn' t you let us know what was happening ?
i wanted it to be , like , a big surprise for you and pee .
it' s a surprise all right .
a bit bewildering too .
we' ve only just read about it in morning papers .
you should have let us know , lad .
not that we ' re not very pleased to see you again , and all . . . . . . cured too , eh ?
that' s right .
they did a great job on me .
i ' m completely reformed .
still the same old place , then ?
there' s a strange fella sitting on the sofa . . . . . . munchy wunching lomticks of toast .
that' s joe .
he lives here now .
the lodger .
that' s what he is .
he rents your room .
how do you do , joe ?
find the room comfortable , do you ?
no complaints ?
i' ve heard about you .
i know what you' ve done .
breaking the hearts of your poor , grieving parents .
so you ' re back .
back to make life a misery for your lovely parents once more ?
over my dead corpse , you will .
because , you see , they' ve let me be more like a son to them . . . . . . than like a lodger .
don' t go fighting here , boys .
do put your hand over your mouth , please .
it' s bloody revolting .
are you all right ?
it' s the treatment .
it' s disgusting .
enough to put you off your food .
leave him be , joe .
it' s the treatment .
do you think we ought to do something ?
would you like me to make you a nice cup of tea , son ?
what have you done with all me own personal things ?
that was all . . . . . . took away , son .
by the police .
new regulation , see . . . . . . about compensation for the victims .
what about basil ?
where' s my snake ?
he met with . . . . . . like , an accident .
he passed away .
what' s going to happen to me , then ?
i mean . . .
. . . that' s my room he' s in .
there' s no denying that .
this is my home also .
what suggestions have you , my pee and em , to make ?
all this needs thinking about , son .
we can' t very well just kick joe out .
not just like that , can we ?
i mean . . . . . . joe' s here doing a job .
a contract it is .
two years .
we made , like , an arrangement .
didn' t we , joe ?
you see , son . . .
. . . joe' s paid next month' s rent already . . .
. . . so whatever we may do in the future , we can' t just say . . . . . . to get out , now can we ?
no , but it' s much more than that .
i mean , i' ve got you two to think of . . . . . . who' ve been like a father and mother to me .
it wouldn' t be right for me to go off and leave you two . . . . . . to the tender mercies of this young monster . . . . . . who' s been like no real son at all .
look , he' s weeping now .
but that' s all his craft and artfulness .
let him go and find a room somewhere else .
let him learn the errors of his way , and that a bad boy . . . . . . doesn' t deserve such a good mum and dad as he' s had .
all right .
i know how things are now .
i' ve suffered and i' ve suffered . . . . . . and i' ve suffered .
and everybody wants me to go on suffering .
you' ve made others suffer .
it' s only right that you should suffer proper .
i' ve been told everything you' ve done . . . . . . sitting here at night around the table .
and pretty shocking it was to listen to .
it made me real sick , a lot of it did .
now look what you' ve gone and done to your mother .
come on .
it' s all right now .
right .
i ' m leaving now .
you won' t ever viddy me no more .
i' il make me own way .
thank you very much .
let it lie heavy on your consciences .
now , don' t take it like that , son .
can you spare some cutter , me brother ?
can you spare some cutter , me brother ?
can you spare some cutter , me brother ?
thanks , brother .
janie mack !
may the hokey fly !
holy mother of god and all the blessed saints in heaven preserve us !
i never forget a face , be god !
i never forget any face .
leave me alone , brother .
i' ve never seen you before !
this is the poisonous young swine that near done me in .
him and his friends .
they beat me and kicked me and punched me .
stop him !
stop him !
they laughed at me blood and me moans , this murderous dog !
then there was like a sea of dirty , smelly old men ... ... trying to get at your humble narrator ... ... with their feeble rookers and horny old claws .
it was old age having a go at youth .
and i daren' t do a single solitary thing , o my brothers .
it being better to be hit at like that ... ... than want to sick and feel that horrible pain .
all right , all right !
stop it now .
come on .
stop breaking the state' s peace , you naughty boys !
back away !
go away with you !
what' s your trouble , sir ?
well .
well , well , well .
well , well , well , well .
if it isn' t little alex .
long time no viddy , droog .
how goes ?
it' s impossible .
i don' t believe it .
evidence of the old glazzies .
nothing up our sleeves .
no magic , little alex .
the police .
come on , alex .
come for walking .
come , come , come , my little droogies .
i just don' t get this at all .
the old days are dead and gone .
for what i did in the past , i' ve been punished .
i' ve been cured .
that was read out to us .
the inspector read it all out to us .
he said it was a very good way .
but what is all this ?
it was them that went for me , brothers .
you ' re not on their side , and can' t be .
you can' t be , dim .
it was someone we fillied with back in the old days . . . . . . trying to get his own revenge after all this time .
remember ?
a long time is right .
i don' t remember them days , too horrorshow .
and don' t call me dim no more , either .
officer , call me .
enough is remembered , though , little alex .
and this is to make sure you stay cured .
that' s enough .
a bit more .
he' s still kicking .
cured , are you ?
be viddying you some more sometime , droogie .
where was i to go , who had no home and no money ?
i cried for meself .
home , home , home .
it was home i was wanting .
and it was home i came to , brothers ... ... not realizing , in the state i was in ... ... where i was , and had been before .
who on earth could that be ?
i' il see who it is .
yes , what is it ?
please . . . .
frank , i think this young man needs some help .
my god !
what' s happened to you , my boy ?
and would you believe it , o my brothers and only friends ... ... there was your faithful narrator ... ... being held helpless like a babe in arms ... ... and suddenly realizing where he was ... ... and why " home " on the gate had looked so familiar .
but i knew i was safe .
i knew he would not remember me .
for in those carefree days ... ... l and my so called droogs ... ... wore our maskies , which were like real horrorshow disguises .
police .
ghastly , horrible police .
they beat me up , sir .
the police beat me up .
i know you !
isn' t it your picture in the newspapers ?
didn' t i see you on the video this morning ?
are you not the poor victim of this horrible new technique ?
yes , sir .
that' s exactly who i am and what i am , sir .
a victim .
then , by god , you' ve been sent here by providence !
tortured in prison , then tortured by the police .
my heart goes out to you .
you ' re not the first to come here .
the police like to bring their victims to this village .
but it' s providential that you . . . . . . who are also another kind of victim , should come here .
but you ' re cold and shivering .
julian . . . . . . draw a bath for this young man .
certainly , frank .
thank you very much .
god bless you .
i' m singing in the rain
just singing in the rain
he can be the most potent weapon imaginable . . . . . . to ensure the government is not returned in the election .
recruiting young roughs into the police . . . . . . proposing will sapping techniques of conditioning .
we' ve seen it before in other countries .
the thin end of the wedge .
before we know it , we' il have the full apparatus of totalitarianism .
this young boy is a living witness to these diabolical proposals .
the people , the common people , must know , must see .
there are traditions of liberty to defend .
the tradition of liberty is all .
the common people will let it go , yes .
they' il sell liberty for a quieter life .
that is why they must be led .
driven , pushed .
fine .
thank you very much , sir .
he' il be here .
good evening , sir .
good evening .
it was very kind of you to leave this out for me .
there was no one around , so i started .
hope that' s all right , sir .
of course .
food all right ?
great , sir .
great .
try the wine .
thank you , sir .
cheers .
happy days .
won' t you join me ?
my health doesn' t allow it .
no , thank you .
1 960 , chateau .
saint estephe .
medoc .
very good brand .
very good . . . . . . color .
smells nice too .
very nice little number .
here' s to it .
very refreshing , sir .
very refreshing .
i ' m pleased you appreciate good wine .
have another glass .
my wife . . .
. . . used to do everything for me and leave me to my writing .
your wife ?
is she away ?
she' s dead !
i ' m sorry to hear about that .
she was very badly raped , you see .
we were assaulted by vicious young hoodlums . . . . . . in this very room you ' re sitting in now .
i was left a helpless cripple , but for her the agony was too great .
the doctors said it was pneumonia . . . . . . because it happened later , during a flu epidemic .
the doctors told me it was pneumonia , but i knew what it was .
a victim of the modern age .
poor , poor girl .
and now , you .
another victim of the modern age .
but you can be helped .
i phoned some friends while you were having your bath .
some . . . . . . friends ?
they want to help you .
help me ?
help you .
who are they ?
very , very important people .
and they ' re interested in you .
this' il be these people now .
i don' t want to trouble you any further .
i should be leaving .
no trouble at all .
here .
let me fill your glass .
so this is the young man ?
how do you do , sir ?
missus .
i ' m very pleased to meet you .
i hope you forgive us for coming at this hour . . . . . . but we heard you were in trouble . . . . . . and so we came over to see if we could help .
very kind of you , sir .
thank you very much .
i understand you had a rather . . . . . . unfortunate . . . . . . encounter . . . . . . with the police tonight .
yes , i suppose you could call it that .
how are you feeling now ?
much better , thank you .
feel like talking , answering a few questions ?
fine , sir .
fine .
as i said , we' ve heard about you .
we are interested in your case .
we want to help you .
thank you very much .
shall we . . . . . . get down to it ?
fine .
fine , sir .
the newspapers mentioned . . . . . . that in addition to your being conditioned against . . . . . . acts of sex and violence . . . . . . you' ve inadvertently been conditioned against music .
i think that was something that they didn' t plan for .
you see , missus . . . . . . i ' m very fond of music .
especially beethoven .
ludwig van beethoven .
b e  that' s all right .
thank you .
and it just so happened that while they were showing me . . . . . . a particularly bad film of , like , a concentration camp . . . . . . the background music was playing beethoven .
so now you have the same reaction to music . . . . . . as you do to sex and violence ?
no , missus .
you see , it' s not all music .
it' s just the 9th .
you mean beethoven' s 9th symphony ?
that' s right .
i can' t listen to the 9th anymore at all .
when i hear the 9th , i get , like . . . . . . this funny feeling .
and then all i can think about is , like , trying to snuff it .
i beg your pardon ?
snuff it .
death , i mean .
i just want to die peacefully . . . . . . like , with no pain .
do you feel that way now ?
no , sir , not exactly .
i still feel . . . . . . very miserable .
very much down in spirits .
do you still feel . . . . . . suicidal ?
i feel very low in meself .
i can' t see much in the future .
i feel that any second , something terrible is going to happen to me .
well done , frank .
get the car , would you please ?
i woke up .
the pain and sickness all over me like an animal .
then i realized what it was .
the music coming up from the floor ... ... was our old friend ludwig van ... ... and the dreaded 9th symphony .
let me out !
open the door !
come on , open the door !
turn it off !
turn it off !
turn it off !
turn it off !
turn it off !
stop it !
turn it off !
please !
turn it off !
suddenly i viddied what i had to do ... ... and what i had wanted to do .
and that was to do myself in .
to snuff it .
to blast off forever out of this wicked , cruel world .
one moment of pain perhaps ... ... and then , sleep .
forever and ever ... . . . and ever .
i jumped , o my brothers ... ... and i fell hard .
but i did not snuff it .
if i had snuffed it ... ... l would not be here to tell what i told have .
i came back to life after a long , black black gap ... ... of what might have been a million years .
he' s recovered consciousness , doctor .
hello , lad .
hello , son .
how are you ?
are you feeling better ?
what . . . . . . gives . . .
. . . o my pee and em ?
what makes . . . . . . you think . . . . . . you are welcome ?
there , there , mother .
it' s all right .
he doesn' t mean it .
you were in the papers again , son .
it said . . . . . . they had done a great wrong to you .
it said . . . . . . how the government . . . . . . drove you to try . . . . . . and do yourself in .
and when you think about it , son . . .
. . . maybe it was our fault too . . . . . . in a way .
your home' s your home . . . . . . when all' s said and done , son .
good morning .
good morning , doctor .
how are you feeling today ?
fine .
fine .
good .
may l ?
i ' m dr. taylor .
haven' t seen you before .
i ' m your psychiatrist .
psychiatrist !
do i need one ?
just part of hospital routine .
are we going to talk about me sex life ?
i ' m going to show you some slides . . . . . . and you ' re going to tell me what you think about them .
jolly good .
you know anything about dreams ?
something , yes .
you know what they mean ?
perhaps .
you concerned about something ?
no , not concerned , really . . . . . . but i' ve been having this nasty dream .
very nasty .
it' s like . . .
. . . when i was all smashed up , you know . . . . . . and half awake and unconscious like . . . . . . i kept having this dream .
all these doctors were playing around with me gulliver .
you know , like the inside of me brain .
i seem to have this dream over and over again .
do you think it means anything ?
patients with injuries like yours often have dreams of this sort .
it' s all part of the recovery process .
now then , each of these slides needs a reply . . . . . . from one of the people in the picture .
you tell me what you think the person would say .
all right ?
righty right .
isn t the plumage beautiful ?
i just say what the other person would say ?
don' t think about it too long .
say the first thing that pops into your mind .
cabbages .
i knickers .
it' s not got a beak .
good .
the boy you always quarreled with is seriously ill .
my mind is a blank . . .
. . . and i' il smash your face for you , yarblockos .
good .
what do you want ?
no time for the old in out , love .
i' ve just come to read the meter .
good .
you sold me a crummy watch .
i want my money back .
you know what you can do with that watch ?
stick it up your ass !
you can do whatever you like with these .
eggiwegs .
i would like . . . . . . to smash them .
and pick them all up . . . . . . and throw
fucking hell !
there .
that' s all there is to it .
are you all right ?
hope so .
is that the end , then ?
i was quite enjoying that .
good .
i ' m glad .
how many did i get right ?
it' s not that kind of a test .
but you seem well on the way to making a complete recovery .
when do i get out , then ?
i ' m sure it won' t be long now .
so i waited .
and , o my brothers ... ... l got a lot better ... ... munching away at eggiwegs and lomticks of toast ... ... and lovely steakie wakes .
and then one day ... ... they said i was going to have a very special visitor .
just wait outside for a moment , would you , officer ?
i ' m afraid my change of schedule has thrown you .
the patient' s in the middle of supper .
that' s quite all right , minister .
no trouble at all .
good evening , my boy .
hi there , my little droogies .
how ' re you getting on , young man ?
great , sir .
just great .
can i do anything more for you ?
i don' t think so , sir leslie .
then i leave you to it .
nurse .
you seem to have a whole ward to yourself , my boy .
yes , sir .
and a very lonely place it is too . . . . . . when i wake up in the night with me pain .
anyway , good to see you on the mend .
i kept in touch with the hospital , of course .
and now i' ve come down personally . . . . . . to see how you ' re getting along .
i' ve suffered the tortures of the damned .
tortures of the damned .
yes , i can appreciate that you' ve had an extremely dis
oh , look .
let me help you with that , shall i ?
i can tell you that i , and the government of which i ' m a member . . . . . . are deeply sorry about this , my boy .
deeply sorry .
we tried to help you .
we followed recommendations that turned out to be wrong .
an inquiry will place the responsibility where it belongs .
we want you to regard us as friends .
we put you right .
you ' re getting the best of treatment .
we never wished you harm .
but there are some who did , and do .
and i think you know who those are .
there are certain people who wanted to use you for political ends .
they would have been glad to have you dead . . . . . . for they thought they could then blame it on the government .
there is also a certain man . . . . . . a writer of subversive literature . . . . . . who has been howling for your blood .
he' s been mad with desire to stick a knife into you .
but you ' re safe from him now .
we put him away .
he found out that you had done wrong to him .
at least he believed you had done wrong .
he formed this idea in his head that you had been responsible . . . . . . for the death of someone near and dear to him .
he was a menace .
we put him away for his own protection .
and also for yours .
where is he now ?
we put him away where he can do you no harm .
you see , we are looking after your interests .
we are interested in you .
when you leave , you' il have no worries .
we' il see to everything .
a good job on a good salary .
what job and how much ?
you must have an interesting job at a salary you' d regard as adequate .
not only for the job you ' re going to do . . . . . . and in compensation for what you believe you have suffered . . . . . . but also because you are helping us .
helping you ?
we always help our friends , don' t we ?
it is no secret that this government . . . . . . has lost a lot of popularity because of you , my boy .
there are some who think that at the next election we shall be out .
the press has chosen to take a very unfavorable view . . . . . . of what we tried to do .
but public opinion has a way of changing .
and you , alex
if i may call you alex . . . .
certainly .
what do they call you at home ?
my name is frederick .
as i was saying , alex . . . . . . you can be instrumental in changing the public' s verdict .
do you understand , alex ?
do i make myself clear ?
as an unmuddied lake , fred .
as clear as an azure sky of deepest summer .
you can rely on me , fred .
good .
good boy .
i understand you ' re fond of music .
i have arranged a little surprise for you .
surprise ?
one that i hope that you will like . . . . . . as a . . . .
how shall we put it ?
as a symbol of our new understanding .
an understanding between two friends .
