s .
bueno .
family is everything .
no ?
now , do you love your son ?
s .
now ... do you understand ?
you have a $ 10 million insurance policy .
i know that .
georgina !
obey me , i will love you .
come on .
that' s how it works , huh ?
simple .
that' s right .
mwah .
she got a sister ?
how' s business ?
thejapanese are here in a big way .
cheap labor , factory space .
but they feel a lot safer living over the border in el paso .
i ferry them back and forth .
they think i' m john wayne .
ah .
come on .
i live like a king down here .
yes , you do .
you been workin ' ?
yeah .
no .
nah .
been movin ' around , you know .
colombia , couple of places i can' t name .
nothing catches my fancy .
oh .
you think god will forgive us for what we' ve done ?
no .
you don' t ?
me either .
how long you staying ?
i don' t know .
i just ... you know .
i wanted to see you , ray , see how you' re doin ' .
you know , i came by on impulse .
well , i could do with some impulse .
what happened ?
family paid the ransom ... then they sent the kid home after a couple of days ... minus an ear , of course .
now every mother in mexico city with a little bit of money wants bigger and better bodyguards ... my own wife included .
i hate to break it to you , but she' s right .
she' s right .
look , sammy , all my clients have , uh , kidnap and ransom insurance .
i have a policy .
a. i. g. my dad gave it to me .
yeah , i know .
i got it for your dad .
but what are you gonna do in 60 days when you can' t renew it ?
you can' t because you don' t have a bodyguard .
i had to let emilio go .
you gotta please lisa .
i mean , hey , ass like that' s hard to find .
look , a bodyguard' s like anything else .
you get what you pay for , okay ?
you could do this .
you get one that' s got a decent rsum .
we' re not looking for goddamn superman here , right ?
get someone cheap till you renew the policy ... and then , uh ... then fire the prick for whatever .
incompetence .
all kidding aside , the most important thing is that your daughter goes back to school ... and that your wife gets to save face .
this way , you won' t be the only unprotected family in the neighborhood .
that' s right .
a bodyguard .
your spanish is good enough .
you' re crazy .
you even look the part .
in my state , i couldn' t guard a corpse .
it' s rich guys flashing their cash .
it' s all for show .
nothing' s gonna happen .
yeah ?
you think they' d hire a drunk , a has been ?
you have to keep it under control .
what if there was , you know , say , a kidnapping attempt ?
what do i do then ?
you do your best .
they' re not gonna be paying you enough to perform miracles .
i don' t know .
it' s not exactly a scam , crease .
even at half speed , you' re pretty damn good .
yeah .
bodyguard' s gotta be close to people though .
he gotta talk all the time , and i' m no good at that .
you' il be the silent type .
people are gonna appreciate that .
bodyguard .
so who' s the guy ?
samuel ramos .
he' s a young guy .
he owns one of the plants in jurez .
yeah ?
thejap car industry is in the toilet .
he' s trying to persuade ford to partner with him .
i think he' s in trouble .
his family lives in mexico city .
he asked me if i knew anybody he could trust .
and you thought of me .
yeah .
take a job , crease .
breathe some air .
then decide if you want to stick around or not .
besides , i' m glad to see you .
i got nobody to talk to down here .
listen , my wife wants someone presentable and polite .
you' il be the fifth candidate she sees this week .
your rsum' s quite impressive .
sixteen years of military experience , extensive counterterrorism work .
i' m surprised anybody could afford you .
what' s the catch ?
i drink .
how does that affect you ?
well ... coordination , reaction time .
if top professionals try to kidnap your daughter , i' il do the best i can ... but the service will be on par with the pay .
what if amateurs tried ?
i' d probably kill ' em .
is that likely ?
no .
no one is to know about your drinking .
that includes my wife .
lisa . !
lisa !
people chanting ]
my wife , lisa .
and this is john creasy .
you' re an american .

no state in particular .
you can drive and talk at the same time .
no , i can' t , pita , so , please , let me just do my job .
are you going to stay ?
my last bodyguard left .
somebody gave him more money than we could .
i guess that makes me a bargain then , huh ?
being black ... is that a positive or negative for a bodyguard in mexico ?
time will tell .
there were 2 4 kidnappings in mexico city in the last six days .
four a day .
yeah ?
twenty four ?

i don' t remember .
you don' t remember ?
