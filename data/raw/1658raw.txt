catching a breath of air , sir .
my dear .
she is very beautiful , harry .
yes , she is , sir .
i was thinking how proud my father would be if he were here .
an officer who gave his life for his country deserves far more respect than i do .
i wish i' d met him .
are you ready , my dear ?
with all my heart .
my lords , ladies and gentlemen , the general .
dr. johnson once said every man feels meanly about himself for not having been a soldier .
well , that' s something no one here tonight need fear .
whether or not you' ve seen active service you have shown yourselves willing to lay down your lives and for that ...
i salute you .
the royal cumbrians !
the royal cumbrians !
now , in my mind , there is only one sacrifice more noble than pledging one' s life for one' s country and that is ... loving ... and marrying a man who does .
marry ? !
marry ? !
harry ... and ethne .
harry and ethne !
bravo !
bravo !
bravo !
form a square !
form a square !
well , now that we' ve had such a public engagement can we have a nice , quiet wedding , please ?

i want the full works , the church near my home and then a rousing speech from your father .
mm .
my father ?
mm hmm .
mm hmm .
i' d like to congratulate my son .
when i was his age , i was in charge of a full regiment .
he doesn' t sound anything like that .
oh , yes , he does .
besides , you will be in charge of a regiment .
quiet !
it' il be jack and isabelle' s turn next .
jack ?
oh , no , jack will never get married .
he' s too much of a soldier .
so are you .

come on !
gentlemen , the colonel !
gentlemen .
i have some news .
an army of muhammadan fanatics under the command of their self proclaimed messiah , the mahdi has attacked a british fortress in the sudan .
our forces there fought a heroic but in the end hopeless , rearguard action .
they were slaughtered to a man .
as a result of these hostilities several regiments , including the royal cumbrians will be shipping out to the sudan within the week .
congratulations to you all .
this government has finally seen fit to send its soldiers to war .
finally , we' re off .
gentlemen .
god has endowed the british race with a worldwide empire that they may execute
his sovereign purpose in the world .
the victories you will have over the heathen are the victories of the nobler soul in man .
god save the queen .
god save the queen !
all together !
this is what nerves do to grown men .
if we' re going to go to war , i wish we' d just get on with it .
do you ever think about what it' s going to be like when we get there ?
all the time .
don' t you ?
i sometimes wonder what a godforsaken desert in the middle of nowhere has to do with her majesty the queen .
what' s going on ?
what happened ?
aren' t you afraid you won' t come back ?
did you have a bad dream about me or something ?
did i get my head lopped off by one of those mahdi savages ?
yes , jack .
of course , i' m scared .
then , what ... ... what makes you go ?
i suppose ...
i' m going because you' re going ... you , trench , castleton , even willoughby ... but especially you .
there' s no one i' d sooner trust my life with .
what is this ?
my papers , sir .
if it' s leave you want , there' s a different procedure .
normally i wouldn' t consider it in the circumstances but given that you' ve just got engaged ...
it isn' t leave i want , sir .
i wish to resign my commission .
if i were you , i' d think very carefully about what you' re saying , lieutenant .
i' ve made up my mind , sir .
we' il talk about this when you' ve spoken with your father .
it isn' t his decision , sir .
i do not accept these papers , lieutenant and i do not accept that one of my men would walk out on his regiment ...
sir ... ... the very week we are shipping off to war !
now , as far as i' m concerned , you were never here .
you can thank your father for that .
sir ...
i wish to resign my commission .
please leave these barracks immediately .
whoa !
hello , miss willoughby !
i thought i could smell the scent of fresh roses in the air .
harry' s resigned .
resigned what ?
his bloody commission , what do you think ?
what did hamilton do ?
refuse him leave to marry ethne ?
hamilton didn' t do anything .
there was no excuse for it .
excuse for it " ?
you' re talking about harry .
he' s right , tom .
he' s just got engaged .
it' s perfectly natural to have doubts .
we' re sent to war , and the very next day he resigns ?
there' s no doubt about it .
what' s that supposed to mean ?
i think it' s perfectly clear what it means .
tom , don' t be absurd .
shut up , vicar .
it means he' s a coward , jack .
then say that to his face .
i would' ve done only he left the barracks before i had a chance .
all right , then , say it to my face .
easy , jack .
harry' s a disgrace !
he' s disgraced the regiment !
jack !
he' s the best soldier in the regiment !
obviously not when it counts .
get off !
i will tell him but not to his face ... he doesn' t deserve it .
he deserves to be treated with the same contempt that he treated us .
what contempt ?
did he talk to you about it ?
did he talk to any of you ?
he' s left our backs exposed and he doesn' t even have the courage to tell us .
he was my friend , too , jack .
he' il be there .
this has to be answered .
do you , harry faversham take this woman to be your lawful , wedded wife ?
yes , and you may kiss the bride .
you can' t jump ahead like that .
you have to let me enjoy my wedding .
oh .
it' s your fault we won' t be able to do the real one for another six months .
there' s no reason why we can' t get married whenever we like , is there ?
i' ve heard that before .
i' ve left the army .
no , ethne , i ...
i have ... left the army .
why ?
well , there was talk they may send us abroad ... for a year or two .
i didn' t want to wait that long to get married .
well , i would' ve waited ... or come with you .
my mother did the same for my father .
yes , i know , but it isn' t what i wanted for us .
you' re all that matters to me now .
where were they going to send you ?
they weren' t sure .
mr. faversham .
is this your friends ' idea of a joke ?
what is it , harry ?
feathers of ... of cowardice .
yesterday , we ... were informed that our regiment would be shipping out to the sudan ... ... that we would be ... sent to war .
you don' t know where they were sending you ... you said so yourself ... and you did it for me .
ethne ...
nobody in their right minds could call you a coward , especially not your friends .
there' s been some kind of misunderstanding .
you have to clear it up .
you have to go back to the regiment and clear it up .
no , i can' t .
then i will .
i' il go see trent , willoughby and castleton myself and tell them it' s my fault you resigned that you did it for me .
it has nothing to do with you , ethne !
then why ?
i never wanted to join the army !
i did it for my father .
i thought i' d serve out my commission in a year or two keep everyone happy , and then i could just ...
you' d what , wait till we were married to tell me the truth ?
no , ethne , l i never meant to lie to you .
no , but you were quite happy to let me deceive myself .
do you think people will let us forget this ?
i don' t care what people think , ethne .
all i care about is us .
it' s not about us , harry .
it' s not just about us .
what about jack ?
he would give his life for you .
don' t you think i know that ?
then go back .
it' s not too late .
tell them you wouldn' t have resigned if it weren' t for me .
i would ... have resigned ...
... and i wouldn' t have gone to war for anything or anyone .
then you are a coward .
fight for england !
avoid drinking local water and spirits
avoid local barrooms and brothels and , above all , remember , you' re a christian soldier .
why' d they give this to me ?
it must be for you , vicar .
father ?
after you .
may i speak with you , sir ?
i don' t know you .
i need to speak with you , sir .
british attack the city of korti !
british casualties in the sudan !
something wrong , jack ?
well , i don' t know about you lot but i' m going to get a drink before mustafa does .
it' s probably poisoned .
mustafa , after you , mate .
take cover !
stay down !
take cover !
take cover !
where is he ?
get down and stay down !
get down !
take cover !
where is he ?
where is he ?
take cover !
stay down !
stay down , everyone !
find him !
find him !
where the bloody hell is he ?
he' s on the roof !
where ? !
over there !
over there !
get him !
now !
move !
right , sir .
hey !
put the gun down .
put the gun down .
put the gun down !
tell him to put the gun down !
put your gun down !
for god sakes , man , put your gun down !
don' t .
hold your fire .
put the gun down .
tell him to put his gun down !
don' t !
don' t !
don' t !
what' s done is done , harry .
no , sir it isn' t .
something like this happens ... ... and you' re lost .
you don' t know who you are anymore or what you' re capable of .
unless i do something ... this is how people will always remember me ... a feather ... and that is how i will always see myself ... a coward .
all i know is i can' t live with myself like this .
who gave you the fourth feather ?
jack durrance ?
no , sir .
ethne did .
forgive me for all the shame i' ve caused you .
i can only imagine the indignities you must have suffered because of me .
i hope my leaving london will at least allow you to begin your life again , free of my shadow .
i have no right to your trust or claim to your love but please believe , i never set out to deceive you .
i don' t know if an opportunity will ever arise to redeem myself but i have to believe it will and i have to believe that this time i' il face up to my fears and prove to myself and others , i' m not a coward .
what did he pay you to bring him here ?
listen , gustave , i wouldn' t bring ...
take this .
now get out .
don' t come back .
what do you want ?
can you take me to the british camp at korti ?
across the desert ?
yes .
why ?
can you take me there or not ?
for your time .
can you speak arabic ?
i can learn .
yes , but can you learn to look like an arab ?
if the mahdi' s men find you ...
i' m taking a caravan of whores up to korti next week .
come and see me then .
left , right , left , right , left , right , left .
thank you .
left , right , left , right , left , right , left .
congratulations , jack .
i' ve decided to give you a few weeks ' leave .
every report i receive singles you out for praise .
you and several other officers will be going to london to convince parliament and the public opinion that it' s high time this government ordered us out of korti to rescue general gordon .
with your permission , i' d rather stay here with the regiment .
why ?
i don' t feel i' ve done my duty yet .
i wouldn' t want to let the others down .
permission refused .
sir , why me ?
because you' re a hero , jack .
with all due respect , sir
i don' t think we' ve been fighting long enough to have any heroes in this campaign .
shut up !
keep them quiet , saadi !
what do i pay you for ? !
they are princesses .
can you imagine even the savages have royalty ?
but the british soldiers pay me three dirham an hour for them .
well worth the trip to korti .
is this the mahdi' s territory ?
everywhere is mahdi territory .
mm .
mm .
what is it ?
she doesn' t like my manners ?
savage !
stop it !
you' re not to look at me !
stop !
stop doing this !
stop it !
stop it !
stop it !
i' il teach you manners !
stop it !
enough !
that' il teach you manners !
enough !
you think she' il thank you for what you did today ?
i don' t expect her to .
of course you do ; you saved her life .
tsk , tsk !
tsk !
they' re like children .
they have no concept of gratitude or loyalty .
that' s something you british don' t understand .
you come here , trying to civilize them with your christian values .
now , she' il thank you .
don' t be so proud , my friend .
there are followers of the mahdi everywhere in the sudan .
the rebel tribes are gathering forces under the leadership of the mahdi to fight us .
we do not need more reinforcements .
all we need is for this government to give an order to march and we will route the enemy and preserve the dignity of our empire .
have you heard from harry ?
no .
have you ?
no .
ethne , you can' t blame yourself .
you make a stupid mistake and you pay for it for the rest of your life .
i can' t forgive myself .
you had your reasons .
what reasons ?
pride ?
because i was afraid of what people would say .
what do i care what people said ?
i loved him .
ethne , you have to ...
he came to me , jack .
he came to me and i turned him away .
it' s all right .
it won' t be like this for the rest of your life .
i' il write to you when i' m gone .
left , right , left , right , left , right , left .
left , right , left , right , left , right , left .
left , right , left , right , left , right , left , right
left , right , stop !
referee , come on !
that wasn' t fair !
congratulations !
open up .
he' s got no teeth .
get rid of him .
who' s next ? !
come on , keep ' em coming , keep ' em coming .
no , he' s too small .
i want to see this man' s teeth .
he looks strong enough .
put him with the baggage porters .
how many more we got ?
how many , bill ?
okay , we need another three of them .
what' s going on ? !
this man comes from a tribe of slaves .
the men will not serve with him , sir .
look , we need all the help we can get .
baggage porter !
get him through .
i can' t believe it .
come on .
come on .
get him through .
come on , next .
i was so relieved to receive your last letter .
while the whole country is celebrating your campaign against the mahdi all i feel is dread and all i think about are the precious times we spent together : you , harry , and i.
my father used to say that god takes away what' s dearest to our hearts to remind us how much we take for granted .
now that it' s too late , i wish i could turn back time .
how differently i' d do things given a second chance .
take good care of yourself , jack .
i don' t mind if you don' t come back covered in glory .
just come back safely .
your friend forever , ethne .
thoughtful of general wolseley to give us these umbrellas , eh , vicar ?
i burn in the sun .
come on , now , faster !
faster !
watch out !
abou fatma .
my name is abou fatma .
vedu .
i was a scout for general hicks .
there are many in this camp who serve the mahdi .
when they find out there' s a british spy amongst them watching them , they' il kill him .
it won' t be long , vedu .
why would you warn me ?
for money .
i can' t pay you .
what' s the feather for ?
first time i killed a man .
five men .
wait .
ten men .
this ...
i will wear soon .
i' m a good soldier .
i ... will protect you .
who did this ? !
who did this ? !
who did this ? !
who did this ? !
keep your eyes to the front .
why would a british spy be hiding from his own soldiers ?
i' m not a spy .
is that the same letter you read over and over again or do you get a different one each day ?
he writes them to himself .
read us a line .
read your own .
don' t be so coy .
you' re amongst friends .
come on , jack , you can trust us .
i' m so glad i came to hear you speak that day in london .
come on , more than that .
don' t leave us hanging on ... elaborate .
it made me realize how much your friendship means to me .
come back safely and soon ... my dearest jack .
ooh !
well , well done , " my dearest jack " !
who' s the lucky lady ?
ethne .
i' m going to ask her to marry me .
congratulations , jack .
that' s fantastic , jack .
she hasn' t said yes .
aah , she will .
i realize how much i bloody love you .
how much your friendship means to me .
same thing .
cheers , jack .
congratulations , jack .
they look like the mahdi' s men .
i need to find out where he' s going .
deserters , sir .
corporal , cease fire !
harry .
looks like they' ve stopped for the night .
why is it so important to follow them ?
the mahdi spies will report on our troop movements .
not the spies ... ... your friends .
to help them ... if i can .
are you a deserter ?
something like that .
i was sent to fight , and i ran away .
why ?
why ?
well ...
i just ...
there are many reasons why .
mostly , i was afraid .
i found you half dead ... ... crossing the desert alone .
you say you are afraid ?
it' s a different kind of fear .
why are you protecting me ?
god put you in my way .
i have no choice .
god ?
hmm .
an englishman and a christian .
you must' ve done something terrible to offend him .
you laugh like an englishman .
and how does an englishman laugh ?
abou ... they' re leaving !
they' re getting away .
we can' t lose them .
all right , i' il ...
i' il just sit here and wait for you .
take your time .
oh .
that is the fortress of abou clea .
the british reinforcements are stationed there .
why would the spies be going to a british fort ?
the fort has been taken over by the mahdi' s army .
but this is where our troops are heading .
abou !
abou , warn my friends .
company , halt !
company , halt !
company , halt !
hyah !
hyah !
hyah , hyah , hyah , hyah .
hyah .
whoa !
god ...
hyah !
hyah !
mr. trench !
william !
get away from them !
leave them alone !
you filthy ...
sir ?
you leave these bloody men alone !
hyah !
hyah !
come back here !
go on !
oh ...
sir .
the egyptians have captured an enemy scout .
where did you find this man ?
i came to you myself .
the mahdi' s men have captured your fort at abou clea .
this man is lying , sir .
he' s the one who stole the camels ...
they will attack you here !
tell him a british garrison would never fall to the mahdi savages !
ask him if he knows the penalty for being a spy .
i' m not a spy .
the mahdi' s men have left these bodies to keep you here .
tell him i' il bury him alive if he speaks another word of english !
ask him who sent him here and why .
he says a british officer sent him , sir .
a general , no doubt .
what was his name ?
come here , son .
i' il show you a british officer .
this is a british officer !
and this ... is a british officer' s blood .
now lick it up ... every bloody drop !
look !
don' t be rash !
take him away .
find out why the enemy sent him .
use any means necessary .
the muslims always bury their dead , even the enemy dead .
these bodies have been left here for a reason !
come on , you !
look , i think you should tell hamilton .
i agree , tom .
what for ?
as a precaution , tom .
this man was trying to mislead us .
i' ve made my decision .
i' m not going to waste the colonel' s time by sending some half naked savage in front of him with a tall tale .
what is it , jack ?
there' s something up .
