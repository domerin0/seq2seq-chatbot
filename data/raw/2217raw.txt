healthy choice and american airlines got together for this promotion ...
if you buy any 10 of healthy choice products they' il reward you 500 frequent flyer miles ... ... with a special coupon they' il up it to a 1000 miles .
so i think they' re trying to push their teriyaki chicken which is 1 . 79 usd ...
but i went to the supermarket , i looked arround and i saw that they had pudding at 0 . 25 usd/ cup .
comes in packages of four , but insanely ... ... the barcodes are on the individual cups !
so , a quarter of a cup ... say you bought 2 . 50 usd worth ...
that' s worth 500 miles , ... with the coupon it' s a 1000 miles ...
it' s a marketing mistake but i' m taking advantage of it .
if you already spent 3000 usd ... that will get you a million frequent flyer miles ... ... you would never have to pay for a ticket for the rest of your life !
so you put a lot pudding so you can get free coupons .
yes .
that' s insane !
i' m guessing it was a mistake ... but i' m taking advantage of the wallets offered .
