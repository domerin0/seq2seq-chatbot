do you find me sadistic ?
you know , kiddo ... ... i' d like to believe ... ... you' re aware enough , even now ... ... to know that there' s nothing sadistic ... ... in my actions .
at this moment ... ... this is me ... ... at my most masochistic .
bill .
it' s your ba ...
looked dead , didn' t i ?
well , i wasn' t .
but it wasn' t from lack of trying , i can tell you that .
actually , bill' s last bullet put me in a coma a coma i was to lie in for four years .
when i woke up , i went on what the movie advertisements refer to as
a roaring rampage of revenge .
i roared , and i rampaged , and i got bloody satisfaction .
i' ve killed a hell of a lot of people to get to this point , but i' ve only one more .
the last one .
the one i' m driving to right now .
the only one left .
and when i arrive at my destination ,
i am gonna kill bill .
the incident that happened at the two pines wedding chapel that put this whole gory story into motion has since become legend .
massacre at two pines .
that' s what the newspapers called it .
the local tvnews called it ,
the el paso , texas wedding chapel massacre .
how it happened , who was there , how many got killed and who killed them changes depending on who' s telling the story .
in actual fact , the massacre didn' t happen during a wedding at all .
it was a wedding rehearsal .
now , when we come to the part where i say ,
you may kiss the bride , " you may kiss the bride .
but don' t stick your tongue in her mouth .
this might be funny to your friends , but it would be embarrassing to your parents .
we' il try to restrain ourselves , reverend .
y' all got a song ?
how ' bout " love me tender " ?
i can play that .
sure .
yeah .
love me tender " would be great .
rufus he' s the man .
rufus , who was that that you used to play for ?
rufus thomas .
rufus thomas .
rufus thomas .
i was a drell .
i was a drifter .
i was a coaster .
i was part of the gang .
i was a barkay .
if they come through texas , i done played with ' em .
rufus he' s the man .
have i forgotten anything ?
um ...
oh yes , you forgot , uh , the seating arrangements .
thank you , mother .
yes .
now , the way we normally do this we have the bride' s side , and then we have the groom' s side .
but since the bride ain' t got nobody comin ' , and the groom' s got far too many people comin ' ...
well , yeah , they' re comin ' all the way from oklahoma .
right ...
well , i don' t see no problem with ... ... the groom' s side sharing the bride' s side .
do you , mother ?
i don' t have a problem with that .
but , uh ...
honey , you know , it would be good if you had somebody come .
you know , as a sign of good faith ?
well , i don' t have anybody ... ... except for tommy and my friends .
you have no family ?
well , i' m workin ' on changing that .
mrs. harmony , we' re all the family this little angel' s ever gonna need .
i' m not feeling very well , and this bitch is starting to piss me off .
so while y' all blather on , i' m gonna go outside and get some air .
ok .
um , uh , reverend , sorry , uh ...
she' s gonna go out and get some air .
yeah .
given her delicate condition ...
she just needs a few minutes to get it together .
she' il be ok .
right ...
hello , kiddo .
how did you find me ?
i' m the man .
what are you doin ' here ?
what am i doin ' ?
well ... ... moment ago i was playin ' my flute .
at this moment ... ... i' m lookin ' at the most beautiful bride these old eyes have ever seen .
why are you here ?
last look .
are you gonna be nice ?
i' ve never been nice in my whole life .
but i' il do my best to be sweet .
hmm .
i always told you ... ... your sweet side is you best side .
i guess that' s why you' re the only one who' s ever seen it .
so you got a bun in the oven .
hmm .
i' m knocked up .
jeez , louise .
that young man of yours sure doesn' t believe in wasting time , does he ?
have you seen tommy ?
big guy in the tux ?
yes .
then i saw him .
i like his hair .
you promised you' d be nice .
no , i said i' d do my best .
that' s hardly a promise .
but you' re right .
what does your young man do for a living ?
he owns a used record store here in el paso .
ah .
music lover , eh ?
he' s fond of music .
aren' t we all ?
and what are you doing for a j o b these days ?
i work in the record store .
aso .
it all suddenly seems so clear .
do you like it ?
yeah .
i like it a lot , smartass .
i get to listen to music all day ... ... talk about music all day .
it' s really cool .
it' s gonna be a great environment for my little girl to grow up in .
as opposed to jetting around the world , killing human beings , and being paid vast sums of money ?
precisely .
well , my old friend ... ... to each his own .
however , all cockblockery aside ...
i am looking forward to meeting your young man .
i happen to be , more or less , particular whom my gal marries .
you want to come to the wedding ?
only if i can sit on the bride' s side .
you' il find it a bit lonely on my side .
your side always was a bit lonely .
but i wouldn' t sit anywhere else .
you know ... ... i had the loveliest dream about you ...
oh , here' s tommy !
call me arlene .
you must be tommy !
uh huh .
arlene' s told me so much about you .
honey , you ok ?
oh , i' m fine .
tommy , i' d like you to meet my father .
oh , my god !
oh , my god , this is great !
i' m so glad to meet you , sir ... uh , dad .
the name' s bill .
well , it' s great to meet you ...
bill .
arlene told me you couldn' t make it .
surprise .
that' s my pop for ya .
always full of surprises .
well , in the surprise department ... ... the apple doesn' t fall far from the tree .
when did you get in ?
just now .
did you come straight from australia ?
of course .
daddy , i told tommy that you were in perth mining for silver , and ... ... no one could reach you .
lucky for us all , that' s not the case .
so ...
what' s this all about ?
i' ve heard of wedding rehearsals , but i don' t believe i' ve ever heard of a wedding dress rehearsal before .
we thought ,
why pay so much money for a dress you' re only gonna wear once ?
especially when arlene looks so goddamn beautiful in it .
so , i think we' re gonna try to get all the mileage we can out of it .
isn' t it supposed to be bad luck for the groom to see the bride in her wedding dress before the ceremony ?
well , i guess i just believe in living dangerously .
i know just what you mean .
son .
some of us have places to be .
sure do .
look , we got to go through this one more time .
so , why don' t you have a s ...
oh , my god .
what am i thinking ?
you should give her away !
tommy , that' s not exactly daddy' s cup of tea .
i think father would be much more comfortable
sitting with the rest of the guests .
hmm .
really ?
that' s asking a lot .
oh .
ok .
well , forget it .
but how about we go out to dinner tonight to celebrate ?
only on the condition that i pay for everything .
deal .
we got to do this now .
can i watch ?
absolutely .
have a seat .
which is the bride' s side ?
right over here .
mother , here we go !
now son , about them vows ...
bill ...
i just want ...
you don' t owe me a damn thing .
if he' s the man you want ... ... then go stand by him .
do i look pretty ?
oh , yes .
thank you .
what the hell ?
no !
bill !
you tellin ' me she cut her way through 88 bodyguards before she got to o ren ?
nah , there wasn' t really 88 of ' em .
they just called themselves " the crazy 88
how come ?
i don' t know .
i guess they thought it sounded cool .
anyhow , they all fell under her hanzo sword .
she got a hanzo sword ?
he made one for her .
didn' t he swear a blood oath to never make another sword ?
it would appear he has broken it .
them japs sure know how to hold a grudge , don' t they ?
or maybe ... ... you just tend to bring that out in people .
i know this is a ridiculous question before i ask it , but you haven' t , by any chance , kept up with your ... swordplay ?
i , um ...
i pawned that years ago .
you hocked a hattori hanzo sword ?
yep .
it was priceless .
well , not in el paso , it ain' t .
in el paso , i got me $250 for it .
i' m a bouncer in a titty bar , bill .
if she wants to fight with me , all she' s got to do is come down to the club and start some shit , and we' il be in a fight .
i know we haven' t spoken in some time , and the last time we spoke wasn' t the most pleasant , but you' ve got to get over being mad at me , and start becoming afraid of , because she is coming , and she' s coming to kill you .
and unless you accept my assistance , i have no doubt she will succeed .
i don' t dodge guilt , and i don' t jew out of paying my comeuppance .
can' t we just ... forget the past ?
that woman ... ... deserves her revenge .
and ... ... we deserve to die .
but then again ... ... so does she .
so i guess ... ... we' il just see .
won' t we ?
late again .
budd , can' t you tell time ?
there ain' t nobody in here , man .
is that budd ?
yeah .
tell him to get his fucking ass back here !
ok .
budd , larry' d like a word with ya .
take a hit .
be somebody , baby .
you looking for me ?
i don' t know what car wash you worked before you came here that let you stroll in 20 minutes late , but it wasn' t owned by me
and i own a fuckin ' car wash .
do you want me to leave ?
no , i don' t want you to leave .
i want you to sit and wait .
larry ... ... there ain' t nobody out there , so ...
there' s nobody out there , larry .
what' s your point ?
that you' re not needed here ?
my point is ... ... i' m the bouncer , and there ain' t nobody out there to bounce .
you saying that the reason ... ... that you' re not doing the job that i' m ... ... paying you to do is that you don' t have a job to do ?
no ...
is that what you' re saying ?
what are you trying to convince me of , exactly ?
that you' re as useless as an asshole right here ?
well , guess what , buddy ?
i think ... you just fucking convinced me .
let' s go to the calendar .
it' s calendar time .
calendar time for buddy .

till i call you .
before you leave , talk to rocket .
she' s got a job for you to do .
and ... ... the hat .
that fuckin ' hat .
that fucking ...
how many times have i told you , don' t wear that fucking hat here ?
how many ?
customers wear hats .
well , i' m not the boss of the customers .
i' m the boss of you .
and i' m telling you ... ... that i want you to keep that shit kicker hat at home .
yeah .
budd , honey , uh , the toilet is at it again .
there' s shitty water all over the floor .
ok ...

i' il clean it up .
mm hmm .
how many times
have you heard someone say ,
if i had his money ,
i could do things my way
but little they know
that it' s so hard to find
one rich man in ten
with a satisfied mind
once i was wading
in fortune and fame
everything that i dreamed for
to get a start in life' s game
then suddenly it happened
i lost every dime , but i' m richer ...
how many times
have you heard someone say ...
now ... ... that gentled you down some , didn' t it ?
yep .
ain' t nobody a badass with a double dose of rock salt dug deep in her tits .
not havin ' ... tits ...

i can' t even imagine how bad that shit must sting .
yet ...
... i don' t want to , neither .

ugh !
ugh .
bill .

budd .
bingo .
and to what do i owe this dubious pleasure ?
i just caught me the cowgirl ain' t never been caught .

well , not yet , i ain' t .
i shot her full of rock salt .
she' s so gentle right now , i could perform her coup de grce with a rock .
anywho ...

what ?
a brand spankin' new hattori hanzo sword .
and i' m here to tell ya , elle , ... that' s what i call sharp .
how much ?
oh , that' s hard to say , bein ' that it' s ... priceless and all .
what' s the terms ?
you get your bony ass down here first thing in the morning ... ... with a million dollars in folding cash ... ... and i' il give you the greatest sword ever made by a man .
now , how do you like the sound of that ?
sounds like we got a deal .
one condition .
what ?
she must suffer to her last breath .
well ...
that , elle darlin ' ... ... i can pretty much damn well guarantee .
then i' il see you in the mornin ' , millionaire .
all right .
wakey , wakey .
eggs and bakey .
i' m done !
get me outta this hole !
good .
whew .
whoa , look at those eyes .
this bitch is furious .
what did i tell ya ?
is she the cutest little blond pussy you ever saw ?
or ... is she the cutest little blond pussy you ever saw ?
i seen better .
you got anything to say ?
white women call this " the silent treatment .
and we let ' em think we don' t like it .
you grab the feet , i' il get the head .
hey .
hey .
hey !
wiggle worm , you see this ?
you see it , don' t ya ?
that' s a can of mace .
mm hmm .
no .
you' re goin ' underneath the ground tonight .
and ... that' s all there is to it .
i wanna bury ya .
i was gonna bury ya ...
... with this .
but if you' re gonna act like a horse' s ass ... ... i' m gonna spray this whole goddamn can right in your eyeballs !
i' il burn ' em right outta your fuckin ' head .
then you' re gonna be blind ... ... and burnin ' ... ... and buried alive .
now , what' s it gonna be , sister ?
that' s a wise decision .
this is for breakin ' my brother' s heart .
once upon a time ... ... in china ... ... some believe around the year ... ... one double aught three , head priest of the white lotus clan , pai mei , was walking down a road ... ... contemplating whatever it is that a man of pai mei' s infinite powers would contemplate which is another way of saying , " who knows ? " when a shaolin monk appeared on the road , traveling in the opposite direction .
as the monk and the priest crossed paths ... ... pai mei ... ... in a practically unfathomable display of generosity , gave the monk the slightest of nods .
the nod ... ... was not returned .
now , was it the intention of the shaolin monk to insult pai mei ?
or did he just fail to see the generous social gesture ?
the motives of the monk remain unknown .
what is known ... ... were the consequences .
the next morning , pai mei appeared at the shaolin temple ... ... and demanded of the temple' s head abbot that he offer pai mei his neck to repay the insult .
the abbot , at first , tried to console pai mei .
only to find pai mei was ... ... inconsolable .
so began ... ... the massacre of the shaolin temple , and all sixty of the monks inside , at the fists of the white lotus .
and ... so began the legend ... ... of pai mei' s five point palm exploding heart technique .
and what , pray tell , is the five point palm
exploding heart technique ?
quite simply , the deadliest blow in all of martial arts .
he hits you with his fingertips ... ... at five different pressure points on your body ... ... and then lets you walk away .
but once you' ve taken five steps ... ... your heart explodes inside your body ... ... and you fall to the floor , dead .
did he teach you that ?
no .
he teaches no one the five point palm exploding heart technique .
now ... ... one of the things i' ve always liked about you ... ... kiddo ... ... is you appear wise beyond your years .
whatever ... ... whatever pai mei says , obey .
if you flash him , even for an instant , a defiant eye , he' il pluck it out .
and if you throw any american sass his way ... ... he' il snap your back and your neck like they were twigs .
and that will be the story of you .
he' il accept you as his student .
what happened to you ?
nothin ' .
get in a fight ?
friendly contest .
why did he accept me ?
because he' s a very , very , very old man .
and like all rotten bastards ... ... when they become old , they get lonely .
which has no effect on their dispositions , but it does teach them the value of company .
whew .
oh .
just seein ' those steps again makes me ache .
you' re gonna have a lot of fun carrying buckets of water up and down that fucker .
when will i see you again ?
that' s the title of my favorite soul song of the seventies .
what ?
nothin ' .
when he tells me you' re done .
when do you think that might be ?
that , my dearest , depends entirely on you .
now remember , no sarcasm , no backtalk .
at least not for the first year or so .
you' re gonna have to let him warm up to you .
he hates caucasians , despises americans , and has nothing but contempt for women .
so in your case ... it might take a little while .
adis .
master ...
your mandarin is lousy .
it causes my ears discomfort .
you bray like an ass !
you are not to speak unless spoken to .
is it too much to hope ... you understand cantonese ?
i speak japanese very well ...
i didn' t ask if you speak japanese ...
i asked if you understand cantonese ?
a little .
you are here to learn the mysteries of kung fu , not linguistics .
if you can' t understand me ...
i will communicate with you like i would a dog .
when i yell , when i point , when i beat you with my stick !
bill is your master , is he not ?
yes , he is .
your master tells me ... you' re not entirely unschooled .
what training do you possess ?
i am proficient in tiger crane style , and i am more than proficient in the exquisite art of the samurai sword .
the exquisite art of the samurai sword .
don' t make me laugh !
your so called exquisite art , is only fit for ...
japanese fat heads !
your anger amuses me .
do you believe you are my match ?
no .
are you aware i kill at will ?
yes .
is it your wish to die ?
no .
then you must be stupid ...
then you must be stupid ... so stupid .
rise , and let me look at your ridiculous face .
rise .
so my pathetic friend ...
is there anything that you can do well ?
what' s the matter ?
cat got your tongue ?
oh yes , you speak japanese .
i despise the goddamn japs !
go to that rack .
remove the sword .
let' s see how good you really are .
lf ... ... you land a single blow ,
i' il bow down and call you master .
from here you can get an excellent view of my foot .
your swordsmanship ... is amateur at best .
your so called kung fu ... is really ... quite pathetic .
i asked you to demonstrate ... what you know ... and you did ...
not a goddamn thing !
let' s see your tiger crane ... match my eagle' s claw .
like all yankee women ... ... all you can do is order in restaurants and spend a man' s money .
excruciating ... isn' t it ?
yes !
if it was my wish ... ... i could chop your arm off .
no , please don' t !
it' s my arm now .
i can do what i please .
if you can stop me ...
i suggest you try .
i can' t .
because you' re helpless ?
yes .
have you ever felt this before ?
no .
compared to me ... you' re as helpless as a worm fighting an eagle ?
yes !
that' s the beglnnlng !
is it your wish to possess this kind of power ?
yes !
your training will begin ... tomorrow .
since your arm now belongs to me ... ... i want it strong .
can you do that ?
i can , but not that close .
then you can' t do it .
what if your enemy ... is three inches in front of you ... ... what do you do then ... ... curl into a ball ... ... or do you put your flst through him ?
now begin .
it' s the wood that should fear your hand ...
not the other way around .
no wonder you can' t do it ... you acquiesce to defeat ...
before you even begin .
if you want to eat like a dog ...
you can live and sleep outside like a dog .
if you want to live and sleep like a human ... ... pick up those sticks .
come on , you bitch .
ok , pai mei .
here i come .
may i have a glass of water , please ?
