i thought you might ring , mr. nyman .
here are some painkillers to ease you along .
should i close the window ?
no , i' d like some fresh air .
but i do need to go to the toilet .
that' s good .
the doctor would like you to be up and about as much as possible .
oh ...
do those work better than your regular creams ?
i hope so ...
are you playing this to bug your poor old dad ?
no ...
it' s good music ... too .
when you were little , you were proud that your dad was a policeman .
you bragged about it ...
i grew up .
and the police force has changed too .
you working tomorrow ?
yes .
with kollberg ?
no such luck .
it' s rnn , so i' m less than thrilled .
sit down ...
so you went at him with a knife ...
to mark the guy .
he sold bad dope , bad dope that killed my buddies .
17 of my friends are dead , get it ?
don' t you get it , cop ?
let' s cut the crap ...
seventeen people .
i don' t give a damn .
i' ve been on duty since 8 am yesterday .
i' ve spent the whole time looking for you .
there' s only one thing left .
what' s that ?
i know there were two of you .
who the hell told you there were two of us ?
i don' t give a damn what you say ...
thanks .
let' s go .
goodnight ...
bye .
homicide , johansson speaking ...
hang on , rnn .
i think this is right up your alley .
we' il check it out .
goodbye .
there' s been a murder over at sabbatsberg hospital .
some unis will join you over by the main entrance .
where the hell are my ... ?
what' s your name ?
andersson .
when did you get here ?
2 : 26 am .
nine minutes ago .
we were in the vicinity of odenplan .
he' s a rookie , it' s his first murder .
know who the victim is ?
yeah , it' s lieutenant nyman .
but you can' t really tell .
sorry , but i can' t do that right now .
i' m busy .
bye .
beck .
rnn here .
i' m at sabbatsberg .
get over here .
there' s a unit at the main entrance .
i' m sorry ...
it happens to the best of us .
ls it always like this ?
i' ve been a cop for 20 years .
and i' ve never seen anything like this before .
looks like it was a quick strike .
see why i called you ?
not because ...
not because of what ?
not because nyman was a lieutenant , but because of the circumstances .
the man was slaughtered , his killer must be a maniac .
sure looks like it .
rnn ...
looks like it would fit a mauser carbine .
think they can lift some prints ?
the hilt is grooved .
i' ve got to contact nyman' s family .
figure we can wake his wife up at this hour ?
can' t see you have a choice ...
will you come with me ?
parked in a non parking zone halfway up the curb ...
he' s lucky we' re not traffic cops .
hey ...
lsn' t that him , the little guy ?
right , that must be nyman' s boy .
i' il just go get my mother .
my name is beck , i called you earlier .
i' m einar rnn .
please have a seat ...
well , then ...
mrs nyman , if you happen to have any sedatives on hand ,
i advise you to take some .
dad has ...
there' s a bottle of sedatives in the bathroom , should i go get it ?
now would you please tell me why you' re here ?
stig' s dead and ...
and none of us can change that .
why wasn' t i allowed to see him ?
you sounded very odd over the phone .
your husband' s death wasn' t caused by his illness .
someone stole into his room and killed him .
i don' t understand ...
who did it ?
we don' t know .
he was found dead .
someone came in through the window and killed him .
with a bayonet .
he was caught unawares .
it appears to be a surprise attack .
but why ?
we really don' t know .
we hoped you could help us out , mrs nyman .
can you think of anyone at all ?
have there been any threats ?
no ...
did anyone hate your husband ?
who ...
who would hate him ?
your husband was a police officer .
making enemies goes with the territory .
this doesn' t make sense ...
could i come in ?
no .
how about a comment ?
later ...
stay put ...
hi , how' s it going ?
we' ve talked to the patients .
but no one' s heard or seen a thing .
these old buildings have thick walls , you know .
did you know nyman ?
not personally ...
but talk to the guys at the klara precinct .
that' s where he was stationed when he fell ill .
hello , is sahlin in ?
nasty business , i just heard it on the radio .
nothing in the papers yet ?
not yet .
hello , did you just leave the crime scene ?
nasty business ...
lnge ?
yes .
you knew nyman , right ?
wake up .
what the hell are you doing ?
well ...
he kind of ...
it' s hard to say ...
you must have talked now and then .
you couldn' t get close to the guy .
try .
the younger men were afraid of him .
pelle ?
for christ' s sake , i just drifted off ...
this way .
fucking pig !
i' m innocent .
what time is it ?
what time is it ?
what ?
what time is it ?
4 : 55 .
i' ve been here since 10 : 30 , they won' t let me go .
i was in a demonstration .
they can' t detain me for more than six hours .
where' s the report on this guy ?
sign for your effects .
i' m not signing anything .
you didn' t give me a receipt , so i' m not signing anything .
it' s customary ...
okay , i' il sign it myself .
this is an open and shut case .
i' ve spent six hours here without being charged ...
had he received any threats ?
nyman was tight lipped .
you could at least talk to me .
he wouldn' t have told us .
you don' t like my politics .
i have no illusions about the police .
but i thought we would be able to communicate .
did you take the paper ?
where is it ?
sorry ...
i put it over there , on the table .
upset ?
everybody' s being evasive .
mommy ?
oh , no ...
mommy .
what have you done ?
let mommy sleep , we' il go clean you up .
here we go ...
ball !
johan ...
hi there , johan .
where' d it go ?
his diaper leaked , there' s crap all over the duvet .
am i running late ?
no , come lie down a little ...
looky ...
you look exhausted .
i am .
what' s up ?
homicide division lieutenant beck
what' s happened ?
here' s rnn' s report .
saturday , march 27th ...
so what do you think ?
that rnn writes godawful reports .
it sounds pretty grisly .
what did it look like ?
worse than you could possibly imagine .
we' d better catch this guy , and be damn quick about it too .
right .
what do we have ?
not much .
footprints .
maybe some prints .
no one has seen or heard a thing .
this could take time ...
negative on the prints so far .
forget about prints ...
i made a cast , though .
of a boot or shoe with thick soles .
right now we need to catch the perpetrator .
we need to figure out the motive .
revenge ?
right , and if it' s revenge ...
there might be more killings .
what' s your analysis so far ?
have you ...
have you asked ... ?
have you asked yourselves who nyman was ?
who he was ?
that' s right .
who was he ?
or rather , what was he ?
a police officer .
not a very conclusive answer .
what was he ?
come on , martin !
a police lieutenant .
i have to go make a phone call .
what was he ?
i didn' t really know the man .
don' t be evasive , describe the man .
he was a bad cop .
no , he was a fucking lousy cop .
we' ve got a new suspect in the ljunggren case .
come have a look .
he was a blot on the force .
i' m ashamed to have worked at the same precinct , and at the same time , too .
but his reputation was never tarnished .
you know why ?
everyone knows it' s pointless to confront the police .
you can' t win against a regular officer , let alone a lieutenant .
you' re exaggerating .
not really .
it' s second nature for cops to stick together .
we' re bogged down by team spirit .
a unified front is important .
what' s that got to do with it ?
everything .
who do you think did it ?
who eliminated nyman ?
someone he had given a hard time .
someone who wanted to get even .
you mean it' s a person from nyman' s past ?
only his name has probably been filed in one of our wastebaskets ...
all in the name of team spirit ...
want to grab a cup of coffee ?
i' il stick to tea instead .
did you know nyman ?
yes , indeed .
did you serve under him ?
when was that ?
" the vile man from sffle " .
the vile man from sffle " , that' s what we called him .
ln the army .
nyman taught me a lot .
like what , for instance ?
like how to slice a pig' s cock off without it squealing .
how to gouge its eyes out , cut off its limbs , skin it , and slit its belly without it screaming .
want to know how its done ?
you start out by cutting its tongue out .
yes , indeed ...
i learned a great deal from stig nyman .
like what to do when you' re shut in a closet with a wild cat .
you weren' t supposed to kill the cat , they were " recycled " .
know what you do ?
no ...
you pin it to the wall with a knife , through the skin .
you were a paratrooper , right ?
stig nyman was my instructor .
even if this cat business might have been justified in some way , it wasn' t something you ought to take pride in doing .
but nyman did .
you bet !
and he continued in this vein ?
no , that' s going too far .
but i do know that he' s abused both his subordinates and our clients .
i' ve heard a few things over the years .
then wouldn' t he have been reported several times ?
you know where those complaints are filed , in the wastebasket .
what about a higher authority ?
aren' t you naive ...
a guy like nyman always had officers that got his back .
they' d swear that he hadn' t done anything wrong .
no outside forces can get to a police lieutenant .
that' s bullshit .
the government wouldn' t throw out reports like that .
they' d still be on record .
now that was a bright idea .
i just remembered hult , nyman' s henchman .
lf he' s still on the force he must be a sergeant by now .
you should talk to the guy .
you left , what do we do now ?
we' ve got loads to do .
like check the archives of the parliamentary ombudsman .
mrs hall is in charge on saturdays .
you' il have to deal with that .
i need some facts .
ls that all right with you ?
sure ...
he' s afraid of that old bat .
why did they call him that ?
the vile man from sffle " .
well , he came from sffle and he was vile .
one of the vilest people i' ve ever met .
we' re the next shift .
you two guard the door and the rest of us will go inside .
hello .
hello .
come on in .
thanks .
i don' t think i' ve ever owned an ashtray .
when you' re not a smoker , well ...
lsn' t this your day off ?
i usually wear my uniform .
so , why are you here ?
stig nyman' s dead .
i see ...
you knew that already ?
no , but it was in the cards .
his body let him down .
did you know stig ?
not very well .
about as well as i know you .
not very well at all .
you and i have only met a few times .
you knew nyman well , though .
we worked together for years .
what do you think of him ?
he was a very good man .
there were many complaints about nyman .
that' s news to me .
i know you knew about them .
a pack of lies .
some say you' re a bad cop too .
maybe they do .
my record is squeaky clean .
and anyone who tries to smear stig nyman in my presence ...
well , then i' d ...
i' d shut that person up .
i have my ways of doing it .
i know everything about this job .
stig nyman taught you the ropes ?
sure , he taught me a lot .
like how to commit perjury ?
how to copy each other' s reports , even if every single word is a lie .
how to beat up the prisoners .
where to go to work someone over before bringing him in .
ls that what he taught you ?
i' ve never heard of those things .
so you never used a saber to disperse a strike ?
when nyman was in command ?
never knocked down schoolchildren ?
it never happened .
nyman was supposedly an expert at maintaining order .
he was the best .
that' s right .
ln a proposal regarding police conduct during demonstrations , he suggested that the motorcycle division should ram the crowds .
i know nothing about that .
the method was deemed too risky .
the officers might get hurt .
right , i have something else to tell you .
i have something to say , too .
it' s been lonely here since maja died .
so i look out the window a lot .
not that there' s much to see ...
i do a lot of thinking .
know what i think about ?
i think about my 30 years on the force .
i think about the times people have puked all over me .
how many times they' ve spit at me or cried .
or called me a pig or a murderer .
i think of all the hanging victims i' ve cut down .
i' ve had to handle decomposing bodies .
maggots would fall out of my cuffs when i sat down to dinner .
i' ve changed diapers when the kids ' moms were dead drunk .
i' ve worked like a dog all my life to preserve law and order .
so decent people can lead peaceful lives .
but things have gone downhill .
more violence , more bloodshed ...
more and more people criticize the force .
but thanks to your fellow officers , you hang in there .
lf there had been more people like stig nyman around , society would look different .
so anyone wanting to whine about the force will have to go elsewhere .
now it' s my turn .
stig nyman' s illness wasn' t what killed him , someone sneaked into his room and murdered him .
we suspect that the killer was bent on revenge and plans to strike again .
i came here to ask you a specific question .
who hated nyman that badly ?
no one ...
i' ve got to go .
go to work .
<i>j .
johansson claims to have been beaten by stig nyman in jail . </ i>
<i>however , no legal action appears to be called for . </ i>
this is all we have for lieutenant nyman during that period .
will that be all , or should we go further back in time ?
no , this will be fine .
hi , beck here .
has rnn come back to the office yet ?
oh , he hasn' t ...
well , i' il go home and rest a while .
goodbye .
nasty business , that officer getting killed .
i just heard it on the radio .
could we talk about something else ?
you look perky .
i went to the baths .
what' s up ?
20 complaints during the past few years .
i bet i' d still be there if i went back even further .
the baths ?
a sauna ?
and maybe even a massage ?
i won' t lie to you , i had a massage .
massage , huh ...
you left ...
you look a little perkier yourself .
i guess both you and i could use some sleep , but i figured we might get a breakthrough if we keep at it .
it' s worth a try , isn' t it ?
right ...
why don' t we check out ten names each ?
and go home after that .
official crime scene
oh , when did he die ?
ln 1972 ?
oh ...
thank you very much .
mrs nyman , is it correct that only you , your son , and your husband' s two brothers knew which room he was in ?
<i>that' s correct .
my husband didn' t want people to know he was ill . </ i>
<i>oh , another off ? icer knew about it as well , i have his name here . </ i>
<i>palmon harald hult . </ i>
<i> why is that ?
mr hult called last night . </ i>
<i>he was distressed to hear that stig was ill . </ i>
<i> and you gave him the address .
he wanted to send flowers . </ i>
thank you .
i' ve checked my list .
two are dead , and i can' t locate the guy named eriksson .
right ...
<i> ls hult in ?
no , he isn' t . </ i>
<i> anyone seen him today ?
no . </ i>
are you sure ?
could you please ask around ?
<i> ask who ?
you can' t be that understaffed ! </ i>
<i> ls there only one officer on duty ?
no , hang on ... </ i>
<i> anybody seen hult around ?
who' s asking ? </ i>
<i>that hot shot over at homicide , beck . </ i>
<i> hult went somewhere an hour ago .
he went somewhere an hour ago . </ i>
<i> where' d he go ?
no one knows . </ i>
hult called nyman' s wife last night .
she told him which hospital it was .
really ?
i wonder why he called ?
maybe he wanted to send flowers .
not many people knew that nyman had been admitted to the hospital .
that must be why hult called .
it' s an odd coincidence .
when i went to see hult , why didn' t he mention that he' d been in touch with mrs nyman ?
why would he call at night ?
at this time of the year , any time after 5 : 30 pm is night .
like i was saying , i couldn' t get hold of eriksson .
ke eriksson .
the police officer who always complained about everything .
<i> the nyman residence .
sorry to bother you , it' s me again . </ i>
<i>that' s all right , lieutenant beck . </ i>
you mentioned that sergeant hult called last night .
<i> may i ask what time that was ?
fairly late . </ i>
<i> could you narrow that down please ?
we were watching tv ... </ i>
<i>according to stefan , " baretta" had just started .
the tvshow ... </ i>
you told hult which ward and room your husband was in .
<i>hult is dependable , why do you ask ? </ i>
it' s merely a routine question .
thank you very much .
did you watch tv last night ?
that' s right , you were on duty ...
could you find out what time " baretta " was broadcast ?
9 : 25 pm .
that means hult called around 9 : 30 .
kind of late , it wasn' t a duty call .
maybe it was .
he didn' t say much .
but he did find out where nyman was .
he wanted to send flowers .
do you think hult stabbed nyman ?
i would like to discuss that call with him , though .
call him over the radio .
call sergeant hult on the radio .
tell him to contact homicide immediately .
there' s something i' d like to say .
let' s say i called your house and asked your wife about you .
i would never introduce myself as einar valentino rnn .
as what ?
that' s my name .
valentino , like the movie star .
it was mother' s idea ...
what do mean ?
that it' s strange that hult calls nyman' s wife and introduces himself as " palmon harold hult " .
how do you know his name ?
you wrote it down on your pad .
ln addition to that ...
what ?
it' s also listed in the complaint ke eriksson lodged .
good , einar .
great ...
i guess we' il have to take a closer look at eriksson .
i don' t remember the details .
melander would .
he remembers everything .
i' il give him a call .
funny , how both you and i are trying to get hold of a cop .
it might turn out to be the same guy .
<i>the death toll is estimated at 500 . </ i>
<i>ln stockholm , the police have no leads regarding the brutal murder</ i> <i>of police lieutenant stig nyman . </ i>
<i>a press conference will be held later today .
now for sports ... </ i>
i' m sorry to disturb you again .
you called fifteen minutes ago ...
i apologize , i realize this must be painful .
i' m getting used to it .
how can i help you this time ?
it' s about that telephone call .
from sergeant hult ?
did you recognize his voice ?
no , i don' t know the man .
that' s why i wrote down the name .
so it could have been someone else ?
wouldn' t it be simpler if you talked to sergeant hult ?
policemen make enemies .
yes , you told me that .
the second time we talked .
are you aware of the fact that we' ve talked five times during the past 12 hours ?
i' m sorry , maybe i' d better get to the point .
some people felt your husband abused his position .
are you joking ?
no .
he had been reported many times .
what were the charges ?
brutality .
was that it ?
i' m rather busy ...
no , that' s it .
thank you .
goodbye .
christ ...
he was a mean bastard .
for once , i agree with you .
that bayonet interests me .
this guy knew his stuff .
he was handy with a weapon .
so who are we looking for ?
people in the armed forces .
butchers know their stuff .
so do policemen .
that' s going a bit too far , isn' t it ?
are you working on this case ?
what about you ?
it looks like it .
hopefully our paths won' t cross too often .
hopefully ...
could you please go and get him ?
what kind of service did hult do ?
he was a cavalryman .
what about eriksson ?
he was an artilleryman .
are you thinking of the bayonet ?
i figured as much .
what does that mean ?
you can buy them for peanuts .
just go to an army surplus store .
... and his teeth were knocked out .
probably when the perpetrator silenced the victim .
the victim was subjected to lacerations of the abdominal region , and the throat .
was this done in a rational or frenzied manner ?
i' d say it was a combination of rage and cool calculation .
that' s what frightens us .
lasse , could you climb in through the window ?
thanks ...
this might be where stig nyman enters the picture ... ... along with harald hult .
there was an incident at their precinct .
marja eriksson died in the drunk tank on the night of june 26 , 1965 .
on june 26th , marja eriksson and her daughter went to vaxholm to leave her daughter with a friend while she did some work .
ln the afternoon , marja went back downtown .
marja eriksson was a diabetic , and required insulin injections .
this she did regularly , never compromising her health .
but on this particular day , she forgot to bring her syringe .
not long after 7 pm , marja eriksson was found by two of nyman' s officers , sitting on a bench in a dazed state .
her poor swedish might have made things worse .
the officers were convinced that she was either stoned or drunk .
so they took her to the station .
according to their first statement , nyman told them to lock her up .
later , nyman denied ever seeing the woman .
and the boys changed their statements accordingly .
the guard on duty claimed that the junior officers made the decision to lock her up .
they blamed each other .
and it hadn' t been possible to transfer the prisoner .
by the time the guard on night duty checked on her , she was dead .
diabetics usually carry some kind of emergency ld .
that' s right , and marja eriksson had a card in her purse .
only no one searched her .
there were no female officers on hand .
she would have been searched if she' d been transported to krim .
that is , if she had lived to reach our department .
go on ...
nyman made a statement .
claiming never to have set eyes on the woman or her purse .
and the two beat cops took the blame .
all they got was a warning .
what happened to ke eriksson ?
well , i' m not a psychiatrist ...
but his personality changed .
he turned into a cranky , pedantic , by the book cop .
his friends started to avoid him .
he started sending in those complaints .
he reported nyman and hult to the parliamentary ombudsman .
a year after his wife' s death , his lieutenant had him transferred .
but his co workers avoided him and he was reprimanded .
what for ?
violence ?
no , quite the opposite .
no , he was too pedantic .
it took hours to perform the simplest tasks .
einar , maybe we should have some coffee and wake up .
it' s certainly worth a lot .
but it' s still cold .
we don' t stay there during the winter .
what godawful coffee !
well , i' m no psychiatrist , but ...
it seems like he blames the entire force for his wife' s death .
do you really think eriksson did this ?
why do it now ?
after ten years his lust for revenge must have cooled off .
you' re on the wrong track , but good luck to you !
listen , do you think eriksson' s folks are still alive ?
the area' s called segeltorp .
gamla sdertljevgen 36 .
carsick again ?
yeah ...
i' il have to start taking my bike instead .
when ke left around 11 pm last night , was he his ususal self ?
why do you ask ?
it' s just a routine question .
he was ... his usual self .
he doesn' t talk much nowadays .
he was concerned about his rent .
and about that business with malin .
they took the girl away from him .
and he might lose his apartment .
he thinks he' il be evicted soon .
who took his daughter away ?
i presume that malin is his daughter .
that' s right , malin' s his daughter .
i thought you knew that the child protection services had taken malin .
why ?
why did the police murder his wife ?
answer my question , please .
children aren' t taken from their parents .
not without careful consideration .
careful , well that' s a laugh .
the neighbors reported him to the child protection services .
what for ?
that ke left malin alone at night .
that he didn' t feed her enough ...
they came here , too .
to snoop .
they said that ke' s ... ... depressive ...
well , that he was in low spirits .
they said it had " an adverse effect on the girl' s psyche " .
that' s exactly how they put it .
they had talked to his employer too .
they contacted all the supervisors he' d ever had .
lncluding the police force ?
of course ...
his opinion carried a lot of weight , it seems .
do you know who they talked to ?
yes ...
it was that lieutenant nyman .
the same man that let ke' s wife die .
may i have a look ?
thank you .
larsson ...
do you have to do that ?
back in those days , your son was a top marksman on the force .
that' s right .
ke won many fine prizes .
they' re not here , he has them .
can you picture what went through his mind afterwards ?
you' re sure it' s a man ?
women don' t use bayonets much .
and not many wear size 11 shoes .
can you picture his mindset ?
no , i can' t .
how the hell could l ?
well , he primarily uses a mauser rifle .
and he has a handgun .
what kind of a handgun ?
he won a gold medal .
what make was it ?
a hammerli lnternational .
and he also has ...
what else does he have ?
i don' t know , but with regard to the mauser and the hammerli , he' s got a license , you know .
don' t worry , we don' t think there' s anything wrong with his permits .
well , i presume he has a license for this one as well ...
after all , he' s used it in competitions .
an american automatic rifle .
a johnson .
what the hell is going on ?
what are you doing , hult ?
cordoning off the area properly .
that' s a bloody waste of resources .
post a guard outside the door .
hi , could i hitch a ride to the liquor store ?
<i>sergeant hult , call in . </ i>
<i>you are requested to report to lieutenant beck . </ i>
well , aren' t you going to call in ?
ln due time .
i' m on voluntary duty .
you didn' t see him , did you ?
it was a godawful sight .
what' s that , let' s go take a look .
the car ?
no ...
forget about it ...
i won' t make it before they close .
this is crazy ...
i' m out of here .
what the hell ... ?
what happened to andersson ?
let go of me !
you' il get killed !
help !
help !
you in the coat , watch out !
help !
help !
let' s beat it !
look !
watch out !
why are you in the fountain ?
go away !
it' s dangerous here .
but what are you doing ?
beat it !
beat it , or you' il get a whipping !
listen up !
leave the area , you are in danger !
take cover !
get inside the buildings !
this is gunvald larsson ...
i' m at dalagatan 34 .
there' s a madman armed with an automatic rifle on the roof .
two policemen are down , in front of the eastman lnstitute .
full alert in the downtown area .
seal off dalagatan and vstmannagatan , from bantorget to karlbergsvgen .
and odengatan down to st. eriksplan as well ..
and all the side streets in the vicinity .
don' t send any squad cars or officers in uniform to the location .
assembly at odenplan .
good .
what ?
we' re inside the eastman lnstitute .
i' il try to get a crack at him soon .
bye .
fucking hell ...
am i in lndia ?
what kind of gun are you packing ?
or are you a fucking pacifist ?
know what , kollberg ?
i' ve always considered you a loser .
so , how are we going to get out on the street ?
walking out would be suicide ...
and the rear windows would take too long .
do you know those two guys ?
no .
why were they here ?
a parking violation .
the question is why they were shot .
or why the hell someone' s shooting at us .
that bastard didn' t shoot the kids .
but he obviously recognized us .
he couldn' t have recognized those guys in the fountain though .
they' re in uniform .
someone doesn' t like cops ...
did you see if the sniper' s on the roof or in an apartment ?
look !
we' re in luck .
what the hell do you mean ?
i' m going to risk it .
have another cookie .
thank you , i' m fine .
do you mind if we look at his room ?
no , that' s ...
it' s probably a mess , though ...
those guys that ran inside have put on white coats ...
the sniper' s on the roof .
at least for now .
he wasn' t there the last time .
let' s check it out .
this way ...
this is ke' s room .
of course , it looked neater when he was still living at home .
he took his furniture with him ...
what do you think of these spots ?
martin ...
look .
your son lives on dalagatan ?
yes , number 34 , only ...
please go downstairs , we' il be right with you .
call strmgren , or whoever' s on duty .
have him contact kollberg and get him to call us here .
do you have the equipment to secure the room ?
make the call first ...
where are you going ?
to clean up .
it' s filthy .
i have to clean up ...
please remain downstairs .
go back downstairs !
what a nasty tone of voice ...
carrying on like that ...
i couldn' t stop her .
i only meant to be helpful .
there , there ...
martin , there' s ...
all i see are a bunch of pipes ...
how about the other door ?
shit !
what' s going on ?
wait inside and stay calm .
what do we do now ?
go and brief the others .
i want to get that bastard !
we can' t reach him .
so what the hell are we waiting for ?
squad cars ...
target practice .
did you get the names of the tenants up there ?
we need outside access .
maybe ...
let' s go !
okay , let' s roll .
clapper ...
do we know the sniper' s identity ?
unfortunately , no .
all we know is that this madman is out for policemen .
two officers are down already .
we don' t know why he targets cops .
now what ?
the subway !
ls there a plan ?
we' re in the process ...
you look terrible , larsson .
where is beck ?
we need to use specialists here .
enforcement specialists .
describe the crime scene .
a madman' s picking off cops with an automatic rifle .
the surrounding buildings aren' t as high , it' il be hard to get him .
we have the resources .
i have a suggestion .
let' s move inside the sealed off area .
the old gasworks .
the site of the old reservoir ?
can helicopters land there ?
ls it out of range ?
unless the bastard' s got a mortar .
all right , gentlemen .
we' il move on to the roof of the old gasworks .
assembly in ten minutes .
do you plan to storm the roof ?
first we want to talk to the man .
i' il use a bullhorn and urge him to give up .
lf he doesn' t , we' il have to strike .
<i>may i have your attention , this is the police . </ i>
<i>ln order to make way for emergency vehicles, </ i> <i>we advise you to vacate odenplan . </ i>
<i>please leave the area and head in the direction of karlbergsvgen . </ i>
hult !
i' ve been trying to contact you .
really .
ke eriksson used your name when he called mrs nyman last night .
ke eriksson ?
ke reinhold eriksson ?
that' s right .
ls he nyman' s killer ?
looks like it .
and he' s the sniper on the roof ?
probably .
he only shoots policemen , according to the report we just received .
we haven' t opened fire on him yet ?
we' re closing in .
we have established radio contact with our officers .
tear gas specialists and marksmen have been stationed strategically .
there are only two good spots .
the bonnier building ...
watch it ! ... and the church of gustav vasa .
think the vicar will like that ?
first , we give him a chance to surrender .
otherwise , he' il be captured or shot .
we cannot lose any more officers .
there are ladder trucks on hand ...
we' re ready to go .
thank you .
i' il be right with you .
as i was saying , ladder trucks can be deployed if necessary .
the fire dept . will be operating the ladders .
they will be accompanied by policemen in fire dept . uniforms .
i have some vital information .
lf our sniper is ke eriksson , he could be armed with a johnson automatic rifle and a swedish army repeater .
both rifles have scopes .
he appears to have a scope .
christ , a johnson ...
it only weighs seven kilos and has the punch of a machine gun .
450 rounds a minute .
and the mauser can pick off a flea 600 meters away .
a little luck and a good scope , and he can ice a guy 1 , 000 meters away .
he can do a lot of damage .
remember , the sniper must be given the opportunity to surrender .
let' s go .
kiss my ass ...
we should strike from the inside .
skip the guts and glory talk .
this is a team of professionals , we don' t need any more amateurs .
yes , indeed .
heil hiltler !
rest assured i won' t forget that .
even by to your standards , gunvald , that was a bad move .
larsson !
for god' s sake , behave yourself !
drive up to the spot we call " claws " , we' re safe there .
then we' il have to pass a short stretch where we' il be in range .
you' il have to floor it .
shouldn' t i use the siren ?
he hasn' t shot any ambulances yet .
let' s hope he' il keep that up ...
do you think he' s got his daughter up there ?
she' s been taken into care .
she' s not in danger .
her dad would never hurt her .
<i>attention please .
this is commissioner malm . </ i>
<i>l don' t know you , eriksson , and you don' t know me . </ i>
<i>but i assure you that the game is up . </ i>
<i>you have ten minutes to surrender in an honorable fashion . </ i>
and if he did surrender , how could you tell without this ?
74 ... 747 , this is the commissioner , over .
<i>747 here , commencing operation lce hunt . </ i>
would you like a cookie ?
yes , please .
sugar ?
no , a cookie is fine .
642 , this is the commissioner .
countdown initiated .
<i>ten , nine ... </ i> <i> ... eight , seven ... </ i> <i> ... six , five ... </ i> <i> ... four , three ... </ i> <i> ... two ... one . </ i>
<i>zero . </ i>
progress to level three .
roger .
time for level three .
was the coffee strong enough ?
i haven' t had any yet .
things are heating up , you see .
i thought it very tasty .
it looks like they' re going to try something else : an airborne strike .
they' re sending in helicopters .
the police have failed to bring about his surrender , so now they are flying in , a fairly risky operation .
take cover !
the tank is going to blow up !
he shot down the helicopter .
ls that your conclusion ?
where' s martin ?
we' il have to call in the army .
what the hell ... ?
we' il have to call in the armed forces .
what can they do ?
drop a bomb .
bring in the heavy artillery , or ...
or what ?
or deploy paratroopers .
we could even drop a dozen police dogs .
shut up , gunvald .
the fire dept . , i haven' t ...
i haven' t used the fire dept .
it might work .
they didn' t kill eriksson' s wife .
what happens if he sees that cops are dressed in firemen' s uniforms ?
what does eriksson' s wife have to do with this ?
a great deal ...
three people are dead and seven are wounded .
and there are loads of people within range .
what if he gets tired of policemen and starts shooting civilians ?
this is a one man mission .
i' m the man .
i cannot allow it .
i' m sorry , but it' s my decision .
what kind of reasoning is that , logic or moral ?
<i> everything going smoothly ?
yes . </ i>
<i> calling rnn .
rnn here , over . </ i>
<i> see anything ?
no . </ i>
what happened ?
rnn ?
a fuse blew in the fire truck .
i know .
how' s martin ?
rnn ?
rnn here .
what happened ?
we don' t know !
beck must have bought it ...
wait !
our man in the church tower thinks he can see beck .
he' s lying on a grate on a landing .
he appears to be alive .
we' ve got to go get him .
and finish this mess .
go get your buddy , kollberg .
and i' il get the son of a bitch .
what do you think of my odds ?
they' re pretty slim .
i need a rope , could you help me out ?
we' il blow the doors and storm the roof .
i need assistance , one or possibly two men .
listen carefully .
i don' t want any heroics .
you risk getting shot .
take me .
you ?
right , i can see that you might want to , hult .
i' il go .
who the hell are you ?
my name' s bohlin .
are you an policeman ?
no , a construction worker .
i live next door .
give the man a gun .
could i use my own gun ?
it' il only take a minute to get it .
be careful turning the corner .
that' s illegal .
and wrong .
it' s damn wrong .
i' m ready .
i' il take this staircase .
as soon as the fuse is in place , run two flights down .
and anyone who kills the sniper will be held accountable .
even if it' s in self defense ?
yes .
let' s synchronize our watches .
why didn' t you shoot ?
i don' t understand .
how could you ?
got a license for that gun ?
then expect trouble .
let' s get him off the roof .
