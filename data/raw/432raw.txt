you' re looking good , dutch .
it' s been a long time , general .
come on inside .
eighteen hours ago , we lost a chopper ... carrying a cabinet minister and his aide ... from this charming little country .
we' ve got a transponder fix on their position about here .
this cabinet minister ... does he always travel on the wrong side of the border ?
apparently they strayed off course ... and we' re fairly certain they' re in guerrilla hands .
why don' t you use the regular army ?
what do you need us for ?
' cause some damned fool accused you of being the best .
dillon !
you son of a bitch !
what' s the matter ?
the cla got you pushing too many pencils ?
huh ?
had enough ?
make it easy on yourself , dutch .
ok !
ok , ok .
you never knew when to quit .
damn good to see you .
what' s this fucking tie business ?
come on .
forget about my tie .
i heard about that job you pulled in berlin .
very nice , dutch .
good old days .
the good old days .
why' d you pass on libya ?
that wasn' t my style .
you got no style .
you know that .
come on .
why did you pass ?
we' re a rescue team ... not assassins .
now , what do we got to do ?
the cabinet minister' s important to our scope of operations ... in this part of the world .
our friends are about to get squeezed .
we can' t let that happen .
we need the best .
that' s why you' re here .
go on .
simple setup .
one day operation .
we pick up their trail , run ' em down ... grab those hostages , and cross the border ... before anybody knows we were there .
what do you mean , " we " ?
i' m going in with you , dutch .
general , my team always works alone .
you know that .
we all have our orders , major .
once you reach your objective ...
dillon will evaluate the situation and take charge .

claims he has misery , but he has a lot of fun ...
oh , baby ...

delta one zero .
roger , team leader .
rendezvous points and radio freqs ... are indicated and fixed .
awacs contact on four hour intervals .
who' s our backup ?
no such thing , ol ' buddy .
this is a one way ticket .
once we cross that border , we' re on our own .
this is getting better by the minute .
she' s built sweet ...
she got everything that uncle john need ...
oh , baby ...

yeah , baby ...

me and dutch both got one .
well , long tall sally , she' s built sweet ...
she got everything that uncle john need ...
oh , baby ...

gonna have some fun tonight .
whoo ...
have some fun tonight ...
ok , bird two , prepare to cover me .
you got it , leader .
never knew how much i missed this , dutch .
you never were that smart .
hawkins , you' re up .
lines away .
the pilots have each got one round in the head .
whoever hit it , stripped the shit out of it .
took him out with a heat seeker .
something else , major .
this is no ordinary army taxi .
it looks more like a surveillance bird to me .
pick up the trail yet ?
billy' s on it .
heat seeker , dillon .
that' s pretty sophisticated for half assed mountain boys .
i guess they' re getting better equipped every day .
there were 12 guerrillas .
they took the two men from the helicopter ... but there' s something else .
what ?
six men wearing us issued army boots .
they came in from the north ... and then they followed the guerrillas .
mean anything to you ?
probably just another rebel patrol .
they operate in here all the time .
see what you can find .
yes , sir .
what' s he got ?
same business .
guerrillas hauling two guys in the chopper ... followed by men with american equipment .
do you remember afghanistan ?
trying to forget it .
come on .
let' s go .
oh !
god !
holy mother of god .
jim hopper .
mac , cut them down .
i knew these men .
green berets out of fort bragg .
what the hell were they doing here ?
i don' t know , dutch .
this is inhuman .
nobody told me there was an operation in this area .
they shouldn' t have been here .
well , somebody sent them .
the guerrillas skinned them ?
why did they skin them ?
ain' t no way for no soldier to die .
what happened here , billy ?
strange , major .
there was a fire fight .
they were shooting in all directions .
can' t believe jim hopper walked into an ambush .
i don' t believe he did .
i can' t find a single track .
just doesn' t make sense .
what about the rest of hopper' s men ?
there' s no sign , sir .
they never left here .
hell , it' s like they just disappeared .
stick with the guerrilla trail .
let' s get the hostages .
we move , five meter spread .
no sound .
it' s time to let old painless out of the bag .
payback time .
you' re ghostin ' us , mother fucker .
i don' t care who you are back in the world .
you give our position one more time ...
i' il bleed you real quiet and leave you here .
got that ?
aah !
fuck you .
aah !
he killed one of the hostages .
we move .
mac , blain ... the nest .
billy , poncho ... the guard .
hawkins , dillon ... backup .
once they' re set , i hit the fuel dump .
one down .
what the hell' s he doing ?
what the fuck ?
aaaah !
show time , kid .
target' s the center , on the upper level !
dutch , on your nine !
get that mother !
go .
hyah !
stick around .
hostages are inside !
knock knock .
i got ' em !
hawkins , call in position and situation .
get connor for the hook !
you got it , major .
shit .
mac , any sign of the other hostage ?
found the other guy .
he' s dead , too ... and the kid from the chopper .
but if they' re central american , i' m a goddamn chinaman .
from the looks of it , our cabinet minister was cla .
another thing , major .
we were lucky .
other guys we waxed ...
russian military advisers .
something pretty big was gonna happen here .
good work , mac .
clear the area .
no traces .
get the men ready to move .
right .
son of a bitch is dug in like an alabama tick .
you' re hit .
you' re bleeding , man .
i ain' t got time to bleed .
oh ... ok .
you got time to duck ?
this is goddamn beautiful .
goddamn jackpot .
this is more than we ever thought we' d get .
now we got those bastards .
we got ' em .
i think this is what you' re looking for .
you set us up !
it' s all bullshit !
all of it .
the cabinet minister , the whole business .
got us in here to do your dirty work .
we just stopped a major invasion .
in three days , they' d have crossed the border .
why us ?
nobody else could' ve done it .
pissed about the cover story ?
i needed it to get you in here .
what story did you hand hopper ?
look , we' ve been looking for this place for months .
my men were in that chopper when it got hit !
hopper was supposed to get them .
he disappeared .
he didn' t disappear .
he was skinned alive !
my orders were to get somebody to crack these bastards !
so you cooked up a story and dropped us in a meat grinder .
what happened to you , dillon ?
you used to be somebody i could trust .
i woke up .
why don' t you ?
you' re an asset ... an expendable asset ... and i used you to get the job done .
got it ?
my men are not expendable .
and i don' t do this kind of work .
major !
we stepped into some real shit here .
air surveillance says we got guerillas all over .
can' t be more than one , two miles away .
how much time ?
half hour , maybe less .
tell mac we move in five .
wait .
she goes , too .
she' s got valuable information .
she' il give away our position any chance she gets .
no deal .
you' re still under orders , major .
you wanna make that call or should l ?
she' s your baggage .
you fall behind , and you' re on your own .
place is too hot for a pickup .
they won' t touch us till we get over the border .
hey , billy , give me a way out of this hole .
aerial says we' re cut off .
the only way out is that valley that leads east ... but i wouldn' t wish that on a broke dick dog .
not much choice .
poncho , take lead .
double time it .
dillon !
dillon !
over here .
turn around .
why ?
thanks .
anytime .
billy !
billy !
the other day , i was going down on my girlfriend ... and i said to her ...
jeez , you got a big pussy .
jeez , you got a big pussy .
she said , " why did you say that twice ?
and i said , " i didn' t .
see , it was because of the echo .
it was ....
ha ha ha !
ha ha ha ha !
over here .
over here .
over here .
turn around .
turn around .
ha ha ha ha !
turn around .
turn around .
over here .
ha ha ha ha !
anytime .
anytime .
goddamn .
whew .
buddy , buddy , buddy .
i' ve seen some bad ass bush before , but nothing like this .
i hear you .
this shit' s something .
makes cambodia look like kansas .
que pasa , amigo ?
a little taste off home .
you lose it here ... you' re in a world of hurt .
come on , sweetheart .
stop sandbaggin ' it .
now get up .
come on , get up .
would you get up ?
mierda !
ni lo intentes .
maybe you better put her on a leash , agent man .
try it again ... please .
callate .
what' s got billy so spooked ?
can' t say , major .
been acting squirrelly all morning .
that damn nose of his ... it' s weird .
what is it ?
billy .
what the hell is wrong with you ?
there' s something in those trees .
do you see anything ?
up there ahead .
nothing .
what do you think ?
i guess it' s nothing , major .
please !
please !
aah !
billy , break back .
back right .
what the ...
this isn' t her blood .
what the hell did you do to him ?
major , you better take a look at this .
did you find hawkins ?
i ...
i can' t tell .
what in god' s name ?
i think it' s hawkins .
where the hell is his body ?
there' s no sign of it .
ask her what happened .
que paso , mujer ?
mujer , que paso ?
qu fue lo que viste ?
quien fue ?
yo no se .
dime , mujer !
quien fue ?
dime !
la selva se lo llevo .
no estoy segura .
no se .
she says the jungle ... it just came alive and took him .
bullshit !
that' s not what she said !
what she said doesn' t make any sense .
those sappers followed us ...
hell , they' ve been ahead of us !
this woman' s been running us right to ' em !
hold it !
why didn' t they take his radio or his weapon ?
why didn' t she escape ?
hopper .

they did the same thing to jim hopper .
i want hawkins ' body found .
sweep pattern .
double back .
50 meters .
let' s go .
come on in , you fuckers .

old painless is waiting .
sergeant !

aaaah !

mother fucker !
you mother fucker !
aah !
what happened ?
i saw it .
you saw what ?
i saw it .
blain .
no powder burns , no shrapnel .
the wound' s all fused , cauterized .
what the hell could have done this to a man ?
mac .
mac , look at me !
who did this ?
i don' t know , goddamn it .
i saw s something .
not a thing , not a fucking trace .
no blood , no bodies .
we hit nothing .
dillon ... better get on the radio .
mac .
sergeant !
yes , sir .
i want a defensive position above that ridge ... mined with everything we' ve got .
put him in his poncho .
take him with us .
i got him .
vamonos .
major ...
i set up flares , frags , and claymores .
nothing' s coming near this place without tripping on something .
thank you , sergeant .
mac .
he was a good soldier .
he was , um ... my friend .
good bye , bro .
blazer one , i repeat , extraction necessary .
say again , blazer one .
say again .
request for extraction denied .
area is still compromised .
proceed to sector 3, 000 for prisoner extraction .
priority , out .
next contact 0930 .
roger , blazer one .
1030 hours .
damn bastards .
they say we' re still in too far , and they can' t risk coming in .
we' re assets , dillon .
expendable assets .
it comes with the job .
i can accept it .
bullshit .
you' re just like the rest of us .
shitload of good a chopper' s gonna do us in here anyhow .
sergeant ?
sergeant !
sergeant !
who hit us today ?
i don' t know .
i only saw one of them camouflaged .
he was there .
those eyes disappeared .
what was that ?
those eyes , they ... they disappeared .
i know one thing , major .
i drew down and fired straight at it .
capped off 200 rounds in the minigun ...
full pack .
nothing ... nothing on this earth could have lived .
not at that range .
mac , you take first watch ... then you get some rest , ok ?
ask her what she saw .
ask her what happened to hawkins .
go ahead , ask her .
qu pas hoy ?
qu fue lo que viste ?
te dijo lo que s .
fue la selva que se lo llev .
qu ms quiere que te diga ?
same fucking thing .
the jungle , it came alive and took him .
billy , you know something .
what is it ?
i' m scared , poncho .
bullshit .
you ain' t afraid of no man .
there' s something out there waiting for us ... and it ain' t no man .
we' re all gonna die .
the man' s losing it .
he' s losing his cool .
nothing but a couple guys running around .... and we gotta take ' em .
still don' t understand , dillon , do you ?
whatever it is out there , it killed hopper ... and now it wants us .
here we are again , bro ... just you and me .
same kind of moon , same kind of jungle .
real number ten night , remember ?
whole platoon ... 32 men chopped into meat ... and we walk out , just you and me .
nobody else .
right on top of them .
not a scratch .
not a fucking scratch .
you know , whoever got you ... he' il come back again , and when he does ...
i' m going to cut your name right into him .
i' m going to cut your name into him .
what the hell is it ?
mac !
where are you ?
over here !
mac !
aah !
mac !
fuck !
mac , where are you ?
mac , where are you ?
jesus .
i got you , mother fucker .
i killed you , you fuck .
jesus , you killed a pig .
think you could have found something bigger ?
fuck you , poncho .
fuck you .
where' s the girl ?
aw , shit !
why the hell wasn' t anybody watching her ?
why didn' t she try to get away ?
look at her .
she' s scared out of her mind .
major , you better take a look at this .
blain' s body , it' s gone .
it came in through the tripwires .
took it right out from under our noses .
that boar had to set off a tripflare ... because there ain' t no other tracks .
how could anyone get through this ... and carry out blain without us knowing it ?
why didn' t he try and kill one of us ?
he came to get the body .
he' s killing us one at a time .
like a hunter .
he' s using the trees .
yesterday , what did you see ?
you' re wasting your time .
no more games .
i don' t know what it was .
it ...
go on .
it changed colors like the chameleon .
it uses the jungle .
blain and hawkins were killed by a lizard ?
that' s a bullshit psych job .
there' s 2 or 3 men out there .
fucking lizard !
what' s your name ?
anna .
anna , the thing is hunting us .
all of us .
you know that .
what the hell are you doing ?
we' il need everyone .
i' m taking her back .
we leave in five minutes .
we' re not going yet .
rendezvous is ten miles away .
you think the chopper' s going to wait ?
we make a stand now , or nobody will be left .
there is something else .
when the big man was killed , you must have wounded it .
its blood was on the leaves .
if it bleeds , we can kill it .
look out .
you really think this boy scout bullshit' s gonna work ?
it can see tripwires .
maybe it can' t see this .
instead of complaining , maybe you should help .
what makes you think he' il come through here ?
the trees have tripwires every 50 yards .
this is the only way in .
when i was little , we found a man .
he looked like ... like butchered .
the old women in the village crossed themselves ... and whispered crazy things , such strange things .
ei diablo , cazador de hombres .
only in the hottest years this happens .
and this year , it grows hot .
we begin finding our men .
we found them sometimes without their skin ... and sometimes much , much worse .
ei que hace trofeos de los hombres ... means " the demon who makes trophies of man .
what you gonna try next , cheese ?
hey , dutch .
dutch !
shit !
aah !
i got you , you mother !
i got you !
i' m coming !
mac !
mac !
get ramirez to the chopper .
hold it .
i' m going after mac .
that' s not your style , dillon .
i picked up bad habits from you .
get your people the hell out .
you can' t win this , dillon .
maybe i can get even .
dillon .
just hold onto that damn chopper .
ohh !
ohh !
he' s busted up pretty bad , major .
i can make it .
i can make it .

we' ve both got scores to settle .
