i' m seeing the coroner tomorrow .
that was fucking horrible .
i was told about davey like he was in love with me .
was there anything that sighted odd to you ?
odd ?
about what happened .
no one knows what happened .
it' s a fucking mystery , ain' t it ?
it' s rather technical .
you may not understand some ...
how do i arrange an independent post mortem ?
mister graham , i do understand ...
you are my lawyer .
it was an incontrovertible suicide .
billy , he' s back .
i' ve just seen him .
i' ve just seen will graham .
you' re sure ?
i wasn' t first , but anyone in that bind up club of his .
looks like a fucking puggy .
just calm down frank .
he' s nothing .
nothing to worry about .
who is worried ?
take me to the shop .
and find al .
a long time .
we thought we' d lost you .
fuck me , look at you .
he' s been sleeping in loft .
scuffy bastard .
enough of meat .
fearless fucker , i' d say .
lost the weight , right will ?
i' m leaving but one day .
what can friends say , mate ?
he was a lovely kid .
i still can' t believe it .
not davey , not that .
why ?
i wanna know why .
no pucker knows will .
no one .
that' s a fact .
what was he into ?
he was always into something .
but we did not know in what .
i mean no one was putting a hand on him , is that what you mean .
everyone loved him , will .
tell me .
there' s nothing to tell .
don' t lie to me .
he is dead !
what' s it matter ?
it matters .
of course it fucking matters .
i wanna know why he died and where he died .
i wanna know why he sat in a bath of cold water for 12 hours .
and his clothes .
and then cut his throat .
i want the fucking truth now , talk to me .
he was dealing .
a bit of coke .
nothing new .
everybody sensed a little bit in it .
they' re all doing it .
he' s right .
i mean davey played it .
you know davey , you know what he was like , will .
was he using it ?
he had a smoke once or twice .
that' s the truth , will .
how much was he turned in ?
there was nearly 11 gram in a fly , you don' t get so money dealing with graham .
he was webbed up over beautiful paybill .
he had more money than sent us .
he stiffed them a little .
i didn' t ever clue on ever buying .
they go often on lying a pad at fucking rat shits .
i don' t know it .
he was working .
eddy gave him a lift .
holland park , i don' t drink .
something happened .
i wanna know what .
well , you' re back , will .
but are you back ?
that' il be something .
the fucking wild punch .
we had this fucking money on the safe .
anyone gets in our way .
everything safe but you take them will .
frank turner may have something to say about that ?
he' s a fucking crack tag .
he' s been busy while i have been away .
he was all over in everything .
one day i' m gonna fuck him where he breves .
it' s a lot of soft money up , will .
you could have them over , will .
you put your mind to it .
i' m not back for that .
you think you' ve changed .
do you ?
you haven' t changed .
not really .
people like us don' t change .
not deep down .
arnie , you' re wrong .
you' re wrong about most things , most of the time .
you know all your life you raised this city .
it' s in your blood .
you think living like a fucking animal in a back of a van is gonna change that .
do you ?
cause nothing changes , not really .
you look at frank turner .
he' s still bad to the fucking bone .
and he' s gonna come for you .
he has to .
it' s on you , will !
but you knew that .
you knew that the moment you to stepped back in this city .
you knew that there were gonna be bodies .
someone' s going to die .
but there' s nothing what you want .
isn' t it , will ?
you want to die .
or maybe you should do with your fucking brother dealing get over with .
the man doesn' t drink .
hello .
what are you doing here ?
is there somewhere we can talk ?
please .
his brother' s back .
davey graham' s brother .
will graham .
asking questions .
if he finds out .
what ?
what' s he gonna find out ?
what could he possibly find out ?
he' s killed people .
yeah , he' s scum .
just like his brother .
what happened that night , i mean what did you do to him to make him ... ?
that night i was at home with my family .
i thought i' d never see you again .
why are you here , will ?
you know why .
davey .
no , i mean why are you here ?
here with me now ?
i saw you .
i don' t want to speak .
i' m sorry , i' d like you to leave .
i stop writing because ,
it was unfair .
unfair ?
unfair ?
christ .
you must define a better word than that .
i loved you , will .
not as for being who you were .
i' ve always known who you were .
what you are .
i can' t forgive you .
not for leaving me or abandoning me , i
i' ve come to understand that .
it' s that shame and difficult you have of thinking about you are not loved ?
believing that you are not capable of being loved ?
look at me .
look for what i' ve become .
i sometimes don' t talk to another living soul for fucking days .
weeks .
i' m always on a move , i trust no one , nothing .
and it' s got fuck odd to do with escape .
or withdraw or fear .
it' s grief .
for a life wasted .
and now there' s davey .
another fucking wasted life .
and i' m gonna find out why .
that you loved him almost as much as me .
i thought that you might be able to help .
i thought you' d want to help .
i don' t know how to help you .
at least pathologist report was quite comprehensive .
coroner' s verdict , of course , inevitable .
however ..
i' m not questioning the suicide verdict .
i just need to know why my brother killed himself .
just try to surmise why anyone takes their own life .
sir , i say what you' ve got to say ?
very well .
was your brother homosexual ?
or perhaps bisexual ?
was he bisexual ?
there was damage to the mucus membrane in his anus .
internal bleeding .
he had an intercourse some time before his death .
what are you talking about ?
that wasn' t in there ?
he' s been sitting in a water for at least twelve hours .
it' s difficult ...
i' ve no interest in blaming or criticizing anyone , i just want the complete facts , the truth .
the fact is , there was anal penetration on the night before he died .
he wasn' t bisexual .
i knew a woman , who' d been married for thirty years , her husband was bisexual .
she hadn' t got a slightest ...
i would have known .
very well .
that leads to one other conclusion .
if your brother wasn' t homosexual or bisexual then the act was , to use an illegal term , nonconsensual buggery .
he was raped ?
there was no semen on the mouth .
often in rape cases there is forced genital mouth contact .
there was evidence that he ejaculated .
what the fuck are you saying ?
it' s not uncommon for victims to become aroused during the act .
even ejaculate .
this can cause damaging psychological stress .
if ...
and i do say " if " this happened to your brother , then it might account for the subsequent suicide .
of course none of this would made any fundamental difference of the inquest , the coroner' s verdict would have been the same .
i can put you in touch with someone that can explain it a little better than me .
if you' d like it .
if it would help .
if you think , it might help .
' it' s kathy , i' m at work , you ring me back .
where were you last night ?
you are a sot , davey .
hi , it' s sheridan , we go to the party tonight .
i call from linda , my old school friend .
she needs a jump , and she neds a bounce of work .
don' t be late davey , you' re always late .
still in your favor , it' s mickser .
i fall out .
you should be on the run , you still must be running tonight .
ring me up , you lump .
hello .
hallo , is that sheridan ?
yes .
i' m a friend of davey' s .
can we talk ?
it' s important .
and he left about what time ?
eleven , soon after eleven .
alone ?
yes .
did you see him leave ?
no .
but i know he wasn' t with anyone .
he wasn' t at the party that night , i told you .
yeah .
did you noticed anyone leave a sign to him ?
no , it was early .
this girl you saw too .
well there was one thing .
the guy she was with .
i saw him waiting while davey and stella were doing that deal .
he had a cellphone .
i just missed davey leaving .
front doors , half way to the lift .
this guy was phoning .
and he looked nervous .
and he' s seen davey leaving while he went with stella out of the bedroom .
maybe it' s nothing .
maybe he was just nervous because she was scoring .
did you know who he was ?
no .
do you think you can find out ?
i could ring her .
every victim reacts in a different way .
but there are patterns .
various elements .
there' s belief to try to switch off that didn' t happen .
couldn' t happen to them .
shock .
can and does take all kinds of forms .
some victims say that they feel strangely coming .
one feeling to touch it .
others feel a need to show it .
express sastility , reach .
but sometimes , not often , but in rare cases , i' ve known at least three , where this disgust .
this terrible anger has turned against themselves .
are you all right ?
do you want me to go on ?
can i take a drink ?
help yourself .
all of the myths is that rapist whether they rape man or woman are idly sexed of insatiable sexual appetites .
all the truth is that they are fundamentally inadequate .
they try to prove themselves to themselves that rape becomes a sort of symbol of the virility .
not willing to trust at sex at all .
rape is much more about domination , humiliation , defining .
it' s a kind of power .
more than is to do with any sort of sexual pleasure .
what kind of a man am i looking for ?
what the police will be looking for .
he more likely to be heterosexual even married , with kids , could be any reasonable age and the men may have been more than one .
often it' s just , older victim done .
was the chance that davey would have known him ?
the more likely that the attack came from strangers .
he might have known him ,
i can' t really answer that .
you are going to the police .
please .
please let them deal with it .
never did like you .
i mean , look at you now .
like a fucking pukey .
i' m talking to you .
you , useless bag of shit .
message from mister turner .
you bury that brother of yours and you fuck off back the way you come from .
get me ?
willy ?
and you' il tell those fucking transport as you used to run with .
they get any ideas , they get fucking funny
they are going down all .
she' s unbelievable respurred .
she' s found stella up right , she' s got his name , his address , she' s even got his fucking phone number .
said , she' s drawing up this guest list for the opening of a new club or something .
at least to send out the invitation .
she' s quite annoying , i tell you .
i' m in on of use to think what davey sore to them , but ... son , have eyes that one , no doubt .
will , are you with me ?
davey was raped .
what are you talking about ?
he killed himself because he was raped .
what a fuck are you talking about ?
i had a second post mortem the police pathologist missed .
well , missed ?
what ?
davey was bugged .
the night before he killed himself .
why do you tell me straight away ?
because i knew what you' d be thinking now .
no .
no .
no .
this fact' s itself stupid .
yeah , but you' re not sure , are you ?
don' t you lie down on me .
don' t you fucking lie down on me !
davey was ...
it was not bang .
fuck you !
fuck you !
what do you say ?
nothing .
nothing ?
ask irish .
it' s a fact mr. turner .
he ain' t gonna give no one no trouble .
don' t ever underestimate will graham .
he' s a fierce man .
we' il go the distance .
you should never have left him like that .
you was wrong , will and you know it .
you never had no family , no one .
he was just a kid .
he was always buying them stuff , he was giving them things .
he knew that he had nothing .
so he went for the soft money .
started dealing , started getting so far it' s happening wingst .
i' m telling you .
if davey was raped , he was one of them who did it .
a fucking branchy dildo .
yes .
it' s stella .
fine .
i' m davey graham' s brother .
all i want is his name .
are you fucking listening ?
are you ?
i can' t , if he knows , he' il kill me .
you are fucking dead already !
do you know what he did to davey ?
what i did , was phoning from the flat .
i didn' t have any thing to do .
he wouldn' t tell me .
he raped him .
that' s why davey killed himself .
well his money run clear , ain' t them ?
he' s on call cells with others .
and it' s wrong .
we will need this .
we ?
i' m coming with you .
no , you' re not .
