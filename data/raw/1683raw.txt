this is vogsphere .
yeah , magrathea .
i know it .
no , it' s not .
there is no magrathea .
yes , it is .
what are you doing ?
they took my head .
they have these on arcturan megafreighters .
they use them when they need to concentrate .
what is it ?
it' s a thinking cap .
there you go .
should give him some zest for about ten minutes or so .
now i' m feeling much better about our predicament .
i checked the guide for how to rescue a prisoner from vogsphere .
it said don' t .
i' m assuming you have a better plan .
well , i kind of had this idea that we could ...
ow !
did anyone see that ?
see what ?
what was it ?
uh ...
nothing , it' s , uh , nothing .
it' s just my imagination .
okay , right .
now , everyone just stop a minute , please , and look at me .
there' s ... definitely something going on here .
just ... just watch .
just watch .
okay , i think we ...
oooh !
ah ha !
you too !
yeah , what was that ?
i thi ...
zaphod , what do you think ?
i think ...
ow !
zarquon !
what was that ?
jeez !
i' d make a suggestion , but you wouldn' t listen .
no one ever does .
i have an idea .
ooh , ooh , ooh , ford !

okay , don' t think .
nobody think .
no ideas .
no theories .

trillian is in there somewhere .
we need an idea to save her .
i have an ide ...
ah !
run !
yeeaaghh !
ooh !
ah !
you' re supposed to stop .
okay , so i' m not thinking .
not thinking .
no ideas coming .
okay , this isn' t an idea that has any merit at all , but , marvin , can you give me a hand ?
okay , where is she ? !
who , the director of robot arm repair ?
tricia yggarstuk mcmillanus of ...
blaard ?
no , tricia marie mcmillan of earth .
oh .
right .
sorry , no record of earth .
galactic sector zz9 plural z alpha ?
oh , yes .
she' s lying .
she' s skinny , and she' s pretty , and she' s lying .
mmmm .
here we are .
earth .
oh .
um , " destroyed .
um , do you have a second home planet ?
destroyed ?
that' s impossible .
that' s what it says here .
says it was destroyed to make way for a hyperspace expressway .
who in their right mind gives an order to destroy a planet ?
he said the gray building , right ?
all the buildings are gray .
give me a hand . " ha ha , very funny .
how am i supposed to drive this pod with one arm ?
stupid human .
go and fill that in .
then , make sure , when you fill in the facilitating form ...
leave this to me .
i' m british .
i know how to queue .
if you' d fill that form in for me , and return it as soon as possible .
writing implements to your left ...
you' re president .
can you do anything ?
presidents don' t have power .
their job is to draw attention away from it .
hey , how you doin ' ?
hey , it' s me , your president !
what' s goin ' on ?
thanks for coming .
all right .
i know that sponge .
all right !
next !
president coming through .
how you doin ' , pinhead ?
no , really , it' s me .
i love kabuki .
look at that .
out the way .
give us a kiss !
hi , i' ve come about release of a prisoner .
prisoner release form .
oh , wha ... ?
i don' t believe you .
these are the orders .
love and kisses " ? !
mm .
now , according to the galactic penal code , the punishment for a presidential kidnapping is to be fed to the ravenous bugblatter beast of traal .
good day .
ow , get off of me !
ow !
what the hell is that ?
ow , no , wait , wait !
there' s been some kind of mistake .
ah !
tick all the boxes on the right .
right .
got it .
not that one !
what to do if you find yourself stuck with no hope of rescue .
consider how lucky you are that life has been good to you so far .
alternatively , if life hasn' t been good to you so far , which , given your current circumstances seems more likely , consider how lucky you are that it won' t be troubling you much longer .
right , there we go .
oh , kidnapping the president .
oh , no , she' s not eligible for release at this time .
okay .
right .
look , this is the president .
oh !
okay .
see , there ?
he says the kidnapping business was a horrible misunderstanding .
oh , yeah .
she meant nothing by it .
he' s ordering you to let her go .
but this isn' t a presidential release of prisoner form .
those are blue .
i' il stay here .
all right .
hold that .
okay .
wai ...
oh , he' s hungry today .
that' s blue .
right .
i' m not a journalist .
we' re just hanging out .
okay , this is , uh , it' s for tricia mcmillan .
tricia mcmillan .
mm .
okay .
sir , it' s a release form .
thank you .
she' s free to go .
release her .
zaphod' s here .
well , then , uh , that' s fine then .
let' s just go and get him .
who are we waiting for again ?
no , i' m serious .
tricia !
tricia .
trill .
hey , come on .
you idiot !
you signed the order to destroy earth .
he did ?
i did ?
yes .
love and kisses , zaphod " ?
you didn' t even read it , did you ?
honey , i' m president of the galaxy .
i don' t get a lot of time for reading .
an entire planet , my home , destroyed because you thought they wanted your autograph .
they framed me !
are you an idiot ?
trillian .
you knew .
why didn' t you tell me ?
he threatened me .
get a backbone , arthur .
oh , a backbone ?
what about coming here to rescue you ?
thank you .
my idea .
oh !
stupid !
got your arm .
how considerate .
right , then , all those lucky enough to have two arms , hold tight .
oh , the president tests my patience .
this time i shall pursue him myself .
ready my ship .
fantastic .
at last .
oh .
that' s one hour for lunch , everybody .
i think i' il have soup today .
the encyclopedia galactica , in its chapter on love , states that it is far too complicated to define .
the hitchhiker' s guide to the galaxy has this to say on love .
avoid , if at all possible .
unfortunately , arthur dent has never read
the hitchhiker' s guide to the galaxy .
oh , i' m so sorry .
no , come in .
i ...
i didn' t ...
um , look , uh ...
trillian , i just wanted to say , you were right ,
i should' ve told you , and i understand totally if you' re angry with me .
um , for what it' s worth , i know how you must be feeling ...
can you hand me a towel ?
yeah , sure , this ...
thank you .
actually , what i was going to say was ... ... if i' d said yes to you and gone to madagascar , then neither of us would be here now .
i just thought that might count for something .
it doesn' t matter .
all right , computer , take us to ...
where are we ...
where we headed again ?
okay , i' m gonna get you another lemon .
all right .
engaging improbability drive .
no , zaphod , no .
buttons are not toys .
what did you do ?
magrathean coordinates accepted .
it blows my circuits to tell you that we' re in orbit , at an altitude of 300 miles , around the legendary planet of magrathea .
magrathea !
magrathea !
magrathea !
unbelievable .
it' s even worse than i thought it would be .
greetings .
this is a recorded announcement as we are all out .
the commercial council of magrathea thanks you for your visit , but regrets that the entire planet is temporarily closed .
if you' d like to leave your name and a planet where you can be contacted , kindly do so at the tone .
how can a planet be closed ?
zarkin ' a , cousin .
okay , computer , keep going .
take us down .
i' d be happy to .
it is gratifying that your enthusiasm for our planet continues unabated .
as a token of our appreciation , we hope you will enjoy the two thermo nuclear missiles we' ve just sent to converge with your craft .
to ensure on going quality of service , your death may be monitored for training purposes .
thank you .
i' m delighted to tell you there are two nuclear missiles heading right for us .
if you don' t mind , i' m going to take evasive action .
something' s jamming my guidance system .
impact minus 45 seconds .
computer , do something !
sure .
handing over manual control .
good luck .
i need some help .
i can' t do this without my third arm .
arthur , grab my hand !
did we lose ' em ?
no , they' re coming right at us .
why don' t i just press this ?
no , we' re not back to normal yet .
what will happen ?
i don' t know .
don' t do it !
we' re here .
no telling where it' il send us .
sod it all .
no !
wow .
where are we ?
exactly where we were .
and the missiles ?
apparently , they' ve turned ... into a bowl of petunias .
and a very surprised looking whale .
and an improbability factor of 8, 767, 128 to 1 against .
we have norm ... normality .
normality , right .
we can talk about normality till the cows come home .
what is normal ?
what' s home ?
what are cows ?
a proper cup of tea would restore my normality .
it is important to note that suddenly , and against all probability , a sperm whale had been called into existence several miles above the surface of an alien planet .
since this is not a tenable position for a whale , this innocent creature had very little time to come to terms with its identity .
ah , whoa , what' s happening ?
who am i ?
why am i here ?
what' s my purpose ?
what do i mean by who am i ?
okay , okay , calm down , get a grip now .
ooh , this is an interesting sensation .
a sort of tingling in my ...
i better start finding names for things .
let' s call it a tail .
yeah , tail .
what' s this roaring sound whooshing past what i' m gonna call my head ?
wind .
is that a good name ?
that' il do .
yay , this is really exciting .
i' m dizzy with anticipation .
or is it the wind ?
there' s a lot of that now .
and what' s this thing coming towards me very fast ?
so big and flat and round .
it needs a big wide sounding name like ow , ound , round , ground !
that' s it , ground .
i wonder if it will be friends with me .
hello , ground .
the only thing that went through the mind of the bowl of petunias as it fell was , " oh , no , not again !
many have speculated that if we knew why the petunias had thought that , we should know a lot more about the nature of the universe than we do now .
what are those things ?
they' re portals to another dimension .
right .
i don' t suppose this portal has central heating , does it ?
ah , this is the one .
this will all end in tears , i just know it .
right here .
hey !
whoa !
okay , in we go !
we can' t just step into that ... that !
we don' t know where it leads .
if we pick the wrong one , we just ... we come back , we pick another one .
it' s no biggie .
what ?
yeah , it' s a big biggie , ford .
a big biggie .
what if it rips us all into tiny little atomic particle thingies ?
this is the right one .
i have a hunch .
ford !
his hunches are good .
arthur , i say we go .
go with the hunch of a man whose brain is fuelled by lemons ? !
this is suicide !
i think i resent that .
i don' t care .
i' m getting hostility from you , alex ...
arthur !
have you ever tried yoga ?
trillian !
i think that' s supposed to happen .
she' s gone !
ford , she' s gone !
arthur , don' t panic !
ford !
hey , wait for me !
whoo !
come on .
idiot !
come on , come on , come on , come on !
ahhh !
no , no , no , don' t leave .
come on , come on , just start !
i told you this would end in tears .
did you ?
did you ?
geronimo !
ooomph !
far out !
far out !
ha ha !
this is it .
this is it !
deep thought .
i' m a coming .
so , this is how it' s all going to end , is it ?
me , alone on a dead planet , with a manically depressed robot .
you think you' ve got problems .
what if you are a manically depressed robot ?
excuse me .
aaaaagghhh !
whoa , whoa .
who are you ?
no , uh , my name is not important .
uh , you must come with me .
get away .
terrible events are afoot .
um , you ... you must come or you' il be late .
late ?
what for ?
what ?
no , no .
what' s ... what' s your name , earthman ?
dent .
arthur dent .
well ...
iate as in " the late dentarthurdent .
it' s a sort of threat , do you see ?
no .
no .
your friends are safe .
you can trust me .
a man who won' t tell me his name ?
okay , my name is , um ... ... my name is ... is ... is ...
slartibartfast .
i ...
i ...
i said it wasn' t important .
well ... so my friends are safe ?
let me show you .
i could calculate your chances of survival , but you won' t like it .
did you know we built planets ?
oh , yes , fascinating trade .
doing the , um ... doing the coastlines was always my favorite .
we used to have endless fun doing the little fiddly bits around the fjords .
but then the galactic economy collapsed , and seeing that custom built planets are a ... are a bit of a luxury commodity ...
come with me because there' s been a terrible mix up with your planet .
best laid plans of mice , you know .
and men .
what ?
best laid plans of mice and men .
yes , well , i don' t think men have much to do with it .
here .
um , i must warn you , we' re going to pass through , well , a sort of gateway thing .
huh ?
it may disturb you .
it scares the willies out of me .
aghh !
aghh !
ha , ha , ha .
welcome to our factory floor .
okay .
all right .
all right .
yeah , this is it .
this is it .
o great deep thought !
we have traveled long ... ... and far .
have you calculated the ultimate question of life , the universe and everyhing ?
no .
what ?
i' ve been watching tv .
oh .
i designed another computer to do that .
oh , right , i forgot .
is it here ?
no , it' s not here .
it' s another world .
it' s on another world .
it is another world , stupid .
or it was until the vogons destroyed it to make way for a hyperspace expressway .
well ...
okay .
you sure you don' t have the question , or a way to , you know , access it or something ?
' cause i think i' ve done a lot to get here .
oh , shh , shh .
the show' s back on .
well , i don' t wanna bother you , so i' m gonna ...
good stuff .
great .
i' m gonna go and find something else for my entire life to be about .
zaphod , zaphod , there' s the ... the gun .
gun ?
that humma sent you for .
you gave him your head .
why' d i ...
why' d i do that ?
okay .
that' s stupid .
o deep thought , we were told that there is a gun .
there you are .
hm ?
look familiar ?
so it wasn' t destroyed ?
actually , it was .
this is a backup .
earth mark ll .
so you ... you made the earth ?
not me alone , but i ...
i did my part .
ever heard of a place , i think it' s called norway ?
that was one of mine .
i ...
i got an award for it .
oh , hoo !
all right , frank ?
that' s ... that' s frank .
ah ha .
they ... they' ve nearly finished the oceans .
zaphod .
here , it' s ... ... it' s just like humma said .
now you can go get your head back .
hey , ford .
it' s been nice knowing you , you zarking frood .
no !
whoa !
this is a bust too .
h ...
h ...
hey , man .
you know , you must really be frustrated .
you go through all you have , you don' t get an answer , which means no money or fame , which you deserve ...
the point of view gun , conveniently , does precisely what its name suggests .
fantastic .
fantastic .
fantastic .
if you point it at someone and pull the trigger , they instantly see things from your point of view .
give me that thing .
it was designed by deep thought , but commissioned by a consortium of intergalactic angry housewives who , after arguments with their husbands , were sick of ending those arguments with the phrase ,
you just don' t get it , do you ?
uh , uh , and you' re right , i shouldn' t be so upset because life goes on , you know , and i should just go on with it .
shoot him again .
whoa .
hitchhiking' s good .
towels are good too .
say what ?
that is brilliant .
what' s goin ' ... ?
i can see why humma kavula would want one of these .
we better get back .
arthur' s waiting .
who cares ?
i do .
especially since we' re somewhat of an endangered species , thanks to you .
why so edgy , baby doll ?
relax .
you wanna know why i' m edgy ?
argh .
of course you' re edgy .
your planet' s been blown up and you' ve been tooling around with the guy who signed the order .
huh ?
ugh !
you actually wanted to know the question because you always wondered if there was more to life and now you' re crushed because you find out there really isn' t .
hey , fantastic .
psychedelic .
you' ve got no home , no family , and you' re stuck with me , another in a long line of men who doesn' t really get you .
huh ?
that' s not true .
and you' re worried you might have blown it with the one guy who really does .
hey , whoops .
oh , baby doll .
give me that thing .
it won' t affect me .
i' m already a woman .
it' s okay .
it' s only a couple of little mice !
voila !
himalayas .
good , eh ?
earthman , you must realize that the planet you lived on was commissioned , paid for and run by mice .
when you say mice , do you mean the little furry white creatures with whiskers , ears , cheese ?
yeah , but they' re protrusions into our dimension of hyperintelligent beings .
i don' t know this cheese of which you speak , but they were there on earth as mice experimenting on you .
i see where you' ve become confused now .
you see , we were experimenting on them .
ah , no , well , yeah , no .
that' s what they wanted you to think , but you were actually elements in their computer program .
actually , this explains a lot .
all my life , i' ve had this strange feeling there' s something big and sinister going on in the world .
no , that' s normal paranoia .
everyone in the universe gets that .
perhaps i' m old and tired , but the chances of finding out what' s actually going on are so absurdly remote that the only thing to do is say hang the sense of it and keep yourself busy .
i' d much rather be happy than right any day .
and are you ?
uh ... no .
that' s where it all falls down , of course .
here you are then .
is this ... ?
it' s , um ...
it' s all there .
you know , it all works .
welcome home .
hey !
hey , man !
there you are !
surprise !
what are you doing ?
what happened to you ?
is that tea ?
first , our hosts attacked us .
right .
but then they made up for it by making us ... [ tearfully ] ... this amazing meal .
it' s so ...
everyhing' s right .
everyhing' s delicious .
oh , come on , that' s lovely .
we' re glad you like it , earth creature .
the , um , talking ... talking mice .
cool .
sit , earthman .
oh , thank you .
thank you for that .
please , drink .
um , uh , excuse me .
uh , is there anything else ?
no , we' re quite happy , thank you .
um , good , i' il be outside , so ...
you were right .
please , drink .
yes .
he was right .
now , to business .
to business !
eat !
shh .
sorry .
we' ve spent a lot of time on your planet
iooking for this ultimate question .
only to have it blow up in our faces .
literally .
which is why you' re here .
we' ve been offered a lucrative contract to do several 5 d tv chat shows .
but here' s the point .
we must have product .
we need the ultimate question , or one that sounds ultimate .
of course .
we' ve rebuilt the planet .
now all we need is the missing piece of the puzzle .
which happens to be your brain .
right .
more tea ?
sorry , did you just say you need my brain ?
yes , to complete the program .
you can' t have my brain .
i' m using it .
hardly .
hardly ?
cheeky ...
cheeky mouse .
zaphod !
trillian !
ford .
what was in that food ?
what was in my tea ?
don' t worry .
you won' t feel a thing .
just wait a sodding minute .
you want a question that goes with the answer 42 ?
what about , what' s 6x7 ?
or , um , uh , how many vogons does it take to change a light bulb ?
here' s one : how many roads must a man walk down ?
hey , that' s not bad .
fine .
fine , take it , ' cause my head is filled with questions , and no answer to any one of them has ever brought me one iota of happiness .
except for one .
the one .
the only question i' ve ever wanted an answer to .
is she the one ?
the answer bloody well isn' t 42 , it' s yes .
undoubtedly , unequivocally , unabashedly , yes .
and for one week , one week in my sad little ... blip of an existence ... ... it made me happy .
that' s a good answer .
we don' t want to be happy .
we want to be famous .
what' s this " ls she the one " tripe ?
take his brain !
no , don' t take the brain !
don' t take the brain , mice !
it wasn' t me !
i' m famous .
shoot him , quickly , shoot him !
oh , bollocks !
agghh !
i' m gonna be sick .
belgium .
follow me .
left , right , left , right .
attention !
thanks a lot for leaving me behind .
though i can' t say i blame you .
mr president , we' re here for your protection .
thanks , man .
i appreciate it .
fire !
no !
no !
what' s all the fuss about ?
vogons are the worst marksmen in the galaxy .
ooh .
for god' s sake , stop !
cease fire .
now i' ve got a headache ... headache ... headache ...
marvin !
oh , no .
he' s got a towel , run away !
i' m gonna get us outta here .
how do you drive this thing ?
we need that gun .
come on .
get this ship started .
come on .
start !
come on .
oh , fire , fire !
fire , fire !
oo , hoo , hoo , hoo , hoo !
he' s locked it from the other side .
we' il have to go the other way .
come on , let' s go !
stop !
oh , no !
stop it !
stop it !
stop shooting at us !
oh , i feel so depressed .
i can' t face another day .
what' s the point ?
you all right ?
yeah .
sorry about your spaceship , arthur .
marvin , you saved our lives .
i know .
wretched , isn' t it ?
you got to ask yourself , what' s the point ?
take it away .
you could do all of that , but it' s not gonna ... well , i' il ask ...
i' il just ask .
i ...
i ...
i' ve just been informed by some of the lads that since we' re so near completion , we' re gonna go ahead and finish earth .
oh .
we , well , we can put it back exactly as it was when you left , you know .
unless there' s , um ... ... there' s , you know , anything you want to change .
something you think your planet could do without .
yeah .
me .
oh !
um , hello ?
no , as is .
yep , leave it .
yep .
let' s go somewhere .
definitely .
where did you have in mind ?
i know this great restaurant at the end of the universe .
i am a little peckish .
i need to go to humma' s .
he' s got something of mine .
i think .
i' m so confused .
don' t worry , baby .
we' il sort it out .
all right , let' s trip the light fantastic , baby .
just you and me .
come on .
you got your towel ?
yeah .
why ?
am i going to need it ?
only always .
right .
yeah .
i wouldn' t want to go anywhere without my wonderful towel .
okay .
hold tight .
stand by for commencement of life cycle .
in three , two , one ...
all right !
whoo !
not that anyone cares what i say , but the restaurant is at the other end of the universe .
yeah !
play it !
it is , of course , well known that careless talk costs lives .
but the full scale of the problem is not always appreciated .
for instance , at the very moment that arthur dent said ,
i wouldn' t want to go anywhere without my wonderful towel " a freak wormhole opened up in the fabric of the space time continuum and carried his words far , far back in time , across almost infinite reaches of space , to a distant galaxy where strange and warlike beings were poised on the brink of frightful interstellar battle .
the two opposing leaders , resplendent in their black jeweled battle shorts were meeting for the last time , when a dreadful silence fell .
and at that very moment , the words " i wouldn' t want to go anywhere without my wonderful towel " drifted across the conference table .
unfortunately , in their native tongue , this was the most appalling insult imaginable .
so the opposing battle fleets decided to settle their remaining differences , in order to launch a joint attack on our galaxy , now positively identified as the source of the offending remark .
for thousands of years , the mighty starships tore across the empty wastes of space and finally dived screaming onto the planet earth , where , due to a terrible miscalculation of scale , the entire battle fleet was accidentally swallowed by a small dog .
those who study the complex interplay of cause and effect in the history of the universe , say that this sort of thing is going on all the time .
