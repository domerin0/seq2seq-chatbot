yes .
there is that chance .
but you are the one who grabbed me and pretend i' m your husband .
you' re probably one of those crazy american women
like ' charlie' s angels , ' and you are going to kung fu me and steal my car .
but i' m willing to take the chance .
you' re willing ?

above my cousin' s antique store .
did you ever taste this ?
what is that ?
it' s limoncello .
we made this .
you made it ?
yeah .
we take the lemon , and we take off the skin of the lemon , and then we put in the bottle with 3/ 4 of alcohol and 1/ 4 of sugar .
and you put the skin of the lemon in the bottle , and you leave it until it' s dried color .
and i forget the rest .
but just try it .

i run into you in the street in rome , and now we' re here .
didn' t you have plans today ?
didn' t you have something you had to do ?
so what ?
if you smash into something good , you should hold on until it' s time to let go .
and now is not the time .
not in my opinion .
no .
you have beautiful eyes , francesca .
i wish i could swim inside them .
what ?
no .
it' s just that' s exactly what american women think italian men say .
i guess .
thank you .
marcello , i' m sorry .
i' m so sorry .
i' m sorry .
i' m really nervous , you know .
i was married for a long time .
and since then , there hasn' t been anybody .
would you like to help me change that ?
you are asking me to sleep with you ?
yes .
that is exactly the kind of thing we italian men think american women say .
you honor me with your offer .
francesca .
yes ?
i' m going to make love all over you .
mamma mia !
che bella spalla .
what is spalla ?
shoulder .
and what do you call this ?
la gola .
and this ?
il capezzolo .
il capezzolo .
and this ?
esausto .
exhausted ?
exhausted .
at least for the next 5 minutes .

it' s terrible that you bought that villa in cortona .

i hear the town midwife' s good .
she puts a knife under the bed to cut the pain .
florence is an hour away .
you' re gonna deliver this baby in a hospital gown designed by armani .
she ran out on me .
she said she realized she didn' t want to be a mother after all .
oh , disaster , frances .
how do you do it ?
how do you ever breathe again ?
pretty soon .

marcello , i really think i' d better stay here .
oh , i' m sorry .

okay , well how about the one after that ?
no , of course , i understand .
i won' t forget you .
i think a lot about you , too .

there' s something strange about these trees .
it' s like they know .
and they know that we know that they know .
they' re creepy .
creepy italian trees .
the baby' s gonna like them
' cause it' s gonna be a creepy italian baby who goes around saying , ' ciao , mamma , ' and doing that backward hand wave thing .
life is strange .
where were you going when i arrived ?
nowhere important .
what' s he like ?
he' s a creepy italian .
so go see him .
i will .
i want to spend time with my creepy american friend .
i refuse to screw up your love life .
don' t be ridiculous , patti .
you are my love life .
frances , could you come up here , please ?
there' s hot water in the toilet bowl .
oh , my god .
that' s close to boiling .
mm hmm .
they must have crossed a pipe somewhere .
oh , this is really bad , isn' t it ?
well , it' s not good , unless you want to give your ass a facial .
that' s a contradiction in terms .
i guess it' d be more of an ass cial .
oh , god .
go .
go , go , go .
i' m sorry , frances !
he' s sorry .
we have nowhere else to be together .
what does that make me ?
saint francesca , patron saint of horny teenagers ?
pawel , you were doing it in my bed .
i don' t even do it in my bed .
please , francesca , help us .
my father don' t let us see each other .
maybe he thinks you' re young and shouldn' t be ...
it' s because i' m polish .
it will be terrible if we are not together .
' assassinate . ' did you say ' assassinate ' ?
did she say you were going to assassinate somebody ?
no , she misunderstand .
i didn' t say ...
amore , i didn' t say , ' assassino . '
i said , ' i' m going to ask nino ' for money to help us get married .
oh !
' ask nino . ' oh !
i didn' t understand .
married ?
you barely understand what the other is saying .
we are in love .
and i go with him this weekend .
to the flag throwing festival .
i am going to throw the flag .
throw the flag .
why ?
because i can do it as good as any italian man .
that' s why .
and her father will see .
francesca ?
francesca ?
my father .
francesca .
placido , hi .
my daughter says you are taking her to the festa in montepulciano .
this is true ?
just a moment , please .
i told him you' re taking me so he will stay home .
i don' t want to lie to your father .
come on , frances .
who cares ?
frances ?
if i am not with her , i will die of a broken heart .
you won' t die .
isn' t he great ?
oh , there he is !
these are straight men .
in tights twirling flags .

they' re fine .
let' s go .
what is it about love that makes us so stupid ?
take the man with the flowers .
same deal every day .
i mean , enough already .
why can he just let it go and get over it ?
francesca , you see my daughter ?
she seems so different .
really ?
oh , chiara is not herself .
maybe do you know what' s bothering her ?
placido , i don' t know .
hey , frances , look .
you can see bramasole from here .
see ?
thank you .
it' s marcello !
oh , my god !
wait a minute .
what ?
what' s he doing ?
don' t go !
where are you going ?
patti !
marcello !
marcello !
wait !
marcello !
we tried you on your cell , but you were in a dead zone .
i cannot believe you let him leave .
he said he couldn' t wait .
couldn' t wait ?
why ?
he was on his way to arezzo .
he was nearby and thought he' d take a shot .
he was very disappointed , okay ?
you' ve got a snail in your ear .
good .
really ?
no !
get it out !
he left you a note .
hold still .
he' s going north for a couple of weeks .
oh , my god .
he had a dream about me in a white dress .
a white dress ?
holy shit !
damn it , patti , why didn' t you make him wait ?
i mean , come on , you' re a tough dyke .
you could have tied him to a chair !
you could have faked labor at least !
i wouldn' t have had to fake it .
ten fingers .
ten toes .
i commend you on a classic choice .
what' s her name , mom ?
alexandra .
in italian , the literal translation of ' to give birth , '
' dare alla luce , ' is to give to the light .
alexandra .
welcome to the light .
all right .
hi !
yes !
yes !
hello , sweetheart .
alexandra .
alexandra .
okay , i can ...
hey , baby .
oh , you' re so cute .
you' re so cute .
frances .
we are finished .
poland .
dziekuje .
dziekuje .
come back soon .
i' il cook for you .
pawel , you too ?
chiara is waiting !
patti , you want to come with me to town ?
we could bring the baby .
i have to buy a white dress .
excuse me .
could you give me a lift ?
with pleasure .
grazie .
grazie .
i could wait and take you back .
thanks , but i' ve got my boyfriend .
marcello !
marcello !
francesca .
wait there , i' m coming down .
francesca .
look how beautiful you are .
it' s incredible to see you .
every time we made plans , it didn' t happen .
so this time , i thought i' il surprise you .
i am surprised .
what brings you to positano ?
what brings me to positano ?
what brings me to positano ?
marcello .
we' re going to be late .
one moment , darling .
i' il be right there .
i came at a bad time .
francesca , wait .
wait .
wait !
i' m sorry you' re hurt .
but what did you expect ?
what did i expect ?
you came to bramasole .
you left that note .
i thought that you ...
wait .
just a minute .
months ago , we had a beautiful affair .
and if you think i wanted more of you after that , you' re right .
because i did , of course .
you' re a fantastic woman , francesca .
but we were never able to come together again , even though we tried .
and this sort of thing must come naturally .
i told you .
there was my friend .
she was going to have a baby .
there were many , many other things .
important things you had to do .
and you couldn' t wait .
right ?
don' t worry , francesca .
don' t worry .
there is nothing to regret .
do you regret this ?
i don' t ...
there is someone for you , francesca .
goodbye .
francesca !
she' s in the fountain !
who is in the fountain ?
the crazy blonde !
what' s going on here ?
she is sylvia in ' la dolce vita . '
she' s very good , actually .
is she drunk ?
i hope so .
you know , in ' la dolce vita , ' he goes in and he gets her .
mastroianni .
he goes in , and he fishes her out .
katherine .
thank you .
do you think i make a good sylvia ?
you were wonderful .
here .
i see zeus is gone .
back to mount olympus .
i' m so sorry .
don' t be .
i' m fine now .
there' s nothing like a fountain and a magnum of french champagne to put you right again .
really ?
what do you think ?
you know who i really love the most from all the films ?
cabiria .
you remember at the end when another man has left her in the most terrible way , and she thinks it' s all over for her ?
then she sees some children playing in the street , making music .
and before she knows it ... she' s smiling again .
that' s what fefe always said .
no matter what happens ... always keep your childish innocence .
it' s the most important thing .
you' re back ?
what happened ?
how' d it go with marcello ?
i don' t want to talk about it .
chiara' s here .
she' s upset .
she' s out in the garden talking with pawel .
i can' t talk about it now .
oh .
fran .
stupid .
stupid !
what more can i do ?
it' s okay .
it' s not your fault .
babbo .
i want to ask your permission to marry your daughter .
it' s nice , but it' s out of the question .
i have come here to ask your permission to marry your daughter .
i will love her forever , and i know that i will make her happy .
all young men say this .
sometimes it' s true .
never .
never ?
what about you two ?
don' t be ridiculous .
i hate him half of the time .
placido , don' t you want chiara to be happy in love ?
happy .
happy is about a lot of things .
it' s not just about young passion .
this doesn' t last , chiara , and when it' s over , what you will have left is nothing .
he has nothing to offer you .
i have everything to offer her .
everything .
pawel , let' s go .
chiara !
wait .
wait .
won' t you give your blessing ?
what if this is it ?
the real thing .
a love that lasts forever .
what you describe is all in fairy tales .
no , it' s not .
and how do you know ?
from personal experience ?
no , i looked for it , and i didn' t find it .
but that doesn' t mean it doesn' t exist .
that' s exactly what it means .
no one has had it .
i did !
i had a great love .
mamma !
your father ... a great love .
and i' il never forget it .
mamma !
mamma !
he' s a poor polish laborer .
he is nobody .
he has no family !
that' s not true .
he has me .
i' m his family .
i' m his family .
chiara .
pawel .
amen .
amen .
amen .
amen .
okay , yes .
okay .
mamma !
what are you thinking ?
what do i think ?
tell me .
i think you got your wish .
my wish ?
that day we looked for your snake you said to me that you wanted there to be a wedding here .
yeah .
and you said you wanted there to be a family here .
you' re right .
i got my wish .
i got everything that i asked for .
mi scusi .
you are looking for the american writer who lives here , and you found her .
if you don' t mind , i' il just ...
there .
it was crawling on you .
a ladybug .
do i know you ?
not really .
you reviewed one of my books once .
did i like it ?
not very much .
oh , no .
don' t worry .
it was , by far , the very best bad review i' ve ever received .
you' re kidding .
i' m not .
it helped me get to my next book .
anyway , i' ve been traveling around tuscany .
someone said that you lived up here .
i' m ed .
hi .
i' m frances .
hi .
there' s a wedding going on .
this isn' t your wedding .
that would be unfortunate .
they say they built the train tracks over the alps before there was a train that could make the trip .
they built it anyway .
they knew one day the train would come .
any arbitrary turning along the way , and i would be elsewhere .
i would be different .
what are four walls , anyway ?
they are what they contain .
the house protects the dreamer .
unthinkably good things can happen , even late in the game .
it' s such a surprise .
