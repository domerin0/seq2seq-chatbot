not china .
not yet .
passepartout ?
you look troubled .
i cannot keep lying to mr. fogg .
thank you , miss la roche .
you may just have saved our trip .
you did what you had to .
the fate of your village is of far greater importance
there you are .
i would , uh ... than any bet phileas has made .
i would like to repay you .
take me with you .
if he loses , all it will cost him his money and pride .
what ?
i' m stifled here .
pigeonholed .
no , mr. fogg will lose much more than that .
they think of me only as a coat check girl !
what do you mean ?
why ?
because i am the coat check girl .
ah .
look .
the leading art critic in paris .
my village !
look what he wrote about one of my paintings .
i can' t read this .
it' s french .
i wish i couldn' t .
your village ?
uh ...
i mean ,
why do you carry it ?
when i do succeed , i can throw it in his face , but for now , my , what a village !
oh , it' s beautiful !
i need a world journey to inspire me .
we do need to stop and resupply , but we must be off by morning .
i' m inspired to get us back on schedule .
let' s see .
wind velocity approximately twelve knots ,
factoring in air density ...
outstanding !
passepartout , onward !
ah .
lau xing , lau xing .
lau xing , lau xing .
lau xing .
lau xing .
lau xing .
there we go .
passepartout , tell him to keep the change .
uh ...
fromage , por favor .
we are going around the world in 80 days !
goodness , that' s quite a welcome .
do these people know him ?
it must be their custom , the way they welcome all strangers .
the balloon cannot support all this weight !
your hot air should compensate , no ?
lau xing .
lau xing .
get off !
what are they doing ?
they' re being disorderly .
hey !
let go !
let go !
hey !
passepartout !
my valise !
it has all my money in it .
whoo !
lau xing .
hey , lady , lady , lady !
it' s my bag .
lau xing .
no , that is my bag .
lau xing .
no , that' s not your bag .
it' s my bag !
no !
you crazy .
ah .
uh ...
yes .
that tickles !
you took my bag .
mr. fogg !
good catch !
thank you .
oh .
it' s beautiful .
you are very talented .
ooh !
thank you .
you need more blue .
those are the gallery bandits .
fascinating .
absolutely fascinating .
oh , yes !
sorry ?
ah .
he stole my purse !
this devil stole my purse !
vile .
absolutely vile .
welcome home , lau xing .
your brothers will be proud .
the whole notion of a lighter than air craft cannot work ,
my bag !
he took my ...
ah !
unless you can harness the power of helium .
or hydrogen , which is far better ...
we' ve stolen that old lady' s purse .
huh .
here .
yes , well , couldn' t have put it better myself .
as for this englishman , do you think such an association is wise ?
we must help passepartout .
how do i make this go lower ?
what are you doing ?
decrease the overall weight ...
he is the most disciplined man i have ever met .
that' s not going to work .
yes , it is .
the crane !
the monkey .
very frightening .
physics , no ?
snake .
yes .
and , of course , the eagle .
phileas ?
phileas , i made this for you .
oh , yes .
oh , that' s very , very good .
yes .
ahhh ...
ooh !
ay !
owww .
what does this say ?
stupid .
lau xing ...
bonjour .
bonjour .
eh ?
bye bye !
wake up , lady !
wake up , lady !
wake up !
lady , wake up !
i' ve had quite enough .
i just ...
i ...
bye , mama .
merci .
bye , baby .
ohh ...
very impressive .
i' d have let go by now .
the statue' s grabbing his trousers .
ahhh .
i am going to be abominably ill .
i don' t think it' s doing it on purpose .
oh , dear .
i ...
i want to die .
please kill me .
help !
well done , passepartout .
we' re still on schedule despite those dogged thieves .
yes , yes .
thank you .
those art thieves seemed to recognize you .
i look like someone they know .
some other frenchman , perhaps ?
i will find the fastest way to china .
so , where can we drop you off ?
we' re not stopping .
it' s strong .
once we land to board the orient express , you are free to go .
thank you so much .
for what ?
i' m free to go with you .
i did not say you were free to come .
mr. fogg , i was going to tell you .
i said you were free to go .
where ?
anywhere .
thank you .
i will go with you .
this is your family .
my name is not passepartout .
no , you will not , miss la roche .
monique .
it is lau xing .
miss ...
monique !
there !
now we are getting along .
i robbed the bank of england .
you robbed the bank of england ?
comme c' est beau .
not for gold or money , but for the jade buddha .
c' est magnifique .
it was stolen from our village .
toutes ces couleurs .
phileas , he had no other choice .
this was his only way to get home .
look at the sunrise .
there is only one word for it .
" magical .
miss la roche !
i refuse to allow you to continue traveling with us .
you knew about this ?
well ...
i' m not traveling with you .
i' m making my own way .
i have nothing but respect for you , mr. fogg .
maybe you shouldn' t travel with me .
this is what happens when you leave your home .
then respect my deductive reasoning .
you meet ... people !
you have both used me .
you to escape to china , and you to travel to further your impressionistic humbug !
why are you keeping up this ruse ?
your overtures of ... comradeship , of friendship , of ...
perhaps i should inform mr. fogg , and together he and i can speculate .
all that was a means to ensure i would take you along .
my entire life , i got along splendidly by myself .
you' ve been pebbles in my shoe , slowing me down , endangering my life ,
a very sacred object was stolen from my village .
risking everything , all i' ve ever lived for .
i have taken it back .
and you !
you knew that .
incroyable .
for many centuries , the jade buddha has protected my people .
it has never left our village until now .
don' t let him go .
he' il be lost by midnight .
go !
and those art thieves .
who are they ?
the black scorpions .
they work for an evil warlord .
fang .
more of your relatives , i suppose .
she wants the buddha so she can take over my village .
i must return the jade buddha to protect lanzhou .
you can just forget about a reference .
i beg a thousand pardons , mr. fogg .
mr. fogg is the fastest way .
perhaps , then , we can help one another .
i will keep your secret , and you convince mr. fogg
to allow me to travel the world with you .
what' s he screaming about ?
he' s saying , " please , let me go .
i' m bored .
why is he in prison ?
keep this dummkopf in his seat , or we throw him off !
merely pointing out if they coordinated their coal shoveling technique ,
urinating in public .
charming .
they could maximize our speed .
at least he had the decency to be forthcoming about it .
when we reach constantinople , i suggest you board a train we are not on .
is there anything you' ve told me that' s even remotely true ?
i really can sing .
uh , mr. fogg , she must come with us .
and why is that ? frre jacques , frre jacques dormez vous
uh , we just discovered that we are related from the same family . dormez vous sonnez les matines sonnez les matines ding , ding , ding ding , ding , ding
ding , dang , dong , passepartout .
ding , dang , dong .
i' m her father' s second cousin' s sister on my mother' s side .
french .
look !
monsieur fogg .
if i make the train go faster , i can come with you , oui ?
oh , good .
here comes mr. grumpy and the leatherettes .
yes .
i bid you farewell , miss la roche .
where is the jade buddha ?
you are better off killing me .
you have nerve .
are your comrades so brave ?
your threats don' t frighten me .
nor does your silly bracelet .
all right .
it' s not silly .
if there' s anything else you would like , just let us know , miss la roche .
i spit on you !
france spits on you !
ah !
voil .
vive i' anjou !
champagne with your first class seats , mademoiselle la roche .
your turn will come soon enough .
coward !
merci .
leave them alone .
fight me .
champagne ?
no , thank you .
yes , fight him .
let' s see how ferocious you really are .
merci .
monsieur .
a tea ?
okay .
how to make english tea .
precisely 96 degrees .
ooh .
hey , that' s cheating !
excuse me , sir .
fogg' s valet !
look out !
huh ?
left !
a jade buddha !
this is not a jade buddha .
oh , yes , it is !
you' re right .
but i' m not a valet .
behind you !
oh .
really ?
no !
owww !
hit them !
silence !
me bloody nose !
let me in !
you' re gonna pay for scorchin ' me willy !
you savages !
phileas , help him !
watch out on the right .
huh ?
no , my right .
stop helping me !
what' s happening ?
heh heh heh heh .
now i gotcha .
where is passepartout ?
how is he getting on ?
ow !
oh !
ow !
i wouldn' t say he' s winning , but , uh , i think he' s doing all right .
ahhh !
you' re under arrest !
ah !
ooh !
ow !
go home to mama .
sorry !
huh ?
why the devil are we stopping ?
what took you so long ?
i had to finish my lunch .
prince hapi would be honored to have fogg and his traveling companions at his banquet .
wong fei hung !
how very flattering .
surely you' re not foolish enough to take on all of my men by yourself ?
but please inform prince " happy " that we are on a very tight schedule .
prince hapi demands it .
then prince hapi will have to get accustomed
ten tigers ?
to not getting everything he wants .
kill them !
execute the prisoners !
i want their heads on pikes !
what' s happening ?
phileas !
ohhh !
passepartout ...
knife !
merci .
you' re welcome .
you promise me that black scorpions will never come back to lanzhou .
these are my brothers and sister .
the ten tigers .
but there are only nine .
including me .
they' re real .
the legend was true .
mr. fogg ...
passepartout , or whatever your name is , save your apologies .
phileas , he risked his life for what he believes in .
if anyone understands that , you do .
please ensure miss la roche finds safe passage home .
this should be adequate .
oh .
i , uh , believe this is your veil .
i will never dress like a woman again .
ever .
mr. fogg .
please let me help you win your bet .
i have secured the services of a more reliable gentleman .
yes .
well , perhaps i' il just , uh , travel alone .
fifi la belle !
she sings !
she dances !
she does the dance of the ...
you , sir , come right in .
see miss fifi la belle in all her ...
ah , the most modern city in the world .
finally , civilization .
yoo hoo !
excuse me .
pardon me .
can anyone direct me to the pacific railroad station ?
oh , i' m so sorry , sir .
i' m such a ... rutabaga sometimes .
no , no , no .
please , it' s my fault entirely .
let me , uh ...
oh ...
ah !
oh .
oh , lord , i think i sprained my knee .
uh !
ooh .
i should find you a physician .
there' s a doctor who has an office around the corner .
excellent .
well , uh , i' il get him for you .
thank you .
there should be more people like you in this world .
whoo , doggy !
jackpot !
whoo !
mon dieu .
can you imagine phileas alone in a place like this ?
i' m sure he' s fine .
alms .
alms .
alms for the poor ?
arms ?
you already got arms .
it' s money you need .
i can' t even scrounge proficiently .
hey .
cheer up , pal .
you just gotta figure out what' il work for you .
now , what makes you different from them ?
i' m hungry and miserable .
no .
you stink .
your stink is your most powerful weapon in your begging arsenal .
watch this .
hey .
give me money .
sure .
don' t touch me .
you stink .
that guy smells like a dead horse !
i' m not proud of it .
simple , yet effective .
yeah , i see .
you try .
give it a shot .
i got faith in you .
excuse me .
now , uh , you ...
ah .
i' m not gonna lie to you .
that' s gonna happen about half the time .
it' s a volume business .
hunk of cheese ?
oh , yes , i would rather ...
maybe later .
what are them drawings ?
you some kind of devil worshipper ?
don' t you be putting a hex on me .
i' il cut you .
i' m an inventor .
that' s nice .
or , rather , i was .
one day i will build a machine that will allow man to fly .
flying men ?
where ?
nowhere .
where are the flying men ?
where are the flying men ?
over there .
the bird men are coming !
i knew it !
the bird men are coming !
the bird men are coming !
the birds !
the bird men !
bird men !
birds !
i traveled the world for inspiration and found it in a man ... who lives what he dreams .
phileas ?
no .
passepartout !
monique !
mr. fogg .
you crossed the pacific ocean .
for me ?
we will help you win your bet .
mr. fogg , i would never let you down .
but why would you do this ?
because you are our friend , and perhaps ... more .
more with her .
you and me ?
we just stick with friends .
ooh .
oof !
lord kelvin , i can offer you something much more precious than a single jade buddha .
beneath lanzhou are a series of untapped jade reserves .
if the town were to be overrun , those reserves would be ours .
i see .
however , should phileas fogg win this race ,
i will have neither the power nor the means to hand over any arsenal .
then i will see to it personally that mr. fogg' s journey is cut short .
very well .
let us consider our deal to be ...
still , it' s a first rate idea , sir .
what' s this blocking my jade reserves ?
that will have to be demolished .
but that is the great wall of china , sir .
but that is the great wall of china , sir .
it' s not that great .
passepartout went to get help hours ago .
what if he' s lost , or ...
don' t fret , my dear .
passepartout' s a warrior with impeccable survival instincts .
no doubt he' il return with help , and we will board our train with time to spare .
agua .
perhaps i' m being a little optimistic .
help !
help us !
help !
ah !
a rattlesnake !
help !
i don' t want to die !
ah .
good morning .
howdy .
hey .
crazy english cowboy wannabe man .
how' s about going someplace else ?
you' re blocking the path .
wilbur , it' s him .
i' il be damned .
mr. fogg , my name is orville wright .
this is my brother , wilbur .
we' re big fans of yours .
fan' s a strong word .
better way to say it' s we got a lot of money riding on you to win your bet .
we' re gonna use our winnings to build this .
orville , maybe now is not the time .
let me explain it to mr. fogg .
just one second .
forgive my brother .
he' s got his head up in the clouds .
he' s one of these dreamers who thinks man' s gonna go swooshing around on the planet like a little hummingbird .
yeah , we' re all gonna fly .
he thinks so , too .
it' s kind of sad .
i' m sorry .
he' s kind of a moron .
he' s mastered the cable steering system .
the drag and lift ratio .
this is brilliant .
thank you .
that' s what i' ve been saying , but orville doesn' t listen .
all that stuff about mastering ...
that' s what i say .
you gotta have faith in me , no matter how crazy big brother' s dreams sound .
but you told me ...
you gotta have confidence .
you' ve got to speak up and support me .
excuse me , gentlemen .
have you come across our friend on your way here ?
who are we looking for ?
passepartout .
you mean the crazy , half naked chinese guy we saw running around , where he was like ...
singing " frre jacques " ?
with a cow skull on his head ?
possibly .
yes .
he' s in the back of the wagon .
passepartout .
you are alive !
is that you , grandma ?
bye bye .
good luck .
go win the bet .
no pressure , but you gotta win it .
bye .
now , you see , to get the real classy dames , you gotta invent stuff .
i did .
i did " ?
what' s with the " i did " ?
we' re the wright brothers .
we did .
now go .
hyah !
hyah !
they' re not going to make it !
ah ha ha !
new york , new york !
so much to see !
so little time !
our steamer leaves in ten minutes !
go , go , go !
go , go , go !
we' re never going to make it .
phileas fogg ?
autograph this for me ?
it' s for the wife .
certainly .
this business about me robbing the bank of england ...
ah , i' m from ireland .
nice goin ' .
the boat .
follow me .
i know a shortcut .
make a lane !
make a lane !
where are we ?
ah !
whoa !
that' s a big man .
it is a lady .
a french lady .
she looks like an evil chinese warlord to me .
your journey has caused quite a stir , mr. fogg , but i' m afraid it ends here .
leave them alone .
this has nothing to do with them .
on the contrary , lau xing ,
lord kelvin and i have made new arrangements to conquer lanzhou .
unfortunately for mr. fogg , they entail his ... permanent detour .
i knew kelvin was duplicitous , but to align himself with such a little scoundrel !
you' re not a scoundrel , but you are quite small !
as in petite , but most definitely lethal and generally very scary .
one , two ...
go !
three !
go up there .
stop them .
passepartout , my cane !
uh , there .
passepartout !
help !
we are trapped !
help !
passepartout !
help !
there you are !
you have a knife in your buttock .
it' s the evil chinese warlord !
ooh !
huh ?
she' s coming !
the boat !
up there !
hurry !
go , go , go !
go , mr. fogg .
there' s not much time .
wait , wait !
what am i thinking ?
passepartout can' t defeat them .
he' s nine tigers short .
phileas , i do believe you are becoming the man of my dreams .
when this is over , let' s hope the arms and legs of the man of your dreams are still attached to the torso ... of the man of your dreams .
you have failed to stop him .
then your death will have to suffice .
let go of me !
the book !
it' s going to fall !
how can we save ...
phileas ?
i will save him ...
wah !
mr. fogg !
no !
oh .
passepartout ?
passepartout !
huh ?
you' re alive !
are you injured ?
yes , well , uh ...
rules are made to be broken .
or , uh , stabbed by a spiky shoe .
mr. fogg , you missed the ship .
you' il lose your bet .
oh .
at least i didn' t lose a friend .
you must be the eleventh tiger .
meow !
let' s go .
we must catch the next ship .
it would never reach london in time .
no .
no !
no !
we are not giving up !
i almost died !
you almost died !
we take the next ship and win that bet !
very well .
let' s go .
yes !
thank you .
yes .
yes !
yes !
oh , it' s hopeless .
by those calculations , i' m still behind by one day .
there must be some way !
phileas fogg on my boat ?
what an honor , sir !
i' ve quite a penny wagered on you .
the wife' s none too happy about it .
then again , she hasn' t cracked a smile since that shark almost devoured me .
got ' em both in one bite .
ah , it' s inspector fix !
my goodness !
he made it around the world before fogg !
i came back from india the short way , you ninny !
i take it you don' t have phileas fogg in that valise .
a little jade buddha , perhaps ?
that' s the last of the coal , captain .
mr. fogg .
i' m sorry to say , we' ve burnt the last of the coal .
but i' ve had a word with the crew , and all of them ... have agreed to burn their shoes .
the effort is appreciated , captain .
unfortunately , we' ve gained a mere six hours .
even shoes cannot help us now .
must be something we can do .
that' s it .
i' ve got it .
birds .
excellent idea !
we' il burn birds !
no , we' il fly to london .
we follow the laws of physics mastered by the birds millennia ago and combine it with the wright brothers ' steering system .
most people would laugh at you .
but not us .
we care about you .
captain , i' m afraid i have to ask permission to dismantle your ship to build this machine .
dismantle carmen ?
but she' s me livelihood , me most loyal companion .
never , never , ever !
what if i could direct you to an impeccable physician who could replace both your nipples , at my expense , and i will give you enough money to buy a brand new ship ?
you had me at the nipples .
cornelius , fetch me me tools !
now !
aye , aye , captain !
one , two !
one , two !
timber !
i' il go sharpen the propeller .
wrong way .
not looking .
just one more .
that' s it !
right , lads , tie it off !
the greenwich time zone .
the last time i shall set my watch ahead .
well ...
shall we fly ?
let' s .
mr. fogg .
hurrah !
hurrah !
inspiring words .
very well .
prepare for takeoff !
yes , sir !
mr. fogg , are you sure ?
no !
whoa !
how the hell are we getting back ?
whoa !
now !
ohhh !
you did it , phileas !
we are flying !
my god !
it' s ... magical !
better than your dreams ?
better than my dreams .
hey !
don' t forget to steer !
it' s a ... a telegram from ...
general fang , sir .
we' re going to make it !
this all right ?
oh , dear .
this is exactly like a dream i had .
you dream of winning the race ?
no , of crashing to my death .
don' t worry .
i' m gonna get it .
look up there !
great scott !
look !
a flying machine !
don' t step on the wing !
it' s phileas fogg !
sir , rumor has it a flying machine is heading for the royal academy , our bank thief at the pedals .
some people will believe anything .
a flying machine is heading for the academy !
the bank thief is pedaling !
see what i mean ?
help !
well done , passepartout !
the wing ropes !
just a minor setback .
another minor setback .
all right , this is a major setback .
a flying machine is headed for the royal academy , and witnesses swear that it' s phileas fogg .
faster , passepartout !
faster !
we' re losing altitude !
landing gear ?
that would have been an excellent idea !
the bird men are here !
no .
i will not lose this wager !
he is not to reach the top step .
get the police .
here .
now !
i want fogg arrested the moment his feet touch british soil !
oh !
i' m sorry ...
right in my ear !
passepartout , get back in your seat .
we' re going to return to the ground !
stop !
kitchner !
hold your ground !
why are they fleeing ?
cowards !
hold on !
make it to the top step !
new zealand .
we didn' t go there .
top step .
arrest them !
they robbed the bank of england !
no , no !
nonsense !
where is your proof ?
this is the royal academy of science !
we don' t need to prove anything !
besides which , by the time you get out of jail , you' il have lost the wager .
noon .
we did our best .
out of me way !
move it !
i used to be somebody important !
should have thrown him through a higher window .
get off !
get rid of this buffoon !
that' s the thanks i get for going halfway around the world to stop fogg ?
he also sent a chinese warlord to kill phileas fogg !
that' s right .
he did !
lies !
all of it !
kitchner !
yes ?
tell them !
oh , well , yes , uh ...
well , the thing of it ...
you mumbling moron !
salisbury , translate kitchner' s blather .
i ...
me ...
i ...
yes .
yes !
rhodes !
the thing of it is ,
i don' t want to make a fuss .
you spineless cretins !
that man stuck me with quills !
bunches of them !
yes !
lord kelvin' s a bully !
it' s true !
i hate to admit it , but i' m a battered lord .
no !
oh , boo hoo !
so what if i did try to kill phileas fogg ?
what are you gutless peons going to do about it ?
i hold all the power !
i run everything !
so which of you half wits is going to stop me ?
you ?
you ?
you ?
the queen !
the queen ?
oh , the queen !
that inbred , antiquated old cow !
the only way she could stop me is if she sat on me !
with her big , fat royal bottom !
she' s behind me , isn' t she ?
oh , your majesty .
i have just apprehended the culprits who robbed the bank of england .
no , majesty !
rubbish !
quiet !
i love being able to do that .
so , lord kelvin , unsportsmanlike conduct , attempted murder , trading my arsenal for buddhas .
how do you know about that ?
i never said ...
admit it .
you' ve been a naughty boy , haven' t you ?
your majesty , i assure you , there is an explanation for all of this .
what it was , was , was ...
i was ...
i ...
i was simply ... simply ...
why do they always run ?
arrest him .
get out of my way , you fools !
unhand me !
don' t you know who i am ?
i' il kill you !
i' il have you for this , fogg !
so , is this phileas fogg' s miraculous flying invention ?
your majesty , we all invented it .
i' m very impressed , and that doesn' t happen often .
thank you .
but still , we failed to help phileas win his bet .
i' m sorry , phileas .
don' t be , my chri .
i saw the world .
i learnt of new cultures .
i flew across an ocean .
i wore women' s clothing .
oh ?
made a friend .
fell in love .
who cares if i lost a wager ?
i do .
i' ve got 20 quid riding on you .
your majesty , it has gone 12 noon .
correct .
which gives you 24 hours remaining .
could we have miscounted ?
no .
i moved mr. fogg' s watch ahead one hour as we passed each time zone .
the international date line .
we set our watches forward at 20 more time zones , so ... here it' s still day 79 .
so , we' ve ...
we' ve won !
we won , we won ...
thank god .
ah !
your majesty , i ...
i apologize .
do forgive me .
i quite forgot myself .
go and win your bet , mr. fogg .
i shall need a new minister of science .
