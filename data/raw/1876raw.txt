sex 6 years earller
the best fuck of my life .
i don' t even know your name .
it' s better that way .
less complicated .
give me a hint .
anything .
i' d like that .
like a souvenir .
where are you from ?
madrid .
i' m from valencia .
another one .
two more hints each and we go our separate ways .
i' m a paella expert .
that' s logical .
not quite .
keep in mind that you just fucked a world class cook .
you' re right .
everything was delicious .
of course .
a little salty , though .
what about you ?
sure , lots .
let' s hear one .
i was born in madrid on this very day .
around this time .
it' s your birthday !
yes .
my birthday boy from madrid .
what a great way to celebrate !
i' m your paella chef from valencia .
and your birthday gift .
hey , that' s three things !
you gave me only two .
i' m going to look for the third .
i' ve been calling all morning .
it' s not my fault he' s so busy .
then who' s fault is it ?
it' s his job' s fault .
tell him to work less .
i' il call back later .
he still can' t talk .
can i leave him a message ?
of course .
i' il pass it on .
well , let' s see .
i' m pregnant .
since i know it' s not his , and i don' t need him , tell him i' m going to find my child' s father .
you' re leaving ?
that' s right .
i' il give you two a little hint .
he' s not from valencia .
fine , one more hint .
i' m leaving right now for ...
madrid .
they' il advance you 20 percent of what they gave you last time for your novel .
i couldn' t ask for more .
no , it' s fine .
thanks , pepe .
it' il get me through winter .
i' il have it ready by summer .
really ?
you' ve been blocked two years .
i' m figuring out if i' m really a writer .
you ?
a writer ?
to the core .
you cant do other thing .
what about that other story ?
the one about the island .
and the valencian girl ?
maybe .
i' m going to buy smokes .
put lots of sex in it .
people always like it .
yeah , very .
can i talk to you ?
now ?
later , then .
i' m with a friend .
what about ?
well ...
is something wrong ?
yes .
tell me .
now ?
yes .
what' s your name ?
luca .
i' m lorenzo .
i know .
i know you .
i read your novel .
many times , and ...
i can' t read anything else .
it grabbed me inside and won' t let go .
but ...
i' ve also followed you .
when i see you
i like to follow behind and see where you go , in secret .
i know where you live .
it' s nearby .
and sometimes
i see you here .
do you recognize me ?
no .
i' m a waitress in that restaurant .
you' ve never come in .
my boss is fine .
he' s a good cook .
but he wants to live together , and the truth is ,
i was really glad .
because ...
i felt needed .
and i even like him .
so ...
i' ve decided ...
what ?
the person i really want to live with is you .
it' s not that you' re lonely .
i' m completely in love with you .
madly , as you can see .
you' re so brave .
yeah .
and it' s over .
i tried .
did you enjoy that ?
feel free to leave .
is there anything else you want ?
yes .
with time , living together , you' il end up falling in love with me , of course .
i think i just did .
let' s go get drunk and celebrate .
behind this door you will find my altar .
what pretty lights you have at home .
i' m so happy .
you can' t imagine .
go ahead and undress me .
forgive me , lorenzo .
i' m not used to things working out .
do whatever you want to me .
you start , okay ?
a ray of sunshine ...
brought your love to me ...
slowly .
with love .
we' re just starting .
like that .
so it lasts longer .
i' m dying , i' m dying !
my love !
i' m gonna die !
it' s delicious , lorenzo .
wait until you try the fish .
i' ve always been around good cooks .
i don' t know why .
though my boss isn' t around much anymore .
my grandmother , yes .
with her home cooking ... just for me .
i moved in with her when i was six .
she said my parents and brother had opened a newsstand in heaven in front of the angel school .
a newsstand and a bookshop .
because their stand in the village never paid much .
the three of them were killed in a car crash .
and my poor grandmother died two years ago ...
she told me the whole story in a so good way ... ... that i still believe it .
i always liked people who tell stories in their way .
i trust them .
did your mother teach you to cook ?
no .
she left my dad real quick , when i was young .
i had to cook for him .
until one day he got stabbed .
i may be a shitty cook , but i' m a great waitress .
i have a camera .
how about a striptease ?
right now , without getting up .
if you do one later .
you wouldn' t .
i' ve got just what you want .
oh , how i knew ...
i' ve got just what you want .
oh , how i knew ...
i' ve got just what you want .
it' s all been taken care of ,
i' il settle the score , remember ...
i' ve got a map ...
gorgeous . ... and i' m one nosy bitch .
i' m working on it .
i gotta do it , i don' t want to end up broke .
my feet are my ticket ...
had to be good at something ...
i' m working on it .
i' m working on it .
i' m working on it .
i' m resourceful , baby !
you turn me on , saliva , milk and stuff ...
i' m in control .
lorenzo ...
lorenzo , my love .
i can' t take anymore .
so much love will kill me .
i' m dying !
i' m dying !
don' t scream , it' s no big deal !
push .
that' s it , a little more .
here it comes .
a little more .
here it comes .
i' il get the dad .
yes , please .
you see ?
shouting makes no difference .
there' s no one there .
it' s all right , my little girl will help me find him .
have you ever ... with another girl ... had better sex ?
no .
tell me the truth .
maybe on an isolated occasion .
but it' s different .
isolated on the island , right ?
yes .
a random somebody , a total stranger , with a full moon ...
we should go to your island .
separately , and meet there ,
iike strangers .
we' d have the best sex ever .
which do you prefer ?
wild sex with a stranger ?
or sex with someone you know , someone you love , but also wild ?
what ?
you have to choose .
wild sex with a stranger , or wild sex with someone who' s crazy about you , and who you love .
go ahead .
be frank .
with you .
finally .
i' d never imagined being so lucky .
girls like you never like guys like me .
you' re a gift .
the restaurant in madrid grew famous thanks to the paellas made by the silent girl .
she still recalled her grandmother , buried back home with her parents .
when asked where she was from , she was so timid that she' d say she was from malta .
her destiny changed that night , when she ran into a real maltese .
a ray of sunshine ...
brought your love to me ...
a ray of sunshine ...
straight to my heart ...
how' s it going ?
fine .
getting used to all this clean air .
yeah .
you get used to everything here .
this island' s easy .
and you' re a pro .
of course .
you have oxygen .
i' m renting scuba equipment this summer .
i' m testing it .
you like diving ?
no , not me .
just the opposite .
sorry , but ...
i prefer open air .
open air and sunshine .
too bad .
these waters are special .
to each his own .
this really isn' t an island .
it isn' t ?
it' s a giant lid .
a floating piece of earth .
like a raft .
but it isn' t moving .
people get dizzy here during high tide .
and no one knows why .
except you .
i' ve dived underneath the whole island .
it' s totally hollow .
thousands of caves , but nothing else .
not a single rock connects it to the seafloor .
what' s your name ?
carlos .
i' m luca .
trust me , luca .
i' il show you someday .
okay .
but i' il stay up here .
right .
the girl waits on the pretty side , and the crab explores the ugly , ... ... rocky , ... ... horrible side .
do you want to see the good things ... ... on this island ?
yeah .
i want you to meet elena .
hi , i' m elena .
luca .
stay for dinner ?
okay .
you can sleep here , too .
it' s a guest house .
carlos is alone , so i have 9 rooms free .
want to see them ?
come on .
this is my room .
next to the kitchen so i can cook on line .
come on in .
no , i' m sorry .
i' m not ready to see other people up close .
i know which room .
it' s perfect for you .
come on .
i leave the second floor vacant until summer .
3, 000 a day in low season , but you can have it for 2, 000 .
plus 2, 000 if you want board .
i recommend it , i' m the best cook around .
can i skip dinner and stay tonight ?
we' il talk tomorrow .
of course .
something terrible happened and i had to run .
we' il take care of you here .
a ray of sunshine ...
straight to my heart ...
brought your love to me ...
i' d searched for so long ...
and finally it' s mine ...
i have a new guest .
she' s a fantastic singer .
so from now on , i' il cook even better .
if possible .
can i name you ?
name ?
yeah , luca .
are you writing it ?
it' s still unsent .
you can change your name if you want .
we all use nicknames .
her name' s lucla .
a ray of sunshlne .
is that okay ?
it' s great .
look .
this is for you .
sing us something , luca " .
a ray of sunshlne ...
stralght to my heart ...
welcome , luca .
nice song .
where are you ? " .
everyday further away from where i was .
i like that .
so would carlos .
for himself .
he' s been here 6 months .
i sense he' s still tied to the main land .
he' s someone who gains your trust easily .
is there anything between you ?
yeah , sex .
every now and then .
without intimacy .
i prefer it , this way i don' t get hooked .
just wild sex .
it must be the island .
yeah , but ...
carlos has the biggest dick i' ve ever seen .
how lucky .
i don' t know where he got it .
it' s enormous .
where are you ?
the abortion part .
is that a hint ?
why don' t you take a stroll ?
i am .
in the street .
you' re like an expectant father .
exactly .
and you' re the mother .
ay my love , without you i dont understand the meaning of to wake up ,
ay my love , without you my bed is wider ,
ay my love who show me the truth ,
there are loneliness and a bunch of frost between us .
it' s very positive .
there' s lots of happiness .
it' s me .
i was expecting something tragic .
like in your first novel .
i should have read it while you were writing , to get used to the idea .
i screwed up .
i' m sorry .
i' m going for a walk .
i didn' t grab your heart this time .
i guess i already have it .
remember that birthday when you were on the island ?
you sure got a great gift .
get ready , because tonight i' ve got another for you .
from me .
are you proposing ?
remember my sister ?
the one who' s a nurse ?
well , she' s become close friends with a girl whose baby she helped deliver four years ago .
a little girl .
speaking of babies ...
how' s the novel ?
all the stalling ...
what do i tell my editors ?
you always think of something .
sure , that' s why you get all your stories from me .
write this one as is .
it' s unbelievable .
why' s that ?
by the way , don' t worry ... ... about my sister , she doesn' t know it' s you .
or the mother ... ... who gave birth , i don' t even know her .
i kept you secret .
why secret ?
well , the baby girl was born here in madrid .
but she was conceived on a beach , on an island , a night like tonight , with a stranger ... from madrid .
it was his birthday .
if you write this well , it' il be the story of your life and my birthday gift to you .
i know where to find the kid .
afternoons in a square .
without the mother .
what' s her name ?
the mother ?
no , the daughter .
your daughter' s name is luna .
of course .
luna .
what' s your name ?
luna .
what' s the sun' s name ?
lorenzo .
lorenzo .
just like me .
what' s the moon' s name ?
you want the job ?
yes .
then the moon' s name is luna .
today was an important day .
you don' t know your father ? .
you' ve never seen him ?
do you know his name ?
no .
don' t worry , names don' t matter .
would you like it if ... ... i were your dad ?
could you be ?
yeah , if you want me to be .
but in secret .
my real father ?
he thought it was a very big secret for such a small little girl .
his smile faded .
then he went over and sat along side her .
do you know what happens lf someone discovers the secret ... ... between the moon and the sun ?
like mountains caving in .
maybe someday he' d find a way to tell her , so for the time being he left it at that .
what was the point of being a father ... ... if she didn' t know ?
he knew then that lf he' d told her , she' d have kept the secret .
secret .
you have a daughter ?
lorenzo , honey .
do you ?
why do you ask ?
i saw it on your computer .
and i loved it .
i can' t keep writing it .
why not ?
i don' t know what it is to be a father .
then make it up .
i' m glad you' re writing again .
i was feeling guilty .
none of it is your fault .
luna doesn' t know her dad .
she lives alone with her mom ?
no , with a dumb soccer player .
i' ve never seen my dad .
me , neither .
my mother' s an actress .
a porn actress .
i like that .
she quit last year .
she met this amazing guy who was a client , and fell for him .
now we live together .
he retired her .
sounds nice .
he' s the sweetest guy ...
he has the biggest heart ever .
and he' s handsome .
he' s really sexy .
you like him , too ?
me ?
why ?
can you tell ?
you like him a lot ?
okay , drop it .
would you do him ?
no !
he' s my mother' s lover .
poor thing , she' s in love for once .
do you think he likes you ?
if he offered , and your mom never found out ?
just once , as a test .
a test , right ?
this is between you and me .
just once ?
yeah .
why not ?
because .
i don' t know ...
i hope i never get put to the test .
but she put him to the test .
one morning when her mother was shopping , she took a shower and left the door open .
it almost happened .
what did ?
the test .
with antonio .
tell me about it .
last night , when they went to bed ,
i put one of my mom' s movies on .
it' s strange , but ...
seeing her in action gets me hot .
you masturbated .
you always guess .
i took one of her dildos from her room while they slept .
i lay naked on the sofa , in the dark , in front of the tv .
i started copying her sexual positions .
their lust almost killed them .
he covered her mouth so her mother wouldn' t wake up .
we decided not to tell my mom .
and to never do it again .
i promised antonio i' d find myself a boyfriend right away so i' d have someone to play with .
here , i' il loan you my mom for a couple days .
i masturbated because of you , but ended up thinking of him .
but we didn' t do it .
i' m not even sure i saw him .
i just felt him .
spying on me from behind .
at least i think so .
how nice !
you never greet me this way anymore .
i should get home early every night .
your mom was great .
quite an actress .
you got off ?
yes .
if only i' d seen you through a small hole in the wall .
are you beln' s boyfriend ?
would you like him to be ?
yeah , sure .
then that' s that .
i have to sleep ... ... at luna' s tonight .
her parents are going out .
i can ask if my boyfriend can come along .
she' s really cool .
what' s her name ?
elena .
well ,
i' d prefer just to see you and luna , no one else .
why the boyfriend ?
can' t they wait ?
she asked me as a special favor .
maybe they can' t .
they' il fuck .
good for them .
we don' t even know him .
and in our bed ?
you' re just like your dog .
hi , boyfriend .
the doors are open .
be nice to him or i' il have to castrate you .
you hear me ?
delicious .
you' re a great cook .
and what do you do ?
you won' t tell me ?
i' il get it out later .
i want some water .
before i met luna i thought i' d never have kids .
wouldn' t you want a daughter like her ?
of course .
to me ...
you' il always be my first .
and to you ?
the first and only .
can i watch tv ?
it' s late , go to bed .
if lorenzo tucks me in .
you' il have to show me where .
and a kiss ?
can you tell stories ?
of course , that' s my job .
did you know that island has the lowest moon ?
that' s right .
but only a few of us ... ... in the world know it .
it also has ... great weather , and it grants wishes .
if you need something , the rocks below the shore ... ... give it to you as a gift .
but watch out for the holes in the ground .
though it doesn' t matter , because ... ... no one ever dies there .
for example , if you fall , you can choose any life you want .
you can be your favorite fish .
the island was glad when the girl arrived , especially the rocks below the shore , so they decided to give her something .
but what ?
a raft .
bigger .
a dog .
no .
something she didn' t have .
her father .
bull' s eye , butterfly .
tonight you keep watch outside .
all she had to do was
iook everywhere for him until she found him .
her father could be whoever she wanted .
but then the girl had doubts , like everyone .
would she choose a lighthouse keeper daddy or a fisherman daddy ?
she knew one thing : what she really wanted ... ... was her mother to become a beautiful mermaid .
she' s asleep .
beln , i want you to know something .
i changed into this , do you mind ?
hi , it' s elena .
is beln there ?
yes .
it' s elena .
hello ?
how are you ?
better .
i' m improving .
and you ?
well , i haven' t cried .
i can' t .
i haven' t seen her .
they told me , but i don' t understand .
i don' t want to imagine it .
that' s why i came here .
to be closer to her by swimming in the sea .
cry , beln .
now that you can .
it helps me to hear you cry .
that' s lt .
cry .
cry .
you need to cry .
she hears you , too .
a big kiss from the sea ... from both of us .
lately you' re always in bed .
you know what time it is ?
it' s a beautiful day .
sunny and clear .
and it' s my day off .
get up , lazybones !
do you need all ... ... these pills just to sleep ?
you never had problems sleeping before .
lorenzo , honey .
i' m worried about you .
you' ve been depressed for days .
trouble with the novel ?
is that it ?
you look terrible .
something' s happened .
what ?
you' re sweating .
i' ve left , and there' s no coming back .
your life ... ... is more important than your novel .
than any novel .
writing is vital to you , but you need to take care of yourself .
you' re too good a person to see the shit i have inside .
stop , that' s enough .
i have a confession .
so you see how close i am .
i' ve been reading the novel .
everything you' ve written .
at night , when you' re asleep .
do you mind ?
i understand why you' re so affected , why you reject it , and why it' s hard for you to go on .
it can' t be easy , living there , in that house , with that stormy relationship .
so much repressed desire , impossible to control .
he' s coming between a mother and her daughter , breaking a sacred bond .
but the passion' s there , too .
the promptings of the blood bombing .
i identify with her .
i understand exactly how she feels .
disgusted , guilty , selfish ...
her mom' s jealousy ...
but she' s forced to choose ... ... between passionate love for a man , and love for a mother .
i' d have chosen the same .
such decisions are made by gut instinct .
sex ...
the thick , burning lust filled the mother , the man and the daughter .
they were sex crazed .
the stench of raw sex ...
the mother and the man ,
the man and the daughter , the daughter and the man .
all the man' s poisoned love ...
alone with the daughter , the daughter and the man ...
the smell was ... heavy , hot , overwhelming ...
stuffy ...
stale air .
exhausted ...
the paint fell from the corners of the room ... ... and the walls became rocky ,
iike those in a cave .
a filthy den of ...
get out !
relax .
just wanted to let you know that i' m here .
the man was selfish , a coward .
he hated himself so deeply , so utterly , there wasn' t even ... ... time for forgiveness .
only time for death .
death , death , death , death .
beln' s fine .
she' s home with her family .
forget the whole thing .
you' ve suffered enough .
will i ever read the novel ?
of course .
another thing .
tell me about elena , too .
my sister writes to her on line .
she' s on that mediterranean cooking chat everyday .
her nick is " alsi " .
" alsi " ?
a l s i.
that' s spanish for " island " backwards .
hi , alsi .
how are you ?
i don' t know you .
it' s better that way .
i' m here to help .
what' s your nick ?
i don' t understand the icon .
it' s a lighthouse for your island .
are you the keeper ?
yeah .
i have a story for you , it' s full of advantages .
i' d like that .
thanks .
the first advantage is at the end of the story .
it doesn' t finish , it falls in a hole .
and the story starts again halfway .
the other advantage , and the biggest ,
is that you can change course along the way ...
if you let me .
if you give me time .
all the time you want .
go on , please .
to be continued .
what happened ?
why are you so late ?
my boss invited me to dinner .
he wanted me to try a new dish .
did you screw him ?
what ?
did you go to bed with him ?
that' s right , you guessed it .
and how was it ?
tell me about it .
no .
you first .
what' s going on ?
what' s your problem ?
i lost track of you ages ago .
you' re not alive !
was it the first time with him ?
the second .
the first was before we met .
or should i say before i proposed ?
so it doesn' t count .
you could have told me before .
yeah , i could have .
and today ?
well ...
it doesn' t count , either .
it' s a lie .
but we came close .
how close ?
did you stop or did he ?
what about you stopping with me ?
lorenzo , do you love me ?
i need to hear you say it right now .
yes .
deeply .
more than myself .
but i' m lost .
then let me help you .
you don' t deserve this .
why not ?
i' m your girlfriend , and i love you more than myself .
come on , it' s obvious .
you' re draining my life away .
i' m doing all i can to get back , and accept myself , but if i can' t , don' t wait for me .
i wouldn' t , either .
what happened to you ?
beln , it' s elena .
how are you ?
it' s real hot here .
why don' t you come out ?
the sea will do you good .
i have a guesthouse for the whole summer .
i' il have a room free in august .
upstairs .
my best room .
you' il watch the sunset ... ... from your bed .
bring someone if you want .
well ?
the truth is , i' d love to visit an island ... with someone .
then that' s it .
it' s difficult , elena .
dlfficult ?
nothing is here .
all the bad' s left behind .
just bring along the good .
right .
the good up front .
i really want to see you , but here .
i don' t want to lose touch .
say you' il come .
promise me .
i promise
i' il try .
good bye .
forgive me , luca .
i' ve got to end this .
i' m going to kill them for once and for all .
both of them .
right now .
if you' ve stopped being a writer , you have to ... ... explain why .
you' re holding back .
if you don' t tell me ,
i' il never forgive you !
you hear me ?
never !
i can' t talk like this .
talk ?
you' re the one who won' t talk .
you keep it all inside .
you won' t let me help you .
everything' s you .
i' m crumpled up in the corner .
look .
you were meant to live alone , and to suffer alone .
and to poison yourself with your fucking doubts , which i don' t understand .
you' re sick , lorenzo .
sick of yourself , of your own standards , and nothing else .
of your fucking secrets !
you keep me around , but in the dark .
because my complaints don' t count .
because you don' t give a fuck what happens to me .
your troubles are so deep ,
i' m fucking stupid , and all you care about is if i screw my boss or not .
i' m exhausted .
you' re driving me nuts .
i' il be late to work .
enjoy your hole .
have fun rotting by yourself .
look , i' ve never been this mean to anyone .
it' s the last time i' il let myself talk like this .
it' s for me , not you .
that' s right .
it' s time to think of myself , of my own needs .
because i see no future with you .
luca !
come over here and lie next to me .
relax , luca .
let the mud absorb all the bad .
later it' il wash away in the sea .
i don' t want sex .
i' m not ready yet .
don' t worry .
we' il just lie here , drying out in the sun .
yeah , he looks like carlos .
missing for 6 months " .
manuela and beln lozano , mother and daughter , and antonio castillo , were all living together .
if anyone knows where they are , please contact the police .
the police ?
we' il ... act like we didn' t see this ,
iike nothing' s happened .
we know he lived with two women .
mother and daughter .
yeah , and the daughter ...
what ?
the daughter was taking care of ... my daughter .
they left without him , quietly , without saying goodbye .
as he slept ,
like in a dream .
when he woke , he felt the two lifeless women ... .. were still with him ,
like any morning at that hour .
and he lay still , wishing his life would also ... ... leave him , through his blood .
what good was his blood now ?
he wished it softly , wlthout real intent .
and he chose to escape , to start over , to be new .
to change his whole blood .
so he said goodbye and left .
we should give him a chance .
don' t we all deserve one ?
just in case , if in doubt , isn' t it better to trust people ?
right ?
so when he gets back , we' il ask him to explain .
it' s better this way .
especially for you .
for me ?
i just want to forget .
you can' t forget some things .
in this house you can .
that' s why we' re here .
then it' s too late .
i should have come before .
when there was time ...
for lorenzo .
i wanted him to show me the island .
i asked him to , but he wouldn' t .
it would have been his birthday soon .
what day ?
the 23rd .
of may ?
we could have celebrated here on the island .
maybe even with you .
who knows if we' d have met , right ?
right .
when was lorenzo here ?
a long time ago .
before we met .
how long ago ?
about six years ago .
yeah .
i think he turned 25 here .
luca ...
what is it ?
i' m overwhelmed ...
but i can' t cry .
don' t worry .
you don' t have to .
i' m the one who should cry over him .
i' il just faint , then .
it' s the sea .
must be high tide .
i' il never cry again .
i' m going to bed .
what' s going on ?
luna , spring of 1988 " .
luna .
why bother being a father if she didn' t know ?
he knew then that lf he' d told her , she' d have kept the secret .
luca , never talk to me about this .
i don' t want to hear it .
well , i do .
he' s out diving .
beneath the island .
do you like carlos ?
i don' t anymore .
go ahead , he' s all yours .
i won' t even be jealous .
what are you doing ?
asking a friend for advice .
i don' t know him , but i' m getting to like him .
he' s been writing me since i got here .
he made up ... ... a sweet story to help me .
he taught me to forget .
and to escape pain .
want to read it ?
you could get into it .
it' s full of advantages .
because in the end ... there' s a hole to escape through .
back to the middle .
to change course , if you want .
that' s his icon , it' s a lighthouse .
but it has no keeper , it must be a computer .
maybe his .
you' il meet my daughter .
i can' t read this .
why not ?
it will grab me .
and won' t let go .
that' s good .
did you finally do it ?
do what ?
change course ?
not all the way , there wasn' t time .
that' s why i' m writing him .
where' s the keeper ?
don' t write him .
there' s nothing more the poor man can do .
has he written you since i first got here ?
hi , lorenzo .
how are you ?
your face says it all .
they called to say you were more awake .
do you know who i am ?
pepe .
thank god .
glad to have you back .
you' il be writing in no time .
where' s luca ?
it says here that ... .. your craneal hematoma has subsided .
and the rest of your bruises are history .
where' s luca ?
you were in bad shape .
we didn' t think you' d make it .
how long have i been here ?
well ...
one week in a coma , with this horrible respirator ...
and two more weeks breathing on your own , but unconscious .
and in this room since four or five days ago , blabbering in your sleep .
and when you' d wake up , you were out of it .
we haven' t heard from luca .
i looked everywhere .
she hasn' t been to your place , nor the restaurant , since the night of your accident .
lorenzo .
i think luca believes you' re dead .
that' s why she left .
i talked to the ambulance guy .
he said a cop called your house and talked to her .
he mentioned the car ... ... and she hung up .
he tried to call back but she wouldn' t answer .
i need to pee .
do it there ,
in the pan .
no way !
wait , wait .
thanks , pepe , but i can manage .
lose the attitude .
i' ve helped you all week .
you just don' t remember .
i know where she might be .
you came by car ?
as soon as they called .
good morning .
tell me right now why you' re here and beln isn' t .
you see ?
i don' t want to forget anymore .
thanks to you , honey .
well ?
won' t you answer me ?
it' s time to show you who i really am , no more stories .
were you there with beln , in my room , ...
... when that fucking dog killed my daughter ?
it wasn' t me .
it wasn' t ?
then why are the cops looking for you ?
beln was with some guy who met her in the park with your daughter .
but he disappeared after that night .
what about beln ?
where is she ?
since you know everything .
she left with her mom but didn' t tell me where .
she changed in the end , and chose her mom over me .
can' t blame her .
a mother always comes first .
i don' t trust you anymore , antonio ...
i won' t ask you any more questions .
i' il leave that to the police .
lying to them won' t be so easy .
look how brave i got all of a sudden .
wait .
please don' t call the police .
why not ?
are you holding back anything else ?
i' ve no one left ... ... who i can trust .
where are you going ?
making a get away ?
they' il track you down !
if you call the cops ,
i' il leave , too .
are you stupid ?
yes .
where are you going ?
i don' t understand .
i trust carlos , and i believe him .
i want to know more .
that' s the easy part .
believing what you want .
what pleases you .
i did that , too .
until tonight .
i' il chase whom ever i please !
men matter less and less to me .
that' s my lot .
they' ve never given me anything .
except sex .
no ?
what about the keeper ?
what ?
besides wild sex and a daughter ?
don' t forget that story full of advantages that he wrote just for you !
that' s right .
maybe your boyfriend was the last
good man on earth .
no , he wasn' t .
you' re wrong , but that' s my business .
and i suppose carlos is also your business .
yours alone .
you' re the only one chasing him .
yeah .
come to think of it ,
i always chase men .
when i like them .
to each his own , right ?
where could he be ?
i don' t know .
i' m going home .
you guys cook tonight .
i' m so sorry .
carlos !
it' s me , luca .
i want to come down .
come and help me .
i know how to dive , too .
what did you think ?
luca .
it' s me , elena .
where' s carlos ?
down there .
did he escape ?
maybe he' s dead .
if he turns up , we have to believe him , okay ?
whatever you want .
that' s right .
he' s a crab .
let' s go home .
what for ?
to eat .
so early ?
i' m not hungry .
tough .
it' s about time you helped me cook .
we' il make a special meal and we' il be together and have fun .
you' re a gift to this earth .
elena .
you' re crying .
tears of happiness , which is what i am from now on .
great .
i hope it' s contagious .
piece of cake .
let' s go .
the first advantage ls at the end of the story .
it doesn' t finish ,
it falls ln a hole .
and the story starts again halfway .
the other advantage , and the biggest ,
is that you can change course along the way ...
if you let me .
if you give me time .
a ray of sunshine ...
