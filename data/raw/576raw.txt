face it .
inspector g ... since we locked up claw , all the bad guys have been ... too afraid to show their faces in riverton .
one thing i' ve learned in all my years ... of crime fighting , gadgetmobile ... is that it' s always the most quiet ... right before the criminals strike ! .
and speaking of crime ...
potential law breaker at 12 : 00 !

i' il let you in on a little secret .
soon , we' il be unveiling something ... soon that' il solve all these glitches for good soon .
wowsers .
thanks , baxter .
well , better go check in with the chief .
i wouldn' t bother the chief right now .
i heard some idiot arrested his mother this afternoon .
where is he ? !
gadget !
oh ...
you put my mother in jail for drag racing ?
and driving without a license .
you' ve always said , chief , no one is above the law .
this is what you said last week when you arrested ... that troop of girl rangers for selling cookies !
those cookies were three days past expiration date !
what ugh .
you are this close to being put on probation , gadget .
now , let' s get my mother out .
heaven knows what' s happening to her ... down there with all those lowlifes .
when his guard is down , his kidneys are exposed ... and that' s when the marathon of pain begins .
oh !
who' s your grandma now ?
take some of this !
how' d you like this ?
wowsers , that' s gotta hurt .
mom' s tough love .
this is your last warning , gadget .
stick to solving real crimes .
chief , there are no real criminals left .
they' re all in riverton prison .
gadget here .
what ?
wowsers !
you' il never guess what happened .
claw escaped !
claw escaped ?
police have put out an all points bulletin ... and are setting up a dragnet ... in hopes of finding the fugitive .
citizens are advised that if they see ... an evil genius with a claw . not to approach him .
dial 91 1 immediately .
he' s extremely dangerous and really . really mean .
and i' m on the case .
bye bye , penny !
wait , uncle gadget !
let me come with you .
i can help look for clues
i told you before , penny , you' re too young .
how old do you have to be to be a detective ?
i don' t know .
but older than you are now .
look ...
i' ve got work to do .
i' il see you tomorrow .
don' t forget to brush your teeth .
i could do so well ... if he would just give me a chance .
my finely honed instincts are telling me ... that he probably escaped through here .
oh , really ?
gadget , take a look at this .
we found this in claw' s cell .
wowsers .
you don' t think he' s still holding a grudge ?
gadget , listen .
the whole city is counting on you .
go out there and catch claw .
oh , i' il catch him .
caught him before , catch him again .
don' t you worry , chief .
i' il have claw back behind bars before you can say
gadget ooh !
brick . retrieve my darts !
huh ?
ooh !
mckible . serve my tea !
i don' t see why we gotta ... retrieve your darts and serve your tea .
yeah !
we' re vicious minions , not valets .
aah !
oh !
heh heh heh .
one sugar or two ?
two .
here , boss .
dr. claw , this place is a dump .
what happened to your multimillion dollar ... high rise evil headquarters ?
what do you think happened to it ?
aah !
when gadget arrested me ... the police confiscated all my assets .
but after we' ve pulled off the crime of the century ...
i' il be back on top again .
great another crime of the century .
i' m still on parole for the last one .
what' s the plan this time ?
watch and see .
the federal reserve bank ... with a deposit of over five trillion dollars ... in pure gold . was built two years ago ... after riverton was declared statistically ... the safest city in america .
utilizing the latest in security technology ... and a squadron of armed guards ... the bank is considered impregnable .
not for long .
we' re gonna rob the federal reserve !
right before riverton' s eyes ... and there won' t be a thing gadget can do about it .
how we gonna do that ?
they said the bank was impen
really hard to get into .
yeah , i don' t see how .
that' s why you' re minions , and i' m an evil genius .
he' s got a point .
yeah .
we are going to build the ultimate super weapon .
but we haven' t much time .
23 a. m ... the x force one satellite will be directly over riverton .
and by then . we need to steal ... ion fuel cells . a protoid laser ... and a ruby ... plus a few miscellaneous knickknacks .
yum .
i love knickknacks .
any news on claw' s escape ?
the city' s in a panic !
the people want to know .
what are you doing to capture claw ?
ladies and gentlemen , this is a momentous day .
huh ?
the gadget pr . ogr . am has helped make riverton ...
thanks a lot .
hmph ! ... the safest city in america !
bob !
thank you , mayor .
we weren' t going to unveil this until next year ... but in light of claw' s escape ... we decided to move up our timetable .
baxter ..
this is gadget model 2 ... or " g2 " for short .
the latest . most newest gener . ation ... in the gadget program .
g2 reporting for duty .
sir !
wowsers .
she' s similar to the original gadget ... but she' s completely , entirely all robot .
not to worry , g2 ...
i' ve got everything under control .
oh , lnspector , you' re everything ...
i ever wanted in a crime fighter .
gadget .
gadget !
gadget , could you give me a hand , please ?
certainly , chief .
i want to give a little demonstration of what g2 can do .
pleasure to meet you , miss ... 2 .
g2
must be a loose wire or something .
i' il speak to baxter about that .
g2 will now show us how she would apprehend the suspect .
gadget , i want you to take this stolen money ... and hide it on your person .
stolen money !
stop this felonious and unlawful act ... or i shall have to use force .
well , she has got a very commanding voice .
alert . suspect . suspect .
very well .
you were warned .
you have the right to remain silent .
if you give up this right , anything you say ... can and will be held against you .
all right , g2 , i think we get the picture .
bravo !
bravo !
thank you .
iadies and gentlemen
she is very good .
i noticed that she didn' t say " go , go , gadget .
that' s one of the many improvements i' ve made to g2 . 0 .
like it ?
you might say that g2 is you without the glitches .
i' m putting her on the claw case right away .
fantastic .
i always wanted a partner .
and when we interrogate criminals ...
i' il play good gadget , and you can play bad gadget .
i don' t think so .
ok , then you play good gadget , and i' il be bad gadget .
i appreciate the offer , lnspector ... but i work alone .
but , chief , the claw case is my case .
you can go back to cracking speeders on the highway .
there' s a new sheriff in town .
hmm ?
uncle gadget ?
is this tr . ue ?
uncle gadget ?
is this tr . ue ?
they' re giving the claw case to this g2 character ?
for the time being , but don' t worry , penny ...
i' m being reassigned to another high profile case .
what could be more high profile than claw ?
it' s top secret , penny .
so top secret that they haven' t even told me yet .
hmm .
so , what are you making ?
i' m just making your favorite dessert .
apple crumb cake with raisin cinnamon icing ... and coconut sprinkles ?
ok , i' m making your second favorite dessert ...
iemon pudding .
so , since you' re off the case ... you wouldn' t want to see this clue i found about claw .
clue claw ?
i mean , a claw clue ?
is it a clue about claw ?
take a look at today' s classifieds .
wanted " ...
apply 7 p ; m. tonight .
call 555 01 39 for appointment .
i' ve already got a job , penny , but thanks .
no , i checked the number ... and it' s for a bar called " the blue monkey .
you know what this means ?
uncle gadget , if you go to the blue monkey ...
i bet it will lead you right to claw .
you can get back on the case and get a jump on g2 .
you know , penny , if i went to the blue monkey ... it might just lead me to claw .
then i could get back on the case and get the jump on g2 .
that' s what i was just saying .
did you ?
i guess great minds think alike .
so , we' il leave right after dinner ?
no .
nope .
i' m sorry , penny ... but this is official police business only .
you gotta let me come with you .
i can help you .
penny , this is no place for a kid .
i' m not just a kid , uncle gadget .
of course not .
you' re a very special kid .
but there' s more to being a detective than being smart .
it takes a sharp eye ... for every detail , every little nuance .
a good detective never lets anything get
uncle gadget , the pudding !

thanks for the backup , g2 ... although everything was under control .
i had those toughs right where i wanted them .
inspector , what were you doing in that bar dressed as ...

i' m a hooligan .
huh ?
i went undercover to follow up on a valuable lead ... concerning where' s clawabouts
i mean , claw' s whereabouts .
i' m in charge of the claw investigation , remember ?
maybe we got off on the wrong foot .
ooh !
oh .
perhaps we could have dinner sometime just to discuss crime fighting strategies .
imagine how great we could be as a team .
we could call ourselves " the g force " ... or " the g team " or " the 2 gs " .
lnspector gadget .
what up , g ?
even though i' m not programmed for such emotions ...
i admit i find you strangely ... iikable .
hmm .
but as i already told you , i work alone .
and so do l .
i' m just saying that maybe we could work alone together .
you don' t even know who i am .
think about it .
no , really .
you can' t arrest me .
i' m one of the good guys .
really , i am .
hold on .
she' s with me .
what are you doing here ?
didn' t i tell you to stay home ?
never mind that .
look what i found about claw .
dr. claw' s pulling a little heist tomorrow night ... at the concentrated lndustries warehouse .
wowsers !
we' il have to have a stakeout .
you mean , i' il have to have a stakeout .
this is our case , lady .
penny .

claw clues clue about claw .
and i was right .

fantastic .
i' il bring the doughnuts .
i already told you .
you' re off this case .
both you and nancy drew here .
hey !
pbbt !
and you' re off the force , too , if you get within ... as a hundred yards of that stakeout .
fine , but if claw gets away with his plan ... for world domination , don' t come crying to us .
remember , gadget 100 yards !
99 , 100 ... 101 yards away .
i' m at the stakeout ... but i haven' t violated the chief' s orders .
see ?
at the stakeout ... not at the stakeout .
stakeout ... not at the stakeout .
i don' t think the chief will see it that way .
go , go , gadget binoculars .
she certainly is well equipped , isn' t she ?
ooh , gadget' s got a girlfriend .
don' t be silly , gadgetmobile .
our relationship is strictly professional .
besides , she' s state of the art .
i' m last year' s model .
a few extr . a miles look good on a player .... and you are a player , g.
you' re tricked out with more extras than the batmobile .
just show her that it' s all good under the hood .
i have no idea what you just said ... but i' m sure that if i were a car ... it would have been very helpful .
all i' m saying is , you got to show her ... you got what it takes , man .
you' re right .
you' re right !
thanks , gadgetmobile .
i' m just gonna go up to the roof ... and scope out the situation .
you go ahead on with your bad self ha !

you were warned .
gadget to the rescue !
ooh unh !

well , it looked like you could use some help .
quick , grab the fuel cells !
let' s get out of here !
they' re getting away .
not to worry , g2 .
i' il get us out of this .
go , go , gadget scissors .
gadget !
i told you specifically not to go to the stakeout .
i told you specifically not to go to the stakeout .
that' s not entirely accurate , chief .
you told me not to get within 100 yards of the stakeout ... and i posted myself exactly 101 yards away .
then how did you get tangled up with me inside the warehouse ?
you gave me backup at the bar ..
i thought i' d give you backup at the warehouse .
i never need backup .
until we find out what claw needs the fuel cells for ... all of riverton is at risk .
chief , you have to put me back on the case .
the department needs me !
that' s right , gadget .
the department does need you .
and i' ve got just the assignment ... to take advantage of your unique abilities .
go , go , gadget power brush .
come on , come on .
i' m stuck .
go , go , gadget turbo speed .
go , go , gadget stop !
stop !
be careful in there .
that toilet' s got quite a flush .
looks like gadget has finally found his true calling
roto rooter man .
ha ha ha !
hey , dr. claw , check this out an unlimited supply of bowling shirts .
and shoes !
silence !
everyone , pay attention !
who can tell me what we need next ... to build my super weapon ?
the laser . !
a new exper . imental pr . otoid laser .... that' s being unveiled at the riverton science convention .
but to take it , we need a little diversion .
hey , uncle gadget .
penny , shouldn' t you be in school ?
uncle gadget , school was over an hour ago .
oh .
i' m sorry , penny .
oh . hey !
this came for you in the mail today .
looks kind of strange .
lnspector gadget ...
wowsers !
he must have really bad handwriting ... to go to all that trouble .
or maybe he doesn' t want you to identify his handwriting .
look , it' s signed " anonymous concerned citizen .
it' s good to know we still have a concerned citizen ... who' s willing to get involved .
this smells like claw .
no .
why would claw want me there ?
i don' t know .
uncle gadget , this might be a trap .
penny , i' m thinking that this might be a trap .
that' s what i just said .
you gotta let me come with you this time .
sorry , penny .
no can do .
this is work for a serious law enforcement professional .
you mean like a bathroom attendant ?
exactly .
don' t stay up for me , penny .
i' m on the case .
i need you to keep a sharp eye out , gadgetmobile .
if you see anything suspicious , you let me know .
like a trekkie with a girlfriend ?

the goose has arrived ready to be cooked .
ther . e we go .
how' s that ?

they stiffed me again .
i live on tips !
brain , take a look at this .
fuel cells .
that' s what claw stole from the warehouse .

what would claw want with a ruby ?
claw' s definitely up to something big .
wait a minute .
i know what claw' s up to .
he' s going to build
come on , brain .
we' re rich !
hey , hey !
how much do you think this thing would fetch on ebay ?
about $1 . 98 .
no , nitwits .
once we' ve robbed the federal reserve ... we can buy hundr . eds of these baubles .
with my secret weapon , riverton will be defenseless as will the rest of the world !
i' ve got to tell uncle gadget .

g2 will be
g2 is finished ... along with the whole gadget program .
it' s time we reinvested ... in some good old fashioned policemen and women ... not these mechanical clowns .
ms. mayor , if you just give me another chance
you had your chance .
it' s bad enough they stole the ruby ... but what' s worse ... no one gave any money to my campaign .
i should' ve learned my lesson with gadget .
this whole program is a total waste of time .
come on , g2 .
we' re taking you to the precinct for immediate deactivation .
deactivation ?
that' s right .
deactivation .

or is there ?
ok .
where' s that light switch ?
wrong switch .
what happened ?
i reactivated you .
inspector gadget , why would you do that ?
i hate to see a good detective get recycled ... and i' ve always had great admiration ... for your investigative abilities and physical prowess ... your commanding voice .
inspector , are you saying you like me ?
well , i suppose .
in a manner of speaking .
strictly professional .
huh ?
thank you .
you' re welcome .
brain , what are you doing here ?

penny was right .
i should' ve listened to her .
she tried to tell me , and i didn' t listen to her .
speaking of listening ...
i' m getting a little tired of liver flavored kibble .
would it kill you to shell out for a pork roast or prime rib ?
look , g2 , my niece is in trouble .

i would like to award lnspectors gadget and g2 ... these distinguished conduct medals ... for their service to this city .
yay !
congratulations , gadget .
i' d like to announce that we are going to double ... the gadget unit' s budget for next year ... so that if claw ever shows his face in riverton again ... we' il be ready for him .
excuse me , chief .
if i could just possibly ...
even just for a second .
the real secret to our success has always been teamwork ... but there' s one member of our team ... who hasn' t been acknowledged yet .
and so , for providing key support ... to members of the gadget team ...
i would like to award this junior lnspector medal ... to penny for her meritorious conduct .
i couldn' t have done it without you , penny .
you are one special kid ... and i' m proud to have you as a partner .

inspector .
i wanted to say i may have been a bit premature ... in my early evaluation of your abilities .

i was wrong to think of you as inept , clumsy , imbecilic ...
don' t mention it .
obsolete , simple minded , malfunctioning
yes , yes .
