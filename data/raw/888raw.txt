ally , can we get a recap ?
you remember the kowolskis .
they' ve owned this shop for 30 years , and they are attempting to set a record ... by making buffalo' s largest cookie , and you have to wear this .
a hair net ?
health department .
you' re kidding me .
if you' re around the cookie , you have to have it on .
it' s the law .
i just did the hair .
the hair is perfect .
all right .
give it to me .
god , why do you hate me ?
we' re rolling .
and speed .
for three decades , the kowolski family bakery ... has been a mainstay in downtown buffalo ... known for their sinfully sweet , cream filled polski pierogis ... and the occasional sugar induced coma that follows .
but today , in honor of their 30th anniversary , they' ve invited us to ride along as they go for the record ... on buffalo' s biggest cookie .
vol .
vol .
you need a tissue or something ?
can we get vol a tissue or a spoon ?
it' s a good thing we' re wearing these today , ' cause i wouldn' t want any stray hairs ... to fall into the booger .
are we gonna do this again ?
no .
we can cut to b roll .
moving on !
so tell me , mama .
why make buffalo' s biggest cookie ?
well , man from health department ... say he find rat pellet in our pastry , but i say , " no .
is big chocolate sprinkle .
but he shut store down .
so we clean up , make big cookie ... for to bring customers back .
well , i admire your candor .
let' s try that again , shall we ?
so tell me , mama .
why make buffalo' s biggest cookie ?
so the children of the neighborhood will be happy ?
that' s right .
it must be wonderful seeing the smiles on their little faces .
i work in back .
i see no smiles .
the previous buffalo record was eight feet , seven inches , baked by gladys pelsnick .
if this cookie beats gladys' s , it will prove once and for all ... that the kowolskis have much more free time .
and the cookie is 10 feet , four inches .
we have a new record !
cue the cheesy inspirational music !
but what are we really looking at here ?
is it just a big cookie , or does this cookie represent the pride of buffalo , its dedicated and hardworking citizens the key ingredient ... with a few nuts thrown in ... and , finally , the love of our families , which provides the warm , chewy center , making our beloved buffalo the sweetest place to live .
and that' s the way the cookie crumbles .
i' m bruce nolan , eyewitness news .
and cut it .
what do you think ?
i think it' s really good .
it sucks .
it' s a story about a cookie .
the pillsbury doughboy will be riveted .
ohh .
honey , it was funny .
it made me laugh .
there' s nothing wrong with makin ' people laugh .
i' il never be an anchorman , not with this .
the job' s right there , but i can' t reach it , because every time they make me do this stuff ,
i have to act like a total goof in order to make it work .
i have no credibility .
not good .
not good .
you know what ?
now you' re just sounding silly .
know what ?
forget it .
it' s not important , right ?
it' s not important .
let' s watch it one more time .
oh , no .
just once more .
please ?
no .
no .
bruce , you promised you would help with this album .
now , you get your goofy butt over here .
uh uh .
okay .
okay .
okay .
now , you just go through this stack , and you pick your favorites .
oh , come on .
this is fun .
right ?
isn' t this fun ?
this is nice .
evan' s gonna get that anchor job ; i just know it .
ah , bruce !
he' s the favorite .
all right .
you know what ?
just forget it .
let' s just forget it .
this is just our life .
we can always just have some kid do it for us .
whoa !
hold the phone !
i like this one .
our weekend at the lake .
how did you get that ?
that' s supposed to be in our private stash .
you look perky , hon .
it must' ve been cold .
all right .
just give it to me .
i think i' il put this on my computer and use it as wallpaper .
no , no , no .
okay .
give it to me .
come on !
no , no , no .
all right .
fine .
do with it what you will .
i don' t care .
i will do with it what i will .
jesus .
you know , i might even send this in to playboy .
i hear their layouts can be quite tasteful .
give that to me right now !
jesus .
right now !
ow !
rough stuff !
i' m gonna hurt you ...
sweetie ?
time to get up .
uh uh .
good dream .
no .
uh uh .
no .
well , the buffalo sabres lost again last night ... at the hands of the toronto maple leafs .
it was a shootout on the ice for our hometown ...
of course .
they' re my team .
and that' s the way the cookie crumbles .
you know , i think there might be something ... to this cookie line .
all the greatest anchors have had their own signature sign off ,
like wal ter cron kite .
and that' s the way it was .
that' s the way the cookie crumbles .
and that' s the way , uh huh , uh huh , i like it , uh huh , uh huh .
oh , no .
grace , the dog !
i' m in the shower !
no , sam !
bad dog !
inside , bad .
outside , good .
inside , bad .
outside , good .
oh , you' re done now .

come on .
let' s go back inside and have a shit .
what is the deal io ? we are having a blood drive .
creepy .
needles .
yuck .
well , they need my blood .
i have a very rare blood type .
i' m a. b. positive .
really ?
mm hmm .
i' m i. b. positive .
i be positive they ain' t touchin ' me with no needle .
it' s just so ...
helpful and lifesaving ?
no .
it' s your blood .
it' s blood .
blood' s supposed to stay inside the body .
that' s where it' s meant to be .
besides , they stockpile this stuff in a warehouse somewhere .
it' s all frozen on ice , and they tell everybody there' s a shortage .
that' s just not true .
where did you hear that ?
from a very reliable friend of a friend of a girl ... whose sister' s going out with someone very high up in the government .
but for your own protection , i cannot discuss it at this time .
now , get out before they see us .
oh , no .
oh .
here .
hold on a second .
you need these more than i do .
what is these ?
prayer beads .
the kids made ' em for me .
they will keep you safe .
i hope they' re powerful .
i' m gonna need a friggin ' miracle to get to work on time .
this isn' t happening .
not now .
not during sweeps week .
not during sweeps week !
oh , god .
yeah .
yeah .
meeting' s started without me .
this is my luck .
this is my luck !

and evan is lovin ' it , by the way .
lovin ' it .
he gets the stories .

maybe i should be more like evan .
you don' t wanna be like evan .
evan' s an asshole .
i can be an asshole .

i got sweeps , and i' m live .
you know what that means ?
they' re seein ' if i can think on my feet , you know , like i might have to do in a live news anchor situation .
oh , my gosh .
yeah .
it' s what we' ve always talked about , grace .
jack practically came out and told me .
practically ?
well , he didn' t spell it out , but legally , he can' t .
but this is exactly what happened to susan ortega just before they bumped her up .
it' s good .
it' s good .
it' s good .
okay .
well , honey , i just don' t ...
i don' t want you to get too ahead of yourself .
bruce ?
oh , i gotta go .

i love you .
love , love , love , love , love .
let' s do it .

you know what ?
nothin ' can bother me today .

okay .

it' s their 156th year anniversary .

ninety seconds !
ninety seconds ?
holy hell .
uh , yeah .
okay .
ninety seconds ?
whoo .
because of the fast response , the toxic chemicals were cleaned up without incident .
susan ?
bruce nolan is standing by at niagara falls , but before we go live to bruce , we have an announcement to make .
as everyone knows , after 33 years , our beloved pete fineman is retiring .
pete' s shoes are virtually impossible to fill ,
but the show must go on , and we could think of no one better ... than our very own evan baxter .
ohh ...
oh , boy .
congratulations , evan .
thanks , susan .
i' m thrilled and honored .
and as you said , no one can replace the great pete fineman , but i will do my best .
i have to say , i am so proud to be a part of our local community of buffalo , and i think , in a lot of ways , a great city is like a great recipe , really .
you take hardworking citizens , add some caregivers , maybe a few nuts ,
all sprinkled with the love and support of good families .
ultimately , that makes one sweet place to live .
that was amazing .
i meant it .
i wish i' d written something .
and now let' s go live ... to that wacky bruce nolan out at niagara falls .
hey !
wacky bruce !
bruce ?
talk , bruce .
hello ?
talk , honey .
talk .
what' s going on ?
we got a walt disney .
he' s frozen solid .
we may not have audio .
check .
we may be having a bit of technical difficulty .
feed' s good , jack .
move .
come on .
come on .
come on .
talk , bruce , damn it !
all right .
get ready to pull the plug .
come on , baby .
say something .
say something .
bruce , talk .
hi , susan .
oh , thank you , god .
bruce nolan here aboard the maid of the mist in fabulous niagara falls .
first off , let me just add another congratulations to evan backstabber ...
pardon me .
bastard .
baxter , rather .
it is good to see what someone with talent can do ... when great opportunities are given to them instead of me .
anyway , i' m here with katharine hepburn' s mom .
tell me .
why did you throw the blue heart of the ocean jewel over the railing of the titanic ?
did you feel bad at all letting leo dicaprio drown while you were safe , floating on the door ?
could you have taken turns , or were you just too afraid to freeze your big , fat ass off ?
hmm .
i guess that' s how life is , isn' t it ?
some people are drenched , freezing to death on a stupid boat ... with a stupid hat , while others are in a comfy news studio , suckin ' up all the glory .
oh , well .
no big deal .
oh , boy .
oh , look .
it' s the owner of the maid of the mist .
let' s have a talk with him , shall we ?
come on in here , bill .
that' s all right .
no , no , no , no .
no , no .
come on .
let' s have a talk .
come on .
what are you doing ?
bill , you' ve been running the maid of the mist for 23 years now .
tell me .
why do you think i didn' t get the anchor job ?
hey , man .
i don' t want problems .
is it my hair , bill ?
are my teeth not white enough ?
or like the great falls , is the bedrock of my life ... eroding beneath me ?
eroding !
eroding !
eroding !
cut the feed .
go to black .
go to black .
i' m on it .
i' m bruce nolan for eyewitness news .
back to you , fuckers !
oh , boy .
oh , my god .
that is perfect .
that is the motivation that i needed !
right there !
thank you .
thank you , w. k. b. w !
wimpy kitty baby whiners !
that' s what that stands for !
i' il see you on channel 5 , where they do the real news .
do i look blind to you ?
do i look blind to you ?
hey .
let' s go , man .
come on .
let' s go .
what are you doing over there ?
come on .
leave the poor guy alone .
you okay , man ?
yeah , you' d better keep walkin ' .
what ?
what' d you say , ese ?
run , man !
run !
oh , god !
okay , okay , okay !
i didn' t mean it !
i was just kiddin ' !
hey , you forgot your things .
say somethin ' to that .
say somethin ' .
b e a ... utiful .
that' s what i get ...
that' s what i get for trying to help someone .
oh , don' t look at me , walter .
oh , no !
well , that' s my payment , i guess .
that ...
that is my reward .
just ?
just get a clue !
thank god you' re all right .
yeah .
let' s thank god .
for his blessings are raining down upon me .
wait !
that' s not rain !
bruce , please don' t do that , honey .
you know that everything happens for a reason .
that i don' t need .
that is a cliche .
that is not helpful to me .
a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush .
i have no bird .
i have no bush .
god has taken my bird and my bush .
oh , i see .
so god is picking on you , is that what you' re saying ?
no .
he' s ignoring me completely .
he' s far too busy giving evan everything he wants .
oh , that' s great , sam , but you missed your target .
i' m over here !
don' t get mad at the dog .
it' s not the dog' s fault .
no .
it' s god' s fault .
i gave him the wrong coordinates .
all right .
you know what ?
enough .
all right ?
will you stop being such a martyr ?
i am not being a martyr .
i' m a victim .
god is a mean kid sitting on an anthill with a magnifying glass , and i' m the ant .
he could fix my life in five minutes if he wanted to , but he' d rather burn off my feelers and watch me squirm !
sweetheart , i know you' re mad .
it' s understandable .
what evan did is slimy and wrong , but this day could' ve been so much worse .
i' m just glad you' re okay .
okay ?
news flash !
i' m not okay .
i' m not okay with a mediocre job !
i' m not okay with a mediocre apartment .
i' m not okay with a mediocre life !
so is that what you think that we have ?
a mediocre life ?
don' t make this about you .
about me ?
how could i make this about me ?
it' s about you !
it' s always about you !
perfect .
perfect .
i' il have the worst day of my life with a side order of guilt , please !
oh .
okay , god .
you want me to talk to you ?
then talk back .
tell me what' s going on .
what should i do ?
give me a signal .
oh , i need your guidance , lord .
please send me a sign .
ah , what' s this joker doin ' now ?
okay .
all right .
i' il try it your way .
all right .
lord , i need a miracle .
i' m desperate .
i need your help , lord .
please reach into my life .
hey !
what the he ...
i got ya !
ha ha !
hey !
fine !
the gloves are off , pal !
come on !
let me see a little wrath .
smite me , o mighty smiter !
you' re the one who should be fired !
the only one around here not doing his job is you !
answer me !
sorry .
don' t know ya .
wouldn' t call you if i did .
ohh .
oh , god .
ohh .
hello
oh , no !
sam , this has gotta stop .
all right .
now , get it straight here .
that' s the house .
this is the bathroom .
house .
bathroom .
bathroom .
house .
house .
bathroom .
bathroom .
house .
what' s the point ?
denied that promotion at work ?
is life unfair ?
is there someone less talented than you reaping all the benefits ?
is your name bruce ?
then do we have the job for you .
we' re located at 7725623rd street .
so come on down , or we' il just keep beeping you .
omni presents .
oh , yeah .
the glass is half full .
oh , geez !
come on !
look !
what is that ?
what is that ?
ah , geez !
thank you .
thank you again .
what the ...
you' re looking for room 7 .
yeah .
i figured .
you want me to even those up for you ?
how do i get to room 7 ?
that' il be on the seventh floor .
stairs are right over there .
i' d rather take the elevator .
out of order .
i love the stairs though .
they were my second choice .
do you mind giving me a hand with this floor ?
what ?
that' s good .
are you serious ?
oh , uh , i' m kind of busy .
um , rain check .
i' il hold you to it .
i' m free on the seventh at 7 : 00 .
seventh at 7 : 00 it is .
this looks promising .
hello ?
another " hugantic ,
ginormic " waste of my life .
hello ?
yo !
i' m lookin ' for whoever runs this joint .
be right with you .
i' m trying to fix a light .
tell me if it' s working .
yeah .
seems to be .
kind ofbright , though .
yeah .
it is for most people .
spend their lives in the dark trying to hide from me .
oh , the elevator' s broken , huh ?
yeah , but i' il get around to it .
you install the clapper ?
no , but catchy jingle , isn' t it ?
clap on , clap off
clap on , clap off the clapper
just can' t get it out of my head .
good luck with that .
i' m gonna go now .
okay .
but the boss' il be right out .
you must be bruce .
i' ve been expecting you .
this is hilarious .
so you' re the boss and the electrician and the janitor ?
must be a killer christmas party .
don' t get drunk , though .
one of you might need a ride home .
you always were funny , bruce , just like your father .
he didn' t mind rolling up his sleeves , either , son .
people underestimate the benefit of good old manual labor .
there' s freedom in it .
some of the happiest people in the world ... go home smelling to high heaven at the end of the day .
all right .
what is this ?
how do you know my father , and how did you get my pager number ?
oh , i know quite a lot about you , bruce ... just about everything there is to know .
everything you' ve ever said or done or thought about doing ... right there in that file cabinet .
wow .
a whole drawer just for me .
yeah .
mind if i take a look ?
it' s your life .
this oughta be good .
now , this last entry was a little disturbing .
the gloves are off , god .
god has taken my bird and my bush .
god is a mean kid with a magnifying glass .
smite me , o mighty smiter !
now , i' m not much for blaspheming , but that last one made me laugh .
are you spying on me ?
who are you ?
i' m the one .
huh ?
creator of the heavens and the earth , alpha and omega .
oh , i see where this is going .
bruce , i' m god .
bingo !
yahtzee !
is that your final answer ?
our survey says , " god !
bing , bing , bing , bing , bing !
well , it was nice to meet you , god .
thank you for the grand canyon , and good luck with the apocalypse .
oh , and by the way , you suck !
you know what would' ve been a little more impressive , though ?
if you hadn' t used the cheesy file cabinet illusion .
anybody with a brain stem can tell that that drawer ... is being fed through the wall from the other side .
all you have to do is find the crease , right around here .
there is a seam here ... or a hollow spot .
where ?
through the drywall and concrete ?
okay .
that is a good one .
that is a good one .
okay .
how many fingers am i holding up ?
now , bruce .
thou shalt not tempt the lord ...
hey , if you can' t do it , man , that' s cool .
three .
two .
four .
nine .
six .
eight .
one .
okay .
how many now ?
seven .
aha !
you' ve been doing a lot of complaining about me , bruce .
and quite frankly , i' m tired of it .
wait .
don' t come near me .
when i' m backed into a corner , i' m like a wild animal .
i don' t wanna hurt you , but i will , out of instinct .
you haven' t won a fight ... since grade five , and that was against a girl .
yeah , but she was huge .
she had been held back .
and the sun was in your eyes .
oh , there you go .
in a way , i brought you here to offer you a job .
job ?
what job ?
my job .
you think you can do it better , so here' s your chance .
when you leave this building , you will be endowed with all my powers .
whatever you say , pal .
okay .
that did not happen , and no one needs to hear about it .
i' m deleting the program .
no .
no .
i' m having a breakdown , that' s what it is .
normal , everyday psychotic episode caused by a tumor or brain lesion .
come on .
start !
that was lucky .
come on , man .
calm down .
you did not meet god ; you do not have his powers .
if that was god , then i' m clint eastwood .
holy hell !
be careful what you wish for , punk .
no .
uh uh !
no .
no .
i am a reasonable , sane human being with a .
44 magnum , the most powerful handgun in the wo ...
i' m not clint eastwood .
i' m bruce nolan .
bruce nolan .
i' m bruce no lan !
oh , it' s not real .
it' s not real .
coffee ?
yeah .
uh , coffee .
yeah .
we have a special on soup today .
no .
that' s fine .
thank you .
it' s tomato .
i made it myself .
okay .
okay .
excuse me .
i need a sp ...
it' s okay .
i found one .
here' s your soup .
oh , soup .
right .
uh , yeah .
right .
having fun ?
thy ...
thou ...
come .
take a closer walk with me .
let me explain the rules .
rules ?
yeah .
you left in such a rush , i didn' t get a chance to explain .
two extra fingers freaked me out a little bit .
i just figured i' d get your attention .
i did the same thing to gandhi ; he didn' t eat for three weeks .
anyway , here' s the deal .
you have all my powers .
use them any way you choose .
there are only two rules .
you can' t tell anybody you' re god .
believe me , you don' t want that kind of attention .
and you can' t mess with free will .
uh huh .
can i ask why ?
yes , you can !
that' s the beauty of it !
this is amazing .
speaking of amazing ...
excuse me .
oh .
holy sh ... cow .
since you' re through with these , i think i' il keep ' em .
might come in handy someday .
see you around , kid .
where you going ?
i' m taking a vacation .
god doesn' t take vacations , does he ?
do ... ye ?
did you ever hear of the dark ages ?
besides , i' m covered .
you can clear everything up in five minutes if you want to , right ?
ciao .
i' ve got the power " boom !
i' ve got the power
and he saw that it was good .
i' ve got the power
whoa .
gettin , gettin ' gettin' kind ofheavy
gettin , gettin ' gettin' kind ofheavy

oh , darn .
all this horsepower and no room to gallop .
heigh ho , silver , away !
i certainly wouldn' t want to be a fugitive on the run with hank ,
buffalo' s number one police dog on the job .
this is phil sidleman reporting from the police canine training center ,
channel 5 news .
and cut it .
hey hey !
look what the cat coughed up !
channel 7 , right ?
you' re the guy that went crazy ?
i had a bad moment .
what are you doing here ?
just looking for a story .
there' s no story here .
this pond is all fished out .
pretty standard stuff anyway .
i don' t know .
my instinct tells me there' s something more .
yeah ?
well , go with that .
it served you well in the past , right ?
mm hmm .
hey !
hank found something !
hey , we got a body !
over here !
get the camera !
now !
it' s locked , and the keys are inside !
i guess every dog has his day .
hey , kid .
you wanna make 10 bucks ?
you know how to use one of these ?
duh .
seems to be in tune .
let' s do this .
the body ofjimmy hoffa was uncovered in a field today ... outside of a canine training center in buffalo , new york .
bruce nolan was the first on the scene .
thank you , jane .
as you can see behind us , the body is being carefully exhumed ... and will be transported to a medical facility , where d. n. a. testing can confirm the identity .
that , however , merely a formality at this point , as in a bizarre twist , the body was found buried with a birth certificate ... and complete set of dental records .
i' d call that a red letter day for any k 9 unit , but was that enough for old hank here ?
no , sirree .
moments later , he busted a local news camera crew ...
with 220 pounds of marijuana .
i never saw it before , i swear !
i' m bruce nolan , and that' s the way the cookie crumbles .
yeah !
did you like that ?
yes .
thank you .
thank you .
hi , bruce .
oh , hi , susan .
good work .
i' m impressed .
jack , did you need me for something ?
bruce !
bruce !
just the man i wanna see .
hey .
hoffa ?
what are the odds of that ?
what are the odds of that ?
bruce , why don' t you sit down ?
okay .
i' m gonna be straight with you .
we want you back , bruce .
but i want you to understand it was not my decision to let you go .
when the big guy gives the order , you gotta ...
no harm , no foul , jack .
i needed some time to reassess my goals and get in touch with my true self .
you did that in a day ?
imagine what i could do with seven .
look , bruce .
it is not in my power to give you anchor .
now , as far as field reporting goes , if you' re looking for a bump ...
jack , let' s just cut the crap and get down to brass tacks here .
i' m kidding with you , and you ...
i had you going , jackie .
don' t even worry about it , old friend .
you just give me a camera , jack ; i' il give you the news .
a little less conversation a little more action
all this aggravation ain' t" satisfactioning" me
my secret is that i let thejalapenos marinate ... in a spicy sauce for at least 24 hours before i stir it into the chili .
then i let it all come to a simmer b ...
oh !
hold that thought , hazel !
it seems as if an asteroid or some kind of meteorite ... has just hit ground right outside the mark twain chili cook off .
this should certainly spice things up a bit .
his stories are all over town .
from unearthing jimmy hoffa ...
to a meteor crashing to earth ...
bruce nolan is rapidly becoming known as ...
yeah a little less conversation a little more action
all this conversation ain' t" satisfactioning" me
a little more bite and a little more bark
a little less fight and a little more spark
and that' s the way the cookie crumbles !
was this bruce' s idea ?
uh huh .
he said he wanted me to have a day of beauty and luxurious serenity .
i gotta tell you .
he is really impressing me lately .
you know where he' s taking me to dinner tonight ?
hmm .
where ?
the blue palm ?
mm hmm .
oh , my gosh .
i just got chills .
i know .
and he told me to prepare for the most memorable night of our entire lives .
oh , my gosh .
grace , he' s gonna propose .
stop it .
no .
really ?
yeah .
really .
come on .
you do the math .
he sends you all day to a beauty spa .
he' s taking you to the most romantic restaurant , where you had your first date .
you know , i never thought i' d say this , but bruce is right .
this is your big night .
relax and enjoy it .
oh , god .
ow .

more power outages reported today ... caused by last week' s meteorite strike .
officials are desperately trying to repair several transformers ... damaged by the ensuing electrical surge .
the scene nearly turned violent when hundreds of disgruntled buffalo residents ... protested last week' s lottery results .
and doomsayers are pointing to last week' s strange celestial events ... as signs that prophesy is now being fulfilled ... and the world as we know it may be coming to an end .
world' s gone mad .
bruce , 30 seconds to air .
okay .
okay .

it' s your big debut .

what in the blue blazes ...
we' il be back with the sabres ' stanley cup victory in just a hot second .
in other news ...
bloody hell !
for the love of god , what is it now ?
the whole booth is down .
no , it' s not !
in other news , fighting erupted in ... the gaza strip today , as israelis and palestinians ...
bruce .
we' ve got a situation here .
what ?
they' re rioting right outside the station .
you' re kidding .
the whole town has gone crazy .
come on , bruce .
say something .
uh , ladies and gentlemen , this just in .
possibly ... the biggest breaking news story this town has ever seen .
and i gotta go .
i' m sorry , jack .
susan , it' s all yours .

clap on .
clap on !
clap on !
clap on !

this god business .
they' re all out of control .
it' s mayhem .
i don' t know what to do .
well , you' re right on time ... 7 : 00 .
the seventh at 7 : 00 .
all righty then .
there we are .
it' s good .
it' s good !
it' s a wonderful thing .
no matter how filthy something gets , you can always clean it right up .
there were so many , i just gave them all what they wanted .
yeah , but since when ... does anyone have a clue about what they want ?
so what do i do ?
parting your soup is not a miracle , bruce .
it' s a magic trick .
a single mom who' s working two jobs ... and still finds time to take her kid to soccer practice , that' s a miracle .
a teenager who says no to drugs and yes to an education , that' s a miracle .
people want me to do everything for them .
but what they don' t realize is they have the power .
you wanna see a miracle , son ?
be the miracle .
wait .
are you leaving ?
yeah .
i see that you can handle things now .
but what if i need you .
what if i have questions ?
that' s your problem , bruce .
that' s everybody' s problem .
you keep looking up .
order has been restored in buffalo ... after this evening' s downtown riot .
state officials have suspended all lottery sales ... pending further investigation .
no injuries were reported in the melee ; however , there were dozens ...
i' ve gotta be honest i think you know
we' re covered in lies and that' s okay
okay . " there' s somewhere beyond this i know
well , thanks a million .
god bless .
oh , not a problem .
hope i can find the words to say
" never again , no " bruce giveth ... and bruce taketh away .
if you don' t like it , megabyte me . " ' cause you' re a god and i am not
and i just thought that you would know
evan .
bruce .
i suppose you' re here to gloat about the anchor position .
go ahead .
take your best shot .
actually , i , uh ...
i just came to tell you that i' ve been a royal prick .
the anchor position is yours .
i turned down the job .
oh , and i never really congratulated you in the first place .
congratulations . " ' cause you' re a god and i am not " thanks , bruce .
in the financial world , things are settling back to normal ... in what analysts are calling a fluke market fluctuation .
you made the right move , jack .
so what about you ?
are you ready to go back out there ?
and do the cutesy stuff ?
the lighter side of the news ?
lower and debase myself for the amusement of total strangers ?
yeah , i could do that .
sounds like fun .
good .
okay , sammy , let' s do it right , like all the other dogs .
i don' t wanna make you feel bad , but they' re laughing at you .
they' re laughing at you .
come on .
concentrate .
there you go .
come on .
pump it out if you have to .
what am i gonna do with you ?
i know this seems kinda crazy , but desperate times ... calls for desperate measures .
yeah .
okay .
okay , sammy .
