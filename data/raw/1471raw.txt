look over here .
he' s marking himself .
what ?
ancient warriors would mark themselves with the blood of their kill .
it' s a rite of passage .
this is starting to make sense .
the hieroglyphs are a little difficult to make out .
but the story is all here .
thousands of years ago , these hunters found a backwater planet .
they taught humans how to build and were worshipped as gods .
every hundred years the gods would return .
and when they did , they would expect a sacrifice .
humans were used to breed the ultimate prey .
the hunters would battle with these great serpents to prove themselves worthy to carry the mark .
but if the hunters lost , they made sure nothing survived .
an entire civilization wiped out overnight .
so ... the humanoids , the hunters they brought those creatures here to hunt ?
and they use us like cattle .
we' re hosts for them to breed in .
the heat bloom was the sign to lure us down here .
this whole thing was a trap .
without us , there could be no hunt .
shit !
verheiden !
oh , shit .
when that door opens , we' re dead .
not if we set things right .
what do you mean ?
this pyramid is like a prison .
we took the guards ' guns , and now the prisoners are running free .
to restore order , the guards need their guns .
when that door opens , we' re gonna give that thing his gun back .
are you crazy ?
during a big game hunt , the animals being hunted don' t arm the hunters .
they' re not hunting us .
we' re in the middle of a war .
it' s time to pick a side .
we are on our side .
we have to consider the possibility that we might not make it out of here .
but we have to make sure those serpents don' t reach the surface .
because if they do , everything everywhere could die .
the enemy of my enemy ... is my friend .
let' s go find our friend .
how do you say " scared shitless " in italian ?
non vedo i' ora di uscire con te da questa piramide perch mi sto cagando addosso .
more or less .
move !
lex .
lex .
hold on .
come on , lex .
oh , no .
wait .
wait .
please , wait .
the enemy of my enemy is my friend .
the enemy of my enemy is my friend .
i' m coming with you .
you hear me , you ugly creature ?
what are you doing ?
miller !
miller !
sebastian .
help me , lex .
i' m gonna get you out of there .
it' s too late .
it' s inside me .
i' m gonna get you outta here .

i have to help him .
lex !
they mustn' t reach the surface .
they mustn' t reach the surface .
i know .
