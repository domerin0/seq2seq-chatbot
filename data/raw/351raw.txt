back in the ' 70s , every cop wanted out of the city .
but the only cops allowed to live outside new york were transit cops .
because the transit authority was also run byjersey and connecticut .
so these guys i knew at the 3 7 ... they started pulling overtime at subway stations ... and got the city to declare them " auxiliary transit cops .
they bought some land in jersey .
got some cheap loans from people they knew .
they made themselves a place where the shit couldn' t touch ' em .
every precinct has its " cop bar , " a private club , all blue .
for the 3 7 , it was the 4 aces ... just across the river .
this armenian guy , he' s from the other side over there .

oh . !
someone' s been dumping garbage , garbage bags .
uh huh .
is that them ?
just one of them .
the rest are mine .
i don' t tell joey , ' cause then he thinks he' s got to deal with it .
not that he doesn' t think much of the local ... about you guys .
i' il take care of it .
it' s okay .
he' s got the city to worry about , right ?
anyway ...
what' s the point with the black garbage bag ?
it' s just i found your phone bill in a black garbage bag down the street .
so , what if i said i didn' t know where it came from ?
i' d take your word for it , rose .
is ray home ?

you didn' t marry him .
no .
but i' m your friend .
freddy , look , i gotta go .
and let me be clear .
it was the system that drove murray " superboy " babitch off that bridge .
murray babitch was a hero cop .
he deserved a fair hearing , but he knew this would not happen , not in this city .
activist cyril johns met the parents of the slain teens ... calling for a human blockade on the bridge tomorrow .
a drunk cop jumps off a bridge .
that does not erase the murder of two black children .
attending the yankee game , mayor farelli responded to reports ...
of cops attempting to plant evidence on the bridge .
shh .
shh .
we are looking into it .
there may have been some irregularity on the bridge .
but as i say ...
your mother' s an irregularity .
no more comments , please .
i' m here to enjoy the ball game with my wife .
thank you .
oh , that' s your boss .
are you kidding ?
you' il never get another raise in your life .
who' s gonna tell ?
diagonal rule .
hmm ?
diagonal rule .
red light , don' t fight .
you make a right .
it' s more important than the golden rule .
if superboy knew that , he' d still be alive , freddy .
yo . !
yo , yo .
freddy , i heard you saved ollie the turtle today .
what happened to your nose ?
ah , nothing .

what is that ?
what , are you some kind of high roller ?
fuck you , figgs .
i had 12 points .
against the 5 time nba champs ?
what kind of bet is that ?
you know , you night guys ... you watch way too much oprah when you should be catching your " z' s .
uh huh , figgs , well at least i' m not the one sniffin ' my money away .
that was your inner child making that wager , joey .
little boyjoey with the little met poster taped above his bed .

i don' t care .
yeah ?
you like eatin ' doughnuts ?
look , freddy .
i say it' s okay to bejealous .
you saved this girl' s life , right ?
from it , from risking yourself from saving her sorry ass , you go deaf as a result .
in one ear .
in one ear .
then you have to watch as this girl you saved , this beauty queen ... marries this cocksucker !
and you , with your ear , you can' t even get a desk on the force .
you' re fucked .

i would .

he was trying to get on the force , but he had this problem with his ear .
you' re not a lip reader , are ya ?
no , no .
it' s just this one ear when i was a kid i had this accident .
you should call me .
i mean , when ray donlan puts his thumb in the air ...
it' s not the force , but i got my own people .
call me .
is he serious ?
freddy , my boy , that is how things happen .
see you later .
eternal god , our father , the lord of our life and death ... we acknowledge thee in all our ways and in all events which befall us .
what' s in the coffin ?
his uniform .
then in thy great mercy , grant us a safe lodging and a holy rest .
and peace at last through jesus christ , our lord .
amen .
unto god' s gracious mercy and protection , we commit you .
the lord bless you and keep you .
the lord make his face to shine upon you , and be gracious unto you .
the lord lift up his countenance upon you and give you peace ... both now and forevermore .
amen .
psst .
hi , sheriff .
how you doin ' ?
how you doin ' ?
this is detective carson .
how' s it goin ' ?
come on in .
it' s your office .
that there is manny cardoza and his brother .
they' re drug runners .
hmph .
i didn' t know they allowed classical music in jersey .
who' s this ?
toy torillo .
you heard of him ?
oh , yes .
hmm .
i don' t know how you do it , sheriff .
keeping all these hessians in line .
all blue .
everybody packing .
all together .
one door down from the next .
the wives borrowing the sugar .
it' s like you' re the sheriff of copland .
hmm .
look at this .
hmm .
you see , sheriff , i got a sticky problem .
myjurisdiction ends , in a sense , at the george washington bridge .
but half the men i watch live beyond that bridge ... where no one' s watching .
i' m watching .
i can see that .
you' ve got a crime rate here of about , what ?
the lowest in northern new jersey .
you got hoboken and jersey city over here .
newark .
we try to do a good job with what we have .
with a staff of three ?
no , sheriff .
what you got is a town that scares the shit out of certain people .
lieutenant , i told you , i' m watching .
i mean , if you look around you see none of these people are wearing silk shirts .
their pools are above ground .
you know ?
you raise your family somewhere decent , i guess that' s a crime now .
lieutenant , look around .
this is a town with a population of 1, 000 people .
i got news for you .
not all cops are dirty .
i' m not saying they are .
he used to come by , have drinks with the guys .
he never caused any problems .
you mind if i sit down ?
we buried a suit today .
we buried a suit today !
that doesn' t bother you ?
he jumped off the g. w. b. yeah , but his body never hit the water .
that doesn' t bother you .
what does ?
that i investigate cops ?
being a man who always pined to be a cop ?
i am a cop .
pined to be n. y. p. d.
three forced absent , ten years .
appeals of hearing tests .
right ?
you may be law enforcement , and so am i , but you are not a cop .
now , i may watch cops .
but tell me if i' m wrong .
every day out these windows , so do you .
you watch cops too .
and since we are both law enforcement , we share a duty .
do we not ?
if there is a stink , we must investigate .
we must gather evidence because evidence makes us see the truth .
is this the stink of a criminal act ... or is it a turd in a bag ?
i' il tell you something , sheriff ...
i see cops who lose their way every day ... and i don' t like that ... because their ambivalence is contagious .
they infect those around them .
they' re like maggots ... where you find one , you find a nest ... and i take that real personally .
i went to the same academy as our friend there .
ray ?
good man .
i stood by him at graduation .
he was a beauty .
he' s been good to me .
yeah , a real collar man .
to the cop that he was , to his memory , i am loyal ... but through the fog of my loyalty , to the men ... the evidence makes me see and , these days , what i see ...
like an island out of my reach ...
i see this beautiful island shining through this fog ... every house financed by one of two mob banks .
that' s right , sheriff .
what i see is your town .
no , no you don' t see that .
babitch isn' t dead .
you know that and i know that .
ray got him off that bridge alive ... before he could talk .
but he wasn' t so lucky the last time when the shit hit the fan with tunney .
that boy he took care oflater .
but now what ?
what does ray do now ?
that' s the $64, 000 question .
and that' s why i' m here .
that' s why i' m here , sheriff .
because you' re on the inside .
and besides the church traffic , and the cats in the trees ... and all that other bullshit , okay ... there isn' t much here for you to do to keep your mind busy .
but i look at you , sheriff ... and i see a man who' s waiting for something to do .
and here i am .
here i am saying , " sheriff ...
i got something for you to do .
# so let' s make the most of this beautiful day #
# since we' re together we might as well say # d would you be mine could you be mine d d won' t you be my neighbor #
you know , figgsy ... you don' t have to sleep at the station if you don' t want to .
you can stay in my basement until you find a new place .
let' s go . !
it' s gonna be a long day , poppa !
okay , your turn to be a hero .
billy heard they' re having a party tonight .
# we had so many good times #

# we shared the happiness # i' il take care of it , phil .

how do you think ...
freddy , what are you talking about ?
this guy came to see me yesterday , this moe tilden from i. a.
he brought all these pictures and ...
freddy .
that guy' s had a hard on for me for years .
it' s a personal thing .
he is a scumbag .
all right .

they catch you on the take .
and they tell you you can either do time or join ' em .
well , he knows you know superboy is ...
i told him he was dead , ray .
i told him he was wrong about you , but ...
i' m the sheriff .
i mean , i' m supposed to know what' s goin ' on .

liz , you wanna come inside ?
# i met a little girl and i settled down #
you can get this on cd , you know ... in stereo .
it wouldn' t matter to me .
all right .
# we got married #
you know , it' s a funny thing when you owe someone your life .
# then little by little #
# we drifted from each other' s arms #
why is it you never got married , freddy ?
# it was just restlessness #
all the best girls were taken .
# and it was somethin' more i guess #
# that tore us apart and made us weep #
# i' m drivin' a stolen car #
# down on eldridge avenue #
# each night i wait to get caught #
# but i never do #
this is crazy .
yes .
all right , take it easy .

with community leaders and pundits crying " cover up ,
mayor farelli' s suspension of the babitch case is a big gamble ...
no one' s going to read this .
it' s just a bunch of red tape .
she' s going to fuck up my insurance claim .
don' t pull the paper out of the thing .
here' s your coffee .
okay , cin , please let' s try it his way .
i' m tellin ' you , you don' t need to do this .
it' s just a bunch of bullshit .
what do you want ?
are you gonna help us or not ?
help you help what ?
help ray here find him ?
help ray finish cleaning up his goddamn pool with the guy' s head ?
is that it ?
huh , mr. humanitarian ?
you got something you wanna say to me , ray ?
or is this about something a little more personal ?
i' m on at 10 : 00 .
i' m outta here .
we all are .
we got another hour .
hey , come on , joey .
instead of taking cop lessons from a cokehead ... maybe you should be lookin ' at that fire , you know ?
my girl over at chase says figgs is missing a few payments .
where were you that night , jack ?
i had nothin ' to do with it .
that would be retribution .
and that i leave to god almighty .
i' m gandhi .
i' m tellin' ya , the mob built this town for ray ... so they could own a fuckin ' precinct .
he' s a deep and dark motherfuck .
what you' re feelin ' right now , freddy ... friendless , angry , nervous , misunderstood ... this is it , this is the life .
you' re lucky your ear kept you off the force .
you know ... if i saw liz ... drowning in the water ...
if i saw that today ...
i wouldn' t go in .
i' d stand there , and i' d think about it .
and that' s the best thing i ever did with my life .
so ?
so ?
so you wanna sit around your whole life wishing you were on the force ?
or do you wanna bring the faggot in ?
let him spill .
i wouldn' t know where to begin .
all right .
brother' s in deep shit .
he' s down , he' s bleeding , and you gotta get there .
but there' s lights , right ?
all over the city , red lights .
you go through the red lights .
sure , you fire up the roof , you wail , you go through the red lights , but that' s slow ... fighting your way through traffic .
the goal is perpetual motion .
you want greens .
but how do you ensure the greens ?
you can' t .
as in life , in traffic .
so what you do is you leave yourself an out .
at every corner you leave yourself an alternative .
you move diagonal .
you turn the wheel when you hit a red light .
you don' t drive down broadway to get to broadway .
if you move diagonal , you' re gonna get perpetual motion .
that' s what you want .
but how does this apply to what you were saying in there ?
it applies , freddy !
it' s just as easy to tail a man walking in front of him .
now , you butt heads with these friends of ours , you' re gonna come at them head on ?
okay .
they got lives , freddy .
families .
no .
you move diagonal .
you jag .
ah , christ . !
where the fuck are you guys ?
we' re on our way ... in 20 .
i' m down .
but , butjoey , he' s tryin' to hold on ... but this big bastard , he cut me up .
stay cool , tom .
i need your location .
agh . !
he' s a fucking monster . !
i need your location . !
i need an assist .
i can' t move .
i think he cut my tendon .
you got a wife , huh ?
huh ?
you got a baby ?
quit !
tell me you quit .
i' il let you go .
you go home .
kiss your wife .
eat your baby' s fruit loops and shit .
you thank me , motherfucker , you' re gonna be redeemed .
re re redeemed ...
officer ...
randone .
shit !
motherfucker !
shit .
it' s the roof , jack .

joey' s in trouble , ray .
ray , let' s just break the fuckin' thing down .

his father is serving a life sentence for murder , murdering an ex girlfriend ...
with a sawed off shotgun back in 1988 .
the new york times is quoting one friend of royster saying ... that the guy had an i. q. of 160 .
i need your help .
they' re tryin ' to kill me .

my friends tried to kill me .
ray donlan ... tried to kill me .
shit !
holy shit !
speak of the devil !
freddy , forget it .
i don' t get this .
this doesn' t make any sense .
why' d they get superboy off the bridge ... bring him back here and kill him ?

moe , i apologize .
he just walked in here .
i' m sorry for rushing in like this , but you were right .
they tried to kill him like you said , but he got away .
now he' s runnin ' through the woods .
he' s like a scared animal .
he' s scared to death .
that motherfucker should be scared .
his uncle got this case closed with one phone call .
look , i' m sorry it took so long for me to come around , but you were right .
i couldn' t see the truth .
like you said , the evidence , my loyalty , they were confusing .
they never give you any napkins in this place .
what am i supposed to use ?
you want this ?
what is this ?
you came to me , to my town ... with all these speeches , talking to me about doing the right thing .
i' m doing the right thing .
what' s goin ' on ?
what are you doing ?
that was like two weeks ago .
two weeks ago ?
what about babitch ?
what about him ?
fuck him .
what about donlan ?
fuck him too .
what about joey randone ?
he fell off a building .
don' t you read the papers ?
listen , sheriff , i' m really sorry ... to have awoken you from your slumber , but it' s over .
hands are tied now .
you shut me down .
no , listen to me .
you' re i. a. that' s why i came to you .
you can do whatever you want .
remember you came to me , said , " you wanna be a cop ?
i' m bein ' a cop .
i offered you a chance .
i' m asking you for some help .
i need to do something .
i need to do this for myself .
listen , you deaf fuck .
i offered you a chance .
when we could have done something , i offered you a chance to be a cop ... and you blew it !
you blew it .
you people are all the same .
that cupcake makes a mess , we got a case again .
the mob runs millions in drugs through their precinct ... and everybody gets a nice house .
figgs is right .
the mob owns this town .
they closed the case , freddy .
if they don' t have ...
the stomach for it ...
they had to .
it' s circumstantial .
you don' t have anything either .
all that stuff is illegal .
you stole it .
i know this guy .
he' s a corrections officer .
they took care oftunney when he was gonna talk .
then how come figgis didn' t do somethin ' about it ?
he was ray' s right hand man back then .
then they tried to kill superboy .
they were hiding him , freddy .
then they burned down figgsy' s house when they think he might talk .
you don' t know that .
we went over every inch of that house .
not everything is a hexagonal conspiracy .
i think you been hangin ' around figgs too much .
he' s the only one getting cash out of that house , and he' s totally playing you ... just like those assholes in the city .
and i' m sorry , but ... there' s nothing you can do about this .
yes , there is .
i can find superboy and i can bring him in .
i' m going back upstate .
i want my old job back .
i don' t want any part of this .
i don' t want any part of this place .
come on , cindy .
geez .
freddy , look , i don' t know about ray , okay ?
but everyone in garrison is not a murderer .
no .
they just keep their eyes closed and their mouths shut just like me .
## [ carnival ]

i just hope you' re not trying to prove anything , freddy .
i know some of them are real assholes .
you know .
they think they' re high priests or somethin ' .
i don' t know .
but why would they do all this ?
you know , maybe they' re doin ' the right thing .
liz , i saw these pictures of ray meeting with these guys .
you know , like mobsters .
everyone' s houses are financed by these mob banks .
says who ?
i. a. ?
even you said joey' s death was no accident .
joey fell off a building , freddy !
okay ?
now , i don' t need this opened up .
maybe you do .
i don' t .
all joey wanted was a place for us to live .
now , who are you to judge that until you' ve walked in his shoes ?
maybe that' s what you' re tryin ' to do with me .
what' re you gonna do , freddy ?
huh ?
you gonna arrest the whole town ?
you goin ' to new york to take " paint by number " cop lessons ?
you know , ray likes you .
that don' t mean i' m gonna let you fuck him over .
ray donlan gave you this job , freddy .
you forgot that ?
we made your sorry ass !
so now you can do us a favor , huh ?
you could tell us ...
where superboy is .
if i knew where he was , he' d be in the city already .
you' re gonna be hurtin ' , freddy .
you' re not gonna know when , you' re not gonna know where .
you' re gonna be hurtin ' .
you mark my words .
i' m watchin ' you !
hey .

yep .
thanks to you , freddy .
filing out those forms in such a timely fashion .

you know ?
anyway , i' m sure you could use your privacy , freddy .

i took care of it .
that lady cop ... from the bomb squad got you the stuff to do this with , didn' t she ?
you didn' t know monica was gonna be here .
did you , figgs ?
no .
monica said ... she was going over to her friend' s house to watch some pay per view .
the thing was on a timer .
i didn' t know she was gonna be here , freddy .
it' s all bullshit .
you , figgs , are the bullshit !
smarten fuckin ' up !
you even turned your back on tunney when he needed your help .
figgs !
i' m gonna find superboy , and i' m gonna bring him in .
and for once , everybody in this town' s gonna tell the truth .
you gotta find him first , freddy !
i' il find him .
listen to me .
i got a check in my pocket for $200, 000 .
i got a chance to start my life again .
i don' t give a shit about this town .
i don' t give a shit about that town .
and i don' t give a shit about your fucking justice .
bein ' right is not a bulletproof vest , freddy .
go on , figgsy !
go on . !
run away . !
hey , freddy .
ray' s not home .
i know .
i' m lookin ' for your nephew .
i don' t know where he is .

rose , i' m his only chance .

bill , where are you ?
bill , if you read , we' re going back to the station .
you gonna keep me in here ?
you gonna keep me in here with cuffs ?
you don' t know what you' re doing do you ?
shut up .
you don' t have a clue as to what the fuck is going on , do you , sheriff ?
bill , do you copy ?
bill , do you read ?
it' s just club soda , freddy .
finish it .
hey , ray .
hey , freddy .
i came to tell you that i found superboy ... and i' m bringing him in tomorrow morning ... and i' d like you to come with me , i owe you that much .
he' s a fugitive , and he' s convinced you' re tryin ' to kill him .
just tell me where he is , freddy .
you got him at the station ?
ray , there' s gotta be a way out of this for everyone .
so , i say why don' t we all go in tomorrow together .
listen to me , freddy .
you know the difference between men and boys ?
boys bet everything on everything .
boys think every hand is a royal flush .
you play cards with a man , he knows his limits .
freddy , i invited men ... cops , good men ... to live in this town .
and these men , to make a living , they cross that bridge every day ... to a place where everything is upside down .
where the cop is the perp , and the perp is the victim .
but they play by the rules .
they keep their guns in their holsters , and they play by the rules .
the only thing they did was to get their families out ... before it got to them .
we made a place where things make sense ... and you can walk across the street without fear .
and you come to me with a plan to set things right .
everyone in this city holding hands , singing " we are the world .
that' s very nice .
but , freddy , your plan is the plan of a boy .
you made it on the back of a matchbook without thinking !
without looking at the cards .
i look at the cards .
i see this town ... destroyed .
now , that' s not what you want , is it ?
i look at this town ... and i don' t like what i see anymore .
who the fuck do you think you are ?
the sheriff of garrison , new jersey .
then be the sheriff !
defend this town !
protect these men !
freddy , you got him at the station ?
just drop the keys .
a little too rich for my blood .
maybe they fell out of your pocket ... or maybe cindy' s .
now you go home and you sleep ... and you wake up and you guide the traffic through this town ... and everything will be the way it was .
i' m taking him in tomorrow morning at 6 : 00 .
that' s in a few hours .
i' d like you to come with me , ray .
there' s nothing i can say ?
okay , then 6 : 00 it is .
yeah .
no , lis .
who was he supposed to call ?
ray knows everybody .
what am i supposed to do ?
let him go in alone ?
what ?
you know what ?
okay , fine .
why don' t you go home ?
i mean ...
i wanna be here for you , freddy , but ...
lisa' s nervous , you know .
she' s pregnant .
i mean ...
so , go on .
i' il be fine .
you be careful , freddy , huh ?
yeah .
you too .
shut the fuck up !
would ya , please ?
sh ...
fuck !
come on .
come on .
oh , shit !
get out , you jackass .
i said , get out , buddy .
oh , jesus .
you guys don' t wanna do this .
jack .
don' t shit in your pants .
he' s not gonna kill ya .
this is the good one , right ?
oh , god !
oh , god !
