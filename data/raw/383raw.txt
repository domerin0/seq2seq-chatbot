the entire tribe must not be endangered . . . . . . because of the defiance of one person .
you must forget about him .
he was a wild spirit and this was always to be his fate .
you talk as if he' s already dead
even if he does survive this time , he' s a greener . . . . . . so set your sights elsewhere for a husband .
i' il never set my sights elsewhere .
this is all the medicine i could find .
i' m sorry .
the gods took your father in the night .
as long as we stay here , there' il never be enough to eat .
never .
there may be other places we could live where food is plentiful .
all it takes is one demon to follow you back from the forbidden land .
then we' d all be struck down .
have you ever seen one ?
have you ?
has anyone here ever seen one ?
a demon ?
a monster !
a beast !
the stories are true .
the gods used to live here .
they watched over and protected man , but man grew selfish . . . . . . and cruel .
so the gods left . . . . . . allowing the demons to descend from the sky .
as survivors , we must dedicate our lives to pleasing the gods . . . . . . so that one day they will come back and drive away the demons .
that is our fate .
only if you believe in fate .
i' m sorry .
i can' t take you .
i can' t handle myself as well as a man ?
no .
you arrogant greener .
you can handle yourself better than most men . . . . . . which is why you need to help the village .
your mother gave this to me before she died .
she hoped it' d be passed to your children .
it' s for good luck .
don' t let anything happen to you out there .
easy !
easy !
so you' re the beast we' re all afraid of .
not a lot of meat on a dragon .
you have been fortunate in the hunt .
i hope you thanked the gods .
a nonbeliever .
i believe what i can see .
a nonbeliever , huh ?
you from the caves ?
probably never seen a god .
would you like to ?
what do you know about gods ?
we' ve seen gods .
rock and l .
you lying thieves .
wait a minute .
wait a minute , we' re hunting .
no time to show you gods with no food .
we need food .
we must hunt .
nonbeliever .
wait .
first you show me the god .
then we eat .
look .
frozen ones .
the way to the great god village is marked by these frozen ones .
when the gods left this world , they ordered man not to look at them .
those that disobeyed were frozen in place for all of eternity .
when the gods lived here they could fly through the air .
they' d drive chariots in front of special caves with golden arches .
golden .
and the food would magically appear .
magic .
here !
the gods weren' t allowed to fall in love with mortal women .
this one did . . . . . . and was left behind , frozen as punishment .
are you sure this was a god ?
i thought you said you believe what you can see .
if you need proof . . . . . . when the sun goes down , you can see the rest of the gods in the sky .
they' re the bright lights .
the evil beasts hunt in the dark .
we need to find shelter .
there' s a cave over here .
look at those poor bastards .
they really angered the gods .
carlo .
let' s eat .
go .
go .
what' s a " greener " ?
the grass is greener on the other side .
always looking for something better , something out there .
maybe she was right .
god stone .
sharp .
no , you keep it .
you keep it .
where we' re from , a good woman is a hard thing to find .
so if you were stupid enough to leave a good woman behind . . . . . . why don' t you tell me where she is so i can go get her for myself ?
no !
forget about me .
get out of here .
i can' t move !
no !
oh , heavenly gods !
don' t breathe the air !
it' s poison !
my chest is on fire !
it helps you breathe .
take it !
i can' t !
get off my brother .
what' s he saying ?
don' t know .
who' s responsible for allowing him to run around ?
he shot the wrangler .
i' m a little pressed for time .
save the going away jokes for later .
no joke , sir .
i swear .
the man animal got ahold of this gun .
really ?
show me .
sir ?
reach for the gun .
but , sir , i might get shot .
sure , you might .
and i might suddenly grow a third arm !
but it shot the wrangler .
any report filed today still has my name on it . . . . . . and you are out of your skull bone if you think i' m going to write . . . . . . " shot by a man animal " as the cause of death unless i see it !
if i obey your command , i may get killed .
if you don' t , it' s a certainty you will be killed .
reach for the gun .
well , i' il be damned .
teleportation sequence activated .
teleportation sequence activated .
it is a pleasure to see you , your excellency .
i would be honored to expedite your clearance through security .
please , call me zete .
does all of earth look like this ?
i' m afraid so , sir .
pathetic .
all the green and the blue sky .
they told me this planet was ugly , but this is one of the ugliest . . . . . . in the entire universe .
i couldn' t agree more .
i hate these puny , undersized planets .
the gravity is so different .
one does get used to it .
and the human animals , grossly undersized .
they don' t make good eating , your excellency .
my executive assistant , ker .
thank you .
he has been fully trained to replace me as chief of security .
as soon as my transfer goes through .
well , ker . . . . . . once we finish mining out this miserable little planet . . . . . . iet' s do the universe a favor .
let' s exterminate the lot of them .
oh , you' re too much .
so they tell me .
please , come this way .
spy satellites recorded those .
what is this species ?
according to the clinko historians . . . . . . the species is called " dog .
dog .
yes .
obviously the superior race , having the man animal chauffeur .
well , dogs did prove to be more cooperative than the man animals .
they weren' t as useful when it came to manual labor .
i am honored by your visit , your excellency .
thank you , planetship .
you' il be pleased .
i approved additional labor resources .
they' il be here by the end of quarter cycle .
thank you , your excellency .
now , let' s see .
your long overdue transfer .
you must be looking forward to getting off this disgusting excuse of a planet .
i just want to do whatever serves the corporation best , sir .
very admirable .
and i must say , you' ve done . . . . . . a first rate job here as interim security chief .
hear , hear !
hear , hear !
i do what i can .
so we' ve decided to keep you for another tour of service .
there must be some mistake .
home office does not make mistakes .
of course not .
but have you looked at my file ?
it explicitly says that this is a temporary assignment .
are you not aware that i graduated top of my class ?
quite an accomplishment .
i don' t mean to second guess the home office . . . . . . but surely i could be of better service
home office is well aware of your academic achievements and talents .
that' s why we' ve decided not to keep you here for another five cycles .
it' s a joke .
thank you , sir .
i don' t know if i could' ve kept my sanity . . . . . . to be here another five cycles .
we' ve decided to keep you here for another 50 cycles !
with endless options for renewal !
those options , of course . . . . . . being at home office' s discretion .
not yours .
the senator . . .
. . . has a lot of friends .
would you please tell the senator . . . . . . if i' d had even an inkling that that was his daughter
watch your tongue .
if that blasted terl tries to talk his way out of it . . . . . . have him vaporized on the spot .
but cheer up .
there' s one bright side to this .
one day you' re going to die , and when you end up in hell . . . . . . at least it' il be a step up from this place .
you haven' t left for psychlo .
your powers of observation are simply startling .
give me three pans to go .
i don' t know what you' re so down about .
you still get to be head of security .
which , from what i can tell , is a pretty cushy job .
well , i can assure you . . . . . . that i was not groomed since birth to have some cushy job . . . . . . that even a moron like you could perform .
while you were still learning how to spell your name . . . . . . i was being trained to conquer galaxies !
to do anything less . . . . . . is a disgrace to my entire family line .
that' il be six credits .
put it on my tab .
you don' t have a tab .
i do now .
you' re new here , so i' il explain how it works .
i eat first .
then my men eat .
if there' s anything left , you can share it with them .
that' s how it used to work .
greener , let' s just stay alive .
you' re right .
so i' il fight you .
no .
without food , we don' t have strength to escape .
so now we' re escaping ?
i am .
come if you want .
we fight , it' s to the death .
say your prayers to the gods !
we have enough problems without killing each other over food .
from now on , we eat at the same time .
sir .
i was wondering when you' d look at that .
it came in last week , and i put it right in your box .
i' ve wasted my time , haven' t l ?
if you' re going to lie to me , have the decency to do a credible job . . . . . . so i don' t look like an idiot for training you .
but i' m not lying .
i put the photo in your box as soon as it came in .
you are pathetic .
you wouldn' t last one day at the academy .
and i saw you .
what ?
we use picto cameras to spy on other offices .
but under no circumstance do we spy on our own office .
that' s right .
we don' t .
i do .
start talking .
the photo' s from last week' s recon drone .
it shows a rockslide in the mountains .
it exposed a gold vein .
you were waiting for me to transfer . . . . . . so you could turn it in and get credit .
i didn' t think you' d mind .
i don' t mind .
turn it in .
but before you do , pretend you' re not . . .
. . . a complete imbecile . . . . . . and check the compo gradients .
it' s full of uranium .
no psychlo . . .
. . . can get there without his breath gas exploding .
no way to mine the gold .
but what i do mind is that you betrayed me over a lousy recon photo !
it' s worthless !
you said so !
but you didn' t know it was worthless !
i would never hurt you , sir .
i' m unarmed .
you can' t shoot me .
it' s against regulations , sir .
i can make this up to you , sir .
i promise .
i swear .
please , sir .
you do not have to shoot me , sir .
shoot you ?
my most trusted colleague ?
of course not .
we have work to do .
come .
tomorrow morning , we must warn the planetship of the mutiny .
what mutiny ?
the one you' re going to pretend is in the works . . . . . . iike your life depended on it .
because it does .
if the worker revolt takes place , my informants tell me . . . . . . that the first order of business is to separate you from your head .
which is why there will be no revolt .
i am authorizing you to use whatever means necessary to prevent it .
the best way is to increase profits and stop cutting the workers ' pay .
production equals profits .
and i' ve already ordered as many new workers as possible . . . . . . to boost production .
but we have to pay the new workers .
maybe you were absent the day they taught economics at the academy , ker .
but nobody works for free .
man animals do .
what if we were to train them how to mine ?
man animals operating machinery ?
have you blown a head gasket ?
i will be the laughingstock of the universe .
so you should have me take man animals . . . . . . with equipment , out to a remote area . . . . . . better that you don' t know where , and try and train them .
have them do some test mining .
if it doesn' t work out , no one will know .
right .
and if it does work . . . . . . i will be vaporized .
it is against the law .
regulations say . . . . . . a planetship faced with a profit threatening situation . . . . . . is relieved of all other ordinances . . . . . . to pursue , to protect and to acquire said profits .
there you have it .
we stick to the original plan .
bring in new workers . . . . . . and they go on half pay as soon as they arrive .
and that is final !
run !
run !
okay , now !
pull his breath mask off .
last time we didn' t even stop timing until its lungs burst .
that' s the wager .
no way this man animal lasts more than four minutes .
help me !
i need your air !
the wager' s off .
the damn thing cheated .
the planetship is hiding something .
all we have to do is find out what it is . . . . . . then we' il have leverage .
and then we can get the gold .
what do you mean , we ?
it' s my plan .
i' m sending the gold to psychlo , then i' m getting off this stinking planet .
come on , sir .
you gotta let me in on it .
i barely make any lousy credits in this job .
and i' ve got five wives to support , sir .
i don' t know if i want to partner up with an idiot .
how do i even know you understand the plan ?
we train man animals who don' t need breath gas . . . . . . to mine the gold for us .
but home planet owns this planet .
the gold belongs to them .
that' s the beauty of it .
home planet doesn' t know the gold exists .
those corporate crapheads won' t know we stole it .
it' s the perfect crime , sir .
putting aside the serious violations of teaching mining to inferiors . . . . . . and insulting corporate superiors , each one punishable by death .
so it is my duty to report you . . . . . . though you' il be vaporized , and i' il have to train a new assistant .
but it' s your stinking plan , sir .
so i' m glad i have a recording of you . . . . . . iaying out the plan and my reprimanding you .
think of it as part of your education .
education , huh ?
never engage in a criminal activity unless you have a patsy to pin it on . . . . . . in case you ever get found out .
thank you .
that' s great .
but why do i have to be the patsy ?
so you don' t get any bright ideas to get rid of terl . . . . . . and keep the gold for yourself .
but i' d never double cross you .
i' ve arranged that if any unfortunate accident were to befall me . . . . . . this would go straight to the home office .
double or nothing i can blow off one of its limbs .
that one does seem to be unusually intelligent and resourceful .
but it' s also defiant .
we' il need leverage over it .
leverage ?
over a man animal ?
man is a primitive species . . . . . . so we' il need something primitive for leverage .
like food .
what do you think a man animal would like to eat ?
what would he consider a treat ?
how the crap should i know ?
there' s no way of knowing that .
but before we educate it on the machine . . . . . . we' il take it to the mountains with a couple of the others .
let them think they' ve escaped . . . . . . and then we' il sit back and watch it choose its favorite food .
yes .
look !
three days , and they still haven' t eaten anything yet .
precisely .
now that the man animals feel . . . . . . that they have enough distance from us . . . . . . soon they' il find their favorite food and celebrate .
what is it ?
food .
food !
no spark , no flints , nothing .
you , floyd ?
plenty to burn .
nothing to start a fire with .
that' s their favorite .
of course it is .
they could' ve selected anything .
it' s not cooked .
if man animal prefers rat uncooked , then our job is that much easier .
if they like their rat so much , how come those two aren' t eating ?
don' t you know anything ?
the leader of the pack always eats first .
see ?
we' re really going to have leverage over them now .
what are you doing ?
they know about the camera .
don' t be a knot head .
it' s a man animal .
it couldn' t possibly know about it .
you sure called that one , sir .
no way they know about the cameras .
move your fat ass and let' s go round them up !
crap , lousy ceiling !
great .
this is great .
what do we do now ?
what are you thinking , jonnie ?
don' t even think about it .
you wouldn' t live the jump , jonnie .
you wouldn' t live the jump !
you can surrender and rot in those cages .
that' s your choice .
i' m not going back !
the monsters catch us , they' il take us to the mines .
run !
how do we know what he wants ?
they made me do this before .
follow me and you' il be fine .
don' t touch anything .
get them mad , think what they' il do to us .
excuse me , but i am your instructor . . . . . . if you' il forgive such arrogance . . .
. . . for i do not have the honor to be a psychlo .
i' m a lowly clinko language slave .
as you are listening to me , i most likely do not exist . . . . . . as we may have been exterminated like many other races . . . . . . by the gas drones of our conquerors .
please forgive my pretension . . . . . . as i try to educate you in psychlo . . . . . . the noble language of our superiors .
you understand ?
you understand me ?
are you hungry , little fella ?
yes ?
obviously , this is going to take a while .
jonnie !
jonnie !
carlo !
carlo !
i know who they are and where they' re from .
i can speak their language .
monsters ?
they' re called psychlos .
what did they do to him ?
they made him look into a light , a god machine .
it teaches .
it' s a knowledge machine .
it sends pictures through your head so fast , it' s spinning .
let' s go , jonnie .
come on .
no , i can' t .
i have to stay .
i have to learn more about them .
this may be our only way out of here .
so this is the monster' s language ?
no , no .
this is mathematics .
this is the unifying language of the entire universe .
look .
this symbol is called a triangle .
if all these sides are equal . . . . . . then these three angles must also be equal .
equal to what ?
to each other .
it' s the basic foundation of euclidean geometry .
seems pretty hard to understand .
no , only at first .
and then it becomes clear in your mind .
i learned molecular biology .
this is the symbol for water and engineering .
see , a wing , see ?
and line and form and artistic composition .
you see , this is a square , like a cage .
i thought we were supposed to be working on stuff to help us escape .
this will .
all this will .
jonnie .
jonnie .
human .
the security chief should secure the field vault . . . . . . with an eight digit combination code . . . . . . and do not use a personal or employee . . . . . . identification number .
what' s an identification number ?
there .
how many numbers is that ?
eight .
eight ?
eight .
it' s more clever than that .
the question is , how clever ?
try the numbers backwards .
look at this .
it' s a recording machine .
this is how he watches us .
stop !
chrissy , stop !
what if he' s not dead ?
hope is an admirable quality , but foolish isn' t .
i can' t give you permission to go and get killed .
i don' t need your permission .
i' m no longer a child .
do you want lunch ?
it' s obviously too much to ask a man animal . . . . . . to learn a language as sophisticated as psychlo .
what if it can understand and it' s pretending it can' t ?
what the hell for ?
i don' t know .
maybe it' s secretly listening , trying to get leverage over on us .
man animal getting leverage over a psychlo .
that' il be the day .
what if this one is particularly stupid ?
maybe we should train another one .
no time .
when they detect the gold . . . . . . the planetship will know what we' re doing .
we' il have to terminate the operation and cover our tracks .
it speaks psychlo .
go on , say something else .
you' il stay here as my prisoner . . . . . . while you , you go and get a transporter .
because you' ve learned psychlo doesn' t mean you are one .
follow my orders or i' il have you killed .
how exactly do you plan to do that ?
mickey , no !
mickey , no !
if any of you rat brains knew anything about firearms . . . . . . you would know that you never store loaded weapons .
you drop him now !
drop him or i won' t mine an ounce of your gold .
i' il have you vaporized and find someone else to mine it .
you don' t have time .
you can' t hide this from home office forever .
a man getting leverage over a psychlo .
that' il be the day .
i think it' s time that we show our little friend a thing or two .
as long as you cling to the feeble hope . . . . . . that you' il ever get the better of me . . . . . . you' il be distracted from more important things .
when we attacked your planet . . . . . . all your soldiers and all their advanced technology . . . . . . could only put up a nine minute fight . . . . . . before they were exterminated .
which is why man is an endangered species .
everything you humans knew is here .
you can look at anything you want . . . . . . because there is nothing that will help you .
satisfied ?
yes .
i have one more demonstration for you and your friends .
you will be relocated to a new mining site .
if any of you get any bright ideas about escaping . . . . . . keep in mind that although you know nothing about firearms , i do .
i graduated top marksman in my class .
i can kill any of you at 1 000 paces .
tell them what i said .
we try to run , he' il kill us .
that' s it ?
yes .
allow me to demonstrate .
no !
wait !
let' s give this demon what it deserves .
kill it , i say !
destroy it !
shoot !
shoot !
why wait ?
kill it !
kill it .
then we' il run .
then what ?
what kind of life is it to run ?
living in fear of being hunted ?
what about those we' re leaving behind ?
there' s nothing we can do .
only the gods can free them .
you think the lights in the sky are gods waiting to save us ?
do you ?
those are planets , planets like this one .
the great villages were built by us .
by men and women just like us .
their freedom !
do you think no one has tried ?
you can' t defeat them .
that is our fate .
yes , we can .
yes , we can !
but we have to go back .
we go back and learn about their weapons .
our race is slowly dying and will be gone forever .
let it be said that we took this one chance and fought !
are you with me ?
are you with me ? !
we fight !
if you' re fighting the beast , me and my men are with you .
thank you .
it' s good to have friends out here .
may the gods be with you .
one as wise as you has ways to stop me from shooting .
i know if i' d tried , you would' ve killed me first .
damn right , rat brain !
that' s the first intelligent thing you' ve said .
rest break is over .
there' s something i need you to see so you' re properly motivated .
you don' t know her ?
no , i don' t know her .
she' s one of the foulest looking females i' ve ever seen .
while i tend to agree . . . . . . it' s obvious that you show a lack of aptitude for strategic deception .
on the other hand , what you show marginal proficiency at is . . .
. . . drawing .
this was found when she was collected .
the collar has enough explosives to remove her head from her body .
and this remote . . . . . . will activate it from anywhere on the planet .
so if you disobey me , let me show you what will happen .
please don' t harm her .
i believe you .
don' t worry , rat brain .
every collar has its own frequency .
i' m not going to blow up your little female friend .
just . . .
. . . this one .
you made your point .
i said i would mine your gold .
please don' t kill him .
please .
fine .
due to our new working relationship , i will grant you this one request .
i won' t kill him .
but you may never ask of me anything again .
i promise .
as i' ve said , i won' t kill him .
yes , sir .
stupid humans .
no , no , no .
what you did was right .
it was right for all of us .
greener , you' re a thinker . . . . . . and the gods respect thinkers .
you didn' t kill sammy .
jonnie , this is not living .
this is . . . . . . cages !
cages !
even if we escaped and went back to where we all came from . . . . . . it' d be like you said .
we' d be waiting for the psychlos to hunt us down .
i think that is not living either .
we all chose to fight .
count us in too !
what' s going on ?
someone knows how to speak the psychlo' s language .
he' s gonna help us fight .
yes .
ker , i' d like you to meet chirk .
she' s . . . .
his soon to be newly acquired secretary .
yes .
really ?
she' s stupid enough not to be a menace , pretty enough to be decorative .
she gets drunk with economical speed and has other advantages .
i can see that .
don' t you have some work to do ?
no .
ker ?
all right , sir .
now , listen , missy . . . . . . i' m still waiting for the planetship' s accounts .
i had to go way beyond the call of duty to get these .
i see .
well , that' s why i especially chose you .
so you' il keep your side of the bargain ?
which was ?
you said we' d have a huge house when we go back to psychlo next year .
we' re going to be rich , right ?
right .
i am going to make you as happy as a baby psychlo . . . . . . on a straight diet of kerbango .
well , isn' t it interesting . . . . . . that you have been keeping two sets of books . . . . . . and telling all the workers . . . . . . that the planet has been operating at a loss ?
i only claimed that it was running at a loss . . . . . . to try and motivate them all to work harder .
oh , yes , of course .
and it had nothing to do with the fact . . . . . . that it allowed you to cut the workers ' pay . . . . . . and keep all the extra credit for yourself .
did it ?
that .
well , i can explain that .
well , unfortunately , the company requires me to vaporize you .
on the other hand . . . . . . i could understand someone in your situation . . . . . . being old and having no future . . . . . . coming up with ways to solve your financial problems .
you can ?
oh , yes .
it' s really of no interest to anybody . . . . . . to have you not be planetship .
but it would be prudent of you to start to share your authority .
but these forms are all blank , undated .
you could put anything you wanted on them .
you would run the entire planet !
i would be nothing but a puppet .
well , if you don' t want to do it that way . . . . . . we could always do it by . . .
. . . the book .
what the hell does the planetship need with all this mining equipment ?
that' s not even the crazy part .
he' s ordered me to take a group of man animals to a remote area . . . . . . with the equipment to see if they can be trained to mine .
man animals being able to mine ?
yes .
old psychlo' s gone completely insane .
indeed .
but what can i do ?
an order is an order .
you have a busy day , rat brain .
first , learning how to fly . . . . . . then on to the learning machine for mining techniques .
crash one more time . . . . . . and your little friend will no longer be among the living .
again .
again !
never underestimate what a little leverage can do , rat brain .
that' s good , man animal .
this is the lever where we mine the gold !
lever !
up , down !
external sensors indicate dangerous radiation levels ahead .
this is as far as i can go !
land it !
meet me back here in 1 4 days .
i want the ship' s cage half filled with gold .
and even though i won' t be at the mining site . . .
. . . i' il be watching you .
how' s your side ?
it' s good .
good .
next time , you fly .
no , no , no .
even if we do mine enough gold . . . . . . we' il be lucky to fill half of that cage in time .
that' s why we' re not mining .
what about the big uglies watching us with that eye in the sky ?
carlo , look .
here' s the men , right ?
we split them in half .
one group goes . . . . . . and one group stays . . . . . . and it looks as if we' re still working .
but if we don' t deliver it in 1 4 days to terl , he' s just gonna kill us .
there' s a place called fort knox where the gold' s already been mined .
listen , there will be no mining , but we' il deliver it .
okay , so we have to pretend that we' re mining the gold .
we have to figure out where we' re gonna get the gold . . . . . . then we have to get the supplies to help our revolt .
yeah .
we barely have men to do one of those things . . . . . . iet alone all three .
it' s good to have friends on the outside !
come on !
if you two kept your eyes open , that' d be a great help .
look for an ocean .
if you see any , we' ve gone too far .
i think this is it .
i think we' re in washington .
we' re still in colorado .
that' s impossible .
i' ve been watching , we haven' t crossed this line .
you' re not paying attention .
let him navigate and watch me .
you' re gonna fly on the way back .
we couldn' t have crossed all these lines .
well , we did .
the lines must have faded over time .
this great village was the capital for all our tribes .
this is where our people' s history was buried .
here .
when the psychlos attacked earth . . . . . . they sent out flying gas drones .
our ancestors must' ve made it out into these remote radiated areas . . . . . . and the only reason they survived was because radiation is . . . . . . iethal to the psychlos .
and that was not good for them .
that' s good for us .
even if we fail , the people will be safe if they stay
safe from being hunted . . . . . . but radiation is also poisonous for humans .
so , you see , either way . . . . . . if we don' t take back our planet . . .
. . . the last of humanity becomes extinct .
based on what i' ve read about psychlo security . . . . . . if we revolted . . . . . . only using weapons they don' t perceive as any real threat . . . . . . if we just use rocks and sticks . . . . . . they' il just throw us back in the cages .
but . . . . . . we' re gonna stage this revolt inside the dome .
so the psychlos are gonna have to come inside the city to round us up .
and that is when we blow the dome .
carlo' s gonna blow the dome .
they won' t have masks .
they can' t breathe .
they die .
carlo ?
i' m gonna blow the dome ?
you' re gonna blow the dome .
piece of cake .
piece of cake , piece of cake .
but remember , as soon as we blow the dome . . . . . . boom , stage 2 alarm .
what is that ?
thousands of gas drones and troops will be teleported here .
we can' t fight against that .
then what' s the point ?
if they send more monsters to earth , we get wiped out .
well , the point is , we don' t let it get to stage 2 .
we' il destroy their home planet before it happens .
their home planet ?
their home planet .
we need some extra supplies before we can do that .
our first stop is a radiation bomb storage bunker .
is everyone clear ?
count us in .
look .
flying machines .
these are flying machines .
they' re weapons of some kind .
flying spears .
i think there' s a little more to it than that .
it' s a learning machine .
teach us to fly .
you' re right .
it' s like breaking a horse .
can you teach your men to fly this ?
piece of cake , piece of cake .
piece of cake .
try and keep it level .
jonnie !
what is it ?
i think i found one .
come on !
nuclear firebomb !
piece of cake .
according to the book , there' s a firing mechanism . . . . . . that has to be in place before it' s operational .
don' t touch the auto sensor .
what happens if we do ?
the bomb will explode .
big fire .
look .
greeners from this cave .
off .
off .
war
ning .
warning .
warning .
warning .
warning .
get it ?
what does the auto sensor look like ?
there' s an illustration in appendix a.
what ?
what ?
we don' t have appendix a.
more books , jonnie .
it' s okay .
i thought you said nuclear fires were powerful ?
it' s not nuclear .
mickey !
sorry .
you' re sorry .
mickey !
stop touching things and turn off the damn light .
leave it on .
look .
good work , mickey .
you just found appendix a.
will this be enough to blow up their whole planet ?
radiation reacts with their planet' s atmosphere .
there' s enough to destroy it forever .
let me do it .
let me go there and detonate the weapon .
it' s brave of you , mickey , but it' s my plan , so i go .
you' re the only one who speaks the monsters ' language .
you know things about them !
listen . . . . . . without you leading this revolt . . .
. . . we might not succeed .
i hope their eye in the sky didn' t see the gold through the lead walls .
start filling the cage .
we' il hide half and deliver the other half to terl tonight .
why is it in bars ?
i assumed , sir . . . . . . that a psychlo of your refinement wouldn' t want raw ore .
really ?
since you have had extra time . . . . . . to smelt it into bricks . . . . . . i' il expect the rest of the gold in seven days .
he has no intention of sharing that gold with you .
what the hell are you talking about ?
why are you here ?
you should be mining the gold !
you really think the only reason he made that recording . . . . . . was to have you as his patsy ?
do you , ker ?
no .
he has leverage over you . . . . . . and it' il guarantee you never see an ounce .
how do you know about those recordings ?
it really is amazing . . . . . . the collection of discs you find in terl' s personal vault .
first , we trade .
the disc  i don' t think so !
because if you don' t give me the disc now . . . . . . i will blow your head off .
you want to trade ?
let' s trade .
hooray !
won' t the psychlo see i' m not wearing the collar ?
after tonight , won' t matter much either way .
jonnie , i know you don' t believe in fate . . . . . . but i' ve always known this was your destiny .
this is our destiny .
it' s freedom for all of us .
for our children .
children ?
beautiful .
quickly !
what if this one is particularly stupid ?
there' s no time .
when they detect the gold ... ... the planetship will know what we' re doing .
we' il have to terminate the operation and cover our tracks .
when they detect the gold , the planetship will know what we' re doing .
we' il have to terminate the operation and cover our tracks .
i' ve been thinking .
80/ 20 is a pretty fair distribution of the gold .
but i should get the 80 % .
and with my share , i' m gonna fire all my wives . . . . . . and buy new ones .
maybe pretty ones this time .
ker bango !
congratulations .
you' ve learned how to get leverage over someone , haven' t you ?
which means i haven' t wasted my time training you , have l ?
you' re not upset ?
don' t be crazy .
you know how long i' ve waited for this day ?
i know the perfect way to celebrate .
what are you doing ?
you can' t shoot me .
i made a copy and gave it to someone for safekeeping .
you are just too good of a teacher .
how about giving your old teacher a clue as to who this might be ?
you insult yourself , sir .
you taught me better .
how am i supposed to know who it is ?
i don' t know .
it could be anybody on this damn planet .
it could be a mechanic .
no .
it could be a concubine .
no , no .
it could be anybody in communications .
wrong !
i hate these things .
it' s like it' s a test i' m not prepared for .
well , hell , it could even be our friendly bartender !
please .
i made a mistake .
now , give me the original disc . . . . . . then meet me at the teleportation platform in two hours .
sir .
the control bunker' s to the right .
three guards left .
two from the guardhouse , one coming from the north .
i' il take the guardhouse .
jonnie , the shooting' s triggered the alarm .
five guards from the south , heavily armed and moving fast .
between you and the bunker .
jonnie !
the man animals have escaped .
they' re running into the city .
send some guards out and round them up .
i' m busy .
don' t bother me with every little detail .
gotta round them up .
psychlos !
psychlos !
7 7 3 .
greener ?
carlo .

greener ?
what' s going on ?

it' s carlo .
what' s going on ?

if i don' t get mickey to psychlo , they' il send drones .
well , hurry up .
just hurry up , because i' ve got company .
here they are .
panther !

i' m right on his tail .
you know what you gotta do .
greener , come on .
i' ve gotta blow this dome now !
i' m teleporting mickey and the bomb .
hang on .
i' m seconds away .
jonnie , come on .
they' re destroying the bombs .
it' s now or never .
now !
now , go ahead !
blow the dome !
go !
go !
go !
teleportation sequence terminated .
interrupting something ?
jonnie ?
jonnie ?
why isn' t it coming down ?
the dome is holding !
it' s not working .
it' s only cracked !
the dome isn ' t broken .
we can ' t hold out long .
attention !
this is terl , your chief of security .
exterminate all man animals at will .
and happy hunting !
run !
run !
what' s with the dome ?
hold on , i' m taking it out now .
help us !
they' re killing us !
we' re not gonna make it !
i think we should pull out !
i' m blowing the dome .
in five .
four .
three .
two .
one .
piece of cake .
everyone on the ground now !
go !
teleportation sequence activated .
teleportation sequence activated .
psychlo war center , this is a stage 3 alert !
i repeat , a stage 3 alert .
initiate the gas drone extermination sequence .
you have been quite a challenge , rat brain .
you' il make a hell of a conversation piece . . . . . . when you' re stuffed and hanging on the academy wall .
where' s the rest of my gold ?
i' il exchange it for my woman' s life .
my life is over , but hers is of no consequence to you .
thanks for reminding me , rat brain .
now , where is it ?
trust me , you don' t want to do that .
trust me , there' s nothing i want more .
carlo came through .
why don' t you vaporize me ?
leverage .
if there are other psychlo colonies out there . . . . . . they' il send out gas drones and exterminate us .
but if they learn that it was your greed . . . . . . that destroyed their home planet . . .
. . . then all the credits in the universe . . . . . . won' t equal the bounty on your head .
but there is one thing you rat brains weren' t smart enough to realize .
kill them .
i fixed the problem with it .
it works now .
you imbecile !
what kind of game are you playing ?
since i' m teaching them our technology , they made me the head psychlo .
look at the bright side .
you may not be wallowing in luxury on psychlo . . .
. . . but at least you finally got your gold .
