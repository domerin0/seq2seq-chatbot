black jacket ?

they just came in .
something' s getting ready to go down .

what' s going on ?
i' il check out this asshole at the bar .
billy will make sure i behave .

phil !

police .

don' t move !
turn over !
way to go , rosewood .
you' re some cop .
you know that ?
sorry for the disturbance , folks .
everything' s under control .
taggart .
would you explain why you and rosewood were in a strip bar out of our jurisdiction while you were on duty ?
before you chastise these officers , there' s something you should know .
the only reason they were at a strip bar is because they were tailing me .
they were outside wondering what i was doing .
i was in having a good time .
i' m into those things .
these guys waited outside and the only reason they came in was because they saw two men with bulges in their jackets going in .
well , these guys were going to commit a robbery .
they watched them , waited for them to make their move , then foiled a crime .
i did not know what was going on .
i' m freaked out .
they must have a sixth sense .
i don' t know what you teach them , but they' re not just regular cops .
they' re supercops .
the only thing missing on these guys are capes .
ls this what really happened ?
no , sir .
would someone tell me what happened ?
well ...
foley invited us to this bar .
we accepted .
we ordered club sodas , sir .
right .
and while we were there ,
foley observed the two suspects casing the establishment .
and before we knew what was going on , he' d already disarmed one of them .
detective foley deserves all the credit for the arrests , sir .
detective foley , we appreciate your assistance , but if you want to practise law enforcement ,
i would prefer you did it in detroit .
i understand .
i' m sorry .
but before i go i want you two to know , the supercops story was working .
ok ?
it was working and you guys just messed it up .
i' m trying to figure you guys out , but i haven' t yet .
but it' s cool .
just fuck up a perfectly good lie and it' s all right .
you guys are off the case .
foster , mccabe , your turn .
don' t lose him .
not a chance , sir .
and you two ...
ln my office .
morning , gentlemen .
coffee and doughnuts ?
what ?
coffee and doughnuts .
there he is .
morning , officers .
you the second team ?
we' re the first team .
we won' t fall for a banana in the tailpipe .
you won' t fall for the banana in the tailpipe ?
it should be more natural , brother , like this .
i ain' t falling for no banana in my tailpipe . " it' s more natural for us .
you' ve been hanging out with this dude too long .
i' m sorry , i' m just fucking with you .
that' s funny to me .
you gonna try to keep up with me ?
no problem .
lsn' t this victor maitland' s house ?
yeah , i think so .
i' ve seen enough .
you want something to drink ?
i got some stuff in the trunk .
excuse me .
for a man on vacation , you look like you' re on a stakeout .
stakeout ?
no , no .
i' m picnicking .
this is a picnic area .
i' ve been shooting the shit long enough .
time for me to take in some sights .
excuse me .
what the hell' s he doing ?
can you put this in a good spot ?
this shit happened last time i parked here .
may i help you ?
i' m looking for victor maitland .
you realise that this is a members only club ?
i have to talk to victor .
it' s very important .
victor maitland , are you sure ?
yes .
grey haired gentleman .
very dark skin .
capricorn .
why don' t you give me the message and i' il take it to him ?
ok .
tell victor that ramon , the fella he met about a week ago ...
tell him that ramon went to the clinic , and i found out that i have ... herpes simplex 10 .
i think victor should check himself out with his physician before things start falling off on the man .
perhaps you better tell him that .
i think that would be best .
so do l .
hi , victor .
i' m back .
look , guys , don' t even try it .
why don' t you get the hell out of here ?
get the fuck away from me , man .
very good , victor .
could you teach him to roll over and sit , too ?
what do you want ?
i wanna talk to you .
last time , i didn' t get the chance .
i' ve nothing to say to you .
that' s cool , i' il do all the talking .
this is a very nice place , vic .
hi .
i like this .
this is nice .
glad you like it .
i must make you a member .
victor , i know that you' re into a lot of crooked shit .
and i have a pretty good idea that you had mikey killed .
and when i find out for sure ,
i' m going to fuck you up real bad .
ls that so ?
now listen to me , my tough little friend .
i don' t know from under what stone you crawled or where you get these ridiculous ideas about me , but it seems painfully obvious you haven' t the slightest fucking idea who you' re dealing with .
now , my advice to you is crawl back to your little stone in detroit before you get squashed , ok ?
please step away from the table .
gotta go now , vic .
nice meeting you again .
yeah .
catch you later , vic .
i can' t wait .
don' t i know you guys ?
you look so familiar .
detective foley , this is becoming very irritating .
why are you bothering victor maitland ?
i had a friend , michael tandino , who used to work for him .
maitland had him killed .
when i can prove it you' il be the first to know .
forget what you can prove , talk to me .
ok .
listen .
everybody knows victor maitland is a hotshot art dealer .
but i poked around .
art' s not the only thing he deals .
i saw some guys in his warehouse unloading a crate of german bearer bonds .
michael tandino had bonds like this on him , coincidentally , when he was killed .
just because maitland invests in the same bonds doesn' t mean he' s a killer .
the man' s not an investor , he' s a smuggler , be it bonds , drugs or whatever .
the crate i saw didn' t even pass through customs .
maitland is paying to get his shipments out before they' re inspected .
when his guys get it , they take the drugs or bonds out of the crates and they send it back before customs even knows what' s going on .
and you witnessed this ?
everything except for the drugs .
but i found coffee grounds everywhere .
coffee grounds ?
what does that mean ?
drugs are packed in coffee .
the scent throws off the dogs .
very good .
now what do we do ?
look , detective foley , i ...
i' m sorry .
i' d really like to help you .
lf you' d found the drugs , that' s one thing , but if your only evidence is coffee , we can' t get a search warrant .
we can get around that .
we don' t " get around " search warrants .
taggart , i want you to start checking this out .
start with the lapd , the fbl and the customs service .
wait a minute .
maitland is much smarter than that .
we snoop around , he' il close down and get his shipments from elsewhere .
really ? ls that what your extensive experience tells you ?
i haven' t been on the force ...
shit .
ls this the man ?
yes , sir .
the gentleman that crashed through victor maitland' s window ?
who disabled an unmarked unit with a banana ?
yes , sir .
who lured taggart and rosemont into a gross dereliction of duty at a striptease establishment ?
it' s rosewood , sir .
yes , sir .
ls this the gentleman who ruined the buffet at the harrow club today ?
yes , sir .
i just bet you are the pride of your department in detroit .
lieutenant , i' d like to see you in your office .
yes , sir .
ls this the man who wrecked the buffet at the harrow club today ?
lower your voice .
can he hear me through the wall ?
yes , he can .
rosewood , take detective foley back to his hotel room , watch him pack , and escort him to the city limits .
then you can give him his gun back .
the two charges of disturbing the peace have been dropped against you .
but if you return to beverly hills , the charges will be reinstated and you will be prosecuted to the limit of the law .
sir , may i say something ?
what ?
he seems to have enough ...
you want to tell that to the chief ?
no , sir .
then i suggest you get moving .
come on , axel .
right .
let me check on that tomorrow and get back to you .
thank you .
hi .
victor , hi .
sit down .
i' m not interrupting ?
of course not .
there' s a gentleman in town from detroit who says he' s a friend of michael tandino .
he came by the office yesterday and asked me all sorts of odd questions .
excuse me , darling .
i believe his name is foley .
since you were a friend of michael ,
i was wondering if you knew the fellow .
we grew up in the same neighbourhood .
really ?
have you seen him lately ?
he came in yesterday .
what ?
he came by here ?
and ?
he told me that mikey had been killed .
yes .
yes , i know .
and then ?
that' s it .
he left and i haven' t seen him since .
jenny , darling , do you know where he' s staying ?
i have some information which might be helpful for him .
no , i have no idea .
i hope i didn' t disturb you .
no problem .
we' il have dinner soon , yes ?
that' d be lovely .
take care .
i read the manifests .
they' re expecting another shipment in today .
bogomil ...
this is a chance for me and you to blow this case wide open .
i wish i could , but i can' t .
why ?
because bogomil would kill me .
i' m not going to drive you to the art gallery .
it' s easy .
jenny will let us in maitland' s warehouse .
the shipment arrives , we nail them .
how can you be sure it' il be drugs ?
i got a hunch .
a technique by which many crimes outside beverly hills get solved .
why didn' t you tell bogomil about this shipment ?
he does everything by the book .
ls everybody in this town a robot ?
this thing is very personal to me .
all he asked me to do was drive you out of town .
now i' m going to screw that up , too .
billy , i love you .
i just fell in love with you .
jenny , how are you ?
this is my buddy billy rosewood .
jenny summers .
billy' s a beverly hills cop .
how do you do ?
that' s serge .
can you get my friend an espresso ?
you want it with a lemon twist ?
sure , if it' s no bother .
no , don' t be stupid .
victor maitland was here asking questions about you today .
he was acting real weird .
look , i want to get back inside the warehouse .
how about i go with you ?
you work in a gallery .
you' re not a cop .
lf this has to do with mikey' s death , i want to check it out .
i don' t have time to argue with you .
let me get my keys and we' il argue on the way .
billy , you sit here and observe .
don' t move till i get you .
why can' t i come in ?
cos you' re a cop in this town .
without probable cause , it' s an illegal search .
didn' t they teach you that in cop school ?
i find some evidence , i' il get you .
you can' t ...
be cool , all right ? lf anything jumps off , i' il come and get you .
ls there any chance you' il let me go in by myself ?
no chance .
fuck .
come on .
seems they' ve been already .
what are you looking for ?
this .
a crate from overseas that hasn' t passed through customs yet .
what is that ?
coffee ?
yeah , it' s coffee on top .
but this ain' t sugar .
go get rosewood .
welcome to the party .
it seems we have guests .
how nice .
i do like surprises .
jeannette .
i just can' t tell you how disappointed i am to find you here .
shut up !
i don' t want to hear it .
take her to the car and wait for me .
what are you going to do with him ?
you should be more worried about what we' re going to do with you .
don' t worry .
we' ve got cocaine and coffee , we' re going to have a party .
thanks for having me over , vic .
this is very nice .
did you say something ?
lf something happens to her ...
i' m all ears .
i' il kill you .
really ?
that would be a neat trick .
well , cuz .
are you still pissed at me ?
no .
but i should have taken care of you in detroit .
when i popped your little buddy .
goodbye , mr foley .
have a nice day .
i' il try .
damn it .
oh , boy .
how' s that little bump on the head i gave you in detroit ?
healed up nice , i hope .
freeze !
thanks .
tell taggart to check out the warehouse .
i' il explain later .
sergeant taggart is here , he wants to talk to you .
shit !
billy , what the hell is going on ?
sorry , sarge , i can' t talk now .
what do you mean ?
just check out the warehouse and please don' t say anything to bogomil .
he' s not transmitting any more .
shit .
what' s the matter ?
billy' s doing something dumb again .
was he calling from the hotel ?
no , sir .
right now , his car' s heading north on palm canyon road .
we were there this morning .
what ?
foley was looking over maitland' s house .
do you have that warehouse address ?
yes , sir .
check that place out , let me know what' s going on over there .
don' t talk to anybody but me .
hold it , foley .
you' re under arrest .
billy , why are you here ?
i forced him at gunpoint .
no , he didn' t .
everything he said about maitland is right .
he' s kidnapped a woman .
let' s get her .
what do you think i' m doing ?
we' il have a warrant in 20 minutes .
she could be dead in 20 minutes .
stop .
you' re coming with us .
i' m going inside .
you want to stop me , shoot me .
me , too .
you can do what you want , but i' m going in .
this is really serious trouble .
lf you' re lucky , you' il just get fired .

this is my last warning .
i' m sorry , sarge .

well , he isn' t actually in custody , sir .
place him in custody .
or would you like me to ?
wouldn' t you like to hear my report first , sir ?
you have a report that explains all this ?
yes , sir .
well , i will be very glad to hear it .
miss jeannette summers , the manager of mr maitland' s art gallery , accidentally discovered what she suspected was cocaine in the gallery' s warehouse .
she immediately communicated her discovery to detective axel foley .
detective foley was , at the time , cooperating in a joint beverly hills detroit investigation .
detectives foley and rosewood proceeded to the warehouse where rosewood discovered approximately 80 kilos of cocaine .
rosewood called for back up and i despatched our officers .
sergeant taggart was the first on the scene .
believing a felony was in progress , sergeant taggart joined rosewood , with detective foley present only as an observer , and proceeded to enter the grounds .
ln defending ourselves , we shot several suspects , including mr maitland .
you expect me to believe that report ?
that' s the report i' m filing , sir .
sergeant taggart , why don' t you tell me what happened ?
happened just like the lieutenant said , chief .
well , i suppose congratulations are in order .
thank you , sir .
that report better be on my desk in the morning .
yes , sir .
first thing .
you were lying your ass off .
go to the hospital and get your shoulder looked at .
excuse me , sir .
could you do me a favour , sir ?
your favours are all used up .
i understand .
i just hoped you could call lnspector todd and straighten things out for me , but that' s all right .
i' m out of a job .
it' s cool .
i think i' il stay in beverly hills .
i' m going to start a private investigation company .
i' il talk to todd first thing .
really ?
you bet .
thank you so much .
hi , i' m axel foley checking out of suite 1035 .
one moment , sir .
i' il get your bill .
guys , you didn' t have to come to see me off , but i' m very moved .
bogomil ordered us to make sure you got out of town .
that doesn' t matter .
what matters is that you came down here .
i' m all choked up .
i' ve got a lump in my throat .
look a little misty yourself , taggart .
there you go , sir .
thank you .
excuse me , the beverly hills police department is picking that up .
get outta here .
guys , that' s the last straw .
you guys are too nice .
do you sell those beverly palm robes ?
yes , sir . $95 apiece .
put them on my tab .
i have to have two of them , though .
billy , you saved my life .
i' il never be able to repay you , but as a token of my appreciation ,
i want you to have this fine beverly palm robe .
each time you get in the shower , think about our friendship .
think about axel foley .
i love you , billy .
thanks , axel .
here , let me take this .
you should rest that arm .
billy , take care of the tab .
taggart ...
here you are , sir .
this is for you .
no , that' s all right .
you keep it as a souvenir .
i already have three of them in my bag .
thank you , sir .
not going to say goodbye ?
aren' t you tailing me to the city limits ?
yes , we are .
i figured you would .
i was thinking about stopping for a drink .
we figured you would .
then will you join me ?
i don' t think so , axel .
we' re still on duty .
i don' t think one beer' s going to kill us , billy .
right .
listen to taggart .
lighten up .
one drink' s not going to kill us .
but guys , if you fall too far behind , don' t be afraid to honk , ok ?
where we going , anyway ?
don' t worry , just follow my lead .
i know the perfect place .
you guys' il love it .
trust me .
