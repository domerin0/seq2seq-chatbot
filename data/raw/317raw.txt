people are always asking me if i know tyler durden .
3 minutes .
3 minutes .
this is it : ground zero .
would you like to say a few words to mark the occasion ?
with a gun barrel between your teeth , you speak only in vowels .
i can' t think of anything .
for a second i totally forget about tyler' s whole controlled demolition thing , and i wonder how clean that gun is .
getting exciting now .
that old saying , how you always hurt the one you love ?
well , it works both ways .
we have front row seats for this theater of mass destruction .
the demolitions committee of project mayhem wrapped the foundation columns of a dozen buildings with blasting gelatin .
in 2 minutes , primary charges will blow base charges and a few square blocks will be reduced to smoldering rubble .
i know this ... because tyler knows this .
2 1/ 2 .
think of everything we' ve accomplished .
and suddenly , i realize that all of this : the gun , the bombs , the revolution ... has got something to do with a girl named marla singer .
bob .
bob had bitch tits .
this was a support group for men with testicular cancer .
the big moosey slobbering all over me , that was bob .
we' re still men .
yes , we' re men .
men is what we are .
8 months ago , bob' s testicles were removed .
then hormone therapy .
he developed bitch tits because his testosterone was too high , and his body upped the estrogen .
and that was where i fit ...
they' re gonna have to open up my pecs again and drain the fluid .
between those huge , sweating tits that hung enormous the way you' d think of god' s as big .
ok .
you cry now .
no , wait .
back up .
let me start earlier .
for 6 months , i couldn' t sleep .
i couldn' t sleep .
i couldn' t sleep .
with insomnia , nothing' s real .
everything' s far away .
everything' s a copy of a copy of a copy .
when deep space exploration ramps up , it' il be the corporations that name everything : the i. b. m. stellarsphere , the microsoft galaxy ,
planet starbucks .
gonna need you out of town a little more this week .
we got some red flags to cover .
it must' ve been tuesday .
he was wearing his cornflower blue tie .
you want me to deprioritize my current reports until you advise of a status upgrade ?
make these your primary action items .
here' s your flight coupons .
call me from the road if there' s any snags .
he was full of pep .
must have had his grand latt enema .
like so many others , i had become a slave to the ikea nesting instinct .
uh , yes .
i' d like to order the erica pekkary dust ruffles .
please hold .
if i saw something clever
like a little coffee table in the shape of a yin yang ,
i had to have it .
the klipske personal office unit , the hovetrekke home exer bike , or the johannshamn sofa with the strinne green stripe pattern .
even the rizlampa wire lamps of environmentally friendly unbleached paper .
what kind of dining set defines me as a person ?
i had it all .
even the glass dishes with tiny bubbles and imperfections .
proof that they were crafted by the honest , simple , hard working indigenous peoples of
please hold .
wherever .
i was holding .
we used to read pornography .
now it was the horchow collection .
no , you can' t die from insomnia .
what about narcolepsy ?
i nod off .
i wake up in strange places .
i have no idea how i got there .
you need to lighten up .
can you please just get me something ?
red and blue tuenols , lipstick red seconals .
no .
you need healthy natural sleep .
chew some valerian root and get more exercise .
hey , come on .
i' m in pain .
you wanna see pain ?
swing by first methodist tuesday nights .
see the guys with testicular cancer .
that' s pain .
la la la
la la la la la la
i always wanted 3 kids , 2 boys and a girl .
mindy wanted 2 girls and a boy .
we never could agree on anything .
well , uh , you know , she
she had her first child last week , a ... a girl .
with with her , uh , with her new husband .
fuck .
hey hey , thank god , you know .
i' m i' m glad for her .
because she deserves it .
aw .
everyone , let' s thank thomas for sharing himself with us .
thank you , thomas .
i look around this room , and i see a lot of courage , and that gives me strength .
we give each other strength .
it' s time for the one on ones .
so let' s all of us here follow thomas ' good example and really open ourselves up .
would you find a partner ?
and this is how i met the big moosey ...
come on .
let' s go over here .
his eyes already shrink wrapped in tears ... knees together , those awkward little steps .
my name is bob .
bob .
bob had been a champion body builder .
you know that chest expansion program you see on late night tv ?
that was his idea .
i was a juicer .
you know , using steroids .
diabonal and ...
wistrol .
oh , they use that on racehorses , for christ sakes .
and now i' m bankrupt .
i' m divorced .
my 2 grown kids ... won' t even return my phone calls .
strangers with this kind of honesty make me go a big rubbery one .
go ahead , cornelius .
you can cry .
and then , something happened .
i let go .
that' s really good .
lost in oblivion ... dark and silent and complete .
i found freedom .
losing all hope was freedom .
it' s ok .
babies don' t sleep this well .
i became addicted .
come on .
if i didn' t say anything ... people always assumed the worst .
welcome , travis .
welcome , travis .
they cried harder ... then i cried harder .
now we' re going to open the green door , the heart chakra .
i wasn' t really dying .
i wasn' t host to cancer or parasites .
i was the warm little center that the life of this world crowded around . that the life of this world crowded around .
imagine your pain as a white ball of healing light .
it moves over your body , healing you .
now , keep this going .
remember to breathe , and step forward through the back door of the room .
where does it lead ?
to your cave .
step forward into your cave .
that' s right .
you' re going deeper into your cave , and you' re going to find your power animal .
slide .
every evening , i died ... and every evening , i was born again .
resurrected .
bob loved me because he thought my testicles were removed , too .
being there ... pressed against his tits , ready to cry .
this was my vacation .
and she ruined everything .
this is cancer , right ?
this chick marla singer did not have testicular cancer .
she was a liar .
she had no diseases at all .
i had seen her at free and clear my blood parasites group thursdays .
then at hope , my bimonthly sickle cell circle .
and again at seize the day , my tuberculosis friday night .
marla , the big tourist .
her lie reflected my lie , and suddenly , i felt nothing .
i couldn' t cry .
so once again , i couldn' t sleep .
next group , after guided meditation , after we open our heart chakras , when it' s time to hug ,
i' m gonna grab that little bitch
marla singer and scream ...
marla , you liar !
you big tourist !
i need this !
now get out !
i hadn' t slept in 4 days .
absolutely .
we' il just let that dry .
when you have insomnia , you' re never really asleep ... and you' re never really awake .
to begin tonight' s communion ,
chloe would like to say a few words .
oh , yeah ...
chloe .
chloe looked the way
meryl streep' s skeleton would look if you made it smile and walk around the party being extra nice to everybody .
well , i' m still here , but i don' t know for how long .
that' s as much certainty as anyone can give me .
but i' ve got some good news .
i no longer have any fear of death .
but i am in a pretty lonely place .
no one will have sex with me .
i' m so close to the end , and all i want is to get laid for the last time .
i have pornographic movies in my apartment ,
and lubricants and amyl nitrate .
chloe ...
everyone , let' s thank chloe .
now , let' s ... ready ourself for guided meditation .
you' re standing at the entrance of your cave .
you step inside your cave , and you walk .
if i did have a tumor ...
i' d name it marla .
marla ... the little scratch on the roof of your mouth that would heal if only you could stop tonguing it , but you can' t . ... deeper into your cave as you walk .
you feel the healing energy of this place all around you .
now find your power animal .
slide .
ok .
now let' s partner up .
pick someone special to you tonight .
hey .
we need to talk .
sure .
i' m onto you .
what ?
yeah .
you' re a faker .
you' re not dying .
sorry ?
in the tibetan philosophy , sylvia plath sense of the word ,
i know we' re all we' re all dying , all right ?
but you' re not dying the way chloe back there is dying .
so ?
so you' re a tourist .
ok ?
i' ve seen you .
i saw you saw you at melanoma , saw you at tuberculosis ,
i saw you at testicular cancer .
i saw you practicing this .
practicing what ?
telling me off .
is it going as well as you hoped ...
rupert " ?
i' il expose you .
go ahead .
i' il expose you .
all right , come together .
let yourselves cry .
oh , god , why are you doing this ?
it' s cheaper than a movie , and there' s free coffee .
no , look ... this is important , ok ?
these are my groups .
i' ve been coming here for over a year .
why do you do it ?
i don' t know .
when people think you' re dying , man , they really , really listen to you instead of just ...
instead of just waiting for their turn to speak .
yeah .
yeah .
share yourself ... completely .
ok , you don' t want to get into this .
it becomes an addiction .
really ?
i' m not kidding .
i can' t cry if there' s another faker present , and i need this .
so you got to find somewhere else to go .
candy stripe a cancer ward .
it' s not my problem .
wait , wait , wait .
whoa .
hold on .
i' il tell you .
we' re gonna split up the week , ok ?
you take lymphoma and tuberculosis
you take tuberculosis .
my smoking doesn' t go over at all .
ok .
good .
fine .
testicular cancer should be no contest , i think .
well , technically ,
i have more right to be there than you .
you still have your balls .
you' re kidding .
i don' t know .
am i ?
no .
no .
what do you want ?
i' il take the parasites .
you can' t have both the parasites , but why don' t you take the blood parasites
i want brain parasites .
i' il take the blood parasites , but i' m gonna take the organic brain dementia
i want that .
you can' t have the whole brain .
so far you have 4 .
i only have 2 .
ok .
take both the parasites .
they' re yours .
now we both have 3 .
hey , you left half your clothes !
what , are you selling those ?
yes !
i' m selling some clothes .
so , we each have 3 .
that' s 6 .
what about the seventh day ?
i want ascending bowel cancer .
the girl had done her homework .
thank you .
no .
no , i ...
i want bowel cancer .
that' s your favorite , too ?
try to slip it by me , eh ?
look , we' re gonna split it , ok ?
take the first and third sunday of the month .
deal .
looks like this is good bye .
well , let' s not make a big thing out of it , ok ?
how' s this for not making a big thing ?
hey , marla !
marla !
may maybe we should exchange numbers .
should we ?
w we might want to switch nights .
ok .
this is how i met marla singer .
marla' s philosophy of life was that she might die at any moment .
the tragedy , she said , was that she didn' t .
it doesn' t have your name .
who are you ,
cornelius , rupert ,
travis , any of the stupid names you give each night ?
you wake up at seatac .
s. f. o ...
l. a. x ...
you wake up at o' hare ...
dallas fort worth ...
b. w. i ...
pacific , mountain , central ...
lose an hour , gain an hour ...
check in for that flight doesn' t begin for another 2 hours , sir .
this is your life , and it' s ending one minute at a time .
you wake up at air harbor international ...
p. a. : ... the aircraft has come to a complete stop .
if you wake up at a different time , in a different place , could you wake up as a different person ?
everywhere i travel , tiny life ... single serving sugar ... single serving cream ... single pat of butter ... a microwave cordon bleu hobby kit .
shampoo conditioner combos .
sample package mouthwash , tiny bars of soap .
the people i meet on each flight , they' re single serving friends .
between takeoff and landing , we have our time together , but that' s all we get .
welcome !
on a long enough timeline , the survival rate for everyone drops to zero .
i was a recall coordinator .
my job was to apply the formula .
here' s where the infant went through the windshield .
3 points .
a new car built by my company
leaves somewhere traveling at 60 miles per hour .
the rear differential locks up .
the teenager' s braces are wrapped around the back seat ashtray .
might make a good antismoking ad .
the car crashes and burns with everyone trapped inside .
now , should we initiate a recall ?
the father must' ve been huge .
you see where the fat has burned to the seat , the polyester shirt ?
very modern art .
ha ha ha !
take the number of vehicles in the field , " a , " multiply it by the probable rate of failure , " b , " then multiply the result by the average out of court settlement , " c.
a " times " b " times " c " equals " x.
if" x " is less than the cost of a recall , we don' t do one .
are there a lot of these kinds of accidents ?
you wouldn' t believe .
which car company do you work for ?
a major one .
every time the plane banked too sharply on takeoff or landing ,
i prayed for a crash or a midair collision .
anything .
life insurance pays off triple if you die on a business trip .
if you are seated in an emergency exit row ...
yeah ...
and you feel you would be unable or unwilling to perform the duties
listed on the safety card , please ask a flight attendant to reseat you .
it' s a lot of responsibility .
wanna switch seats ?
no .
i' m not sure i' m the man for that particular job .
an exit door procedure at 30, 000 feet .
mm hmm .
the illusion of safety .
yeah .
i guess so .
you know why they put oxygen masks on planes ?
so you can breathe .
oxygen gets you high .
in a catastrophic emergency , you' re taking giant panicked breaths .
suddenly you become euphoric , docile .
you accept your fate .
it' s all right here .
emergency water landing 600 miles an hour .
blank faces , calm as hindu cows .
that' s , um ...
that' s an interesting theory .
what do you do ?
what do you mean ?
what do you do for a living ?
why ?
so you can pretend like you' re interested ?
ok .
you have a kind of sick desperation in your laugh .
we have the exact same briefcase .
soap .
sorry ?
i make and i sell soap the yardstick of civilization .
and this is how i met ...
tyler durden .
did you know , if you mixed equal parts of gasoline and frozen orange juice concentrate , you can make napalm ?
no , i did not know that .
is that true ?
that' s right .
one can make all kinds of explosives using simple household items .
really ?
if one were so inclined .
tyler , you are , by far , the most interesting
single serving " friend i' ve ever met .
see , obviously , everything on a plane is single serving , even
oh , i get it .
it' s very clever .
thank you .
how' s that working out for you ?
what ?
being clever .
great .
keep it up , then .
right up .
now a question of etiquette .
as i pass , do i give you the ass or the crotch ?
how i came to live with tyler is ... airlines have this policy about vibrating luggage .
was was it ticking ?
actually , throwers don' t worry about ticking ,
' cause modern bombs don' t tick .
sorry .
throwers " ?
baggage handlers .
but when a suitcase vibrates , then the thrower' s gotta call the police .
my suitcase ... was vibrating ?
9 times out of 10 , it' s an electric razor , but every once in a while ...
it' s a dildo .
of course , it' s company policy never to imply ownership in the event of a dildo .
we have to use the indefinite article a dildo .
never your dildo .
i don' t own a
i had everything in that suitcase my ck shirts , my dkny shoes , my ax ties .
never mind .
hey !
that' s my car !
home was a condo on the 15th floor of a filing cabinet for widows and young professionals .
the walls were solid concrete .
a foot of concrete' s important when your next door neighbor lets her hearing aid go and has to watch game shows at full volume ...
or when a volcanic blast and debris that used to be your furniture and personal effects blows out of your floor to ceiling windows and sails flaming into the night .
i suppose these things happen .
there' s nothing up there .
you can' t go into the unit .
police orders .
do you have somebody you can call ?
how embarrassing .
a house full of condiments and no food .
the police would later tell me that the pilot light might have gone out ,
letting out just a little bit of gas .
that gas could have slowly filled the condo 1, 700 square feet of high ceilings for days and days .
then the refrigerator' s compressor could' ve clicked on .
yeah ?
i can hear you breathing , you
if you asked me now ,
i couldn' t tell you why i called him .
hello ?
who' s this ?
tyler ?
who is this ?
um , ahem , we met on the airplane .
we had the same suitcase .
uh , the clever guy .
oh , yeah .
right .
ok ?
i called a second ago .
there was no answer .
i' m at a pay phone .
yeah .
i star 69ed you .
i never pick up my phone .
so , what' s up , man ?
uh , well ... you' re not gonna believe this .
you know , man , it could be worse .
a woman could cut off your penis while you' re sleeping and toss it out the window of a moving car .
there' s always that .
i don' t know , it' s just ... when you buy furniture , you tell yourself , that' s it .
that' s the last sofa i' m gonna need .
whatever else happens ,
i' ve got that sofa problem handled .
i had it all .
i had a stereo that was very decent , a wardrobe that was getting very respectable .
i was close to being complete .
shit , man .
now it' s all gone .
all gone .
hmm .
all gone .
do you know what a duvet is ?
comforter .
it' s a blanket . just a blanket .
why do guys like you and i know what a duvet is ?
is this essential to our survival in the hunter gatherer sense of the word ?
no .
what are we , then ?
we' re , uh , you know , consumers ...
right .
we' re consumers .
we are by products of a lifestyle obsession .
murder , crime , poverty these things don' t concern me .
what concerns me are celebrity magazines , television with 500 channels , some guy' s name on my underwear .
rogaine , viagra , olestra .
martha stewart .
fuck martha stewart .
martha' s polishing the brass on the titanic .
it' s all going down , man .
so fuck off with your sofa units and strinne green stripe patterns .
i say , never be complete .
i say , stop being perfect .
i say , let' s ...
let' s evolve .
let the chips fall where they may .
but that' s me , and i could be wrong .
maybe it' s a terrible tragedy .
no .
it' s just stuff .
it' s not a tragedy , but ...
well , you did lose a lot of versatile solutions for modern living .
fuck .
you' re right .
no .
i don' t smoke .
my insurance is probably gonna cover it , so ...
what ?
the things you own end up owning you .
but do what you like , man .
oh , it' s late .
hey , thanks for the beer .
yeah , man .
i should find a hotel .
oh .
what ?
what ?
a hotel .
yeah . just ask , man .
what are you talking about ?
oh , god .
3 pitchers of beer , and you still can' t ask .
what ?
you called me ' cause you needed a place to stay .
oh , hey , no , no , no .
yes , you did .
so just ask .
cut the foreplay and just ask , man .
would that be a problem ?
is it a problem for you to ask ?
can i stay at your place ?
yeah .
thanks .
i want you to do me a favor .
yeah , sure .
i want you to hit me as hard as you can .
what ?
i want you to hit me as hard as you can .
let me tell you a little bit about tyler durden .
tyler was a night person .
while the rest of us were sleeping , he worked .
he had one part time job as a projectionist .
see , a movie doesn' t come all on one big reel .
it comes on a few .
so someone has to be there to switch the projectors at the exact moment that one reel ends and the next one begins .
if you look for it , you can see these little dots come into the upper right hand corner of the screen .
in the industry , we call them " cigarette burns .
that' s the cue for a changeover .
he flips the projectors , the movie keeps right on going , and nobody in the audience has any idea .
why would anyone want this shit job ?
because it affords him other interesting opportunities .
like splicing single frames of pornography into family films .
so when the snooty cat and the courageous dog with the celebrity voices meet for the first time in reel 3 , that' s when you' il catch a flash of tyler' s contribution to the film .
nobody knows that they saw it , but they did .
a nice big cock .
even a hummingbird couldn' t catch tyler at work .
tyler also works sometimes as a banquet waiter at the luxurious pressman hotel .
he was the guerilla terrorist of the food service industry .
do not watch .
i cannot go when you watch .
apart from seasoning the lobster bisque , he farted on meringues , sneezed on braised endive .
and as for the cream of mushroom soup , well ...
go ahead , tell them .
you get the idea .
what do you want me to do ?
you just want me to hit you ?
come on .
do me this one favor .
why ?
why ?
i don' t know why .
i don' t know .
i' ve never been in a fight .
have you ?
no , but that' s a good thing .
no , it is not .
how much can you know about yourself if you' ve never been in a fight ?
i don' t wanna die without any scars .
so , come on , hit me before i lose my nerve .
god , this is crazy .
so go crazy .
let ' er rip .
hey , i don' t know about this .
i don' t , either , but who gives a shit ?
no one' s watching .
what do you care ?
wait .
this is crazy .
you want me to hit you ?
that' s right .
what , like , in the face ?
surprise me .
this is so fucking stupid .
ohh !
motherfucker !
you hit me in the ear .
well , jesus , i' m sorry .
ow !
christ !
why the ear , man ?
aw , i fucked it up .
no .
that was perfect .
ohh !
uhh !
nah , it' s all right .
that really hurts .
right .
hit me again .
no .
you hit me .
come on .
we should do this again sometime .
where' s your car ?
what car ?
i don' t know how tyler found that house , but he said he' d been there for a year .
it looked like it was waiting to be torn down .
most of the windows were boarded up .
there was no lock on the front door from when the police or whoever kicked it in .
the stairs were ready to collapse .
i didn' t know if he owned it or if he was squatting .
neither would have surprised me .
yeah .
that' s you .
that' s me .
that' s the toilet .
good ?
yeah .
thanks .
what a shithole .
nothing worked .
turning on one light meant another light in the house went out .
there were no neighbors , just some warehouses and a paper mill that fart smell of steam , the hamster cage smell of wood chips .
after work tomorrow , we' il be
hey .
what have we here ?
hey , guys .
hey .
it' s cool .
ohh !
every time it rained , we had to kill the power .
by the end of the first month ,
i didn' t miss tv .
i didn' t even mind the warm , stale refrigerator .
can i be next ?
all right , man .
lose the tie .
ooh !
at night , tyler and i were alone for a half a mile in every direction .
rain trickled down through the plaster and the light fixtures .
everything wooden swelled and shrank .
everywhere were rusted nails to snag your elbow on .
the previous occupant had been a bit of a shut in .
hey , man , what are you reading ?
listen to this .
it' s an article written by an organ in the first person .
i am jack' s medulla oblongata .
without me , jack could not regulate his heart rate , blood pressure , or breathing .
there' s a whole series of these .
i am jill' s nipples .
i am jack' s colon .
yeah .
i get cancer .
i kill jack .
whoa ohh !
after fighting , everything else in your life got the volume turned down .
what ?
you could deal with anything .
have you finished those reports ?
if you could fight anyone , who would you fight ?
i' d fight my boss , probably .
really ?
yeah .
why , who would you fight ?
i' d fight my dad .
i don' t know my dad .
i mean , i know him , but he left when i was , like , 6 years old , married this other woman and had some other kids .
he , like , did this every 6 years .
he goes to a new city and starts a new family .
fucker should open up franchises .
my dad never went to college , so it was real important that i go .
that sounds familiar .
so i graduate , i call him up long distance .
i say , " dad , now what ?
he says , " get a job .
same here .
now i' m 25 .
i make my yearly call again .
i say , " dad , now what ?
he says , " i don' t know .
get married .
eh , i mean ...
i can' t get married .
i' m a 30 year old boy .
we' re a generation of men raised by women .
i' m wondering if another woman is really the answer we need .
most of the week , we were ozzie and harriet .
but every saturday night ,
but every saturday night , we were finding something out .
we were finding out more and more that we were not alone .
who turned the lights off ?
it used to be that when i came home angry or depressed ,
i' d just clean my condo , polish my scandinavian furniture .
i should' ve been looking for a new condo .
i should' ve been haggling with my insurance company .
i should' ve been upset about my nice , neat flaming little shit .
but i wasn' t .
the basic premise of cyber netting any office is make things more efficient .
monday mornings , all i could do was think about next week .
can i get the icon in cornflower blue ?
absolutely .
efficiency is priority number one , people , because waste is a thief .
i showed this already to my man , here .
you liked it , didn' t you ?
you can swallow a pint of blood before you get sick .
it was right in everyone' s face .
tyler and i just made it visible .
it was on the tip of everyone' s tongue .
tyler and i just gave it a name .
come on , people , you gotta go home .
turn off the jukebox .
lock the back .
every week , tyler gave the rules that he and i decided .
gentlemen , welcome to fight club .
the first rule of fight club is ... you do not talk about fight club .
the second rule of fight club is ... you do not talk about fight club .
third rule of fight club
someone yells " stop ! " goes limp , taps out , the fight is over .
fourth rule
only 2 guys to a fight .
fifth rule
one fight at a time , fellas .
sixth rule no shirts , no shoes .
seventh rule
fights will go on as long as they have to .
and the eighth and final rule
if this is your first night at fight club ... you have to fight .
this kid from work , ricky , couldn' t remember whether you ordered pens with blue ink or black ...
come on , man !
but ricky was a god for 10 minutes when the trounced the maitre d ' of a local food court .
sometimes , all you could hear were the flat , hard packing sounds over the yelling ...
or the wet choke when someone caught their breath and sprayed ...
stop !
you weren' t alive anywhere like you were there .
but fight club only exists in the hours between when fight club starts and when fight club ends .
even if i could tell someone they had a good fight ,
i wouldn' t be talking to the same man .
who you were in fight club is not who you were in the rest of the world .
the guy who came to fight club for the first time , his ass was a wad of cookie dough .
after a few weeks , he was carved out of wood .
if you could fight any celebrity , who would you fight ?
alive or dead ?
it doesn' t matter .
who' d be tough ?
hemingway .
you ?
shatner .
i' d fight william shatner .
we all started seeing things differently .
everywhere we went , we were sizing things up .
i felt sorry for guys packed into gyms , trying to look like how calvin klein or tommy hilfiger said they should .
is that what a man looks like ?
ahh .
self improvement is masturbation .
and self destruction .
excuse me .
kick his ass !
hit him again , man !
come on !
hit him !
fight club wasn' t about winning or losing .
it wasn' t about words .
the hysterical shouting was in tongues ,
like in a pentecostal church .
is that it ?
stop !
when the fight was over , nothing was solved , but nothing mattered .
hey , cool .
afterwards , we all felt saved .
hey , man , how about next week ?
how about next month ?
i hear you .
irwin , you' re in the middle .
new guy .
you , too .
sometimes , tyler spoke for me .
he fell down some stairs .
i fell down some stairs .
fight club became the reason to cut your hair short or trim your fingernails .
ok .
any historical figure .
i' d fight gandhi .
good answer .
how about you ?
lincoln .
lincoln ?
mm .
big guy , big reach .
skinny guys fight till they' re burger .
fuck .
hey .
even the mona lisa' s falling apart .
hello .
where have you been the last 8 weeks ?
marla ?
how' d you find me ?
you left that forwarding number .
i haven' t seen you in any support groups .
we split them up .
that was the idea , remember ?
yeah , but you haven' t been going to yours .
how do you know ?
i cheated .
i found a new one .
really ?
it' s for men only .
like the testicle thing ?
waaah !
look , this is a bad time .
i' ve been going to debtors anonymous .
you wanna see some really fucked up people ?
i' m just on my way out .
me , too .
i' ve got a stomachful of xanax .
i took what was left of a bottle .
it might have been too much .
just picture watching marla singer throw herself around her crummy apartment .
but this isn' t a for real suicide thing .
this is probably one of those cry for help things .
this could go on for hours .
so you' re staying in tonight , then ?
do you wanna wait and hear me describe death ?
do you wanna listen and see if my spirit can use a phone ?
have you ever heard a death rattle before ?
tyler' s door was closed .
i' d been living here for 2 months , and tyler' s door was never closed .
you won' t believe this dream i had last night .
yeah , i can hardly believe anything about last night .
what what are you doing here ?
what ?
this is my house .
what are you doing in my house ?
fuck you .
ha ha !
ohh ...
oh , you got some fucked up friends , i' m tellin ' you .
limber , though ... silly coos .
so , i come in last night .
phone' s off the hook .
guess who' s on the other end .
i already knew the story before he told it to me .
have you ever heard a death rattle before ?
do you think it' il live up to its name ?
or will it just be a death ... hairball ?
prepare ... to evacuate soul .
9 ... 8 ...
now , how could tyler , of all people , think it was a bad thing that marla singer was about to die ?
5 ... 4 ... 3 oh , hang on .
you got here fast .
did i call you ?
huh ?
hey .
the mattress is all sealed in slippery plastic .
oh , don' t worry .
it' s not a threat to you .
oh , fuck .
somebody called the cops .
hey , where' s 513 ?
end of the hall .
you know , the girl who lives there used to be a charming , lovely girl .
she' s lost faith in herself .
miss singer !
she' s a monster .
you have every reason to live !
she' s infectious human waste !
miss singer !
good luck trying to save her !
if i fall asleep , i' m done for .
you' re gonna have to keep me up ... all ... night .
un fucking believable .
he was obviously able to handle it .
you know what i mean .
you fucked her .
no , i didn' t .
never ?
no .
you' re not into her , are you ?
no !
god , not at all .
i am jack' s raging bile duct .
are you sure ?
you can tell me .
believe me , i' m sure .
put a gun to my head and paint the walls with my brains .
that' s good , ' cause she' s a predator posing as a house pet .
stay away from that one .
and the shit that came out of this woman' s mouth
i ain' t never heard .
my god .
i haven' t been fucked like that since grade school .
uhh !
how could tyler not go for that ?
the night before last , he was splicing sex organs into cinderella .
marla doesn' t need a lover .
she needs a fucking case worker .
she needs a wash .
and she' s in love with sport fuckin ' .
she invaded my support groups .
now she' d invaded my home .
hey , hey .
sit down .
now , listen .
can' t have you talking to her about me .
why would i talk to her
you say anything about me or what goes on in this house to her or to anybody , we' re done .
now , promise me .
ok .
you promise ?
yeah , i promise .
promise .
i just said i promise .
that' s 3 times you promised .
if only i had wasted a couple of minutes and gone to watch marla singer die , none of this would' ve happened .
unhh !
unhh !
unhh !
unhh !
yeah !
oh !
harder !
harder !
yeah !
ooh !
aah !
aah !
ohh !
aah !
i could' ve moved to another room ... on the third floor , where i might not have heard them .
oh , baby !
but i didn' t .
ohh !
ohh !
ohh !
ohh !
ohh !
ohh !
aaahh !
aah !
aah !
aah !
aah !
ohhh !
ohh !
ow !
ohh !
what are you doin ' ? just goin ' to bed .
want to finish her off ?
uhh ... oh !
no .
no , thank you .
i found the cigarettes .
who are you talking to ?
shut up .
i became the calm little center of the world .
i was the zen master .
ohh !
ohh !
ohh !
i wrote little haiku poems .
i e mailed them to everyone .
is that your blood ?
some of it , yeah .
you can' t smoke in here .
take the rest of the day off .
come back monday with some clean clothes .
get yourself together .
i got right in everyone' s hostile little face .
yes , these are bruises from fighting .
yes , i' m comfortable with that .
i ... am enlightened .
you give up the condo life ... give up all your flaming worldly possessions ... go live in a dilapidated house in a toxic waste part of town ... and you have to come home to this .
ohh !
ohh !
ohh !
ohh !
ohh !
ohh !
hello ?
yes .
this is detective stern with the arson unit .
we have some new information about the incident at your former condo .
yes ?
i don' t know if you' re aware , but it seems that someone sprayed freon into your front door lock , then tapped it with a chisel to shatter the cylinder .
no , i wasn' t aware of that at all .
i am jack' s cold sweat .
does this sound strange to you ?
uh , yes , sir .
strange .
very strange .
the dynamite
dynamite ?
left a residue of ammonium oxylate potassium chloride .
do you know what this means ?
no .
what does it mean ?
it means it was homemade .
i' m sorry .
this is just coming as quite a shock to me , sir .
see , whoever set this homemade dynamite could' ve blown out your pilot light days before the actual explosion .
the gas was just the detonator .
who would go and do such a thing ?
i' il ask the questions .
tell him .
tell him the liberator who destroyed my property has realigned my perception .
excuse me .
are you there ?
no , i am listening .
it' s a little hard to know what to make of all this .
have you recently made enemies with anyone who might have access to homemade dynamite ?
enemies ?
reject the basic assumption of civilization , especially the importance of material possessions .
son , this is serious .
yes , i know it' s serious .
i mean that .
yes , it' s very serious .
look , nobody takes this more seriously than me .
that condo was my life .
ok ?
i loved every stick of furniture in that place .
that was not just a bunch of stuff that got destroyed .
it was me !
i' d like to thank the academy .
is this not a good time for you ? just tell him you fuckin ' did it .
shhh !
tell him you blew it all up .
that' s what he wants to hear .
are you still there ?
wait .
are you saying that i' m a suspect ?
no , no .
i may need to talk to you a little further , so how about you just lettin ' me know if you' re gonna leave town ?
ok ?
ok .
except for their humping ,
tyler and marla were never in the same room .
my parents pulled this exact same act for years .
the condom is the glass slipper of our generation .
you slip one on when you meet a stranger .
you ... dance all night .
then you throw it away .
the condom , i mean .
not the stranger .
what ?
i got this dress at a thrift store for $1 . 00 .
it was worth every penny .
it' s a bridesmaid' s dress .
someone loved it ... intensely for one day ... then tossed it .
like a christmas tree ... so special ... then ... bam ... it' s on the side of the road ... tinsel still clinging to it ...
like a sex crime victim ... underwear inside out ... bound with electrical tape .
well , then it suits you .
you can borrow it sometime .
get rid of her .
why can' t you get rid of her ?
don' t mention me .
i' m 6 years old again , passing messages between parents .
i really think it' s time you got out of here .
don' t worry .
i' m leaving .
not that we don' t love your little visits .
you are such a nut case .
i can' t even begin to keep up .
gotta get off
thanks .
bye .
gotta get off this merry go round
gotta get on where
you kids .
wh ...
why do you still waste time with her ?
i' il say this about marla at least she' s tryin ' to hit bottom .
what , and i' m not ?
stickin ' feathers up your butt does not make you a chicken .
what are we doin ' tonight ?
tonight ?
yeah .
we make soap .
really .
to make soap , first we render fat .
the salt balance has to be just right , so the best fat for making soap comes from humans .
wait .
what is this place ?
a liposuction clinic .
aha !
pay dirt .
the richest , creamiest fat in the world .
fat of the land .
come on .
oh , god !
oh !
get another one .
unhh !
as the fat renders , the tallows float to the surface .
like in boy scouts .
i can imagine you as a boy scout .
keep stirrin ' .
once the tallow hardens , we skim off a layer of glycerin .
if you were to add nitric acid , you got nitroglycerin .
if you were then to add sodium nitrate and a dash of sawdust , you got dynamite .
yeah , with enough soap , we could blow up just about anything .
tyler was full of useful information .
now , ancient peoples found that clothes got cleaner when they washed them at a certain point in the river .
you know why ?
no .
human sacrifices were once made on the hills above this river .
bodies burned .
water seeped into the wood and ashes to create lye .
this is lye , the crucial ingredient .
once it mixed with the melted fat of bodies , a thick , white , soapy discharge crept into the river .
may i see your hand , please ?
what is this ?
this ... is chemical burn .
uh aah !
aah !
it' il hurt more than you' ve ever been burned , and you will have a scar .
if meditation worked for cancer , it could work for this .
stay with the pain .
don' t shove to center .
no , no !
oh , god !
look at your hand .
the first soap was made from the ashes of heroes ,
like the first monkey shot into space .
without pain , without sacrifice , we would have nothin ' .
i tried not to think of the the words " sear " or " flesh .
stop it !
this is your pain .
this is your burning hand .
it' s right here .
i' m going to my cave .
i' m going to my cave and find my power animal .
no !
don' t deal with it the way those dead people do !
come on !
i get the point !
ok !
please !
no .
what you' re feeling is premature enlightenment .
this is the greatest moment of your life , man , and you' re off somewhere
shut up .
our fathers were our models for god .
if our fathers bailed , what does that tell you about god ?
no , no .
listen to me .
you have to consider the possibility that god does not like you ,
he never wanted you .
in all probability , he hates you .
this is not the worst thing that can happen .
we don' t need him .
we don' t !
i agree !
fuck damnation , man .
fuck redemption .
we are god' s unwanted children ?
so be it !
listen !
you can run water over your hand to make it worse , or look at me or you can use vinegar to neutralize the burn .
please let me have some !
please !
first you have to give up .
first you have to know , not fear , know that someday you' re gonna die .
you don' t know how this feels !
it' s only after we' ve lost everything that we' re free to do anything .
ok .
congratulations .
you' re one step closer to hitting bottom .
tyler sold his soap to department stores at $20 a bar .
god knows what they charged .
this is the best soap .
why , thank you , suzie .
it was beautiful .
we were selling rich women their own fat asses back to them .
he was wearing his yellow tie .
i didn' t even wear a tie to work anymore .
the first rule of fight club is you don' t talk about fight club " ?
i' m half asleep again .
i must' ve left the original in the copy machine .
the second rule of fight club " is this yours ?
huh ?
pretend you' re me .
make a managerial decision .
you find this .
what would you do ?
well , i gotta tell ya ...
i' d be very , very careful who you talk to about that .
because the person who wrote that ... is dangerous .
and this buttoned down , oxford cloth psycho might just snap and then stalk from office to office with an armilade ar 10 carbine gas powered semi automatic weapon , pumping round after round into colleagues and coworkers .
this might be someone you' ve known for years ... someone very ... very ... close to you .
tyler' s words coming out of my mouth .
and i used to be such a nice guy .
maybe you shouldn' t bring me every little piece of trash you happen to pick up .
liability .
my tit' s gonna rot off .
will you excuse me ?
i need to take this .
what' re you talking about ?
i need you to check and see if there' s a lump in my breast .
go to a hospital .
i can' t afford to throw money away on a doctor .
i don' t know about this , marla .
please ?
she didn' t call tyler .
i' m neutral in her book .
that' s nice .
taking food to mrs ...
hannaburr , mrs. raines ?
who are they ... exactly ?
tragically , they' re dead .
i' m alive , and i' m in poverty .
you want any ?
no .
no .
i got one for you .
thanks for the thought .
what happened to your hand ?
uh ... nothin ' .

no .
well , make sure .
ok , i' m i' m pretty sure .
you feel nothing .
no .
nothing .
well , that' s a relief .
thank you .
uh , um ... no problem .
i wish i could return the favor .
there' s not a lot of breast cancer in the men in my family .
could check your prostate .
i think i' m ok .
well , thanks , anyway .
are we done ?
yeah , we' re done .
see you ... around .
cornelius ?
cornelius !
it' s me ...
bob !
hey ...

well , uh , yeah , actually .
i

supposedly ... he was born in a mental institution .
and he sleeps only one hour a night .
he' s a great man .

look around .
look around .
i see a lot of new faces .
ha ha !
ha ha !
shut up !
which means a lot of you have been breaking the first 2 rules of fight club .
man , i see in fight club the strongest and smartest men who' ve ever lived .
i see all this potential .
and i see squandering .
god damn it .
an entire generation pumping gas ... waiting tables ... slaves with white collars .
advertising has its taste in cars and clothes ... working jobs we hate so we can buy shit we don' t need .
we' re the middle children of history , man .
no purpose or place .
we have no great war ... no great depression .
our great war' s a spiritual war .
our great depression is our lives .
we' ve all been raised on television to believe that one day we' d all be millionaires and movie gods and rock stars .
but we won' t .
we' re slowly learning that fact .
and we' re very , very pissed off .
yeah !
yeah !
first rule of fight club is you do not talk about
who are you ?
who am i ?
yeah .
there' s a sign in the front that says " lou' s tavern .
i' m fuckin ' lou .
who the fuck are you ?
tyler durden .
who told you motherfuckers that you could use my place ?
we have a deal worked out with irvin .
irvin ?
irvin' s at home with a broken collarbone .
he don' t own this place .
i do .
how much money is he gettin ' for this ?
there is no money .
really .
ain' t that somethin ' ?
free to all .
it is , actually .
look , stupid fuck ...

this week ... each one of you ... has a homework assignment .
you' re gonna go out .
you' re gonna start a fight with a total stranger .
you' re gonna start a fight .
and you' re gonna lose .
excellent choice , sir .
hey !
watch out , jackass !
come on !
now , this is not as easy as it sounds .
i' m thinkin ' you really what ? !
son of a bitch !
most people ... normal people ... do just about anything to avoid a fight .
excuse me .
you sprayed me with your hose .
like that ?
that' s not necessary .
dave !
go call 911 !
aaaahhh !
stop it !
stop it !
sorry .
what did come here !
leave me alone !
you crazy ?
uhh !
unhh !
uhh !
bastard !
we need to talk .
ok .
where to begin ?
with your constant absenteeism ?
with your unpresentable appearance ?
you' re up for review .
i am jack' s ... complete lack of surprise .
what ?
let' s pretend .
you' re the department of transportation .
ok ?
someone informs you that this company installs front seat mounting brackets that never pass collision tests ... brake linings that fail after a thousand miles , and fuel injectors that explode and burn people alive .
what then ?
are you threatening me ?
no ...
get the fuck outta here .
you' re fired .
i have a better solution .
you keep me on the payroll as an outside consultant .
and in exchange for my salary , my job will be never to tell people these things that i know .
i don' t even have to come into the office .
i can do this job from home .
who who the fuck do you think you are , you crazy little shit ?
security ?
i am jack' s smirking revenge .
ohh !
ohh !
ahh ... ahh ...
what the hell are you doing ?
ohh ... that hurt .
why would you do that ?
oh , my god .
no !
please stop !
uhh !
uh ... uhh !
what are you doing ?
oh , god , no !
please !
no !
for some reason , i thought of my first fight with tyler .
no !
under and behind and inside , everything this man took for granted ... something horrible had been growing .
now , look .
give me the paychecks like i asked , and you won' t ever see me again .
and right then , at our most excellent moment together ...
oh ... thank god .
please don' t hit me again .
please ...
telephone , computer , fax machine , 52 weekly paychecks , and 48 airline flight coupons .
we now had corporate sponsorship .
this is how tyler and i were able to have fight club every night of the week .
now nobody was the center of fight club except the 2 men fighting .
the leader walked through the crowd , out in the darkness .
tyler was now involved in a class action lawsuit with the pressman hotel over the urine content of their soup .
i am jack' s wasted life .
yeah !
yeah !
ha ha !
yeah !
there you are , sir .
tyler dreamed up new homework assignments .
he handed them out in sealed envelopes .
did you know there' s a fight club up in delaware city ?
yeah , i heard .
there' s one in penn' s grove , too .
bob even found one up in newcastle .
yeah .
did you start that one ?
no .
i thought you did .
nah .
pff ! .
stop for a second .
hey , what are we doing ?
turn around .
what are we doing ?
homework assignment .
what kind of homework assignment ?
human sacrifice .
hey , is that a gun ?
please .
please tell me that' s not a gun .
it' s a gun .
what are you doing ?
meet me in the back .
hey , don' t fuck around .
meet me in the back .
on a long enough time line , the survival rate for everyone drops to zero .
what are you doing ?
come on .
hands behind your back .
god .
give me your wallet .
raymond k. hessel , 1320 southeast banning , apartment a.
small , cramped basement apartment , raymond ?
how did you know ?
because they give shitty basement apartments
letters instead of numbers .
raymond ... you' re going to die .
oh , my god , no ...
is that your mom and dad ?
mom and dad are going to have to call up kindly dr. so and so to pick up your dental records .
you want to know why ?
because there' s going to be nothing left of your face .
aw , come on .
an expired community college student i. d.
what' d you study , raymond ?
s s s stuff .
stuff ?
were the midterms hard ?
i asked you what you studied .
biology , mostly .
why ?
i i don' t know .
what did you want to be , raymond k. hessel ?
the question , raymond , was what did you want to be ?
answer him , raymond !
jesus !
veterinarian !
veterinarian !
animals .
yeah , animal s s s
stuff .
yeah , i got that .
that means you have to get more schooling .
too much school .
would you rather be dead ?
no ...
would you rather die , here , on your knees , in the back of a convenience store ?
no ...
no , please ... no ...
i' m keeping your license .
gonna check in on you .
i know where you live .
if you' re not on your way to becoming a veterinarian in 6 weeks , you will be dead .
now run on home .
run , forrest , run !
i feel ill .
imagine how he feels .
come on , this isn' t funny !
that wasn' t funny .
what the fuck was the point of that ?
tomorrow will be the most beautiful day of raymond k. hessel' s life .
his breakfast will taste better than any meal you and i have ever tasted .
you had to give it to him .
come on .
he had a plan .
and it started to make sense in a tyler sort of way .
no fear .
no distractions .
the ability to let that which does not matter truly slide .
you' re not your job .
you' re not how much money you have in the bank .
you' re not the car you drive .
you' re not the contents of your wallet .
you' re not your fuckin ' khakis .
you' re the all singing , all dancing crap of the world .
i' il be out of your way in a sec .
you don' t have to go .
whatever .
no , i mean , uh ...
it' s ok .
are you still going to groups ?
yeah .
chloe' s dead .
ah , chloe .
when did that happen ?
do you care ?
i don' t know .
i haven' t thought about it in a while .
yeah , well ...
i think it was a smart move on her part .
hey , listen , uh ... what are you getting out of all this ?
what ?
i mean , all this .
why do you keep ...
is this making you happy ?
yeah , well , sometimes .
i don' t know .
i don' t understand .
why does a weaker person need to latch on to a strong person ?
what is that ?
well , what do you get out of it ?
no it' s it' s not the same thing at all .
i mean , we' re ...
it' s totally different with us .
we' re we' re
us ?
what do you mean by " us " ?
i' m sorry , do you hear this ?
hear what ?
you' re not hearing all that noise ? just hold on a second .
no , wait .
what were you saying ?
don' t change the subject .
i want to talk about this .
you' re not talking about me , are you ?
no .
what ?
that day you came over to my place to play doctor what was going on there ?
what are you talking about ?
nothing .
nothing .
i don' t think so .
come on , what do you want ?
look at me .
no .
what ?
look at me .
what is that ?
it' s nothing .
don' t worry about it .
oh , my god .

you are not special .
you are not a beautiful or unique snowflake .
you are the same decaying organic matter as everything else .
tyler built himself an army .
we are the all singing , all dancing crap of the world .
we are all part of the same compost heap .
why was tyler durden building an army ?
to what purpose ?
for what greater good ?
in tyler we trusted .
no , when he was like , " you are not your job , " i was like ...
yeah !
hey , what' s all this ?
ok !
go on in and celebrate .
what are we celebrating ?
go on .
hey .
let me get that for you .
investigators are on the scene right now .
hold on .
police commissioner jacobs has just arrived .
commissioner , commissioner , could you please tell us what you think has happened here ?
we believe this is one of many recent acts of vandalism around the city somehow related to underground boxing clubs .
we' il be coordinating a rigorous investigation .
that was police commissioner jacobs , who just arrived on the scene here of a 4 alarm fire that broke out about an hour ago .
she' s hot .
live from the parker morris building ,
lauren sanchez .

yeah !
ha ha ha ha !
yeah .
holy shit .
yeah !
yeah !
ha ha ha !
hoo hoo hoo !
what the fuck did you guys do ?
news anchor : ... how the blaze started , but arson investigators are on the premises ...
sir , the first rule of project mayhem is you do not ask questions , sir .
the victory in the war against crime will not come overnight .
it will take dedication and commitment , and most of all , cooperation .
the streets are safer now .
there is hope in the inner city .
however , this is only the beginning .
i gotta take a piss .
these are the first steps in a long journey .
that is why we have created project hope ...
bob .
helping others with prevention and enforcement .
project hope will be a joint effort between the police and community leaders .
it will be a powerful new weapon in the war against crime .
haahhhh !
wrap it around the top of his hacky sack , bob .
yeah .
his balls are ice cold .
hi .
you' re gonna call off your rigorous investigation .
you' re gonna publicly state that there is no underground group , or ... these guys are gonna take your balls .
they' re gonna send one to the new york times , one to the l. a. times press release style .
look ... the people you are after are the people you depend on .
we cook your meals .
we haul your trash .
we connect your calls .
we drive your ambulances .
we guard you while you sleep .
do not fuck with us .
fooled ya .
bob , you' re on this one .
let' s go .
i am jack' s inflamed sense of rejection .
hey !
yeah !
i felt like putting a bullet between the eyes of every panda that wouldn' t screw to save its species .
i wanted to open the dump valves on oil tankers and smother all those french beaches
i' d never see .
i wanted to breathe smoke .
where' d you go , psycho boy ?
i felt like destroying something beautiful .
get him to a fuckin ' hospital .
yeah .
don' t worry , mr. durden .
airport parking , long term .
after you , mr. durden .
after you .
something on your mind , dear ?
no .
all right , yeah .
why wasn' t i told about project mayhem ?
first rule of project mayhem is you do not ask questions .
what are you talking about ?
why didn' t you include me in the beginning ?
fight club was the beginning .
now it' s moved out of the basement , it' s called project mayhem .
you and i started fight club together .
do you remember that ?
it' s as much mine as it is yours , you know .
is this about you and me ?
yeah .
i thought we were doing this together .
you' re missing the point .
this does not belong to us .
we are not special .
fuck that .
you should' ve told me .
hey , tyler !
goddamn it , tyler !
what do you want ? !
statement of purpose ?
should i e mail you ?
should i put this on your action item list ?
you decide your own level of involvement !
i will !
i want to know certain things first .
the first rule of project mayhem
shut up !
i want to know what you' re thinking .
fuck what you know .
you need to forget about what you know .
that' s your problem .
forget about what you think you know about life , about friendship , and especially about you and me .
what ?
what is that supposed to mean ?
what ...
what are you doing ?
guys , what do you wish you' d done before you die ?
paint a self portrait .
build a house .
and you ?
i don' t know .
get in the right lane .
i have to know the answer to this question .
if you were to die right now , how would you feel about your life ?
i don' t know !
i wouldn' t feel anything good about my life .
is that what you want to hear me say ?
fine .
come on !
not good enough .

tyler !
jesus christ !

why ?
what are you talking about ?
why do you think i blew up your condo ?

hitting bottom isn' t a weekend retreat .
it' s not a goddamn seminar .
stop trying to control everything and just let go .
let go !
all right .
fine .
fine .
i' d never been in a car accident .
this must have been what all those people felt like before i filed them as statistics in my reports .
goddamn .
huh ?
ha ha ha ha ha hahh !
we just had a near life experience .
in the world i see , you' re stalking elk through the damp canyon forest , around the ruins of rockefeller center .
you' il wear leather clothes that will last you the rest of your life .
you' il climb the vines that wrap the sears tower .
and when you look down , you' il see tiny figures pounding corn ,
laying strips of venison on the empty carpool lane of some abandoned superhighway .
feel better , champ .
and then ...
tyler ?
tyler was gone .
was i asleep ?
had i slept ?
you are not a beautiful unique snowflake , do you understand me ?
the house had become a living thing , wet inside from so many people sweating and breathing .
we are all from the same compost .
so many people moving , the house moved .
planet tyler .
i had to hug the walls .
trapped inside this clockwork of space monkeys .
you can' t be smoking in here .
do you know how much ether we have in this fucking house ?
cooking , working , and sleeping in teams .
hang on a second .
it' s under control , sir .
where is tyler ?
sir , the first rule of project mayhem is you do not

ok .
i' m all alone .
my father dumped me .
tyler dumped me .
i am jack' s broken heart .
what comes next in project mayhem , only tyler knows .
the second rule is you do not ask questions .

i went to all the cities on tyler' s used ticket stubs , barhopping .
i didn' t know how or why , but i could look at 50 different bars and somehow i just knew .
i' m looking for tyler durden .
it' s very important that i talk to him .
i wish i could help you .
sir .
every city i went to ... as soon as i set foot off the plane ,
i knew a fight club was close .
hey !
hey !
taxi !
look at my face .
i' m a member .
now , i just need to know if you' ve seen tyler .
i' m not exposed to ... speak any such information to you , nor would i , even if i had said information you want at this juncture , be able .
you' re a moron .
i' m afraid i' m gonna have to ask you to leave .
tyler had been busy .
setting up franchises all over the country .
was i asleep ?
had i slept ?
is tyler my bad dream , or am i tyler' s ?
we' ve just heard the stories .
what kind of stories ?
like , nobody knows what he looks like .
he has facial reconstructive surgery every 3 years .
that' s the stupidest thing i' ve ever heard .
is it true about fight club in miami ?
is mr. durden building an army ?
i was living in a state of perpetual dj vu .
everywhere i went ,
i felt i' d already been there .
it was like following an invisible man .
the smell of dried blood , dirty , bare footprints circling each other , that aroma of old sweat , like fried chicken .
the feel of a floor still warm from the fight the night before .
i was always just one step behind tyler .
his name is robert paulson .
his name is robert paulson .
his
welcome back , sir .
how have you been ?
do you know me ?
is this a test , sir ?
no , this is not a test .
you were in here last thursday .
thursday ?
you were standing exactly where you are now , asking how good security is .
it' s tight as a drum , sir .
who do you think i am ?
are you sure this isn' t a test ?
no , this is not a test .
you' re mr. durden .
you' re the one who gave me this .
please return your seat backs to their full , upright and locked position .
yeah ?
marla , it' s me .
have we ever done it ?
done what ?
have we ever had sex ?
what kind of stupid question is that ?
is it stupid because the answer' s yes , or because the answer' s no ?
is this a trick ?
no , marla , i need to know
you mean you want to know if i think we were just having sex or making love ?
we did make love .
is that what you' re calling it ? just answer the question ,
marla , please !
did we do it or not ?
you fuck me , then snub me .
you love me , you hate me .
you show me a sensitive side , then you turn into a total asshole .
is that a pretty accurate description of our relationship , tyler ?
we have just lost cabin pressure .
what did you just say ?
what is wrong with you ?
what did you call me ?
say my name !
tyler durden .
tyler durden , you fucking freak .
what' s going on ?
i' m coming over .
no , wait , marla , i' m not there
you broke your promise .
jesus , tyler .
you fuckin ' talked to her about me .
tyler , what the fuck is going on here ?
i asked you for one thing , one simple thing .
why do people think that i' m you ?
answer me !
sit .
now answer me .
why do people think that i' m you ?
i think you know .
no , i don' t .
yes , you do .
why would anyone possibly confuse you with me ?
uh ...
i ...
i don' t know .
you got it .
no .
do not fuck with us .
say it .
because ...
say it .
because we' re the same person .
that' s right .
we are the all singing , all dancing
i don' t understand this .
you were looking for a way to change your life .
you could not do this on your own .
all the ways you wish you could be , that' s me .
i look like you wanna look ,
i fuck like you wanna fuck ,
i am smart , capable , and most importantly , i am free in all the ways that you are not .
oh , no .
tyler' s not here .
tyler went away .
tyler' s gone .
what ?
this is impossible .
no .
this is crazy .
people do it every day .
they talk to themselves .
they see themselves as they' d like to be .
they don' t have the courage you have , to just run with it .
naturally , you' re still wrestling with it , so sometimes you' re still you .
we should do this again sometime .
other times , you imagine yourself watching me .
if this is your first night at fight club , you have to fight .
little by little , you' re just letting yourself become ...
tyler durden .
you are not your job , or how much money you have in the bank !
no , you have a house .
rented in your name .
you have jobs , you have a whole life .
you have night jobs because you can' t sleep .
or you stay up and make soap .
marla you' re fucking marla , tyler .
uh , technically , you' re fucking marla .
but it' s all the same to her .
oh , my god .
now you see our dilemma .
she knows too much .
i think we' re going to have to talk about how this might compromise our goals .
wh what are you saying ?
this is this is bullshit .
this is bullshit .
i' m not listening to this .
you are insane .
no , you' re insane .
and we simply do not have time for this crap .
it' s called a changeover .
the movie goes on , and nobody in the audience has any idea .
sir !
are you checking out ?
yeah , uh , b bill me .
i need you to initial this list of phone calls , please .
when were these made ?

marla !
marla !
hey fuck !
wait !

marla , marla !
your whacked out bald freaks hit me with a fucking broom !
they almost broke my arm !
they were burning their fingertips with lye , the stink was unbelievable .
look look , listen , it' s gonna take a tremendous act of faith on your part , but you' ve got to hear me out .
oh , here comes an avalanche of bullshit .
a little more faith than that .
no , listen , i don' t want to hear anything you have to say .
you have every right to be ...
um , i' il just have a coffee , thanks .
sir , anything you order is free of charge , sir .
why is it free of charge ?
don' t don' t ask .
whatever .
i' il have the clam chowder , the fried chicken with the baked potato with everything , and a chocolate chiffon pie .
clean food , please .
in that case , sir , may i advise against the lady eating the clam chowder ?
no clam chowder , thank you .
you' ve got about 30 seconds .
marla , i know that i' ve been acting very , very strange .
ok , i know that it' s got to seem
like there' s 2 sides to me 2 sides ?
you' re dr. jekyil and mr. jackass .
i deserve that , but
i' ve come to realize something very , very important .
what ?
the full extent of our relationship wasn' t really clear to me up until now , for reasons i' m not going to go into , but the important thing is , i know that i haven' t been treating you so nice .
yeah , whatever .
no , no 15 seconds .
15 seconds , please , please .
15 seconds , don' t open your mouth .
i' m trying to tell you that i' m sorry .
because what i' ve come to realize is that i really like you , marla .
you do ?
i really do .
i care about you and i don' t want anything bad to happen to you because of me .
marla , your life is in danger .
what ?
you need to leave town for a while .
get out of any major city and just go camping or something .
you' re an insane person .
no , no , i' ve involved you in something terrible that' s about to happen .
no .
shut up , shut up !
listen , i tried , tyler .
i really tried .
i know you did .
there are things about you i like .
you' re smart , you' re funny , you' re spectacular in bed .
but you' re intolerable .
you have very serious emotional problems .
deep seated problems for which you should seek professional help .
i know , and i' m sorry .
yeah , you' re sorry , i' m sorry , everyone' s sorry .
but ...
i can' t do this anymore .
i can' t .
and i won' t .
i' m gone .
you can' t leave , marla , you' re not safe !
no !
leave me alone !
marla , i' m trying to protect you .
i don' t ever want to see you again !
that' s fine , if that' s what it takes ...
you wait .
wait right here .
hold it right there .
shut up !
shut up !
take this money and get on this bus .
and i promise you
i will never bother you again if that' s what you want .
shut up !
please get on the bus .
please get on the bus !
why are you doing this ?
because they think you' re some kind of a threat .
i i can' t explain it right now , just trust me .
if i see where you' re going , you will not be safe .
i' m not paying this back .
i consider it asshole tax .
that' s fine .
remember , stay out of major cities for at least a couple of days , ok ?
tyler .
you' re the worst thing that ever happened to me .
hello .
i need you to arrest me .
i am the leader of a terrorist organization responsible for numerous acts of vandalism , and assault all over this city .
... in the metropolitan area , with probably a couple hundred members .
chapters have sprung up in 5 or 6 other major cities already .
this is a tightly regimented organization , with many cells capable of operating completely independent of central leadership .
look , look , go to that house , ok ?
1537 paper street .
that' s our headquarters .
in the back , buried in the garden , you' il find the body of robert paulson .
in the basement , you' re gonna find some bathtubs that have been used very recently to make large quantities of nitroglycerin .
i believe the plan is to blow up the headquarters of these credit card companies , and the t. r. w. building .
why these buildings ?
why credit card companies ?
if you erase the debt record , then we all go back to zero .
it' il create total chaos .
keep him talking .
i need to make a phone call .
i really admire what you' re doing .
what ?
you' re a brave man to order this .
you' re a genius , sir .
you said , if anyone ever interferes with project mayhem even you we gotta get his balls .
it' s useless to fight .
this is really a powerful gesture ,
mr. durden .
it' il set quite an example .
you' re making a big mistake , fellas .
you said you' d say that .
i' m not tyler durden !
you told us you' d say that , too .
all right , i am tyler durden .
listen to me ,
i' m giving you a direct order .
we are aborting this mission , right now .
you said you would definitely say that .

tyler , get away from the van .
tyler , i' m not kidding !

would you like to say a few words to mark the occasion ?
i' m sorry ?
i still can' t think of anything .
ah , flashback humor .
it' s getting exciting now .
2 and 1/ 2 .

one step closer to economic equilibrium .

you' re a fucking hallucination , why can' t i get rid of you ?
you need me .
no , i don' t , i really don' t anymore .
hey , you created me .
i didn' t create some loser alter ego to make myself feel better .
take some responsibility .
i do .
i am responsible for all of it , and i accept that .
so please , i' m begging you , please call this off .
have i ever let us down ?
how far have you come because of me ?
i will bring us through this .
as always ,
i will carry you , kicking and screaming , and in the end , you will thank me .
tyler .
tyler , i' m grateful to you for everything that you' ve done for me .
but this is too much .
i don' t want this .
what do you want ? !
want to go back to the shit job , fucking condo world , watching sitcoms ?
