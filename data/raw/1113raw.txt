nile ,
nile , nile , impetuous and turbulent river you' re like our queen , the source of life .
asterlx and cleopatra
our story begins in a distant past , in alexandria , or at alexandria , both are possible ... ... in egypt , at the palace of the queen of queens .
the legendary and elegant cleopatra .
enough !
i' m saying egypt' s culture isn' t all that great ...
there were good times of course .
i' m just saying the current people are decadent .
and that egypt is merely a roman province .
a " province " !
yes ...
until further notice , o caesar ... ... it' s not the romans that build the great pyramids .
those pointy things ?
and the sphinx ?
and the tower of pharos ?
what do you think of that ?
that' s old news .
yesterday ... ... or today , my people are superior .
in fact your people are ... ... greek , and i know better true egyptians .
enough !
i can prove to you , o caesar ... ... that my people are still brilliant .
yes ?
how ?
painting portraits ?
no , by building a palace .
i already have a palace in rome .
you' il get one in alexandria too .
so when you visit the " province " ... ... you' il have somewhere to sleep .
but it will be bigger ... ... and more luxurious than all other palaces .
bigger than " caesar' s palace " ?
i' d like to see that ...
you will see .
rome wasn' t built in one day .
when will it be finished ?
three centuries from now ?
three months .
three months ?
three months ?
three ...
... months ?
within 3 months you' il have your palace .
it' il never be finished in time .
but fine , i accept the challenge .
if you make it , i' il publicly admit ... ... that your people is still brilliant .
but i have my doubts .
see you in three months ...
he really gets the most of me .
oh no ... why is the floor already finished ?
first the water pipes .
now we have to break up the floor .
malococsis , i' m not an architect .
i' m a tiler .
what' s that door doing there ?
no idea .
ask edifis , the architect .
architects ...
along with cart wrights they' re the most incompentent .
malococsis !
edifis ...
i' m happy to see you .
how are you ?
terrible !
w ... w ... what' s the problem ?
the door in the ceiling ?
that ?
i anticipate .
should you want a second floor , no problem .
and the tiles .
beautiful , huh ?
feudartifis , come see .
are they beautiful or what ?
beautiful .
malococsis ... trust me ... ... i' m not a cart wright .
you' re worse .
you' re running two months behind .
watch it , i have connections .
people in high places who could cause you a great deal of problems .
preferably from alexandria ...
architect edifis ?
no , that' s ... what' s it about ?
i had to laugh because of the alexandria joke ... ... because people in high places makes me think about monkeys in a tree ...
you don' t have to get angry .
my little one ... wake up .
breakfast .
kinepolis ...
what' s that ?
lovendpis ...
serge ...
artifis ... clean the water .
it stinks .
i don' t smell anything ...
i was just doing what i always do .
that' s your problem .
you always do like you always do .
yes , i always do .
the floor is weird .
i don' t feel it .
where is it ?
good day .
edifis , is egypt the most powerful empire in the world ?
yes .
no one in the world has more power .
of course i don' t know everyone .
the romans and caesar have their doubts .
i' m going to show him what we can do .
ok .
i' m building him the most magnificent palace .
ok .
and you , edifis , will be the architect .
ok .
i' il be the architect .
meaning ?
i' il have to ...
al my other architects are busy .
no , i' m not busy .
he' s not busy .
edifis , you' re the only one available .
i have no time .
i have to finish my work for malococsis .
only the tiles , but anyway ...
my queen , as your architect i offer you my services .
when the crocodiles have fresh water , i could ...
no , you' re good , but too conservative .
conservative ...
what does that mean ?
i want something new , something refreshing .
but ... help edifis .
find some land .
land ?
as you wish .
go , edifis , you' ve got three months .
three months ?
what margin ?
because three months , that' s merely enough for the plans ... ... and with the foundations , that' s three times four , nine ...
three months , that' s ...
i don' t think that' s enough .
edifis !
you' ve got three months .
exactly !
if you succeed , i' il cover you with gold .
if you fail , i' il feed you to the crocodiles .
where' s the sweet little lamb ?
they ate the little lamb ?
i should build that palace .
then i , neither cleopatra , the rain ... ... the hail nor the locusts ... ... would be egypt' s worst nightmare .
17 , 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 ...
474 , 475 , 476 , 477 ...
boss !
boss !
i rushed myself ...
i was thinking about some sort of machine ... ... that would enable us to reach the top of the pyramid .
otis ... can' t this wait ?
what are you counting , boss ?
i' m measuring .
cleopatra wants a palace for caesar .
here .
on this stroke of land .
from there ... to there .
that would be a big palace .
it has to be modern and daring .
that' s great .
you can stop now ... ... leave it to the experts .
no time , we' ve got 3 months .
fine .
and how much extra time ?
none .
we' ve got 3 months , not a day more .
impossible .
that' s obvious .
however urgent jobs can be interesting .
it' s not urgent , it' s suicide .
if i fail , i' il be fed to the crocodiles .
and i saw them ...
a crocodile is fast .
not good .
i can' t finish my machine .
did you hear me did you hear me ?
yes , no , but ...
sorry , but i can be eaten .
three months starting when ?
the clock is ticking .
they' ve been working on the gardens for years .
and there' s nothing .
completely nothing .
we need magic .
we need to be magicians .
gods .
exactly ...
we need magical powers .
yes , it' s not good news , but that' s it .
when i was little ... ... my dad told me about this druid .
geta getabemix .
getasonixme ...
something ending in ix ?
helmutlottix ?
it starts with geta ... and ends in ininekix .
how about pommederainettepommedapix .
a druid .
a gallic druid with a magic potion .
it gives people enormous strength .
using that potion i' il finish in no time and stay alive .
imhotep , i didn' t expect it , but suddenly i' m freed .
boss ... ... magic potions don' t exist .
only on children' s papyrus drawings .
get us some workers .
let them start the foundations .
there will be a lane with big statues .
called " big statue lane " .
and there gardens with olive and orange trees , willows , ....
yes , and there the palace , luxurious and magnificent .
with a huge court yard and lots of dancers .
and there a small geranium , yes , that will be beautiful .
that will be really beautiful .
you have to picture it .
yes .
i' m leaving .
see you in a month .
a month ?
max .
the time to find getabemix and come back .
go , cannabis .
go , cannabis !
let' s go !
you' re not moving , cannabis .
move it !
go , cannabis !
where does that mix live ?
up north .
he lives up north .
go , go cannabis .
the year is 50 b. c.
gaul is entirely occupied by the romans .
well , not entirely ...
one small village of invincible gauls still holds out against the invaders .
and life is not easy for the roman legionaries who garrison the fortified camps of
totorum , aquarium , laudanum and compendium ...
en garde , gaul .
defend yourself !
one moment please .
what was that ?
are you new here ?
yes , we' ve just been transferred .
i understand .
this potion is a magic potion ... ... made by our druid and it makes us stronger .
look .
getamanix !
getamenixme !
what kind of country is this ?
incredible , it' s minus 8000 degrees here .
i don' t have to drink it , i fell in when i was a little boy .
it gives me extraordinary power .
look .
nice , huh ?
good day .
where' s the gallic village .
if you follow them you' il get there
i' m not going with you , ok ?
i' m staying here .
i' m going to think a little .
those romans are good , they fly better than the others .
it' s because of their new helmets .
they' re more aerodynamic .
listen ...
landing could be better .
excuse me ?
are you asterixme ?
rix .
asterix .
and this is obelix .
and the dog is dogmatix .
do you know getabamenix ?
a druid .
getafix , excuse me for disturbing , but you have a visitor .
sir ?
it' s me !
he obviously doesn' t know you .
i , i , i' m edifis .
i' m tumeris ' son , your old friend .
what a pleasant surprise .
you must be frozen .
i' m very happy to see you .
he' s from alexandria .
come warm yourself .
that' s the magic potion ?
no , chestnut soup .
no .
i can' t sell you any potion .
not all of it .
one cauldron .
no .
he won' t budge , it' s the principle .
a small cauldron .
no .
a flask .
no .
a small flask .
nee .
a cup .
a small cup .
a small cup , that' s all .
it' s a secret among druids and not for sale .
a little cup is not much .
i' m sorry , edifis .
ok then .
you were my only hope .
the small chance of survival .
but i understand .
you have other things to worry about .
caesar , the romans .
who i' m not fond of .
maybe i' m going to die ...
but it was nice knowing you .
gentlemen ...
midifix ...
but what' s wrong ?
edifis , wait .
i' ve been planning to consult some manuscripts ... ... in alexandria' s library .
i can' t promise anything ... ... but i' il join you .
thanks .
thanks a lot , getamanix .
my ship is waiting , there' s enough room for everyone .
there' s no time to loose .
let' s go , dogmatix .
you' re not going to take him are you ?
why not ?
he' s too small for such a big trip .
and egypt is the land of cats .
pack your bags and don' t talk about any longer .
don' t talk about it ...
accompanied by the arctic wind , on board of the napadelis ... ... a long journey to egypt begins , the land of ra , the sun god .
cleopatra' s kingdom would soon welcome ... ... asterix , obelix and getafix
and dogmatix ?
what ?
i bark .
i' m not allowed to talk anymore , so i bark .
fine .
take him out , before he suffocates .
but it' s empty .
" it' s empty " .
such a smart dog .
my baby .
how nice .
he wanted to be with me .
he got in there himself .
we were just saying ... ... three months is a little short .
artifis is a real hyena .
do you know hyenas ?
just the same .
he wants me dead and he has many talents .
like what ?
no , he' s rich .
he' s got many golden talents .
the egyptian coin .
in gaul not the ones with most talents are the richest .
do we have to fear anything else ?
no , nothing .
red beard !
red beard !
men , last time we weren' t very lucky meeting those gauls ... ... with their magic potion , and that big dog .
completely outnumbered we had no other option than to ...
run away .
no , not really .
we had to abandon ship as soon as possible .
swimming in that ice cold water .
no , it was nice .
it was ice cold .
fine .
to prevent further trouble , we' il avoid the gauls .
but for any others , no pity !
ship at starboard !
ready to board , daddy .
raise the oars .
calm down , my girl .
besides you' re not making any sense .
that' s what i thought .
how many ships , boy ?
just one , captain , a small one .
egyptian , captain .
egyptian .
egyptian .
sounds good .
this will get us back on track .
" ipso facto et manu militari " .
triplepod .
man your posts .
bosco , gambler , mullet , hoist the sails !
rackham , worley , husk , blow the horns .
get ready to board .
i' m king of the world !
pirates !
help , pirates !
look , pirates .
quick , we have to have to get out of here .
the pirates .
it' s us !
the g ...
the ga ...
the gau ...
the gauls !
this can' t be happening .
is there an axe here ?
watch out .
pardon me .
calm down there .
what are they doing ?
cheater !
it' s not fair .
good .
sink it yourselves .
they know who we are .
they' re old friends .
we' ve met them many times at sea before .
you see , " abyssus abyssum invocat .
enough of those latin proverbs .
what' s that at the horizon ?
the lights of alexandria .
let the butterflies of my youth strand .
i don' t know why i just said that .
i' m hungry .
we' il be there in the morning .
that' s the tower of pharos , a beacon for ships .
a beacon for ships .
egyptians are mad .
it' s one of the seven wonders of the world .
the biggest construction ever made by man .
i' m hungrier than a barracuda .
bar ra cu da .
you wanted to see me , edifis .
my queen , the palace is getting along nicely but there is not enough time .
that' s why i asked some gallic friends , a druid and 2 warriors ... ... to help me with my task .
i' m here to ask your approval ... ... for their help .
if it' s ok with you .
i wasn' t sure .
you can ask anyone for help .
finish the palace in time .
that' s all i ask .
caesar mocks me every day .
i can' t afford to loose this bet .
he' s completely full of himself .
completely .
completely .
listen ... ... make sure you finish in time and everyone shall receive gold .
i would like that .
else ... the crocodiles .
i wouldn' t like that .
now go .
he' s cute with that moustache .
a little old .
no , the other one .
no , too fat .
you do it on purpose ?
she' s probably got an evil personality , but a lovely nose .
she' il feed me to the crocodiles .
very lovely .
lovely nose , and with a little braid on the side .
i' m going to be crocodile food and he' s dreaming about her nose .
do crocodiles taste nice ?
could you show a little more interest in me ?
a big ant .
what a crowd !
looks like the biannual cattle market of lutetia .
all new breeds of cows are presented there .
a great show .
which kind of cows do you have ?
yes , continue .
there' s nothing going on .
yes , still a lot of work to be done .
and only 2 months left .
about that magic potion , when i visited you in gaul ... ... you told me you would take care of things .
now i would like to know ...
i said i would see if i could help .
how do you mean ?
where did all that sand come from ?
that was already here .
all those stones were delivered by the nile express .
hitting those slaves is very violent .
they' re not slaves .
they' re construction workers ... ... they do this voluntarily and they get paid .
and those whiplashes are for fun ?
no .
yes ...
i don' t know .
we haven' t had any complaints so far .
istou " ?
maybe it means " continue " .
the signal that the soup has arrived .
no .
they' re relieved .
tradition calls for them to exchange hair .
now they' re bonded by hair .
it' s a different culture .
do you remember that menhir i threw at caius bonus ?
i bet it weighed just as much as that bunch of stones .
you should ask him .
he' s best positioned to answer .
it' s a different culture .
another bill .
i hate paperwork .
otis , my writer .
writer , that' s a comfortable position ...
i don' t think there are any good or bad positions .
if i have to summarize my life , i' il start with my encounters .
the people that stood up for me , when i was all alone .
it' s strange that coincidence determines your faith ... ... because once you' ve had a taste of the good life ... ... it' s sometimes hard to find someone to speak to .
the mirror that helps you forward .
but not in my case , cause i succeeded .
i thank life ... ... i sing , i dance .
i' m love ... ... and when people ask me why i' m so humane ... ... i tell them it' s the taste of love .
which today leads me to this kind of mechanical construction .
but tomorrow might lead me to be of service to the whole community ... ... and i' il give myself .
what' s for dinner this afternoon ?
lentils .
i' il be back .
this is the place where soon caesar' s palace will be .
to be finished in 58 days .
what are you looking for ?
i' ve lost my lentil .
workers
workers .
friends .
have we gone back to the days of the pharaoh' s ?
slaving away and getting whipped ?
and for whom ?
for caesar ...
let him build his palace in rome .
everyone at his place and the hippos will be fine .
that' s true ...
friends , you are being exploited .
you' re being exhausted and ... ... to be honest ...
there .
he' s right .
and there two huge statues .
but not too huge .
15 meters high is enough .
and at the edge of the sphinxes , a big kitchen .
next to the bedrooms , that' s maybe not ideal .
because of the noise and odour ?
could become annoying .
didn' t think about that .
why are those grapes so big ?
they' re dates , obelix .
they grow on those trees .
crunchy on the inside .
that' s the stone .
not bad .
lunch break is over .
get to work !
i hardly said anything .
only that lunch break was over .
we' re not satisfied !
we' re not satisfied !
please ?
yes ...
we' re not satisfied !
we' re not satisfied !
we refuse to work any longer under these conditions .
it' s unbearable .
we' re not satisfied !
calm down , calm down .
we' re not satisfied !
who' s in charge ?
ok fine .
i' il speak for all of us .
i' m itineris .
i' m listening .
you have two new messages .
first of all : we' re working more than 18 hours a day or 36 hours in 2 days .
we want it lowered to 35 hours .
that' il never work .
it' il cause problems .
secondly , and sorry for interrupting you ... ... we want a decrease of at least 50 % .
an increase you mean .
no .
a decrease of the number of whiplashes .
we get too many whiplashes .
some people get headaches from the noise .
their head is ready to burst .
yes ... ... and concerning the food ...
some wild boar alongside the lentils would be nice .
the less whiplashes , the slower you work .
then the palace doesn' t get finished in time , and i' il be fed to the crocodiles .
enough , edifis .
itineris is right ... ... to not allow that .
i' m sure they would be happy with some wild boar .
it' s ready .
no , you fell in when you were little .
come on , dogmatix .
give them a demonstration , asterix .
be careful , it might be a bit too strong .
it' s a little too strong .
no , it' s very good .
dogmatix , do a trick .
do a trick .
sit !
it' s a miracle ...
is there enough for everyone ?
i' il make some more .
no , obelix , you ...
fell in when i was little ....
yes , alright .
no !
obelix , no .
hohis .
that' s his name .
nobis ?
no , hohis .
with an h .
nexusis .
can i help you ?
an imhotep .
two .
i have a job for you .
no problem .
who do you want me to kill ?
no , we' re not killing anyone .
here you go , two imhoteps .
the construction of the palace has to stop .
they' re waiting for stones from the south .
make sure they don' t arrive .
no stones , no construction .
no construction , no palace .
no palace ... ... no palace .
here' s some gold to cover your expenses .
you give back whatever' s left .
nice tunic .
i came , i saw , i conquered .
veni , vidi , vici .
the usual stuff .
cesare " .
cesare " or " caesar " ?
caesar .
it sounded cool , but ...
engrave 4 plates .
ave caesar .
power and prosperity ...
power and prosperity , caius c+ .
good news ?
i came , i saw , i conquered .
as usual
veni , vidi , ok .
vici is a little premature .
what do you mean ?
gaul for example ...
what about gaul ?
gaul is vici .
it' s completely occupied .
no it isn' t .
one small village of invincible gauls still holds out ... ... against the invaders , yes i know .
i' ve heard it over and over .
and cleopatra , they stopped construction ?
no , it' s going fine .
it' s beautiful .
they even ... on the inside ...
no .
excuse me .
don' t touch me ...
they' il finish in time .
impossible .
the gauls don' t know the meaning of the word .
edifis got 3 of them to help him .
one of them is the druid teachix .
getafix ?
yes , i knew it sounded like that .
aikix and journalduhix .
or malcomix .
keep an eye on them for now .
i' il decide later what to do .
si vis pacem , para bellum .
if you want peace , prepare for war .
brucewillix .
in the mean time , the ruthless nexusis ... ... sent by artifis , was completing his mission .
cut off the supply of stones ... ... by bribing the foul convoy supervisor .
there the buildings can form a " c " , from cleopatra .
it' s caesar' s palace .
that' s possible too .
what do you mean ?
the stones have arrived .
the supervisor says there are no more stones in the quarries .
funny language .
he wants to be paid .
he' s lying .
no , he really wants to be paid .
no , about the quarries .
there have to be more stones .
i could make him talk .
can i ?
ok .
but don' t overdo it , he needs to be able to talk .
how do you say " talk " ?
in the sense of " i don' t speak egyptian very well " ... ... it' s " medou ene ere comete " .
if it' s " talk a little slower " , then it' s " medou ere keteb " .
medou ere keteb " .
no , " ketebece " .
ketebece " .
" keteb " .
ketebece " , when they' re 8 of them .
ketebece " .
no , not " ketebece " .
no , sorry .
no one understands you .
keteb " open , " keteb " generious .
say ...
ouchebe " .
ouchebe " .
no ?
not " ouchebe " ?
no , obelix , not so furious .
he says artifis paid him to throw the stones into the nile .
there are enough stones in the quarry .
ai ...
ai ...
he says ...
yes , ai , i understand that part .
he says " ai " because he' s in pain .
i' m in pain .
not the moustache .
not the moustache .
he' s finished .
we' il go with him .
i' il stay here to keep an eye on things .
otis will accompany you to ...
yes , to ...
here .
amulets .
lucky charms to protect you .
thanks .
amsterisque .
rix .
risque .
yes , rix ...
risque .
the faith of egypt is in your hands .
isn' t that a little exaggerated ?
my faith is in your hands .
that' s better .
go , amsterisque !
rix .
risque .
so our gallic friends and otis went on their way ... ... to the quarries to get the stones .
what' s wrong with your dromedary ?
it' s my stomach .
while i pack up the boat , you can visit the sphinx .
there will be many restaurants .
you can stuff yourself with all kinds of things ... ... steamed fish , meat in sauce .
i knew it , nothing to eat .
nice , those little sphinxes .
i could make little menhirs .
sphinx !
never mind .
sphinx !
no , thanks .
stranger , a portrait with the sphinx as souvenir ?
a statue in 30 minutes ?
yes why not ?
it would look nice at my place .
do you accept sestertius ?
sure .
stand in profile please ... ... shoulders up front .
not to far .
we have to be more alert .
artifis is a snake .
besides the transport he could attack the construction site .
we must organise a guard .
what do you think , obelix ?
now where did he go ?
obe ?
obe .
obelix !
not to short ?
no no .
so you' re from gaul ?
yes .
been pretty hefty there lately ...
obe ...
obelix ...
h !
h !
asterix !
obelix , i' m sure that' s forbidden .
come down at once .
how nice ...
come down .
you' re being childish .
you look so small down there .
don' t be stupid .
get off that sphinx .
i' m going to take a walk on his head .
wise guy .
broken nose .
great .
remarkable .
congratulations , obelix .
you' ve outdone yourself this time .
we could attach it again .
really ?
that' s a great idea .
with what ?
did you see the size of that thing ?
yes , it' s a rock .
a cliff .
what am i saying ?
a peninsula .
stop making everything so complicated and find a solution .
you' re so clumsy , obelix .
luckily no one saw us .
let the greek balm you .
imhotep .
tep .
help me , i only have two arms .
was that lightning ?
i told you i saw lightning .
i' m not crazy .
done .
no one will find it there .
fine , let' s get out of here .
come on , dogmatix .
not a word about this to getafix .
nothing happened .
no .
nothing .
hey , my pyramids ...
seeing the palace is progressing faster than planned ... ... we demand , which is perfectly normal ... ... an extra day off .
you understand me , put yourself in my place adis .
my name' s edifis .
what did i say ?
itineris , i don' t understand anything .
try to move a little .
now ?
no .
how about now ?
and now ?
try it .
do you understand me now ?
because ... ... i' ve been having that problem a lot lately .
are you alright , obe ?
i' m hungry .
how could the build such a thing ?
stone upon stone .
indeed .
gauls ...
feel like visiting the pyramid ?
for free .
not sure if we can learn anything .
they say it' s extraordinary .
we' re not in a hurry .
stay here , dogmatix .
guard getafix .
if you' re good , i' il give you a bone .
don' t loose track of me .
you won' t get out of this labyrinth alive .
watch it , the corridors are very narrow .
you can' t be too fat .
no one is fat .
on your right , anubis .
touching .
the god of the dead .
through here .
come , distinguished guests , go in here .
these hieroglyphs are beautiful .
after you .
enter .
indeed .
no !
no !
you' il never get out of here .
this tomb will be your tomb !
no way out .
we are stuck .
this tomb will be your tomb !
nice one .
i' m too good .
i knew it .
a free visit .
anyway , enough things to read .
hieroglyphs all look alike .
no .
look , obelix , the colours ... are beautiful .
that' s all really nice , but ... ... if we don' t find a way out soon ... ... we' il have all eternity to figure them out .
that' s that .
if they get out of here ... ... i swear i' il never shave my head again .
first of all we have to get that door open .
but considering the size ...
here , obelix ... ... for the first time you can have some magic potion ..
really ?
that' s what we said didn' t we .
one , two , three drops .
that' s enough .
well ...
that didn' t seem to do anything .
no , it' s geta .
yes , i' m here .
here .
we' re running in circles .
the pharaoh' s had splendid architects .
we' re in a serious situation here .
very serious .
i' m starting to get hungry .
what do those hieroglyphs mean ?
there' s no time to find out , we have to get out of here .
we must set our priorities straight .
i' m reporting to mister asterix that' s i' m hungry .
i keep myself busy to forget i' m hungry .
i forgot mister obelix' s stomach was more important .
wild boars and fights , that' s all he needs .
mister asterix knows everything better .
yes , maybe .
i' m reporting to mister asterix ... ... who wanted to visit the pyramid that this wouldn' t have happened in a menhir .
2 sestertius for that logic .
what' s keeping them ?
the stones are loaded .
we have to leave .
i was excited .
i was just saying something .
mea culpa .
no , i said mea culpa .
it also could have happened in a menhir .
in any case , i can' t get us out of this place .
my friends , i fear this is the end of our adventures .
could someone light a torch ?
no , i have the amulets , but that' s not going to help .
i' m sorry for edifis .
i' m sorry for dogmatix .
or not , dogmatix ?
dogmatix ?
yes , so ?
don' t blame me for bringing him !
his sense of smell lead him to us .
so he can get us out of here .
that' s true !
dogmatix , listen very carefully .
if you get us out of here , i' il give you a pile full of bones .
yes !
that' s good ...
dogmatix !
excuse me , we' re fortunate you brought him .
sometimes i think he understands everything i say .
and they returned to the construction site ... ... aboard ships loaded with stones .
we' re going slowly .
very slow .
too slow .
at this speed we won' t be back in time for the wild board banquet ... ... lentils aren' t that great ...
the nile is an unpredictable river ... ... sometimes impetuous , sometimes quiet .
i wonder if you know this nice egyptian poem .
nile , nile , nile ...
what' s he doing ?
men !
we' re seaworthy again .
hip hip hip ...
hurrah .
hip hip hip ...
hurrah .
watch out !
by toutatis , i know he fell ... ... in a cauldron of magic potion ... ... but he' il never cease to amaze me .
hip hip hip ... hurrah ...
stop it .
and construction was ready to start again .
edifis knew he would be finished in time ... ... which , in the field of construction , was rare in those days .
one sip a person .
just one sip a person .
fake potion is being spread .
same consistency , same colour , but it' s pumpkin soup .
the only real potion , is the one you get from the druid ... ... around the cauldron .
thirty minutes from here .
this tomb will be your tomb .
not bad .
jackals , die like jackals " .
but that' s jackals twice .
what ?
they say hyenas ?
locked up in the pyramid ?
i don' t understand .
they' re magicians .
you need supernatural powers to get out of there .
they' re tuff , those barbarians .
i need an idea .
got one .
i have a terrible idea .
two .
even three .
i' ve got a whole bunch of ideas .
i' m so good .
i don' t like that laugh .
it frightens me .
get to work !
that' s not even close to the luxurious garden we need .
getamanix , you don' t have any potion to speed things up ?
like seeds for example ... ... that grow into palm trees within no time ?
no , potions aren' t the solution to everything .
some things can' t be changed .
nature needs time to turn the seed ... ... with sun and water , into a bud ... ... and then ... ... that bud ...
please .
please .
it can' t go any faster .
yes , fantastic !
can someone get me down from this tree ?
they started again ?
i' m not happy either .
i also want edifis to fail , for personal reasons .
i was thinking i could be of some assistance maybe .
after we' ve struck a fair deal ...
not here .
in my tent .
i' m listening .
honourable caesar , if i see to it the construction of the palace fails .. ... you' il appoint me and i' il finish the job in 2 months .
that way you win the bet and cleopatra is humiliated .
alright , if you finish it after 4 months .
three , i can' t work any slower .
fine , but not any sooner , or you' il have to pay a compensation .
that' s a deal , honourable caesar .
how were you planning to sabotage the construction .
with this .
what shall i wear tonight ?
careful , it' s very , very tepid .
a gift for the queen of queens .
as a token of honour to the queen of queens .
getafix , obelix and asterix .
how sweet .
can i open it ?
oh , that' s tepid .
a cake .
tonight' s desert .
modest meal , 40 dancers ... ... 80 musicians and 300 simple dishes .
i don' t like crowds either .
dinnertime !
ah wild boar ...
finally some normal food .
yes .
with lentils .
that' s not really allowed .
it' s pork more or less .
we' il pretend we don' t know .
nobody moves .
we' re here to arrest the gauls .
come on , for three wild boars .
i' il beat them up and then we' il eat .
no , wait .
wait !
you' re going to fight the whole garrison ?
why not ?
that' s illegal too ?
you can' t do anything around here .
edifis is right .
we' re going to see cleopatra .
yes , nice opportunity to see the palace .
i' il stay here to keep an eye on the fire .
it tends to go out .
that' s why i want to stay .
everything is tasted beforehand .
your scheme failed , gauls .
my taster was poisoned by your cake .
we didn' t send any cake .
what cake ?
that cake .
i don' t see fifty others .
the wild boars , ok , but for that ...
silence !
you tried to kill me .
you will die .
by toutatis !
we are innocent .
you have some nerve .
ridiculous .
we work ... ... all day , breath dust ...
eat lentils ...
yes , no ...
yes we do , lentils .
yes , but ...
we didn' t send you any poisonous cake .
a cake like that we would have eaten ourselves .
silence !
this is ridiculous .
if she doesn' t want to hear it ... ... you don' t say anything .
for now .
take them away .
and give the crocodiles an appetizer .
i' m hungry .
i' m hungry .
hungry !
when i said hello , she turned her head .
we used to laugh , said cuckoo ... and now ... ... all of a sudden ... ... she won' t look at me anymore .
i' m a stranger to her .
cleopatra and you said cuckoo ?
he' s not talking about cleopatra , but about a courtesan .
the one with the nice braid .
wouldn' t surprise me if he were in love .
i' m not in love .
i want to tell her i had nothing to do with it .
it' s a juridical thing .
juridical , yes .
of course .
stop .
cuckoo , i love you .
it' s great to look so stupid ...
subtle ...
sometimes you can be really nice , and sometimes we think you' re ... ... a fat idiot ...
who' s an idiot ?
no idea .
drink .
a sip of antidote .
obelix , not everything .
a sip .
yes , a sip .
now ...
obelix , open the door .
i didn' t drink it all .
get out of my way .
yes , and when you come back you' il bring me a suit ...
egyptians are mad .
we ask them to get out of the way but they don' t move .
and ?
i' m ready .
i' m sick of standing in profile all the time .
can' t you sketch my front for a change ?
like this ...
modern art ...
please ?
can we ?
i' d better leave .
gauls , since you want to see my demise ... ... i' il , by osiris , show you how a queen dies .
no , by toutatis , listen to us first .
where are your courtesans ?
why ?
no reason .
i' m sure the cake wasn' t poisoned .
i think it' s very tasty even .
obelix , cut 3 pieces of cake .
we said three piece .
one ...
go on .
two .
and three .
obviously .
and ?
you can see it' s not poisoned .
tell your courtesans .
especially the one with the braid .
her name is guimieukis .
guimieukis .
i had a dream last night .
i' d won a million sestertius .
i bought , shoes .
too big , and ugly too .
unbelievable .
and weird , because ...
that egyptian architect and his proposition ...
ilemauris ?
artifis .
yes .
incompetent .
he hasn' t achieved anything .
send one of ours , to spy and snoop around .
thinking of someone in particular , o caesar ?
someone sneaky ...
cartapus !
yes .
caesar , meet cartapus .
our best spy .
ave caesar .
power and prosperity .
cartapus is a professional .
the queen of camouflage .
if i look that way , you can see me .
when i look this way , you don' t .
you can .
you can' t .
you can .
can' t .
can' t .
can .
incredible .
you can' t .
can' t .
can .
you can .
can' t .
you can a little .
amazing .
yes .
she wasn' t even trying hard .
they mock me .
four months ...
don' t rush me .
i' ve been waiting four months .
my mother will kill me .
i have connections .
come one , stay calm .
don' t touch me !
impossible to stay calm .
malococsis , tomorrow i' il finish everything .
i' il even give you a discount .
i' d like that .
he' d like that .
if you' re not there tomorrow , i' d rather not be in your place .
and ?
the magic potion gives them incredible strength .
i drank it and now i' m superman .
superwoman .
you don' t believe me , o caesar ?
we shall see .
malivestus !
slap her .
caesar will personally deal with this matter .
the dice is cast .
alea jacta est .
excuse me .
in the name of caesar !
we know the gauls are hiding here .
i demand that appendix , olympix and mannekepix ...
no , their names are asterix ...
their names don' t matter !
if they don' t surrender immediately we' il attack .
we' re here to help cleopatra .
by toutatis , we' re not leaving until the work is finished .
don' t be so aggressive .
maybe we can talk !
we' il kill you all .
i knew it .
jeanclaudus .
prepare the troops .
and show no mercy .
antivirus .
my name is antivirus .
arm yourself .
one , two , three ... ... four , six ... five ...
come on .
get in line .
here .
put him in some shade .
so , amateurs , coming to see the professionals at work ?
yes , alright .
yes , if you' re not used to it , it' s rather impressive .
getamanix , magic potion for the workers .
it' s their day off .
so ...
this is the palace , there are the gardens .
and there is the temple with the sphinxes .
that' s not a good drawing .
no , i' m merely sketching .
in perspective it' s more like ...
i would have drawn it more in profile .
yes , you do it all the time ...
those romans are mad .
because of the violence in the next scene ... ... we prefer to broadcast this documentary .
in contrary to common belief ... ... the langoustine feeds exclusively on shellfish .
which doesn' t bother his humanity .
careful ...
one got through .
dogmatix , attack !
leave me alone .
i' ve been beaten already .
alright .
sir , we don' t allow such speeding here .
we' re not in rome .
ave caius c+ , they withstood the attack ... ... but some managed to get very close to the enemy .
bravo , brave soldiers .
they shouldn' t have challenged me .
and what' s that ?
we got right up to them ... ... but they were nice .
they let us go without beating us too much .
what will we do now ?
i' m asking , as an amateur .
attack again !
caius c+ , i' m not sure that' s a good idea .
the gauls are invincible ... ... i think we better give up ...
i' m very disappointed by your attitude , centurion antiquarus .
antivirus .
my name is antivirus .
no one humiliates the roman empire .
if it' s attacked ... ... the empire counterattacks .
he' s mad .
he hurt my throat .
it' s too quiet .
i don' t like that .
i prefer a little commotion .
stop !
war machines ...
take your positions .
how low can you go .
beautiful landscape .
not good , not bad either .
fire !
destroy the palace !
ready ?
ready .
when i lower my arm ... ... you fire .
easy .
there ... bingo .
my palace !
i wonder why all this violence is necessary .
no , it' s fine .
come !
fine .
excellent .
with such equipment it' s easy .
it' s not about the equipment .
oh yes it is .
no .
yes .
no .
yes .
no .
yes .
my palace is turned into a ruin .
go on , romans , fire .
we no longer care .
you missed .
you shoot like girls .
we' re still here .
we must inform cleopatra .
she could force ... ... caesar to stop .
no .
no .
no .
no .
yes .
yours sincerely ...
i have an idea .
dogmatix will bring the message .
dogmatix will bring the message .
that dog ?
you want me to die ?
edifis is right .
i mean ... it' s a dog .
he got us out of the pyramid .
go on , dogmatix .
take this message to cleopatra .
he' s too young to understand .
i' m hit .
never mind , i' m fine .
men !
we' re seaworthy yet again .
aboard our trusty old dragon boat .
it' s an extraordinary mast , subtle as a bird .
hoist the sail .
yes .
no .
no .
too far .
i' m amazed .
it should hold .
a big sip .
i' m leaving but i' il be back .
hurry and be careful .
hold on , dogmatix .
run , asterisque , run !
alarm !
i know that one .
he' s a grumpy man .
shields !
javelin !
why isn' t he stopping ?
the magic potion !
citebus , trolleybus , get him !
quickly !
go on !
but that' s not my name .
obelix is alone .
go help him .
i' m strong now ?
edifis ... ... prepare your sarcophagus .
double evasion .
pryadonis , violence ... ... never solved anything .
stop talking .
wait , i didn' t drink any magic potion .
you lost .
are you sure ?
very sure .
ok .
no , no !
i beg you , no !
i' m artifis , and i beat edifis ...
the magic potion has worn off .
cleopatra will never get the message .
your family is fine ?
yes .
imhotep .
and your father ?
fine , imhotep .
and your sister .
everything' s ok .
imhotep .
what has become of your nephew ?
he' s doing fine , imhotep .
and how' s business ?
sorry , i' m borrowing this cart for a moment .
many customers ?
enough , imhotep .
how useful .
we can' t catch him .
he' s got one with 2 horses .
i can' t go any faster .
why does everyone always shout " ja , ja " ?
catch me if you can .
how will you get up ?
like this .
fighting is ridiculous .
let' s work together .
a lion doesn' t cooperate with a cockroach .
what ?
a lion , you know , doesn' t cooperate ... ... with a cockroach .
i understood : " an ion ... ... doesn' t calculate .
that means nothing to me .
no .
attack !
when i said lion i meant myself !
i knew that .
what' s going on ?
the lion doesn' t cooperate with the cockroach .
who' s the lion now ?
say it to my face , if you' re a man .
everything ok ?
by jupiter , a moment ago he was still here .
we' re going home .
gone is gone .
i' ve had it with edifis .
where are we going ?
to cleopatra .
i' m scared .
yes , play it smart .
i know cleopatra very well .
watch me .
i' m afraid i have no choice .
one , two , three , four , five .
antelope and lion .
what does the prediction say ?
a message and a loved one .
whatever .
my queen ...
malococsis .
come on in .
go , dogmatix .
give her the message .
that' s the message .
and there' s the loved one .
my queen , as you may know i' m building .
in fact , it should have been easily finished four months ago .
what ?
easily .
he can' t get away with that !
thank you , my queen , that you care so much .
by isis , he' s a sore looser .
this is typical of caesar .
but this time ... ... he' il have to accept his defeat .
we will finish in time .
no , the construction isn' t finished .
that' s exactly the problem .
i' il see to it .
you can go now , gaul .
guimieukis , show him the way .
i' il be right there .
pardon me , old man .
come , my dogmatix .
come , my gaul .
i believe you don' t understand my problem .
it' s that way .
straight ahead .
be careful .
yes .
everything will be destroyed .
everything will be fine tranquilum .
that attack was a good idea , wasn' t it ?
yes , not bad .
asterix is coming back .
when i lower my arm ...
well ?
don' t know .
a reflex .
how did it go ?
cleopatra got the message .
great .
the magic potion took this long to wear off ?
well , it' s like this ...
you had a taste of the best magic potion there is .
good .
come , my dog .
dogmatix just came back and he succeeded .
i was sure he could do it .
there' s a little pink ...
ave caesar .
somebody wishes to see caesar .
who ?
someone .
i understand .
my queen , what a pleasant surprise .
enough !
i rushed over here ... ... without changing , when i heard about what' s going on here .
what happened ?
when you accept a bet you have to play fair .
the gauls may help me .
i never said ...
if i may say something ...
just one ...
this is not conquered territory .
i demand the romans leave the construction alone ... ... and repair all damages .
but ...
silence !
immediately !
so what do we do now ?
what she said .
we leave and repair the damages .
of course , naturally .
i wouldn' t want her to sniff her nose at me .
no matter how lovely it is .
the romans are leaving .
that' s good news .
they' re leaving already ?
incredible that each of those romans leaves his footprint in the sand ...
excuse me , i couldn' t help myself .
that' s alright .
for the first time romans and egyptians were working together ... ... on the construction of the palace .
and just in time ... ... when the last grain of sand fell ...
what are you going to do now , edifis ?
i still have to finish my work for malococsis ...
you don' t have to worry about the crocodiles any longer .
that' s why it could take a bit longer .
not too lang .
can' t become a habit in this line of business .
caesar admitted his defeat ...
i bow to the most beautiful queen of all ... ... and to the egyptian people that after the ro ...
and i bow to the egyptians who are the greatest people of all .
cleopatra kept her promise to edifis .
let him be covered with gold !
that was the deal .
cover me with gold .
the queen gave getafix ... ... valuable manuscripts from her library in alexandria .
your nose ...
your majesty is too good , by belenos ...
otis also gave the palace a modern touch .
what' s this little chamber for ?
it' s otis ' invention .
it' s the " no effort " .
we chose that name when we noticed ... ... that people can go up and down with no effort .
speak for yourself .
oh it tickles when it stops .
by jupiter .
i want to explore every room of this miracle with you .
the palace is huge , caesar .
it consists of 162 rooms .
it could take a while .
what do you think cleopatra and sesam are doing ?
caesar .
cae sar .
nothing unpleasant .
as an exception to the rule ... ... the banquet , that concludes all of asterix' s adventures ... ... didn' t take place in gaul but in egypt .
those big shrimps are nice .
homarus .
obelix .
that' s the pha ra o .
because his name is o.
his name is o and comes from phara .
it' s o from phara .
the guy' s name is o.
he says he' s from phara . from phara .
like the pharaoh .
the boss ... our boss .
you have a lovely moustache .
is it real ?
yes .
it' s nothing .
you just let it grow .
like your braids ... ... which are nicer then obelix' s .
thanks .
you know how to please a woman .
that' s a local custom .
in gaul .
good evening .
your name , please .
what for ?
it' s a private party .
i' ve got a list .
i' m julius caesar .
sorry , impossible .
there must be a problem , because ...
excuse me .
make some room .
a warm evening ?
are you alone ?
we' re with two , four , six , eight .
it' s crazy .
good evening .
there' s a problem ... ... i have to be on that list .
how do you spell your name ?
c , a , e , s , a , r. julius .
cetaparis , seinesaindenis , c+ , but i can' t find any ...
c+ , that' s me .
are you c+ ?
why didn' t you say so ?
nice harness .
thanks .
i' il see you inside .
are you ok ?
have a good time .
can you look for julius ?
j , u , l , i , u , s.
sir , i' m not ...
i work here .
i don' t know , but i know ...
there' s one of my amphorae inside .
with a j ?
u , l , i , u , s.
yes , that' s right .
julius caesar .
at the queen' s table .
good evening .
is it in alexandria or at alexandria ?
because in the south of gaul there' s a city called avignon .
there' s a beautiful bridge .
and people say " at avignon " .
are you a courtesan ?
yes , and i used to do other things too .
i can talk without moving my lips .
it' s funny , the way ...
i have another one ... here .
every part of your face hides something beautiful .
a rose out of your ear ...
a sphinx from your nose .
that' s the pharaoh .
o is his name .
and he' s from phara .
that' s where he comes from .
where he was born .
the pharaoh , because his name is o.
help !
