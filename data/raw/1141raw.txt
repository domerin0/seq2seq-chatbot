oh , i' m sorry .
it' s so hot in here ... and i can' t figure this stupid thing out .
i signed the papers .
wow .
how are you feeling ?
terrible .
francis was there .
obviously , he was there .
it was really hard to see him .
and he signed so fast .
i at least pretended to look things over one last time .
he sounds terrified to me .
it' s going to take a while .
i mean , nine years , rafi .
you can' t just walk away from that kind of time .
the crazy thing is ...
i' m out of this marriage , what , five minutes ... and all of a sudden i just ...
i find myself thinking about ... a baby .
why now ?
and why didn' t i think about this when i was married ?
well , i mean , you know ... on a certain level , you knew this was not the right man .
so you were protecting yourself in that way .
that was a good thing .
oh , rafi , you' re coming alive again .
you know , you just want all the things ... that you had to forget that you could have .
that' s a very good place to move into .
and the baby thing will happen ... when it' s the right time .
but just focus on the now .
for now .
hey , dave , it' s morris ...
listen , i got a favor to ask you .
i went out with this girl the other night .
and she told me never to call her again .
you know how that goes .
so i' m gonna need you to come with me this time .
don' t freak out , all right ?
i don' t know how to get to bay ridge .
i' m not sure .
bye .
i don' t understand why i have to be a part of this .
you have an incurable sickness .
it' s okay , though .
i understand .
but why am i being involved ?
how are you being involved ?
because i' m in the car .
i' m going to be a witness to this .
that makes me an accessory .
what , like a handbag ?
morris .
so who' s it this time ?
you know what ?
don' t ...
i don' t wanna know .
don' t tell me .
her father' s probably in waste management or something .
what i would like to know is why no girl will go out with you twice .
one date , it' s over .
what do you do ?
what do you say ?
you know , it' s a mystery to me , too .
are you a hermaphrodite ?
do you have hantavirus ?
this is it .
come on .
all right , just make this quick .
i gotta meet michelle at the movies a little later .
michelle ?

## [ music playing ]
it' s locked .

the door .
it won' t open .
so , does this happen to you a lot ?
actually , not often enough .
so what are we gonna do ?
wait till somebody comes out .
right .
thank you .
yeah .
so , how long have you guys been dating ?
couple of weeks .
we' re not dating .
okay .
next question .
i mean , we only went out twice before this .
do you consider that dating ?
i guess i did .
i' m sorry .
i mean , to me , dating sounds more serious .
like you' ve already been going out for a couple of months , like ...
maybe you don' t live together ... but you definitely stay over a couple of nights a week .
you don' t worry about who paid for the last meal anymore .
you' ve seen each other pee , you know ?
more serious kind of stuff .
then what do you call this ?
well , that' s it .
there are officially no cute boys left here .
all right .
it' s so nice to get out .
it was nice to meet you .
nice to meet you , too .
dave .
very nice to see you .
good night .
bye .
nice to meet you .
one , two , three , four .
just fucking call her .
hello .
hello ?
hello ?
hi .
it' s dave ...
bloomberg .
did you just call me ?
yes .
we get disconnected ?
no .
did you hang up ?
uh huh .
they say it' s better to lie sometimes ... but i can' t really do that when i' m this nervous .
i think i need to be in a better place .
i like it better this way .
i' ve been around enough lying to say so .
you had a lot of liars in your life , huh ?
what ?
shit .
would you like to go out to dinner with me tomorrow ?
david , i' m making a sandwich .
do you want one ?
no , i' m fine !
who' s that ?
that' s my roommates .
so , do you want to have dinner ?
yes .
yeah ?
i' il call you tomorrow .
okay .
okay .
bye .
bye .
okay , grandma .
so , what kind of sandwich are we talking about ?
hi , i' m here to see rafi gardet .
my name' s dave .
raphael .
it' s damien .
yeah .
there' s a ...
it' s dave .
dave here to see you .
okay .
she' il be right down .
bubbles here , i like that .
it' s a good touch .
is that wool ?
looks itchy .
is it itchy ?
i think it' s the biggest contradiction in the world .
jews eat carp , okay ?
who eats carp ?
they don' t serve it in restaurants .
have you ever seen carp on a menu in your life ?
please , answer me honestly .
no .
no .
you know why ?
because it' s disgusting .
but for all this terrible food ... you' ve never seen a people so obsessed with it in your life .
it' s a remnant .
i' il bet every immigrant group ... that was displaced by world war ii puts a lot of emphasis on food .
i mean , it was scarce .
carp is cheap , right ?
it was probably a staple of their diet .
what is this , the history channel ?
you trying to kill this for me ?
come on .
sorry .
fine , go ahead .
okay , so my friend morris ...
so i think you' re gonna love this place .
it' s beautiful .
no one' s ever there .
can i see some id ?
sure .
love when that happens .
yeah .
i wish i still got carded .
excuse me , dave .
yes .
quick question for you .
how old are you ?
actually , i don' t speak vietnamese .
why do you ask ?
are you being evasive ?
i am trying .
you know , i don' t tell my age .
i think people get way too caught up with the number .
i' m 37 .
did you know that ?
you know , i hadn' t really thought about it .
sure you hadn' t .
look , i know you' re a lot younger than me .
i' d just like to know , you know , how much .
okay , let me guess .
twenty nine .
no .
really ?
older ?
you don' t look 30 to me .
thanks .
i' m 23 .
no , you' re not .
i don' t believe you .
let me see the license .
oh , my god .
you' re a child .
taxi !
i have t shirts older than you .
they let me drive , okay ?
yeah , with a parent in the car .
how come you seem so much older to me ?
i don' t know .
i don' t know if i can do this .
come on .
can you hold this ?
sure .
are we gonna get in trouble ?
i hope so .
this place is amazing .
i can' t believe i' ve walked by this for 15 years ... and i didn' t know it was here .
let' s have it .
what ?
how did you know ?
okay .
his name is david ... and he' s really , really nice .
i mean , sweet .
and i met him a few days ago and he asked me out on a date .
and we went out to dinner ... and we kissed .
i like beer .
good .
i mean , no , i ...
i never used to .
i had to learn , ' cause nobody in my family drinks .
you' re lucky , ' cause everyone in my family drinks .
no , i mean , my family , they don' t drink anything .
it' s like salt lake city .
they' il have maybe a sip of wine every friday night , on the sabbath .
that' s it , though , and it' s manischewitz .
i' ve never had that .
you like high c ?
' cause my mom , she likes to keep the wine in the fridge ... and we' il still be drinking it three months later .
a good chardonnay can last ...
yeah .
it' s red .
that' s not good .
hey , by the way .
things to avoid .
okay .
beginning sentences with , " my mom .
right .
i' m all over it .
however old you are , i have to say ...
i haven' t had this much fun in a really long time .
i' m glad i met you .
i gotta tell you ... you' re making me nervous in a way i' m not really familiar with .
my god , lisa , what am i doing ?
i only got divorced last week .
easy , easy .
it' s okay .
you didn' t tattoo his name on your toochis , did you ?
do you want to save some of that for later ?
what ?
what is it ?
he' s ...
he' s only 27 .
and ?
what do you mean , " and " ?
i mean , that' s 10 years different .
he could be my brother .
if he were one year younger , he could be your brother .
aren' t you embarrassed for me ?
i mean ... this just smells of " pool boy at sandals resort .
oh , it' s fine .
it might even do you some good ... if you know what i mean .
lisa !
what ?
there' s nothing to be ashamed of .
you' re both at your sexual peak .
so you approve ?
yes .
unequivocally .
yes , this is good .
but it can' t really go anywhere .
you know , i mean , he' s ...
he' s so young .
yeah , but it' s a little early to be worrying about that .
and besides , you' re not looking to get married next week , right ?
enjoy your life a little bit .
you deserve this .
twenty seven .
hell , i deserve this !
no , she' s not jewish .
mom , i' m not trying to kill you .
yes , i want you to be alive to see your grandchildren .
your jewish grandchildren , mom .
no , i didn' t know that you wanted to be buried in israel .
mom , i' m not gonna talk about this over the phone right now , okay ?
i' il see you tomorrow .
i love you , too .
bye .
hey , dave .
hi , d.
where' s mom ?
i told you to hang it up , dinah !
hey , guys .
you left the bathroom light on this morning .
jeff rosenberg' s son got engaged yesterday .
to a speech therapist .
hey , boychik .
hi , dad .
we have to talk about our last phone conversation .
mom .
it' s good to see you , too .
i' m not kidding around .
okay , i can ...
i can just tell that this is gonna be ... some sort of disciplinary action , not a talk .
all right .
we' il be sure to make it a talk , then .
now can you help your sister set the table , please ?
sure .
and take the wine out of the fridge .
has he called yet ?
the next night .
nice .
i know .
i' m not used to this .
did you guys make a plan to go out again ?
he wanted to have dinner with me tomorrow night .
but i have a flight early sunday morning .
that' s a bit drastic for a bad date .
do you really need to leave the country ?
this kid' s funny .
please don' t use that word .
right , sorry .
he' s humorous .
what are you doing ?
drinking .
he' s having scotch .
mom , i' m 23 .
it' s fine .
what , what , what ?
tomorrow , gonna go to shul , gonna pray that everybody ... is gonna have a happy ...
dinah , you know , since you told me about computers ...
mom , let him finish .
he' s finished .
i' ve become so ...
then why do you have to do this ?
there are so many other women that you could go out with .
and i' ve encouraged you to branch out ... in any other way that you like , but just not this .
why do you have to do this ?
what do you mean , " do this " ?
do what ?
incur the wrath of god ?
why are you getting yourself into trouble ?
i' m not getting married , mom .
i' m just seeing what' s out there .
you make it out like we live in the warsaw ghetto .
it' s the upper west side .
we' re strong in numbers here .
so you' re still planning on marrying someone jewish ?
yes .
sure .
okay ?
but then i don' t understand why you need to go down this road .
you may end up getting hurt for nothing .
or worse , hurting her .
don' t you value your culture and your history ?
well , it' s not one or the other , mom .
but if you' re smart enough to know ... that it makes sense to marry someone from the same background ... and it does , any of the studies will show you that ... as far as the divorce rates go .
then you should be smart enough to know ... not to start something where nothing can come of it .
you' re only going to make a mess .
i can' t even believe what you' re saying .
do you hear what you' re saying ?
what ?
you' re a therapist .
you would never tell that to a patient .
not true , not true .
i encourage my patients to have relationships ... within their respective faiths .
it' s easier .
i encourage them to go to mosque , or church , or whatever .
i think religion is ... paramount in a person' s life .
okay , well , yes ... but encouraging them is different from discouraging them .
and i know that you draw the line there .
would you tell one of your patients not to date someone ... that they don' t think they' re gonna marry ...
oh , quit asking me what i tell my patients .
they' re not my children .
how old is she ?
she' s 27 .
what ?
she' s four years older than you ?
oh , david .
drop it now .
it' s only going to end badly .
maybe if you met her , you might think ...
i' m not going to meet her .
oh , my god .
are you out of your mind ?
mom , do you ...
you sound like an after school special .
don' t do this .
i' m doing it .
on your own then .
hey , what' s up , man ?
cool .
do you need anything or ...
no ?
go on up .
she' s expecting you .
thank you .
give me ...
five ?
thumbs up ?
smile ?
no ?
we' il get there .
hi .
hi .
come on in .
thanks for the soup .
yeah .
it' s chicken noodle .
it' s hot .
wow .
this place is huge .
i' m not even going to ask what you pay .
i don' t want to know .
it' s rothko .
i' ve never seen this one before .
what year is this ?
1954 .
it' s probably my single favorite piece of art .
yeah , i love how he never titled any of his work .
it' s beautiful .
luminous .
## [ music playing ]
what is this ?
sentimental mood .
you never heard coltrane before ?
no .
what , am i in trouble now ?
no .
no , it' s just ...
he' s a pretty famous jazz musician .
oh .
so , is this that negro music that everybody' s talking about ?
' cause i had no idea .
i have to wake up in five hours .
do you want me to go ?
take off your sweater .
wait .
does this involve dancing ?
' cause my corns , they' ve been killing me and ...
take it off .
it' s coming with me .
all right .
i really like her .
she' s only been gone two days , she comes back tomorrow .
i miss her already .
i never felt this before .
it' s just ' cause you haven' t slept with her yet .
no , that' s definitely not it .
i really like her , man .
i don' t know , i mean ...
i think i could love her .
what ?
whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa .
wait , what was i saying ?
i don' t know , man .
there is something about this girl ...
like , you know that feeling that you get ... when you' re in a room with someone ... and even though you may not know them ... or understand them completely ... you just know that you' re in the presence of greatness ?
you know ?
like when you come to my apartment .
and she old , man , she a time fighter .
she' s so fine , bro .
i don' t know .
i just feel like it' s gonna end badly , i do .
you sound like my mother .
yeah .
hey , morris !
all right !
what the hell am i listening to you for ?
i' m in a bakery shopping for a pie ... so you can put it in some girl' s face ... who wouldn' t let you get down her pants .
when was the cream pie made ?
today .
today ?
yeah .
nice .
i' il take that one .
awesome .
so what' s with dave ?
is he really serious about this girl , or what ?
i don' t know .
so what is she ?
catholic ?
episcopalian ?
i didn' t ask .
would you prefer one denomination over another ... as far as the love of christ goes ?
your father' s gonna flip .
yeah .
and it' s too bad your mom isn' t around for this .
it would have gone over real big with her , too .
so , what are we gonna do ?
i don' t know .
have you ever had ikura with quail egg ?
no .
what is that ?
i swear it' s like having sex .
that' s a bold claim .
you want to try it ?
how am i gonna say no now ?
that' s amazing .
i know .
what ?
so , how was your trip ?
who cares ?
okay .
well , this sounds really good .
that' s what i' m hearing .
it was amazing .
he' s really very sweet .
i didn' t have an orgasm , though .
completely normal .
there are so many trust issues there .
you just have to give it time .
i' m willing to do the work .
god damn it .
do you still worry about his age ?
definitely .
i mean , i was thinking last night , there are some countries ... where i could get arrested for this .
i mean , 23 ?
i thought you said he was 27 .
did i ?
i did .
i' m sorry .
i lied to you about that .
why do you think you lied ?
i was ...
i mean , i am embarrassed by his age .
i mean , he' s just so young .
what does he do ?
he' s an artist .
i' m not an artist .
i thought you said you were a painter .
no .
i said i like to paint .
but it' s a hobby .
i mean , you have to work , too .
he doesn' t call himself that , but that' s what he is .
he has some issue with it .
his family doesn' t support him in his work at all .
hmm .
where does he live ?
grand street .
lower east side .
i haven' t been there yet .
he has roommates , and so i' m not exactly running over .
okay .
our time is up .
and i will see you on ...
on monday .
of course .
are you okay ?
yes .
no .
yes .
i mean , i' m fine , because i have to be somewhere .
okay .
bye .
bye .
shit , shit , shit ... shit , shit , shit , shit .
oh , shit .
so what the hell am i supposed to do now , end treatment ?
keep going ?
bring them in for a couples session ?
well , if this doesn' t go anywhere ...
and i really don' t think it will .
then you' il be relieved you stayed with her now .
if you end her treatment ... and they break up after two weeks ... you will not have served her best interests .
so what are you saying ?
that i should keep treating her ?
if you think it' s just a fling , yes .
but that sounds crazy .
is that even ethical ?
your job is to help her .
that' s your ethical boundary .
okay .
forgetting all the professional implications of the moment ... how are you feeling ?
i' m a wreck .
i' m a wreck .
rita , she' s not even jewish .
if she were jewish ... would you feel better about him dating a 37 year old divorce ?
where are we going ?
i just gotta stop by work for a second .
what' s up , gil ?
hey , what' s up , dave ?
how you doing , man ?
all right .
did you set it up ?
oh , yeah .
this is rafi .
hi .
pleasure .
gil .
## [ peach trees playing ]
oh , my god .
this is amazing .
come here .
something else i want to show you .
you' ve gotta be kidding me .
go , go , go !
quit ignoring me !
come on , dave , i' m open .
get it in there !
## [ freaks of the industry playing ]
foul , man !
foul !
stay off me .
stay off me .
i' ve told you twice now .
you' ve been warned .
hi .
it' s incredible .
it' s amazing .
i' m sorry , your bra is showing .
is it missing a button there ?
no .
no .
that' s the way it is .
you were so right about jewish men .
i mean , so attentive .
but , i mean , of course you know .
you' re married to one .
yes , but he has add .
i just can' t get over it .
i mean ...
i feel a little awkward telling you this .
but i can' t tell anyone else .
this is so ...
we have had sex on every surface of my apartment .
i mean , i haven' t had much sleep .
but he' s just so eager to please me ... and i feel the same way about him .
he makes me want to do things ...
i understand . ... that i' ve never ... wanted to do before .
i got it .
you' re gonna laugh ... but he didn' t actually know where the clitoris was .
really ?
did you show him ?
of course .
i mean , he' s so uninhibited .
just happy to learn .
he hasn' t had much experience .
he' s only been with two other women .
what ?
he' s had sex with two other women ?
yes .
can you believe that' s it ?
now i know why men go after younger women .
there' s something to it .
his youth , his body ... his naivet ... his goddamn eagerness .
i mean ...
isn' t this great ?
yeah .
it' s amazing .
listen .
i just have to say this because i' m too embarrassed to tell anyone else .
his penis ... is so beautiful , i just ... want to knit it a hat .
did you ever think ... that i would be this satisfied ?
i mean , sexually .
not like this .
are you using protection ?
oh , of course .
he brought it up .
he' s very responsible .
oh , that' s very good .
is he neat ?
what ?
does he pick up after himself ?
does he make the bed in the morning ?
does he ask before he uses the phone ?
yes .
why ?
well , you can tell a lot about a man from those things .
yeah , he' s very neat .
i mean , he does have some unusual habits , though .
hey , i' m not trying to freak you out here ... but these q tips are amazing .
guess what ?
you' re freaking me out .
what are you talking about ?
we never had these growing up .
i saw them in my mom' s bathroom , but we never used them .
how' d you clean your ears ?
didn' t .
just towel dried them , i guess .
let me see the q tip .
no .
you have to get out of here .
what kind of mother doesn' t teach their child how to clean their ears ?
pediatricians say ... that it is unhealthy for children to use them ... because it can damage the eardrum .
and it has been shown that a small amount of wax ... in the inner canal helps protect against larger debris .
i didn' t know that .
well ...
sorry .
i' m sorry .
tell me what ... what it is that you' re trying to say .
i' m just worried about where this is going .
you know , i want to give all of myself .
just let it go .
it' s so tempting .
i mean , it' s all he wants from me .
who wouldn' t want all of you , rafi ?
you are an amazing woman .
but then i think ...
i mean , he' s just too young to handle the responsibility .
i ...
i' m scared to put myself out like that .
that' s a very mature line of thought .
i' m sure his intentions are pure ... but he doesn' t sound like ... he knows exactly what it is he' s getting into .
do you think i should just cut it off right now ?
i' m not going to answer that .
look , i don' t want you to get ... the wrong idea about my family .
sensitive subject ?
no .
maybe .
all right , look .
i' ve been having trouble with my mom concerning you .
concerning me ?
yeah .
it' s just ...
i wanted her to meet you and she said no .
that' s sweet , but don' t you think ... it' s a little early to be introducing me to your mother ?
she said no ?
why ?
i ...
look , she has a problem with you not being jewish .
she won' t meet me ?
no .
why do you think i' m so upset ?
we' re not even speaking right now .
well , i don' t understand .
i thought you said she was a therapist .
i know .
how do you think i feel ?
didn' t she meet the black girl you dated ?
no way .
no , my mother doesn' t even know about that .
that was my bubi .
my dad' s mom .
david , love .
hey , bubi .
i wanted you to meet my girlfriend , radjina .
radjina , this is my bubi .
hi .
is she black ?
it' s really not that funny , okay ?
my bubi died three weeks later .
and i know she didn' t tell anybody about radjina ... but her reaction and her subsequent death ...
let me know it might be a good idea to keep that one quiet .
i swear , i think she went in the house after that ... and just hit herself over the head with the frying pan .
i mean , that' s the image i get whenever i' m doing something wrong .
just her , like , whacking away with the skillet .
i can say this much .
age aside ... he gives me more of what i really need ... than anyone else ever has .
real things .
things i never got .
it makes it hard to harp on age ... or religion or anything , because ...
i' m just happy .
yeah .
what' s wrong , david ?
i lost my job .
i' m sorry .
did you hear josh friedman got engaged to a chef ?
yes , i heard .
truffle matzo balls .
amazing .
you better tell him about the kushners , sam .
we' re trading apartments with the kushners , starting august 1st .
in miami ?
you have to find someplace else to live while we' re gone .
oh , come on .
not now .
this is the worst possible time .
and who goes to miami in august ?
that' s what i said .
come on .
what are you talking about ?
it' s beautiful this time of year .
grandpa , it' s a sauna down there and it rains every single afternoon .
the kushners are taking you for a ride .
i told you , sam .
oh , what does he know ?
it' s a condominium .
we' re going .
what ?

i really enjoyed that .
i just asked him simply , " do you know where ...
raphael gardet is ? " and he gives me all this attitude like i' m some ...
whatever .
jesus , dave .
it' s so uncool .
the guy' s a schmuck .
schmuck ?
it' s who i work for .
who are you ?
what are you thinking ?
i got cut to one day a week at work .
then i find out i gotta be out of my place on monday .
i' m gonna be broke in a month .
but i' m sorry , okay ?
i am sorry .
okay , let' s do something .
it' s friday night .
what do you want to do ?
start observing the sabbath or something ?
no .
i wanna know what a normal friday night was like for you ... before you met me .
i mean , you didn' t sit around fireplaces in the village ... drinking merlot , did you ?
actually , we stood around trash can fires in the bowery drinking 40s .
## [ music playing ]
come on .
what ?
i wanna know what you did .
show me .
are you sure ?
yeah .
## [ get money playing ]
let' s go to your place .
we never go to your place .
i got roommates , rafi .
rafi ...
i wanna see your paintings .
you' re not missing much .
convenient and weak .
## [ you can' t turn me away playing ]
i wanna go , i wanna go right now .
i want to see where you sleep when you' re not in my bed .
this is nice .
kitchen .
very grown up .
yeah .
david ?
yeah .
who are your roommates ?
is that you , david ?
yes .
go to sleep , grandma .
come on .
give me a break .
it' s embarrassing enough , all right ?
where' s the bathroom ?
bathroom' s right there .
did you eat ?
yes , i ate .
good night .
what are you doing ?
stashing all your pornos ?
yeah , and all my posters had to come down , too .
why are they all facing away ?
i don' t know .
who wants to look at my paintings all day ?
we have to talk ... about this thing you have with your art .
i mean , it' s weird .
it' s like you think it' s a sin or something .
bubi ?
i' ve decided i' m gonna be an artist .
dave .
you' re really good .
this is what you should be doing .
you' ve got to keep painting .
yeah ?
it' s not a life .
says who ?
you' re crazy .
you' re lucky .
i' m just paving the way for you .
this is the curse of the eldest child .
when it' s all over you' il be able to bring home jay z.
are you and mom talking ?
not really .
she' s just a different person these days .
what are you doing ?
i' m just dropping off some clothes .
you' re not going to stay here ?
i' m going to morris ' place .
to tell you the truth , i didn' t even think you' d want me here .
don' t be melodramatic .
this is your home .
we' re your family .
even if you did bring home jay d.
it' s jay z , mom .
whatever .
jay b , jay d ...
i have a patient coming , so be careful when you leave .
oh , i' m so sorry to keep you waiting .
did i knock ?
am i late ?
i feel like i' m late .
but no .
no .
sit , sit , sit .
what is that ?
a gun ?
no , it' s a yoga mat .
he' s moving in with me .
what ?
i thought you said ...
weren' t you just saying ... that he couldn' t provide you with the things that you needed ?
i' m still unsure .
but i think i should just give it a shot .
i mean , you always say , " just get messy in life .
at least you know you' re living . " right ?
besides , if he can' t give me what i need ... then i' il find out sooner if he' s living with me .
and he has nowhere to go .
he said that ?
his best friend has a studio .
he' s not getting along with his mother , so he can' t go home .
she hates me , by the way .
did i tell you that ?
no .
you hadn' t mentioned it .
yes , it' s this whole other thing ... that i' m trying not to even think about .
they say the children of psychoanalysts ... are the most screwed up of all .
yes , i had heard that .
so he' s moving in .
i think it' il be fun .
that' s what you said to do with this , right ?
i mean , just have fun .
that' s right .
that' s right .
what are you looking at ?
i ...
i forgot , i have a book ...
a book ...
a book i wanted to show you .
thought it might be ...
lesbians and the kabbalah ...
a match made in heaven .
wrong book .
wrong book .
wrong ...
oh , my .
oh , well , never mind .
forget it .
i' m sorry .
i am so late .
i can' t help it if you parade around ... fulfilling every working girl fantasy i' ve ever had .
you should wear a garbage bag till you get to the elevator .
hey , are we still going to the hamptons friday ?
yeah .
see you .
## [ she' s got me playing ]
great .
village people weekend .
you' il be fine .
i' ve been grooming you for this moment .
a bette davis marathon on the turner classic network hardly qualifies .
hey , you guys , they' re here .
come on .
hi .
how are you ?
hey , jason .
you look great .
you do , too .
dave , this is jason .
hi .
hi .
we' ve heard all about you .
hi .
raphael !
hello .
hello .
it' s so good to see you again .
how are you ?
i' m good .
how was the drive ?
it was good .
good .
brilliant .
palmer , this is dave .
hi .
how are you ?
great .
how are you doing ?
great .
yeah ?
is he okay ?
or ...
ignore him .
he' s just jealous he didn' t get into your pants first .
hey , what' s up ?
oh , my god !
i am so sorry .
alsayste , you junkie !
it' s so he won' t bark .
are you okay ?
yeah .
i think i' m blind .
oh , no .
gotta call the pediatrician .
all right , come on .
that stings .
that' s terrible .
this place is amazing .
i mean , everything .
every room is perfect .
look at this .
even the beds are awesome .
we' re gonna have vacation sex tonight .
what' s vacation sex , dave ?
i don' t know , but you' re gonna get it , girl .
look at this , even the breeze coming through here .
this is perfect .
is it like this for all rich people ?
no , just gay rich people .
you' re gonna get it .
oh , yeah ?
i' m gonna give it to you .
vacation sex , dave ?
please .
you are the only ... registered gay republican in new york .
it' s just a tax thing .
i' m to the left on every other issue .
i still say the democrats need their own show pushing their own agenda .
no one would watch .
i mean , there' s no blood .
i' d watch that show .
people would much rather watch some liberal be humiliated ... on the o' reilly factor .
you should go on , jason ... and thoroughly humiliate the man .
sure , he' d love me .
alsayste ?
where is he ?
i' il get him .
fiddler on a hot tin roof .
and so young .
have you carded him ?
yes , unfortunately , i have .
i think he' s great .
smart and sweet .
just needs a little seasoning .
i think he' s ...
you don' t get to say .
you' re totally infatuated with him .
maybe , but i' m still worried about you .
he is so young and you' re obviously falling for him .
so what ?
fall .
what is wrong with you ?
you look 10 years younger .
i' ve never seen you this happy .
i' m just saying , you want a baby ... and he is in no position to give you that .
you' re on the clock , rafi .
thanks , randall .
that' s sweet .
plus , he has this weird relationship with his mother ... who wants him to marry someone named rivkah or devorah .
randall , who asked you ?
besides , i think it' s interesting ... that you call their relationship weird ... when all it is , is close .
we should all be so lucky .
besides , your mother still thinks you' re straight , for christ' s sakes .
so , dave , do you care if your kids are jewish ?
i care if they' re happy .
good answer .
so , what' s up with your friends ?
this whole weekend felt like a long audition .
they' re just worried about me .
worried about what ?
how old you are , i mean ... my wanting to have a child at some point .
your moving in .
and i' m just a little nervous , that' s all .
you know how it is in new york .
your apartment' s all you have .
a few hundred square feet you can call your own .
the work' s strong , i mean , it' s realistic portraits ... and he' s only 23 , i was amazed .
sounds great .
i' d really like to take a look at his work .
is he here ?
yes , he is .
great .
he' d love that .
let me go find him .
okay .
i want you to see this .
come here .
raphael .
how are you , honey ?
how you doing ?
good to see you .
nice to see you .
have you met my friend ann ?
hi .
nice to meet you .
i' ve got my hands full .
you sure do .
gosh , she' s beautiful .
thank you .
what' s her name ?
ella .
you' re so sweet .
how old is she ?
she' s one .
oh , my goodness .
yeah , she' s a big girl .
do you have any children ?
no , i don' t have any children .
she' s just started walking .
she' s holding onto the railing ...
oh , she' s so sweet .
hey , baby .
hey .
do you know you have over 500 channels on this thing ?
i watched the malaysian grand prix today .
really ?
that' s amazing .
have you left the apartment since this morning ?
no .
why ?
he sits around all day in my apartment .
i have zero privacy when i go home .
this does not sound good .
he needs to get his own place .
yeah , but he needs a job first .
it' s about time .
i need to buy him a birthday present this week .
do you have any ideas ?
there' s this nintendo thing he keeps on talking about and ...
rafi , let me ask you something .
do you like having sex ?
don' t get nintendo .
are you coming to bed ?
yeah , right after this game .
just for a sec .
okay .
what can it hurt ?
i' ve got to get back .
we' il just look , all right ?
how much is this ?
much too much .
don' t look .
don' t even look .
may i help you ?
what ?
may i ...
no .
jack .
what ?
we have to go .
why ?
i have an appointment i forgot about .
i thought you said you didn' t ...
i just have to go , all right ?
why ?
shit !
get down , get down .
why ?
it' s a patient ?
no , it' s my lover .
yes , it' s a patient .
just be quiet .
you' re gonna have to explain this .
you know i can' t .
okay .
you' re scaring some of the customers .
just dropped a contact .
i was married to a man who couldn' t love me .
and now i' m with someone who can love me ... but he' s not really a man .
at least , not all the time .
i can see that .
maybe if i give myself to him completely ... he' il step up in the ways i need him to .
he said he knows i' m not giving all of myself ... and it' s unfair to us .
i don' t think i can do this anymore .
i' m sorry .
i just can' t .
do what ?
we need to talk , rafi .
okay .
he' s my son .
who ?
why does it say lisa metzger on your door ?
metzger is my maiden name .
you betrayed me .
yes .
i did betray your trust ... but i did it to preserve our relationship .
that seemed more important to me .
is this what you call preserving our relationship ?
it seemed at the time like the right thing to do .
what do you mean , at the time ?
how long have you known ?
five weeks , four days .
i wanted to make sure that it wasn' t just a fling .
if it was , then we would have been able to continue , but ...
now we' re having a conversation ... that will very likely end our work together .
can you see ... that i wanted to avoid having this conversation ... for your benefit ?
no .
i think you did it to control your son' s life .
no .
that' s not true .
that is not true .
i stayed in it just for you , no other reason .
i don' t believe you .
that you could give me advice to do as i please ... and then not do the same for your son is wrong .
i think you need to look at that .
thank you .
i am working on that with my therapist right now .
you let me talk to you about his penis .
trust me , that was harder for me than it was for you .
up until a few weeks ago , i didn' t even think my son had a penis .
do you realize your mother now knows intimate details about your penis ?
you told her about my penis ?
jesus , rafi .
excuse me ...
i thought it was safe to assume it wouldn' t get back to her .
she better not use that to get me home for thanksgiving .
how can you make jokes ?
what else am i gonna do ?
get angry !
be outraged !
i am , okay ?
i am angry .
i can' t believe she took it this far .
i' m just ...
i know that she cares about the people she helps .
and she cares a lot .
what is wrong with you ?
i have to draw the line there .
you' re delusional .
she' s just trying to control you .
she still is .
rafi , i' m not arguing with you .
i know she tries to control me .
i hate it .
i do .
but ...
all i' m saying is , she would never use you to do that .
you are so naive .
how could you deceive her like that ?
that was totally unethical !
how dare you ?
i care far more about her well being than you do .
that' s evident by your choice in continuing to see her .
mom .
what are you going to do now ?
live a life .
i hope you' re making the right decisions ... because you' ve got somebody else counting on you now .
that' s fine .
i can handle it .
i love her .
great .
just don' t come to me , help you clean up the mess .
i won' t .
i mean , there won' t be a mess to clean up , mom .
and i didn' t buy you q tips ... because i was trying to protect your ears .
so what ?
she' s just gonna let you live there rent free ?
no , it ain' t free .
i' m paying in other ways .
oh , my god , you' re my hero .
no , it' s not like that .
this whole thing with my mother has just killed her .
she' s , like , impossible to live with these days .
this is it .
you wanna wait outside or ...
no , i thought i' d stand next to you with some paper towels .
i' il meet you back at rafi' s .
i want you to check out her place .
she' s not going to be back for a couple of hours .
can' t believe you haven' t made page six yet .
you know what ?
this place is sick .
i know .
now i understand why you' re taking all her shit .
that' s not why .
i mean , i like living here , but that' s not the reason i' m with her .
great apartment , friends with houses in the hamptons , art connections .
those are good reasons .
you know what i mean ?
shut up .
what ?
come on , man , she' s got you tied up like it' s pelican bay .
seriously , i barely even see you anymore .
you even said it .
i' m only here right now because she' s not home .
## [ rap music playing ]
shit .
it' s her .
come on .
you' ve got to hide .
are you serious ?
i really can' t be here ?
yeah .
no .
get in the closet .
in the closet ?
get in the closet .
she doesn' t like people in her living space .
living space ?
what the hell' s living space ?
is the kitchen part of it ?
just get in the closet .
jesus christ .
what' s up ?
what are you doing home already ?
oh , i' m sorry .
would you like me to leave ?
i thought you were hanging out with morris today .
oh , yeah , drink that .
that' s good stuff , huh ?
i was .
i mean , i am .
i mean , hanging out ...
what' s wrong with you ?
you' re acting weird .
me ?
no , i' m fine .
you okay ?
is there someone here ?
what ?
no .
oh , my god , is there someone here with you ?
i' m allergic to ...
what is going on here ?
okay , okay ...
all right , look .
we were only here for a few minutes .
then i heard you coming ... and i panicked , and i told him to hide .
in the closet ?
i told him it was a bad idea .
rafi , we were only here just ...
long enough to have a beer with your pie throwing , sociopath friend ?
wait .
hey , hey .
no .
wait .
i told him ...
i told you not to come up , but you forced me .
no , you did not .
you lie ...
wait , wait , wait .
is that better or worse than a psychopath ?
what is wrong with you ?
i can' t believe i have to come home to this .
people hiding in the closet , you' re lying .
you' re a goddamn preschooler , dave !
you' ve had me on lockdown since the minute i moved in here .
what ?
yeah .
you tell me you want me here and then you treat me like an inmate .
an inmate ?
i mean , you barely carry your weight around here , dave .
i do everything and you can' t even clean up the place .
the one thing i ask of you ... is that you would tell me when you bring someone here .
rafi , this is not such a big deal , okay ?
you need to get over it .
i' m not francis .
i' m not lying to you .
i' m not cheating on you .
i' m definitely not avoiding you .
thanks .
that' s reassuring and in really , really good taste .
you know what ?
i ...
i can' t do this anymore .
you should get a dog if you wanna give orders ...
' cause i really don' t give a shit anymore !
let' s go .
i missed you like crazy .
i think we need to take a break , dave , and start seeing other people .
what ?
i can' t do this .
this just isn' t right for me ... and i can' t trust you anymore .
i was only showing him your place for a minute .
i just ...
it' s not just that .
you' re in no place to give me what i need .
i get that .
and then this whole thing with your mother ...
i don' t even know what to say about that .
it' s crazy .
but just think the reason she stopped seeing you ... is because she believes that we' re in love .
it' s just ...
it' s just not gonna work out .
at least , not now .
so that' s it ?
rafi .
you don' t look as relieved as you predicted .
are you kidding ?
i' m devastated .
i hurt my patient so that she could have a relationship with my son .
and so what happens ?
my son hurts my patient .
and now ... my patient hurts my son .
i' m totally confused about my part in this .
i think you did the right thing , lisa .
you know , even love won' t guarantee ... that they' re not going to hurt one another .
if anything , it just makes it a likelihood .
thanks for coming down .
sorry the place is such a mess .
rafi thought i' d like your work and i trust her judgment .
yeah , well , we broke up .
i' m sorry .
i didn' t know .
she didn' t say anything about it ?
no .
these are great .
do you have a gallery ?
no .
how much for the larger pieces ?
i don' t know .
i never sold one before .
i' il give you $1, 000 each for these two .
and i' il see what i can do about getting you a show .
done .
i don' t believe it .
you' re gonna be a huge painter and i get to go along for the ride .
maybe i can write this whole pie thing off as performance art .
what do you think ?
who you calling ?
rafi .
why ?
i want to tell her how it went .
plus i want to kick her a few bucks for the time i spent there .
she' il appreciate it .
what am i , chopped liver ?
i' m gonna pretend you didn' t say that .
you' re the reason ...
all right , all right .
i' m not in right now .
does this mean you' re gonna get your own place now ?
shut up .
thanks .
hey , raff , it' s me again .
listen ...
i have some amazing news for you .
please pick up .
rafi , rafi .
hello ?
## [ shelter playing ]
why don' t you call him , then ?
i like it , man .
it' s very the early years , you know ?
a little roach problem , but you can fix that .
it' s gonna look good when a& e comes to shoot the documentary .
he lived on rugalach and macaroons ... for the first four years during his blue period ...
would you shut up ? ... and then moved on to the louvre .
all right , howard hughes .
tell me to shut up again .
get dressed .
let' s go .
let' s get it moving around .
i wanna go out .
i want you to look nice .
you' ve been shut in too long .
let' s go .
pick it up .
## [ music playing ]
we' re with her .
no , you' re not .
what ?
come on , man , that' s my girlfriend right there .
back off the rope .
hey .
hold the goddamn mayo .
you know that chick ?
yeah .
don' t point .
sorry .
what' s wrong ?
we can' t get in .
hey , it' s okay .
come on .
let them in .
i love you , okay ?
i really do .
but if you don' t take advantage of this situation ...
i' m gonna seriously question your manhood .
i miss her .
get over it , okay ?
it' s been two weeks .
you don' t think she' s out here doing the same thing ?
i' m thinking the pan seared trout .
what about the salmon ?
looks good , too .
do you think it' s wild or farm raised ?
do you like carp ?
no .
i wanna dance .
go get to work , sister .
come on , shake it like a salt shaker .
go ahead .
## [ rap music playing ]
what is that ?
what is that ?
no , no .
that' s like some irene cara shit .
she ought to be wearing leg warmers .
all right , you gotta do damage control .
yeah .
this is not helping anybody .
go .
have a drink , baby .
feel better ?
much .
yes !
i' m going to use your toothbrush .
that' s okay , right ?
oh , my god .
what ?
dave .
yeah .
do you believe in jesus christ ?
## [ holding on playing ]
you' re painting .
i' m working .
i' m not doing this to piss you off , mom .
this is not an act of rebellion .
i love her .
i' m trying to make it work .
i could really use your help .
my help .
have you even heard a word i' ve said ?
i am out of this .
just let me bring her over friday night .
please .
mom , i' m begging you .
she doesn' t stop talking about you .
how much she misses you and all this stuff .
are you insane ?
there is no way .
you okay ?
mom ?
we' re here .
rafi .
what ?
what is it , sweetie ?
i missed you .
now i just realized how much .
i missed you , too .
did you ?
yes .
hello , sweetheart .
hi , mom .
thank you .
you look very nice .
okay .
coats .
what ?
oh , yeah .
jack .
ma , can audrey come over ?
no , no , no .
get off the phone .
would you get off the phone ?
all right , dad , this is rafi .
hi .
hi .
nice to meet you .
very nice to meet you .
this is my sister .
d. hi .
dinah .
hi .
i like your dress .
i heard so much about you .
yeah ?
hi , i' m blanche .
she' s my mother .
and you are ?
rafi .
rafi .
what a nice name .
thank you .
it' s for raphael , actually .
just like the painter .
painter ?
my husband , sam .
hi .
nice to meet you .
hi , sam .
nice to meet you .
watch out for him .
that' s the truth .
hope you' re hungry .
yeah .
oh , my ...
you shouldn' t have .
thank you .
thank you very much .
what a cute bag .
it' s a nice bottle , too .
look at that .
if it gets cold enough , we can drink it with dinner .
mom .
absolutely .
put it in the freezer for 10 minutes .
it' il be fine .
thank you .
god bless my daughter .
i honestly don' t know where i' d be without her .
in brooklyn , sam .
you' d be in brooklyn .
this is you next to me .
this is beautiful .
you okay , grandma ?
like i have a choice ?
you' re okay till you collapse .
i have to tell you a wonderful story .
first time i met my blanche .
in the subway .
there used to be an elevated line that ran across de kalb avenue .
i was on one side of the car ... she was on the other side of the car .
and she is wearing the dopiest hat you ever saw in your life .
she looked terrific .
i feel like i' ve heard this story once before .
only once ?
you' re lucky .
it' s an adorable story .
i like this .
how great is it that david sold his paintings ?
yes , we' re so happy for him .
yeah , right .
what ?
i never thought you had a chance in hell .
there you go .
oh , dad , really .
anyway , you should ...
you should all know that this is what i' m gonna be doing ... for the rest of my life .
really ?
no cpa .
no law degree .
no , " paging dr. bloomberg , " dad .
this is it .
i suppose you can make a living out of it .
so , i understand you' re interested in converting to judaism .
oh , my god .
good , thank you .
sure .
does this go in here ?
yes .
okay , good .
that' s good .
this is very strange .
yes , it is ...
i would say , yeah .
certainly never experienced anything even remotely like it .
so now you' ve seen that even your therapist has a crazy family .
are you kidding ?
this is what i never had .
you know , no grandparents .
no laughter around the dinner table .
no dinner , actually .
thank you for having me over .
i know this was very difficult for you .
no , it wasn' t difficult at all .
i think you' re great , rafi .
i think you' re great .
i know this is hard for you to understand , but this isn' t personal .
i just don' t want my son giving up on his faith so early .
but he wouldn' t have to .
i would want my kids to have a religious upbringing .
you know i didn' t have one .
you always said i suffered from it .
slow down .
you ... [ clearing throat ]
kids ?
with my son ?
rafi , think about what you' re saying .
i' m sorry .
sometimes i forget that you' re his mother .
i still think of you as my therapist .
what a mess , huh ?
## [ music playing ]
you know what else ?
he had , like , 20 boxes of q tips in his bathroom .
meanwhile , the rest of the place is a complete dump .
wait a minute .
this is dave you' re talking about ?
rafi' s dave ?
yeah ?
so what ?
they' re broken up .
listen to me , sue .
rafi and dave are back together now .
okay , so they' re back together .
what' s the big deal ?
the big deal is , it would kill her .
okay .
jesus , i won' t say anything .
you won' t say anything about what ?
hey .
did you sleep with sue ?
what ?
you know what ?
just call her already and go back to your own place , please .
i need quiet time .
thank you .
no , i' m not going to call her .
this is crazy .
she tells me to see other people ... and then she punishes me for taking her advice ?
screw that .
you know what ?
come on , even i can see that it' s not that you went out .
it' s who you went out with .
it' s , like , learn your fucking lesson day around here .
## [ try playing ]
jesus christ .
lock the door , please .
thank you .
magnolia .
traitors .
you have my total support in whatever you want to do .
then why do i feel like you' re still against this ?
i' m not .
i am worried .
i' m your mother .
that' s my job .
what if i decide to go through with this ?
sweetheart , you clearly have something special , you two .
i look at this relationship and i think what it' s done for you .
it' s really ...
it' s great .
you are ...
i mean , you' ve come into your own .
you' re a painter .
i get that .
rafi made me see that .
that is going to be your life .
that' s right .
that' s right .
that' s great .
but , david , you have to try to hear this .
love is not always enough .
not when you' re talking about marriage and children ... and joint checking accounts .
you' re not supposed to learn this lesson at 23 , maybe ... but you did get yourself into a complicated situation .
mom .
relationships are work .
children ... are work .
and i' m not saying love isn' t important .
it is , but ...
so what are you saying ?
i' m saying that ...
sometimes you love and you learn .
and you ... move on .
and that' s okay .
here we go .
whoops .
i' m sorry .
and ?
and it was a really ... really bad call and i wasn' t thinking .
i' m so sorry , rafi .
i' m just ...
learning this stuff as i go along , but you gotta work with me here ... because ...
can we get a minute here ?
no way .
i work here .
fine .
i' m going anyway .
look .
rafi , we might have some things working against us ... and i do screw up from time to time , but so does everybody else .
the difference with me is i am actively ...
i' m trying so hard to get it right .
and i wanna be the man that you see in me every so often .
okay , on leap years , fine .
but i wanna be that guy for you .
bottom line is ...
i love you so much .
i' il figure it out , okay ?
i' il get it .
you just gotta give me a chance .
are you sure about this ?
yeah , i' m sure .
why now ?
' cause you want this more than anything in the world .
and i wanna give it to you .
i wanna make a baby with you .
i can' t .
why ?
because i love you and i can' t do this to you .
i don' t understand .
what are you doing to me ?
it actually feels really good .
i just can' t .
i wanna give this to you .
i know you do .
and it' s the sweetest gift anyone' s ever given me .
but it' s not right for you .
you' il regret it .
you know this .
the fact that you' re still willing ... just shows how deep your love goes .
that' s the gift i' m taking from you .
i think i only need to sell one more painting ... then i' il have enough to get out of here .
what ?
where you gonna go ?
i was thinking about somewhere in central america .
maybe el salvador .
you' re just gonna pick up and go to el salvador ?
yeah .
i don' t understand .
you get there , you get off the plane .
how do you know where to go ?
i don' t .
i' m going to figure it out .
it' s time for me to try something like this .
i' ve never even left the country before .
excuse me .
what about class trip ' 98 ?
what , niagara falls ?
yeah .
come on , morris .
what ?
well , man , what am i gonna do ?
you should come with me .
no .

yeah .
that' s noriega country , amigo .
i' m gonna pass on that .
no , that' s panama , and you might learn something .
i' m learning right here .
i went on a second date with this girl the other night .
you' re kidding me .
yes , i am .
but i had you for a second , didn' t i ?
i had you .
oh , shit .

i forgot my hat at the restaurant .
oh , you schmuck .
