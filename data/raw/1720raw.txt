the battle between heaven and hell has waged eternal , their armies fueled by souls harvested on earth .
the devil , malebolgia , has sent a lieutenant to earth ... to recruit men to turn the world into a place of death ... in exchange for wealth and power a place that provides enough souls to complete his army ... and allow armageddon to begin .
all the dark lord needs now is a great soldier , someone who can lead his hordes to the gates of heaven ... and burn them down .
like him , i killed in the name of good , but the violence of my life ... pulled my soul towards the darkness .
but i fought and freed my soul .
now i watch for others like me .
men are the ones who create evil on earth .
it is the choices they make ... that enslave their souls to hell .
this is the test .
the leader of the algerian revolutionary front ... was killed yesterday along with 26 innocent civilians ... in a vicious rocket attack in hong kong .
there has been an outpouring of anti u. s. sentiment ... sweeping across the globe .
protesters in libya , bosnia , france , moscow ... and the united states ... are denouncing ...
simmons is the best .
simmons is not the problem !
he' s overseas killing the bad guys ...
iike the hero he thinks he is .
we made a deal , wynn .
where the hell ... is the ultimate weapon you promised ?
this isn' t a game we' re playing .
engineering a biological weapon is an exact science .
you want it done right , you do it my way .
this five year plan of yours just chaps my buttocks .
i' m making you a guarantee .
just keep certain agencies off my back ... and make damn sure i get all that i' ve been promised .
if i say you' re the man , you' re the man .
you do for me , in no time you' il be running this place .
when the big pinata breaks , you' il get it all .
just make sure you keep your end of the bargain .
p. s ...
there' s one more item on our " to do " list .
it requires your personal attention .
we need you to help recruit a very special soldier for us .
your all time favorite killer , ai simmons .
simmons ?
he' s doing a great job where he is .
why do you want him ?
why do you people always question ?
why ask " why ? " when " how ? " is so much more fun ?
oh ... not again .
wanda , do me a favor .
yeah ?
buy your man a watch .
he' s on his way out .
do me a favor .
what' s that ?
make sure he' s back for dinner tomorrow night .
i' il do my best .
make sure he' s back for dinner , terry .
yes , ma' am .
hey , spaz .
same routine , all right ?
guard the house .
guard wanda .
great guard dog .
here .
al , what happened last night ?
look at this .
what a friggin ' mess .
we were supposed to take out bad guys , not innocent bystanders .
another jason wynn special .
what do you mean ?
an awful lot of wynn' s ops have screwed the pooch lately .
don' t worry , al .
lighten up .
i got your back .
semper fi .
good to go .
all right .
i' m going to keep my eye on wynn .
vehicle secure .
the airport kill zone ... was supposed to be clear of civilians .
an unfortunate but necessary sacrifice .
you want someone filling body bags , send priest .
if you can' t handle it , i will .
i will send whoever wherever i choose .
you will follow orders and do your job .
got a problem with that , soldier ?
yes , i do , sir ... and i want out .
i always knew you' d lose your nerve .
you don' t quit us , son .
we are not the u. s. postal service .
have you read your profile recently ?
you are a borderline psychopath , perfect for government service .
no guilt , no fear .
you' re a killing machine .
you' re wrong about me , wynn .
am l ?
have you stopped to consider ... that you won' t be happy doing anything else ?
i made up my mind .
nothing i can say to change it ?
nothing .
i' il arrange for your transfer ... right after we' ve run this last operation .
north korean refinery secretly producing biological weapons .
it' s up to us to take out the plant ... and carefully destroy all the biochemical viruses .
come on , son .
this is top priority .
let' s get it over with .
what the hell is going on here ?
priorities have changed , al .
there' s a town nearby .
if you release the virus , they' il all die .
a town with approximately 8, 000 experimental hosts .
are you out of your damn mind ?
i' m not going to let you do this .
looks like i' m up for a promotion .
you wipe his ass , too ?
you son of a bitch .
you knew what was going on all along .
i do believe he' s catching on .
enjoy your retirement , old friend .
oh , and by the way , don' t worry about wanda .
i' il take good care of her .
you touch her , and you' re a dead man .
you' re the dead man .
see you in hell , al .
aw , look who was left in the oven too long .
i told him well done , not burnt .
i' m gonna have fun with you .
hey , mister , you don' t look so good .
hey , mister , you thirsty ?
get the get lost , kid .
what are you looking at , old man ?
you tell me .
you' ve been gone a long time , friend .
what are you talking about ?
where am l ?
rat city .
part of the alley .
i sleep over there .
this is a holy place .
all are welcome here .
here , zack , here .
yeah , right .
don' t loiter !
let' s go !
let' s go !
you' re welcome to join us ... if you choose .
i got a home .
a new hellspawn has emerged from the darkness .
reborn on earth ... drawn to the alley by an unknown force ... his necroplasmic body wracked by pain ... his memories fragmented .
to him , north korea was moments ago .
malebolgia kept him secluded in darkness five long years ... while things on earth changed in ways ... that will only feed his anger and desire for revenge .
he sets out to reclaim his humanity .
how much is left remains to be seen .
one ... two ... three !
i don' t have a choice .
i' il always love you ... forever .
spaz .
kids , i got more tricks than your local hooker .
here you go .
they say it' s a trick , but it' s snot .
little girl , where are you going ?
want some candy ?
cyan !
you ok , baby ?
terry !
i like children ... fried .
what' s going on ?
this man was lying next to cyan .
are you ok , honey ?
what are you doing back here , huh ?
what is it ?
beat it before i call the cops .
come on , get out of here .
there you are .
i' ve been looking everywhere for you .
bad crispy !
bad crispy !
clown not like .
sorry for the turbulence , folks .
he' s harmless .
just a freak accident with some jiffy pop .
just get out of here and take him .
oh , what an adorable little girl .
can i keep her ?
hey .
of course not .
no pets allowed .
a little something for lolita here ?
baby exorcist .
come on , my barbecued friend .
don' t want to keep ... that side order of potato salad waiting .
he knew my name .
are you sure ?
come on .
let' s get the kids inside .
you can' t get married .
wanda' s the best thing that ever happened to me .
i' m there for you , buddy .
this is my last mission .
wait for me .
i just don' t want to lose you , baby .
you will never lose me .
i promise .
the master and i are going to have words .
he knows i hate clowns .
god , i hate them .
i hate them all .
i hate bozo , ronald , chuckles ... with their freakin ' dumb noses and their lousy party hats !
i don' t mind being short , fat , and ugly , but the pay sucks !
easy with that face .
i' m eating .
what does this remind you of ?
no , naughty boy .
oops .
a wet one .
i hope i didn' t stain my underwear .
look at that .
skid marks .
get away from me , you freak .
coming from a monster , that really hurts my feelings .
come back here , scrotum face .
i' m not done with you yet .
feels like my skin is about to explode .
that' s your viral necroplasm going through its larval stage .
move over .
pretty soon you' il get hair in funny places , and you' il start thinking about girls .
getting a chubby , studly ?
a half guy , semi ?
just get me to a hospital .
a hospital ?
have you looked in a mirror , burnt man walking ?
even the entire cast of " er " couldn' t put you together again .
how do i put this to you ?
you' re pushing up daisies .
you' re in permanent nap time .
you' re fertilizer .
is any of this sinking in ?
you' re dead .
d e d .
dead .
i guess five years feeding earthworms ... has eaten what little brain there was in there .
what are you ?
allow me to kick start your memory .
hang on .
these flashbacks can be killers .
you' re the dead man .
see you in hell , al .
this is the bargain .
if you lead my army , you can see wanda again .
what is your answer ?
i will lead your army !
anything for wanda !
if you fail me , you will die .
avenge your murder .
kill jason wynn .
malebolgia spent five years preparing the earth ... for your arrival , mister .
a little death , a little destruction ... perfect marriage .
speaking of marriage ... guess who' s not your fiancee anymore .
and the winners are wanda and terry .
multiplying like rabbits .
and humpin ' and porkin ' ... and doin ' it and likin ' it .
you stay away from her .
i don' t want wanda .
i want you to take care of wynn .
then you and the army can kick some angelic buttocks .
and in return for your services , we' il get wanda back for you .
you could have every wanda on the planet .
why settle for leftovers ?
i love this guy .
you kill me .
go ahead , stud .
this is all some sadistic game of wynn' s .
and when i catch him ... he' il wish he had killed me when he had the chance .
that' s it !
that' s the spirit .
just think of me as your guardian angel .
the clown from hell .
you' re jimmy stewart , and i' m clarence .
uh , well , well , every time somebody farts ,
a demon gets his wings .
oops , twins .
get away from me , you fudge packing midget !
you still don' t get it , do you , amnesia boy ?
we' il have to dig a little deeper .
what is this ?
this is where old folks go after florida , son .
what is that you say ?
can i dig up my body now ?
why , certainly .
of course you can .
if you strike oil , half of it is mine .
start digging .
hail , satan , lord of all that we can see .
in the name of luther , bialy , and levinson ,
i command thee to appear !
told you we need a bigger pentagram .
how about we get back to that sacrifice a virgin idea ?
i like that !
you know what i need here , man ?
a fresh skull , man !
yeah , you .
get away !
fresh !
every time you go out there , you come back a little bit more dead inside .
oh , come on .
you scream like a girl .
do it like this .
someone' s a little angry ' cause they died and went to
hello , my mutant , hello , my carcass , hello , my bug infested corpse .
did , like , satan send you guys ?
god hogs up all the good followers , and we get all the retards .
what' s up with that face ?
get your hands off me !
help .
what is that ?
shocked and amazed at the wonders of necroflesh ?
you' re not alone .
for a limited time only , you , too , can have this handsome epidermis ... for the eensy price of your soul and a buttload of pain .
let' s get out of here !
oh , my god !
i hate weekend satanists , don' t you ?
look at you .
from spawn larva to full fledged hellspawn in record time .
what ... is this ?
you were tied to the tracks , and that stupid train just kept running over you , didn' t it ?
running over you .
in the name of the people and things of hell ,
i dub thee ...
spawn , general of hell' s army .
arise , your crispness !
arise , duke of deep fried !
sultan of sizzling !
emir of ooey gooey !
so i suck as a clown .
bite me .
do your job , i' il be the first to kiss your black butt , but if you can' t hack it ,
i' il fed ex your worthless carcass ... back to the frying pan , where malebolgia will be waiting for us .
you' il wake up the dead .
that' s you .
dead people can still die .
all i got to do is cut off your head .
oh , god .
did you have to use the " g " word ?
wanda ...
what have i done ?
you done with this hallmark moment ?
i can' t take any more of this sentimental crap .
come on .
i' il come back when your armor hardens .
don' t play with it .
you' il go blind .
i have a few more details to attend to , and then we can play .
yuck !
i hate anchovies .
that tastes so good , i could kick some puppies !
this freak stuff will come in handy ... when i get my hands on wynn .
you' re letting them get to you .
easy , friend .
every choice has its consequences .
who are you ?
an assassin ... like you .
i killed for the kingdom of saxony 500 years ago .
i am cogliostro .
that' s all you need to know ... for now .
are there any normal people left on earth ?
or is everyone just back from hell ?
how do you address the accusations from some ... that the cla only acts to protect ... the government' s economic interests ... in the regions of conflict ?
i think the government has been attentive ... to the sensitivities of the nations involved .
since the unfortunate incident in southeast asia last week ,
director wynn has been meeting with several world leaders ... in an attempt to quell the proliferation ... of global conflicts .
has this produced results ?
last week' s peace summit between arabs and lsraelis ... was disrupted by bomb threats from the christian coalition .
fitzgerald may be a spineless bureaucrat , but he' s doing a great p. r. job for me .
the world is going to hell in a handbasket .
thanks to him , it' s just another story on the 5 : 00 news .
like lambs to the slaughter .
the best is yet to come .
there it is , jess .
finally ready .
heat 16 .
makes the ebola virus look like a skin rash .
that north korean biochemical operation really paid off .
we harvested the ultimate weapon from those diseased bodies , and now we have the only vaccine .
was there ever any doubt ?
never .
we have weapons in place to disperse heat 16 ... over half of this godforsaken globe .
soon the whole world will be at my command .
anyone who refuses to join my consortium ... won' t be around to argue .
time to get reacquainted , jason .
director wynn , terry fitzgerald is here .
send him in .
speak of the devil .
come in .
good to see you .
director , the car is waiting downstairs .
good .
you know agent priest .
yes .
could i have a word with you ... alone ?
of course .
would you excuse us ?
glad you dropped by , son .
i want to commend you on your handling of the media .
those rumors about me were becoming a real headache .
let' s have a drink .
thank you .
i know we' ve been covering up problems ... with our missions overseas .
i really can' t keep lying like this , sir .
lying ?
really ?
i' d like to put a team together , analyze the field op data , get to the bottom of it .
but you' re not an analyst anymore .
there' s no reason not to take a look , sir .
on the contrary .
beg your pardon ?
tell me ... how are cyan and wanda ?
little girl just had a birthday , didn' t she ?
they' re both fine .
i' m glad to hear that .
now , let' s get something straight .
i run this organization the way i see fit , and i will do whatever is necessary to keep it that way .
your job is to make damn sure the public agrees with me .
that clear enough ?
good .
the car is waiting .
achmed and abdullah .
achmed , my friend .
good to see you .
abdullah , good to see you .
up .
this one here .
excuse us .
excuse me , sir .
urgent call .
gentlemen ...
have you made a decision ?
your heat 16 test was very impressive .
how do you control delivery of the weapon ?
it' s the latest in nanotechnology .
let me assure you , the weapon is problem free .
we' ve already placed orders with several of our allies .
you' re becoming quite a powerful man .
your consortium will soon rival the united nations .
not at all , sir .
i' m just a facilitator .
thank you .
my partners are the beneficiaries .
to my partners , gentlemen .
code red security breach , sir .
where ?
at the armory .
a detail' s en route .
i' m on my way .
damn it .
agent priest has arrived .
wait here .
there' s been a break in at a 6 , the armory .
who ?
we don' t know .
there' s a security detail downstairs with priest .
let' s get out of here .
you !
who are you ?
what' s the matter , jason ?
you don' t recognize your own handiwork ?
you left me to die in that biochem plant , remember ?
simmons !
you sent me to hell !
i' m here to return the favor !
i trusted you .
jesus .
how could you marry wanda ?
how could you ?
al , when you died ...
wanda was devastated .
do you know about cyan ?
time to die , jason .
nice outfit , asshole .
damn .
what the hell is that ?
it' s simmons !
what are you talking about ?
that thing is simmons !
i want you to nail him now !
it' s a little early for halloween .
where you' re going , every day' s halloween .
you don' t have the guts .
you' re right .
coming , coming .
will that be the same or separate checks , lady ?
just when i was getting sick of you whining about wanda , you do us proud .
so congrats on your first mission .
go ahead .
run !
holy shit !
shoot on sight .
i say again shoot on sight .
get a light on him !
there !
you see him ?
no , sir !
where the hell did he go ?
negative , sir !
there he is !
all right !
take him !
what have we got here ?
gunshot wound to the head , doc .
oh , she' s dead .
come on .
easy .
make some room here .
put her around the back .
why didn' t you warn me about simmons ?
spawn was ready sooner than i expected , so don' t get your panties in a wad .
always bitching at me
why didn' t you tell me about simmons ?
why didn' t you tell me it was going to hurt ?
am i going to go to hell ?
oh , grow up , you syphilitic ball sac .
at least you had fun compared to them .
fun ?
does this look like playland to you ?
he killed priest !
he damn near killed me !
you say that like it' s a bad thing .
no , jerky .
jerky , spawn' s a big idiot .
look , he' s been through hell .
as soon as he finishes one more little detail , he' il be ready to join us .
i' ve done my part .
how about yours ?
how we doing on your front ?
heat 16 is ready to go .
it better be .
the army' s ready .
the spawn' s ready .
the heat 16 completes the picture .
congrat a freak a lations .
what' s simmons got to do with all this ?
he' s just the highest scoring killer of all time .
if we hadn' t recruited him , the other side would have .
i almost forgot again .
memo from brimstone breath we' re going to rig a fancy schmancy device ... that connects your heartbeat to the heat 16 bomb , so if your heart stops ticking , the bomb goes off .
we don' t want any smart ass fruitcake ... taking you out ahead of schedule .
an insurance policy from hell , the good hands people .
that' s a good idea .
i like that .
i want your special attention dealing with spawn , you hear me ?
gladly .
good .
now , stay sharp .
the night is young .
ladies ?
ooh , clownie .
ah , yes .
have you ever ridden a clown' s pink pony ?
i think it' s about time .
when all the world is mine ,
i will personally fry your lard ass .
as you' ve seen , the terrible north korean biochemical disaster ... unleashed a whole host of new diseases .
ten thousand people died in the first month ... after the disaster five years ago .
millions have contracted these fatal diseases diphtheria , cholera , smallpox diseases that had been virtually wiped out .
thought i was getting rid of the world' s vermin , and i turn out to be one of them .
the number of sick and dying children continues to grow .
it' s up to us to put an end ... to the suffering of these innocent children .
spaz !
what happened to you ?
i was playing with spaz , and i fell down .
are you all right ?
yeah , i' m ok .
wow .
your face is weird .
cool .
what' s your name ?
spawn .
i' m cyan .
you have your mother' s eyes .
i knew her a long time ago .
let' s get you back to your mother .
my , my , my .
what a pretty little dress .
i wonder if she' s got it in my size ?
spawnie , spawnie , he' s our man .
if he can' t kill ' em , no one can .
yay , spawnie !
s " to the " p " to the " a " to the " awn .
go , spawnie , go , spawnie !
you fool !
i put you on earth ... to make sure spawn keeps his end of the bargain .
why' d you pick him to lead the army anyway ?
what are you thinking ?
it should be me .
i had the tenure .
it' s not fair !
it' s not fair !
and that' s exactly the kind of talk ... we don' t tolerate around here , right , boss ?
enough !
spawn must choose ... to murder wynn and release the virus .
then my army will be complete .
now , now , boss ...
this is your last chance .
thank you .
excuse me .
cyan !
honey , didn' t i tell you not to leave my sight ?
i was playing with spaz , and i fell down , and spawn came and helped me .
you' re not supposed to talk to strangers , either .
spawn' s not a stranger , mommy .
we' re going home right now .
what' s going on ?
what is going on ?
i' il explain later .
no , explain now .
i' m not going through this again .
no secrets .
wynn was attacked at the reception .
i don' t want to take any chances .
trust me .
go home .
fix your seat belt , honey .
what the hell is going on ?
daddy , what about spaz ?
spaz ?
go home , spaz .
he knows the way back home better than we do .
let' s go , terry .
you don' t want to be where i' m going .
but it' s your funeral .
hey , what the hell are you doing ?
puking up decent food , boy ?
it' s rotten .
you think we eat so good you can just spit up what you like ?
don' t talk back to me .
eat this !
no , don' t !
he' s my dad .
keep away from him .
b. p. and heart rate ?
one thirty four over 77 , heart rate , 60 .
let' s increase the flow to 3 . 5 .
we' re ready for the monitor .
i' il make a small incision ... so that we can insert this heart monitor .
you' il feel a slight pinch .
awesome hardware .
what will you do with it ?
throw someone a going away party .
need any help ?
listen , kid ...
i' m not looking to make friends .
what' s your name ?
zack .
i' m al .
that' s spaz .
breathe normally , director .
the system is now operational .
as per your orders , director wynn , if your vital signs flatline for any reason , the device will uplink and detonate the heat 16 bombs .
no one would dare kill you .
good work , doc .
what a double cross .
i got wynn to kill spawn and create the heat 16 bomb .
now i get spawn to murder wynn and release the virus .
if all goes well , it should hurt like hell .
i can' t believe i actually got wynn to get operated .
what a maroon .
it' s going to send earth into a tailspin ... of death and destruction .
it' s time .
sometimes i wake up at night down in the alley and wonder ...
is this hell ?
not yet ... but soon .
heads up .
got one .
who' s your new friend , spawn ?
get out of here , zack .
but
go !
miss me ?
here' s clownie !
it was you who told wynn to kill me .
guilty as charged .
before i blow your fat circus ass away , tell me why you picked me to lead your war .
if it isn' t curious crispy .
the evil' s been there ... since you were soup in your mama' s crotch .
your dna spelled doa , and we just nursed it along .
those assassin missions were just training for what' s coming .
let' s get down to business .
wynn' s finally got that heat 16 virus bomb working .
made especially for you .
get things started with a big , wet , infectious ...
all you have to do is just lead us to the holy land , so we can burn it down .
you filthy little piece of vermin .
what makes you think i would join your army ?
you can take your army and shove it .
sounds like a country song " take your army and shove it .
you' ve got that " i want to beat the fat little man " ...
iook in your eye .
i' m going to cut you into 50 pieces ... and mail you to every state .
i' il take your intestines and
i don' t know how you put up with this crap .
you' re a bigger fool than i thought ... if you think you' re going to wreck my plans .
you' il do what you promised .
put down my dog .
nice doggie .
heel , fetch ...
no , i got it .
play dead !
you want to do it the hard way ?
i warned you .
i' il just have to teach you a lesson .
no more clowning around .
i' m not the vindicator ... or the victimizer ... or the vaporizer or the vibrator .
i' m ... the violator !
good lord !
i ain' t staying !
damn alley ain' t safe no more !
we' re going .
violator , one , spawnie boy , zero .
you' ve been violated , girlie man , huh ?
i could have killed you like that .
is that a little more surprise than you wanted ?
twinkle , twinkle , little spawn .
you look like crap .
go fertilize my lawn .
you' re not excited yet ?
helter skelter' s coming down with or without you .
either you lead the army , or wynn plays pin the tail on wanda .
hey , wanda , come on , give me that sweet stuff .
oh , no .
oh , please , wynn , don' t .
somebody help me .
forget terry .
it' s my turn to ride the wanda carousel of love .
stay away from her .
your choice .
see you at wanda' s .
last one there gets her rotten eggs .
wynn and wanda sitting in a tree , s u c k i n g .
first comes love ...
the truth has taken its toll on you .
i' m going to kill that asshole .
you still haven' t learned .
clearance granted .
downloading secure files .
gotcha , jason .
i can' t afford to be wrong .
still with us , i see .
your vengeance ... their pain .
wynn , wanda none of this is worth the cost .
those are the only things that matter to me now .
ai simmons is dead .
let him go .
i am simmons , old man .
you' re spawn now , but that doesn' t mean you have to be what they want .
you' re still letting them get to you .
your anger is your weakness .
they' il use it to rob you of any humanity you have left .
ai simmons knew that violence ... only makes for more pain and suffering .
he tried to leave off killing , give himself a second chance .
your old life is gone .
accept that .
i still love wanda .
put her in the past .
it' s the only way you can be free .
she' s the only reason i' m here .
the war between heaven and hell ... depends on the choices we make , and those choices require sacrifice .
that' s the test .
i didn' t know this was going to happen .
i' m going to nail that scumbag .
kiss it good bye , clown .
this is just what they want .
you' re playing their game .
then i' il play dirty .
guns are useless .
you got a better idea ?
i might .
you' ve been using your armor only by reflex .
you must learn to control it .
it has trillions of neuroconnections .
they' re a living extension of your own instincts , instantly translating your thought ... into physical reality , so long as you stay clear and focused .
so ... that' s how it works .
cool !
now try your chains .
you must visualize your objective .
the armor does the rest .
all right , yoda .
wait .
you ready ?
all right , go !
not bad .
don' t get cocky .
you' ve a lot more to learn .
your cape has its own powers .
i have to get to wanda' s .
take care of your powers .
when you drain them , you die .
won' t be needing these .
you' re catching on .
or this .
i want you to return spaz to me .
no matter how you find him .

when i' m done with you , they' il change your name to " stain .
look , ma , no hands !
i love the smell ... of burning asphalt in the morning !
send a boy to do a clown' s job ?
it' s an honor to be a hellspawn , you hear me ?
that' s not fair !
time for some necro goo !
open wide and say " aah !
see you at wanda' s !
reading secure files .

wynn is out of his mind .
i' m thirsty .

establishing connection .
what have you got ?
black bag ops , assassination lists , everything .
wynn' s been using a 6 to run a criminal consortium .
he' s got some biological weapon called heat 16 .
it' s all there ?
i want to get it on tonight' s news .
i' m e mailing you a copy .
it should be enough to bury wynn .
great .
daddy ?
hey , sweetheart .
what are you doing here ?
some unfinished business .
you disappoint me , terry .
you can' t release the virus .
millions of people will die .
only those who refuse to join me .
you' re a very lucky man .
whatever it is you want , just take it and go .
i intend to .
let' s go .
on the floor .
the kid stays with me .
answer the door .
go on .
it' s all right , sweetheart .
peek a boo .
i see you .
this place is hard to find in the dark .
i smell you' re not wearing any panties .
hello , cyan .
remember me ?
you were at my birthday party .
no duh .
what are you , a regular einstein ?
you sure know how to raise them .
don' t you touch her .
back off , hero .
i' m back by popular demand .
big as life and twice as rotten .
does wonders for my asthma .
where' s spawn ?
let' s cut the crap .
spawn' s on his way .
you ready to play ?
of course i am .
you better be .
you don' t know how much your heart means to me .
bring ' em , jerky .
come on .
help me , please .
careful .
don' t make me nervous .
i might nick something vital .
get away from her .
i can' t do that .
she wants me .
you touch her , and you die slow .
all right , spawn .
no more fun and games .
either you join hell' s army , or she dies ... after i' m done .
i will rip your heart out !
let her go .
so what' s it gonna be ?
time' s running out .
too late .
it' s all your fault , spawn .
she was doing fine till you showed up .
now you' ve got nothing left to lose .
you' re a soulless corpse !
nothing !
you' re wrong .
i' ve still got you .
don' t be afraid .
you can' t kill me .
is that right ?
if my heart stops , the virus is released , and everybody in the world dies .
like you said ...
i' ve got nothing else to lose .
that' s right .
feel the burn .
get used to it .
it' s payback time .
see you in hell , jason .
if you kill me , you kill her !
i' m through doing hell' s dirty work .
you worthless bag of ...
how could you let him kill me ?
the most important thing in your entire freakin ' universe !
whatever happened to love , honor , respect ?
you pansy bacon crisp !
you should have killed him !
popped his head like a zit .
it feels ... so good .
and feel that butt .
it feels so ... hairy .
joke' s over .
you should have killed jason when you had the chance .
never .
what do you mean never ?
never ?
do you know how hard i' ve been working on this ?
you set me up , you malignant sow !
what do you think you got the pacemaker for ?
your perfect attendance record , you spoon sucking dipstick ?
i was counting on spawn killing you .
then you would get his soul ... and kick start the apocalypse now .
i say destroy the cosmos , ask questions later .
but first ... first , i want to slaughter each and every one of you .
and then i' m gonna have a little creme de wanda .
i' il let you watch , too .
yummy yum .
tastes like chicken .
cogliostro !
come and get me !
he' il be back .
concentrate on healing .
come on !
i may not be able to hold him off alone .
come on down to my world and die , suckers !
all right , you overgrown gecko ...
come and get your throat cut .
if you won' t lead my army , then you must die .
never !
bring me spawn' s head .
you will never escape me .
it' s all right now , baby .
come on .
they belong together .
there' s no place for me here .
maybe you' re the one after all .
you were checking me out from the start , weren' t you ?
i' m too old for this .
not as quick as i used to be .
i' ve fought this war long enough .
it' s time for someone to take over .
what if i sided with clown ?
i' d have killed you .
right .
i followed him here .
thanks , kid .
use your armor !
concentrate !
bite this !
cut off his head !
you' il pay for this .
it' s not over yet .
i' il gum you to death .
i' il bite you .
wanda , what do you think about a little head ?
this is your last chance to join up .
think about it .
come on .
you' il pay for this .
give my regards to your boss .
tell him he' s next .
i' m gonna die !
not bad for a dead man .
beginner' s luck .
come on , folks .
let' s move back , please .
is it true the documents you' ve uncovered ... implicate jason wynn ?
yes .
for the past five years , i unwittingly participated ... in jason wynn' s illegal manipulation of the a 6 ... to further his ambitions for worldwide power .
what took you so long to respond ?
are the heat 16 bombs still a danger ?
the entire heat 16 weapon system has already been destroyed .
do you have any further comments ?
something i should have done a long time ago .
the documents i release to all media outlets ... will answer the rest of your questions .
thank you .

the choice has been made .
for now .
