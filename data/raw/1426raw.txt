once in a great while , mankind unlocks a secret so profound ... that our future is altered forever .
fire .
electricity .
splitting the atom .
at the dawn of the 31st century , we unlocked another .
it had the potential to change humanity' s role in the universe .
we called it the titan project , and it was a testament ... to the limitless power of the human imagination .
perhaps that is what the drej feared most , for ... it brought them down upon us without warning ... and ... without mercy .
cale , that day , the day the drej descended from the sky , the only thing that mattered was keeping you safe .
perfect !
hey , stop !

mm .
is that too much for a fellow to ask ?
do you hear a crackling sound ?
and what was up with chowquin ?
you should' ve seen him .
ha ha , not much chance of that .
he was so out of control , treatin ' me like i' m some kind of  human ?
don' t start with that solidarity thing again .
if you would study human history as you' ve been instructed , you might realize you' re not alone out there , and you' d be better prepared for the future .
well , i' il tell you somethin ' about your famous future .
mmm .
every day i wake up , it' s still the present , the same grimy , boring present .
i don' t think this future thing exists .
do you hear a crackling sound ?
here we go .
we gotta get outta this dump .
hold on , everybody !
i got it !
please don' t panic .
just think of it as floating time .
two seconds .
everybody calm .
ah .
just needed some love .
let' s get back to eatin ' baby .
okay .
well , i' m full .
ohh .
hey , cale .
firrikash .
po , how' s it floatin ' ?
you pulled a nasty stunt back there .
we don' t like your attitude .
you' ve been a little uppity .
up up is that so ?
well .
i' m gonna have to work on that .
we travel in packs .
what are you doing ?
it' s commonly known as helping .
yeah ?
well , what for ?
sometimes , kid , people just help each other out .
oh , right .
so you' re gonna tell me you don' t want something in return ?
all right .
maybe i do .
what a shock .
i want you to risk your life .
i want you to give up everything you have to join the mission , where you' il face terror and torture and possibly gruesome death .
and i would wanna do that because ... ?
because ... it' s worth it .
because ... the human race needs you .
maybe you haven' t had a look around lately , but there aren' t many of us left .
at the rate we' re going , they' il be reading about us in textbooks ...
and displaying our bones in alien museums .
yeah , well , having your planet blown up can have that effect on a species .
but maybe i' ve been wrong all these years , and it took your inspiring speech to make me see it .
you' ve really changed me .
it' s beautiful .
i think we' ve gotta hug .
oh , man .
they' ve really ground you down .
hey , get this straight .
i don' t even know you .
i don' t want any part of your mission ,
and i don' t need your help with these oversized morons .
oh , okay .
i think he called you morons .
whoa !
korso .
captain , this is akima .
we are not alone .
are we in good company ?
that' s a negative , captain .
i think we' ve fallen in with a very bad crowd .
roger that .
let' s prep for departure .
tek , i need to be scarce for a while .
you don' t know the half of it .
ha ha .
are you still bothering people ?
hey , go away .
great job with the kid , tek .
he' s a charmer .
i expected you to take him off my hands a lot sooner .
tek , hey , wait .
who is this ?
you know him ?
joseph korso .
i was with your father on the titan project .
my father .
i don' t have a father .
you brought this guy here ?
yes .
i don' t understand .
why ?
you still got that ring your father gave you ?
give it to me .
hey , give it back !
cale  shh .
ahh .
ah .
here .
put it on .
hmm .
how did how did you  it' s a storage device .
it' s genetically encrypted to your father , and therefore , to you .
it' s a map , cale .
it can tell us where your father hid the titan .
that' s why i' ve spent the last 15 years lookin ' for ya .
that ship means everything .
humanity depends on you finding it .
me ?
whoa , whoa , whoa .
me ?
no , no , no .
i' m not tek , listen , there must be someone better .
it' s time , cale .
it' s time to stop running .
well , actually ,
i think it' s time to start .
drej .
what do they want ?
they want you , kid .
same way i want you , only dead .
how do you know they want me dead ?
i' m convinced .
we gotta get to the kitchen .
korso , the gravity drive !
you ready ?
tek , i' il lead you in .
i' il stay here .
tek , you can' t .
take care of the kid .
he' s not all grown up yet .
no , no , no , no .
you' re coming .

i' il read about you .
follow me !
whoa !
well , this would be good if we had any baking to do .
oh , my food !
you guys are you' re terrible .
you' re unsanitary .
ooh , i hope that they catch you , and i' il testify against you , and you' il never get out of jail .
hey , you' il get all the ketchup you want .
drej !
ooh , i gotta go now .

oh , great .
yeah , no one would ever think of looking for us in the vent .
go !

whoa !
ow !
hang on , kid .
i' m comin ' .
heads up !
they' re locking down the doors !
not going forward .

you should brace yourself .
uh , yeah .
i' m feeling that .
eject .
hey , where' s the eject ?
cale ?
cale ?
this model does have eject , right ?
and you were worried .
what do you mean , " were " ?
akima , we need a pickup here .
a little late for that .
i' m right above you .

not enough time .
not not not a lot of time .
exhale .
you gotta be kidding .
exhale .
oh , no , no , no , no !
# comeback down to earth , oh , yeah #
# comeback down to earth comeback down to earth #
# oh , yeah comeback down to earth #
is it dead ?
can we eat it ?
no , it' s not dead .
who are you ?
go away .
hey , what' s going on ?
preed , you' re in my light .
ah , such motherly concern for the subject .
why am i naked ?
why , you positively glow with maternal warmth , akima .
it' s very fetching .
i must have you .
in your dreams .
akrennians don' t dream , remember ?
they don' t bathe much , either .
i' m still naked here .
i hadn' t noticed .
now , hold still , or you' il lose something really important .
hand me the probe .
the probe ?
uh , wh where does the probe go ?
you know , i' m really feeling much better .
aah !
hey !
this is just great .
cross half the galaxy , nearly get our butts shot off by the drej , just so we can rescue the window washer .
hey , for your information , i happen to be humanity' s last great hope .
i weep for the species .
you' re fine .
i mean , i' m the guy with the map here .
this is big medicine , right ?
big medicine ?
let me see .
this is really it ?
this can save us ?
huh ?
yeah , i guess .
do you know what this means ?
um , i' m really wanting those pants right about now .
akima , my pet , if the boy isn' t at death' s door ,
korso wants gune to check the map so we can set a course .
do you mind ?
are we through pawing ?
this is the valkyrie , not a singles bar .
we' re done .
you know , i never said i was gonna help you guys .
we never even addressed what' s in it for me .
why , you get to be a hero .
a hero ?
come on .
i mean , there must be something on the titan worth selling or trading or
what ?
we' re gonna risk our necks to help a bunch of drifter colony bums ?
where are my pants ?
guess where akima grew up .
drifter colony ?
yes .
the boy learns .
wait .
what' s your
preed , wait up !
look .
where' s korso ?
i wanna talk to him .
i believe he' s in navigation .
we' re headed there now .
you wanna watch who you' re steppin ' on .
or you' il what ?
ah , the lovely and talented stith .
this is cale .
you remember cale .
no , no , no , no , no .
cannot talk .
we lost targeting on one of our aft gun turrets again !
what ?
think this is a pleasure cruise ?
she' s a sweet little thing .
weapons specialist .
normally , she' s very good natured .
great !
things aren' t bad enough !
tools all over the floor !
fight the good fight , precious .
preed , i' il kill you .
okay ?
i will kill you .
i am educated and well read !
i am not a mechanic !
i have my pride !
gune ?
guney ?
are you in there ? ... by the acceleration , multiplied by the coefficient of the friction ... and apply necessary force .
gune ?
ooh .
look at that .
does this look familiar ?
do you know what it is ?
neither do i. i made it last night in my sleep .
apparently , i used gindrogac highly unstable .
gune .
i put a button on it , yes .
i wish to press it , but i' m not sure what will happen if i do .
let me see , now .
three , five , twenty two , seventy four ,
eleven
no .
no no no no .
careful .
it' s perfect .
ho , yes !
hey .
perfect !
you fixed it !
so , where are we now ?
we are here , right here bellasan quadrant .
about three million keks from tau 14 .
why ?
are you homesick ?
gotta have a home for that .
mmm .
translucent bipedal mesomorphic embryonic male .
yes , yes , yes .
this is all very fascinating , but take a look at this .
it' s a map .
can you read it ?
can i read it ?
of course i can read it .
yes .
hmm .
so , what do you see ?
ah !
yes , this is pl' ochda .
and this this this is ...
solbrecht !
and this and this and this what is this ?
that' s , uh that' s lunch .
what' s lunch ?
mmm .
spaghetti derivative , meatballs sort of , anyway and caldoch droppings .
who ate it before you did ?
hey , hey !
ahh !
tell you a secret .
this guy' s nuts .
i' il tell you another .
he' s never wrong .
where are we going , gune ?
ahh , the broken moon of sesharrim .
only 13, 000 keks away .
have akima lay in a course .
we' re on our way .
what' s on sesharrim , anyway ?
the gauol , an ancient race .
great .
this isn' t a joyride , kid .
when the drej destroyed earth , they figured life adrift in space ... would break us down , wipe us out .
do you really want those vile creatures to be right ?
just lay down and die ?
a little late .
about 15 years too late to save the humans .
but it' s not like we didn' t have a good run .
it' s not about a good run .
it' s about our survival .
see , the titan was truly visionary , the most advanced ship in the universe .
that ship has the power to reunite the human race , to give us a home .
and the only way to find it is in your hand .
so , you' re really counting on me , then ?
we all are .
well , if i don' t like the way things are going ,
i' il show you how much like my father i really am .
i' il leave .
ahh , no place to set down on the island .
land on that coral reef .
we' il take the sled , see if we can locate the gauol .
preed , you and gune watch the ship .
watch the ship ?
and keep the engines hot .
oh , yes .
they' il be nice and toasty .
hmm .
i' m not keen on the drej catching me with my trousers down .
welcome to planet sesharrim , cale .
it stinks .
hydrogen trees .
clip one of those , and we' il be blown to steaming bits .
hello ?
anybody here ?
we' re looking for the gauol .
now , what exactly do the gauol look like ?
don' t know .
they don' t get out much .
we have a kid with a map here that you guys should know about .
i think we know what happened to the gauol .
open fire on five .
we' il clear a path to the sled .
everybody ready ?
one , two
wait .
no , no .
stop .
i think they are the gauol .
ahh .
over here !
quick little devil .
okay , all i have to do is tap into the central computer , and we can figure the departure protocols .
yes .
making progress .
yes , i' m making progress .
huh ?
wait , wait .
hmm .
ooh .
hmm .
the moon , the moon , the moon .
right , yeah .
that' s how we knew to come here .
my father made a map with that moon on it .
now , why ?
is the ship hidden there ?
ohh .
oh .
hmm .
ahh .
it must be somewhere in the andali nebula .
we did it , kid .
the titan is as good as ours .
he must have been here , standing here .
right here .
who ?
my father .
go !
let' s move it !
we' ve gotta get to the beach !
akima !
why aren' t they shooting at cale ?
they want him alive .
come on , guys .
pick it up .
pick it up .
nice catch .
pull up !
pull up !
preed , come in !
preed , where are you ?
hold on !
preed , come in !
preed !
preed , preed , preed !
aren' t you supposed to be watching for the drej ?
yes , caveman , that' s right .
drej bad .
we good .
now , go look at something shiny for a while .
how' s this ?
well , you' d better look again !
drej !
aah !
captain , we' re on our way .
where are you ?
we' re in the hydrogen trees being chased by the drej .
see if you can spot them , quick !
look there !
akima !
hang on !
nice move .
get down !
come on .
show yourselves .
get down !
cale !
i got ' em .
whoa !
preed , look !
there they are !
oh , no .
hang on , akima !
don' t shoot !
don' t shoot !
they' ve got cale !
gune , calculate their trajectory .
stith , take weapons .
let' s get on it , people .
oh , nice job covering our butts , preed .
you' re the weapons expert .
what were you doing ?
taking a nap ?
enough !
okay , the drej took cale .
but they are not gonna get away with it .
well , let' s quit running our collective mouths and go get him .
our only chance to locate them is to track akima .
stith , get on it .
hmm .
they' re gonna use you to figure out where the titan is .
probably just blow it up , too , when they find it .
yeah , well , who' s to say it would' ve worked , anyway ?
who' s to say it won' t ?
maybe korso will get to the titan first .
why do you care so much about that thing ?
i was raised around people .
drifter colony bums " , i believe , is the term .
i barely remember earth , but the older ones used to tell us about it ... so it would never be completely lost .
no matter how hard things got and they were hard those memories kept us going .
once , we had a home .
the titan is our chance to find one again .
i guess that' s how i ended up here .
what are they afraid of ?
so what did the human race ever do to the drej ?
it' s not what we did .
they' re afraid of what we might become .
hmm .
yeah , well , looks like we' re becoming extinct .
cale , you okay ?
akima !
cale !
cale !
no !
stop !
leave her alone !
akima !
no !
akima' s signal is getting stronger .
i think it' s coming from the slave cages .
a drej pod .
what' s in it ?
a human .
she' s mine .
i saw her first .
pretty .
ah .
all right .
i' il take out the guard .
easy , big girl .
this requires cunning and deception .
hello .
ah .
uh , i' m an akrennian trader .
i wonder if we might sneak a peek at the new shipment before they go on the market ?
you' re not allowed .
traditionally , no .
you' re absolutely right .
but you see , i need a new slave rather badly .
stop fidgeting , worm !
and i can' t wait till auction .
i have to be on the shuttle .
i have an appointment to have my ear shaved .
it has to be booked months in advance .
you see my problem .
hmm .
you' re lying .
he' s not a slave , and you' re not traders .
but  he doesn' t carry himself like a slave .
look at the way he stands .
probably ex military .
how
akrennian traders always threaten before they ask a favor .
it' s tradition .
and your robes are made out of bedspreads .
ah .
just out of curiosity , did we have a plan " b " ?
hmm .
an intelligent guard .
didn' t see that one coming .
whoa .
this is it .
are you in there ?
well , if it isn' t the captain .
what kept you ?
do you see anything ?
it was really small , like a cocoon or something .
no , no , no .
nothing like that .
no .
mmm .
i do see something .
oh , no .
just a drej ship .
drej !
what ?
where ?
i' m on it .
i' m on it .
i' m on it .
korso , we have a problem .
you' d better get up here .
i' m here .
i' m here .
what' s the problem ?
stith , let' s go .
all right .
all right .
i' ve locked on to him , sir .
gune , look out for his buddy .
there' s only one .
he' s all alone .
just one .
three , five , twenty two
three , five , twenty two , seventy four , eleven .
cale !
die , drej scumball !
oh , don' t no , don' t shoot .
oh , guys
come on .
it' s me !
it' s cale !
cale !
stith , hold your fire !
oops .
akima , open the cargo bay .
cale !
ah !
the boy is not dead .
this is cause for happiness .
hmm .
so , um how did you escape ?
he got lucky .
you know , we were just about to rescue you .
yeah ?
well , thanks .
anytime .
look , uh , they copied the map .
i' m sure they' re heading for the titan now .
they won' t find it .
stations , people .
yes .
going , going .
akima ?
uh , um , what happened ?
how' d you get back ?
i got picked up with the trash .
luckily , korso got there ... before i ended up as a door prize in some alien freak show .
i guess i owe him one .
you know , we both got real lucky back there .
but the next time around  cale .
come on .
gune needs a hand .
yes , the map is good .
the map is different .
yes , the map is clear .
yes , it' s very , very clear .
ooh .
take it easy .
hmm .
this outer marking is pulsing .
ah , the distal phalangial meridian .
gune , what do you make of it ?
past outer quadrant .
this is the ice rings of tigrin .
right here .
hmm .
easy to get lost in there .
good hiding place .
what ?
wakeangels .
they follow ships into deep space , glide on the energywake .
they' re supposed to be good luck .
they' re like ... ghosts .
sit down .
why don' t you give ' em a run ?
you sure about that ?
' course i' m sure .
okay .
# it' s my time to fly #
# i' m proving ground tonight #
# i' il try to be the best that i can #
yeah .
you got it .
open her up .
give these angels something to chase .
all right .
try this , guys .
# it' s my time to fly #
# my father will be with me tonight #
# ooh #
# we' re right on target #
# it' s my time to fly #
# my father will be with us tonight #
# a chance tonight #
# to victory #
# dreams become reality # # reality #
# it' s my time to fly #
# my father will be with me tonight #
# ooh , i' m right on target #
# it' s my time to fly #
# my father will be with us tonight #
# it' s my time to fly #
# my father will be with me tonight #
# ooh , we' re right on target #
# it' s my time to fly #
# my father will be with me tonight #
# ooh #
# i' m right on target #
thank you .
i knew you could handle this old bird .
no , i mean i mean , thank you for
thank you for trying to find me .
it' s more than my father ever did .
your father was a great man , cale .
he would' ve been proud of ya .
you really think so ?
trust me .
thanks .
thanks .
you know , i i miss him .
me too .
akima ?
akima ?
huh ?
oh , uh , uh , uh , sorry .
in or out ?
huh ?
oh , uh , in .
uh , what' s going on ?
do you know why we stopped ?
pit stop for the basics .
drifter colony' s the best place ... to pick up plasmapacks , fuelcells , frozen burritos .
listen .
i need to talk to you , and
where' d you get all this junk ?
not junk .
why don' t you come with me ?
i' il show you .
so , we' re gonna barter this stuff for more of that earthjunk ?
don' t you get it , cale ?
that junk is all that' s left of the place we came from .
it reminds us of all the things we miss .
mm , miss .
like those frozen burritos you were talking about .
at least they don' t jump off your plate .
you think this is some game ?
did you forget the plan ?
i get you the titan ; i get rich .
we had a deal , right ?
how dare you try to cut me out like that ?
yeah ?
do as you please , and guess what .
you' il retrieve nothing .
you don' t have the whole map .
the kid' s got it .
and i' ve got the kid .
so you keep your drones off my back , or so help me , i' il rip his heart out .
cale , come on .
going somewhere ?
look what i' ve found : two little birdies itchy to fly .
how long were they standing there ?
long enough .
you lied ?
everything you said ?
everything you told me ?
not everything .
your father hid his ship , then the drej killed him , all because he couldn' t face the truth .
yeah ?
what is the truth ?
that the human race is out of gas .
it' s circlin ' the drain .
it' s finished .
the only thing that matters is grabbin ' what you can ... before somebody else beats you to it .
no , i don' t believe that !
then you' re even more like your father than i thought .
a fool .
cale !
akima , come on !
stop them .
stay on ' em .
i' il lock it down .
hurry !

akima !
akima ?
let' s go .
we got a ship to find .
let' s get airborne , now .
where' s cale and akima ?
they' re not coming .
why not ?
because they' re afraid .
afraid ?
what exactly are they afraid of ?
they' re afraid of what might happen if my command was ever questioned .
get it ?
got it .
you got a problem with that ?
no .
why they not say good bye to gune ?
go get a blanket , quickly .
she needs warmth .
something to keep her warm .
you , go get a doctor .
yeah .
hurry .

yes , yes .
what did you tell him ?
i asked him to bring corn liquor .
no .
really , i don' t need it .
ha !
not for you .
for boy .
me ?
he pass out soon .
she' il be fine .
she just needs rest .
don' t worry .
she' il be fine .
hey !
it' s his favorite thing in the world that stupid ball .
it was our dad' s back on earth .
every time he kicks that thing , my brother thinks he' s in a big grass field .
that' s some imagination .
yeah , well .
there .
he had a little help .
see what i mean ?
that' s him our dad .
that' s where my brother got the idea .
hmm .
here on the colony , most people got to shut their eyes ... to see anything other than rusted spaceship hulls .
not my brother .
later .
hey .
sleeping beauty .
how long was i out ?
not long .
a few hours .
korso and preed .
i can' t believe it .
how long before they reach the titan ?
they won' t .
we' re gonna beat them to it .
akima , we' re gonna stop them .
was i seriously injured back there or something ,
' cause , funny , i thought you just said we' re gonna stop them ?
that' s right .
cale , we' re in the middle of nowhere .
there' s just the two of us , and , oh , yeah we don' t have a ship .
oh , we' ve got a ship .
really ?
mm hmm .
i' d like to see this ... ship .
check it out .
oh , no .
oh , yes !
well , she' s been a great house , but i don' t think she' il fly .
well , she' s still got her ionic vacuum drive .
those never drain .
this thing' s a wreck .
i can fix it , but do you think
don' t worry .
i can fly it .
good , ' cause we launch yesterday .
# i' ve gotta get away from here #
# it couldn' t be too soon #
# ' cause i' ve seen the stars for you and me #
# like rockets to the moon #
# you take me everywhere that i' ve never been #
# show me the meaning of what life had to give #
# i don' t know what to say #
# i think that maybe i' m in over my head #
# stuck in the bed somethin ' she said # ow !
# makes me think that i' m in over my head #
# over my head #
t minus ten , nine , eight , seven ,
six , five , well , we' re good to go . four , three , let' s hope she starts . two , oh , she' il start . one , zero .
yeah , right .
she' il start .
uh , i' d lean back if i were you .
should i get out and push ?
told ya .
okay .
you did your job .
now let me do mine .
these collisions keep slowing us down .
so where is it ?
my scanners are picking up a veritable cornucopia of ... nothing .
just find it !
gune , are you sure about that map ?
you give me map .
i follow map .
what more can gune do ?
if professor screwloose over there led us off course , i' m going to  hold it !
what is it ?
a ship .
three keks east .
drej ?
no .
human craft , heading for the break zone .
moving fast .
how fast ?
i' d say recklessly fast .
akima .
ah , good !
akima .
cale .
i i hail on communicator .
no hailing .
just follow them .
okay .
i follow , but i plot new route through safer quadrant .
if we
we' re going to follow them , and we' il run silent .
the reflections are throwing my readings off .
uh , akima , i think we' re getting closer .
cale !
it' s korso .
huh ?
he' s right behind us .
what ?
we' ve got to lose him .
we' il never find them in there .
we' re going in .
stith , where are they ?
i can' t get a reading .
there' s too much ice , too much interference , captain .
captain .
whoa !
a heat signature .
i see them !
where are they ?
behind us !
no !
where is he ?
i i don' t know .
what ?
well , we found them , captain .
no more heat readings .
all gone .
until they make their move , we stay here .
they' re moving out , i think .
now we' ve got ' em .
i can' t move .
they' il see us .
maybe that' s exactly what we want .
a reading !
yeah .
they' re right in front of us .
you' re not gonna get past me , kid .
there , captain !
that' s right , cale .
keep coming .
closer .
they' re getting closer !
there she is , captain .
no .
there , captain .
which one ?
look !
they' re behind us now !
ready lasers !
i' m on it !
i need one clear shot .
don' t lose ' em .
ice !
turn back !
no way .
we' il never make it through .
we don' t have a choice .
akima !
uh  yes , cale ?
pull up !
shut up !
let' s not do that again .
hold it .
look there .
akima , turn around .
turn around !
that' s it .
wow .
have you ever seen anything like it ?
once .
what exactly are we looking for ?
this ship' s gonna help us save mankind .
what exactly are we looking for ?
not a clue .
dna coding .
mammal .
tursiops truncatus .
the bottle nosed dolphin .
these are animals or or they will be .
leopard .
papilio glaucus .
swallowtail butterfly .
it' s all here .
cale ?
i' m over here !
look at this .
dad .
i could never have done anything like this when i was your age .
i wonder who you take after ?
hey .
the titan .
quick .
ready to go , captain .
you two stay here .
preed and i can wrap this up .
but here .
hold on to this in case there' s any trouble .
hmm .
n n n n no .
those two are becoming a problem .
we need to take care of it .
i' m one step ahead of you .
watch the ship .
i always watch the ship .
no , this just doesn' t feel right .
i wanna go !
i wanna go !
captain said stay .
it' s captain i don' t trust .
hmm .
you know , you may be right .
come on .
stith here .
stith , is gune right there with you ?
yeah .
then please tell him good bye for me , won' t you ?
what ?
gune !
i knew it !
i knew it !
get out of there !
cale .
if this message has  dad ?
if this message has been activated , then i have died before finding you .
i hope you can forgive me ... for breaking my promise to see you again .
what i wouldn' t give to see you now .
i can' t change the past , cale , but i hope i can give you a future .
this ship has the power to create a planet , to create a new home .
your ring would have activated the transformation sequence , but the titan' s power cells were drained in the escape .
they are unable to fuel the transformation .
it is up to you to restore their power .
after that , the procedure is simple .
he always did talk too much .
oh !
ah ah ah .
korso , don' t do this .
this ship is all we have left .
doesn' t that mean anything to you ?
sorry , kid .
world blowing up changes a man .
look .
the drej  see , you can' t beat the drej .
no one can .
they' re pure energy .
face it , cale .
you' ve lost .
actually , you all have .
captain , if you' il relieve yourself of your firearm
you backstabbing  well , i learned from the best .
but it wasn' t just the money the drej were offering .
it was the health plan that came with it .
they' d let me live provided i kill all of you before they get here .
they should be here shortly .
gune ?
gune ?
gune !
gune , are you all right ?
i' m i' m all right f for business .
gune .
i' il just take a little nap ... since i' m so very sleepy .
ahh .
preed , you can' t trust the drej .
akima .
oh , stop !
there' s nothing more tiresome than last minute heroics !
captain ?
mm .
oh .
hide ' n ' seek , is it ?
or should we play ... search and destroy !
preed !
ah !
give me the ring .
aw .
you' re not gonna shoot me , kid .
cale !
ah .
aah !
hold on !
oh !
you can let go , kid .
i wouldn' t blame you .
no !
i' m not gonna let go !
korso !
cale !
the drej !
you okay ?
yeah .
let' s not panic .
we' ve gotta get out of here before the drej arrive .
no , i think we' re gonna stay right here .
right here is about to be blown apart .
this could be a good thing .
wait .
come on , cale !
wait .
we can make this work .
what did korso say about the drej ?
that you can' t beat them .
right !
because they' re pure energy .
if i can reroute the system to use drej energy , that would start the reactor .
the energy relays are linked to these circuit breakers , so this should do it .
yes !
are you sure this will work ?
come on !
i can fix this !
i need to get outside .
can you and stith cover me ?
i i just need a little time .
how much time ?
uh , a few hours !
what can you do in a few minutes ?
here they come .
not if i can help it .
cale , you' re a sitting duck up there .
i' m all right .
oh !
come on !
whoo !
oh , fantastic .
i only have two guns left .
let' s make ' em count .
akima , i can' t shake ' em .
i' ve got him .
ah !
i' m out !
let' s do this !
whoo !
well , guys , it' s been fun .
a little help here , akima .
whoa !
cale !
i finished my nap !
gune !
who' s your daddy ?
gune' s your daddy !
oh , no !
no , no , no , no !
oh !
cale , are you all right ?
i' m pinned .
stith , who' s outside with cale ?
hi , kid .
it' s korso !
you' il never get a cleaner shot , korso .
maybe we can beat ' em after all .
go ahead .
i' il cover you .
yeah , yeah .
right .
okay .
oh , great .
fry , drej !
ah !
they' re leaving .
uh oh .
we got a problem .
go .
they' re joining the mother ship .
but the breaker !
cale , she' s preparing to fire !
you can' t stay out here .
i' il take care of it , so let' s move .
go on .
get out of here .
cale , where are you ?
go .
it' s better this way .
uh
here they come again .
come on .
faster .
faster .
come on .
this is amazing .
i know .
what are you going to call it ?
i think i' il call it ...
bob .
bob ?
you don' t like " bob " ?
you can' t call a planet " bob " .
oh , so now you' re the boss .
you' re the king of bob .
well , no , but  what ?
can' t you just call it earth ?
well , no one said you had to live on bob .
i' m never ... calling it that .
