what if i told you ...
i know exactly what you do ! and how you do it ! and i think it' s despicable .
you know what ?
we might need to go out to dinner .
yeah , there is a great sea food restaurant i love to take you to .
how about you just get a cleaver butcher ?

yar , i tried that once and it didn' t go well ...
that is what you did ! and i did like you !
i just didn' t know i was been worked over by some professional !
he doesn' t have badge .
you know the only time you were sincere and spontaneous was when everything was going horribly wrong or you were stoned out of your head !
i am sorry to interrupt ... do i know you ?
no , i don' t think so .
you wanna see you being spontaneous ?
sure , you wanna benedryl ?

my job is not to deceive , mrs. cole .
is to create opportunities .
like the boardroom ?
would you have noticed him otherwise ?
yes !
really ?
eventually
maybe
how did you know all the stuff about me ?
well , you really did your homework .
like the boarding school when everyone used to tease me because i couldn' t whistle . and having him dance like a buffoon knowing that i can' t dance either .
and telling him to drop mustard on his shirt
so i feel less like a dork .
that was all you ?
right ?
no , hell no !
that was him ?
that' s got albert written all over it .
did you put him up the inhaler ?
stop it !
he did not show you that !
he chucked it right before he kissed me .
