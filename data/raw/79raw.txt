japan coast guard
umlzaru
since joining the coast guard , i' ve witnessed 9 maritime accidents .
each one , however , from the deck of a boat .
each time , i wished i could be in the water .
the 14 of you have come recommended by your regional headquarters ... to undergo special training as search and rescue divers .
only 1 % of all japan coast guard officers earn such a distinction .
it is my earnest hope that all of you will have what it takes to endure ... the most rigorous training of your lives .
attention !
salute !
at ease !
your chief training instructor !
trainees , salute !
at ease !
my name is taro minamoto .
for the next 50 days ...

you all sound very noble .
and full of shit !
nomura !

for the status , right ?
kudo !
to save lives , sir !
the real reason !
to save lives , sir .
and you ?
boredom on deck , sir .
boredom ?
i want to work on the front lines , sir .
you think that' s a lot of fun , do you ?
senzaki , they tell me you have a master diver' s license .
yes .
jerk .
friendly drill sergeant .
50 days with hitler .
i hate him already .
what' s a " master diver' s license ?
it means he' s semi pro .
i' ve been diving since high school .
no way !
you' re not the only one with one of those .
10 minutes elapsed !
remember , you' re trainees !
you' re nothing special !
i' ve reached my limit , sir !
you have ?
kudo ... if you had , you' d be dead now .
you' re still alive .
add 2 kilos !
come on .
sink or swim !
keep those hands dry !
ready ... go !
if you can' t save your own ass ... how can you save others ?
lives are at stake here !
not bad .
senzaki and ...
mishima .
this is heaven !
i thought i' d die out there .
i hope it' s easier tomorrow .
food !
i haven' t the strength to eat .
look at those two .
they didn' t break a sweat .
diving masters .
i told you so .
i wanna go home !
sakai , nakahara ...
muto , tadokoro ...
kudo , senzaki ...
gunji , watanabe ...
tsuchiya , nomura ...
hayashi , yaegashi ...
mishima , kawaguchi ...
meet your " buddy " for the next 50 days .
buddy ?
we always work in pairs underwater .
the " buddy " relationships are founded upon trust .
understood ?
pleasure .
same here .
one minute and 30 seconds .
one minute remaining .
water clear !
ready ...
dive !
commence gear exchange .
don' t waste time !
check your residual pressure .
the slowest pair does 100 push ups .
72 ...
73 ...
i' m sorry .
74 !
500 meter dolphin relay !
go !
the slowest team cleans latrines .
hurry up !
sorry .
what' s that stench ?
latrines .
now i reek , too .
poor senzaki .
don' t get in my way .
i know .
finished already ?
i' m not hungry .
eat up !
you need your strength .
that' s right .
why' d you pair those two ?
they' re too different .
it' s not fair to senzaki .
you can' t pamper a guy like that .
i see your point .
on repeated dives ... you must know how much time you need to depressurize .
your body builds up nitrogen underwater .
once out of the water , you must stay there ... until the nitrogen in your system returns to safe levels .
after a 20 minute dive , for example ... you need to stay out of the water for at least an hour .
otherwise , you' re at risk of getting the bends .
why don' t you tutor him ?
this is where your dive time chart is important .
say you and your " buddy " are left alone at a depth of 40 meters .
you have one tank and 30 bar .
enough for a return trip ... for one .
what do you do ?
what ?
time' s up .
you' re all dead .
let me explain the time for reducing pressure after a dive .
what' s with that guy ?
got your manuscript .
good .
sorry for cutting out on you .
no sweat .
take care of your mom .
it' s about ready to print , anyway .
just proof it and email it back to me .
not bad for your first article .
really ?
got to go .
bye .
goodbye .
you get used to training after a week .
but barracks life gets harder .
no matter what happens , remember you' re in training .
the locals call you " sea monkeys .
because of the way some before you have acted in town .
practice discretion .
understood ?
you' re free tonight .
abstinence
hey !
what did i just say ? !
give me your number !
get away from me .
i haven' t got time for a boyfriend .
i' m building work skills .
no interest in men at all ?
if the opportunity arises .
wow , tokyo' s changed you .
i' ve hit on a guy , like , once .
you , erika ?
how ?
i said , " i bet you' d like to kiss me .
i read in a magazine it works every time .
then what ?
then i slept with him .
i was piss drunk .
i went out with him for about a year , i think .
really .
coast what ?
coast guard .
sea monkeys .
14 of the nicest boys you' il meet !
care for a drink ?
pride shattered .
we' re getting nowhere !
nobody likes us .
kudo , were you the best your region had to offer ?
excuse me ?
chief called you the worst recruit ever .
don' t make us look bad , okay ?
we don' t want to fail ' cause of you .
pick it up , okay ?
get with it .
sorry .
hold it ...
he' s doing his best .
give him a break .
he pisses you off more than anyone else .
so don' t act cool .
likewise .
chill out , guys .
sarge will eat us alive if we start fighting .
you don' t wanna fight .
neither do you .
coast guard ?
every year , they get local girlfriends ... and dump them once training' s over .
same old " sea monkeys . " i hate ' em .
two minutes elapsed .
and the winner is mishima !
let' s get an interview !
aw come on !
here' s the culprit !
nothing' s changed around here .
i told you .
i wish i could go to tokyo like you .
you' re on call tomorrow , right ?
get some rest .
i hate the early shift .
see ya .
good night .
watch it !
i' m packing a lot of stress .
get over here .
two guys pestering one girl ?
that' s pitiful .
okay , knock it off .
go home !
chill out .
listen to me .
what did you expect ?
a girl like you drinking alone .
wait a second .
is that a compliment ?
are you saying i' m attractive ?
you' re wasted .
right now ...
i bet you' d like to kiss me .
get a load of this classy room !
are you new to this ?
yeah , my boyfriends have always had apartments .
this feels wonderful !
bright ...
it' s too bright .
thirsty ?
i still don' t know your name .
does that matter ?
guess not .
water ...
check .
buddy " ... check .

hey .
hey !
you' ve got to be kidding .
you' ve got to be kidding .
what is this place ?
who is this person ?
who' re you ?

i absolutely despise guys that do this kind of thing .
you brought me here .

i' m with the coast guard .
i' m late for training .

attention !
all trainees present and accounted for , sir !
entering an overturned vessel .
a fishing boat has capsized ... full of fishing nets and other obstacles .
one of you is blindfolded , and you share one tank .
work stops at 50 bar .
under 50 bar , you must surface .
nomura ok .
tsuchiya ok .
6 minutes , 30 seconds .
bar remaining ?
30 .
you missed the cutoff .
you' ve both died in action .
next !
senzaki and kudo .
your " buddy " needs air .
senzaki' s down !
he' s blacked out !
we' ve got him !
what' s your problem , kudo !
you' ve got to stay calm .
you almost killed me .
how' re you doing , mr. senzaki ?
fine .
the doctor will be here shortly to check up on you .
roger ...
latrine ?
go out , turn right .
but i emailed you my corrections .
you didn' t get them ?
wait , i' il try again .
how about now ?
got it ?
great .
no ... it' s nothing .
what ?
yes , i can do that .
femme ?
don' t touch that .
no , i' m fine .
i can work from here .
i won' t cause any ... damn !
i can' t use my cell phone here .
at any rate , i' il be back as soon as ...
you work for a magazine !
i thought you were a local .
may i have that , please ?
why' re you working from a hospital ?
and who are you ?
you remember .
i do not .
i took her to a seaside hotel .
what' re you doing ?
stop that !
jog your memory ?
why are you following me around ?
like i said ... it was you who hit on me .
something i live to regret .
and a dorky " sea monkey " at that .
sorry if i fail your high standards .
look , i was drunk .
did i ... really , you know ... " do it " with you ?
like a monkey , babe .
creep .
who' s he calling a monkey ?
couldn' t send your article ?
don' t worry , mom .
you rushed back on my account .
of course i' m worried .
i got it .
don' t move .
you all right ?
hajime kudo , japan coast guard .
we' re both in the business of saving lives .
we' re kindred spirits .
kobayashi' s stool sample !
gotta go .
see ya later .
ow !
snap out of it .
what' re you looking at ?
at ease !
10 minutes !
senzaki ... your belt' s twisted in back .
blame your " buddy .
what say you , kudo ?
i thought i checked him thoroughly , sir .
you' ve done this repeatedly .
give me 50 push ups .
you too , senzaki .
do it with your regulators on !
you can do it , kudo .
you can do it !
together !
standard operational procedure .
if you can' t do it on land ... you' il fail in the water .
keep up , kudo .
sorry .
he' s not rescue diver material .
he lacks strength and concentration .
encourage him to quit , or pay for it later .
you know that , don' t you ?
excuse me !
there' re some people on the rocks .
what rocks ?
out there .
it doesn' t look safe .
what the hell are they doing ?
excuse me .
we' re the coast guard .
the coast guard ?
when the tide rises , you' il be trapped .
please evacuate immediately .
if it gets dangerous , we' il leave .
you' ve been drinking .
your judgment is ...
buzz off .
who gives you the right to order us around ?
and look dorky , too .
that' s a cute little life jacket .
orange suits you .
seriously .
it' s dangerous .
we hear you .
now leave .
go away !
go away !
hey mishima !
wait !
if they want to die , let them .
say that again ?
i said don' t be stupid .
my taxes pay your salary , you runt !
kudo !
this is a first .
coast guard officers in a brawl with local civilians !
our apologies , sir .
they were violating public safety rules , sir .
that' s right .
that' s not the point .
you are public servants .
so get that into your thick skulls !
look what happened to you !
i hear kudo was the first to snap .
mishima didn' t lay a hand on them .
that' s professionalism .
he' s an adult .
kudo' s a child .
i' m sorry .
my fault again .
tell me ... just what is our job ?
we went to help ... and they spat in our faces .
we got them to leave , didn' t we ?
you should be pissed off .
back home , my father and brother ... are fishermen .
when they' re out at sea in a storm , my mom just sits there and prays .
bring them home safely , " she says .
ever since i was a kid ...
i vowed to rescue them if they were ever in danger .
so you joined the coast guard .
yeah .
i' m glad we helped those people .
mishima ...
i was thinking ...
let' s graduate top of our class .
i' il work hard .
all right , " buddy ?
why didn' t you join the rest ?
sir ?
you let your " buddy " get beat up .
you advocating fighting , sir ?
keep pumping .
you need this to pass pool training .
i' m spent .
shift the weight to your pelvis !
come on !
it' s no use .
i can' t hack it .
sure you can .
it' s pointless .
no , it' s not .
you' re a basket case , kudo !
time for a skinny dip !
enough of peeing in my wetsuit .
what' re you doing ?
no fair practicing on the side .
we' re in this together .
think of us as ... your trusty " clutch .
you mean " crutch .
disperse !
water clear !
check !
take positions !
dive !
weirdos .
lower your chin , kudo !
so you swallow water , big deal .
raise those hips , man !
you' re too vertical .
10 meters to go !
9 ... 8 ... 7 ... 6 ... 5 ...
finish , kudo !
all trainees present and accounted for , sir !
next week , we start training at sea .
and you' re not ready .
you faint during training .
you fight off duty .
you think with your peckers .
you' re not ready for the sea .
so we' re conducting this final pool test .
if you fail any of the tasks today ... you' re out !
2 minutes , 30 seconds .
14 minutes elapsed .
one minute left !
paddle !
paddle !
come on !
25 meters to go , kudo !
5 ... 4 ... 3 ... 2 ... 1 !
this is your final task .
anyone who can' t lift 20 kilos , fails !
almost there .
try again .
i can' t .
i can' t do it !
it' s too heavy .
you' re almost there .
i know you can do it .
now go !
you can do it !
keep coming !
keep coming !
don' t give up on me , damn it !
keep it coming !
keep it coming !
you did it , kudo !
bottoms up !
nurses !
we' ve got nurses !
i must be dreaming !
i love you , kudo !
who' d have thought you' d have a hotline to a nurse station ?
he was like a raging bull !
went straight for nurse erika .
i wish he' d use that energy in training .
a guy' s looks are important .
that' s marine self defense .
we' re japan coast guard .
our boats are white .
hey senzaki .
thanks .
i owe you one .
save it .
we' re only halfway there .
true .
we' il make it , though .
i' m glad you' re my " buddy .
i won' t let you down .
i promise .
i hate blind dates .
she' s a friend of erika' s .
i think i' il pass .
but you' re my " buddy !
within limits .
no , " buddies " are inseparable .
what a great day for a dive !
the sea looks beautiful !
water everywhere !
hey , isn' t that senzaki and kudo ?
good afternoon , gents !
what' re you doing here ?
what a coincidence !
this is a good spot .
mishima' s here too ?
you knew we were diving here .
leave us alone .
why should we ?
look !
hi boys !
now just hold on !
you brought a friend ?
this is kanna .
move closer !
gloves on ?
your hand , please .
i thought you hated " sea monkeys .
i was bored .
what' s a city girl doing here anyway ?
none of your business .
in the water , you stay close , you hear ?
i hear you .
that was incredible !
it' s so beautiful !
told you so .
hey !
keep your hands to yourself .
don' t flatter yourself .
my mom' s in the hospital .
what ?
she broke her leg falling down some stairs .
i see .
so you came back here .
my father died when i was little .
it' s just the two of us .
the dutiful daughter .
stop it .
truth is ...
i' m panicked .
this is a critical time at work .
they gave me my first full page at the magazine .
i can' t be wasting time here .
so that' s why .
what ?
why you seem so stressed out .
i must be to sleep with someone i just met .
i' d better go .
hey , where' d everyone go ?
still diving , maybe .
let' s continue diving , then .
we can' t .
