shit !
jan !
what a pain !
bastard !
do you think it was a good idea to move in with jan ?
jan is totally alright .
you just have to know him better .
i dunno .
sometimes he gives me this really aggressive look .
really scary .
jule , i' ve known jan for 15 years .
he' s a little unpredictable .
but he' s a loyal soul .
and he' s got a backbone .
not many people do .
i dunno .
he' s kind of weird .
what' s that ?
oxygen concentrator ...
he bought it " used " the other day .
really ?
are you excited about going to barcelona ?
sure !
are you excited ?
it' s just that my debts are out of control .
baby , it' s my treat .
completely .
we' il have a great time .
you just don' t get it .
i have to straighten this out .
beating yourself up wont make things better .
try to relax !
just forget it .
hello .
man , we have to find a new approach .
take it to another level .
everything is fine .
bullshit !
we need to see things ... in a larger context .
what are you talking about ?
forget it !
got a light ?
check in my bag .
no .
look in the small one .
open your eyes !
what is this ?
looks like a watch to me .

yeah , i' il do that .
ok .

if we can' t agree , then let' s just drop it .
ok , man .
i got it .
but in kreuzberg , i know this turk ...
he would have given me 2500 for it .
we could have split 50/ 50 .
you don' t get it and you don' t want to !
but it was just sitting there ...
so shiny , calling out to me .
it' s green .
change the station .
so far , so far away from home ...
shit it won' t get any louder .
no hellos , no hearts , no kisses
no sorrow .
everything so far , so far away .
the best of times
you asshole ! ... where flowers bloom , where my sweetheart lives ...
one more time !
fucking awesome !
miss !
we ordered williams pear brandy .
that' s william pear brandy .
but never in these glasses !
these are liqueur glasses .
so ?
can' t beverages be served in their proper glasses ?
i simply cannot drink from this glass .
thank you .
just a moment , please .
by the way ...
don' t use the same brandy .
it' s lost its flavor , understand ?
yes , by all means .
table 47 prefers brandy glasses .
you have more customers .
at table 22 .
dream on your own time !
be careful getting home !
sweet dreams .
you too .
can' t you do something else ?
putting up those posters doesn' t pay much .
plus , you' re out all night .
yeah , i' m sick of it too .
but there' s nothing else
good night .
what ?
you can' t go ?
i have to turn over the apartment .
that asshole !
i can' t believe it .
it' s only 3 days .
i don' t get it .
shit !
then i' m staying too .
no , this is your big break .
you have to go alone .
i' il find someone to help you , ok ?
sorry , i overslept .
you can use this one .
here ?
maybe over there .
how about some music ?
is that jeff cole ?
i saw him in concert .
at the columbia ?
i was there .
funny , i didn' t see you !
this is a great place .
why move ?
i can' t afford it .
your debts ?
peter told you ?
he mentioned it .
that idiot .
it' s not a big deal .
we all have debts .
but not like me .
i probably can' t compeed but ...
how much ?
1000 euros ?
10000 euros ?
more ?
20000 ?
30000 ?
jan , please ...
don' t ruin my day .
94500 .
euros ?
what did you do ?
burn down a factory ?
if only .
a year ago , on the highway ...
i was in my old golf .
ahead of me , this executive driving his mercedes s class .
he brakes .
i don' t .
his car is totaled .
my registration had expired .
i hadn' t paid my insurance .
that fucking mercedes cost 100000 euros .
but i' m now down to 94500 .
you work your butt off so that some big shot can drive a mercedes ?
for executives like him ...
that car is petty cash .
but it was my fault .
he was in the right
in the right ?
is that justice ?
you are paying for some jerk' s lifestyle .
a 100000 euro car ?
why not gold plated pipes ?
it makes me sick too !
i should never have reached for the glove compartment .
i screwed up .
now i pay the price .
who says that ?
the cops ?
the prosecutors , the news rags ?
fucking petty bourgeois ethic !
decency , honesty , family values ...
get to work on time , pay your taxes ...
all hammered into us .
first in school , then on tv .
for what ?
so guys like that can buy expensive cars ?
to hell with those morals !
ruining a young woman' s life is immoral .
think that guy ever thought he was wrong ?
you are right .
but i missed a payment once ...
they were knocking on my door .
recognizing injustice .
action .
but how ?
take the first step alone .
find allies for the second .
from where ?
take the first step , then call me .
i calculated how much of my life ...
i' m giving to that asshole ...
just for fun .
and ?
about 8 years .
but only once i' m a teacher .
that' s what you want to do ?
better than waitressing .
and before the accident ?
concretely ...
i guess i wanted ...
this might sound stupid .
i guess i just wanted to live wild an free .
that' s not stupid .
it' s ok .
that' s what half of us want .
then come the compromises .
that' s how it goes .
not necessarily .
sometimes not .
some people make it .
anyhow ...
if you keep working for that asshole , you' il loose faith in everything .
i go this way .
i go that way .
thanks again .
if you still need help ,
i can come again .
great !
sure .
so where are you headed ?
sleeping at a girlfriend' s .
how about you ?
i think i' il cook something .
want to join me ?
gladly .
days of plenty .
all washed up ?
shall we cook ?
jan , it was great .
guys who can cook must get all the girls .
not really .
other things count more .
you join me for a smoke ?
i don' t know .
it' s dessert .
dope chokes young people' s revolutionary energy .
grass too ?
no , grass is ok .
the drugs the body produces aren' t bad either .
actually , they' re greats .
like adrenalin ?
for example .
there are thousands .
endorphins ...
happiness hormones when you are in love ...
now you' re talking hard drugs .
watch out for those .
don' t fall into a life of crime !
fear is an awesome drug .
don' t let fear take control .
use it as a motor .
it takes practice .
put yourself into a situation where you' re scared stiff .
first there' s panic .
but after a while , the body' s self protection system kicks in .
you do things you never dared .
you overcome you limitations .
you believe you can do anything .
really !
do you know it or think it ?
i know it .
done it a thousand times . a thousand times gone bad ...
run a check on that plate .
it' s ok .
it works if you smear it .
it' s not good wallpaper .
how come ?
the glue isn' t right .
but i followed the instructions .
shit !
you know what ?
fuck the deposit !
we should have done this before .
it works .
hope they' il like it .
look .
every heart is a revolutionary cell .
smile !
excuse me ...
your hair !
yes , i' il fix it .
roast beef with potatoes and summer vegetables .
we should smoke downstairs in the storeroom .
why not tell him too ?
that way he can say all we do is smoke .
you' re right .
there you are !
the place is packed .
just fixing my hair .
i can tell .
are you crazy ?
in the kitchen ?
i' m truly sorry , .
what were you thinking ?
know what ?
i' ve had it with you .
that' s enough .
you' re fired .
no , boss .
i need this job .
it' s my fault .
i smoked first .
i said it was ok .
then you are fired too .
what ?
pack it up !
wait , jule .
let me .
boss , wait !
why can' t i shut up ?
what for ?
it' s great that you defended him .
yeah sure .
but i need that job , you see .
no , i don' t see .
you go to all those protests ... against exploitation and oppression ... but you' re still some bastard' s slave .
those protests are totally useless .
the rebellion is difficult now .
before , all it took was dope and long hair .
and the establishment was automatically against you .
what was considered subversive then you can buy in shops today .
che guevara t shirts or anarchy stickers .
that' s why there aren' t any more youth movements .
everyone has the feeling it' s all be done before .
others tried and failed .
why should it work for us ?
for all revolutions , one thing is clear ...
even if some didn t work , the most important thing is ... that the best ideas survived .
the same goes for personal revolts .
what turns out good ... what survives in you ... that makes you stronger .
what do you think ?
how many people down there are thinking about revolution ?
in this moment , not many .
at 10 : 45 , they are watching tv .
probably .
europeans spend 4 hours a day in front of the boob tube .
4 hours !
terrible !
doesn' t leave much time for revolutionary thoughts .
you know ...
not being part of all that ... that' s not the problem .
the problem is ...
i can' t find anything i really want to believe in .
got any ideas for me ?
follow me .
now what ?
who lives here ?
you never wondered why
peter and i stay out all night ?
to put up posters .
what else ?
then ...
what do you do ?
we are driving around looking for villas .
when we find one we like ... we take a closer look .
then what ?
you take pretty photos and put them in an album ?
is this a joke ?
we break into them .
just one catch .
we don' t steal anything .
we re arrange the furniture .
and we leave a message .
your days of plenty are numbered " or " you have too much money " ... signed " the edukators
you and peter are the edukators ?
why ?
so they feel less safe ... in their high security neighborhoods .
it' s a creepy feeling ...
someone has been in your home .
they have been watching you .
and they will keep watching you .
why not empty the villas and give everything to the poor ?
they expect burglars .
we want to really scare them .
you have too much money ...
you have too much money ...
they' il feel completely alone .
nothing can help them .
not money , not a spouse , not any damn cop .
are you serious ?
i' il show you .
guess where the camera is ?
behind the grill .
skeleton key ...
look at this .
peter found this list .
the x' s mark our hits .
this is real .
no way ...
this is insane .
how did it start ?
not a clue .
peter installed alarm systems .
i once asked him ... if he knew how to disable an alarm system .
he said no problem .
so we did it
you two ...
isn' t this zehelendorf ?
which street ?
finkenbachstrasse .
no way !
wait ...
shit !
jan , shit !
take a left down there , ok ?
now i' il show you !
that must be it , there !
stop , pull over there .
i think that asshole ...
i owe money to lives there .
what are you doing ?
he really lives here .
the mailbox is full .
they must be away .
let' s take a look .
down at the lake we can get in .
don' t be a drag !
let' s just take a peek .
wait up !
see ?
check out this place !
with boat and private dock ...
the blinds are down .
they must be on vacation .
don' t be so sure .
how would you break in ?
maybe through a cellar window .
let' s go closer !
doesn' t that look like the ideal point of entry ?
totally hidden .
it could work .
let' s break .
you' re insane .
no way !
i have to see how that asshole lives .
please !
this is too spontaneous .
it' s too risky
but you' re a pro .
i just want a peek !
jule , i' m not a pro .
we have to monitor the house first .
you can see no one' s home .
please !
we can come back a few times .
then do it with peter .
they' il be back then .
but only if the house is on file , which i really doubt .
agreed .
shit !
what ?
bingo !
what ?
we' ve got his alarm system .
we are going in ?
i' il only have 30 seconds to find the main console .
we do it edukators style .
agreed .
once i open the window , i' il have only 30 seconds .
when the alarm is off , i' il come for you .
so i wait here ?
yes .
jan , check out the pool .
come on !
let' s make sure no one' s home .
it' s ok .
i told you ... petty cash .
what are you doing ?
don' t panic .
less conspicuous than a flashlight .
you can take off you mask .
no one' s home .
this is him .
he needs cooling off .
and vertically ?
got it ?
awesome !
looks much better now !
you have too much money .
the edukators .
ok , let' s go .
come on , jan .
let' s do something extreme .
i need to work off some aggression .
please !
you' re crazy .
we have been here to long .
let' s throw the couch in the pool .
it' s a great idea .
come on !
let' s do it !
then we' il go .
will it pass ?
it' s hot here .
first things first !
one ... two ...
three !
come on
help me .
idiot !
what' s that ?
it' s me !
where from ?
jule , give it back .
come and get it ..
wait here .
i' il be right back .
don' t do this , man .
jan , let' s go now !
pack our things .
i' il be right back .
got everything ?
shit !
what' s wrong ?
cops !
that was so awesome !
i' d love to see hardenberg' s face ! when he comes home and finds his couch in the pool .
it was the best , i tell you .
38 degrees ... the whole city is one big party .
but what was really the best ...
i found this in barcelona .
look .
strange edukators ...
nasty surprise for berlin family , upon return from vacation ,
perpetrators had broken into their villa .
but nothing was stolen .
only furniture and valuables were moved .
the edukators .
police still have no solid leads to their identities " .
which paper ?
the tagesanzeiger .
super .
i got this for jule .
think she' il like it ?
it' s perfect for her .
wake up , man .
you seem out of it .
that must be jule .
how are you ?
and you ?
everything ok ?
i have to tell you something .
wait ...
i brought you something .
we have to talk .
i left my phone at the villa .
what ?
really ?
i' m pretty sure .
i know i had it in the car before .
it' s not in my bag anymore .
don' t tell peter .
why not ?
just don' t tell him anything .
look .
isn' t it nice ?
try it on .
he really needs a chick .
i' m sure that would help .
really .
jan , see her ?
she' s been checking you out .
isn' t she sweet ?
is she sweet or what ?
so ask her to dance .
leave him alone .
want me to ask for you ?
i' il ask her .
sleep well .
you , too .
bye .
i' m going for a walk .
i need some air .
come in , man .
let' s have a drink .
put your oxygen on .
not today .
i' il stay out for a while .
i' m off to bed .
let' s get out here .
i have a bad feeling .
we need to find your phone .
but maybe they already saw the hole in the window .
what would you tell the cops ?
hardenberg know you .
jan , please .
no .
we have to go back in .
want to go to jail ?
it s not here .
where was the jacket ?

of course .
then we can' t go .

we can' t just go !
think hard !
what are we going to do ?
fucking shit !
not a clue !
not a clue , man !
i don' t know what to do !
i don' t either !

why not ?
because , no .
but why not ?

just call him !
it can' t be ...
this is jule .
jan and i are in big shit .
we need your help .
please come right away .
is this necessary ?
just run away .
the police don' t have to know .
i won' t say anything .
maybe he won' t talk .
let' s just go .

that guy lies all day long !
shit !
he dialed the cops .
did the call go through ?
we have to go .
but we ...
we' re out of time , ok ?
he is coming with us .
can' t we come to a solution ?
shut up !
i won' t be a kidnapper !
you can' t pull out now !

we' il take him and decide later .
end of discussion .
this is crazy !
open the door .
