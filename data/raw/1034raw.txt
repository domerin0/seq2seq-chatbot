there' il be war .
there' s a problem with his money .
due to the imminent danger of war we blocked his money .
idiot left it in the bank .
we reckon he belongs to some fairly suspicious groups .
harvey ? !
yes .
do you know harvey ?
he' s like a little baby .
the worst kind .
that money , you know .
it' s not his money .
he invested it in our film , so now it' s ours .

bosa said we' ve finished filming .
bosa ?

you all need a damn good kick up the arse .
fucking slave driver .
what' s up ?
a few bombs and you artists shit your pants !
it' s ok for mr. producer to show up when the war' s over !
bombs are falling , and he ...
cut the crap , tatula !
what did he say ?
he said you' re a deaf commie .
what ?
i didn' t hear .
the sirens went off and then the windows smashed ... where ?
upstairs .
it seems anyone can stop filming whenever they want !
i can stop whenever i want !
you haven' t paid us .
there' s no money for the tapes .
and you strut around belgrade with that american .
i don' t want to see him ever again .
anywhere .
is that clear ?
if you want to know who stopped filming , i' il tell you .
he did !
and as for communism , that' s none of your business .
what' s that about communism ?
he' s winding you up .
you want me to kick the shit out of you , huh ?
what shall i do with this guy ?
who is it ?
ugrinovic again ?
no , the police .
please , don' t take him to my place .
my mom' s sick .
hey , sergei , sorry i' m late .
tatula' s only j ... j ... just told me about the money .
pay day , eh ! ?
no .
tatula , you f ... f ... fucking lying bastard .
why' s he b ... b ... bleeding ?
yeah !
we' re at home lola , where else ?
no , the phone' s in the other room .
masa' s sleeping .
everything' s fine .
we' re waiting for you .
good evening .
good evening .
good evening .
daddy said that you' re the best guy in the crew .
really ?
and did daddy bring any money ?
no .
but he brought harvey to sleep at your place .
good evening .
i' il throw both of you off the balcony .
not in front of the kid , tatula .
shh , i' ve only just got her off to sleep .
idiot .
what' s happening , sergei ?
what' il become of us ?
where' ve you been the whole night ?
which question do you want me to answer first ?
you' re probably the only man not to come home tonight .
there was a problem on set .
fuck the set !
don' t swear .
why were the police looking for you ?
where were they looking for me ?
here .
they left this .
they were here , too ?
what' s going on , segei ?
it' s because of harvey ...
our harvey ?
he' s an american , and so they hate him .
why are they bombing us ?
war is the best business .
it' il only be for a few days .
what does ' a few days ' mean ?
it means this isn' t one of your big wars like 1941 .
how can you eat now ?
what ?
i' m supposed to starve because there' s a war on .
even in world war two people still ate .
fuck , there they go again .
you know , these planes are really turning me on .
get lost , sergei .
they say sex is best when bombs are falling .
honestly !
a guy from sarajevo told me .
it' s crazy .
you make love like it' s your last time ever .
and what did he say ?
who ?
ah , that guy .
he said he did it 6 times .
twice will do me .
masa .
damn you .
smile !
cheers .
you bombed belgrade ... ... in 1945 .
at easter .
and we were allies , friends .
yeah , yeah ...
what ?
you want something , someone ... ?
there isn' t anyone .
all the women are underground ... ... in the shelters .
6th aprll 1941
the germans bombed belgrade
thls is how belgrade looked in aprll 1941
fllmed by an amateur belgrade cameraman .
bosa !
listen to me .
you know what you have to do ?
i know .
first ring him .
i know .
on the telephone .
you know what to tell him ?
of course i do .
go on then , and don' t screw up .
when have i ever screwed up ?
when haven' t you ?
so ...
you must have the last word ...
that' s not true .
don' t you know there' s a war on ?
so what ?
look , bosa' s been injured .
it' s serious .
put on something decent .
we' ve got to go to her parents ' .
quick .
as if you' d have come with me any other way .
stop the car .
i' m getting out .
wait .
i remembered that film of yours last night ... ... the one you were thrown out of the academy for .
piss off .
man , that was an ingenious film .
what was the name of that young actress i screwed ?
milica ?
yeah , milica .
nice chick .
i heard she hanged herself after that .
that was your greatest film .
i realized then we' d work together on something big .
it was badly edited .
i didn' t like it .
thank god it was in black and white .
excellent story !
a romance between a german officer ... and a resistance girl in occupied belgrade .
yeah , it was really funny !
so , we' ve got an excellent story .
we' ve got the crew , the camera , the tape , we' ve got harvey .
and we' ve got war !
get it ?
he' s crazy .
he' s off his head .
i don' t give a damn .
go on , harvey .
you' re a real serb !
they' il arrest us all !
he' s ok .
he' il make a good actor .
maybe .
they' re all here .
we' ve got to hurry .
is this any way to begin a press conference ?
fucking hell .
what did he drink ?
tatula' s homemade shit .
ouch !
i told him just a drop .
come on , bosa .
guys .
i' il be doing the killing , jerk !
yesterday belgrade came under heavy bombardment .
our beloved country was attacked without mercy .
nineteen countries began an all out war ... ... against our oppressed nation .
that' s a lot !
i believe the time has come ... ... to rise up and defend our homeland .
for you , comrade tito .
tatula !
as you know we recently began filming our latest film ... ... ' chicken ' .
the people here before you now were at work yesterday ... ... when the enemy dropped its first bomb on our brave land .
they stayed at work , filming in the face of the enemy .
i don' t normally do this but i would ask for ... ... a warm round of applause for these brave souls .
bravo !
thank you .
thank you , heroes !
but whilst bombs fall , with us here , there' s an american ... ... brave enough to say a historical ' no ' ... to his president , his country , and their evil .
plus , he decided to invest his hard earned money ... from who knows what ... maybe the oil platforms ... in our film .
our serbian film !
the wartime love story of an american and a serbian girl .
what' s more , the american will star in it .
ladies and gentlemen ... ... i give you the one and only living american in belgrade ... ... mr. harvey jackson .
bravo !
bravo !
here we go again .
working without pay .
finally i' d like to mention a typically artistic gesture ... ... made by the old but enthusiastic tatula .
this brave soundman has told me today ...
he doesn' t want one cent for the film .
he said to me
' friend , take my pay and spend it the way you know best . '
now you see what serb film hands are made of !
bravo tatula !
bravo !
thank you everyone .
we' il take questions over cocktails downstairs .
tell everyone about this .
filming starts tomorrow .
long live art !
long live serbia !
congratulations !
thank you .
you' re a very cunning man .
the heavy artillery , a press conference , journalists , tv ... ... and all that to save a yankee , eh ?
no .
no ?
is it then to save his money , eh ?
because you need it for the film ?
well , there can' t be a film without money .
he spoke like the president .
what charisma !
you mean inside ?
there as well .
filmmaking during war is an unpredictable matter .
like penalties .
a lottery .
hi , i' m djole , director of photography .
irresistible djole !
we must use all our weapons .
including film .
i think you' ve underestimated its value up till now .
me ?
not you personally .
film is a powerful weapon .
take this press conference .
tonight it' il be shown all round the globe .
if you don' t want this crew though ...
the media war must be fought more seriously this time .
being humane is very important right now .
not only us film guys , but you television guys as well .
everyone .
everyone .
why all this patriotism ?
are you sick ?
why ?
you artists aren' t exactly the state' s best buddies .
it' s not you and us anymore .
the first bomb' s been dropped .
now we' re one .
clearly the whole thing has fermented ... ... and is more elaborate , structurally speaking .
the woman i play is the bravest creature i' ve known .
i haven' t got to know her yet , but i' m working on it .
it' s not easy .
she' s deep ... ... but that' s a greater challenge for us actresses .
it' s easy when there' s peace , but now when it' s ... shit happens ...
sorry , viewers !
thank you .
what ?
do you really think he can act ?
harvey ?
harvey' s amazing .
all americans can act .
two of their presidents were actors .
who was the second ?
oh yeah !
this one' s a musician .
he doesn' t look like an actor to me .
what does that matter ?
an actor doesn' t have to be handsome .
everything' s been worked out .
we just need a bit of money .
if you do as you say , that won' t be a problem .
dule , bullshit something !
i can' t do it all by myself .
yeah , right !
he' s never been in cinema .
fuck depleted uranium , depleted war ...
what are you looking at ?
i know there was a siren , lola .
i heard it .
i' m in a meeting .
i' il be 5 minutes .
how' s masa ?
3 minutes .
stay calm .
ok , 2 minutes ...
mlner' s hand are covered in blood
chlld crles in the war flame
you' re gone and so is your dress ,
wlll the sun ever shlne on us
a llttle vlolet dress , you were wearlng

what was that ?

no need to shit yourself from one bomb .
go on , play !
don' t screw around .
three , four .
a llttle vlolet dress , you were wearlng
when you went to klss hlm , and you were my true love
bravo , four eyes !
do you like the movies ?
i like sport as well .
your colleague' s ukrainian , eh ?
handsome guy .
we make a film , they bomb us , each to his own ...
but maybe we' il make a good film ...
i think sergei fucked up .
guys , i' ve n ... n ... never heard such crap .
no , the story' s ok , but where did they find this guy ?
first , he' s no actor , second he' s american .
never !
the yank' s better than lvana , isn' t he aca ?
a million times .
she' s such a bore .
how can you say that dule' s wife' s a whore ?
me ?
i didn' t .
shame on you .
you did , you did .
honestly i didn' t .
look !
good hit !
you' ve no chance .
we' il win .
serbia !
serbia !
hi , honey .
we' re home .
who' s ' we ' ?
harvey and i.
it' s just for a few days ... or a few months , i promise .
good evening , lola .
good evening , harvey .
good thing the whole crew didn' t come .
you' re an idiot .
bombs , sirens , i' m home alone with masa ... ... and you' re gallivanting around bars .
we were celebrating a bit .
today we began a new film .
so i saw .
it was on the state news .
the press conference ?
yeah .
you and dule looked great .
you should think about taking up politics .
put on a few kilos and you' il be perfect .
bye !
what' s up , sweetie ?
are you a bit scared ?
shall we frighten them off , masa ?
how , daddy , when i can' t see any of them ?
nor can i.
they can see us .
yeah , they can , the bastards .
put your hand like this .
shoo , stupid planes .
shoo , stupid planes .
again !
shoo , stupid planes .
that' s right .
why doesn' t harvey join in ?
he can' t .
he' s from their country .
they' ve gone , daddy .
you' re not scared anymore ?
no .
the theme' s forbidden love .
just like in my student film .
the same bombing .
just it' s an american instead of a german .
now , you hug not noticing the people gathering around you who have found out he' s an american .
then you start kissing ...
kissing harvey ?
yeah .
how ?
pretend or real ?
with tongues ?
pretend .
in front of all these ... ... people in the bomb shelter .
they want to lynch you but ...
god , dusan . ... the yank , who' s a total stranger somehow pulls out an
american flag ... and that' s the crux of the film .
why ?
because he burns it in front of everyone in the shelter .
to save himself and to show how much he loves you .
get it ?
well , ok .
they are already starting to smile .
you carry on kissing .
they begin to clap .
then they start chanting more and more loudly
' serbia , serbia ' .
he takes you in his arms ... ... and makes for the exit .
wow !
ugh , get lost !
it' s just like in ' officer and a gentleman ' , isn' t it ?
dule !
yeah ?
this flag burning' s great .
excellent stuff .
and harvey ?
what about him ?
what about him ? !
he has to burn his country' s flag .
who cares ?
he' s a bigger serb than the two of us .
will someone get that fucking phone !
just don' t expect the film to be big in america .
well , the blacks will watch it .
what do we care ?
hey , bosa , answer the phone !
fucking hell ...
what if we forget about burning the flag ... ... and they fuck under it instead ?
ivana and harvey ?
yeah .
you' il let lvana fuck that hulk ?
why not ?
lvana' s a professional .
it' s only film sex .
i know , but screwing in a shelter !
i don' t know ...
if i had it my way , i' d make the yank a totally good guy .
are you crazy ?
that' s why i say let' s forget politics .
we' il do an ordinary love story about two people ... ... going out in belgrade , screwing in the shelters .
no pictures to take of the war , nor of the bombing .
and finish the film with a shot of our execution !
listen .
don' t complicate things .
don' t dodge the bombing bit when it' s actually happening .
sergei , i' m out of here .
why do we need a s ... s ... set ?
take a camera , w ... w ... walk outside and ... ... there' s much better shots everywhere .
you don' t need me .
besides , i g ... g ... got called up .
i' ve got to make m ... m ... mock up planes at the airbase .
not you as well , aca !
what planes ?
unbelievable .
each evening ... 8 .
15 sharp .
you can set you w ... w ... watch by it .
they' re either stupid or ... ... they just keep dropping bombs on them .
off you go then , aca !
a bomb will hit you ... ... our guys will jump into bed with the yanks soon ... ... and you' il be six foot under .
fine , aca .
finish up and go .
how will we end the film ?
the war ends , and we ...
win ? !
ok , don' t fuck around .
who knows how this shit will end !
how will it end ?
they can' t just drop bombs on belgrade .
the world will rise up .
the russians , the chinese ...
don' t give a shit , sergei !
forget about the russians and the chinese .
they' il fuck us so hard , our eyes will pop out .
the story' s so imbecilic , it' il sell everywhere .
don' t be stupid and ruin our chances of big bucks .
ok , relax !
all i' m saying is add in some patriotic stuff .
the war ends and we' ve got a big film .
how do i look ?
ivana , we' re not filming " versace' s murder " .
this is a war film .
find something more suitable .
fine , and why are we going to screw in a bomb shelter ?
where do you want to screw him ?
in the hyatt hotel ?
we' re being bombed , for god' s sake !
so , what ?
i have to strip off in front of my neighbors ?
what' s he aiming at , sergei ?
a balkan romeo and juliet .
ahh , juliet .
how cute !
why didn' t you say so , dusan ?
dusan , get our friend harvey to burn the flag .
you can always cut it out after if you don' t like it ...
bosa , why are you messing around ?
look at him , like mccloud himself .
how i love this war !
senka !
her name' s senka !
shit , he' s bloody useless .
lie a bit , guys , else he' il walk out .
come on , bosa .
well done , harvey !
this is amazing .
once more , only without acting .
without acting ?
do you fancy a drive ?
maybe in some other life .
how about like this ?
don' t guys , he' s on our side .
he loves serbia .
that' s it .
great , honey !
come on , guys , let' s go .
while the iron' s hot .
we' il can it this time .

calm down , guys .
he' s on our side .
he loves serbia .
so why doesn' t he burn the flag ?
he doesn' t have to burn the flag .
we' il film a close up using someone else .
why shouldn' t he , dusan ?
yeah , why shouldn' t he ?
who the hell' s he ?
get out , now !
i' m in charge of the shelter .
what' s happening ?
no one said cut !
ok , guys .

it' s war .
we' re all a bit edgy .
he' d better burn the flag !
bloody traitor !
guys , this isn' t for real .
why can' t you see ?
he' s one of us .
he loves serbia .
serbia !

serbia !
serbia !
sergei , what now ?
teach him to act .
you managed with lvana .
fine .
that' s not a problem .
wood could act better though .
but they wanted to lynch us on day one .
it' il be the same every day .
it' il only last another couple of days .
that' s all we need .
that' s the last time i' m going to save this asshole .
what ? !
we should have let them beat him up ?
what if some black guys grabbed you to do you over ?
jackass !
you know , it' s war .
people are upset ... ... angry .
but , the sort of film i want to make ... ... won' t get past the government .
no way !
and without sponsor' s approval there is no money .
sponsors , my ass !
after what happened today , we are finished .
dusan !
what now , lvana ?
help me .
tell him i' m sorry .
yeah right !
i don' t give a damn .
well , he was good .
it' s obvious he' s got talent .
my prick is more talented !
maybe it' s better that they don' t deposit the money .
so , we save our asses . ... while we still can .
gentlemen !
i hear we' ve made a successful start .
what' s up , luvvies ?
what are you planning ?
it looks like the problem' s been solved for us .
give me a glass !
harvey !

what happened to your integrity and honesty ? ... you were fighting for truth .
and what are you doing now ?
what i' ve been doing my whole life .
i' m a filmmaker .
you sold your soul to them , sergei .
and for what ?
a few dollars , power , a medal .
what' s up with you , lola ?
i' m just trying to make a movie .
why' s that so bad ?
you' ve never been like th ...
shut up !

i need even more for it to be more realistic .
madam minister , if our film looked as beautiful as you ... ... we would do well .
let' s take it again .
hang on a second .
the minister of culture would like to say a few words .
quiet , bosa !
my dear artists !
bravo ! " .
thank you .
madam minister , could you repeat that for state tv ?
just make it a bit more attractive .
snow , rain , wind ... snow in april ?
at this time when the nation is suffering ...
then make the explosions louder .
i have just one word ...
so ... do we get money ... for licking the minister' s ass ?
shit , you communists only have money on the mind .
allow me !
it came to mind .
maybe ...
i don' t want to interfere ...
cut !
brilliant !
fucking hell !
he , that ...
american . ... could still be portrayed as a human being .
you know , after all we are all ...
of course .
for instance , we could ... ... have him save the child in this scene .
or these doctors .
you could ?
unbelievable .
amazing , truly amazing .
maybe though ... ... he should be killed at the end by his own people .
that would be a kind of justice .
it is war after all , isn' t it ?
that isn' t in the script ?
no , it isn' t .
cut !
stop the rain !
3 , 4 , end .
stop the rain .
excellent .
djole ?
it' s good for me .
that' s a wrap .
you don' t w ... w ... want your beans ?
no .

you should feed yourself up so we can win the war .
if only they' d g ... g ... go below 5000 meters .
don' t give me that war shit .
it' s the same for us all .
only i' m not fucking around .
i' m working ...

i' m just trying it .

look , american .
so much for your invisible plane .
we shat on it .
now it' s visible .
little shit .
it' s alright for them to take it away ... ... but when the people want it back ...
what' s up , bosiljka ?
i just want to try it .
go on then , try it .
they' re done for !
how did they hit it if they couldn' t see it ?
military secret .

fuckers !
hey , what are you doing tonight ?
thank god , you' ve finally remembered !
ten o' clock , yeah ?
but where ?
djole , come here .
they' re spending a lot .

i don' t believe this .
everyone' s in the shelter , and we' re on the terrace .
we' re watching war live out in the fresh air .
hi , bosa !
where are you off to ?
for some wine .
i drink and drink , but i can' t get drunk .
hang on , where' ve you been ?
what ?
where' ve you been ?
with a ... young female colleague .
checking some lenses ...
good evening , buddy .
evening , djole .
i' ve something serious to ask you .
have you bedded that camerawoman yet ?
get away ...
so you haven' t .
she' s not that kind of girl .
so you have .
we went out together for the first time today .
what does it matter how many times ?
it' s war .
when i can look after her , i can .
if i' m filming , i can' t .
hey , does this go ?
where' s masa ?
she' s downstairs in the shelter with the other kids .
they love it down there at the moment .
ah , so the kids are doing ok , eh ?
you think so , eh ?
ok , so what' s wrong now ?
nothing .
i didn' t know my kid would grow up in a shelter .
so ?
our parents did too , and they were ok .
they were missing half a brain to have made a country like this .
oh , lola ...
don' t complain !
i' m killing myself making a film about you , and your ...
i' m sorry , and how does that film end ?
what happens to that brave doctor ?
that' s not in the script .
we haven' t decided yet .
you mean you' re negotiating with the cop over the ending .
look , sergei .
if you want the film to be truthful ... ... and that woman really to be like me , then you can write ... write that the doctor packs her bags ... ... and leaves for germany with her daughter .
sorry , what are you talking about ?
fade to black ... the end .
they' re pounding us tonight .
i' m heading s ... s ... south tomorrow .
i swear i' il get even .
again ?
after parading around in that uniform for 10 days !
if you' re going , go !
you might be joking , tatula , but i' m serious .
i' m off tomorrow .
go then , man .
you want me to i ...
i ... leave now , huh ?
why don' t you ?
now ?
now , now !
what the fuck' s wrong with you , eh ?
go now !
you' il go when it' s all over .
it' s too late then .
don' t you believe me ?
not a word .
here , look !
what is it ?
my draft letter .
kosovo .
happy now ?
you' re worse than them up there .
what' s up ?
nothing ...
aca' s ...
shut up !
going to kosovo .
idiot .
hey , mileta ...
wiggle that ass .
how long' s this shit going to last ?
until we win .
in the film we' re winning ; that' s all that matters .
now you' il see how we catch spies !
come here , spy !
mileta , look at this , eh ! ?
go on , bosa ?
hang on !
quiet !
when ?
ok .
aca' s going to kosovo .
give him leave for 2 weeks , please .
you can easily make a
mlg , but try making a film in 2 weeks !
go on !
i can' t .
not a hope in hell ... he can have 2 days .
come on , go and pack .
stop it , mileta .
why do you want me to come back when i don' t want to ?
how can i look people in the eyes ?
they' re in k ...
k ... osovo and i' m on the s ... s ... set .
forget kosovo !
we' ve got to finish the film .
besides bosa' s crying non stop ...
bosa cries at cartoons .
two days .
come here , sergei .
two weeks .
hey , that' s not a bad idea .
what ?
that his own people kill him .
well done , aca .
look , now it hits the camera .
shame !
why ?
the acting was excellent .
what shall i write ?
this one' s the best .
the first and the third .
take the second one as well , bosa .
just in case .
44 8 take 1 .
that ' s enough smoke , aca .
the way you act , it ' s b ... b ... better we don ' t see !
why does it have to be him ?
can ' t it be someone else ?
no , it can ' t .
shut up , bitch !
let go of me !
i ' m not going to the army .
see , he says he ' s not going .
stop taking pictures , fatso !
well done , harvey !
cool !
well done !
i won ' t go to the army !
i won ' t !
i won ' t !
run then , bro !
he ' s an american .
don ' t lay a finger on him .
an american , eh ?
this is a classic !
don' t change anything .
cut !
excellent !
you can belt him even harder , just mind the set .
look what you did to him !
the camera ' s still running .
you ' re wasting tape .
hungover , eh , mile ?
i thought you were a good guy ... ... wanting to help his country .
you' re just a bunch of assholes making films with other people' s money , telling the world the worst lies about your nation .
you' re artists and think you' re entitled to do it .
i hate the movie ... ... and you disgust me !
wait .
it' s not like that .
shut up when i' m talking .
what' s the problem ?
you don' t know , eh ?
don' t play the innocent .
the nation' s being destroyed , children are dying , blood' s being shed .
the world' s competing to see who can harm us most and you lot are fucking around .
what' s the matter , luvvie ?
you don' t like the movie ?
no .
i just thought there' s some misunderstanding , so ...
there' s no misunderstanding .
it' s all as clear as day .
only this isn' t the film we wanted , it' s a mockery .
there are many different ways of making a patriotic film .
i can' t make a film with evil americans and good serbs .
yet you can make love scenes with the yank and our doctor .
this is the greatest tragedy your nation has ever seen and you don' t give a damn .
what makes you so scared of offending the west ?
can' t a serb girl hate an american ? !
even when they are bombing us !
i' il teach you how to make a film ... ... how to hate your enemies and to love your country .
you don' t know who you' re dealing with .
sergei !
what' s happened , bosa ?
they' ve said the hospital' s been hit .
lola , where' s masa ?
take his pulse .
he' s lost a lot of blood .
well , where is she ?
masa , masa !
masa !
sergei , we' re leaving .
you' ve got 2 days to decide if you want to leave with us .
she' il never hear sirens again .
never .
does anyone want to tell me what' s happening ?
bosa , why' s that guy so pissed at us ?
and you , dusan , are you going to let him stop the shooting ?
when i' m doing the best role of my career .
good afternoon , everyone .
good afternoon .
sorry i' m late .
we' ve got to pull ourselves together .
what' s filmed is filmed , but we can' t carry on like that .
we can' t mess around while the country' s bleeding .
nobody' s messing around .
we are making a film , well i am .
why are you giving me a hard time ?
go on , tell us .
tell you what ?
if we film anything , it has to be the truth about the tragedy our people are suffering .
what truth , sergei ?
don' t give me that propaganda bullshit .
have we got to change the whole story ?
don' t screw me around !
we' re not changing anything .
everything stays as it is .
a love story .
only we' il be on location more .
we' il go outside , so we can see what they' re doing to us .
half the country' s been ruined .
we' il put in some authentic , true life shots .
authentic shots .
fine , and the story ?
what are we going to do with the characters ?
with harvey ?
harvey dies trying to save his true love .
ivana could die as well .
that' s up to you .
ivana can' t get killed .
shut up , lvana .
tell me , please , why harvey has to die ?
because i' m sick of us ass licking the americans .
nor do i want us all to look like traitorous pussies .
don' t give me all that shit about patriots and traitors .
i well know how you became a patriot .
your bollocks are on the line and you want us to save them .
well , fuck it !
i won' t direct that kind of film .
you do it , if you want to .
dule ...
better still , get that cop to direct it .
wait , dule ...
it' s ok , bosa .
kids !
kids !
when we began this film , things were different .
people are dying .
i agree .
let' s stop filming and wait till the war' s over .
what !
stop filming because of that idiot ...
what' s he saying ?
bravo , harvey !
if we stop filming , we' ve achieved nothing .
this way we still have a chance .
it' s all the s ... s ... same to me ...
i' m heading s ... s ... south ...
listen , dule .
i can get hold of some amazing authentic material .
my girl works on the state tv news , so don' t worry .
ok , djole .
go to the tv station and pick out the most dramatic stuff .
i need two days to sort out the script .
that' s that .
then we' re all agreed ?
i don' t get where we fucked up .
it was going so well .
we' re still filming .
we' ve still got a chance .
see ?
i think we' ve lost the plot though .
lost ?
what if the russians get involved ?
forget about the russians .
go on .
you laugh .
see you .
tatula ?
we' re off to the tv station to get some footage she found to surprise serge .
yeah , yeah !
no , honestly .
who gives a damn about the film right now ?
it takes balls to make a film while there' s a war on .
see you .
aca' s gone .
to kosovo ?
how can we make a film while bombs are falling ? " ... ... you once asked me .
it' s not just any old film .
it takes courage to make because it' s after the truth , without compromises , without ideology , without politics , without dreams of success , without donations , without money , without winners and losers decided in advance .
so ...
don' t overdo it , serge , " you told me .
of all of us , djole was the best .
his life was more truthful and more important ... ... than the search for truth ... ... than politics ... ... than the film itself .
and so today , we bury our film together with him .
dear djole ...
... may you rest in peace .
rest in peace .
are you sure we should go ?
i' m sure . ... more than 20 dead and serlously hurt journallsts
producers , asslstants and other members of technlcal
stuff .
parts of human bodles are found in church yard 300 meters away from state tv bulldlng .
daddy , there' s a cool zoo where mommy' s taking me .
there' s everything there , honey .
call as soon as you get there .
what about you ?
when will you come ?
i' ve explained everything to you .
you know everything .
wow , cool .
hold it !
bye , my love .
have you really let the crew go ?
yeah .
what ?
no more movie ?
let' s stop the games , mileta .
of course there' s no more movie .
a man died .
my friend .
a great guy .
do you know how many of my guys have lost their lives ?
all great guys .
have you any idea , eh ?
i know .
they' re soldiers .
real heroes .
we know how to make films about them ... ... about make believe death .
when it' s real though , we can' t handle it so well .
what can i say ?
i made a mistake .
my fault .
yours ?
i thought it was theirs , them with the bombs .
whatever .
the movie' s off .
there' s a lot of people interested in this movie .
i think it' s out of our hands now .
use your head .
this studio looks kind of sad without a crew .
go on , call them back and start filming again .
mileta !
see you some day when things get better .
whllst the majorlty of our natlon are bravely defendlng
the homeland , heads held hlgh splting the nato aggressor ,
certaln corrupt traltors succumb to the lure of
western capltal and the conformlst phllosophy .
on the pretext of maklng a movle ,
thls group of forelgn agents are taklng part in spylng ...
what' s this program ?
look , it' s you lot .
i never knew you were spies .
some new stars in our sky of spies .
now when you go outside , the nation will rip you apart in their adoration .
you know that' s not true .
it' s on tv .
but you know it' s not the truth .
as far as the public are concerned , it' s the truth .
you can explain to them after , that it' s not true ... ... there' s not much to say .
the man was susplcious from the outset .
there were the telephone calls to unbellev ...
it' s a tape .
i wanted to hear your professional opinions .
can this make the headlines ?
what did you think ?
the state pays you to fuck around ?
who' s for going back to work ?
i' m glad it' s unanimous .
well done .
you' re free to go .
tell the american the plot of our latest movie on your way .
thank you very much .
i don' t need you anymore .
stay away from the studio .
is that clear ?
go on , get lost !
dad , it ' s masa .
why aren ' t you answering the phone ?
we ' re in germany .
sergei ?
there ' s been no sign of you for days .
sergei , it ' s bosa .
if you can , please ... ... please ring ...
80 8 4
action !
stop !
stop !
it' s no good at all .
is it ... is it clear to you ?
harvey' s been killed by an american bomb .
his guys have killed him .
shaken , you take that flag and cover him .
touchingly .
and you with the camera go up , down and then in ... ... on a close up of those tears , to condemn the crime .
come on , you went to film school , didn' t you ?
come on .
sergej , it ' s dule .
i must see you urgently .
urgently .
you' re crazy coming to the set in that car .
mileta will suss us out straight away .
he' s crazy .
do you know we' re not allowed to mention your name on set ?
careful , careful .
shut up , if he sees us here , he' il kill us .
we do as he tells us .
he is directing us now .
do you know mileta wants to blow up harvey ?
give over .
we have to go to the airport to film them hitting mock ups .
he wants to tie him to a plane with a ton of explosives , to blow him to kingdom come .
i can' t believe what i' ve got into .
at the end of filming , he' il shoot us all .
we know too much .
he told me this was the war against the whole orthodox world .
sergei , brother , save us .
otherwise we' re all collateral damage .
and don' t tell anyone about this .
bye .
there ' s been no sign of you for days .
sergei , it ' s bosa .
if you can , please ... please ring .
we ' ve got news about aca .
bye .
bosa , if i w ... w ... were to go again , would you see me off ?
you know , when a soldier g ... g ... goes to the army ... ... and his mother prepares ... you c ... c ... could ... ... not like a mother , but like someone c ... c ... close .
i don' t mean close like a g ... g ... girlfriend ... ... just like a f ... f ... friend .
there' s 5 minutes of tape .
give it back in the morning .
i had trouble getting mileta to take the day off .
ok .
don' t worry , it' s all under control .
you know where to pick it up tomorrow .
ok , see you .
sergei .
what are you up to ?
i never ask you where you' re going ... ... but you always tell me .
and now you won' t tell me .
don' t think i' m asking you where you' re going , but ...
wait !
oh , fucking hell ...
what' s up , bosiljka ?
didn' t i tell you everything was under control ?
don' t be like that now .
trust me .
take care that you don' t ...
that i don' t screw up , huh ?
you have to have the last word .
no , i don' t .
everything' s going to be blown up .
any second now .
it' il all be gone in 20 minutes .
or even 10 .
come on , love .
find me those negatives and hurry off home .
i' ve got to ring mileta .
guys , don' t do that .
i shouldn' t be telling you this , but ok .
mileta' s gone to church .
and you know what that means ?
do you want to tell me where you' re taking him ?
to the military hospital .
but i must call mileta .
on whose orders ?
on his own .
go on then , ring him .
on your own head be it .
tell him everything i said .
go on , ring him .
i have to .
you have to ?
look , i' ve got to go .
don' t worry , they won' t bomb you .
why would they want to hit a film lab ?
bye !
this is a four star hotel .
all our food is all checked .
stars ? !
poison is more likely !
he nearly died .
well what do you fucking want ?
bravo .
success .
bye harvey .
sell the flat , half of it goes into this account in germany ; to my wife and the rest to my secretary .
bosa ?
yeah , she' s the one .
they' il need money for the film .
is the tape machine ready ?
what tape machine ?
yours .
you want my tape machine ?
i' il look after it , don' t worry .
you know what it' s been through ?
i know , all the war films .
bosa will bring it back tomorrow .
did you hear that milosevic would sign peace agreement ?
i heard .
nice town , isn' t it ?
yeah , beautiful .
it survived this war as well .
it' s just a shame i' il never come back here .
listen to him .
sergei got away from us .
like he' s left the country .
there' s no trace of him .
you lying bastard !
he' s worse than us !
he' s a greater liar than us !
what' s up ?
what do you mean he recorded his own death ?
what ?
how can a dead man film his own death ?
mileta , sir , just to let you know .
i told your guys to ... ... he stole your film ...
what press conference ?
there isn' t one .
i didn' t allow it .
listen !
get a team and arrest anything that moves .
but not before i give the sign .
this looks like a good spot to burn a film tonight .
and mileta can ' t put this fire out .
mileta ' s a silly little policeman shit .
to be or not to be , that is the question , i do believe .
i hope the american bustards are on time this evening .
mileta , this is your film .
it ' s coming with me .
only angels will be able to watch it .
but i don ' t think even they ' il want to .
bye .
dule , listen to me .
this should be the last scene of a film you must shoot about djole , aca , me and our stupid lives .
you ' ve got everything the story , war , laughter , politics , emotions , and a good ending .
with a victor who gets killed in front of cameras .
just don ' t be sentimental , dule .
and bosa , don ' t cry .
i ' ve gotta go .
it ' il be your greatest film .
thank you all for coming in such great numbers .
we were seeing pictures of tragic dead of our friend .
our enemies say they have intelligent bombs that strike only selected targets .
this time they selected well .
