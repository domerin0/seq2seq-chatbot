so that' s a texas funeral ?
yep .
i have to give it to ya , budd .
that' s a pretty fucked up way to die .
what' s the name on the grave she' s buried under ?
paula ... ... schultz .
can i look at the sword ?
that' s my money right there in that red bag , isn' t it ?
it sure is .
well then , it' s your sword now .
what' s that you said ?
so this is a hattori hanzo sword ?
that' s a hanzo sword , all right .
bill tells me you once had one of these of your own .
yeah , once .
yeah ?
how does this one compare to that ?
if you' re gonna compare a hanzo sword ... ... you compare it to every other sword ever made wasn' t made by hattori hanzo .
here you go .
wrap your lips around that .
so ... ... which " r " are you filled with ?
what ?
they say ... ... the number one killer ... ... of old people ... ... is retirement .
people got a job to do , they tend to live a little bit longer so they can do it .
i' ve always figured that ... ... warriors and their enemies ... ... share the same relationship .
so now that you' re not gonna have to face your enemy no more on the battlefield ... ... which " r " ya filled with ?
relief ... ... or regret ?
a little bit of both .
horseshit .
i' m sure you do feel a little bit of both .
but i know damn well that you feel one ... ... more than you feel the other .
which one is it ?
regret .
you know , you gotta hand it to the ol ' girl .
i never saw anybody buffalo bill the way she buffaloed bill .
bill thought she was so damn smart .
and i tried to tell him ... ... she was just smart for a blond .
thanks a bunch .
all right .
mmm .
i' m sorry , budd .
that was rude of me , wasn' t it ?
budd , i' d like to introduce my friend , the black mamba .
black mamba , this is budd .
you know , before i picked that little fella up ,
i looked him up on the internet .
fascinating creature , the black mamba .
in africa , the saying goes ,
' in the bush , an elephant can kill you , a leopard can kill you ,
' and a black mamba can kill you .
but only with the mamba ,
and this has been true in africa since the dawn of time , is death sure . '
hence its handle , ' death incarnate . " ' pretty cool , huh ?
lts neurotoxic venom is one of nature' s most effective poisons ,
acting on the nervous system , causing paralysis .
the venom of a black mamba can kill a human being in four hours
if , say , bitten on the ankle or the thumb .
however , a bite to the face or torso can bring death from paralysis within 20 minutes .
now , you should listen to this , ' cause this concerns you .
the amount of venom that can be delivered from a single bite can be gargantuan .
you know , i' ve always liked that word , " gargantuan .
i so rarely have an opportunity to use it in a sentence .
if not treated quickly with antivenom ,
ten to 15 milligrams can be fatal to human beings .
however , the black mamba can deliver as much as 100 to 400 milligrams of venom from a single bite .
now ... ... in these last agonizing minutes of life you have left ,
let me answer that question you asked earlier more thoroughly .
right at this moment ... ... the biggest " r " i feel is regret .
regret that maybe the greatest warrior i have ever met met her end at the hands of a bushwhackin ' , scrub , alkie , piece of shit like you .
that woman deserved better .
bill ... ... i have some tragic news .
your brother' s dead .
i am so sorry , baby .
she put a black mamba in his camper .
i got her , sweetie .
she' s dead .
you ever start feeling sentimental , go to barstow , california .
when you get here , walk into a florist and buy a bunch of flowers .
then you take those flowers to huntington cemetery on fuller and guadalupe , look for the headstone marked " paula schultz , " and lay them on the grave .
' cause you will be standing at the final resting place of beatrix kiddo .
marty kitrosser ?
here .
melanie harrhouse ?
here .
beatrix kiddo ?
here .
look ...
i can be there in about four hours .
do you want me to come over ?
no , no , no , no .
you need me , baby , i' m there .
ok .
i' m leaving now .
you go smoke some pot or somethin ' , i' il be there soon .
ugh .
gross .
hi ya !
to my brother , budd .
the only man i ever loved .
bill .
what' s that ?
budd' s hanzo sword .
he said he pawned it .
guess that makes him a liar now , don' t it ?
elle ?
bea .
somethin ' i' ve always been curious about .
just between us girls ... ... what did you say to pai mei to make him snatch out your eye ?
ow !
i called him a miserable old fool .
ooh .
bad idea .
know what i did ?
i killed that miserable old fool .
how do you like the fish head , you miserable old fool ?
i poisoned his fish heads .
elle , you treacherous dog .
i give you my word ...
and i told him ,
to me , the word of an old fool like you is worth less than nothing .
that' s right .
i killed your master .
and now i' m gonna kill you , too .
with your own sword , no less .
which , in the very immediate future , will become my sword .
bitch ... ... you don' t have a future .
fucking bitch !
fucking bitch !
i' il kill you !
you' re fuckin ' dead !
you bitch !
you bitch !
i' il fucking kill you , you bitch !
oh , i' il get you !
i' m gonna ...
where are you ?
lemme fuckin ' at you !
where are you ?
i' m coming , you fucking bitch !
you' re fucking dead !
you' re dead !
oh ... shit !
like most men who never knew their father ,
bill collected father figures .
the first was esteban vihaio .
esteban was a pimp and a friend of bill' s mother .
he ran a brothel in acuna , mexico for over 50 years .
his army , the acuna boys , made up of the fatherless offspring of his whores , ran acuna .
he ran the acuna boys .
now , at the age of 80 , it would be this retired gentleman of leisure who could point me in bill' s direction .
seor esteban vihaio ?
yes .
may i join you ?
only on the condition that you call me esteban .
may i join you , esteban ?
please .
americana ?
yes .
i speak a little spanish , if you prefer .
no , no , no , no .
i prefer english .
i haven' t spoken it in a while , but i would relish the opportunity to converse with such a pretty companion as yourself .
it' s my pleasure to be in the company of such a fine gentleman as yourself .
i must warn you , young lady ... ... i am susceptible to flattery .
how may i be of service to you ?
where' s bill ?
ahh .
you must be beatrix .
i can see the attraction .
i remember when bill was only five years old , i took him to the movies .
it was a movie starring lana turner .
the postman always ring twice , with john garfields .
and whenever she would appear on the screen ,
bill would begin compulsively to suck his thumb to an obscene amount .
and i knew from this very moment , this boy was a fool for blonds .
mmm .
you know ... ... being a fool for a woman such as yourself ... ... is always the right thing to do .
if we had met when i was back in business ... ... you would have been my number one lady .
well , i' m flattered .
you goddamn well better be .
this ...
i heard you were driving a truck .
my pussy wagon died on me .
the pussy died .
hmm .
bill shot you in the head , no ?
yes .
hmm .
i would have been much nicer .
i would have just cut your face .
you must forgive me .
please ... you have a drink with me .
clara !
coming .
dos aejo .
gracias .
what were we talking about ?
bill .
where' s bill ?
where' s bill .
yeah .
hmm .
bill is at the villa quatro , on the road to salina .
i will draw you a map .
bill is like a son to me .
do you know why i help you ?
no .
because he would want me to .
now , that i don' t believe .
ahh .
how else is he ever going to see you again ?
freeze , mommy .
bang , bang !
oh !
oh !
she got us , b. b.
mommy got us .
oh , i' m dying !
i' m dying .
fall down , sweetheart .
mommy shot us .
but little did quickdraw kiddo know that little b. b. was only playing possum , due to the fact that she was impervious to bullets .
i am pervious to bullets , mommy .
hey , get back down there .
you' re playing possum .
so , as the smirking killer advanced on what she thought was a bullet ridden corpse , that' s when little b. b. fired .
bang , bang !
you' re dead , mommy .
so die .
oh !
b. b.
oh !
b. b ...
i should' ve known .
you are ... the best .
oh , mommy .
don' t die .
i was just playing .
i know .
i told her that you were asleep ... ... but that one day you' d wake up and come back to her .
and she asked me , " if mommy' s been asleep since i was born , then how will she know what i look like ?
to which i replied , " because mommy' s been dreaming of you .
that' s what i said .
did you dream of me ?
i dreamed of you .
every single night , baby .
every single night .
i waited a long time for you to wake up , mommy .
now , let me look at you .
oh .
my , my , my , what a pretty little girl you are .
you' re pretty too , mommy .
tell mommy what you said when i showed you her picture .
mnh mnh .
come on , shy girl .
mnh mnh .
come on .
you know what you said .
come on .
tell mommy .
it' il make her feel good .
come on .
mnh mnh .
yeah .
come on .
i said ...
i said ,
you' re the most beautifulest woman i ever saw in the whole wide world .
that' s the truth .
that' s what she said .
b. b. , don' t you think mommy has the prettiest hair in the whole wide world ?
yes , i do .
matter of fact , it' s better than pretty .
what' s better than pretty ?
mmm ...
gorgeous .
very good .
gorgeous .
mommy is gorgeous .
hmm .
you know , sweetie , mommy' s kinda mad at daddy .
why , daddy ?
were you being a bad daddy ?
i' m afraid i was .
i was a real bad daddy .
our little girl learned about life and death the other day .
wanna tell mommy about what happened to emilio ?
i killed him .
emilio was her goldfish .
emilio was my goldfiss .
she came running into my room , holding the fish in her hand and crying ,
daddy .
daddy .
emilio' s dead .
and i said , " really ?
that' s so sad .
how did he die ?
and what did you say ?
i stepped on him .
actually , young lady , the words you so strategically used were ,
i accidentally stepped on him .
to which i queried ,
and just how did your foot accidentally find its way into emilio' s fishbowl ?
and she said , " no , no , no .
emilio was on the carpet when i stepped on him .
mmm .
the plot thickens .
and just how did emilio get on the carpet ?
and mommy , you would' ve been so proud of her .
she didn' t lie .
she said she took emilio out of his bowl ... ... and put him on the carpet .
and what was emilio doing on the carpet ?
flapping .
and then you stomped on him .
uh huh .
and when you lifted up your foot ... ... what was emilio doing then ?
nothing .
he stopped flapping , didn' t he ?
she told me later ... ... that the second she lifted up her foot and saw emilio not flapping , she knew what she had done .
is that not the perfect visual image of life and death ?
a fish flapping on the carpet , and a fish not flapping on the carpet .
so powerful , even a four year old with no concept of life or death ... ... knew what it meant .
you loved emilio , didn' t you ?
uh huh .
well ...
i love mommy , too .
but i did to mommy what you did to emilio .
you stomped on mommy ?
worse .
i shot mommy .
not pretend shooting like we were just doing .
i shot her for real .
why ?
did you want to see what would happen ?
no , i knew what would happen to mommy if i shot her .
what i didn' t know was , when i shot mommy , what would happen to me .
what happened ?
i was very sad .
and that' s when i learned ... ... some things , once you do , they can never be undone .
what happened to mommy ?
why don' t you ask mommy ?
you ok , mommy ?
did it hurt ?
no , sweetie .
doesn' t hurt anymore .
did it make you sick ?
no .
it made me sleep .
that' s why i haven' t been with you , b. b. i' ve been asleep .
but you' re awake now , mommy .
right ?
i' m wide awake , pretty girl .
b. b. , would you like mommy to watch a video with you before sleepy time ?
uh huh .
mommy , do you wanna watch a video with me before sleepy time ?
oh , yeah !
i would love to .
which one do you wanna watch ?
shogun assassin .
no , b. b. shogun assassin is too long .
mnh mnh .
no , it' s not .
well , then , i' il leave you ladies to it .
when i was little , my father was famous .
he was the greatest samurai in the empire .
and he was the shogun' s decapitator .
he cut off the heads of 131 lords .
my father would come home to mother and when he would see her , he would forget about the killings .
he wasn' t scared of the shogun , but the shogun was scared of him .
maybe that was the problem .
one night , the shogun sent ...
my man got a heart
like the rock that' s in the sea
well , no one told me about her
the way she lied
well , no one told me about her
how many people cried
my man got a heart
like the rock that' s in the sea
my man got a heart
like the rock that' s in the sea
well , no one told me about her
the way she lied
well , no one told me about her
how many people cried
but it' s too late to say you' re sorry
how would i know ?
why should i care ?
please don' t bother trying to find her
she' s not there
i was just admiring your sword .
quite a piece of work .
speaking of which , how is hanzo san ?
he' s good .
has his sushi gotten any better ?
you know , i couldn' t believe it .
you got him to make you a sword .
it was easy .
i just dropped your name , bill .
that' d do it .
well , no one told me about her
well , no one told me about her
i suppose the idea is we cross hanzo swords .
am i right ?
well , it just so happens this hacienda has its own private beach .
and that private beach just so happens to look particularly beautiful bathed in moonlight .
and there just so happens to be a full moon out tonight .
so , swordfighter , if you want a swordfight , that' s where i suggest .
but if you wanna be old school about it ... ... and you know i' m all about old school ... ... then we could wait until dawn and slice each other up at sunrise
like a couple of real life honest ...
now , if you don' t settle down , i' m gonna have to put one in your kneecap .
and i hear tell that' s a very painful place to get shot in .
i' m just fuckin ' with you .
now ... ... when it comes to you ... ... and us ... ... i have a few unanswered questions .
so , before this tale of bloody revenge reaches its climax ,
i' m gonna ask you some questions , and i want you to tell me the truth .
however , therein lies a dilemma .
because when it comes to the subject of me ,
i believe you are truly and utterly incapable of telling the truth .
especially to me .
and least of all , to yourself .
and when it comes to the subject of me ,
i am truly and utterly incapable of believing anything you say .
how do you suppose we solve this dilemma ?
well , it just so happens ,
i have a solution .
aah !
gotcha !
goddamn !
what the fuck did you just shoot me with ?
my greatest invention .
or at least my favorite .
don' t touch it , or i' il stick another one right in your cheek .
what lies within that dart , just begging to course its way through your veins ... ... is an incredibly potent and quite infallible truth serum .
i call it " the undisputed truth .
twice as strong as sodium pentothal , with no druggie aftereffects .
except for a slight wave of euphoria .
you feel it ?
euphoria ?
yeah .
no .
too bad .
as you know ... ... i' m quite keen on comic books .
especially the ones about superheroes .
i find the whole mythology surrounding superheroes fascinating .
take my favorite superhero , superman .
not a great comic book .
not particularly well drawn .
mmm .
but the mythology ...
the mythology is not only great , it' s unique .
how long does this shit take to go into effect ?
about two minutes .
just long enough for me to finish my point .
now , a staple of the superhero mythology is , there' s the superhero and there' s the alter ego .
batman is actually bruce wayne , spider man is actually peter parker .
when that character wakes up in the morning , he' s peter parker .
he has to put on a costume to become spider man .
and it is in that characteristic superman stands alone .
superman didn' t become superman .
superman was born superman .
when superman wakes up in the morning , he' s superman .
his alter ego is clark kent .
his outfit with the big red " s " that' s the blanket he was wrapped in as a baby when the kents found him .
those are his clothes .
what kent wears the glasses , the business suit that' s the costume .
that' s the costume superman wears to blend in with us .
clark kent is how superman views us .
and what are the characteristics of clark kent ?
he' s weak ... ... he' s unsure of himself ... ... he' s a coward .
clark kent is superman' s critique on the whole human race .
sorta like beatrix kiddo and mrs. tommy plimpton .
aso .
the point emerges .
you would' ve worn the costume of arlene plimpton .
but you were born beatrix kiddo .
and every morning when you woke up , you' d still be beatrix kiddo .
oh , you can ... take the needle out .
are you calling me a superhero ?
i' m calling you a killer .
a natural born killer .
you always have been , and you always will be .
moving to el paso ... ... working in a used record store ... ... goin ' to the movies with tommy ... ... clipping coupons .
that' s you ... ... trying to disguise yourself as a worker bee .
that' s you tryin ' to blend in with the hive .
but you' re not a worker bee .
you' re a renegade killer bee .
and no matter how much beer you drank or barbecue you ate or how fat your ass got , nothing in the world would ever change that .
did you really think your life in el paso was gonna work ?
no !
but i would' ve had b. b. !
don' t get me wrong .
i think you would have been a wonderful mother .
but you are a killer .
all those people you killed to get to me ... ... felt damn good , didn' t they ?
yes .
every single one of them ?
yes .
that was the warmup round .
now comes the $64, 000 question .
why did you run away from me with my baby ?
do you remember the last assignment you sent me on ?
of course .
lisa wong .
the morning i left , i was sick .
on the plane , i threw up .
maybe i was pregnant .
easy to use .
remove cap and urinate on the absorbent end for five seconds .
accurate results in only 90 seconds .
you can read the results as soon as the line appears in the window .
fuck .
what i didn' t know ... ... was that somewhere on my journey i had been spotted .
with me in l. a. , it didn' t take lisa wong long to send an assassin of her own .
hello , can i help you ?
hello , i' m karen kim .
i' m the hospitality manager of the hotel .
i have a welcome gift from the management .
oh , that' s nice .
um ...
can you just leave it by the door ?
you pretty good with that shotgun ?
not that i have to be at this range , but i' m a fuckin ' surgeon with this shotgun .
well , guess what , bitch ?
i' m better than annie oakley .
and i got you right in my sight .
i could blow your fuckin ' head off .
not before i put one right between your eyes , so let' s talk .
karen ... ... i just found out ... ... right now ... ... not a moment before you blew a hole through the door ... ... that i' m pregnant .
what is this ?
on the floor by the door ... ... is a strip that says i' m pregnant .
bullshit .
any other time you' d be 100 percent right .
this time ... ... you' re 100 percent wrong .
i' m the deadliest woman in the world .
but right now ... ... i' m just scared shitless for my baby .
please .
just look at the strip .
please .
stay where you are and don' t move .
i don' t know what this fuckin ' shit means .
the box with the directions it' s right there .
easy to use .
remove the cap and urinate on the absorbent end .
blue means pregnant .
i' il read it myself , thank you .
oh , ok .
say i were to believe you .
what then ?
just go home .
i' il do the same .
congratulations .
before that strip turned blue ... ... i was a woman , i was your woman .
i was a killer who killed for you .
before that strip turned blue , i would' ve jumped a motorcycle onto a speeding train .
for you .
but once that strip turned blue ... ... i could no longer do any of those things .
not anymore .
because i was gonna be a mother .
can you understand that ?
yes .
but why didn' t you ... ... tell me then , instead of now ?
once you knew , you' d claim her .
and i didn' t want that .
not your decision to make .
yes .
but it' s the right decision , and i made it for my daughter .
she deserved to be born with a clean slate .
but with you ... ... she would' ve been born into a world she shouldn' t have .
i had to choose .
i chose her .
you know , five years ago , if i had to make a list of impossible things that could never happen , you performing a coup de grce on me by bustin ' a cap in my crown ... ... would' ve been right at the top of the list .
i' d have been wrong , wouldn' t i ?
i i' m sorry .
was that a question ?
of impossible things that could never happen yes , in this instance , you would' ve been wrong .
well ?
when you never came back ,
i naturally assumed lisa wong , or somebody else , had killed you .
oh !
and for the record ... ... letting somebody think somebody they love is dead when they' re not is quite cruel .
i mourned you for three months .
and in the third month of mourning you ... ... i tracked you down .
i wasn' t tryin ' to track you down .
i was tryin ' to track down the fucking assholes i thought killed you .
so i find you ... ... and what do i find ?
not only are you not dead ... ... you' re getting married to some fucking jerk .
and you' re pregnant .
i overreacted .
you overreacted ?
is that your explanation ?
i didn' t say i was gonna explain myself .
i said i was gonna tell you the truth .
but if that' s too cryptic , let' s get literal .
i' m a killer .
i' m a murdering bastard .
you know that .
and there are consequences ... ... to breaking the heart of a murdering bastard .
you experienced some of them .
was my reaction really that surprising ?
yes .
it was .
could you do what you did ?
of course you could .
but i never thought you would , or could , do that to me .
i' m really sorry , kiddo ... ... but you thought wrong .
you and i have unfinished business .
baby ... you ain' t kiddin ' .
pai mei taught you the five point palm exploding heart technique ?
' course he did .
why didn' t you tell me ?
i don' t know .
because i' m ... ... a bad person .
no .
you' re not a bad person .
you' re a terrific person .
you' re my favorite person .
but every once in a while ... ... you can be a real cunt .
how do i look ?
you look ready .
well , well , well .
if it ain' t the little flower .
good evening , mr. and mrs. america and all the ships at sea .
let' s go to press .
flash .
do you have a magpie in your home ?
if you do , you are most fortunate .
the magpie is the most charming bird in all the world .
he is the best friend a farmer ever had .
treat him gently .
treat him kindly .
and always remember , the magpie deserves your respect .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
oh , thank you .
