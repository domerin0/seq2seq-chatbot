season 5 episode 9 the sting
joke0 [ kittensgivegas@ caramail . com ]
a hush comes over the crowd .
the only sound is bender calling everyone else a jerk as he swings !
and he slices it ... into the water , duh !
man !
bad news , everyone !
you' re not good enough to go on your next mission .
not good enough !
why ?
says who !
because !
and says me !
it' s an extremely dangerous mission that killed my last crew .
and you' re not nearly as good as them .
we live to suck an another day !
we are just as good as any others crews you sent to their deaths .
what' s the mission ?
collectiong honey .
ordinary honey .
that doesn' t sound so dangerous .
this is no ordinary honey !
it' s produced by vicious spaces bees .
a single sting of their hideous neurotoxin can cause instant death !
and that' s if you' re not allergic !
you don' t wanna know what happens then oh no no , god no !
your insides will boil out of your eye sockets like a science fair volcano !
i didn' t want to know !
these bees are larger than most buicks ! and twice as ugly .
larger than an american sedan ?
how big is the honeycomb ?
honeycomb' s big .
yeah , yeah , yeah !
it' s not small ?
no , no , no .
it don' t take more than deadly deadly bees to keep us from doing our job .
come on , boys !
but leela , we' re no good !
listen , i' m scared too .
but i' m more scared of disappointing myself .
i' m not scared of that at all !
now , bees communicate by dancing .
like my parents !
wait !
that was hitting !
so the language cartridge will let you distract them .
ah good !
i often have toughts and feelings that can only be expressed through dance !
bender !
quick !
waggle something !
leela , let' s turn back , there' s absolutly no shame in wussing out .
relax .
everything will be fine .
oh my god !
the old planet express ship .
there' s the blackbox . captain , the bees have us surrounded .  the professor was right .
we' re not as good as his old crew .  well i aim to proove him wrong .
it' il take more than a few deadly deadly bees to ...
couldn' t make that out .
too much static !
we found it !
the honeycomb hide out !
hey , what' s this goop ?
royal jelly .
they feed it to the queen .
bees made honey and jelly ?
how come nothing humans make taste good ?
help !
i can' t swim in jelly as far as i know !
look !
it' s a baby queen .
she' s so cute !
you adorable wittle itty bitty fuzzy wuzzy ...
leela , stop bonding and let' s go !
i got jelly in my underpants !
i' m taking this bee with us .
with a queen we can build a hive and make more honey ourselves .
let me just pack her a lunch and we' il go .
pick up the pace lady !
i didn' t mean you' re all fat .
it' s just fatso there .
this is where we' re distinguishing ourselves from the last crew .
activate emergency high speed self contained escape pack crisis response unit .
quick !
good luck , bender !
i' m back , baby .
we made it , we' re alive !
burn out that old crew !
the only things they did better than us were suck and die .
leela , we got lucky this time , but you should be more careful .
i don' t want anything to happen to you .
thanks , but i can look out for myself .
frankly , i can smell danger a mile away .
look out !
you want her ?
you' il have to go through me !
you call that a wound ?
that' s a boo boo tops !
but thanks for trying to save me , fry !
he' s ...
he' s dead !
who will make bender waffles just the way he likes them now ?
it was all my fault !
he died because of me !
no , no , no ...
i' m lying to make her feel better !
husband , can' t you go anywhere without lighting something up ?
it' s an old jamaican accounting tradition .
we burn his timecard .
that way , his zombie doesn' t come back looking for his final paycheque .
he looks so natural .
it' s funny to think he' s crammed full of sawdust and preservatives .
i only wish i could' ve removed the stinger .
i barely knew philip , but as a clergyman i have no problems telling his most intimate friends all about him .
soothe us with sweet lies .
it may comfort you to know fry' s death took only 15 seconds .
yet the pain was so intense that it felt to him like 15 years .
and it goes without saying , it caused him to empty his bowels .
we now commend fry' s body to the ages .
he' s walking on sunshine now .
this makes me the oldest member of my family .
him do good snoo snoo .
all those times , i said " kill all humans " ,
i' d always whisper " expect one " .
fry was that one ... and i never told him so .
farewell from the world of tomorrow !
they say a spoonful of space honey helps ease the pain .
it' s good !
i feel funny .
how funny !
i tought you were dead .
no , i' m better than ever .
before the accident , i couldn' t do this !
impressive .
but it does sort a support my you are dead theory .
i will proove i' m alive , by telling you something only i could know .
there is a surprise for you in my locker .
i got it at swedish novelty shop before he left .
it' s too beautiful to open .
can i open it ?
sure .
there is only one thing i want you to do .
what ?
i want you to wake up .
wake up ?
but i' m not ...
in my dream , fry said he hid a gift from me in his locker .
if it' s true , then he must still exist in some form .
of course he still exists .
as a frozen corpse in outer space !
i made myself sad .
well , here goes .
bupkis !
well , i feel better now .
pawning all this stuff in fry' s locker helped give me closure .
was there anything in there that might have been a gift for me ?
no .
nothing .
not at all .
no way jose !
here it is .
you took this from fry' s locker ! ?
hey , the guy' s dead .
there' s no law against grave robbing !
that proves it .
fry is alive somewhere , and he' s reaching me in my dreams .
bullpies !
lay down here and we' il do some tests .
if fry is out there somewhere , leela' s brain could be acting like as five pounds ouija board .
is this some sort of brain scanner ?
some sort , yes .
in france it' s called a guillotine .
professor !
can' t you examine my brain without removing it ?
yes , easily .
hey !
what if fry wasn' t actually dead when we buried him ?
you know , like julia roberts .
well , i suppose there' s a slim ...
i don' t believe it !
what is it ?
is fry alive in some other dimension or something ?
no !
according to this gizmo meter , fry is dead and nothing can bring him back .
remarkable !
but ...
my dream !
your science can' t unprove that !
how could i have know the gift was in fry' s locker ?
easy .
he told you about it before he died and your grief roasted mind block it out !
are you saying ... i' m going crazy ?
no !
no one' s saying that .
but i' m certainly thinking it loudly .
hi leela !
i' m gonna keep talking , even if you can' t here me !
shut up , i can hear you !
the professor says you' re just a dream .
oh yeah ?
could a dream take you dancing in an illusion garden ?
well , yes technically .
but it' s still very sweat of you .
then what if me shared a midnight sleigh ride across the ice field of hiperia ?
oh fry , you must be alive ,
i' ve never been treated so romantically by my own imagination before .
here , take my jacket .
you look a little cold .
thank you .
it' s all so beautiful .
i' ve forgot how many hundreds of degrees below zero it must be .
i just wish i could convice the other you' re alive .
you can .
all you have to do is wake up .
no !
no !
don' t say that !
this is real !
not an other dream !
fry' s jacket !
the one he was burried in .
my dream was real !
he' s alive !!
quit your bragging , my boyfriend' s alive too .
not anymore .
that' s better .
fry is alive !
i have proof !
you do not !
i' m from jamaca the show me island , so show me you' re blowing it out your fanny .
but he gave me his jacket , look !
that' s not fry' s jacket .
fry' s jacket is read .
that' s your jacket .
an off the rack lime green affair .
but fry ... his jacket ...
and when i woke up , it was on me !
you' re under a lot of gilted stress , leela .
here , work it off .
i am not under stress , damn it !
everything gonna be alright , leela .
what ?
i said : everything gonna be alright .
maybe i' m freaking out a little .
a little ?
you' re screwier than my aunt rita .
she' s a screw .
i need to calm down .
i' m gonna take some more of that space honey .
you' ve been taking space honey ?
be careful you purple haired imbecile !
one spoonful calms you down .
two spoonfuls help you sleep .
but three spoonfuls and you' re going into a sleep so deep ... you' re never wake up .
never !
one spoonful to calm me down .
i' ve got a pretty good calm going !
2 spoonfuls to help me sleep .
still awake .
i guess one more spoon full couldn' t hurt .
oh my gosh !
i' d better get a sponge !
is that you ?
i don' t need a sponge !
why am i sticky and naked ?
did i miss something fun ?
incredible !
according to the gizmo meter
fry touched the royal jelly in the space hive ,
leaving an imprint of his dna and brainwaves .
then when it spilled on the couch , it recombines with trace amounts of fry' s hair and skin .
and blood .
don' t forget about fry' s blood !
yes bender .
thank you .
in short , the various fluids fry left in the couch caused the royal jelly to regenerate his entire being !
neat !
this is great !
my buddy is alive an his credit cards are valuable again !
let' s go get hamered !
i should warn you , i' m a mean drunk .
i' m so glad i didn' t kill you .
me too !
felling responsible for your death was driving me mad !
but now everything is alright !
not everything .
what ?
what do you mean ?
you have to wake up !
wake up ?
oh , no , no .
it can' t be ...
i' m cracking up .
in my dreams i' m happy because fry is alive , but when i' m awake , my mind plays tricks on me .
take it easy leela .
in every life we have some trouble .
but when you worry , you make it double .
don' t worry , be happy !
the landlords says your rent is late .
you may have to litigate .
but don' t worry !
bee happy !
ain' t got no cash , ain' t got no style .
ladies vomit when i smile .
but does zoidberg worry ?
feh !
you wish .
bee happy !
don' t worry now , amy !
ok , i' m happy !
take us home , bender !
don' t worry !
bee happy !
were you just singing ?
no .
i was telling you not to worry .
i' m not allowed to sing .
court order .
i' il find fry' s coffin , get his corpse and keep it under my mattress to remind me that he' s really dead .
that' il prove i' m not insane !
ok .
it' s just an ordinary coffin .
containing my ordinary dead friend .
who i killed .
what happened ?
why am i at my apartment ?
you killed fry !
stop it !
you killed fry .
ok , i' m insane .
but i' m still sane enough to know it .
the only time i feel alright is in my dreams .
with you .
3 spoonfuls , then ... i can dream forever .
one ... ... two ...
here goes !
goodbye waking world !
leela , no !
listen to me !
you don' t wanna lie in bed like a vegetable and do nothing the rest of your life .
i' ve tried it .
bedsores hurt !
what am i supposed to do ?
fight it !
i can' t !
you can .
the leela i know doesn' t give up this easily .
ok , i' il try .
go away !
i don' t know if you can hear me leela , but there is something that i want to tell you .
i love you .
i' m so scared fry , i don' t know what to do !
just wake up leela , please , just wake up .
i don' t understand what you mean !
just wake up , please , just wake up leela .
you' re alive .
you' re awake .
of course i' m awake , you wouldn' t stop waking me .
where am i ?
in an hospital .
the ambulance brought you here right out after the bee stung you .
but the bee stung you .
it barely touched me .
the sting went right through me and you got all the poison .
my new spleen came from a guy who liked the motorcycle .
sweet three toed sloth of ice planet hoth !
she' s awake !
you wera in the best coma i' ve ever seen !
the doctor said you' d never wake up .
really ?
how long was i out ?
2 weeks .
fry never left your side for a minute .
and he talked non stop , like a parrot of the sea he was .
i thought maybe if you heard a familiar voice , it might help keep your mind together .
but who knows if it really got through ?
it got through , fry ...
it got through ...
you could really use a shower .
you too . joke0 [ kittensgivegas@ caramail . com ]
