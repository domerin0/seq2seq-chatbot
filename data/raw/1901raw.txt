now , children .
are you sitting comfortably ?
then i will begin .
this story started many thousand of years ago .
but it was all over in just 7 days .
all that long long time ago , none of the things we can see now .
the sun , the moon , the stars , the earth , animals and plants .
not a single one existed .
only god existed .
so only he could create .
and he did .
i imagine he has dead like all the rest .
ahh ... those were the days ...
mr toltle your hair .
yes ?
good morning , madam .
we' ve come about to ...
oh yes , of course ...
come in .
i wasn' t expecting you were so soon .
you are ... ?
i am bother smiths , madam .
and this is admond toltle .
please to meet you madam .
you must be the gardener .
that' s right , the gardener .
and this young lady called lydia .
does she has must experiences in service ?
don' t let her angle face fool you , madam .
she is older than she looks .
can you iron ?
what' s the matter ?
the cat got no tongue ?
she can' t talk , madam poor little mice of mute .
but she is good little worker , i can promise you that .
alright , the other girl i hadn' t spoke to her much anyway .
follow me , mrs. smiths , you and the girl sleep at upstairs .
and you ...
mr. ?
toltle , madam .
yes , toltle . you can sleep in the shed around the back .
this house has been neglected since servants disappeared almost a week ago .
you mean they just vanished ?
yep .
they didn' t collect the wages .
they just left then
what a strange thing to do !
this house is not an ideal home .
as in my advertisement requesting ... honest , hardworking people .
there' s nobody more hardworking than us , isn' t that right , mr. toltle ?
well , i will be honest ... and very hardworking .
the kitchen . l have breakfast at eight .
the children at nine .
lunch is set at one , and dinner at half past seven .
the master , madam ?
the master was killed in the war .
a year and a half ago .
which of you does the cooking ?
i am so sorry , madam .
which of you does the cooking ?
you will notice what i' m doin ' .
ln this house , no door must be open without previous one being closed first .
it is vital that you remember this .
it' s not as easy as it may seen .
there are 15 different keys for of the 50 doors .
mrs. smiths ... from tomorrow onwards , i' il leaving the keys and you' re in charge .
yes . madam .
the music room , that old piano was already here when we moved in .
please do not let the children thumb on it .
it set off my migraine .
silence is something that we pride very highly in this house .
you' il not find a telephone , a radio or anything that makes a sound .
we don' t have electricity either .
during the war , the german kept cutting it off ... so we just learn without it .
let' s continue ...
that' s no need to show us around the whole house .
yes !
yes , there is .
cause here , most of the time you can hardly see your way .
it' s often difficult to look up a table , a chair , a door , a side board .
what do you mean , madam ?
perhaps i should introduce you the children .
mr. toltle , you can go to the garden now .
you' il find tools in the shed .
yes , madam .
and you can start closing the curtain .
come .
i will wake them , and you wait here .
whatever you do , don' t open the curtain .
they' re still half asleep .
sweet little children .
well , what do you say ?
how do you do ?
how do you do ?
how do you do , children ?
my name is mrs. smiths .
but you can call me bother , if you like . what are your names ?
ann .
nicholas .
ann and nicholas .
what a pretty names .
what you goin' to be our new nanny ?
yes , my dears .
i' m your new nanny .
it' s time for the breakfast . lydia , go to the kitchen and close every curtain .
doctors are unable to find up the cure .
about what ?
their condition .
the children have a very serious allergy to light .
they have never been exposed to any light much stronger than this .
otherwise , in a matter of minutes they will break up in souls .
and begin to suffocated and will eventually to fatal . // my god !
i don' t like this toast .
why not ?
it tastes funny . l like it better before .
that is because before , somebody else made it .
when are they comin ' back ?
they' re not comin ' back , child .
just like daddy .
daddy is comin ' back , though . mrs. smiths , our father is fighting in the war in france .
it' s the world war .
i know , but he' s in france .
that' s enough , finish up your breakfast .
are you goin ' to leave us too ?
of course not .
why should i leave you ?
the other said they wouldn' t .
they did .
and when it happened ...
be quiet !
what do you mean , ann ?
what' d happened ?
mummy went mad .
nothing happened .
yes , it did .
no , it didn' t !
yes it did !
quiet !
what' s goin ' on ?
i want to see those plates empty in less than a minute , is that clear ?
mrs. smiths , would you come outside for a moment ? l have word with you .
yes , madam .
the postman usually comes every wednesday .
but i just checked the letterbox .
ln this week, he hasn' t .
i' m afraid i don' t follow , madam .
this letter should been collected and delivered to the newspaper five days ago .
since it never published , would you mind explain to me what you' re doin ' here ?
oh , i understand ...
remember exactly what i say when you opened the door to us .
the truth is , we just came by to ask for a chance .
you know , because like this will need someone who knows the rules .
you mean , you' ve served in a house like this one before .
this may surprise you .
we in fact , just worked here .
here ?
it was a few years ago .
lf you don' t mind i' m saying so , madam , it was the best years of my life .
because this house ... mean a lot to us .
perhaps you want to see our references , madam .
no , no ... no ...
don' t bother this , no need .
so , you say you know the house well .
like the back of my hand .
well , still assuming that the wall hasn' t been moved in the meantime .
nothing here is moved except the light .
but it changes everything .
yes , madam .
i don' t like fantasy . strange ideas , do you know what i mean ?
i think so , madam ...
my children sometimes have strange ideas .
but you mustn' t paying attention to them . children will be children .
yes of course , madam .
alright , you can stay .
thank you very much , madam .
what do you find so amusing ?
well ...
what ?
those children were really stupid .
why ?
because they only believe in jesus , and then they get killed for it .
and what would you gonna to do , deny christ ?
yes . lnside i would have believed in him .
but i wouldn' t told the roman .
ls that what you think too , nicholas ?
i see . so you both would have lie to the point to denying christ .
but what will happen afterwards ?
ln the next life ?
the one is waiting for us after we die ,
where if you have gone ?
where , nicholas ?
to the limbo .
what is the children limbo ?
one of the four hell .
which are ?
me ... me ... me ...
no , no , no ...
let him answer .
at the centre of the earth . where it is very very hot .
that' s where children goes , they' re liar , they don' t go there just for a few days .
they are the damned ... forever .
think about it .
try to imagine . the end of eternity .
close your eyes and try to imagine .
forever .
pain .
forever .
i' m getting dizzy .
now , do you understand justice above the truth .
alright , read lesson six .
can we go and play ?
you most certainly can not and you' re gonna to learn it by heart .
because you' re goin ' to read the lesson , all of it ?
and anymore protesting , there' il be no playing for today .
ln fact , maybe you can study inside the room .
no , no , no !
yes , yes , yes ...
we get scare if we were to separated .
you get scare ?
you don' t get use to the house by now .
what if we see a ghost ?
has your sister been telling you one of the story ?
i haven' t told him anything .
when you see a ghost , you say hello and you continue study
ann , come with me to the music room .
why me ?
take your book .
nicholas , i want to see that lesson // learn less than a hour .
mummy .
what ?
give me a kiss .
give me a kiss .
give me a kiss .
ann , wait for me outside .
you know i can' t .
mrs. smiths , close the curtain .
my daughter is going the living room .
yes , madam .
alright .
darling .
mummy can' t be with you all the time .
you must learn to be on your own .
whenever you' re afraid , i want you to squeeze it .
say " our father " , then your fear will go away .
it won' t .
yes , yes , it will .
don' t you see that when you do that ,
the lord is with you .
there is no reason to be afraid .
do you have any children ?
no , mr toltle and lydia are all i' ve got and i' m all they got .
was she born like that ?
i don' t remember .
was she born a mute ?
no .
i' ve finish work here .
you excuse me , i' il see mr. toltle to give him hand .
nicholas !
nicholas , i' m coming .
nicholas .
what' s the matter ?
why are you crying ?
i wasn' t crying , i was reading !
but , i just heard you ...
ann .
ann !
ann ?
are you alright ?
yes !
why were you crying ?
i wasn' t crying .
but i just heard you a moment ago .
there is no need to feel ashame .
i don' t ! lf i' ve been crying , i will tell you .
so , i imagined it , did l ?
no , it' s was that boy .
what boy ?
victor ,
who' s victor ?
the boy that was here a moment ago .
i told him to let me study .
but he wouldn' t stop crying .
i think he is a spoilt brag .
he said that we have to leave the house .
oh ?
did he now ?
why was he crying ?
because he doesn' t like this house , but he has to live here .
his father is a pianist ...
oh ?
his father is a pianist, is he ?
i have already told him that he is not allow to touch the piano .
so , you' ve spoken to his father as well ?
no , only with victor . his father is at the entrance // of the hall .
but i' ve just come from the hall , and there is no one there .
they must have gone upstairs .
that will do ann !
that' s enough .
now why are you crying ?
that was victor .
so where is he now ?
he went out through there .
tell me , how a boy can get in and out this room with this lock ?
i thought i made myself quite clear .
no door is to be open without the previous one being close . ls that so hard to understand ?
this house is like a ship, the light must be in contain by opening and closing the doors .
my children' s life are so important .
but madam , i ...
don' t argue with me , quiet !
now , which one of you was the last to enter that room ? lydia ?
she hasn' t got the key , i' ve already told you that .
well , that leave you then .
and then i went out to the garden .
you saw me with your own eyes .
i hope you' re not suggesting it was me ?
do you think i' il endanger the life of my own daughter ?
you' re not suppose to read at that table .
oh really ?
you are gonna to tell mummy ?
or perhaps you ?
did you really see a boy ?
yes , he is called victor .
ls he a ghost ?
don' t be stupid , ghosts aren' t like that .
what are they like ?
how do you know ?
because i' ve seen them .
they come out at night .
where ?
well , i don' t believe you saw that boy .
believe what you like , you soon will begging us to play with you .
nicholas .
what ?
look !
why have you opened the curtains ?
it wasn' t me .
who was then ? lt was victor .
he' s been doing it all night .
you' re lying , i' m gonna to tell mummy .
so , i am a liar , am l ?
yes .
victor , come out .
my stupid brother wants to see you .
leave me alone .
so , you don' t want to see him now ?
you' re a cowdy custard .
i will just have to do it myself then .
stop it , get out of my bed , both of you .
this is our bed .
no , it' s mine .
ann , please don' t put on that voice .
you be quiet , cowdy custard .
listen , if you don' t stop , i will call my mother .
you don' t know my mother .
and you don' t know my parents .
ann , i' m goin ' to tell mummy about you .

she was frighting me , i told her to be quiet ...
i' m fed up with you !

that was not we have agreed .
today you will be punish , and you will do as i say .
you can' t ask me for a forgiveness .
how dare you .
mummy , i won' t ask forgiveness for something that i didn' t do .
you told your brother there was someone else in the room . there was .
you' re lying !
i am not .
ann , do you remember the story about justice ?
children who don' t tell the truth ends up in limbo .
i' ve read the other day that' s for children who haven' t been baptised .
and i have .
did you look in on nicholas ?
yes madam , the little angel is fast asleep .
what about ann ?
she still on the stairs ?
yes , madam .
how long the punishment is going on ?
it has been three days now .
it' s up to her .
she has to swallow her pride and ask for forgiveness .
anyway , it' s about time she started to read the bible .
the priest will be very pleased to hear about that ,
he know perfectly well , the children can' t go out .
he told me yesterday he' il be by us soon as possible .
i' ve beginning to feel totally cut off from the world .
that' s true , madam .
ann , i can' t hear you .
lncidently , mrs. smiths , i have to put out the noise of lydia ,
running around above my head .
she' d been doing it back and forward .
would you tell her it' s not necessary to get around just to do cleaning ?
i couldn' t bear to take another migraine attack .
i' il tell her .
thank you .
what' s going on upstair ?
nothing , mummy .
i' m just reading like you' ve told me .
did you hear that as well ?
hear what ?
what was that ?
i don' t know .
ann , tell me who' s making that noise .
i can' t tell you , mummy .
you tell me .
i' ve told you there was someone in the room and you punished me
honey , i want the truth .
tell me if there is someone upstair .
there , in that junk room .
mummy , you' re letting the light in .
where did they go ?
they just came pass here .
which way did they go ?
over there , over there .
all and down there as well .
they are everywhere .
they said this house is their .
and they said they will take the curtain down as well .
madam , stay calm please .
i would not stay calm .
madam , this is a very old house the floor is squeezed from the foaming plan .
there were voices , i am telling you .
a boy and two women and they were talking together .
mummy , mummy , look .
i did it yesterday .
this is the father , this is the mother . this is victor this is the old woman .
what is this number stand for ?
that is the number of times ...
i see the old woman the most .
oh my god and heaven !
mrs. smiths , go to call mr. toltle .
we' ve to search the house immediately .
it' s alright , mummy' s here .
even she is not looking at you , but she can see you .
she' s always around said " come with me " .
ann , don' t lie to me !
honestly , mummy . and she asked me things victor told me she' s a witch .
what did she ask you ?
things .
we have to open all the curtains .
you both search the right side ...
then we' il search upstairs .
ann , why do you makeup such story ?
i don' t .
i read them in books .
well you shouldn' t believe everything that you read in books .
that' s what our mother said she says about the ghost are rubbish .
and then , she expect us to believe that everything we read in the bible .
don' t you believe it ?
believe something i don' t believe god makes the world in seven days .
i don' t believe that normans got all the animal into one boat .
no , i don' t believe that either .
have you mentioned any of this to your mother ?
madam .
yes ?
we' ve searched everywhere there is no one .
i see .
mrs. smiths .
yes , madam .
do you have any idea what this might be ?
it' s a photograph album , madam .
look .
they are all asleep .
they' re not asleep , madam .
they are dead .
this is the book of death .
ln the last century , i believe they take photographs of the death .
ln the hopes , their souls will go on living . oh , and children .
how can these people be so superstitious ?
grateful to the people that can lead them to do strange things .
get rid of it .
i don' t want it in the house . yes , madam .
mrs smiths , why don' t you come and sit by the fire ?
thank you very much .
warmer ...
do you have to take care of the children as well ?
so , i was in charge of the organising ... the houseworks .
are there many servants ?
oh !
about fifteen .
ln the end , there were just three of us left . why ?
my employers moved to london .
my family left at the summer of 1940 .
that was the last time i' ve heard from them .
was that when lydia went dumb ?
yes , i think so . you know my memory is little lost , madam .
what happen to her ?
suddenly one day , she just stop talking .
there must be a reason .
people don' t just stop talking .
something must have happened to her .
did your employers treat you well ?
oh !
they are always very kind to us .
they treated us just like family .
you know , madam .
i think i will go to bed .
you go .
i will stay here a while longer .
i' m sorry .
i shouted at you .
can you forgive me ?
mummy .
what ?
when is daddy comin ' home ?
when the war is over .
daddy went because he is very brave .
and because he wasn' t prepare to let the german tell him what he had to do .
mrs. smiths !
give me the keys , hurry up !
what' s happening ?
oh my god !
i' ve checked that room myself .
it was empty .
take this tablets , madam .
and yet , i found there was someone downstair .
and it wasn' t human .
there is something in this house .
something which is not like ... at rest .
you don' t believe it , do you ?
i don' t blame you .
i used to not believe in these things .
i do believe it , madam .
i' ve always believe in those things .
but that is not easy to explain .
but , they do happen . we all heard stories from beyond now and then .
the world of the death is mix up with the world of the living .
but it' s impossible . the lord will not allow such a thing like living with the death .
that will only mean only the eternity .
it say so in the bible .
there isn' t always an answer for everything .
where are you off to , madam ?
i' m goin ' to the village to find the father .
lf he won' t come here , then i' d go to him .
you should wait for the weather in full . i have waited long enough .
madam .
i don' t care what he has told you , tell me .
he must come today .
what are you gonna to tell him ?
to search every room inch by inch .
madam , please wait .
it' s still very early .
mr. toltle .
good morning , madam .
i need you to search the whole garden for grave stone . grave stone ?
when my husband bought this house he said there was a cemetary .
i' m not seeing anything !
take care , that could be overgrowth .
i need to know it there was a family buried here .
now she thinks the house is haunted .
do you think it' s safe to let her go ?
don' t worry .
the fog wouldn' t let her go very far .
oh yes !
the fog .
the fog , of course .
when do you think we should bring this out into the open ?
all in good time , all in good time .
speaking of which ...
oh !
charles !
grace .
oh !
oh ! lt can' t be true , it can' t be true .
they said you are dead .
they said a lot of things .
thank you god .
every night i pray for this , begging god to bring you back .
where have you been all this time ?
out there , looking for my home .
sometimes i bleed ...
madam .
mrs. smiths .

are you mad ?
the children are sensitive to light .
this will kill them .

why you didn' t move .
then i knew .
i killed my children .
i got the riffle .
i pulled the trigger .

you were playing with the pillow , like nothing has happened .
then i thought the lord and his great mercy , has given me another chance .
no give up , be strong be a good mother .
but then , but now ...

the young lady asked the very same thing .
and that was the last time she ever spoken .
i couldn' t tell you that before .
shall we make us a nice cup of tea ?
the intruder are leaving , but others will come .
some time we sense them , other time we won' t .
but that' s the way it always been .
