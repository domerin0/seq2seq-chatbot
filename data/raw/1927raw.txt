daddy ?
what' s that noise ?
it' s only a waterfall .
no , the other noise .
guns , sasha .
are they fighting ?
they must be .
it' s a long way away .
let' s go to sleep .
get him !
no !
look .
ls that all ?
that' s all .
bring him .
who sent you here ?
no one sent me here , commander .
i' m with my wife and child .
they' re on the train from moscow .
yes , we' ve checked that .
then ?
you put your knife with a fork and a spoon and it looks innocuous .
perhaps you travel with a wife and child for the same reason .
yuryatin is occupied by white guards .
is that why you' re going there ?
no , we' re going on to varykino .
not through yuryatin .
it' s under shellfire .
commander , i' m not a white agent .
no , i don' t think you are .
all right , kolya .
thank you .
sit down , doctor .
take it .
it' s not as silly as it seems .
there have been one or two attempts .
are you the poet ?
yes .
i used to admire your poetry .
thank you .
i shouldn' t now .
i should find it absurdly personal , don' t you agree ?
feelings , insights , affections .
it' s suddenly trivial now .
you don' t agree .
you' re wrong .
the personal life is dead in russia .
history has killed it .
i can see how you might hate me .
i hate everything you say , but not enough to kill you for it .
you have a brother .
yevgraf ?
yevgraf , yes .
the policeman .
i didn' t know that .
perhaps not .
a secret policeman .
did he send you here ?
yevgraf ?
no , yevgraf' s a bolshevik .
i don' t know anything about these things .
oh , you know a great deal .
when you came in , you recognized me .
how ?
has someone shown you photographs ?
no .
i am certain you recognized me .
i' ve seen you before .
when ?
six years ago .
go on .
christmas eve , you ...
you were there ?
or has someone told you this ?
i attended to the man who was injured by your wife .
why do you call her my wife ?
i met her again .
we served together on the ukrainian front .
i' m sure she' d vouch for me .
i haven' t seen her since the war .
she' s in yuryatin .
yuryatin ?
the private life is dead ... ... for a man with any manhood .
we saw a sample of your manhood on the way , at mink .
they sold horses to the whites .
no .
it seems you burnt the wrong village .
they always say that , does it matter ?
a village betrays us , one is burnt .
point made .
your point , their village .
kolya !
what will you do with your wife and child in varykino ?
just live .
take him away .
he' s innocent .
you' re lucky .
we were diverted .
do you know where to ?
varykino halt .
hello ?
how lovely .
oh , how lovely !
hello ?
alexander maximovich ?
yes .
it' s me , petya .
your honor .
now , now , now .
that' s all done with , you know .
how do we get to the house , petya ?
as you always did .
look , sasha .
what is it , petya ?
forest fire ?
forest fire , your honor ?
that' s yuryatin .
poor souls .
first the reds , then the whites .
now the reds again .
that strelnikov , his heart must be dead .
go on .
we' il soon be there , sasha .
another five miles .
is it that far ?
one forgets .
how is the place ?
well enough , your honor .
it' s all locked up , you know ?
varykino .
all locked up , you see .
a body , styling itself ... ... the " yuryatin committee of revolutionary justice " ... ... has expropriated my house in the name of the people .
very well .
i' m one of the people too !
don' t , your honor !
they' d call it counterrevolution .
father , don' t .
petya brought us here , making him a counterrevolutionary .
they shoot counterrevolutionaries .
it' s not the reds in the town , but in the forest .
partisans .
here ?
who knows ?
they go where they want and do what they want .
all we need is a roof .
and a bit of garden .
is there nowhere ?
they didn' t lock the cottage .
oh , yes , we can manage here .
the stove works .
i' il find a few sticks of furniture .
and some seed potatoes ?
i' m afraid the garden is dreadfully run back .
yes , thank you .
well done , my boy .
scratch a russian and you' il find a peasant .
i' ve always said so .
well , you' re wrong .
he works like a peasant but he isn' t a peasant .
i don' t mind , tonya , really .
it' s a good life .
certainly is .
i wouldn' t be surprised if you looked back on this time as one of your best .
awfully glad about the expected new arrival , yuri .
anna was born here , you know .
no , i didn' t know that .
oh , i' m terribly glad .
here' s winged mercury .
looks a bit down in the mouth .
petya .
what news from yuryatin ?
no lard , no sugar .
oil next week , perhaps .
flour , salt , coffee ... ... and nails .
bad news ?
oh , lord , not another purge .
no .
strelnikov' s gone .
well , that' s not bad news .
no , he' s in manchuria , they say .
that' s the news .
they' ve shot the tsar .
and all his family .
oh , that' s a savage deed !
what' s it for ?
it' s to show there' s no going back .
yuri , why don' t you go to yuryatin ?
yes , why don' t you , my boy ?
it' d do you good .
why ?
what' s in yuryatin ?
it isn' t petersburg .
very decent little library there .
lf it' s still there .
i wish you would .
no , i don' t think so .
anyway , the roads are blocked .
zhivago .
yes .
how are you ?
what are you doing here ?
we' re at varykino .
varykino ?
why varykino ?
why not ?
we had to go somewhere .
but here ?
i came to find my husband .
the one reported killed .
strelnikov .
i met him .
met him ?
yes .
how long have you been living here ?
about a year .
alone ?
with katya .
where is katya now ?
at school .
is tonya with you ?
all of us .
sasha ?
of course .
what are we going to do ?
i don' t know .
yuri ?
it' s awfully early , isn' t it ?
half past 6 .
what' re you doing ?
nothing .
couldn' t sleep .
ls anything the matter ?
no .
shall i get some tea ?
yes , do .
hello .
you are silly .
we called and called .
did you ?
i didn' t hear .
well , we did .
hello , lara .
hello .
how' s olya petrovna ?
she gets worse and worse .
she gave us c. i. and arithmetic all morning .
c. i. ?
civic instruction .
look .
that' s very good , katya .
thank you .
it' s the tsar .
the tsar' s an enemy of the people .
well , he didn' t know he was an enemy of the people .
well , he should' ve known , shouldn' t he ?
yes , he should .
fancy not knowing c. i. doesn' t your little boy go to school ?
lunch .
good .
come on , you .
smell .
what ?
this one' s a prizefighter .
yuri .
wait a minute .
there .
i' m going into yuryatin , darling .
what , now ?
yes , i want to get some morphine , disinfectant .
i shan' t need morphine .
you never know .
i shan' t need it today .
no , but it' s pretty close .
i hadn' t realized .
you' il be back before dark ?
long before .
yes , yes , my darling , do what' s best .
i am not coming back .
i understand .
but never , lara !
you understand ?
do you believe me ?
comrade doctor , i need a medical officer .
sorry , i have a wife and child in varykino .
and a mistress in yuryatin .
comrade medical officer , we are red partisans .
and we shoot deserters .
where are you taking me ?
to the front .
and where is the front ?
good question , doctor .
it' s where there are enemies of the revolution .
wherever there is one gang of white guards or foreign interventionists .
where there' s a resentful bourgeois , an unreliable schoolmaster ... ... one dubious poet hugging his private life .
that too is the front .
how long will you keep me ?
for as long as we need you .
now !
charge !
well , that was easy .
come on , doctor , let' s see what we' ve done .
st. michael' s military school .
you old bastard !
it doesn' t matter .
did you ever love a woman , razin ?
i once had a wife and four children .
he has been a good comrade .
and a good medic .
we took him from his wife and from his child .
none of this matters .
what does matter , comrade commissar ?
tell me , i' ve forgotten .
this is contemptible .
he stays .
i command this unit !
we command jointly .
the party bulletin expressly states ...
i could have you taken out and shot .
and could you have the party taken out and shot ?
as the military struggle nears its close , the political one intensifies .
in victory , the military will have served its purpose .
all men will then be judged politically ... ... regardless of their military record .
meanwhile , there are still white units in this area .
the doctor stays .
that concludes the meeting .
comrade , where are you going ?
are you running away , comrade ?
soldiers .
red soldiers or white soldiers ?
soldiers .
tonya ?
tonya !
sasha !
tonya !
this is yuryatin ?
yes , yuryatin .
what' s happened at varykino ?
moscow folks ?
yes .
they' ve gone away .
gone away .
there' s nobody at varykino .
lord , what happiness !
they say you' re alive .
someone saw you near the town .
i take it you' ve gone to varykino , so i' m going there myself with katya .
just in case , i' ve left a little food .
boiled potatoes mostly .
put the lid back on the pan or the rats will get it .
i' m mad with joy !
tonya .
tonya !
yuri .
tonya !
yuri .
tonya .
yuri , darling .
it' s all right , yuri .
they' re safe .
they' re in moscow .
ln moscow ?
yes .
tonya ?
all of them .
they' re safe .
safe .
firing squads !
better .
what ?
i' ve got a letter for you .
i' ve had it three months .
and it was three months getting here .
it' s from moscow .
i think it' s from tonya .
it' s addressed to you , care of me .
she came into yuryatin to find you when you vanished .
someone sent her here .
you met ?
she' s very fine .
my dearest dear .
i' m sending this to larissa antipova' s ... ... because if you are alive , which god grant ... ... i think that is where you will go .
we have a little daughter , yuri .
did you know ?
her name' s anna .
father sends greetings .
sasha has grown quite a lot .
he' s quite big now .
whenever we speak of you , he weeps and won' t be comforted .
we are being deported from russia .
we can' t make out if you' d be allowed to join us .
an organization in paris , which i mustn' t name , will know where we are .
nothing is certain , and there' s little time .
i' m writing this in haste .
they' re coming for us now .
god bless you .
i must honestly admit that antipova is a good person .
yuri , when they got away to moscow , she left something here .
yuri ?
may i come in ?
yuri andreyevich , you' ve changed , i think .
oh , yes , decidedly .
larissa ... ... remarkably the same .
i came from moscow .
i' m on the way to vladivostok .
i' m here to offer you my help .
we don' t want it .
speak for yourself .
we don' t want it .
yuri andreyevich , you spent two years with the partisan' s 5th division .
you have no discharge , so you are a deserter .
your family in paris is involved in a dangerous migr organization .
now all these are technicalities .
but your style of life ... ... everything you say , your published writings , are flagrantly subversive .
your days are numbered ... ... unless i help you .
do you want my help ?
no .
wait , yuri .
larissa , three glasses .
no .
yuri , you must see how serious this is .
please don' t underestimate me .
practically or morally , i' m not the man you take me for .
how do you know all this about yuri ?
how can you help ?
i do and i can .
isn' t that sufficient ?
no .
our eastern seaboard is an undeveloped area .
the commissariat of foreign affairs wants to form an independent state .
it affords us a temporary channel of communication with the outside world .
i have good contacts in the far east .
i' ve been appointed the minister of justice .
the bolsheviks trust you ?
they trust no one .
they found me useful .
here' s how i can help you .
you come with me as far as the pacific coast .
from there you can go where you like .
to paris , or not .
i think you' d better go .
your rarefied selfishness is intolerable .
larissa' s in danger too .
by association with me ?
no .
not by association with you .
you' re a small fry .
by association with strelnikov .
i never met strelnikov .
you' re married to him , they know that .
i was married to pasha antipov .
i understand , i understand .
but they don' t .
you' re being watched .
do you know why ?
a husband is a sticky commodity , my dear .
go away .
more of your high minded lunacy ?
you have a child to think of !
look here .
that' s sugar for the child .
i don' t want it .
you would refuse my sugar ?
who are you to refuse me anything ? !
now you go .
i came ...
go !
go !
i came to you in good faith .
stay here then , and get your desserts !
your desserts , do you hear me ?
do you think you' re immaculate ?
you' re not immaculate !
i know you !
do you hear me ? !
we' re all made of the same clay , you know !
clay !
clay !
lara ?
he' s rubbish , lara .
yes .
rubbish .
i wish he' d never happened .
does it matter ?
doesn' t it ?
not to me .
what shall we do ?
can we get on a train ?
no , they' d arrest us on the spot .
i don' t want to stay here and wait .
no .
listen ... ... we could go to ...
varykino .
they' d find out sooner or later .
yes , but later .
lf our days are really numbered ...
yes .
we' d better live them ... ... before we are parted .
yes .
father caught a flea !
ho , ho , ho
i love the snow one , two , three
anna taught me to write at this desk .
this isn' t me , yuri .
yes , it is .
no .
it' s you .
lara .
yuri !
yuri , there' s a wolf howling !
oh , yes , i' ve ...
i' ve seen them .
they' re frightened .
they won' t harm us .
yes , i know .
i' m sorry .
it' s ...
oh , lord , this is an awful time to be alive !
no .
it is .
it is !
no , no .
wouldn' t it have been lovely if we' d met before ?
before we did ?
yes .
we' d have got married , had a house and children .
if we' d had children , yuri , would you have liked a boy or a girl ?
i think we may go mad if we think about all that .
i shall always think about it .
will you write today ?
no , not today .
katya !
come to me , darling .
victor !
we thought it was ...
quite .
i wonder if you' d mind , comrades ?
my government has a train , standing in yuryatin .
there' s a carriage for me and my assistants .
you will travel in comfort and safety .
i' m not going with you .
i' m not going without you .
so there' s an end to it .
then i' il have to speak to yuri andreyevich in private .
strelnikov is dead .
what ?
spare me your expressions of regret .
he was a murderous neurotic , and no loss to anyone .
do you see how this affects larissa ?
you don' t ?
you' re a fool .
she' s strelnikov' s wife .
why do you think they haven' t arrested her ?
why do you think they had her watched ?
they were waiting for strelnikov .
if they thought he' d come running to his wife , they didn' t know him .
they knew him well enough .
they caught him five miles from here .
he was arrested on the road .
he didn' t conceal himself .
throughout the interview ... ... he insisted they call him pavel antipov ... ... and refused to answer to " strelnikov .
on his way to execution , he took a pistol and blew his own brains out .
oh , my god !
don' t tell lara this .
i think i know her at least as well as you .
but don' t you see her position ?
she' s served her purpose .
these men who came to escort me today will come tomorrow as a firing squad .
now i know exactly what you think of me , and why .
but if you' re not coming with me , she' s not coming .
so are you coming with me ?
do you accept the protection of this ignoble caliban on any terms ?
is your delicacy so exorbitant ... ... that you' d sacrifice a woman and a child to it ?
there' s some bags to carry , comrades .
get in .
come .
how many ?
all of us .
sorry , not enough room .
there' s got to be room .
it' s all right .
i' il bring our sledge .
hurry .
this train has important people .
you start .
i' il catch you up .
right , comrades !
we' il see you at ...
hurry !
i' m afraid that' s it .
your young man' s not coming .
you fool .
did you really think he would come with you ?
the man' s an idiot .
from mongolia he could' ve gone to ...
he' il never leave russia .
you' ve come with me , haven' t you ?
yes .
to be sure , it was your duty as a mother .
that' s right , victor .
i' m carrying yuri' s child .
i was born out there .
in the far east somewhere .
maybe mongolia .
i don' t remember .
you were born in mongolia , that very year .
so were a lot of others .
not many named tonya , bearing the name komarov .
komarov' s a common name .
with fair hair , blue eyes , lost at 8 when war broke out in the far east ?
there' s something you haven' t told me .
how did you come to be lost ?
i can' t remember !
you must remember something !
no !
i' il tell you how i first met your mother .
lf she was my mother .
you judge .
i picked my brother up , literally , on a moscow street .
he had a fourth class ration book and was undernourished .
he didn' t seem to mind that or anything .
i thought he was a happier man than me .
he suffered me to buy him a new suit ... ... and to get him a job at his old hospital .
i saw him off for his first day' s work .
this was eight years after he and lara parted .
so he never saw her again ?
thank you .
you' ve been very kind to me .
he must' ve known how ill he was .
the walls of his heart were like paper .
but he kept it to himself .
he kept a lot to himself .
please .
i was astonished at the extent of his reputation .
his work was unobtainable at the time .
it was disapproved of by the party .
but if people love poetry , they love poets .
and nobody loves poetry like a russian .
excuse me , comrade .
are you yevgraf ?
my name is lara .
i knew her name from the lara poems i' d found with yuri' s manuscripts .
i knew your brother .
i need your help .
she' d come to moscow to look for her child .
i helped her as far as i could .
but i knew it was hopeless .
i think i was a little in love with her .
one day she went away and didn' t come back .
she died or vanished somewhere ... ... in one of the labor camps .
a nameless number on a list that was afterwards mislaid .
that was quite common in those days .
tonya .
how did you come to be lost ?
we were running in a street .
we ?
my father .
not your father .
komarovsky .
i don' t know !
the street was on fire .
there were explosions and houses were falling down .
he let go of my hand !
he let go of my hand .
and i was lost .
your father would' ve done that ?
oh , yes .
people will do anything .
it was komarovsky .
this man was your father .
why won' t you believe it ?
don' t you want to believe it ?
not if it isn' t true .
that' s inherited .
comrade general , when i was a child , i wanted parents .
you can imagine how i wanted parents .
i wanted to die when i was a child .
you know ?
now i don' t know .
i can' t be of any use to them now , can i ?
i was hoping i might be of some use to you .
will you think about it ?
yes .
it' s all right , david .
you work here ?
yes , i' m an operator .
and what do you operate ?
that .
you' ve promised to think about it .
tonya !
can you play the balalaika ?
can she play ?
she' s an artist !
an artist ?
who taught you ?
no one taught her .
then it' s a gift .
