i' m mr. kill .
now there' s a name to die for .
521 km/ h !
that' s a new personal best , boss .
thruster 2 cut out again .
get it fixed , will you .
glad you could make it , mr. bond .
how did you like my run ?
looked like a man on the edge of losing control .
it' s only by being on the edge that we know who we really are ... ... under the skin .
take your donald campbell , 1967 , the bluebird , water speed record .
campbell died on his return run .
yes , but he died chasing a dream .
isn' t that way to go ?
i' d rather not go at all .
i see you don' t chase dreams , you live them .
one of the virtues of never sleeping , mr. bond .
i have to live my dreams .
besides , plenty of time to sleep when you' re dead .
mr. bond .
oh , miss frost .
i' il show you your room .
a palace of ice .
you must feel right at home .
this whole place was built for tonight' s demonstration .
i' m told the human element necessitates ... a precise balance of heat and cold .
built on a lake ?
i hope graves got things right .
and what' s the little property i noticed next door ?
the diamond mine ... and gustav' s living quarters .
thank you .
this is you .
wonderful
would you like to show me more ?
vodka martini , plenty of ice if you can spare it .
mojito ?
james !
here for penguins this time ?
or for the view again ?
right now i' m only interested in endangered species .
oh well , does that include me ?
depends what you' re up to this time .
so i left you in an explosive situation , you' re a big boy , figured you could handle yourself .
no wonder your relationships don' t last .
i' m a girl who just doesn' t like to get tied down .
you' re still feeling the side effects ?
the insomnia is permanent for me .
an hour in the dream machine keeps me sane .
what happened to you ?
bond .
he knows nothing .
i' ve been this close to him and he still didn' t know who i really was .
you saw my father after you were exchanged ?
yes .
general moon still mourns your death .
my death .
mr. bond .
and miss ...
swift , " space and technology magazine " .
really ?
i take it mr. bond has been explaining his " big bang " theory .
oh yes , i think i got the ... thrust of it .
i see .
the demonstration is about to begin in five minutes .
shall we ?
shall we ?
not jinx any more ?
i' il always be a jinx to you .
as you know ...
i' m always trying to give the planet something in return for what it has given me .
those little shards of heaven , known as diamonds .
diamonds aren' t just expensive stones .
they are the stuff of dreams .
and a means to make dreams real .
imagine .. being able to bring light and warmth to the darkest parts of the world .
imagine being able to grow crops the year round , bringing an end to hunger .
imagine ...
a second sun , shining like a diamond in the sky .
let there be light .
i give you icarus .
icarus is unique .
it' s miraculous silver skin will inhale the sun' s light and breathe it gently upon the earth' s surface .
you have no idea , how much icarus is about to change your world .
and now let us brighten this night with our inner radiance .
vlad .
show me the modifications .
yes .
here is the self defense mechanism you asked me to build in .
50, 000 volts ?
100, 000 .
armed ... ... and very dangerous .
oh , very .
what are you doing here ?
hands up .
m " warned me this would happen .
that' s why you tried so hard not to be interested in me .
oh god , you' re even worse than your file says .
you don' t look too convinced .
come on , put your back into it , eh ?
remember i know all about you , 007 .
sex for dinner , death for breakfast , well it' s not gonna work with me .
no ?
no .
you' re getting good at this .
oh , stop it .
are we still being watched ?
no , they left ages ago .
oh god , you are impossible .
come on , let' s get out of here .
you better stay here tonight .
keep up the charade of being lovers .
all right .
i must say i admire your restraint .
you were here full two hours before anything blew up .
the way you' re going will get us both killed .
james , tell me what really happened in north korea .
i was betrayed .
that was all .
occupational hazard .
this is crazy , you' re a 00 .
it' s only a number .
james ...
be careful .
go back to your room .
i' il come back for you .
why do you want to kill me ?
i thought it was the humane thing to do .
who sent you ?
your mama .
she told me to tell you she' s really disappointed in you .
i' il let you in on a little secret .
this mine is fake .
but the lasers ... ... are real .
she won' t talk .
let' s make it permanent .
i' il use the laser .
don' t leave a mess .
jinx ?
james , turn it off !
james !
i could use a little help here !
switch it off !
or i will be half the girl i used to be .
so that' s the girl who hates to be tied down , eh ?
are you gonna get me off this thing ?
what are you ?
cla ?
nsa .
hello , we' re on the same side .
doesn' t mean we' re after the same thing .
sure it does ...
world peace , unconditional love , and your little friend with the expensive acne .
zao ?
yes , zao .
he' s back there with some weird psychedelic light mask .
probably brought it from the clinic in cuba .
he couldn' t have brought it .
it was already here .
it belongs to another korean .
his boss .
i think we need kill to give us a hand to get out of here .
i got a better idea .
i' m going back up .
wait ...
go to miranda first , she is ml6 .
warn her to get out .
and what are you going to do ?
unfinished business .
so you live to die another day .
colonel .
at last .
i was beginning to think you' d never guess .
was it painful ?
the gene therapy .
you couldn' t possibly imagine .
oh , good .
i' m glad to hear that .
ah , but there have been compensations .
like watching you float around in your ignorance .
granting you life day by day just to see if you get wise .
it' s been fun .
well the fun is about to come to a dead end .
we only met briefly , you and i.
but you left a lasting impression .
you see , when your intervention forced me to present the world with a new face ...
i chose to model the disgusting gustav graves on you , adjusting the details .
that unjustifiable swagger , your crass quips , a defense mechanism concealing such inadequacy .
my defense mechanism is right here .
so .. miss frost isn' t all she seems .
looks can be deceptive .
yes
by the way , did you find out who betrayed you in north korea ?
only a matter of time .
you never thought of looking inside your own organization .
she was right under your nose .
it was so good of you to bring your gun to bed with us .
yes .. occupational hazard .
you see , i have a gift .
an instinct for sensing people' s weaknesses .
yours is women .
hers and mine is winning whatever the cost .
so , when i arranged for the fatal overdose for the true winner at sidney ...
i won myself my very own ml6 agent .
using everything at my own disposal .
her brains , her talent , ... even her sex .
the coldest weapon of all .
hello .
miranda ?
there will be others after me .
you know that .
oh you mean your american friend , jinx .
soon to be victim of a tragedy .
an ice palace can be such a treacherous place .
hand over the toys .
you know , i' ve missed your sparkling personality .
how' s that for a punch line ?
kill him .
i enjoyed last night , james .
but it really is death for breakfast .
kill him .
now !
he got away .
no matter .
the pleasure of the kill is in the chase ..
bring me the generals .
gentlemen , i promised you a demonstration .
now you will see the true power of icarus .
a western spy runs but he cannot hide .
icarus will lock on to the heath signature , and concentrate the sun' s power .
hey boss .
he beat your time .
time to draw the line .
global warming is a terrible thing .
nice moves .
just like bond .
he was pretty vigorous last night as well .
he did you ?
i didn' t know he was that desperate .
well , he' s not coming back for you .
just died , running , trying to save his own skin .
it' s pretty good tailoring .
i hope it doesn' t shrink when it gets wet .
you ve got one hour to wrap this up .
let' s move .
come on , jinx .
where are you ?
all units report .
now !
warning .
adaptive camouflage failure .
time to give the american her bath .
adaptive camouflage restored .
vlad , does the word ergonomics mean anything to you ?
man , machine ...
this ... is still a suitcase .
finish it , will you .
come now , it' s warm in here .
come on .
the cold kept you alive .
what took you so long ?
agent johnson .
james .
charles .
okay , bring us up to speed on this .
another lost division' s been demobilized north of the dmc .
that is 80, 000 troops and counting .
and another million in reserve .
moon' s father won' t let this turn into a war .
general moon is under arrest .
the hardliners staged a coup last night .
the fact remains that you deliberately misled me by implicating bond .
if you' d told us about your agent in the cuban clinic ...
she would be dead already .
your mole would have made sure of that .
we wouldn' t have had a mole at all if you had disclosed the fact ... that miss frost and moon were on the harvard fencing team together .
knowing who to trust is everything in this business .
well , well , james bond .
just in time for the fireworks .
let' s get down to business .
we are at defcon 2 .
and if the north go south , they' re gonna go south big time .
you don' t just stroll through the world' s biggest mine field .
you need some kind of an edge ... ... icarus .
we' re taking care of that .. with an a sat launch , in one hour .
where is graves ?
in the middle of a north korean air base .
right where we can' t touch him .
you can' t .
but i can .
look , we' re here in case things escalate .
not to make sure that they do .
no incursions into the north .
the president gave me a direct order .
and when did that ever stop you ?
you make your own decisions .
i' m sending in 007 .
you think i' d leave this in the hands of the british ?
you go with him .
approaching jump zone .
ok , let' s go !
they have entered north korean air space .
relax , robinson .
if our radar can' t see those switch blades , ... the north koreans sure as hell can' t .
hey boss .
they have launched against icarus .
leave it on automatic .
i hope nobody here is superstitious , ... ... that' s one big mirror we' re about to break .
my god !
mobilize the south korean troops .
and give me the president , now !
still no news about bond ?
vehicles .
some big shots ...
it' s him
300 meters .
windage 1/ 2 .
we gotta get on that plane .
you !
have my father brought down .
i don' t know you .
you' ve always found it difficult to accept me .
that made my exile easier to bare , but ...
i never forgot what you taught me .
in war the victorious strategist only seeks battle ... ... after the victory has been won .
you see , father .
i remember my art of war .
and this is what guarantees that victory .
my son .
what have you done to yourself ?
come father .
watch the rising of your son .
the second that thing hits the 38th parallel we' re gonna hit them with everything we ve got .
that may not be enough .
do you see , father ?
icarus is clearing the mine field creating a highway for our troops .
if the americans don' t run , icarus will destroy them .
japan is a bug waiting to be squashed .
and the west will shake with fear .
the americans will send nuclear warheads !
icarus will swat them from the sky .
you will destroy us .
you would kill your own son ?
the son i knew died long ago .
caution !
caution !
manual !
manual !
i got it .
my , my .. you get around .
let' s see your gun .
uh uh !
left hand !
that' s it ...
that' s it ...
now drop it !
looks like your friends have bailed .
push on autopilot .
come on .
that' s it .
good girl .
drowning you didn' t seem to work .
i' il have to try something more to the point .
one thousand meters and closing .
i can read your every move .
read this .
bitch !
oh look !
parachutes for both of us !
oops .. not anymore .
you see , mr. bond .. you can' t kill my dreams .
but my dreams can kill you .
time to face destiny .
time to face gravity .
i think i broke her heart .
looks like we' re going down together .
not yet .
get the back open !
okay .
come on !
i told you i was a jinx !
i should have warned you .
my relationships don' t last either .
at least we' re gonna die rich !
huh ?
come on .
come on .
you said something about going down together ?
james !
moneypenny .
oh , james .
moneypenny ? !
i was um ... ... just testing it out !
it' s rather hard , isn' t it ?
yes .. very !
wait , don' t pull it out !
i' m not finished with it yet .
see ?
it' s a perfect fit .
uh huh ...
leave it in .
it' s gonna come out sooner or later .
no , leave it in , please .. .. a few more minutes .
we really have to get these back .
still the good guys , huh ?
i' m still not quite sure ... how good you are .
i' m so good ...
especially when you' re bad !
