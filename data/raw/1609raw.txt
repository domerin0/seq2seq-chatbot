and the lord said unto moses , go .
return into egypt .
and moses took his wife and his son and he returned to the land of egypt .
and moses took the rod of god in his hand .
let the ambassador from priam , king of troy , approach the pharaoh .
great pharaoh , the gift of troy is a fabulous fabric from the land of the five rivers .
our thanks to priam .
it is fabulous indeed .
it shimmers like the nile .
how is it made ?
no one knows .
it is spun on the looms of the gods .
they call it silk .
the ambassador from jericho .
what kingdom has sent you ?
the kingdom of the most high .
what gifts do you bring ?
we bring you the word of god .
what is this word ?
thus sayeth the lord god of lsrael , let my people go !
the slaves are mine .
their lives are mine .
all that they own is mine .
i do not know your god , nor will i let lsrael go .
who are you to make their lives bitter in bondage ?
men shall be ruled by law , not the will of other men .
who is this god that i should let your people go ?
aaron .
cast down my staff before pharaoh that he may see the power of god .
ln this you shall know that the lord is god .
mother !
he turned his staff into a cobra !
nothing of hls will harm you , my son .
the power of your god is a cheap magician s trick .
jannes .
mother , look !
jannes , do you see ?
moses serpent swallows up the others .
you gave me this staff to rule over scorpions and serpents , but god made it a rod to rule over kings .
hear his word , rameses , and obey .
obey ?
moses , moses ...
are there no magicians in egypt that you have come back to make serpents out of sticks ?
or cause rabbits to appear ?
i will give your staff a greater wonder to perform .
bear it before your idle people and bid them make bricks without straw .
how can that be done ?
let his staff provide them .
or let them glean straw for themselves .
but their tally of bricks shall not diminish .
so let it be written .
so let it be done .
aaron .
aaron , when do we leave egypt ?
we do not leave egypt .
but moses promised us .
but you said we d be freed !
i have brought more evil upon you .
god forgive my weak use of his strength .
moses , what have you done to us ?
it is pharaoh s order that you be given no straw to make your tally of bricks .
no straw ?
how can we make bricks without straw ?
you will glean the fields by night .
your women and children , too .
ls this the deliverer ?
you ve brought the wrath of pharaoh upon us !
you put a sword in their hands !
stone him !
stone him !
stand aside !
come !
follow !
there goes your deliverer .
now go find your straw .
remember the tally must be the same .
not one brick less .
i cursed you .
each time rameses took me in his arms i cursed you , not him , because i love you .
the moses who loved you was another man .
no , he was not .
you believe you ve changed , but you haven t .
you call yourself a prophet , a man of god , but i know better .
i don t believe only the thunder of a mountain stirs your heart , as you stir mine .
nefretiri , i have stood in the burning light of god s own presence .
it was not he who saved you just now .
i did that .
oh , moses , moses .
why , of all men , did i fall in love with the prince of fools ?
but i believe anything you tell me when l m in your arms .
why must you deny me and yourself ?
because i am bound to a god and to a people and to a shepherd girl .
a shepherd girl ?
what can she be to you ?
unless the desert sun has dulled your senses .
does she ... grate garlic on her skin ?
or is it soft as mine ?
are her lips chafed and dry as the desert sand ?
or are they moist and red like a pomegranate ?
ls it the fragrance of myrrh that scents her hair ?
or is it the odour of sheep ?
there is a beauty beyond the senses , nefretiri .
beauty like the quiet of green valleys and still waters .
beauty whose spirit you cannot understand .
perhaps not .
but beauty of the spirit will not free your people , moses .
you will come to me or they will never leave egypt .
the fate of lsrael is not in your hands , nefretiri .
oh , isn t it ?
who else can soften pharaoh s heart ?
or harden it ?
yes .
you may be the lovely dust through which god will work his purpose .
fill every jar with water .
for seven days there will be none to drink .
but this well has never run dry .
and the river is high .
whose word is that ?
one who knows .
so fill your jars or go thirsty .
miriam is always right .
yes , l m going back for more jars .
yes , joshua .
she comes to the well every day .
wait and you will see her .
it is wise of dathan to send you to the well , lilia , or he might find his water poisoned .
they told me you were dead .
to all i love , joshua , i am dead .
dathan ?
yes .
dathan .
of your own free will ?
of my own free will .
you are no man s slave .
the hour of deliverance has come .
not for me , joshua .
hail to thee , great god of the nile !
thy waters are the blood of egypt .
hail to thee , maker of barley , feeder of cattle , carrier of ships , greatest of all the gods .
pharaoh of egypt !
you have not yet obeyed the lord .
let my people go !
the point of the sword ...
let him rave that men shall know him mad .
obey the lord or he will raise his hand against the waters of the river .
i have come to bless the waters , you have come to curse them .
we will learn if a shepherd god is stronger than the gods of pharaoh .
water of life , give drink to the desert and make green the meadow .
aaron .
stretch out my staff against the waters .
look !
where he s touched the river , it bleeds .
the water turns to blood !
blood flows from the god !
see how it spreads .
it ls blood !
that you may know the power of the lord , for seven days , egypt will thirst .
seven days without water !
pestilence will be everywhere !
were it seven times seven days , no magician s trick will set your people free .
sacred water , make pure the flood from which you came .
and god smote the land with all manner of plagues , but still pharaoh s heart was hardened .
great one , you hear the cry of egypt .
they would cry louder if they had to make the bricks .
send them away .
the people have been plagued by thirst , by frogs , by lice , by flies .
they can endure no more .
why do you bring this worker of evil before me ?
the people desert the temples and turn from the gods .
what gods ?
you prophets and priests made the gods , that you may prey upon the fears of men .
when the nile ran red , i too was afraid ... until word came of a mountain beyond the cataracts which spewed red mud and poisoned the water .
was it the staff that caused this ?
was it the wonder of your god that fish died and frogs left the water ?
was it a miracle that flies and lice should bloat upon their carrion and spread disease ?
these things were ordered by themselves , not by any god !
now go .
that you may know these things are done of god ...
you shall see hail fall from a clear sky and burn as fire upon the ground .
you shall see darkness cover egypt when the sun climbs high to noon .
and you shall know that god is god and bow down to his will .
nothing of this earth can make me bow to you , moses .
behold , the hail comes .
when darkness has covered egypt for three days , your ministers will send for me .
ln the three days of darkness , you have whined like frightened children in the night .
moses said the sun would shine in three days and it is true .
let his people go , or egypt will be barren from the cataracts to the sea .
will my father free the slaves ?
can taxes be collected from blighted harvests ?
does fear rule egypt ... or do l ?
we fear no army of the earth , but can we fight plagues with swords ?
there is no shame in this .
it is not pharaoh who yields to the slave , but his counsellors .
i have summoned moses at your request .
people will bless you , great one .
does the world bow to an empty throne ?
empty ?
does a pharaoh harden his heart against his son ?
lf you let the hebrews go , who will build hls cities ?
you told moses to make bricks without straw .
now he tells you to make cities without bricks !
who is the slave ... and who is the pharaoh ?
do you hear laughter , rameses ?
yes , the laughter of kings in babylon , in canaan , in troy ... as egypt surrenders to the god of slaves !
bring the hebrew in .
go into the garden .
lt s not good for a son of pharaoh to see his father humbled by a son of slaves .
my son , stand beside me .
have the days of darkness made you see the light , rameses ?
will you now free my people ?
great one , bid the scribe read the order .
give me the writing .
you cannot resist the power of his god !
i know not his god !
neither will i let his people go .
how long will you refuse to humble yourself before god ?
lf you bring another plague upon us , it is not your god but i who will turn the nile red with blood .
as your father s father did with the blood of our male children !
lf there is one more plague on egypt , it is by your word that god will bring it .
and there shall be so great a cry throughout the land that you will surely let the people go .
come to me no more , moses , for on the day you see my face again , you will surely die .
so let it be written .
i will give this spawn of slaves and his god an answer the world will not forget !
commander of the host , call on the chariots from talis .
there shall be one more plague ... only it will come upon the slaves of goshen !
first born of each house shall die , beginning with the son of moses .
you are the shepherd girl that moses married ?
the queen of egypt ls beautiful ... as he told me .
my husband is not here .
ls this moses son ?
yes , this is our son .
what do you want of us ?
you need have no fear of me .
i feared only his memory of you .
you have been able to erase it ?
he has forgotten both of us .
you lost him when he went to seek his god .
i lost him when he found his god .
at least he left you a son to cherish .
i am here to save his son .
from what ?
from pharaoh s decree that the first born of lsrael must die .
die ?
god of abraham !
don t let him do this !
not to the children !
a caravan for midian awaits you and your son .
my chariot will take you to it .
l m surprised you noticed me .
you didn t at the palace this morning .
why ?
were you afraid to look at me ?
what do you want , nefretiri ?
you , moses .
everything about us is coming to an end !
you will destroy egypt or egypt will destroy you .
i belong to you , moses .
she s gone with your son to midian .
why did she leave ?
she knew you d try to save the other children before your own son .
from what ?
rameses is massing the libyan axemen , the chariots , sardinian swordsmen .
why ?
tell me why !
to destroy the first born of lsrael .
oh , god !
my god !
out of his own mouth comes thy judgement !
but i have saved your son !
it is not my son who will die !
it is the first born of egypt !
your son , nefretiri !
you would not dare strike pharaoh s son !
ln the hardness of his heart , pharaoh brings death to his own son !
but he s my son , moses .
you would not harm my son ?
i , myself , am nothing .
god s power uses me to work his will .
you would not let him do this to me .
i saved your son .
i cannot save yours .
your god listens to you , moses .
about midnight , the destroyer will come into the midst of egypt and all the first born shall die , from the first born of pharaoh to the first born of his servants .
when you were prince of egypt , you held me in your arms .
when you were a condemned slave ,
i threw myself at your feet before the court of pharaoh .
because i loved you , moses .
it is the lord who executes judgement , nefretiri .
go back to your son .
your love for me is stronger than the power of any god .
you will not kill my son .
turn from thy fierce wrath , o lord !
# death cometh to me
# to set me free
# death cometh to me ... #
no , lilia , death will not come to you .
joshua !
joshua , you risk your life in coming here .
you are first born .
so are you .
i bring lamb s blood to mark the doorposts and lintel ... that the angel of death may pass you by .
joshua , it is enough that you have come to me .
i am outcast among our people .
don t save me from death , joshua , save me from life .
tomorrow will bring a new world .
no !
and no blood on this door !
dathan , it will save her life !
moses has god s promise !
moses has words , pharaoh has spears .
remember , joshua , of her own free will she s mine .
# he shall cover thee with his feathers
# and under his wing shalt thou trust # though we stand in the shadow of death , the lord is our god .
the lord is one .  the lord is one .
# his truth shall be thy shield ... # shield us through this night of terror , o king of the universe .
why is everyone afraid ?
why is this night different from all others ?
because this night the lord will free us from the bondage of egypt .
# thou shalt not be afraid of the terror by night #
pharaoh s soldiers !
or worse !
# or from the arrow that flyeth by day #
bithiah !
ln fear of your god they have set me free .
may a stranger enter ?
there are no strangers among those who seek god s mercy .
my bearers ?
all who thirst for freedom may come with us .
the darkness of death will pass over us tonight .
tomorrow the light of freedom will shine upon us as we go forth from egypt .
i shall go with you , moses .
a princess of egypt !
from the house of pharaoh !
an idol worshipper !
this woman drew me from the nile and set my feet upon the path of knowledge .
mered , bring a chair for pharaoh s daughter .
there is a great light shines from your face .
perhaps some day i shall understand it .
he is god s messenger , princess .
lf it is not forbidden to look upon the breath of pestilence , then see , for it is here .
do not look , eleazar .
close the door , joshua , and let death pass .
will it pass , moses ?
will it pass ?
that is god s promise , elisheba .
blessed art thou , o lord our god who bringeth forth bread from the earth .
run !
run !
there shall no evil befall you ... or any plagues come near you .
# a thousand shall fall at thy sight #
why do we eat unleavened bread and bitter herbs ?
faster !
take the other road !
the herbs remind us of the bitterness of captivity , eleazar .
this is the bread of haste , that you will remember this night from generation to generation forever .
give me back my baby !
they are my people !
all are god s people .
death is all around us !
but it passes those who have believed the lord .
always remember , eleazar ... he passed over your house .
are the captains of egypt afraid of a night mist ?
the death cry is everywhere .
some devil s curse !
look !
l ve known battle for 30 years , pharaoh , but never fear till tonight .
aide .
have the captains join their men .
at the coming of dawn we will strike .
no first born hebrew shall live .
let the hebrews go , great one , or we are all dead men .
he was your son ?
my first born .
there is no magic cure , no spell to use .
he is the first born of pharaoh .
we have no skill before this ... pestilence .
my father .
my son .
your own curse is on him .
where did you hear this ?
from moses .
i would not let his people go because your serpent s tongue hardened my heart .
you only thought to keep moses here .
you cared nothing for my throne ... or my son .
i asked moses for his life .
the shadow of death is on his face .
no ...
he will not die .
captain .
take my fastest chariot .
bring moses to me .
i will bring him , mighty pharaoh .
he s my only son .
you have conquered , moses .
the foot of a slave is on the neck of egypt .
you were saved from the nile to be a curse upon me .
your shadow fell between me and my father , between me and my fame , between me and my queen .
your shadow now fills all things with death .
go out from among us , you and your people .
i set you free .
it is not by your word , nor by my hand that we are free , pharaoh .
the power of god has freed us .
enough of your words !
take your people , your cattle , your god and your pestilence .
take what spoils from egypt you will !
but go !
o lord god ... with a strong hand thou dost bring us out of bitter bondage .
tomorrow we go forth a free nation .
for every man shall reap what he has sown and bow no knee except in prayer .
we will go with our young and with our old , with our sons and with our daughters ...
with our flocks and with our herds will we go , for i know that the lord is great and that our lord is above all gods .
he s dead .
soca , great lord of the lower world ...
i , who have denied the gods of egypt , bow before you now .
show that you have power above the god of moses , and restore the life he has taken from my son .
guide back his soul across the lake of death to the place of living men , and i will raise a temple to you mightier than the pyramids .
hear me , dread lord of darkness ...
arise , o lsrael !
behold the dawn of freedom !
and it came to pass , after the stifling night of terror , came a day such as the world had never seen . from east and west , from north and south , they came with all they had , driving their flocks and their herds and their camels before them . by tens , by hundreds , by thousands , unending streams of man and beast and burden , and even very much cattle , poured into the avenue of sphinxes . beneath the stone feet of the four colossal images of rameses , which their own sweat and blood and sinew had hewn from solid rock , a nation arose and freedom was born into the world .
father , have you got rebekka ?
no , i haven t got rebekka .
here s the trough .
sling it on your shoulders .
this is a blessed day !
here s rebekka !
thank you !
can we take the cow ?
we re moving to the gates .
rachel , help me with this brick yoke .
don t forget the oil for the baths !
where are we going ?
to some land flowing with milk and honey !
l ve never tasted honey .
anybody know the way ?
lt s away from the whip !
freedom will wet your throats in the desert .
this is the governor s house !
you cannot enter .
out !
all of you !
why do soldiers come here ?
i put no blood on my door .
then stone bleeds !
your stonecutter did this to me !
all your gold cannot wipe that mark from your door ... or from my heart .
for that , you il walk all the way to ...
where are we going ?
do you know where we re going ?
to hell , i hope !
like dathan , they did not know where they were going , and cared no more than their flocks . now they used the brick yokes for a very different burden . there went forth among them planters of vineyards and sowers of seeds , each hoping to sit under his own vine and fig tree . out of this glorious chaos , it is joshua who brings order and purpose .
set the standard of each tribe before the people !
levite in the centre , judah to the right , hephron left .
go !
watch where you re going !
watch out for my geese !
# joseph was jacob s son
# many colours was his coat ... #
aaron and the elders are carrying a shrouded body , grandfather !
they are the bones of joseph , to rest in his own land .
nubians , grandfather !
here come treasure wagons !
spoils of egypt .
all who shared the toil will share this gold !
here , boy !
for the blind one !
a little golden calf , grandfather , with horns !
an idol .
for idol worshippers !
there are the fire bearers !
plant your fires at night beside the standards , that all may light their torches !
eleazar , hang this on the wagon .
now the cradle ...
joshua !
joshua !
i have wagons for midwives and physicians .
place them at 5, 000 cubits ...
l il pay you back every lash you gave me , dathan !
ls this a day for hard feelings ?
l ve felt your whip !
lilia is no slave , dathan !
you can carry your own carton .
let her ride !
so , now , my brother , we have new task masters .
we serve no masters now !
yes , but not for long .
here .
old woman .
that s it .
joshua !
make way for the governor !
you know who i am .
i know who you were .
go and tell rameses l m coming back to my house .
that rabble may follow moses into the desert today , but when their eyes are seared red by the sun and their cracked lips bleed with thirst , when their stomachs cramp with hunger , they will curse the name of moses and his god .
then i will lead them back to pharaoh and the brick pits .
there are so many .
so many .
how shall i find thy road through the wilderness , lord ?
how shall i find water in the desert for this multitude ?
moses ... the people are assembled .
then let us go forth to the mountain of god , that he may write his commandments in our minds and hearts forever .
we march , praising his mighty name !
what is the word , joshua ?
let the trumpets sound !
hear , o lsrael !
remember this day , when the strong hand of the lord leads you out of bondage !
the lord is our god !
the lord is one !
the lord is our god !
the lord is one !
come on !
come on !
yes !
come on !
joshua !
400 years in bondage and today he won t move !
# the lord is one !
praise to god ...
# thank thee , o lord ... #
my litter can carry him .
i am poured out like water , my strength dried up into the dust ... of death .
we shall plant your fig tree !
children shall eat of its fruit !
do you hear that ?
you have a strong new son !
and he brought forth the people with joy and gladness . he bore them out of egypt as an eagle bears its young upon its wings . but again ...
pharaoh s heart was hardened .
how many more days and nights will you pray ?
does he hear you ?
dread lord of darkness , are you not greater than the god of moses ?
i have raised my voice to you , yet life has not come to the body of my son .
hear me !
he cannot hear you .
he s nothing but a piece of stone with the head of a bird .
he wlll hear me .
i am egypt .
egypt ?
you are nothing .
you let moses kill my son .
no god can bring him back .
what have you done to moses ?
how did he die ?
did he cry for mercy when you tortured him ?
bring me to his body !
i want to see it , rameses !
i want to see it !
this is my son .
he would have been pharaoh .
he would have ruled the world .
who mourns him now ?
not even you .
all you can think of is moses .
you will not see his body .
i drove him out of egypt .
i cannot fight the power of his god .
hls god ?
the priests say that pharaoh is a god , but you are not a god , you are even less than a man .
listen to me , rameses , you thought i was evil when i went to moses , and you were right .
shall i tell you what happened , rameses ?
he spurned me , like a strumpet in the street .
i , nefretiri , queen of egypt !
all that you wanted from me he would not even take .
do you hear laughter , pharaoh ?
not the laughter of kings , but the laughter of slaves on the desert !
laughter ?
laughter ?
my son , i shall build your tomb upon their crushed bodies !
lf any escape , their seed shall be scattered and accursed forever !
my armour .
war crown .
laughter ?
i will turn the laughter of these slaves into wails of torment !
they shall remember the name of moses , only that he died under my chariot wheels !
kill him with your own hands .
let the trumpet sound .
alert the watch towers .
assemble all the chariots at the city gate .
i obey !
ready my chariot .
i will bring you back your temple treasure !
bring it back to me stained with his blood .
i will !
to mingle with your own !
salute !
hail !
hail !
remember your first born !
death to the slaves !
death to the slaves !
death to their god !
death to their god !
hail !
forward !
do you hear thunder ?
over the sea ?
no , it comes from the desert .
that s the thunder of horses !
look !
pharaoh s chariot !
we re trapped against the sea !
caleb , warn the north tents !
joshua ?
that s joshua s horn !
all men to the pass !
get horses , wagons !
form a barrier !
what s the alarm ?
pharaoh s chariot !
block the pass with carts !
women and children , to the sea !
bring shovels !
mallets !
hear me !
hear me !
can mallets stop arrows ?
will your cart stop pharaoh s chariots ?
women , do you want your men killed ?
moses !
pharaoh s chariots !
l ve ordered men to block the pass !
we can t fight chariots !
order the men to move back , joshua .
move back ?
where ? lnto the sea ?
lnto the hand of god .
deliverer ?
he s delivered you to death !
look !
look !
blame moses for this !
deliver him to pharaoh !
yes !
yes !
stone him !
the god of moses is a poor general ... to leave him no retreat .
ten times you have seen the miracles of the lord !
and still you have no faith !
he delivers you to death !
stone him !
stone him !
listen to moses !
he speaks god s will !
they will stop for me !
a chariot knows no rank .
was it because there where no graves in egypt that you took us to die in the wilderness ?
fear not !
stand still and see the salvation of the lord !
a pillar of fire !
the work of god !
through it !
no , great one !
you cannot breach the fire of god !
gather your families and flocks .
we must go with all speed .
go where ?
to drown in the sea ?
how long can the fire hold ?
after this day you shall see his chariots no more !
no !
you il be dead under them !
the lord of hosts will do battle for us !
behold his mighty hand !
the wind opens the sea !
god opens the sea with the blast of his nostrils !
lead them through the waters .
his will be done !
he opens the waters for them and he bars our way with fire .
let us go .
men cannot fight a god !
better to die in battle with a god , than live in shame .
praise god and down into it !
god has delivered us !
help us !
never mind the wheel !
pull !
pull for your lives !
ls your life worth so much ?
# .. jacob s son many colours was his coat ...
# god of lsrael ... #
save the bread if you can !
bring caleb to help with the wagons !
moses !
stand on the rock where the people can see you and have hope !
above us !
the fire dies !
sound the pursuit !
chariots , halt !
this is work for a butcher , not a pharaoh .
destroy them all .
but bring moses to me alive .
level spears !
forward !
oh !
here !
take him !
wait !
wait !
grandfather , look , the horses are coming !
the chariots !
run !
run !
better to serve than to die here !
who shall withstand the power of god ?
thou didst blow with thy winds and the sea covered them !
who is like unto thee , o lord ?
from everlasting to everlasting ... thou art god !
the lord is one !
the lord is one !
before you strike ... show me his blood on your sword .
you couldn t even kill him .
his god ... ls god .
and moses led lsrael from the red sea into the wilderness of sinai . and they camped before the holy mountain . and when the people saw that moses delayed to come down out of the mountain , they gathered together .
could anyone live on that summit for 40 days and nights ?
yes !
by the will of god !
who knows the will of god ?
do you ?
do l ?
or you , sephora ?
his grieving wife .
she came back to find her husband .
but even she cannot hope he lives !
moses went up into the forbidden ground to receive god s law !
but he s not returned !
we share your pain .
we sympathise .
but will sympathy lead us to this land flowing with milk and honey ?
now we have no leader !
moses wlll return ... aah !
would a god who s shown you such wonders
let moses die before his work is done ?
his mother !
so beautiful is the hope of a mother !
but there are other mothers among you !
what will become of your children ?
we must have faith !
faith in what ?
you , aaron ?
can you lead us to this land of promise ?
do you know where it is ?
across the wilderness !
then who is to lead us ?
you , dathan !
where could i bring you but egypt ?
where there is death ?
no !
where there is food !
pharaoh would kill us .
not with a god of egypt before us !
make one , aaron .
aaron knows the art of the temple !
i will not !
he will not !
he would rather see our flesh rot in the wilderness .
you wlll make a god for us !
a god of gold !
a golden calf !
korah shall be the high priest !
bring baskets !
buckets !
shawls !
anything you have !
take off your earrings , your bracelets , your necklaces ...
aaron will make us a golden calf !
the gold we took from egypt !
there !
from the burning bush , o lord , you charged me to bring the people to this holy mountain , to behold your glory and receive your law .
what have i left undone ?
l am ... l am ... l am the lord thy god . thou shalt have no other gods before me .
thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image .
and they overlaid the image with pure gold . and aaron fashioned it and smoothed it with the hammer , ready to be graven by cunning art and man s device . and he fastened it with nails that it should not move . and he that smote the anvil did beat the molten gold into thin plates . for they had gathered their treasure into the midst of the furnace , and did blow the fire upon it to melt it . and they adorned themselves in rich apparel and costly array , veils of blue , purple and scarlet , and fine linen wrought in egypt . and the women tread grapes into new wine .  thou shall not take the name of the lord thy god in vain .
remember the sabbath day , to keep it holy .
honour thy father and thy mother .
thou shalt not kill .
and the people sinned a great sin , for they had made them a god of gold . and they bore him upon their shoulders and rejoiced , saying , this be our god , o lsrael .
are you mourners of moses afraid to face the new god ? then they were as children who have lost their faith . they were perverse and crooked and rebellious against god .
they did eat the bread of wickedness , and drank the wine of violence , and did evil in the eyes of the lord . and the people cried , the graven image hath brought us joy ,  and they worshipped the golden calf and sacrificed unto it .
here is your sacrifice !
thou shalt not commit adultery .
thou shalt not steal .
thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour .
thou shalt not covet anything that is thy neighbour s .
written with the finger of god .
go !
get thee down , for thy people have corrupted themselves .
and the people rose up to play and did eat and drink . they were as the children of fools and cast off their clothes . the wicked were like a troubled sea whose waters cast up mire and dirt . they sank from evil to evil and were viler than the earth . and there was rioting and drunkenness , for they had become servants of sin . there was manifest all manner of ungodliness and works of the flesh . even adultery and lasciviousness , uncleanness , idolatry and rioting , vanity and wrath . and they were filled with iniquity and vile affections . and aaron knew that he had brought them to shame .
abiram !
korah !
bind the sacrifice with cord !
even unto the horns of the altar !
the light of god shines from you , moses .
do not kneel to me , joshua .
these tablets of stone ...
the writing of god .
his ten commandments .
there is a noise of war in the camp .
it is not the noise of war .
it is the noise of song and revelry .
moses !
joshua !
woe unto thee , oh lsrael .
you have sinned a great sin in the sight of god !
you are not worthy to receive these ten commandments .
aaron !
we are gathered against you , moses !
you take too much upon yourself !
we will not live by your commandments .
we are free !
there is no freedom without the law .
whose law ?
yours ?
did you carve the tablets to become a prince over us ?
who is on the lord s side ...
let him come to me !
i am !
moses !
moses !
you have cursed us .
these people made me .
joshua !
joshua !
he showed you no milk and honey !
i show you a god of gold !
come with me !
follow me !
blasphemers ! ldolaters !
for this you shall drink bitter waters !
god has set before you this day his laws of life and good and death and evil .
those who will not live by the law ... shall die by the law !
and the lord s anger was kindled against lsrael . and to prove whether they would keep his commandments or no , he made them wander in the wilderness 40 years , until the generation that had done evil in the sight of the lord was consumed . but moses eye was not dim , nor his natural force abated . and he went up from the plains of moab unto the mountains , and the lord showed him all the land that was beyond the river jordan .
the lord was angry with me because i disobeyed him by the waters of strife .
and he said unto me , behold the new land with thine eyes . thou shalt not cross over this river jordan .
then i shall stay .
i am called by the lord , sephora .
i go alone .
look , moses .
the people have come to the river jordan .
ln the ark they carry the law you brought them .
you taught them not to live by bread alone .
you are god s torch , that lights the way to freedom .
i love you .
joshua ...
joshua , i charge you and strengthen you , for you shall go over jordan to lead the people .
as for me and my house , we shall serve the lord .
mered , give me the books .
eleazar ... set these five books in the ark of the covenant , by the tablets of the ten commandments , which the lord restored unto us .
go .
proclaim liberty throughout all the lands , unto all the inhabitants thereof .
