yeah , ok .
blonde' s fine .
well , that' s what they say .
the discount inn .
304 .
leonard .
well , what then ?
we just go to bed .
you wait for me to fall asleep .
you go into the bathroom and slam the door .
slam it ?
yeah .
loud enough to wake me up .
and that' s it ?
that' s it .
ah ...
yeah , first i just need you to put these things around the room .
pretend they' re your things and this is your bedroom .
should i wear it ?
no , no , no .
uh , just like you took it off .
i don' t want you to use it .
i' m sorry .
i just mean put them around the room , as if they were your ... your things .
whatever gets you off .
i can' t blame the cops for not taking me seriously .
this is a difficult condition to understand .
look at sammy jankis .
his own wife couldn' t deal with it .
i told you how she tried to get him to snap out of it .
she came to see me at the office .
i found out all kinds of shit .
she told me about life with sammy .
how she treated him .
thank you for seeing me .
she' d get sammy to hide food around the house ... ... then she' d stop feeding him to see if his hunger would make him remember .
i' ve taken him to a parking lot and , uh ... she wasn' t a cruel person .
she just wanted her old sammy back .
you know all about sammy and you' ve decided he' s faking .
the company' s position isn' t that sammy' s faking anything ... ... just that his condition can' t be shown to be ...
i just want to know your honest opinion about sammy .
we shouldn' t be talking like this while the case is still open to appeal .
i' m not appealing the decision .
then why are you here ?
try to understand , when i look at sammy , i don' t see some ... vegetable .
i see my same old sammy .
what do you think that' s like for me ... ... to suspect that he might be imagining this whole problem ?
that if i just could say the right thing ... ... he' d snap out of it and go back to being normal .
if i ...
if i knew that my old sammy were truly gone ... ... then i could say goodbye and start loving this new sammy .
as long as i have doubt i can' t say goodbye and move on .
what do you want from me ?
i want you to forget the company you work for for thirty seconds ... ... and tell me if you really believe that sammy' s faking his condition .
i need to know ... ... what you honestly believe .
i believe that sammy should be physically capable of making new memories .
thank you .
i thought i' d helped her .
i thought she just needed an answer .
i didn' t think it was important what it was .
just that she had one to believe .
a car this nice you should lock .
who the fuck are you ?
teddy , your buddy .
prove it !
remember sammy ?
you told me about sammy !
jeez !
what the fuck are you doing in my car ?
what , your sense of humour went with the memory ?
do you know why you' re here ?
unfinished business .
lenny ... ... let me inform you , your business here is very much finished .
you' re still here because of natalie .
who' s natalie ?
schmuck !
whose house do you think you just walked out of ?
that' s right , take a look at your pictures .
i bet you got one of her .
oh , nice shot , leibovitz
you' il want to make a note .
you can' t trust her .
why' s that ?
because by now she' s taken a look at the suit and the car ... ... and she' s figuring out ways of turning the situation to her advantage .
she' s already got you staying with her , for christ sakes .
you can' t go back there .
let me give you the name of a motel .
you' re lucky i ran into you .
that broad' s bad news .
what do you mean , " bad news " ?
she' s involved with drugs .
look .
see these ?
this is the bar where she works .
her boyfriend' s a drug dealer .
she takes orders for him , arranges meets .
he writes messages on the back of these ... ... then she slips him the answers when she serves him his drinks .
why should i care ?
because when she gets jammed up ... ... she' s gonna use you to protect herself .
from who ?
guys are gonna wanna know what happened to her boyfriend .
guys are gonna come after her .
somebody' s got to pay , lenny .
somebody always pays .
maybe she' il make it you .
oh , yeah ?
well , maybe she' il make it you .
is that it ?
you worried that she' s gonna use me against you ?
no .
why not ?
because she doesn' t know who i am .
why are you following me ?
maybe i wanna help .
she doesn' t know anything about your investigation .
ok , einstein ?
so write this down .
when she offers to help , it' il be for her own reasons .
i' m not lying .
take my pen , write this down .
do not trust her .
there .
you happy now ?
i won' t be happy until you leave town .
why not ?
you ever wonder how long you can hang around here ... ... before people start asking questions ?
what sort of questions ?
the same questions you should be asking yourself .
like what ?
like how did you get this suit , the car ?
i have money .
from what ?
my wife' s death .
i used to work in insurance .
we were well covered .
oh !
so in your grief you wandered into a jaguar dealership ?
you don' t have a clue , do you ?
you don' t even know who you are .
yes , i do .
i don' t have amnesia .
i remember everything right up until the incident .
i am leonard shelby , i am from san francisco ...
that' s who you were .
you do not know who you are .
what you' ve become since ... ... the incident .
you wander around playing detective .
you don' t even know how long ago it was .
let me put it this way .
were you wearing designer suits when you sold insurance ?
i didn' t sell insurance , i investigated it .
right , right .
you' re an investigator .
maybe you should investigate yourself .
oh , thank you for the advice .
look , do me a favour , don' t go back in there .
will you take the motel out of town ?
it' s been fun , lenny .
do not trust her .
don' t believe his lies .
oh , fuck it .
i need my own place .
no .
she shouldn' t have given me that responsibility .
i' m a claims investigator , not a doctor .
yeah , yeah , i guess .
i' ve got all sorts of other considerations .
legal responsibility , large financ ...
who is this ?
write this down .
write down what happened .
write it down .
come on , concentrate .
keep it in mind .
find a p ...

you' re safe .
it' s ok .
come on .
just sit down .
sit down .
here , sit down .

you' re ok .
i' il just get some ice for your face .
here .
i did exactly what you told me to do .
i went to dodd ... ... and i told him that i didn' t have any of jimmy' s money ... ... or the drugs .
and that this teddy must have taken everything .
and what did he say ?
he didn' t believe me .
he said if i don' t have the drugs by tomorrow , he' s gonna kill me .
and then he just ... he just started hitting me .
where is he ?
why ?
i' il go see him .
i' il give him some bruises of his own and tell him to look for a guy called teddy .
oh , he' il kill you , lenny .
my wife used to call me lenny .
yeah ?
yeah , i hated it .
oh , this guy is so dangerous .
let' s just think of something else , ok ?
no , no , no .
you just tell me what he looks like .
and where i can find him .
have you got a pen ?
in my purse .
he' il , um ... he' il probably find you .
what do you mean ?

no , none at all .
what' s wrong ?
somebody' s come already .
who ?
calls himself dodd .
what does he want ?
wants to know what happened to jimmy and his money .
he thinks i took it .
did you ?
no .
what' s this all about ?
you don' t have a fucking clue , do you ?
you' re just blissfully ignorant , aren' t you ?
look , i have this condition .
i know all about your fucking condition !
i probably know more about it than you , you don' t have a clue about anything else .
what happened ?
jimmy went to meet a guy named teddy .
he took a lot of money with him and never came back .
jimmy' s partners think i set him up .
i don' t know if you know this teddy .
neither do i.
don' t protect him !
help me .
how ?
get rid of dodd for me .
what ?
kill him .
i' il pay you .
what do you think i am ?
i' m not gonna kill someone for money .
what , then ?
love ?
what would you kill for ?
you' d kill for your wife , wouldn' t you ?
that' s different .
not to me , i wasn' t married to her !
hey , don' t talk about my wife .
i can talk about whoever the fuck i want !
i can say whatever i want and you won' t remember !
i can call your wife a fucking whore and we can still be friends .
calm down .

i' m telling you now because i' m gonna enjoy it much more ... ... if i know that you could stop me if you weren' t such a fucking freak .
did you lose your pen ?
too bad , freak .
otherwise you could write yourself a note about how much natalie hates your guts ... ... and that i called your wife a whore !
don' t say another fucking word !
about your whore of a wife ?
i read about your condition , leonard .
you know one of the causes of short term memory loss ?
venereal disease .
maybe your cunt of a fucking wife ... ... sucked one too many diseased cocks and turned you into a retard !
you sad , sad freak .
i can say whatever the fuck i want and you won' t remember .
we' il still be best friends .
or maybe even lovers .

what does it look like ?
he beat the shit out of me .
who ?
who ?
fuck , leonard , dodd !
dodd beat the shit out of me .
hello ?
it' s burt , from the front desk .
yeah ?
i know you said you didn' t want any calls but this guy on the phone says he' s a cop .
a cop ?
yeah .
he says you' re really gonna wanna know what he has to say .
i' m not too good on the phone .
i need to look people in the eye .
well , what ...
you can , um , you can crash on the couch .
it' s comfortable .
just have a seat .
thanks .
so , how long do you think it' s gonna take you ?
hm ?
you told me you were looking for the guy who killed your wife .
oh , it depends on if he' s here in town or if he' s moved on .
i have my file here .
can i ask you something ?
if you have all that information , why haven' t the police found him for you ?
they' re not looking for him .
why not ?
they don' t think he exists .
you see , i told them what i remembered .
i was asleep .
something woke me up .
her side of the bed was cold .
she' d obviously been gone for a while .
there had to be a second man .
somebody hit me from behind .
i remember .
it' s the last thing i do remember .
look , the police didn' t believe me .
if we check ...
how did they explain what you do remember ?
the gun and stuff ?
john g was clever .
he was clever .
he took the dead man' s gun and replaced it with the sap he hit me with .
he left my gun and the getaway car .
he gave the police a complete package .
they found the sap with my blood on it in the dead man' s hand .
and they only found my gun .
they didn' t need to look for anybody else .
i was the only guy who disagreed with the facts and i had brain damage .
the cops are not gonna believe someone in my condition .
leonard .
you can stay here for a couple of days if it will help you .
oh , thanks .
i have to go back to work , so , um , just make yourself at home .
you can watch tv or have some food .
whatever you want , ok ?
make yourself at home .
one thing .
something to remember you by .
my name is natalie .
natalie .
what' s wrong ?
somebody' s come already .
on the house .
thanks .
my , you really do have a problem .
just like that cop said .
hm ?
your condition .
well , nobody' s perfect .
what' s the last thing that you " do " remember ?
my wife .
that' s sweet .
dying .
i remember my wife dying .
let me , um , get you another one .
i think this one' s dusty .
why are you calling me ?
what do you want ?
i know you' re a cop .
what do you want ?
have i done something wrong ?
i don' t know , something bad , maybe .
look , why are you asking me ?
i can' t remember what i' ve done .
you wouldn' t believe me anyway .
because of my condition , you don' t believe someone with this condition .
nobody believed sammy !
i didn' t even fucking believe sammy !
ferdy' s bar .
come by after .
natalie .
a beer , please .
what do you want ?
a beer , please .
you can' t just waltz in here dressed like that and ask for a beer .
what , is there a dress code ?
why are you here ?
i' m meeting someone called natalie .
well , that' s me .
yeah , we met before , right ?
then why am i here ?
i don' t know , why don' t you tell me ?
i don' t remember .
i have no short term memory .
oh , you' re that memory guy .
how do you know about me ?
my boyfriend told me about you .
oh , yeah ?
who' s your boyfriend ?
jimmy grants .
do you know him ?
no .
he knows you .
he told me about you .
he said you were staying at the discount .
in fact , a cop came by earlier and was looking for you .
said he was looking for a guy who can' t remember anything ... ... wouldn' t know how he' d got here or what he' d done .
i get a lot of guys round here like that .
chronic alcoholism is one cause of short term memory loss .
are you teddy ?
no , my name' s leonard .
did teddy send you ?
i don' t know .
what' s happened to jimmy ?
i don' t know that , either .
sorry .
you don' t remember anything ?
you don' t remember where you' ve been or what you' ve just done ?
i can' t make new memories .
everything just fades .
then why did you come here ?
i found this in my pocket .
your pocket ?
bar bet .
care to contribute ?
no , thanks .
it' s for a lot of money .
come on .
proceeds are going to charity .
help me out .
thank you .
on the house .
thanks .
it' s completely fucked because nobody believes you .
it' s amazing what a little brain damage will do for your credibility .
i guess it' s poetic justice for not believing sammy .
you know the truth about my condition , officer ?
you don' t know anything .
you feel angry , you don' t know why .
you feel guilty , you have no idea why .
you could do anything and not have the faintest idea ten minutes later .
like sammy .
what if i' d done something like sammy ?
i didn' t tell you ?
what happened to sammy and his wife ?
she came to see me at my office .
i didn' t tell her what i really thought but i never said that he was faking .
just that his condition was mental , not physical .
i found out later that she went home and gave sammy his final exam .
sammy ?
it' s time for my shot .
she knew beyond a doubt that he loved her , so she found a way to test him .
sammy ?
it' s time for my shot .
hm .
she really thought she' d call his bluff .
there you go .
or she just didn' t want to live with the things she' d put him through .
sammy ?
it' s time for my shot .
it won' t hurt .
she went into a coma and never recovered .
sammy couldn' t understand or explain what happened .
oh !
he' s been in a home ever since .
he doesn' t even know his wife is dead .
i was wrong about sammy and i was wrong about his wife .
she wasn' t interested in the money .
she needed to understand his problem .
his brain didn' t respond to conditioning but he wasn' t a con man .
and when she looked into his eyes , she thought he could be the same person .
when i looked into his eyes , i thought i saw recognition .
now i know you fake it .
if you think you' re supposed to recognise somebody , you pretend to .
you bluff it to get a pat on the head from the doctors .
you bluff it to seem less of a freak .
what drug dealer ?
hey , lenny , how you doing ?
it' s private back here .
it' s ok , we know each other .
right , kid ?
how did you know i was in here ?
the jag' s out front .
what are you still doing here , lenny ?
there' s plenty of tattoo parlours up north .
i guess i wanted to get something down before it slipped my mind .
give me the keys , i' il move it .
it' il be all right .
wait out there .
oh , for christ ...
give me a minute , i' ve got to get something for you .
fact six .
car licence sg13 7iu .
look , wait a minute , will ya ?
we gotta get you out of here .
why ?
oh , man .
come on , leonard .
how many times i gotta tell you ?
it' s not safe for you to hang around .
why not ?
because that cop' s looking for you .
i gotta get you a new identity ... ... some new clothes , a different car would do for now .
put these on .
whoa , whoa .
what cop ?
he' s a bad cop .
he' s the one that checked you into the discount inn .
he' s been calling you for days , slipping envelopes under your door , shit like that .
how do you know this ?
he told me .
he' s been laughing at you .
you' re full of shit .
no , i' m not .
he knows you' re no good on the phone so he' s been calling you up .
sometimes you don' t answer the phone ... ... so he slips shit under your door to scare you into answering it ... ... giving you a line of crap about john g being a local drug dealer .
jimmy grants .
who' s jimmy grants ?
leonard , jimmy' s the drug dealer .
the cop wants to know how his operation is run .
he' s got some score in mind .
somehow you' re involved .
how do you know him ?
i' m a snitch .
he' s a cop from out of town .
the local boys put us together .
if he knew i was helping you , he' d fucking kill me .
so take these clothes , put them on and get the fuck out of here .
come on , leonard , just go .
you " are " full of shit .
come by after .
natalie .
ferdy' s bar .
hey , jimmy .
i' m sorry , i , uh , thought you were somebody else .
sorry .
that' s ok .
this jimmy grants deals drugs out of the bar where his girlfriend works ?
but he' s not going to bring her along ?
he' il come by himself , right ?
i always figured the drugs angle would be the best way to get him .
no , officer .
i' m as ready as i' il ever be .
you' re in the lobby ?
what do you look like ?
i' il be right there .
lenny !
officer gammell ?
yeah .
come on .
hey , smile .
oh , don' t , uh ...

you know what ?
don' t write gammell , just teddy .
why ?
i' m undercover .
this is the directions , where he' s going .
my number' s on the bottom if you ...

nah , it wouldn' t be appropriate .

my associates are not the kind of people you wanna piss off .

i don' t wanna get blood on them .
whoa , whoa , whoa !
wait , wait , wait !
did he tell you what i was bringing ?
take your fuckin ' pants off !
i' ve got two hundred grand in the car !

you think you can bargain with me ?
just take the money and walk away .
i don' t want your fucking money .
then , what ?
what do you want from me ?
i want my fucking life back !
sammy .
he said sammy .
how does he know about sammy ?
oh , fuck .
what have i done ?
hey , mister !
i need help !
there' s a guy in here , he' s hurt bad .
we gotta get him to a doctor .
all right .
i don' t know what happened .
i' ve got this memory thing .
do i know you ?
no .
don' t worry , i' m a cop .
is he still breathing ?
well , i don' t know .
maybe .
what the hell were you guys doing ?
i don' t remember , i have this condition .
i hope it' s not as serious as his cos this guy' s dead .
ow !
lenny !
that shit kills !
so you remember me now , huh ?
you " are " a fucking cop !
and i' m the guy that helped you find him .
get up !
get up !
lenny , you got the wrong idea !
who is that ?
he knew me .
of course he did , he raped your wife , he fucked up your brain .
bullshit !
he' s not the guy .
his name is james f grants .
john g. check your tattoos .
why did he bring two hundred grand ?
what ?
what was it for ?
amphetamines i told him i had .
is this a drug deal ?
no .
yeah , that and your thing .
look , jimmy' s your guy .
i figured we' d make a few dollars on the side .
how did he know me ?
the discount inn .
he dealt out of there .
the guy at the front desk let him know if anybody came round .
he called jimmy the minute he saw you taking a picture .
you' re fucking using me .
no !
you get half .
he knew about sammy , why would i tell him about sammy ? !
you tell everybody about sammy !
everybody who' il listen !
remember sammy jankis ?
remember sammy jankis ?
great story .
gets better every time you tell it .
so you lie to yourself to be happy .
there' s nothing wrong with that .
we all do it .
who cares if there' s a few little details you' d rather not remember ?
what the fuck are you talking about ?
i don' t know .
your wife surviving the assault .
her not believing your condition .
the torment and pain and anguish tearing her up inside .
the insulin .
that' s sammy , not me .
i told you about sammy .
yeah , right .
like you tell yourself over and over again .
condtitioning yourself to remember , learning through repetition .
sammy let his wife kill herself .
sammy ended up in an institution .
sammy was a con man .
a faker .
i never said that sammy was faking .
you exposed him for what he was .
a fraud .
i was wrong .
that' s the whole point .
see , sammy' s wife came to me ...
sammy didn' t have a wife .
it was your wife who had diabetes .
ouch !
my wife wasn' t diabetic .
you sure ?
ouch !
cut it out !
she wasn' t diabetic .
you think i don' t know my own wife ?
what the fuck is wrong with you ?
i guess i can only make you remember the things you want to be true .
like old jimmy down there .
he' s not the right guy .
he was to you .
come on , you got your revenge .
enjoy it while you still remember .
what difference does it make whether he was your guy or not ?
it makes all the difference .
why ?
you' re never gonna know .
yes , i will .
no , you won' t .
somehow i' il know .
you won' t remember !
when it' s done , i will know .
i thought so , too , i was sure of it , but you didn' t !
that' s right .
the real john g. i helped you find him over a year ago .
he' s already dead .
don' t lie to me any more .
look , lenny ... ... i was the cop assigned to your wife' s case , i believed you .
i thought you deserved a chance for revenge .
i' m the one that helped you find the other guy in your bathroom that night .
the guy that cracked your skull and fucked your wife .
we found him , you killed him .
but you didn' t remember .
so i helped you start looking again , looking for the guy you already killed .
oh , yeah ?
so who was he ?
just some guy .
does it matter who ?
no reason , lenny , no conspiracy , just bad fucking luck .
couple of junkies too strung out to realise your wife didn' t live alone .
but when you killed him i was so convinced that you' d remember .
but it didn' t stick .
like nothing ever sticks , like this won' t stick .
i took that picture .
just when you did it .
look how happy you are .
i wanted to see that face again .
oh , gee , thanks
fuck you .
i gave you a reason to live and you were more than happy to help .
you don' t want the truth .
you make up your own truth , like your police file .
it was complete when i gave it to you .
who took out the twelve pages ?
you , probably .
no , it wasn' t me , see , it was you .
why would i do that ?
to create a puzzle you could never solve .
do you know how many towns ... ... how many john gs or james gs ?
i mean , shit , lenny , i' m a fucking john g.
your name' s teddy .
my mother calls me teddy .
my name' s john edward gammell .
cheer up .
there' s plenty of john gs for us to find .
all you do is moan !
i' m the one that has to live with what you' ve done .
i' m the one that put it all together .
you , you wander around , you' re playing detective .
you' re living a dream , kid .
a dead wife to pine for , a sense of purpose to your life ... ... a romantic quest that you wouldn' t end even if i wasn' t in the picture .
i should kill you .
quit it !
lenny , come on .
you' re not a killer .
that' s why you' re so good at it .
come on , what are you doing ?
you know what time it is ?
it' s beer o' clock , i' m buying .
fuck !
i' m not a killer .
i' m just someone who wanted to make things right .
can i just let myself forget what you' ve told me ?
can i just let myself forget what you made me do ?
you think i just want another puzzle to solve ?
another john g to look for ?
you' re a john g.

lenny !
i have to believe in a world outside my own mind .
i have to believe that my actions still have meaning .
even if i can' t remember them .
i have to believe that when my eyes are closed , the world' s still here .
do i believe the world' s still here ?
is it still out there ?
yeah .
we all need memories to remind ourselves who we are .
i' m no different .
now , where was i ?
# we lay in each other' s arms # but the room is just an empty space # i guess we lived it out # something in the air # we smile too fast # then can' t think of a thing to say # lived with the best times # left with the worst
# i' ve danced with you too long # nothing left to save # there' s something in the air # something in my eye # i' ve danced with you too long # yeah # something in the air # something in my eye
# abracadoo # i lose you # we can' t avoid the clash # the big mistake # now we' re gonna pay and pay # i guess you know # i never wanted anyone more than you # lived all our best times # left with the worst # i' ve danced with you too long # say what you will # but there' s something in the air # something in my eye # i' ve danced with you too long
# there' s something i have to say # there' s something in the air # i' ve danced with you too long #
