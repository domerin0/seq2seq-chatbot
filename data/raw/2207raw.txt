how' s that for a picture ?
a nice shot .
it' s fabulous .
just like a postcard .
is that the view from the hotel ?
we had that aerial up there .
and those smelly old mattresses .
ellen was completely out of it after three cocktails .
she was so smashed there !
she was so pissed there !
he' s making me out to be a drunk .
i don' t find that funny .
they had 32 cocktails !
32 !
could you please take that awful slide off now ?
it' s embarrassing .
if i worked in television i' d use it as the test card .
you' re mean .
that' s how he sharpens his beak .
careful !
stop it , you two .
carry on .
oh , all right .
looks like someone shit in the sea .
that reminds me of my childhood at the lake .
i' m swimming along and see a floating turd .
when i came up i had a pile of shit on my head .
sleep well .
bye .
close the window , it' s cold .
i' il drive .
i' il drive .
no , i' il drive .
you' ve had too much .
i can drive .
katrin !
yes ?
i' il call you to make a date .
fine .
i could pick you up or something .
bye .
wave goodbye .
time for beddy byes .
yes .
she can really get on your nerves .
yes , she' s unbearable at times .
she never stops talking !
i know .
i think she' s unhappy with him .
oh , i don' t know .
that was horrible of you .
what ?
showing the picture .
what picture ?
that awful one of me .
i was embarrassed .
i thought ...
can' t hear you .
i thought it was mean .
that was really rotten of you .
it wasn' t exactly flattering .
and then you leave ...
what' s that in your hair ?
then you leave it on the screen for ages .
you know how i hate that .
stop it now .
it' s embarrassing .
i mean , when we' re alone ...
when we' re alone i don' t mind but not when we have guests over .
there' s no need for that .
some of mine were terrible too .
did you see those ?
what do you want me to say ?
i' ve found another shot .
down the hatch !
i mean a slide .
look at all the ash .
i wish you' d use this properly .
you' ve got to tip the ash inside .
oh shit !
shit , shit , shit !
it' s 5 : 49 on radio 24 , playing hits of the last 24 years .
broadcasting from the 24th floor of the oder tower .
this is magic chris .
coming up , your personal horoscope .
good morning !
12 .
this is chris .
power from the tower .
good morning .
mascha , gregor !
get a move on , it' s late .
hurry up .
get a move on .
we' re running late .
bye , darling .
bye , gregor .
you be good now .
hello .
no , this is ellen speaking .
ellen , really ?
i wanted to remind katrin to buy food because my daughter is coming today .
so she must have left her mobile there last night .
morning .
so , everything ready ?
planning on tooting here all day ?
do you speak german ?
speak any german ?
yes .
you hanging around all day ?
why not ?
because i find it a bit irritating .
i take breaks .
i' il come for something to eat .
well , that' s good .
maybe you could stand down there near the lamppost .
fine , but only because it' s you .
i appreciate it .
i' il treat you to a beer later on .
i mean , i normally love music but ...
radio 24' s magic hour with your horoscope for today .
the stars favour change .
put an abrupt end to all that boredom and try to spice up a dull day .
as you know , life is too short .
and this is to all taureans .
receive unexpected visitors with open arms .
be sure to stock up your fridge .
hi .
come in .
sure ?
yes .
got the phone .
i' ve got to go on .
sure .
hang on .
i' il only be ten seconds .
and that was britney spears .
next up is the happy hour with knut from the tower .
a kiss from chris .
quite a session last night .
indeed .
there you go .
that' s katrin !
i imagined this place to be bigger .
it' s only a computer and a mixer .
it' s big enough .
want to have a go ?
say something .
hello .
announce the time .
33 .
i think i' il leave that to you .
you have a fantastic view .
it' s even better from here .
you can see poland , the stadium .
you okay , knut ?
you look and sound tired .
knut , this is my girlfriend .
no , i mean this is ...
this is ...
my friend' s girlfriend .
she' s my wife' s friend .
whatever .
would you excuse me now ?
i have to go .
so do i.
a nice evening , wasn' t it ?
this thing takes ages .
four .
i serve sausages , chips and schnitzel all day .
soup is always popular .
not surprising at 2 marks 50 .
people like my soup .
business is going well .
how long do you stay open ?
well , it depends .
i' m usually here till 10 .
in the summer till 12 .
sometimes we stay open till 3 .
i mean , if it' s someone' s birthday i' il be stuck here till 3 .
i don' t mind though .
but it makes it difficult to spend time with the family .
you shouldn' t be filming this .
i' m not supposed to smoke in here .
if the health inspector turns up i' m in trouble .
i' il have to pay a 20 mark fine .
20 marks ?
yes .
seriously ?
yes , 20 .
what happened , uwe ?
oh shit , i don' t believe it .
that' s all i need .
i' m sorry .
we were supposed to meet .
there' s not much time .
we' re really busy .
my break doesn' t last forever .
all right !
look at how full this place is .
i' m so thirsty !
eberhard ?
yes ?
got half an hour ?
yes .
can you fill in ?
we' re buying a kitchen .
hello .
we want to look at some kitchens .
fine , go ahead .
could you make a hamburger ?
it' s almost ready .
okay .
my break is almost over .
we have to hurry .
i' d like to know why we' re looking at kitchens anyway .
oh , come on .
you always put a damper on things .
you' ve seen our place .
and our kitchen .
there' s no room for a proper kitchen .
there' s space even in the smallest place .
you always spoil it .
i' ve lost interest .
i see it as a living area .
a social area if you like .
in today' s houses kitchens tend to be bigger .
when i read this crap i' m glad they didn' t take me .
can i take the car tomorrow ?
no .
did you drop something ?
the glass from aunt trude .
shit .
you married a klutz .
do you want some red wine ?
no .
that' il be julia .
so you decided ...
hi .
were you just going to bed ?
come in .
this is jens .
this is my father .
could you take your shoes off ?
hello .
that' s katrin .
jens .
i' ve got something for you .
a letter from mum .
who' s jens ?
my boyfriend .
i bought your cheese .
you didn' t say he was coming .
i said i was coming so i figured ...
ask first .
i didn' t think you' d mind .
are we running a cheap hotel ?
who will she bring along tomorrow ?
so you' re jens ?
yes .
and what do you do ?
that' s my dessert .
the dessert stays here .
i said the dessert stays .
make yourself a sandwich .
well , have a nice evening , jens .
what is it ?
stressing about the dessert .
jens .
we' il be seeing more of jens .
sleep well .
you too .
if you see a speed trap , call us .
0180242424 .
this is radio 24 .
nonstop power from the tower .
want to know what the stars have in store for you ?
stay tuned to find out what this day hol ds .
coming up , the astral shower from the power tower .
with chris , of course .
it' s 8 : 06 .
this is radio 24 .
good morning .
yuck , that is so gross .
what the hell is going on here ?
we' il all go deaf soon at this rate .
holy cow !
are you losing it ?
uwe !
is this an open air concert ?
uwe , please come here .
uwe !
ellen , come here .
uwe , you come here .
ellen , come here , please .
please come here .
uwe , the raw meat in the bathtub .
what did i tell you ?
it' s gross .
notice anything ?
anything different ?
where' s the bird ?
hans peter !
mascha , oh god , mascha !
explain that to the kids .
hans peter !
hans peter !
hans peter !
maybe outside .
he' s not in here .
oh god , no !
leave it open .
he might come back .
uwe !
be quiet .
i think i hear ...
where do we start ?
i heard something here .
hans peter !
well , he' s not here .
do they fly very far ?
why did you leave the door open ?
maybe he' s on one of the balconies .
that was pretty stupid .
i had to air the flat .
so it' s my fault .
it' s always my fault .
it just gets so smoky .
i know , we need an extractor hood !
exactly !
it' s been a problem for weeks .
now you blame me for airing .
well , that' s just great !
why do i bother anyway ?
shit .
i' ve got to go to work too .
i' m sorry .
let' s have a look around the corner .
i don' t have time now !
it' il take five minutes !
i' ve really got to go .
i have to take the meat back .
this is pointless .
where do you want to look ?
birdbrain .
he should be easy to spot .
i mean , he' s bright yellow .
ellen !
hans peter ?
shit !
do you work here ?
oh !
hi .
i' d like to buy something .
for yourself ?
for my better half .
for katrin .
chris ?
yes ?
why did you get me this anyway ?
no special reason .
i think i like it .
really ?
the stuff cost enough !
listen , darling ...
could you hang my t shirt up so it doesn' t get a crease across the chest ?
yes .
when i was a little girl
i thought i' d be a pilot .
i wanted to fly planes .
i wanted to see different countries .
you say , " first finish your studies and there' il be plenty of time later .
then you end up on a truckstop because there isn' t anything else .
and you kind of get stuck there .
it' s all very strange .
but we' re still young so it' s not too late .
maybe chris will get an offer in ...
vienna .
that' s a great city .
vienna is supposed to be nice .
yes .
hi , this is ellen .
could i speak to katrin , please ?
oh , that' s too bad .
that' s too bad .
well ...
well , i still have some overtime .
so i can take time off .
we wanted to go to the pictures .
katrin and i.
oh well .
i can only manage today .
really ?
i mean ...
have you got time ?
really ?
yes .
okay .
bye .
oh dear .
hear the bird ?
hans peter .
what ?
our budgie flew away .
do you feel guilty ?
no , not really .
neither do i.
not in the slightest .
who would have thought ?
me .
i' m serious .
since yesterday .
really ?
you' re joking , right ?
me too .
yes !
hello , uwe !
katrin !
we' re doing fine !
stop it !
have you gone mad ?
he' s gone absolutely mad !
now my dick' s even smaller .
i want to go home !
the last time i was really happy ?
that was when ellen told me that she was having a baby .
i think that was it .
that was really great .
we were both pleased .
it was on holiday .
we had time for each other .
time is pretty important .
it has a big influence on happiness .
you should take time for each other .
but we have to make ends meet .
we all have to make a living somehow .
because money is something you need to live these days .
that was terrific .
oh , here he comes .
evening .
hi .
so , what' s the problem ?
one of the lights is broken .
and now ?
well ...
you drive me home .
we have to take the scooter .
it won' t fit .
so it can go to the garage .
hi , martin .
bye .
bye .
i can put the vespa in the boot .
i' ve had much bigger things in there .
surely you can take me into work .
i told you that i can' t tomorrow .
i have appointments and need the car .
your wife will have no way to get to work tomorrow .
want me to skip work ?
no one' s saying that .
i have a business trip tomorrow .
say i need a lift to my job .
just lift it a little higher .
just a bit higher .
what ?
no .
it won' t work .
fine , we' il try it the other way .
do you have to work in the sticks ?
it' s not funny .
higher , higher .
it' il fit .
another tight fit .
uwe ?
i' m going to bed .
i' il join you soon .
sitting all the time exacerbates female problem areas .
bottom , thighs and waist .
many women suffer from tension .
they taste best .
the cream' s so fresh .
i' il change my image to a fat redhead .
do you think red hair would suit me ?
or darker .
like milva .
beautiful milva .
i bet chris wouldn' t notice anything if i dyed my hair .
sure he would .
no .
come off it .
red hair ?
he hasn' t been very attentive recently .
it' s like that when you' ve been together so long .
it' s just the same with us .
not like it was when we first met .
perhaps we should ...
we should what ?
start again from the beginning .
that' s an idea .
you' re back again .
well , screech owl .
brought a friend along ?
don' t stand there all day .
the stars are having a ball today .
taureans and scorpios particularly should now pay very close attention .
your astral diagram is on the ascendant .
two hundred zlotys .
okay .
can i book for just a few hours ?
yes .
then it' s half price .
chris ?
you' re a sly fox .
yes ?
do you think so ?
it was no coincidence .
what ?
you know .
the horoscopes .
what horoscopes ?
you' ve touched a thousand times .
sparks will fly the 1001 st time .
then we were together in the car .
under the bridge .
you will have a great adventure .
going over the border .
a new perspective .
that was today .
what' s your star sign ?
scorpio .
do you believe all that stuff ?
yes , i do .
well , it' s nice to have something to hold on to .
the whole world , and i' m not joking now .
the whole world has taken on a magical glow in your eyes .
your soul' s current high is set to continue .
the hearts of the world , one especially , lie at your feet .
i' m back .
i got out early today .
there was some sort of accident .
we were sent home .
the truckstop was dead .
do you feel like going out somewhere ?
chrissy ?
chrissy , did you remember to ...
sorry .
are you crazy ?
what' s going on here ?
have you gone mad ?
katrin .
christian .
my clothes .
my clothes !
my shoes .
my shoes !
katrin , i' m sorry .
i should have told you .
keep your hands off me .
don' t stop me .
let me out of here .
let me go .
let me go !
where are you going ?
stay here .
what are you doing ?
hi .
what do you want ?
just thought i' d drop in .
how often have i said to call first ?
i thought you' d be pleased .
you' ve picked a bad time .
that' s not my fault .
oh , no .
are you back already ?
stay where you are .
don' t come into the kitchen .
close your eyes .
go on , close them .
hi .
keep your eyes shut .
keep them shut .
turn around .
keep them shut .
now .
open your eyes .
it even has a light .
i had to move the cupboard .
it was a bit too wide .
but i thought the cupboard could go over there .
what do you think ?
very nice .
i deserve a drop too .
it' s okay , isn' t it ?
well , it' s great to see you so happy .
is something wrong ?
i' ve fallen for someone .
what do you mean , fallen for someone ?
i' m sorry .
you can' t be serious .
who is it ?
that' s irrelevant .
it' s extremely relevant to me .
who is it ?
i want to know who he is .
are you completely off your rocker ?
you come in here and say you' ve fallen for someone .
well .
it' s obvious now .
logical really .
what an idiot .
of course you had to work late !
uwe .
uwe .
i always used to think relationships had to last a lifetime .
now i feel differently .
marriage is no marathon .
no endurance test .
and when you die you' ve crossed the finish line .
perhaps this constellation doesn' t work .
what then ?
perpetual variety ?
it doesn' t have to be perpetual .
it' s different if you have children .
if a whole family is involved .
but i don' t think you have to endure to the bitter end .
you could change partners every eight years .
that' s no bad thing .
if your relationship is in a rut you get bogged down .
you don' t gain much from it .
i used to think differently .
excuse me .
dring .
now ?
at the office ?
i' il be there in ten minutes .
i have to go .
uwe wants a man to man talk .
i' m going out .
uwe .
from the caf .
to loosen our tongues .
i' m glad you' ve come .
have a seat .
do you want to buy a ring ?
18 carat gold .
you can have it for a fiver .
after 13 years of wedlock .
just like that .
i' ve fallen for someone .
man , i' m 40 now .
i can' t start again at my age .
i' m 37 myself .
well .
it can happen to anyone .
she must be out of her mind .
crazy .
don' t be so hard on ellen .
well , you' re a great moral support , aren' t you .
thanks a bunch .
you expect me to boost your esteem ?
i thought you' d hit me .
it' s not all ellen' s fault .
of course not , but ...
well then .
katrin is furious with ellen .
what' s katrin got to do with it ?
she knows too .
she walked right in on us .
she caught us in the act .
i hadn' t told her anything .
what a predicament .
ridiculous really .
damn it .
today really tops everything .
what an awful day .
no .
you' re pulling my leg , aren' t you ?
just give us a call .
our number is 0180242424 .
it' s 5 : 30 .
here' s radio 24 .
megahits from the last 24 years .
from the 24th floor of the oder tower .
nonstop power from the power tower .
of course ...
shut your face !
central station .
geminis , your day won' t be a bowl of cherries .
you are at odds with yourself .
feel misunderstood .
pick fights with your best friends .
anger and frustration are in the air .
your self confidence is at rock bottom .
your best option is to sleep in .
stay well away from alcohol .
16 .
16 minutes past 7 .
this is radio 24 with the magic hour .
good morning .
hi .
hello .
what are you doing here ?
mum' s working late .
she sent us .
she said she' d be home late from work .
she told us to come to you after school .
that' s right .
i have my hands full .
she' s crazy .
i don' t believe this .
i have to organize my catering .
stupid cow .
sorry .
give us a kiss .
sit there .
i' il be over right away .
do you want some lunch ?
egg and chips .
curry sausage .
shit !
sunshine , leave the kids alone .
i' m not doing anything .
just looking .
i' m not causing trouble .
you' ve already caused enough trouble .
no , you have to ...
i was just ...
stupid idiot !
i told you to stay away from the kids .
clumsy oaf !
get out of here !
get lost !
bastard .
no .
what a shame .
pick that up .
shake it off .
it happens .
it happens .
come on .
well .
look at it !
buy him a new book .
shit .
look at it .
he can redo it .
would you let your son hand that in ?
do it again with him tonight .
i can' t ...
who' s making trouble ?
bumble .
you could grab a towel .
get me a towel !
bumble .
just stay cool .
strong and silent .
why should i be ?
everyone butting in .
i made a mistake .
so what ?
strong and silent .
why are you poking me ?
you always make mistakes .
it' s getting on my nerves .
well .
this is all a bit strange , isn' t it .
but still .
i felt it was high time we talked about this .
things can' t stay as they are .
it' s been going on a long time .
quite a while now .
gregor .
go and tell him , please .
please .
we had an agreement .
well , as i said .
we' re all sensible adults here .
enough is enough .
the situation we find ourselves in at the moment can' t continue .
we have two children .
we have a family .
we must sort this out somehow .
i don' t know .
i' d like to hear your opinion .
yours , chris .
and yours , of course , ellen .
how do you want to proceed ?
how do you plan to resolve this ?
it' s been going on a good while .
uwe , i don' t really know what you' re expecting to hear .
an answer .
i' m not promising anything .
i can' t do that .
you' re acting as if we were on trial .
but this isn' t something we planned secretly over a long time .
it could as easily have been you .
hang on , chris .
i can understand if you slip up and go too far .
jump into bed together .
okay .
i can cope with that .
but if it happens regularly as it does at the minute
i can' t stand for it .
certainly not from supposed friends .
what' s the matter ?
look , it' s turned out really well .
that' s cute .
mascha' s a real artist .
lovely .
who is it ?
no one in particular .
a lady .
but mum and dad have to discuss something important right now .
we' il have time later .
why don' t you draw ...
katrin ?
okay .
thanks a lot .
i won' t stand for it .
i feel like i' m in kindergarten .
kindergarten ?
who started this game , anyway ?
it certainly wasn' t me .
sure you don' t want any cake ?
no , thanks .
i' m not hungry .
here' s the ashtray .
well , i think ...
okay .
listen , uwe .
i say you stop seeing each other .
that would be my suggestion .
i can' t promise that .
i' m not interested in talking .
it won' t achieve anything .
i can see that , pal .
i may as well go .
go then .
don' t slam the door .
i can do as i like in my own home .
yes , of course .
if i want to slam the door , i will .
does anyone want more coffee ?
no , thanks .
only a man could react like that .
a totally male reaction .
really , you have to ask yourself this .
what is a valid argument and what role does dented pride play ?
yes .
a 90 % role , i' d say .
yes .
ever ask if i was happy ?
give me compliments ?
of course .
you criticized me from dawn to dusk .
now it' s too late .
something' s happened .
all at once you start playing the injured party .
i' m glad i don' t have children .
bye .
i think ...
well , i' m suddenly ...
i see him in a new light .
i ...
now i find him very attractive again .
it sounds crazy .
but i can understand ellen .
i can imagine what attracts her .
and what she' s discovered in him .
bye , gregor .
bye , mascha .
bye , love .
hello .
bye .
our paths were bound to cross at some point .
i' m sorry .
where are you going ?
away somewhere .
please stay .
just for a moment .
i want to know why .
i want to know what i' ve done .
you can tell me that at least .
just say what i' ve done wrong .
i wish i could .
if it' s my bad teeth , i' il go to the dentist .
if you want a new kitchen , i' il buy you one .
what the neighbours think is more important , is it ?
you' ve done nothing wrong .
i don' t understand you .
what' s the problem ?
what does he have that i don' t ?
uwe , i ...
don' t touch me .
please .
please .
please .
you made a vow to me .
a pledge .
you solemnly declared , " till death us do part " .
quiet .
don' t get sentimental .
let me go .
stop it .
no .
please .
don' t leave me .
i won' t let you go .
you won' t get me back like this .
this is simply ridiculous .
if you leave now , don' t bother coming back , stupid cow .
i understand what he says , i know .
but what can i do ?
i can' t change how i feel .
i can' t help it .
you can' t do anything .
the feeling is there .
i can' t resist it .
i really did try .
at first i was so careful .
i didn' t know where it would lead .
it kept going further , and ...
it' s no longer just a flirt .
it' s an opportunity for me .
dring .
hello .
here' s the information , all the figures and a floor plan .
this is the kitchen .
big and spacious .
plenty of room for a table and chairs .
when did you want to move in ?
as soon as possible .
let' s look at the other apartment .
it' s not ideal in my opinion .
living room .
that' s stipulated ?
you could use the other room as a living room if you so decide .
lovely corner bathtub .
great .
hang on .
is there a bath for grown ups ?
stick your legs out .
this apartment' s cosy .
all neat and compact .
it' s a bit small .
just three rooms .
but the rent for this is lower than for the other .
you could make kitchen cabinets .
if you go to all that trouble you have to stay here permanently .
we don' t quite agree on this yet .
we' il think about it .
don' t make a snap decision .
sleep on it .
why all the fuss ?
what' s up ?
you' re too eager .
it' s fine .
don' t spoil things .
too tiny for four .
spare us your comments .
we' il improvise .
she wants a sale .
we must find something .
we' il come back later .
well .
we' il think about it .
you' re exaggerating .
it' s fine .
we' d burst at the seams .
what' s all this about ?
what are you playing at ?
i' m speaking to you .
there' s your stuff .
i don' t want you in my room any more .
where can i go ?
get set up in the spare room .
katrin , it' s still our flat .
there' s more .
here' s the perfume .
i hope you had fun at my expense .
we didn' t make fun of you at all .
help me with this , please .
i won' t give you a hand .
i' il move your stuff , then .
stop this .
we' re still married .
we' re no longer married .
we' re still married .
stop flitting back and forth to her .
our marriage isn' t ruined yet .
we haven' t divorced .
isn' t ruined ?
who destroyed everything we had ?
i just need a bit of time , damn it .
all i need is a little time .
time .
is that so ?
my fling with ellen may blow over .
i need time too .

you can' t promise ?
you made me different promises a few years ago .
what' s the plan , anyway ?
are you going to keep coming back home ?
just leave and move in with her .
i need time .
go to her .
don' t run back and forth .
i can' t leave .
i need time .
don' t you see ?
wimp .
i need time .
yes , i' m a wimp .
you come home and pretend nothing' s wrong .
and then you go back to her .
i have to adapt to the situation too .
calm down .
it' s okay .
kiss me !
i have to pick up the goulash at 12 .
it' s high time he came .
here he is .
at last .
sorry i' m late .
no doubt you' ve all heard the news .
there' s been a serious accident on the autobahn .
it' s a miracle that i' m standing before you .
i really owe my life to your local radio station .
to be precise , the horoscope feature with magic ...
magic piss .
in the horoscope for today he strongly recommended stopping to have a break .
i regard this as a sign from heaven .
i perceive it as confirmation of the success of our common project .
the stars are smiling on it .
we believe in frankfurt oder as an industrial centre .
time for the official ceremony .
mayor hartwig .
mr. kurzer .
would you mind doing the honours ?

and wipe that smile off your face .
we have to go , don' t we ?

i had to get out .
i couldn' t just sit around .
why should i wait until his lordship deigns to come ?
let' s have some music .
that' s good .
leave it on .
i like that .
for a change .
did he say he wanted to come home ?
no , we weren' t that clear .
last night i was hopeful .
i thought things were looking up .
but probably ...
i' m sick of them making a fool of me .
i' ve had enough .
but i have to say , it was quite an absurd situation .
i open the bathroom door and what do i see ?
the two of them in the bath !
and i say sorry and go back out again .
honest .
i' ve been listening to that music for two weeks .
uwe , come on .

ms. schrder would be impressed .
i can do it .

katrin .
katrin , i' m sorry .
i have to talk to you .
i' ve made a mess of everything .

katrin said that ?
yes .

very funny .
now they' ve invaded our bedroom .
a black hole of a day for you too .
a nasty lunar eclipse mars the night .
venus is in reverse .
no cuddles today .
the day is pitch black .
everything is futile .
the sun and pluto are at loggerheads .
all in all a day to forget .
expect no improvement .
later your energy cycle will slump to nothing .
