what do you think ?
will advanced chem get you off my back ?
not completely , but it' il help .
done .
you know , mothers have killed to get their daughters on squads .

when i lived in kentucky did they still do the loser sneeze in kentucky ?
no .
they had , uh , guns and homemade bombs .
what about l. a. ?
there wasattitude in l. a. , but no losersneeze .
i' m pretty sure the loser sneeze is officially dead .

nice recruit , torrance .
a real captain would' ve seen what i saw : a big dykey loser .
i' d say that' s strike two .
what is up ?
i went out on a limb foryou , and you bail ?
i' m not about stealing .
what are you talking about ?
you ripped off those cheers .
listen , missy , our cheers are 100 % original .
count the trophies .
well , your trophies are bullshit , because you' re a sad ass liar .

she' s right .

then they could feel good about sending raggedy ann here tojack us for our cheers .
raggedy ann ?
ugly redhead with a video camera attached to her hand .
y' all been coming up here foryears , trying to steal our routines .
and wejust love seeing them on espn .
what are you talking about ?
brr , it' s cold in here .
i said there must be some toros in the atmosphere " ?
you don' t think a white girl made that shit up .
i i
our free cheer service is over as ofthis moment .
over !
finito !
everytime we getsome , herey' all come , tryin ' to steal it , puttin ' blond hair on it and calling it something different .
we' ve had the best squad around foryears , but no one' s been able to see what we can do .
but you better believe all that' s gonna change this year .
i' m captain , and i guarantee you we' il make it to nationals .
handoverthe tape you made tonight and we' il callit even fornow .
we don' t have any tape .
really .

jenelope , let' sgo .
wejust so almost got our asses kicked back there !
i mean , i knew i' d seen those routines before .
we usedtoplay east compton all the time .
you really had no idea , did you ?
do you know what this means ?
my entire cheerleading career has been a lie .
well , look on the bright side .
it' s only cheerleading .
i am only cheerleading .
do you believe in curses ?
what are you talking about ?
i think i' m cursed .
and why is that ?
this past summer at cheer camp , all the new seniors had to do a dare .
see , there' s this thing calledthespirit stick , andit can never , evertouch theground .
torrance shipman , your mission , should you choose to accept it and you better is to capture the spirit stick ... anddrop it in front ofthe entire camp .
doyou wannago my way
doyou wannago my way
the future is clear let' sget intogear
y' all are such an inspiration to us .
well , i just wanted to congratulate you guys and take a picture ofyou ...
with the spirit stick .
here .
doyou wannago my way
doyou wannago my way here .
i don' t want it now .
no , it' s okay .
the spirit stick doesn' t lose anything .
the person who drops it , however , [ deep voice ]
goes to hades !
i don' t mean to laugh , but cheerleading urban legends ?
you' re notjinxed .
shit happens .
i have to tell you something .
i' m on the phone , creep .
i realize that , and normally i' d be listening on the other line , but this is important .
okay , what ?
ohh !
get out !
thankyou for listening .
yo .
back later .
is aaron around ?
do you know when ?
no .
have him call torrance .
it' s urgent .
all right .
big red totally screwed us !
i mean monster screwed us !
i put this to the entire squad .
swearyou guys didn' t know .
big red didn' t exactly let any of us help with the routines , torrance .
i cannot believe she did this .
i feel awful .
it' s depraved .
i mean , those east compton girls wanted to grill our asses .
big redran theshow , man .
we werejust flying ignorami , forsobbing out loud .
we can' t go to regionals with a stolen routine .
it' s too risky .
changing the routine now ... would be total murder suicide .
seriously .
let' s not put the " duh " in " dumb .
how are east compton gonna prove anything ?
you people are unbelievable .
i mean , we' re talking about cheating here .
sorry , new girl , but nobody hit your buzzer .
look , lhate to bepredictable , but ldon' t give a shit .
we learned that routine fair and square .
we logged the man hours .
don' t punish the squad for big red' s mistake .
this isn' t about cheating .
this is about winning .
everyone in favor ofwinning ?
iget whatyou' re saying , missy , but there' s no time .
ifwe don' t do the routine , we' ve got nothing else .
so , you in ?
whatever .
get out of here !
hey , this is the living room .
it' s public domain .
yo .
hey , may i please speak to aaron ?
it' s torrance .
he' s not here .
he' s , uh he' s not here .
bye .
ohh !
i' il take " famous losers " for 200 , alex .
shut up , moron !
it' s not my fault you' re in love with a big gay cheerleader who won' t return your phone calls .

miss red snaked our routines from the east compton clovers .
all ofour routines .
what ?
they found out .
they showed up at the game .
gauntlets were thrown .
tell me you didn' t know about this .
i don' t know what to do here .
ofcourse i didn' t know , but you gotta calm down .
this is not that big a deal .
everybody uses everybody else' s material .
it' s like this unwritten rule or something .
that doesn ' t help me .
we can' t do theirroutine at regionals because they' re gonna do theirroutine .
come on , tor , you need a new routine .
that' s all .
no problem .
just hire a professional choreographer .

not enough makeup .
what' s with the skin ?
sunlight " !
male cheerleaders .
enough said .
smile .
don' t smile .
chicken .
good general tone and musculature .
report those compliments to your ass before it gets so big ... it forms its own web site .
and you , i take you to be the captain , which means you' il probably need more work than anyone .
look , you don' t but shh !
no , no , no .
don' t speak .
don' t think .
listen and learn .
i' m a choreographer .
that' s what i do .
you ... are cheerleaders .
cheerleaders are dancers who have gone retarded .
whatyou do is a tiny , pathetic subset ofdancing .
i will attempt to transform your robotic routines into poetry ... written with the human body .
follow me or perish , sweater monkeys .
i wantyou to think ofwhatyou ate today .
got it ?
now cut that in half .
this is called a diet .
everyone start one today .
darcy , honey , you should stop eating .
you see , when you skip a meal , your body feeds off its fat stores .
and ifyou skip enough , maybe your body will eat your ass .
why does everyone have togo on a diet ?
because in cheerleading , we throw people in the air , and fat people don' t go as high .
come on , come on .
let' sget back to work !
ah !
i want dangerous !
i wanna feellikesomebody' s gonna snap theirneck !
spirit fingers !
give mespirit fingers !
spirit fi ngers .
give me spirit !
ouch !
what ?
i told you i' d catch you .
look , i understand you have underwear up your ass right now , but it beats the hell out ofa shattered skull .
think about it .
okay , now , spirit fi ngers .
spirit fi ngers !
andspirit fingers !
oh , my god !
these are not spirit fi ngers .
these are spirit fi ngers .
and these ... are gold .
one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight .
one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight .
screw this .
i did not sign on for spirit fi ngers .
come on !
the spirit fi ngers are great !
yeah , whatever .
we are so screwed .
hey .
what' s the matter ?
hey .
you don' t wanna know .
ah .
cheer crisis .
i' vejust gotten so bogged down in all this ... crap .
well , if it' s crap , why do you do it ?
i don' t know .
so quit .
maybe i should .
yeah , i mean , ifyou don' t like it anymore .
i didn' t say that .
sounds like it .
i don' t know what i want .
irememberback when lcheeredat myschoolin detroit .
you cheered at your other high school ?
no , i never cheered , but i know what you' re going through .
and regardless ofall the politics and the doubts ... and the crap , you just have to know that you can do it .
and if it helps ,
i know you can .
you do ?
yeah .
allright , allright !
i' m ready to make a foolofmyself .

hi .
you , yes .
your head was down .
your head was down during that move .
how are you gonna give a proper score ... ifyour head is down during a move ?
remember , they give extra points for alacrity and effulgence .
did we bring those ?
oh , no .
look who' s here .
hi .
we' re in trouble .
andnow , making theirfirst appearance at the u. c. a. california regionals , the east compton clovers !
yeah , clovers !
i' m standing here with five time national returning champions , the rancho carne toros .
leading the squad this year is senior torrance shipman .
torrance , one ofthe things we' ve come to expect ... from the toros over the last fewyears is a highly originalroutine .
can we expect thesame thisyear ?
well ,
i think everyone goes out there the same way , being as prepared as they can be and just hoping for the best .
we' rejust glad to be back here ... and eager to see what other squads have come up with .
prepare fortotaldomination !

prepare fortotaldomination !
domination !
domination !

didn' t wejust see this routine ?
y' allready forthis
what the f
ahem .
the rancho carne toros , ladies andgentlemen .
go , toros !
did they screw up .
that was , um , interesting .
nicejob !
y' all should' vejust stuck with our routines .
yeah .
don' t worry .
we' il send you a postcard from nationals .
six , seven , eight .
next up , the fighting beavers ofsan bernardino .
torranceshipman ?
yes .
tad freeman , universal cheer association .
we have a problem .
a problem ?
oh , yes , a verybigproblem .
hey .
idon' t know ifyou can imagine ...
hey . the incredible sense ofdeja vu lexperiencedasl was watching that last routine .
it tends to make me suspicious i wouldn' tjust now .
what ?
official cheer business .
come on .
it' s me .
hey , torrance !
you see , i [ mouthing words ]
that was smooth .
real smooth .
i' il see her later .
all righty .
oh , uh , by the way , nice spirit fi ngers .
yeah .
well , here' s another .
thanks .
obviously your toros aren' t the only squad with this particular routine .
does the name sparky polastri mean anything to you ?
sparky polastri ?
mm hmm .
apparently he' s been peddling this same routine up and down the california coast .
six squads total .
we' re holding an emergency session ofthe discretionary panel .
about what ?
we' ve never had a situation like this before .
we really should disqualify you and no , don' t punish the squad .
it was my choice to hire sparky , not theirs .
don' t penalize everyone for my bad judgment .
but since there' s no precedent for this , there' s nothing in the rule books that forbids it .
it' s simply frowned upon , and i suppose we can' t disqualify you on those grounds alone .
as defending champions , you are guaranteed a bid to florida , but know that we' il be watching you .
and don' t expect to show up at fi nals with that routine .
taking the floornow
what areyou doing ?
you' re wrecking everything lbuilt !
it' s not totally herfault .
ihookedup
this season should have been gravy , okay ?
i handpicked the squad , i delivered an idiot proof routine .
platter , nationals , hello !
don' t you mean a stolen routine ?
oh .
don' t be so naive , torrance .
look , the truth is i was a real leader , okay ?
i did what i had to do to win at nationals , and ever since i handed the reins over to you , you' ve run my squad into the ground !
if i made any mistake as a squad leader , it wasn' t borrowing cheers .
it was announcing you as my successor .
uh uh .
not cool .
hey , tor .
tor .
wait , wait , wait , wait , wait .
let me go .
i just wanna get out of here .
hey , big red' s a bitch .
we all know that .
even she knows that .
i don' t know what to do here , aaron .
look .
i know i haven' t always been there foryou since i went to college .
it' s been a rough transition , for both of us .
but i still care about you as much as i ever did .
you know that , right ?
you do ?
ofcourse .
which is why i hate to see you like this , all stressed out .
it' s not good foryou .
you' re a great cheerleader , tor , and you' re cute as hell .
it' sjust that maybe [ sighs ]
maybe ... you' rejust not captain material , and there' s nothing wrong with that .
maybe you should consider letting courtney and whitney take over the squad .
they' rejust like big red .
you want me to give up captain ?
hey , let them deal with the politics .
you just do what you do best , tor .
you cheer .
cheer , tor .
okay ?
i just wanna see you happy .
bye .
mm .
mmm .
sleep tight , sweetie .
friend ofyours ?
he' s my boyfriend .
look , cliff , i can explain .
no .
it' s cool .
here , um , i made you a tape too .
cliff
hey , torrance , uh , it' s me , cliff .
um , here' s , uh
i wrotesomething , uh , foryou , so here it is .
oh , torrance

' causeyou' rejust what lneed
andyou' rejust what lneed
not everything works asit seems
is thatso hard to believe
yeah
aaron called us last night .
he told us you' re turning the squad over to us .
just because you bit the big one as captain , does not mean we' re gonna be super hard on you .
oh .
we' il treat you as ifyou ... didn' t screw us into the ground .
gee , thanks .
everyone .
torrance is not to be harmed .
we' ve already decided on a course ofaction .
we' re gonna forego nationals this year .
everyone' s already agreedto it .
uh , except me .
and me !
both ofyou can be replaced .
lcan' t believeyouguys .
the onlyperson who can officially resign thepost ofcaptain is the captain , and i' m not going anywhere .
then we' il have to overthrow you .
which we will !
enough !
our whole cheering career , we' ve stakedourreputation on being the best , the most inventive .
now we fi nally have a chance to truly be original , and you' re all running scared .
she' s crazy .
iam not crazy , and i' m not resigning as captain either .
you' re gonna have to kill me fi rst .
that can be arranged .
shut it , whitney !
let her talk !
look , lknowl' ve screwedup royally as captain , but lbelieve in this squad , andlknow we can bounce backfrom this .
i' m not saying it' s gonna be easy .
it' s gonna be hard work .
we need a new routine , something amazing and fresh , and we' ve got less than three weeks till nationals , but ifwe can do it , ifwe can pull this off , then we can really call ourselves original .
now who' s with me ?
all right !
yeah .
yeah !
yeah !
how ' bout it , girls ?
it' s gonna be hard without you two .
fine .
sure .
whatever .
okay .
let' s do this .
we' re gonna devote every waking hourtopractice before school , in between classes andafterschool .
afternoonpractices willhave to be twice aslong .
we' ve gotta do whateverit takes to be in perfectphysicalshape .
yeah .
you can go a little harder .
yeah , that feelsgood .
maybe we should join the squad .
push .
oh , yeah .
fag !
andsince the football team sucks no matterhowhard we cheer , we' il use nightgames topractice too .
but that' s not all .
we' re gonna study othertypes ofmovement , from swing dance ... to interpretive dance , ... you grow and you grow and you bloom ! even mime .
we' ildrawinspiration from martialarts , hah ! musicals , everything .
youguys know we' ve got the talent .
we' vejustgotta work ourasses offandtrust ourinstincts all ofourinstincts .
tor !
wha wow !
what are you doing here ?
just wanted to come by and see you .
is this a bad time ?
yeah .
yeah , yeah , yeah .
i' m super busy .
i' m workin ' on this project
yeah , you sound super busy .
i guess that' s it .
you were too busy to believe in me .
oh .
no , no , but wait .
you weren' t too busy to sell me out to courtney and whitney , were you ?
gee , now i' m confused .
well , i hope you' re not too busy to hear this .
kiss my ass , aaron !
it' s over !
you' re a great cheerleader , aaron .
it' sjust that ... maybe you' re not exactly boyfriend material .
bye bye .
you' re a cheerleader ?
u. c. a. just posted the nationals list on the lnternet .
east compton isn' t on it .
they couldn ' t raise the money in time .
they' re not going .
what do you mean , " they' re not going " ?
torrance , that' sgoodnews .
they cannot not go .
that' s not good news .
what are you talking about ?
they don' t go , we win .
once again we' re the best .
i defi ne best as competing against the best there is out there and beating them .
they have to go .
it' s so unfair .
the fi rst inner city squad to get a bid , and they can' t afford to go ?
look , mom .
her head is spinning off into another dimension .
justin !
the company gets hit up for money all the time , honey .
i just can' t .
it' s not that much money , mr. level playing field .
tell them the deal .
maybe they' il wanna help .
yeah ?
okay , i' il make the call , but they' il probably say no .
don' t let them .
think of how much it' il mean to east compton .
they deserve to go .
do the right thing , dad !
did that just happen ?
yeah .
where we come from , ' cheer ' is not a word we hear very often .
they should call us ' inspiration leaders ' instead .
oh , that' s deep .
i like that .
i don' t know why we writin ' to some talk show host .
it' s like we beggin ' for charity .
it' s not charity .
pauletta patton' s from our neighborhood .
she' il understand why we need the money .
tell her we need to buy donuts .
her big butt will understand that .
ha ha !
stop being counterproductive , all right ?
lava , please ... stop teaching her these big words before she choke on one .
no , better i choke you , lafred .
look, jenelope  you guys , stop !
please .
damn !
well , tell her about the late night practices we been having .
there you go .
that' s the kind ofstuff she wants to hear about .
now we' re talkin ' .
you guys have to go to nationals .
did you come up here just to tell me that ?
here .
i got my dad' s company to sponsoryou guys .
what is this , hush money ?
no .
oh , right .
it' sguilt money .
you pay our way in and you sleep better at night ... knowing how your whole world is based on one big , old fat lie .
well , you know what ?
we don' t need you .
why do you have to be so mean ?
i' m just trying to do the right thing here .
i' m trying to be strong for my squad , okay ?
that' s what a captain does .
well , i' m a captain too , you know , and i' m trying to make it right .
you wanna make it right ?
then when you go to nationals , bring it .
don' t slack off because you feel sorry for us .
that way , when we beat you , we' il know it' s because we' re better .
i' il bring it .
don' t worry .
i never do .
yeah , your parents just have to sign it .
i didn' t do anything !
bye .
bye , tor .
i listened to your tape .
i loved it .
great .
can i talk to you ?
i was upset that night .
aaron gave me a ride home .
it wasjust a good night kiss .
it meant nothing .
oh .
i' m sorry .
and i wanted you to know that ...
i broke up with him .
congratulations .
he didn' t believe in me .
you did !
whatever .
that' s important to me !
you believed in me !

that' s right , i am a cheerleader , and you' re a dumb ass .
torrance likes you .
okay ?
she likes you .
she has an odd way ofshowing it .
don' t be stupid .
she broke up with her boyfriend foryou .
yeah .
look .
do us all a favor and get overyourself and tell her how you feel .
i thought i had .

today' s lettercomes from east compton , california .
where we come from ...
cheer is not a word that you hear very often ,
but that' s what we are , the cheerleaders of east compton high school .
they should really call us inspiration leaders , because that' s what we do .
we inspire the people from our neighborhoods ...
to believe that our team can win .
that' s why we' re askingyou to fulfill our wish ... to send us to the national cheerleading competition for the fi rst time .
well , clovers , you got your wish .
