i don' t think so .
not really my cup of tea .
all right .
l had to come all the way from the highways and byways ... ... of tallahassee , florida ... ... to motor city , detroit to find my true love .
lf you gave me a million years to ponder ... ... l would never have guessed that true romance and detroit would go together .
and to this day , the events that followed all seem like a distant dream .
but the dream was real ... ... and was to change our lives forever .
l kept asking clarence why our world seemed to be collapsing ... ... and everything was so shitty .
" that' s the way it goes .
but don' t forget ... " ... it goes the other way too .
that' s the way romance is .
usually that' s the way it goes .
but every once in a while , it goes the other way too .
my heart beats and there is time .
don' t move , tojo .
you' il be unconscious soon ... lt' s an ancient technique .
oxygen .
come .
oh , look what happened !

and later on in the story , he gets in this fight with this nazi bastard .
and the kraut grabs hold of the chain .
well , the ring goes overboard .
nick , he dives into the ocean to get it .
isn' t that cool ?
what is it ?
you' re crying ?
what did i do ?
did i do something ?
you didn' t do nothing .

i didn' t just happen to be at that theater .
i was paid to be there .
if you were paid to be there , what are you ?

he called the place where i work .
he ordered a girl .
he wanted you to get laid .
said you didn' t get out much , and it was your birthday and all .
he wanted me to act like i just showed up .
how did he know you were going to be at that theater ?
i go to the movies every year on my birthday .
he called me this week to find out what my birthday movie was going to be .
you' re not mad ?
no , man .
i can' t tell you ...
that was one of the best times i ever had .
it was .
you know , i knew something must be rotten in denmark .
there' s no way you could like me that much .
i was so relieved when you took off your dress ... ... and didn' t have a dick .
stop being so fucking calm about all this !
look in your house .
there' s a note on your tv .
it only says " dear clarence , " because i couldn' t write anymore .
so i just said , " alabama , come clean .
just tell him what' s what .
if he tells you ...
... to go back to drexl and fuck yourself ...
... then go back to drexl and fuck yourself .
drexl ?
what' s a drexl ?
please shut up !
i' m trying to come clean .
i' ve been a call girl for exactly four days and you are my third customer .
i want you to know , that i am not damaged goods .
i' m not what they call in florida , white trash !
i' m a really good person .
and when it comes to relationships ... ... l am one hundred percent .
i am one hundred percent monogamous .
you stay with one guy ?
exactly .
if i' m with you , then i' m with you .
and i don' t want anybody else .
now , i got to tell you something else .
when you said last night was one of the best times you' ve had ... ... did you mean physically ?
yeah , yeah .
but i' m talking about the whole night .
i never had as much fun with a girl , as i had with you , my whole life .
it' s true .
you like elvis .
you like janis ... ... you like kung fu movies .
you like the partridge family ...
actually , i don' t like the partridge family .
that was part of the act .
and i feel really goofy saying this ... ... after only knowing you one night , and me being a call girl and all ...
but , i think i love you .
wait a second .
look , i' ve been trying to keep this whole thing in perspective .
you just said you loved me .
if i say i love you , throw caution to the wind ... ... let the chips fall as they may , and you' re lying , i' il fucking die .
i' m not lying to you .
and i swear from this moment forth ... ... l will never lie to you again .
well , hello , mrs. worley .
how do you do , mr. worley .
top of the morning to you , mrs. worley .
bottom of the ninth , mr. worley .

my beautiful , charming , sexy wife ... ... mrs. alabama worley ?
are there any others , mr. worley ?
no , not for me , no .

yes , yes .
excuse me .
do you think you could turn down the heat just a teeny bit ?
i must ask you a question .
who and what is a drexl ?
quiet .
huh ?
he was my pimp .
you had a pimp ?
i was a call girl .
call girls have pimps .
was he black ?
he thinks he is .
he said his mama was an apache but i suspect he' s lying .
is he nice ?
i wouldn' t go so far as to say that .
he treated me pretty decent .
i was only there for four days .
he got a little bit rough the other day .
what do you mean ?
with you ?
no , with my friend llene .
what did he do to llene ?
slapped her around .
kicked her in the stomach .
it was scary .
this motherfucker sounds beautiful .
what did you do to end up with a son of a bitch like that ?
what are you talking about ?
floyd say he don' t be eating pussy .
drexl , any nigger says he don' t eat pussy' s lying his ass off .
i heard that .
hold on a second .
big d. , you saying you eat pussy ?
yeah , motherfucker , i eat the pussy , i eat the bud .
i eat every fucking thing .
if i ever did eat any pussy , i would never eat any pussy , right ?
but if i did eat some pussy ... ... l sure as hell wouldn' t tell no goddamn body .
i' d be ashamed as a motherfucker .
shit , nigger , you smoke enough sherm ... ... your dumb ass would do a lot of motherfucking things .
you' d be up in there suckin ' niggers ' dicks !
fuck you guys , man .
you guys are fucked up , all right ?
hey .
wait a second .
we' s just fucking with you .
in fact , i' m going to show you what i mean with a little demonstration .
toss me the burner .
all right , dig this .
pretend it' s that fine centerfold bitch .
you know what i' m saying ?
and you are you .
honey , where you going ?
bathroom .
well , can you live with it ?

i said can you live with it ?

that son of a bitch walking around breathing the same air as you .
getting away with it every day .
are you haunted ?
yeah .
you want to get un haunted ?
oh , yeah .
well , i' d kill him .
shoot him in the face .
put him down like a dog .
i can' t believe what you' re saying .
i' m not saying nothing .
i' s just saying what i' d do .
you' d do that ?
the fuck don' t deserve to live .
look , he' s haunting me , you know .
i want to kill him , but i don' t want to spend the rest of my life in jail .
hey man , i don' t blame you .
if i thought i' d get away with it ...
get away with it ?
killing is the hard part .
getting away with it , that' s easy .
you think a cop gives a fuck about a pimp ?
listen .
every pimp in the world could get shot .
two in the back of the fucking head .
cops would throw a party , man .
as long as you' re not at the scene of the crime ... ... with a smoking gun in your hand , you' il get away with it .
clarence , i like you .
always have , always will .
' bama .
where you going ?
i need you to write down your former address .
why ?
so i can go over there and pick up your stuff , that' s why .
oh , baby , come on , clarence .
i just want to disappear from there .
i know this scares the shit out of you , but i' m not scared of that motherfucker .
you are completely out of his reach .
he poses absolutely no threat to you .
if he doesn' t matter , and he doesn' t ... ... then it seems silly you lose all your things now .
listen .
you don' t know him .
no , you don' t know me .
not when it comes to shit like this .
i need to do this .
i want you to know that you can count on me to protect you .
come on , please just write it down .
this isn' t a good idea .
i' m telling you , it' il be fine .
i' il be in and out of there .
be careful .
i will .
i love you .
i love you , too .
you want something ?
yeah , you drexl ?
no man , i' m marty .
well , i want to talk to drexl .
well , what the fuck you want to talk to him about ?
it' s about alabama .
he was asking about alabama .
where the fuck is that bitch ?
she' s with me .
who the fuck are you ?
i' m her husband .
well , that makes us practically related .
have a seat , boy .
have an egg roll .
we got everything here ... ... from " little eye joel " to " damned if i know .
no , thanks .
no , thanks ?
what that mean ?
i think you' re too scared to be eating .
now , see ...
we' re sitting down here , ready to negotiate .
and you' ve already given up your shit .
i' m still a mystery to you .
but i know exactly where your white ass is coming from .
if i ask you if you want some dinner and you grab an egg roll ... ... l say , he' s acting like he ain' t got a care in the world .
and who knows ?
maybe he don' t .
maybe this fool is such a bad motherfucker ... ... he don' t have to worry about nothing .
he just sits down ... ... and watches my motherfucking tv .
see ?
you haven' t even sat down yet .
that tv over there , since you' ve been here ... ... has a woman with her breast just hanging out .
well , you haven' t even bothered to look .
you just been clocking me .
now , i know i' m pretty .
but i' m not as pretty as a couple of titties .
this child be fierce .
i' m not eating because i' m not hungry .
i' m not sitting because i' m not staying .
i' m not looking at the movie because i' ve already seen it seven years ago .
it is the mack .
max julian , carol speed and richard pryor .
i' m not scared of you .
i just don' t like you .
that' s payoff money .
alabama is moving on to greener pastures .
we' re not negotiating , i don' t like to barter .
what' s in there is for my peace of mind .
my peace of mind is worth that much .
not one penny more .
it' s empty .
marty , you know what we got here ?
a motherfucking charlie bronson .
mr. majestyk ?
look here , charlie .
none of this bullshit is necessary .
i don' t got no hold over alabama .
i was just trying to lend a girl a helping hand .
that' s what you get .
you fuck with me , white boy !
look at this !
you fond of my motherfucking freaks ?
shit !
you motherfucker !
your ass got to be crazy !
you must have thought it was white boy day .
it ain' t white boy day , is it ?
no man , it ain' t white boy day .
shit man , you done fucked up again .
well , well , well .
look what we got here .
clarence worley ?
it sounds almost like a nigger name .
and i know where you live .
4900 , 160th street ... ... apartment 48 .
and i would make a million dollar bet , that alabama is at the same address .
marty , take the car , go get her .
bring her dumb ass back here .
i think i' il keep lover boy here entertained .
hey , marty !
what the fuck are you doing ?
i can' t find my jacket !

that was the best fucking hamburger i ever had in my life .
i' ve never had a hamburger taste this good .

he' s not worth one of your tears .
would you rather it have been me ?
is that it ? ls that what you want ?
i mean , do you love him ?

i said , do you fucking love him ?
i think what you did was ...

but you' re the last person in the world , that i expected to see this morning .
well , that' s okay , daddy , i tend to have that effect on people .

i' m dying of thirst .
now there should be , there should be a seven up in there .

i mean , is she a four alarm fire , or what ?
she seems very nice .
nice ?
daddy , " nice " is not the word .

you know , she even tastes like a peach .
you can tell i' m in love with her , can' t you ?
no , wait .
i gotta talk .
sit down !
shut up !
you give me a fucking headache .
you are so much like your mother , i can' t believe it .
you are your fucking mother , through and through .
i haven' t heard from you in three years .
you show up all of a sudden , at 8 : 00 in the morning ... ... you walk in here like a goddamned bulldozer .

you' re here because you want me to help you .
what do you need from me ?
you need money ?
no .
you still have friends on the force ?
yes , i still have friends on the force .
could you find out if they know about us ?
i don' t think they know shit .
but i want to know for sure .
you can do that .
right ?
what makes you think i could do that ?
because you were a cop .
but what makes you think that i would do that ?
because i' m your son .
oh , you' re my son .
oh , you got it all worked out , don' t you ?
look .
i mean , goddamn , i' ve never asked you for a goddamn thing .

i never did .
everybody else did , but i didn' t !
now look , i just need help , and you can fucking help me .

this guy was not just some wild flake .
that' s what i was trying to tell you before .
the guy was like a mad dog .
so , the cops , they don' t think ...
they' re not after us ?
no .
until they hear something better .
they will just assume drexl had a falling out with blue lou .

but clarence ... ... and his bitch of a girlfriend , brought this on themselves .
i implore you not to go down that road with them .
you could always take comfort in the fact you never had a choice .
i' d like to help you if i could ... ... but i haven' t seen clarence .
you see that ?
that smarts doesn' t it ?
to get slammed in the nose .
fucks you up .
you get the pain shooting through your brain ... ... your eyes fill up with water .
it' s not any kind of fun .
but , what i have to offer you , that' s as good as it' s going to get .
and it won' t ever get that good again .
we talked to your neighbors .
they saw a cadillac .
purple cadillac .
clarence' s purple cadillac , parked in front of your trailer yesterday .
mr. worley .
have you seen your son ?
i' ve seen him .
i can' t be sure of how much he told you .
in the chance you' re in the dark about some of this ... ... let me shed some light .
that whore your boy hangs around with ...
her pimp is an associate of mine .
along with other affairs he works for me in a courier capacity .
well , apparently ... ... that dirty whore found out we were going to do some business ... ... because your son , the cowboy and his flame , came into the room blazing ... ... and didn' t stop , until they were pretty sure everybody was dead .
what are you talking about ?
i' m talking about a massacre .
they snatched my narcotics .
hightailed it out of there .
would have got away with it .
but your son , fuckhead that he is ... ... left his driver' s license in the dead guy' s hand .
you know .
i don' t believe you .
that' s of minor importance .
what' s of major fucking importance is that i believe you .
where did they go ?
on their honeymoon .
i' m getting angry asking the same question a second time .
where did they go ?
they didn' t tell me .
now wait a minute and listen to me .
i haven' t seen clarence in three years .
he shows up yesterday ... ... with a young girl , saying that he got married .
he asked for some quick cash ... ... to go on a honeymoon .
he asked me if he could borrow $ 500 .
i felt like helping him .
so , i wrote him out a check .
we went to breakfast in the morning .
and that' s the last i saw of him ... ... so help me god .
they never thought to tell me where they were going .
and i never thought to ask .
vincenzo , sir .
there' s nothing there .
that' s not good .
you know .
sicilians are great liars .
the best in the world .
i' m sicilian ... ... my father was the world heavyweight champion of sicilian liars .
from growing up with him , i learned the pantomime .
there are 17 different things a guy can do when he lies ... ... to give himself away .
a guy has got 17 pantomimes .
woman has got 20 .
guy has got 17 .
but ... ... if you know them , like you know your own face ... ... they would beat lie detectors all to hell .
now what we got here is a game of " show and tell .
you don' t want to show me nothing .
but you' re telling me everything .
i know you know where they are .
so , tell me ... ... before i do some damage you won' t walk away from .
could i have one of those chesterfields now ?
sure .
you got a ... ... match ?
no wait .
don' t bother , i got one .
you' re sicilian , huh ?
yeah , sicilian .
you know ...
i read a lot .
especially things about history .
i find that shit fascinating .
here' s a fact , whether you know it or not .
sicilians were spawned by niggers .
come again ?
it' s a fact .
yeah .
you see ... ... sicilians have black blood pumping through their hearts .
and if you don' t believe me , you can look it up .
hundreds and hundreds of years ago , you see ... ... the moors conquered sicily .
and the moors are niggers .
you see , way back then ... ... sicilians were like wops from northern ltaly .
they all had blond hair and blue eyes .
but , well ...
then the moors moved in there ... ... they changed the whole country .
they did so much fucking with sicilian women .
that they changed the whole bloodline forever .
that is why blond hair , blue eyes ... ... became black hair and dark skin .
you know it' s absolutely amazing to me ... ... to think to this day ... ... hundreds of years later ... ... that sicilians ... ... still carry that nigger gene .
now this ...
no , i am quoting history .
it' s written , it' s a fact .
it' s written .
i love this guy !
your ancestors are niggers .
hey !
and your great , great , great ... ... great grandmother fucked a nigger .
and she had a half nigger kid .
now ... ... if that is a fact , tell me ?
am i lying ?
' cause you ... ... you are part eggplant .
egg !
egg !
egg !
you are a cantaloupe .
that was beautiful .
i haven' t killed anybody ... ... since 1984 .
go to this comedian' s son' s apartment .
come back with something that tells me where that asshole went .
so i can wipe this egg off my face .
fix this fucked up family for good .
hey , boss .
get ready to be happy .

you' re really in love , aren' t you ?
for the very first time in my life .

i said , it' il get you high .
hey , we got cable .
want some wine , sweetheart ?
yeah , just a little bit , i' m not much of a wine gal .
that stuff is fucking real .
this is fucking real , clarence .
i certainly hope so .
you' ve got a hell of a lot of cocaine here , man .
i know .
do you realize how much coke you have ?
no , tell me .
i don' t know , but it' s a fucking lot !
this is drexl' s coke .
no , drexl is dead , you see .
it' s clarence' s coke .
and he can do whatever he wants with it .
what clarence wants to do is to sell it .
then , we' il jump on a plane and spend the rest of our lives spending it .
you got my letter ?
you lined up a buyer for me ?
i' m not joe cocaine , okay ?
you' re an actor .
i hear these hollywood guys get it delivered to the set .
well , they do .
all right ?
they do .
maybe one day , when i' m a successful actor ... ... l' il be like one of them .
but , until that day , i don' t have anything .
all right ?
i don' t have a pot to piss in , or a window to throw it out .
all i got is fucking floyd .
if you want me to help you sell a bit at a time that' s all i can do .
no .
none of that bit at a time shit .
it' s got to be the whole enchilada in one shot .
clarence , do you have any idea how difficult that' il be ?
what the fuck you are talking about ?
i' m offering $ 500, 000 worth of white for $ 200, 000 .
that' il be difficult ?
very difficult .
that' s very difficult , understand ?
listen .
it' s difficult because you' re selling to a particular group , understand ?
fat cats , big shots .
guys who can afford $ 200, 000 .
guys who can use a whole suitcase full of cocaine .
basically , clarence , guys i don' t know .
and guys you don' t know .
and more importantly , they don' t know you .
come on , dick .
okay , clarence .
listen .
there' s one guy that i know ... ... that can help you out , clarence , but ... ... l' m not guaranteeing you anything .
is he big league ?
he' s not big league .
okay ?
but he works as an assistant to a very big movie producer named lee donowitz .
lee donowitz could afford ... ... and can use , $ 200, 000 worth of coke .
being that that' s what you have .
all right , so what did you tell him ?
what the fuck do you expect me to tell him ?
i didn' t know what was bullshit and what wasn' t .
and besides , floyd smoked the second page of the letter .
okay ?
what' s this acting class guy' s name ?
elliot .
elliot what ?
elliot blitzer .
we' il get him on the phone and arrange a meeting ... ... so we can get through all this getting to know you stuff , all right ?
where ?
where should we meet ?
roller coaster .
roller coasters .
so , you have $ 500, 000 worth of cola that you are unloading for $ 200, 000 .
you want an animal cracker ?
thanks .
wait , save the gorillas .
thanks .
so , you got ... ... $ 500, 000 worth of cola ... ... that you' re unloading for $ 200, 000 .
unloading . " that' s a hell of a way to describe a bargain of a lifetime .
where did you get it ?
where did i get it ?
i grow it on my windowsill .
the light is really good there .
i' m up high enough off the street so , you know , you can' t see it .
it works perfectly .
yeah .
where , really , where does it come from ?
where does it come from ?
coco leaves .
you' re sick .
i' m out of here .
elliot , chill out .
come on , sit down here .
all right ?
we' re here , so let' s enjoy the ride .
i' il tell you .
you have to promise you' il keep it quiet .
if dick hadn' t told me you' re good people , i' d say it' s none of your business .
this is going to be fun .
let' s go !
i got a friend in the department .
what department ?
what department ?
what do you think , eight ball ?
the police department ?
give the man a prize !
about a year and a half ago ... ... my friend got access to the evidence room .
he snagged this coke , but he' s a good cop with a family .
he had it for a year and a half ' til he found a guy he could trust .
and he trusts you ?
he trusts me , we were in 4 h together .
we' ve known each other since childhood .
i handle sales , he' s my silent partner .
he knows , if i get fucked up , i won' t drop dime on him .
okay ?
no further , you understand ?
he' s kind of paranoid , i didn' t tell you nothing .
you didn' t hear anything .
i didn' t hear anything .
all right !
here we go !
ride it out , baby !
yeah !
we' re going in for another one !
hang on , elliot !
oh , yeah , we got this puppy .
this was a good idea .
elliot looks a little green .
do i look like a beautiful blond with big tits and an ass ... ... that tastes like french vanilla ice cream ?
what ?
i said , do i look like a beautiful blond with big tits and an ass ... ... that tastes like french vanilla ice cream ?
no .
no .
then why are you telling me this bullshit ?
what , do you want to fuck me ?
clarence .
he' s sick , man .
let me handle this , all right ?
look .
you know what ?
just get it straight .
lee is not into taking risks , okay ?
he' s got a couple of guys , he' s been dealing with them for years .
they' re reliable , they' re dependable , and they' re safe .
riddle me this , batman .
if you' re so much in love , what are you doing here ?
i' m sure you' ve got better things to do than hanging around on a roller coaster .
your guy is interested because with that much shit ... ... he could play joe fucking hollywood until the wheels come off .
he can sell it , he can snort it ... ... he can play santa claus with it .
at the price he' s paying he' il be able to throw it around .
he' il be everybody' s best friend .
i' m not putting him down .
it' s his money , let him do what he wants .
but don' t expect us to hang around ... ... waiting for you guys to grow some guts , all right ?
jesus .
yeah , hello .
hi , lee .
elliot , it' s sunday .
can you tell me why i' m talking to you on sunday ?
don' t i see enough of you all week ?
i' m with that party that you wanted me to get together with , lee .
you know who i' m talking about ?
i don' t believe this .
why are you talking to me ... ... on my phone about that ?
well , because i' m standing with the guy , and he insists on talking to you .
what , are you out of your fucking mind ?
he said that if i didn' t get you on the phone , that he would leave ...
hello , lee , it' s clarence .
at last , we speak .
first , i want to tell you i' m a big fan of yours .
that' s why i want to open dr. zhivago in la .
and i need you and your abilities to distribute it .
i don' t know .
dr. zhivago is a pretty big movie .
the biggest movie you' ve dealt with .
we' re talking a lot of film here .
a man would be an idiot not to be a little cautious about a movie like that .
and , lee , you' re no idiot .
i' m not saying i' m not interested .
it' s just , being a distributor is not what i do .
i' m a movie producer , you know ?
i' m here to make good movies , nothing more ... ... and nothing , well , maybe less , sometimes .
hey !
choose a fucking lane !
not you , just an idiot ...
don' t give me the finger !
i' il fucking have you killed !
so , bottom line is i' m not paramount .
you know what i' m saying ?
i got a select few distributors .
i buy their little movies and i accomplish what i want and i get out of there .
very business like , very easy , and very little risk .
we' re talking dr. zhivago .
it' il be packing them in .
for a year ... ... two years you won' t have to deal with anybody else' s movie but mine .
nobody' s but yours .
well , what' s the rush here ?
i want to be able to announce the deal at cannes .
if i had time for a courtship , i would .
i' d take you out , hold your hand , kiss your cheek .
but i' m not in that position .
i need to know right now if you and i are in bed together or not .
if you want my movie , you must come to terms ... ... with your fear and desire .
fear and desire , huh , clarence ?
don' t you know that my films have grossed more than $ 2 . 8 billion ?
let me talk to elliot .
you want to talk to elliot ?
let me talk to elliot .
elliot .
he wants to talk to you .
hi , lee .
elliot , where do you know this guy from ?
he' s a friend of dick' s , remember ?
who the fuck is dick ?
you want me to suck his dick ?
who the fuck is dick ?
oh , who the fuck is dick ?

i don' t know about you , but they give me the creeps .
yeah , yeah , i see what you mean .

the guy up in that fucking tower , killed all them people ?
i bet you green money , the first little black dot he took a beat on ... ... that was the bitch of the bunch .
first one is tough .

elliot .

lee .
lee .
that' s right , lee .
i just gotta tell you , i really am a big fan .
coming home ln a body bag is my favorite movie .
after apocalypse now , i think it' s the best vietnam movie ever made .
wow .
thank you very much , clarence .
lee .
what ?
this guy is packing .
really .
well , i mean , i' ve been pretty scared about this whole thing .
i' m fairly confident you' re here to do business , so look .
i don' t want to be a wise guy .
if you want , i' il lay my gun on the table .
it' s up to you .
no , i don' t think that' s necessary .
boris , be nice .
make everybody some coffee .
okay ?
a pleasure to meet you .
nice to meet you , too .
honey , sit down .
relax , relax .
elliot , you look like shit .
oh , i' m sorry .
i mean , it' s completely disgusting .
if i could get a quick signature , it would be great .
whatever bonnie wants .
like my dailies , there , clar ?
is that what these are ?
you like them ?
they' re great .
they better be , they cost me enough .
what did that day cost me ?
$ 357, 000 .
elliot , i swear to god , somebody is stealing from me .
what' s this one called , anyway ?
it' s a sequel to body bag .
really ?
we don' t have a title yet , but what does joe like ?
body bags two .
oh .
that' s imaginative .
i' ve got more taste in my penis .
this guy is really fucking funny .
most of these movies that win a lot of oscars , i can' t stand them .
they' re safe , geriatric , coffee table dog shit , you know ?
we park our cars in the same garage .
it' s all right .
all they make are unwatchable movies from unreadable books .
mad max , that' s a movie .
the good the bad and the ugly ... ... rio bravo , those are movies .
and coming home in a body bag , that was a movie .
it was the only movie that won oscars with balls ... ... l mean , since deerhunter .
i don' t believe you .
what , do you like a little coffee with your sugar , or what ?
lee , i' m not satisfied until the spoon stands straight up .
give me a coffee , will you ?
my uncle roger and my uncle jerry , who were in nam ... ... saw coming home in a body bag .
they said that' s the most accurate vietnam film ... ... they had ever seen .
i' il tell you .
when veterans in that war say that about my project ... ... it makes the whole thing worthwhile .
here' s to you .
my friend , oops , i just met you .
you know why ?
i think because we got the same interests .
and you know what i' d like to do right now ?
i' d like to see dr. zhivago .
where is it ?
is there a fucking doctor in the house , or what ?
hang on a second .
when you see this , you are going to shit .
l better .
what' s the guy' s name ?
donowitz .
lee , that' s all practically uncut .
if you so desire ... ... you can cut that a lot more .
don' t worry , i' il desire .
get me another cup of coffee , will you ?
me , too , boris .
i have to hand it to you , clarence , this is not nose garbage .
this is quality stuff .
perfect merchandise .
the only trouble is ... ... when i' m offered a deal that' s too good to be true ... ... it' s because it' s a lie .
convince me you' re on the level .
convince him .
if he don' t bite , we have nothing but possession .
we got lots of sandwich shit back there , make something .
we got pastrami , nice rye ...
anybody want anything ?
you , got any aspirin ?
yeah , sure .
get him that .
well , lee , it' s like this .
you' re getting this bargain because i don' t know what i' m doing .
you' re used to dealing with professionals which i' m not .
i' m a rank amateur .
what the fuck is going on ?
what' s going on , joe ?
i can take that , sell it a little at a time ... ... and make a hell of a lot more money .
what' s going on , joe ?
elliot' s too far away .
look , this is the whole ball game , this is the fucking ball game !
i' m not saying that you' re a drug dealer , but you' re a fucking movie producer .
and you got access to all kinds of money and shit like that .
shit .
oh , joe ...
... you are fucking killing me .
wait , wait .
there , wait , quiet .
now , i can' t get a million for it , but you can .
so i' il sell it to you for $ 200, 000 .
you go make a million with it .
shit , it' s all found money to me anyway , you know ?
there he is .
me and my wife , we' re minimum wage kids , you know ? $ 200, 000 .
it means the world to us .
elliot tells me that you' re fronting for a dirty cop .
elliot wasn' t supposed to tell you anything .
he' s not a dirty cop , he' s a good cop .
he saw his chance and he took it , that' s all .
why does he trust you ?
well , we grew up together , that' s why .
if you don' t know shit , then why does he think that you can sell it ?
i bullshitted him .
you' re nuts !
he' s a wild man , this kid , clarence .
i like him .
you' re wild , i love it .
hey , lee .
i love this guy , he bullshitted him , you believe this kid ?
i love him .

amid the chaos of that day ... ... when all i could hear was the thunder of gunshots ... ... and all i could smell was the violence in the air ... ... l look back and am amazed ... ... that my thoughts were so clear and true .
that three words went through my mind endlessly .
repeating themselves like a broken record .
you' re so cool .
you' re so cool .
you' re so cool .
and sometimes clarence asks me what would i have done if he had died .
lf that bullet had been two inches more to the left .
to this , i always smile .
as if i' m not going to satisfy him with a response .
but i always do .
l tell him of how i would want to die .
but that the anguish and the want of death would fade ... ... like the stars at dawn .
and that things would be much like they are now .
perhaps .
except maybe i wouldn' t have named our son ... ... elvis .
