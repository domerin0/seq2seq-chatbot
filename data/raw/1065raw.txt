hey , punk .
i been thinkin ' ...
you been thinkin ' ?
that' s a change of pace .
got a pretty big mouth for someone so ...
don' t say it .
so short .
he ain' t short !
i' m not short .
i' m just height challenged .
what' s height challenged ?
better than bein ' brain challenged .
you wanna back that big mouth up of yours and play me one on one for your jersey ?
ox , leave him alone !
what' s the matter , calvin ?
don' t push murph , man .
would you guys just stop this ?
calvin , let' s just go .
no , no .
let me handle this .
exactly how are you gonna handle this ?
listen , if i say no ...
he beats you up .
ok .
now , if i say yes ...
he still beats you up .
and you' il lose your jersey .
listen ...
i can take him .
i mean , kobe wouldn' t back down from no challenge .
allen iverson wouldn' t back down from no challenge .
and michael jordan sure as heck is not backin ' down from no challenge ,
and neither is calvin cambridge .
e excuse me .
take a number , ox ,
because you' re about to be served .
they just don' t make these things for ... normal sized people , you know ?
that' s gotta hurt .
go on ahead and laugh if you want , but you guys won' t be laughing when i get 5 new jerseys from the family who' s gonna adopt me .
you ain' t gettin ' adopted .
yes , i will , ' cause i have a destiny .
all orphans are special .
all orphans have destinies .
maybe in books , but you wanna name a real one ?
moses .
and nelson mandela and marilyn monroe and daunte culpepper .
who plays in the nfl .
this calls for champagne .
man ...
i want a family like that to adopt me .
look how they just get along with each other .
that' s what i really want .
oh , man , why' d you do that ?
all right .
kids ...
let' s get to work .
murph : fresh candy .
reg : please ?

fresh candy . $2 . 00 .
hey , you guys wanna buy some candy ?
if you don' t buy , i don' t eat .
hey , you want some candy ?
reg : it' s for the chesterfield group home .
candy bar , anybody ?
can we have some candy ?
please , daddy ?
no .
we' il get treats inside .
girls , don' t ever give money to a kid like this .
it' s a big scam .
joad is down low !
he' s open . !
tracy reynolds , you need to pass the ball !
but tracy shoots !
and it' s nothin ' but ... rim .
and the knights lose by one .
what was tracy reynolds thinking ?
no !
no !
man !
look at the coach .
he' s on fiire !
let' s go back to work , man .
go back to work ?
nobody buys when we lose , murph .
man , you didn' t even sell half your candy .
we could lose our tv privileges ... again .
is that coach wagner ?
i think so .
s stay right here .
i' il be right back .
you have a good one .
thank you .
hey , coach .
bet you could use some candy after that one .
tough loss .
you shoulda seen it up close .
you had it won !
you diagrammed the perfect play !
sure , harrison didn' t set the low pick , but why didn' t tracy pass the ball ?
son ... that is one for the ages .
hey , wait a minute .
it' s 10 : 00 .
it' s a school night .
do your parents know you' re out this late ?
i' m an orphan .
and i' m out here selling candy so that i can raise money for the group home .
oh .
well ...
listen , how ' bout this , uh ... will that get me a chocolate bar ?
no .
i can' t charge you , coach .
i don' t even know if the money really goes to the ... to the group home .
what' s your name , son ?
my name is calvin .
calvin cambridge .
calvin , have you ever seen the knights play in the arena ?
no , sir .
well , since you won' t take my money , how about if i get you some tickets for sunday' s game ?

i will !
thanks , coach .
nice talking to you .
murph !
hello .
good to see you .
there' s , uh , children everywhere , so ...
he' s so adorable .
i' m feelin ' good about this , y' all .
today' s the day i' m gonna get adopted .
you ain' t gettin ' adopted .
none of us are .
face it .
we' re like dogs .
parents only want the puppies .
so much for me being special .
hey , things could change .
i mean , your destiny could be right here and you don' t even know it .
calvin !
where are you going ?
off to do that history homework you owe me since yesterday ?
yes , sister theresa .
ok , murph , there is a winter coat here that' s just right for you .
try it on .
sister theresa , do you know anything about these shoes right here ?
i' m not sure .
it' s a perfect fit .

they could be anybody' s .
let me take a look .

i want those sneakers .
murph !

unh .
aah !
calvin , be careful !
don' t fall !
ohh .

ox , you can rat on us to mr. b , but , uh , you' il miss the game , too .
yeah !

the knights have one more chance here to chip away at this lead before halftime .
they' re not shooting well .
open at the wing is reynolds .
he puts it up ...
oh , no good .
oh , man .
reynolds misses another shot , and that' s the end of the first half .
minnesota timberwolves out in front of the knights by 12 , and once again , the knights did not play very good basketball in the fiirst half .
hey , good half .
good half .
good half .

hi there !
oh .
playing a little checkers i see , huh ?
error .
error .
i was about to win .
so , are you the man i see about calvin cambridge ?
ok , let me get this straight ...
you guys want to have calvin play for the knights ?
right .
why ?
i been coaching 35 years .
this is the most ridiculous thing i' ve ever heard of .
well , you didn' t see him play at halftime .
hey , coach .
hi ... again .
am i gonna be a knight ?
he' s 4 1/ 2 feet tall .
i know .
can you imagine the press we' re gonna get ?
look , coach , i know attendance is in the crapper , ok , and i' m not averse to using the word " gimmick " .
this is about making money .
i see .
and speaking of money ...
ah , yes , money .
mr. bittleman , i' m prepared to make you an offer of $5, 000 for a one day contract .
ah ... well .
uh , seeing that i' m calvin' s guardian , uh ...
i do have to make certain that nobody takes advantage of him .
you mean except for you ?
hey , i resent that .
uh , mr. bittleman , uh , perhaps , uh , perhaps , uh ... an extra 2, 500 might help ease your worries .
deal .
good .
i always knew that there was something special about calvin .
wow , man , you' re on the knights .
i can' t believe you' re gonna get to play in the nba .
i still can' t believe what happened to me yesterday .
whatever i wanted to do with the rock , i could do .
whatever i wanted to do on the court , i could do .
and there he was ...
tracy reynolds , nba superstar ... and i outplayed him .
yeah , man .
and you hit that " j. " fade away .
that was a swish .
that was a swish .
you alley ooped yourself off the backboard .
yeah , that was hot .
but ... how ?
that' s a good question .
i don' t know .
all i know is that before i had these ...
sneakers .
i couldn' t play like that if my life depended on it .
murph , hand me that ball .
man ... you' re like some weird basketball cinderella .
yeah , and the clock' s gonna strike midnight if somebody finds out .
wow , i wish i was going with you .
me , too .
we' il be rooting for you .
come on , let' s go .
yeah .
hey , everybody .
hey , trace , you need to get your notebook out
' cause the kid is back to school you again .
ha ha ha .
your mama .
hey , tracy , look , i' m sorry about the other day .
no , no , no .
it' s all right , little man .
no need to be sorry , all right ?
you got lucky .
it' s all right .
hey , i' m joad .
why don' t you take the locker next to mine ?
here' s your uniform , calvin .
special ordered ... ofiicial shirt , shorts , socks , and sneakers .
uh , but i like my own sneakers .
oh ... ours aren' t good enough for the kid .
no , it' s nothing like that .
it' s just that i play better in mine .
play ?
you just have to look good .
what do you mean ?
coach , may i please ask you a question ?
sure .
coach , i have a lot of friends here tonight , and , uh ...
i was just wondering ... wondering , am i here to play ... or am i just here for show ?
calvin , i' m gonna be straight with you .
you were hired tonight just to increase attendance , not to play .
man .
but ...
i saw the tape of that halftime show you put on .
you got some game .
i am honored to have you on my team .
thanks , coach .
you bet .
whoo . !
whoo . !
we' ve got a bigger than usual crowd tonight , and a lot of it is curiosity .
the knights have a brand new player .
he' s 4 foot , 8 inch calvin cambridge , joining us straight from the playground of the chesterfield group home .
reggie , your reaction .
geoff , this is unprecedented .
i can' t imagine what the knights players are thinking .
we' il see what happens .
we' re gonna fiind out shortly .
both clubs are taking the court as we get ready for tonight' s opening tip .
go knights !
what was that ? !
admiral !
admiral !
the admiral just waved at me .
he just waved at me .
admiral !
hey ...
come on !
hey !
hey !
coach wagner of the knights has seen enough .
he wants and gets a time out .
let' s go .
let' s go .
good hustle , baby .
what ?
come on , guys .
it' s not funny .
now , offense , is there any play that' s gonna work for us tonight ?
i have an idea .
oh , man .
i' ve been watching , and they' re vulnerable from the weak side , especially to a pick set away from the hoop .
why don' t we run the give and give and go ?
you mean the give and go ?
no , see , they' il be expecting that .
have tracy feed the ball to henderson .
henderson' s gonna feed the ball to joad .
joad' s gonna pass it back to tracy .
as henderson sets the pick ,
tracy' s gonna take the shot .
i like it .
oh , no .
no .
i' m not gonna run some play by some snotty nosed kid , man .
damn straight , coach .
fine .
henderson , you' re out .
tracy , you take henderson' s slot .
calvin , you take the shot .
what ?
have you lost your mind ?
you said i could play anybody i want .
yeah , well , i didn' t mean him .
am i the coach or not ?
you are .
for now .
can you believe it , reggie ?
it looks like the kid' s gonna play .
a rousing welcome for the man they came to see , the little fella , calvin cambridge , into the game for the knights .
calvin !
run the play !
what' s he doin ' ?
run the play .
no .
would you just run the play ?
time out !
white !
why' d you call time out ?
uh ...
i gotta pee .
he' s gotta pee .
calvin cambridge is calling for a bathroom break ?
i guess when you gotta go , reggie , you gotta go .
yes !
the crowd is roaring .
that can mean just one thing .
that little guy , calvin cambridge , has taken care of business in the locker room and is back on the court .
he' s done .
ladies and gentlemen , this kid' s for real .
he can play some basketball .
## tied up , tied up ##
## you got me so ##
## you got me so ##
slam dunk over david robinson !
unbelievable !
12 seconds to go , the knights trail by 2 .
trying to find some way to actually come back and win this thing .
it' s good !
the knights win !
am i a genius or what ?
huh ?
tell me i' m a genius !
this is the nba on nbc .
calvin cambridge , the 4 foot 8 dynamo , has now signed a lucrative contract with the knights .
and no wonder , after he led them to a come from behind win over the spurs with 27 points ?
that kid was unbelievable .
did i just see the admiral saluting him at the end of the game ?
you know , cambridge' s contract makes him the youngest , and the shortest person ever to sign a deal with the nba .
he' s lean , he' s mean , he' s 13 .
yeah , now all the kids are gonna be saying ,
i wanna be like calvin " .
well , i guarantee you one thing , this orphan will not be an orphan for long .
i can' t believe you' re going on the road with the knights .
can i fit in your suitcase ?
hey , what about me ?
bittleman .
hey , calvin , this is great .
well , uh , i' m proud of you .
listen , uh , when you' re on the road , uh , people might want to adopt you .
but you should realize it' s , uh , only because you' re a celebrity now , and , uh , they' re just after your money .
besides , your contract forbids it .
wait a minute .
forbids it ?
oh , yeah .
didn' t i tell you ?
uh , i signed your contract as your guardian , so , um , as long as you' re playing for the knights , that can' t change .
hey , coach , check this out !
pretty good .
welcome to self hypnosis for the fearful flier .
during today' s peaceful flight , you' il transport yourself into a state ...
tracy .

reg , you have to help me , please .
i' m not helping you with your geometry .

good for you .
it doesn' t do us any good .
murph .
congratulations .
go get adopted .
what' s wrong with him ?
what do you think ?
i don' t know .
bittleman told me that i couldn' t get adopted .
and you believe bittleman ?
his contract says nothing about adoption .
look , why would you send all of these people here ?
calvin deserves a home .
you' re only interested in making money off him .
look , with all due respect , coach wagner , child custody law is very complex .
mr. bittleman .
just because you signed his contract as his guardian ...
i' il call you back .
i' il call you back .
wait !
i' m not through talkin ' ...
yes , what is it , calvin ?
you lied to me .
what are you talking about ?
you told me no one can adopt me .
i never said that .
look , calvin , bear in mind i have cared for you way before you were rich or famous , and all of those people in there , the only reason that they' re interested in you is because you' re famous .
i' d like to see for myself .
well , that' s fine .
i will , um ... make arrangements with the very best candidates .
what do you think about that , my big man ?
we' ve been doing musical dinner theater now over 6 years . ...
in over 27 cities . ...
mm hmm .
no more hard knock life for you , calvin .

yeah , now you know what it feels like to be in the glove .
it' s more like a mitten , gary .
the knights rallied around cambridge after that , and before it was all over , payton got the gate .
get him outta here , ref .
and kenny , how about the way
reynolds jumped in to protect cambridge ?
how about that ?
they' re startin ' to come together , rich .
the team' s gelling at this point , and with 3 games left in the season , they are only 2 wins away from their first ever trip to the play offs .
## take it to the top ##

you two together ... this works .
come on .
let' s go .
so you still haven' t met any parents you liked ?
i don' t know .
nobody seems right .
maybe nobody seems right because you already met the right person .
what right person ?
tracy .
tracy .
listen , murph ,
tracy can' t even take care of himself .
you like him .
yeah , so ?
that doesn' t mean he wants to adopt me .
well , why don' t you ask him ?
listen , reg , murph ...
tracy' s not big on families .
he doesn' t even talk to his own dad .
i mean , how can you have a dad and not talk to him ?
man , that' s nuts .
it ain' t cool .
can you do anything ?
you' re back again ?
yeah , uh , i got a surprise for you .
somebody i want you to meet .
oh , ok .
i hope she' s wearin ' a bikini .
nah , it' s not a woman .
it' s it' s your number one fan .
well , it has to be a woman , right ?
calvin , why' d you bring him here ?
this is your dad .
you don' t want to talk to him ?
listen to me .
now stay out of my business and get him out of here .

how could we lose to the bulls ? !
we were out of synch , especially cambridge and reynolds .
what' s the matter with you two ?

both teams need a victory to make the play offs .
man , this is personal .
it' s play off time , and my job is to shut calvin cambridge down .
besides , what does a little kid know about the play offs ?
for the knights to have any shot at winning this game ,
reynolds and cambridge better get back in synch , and cambridge better bring every weapon in his arsenal .
ha .
hey , man .

slam dunk by vince carter .
the raptors are red hot in this one .

calvin cambridge has arrived .
the crowd reacting as he comes onto the court .
however , is it too late ?
the knights are trailing by 21 points .
they have never been able to make up that kind of a defiicit .
calvin , where have you been ?
i' m sorry , coach .

nobody shows up after 3 quarters and plays .
sit on the bench .
wait a minute , coach .

here come the knights .
geoff : lf i didn' t see it with my own eyes ,
i wouldn' t have believed it .
but they' re just one point behind the raptors in this game .
we gotta steal the ball on the inbound play .
and if we don' t get the steal , who do we foul ?
they all shoot good free throws , coach .
well , we better get that steal .
ready ?
break !
let' s go .
the knights need a steal right here .
carter being guarded by cambridge .
he comes in with it .
and he' s got the ball ...

time out called by the knights .
