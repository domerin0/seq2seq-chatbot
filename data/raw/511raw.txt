it' il be like back in the day .
a few days .
okay .
okay .
for you , john .
john , why would you do that if you know it' s not my car ?
i told you to move it .
you did tell me to move it ... ... but if you' d said you were dropping a 300 pound mirror with a demon ... ... i would' ve moved it further , john .
take alvarado .
yeah , thank you .
i know what to take .
you ever think if you told me more now that maybe i could help out ?
no ?
nope .
nope ?
of course it' s a nope .
bless me , father , for i have sinned .
it' s been ... ... two weeks since my last confession .
i killed a man today .
another one .
i didn' t even see his face , i just ... ... pulled the trigger , and he went away .
most cops go 20 years without firing their guns .
why do i always know where these guys are ?
where to aim , when to fire .
i' m wondering , is there something wrong with me , father ?
something damned ?
god has a plan for you .
he has a plan for us all .
you mustn' t let your faith be overshadowed by guilt .
yeah , i' m trying .
i' m trying real hard .
isabel .
isabel .
things i' ve beaten .
things most people never even heard of .
and now i' m gonna be done in by this .
wouldn' t be the first , john .
come on , les .
you saved me before , you can do it again , right ?
this is aggressive .
twenty years ago , you didn' t wanna be here .
now you don' t wanna leave .
yeah , that' s a good idea .
john , you really need to prepare .
make arrangements .
no need .
i already know exactly where i' m going .
morning .
good morning .
good morning .
detective .
no , no , no .
angela , wait .
you don' t need to see this , okay ?
no .
give us the room , please .
isabel .
she fell from the roof ?
she jumped .
no .
look ... ... i know it' s hard to accept .
she was sick .
isabel wouldn' t kill herself .
angie .
she wouldn' t kill herself .
detective .
period .
detective .
period !
angie , there were security cameras .
hold the door .
you going down ?
not if i can help it .
a new case ?
the big score ?
the mother lode ?
the one you' ve been waiting for ?
humor me .
don' t i always ?
oh , yeah , that' s much obliged .
thank you .
how you feeling , john ?
so , what' s new ?
bullet shavings from the assassination attempt on the pope ... ... holy water ampoules from the river jordan ... ... and oh , you' il love this . screech beetle from amityville .
yeah , it' s funny to you , but to the fallen , that' s like nails on a chalkboard .
what is it , exactly , with you and bugs ?
i just like them .
yeah .
who doesn' t ?
yeah , easy there , hero .
that' s dragon' s breath .
i thought you couldn' t get it anymore .
yeah , well , i know a guy who knows a guy .
so , what' s the action ?
i just pulled a soldier demon out of a little girl .
looked like it was trying to come through .
yeah , i know how it sounds .
no , we' re finger puppets to them , john ... ... not doorways .
they can work us , but they can' t come through onto our plane .
check the scrolls anyway .
see if there' s any precedent .
sure thing , john .
anything else ?
wouldn' t happen to have anything for a ?
on the house .
all right , question .
how much longer do i have to be your slave , john ?
you' re not my slave , chas .
you' re my very appreciated apprentice .
like tonto or robin .
or that skinny fellow with the fat friend .
right .
so then why don' t i apprentice something besides driving , then , john ?
john ?
john .
i love our little talks , john .
may i take your coat , mr. constantine ?
no , thanks , i' m not gonna be staying long .
how about you , ma' am ?
oh , no , i' m not staying long either .
i really need to speak with him .
it' s important .
first come , first served .
so you' re rude no matter where you are .
father .
hi .
you have news .
yes .
yes , i spoke with the bishop .
i know what you want , son .
still keeping your all seeing eye on me , gabriel ?
i' m flattered .
well , i could offer something ... ... about how a shepherd leads even the most wayward of his flock ... ... but it might sound disingenuous .
she has to have a catholic funeral , father .
she has to .
angela , it' s still considered a mortal sin .
she didn' t commit suicide .
the bishop believes otherwise .
you know the rules .
oh , rules .
father .
david .
this is isabel .
god was the only one she ever believed loved her .
please .
i' m sorry .
i' ve been seeing some unusual soul traffic lately .
you might consider giving me an extension .
i could do your side some good these days .
you still trying to buy your way into heaven ?
what about the minions i' ve sent back ?
that alone should guarantee my entry .
how many times have i told you ?
that' s not the way this works .
why , haven' t i served him enough ?
what does he want from me ?
only the usual .
self sacrifice , belief .
oh , i believe , for chrissake .
no , no , you know .
and there' s a difference .
you' ve seen .
i never asked to see .
i was born with this curse .
a gift , john .
one that you' ve squandered on selfish endeavors .
i' m pulling demons out of little girls .
who' s that for ?
everything you' ve ever done , you' ve only ever done for yourself .
to earn your way back into his good graces .
impossible rules , endless regulations ... ... who goes up , who goes down and why .
you don' t even understand us .
you' re the one who should go to hell , half breed .
why me , gabriel ?
it' s personal , isn' t it ?
i didn' t go to church enough , i didn' t pray enough ... ... i was 5 bucks short in the collection plate .
why ?
you are going to die young ... ... because you smoked 30 cigarettes a day since you were 15 .
and you' re going to go to hell ... ... because of the life you took .
you' re fucked .
at least it' s nice out .
he always had a rotten sense of humor .
and his punch lines are killers .
john !
constantine , it' s raining !
john !
hey !
twenty two women were found buried in the assailant' s back yard .
so much damage had been done to the bodies , police had to match ...
police report she had been physically penetrated ... ... over 100 times and buried alive . found locked in a storage freezer , his head severed and his organs ...
he stuffed holly' s body into ...
the bodies ravished by the unknown ...
he used a small handsaw ...
had nearly decapitated ...
even his eyes were gouged out .
isabel .
i' m so sorry , izzy .
constantine .
dodson .
hello ?
hello .
hello ?
hey .
hey , buddy , got a light ?
should' ve minded your own business , exorcist .
i know where you' re going , john .
you' re going to midnite' s .
you' re supposed to wait in the cab .
it' s a haven for those who rise and fall .
i remember reading about this , john .
you read too much , kid .
it' s a bar .
it' s a bar ?
it' s a bar .
papa midnite is a crusader for good .
he swore the oath of neutrality .
john , the man' s a legend .
yeah .
can you please get me into this bar , john , please ?
i' m begging you , john , please ?
sure , you can get in .
i can get in ?
if you can get in .
if i can get ?
it' s a bear , though , right ?
or two ducks in a cloud ?
two frogs on a bench .
two frogs on a bench .
no , no , i' m with the guy you just
john !
john !
i' m with him , though .
rat in a dress .
of course it is .
rat in a dress .
i' m just testing .
i' m just testing .
don' t get up .
you' ve been absent some time .
have you come here with relics to sell ?
no , i' m out of that now .
i' ve been too busy .
perhaps peddling forgeries has ended up being bad for your health .
midnite , jesus ... ... i thought the thing was authentic .
i see now .
your health is bad for other reasons .
how long ?
a few months , maybe a year .
i thought i heard thunder last night .
must have been satan' s stomach growling .
you' re the one soul he' d come up here himself to collect .
so i' ve heard .
well , i am most certain you did not come here ... ... for a sympathetic shoulder to cry on .
a demon just attacked me , right out in the open on figueroa .
they don' t like you , john .
how many have you deported back to hell ?
not some angry half breed , midnite .
a full fledged demon , here , on our plane .
clearly i do not have to remind you that is impossible .
and yesterday i saw a soldier demon ... ... trying to chew its way out through a little girl .
listen , john , demons stay in hell , angels in heaven ... ... the great dtente of the original superpowers .
thanks for the history lesson , midnite .
you' ve been a tremendous help .
now ... ... i need to use the chair .
john , forgetting the fact that it would almost certainly kill you ... ... you know i am neutral .
and as long as the balance is maintained , i take no sides .
before you were a bartender ... ... you were one witch doctor against , what , 30 ashgar ?
and i  you were constantine .
the john constantine .
once .
this isn' t the usual game , i can feel it .
something' s coming .
spooky .
balthazar .
that expression alone has made my entire night .
i' il make your night .
i' il deport your sorry ass right where you stand , you half breed shit !
you know the rules of my house .
while here , you will abide by them .
johnny boy .
word is you' re on your way down .
fresh meat .
finger licking good .
we have a meeting now , john .
what ?
i didn' t catch that .
welcome to my life .
mr. constantine .
i saw you  i remember .
and then i saw you at the  regular kismet .
i' d like to ask you a few questions , if that would be okay .
i' m not really in the talking mood right now .
well , maybe you could just listen then .
please ?
always a catch .
my sister was murdered yesterday .
sorry to hear .
thanks .
she was a patient at ravenscar .
she jumped off the roof .
thought you said she was murdered .
yeah , well , isabel wouldn' t have taken her own life .
yeah , what kind of mental patient kills herself ?
that' s just crazy .
look , i' ve heard your name around the precinct .
i know the circles you travel in .
the occult , demonology , exorcisms .
just before my sister was committed , she became deeply paranoid .
she started talking about demons , angels .
now , i think someone got to her , mr. constantine .
i think they brainwashed her into stepping off that roof .
some kind of legion or cult .
sounds like a theory , detective .
good luck .
i thought with your background , you could at least ... ... point me in the right direction .
yeah , okay , sure .
it wasn' t a suicide .
my sister was a devout catholic .
do you understand that ?
if she took her own life
her soul would go straight to hell ... ... where she' d be ripped apart over and over in screaming , brutal agony ... ... for all eternity .
that it ?
that about right ?
goddamn you .
detective .
what if i told you that god and the devil made a wager ... ... a kind of standing bet for the souls of all mankind ?
i' d tell you to stay on your meds .
humor me .
no direct contact with humans .
that would be the rule .
just influence .
see who would win .
okay , i' m humoring you .
why ?
who knows .
maybe just for the fun of it .
no telling .
oh , so it' s fun .
it' s fun when a man beats his wife to death , when a mother drowns her baby .
and you think the devil is responsible ?
people are evil , mr. constantine .
people .
you' re right .
we' re born capable of terrible things .
then sometimes something else comes along and gives us just the right nudge .
well , this has been real educational ... ... but i don' t believe in the devil .
you should .
he believes in you .
it' s a power outage .
not likely .
what ?
we should go .
now .
what is that ?
wings .
maybe talons .
you' re kidding .
of what ?
something that' s not supposed to be here .
that' s really not going to help .
close your eyes .
why ?
suit yourself .
demons stay in hell , huh ?
tell them that .
don' t worry .
happens to everyone the first time .
it' s the sulfur .
sulfur .
what were those things ?
demons .
scavengers of the damned .
no , no .
it' s impossible .
yeah .
and i don' t think they were after me .
you really believe she wouldn' t commit suicide .
isabel ?
never in a million years .
well , let' s be sure .
let' s see if she' s in hell .
oh , was it supposed to be hot or cold ?
in front of the chair .
i can' t believe i' m doing this .
these are all isabel' s things ?
yeah .
how about the cat ?
duck ?
yeah , why ?
duck .
oh , you think that' s strange .
cats are good .
half in , half out anyway .
if this is some kind of spell or something ... ... don' t you need candles and a pentagram for it to work ?
why , do you have any ?
this is crazy .
yes .
i need you to leave .
i' m sorry ?
angela , please .
the apartment .
okay .
be careful with that cat .
god , i hate this part .
isabel .
constantine .
angela .
jesus .
constantine , what ?
twins .
jesus .
what ?
you were twins .
what did you say ?
she killed herself .
what ?
and she' s damned for it .
how is this possible ?
i need to eat .
hey !
hey , what are you doing in here ?
relax , man .
slow down !
what the hell kind of place is this ?
john .
when i was a kid , i could see things .
things humans aren' t supposed to see .
things you shouldn' t have to see .
my parents were normal .
they did what most parents would do .
they made it worse .
you think you' re crazy long enough ... ... you find a way out .
you tried to kill yourself .
i didn' t try anything .
officially , i was dead for two minutes .
but when you cross over ... ... time stops .
take it from me , two minutes in hell is a lifetime .
when i came back ... ... i knew ... ... all the things i could see were real .
heaven and hell are right here .
behind every wall , every window .
the world behind the world , and we' re smack in the middle .
angels and demons can' t cross over onto our plane .
so instead we get what i call half breeds .
the influence peddlers .
they can only whisper in our ears , but a single word can give you courage ... ... or turn your favorite pleasure into your worst nightmare .
those with the demon' s touch ... ... like those part angel , living alongside us .
they call it the balance .
i call it hypocritical bullshit .
so when a half breed breaks the rules ... ... i deport their sorry ass straight back to hell .
i don' t get them all ... ... but i' ve been hoping to get enough to ensure my ...
... retirement .
i don' t understand .
i' m a suicide , angela .
when i die , the rules say i' ve got just one place to go .
you' re trying to buy your way into heaven .
what would you do if you were sentenced to a prison ... ... where half the inmates were put there by you ?
i guess god has a plan for all of us .
god' s a kid with an ant farm , lady .
he' s not planning anything .
when we were little ... ... isabel saw things too .
dodson .
guard spotted him groping the body , then he ran across the street .
came in here , and he had a go at the entire stock .
he drowned himself in alcohol in under a minute .
could' ve been a member of my fraternity .
hey , what the hell is he doing here ?
he' s okay .
why didn' t you call me , you son of a bitch ?
yes ?
what do you mean ?
what ?
how ?
got it .
bye .
i need to see where isabel died .
sances , ouija boards , channeling .
our father thought she was just trying to get attention .
she certainly did that .
she' d tell everyone about the things she said she saw .
she' d scare my mother half to death .
and then she stopped talking for almost a year .
so you had her committed .
yeah .
how long ?
two weeks .
this time .
she' d get better , and then she' d get worse .
recently , a lot worse .
that symbol that was cut in the dead guy' s hand ... ... does it have something to do with this ?
i' m a cop , john , remember ?
you don' t walk off the roof of a building without leaving something behind .
and i showed you everything she left behind in that box , but feel free .
maybe she left something else .
not something a cop would find .
something just for you .
you were her twin , angela .
twins tend to think alike .
i' m not like my sister .
but you were once .
when you were kids .
when you' d spend every second with each other .
you' d start a sentence , she' d finish it .
you' d get hurt , she' d cry .
that was a long time ago .
that kind of bond doesn' t just disappear .
there is nothing here .
hey .
come on .
she planned her death in this room .
she thought it up right here .
right where you' re standing .
she knew you' d come .
she counted on you to see what she saw ... ... feel what she felt , know what she knew .
what did she do , angela ?
how should i know ?
what did she do , angela ?
i don' t know .
what would you do ?
i don' t know .
what did she do , angela ?
you know what she did .
what did she do , angela ?
you know what she did .
what are you afraid of ?
what did she do ?
what did she do ?
i don' t know !
when we were girls ... ... we would leave each other messages .
in light .
in breath .
on the windows .
john , there is no 17th act in corinthians .
corinthians goes to 21 acts in the bible in hell .
they have bibles in hell .
paints a different view of revelations .
says the world will not end by god' s hand ... ... but be reborn in the embrace of the damned .
though if you ask me ... ... fire' s fire .
16 : 29 , 16 : 30 .
oh , my , this is certainly not good .
the sins of the father would only be exceeded by the sins of the son .
whose son ?
but he can' t cross over , b.
impossible to cross over .
whose son ?
god' s son ?
no , the other one .
devil had a son too .
here it is .
this is the sign of mammon ... ... the son of the devil .
well , hold on , it says here
