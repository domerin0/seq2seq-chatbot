## [ girl vocalizing ]
once upon a time , there was a little girl
just like any other little girl .
and like most little girls  [ girl ]
i gotcha ! she loved collecting beautiful things .
look it what i have .
always sharing them with her friends .
hel lo .
come on over and meet my friends , hoppers .
she would throw the most amazing tea parties for her very closest companions .
mr. elephant , have you met my daddy ?
he' s the governor , you know .
and then it happened .
you know that awkward but typical time oflife ...
when you feel like every eye is on you  [ man ]
mackenzie !
iike you' re the main attraction in a three ring circus .
that' s right .
she became a teenager .
but eventually , she made it through .
and as she blossomed , she became more comfortable with herself .
there she is .
hey , sam .
how you doi ng ?
h i , dad .
h i , sweetie .
i ' d like you to meet
and like most teenagers , she enjoyedparties ...
andpizza .
enjoy .
thanks .
and like herpeers ... she often felt as ifher every move was scrutinized .
hold it right there .
big smile , sam .
mom , prom ise me you would never let me leave the house looking like that .
never !
it looks like she found chelsea clinton' s old crimping iron ... and amy carter' s sassoons .
it' s like a terrorist got a hold ofher .
i don' t know what' s going on .
but what doyou think ?
what is the worst outfit thatyou have everseen samantha wear ?
i' il bet it' s gonna be close .
i bet it is too .
there have been a lot of lousy outfits .
ifmac is back , get in there and clean outyourkid' s closet .
but with maturity ...
thank you .
she was able to look outside herself ... and appreciate the wisdom ofher elders .
and i ' il tell you something .
decades in politics give you ... special life skills , sam .
like an excellent poker face .
not bad , senator downer .
thankyou for the tip .
in short ...
she grew up ... happily ...
good night . with the love ofa father ...
good night , sam . and a mother ...
seeyou in the morning , sweetheart . who she thought were the center ofthe world ... in an old white house ... they called home .

somethi ng wrong with sam .

travel time , four hours , 59 minutes .
twenty five minutes to destination redmond univ
hold that thought , liz .
let' s pretend that tomorrow i' m heading offto college .
mm hmm .
i grab my bags , which i packed myself .
i throw them into my adorable collegiate car ... next to my cooler that has a beer hiding underneath the bologna sandwiches .
my parents cry .
their only child is growing up and so forth .
and then i do it .
i drive offlike the normal , run of the mill kid that i am .
you' restillaprincess .
youshouldat least weara ball gown .
ignorance is bliss .
what can i say ?
i say , good night , normal , boring girl .
and you better hide that beer , because under the sandwiches that' s the first place they' il look .
duly noted .
goodnight .
did you take the southern route through the stairwell ... or the northern route through the access hall ?
eastern route .
oh !
two elevators , one moving walkway , turn left at the lincoln arches .
it' s lesser known , but very effective .
mm hmm .
eastern route' s one of my favorites , actually .
and that lincoln arches thing is a very nice touch .
you know , ifyou' re gonna eat this cake ... you have to pay the toll .
inflation .
mm hmm .
you know , you should really do something about that , dad .
mm hmm .
mm , mm , mm , mm .
not the dancing .

## [ humming ]
ready ?
ready .
good .
i need to say something .
okay .
about tomorrow .
i was thinking  mm hmm . and maybe i should go alone .
really ?
yeah .
i mean ... it' s hard enough to blend in , having a team of secret service men carrying my books , then
uh huh .
all i' m saying
i just wanna be like everybody else .
sam , you' re not like everybody else .
ready ?
it' s the big finish .
here it comes .

don' t worry , liz .
i' m set .

got it .
thankyou .
so , you' re just like any other american family .
whose daughter is heading offto college .
remember , todayyou' re not just the first lady , butyou' re also a mom .
i' d like to think i' m both women every day .
in short , you' re just a proud dad .
like every other dad ... watching his little girl head offto california for college .
you can segue intoyour education reform initiative from there .
and time permitting , mr. president , the california youth literacy program .
it' s not a stump speech .
it' s about my daughter .
right .
mr. president , how doyou feel aboutyour only child ... going to school so far away ?
well , uh , i could suggest moving the nation' s capitol to california .
samantha , will you miss d. c. ?
andbetteryet , what willyou miss least ?
wow .
that' s a tough one .
well , i can' t tell you what i will miss the least ... but i can tell you what i will miss the most .

that' s all i' m asking .
well , the situation could have its advantages .
absolutely .
like , in case ofa national emergency ... guess who gets a free seat on the chopper ?
i was kind ofthinking your secret service could get us beer .
you can forget about that .
we' il work on it .
mia thompson , arkansas royalty .
i didn' t know they had royalty in arkansas .

in the sense theywould support preferredpolicy .
ofcourse , the fundamental importance ofagenda control ... was established by mckelvey ... i rrespective of i m pl ications for the fi nal outcome .
in fact , one ofhis most notable papers showed ... that the one person , one vote ... system ofvoting ... did not always lead to a middle ground in decision making .
the manipulation ofagenda could have a great impact on policy making .
you m issed a great party .
sorry about that .
fortunately , i can provide you ... with another normal college experience ... in which the roommate kicks you out in the name of [ grunts ]
higher education .
can i just get my

with guaranteed results .
ifyou have ring around the toilet
i llegal motion .
take a look at this .
with embroidery on the sleeves .
with embroidery around the neck .
with a front closure .
it' s verybeautifully done .

there is a precedent for reduced security .

sir , she' s miserable .
okay .

on behalfofthe redmond knights , i wanna thank each and every one ofyou .
what we do on the field would not be possible ... without whatyou do offthe field .
are you al i ri ght ?
okay , i need backup .
i real ly i i ke this guy .
what happened to all the ones you' ve been kissing since school started ?
when i really like a guy , it means i' m not gonna kiss him .
all right .
long story short , we went to school together ... and i' ve loved him ever since spandex was in .
i asked him to meet me here tonight , but ...
i never thought he would .
your offensive captain, john young .
give it up forbig buck rich on defense .
hi , samantha .
welcome to redmond .

excuse me .
it' s always about you , sam .

## [ woman singing hip hop ]

so , mia , did you talk to her about rushing yet ?
not yet .
hey , did you invite her to our party ?
you still wanna invite her afterwhat happened at the last one ?
are we supposed to salute orsaythe pledge ofallegiance ?
hands off the roommate' s personals .
only i can touch ' em .
dude , can' t believe we' re partying in , like , dorm room one .
hey , mia , what' s she like ?
get to see her naked ?
can we all just stand in line to kiss her ass ?
i' m so sick of all things samantha .
does she have a boyfriend ?
she is so hot .
oh, yeah .
i don' t believe that' s any ofyour business .
## [ continues , indistinct ]
what' s going on , mia ?
what' s going on is this isn' t working out .
it' s too hard .
is it thatyou don' t like living with all the attention , mia ?
orthatyou don' t like living without it ?
excuse me ?
i thinkyou' re used to being the center ofthings .
as a matter offact , i am .
naturally .
normally .
whatyou got going on is a whole lot of genetic limelight .
i think thatyou' re acting really unreasonably right now .
sowhy don' twejust step outside .
maybe calm down .
no , i' m not counting to 1 0 .
i' m notwriting up some itinerary .
right here , right now , let' s have this out .
and for once , sam , say something thatyou wanna say ... and not what someone wrote foryou .
just beyou .
whoever that is .
this from a woman who will kiss anyone with lips ... but saves abstinence for the one person she really cares about ?
well , you know what ?
at least i can admit i' m messed up .
you' re so desperate to make everybody like you , you let people use me to get toyou ... and then you act like you don' t see what' s happening .
you let people useyou , regardless ofwhether i am around , mia .
you make that choice all ofthe time ... so don' t blameyour genetically lit roommate .
and don' t draw on my parents .
it' s not nice .
## [ woman singing hip hop ]

mm mmm .
reduced security or not .
i just have to face it .
my life will never be normal .
and what exactly is so bad about that ?
the last time i had privacy i was in utero .
imagine what it' s like to have yourwhole life picked out foryou .
imagine ... never being alone and always feeling lonely .
all i everwanted was to get mykey ... get in a beat up little volkswagen , and drive offto college .
you think i' m a silly , spoiled kid , completely devoid of gratitude .
actually , i think i completely understand what you' re going through .
you do ?
this one time , i won the class spelling bee .
i couldn' t get from point " a " to point " b " without people watching my every move .
i had to avoid the press , the paparazzi .
and the women .
my god , the women , sam .
the number of training bras that were left in my locker ... could fill the support needs of an entire country .

as your father , i couldn' t live with myself if something ever happened to you .
as a president ... this country can' t afford to have anything happen toyou right now .
what could i do , sam ?
what choice did i have ?
you had the choice to be honest with me .
you had the choice not to lie to me as my father and as the president .
oh , man .
hon , i knowyou thought he was your friend .
ifyou want , [ inhales ] we can replace him .
won' t he lose his job ?
he' il be transferred from first family detail , but no .
no find another position .
but not the right position .
he' s in line to work for me .
and , yeah , that' s where most agents want to end up .
no .
he can stay .
i really hope someday you understand this .
i do .
that is what is so disappointing .
i thought i' d finally found someone who' d like me for me .

what are you doing here ?
what have you been doing here ?
been a three point drop in the polls ... since your little table dance .

you' ve gotta know that we are in the race of our lives .
we were elected to set an example .
they expect more of us .
that' s the life we' ve chosen .

nobody elected me , remember ?
like it or not , chosen or not ... you are the daughter ofthe president ofthe united states .
your father and i need you .

mackenzie !
we' re here to discussyourproposed removal as a disciplinary action .
your record is exceptional , but looking at this report ...
i have my doubts about your abi i ity to conti nue as an agent .
i understand .
so please tell this panel why we should allow you to continue as an agent .
my fatherwas an agent .
and my grandfatherwas before  but they' re not the ones underreview here .
you are .
and ifyou had a different father or grandfather , you wouldn' t have this opportunity .
you know , as a little kid ...
i always dreamt about standing on the sidelines ofhistory , protecting others maybe even the president himself .
well , i had the opportunity to protect a pretty remarkable person .
do you have anything to say to defend your actions ?
you trainedme to expect the unexpected .
and i tried ... not to feel anything .
i tried to keep my distance ... but i ... fell deeper ... and deeper .
ifhaving those feelings means losing myjob ... then that' s a loss i am prepared to take .
you and i know that mistakes made in our line ofwork could mean someone' s life .
so i' m sorry .
you' il be on suspension pendingyourremoval ... andyou shouldstart to think about other alternatives .
have we confirmed these numbers ?
and did she sign for them ?
well , the only thing  well , that' s why we chose this venue .
new hampshire worked , right ?
we ' re not in new hampshire anymore .
most people want to hear about foreign markets .
pardon me .
hey .
how are you doin ' ?
good .
you okay ?
sam ... you' re unhappy .
i get it .
but ifyou' re going to be here , be here .
because there' s a lot at stake ... and i really need you to act like a grown up right now .
obviously , i understand there is a lot at stake , dad .
i have been standing byyour side with mom my entire life .
that' s why i came home .
you don' t have to tell me how important it is to be with the peopleyou love .
i am here .
ifyou want me to be a grown up , then you have to allow it .
what' s goin ' on with sam ?
uh
what is it ?
well ... rememberwhen she was little and she found that frog ... and we wouldn' t let her keep it ... and she got that really stubborn little ... unbelievably cute look on her face ?
yes .

with all due respect , now that we' ve just taken direct hits ... on the domestic agenda , and it' s the last push before the election
it' s too late to change our position .
