at least ...
i loved her .
may she rest in peace .

from the moment the alarm sounds , you will have four minutes to enter the code into the microcomputer processor .
induction into the program .
when the alarm sounds , either you or your partner must input the code .
it is highly recommended that you and your partner take alternating shifts .
in this manner , you will stay as fresh and alert .
it is most important that when the alarm sounds , the code be entered correctly and in a timely fashion .
do not attempt to use a computer for any
congratulations .
until your replacements arrive , the future of the project is in your hands .
on behalf of the degroots ,
alvar hanso and all of us at the dharma initiative , thank you , namaste , and good luck .
all right .
so you' ve been pushing that button every two hours since you got down here .
that' s right .
how' s that even work ?
i' ve set up 2 person shifts , 6 hours .
everyone' s on the roster .
don' t they want to know why ?
i think the film is pretty self explanatory .
really ?
all i heard was something about electromagnets and an incident .
what about all the missing pieces ?
oh , you mean the splices ?
yeah , just a frame here and there , i think , nothing important .
what do you think ?
about the film , what do you think ?
i' m sorry i missed it , her funeral .
i ...
i had to be with sawyer , so ...
why aren' t you with him now ?
' cause i' m going crazy .
do you believe in ghosts , sayid ?
i saw walt in the jungle just before shannon was shot .
does that make me crazy ?
it' s a long drive back to the arraignment .
you comfy ?
why now ?
what ?
nice corn fed farm girl like yourself , no history of violence , straight a' s , no record , a couple of speeding tickets .
i just gotta wonder , why' d you kill him now ?
oh , right , yeah , don' t tell me .
you wouldn' t want to incriminate yourself , not after you were so smart planning it .
that jury back in iowa sure ain' t gonna get hung upon premeditation .
and a gas leak ?
come on , it' s amateur hour from top to bottom .
it sounds like you' ve got it all figured out .
i do have you all figured out .
you don' t know anything about me .
white trash mom divorces dad , starts up with some guy who' s a drinker , maybe he knocks her around a little bit , and so she marries him because , you know , that' s what happens .
and then this drunk , this wayne , he moves into your house , and you get to lay there every night and listen to him doing your mom right there in your daddy' s old bedroom .
and even that wouldn' t be so bad if he didn' t beat her up all the time .
but she loves him , she defends him .
if that don' t make a person want to kill somebody , i don' t know what does .
but the question is , now ?
why now ?
why after all these years did you just decide to blow poor wayne up ?
he come knocking on your door late at night ?
he never touched me .
look out !
get ... get off !
well , why can' t you just put the numbers in now ?
no , it doesn' t work that way .
the alarm goes off in four minutes .
you can' t type anything till then .
you mind if i check out some of this hardware ?
sure .
just don' t break it .
hello again .
hello .
i have something i think you should see .
if you don' t mind , i will begin at the beginning .
long before christ , the king of judah was a man named josiah .
boy , when you say " beginning , " you mean beginning .
at that time , the temple where the people worshipped was in ruin , and so the people worshipped idols , false gods , and so the kingdom was in disarray .
josiah , since he was a good king , sent his secretary to the treasury and said , " we must rebuild the temple .
give all of the gold to the workers so that this will be done .
but when the secretary returned , he had no gold .
and when josiah asked why this was , the secretary replied ...
we found a book .
do you know this story ?
no , afraid i don' t .
what the secretary had found was an ancient book , the book of law .
you may know it as the old testament .
and it was with that ancient book , not with the gold , that josiah rebuilt the temple .
on the other side of the island , we found a place much like this .
and in this place , we found a book .
i believe what' s inside there will be of great value to you .
hey .
so rose' s husband' s white .
didn' t see that one coming .
is there something you need , hurley ?
no .
just taking a walk , thought i' d say " hey .
who' s taking care of sawyer ?
sun is .
so you' re , like , mad at him ?
why would i be mad at sawyer ?
maybe ' cause he' s the one always comes down here and chops wood and now you are .
it' s , like , transference .
what are you , a shrink now ?
well , that' s what they call it in the mental hospital .
i' m not mad at anyone .
where' s jack ?
i don' t know .
he didn' t come back .
has he said anything ?
sawyer ?
no , he' s still sleeping .
can you watch him ?
i can stay if you  no .
yeah , i can .
thanks .
uh huh .
yes , i' m sure that' s the exact form you' ve got .
uh huh .
i' il send one over to you , right .
i' il call you back later .
hi , dad .
katie , the police and the u. s. marshals are looking for you .
you shouldn' t have come here .
i' ve been waiting outside for 2 hours .
they' re not here .
is it true what they' re saying ?
katie , what did you come here for ?
why didn' t you tell me , dad ?
tell you what ?
i was making a scrapbook , a surprise for your birthday , so i called one of your c. o. s to get some pictures of you in uniform .
the pictures that he sent me had dates on the back , photos of you in korea up until four months before i was born .
why didn' t you tell me that wayne was my father ?
why ?
i didn' t tell you because i knew you' d kill him .
and your mother ...
loved him .
you were 5 years old .
i wanted to take you along with me .
she wouldn' t let me .
so why didn' t you kill him ?
because i don' t have murder in my heart .
i' m gonna have to call ' em .
can i have an hour ?
bye , daddy .
can you hear me ?
sawyer ?
wayne ?
i' m probably crazy , and this doesn' t matter ,
but maybe you' re in there .
somehow you asked me a question .
you asked me why i ... why i did it .
it wasn' t ' cause you drove my father away or the way you looked at me or because you beat her .
it was ' cause i hated that you were a part of me , that i would never be good , that i would never have anything good .
and every time that i look at sawyer , every time i feel something for him ,
i see you , wayne , and it makes me sick .
that' s about the sweetest thing i' ve ever heard .
sawyer ?
who the hell is wayne ?
where am i ?
a bunk bed ?
yeah , you' re in a bunk bed .
are we saved ?
no , sawyer .
not yet .
voil .
what are the odds ?
the odds ?
yeah .
here , hold this down on the table here , nice and flat .
i mean , think about it .
somebody made this film .
someone else cut this piece out .
we crash .
two halves of the same plane fall on different parts of the island .
you' re over there .
i' m over here .
and now here' s the missing piece , right back where it belongs .
what are the odds ?
don' t mistake coincidence for fate .
you' ve gotta be kidding me .
air lock' s over this way .
oh .
come on , admit it .
we' ve been rescued .
you got it ?
sorry .
watch yourself .
son of a bitch .
watch yourself , okay ?
okay .
home sweet home .
yeah .
i really thought you were yanking my chain .
what do you keep smiling at ?
you need a haircut .
oh , really ?
maybe you ought to take me back inside .
you see that ?
if you mean the big ass horse standing in the middle of the jungle , then , yeah .
you know that horse , freckles ?
yeah , i do .
tequila and tonic .
that' s your drink , right ?
where' s the tonic ?
we' re running a little low on mixers .
sure you want to waste that on me ?
i figured you could use a drink .
i know i could .
you' re gonna try to convince me that everyone here doesn' t hate me ?
only if you' re gonna try to convince me that every woman in the world' s not crazy .
when the alarm sounds , either you or your partner must input the code .
it is highly recommended that you and your partner take alternating shifts .
in this manner , you will both still stay as fresh and alert .
it is most important that when the alarm sounds , the code be entered correctly and in a timely fashion .
here it comes .
do not attempt to use the computer for anything else other than the entering of the code .
this is its only function .
the isolation that attends the duties associated with station 3 , may tempt you to try and utilize the computer for communication with the outside world .
this is strictly forbidden .
attempting to use the computer in this manner will compromise the integrity of the project and worse , could lead to another incident .
i repeat , do not use the computer for anything other than entering the code .
congratulations .
until your replacements arrive , the future of the project is in your hands .
hello ?
hello ?
who is this ?
this michael .
who is this ?
dad ?
