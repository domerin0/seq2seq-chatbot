lynn !
there you are !
i didn' t see you there .
you are shameless .
that woman was 6 months pregnant .
which is the reason i flirted with her .
it made her day .
it made her feel really good .
so , it was out of compassion , right ?
i m working on it .
good .
what about the other woman ?
blind .
blind .
blind ... like love .
so what about tonight ?
am i going to see you ?
should i come to the restaurant ?
tonight' s not good .
it' s ... so busy tonight .
i don' t think so .
maybe i' il come by and surprise you .
i don' t like surprises actually , no .
come on !
i m looking to see the chilean sea bass .
it' s not on the sideboard ?
no .
i see no bass .
i m gonna kill that son of a bitch !
fakir !
did you move my fish ?
i m talking to you .
did you move my fish ?
could it be this one lying here disguised as an artic char ?

what happened to lynn ?
i believe i baked that cake .
light up the oven .
there' s a fresh bowl of batter at the door .
i m an easy going guy , right ?
i m good to my staff .
i treat them well .
is that a mistake ?
because , an occasion , one of them has stepped over the line and said very ... familiar things about my private life .
if i didn' t feel like ...
i was leading these poor women to the slaughter one after the other ...
i could build a shute to keep a count by the front door .
so , warning you has no effect ?
no .
it' s like a greek tragedy , isn' t it ?
ok guys , i' ve got bad news .
i m kicking you out ... so other people may eat .
here are your checks .
the good news is the bar drinks are on me .
tommy ?
you got it .
thanks .
lady , what am i gonna do with you ?
you' re killing me .
us ?
come on !
how about i set you up out on the patio ?
out on the patio ?
before my bartender leaves his wife .
i was divorcing her anyway .
restrain yourself , tommy .
eriko ...

it' s frantic tonight , a madhouse .
can you bear with me 2 minutes ?

honey , are you feeling alright ?
you look sort of sea foam green .
i m fine .

he' s how old ?
who cares ?
lf he' s rich as well , you might have a fight on your hands .
i want you all to meet an old chum of mine .
he' s irresistible .
he' s will keane .
and he owns this overpriced establishment .
overpriced ?
i can' t believe you' d say ...
where else are you gonna find a beet salad ... for under 35 bucks ?
i loved the chilean sea bass .
i' m shannon .
shannon .
thank you .
i m simon .
hi simon .
nice to meet you .
you too .
may i ask whose birthday this is ?
the birthday girl happens to be my granddaughter , charlotte .
it s not katie' s daughter ?
you bet .
she' s got katie' s eyes , hasn' t she ?
and talent !
forget about it .
do you know that this kid made from scratch all these crazy hats ?
they' re great .
then she got serious with mine .
pretty sassy , isn' t it ?
very elegant .
isn' t it divine ?
you' re not kidding about this ?
have i ever lied to you ?
no , it' s wonderful .
really wonderful work .
do you speak ?
thank you .
so , you' re katie' s daughter .
so that makes you about ...
twenty two and never been kissed .
no , i don' t buy that .
happy birthday , charlotte .
thank you .
great to see you again , dolly .
great to see you , will .
go right in there .
there you go .
great seeing you .
bye .
be still my beating heart .
or , is that yours ?
i think it' s mine .
he' s cute but he' s a little old for charlotte .
he' s simply fabulous .
how do you know him ?
from newport .
he' s an old friend of your mom' s .
thanks , melissa .
good night .
when will keane comps 3 bottles of crystal to an underage girl , i know what' il happen .
she' s not underage .
she' s 22 .
i know her grandmother .
tell me you' re not gonna date her .
the grandmother ?
i promise i m never touching that woman .
you know what' s wrong with people like you ?
too much sex .
it melts the brain .
here we go .
no worry about that around our house .
i m on your side .
i m the good guy .
i m sorry .
i melt at least 3 times a week .
is he lucky i m off the market or what ?
they wouldn' t even look at him .
you hear ?
they wouldn' t look at you .
you' re going to do this , aren' t you ?
what is it with you two ?
will you give me some credit ?
i smile at this girl , she bushes from head to toe .
why would i do this ?
knock it off .
you' d kill to be in his place .
okay bitch , i m ready .
not me !
can we start with " good morning " ?
my god , i m so sorry .
who is this ?
guess .
you ?
i guess .
who' d you think it was ?
my friend , simon .
he always call me the morning after to ... dish .
do you want to talk to my grandmother ?
no , i was calling you .
you were ?
i got this little problem .
i thought you could help me out .
i got a benefit coming up .
one of those ... black tie worthy cause , lousy food kind of thing .
and i was wondering ...
i' d like you to make a hat ... for me .
actually , not for me , it' s for my date .
i don' t wear hats , except to yankee games .
the problem is that i don' t know her hat size and i don' t want to ask her ... because it' s a surprise .
was it that woman you were with last night ?
no .
cause she had an abnormally small head .
it might account for the limited conversation .
i could always put in an adjustable band .
that' s perfect .
wonderful .
it is risky doing it this way .
you can do it .
life rewards the courageous few .
you can do this .
can you give me a point of inspiration ?
like what ?
like an image .
this hat is like ...
like the line of a woman' s hip .
okay .
when can i have it ?
let' s say ... two weeks .
great !
i' il give you till thursday , 4 o' clock .
okay .
wow .
one other thing ...
you say " wow " an awful lot .
i know .
you' re a grown up now .
when is that going to stop ?
soon .
i' il see you thursday .
okay .
bye .
wow .
mikey , how you doing ?
i can' t complain .
you' re early , aren' t you ?
in this soup , you' re better safe than sorry .
will keane ?
visitor .
he' s going to a fancy party tonight .
he' s up on twenty four .
i' il key the elevator for you .
tony , this was not an ace parmesan from froman' s ...
tony , this was more like a pepperino from scarsdale ...
i know the difference !
it s a different price .
you' re late .
i know .
i m so sorry .
i tried to get a cab and couldn' t .
i took the subway and ...
yeah , yeah , it' s alright .
what' s the point of being young and beautiful if it' s not to keep men waiting .
in fact ...
i m disappointed .
i was looking forward to at least another half hour of suspense .
i could leave and come back .
too late .
so , whaddya got ?
try it on .
i m soaked .
it s alright .
go ahead .
try it on .
you have to imagine it on your friend .
is it the line of a woman' s hip ?
is it ?
yes .
what a shame .
why ?
she stood me up .
who ?
my date .
she called an hour ago ; said she had a cold .
it sounded more like the hiccups to me .
so , you mean you' re not going to go ?
alone ?
no , no ...
unless ...
what ?
no ... no ...
wait , no ... wait ...
no .
forget it .
no wait , what were you going to say ?
i don' t know .
i don' t know .
you wouldn' t want to go , would you ?
great .
forget it .
thanks .
thank you very much .
it' s just ...
you' ve got the hiccups !
are you kidding ?
i' d go in a heartbeat .
you' re fabulous !
yeah ?
oh dear ...
it must be me .
must be .
do you think i m too old for you ?
no , i collect antiques .
or i aspire to .
we appreciate it .
i would love to go , but i m a disaster .
i think with a little plaster and a little paint , you' re as good as new .
do you wanna see the dress ?
there' s a dress ?
if you need me for anything , i' il be in the back .
i m curious .
what made you choose my restaurant for your party ?
i had to pick a place for my party .
i read that article about you .
the magazine !
the magazine .
it' s so embarrassing .
no .
i liked it .
you don' t dance .
you float .
that' s from my dad .
i used to stand on his feet .
i was floating !
my mom was a great dancer too .
but , you knew that .
maybe .
we danced a couple of times .
now you' re dancing with me .
how weird is that ?
she was very special .
i had great parents .
i was lucky .
shall we do this ?
here you go !
do you want something to drink ?
yes , champagne please .
i' il get you one .
sit at the table and i il be over in a second .
i had to come .
i work at the museum .
what' s your excuse ?
a date ... sort of .
with will keane , right ?
yeah , do you know him ?
only by reputation .
i m lisa biloy .
i m charlotte .
nice to meet you .
nice to meet you too .
what' s he like ?
damn it , i see a huge donor disappearing .
i gotta go .
enjoy yourself .
yes , you too .
here you go .
thank you .
who was that ?
lisa somebody .
here' s to ...
us !
some people star to fall into recognizable patterns .
the next step is that ... immediately ... you know people ... on sight .
and if it' s a woman ... it' s a romance , forget it .
it' s just ... this majorly chilling effect ' cause you know exactly in the beginning ... what' s going to happen in the end .
what i like about you is i find you ... completely unprecedented ... and therefore , utterly unpredictable .
god !
that must be a relief .
what ?
to finally deliver that speech to a woman and have it apply to there .
because , coincidentally , i am all those things you just said .
yes .
and so much more .
my yoga teacher calls me a " unique " .
come again ?
a unique .
a unique .
he' s a very wise man .
are you sure he' s not hitting on you ?
it s a woman !
you are what she would call a " typical " .
really ?
yes !
really .
i can prove it too .
you want me to ?
okay , try .
alright ...
come here .
i m serious .
closer .
closer ...
close enough ?
yes .
i was hoping gravity would do the rest .
maybe i am " typical " .
we should go .
i can smell the rain .
when did i learn how to do that ?
what should we do , will ...
with this moment that we' re in ?
boy , do you look guilty .
i m thinking .
you hungry ?
yep .
didn' t anyone ever tell you it was bad manners ... to stare at a girl while she' s eating like a pig ?
this isn' t right .
you ... you are ...
young .
yes , and i am ...
old .
older .
much older .
alright , much older .
the point is ...
look , i could put this off , but i genuinely like you .
i want to be clear from the start , so there' s no confusion later on , okay ?
what i want to say to you is that ... all i m able to offer you ... is this ... what we have right now .
nothing more .
until it ends .
what i mean is .. we have no future .
i know .
i m sick .
what do you mean ?
it s my heart .
nobody even thought i' d last this long .
i could' ve put off telling you but ...
i genuinely like you .
i wanted to be clear right from the start ... so there was no chance for any confusion later .
she' s the perfect woman .
young , beautiful and on her way out .
not funny , john .
i know it' s not .
it s sad .
she' s so young .
no , i mean you' re sad .
even this , as far as it' s gone .
you shouldn' t be doing this .
why not ?
' cause it' s out of whack .
it doesn' t feel totally out of whack .
it doesn' t feel totally out of whack to you because you' re looking at her .
i m looking at you and it' s fucked .
there ain' t a right angle in it .
alright ...
i end it .
i don' t know .
make up your mind !
what do you want me to do ?
i don' t know .
maybe it' s a good thing .
maybe it makes a sad girl happy and a desperate guy think .
anyway you look at it , one thing ... treat her nice .
what do you mean , " desperate " ?
treat her nice .
well , well ...
well , well ...
she' il be right down .
she' s upstairs , gilding the lily , so to speak .
he' s here !
i m coming !
now , come on .
do come in .
these are for you , dolly .
thank you very much .
they are " loverly " .
aren' t they ... lovely ?
care for a " cock i tail " ?
yeah , sure .
scotch ?
neat , please .
my kind of guy .
sorry about the mess .
my maid died 14 years ago ... and i have found it absolutely impossible to replace her .
what can i say , will ?
time is a thief .
one day , you' re rich as an arab .
next day , you' re lucky if you can afford pistachio nuts .
it s funny .
most of us are young for what ?
about a minute and a half ?
not katie .
katie will be young forever .
so will the guy she married .
i console myself with that idea sometimes .
who' d have thought what time had in store for her .
i m sorry .
i should have called after the accident .
then , on the other hand ... time is in love with some people .
like you , for instance .
you look exactly the same !
please ...
handsome as ever .
and up to your old tricks ...
looks like to me .
look , dolly ...
leave her alone !
she' s sick .
will , she' s really sick .
what are you guys talking about ?
nothing .
just how much you look like your mom , is all .
yes ...
yes , you do .
are you ready ?
yes .
bye dolly .
don' t listen to her .
have fun !
you gotta look on the bright side .
lf i wasn' t sick ... this would not work .
there is no way that we would be sitting here .
we' re totally wrong for each other .
we' re totally wrong for each other .
i know .
i could be your father .
i prefer , uncle .
do you think we should break this off ?
afraid you might feel something ?
well , look at it this way .
we can have it real , which we both know is way better .
and , you wouldn' t have to pay full price ... because , in a year or so ...
i' d be just this sob story you could use to bag more chicks .
that is a pathetic characterization .
i don' t know .
i don' t accept that .
the stench of truth .
o world , i cannot hold thee close enough !
thy winds , they wide grey skies !
thy mists , that roll and rise !
it does feel like rain .
you wanna get a cup of coffee , and go to the west side ?
no , no .
you' d abandon the universe ... and me for a cafe late ?
no , let' s not do it .
let' s not do no thoughtless thing .
we can' t talk about he fact that you' re sick ?
i m right here , right now .
let' s talk about you .
come on , 49 years ...
48 !
all right , 48 years .
come on , tell me about it .
give it .
share it .
you look at me in a way that i haven' t quite earned .
then earn it .
earn it , please .
what do you want me to do ?
i m yours .
what is it ?
what are you doing ?
i m keeping it .
this is my watch .
yep .
when do i get it back ?
when you forget that i have it .
mix this up a little bit ...
sorry ...
what ?
your mother used to do that .
really ?
yep .
that' s how we met .
i was a waiter ... at the beach club .
whenever i' d pass with a tray , she' s steal the garnish .
what else did she do ?
what do you mean ?
i don' t know .
little things .
she' d eat her ice cream with a fork .
really ?
really .
yeah .
she wrote great letters ...
but she couldn' t spell .
she was a mcgovern democrat but incredibly snobbish .
she hummed all the time .
and stephen stills was her favorite singer .
who ?
never mind .
what else ?
considering the time ... she was actually ... pretty straight .
i think she only tried drugs once .
there was a lifeguard who gave her a hash brownie .
she threw it up all over him .
she laughed just like that .
words and poetry is what she loved .
she was a " unique " .
okay , you guys .
how about a toast ?
welcome to charlotte .
welcome .
cheers !
thanks , you guys .
you know , call me crazy ... but i could swear your friends like me more ... than they like you .
that' s altogether possible .
my friends definitely like me more .
what' s your point ?
that i m way out front in the love race .
love ?
love is not a race .
our love is .
our love ?
yes , we' re going for it , aren' t we ?
why not ?
alright , i have to tell you something .
what ?
i never had a date for the benefit .
really ?
yeah .
i was kind of wondering about that .
i made that hat for myself ?
yes .
you bought that dress for me ?
yeah .
you did all that so you could get a hold of me and muss me up ?
yes .
first of all , you have great taste because that dress was amazing .
thank you .
and second , you didn' t have to lie .
if you wanted to seduce me , all you had to do was ask .
that' s not seducing , that is asking .
besides i don' t know why but women seem to love it when you lie to them .
there isn' t a lie in the world i' d rather hear than the truth .
there she goes again , stepping out on me and breaking my heart .
even he likes me more .
you' re fired .
come on , it' s just ...
no !
ouch !
ouch !
i can' t believe this !
breathe , breathe .
breathe ... are you alright ?
that' s not accurate .
neuroblastoma is a soft tissue malignancy , but not a cancer .
most common in children .
very rare in young adults .
in charlotte' s case ... the tumor is in her chest cavity .
it s growing rapidly , it' s proved resistant to both the radiation ... and the chemotherapy .
what about alternative therapies ?
eastern medicine ... ?
you don' t hum this away .
charlotte is the expert in that area .
eventually , she' il be treated for pain .
i suppose , as a final effort ... surgery could become on option .
but it' s risky .
so risky that charlotte has ... signed a directive forbidding it , or any other form ... of heroic intervention .
all right .
do you have any idea ... about time ?
a year .
maybe a year , at best .
real charmer , isn' t she ?
how are you on cambodian money units ?
are you okay there ?
yes , thank you .
that' s incredible .
doesn' t it look exactly like something she would have worn ?
who ?
hope is a thing with feathers that perches in the soul .
woody allen ?
emily dickinson !
only the greatest poet ever !
uncultured swine .
we all have our areas .
i m a food guy .
why don' t you ask me about food .
why are you the food guy ?
what is it about the food ?
food ... food is the only ... beautiful thing that truly nourishes .
is that a quote ?
that' s me .
excuse me ?
excuse me ?
yes .
the woman who just passed by here and went in the door ... ?
yes ?
it' s not lisa , is it ?
yes .
lisa tyler ?
yes .
could you ... ?
no .
thanks .
hello .
come in .
oh , you look so great .
where are the girls ?
they' re upstairs .
i m going to run up and say hi .
you' re a dog .
oh , man !
there' s stuff ... in the kitchen .
you want to give the candy to the trick or treaters ... when they come ?
one , two , three , go !
go !
ricky , don' t laugh , or you' re going to get snot in the water .
snot ?
where is this snot in the water ?
can i get you a bone or something ?
don' t bite anything that' s not an apple .
guess who ?
it' s wonder woman .
no .
get your hands out of there .
i got it !
we got the champ !
let me give you a hint .
i was the best thing that ever happened to you .
it couldn' t be lynn mchale .
god !
you are really bad !
lynn !
i can' t believe it !
where are the kids ?
upstairs in their room .
keep bobbing for apples in there .
just one more .
please ... ?
but then you' re going to have to promise you' re going to get in your jammies .
yes .
you promise ?
which one ?
i know , " butterflies " .
two butterflies ... went out at noon ...
and waltzed above a stream ...
then stepped straight through the firmament ... and rested on a beam .
and then together bore away ... upon a shining ... sea .
though never yet , in any port ... their coming mentioned me ...
in my day , you bobbed for the apple ... may there' s a nickel in it but ... you eat the apple !
your little animals , grab the coin and run for the door .
they' re off to by crack .
definitely .
where' s my little puppy dog ?
i think he' s upstairs .
there you are .
hi .
we were just up on the roof checking out ...
the kids are sleeping .
john' s got this amazing set up there .
lynn , i want you to meet charlotte .
nice to meet you .
nice to meet you .
something tells me you' re upset with me .
what is it ?
i was just wondering if ... if you had sex with that woman ?
with lynn ?
ever ?
the answer to that is kind of obvious .
she' s an old girlfriend .
you knew that .
i meant ... tonight .
on the roof .
you' re not serious ?
you are serious . no !
no , of course not .
first off , it' s ... it' s not exactly my style .
second ...
you have a girlfriend .
isn' t that for me to say ?
as far as lynn goes , why would i do that ?
it doesn' t make any sense .
i know .
i mean , that' s what i was thinking ... we' re ... so happy ...
what would be his reason ?
i thought , god , if he did do it , then you' d at least look ... guilty .
and you don' t .
you look totally relaxed .
you look more relaxed ... than before the party started .
well ... there you go .
but , you' re a womanizer .
you were a womanizer .
what is that exactly ?
here we go .
that' s a guy who has sex with a lot of women and is good at lying about it .
yes .
but in this case i don' t have anything to lie about .
nothing happened !
there' s something about being sick ... in my heart .
it s like i can feel every beat .
i il know if you' re lying .
oh , god !
oh , my god !
can you pull over , please ?
don' t do this .
charlotte !
charlotte !
why ?
look , i never pretended to be ... what i m not .
why ? !
why ? !
all right , fine , why ?
why ?
because i felt like it .
because nothing stopped me !
what about love ?
why do you have to be so juvenile ? !
it was nothing .
it was nothing !
it meant nothing !
if i could be different ...
i would .
what about love ?
you know what ?
this was all wrong .
this was a mistake , right from the beginning .
you' re a kid ...
i m a creep .
you' ve got better things to do with your last ... with your time ... than spend it with a man like me .
look who' s here .
the belle of amherst .
i' ve seen that face before .
you have ?
on several occasions .
all for the same reason .
you said mom and will were just friends .
they were friends .
but she was just nuts about him .
she never slept with him .
maybe because she was an old fashioned girl .
but she was smart .
until she made the big mistake .
she told him how she really felt .
it was up in newport at the club .
labor day weekend .
big clam bake .
well , what happened ?
next thing you knew , he was knocking up millie what' s her name in a cabana .
millie ?
your mother' s doubles partner .
why didn' t you tell me any of this ?
you know , you could have warned me .
i could have .
but i didn' t .
you never talk to me .
you never tell me what to do .
charlotte , take a good look at me .
you want me to tell you what to do ?
yes !
you' re my family !
you' re my family .
you' re supposed to take care of me .
where you been ?
home .
i called you ten times .
i had the ringer off .
i don' t get it .
what' s to get ?
i was hanging out .
something happen at my party ?
you were there .
we had a good time .
come on !
what' s going on ?
nothing !
what is it , something with charlotte ?
we called it quits .
you' re shittin ' me !
it s not exactly we called it quits , it was a more of , she called it quits .
what did you do ?
what do you mean ... ?
what did you do ?
what did i ... ?
don' t bullshit me .
what did you do ?
i had sex with lynn mchale up on your roof .
you' re kidding me .
no , i m not kidding you .
now she' s gone .
totally .
i m really sorry you did that .
i blew it .
can you get her back ?
i blew it .
so ?
so , i just go back to the way i was .
and how are you going to do that ?
it was just going to get worse .
the more attachment on both sides , leading to what ?
it s now or later , right ?
i leave her a few months from now , she ...
no , this is better .
this is much better .
i wish the fuck i' d never met her .
i hate to tell you , but there' s only two kinds of love stories .

mr. keane .
good night , michael .
you' ve got a visitor .
she' s been waiting almost an hour .
lisa !
sorry to disappoint you .
no ... you surprised me , that' s all .
did you get my letter ?
what did you do with it , burn it ?
i read it .
do you want to come upstairs ?
no , thank you .
i m sorry .
i didn' t plan this .
i didn' t plan to come .
peter , my husband thought it was pointless .
but , as it turns out , i m pregnant ... just a few months .
lisa !
congratulations !
that' s great .
thank you .
anyway , that made me want to meet you .
i' ve been a little sentimental about parenthood lately .
do you consider me your parent ?
in a lousy absentee sort of way , yeah .
so , how ... how is millie ?
your mother ?
she' s great .
she' s good .
well , she' s a nut .
she went to costa rica last summer with some guy .
he owns a charter airline and wears sunglasses indoors .
i think he' s a gun runner , but ...
do you really care ?
no .
no .
i guess not .
what about you ?
how long have you lived in the city ?
just a few months .
we moved from austin .
if you hadn' t been on that magazine ...
i might not have recognized you .
i only have one photograph and it' s ancient .
i have one picture of you , too .
just one .
your mother sent me one ... a long time ago .
you must have been about twelve .
you had a horse .
summer camp .
my teeth are bigger than the horse' s .
i hated that picture .
i hate it .
i don' t .
you were very beautiful .
and you haven' t changed a bit .
i should go .
why ?
i really just wanted to meet you .
and maybe ...
i don' t know .
what ?
tell me .
it s not big deal .
i' ve always had a fantasy that you were looking for me .
and all you really wanted was to say that you were sorry .
lisa , i am .
hey , can i ...
can i call you ?
how did you get in here ?
dolly .
would you mind leaving now , please ?
i need to talk to you .
i think you' ve wasted enough of my time .
what i did was ... very wrong .
and stupid .
i have no excuses ...
i did what i did because ...
i was scared .
you were a coward !
can you forgive me ?
you betrayed me !
for what ?
because you got the shakes ?
i was scared .
you don' t think i m scared ? !
you don' t think i m hanging onto my courage by my fingernails !
don' t touch me !
get away from me !
get out of here !
just go !
you' re not good enough .
i know ...
i know i m not .
i just ...
can you let me love you ?
please .
please .
please ...
please let me try again .
i m so tired .
the stars are as soft as flowers and as near .
the hills are webs of shadow ... " " ... slowly spun .
no separate leaf or single blade .
all blend to one .
i love you .
we did it ... that was great .
bye !
bye !
are you jealous ?
you think ... ?
i am not jealous !

charlotte !
doctor !
mr. keane ...
tell me .
the repeat mri and cat scan show interval progression .
the tumor' s grown .
yes .
considerably .
it s begun to obstruct the outflow from her heart .
i m sorry , i wish there was ...
there' s very little we can do .
we may be talking about weeks .
weeks ?
i m sorry .
you said she had a year !
no , i said a year at best .
that' s not good enough !
you said a year !
i want to have a year !
this is inappropriate .
alright , sorry , sorry .
you said there would be a point when surgery ...
might be an option .
lf charlotte agrees to it .
let' s assume that she did .
when would this operation take place ?
when it' s clear we' re losing her .
would you perform it ?
i am not a surgeon .
the point is not finding someone who' s qualified .
it s finding someone who' s qualified who is willing to do the operation .
hey !
hey .
how are you ?
you okay ?
yes .
how do you feel ?
stoned .
you' re killing my hand .
charlotte , there' s something i would like to talk to you about .
don' t .
heavy .
no heavy .
sibley and i have been talking ... about surgery .
about the paper you signed .
no violins .
come on .
i m fine .
woody , you' re the head of surgery ... if you can' t help me , who can ?
are you trying to tell me that in all of mt .
sinai , there is not one single ...
yeah , sibley told me that .
the 30th .
yeah , fine ... blank .
ok , when will the doctor be out of surgery ?
this is urgent .
i have a friend who says she' s one of the few doc ...
i m sorry .
thank you .
please , i don' t ... speak german .
please , i' d like to speak to a doctor .
where' s the doctor ?
he can' t be in surgery for a week and a half .
no !
you do not hang up ! ...
she doesn' t have long .
weeks .
maybe less .
and they can' t do anything for her ?
no , her doctor says when it' s hopeless at the end ... ... surgery could be an option .
heroic surgery , she calls it .
that' s why i m out looking for someone to make sure that when the times ... comes , it' s a hero that performs it .
i haven' t found anybody yet though .
i can' t find anybody who' s even willing to attempt it .
i will !
i m going to find someone because i can' t lose her .
it won' t happen .
she' s too young .
i m sorry .
i m here , but i have no right to be here .
there' s no excuse for what i did to you , lisa .
you' re my child .
you needed me .
i m so sorry .
i want to help you ... find a surgeon .
i m a researcher .
i can find anyone .
even you .
what do you want for christmas ?
you can be really selfish about this ... anything you want .
or we can go somewhere ... anywhere .
i il take you to bali ...
timbuktu ...
buffalo .
don' t you have a restaurant to run ?
what' s more important , is what do you want for christmas ?
no , you already gave me my present .
i forgot .
did you like it ?
what was it again ?
misery , heartbreak , pain ... ... happiness , love ...
life .
i remember now .
what can i give you ?
more of this .
yeah ?
i' ve got him .
oh lisa , hold on , hold on .
yeah , go ahead .
his name is tom grandy .
harvard undergrad .
he' s at the cleveland heart institute .
ohio ? !
it' s one of the best in the world .
he did his residency at brigham , cardiac surgery training at cleveland .
he takes the cases no one else will touch .
they say he' s a miracle worker .
he spends a lot of time traveling , a lot of time lecturing .
i got you an appointment today at 12 : 30 .
do not be late .
he only has 15 minutes .
the surgeon that recommended him said if you can get him to take the case ... ... you know charlotte' s got a chance .
he hates the fail .
mr. keane ?
yeah , hi .
thanks for a seeing me .
i' ve got everything that you asked for .
just once i' d like to get sent something simple .
that never happens anymore .
the downside of being good at my job .
good ?
my daughter was told you were the best .
like most people , i do the best can .
last time she passed out she regained consciousness almost immediately .
next time , or the time after , she won' t .
when that happens , call me .

i il coordinate with sibley .
i can' t thank you enough .

an opportunity .
do you mean sexual or professional ?
sexual .
i mean , professional !

i m way too claustrophobic .

you' re going away for the holidays ?
i doubt it .
did mr. keane enjoy his trip ?
what trip ?

i wouldn' t call that a trip .
i' ve never been to ohio .
it s amazing how little i' ve seen of this country .
cool ...
i m gonna get me some hot chocolate ...
is it straight ?
not straight .
what were you doing in ohio ?
i had a meeting with heart specialist .
he' s willing to operate .
that' s exactly what i didn' t want you to do .
you went behind my back .
you lied to me .
this what we talked about ...
cut it out !
stop !
no , we talked about that !
you do not want to die !
you want to live !
you think i haven' t been through this ?
so many times !
i don' t want to give people hope when there isn' t any .
why not ?
maybe , we need hope .
maybe , i need to know that i' ve done everything that i could do .
lf i m gonna ...
what would i do , will if you weren' t here ?
where would i be ?
seriously ?
you' il never have to worry about that .
i il do whatever i have to do .

time cannot break ... the bird' s wing from the bird .
the bird and wing together ... go down , one feather .
no thing that ever flew ... " " ... not the lark , not you ...
