hey , baby .
how was your shift ?
hi , baby .
it was great .
been drinking ?
yes , i had a few drinks with the boys .
what' s the matter ?
i saw you on the news , jack .
linda , what is wrong ?
i saw you on the news , jack .
dangling from a rope !
how could you tell me that it' s not dangerous ?
i didn' t say it wasn' t dangerous .
when we talked about it ...
i asked you , and you said it wasn' t dangerous .
i said it wasn' t any more dangerous than being on the engine .
i never said it wasn' t dangerous .
do you see me right now ?
do you ?
' cause this isn' t just about us .
have you thought about that ?
don' t .
don' t .
i' m sorry .
i' m scared .
i can' t sleep .
i keep having that dream ... ... about the red car turning up in front of the house when you don' t come home .
i' m sorry .
don' t .
i saved that man today .
did i miss it ?
they just took her to the delivery room .
is she ok ?
she' s fine .
aah !
aah !
hey , chief .
yeah , jack , go ahead .
chief , it' s getting pretty unstable in here .
i got all sorts of shit falling down around me .
i understand .
now , jack , listen up .
ok .
can you identify anything around you ?
there' s a sliding access door to my left .
but i can' t get to it .
there' s too much debris .
chief , the problem is every floor eight through eleven are identical .
well , look , if the collapse happened here , and he' s anywhere near this control room ... ... if we can get him in here , it could buy us some time .
my best guess is that he' s right about here in this area .
and if he can break through this wall and get into the control room ...
right , right .
and if my guys can get through the debris ... ... they can meet here , and go down the back stairwell .
might work , chief .
ok , now , look , jack , this is very important .
right behind you there' s a wall .
behind that wall is a control room .
ok ?
if we can break through that wall , we can buy some time .
can you do that ?
i' il give it a shot .
where do you need us , chief ?
i need two men up there on eight , helping ladder 17 .
and i need a two and a half inch supply line right now up on eight .
go .
copy that , chief .
ladder 49 , i need a situation report .
the progress is that we' re working on it , chief .
i need another blade !
sir , there' s no way to tell .
it' s tough .
all hands are working .
just keep at it .
copy .
go .
just give me another saw .
we need a saw !
get me a saw !
gotta make a wish first .
i wish for a barbie car .
no , you' re not supposed to say it out loud .
but won' t i get it now ?

we were divorced nine months later .
but you' re different .
you' re a good father .
you worry .
but you should worry .
you know , maybe it' s time for a change of scenery .
yeah , what does that mean ?
well ...
i was thinking ... ... there' s this , uh , job down at headquarters .
there' s this aide' s position that i can put your name in for .
are you saying i need to get out of the firehouse ?
well , i' m saying that you should ask yourself that question .
maybe go home , talk to linda .
you know , be honest with yourself .
there' s nothing wrong with moving on .
i did it .
so , what did he say ?
mike offered to take me with him as an aide .
what does that mean for us ?
well , i' il be home nights , unless they call me in .
and , uh , 70 cents an hour increase in pay .
no fighting fire .
is that what you want ?
i don' t know .
um ...
you know ?
things have been ... so crazy lately and ...
you know , the kids are scared , and i see you upset ... ... and , uh , you know , it' s my fault .
so this is about me and the kids again , is it ?
look , we' ve been married ten years .
and what you do is hard for me sometimes .
and i do get scared .
but i deal with it .
' cause i' m proud of you , baby .
you know , mike asked me tonight ... ... if i still love the job the way i did .
and , for the first time in my life , i didn' t know what to say .
... from midnight through the current hour ... ... how this has been progressing on into our area .

ladder 49 to command .
we' re through the debris .
and conditions deteriorating rapidly !
ladder 49 , there' s a control room straight ahead .
jack' s in there .

i will .
command to all units .
evacuate the building immediately .
truck 16 checking in here , chief .
uh , all units reporting clear .
the building' s clear .
we' re all out .
copy that .
it' s never an easy thing ... ... saying goodbye to a brother firefighter .
it' s not .
and this time particularly is difficult for me ... ... because i watched jack grow into a ... ... well , into one of the finest firefighters i' ve ever known .
he joined this department because he wanted to help people .
who knows how many homes are still standing because jack was there ... ... or how many lives were spared ?
he gave his life for that cause .
we' il never forget you , jack .
and we' re better for having known you .
tomorrow , when that bell rings ... ... we will be back on the truck ... ... because you were the bravest of the brave .
people are always asking me ... ... how is it that firefighters run into a burning building ... ... when everyone else is running out ?
well , jack , you answered that question ... ... by saving another man' s life .
your courage is the answer .
and today we will be as brave as you ... ... by not mourning you , but by celebrating your life .
so i' d like everyone to stand up and celebrate the life ... ... of jack morrison .
thank you .
