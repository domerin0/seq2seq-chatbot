foryour people , itwas just that a theory .
for mine , itwas a practice .

the great debate in mytime ... was the possibilitythat life existed on other planets .
hmm .
nowyou know .
how many ?
an infinite number .
but to end up on this planet with your particular life forms ... in this strange dimension beyond life itself that i had not planned on .
well , i guess we' re in the same boat , aren' twe ?

though i guess the true nero has to be somewhere on this planet .
everyone comes here eventually , so it' spossible ,

oh , you' re not on earth anymore .
come on .
welcome to the go forbroke ,
for my sins , i am the captain .
it must have taken years to build a vessel ofthis six anda half , to be exact , ifyouplease ,
i modeled her on the steamers i used to pilot up and down the mississippi .
add a couple ofsails forthe scaredy ancients among us to make them feel comfortable .
those ofus from the civilized democracies , we are in the minority here in this world .
the average riverworlder wouldkillyouas soon as look atyou ,
but on this vessel, you' re gonna find some rules and freedoms that don' t exist on the land ,
and with those liberties , we are gonna travel everywhere and anywhere this riverwill take us .
areyou going downriver ?
you got a reason we should go upriver ?
yeah .
nobody ever learned anything sailing awayfrom the source .
howaboutseeingthe engine room ?
everything you need to see you can see from up here .
we usedthe best materials andmen ,
and we got fellas here who worked on st , paul' s cathedral , the pyramids , the titanic , which they tell me was quite an engineering feat , despite its later mishap .
i' m sure any question you have will be answered soon enough .
in the meantime , there' s plenty ofjobs around here foryou to earn your keep .
these areyourshadows ,
doesn' t look like we have much ofa choice .
it' s nothing personal .
just can' t afford a security risk this close to launching her .
sam , a word , excuse me .
well , what is it ?
i found enough palladium to start thewheels and keep them turning .
where ?
a decoration on valdemar' s throne .
it' s pretty rare , monat .
any cetian can smell saturated metal hydride a mile away .
ourtechnology is based on it .
timing' s good , with valdemargone , it' ilbeprettyconfusedaround there , i' m sure i can get it ,
valdemarwe knew .
nero we don' t .
what if one of us gets caught ?
no .
can' t risk it .
sam , the whole rock gives us enough critical mass to finally launch this boat .
i saywaiting is the risk .
this is not a democracy , tane .
i decidewho goes , who stays , when we launch and when we don' t .
and what i' m tellingyou both is
i' il think about it .
howyou everconvincedme to develop this cockamamie technology ofyours , i' il neverknow ,
what' s the matterwith a wood burning furnace anyway ?
myboat powered byrocks ,
pull it close .
gwen , look .
i could makeyou a pretty dress .
me ?
look , i' ve almost forgotten what it' s like to wear civilized clothes .
how about i teach you to sew as well ?
i' m just gonna take a bath .
what , you wanna comewatch me ?
whoo !
what doyou mind ?
no , i don' t .
in mytime , when a bunch ofus wouldget togetherin a hot tub , we' dcallit aparty ,
but i guess you didn' t do that kind ofstuffin your time .
not if one had manners .
i wonderwhat my children would thinkofme now ?
did you have a family ?
i had a son .
he died ofleukemia .
and his ... mother , well , she tried
she tried , butshe couldn' t standthepain , she took herown life ,
i' m so sorry .
so who' s gonna get out first ?
not me .
howmuch ofit is mine ?
as far as the eye can see .
to expandfurther , we need the ship the rebels are building ,
ourspies tell us it' s nearlyreadyto launch ,
then we should act soon .
we mine enough ore from the rocks that fall from the sky to keep our men fullyarmed ,
the rebels steal from the harvest fields occasionally , but it never amounts to much ,
valdemar couldn' t catch them ?
they are highly skilled .
sometimes it is better to allow them some freedom .
their ingenuity can be useful .

besides , we' re goin ' downriver .
that doesn' t seem to interestyou .
sam , listen to me .
in all youryears here , haveyou ever seen a native ofthis world ?
not in 1 0 years .
there' s stories , but that' s all they are .
they' re not stories .
someone came to me while i was still under the water ... and he gave me the power to see the future .
i saw nero .
i saw a dark tower wrapped in ice and snow ... and i saw this exact boat headed upriver and i was on it .
well , i reckon ifthat' s ourfuture , then it' il happen just theway you saw it .
you don' t believe me .
i don' t believe anyone , and i don' t believe in anyone except myself .
then believe in what your eyes are telling you .
believe in that .

but meteors contain otheruseful metals , hale ,
the rarest is hydratedpalladium , which we intend to use as a fuel for ourboiler ,

i lacked thejudgment ofthe elder emperors .
but i' ve learned from my mistakes .
and now i know i need a strong empress by my side ... to steady me , to teach me ... compassion , an emotion i was never allowed to develop in rome .

what about the sails ?
it' s keeping us from drifting , but that' s about it .
we' re doing all we can .

what an artist the world loses in me .
famous last words , right ?
you' ve studied me .
how gratifying .
yeah , i' ve studied you .
i' ve studied nero the emperor , nero the coward .
according to history , you poisoned yourwayto the top , and then , underyourfine leadership , thewhole empire fell .
well , history is mistaken .
you were thesadend to theaugustan dynasty andthe endofrome ,
no !
no !
i tried to resurrect a crumbling republic .
myown mother , mywife octavia they all plotted against me ... and against rome .
i died fighting against false accusations .
you died on the run , and then you killed yourself becauseyou were afraid to faceyour enemies .
that wasyourlegacy ,
bevery , very careful .
give him yourweapon .
i said ...
come on ! give him yourweapon .
move !
i' il die fighting false accusations again , ifthat' s what the gods demand ofme .
so neptunewill have my sacrifice .
the first person you have ever killed .
yeah .
yeah , up close .
hewon' t be the last .
not byfar .
nero' s dead .
dropyourweapons .

i guess so .
yes !
goodwork !
you were right .
itwas one hell ofa launch party .
come on in .
well , here' s to life on the river .
well , they all wantyou to be  sam , i did what i had to do to get us out ofthere .
this isn' t my boat .
i didn' t build her .
i' m not asking you to buy her , hale .
truth is , all i reallywant is to be the pilot ofthe go forbroke ,
mess about on the river .
i don' t know , maybe maybe find myself a little adventure .
mess about on the river , huh ?
kind oflike tom sawyer ?
uh huh .
i don' t know ifaunt polly would approve ofthat .
but ibet mark twain would ,
orsam clemens , as he was known to his friends back in the days when he was ,,, piloting that steamboat up and down ole' miss ,
mark twain .
i haven' t heard that name in years .
born under a comet , died under a comet , partial to meteors ,
come on , sam .
why don' tyou tell them the truth ?
whydon' tyou tell them whoyou reallyare ?
doyou miss your family , hale ?
i do .
but they know someone named marktwain .
when i look back on my earthly life , i realized that i was the most happiest ... when i was plain old sam the boat pilot .
maybe iknewwho i was andwho i wasn' t ,
now i figure that' s why i' m here , to find out ... why that was so .
i' d sure appreciate it ifyou let it stay that way ...

let' s head upriver .
theirjourney has begun .
as you said itwould .
butwill it be completed in time ?
