you have to be very careful not to bend the card ,

otherwise i don' t get paid for it ,
no ,
that' s fair , because ... the people in the shops would never want to buy it if it' s bent ,
you wouldn' t buy it if it was bent ,
that' s true , i wouldn' t ,
wouldn' t buy anything if it was bent ,
in czechoslovakia ,
i saw a film , and they were eating candy from a tin just like this ,

i have no money ,
all the money that i inherited is ...
it' s gone ,
and linda ...
linda ...
she spends and spends ,
and my salary' s nowhere near enough ,
i can' t say no to her ,
the bank' s gonna repossess the house ... because i' m so far behind on the payments ,
and i' m gonna lose linda ,
i know it ,
i know i am ,
she loves you , bill ,
oh , don' t cry ,
i shouldn' t have told you ,
don' t worry ,
shouldn' t have told you , it' s okay ,
don' t worry ,
no , i think you' ve got enough ... stuff ,
would it make you feel better if i told you a secret ?
what secret could you tell me ?
i' m going blind ,
not yet , but ...
soon ,
maybe sometime this year ,
blind ...
it' s not as bad as it sounds ,
it' s , uh ...
it' s a family thing ,
but , blind ?
i' ve always known it ,
from ... when i was a little girl ,
i knew ,
and you' re okay ?
well , i came to america because in america , they can give gene an operation ,
you know ?
gene ?
he doesn' t know about it ,
you ... you mustn' t tell him , because then it could get worse ,
i just have to save up money , you know , enough money to ...
oh , i almost got it ,
to , uh ...
for the operation ,
they can operate on gene when he turns 1 3 ,
and you made up that story about your father ?
huh ,
i never had a father ,
i made up his name , too ,
and that' s why you put in all these hours and do all these pins and do everything you do ,
for him ,
for his operation ,
well , it is my fault ,
i guess ...
how is it your fault ?
because i ...
i knew he would ... he would have bad eyes like me ,
but i had him ... all the same ,
you' re very strong ,
i' m not strong ,
i' ve got little games i play when it goes really hard ,
when i' m working in the factory ... and the machines , they make these ... rhythms ...
and i just start dreaming , and it all becomes music ,
but you like movies , don' t you ?
i love the movies , yeah ?
i just love the musicals ,
oh , when they' re all tap dancing ?
all of them tap dancing , all of them , this huge , long line ,
i ... wouldn' t you like to be in that big , long line ?
yeah ,
kicking your feet up there ?
yeah ,
when they' re , like , spiraling up the huge , enormous wedding cakes to the top ?
yeah ,
but isn' t that annoying when they do the last song in the films , though ?
why ?
because you just know when it goes really big , and the camera goes , like , out of the roof , and you just know it' s gonna end ,
i hate that ,
i really hate that ,
i used to cheat on that when i was a little girl back in czechoslovakia ,
i would leave the cinema just after the next to last song , and the film would just go on forever ,
it' s lovely , isn' t it ?
that is lovely ,
selma ...
yeah ?
thank you for telling me your secret ,
thanks for telling me yours ,
mum' s the word , right ?
mum " ?

czechoslovakia' s so much better than the u, s , of a ?
no , selma , no !
there are two plates ,

you shouldn' t be working at the press at all ,
i mean , how dare you !
just how much can you see ?
i could do my job with my eyes closed ,
so could you ,
no ,
it' s just because i was daydreaming ,
daydreaming ?
dreaming about what ?
oh , i just hear music ,
come on , i mean , selma , music ?
you could also cut off your hand just like that , you have to watch out every second ,
promise me you' il stay awake ,
i i promise i will stop daydreaming ,

i don' t know why i bother that much ,

i' m sorry , bill ,
that' s all right , i shouldn' t have asked ,
oh , you had to , don' t worry , there' s no harm in asking ,
no , no , i shouldn' t have asked ,
linda wants new couches ,
i could always shoot myself ,
you mustn' t say things like that ,
it' s make things easier ,
you know that , bill , aw , selma ,
you mustn' t say things like that ,
selma , i' m kidding ,
hi , selma , come on in ,

yeah , go on , sure ,
he' s got a gun ?

he' s a police officer ,
i just didn' t know he would keep it here , in the house ,
oh , yeah , yeah , yeah ,
he keeps it in his desk ,
maybe i should pay more rent ,
it' s been the same for the whole period i' ve been here ,
no , selma , i won' t hear it ,
you keep your money , you need it more than we do ,
two boxes ?
did you decide you are going to do two boxes at the same time now ?
yeah ,
selma ... 1 0 : 00 then ?
1 0 : 00 ,
what happens at 1 0 : 00 ?
i' m i' m gonna do the night shift ,
the night shift ?
you can hardly see well enough to do your own shift ,
it suits me fine ,
it' s just after drama class ,
you are going to do that , too ?
i' ve had my fill of you , selma ,
you do what you want ,
go ahead , break your neck ,
do your night shift , but don' t think for one second
i' m going to come and rescue you ,
selma ?
kathy split already ,
i' m not looking for kathy ,
i was looking for you ,
i just have to go to drama rehearsal ,
so what do you say ?
you can always ride your bike ,
you have it over there ,
i left it at home ,
i thought it' d be quicker if i walked ,
how do you reckon that ?
i just walk along the railroad tracks ,
it' s a ... shortcut ,
look , i don' t understand , in musicals ... why do they start to sing and dance all of a sudden ?
i mean , i don' t suddenly start ... to sing and dance ,
no ...
you' re right , jeff , you don' t ,
the last thing on the list is the bake sale ,
two sundays away ,
hi , selma , come on in , come on in ,
i' m gonna introduce you to your understudy ,
my understudy ?
yeah ,
this girl suzan , who boris knows , is a good singer , she' s a good dancer ,
she' il learn your part , too , because , say , you get a cold , and ... you can' t do it , then the show doesn' t have to stop ,
okay ?
suzan , selma , selma , suzan ,
could you take off your glasses ?
i think we' il do the part without glasses ,
next sunday , you will see both marias ,
i mean , selma will do the role , really , but ... i' il have you read part of it too ,
all right ?
it' s your first time on the night shift , right ?
while this is being pressed , you' il be cutting on the other machine ,
that means you' il be in charge of two machines ,
you have to beat sarah over there , right ?
this pallet must never be empty ,
is it always so dark in here ?
what ?
is it always so dark in here ?
it' s exactly the same as the daytime ,
oh , okay ,
the only thing is you have to work a little faster ,
that' s what you' re paid for , right ?
okay , okay ?
thank you ,
excuse me , yeah ?
you have to work a little , you know , a little faster than this ,
okay ,
what are you doing here ?
what do you think ?
i didn' t put you down for the night shift , kathy ,
run along , norman ,
i' m on my own time now ,
how i spend it is my own business ,
' night , ladies !
good night !
faster ,
a little faster ,
i like it better when you dance ,
you should dance more ...
cvalda ,

it' s music ,
now dance ,
selma !
stop that , you' ve cut yourself !
get away from the machine !
henry !
oh , jeff is here ,
hello , jeff ,
hi , kathy ,
do you live here ?
thought she might say yes to a ride when it' s this late ,
m maybe kathy ... wants a ride ,
no , it' s all right ,
what' s that , with your hand ?
she cut her ...
cut my finger ,
yeah , it' s going to be all right ,
the plates are sharp ,
goodnight ,
careful ,
i think i found a solution to our problem ,
that makes me really happy ,
it' s nothing special ...
but i' ve made up my mind , i' m gonna tell linda , and , uh ...
i mean , after all , she loves me , and ...
we' il just work it out together ,
that sounds like a really good idea , bill ,
i' m sorry , i' il let you get to bed ,
i guess i' m kinda tired ,
thanks , bill ,
good night , selma ,
good night , bill ,
bill ?
what' s happening now ?
here we go , selma , are you ready ?
and ...
you' re on ,
cut , cut , stop ,
stop , please ,
this is selma' s entrance , okay ?
yeah ?
okay , paul , please ,
how far do you think it is ?
i don' t know ,
and ...
kathy , what are you doing ?
this is maria' s entrance ,
yes , i' m sorry ,
my mistake ,
please , please !
i don' t have all night !
six steps ,
let' s take this a little more seriously ,
good !
okay , i' m thinking maybe , selma ...
you could take a little sort of circle around boris on this next part , unless you have something else you wanna suggest ,
i' m open ,
okay ?
samuel ,
yes ?
i need to talk to you ,
oh , selma , please , if it' s about the drummer ,
i have been looking everywhere for a drummer
it' s not about the drummer ,
um ... just a quick word ,
do you wanna go outside ?
yup ,
okay ,
i i' m not gonna play maria ,
what ?
my heart just isn' t in this ...
like , i shouldn' t be wasting my time on something ... that isn' t ... that important really ,
i' ve been watching suzan , and she' s ...
she' s great ,
she' s ...
she' s very
she' s a much better dancer than i am ,
terrific ,
suzan' s terrific , i' m not denying that , but you i thought you lived for musicals ,
so you' ve been pretending the whole time ?
yes ,
i' ve just been pretending ,
i don' t know what else i could do with you ,
i' ve got everything cast right now ,
yeah ,
the only part that' s left is the old nun who lets maria out of the convent gate ,
i don' t think you' d want that part ,
there' s no dancing in that ,
she' s quite serious then ?
she' s serious ,
it' s important for the part ,
okay , i' m not dancing really ,
no ,
i could put a little bit of dancing in there ,
you think so ?
it i didn' t have it in mind ,
you can have your tapping ,
she could be just a little ... humorous once in a while ... even though she' s a nun ,
you' il always be my perfect maria ,
where are all the hairpins today ?
i left them at home ,
and she won' t be playing maria ,
what do you reckon i' m gonna do if i can' t bawl you out for learning your lines on company time ?
one ... two ...
three !
what kind of a joke is that ?
well , she' s beating me ,
i need a word with you ,
we' re talking right now ,
all right ...
come on ,
please sit down ,
we were off for the whole day ,
everything stops when the machine breaks ,
you know that ,
i i can do my job just fine ... if i stick to the day shift ,
this won' t happen again ,
look , i daydream too much ,
i i decided to quit ,
and ...
and i guess , then l i forgot ,
i' ve been ordered to let you go , selma ,
you' re not gonna have to pay for the machine you broke ,
i got them to agree to that ,
uh , thanks , norman ,
this is your salary ,
and you know , um ...
maybe we can find you something away from the machines where your eyesight wouldn' t matter so much ,
yeah ...
not right away ,
that' s very kind of you ,
i better go ,
i' il be okay , i really will ,
thanks , norman ,
thank you , selma ,
thank you ,
what is she going to do now ?
did you ever think about that ?
don' t worry , kathy , really ,
i' m gonna be fine ,
has anybody seen jeff today ?
he' s usually here early , selma , but not this early ,
it' s a shame ,
selma !
selma ...
i could give you a lift if you want ,
i i will need a lift ...
later ,
i need to do something important at ... at 3 : 00 ,
well , you need to get your truck then , don' t you ?

i know it' s not quite what you told me , but ... but it' s all i could get together ,
well ,
what last name shall i put on the receipt ?
oh , i don' t need a receipt ,
i really don' t ,
i have to know the name of your son ,
when he comes in for his operation ,
novy ...
he will come , and he will say that his name is novy ,
and then you will know ... that he has been paid for ,
novy ?
like oldrich novy , the tap dancer ?
it is strange , isn' t it ?
but he never really made it over here , did he ?
i saw his films when i was a kid ,
he was in the first musical
i' ve ever saw ,
same here ,
selma ?
it' s tuesday night ,

i think maybe we could do your scene ,
let' s do the tapping scene ,
okay ?
we haven' t done it in weeks , and we really need to rehearse it , and while you' re here , we might as well take advantage of the time , please ?
okay , let' s do the tapping scene ,

imagi you' re going to do
selma' s part for her for right now , all right ?

yes ,
we haven' t done it for a while ,
remember that part we did where where you , uh ... you come to the convent gate to say goodbye to the to maria ?
i should leave , jeff ,
what ?
gene gene is probably worried now ,
i haven' t seen him all day ,
all right ,
i' m sorry , samuel , but ...
betty , come here for a second , please ,
the drummer that you wanted
remember , you asked me for a drummer ?
i found somebody , she' s fantastic ,
her name' s betty , she' s right here for the first time tonight ,
please meet her , selma , this is betty ,
hi , betty ,
you play the drums ?
yeah ,
tell her how long you' ve been studying ,
two years ,
she' s wonderful ,
you' ve got to stay and enjoy this ,
you' ve got to i have an idea ,
let' s do the finale ,
i just remembered , you hate finales ,
no finale !
i' ve a better idea ,
climb every mountain , " part one ,
the state will show that the defendant has not only perpetrated the most callous ... and well planned homicide in recent memory ... but is also a fundamentally selfish individual ... who cynically hides behind a handicap , devoid of sympathy for anybody but herself ,
this woman found trust and friendship when she sought refuge in our country , and the evidence will show that she has repaid such kindness with betrayal , robbery , and murder , inflicted upon the very people who opened their homes and hearts to her ,
ladies and gentlemen of the jury ...
the evidence will prove that she herself ... did not show that mercy she will ask of us ,
is this the bag here , detective ?
yes , the very same ,
houston' s blood was all over it ,
well , shortly before the homicide ,
i had a checkup on her vision , and i found that she was myopic ,
it' s nearsighted
nearsighted , but ...
she could see ,
yes ,
she said communism was ... better for human beings ,
she had nothing but contempt for our great country and its principles ?
apart from its musicals , she said the american one ... the american ones were better ,
so ... the defendant preferred hollywood to vladivostok ,
i suppose that' s an acknowledgement of sorts ,
she just asked many times about the money ,
she wanted to know where it was ?
that' s right ,
she asked you about the gun ?
she wanted to know where it was kept ?
that' s right .
bill was lying on the floor and ... he was wounded ,
and ...
he was pleading for his life ?
yes ,
i i beg you , i beg you ,
i beg you ,
you showed him no mercy , selma !
you shall have no mercy either !
would you state your name for the record , please ?
selma jezkova ,
and bill and linda houston ... were your friends , is that right ?
yeah ,
in fact , you lived in a trailer on their property ,
yeah ,
and didn' t they also take care of your young son when you were at work ?
yeah ,
they bought him a ... birthday present recently ,
is that right ?
yeah , they got him a bike ,
right ,
your sight was poor , you claim , contrary to the expert testimony we have received ,
but you saw well enough to inflict 34 wounds on bill houston ,
so why did you kill him , actually ?
if i may be so bold to ask ?
he asked me to ,
he did ?
how intriguing ,
a man with a fine career and some wealth , a happy marriage , why would this bill houston ask you to kill him ?
i promised not to say ,
well , that clears things up immensely ,
you promised you wouldn' t say ,
in that case , we' il just have to take your word for it when you say that the money you stole that bill houston' s savings also disappeared so mysteriously that same day ,
just , uh ...
just where did you get your money ?
well ...
i' d been saving up ,
well , i suppose you could call it that ,
what were these savings to be used for ?
you never bought your son so much as a single birthday present , as we' ve heard ,
yes ?
my my father ,
in czechoslovakia ,
your father ?
and what , pray tell ... is his name ?
my my father is ...
oldrich novy ,
so ...
we' re meant to believe ... that you killed bill houston by inflicting 34 wounds on him because ...
he asked you to ,
just as we' re meant to believe that you were blind when you did it ...
are meant to believe that it was your own savings that you stole from him ...
just as we' re meant to believe that you sent all you had to your father back home , a man by the name of oldrich novy ,
is that right ?
yes ,
thank you , miss jezkova ,
ladies and gentlemen of the jury , you' ve now heard from the defendant' s own lips ,
you must believe her , just as you must believe her when she claims her father' s name is oldrich novy ,
your honor ... at this time , the state calls to the witness stand ...
oldrich novy ,
please state your full name ,
the name is oldrich novy ,
and you used to live in czechoslovakia ?
that is right ,
i live now in california , as you know ,
that' s right , that' s where we found you ,
what exactly is your relationship with the defendant ?
i do not know her ,
you don' t know her ?
so ...
you have not received money from her ,
money that that ... she says was so dearly earned ?
no , i have not ,
perhaps you' re not her father then ?
no , i am not ,
well , if this relationship was made up by the defendant , then ... can you think of any way she might' ve come to know your name ?
i was once well known in czechoslovakia uh ... because of my profession ,
yes , mr , oldrich novy , what is your profession ?
maybe that can give us a clue to why , why this somewhat ... romantic , certainly communistic , woman who worships fred astaire but not his country , why she might' ve lied ... and misused your name ... to make us think all her money was spent on a poor father and not on her own vanity ,
what is it that you do ?
i was an actor , i made films ,
they were musicals .
say it again !
will the court please rise ?
the honorable judge a, d , mantle presiding .
have you reached a verdict ?
yes , your honor ,
will the defendant please rise ?
we , the jury , find the defendant
selma jezkova guilty of murder in the first degree and hereby sentence her to death ,
is this the verdict of this jury ?
you fully understand that it must be unanimous ?
we do , your honor .
selma jezkova ...
you are hereby sentenced to be taken from this place and confined in the state penitentiary until such time as you shall be executed by being hanged by the neck until you are dead .
this court is adjourned .
all rise !
i' ve just heard about the ...
supreme court decision ,
yeah , i ...
i just want to talk practical stuff ,
on gene' s birthday ... he will receive a letter ,
and it' s so important , kathy ... that he reads it really carefully ,
i need you to take care of that for me ... because i' m not gonna be there when he gets it ,
he should not be afraid , because there' s nothing to be afraid of , kathy ,
listen , gene wants to see you so badly ,
won' t you let him ?
please ?
there' s nothing for him to see ,
he' s got you now , kathy .
he has to call himself novy ,
that' s very important ,
all right , time' s up , selma ,
i know that sounds a bit foolish ,
novy ?
i' m sorry i didn' t tell you before about all this , i just didn' t dare to because they would ruin everything ,
but what why does he have to call himself novy ?
stop asking questions like that , cvalda ,
please ...
iet me tell gene hello ... from you to him ,
no ,
i know you love your son very much ,
i love him very much ,
got a boy of my own back home ,
you never told me that ,
good night , brenda ,
good night ,
say hi to your son from me ,
thank you , selma ,
can i help you ?
did you once have a patient called ...
jezkova ...
selma jezkova ?
well , if it wasn' t too long ago ,
i can check my records for you ,
jes ...
jez ...
jess ...
sorry , there' s no one here by that name ,
what about novy ?
i have good news for you ,
what' s that ?
we found a new lawyer ... and he' s going to get your case re opened ,
he says your lawyer was incompetent ,
what do you mean ?
well , the case is going to be re opened ,
you won' t get the death sentence ,
is that true ?
yes , new information has turned up ,
wh what information ?
well , we know the whole story , selma ,
why didn' t you tell us anything ?
you know , about ... about the money for gene' s operation ,
how did you find out ?
well , jeff talked to the doctor ,
does does gene know ?
i mean , have you told gene ?
no , no , i didn' t ,
but you' ve got a much better case now ,
that' s very important , kathy ,
his eyes might get worse from worrying , and then the operation won' t work ,
yes , but , selma ...
don' t you see that it would help you if they knew that you were trying to save your son from going blind ?
the lawyer , he' il come and see you in two weeks ' time ,
kathy , but , uh ...
you know they' re hanging me in one week ,
we know that , but he says you can apply for a stay ,
you know , most cases get one the first time ,
well , you can smile ,
selma ...
yeah ... it' s just too much for me ,
i thought i was strong ,
i just can' t take it , kathy ,
apply for a stay ,
what if they don' t phone ?
uh , well , you' il be transferred to the other ... cell block at some point tomorrow ,
that' s the cell block where they hang people ,
yeah , that' s where they ... spend the last day ,
and then they do their 1 07 steps ,
it' s from that room ... to the gallows , isn' t it ?
that' s what they say , selma , but ...
look at ...
you' re gonna get your stay ,
why don' t you try to think of something nice , all right ?
it' s just so quiet here ,
what' s that got to do with it , selma ?
you know , when i used to work in the factory ...
i used to dream that i was in a musical , because , in a musical , nothing dreadful ever happens ,
but it' s so quiet here ,
don' t the prisoners march or something ?
march ?
no ,
yeah ?
no , they don' t , they don' t ...
there' s not ...
there' s not much noise around here , selma ,
i know ,
but later they turn on the radio ,
no , no , no , there' s no ...
they don' t allow radio in the isolation block ,
but i' ve been listening to the ventilation ... shaft ,
i hear sometimes people singing there ,
iike ... hymns or ...
that' s not against the rules , to listen , is it ?
no ,
i wonder if ... if maybe you' re hearing the singing coming from the chapel ,
yeah ?
maybe you' il even get a sermon ,
selma ...
you got your stay ,
you got the stay ,
i' m so happy for you ,
i' m your new legal counsel ,
my name is luke , okay ?
oh , hi , luke ,
i' m , uh , quite sure ...
i can get your sentence commuted ,
ali need is a signature stating you want the case re opened ... and then i can get all the paperwork ready by tomorrow ,
yeah ,
there' s a lot of things your other lawyer didn' t do that i' m going to do ,
a lot of ground that wasn' t covered that i am going to cover ,
the fact that you were fighting for your boy is something we can really milk ,
i have some experience in cases like this , so ...
that' s what the attorney before said ,
uh ... yeah ,
you see , he was appointed by the court , and you don' t get the best legal counsel that way ,
y you were not appointed by the court ?
i' m not appointed by the court , no ,
you' re gonna have to pay me ,
but ... not to worry ,
yeah ?
that' s been taken care of ,
i made a deal with your ...
iady friend ?
deal ?
yeah , in regard to my fee ,
i' ve agreed to accept the amount that she said she could raise ,
how much ...
how much was it ?
well , i can tell you precisely , because i received an envelope ,
it' s , uh , two thousand dollars $2, 056, 1 0 ?
that' s it precisely ,
now ...
there' s something here ,
i' d like to just sort of go over our tactics ,
i have a couple of questions to ask you ,
if he doesn' t have the operation next month , it' s gonna be too late !
and he will never be able to see !
this is what it' s all about , so he can see his grandchildren !
well , let me tell you something ,
the only thing that' s important to me in my whole life , and you don' t understand , kathy !
listen to me !
it' s just plain stupidity !
listen to me !
waste that kind of money ... on a blind woman who' s gonna spend the rest of her life in jail !
but he needs his mother , you know , alive , no matter where !
you don' t understand !
he needs his eyes !
he needs his mother !
no !
yes !
alive !
no !
listen to reason for once !
selma ,
selma ,
i listen to my heart ,
i will go to the police , i will tell them that ... you stole the money from ... from bill ,
oh , yes , i will tell that ,
i will tell them that , that you stole it from bill , and you will never see the money again !
that will be gone for good ,
no operation !
nothing !
no mother !
nothing !
you can have your money back ,
i just want to make sure that you fully comprehend what this means , this decision ,
yeah ,
you fully realize what will happen ?
yeah ,
i already asked for no more stays ,
once this starts , there' s no stopping it ,
you understand me ?
yeah ,
i' m prepared ,
gene says thank you ,
thanks for what ?
oh , some comic books on his birthday ,
you can' t buy him ... presents and say it' s from me ,
you have to stop doing that , jeff ,
uh , maybe you can just ...
phone him ,
just say , you know ... something to him ,
no , that' s that' s not a good idea ,
he wants to be the one ... who' s allowed to be there when it happens ,
but l and then they told him he' s too young ,
who put that crazy idea into his head anyway ?
i don' t want him to be there ,
i' il be there if you would ,
and kathy ?
you know kathy , she' s ...
she' s still angry ,
if you think you can take it ...
i would love you to be there ,
don' t cry , jeff ,
jeff , don' t cry , it' s gonna be fine ,
jeff ,
why did you have him ?
you knew he would have the same disease as you ,
i just wanted to hold a little baby ...
just in my arms ,
i love you ,
it' s time , selma ,
okay ?
okay ,
your meal , jezkova ,
it' s time ,
