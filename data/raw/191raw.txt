you are a negro .
he is white .
is somebody trying to jack me off ?
no . we' re foster brothers .
i ran away from this orphanage ...
shut up !
today , you caused my money train to arrive 46 minutes late .
when my train is late , i take it as a personal sign of disrespect .
the revenue collection of the entire subway system is under my command .
my train .
my people .
my money .
no one dictates the movements of that train without my permission .
am i making myself clear ?
as a bell . sir .
your train .
shut up !
yes . sir .
now ... any questions ?
why did you send the train through when you knew we were in the tunnel ?
your situation last night didn' t affect me .
your men shot that kid to shit over a rope chain .
yeah , they shot him to shit ... and you can' t buy publicity like that .
that boy is a goddamn hero .
you fuck with my train and i' il kill you !
i don' t like you .
so don' t fuck with my train again .
if you do , we will tangle ass ... ... and you will lose .
you' re dismissed .
i hate bastards like that .
you can' t put a price on human life .
he' s worried about his schedule .
you know what i' d like to do ?
shoot him ?
no .
i' d like to take his train .
take the candy from the baby .
you say the word .
word .
i' m there .
let' s do it .
if i didn' t have this badge ...
we' re not nuns .
we' re not taking the train .
too late .
i sure miss the old neighbourhood .
you should come back more often .
are you coming in ?
no , i' ve got a date .
with a girl ... or a deck of cards ?
do you think i' m gambling again ?
yeah , i can see it in your eyes .
you' ve got a suspicious mind .
i know you .
have you got any cash ?
i' m buying your christmas present .
with my money ?
yeah , so don' t be stingy .
you never cease to amaze me .
don' t count it .
i trust you .
will you really buy me a present ?
i love you .

they don' t have a sense of humour .
i' m tired of this shit .
you' re the man .
okay , let' s make a deal .
here' s the 300 bucks .
the rest , you get in a few days .
i' il pay you , i swear to god .
okay , reel him in .
you guys are great .
i was kidding about the sense of humour thing .
i thought they were gonna drop me .
you said you' d stopped this shit .
i thought i couldn' t lose .
you say the same thing every time .
i' m tired of saving your ass .
i' d have got out of that shit .
if i hadn' t saved you , you' d be a chalk outline right now .
i have changed at a basic level .
i was up there .
51 stories .
dangling .
imminent death .
suddenly ... it was like buddha consciousness .
i' ve read about it .
god spoke to me .
she said , ' you have got to stop gambling .
i bet $10 you can' t do it .
make it $20 .
where' s your sense of humour ?
you' ve been drinking dog piss .
it' s good for you .
let' s see that drunk walk again .
say hello to grace santiago .
she' s gonna be working with us .
hi , guys .
nice to meet you .
how are you doing ?
welcome aboard .
she is smokin ' .
i think i' m in love .
all quiet by the d.
okay , we' ve got a christmas shopper .
a white male .
19 .
dressed all black .
he' s interested .
his girlfriend' s after him .
she' s dragging him away .
did you do much decoy ?
six months in the outer boroughs .
this transfer was definitely a lucky break .
they say you guys are the best .
modesty prevents me ...
no . it doesn' t .
we are the best .
his arm' s swinging .
he looks like he forgot how to take a whiz .
he got that from me .
where are you from ?
the bronx .
are you living by yourself ?
yeah .
keep watching the d.
we' ve got something going on .
what have we got here ?
look at those big hands .
let' s take him home .
i' m into it .
hey , honey , we' re gonna take you home .
you want to come home ?
you' re a fine looking man .
don' t fight us .
look at that face .
we' re gonna love you .
we' re gonna chew you up .
come with us .
shouldn' t we break it up ?
hey !
that' s my man .
get your hands off my man .
do you want to get hurt ?
we didn' t know he was your man .
get out of here !
i can' t trust you for one minute .
they were huge .
she' s beautiful .
wait right there .
what are you looking at ?
alone at last .
may i help you ?
we can help each other .
what do you want , sir ?
i want to ask you a question .
do you know what it' s like to smell your own flesh burning ?
hand out the cash . bitch . or i' il light you up .
i gave you the money .
i' m not in it for the money .
it' s the torch !
call the ems .
i' il take the street .
get down !
sick bastard !
police !
get off me .
it' s okay .
johnny , merry christmas .
what are you drinking ?
the usual .
jack .
straight up .
give me to of those and give me to beers .
this is a little hard so you should drink it with ... ... a beer .
obviously ... ... you' ve been there before .
that' s with me , johnny .
you took a pretty hard one today .
too bad he got away .
it was his lucky day .
that won' t happen twice .
the ems people say the clerk is going to be just fine .
that' s good to hear .
this job can be hazardous to your health if you take it too seriously .
i don' t know no other way .
me neither .
it takes a special kind of person to do this job .
someone with dedication .
perseverance .
stamina .
strength .
courage .
cojones .
complete and utter stupidity .
it' s a curse .
welcome to the team .
thanks .
how are my to favourite people ?
we were fine .
he' s a kidder .
i looked long and hard and i found you something for your first day .
the alcohol preserves it .
thanks .
he probably stole it from a girl scout .
grab us a couple of cervezas .
you don' t expect grace to pay , and i' m having a cash flow problem .
you mean you' re broke !
you ain' t got a dime to your name .
i love the flower .
great guy ... too bad he' s gay .
how are you doing ?
good . man .
how does it feel to be brothers with a white guy ?
i told you that story .
i heard a garbage can making noises .
you found him ?
did you feed him ?
you can' t get rid of them when you feed them .
stay black .
i ain' t got no choice .
the night is young .
i' ve got to go .
the night' s a puppy .
she' s leaving .
i' m in love .
you ain' t got a shot .
i am deeply in love .
she is nice .
i' d introduce her to ma di if she was still alive .
may the best man win .
i intend to .
you' re dreaming .
you ain' t even got a chance .
she didn' t even keep the rose you gave her .
that' s fucked up !
you can buy her a new one .
i wouldn' t do that to you .
it' s typical of your insensitivity , like pissing on that car .
you' ve always got to be the coolest .
you' ve always got to be on top .
i' m just kidding .
you' re always that way .
ma di gave you everything .
ma di treated us the same .
no .
she treated me great .
she took me in . she loved me . but she loved you better .
we got the same thing , charlie .
it' s called sharing .
i get your coat , you get my shoes .
i' m always in your shoes .
i' m always hook' s little brother .
is this about shoes or grace ?
my ceiling is always your floor .
then move out of the building .
i like the building .
but you' re always first and i' m always one step behind .
so now it' s my fault ?
yeah , partially .
it' s you who always fucks it up .
now you' re calling me a fuckup .
i didn' t say that .
it' s the same fucking thing .
are you listening to me ?
i don' t need this shit .
get your hands off me .
or what ?
i' m here , you' re there ...
make a move . man .
you want to try me ?
wallets , rings and watches .
give up your shit .
are you deaf ?
i' m talking to you .
you heard the man .
chill out , white boy .
now look at the shit we' re in .
are you gonna blame this on me ?
definitely .
who was watching the street ?
my back was to the street .
i' m sick of you .
stop pinning everything on me .
give it up !
you called me a fuckup .
i did not !
fuck you , man !
fuck me ?
fuck you !
i' m robbing your ass !
give up your shit !
i' il get you his shoes .
i' il shoot you .
this is a stick up !
i' il shoot you full of holes .
what the fuck is wrong with you ?
you took my ice cream records .
ice cube !
they' re sick !
would you really shoot me ?
hell . no .
you had that alabama look .
you' re lucky i didn' t have a fire hose .
you think this girl could be it ?
yeah .
i do .
hey , go for it .
yeah ?
i' m out of it .
are you serious ?
i hope she makes you happy .
merry christmas , man .
merry christmas to you , too .
the department says we must have backup in the christmas season .
shut up and stay out of our way .
we didn' t ask for this assignment .
we' re not here to steal anything .
they' re pissed off because we beat up their buddies on day shift .
everybody chill .
we' re here to help you out .
there' s just a little bit too much testosterone in here .
back to your stations .
we' ve got a schedule to keep .
dooley ...
you gonna take in a lot tonight ?
yeah . three or four million .
that' s money .
stop drooling .
just taking a few mental notes .
check out that grate .
look alive .
we' ve got something up ahead .
just tunnel workers .
you' re in my place .
stop poking me with that thing .
shut the fuck up !
stop pushing me .
you ain' t gonna hit him ...
i' m gonna hit him .
beautiful !
is she your wife ?
no . sir .
your girlfriend ?
no . sir .
perhaps your sister ?
that would make sense .
a white brother . a black brother ... ... and a latino sister .
officer grace santiago , sir .
you boys are lucky .
how did you get so lucky ?
are they lucky , officer santiago ?
i don' t know what you mean , sir .
having you as a partner .
i' il try my best to do my job .
i' m sure .
you' re dismissed .
this doesn' t concern you , officer santiago .
you boys , you don' t listen .
this time you may have your nuts in a wringer .
the first time my train was only late , this time it' s light .
light ?
sit down .
it seems that in the darkness somebody made off with $25, 000 .
how could that happen ?
why ask us ?
you' re a bad gambler .
you' re in debt up to your eyeballs .
you' re good at losing money .
how do you think i lost mine ?
do you think we' re behind this ?
did i say that ?
all i said was that bad things seem to happen around you to .
some money got ... lost .
i think you can help me find it .
how so ?
you look for it .
if you dig down in that commode that you call a soul ,
you' il come up with something .
i didn' t ask to be disturbed .
you might want to hear this .
get out of here .
you' re dismissed .
dismissed ?
dismissed .
one second you' re calling us crooks , the next we' re just dismissed .
the money has been recovered .
a collection agent confessed .
what happened to that money train model that was on your desk ?
yeah . when i didn' t see it .
i was heartbroken .
it' s just gone .
i bet it took ages to make .
you' re a wreck looking for someplace to happen .
i' il be there ... and i' il fuck you dead .
does he want to fuck us to death ?
when we' re dead . he' il fuck us .
either way , it' s a pain in the ass .
fuck him .
thinking i stole the money .
that' s insulting .
i thought you stole it , too .
you did ?
that' s all right , you' re family .
that son of a bitch ...
what ?
look over there .
it' s wollman rink .
last night , those repair guys came up a ladder into the park .
i see what you' re saying .
stop the train near the rink .
use the ladder to climb up and take away the cash .
we disappear into the park .
it' il never work .
how much do you think we can get ?
three or four million . at least .
we could be rich .
free .
and our people deserve it .
say it loud .
i' m black and i' m proud .
we' re talking " lifestyles of the rich and famous " .
we could take cruise ships .
island to island .
we' d be like boat people , but rich .
we could just buy an island .
now you' re talking .
we could buy mali .
or bali .
tahiti .
we wouldn' t have to put up with any more crap from patterson .
we don' t deserve that .
let the sharks eat him .
let' s do it .
here' s what i' m saying ...
talk to me .
the best possible time to pull this off is new year' s eve .
it' il be loaded with currency .
it' il just be fat !
where did you learn that word ?
mtv raps .
it' s my heritage .
what do you think ?
charlie . come back to earth .
calm down .
what are you talking about ?
we' re not going to rob the train .
why not ?
we' re cops ...
serve , protect , break a mother' s neck .
we can do this .
no ...
it would be no problem .
i' m telling you .
it' s easy .
put that away before somebody thinks you got it for christmas .
don' t let me interrupt .
it was too hot inside .
so you' re getting down .
salsa .
i love this .
i grew up with this .
i' m from the bronx .
let' s see what you' ve got .
i' m very surprised .
e street .

you' re teaching me something now .
you' ve got to learn from somebody .
watch out now .
i might throw a spin on you .
it' s rough the first time .
we need to get some practice in .
we were dancing .
that was nice .
don' t just leave me hanging .
slow music ?
no ...
i don' t dance to slow music .
don' t you like slow music ?
how would it look for me to step up to you like that ... ... and start dancing with you close and stuff like that ?
that could work .
i' ve got a confession to make ?
what' s that ?
this is the first time i ever danced with a cop .
me . too .
i hope that' s your gun .
yeah , it' s poking me , too .
maybe it' s my gun .
put your stuff in the back .
put your stuff in the back .
i think i should go in .
we don' t want people talking .
we wouldn' t want that .

don' t touch the window .
fresh air .
it' s cold outside .
you' ve got to get fresh air .
you' re not in the alps .
it' s good for your lungs .
not in new york .

i' ve been out .
grace ?
i' ve been out with grace all night , and god , i' m feeling good .
all night ?
all night , and i feel all right .
