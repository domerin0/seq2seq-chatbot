there' s been another murder .
you remember i said my friend gave the brief to a friend at the fbl ?
the fbl friend was killed yesterday .
how do you know ?
i was holding his hand .
he was shot ... ... in broad daylight in a crowd .
i' m very sorry .
i' m in new york now .
when can you come ?
you' il have to give me something i can confirm .
we get many calls from people claiming to know who killed rosenberg and jensen .
something you can confirm ?
please .
such as ?
the name of the friend that was murdered in the car explosion .
take your time .
callahan .
his first name ?
thomas .
where did it happen ?
in new orleans .
i think that should be enough .
all right .
what' s the name of the friend that worked at the fbl ?
verheek .
gavin verheek .
voyles ' chief counsel .
i think that' s more than enough .
i' il be on a plane this afternoon .
you must follow my instructions .
this is gray grantham .
that' s right .
got it .
did you follow my instructions ?
you must think i' m crazy .
yes , i did ... ... till i checked new orleans .
callahan was ... ... killed exactly as you said .
i also check on verheek .
according to the fbl ... ... they found his body 2 days ago ... ... in a hotel room early in the morning .
he' d been dead for at least 8 hours .
that can' t be .
want to talk about the brief ?
everyone i' ve told about the brief is dead .
i' il take my chances .
you can' t , under any circumstances , use my name ... ... or reveal how you got the information .
or publish anything until i' ve left the country .
agreed ?
unless i can convince you otherwise .
you can' t .
may i sit down ?
mind if i use a tape recorder ?
interesting read , isn' t it ?
what' d the president say ?
he spoke to voyles ... ... who will leave it alone for a while .
the president asked voyles to back off ?
we thought it was just another shot in the dark .
now i' m not sure .
that' s obstruction of justice .
assuming the brief turns out to be true .
if it does , you' il be the fall guy .
i won' t be the only one .
the old nixon two step .
don' t even think that name .
look at the hopeful side , irangate , iraqgate ...
good chance it won' t come out .
what' s up with grantham ?
we got his car phone .
we haven' t been inside the home yet .
why not ?
we almost got caught by the cleaning lady .
grantham knows about the brief .
he called 3 white house aides today ... ... and god knows who else .
what made you hone in on this particular case so quickly ?
i remembered this piece that " frontline " did a year ago ... ... about the young lawyer who originally filed the suit .
they said he' d committed suicide , but his family thought it was foul play .
after the assassinations , i called his family .
they said he had a depressive problem years before ... ... but medication had taken care of it .
his doctor confirmed what the family said .
they told the police they were not convinced it was suicide .
but the police closed the investigation .
exactly .
that' s it .
that' s the brief .
maybe we could ... ... finish up in the morning ?
i' il stay up and go over my notes ... ... while they' re fresh in my head .
call me when you wake up .
try and get some sleep .
i know it sounds silly , but ... ... would you sleep on the sofa ?
no problem .
good night .
listen ...
at the risk of sounding old fashioned ... ... isn' t it time i knew your real name ?
darby shaw .
what made you pick me , darby shaw ?
callahan was a fan .
does the name victor mattiece mean anything to you ?
money ... ... power ... ... influence ...
he' s made and lost several fortunes drilling for oil in south louisiana .
in 1979 ... ... his oil company punched some holes in terrebonne parish and hit oil .
a lot of oil .
he needed governmental permission ... ... to dredge a channel though the marshlands to get the oil out .
enter mattiece , the great campaign contributor ... ... and as night follows day ... ... government permission to gouge through the endangered marshes .
mattiece is that close to at least a billion dollars ... ... when green fund ... ... an obscure environmental outfit ... ... trots down to the u. s. district court in lafayette and files a lawsuit ... ... to stop the entire operation .
of course , mattiece spares no expense to win the lawsuit .
i don' t think there' s a top law firm between houston and new orleans ... ... that he hasn' t hired .
fucking pbs !
by the time the green fund lawyers ... ... all two of them ... ... wade in , the joint ventures ... ... limited partnerships and corporate associations ... ... form an impenetrable maze that makes mattiece invisible .
osprey , egrets , pelicans , ducks , cranes , geese .
the pelican becomes the hero .
after 30 years of contamination by ddt and other pesticides ... ... the louisiana brown pelican is on the brink of extinction .
green fund seizes the bird and enlists experts ... ... from around the country to testify on its behalf .
it takes 7 years for the pelican suit to go to trial in lake charles .
the 3 man jury , caring less about the pelicans than jobs ... ... votes in favor of mattiece .
but the judge rules to keep the injunction against drilling because ... ... he thinks green fund has proven its point about the pelican ... ... a federally protected species , and that it will appeal .
what' s the lawsuit' s status ?
from the trial level ... ... it will be appealed to the court of appeals in new orleans in a month .
any idea what the court will do ?
it could be reversed .
then the fun starts .
if either side is unhappy with the court ... ... they can appeal to the supreme court .
from today , how long would it take for a decision by the supreme court ?
anywhere from 3 to 5 years .
rosenberg would have died .
but another president could be in the white house when he died .
so if you' re mattiece ... ... and you don' t mind killing a couple of supremes ... ... now' s the time to kill them , when you can predict their replacement .
but why jensen ?
protecting the environment .
i didn' t mean to wake you .
you said that mattiece hired law firms from houston to new orleans .
were there any in washington ?
maybe two .
white & blazevich ...
... and brim , stearns & somebody .
great !
i got a call from a lawyer in d. c ... ... who saw something concerning rosenberg and jensen .
he backed out of our meeting .
i never heard from him again .
he gave me a phony name , but i got his picture .
how ?
long story .
if he works at one of these law firms , he could be our confirmation .
i hope you find him .
come with me to washington .
i' ve had enough .
if you' re right about mattiece , then there' il be a cover up .
it' il probably work .
how do you know ?
i called the herald morgue last night .
two years ago , a reporter did a piece ... ... on " violations of campaign financing laws .
he found out that , hidden under a lot of other names of individuals ... ... and pac' s and corporations , mattiece was the biggest contributor ... ... by far ... ... to the president' s campaign .
we ran a picture , with the article , of the president and mattiece .
it was taken unbeknownst to either one .
in it , the president and mattiece are in front of mattiece' s hunting lodge ... ... sipping on some bourbon , having a good laugh .
the best of pals .
the president' s most secret ...
... and generous contributor .
now , if your brief is right and it ever reaches the light of day ... ... the president loses any chance of reelection .
the men around the president won' t let that happen .
i checked with my sources .
the bureau , langley , the white house ... ... all said the brief doesn' t exist .
you may be the only witness to the fact there is a brief .
if you disappear ... ... so does justice .
is that what callahan would want ?
he' d want me to see my 25th birthday .
if this thing reaches as deep and goes as high as we think it does ... ... they' il do anything not to be exposed .
where can you hide ?
go back to washington .
they' il all shook up about you asking about something .
i expected that .
it' s like the gestapo over there .
coal clears everything .
they put me on medical leave for 90 days .
what' s wrong with you ?
i don' t know .
one thing i do know , i' ve never seen it this bad .
i' m worried about you , son .
gray , it' s darby .
when you hear this , i' il be in the air on my way to nowhere .
try to understand .
i can' t keep you on that story .
i' m sending you to arkansas .
the times , the networks ... ... are there checking out the judge they' re about to nominate .
i need more time .
for what ?
you lost your white house sources , you' ve lost garcia and the girl .
not your best week .
you can' t take me off this story .
what do you know for fact ?
an unidentified guy says he knows about the assassinations .
he works in a law firm ; you don' t know which one .
he' s cut off all contact .
that' s not very promising .
there' s something there , i can smell it .
evidence based on olfactory prowess is inadmissible , in case you didn' t know .
then there' s a girl ... ... with her bird brief for which you can' t get confirmation .
yet .
she also cut off contact , something that' s reaching epidemic proportions .
they' re waiting for you upstairs .
everything she said about the two deaths has been confirmed .
the fbl says verheek was killed in some hotel mugging .
that' s what you told me .
that' s what they told me .
and they said they knew of no connection with the assassinations .
what else would they say ?
i' m interested in what they did say .
let' s look at what i have confirmed .
callahan was killed in a car explosion .
they had an affair .
give it to the times picayune .
maybe they want some gossip .
i also found that callahan clerked for rosenberg 20 years ago .
life is filled with odd coincidence .
not a coincidence if the brief
you have no confirmation there is a brief .
i confirmed verheek and callahan were friends .
they met here a few weeks ago , when he must have given him the brief .
supposition again .
i' ve confirmed the pelican lawsuit .
on which she has based her suppositions .
it' s all just suppositions .
you know what mattiece could do ?
i know what he has done already .
he has a bizarre history .
so do i , according to my ex wife .
it doesn' t mean that i killed the justices .
but it means it' s worth exploring .
go down to that crappy cabin of yours on the weekend , hole up , retrench .
prove you have a way to revitalize this story , and i might keep you on it .
but if i were you , i' d check where to eat in little rock .
this is the story of a mystery that may never be solved .
the story of a brilliant young lawyer who loved this land ... ... and wanted to fight to preserve it from the inroads of man ... ... until his abrupt death ... ... a few months ago .
his body was found in a lonely cottage , near the bayou he so loved .
there was a bullet in his head ... ... and a gun beside him .
the coroner and police have deemed it a suicide .
but he died sitting at a computer , surrounded by his notes ... ... for what he called the case he was born to win .
his friends and family ask ... ... would anyone commit suicide in such a manner ... ... at such a time ?
tonight , frontline explores the death of a young idealist .
who' s there ?
it' s darby !
i got your message .
if they bugged your phone , i wanted them to think i left the country .
did you find that lawyer in d. c. ?
not yet .
my editor wants to take me off the story .
i could help you find him .
how' d you find me ?
i called your editor .
he told you ?
i told him i was your sister mary from out of town and couldn' t find you .
how' d you know i had a sister mary ?
you' re not the only one doing research .
it was a beautiful service .
i' il have an announcement after the weekend .
it was the right thing to do , no matter where the body was found .
you can' t announce the nominations next week .
you said they' d be vetted this weekend .
there must be a change in plans .
i don' t understand .
the pelican brief .
what about the pelican brief ?
i thought that was ancient history .
we believe that grantham' s gotten a hold of it .
mattiece will sue the pants off them if they try to publish that .
not if it' s true .
you think it' s true ?
a man who gave the president millions ...
... had two supreme court justices killed so his pal , the president ...
... could appoint more reasonable men to the bench ...
... so that his oil could be harvested .
if voyles says you told him to back off the case , we face an obstruction charge .
oh , jesus !
there' s a way to handle this .
handle it how ?
we appoint two nature lovers to the court .
good environmentalists who' d kill mattiece and his oil field .
meet with voyles , in the presence of the attorney general ... ... and demand an immediate investigation into mattiece .
i' il leak copies of the brief to every reporter in town .
then we ride out the storm .
but there has to be some way to keep this information from coming out .
i' m working on it .
what ?
how ?
mr. president ... ... you don' t want to know .
what' s this all about ?
a trip to mt .
vernon will do you good .
are you losing it ?
first i order you to go to little rock , you refuse to go .
you refuse to tell me why , then you order me ... ... your boss , i might add ... ... to drop everything and meet you at george' s place .
i thought of making you unemployed ... ... but you' d sue me for discrimination .
she' s here .
the bird girl ?
she' s here .
you could' ve told me .
not wise .
by the way , refusing to tell me where you could be reached ... ... didn' t leave a good impression .
it' s too risky to go to my apartment or to the job .
where have you been ?
in a little hotel .
this is a hell of a time to punch notches in your belt .
we' re not in the same hotel .
she' s helping me find garcia .
it sounds like she' s in control .
it' s the only way she' d play .
so what if you can' t find garcia ?
we go to plan b.
what' s that ?
we attack the lawyers directly .
what if it' s another firm ?
we go to plan c.
what' s that ?
we didn' t go that far .
what if you do ?
i must be able to get in touch with you .
i' m at the marbury hotel , room 833 .
don' t use my name .
write it down .
you mind getting off at the next exit ?
why ?
a tan car' s been two cars behind us ... ... since we got on the parkway .
i thought it was following us .
right .
georgetown law school , please .
hurry .
meet me by the stacks .
someone was in my room .
did you tell anyone where you were ?
smith keen , but he' d never repeat it .
did you tell him by phone ?

i' il keep looking for akers .
it' s me again .

parklane hospital .
good afternoon .
i' m here to see edward linney .
what room is he in ?
what' s your name ?
gray grantham , washington herald .
the law school said i could see him .
i' m sorry they did .
we run this hospital and they run their law school .
may i see your administrator ?
i' il see if i can find him .
great architecture .
i' m sorry , mr. grantham .
visitation is only allowed on the weekend ... ... and then only family .
when will he be discharged ?
i' m afraid that' s confidential .
perhaps when his insurance expires ?
do you recognize that man ?
what' s his name ?
that' s the point , i don' t know .
what is his name ?
he works in the oil and gas section on the 9th floor .
morgan .
morgan .
his first name' s something like ... ... charles , but that' s not it .
i can' t tell you how grateful i am .
when you opened the door ... ... i thought i was hallucinating .
i' m sorry .
i' il take a hallucination like that ... ... anytime .
take care of yourself .
excuse me , miss .
what' re you doing ?
visiting my brother .
who is your brother ?
edward linney .
this your sister ?
leave her alone .
mom will come on the weekend .
sis ?
come back soon .
i' il try .
i know you' d agree with me about the horrendous cost of health care .
of course , of course .
we pride ourselves on our enlightened policy regarding payment .
thank you very much for your time .
we' il be happy to have you back on any of our normal visiting days .
curtis morgan , oil and gas .
white & blazevich , please .
second floor .
use the escalator .
may i help you ?
dorothy blythe , to see curtis morgan .
have a seat .
i' il be right with you .
you have a meeting with mr. morgan ?
yes , at five .
when did you make the appointment ?
2 weeks ago .
may i ask why ?
obviously , i need an oil and gas lawyer .
curtis morgan is dead .
why didn' t anyone call me ?
we have no record of your appointment .
what happened ?
he was mugged a week ago .
shot by street punks , we believe .
do you have some identification ?
he' s security .
security for what ?
come with us , you should see someone else .
after this treatment , i have no interest in talking to anyone in this firm .
they killed him !
i can' t breathe !
it' s all right .
just let it go .
let it go .
it' s all right .
we ran the story about a week ago .
it' s just another mugging .
didn' t make the metro front page .
curtis morgan ... ... 225 willow road , bethesda .
225 willow road ... ... bethesda .
that' s what i wanted .
report in before noon tomorrow .
we' re nervous over here .
you know ... ... good help is hard to find .
i' m going with you .
look at me .
i want you to leave .
and if you need confirmation for your story ?
i' m on my own .
what' s changed your mind ?
i want you to reach 25 .
i' m coming .
this is anne .
good evening .
i' m grantham of the herald .
this is my assistant .
could we see mrs. morgan ?
i' m her father .
she won' t talk .
i respect her privacy .
i know she' s been through an ordeal .
when did you people ever respect anyone' s privacy ?
i feel that way about most reporters .
but her husband called me ... ... three times before he died .
i don' t believe his death was accidental .
she doesn' t want to talk .
get the hell out of here .
you change your mind ... ... i' il be at this number .
this is mrs. morgan .
do you still want to see me ?
did you know your husband called me ?
how would he know anything about those dead judges ?
i have no idea .
did he keep any ... ... unusual documents ... ... or papers ?
we have a lock box at the bank for deeds and wills .
i looked at it last thursday .
there was nothing unusual in it .
on saturday morning ... ... i was going through his ... ... desk in the bedroom .
i found something a bit unusual .
a key .
a key to what ?
another lock box .
which bank ?
riggs bank .
we' ve never banked there .
and you knew nothing about this other ... ... box ?
not until saturday morning .
i figured ... ... i' il run by when i felt up to it .
maybe you should check it , mrs. morgan .
could be a clue to who killed him .
are you saying curtis was killed ... ... because he knew something about these assassinations ?
that' s exactly what i' m saying .
do you think there may be papers in the safe deposit box ... ... that may reveal what curtis knew about the assassinations ?
there could be .
my child' s lost one parent .
i can' t let her lose another .
i' il check it for you .
no one has to know you have the key .
they will only give it to his wife .
my partner' s a woman .
she' s trustworthy .
i would have one condition .
if you find something that disparages my husband in any way , you can' t use it .
you have my word , mrs. morgan .
where are the safe deposit boxes ?
down those steps .
i need access to a box , please .
the number , please ?
616 .
this box was rented 2 weeks ago .
i assume you' re mrs. morgan ?
sara ann morgan .
the address ?
225 willow road , bethesda .
phone number ?
301 555 7128 .
who rented this box ?
my husband , curtis d. morgan .
and his social security number ?
510 96 8686 .
will you sign here , please ?
may i help you ?
i' d like to rent a box .
will you have a seat ?
i' il be with you in a minute .
your key ?
yes , i do .
follow me .
it' s a four page affidavit ... ... signed under oath .
it' s dated the day before the last time he called me .
he worked at white & blazevich in the oil and gas section for 5 years .
listen to this !
during that time ... ... he worked for a client who was engaged in a lawsuit in louisiana .
the client was a man named victor mattiece ... ... who he' s never met .
lots about the lawsuit , how desperate mattiece was to win it .
just as if you wrote it .
a partner named sims wakefield ... ... supervised the case for w & b. morgan worked on a peripherated case .
he took files and documents that wakefield left for him ... ... not related to the case .
when he got back to his own office ... ... he found a handwritten memo on the bottom of the stack .
he' d inadvertently taken it from wakefield' s desk .
a copy of the memo is attached to the affidavit .
he copied the memo and left the memo under the files on his desk .
next stop , washington herald !
stop !
get out of the car !
there was a car explosion in a garage near the riggs bank .
the police traced the car to a leasing agency .
it was rented yesterday by grantham .
have you heard from grantham ?
not since yesterday .
i should' ve taken him off that story .
what story ?
see what you can find .
smith keen ... ... meet darby shaw .
what the hell is going on ?
sweetheart , i' m down here in the basement .
it' s about two in the morning .
this is an affidavit ... ... concerning a memo i found on my desk .
i' m going to trust you to do with it what you will .
the memo' s from velmano , he' s a senior partner .
sims , advise client research is complete .
the bench will sit much softer if the old man is retired .
the second retirement is a bit unusual .
jensen , of all people .
advise further that the pelican should arrive here in 4 years ...
... assuming other factors .
there' s no signature .
then justices rosenberg and jensen were killed .
i firmly believe that this is the work of mattiece and his associates .
memo doesn' t mention mattiece , but it refers to a client .
wakefield had no other clients .
and no client had as much to gain from the new court .
i thought that i was protecting us by not revealing what i found .
you' il only see this if i' m gone , so i will have failed .
i' m sorry , sweetheart .
i' il always be with you .
always .
this is marty velmano .
what a pleasure !
what can i do for you ?
we' re doing a story about victor mattiece ... ... and his involvement in the deaths of rosenberg and jensen .
great !
we' il sue you for the next 20 years .
you' il be named as a defendant .
oh , this will be great .
victor mattiece will own the herald .
have you heard of the pelican brief ?
we have a copy of it .
we also have a copy of a memo sent by you to sims wakefield ... ... in which you suggest your client' s position would be greatly improved ... ... by the removal of rosenberg and jensen from the court .
i noticed you waited till five .
an hour earlier , we could' ve run to court , stopped this .
you deny you wrote the memo ?
it' s a fabrication .
you have no lawsuit , mr. velmano .
you know it .
you son of a bitch !
mr. coal ?
have you read the pelican brief ?
i have .
we' re running a story which verifies the facts set forth in that brief .
we' ve confirmed mattiece contributed over $4 million ... ... to the president' s last campaign .
4, 200, 000 , all through legal channels .
that' s right .
we believe the white house tried to obstruct the fbl investigation ... ... and we wonder if there are any comments .
the white house denies any direct or indirect involvement ... ... in this investigation .
you' ve received some bad information .
mr. voyles , it' s grantham .
we' re running a story detailing a conspiracy ... ... in the murders of rosenberg and jensen .
we' re naming mattiece , an oil speculator , and two of his lawyers .
we believe the fbl knew about mattiece ... ... but didn' t investigate at the urging of the white house .
any comments ?
i think we' il have great success with these people .
they were really very pleased ... ... and genuinely cooperative .
what' s up ?
you know gray grantham .
and this is darby shaw .
so you' re the little lady who started this great brouhaha .
i think you have me confused with the president' s friend .
i have some comments for the record .
first , we got the pelican brief two weeks ago ... ... and submitted it to the white house on the same day .
it was not considered high priority in the investigation until gavin verheek ... ... special counsel to the director , was found murdered .
did the white house interfere in the fbl investigation of mattiece ?
i' il discuss it ... ... off the record .
last wednesday the president asked me to ignore victor mattiece as a suspect .
in his words ... ... he asked me to " back off .
i have a tape ... ... which i will allow no one to hear ... ... unless the president first denies this .
so what do you do now ?
there' il be a grand jury by noon tomorrow .
quick indictments .
and we' il find mattiece .
i' d like a few minutes alone with ms. shaw .
if she doesn' t mind .
it' s her call .
i' d like mr. grantham to stay .
what' s next for you ?
who killed the man disguised as verheek ?
oh , you mean the assassin , khamel .
off the record , khamel was killed by a contract operative ... ... hired independently by the cla .
rupert ?
he probably has 20 names .
why was he following her ?
i think the brief initially scared giminski more than anyone .
and he probably ... ... sent rupert ... ... to trail darby ... ... in part to watch and in part to protect .
we can help .
what do you want ?
to leave the country , alone .
all right .
we' il get you out of this building , put you on my plane .
we' il fly you anywhere you want and you can disappear .
but you must allow me to contact you ... ... through mr. grantham ... ... if , and only if , it becomes urgently necessary .
that' s fine .
i want no one on the plane but me , gray and the pilots .
after takeoff , i' il tell the pilot where to go .
he has to file a flight plan before he can leave .
you' re the director of the fbl .
set it up .
our guest today is gray grantham ... ... who has , as just about everyone in america knows ... ... revealed the plot behind the assassinations of rosenberg and jensen .
the ripple effects of this story just don' t seem to stop .
as of this broadcast , victor mattiece , one of the country' s richest men ... ... has been indicted , along with 4 aides and lawyers .
fletcher coal , the president' s chief of staff , has resigned .
and we' re getting strong indications that the president himself ... ... will not run again .
that' s what we know .
let' s get to what we don' t .
we know the pelican brief was written by a woman named darby shaw ... ... but we don' t know who that is .
who is darby shaw ?
that' s a question for darby shaw .
that leads me to my next question .
speaking for many of our colleagues ... ... who are in a feeding frenzy to interview her ... ... where is darby shaw ?
that' s also a question for darby shaw .
but she' s not available ... ... to answer questions until the feeding frenzy stops .
does that mean you don' t know where she is ?
i didn' t say that .
then you do know .
i take it this cryptic smile means ... ... you' re not answering .
in view of all this , you know that ... ... there' s speculation ... ... that this woman is a figment of your imagination .
that you created her from a lot of different sources .
just as there are people who believe there was no deep throat ... ... there are those who believe there is no darby shaw .
in other words , she' s just too good to be true .
she almost is .
