shoeshine
that horse is a great horse .
yeah , he' s a really great horse .
as soon as i said , " go , bersagliere , " he started off like a rocket .
i don' t think there is another one like that .
not even in america .
that' s nonsense .
in america ...
who knows how much they feed horses over there !
i told you not to leave the horse when you come down .
you call this a horse ?
and what is it ?
it' s a small table .
mr. anucci , that one is always kidding around !
is the proposal still good ?
50 or nothing .
but 50 bills are 50 bills .
what are they ?
only paper !
easy to say !
everybody thinks since we' re shoeshine boys we make money by the bundle .
come on , let' s go !
is it really expensive to have a horse ?
at least 300 lira a day .
goodness , bersagliere , how expensive you are !
mr. anucci , 50 is okay , but know we are a little short .
can we do it in a week ?
it' s okay with me .
your word ?
my word .
your word ?
my word .
goodbye , mr. anucci .
goodbye .
it' s right .
until the horse is ours , he can rent it out to anybody he wishes .
how much do we have on hand ?
i' m not sure , 32 , 35 .
why don' t you know ?
i told you to be accurate !
you' re right , but this morning i made a lot of payments .
here .
five , 10 .
i made all stacks of five .
that' s good .
15 , 20 , 25 , 30 , 31 , 32 , 33 , 500 .
plus 7 , 500 for the guy from genoa .
and the 3, 700 for the porter' s lodge .
33 , 500 plus 3, 700 and 7 , 500 ... we are short 5 , 300 lira .
marcello , did the stuff arrive ?
no , not yet !
it' s already a week that the prick tells me ,
tomorrow , tomorrow .
and in the meantime , he gets his shoes shined .
when you bring ?
tomorrow !
to you and your mother !
these pay , you know ?
hey , pasquale , do you want to buy this ?
no , they' re just a headache .
you can' t hide them or cover them up .
forget it , someone else will buy them .
let' s go .
what kind of a fool are you , laughing all by yourself ?
i' m thinking that one eats more than we do .
who ?
the horse !
right , shoeshine joe ?
how can we do it ?
i' ve been thinking about taking him by the one at port san sebastian .
that one will starve him to death !
right , we were born yesterday !
after work , we go and have him fed in front of us .
yes , but that way he would eat only once !
i didn' t think about that .
i could sleep in the stable .
and me ?
right , and at your house ?
no one will cry if i free up the space .
we' il see !
for the moment let' s worry about making the money .
giuseppe .
what' s up ?
giuseppe , please ...
shoeshine joe .
on the last curve , pasquale told him , " go , bersagliere ! " and he started off like a ...
running in circles ?
get lost !
i meant to say ...
get lost !
what do i do ?
when will you bring me chocolate ?
don' t sell it , eat it !
do i look stupid ?
thank you .
what' s killing us is that we aren' t organized .
if we were , the guards wouldn' t have taken the sausages from us .
from me they took two .
what will they do with them ?
they sell them .
pasquale .
hi , annarella .
where is giuseppe ?
i need to talk to him .
giuseppe !
hi .
hi .
i was sent over by your mother .
she needs 300 lira .
what ?
i gave her 500 this morning .
she said she needs the money .
can i ?
yes , of course .
money has sure lost its value .
last year i' d give my mother 200 lire and we' d all eat .
lucky you , you don' t have anybody .
once you eat , everybody has .
nonsense .
if i still had my mother and father ,
i would gladly give them a million a day !
now you' re staying with us .
don' t you like it ?
i do .
who say s i don' t ?
well , let' s go now !
you don' t sleep in the elevator anymore ?
no .
the landlord , may he drop dead , found out .
at night he calls it upstairs and i can' t go in it .
now i sleep with giuseppe at quaranta alighieri .
i won' t tell you the racket .
shoeshine joe !
the other day i took him to the hotel , he gave me a big chocolate cake with ice cream inside !
damn , if i' d known i would have come too .
i know , but they don' t let women inside .
hey , giuseppe .
hi .
where is pasquale ?
working in front of fori imperiali .
who' s he ?
he' s attilio , my big brother .
he must be rich , huh ?
yes .

thank you .
he found the note .
him ?
he' s a wise guy .
he' s in here for armed robbery .
with a machine gun !
there were a bunch of them , they were stealing cars too .
his father is a doctor , you know ?
i don' t like him .
that' s because you don' t know him well .
i like the others too .
i wish you could come with us .
maggi pasquale , filippucci giuseppe .
that' s us .
let' s go to see the warden .
the police chief wants you .
why did you fire those two masters ?
they were stealing from the boys ' packages .
they were trading cigarettes .
unfortunately , nowadays , poverty is turning everybody into a criminal .
here are the two guys .
come on , come on , step forward .
so , you stated you don' t know the three men that went into the home of mrs. donati anselmi ,
isn' t that so ?
yes .
but you know mr. anucci , don' t you ?
yes .
yes .
okay , good !
this man came to see me yesterday and told me he sold you a black horse .
no , he' s white .
yes , right , a white one .
i misread .
a white horse , for 50 , 000 lire , correct ?
yes .
yes .
and you bought him about one hour after ... the burglary in via babuino .
you know , i understand where you' re going but you' re wrong .
we had the money already .
is that so ?
and how did you make that money ?
that' s our business .
listen , boys , i' ve come here with good intentions .
i want to help you .
yesterday i spoke with your father .
the man is out of his mind .
he said to tell me the whole truth .
it' s the only way for you to be forgiven .
we told you the whole truth .
we know nothing .
chief , you are too nice .
give them to me .
i' il make them sing , these criminals , with a good beating !
did you hear ?
why do you want to get beat up , and end up in a dark cell with rats ?
to defend who ?
three criminals ?
i' d understand if it were someone in your family , but you , you are all alone .
and you , your parents are poor but honest people .
listen , chief , you can kill us if you want , but we can' t tell you what we don' t know .
too bad !
the smaller one .
don' t worry , your turn will come .
undress him .
take off his shirt too .
do you want to speak ?
no , please , enough !
that' s enough !
then have you made up your mind ?
give me the names .
we don' t know anything , i swear .
enough , enough .
i' il tell you everything .
so ?
one is called panza .
the other is attilio , giuseppe' s brother .
the third i don' t know , i swear ...
i never saw him before .
giuseppe !
take him to his cell .
well , let' s go .
what about this guy ?
giuseppe .
pasquale .
so , did they hurt you ?
no , what about you ?
me neither !
didn' t they use the belt on you ? are you kidding ?
you didn' t say anything , did you ?
no , no , i didn' t say anything .
i told you to come here , damn it !
what did he want ?
nothing , he wanted to know if they beat me up .
what happened to you ?
nothing .
why ?
you should see your face .
it' s my face .
if you don' t like it ... don' t look at it .
why are you here ?
do you have a visitor ?
no , nobody .
then what are doing here ?
mario , take him .
i' m busy .
you watch him .
come here .
my mother , where is she ?
di dio .
that' s me .
she' s not my mother .
his mother sent me .
she wrote asking me to come and see you .
here' s the postcard .
where is she ?
in florence .
she went to florence , but she' il come soon , you know .
i brought you this package .
there is a lot of stuff in it .
thank you .
goodbye .
take care , my boy .
good morning .
good morning .
pasquale , my mother is here .
i' il see you in the courtyard .
giuseppe !
come on , move !
mom !
do you forgive me , mama ?
how could you do something like this ?
i wasn' t involved , mama .
we didn' t know anything ... and didn' t do anything !
he is a criminal , i know .
he is wretched ... but he is your brother .
you must not spy on him .
what are you saying , mama ?
don' t pretend .
the police chief told me it was you two that talked .
okay , okay , attilio is nothing , but you !
raffaele , kiss him for me .
tell him his mother will be back soon .
she' il bring money for a lawyer , so he can get out quickly .
things are very good for me in florence .
much better than rome .
your devoted , teresa di dio .
how far is florence ?
not far .
i know someone who has a truck and drives there once a week .
then it' s close !
eat , pasquale !
no , thank you .
take some , take it .
don' t touch that .
it' s his stuff !
he' s sick , he needs it !
spy , spy , spy ...
what happened ?
you should be ashamed .
we give you a little freedom and you take advantage of it immediately .
what happened ?
he' s a spy .
that' s not true !
behave , boys !
i don' t want to pay because of you .
behave !
i don' t want to get rusty in here because of you .
behave !
behave , boys !
i need to speak with you .
what do you want ?
none of your business .
who says so ?
i say so .
listen , napoli , you get off easier because you are sick , but watch what you say .
okay .
you don' t want to speak with me ?
if you' re bringing a message from that spy you' d better save your breath .
you don' t have much of it to spare .
good , you gave him a good answer .
hey , riccardo .
go , giuseppe , now is the time .
you' ve got to go .
you swore .
if you don' t , you' re a coward .
what are you saying ?
of course you' re going !
mr. staffera , in cell number 9 they have a file .
what ?
they' re hiding a file .
damn it !
maybe if i' d spoken to him i' d have convinced him .
you' re smart , but that was wrong .
he' s the one who has to come and apologize .
i don' t understand , you were such good friends .
you liked each other .
it' s a shame .
me , i still like him .
but if he ...
those in cell 9 .
whose file is this ?
who does it belong to ?
whose file is this ?
who knows ?
whose file is this ?
i swear by the mother of christ ... !
whose file is this ?
i don' t know .
never saw it before .
whose file is this ?
i don' t know !
get out , get out .
who does it belong to ?
i swear on my honor that ...
who sleeps here ?
i do .
this file was found in your mattress .
it can' t be .
it can' t be ?
then , i' m a liar , is that it ?
no , i mean , it' s not mine .
i didn' t put it there .
then you' re accusing your mates of putting it in there ?
i' m not accusing anybody .
the file is yours .
who gave it you ?
what were you gonna do ?
nothing .
nobody gave it to me .
it' s not mine , you see , it' s not mine .
out !
out !
all of you !
no , no , enough !
stop it !
stop it !
inside .
lock them in .
stop crying !
you twit .
don' t you remember you sent your brother to jail ?
everybody will know it was you who spied on staffera .
dry your tears , baby .
here comes staffera .
what' s your name ?
filippucci giuseppe .
good .
if he becomes head of the group we' ve got it made .
now look at him ... stupid !
stop it !
are you feeling sick ?
i' m burning all over .
my father has a very helpful ointment .
i' d like to know who put the file there .
when i find out , i' il smash his head , i swear to god !
even if i end up at regina cieli .
come on , pasquale , they all think you spied so you have to understand ...
but it' s not true !
hey , napoli , what' s his story ?
did he spy or not ?
drop dead !
you could have told me .
i told raffaele .
at first , even he didn' t believe me .
me ?
yes !
imagine the others !
now , i don' t care if they believe me or not .
i want to know who put the file in the mattress .
just forget about it .
it' s over .
over ?
i mean ... well , okay ... tomorrow i' il talk to giuseppe .
you have to make peace , okay ?
for me !
yes , for you , i' il get him to make peace .
it' s impossible to sleep in here .
stop all that !
i spoke with him .
come .
he' s the one that has to come to me .
my goodness , what a pair you are !
he says you have to come , you sayhe has to come .
let' s compromise .
just meet halfway , okay ?
okay , halfway .
finally !
damn it !
what bad shape they put you in !
did you go to the doctor ?
no .
be careful , he washes you with soap .
does it hurt ?
yes , it hurts , but it' il go away .
so , did you make up your mind ?
damn it !
you' re making such a fuss !
listen , boy ... did you tell him who put the file in the mattress ?
no , i didn' t tell him .
and not even who asked me to do it .
as far as i' m concerned , you can tell him .
what should i do ?
whatever you want .
if you have the courage to help the person that sent your brother to jail ... go ahead .
you heard what righetto said , he did it because he thought they were beating me up .
damn it !
don' t listen to that moron .
moron ?
watch your mouth !
it' s the truth , giuseppe .
go ahead !
show them what you' re made of .
come on !
help , help , they' re killing him !
tends to be violent , dangerous to himself and others .
we recommend isolation .
master !
master !
what is it ?
i want to go to the bathroom .
just use what' s in there .
i see , but then ...
i don' t care .
i' m not the one staying in there .
you call that a horse ?
what do you know !
besides , i don' t like horses , they' re too slow !
you don' t know bersagliere !
he flies !
who is bersagliere ?
never mind .
you don' t know him .
someone give me a cigarette .
and how do we get them ?
i went to the infirmary .
we can see .
idiots !
i mean i' ve got everything ready ... to escape .
yes , but i' m the idiot wasting my time talking to you guys .
no , no , we' re listening .
with you i' il never be able to put anything together .
why ?
we' re ready .
you shut up !
indeed , i won' t say anything just because of you .
what did i do to you ?
you ganged up with pasquale .
yes , it' s true .
no , it isn' t true .
in fact , when i saw you on the floor looking like you were dead ...
okay , okay ...
so , when entering the infirmary ...
damn this one !
do you want to shut up ?
so ... the fence ... it' s fastened to the wall with an iron bar .
i' ve got everything ready .
really ?
i cut through a lot of bolts .
you just need to shake it hard to break it open .
i figured from the windowsill to the roof below there' s just about a couple of yards .
filippucci ?
here !
you have a visitor .
here he is , counselor .
thank you .
come here , my dear .
we have a lot to discuss .
i' ve been sent by bonavino , the lawyer hired by your family to defend you and your brother ...
attilio ...
attilio filippucci .
your name is giuseppe ?
yes .
your friend is ...
pasquale maggi ?
yes .
and his family ?
he has no family .
very well , it' s better that way .
our defense is that you didn' t want nor did you understand .
you have to say it was maggi that lured you into selling .
to do what ?
you have to say you knew nothing but your friend was aware of everything .
pasquale also knew nothing .
it was my brother who arranged everything .
well , good .
repeat that in court and you' il guarantee your brother is in for five years .
but it' s the truth .
save the truth for your confessor .
in court , you say what i tell you .
this famous horse could not have been bought , as the defense would want us to believe , with hard earned money .
it was money from illegal activities .
that' s absurd !
the stolen goods have been recovered .
where is the horse now ?
don' t answer .
if i didn' t know you well , counselor ,
i would think that in your vocabulary
horse " is synonymous with " lawyer' s fee .
you must be joking !
why did you buy the horse ?
to ride him !
ah , to ride him .
is that so ?
it' s the truth .
how much did you plan on making from him ?
sergeant , bring in maggi .
i bring to the attention of the court that maggi has been characterized as " tends to be violent .
we recommend isolation .
so , when did you buy the horse ?
ex cuse me , your honor ,
i don' t understand why the horse is so important .
i' il tell you why .
who are you defending , maggi or the filippucci brothers ?
the filippuccis .
i' ve been hired by the family .
maggi is with carbone , a public defender .
how much did each of you own of the horse ?
that is , what was your share and what was filippucci' s share ?
we each have half .
did you sign any papers to that effect ?
no .
if there were a dispute between the two of you , how could you prove ownership ?
can you tell us where the horse is hidden ?
don' t answer !
the accused doesn' t have to answer that !
who is that ?
who knows ?
maybe the queen .
where are you going ?
hold on .
you can' t go through .
stop !
stop !
you can' t go inside !
a roman emperor
i can' t remember his name called his horse " senator .
man , he speaks good .
why be surprised if two poor boys , two kids living on the street put all their money ... all their hopes on a horse ?
i' ve seen him .
what' s the counselor saying ?
he is talking about the horse .
did you ever ride a horse ?
no , but i' d like to try .
can' t you keep quiet or not ?
who' s talking ?
you don' t need to be a doctor in psychology to understand the overbearing influence that maggi had on his friend , the little innocent giuseppe .
just look at him .
who wouldn' t want him as a son ?
i' m not accusing maggi .
that' s the district attorney' s job .
let' s go .
we' ve got to be brave .
my poor sons !
don' t be like that .
shouldn' t we go back inside ?
no .
who' s saying these innocent boys had a house , a family , school , a job ?
this is not a crime .
should they then be considered criminals ?
if so , ladies and gentlemen , you must condemn all of us , as we are the people who , in pursuit of our passions , abandon the children to fend for themselves .
and our children are alone .
all alone .
mr. cadore , your turn .
i' il be brief , as is my custom .
on the other hand ,
i did not have the time to delve into the details of this case .
therefore , i will entrust my client to the fatherly clemency of the court and i ask for a complete acquittal , or a very light sentence .
very , very light .
marcello !
... in addition , sentence the youth maggi pasquale to two years and six months in prison and a 2 , 000 lira fine , and filippucci giuseppe to one year in prison and a 1 , 000 lira fine .
without appeal .
giuseppe , giuseppe !
you rascals !
you villains !
here they come !
poor boys , my poor sons !
giuseppe !
attilio .
oh , here he is , finally !
we thought they' d put you in front of the firing squad .
how did it go ?
i got a year , but i don' t care .
where is riccardo ?
he' s gone to meet his mother .
she has to give him the money .
then , you' ve changed your mind ? are you crazy ?
this morning , sicilia and i went to the infirmary .
he' s still there and everything' s in place .
i wish i could see the face of the district attorney
when he finds out i' ve escaped !
how much did pasquale get ?
two years .
that much !
and why ?
what happened ?
that stupid woman didn' t come , she sent my father instead .
but  but what ?
we' re escaping anyway , right ?
without money ?
they' d catch us again tomorrow !
what about me ?
they gave me one year , don' t you understand ?
i don' t want to stay here .
i want to get out !
shut up , you idiot !
do you want to ruin everything ?
you' re worried about one year ?
without money there' s no breaking out !
that' s why i asked my mother for 10 , 000 lira , but the stupid woman told my father .
he figured it out , and now he wants to talk to the director .
he' s going to have me put in isolation .
he told me i have to " serve , " i have to pay for it .
damn him !
he says i' m the disgrace of the family .
they' re ashamed of me .
i' ve got money .
where ?
i' ve got it .
how much ?
over 50 , 000 lira .
look , they' re here .
here come the entertainers .
what are you showing tonight ?
something good ? are we going to see naked legs ?
a comedy would be better .
they' re showing a movie .
big deal !
last time they showed something silly
like we were still in kindergarten .
i like it .
i' ve never been to the movies .
so ?
did you have to come to jail for that ?
we' re lucky .
they feed us , they shelter us , give us clothes , they even entertain us .
what else could you want ?
it' s a swell bargain .
news from the free world
in the pacific ocean , general macarthur continues the successful campaign against the japanese .
bougainville is the target of a strong off ensive carried out by the navy and air and ground forces .
the attack is being led by the destroyers .
pasquale the ocean !

what are you doing there ?
damn it , we' ve been caught !

take him back to his cell !
five or six have escaped .
sound the alarm , surround the building .
come on , where is your cell ?
i want to see him .
tomorrow .
we have to wait for the doctor .
what if he' s dead ?
let' s hope not .
now come .
to the cells .
take them to their cells .
i told you to take them to their cells .
arcangeli has escaped .
who' s escaped ?
arcangeli , giuseppe and five others .
really ?
there were more than 20 .
and napoletano is dead .
dead ?
yes , but they caught them .
idiot !
they had a car waiting !
giuseppe had the horse too .
a horse ?
what horse ?
did you hear that ?
they had a horse too .
where did they keep a horse ?
the guards !
stop !
stop there , boys !
come on , we' ve got them
come on , come on !
bartoli , get the forms ready for tomorrow .
and the report .
one page is enough .
tomorrow ?
maybe i won' t be here .
where will you be ?
i don' t think this is the right place for me .
i don' t even know where the right place for me is , but in here you need people tougher than me ... tougher than me .
in any case , there was nothing to be done .
the poor boy his days were numbered .
don biagioni , i' m devastated .
it' s my fault .
it' s my fault .
calm down , calm down .
it was an accident .
we caught them .
there are two missing the criminal arcangeli , and filippucci , the little one who was sentenced this morning .
we informed the police .
they won' t get far .
you don' t believe they could leave town ?
where would they go ?
without money , dressed as inmates , they can' t go around naked in winter .
unless the families help them out , and that' s unlikely .
i know dr. arcangeli and filippucci' s folks are poor .
you can' t imagine the troubles we' il have with the department .
mr. staffera !
what do you want ?
i know where they went .
who ?
arcangeli and giuseppe .
where ?
i' il take you there .
he' s not here .
i knew it .
they took him away .
look over there !
what happened ?
what did they do to you ?
my head hurts .
they beat me up the big one .
where did they go ?
i don' t know .
they came , they wanted the horse .
they said it was theirs .
my head hurts .
they beat me up .
the bigger one ...
get down !
no , no , pasquale , no !
giuseppe ?
giuseppe !
giuseppe ...
giuseppe !
mother of god , what have i done ?
what have i done ?
giuseppe !
the end
