bobby ?
bobby , where are you ?
answer me .
i know you can hear me .
mr. kane ?
mr. kane , do you know where you are ?
do you remember what happened ?
try and follow the light with your eyes .
you' ve had an accident .
you were flying an airplane , and the plane went down .
you' ve been unconscious for quite a long time .
my name is dr. fellows ... ... and i' m here to help you get your life back .
what happened to my family ?
i' m sorry , mr. kane .
kristina !
kristina !
paul kane ?
lawrence augenblick , personal injury solicitor .
i wonder if you could spare me a few ?
do you mind ?
here' s my card .
i know this is no time to be using the " s " word ... ... but you should know the plane you were flying ...
... had parts and maintenance issues .
how did you get in ?
give us a minute .
this is important .
i have to ask you to leave .
don' t be a victim , mr. kane .
make the buggers pay .
i think we did a very nice job , even though i do say so myself .
the door wouldn' t open .
no one' s blaming you .
i don' t remember anything else .
you will .
it will all come back .
they have a haunting fragrance , don' t they ?
i heard about your family .
i thought you might appreciate an american voice .
i just can' t tell you how sorry i am .
thank you .
but , paul , you know , this dr. fellows is not ....
she' s a private contractor , hired from the outside for your rehab ... ... and that means that ... ... your discretion is required .
god , it' s good to see you again , paul .
when was the last time ?
i can' t quite remember .
i remember .
it was paris .
yes , of course , paris .
be careful what you say to dr. fellows , paul .
very good .
your hand eye coordination is improving .
keep this up and you' il be back in the office in no time .
what office ?
it' s a figure of speech .
your file says you work from home , been in the country nearly two years .
some sort of consulting business , i think .
luckily , you don' t need good hand eye coordination for that .
you speak french very well .
well , i studied in switzerland for a year .
yours isn' t bad either .
my mother was french .
that' s all she spoke around the house when i was growing up as a kid .
what else does it say in my file ?
you' re 44 years old , 6 feet tall , 200 pounds , and you have exceptional reflexes .
what does it say in your file ?
that i' m a psychiatrist specializing in trauma .
how did you know i speak french ?
wild guess .
you ready ?
look familiar ?
not really .
don' t worry .
visual memory is only fragments of images at best .
your recovery means stitching them together into something that makes sense .
where are they buried ?
when was the funeral ?
march .
my dad was a flyer , made a career out of the military .
i guess you could say i was an air force brat .
grew up on bases all over the world .
ltaly , germany , lots of different places .
he was shot down over north vietnam .
his body was never recovered .
which one is it ?
it' s that one .
the sign was kristina' s idea .
she wanted it to be just like home .
i' d like to go in alone , if you don' t mind .
this is not going to be easy .
you sure you' re ready ?
thanks for the ride , doctor .
hello , paul .
oh , hello , frank .
i' ve been picking up your mail .
it' s on the table inside .
look , janet and i wanted you to know ... ... well , if there' s anything we can do , please just let us know .
thank you , frank .
i appreciate that .
yes .
who is this ?
kelton reed .
i just wanted to call , see if everything was okay .
everything' s fine .
did you get the personal effects i sent over ?
yes , i did .
i' m sorry , but we didn' t know for sure if you were going to make it .
lf there' s anything missing ....
no .
it looks like it' s all here .
we' il talk soon , then .
good morning , mr. kane .
good morning .
i expect when you got home , a lot of things you' d forgotten came rushing back .
one or two .
it' s not uncommon .
familiar surroundings .
sometime even the most mundane objects can trigger incredibly powerful memories .
memories can be vivid .
a smell , a sound .
paul ?
what were you thinking about ?
oh , nothing .
it was nothing .
i didn' t tell dr. fellows about the gun , of course .
i didn' t tell her about any of it .
my recruitment , my training .
what do you tell her ?
oh , i tell her about bee stings and tree houses , about my first bicycle ... ... about catching frogs in the ditch behind the house i grew up in .
that' s what she wants to hear about most of the time .
what kind of childhood i had , what i remember of it .
does she ask about your work ?
sometimes .
it' s a consulting business .
what' s to know ?
the reason you' re here in london ?
emerging markets .
that' s good .
safe is good .
you are the best , paul , the best we have .
dr. fellows .
mr. kane .
i didn' t hear from you today .
i was concerned .
oh , i apologize .
i meant to call .
i' m not interrupting anything , i hope .
no , no , i was just in the kitchen .
i' m sorry , were you eating ?
i was gonna cook ... ... some pasta .
i eat out .
every night , in fact .
all by yourself ?
mostly , yes .
you don' t like company ?
not particularly .
not unless it has to do with work .
it' s the family house .
it' s not surprising .
when i do think about them ... ... during holiday times , for example , i ....
must be very painful .
well , the strange thing is that i don' t think about them that often .
people cope in different ways .
i know i' m supposed to feel guilty about that , but for some reason i don' t .
and the things i do remember , some details are missing .
for example , i know that i should stop at a red light ... ... but i don' t remember having ever stopped at one before .
it' s the inability to access associative memory .
it' s common with injuries like yours .
thank you .
i hope you like french .
yes , i do .
my mother was french .
yes , i know .
that' s right , you know everything about me , and i know absolutely nothing about you .
what would you like to know ?
what is your first name ?
except that .
that' s the thing i hate most .
why ?
harriet .
that' s bad ?
harriet got five a levels and a double first from cambridge .
it was an anti boy signal , forced me to hit the books .
that' s some name .
ever think of changing it ?
oh , i did .
oh , i gave myself any number of names that i begged them to call me growing up .
lulu , cindy , anastasia .
didn' t matter , the reality of harriet prevailed .
something to drink , sir ?
and what if they had called you lulu or cindy or anastasia ?
who knows ?
you can' t go back and relive your childhood under different circumstances , can you ?
i don' t think i' d want to .
i had a very happy childhood ... ... but it' s an interesting idea .
so after i graduated from cambridge , i started research into
do you ... ?
do you know those two men ?
no , i don' t think i do .
quite a party in prospect .
cocktails for a president in waiting .
thing is , if he does form the next government ... ... we lose all privileges .
what are we gonna do about that ?
relax , already taken care of .
madam , monsieur , everything satisfactory ?
wonderful , thank you .
no , i invited you , remember ?
all right .
lf you' il excuse me just one second .
what' s your name ?
maynard .
are you following me , maynard ?
orders .
kelton reed .
you tell him i' m ready .
ls everything all right ?
everything' s fine .
you mind if i drive ?
i would ask you in , but ....
no , no , no .
i have an early appointment .
well , thanks for dinner .
paul .
it' s so good to see you .
you know , kelton and i , when we lost ben , i didn' t want to live any more .
but you gotta go on .
you know , you' re like a son to him now .
here you go , sweetheart .
now you be real careful .
that' s hot now .
billy , you back again ?
how many of these things you gonna eat ?
honey , look what i' ve got .
paul !
come on , let' s get out of here .
you know , you broke maynard' s nose .
the other guy' s got cracked ribs .
who were those guys ?
local assets .
ex british special forces .
not so special .
so you want to go back to work ?
yeah , i think i do .
hello ?
good morning , doctor .
oh , mr. kane .
i' m sorry to get you so early .
ls this a bad time ?
no , no , it' s fine .
ls there a problem ?
no .
i just wanted to apologize .
i won' t be able to make our next session .
i' m off on a business trip .
a business trip ?
lsn' t it a bit soon ?
well , don' t worry , i' m feeling all right .
where are you going ?
amsterdam .
what' s in amsterdam ?
oh , a couple of meetings .
i see .
you may find that you have difficulty getting on the plane .
i don' t think it will be a problem .
i didn' t want you to be concerned .
i see .
well , have a good trip .
and if you experience any anxieties at all , don' t hesitate to call me anytime .
thank you .
i' il be in touch .
i' m david .
joelle .
give me your hand .
excuse me , my wife  that' s all right .
just go this way .
thank you .
oh , hello .
hello .
lovely meeting you .
nice to see you .
yes .
this is my wife , annette .
excuse me , sir .
i' m so sorry .
please , let me tend to that immediately .
excuse us , please .
here we are , sir .
make a wish , paul , and blow out the candles .
shoot him .
shoot him !
come on !
go !
lbrahim ?
oh , god ! lbrahim ?
oh , god !
i' m sorry .
money , now !
give me your watch .
now , the ring .
what' s the next flight to london ?
sorry , sir , nothing now until tomorrow morning .
shite !
yes ?
i missed the train .
we know .
where are you ?
i' m at the airport .
i don' t know what happened .
it' s all right .
your partner caught it in time .
i guess i wasn' t as ready as i thought .
forget about it .
there' il be other trains .
when are you flying back ?
ln the morning .
i' il be at heathrow at 6 . 40 .
i' il be waiting .
hello ?
hi , it' s paul .
i hope i didn' t wake you .
no , no , no .
i needed to get up anyway .
where are you ?
sounds like you' re on a plane .
yes , i' m flying back this morning .
that was a short trip .
yeah , let me ask you a question .
who is chilly willy ?
chilly willy ?
it' s a cartoon character , i think .
a cartoon character ?
a penguin that' s always cold .
that' s all , nothing else ?
cartoons can be very meaningful .
the joy of childhood ....
paul ?
paul , are you still there ?
yes , yes , i' m here .
paul , are you all right ?
no , no .
come straight here from the airport .
do you still have my address ?
yes .
i need to see you right away .
sir , switch your phone off , please .
i have to go now .
paul ?
excuse me , miss .
what is this video ?
it' s a safety video .
lf you' d like to take your seat please , sir .
fasten your seat belt .
prepare for takeoff .
i need to go aboard .
maybe if you told me what you' re looking for ....
what' s happened ?
paul kane killed three people yesterday .
oh , my god .
we have no motive .
worse , we have no idea of where he is .
do you ?
no .
are you sure ?
he hasn' t contacted you at all ?
he did call me from the plane .
he wanted to come and see me .
what about ?
doctor ?
he wanted to know who chilly willy was .
he remembers .
what size car , sir ?
full size , medium or compact ?
why don' t you just give me any car with four wheels and a full tank of gas .
are you over 25 and with a major credit card ?
he told me he was on a business trip .
why was i not informed of this ?
i have no idea .
i didn' t know anything about it either .
but i' il tell you what we do know .
your instincts about him are wrong .
lnstinct is not the issue .
i keep telling you .
i' m sorry , doctor , but i think it is exactly the issue .
see , i believe in nature .
lf nature selects you to be a cold blooded killer , then that is what you are .
you can' t change that .
that' s a very bleak view of the world .
lf people can' t change , what hope is there ?
it' s been your job to prove me wrong .
i' m still waiting .
something must' ve gone wrong , something we didn' t anticipate .
look , i' m not blaming you .
we both knew what we were dealing with .
what do you want me to do now ?
stay put , hope he makes contact again .
you' re closer to him than anyone .
now , don' t worry .
you' il be under 24 hour surveillance , someone nearby at all times .
they made kane renting a car at the airport .
i' ve gotta go .
right , got it .
just get him before he leaves the airport .
hey , paul , what' s going on ?
frank !
you scared me .
get down .
someone' s broken into my house .
my god , where ?
don' t let them see you .
come on inside , we' il call the police .
no , don' t do that .
not yet .
let' s go inside .
you keep an eye on them .
i' il call the police .
hello ?
yes , this is frank butler , 93 winfield lane .
i' m here with my neighbor .
he says there' s someone breaking into his house .
yes , he' s here with me now .
that' s what i said .
i don' t know .
well , how long do you ?
you know who i am ?
you' re mr. kane .
how do you know that ?
because it says so on the sign in front of your house .
so it does .
hello ?
hello ?
paul , is that you ?
paul , we want to help you .
can you hear me , paul ?
it' s like he' s circling his territory .
we' re not hunting an animal .
lawrence augenblick solicitors .
hi , sonia .
yeah , i know .
it' s really quite
would you mind if i put you on hold ?
okay .
hello , do you have an appointment ?
no .
could you tell mr. augenblick that paul kane is here to ?
thank you for coming in .
we' il set something up for next week .
thanks very much .
bye .
larry , this is mr.  no , don' t tell me .
plane crash , severe head trauma .
mr ....
kane .
paul kane .
mr. kane .
i' m terrible with names , but i never forget an injury .
this is what the newspaper had to say .
according to the official report , that type of plane had six similar episodes recently .
now , i don' t want to count any chickens  i want to show you something .
we' re now going to take you through our safety procedures and equipment .
as this information is for your benefit , we ask that you watch and listen carefully .
the safety card shows details of the ...
mr. kane ? ... oxygen masks and life jackets .
it also shows the bracing position ....
that' s my wife .
oh , right , i' m sorry .
she was a beautiful woman .
she was never a flight attendant .
she was a graphic designer .
down toward the rear of the aircraft ....
something else i wanna show you .
can you read what it says ?
looks like , " chilly willy .
yeah .
chilly willy was a cartoon character , a penguin .
now , you tell me , what' s that doing in my mouth ?
you suffered some pretty severe injuries , mr. kane .
i mean , head injuries .
you were unconscious for a long time .
that woman is my wife .
i' m telling you , literally , there' s something wrong with this picture .
why me ?
why not a private detective or the police if something' s not kosher ?
because i don' t know who i can trust .
i' m just walking out for some cat food .
i' il be back in a minute .
excuse me .
what did they tell you ?
what did they tell you ?
that you murdered three people .
what else ?
they want me to help bring you in .
who wants you to ?
kelton reed ?
don' t lie to me .
i took a big risk following you here .
have you heard from him ?
no , no , i haven' t .
he' il contact you .
be careful .
why ?
watch him .
i know it' s ridiculous , asking you to trust me , but you' re the only one ....
you know everything that i' ve been through .
paul , what happened in amsterdam ?
i can' t tell you that .
bloody hell !
you scared me to death .
how did you get in here ?
you got cheap locks on your door .
i called the airline , tracked down the woman on the video .
she' s not a flight attendant .
what did i tell you ?
she' s an actress .
her name' s amy o' brien .
i spoke to her agent .
they sent me this .
i also found the airfield you flew out of on the day of your crash .
i thought i' d go and see what i can dig up .
i want to see her .
i wouldn' t advise that .
she' s my wife .
mr. kane  paul .
i believe you when you say she' s your wife .
i mean , i believe you believe it .
but we' ve got a good case developing .
let' s not blow it .
she' s my wife .
you think she' s your wife .
that' s why i have to go and find out .
what are you doing ?
what the hell is going on here ?
don' t look so surprised , doctor .
what are you doing with my notes ?
he nearly killed one of my men last night .
you were there .
i don' t need to tell you what happens if that material gets out of our hands .
tell me , how does paul kane know you ?
what did he tell you ?
you don' t work for the justice department , do you ?
no , but i work for a justice department .
you' re gonna kill him , aren' t you ?
what was paul really doing in amsterdam ?
business .
was it business for him to kill a malaysian politician and two of his bodyguards ?
look , this is over .
i' ve always admired you and your work .
we' il take that into consideration when we evaluate your situation later .
blimey !
what happened ?
came down near some trees about three miles over there .
the investigator says it was weather .
what do you say ?
same .
do you always say what they say ?
we' ve been over her from top to bottom .
no defects , nothing .
it' s all in the official report .
weather , eh ?
that' s right .
excuse me .
excuse me , miss .
are you amy ?
i' m sorry .
i don' t ....
you' re an actress , right ?
who are you ?
my name is paul .
i' ve seen some of your work .
i haven' t really done much .
what did you see ?
it was this thing where you were a wife , a mother .
you had ...
... children , two little girls  my god !
you saw that ?
the interactive video thing ?
that was so weird .
you saw it , really ?
where did you see it , in the u. s. ?
yes , that' s right .
they didn' t even send me a copy .
two days in the studio and then , " don' t call us .
since then , it' s been a little here , a little there ... ... but i' m still waiting for my big break .
can i ask you something ?
was i all right ?
i mean , the accent and all .
was i , you know , believable ?
yes .
very .
well , it was very nice to meet you .
they said it was weather related .
the skies were clear that day .
i checked with the forecasts , newspapers .
nothing .
no , i remember the weather .
it was bad .
rainy , very stormy .
that won' t hold up in court .
you can' t remember a thing .
you' re a head case .
sorry .
i don' t know what' s real .
all i' ve got are memories of things that never existed .
like that plane crash .
no , the plane is real .
i saw the plane .
and i saw the girl .
i held her hand .
i looked into her eyes , and she wasn' t real .
all we gotta do is make sense of something that doesn' t make sense .
chilly willy .
what ?
you ever hear of somebody getting a tattoo on the inside of their lip ?
what about it ?
do many people get them there ?
lots of people , in jail or reform school .
it' s an american thing .
catching on over here .
jail , you say ?
yeah .
tats is against the rules .
self mutilation , they call it .
that' s why you put them there .
so nobody knows .
i' ve never been in prison .
that i know .
what , like you knew that actress was really your wife ?
what are you saying ?
i don' t know .
maybe the crash wiped it from your head .
paul , you have told me everything , haven' t you ?
i mean everything ?
yes .
yes .
except ... ... someone is trying to kill me .
actually , a team of men is trying to kill me .
right , and i was gonna invite you to stay at my place .
not exactly the ritz .
my ex wife cleaned me out .
lovely woman .
hey , that swing out there , who does that belong to ?
my son' s .
thanks .
i used to have one of those as a kid .
i' d swing high and bail out like a fighter pilot .
my kid does the same thing .
ls he with his mother ?
yeah , i see him a couple times a month .
how old is he ?
six .
nothing in the world gives you more perspective than having a kid .
oh , i' m sorry .
i didn' t mean to  no , it' s okay .
look , i' ve jabbered on long enough .
you get some sleep , okay ?
you got a lot of troubles , paul , but i' m gonna help you .
promise .
thanks .
there you go .
you okay ?
you were talking in your sleep .
yeah , i' m fine .
you know , i was thinking about what you said about the crash ...
... about me losing those memories .
yeah ?
well , larry , that still doesn' t explain kristina .
i mean , i watched her die .
they took me to her grave .
who did ?
paper for dr. fellows .
slide over .
and please , no penguins .
paul , what happened in amsterdam ?
you mean you really don' t know ?
where reed' s concerned , i know less than you think .
i need to tell you something .
i kill people .
i' m an assassin for the united states government .
i need to tell you something .
no , you' re not .
i was a research fellow at cambridge when they first approached me .
who ?
they said the american justice department .
they wanted to see if a hardened criminal could be rehabilitated ... ... using a technique i' d been developing called clinical memory displacement .
the pilot study needed a particular kind of subject .
he was perfect , a sociopath with a high lq and multiple homicides to his credit .
his name was robert willard .
chilly willy .
let me get this straight , you saying i ain' t gonna have no memory of my life now ?
that' s correct .
that' s wild , man .
that' s wild .
how you gonna do that ?
through a procedure called displacement imprinting .
displacement imprint ?
man , that' s good .
hey .
where was you all 1 0 years ago when i was killing all them people ?
well , maybe it' s best .
do what you want .
kill me .
resurrect me .
i don' t give a damn .
the first thing we did was to stage your execution .
national press coverage .
not even the warden knew .
then , we planted the story about the air crash in all the papers .
we' d already transported you to the lab that we' d set up here in this country .
reed was there representing the u. s. government .
we' re ready , doctor .
let' s party .
my belief was that if we could erase all of your bad memories from 0 to 6 ... ... and replace them with memories of love and support ... ... that we could eliminate willard' s homicidal tendencies .
okay , okay .
make a wish , paul , and blow out your candles .
we matched your new identity with parts of willard' s ... ... an air force father , bases all around the world .
but this time happy , more loving .
when we' d fixed your new personality ... ... we changed your appearance beyond recognition .
how long did all of this take ?
seven months .
we kept you in a controlled coma for seven months .
please , excuse me , sir .
paul ?
i need to know , those people in amsterdam ... ... did you ?
no .
i couldn' t do it .
but amsterdam was not my first mission .
it was the first real one .
you mean that reed ?
hijacked the experiment .
yes .
and implanted another set of memories ... ... memories of being a hired assassin .
german cars .
i never saw anyone die like that , close up .
lf he found us , reed can' t be far behind .
we need to tell someone .
look , it' s me he' s after .
i' il get out at the next train station .
no , don' t do that .
why ?
because i trust you ... ... more than i trust reed .
where are we going ?
somewhere , anywhere they won' t find us .
what is it ?
both kane and willard grew up on bases here , right ?
we matched parts of their biographies , yes .
did young kane spend any time on an air base here ?
ln the u. k. ?
no .
we didn' t create anything like that .
you' re absolutely sure ?
yes .
why ?
because i think bobby willard may have .
there' s more .
we played here when i was a kid .
i left my mark on a tree somewhere over here .
look at that .
it' s impossible .
lmpossible ?
why , because you didn' t put it there ?
because it' s something of my own ?
there was a tin shack right over here somewhere .
watch your step here .
man ....
the old guy that lived here used to let us play out back .
i bet he' s long gone now .
what are you doing ?
it' s 3 . 30 in the morning .
where else are we gonna stay ?
i guess i owe you an apology .
for what ?
for all of this , for them .
lf i hadn' t agreed to do what i did l
i would be dead right now .
i realized that driving over here .
that , in spite of everything that you did to me ... ... if it weren' t for you , i would be dead .
we' re gonna have to tell people , go public .
it' s the only it' s the only way .
what' s gonna happen when people find out that bobby willard is still alive ?
ls he ?
really ?
well , what if reed is right ?
what if nature does win out every time ?
i don' t believe that .
bobby willard cared for nothing and no one .
he was a murderer .
then who is paul kane ?
he' s everything i made him .
he' s everything i wanted him to be .
where was you all 1 0 years ago when i was killing all them people ?
just like a homing pigeon .
let' s keep radio contact to clicks .
and for god' s sake , don' t shoot me .
paul , you okay ?
this place is just as i remember .
well , that must be reassuring .
i mean it' s exactly the same .
thirty four years have gone by and nothing' s changed .
that paint is the same color .
that window was cracked in the same place .
that tree , the shape of those bushes .
that doesn' t seem right .
unless ....
reed .
all right , stay here and try to stay out of sight .
i' m going in .
maynard , cover the front .
ford , take the right .
maynard , you copy that ?
ford ?
you copy that ?
watch yourselves .
there' s nobody home .
maynard ?
ford , you hear me ?
paul ?
i know she' s here , paul .
just want you to know , when i find her , she' s dead .
after what she did to me , that' s okay .
so long as i get you .
you hear that , doctor ?
you must be so proud .
paul ?
you know , paul , your dad used to drive a car just like that .
come on , son .
let' s see what you got .
come on .
don' t forget , i know all your moves .
too bad she gave you a conscience , paul .
you' re an assassin who can' t kill .
now what' s the use of that ?
there .
you see how easy it is ?
paul .
how bad is it ?
try not to move , just lie still .
did you empty the gun ?
i' m so sorry .
last night i just i couldn' t be sure .
what about now ?
then it was worth it .
paul ?
paul !
