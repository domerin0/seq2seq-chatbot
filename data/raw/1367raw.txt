on christmas eve , many years ago ... ...
i lay quietly in my bed .
i did not rustle the sheets .
i breathed slowly and silently .
i was listening for a sound i was afraid i' d never hear .
the ringing bells of santa' s sleigh .
all right .
all right , sarah ... ... you had your water .
now let' s get you upstairs and into bed .
but ...
but ...
but , i have to ...
he said santa would have to fly faster than the speed of light ... ... to get to every house in one night .
and to hold everyone' s presents ... ... his sled would be bigger than an ocean liner .
your brother said that ?
he was just kidding you .
he knows there' s a santa .
he said he wasn' t sure .
he wasn' t sure if santa was for real .
of course santa' s for real .
he' s as real as christmas itself .
but he won' t come ... ... until you' re sound asleep , young lady .
sweet dreams .
santa will be here before you know it .
so go to sleep .
mm hm .
stark , barren .
devoid of life .
he' s gotta be asleep by now .
he used to stay awake all night ... ... waiting for santa .
think those days are just about over .
that would be sad if that were true .
yeah , an end of the magic .
merry christmas , sweetheart .

since you brought him up .
well , i ...
i want to believe .
but ...
but you don' t wanna be bamboozled .
you don' t wanna be led down the primrose path .
you don' t wanna be conned or duped , have the wool pulled over your eyes .
hoodwinked .
you don' t wanna be taken for a ride , railroaded .
seeing is believing .
am i right ?
but what about this train ?
what about it ?
we' re all really going to the north pole ... ... aren' t we ?
aren' t we ?
are you saying that this is all just a dream ?
you said it , kid .
not me .
ah .
so let' s go find that girl .
one other thing .
do you believe in ghosts ?

i have to wake up .
wake up .
wake up .
wake up .
wake up !
wake up , wake up .

kid !

wake up , kid !
there' s no sleepwalking on the polar express .
we gotta jump them knuckles .
come on , kid .
flip my shoulders .
grab my lily .
that skirt you' re chasing must have moved on ahead .
we gotta hightail it to the hog , pronto .
to the hog ?
the engine .
the engine , you tenderfoot .
we gotta make the engine before we hit flat top tunnel .
how come ?
so many questions .
there is but one inch of clearance between the roof of this rattler ... ... and the roof of flat top tunnel .
savvy ?
it' s just the run up to the hump , kid .
this will be interesting .
get back on , kid .
hurry !
grab my muck stick .
there' s only one trick to this , kid .
when i say " jump " ... ... you jump !
ah !
you .
i thought you got thrown off , and ...
you' re driving the train ?
they put me in charge .
the engineer had to check the light .
here' s the light .
careful .
all right , now .
oh !
oh !
i got it .
how do you know how ?
it' s easy .
come here , i' il show you .
this big lever here , that' s the throttle .
this little one here , that' s the brake .
and those are the pressure gauges .
and that rope is the whistle .
the whistle .
mm hm .
you wanna try it ?
i' ve wanted to do that my whole life .
hold still !
hold still !
don' t move !
look !
stop the train !
stop the train !
stop the train !
what ?
they want us to stop the train .
which one is the brake ?
he told me this was .
who ?
the engineer .
the engineer ?
this one looks like a brake .
no , he said this was the brake .
are you sure ?
uh ...
are you sure ?
pull the brake !
stop the train !
caribou ?
ugh .
there' s no christmas ... ... without the polar express arriving on time .
am i the only one who understands that ?
you .
i should have known .
are you bound and determined that this train never reaches the north pole ?
but look .
caribou crossing ? !
i make that herd to be at least 100, 000 , maybe even a million .
it' s gonna be hours before they clear this track .
a tough nut to crack .
we are in some serious jelly .
and a jam .
tight spot .
up a creek .
up a tree .
lost in the grass .
our a ...
ow !
problem solved .
all ahead , slow .
we' re going pretty fast .
tell the engineer to slow down .
slow it down .
watch the speed !
ah !
jumping jeepers , the cotter pin sheared off .
what ?
the pin .
where ?
there .
oh , no .
oh , no .
they can' t hear me .
they can' t ?
oh ...
i don' t like the look of this .
quick , under the safety bar .
is everything all right ?
what should we do ?
considering we' ve lost communication with the engineer ... ... we are standing totally exposed on the front of the locomotive ... ... the train appears to be accelerating uncontrollably ... ... and we are rapidly approaching glacier gulch ... ... which just happens to be the steepest downhill grade in the world ... ... i suggest we all hold on ... ... tightly !
the pin .
the pin .
jiminy christmas , the ice has frozen over the tracks .
hold on .
hold on .
no , no .
come on .
watch your step .
come on , sweetie .
up you go .

l e " ?
hey , just like that know it all kid .
watch your step .
tricky walking up here .
it' s mighty slick .
mighty slick , i tell you .
oh , whoop ...
there you go .
what did i tell you ?
years ago , on my first christmas eve run , i was up on the roof making my rounds ... ... when i slipped on the ice myself .
i reached out for a hand iron , but it broke off .
i slid and fell .
and yet , i did not fall off this train .
someone saved you ?
or something .
an angel .
maybe .
wait .
wait .
what did he look like ?
did you see him ?
no , sir .
but sometimes seeing is believing .
and sometimes the most real things in the world are the things we can' t see .
ah , the forsaken and the abandoned .
mind your step , now .
these poor toys have suffered enough ... ... being left to rust and decay in the back alleys and vacant lots of the world .
what are they doing here ?
it' s a new concept the boss came up with .
instead of being thrown away , they' re collected .
refurbished .
he calls it " rebicycling . " something like that .
makes me wanna cry ... ... seeing toys that were treated this way .
these hopelessly entangled ... ... string puppets and marionettes ... ... pose a particular problem .
we found the nimble fingers of our work force ... ... here at the north pole are best for working out those knots and tangles .
thank you .
uh oh .
double locked here .
you are just like me , my friend .
a scrooge !
ah !
ebenezer scrooge .
north pole , santa claus , this train ... ... it' s all a bunch of humbug .
a bout of indigestion .
oh , yeah .
i know what you are .
you' re a doubter .
a doubter .
you don' t believe !
you' re a doubter !
you don' t believe !
hey , you missed it .
we rode down some really sharp hills .
we were on what looked like a frozen lake .
but i know it was just an optical illusion caused by moonlight .
he said the train was on ice .
but i said that' s impossible ...
you can' t put a train track ...
hey , where you going now ?
shh .
i' m wishing on a star
and trying to believe
that even though it' s far
he' il find me christmas eve
i guess that santa' s busy
' cause he' s never come around
i think of him when christmas comes to town
the best time of the year
when everyone comes home
with all this christmas cheer
it' s hard to be alone
putting up the christmas tree with friends who come around
it' s so much fun when christmas comes to town
presents for the children wrapped in red and green
all the things i' ve heard about but never really seen
no one will be sleeping
on the night of christmas eve
hoping santa' s on his way
when santa' s sleighbells ring
i listen all around
the herald angels sing
i never hear a sound
and all the dreams of children
once lost will all be found
that' s all i want when christmas comes to town
that' s all i want when christmas comes to town
look .
the northern lights .
hey .
you three .
we just crossed it .
latitude 6633 ' .
the arctic circle .
and do you see ?
those lights in the distance .
they look like the lights of a strange ocean liner sailing on a frozen sea .
there ... ... is the north pole .
it' s a magic carpet on a rail it never takes a rest
flying through the mountains and the snow
you can ride for free and join the fun if you just say yes
' cause that' s the way things happen on the polar express
whoo , whoo , the whistle blows that' s the sound of her singing
ding , ding , the bell will ring golly , look at her go
you wonder if you' il get there soon anybody' s guess
' cause that' s the way things happen on the polar express
when we get there we' il scream , " yay !
we' il arrive with a bang , bang , bang
boom , boom , boom laughing all the way
we made it .
with five minutes to spare .
we made it .
there should be elves .
where are the elves ?
yeah , where are the elves ?
they are gathering in the center of the city .
that is where santa will give the first gift of christmas .
who gets the first gift of christmas ?
he will choose one of you .
look .

look , you have to come with us .
she' s right .
christmas just doesn' t work out for me .

but christmas is such a wonderful , beautiful time .
it' s a time for giving and being thankful , for friends and family .
people hang decorations and lights .
santa leaves presents under our christmas trees .
