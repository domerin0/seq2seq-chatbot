at the age of ten ,
l laid my hands on a copy of the legends of the great martyrs .
l read it with a revulsion bordering on voracious ecstasy .
they languished in dungeons , were roasted , pierced with arrows and were nailed to a cross .
all of this they underwent in a state of intoxication .

l live as i paint and write .
l progress no further than an intention , a plan , a first act a first line .

l was twelve when a distant aunt , on my mother' s side came to stay with us .
she was beautiful woman , with a mysterious smile .
but i hated her , because she was known as a femme fatale .
l behaved spitefully and was as antisocial as i could be .
my parents were away on a trip and i was alone with her .
l walked down the stairs and was about to leave , but she stood in front of me , dressed in a fabulous fur coat .
she grabbed me , before i could complain ,
l was lying on the marble floor bound hand and foot .
with an evil grin , she rolled up her sleeves and birched me until i screamed out in pain and begged for mercy .
she released me and i had to get down on my knees and thank her and kiss her hand .
a fierce passion was awakened in me she has been the most attractive woman in the whole world .

do you knowthe story of dionysus' ox ?
it was an iron ox in which someone sentenced to death was placed .
the ox was then put in a huge fire . . the screaming and wailing of the tormented victim in the red hot iron sound like the mooing of an ox .
dionysus smiled nicely at the inventor and immediately had him placed in the iron ox to test his own invention .
