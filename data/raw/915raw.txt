the sweet , uncomplicated satisfaction of the younger woman .
that fleeting age when everything just falls right into place .
it' s magic time , and it can render any man ... ... anywhere , absolutely helpless .
some say i' m an expert on the younger woman .
guess that' s because i' ve been dating them for over 40 years .
so , baby , you' re rich ?
well , my mother is .
sort of .
i mean , not really .
if she lives within a mile of here , she' s rich .
well , i guess a hit play will buy you a house in the hamptons .
i' d like to meet your mother .
no , you wouldn' t .
she' s great .
she' s totally brilliant , but she' s not your type .
you' re overlooking one of the great things about me .
i don' t have a type .
she' s over 30 .
oh , what ?
like you don' t know you have a slight reputation for ...
for ?
for ... ... never dating anyone over 30 .
it just so happens , my dear , that women of a certain age don' t date me .
you ever think of it that way ?
no .
it' s always me .
hey .
i' il call back monday .

how long will it take you to change ?
thirty seconds .

that long ?
oh , har , by the way , no smoking in the house .
my mom doesn' t allow it .
but she allows you to strip in the front yard ?
bring guys you' re dating here to ... ?
she doesn' t know everything i do or when i do it or where i do it .
okay .
the fabulous two story living room ... ... which , i predict , we will spend absolutely no time in whatsoever .
it' s a knockout .
thank you .
i' m very good at giving this tour , by the way , although ... ... l' ve never actually done it while taking off my clothes .
behind me , the requisite hamptons deck ... ... complete with pool and ocean view .
your pants , please .
ladies first .
when i first started auctioneering , someone told me ... ... if i was nervous , i should just picture the audience in their underwear .
this gives that a whole new meaning .
you' re not nervous now , are you ?
i' m always a little nervous .
put on your bathing suit .
i brought us champagne .
i' il put it on ice .
no , i know .
i can' t do anything ...

29 daniels lane , sagaponack ...

yeah , sorry .

no , he' s not a burglar .
he' s dating my daughter .
i had no idea you were coming .
you said you had to write .
i do , but i thought i would do it out here .

harry .
i' m sorry .
i apologize about the near arrest .
you were very impressive .
very strong .

alrighty , then , i' m definitely gonna hit the road .
ladies , sensational meeting you .
doll .

let' s not get so dramatic here .
what are we , four teenagers ?
we' re sophisticated people .
why don' t we all stay .
your mother has work , i have papers to grade .
do your thing , whatever that may be ... ... and if we wanna hang out together , we will .
if we don' t , we don' t .
no reason we should give up this weekend .
seriously .
i can handle it .
i can totally handle it .
i mean , well , i can handle it .
bonjour , madame barry .
bonjour , annie .
impressive .
she took french lessons after she and my dad split up .
part of her " keep busy , don' t look back " program .
now she' s practically fluent .
marin !
okay .
not bad .
well , yeah .
i am fluent .
i' il be right back .
it' s an epidemic .
buy some things .
how about pasta salad ?
we had that last night .
we did ?
i don' t remember .
sure .
why don' t we get a spread and put it on .
oh , sorry .
sorry about that .
my fault .
no .
it' s fine , it' s fine .
so , harry , what do you do ?
i' m an owner of a record company , among other things .
which record company ?
drive by records .
drive by records ?
is that a joke ?
i mean , what is that ?
it' s a hip hop label .
hip hop ?
oh , rap .
right , right .
well , that' s interesting .
let me see if i get where you' re headed here .
i' m sorry , but look , i hate rap .
i do .
i really do .
it' s just crude and violent for my taste ... ... not to mention just a tad misogynistic .
hey , some people see rap as poetry .
yeah , but how many words can you rhyme with " bitch " ?
next , please .
how we doing ?
should have left when she tried to arrest me .
how' s the new play ?
are you getting happy with it ?
you know the thing about me .
i' m 90 percent hard work , 10 percent talent .
and so far , the talent part hasn' t exactly kicked in yet .
right .
right .
what' s your play about ?
about ?
i' m not exactly sure , which is a bit of a problem .
but so far , it' s about a divorced woman , a writer .
she' s a high strung , over amped , controlling , know it all neurotic ... ... who' s incredibly cute and lovable .
it' s a comedy .
so how did you two meet ?
at a wine auction at christie' s .
harry was the big buyer of the night .
i kept raising my paddle just to get her to smile at me .
before i knew it , i bought the entire collection .
every known bottle of chteau margaux .
after that , the least she could do ... ... was share a bottle with me .
ever been married , harry ?
no .
no , i haven' t .
mom .
wow .
now , why do you think that is ?
well , some people just don' t fit the mold , and so far , you know ...
hey , if it ain' t broke ...
exactly .
wait a second .
aren' t you a famous bachelor ?
well , i wouldn' t say i' m famous .
yeah , didn' t i read an article about you in new york magazine ?
i guess some people find it interesting i' ve escaped the noose for so long .
that was the title , " the escape artist .
i read that article .
that was you ?
well , you were once engaged to someone really big .
who was it ?
joan collins ?
no .
no .
okay .
carly simon ?
somebody cool like that .
someone like that .
not martha stewart .
no !
not martha stewart !
you could ask him .
no , this is more fun .
it' s like i' m not here .
harry was once engaged to diane sawyer .
what ?
right .
diane sawyer .
i love her .
i' m impressed .
yeah .
women your age love that about me .
you know what i mean .
yes , i do .
i mean , it' s not a bad thing to say , " women your age .
oh , no .
i' m sure it was a compliment .
it' s just ... ... an accurate observation .
it' s ...
so when was this ?
the engagement ?
long time ago .
she was this adorable , lanky girl from kentucky ... ... with the greatest pair of legs i have ever seen .
never understood her ending up on a job where she never showed them .
you can' t be serious .
i mean , she' s diane sawyer .
she goes into caves in afghanistan ... ... with a shmatte on her head .
who cares about her legs ?
you know what ?
i hate to eat and run , but ...
no !
no , wait .
no .
come on .
this is really fascinating , what' s going on at this table .
zoe teaches women' s studies at columbia .
okay .
so this is gonna hurt .
no .
let' s take you and erica .
zoe ...
you' ve been around the block a few times .
what are you , around 60 ?
sixty three !
fantastic !
never married , which , as we know , if you were a woman , would be a curse .
you' d be an old maid , a spinster .
so instead of pitying you , they write articles about you .
celebrate your never marrying .
you' re elusive and ungetable , a real catch .
then , there' s my gorgeous sister here .
no , wait .
what ... ?
look , please ...
no , this is interesting .
look at her .
she is so accomplished .
most successful female playwright since who ?
lillian hellman ?
she' s over 50 , divorced .
she sits in night after night ... ... because available guys her age want something ...
forgive me , but they want somebody that looks like marin .
the over 50 dating scene is geared towards men leaving older women out .
and as a result , the women become more and more productive ... ... and therefore , more and more interesting .
which , in turn , makes them even less desirable because as we know , men ... ... especially older men , are threatened and afraid ... ... of productive , interesting women .
it is just so clear .
single older women as a demographic are as fucked a group as can exist .
oh , god !
what are you , possessed ?
how could you say those things ?
it seemed really obvious , the injustice .
thank god men die younger than us .
it' s the only break we get .
you know what ?
write a dissertation .
don' t announce that i stay in night after night ...
by the way , one " night after night " would have been enough .
did you ever realize that i stay in as a part of my job ?
and why do you think i married the director of my plays ?
he was the only man i ever saw .
and anyway , i like staying in , and i like this time in my life .
why do i have to defend myself ?
i was married for 20 years .
i' m done .
what the hell was that ?
sorry , i thought i was onto something .
honey , what are you doing with this guy ?
he' s old .
he' s chauvinistic .
he' s fun .
fun ?
i mean , how is he fun ?
he' s , like , wrong .
yeah , wrong can be fun .
no .
not this wrong .
he' s smart and fascinating .
if you talked about something other than marital status ... ... you would find he' s smart , owns 10 different companies .
what does that mean ?
it means he can' t commit .
that' s what it means .
not that i want him to commit .
oh , yeah , that i get .
anyway , he said he thought you two were very spontaneous and nice .
and then he said he' s leaving as soon as the sun comes up .
what , his car doesn' t have headlights ?
wait a minute .
i have no right to get this nuts .
i' m sorry .
he' s your friend , he' s not mine .
i' m sorry and love you .
i love you more .
no chance in hell he said we were nice .
please .
none .
what are they listening to ?
i don' t care .
marvin gaye ?
will you stop that ?
that' s disgusting , zoe .
stop it !
there .
she' il never see him after this weekend .
she can' t commit either .
he does sound fun .
admit it .
he' s got something .
you felt it , right ?
okay , this is nuts .
mom !
did she say , " mom " ?
mom , hurry !
mom !
i don' t know what happened .
we fooled around .
and then he just said he felt funny , and he just collapsed .
harry , what is it ?
i' m okay .
i' m fine .
does your chest hurt ?
it' s like an elephant' s sitting on it .
call 911 , tell them to send an ambulance .
marin , now !
my god !
what are you doing ?
mouth to mouth .
oh , you fucking guy .
we need an ambulance right away , please !
29 daniels lane , sagaponack .

i was kissing a beautiful woman .

unfortunately , no .
sense of humor intact .
yeah .

mr. sanborn ?
yeah .
ekg shows a blocked artery which is not allowing enough ... ... oxygen to get to the heart muscle .
i' m having a heart attack ?
we' re gonna stop it , but i need to know what medications you take .
i take lipitor .
chew this .
anything else ?
and a white one for blood pressure .
and what about viagra ?
mr. sanborn , did you take any viagra today ?
mr. sanborn ?
no .
no viagra .
okay , good , just need to be sure .
because i put nitroglycerin into your drip .
and if you had taken viagra , the combination could be fatal .
your dad' s gonna be okay .
he' s not my dad .
oh , i' m sorry .
your granddad' s gonna be okay .
oh , thank you so much .
we' re not related .
he' s a friend .
sorry .
i' m dr. mercer .
mr. sanborn did have a mild heart attack .
i gave him something to dissolve the clot , and it worked .
he' s very lucky .
another half hour , i don' t ...
i don' t know if this would have worked .
this was very intense .
he' s doing great .
yeah .
i gave him something to help him sleep .
it might make him a little loopy at first but then it should knock him out .
you' re mrs. sanborn ?
no !
oh , no .
no , i' m just ...
no , i' m erica barry .
he had dinner at our house .
i met him this afternoon .

he' s adorable !
mother , i' ve never seen a man less interested in me .
or more interested in you .

no , he' s older than that .
who cares how old he is ?
i mean , he' s not my type .
he' s a gorgeous doctor .
he' s perfect for you .
he' s hot for you .
which makes him really perfect .

i won' t sue you , if that' s what you think .
i' il sign whatever you' d like .

dave .
i' m not putting any pressure on you .
i' m just asking .
dad !
i didn' t know you were here .

i was gonna drive back to the city with zoe , but i' d much rather go with you .
actually , i have someone to meet before i go .
wait .
wait , wait , wait , wait .

zoe' s leaving ?

i' m gonna be stuck with him , alone ?
the hospital' s sending over a nurse in the morning .

i' il just get myself into a zen place .

well , four mai tais at lunch ... ... is a bit much for anybody .
hi .
can i call you right back , doll , huh ?
thank you .
hey .
what' s up ?
okay , here' s the thing .
i don' t want to play the uptight nurse to your bad boy patient .
if you want another heart attack , go ahead .
i have work to do .
i don' t have time to make a run ... ... to the hospital because you' re filling your clogged arteries with smoke .
but more importantly ... ... l' d rather not have my freshly painted house smell like a pool hall .
have you always been like this , or do i bring it out in you ?
just , you know .
i don' t think i' ve ever had this effect on a woman before .
what effect do you think you have on me ?
i don' t quite recognize it .
that' s how i know i never had it before .
so you don' t sleep ?
i only need about four hours a night .
me too .
i never slept eight hours in my life .
me either .
i wish i could .
want me to shut these ?
the sun comes in strong in the morning .
sure .
so , harry ... ... who were you talking to ?
a friend in l. a.
it' s only 10 : 00 on the coast .
that' s not past her bedtime ?
so you don' t get more mellow as the hours pass ?
good night , harry .
can i ask you one other thing ?
what' s with the turtlenecks ?
it' s the middle of summer .
seriously ... ... why do you care what i wear ?
just curious .
i like them .
i' ve always liked them , and i' m just a turtleneck kind of gal .
you never get hot ?
no .
never ?
not lately .
finally .
okay , okay .
holy ... !
oh , god !
oh , i' m sorry .
oh , god , am i sorry .
what are you doing ? !
i was just trying to find the kitchen !
what ?
back here ?
i got confused .
and it was dark and ...
i didn' t really see anything .
just ...
just your tits .
and a little ...
goodbye , mrs. barry .
goodbye ?
you' re leaving ?
oh , no , that' s not good .
been fired .
fired ?
no , you just started .
not fired , darling .
just not needed .
not needed ?
wait , what are you talking about ?
of course she' s needed .
we need her .
oh , no .
i' m actually feeling pretty perky today .
making quite a comeback .
sorry for your trouble , mrs. gimble .
take care , dear .
you' ve been wonderful .
listen ... ... about last night ...
yeah , how about we never talk about that ?
i was at the drugstore .
your prescriptions were ready .
they said to take two with food , this one without .
you were in silhouette .
yeah , i think that' s talking about it .
i didn' t really see all that much .
yep , there you go .
i won' t mention it again , but ...
going to work , harry .
hey .
you saw my ass .
you don' t see me acting nuts ... ... and wearing glasses and hats and weird outfits !
yes or no ?
what' s the deal ?
can i go ?
you still getting dizzy ?
not as much .
out of breath ?
only sometimes .
good .
how' s erica treating you ?
who ?
erica .
oh , her .
she is a major piece of work .
doc , the woman wears turtlenecks in the middle of the summer .
she' s beyond uptight .
almost makes her fun to be around .
uptight ?
that' s funny , i haven' t noticed that .
try living with her .
i actually saw her naked last night .
that doesn' t sound so uptight .
it was an accident .
she thought i was asleep , i thought her room was the kitchen .
you know what freud said , " there are no accidents .
trust me .
this was an accident .
although , why would she walk around naked when she knows i' m nearby ?
why would you think her bedroom was a kitchen ?
it was dark .
it was 2 : 00 in the morning .
that could explain why she was walking around naked .
deep breath .
i' ve never seen a woman that age naked before .
you' re kidding .
hey , we' re not all doctors , baby .
i think she' s very beautiful .
and she' s a fantastic writer , you know .
no , i don' t know .
she' s pretty major .
so you date her daughter ?
okay .
now , she' s a great chick .
must take after her father .
which reminds me .
doc ...
what about mr. midnight , here ?
when can i be up and running in that department ?
i think mr. midnight needs to stay put for another couple of weeks .
but it won' t kill me when i do it , right ?
no , it' s exercise .
it' il be good for you .
if you can climb a flight of stairs , you can have sex .
so you' re saying he can' t travel at all ?
not even by plane ?
so you' re saying he can' t travel at all ?
not even by plane ?
train ?
i don' t think so .
been tough , huh ?
he fired his nurse after an hour , and now says he doesn' t need one .
he' s a bit of a workout .
how are you holding up ?
me ?
you .
well , i' m ...
i' m fine .
fine .
one more " fine " and i won' t believe you .
wait , where' s my ... ?
thank you .
you' re welcome .
hello ?
hi .
i know , i' m sorry .
i haven' t been able to get back .
part of the play takes place in paris ... ... so i keep listening to french music , hoping to get inspired .
well , i' m trying .
it' s not exactly flowing out of me yet , but ...
pick you up around 7 ?
so , what about the patient ?
like he said , he doesn' t need a nurse .
i' m walking around the house !
oh , no .
hi .
listen ... ... l' ve decided to get over the " you saw me naked " thing .
so let' s not deal with it anymore .
good ... ... because i have been hiding from you all day .
do you want to come in ?
i don' t want to break your rhythm or anything .
that would be wishful thinking .
nice painting .
so i' m gonna venture out there and go for a short walk .
you up to that ?
my doctor recommended it .
i gotta build up to climbing stairs and stuff like that .
you wouldn' t want to join me ?
that means you don' t want me to ?
no .
i was asking if you wanted to .
i would , but i don' t like to break once i start writing , so i shouldn' t .
not that a little fresh air would hurt .
it' s just a walk , erica , not a marriage proposal .
you know my name .
erica jane barry .
i looked you up on the internet .
do you know that there are over 8000 websites that mention you ?
that' s not possible .
yeah , it' s true .
i know everything about you now , and not because of last night .
yeah , no , no .
i understood .
actually , i looked you up too .
you did ?
i know you grew up in l. a. , which i thought nobody did .
you started your own record label at 29 , very impressive .
sold it at 40 , even more impressive .
then you started a magazine , dabbled in the internet ... ... and then you invested in a small record company ... ... which you turned into the second largest hip hop label in the world .
it' s exhausting just hearing about it .
yeah , i know .
i know , but ...
the truth is , it goes by fast , doesn' t it ?
like the blink of an eye .
yeah .
look at this .
i notice that you have bowls of those all over your house .
it' s so crazy , i know .
but i just think they' re beautiful .
but why do you only pick up the white ones ?
i don' t pick up only the white ones .
so you really are crazy .
i know .
i only pick up the white ones .
oh , god .
what does that mean ?
that i' m controlling ?
unadventurous ?
what ?
so you' re as hard on yourself as you are on everyone else .
something to remember me by .
can i ask you something , harry ?
yeah , sure .
go ahead , shoot .
what' s with all the young girls ?
what' s the story there ?
really ?
just like to travel light .
you just like to travel ... ?
god !
i' m sorry , but what does that mean ?
now , see , a 30 year old gets that .
you mean , falls for it .
i mean , accepts it .
acceptance is key .
if that' s what you want , a nonthreatening woman ... ... who doesn' t get your number , you get to run the show ...
i think our relationship is growing , by the way .
have you noticed ?
i' m serious .
maybe we just need to get out of the house .
now , you may notice , interestingly , we' re walking back toward the house ... ... and it' s getting a little rocky again .
of course it' s getting rocky .
we' re talking about you .
see , i' il accept that slight hostility ... ... because i' m enjoying your company so much .
are you okay ?
yeah , yeah , but ...
i think i' il stay down here and watch the sun set .
you interested ?
ringside seat .
well ...
big dinner date ?
yeah , as a matter of fact , with your doctor .
my doctor .
wait a minute .
he' s not too young for you ?
he' s totally too young !
but we' re just having dinner , it' s not a date .
does he know that ?
i' m gonna tell him .
but i doubt he thinks of it that way .
i doubt that you doubt it .
anyway , you may like it .
think of it this way .
he' s nonthreatening , won' t get your number , you get to run the show ...
that is so unfair !
trust me .
could be a great night .
look who' s answering the door .
and look who' s at the door .
i brought you something .
a heart healthy dinner from our cafeteria .
why , thank you .
hello .
you look beautiful .
thank you .
hi , it' s marin .
i' m not in , so leave a message and i' il call you back .
it' s me .
just sitting around , looking at your baby pictures .
thinking of you .
this is brooke and shannon .
for brooke , push 1 .
for shannon , push 2 .
everybody is out but old har .
old ... ... old ... ... old ... ... old har .
top of the heap .
julian , can i ask you something ?
anything .
julian , can i ask you something ?
anything .
how old are you ?
i' m 36 .
so i am almost 20 years older than you .
that' s a lot of years to be older than somebody , don' t you think ?
i don' t think it matters at all .
you don' t ?
i don' t .
okay , but ...
but in terms of us , you just ...
you just want us to be friends , right ?
honestly ?
no .
so , what do you want to be ?
i' d embarrass you if i told you .
i was embarrassed just getting dressed to see you .
this may surprise you , but some women consider me quite the guy .
i' ve never been married , i' m a doctor .
you wouldn' t believe what catnip that is for some women .
yes , i would .
it' s just ...
don' t you like girls your own age ?
i do , but i' ve never met one i' ve reacted to ... ... quite like this .
and when something happens to you that' s never happened to you before ... ... don' t you have to find out what it is ?
i don' t know .
this is an area that' s a little tricky for me .
see , i don' t really date all that much or all that well .
come on .
you must beat them away with a stick .
you' re kidding , right ?
no .
no !
men my age , or at least the ones i' ve met , well ...
i' m not that regular of a person , and they really like regular .
men your age may be really stupid .
did you ever think of that ?
yes , i have .
many times .
i knew you' d smell good .
it' s just soap .
erica , you' re incredibly sexy .
no .
swear to god , i' m not .
i' m back !
have fun ?
it was interesting .
good night , harry .
good night .
just get rid of that .
that' s good .
harry37 .
what are you doing ?
harry37 ?
what are you doing ?
writing .
hi .
what are you doing ?
of course .
relentless .
watching joan rivers sell jewelry .
so was your date a date ?
yeah , i think so .
i don' t understand how he knows everything .
i' m in my p. j. s .
in her p. j. s .
pajama party .
oh , man .
we are cute .
this is pretty unusual for me .
i' m not used to having sleepovers .
me either .
really ?
with your social life ?
my dear , you' re confusing sex with sleeping .
sleeping is something that i prefer to do alone .
okay .
good to know .
what are you hungry for ?
what are my choices ?
i mean , i know you think i' m not very discriminating when it comes to ...
oh , please .
what difference does it make what i think of you ?
i can' t even imagine what you think of me .
okay .
pancakes , pasta , leftover coq au vin .
grilled cheese ?
pancakes .
totally what i wanted .
you ever miss being married ?
bet you were great at it .
sometimes .
at night .
but not that much anymore .
was one of us just saying something interesting ?
you said you can' t imagine what i think of you .
you don' t have to answer that .
okay .
i mean , if you had an opinion , i' d be curious .
will you tell me first why you only miss being married at night ?
the phone doesn' t ring that much at night ... ... and the whole alone thing happens at night .
sleeping by myself took getting used to , but i got the hang of it .
you gotta sleep in the middle .
it' s not healthy to have a side when no one has the other side .
now i' m convinced that what i think about you is right .
you' re a tower of strength .
try not to rate my answer .
i' m sorry , okay ?
i' m sorry , but ...
you know what you' re like ?
you' re like one of those great portraits you see over a fireplace .
words have been invented to describe women like you .
such as ?
flinty .
and ... ... impervious .
so you think i' m inhuman ?
no .
i think you' re formidable .
cold , distant , like i' m frozen in some painting ?
not at all .
but i do think you use your strength to separate yourself from everyone .
but it' s thrilling when your defenses are down ... ... and you' re not isolated .
that , i believe , is your winning combo .
killer combo , actually .
you know , i can' t decide if , god , do you hate me ?
or if you' re the only person who ever really got me .
i don' t hate you .
you don' t ?
no .
mom ?
surprise !
well , hi !
room service .
what are you doing here at this hour ?
i had this big benefit .
i went out with friends , then checked my messages ... ... and i got this so sad phone call from harry .
so bored out here , so i figured i should come see how you' re doing .
thank you so much for the gorgeous flowers , by the way .
they' re so huge .
it' s a pleasure .
that is so sweet .
you guys are making pancakes ?
you' re in your p. j. s !
i feel like i' m interrupting !
don' t be silly .
you know i never sleep .
this one doesn' t sleep either .
hello ?
no , i' m here , babe .
i made record time .
is everybody still there ?
okay .
yes .
okay , bye .
since you' re here , why don' t you finish the pancakes and i' il get back to work .
mom , i just got here .
by the way , dad totally stood me up today .
we were supposed to have lunch and he never showed up .
was he always like this ?
i don' t know .
that happens when a couple gets divorced .
the kid inherits all the problems .
not that i' m a kid .
how are you ?
how are you feeling ?
well ...
so tell me .
when can you go home ?
i really am gonna do a little work , so why don' t you just finish this ... ... and you two catch up .
you know how to fix these .
you don' t want pancakes anymore ?
i don' t .
no .
i don' t .
i' m breaking up with harry .
what do you mean ?
why ?
because i met someone else .
in the two days you' ve been gone ?
my life is crazy .
i meet a thousand new people every day .
besides , let' s face it .
he' s insanely too old for me .
i' d be nuts to keep this thing going .
true .
but you know , he' s ...
i know .
he' s soulful when you don' t expect it .
oh , my god .
it' s unnerving !
mom , listen .
i was thinking , if you could handle this , you and harry .
i can' t handle it , wouldn' t want to handle it .
you' re only saying that because you think that he and i have had sex .
lower your voice !
haven' t you ?
never , not even close , i swear to god .
i' m saying this because for two people convinced they' ve got life beat ... ... there was something cooking in the kitchen other than pancakes .
i waited a reasonable amount of hours before calling ... ... even though you' ve been on my mind since i woke up at 5 : 15 .
when could we have dinner again ?
i have to work the next few nights .
if we wait too long , you' il chicken out .
so how' s friday ?
it' s a date night , but that' s a good thing .
who is this ?
i' m kidding .
funny .
can you meet me at the grill at 8 ?
okay .
yes .
seems fine .
i look forward to seeing you too .
he' s all yours .
stop that .
how' d he take it ?
he just took care of it for me .
he was an ace .
elegant .
he said our fate was to be friends .
oh , my god .
he was breaking up with me .
i didn' t even ...
he' s a genius .
that' s not possible .
he wouldn' t .
he absolutely did .
and you know what ?
it doesn' t matter , because we' re done and we both feel fine about it .
okay ?
clean slate .
i gotta go .
okay .
now , erica .
try to think of this ... ... as the absolute smartest thing you' ve ever done for yourself .
candles ?
romantic .
i' m sorry , i ...
for what ?
i just kissed you , and i ...
no , honey .
i kissed you .
i know that one was me .
try not to keep score .
soft lips .
i' m so glad they still work .
i haven' t used them for kissing in such a long time .
more like for , you know , wearing lipstick and whistling and ...
well , well .
now look who' s got something that works .
you didn' t even take any viagra ...
kiss me before you make it go away .
this could be world class interesting .
having any doubts ?
yes .
me too .
but so far ... ... the kissing is spectacular .
i' m not grading you , i' m just mentioning it .
like ...
like , brilliant .
i can' t get past your damn turtleneck .
cut it off .
please .
please !
cut it off .
please .
aren' t you full of surprises ?
yeah .
yeah .
yes .
you' re beautiful .
open your eyes so i know you hear me .
beautiful .
what about birth control ?
menopause .
who' s the lucky boy ?
okay .
okay .
i think we should take your blood pressure .
my blood pressure ?
i think it' s irresponsible not to .
nobody but you would stop ...
yeah , so you' re lucky .
oh , god , i can' t ...
i can' t see .
my glasses .
okay .
120l80 !
oh , baby !
oh , my god .
i do like sex .
you certainly do .
wow !
oh , god .
so this is what you' re supposed to do on a rainy afternoon , huh ?
i really thought i was ... ... sort of closed up for business .
i never expected this .
nothing' s ever surprised me more .
this is crazy .
i can' t remember the last time i cried .
i ...
i think i' m overwhelmed .
me too .
that' s the perfect word .
baby , i had sex three days after a heart attack , and i didn' t die .
that' s gotta be some kind of a record .
yeah .
let' s just not brag about this to your doctor , okay ?
honey .
i may not be many things , but one thing i am is discreet .
yeah .
erica ?
erica .
yeah ?
erica ?
you know i' m not good at being monogamous , right ?
monogamous ?
please .
i hardly know you .
but why paris ?
i just always wanted to write a play that ended there .
people need that romance , and if someone like me doesn' t write it ... ... where will they get it ?
real life ?
excuse me ?
what do you call this ?
eating eggs by candlelight , in our robes ... ... after ...
sorry .
so where do you like to eat in paris ?
i love this bistro called the grand colbert .
it' s behind the palais royal .
it' s the best roast chicken in the universe .
you' d be fun to go to paris with .
it is the best city to stay up all night in .
hey , when is your birthday ?
february .
well , mine' s january .
so how about if we still know each other by then , we go to paris ... ... for our birthdays , huh ?
maybe .
you just said ...
you know something , i have no idea how to do this .
i don' t know how to be intimate but not intimate .
the color is draining from your face .
okay , i' m gonna pee , take one of your blood pressure pills ... ... and when i get back , let' s not talk anymore .
erica .
you' re the funniest girl i ever had sex with .
well , that' s something .
honey .
i think i should go back to my room .
let you get some sleep .
let me sleep ?
yeah .
right .
you usually send the girls home .
but i am home .
okay .
well , i' m an old dog , you know ?
hey .
it' s perfectly ...
whatever .
this was ...
this was ... ... a great night ... ... for me .
me too .
yeah ?
at one point ... ... i even thought ... ... soul mates .
good night .
i' d like to try sleeping with you .
oh , my god !
hi .
what time do you think it is ?
can you see this ?
not really .
it looks like it says ... ... 11 ?
it is 11 .
it is ?
no way .
it can' t be .
oh , my god , that would mean we slept eight hours ?
impossible .
yeah .
oh , nellie .
a little dizzy .
oh , no .
okay , now , you just ...
you just stay still .
there you go .
here' s the clicker .
you have a doctor' s appointment in an hour .
i' il make us some coffee , get you your pills ... ... whip us up some french toast .
i have the best maple syrup ever .
erica .
you are a woman to love .
you are ...
you are a woman to love .
what the hell does that mean ?
okay , buddy , your echo looks real good .
i' m sending you back to the city .
past few days have done wonders for you .
yeah , i' ve been working on that stair thing .
i can do it , by the way .
do what ?
climb a flight of stairs .
several times , actually .
way to go .
so how' s erica ?
erica , as it turns out ... ... is an amazing woman .
she' s just ...
well , that' s wonderful .
i think she' s wonderful .
i think she' s wonderful too .
give her my best .
julian ?
thank you ... ... for everything .
you' re gonna be okay .
i am ?
this is the second time i' ve done this .
i get overcome or something .
it' s so out of the blue .
it' s common to become emotional after having an episode like you had .
everything takes on a new meaning .
so it' s not crazy for a guy to do something ... ... so totally out of character after having a heart attack .
you mean like crying ?
yeah .
and completely changing their taste .
like , suddenly ... ... really liking something that you never thought you could ever like .
ever .
it' s unnerving .
you can expect anything right now .
people have done some wild things after having a heart attack .
but most people go back to being themselves , right ?
i' m gonna go back to being me ... ... aren' t i ?
we' il see .
here you go .
you can have these back now .
i confiscated them on your first night here .
thank you , darling .
try not to smoke them .
and i packed you a sandwich , just in case your blood sugar got low ... ... and some of that iced tea you like , a low cholesterol cookie and a peach .
what a doll .
got something else ?
something to remember me by .
there is that .
and , hey ... ... we' il always have paris .
bad joke .
honey ?
yeah ?
no words can ever express my gratitude ... ... for taking me in ... ... and taking care of me and ...
hey .
your heart attack ... ... could be the best thing that ever happened to me .
i love ya .
i love you too .
if that' s what you said .
i don' t know if it ends in a " ya " if it' s an official " i love you , " but ...
you' re not like anybody .
i knew you' d call .
who ?
it' s me .
what' s wrong ?
had breakfast with dad .
we' re talking , and he starts looking weird and tells me ... ... he met someone three weeks ago , that it' s really something .
and then he ...
he tells me he' s getting married .
why am i reacting this way ?
i' m almost 30 years old .
wait , wait .
who is he marrying ?
i don' t know .
some chick he met three weeks ago .
she' s two years older than me .
she' s an ear , nose and throat doctor .
has he lost his mind ?
honey ...
i have a huge auction tonight ... ... and i' m really upset .
my shrink' s away for two weeks .
can you come in ?
i know you' re working , but just , please ?
i get that he has a right to get remarried , but he doesn' t know her .
she' s my age .
do you know what that' s like ?
that' s , like , beyond creepy .
it' s not like i think he' s replacing me .
i know he isn' t .
i know i' m too old to act like this , it' s nuts .
first of all , please don' t smoke .
if he is replacing anyone , it' s me , not you .
and all the statistics say ... ... divorced men always remarry .
it' s how they' re built .
wanna know why i' m always with the wrong guy ?
this is why .
because the wrong guy can' t do this to you .
this is my big fear , that some guy can get me ... ... unglued like this .
and this is just dad !
we know this about me .
i am just not cut out for this kind of drama .
i think it' s the drama in life that makes you strong .
you always say things to me like this .
you never understand that everyone isn' t like you .
if i were you , and my ex husband , the man i allow to direct my plays ... ... were getting remarried to some 33 year old ... ... ear , nose and throat babe , i' d be bonkers .
and look at you .
you never looked better , by the way .
oh , well ...
marin , we' re all set .
i gotta go sell $40 million worth of art .
can you do one other big thing for me ?
just say yes , just ...
please ?
anything , bubby .
i need you to come out to dinner with me , dad and the fiance .
absolutely not .
no .
mom , you have to .
hey .
you have to .
yes , because he wants me to meet her .
i can' t go alone .
i asked them if you could come , and they said it was fine .
you' re gonna have to meet her too , so we should do it together .
come on .
please ?
you know you can handle it .
well ...
okay , that' s it .
you see that look on your face ?
that' s the gene i didn' t get .
welcome to christie' s and tonight' s sale of impressionist and modern art .
the auctioneer may open bidding on any lot below the reserve ... ... by bidding on behalf of the seller .
let' s start with lot number one ... ... the renard , showing here . $80, 000 is bid with my absent bidder . $85, 000 , gentleman' s bid . $90, 000 , still with me . $ 100, 000 . $ 110, 000 .
$ 140, 000 , gentleman' s bid .
and fair warning .
guess i got stood up .
would you like to order or ... ?
why not ?
i put the tie on and everything .

your drink , ma' am .
oh , good .
thank you so much .
so delicious .
thirsty ?
i' ve had a very big week .
i forgot how these slip right down .
i' m fine .
so , kristen , where did you go to medical ... ... school ?
oh , i' m so sorry .
university of pennsylvania .
well , actually , i went to school in philadelphia too .
bryn mawr girl .
you' re kidding .
my mom went to bryn mawr .
wow !
not only are you marrying my dad , our moms went to the same college .
shall we order ?
absolutely .
erica ?
do i like duck ?
yes , it' s rabbit you hate .
i' il give you a list of his likes and dislikes .
let her figure things out for herself .
i' m not talking about that , dave .
after all , she did go to medical school .
hey , hey , hey .
not in front of the kids .
so , what do you see that you like ?
what are you having ?
i don' t know .
you know , i' m looking at the grilled salmon ...
who would like what ?
mom , are you okay ?
sure you' re okay ?
yeah , no , i' m fine .
i' m ...
i' m fine .
you sure ?
oh , yes .
good .
if we wanted pasta , we could get the fresh rigatoni .
grilled free range chicken teriyaki ...
i' m not sure .
what about you ?
i' m sorry .
maybe i need a little air .
are you okay ?
fine .
i' il be right back .
excuse me .
i' m sorry .
i ...
hey !
hello , harry .
hi .
hi .
i don' t know if you know ...
god , i' m so stupid .
what ?
erica !
harry , i gotta go .
slow down !
you wanna kill me ?
taxi .
erica .
she' s just a friend .
oh , yeah .
she looks like a buddy kind of girl .
come on .
just a dinner .
harry , look .
here' s the problem .
i really like you .
i really like you .
yeah , but i " love you " like you .
i do , i love you .
i think that we should consider ... ... maybe we' re getting ahead of ourselves .
do you ?
yeah .
i am like the dumb girl who doesn' t get it .
i' ve never been the dumb girl before .
it ain' t great .
let' s just calm down .
i had these plans before i even met you .
i mean , i do like seeing you .
i do .
yeah .
i' m always surprised by it .
surprised by it ?
what was i thinking ?
i have never lied to you .
i have always told you some version of the truth .
the truth doesn' t have versions , okay ?
will you cut me a little slack ?
my life has been turned upside down .
mine too !
well , then let' s just each get our bearings .
i don' t want my bearings .
i' ve had my bearings my whole goddamn life .
i felt something with you that i never really knew existed .
do you know what that' s like , after a 20 year marriage ... ... to feel something for another person that is so ... ?
that ...
right .
right .
not your problem .
god .
do you know that i' ve written this , but i never ... ... really got it .
do you know what this is ?
no .
this is heartbroken .
how' s that for impervious ?
you' re killing me .
i just wish that it had lasted more than a week .
me too .
that is a terrible thing to say .
you know , the life i had before you ... ... i knew how to do that .
i could do that forever .
but now look at me .
what am i gonna do ?
what am i gonna do with all this ?
taxi .
erica .
can you wait just a second ?
the truth is , i ...
i just ...
i don' t know how to be a boyfriend .
that' s what you have to say ?
that you don' t know how to be a boyfriend ?
that' s not a small thing .
are we done ?
i don' t know .
oh , my god .
ouch .
oh , my god .
came in via cab .
vital signs are stable .
respiratory is on its way .
chest pain , hospitalized a week ago with an ml .
switch over to monitors .
hang a nitro drip .
you can' t .
i took viagra .
you have been through this before .
let' s run a 12 lead ekg .
you having chest pain right now ?
no .
and the pain i was having was sharp ... ... not like before .
good .
not like before " is what we like to hear .
i was really out of breath ... ... like i couldn' t catch it .
okay .
give him an aspirin , and let' s run a blood gas .
mr. sanborn , what were you doing at the onset of the pain ?
having a fight with someone .
a woman .
can a woman give you chest pains ?
are you kidding ?
love hurts , haven' t you heard ?
i' ve heard .
i just never personally experienced it .
well , you' ve been lucky .
yeah .
lucky .
all right .
your ekg looks perfectly normal .
your heart rate' s good .
the pain you described ... ... is not the kind we worry about .
i think what you experienced was hyperventilation ... ... brought on by stress .
stress ?
and in case you haven' t heard ... ... stress can give you a heart attack .
i have no idea what you' re up to , gallivanting out at this hour ... ... one week after having a heart attack ... ... but if you were my dad , i would have you home in bed ... ... recuperating .
if you were my dad ...
hi , it' s erica .
i' m not here , so leave me a message .
ouch .
you have one new message .
message one .
erica , hi , it' s julian .
i' m in the restaurant ... ... and i' m just wondering if you' re on your way .
it' s about 8 : 20 .
it' s a lovely night out here .
it' s a nice ...
oh , my ...
go figure .
zoe !
hey , mom , we' re going into town .
okay .
are you crying ?
yeah .
it' s my new thing .
i' ve gotten abnormally brilliant at it .
why ?
what is it ?
i' m in love .
ain' t it great ?
seems like i gotta learn how to do that ... ... love them and leave them stuff , you know ?
oh , mom , i hate this .
now do you get my theory about all this ?
you gotta self protect .
you don' t really buy this stuff you say , do you ?
you don' t actually think that you can outsmart getting hurt ?
i think it' s worth trying .
listen to me .
you can' t hide from love for the rest of your life ... ... because maybe it won' t work out ... ... maybe you' il become unglued ?
it' s just not a way to live .
are you telling me this is good ?
i think you should consider the possibility ... ... that you and i are more alike than you realize .
i let someone in , and i had the time of my life .
i' ve never had the time of my life .
i know , baby .
and i say this ... ... from the deepest part of my heart .
what are you waiting for ?
hey !
great party .
thank you .
my pleasure .
hey .
hey , good to see you .
you having fun ?
not quite .
i got you something great at the farm stand .
these are for you to give me when you apologize .
julian , i hope you know how mortified i am by my behavior .
i was gonna get in touch or send a note .
a note ?
a note .
that' s a little chilly .
well ... ... l' m embarrassed .
i just haven' t been myself lately .
what can i say ?
just tell me you' re sorry .
i am sorry .
then you could kiss me .
kiss you ?
you' re gonna forgive me if i kiss you ?
i think so .
no one on earth would forgive you for that kiss .
may i ?
i forgive you .
yes !
it' s the best thing you' ve ever written .
it is ?
it' s wonderful .
it is ?
yes , it' s sweet , it' s smart , it' s funny ...
how great is it for you that i' m not intimidated by your brilliance ?
must we go through this every time ?
come here .
come here .
good .
that' s very good .
anyway , you know what i' m gonna do ?
oh .
oh , my god !
oh , i gotta tell you .
i' m totally excited about this audition .
it' s such a great part .
supporting , but she' s a really funny character .
there' s this totally hilarious scene where she' s dating this older ... ... chauvinistic guy .
just as they' re about to do it , he moans .
and so she' s just thinking that he' s , like , really into her ... ... except he' s having a heart attack .
she' s , like , totally creeped out ... ... and her mom , who basically despises the guy , rushes in ... ... and gives him cpr and saves his life .
are you okay ?
isn' t that funny ?
hold on , hold on .
let' s not get so dramatic here .
hold on , hold on .
let' s not get so dramatic here .
what are we , four teenagers ?
we' re all sophisticated people .
why can' t we all stay for the weekend ?
your mother has work to do , i' ve got papers to grade .
you do what you' re going to do , whatever that might be ...
i need to talk to you . together , and if we don' t , we don' t .
got a minute ?
so your play is about us ?
no , it' s about me .
am i in it ?
well , a guy like you is in it , but he' s not you .
what happens to this guy who' s not me ?
i haven' t totally decided .
he can ...
he can live , or he can die .
what are you leaning towards ?
death .
it' s funnier .
fine .
he dies of a funny heart attack .
he' s a schmuck , who screwed around with our heroine , so it won' t be sad .
schmucks are people too , you know ?
death doesn' t seem a little harsh to you ?
i went where the story took me .
it' s a work of fiction , stuff that i made up .
they' re ready to do the hospital " do you take viagra ? " scene .
should we wait for you ?
yeah .
that' s good .
that' s fine .
so i' m gonna be the laughing stock of broadway ?
harry , he' s not you .
he' s a version of the truth of you , so to speak .
dave wants to know when henry says , " i love ya " ... ... you want that to be " ya , " not " you , " right ?
right .
well , you look really nice .
thank you .
are you feeling all right ?
you know ... ... it isn' t like i wanted to stop seeing you .
we could' ve carried on a fun thing for a while .
why is it that you broads want all or nothing ?
i don' t know .
we' re just goofy when it comes to love .
harry , if it' s all right with you ... ... l' d like to be friends .
i' m not ready to be your friend .
how' s that ?
fine .
i understand .
anyway , do you actually buy that horseshit ?
that men and women can be friends once they' ve had sex ?
i' m friends with my ex husband , but we didn' t just have sex .
we didn' t just have sex either .
then what was it ?
i' d love to know .
can i e mail it to you when i figure it out ?
okay .
okay .
just moving into another phase with this thing .
i' m mad at you .
i think i' m mad at you too .
excellent !
because i don' t like thinking about you so much ... ... and worrying about how you are and if i ruined your life .
you' ve worried about me ?
yes , honey .
the schmuck ... ... who deserves to die ... ... worries about you .
sometimes worrying about you feels like a full time job .
well , doll , i' m doing great .
so you don' t have to work that shift anymore .
erica ?
they want you to look at the costumes for the dancing henrys .
are these gonna work for you ?
mr. sanborn , back so soon ?
this is it , i' m dying .
i' ve had 20 minutes of severe chest pains , nausea , shortness of breath ... ... my blood pressure' s gotta be 170l100 .
give me the nitro , i didn' t take viagra .
plug me into an ekg .
i' m taking two beta blockers ... ... blood thinners , lipitor , procardia .
if i were you , i' d pound on my chest .
mr. sanborn .
your diagnosis , although fascinating , was entirely incorrect .
impossible !
do you realize ... ... that a severe anxiety attack can masquerade as a heart attack ?
so i' m nuts .
perfect .
the one thing i' m not taking pills for .
if you don' t wanna be here every week ... ... i suggest you do whatever it takes to decompress .
now lie down .
just try something with me .
come on .
give me your hand .
relax , relax .
all right , close your eyes .
okay , good .
i want you to give yourself a visual ...
both eyes .
i want you to give yourself a visual image ... ... of something that gives you a feeling of peace and serenity .
i don' t know .
what ?
a hammock .
good .
what else ?
palm trees .
clear , blue water .
what else do you see ?
feel ?
taste ?
a peach margarita .
a cuban cigar .
miles ... ... of soft beach .
i couldn' t believe you were calling from downstairs .
you have a beard !
it' s great to see you .
you couldn' t look better .
thank you .
well , come on in .
no , no .
i just wanted to stop by and say hi ... ... and tell you i' m sorry if i ever did anything that wasn' t on the up and up .
what do you mean ?
you were great to me .
i was ?
always .
that' s refreshing .
good .
well , i don' t know what you' ve done to yourself ... ... but you look absolutely radiant .
i' m three months pregnant .
that might have something to do with it .
really ?
yeah .
who' s the lucky guy ?
my husband .
hold on because he really wants to meet you .
danny .
harry sanborn , this is my husband , danny benjamin .
heard so much about you .
i bet .
well , you know , with the play and all .
i' m famous , huh ?
hey , just to us .
in every interview my mom does , she always says she made you up .
so the guy in the play doesn' t make it , does he ?
he basically dies at the end of the second act .
but it gets a huge laugh .
i was hoping she' d give me a reprieve .
yeah , well ...
okay .
good seeing you .
congratulations .
thanks .
how is she ?
she' s really good .
up to her old tricks .
learning italian , remodeling her apartment in the city ...
now , if i wanted to see her , how would that go over ?
only one way to find out .
except she' s out of town right now .
oh , yeah ?
where is she ?
paris .
she left two days ago for her birthday .
but she' il be back next week .
paris .
showtime .
i knew you' d be here .
you did ?
at first i thought i had the wrong restaurant , but here you are .
just like i imagined .
you mean ... ... we' re not bumping into each other ?
you came here to see me ?
i' m aware it was a bold move ... ... one of those impulses that grabs you , but so far we' re okay .
right ?
i mean ...
i kind of ...
it would be great ... ... if you' d let me take that as a yes .
would you like a glass of wine ?
yeah .
i would .
i would love one .
i was just gonna give you a kiss hello .
okay .
whoa .
awkward .
you remember how you said if we still knew each other ... ... we should go to paris for our birthdays ?
well , we still know each other .
that' s true .
but , harry , i haven' t heard from you in six months .
yeah .
after i saw you in the theater , with the dancing henrys ...
yes .
sorry ...
no , it' s very funny , by the way .
i had another episode .
oh , i' m sorry .
well , as it turned out , i was fine ... ... but i was sure i was dying , and the doctor in the er said i needed ... ... to decompress .
so i did .
i walked out of there and changed my life .
sold most of my businesses , packed my bags ... ... moved to an island in the caribbean .
that is where you' ve been all this time ?
the caribbean ?
actually , no .
i was there about six hours ... ... when it occurred to me that wasting away on an island ... ... couldn' t possibly cure what was ailing me .
so i decided to take another kind of trip ... ... into , let' s call it , my past .
your past ?
i thought if i visited some of the women i' ve known ... ... that maybe i could figure out how i arrived at being me .
wow .
wow , yeah , it was quite a journey .
hi , louise .
remember me ?
hi , how are ... ?
some of the ladies , i admit , weren' t too interested in seeing me ... ... or even speaking to me , but one day , my losing streak ended .
one of them opened up to me .
hearing what she had to say was no picnic , but i stuck it out and i listened .
and then i listened harder .
and one of the things i realized ... ... was i was actually giving closure to generations of women .
when you hear the same story about yourself ... ... over and over , your life begins to add up .
took me months to find them all .
visited a dozen different states .
but i traveled the farthest to see you .
i don' t believe it .
me either .
doc .
how are you ?
i' m good .
nice to see you .
you too .
i should have told you he was coming ... ... but i was so engrossed in your story .
i just ...
sorry i' m late .
what story ?
oh , maybe another time .
so i guess i should' ve seen your play .
would' ve known how this ended .
yeah .
yeah , big twist , huh ?
yeah .
so , what are you doing over here , man ?
just a vacation .
i' ve never been to paris in january .
it' s amazing to run into you .
you look good .
you look great .
i haven' t been on a gurney ... ... in six months , so that' s something .
well , i' ve just been to every store in the city .
what ?
this woman' s impossible to buy for ... ... but i think i finally found the right gift .
happy birthday , baby .
i' il open it in a bit .
no , no , no , no .
you know what ?
i' m gonna let you two celebrate .
harry , no , please .
stay .
join us for dinner .
we' d love to ...
i can' t .
i can' t .
really .
why ?
you have somewhere to go ?
i' ve spent a lot of time in hospitals .
it doesn' t matter , right ?
went to see a ...
what was it ?
no , it was a wheaten terrier .
so beautiful .
so beautiful .
make a wish .
to the forces of destiny that brought us together .
forces of destiny .
beautiful .
you don' t smoke .
i' m in paris .
secondhand smoke will kill you anyway .
she' s very brilliant , but the woman cannot hold her liquor .
i like that about me .
me too .
an awkward moment .
honey , if you were writing this , i' d be dead .
never fails to amuse her .
no .
let us .
oh , no .
please , let us .
doc , i insist .
i crashed your party .
no .
let me buy you dinner ... ... on your birthday .
thank you .
what time does that say ?
oh , god , i have no idea .
oh , wait a minute , i ...
me too .
me too .
you think you look so handsome in mine ?
you know how long i have been looking for those ?
yes , i do .
thank you very much .
excuse me .
thank you .
once again , closure .
well , here we are .
harry , why don' t you take it .
no , no .
i think i' m gonna walk .
you two take it .
well .
harry .
doc .
thanks for everything .
stay well .
well , this was fun .
and it was so great to see you .
honest .
so ...
it was great to see you .
look ... ... erica , if you ever ...
no .
take care of yourself , harry .
yeah , i will .
you too .
it' s cold , huh ?
look who gets to be the girl .
anything else ?
where' s julian ?
he' s back at the hotel .
he said when he saw me with you ... ... he knew that i was still in love with you .
what do you have to say about that ?
if it' s true , my life just got made .
why' d you come here , harry ?
turns out the heart attack was easy to get over .
you ... ... were something else .
i finally get what it' s all about .
i' m 63 years old , and i' m in love ... ... for the first time in my life .
that' s what i came here to say .
harry .
sanborn .
mr. sanborn .
four and a half .
got your table waiting .
