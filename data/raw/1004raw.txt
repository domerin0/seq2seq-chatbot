ted !
i came home early and found your note .
i guess you meant for me to read it later .
i' ve got to talk to you .
i don' t want to go over it any more .
things haven' t been right for a long time , but it' il be different , like in the beginning .
just be patient and i' il work things out .
i have been patient and i' ve tried to help , but you wouldn' t even let me do that .
don' t you feel anything for me any more ?
it takes so many things to make love last .
most of all , it takes respect .
i can' t live with a man i don' t respect !
what a pisser .
captain oveur , white courtesy phone .
captain clarence oveur , white courtesy phone .
no , the white phone !
this is captain oveur .
one moment for your call from the mayo clinic .
captain oveur , white courtesy phone .
i' ve got it !
thank you .
go ahead with your call .
this is dr brody at the mayo clinic .
there' s a passenger on your chicago flight , a little girl named lisa davis , en route to minneapolis .
she' s scheduled for a heart transplant .
tell her mother we found a donor .
the heart is ready for surgery .
we must have the recipient on the operating table within six hours .
make sure she' s kept in a reclined position , that a continuous watch is kept on her iv .
it' s very important she remain calm ...
excuse me , this is the operator .
i have an emergency call on line five from mr hamm .
give me hamm on five , hold the mayo .
you' il be back tomorrow night .
we' il have dinner .
we' il talk things over .
i won' t be back .
i' ve requested the atlanta run .
elaine ... l promise i can change .
then why didn' t you take the job that louie netz offered you at boeing ?
i haven' t been able to get near a plane since the war .
and they wouldn' t hire me because of my war record .
war record ?
you' re the only one keeping that alive .
for everyone else , it' s ancient history .
you expect me to believe that ?
it' s the truth .
what' s hurt you the most is your record since the war different cities , different jobs and not one of them shows you can accept any real responsibility .
elaine , just give me one more ...
it' s too late , ted .
when i get back to chicago ,
i' m going to start my life all over again .
i' m sorry .
excuse me , take this flower from the church of religious ...
hi !
well , good evening .
there you go .
just follow them to the back .
any word on that storm lifting over salt lake , clarence ?
no , not likely , victor .
i just reviewed the area report for 1600 hours through 2400 .
there' s an occluded front stalled over the dakotas , backed up all the way to utah .
if she decides to push over the great lakes , it could get plenty soupy .
what about that southern route around tulsa ?
i double checked the terminal forecast , and the wind' s aloft and ifr ceilings all the way .
where do they top out ?
light scattered cover at 20, 000 , icing around 18 .
looks like over denver is best .
denver it is .
sorry , clarence .
latest report shows everything' s socked in from salt lake to lincoln .
hi , roger .
glad to have you aboard .
victor , this is roger murdock .
victor basta .
how do you do ?
nice to meet you .
i was telling victor i reviewed the area report for 1600 hours through 2400 .
there' s an occluded front stalled over the dakotas .
there you go .
thank you .

the whole flight crew has boarded .

striker , this is red leader four .
primary target covered by fog .
decision to proceed is yours .
the decision is yours ... is yours ... is yours ...
golly , that white fellow should stay away from my wife , or i will punch him .
yes , he is wrong for doing that .
i knew a man in a similar predicament , and he ended up being sorry .
don' t be naive , arthur .
each of us faces a clear moral choice .
early to bed , early to rise makes a man healthy , wealthy and wise .
how true !
golly !
nervous ?
yes .
first time ?
no .
i' ve been nervous lots of times .
hi .
we' il be taking off real soon , so i better fasten you in tight .
thank you .
oh , mother , this is so exciting !
i know , but remember , you must get some rest .
that' s good advice .
you relax , and i' il be back after takeoff .
thank you .
i' m going to miss you so much .
i' m going to miss you , too .

oh , i haven' t flown for a long time .
good evening .
this is captain oveur speaking .
we' il be cruising at 36, 000 feet this evening ...
relax and enjoy your flight .
would you like something to read ?
do you have anything light ?
how about this leaflet , " famous jewish sports legends " ?
yes .
thank you .
ted !
what are you doing here ?
i' ve got to talk to you .
you shouldn' t have come .
i don' t have time now .
stewardess ?
excuse me .
but ...
no wonder you' re upset .
she' s lovely .
and a darling figure .
supple , pouting breasts , firm thighs .
it' s a shame you two don' t get along .
yes , i know .
things used to be different .
i remember when we first met .
it was during the war .
i was in the air force , stationed in drambuie , off the barbary coast .
i used to hang out at the magumba bar .
it was a rough place .
the seediest dive on the wharf , populated with every reject and cut throat from bombay to calcutta .
it was worse than detroit .
the mood in the place was ugly .
you wouldn' t be there unless you knew how to use your fists .
a fight broke out almost every night .
i didn' t go there that night to fall in love .
i just wanted a couple of drinks .
and suddenly , there she was .
i was captivated , entranced .
it hit me like a thunderbolt .
i had to asked this guy to pinch me to make sure i wasn' t dreaming .
i was afraid to approach her , but that night , fate was on my side .
we laughed , we talked , we danced .
i never wanted it to end .
i guess i still don' t .
enough about me .
i hope this hasn' t been boring for you .
whenever i talk about elaine , i get carried away .
i lose all track of time .
would you like to order dinner ?
joey will have steak .
we' il have fish .
when can i see the cockpit ?
the pilots are probably too busy flying the plane for that .
aw , gee whizz !
i' il talk to the captain and see what i can arrange .
gee , that' d be swell !
would you care to order your dinners ?
i would like the steak , please .
i' il have the fish .
excuse me , i happened to be passing .
i thought you might like some coffee .
that' s very nice of you .
thank you .
won' t you sit down ?
thank you .
cream ?
no , i take it black .
like my men .
ted , i never knew i could be so happy .
these past few months have been wonderful .
tomorrow , why don' t we drive to that little seafood place and ...
what' s the matter ?
my orders came through .
my squadron ships out tomorrow .
we' re bombing the storage depots at daiquiri at 1800 hours .
we' re coming in from the north , below their radar .
when will you be back ?
i can' t tell you that .
it' s classified .
oh , ted , please be careful .
i worry about you so much .
i love you , elaine .
i love you .
flight 209er , this is denver flight control .
you' re approaching rough weather .
please climb to 42, 000 feet .
roger , denver .
we have a visitor .
hello .
captain oveur , mr murdock , and mr basta , this is joey hammen .
hi , joey .
come up here .
this is for special visitors .
would you like to have it ?
thank you .
thanks a lot .
sure .
ever been in a cockpit ?
no , i' ve never been up in a plane before .
have you ever seen a grown man naked ?
shall i check the weather ?
no , why don' t you take care of it ?
joey , do you ever hang around a gymnasium ?
we' d better get back .
no , joey can stay for a while .
could l ?
ok , if you don' t get in the way .
flight 209er to denver , climbing to cruise at 42, 000 .
will report again over lincoln .
over and out .
wait a minute , i know you .
you' re kareem abdul jabbar .
you play basketball for the los angeles lakers .
sorry , you have me confused with someone else .
my name' s roger murdock .
i' m the co pilot .
you are kareem !
i' ve seen you play .
my dad' s got season tickets .
you should go back to your seat now .
right , clarence ?
no , he' s not bothering anyone .
let him stay here .
all right , but just remember my name is roger murdock .
i' m an airline pilot .
i think you' re the greatest , but my dad says you don' t work hard enough on defence .
and he says lots of times you don' t even run downcourt .
and you don' t try , except during play offs .
the hell i don' t !
listen , kid , i' ve been hearing that crap ever since i was at ucla .
i' m out there busting my buns every night .
tell your old man to drag walton and lanier up and down the court for 48 minutes .
joey ...
do you like movies about gladiators ?
elaine , just hear me out .
things haven' t been right for a long time , but it' il be different , like in the beginning , remember ?
i remember everything .
all i have is memories .
mostly , i remember the nights we were together .
i remember how you used to hold me , and how i used to sit on your face and wriggle , and ... afterwards , how we' d watch till the sun came up .
when it did , it was almost like ...
iike each new day was created only for us .
that' s the way i' ve always wanted it to be .
but it won' t be .
not as long as you insist on living in the past !
you' re too low , ted !
you' re too low !
the mind plays tricks on you .
he looks so happy today , doesn' t he ?
you look so happy today .
ok , robert , slip them down .
this won' t hurt much .
you got a telegram from headquarters today .
headquarters ?
what is it ?
a big building where generals meet , but that' s not important .
they' ve cleared you of any blame for what happened on that raid .
isn' t that good news ?
is it ?
because of my mistake , six men didn' t return from that raid .
seven .
lieutenant zip died this morning .
but dr sandler says you' il be out in a week .
isn' t that wonderful ?
i wish i could say the same for george zip .
be patient , ted .
nobody expects you to get over this immediately .
hey , striker , how about a break ?
i' m getting tired .
yeah , all right .
take five .
thanks .
i found a wonderful apartment for us .
it has a brick fireplace and a cute bedroom with mirrors on the ceiling and ...
red leader !
red leader , i' m going down !
captain geline .
he think he' s a pilot , still fighting the war .
i' ve found the tunnel , johnson !
it' s this way ! $25 for a cigarette is too much !
what' s his problem ?
it' s lieutenant hurwitz .
severe shell shock .
he thinks he' s ethel merman .
war is hell .
excuse me , sir .
would you like coffee before dinner ?
no .
no , thank you .
would you like another cup ?
i will , but jim won' t .
i think i will have another cup of coffee .
jim never has a second cup of coffee at home .
excuse me , sister .
yes ?
there' s a little girl onboard who' s ill .
oh , yes , i saw .
poor child .
could i borrow your guitar ?
i thought maybe i could cheer her up .
of course .
thank you .
hi .
hi .
do you mind if i talk to your daughter ?
i think that' d would be nice .
hi , i' m randy .
i' m lisa .
oh , you have a guitar !
i thought maybe you' d like to hear a song .
i' d love to .
ok .
let' s see ...
this is one of my favorites .
you' re late .
we' ve been waiting .
who' s first ?
go ahead , clarence .
how' s the weather ?
we got some heavy stuff ahead .
we' ve got to climb on top .
yeah , after the war , i wanted to get as far away as possible , so elaine and i joined the peace corps .
we were assigned to an isolated tribe , the molombos .
they' d never seen americans before .
it was really a challenge , introducing them to our western culture .
at first , they didn' t know what to think of us .
but soon , we gained their trust .
it' il help you better prepare storing foods for the up and coming monsoon months .
also , supperware products are ideal for storing leftovers to help stretch your food dollar .
this two quart " seals m rite " container keeps hot dog buns fresh for days .
these people had been completely isolated from civilization .
no one had outlined a physical fitness program for them , and they had no athletic equipment .
i started them on simple calisthenics , worked up to rudimentary game skills , and finally , advanced competitive theory .
i was patient , and they were eager to learn .
they seemed to enjoy themselves .
probably due to advanced american teaching techniques , we bridged the generations of isolation , and communicated successfully with the molombos .
they' re getting the hang of it .
when we re enlist , i' il teach them baseball .
ted , i don' t want to stay here .
it' s time to go home to the plans we made before the war .
a lot of people made plans before the war .
like george zip .
at that moment , i realised elaine had doubts about our relationship .
and that , as much as anything else , led to my drinking problem .
we did come back to the states .
i tried a number of jobs .
i could go on , but i' d probably bore you .
i couldn' t blame elaine .
she wanted a career .
i can' t stand it .
what is it ?
yes ?
it' s my stomach .
i haven' t felt this awful since we saw that ronald reagan film .
i' il see if i can find some dramamine .
captain , a woman passenger is very sick .
airsick ?
i think so , but i' ve never seen it so acute .
find out if a doctor' s onboard as quietly as you can .
joey , have you ever been in a turkish prison ?
i shouldn' t have had that second cup of coffee .
jim never vomits at home .
sorry to wake you .
i' m looking for a doctor .
there' s nothing to worry about .
stewardess , i think the man next to me is a doctor .
sir , excuse me .
sorry to wake you , are you a doctor ?
that' s right .
we have sick passengers .
could you come look at them ?
yes .
yes , of course .
let me see your tongue .
i' il be back in a minute .
tell the captain to land .
she must go to a hospital .
a hospital !
what is it ?
it' s a big building with patients , but that' s not important .
i must speak to the captain .
certainly .
victor , we' re running into heavy ...
roger , take over !
captain , how soon can you land ?
i can' t tell .
you can tell me .
i' m a doctor .
no , i' m not sure .
can' t you take a guess ?
not for another two hours .
you can' t take a guess for another two hours ?
no , we can' t land .
fog has closed down everything .
we' ve got to get through to chicago .
get him out of there !
what is it , doctor ?
what' s going on ?
i' m not sure .
haven' t seen anything like this since the anita bryant concert .
what did we have for dinner ?
we had a choice steak or fish .
yes , i remember .
i had lasagna .
what did he have ?
he had fish .
doctor , two more are sick .
the other passengers are worried .
we' il handle the passengers .
find out what the sick people had for dinner .
this is captain oveur speaking .
it' s bumpy , but we' il be past it in a few minutes .
we' re now flying over hoover dam , and later we' il pass south of the grand canyon .
meanwhile , relax and enjoy your flight , ok ?
chicago , this is flight 209er .
we' re in trouble .
we need traffic below us cleared and priority landing in chicago .
yes ?
my husband' s very sick .
can you do something ?
the doctor will be with you in just a moment .
do you know what he had for dinner ?
yes , we both had fish .
why ?
it' s nothing to be alarmed about .
we' il be back to you very quickly .
doctor , mr hammen ate fish , and randy said there are five more cases , and they all had fish .
the co pilot had fish .
what did the navigator have ?
he had fish .
all right , now we know what we' re up against .
those who had fish for dinner will soon become violently ill .
just how serious is it ?
extremely serious .
it starts with a slight fever , dryness of the throat .
when the virus penetrates , the victim becomes dizzy , and begins to experience an itching rash .
from there , the poison works on the central nervous system , causing severe muscle spasms , followed by the inevitable drooling .
at this point , the digestive system collapses , accompanied by uncontrollable flatulence .
until , finally , the poor bastard is reduced to a quivering , wasted piece of jelly .
put it on ... automatic pilot .
automatic pilot , automatic pilot ...
there it is !
i' il go back to the passengers .
come in , 209er .
this is chicago .
flight 209er , come in .
this is elaine dickinson , the stewardess .
captain oveur' s passed out .
we' ve lost the co pilot and navigator , too .
we' re in trouble .
roger .
i' m steve mccroskey , chicago air control .
i' il be back in a moment .
hold all takeoffs .
when 508 reports , bring it straight in .
suspend all meal service on flights leaving los angeles .
tell all dispatchers to remain at the post .
how about coffee ?
no , thanks .
i want the weather on every available landing field .
you understand ?
any place available to land that plane !
go to the tower and get a runway diagram .
check down the field for emergency equipment .
chief , we got fog every place east of the rockies .
they' il have to come through to chicago .
looks like i picked the wrong week to quit smoking .
get the best available man who won' t crack under pressure .
how about mr rogers ?
get me rex kramer .
next to the throttle is the air speed gauge .
what speed does it indicate ?
520 miles per hour .
good .
very good .
now , check your altitude .
that' s the dial below and right of the speed indicator .
35, 000 feet .
no , wait .
34, 000 feet .
no .
it' s dropping !
it' s dropping fast !
why is it doing that ?
oh , my god !
the automatic pilot , it' s deflating !
elaine , don' t panic .
on his belt line there' s a hollow tube .
that' s the manual inflation nozzle .
pull it out and blow on it .
what the hell' s going on up there ?
elaine .
yes , doctor ?
elaine , you' re a member of this crew .
can you face some unpleasant facts ?
no .
unless we hospitalise those people quickly ,
i can' t be sure of saving their lives .
is there anyone on board who can land this plane ?
well ...
no .
no one i know of .
you ought to know our chances .
our lives depend on just one thing finding someone to fly this plane who didn' t have fish for dinner .
ladies and gentlemen , this is your stewardess speaking .
we regret any inconvenience the sudden cabin movement caused .
this is due to periodic air pockets .
there' s no reason to become alarmed .
we hope you enjoy your flight .
by the way , is there anyone on board who can fly a plane ?
hello .
i' m paul carey from the airline .
i' m here to pick up captain kramer .
yes .
come in , paul .
rex will be right out .
shep , sit .
sit !
i understand there' s an emergency .
something like that .
there wasn' t time to tell me very much ...
shep , no !
i' il bet exciting things happen all the time down there .
airline business does have its moments .
after a while , you get used to it .
shep !
come !
he gets so excited when new people are here .
are you a pilot ?
no , i' m in ... a training program .
it' s unbelievable .
it' s just unbelievable .
how many times have i warned about food inspection ?
you' d think someone would listen to you .
well , airport management , the faa , and the airlines ... they' re all cheats and liars .
all right .
let' s get out of here .
i' m sorry , i was just looking for someone with flying experience .
when they built those roads , they didn' t think about drainage , so we had to take a special jeep up to the main road .
we were lucky to get a jeep , since , just the day before , only one we had broke down .
it had a bad axle ...
excuse me , sir .
there' s a problem in the cockpit .
the cockpit ?
what is it ?
the little room where the pilot sits .
that' s not important .
the first officer is ill , and the captain needs someone to help him with the radio .
do you know anything about planes ?
i flew in the war years ago .
i wouldn' t know anything about it .
would you go up , please ?
the stewardess said ...
both pilots ?
can you fly this plane and land it ?
surely , you can' t be serious .
i am serious , and don' t call me shirley .
doctor , i' ve checked everyone .
mr striker' s the only one .
what' s your flying experience ?
i flew single engine fighters , but this plane has four engines .
it' s an entirely different kind of flying ... altogether .
it' s an entirely different kind of flying .
i haven' t touched any kind of plane in six years .
mr striker , i know nothing about flying .
you' re the only one on this plane who can possibly fly it .
you' re the only chance we' ve got .
that' s right .
that' s what i said .
you heard me .
tell omaha to acknowledge and stand by .
every piece of emergency equipment available .
alert rescue units every mile of the way , from here to the rockies .
chief !
we' il need a free landing flight check .
fast .
it' s your wife .
i want the kids in bed by nine , the dog fed , the yard watered , the gate locked .
get a note to the milkman " no more cheese .
where the hell is kramer ?
no , he can' t do that .
the risk of a flame out' s too great .
keep him at 24, 000 ...
no , feet .
a passenger is going to land that plane .
is that possible ?
it' s a hundred to one shot .
i know this guy .
you do ?
who is it ?
ted striker .
i flew with him during the war .
it won' t make my job easier .
ted striker was a crack flight leader .
he was one of those men who ... felt too much inside .
maybe you know that kind .
he went all to pieces on a particular mission .
let' s just hope that doesn' t happen tonight .
let' s see ...
altitude , 24, 000 feet .
level flight .
speed , 520 knots .
course zero niner zero .
trim , mixture .
wash , soap , rinse , spin .
ted !
what are you doing here ?
you can' t fly this plane !
that' s what i' m trying to tell them .
elaine .
i don' t have time to be gentle , so i' il be very direct .
everyone is in a desperate situation .
mr striker is the only hope we got .
those are the flaps .
this is the thrust .
this must turn on the landing lights .
mayday !
mayday !
mayday ?
what the hell is that ?
may day' s the russian new year .
we' il have a big parade and serve ...
i can' t stand it any more .
i' ve got to get out of here !
calm down !
get a hold of yourself !
please let me handle this .
i' ve got to get out ...
calm down .
get to your seat .
i' il handle it .
calm down .
get ahold of yourself .
doctor , you' re wanted on the phone .
everything will be all right .
sister , i can handle this .
got to get out of here !
we' d like you to have this flower .
excuse me , sir , would you ...
donations for reverend moon ?
jews for jesus ?
read about jehovah' s witness ?
how about buddhism ?
help jerry' s kids ?
scientology ?
for nuclear power ?
your attention , please .
no frills passengers now arriving .
please have your baggage claim checks ready to show upon leaving the terminal .
this guy has no airline experience .
he' s a menace to everything in the air .
yes , birds , too .
ok , he' s a terrible risk , but what other choice have we got ?
that' s the whole story , rex .
everything we know .
let' s face a few facts .
i flew with striker during the war .
he can' t afford to worry about those times when ... things weren' t so good .
right now things aren' t so good .
let me tell you something .
striker was a top notch squadron leader long ago .
get on the horn and talk that guy down .
let him get the feel of that airplane , then you' il have to talk him right down to the ground .
very well .
put striker on the speaker .
use my radio .
i took the wrong week to quit drinking .
you can work them direct from here , captain .
striker ?
striker , this is captain rex kramer speaking .
yes , captain kramer .
read you loud and clear .
all right .
it' s obvious you remember me .
what do you say we forget about everything , except what we must do ?
let' s not kid each other , kramer .
you know i' ve never flown a bucket like this .
i' il need all the luck there is .
stand by , striker .
our one hope is to build this man up .
i' ve got to give him confidence .
striker , you ever flown a multi engine plane ?
no , never .
shit !
it' s a goddamn waste of time .
there' s no way he can land it !
you got to talk him down !
you got to !
route him into lake michigan .
at least avoid killing innocent people .
you' re the only chance they' ve got .
all right .
striker , you listen , and you listen close .
flying a plane is like riding a bicycle .
it' s just harder to put baseball cards in the spokes .
first , get the feel of the plane .
later , we' il run down the landing procedure .
all right .
disengage the automatic pilot .
make no violent control movements like you did in the fighter planes .
all right .
i' il unlock the automatic pilot .
the controls will feel very heavy compared to a fighter .
don' t worry about that .
it' s perfectly normal .
now , one more thing .
can somebody work the radio and leave you free for flying ?
the stewardess is here with me .
good .
have her sit in the co pilot seat .
elaine , he wants you to sit in the co pilot seat .
what' s going on ?
we have a right to know the truth .
all right , i' il level with you all .
the most important thing is that you remain calm .
there' s no reason to panic .
it' s true one of the crew members is ill .
slightly ill .
the other two pilots are fine .
they' re flying the plane , free to pursue a life of religious fulfilment .
the radio is all yours .
keep an eye on number three engine gauge .
it' s running a little hot .
striker , first i' d like to say something .
i know things must look pretty rough up there .
if you do what i tell you when i tell you , there' s no reason you should lack confidence in your chances of coming out alive and in one piece .
what weather are you in ?
rain .
and a little ice .
and a little ice .
how' s it handling ?
sluggish .
like a wet sponge .
sluggish .
like a wet sponge .
all right , striker .
you' re doing just fine .
it' s damn good he doesn' t know i hate his guts .
it' s damn good you don' t know he hates your guts .
can i get you something ?
i' m sorry .
i don' t understand .
stewardess .
i speak jive .
good .
he said he' s in great pain , and he wants to know if you can help him ?
tell him to relax .
i' il be back with some medicine .

they should have been in range 10 minutes ago .
gunderson , check the radar range .
anything yet ?
about two more minutes , chief .
two minutes ?
they could be miles off course .
impossible !
they' re on instruments .
this is going to be a real sweat .
gunderson , let me know when you get anything .
got a cigarette , nels ?
i can' t take much more of this .
looks like i picked the wrong week to quit amphetamines .
johnny , how about some more coffee ?
no , thanks .
these reporters want a statement .
how much longer can they hold out ?
30 , 45 minutes .
who' s flying the plane ?
a passenger .
he' s an experienced air force pilot .
no cause for alarm .
take over .
what kind of plane ?
it' s a big , pretty white plane with red stripes , curtains and wheels .
it looks like a big tylenol .
ok , boys .
let' s get some pictures .
this bulletin just handed to me .
stricken airliner approaching chicago ...
shana , they bought their tickets .
they knew what they were getting into .
i say , let them crash !
would you like some whisky , ma' am ?
certainly not !
how are the passengers ?
i won' t deceive you , mr striker .
we' re running out of time .
surely , there' s something you can do .
i' m doing everything i can ... and stop calling me shirley .
randy , are you all right ?
oh , dr rumack .
i' m scared .
i' ve never been so scared ...
and besides , i' m 26 and i' m not married .
we' re going to make it .
you' ve got to believe that .
dr rumack , do you have any idea when we' il be landing ?
pretty soon .
how are you bearing up ?
to be honest , i' ve never been so scared , but at least i have a husband .
stay in formation .
target' s just ahead .
target should be clear if you go in low enough .
you' il have to decide .
you' il have to decide .
you' il have to decide .
stay in formation .
target' s just ahead .
target should be clear if you go in low enough .
you' il have to decide .
you' il have to decide .
you' il have to decide .
oh , rats !
lost number four .
what happened ?
what went wrong ?
i forgot to check the oil pressure .
when kramer hears about this , the shit' s going to hit the fan .
i told him to watch that oil temperature .
what' s he doing ?
stiker , that plane can' t land itself .
ease off .
it' s not his fault .
it could happen to any pilot .
it happened to barbara stanwyck .
can' t push him too hard .
might break .
remember who you' re dealing with .
nick , pete , jerry , there' s a fire in the barn .
he' s right .
i can' t take the pressure .
i was crazy to think i could land this plane .
but , ted , you' re the only ...
i don' t care .
i don' t have what it takes .
they would be better off with someone who' s never flown before .
bad news .
fog' s getting thicker .
and leon' s getting larger .
i know what you' re going to say , so save your breath .
well , i don' t have a thing to say .
you' ve done the best you could .
you really have .
the best you could .
we can' t expect to win them all .
i want to tell you something i' ve kept to myself through these years .
i was in the war .
medical corps .
one night , they brought in a badly wounded pilot from one raid .
he could barely talk .
he looked up at me , he said ,
the odds were against us there , but we went in anyway .
i' m glad .
captain made the right decision .
the pilot' s name was george zip .
george zip said that ?
the last thing he said to me ,
doc , " he said , " sometime ...
.. the crew is up against it .
the breaks are beating the boys .
tell them to give it all they' ve got
and win just one for the zipper .
i don' t know where i' il be then , " he said ...
but i won' t smell too good , that' s for sure .
excuse me , doc .
i' ve got a plane to land .
you' d better stay up there a bit .
when the fog lifts , we' il bring you in .
i' il take it , elaine .
listen , dr rumack says the sick people are in critical condition .
every minute counts .
we' ve got to land now .
don' t be a fool , striker .
you know what landing like this means .
i' m ordering you to stay up there .
no dice , chicago .
i' m giving the orders , and we' re coming in .
i guess the foot' s on the other hand now .
he' il never make it in this soup .
but it' s his ship now .
he' s in charge .
he' s boss , head man , top dog , big cheese , head honcho ...
captain , look at this .
passengers certain to die .
airline negligent .

roberts , check air traffic .
get that finger out of your ear .
you don' t know where it' s been .
steve !
got a cigarette , nels ?
linda , your husband and the others are alive but unconscious .
just like gerald ford .
there' s a chance we can save them if striker lands that plane in time .
that isn' t much of a chance .
i don' t know .
we' re doing everything we can .
now excuse me .
where did you get that dress ?
it' s awful !
and those shoes and that coat !
geez !

your seat cushions are also equipped with a flotation device .
wzaz in chicago , where disco lives forever .
your altitude' s too erratic .
you can' t come straight in .
you' ve got enough fuel for two hours .
i' il take it , elaine .

we have people up here who will die in less than an hour .
i may bend your precious airplane , but i' il get it down .
the passengers are ready .

you better leave , sweetheart .
you might get hurt up here .
ted ...

the gear is down , and we' re ready to land .
he' s on final now .

captain , maybe we ought to turn on the searchlights .
no .
that' s just what they' il be expecting us to do .
i want to tell you both good luck .
we' re all counting on you .
now listen carefully .
you' il see the runway at 300 feet .
touch down a third of the way .
a slight cross wind , so be ready .
land too fast , use your emergency brakes .
red handle' s right in front .
if that doesn' t stop you ...
if that doesn' t stop you , cut the four ignition switches .
can you see us now ?
you should be able to see the field .
sure is quiet out there .
yeah , too quiet .
looks like i picked the wrong week to quit sniffing glue .
there it is .
there he is !
striker , you' re coming in too fast .
i know , i know !
he knows , he knows !

but some of us , particularly me , would like to buy you a drink and shake your hand .
and , ted , when the going got rough ...
have a nice day .
ok .

loneliness , that' s the bottom line .
