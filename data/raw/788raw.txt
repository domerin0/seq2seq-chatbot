oh , fuck .
uh , yeah ?
miles , can you move your car , please ?
why ?
because the roofers gotta get the truck in .
you didn' t park too good .
okay ?
yeah .
all right .
hold on .
sorry .
sorry , gentlemen .
sorry .
oh , fuck me !
i know i said i would be there by noon ... but , uh , there' s all of this work going on at my building ... and it' s just a total nightmare .
i had a bunch of stuff i had to deal with this morning ... but i' m on my way .
i' m out the door right now .
hi , simon .
hey , miles .
triple espresso , please ?
for here ?
uh , no , actually .
i' m running late .
make it to go .
and give me a new york times and a spinach croissant .
thank you .
ah !
well , hello !
hello , mrs. erganian .
how are you ?
come on in .
thank you .
is jack still here ?
yes .
shot on the way to the 1 1 8 .
look what the cat dragged .
hi , everybody .
sorry .
hey .
somebody finally arrived .
you finally got here .
mr. prompt .
oh , remember my kids ?
alex , helen ?
hi .
how are you ?
we were thinking maybe you went the wrong way, you went to tijuana ...
right . and they don' t let you back .
yes !
yes !
daddy !
i had to bribe them .
hey , miles .
hey .
how are you , christine ?
yeah , the freeway was unbelievable .
unbelievable .
it was bumper to bumper the whole way .
people getting an early start on the weekend , i guess .
granted , i got a late start , but
well , we' re just glad you made it .
christine , why don' t you ask miles about the cake ?
oh , good idea .
come with me .
what' s this ?
we don' t really have time for that , ' cause we gotta hit the road .
oh , come on . !
it' s just gonna take a second . !
yeah .
mmm .
jack tells us you are publishing a book .
congratulations .
uh  yes , congratulations .
yes , well , uh , it' s not exactly finalized yet .
so there has been some interest , and  your friend is modest .
oh , come on , miles .
don' t be so modest .
indulge them .
don' t make me out to be a liar .
what is the subject of your book ?
nonfiction ?
uh , no .
it' s it' s a novel .
fiction .
yes .
oh .
although there is quite a bit from my own life ... so i suppose that , technically , some of it is nonfiction .
good .
i like nonfiction .
there is so much to know about this world .
i think you read something somebody just invented it , waste of time .
that' s an interesting perspective .
so , which one do you like better ?
oh , well , i like them both .
but , um , if pressed , i would have to say that i prefer the dark .
told ya . !
bye bye .
bye .
bye .
bye .
bye .
where the fuck were you , man ?
huh ?
i was dying in there .
we' re supposed to be a hundred miles away by now .
i can' t help the traffic .
oh , come on .
you' re fucking hungover .
you know you are .
okay , there was a tasting last night , yes .
but i wanted to get us something nice for the ride up .
check out the box .
why did you tell them that my novel was being published ?
' cause you said you had it all lined up .
no , i didn' t .
no .
no .
what i said was that there was some interest at conundrum .
yeah .
conundrum .
and that one of the editors was passing it to a senior editor .
sounds pretty good to me .
sounds like you' re in .
no .
it' s a long shot .
besides , conundrum , it' s just a small specialty press .
i' m not gonna get my hopes up .
you know ?
i' ve stopped caring .
the hell with it .
i have stopped caring .
it sounds like it' s gonna happen this time .
i mean , i can feel it .
i think this is the one .
huh ?
i' m really proud of you , man .
don' t open that now .
it' s warm .
why not ?
jack , that is a 1992 byron .
it' s really rare .
okay ?
i' ve been saving it .
don' t  all right .
i won' t open it .
jack !
half of it gone .
hey , shut up .
okay ?
here' s to a great week .
come on .
yes .
absolutely .
despite your crass behavior ...
i' m actually glad we' re getting this time together .
yeah .
me too .
i' ve been looking forward to this for a long time .
was beginning to think it was never gonna happen .
man !
that' s tasty !
that' s 1 00 % pinot noir .
single vineyard .
they don' t even make it anymore .
pinot noir ?
mm hmm .
then how come it' s white ?
oh, jesus .
don' t ask questions like that up in wine country .
they' il think you' re some kind of dumbshit .
just tell me .
color in red wines comes from the skins .
this juice , on the other hand , is free run ... so that there' s no skin contact during fermentation
did you read the latest draft , by the way ?
oh, yeah . yeah .
and ?
it' s great .
i mean , there are so many improvements .
it' s much tighter .
just seems i don' t know , more congealed or something .
mm hmm .
what about the new ending ?
did you like that ?
oh , yeah .
new ending vastly superior to the old ending .
there is no new ending .
page 7 50 on is exactly the same .
well , maybe it just seemed new ... because everything leading up to it was so different ?
yeah !
that must be it !
whoa .
why are we getting off ?
uh , i just wanna make one quick stop .
for what ?
i just thought we could say a quick hello to my mother .
your mother ?
look , it' s her birthday tomorrow .
okay ?
and i don' t feel right driving by and not stopping in .
okay .
it' il take a second .
she' s right off the freeway .
okay . !
i didn' t know it was her birthday .
how old is she gonna be ?
uh , oh ... 70 something .
oh .
here , hold these for just a second .
thank you .
surprise . !
surprise !
happy birthday , mom !
happy birthday !
oh , my god !
miles !
and jack !
what a surprise !
i can' t remember the last time you brought me flowers !
happy birthday , mom .
they' re from both of us .
a famous actor bringing me flowers for my birthday !
right ?
yeah !
don' t i feel special ?
and champagne . !
famous actor' s getting married next week , mom .
oh , that' s right !
isn' t that nice .
i hope that girl knows how lucky she is ... marrying no less than derek sommersby .
gosh , that was , like , 1 1 years ago , mrs. raymond .
well, you were wonderful in that show . !
why that didn' t make you the biggest movie star in the world is a sin !
oh , now , miles ... why didn' t you tell me you were coming and bringing this handsome man ?
look how i' m dressed !
i' ve gotta run and put my face on .
you look fabulous , mrs. raymond .
oh , stop it !
make yourselves comfortable .
you boys hungry ?
yeah , i' m hungry .
along with the battle casualties ...
just a snack . the germans lost almost a million men .
to replace them , hitler turned to his last resort of manpower .
this is delicious , mrs. raymond .
absolutely delicious .
mmm .
they' re just leftovers .
i is this chicken ?
i could have made something fancier ... if a certain someone had let me know that a certain someone ... was coming for a visit and bringing a certain special friend .
it was a surprise , mom .
and i could' ve already put clean sheets ... on the other bed and the foldout .
you are staying .
wendy , ron and the twins are picking us up at 1 1 : 30 to go to brunch at the sheraton .
they do a magnificent job there .
you talked to wendy ?
just now .
she' s thrilled !
and the twins
no , no , i bet .
i bet .
yeah .
well , you know, jack is pretty eager to , uh , to get up to , um [ stammering ]
you know .
uh , but , yeah , absolutely .
we' il see how it goes .
well , you boys do what you want .
i just thought it would be nice for us to be together as a family on my birthday .
mm hmm .
mm hmm .
i' il be right back .
and what was that other one you did ?
the one where you were the jogger .
oh , that was for , um , spray ' n wash .
spray ' n wash !
that' s the one !
gosh .
i remember the girl that was in it with me .
she was somethin ' .
i just remember you jogging .
whoo hoo !
so , when' s the wedding ?
next saturday , mom .
remember ?
we told you .
and miles is my best man , mrs. raymond .
my main man .
miles , when are you going to get married again ?
i just got divorced , phyilis .
two years ago , buddy .
you should get back together ... with victoria .
she was good for you .
she was good for you !
and so beautiful , and so intelligent .
you knew her , right ?
oh, yeah .
real well .
still do .
i' m worried about you , miles .
do you need some money ?
jack .
jack .
jack , come on .
a rubber bag food slinger ?
are you kidding me ?
our super amazing tree house ... brought about by our two by four technology [ whispers ]
jack !
no , no , no , no .
she' il wake up .
who did this ?
i did !
what ?
she was tired , silly .
our ship was so high !
they need a vacation !
hamster holiday !
fun for all !
fuck !
too early in the morning for that .
you know what i mean ?
oh .
she' s a kid , for god' s sake .
as if she would even be attracted to guys like us in the first place .
speak for yourself , man .
i get chicks looking at me all the time .
all ages .
dudes too .
well , it' s not worth it .
you pay too big a price .
it' s never free .
you need to get laid , miles .
that' s gonna be my best man gift to you this week .
i' m gonna get you laid .
wonderful .
i' m not gonna get you a gift certificate or a penknife or any of that other horseshit .
i' d rather have a knife .
no .
you have been officially depressed for , like , two years now .
you' re a negative guy anyway , even back in college .
mm hmm .
and now it' s worse .
you' re wasting away .
teaching english to fucking eighth graders ?
when they oughta be reading what you wrote .
your books , miles .
i' m working on it .
not working hard enough .
are you still seeing that shrink ?
i saw him on monday .
i spent most of the time helping him with his computer .
well , i say fuck therapy and what is that stuff you take ?
xanax ?
and lexapro , yes .
well , i say fuck that too .
you need to get your joint worked on , miles .
okay, jack jack [ clears throat ]
this week is not about me .
it is about you .
i' m gonna show you a good time .
we' re gonna drink a lot of good wine , we' re gonna play some golf ... we' re gonna eat some great food , enjoy the scenery ... and we' re gonna send you off in style , mon frere .
and get your bone smooched .
you know what ?
let' s take the santa rosa road exit and hit sanford first .
okay ?
sounds good to me .
i need a drink .
these guys make top notch pinot and chardonnay .
one of the best producers in santa barbara county .
i thought you hated chardonnay .
no , no , no .
i like all varietals .
i just don' t generally like the way they manipulate chardonnay in california .
too much oak and secondary malolactic fermentation .
huh .
you see , the reason that this region is so good for pinot ... is that the cold air off the pacific flows in at night ... and it just cools down the berries .
pinot' s a very thin skinned grape .
it doesn' t like constant heat or humidity .
very delicate .
let me show you how this is done .
first thing hold the glass up and examine the wine against the light .
you' re looking for color and clarity .
just get a sense of it .
okay ?
okay .
thick ?
thin ?
watery ?
syrupy ?
okay ?
okay .
now tip it .
what you' re doing here is checking for color density as it thins out towards the rim .
that' s gonna tell you how old it is , among other things .
it' s usually more important with reds .
okay ?
okay .
now stick your nose in it .
yeah ?
don' t be shy .
really get your nose right in there .
really
mmm .
a little citrus .
maybe some strawberry .
mmm .
passion fruit .
mmm .
and ah , there' s just , like , the faintest ... [ sniffs ]
soupcon of like , uh , asparagus and
there' s a just a flutter of , like , a
like , a nutty edam cheese .
wow .
mmm !
strawberries .
yeah .
good .
strawberries .
not the cheese .
all right .
put your glass down .
get some air into it .
oxygenating it opens it up .
it unlocks the aromas , the flavors .
very important .
smell again .
ah .
that' s what you do with every one of' em .
wow .
when do we drink it ?
now .
mmm !
ahh .
mmm .
how would you rate this one , miles ?
well , usually they start you on wines with learning disabilities ... but this one is pretty damn good .
this is the new one .
right , chris ?
just released two months ago .
nice job .
we like it .
you could work in a wine store , miles .
mmm .
yeah .
that' d be a good move .
are you chewing gum ?
do you think i' m making a mistake marrying christine ?
whoa !
do you think i' m doing the right thing , miles ?
tell me the truth .
i mean , you' ve been there .
well , you know , i i think that you waited for some good reason ... and that you proposed to christine for some good reason ... so i think it' s great .
it' s time .
i mean , you gotta have your eyes open , that' s all .
i mean , look at me .
i thought victoria and i were set for life .
christine' s dad , he' s really been talking to me ... about bringing me into his property business , showing me the ropes .
which is something , considering how long it took him to get over my not being armenian .
so i' m thinking about it .
but i don' t know .
might get a little incestuous .
but mike does great .
a lot of high end commercial stuff .
so you' re gonna stop acting ?
no way !
no .
this would just provide some stability .
i could always squeeze in a commercial or an audition here , there .
keep myself in the game in case something really great came along .
we' re not getting any younger , miles .
no .
no .
hey , hey , hey . !
hey .
miles !
sir .
long time no see .
gary , nice to see you .
when' s your novel coming out ?
we all wanna read it .

when christine worked at sushi roku ... she wore a big engagement ring to keep guys from hitting on her .
think it worked ?

well , this gal is married to some philosophy professor at u. c. santa barbara .

mmm , a lot oftv .
i used to be a regular on a couple of series .
but lately it' s been a lot of commercial work .

perhaps .

that' s hilarious !
you sound just like one of those guys .
am one of those guys .
you are not .
he is .
consult your doctor before using this product .
side effects may include oily discharge ... hives , loss of appetite , low blood pressure .
if you have diabetes or a history of kidney trouble ... you' re dead , asshole !
yeah .
so , what are you guys up to tonight ?
oh , we' re pretty wiped .
i think we' re just gonna go back to the motel and crash .
yeah , i guess it' s kind of a long drive up here .
mmm .
where are you staying ?
uh , the windmill .
windmill .
the girl is looking to party ... and you tell her we' re going back to the motel and crash ?
jesus , miles !
well , i' m tired, jack .
aren' t you tired ?
the chick digs you , man !
she lit up like a pinball machine ... when she found out your novel was getting published .
now i have another lie to live down .
thanks, jack .
just trying to get you a little action .
i would appreciate a little bit of help .
didn' t seem to me like that' s what was going on .
you were all over her .
well , somebody had to do the talking .
and , by the way , i was right she' s not married .
how do you know ?
no rock .
when she came to the bar , she was sans rock .
oh .
what' s the plan for today , miles ?
aha .
good .
um , we head up north
begin the grape tour up there ... work our way south ... so that the more we drink ... the closer we get to the motel .
what' s your problem ?
what is it ?
i' m going to get my nut on this trip , miles ... and you are not gonna fuck it up for me ... with all of your depression and anxiety and neg head downer shit .
oh .
well , now the cards are on the table .
yes , they are .
ah .
and i am serious .
do not fuck with me , miles .
i am going to get laid before i get married on saturday .
do you read me ?
sure , big guy .
absolutely .
loud and clear .
whatever you say .
it' s , uh, your party , evidently .
why don' t you just , uh
uh , yeah .
why don' t you just go out , and i' il catch a train back .
no , miles !
man , this is our week to get crazy .
we should both be cutting loose .
this could be our last chance .
this is our week , man .
it' s something we should share .
this is our syrah .
okay .
ooh !
yeah ?
like that ?
that' s a big one .
but it did sit with the skins for about two weeks in an open topped tank .
so that would explain all the tannins , no ?
well , it is a young wine .
so as the wine ages , the tannins will dissipate .
right .
of course .
excuse me for just a minute .
good stuff .
mmm .
fill up there , bub .
this is our estate chardonnay .
now , there' s a girl who knows how to pour .
what' s your name ?
stephanie .
stephanie .
nice .
so , what do you think ?
mmm .
quaffable .
but , uh , far from transcendent .
i like it .
tastes great .
oak y .
this is a cabernet franc .
this is only the fifth year we' ve made this varietal .
very few wineries around here do a straight cab franc .
it' s from our vineyards up in santa maria ... and it was a silver medal winner ... at paso robles last year .
hmm .
mmm .
well , i will tell you something .
i' ve come never to expect greatness from a cab franc , and this one is no different .
it' s kind of a hollow , flabby , overripe
i don' t know .
tastes pretty good to me .
so , um , do you live around here , stephanie ?
yeah , up around los alamos .
and i agree with you about cab franc .
we' re just over in buellton .
the windmill inn .
oh , yeah ?
mmm .
do you happen to know a gal named maya that works at the hitching post ?
yeah .
sure .
i know maya .
i know her real well .
yeah ?
no shit ?
we had a drink with her last night .
miles knows her .
yes .
could we move on to the syrah , please ?
oh .
champing at the bit , huh ?
sure .
this is our estate syrah .
you are a bad , bad girl , stephanie .
i know .
i need to be spanked .
excuse me .
the syrah ?
hey .
hey .
get the trunk .
you have the keys .
i do ?
yeah .
in my pocket .
so , we' re on .

it' s beautiful .
yeah .
victoria and i used to like this view .
you know , once we had a picnic here ... and we drank a ' 95 opus one .
with smoked salmon and artichokes .
but we didn' t care .
oh , man , she has the best palate of any woman i have ever known .
she can even differentiate all different kinds of italian wines .
miles , there' s something i gotta tell you .
victoria' s coming to the wedding .
yeah , i know .

i' m all right with it .

miles , get out of the car .
would you drive me back to the motel , please ?
you know
she bringing him to the wedding ?
what do you think ?
why didn' t you tell me about this before, jack ?
because i knew you' d get so freaked out that you wouldn' t even come on this trip .
but then i thought , this is the perfect place to tell you .
we' re here to forget about all that shit .
we' re here to party , man .
i' m gonna be a fucking pariah .
persona non grata .
everybody' s gonna be holding their breath , waiting to see if i get drunk and make a scene .

andrew murray .
well , okay .
all right .
so , what gems do you have in your collection ?
oh , it' s really not much of a collection , you know .
i mean , more like a small gathering in a cabinet .
no , i' ve never really had the wallet for that .
i just have to live bottle to bottle .
i' ve got things i' m saving , definitely .
i guess the star would be a 1961 cheval blanc .

yes , i do .

hmm .
mmm .
oh , wow , that' s nice .

we need to give it a minute , but that' s really tasty .

mmm .

oh .
steph' s mom .
she spends a lot of time over there .
you got kids ?
uh , me ?
no .

no , i' d just fuck ' em up .
no , that was the one unpolluted part of my divorce no kids .
yeah .
same here .
good .
let' s go in there .
now , for a low , low 4 . 8 % a. p. r. financing [ stephanie laughing ]
looks like our friends are really hitting it off .
yeah , i would say that .
yeah .
so , what' s your novel about ?
what' s my oh , brother .
well , it' s , uh it' s difficult to summarize .
um ... it starts out as a kind of first person narrative ... about a guy taking care of his father after a stroke .
oh .
it' s kind of based on , uh , personal experience .
but only only loosely .
what' s the title ?
the day after yesterday .
oh .
you mean today .
um ... uh , yeah .
i mean , r right .
but it' s more
so it' s about , like , death and mortality , or [ sighs ]
uh , yeah
y not really .
i , uh it de it jumps around a lot .
that' s what it' s about , in a way .
you know what i mean ?
you start to see everything from the point of view of the father .
and , uh , a lot of other things happen parallel narratives .
it' s kind of a mess .
and then , eventually , the whole thing sort of evolves ... or devolves ... into this sort of robbe grillet mystery .
you know ?
but no real resolution .
wow .
it
well , i think it' s really great you' re getting it published .
really .
i mean , i know how hard it is just to write it , even .
yeah .
i mean , like me , i' ve got this paper due on friday ... and i' m freaked out about it , just like in high school .
a paper , huh ?
yeah .
i' m going for a master' s degree in horticulture .
sorta chipping away on it .
horticulture ?
really ?
mmm .
i didn' t even know that there was a college here .
well , i commute to san luis obispo twice a week .
horticulture ?
wow .
so , do you want to work in a winery or something ?
maybe .
oh .
hmm .
so , when can i read your book ?
well , i you know , i well , i do happen to have a manuscript in my car .
um , it' s not proofed or anything ... so it' s it' s full of typos .
if you don' t mind typos  oh , no .
who cares ?
i' m the queen of typos .
okay .
mmm .
ahh .
you know , can i ask you a personal question , miles ?
sure .
why are you so into pinot ?
i mean , it' s like a thing with you .
uh ...
i don' t know .
i don' t know .
um ... it' s a hard grape to grow .
as you know .
right ?
it' s , uh it' s thin skinned ... temperamental , ripens early .
it' s you know , it' s not a survivor ...
like cabernet ... which can just grow anywhere ... and thrive even when it' s neglected .
no , pinot needs constant care and attention .
you know ?
and , in fact , it can only grow ... in these really specific , little tucked away corners of the world .
and and only ... the most patient and nurturing of growers ... can do it , really .
only somebody who really takes the time ... to understand pinot' s potential ... can then coax it into its fullest expression .
and then ?
i mean
oh , its flavors , they' re just the most haunting and brilliant ... and thrilling and subtle and ... ancient on the planet .
no , i mean , you know , cabernets can be powerful and exalting too ... but they seem prosaic to me , for some reason , by comparison .
i don' t know .
i don' t know .
what about you ?
what about me ?
i don' t know .
why are you into wine ?
oh , i i think i
i originally got into wine through my ex husband .
ah .
you know , he had this big sort of show off cellar .
you know ?
right .
but then i discovered that i had a really sharp palate .
mm hmm .
and the more i drank ... the more i liked what it made me think about .
like what ?
like what a fraud he was .
wow .
no , i mean , i like to think about the life of wine .
yeah .
how it' s a living thing .
i like to think about ... what was going on the year the grapes were growing ... how the sun was shining ... if it rained .
i like to think about ... all the people who tended and picked the grapes ... and , if it' s an old wine , how many of them must be dead by now .
i like how wine continues to evolve .
like , if i opened a bottle of wine today ... it would taste different than if i' d opened it on any other day .
because a bottle of wine is actually alive ... and it' s constantly evolving and gaining complexity .
that is , until it peaks ...
like your ' 61 .
and then it begins its steady ... inevitable decline .
hmm .
and it tastes so fucking good .
yeah .
but you know , i i , uh
i like other wines besides pinot too .
i mean , lately i' ve been really into rieslings .
you like rieslings ?
rieslings ?
mm hmm .
there' s a bathroom in the back ?
yeah .
it' s through the kitchen .
i' il be right back .
god , you are such a fuckin ' loser .
you make me so fuckin ' sick .
oh , god .
ah , come on .
hi .
i was just getting some water .
okay .
you want some water ?
no .
okay .
it' s getting kind of late .
i should really go .
so you know how to get to the windmill ?
two rights and a left .
got it .
okay .
i had a nice time tonight , miles .
i really did .
good .
so did i.
okay .
well , i' il see you around then .
um
did you still want to read my novel ?
oh , yeah .
of course .
yeah .
great .
just a sec .
here .
oh , wow .
well , i hope you like it .
and feel free to stop reading it any time .
i will not be offended .
okay .
well , good night , miles .
good night .
