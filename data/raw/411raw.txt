... was so ably pointed out by the secretary general in his opening remarks .
but and i must emphasise this point no formula can , or will , ever cover each case .
for instance ...
... when three or more applicants have been recognised , which is in direct contradiction to ...
whose funeral is it ?
yours .
one more time again .
not married , by any chance , are you ?
good morning , 007 .
good ... good morning .
insomnia , sir ?
instructions .
you haven' t much time .
i' il explain as you pack .
pack , sir ?
three agents have been killed in the last 24 hours .
dawes in new york , hamilton in new orleans and baines in the caribbean .
baines .
i rather liked baines .
we shared the same boot maker .
coffee , sir ?
i take it these killings are connected ?
that' s precisely what you' re going to find out .
baines was working on a small caribbean island called san monique .
dawes was in new york , keeping an eye on its prime minister , one dr kananga .
hamilton was on loan to the americans in new orleans .
is that all it does ?
by the way , congratulations .
the italians were most impressed by the way you handled the rome affair .
thank you , sir .
sugar ?
thanks .
the authorities were more than helpful .
there' s one small complaint .
they seem to be missing one of their agents .
a miss ...
caruso .
you wouldn' t happen to know where she is ?
miss moneypenny .
morning , moneypenny .
good morning , sir .
it' s only the hour that' s indecent .
really ?
i' ve got your ticket to new york .
q has repaired your wristwatch .
and some background on san monique .
thank you , moneypenny .
i' m sure the overburdened british taxpayer will be fascinated to know will how the special ordnance section disburses its funds .
in future , commander , may i suggest a perfectly adequate watchmaker just down the street .
good god !
pulling out this button turns the watch into a hyper intensified magnetic field , powerful enough to deflect the path of a bullet
at long range or so q claims .
i feel tempted to test that theory now .
if you don' t mind , commander , my spoon .
sorry , sir .
thank you .
dr kananga is at present in new york .
the cla have been informed .
they are helping with surveillance .
your flight arrives at 11 . 30am .
now , where did i leave my coat ?
allow me .
thank you .
come along , miss moneypenny .
morning , bond .
sir .
miss moneypenny .
thank you .
goodbye , james .
or should i say ... " ciao , bello " ?
such a delicate touch .
sheer magnetism , darling .
a man comes .
he travels quickly .
he has purpose .
he comes over water .
he travels with others .
he will oppose .
he brings violence and destruction .
hello .
mr leiter for you , sir .
thank you .
hello , felix .
how are you ?
traffic permitting , i should be with you in half an hour .
then you can buy me the best lunch in new york .
hi , james .
your friend kananga has just left the un .
he' s probably headed back to his embassy .
no , don' t worry .
the place is eyeballed , wired for sound the works .
right .
i' il see you in a half hour .
easy , charlie .
let' s get there in one piece .
charlie ?
right , stand by .
here comes kananga' s limousine .
out he gets with the usual goon squad and the girl .
11 . 46 .
what is that ? !
felix ?
you know i hate to trouble you , but i' ve run into a little bother .
you what ? !
get me a make on a white pimpmobile .
3 4 7 .
nelson david george .
it would seem , dr kananga , that the conference has not
lived up to your expectations .
we can only hope that this is a temporary setback .
however , i do have some observations to make .
take a letter , please .
to secretary general , pan lsland unity conference .
sir ...
i wish to point out ... that ... too many of our island neighbours have once again let themselves be ... bullied by united states industry .
the story is an old one , the record a clear one .
since my historic statement of principles was delivered and acted upon some six months ago , our economic outlook has improved dramatically .
by exercising our policy of friendship to all with favouritism towards none , new respect for the entire area has been injected .
and even though some of my ...
james ?
that car is registered to a shop at 33 east 65th street .
that' s only a block away from here .
right .
take your time , buddy .
kananga' s knitting a flag in there .
it might be the easiest thing to do .
something ... in heads ?
just browsing , thank you .
five dollars .
do you think you could giftwrap it for me , please ?
lengthwise , if you don' t mind .
thank you .
... remains my first concern .
thus san monique' s obligations to her island neighbours would seem clear .
those who fawn and crawl in the face of intimidation must perforce look up to those who stand , proudly , wrapped in a justifiable self confidence .
the time has come , painful as it may be , to gaze out among our sister nations in the area and see if any stands ...
he' s tailing .
i got him in my sights .
you know where you' re goin ' , man ?
uptown , i believe .
uptown ?
we headin ' into harlem , man .
just keep on the tail of that jukebox and there' s an extra $20 for you .
man , for 20 bucks , i' d take you to a ku klux klan cookout .
125th .
you got a honky on your tail .
he' s heading east .
can' t miss him .
it' s like following a cue ball .
that' s the car .
they must have gone inside .
pull up where you can .
sure hope you make friends easy .
right on , brother .
he' s headin ' on in !
good afternoon .
bourbon and water , please .
the first booth will do .
tell him neat , would you ?
no ice .
that' s extra , man .
i' d like something on the side as well .
information .
three men and a girl came in ...
relax , baby .
mr big' s gonna take care of you in a minute .
black queen on the red king , miss ... ?
solitaire .
my name' s bond .
james bond .
i know who you are , what you are , and why you' ve come .
you' ve made a mistake .
you will not succeed .
rather a sweeping statement , considering we' ve never met .
the cards have followed you for me .
you get ripped off in detroit , you yell out to me !
d' you hear ?
is he armed ?
you can' t be too careful in new york city .
funny how the least little thing amuses him .
fascinating .
that' s you , quite obviously .
an amazing resemblance .
am i in there as well ?
pick a card .
turn it over .
you have found yourself .
i' m telling you , go out to la and clean it up or i' m coming out there and clean " you " up .
and i mean that !
is this the stupid mother that tailed you uptown ?
there seems to be some mistake .
my name ...
names is for tombstones , baby .
y' all take this honky out and waste him now !
" waste him " ?
is that a good thing ?
the reading is over .
nothing about my future ?
us ?
now , promise you' il stay right there .
i shan' t be long .
thank you .
keep your hands up , honky .
what' s he think this is ?
blow his friggin ' head off .
drop it !
now .
harold strutter , cla .
where were you when i didn' t need you ?
it got obvious you weren' t coming out front .
not even with that clever disguise you were wearing .
a white face in harlem .
good thinking , bond .
let' s get outta here .
i' m surprised they didn' t spot you .
there' s a remarkable girl back there with a deck of cards .
i saw those cards on the way up .
spades , james .
every one .
you were nailed the minute you left 74 .
only one man can pull together that much black muscle in this town .
calls himself mr big .
you name the business .
they say he has a black concession .
what would a foreign prime minister like kananga want with an american gangster ?
question is , what would mr big want with a two bit island diplomat ?
mr big ?
where the hell does " he " fit into this mess ?
a genuine felix lighter . illuminating .
now listen , james ,
kananga' s got a private plane and he' s leaving for san monique within the hour .
get me on the next available flight .
i already did .
i knew you wouldn' t pass up a chance to get away from where the " real " action is .
the legendary baron samedi , folks .
that' s saturday , for those who speak french .
voodoo god of cemeteries and chief of the legion of the dead .
the man who cannot die .
but , for our purposes , just a performer in a musical extravaganza we' ve cooked up for you wonderful people .
good evening .
the name' s bond .
i have a reservation .
mr bond .
of course .
mrs bond' s been expecting you .
mrs bond ?
she arrived earlier this afternoon .
said she preferred something a little more ... private .
bungalow 12 .
an incurable romantic mrs bond .
room service , please .
room service ?
this is mr bond .
bungalow 12 .
i' d like a bottle of bollinger , please .
slightly chilled .
two glasses .
thank you .
anybody home ?
your champagne , sir .
what was that ?
your champagne .
put it on the table , thanks .
shall i open it ?
what ?
shall i open it ?
oh , no .
i can manage .
thank you .
here you are .
thank you .
mrs bond , i presume ?
i' m rosie carver .
i guess i have a little explaining to do .
yes .
either you or dear uncle felix .
custom 38 , smith & wesson .
corrugated three inch stock , no serial number , standard cla issue .
why point it at me ?
the man who delivered your champagne is not a hotel waiter .
i was just trying to be careful .
as for felix leiter , you' re right .
i' ve worked for cla down here for some time now .
he cabled me you were coming and asked if i would help out if i could .
perhaps you' d better start by getting your head together .
there' s a mirror in the bathroom .
yes .
you' re only my second mission , you know .
my first was baines .
the agent who was killed .
it' s a relief to know i' m next in line for the same kind of aid .
there' s a ...
a snake !
i should have told you .
you should never go in there without a mongoose .
i should have never gotten into any of this !
i' m going to be completely useless to you .
i' m sure we' il be able to lick you into shape .
it' s ... getting late , mrs bond .
tomorrow will be a very busy day .
you see , kananga is protecting something down here .
something which baines obviously discovered .
you' re going to show me the spot where baines ' body was found .
that , i' m afraid , only leaves us tonight to ... catch up on old times .
felix told me there' d be moments like this .
what did good old felix suggest ?
if all else failed , cyanide pills .
i settled for two bedrooms .
good night , mr bond .
mrs bond .
it' s just a hat , darling , belonging to a small headed man who lost a fight with a chicken .
it' s a warning .
get it outta here !
oh , please !
please don' t leave me alone tonight .
james , please promise me !
all right , darling , if you insist ...
i promise .
thank you .
rosie !
breakfast' s up !
rosie !
are you ready yet ?
what ?
i have to see about organising a car .
i' il see you in the lobby .
over here , sir !
guarantee big fish .
catch big fish , sir !
hey , baby !
over here !
bring your man over here !
just $20 !
have a date !
you got warm lady ?
we got cold beer over here , man .
you wanna catch a big fish , sir ?
it' s only 2 over here .
good morning .
come on , rosie .
this one seems eager enough .
excuse me !
where can i change ?
me ... clothes off ... where ?
stop right there .
turn around slowly .
keep your hands up !
as i was saying , quarrel , a lousy agent .
but the compensations speak for themselves .
rosie carver , meet the man who shares my hairbrush .
quarrel junior .
i' m really sorry .
i could have shot you .
you might have even killed me if you' d taken off the safety catch .
never mind , darling .
you just let us know when we get to the spot where baines was killed .
it' s up in the hills , just after we clear the next cove .
hey , quarrel !
who the hell lives up there ?
that' s the house of the kananga woman .
she' s supposed to have the power of the obeah .
no one on the island dare go up there except him .
he comes again .
there will be violence .
he approaches even now .
by land or water ?
water .
he has arrived .
good .
rosie' s been more efficient than i anticipated .
i know where we could rustle up a car .
beautiful , brave , and now resourceful .
rosie , you seem to be staging a remarkable comeback .
tell me about the future .
is it death ?
i said , is it death ?
it is death .
they' re coming .
rosie knows what to do .
now , i want no bodies this time .
no trace .
it' s down there .
but ...
i thought you said baines was killed up in the hills , darling .
up in the hills , down there .
why don' t we have a bite of lunch and discuss it ?
there' s an excellent pt in the hamper .
i' m in no hurry .
are you ?
no .
james !
you don' t know what finding you has meant to me .
i can imagine .
and you' ve no idea what finding this has meant to me .
you do know what the queen of cups means in an upside down position ?
a deceitful , perverse woman .
a liar , a cheat .
and i' d like some answers now .
please ...
you don' t understand , sir .
they' il kill me if i do .
and i' il kill you if you don' t .
but you couldn' t .
you wouldn' t .
not after what we' ve just done .
i certainly wouldn' t have killed you before .
it used to be a convincing act , rosie .
it' s wearing a little thin now .
it' s not an act .
it' s ...
make your choice .
rosie !
you will explain what went wrong .
i see the intervention of a woman .
the girl was about to confess .
we had to kill her .
the trap was set .
tee hee was waiting .
and you saw death .
it must have been the girl' s death .
if you do not ask specific questions ,
i cannot be responsible for your misinterpretation of the answers .
these growing signs of impertinence begin to disturb me , solitaire .
as they did with your mother before you .
she had the power and lost it .
became useless to me .
you will not make the same mistake ,
solitaire .
where is bond now ?
where is bond now ? !
i cannot see when you are this way with me .
things become unclear .
let us hope these momentary lapses do not become a habit .
your power exists to serve me .
and it is mine to control .
if and when the time comes i decide you are to lose it , i myself will take it away .
solitaire , go to sleep .
you have made me angry with you , and i have no wish to be .
tee hee ...
put down those cards !
it is a blasphemy !
they tell nothing to those who cannot see .
but they do .
that' s a ... a bit of luck .
good luck , for both of us .
the cards say we will be lovers .
you are mistaken .
it' s impossible .
forbidden for me .
now you must go .
but you do believe ...
i mean really " believe " in the cards ?
they have never lied to me .
then they won' t now .
pick one .
you knew the answer before it was given .
strangely enough , somehow ... so did i.
so it' s finally happened .
just as it did to my mother ... and her mother before her .
of course it did .
you' re visual proof of that , aren' t you ?
come on , cheer up , darling .
there has to be a first time for everyone .
now tell me , where' s kananga ?
i cannot see .
oh , yes , the cards .
i' il get them .
no !
there' s no need to be frightened .
you' il soon be rid of him , i promise .
i promise .
i just need a
little bit of information , that' s all .
the power ...
i' ve lost it .
the high priestess is wife to the prince no longer of this world .
the spiritual bridge to the secret church .
it was my fate .
by compelling me to earthly love , the cards themselves have taken away my powers .
darling , i' ve ... a small confession to make .
now , try not to be too upset .
the deck was slightly stacked in my favour .
it makes no difference .
the physical violation cannot be undone .
when he finds out i' ve lost my power ... he' il kill me .
oh , now , come on .
he' il have to find you first .
we have no secrets .
for example , i have a boat waiting .
you can be on it .
all i have to know before we leave is ... what goes on back there in voodoo land .
darling , three men and a girl have been killed in the last four days .
not counting the times they' ve tried to stop me from discovering what kananga' s protecting .
now , do you want to be on that boat or not ?
i simply read the cards for him .
i have never been there , and he' s never taken me there .
i' ve never dared to go .
but i' ve looked in the cards .
i' ve seen great riches there .
they' il kill you .
us , darling .
they will kill " us " .
togetherness .
till death do us part , or thereabouts .
is there time before we leave for lesson number three ?
absolutely .
there' s no sense in going off half cocked .
this way .
how can you be so sure ?
these scarecrows are to scare " people " away .
you' re not scared , are you ?
follow the scarecrows .
good morning , boss .
morning .
it' s sure gonna be a " beautiful " day .
yes , sir , a " beautiful " day !
they' re heading for the hill .
they' re here .
if he finds it , kill him .
quick !
we' ve lost him .
he has the girl .
they' re somewhere under the nets .
at any cost any bond must die .
unit 2 5 .
we have picked them up .
base to 2 5 .
arrest bond .
but i repeat , the girl is not to be touched .
message received and understood .
over and out .
base to all units .
i repeat , the girl is not to be touched .
get out of the way !
sweet mother of pearl !
all change !
end of the line !
get down below , quickly !
here , i' il do that .
you get her started .
it appears ... a bus .
james !
he' il be looking for me now .
i know he' il never stop .
come on , darling .
it' s all over .
voodoo land was just poppy fields .
a simple matter of heroin smuggling .
i' il have a word with a man named felix , turn the case over to him , and you and i will be off .
by the way , where would you like to go ?
anywhere where we can find one of these .
how quickly can we make it to new orleans ?
santa mina , four hours away ...
you could catch a flight and be there in the morning .
get in touch with felix .
tell him to meet me there tomorrow .
royal orleans hotel .
tampa is closer .
hamilton was killed in new orleans , so there has to be a connection .
and this is a valuable piece of merchandise we' re carrying .
which , with any luck , they' il want back .
royal orleans hotel , please .
are you sure this is the way to new orleans ?
i don' t know , but this sure beats the hell out of harlem , don' t it ?
well , hello , jim !
what' s happenin ' , baby ?
just ease back now , jim .
relax !
mr big wants to see you .
you made a mistake back on that island , bond .
you took something that didn' t belong to you , from a friend of mr big' s .
that type of mistake is tough to bounce back from .
but i' ve only just arrived .
today is your lucky day , jim !
you' re going skydiving !
there' s a helluva view of the lake from 10, 000 feet .
my only regret is i won' t be there to see it .
let' s go !
good morning .
you' re ...
mrs bell .
you' re not my instructor .
where' s mr bleeker ?
indisposed .
i' il be giving the lesson .
what' s on for today ?
let' s just wing it , shall we , mrs bell ?
you' re over revving .
leroy , slow down , for pete' s sake !
do what the man say !
i can' t ...
i can' t find the brake !
close those doors !
holy shit !
