for some , time passes slowly .
an hour can seem an eternity .
for others , there' s never enough .
for the tucks , it didn' t exist .
time is like a wheel ... turning and turning , never stopping and the woods are the center , the hub of the wheel .
it began the first week of summer a strange and breathless time , when accident , or fate bring lives together when people are led to do things they' ve never done before .
on this summer' s day , not so very long ago the wheel set lives in motion in mysterious ways .
it set mae tuck out in her wagon for the village of treegap to meet her two sons as she did once every ten years .
ma !
miles !
jesse !
oh ... !
oh , i missed you .
what are you doing here ?
oh , i couldn' t wait to see you .
i missed you , jesse .
oh , wait , i got something for you .
oh , look at you .
i got something .
here , look .
the eiffel tower .
would you look at that .
got it in paris , france .
oh , mom , you' ve never seen anything
so tall in your life .
hello ...
oh , i got something else .
i got something else .
how are you , old friend ?
your favorite ... chocolates .
oh , i' ve died and gone to heaven .
oh , jesse .
miles ...
miles .
give your mother a hug .
ten years .
you' re as cozy as barbed wire .
i have you back .
winifred !
winifred !
yes , mother ?
i need a new name .
one that' s not all worn out from being called so much .
come inside this instant .
you' re getting filthy !
ow !
i can scarcely breathe .
you must suffer to be beautiful .
so say the french .
the french are crazy .
for winnie foster one thing was true : the heat of summer was not nearly as stifling as the formality of her life .
with every passing day the feeling grew stronger .
she was coming closer to the end of something and moving towards the beginning of something new .
change was in the air .
it was only a question of when .
wait for me in the car .
i won' t be a minute .
in the car , mrs. foster .
throw it home !
throw it home !
come on , throw it home !
go !
run to me !
yay !
no , no , no , no , no .
too large for tea cakes .
none of these will do .
i prefer petit fours .
what kind of a funny hat is that ?
well , look' ee here .
if it' s not miss moneybags in her fancy car .
what' s the matter ?
don' t want to get your feet dirty ?
well , i' m sorry , mrs. foster .
not much call for such treats out here .
well , i could just make them up for you , special .
winnie foster ?
you' ve got to be kidding !
wow !
winnie , run !
run , winnie , run !
throw it !
throw it !
throw it home !
come on !
slide , winnie , slide !
winifred !
oh , and they had their arms crossed and you see , the lines were perfectly square .
come here , come here .
i want to teach you .
come on .
oh , all the way from france .
how about that ?
oh , look .
look look at this one .
i want to see , pop .
let me see .
look it .
oh !
aah , he shot me !
oh , i' m dead !
oh , oh , my !
oh , my !
oh , you' il have to see this one .
miles , look at this !
oh ... let' s see .
okay , come here , i want to show you .
i want to show you .
all right .
good to have you home , son .
i' m glad to see you .
and the family together .
but don' t get used to it .
war' s coming , i hear .
i' m joining up .
i' m going to fight the huns .
get as far away from this place as i can .
oh , you think that' il solve things , do you ?
you haven' t had enough killing for two lifetimes ?
somebody' s on to us .
i know it .
there' s a man who' s been following us and we' ve lost him several times , but ... he keeps coming back .
i think he knows something .
this man ...
jesse ...
whoo !
we' re being tracked .
oh , miles , we lost him .
don' t go spoiling everything .
yeah , we lost him , jess ... but he keeps coming back .
it was only a matter of time before someone found us .
the world is closing in .
entire forest is almost gone .
all except this little wood .
i saw tire marks down on the lower wash ... a few weeks ago .
there' il be more .
i don' t want anyone going to town .
not for anything , and that' s that .
tuck .
you see any strangers in the woods getting too close you know what to do .
no exceptions .
our time here is almost done .
i can feel it .
you' il never catch one that way .
do you know about catching fireflies ?
afraid not , never tried .
i prefer ... bigger game .
though i suspect the strategy is much the same .
strategy ?
one must never announce one' s presence to the prey .
one must become part of the scenery ... invisible ... almost disappear .
and be patient until the exact , right moment arrives ...
take a prisoner .
for you ?
no , thank you .
you' re quite right .
a girl of your age should find ... trapping suitors more interesting than trapping insects , anyway .
far easier , i might add .
have you lived here long ?
forever .
why ?
i' m ... looking for some old friends who live hereabouts .
thought you might help me find them .
my father practically built treegap .
he knows everyone .
perhaps he can help you .
perhaps .
i quite like talking to you .
winifred ?
winifred , who are you talking to out there ?
i don' t know .
he hasn' t told me his name .
good evening , madam .
please forgive my intrusion .
this young lady tells me you' ve lived here forever .
i thought you might know of a certain family goes by the name of ...
i hardly know everyone , nor do i want to .
and i don' t stand outside discussing such a thing with ... strangers .
then i beg your pardon .
good evening , young lady .
madam .
this is why i worry about you , winifred .
you don' t have the sense not to talk to a man like that .
a proper education gains one entr into society .
your mother and i have given this a great deal of thought .
middlehouse academy for girls in pensford , has an excellent reputation .
middlehouse ?
but that' s a terrible place , everyone says so .
it' s like a jail .
nonsense .
girls emerge from there as refined young ladies well versed in etiquette and manners , both of which you are sorely lacking .
but i don' t want to be one of those girls .
which is precisely why you must go .
i cannot let your unbridled nature ruin your chances for a respectable future .
winifred ...
i' m sorry ... but we have to do what' s best for you .
i won' t do it .
i' m not like those girls .
i won' t go !
winifred !
i won' t go !
winnie foster was to be sent 500 miles away to be educated .
but what her parents didn' t understand was she only wanted to step just outside her fence ... so she did .
what in these quiet woods should be so forbidden ?
winnie had always sensed a mystery waiting for her there .
it was a place so entirely different from what she knew so far away from her tight , pruned world .
ah !
ah ...
how long have you been standing there ?
not long at all .
i was only walking past , and i ...
well , you shouldn' t ... be in these parts of the woods .
it' s best you turn around and go home .
well , go on , now , get !
excuse me , but i own these woods , and ...
i' il go on and get when i want to .
you own these woods ?
yes , i do .
what' s your name ?
winifred .
winnie ...
foster .
a foster ?
well , i' il be .
is that a fact ?
well ...
winnie foster , like i was saying you need to turn around and go home .
it just so happens that i was on my way home before you made your rude suggestion and i would be happy to continue on my way if i only knew which way to go .
in other words , you' re lost ?
i' il point you home .
i' d be much obliged .
but i want a drink first .
wait ... no !
no !
what ?
you don' t want that water .
uh , it' s poisoned .
i saw you drink some .
well , now i' m feeling sick .
you don' t look ill .
i' m dry as dust .
i said , leave it alone !
let go of me !
my father will have you arrested !
you' re not going to go and tell him , now , are you ?
hey !
come back !
don' t run away !
come back !
where you going so fast , miss ?
miles , wait !
no !
no !
you know what tuck said , jesse .
no exceptions .
help !
you can' t do this .
stop !
let go !
we can' t .
miles !
miss foster !
miss foster !
miss foster !
where are you ? !
ho .
we' re stopping here .
not a word out of you , hear me ?
miles !
what are you doing ?
no !
let the poor girl go .
there' s no reason to be frightened , young lady .
i caught her at the spring with jesse .
she' s a foster .
oh , lord .
it' s finally happened .
i want to go home , please .
i want to go home .
there , there , child .
please don' t cry .
we' re not bad people .
we' il take you home just as soon as we can .
i promise .
miles , go find your father .
he' s across the lake .
he' il know what to do with her .
tell jesse i' m going to fix that mouth of his .
i' ve heard that .
have you ?
it' s , it' s my little music box .
i found it in the forest one day .
just waiting for me , i expect .
i' ve had it a long , long time .
oh !
i put my baby boys to bed with it every night .
gave ' em such sweet dreams .
i' m sure my boys didn' t mean you any harm .
then why did they bring me here this way ?
why am i here ?
you have every right to be upset .
and i know your family must be ... worried sick about you .
where' s the child ?
she' s no child ...
angus .
does she know ?
why do you think i brought her ... ?
yeah , but now she knows about us , thanks to you .
shh !
shh !
she' s a foster , she only knows ...
know what ?
miss foster , this is my husband , angus tuck .
angus , meet miss foster .
hello , miss foster .
she' s the most important event that' s taken place in this house in 80 years .
you hungry ?
oh , well , let' s , let' s all eat .
yeah .
jesse , pass your mother a plate , please ?
mmm , where' s the fish ?
oh , they weren' t biting for some reason .
' cause pa can' t fish ?
don' t matter .
there' s plenty .
i catch fish .
if there' s no fish , there' s no fish if you keep scaring the fish away .
mmm , this looks good .
oh !
isn' t this nice ?
everybody sitting down together and having miss foster here .
it' s just like having a party .
my father will come looking for me .
your father ... will cut down the entire forest the way things are changing around here .
make himself a very rich man .
oh , now , let' s not ruin a perfectly good meal with a lot of talk .
my father has plenty of money .
he' il pay .
anything you want .
we don' t want your father' s money , miss foster .
then let me go home .
we will .
we' il let you go home ... just like i promised .
directly .
we' il need to be able to trust her first before we' re sending her back to her folks .
trust her ?
we can' t trust her .
or any normal people .
she' il turn on us in a second .
no , she won' t .
you' re a fool .
you don' t even realize what you' ve done here .
him .
it' s him .
robert !
i expect you to find her , henry .
that' s your job .
i' ve already wired her description down the main line .
they' il keep a lookout and we' il get up a search party come morning .
my wife is certain that this man wearing a yellow suit has something to do with winifred' s disappearance .
and miss foster says so based on ... ?
her instincts .
hmm .
well , maybe you better step in here , mr. foster .
am i whom you' re looking for ?
i do believe i fit the description .
my wife said she saw you talking to my daughter .
yes , i did .
she' s a charming girl , full of fire .
perhaps too much .
she' s gone , is she ?
looks like she ... ran away .
did she now ?
somehow i' m not surprised .
my daughter did not ... run away .
and i' m not interested in what surprises you , sir .
i want to know if you know anything of her whereabouts .
no , mr. foster .
i' m sorry to disappoint you , but i do not .
i am quite coincidentally here in search of someone myself .
i' m seeking a family that used to live in these environs .
i thought the constable could help me locate them , but ironically , mr. foster your daughter thought you could help .
name of tuck .
long lost relatives .
i i can' t help you .
nor i you .
at least not now .
however , i' d be happy to search your woods for you , mr. foster .
i' m rather talented at finding people .
i just might meet with success .
good evening , constable .
find out what happened to her , henry .
please .
she' s our only child .
angus made that cradle .
brought it all the way from scotland .
oh , it' s rocked a few tucks .
there you go .
the breeze off the lake will keep you cool all night .
the boys sleep up in the loft when they' re home so you' il have your privacy .
oh , that corset looks painful .
may i help you off with it ?
oh , honestly , i can' t understand why women torture themselves this way .
it' s no way to live .
do you have a daughter ?
a granddaughter .
and a grandson .
anna and beau .
oh , miles loved them so .
what happened ?
they died .
their mother , too .
i' m afraid the good parts of miles died along with them .
you' il have to forgive what' s left of him .
i' m sorry .
well , it' s ... it' s the way things are , miss foster .
can i call you winnie ?
do you have brothers and sisters ?
no , it' s only me .
my mother ...
there .
so where do they go ?
oh , they go different places , do different things .
miles can do carpentry and he' s good with his hands .
jesse , now , he seems to have settled himself .
of course , then , he' s ... he' s young yet .
well ...
i hope you will be comfortable here .
it' s a good feeling having another woman here .
try and get some sleep now .
hello ?
have you lost your way , friend ?
not hardly , reverend .
i' m looking for a family name ...
tuck .
are you familiar with it ?
tuck .
tuck ?
i' m afraid i can' t help you .
there are no tucks in this cemetery that i know of .
no , i wouldn' t think so .
ha !
or in any other .
tell me , reverend you who have attended so many deathbeds ... what is it people most desire as they face the end of their lives ?
more time ?
well , i suppose .
exactly .
they' d give almost anything , i imagine , for one more year .
imagine what they' d give for all eternity .
sir , i don' t quite understand what ...
you will .
reverend , are you prepared to die right now , this instant ?
if it' s god' s will .
what if it is my will ?
what if you could be eternal ?
right now , this instant ?
without having to face the uncertainty of death ?
hmm ?
you' d like that , wouldn' t you ?
no muss , no fuss .
invincible to disease .
never having to suffer the stench and rot of old age .
forever young .
you speak blasphemy , sir .
fluently .
good night , reverend .
hey , winnie foster , you asleep ?
not anymore .
good .
hey .
listen .
how would you like to see the eiffel tower ?
what ?
someday .
no , now .
while the day is still ours .
get those dogs over there .
yes , sir .
come on , boys , let' s go .
henry , this is winifred' s nightgown .
give it to the dog handlers .
start in the north end .
let' s split up when we get to the lake .
we' il find her .
i know we will .
winifred !
miss foster !
winnie !
winifred foster !
miss foster !
winifred !
over here !
i found something !
there it is .
this is the eiffel tower ?
the one in paris , it' s pretty tall .
mine' s two feet higher .
here .
come on .
have you really seen the real one in paris ?
yes , i have .
and climbed 1, 652 stairs to the top .
much easier than this .
yes .
you doing all right ?
i think so .
you' re doing great .
here .
if i went to the eiffel tower
i would take one of those elevators .
not with me .
you' d take off your shoes and walk up every single solitary step .
how old are you ?
do you really want to know ?
yes .
104 .
i' m serious .
so am i.
let' s just call it 17 .
there' s my paris .
the view from the eiffel tower can' t be better than this .
i' ve seen a lot of views , and this is one of the best .
come on .
winnie foster was beginning to lose track of time .
had she been there a day , a week , a month ?
it seemed to winnie that the tucks lived in a way the rest of the world had forgotten .
they were never in a hurry and did things the slow way .
for the first time
winnie felt free to explore , to ask questions , to play .
# #
me ?
i' m going to see the world .
every speck of it .
heck , i may even find some new continents or something .
i mean , i' ve been to a lot of places but the world is huge !
jesse tuck , what what are you doing ?
what does it look like ?
woo hoo !
woo !
ah , whoo .
come on !
i can' t !
why ?
you' re not afraid of a little cold water , are you ?
no .
are you afraid of me ?
no .
well , what then ?
i can' t swim .
you' re joshing me .
i wish i were .
so , you' re afraid you' il drown , right ?
swallow too much water , sink to the bottom and die .
thank you for putting it so vividly .
and , yes , considering i' d sink like a rock drowning is a fair concern .
well , i guess i' m just going to have to enjoy this all by myself .
hmm ...
hmm !
ah , jesse !
hey , hey , it' s okay .
come here , come here , come here .
i' ve got you , i' ve got you .
i' ve got you , relax .
relax against me .
you all right ?
i think so .
whoo !
you did it !
i did it !
ah , it feels wonderful .
i' m weightless .
that' s ' cause we' re carrying you , see ?
the water and me .
we' re both carrying you .
you like the feeling ?
i love it .
jesse , don' t let go !
it' s okay , it' s okay .
there' s no chance of that , winnie foster .
i' m never going to let you go .
# #
# #
you know , i don' t like being laughed at by a cheat .
now " cheat " is a nasty word , sir .
i much prefer " card sharp .
you are looking for trouble , aren' t you , mister ?
yes , sir , i sure am .
going outside !
come on !
perhaps next time ...
come on !
he can' t hurt me !
whoo !
thank you .
thank you very much .
excuse me , citizen .
you hear that ?
tuck says it' s the most melancholy sound in all of nature .
listen .
just listen .
they' re playing for you .
# #
whoo !
yeah !
# #
# #
# #
i wish this moment could last forever .
forever ?
you want to spend forever with me , winnie ?
i do .
you know , we could see the world together .
we could do everything together .
have a million moments like this one that ... never , never stop .
there' s a part about us you don' t know ... the part i' ve sworn not to tell you .
the secret ?
the reason you don' t want anyone to find out about you ?
i knew it .
you' re ... you' re bank robbers or grifters .
you are the first human i' ve ever met
i wanted to know the truth .
jesse tuck , you' re the first human i' ve ever met that i' ve ever wanted to ... to ...
... to do that .
winnie , listen .
remember the giant oak tree at the center of the wood where we met ?
the little spring bubbling up you saw me drink from ?
you remember when i told you i was 104 years old ?
well ... it' s the honest truth .
i' m going to live forever .
i' m never going to change .
the same with miles and tuck and mae .
something happened to us .
as far as i know , i' m ...
i' m going to be 17 until the end of the world .
it' s the spring , winnie .
the water , something' s wrong with it .
it stops you right where you are .
if you had a drink of it today , you' d stay just like you are .
don' t you wish he' d told you ... before you kissed him ?
did he tell you immortality isn' t all the preachers crack it up to be ?
hey , leave her alone , miles .
oh , now ... you want her to hear it , jesse boy .
she' s the first person you want to tell the truth to .
you just don' t want me to have what you lost .
stop this ... ... both of you and tell me the truth .
i want to know .
we all had a drink ... ... except for the cat ... that' s important .
the water tasted like ...
heaven .
floated over your tongue like a cloud .
tuck carved a " t " in the trunk , to mark where we' d been .
we moved on west , looking for a place to settle down .
put up a house for mae and tuck and a little shed for jesse and me .
that was the first time we figured there was something ... peculiar .
jesse fell 30 feet , landed right on his neck .
he was up on his feet again before mae could work up a good cry .
didn' t hurt him a bit .
no broken bones ... nothing .
that' s not all .
not by a long shot .
things began to happen . # #
some brushpoppers mistook
mae' s horse for a deer .
thing is , the bullets didn' t kill him .
barely even left a mark .
then tuck got bitten by a rattlesnake , and you know what ?
he didn' t die ... ... but the cat did of old age .
# #
and miles got married .
daddy !
beau .
little anna .
tuck figured it early on .
it' s the spring .
we all drank from it , even the horse .
had to be ... the source of our changelessness .
i begged her to come back ... for me and find the spring and drink from it .
the children , too .
it was our only hope to be together .
she made up her mind
i' d sold my soul to the devil ... ... and she left me .
she took my babies with her .
everyone ... pulled away after that .
there was talk of witchcraft ... black magic .
# #
i went looking for wars to fight ... and i saw brave men die at vera cruz ... and then gettysburg ... thousands , in the blink of an eye ...
: ... but not me .
i couldn' t die ...
... like little anna .
the influenza took her before she' s 15 .
and beau .
he' d be almost 80 now if he were still alive .
and my sweet ...
... my sweet young bride .
she died in an insane asylum ... ... old and alone .
but i' m still here .
i' m still here .
# #
# #
# #
# #
winnie foster , you' re the only other person in the world who knows about us .
we' il have to have a talk .
pa .
come on .
# #
# #
look around you .
it' s teeming life .
it' s flowers and trees and frogs .
it' s ... it' s all part of the wheel .
it' s always changing ; it' s always growing
like you , winnie .
your life is never the same .
you were once a child .
now , you are about to become a woman .
one day , you' il grow up and you' il do something important .
you' il have children , maybe , and then one day you' il go out ... just like the flame of a candle .
you' il make way for new life .
that' s a certainty .
that' s the natural way of things .
and then , there' s us .
what we tucks have , you can' t call it living .
we just ... are .
we' re like rocks , stuck at the side of a stream .
listen to me .
winnie , you know a dangerous secret .
if people find out about the spring they' il trample all over each other to get to that water .
there' s one thing i' ve learned about people .
many will do anything , anything not to die and they' il do anything to keep from living their life .
do you want to stay stuck as you are right now , forever ?
i' ve just got to make you understand .
i don' t want to die .
is that wrong ?
no .
no human does ... but i it' s part of the wheel ... the same as being born .
you can' t have living without dying .
don' t be afraid of death , winnie .
be afraid of the unlived life .
# #
# #
# #
your tea , sir .
she' s with them now .
i came directly here , knowing how tormented you must be .
we we just want her back safely .
course you do .
dreadful business , kidnapping .
fortunate i was witness .
i' m perhaps the only person ... who knows where to find her .
just what is your game , sir ?
what is my game ?
you detect in me a playful mood ?
playful " is not the word i had in mind .
what i have in mind is a simple , clear cut trade .
you see , i very much like your woods not for their timber , mind you but for their natural assets .
wh what is it you want ?
you want your daughter .
i want your woods .
you' re involved in this , aren' t you ?
if you have touched my daughter ... !
i have my faults , mr. foster .
kidnapping is not amongst them .
these are rough people , the ones who took her .
no telling what they might do .
unless we do what you say .
give the man whatever he wants .
done and done .
nice to have things legal and tidy , don' t you agree ?
you' re an intelligent , reasonable man , mr. foster .
i' m seldom wrong as a judge of character .
have your friendly constable on hand to make the appropriate arrests .
your terrible ordeal is as good as over .
i' il get there before you .
we have to move quickly .
they were packing to leave .
what kind of horrible people must these kidnappers be ?
there is evil in the world , mr. foster .
there aren' t fences high enough to keep it out .
bring your men directly to my house .
i' m going with you .
# #
# #
it isn' t fair , tuck .
no , it isn' t ... but when has life ever been fair ?
how am i going to take you home when i can' t make my feet move from this spot ?
if i could die tomorrow , i' d do it ... just to spend one more night with you .
forgive me for interrupting such a tender moment .
hello , winifred .
everyone' s been so worried about you .
i' m relieved to find you so well .
you know this man ?
i met him once .
hello , mr. tuck .
you have no idea what a pleasure it is to meet you .
you' re the man who' s been following my boys .
been expecting you .
yes , and here i am .
tell me , is it a relief ... to finally be discovered ?
over a century of hiding out must have taken its toll on you .
who are you ?
and how do you know so much about us ?
i first heard about your family from my grandmother .
she knew a woman in a mental facility who used to ... rant and ramble about a family who never grew old and never died .
this woman , she used to call out a name .
what was it , now ?
anna .
crazy old woman .
kept on talking about a music box .
it seems the melody had a calming effect on her children .
i' m sure you know it , mrs. tuck ?
you have no right ... to come to our home ... and bring us such pain .
there , good mother .
i mean no harm .
tell us , sir .
what is it you want ?
well , you see , the fosters have given me these woods in exchange for bringing young winifred back home to them .
i have the papers , all signed and legal .
gives me the rights to the forest and everything in it .
don' t be alarmed .
i' il let you stay here ... on my land if you prove cooperative .
cooperative ?
i want you to take me to the spring .
i don' t know what you mean .
don' t insult me , mr. tuck .
it' s immediately clear to me that the water' s powers have been wasted on ... unimaginative people like you .
i intend to make this fountain of youth , as the simpletons would call it available to those who deserve it ... for a price , of course .
you' il die of old age before i' il take you .
is that so ?
then , perhaps winifred will !
no !
jesse !
# #
yes !
bravo !
come now , winifred .
i' m feeling thirsty .
show me where the spring is .
perhaps i' il let you have a drink .
after all ... ... then we can spend ... eternity together .
winnie , winnie , come here .
it' s okay .
it' s okay , i gotcha .
pa .

winnie foster !

circle around to the right !
watch the water !

don' t let anyone get away !
jesse , come on .
winnie !

be careful of the girl !
winnie !

behind the house , men !

the hall clock chimed the hour .
outside , the wind was still .
everything , it seemed , was waiting .
we just want to understand what happened .
winnie ... try , please .
they didn' t kidnap me .
i was with them because i wanted to be .
she doesn' t know what she' s saying .
the tucks were kind to me .
they' re my friends .
if they didn' t kidnap you , why on earth did that woman club that man over the head with a shotgun ?
because mae tuck was protecting me .
doesn' t matter anyway .
that fella died .
it' s a murder charge now .
i didn' t much like the man but that won' t stop that poor woman from hanging .
miss is an eyewitness .
she' il have to testify .
oh , my god .
i figured you might want this .
doesn' t exist , far as i' m concerned .
i sure am sorry about all this .
good day .
thank you , henry .
# #
winnie .
jesse !
oh , it' s you .
i was afraid i would never see you again .
i need you to help me .
i need you to help us .
mae can' t go to the gallows .
she won' t die .
she can' t die .
they' re going to find out our secret .
we have to get them out .
help me !
please , help me !
somebody , help me !
please , someone help !
please !

all right .
help me , please !

# #

hell is upon you !
stop right there !
you' re under arrest !
# #

the boys are outside .

i' il shoot !
# #
my dear , sweet winnie .
what i wouldn' t do to keep you .
i wish you were ours ... for jesse .
for all of us .
you have to hurry and get away from here .
winnie ...
winnie , come with me .
there' s nothing for you here .
we can be together forever .
if she comes with us , they' il hunt us down .
they' il never stop looking .
tuck is right .
if i go with you it' il be too dangerous for all of you .
i can' t go without you .
you have to .
go back to the spring .
drink from it .
when it' s safe ...
i' il come back for you .
will you ?
i have to show you the eiffel tower , don' t i ?
1, 652 steps to the top .
winnie ... until we' re together again ... wake up with the dawn .
i will .
we got to go ... before it' s too late .
winnie foster ...
i will love you till the day i die !

she' s going fast but you can have a couple of minutes with her .
how are you ?
man : " ... and to almighty god
we commend the soul of our sister
and we commit her body to the ground .
earth to earth , ashes to ashes , dust to dust ...
... resurrection into eternal life
through our lord jesus christ ;
at whose coming in glorious majesty to judge the world
the earth and the sea shall give up their dead ;
and the corruptible bodies of those who sleep in him
shall be changed , and made like unto his own glorious body ;
according to the mighty working whereby he is able to subdue all things unto himself . " # #
mother ?
i was just wondering what it is about these woods you love so much .
mother , are you all right ?
i' m going to miss her , too .
oh ...
every time i look at you , you' re different .
i' m losing you , too .
i' m right here .
forgive me , winnie .
i just wanted to keep you my little girl forever .
# #
# #
go back to the spring .
when it' s safe , i' il come back for you .
what we tucks have , you can' t call it living .
we just ... are .
we' re like rocks stuck at the side of a stream .
the first weeks of summer were long over .
there was a feeling that the wheel was turning again ... ... slowly now , but soon to go faster .
winnie and her family left treegap to see the world .
she wasn' t certain what herjourney might bring but this much she knew ... it would be something of her own choosing .

for some , time passes slowly .
an hour can seem an eternity .
for others , there' s never enough .
for jesse tuck , it didn' t exist .
do not fear death , but rather the unlived life .
you don' t have to live forever .
you just have to live .
and she did .
