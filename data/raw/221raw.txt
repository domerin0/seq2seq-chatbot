welcome , people of nong pradu .
welcome , all who came for the presentation of robes to our revered ong bak , which is our mind and soul .
this ceremony is a prelude to the great festival of ong bak that will commence here in seven days .
and it will be an important ceremony , which is held just once every 24 years .
it marks the auspicious completion of two cycles .
prosperity will be in our community .
where' s the buddha amulet ?
it shows signs of wear .
the head' s slightly chipped .
hardly perfect condition .
200, 000 baht is a good price .
why won' t you sell it ?
come on .
name your price .
don , it' s not for sale .
i' ve come all the way from bangkok .
i took time off work .
i never told you i' d sell it .
i' m keeping it for my son , humlae , for when he is ordained as a monk for ong bak .
when you decide to sell , call me .
no .
no way .
i don' t have a telephone .
i' il give you my address .
when you decide to sell , write me a letter .
isn' t it nice , grandma ?
i want to give it to ting when he' s ordained .
nice .
he was born during the ong bak festival , wasn' t he ?
well , if you say so .
ting had an unfortunate start in life .
he was left at a temple when he was a baby .
a monk happened to see him .
he took pity on him and looked after him .
perhaps he is fortunate and he is protected by ong bak .

i have taught you the art of muay thai , and passed on the knowledge .
now i ask you never to use it .
is that clear , ting ?
yes , master .
good .
it' s good that you didn' t understand .
am i right ?
in his youth , your master learned the ancient art of muay thai under the great master kru dam .
the master , he was impatient to try out his skills .
in a rope fist fight , he killed his opponent .
overcome with guilt , he decided to become a monk .
muay thai is dangerous .
he doesn' t want you fooling around with it .
is it clear now ?
if you' re still not convinced ...
come .
fight with me , ting .
uncle !
you vandals !
what are you doing ?
move it !
that scumbag don severed the head of ong bak !
he also stole the poor box , master .
don is such a devil !
wicked man .
if we can' t recover ong bak' s head , our village is doomed !
everybody , calm down .
we' il find a way to bring the buddha' s head back before the great ceremony .
but who will bring it back ?
i' il bring it back !
i know where don lives .
the fate of the whole village lies in your hands .
this sacred amulet contains nilapat herbs .
my grandfather told me it belonged to kru dam .
keep it close to your heart .
here' s don' s address .
and please give this letter to humlae .
ting , be sure to bring ong bak back ... safely home to our village .
here' s some money for food .
all our hopes go with you .
mother gave me this ring before she died .
warn , take care of grandmother .
everybody , give what you can .
for the journey .
bangkok

hold on !
i haven' t got my fair share .

serves you right , you fool !
obvious , isn' t it ?
i messed up , smarty pants ?
peng has given me three days to pay up or he' il come after me .

they revere him .
you wasted your time .
it' s a lousy lump of stone .
you' re such a jerk !

your boys keep letting you down , huh ?
and now pearl harbour' s going to get the kamikaze treatment from my boy ali .
haven' t got any money yet .
i' m trying to get it for you .
i don' t want your money .
i can find it myself .

you seem very sure of that .
if you think your guy can win , up the stakes !
whatever .
i have no limit .
don' t argue .
you never understand me !
you asshole !
why do you have to act like this ?
muay , you' re not my mother !
it' s because you' ve got no parents that you' re such a loose cannon !
