my dissertation my paper
sir .
professor
my paper
i believe you
after we stopped last time
i felt a spiritual presence here
but i couldn' t get near the other dead woman before .
she' s inside ?
lf so , it' s a sign
when we die , the soul separates
lf the soul becomes lost and wanders we don' t know what can happen
so then it' s not the person' s fault right ?
i think so .
but how do we know ?
we never really know
can you help us ?
i can' t
what do you mean ?
you' re our only hope
you' re not the one who has to see them
it' s so frightening
you' re right .
it' s not easy to deal with
i just hope nothing happens
but if something does k
what do i do by myself ?
you fool !
where are you now ?
why is this open ?
sir , headquarters what happened ?
what' s going on ?
i don' t know
let' s go talk it over
are you ok , so hee ?
could you take me inside ?
i' m sorry so hee
i' il be ok
i' il get you some medicine
at the time when the train crashed i wasn' t scared at all
i think it' s cuz mom was holding me so tight
we should have died with her don' t you think ?
life is like a train ride
our final destination is death
the first car gets there to and so does the last car eventually
forget about it , hee joo
we waited so long for today
i love you
why can' t i see ?
train crashed .
250 people dead
bereaved family members cry over the death of loved ones
why was enginemam oh jong hyun in the control room ?
train wreck cleared , trains run again
departure times brought forward from 12 to 11 : 50
do you remember what so hee said to us ?
how she felt a strange sensation
when the train stopped until we took off again
we stalled for 10 minutes right ?
we' re almost at the next station
maybe the ghost train
and we merged at that time
you asked about jin sook
we were seeing each other
that night we had a stupid argument
that was the last time i saw her
when she was taken hostage
i don' t want to think about it
after tonight , this train will be put to rest
we have to stop the train now .
so hee' s disappeared
mi sun !

i really do
so hee , are you ok ?
