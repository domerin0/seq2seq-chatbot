25 . 000
all right .
in ten minutes , they will be overhead to drop in reinforcements .
we haven' t got enough firepower to cover them .
they' il be slaughtered before they hit the ground .
get back on the radio and warn them off .
all right , sir .
merle !
check the radio .
right .
the poor devils will be here in a few minutes .
so what the hell can i do ?
colonel !
over there , three o' clock .
but just one plane .
tell them to cover the drop as long as possible .
i' il be in the forward trench .
hey , cover the drop !
cover the drop !
cover them over there !
cover the drop !
cover them !
cover them , over there !
plane coming in , cover the drop !
cover me !
get that case of medical supplies , mahidi .
i' il help major de clairefons .
stay still .
i' m okay .
esclavier !
we' re in a minefield .
don' t move !
all right , follow me !
i want to get his i. d. card and papers , sir .
who' s he ?
general melies ' aide de camp .
melies should have come here himself , or put a bullet through his head .
all right , follow my path .
i' ve checked these over , sir .
there' s nothing restricted among them .
personal papers of major andr de clairefons .
you keep them , captain .
don' t you think i know why clairefons was here ?
what are you saying ?
one stinking plane .
what the hell did you expect to accomplish ?
melies sent his fancy aide de camp to check up on me .
you' re wrong .
am i ?
what was your job at headquarters ?
division historian .
and for your information i' m also a paratrooper .
you know melies couldn' t have picked a worse place to fight !
were you and clairefons going to report that ?
like hell you were !
you were going to make me the goat .
you were sent to get the general off the hook .
then you' re a damn fool !
sir .
none of us were sent , sir .
we volunteered with major de clairefons .
i need fighters , not historians , boot lickers from the general staff ...
shall we put him under arrest , colonel ?
no .
maybe he is a fighter .
captain boisfeuras .
i have got 30 porters with about 40 cases of ammo with me .
they are waiting outside in an old trench .
how did you get through ?
i persuaded my porters to keep going .
i speak their language .
i was born here .
shall i bring in the ammo now ?
sure .
we' il try to fight our way out before it gets light .
soldiers of france , you are going to die .
you will not be able to stop our oveewhelming force .
our soldiers are smaller and less strong than yours ... ... but they fight with more spirit because we have the truth ... ... the only truth , on our side .
you' il fight to keep humanity in the dark .
we serve a just cause .
our only desire is peace .
take off your badges of rank .
to hell with them .
they' il stick the biggest pig first .
you are in war of imperialist conquest in a country which does not belong to you .
french soldiers , you are a few beaten men against a division .
lay down your arms .
here they come !
so you want to play ?
esclavier , get the men moving !
move out , come on , hurry !
so you live a couple of days longer .
eat a couple a more meals .
sleep with a couple more women .
what difference does it make ?
halt !
what' s he saying ?
he told them their victory at dien bien phu is a great turning point in history .
he' s right .
history , my butt .
it was a military foul up .
no , it was the coolies that licked our white man' s army .
men willing to march 300 miles from the delta to deliver ... ... ten pounds of rice to their army .
you think the coolies fight for freedom ?
no .
it was fear that kept them going .
it wasn' t fear at all .
they want a change .
any kind of change .
i don' t blame them .
you are algerian ?
i am a french officer .
dien bien phu is also a victory for arabs under the heels of the french .
come , ride with me in the jeep .
come , you needn' t feel any solidarity with the french .
they will never accept you .
i prefer to stay with my comrades .
bravo !
push the jeep .
you have ten seconds to obey my order .
nine , eight ... ... seven , six ... ... five , four , three seconds ...
come on , boys , let' s push the jeep .
sorry .
i slipped .
come on , give a hand .
you boys push .
all right , one , two , three , push !
halt .
line up as you were .
all right , boys , as you were .
because of your attitude ... ... you and your comrades will now be punished .
so , you are the paratroopers .
the professional warmongers .
you will now go to prison camp where you will be taught ... ... the truth until the armistice .
armistice ?
hey , armistice !
silence !
the armistice will be long in coming .
the imperialists do not want peace .
remember this day well , colonel raspeguy .
may 8 , the day of your defeat .
we shall see how tough you are .
march .
what the hell is he saying ?
he says he congratulates our government on finally recognizing the truth ... ... and signing the armistice .
he hopes we have learned the errors of our ways , which he doubts .
in view of our repressions in algeria .
ask him how much farther to the french release camp .
just down the road .
look at him .
you' d think he just spent three months on the riviera .
but for raspeguy , none of us would be here .
he kept us together , he kept us alive .
true .
historian , i suppose you' il be sending in that report to the general staff .
i told you , that was never major de clairefons ' mission .
get that through your thick peasant skull .
basque peasant .
use my correct title .
to hell with you .
there it is .
orsini , let' s get in shape .
attention !
come on .
let' s get rid of this junk .
yeah .
halt !
now , we must be sure that everyone is properly processed ... ... and that each man' s documents are placed in separate folders .
some welcoming committee .
welcome back , colonel raspeguy .
what is the monkey cage for ?
that' s the decontamination centre .
before you leave we have to run you through there .
now see here , colonel , orders are orders , my dear fellow .
all right , my dear fellow .
boys !
this way home .
through this pigpen .
i' m sending in the report .
i surrender !
i surrender !
don' t kill me !
when do we get to algiers ?
tomorrow .
what have you all got ?
next stop , marseilles .
cards ?
three .
two for me .
do we get 30 or 60 days leave ?
thirty .
i' m not sure yet .
i' il take four .
four ?
yeah , four .
do i have to go to france , one please , or can i start my leave in algiers ?
you can get off at algiers .
i want you to come to my house and meet my family .
then we go to a place in the casbah .
colonel raspeguy .
that way .
halt , " monsieur " .
there' s a curfew tonight .
all passes have been revoked .
that does not apply to us .
we are back from indochina .
it applies to everybody .
we wouldn' t want to find you with your throat cut by the wogs .
don' t call them wogs .
this officer is an arab , and that' s the " croix de guerre " ... ... he won in indochina .
apologies , lieutenant .
may i see your papers ?
these days we don' t see many of your people in our uniform .
let this one through .
and you there , escort him home .
look .
it' s a bad situation for you here .
why don' t you come to paris and spend your time with me ?
thank you my good friends , but i' m staying here .
this is my home .
the courage of your friends gives you strength .
goodbye .
the courage of your enemy does your honour .
come in .
come in .
they' ve slapped a curfew on ...
read that on the table .
regiment disbanded .
i' ve lost my job .
what can i do to help ?
anything .
tell you what , you can get me another drink .
maybe i should write that report after all , what you did out there ... ... what they owe you , what we all owe you .
hey , come on .
you should see the countess de clairefons in paris .
and give her her husband' s papers .
it will mean a lot to her .
she can help you .
she comes from an important military family .
since when do women run the army ?
it' s been going on for longer than peasants have been allowed ... ... to become officers .
to hell with it .
bastards .
lousy bastards .
thank you .
my son .
mother .
father .
my son .
aicha .
do i call you " doctor " yet ?
no .
welcome back .
ben saad .
i knew you would be here .
we planned a party for you ... ... but the curfew has stopped the guests from coming .
ben saad took a risk running over from next door .
where is chaib ?
we hoped he was down at the dock to meet you .
i' m afraid your little fool of a brother is out breaking the curfew .
halt !
halt !
stop !
you' re talking about a handful of fanatics .
always had them .
but there' s been a revolution here since dien bien phu .
a yellow skinned army beat the french .
many moslems believe we could do the same .
i wish chaib were here .
mother , be careful .
last week during a curfew a woman was shot putting out her cat .
you still teaching them how to pull teeth , ben saad ?
no .
i wasn' t asked back to university this fall .
how' s business , father ?
fair .
we need new buses but i can' t get the permits for them .
and when do you become a doctor ?
in another two years , if i don' t quit first .
they shot him .
chaib !
my son !
put him on the table .
on his stomach .
what happened ?
we were writing slogans on the wall .
a patrol came around the corner .
is he bad ?
it' s pierre raspeguy , it' s the colonel from indochina .
he has an american car .
a gift from the army .
hey , where is mother ?
home .
she came to early mass .
we are all proud of you .
what' s there to be proud of , fernand ?
your brother is a pirate and you' re a smuggler .
and these border crossings must stop .
now , i' m warning you , fernand .
well , here you are , pierre .
of course , you managed to arrive late for mass .
to miss the service but still be seen by everyone .
he hasn' t changed .
come on now , pierre .
tell us .
what was it like out there ?
well , it wasn' t a holiday , i can tell you .
here , i want you to have this .
no .
come on , take it .
it will remind you to come back to your homeland and settle down .
thank you , father .
when are you going to algeria , pierre ?
we' il talk some other time .
my family have a big farm in algeria .
they have been there 100 years .
i have to see my mother .
i may be a colonel , but she' il hit me with this if i report late .
pedro , i liked you better with your moustache .
remember , fernand , this smuggling must stop .
so , you' re still smuggling tobacco ?
i' ve added whiskey .
but the customs patrols are getting tougher .
i' il go with you next time .
show you a few tricks .
it was generous of the army to give you such a fine car .
it' s rented .
from marseilles .
four years and you still haven' t fixed this bridge .
look .
so there you are , you big good for nothing .
all the health i have given you , and you' re not even a general .
i should have stayed a shepherd .
they have taken away my command .
cavalry club in the " bois de boulogne " .
unfortunately , these days ... ... certain great traditions of the french army are being forgotten .
as a result , we have been wounded in our flesh , and now mourn gallant men .
the tip .
major de clairefons belonged to a great military race of crusaders ... ... marshals of france , and generals of the republic ... ... which he surely would have become .
clairefons died in the tradition .
i was pleased to learn you' re the division historian .
the man who writes the history of the division will write about my husband .
i' m sure you' il be satisfied with what i say .
what i wanted to talk to you about ...
when may i see what you write ?
i' il work during my leave .
that' s good of you , captain .
the army needs men like you .
it needs men like colonel raspeguy far more .
i hope you' il use your influence to help him .
raspeguy is a peasant .
the army must resume its traditions .
i' m sorry i can' t help raspeguy .
he should resign .
you might as well tell him to shoot himself ... ... in the tradition .
nice of you to come , colonel .
how do you do ?
i wanted to offer my condolences in person .
thank you .
your husband , he was ... ... well , it wasn' t his fault the way he died .
i thought you' d like to know .
my husband' s place was on the general staff .
those who fight , and the others .
the paratroopers fight .
he became one of us .
i brought you his paratrooper' s badge .
paratroopers are nothing but adventurers .
i refuse to believe he seriously became one of you .
i' m sorry .
i thought it might comfort you .
it really wasn' t his .
it' s an old one of mine .
my mistake .
now there is a fighter' s face .
you take him out of those fancy feathers , put him in battle fatigues ... ... he could almost be a paratrooper .
he happens to have been one of napoleon' s generals .
really ?
i bet he sent home a lot of loot ?
that chandelier , for one thing .
when they took venice .
colonel .
yeah ?
i didn' t mean to be so rude .
that' s all right .
i' m still not myself .
sure .
i understand .
it was kind of you to tell me that lie .
i wish you luck in getting a new command , colonel .
i' d rather rely on tactics , with strong reinforcements behind me .
well , is there any way i can help you ?
now that you mention it , countess ... ... i could use some elite troops like you on my side .
i thought that maybe ...
colonel , mr. deguyot will see you .
colonel raspeguy , sir .
sir .
when my niece asked me to see you , your name was already known to me .
thank you .
lovely lady , the countess .
in this ministry , the issue is whether you should be given ... ... another command or asked to resign .
i will never resign , sir .
that' s up to you .
i have some questions to ask , unofficially , of course .
please sit down .
thank you , i prefer standing .
it' s a habit i developed as a shepherd boy .
general melies complains that you disobeyed his orders at dien bien phu .
several times , sir .
the first time in order to recapture a hill .
second time ...
never mind .
general melies seems to have a point .
yes , sir , and they got the hill .
next , there is a story you had some trouble at the release camp in indochina .
i acted in order to protect the pride of my men .
they wanted to disinfect us like animals in sheep dip .
i see .
here is a complaint from the customs department .
did you really help to smuggle contraband over the border ?
yes .
it' s a tradition of my village and my family .
during world war il , we smuggled french soldiers .
then the criticism of you is valid .
yes , sir .
the only thing in your favour is a report from captain esclavier ... ... the division historian .
in it he speaks highly both of you and my niece' s late husband .
esclavier is a fine scholar , sir .
and a shrewd one .
we can' t accept his estimate of major de clairefons ... ... without accepting as equally true his estimate of raspeguy .
please , sit down .
no , thank you .
he says , among other things , that your junior officers and men ... ... respect you in the field .
it' s your superior officers with whom you can' t seem to get along .
no , sir .
and that is to stop .
yes , sir .
if i' m going to help you .
help me how , sir ?
the command of the 10th parachute regiment in algeria may be open .
i' il take it , sir .
failure in this command is the end of your career .
the only reason you are being considered at all ... ... is because the situation in algeria ... ... is growing worse .
can i take my former officers with me , sir ?
lf they are fools enough to volunteer .
no one is assigned to the 10th .
it will be composed mostly of rejects from other units .
could you be ready in ten days to report to the 12th military district in algeria ?
yes , sir .
good luck , raspeguy .
thank you , sir .
i' d rather rely on tactics .
by the way , sir , who' il be my commander in chief in algeria ?
general melies .
thank you , sir .
why did you want to come here anyway ?
i don' t know .
i guess i' m just testing myself .
your uncle said i might be leaving for algeria soon .
will you be taking your band of pirates with you ?
the 10th is on a volunteer basis , except for the rejects .
but with a little arm twisting , i' il get my men back , all except one .
important ?
well , questionable .
but a good officer .
he' s an arab .
arab ?
named mahidi .
that may create an impossible situation for you .
i cabled him anyway .
of course , he refused .
the cable ...
it' s been a couple of days and i still haven' t heard from him .
it' s a waste for you to be a widow .
my mother was one at 22 .
well ... ... do we pass the test ?
good morning .
good morning , countess .
what on earth are you doing ?
breathing exercises .
this develops your wind .
you know , that' s all warfare is , a question of wind .
is it a beautiful morning ?
beautiful .
clean , cool country air .
two days in any town and i start to choke .
why don' t you live out here ?
the place needs a new roof , plumbing , and it would cost a fortune .
the last one to live here was my grandfather , a hero at verdun .
verdun .
that was senseless butchery .
they should have attacked in small groups ... ... well dispersed , 30 yards between each man .
to hell with verdun .
come on .
let' s dance .
natalie , if i come back from algeria a general ... ... will you marry me ?
you' il never be a general , pierre .
you' re a beautiful animal of war ...
look , never call me an animal .
a beast then , a beautiful beast of war .
but generals are a different breed .
why ?
because they' ve been to schools i haven' t ?
and read a few books ?
i' ve been learning on the sly .
this time i come back a general .
victorious , all covered with new scars and new medals ... ... which no woman could resist .
we' il put a new roof on this pile of stones ... ... be married in a village church .
we' il have a great ball for all the top brass , the bastards .
you' re talking like a peasant boy .
i' il bet you the next one is 32 and blonde .
right ?
here she comes .
50 !
next one , 22 and pretty , right ?
right .
a guy .
have another with me , sergeant .
sure .
hey , colonel .
merle .
you' re getting soft .
hey , you look fit .
i work out with the rugby team .
i' ve been running around myself .
hello , colonel .
hey , boisfeuras .
you look like an executive .
i am .
i have an arrangement with an italian sports car company .
i have a penthouse , and an office with beautiful italian secretaries .
let' s sit down .
hey , where' s esclavier ?
i sent him a telegram , care of headquarters .
where does he live ?
i couldn' t find out .
we are not in his social circle .
what' s the big news ?
i wanted see the gang before i took off .
where are you going ?
algeria .
you' re looking at the commander of the new 10th parachute regiment .
gentlemen , a toast .
you' re not going without me ?
you' ve got a wife .
that' s why i want to leave for algeria .
you didn' t put in a request for me , sir ?
it' s on a volunteer basis .
so , i' m a volunteer .
good .
the outfit won' t be the same without the old sergeant , colonel .
you' d leave all these bottles ?
i never touch it anymore , sir .
just an occasional glass with dinner .
here he is .
hey , esclavier .
come on , sit down .
just got the wire when i stopped by for the mail .
hello .
i also heard about your command .
congratulations .
thanks to your report .
sit .
what are you doing nowadays ?
i might work at a newspaper in lyons .
good .
you' re going to fight for our way of life behind a desk ?
no .
i' m going to fight for bigger and better refrigerators and washing machines .
those girls at the office are exhausting .
so .
yes .
i' d like to take a little vacation with you in algeria .
you' re on .
thank you .
all the boys have joined up .
would you like to make it unanimous ?
the way i see it , professional soldiers , stay in the army for personal reasons .
well , you got that off your chest .
so ?
i' d like to know what i' m fighting for .
not just fighting for the sake of fighting .
sure .
by the way , dia is joining us in algiers .
i sent mahidi a wire .
he didn' t answer .
as soon as esclavier leaves , i' il tell you the way i see the new outfit .
hey !
i hate to say it , but i need you .
you get no special treatment .
i' m asking you to come along as a fighter , not a historian .
don' t worry .
i' il take my notes in my own time .
okay .
come on .
you have 20 seconds to run from one end of the course to the other .
now , wait a minute .
i did it in 18 .
the machine gun will spray the course every ten seconds .
live ammo , sir ?
that' s right .
live ammo .
now you can take cover behind those sandbags in the middle .
now watch your timing coming out .
all right , let' s get rid of these chamber pots .
that' s a relief .
from now on , you wear these .
something funny , soldier ?
you look like a lizard .
every one will laugh at us .
maybe you' d better stick together , and learn to defend your sensitive natures .
esclavier ... ... you go first .
geoffrin , get ready to fire , every ten seconds .
go !
all right , you' re next .
i don' t feel well .
you don' t ?
how about you ?
no , sir .
i have a bad knee .
well , you men have been underrated .
you' re not just rejects .
you' re cowards .
i' il go .
there you are .
i' il go .
come on .
you' re next .
geoffrin !
get ready .
go !
sapinsky has been hit !
are you hurt bad ?
no , just a scratch .
tin soldier .
you never thought of shooting back ?
we didn' t know it was the rules .
don' t die .
all right ... ... go to the infirmary , for a shave from a pretty nurse .
you have cut me , captain .
i' ve taught you all morning how to come at a man with a knife .
if you get nicked it' s your own fault .
let' s try it again .
come on .
look !
sergeant verte .
what have you got in that canteen ?
water , sir .
pour some out .
what , sir ?
i said , " pour some out .
sergeant , you' re through with the paratroopers .
i promise i will stop drinking , sir .
okay .
but from now on nothing but water in that canteen .
yes , sir .
get back in line .
thank you , sir .
vanellie !
yes , sir .
you' ve got a bad record .
stealing .
you' re out .
sapinsky !
mugnier !
neuve .
fall out .
so you went into town and got into a brawl ?
yes , sir .
it' s because of these caps , sir .
and you got beaten up by gunners ?
yes , sir .
i' m throwing the four of you out of the regiment .
get out !
geoffrin , run her up .
this is the new banner of the regiment .
it is your banner .
present arms .
well , i gave it to them ?
yes , sir .
rest arms .
company dismissed .
you may have turned your men into street brawlers ... ... but i doubt if they' re soldiers yet .
depends upon what you' d call soldiers , sir .
i admit they wouldn' t make for fancy guards around headquarters .
look , raspeguy , if i had anything to do with it ... ... you wouldn' t be in my command .
yes , sir .
so don' t give me any trouble .
no , sir .
i' m ordering you to gafez immediately .
a strong band of terrorists is operating in the gafez sector .
the local mayor wants a military unit for protection .
do you have any intelligence on the band , sir ?
how big it is ?
what their equipment is ?
do they have any automatic weapons ?
no .
the mayor says they' re nothing but thugs and murderers .
your job is to find them and destroy them .
we' il need helicopters .
they' re in short supply .
the mayor has one .
he' il let you use it .
what' s my relation to the mayor , sir ?
you' il report to him in gafez .
he' s a politician , isn' t he ?
yes , an important one .
that' s all , raspeguy .
yes , sir .
we' re moving out immediately .
gafez .
kind of soon , isn' t it ?
very .
sir , we found out where mahidi lives .
you still want to go there ?
is it far ?
no .
practically on the way back to camp .
let' s go .
all right .
what happened here ?
anybody home ?
hey , colonel !
may i help you , gentlemen ?
who are you ?
dr. ali ben saad .
i' m a dentist .
i live next door at no .
6 .
this is no .
4 , belcourt place .
then you knew mahidi .
we were great friends .
where is he ?
after this he went away .
no one has seen him since .
what happened here ?
nothing so unusual these days .
the mahidis had a transport business .
but a close friend of the administrator owned the local taxi service .
mahidi was given a hard time .
fines , heavy taxes .
then he got an offer to sell out , at a low price .
he refused and this happened .
exactly .
where is this crook ?
not here .
he left with the civil administrator , who' s been promoted .
he' s now head of the entire district of nedromah .
if you see mahidi , tell him some friends from indochina were looking for him .
thank you , doctor .
halt all transport .
tell esclavier to bring the spaghetti .
captain , get the spaghetti .
what' s happening ?
i saw a land mine .
here , light it .
get out of the trucks .
everybody out of the trucks .
everybody out of the trucks .
everybody out !
get out from under those trucks !
take cover behind the ditch !
get out from under there .
take down the tailgate .
move !
pass out the ammunition .
come on , move !
get down the ammunition !
what do you see ?
nice job of concealment .
can' t tell how many there are .
they have automatic weapons .
i want that gun captured .
i want to know where it comes from .
i' il take a platoon in on it .
no !
you take a jeep .
they' il think you' re going for help .
double back .
right .
but keep them busy .
i' il try .
verte !
get boisfeuras .
boisfeuras .
see that machine gun ?
yeah .
attack it , but don' t come to grips .
nail it down .
i don' t want it disappearing on us .
understand ?
affirmative .
will do .
orsini , get that ?
clear .
company , advance !
and take cover across the road .
get ready .
advance 20 yards .
all units .
advance to the base of the hill and give it hell .
yeah , all right .
to the base of the hill .
and good luck .
get the machine gun .
thanks a lot .
get back !
all right .
it' s one of ours .
they' re using weapons captured from us .
makes them tougher than we thought .
what' s the count ?
eight dead , 22 wounded .
take them to algiers .
join us in gafez .
bring back sapinsky and his group as replacements .
these men died like donkeys , cringing under trucks .
that' s the worst place to be .
they died for france , sir .
captain , i know .
attention !
all right , load up .
everybody , out of the trucks .
now perhaps you' il realize my voice is heard in the right places .
i' il send them out to your farms at once .
before our crops get burned !
lf any more are destroyed ...
you' il be thrown out of office .
you' re late .
where' s the mayor ?
we expected you this morning .
were you having a picnic with the taxpayers ' money ?
hi .
welcome to gafez , colonel .
i think it' s best for you to ...
we were ambushed on our way here .
it' s best for you to break up your regiment into guard units ... ... and station them on the farms .
like hell i will .
what ?
we' re going into the mountains after that band .
i want your helicopter .
certainly not .
colonel , you were sent to gafez at my request .
we were caught because you reported they had no automatic weapons .
don' t talk to me like that .
colonel suspects that gun was stolen from your police arsenal in town .
keep out .
and you hushed it up to save face ?
you can' t prove that !
take the serial number .
we' il check it with quartermasters in algiers .
wait .
you have no right ...
we were attacked by trained soldiers .
they' re more dangerous than thugs and murderers .
what' s their strength ?
who' s their leader ?
we don' t know .
what do you know ?
this !
if any more farms are destroyed in the area , you' il be out of a job .
the settlers demand guards on their property .
we aren' t here to be night watchmen .
the band won' t be able to come down .
we' il have ambushes on every trail , block every pass .
not even a rabbit could slip through .
you made up a deal for yourself , trading this gun for a helicopter .
congratulations .
colonel , there .
black flag 3 , this is black flag 1 .
put a lookout on hill ...
409 . ... hill , 409 ... ... to work with the patrol on , on the southern slope .
got that , boisfeuras ?
head north .
my compliments , lbrahim .
because of you they know where to look .
who ordered you to ambush that convoy ?
i thought you' d be pleased .
i wanted to show that you taught us well .
you lost a machine gun , disclosed the direction of withdrawal ... ... and brought back no information .
they wore funny caps and boots , like yours .
paratroopers , but which outfit ?
my good friend the mayor in gafez ... ... he told me they were expecting the 10th regiment .
the 10th , i never heard of that one .
let me make a raid into town tonight and throw a few grenades ... ... to give them a welcome .
stop it !
my plan is that we hide out .
we must keep the french busy hunting us down .
do we stop fighting ?
no .
only sorties under my direct command will be made .
in five weeks time help is coming and this will turn the tide .
our people will rise up from one end of the country ... ... to the other and push the french back into the sea .
then , we' il give ourselves a treat with all their wives and daughters .
do you want to win your independence ?
do you want to feel the equal of any frenchman ?
then you will have to become soldiers ... ... real soldiers with discipline as good as theirs , better .
the trouble with you , mahidi ... ... is you still think you are in the french army .
ahmed , i' m ordering you back into gafez .
you leave now .
my time is running out in gafez .
i want to stay here .
you do your job .
you find out everything you can about those paratroopers .
now leave !
all right .
but promise me it is for the last time .
i don' t give promises .
i give orders .
sapinsky , if you see any rebels you' d better hide .
they' re tougher than those gunners .
yes , sir .
get me orsini .
black flag 4 , this is black flag 1 .
orsini , sir .
orsini , have you checked the village on hill 507 ?
yes , sir .
all secure .
we' re patrolling along the ridge now .
not a sign of life .
okay .
this is black flag 3 .
there is a fire on the plain about five kilometres from here .
merle .
give me the grid reference .
it is a 30 echo , 51 .
farm district .
look , leave geoffrin in charge .
take a few men and check the fire .
i' il meet you there .
affirmative .
will do .
here .
stand by the radio .
come on .
not even a rabbit could slip through ?
this farm was owned by the biggest landholder in the district .
there he is , his wife , daughter and son in law and three grandchildren ... ... their throats slit .
i' m ordering you to post guards on every farm in the area immediately .
after this , these land owners will take nothing less .
he' s right .
this is our fault .
how the hell did they get through ?
i' d stake my life that it wasn' t the rebels .
this job was done by the arab farm workers themselves .
they probably ran off to join the band .
you' re crazy .
then where are they ?
mayor .
yes .
where are the workers from this farm ?
i don' t know .
my interpreter thinks they were frightened off .
are you from this area ?
yes .
do the workers have relatives in gafez ?
i' m sure they do .
merle , round them up .
i want them questioned .
take this man to help you .
yes , sir .
colonel !
come on .
i want my helicopter back .
we' re back again .
are you walking us in circles ?
all this time , for nothing .
whose side are you on ?
i' m on your side .
but the trouble is they see me with you .
maybe i should go to the next place alone .
all right .
i' il give you five minutes .
wait here .
no , inside .
it' s safer .
come in .
i haven' t much time .
are the workers from the farm at rahlem ?
yes .
go to rahlem , i' m bringing four paratroopers .
i' il take the long way and be there in two hours .
does mahidi know about this ?
just do what i say .
it is my last job here .
but mahidi was given ...
don' t worry .
i' il explain to mahidi myself .
go .
he' s coming in now .
well , anything , anybody ?
not yet , but maybe something better .
what ?
they say there' s a dissension in the band .
the leader wants to defect .
who is he ?
a former french paratrooper .
this is not a good place to talk .
let' s go outside .
no .
right here .
where is he ?
they said he' s hiding out in rahlem .
rahlem .
is it far ?
no , i could take you there .
we' d be there and back with him by morning .
you should have seen mahidi tell that viet officer .
i prefer to stay with my comrades .
then esclavier refused to push the jeep ... ... and raspeguy stole the keys .
we had some time together .
sir !
lieutenant merle wants you to follow him in a truck to rahlem .
what for ?
we just came in from patrol .
please .
the interpreter says that mahidi is head of the terrorists but ...
impossible !
where' s the interpreter ?
i want to talk to him .
he went with them .
idiots !
no .
mahidi is quitting the terrorists , sir .
raspeguy is still out on patrol .
first company , first platoon , ready to move off .
here it is .
stop .
verte !
i' m worried about lieutenant merle , sir .
pass that wine around .
the night is on our side , don' t you think , sir ?
sapinsky !
my god .
first squad deploy .
everybody out of the trucks .
were they dead first ?
collect their dog tags .
they took them .
kill them !
do what they did to merle !
make them pay for this !
the ones who did this have cleared out by now .
how do you know ?
there' il be only women and children in the village .
don' t touch the women and children .
only the men and only with knives .
are you crazy ?
remember , only the men .
those with guns can at least defend themselves .
no one goes into the village !
i' m in command here and that' s an order .
if that was you , sir , all chopped up , we' d do the same for you .
we must avenge the mutilation of our three comrades .
go !
this isn' t vengeance .
it' s pointless slaughter .
you turn warfare into murder .
you stink !
load up .
i' il see that the bodies are buried .
no !
leave them .
maybe they' il be of some use .
use ?
this is the result of an act of treachery against the lizards !
tell the people at every village ... ... and every farm what happened here at rahlem !
now they' il know who we are .
murderers , we' re worse than animals .
don' t call me an animal .
next time i' il hit you , that' s a promise .
you were in charge of this mission .
colonel , i' m through .
no .
you' re not .
you have no place to go .
you signed up for keeps here in rahlem .
colonel !
colonel !
this woman knows where mahidi is .
where ?
mahidi !
next village !
the lizards are coming !
the lizards are coming !
we have information mahidi is here .
everybody outside !
mahidi is not here .
i swear it .
why is everybody hiding ?
they are afraid .
they have heard what happened at rahlem .
everybody out !
come on , move !
it' s mahidi !
it isn' t mahidi .
up there !
water !
come on !
why the water in the wine barrels ?
storage .
you store water in cisterns .
where are you sending it ?
where' s mahidi ?
where is his hideout ?
when the viets used that on my father , he lasted 20 minutes .
colonel !
colonel , i have something , sir .
he says mahidi is in djebal mab .
on the map here .
hill 409 .
load up and get going .
full strength .
i' il go ahead in the copter .
if i ever catch you using that filthy thing again ...
untie him and get out of here .
he was acting under my orders .
torture !
we came out here to win .
i should have killed you at rahlem .
pilot , we' re taking off .
we' re low on fuel .
come on .
by tomorrow every village in the district will know what happened at rahlem .
leave now , mahidi , before someone gives you away .
five more days , then we disperse to the aures mountains .
we will never make it .
disperse while we can .
every hour here counts .
others are on their way there .
enough for an army .
i did not expect to see you again , ahmed .
i would never abandon you , mahidi .
you disobeyed my orders .
i had to protect myself .
they found me out .
and if my plan is ruined by your stupidity ?
i' il make it up to you .
let me be one of your officers .
i see you already have a pistol .
it is for you .
from merle .
mahidi !
hey , captain !
it' s coming this way , it' s not even searching .
someone talked .
keep four men here with us .
tell the others to disperse and meet at the aures mountains at jhaba fergien .
move !
yes , mahidi .
jhaba fergien .
congratulations , raspeguy .
thank you , sir .
and you too , captain .
mahidi' s band has ceased to exit .
of course , he' s still at large , but i' m putting in your promotion ... ... to full colonel anyway .
well , thank you , sir .
sit down , raspeguy .
and you too , captain .
this is just an informal chat .
i have to admit your method at rahlem worked remarkably well .
we' re not too proud about rahlem , sir .
no , thank you .
it' s an unpleasant side , but not from a military point of view .
the gafez area is pacified .
whiskey ?
no , thank you .
colonel , how would you like to bring your regiment into algiers ?
we' re fighting men , sir .
exactly .
we have intelligence that a shipment of arms was sent yesterday ... ... across the border from tunis to algeria .
we estimate it will take about ten days for the arms to be distributed ... ... and then there will be 500 bands .
that' s an army , sir .
and probably under mahidi .
but those arms are the important thing now .
we don' t know where they will be hidden ... ... but the terrorist high command here in town does .
you' il have the right to enter any house , day or night , without a search warrant ... ... hold suspects without trial .
if i may be permitted , sir ... ... isn' t that in violation of their constitutional rights ?
yes .
the same laws apply here as in france .
you' il be hamstrung by the courts and you' il have no help from the police .
look at your mission in algiers as a battle you' ve got to win ...
damn it , sir , that' s a job for the police , not for us .
we' re ...
you should be grateful for any job .
i' ve hushed up the incident at rahlem as best i can .
that' s why i' m promoting you .
but if paris hears what happened , you' re finished .
i was in charge of that ...
stay out of this .
i think we understand each other , sir .
when the population wakes up in the morning , they will find ... ... the 10th parachute regiment has invaded their city .
attention .
attention .
cards of identity will have to be presented before leaving the city .
the 10th parachute regiment ... ... is now taking command of the city .
those without papers must stay inside their houses until cleared .
no vehicle may be driven from the area without permit .
your identity card ?
go !
cards of identity .
identity cards .
cards of identity .
how about him ?
him ?
how about him ?
him ?
him ?
him ?
how about him ?
the battle of algiers .
we are making history , professor .
introduce me to your colleagues .
no faces , no names .
otherwise they end up dead in an alley .
i' m serious .
introduce me .
come on , esclavier , sit down .
no .
i want to see their stinking faces .
you stupid idiot !
they' re exposed now .
what a shame .
hey , little brothers !
what do you want ?
anisette .
you moorish whore , get back to the casbah .
didn' t you hear him , captain ?
don' t pay any attention to that idiot .
here , come and sit with me .
you' re asking a little moorish whore to sit at your table ?
please .
what will you have ?
whiskey , double , straight .
a light whiskey and soda .
my name is philippe esclavier .
i' m aicha .
no last name ?
arabs don' t have last names , do they ?
girl , do this .
boy , bring my drink .
coming , young lady , coming .
she didn' t mean you .
we were talking .
i hear you lizards have been killing peasants up in the mountains .
it' s a bitter war .
the algerians want independence .
the heroes of the french revolution wouldn' t be very proud of you .
you haven' t touched your whiskey .
i don' t drink whiskey .
i only ordered it to be fresh .
i' m very fresh .
i' m going to ask you to see me home in your jeep .
i' m a foot soldier taking a tour of algiers on foot .
i' il tell you what .
i' il show you the city , but then you must drop me off in a taxi .
okay .
you drive a hard bargain .
let me carry that .
in our country , arab women carry for the men .
and walk behind them .
shall i go first ?
no .
that would mean i' m your woman .
i take it the young lady is with you , sir .
that' s right , geoffrin .
i' m sorry , sir , you can' t go into the casbah .
you' re not armed .
if you can wait a moment , i will call a patrol to escort you .
please don' t bother .
i' il be fine .
aicha ... ... l' d like to see you again .
okay .
day after tomorrow .
same time , same place , captain esclavier , and thank you .
i' il take her .
she is busy .
there' il be more in two days , bakhti .
did you have any trouble getting past the guards ?
no .
i had a military escort .
the paratroop captain .
i think i' il be able to use him whenever i like .
good .
it' s best from now on that i stay at belcourt .
you' il be able to go between bakhti and me .
have you heard from my brother ?
no .
in three days , they' il receive the arms shipment from tunis .
then we' il have two fronts , the military with the guns ... ... the civilians with the bombs .
guns are better .
indiscriminate bombings kill the wrong people .
that' s too bad , but we must keep the paratroops busy ... ... until the arms are distributed .
there are enough detonators here to blow up half of algiers .
these are the delayed action ones .
one minute , three minutes , five minutes .
start .
stop .
eight bombings yesterday .
the day before , six , including a hospital .
it' s a diversion to keep us off the arms shipment .
where is esclavier ?
he' s been going around with a casbah girl .
haven' t you got one lead from those hooded monkeys ?
no .
but it would be a different story ... ... if i could look in a certain card file held by the police .
where ?
police headquarters , 3rd floor , room 447 .
but they won' t give it to us .
then seize it .
there' il be an awful stink .
you could get into trouble .
with luck we have about two days left .
get the cards .
come on , come on .
stay there .
get over there .
what' s this , captain ?
we' ve come to request your confidential card index system .
impossible !
hold on there !
we still want it .
and if i refuse ?
stop those men !
they have no right to ...
we' d assume you were covering up for the terrorists .
we' d consider you traitors .
and wipe you out .
the confidential files are in the first cabinet , there .
okay , verte , that' s the one .
come on .
i want it to be known i give way in the face of force .
be careful .
much obliged .
we' il have colonel raspeguy send a letter thanking you ... ... for your fine spirit of cooperation .
goodbye .
some swim .
i must get back .
it' s been a perfect day .
the water was lovely and warm .
we must go .
why the sudden rush ?
i have an evening class .
you didn' t mention it before .
didn' t i ?
where were you in indochina ?
saigon , dien bien phu .
the last stop , the prison camp .
i know arabs who were in indochina .
there were quite a few .
aicha .
no , philippe .
i' m not going to see you anymore .
it' s no good .
no .
then why did you come today ?
for a swim , but i' m way out over my head .
your pass .
it' s all right , sergeant .
the young lady is with me .
let her through .
yes , sir .
aicha ... ... i must see you again .
all right , tomorrow , right here .
these days sometimes it' s hard to get away .
where can i reach you ?
no last name , no address .
all right , tomorrow .
but don' t wait more than an hour .
half an hour .
mohammed yasem .
belonged to the u. m. d. a ... ... then became affiliated with various liberation organizations .
seeking self autonomy , and has been under surveillance ... ... and suspected for some time in collaboration .
well ...
are arab women better lovers ?
that' s my business .
it' s also mine when you go messing around with casbah girls .
they' re all dangerous .
don' t see her again .
that' s an order .
shove it .
look !
confine yourself to quarters .
i' il talk to you later .
hey , listen to this one !
has always been active in the nationalist movement .
five years imprisonment at lambese during world war il .
twice arrested since then , but released for insufficient evidence .
who' s that ?
recognize him ?
ali ben saad , 6 belcourt place .
known to frequent 22 rue de la bombe .
i didn' t know you handcuffed prisoners of war , colonel .
yes , when they' re not prisoners of war .
then turn me over to the police .
we are the police .
you' ve forced this sort of thing on us .
now talk .
where is mahidi ?
i refuse to answer any questions .
we' re gong to find everyone in these files , just as we found you .
now , someone is going to talk , sooner or later .
it might as well be you .
send for my lawyer .
i stand on my legal rights .
have you seen this , colonel ?
that' s a radio .
yes .
look .
and that' s nothing , sir .
it can be made ten times as strong .
are you going to use that thing on me ?
i' m going to get that information from you ... ... or the rest of these , one way or another .
take him in the back room .
and keep him quiet .
come in .
we picked them up at 22 rue de la bombe .
some house .
a pimp , this old hag , and these two tarts .
she is my fiance .
i demand a lawyer .
keep your hands to yourself .
keep the rest in the hall , except this one .
colonel , this man molested me in the courtyard , 20 francs worth .
she planted her claws in my cheek .
come here .
sit down .
that' s a fine watch .
i' il make you a present of it .
since when do little tarts from the casbah have cartier watches ?
i found it .
and the paris dress , did you find that , too ?
get your dirty hands off me .
how do you think they plant their bombs , sir ?
with their prettiest girls all dressed up to look like europeans .
i' m going to report you to captain ...
captain ?
captain who ?
maybe he was a colonel .
take off your clothes .
orsini !
call esclavier .
and send in her fianc .
what is your name ?
marie antoinette .
take your fiance in your arms .
kiss her .
come now .
i heard you arabs were passionate .
harder !
you show him how , here !
sir .
aicha !
is she the girl you' ve been going with ?
that' s right .
she probably works for ben saad .
here , take a look at this .
she was picked up at 22 rue de la bombe .
aicha , come upstairs to my office .
now he' s in it up to his neck with the rest of us .
she' s trying to pass herself off as a prostitute .
let' s talk to the rest of them .
you !
stand up !
booby trapped .
he tried to get away .
question the others .
you .
yusseff .
what happened , sir ?
anybody killed , colonel ?
what was it ?
the files are gone .
what is your connection with ben saad ?
you get the information .
i' il give you five minutes ... ... then i' m handing her over to boisfeuras .
now ... ... let' s get this over with .
that captain boisfeuras stole my watch .
be sensible .
tell me your real name and address .
then i' il take you home .
look , professor , swallow your pride and admit what i am .
i sell myself .
what' s more , i like it .
just because i wouldn' t sleep with you , you have to think i' m a lady .
now , i know you' re lying .
yusseff spilled his guts .
he' s spouting names faster than we can take them down .
he says your girlfriend is very important in the network .
ask her what she was carrying in her beach bag .
a false beard .
what were you carrying in that bag ?
detonators .
and she used you to get them in and out of the casbah .
who are the others ?
stand up .
stand up .
answer my questions .
hands up !
hands up .
who' s he ?
brother bakhti .
he ran the bomb factory .
take him over there with the group leaders .
that makes it a clean sweep .
all 16 of them .
we' ve disposed of the last bomb .
the city is clean .
where are the arms hidden ?
under the most intensive questioning not one of these people knew .
i' m convinced that only ben saad could have told us .
well , then we' re finished .
there is a chance , maybe the girl .
colonel raspeguy , sir .
as provost marshal of the 12th district , i' m serving you with this subpoena .
what for ?
legal proceedings are being instituted against you .
you will leave by military aircraft for paris at 7 : 00 .
like hell i will .
they' re investigating the incident at rahlem .
my compliments , colonel .
the general sends his regrets .
well ?
she is mahidi' s sister .
hey , that' s a break .
does she know where the arms are ?
yes .
where ?
she told me .
on one condition , we don' t kill mahidi .
where are the arms ?
i promised her we wouldn' t kill mahidi .
is it a deal ?
i' ve been subpoenaed to return to paris .
the politicians are after me .
but they can' t fight success .
i' il either be a winner or i' il be dead .
i could have you shot .
you won' t know afterwards .
it won' t take me ten minutes to get what i want out of her .
get him out of here .
with your permission , colonel .
get out !
get out .
where' s mahidi ?
only if you take him alive .
it' s a deal .
he' s somewhere here , in the aures mountains ... ... with all they' ve got .
he' s moving out tomorrow with a well equipped army .
and what about her ?
i' il send her to paris .
they can deal with her .
come on .
go to hell , without me .
come on .
we have work to do .
mahidi !
mahidi !
it' s a french column .
take your positions .
take your positions .
take cover .
take cover .
mortars , wait for my signal .
raspeguy' s men .
now ?
no .
let' s see if they stop .
halt .
now !
open fire !
get out !
no , disperse !
open mortar fire when ready .
get boisfeuras .
boisfeuras listening .
boisfeuras .
do you see that temple up there ?
you come in from the right .
with caution .
i want mahidi taken alive .
all right .
orsini , did you hear that ?
send a platoon in from the left .
first platoon .
moving on the left of the temple .
you know where that base is ?
a damn tough place to take .
i can see the crates of arms .
hey , look ... ... to the right of the tree .
it' s like shooting game .
verte .
over here with the radio .
verte has been hit , sir .
what ?
do you see boisfeuras ?
no .
colonel !
what ?
boisfeuras has gone crazy .
his men will be cut to pieces .
boisfeuras !
come in , boisfeuras !
boisfeuras , come in , boisfeuras .
orsini !
meet me at the first aid station , with a squad .
okay .
esclavier , come on .
come with me .
climb aboard .
come on , hurry .
all right , boys .
come on , move .
all right , take it up .
my pipe !
we' ve been wiped out , sir .
we should withdraw .
we' re going up this mountain until every man falls .
and then i' il go get mahidi myself .
look , sir .
no , stop it , stop firing !
it' s carrying their wounded .
remember your promise .
relax .
get back there !
stand and fight .
mahidi !
esclavier , here .
mahidi !
surrender .
mahidi , here !
boisfeuras , no !
you didn' t have to kill him .
you didn' t have to kill him .
you dirty ...
esclavier .
boisfeuras was right .
he' s a good soldier .
we won , didn' t we ?
i pity you and your victory .
esclavier , shut up !
you may get a general' s star and a countess out of ...
i said , shut up .
but you' ve turned into an animal .
thanks .
you just broke my chains .
