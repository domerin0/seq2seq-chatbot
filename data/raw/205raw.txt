a fire claiming three lives in the south bay yesterday ... ... is believed to have been deliberately set .
the south bay is plagued by a series of fires , all of a similar nature .
authorities believe arson' s involved .
they have no suspects yet .
jazz composer edward barla was privately eulogized today .
he was known for tunes " midnight hearts " and " just for you .
edward barla , dead at 56 .
the trial of lou janero has ended .
samantha walker has the story .
the jury has found ... ... lou janero guilty of murdering paul cirela .
cirela , part of janero ' s organization , was testifying against janero ... ... in an upcoming trial for bookmaking and tax evasion .
assistant d. a. , thomas mcsherry , credited inspector harry callahan ... ... for his part in the successful prosecution of lou janero .
great credit should go to inspector callahan .
he put janero out of business .
the inspector' s evidence not only implicated janero in the murder ... ... but provided the means to file more charges against janero ... ... for bookmaking and gambling .
samantha walker , channel 8 .
back to you .
get off my ass .
he' s going .
did you recognize any of the attackers ?
is this attack connected to the janero trial ?
has janero put out a contract on your life ?
were these janero' s men ?
have you received death threats ?
is the department protecting you ?
the department will issue a statement ... ... as soon as we' ve conducted an investigation . $13, 453 . 63 .
that' s the price of an unmarked squad .
it' s the third car you trashed this month .
lou janero .
what ?
his men shot the car .
send him the bill .
see how funny it is behind a desk , because you' re off the street .
all this for a car ?
lieutenant ackerman' s request .
it' s for your own good .
if you think i' m gonna  just until we handle janero .
he' s in prison , but clearly calling the shots .
literally .
our hero can' t be turned to swiss cheese before the commendation .
see ?
you' re getting a commendation .
swell .
we must take advantage of the press you' re getting .
how do you propose to do that ?
it' s my opinion that you should work with me in public relations .
opinions are like assholes .
everybody has one .
you don' t know what you' ve done for our image .
you just put a major crime figure in prison .
you' ve got a high visibility right now , and for once , it' s positive .
you know what that means for recruitment ?
look at this copy we' re getting .
we' ve never been this swamped for interviews .
i' m not some dog and pony act .
we must maximize your public relations value while we can .
getting close and personal with reporters isn' t my job .
your job is promoting our positive image .
how positive would it be if i resigned , lieutenant ?
don' t misunderstand me .
harry , all i' m asking for is a little cooperation .
we don' t have to pull you off the street completely .
just be cooperative with the press .
anything else ?
yeah .
quan , will you come in here ?
quan' s moving from the youth gang task force to homicide .
good , homicide can use a cop with al' s experience .
i' m glad you agree .
if you remain on the street , quan will watch your back .
now hold on  that' s final .
that' s swell , being that most of my partners end up hurt or dead .
ask al how he feels about it .
well , quan ?
any objections to working with callahan ?
i think i can handle it .
get a bulletproof vest , kid .
teaming harry with a chinese american is good for our image .
you have any kids ?
me ?
no .
lucky for them .
cut .
cut !
you' re out of sync , johnny .
what' s the problem ?
where is that fool ?
jeff !
jeff !
we' ve had a short , peter .
trust me , " you said .
right ?
did he say that ?
that means " fuck you " in this business .
i checked it .
i' ve got a backup head .
give me 20 minutes .
all right , do it .
and no cock ups .
and that goes for the rest of you morons .
this sucks , man .
how can i sing with shit exploding all over ?
it was an accident .
this whole movie' s an accident .
how did i get talked into this shit ?
you need a video .
i need this scene for the film .
we' re getting what we want .
why aren' t we shooting on a warm sound stage , instead of a meat locker ?
it' s cold so the audience can see your breath when you sing .
brilliant .
not original , but people will know i froze my ass off .
what' s that mean ?
a director with talent would shoot something original .
instead of ripping off the exorcist .
this is not a rip off , it' s a homage .
you stupid ....
jesus , i don' t believe you .
what ?
you' re hurting , aren' t you ?
what do you mean ?
you promised not during shooting .
i know what i' m doing .
i can handle it .
you won' t fuck up my film !
i' il handle it !
just let me go back to the trailer and get it together .
then we' il kick some ass .
okay ?
okay .
can i get a coat ?
get a coat , please , for johnny .
now what ?
don' t worry , he' s a trained seal .
throw him a fish , he' il perform .
rise and shine , boys .
time to get up .
what' s happening ?
i always knew working homicide would be glamorous .
i mean , meeting celebrities and all .
too bad you can' t get his autograph .
you know , harry , they always die in threes .
when a celebrity dies , two more go in a week or two .
it' s a fact , harry .
celebrities die in threes .
this one has crystalline around his nose and mouth .
scabs up and down both arms .
fresh puncture marks on his left forearm .
yeah , homicide can be really glamorous .
check the dummy out , please .
meagan .
i want a three inch lens , very tight .
try not to drop it .
let' s hurry up and shoot this and wrap this up .
my second assistant and i found johnny in his trailer .
he was just lying there .
at first we thought it was a joke .
but then ....
when did you last see him alive ?
a half hour before that .
he went to his trailer while we set up .
was he alone ?
i don' t know .
he was alone when we found him .
tell me , does anyone on your set use drugs ?
we don' t do drugs , callahan .
we do film .
what people do is their own business .
if it doesn' t interfere with my film , i don' t give a shit .
was squares using ?
how should i know ?
he had agents , lawyers , friends .
it' s their job to deal with his drug problem , not me .
well , that' s a very caring attitude .
what do you want , callahan ?
drugs were his trademark .
his career was singing about them .
it made him controversial .
i can see why you' d want him in your flick .
it was a marketing decision .
johnny sells tickets .
you know , bums on seats , love .
and we needed a video tie in .
any idea who was supplying him ?
no , but if i hear of anything , i' il call you first .
marvelous .
check on anyone who dealt with squares .
whether the cast , crew  inspector callahan .
inspector .
shit .
is it true that johnny squares od' d ?
we' re conducting an investigation .
right as we speak .
nothing' s been
thank you , inspector .
excuse me , are you suzanne dayton ?
what' s going on ?
johnny ?
johnny ?
hold it .
i' m sorry , step back .
no , johnny !
there' s nothing they can do .
you' il make yourself sick .
hold on , could we give her a little air ?
out of the way , please .
off with that camera .
i' il film what i want .
keep shooting .
this is someone' s heartache .
right in here .
what are you doing ?
give me that .
smart .
high and dry is the kind of mindless film comedy ... ... that' s come to typify summer films aimed at the youth market .
the humor is of the locker room variety .
audiences seeking more sophistication need to look elsewhere .
the producers
rock star johnny squares died this afternoon .
samantha walker filed this report .
johnny squares was found dead at the royal meat company ... ... on location of the film hotel satan .
the cause of death isn' t known , but squares had a history of drug use .
he was arrested last july for possession of heroin .
his songs were allegedly based on his drug experience .
what' s that all about ?
my past catching up with me .
as a kid , i was in the gang that hit him up for money .
all my life , i' ve been involved with gangs in one way .
i figured i' d come over to homicide for something different .
it' s different , all right .
call for backup .
get the fuck out of here .
hurry up !
move it !
put your money on the table !
hurry up !
don' t move !
don' t fuck with me , lady !
come on , guys , hurry up !
you forgot your fortune cookie .
what ! ?
you' re shit out of luck .
get out of the way !
teaming up with a chinese american is good for the department' s image .
who was he ?
some guy in the wrong place at the wrong time .
dean madison was his name .
does it ring a bell ?
never heard of him .
well , he knew you , harry .
i found this in his pocket .
it' s a list of celebrities .
tony engelhart , linebacker .
michael cipriano , race car driver .
and one inspector harry callahan .
johnny squares is on that list .
see what' s by his name ?
yeah , r. i. p. " rest in peace .
you know what this is ?
it' s a bill for a tv camera and lens .
i said stop wrecking cars , not destroy something else .
they interfered with an investigation .
don' t give us that .
is this your media cooperation ?
cooperation works two ways .
what is it you have against reporters ?
some of them are just marvelous people .
some walk through a pile and track it through an investigation .
you better change your attitude .
unless we reach an agreement with them ... ... it' il cost this city 2 million , and your career .
join us , please .
ms. samantha walker of station kwsf .
captain donnelly .
ms. walker .
captain .
and this is inspector  callahan .
we' ve met .
yes , of course .
won' t you sit down ?
ms. walker ... ... lieutenant ackerman tells me you have a proposal to make ... ... regarding the accidental damage to
there was nothing accidental about it .
the department has something to say about it .
although the camera was destroyed , i have the entire incident on video .
i see .
and your proposal ?
we' il be willing to drop the lawsuit against the city ... ... but that depends on inspector callahan .
the inspector would be willing to  what do you have in mind ?
dinner .
i owe you an apology .
you were right the other day .
i had no business intruding on that girl' s grief .
i get too eager sometimes .
in my rush to get the story , i made an error .
we all make those sometimes .
no , i should have known better .
i' m sorry .
let me ask you , miss walker  sam .
sam .
do you like cops ?
as long as their not in my rear view mirror .
why ?
what are we talking about , other than the damaged camera .
oh , no , no , no .
i' m letting the insurance company deal with that .
and i think i can be persuaded to drop the lawsuit ...
... but i want something in return .
oh ?
what would that be ?
i want your story .
what' s that ?
i' ve done my homework on you .
you' ve had quite a colorful career .
look at this .
you see ... ... there' s a lot of interest in the janero case ... ... and the cop who put him in prison .
channel 8 is doing a special on organized crime in the bay area .
but what i' d like to do is an in depth profile ...
... of you , inspector harry callahan .
sorry , i' m not interested .
why not ?
this latest attempt on your life by one of janero' s men
you' re not interested in doing a story on me .
you want blood .
that' s what sells
now wait a minute  no , you wait a minute .
you people are interested in death and mayhem ... ... and you don' t care how you get the story .
that is not fair .
that' s not the kind of journalism i do .
to you i' m just a cop with a price on his head .
i don' t like people saying they' il kill me .
or journalists using it as a way to increase ratings .
what i was asking  that' s the end of the story .
sorry .
the coroner' s report last night said that squares used speedballs .
cocaine and heroin ?
that' s not what killed him .
he used an inhaler with a new designer drug .
a synthetic form of heroin .
you mean something along the lines of china white .
only a thousand times more powerful .
he went into immediate respiratory failure .
what i' m trying to figure is why' s a guy like that ... ... using synthetic junk when he' s got the real stuff ?
maybe he didn' t know what he was using .
harry .
harry ?
sorry about that .
get you next time .
check the cast and crew for prior drug busts .
i' il see if narcotics has dealers moving synthetic heroin .
harry , there' s something you should see .
a story to be published in today' s tribune ... ... reveals that director peter swan and people involved ... ... in hotel satan were playing the game called " the dead pool .
sources say the object of the game ... ... was to pick eight bay area celebrities ... ... who' il die by a predetermined date .
the winner was to possess the list with the most dead celebrities .
what makes this story significant ... ... is that rock star johnny squares was on director swan' s list .
although swan would not comment ... ... we have confirmed that there was such a game ... ... and swan' s production accountant , dean madison , was also involved .
ironically , madison died yesterday ... ... in a tragic holdup that took place in chinatown .
no man is master of the breath of life so as to retain it ... ... and none has mastery over the day of death .
for the lord of all shows no partiality ... ... nor does he fear greatness ... ... because he made the great as well as the small .
and he provides for all alike .
and the dust returns to the earth , as it once was .
and the life breath returns to god , who gaveth .
my condolences .
mrs. dayton , i' m terribly sorry .
suzanne , i' m very sorry .
thank you .
my sympathies .
do you mind , gentlemen ?
i happen to be at a funeral .
i' d like to talk about your list .
it' s no big secret .
the cast and crew knew about it .
the dead pool is just a harmless game .
it sounds pretty sick to me .
let me tell you something .
people are fascinated with death and violence .
that' s why my films make money .
they' re an escape , a vicarious release of fear .
same thing with this game .
nobody takes my films or the dead pool seriously .
someone gave squares the drugs that killed him .
maybe you .
you can' t tie me to johnny' s death because of a coincidence .
my assistant and effects supervisor played too .
why not talk to them ?
we will .
but nobody on their list is dead yet .
johnny was a drug user and i predicted he' d die this year .
that' s all .
the idea is to pick celebrities who won' t make it ... ... because they' re old , sick or in a high risk profession .
like police work ?
nothing personal .
i don' t like being on your list , swan .
that' s what this is really about , isn' t it ?
if you have a choice
maybe i' il start my own pool and put you on it .
are you threatening me ?
if you want to play the game , you' d better know the rules , love .
that' s our report .
i' m patrick snow .
i' m samantha walker .
thank you for being with us .
tune in tonight for a report ... ... on chemical dependency among celebrities .
who they are , why they do it ... ... and the price they pay .
tonight at 11 .
good night .
and we' re clear .
thought i' d seen the last of you .
i saw your report yesterday .
we confirmed it with people in the game .
vicky owens , swan' s assistant , and effects supervisor , jeff howser .
it didn' t occur to you to clear it with us first ?
i had to go with the story .
the papers got the same tip .
i had to get the story out fast .
or someone else would get it first ?
something like that .
how were you tipped ?
by mail .
a copy of the dead pool and a letter explaining it .
it' s already started .
what has ?
all the media bullshit .
newspapers print the dead pool and it hurts our investigation .
what bothers you ... ... is that we found out about the dead pool first .
you people take janero and the dead pool , add hype and distortion ... ... and innocent people get hurt .
aren' t you overreacting ?
i' ve seen it happen .
i don' t like the hype , either ... ... but it happens when reporters compete for a story .
why don' t you start thinking about your responsibility to the public ?
you can' t kill the messenger because of the message .
i' m sorry , it wasn' t my intention to screw up your investigation .
here' s the list .
now , excuse me .
thanks .
it seems i owe you one .
dinner , that is .
i was offered a job as an anchor at this small local station .
because ... ... i was first runner up in miss colorado .
colorado ?
we' re right over here .
but i had absolutely no experience , just my bachelor' s in journalism .
but it was a way in , so i grabbed it .
but i didn' t just smile at the camera and read copy .
i did anything and everything at this station .
sports , news , hard news , weather .
i produced documentaries .
i love san francisco .
but it isn' t easy .
big city , big news .
i had to prove myself all over again .
have you succeeded ?
somewhat .
apparently not with you .
i shouldn' t complain .
at least you stayed for dinner this time .
i' d still love to do your story .
no , thanks .
you' re wrong about me , callahan , and what i want to do .
i wish i could convince you .
i' il tell you what .
let' s think on it .
sounds fair .
thank you .
it' s the truth , i don' t care what you say .
hey , callahan .
you' re callahan , aren' t you ?
that' s right .
what can i do for you ?
you' re the cop who put janero away .
all i want is your autograph .
can i shake your hand ?
i' d just like to thank you .
it' s about time somebody did something about janero .
could you sign it to chester docksteder ?
that' s me .
let me buy you a drink .
some other time .
we need more cops like you .
that' s what we need .
i gotta change my shorts .
what are you laughing at ?
this is your 15 minutes , callahan .
andy warhol said everybody' s famous for 15 minutes .
well , this is it .
swell .
was it your first autograph ?
yeah .
and i hope my last .
you know something ?
i don' t think lou janero likes you very much .
she' s okay .
just a little shaken up .
how' re you doing , girl ?
whatever they' re paying you , harry , it couldn' t be enough .
my colleagues .
i don' t want to be the news .
let' s get you out of here .
you sure you want to see this guy ?
yeah .
here' s your animal .
hicks .
what the fuck do you want ?
i brought you some cigarettes .
and what would i have to do for you ?
nothing .
just stand where i tell you .
stay right here .
fifth cell down .
that' s the trouble with this prison .
they let anybody in .
i don' t like scum like you trying to kill me .
sounds to me like this dead pool thing is making you a little paranoid .
oh , yeah .
i heard about it .
good news travels fast .
big fucking media hero .
hero today and gone tomorrow .
call off your guns .
what are you talking about ?
your trouble is , you have too much time on your hands .
what you need is a job .
a what ?
a job .
i' m gonna give you a job being a postman , understand ?
it' il be your job to see the mail gets through .
see that gorilla down there ?
that' s butcher hicks , and he' s killed three men .
you know how ?
he tore them apart with his teeth .
never found all the pieces .
he has an unhealthy appetite .
so what ?
so hicks there is my new pen pal .
i' il write him once a week ... ... about how i' m looking in on his sick mother ... ... and trying to get him special privileges here .
and the interesting part is , if anything happens to me ... ... and hicks doesn' t get his letter ... ... he' il be really pissed off .
and he' il come to see you ... ... because you' re the mailman .
he' il probably come down here and cancel your ass like a stamp .
you better ensure prompt , courteous delivery .
and pray nothing happens to me .
that' s it ?
that' s it .
see that dirtbag i was talking to down there ?
he says smoking can cause cancer ... ... and anyone who smokes as much as you do is one dumb son of a bitch .
fire !
cut !
cut !
cut .
where is that stupid fuck ?
howser !
get your ass down here .
you' re supposed to harpoon the goddamn dummy .
the tide shifted .
the tide shifted .
the ocean' s incompetent , not you .
this is the third time this week .
you' il never work for me again .
there' s a bunch of reporters down there .
come on , come on .
can we ask you a few questions ?
please !
i' d like to say one thing .
in light of what' s happened ... ... perhaps playing the dead pool game isn' t smart .
any tie between the dead pool and squares ' death ?
none whatsoever .
next question .
mr. swan , will the game continue ?
no , we' re filming a nightmare sequence at the shipyards ... ... and we' d like to forget this and get on with our job .
johnny would have wanted it that way .
first squares died , then your production accountant was killed .
is hotel satan cursed ?
people can believe what they want , but nothing ....
nothing will stop me from making this film .
end of interview .
whatever you want , money , credit cards , just take it .
ever notice how time slows down at night ?
just like in my films .
a dream world .
shut up !
i can' t hear the colors .
i' ve got to hear them .
that' s the mark of a good director , you have to hear the colors .
you' ve gotta be able to taste the sounds .
i have a heart condition .
a critic with a heart .
that' s a laugh .
do you like my films ?
i said , do you like my films ?
who are you ?
you know who i am .
i don' t .
i don' t know you .
god ... ... what kind of a film critic are you ?
shadows of the dead !
hell without the devil !
night of the slasher !
peter swan .
brilliant , love .
what do you think of my films ?
give me your honest opinion .
i like them .
liar !
the entrance is through the sliding glass door .
she wasn' t sexually assaulted .
killed sometime last night .
maid found her this morning .
do you recognize her ?
molly fisher .
famous movie critic .
on a scale of 1 to 10 , 10 being the best ... ...
i' d have to rate this one an 8 .
harry , we found this .
thanks .
dead pool .
molly fisher' s also on peter swan' s list .
oh , god , it' s coming !
those are just some of the highlights of peter swan' s films .
the typeface is the same as those sent to the papers and tv stations .
and the neighbor saw a man exiting molly fisher' s condo last night .
mid 20s , wearing a black jacket .
i want swan in custody now .
it doesn' t feel right .
doesn' t feel right ?
every celebrity on this list called in the last couple days .
they' re all screaming for police protection .
we don' t have the manpower to be 24 hour babysitters .
ackerman is whining about the negative publicity this case is giving us .
and your name is on this list too , callahan .
my gut feeling tells me swan is the best suspect we have ... ... so get his butt in here !
donnelly .
what ?
it' s for you , callahan .
we' il be right there .
wait a minute .
where are you going ?
to do my job .
i think we' ve got our man .
you all stay back .
everyone .
i' m gonna go up .
where' s the news crew ?
you better get them here .
i mean it .
now !
what' s up ?
name' s gus wheeler .
he says he' s the dead pool killer .
we found him like this .
he' s soaked in gas and threatening to set himself on fire .
why not hose him down ?
he says if he sees a fireman or even a garden hose , he' il torch himself .
what' s he want ?
to be on television .
he wants a cameraman and a reporter .
al and i will just pose as
it has to be someone he recognizes .
stay back .
stay back from me .
it' s gonna go up .
you hear me ?
better keep those people back .
you all right ?
not really .
stop right there !
that' s far enough .
i' m samantha walker from
i know who you are !
what do you want ?
is that camera on ?
you want to know why i' m doing this ?
because nobody cares .
we care , mr. whee
no !
nobody ever paid any attention to me before .
in order to get attention , you gotta do something .
well , i' m really gonna do something this time !
did you have anything to do with the deaths ... ... of johnny squares and molly fisher ?
no , i just said that so you' d listen !
i want everyone to see this !
i want everyone to remember me !
and to remember what i did here !
oh , jesus , harry , he' s really gonna do it .
that' s right , lady .
i' m really gonna set myself on fire .
and it' s gonna be on the news ... ... and then finally everybody will know about me .
about me !
gus wheeler !
no one' s gonna see you die .
what ?
i said , no one' s gonna see you die .
not if we stop filming .
you can talk to me and tell me your story ... ... but we won' t film your suicide .
what are you doing ?
turn the camera back on !
we' re not gonna film it !
we' re not .
she' s right .
you can set yourself on fire and we' il roast marshmallows .
but you won' t be on news at 11 .
you' re ruining everything .
give me the flare .
you' ve got plenty of coverage .
you think so ?
trust me .
okay .
harry , you okay ?
you hurt ?
no , i' m fine .
get that gurney over here , quick !
you all right ?
oh , god , harry .
this man sets himself on fire .
and it' s my fault .
it was an accident .
maybe if we' d have kept filming .
that' s exactly what he wanted .
what you did took guts .
most people would have gone for the exclusive .
reel three , george .
just a moment .
what is this ?
why the fuck are you harassing me ?
i was at a party when fisher was killed .
i was there until 2 , and i have witnesses .
we know that .
we checked .
somebody' s trying to make us think that you killed squares and fisher .
any idea who it is ?
are you kidding ?
it could be anyone .
they all hate me .
my former agent .
my producers , my crew .
the public .
they envy my talent so much they wish to destroy it .
you don' t believe me ?
talk to my secretary .
she' il show you the letters i get .
warnings , death threats ....
i get so many , i don' t pay attention anymore .
i' il check on it .
tell me ... ... anyone else have a jacket like this ?
most of my crew .
why ?
maybe it was someone in your crew , or who' s worked for you in the past .
whoever' s doing these murders uses your films and you as inspiration .
welcome to the nolan kennard show .
i say it' s out of hand .
it' s time we have guidelines for what we watch .
i don' t want big brother out there telling me what to read or watch .
what' s your opinion ?
anybody can watch anything ... ... as long as it doesn' t hurt somebody else .
take it easy .
give me a chance here .
who decides what' s harmful ?
isn' t that what we' re talking about ?
first johnny squares , then molly fisher , now nolan kennard .
like i said , celebrities always die  in threes , yeah .
at least the guy went out with a  a bang , i know .
what do you have , russ ?
hello , harry .
from the residue on the frags , i' d say plastic .
probably c2 or 4 .
we' il do an analysis back at the lab .
let me know the results .
you got it .
what' s that ?
i don' t know .
it looks like the wheel from a toy .
have you been questioned about nolan kennard ?
is his death connected to the dead pool ?
i don' t know .
is his death due to your list ?
i don' t know .
in hell without the devil ... ... a character' s poisoned .
night of the slasher has several stabbings .
we can guess what hotel satan  get to the point .
are there parallels between the deaths in your film ...
... and the death of johnny squares ?
that' s a stupid question !
do you feel any responsibility ?
you' ve blown this out of proportion .
you want to speak to somebody ?
speak to the police .
talk to inspector callahan .
he' il tell you i' m not a suspect .
i have nothing to do with these deaths .
that' s all i have to say , now sod off .
callahan !
you .
harry .
i think that' s about it for me .
what' s that tattoo ?
oh , that .
one of my grandfather' s superstitions .
you see , he painted these words on my back and chest .
it' s supposed to ward off anything that' s harmful or evil .
when he heard i was your partner , he figured i could use the help .
i was just trying to honor the old guy .
besides , i didn' t think it could hurt .
listen , i think i' m gonna go home .
i' il catch you later for a beer .
see him ?
i saw him .
he can' t be over there .
how y' all doing ?
you' re the last asshole janero sends .
wait , you got it wrong !
don' t fuck with me , buddy .
i' il kick your ass right now .
it' s not what you think .
janero did hire us .
but this ain' t a hit .
janero doesn' t want anything to happen to you .
we' re your ... ... bodyguards .
those letters all came from your files .
harlan rook . " god .
yes , i remember him .
every time i was at a film festival or a seminar , he was there .
mr. know it all , i called him .
he knew everything about my films .
to tell the truth , i found it a little unnerving .
what' d he want ?
he had this screenplay for a horror film he wanted me to direct .
he said it' d be the ultimate peter swan film .
he was crazy .
i couldn' t get rid of him .
finally , my attorney put a restraining order on him .
then what happened ?
i didn' t see or hear from him again .
that must have been over a year ago .
is he the one ?
the typewriter used on these letters ... ... is the same one used to tip us off to the dead pool .
call swan' s attorney and see what he knows about rook .
and run a dmv check on the address .
right .
it might not be a bad idea to start playing it a little safe .
maybe your granddaddy can paint me up .
look , i' m being serious .
don' t go where you normally go , not even home .
you can stay with me .
thanks , but i think i can do a little better .
price of fame .
is this what ackerman meant by cooperating with the press ?
it must have been one of those in depth interviews .
i got a lead on rook .
a psychiatrist who treated him .
good .
give it a try .
okay .
it won' t respond .
someone' s on my frequency .
forget it .
it' s just not working .
now what the hell is that ?
time' s up , callahan .
you all right , al ?
shit .
two fractured ribs .
he bled in the chest .
we drained it and set up an iv .
he' s lucky , the bulletproof vest he had on saved his life .
another of my grandfather' s superstitions .
when your partner gives you advice , take it .
harry .
this is dr. friedman , chief psychiatrist here at the hospital .
i' m sorry about what happened .
i feel somewhat responsible .
your partner contacted me about a former patient of ours .
harlan rook ?
yes .
at first , i didn' t recall the name .
i found the file today .
he was evaluated here a year ago .
the diagnosis was process schizophrenia .
multiple personality .
not exactly .
his sense of self hate was so strong ... ... that he no longer had any personality of his own .
consequently , he substituted identities ... ... found in books , films ... ... fan magazines .
identities with which he had love hate relationships .
he wasn' t dangerous enough to hold ?
most mentally ill people are not violent , inspector .
by law , a person who poses no danger can only be held for 72 hours .
i' m sorry , this is one instance where the system failed .
is this address recent ?
i assume it' s still the same .
samantha walker .
this is peter swan , ms. walker .
your coverage of my predicament has been thorough ... ... but my side hasn' t been told as well as it could be .
i see .
i' m prepared to grant you an exclusive interview .
are you interested ?
no doubt about it .
he' s our boy , harry .
explosives .
caps .
detonator .
it all connects .
harry , you gotta see this .
talk about obsession .
looks like he had a real peter swan shrine going here .
i' m not sure .
i could have sworn i put it in my bag .
but i' m not sure .
bob , do you have my little mike ?
it' s in your bag .
thank you .
look at this .
i' il call the tv station .
samantha went out to the shipyard to interview peter swan .
swan doesn' t know anything about it .
what' s this ?
a payroll stub .
sundown security , made out to ed butler ?
i don' t get it .
that' s the company that provides security for swan' s locations .
ed butler may be an alias for rook .
where are you going ?
harry ?
harry !
that' s my car !
yes .
that' s the shot i' m iooking for .
what is it you want from me ?
you' ve got it wrong , love .
this is what you wanted .
an exclusive interview .
but you' re not swan .
shut up !
you don' t know !
you don' t know !
i know who i am .
do you know who you are ?
do you ? !
yes .
all those films he made .
those are my nightmares , not his !
every night i dream , and somehow he reads my mind .
he stole my thoughts .
he put my thoughts on film , and he takes all the credit .
he can' t get away with it .
he has to pay .
he stole my nightmares and made them real .
so i stole his dead pool .
i' il play his game and make it real .
he can take credit for that .
drop it , rook .
you didn' t die , callahan , so i had to find another celebrity .
you' re next .
shoot me , callahan .
maybe you' il get lucky .
maybe my muscles won' t contract and drive this knife into her throat .
let her go .
first the gun .
drop it and kick it over to me .
time' s up .
what' s it gonna be ?
what the fuck ?
you' ve locked yourself in , asshole .
yeah .
just you and me , asshole .
the gun , callahan .
now !
no !
he' il kill us both !
oh , god .
you let me down , mr. famous fucking cop .
you let swan get away .
you' re the killer , not swan .
i should' ve killed you first .
that was my big mistake .
now kick it over to me .
harry , don' t .
think you' re smart , don' t you ?
callahan , you son of a bitch !
i' m gonna kill you slow !
do you hear that , callahan ? !
stay in there .
callahan !
come on out , callahan .
there' s nowhere left to run , callahan .
don' t make me come in and get you .
the game' s over !
you' re out of bullets .
you know what that means .
you' re shit out of luck .
where' s rook ?
he' s hanging out back there .
inspector , was this another hit attempt by janero ?
is it connected to the dead pool case ?
