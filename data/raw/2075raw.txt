i have to figure things out .
how many people are in this thing ?
why not ?
holy cats .
holy , holy cats .
you alright ?
mister ?
worth !
don' t worry .
i hit my head .
let me take a look at that .
i' m a doctor .
it doesn' t look bad .
what the hell are you doing ?
hey , did you hear what i said ?
motion detectors .
into the walls .
tough to spot .
oh god , oh god , oh god .
wait a second .
let' s all just relax for a minute .
perogies .
i was eating dinner .
i don' t know .
you ?
leaven ?
i , i just went to bed and ...
what about you ?
i just woke up here .
who ?
then what is it ?
i don' t know .
aliens .
let' s rule out aliens for now and concentrate on what we know .
my mom' s gonna freak .
i won' t be there .
she' il freak .
what do you think , rennes ?
all right , i tend to agree .
shouldn' t we wait here ?
for what ?
what about you ?
look around .
take a look .
i got a feeling it' s looking at us .
it' s a nightmare .
leaven .
we can do this .
we' ve to be calm and work together .
you' re a cop ?
boot it !
clean .
it sounded closer .
it' s mechanical .
it seems to come at regular intervals .
maybe it' s the ventilation system .
no vents .
no kidding , i' m boiling .
what is it ?
serial numbers ?
room numbers .
they' re different in each room .
they have to feed us , don' t they ??
holloway .
suck on it .
keeps the saliva flowing .
what ?
the air seems dry in there .
why didn' t the boot set it off ?
the boot' s not alive .
detects hydrogen sulphide of the skin .
renn .
not renz .
it' s french .
fine , you' re french .
how you ...
he' s the wren .
you' re kidding , right ?
you don' t have to think about nothing that' s not in front of you .
merde .
get him out !
oh my god !
it was electro chemical .
and he missed it .
the wren .
great !!
we' ve to reassess this place .
forget about all that !
you can' t have answers in here !
just look at what' s in front of you .
that' s what he said .
we all have a role here .
leaven , what are you ?
nothing .
i just go to school .
what else ?
there' s nothing else .
i live with my parents .
i' m boring .
one down , four to go .
what' s your purpose , worth ?
often wondered that myself .
i can' t stand that attitude .
because he' s right .
what' s your purpose , quentin ?
kids , three of them .
i haven' t made my peace yet .
nice , nice
i' m not giving up !
i' m pissed off .
they came into our homes !
they took my ring , they took ... ... oh , my amethyst .
i wanna know who' s responsible .
your glasses ?
you don' t need them ?
they' re for reading .
what can they mean ?
149 .
prime numbers .
i can' t believe i didn' t see it before .
see what ?
645 , 645 ...
that' s not prime .
372 ... no .
649 ...
that room is safe .
the incinerator room was prime 083 .
you remember all that in your head ?
i have a facility for it .
leaven , you beautiful brain .
boot it .
okay , out of the way .
brains before beauty .
safe , safe .
prime numbers !
oh , how long have we been in here ?
nine or ten hours .
how do you know ?
five o' clock shadow .
last thing i remember was shaving .
you got a date .
doin ' good .
i need to smoke .
i' d smoke a butt off a sidewalk .
talk then .
have a conversation .
what kind of doctor are you anyway ?
you know , the free kind .
she didn' t either .
she' s not dead , we' re separated .
these numbers aren' t prime .
okay , clear .
excuse me , sorry .
no , i couldn' t .
this one' s trapped too .
we have to backtrack ?
not yet .
read them to me .
it' s stuck .
look out .
this room is green .
holloway ?
hi there .
this room is green .
yes , it is .
i wanna go back to the blue room .
what is it ?
shock or what ?
i think he' s mentally handicapped .
i like the blue room .
jesus christ .
he almost broke my neck .
butter first , then honey , kazan .
how' d he survive ?
i wanna go back to the blue room .
there' s lots of blue rooms .
we' il find you another real soon .
this is too bizarre .
go on .
i' il look after him .
let' s not make him do the climbing thing now .
holloway ...
hol lo way .
what are you talking about ?
at least he' s good for something .
free clinic doctors ?
you know what the establishment is ?
just guys like me .
they don' t conspire , they buy boats
this place is .. remember scaramanga ?
it' s a rich psycho' s entertainment .
is that what you think ?
clear .
gas !
holloway , get back here !
it' s ok .
i just swallowed my button .
i hate this .
i hate this .
it' s like cramming without coffee .
she needs a break .
she can do it .
they don' t look like prime to me .
is that your two bits worth , worth ?
for what it' s worth .
well ?
well , he' s right .
not prime .
stop !
in front of you !
what is it ?
shut up !
quentin , hold still .
leave the boots .
shut the fucking door !
how would he know ?
so he has a bad attitude .
this makes a spy of him ?
he doesn' t like red rooms .
so what happened ?
maybe they mean nothing at all .
well , we need to rest anyway .
are they telling you anything ?
they' re no tarots .
they don' t reveal themselves at once .
they' re like people .
oh , gross .
well , he' s just peeing .
jesus christ .
now it totally reeks in here !
do you find this pretty funny ?
what' s your fucking problem , worth ?
even holloway is better than you .
jawohl , kommandant .
and that somebody has to be you .
not all of us can play nihilist .
not all of us like to play hero .
this is a will to live .
a will to live .
the warm feeling deep inside .
thanks .
i' m a new man .
poor worth .
nobody loves me .
do it .
thought so .
fuck you quentin !
you think we matter ?
we don' t .
you' re not getting out of here !
yes , we are !
no , you' re not !
yes , we are !
there is no way out of here !
gotchya .
how do you know that ?
answer the question , worth .
oh , god .
who are you ?
i' m the poison .
the shell .
the sarcophagus .
you built this thing ?
i was contracted to draw plans for a hollow shell .
a cube .
a cube ?
why didn' t you tell us ?
worth .
you' re lying .
was not at first .
who' s behind it ?
i don' t know .
who hired you ?
i didn' t ask .
i never left my office .
bullshit .
you knew from square one .
no .
that' s the way things work .
one doesn' t know what the other does .
the brain never comes out in the open .
whose brain ?
it' s the same machine !
you do a little job in your office ,
i was right .
all my life .
we gotta get out to tell the truth !
holloway , you don' t get it .
big brother is not watching you .
what kind of fuckin ' explanation is that ?
we have no idea what it is .
we know more than anybody else .
nobody wants to ask questions .
i worked for months on this .
it was a great job !
why put people in it ?
because it' s here .
you have to use it or you admit it' s pointless .
but it is pointless .
quentin .
that' s my point .
what have we come to ?
it' s so much worse than i thought .
not really .
just more pathetic .
you make me sick , worth .
i make me sick too .
we' re both part of the system .
it' s like you said , quentin .
let' s face it , the reason we' re here is that it' s out of control .
this is how we ruin the world ?
well , i feel better .
that' s why you stayed with us .
to confess .
quentin !
stop it !
stop it !
we need him .
what for ?
have you gone mad ?
worth .
hi .
so there' s this outer shell .
yeah .
where ?
wherever the door guy put it .
and it' s sealed from the outside .
what are dimensions of the outer shell ?
one hundred and thirty two square meters .
may i ?
come on , honey , slide over .
5 by 5 by 5 meters .
the inner cube can' t be flush with the shell wall , there' s a space .
one cube ?
i don' t know , it makes sense .
the biggest the cube can be is ...
26 rooms high , 26 rooms across , so
17 . 576 rooms .
seventeen thousand , five hundred and seventy six rooms ?
it makes me queasy .
descartes !
leaven , you are a genius .
what ?
what ?
coded cartesian co ordinates .
in english , slower .
these numbers are markers ,
like latitude and longitude on a map .
the numbers tell us where we are inside the cube .
well , where are we ?
it works .
all i have to do is add the numbers together .
the x coordinates is 19 ...
y is 26 rooms ...
so that places us ... ... seven rooms from the edge .
all right , let' s go .
holloway , i' m looking for solutions .
well , you haven' t found any yet .
we cut the risk with the numbers and the boot .
worth will go first .
no , he won' t !
we take turns !
relax .
room for two in there ?
what' s the matter ?
these coordinates .
14 , 27 , 14 .
what about ' em ?
they don' t make sense .
if there are 26 rooms across , no coordinate can be larger than 26 .
no , not outside of the cube .
that means we' re not having dinner .
trap .
trap .
trap .
trap .
trap !
trap !
sound activated .
lovely .
how come the sound of the door opening didn' t set it off ?
must be rigged to ignore it .
the edge is surrounded by traps .
i say we cross the bitch .
right !
how many boots do we have left ?
get it off him .
we know how it works .
we just have to be quiet .
that' s pretty fucking quiet .
i' m glad you' re on side , worth , ' cause ... you' re up .
he' s unpredictable .
we' il come back for him .
but he' s a risk for us .
am i right ?
shame on you .
will you look at yourselves ?
what have you turned into ?
that' s all we got left .
we' il come back for him .
that' s a lie and you know it .
he' il be quiet .
no .
you go out , i' m here .
this way .
you fucking fuck !
let him go right now !
let him go , you nazi !
what did you call me ?
quentin , let that innocent boy go .
you listen to me , woman .
you' re always crying for something .
i know your type .
no kids , no man to fuck you .
so you go around outraged , sniffing their business !!!
you missed your boat , holloway .
you' re all dried up inside there .
that' s your fucking problem .
how dare you say that to her ?
you don' t know her , quentin .
none of us know each other here .
oh , i do .
no you don' t .
no wonder your wife left you .
all that bottled up anger .
and a thing for young girls .
god help you , quentin .
did you smack your kids around too ?
open it .
door number six ?
net number one ?
door number two ?
open the fuckin ' thing .
oh , sunshine .
night time .
my old friend , the shell .
it' s there .
morning !
hang on to me .
i can' t see anything .
nothin ' to hang on to .
we gotta try something .
let' s see if the door' s over there .
someone has to swing over there .
swing ?
we make a rope out of clothes .
i' il tie it around myself .
i' il go .
i' m going , holloway .
she' s right , you' re too heavy .
i' m the lightest after leaven .
anyway , it' s my turn .
a couple of months .
i am .
david .
helen .
you' re such a helen .
that' s as far as you go .
there' s nothing down here .
hold tight .
i try swinging over there .
okay , one more time .
hurry , you' re getting heavy .
what the hell' s going on ?
get up here now !
quentin !
have you got her ?
she ... slipped .
shhh ... come on .
kazan .
will you please stop doing that ?
you got to be strong , sweetheart .
don' t even talk to me .
we gotta get down to the bottom .
a long way with only one boot .
but we' ve to do it before we get too weak .
you gotta keep cracking the numbers .
it' s your gift .
it' s not a gift .
it' s just a brain .
all right .
one hour .
an hour is as long as i say .
what are you doing ?
we have to reach the bottom .
it' s quiet there , you can concentrate .
you want to leave them ?
they' re traps , leaven .
believe in me !
try and see how my mind works .
i can read people like an x ray .
i looked through the walls .
i saw him working on this .
we' re the purpose .
the cube ... ... is us .
we fit .
like numbers .
a man and a woman .
two halves of the equation .
i take you down , the perfect key .
i slip you into the lock .
leaven , it' s time to go down .
get away from her .
they' re fuckin ' spies .
holloway knew about my family ...
you dropped her .
just go , quentin .
give us the boot , you pig !
you don' t want the boot .
you want to came with us , worth ?
down the hatch .
what the fuck' s with him ?
how did ...
it' s , it' s , it' s the wren .
it' s the old wrenster .
how could ...
we' ve been going around in circles .
that can' t be .
where are we ?
i don' t know !
where are we ?
you figure it out !
guess you were right , worth .
there is no way out of here .
get away from me .
wasn' t rennes killed in that room ?
how come there' s nothing out there ?
it' s the edge .
fuck off !
oh , that was good .
what difference does it make ?
we' re dead anyways .
of course .
the rooms ?
it' s the only logical explanation .
i' m such an idiot !
the numbers are markers , points on a map , right ?
right .
permutations .
permu what ?
a list of the coordinates that the room passes through .
the numbers tell you all that ?
i don' t know ,
all i saw was what the cube looked like before is started to move .
okay , so it' s moving .
how do we get out ?
27 .
i know where the exit is .
where ?
you remember the room that had the coordinate larger than 26 ?
what about it ?
that placed the room outside .
a bridge .
what are you talking about ?
the room starts off as a bridge ,
so , when does it open ?
don' t .
that' s it !
this room moves to zero , 1 and 1 on the x axis .
2 , 5 and 7 on y.
and 1 , and 1 and zero on z.
and what does that mean ?
you suck at math ?
i need the room numbers around us .
666 , 897 , 466 .
567 , 898 .
and 545 .
did you get that ?
656 , 778 , 462 .
that' s enough .
x is 17 .
y is 25 and z is 14 .
this room makes 2 more moves before returning to its original position .
do we have time ?
maybe .
then let' s go !
you threw out our last boot .
can you calculate that ?
the numbers are huge .
i' d have to calculate the number of factors in each set .
maybe if i had a computer .
i' m not dying in a rat maze !
look at the numbers .
i can' t factor them !
even 5 , 67 !
it' s astronomical !
2 .
astronomical .
before that .
factor .
how many factors kazan ?
of 5, 6, 7 .
2 .
what , are you fucking kidding ?
how many factors does 30 have ?
3 .
how about 7 ?
1 .
gum drop .
i don' t have any gum drops .
gum drops .
gum drops come in bags .
ok in bags .
i don' t like the red ones .
898 .
2 .
545 .
2 .
he' s giving us the factors .
astronomical .
so this idiot would be a genius ?
by those numbers it should be safe .
only one way to find out .
don' t !
safe .
kazan , my man .
what' s the number ?
right here , look here !
make him do it !
kazan , we' re gonna do some numbers .
prime numbers .
and the factor of 656 ?
2 .
779 ?
2 .
462 ?
3 .
clear .
move !
let' s go .
you too , worth !
go !
worth !
563 !
please , kazan , 563 ?
you fuckers , you' re dead !
2 .
clear !
1 .
trapped !
check the floor .
is he dead ?
where is he ?
come here .
i said come here now !!
gotchya .
that way .
2 .
clear !
4 .
clear !
that proves our theory .
numbers .
423 .
clear .
listen .
he hasn' t moved far .
i' il go find him .
what do you think ?
you don' t have a lot of lives left .
i didn' t move .
i don' t like that .
14 , 26 , 14 .
worth , get back here right now !
deal .
this room' s going to the bridge !
we' re coming !
over here !
we don' t have much time .
this better be it .
it should be .
where ?
oh , no !
give me a minute .
be patient .
this is the room we started in .
the bridge .
red .
424 .
clear !
go ahead .
it' s not your fault !
what is out there ?
boundless human stupidity .
i can live with that .
get out through the door !
red , kazan !
a cube ... 26 rooms high .
26 rooms across .
17, 576 rooms ? !
fear
do you remember how you got here ?
paranola
i wanna wake up !
susplcion
motion detectors into the walls .
tough to spot .
desperatlon
we can' t get out of here .
yes , we are !
there is no way out !
we need to get around the traps .
prime numbers identify them .
i' m not dying in a rat maze !
no more talking , no more guessing .
the walls
what the hell is going on ?
are closlng in
we are the key ...
the cube ... ... is us .
