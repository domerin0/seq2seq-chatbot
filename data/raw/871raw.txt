the trouble with humor is that people think you must be joking
today , " tales of the swedish countryside "
takes us to the swirling rivers of the province of dalecarlia .
where able bodied men float lumber , the gold of the woods .
this is a job for real men !

good morning , mr dahlgren .
good morning .
how was your bowel movement ?
it was nice and firm .
have you slept well , gudrun ?
no , i have a terrible headache .
those are withdrawal symptoms due to a lack of coffee .
don' t forget our meeting .
there are only two guests this week , and you know what that means .
either we go bankrupt , or we' il have to go with the times .
we also need a new name .
something with a modern ring to it .
well , the name was good enough for dad .
we must be doing something wrong , we don' t have enough guests .

in the computer .
everything' s digital .

and more chickens , if necessary .
that sounds expensive .
we' re talking about an additional 300, 000 to 400, 000 .
for extra editing procedures .
can we really afford an ad campaign for three million kronor ?
bold moves for desperate times .
i hope you know what you' re doing .

the tokyo market was up three percent .
while frankfurt was down 2, 3 % .

the remote control is broken .
i' il do the vacuuming next week , but please pick the place up a bit .
she wasn' t really right for you .
bye , take care .
hi !
could you possibly give me a hand ?
i' d like to rearrange some stuff .
sure .
do you have a cat ?
a cat ?
no ...
i thought i heard a cat in distress .
maybe the sound came from upstairs .
i don' t think it' s right to keep cats in town .
this is how i live .
it' s nice .
what' s that ?
whales .
i like to meditate to their songs .
hear the heartbeat ...
it' s the sound you heard in the womb .
please give me a hand with the bed .
there' s some negative energy over here .
have you heard of feng shui ?
it' s about fields of energy , ley lines .
help pull the bed over here a bit .
that' s fine .
no , it doesn' t feel right .
there' s too much sha qi from that corner ...
east ...
no , it' s in conflict with my kuan number .
let' s have another go at it .
pull it towards you .
be careful , now .
this feels good ...
it' il work if i put a bagua in the corner .
what' s your sign ?
no , don' t tell me ...
you' re a taurus , aren' t you ?
you move like a taurus .
what date ?
may 5th .
the fifth day of the fifth month , what a surprise !
that means you' re a romantic that likes to be in the spotlight .
i don' t know about that ...
thanks , please accept a photograph of your aura .
put your hand right there .
i' m going to take a picture of your aura , your magnetic field .
say cheese !
i was only kidding .
that' s weird , you hardly have an aura at all .
your chakras appear to be out of harmony .
your sahasra seems to be blocked .
your crown chakra ...
and you blinked .
are you sad about something ?
i' m not exactly happy ...
you should consider therapy .
i don' t know about that ...
think about it .
i could be your coach .
i could be your personal guidance counselor .
the poundhunters 71 kilos .
wow , you' ve lost 8 kilos !
that' s fantastic !
could you tell us your secret ?
my mother' s been visiting for two weeks now , and she thinks i' m fat
so she nags me a lot , and i clean house to blow off steam .
i guess cleaning is good exercise .
camilla .
77 kilos .
you' ve gained two kilos .
invite your mother to stay !
how was it ?
embarassing .
everyone seems to lose weight but me .
it' s expensive too 4, 000 kronor !
for that you get weighed in public every two weeks
and you get a skimpy booklet of diet tips .
for 2, 000 you can weigh yourself alone at my place .
i' m going to quit " the poundhunters " and start dieting for real .
70 kilos ?
it must be a slow news day .
some ley lines ...
a pinch of sha qi ... ... and some negative energy ...
some feng shui ...
a splash of therapy ...
and the singing of the whales ...
hello , i brought you something to cheer you up .
here , it' s the very latest thing .
you punch in the numbers here .
1 . 9 meters .
sex : male , right ?
just step right up .
on that thing ?
your weight is 102 kilos , your body mass index is 28 .
recommended dietary intake 6 7 megajoules if sendentary .
10 megajoules if active .
have a nice day .
great , isn' t it ?
and if it doesn' t behave itself , just remove the batteries .
found yourself a job yet ?
no , i' m too old ...
too old ?
don' t give up !
like i' ve always said , life is full of possibilities .
you' re a man in the prime of life .
you' re just a trifle too pregnant , that' s all .
is this what you had in mind ?
i had pictured something a bit more humoristic .
oh ...
what should we try then ?
how about this ?
not bad ...
do you have chicken suits ?
yes , this way .
would you prefer the kind with an eggshell hat ?
they' re very popular .
no , thank you .
cowls or just beaks ?
cowls , please .
how about accessories ?
like an egg basket that squeaks ?
or an inflatable cock' s comb ?
hi there , ole .
hi there , stig helmer .
i hope these will do .
they' re great .
perfect ...
okay , you guys , put the costumes on .
phat !
your jacket' s phat .
is it vintage ?
you know old .
i bought it in 1970 .
it' s so happening .
take a look .
we did a spread for wallpaper yesterday .
you' ve always been a happening guy .
thou free ranging chicken , thou star of the north
cut !
you' re standing too close together .
" svea broiler " , take 11 .
playback .
the mike is showing .
take 37 .
one hen per 10 square meters .
we' re finished .
damned european union ...
pretty soon every chicken will be entitled to its own bathroom .
the danes have dumped the price of broilers .
no ...
this won' t do ...
we' re history .
andwe just bought two tons of chicken feed , too .
maybe we should accept that ridiculous danish bid .
or go into receivership .
go bust ?
i' d rather go to hell .
i' ve got to cancel our commercial with that norwegian guy .
what insurance do we have ?
full coverage .
why do you ask ?
in case something should happen .
it' s nice to get away from the rat race , isn' t it ?
hi , roger .
go ahead and torture me .
you' re late .
are you very busy ?
yeah , with a tricky commercial .
let' s get started on our regular program .
good work , ole .
slow down on your way back and bend your elbows .
like this ?
perfect .
sorry about that , it' s my cell phone .
bramserud advertising .
what ?
you don' t ...
all right .
okay ...
well , no more tricky commercial ...
damn !
what is it ?
my arm is going numb .
that' s not good .
my friend' s a cardiologist .
what' s that ?
a heart specialist .
i' m ole bramserud .
i' m nurse kristian .
you' il find doctor westerberg over there .
ole bramserud .
karin westerberg .
you' re not swedish , are you ?
your situation isn' t serious .
but you are burning yourself out .
that' s trendy .
you' re no longer in your 20s .
slow down a bit , both with regard to work and work outs .
take walks instead , take a week off and pamper yourself .
i won' t need a walker ?
i' ve fried you a chicken .
don' t mention the creatures !
the broiler factory' s giving us trouble .
i' m sorry to hear that .
what' s that ?
i' m dieting .
what is it this time , the pineapple diet ?
the stewardess method ?
your phone calls last longer than your diets !
that stuff smells like our chicken feed .
how much do they charge for it ?
590 kronor .
do you know how much it costs to manufacture it ?
2 or 3 kronor , tops !
590 kronor ...
for accurate readings , both feet must be placed on scales .
body mass index 14 .
you have lost 49 kilos .
congratulations .
you weigh 142 kilos .
your body mass index , body mass index ...
hands up !
what are you doing ?
why are you waving a golf club ?
i thought you were a burglar .
someone broke into the lundin' s place last week .
aren' t you supposed to eat regularly ?
and shouldn' t you avoid drinking concentrated sauces ?
that stuff' s supposed to be diluted .
bruno , what should i do ?
i can' t handle this any more .
go somewhere , try a week at a spa .
either that , or we' il just have to buy a fridge with a time lock .
good night .
lift your feet up .
therapy ?
well , i never !
throwing out good money on therapy when you' re unemployed .
no one in our family has ever done anything like that .
a rest home !
it' s a spa , ma .
what' s the difference ?
i bet that norwegian friend of yours is behind this .
oh no ...
the vacuum cleaner' s clogged with cheese oodles again .
they' re called " cheese doodles " , ma .
i' il be back at three .
what should i do with these ?
send them back to anderhage .
don' t even mention the word ' chicken ' in the future .
i won' t , boss .
that feels better .
are you going to the new age fair ?
i' il be working at granhedsgrden .
peeling carrots ?
no , they' re making the place over .
they' re offering a specialty week called " the whole person " .
how much do i owe you ?
625 plus tax .
do you accept credit cards ?
of course .
do you like your new place ?
the vibes are good .
how are the neighbors ?
one' s coming along to the spa .
someone sorely in need of therapy .
is she ?
is he ?
he' s a bulimic mommy' s boy .
the silent type .
out of touch with his feelings .
i' m going to coach him .
it' s going to be challenging .
it' s my pleasure to welcome dr levander .
i' m sure you' re familiar with his tv shows and books
like " eating the right way " or " i can fly " .
they' il be on sale at the desk .
please go ahead .
thank you , ulla .
right now , the trend in holistic medicine is specialty weeks .
the idea is to offer package deals to massage the soul .
modern people want more than just a plate full of raw vegetables .
that is why i made this list
of activities that should be available at a modern spa .
the first heading is stress management
with activities such as basic yoga , tai chi , qi gong
circulation massage , rebirthing , rosen therapy
shiatsu therapy and sacred dancing .
the next heading is fitness .
this includes aerobics , step up , spinning
aqua aerobics , mantric jogging , mud packs and aromatherapy .
a new feature is underwater speakers
that play the song of the dolphins .
cosmology and mentalism
heart walks , walking on hot coals and survival courses .
another new feature is that guests may bring their pets along
to meet a dietician or a psychologist .
the canine jacuzzi is very popular .
last , but not least , we come to the menu .
our target group expects something fancier than grated carrots .
we get it .
any questions ?
ping pong yoga ...
quiet , nisse !
that' s qi gong .
their special package deal is called " the whole person " .
but you want to return half as big , right ?
should we give it a try , you think ?
yes , you need to diet .
and i need to take it easy .
5, 000 kronor .
7, 000 kronor .
i don' t mean to offend you , but why don' t you go for the fast ?
aren' t you going to fast ?
nope , doctor' s orders .
i need to consume more fat .
i have some kind of scurvy in reverse .
the next time i see my dietician , i' il slug him with a pork loin .
but now it' s time for dessert .
it may be the last one we ever see .
what are you doing ?
scraping my tongue .
it' s supposed to make your breath sweeter , in case you ever get kissed .
you fall for everything .
i read about it in a magazine .
i bought you this .
what is it ?
a potency patch ?
it enhances potency .
where do they go , over your eyes ?
that wasn' t very nice !
take a look at yourself .
exciting , huh ?
by the way , i did your horoscope .
don' t make any crucial business decisions this month .
what a load of crap !
are we living in the dark ages ?
lots of major companies consult astrologers before making decisions .
suit yourself .
good night .
kissy , kissy !
let' s slow down a bit .
and then pick up the tempo .
and slow down again .
changing pace like this in intervals
improves your stamina and helps burn more fat .
we do have a regular bike , and the area is very scenic .
i thought we weren' t going to discuss this any more .
by the way , claes and i are going to fly over to the broiler factory .
will you be home for dinner ?
i' il let you know .
don' t pull anything , like you did with that rowing machine .
you know i don' t like flying .
you should see somebody , try dr levander .
flying' s safer than driving , and i need to rack up mileage .
i have something to show you .
i have a brilliant idea .
this is my idea .
did you drag me all the way over here to show me chicken feed ?
you' re looking at five million kronor .
what do you mean ?
i' il tell you .
swedes are getting fat from stuffing their faces with potato chips .
that' s when it hit me ...
diet chips .
diet chips ?
people can eat all the chips they want , without the guilt .
what are these chips made out of ?
the two tons of chicken feed left over from our broiler factory .
the factory we' re going to unload .
each bag costs 75 kronor , and that amounts to ... ... a profit of 9 , 925 kronor per bag .
how do we get people to eat it ?
people eat anything .
we threw a party when i was in college .
we served bowls of " doggy delight " and people gobbled it up .
" doggy delight " ?
dog food , the dried variety .
it' s nothing but a scam , that' s illegal .
no , it isn' t .
i had the crap camilla bought analyzed , and it' s the same stuff .
it consists of the by products of fish and some minerals and vitamins .
it' s absolutely brilliant , isn' t it ?
welcome to the health food business !
what will people think about this hocus pocus ?
and dragging city folks into the wild for survival training ? !
i don' t think so , ulla .
it stinks !
just look here .
our new ad
has booked us solid for four weeks .
let people talk !
you take care of the kitchen and i' il take care of the rest .
well , what if dad had lived to see this ?
well , dad ...
i hope they serve linseeds and bran in heaven .
give my best to camilla .
inger ...
do you think you could persuade camilla to go to a fat farm ?
she' s desperate .
i' il give her a call .
the chips ought to contain something japanese , like seaweed .
and a fat blocker , too .
it' s all the rage .
focus your energy on the factory , before it ruins us .
never fear !
don' t shed a tear , my dear for my sake ...
here .
it' s almost time .
what the hell ... ?
i thought this was settled , it will give us publicity .
the two top local papers will both be there !
don' t be such a stick in the mud .
stop it !
this display of initiative by ulla lundgren
has created jobs and put our town on the map ... ... the true spirit of enterprise that our region needs .
the gustav vasa spa is now open to the public .
let' s go for some patterning .
stick your index finger into the first hole in the dial .
take a deep breath
i' m safe in the air " .
i' m safe in the air .
move your finger to the next hole
and repeat the affirmation .
i' m safe in the air .
do this twice a day , preferably in conjunction with meditation .
meditation ?
i' m not into spacey stuff like that .
just find a quiet moment .
how' s business ?
we' re having some ups and downs .
we got stuck with a broiler factory that isn' t going well at all .
but now we' re in the health food business .
what about you ?
i can' t complain .
there are phobics , hypochondriacs and people obsessed with their looks .
there' s no shortage of people in trouble .
bruno and i would like to discuss collaborating with you .
guess what ?
i bought a pair of rubber pants .
are you going to take up diving ?
no , it' s to combat cellulite .
what does bruno think about that ?
we don' t share a bed any more .
he says that i snore .
that you snore ?
men !
i' m glad you' re going to the spa .
it' s going to be interesting .
but in my opinion , bruno and claes should be the ones to go .
overweight men are time bombs .
don' t say that !
bruno says the only exercise he gets
is being a pallbearer at funerals for his fitness freak friends .
he doesn' t want to be in good shape when he dies .
well ?
slim quick " ...
who developed it ?
experts .
has it been tested ?
yes .
it' s been tested extensively on animals .
diet chips ...
it sounds interesting ...
vegans in chlcken sults rald meat transport van
amazing ...
some militant vegans have attacked another meat shipment .
according to witnesses , they were dressed in chicken suits .
you' re lucky nothing like that has happened to you .
chickens !
what about your vitamins ?
i' il take them later .
have a nice time at the gustav vasa spa .
give my best to inger .
i would have taken you there in my plane
but i' ve got a lot of stuff cooking .
that' s right , chicken suits .
just like our commercial .
isn' t that something ?
i' m on my way .
95 % of sweden must be woodlands .
you sure have a lot of gadgets .
a compass , a thermometer ... ... a gage for inclines and one for altitude , and a clock .
air conditioning , a radio , a gps navigation system ...
and according to its reading , we are close to brnnforsen .
yes , i know .
how ?
i read the sign over there .
signs are for cheaters , stig helmer .
the gustav vasa spa ...
let the torture commence .
hello , stig helmer .
hi , i' m rebecka .
i' m ole .
did you have a nice trip ?
i got a bit car sick ...
it' s probably psychosomatic .
we' il cure you .
see you later .
therapy , you say ?
lucky you .
i always overpack .
that' s not excessive .
this is just my small suitcase .
what a beautiful place !
not to mention expensive .
we could have gone to barbados .
he' s a food smuggler .
how can you tell ?
i know the type .
remember the guy who brought roast beef in his dressing case ?
someone even stored pancakes in a container for face cream .
it' s incredible !
i' m ulla , and i' d like to welcome you to the gustav vasa spa .
we' il start by introducing the staff .
anna teaches classes in sacred dance , tai chi and qi gong .
rebecka is our shihatsu therapist .
and rainbow is our vegetarian chef .
linda is our dietician , and composed the drink you have received .
and my brother nils is a jack of all trades .
we have a few house rules .
this is a drug free environment .
toxic substances such as alcohol , nicotine and caffeine are off limits .
we promote life , not death .
fasting gives you bad body odor .
your body is cleansing itself .
for others , the increased intake of roughage may give you gas .
this is because your body is accustomed to eating dead animals .
this discomfort is reduced by daily colonic irrigation .
purchase your own personal nozzle at the desk .
write your name on it so it won' t get lost .
or stolen .
back down onto the nozzle ...
and then you just turn on the hose .
one last thing , please turn off your cell phones .
it' s pretty warm ...
it' s nice .
just so we get acquainted
i' d like us to take each other by the hand and sing a song .
that' s silly , it' s not like this is kindergarden .
it' s just a way of getting to know each other , ke .
rest in peace , dear calorie
soon you will be eaten
hidden deep inside of us
digested and forgotten
it' s like being able to print your own money .
i' m a genius .
we used to only serve grated , raw vegetables .
rainbow has written a cookbook .
" esoteric cuisine " .
so dad' s book isn' t good enough anymore ?
did your dad write cookbooks too ?
the recipes are very orthodox .
gut feeling " ...
stocks in high risk projects in the former east bloc ... ... belong down the drain .
that' s all for tonight , we' il be back in two weeks .
we' il be taking a critical look at diet aids
and how the obese are taken advantage of .
the " diet king " will be featured .
he made millions selling useless pills to overweight swedes .
thanks ...
i should have put more pressure on that stock broker .
he' s pretty slippery .
diet chips ...
that guy has been irritating me for quite some time .
find the manufacturer and analyze the ingredients .
i' m a bit sceptical about these kinds of places .
are you a believer ?
a believer ?
do you believe in crystal therapy and horoscopes ?
no , but it' s fun to see what places like this are all about .
i came here to take it easy .
to rest .
my friend was going to stay here , so i decided to tag along .
what do you do when you' re not keeping friends company ?
i own a small outfit ... an advertising agency .
bramserud advertising .
bramserud , that' s me .
my name is inger .
i' m considering retirement , though ...
leaving the rat race , reading some of the books i' ve bought .
maybe even take bracing walks .
my ex started taking ten kilometer walks when he turned 40 .
and that was the last anyone ever saw of him .
are you married ?
not that i recall .
possibly married to my work , but we' re getting a divorce .
what about you ?
i' m unmarried ... at the moment .
good morning .
that looks yummy .
what is it ?
a decoction of broccoli .
the new italian cuisine , huh ?
what' s this key gong stuff ?
it' s qi gong .
it' s a chinese form of gymnastics , like karate in slow motion .
there was an emperor who outlawed martial arts
and somebody figured that they could do the same motions slowly .
off with your head !
i' m gouging your eyes out .
karate for snails .
if you practise for years , you can use your hands and feet
to make incredibly bad movies .
have you seen rainbow ?
i think he went ... ... that way .
i think he' s in the vegetable garden .
we live in a universal force field .
it can be measured with a squld .
a squid ?
a super conducting quantum interference device .
your aura is a force field and , as such , attracts energy .
at times , we need to recharge our batteries .
hugging a tree will do the trick .
trees willingly share their energy with us .
if you feel embarrased , stand with your back to the tree .
how exciting !
in your mind , greet the tree .
picture yourself inside the tree .
feel its roots .
what the hell ... ?
feel how the tree gets energy from the sun .
no way ...
tree hugging !
well , it' s better than nothing .
it' s actually kind of nice .
give me a hug , stig helmer !
hug me !
let' s have our first therapy session this afternoon .
don' t wear heavy clothing .
i won' t .
oh , ole and i were going to take a hungarian mud bath .
then we' il have our session after that .
don' t forget to take a shower after the mud bath .
there you go .
thanks .
you have dandruff .
i' il prepare a conditioner with lavender and eucalyptus .
i' il also stimulate the acupressure points on the scalp
which counteracts baldness in the future .
slices of biodynamic cucumber
flush out toxins and remove wrinkles .
there we go .
relax completely .
i' m going to leave you for awhile .
make the most out of this session and exercise your pelvic floor .
okay , boss .
i feel like a sandwich .
rebecka' s pretty cute ... ... for a witch .
she looks more like an imp .
tell me about your childhood .
what was your father like ?
like most other dads .
but that isn' t quite true , he was ...
he had a handicap .
in what way ?
he only had one arm .
the olsson brothers dixie jazz band " .
henry played the saxophone and my dad was the drummer .
even though he only had one arm ?
it worked pretty well .
but he couldn' t do drum rolls .
that' s understandable .
he invented a gadget .
you' re repressed .
your body stores these conflicts and makes you tense .
unexpressed grief and anger turn into a muscular coat of armor .
you really need to release some of that aggression .
just lay down , like that .
and lift your arms up like this .
what' s this ?
i want you to try to push me away .
i' il hold on tight and i want you to push me away .
here we go ...
come on .
no ...
come on , give it a go .
there' s some broccoli stuck in your mustache .
come on !
stop it !
say you' re a wimp !
come on , say you' re a wimp !
look , stig helmer' s getting licked by a girl !
you' re the wimp !
what' s that ?
nothing , i guess ...
that felt good .
good .
the energy is good .
there' s a lot of aggression bottled up inside you .
you' re an unusual man , stig helmer .
you' re an only child , aren' t you ?
did you play ball with the kids in the neighborhood ?
yes , but i wasn' t very good .
if you' re going to be a goalpost , you can' t move around .
how does it feel to fast ?
i feel a bit dizzy .
that' s because of the toxins that are being eliminated .
i bet you ate a lot of junk food .
hot dogs , and stuff like that .
last night i had the strangest dream .
i' m ole , the king sized hot dog !
eat me if you dare !
i' m so wonderfully greasy ...
eat me !
you shouldn' t eat anything that has eyes and can bear young .
i never thought of it that way .
you' re a vegetarian then ?
no , a fruitarian .
fruitarian ?
i only eat fruit .
the richest food i eat is bananas .
but i don' t eat bananas either , for other reasons .
you know , because of united fruit and pesticides .
it' s so beautiful here ...
it is .
evenings like this make me long to be back in norrland .
what city are you from up north ?
hrnsand .
those aqua gymnastics wore me out .
are you going to iron ?
what a busy bee !
what' s that ?
wait and see .
presto espresso !
great !
i was dying for some coffee .
right , enough is enough .
that norwegian guy seems very nice .
what , are you dumping the survival course instructor unseen ?
i don' t know ...
bruno' s on the phone all the time .
he and claes are up to something .
did you know that the yanks spend 30 times more a year on dieting
than the un spends on fighting starvation .
how' s our project going ?
brilliantly !
30, 000 packages .
have you given any thought to my radical solution for the factory ?
yes .
in my opinion , you' re short on morals and long on imagination .
what of it ?
it' s against the law !
you have to help , you' re in as deep as me .
wimp !
yes .
could you go pick the guru up ?
he' s arriving on the two o' clock train .
what does he look like ?
oriental , i suppose .
right , six feet tall and blond .
what do i know ?
make a sign and hold it up .
i wonder if it' s ball room dancing ?
hardly .
do you like to dance ?
i was the fred astaire of oslo some 15 to 20 kilos ago .
do you ?
yes , if i get to pick my partner .
i don' t like it when strange men fondle me like it was their right .
but i can always make an exception ...
this is going to be interesting .
ginger rogers must have been a better dancer than astaire .
she did the same moves , only backwards and in high heels .
why did you come along if you' re going to be so negative ?
because we paid a hell of a lot for this week .
and you suggested it .
good morning .
we' il start out with breathing exercises .
place one hand on your stomach , and the other on you back .
take a deep breath
all the way down to your pelvic floor .
envision a string running all the way through your body
and passing out through the top of your head off into the cosmos .
you' re suspended on the string , and you twirl upwards to the heavens .
take a breath ...
relax your arms and let them dangle .
the first phase is the flow .
each movement is followed by a new movement .
it' s like tai chi , an eternal loop .
it goes on and on ...
take a breath .
the next phase is chaos .
let your feelings out .
father no speak swedish .
is he a yoga teacher ?
we have come to pick berries .
gustav vasa ?
this guy thinks i' m the old king gustav vasa .
excuse me ...
viswanathan raj ?
gustav vasa ?
right , gustav vasa .
don' t close your eyes to the invisible .
he who looks outside is dreaming .
he who looks inside awakens .
oh , my ...
i' ve never seen anything like it .
like what ?
something' s happened to you , stig helmer .
your crown chakra is demonstrating great cosmic energy .
a red aura signifies the seventh sense of change and psychic power .
you' re heading in a new direction .
and you blinked ...
would you like mine ?
no , thank you .
what goal did you have this week ?
i hoped to get rid of this ...
i weighed myself this morning .
i' ve gained 20 grams .
really ?
i must be the only person on earth who gains weight on a fast .
are you going to do the survival course ?
i wonder what it involves .
yeah !
i feel like a new human being , not a chicken in days .
did you eat too much chicken ?
it' s a long story .
i' m really dreading this .
it' s only for a few days .
it' s interesting .
i' ve done it a few times .
you face the real you .
i hope she' s skinny .
praeparatus supervivat " , or " the prepared will survive " .
we' il spend a couple of days in the wilderness .
and your only tool will be a knife .
please empty your pockets and place your belongings in the bag .
camilla !
here' s a knife .
thank you .
your knife .
anything else ?
what is that ?
a gps navigator .
for satellite positioning .
take a knife .
may i take two ?
no .
we' re going to have an easy run on the river in a kajak .
i suggest that you pair off .
keep your kajak on course and paddle where the water is most swift .
that' s where it' s the deepest .
okay , men .
you get to head the expedition .
let' s launch the next bunch .
move it , jan .
good luck !
it looks pretty unsteady .
try to paddle in time .
grab the oars , ke .
take it easy .
this is a message from svensk hydro .
the power plant at storforsen will open its floodgates at 1 pm .
this presents a danger to anyone on the river .
oh , my god !
here you go .
hello ...
what ? !
what are the names of the guys paddling off in the distance ?
stig helmer and ole , come back here !
what' s going on ?
the floodgates are open .
wait here , i' il go to the rapids .
there seems to be a lot of water .
don' t break the rhythm !
hold on , stig helmer !
no , there' s not a trace of them .
they' ve probably gotten further downstream .
an easy run " , sure !
i' m never going to do this again .
have the rest of the gang backed out ?
that leaves the two of us , then .
talk about a survival course !
what' s the challenging run like ?
you don' t get a paddle .
a big steak with french fries wouldn' t hurt right now .
but not for you , you' re fasting .
i' m sorry ...
they' il find us soon .
they have heat detecting cameras .
look !
lingonberries .
no , these are bearberries .
arctostaphylos .
this is edible , it' s a fern .
polypodium .
where did you learn all this ?
i was a boy scout .
the beaver patrol " .
are you all right ?
i' m fine .
all that' s missing is the cucumber ...
we need to dry our clothes .
did you happen to learn about making fire ?
the glass lenses of our wristwatches , sandwiched with some water
will make a magnifying glass .
then all we need is to gather some shelf fungi .
fomes fomentarius .
do you know the latin names of all kinds of plants ?
just the ones we needed to learn to earn the " woodcraft badge " .
the police just called .
they couldn' t see them from the helicopter .
if you say " i told you so " , i' il throttle you !
the kajak was found at brnnforsen .
that' s 60 kilometers from here !
here ...
what' s today' s special ?
shoots of pine .
some sourgrass , chanterelle mushrooms and pine gum .
and all this is edible ?
the gum is like chewing gum .
it will help ward off hunger pains
while the shoots and sourgrass contain a lot of vitamin c.
you didn' t happen to find a bottle of chablis premier cru 1982 , too ?
what a day !
too bad it wasn' t sunny , we' il have to try the lenses some other time .
i can tell that you enjoy the outdoors .
i liked going on hikes .
i liked going on trips with the boy scouts .
i used to play in the forest when i was a kid .
i haven' t seen you this happy for a long time .
but i don' t think it' s all thanks to the forest .
i bet rebecka has something to do with it , too .
she' s a fun person , but she is a bit odd .
you suit each other .
you' re a fun person , too , but you are a bit odd .
what a strange week this has been .
but they' re out there somewhere ...
i think .
isn' t that typical ?
as soon as you meet a nice man , he disappears .
body lotion ?
not exactly , it' s whiskey .
for emergencies .
did you bring everything ?
the cans of spraypaint and stuff ?
do we have to do this ?
yes .
put on your gloves .
remember , you haven' t seen a thing .
look , they' il see us with the surveillance cameras .
that' s the point .
that' s why we' re wearing the suits .
put your nose on .
it' s a beak .
look !
it' s big bird !
well , they' re not exactly minks .
we have to get them out before we blow the joint up .
but weren' t we going to blow the car up ?
there' s not much insurance on that old wreck .
come on !
go spray some message on the truck , that' s what they do .
what are you doing ?
i was gong to write " swine " .
it' s a broiler transport !
write something like " murderers " .
smurderers ...
what should we do with these ?
stuff them in that bag for now .
hold on , because it' s going to blow !
what a blast !
i' ve been in the wrong business .
talk about raising the roof !
what are you fooling around with ?
what are you fooling around with ?
nothing .
stig helmer , wake up !
listen ...
maybe they' re looking for us .
wave !
this is a good spot to dump the stuff .
this is a good spot to dump the stuff !
did you see that ?
it might be food .
that yellow stuff looks familiar .
hunger is making me hallucinate .
wake me up ...
aren' t these the suits i bought ... ?
somebody up there' s pulling our leg .
well , at least these are warm and dry .
aren' t you cold ?
could it make any difference what you wear in a nightmare ?
militant vegans blew up a broiler factory in stersen .
the police have no leads as yet .
that would be bruno' s factory !
two people appear to have died in the rapids .
their kajak was found below the falls .
over to the sports desk .
i know they' re alive .
i can feel it !
blasted mosquitos !
maybe we should put on the hoods ?
why not ?
this must be a dandy of a diet .
it would make business sense .
what ?
bramserud & olsson botanical expeditions inc .
should we try that way ?
no , let' s go straight ahead .
finally , traces of civilization .
the trouble is , which way should we go ?
let' s go south .
how would you know that ?
i checked out the anthill .
anthills are always bigger to the south .
you are absolutely incredible , " beaver " .
what a strange country .
there are no berries , just weird people .
let' s go home !
do you have any other bright ideas ?
like going north ?
look !
it' s those militant vegans .
fire a warning shot and i' il call the police .
are they shooting at us ?
i sure hope that' s not a bird dog .
you' ve probably seen this man , dr b. levander
in situations where he can profit from our phobias and hypochondria .
recently , he' s made a foray into the diet industry
with the product " slim quick " .
let' s consult our panel .
rune , you' re a veterinarian .
what' s do you think of the product ?
it' s an excellent product ...
for chickens that need to gain weight .
in addition to fish by products , our analysis revealed the presence
of the antibiotic coccidiostatika
which prevents parasites in chickens .
thank you , rune .
slim quick " is manufactured by bruno anderhage
the owner of svea broiler .
we heartily recommend the product " slim quick "
to people who are chicken hearted and birdbrained .
down the drain it goes !
next time ...
i knew it ...
hush !
i don' t want to hear a peep out of you .
anderhage , here .
it' s about your insurance .
terrorist attacks aren' t covered .
they' re a " force majeure " .
so we' re not covered .
in accordance with item 71 .
tell your ceo that we' re going to appeal .
i am the ceo .
you are the ceo ...
idiots !
i' il be going now ... to the police station .
to turn the two of us in .
it' s just as well ...
and i hope i never have to see you again ... ... bruno asshole !
what a wimp !
this is the police speaking .
lay face down on the ground with your arms over your heads .
don' t worry , stig helmer .
they probably just want to see some id .
come in .
they' ve been found !
i knew it !
how are they ?
fine , i think .
they' il be here soon .
here they come !
oh , here they come !
what on earth are they wearing ?
stockholmers !
they think they' re so superior .
i' m so glad you' re alive .
but why are you dressed like that ?
i don' t know .
you' il have to ask ole , but i don' t think he knows either .
we' ve been so worried .
why are you in chicken suits ?
there' s no sensible explanation .
hello , darling .
guess what ?
i' m going to quit dieting forever .
you have to learn to love the person you are , visnawathan said .
he' s a guru .
how have you been doing ?
just dandy ...
minus 22 kilos , and plus 73 hours of therapy later
i take great pleasure in presenting
one of the most accomplished disciples of visnawathan raj .
recently returned from a yoga center in nepal krishnamacharays !
give him a big hand !
he was known previously as stig helmer olsson .
he who looks outwards is dreaming .
he who looks inwards awakens .
lift your feet , krishnamacharays .
