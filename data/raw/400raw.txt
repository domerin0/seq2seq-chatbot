the time has come , alexander .
f or russia !
f or russia !
f or russia !
f orward , peasant folk , now it' s our turn to hit the germans !
this is a sword of such well tempered steel .
tempering is not the main thing .
the strength of a sword is measured by the arm that wields it !
with knowledge you can even kill a warlock !
where is vasily buslai ?
buslai !
h ere is vasily !
h ere i am !
to your health , vasya !
now we can' t get at them with swords ...
don' t be hasty , saveliy !

smite the germans !
bring the master to me !
take him to the supply train .
we have carried the day !
l surrender .
a q uail may be small , but it' s still a bird .
too bad , the mail is too short .
some lie , torn with swords .
others lie pierced with arrows .
their red blood pouring out . onto the soil of russia ...
l z aslavna !
anastasia !
sister !
he who fell for russia has died a hero' s death .

and a loving spouse .

dear ones !
thank god , you are alive !
where are the germans ?
there are no more germans !
no germans , my dear ones !

spread to the four winds or sunk below the ice !
lf so , we have won the day .
glory to the prince .

olga danilovna .

l shall not live .
olga ... is yours .
what' s with you ?
are you going to die before the wedding ?
what' s with you ?
no , i have not been destined to live .
l shall not take a wife .
you shall live , and your glory will live with you .
bow down before gavrilo .
h e was the first in battle , your hand in marriage belongs to him .
come to your feet , olexich .
city of pskov
with all this commotion nobody thinks about matters of state .
good citi z ens of pskov and novgorod ! l would strike you ,
lash you mercilessly , had you talked away the lce battle !
russia would never forgive us for the lack of daring .
so shall you remember it and shall pass it on to your kin .
and should you forget it , you become like j udas traitors in the eyes of all russia !
l promise : should trouble come , l shall call russia to arms anew and if you stand idly by , l shall strike you mercilessly as long as i am alive , and after it will be the duty of my sons !
and now let us have a court of j ustice .
we should free the foot soldiers .
what say you ?
what shall we do with them ?
they were forced to fight .
and what about the noble knights ?
we shall ask for ransom !
exchange them for soap !
what should we do with him ?
you , the people , should decide his fate !
no enemy shall tread on russian soil .
arise , my people , arise !
give my j udgement , prince .
decide the fate of the girl !
l said i shall not choose the better looking one but the one who was more prominent in battle .
my son vasily has never been second best to anyone !
they won' t let a man live or die in peace .
f orgive me , mother , for contradicting your words .
l have never gone against your will .
don' t slander gavrilo .
j udging fairly , neither of us deserves to be the groom .
vasilisa was blessed with the greatest courage of all !
there were none braver than she !
gavrilo was the next best man .
to this i pledge my honor before the people .
so be it .
you have disgraced your mother !
l wanted to get you married .
so where' s the problem ?
there will be a wedding yet !
couldn' t you even be the first in battle ?
l wasn' t the last .
take for your daughter in law the girl in the chain mail .
what a beauty !
l haven' t lost yet , mother .
and now ...
let us celebrate !
h ooray !
let' s agree in advance , at home keep your fists to yourself .
go and tell everyone in the foreign lands that russia lives .
h e who comes to us as a guest , let him come with no reservation .
but he who comes to us with a sword , shall die by the sword .
on this stands russia , and on this she shall stand forever .
h e who comes to us with a sword
shall die by the sword .
on this stands russia
and on this she shall stand forever .
