23 . 976
wake up , my beauties .
rise and shine .
it' s a brand new day , and the mortal world is at peace .
but not for long .
just look at them .
i pull one tiny thread , and their whole world unravels into chaos .
glorious chaos .
and what could be more perfect than this ?
a noble prince , a priceless treasure , and a black hearted thief .
oh , this is going to be fun .
cetus ?
you know what to do .
let the games begin .
gentlemen , this is what we' ve been waiting for .
the world' s most valuable object is on its way to syracuse .
it' s a shame it' il never get there .
after today , we retire to fiji .
fiji !
fiji !
kale !
aye , captain .
spike !
let' s get rich !
did you catch that last move ?
pretty cool , huh ?
i thought you overworked it .
just a bit .
aw , y ...
overworked it ?
oh , and i was overworking it ?
proteus .
whoa .
this just got interesting .
how long has it been ?
about a lifetime ago .
you still fight like an old lady .
sinbad ?
oh .
ooh .
sinbad .
what ... ?
what are you doing here ?
i' m working .
you ?
what happened to you ?
where have you been ?
hey , love to stop and catch up , but i' ve got things to do , places to go , stuff to steal .
oh ... yeah .
sinbad , we need to talk .
heard about it , read about it , never actually seen it .
the book of peace .
it' s my job to bring it safely to syracuse .
really ?
now , see , now , l i just feel bad , because you' re going to get fired .
you can' t be serious .
you disappear for ten years , show up , and rob me ?
i wish it wasn' t you .
i do .
really .
but ...
but it is me , sinbad .
proteus , we had a special handshake , some code words , a secret hideout .
it was fun , big fun , but , uh , we were kids .
we were friends !
you' re not going to steal this .
not from me .
and what would you do with it anyway ?
the book of peace protects all of us in the twelve cities .
exactly .
so , just imagine how much all of us will pay to get it back .
let me say it again .
a long time ago , you and i were friends .
if that ever meant anything to you , prove it now .
you' re right .
that was a long time ago .
come on .
don' t get all heroic , proteus .
if you want the book , you have to go through me .
what the ... ?
dear gods .
go , spike .
i gotcha !
i gotcha !
well , i see you' re busy .
so , uh , stay in touch .
wait !
wait !
you' re just going to run away ?
uh , yeah .
wh whoa !
sinbad !
you !
my ... !
my ship !
heads up !
now ... stand by for sushi .
give that guy a raise .
come on !
come on , sinbad !
let' s go !
wait .
stand your ground .
w what are you doing ?
hey !
hey , hey !
lobster boy , over here !
run !
fall back !
grab hold !
let' s go !
and the plan ?
how about try not to get killed ?
hold on !
here , you' il need this .
where are you going ?
fishing !
left , right , left , right , left , right , left , right .
now !
whoo !
woo hoo !
oh ...
you okay ?
yeah .
thanks for sticking around .
ah , just like old times .
look out !
sinbad !
the day began with such promise .
and now look .
my sea monster is dead , and i still don' t have the book of peace .
all because of you , sinbad .
uh huh .
and you are ?
eris , the goddess of discord .
no doubt you' ve seen my likeness on the temple walls .
you know , they don' t do you justice .
uh huh .
now ... about my sea monster .
right , right .
listen , i' m sorry about that .
i don' t suppose a heartfelt apology would do .
heartfelt ?
from you ?
sinbad , you don' t have a heart .
that' s what i like about you .
so , i' m going to let you live .
but there' s just one little thing you have to do .
get the book of peace and bring it to me .
right .
hmm .
now , see , that' s a problem for me because i had my own plans for it .
uh , ransom , get rich .
you know , " me " stuff .
you' re not thinking big enough , sinbad .
steal the book for ransom , and you' il be rich enough to lounge on an island beach .
steal the book for me , and you can buy the beach , and the island and the world .
hmm .
you let me live , you make me rich ,
i retire to paradise .
so far , i don' t see a downside .
if you keep your word .
sinbad , when a goddess gives her word , she' s bound for all eternity .
all right , you' re on .
i knew you' d see it my way .
so , when you' ve stolen the book , follow that star beyond the horizon .
you' il find yourself in tartarus , my realm of chaos .
tartarus .
i' il see you there .
it' s a date then .
so , where were we ?
oh , yes .
you were holding your breath .
he' s so cute .
and so gullible .
cetus , well done .
sinbad , you' re alive !
glad you made it .
pay up .
he lived .
what happened down there ?
you wouldn' t ... believe me if i told you .
try me .
all right , here goes .
so i meet eris , the goddess of chaos .
she' s got a major crush on me , and she invited me back to her place .
ha !
that' s a good one !
goddess of chaos ?
oh , i' m writing that down .
so , that' s it then ?
no book .
now what do we do ?
a little patience , rat .
it' s not like we don' t know where it' s going .
men , all sails to syracuse !
right away , sir !
for as long as i can remember ,
i' ve dreamed of this moment .
the sacred treasure that' s protected us for a thousand years is now in syracuse .
a toast !
to dymas !
hear , hear !
to the book of peace !
and to you , king dymas and prince proteus .
make way !
you see ?
this is what happens when you use the front entrance .
mm hmm .
what is he doing here ?
at least he' s not out robbing someone .
that' s because everyone worth robbing is here .
i' il bet you ten crowns you' re about to put those swords down .
i' il take that bet .
guards ... put away your swords .
i don' t see you for ten years , and now twice in one day ...
you' re smothering me .
i knew you' d want to thank me for saving your life ... again .
you probably just heard we had free food and wine .
you hear that , guys ?
dinner and drinks are on the prince .
come on .
there' s someone i want you to meet .
get to work .
weapons ?
here she is .
i' ve told her all about you .
sinbad , i would like to introduce you to my fiancee , the lady marina , ambassador from thrace .
so , this is the infamous sinbad .
i heard all about this morning .
first you tried to rob proteus , and then you save his life .
so , which are you ... a thief or a hero ?
sinbad wanted to give me an opportunity to thank ... ... him .
eight months on the sea with nothing but eggs and pickles ... you don' t know what that can do to a man .
oh , it' s almost too easy .
there' s only a handful of guards .
forget it .
let' s get back to the ship .
just like that ?
but the book is almost ours .
oh .
wh what ?
who is she ?
an old girlfriend ?
i' m afraid it' s not that simple .
let' s go .
jed , pack it up .
what ?
l i ...
i just put the ...
oh , this is just too easy .
now that sinbad' s gone , your father can finally relax and enjoy the evening .
well , you' re right about that .
he' s trying not to show it , but he' s so proud to have the book in syracuse .
he' s been planning this day his whole life .
and soon it will be your responsibility .
our responsibility .
it' s beautiful .
it is .
my father spent years preparing it for the book .
there are guards on every level , and if you look up to the ...
ah ...
you were talking about the ocean , weren' t you ?
i only wish i' d seen more of it .
i used to imagine sailing far beyond the twelve cities , discovering the world .
oh , look at it , proteus .
there' s so much wonder .
marina ...
our marriage was arranged many years ago .
it' s always been expected of us .
but politics is not a reason to get married .
uh , and i don' t want you to do this just because it' s your duty .
i' m asking you for myself now .
marina ... will you marry me ?
proteus , i ...
there you are !
i think the delegates from manoli are trying to give a toast .
although , i' m not sure .
they' re doing something with their knees .
marina , i need an ambassador .
of course , sire .
huh ?
who' s there ?
huh ?
sinbad !
i love playing pretend .
all the pieces are coming together .
proteus , the book !
sinbad .
proteus !
it' s about time .
do you realize how serious this is ?
do you realize how many times i' ve heard that today ?
you' ve betrayed syracuse !
oh ... not you , too .
stealing the book of peace , when you knew how much it meant to us !
proteus , here' s the way this works .
first , i actually commit a crime , and then you get to blame me for it !
then how do you explain this ?
eris .
what ?
eris ... she framed me .
sinbad , listen to yourself .
trust me , proteus , the book is in tartarus .
talk to your father .
tell him i' m ...
this is beyond my father .
the ambassadors are convening now for your trial .
whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa .
trial ?
i didn' t do it !
look , i left the book on your ship , and that' s the last i saw of it .
you were there .
you know the truth .
you know me .
do i ?
i knew a kid .
who are you now , sinbad ?
look me in the eye and tell me .
did you steal the book ?
no .
we' ve heard enough of your lies .
sinbad , for the last time , give us the book .
how many times do i have to say it ?
i don' t have it !
very well , then .
the delegation of the twelve cities finds you guilty of treason , and we sentence you to die .
take him away .
come on !
this is a joke , right ?
are you ... are you people blind ?
i didn' t do it !
stop !
i demand the right of substitution .
take me in his place .
no !
sinbad says that eris took the book ... and i believe him .
let him go to tartarus and recover the book .
what ?
what are you doing ?
you claim that eris stole the book ... steal it back .
you' re good at that .
hey , look , i will not be responsible for your life .
you would do the same for me .
no , i wouldn' t .
if sinbad is allowed to leave the city , he' il never come back !
son , listen to reason .
no , father , you listen .
sinbad either stole the book , or he' s telling the truth and it' s in tartarus .
either way , he' s our only hope .
but you can' t ...
proteus , you realize that if sinbad does not return , you will be put to death in his place .
i understand .
so be it .
sinbad has ten days to return the book .
release him .
oh , and , sinbad ... don' t be late .
hmm .
so , any idea how we actually get to tartarus ?
tartarus ?
oh , no , no , no , no .
people get killed in tartarus .
so where are we going ?
fiji .
fiji ?
this time of year ?
think of the beaches .
oh , beautiful , if you like mosquitoes .
think of the sun .
it' s monsoon season .
oh , then the women .
they' re cannibals , sinbad .
exactly .
come on , kale .
he' s your friend .
listen to you .
you sound like my mother .
proteus will be fine .
you' re sure of that ?
you and i both know
dymas is not going to let them execute his only son .
so we' re running away ?
we' re retiring .
we don' t need another score .
we' ve got enough .
now , set a course for fiji .
gentlemen , we' re heading to fiji !
fiji !
fiji !
kale ...
book .
proteus .
look at all this .
i can' t believe it .
oh , but this can' t be real .
it' d be far too deli ...
uh oh .
this is more like it .
stolen from venezia .
from pompeii ...
and from a brothel in syracuse .
good guess .
what do you think you' re doing here ?
i' m here to make sure you get the book of peace .
or bring back your dead body if you fail .
really ?
and how are you going to pull that off ?
by whatever means necessary .
did you bring a crew ?
no .
you know how to get to tartarus ?
um ... no .
can you navigate on your own ?
yes !
well , good !
then i' il dump your butt in a rowboat , and you can paddle all the way back to syracuse .
' cause we' re going to fiji .
fiji ?
yup .
just as i thought .
what ?
sinbad , you' re not a very complicated guy .
all someone has to do is imagine the most gutless course of action , and you' re bound to take it .
hey , this is not my problem .
i did not steal the book .
you' re really not going to lose any sleep over this , are you ?
not a wink .
because me , i' d be tossing and turning , knowing i' m alive ... because i let my friend die .
i' m not responsible for this mess .
and i didn' t ask proteus to put his neck on the line for me .
look , clearly i can' t appeal to your honor .
but i have other ways of convincing you .
really ?
uh ... just how do you expect to do that ?
by speaking your language .
keep talking .
yup , this' il do !
but not for first class .
as you can see , we' re well equipped to accommodate the most discerning of royal tastes .
we have excellent ocean views ... ... luxurious living quarters , with three gourmet meals a day ... pickles , eggs , and pickles .
oh , hey , spike , there you are .
i' d like to introduce you to your new bunkmate ... well , actually , you' re his new bunkmate , as it' s actually his bunk .
we do hope you have a pleasant stay aboard the chimera .
oh , if he starts hugging your leg , it means he likes you .
if you think ...
how did she even get on the ship ?
gentlemen , we have a new course .
we' re going to tartarus .
huh ?
what happened to fiji ?
what ?
no fun ?
no beaches ?
rat .
sorry , captain .
but did you say tartarus ?
that' s right .
will that be the same tartarus from which no sailor ever returns ?
the tartarus of lost souls , where they grind your bones and pickle your spleen , and ...
no , rat .
this is the nice tartarus , with lots of beaches and drinks .
you know , with little umbrellas ?
non ci posso credere , non ci posso credere , mi hanno fregato ancora .
i' m only doing this for the money .
right .
so how do we get there ?
that star' s our point .
wow .
our little thief isn' t going to run away .
he thinks he' s going to pay us a visit .
hmm .
let' s provide some mood music .
oh , come on .
you look great .
look lively !
jed , get the long poles !
oh , pardon me , milady .
hey , we need a pole over here .
jin , one over here .
yeah , come on , come on , come on .
the dragon' s teeth ?
indeed , signorina .
only the most foolish of captains would dare to sail a ship through this !
rat , reef the fores' le .
oh , ex excuse me , signorina .
are you sure you know what ... ?
yes , we' ve done this kind of thing before .
no , there is no other way .
look ...
and , yes , but ... you have my permission to stand there quietly and get a free lesson in sailing .
you know ...
besides , a ship is no place for a woman .
jin !
easy on the main !
aye !
steady as she goes .
rocks off the starboard bow !
steady .
what is that sound ?
shh .
sinbad , i ...
sirens .
sinbad .
sinbad !
jin ?
li ?
come and get it , ladies !
kale ?
come with me .
we' il speak of love .
oh ...
who' s bad ?
sin bad .
ah ... men .
i saw her first !
round the deck !
now !
yeah ...
amore !
amore !
amore !
my darling .
rat !
i love you .
il mare e le onde andiamo via .
spike !
get sinbad !
ow !
spike , the blades !
oh , my precious .
wake up , you idiot !
what happened ?
sinbad saved us .
no , marina .
marina saved us ?
marina !
marina saved us .
all right , men , snap out of it .
let' s get back to reality .
we got a ship to sail .
here' s my little hero .
you were so brave .
yeah .
what a good dog .
uh ...
uh ...
still think a ship' s no place for a woman ?
absolutely !
i mean , look at my ship !
this railing was hand carved mahogany !
and here !
these moldings came all the way from damascus !
do you have any idea what i went through to steal these ?
that' s exactly why women shouldn' t drive .
are you crazy ?
i saved your life !
oh , i would' ve been fine .
i always am .
right .
so ungrateful .
it' s just typical .
and you chipped the paint !
right here ...
look at it .
that' s more than a little scratch .
the dog and the crew and th th that woman !
what ? !
thank you !
you' re welcome !
no problem !
don' t worry about it !
i won' t !
good !
good bye !
bye to you !
you happy now ?
proteus , come quickly .
what ?
wh ... ?
there' s a ship waiting in the harbor .
a crew of my most trusted officers will take you far from syracuse .
but the ambassadors ' guards ?
are asleep or well bribed .
but we must go now .
go where ?
to live the rest of my life in exile ?
to live , son .
i won' t let them execute you for sinbad' s crime .
neither will sinbad .
proteus , don' t be foolish !
sinbad has no intention of going to tartarus .
the sinbad you knew as a child is ...
is still in him as a man .
i' ve seen it .
proteus ...
go , father .
i know what i' m doing .
all right , listen up .
we' re here for ten minutes .
you get lost , you get left .
how did one woman do so much damage ?
all right , i' m going to need the full set of chisels , the jack plane , and about a cord of cut wood .
all right , men , you heard the captain .
find some logs and be quick about it .
oh , for heaven' s sake !
you only need a little tree sap , and she' il be as good as new .
when i want your advice , i' il ...
hey , hey , hey !
where do you think you' re going ?
well , fine !
at least take someone with y ...
may i assist you , lady ?
why , thank you .
right this way , signorina .
how nice to see some men haven' t forgotten a little common courtesy . ... common courtesy .
not so fast .
but you know she' s right .
the tree sap would be perfect for ...
just ... stay with the ship .
i already said thank you .
that' s what this is all about , isn' t it ?
it' s about repairing the ship .
if i break something , i fix it .
um , knife , please .
oh , yeah , like i' d give you a weapon ?
thank you , rat .
you know , you really ought to be a little more courteous .
oh , great .
now i' m getting etiquette lessons from a bilge rat .
well , she did save the ship , captain .
why , thank you , luca .
and now she' s helping to fix it .
very handy , i say .
and brave !
this ... girl wouldn' t know how to fix a broken fingernail !
honestly , you are the most boorish , pig headed man i' ve ever met .
hey , lady , i' ve seen the highborn boys your type hangs out with ... ... and i' m the only man you' ve ever met .
whoa .
mmm .
oh , no .
no .
no .
no ...
five on marina .
you ... you ... egotistical ...
you spoiled ...
disrespectful ,
deluded , pretentious , pompous ,
high and mighty ...
self centered , untrustworthy , ungrateful , impossible , insufferable ...
at least i' m not repressed !
repressed ? !
i' il show you repressed !
what the ... ?
put it back .
whoa !
whoa !
whoa , whoa ...
ew ...
ew !
run !
it' s a fish !
it' s a fish !
kale !
kale !
whoa !
jump !
kale !
got it !
veer off , kale !
the star !
hold your heading !
rat , tie it off !
wha ... wha ...
ha ha !
wait !
yee ha !
sinbad !
the men can' t take much more .
i can' t ... take much more , either .
cut the line !
oh , no , spike !
whoa , hold on , no ...
no , no , no , please ...
oh , spike !
hey , where' d he get the carrots ?
whose idea was that again ?
i don' t know .
but he owes me lunch .
the granite gates .
bet you never thought i' d get us this far .
no , i didn' t .
but proteus did .
for some reason , he trusts you .
well , what could he have been thinking ?
how did you two ever meet ?
running for my life , as usual .
a couple of angry thugs had cornered me outside the palace walls .
i was trapped .
a sword at my throat , at my chest , at my ...
pickles and eggs !
well , you get the idea .
and then suddenly , there was a fourth blade .
it was proteus .
you see , he' d watched it all from his room in the palace .
he actually climbed down the castle wall to fight at my side , and , boy , did we fight .
it was like we' d rehearsed it .
we were best friends from that day forward .
what happened with you two ?
what is it ?
we ... took different paths .
enough talking .
time for some screaming .
for crying out loud , what next ?
oh , get a shirt on before you poke someone' s eye out .
okay , guys , get down there and break it up !
we' ve got to keep moving !
steal the book of peace .
we will retire in the tropics .
everyone , back on the ship !
hurry !
come on !
come on !
move faster !
jed !
grab the rope !
rat , your hand !
marina !
rat !
don' t let the blocks freeze !
aye , aye , captain .
and , kale !
aye !
give me a hug ?
excuse me ?
hmph .
oh , she couldn' t see the bird ?
everyone else saw it .
it' s as big as a freakin ' ship .
marina ?
marina' s looking the other way .
shh , shh , shh .
you' re rescuing me !
yes , if that' s what you want to call it .
but this is going to cost you another diamond .
rescues aren' t part of the usual tourist package .
so ... how are we going to get down ?
i ...
i don' t know .
what ? !
i don' t know yet .
i' m thinking about it , all right ?
you scaled a thousand foot tower of ice , and you don' t know how to get down ?
of all the ungrateful ...
look , if you' d rather take your chances on your own , that can be arranged .
shh shh shh shh .
all right .
all right .
so , what do we have to work with ?
um ... ropes ?
uh ... no .
uh , grappling hooks ?
yeah ... no .
your swords ?
hey , i' ve got this .
oh , great .
he can pick his teeth when he' s done with us .
yeah .
okay .
see , in the hands of an expert , a good knife has 1, 001 uses .
ooh !
uh ...
run !
come on !
faster !
w wait , wait .
what ?
let' s go !
no ... !
oh !
oh !
oh !
ah !
i think we lost him !
i don' t think so !
heads down !
wh wh wh wh whoa !
whoa !
oh , no !
lean right !
whew .
come on !
hang on !
yep , there they are .
there ...
just as i ... planned .
it' s marina !
we thought you were gone forever !
oh , i' m fine .
really .
but i' m touched by your concern .
yee ha !
sinbad ?
thank you for coming after me .
well , y ... you' re welcome .
this life suits you .
yeah .
i wasn' t made for dry land .
and you ?
is it the shore ... or the sea ?
i' ve always loved the sea .
i even dreamed of a life on it .
but it wasn' t meant to be .
i have responsibilities in syracuse .
you really have to give it up ?
yes .
you know , i' ve traveled the world , seen things no other man has seen ... but nothing ... nothing compares to the open sea .
and is this what you always wanted ?
not really .
when we were young , proteus and i used to talk about joining the royal navy and serving syracuse side by side .
but as we got older , our lives began to change .
he' s a prince , and i' m ... well .
i was never jealous of him , though ... until one morning , a ship came into harbor ... a ship with his future on it .
it was the most beautiful thing i' d ever seen .
what was on the ship ?
you .
proteus met you at the dock .
i jumped on the first outbound ship and never looked back .
until now .
the gates of tartarus .
rat !
give me a lookout !
we' re dead .
what is it ? !
i i it just ends , captain !
it' s the edge of the world !
pay up .
it' s flat .
well , that' s it .
time to go home .
nuh uh uh .
the captain hasn' t given his orders yet .
follow that star beyond the horizon .
beyond the horizon .
sinbad ?
men !
all hands to your posts !
free all sheets !
wait for my command !
what ?
now !
go !
go !
go !
eh , sinbad , how how are we gonna pull this off ?
just trust me .
rat !
rig the main yard to the fors' le !
but that would stop us dead !
just do it !
aye , aye , captain .
whoa !
slack to all sheets !
aye , aye , cap' n !
cut the fore and main trusses !
move !
move !
move !
i got it .
i got it .
i got it .
aft yard astern !
but that' s ...
crazy , i know !
now hurry !
here , grab it !
go !
swing the fors' le to port !
ease the aft !
full hoist to forward sails !
aye , aye , captain .
come on !
pull !
tie off all sails !
all hands amidships !
and pray to the gods .
we may be meeting them soon .
we' re going to die .
hold on !
grab the rope !
come on , come on , come on , come on !
it worked ?
sinbad ... ... you did it .
grab hold !
grum , hard to port !
hard to port !
kale !
aye !
if i don' t make it , the ship is yours .
no .
gentlemen , it' s been a privilege robbing with you .
i' m coming with you .
and don' t tell me the realm of chaos is no place for a woman .
hmm .
i would never say that .
hey , sorry , boy .
not this time .
huh ?
huh ?
huh ?
now , now , my pets .
is this any way to treat a guest ?
okay , i' m severely creeped out .
bravo .
no mortal has ever made it to tartarus before .
alive , that is ...
make yourself at home .
thank you .
uh ... nice place you got here .
like it ?
i' m planning on doing the whole world this way .
wow , that' s a good plan .
well , i see you' re busy , so listen , we' il just take the book of peace and get of your way .
what makes you think i have it ?
uh , well , you framed me for the theft , so they would execute me .
you ?
yeah .
no .
proteus !
you knew he would take my place .
what a clever little man you are .
you thought i' d run .
then proteus would die , and syracuse would be ...
left without the next rightful king , and tumble into glorious chaos .
you humans are so predictable .
proteus couldn' t help being ever so noble , and you couldn' t help betraying him .
but i didn' t betray proteus !
i didn' t run away .
oh , but you did betray him .
you stole his only love .
look at her , sinbad .
he' s not even in his grave yet , and you' re moving in on his girl .
your heart is as black as mine .
you' re wrong about him !
he knows i' m not !
you don' t know what' s in his heart .
oh , yes , i do .
and more importantly , so does he .
in your heart , you know that
proteus is going to die because he saw something in you that just isn' t there .
no .
you want to bet ?
i' il tell you what .
let' s play a game .
and if you win , i' il give you the book of peace .
there it is , noble hero .
not so fast .
my game has rules , sinbad .
i' il ask you a question .
one simple question .
if you answer truthfully , the book is yours .
give me your word .
you still don' t trust me ?
uh ... no .
isn' t it a pity we live in such skeptical times ?
oh , all right .
you have my word , as a goddess .
fair enough ?
ask your question .
excellent .
now , we all know what happens if you get the book of peace .
you return it to syracuse and save proteus .
but if you don' t get the book , you have a choice to make .
either sail to paradise with the woman of your dreams , or return to syracuse to die .
you' re either a thief or a hero .
so , here' s my question , sinbad .
if you don' t get the book , will you go back to die ?
i will go back .
you' re lying .
i' m sorry , marina .
eris is right about me .
no , she' s not .
you answered her question .
you told the truth .
it wasn' t the truth .
it was me trying to pass myself off as someone i' m not .
sinbad , i' ve seen who you are !
you don' t need to pretend !
eris trapped you !
why should you or proteus or anyone have to die ? !
marina ...
no !
you need to escape .
get as far away as you can .
i' il go back .
i' il explain everything .
no , marina .
i can' t watch you die !
i love you .
but could you love a man who would run away ?
i bet you thought i wouldn' t make it .
i was ... ... beginning to wonder .
the book ?
i did my best .
it wasn' t enough .
no .
you came back anyway .
how could i do anything else ... my friend ?
get back !
how dare you ? !
everything was going perfectly , and now you do this !
eris , i don' t understand .
don' t play coy with me .
maybe you can fool these people , but i know who you are .
you' re a selfish , unprincipled liar !
wait a minute .
i didn' t lie .
i came back .
that' s why you' re here .
this was all part of your test .
i told the truth .
and wasn' t there something about being " bound for all eternity " ?
well , well , well .
this has got to be a little embarrassing for you , eris .
don' t push your luck , sinbad .
you' re cute , but not that cute .
and lucky for you , i' ve got places to go , things to destroy , stuff to steal .
ta .
you know , for what it' s worth ,
i think the council believes you now .
you think ?
king dymas .
uh , whoa , hey .
how much you got on you ?
i offer you the gratitude of the twelve cities , and the apology of a king .
no , really .
how much ?
sinbad .
come on .
this is going to be a heck of a party .
everyone' s going to want to hear about the voyage .
fair winds , calm seas .
nothing much to tell .
what' s the matter ?
no fun if you' re actually invited ?
no , it' s just , uh ... there' s a hammock in fiji with my name on it .
good sailing , sinbad .
get a haircut .
you' re going to be king someday .
just another uneventful day in syracuse .
you know , i stood here with a woman once .
she looked over the ocean and wished she could sail beyond the horizon .
she saw ... such wonder .
and what happened to this woman ?
she got her chance .
she sailed the seas , and she fell in love .
proteus , i ...
marina , follow your heart .
mine is here in syracuse .
yours ... yours is sailing with the next tide .
oh , proteus .
hmm ?
we' re ready to sail .
all right , kale .
take us out .
oh ...
rat !
what ?
excuse me , captain .
you need to replace these rig joints pretty soon .
the mizzen ropes need the support .
these joints were from the jasmine sea .
that' s halfway around the world .
then we' d better get started .
well , you know ,
that means going through the hydra' s lair .
mm hmm .
the minotaur' s haven .
the cyclops ' den .
mm hmm .
under the swansea bridge .
through the china seas .
that' s a very long voyage .
and it' s very , very dangerous .
don' t worry .
i' il protect you .
oh , spike .
spike .
spike ... down .
