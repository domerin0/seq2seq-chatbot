it all comes down this .
these 40 or 50 minutes of playing live a few times a month .
# now i dream on the radio #
# asking , " where' s my guy ?
did he fuck up ? " #
# no one thought we' d see this day #
# when we all thought he dropped away #
# the rich orpoor , right or left #
# black and white died the same death . #
at the end ofthe day , when all is said and done , you got your band , you got your family , and you got your friends . # it' s a beautiful planet # and if you' re really lucky ...
# it' s a wonderful life # ... they' re all one and the same . # ... and after the bar bash #
# i' m having a party all by myself #
# i' d invite the world , but everyone' s dead #
# shall i comb my hair ?
shall i wait on guests ? #
# it gets any later , just wait on death ! #
all my life , all i ever wanted to be
was a rock and roll star .
# it' s a beautiful planet #
instead , i' m a musician ...
it' s a wonderful life ! ... just some chick in a band . # it' s a beautiful planet #
and you know what ?
it' s a wonderful life !
it' s fucking cool !
# my life is three chords so let me finish #
