hey .
hi .
i need to sit down .
oh , god , i' m so fat !
so what papers do you need me to sign ?
don' t tell me i forgot them .
i' m forgetting everything .
it' s because of the hormones .
which , by the way , made me a complete freak the last time i saw you .
i' m sorry again for being so hostile .
how are you doing ?
it' s so good to see you again .
hi , lisa , i didn' t know you were in town .
what' s new ?
doing the whole single mom routine .
right , i can see that .
good for you .
are you taking pictures these days ?
no .
i took some photos with a friend' s camera and i wanted to keep doing it .
so i went on ebay and i got my own .
but it was really just because i was bored and it was kind of stupid .
but ...
i have to go to school .
so i' il see you later .
i' il be out in a second .
shit !
okay , let' s go .
hey , you think your chair seems right for that space ?
you said you were kidding about me not bringing my ugly ass furniture .
it' s so big .
it' s a really good chair for watching television .
i guess .
maybe it is too big .
i think it is .
it' s too big .
you know , i' il put it in storage with the rest of my stuff .
shit .
i gotta return the great escape today .
i' m gonna be fucking late .
i' il return it .
it' s on my way .
i never get tired of watching steve mcqueen .
i think i' ve seen every one of his movies at least three times .
yeah , some of them four times .
wow , this is ...
since i want your name on the birth certificate ... my lawyer says you need to sign away all custodial rights .
i thought ...
what ?
i thought we were gonna be more casual about this .
it' s a baby .
it' s hard to be that casual about it .
right .
maybe i should have my lawyer look at this .
it' s just a formality .
cut the bullshit and just sign it .
okay .
you know what' s weird about dead people ?
everything ?
how they look so perfect .
i just want to mess this woman' s hair up a little bit .
please don' t .
when i die , i want to be one big mess .
messy .
nate , i' m not accusing you .
it' s better this way .
we both know that .
i mean , i can' t lie .
of course , i would' ve loved to do this with someone who wanted to be a father .
i' m sorry .
i don' t know what else to ...
but then i think how perfect this baby is .
and everything somehow seems right .
you know , somehow it' s just so funny .
and you know , actually , i' m proud , in a weird way .
what do you mean ?
i mean , i' m having a child ... with the last person in the world who would ever want a child .
why aren' t you wearing your casts ?
i take them off .
it' s time for me to go .
but you' re supposed to keep them on until next week .
i' m calling the doctor .
he say it' s okay .
look .
see ?
your left foot looks purple .
is always like that .
is from bad circulation .
you know that .
i guess i forgot .
okay , it' s time to get this show on the road , yeah ?
i guess i could call a taxi ...
even though it' s a total rip off .
i can drive you !
it was a heart attack .
he died just like that .
so you want a traditional thai buddhist service ?
if that' s a problem , we can go somewhere else .
there are very specific elements , and if you can' t do it ...
please do not behave this way .
you will have to excuse my son .
he and my husband hadn' t spoken in months , and ...
mom , please .
not in front of this person .
okay , mr. fisher , if you know the procedure , let' s hear it .
actually , i' ve only been here for a year or so , and ...
although i did read zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance in high school ...
that' s probably my brother .
david !
sorry i' m late .
i had to stop at video west .
some idiot ahead of me was writing a check .
i didn' t even want to watch a movie last night , but keith got his way , as usual .
this is ...
bette and phil srisai .
i' m david fisher .
i spoke to you on the phone yesterday .
i' m so sorry for your loss .
thank you .
we were just discussing my father' s service .
i assume the deceased will remain at the temple for three days ... before we have the service here ?
the buddha , the altar , the carpet kneelers .
and you' il want some monks for chanting .
we prefer to use the ones from riverside ... but if those aren' t to your liking , we have some good ones over in eagle rock .
nikolai , your apartment is so ...
it' s very ...
it has a lot of charm .
thank you .
i still don' t know what your big rush was .
you could' ve stayed with me until ...
it was time .
but how do we know you' re safe here ?
you could be hurt by these ruffians .
i spoke to yuri .
i tell him that february is the biggest month for flowers .
he say he give me 30 days to come up with the money .
are you gonna be able to do it ?
yeah , sure , of course .
well , that' s nice .
thank you for all the taking care of me .
you don' t have to do that now .
you are done .
what about dinner ?
you probably don' t have any food .
i was gonna pack you lamb , but i forgot .
i' il go get the lamb .
no , i' il be fine .
i get takeout from eat a pita .
goodbye , nikolai .
goodbye , ruthie .
i bet you mr. van kirk has sex with students in here after hours .
we should stake this place out later , okay ?
claire ?
oh , fuck .
i think there was dust on the negative .
no one' s gonna notice .
no , i want it to be perfect .
claire , these are so sick !
thanks .
i' ve taken shots of almost every single person ... that' s come through in the past three weeks .
they' re amazing .
it' s like each one is someone who' s lying in bed with you ... telling you a little story before you go to sleep .
i' m putting them together for that thing for foster' s class .
the fucking spoon river anthology paper ?
yeah .
i just thought that since each poem is from the perspective of a dead person ... that it would be a really interesting way to ...
i don' t know .
show what the poems brought out in me .
okay , that sounded really geeky .
no , that' s genius .
you could really do something with this .
yeah , right .
claire , i have to tell you something .
i got into yale .
i heard yesterday .
you don' t feel jealous or hate me , right ?
no .
you worked really hard for it .
congratulations .
i know you didn' t play the game the way i did ... but i' m sure you' il get into ucla , which is a really good school , too .
actually , no , i didn' t make the cut .
but they sent me a list of community colleges i could go to ... and said to try again next year .
so i' m looking at east valley .
i' m gonna be a famous photographer and make a gazillion dollars ... taking pictures of anorexic models and fucked up actors .
so maybe i don' t even need to go to college , right ?
it' s a joke .
i' m joking .
but you could .
you should just become a photographer .
because , truthfully , east valley is kind of a shitty school .
so there was that one a month ago in the bookstore .
then i met this other guy at the farmers market .
that place has gotten so touristy .
and then there was this guy last week at the rose caf , who ...
no , that doesn' t count .
that was an almost one .
what exactly do you hope to get out of therapy ?
melissa gave me your number because i guess i' m ...
i don' t know .
it' s not that i' m unhappy .
i' m not unhappy .
i' m really not .
but i know that what i' m doing is a little strange .
i mean , most people who are engaged to someone they really love ... don' t have sex with strangers .
or maybe they do .
does that matter ?
i think i like the euphoria i get from these encounters .
i' m just having a little trouble with anxiety .
what do you mean ?
i don' t know .
it' s like i' m coexisting in these two separate realities .
there' s my nate reality , and then there' s this other reality .
and i would like to not feel so anxious about it .
it' s not guilt .
it' s just edginess .
so , that' s it .
i' d like to not feel edgy .
that' s why i' m here .
okay , so you would like ... to continue to have these encounters , as you call them ...
but you would like to not feel edgy .
ideally .
i know what you' re thinking .
you think that i' m afraid of intimacy ... so i' m trying to sabotage my relationship with my fianc .
is that what i' m thinking or is that what you' re thinking ?
no .
i just wanted to clarify ... that i don' t necessarily think that what i' m doing is destructive .
it might even be healthy .
how so ?
maybe it' s not good for me to totally lose myself in one person ... and this is a way for me to have ... a completely separate , private area that' s my own .
not his , not ours .
maybe that' s healthy for me .
listen , i assume that melissa told you ... one of my specialties is sexual addiction .
no .
i don' t know how much you know of this issue , but obviously ... it involves the sublimation of emotions that are too painful to address .
it' s the root of all addiction , really .
i' m sorry , but i don' t think i can help you because you don' t need help .
you' ve clearly evolved beyond the need for therapy .
i' m actually in awe of you ... because i' d be fucking strangers like a truck stop whore on crack ... if i wasn' t so inhibited by my judeo christian upbringing .
it' s not down here .
we used to have a few buddhas in here .
i can' t believe we can' t find one .
i' ve read all this stuff about buddhism , but it never stays with me .
just know that everything is nothing .
is that it ?
i thought it was , " nothing is everything .
it' s the same thing , isn' t it ?
i found one .
it looks kind of girly , doesn' t it ?
sort of .
think it' s water damage .
i' il get you some stuff to clean him off , okay ?
his little hat is cute , so pointy .
i wonder if anyone poked their eyes out on one by accident .
look at all these unclaimed cremains .
can you imagine having a member of your family cremated ... and then not caring enough to pick up their ashes ?
i think sometimes it' s too hard for people to acknowledge ... that someone they loved is now just chunks of soot .
david fisher .
hey .
yes , i returned the videos .
didn' t i say i would ?
sure , swordfish is fine .
whatever .
bye .
you hate swordfish .
i know .
it' s funny .
now that keith and i are living together ...
i find myself trying to be so fucking agreeable all the time .
why ?
because , if you aren' t , things come up ... and you' ve no idea how big the thing' s gonna be .
it' s like this constant negotiation .
you can never just relax .
is that just a phase or is it always going to be like that ?
don' t ask me .
look , i have no fucking idea .
maybe that' s just what a relationship is .
constantly doing things you have absolutely no desire to do .
nate , brenda , come on in !
we have so many details to go over ... before the bridal shower on sunday .
isn' t it exciting ?
it' s all too much for me .
please , it' s all for you .
i' d rather just cancel it .
are you mad ?
lulu smeigel cancelled her weekend at canyon ranch just to be here .
now , you must try one of these .
it' s made from this incredible liqueur ... that comes from the most poverty stricken village in belize .
it' s delicious !
right .
your trip .
you look like you had a good time .
it was fabulous !
your skin looks good .
did you have some work done ?
not at all .
it' s just happiness .
you should try it sometime .
is billy here ?
no .
when i got back , i found a note saying he' s staying with friends in portland .
but he didn' t leave a number .
brenda , did he give it to you ?
no , he didn' t .
that' s right .
he still has all that raging resentment towards you .
who are you hiding in the bedroom ?
let me guess .
another one of your young south american gigolos ?
not at all , darling .
he' s an aging intellectual from the bronx .
isn' t this fabulous ?
bern and i are back , and better than ever .
so i realized i' d made a terrible mistake , got on the next plane to belize ... and begged your mother to take me back .
come on , be honest , dear .
the whore dumped you .
because i was subconsciously pushing her away ... because i really love you .
the point is , the sex has been incredible .
just like when we first met .
i' il never forget what you were wearing the first time you walked into my office .
the tight givenchy blue skirt with a slit that went right up to my wazoo .
i knew immediately i was gonna have some wildly inappropriate feelings for you .
and , boy , was i right !
mom was one of dad' s patients .
it' s actually kind of disgusting .
i was not a patient .
i was in grad school .
i was an intern .
and the second i lay down ...
i knew i was never gonna get up off that couch .
we terminated therapy after a few months ... and waited the correct amount of time before embarking on a relationship .
at least , that' s what we tell everyone .
i' il give you a hand with that .
okay , what ?
i can' t believe you just took him back .
are you that scared of being alone ?
god , you' re so fucking depressing .
i love your father .
and i' m very happy .
you noticed it yourself .
maybe that' s what' s upsetting you so much , that i' m so happy .
i' m sorry for whatever tensions this engagement is bringing up in you and nate .
but my advice to you ... is get your shit together and don' t blow it with this one .
because you are a major handful .
sorry .
i noticed a coffee stain on the couch .
i was trying to get it out .
you still mad at me about the swordfish ?
you should' ve told me you didn' t like it instead of waiting till i slaved over it .
you' re right .
i should' ve told you .
so why didn' t you ?
because you scare me .
shut the fuck up .
you want everything to be perfect , all the time .
when it' s not , you get upset .
i didn' t get any sleep last night .
i' m too tired for this conversation .
sometimes i feel like if i don' t do or say exactly what you want ... you might decide you don' t want to be with me .
that' s just stupid .
thanks .
when we were together the first time ... it seemed like all our problems stemmed from my not coming out .
they did .
now i think it was just easier for you to make us believe that .
if everything could be blamed on my not coming out ... then nothing ever had to be your fault .
what' s under that arm right here ?
hey , nate !
hey !
say hello to nate .
hello .
you didn' t like that ?
all right .
let' s go .
look , vanessa' s sister , she' s got this publicist ... and the first thing she does is get her invited to some spa thing in long beach .
so ?
so she took vanessa and the baby .
now my sitter' s sick , so here we are .
mrs. hirsch needs to be finished by 1 : 00 .
i have a kid , okay ?
these type of things happen .
anyhow , i gave mrs. hirsch the once over .
she' s a young breast cancer .
piece of cake .
hopefully i' il get a sitter in time to do her .
that' s not good enough .
my hands are tied here , okay ?
unless you take care of julio while i do mrs. hirsch .
no ...
come on , i don' t see you doing anything .
look , i can' t .
i have to clean a buddha .
he looks like he' s asleep .
he' s not .
he' s just blissed out because he has the secret to enlightenment .
what' s " enlightmintz " ?
i guess it' s knowing everything .
my dad knows everything .
well , he knows a lot .
he knows everything .
how much do you know ?
not much .
ruthie ?
did we have plans ?
no .
does that mean i have to go away ?
i do not need my house to smell like fake lemons .
it smells good already .
no , it doesn' t .
i like everything the way it is .
but i don' t .
i thought i would ...
isn' t this fun ?
it' s a surprise sleepover .
okay , let' s do it , sure .
then let' s get started .
okay .
first , we have to get this place into shape , so we can have a nice , cozy , clean evening .
we' re going to wallpaper ?
no , silly .
it' s contact paper for the drawers .
ruthie , why do i want little cherries in my drawers ?
it' s hard to explain .
you just do .
you failed me ?
i' m sorry , claire , but i asked for a literary analysis .
so you didn' t think they were any good ?
that' s not the point .
this is an english class .
i wanted something in english .
so you' d just prefer i download some stupid crap off the internet ... than do something that' s actually creative ?
i don' t have time for this .
would you just do the make over ?
i was really happy with mrs. sibley .
the secret of woman , the soil .
under a mound that you shall never find .
just so you know , i put a lot of myself into this .
i wasn' t just slacking off .
look , i don' t want to fail you .
just give me some kind of paper .
i assume you need to graduate .
you are going to college , right ?
yup , east valley .
really ?
i went there .
david fisher .
hey , it' s me .
hi .
i' m calling to tell you we' re having lunch with taylor and karla on saturday .
you can' t just schedule things without asking me first .
that' s not what couples do .
how would you know what couples do ?
i watch tv .
or at least i used to when i had a comfortable chair to sit in .
listen , i was in the middle of five things at work , okay ?
you know , not everyone can always act so perfect .
yeah , i know that .
that' s what i was trying to tell you last night .
you should check with me before you say yes to things .
are you available ?
yes .
then pretend i asked you first .
so i went the one time , but i' m not going back to dr. michaelson .
are you annoyed ?
no , why would i be annoyed ?
you can do whatever you want .
i' m sure she' s good .
she' s just not for me .
you didn' t tell me she was so serious .
i didn' t realize you were looking for laughs .
i can ask around for more names .
my friend paula' s been to 40 shrinks ... although i guess that' s not the best endorsement for them .
i' m fine .
i think i' m the only one that can solve any of my problems .
yeah , we are ultimately stuck with ourselves .
it' s so fucking puritanical ... how we' re conditioned to buy into the whole true iove monogamy crap .
hey , you' re preaching to the choir .
so i' ve been thinking , the next time that i feel adventurous ... what if i include nate ?
not a bad idea .
you remember terry from orange county i was telling you about ?
she has the lifestyle parties on weekends .
oh , right .
she and her husband are committed .
they have sex with strangers once a week .
they' re really happy .
monogamy just isn' t for everyone .
i know .
look at my parents .
actually , don' t look at them .
that' s what they want .
so maybe we could go to terry' s this weekend and check it out .
yeah , whatever .
i' il give you the address .
i hope you and nate like it .
i don' t want to bring nate .
i mean not yet .
first you and i should go and see what it' s like .
okay , what do you think ?
it feels like a whole new place .
yes , it really does .
who am i kidding ?
i can' t stay here .
i' il never be able to stay here .
it' s too dank .
it will always be dank .
i' m only human .
i can only do so much .
nikolai , this is crazy .
why aren' t you moving into my house ?
i don' t know , it' s ...
why are you acting like we talked about this ?
we haven' t , have we ?
i guess it' s just been on my mind .
i like how things have been for the past few months .
i like seeing you every night and morning .
i don' t want to go backward , do you ?
i love you .
i wish you didn' t sound so sad when you say that .
i wish i wanted to move in with you and be with you all the time .
i want to want that more than anything .
but i don' t .
maybe i am the one with the problem .
maybe i have been alone and cut off for so long ... that i no longer know how to do it .
maybe i am not capable of it .
can' t we go on as we were before accident ?
i think i should go home .
didn' t mom leave any real food for dinner ?
no , there was just a note saying she was gone for the night .
so why aren' t you two with your loved ones ?
late shift .
shiatsu appointment .
what' s this ?
give me that .
it' s this thing for school .
i don' t believe this .
david , look at these .
that' s mrs. steiner .
mr. thomas .
the harrisons .
mr. benson .
mrs. orozco .
god , rico did an amazing job on her .
so do you think they' re any good ?
i think they fucking suck !
do you know what kind of lawsuit this could cause ?
what kind of stupid , fucked up child are you ?
i was trying to do something i gave a shit about .
what' s going on here ?
nate , i heard you yelling .
someone please tell me what' s going on .
nothing .
you were spending the night out .
why are you back ?
that' s none of your business !
hey , got some change ?
fuck you , too !
you' re not listening to me .
i said this shirt feels funny .
it scratches my neck .
too bad .
it' s the only clean one you had ... and i can' t take your uncle' s bitching if he sees one little apple juice stain .
i want to go back and get my yellow one !
i said no .
turn around , now !
you don' t tell me what to do .
mom !
what are you doing ?
we gotta get out of here .
i had no idea east valley was so close to the freeway .
it' s very convenient .
that' s the student center .
that' s where your mailbox will be .
great .
i can go there and get letters from people begging me not to kill myself .
i bet you some famous people went here .
someone like ...
david spade .
okay , there' s way too many flyers with the word " baptist " on them .
look , you can make extra money as a phone sex operator .
yeah , baptist phone sex .
it says here they have a really good arts center .
no , it' s under construction .
it won' t be open till 2004 .
that' s okay .
i need to start being more connected to the real world .
i' m thinking about taking some business courses .
mommy , we have to ...
just shut up .
i need to think .
okay .
nothing there .
i think nothing' s there .
where have i missed ?
i don' t want anyone to find anything .
we have to tell the cops .
no , we don' t !
we just got to pray nobody saw us .
it wasn' t my fault .
we can' t help him now .
we have to tell somebody .
no , we don' t !
god !
i am so tired !
i am so fucking tired of this shit !
why can' t i ever have some fucking peace ?
baby , we can' t tell the cops .
okay ?
they' il take me away from you .
do you want the cops to take me away from you ?
no .
then we don' t tell the cops .
okay ?
this is our little secret .
do you hear me ?
our little secret .
say it .
it' s our little secret .
of course they' re late .
i' ve got a turkey breast drying up .
i' m sorry .
am i boring you ?
no , i didn' t get any sleep last night because you were kicking me for hours .
you know what ?
i have nightmares .
is that my fault , too , like everything else ?
you' re 40 minutes late .
sorry , something came up .
hey , little girl .
fuck , bren , it' s just that it' s saturday night .
you know , i thought we planned to on saturday night ...
yeah , i know you have the shitty shower tomorrow .
all right .
no .
just stay at home and take care of yourself , all right ?
all right , bye .
maybe you shouldn' t jump so hard .
what if he catches us ?
i don' t care .
taylor , that' s enough .
my mom ran over somebody on washington .
what ?
it was an accident .
it was an old , bald white guy .
but we' re not gonna tell anybody .
it' s a secret .
but secrets are so stupid .
people always find out about secrets .
oh , my god .
i was just kidding .
i got you , i got you good .
taylor , that' s not funny .
yes , it is .
this is even more of a shitbox than i remembered .
do you want to get out while there' s time to run ?
are you kidding ?
this is fantastic .
melissa , you made it !
oh , crap .
hey , terry , look at you , girl !
sex is so stupid .
this is like these parties my parents used to have when i was a kid .
there was always this really weird energy in the air .
just like tonight .
oh , yes , the heady haze of expectancy .
everyone got really drunk , got all handsy .
although i don' t think they were official sex parties , like this one .
we should mingle .
this shit' s amazing .
i found it in my kid' s room and beat the crap out of him .
don' t get me started on my kids .
they leave the house at all hours .
i' ve no idea what they' re up to .
if i think about it too hard , i could cry .
you like that ?
why are you getting so upset ?
i' m saying , isn' t it weird that taylor made up this story ?
why didn' t you tell me this earlier ?
because you were going on and on about the coffee stain on your couch .
it was me , okay ?
i did it .
i' m sorry .
it was me .
now shut up already about the coffee stain !
don' t call her .
let' s just forget it .
it' s just this weird thing taylor said .
i' m not calling her , idiot .
hello ?
can i help you ?
hi .
you killed me .
it was about seven years ago , remember ?
you drove lisa to have me killed .
don' t get me wrong .
i don' t harbor any bad feelings or anything .
i' m pro choice .
at least i would be , if i were alive .
you killed me , too .
actually , i was miscarried by the girl who worked at that starbucks on fremont .
i don' t think she was ever planning to tell you about me .
yeah , mom was your first real girlfriend .
then i came along .
you guys offed me and then broke up .
excuse me .
hi , daddy .
hi .
who wants cookies and milk ?
i know the secret to everything .
but you' il never know it , because you killed us .
hit and run at washington and third .
the vehicle' s description matches karla' s car .
the old , bald white guy was dead before he got to cedars .
oh , my god .
what do we do ?
what the hell do you think we do ?
marly and i were fighting night and day .
and then we came to one of these parties .
it was like we rediscovered each other .
and things have been hot between us ever since .
isn' t that such a heartwarming story ?
some people just need a little extra help to stay together , you know ?
there' s nothing wrong with that .
i' m for getting all the help i can get .
marly , show the gals that thing i got you for your birthday .
this has given us another five years .
this sounds good .
should we guess what it is ?
no , i' il tell you .
it' s this little gizmo that he got online at a sex website .
you' ve just got to see it to believe it .
i can' t wait .
i can .
i' m gonna get another drink .
i can' t find it .
i' il just kill myself if i' ve lost that .
why do i lose everything ?
you probably left it in your coat .
i think we left them in that room over there .
i' il just go help marly for a second .
or you could come with us , if you want .
sure , i' il help you .
i just saw mr. srisai' s brother in law put $20 in the casket .
it' s traveling money for his journey .
apparently , unlike the rest of us , buddhists can take it with them .
why am i giving brenda napkin rings ?
because that' s all i had in the gift closet .
hey , they' re allowed to take pictures of the dead guy , but i' m not ?
that' s right .
they' re family .
claire , we' re going to be late .
i can' t believe i have to go to this thing .
all right , look , i' m sorry .
on the plus side ...
i bet it' il take you two sips of punch before you' re completely wasted .
thanks , i' il keep that in mind .
more punch , anyone ?
yeah , sure , i' il take another hit .
that brat' s over an hour late .
for the life of me , i don' t know how she got so damn passive aggressive .
isn' t that just being aggressive ?
are you sick , dear ?
or are you always this deathly pale ?
i' m not late , am i ?
you most certainly are .
ice cold mini asparagus quiche , darling ?
what are they doing with those cups of water ?
it' s a cleansing ritual .
you rid yourself of any wrongs you' ve done to the deceased .
you really think that changes anything ?
pouring a little water into a bowl ?
i don' t know .
maybe .
i have to go .
can you make sure that the monks get home all right ?
and you' il pour the water out from mr. srisai' s bowl ?
you' re supposed to do it over the oldest tree you can find .
i use the one out front .
i don' t know why they bring so many oranges .
but if there are any extra , grab some for the prep room .
this punch is delicious .
your mother made it with a liqueur from belize .
it' s some word with a tilde over the " n .
so what' s new ?
actually , i spent all night ... doing it with this couple from orange county .
and i have absolutely no idea why .
it' s one of those sex things , you know .
lifestyle parties .
i don' t know anything about that .
they had this ...
little high tech japanese vibrator ... that stimulates the clitoris through very low voltage electrical shocks .
anyway , they invited me , you know , to go with them ... and i thought , " now this would be crossing a line .
which i seem to be doing more and more these days .
because you know what ?
the lines are only in our heads .
in actuality , there are no lines at all ... which is really fucking terrifying , if you think about it .
what' s so funny ?
nothing .
everything .
this .
i want you to know something , brenda .
i love you .
i love you , because you are so independent and spirited ... and you make no apologies to yourself .
and you know you can' t smother someone or you' il lose them .
you accept nate as he is , and that is beautiful .
i don' t know how to do that .
not at all .
maybe that' s why i resented you so much .
but now i don' t .
now i admire you .
thank you .
thanks .
i have to go to the bathroom .
claire , are you feeling all right ?
yeah , i' m just tired .
let me feel your forehead .
it feels okay .
i don' t know why you should be tired .
you slept almost 11 hours last night .
i' m not really like want to go to sleep tired .
i' m just sort of like ... sick and tired of everything .
what do you mean ?
just all the lies we' re fed .
the bullshit we' re supposed to care about , how everybody is so scared ... of anything that' s different from everything else .
i don' t know .
i' m gonna get some coffee .
do you want some ?
i have to use the bathroom .
you must be ruth .
bernard chenowith .
oh , hello .
i' m so sorry to startle you .
i was supposed to confine myself to the master suite ... but margaret doesn' t like me to use her bathroom .
she gets insanely territorial about that damn bidet .
it' s nice to finally meet you .
i know .
i don' t know why nate and brenda haven' t arranged a dinner or something .
i could give you half a dozen reasons just off the top of my head !
but i' d like to ask you something .
what steps have you taken to treat your daughter' s depression ?
i have no idea what you' re talking about .
surely you must be aware of it .
now , if you' re adverse to talk therapy , there are scads of pharmaceutical solutions .
either way , i' d be happy to recommend the name of somebody she can see .
i' m sorry .
i have to use the bathroom .
you' re breaking up with me ?
i don' t think we have a healthy friendship .
we shouldn' t see each other anymore .
okay .
i don' t know how else to explain it .
don' t bother , really .
i' m going through something .
i don' t understand what it is ... but i need to be around people who aren' t like you .
people who have clear values , or something .
okay , got it .
if i hadn' t met you , i probably wouldn' t be doing all the shit i' ve been doing .
not that i blame you , exactly .
oh , brother !
just can it , sweetheart .
you can' t stand to see the truth about yourself , so i' ve got to take the fall .
just do me a favor .
when you feel bad about this later ... you can skip the big apology and trying to be friends again .
it was fun , but we should both move on .
so now you know what was really going on with me that night in seattle .
so is the western medicine controlling the seizures ?
not entirely .
and i' m sorry i didn' t tell you about this earlier .
i think i was just trying to not face it myself .
lisa , i' ve changed .
i used to be this person who ran away from responsibility , but i' m not him anymore .
i want to be a part of our child' s life .
i really want to .
i need to .
is this about you being a father for someone ... or is this about you being scared of death ?
does it really matter ?
maybe it doesn' t .
this is going to take some adjusting .
okay , maybe we can work out something .
this is what you want , right ?
absolutely what i want .
it' s not like brenda told you this was the right thing to do , or something .
no .
she doesn' t even know about it .
what ?
nate , you are so ...
this is no good .
i just want to get away from you .
i don' t understand .
what' s going on ?
i was so stupid to think that anything could ever change you .
you don' t want a child , so you agree not to be a part of that child' s life .
then you decide you do want a child , and you say you' il be part of the child' s life ... with a total disregard for the person you' re supposedly sharing a life with .
all i said ...
jesus , nate ... if you can' t put anyone but yourself first , how can you be a father ?
you can' t .
so do us both a favor and stay out of our lives .
please .
