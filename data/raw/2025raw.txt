in your thoughts , i mean .
promise .
hah !
no !
hey .
hey .
bad business , andre .
single woman .
she`s about 32 .
dead maybe 8 or 10 hours .
it`s clearly murder , but there`s no motive we can make out .
wounds are vicious .
looks like a serrated edge .
think she knew the guy ?
there`s no signs of forced entry .
not much of a struggle either .
we`il need shots of the bedroom as well .
and check the bathroom door and the taps for prints .
where`s the child ?
she had a girl , maybe 5 years old .
any sign of her ?
that child was here last night .
we have a murder kidnapping .
and if we don`t move fast , that list will grow .
i`il get you the reports
you`re in charge , cor .
get used to it .
i`ve got a date with my wife .
in the wake of rioting ... which broke out in soweto two days ago ... violence continues to erupt in townships ... with students organizing protests ... against afrikaans as the language of instruction .
in tembisa , a number of schools and administration buildings have been torched .
municipal beer halls and liquor stores have been burned down ... and police have erected roadblocks at all township entrances .
while the anti urban terrorism unit continues to patrol the townships ... all members of the police force have been placed on riot duty alert .
a number of arrests have been made .
what is going to happen , andre ?
the department of bantu education ... has closed all schools in soweto and alexandra .
shotgun .
what`s this ?
live rounds today , no extra charge .
courtesy of the general .
too many of you caught changing the rubber for d cells anyway .
i can feel it , andre .
it`s a bad day .
don`t , cor .
it`il be fine .
it`s rita .
if anything happens to me
of course .
and you`il do the same for me with bekkie , huh ?
yeah .

andre !!
it`s all right !!
come on !

it`s all right .

it`s all right .
harold told me you was coming .
why do the wrong ones keep dying , pa ?
i shot a man today .
speak english , dad , please .
if you hadn`t shot him , what then ?
the riots would continue , sir .
and then ?
maybe they would take power .
eventually they will .
they would kill us , those of us who stayed .
wouldn`t they ?
maybe they`re not like us .
this country would become like the rest of africa impoverished , disease ridden , corrupt .
popular leaders who murder their own people , steal millions from the treasury ... and then go off to die of cancer in swiss clinics .
our blacks have the highest standard of living on the continent .
son , you helped the africans today
by murdering unarmed men ?
unless you call this a weapon .
you can`t avoid riot duty , stander .
no one likes it .
some of them do .
let them do it .
you`ve discussed this with your father ?
he has nothing to do with this .
yes .
riot squad is an important part of your duty , like it or not .
and asking to be relieved from it
you`re making a good name for yourself .
you`re the youngest captain in the force .
you know what this will mean to your career .
i realize what this will mean to me , sir .
for god`s sake .
to you
sorry .
didn`t mean to wake you .
don`t you do this to me .
don`t you dare shut me out .
it`s me .
i wasn`t defending myself .
i wasn`t defending my family .
the only thing i maybe might have been defending ... was my own what ?
reputation .
and even then , it`s not mine .
saving stander face .
holding up my end .
which is a bullshit excuse ...
for my shooting people , killing people .
you`ve got to stop this .
you know , the truly amazing thing is amazing don`t even feel worse than i do .
please ... just
don`t .
please don`t .
oh , for christ`s sake .
where the hell is everyone ?
they`ve all been called up .
that bomb in soweto .
they have to enforce a curfew .
and meanwhile we let everything go to shit here .
you know , a white man could get away with anything today ... while the police are too busy crushing the blacks !
coming for lunch , sir ?
terrifically busy .
thank you .
newspaper .
newspaper .
newspaper .
newspaper .
newspaper .
newspaper .
paper , paper , paper .
hey !!
hey , excuse me !!
did you see what he did ?
he just comes barging in , pushing past .
jesus !!
i mean , we`re a queue here .
we are all waiting .
you`re not the only one in a hurry .
what if we all did that , eh ?
it would be a bit of a mess , wouldn`t it ?
i don`t know .
after all , this is a bank .
you`re supposed to behave yourself .
some gentleman !
no .
no .
no , no , no .
he was wearing wearing a blue suit ... and , um , big sunglasses on his face , big sunglasses .
he had big sunglasses and and a blue suit .
yes , i think
you can drop these at lunchtime tomorrow .
i`il be in meetings all day .
and what are these ?
what`s got into you ?
i blew off some steam .
that`s all i needed .
it won`t happen again .
if these are to make up for a week of nothing but trouble , you can keep your roses .
but it might cost you the bolton .
oh , no .
it`il only take two men .
i didn`t believe him .
only two men .
he said , yeah , two men and a hundred blacks .
a hundred kaffirs .
that`s rich .
what about one man and 200 kaffirs , huh ?
bring it in .
we`il take care of it for you .
thanks very much .
thank you .
going around the corner !
so , he showed the teller the gun ... and apparently threatened to blow his head off if he didn`t hand over the money .
anyone else hear that ? uh , no .
apparently they were quite busy at the time .
and then he exited through the front of the bank , went into the street .
the security guard pursued him , but lost him immediately .
any description ?
evidently the same good looker that hit the first bank .
put out an alert and stake out the downtown banks .
all right .
thanks , guys .
late night , andre .. you' ve been behaving yourself .
any news on the kidnapper ?
i spoke with the informants , but ... ... nothing much is coming back .
keep at it .
the `68 nederburg .
all right .
go ahead .
oh !
oh .
and two of them , andre .
it`s beautiful .
they`re beautiful .
we can`t we can`t afford these .
there were old assets in my family .
i decided it was time to cash in .
well , you certainly did .
it`s time you had something as lovely as you are .
tell me everything`s all right .
everything`s all right .
nothing solid .
he keeps his head down , seems to know where the cameras are .
generic six foot , suit , red hair .
red ?
probably a disguise .
yeah .
right .
i know .
it`s been a bad day .
you okay now ?
i`m sure , miss , you`ve been through this over and over ... but could you tell me exactly what you saw ?
you .
me ?
i mean
i i don`t know what i mean .
it`s just he was , you know ...
like you .
want to take me in , captain ?
i don`t know .
some kind of satisfaction .
fame , maybe ?
well , he`s got our attention .
i`il give him that .
he keeps pushing , raising the stakes , upping the ante .
he`s probably contemplating something daring next .
something big .
the airport .
the foreign exchange windows .
morning flight arrivals .
a thousand foreigners , exchanging dollars , pounds , marks .
the airport , really ?
that`s a stretch .
maybe .
but i got a feeling about this bugger .
a very strong feeling .
take a team , cor .
stake it out .
okay .
yes , that is a firearm , but i don`t intend to use it .
give me all your money .
captain deventer ?
what ?
three ?
in an hour ?
we just got these in .
he`s one smooth oak .
something on your mind , cor ?
you know , andre , if you want to get away ... just you and bekkie , just to let things settle away from this madness ...
i`il cover for you , as long as it takes .
i`il keep that in mind .
as a friend , hey , we all need a change of scenery .
captain stander .
sir , you are under arrest .
i`il have to have your gun , andre .
we`ve had a 90 man team on you , andre .
what took you so long ?
i`m not as good as you .
you`ve gotten better .
could you please just turn around and put your hands behind your back , please ?
the state of bank robberies plaguing the johannesburg area ... could finally come to an end with a surprising arrest .
the suspect in the so called " white collar robber case`" has been captured .
in a startling turn of events ... an arrest was made of none other than johannesburg police captain andre stander .
the extent of the captain`s alleged involvement in the robberies on the reef ... is not determined at this time , though 28 charges are pending .
among them are several counts of robbery , attempted murder , fraud ... illegal possession of firearms , forgery and pottering .
more news after this .
i have three sons who do motorcycle riding .
their clothes are just caked in mud .
does the defense have witnesses ? uh , none .
then do you have a statement , captain stander ... before i consider judgment ?
i`m tried for robbing banks .
but i have killed unarmed people .
that is not the business of this court .
do you have anything more to say ?
no .
the court only attaches importance ...
to the accused`s reckless endangerment of innocent people ...
that he had sworn to his country to protect .
no account is taken of his prior record and commendations .
the court sentences former captain andre stander to 32 years imprisonment .
dirty fucking harry .
he won`t last long .
really ?
who`s got the balls ?
you , lee ?
hey !!
that psycho kidnapper will be out before you .
how does that make you feel , supercop ?
lee mccall .
i used to hit banks ... back home in australia .
you`re not australian , you bastard .
sing the national anthem , then .
wallaby and kangaroo
will ever runnin` be free and ... true
i`m fuckin`no australian  lee mccall .
you`ve been inside 11 of the last 12 years .
bad checks , stolen cars , credit cards .
small time habitual .
hit the bank ?
you`ve never even had an account .
why , it sounds like you know me .
your file crossed my desk ... once .
the car must stay full of petrol .
ask my father to please empty my treasure chest and put the money in the boot .
shift the seat back please , bekk , i may be handcuffed .
i feel like the lowest of the low for asking you these things .
or are you enjoying the adventure ?
how did he get it past them ?
oh , he didn`t .
a friend of mine slipped it to me before the press got hold of it .
he`s a flight risk now .
one letter a month , no visitation rights .
would you have helped him ?
of course .
if he had been caught , the appeal would have been denied .
bekkie , i may be selfish , but that is the only hope i have of seeing him out before i die .
please .
don`t encourage him .
his feelings for you are so strong .
you' re right .. so strong , that he could rob a dozen banks and keep it totally in the dark .
i i should' ve seen it .
oh , bekkie .
there are parts of andre i`m afraid we`il never know .
you didn`t marry him twice .
my friend , cor .
after two years in here , i am an honest man .
i no longer worry that i`m living a lie .
i have more respect for the sorted criminals i find myself amongst ... than i did for the cops i used to know .
thugs , bullies , cut up buggers ... smoking stolen cigars at my very own wedding .
robbed goods paid out in the name of so called protection .
i`d rather rob a bank than accept a gift that was given out of fear .
oh , not for me .
i`ve got a half shoulder .
parachuting accident .
right .
how do you spell parachute ?
eh ?
i don`t know .
hey , asslicker !!

i think you`ve lost your nerve .
i don`t need to prove myself to you .
i was robbing banks years before you .
i robbed my first bank with my finger .
with your finger ?
yeah .
really ?
really .
you swine .
see , i was born to it .
chaos ... ... it`s all i know .
well , allan , when i get out , maybe i`il come back and get you .
thank you , but , uh , that`s not how i see it , andre .

he`s my second .
he`s here to make sure that after i leave , you don`t do anything stupid .
fill it up .
you`re a lovely woman .
look at that , lee .. so much work waiting for us !
well , i take whatever i want to
and , baby , i want you ... previously convicted in a series of bank robberies ... escaped today from custody .
it is suspected that the precisely executed escape ... was planned by stander ... with the assistance of patrick lee mccall .
both men were wearing disguises .
if that is you , andre , then i trust that god will help me to do the right thing .
i`il bet they`re pulling out all the stops to find us .
i can tell you what they`re doing right now .
they`re sitting in a meeting in jo`burg .
smoking fat cigars .
trying to figure out how to handle this without making themselves look ... even more witless than they already are .
bastards .
oh , no , you can`t be serious .
you`re next .
nah .
there`s no need .
cops have got nothing on me .
no photos , nothing .

kenny roberts .
brandon clayton !

you swine !
now , where to , my chinas ?
now what do we do ?
we fuck with the system , we crumble its foundations , and capitalize on the new disorder .
what the fuck is that supposed to mean ?
it means we rob every bank between here and the other side of jo`burg .
whoo !

sir ?
it`s empty .
fill it .

quickly .
the bank`s money or yours ?

oh !
hey !
we`ve been robbed by andre stander , eh !!
andre stander !
oh , that`s something , eh ?
yeah .
we`il just need you to
the rent will be collected on the first of each month .
the water is included but not the electricity .
and we expect the house to be kept in a clean condition .
of course .
do you have any references , mr. clayton ?
how about 2, 000 rand , cash ?
the best for my friends .
tell me , sir , uh , which side do you dress ? uh , well , i usually just pull them straight up like that .
jesus !
we look like bank presidents , not bank robbers !
then , we`il need some wheels to match , eh !
wait !
stop !
extremely high powered , more than capable of 180 , not that i`ve tried it personally .
but the targa is the classic porsche .
there are only four in the country , mr. marshall it is mr. marshall , isn`t it ?
this is the only one in this particularly bright , vibrant color of canary yellow
where the fuck are you going , man ?
i`m just going !
speed , man .
that`s how they got you .
you pushed it too far .
if you go fast enough , you can`t see where you`ve come from .
i just think treating him like any other criminal won`t work .
any other criminal wasn`t captain of detectives .
if we act like we`re desperate to apprehend stander ...
it makes us only look like we`re scared of him .
aren`t we ?
he`s one man .
we`re the damned government .
well , now he`s three  well , whatever .
bring him in .
quietly .
we are in control here , goddamn it !
as you say , sir .
morning , cowboy .
you`re good at collecting money .
give us a hand , eh ?
hi .
come on .
come on .
move it !
hey , lady .
sit down .
back off , huh ?
thank you .
excuse me .
fill her up .
oh !
that`s good .
zip it up .
zip it up .
okay .
very good .
do they pay you much ?
twenty seconds .
took 7, 000 in cash .
but i knew all about their other robberies , so
there`s 25, 000 rand in there .
a downtown bank manager has reported that due to his foresight ...
the gang missed a substantial sum hidden in a secondary safe .
oh !
allan .
it`s 52 degrees on the reef .
in case you have a short memory , this is a fucking robbery .
three banks were robbed in the johannesburg area today .
one of them , twice .
andre stander , the mastermind , brazenly returned to the bank ... and allegedly robbed a second set of its contents .
peace in lebanon is up for debate as the u. s. and france
it must be hard on you , boss ?
yeah .
it is .
very kind of you to ask , harold .
the latest on the stander gang ... is that andre stander look a like , mr. mark jennings ... has been arrested for the third time .
mr. jennings spoke to our reporter today upon his release .
i can`t walk in the streets , i can`t do my business .
i`ve been arrested three times as a stander and not one apology .
not one !
just this morning
oh , poor bugger .
his 15 minutes used up .
it`s enough to drive anybody crazy .
do you fancy going out and stealing a car ?
hey !
hey , andre !
andre !
she`s cool !
she`s my woman !
i love her !
every time you fuck you fall in love !
you understand .
you`re one of us now .
you fuck up , you give us to the cops , you`re dead !
like that .
that was nice .
she`il turn on us , she`il turn on him ... the first time she`s pushed .
hey , don`t take any notice of him , huh ?
he`s just jealous `cause you`re my chickie , eh ?
come here , my little talia .
don`t worry .
come on .
tarzan take you back to bed now .
huh ?
i`ve been in twice .
she`s seen me too much .
you do this one , you two .
she has a lot of firepower at her fingertips , andre .
it`il be easy .
lee , you distract her .
send her to the back for beretta rifles .
allan , hop over the counter , ready for her return .
don`t worry , allan .
i`il protect you .
may i help you ?
do you have any beretta rifles ? uh , yes .
yes , we do .
would you like the deluxe or standard ?
right .
and so , what`s the difference ?
well , the deluxe is checkered , the standard isn`t .
checkered meaning ?
it`s like an engraving .
oh , is it ?
yeah .
well , i think then , uh , probably the deluxe is what i`m looking for .
all right .
let me just check the back for you .
right .
great , thank you .
fuck !
it`s glass .
hop over the counter .
fuck !
it`s in the fucking details , andre .

" police have set up a special task force .
gentlemen , we have graduated to task force .
a nerve center in yoeville

i mean , what the fuck are we doing , huh ?
i mean , we`re riskin` our necks when they know we are coming ... and you`re giving the fuckin` money away .
i mean , what`s the point , eh ?
what`s the fuckin` point  shut up .
take it easy , relax .
it`s cool .

i don`t need to set a bank robbing record .
leave him in the van next time .
fuck him .
lee .
don`t need him .
lee .
this is supposed to be fun , huh ?
you know it`s not often that houses like this come on the market .
he can`t be serious !
in our top story , police have deployed extra officers ... at bank branches in the wake of five bank robberies , all last friday ... attributed to the stander gang .
here`s what you had to say .
you know , uh ... he`s just doing what a lot of people wish they could do .
he`s got nerve .
i`il give him that .
how about some personal credit here ?
they even repeat the same bank .
we`il announce ourselves as the heyl gang next time .
that would be very nice , andre .
and they have courage .
and i think he`s really inventive .
you`re obviously not the only ones who enjoy seeing the tables turn , eh ?
the premier of the soviet union has died .
right , allan .
that`s why we`re bigger news than the head of fucking russia .
jesus !
you scared the shit out of me .
sorry about that .
i had to make sure we were alone .
it`s different now .
i`m different .
so i`ve read .
always different , never the same .
what`s changed , andre ?
money .
money solves a lot of problems , bekkie .
got plenty of that .
we can go anywhere .
anywhere in the world .
anywhere but here , right ?
what about my life ?
what about my freedom ?
freedom ?
there`s no freedom here .
there`s two choices either become them ... or you live at odds with everything around you .
i don`t want that for you .
we`il start over .
america .
new i. d.
your dreams can come true .
i`il make them happen .
well , that`s very glamorous , andre .
but unlike you , i look terrible in a black wig and glasses .
i`m quite fine , thank you very much , in my quiet little life .
i want to take you with me .
i promised , remember ?
don`t start .
you`re everything to me .
all i`ve ever wanted .
i had everything i wanted .
everything .
bekk .
the things they say about me
i`m not stupid , andre .
there`s not a thinking man among us ... that doesn`t want to blow this place to smithereens from time to time .
but we don`t .
we find other ways .
i won`t make it without you .
i need to be left alone .
oh , jesus !
you love me .

everyone`s dishonest .
just a matter of degree .
he would have taken less .
why hit the man when he`s down ?
it would bring us bad karma in our new life .
had enough of that in my old one .
you know what got me started on all of this ?
are you saying it wasn`t greed , allan ?
it was a girl .
a black girl .
she wasn`t mine , but ...
i loved her .
i really loved her .
i was a student at teacher training college .
i was full of politics , full of hope .
she was pregnant , not by me .
i shouldn`t have been with her .
but the fucking cops
they came into where we were .
they saw us together .
they beat us .
they beat the baby out of her .
so i robbed a store to get her money to go to england .
and it was easy .
too easy .
taking down those banks ... fucking with those bastards .
