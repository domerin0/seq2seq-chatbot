they were fake ?
of course they were fake !
this is what a real mustache looks like .

what are you gonna do to us ?
plankton was very specific .
plankton ?
for some reason , he wanted me to step on you .
step on us ?
yeah !
that way you' il never find out that he stole the crown !
perhaps i' ve said too much .
that' s a big boot .
don' t worry .
this will only hurt a lot .
i love this job !
bigger boot !
wait , pat .
this bigger boot saved our lives .
thank you , stranger .
stranger ?

he' s making a humorous diorama of ... ... alexander clam bell ?
patrick , he' s killing sea animals and making them into smelly knickknacks .
and i think we' re next .

the heat is so intense from this lamp that i can' t move .
tell me about it .
this doesn' t look too good , patrick .
you mean we' re not gonna
get the crown , save the town and mr. krabs ?
i don' t even think we' re gonna be able to save ourselves , buddy .
thanks .
don' t mention it .
well , it looks like what everybody said about us is true , patrick .
you mean that we' re attractive ?
no , that we' re just kids .
a couple of kids in way over their heads .
we were doomed from the start .
i mean , look at us .
we didn' t even come close to the crown .
we let everybody down .
we failed .
shell city .
yeah , we never made it to shell city .
shell city .
exactly , buddy .
yeah , the place we never got to .
shell city .

eugene krabs , your six day reprieve is up , and it is time for you to die .

there is nothing else i can do .
you can give spongebob and patrick a little more time .
except give spongebob and patrick a little more time ...

no , no , no !
oh , spongebob , wherever you are , you better hurry .
okay , fellas , this is where you get off .
bikini bottom' s directly below .

all hail plankton .
all hail plankton .
spongebob , what happened ?
plankton cheated .
cheated ?
hold on there , baldy .
oh , grow up .
what , you think this is a game of kickball on the playground ?
you never had a chance to defeat me , fool .
and you know why ?
because you cheated ?
no , not because i cheated .
because i' m an evil genius .
and you' re just a kid .
a stupid kid .
i guess you' re right , plankton .
i am just a kid .
of course i' m right .
okay , neptune , time to kill .
and you know , i' ve been through a lot in the past six days , five minutes , 27 and a half seconds .
and if i' ve learned anything during that time , it' s that you are who you are .
that' s right .
okay , neptune ...
a kid .
that' s great .
now , get back against the wall .
but that' s okay .
what ?
what' s going on ?
because i did what everyone said a kid couldn' t do .
i made it to shell city , and i beat the cyclops , and i rode the hasselhoff , and i brought the crown back .
all right , we get the point .
so , yeah , i' m a kid .
and i' m also a goofball .
and a wing nut .
and a knucklehead mcspazatron !
what' s going on here ?
but most of all , i' m ...
okay , settle down .
take it easy .
i' m ...
i' m ...
what the scallop ? !
i' m a goofy goober
you' re a goofy goober
we' re all goofy goobers
goofy , goofy , goober , goober
put your toys away well , all i gotta say
when you tell me not to play i say no way
no way !
no , no freaking way
i' m a kid , you say when you say i' m a kid
i say , " say it again " and then i say thanks
thanks !
thank you very much
so if you' re thinking that you' d like to be like me
go ahead and try the kid inside will set you free
i' m a goofy goober
what' s happening ?
his dance moves are impressive , but i' m in control .
seize him !
all hail plankton .
i' m free .
i' ve been freed !
what ?
no !
my precious helmets !
his chops are too righteous .
the helmets can' t handle this level of rock ' n ' roll .
karen , do something .
karen ?
all right , that' s the last straw .
neptune , i command you to ...
here you go , daddy .
i better get out of here .
look , it' s the wizard who saved us .
out of my way , fools .
come on , i was just kidding .
come on , you guys knew that , didn' t you ?
with the helmets and the big monuments ...
wasn' t that hilarious , everybody ?
i will destroy all of you !
well , mindy , i have to admit , you were right .
your compassion for these sea creatures proved a most admirable trait .
without it , i would have never again seen my beloved crown .
i think you' re going to make a fine ruler of the sea one day .
now , let' s go home .
daddy , haven' t you forgotten something ?
what ?
oh , yeah .
eugene krabs , i forgot to unfreeze you .
what the ... ?
i guess i had it set to " real boy " ending .
oh , i' m sorry for falsely freezing you , krabs .
and may i say , sir , you are a very lucky fellow to have in your employ such a brave , faithful and heroic young lad .
where is he , anyway ?
i' m up here .
i' m on it .
go to him now , krabs .
embrace him .
spongebob , me boy , i' m sorry i ever doubted you .
that' s a mistake i won' t make again .
oh , mr. krabs , you old soft serve .
and now , spongebob , i' m gonna do something that i should' ve done six days ago .
mr. squidward , front and center , please .
i think we all know who rightfully deserves to wear that manager pin .
i couldn' t agree more , sir .
hooray for spongebob !
wait a second , everybody .
there' s something i need to say first .
i just don' t know how to put it .
i think i know what it is .
after going on your life changing journey , you now realize you don' t want what you thought you wanted .
what you really wanted was inside you all along .
are you crazy ?
i was just gonna tell you that your fly is down .
manager !
this is the greatest day of my life !
you know , david hasselhoff is a great artist .
excuse me , sir .
you folks have to leave .
what ?
say that again , if you dare .
you folks have to leave .
okay .
