why ?
objects may appear larger .
that' s a good one .
anyway .
oh , that' s a good one .
i heard that in the beauty shop this morning .
but seriously .
dee ?
huh ?
that other thing we were talking about before .
come on .
i mean , he can' t just ignore you all night , stay glued to the tv like some zombie ... and then expect you to turn it on like a lightbulb .
i mean , i wouldn' t put up with that .
i mean , you' re either interesting or you' re not .
ask him to decide .
can i write that down ?
all right .
i' m either interesting or i' m not .
he' il shit a brick .
hmm .
what if he says i' m not ?
he won' t say that you' re not .
trust me .
okay , i did it .
i told chaim i wasn' t moving to israel .
yeah , good .
and ?
i said what you said .
he can be a writer anywhere .
if i' m going to be in advertising , i need to be here and not there .
and then he said ?
i don' t know .
it was in hebrew .
ooh .
but i don' t think it was , " you got it .

but thank you , anyway .
this was fun .
aww !
huh .
this is good .
more insightful than i would' ve thought .
this line doesn' t feel exactly right .
if you' re thinking that line isn' t perfect , i agree .
it needs work .
there' s something not exactly right about it , isn' t there ?
i mean , it' s not bad .
it' s insightful , actually .
it' s just
well , what do you think this woman' s thinking ?
uh , well , i
let' s see .
uh , she' s thinking about what she wants out of life .
what' s she gonna accomplish ?
how' s she gonna do all that ?
women , you know , they think about that a lot .
i mean , surprisingly a lot .
they worry all the time about everything .
you' re so right .
how do you know that ?
well , you know , even i had a mother .
well
so maybe running gives her time off from all of that .
it gives her something she can' t get anyplace else .
look at her .
god .
i want to be her .
she looks so free , doesn' t she ?
no one' s judging her , no boss to worry about , no guys to worry about , no games to figure her way through .
i like that .
no games .
that' s good .
that' d be nice in life , wouldn' t it ?
okay , can i just think for one second ?
take your time .
okay .
okay .
no games .
how do i get that in ?
she' s running .
it' s early , it' s quiet .
just the sound of her feet on the asphalt .
she likes to run alone .
no pressure , no stress .
this is the one place she can be herself .
look any way she wants , dress , think any way she wants .
no gameplaying , no rules .
games , sports , rules .
games , sports , rules .
playing by the rules .
playing games versus playing
playing by the rules .
playing games versus playing
why are you nodding ?
because you' re onto something .
am i ?
aren' t you ?
well , i was thinking about a play on words .
something about games versus
i feel like i was onto something good .
playing games versus playing  sports ?
yes !

a lot .
i like the idea that you can be yourself on the road .

no , i was just

i didn' t think anyone else was still here .
i didn' t know anyone was here .
what time is it ?
it' s after 1 0 : 00 .
i didn' t realize it was so late .
i feel so alone .
um i didn' t catch that .
sorry ?
i didn' t realize how late it was .
and i' m glad you' re here .
i' m stuck .
i feel so alone .
you want a hand with this ?
no , thanks .
i' m okay .
yeah , i' m not buying it .
what' s going on ?
well , i have an early meeting tomorrow with dan , and i wanted to make it later so i could be more prepared .
but then you slipped in there and took the only time he had left , which left me with 8 : 15 tomorrow morning .
it' s fine .
i' m just not as ready as i wish i was .
sorry .
you didn' t do it on purpose .
i just don' t want him to be disappointed .
hey , why don' t we go through some of these together ?
really ?
i insist .
unless you' re too tired .
oh , no .
i' m not tired .
yeah , i can see that .
it' s just so far beyond tired at this point .
i' ve basically stopped sleeping ever since i took this job .
you have ?
yeah , it' s weird .
i , um how do i say this ?
you don' t feel quite like yourself here , do you ?
no , i don' t .
not yet , anyway .
boy .
plus , i' m mad that i' m getting sick .
i never , ever get sick .
in fact , you don' t have to sit so close to me if you don' t want to .
no , come here .
i' il brave it .
so , where do we kick off ?
control top panty hose ?
okay .
personally , i think they do the trick .
you' ve worn control top panty hose ?
did you put a pair in the box ?
seriously ?
oh , yeah .
you are full of surprises .
yeah .
no , no , no .
i mean that as a compliment .
i love that .
and how did you look in them ?
ooh .
hot .
my daughter and her boyfriend walked in , and i got ' em on with
and they said what when they saw you in your panty hose ?
it was the turquoise wonderbra they noticed .
then , the nail polish .
the dress you picked out is totally hideous .
i' m not coming out .
it can' t be that bad .
come on out .
i look like a nun an ugly nun .
why ?
because it' s gray ?
gray is the new black .
if he says he likes it , i' il die .
okay , next .
this , i love .
thank you .
next .
i think this is the one .
i like that no , i love that .
okay , this is it .
let me take a look .
yes !
i look older .
this is great .
oh , god , i need boobs .
oh , i' il buy a padded bra when he' s not around .
i can' t believe this is what i' il be wearing the last night i' m a virgin .
or what i' il be taking off .
alex ?
hmm ?
i wanna talk to you about something that' s pretty important .
i' ve never talked to you about  oh , god .
he' s actually gonna try to be a dad .
this should be hilarious .
i realize i haven' t been the perfect dad .
understatement of the century .
can you pass the bread ?
yeah , sure , sure .
but that does not mean i don' t have the right ... to talk to you about about
about ?
all right .
you' re a young woman now , and you may be flirting with the idea of of
having sex ?
um , can i get a lemonade , please ?
well , you know , boys and girls think very differently about sex .
my hunch is girls just want guys to like ' em and hang out with ' em .
whereas guys and not all guys , allright ?
but most guys , they pretty much just wanna have sex .
okay , i' m what i' m trying to say here is ,
i don' t want you to feel pressured ...
because your boyfriend' s older .
please .
save it .
mom had this talk with me when i was , like , 11 .
you' re supposed to have sex when you' re in love and it' s special .
i know everything .
and mom knows me for real and knows my friends and cameron , so let' s leave the parental talks up to her , okay ?
i promised cameron i' d do it .
oh , jeez .
and also , let' s not make me part of this nick makeover ... or whatever this new thing you' re into is , okay ?
what new thing ?
what new thing ?
this ridiculous new guy you' re trying to be .
clowning around with me ?
asking if we can make a salad ?
watch friends together ?
i mean , it' s nuts after 15 years of no relating .
i mean , come on .
who are you to talk about relationships anyway ?
you never had a real relationship with anyone in your entire life .
look , i' m supposed to meet my friends .
so i' m gonna go , okay ?
sure .
thanks for the dress .
she didn ' t even finish her lunch .
johnny come lately , giving her advice ?
oh , teenagers .
i think the talk worked .
she' s totally right .
move on , dude .
it' s over .
please .
now you' ve seen how the cake is assembled .
the next time you admire a wedding cake , you' il be able to appreciate
wow .
it looks so gorgeous .
fit , vibrant hair .
oh .
i hated being overweight .
i always wanted to be thin and pretty ... and wear cute little clothes .
it built and it built , and my health deteriorated .
and i couldn ' t walk and i couldn ' t stand ... to even stand up at the park for ten minutes while my kids played .
i tried sitting on the swings , and the chains cut my hips and it hurt .
and i couldn' t i couldn ' t run and i couldn ' t move .
and i was tired and i wanted to be a good mom .
what the hell' s wrong with me ?
hello ?
what am i doing ?
darcy ?
how did you know it was me ?
i didn' t say anything .
i , uh , just sensed it .
shit .
i' m such an idiot .
i didn' t think he' d be there .
excuse me ?
i didn' t mean to really call you .
i had your number here , and i was thinking of you .
thinking of calling you .
obviously , i did call you .
oh , no , that' s all right .
i , uh
i was thinking about you too .
well , here' s to another great idea .
what , " let' s meet for a drink " ?
yes .
yeah ?
exactly what i wanted to say .
sometimes i think you' re a bit of a mind reader .
but i don' t have to be a mind reader with you .
hmm .
you always say what you think .
i know .
it' s a curse .
what
are you kidding ?
it' s a relief an enormous relief .
do you know how rare that is to actually say what you think ?
do you have any idea how rare it is for someone to actually like that ?
trust me , this has not been a great thing in my life .
my ex husband didn' t love me .
let' s just put it that way .
he didn' t love you ?
did i just say that ?
oh , god !
um , i meant to say " it .
he didn' t love it that i spoke my mind .
if you wanna know the truth , i' m not sure he did really love me .
ooh .
there' s a conversation starter .
god .
a smart person would just get so very drunk now .
how long were you married ?
a little less than a year .
i' ve been divorced about nine months now .
we worked together .
you know that , right ?
oh , yeah .
i knew that .
i heard it .
hmm .
what was that like ?
it was great in the beginning .
but it changed .
it became competitive .
suddenly , the better i did , the worse we did .
the price i pay for being me .
i know that now .
no , truly .
oh .
no , no , it' s true .
do you wanna know all this about me ?
keep going .
well , that' s why i needed to get out there on my own , as scary as it was .
i mean , not scary , but , um
well , yeah , i was kind of scared .
why ?
i don' t know .
i guess i wasn' t sure i could do the job .
i mean , i thought i could do it , but i' m finding sloane curtis a tougher place than i thought .
i' m sorry .
i know you were up for my job .
no .
i' m sorry i' m the one that got it .
i' m i' m not .
i' m not .
i' ve learned a lot from you .
like what ?
like what ?
for starters , you really love what you do .
you really love what you do .
not as much as you do .
how can you say that ?
you' re so great at it .
you' re so great at it .
i think dan' s even wondering why he hired me .
really .
i think the bloom is definitely off the rose .
you wanna hear something really great ?
yeah .
i just closed escrow on my first apartment ever .
finally , i own my own place .
what ?
i wish i was a mind reader .
no .
i was just thinking ...
how men like me can get so screwed up .
i don' t think there are men like you .
if we kissed , would it ruin everything ?
listen to me .
i think ... you are one of the great women .
i really do .
i' m sorry .
but i just meant to say thank you .
i' m so sorry .
well , i , uh , guess i' il see you ... in , let' s see , three and a half hours .
nick , may i just say ... you are an exceptionally great kisser .
no , i mean really , really great .
well , i haven' t had this much fun making out since
i' ve never had this much fun making out .
me either .
don' t let this get weird at work ?
no .
we have nothing to be embarrassed about .
we made out .
you and i made out .
and if i may , it was  sexy as hell .
god .
that' s just what i was about to say .
but i think i said it first , i think .
oh , no , you did .
oh .
um , well , all right , then .
oh , i' m a grown woman .
just say it .
do you want to come back to my place ?
say it !
do you want to come
good night , darcy .
good night .
good night .
what am i doing ?
lola .
it' s okay .
okay .
here he comes .
lola ?
i know i haven' t heard from you .
lola , how long have you been out here ?
just a few ... hours .
nick , you said that you wouldn' t hurt me .
and then you slept with me , and then you didn' t call me for six days .
so that , in the world of me , that' s torture .
i mean , we have this totally unbelievable , life altering sex , and then you just disappear .
i mean , you you you stopped drinking coffee !
lola , i' m so sorry .
it' s okay .
it' s okay , because i figured out your little secret .
you did ?
it' s so obvious .
how else would you know the things that you know ?
it wasn' t obvious to anybody else .
nick , come on .
you' re so sensitive .
you' re so aware of my feelings .
you' re so tuned in .
you talk to me like a woman , you think like a woman .
nick !
come on !
admit it .
you' re totally and completely gay .
i am ?
you' re not ?
oh !
i mean , if you' re not , you gotta tell me .
based on the other night just put me out of my misery .
are you or aren' t you ?
say you' re gay .
then i' m not nuts .
i' m not undesirable .
not rejected by another guy !
say it !
say you' re gay !
admit it !
okay .
i' m gay .
how gay ?
oh !
i' m as gay as it gets .
you' re gonna make some guy very happy someday .
oh , from your lips .
god , i hate that i' m crying .
well , look it .
if things should ever change in that department
you' il be the first to know .
you promise ?
oh , yeah , i promise .
come here .
oh , boy .
it was very nice meeting you , nick .
and you .
thanks for pep talk , yes ?
you two just take care of each other .
and thanks for the yarmulke .
oh , no problem .
you wear it well , yes ?
happy trails , kids .
isn' t he great ?
darcy !
i need to talk to you .
uh oh , look at him .
i knew it .
he is weird about it .
this is not about last night .
it' s about the nike meeting .
and i honestly believe in my gut ...
that you should make the pitch .
oh , god .
i guilted you into this last night .
no , no .
it would be better if you did it .
no , no , no .
this is your baby .
you' ve gotta do it .
i gotta go meet and greet these folks .
i' il see you in there .
it' s not my baby .
yes , it is .
i predict no one will even know i' m gone until the files start to build .
it could be days .
and then someone will finally ask ,
where' s the geek in the glasses who carries all the files ?
do either of you two know what the story is on this erin girl ?
miss lonely hearts ?
who knows ?
yeah .
ooh , i know .
she' s been here two years .
she tried to be a copywriter but got turned down .
so she got stuck as a messenger .
what fool turned her down ?
you did , sire .
well , did i ever meet with her at least ?
i don' t think so .
as i recall , you told me to " blow her off .
well , i wanna meet with her now .
the kid' s got something .
she' s kind of funny .
this is your lucky day .
i just saw the nike group get off the elevator .
all women .
your specialty .
come on .
i' il walk you up .
i hate what i' m doing to darcy .
i hate it !
i' m gonna write her a long letter , confess everything .
you' re doing darcy ?
since when ?
no !
i said i hate what i' m doing to darcy .
men are stupider .
it' s true .
will you stop it ?
they are .
" they " ?
are you a woman now ?
oh , i wish .
a woman wouldn' t have screwed over the woman she loved .
no , they don' t think that way .
and another thing .
this thing about penis envy .
yeah .
not true .
no .
they don' t envy it .
half of' em don' t even like it .
you know who has penis envy ?
we do .
that' s why we cheat and screw up and lie , because we' re all obsessed with our own equipment .
you ready ?
okay .
yeah .
thanks .
you don' t stand in front of a mirror before a run ... and wonder what the road will think of your outfit .
you don' t have to listen to its jokes and pretend they' re funny .
it would not be easier to run if you dressed sexier .
the road doesn' t notice if you' re not wearing lipstick .
it does not care how old you are .
you do not feel uncomfortable ... because you make more money than the road .
and you can call on the road whenever you feel like it , whether it' s been a day ... or even a couple of hours since your last date .
the only thing the road cares about ... is that you pay it a visit once in a while .
nike .
no games .
just sports .
he nailed it .
they hit a home run .
where do we sign ?
why are you not the happiest guy in chicago right now ?
you just did so great .
no , no , i didn' t do so great .
we did so
no , actually , you did so great .
you .
you , me .
we did great !
will you come with me someplace ?
i wanna show you something .
i have something i need to finish .
please ?
please .
okay .
here you go .
come with me .
all right .
should i close my eyes or anything ?
no .
so , you see those top two floors right there ?
i do .
all mine .
wow .
come here .
so this is my
living room .
it' s beautiful .
what are you thinking ?
you' ve got that look you have sometimes .
yeah ?
no .
i was just wondering when you get to move in .
well , they said two weeks , so
okay .
this is the dining room .
the fireplace works .
come here .
wow .
i can see elegant parties in here .
waiters with caviar ,
you in a beautiful gown .
you can see all that ?
maybe you' re naked and i' m the only guest , but it' d still be elegant .
okay .
so this is upstairs .
there' s a second bedroom or a future office or whatever .
and this is my boudoir .
your boudoir comes with pretty decent music .
it does .
where is that coming from ?
let' s turn up the volume .
so , where' s your bed going ?
uh , right ... here .
so , if you had a bed , we' d be dancing on it .
i like it here .
i like it here too .
no .
i mean , i like it here .
oh .
believe me , we' re as excited as you are .
dan ?
i gotta talk to you .
yeah ?
he' il be there .
bye .
i gotta talk to you too .
that was nike .
they' re gonna announce to the trades that we won the account .
i gotta hand it to you .
you saved my ass .
you saved the company' s ass .
actually , dan , i had very little to do with saving anybody' s ass .
it' s darcy you should be thanking , that' s what i want to talk about .
darcy ?
please .
i was there .
the girl didn' t open her mouth .
look , i' m a big enough man to admit when i screw up .
i looked at the marketplace and i panicked .
nick , forgive me .
i want you to step in here .
no , no , no , no .
dan , you did the right thing when you hired her .
i mean , she is the best creative director i have ever seen , bar none .
this isn' t about she' s adorable .
oh , yeah , she is .
but this isn' t about that ?
no , no .
not like that .
no , no .
please .
look .
i' ve been doing a lot of listening lately .
and i' ve decided ...
i need to take a leave of absence .
i need to get away from here and get some perspective on things .
what are you , nuts ?
what is this ?
what do you mean ?
this is the biggest account this company has ever landed .
do you want me to have nobody running the shop ?
what are you talking about ?
darcy' s here .
for somebody who listens a lot , you don' t hear so well .
i had a meeting with her today .
i sat her down .
we had a talk .
oh , dan !
you didn' t .
tell me you didn' t fire her .
she didn' t even put up a fight .
oh , dan , no !
hey , she' s gone , pal .
no , no .
it' s not too late .
look , call her .
tell her you need her back , you made a mistake .
hire her back .
hey , calm down .
i can' t do that .
why ?
because i talked to the board and i told them i don' t need her anymore .
oh !
they offered her a settlement .
besides , nike says they want you .
you' re what they bought .
i got a delivery can i
would you come out for one second ?
let me tell you something .
my job is to deliver you .
dan , nike bought an idea .
it wasn' t even mine .
every good idea that they loved yesterday came from her .
and if you don' t get darcy mcguire back in here , and i mean pronto , the board is gonna be paying you your settlement .
this is all about saving your ass , right ?
save it .
annie , get a hold of darcy' s address and number as quick as possible .
yeah , sure .
where' s the girl in glasses ?
erin ?
i don' t think she' s in today .
did she call in sick ?
i don' t think so .
didn' t show up .
oh , where does she live ?
does anyone know where erin lives ?
who' s erin ?
and then someone will finally ask ,
where' s the geek in the glasses who carries all the files ?
hey .
yeah .
did you get a hold of darcy ?
no ?
keep trying .
and when you get a hold of her , tell her to stay put .
i' m coming right over .
i just have to make a little stop on the way .
do you know where this is ?
down the alley .
just down the alley .
thanks .
come on , erin .
be there .
please
erin ?
hello ?
no , no .
dear mom
mr. marshall !
mr. marshall ?
yes , erin .
yes , it' s me .
i' m sorry .
i really did not mean to scare you .
okay ?
i just wanted to come and see how you are .
how are you ?
mr. marshall , if you' re here because i didn' t show up today , i' m sorry .
i was just about to call .
i swear .
no , i' m not here because you didn' t show up for work .
but i' m here well , i
i bet you' re wondering why i am here , huh ?
as a matter of fact , i was just thinking that .
i was thinking , " why is mr. marshall here in my bedroom ?
you were ... thinking that just now ?
yeah , in my head .
i must have water in my ears or something .
but you' re , you know , not thinking anything now , are you ?
i' m thinking a million things .
really ?
because , you know , usually i can , uh
i can , uh
you are thinking something right this minute ?
mr. marshall , i am thinking that you are crazier than i am .
i think
i think i lost
it' s gone .
i' m back .
i' m back .
mr. marshall ?
yeah ?
i' m sorry .
is there something i can maybe do for you ?
no .
no , erin , uh
actually , i came here to see if i could do something for you .
for me ?
yeah .
see , the truth is
the truth
erin , the truth is ,
i' m glad i got here before you did anything to hurt yourself .
what makes you think that i would , uh , do something to hurt myself ?
i just sensed it .
really ?
you could sense that ?
well , that' s not that' s not good .
yeah .
but the real reason i' m here is because
well , here' s the thing .
the real reason i' m here is because

cameron and his friends , they had this big plan .
they rented this hotelroom and and
it was like a suite .
basically , i promised him that i was gonna
i can' t believe i' m gonna say this to you .
i promised him that i was gonna ... sleep with him after the prom .
and like an hour ago , we were on the dance floor and i said ,
i' m sorry , cameron .
you know , i' m just not ready .
good .
good girl .
dad , come on !
i' m sorry , i' m sorry .
go on .
then he goes , " well , the limo , the room and the tux , it all cost me 400 bucks .
and i said , " i' m sorry .
i' m just not
and he cuts me off and he says ,
i never should' ve asked a sophomore to the prom .
what a waste .
then two seconds later , he goes and meets up with his old girlfriend ... and starts making out with her .
i mean , this disgusting slut with a tongue ring .
and then they were laughing and
i just can' t go out there ever .
oh , honey , i' m so proud of you .
dad !
what are you doing ?
i' m sorry .
i' m i' m sorry .
but i am .
and believe it or not ,
i know what it' s like to be a woman .
i mean , it' s not as easy as it looks .
you stood up for yourself .
you know how ahead of the game you are ?
anyway , a guy that treats you like that and talks to you like that ,
he' s not  worth my time .
yes , i know .
it' s true .
he' s not .
he' s a gameplayer , i hate that .
you are so much smarter than me .
and look at you .
that clown made out with a girl with a tongue ring over you ?
honey ... you look beautiful .
thanks .
take me home , dad .
what am i doing ?
she' s not in the refrigerator .
i wonder if it' s too late to go over there .
no , it' s not too late .
it' s never too late to do the right thing .
that' s what i' il do .
i' il go over there and i' il do the right thing .
hello ?
uh , hi , it' s me .
oh , i' m glad i found you .
uh
can i come up ?
darcy ?
i need to
hey .
you need to what ?
it' s 1 : 00 in the morning .
i need to talk to you .
okay .
thanks .
so , you sleep here now ?
i thought i might as well give it a try before i have to sell the place .
sell it ?
you' re not selling the place .
can' t afford to keep it .
i don' t have a job .
you know , you ought to try returning some of your phone calls .
you got your job back .
oh , do i ?
you' re a riot .
you know that ?
it' s true .
dan told me so himself .
why would he tell you that ?
i didn' t do the job he hired me to do .
even i don' t blame him for firing me .
look , i' m , uh you can come on in .
i don' t have any chairs , but if you wanna
what if i told you that ... you did everything that you were hired to do everything but that someone was sabotaging you ?
picking your brain , swiping your ideas and
well , you you never even knew what hit you .
how is that possible ?
oh , trust me , it' s possible .
well , who would do such an awful thing ?
i would .
i was a dope with a corner office .
and when you came with the job i was supposed to have ,
i mean , it didn' t matter to me that ... you were better at it than me or you earned it more than i did .
as far as i was concerned , it was mine , and i was gonna get it back .
so i took advantage of you in the worst possible way .
have you ever done that ?
taken the wrong road and no , of course you haven' t .
you wouldn' t do that .
that' s just
somebody like me does that .
and , uh
the problem with that was that while i was digging the hole under you ...
i found out all about you .
and the more i found out ... the more you dazzled me .
i mean , shook my world , changed my life , dazzled me .
and guys like that ex husband of yours , he made you feel that ... the price you pay just for being you ... is that you don' t get to have love .
isn' t that what you were trying to say the other night ?
that you weren' t complete ?
that you weren' t really a winner ?
everything about you how smart you are , how good you are everything just makes me want you even more .
oh , wow .
boy .
so it looks like i' m here at 1 : 00 in the morning ... being all heroic trying to rescue you , but the truth is ...
i' m the one that needs to be rescued here .
i sure wish i could read your mind .
well , i was thinking that , um , if everything you' re saying is true , if i really have my job back ...
then i think you' re fired .
well , i never i never really thought about it from that angle .
well , not that i don' t deserve it .
i do do
i' m stuttering .
now i feel kind of , uh , embarrassed that i told you i needed to be rescued .
but that' s that' s fine .
that' s it ?
i don' t want that to be it .
i don' t want that to be it at all .
then don' t let a little thing like me firing you stand in your way .
i didn' t know what to react to first .
hey , news flash .
i took the wrong road .
what kind of knight in shining armor would i be ... if the man i love needs rescuing ... and i just let him walk out my door ?
my hero .
