grasse .
near cannes , in the hill side .
awful not to know such a thing !
i didn' t know ...
everybody there work for the perfume industry .
when i was a kid , with my brother , we were apprentices at the distillery .
every day , we picked violets ...
wasn' t very hard job to do ...
not hard but you have to get up at four in the morning ...
they have to be picked before the sun appears .
and when there are no more violets ...
then you can use chemistry ...
solo for instance ...
what is " solo " ?
i made it , don' t you know its name ?
maybe " college " , or " variance " ?
why do you laugh ?
i don' t know , all that , this job ...
this job ...
it' s an industry you know , a huge industry ...
college " , the one with the bottle looking like an inkpot ?
that' s it .
i used some when i was in spain .
what did you think about ?
expensive !!!
price was not my job !
what do you mean ?
i read on a newspaper ...
they say you' re very good !
what is the name of your firm ?
not my firm , that was not my job ...
so the brunette in the drawer , she' s your wife ?
she' s american ?
yep ...
ok , i see ...
what do you mean ?
she made you go to the usa , in fact i don' t know ...
was she in love with you ?
thank you .
sanders ain' t your real name , huh ?
no , i changed it .
when you change your life ... ... if you want to be left alone ... ... you must change your name too .
and you loved her ?
how long did you work for the police ? !
it' s not because of a woman ...
so what happened exactly ?
what happened is ...
i don' t know exactly .
everything was going fine ...
i had a lot of ideas , they paid for them ...
paid a lot ?
i was the one who paid a lot at the end ...
was too much ...
and you suddenly left everything behind ?
yes .
what did you tell them ?
nothing ...
not to anyone ?
no .
are you nuts !
what are you doing ?
it' s for the raft !
i take you to st domingue !
on a raft ? !
i' m not crazy !
this one won' t do .
we' il try to reach the coast , and then we' il ...
what coast ?
the closest is la gueira ... ... and it quite far from here !
we might end sailing !
i' m not joking !
then , you' il just have to take a plane ...
well ...
how about you ?
i gonna buy another boat , or float my boat off ...
so we won' t see each other then ...
no , but we can never know ... fortunately ...
there is fresh coffee in the kitchen .
do you want some ?
you know what we' il do , you' il go at la gueira ... ...
i wait here , you come back with a new boat ... ... and we' il go together at st domingue .

you know , we bought them now ...
yes i know .
coleman told me ...
entrez , miss mark ...
bonjour .
a va ?
trs bien , merci .
d' o vient ce vernis ?
pas de chez nous ...
je i' ai achet bangkok .
and he is still ignorant yet ?
no .
are you sure of that ?
yes !
we even have bought his island without him knowing it ...
whom does he pay his rent to ?
to the former owners ...
miss marks has settled that with them .
she' s terrific !
did you never felt like going and take him back ?
not at all !!!
he might go farer than that !
that would cost us more money !
you' re absolutely sure he' il come back ?
what is he doing ?
selling his fruits and vegetables ...
whom does he sell them to ?
to us ...
i mean , he sells on markets ... ...
and then , once he' s gone , miss mark shows up ...
what' s up ?
don' t you agree ?
no i' m not !
he costs us money ?
he made us earn a hundred time more !
and he will , more and more !
he' s unique !
buying him all the pacific ocean or the atlantic will not make him come back !
then go fetch him with a gun my dear !
i don' t need a gun !
i just have to call our lawyers !
do you what is that ? !
the 27 contracts he signed before making off !
27 trials !
who' s gonna pay ?
you ?
the japanese has built 4 factories to make perfumes which remain in his mind !
who' s gonna pay back ?
you ?
personnaly , i don' t speak japanese ...
because you don' t know exactly how much it costed us so far ...
i' il tell you !!!
