welcome to alcatraz .
inside b and c !

25 on inside c , first tier .
20 inside b , first tier .
23 on inside c , second tier .
17 inside b , second tier .
break out !
inside b and c.

better button your collar , boy .
no forks .
hey , no forks .
do you see any ?
fresh fish , you want your pasta ?
hey , you want your pasta ?
do you see any ?
i see pasta in my sleep .
i' m litmus .
like litmus paper .
when it' s cold , my face gets blue .
when it' s hot , my face gets red .
inside c , move out .
warden wants to see you .
name ?
morris .
that' s funny .
this file says frank lee morris .
if you disobey the rules of society , they send you to prison .
if you disobey the rules of prison , they send you to us .
alcatraz is not like any other prison in the united states .
here , every inmate is confined alone to an individual cell .
unlike my predecessors , wardens johnson and blackwell ,
i don' t have good conduct programs .
i do not have inmate councils .
inmates have no say in what they do .
they do as they' re told .
you are not permitted to have newspapers or magazines carrying news .
knowledge of the outside world is what we tell you .
from this day on , your world will be everything that happens in this building .
you will shave once a day .
you will shower twice a week .
you will cut your hair once a month .
now , your privileges .
you can talk .
you can work .
other institutions hand out work , but here it' s a privilege that you earn .
i promise you it' s a privilege that you' il want .
visitors you' re allowed two a month .
they cannot be former inmates of this or any other federal prison .
all names that you submit will be carefully checked by the fbl .
what names do you have in mind ?
i can' t think of any offhand .
family members ?
none .
no family .
alcatraz is a maximum security prison with very few privileges .
we don' t make good citizens , but we make good prisoners .
burglary , armed robbery , grand larceny ...
you' ve escaped from quite a few prisons , haven' t you ?
that' s why you' re here .
alcatraz was built to keep all the rotten eggs in one basket .
i was specially chosen to ensure that the stink from the basket does not escape .
since i' ve been warden some have tried to escape .
most have been recaptured .
those who haven' t have been killed or drowned in the bay .
no one has ever escaped from alcatraz .
and no one ever will .
you two go everywhere together ?
sure .
even to bed together .
when i wash , he washes .
that way we sleep nice nice together .
capisce ?
i' m wolf .
where did they transfer you from ?
atlanta .
nice town , atlanta .
i never saw it .
i' m looking for a new punk .
good luck .
you don' t understand .
i just found her .
why don' t you show her what you can do ?
morris , i need somebody in the library .
take him over there , will you ?
yes , captain .
move .
what you want , boy ?
the bull sent me down here to work .
can you read , boy ?
as long as it' s in the english language , boy .
you treat them all like wolf ?
wolf wanted to get friendly .
i didn' t .
you' il take that cart to the cells .
don' t they let cons down here ?
you see any chairs ?
how come ?
because this is the rock , man .
they don' t want you doing anything here , but time ...
hard friggin ' time .
rock affects dudes differently .
it either brings out your strength , or it breaks you .
what did it do for you ?
what happens when you get out ?
i won' t .
10 years ago ...
i was in this bar in alabama when two dudes started hassling me .
that was their first mistake .
they pulled knives .
that was their second mistake .
they didn' t know how to use them .
that was the last mistake they ever made .
i got two 99 year sentences back to back .
seems like you could have pleaded self defence .
the dudes were white , man , just like you .
when i arrived they put me in one of those dark cells in d block .
after a while , i went stir crazy .
sliced my achilles ' tendon to get out .
you' il see why when you see d block .
tell me something , you through killing white guys ?
why ?
well , i don' t know .
i just figured i wouldn' t turn my back on you .
hey .
what' s your name , man ?
frank .
what' s yours ?
english .
see you later .
your name ?
morris .
ok .
magazine or book ?
where' s english ?
what did they do , give a nigger a nigger of his own ?
magazine ?
hi !
i' m bugsy .
magazine or book ?
thanks .
hey , you' re new .
yeah .
hey , wait , wait a minute .
i haven' t seen a new guy in six months .
it' s nice to talk .
how are the brooklyn dodgers doing ?
moved to la two years ago .
no kidding ?
warden don' t allow books in these cells .
how come ?
because there' s no light in them .
better deliver them books , morris , where they can be read .
right .
what' s the flower ?
that' s something inside me they can' t lock up with their bars and walls .
i' m doc .
you ever paint ?
no .
why not ?
you scared of dying ?
i don' t think so .
you better be .
you hurt wolf .
wolf' s going to hurt you .
where you going , cracker ?
pete .
something special about those steps ?
the higher you sit , the more status you got .
so we play king of the mountain , except here we don' t play for fun , man .
and you' re king ?
yeah .
now , i figure there' s two reasons why you didn' t sit down on my step .
either you' re too scared , or you just hate niggers .
now , which is it , boy ?
you too scared ?
i just hate niggers .
so no one' s ever busted out .
no one' s ever made it .
everyone has looked for a way , but there ain' t any .
see those hacks ?
most joints have one hack for every seven cons .
there' s one hack for every three cons here .
you start shitting at night instead of in the morning , they want to know why .
let' s say you' re going to try it anyway .
first , you' ve got to get out of the cell .
each bar has six hard smaller bars set in a steel tube with extra steel poured in .
and there ain' t no way to tunnel out , either .
shit .
this island is solid rock .
see that water ?
it' s over a mile swim to land .
the currents make it seem like 10 .
and the water' s so cold it will numb your arms in minutes .
even if you are a good swimmer , you won' t have time to make it .
there are 12 counts every day .
sometimes i think that' s all this shit hole is , one long count .
we count the hours , the bulls count us , and the king bulls count the counts .
inside !
everybody in !
i' m assigning you a permanent job .
the carpentry shop .
it' s a paying job .
how much ?
15 cents an hour .
well , i always knew crime would pay .
it' s a job .
see you later .
i sleep lousy , but i sniff the glue .
it passes the nights .
aren' t you afraid they' il shake down your cell ?
then i go to the hole .
it' s worth the chance .
i guess anything you want bad enough is worth the chance .
including busting out ?
hey , maybe there' s a way out .
it' s on top of your head .
yeah .
the ventilator shafts on top of our block .
how do you get on top of the block ?
ask the bull for the key .
thanks .
hey , jive dude , where you going ?
summer' s coming on .
it' s getting cooler .
weather here is as crazy as the rock .
maybe crazier .
mark twain wrote that the coldest winter he ever spent was a summer in san francisco .
i can ...
wolf' s coming at you .
is his hand cupped ?
yes .
which one ?
his right .
break off !
drop it , wolf !
drop it , wolf .
you like d block , wolf ?
you better , because you' re gonna rot there for a long time .
d block , morris .
look , he came at me .
i said d block .
when i get out , you' re dead .
you' il be dead before you get out .
warden don' t like inmates fighting .
don' t like ' em stinking up their cells , either .
lights out !
go on back to your cell .
welcome to alcatraz .
hey , is anybody over there ?
yeah , me .
come out in front and say hello .
busy .
how busy can you be in one of these closets ?
don' t worry .
i washed it .
how you doing , neighbour ?
i' m charley butts .
smallest cell i ever been in .
you' il get used to it .
i don' t think so .
i don' t like living alone here .
you' il get used to that , too .
break out !
yard time !
button the collar .
who' s the new fish ?
i got him next to me .
what' s your name ?
charley butts .
charley' s butt ?
butts .
butts .
charley butts .
you got a funny name , kid .
yeah ?
what' s your name ?
al capone .
thought you were dead .
me ?
i got too much money .
i' il never die .
you play poker ?
not much .
i just learned myself .
we' il play tomorrow .
see you later , kid .
see you later , al .
i don' t believe i just met al capone .
i don' t , either .
i' m doc .
charley butts .
how' s the painting going , doc ?
the one of the warden ?
it' s nearly finished .
you painting the warden ?
he' s very inspiring .
inside .
everybody in .
yes , sir ?
i want painting privileges taken away from chester dalton .
doc ?
cell 233 .
what' s the reason ?
you' re deputy warden .
you think of one .
when do you want the suspension to begin ?
it' s not a suspension .
it' s an elimination .
right away .
yes , sir .
painting privileges have been removed .
why ?
i don' t know .
painting' s all i have .
i' m sorry , doc .
you ok , doc ?
i think there' s something wrong with him .
i' d keep my eye on doc .
he seems pretty upset .
cons are always upset about something .
put your overalls on .
mr zimmerman , i' m making a new table .
i need a hatchet .
bob , get doc a hatchet .
mr zimmerman !
can you come over here for a minute ?
get him out of here !
get him out !
take him out of here !
get him out !
get back to work .
let' s go !
move !
everybody , back to work !
let' s go !
here .
put that in your report .
what were you doing back there , boy ?
how about a magazine ?
why not ?
what do you want ?
boy' s life ?
i know some queens who fight over it every month .
just give me what you got on top there .
i heard about doc , and i know why he did it .
somebody took away his painting privileges .
who ?
the warden .
morris .
i hear there was an accident in one of the shops .
accident ?
you mean doc .
yeah , someone didn' t like what he was painting , so someone won' t let him paint .
someone should have warned doc to be careful what he paints .
i think you' re absolutely right , sir .
there' s always the possibility that some asshole will be offended , isn' t there ?
we all have to be careful .
back in line .
hey , how' s it going , frank ?
well , well .
if it isn' t the anglins .
what are you guys doing , just dropping by ?
thought we' d pay you a visit .
gonna stay long ?
not long .
only about 15 or 20 years .
why the rock ?
we were leaving atlanta when we encountered a minor problem .
such as ?
they saw us .
yeah , that do present problems .
they shipped us to leavenworth .
but we didn' t like their accommodations , either .
warden said he knew just the place for us ...
alcatraz .
is it true no one' s ever bust out of here ?
so they tell me .
jesus .
wonder what i' d be like after 15 years here .
you still reading that bible ?
yeah .
it' s opening up all kinds of new doors .
i turned 35 today .
some birthday .
when' s your birthday ?
i don' t know .
jeez , what kind of childhood did you have ?
short .
i always wanted to see san francisco .
never thought it' d be like this .
what' d you get sent to the rock for ?
couple of years ago i started stealing cars , for kicks mostly .
i' d sell the parts .
got sent to the state pen .
you end up in alcatraz for that ?
not exactly .
a bull there liked to push me around .
so when i got out , i went back , and stole his car .
unfortunately , i drove it across the state line , which made it a federal rap , and i was sent to the rock .
english !
visitor for you .
butts , you got a visitor .
me ?
yeah , you .
probably somebody wants their car back .
hello , father .
why didn' t you say you were coming ?
i was afraid you wouldn' t let me .
it' s just hard to see you like this .
your mama' s going to die .
charley ?
when ?
well , she' s got a few months .
can you call her ?
we' re not allowed to make phone calls .
you cannot discuss institution rules .
stick to your personal life .
this is my personal life !
you getting a kick out of it ?
hello ?
hello !
i ... love ... you ...
charley .
hey , frank .
yeah ?
if you try to get out , i want in .
must be wednesday .
why ?
mystery mounds .
we always have mystery mounds on wednesday .
i can' t taste it .
i just eat it out of habit .
what' s the movie this weekend ?
some cowboy piece of shit .
hey , at least they could show us a gangster movie .
i may have found a way out of here .
you looking at something ?
this cell block' s really getting old .
the moist air corrodes the concrete .
the salt is rusting the metal .
i took a nail clipper , and dug around the grille at the back of the cell .
i can dig that grille out , and enlarge the hole into the utility corridor to the top of the cell block and maybe onto the roof .
how will we hide the hole ?
we tear the ads from magazines ... no one will miss those ... make cardboard , paint grilles on that , and put it in the hole , maybe partially obscure it with a towel or whatever .
i' ve ordered an accordion to put in front of my hole .
suppose we make it .
they' il know we' re gone at the next count .
we' il leave at night , so they won' t know till the morning .
we' il have to make some dummy heads , make them out of plaster or cardboard or whatever .
put them in the bunks , the guards won' t know .
you work in the barbershop .
you get the hair .
how do we cross the bay ?
that' s your job .
you work in the clothing shop .
you' re gonna steal some raincoats and some contact cement .
we' il make a life raft and some life preservers .
i read how to do it in popular mechanics .
they' il think we' re going to frisco .
well , we won' t .
we' il go to angel island instead .
what about me ?
you' il stand guard while i dig .
i' il stand guard while you dig .
you two trade off the same way .
what are our chances ?
slim .
i' m in .
me , too .
i wanna go .
charley .
yeah ?
i' m gonna start digging .
keep an eye out .
if you see one , start whistling , huh ?
how' s it going ?
fair .
whoever named this place the rock wasn' t kidding .
working with those nail clippers just doesn' t have any grip .
hey , guard .
yeah ?
can i exchange this spoon ?
looks like it' s been in someone' s ass .
and i want to work in the kitchen .
go ahead .
thank you .
i' d like to join the kitchen detail .
can you cook ?
can i swap this spoon for another ?
damn right i can cook .
i used to be a cook in this caf .
everybody loved my meatballs .
did you quit or get fired ?
neither .
i robbed the caf .
heard you had a visitor .
my daughter .
she' s getting married .
he' s white ... just like you .
congratulations .
want a magazine ?
yeah .
what do you recommend ?
ebony .
hey , english .
is it possible to weld two pieces of metal together here in the cell ?
for digging ... or sticking ?
digging .
it ain' t easy , but i could show you .
planning on going somewhere ?
there hasn' t been a day that i' ve been on this rock that i didn' t think of busting out .
if i' d known , i' d have slashed my throat instead of my tendon .
hey , litmus , can you get me a dime ?
no problem .
cost you 10 desserts .
i need it tonight .
no problem .
cost you an extra five .
get me a dime , i' il toss in 10 beetles for your mouse .
thanks .
hey , frank , what' s burning ?
if you see one of those bulls coming , just start whistling .
hey , spoof , what' s for breakfast ?
i smell something burning .
i don' t smell anything .
hell , must be my imagination .
working nights really gets to you after a while .
try it from my side .
keep an eye out .
he may be back .
the grille' s welded on two hook anchors ?
if i get a wedge i may be able to knock those anchors loose .
this might just be what i' m looking for .
but it won' t get through the metal detector .
yeah , i know .
morris , hold it .
i made it for a clothes peg .
why the metal over the edge ?
so the clothes would slide off easy .
i don' t believe you .
i didn' t try to hide it .
why would i try to take metal through a detector ?
because you' re stupid .
move it .
open up 107 .
why did you order this stuff ?
you don' t look like a painter .
you wouldn' t know talent if it looked you in the face .
i' m looking you in the face and i don' t see shit .
hair .
your colour .
frank .
paint .
one of them' s flesh coloured .
what are you painting ?
i don' t know .
the ocean maybe .
if you' re using flesh coloured paint , you better paint a portrait .
yeah .
frank .
frank .
morris go to sleep early tonight ?
yeah .
wasn' t feeling well .
he must sleep pretty soundly .
he hasn' t moved .
morris ?
yeah , what' s up ?
i went up top last night .
i saw the ventilator shaft to the roof , but i can' t reach it .
i need a boost .
how are you all coming ?
my dummy' s ready .
the hole' s done , but i' m just starting the dummy .
i ain' t doing too good .
tonight , john and i will go up .
you get those raincoats , might as well start hauling them up .
i' il wear one back from the shop each day .
there' s a different hack there in the afternoon .
he' il think i wore it to work .
can you get that contact cement ?
i keep inventory .
hey !
give me a boost .
the bars feel pretty solid .
there seems to be a metal hood riveted onto higher uprights .
we' il spread the bars with a pipe and knock the hood off .
there' s an electrical outlet here .
get a motor , a drill bit and a flashlight and we' d have it all .
great .
where' s the nearest hardware store ?
can you get me an extension cord and a drill bit from the shop ?
if they find out , i go to the hole .
all right , but from now on , you put your desserts onto my tray .
time' s up .
back to the cells .
damn it !
just when i thought we was doing good .
i can use this .
are you crazy ?
hold it , morris .
want to look at one of those cases .
try this one .
let' s open it up .
stole this penlight from the doc .
hey .
give me a boost .
pipe .
ok .
hand me the drill .
we' re all through .
fire !
hey , 50 millimetre guns .
i' m worried about the shakedowns .
my cardboard grille keeps slipping out .
put some contact cement around the edges .
that should take care of it .
how' s the raft and the life jackets coming ?
ok .
i think they' il be done tuesday .
tuesday night , we go .
what' s that for ?
just thinking about doc .
yeah .
we planted those chrysanthemums 15 years ago .
they meant a lot to doc .
to me , too .
i had a garden .
what' d you grow , weeds ?
it' s against regulations , morris , and you know it .
stretcher .
get the medic .
he won' t need one .
some men are destined never to leave alcatraz ...
alive .
got those books that may help you .
thanks .
see you later , man .
goodbye ... boy .
so long ... boy .
shakedown .
move .
move , move , move .
take a seat .
been playing this thing long ?
couple of months .
you any good ?
terrible .
you' il get better .
excuse me .
that' s one of the benefits of alcatraz .
lots of time to practise .
has morris been doing anything unusual ?
sometimes he stays up late talking with butts .
split them up .
move morris .
i' il have to get a cell ready and do the paperwork .
do you ?
yes , sir .
we could move him , say , wednesday .
tuesday morning .
yes , sir .
i missed you , morris .
i missed you so much , i got a present for you .
i' il give it to you ... later .
get your ass back there .
he' il kill you , or you' il have to kill him .
well , i' m not going to give him the chance .
can you get the raft and life jackets ready by tonight ?
all right .
we' il meet on top as soon as the lights are out .
wolf , you carrying ?
who , me ?
move out .
where you going , wolfie ?
i' m just going for a walk .
let' s take that walk .
after six months in the hole ,
looks like you could use some exercise .
butts .
i' il meet you up on top .
let' s go .
yeah .
you' re going , too .
butts .
butts , god damn it .
can' t risk tearing this gear , what' s left of it .
throw me the stuff when i get over .
watch the barbed wire .
get up , morris .
it' s moving day .
i said , get up , morris .
open up 109 .
god damn it , morris .
i said get ...
jesus christ .
morning , sergeant .
what have you got ?
photos and a notebook of clarence anglin' s .
funny looking bag .
must have been made from a raincoat .
it appears that they drowned .
why ?
if that was important they wouldn' t have lost it .
maybe they lost it to look like they drowned .
warden , i just got a message from the director .
he wants you in washington .
do chrysanthemums grow on this island ?
not here on angel island .
why ?
i' m curious .
the tides were mild and the fog light last night .
if they left at lights out , they had a 9 1/ 2 hour head start .
i wonder if they made it .
they drowned .
yes , sir .
a massive search was conducted for frank morris , john and clarence anglin .
law enforcement agencies were certain they would find the bodies .
they never did .
alcatraz was closed less than a year later .
