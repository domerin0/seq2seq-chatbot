the city has fallen silent .
there is no warmth left in the sun .
it grows so cold .
it' s just the damp of the first spring rain .
i do not believe this darkness will endure .
look , the orcs ... ... they' re moving off .
you see , mr. frodo ... ... some luck at last .
move it , you slugs !
come on !
faster !
come along , you scum ....
i' il whip you down to the bone , you ....
come on !
what have i told you ? !
get up !
come on , you slugs !
you two are going straight to the front line !
now , move it !
go on !
fall in !
move it !
to the gate , you slugs !
now , move it !
don' t you know we' re at war ?
company , halt !
inspection !
sam , help me .
mr. frodo !
stand up , mr. frodo .
stand up !
it' s so heavy .
oh , no .
what do i do ?
what do we do ?
hit me .
what ?
hit me , sam .
start fighting .
get off of me !
nobody pushes me , you filthy maggot .
get off of me !
break it up !
break it up !
oi !
i' il have your guts if you don' t shut this rabble down !
go , sam .
now !
move along , scum !
back in the line !
you maggots !
get back into the line , you slugs !
dig it , you slugs .
move it .
move it !
i can' t ....
i can' t ....
i can' t manage the ring , sam .
it' s ....
it' s ....
it' s such a weight to carry .
it ....
such a weight .
we' re going that way .
straight as we can .
there' s no point carrying anything we' re not sure to need .
mr. frodo .
look .
there is light ... ... and beauty up there ... ... that no shadow can touch .
take mine .
there' s a few drops left .
there will be none left for the return journey .
i don' t think there will be a return journey , mr. frodo .
frodo , get down !
hide !
frodo !
where are they ?
let the lord of the black land come forth !
let justice be done upon him !
my master , sauron the great , bids thee welcome .
is there any in this rout with authority to treat with me ?
we do not come to treat with sauron ... ... faithless and accursed .
the armies of mordor must disband .
he is to depart these lands , never to return .
old greybeard .
i have a token i was bidden to show thee .
frodo .
frodo .
silence .
no !
silence !
the halfling was dear to thee , i see .
know that he suffered greatly at the hands of his host .
who would' ve thought one so small could endure so much pain ?
and he did , gandalf .
he did .
and who is this ?
isildur' s heir ?
it takes more to make a king than a broken elvish blade .
i guess that concludes negotiations .
i do not believe it .
i will not .
pull back .
pull back !
it' s gone , mr. frodo .
the light' s passed on , away towards the north .
something' s drawn its gaze .
hold your ground !
hold your ground .
sons of gondor , of rohan , my brothers !
i see in your eyes ... ... the same fear that would take the heart of me .
a day may come when the courage of men fails ... ... when we forsake our friends and break all bonds of fellowship .
but it is not this day .
an hour of wolves and shattered shields ... ... when the age of men comes crashing down .
but it is not this day .
this day we fight !
by all that you hold dear on this good earth ... ...
i bid you stand , men of the west !
never thought i' d die fighting side by side with an elf .
what about side by side with a friend ?
aye .
i could do that .
do you remember the shire , mr. frodo ?
it' il be spring soon .
and the orchards will be in blossom .
and the birds will be nesting in the hazel thicket .
and they' il be sowing the summer barley in the lower fields ... ... and eating the first of the strawberries with cream .
do you remember the taste of strawberries ?
no , sam .
i can' t recall the taste of food ... ... nor the sound of water ... ... nor the touch of grass .
i' m ... ... naked in the dark .
there' s there' s nothing .
no veil between me and the wheel of fire .
i can see him ... ... with my waking eyes .
then let us be rid of it ... ... once and for all .
come on , mr. frodo .
i can' t carry it for you ... ... but i can carry you .
come on !
aragorn .
elessar .
for frodo .
look , mr. frodo .
a doorway .
we' re almost there .
clever hobbits to climb so high !
mustn' t go that way .
mustn' t hurt the precious .
you swore !
you swore on the precious !
smagol promised !
smagol lied .
frodo !
eagles .
the eagles are coming !
frodo !
i' m here , sam .
destroy it !
go on !
now !
throw it in the fire !
what are you waiting for ?
just let it go !
the ring is mine .
no .
no .
no !
yes !
yes !
precious !
precious !
precious !
precious !
give me your hand !
take my hand !
no !
don' t you let go .
don' t let go .
reach !
frodo !
frodo !
it' s gone .
it' s done .
yes , mr. frodo .
it' s over now .
i can see the shire .
the brandywine river .
bag end .
gandalf' s fireworks .
the lights in the party tree .
rosie cotton dancing .
she had ribbons in her hair .
if ever i was to marry someone ... ... it would' ve been her .
it would' ve been her .
i' m glad to be with you , samwise gamgee ...
... here at the end of all things .
gandalf ?
frodo !
gimli !
now come the days of the king .
may they be blessed .
this day does not belong to one man ... ... but to all .
let us together rebuild this world ... ... that we may share in the days of peace .
my friends ...
... you bow to no one .
and thus it was .
a fourth age of middle earth began .
and the fellowship of the ring ... ... though eternally bound by friendship and love ... ... was ended .
thirteen months to the day since gandalf sent us on our long journey ... ... we found ourselves looking upon a familiar sight .
we were home .
hi .
hey , watch the pumpkin .
more of the same , rosie .
good night , lads .
how do you pick up the threads of an old life ?
how do you go on ... ... when in your heart you begin to understand ... ... there is no going back ?
there are some things that time cannot mend ... ... some hurts that go too deep ... ... that have taken hold .
there and back again ... a hobbit' s tale , by bilbo baggins
mr. frodo ?
what is it ?
it' s been four years to the day since weathertop , sam .
it' s never really healed .
a hobbit' s tale by bilbo baggins .
and the lord of the rings by frodo baggins .
you finished it .
not quite .
there' s room for a little more .
bilbo once told me his part in this tale would end ... ... that each of us must come and go in the telling .
bilbo' s story was now over .
there would be no more journeys for him ... ... save one .
tell me again , lad , where are we going ?
to the harbour , bilbo .
the elves have accorded you a special honour ... ... a place on the last ship to leave middle earth .
frodo ... ... any chance of seeing that old ring of mine again ?
the one i gave you .
i' m sorry , uncle .
i' m afraid i lost it .
oh .
pity .
i should like to have held it one last time .
well , here' s a sight i have never seen before .
the power of the three rings is ended .
the time has come ... ... for the dominion of men .
the sea calls us home .
i think i' m ... ... quite ready for another adventure .
farewell ... ... my brave hobbits .
my work is now finished .
here at last , on the shores of the sea ... ... comes the end of our fellowship .
i will not say , " do not weep " ... ... for not all tears are an evil .
it is time , frodo .
what does he mean ?
we set out to save the shire , sam .
and it has been saved .
but not for me .
you don' t mean that .
you can' t leave .
the last pages are for you , sam .
you cannot always be torn in two .
you will have to be one and whole for many years .
you have so much to enjoy and to be and to do .
your part in the story will go on .
well ... ...
i' m back .
lay down
your sweet and weary head
night is falling
you have come to journey' s end
sleep now
and dream of the ones who came before
they are calling
from across the distant shore
why do you weep ?
what are these tears upon your face ?
soon you will see
all ofyour fears will pass away
safe in my arms
you' re only sleeping
what can you see
on the horizon ?
why do the white gulls
call ?
across the sea
a pale moon rises
the ships have come
to carry you home
and all will turn
to silver glass
a light on the water
all souls pass
hope fades
into the world of night
through shadows falling
out of memory and time
don' t say
we have come now to the end
white shores are calling
you and i will meet again
and you' il be here in my arms
just sleeping
what can you see
on the horizon ?
why do the white gulls
call ?
across the sea
a pale moon rises
the ships have come
to carry you home
and all will turn
to silver glass
a light on the water
grey ships pass
into the west
