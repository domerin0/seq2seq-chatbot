god said to noah , " i am going to put an end to all people
for the earth is filled with violence because of them .
you are to bring into the ark two of all living creatures to keep them alive with you .
in other words , life is hard , so you better find someone who will be your partner .
eliot arnold' s story is a lot like noah' s , except eliot' s story takes place in miami .
you just can' t beat these when they' re really fresh .
anyway , eliot should probably tell you exactly what happened , because i was locked in the trunk of a police car for part of it . my name' s puggy , and i live in a tree .
i hope i didn' t ruin anything for you .
man ; i look at this ad , and it doesn' t say " fish hook ale " to me .
this sucks .
bruce , what i' m trying to do
do you know what my business philosophy is ?
no , bruce , what is it ? my business philosophy is that there a lot of people in the world .
that certainly isn' t
and all these people want something .
do you know what they want ?
well , i
they want to feel good .
you know what i mean ?
yeah , well , i
no , you don' t know what i mean , because i gave you the perfect concept , which is not this piece of shit here ! .
what the hell is this ? !
why are you saying " ugly " ? !
i don' t want to see ugly ! .
that' s not the feeling i want !
bruce , w what i' m doing here is is contrast in a humorous fashion .
get hooked on fish hook " that' s the concept !
you got a guy and a boat and a girl .
the girl' s in a bikini .
she has big tits .
they' re on a boat , getting shitfaced , drinking fish hook ale .
the girl has really big tits !
the feeling of this ad is somebody' s going to get laid .
it' s perfect .
i gave you the perfect concept .
and you give me ugly ? !
all right , all right , bruce , i' il try
no , no .
don' t tell me " try . " i hate the word " try .
try " is for losers .
listen to me , you are not the only ad agency in this town !
a year ago , i had a nice house , a beautiful wife , and a job i really loved .
now i was being called a loser by this guy .
for 18 years , i wrote a column for the miami herald funny stories the higher ups referred to as " offbeat .
deeber wants to see you .
because i' d won two pulitzer prizes for my offbeat stories ,
i was pretty much left alone and treated with a great deal of respect ... until ken deeber came .
eliot ...
john croton tells me you still haven' t turned anything in on the day care crisis .
yeah , ken , listen , i figure with five people already working on the day care crisis story , our readers pretty much know there' s a crisis in day care .
eliot , you were given an assignment .
i know that .
the pelican story ?
right .
no one else has it .
this old cuban guy is training pelicans
to drop bombs the most asinine thing i ever heard .
come on .
he tried to kill castro with a bird !
eliot , i gave you an assignment , and you will do it .
or what , ken ?
well , if you want to continue working at this newspaper , you will put something in here before you go home .
why don' t i put something in there right now ?
deeber picked the wrong day to be a jerk .
earlier that day , i had found out my wife was having an affair with her tennis instructor .
in retrospect ,
i should have written the day care crisis piece and never opened eliot arnold advertising .
and if you think i' m gonna pay for this stupid shit , you can forget it !
i' m not paying for ugly !
i can get ugly for free !
it goes without saying , bruce .
eliot .
dad , i need to borrow the geo tonight .
hello , nigel .
how' s london ?
nigel ?
foggy .
ah , could you hold on , nigel , just for a moment ?
this is a really important call long distance .
listen , i want to see it tomorrow , and it better be right !
all right , bruce .
i think we got it , uh , well on its way !
good !
hey , matt , how you doing ?
dad , can w we borrow the stupid geo tonight or not ?
because me and andrew have to kill a girl .
andrew and i have to kill a girl .
thank you .
yes , you can borrow the geo tonight , but i need it back at my apartment at , uh , 1 0 : 30 , okay ?
okay .
and i want you to promise me that you' il drive ... carefully .
eliot : matt wasn' t mad at me because of the divorce .
he was mad because i bought a geo .
sweet little vehicle .
just get divorced ?
ah , it doesn' t matter .
42 miles to the gallon , am/ fm radio .
i' il even throw in the undercoating .
anything else you' d like to know ?
yeah .
how many clowns can it hold ?
to matt , the geo was a 48 mile per gallon symbol of my bad luck , wrong choices , and missed opportunities .
little did i know that my shot at a second chance had just arrived in miami onboard flight 57 from new orleans .
the suitcase was sandwiched between a quarter ton of frozen crawfish and a dalmatian that gave birth to a litter of 1 7 over lake okeechobee .
the dalmatian made the evening news .
the suitcase didn' t .
what is it ?
it looks like a garbage disposal .
so this is miami , huh ?
they can keep it .
you got that right .
that' s a remington 30 aught 6 hunting rifle with a bushnell scope .
charlton heston takes his to shoot bighorn elk .
henry desalvo and leonard ferroni take theirs to shoot anyone , as long as they' re paid 25 grand apiece .
we play with a guy that cheats .
actually , henry and leonard didn' t play golf at all .
will you come on ?
we' ve got an early tee time .
they were in miami to kill a man named arthur herk , who had stolen money from his employer .
puggy arrived in miami the same day as the hit men and the suitcase , but for a much different reason .
a week earlier , at his place in boston ,
puggy read an article in martha stewart' s living that said miami had some of the finest cuban restaurants in the entire world .
since fritos were his favorite food and corn chips as close to cuban cuisine as puggy had ever eaten , he decided to hop a fishing boat and check it out .
puggy could not have been happier .
after only 20 minutes in miami , puggy was already thinking that this had to be the warmest , friendliest place on earth .
you stink .
beer and a bag of fritos .
she ran track for 10 years .
she definitely has the legs ...
out .
i tell you once before , you two , out !
look , man , we got money , and we' il take however this much here will get us .
ass wipe .
snake dupree and eddie leadbetter had met two years earlier at the state prison just outside louisville .
they hit it off immediately , having similar tastes in humor .
ass wipe .
you know ,
i don' t know how long she' s been into strength conditioning .
but she' s been into conditioning for a long time because she ran track for 10 .
listen to the crowd .
they are so into it .
hey .
is there a problem , chief ?
give me that back .
look , man , this ain' t your problem .
you are problem .
out .
he broke my ankle .
i break your head .
i' m going .
next time i see you again ... you' re dead .
out !
out .
you can stay .
they took all my money .
it' s okay .
free beer .
aluminum , huh ?
we sponsor girls ' softball team .
you want to make $5 ?
that too .
is not for us .
package deal suitcase or nothing .
lay it down gentle so as not to fall .
strong .
come back tomorrow 1 : 00 . maybe i have more job for you .
after only one day in miami ,
puggy had a more satisfying career and lived in a better neighborhood than i did .
sound system sucks .
why' d your dad buy a geo ?
he thinks he' s a loser , so he bought a loser car .
besides , he' s a dork .
super soaker 600 holds a gallon of water , accurate up to 50 feet .
so , what' s the plan through the front ?
yeah .
it' s matt arnold .
i' m here to kill your daughter , jenny .
no , we gotta go over the wall , dickweed .
i just hope she doesn' t see this stupid turdmobile .
martha stewart ; spread it out on your bed ...
where' s arthur ?
i haven' t seen him since his third scotch . ...
these corners are in the inside corners .
and there .
a rather clumsy task is accomplished in no time .
it' s a good thing .
t alk to me , martha .
good night , nina .
i was wondering if you' d like a drink .
something with tequila ?
arthur herk one of the few floridians who was not confused when he voted for pat buchanan .
no , thank you , mr .
herk .
i' m very tired tonight .
of course you are , because you work so hard , you' re on your feet all day .
a woman' s feet are very important .
let' s have a foot massage .
but , mr .
herk , mrs .
anna
oh , it' s okay .
she' s watching television .
and i' m not gonna tell her that i was here , and you' re not going to tell her either , are you , nina ?
your strong , sturdy ankles , your proud peasant arches .
nina ...
iet me clean your toes with my tongue .
nina !
nina !
nina !
nina !
nina ...
come out of there .
this is my house .
you work for me , and i want to suck your toes .
hope they don' t have a dog .
as it happens , the herks did have a dog .
his name was roger , and he was the random result of generations of hasty , unplanned dog sex .
for the past three months , roger had eaten nothing but dirt .
that was when the most evil being in the universe entered his life .
under the influence of the toad' s hallucinogenic chemicals ,
roger thought his furry butt was a 24 ounce porterhouse . ... nice cut of meat .
and notice how it is nice and thick all along up till about here , and then it kind of tapers off .
she looks like she has nice feet .
what are you watching her cook for , anyway ?
all you know how to make are reservations .
good one , arthur .
what ?
leave her alone .
whoa ho !
i' m gonna see what else is on .
they have a dog .
hope they don' t have a dog .
they have a dog .
come on .
get outta here , you mangy ...
that' s our guy .
kill him now , we make the 1 1; 40 back to newark .
i can' t .
he' s too close to the women .
yeah , you don' t shoot him soon ,
i' m dead from these mosquitoes .
look at this thing .
he' s the size of a buick .
she .
she what ?
the mosquito is a she .
how the hell can you tell that ?
discovery channel .
only the female mosquito sucks your blood .
sounds like my ex wife .
bitch .
i' m going to my room where it' s not so
i don' t know stupid .
good night , mom .
aw , good night , honey .
i think i' il let roger in and go to bed , too .

not a problem .
good night .
hey , jenny !

arthur herk .
i know the mayor .
what took you people so goddamn long ?
we came as soon as we got the call , sir . my tv .

it was a squirt gun , sir .

squirt squirt gun .
it' s a good thing you ran away , arthur .
you might have gotten wet .
shut up !
monica ; easy .

and these are my handcuffs , and if you don' t take it easy , you' il be wearing my handcuffs in your goddamn house .
that' s right , sir .
okay .
one at a time , starting with mr .
killer over here .
what happened ? me and andrew were outside .
" andrew and l .
thank you .
who' s andrew ?
nobody .
andrew' s nobody .
so you were outside with a squirt gun and an imaginary friend ?
yeah .

so you and your imaginary friend are outside .
then what happens ?
officer kramitz , would you please go see who that is ?
you' il be okay ?
coming !
uh , jenny' s mom opened the door , and i came running up to squirt her .
and then , uh , mrs .
herk jumped me or jumped on me .
and , uh , and then i went down on jenny or i f fell on jenny .
this guy says that his son is here .
i' m eliot arnold .
i got a call from andrew .
you all right , matt ?
yeah .
andrew the imaginary friend ?
arthur ; yeah , well , you better have a good lawyer , because your dumb ass son broke my tv .
that' s an rca 39 inch horizontal !
35 inch diagonal .
could somebody just tell me what happened ?
i was trying to sh squirt jenny , and her mom jumped me .
jesus , matt .
look , i' m sorry that my kid squirted your daughter .
i i mean , i' m that he that he got her wet .
i mean , the way he described it ,
i thought it was just a game .
hey , kids you know .
yeah ?
well , your jerk off kid is going to jail .
monica , take a look at this .
who shot the tv ?
shot it ?
nobody shot it .
well , this is a bullet .
monica ; wait a minute . matt , when you and your imaginary friend were outside ,
did you see anyone else ?
no . mrs .
herk , do you live here with anyone besides your husband and your daughter ?
well , there' s ...
where' s nina ?

puggy .
anna ; nina ? !

it' s cool , man .
hello ? !
yeah , i' m here .
we want this job finished as soon as possible .
you got that right .
i' il tell you who did it .
it' s probably some goddamn kids .
' cause these goddamn kids today they all got goddamn guns , and they' re all sniffing glue !
any additional insights , mr .
herk ?
any information can help us to protect you .
i seriously doubt that you or any other member of the police force in this town could protect their own dicks with both hands .
thank you for that observation .
i' m not gonna arrest you , matt , unless mrs .
herk wants to press charges .
hey kids .
i want to press charges !
cuff him ! my hands are kind of full right now , what with holding my dick and all .
this " killer " thing' s really stupid , matt .
yes , ma' am .
good now you and your shithead kid can get the hell out of here and never come back .
thanks for everything .
i' il walk you out .
go get the geo , will you , matt ?
you have a geo ?
a metro , the ldl coupe , or the hatchback ? my biological father sells them in tulsa .
if the salesman tried to pitch you on free undercoating , it' s total bullshit .
they fall apart before they rust .
60 % of the parts are made from recycled plastic soda bottles .
it' s true .
listen , i' m sorry my husband' s such an idiot .
he' s probably really upset because someone shot his tv .
no , he' s an idiot .
do you think someone' s trying to kill him ?
god , i hope so .
what does a guy like arthur do for a living ?
he' s an executive at penultra corporation .
i did an article on them once .
they built the jail downtown where the plumbing doesn' t work .
i called it " crapital punishment .
eliot arnold from the herald ?
i used to read your column .
you were so funny .
what happened ?
i lost my sense of humor in the divorce .
how does a guy like arthur end up with someone like you ?
i married him when jenny was little . my first husband left us kind of early , and we had to move to this crappy little apartment .
and i met arthur .
he was different then .
i keep looking up divorce lawyers in the phone book , but then i think about that horrible apartment .
it' s unavailable .
i live there .
can i borrow this ?
i' m totally into the seminal fluids .
arthur threw mine out at the carwash .
he doesn' t think it' s music unless somebody' s playing an accordion .
i' il drive .
i say we blame the whole evening on rap music and too much violence on television .
you could yell at me if it' d make you feel more dad like .
i don' t want to yell at you .
why don' t we talk ?
you and i let' s just talk .
come on .
okay . mom wanted me to remind you that the alimony check is due monday .
see ?
that wasn' t so hard .
look , matt
dad , i messed up tonight .
everybody messes up .
you know that better than anybody .
so all i' m saying is
i don' t think i need any fatherly advice from you about how to live my life when you' re not doing such a hot job living yours .
hey , we' re talking .
okay .
now it' s my turn .
up yours , you little shithead .
your turn .
puggy .
puggy .
i bring you some lunch .
listen ... i love you .
you see ?
you see the difference ?
you ask a guy what he wants tits or an ugly fish see what he tells you .
probably ...
tits !
i gotta boogie .
hey , she should be leaning over for maximum exposure . maximum exposure ...
anna ; maximum exposure ?
that' s advertising terminology .
oh , i see .
t o what do i owe this pleasure ?
uh , did you happen to lose a pair of reading glasses last night ?
i don' t wear glasses .
oh , well , then , i guess i made the trip for nothing .
nonsense .
i' il need them one day not right this minute .
well , things change .
i' il need them .
um , hey , could i offer you some coffee ?
that would be wonderful .
it' s more of a dare than an offer , actually .
did the police find anything ?
well , after meeting arthur , they figure i' m the primary suspect .
so ...
how do you , uh ...
iike it ?
oh , light and ... sweet .
i forgot my jacket .
got room for a third ?
no harm in asking .
i hope i didn' t hurt you .
no , no , that' s
didn' t know i was , um well , we should go .
let' s let' s , uh ...
yeah .
it' s probably a good idea .
you should go .
later that day ,
arthur herk stopped by to have a friendly chat with his boss .
morning , douche bag .
arthur ?
jesus .
what happened to your hair ?
it' s a wig , you moron .
don' t act stupid .
i know you know what' s going on .
those dickwads upstairs are trying to have me whacked !
hey , hey , first of all , those decisions are made way over my head .
and secondly , you stole money from them , arthur !
what do you expect them to do ? !
look , bitch , you take that express elevator upstairs to the top floor , and you tell those sugar cane sucking scumbags to lay off , or i' m gonna blow the lid on this whole operation !
you' re putting me in a very awkward position .
no , no , no .
no , no , no .
no .
no .
an awkward position is what you' re going to be in when the fbl is shining a proctoscope up your big , fat ass !
i have evidence , and i' il use it !
he didn' t have evidence , but he knew where he could get some .
and that made arthur herk a very dangerous man .
arthur may not have been a genius , but he did know that the bullet that went through xena' s head was meant for his .
penultra construction had arranged for the hit when they discovered
arthur had been skimming money from the company .
up until yesterday , arthur herk had been their bagman .
gentlemen ... we have a problem .
can i get personal ?
oh , now you' re asking ?
your daughter really likes you .
yeah .
we have a pretty good relationship .
the divorce , arthur she doesn' t throw any of that in your face ?
oh , i told jenny a long time ago that i wasn' t perfect .
she tried to accept my mistakes , and i try to accept hers .
sounds simple .
well , i mean , it wasn' t that simple when she came home with a scorpion tattooed on her butt . matt hates me .
he basically thinks i' m a loser .
he called me a loser , so i called him a shithead .
if we had bad teeth , we could go on " jerry springer .
so , what you' re telling me is that her mom beat you up ?
well , she' s in pretty good shape , man .
i mean , she could snap you like a toothpick .
hey .
hi .
you don' t stare at my boobs .
so , did they give you points for the kill ?
no , they said it didn' t count .
well , i know this won' t end till it ends , so i' d like to get this over with .
you can squirt me tonight over at bayside .
i' il be outside the gap at around 8 : 00 , okay ?
okay .
and you don' t look at my ass when i walk away .
i can' t make that promise .
you can squirt me tonight down at bayside .
you' re gonna remember that line when you' re an old dude , dude .
you looking at her ass ?
yeah .
there' s some things i' d like to know .
for instance , who' s the guy running around with the rifle ?
and who in the hell is the guy jumping on me from out of a tree ?
what guy in a tree ?
that' s what i' m wondering .
look , you brought us down here to do a simple job in , out , bing , bang .
all of a sudden , i got geronimo running into the house and tarzan landing on my coconut .
your primary concern is to finish this job before a certain party shoots his mouth off .
excuse me .
nice .
gentlemen , would you mind putting out your cigars , please ?
come again ?
i asked ...
would you mind putting out your cigars , please ?
as a matter of fact , i would mind .
well , you see , the reason i ask all due respect
i got a great new york strip sitting over there , cost me $27 and change , and it tastes like i' m eating a cigar .
listen , ace , number one , you' re eating a steak at a place called joe' s stone crab .
and number two , there' s no rule that says we can' t smoke .
well , number one , my name is not ace .
and number two , i' m not talking about rules here .
i' m talking about manners .
you see , there is no rule that says i can' t come over here and fart on your entree , but i don' t do it .
why ?
because it' s not good manners .
so i ask you again in the nicest possible way to please put out the cigars , okay ?
thank you .
i hope you realize you' ve just committed assault .
i know , i know you know , i remember a time was you actually had to hit somebody .
you go tell your employer it' s gonna cost him another 10 g' s apiece .
okay .
but we want this finished as soon as possible .
well , believe me , we don' t want to spend any more time in this garden spot than we have to .
got that right .
whoa .
look at those wheels .
douche bag' s probably some kind of drug kingpin .
bet he' s got a helicopter and a big ass boat and a pad down in the bahamas like a tax shelter .
stayed in one of them shelters once .
didn' t like it much .
i' m tired of living foot to mouth .
let' s go to the jackal .
there' s something i want to do .
i don' t want to mess with that bartender and his baseball bat .
man on television : ... in the lightweight division .
heather is from woodland hills , california .
she' s got very good balance .
she' s got good muscularity .
she' s going through a routine right now .
hello , mr. herk .
something to drink ?
i need a missile .
this for you ?
this is personal missile ?
what the flying shit do you care ?
usually you drop money , somebody else pick up equipment .
what , are you keeping a diary ?
you got a goddamn missile or not ?
right now , do not have missile . missile wery hard to get .
well , i want you to try wery goddamn hard to get a missile .

take a look .
okay .
i' m not long for this place . my brother' s working security at the airport .
big time .
oh , yeah .
check this out .
well , we' re not supposed to carry guns .
well , we' re not supposed to drink on the job either .
all right .
let' s reconnoiter back here at 2100 hours .
10 : 00 .
just one brave gator fan to call .
where are the gator fans now ?
all you gator fans call when you win .
but now that you lose , you don' t have the guts to call in .
i' m waiting for one , just one ...
what the hell are gators ?
i' m a gator fan , and i' m calling .
and what do you have to say ?
well , you said we don' t have the guts to call , and i' m calling .
that' s it ?
you' re calling to say you' re calling ?
this town gives me a headache .
why do you think he' d come here , a guy like that ?
good job , nice house , plenty of cheese .
what what' s he doing in a shithole like this ? maybe it' s happy hour .
i might as well have a bucket over my head .
keep walking .
don' t do nothing stupid in there .
as far as i' m concerned , this whole idea is stupid .
i think we got gator fans .
is that a squirt gun in your pocket , or were you happy to see me ?
so , where are we gonna do this ?
we don' t want to make a scene , like last time .
well , there' s a parking lot behind the drugstore .
sounds like a good place to die . maybe you could buy me some lip gloss afterwards .
are you staring at her ass ?
you' re not ?
whip out your pistol , cowboy .
where do you want me to shoot you ?
why don' t you shoot her in the crotch ?
you could be like a couple .
this is a friend of yours ?
how about i just shoot you on your hand ? my first hand job .
freeze !
move , move , move !
who' s shooting ?
andrew , come on !
come on , andrew !
holy shit .
oh , shit .
at that very moment , officers romero and kramitz were headed westbound on biscayne boulevard .
three months earlier , they had been involved in a scuffle with a crack dealer at the very intersection they were now passing through .
romero' s shirt had been torn open in the altercation , revealing a red bustier from the victoria' s secret' s " desire " collection .
kramitz had never gotten it out of his mind .
so , i was thinking maybe you and me could get together sometime .
walter , do you want to have sex with me ?
walter couldn' t believe it .
had he somehow found the wormhole in the universe that guys have been seeking for eons the wormhole that would allow him to bypass all the talking and talking and talking and just do it ?
walter thought hard about how he would phrase his response to monica' s question .
yeah .
well , i don' t want to have sex with you .
you' re a married man .
yeah , but not happily .
man with a gun .
police !
put the gun down right now !
it' s not my gun .
some guy
put down the gun !
i' m a very good student .
shut up , punk .
officer kramitz , he looks about as menacing as a backstreet boy .
can i talk to him for a second ?
what' s your name ?
andrew ryan .
andrew ryan , what are you doing with a gun ?
some weird guy was shooting at us .
he dropped it , and i picked it up and ran .
who' s " us " ? my friends matt and jenny .
police !
police !
that' s correct .
we are the police .
jack pendick , big sky security .

bad location .
yes , it is .
i' d like to take a look around the back room right there , the one with all the locks .
you have warrant ?
ain' t that heartwarming ?
you know , the way a man can come here from another country , and in just a short time here in america , he has embraced our way of living to the point where he wants to know if we got a warrant .
don' t that just warm the cockles of your heart , agent seitz ?
it warms the shit out of my cockles .
my cockles are burning .
we don' t need a warrant .
you see , we' re operating under
what' s that thing called we' re operating under again , agent seitz ?
special executive order 768 04 .
that' s it special executive order 768 04 , which basically means that , if it' s a matter of national security , we can send a search party and a doberman pinscher up your ass .
i want lawyer .
did you hear that , agent seitz ?
he want lawyer .
as is his right under our constitution , which we hold sacred .
want me to shoot him in the forehead ?

there' s a guy there in the kitchen .
a guy ?

it could go either way with this crew .
holy shit !

you tell us where it is , we go easy on you .
i i bet that' s what you' re thinking .
isn' t it , ivan ?
don' t be a baby , lvan .
it' s just your foot .
it' s what we at the bureau call an extremity shot .
generally , the victim survives .
they don' t do so good with what we call a torso shot .

bufotenine hell of an hallucinogen .
he' s gone .
he won' t be coming back any time soon .
discovery channel .
oh , please , don' t hurt me !
listen , we have reason to believe that mr .
herk had a suitcase , possibly made of metal , very heavy .
have you seen it ?
yeah , they had it .
who' s " they " ?
an idiot named snake .
him and a possibly even bigger idiot took the suitcase , two hostages , and what sounded like my squad car , so
where did they go ?
you wanna know ?
take me with you .
we don' t have time for games .
this is a very important federal matter .
hey , if you don' t uncuff me , you can stick your very important federal matter right up your big federal ass .
turn right !
can' t you see the sign ?
you sure they said the airport ?
absolutely .
they kept talking about the bahamas .
did anybody open that suitcase ?
not that i saw .
what' s in it ?
the guy we left back there , the frog kisser
uh , actually , it' s a toad .
anyway , the toad lover' s an illegal weapons trader .
weapons ?
that' s what' s in the suitcase ?
you mean guns ?
well , how bad can it be , right ?
it' s a suitcase .
we' re not talking about a nuclear bomb , right ?
right ?
okay , we gotta pick a road .
arrivals or departures ?
we' re arriving , but ... then we' re departing .
which one , snake ?
what do you think ?
i think you guys should turn yourselves in and plead not guilty by reason of stupidity .
departures .
it' il be okay .
dad !
was that a goat ?
dad !
where did they get that stuff ?
russia .
don' t the russians have controls on that kind of thing ?
you' d faint if you knew .
a few months ago , somebody got a warhead out of a missile dismantlement facility in a place called
sergijev posad not far from moscow .
beautiful churches there .
travel channel .
anyway , somebody who knew what they were doing modified it .
dumped it on some guys who run a place here called the jolly jackal .
the bar ?
that bar has more ak 47s than budweiser .
so can they set it off ?
best we know , flip three switches , and you got 45 minutes to clear out .
45 minutes . man , i guess it was bound to happen one day .
what makes you think this is the first time ?
never mind which time this is .
the important thing is we got those assholes trapped at the airport , and until we say further , no plane is taking off .
you can do that ?
okay , let' s go .
i' m gonna have this pointed right at you , so don' t do something stupid .
how would you even know if i did something stupid ?
i' il know .
believe me , i can tell the difference .
eddie , open the trunk .
if you don' t do like i say , you know what' s gonna happen to you , right ?
you' re gonna shoot me ?
you got that right .
okay , let' s go .
bring the suitcase .
i hope you' re not gonna give me a ticket for this .
if i don' t see them , i don' t write them .
everything is very , very wrong .
don' t worry .
they' il never make it through airport security .
we' re gonna miss our flight .
you see what the problem is ?
i don' t know .
there' s some kind of commotion up there .
there might be something about it on the radio .
not now , not tonight , but when they play a game and lose ,
well , you' re not hearing what i' m saying .
i' m saying that i am a gator fan , and i' m calling you now , okay ?
so i don' t understand what the problem is ,
or are you just not ...

anybody in this crackerjack system of yours see anything like that ?
let me just check on that .
man on p. a. ; would the owner of a yellow humvee parked on the curbside ...
hello , alice
what ?
5 minutes ago , the tower got a message from a fly by air pilot saying he' s got a guy with a gun on his plane .
what gate ?
gate j 4 .
i thought you said all the planes were grounded .
give me the wing commander at homestead .
tell him we have a situation .
the plane' s in the air .
all right .
now we' re getting somewhere .
peanuts ?
yes , i need all lines to stay open between myself and homestead . mrs .
herk ! my daughter' s on the plane with that man , and he tried to shoot at us , and you have mrs .
herk , ma' am , listen , we need to know where that metal suitcase is right now .
i don' t know .
i don' t know about a suitcase .
it' s on the plane .
did anybody open that suitcase ?
they made us turn it on .
what happened when you turned it on ?
lights , little numbers .
what' s that thing doing ?
it means the rear door' s open .
i can' t fly the plane much longer with those stairs down .
eddie , pull up those stairs and close the door .
eddie
eddie , stop screwing around .
okay , confirm they got him on radar .
what does he mean they have them on radar ?
give me a second .
you' re gonna shoot that plane down .
you can' t do this .
there' s innocent people on that plane .
if that nuke goes off over freeport , many innocent people die .
now , nobody likes this , okay ?
but this has been discussed , believe me , as high as it can be , every scenario .
and this is the only way out .
how soon ?
when the plane is over the gulf stream three minutes .
what about the kid' s father ? maybe he made it onto the plane .
let' s say he did .
is he , by any chance , familiar with a russian nuclear warhead with a plutonium rod encased in a terillium core ?
i believe he' s in advertising .
eddie .
eddie .
get up .
get up , you lazy shit .
he' s not lazy .
he' s unconscious .
miami tower , this is , uh ...
fly by air 2036 .

you understand me ?

it' s a bomb !
get it off the plane !

it' s gone !
the suitcase is gone !
falcon one , falcon one , break off .
i repeat , break off .
do you read ?
jenny ; mom , mom , listen to this !
it' s totally incredible !
it' s the most amazing story .
oh !
you should' ve seen matt' s dad .
seriously intense .
he smashed that really dumb guy on the head with the fire extinguisher , which was very cool .
and then that guy , snake , he had a gun , and he shot at matt' s dad .
then matt' s dad started beating the crap out of him .
then matt' s dad said , like he was some sort of action hero ,
he' s not lazy .
he' s unconscious ...
i had to outrun a plane and subdue two convicts with a nuclear weapon to get matt' s respect ...
good job , dad . ... but it was worth it .
seitz ; mr. arnold ?
agent alan seitz , fbl .
the president thanks you for your selfless act of courage .
because he can never admit to knowledge of what happened here , in lieu of a medal of honor , he' d like to send you a pair of cowboy boots with a " w " on them and a hat .
sorry for any trouble , folks .
eddie leadbetter served his sentence at a correctional facility just outside jacksonville , and became very good friends with his cellmate , dwight , who shared similar tastes in humor .

henry and leonard still refer to the arthur herk job as the low point of their professional careers .
woman on p. a. ; your attention please .
captain lynch has informed us that there will be a delay due to an obstruction on the runway .
i really feel like killing somebody .
you got that right .
we all go along day after day , when suddenly a bomb drops into our lives .
sometimes you can' t get out of the way .
sometimes it' s a new beginning .
let' s take it slow .
absolutely .
we were married a week after anna' s divorce .
what is it that brings two strangers together so that one soul inhabits two bodies ?
sometimes it' s profound .
sometimes it' s fritos .
god in heaven , make her stop !
she wants my soul !
arugula !
arugula !
arrrrrugula !
