the future has not been written .
there is no fate but what we make for ourselves .
i wish i could believe that .
my name is john connor .
they tried to murder me before i was born .
when i was 13 , they tried again .
machines from the future .
terminators .
all my life , my mother told me the storm was coming .
judgment day .
connor !
the beginning of a war between man and machines .
three billion lives would vanish in an instant .
and i would lead what was left of the human race to ultimate victory .
it hasn' t happened .
no bombs fell .
computers didn' t take control .
we stopped judgment day .
i should feel safe ... ... but i don' t .
so i live off the grid .
no phone , no address .
no one and nothing can find me .
i' ve erased all connections to the past .
but as hard as i try ... ... i can' t erase my dreams ... ... my nightmares .
i feel the weight of the future bearing down on me .
a future i don' t want .
so i keep running ... ... as fast as i can .
anywhere .
nowhere .
oh , my god .
are you okay ?
do you want me to call 911 ?
i like this car .
what are you ... ?
you , in the silver lexus .
slow down .
slow down and pull over immediately .
lady , have you any idea how fast you were going ?
let me see your license and registration .
i like your gun .
what ?
this stupid thing' s not working .
what' s wrong with this thing ?
i hate machines .
hello ?
kate , it' s your father .
you' re blowing me off again .
i' m so sorry .
you know how much i wanted to see you this weekend .
but we' re having computer problems ...
i know , you can' t talk about it .
it' s just ... ... scott was really looking forward to this .
katie .
i wish i had more time to get to know him .
i really do .
that' s okay .
you' re bound to run into him at the wedding .
please .
i' m still in a state of denial about that .
you' re not the only one .
hey , kiddo .
you don' t need me to pass judgment on this guy .
you' ve done the right thing your whole life .
you won' t make a mistake .
you never do .
i' m the luckiest father in the world , you know ?
i' ve never had to be afraid for my daughter .
listen , i hate this .
i gotta run .
come see me .
i promise i won' t cancel .
we will .
bye , dad , i love you .
love you too .
okay , what have we got ?
this new computer virus is tricky .
it' s infected half the civilian internet as well as secondary military apps .
payroll , inventory .
primary defense nets are still clean ?
so far the firewalls are holding up .
sir , the pentagon has proposed we use our al to scan the infrastructure .
search and destroy for any hint of the virus .
i know , tony , but that' s like going after a fly with a bazooka .
once the connection' s made , it should only be a few minutes .
during which we' ve put everything under the control of a single computer system .
the most intelligent system ever conceived .
i still prefer to keep humans in the loop .
i' m not sure skynet' s ready .
yes , sir .
thanks .
you' re supposed to go around to the back .
hey , i said you' re supposed to go ...
take off your clothes .
patience , honey .
bitch .
wait your turn .
your clothes .
talk to the hand .
now .
welcome to jim' s burgers .
can i take your order ?
jose barrera ?
yeah , that' s me .
growing concern over widespread outages in the global digital network ... ... have prompted rumors of a new computer super virus .
wall street analysts are confident ...
shit !
my mom' s home .
here .
hide the beer .
hide the beer .
here .
take that .
go , go , go .
elizabeth and william anderson ?
i' m bill .

i have to go to the clinic .
it' s an emergency .

cool it , guys , it' s just me .
we' ve got a sick cat coming in .

junkies .

i suppose it was you who ripped us off last week .
put the phone down .
sorry .
i just ...
i needed some medicine .
there' s an emergency clinic half a mile away .

how much did you take ?
enough .
well ... ... this is the stuff we use to chemically neuter dogs .

you didn' t have to do that !
next time bring a clue , not a paintball gun .
no , this isn' t what you think .
yeah , right .
it' s hercules .
i think he' s got pneumonia .
he started coughing and wouldn' t stop .
betsy , i' ve got a problem in the back .
a problem ?
this is an emergency !
it sounds like a hairball .
i know what a hairball sounds like .
where' s dr. monroe ?
it' s 5 : 30 in the morning .
i' m sure he' s home sleeping .
he' il come in if he has to .
just wait in here with hercules and i' il be a few minutes , all right ?

no .
you must live .

i' m being kidnapped .
where are you now ?
i don' t know where .
i' m in my truck .
it' s a toyota tundra .
it says " emery animal hospital " on the side .
i' m locked inside the back .
hello ?
hello ?
shit !

what are you doing here ?
you tell me .
you got me into this .

hold on !

i' il drive .
get out .
excuse me .

no sign of brain trauma .
yeah , i' m fine , thanks .
do you even remember me ?
sarah connor ?
blowing up cyberdyne ?
hasta la vista , baby .
ring any bells ?
that was a different t 101 .
what , do you come off an assembly line or something ?
exactly .
oh , man .
i' m gonna have to teach you everything all over again .
katherine brewster , have you sustained injury ?
drop dead , you asshole !
i' m unable to comply .
where are you taking me ?
to a safe location .
all right , get off at the next exit .
let her out .
negative .
katherine brewster must be protected .
i thought i was the one they were after .
you could not be located .
so a t x was sent back through time to eliminate your lieutenants .
so she' s gonna be in the resistance ?
no , no .
no , you shouldn' t even exist .
i mean , we took out cyberdyne over 10 years ago .
we stopped judgment day .
you only postponed it .
judgment day is inevitable .
i require a cutting tool .
here , take the wheel .
what are you doing ?
i am powered by two hydrogen fuel cells .
my primary cell was damaged by a plasma attack .
t x is designed for extreme combat , driven by a plasma reactor ... ... and equipped with onboard weapons .
its arsenal includes ... ... nanotechnological transjectors .
meaning ?
it can control other machines .
its body chassis is heavily armored and hardened to withstand external attack .
you' il find a way to destroy her .
unlikely .
i' m an obsolete design .
t x is faster , more powerful and more intelligent .
it' s a far more effective killing machine .
oh , great .
that' s great .
my presence in this timeline has been anticipated .
t x is designed to terminate other cybernetic organisms .
so she' s an anti terminator terminator ?
you' ve gotta be shitting me .
no , i am not shitting you .
when ruptured , the fuel cells become unstable .
relax .
let me out of here !
relax !
man , this is wack .
it' s been like this for hours .
every goddamn station .
hey .
hey !
are you gonna pay for that ?
talk to the hand .
help !
help me !
help !
i think we better go .
jerky ?
you' re kidnapping me .
look ...
god , you were always a delinquent .
and look at you now , sitting there like the bad boy thing still works .
what are you , some kind of gang member ?
how do you live with yourself ?
what ?
tell her who i am .
john connor is leader of the worldwide resistance and last hope of humankind .
right .
and him ?
he' s a robot from the future .
living tissue over a metal skeleton , sent back in time to protect me .
go to hell .
he doesn' t mean you any harm .
i have a fianc .
he' s gonna be looking for me .
what is it that you want ?
just ... ... imagine ... ... if you knew you were gonna do something important with your life .
something amazing .
maybe the most important thing anyone has ever done .
but there' s a catch .
something terrible has to happen .
you couldn' t ... ... live with yourself if you didn' t try to stop it , but ...
what are you talking about ?
it' s just ...
the life you know ... ... all the stuff that you take for granted ... ... it' s not gonna last .
mike kripke .
back there , why did you say " kripke' s basement " ?
because mike kripke' s house ... ... that' s where the kids used to go make out , right ?
so you and me ...
wait , did we ... ?
holy shit , we did .
we made out in kripke' s basement .
i cannot believe you remembered that .
i must have made some kind of impression .
give me a break .
i only remembered because the next day you were in the news .
wait a second .
you and me hooked up the day before i first met him .
and now again , 10 years later .
we were supposed to meet .
coincidence .
yeah .
hon ?
did you just get in ?
hi , i' m detective edwards , l. a. p. d. this is detective bell .
we' re looking for katherine brewster .
is she here ?
no .
you' re her fianc , scott mason ?
yes .
there was an incident at the veterinary hospital where she works .
we' re concerned something may have happened to her .
where is she ?
we got a report from a gas station attendant near victorville ... ... about a possible kidnapping and it might be related .
i' il help you find her .
come with me .
go .
your mother ?
i never even knew where she was buried .
i hit the road the day she died .
why did you bring me here ?
no !
what are you doing ?
hey , stop !
get away from it !
stop !
sarah connor was cremated in mexico .
her friends scattered her ashes in the sea .
they stored these weapons in accordance with her will .
what happened to her ?
leukemia .
i' m sorry .
we were living in baja when she was diagnosed .
they only gave her six months .
but she fought for three years .
long enough to make sure .
to make sure ?
that the world didn' t end .
every day after this one is a gift .
she told me , " we made it .
we' re free .
but i never really believed that .
i guess she didn' t either .
you know you were about the closest thing to a father i ever had ?
how pathetic is that ?
out of my way !
my mission is to protect you .
that' s enough .
move or i' il do it !
i swear i will !
i' il shoot you !
go ahead .
see what happens .
don' t do that .
oh , my god .
this is the police .
we have the building surrounded .
release your hostage !
just leave me here .
i' m not the one you want .
you' re wasting your time .
incorrect .
john connor leads the resistance to victory .
how ?
why ?
why me ?
you are john connor .
christ , my mom fed me that bullshit since the cradle .
look at me .
i' m no leader , i never was !
i' m never gonna ...
let go .
you' re right .
you' re not the one i want .
i' m wasting my time .
fuck you , you fucking machine !
better .
oh , you were just dicking with me ?
anger is more useful than despair .
what ?
basic psychology is among my subroutines .
perps still holed up ?
gotcha .
good news .
your fiance' s okay .
where is she ?
greenlawn cemetery , up off the 5 freeway .
it' s right by the desert .
but they' re gonna bring her back to the ...
oh , my god !
oh , my dear jesus !
god !
you' re safe now .
they can' t hurt you .
kate , my name is dr. silberman .
i' m a post trauma counselor for the sheriff' s department .
how are you feeling ?
he' s not human .
he' s really not human .
i know what it' s like to be in a hostage situation .
i' ve been there myself .
the fear , the adrenaline .
you find yourself imagining things .
impossible things .
crazy things .
insane things .
take years to get over it .
go , go , go !
move it !
drop your weapon !
and the coffin !
take him down !
take him down !
resume fire !
we must reacquire katherine brewster .
why ?
what makes her so goddamn important ?
through her , you contact remnants of the military and learn how to fight skynet ... ... forming the core of the resistance .
later , your children will become important .
what ?
she' s your wife .
get in !
do you want to live ?
come on !
it was scott !
how could it be scott ?
your fianc ?
the t x is polymimetic , able to take the form of anything it touches .
your fianc is dead .
