good afternoon .
wide world of sports is in the republic of san marcos where we' re going to bring you a live , on the spot assassination .
they' re going to kill the president of this lovely country and replace him with a military dictatorship .
everybody is about as excited and tense as can be .
the weather this afternoon is perfect and , if you' ve just joined us , we' ve seen a series of colourful riots that started with the bombing of the american embassy , a ritual as old as the city itself .
then the leader of the labour union , julio doaz , was dragged from his home and beaten by an angry mob .
it was one of the most exciting spectacles i' ve ever seen .
we' il probably have a videotape replay of that later on .
all around , there are colourful flags and hats .
now the moment we' ve been waiting for is here .
everyone is getting quiet .
the president will leave his office and walk down the steps of the palace .
for that , we' re going down on the playing area .
take it away , howard .
this is tremendous , don , just tremendous .
the atmosphere heavy , uncertain , overtones of ugliness .
a reminder , in a way , of how it was in march of 1964 at miami beach when clay met liston for the first time and nobody was certain how it would turn out .
the crowd is tense .
they' ve been here since ten this morning .
and ...
and i think i see ... the door beginning to open .
el presidente may be coming out .
the door opens .
it' s he .
it' s el presidente .
he turns !
and down !
it' s over .
it' s all over for el presidente !
this reporter is going to get to him , if he can , through this mob for one last word before he expires .
as you can see , this crowd is not to be trifled with .
they' re in a frenzy .
they' re trying to get over to el presidente even as i am trying to do now .
would you people let me through ?
this is american television .
american television .
please let me through .
we' re getting through now .
here we are .
here we are .
sir .
sir , you' ve been shot .
when did you know it was all over ?
fascist ... dictator .
you' re upset .
that' s understandable under the circumstances .
i guess now you' il have to announce your retirement .
well , good luck to you , sir .
now , if you folks will bear with me for a moment ,
i' m going to try and get in a word with the new dictator of san marcos .
that' s assuming i can get through this noisy , demonstrative crowd .
i wonder if you people would let me through .
i see the general off in the distance .
the new dictator talking to one of his men .
excuse me .
excuse me , sir .
general .
general , congratulations .
general emilio molina vargas .
general , a word from you , if you will , sir , for our viewers .
for many years , i have waited for this day , but now i am the state .
you may say that , sir , but many important diplomats contend that you remain the most hated man in the state .
i will shut down the newspapers .
i will train my soldiers .
we' il find the rebels .
they may be in the form of democratic guerrilla factions off in the hills .
no , sir .
we' il find them .
don' t worry .
good luck to you , sir .
thank you , sir .
well , you' ve heard it with your own eyes .
now we' re going to have to see what the future brings .
now , from the little dictatorship of san marcos in latin america ,
let' s go back to jim mclane in our studios in new york .
gentlemen , the exec usiser .
the latest work in progress at general equipment .
it' s only in the development stage , but it should be in the market within two years .
it certainly looks impressive .
the exec usiser is a device to help busy executives exercise without ever pausing in their crowded work schedule .
more americans suffer heart attacks from lack of exercise .
you know why ?
because there aren' t enough hours in the day to keep physically fit and still function effectively in one' s business .
this is mr fielding mellish , our research tester , who will demonstrate the exec usiser .
every part of the body receives an adequate exercise work out .
the pedalling develops the muscles to keep the leg muscles flexible .
when mr mellish pulls the drawer out , a weight has to be lifted on top of the desk which exercises his arms and his back muscles .
the telephones are both spring activated .
both muscles in the biceps are given a work out to sustain flexible arms .
on the back wall , there' s a handle for each arm .
as he pulls , the back muscles are brought into action in a manner that keeps the back flexible and strong .
the basketballs at the side of the machine , as they' re handled by mr mellish , develop reflexes .
how many can you put out a year ?
we' d like you to manufacture them .
we can let you have the idea , let you have our package .
we can let you have it all on a royalty basis .
we can show you how to turn it out .
we can show you how to save money .
and you think it' il sell ?
no question .
if we can get it in the office , we can get it in the armed forces .
you' il do business with the us government .
i' m not suited to this job .
where do i come off testing products ?
machines hate me .
i should be working at a job that i have some kind of aptitude for .
donating sperm to an artificial insemination lab .
every day we gotta hear this .
why did i quit college ?
i could' ve been something today .
what would you have been ?
i don' t know .
i was in the black studies programme .
by now , i could' ve been black . .. consistent loser at the table .
that' s my weakness .

i don' t know what i' il do tonight .

i' m sorry .
i broke the point .
that' s ok .
want to come in ?
i have a pencil .
and i' il give you another pencil .

the united states should support the rebels and not the dictatorship , which , as you know , has been our history .
what do you do ?
i' m a products tester for a large corporation .
i make sure products are safe and practical .
today i tested an exercise machine and an electrically warmed toilet seat for cold days .
would you like some coffee ?
if you' re hungry , i could open a can of ribs if you want .
ribs ?
i' d love some coffee , but i have a lot of work to do .
here , i' il make you some .
it' il take two seconds to make some coffee .
how can i find out more about your cause ?
i have a lot of spare time .
would you like to volunteer for the volunteers for san marcos ?
is it possible to discuss that over dinner tomorrow night ?
doesn' t have to be tomorrow night .
i' m open for the next six years .
i have a yoga class tomorrow night and i couldn' t miss that .

the vatican' s in rome .
well , they were doing so well in rome that they opened one in denmark .
i was just saying to someone the other day that the scandinavians seem to have such an instinctive feel for the human condition .
that' s very wise .

it was ... pithy .
it had ... great pith .
yeth .
pith .
pith .
lithen , i have to ...
listen , i have to go .
i have a lot of work to do .
i' d love to have coffee , but i don' t have time .

it was nice to meet you .
nice meeting you , too .
oh , wait .
you forgot to sign my petition .
sorry .
nancy .
you may call me fielding .
i think mr mellish is a little formal .
the two of us together .
fielding from the latin meaning " strong " or " with strength " .
you' il come to lean on that strength after a while and to know you can rely on me .
i' ve always been a great champion of the underdog .
i think anyone could tell you that , my pet .
you see , nancy , i' ve always been devoted to humanity .
to a guy like me , the greatest crimes are the crimes against human dignity .
how is it ?
can you hear the music clearly ?
this should be a great seller in california .
you wanna play poker tonight ?

don' t worry .
i know what i' m doing .

leave a little air .
i love you .
i love you .
say it in french .
please say it in french .
i don' t know french .
oh , please .
please .
what about hebrew ?
i was ...
i was always very shy when it came to girls .
i remember when i was a little boy ,
i once stole a pornographic book that was printed in braille .
i used to rub the dirty parts .
and i ...
i guess i had a good relationship with my parents .
i ...
they very rarely hit ...
i think they hit me once , actually , in my whole childhood .
they started beating me on the 23rd december 1942 and stopped beating me in the late spring of ' 44 .
i was a nervous child .
i was a bed wetter .
when i was younger , i used to sleep with an electric blanket and i was constantly electrocuting myself .
it' s funny , i had this dream that i' ve had since i was a child .
i had it again one night last week .
where i' m ...
i have to tell you something and i don' t know how to break it .
fielding ...
why ?
is something the matter ?
have you seen x rays of me ?
i saw x rays of you .
i fail to see the humour of this .
you didn' t see the x rays .
tell me what' s the matter .
nothing .
you know when your heart beats ?
well , my heart is beating .
i just don' t think we should see each other any more .
really ?
yeah .
i' m sorry .
why ?
what' s the matter ?
there' s just something missing for me and i don' t know what .
what do you mean ?
something missing from me ?
yes .
what do you mean ?
like what ?
like ...
can you say what is missing from me ?
no .
maybe if you could guess a few things , i could try .
what do you mean ?
can you tell me ?
i don' t know what' s missing .
is it personality or looks ?
well , no .
am i not smart enough ?
no .
because i' m not ...
no .
it has nothing to do with height ?
it has nothing to do with the fact you' re short or the fact that you' re not bright enough .
nothing to do with the fact that your teeth are in bad shape .
so what , then ?
i don' t understand .
has it got to do with ...
it' s not my personality .
do you have fun when you' re with me ?
no ...
but it' s not that .
it' s not that i don' t have fun with you ...
we have fun when we laugh .
don' t tell me that we haven' t laughed .
it' s not that we haven' t laughed .
certainly i laugh a lot .
sometimes you don' t laugh and ...
i can' t put my finger on it .
something' s missing .
what ?
can you be specific ?
the relationship isn' t going anywhere .
where do you want to it go ?
where could we get it to go ?
that' s not ...
i don' t know where .
i love you .
i mean , i love you and you love me .
no .
and it' s not because i don' t love you .
then you love me ?
no , i don' t .
that' s what i mean ...
but that' s not why .
something is missing .
i need a very strong man .
i' m strong .
i need a leader .
i have all the qualities of leadership .
i' m interested in so many vital political things .
me , too .
that binds us together .
i wanna work with pygmies in africa .
i wanna work with lepers on a leper colony .
no , that' s perfectly ok .
i love leprosy .
if that' s what you' re asking me .
i' m perfectly willing ...
i like leprosy .
i like cholera .
i like all the major skin diseases .
you' re immature , fielding .
how am i immature ?
emotionally , sexually and intellectually .
yeah , but what other ways ?
maybe it' s my fault .
maybe i just can' t give .
why don' t you receive ?
i' il give .
i' m not ready to receive .
then you give and i' il receive .
i can' t receive ...
i' m a person who can only receive if another is giving .
i can' t give .
i' m sorry .
if we each receive , it might work .
i can' t .
my trouble is i' m receiving and i' m not able to give or receive .
i would give if you could receive .
i don' t know how i can help you .
if we both receive or both give ...
i can' t receive and i can' t give .
it' s not going to work out .
it' s no use , fielding .
i' m sorry .
goodbye .
i' m sorry if i hurt you .
don' t worry about me , sweetheart .
i' m like a cat .
i' il always wind up on my feet .
can you believe that ?
she says i' m not leader enough for her .
who' s she looking for hitler ?
women are very temperamental .
we went everyplace together .
we did everything .
we fell in love .
i fell in love .
she just stood there .
did you have trouble in bed ?
you kidding ?
do i look like the kind of guy that' d have trouble in bed ?
i didn' t .
i didn' t .
was that any reason to quit the job ?
i' m so depressed .
i' d kill myself if i thought that she would marry me .
what are you gonna do ?
i gotta get out of here .
i' m going down to san marcos .
we were gonna go down there together .
we were gonna write a paper on it .
she was gonna write it .
i was gonna type it .

i' m going down to south america .
to a country called san marcos .
i' ve never heard of it , dear .
and ...

it' s a turbulent situation and i' ve been following it for a while .

you should' ve stayed in school and followed study .
i have a son myself ...

sorry .
ruth , don' t talk to him about going away .
talk to him about becoming a doctor .
who will i leave this hospital to ?
will you cool it , martin ?

i' m going to the theatre .
and now , as is our annual custom , each citizen of san marcos will come up here and present his excellency with his weight in horse manure .
horse manure ?
i thought they were diamonds .
we are an agrarian country .
yes , but ...
we will fertilise your personal crops .
sometimes food is more valuable than gold .
we captured this rebel soldier , excellency .
has he given us any information about when they plan to strike ?
not yet , but he will when our men get through working him over .
we keep playing to him the entire score of naughty marietta .
it will make him talk .

i can' t stand operetta .
please .

i' il talk .
i' il talk .
but please turn it off .

i brought you some cake .
thank you very much .
these are prunes .
i like cherry .
they don' t make cherry on tuesday .
se ? r fielding , dinner is served .
will you please ?

i have been poisoned so many times , i have developed an immunity .
you are not tense ... are you ?
tense ?
no .
dinner was delicious .
thank you , sir .
the check , sir .
who had the roast beef ?
i had .
that' s ...
who had the corned beef and cabbage ?
that was mine .
i don' t understand something .
there' s two roast beefs on here .
what did you have ?
chilli con carne .
there' s two roast beefs .
there' s an extra roast beef .
i had only one .
there' s one chilli , two roast ...
who had the chilli ?
i had the chilli .
are you on diner' s club ?

i' m getting a headache .
and so i want to do only what is right for my people .
that is to protect them from communism .
i am sure you understand that .
esposito and his rebels are not communists .
they are communists .
i think i know a bit about politics .
i' il pick it up .
excuse me .
if i give a better life to my people ,
i have to exterminate a few troublemakers .
that' s the price we pay .
yeah , well , i gotta be going .
it' s ... late for me .
it has been a real pleasure to have this little chat with you .
viva san marcos .
viva .
viva .
he is perfect .
i could kill him now .
he brings cake .
he doesn' t even bring an assortment .
you cannot forget that ?
no , no , we' il kill him as planned dressed as rebels .
then an outraged united states will see how bloodthirsty beasts esposito and his men are and we' il get all the support we need .
when can our men get the rebel uniforms ?
the tailor is going on vacation , then he needs three days for alterations .
too long .
we' il get another tailor .
but he does such nice work .
take a look at this jacket it was much too big .
he took it in for me .
he doesn' t even charge much .
no .
we get another tailor .
i want it to look like the rebels killed him not later than tomorrow afternoon .
here he comes .
i don' t feel good in these clothes .
nor do i. he made cuffs in my pants .
what kind of tailoring is this ?
he' s not our regular man .
do the best you can .
so long , suckers .
hey , wake up .
esposito wants to see you .
you all right ?
hey , wake up .
hey , you , wake up .
esposito wants to see you .
where ...

please .
no more polish women .
we are in the rebel camp with esposito .
blood .
that should be on the inside .
esposito wants to see you .
come on .
esposito tried to kill me .
it was vargas that tried to kill you , but in the uniforms of our people .
so your government would blame esposito .
come on .
come on .
i' m fielding mellish .
vargas has told everyone you are dead .
that we killed you .
it is in all the newspapers .
yeah , well , i' m very much alive and i mean to lodge a formal complaint .
complaint ?
you cannot bash an american citizen without state department permission .
vargas cares very little for diplomatic procedures , my friend .
we' il straighten him out .
i' m afraid you cannot leave here .
he uses you to make a big propaganda against us .
he doesn' t want you to show up and tell the world the truth .
so , what do you think will happen if you show your face anyplace but here ?
he will cut your throat and bury you .
cut my throat ?
do you realise what that will do to my gargling ?
it is war , my friend .
yeah , but i' m an american citizen .
sure .
a dead one .
how long before i can go back to new york ?
after we win the revolution , we are free .
when is the revolution ?
six months .
six months ?
i got a rented car .
you have a chance to die for freedom .
freedom is wonderful .
on the other hand , if you' re dead , it' s a drawback to your sex life .
are you such a snivelling dog ?
depends what you mean .
i' m a good sized snivelling dog .
history sometimes chooses strange ways .
today you are fearful .
perhaps one day you will be a tiger .
don' t hold your breath .
if you ever need a squirrel , call me .
all right , men , let us sing the song of the rebels .
rebels are we , born to be free
just like the fish in the sea
i' il have the grapefruit sections , two poached eggs , cinnamon toast and regular coffee .
perfect .
what the hell is this stuff anyhow ?
lizard .
uno ... dos .
uno ... dos .
uno ... dos .
uno ... dos .
uno ... dos .
camouflage can often save yourlife .
it' s essential that you learn the art .
ln the event of snake bite , you make an incision and suck out the poison .

it will be very risky .
you must not go .
i do not mind the risk .
another will lead the raid .
not our future president .
what about sending fielding ?
me ?
the men have a growing respect for you .
it is a chance to prove yourself .
i don' t wanna prove anything .
you will fight a hero and , if necessary , you will die a hero .
better get some rest , luis .
you' re beginning to talk gibberish .
this short straw will go .
well , as long as it was fair .
yes ?

and ... what to drink ?
let me have 700 regular coffees , 500 cokes and 1, 000 7 ups .
and also coleslaw for 900 men .
right .
you want anything with these sandwiches ?
mayonnaise on the side .
right .
everything is ready , sir .
which one is the roll ?
i have it right here .
ok .
what about the coleslaw ?
it' s coming , sir .
adelante .
coleslaw , sir .
that will be 24, 000 pesos , sir .
get your money from vargas .
we' re the rebels .
let' s go .
move this out .
come on .
while we carry out a diversionary raid , you three will kidnap the british ambassador .
he will be held until vargas agrees to free the sympathisers he has jailed .
i will drive .
you two will seize him and you will inject him with sodium pentathol .
now , once he is asleep ... there will be no trouble .
should they attack , our men are ready .
they are too weak to defeat me .
we have nothing to worry about them .
we shall continue our policy of harassment .
of course , if they' re foolish enough to try to overthrow , then i have made a deal for reinforcements with the uja .
you mean the cla , excellency .
the uja is the united jewish appeal .
the united jewish appeal ?
any word on where we' re heading ?
i hear it' s san marcos .
for or against the government ?
cla' s not taking any chances .
some of us are for it and some of us are gonna be against it .
viva san marcos !

i' m finally going home .
well , you have earned it .
i' m gonna miss everybody .

at last this country can finally bask in the sunshine of a true democracia .
where no man is better than the next and there' s equal opportunity .
respect for law and order .
right now , i am the law .
but soon we' il hold elections , let the people choose their leaders and you can voluntarily step down and return to your simple farming .
what' s the matter ?
you look glassy eyed .
these people are peasants .
they are too ignorant to vote .
but they have common sense .
i am the ruler of this country .
there will be no elections until i decree it .
you are accused of killing over a thousand people , of torturing hundreds of women and children .
how did you plead ?
guilty .
with an explanation .
ready ... aim ... fire !
that' s ... 21 .
where' s 21 ?
ready ... aim ... fire !
hear me .
i am your new president .
from this day on , the official language of san marcos will be swedish .
silence .
ln addition to that , all citizens will be required to change their underwear every half hour .
underwear will be worn on the outside so we can check .
furthermore , all children under 16 years old are now 16 years old .
what' s the spanish word for " straitjacket " ?
the power has driven him mad .
we must have a new leader .
another must represent the revolution immediately .
who ?
someone willing to put his life in peril and willing to carry on against all the terrible hazards that await us .
i know you' re gonna find the guy .
excuse me .
i was due at my mother' s house for dinner eight months ago .
i' m going home .
no .
the revolution will fail .
why me ?
because the men respect you .
you always loved our cause .
besides , compared to these men , you are educated .
what is this with my education ?
i had two days of college .
i need three years and 363 days to get a degree .
this is a country of peasants .
at least you can read .
i don' t want to be president .
you' re making a big mistake .
you gotta be smart to be a president .
let me be vice president .
that' s a real idiot' s job .
you' re looking at me in a strange way , fellas .
look , i ...
i' m gonna be president , right ?
the americans won' t recognise us they think we' re communists .
the communists won' t recognise us they think we' re american puppets .
the one person who recognises us was arrested on a morals charge .
we need money .
what is the chief export of san marcos ?
dysentery .
we grow bananas .
bananas , bananas .
if i could only think of a way to convince the us to give us money .
get me sanchez .
i don' t know , my friend .
without it , the revolution will fail .
thousands will have died in vain and soon a new dictator will seize power .
hello ?
it' s me .
i' m perturbed over the economic situation .
you must go to the united states .
you must convince them .
they will listen to you .
me ?
you' re the president .
here i' m president .
over there i' m a college dropout .
but they don' t know .
after all , fielding mellish is dead .
i can' t hear you .
i think we have a bad connection .
hang up .
i will call you back .
i actually think i probably could go to the united states and fake it .
i know you can do it , fielding .
i' il bet that i could .
i am mr hernandez , the official interpreter .
welcome to the united states .
welcome to united states .
thank you .
thank you .
did you have a good flight ?
did you have a good flight ?
yes , i did .
yes , i did .
we hope your stay in our country we hope your stay in our country
will be delightful . will be delightful .
i am looking forward to it i am looking forward to it
with great anticipation . with great anticipation .
i' m bill simmons .
this is tom sloan .
fbl .
we' re here to see that your safety is ensured .
we' il act as your shield in the event of trouble .
we missed him .
we get most of them .
what am i appearing at a fundraising dinner for ?
i know nothing about public speaking .
all you have to do is open up with a joke , a funny story .
once you have them laughing , then you hit them for money .
simple .
very simple .
open with a funny story , then hit ' em for money .
i' m ...
i' m reminded tonight of the ... of the farmer who had incestuous relations with both his daughters simultaneously ...
it' s the ...
it' s ...
it' s the ...
it' s the ... wrong crowd for this joke .
although the united states is a very rich country and san marcos is a very poor one , there are a great many things we have to offer your country in return for aid .
for instance , there are locusts .
we ...
we have more locusts than ...
locusts of all races and creeds ...
these locusts , incidentally , are available at popular prices .
so , by the way , are most of the women of san marcos .
now , then , despite the tiny size of our nation , few people realise that we lead the world in hernias .
they also fail to realise that before columbus discovered your country , he stopped in san marcos and contracted a disease which can today be cured with one shot of penicillin .
it' s the same person , all right .
this all smacks of conspiracy .
you realise what a communist missile base in san marcos would do to us ?
plus he has a history of subversive acts , demonstrations , and peace marches .
this man is attempting the overthrow of the united states government .
all right , let' s pick him up ... and throw the book at him .
we' il make an example of this ... hepcat .
hi .
i hope i' m not being pushy , but i have always wanted to meet you .
i ...
i don' t mean to bother you , but i think that you are terrific .
really terrific .
me and my friends have backed you from the very beginning of this career of yours .
and i ...
we ...
i ...
i' m awestruck .
i really don' t know what to say .
you know , it' s very funny , but you remind me of somebody i once knew .
a boy .
he ...
he was really ...
no , he was really nothing like you .
i mean , you' re terrific .
he was just this little stupid clown .
just ...
i don' t know why i even mentioned it , but ...
he was ...
he was ...
he was an idiot .
you know , a real idiot and ...
would you ...
would you mind if i kissed you ... once ?
could i ... kiss you once ?
that was wonderful .
it was practically a religious experience .
i have a confession to make .
what , love ?
i' m fielding mellish .
my god .
i knew something was missing .
good evening .
i' m roger grimsby with the news at six .

please rise .
court is now in session .
judge seymour watson presiding .

a new york jewish intellectual communist crackpot .
i mean , i don' t wanna cast no aspersions .
your witness .
officer dowd , have you ever had sexual relations with a girl with really big breasts ?
yes , sir .
i did .
and how did you find it ?
very erotic .
i was ...
i was just checking .
swear to tell the truth , the whole truth and nothing but the truth ?
i do .
name ?
j edgar hoover .
occupation ?
head of the fbl .
tell the court why you' re dressed like this .
i have many enemies and i rarely go out unless i' m in disguise .
mr hoover , in your opinion , is fielding mellish a threat to the security of the united states ?
enough to have his phone tapped .
hello ?
hello ?
who is this ?
who is this ?
hello ?
who is this ?
can you hold on one second ?
walter , it' s foryou .
all right , i did it !
i did it !
i' m guilty !

she kept tormenting me .
egging me on .
making a fool of me !

sorry to disappoint you , but i' ve known fielding for years and he' s a warm , wonderful human being .

miss america .
o mio babbino caro
mi piace ? bello , bello

tell the court why you think he is a traitor to this country .
i think mr mellish is a traitor to this country because his views are different from the views of the president and others of his kind .
differences of opinion should be tolerated , but not when they' re too different .
then he becomes a subversive mother .
call fielding mellish .
mr mellish ... what is your nationality ?
well , you might say i have two nationalities .
are you being coy ?
well , i am an american citizen and also the president of san marcos .
i would not joke with this court if i were you .
wouldn' t you or couldn' t you ?
that' s enough .
does the codename sapphire mean anything to you ?
it doesn' t .
i swear to god .
you swear to god and yet you have no compunction about teaching evolution .
where were you on the night of june 23rd ?
if you cannot resist disrupting the court ,
i order the marshal to bind and gag you .
so you followed fielding mellish and overheard him make treasonous remarks about this country ?
i did .
your witness .
yes , i did .
no .
i don' t remember .
no .
don' t put words in my mouth !
yes .
yes , it' s true .
i lied !
ladies and gentlemen , you will retire for your verdict .
good evening .
i' m roger grimsby with the news at six .
a verdict has been reached in the mellish case .
i' il have details in one moment .
stick in your throat , son ?
these cigarettes , father .
what brand are you smoking ?
these .
well , those are for sinners .
try these new testament cigarettes .
new testament ?
they' ve got the incense filter .
i' il try one .
what do you think ?
good flavour .
smooth , too .
stick to new testament cigarettes and all is forgiven .
thank you , father .
new testament cigarettes .
i smoke ' em .
he smokes ' em .
fielding mellish was found guilty today on 12 counts of treason and was sentenced to 15 years in prison .
the judge suspended it in return for their promise that mellish will not move into his neighbourhood .
now this is all over , is there any possibility that maybe we could get married ?
i' d love to .
would you ?
i mean , being in women' s lib , you' il need somebody to support you .
fielding , do you love me ?
of course i love you .
no , but do you love me ?
you know what i mean ?
yes , i love you .
i love you .
can you , like , define the meaning of love ?
what do you mean ?
it' s love .
i love you .
i want you in a way of cherishing your totality and your otherness and in the sense of a presence and a being and a whole coming and going in a room with grapefruit and a love of a thing , of nature and a sense of not wanting or being jealous of the thing a person possesses .
do you have any gum ?
good evening .
wide world ofsports is here in the royal manhattan hotel for a live , on the spot telecast of the fielding mellish honeymoon .
mellish and his new bride were married in a civil ceremony in downtown manhattan .
the bride wore the traditional virginal white , as did mellish .
they had dinner and are both now ready for the consummation of their marriage .
the turnout has been gigantic , and here for a play by play description is howard cosell .
take it away , howard .
you join us with the action just about to start .
yes , indeed .
here comes the bride and she' s got a lot of fans here .
they are tense , but they swell to a tremendous cheer .
and , as i think is apparent , she is in very good physical condition .
and here comes mellish .
listen to that crowd roar .
he is wearing a green corduroy suit , jogging and bobbing down the aisle , buttressed by his trainer and his handlers .
the action has started .
they approach one another cautiously .
nothing unique about that .
now ...
mellish begins to make his moves and so does nancy .
the two are working together closely , the action growing more rigorous .
it is swift , rhythmic , coordinated .
what' s that ?
a cut over mellish' s right eye .
the doctor comes in to examine the cut .
no , it will not be stopped .
it continues .
i tell you , ladies and gentlemen , i' ve never seen action like this .
that' s it .
it' s over .
it' s all over .
the marriage has been consummated .
nancy and fielding mellish , in the most real sense , are now man and wife .
if it' s humanly possible , i' il break through these fans to talk to the two .
excuse me .
excuse me .
nancy , i know that this is very personal , but was it everything you expected ?
well , howard , it all went by so fast .
i had no idea that it' d be so quick .
i was expecting a longer bout .
no difficulties of any kind ?
well , as you know , i' m extraordinarily ticklish so i had a rough time there .
i couldn' t stop laughing .
i thought it' d really get in my way .
but i really trained well for this and i think it held me so there really wasn' t any time that i didn' t feel in control .
how about you , fielding ?
i was concerned about that cut .
i thought they might stop the action .
did you feel that ?
yes .
i thought that i' d have to finish it up quick .
i thought the referee might come in and stop it .
i knew i was leading at that point and i was just hoping that they' d let me go all the way and i did .
no disappointments at all ?
i had heard he' d be in great shape .
and i felt that he ... he wasn' t , that he could use a little seasoning .
the timing was a little off , but i think he' il be fine .
he' s not the worst i' ve had .
not the best , but not the worst .
are you offended by what nancy just said , fielding ?
i' m not offended , but i don' t agree .
i was in great shape .
i thought i had her in real trouble with the right hand .
i was in good form .
my breathing was good .
i' ve been training very hard for this .
i just gave a hundred per cent .
when do you anticipate your next bout ?
i think we could probably do this again in the late spring .
are you ...
ln the late spring ?
well , i think i' il be ready by the late spring ...
as long as the late spring ?
i think we should leave the happy couple on that note .
it' s hard to tell what may happen in the future .
they may live happily ever after .
again , they may not .
be assured of this , though .
wherever the action is , we will be there with abc' s wide world ofsports to cover it .
now , on behalf of nancy and fielding mellish and the others who have made this possible , this is howard cosell thanking you for joining us and wishing you a most pleasant good night .
