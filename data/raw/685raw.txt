there wasn' t always a war with the centauri but in my lifetime , it' s all i' ve ever known .
by the year 2050 , six years after the first attack we' d lost so many things .
we' d lost the sky to electromagnetic domes to shield the earth from frequent air raids increasing in intensity .
we' d lost the uncovered cities that the government forgot .
we' d lost democracy to global leadership .
we didn' t expect peace anymore with the centauri because we came to see that peace wasn' t their goal .
their goal was earth .
the ultimate land war , with no boundaries .
when i was a boy , i built toy rockets .
i wanted to explore space and discover new worlds .
i' ve never seen a centauri , but i knew what my father told me .
i knew they were an alien race ,
they were genetically superior and they came after us with no mercy .
i also knew they were the last thing my father saw .
i stopped building rockets .
there was no need for them .
i built weapons instead .
and i know my salvation .
her name is maya .
a little hotter .
that' s good .
music on .
no , no .
something else .
hooker , john lee .
that' s good .
go , johnny lee !
tv on .

hoping to catch a glimpse of their beloved leader hundreds of people have thronged the ballard space port as citywide preparations are made for the chancellor' s arrival ...
spence , it' s on !
music off .
water off . ... last week' s brutal centauri attack on the tolstoy colony of asteroid x 83 .
what' d i miss ?
alighting from a recent briefing with high ranking officials at sector eight the chancellor visits our region for a secret meeting with government scientists .
some secret .
tolstoy colony was a bastion of peace and free expression in this grievous time of war .
why do they leak these things ?
they want us to think that she' s joan of arc and not some warmonger .
tonight , we' il both be shaking hands with that warmonger .
with one deadly strike ...
centauri stormtroopers annihilated this idyilic community .
well , i hope she likes talking politics .
this war crime will be avenged .
firefighter robots have finally extinguished the blaze which has devastated sutton wood .
over 600 acres of forest were razed and authorities have closed off the area to all hikers and picnickers .
the cause of the fire is unknown but careless campers are most likely to blame .
morning , mr. siegel .
morning , spence .
i don' t think they' il get through the dome today .
they can , and they will , sir .
they can and they will .
come to me , baby .
come to me .
a mob of raucous anti war protesters clashed with military troops , leading to 50 arrests .
the poorly organized faction expressed opposition to the chancellor' s strategic response initiatives and the faction' s disruption of a transit facility was declared a mercury class public safety threat .
the protest was dissembled thanks to a swift response by military leaders .
no fatalities were reported , nor were there any ...

did security ask you for a voice print ?
no .
strange .
it' s never done that before .
they' re gearing up for big sister .
what do you suggest i do ?
we could ask evac to reroute .
oh , to a worse hospital .
forget it .
i am all for the war effort .
i' m not interested in the war effort .
i just care about saving as many women as i possibly can .
good morning , dr. olham .

this morning i' m saying good bye to my youngest and he says i swear to god
dada , when i grow up
i want to be in waste management .

oppenheimer tests the first atomic bomb in alamogordo , new mexico .
ah .
three weeks later the weapon hits ground zero in hiroshima , japan wiping out 140, 000 people .
oppenheimer sees the madness and urges the un to gain control of thermonuclear development .
government turns around and calls him a communist sympathizer .
let the celebration begin .
and when it was all over
einstein said
only two things are infinite : " the universe and human stupidity and i' m not sure about the universe .
what' s the matter with you ?
nothing .
i' d say it' s ambivalence .
i don' t have that luxury , myself but then again , i see our people die every day .
have we met ?
this weapon is a godsend .
it will ensure the preservation of our race and our faith .

three days ago our special ops team intercepted a centauri intelligence courier .
this was on its body .
centauri .
your native tongue .
sounds like a wild boar on the make .
anyway ... we muddled through it and decoded your plan to infiltrate our installations using humanoid robots .
what ? !
i' m a scientist .
you' re a scientist .
you know , you things are really something .
it' s not a mechanical robot at all ... but a genetic cyborg evolved from synthetic dna .
it breathes ... sweats , bleeds ... but right here , right now it seems to have no idea what it is .
now this will really excite you .
a centauri hit list .
humans targeted for murder and then replication .
this morning we found your target
olham' s name on that list .
wha ...
wait a minute .
this is a mistake .
now , l l i ...
i know you think you know what' s going on here but i can clear this up very quickly .
we have tests
we " ? methods you can run a spiral core pet scan ...
we " ?
we " who ? or dna amplification using a ...
oh , i see you' ve learned to patronize , as well .
please , listen to me .
dna amplification ...
your needle ship penetrated our outer dome .
you murdered spencer olham when he was most vulnerable .
somewhere outside the city .
somewhere unrestricted .
where ?
where is your ship ? !
this is insane .
please , please listen to me .
i know you' re a tool for assassination .
you have no proof .
your meeting tonight with the chancellor that' s when you would detonate .
i am spencer olham , you crazy fuck !
do you know when my dog pleases me most ?
it' s when he displays human qualities .
sometimes he cocks his head , puzzled .
you' re not the prototype .
we found this cyborg trying to pass himself off as an engineer at one of our mars bases .
i' m telling you , my name is jack stoller !
you' re making a mistake !
i got a wife and two kids !
please don' t do this !

the centauri u bomb .
annoying , isn' t it ?
if i could blow us all to hell , then what are you doing here ?

i sat with you all night and i asked you if you ever regretted having kids in this miserable war , and you said , " no , because they

they made it all worth it .
it' s me , nelson .
it' s me .

maya , please listen to me .
they want me dead !
listen , there' s a test .
in the hospital .

wake up the nmr team , put them on standby .
i want a hot link into the census bureau comm center in case they get a hit that we don' t .
one more thing turn off these fucking alarms !
major !
i have the secretary of defense calling for you .
i' il bet you do .
why are we having this conversation ?
i take full responsibility .
effective immediately
i' il hand the matter over to captain burke .
he' s a good man .
pick up your weapon , major .
a good man is not what i need .
is the replicant still pursuing its target ?
we don' t know .
what is the range of the bomb ?
we don' t know .
is there a secondary trigger ?
we don' t know .
given that the chancellor is landing in four hours is there anything you do know ?
we know it' s either in the evac tunnels or out in the zone .
i recommend you evacuate the city immediately .
you recommend that i set off a mass panic and you can' t even show me an x ray ?
mr. secretary ... the centauri are well ahead of us in nanotechnology .
the bomb , it eludes standard detection .
the explosive parts coalesce at trigger phase .
that' s when you' d hear a big boom .
don' t fuck with me , major .
now , tell me how we deactivate it .
we shoot it .
we can' t shoot it . because you can' t contain it .
it believes it is human .
it wants to live .
it knows fear .
it will make a mistake .
in the genius lies the defect .
lucky for us ... it bleeds .
and how many innocent men bled for your mistakes before you uncovered the first replicant ?
ten .
you don' t lose any sleep over those dead men do you , hathaway ?
we lost ten and saved 10, 000 .
i sleep like a baby , mr. secretary .

associate director of veterans hospital , central city sector .
she' s my connection .
and she' il do anything ... to get her husband back alive .
now i know that you can run me into that city underground and i can get you inside that hospital supply .
in and out , clean .
so , what' s it going to be ?
dr. olham ...
i' d like to convey my ... my deepest regrets .
i had ... great respect for your husband his work .
we ...
we all mourn with you .
i' m major hathaway .
yes , i know who you are .
we haven' t found your husband' s body yet but every effort is being made to locate his murderer this " impostor ...
don' t you think i' d know my own husband , major ?
i think we' d all like to believe that this never happened .
and when did it happen ?
this " switch ?
while we slept ?
while he showered ?
when ?
we don' t know when .
oh , so , you don' t know for certain then , do you ?
we know that the replicant poses a real threat to the public , dr. olham .
and since it believes it is your husband it will likely contact you turn to you for assistance or may have already .
do you have a wife , major ?
pardon ?
do you have a wife ?
yes .
does she know you very well ?
she knows i' m a human , if that' s what you mean .
and how does she know that ?
because i' m not on a centauri hit list and i' m not walking around with a bomb in my ribcage .
and for every second that we debate known facts , we are closer to mass murder .
so i need to ask you a couple of simple questions .
has it contacted you ?
no .
do you have any idea where it might go ?
none .
i' m sure if something occurs to you you' il let lieutenant burrows know immediately .
my men will be escorting you home ... to grieve .
i have six wards running at twice capacity , major .
i' il grieve when my shift is over .
nelson gittes is dead .
murdered by the replicant along with two of my men .
oh , i' m sorry for them , too .
take off your jacket .
there' s a big difference between you and me and i' m not talking about the obvious .
see , me , i ghost in and ghost out of the city .
you , the esa will pick you off at the first census post .
you' re going to strip my cimcode ?
like i said , take it off .
he' s going to need a knockout .
i don' t have that much .
whatever you got , keep it topical .
already got enough shit in me to embalm a horse .
government issue mercury pentothal , my guess .
hmm , powerful drug .
give you bad dreams .
yeah .
i' ve noticed .
you got anything to flush it with ?
adrenozine , maybe , but if we had that this would be a real hospital , and , uh , i' d be a real doctor .
watch his spinal cord .
you sure you don' t want to be out for this ?
oh , shit .
this hurts .
well ... now nobody' s going to know you when you' re visiting .
hey , put this on .
and get rid of that g coat .
no , i' il , uh ...
i' il hold on to it .
could be useful .
what' d she do with the cimcode ?
don' t worry about the cimcode .
she' il shred it .
now , let' s go .
l l i' d like to keep it .
souvenir .
hey .
wait here .
wait right here .
what' s up , guys ?
hey .
there' s definitely something strange about that guy ...
i think you' ve got some things you forgot to share with me ...
spencer .
what did they tell you ?
because if we don' t have honesty in our relationship we have a dead relationship .
i' m not what they say i am .
then what are you ?
just tell me what they said .
no , i want you to tell me .
i want to hear it from you .
you tell me .
they told you ... that they couldn' t surface because it' s too hot up there .
there' s too many military looking for someone with my face and my name .
and what else ?
what else ?
doesn' t this seem a little off ?
your friends know i' m public enemy number one , that i' m worth something and then they just walk away .
does that seem like your friends ?
how about a trade , cale ?
let' s talk trade .
come on !
come on !
hey !
safety .
where' d you learn to fight like that ?
what' s your name ?
cale .
is there anything else you want to know ?
no .
well , being that we' ve become so goddamn friendly why don' t you tell me what i want to know ?
all right , cale .
the esa think i' m a centauri robot .
they think i have a bomb inside my heart and that i' ve been programmed to kill the chancellor .

there' s 80, 000 square feet down there , major .
we' re still searching .
of course they are .
as reported earlier the chancellor was scheduled to return to the city for a function at the defense bureau earlier tonight but that event was canceled without explanation and the chancellor' s precise whereabouts are unclear .
that blaze in sutton wood seems to be finally coming under control .
fire fighting robots are said to have 90 % containment as of this hour .
investigators are still unable to declare an official cause of the fire but they say they are taking seriously eyewitness reports about an electrical anomaly in the sutton dome just a few hours ...
they went camping this weekend up in sutton wood .
dome authority has already ruled out a lightning strike ...
lucky you missed the fire . ... as the cause of that anomaly .
maya .
are they still there ?
are they right outside ?
maya , listen to me .
if it' s safe , then meet me ...
don' t say any more .
you' ve got to trust me .
trust me ...
spence .
please !
if you still believe in me ... all i ask is that you ... you meet me .
meet me where we first met .
that' s all i ask .
spence ? !
spence ? !
keep walking !
where are you ?
maya .
oh , god .
did they follow you ?
no .
i know you' re afraid .
i know what they told you .
that some ship got through the dome and landed somewhere outside the city .
a cyborg destroyed my body .
they were right ... in theory but they made one crucial error ...
i don' t understand .
the ship crashed .
you see , that' s what that' s what caused the fire .
they miscalculated .
the centauri never got to me !
i know the ship is here .
i can find it .
i' il show you .
do you believe them ?
you' re bleeding .
do you believe them ?
i don' t know what to believe .
they were in the house for hours .
they told me things ...
they said you killed nelson .
they searched the house .
they they ... they went through our clothes ...
did they hurt you ?
no .
they kept grilling me ... asking me for proof of god .
all i could think of was you .
i don' t expect anything from you .
i just wanted to see you again .
no .
what ?
i don' t believe them .
you' re the only one i can trust .
i love you .
they' il kill you !
spence !
we got to find the body .
we got to get inside !
we got to find the pilot !
maya , help me !
olham !
spencer !
you were wrong !
yes , i was wrong .
you were wrong !
i know that now .
you listen to me .
you need to come over here with us .
come on .
spencer , listen to me .
spencer , listen .
we decoded more of the centauri hit list .
cryptography had it wrong .
you need to come over here with us , spencer .

what' s in there .
go ahead , shoot me .
spencer , you don' t want ...

just shoot me .
go ahead .
you do not want to see what' s in there .
shoot me .
you do not want to see ...
spencer ... it wasn' t you who they wanted .
you were the link to the chancellor .
please ...
it was her target .
yes .
you were just a decoy a dupe .
spencer , please , don' t believe him .
that is not your wife .
that thing ... murdered your wife .
don' t listen to them ... please ... don' t !
look at me .
come to me .
no ... no ...
steady .

i didn' t know .

this morning , we ...

it would' ve massacred us all .

major !

oh , god ...
if that' s olham ...
we' ve been able to accelerate your regimen in the past two weeks but i need you to keep coming back , huh ?
you' re not all better yet .
now this is the medicine i need you to take .
observable from space this is the blast as seen from a defense platform ...
i' m all right .
feel better , huh ? ... 14, 000 kilometers above earth .
and it is now also confirmed that among the several thousand casualties were major d. h. hathaway of the earth security agency
dr. maya june olham of the veterans hospital administration and dr. spencer john olham , with the defense bureau .
spencer olham had been wanted in connection with espionage charges , which came as a shock to many who remembered him only as a deeply principled and patriotic man .
we lose lives to progress .
it' s a necessary sacrifice .
as a layman ...
i want to see peace in my lifetime .
dr. olham , if i could just get you to elaborate just a little bit on ....
no .
no .
you' il excuse me .
i , uh , i was just on my way home to reacquaint myself with my wife .
thank you , sir .
you knew him ?
the government' s increased scrutiny comes as a result of the discovery of biocontaminants ...
i' d like to think so .
