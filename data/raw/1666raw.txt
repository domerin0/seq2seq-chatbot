it belongs to dick , dick hotchkiss , a california state senator .
you remember dick .
he tried to ban rap music ... ... because he feels the lyrics promote violence .
it' s music , dick !
he also wants to pull every video game off every shelf in the country ... ... because he feels that the video games diminish the intelligence of our youth .

augustus gibbons .
you seem upset .
is there a problem ?
what is this place ?
looks like a diner .
that' s clever .
you almost had me going there for a while .
i was a bit groggy before , then i started noticing things .
like , you got a stockbroker over here , all dressed up ... ... reading the financial times on sunday when the market' s closed .
unlikely , but okay , i can go with that .
i could even go with the stick up man packing a cop issue beretta .
but you want to know where you blew it ?
with her .
my aunt was in the restaurant business .
there' s no way a career waitress comes to work in high heels .
she' d have blisters the size of pancakes .
and if she ain' t real , then this whole thing ain' t real .
that' s how i knew that this bozo wouldn' t get a shot off ... ... even if we waited till st. patrick' s day .
because there' s nothing but blanks in these guns .
oh , and no offense ... ... but their performances were terrible .
that' s good .
that' s very good .
it' s your turn , pretty boy .
what the hell is going on here ?
it was a test that you aced .
he seems to have a poor attitude .
excuse me ?

hell , no .
i love his attitude .
let' s take this to the next level .
get on the sat com .

you monkeys are too good for me .
i failed this test .
you guys got something to drink ?
nice to see you again , fellas .
yeah , you too .
boy , they went all out on this one .
you' ve got to be kidding .
okay , funny guys .
i' il show you what we do when you get in our business .
what ?
hog tie us and force us to listen to your bad accent ?
no .
we cut their achilles tendon and watch them flop around like a marionette .
unless you have something to tell me , something i need to know ?
okay .
you' re short .
my friend says you could use a haircut to update your style .
get off me .
shut up !
two seconds ago you told us to talk .
now it' s " shut up ?
i don' t mean to nitpick , but you' re the worst at this torture thing .
you slap me again , i' m going to throw you a beating .
i hope they' re paying you extra for this .
you know what , funny guy ?
maybe i' il cut off your nose first .
funny guy .
what' s funny is , this actually smells like real blood .
i hope you like it , because it' s the last thing you' re going to smell .
i' m hit !
i' m hit !
i' m hit !
virg !
give me a hand .
this is the colombian army !
give up , you' re surrounded !
try to walk , t. j. try to walk .
virg !
get out here !
to hell with this .
every man for himself .
i' il get us some wheels .
hang in there .
good luck .
the guy on the bike , that' s the drug lord !
let' s get him !
t. j. !
x !
i' m over here !
x !
there he is !
we toasted his ass !
i got us a bike .
pussies !
look who it is .
frankenstein .
uncuff me so i can beat the shit out of you .
relax , x , you just graduated at the head of your class .
what are you talking about ?
you almost got us killed .
we knew the army was moving .
excuse me ?
it was my idea to send you as a decoy .
how do you like that ?
you' re pretty fast for an old man .
get up .
walk with me .
i believe under the right circumstances , a man can change .
for instance , last night you exhibited courage , leadership ... ... and willingness to protect a man you hardly knew .
so give me a medal .
i' d rather give you a job .
look at me .
do i look like a fan of law enforcement ?
this is your lucky day , xander .
this is your chance to pay your uncle sam ... ... for all your wonderful freedoms .
the job' s not that difficult .
i want you to meet people and find out what you can about them .
what type of people ?
dangerous , dirty , tattooed , uncivilized .
your kind of people .
hold up .
my kind of people would say , " kiss my ass , scarface .
usually i' d take my gun , press it to your temple ... ... and ask you very politely to do what i want .
but you' re not afraid of death .
that puts us in a quandary .
we better call this a day , then .
not just yet .
you ever watch lions at the zoo ?
you can tell which were captured in the wild by the look in their eyes .
the wild cat .
she remembers running across the plain , the thrill of the hunt .
four hundred pounds of killing fury locked in a box .
but after a while , their eyes glaze over ... ... and you can tell their soul has died .
the same thing happens to a man .
leavenworth federal penitentiary is no joke .
they' il take a wild man and throw him in solitary just for fun .
no more mountains to board , no more oceans to surf .
just a 6 by 8 cell with no window and only a bucket to shit in .
you can avoid that by doing me this favor .
you don' t have shit on me .
i noticed you have three x' s tattooed on the back of your neck .
i think that' s rather appropriate since you' re looking at three strikes .
grand theft , reckless endangerment , and that bridge stunt of yours ... ... makes you a three time loser .
maybe you ought to call yourself " triple x.
but if you do what i want , i' il make all your transgressions go away ... ... and let you get back to that pathetic excuse of a life .
or you think maybe i should be like you .
get all shot up for the old stars and stripes .
i bet that flag is a real comfort every time you look in the mirror .
a small price i paid for putting foot to ass for my country .
so , what' s it going to be , triple x ?
you want to get on a plane ... ... or is " kiss my ass , scarface " your final answer ?
prague , czech republic
yo .
what' s your name , slick ?
my name is lvan .
lvan ?
what' s your name , buddy ?
my name is lvan .

i told you to sit down .
i' ve just been on a plane for 12 hours .
i think i' il stand .
my name is milan sova , czech secret police .
here , you are under my jurisdiction .
you take my orders , you do what i say .
if you become any kind of an inconvenience , i' il shoot you .
that' s great .
is this where i' m staying ?
your government is putting pressure on mine .
this is an internal czech affair that you are interfering with .
don' t shit in my lawn .
get whatever information your government seeks and get out .
let' s get this straight .
you may not want me here , but i definitely don' t want to be here .
two , i' ve never been under anyone' s jurisdiction .
three , if you' re going to shoot anybody ... ... shoot that monkey that sold you the suit .
now , i' m tired .
i' m going to sleep .

they' re rich and they' re criminals .
i' il fit in , except for the rich part .

cops like plague .
no matter how many you pay , there' s always another with his hand out .
i' m from the streets .
i know cops , believe me .
i appreciate you bringing this to our attention .
my question to you is why ?

ferraris , high end pasta rockets , 10 to start .
this car , number 10 , will be very difficult to find in europe .
that one' s for me .
i put it in there to get something out of the deal .
well , you certainly know your cars .
yeah .
cars , bikes , boards .
you name it .
i like anything fast enough to do something stupid in .
yes .
ten cars is hardly worth the effort .
a lousy 1 . 5 million , u. s.
now , hold on a second .
the american buyers i represent , to them , 10 cars is an appetizer .
and it' s a mil max , sister .
how about a million four ?
i was thinking more like a mil two .
do you know what a wire transfer is ?
is she for real ?
sweetheart , is there anything you need to do ?
let us big boys have a conversation .
conversation , " a word with four syilables .
do you want some ice before your brain overheats ?
ice .
yeah , you could chisel some off your heart , if you could find it .
this would work a lot faster , princess , if i had an account number .
you have 48 hours to complete the transfer .
don' t waste my time .
i wouldn' t dream of it .
i might throw in a couple extra bucks and send you to charm school .
now that business is finished , we party .
bitches , come !

but when you kill a bottle of vodka in three swigs , you' il talk .
i got something else .
what ?
their personal bank account number .
where did i put that ?
stolen cars , nightclubs , prostitution , extortion .
what' s the big deal ?
we got criminals like this in the u. s.
your job isn' t to ask questions .

these are all attachment darts .
see the green ones ?
datura knockout darts .
guy goes down for 12 hours , wakes up , doesn' t know who he is ... ... and his head' s splitting like a cord of firewood .
i was shot twice by those .
and the red ones are tranquilizer and blood splatter darts .
looks like a kill shot without the aftereffects .
like death .
you' ve got exploding and surveillance darts ... ... and your standard . 44 caliber bullets , if you want to get nasty .
a little wet work .
you know what i' m talking about , right ?

beautiful .
you like the cars ?
i love the cars , they' re dope .
you like the money ?
i love money , but i do not have it .
you look like you' re doing very well .
all these employees , beautiful cars .
this is no time for being funny .
you didn' t think i wasn' t good for it ?
it never crossed my mind .
a cargo ship' s waiting for you in rijeka .
here' s the address .
this place is dope .
this one' s mine ?
car number 10 .
kolya found it hiding in berlin .
it was very difficult to find .

that cigarette will kill you one day .
i like smoke better than air .
if i could , i' d smoke in my sleep .
i would still do it after it kills me .
you were talking about anarchy 99 .
what is that , some motorcycle gang of yours ?
it' s what we' ve been living since 1999 when we left the army of mother russia .
many of our comrades died in combat , and we said , " to hell with this shit .
they die for what ?
politics ?
whose politics ?
not ours !
so we decide from then on to do what we want , when we want .
it is in their honor we call ourselves anarchy 99 .
you know , there' s an old punk song .
you got it !
" anarchy burger " by the vandals .
i' m with you , but what are you going to do ?

you' re not supposed to be in here .
i was on my way to the bathroom .
what' s your excuse ?
i don' t need an excuse .
oh , you' re good .
but not that good .
i came in here to photograph yorgi' s safe .
i thought it might be worth a lot to somebody .
come on .
you' re cold , intelligent and vicious .
it' s your eyes that give you away .
they gave you away when i shot that cop .
what are you going to do now ?
now i' m going to take you to lunch .
oh , and that cop i shot , isn' t dead .
i have some information for you .
i can always use information .

yes .
important information that you need about xander cage .
so you don' t like foreigners , do you ?
no , you' re a pig .

you should recognize one of your kind .
now , tell me about the cop .
what if i told you i' m not who you think i am ?
that i could get you out of the mess you' re in ?
really ?
and what mess am i in ?
the mess that makes you sneak around the castle when everyone' s asleep .
the cop ?

it' s called a blood splatter dart .
the impact' s real , but it' s harmless .
red paint , mostly .

what do you want ?
i need to know more about anarchy 99 .
you want to know about anarchy 99 ?
you' ve seen the girls , the clubs , the parties .

there' s been a lot of activity in the last year .
people coming in and out .
russian scientists .

what do you mean the cards have been dealt ?
you don' t even know her , man .
oh , by the way , that bank number you gave us ?
your friends and yelena have made some large cash transfers ... ... to a group of russian scientists known to specialize and traffic ... ... in biological weapons .
she had nothing to do with it .
go home .
she ain' t !
that' s an order .
how' s it going ?
life is shit !
yeah , well what can you do ?
through this door , you are with us to the end .
are you sure that' s what you want ?
i' m sure .
this is ahab .
think of it as solar powered submarine .
it can circumnavigate the globe to reach its target .
it need only surface to gather sunshine and to do its business .
what is it ?
what' s its business ?
dropping off presents to all the good little boys and girls .
my team will be finished tomorrow .
how about you ?
we' re finished now .
nikolai !
bring the rockets .
the detonator is for you .
yorgi !
the binary agents are mixing ... ... it will kill us all !
looks like little white mouse .
bye bye , little mouse .
my god .
they did their job and now they were liability .
we don' t need anyone talking about our business .
the gas gets sucked through the extractor fans , passed into water ... ... and broken down to become , once again , completely harmless .
so quiet .
i know now why they call it silent night .
let' s get some food .
find out what' s going on !
what the hell was that ?
that works .
fire in the hole .
sova .
what are you doing here , man ?
first you set me up in the bar .
then you shoot me in the back .
my boss does it to me .
i did it to you .
it' s a vicious circle .
you think it' s funny ?
no .
you didn' t take it personally , did you ?
i did what i had to do to get in .
we' re on the same side .
i' m sorry .
i switched sides .
you pushed me too far .
my government doesn' t pay as well as yorgi .
my government pays twice as much
think you could just walk into the spy business ...
... and have all the angles figured out ?
what are you going to do , shoot me ?
where ?
in the head , to be quick ?
or in the chest for an open casket , so i can see your heart ?
can i think about it ?
what are you doing ? !
i heard you talking .
i could tell where you were in the room .
what are you doing with the lvans ?
what' s going on ?
there' s something i didn' t have the time to tell you .
i' m an agent as well .
i' m an agent for fsb , russian intelligence .
you know , like your cla .
i' ve been undercover for two years .
two years ?
what was your plan , let them die of old age ?
there was no plan .
a year ago , intelligence gets reorganized , i stop getting orders .
they forget about me .
and i did what i must to survive .
you understand ?
what do i understand ?
i' ve been an agent for a week .
but my boss needs to know what we know now .
okay ?
okay .
the submarine' s purpose is to deploy a nerve agent called silent night .
it' s been missing since the soviet union' s collapse in ' 91 .
it can kill millions .
we knew they were up to something .
you found out .
that' s excellent work , triple x.
there was never a sweeper team .
if i said don' t jump off the empire state building ....
you' re right .
i' d definitely do it .
i inspired you .
i' m an authority figure , that' s what i' m supposed to do .
look , my men are on this now .
it' s time for you to come home .
what about yelena ?
i' m not authorized to give her asylum .
but i promise it' il be done by the time you get here .
come home , xander .
that' s an order .
how soon can yorgi launch this thing ?
you were told to go home !
your people are handling
how soon , yelena ?
soon .
but it' s not our problem anymore !
if they get ahead of schedule , it' s everyone' s .
he' s got an army , a fortress .
you don' t stand a chance !
i' ve risked my life for stupid reasons .
this is the first one that makes sense .
this is not one of your stunts .
you' il die in this , you know that .
if you don' t go back in there ... ... he' il know something' s wrong .
you can' t ask me to go back there .
you can' t .
you want to know something ironic ?
i volunteered for this assignment .
i wanted to make a difference .
i fought for it .
then finish it .
remember what i told you , after you kissed me ?
never again ?
i lied .
but when you break it down , i' m a simple man .
i' d be happy with a beautiful czech girl
hey , geek !
got new orders from gibbons .
get in .
i want all that in here .
done .
the castle' s covered with surveillance cameras .
that' s why we cannot get close enough .
hang on .
that' s why i need to knock out the communications tower ... ... at the base of the mountain .
is there anyone here who knows how to fly a plane ?
i can .
too much turbulence around these mountains !
just get me in line with that tower !
i' il do the rest !
go now !
viktor !
we got company !
catch him fast .
kill him slow !
nothing like fresh powder .
yelena , my sweet dove , did you get confused ?
your assignment was to kill the cop after he killed x.
not good for undercover agent from russian intelligence .
i knew about you all along ... ... and it was my pleasure to twist you and use you how i saw fit .
and you .
of all people , i thought you' d understand ... ... what i' m trying to accomplish .
can you imagine ?
imagine a city like prague vanishing ... ... in a cloud of poison gas .
then hamburg , london , washington .
imagine not knowing who did it , or why .
and so they turn on each other .
these guys attack those guys .
those guys invade these guys .
soon , whole world implodes .
imagine governments disappearing .
and in the end ... ... imagine facing absolute , beautiful freedom .
but neither of you will be there to see it .
like viktor .
like kolya .
cover me !
get me out of this thing !
he took the hard drive .
he' s going to launch ahab !
pick one .
ivan , take out that nest !
you have to turn the safety off .
hold them off as long as you can .
see you , my friend .
come on , baby .
stop !
he' s got us pinned down .
shit .
you got a bazooka !
stop thinking prague police and start thinking playstation .
blow shit up !
this is not bazooka .
this is heat seeker rocket .
heat seeker ?
set it .
the son of a bitch is smoking .
i told him that cigarette would kill him .
learn how to shoot , piece of shit !
quick !
help me pull him out !
it will hit the city in 30 minutes !
guys .
i need a helicopter .
i need transportation .
i need a
x , there you are .
i gave you everything you wanted .
this thing will damn near fly now .
you screwed me .
gibbons didn' t authorize this .
he' il hang us both out to dry .
agent shavers .
yeah ?
i' m going to give you a field promotion .
take over , finish the mop up .
you' re in charge .

i' m the man for the job !
i won' t let you down !

almost forgot the manual .
you' il need this .
hey , x. go kick some ass .
that thing must be going 80 mph !
how do we stop it ? !
we can' t !
the controls are on the bubble panel .
you see it ?
yeah .
the hard drive' s in there !
you got the manual .
see if shavers put in anything we could use .
he' s got very bad handwriting .
come on !
flame throwers , mini bombs , exploding hubcaps , rocket launchers !
this is a tank .
you can' t use any of it on ahab .
silent night only breaks down in deep water .
i' il have to get on it !
what ?
i' il have to get on it .
our surveillance puts ahab 22 minutes outside of prague .
we should evacuate the city .
22 minutes for 1 . 5 million people ?
call air support .
we may need to blow it out of the water .
lf we hit that thing  this city will die .
and the crisis will be contained !
one city' s better than 10 .
a blue gto is traveling parallel to ahab .
shit !
does this road go back to the river ?
come on !
check the gps !
yes , it does !
fifteen miles at the town of davle !
there' s got to be something here we could use .
harpoon gun , parachutes built into seats , ejectable roof .
it' s all useless !
how far are we ?
the river is just beyond the next village .
i' m going through !
use the rocket launcher !
twenty two !
hit it !
that was a flamethrower !
use the rockets !
it' s 32 !
i told you !
i told you he had bad handwriting !

shavers loaded this thing .
we' re missing something .
there are more weapons here on the back .
look .
