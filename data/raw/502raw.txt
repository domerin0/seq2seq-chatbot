i would like to suggest , emperor , that you reconsider your plan .
the scientists are comparing it to russian roulette .
what theories we have on phenomena like the maggot hole indicate a tendency for continually increasing disturbances .
so what else is new .
can we pass through there ?
our ships weren' t designed for twist pressures over one googol fluxoms .
so in other words , you don' t have a clue .
why' s everybody talk back all the time ?
try walking in my shoes !
it' s no cakewalk , managin ' the whole world by myself .
gotta admit , sometimes i think i' ve gotten in too deep .
this mess began 8 years ago .
my ship blew up and i was stuck in the past .
my remaining crew and i went native
' cos otherwise , we' d have changed the course of history .
the only good thing in the life of the man in the street was burgers .
with extra cheddar .
hullo .
i' m captain pirk , by the way .
oh .
i' m from the future .
look , i' ve got a ray gun .
hey , i can see it' s a water gun .
what ?
it' s a hand twinkler , stoopid !
right .
i got a communicator , too .
i' il call info .
he can prove i' m who i say .
don' t bother ...
this is a place for people to eat , not for you to play with yer balls .
look where you' re going , asshole .
keep away or i' il shoot !
look , a super soaker .
it' s a hand twinkler , you dumbass !
and i got a bag of whoopass for you !
ya gonna get your baggy ass whooped .
the batteries are shot .
oh thursday , no !
bobby' s grill .
pirk to dwarf .
captain !
it' s been a while .
yeah , well , info' s been going on about messing with the timeline .
me , i can' t wait to get away .
same here .
old earth much more boring than its barbarous reputation would suggest .
just a second , sir .
that' s three hot dogs and a sausage roll , to eat here ?
one minute ...
sorry , sir . these morons won' t let me have a moment' s rest .
and don' t throw up everywhere !
we' re closed !
listen , i' m tired of waiting .
we need to plan our next move .
meet me and info at the usual place .
hot dogs !
hot dogs !
right .
i' il call him just as soon as i can rid these dimwits !
lily livered kids !
i' il make hot dogs of your intestines !
the arrival of the vulgars shoulda been a new beginning for humanity .
when they happened along , they ended up with rock star jeff cochbrane .
it was a mistake , leaving ' em in the care of that drunkard idiot .
soon , the vulgars could care less about humanity or new beginnings .
good thing i had a backup plan .
but i couldn' t do it without dwarf and info' s help .
i hope you have a good reason .
we may be endangering the timeline .
yes , in fact i do .
take a look at this !
lesbian housewives getting busy ?
at this , i mean .
what an unexpected development .
the entire space program cancelled !
not like the history we know .
the antimaterial power breakthrough should have been announced today .
that' s why we have to do something .
we' il make the p fleet happen !
your proposal is in direct violation of the first directive !
if we don' t , the timeline' s history !
we' il have to have peace , universal language , tights for uniforms , and a defense against the korg !
as the only captain , i' m ordering that we' il ensure the founding of the p fleet , by any means necessary !
future technology in the hands of these people could spell disaster .
that' s why the world needs a strong leader .
someone like ... me !
i' m gonna be emperor .
one heavy cruiser should be enough to conquer this world .
everyone would be at our mercy .
unfortunately we do not have one .
and we cannot build one without an antimaterial powerplant .
but i know where we can get one .
gimme that phone .
cochbrane .
oh , it' s you ... hi .
listen , where' s the ship ?
what , the vulgar rocket ship ?
we sold it to some russian scientist type for top dollar .
what ?
who ?
vladimir something , i forget .
where' s this vladimir live then ?
chanistanya nuclear plant , i think .
who the hell gave you permission to sell the ship , you son of a bitch ?
well thanks the same , you ...
the junkie bastard sold the ship to the russians !
goddammit !
now what do we do ?
we' re off to russia , numbskull .
atomic research facility , chanistanya
luckily the missing vulgar ship was surprisingly quickly located .
it was the only thing on the planet that could let me build my flagship .
what' s ze problem ?
what ?
bloody western teknology !
vladimir !
ze reaktor is overheating !
ze kooling system is on ze fritz !
damnation !
and ze kontrol system is lokking up again .
sergey !
sergey !
where are you , sergey ?
what ?
you used to work at a nuklear plant ?
yeah , the chernobyl facility . why ?
kooling system problems , but that' s what you do best , right ?
go check out the reaktor chamber .
gee , thanks .
chernobyl . why' s zat sound familiar ?
chernobyl ...
chernobyl !
fukoooov !
piece of pie .
make damn sure you never touch the kooling system again , sergey !
yeah !
yes , sir , captain .
i thought it was the climate control for my quarters .
i was cold !
you' re now my prisoners !
do exactly what i say , or it' s whoopass time !
is it a revolution ?
yeah , you could say that .
at last !
ze soviet union will be reborn !
we will be free from ze yoke of kapitalism !
hooray !
what the hell ?
aren' t they gonna put up a fight ?
perhaps you should just play along .
i' m emperor pirk , and we' il build a new ship here in tachanya and with it , a brave new empire !
so that' s how it got started .
the nearby village had the space and the manpower to found the p fleet .
info got the flagship project to lead , i had better things to do .
i told ' em to be ready in 6 months , but they wasted years of my time !
i realized i had to be a charismatic leader , so the flab had to go .
it was hard work , but my determination paid off .
the electroforce buttdoer !
order now , for only 5, 999 roubles !
several months later
took your sweet time , didn' t you ?
the negotiations with the russian president had also gone well .
my plan hinged on having a powerful ally .
ah , what an entrance .
a pleasure to meet you at last !
sure ...
i' ve got our contract here .
i' il just look this over ...
everything seems to be as agreed ...
i can' t be bothered to read it .
i' il just sign it .
igor , a pen !
we will make this world a better place !
the alliance with russia made it possible to begin war preparations .
soon , we had lots of gear and troops were being trained on schedule .
come on , come on !
no pain , no gain !
you' il never make real soldiers !
the moment of truth finally arrived .
with our forces ready to rumble , it was time to play our trump card : the flagship of the p fleet , the cpp kickstart .
lookin ' good !
tactical is still missing a chair !
now , we wouldn' t want your powerful thigh muscles to atrophy .
are we all set to go ?
yes , sir .
power level at 96 . 3 percent .
let' s go and conquer the world .
were there any questions ?
so you' re the famous emperor pirk ?
this is me , in all my glory .
right ...
let' s move !
i don' t think i' m in moscow anymore .
welcome aboard the cpp kickstart .
perhaps mr president would like to witness the capabilities my ship .
this is an honor !
first we' il pay the yanks a visit .
full twist , now !
what is it this time ?
russian workmanship at its finest !
due to impure antimaterial gas , we can only achieve twist factor two .
dwarf , target that piece of junk .
we' il see if the weapons work !
nyet !
one moment ! what are you ... ?
fire twinklers and light balls !
it wasn' t built by americans alone !
billions of roubles went into it !
relax , gramps . we' il build a newer and better one .
vlctoryto vlctory
the beginning of the 3rd millennium : poverty , famine , disease .
leaders spoke of freedom , but sent children to die in meaningless wars .
mother russia nurtured a new hero from the ranks of the oppressed .
side by side , emperor pirk and president ulyanov led the way .
the road was long , but working hard , we proved that nothing is impossible .
we were ready for humanity' s final battle .
our men sallied forth to liberate our oppressed northern brethren .
to arms , brothers !
together , the brave men of russia and the technology of tomorrow shook the old world to the core .
reactionaries were swept away before the cunning of emperor pirk .
their leaders , faced with certain defeat , deserted their cities .
but europe could no longer offer them sanctuary .
our victorious armies , headed for a better world , shook our enemies with the marching of a million feet .
soon , the stakes were driven to the heart of the old continent .
with europe liberated , the people of the world turned their attention to that old devil , the united states of america .
they filled the skies with death , and were undone by it .
we taught that monster of old the true meaning of freedom .
the time was right for a brave new empire : the p fleet was born .
what ?
what is it ?
get your hands off ! .
i' m your president !
get off ! .
you ... you snake , you tyrant .
we had an agreement , you traitor !
no , no !
don' t shoot !
nooo !
that' s how i became emperor of the world .
a fleet of warships was built with the combined resorts of the earth .
gotta be ready if some slime faces from outer space come callin ' !
really , i did all i could for mankind , but did anybody thank me ?
no , they just whined about famine and overpopulation and stuff .
what' s this racket ?
get off my lawn or i' il light ball your asses !
down with pirk !
down with pirk !
so i thought of a solution : expand to other planets .
only our primitive ships couldn' t go very far , and closer planets weren' t habitable .
we did try one or two , but without too much luck .
the cpp kalinka was a cheap bucket tasked to patrol the backwaters for a few years or until it rusted out .
the captain was just the man for the job .
i ... identify yourselves !
all non p fleet craft are to be destroyed on sight .
how odd ...
i scanned the ship right before the explosion .
it had one occupant ... human .
how did a one man craft get this far from earth ?
i dunno .
let' s call the emperor !
now what ?
we saw a ship in epsilon ouadrant .
huh ?
dunno who it was , we destroyed it !
are you shooting at our own guys ?
see you in court martial !
oww , shit !
who the hell hired you , anyway ?
you did !
but it wasn' t one of ours !
go tell info , i have soap in my eyes .
i could lose my sight , you know !
and who left the soap on the floor ?
now what ? !
we had a meeting at two o' clock .
didn' t it occur to you it might be two pm , wiseguy ?
your expression was ambiguous , sir .
riight ...
it' s about captain fukov' s report .
what about it ?
considering the possible vectors and size of the ship they encountered , the ship must have originated near the other end of the maggot hole .
yeah , yeah , get to the point .
there must be an unknown human civilization that built the ship .
considering our tough situation ...
... we can take over their planets !
i would have asked them for aid .
well it' s not your decision .
prepare the fleet for battle !
capt ...
captains of the p fleet . you have been assembled for a reason .
beyond this maggot hole , there' s a lot of very nice space .
we' il take it , by force , if need be !
you have your order papers .
i don' t have no papers !
fukov !
interrupt me again , and i' il have you scrubbing bulkheads again !
you' re sitting on top of' em .
all available ships will be used , so there' s no room for failure !
that' s why i' m leading the mission myself .
there goes our last hope for victory ...
we' re leaving tomorrow morning , at six o' clock .
any questions ?
meanwhile in a parallel universe ...
ambassador flush , welcome aboard the babel 1 3 .
yes
we weren' t expecting you for ...
yes
may i ask ?
yes
it' s nothing .
jonny !
sorry to interrupt .
i' ve got some bad news .
this is our chief of security , mikhail garybrandy .
look sharp , this is an important ...
what' re you going on about ?
lt kefir took a star flurry for a drunken joyride last night .
what ?
why didn' t you stop him ?
i was so dru ... dreadfully tired .
where' s kefir now ?
in the morning , i sent a patrol out .
this is all they found .
oh my god .
what ?
aliens have crystallized kefir !
jonny , this is a data crystal .
from kefir' s flight recorder .
crystallized kefir ...
scream my rank !
where did that ship come from ?
dunno .
but it sure is butt ugly .
could it mean ...
what ?
the prophecies of the minibar are coming true .
a great darkness will come , and we' re all going to die .
jonny , you' re scaring me .
the one to rule them all and in the darkness bind them " , i' ve read it .
now , let' s get back to reality , huh ?
an itching nose must be scratched .
there you have it , mikhail !
we have to trust the instincts that served our ancestors so well .
ivanovitsa , we need reinforcements .
call in all ships in the vicinity .
yes , sir .
i have a bad feeling about this .
this is where it happened .
let' s get cracking .
fukov , you go in first .
we do not know if a starship can survive entering that maggot hole .
that' s exactly why fukov is going first !
oh yeah ?
well thanks a lot !
message from the kalinka : all clear .
raise deflector plates and arm weapons .
we' re going after ' em !
dammit , it' s like sailing thru jello .
info , condensate , do something !
compensating by angling hindenburg stabilizers across the ion field .
the ouarton crystals should reach the correct frequency right ... now .
yeah . whatever .
sir , unidentified craft detected !
on the telly .
they disappeared .
but there ain' t no planets in all this red jello .
apparently , the ships activated some kind of local twist in space .
we can duplicate the energy burst , which should open a similar twist ...
stop yammering and just do it .
helm , take us after them !
that was the last of our reinforcements .
now , we can ...
hopgate opening , craft coming through .
how many ?
forty . type : unknown .
blast ...
if i' d only known when i accepted command of this station ...
i' d have done so with all the more zeal ! we' re here to keep the peace and even if it meant killing every sentient being in the galaxy , we ...
captain , this is hardly the time .
this is a question of principle .
it is my right to make speeches , and i swear that no one will deny me it .
not an enemy fleet , and especially not some embittered commander who likes to chew out garbage scow captains docking in handicap spaces !
is that clear ?
sir , we' re being hailed .
oh ... well , put it on the telly .
this is capt sherrypie of the babel 13 .
please identify yourselves .
they look just like people !
this is emperor pirk , supreme commander of the p fleet .
info , that' s a space station , right ?
is the planet habitable ?
not according to the scanners , sir .
shoulda known ...
we just came to say hello , since we happened to be close ... ... us and the fleet .
where are you guys from , anyway ?
this station is neutral territory .
we have visitors from minibar ,
kentucky , narc , and of course earth .
huh ?
we haven' t been here before ?
emperor , i assume we have arrived in a mirror dimension of our own world .
historical events may be different here , but some similarities exist .
so do you know where their earth is ?
in theory , yes , assuming that our star charts have the same stars .
another earth ...
we' il conquer that !
we' il secure this end of the maggot hole that tube can' t be too hard ...
emperor ! the line is still open .
i knew that .
son , you' re none too bright , and won' t be marrying into money either .
but you' re human , earth to earth and all that .
so show some spine and come out and stop being a shame on your old man .
tell me , can we beat them ?
given that we have deflector plates and they do not , it is possible ...
yes , or no ?
yes . ... mother earth needs you today !
bring us to light ball range and contact the rest of the fleet . ... so i came out and gave the blood sample .
now , earth needs me again ...
open fire at maximum range .
everyone pick targets and wait for my signal . ... and i know every man , woman and child on this station feels the same .
the only way you can conquer earth is over our dead bodies !
know that you shall pay dearly for every cubic inch of our space .
we will fight you with sticks and stones , or even with our bare hands .
the forces of darkness shall move no further !
and if it took a thousand ...
have some light balls .
fire . ... as a shining beacon in the night !
... in the face of beatniks from another dimension ...
what the hell !
close the blast doors !
activate the defense grid !
nice speech , sir .
amigo class destroyers have reached optimal firing range .
they' re to attack the heavier ships .
that' il show them we mean business .
fire !
saucer section penetrated !
serious damage to all decks !
what' s with my deflector plates ? !
fascinating !
our plates never even registered the penetrating energy .
skipper , the hull' s taen a paikin , an the whisky barrels teuk a hit .
dinnae scart yer breeks , tho .
gien some duct tape and twa oors ...
you got two minutes !
fall back !
all ships , cover me !
emperor , i just learned that we only have three light balls left .
i' m filing a formal complaint !
quit bitching and use twinklers .
the backgammon is being overpowered ... and we can' t last long , either .
the backgammon is being overpowered ... and we can' t last long , either .
damn , this doesn' t look good .
i' m afraid we only have one recourse .
you don' t mean
yes . we have to stall for time .
i' m giving a speech !
raise the enemy command ship !
wait ... the station is hailing us .
a recording of sherrypie begging for mercy would have propaganda value .
well receive it then if it' il shut you up .
babel 1 3 surrenders .
don' t shoot , we have over 250, 000 civilians here .
what do i care about your civilians ?
and why would i be interested in a chock full hunk o' junk of a station ?
why don' t you bring your crew over for some shore leave ?
you could also repair your fleet ...
our ships are fine .
and shore leave can wait until after we' ve taken your earth .
also , you could personally take ivanovitsa' s virginity !
what ?
well ... lemme consider this .
oh , and throw all your guns out the airlock .
it' s an obvious trap !
it' il be all right !
we' il take a couple sledfuls of security guards .
the crew must have some time off .
and these ships could use repairs .
figures .
ok , sherrypie .
we accept your terms .
babel 1 3 is now officially part of the p fleet , renamed ... ... the " praise of pirk' s greatness .
and no tricks , or you' re toast !
pirk out .
dwarf , order all able security guys to the sledbay .
you , and info will stay on the kickstart , just in case .
if they try anything funny , blast the crap outta ' em !
but wait till i' ve gotten off .
emperor' s blog , dunno what moondate .
the p fleet wiped the floor with these babel losers .
we' il secure a base here and then go on to conquer their earth .
the crew' il get some rest , and ... ... i figure i' il get some , too .
go get ' em, tiger !
... demanding landing clearance .
clearance granted in hangar 1 .
welcome to your station !
this is too goddamn easy .
tell me about it .
hey kid , is your insurance in order ?
why ?
i feel it in my bones , we won' t be coming back .
nah , it can' t be that bad .
oh yeah ?
last time it was supposed to be a cakewalk , my two buddies bought it .
and that japanese guy kamikaze , he' s never gonna walk again !
and then there was ... shut up !
you' re hurting the crew' s moray !
is everything ready ?
what the hell are you smirking at ?
sherrypie is so going to get it ...
let' s move !
where' s sherrypie ?
he couldn' t stand defeat .
he shot himself in the head , three times .
if you wish to see the body ...
well i don' t .
but you can show me around the station .
my station .
where would you like to start , sir ?
how about your bedroom , you know , sherrypie promised me something ...
yes , sir .
this is emperor pirk .
one half of all crews can come aboard on leave .
oh , and nobody disturb me for the next fift ... hour !
right , let' s go .
vlctory party
let' s get wasted !
am i your first ?
naah ...
i' ve had lots of women , after all , i am the emperor ... yeah !
our scanners should now be correctly calibrated to this dimension .
interesting ...
i' m picking up energy readings from beyond the hopgate .
i shall make some adjustments ...
wait a minute ... what' s that ?
nothing , just a screen saver .
sir , sir !
goddammit , it' s a trap !
very perceptive of you .
the excavator has arrived with our reinforcements .
evening , commander .
festerbester ...
we were taking this new flagship for a spin , and decided to lend a hand .
where' s captain giddyup ?
he was feeling unwell , and had to leave the ship under my command .
i never thought i' d say this , but it' s good to see you .
let' s kick those bastards out of this galaxy !
this is captain jonny k. sherrypie .
the rumors of my death are greatly exaggerated .
aww , crap .
starting immediately , we' re retaking our station from these oppressors .
men of babel , to arms !
defend that which is ours by right !
brown sector !
on the double !
to the zicala !
all p fleet personnel are under arrest under earth martial law .
they are not to be allowed to leave the station .
our reinforcements will deal with their fleet .
to all p fleet personnel who surrender without resistance ,
i promise a fair court martial and a swift execution .
there is a ship , registration zex 51 4 , parked aft of the station in a handicap space .
will the owner move it a. s. a. p.
activate the defense grid and open fire !
the dishonorable traitors !
i told them it' s a trap !
me kill you !
kill !
control yourself , apeman . the emperor and half our crews are still aboard .
at least we' il destroy their ships .
kickstart to fleet , aim light balls !
i believe i was placed in command .
kickstart to fleet : ignore the previous order .
aim light balls on attacking enemy ships and fire on my mark .
fleet reporting : practically all light balls expended .
in that case , approach to twinkler range at full shove power .
our losses should not exceed 68 . 4 per cent .
i guess it' s a passable day to die .
blast it , i' il handle this !
lt fubar !
don' t go !
it is my destiny .
hey , it' s war .
people get killed , you know .
emperor pirk !
order your men to lay down their arms .
i guarantee a fair court martial to all those who surrender .
the p fleet will never surrender !
and , i lost my communicator .
ivanovitsa , inform the enemy fleet that we' ve captured their emperor .
cannot comply , sir . that last hit disabled our communications systems .
darn .
so .
i' m no use to you anymore .
how about i' il just scoot off ?
weapons range attained !
fire at will .
when i joined the military , i swore to protect earth against any enemy .
i have faced starving martian insurgents and the fleets of minibar .
all this i have done to protect the unified earth , unified mankind ...
enough with the speeches !
bastard !
very well , if you can' t wait to die .
emperor pirk , i sentence you to death for your crimes against humanity .
you will be executed immediately , by five plasma pellets to the head .
don' t take it like that !
go ahead with your speech !
ready ... aim ...
zounds !
why weren' t those ceiling struts fastened properly ?
zucker ?
you shall be avenged !
all worked up over some security guy who died ...
run , boys !
i' il cover you !
let' s roast them !
my sled ...
going somewhere , emperor ?
blast these struts !
this station is a piece of crap !
no turbolift , nothing !
you can use the exercise !
why exercise when you can get one of these delivered to your home ?
stop hiding , you !
now what' s with this thing ?
oh jefferson ! the batteries are out !
let' s settle this like men one on one .
stop whining , you wuss !
get up !
this is for zucker !
so , emperor . the game' s over .
understand this , pirk .
war is war .
you and me , as soldiers , know this better than anyone .
but when you murdered my friend in cold blood , this became personal .
i' il see to it that you die slowly , and have time to regret everything .
didn' t anyone ever tell you your bootlaces are too long ?
my contact lenses !
found ' em !
security guards to the hangar !
coward !
enemy target destroyed .
moving on to next ...
imperial distress call
pirk to kickstart !
pirk to ...
sir , we do hear you .
oh good .
i' m in this sled .
come and get me asap . them cowards set me up !
you don' t say , sir .
they were no match for my cunning .
get over here and rescue me !
set a course for the emperor' s sled .
i' il just destroy this destroyer .
commander , it' s an imperial distress call .
we' re moving out .
i have him in my sights .
one second !
the p fleet is not the planet of the apes .
we obey a superior officer .
i' ve had it with you , binary brains !
whatever you may think , the vcr remote stop button doesn' t harm me .
now , perhaps we can go and help out the emperor .
hayday to fleet .
are your crews back from r& r yet ?
curses !
outflank the enemy .
i want the heavy destroyers taken out now !
oh thursday !
yeehaw !
all clear , sir !
what kept you guys ?
they almost got me !
we came as soon as we could , limited by the performance of cmdr dwarf .
wars aren' t won by avoiding battles .
enough with your sorry plingon proverbs .
status report !
we have lost 23 ships , and have 14 operational ships left .
enemy reinforcements are putting up a stiff fight .
additionally , our twinkle beams are powerless against their flagship .
what the hell ... are we armed with twinklers or flashlights ?
light balls seem to work better , but the kickstart only has nine left .
i know : let' s fire ' em all at once .
and dwarf , this is an important shot so i' m taking over .
sir , i really wouldn' t recommend it .
maybe the range is too much for you , but for me it' s a piece of pie .
computer , manual override of weapon systems .
this is child' s play .
goddammit .
dork .
i had it in my sights , didn' t i ? !
sir , have you ever heard of leading the target ?
lead ?
can' t these damn computers calculate it for me ?
when the target' s in the crosshairs , the shots should hit !
child' s play , indeed !
you couldn' t have hit it yourself .
you rotten ... take a shower , stinker !
plingon warriors do not take showers !
sir , a hit from that attack would have caused serious damage .
the enemy command ship may be a grave threat .
the best defense is a good offense .
do something about them ! ... target and lock on the kickstart ...
ready the main gun ...
heavy structural damage to starboard !
shut up and keep firing !
their main gun is locking on us .
well take evasionic action then .
evasionic action pirk 7 .
jefferson' s jellies !
retreat , fast !
power will be back in 40 seconds .
i' d like to know what whoever designed this weapon was thinking .
i estimate that the enemy flagship can fire again in 1 7 . 3 seconds .
hey , let' s hide behind the station .
they won' t dare shoot at us there .
finally .
and where is our friend the kickstart ?
unknown , sir . the blackout caused the targeting computer to reboot , so we lost lock on .
but i' il track them down again in no time .
captain' s blog : the kalinka suffered heavy damage to halludeck circuits , and we retreated for repairs .
most of the crew were on the halludeck having a vodka party , and now the door seems to be stuck .
lt. makarov , how are the repairs ?
it' il be open in 10 minutes , sir .
no hurry .
looks like the battle will go on for some time .
this is cold .
ouch !
holy shit .
hey , guys .
according to our scanners , the kalinka still has 20 light balls .
that russkie coward been holding back again ?
if we ask capt fukov to deliver his light balls to us , we can close in ...
and blast them to pieces !
only i might do the targeting this time .
like hell you will ! this is my show .
esteemed emperor , it seems you tore off your joy stick on that last try .
ok . you shoot , but you' d better hit .
open a channel to fukov !
hi there .
what' ve you done ?
not one hit , but your ship is in pieces .
we had some technical problems .
get the kalinka over here , load all your light balls on a sled , and ...
... bring them to the kickstart .
come again ?
you' re breaking up .
send the whole case .
and pack them well or they' il warm up in transit .
hokay ...
the enemy is pressing on our fleet .
should we withdraw to regroup ?
no .
have you located the kickstart yet ?
yes , sir .
it' s sitting next to the babel 13 .
but our ships ... ... are able to look after themselves .
we shall destroy the kickstart .
i sense these spineless worms only fight for fear of their emperor .
the loss of their flagship will crush their spirit and secure our victory .
the light ball loader is calling .
sir , the shipment from the kalinka just arrived from the sled bay .
high time , too .
what am i supposed to do with it ?
what do you think , pea brain ?
stuff ' em in the light ball tubes !
this is the light ball loader , what do i do with light balls ?
hide ' em under my bed ?
that' s the last time i ever recruit my crew from russia .
ready to execute the plan , sir .
get us into a firing position .
sir , the kickstart left the side of the babel 13 and is heading at us .
this is emperor pirk !
any last words before we blast you to bits ?
ah , the emperor . we meet at last .
i regret to say your pitiful attempt only makes me feel sorry for you .
we' il see who' s sorry after 20 light balls !
prepare the twist drive .
they are making this too easy ... but never look a gift horse in the mouth .
captain , if you would , please . ...
prepare the main gun ...
twist drive ...
now !
pirk' s cunning strikes again .
lightballs locked onto their bridge .
say onara , suckers .
fire !
the corps is momma and granny .
direct hits on bridge ! ... with light balls loaded with 1 2 oz . beer bottles .
fukooooov !
what ?
what ... was ... your big idea ... with these light balls ?
light balls ?
what light balls ?
i told you to send over your light balls you braindead commie mutant !
no , you asked for " light beer " .
enemy ship returning fire .
get outta the way !
too late .
massive damage taken !
one twist drive destroyed !
lost connections for twinkle banks
computer helpdesk went bankrupt !
halludeck going offline !
coffee o matic damaged beyond repair !
ne' er mind that , she' s gaun tae blow !
the twist core just breuk an thare' s antimaterial gas awgates .
well fix it !
return fire !
weapon systems are inoperable .
furthermore , our twist core will split in 3 . 6 minutes .
at least we' il take the bastard with us !
set collision course !
how pathetic .
our next shot will take them out .
captain ! ... ready the main gun ...
sir , somehow the beer seems to have corroded all control circuits .
the main gun is out of action .
fine then . we' il do it the hard way .
secondary guns , fire !
gimme all you got ! you can' t hurt me !
you are a good sport , but as you can see , you are finished .
well i have the last laugh .
and it' s on you and your silly leather gloves .
arrogant insect .
full speed ahead !
we have the mass advantage !
okay , fukov .
disengage the sucking beam , and break to the right .
sure , sir !
emperor , there' s a slight problem ...
you stupid moron !
26 seconds to impact .
fukooov !
you' re gonna get us all killed !
waitaminit !
what' s this ?
it' s ... it' s the spare stick !
spare stick ?
2 . 1 seconds to impact !
see you in reykjavik !
oh , crap .
the situation looks bad , sir .
the fleet is decimated and the enemy is setting up to attack the station .
erm , i take it that the defense grid has been activated ?
it would be , if there was anything left of it .
hi guys , how' s it hangin ' ?
are you drunk ?
no .
i' m absolutely wasted !
so you fell off the wagon again .
they don' t call me garybrandy for nothin ' .
but hey , who cares .
we' il soon all be dead , anyway .
there must be something we can do .
sure .
we can take them bastards with us .
the fusion reactor' s warming up nicely .
what ?
i disconnected the cooling system .
the fireworks should start in about
this is mutiny !
reconnect the system immediately !
wait !
mike may be right . what other options do we have ?
we will fight till the last !
we have nothing left to fight with !
no ! we have men , ppb' s , our fists !
when they come to take the station ..
my guess is that after the last time , pirk won' t try to take the station .
so all we gotta do is keep ' em close for a little while longer .
jonny , you need to relax a bit .
wanna drink ?
effin ' traitors . you are so toast .
babel 1 3 surrenders unconditionally .
dwarf , warm up the twinkle banks .
but don' t you think it' d be better to shoot from a closer range ?
beams traveling across all that space would waste a lot of energy .
good idea ! tell the fleet to move to point blank range and lock on .
it seems the station' s power plant is approaching critical mass .
what ?
they' re trying to pull a fast one again !
who would' ve thought .
gimme full twist !
it' s not working !
sir , we' re losing antimaterial gas , and can only use half shove power .
it' il have to do .
all power to shove engines !
oh , and inform the rest of the fleet .
sure , sir .
hello , carlo' s sex line .
we need to hurry , things are so hot .
sounds exciting , what do i do ?
the emperor says to pull out before it pops !
fukov , what' s taking so long ?
did you inform the fleet or what ?
yeah , captain carlo answered .
who' s carlo ?
critical mass in 38 seconds .
into the jello hole , and fast !
our fearless leader is running away .
all ships , follow the emperor .
the enemy fleet is withdrawing !
we made it !
garybrandy , shut down the reactor immediately !
i' m almost there !
emergency reactor shutdown
oh peanuts !
where the hell is the rest of my fleet ?
fukov , didn' t you reach them ?
hurry up !
alright .
great job .
you can' t win every time , sir .
and who asked you ?
info , where the hell are we , anyway ?
one moment .
i' m recalibrating our scanners for our dimension .
what the hell ?
this end of the maggot hole must have shifted in time space .
avoid that planet !
insufficient energy for shove power .
beam us onto the planet !
there' s only enough energy to transfer three people .
info , dwarf , get ready to beam down !
not to worry !
it' il be all right .
ok , info .
how about letting us know where the hell we are ?
hawaii , on earth .
so where are all the surfers and hula hula dancers , smart guy ?
some 1 1, 000 years in the future .
what ?
i assume the maggot hole put us on earth , during the ice age .
the ice age ?
now what' re we gonna do ?
how about shooting ourselves before the twinklers freeze ?
in a low power mode , i believe i can make it until the 21st century , and prevent the fateful invasion campaign from taking place .
so that none of this ever happened ?
then i' il be saved !
hm .
in a way . yes .
