calma nao queremos fazer mais estragos
alpha team , qual a vossa situaao ?
regulator nominal .
stand by .
we' re looking at another 30 to 45 minutes .
pressure levels holding steady at seven niner zero , p . s . i .
that' s what i wanted to hear .
okay , guys .
conditions are green .
we' re go on regulator assembly .
roger that , topside .
we' il snap her together nice and quick .
commence additional stage hookup .
retention 20 % .
ease her up gently , fellas .
make sure the manifold seal is nice and tight .
integrity looks solid .
checking for stress points .
increasing tension by 3 . 5 .
we' re four hours behind !
don' t worry .
we' il make up the lost time .
isn' t boarder done with that cable patch yet ?
he' s still working on it .
keep in mind , it took six hours just to compress him for that depth .
and another two to get him on site .
see if we can' t get him to pick up the pace .
what' s his current position ?
1, 540 feet down , and 100 yards from the edge of the trench .
that' s a five mile drop off .
so remind him not to do any sightseeing .
deep calm , this is bountress , over .
deep calm ?
dave porter , are you down there ?
copy , bountress .
how' s it going ?
how do you think ?
i' m freezing my nuts off .
the super wants me to remind you that you' re not getting paid by the hour .
tell him he' s welcome to come down and give me a hand .
i' il let him know .
slap on that band aid as quick as you can .
bountress , over .
what the ?
i' ve got a contact .
down that deep ?
impossible .
shouldn' t be anything big enough to register .
something is there , 200 yards southeast of porter' s position and closing .
get him back on the horn .
porter , this is bountress .
come in .
repeat , this is bountress .
100 yards .
75 !
porter , come in !
porter , where the hell are you ?
go ahead , bountress .
you' ve got an unknown
approaching from southeast .
bountress , you' re breaking up .
something' s coming right at you !
say again .
30 yards !
20 .
get him out of there !
look , damn it !
he' s right beside you !
porter .

mi vida loca , amigo .
luis pays us to patrol the beach .
some guy at the harbor told me about this dive spot
that' s crawling with lobsters .
sounds good .
it' s south of banderas point .
oh no .
that' s way out of our patrol zone .
you' il get us in trouble , again .
don' t worry about it .
again .
i said , don' t worry about it .
we' il do it after our shift .
no one' s going to find out .
trust me .
trust you ?
why do i let you talk me into things like this ?
' cause you' re my bitch .
you wish .
i got you !
oh , i got you !
don' t try to reel him in all at once .
let him tire himself out .
i got him !
i got him !
what' s it gonna take ?
depends .
once i saw a marlin fight for five hours !
five hours ?
oh !
come on , you sucker !
oh , what happened ?
the line must have broken .
reel it in !
i got something .
here it is , seor .
30 years !
man  no one will know .
you just gotta learn to trust me .
i know where the best lobsters are .
what if  stop nagging .
you' re like an old woman .
i have to stay here and work .
i don' t want to get fired .
i don' t think it' s a good idea .
just relax .
i' il be back .
oh , man !
10 minutes .
and i' il bring you up a five pounder .
okay , you better .
you better .
i will .
c' mon , dive .
vmonos !
vmonos , amigo !
hasta luego !
what were you doing down there ?
getting some dinner .
that' s a high powered communications cable !
it' s not something to screw around with !
i don' t think it' s me you' ve got to worry about .
what' s that ?
a shark' s tooth .
i pried it from the underwater cable .
we' il take it from here .
just be more careful in the future , okay ?
okay .
no one' s gonna know , huh ?
we' re gonna hear about this .
ruiz is not going to know .
he won' t find out .
cuado .
oh , jeez .
sorry , ms. stone .
good evening , todd .
working late again ?
as usual .
you' ve been running around non stop , all day .
why don' t you take a break ?
i have so much to do .
i got to catalog all this stuff and get it down to the prep area .
bonn has been waiting 65 million years .
i think she can wait a half hour while you grab a sandwich .
no thanks .
you' re always too kind .
i' il see you tomorrow .
bye .
mystery shark ?
oh my god !
right , mr. ruiz .
yes , make it happen .
morning , mr. ruiz .
you wanted to see me ?
thanks for coming .
this is jeff tolley , ceo at apex communications .
ben here is one of the resort' s patrol guys .
why don' t you sit down ?
sure .
thank you .
mr. tolley has a lot of guests staying here .
really ?
we' re having a celebration on the launch
of our new trans pacific cable .
i heard about that .
the harbor master says you' re bringing in a cruise liner .
well , it' s not quite that big .
some of seor tolley' s people say that you were diving near that cable yesterday ?
yeah , i was .
but i wasn' t messing with it , if that' s what you mean .
they said that ... it seems something bit through the protective covering and damaged some of the fiber optics .
that' s right .
i found a shark tooth in the cable .
i' m hoping this is a random incident .
last month , we had to bury 50 miles of cable near japan just because a cargo ship snagged it with its anchor .
i' d hate to do that again here .
no , the shark was probably just curious and bit the cable just to see what it was .
sharks are always biting things .
i wouldn' t worry about it .
thanks for the reassurance .
no problem .
ben , let me walk you out .
sure .
nice to meet you .
pleasure .
i hired you to keep the beaches safe and protect the guests .
so from now on you will keep to your assigned patrol area .
am i clear ?
yes , sir .
uh huh .
come on .
andale , come on !
come on , mi amor .
baby , don' t go so far out .
por qu ?
you don' t know what' s out there .
are you afraid that something is going to swim up and bite your culo ?
it' s just a sand tiger shark .
pretty ugly , but harmless unless you' re a fish about that big .
i heard it scared that girl so bad , she ran all the way up the street buck naked .
almost caused an accident .
ramirez will think twice about bringing a girl to this spot .
so , what do we do with the shark ?
get someone with a truck to cart it back to the dock .
i' m sure some of the fishermen will chop it up and use it for bait .
you got it .
cool .
do you know where i can find ben carpenter ?
yes , he' s over there .
hey , thanks .
i' m looking for ben carpenter .
that would be me .
i stopped by your office and they said
i might be able to catch you down here .
well , you caught me .
hi , i' m cat stone .
i' m a marine biologist from the sand diego aquarium .
i saw your message on the internet .
well , that was fast .
it must be something important for you to come here for a tooth .
oh , it' s a quick flight and i enjoy the change of scenery .
besides , if your tooth is what i think it is ,
it' il be worth the trip .
then i won' t keep you in suspense .
oh , great !
so what' s so special about it ?
i checked online but couldn' t find a shark that' d match it .
we think it' s a subspecies of the mako shark .
very rare and extremely nomadic .
where did you say you found this ?
i pried it from an underwater cable about five miles offshore .
could i get the exact location ?
sure .
great .
you know , it' s a pretty big tooth .
how dangerous is this shark ?
no more than the regular mako .
i' m just concerned about our beaches .
if there' s a threat , i' d really like to know .
these sharks always stay out in the open ocean .
i know our aquarium would love to buy this tooth from you .
keep it .
think of it as my contribution to science .
thanks .
i appreciate that .
so , now that you have your tooth , is it right back up to san diego ?
no , i' il hang out for a couple of days and see if it might still be in the area .
i' il let you know if i find anything .
okay .
no flirting over there .
we have work to do .
looks like you gotta go .
yeah ...
i' il see you around .
it was nice meeting you .
nice to meet you , too .
you know , you' re dead meat .
anything else ?
no , thank you .
hello ?
hey .
it' s cat .
what' s going on ?
i just saw this tooth .
it' s genuine .
as in the real mccoy .
no .
get those video guys down here as fast as you can .
i want to document all of this before i take it public .
right .
and keep it quiet .
i' il send somebody down .
i owe you one .
okay .
see ya .
adnde vas ?
oh shit !
do you want to answer it ?
not really .
what the hell' s going on ?
it' s the first power grid .
i was running a tracer , checking the line resistance
and we lost it .
you overloaded the line ?
no , sir .
it was well below capacity .
one minute it was fine , and the next , we shorted out .
fuck !
that' s all i need .
call chuck rampart .
tell him to go out and check the cable .
in the meantime , i want you code monkeys to figure out a way to make the backup system work properly .
that' s what i pay you for .
fuck !
tolley isn' t happy ?
assholes are never happy .
hey .
here there , amigo .
you guys off in search of atlantis ?
i wish .
i got another problem with the fiber line .
trouble in a junction box 10 miles out , so ... we' il take her out for a look , report back what we find .
i saw a break in the cable off the coast , two days ago .
a shark bit through the casing .
really ?
man , they never tell me anything .
so , chuck , when will you let me pilot her ?
you got to pass my test on submersibles first .
don' t you think i' m too old for a driver' s test ?
maybe .
but a jeep doesn' t implode when you drive it wrong .
right .
take it easy , guys .
okay ?
adis .
adis , amigos .
you' il actually let him drive the sub ?
kid' s got damn good instincts .
make a hell of a submariner someday .
only if he listens to you , right ?
of course .
i love mexico .
great place to be shooting .
not a bad way to make a living .
i' m all for it .
look over there , huh ?
let' s get shooting .
all right .
let' s do it .
whoa !
get the cameras .
i' il check out the boat .
yes , ma' am .
don' t think i don' t know you' re checking out my ass , friedman .
who , me ?
aw , come on .
ohh , i like her .
davis , you like anything with a pair of tits .
that' s true .
it is .
but you' re the ass man .
remember ?
and you' d do anything for that ass .
fuckin ' a right , man .
come on !
nice .
playing with your toys ?
toys are actually what it' s all about .
you see , this here happens to be an underwater lipstick camera .
looks pretty small to me .
well , it' s really not the size that matters .
right , buddy ?
should be one hell of a pov shot if we get in close enough and stick a shark .
you' re going to get close all right .
get as much footage as you can get .
we' re pulling up to the location where they found that tooth .
guess what , boys ?
you start chumming .
oh , man !
this really stinks .
all right , sharky .
come and get it .
what the hell ?
holy cow !
is that it ?
looks about the right size .
get the cameras !
all right , baby .
come and get it !
you getting it ?
i need to get lower .
i' il get you there , man .
all right , bro ' .
come on .
here we go .
you' re hooked , man .
yeah , all right .
watch out .
coming through .
here it comes !
un fucking believable !
did you get it ?
yeah .
animal planet , eat your heart out .
yes !
yes !
look out !
shit !
what are you doing ?
making sure .
yeah !
that' s our baby .
we gotta tag it .
you got it , cat !
you bet your balls .
come on , baby !
the tag' s working .
you guys , take a look at this .
whew !
man , she' s going deep .
just keep it rolling .
holy fucking shit .
we got this baby .
yeah !
we got it !
she' s happy !
good boy !
come on .
thattaboy .
come on over here .
here we go !
thattaboy !
good catch !
come on , bring it here .
good boy !
come on .
oh , go get it , dirty !
come on !
go !
go !
jeez !
stupid dog !
i don' t know why i bring you .
well , here !
catch it !
get it , boy !
get it !
wow , this is as surprise .
late night social call ?
resort security matter .
sounds official .
there' s been a shark attack .
come in .
excuse the mess .
i' ve been working .
i can see that .
and ... trying to quit smoking .
how' s it going ?
terrible .
so tell me what happened .
it' s serious .
we found a guy' s leg near a beach where he was playing frisbee with his dog .
oh my god .
cataline stone .
paleontologist ?
san diego natural history museum .
so i guess this means you' re not a marine biologist .
you lied to me ?
i had to .
why ?
this shark isn' t a rare species .
it' s supposed to be extinct .
megalodon ancestor to the great white shark .
it can grow in excess of 75 feet long ...
jesus ! with a 10 foot wide bite .
one of these things is swimming off my coast ?
no .
you have a 15 feet long baby swimming off your coast .
but it' s a damn dinosaur .
how did it get here ?
that' s what i' m trying to find out .
you should have told me the truth .
like you would have believed me .
that' s not the point !
you knew what it was .
you had a responsibility .
i didn' t know the shark would be a danger .
tell that to the family of the man who' s dead .
this thing is obviously dangerous .
we' ve got to get rid of it .
you can' t just kill it .
watch me .
do you know what we can learn from this ?
it' s like finding a tyrannosaurus rex in your backyard .
cat , i don' t see that as being a good thing .
ben , wait !
i know what you' re going to ask , so don' t even say it .
fine .
how will you find it ?
i' il find it .
you' il have a hard time without this .
you tagged it ?
yes , i did .
i can come within 10 meters of that shark .
close enough to bite you .
i could confiscate that thing .
you could try .
or you could come work on my boat .
i don' t like playing games .
neither do i.
so what do you say we both get what we want ?
i can study the shark and you can protect your beaches .
beats cruising around in circles all day .
lo siento .
all right .
but at the first sign of trouble , i' m taking it out .
fair enough .
smart ass !
well , excuse me !
how can this shark still be alive after all this time ?
some scientists believe the megalodon survived the extinction of the dinosaurs and the ice age by living in deep water trenches .
and no one' s seen one after all this time ?
hey , guys , check this out .
i was going through yesterday' s footage .
take a look at this .
wait , you put a camera on the shark ?
you gotta love the sharkcam , man .
is that the cable where you found the tooth ?
yeah , that' s the apex cable .
hey , guys !
we' re getting a signal .
west 18 .
that' s about a half mile due northeast .
okay .
get the cameras ready , boys .
you got it !
let' s go .
uh , it' s it' s headed due east .
east .
due east .
jesus , it' s headed for the resort .
full throttle , now !
there it is !
jimmy , this is ben .
what is it ?
a shark' s heading for the shore .
get everyone out of the water , now !
shark !
shark !
everybody out of the water !
shark !
shark !
everybody out of the water !
out of the water , everybody !
shark !
shark !
everybody out of the water !
shark !
shark !
everybody out of the water !
everybody ... out !
faster !
go !
faster !
put the gun down !
what are you doing ?
i had it in my sight .
you did it !
he' s heading back out to sea .
problem solved .
no one got hurt .
we were lucky !
we were very lucky .
it' s fast .
what' s our speed ?
we' re barely keeping pace at 20 knots .
oh no !
faster .
it' s headed for that boat .
all right , bro ' !
muy bien !
yes , sir !
guys !
oh shit , it' s gonna ram them !
shark !
pull in !
shark !
shark !
guys !
hey !
move !
move !
hola !
como ests ?
hey !
move the boat !
move !
oh , shit !
go !
we' re not going to make it !
shit !
aydame !
pedro !
no !
the shark' s dragging her out to sea !
pull over !
this guy needs medical attention !
gimme a hand here .
wait !
help me get him in the boat .
help me , please !
hurry !
come on , ben !
hurry , ben !
hurry !
give me the wheel .
we have to save her .
hang on !
easy .
watch your head .
help !
help me !
no , no .
she' s going down !
oh my god !
oh my god !
hang on !
go down and help her !
help me !
help me !
come here !
hold on to my hand !
hold on .
hold on .
hold on .
hold on to me !
get her in !
we' re damn lucky .
we' re indemnified against legal action .
you' re talking about legal action when two people have been killed .
you knew about this jurassic shark and didn' t tell me .
i thought i could handle it !
you thought wrong !
i can kill the shark .
but we need to close the beaches .
people pay a lot of money to come down here and they expect to use everything including the beaches !
you can not let people swim in the water when there' s a shark out there !
okay , let me handle the beaches .
i' il come up with something .
but kill this thing quickly and quietly .
understood .
hey ... it' s okay .
no , it' s not okay .
i' ve studied fossils my whole life .
nothing but theories and guesses ...
this was my one chance to prove that i was right .
look what happened .
all those people are dead .
and it' s all my fault .
don' t blame yourself .
how could i be so blind ?
did you see that girl ?
she was so scared .
and i had seconds and i could have saved her life .
cat , what' s done is done .
there' s nothing we can do .
what we have to do now is stop anyone else from getting hurt .
i was looking at the video of the shark hugging the cable .
do you have any idea why it' s attracted to it ?
it could be electromagnetic or visual stimuli .
what' s running through that cable ?
it' s fiber optics .
i don' t know the specifics .
but i do have a friend who' s working on the project .
prehistoric , huh ?
that' s right .
prehistoric .
damndest thing i ever heard .
could the fiber be emitting something ?
low level electrical field .
not enough to harm anything .
but maybe enough to attract something .
in the ' 80s , at& t had problems with sharks biting though their fiber cables .
their cable installation was too thin .
electricity bleeding through the water .
the same could be happening here .
let me show you something .
this section of cable here in mexico connects to north america , south america , then 10 miles south , branches off to australia and japan .
the whole system' s set to go online in ... two days .
it looks like the cable goes near several deep water trenches .
yeah .
i lost a good buddy in an accident ... right about here .
near the challenger deep trench .
yeah , i' m sorry about that .
we know the meg' s attracted to the cable .
and with it running this close to the trenches , it could have drawn it out of the deep blue sea and lead it here .
that cable goes to full power , there is no telling how many of these megs we' il have on our hands .
we can' t let that system go online .
guys ... you' il have a hard time convincing tolley to delay a billion dollar project over ... what , some sharks and a hunch ?
yeah , he' s right .
we don' t have enough proof .
and we have to deal with the meg that' s out there now .
all right .
i' il check apex' s computer files , see what i can find .
do you have access ?
i will when i' m done hacking .
you know what ?
we' il need all the help we can get .
let' s go .
hey .
hey .
you guys take that ?
yeah .
yo , easy , easy , easy .
now ... are you sure this will kill it ?
if you want , i can test it out on freidman first .
i heard that .
smart ass .
is everything stowed ?
everything' s stowed .
let' s roll .
come on , baby .
come on .
here' s your password .
power bleed through .
you knew it was leaking .
what else are you hiding , tolley ?
son of a bitch !
the pacific horizon is prepared for tomorrow .
what' s the final head count ?
46 guests .
46 investors !
you don' t throw $100, 000 on a party cruise if they' re just guests .
yes , sir .
it' il be first class all the way .
you fucking knew !
security , get in here !
you knew , and you didn' t warn them ?
i don' t know what you' re talking about .
bullshit !
it' s all right here .
the diving accidents .
seven men dead !
including my friend .
you knew it was dangerous and you let them dive .
they knew it was risky .
some things weren' t accounted for .
bull fucking shit !
you knew something was happening !
and you covered it up !
you' re finished , tolley .
when the press gets a hold of you , they' il rip you an new asshole .
go tell your story .
who would believe you , a disgruntled employee with stolen confidential documents ?
my lawyers will have a field day with you .
they are the real sharks .
this isn' t over yet , tolley !
not by a long shot !
get him out of here !
esai , this is ben .
are you there ?
yeah , go ahead , ben .
nothing on our end , so far .
where are you at ?
i' m about five miles south of peridor .
i haven' t seen a thing .
maybe your shark skipped out .
i doubt it .
let me know if you see anything .
okay .
okay , okay .
west of our position about one mile .
all right , i' m on it .
esai , we found it .
we' re two miles northwest of the resort jetty .
i' m on my way .
10 4 .
cat , take this .
let' s get this going .
come on , you mother .
come to papa .
he' s gone under .
slow down .
jesus !
son of a bitch !
hold on !
yes !
got it .
son of a bitch !
davis , you okay ?
davis ?
i' il get my shotgun .
davis , come on .
come on , don' t do this .
davis !
come on , davis !
davis , come on !
help !
help me !
what ?
cat !
cat !
cat !
don' t move !
stay where you are !
die , god damn it !
die !
die !
son of a bitch !
die !
die !
you' re extinct , fucker !
are you guys okay ?
yeah .
davis , you all right ?
yeah .
oh , shit !
hey !
esai !
esai , we' re taking on water !
i' il be right there .
esai !
over here !
hey , over here !
help me !
holy fucking shit !
oh my god !
shit !
get up on top !
use your feet .
they' re over there !
no !
oh my god !
oh , shit !
what was that ?
look at that .
look at the tooth .
look at the size of that .
this is our proof .
i' il hold onto it .
shit !
hey !
don' t fall .
hey !
hurry !
give me your hand .
just take it easy .
hold on !
don' t let go .
get us out of here !
don' t let go !
come on !
come on !
you got it .
climb .
you okay , ben ?
yeah .
what the hell was that ?
you don' t want to know .
esai is dead and so are two other people !
what are you talking about ?
another megalodon killed them !
another one ?
you said you' d take care of it .
we killed it .
but its mother' s huge !
how big ?
larger than a greyhound bus .
bullshit !
look .
that' s what you' re dealing with .
you can' t keep this quiet .
we have got a 60 foot shark swimming off our coast that' s not going to go away .
we have to tell the authorities !
and tell the world we' ve got a dinosaur swimming off our beaches ?
you won' t blow the whistle ?
no .
fine .
then i will .
what happened ?
i just quit .
are you serious ?
yeah , i' m serious .
hector gave me the news .
you guys all right ?
we' re okay .
apex knew about the megalodons .
tolley turned a blind eye and counted his money .
we' ve got bigger problems .
you got that right .
i just went to the police but ... they don' t have the resources to help out .
what about the navy ?
i tried .
but navy won' t violate 12 mile limit .
i called the coast guard .
they can get a cutter down .
when ?
not until the end of next week .
that' s not quick enough .
so what do we do ?
we handle it ourselves .
i know where we can get explosives .
no questions asked .
we' il use the minisub , plant the charges , blow the cable at the junction box .
that' il prevent apex from turning on the system .
but we still have to deal with the meg .
we know it' s attracted to electricity .
let' s use it to our advantage .
i could string together a series of high voltage batteries .
that' il be enough to bring him to us .
and how do we kill it ?
we don' t want to wound it and have it swim back out to sea .
we want something that will not miss it .
i got something you ought to see .
the mark 44 torpedo .
taken out of service 15 years ago .
travels at 55 knots .
has a range of 10 miles .
where did you get that thing ?
the last sub i was on was decommissioned .
lot of hardware .
it' s better here than in a scrap heap .
does it work ?
it' il blow a hole clear through the hull of a battleship .
what about a shark ?
abso fuckin lutely .
okay , so the torpedo' s hooked up and armed .
are we ready ?
the mark 44 torpedo launch system' s nominal , but there' s a wrinkle .
it wasn' t designed for a biological target .
it needs something mechanical ... or electrical .
we need to tag the meg with this .
it' il send out a signal to the torpedo .
but somebody has to get close to the shark .
not necessarily .
where' d you learn to use a crossbow ?
i did a little deer hunting in my day .
all right , you two ... get some sleep .
yes , sir .
we' il meet back here at 8 : 00 a . m .

but i' m really wired .
shall i take you home and eat your pussy ?
okay .
the sardines are in the can .
copy that .
we' il shadow you from above .
you two be careful down there yeah , we' il be fine .
okay .
let' s get this circus underway .
all right , talk to me .
the harbor master has barred any boats from leaving the bay .
the fine is $5, 000 .
fine , pay it .
you know how much is riding on this today , how much money is standing on that boat right now .
that' s my future and yours .
it' il be fine .
it better be .
don' t worry .
a friend of mine here has brought us a little insurance .
just in case that shark shows up .
good .
let' s go .
all right .
we' re closing in .
getting close .
copy that .
what was that ?
clear air turbulence .
it happens when you fly this low .
you' il get used to it .
not likely .
okay , ben .
it' s all yours .
okay , we' re hooked on .
back away .
nice and easy .
piece of cake , right ?

ladies and gentlemen , if i could have your attention for a moment ?
i would like to thank all of you for coming on ... what i' m sure will be a landmark day for apex communications .
today ... we begin official use ... of a new generation of communication technology .
okay .
we' re clear by now .
you want the honors ?
okay , porter .
this is for you .
that cable is history .
dude , we just lost the main junction box .
well , switch to the backup router .
i can' t .
there' s nothing there .
the whole line' s completely dead .
should we call tolley ?
not unless you want to make the call .
take a look at that .
we' ve got a problem .
go ahead .
there' s a yacht out on the water .
the harbor master was supposed
to bar all traffic .
somebody didn' t listen .
within the next two years , we plan to build an entire network of fiber optic cables ... spanning the globe and bringing the world together as never before .
ladies and gentlemen ,
i propose a toast : to the future of apex .
hear , hear !
cheers .

it' s upstairs .
mayday !
mayday !
this is the pacific horizon .
we' ve been struck and the controls are not responding .
mayday !
what' s going on ?
the shark is attacking the ship .
drop the box ... and try to lure the shark away so you can tag it .
we' re getting there .
copy that .
i' m dropping the box .
let' s go .
hold it steady .
hold it steady .
son of a bitch !
