in the " new york herald ...
november 26 , year 1911 ... there is an account of the hanging of three men .
they died for the murder of sir edmund william godfrey ... husband , father , pharmacist ... and all around gentleman resident ... of greenberry hill , london .
he was murdered by three vagrants ... whose motive was simple robbery .
they were identified as ...
joseph green ...
stanley berry ... and daniel hill .
green , berry , hill .
and i would like to think this was only a matter of chance .
as reported in the " reno gazette ...
june of 1983 ... there is the story of a fire ... the water that it took to contain the fire ... and a scuba diver named delmer darion .
employee of the nugget hotel and casino , reno , nevada ... engaged as a blackjack dealer .
well liked and well regarded ... as a physical , recreational , and sporting sort ...
delmer' s true passion was for the lake .
as reported by the coroner , delmer died of a heart attack ... somewhere between the lake and the tree ... but most curious side note ... is the suicide the next day of craig hansen ... volunteer firefighter , estranged father of four ... and a poor tendency to drink .
mr. hansen was the pilot of the plane that accidentally ...
lifted delmer darion out of the water .
added to this , mr. hansen' s tortured life ... met before with delmer darion just two nights previous .
all i need is a two .
all you need is a deuce .
all right .
that is an eight .
glad you like my work .
moment of truth .
the weight of the guilt ... and the measure of coincidence so large ...
craig hansen took his life .
and i am trying to think ... this was all only a matter of chance .
the tale told at a 1961 awards dinner ... for the american association of forensic science ... by dr. john harper , president of the association ... began with a simple suicide attempt .
seventeen year old sydney barringer ... in the city of los angeles on march 23 , 1958 .
the coroner ruled that the unsuccessful suicide ... had suddenly become a successful homicide .
to explain the suicide was confirmed by a note ... in the right hip pocket of sydney barringer .
at the same time young sydney stood on the ledge ... an argument swelled three stories below .
the neighbors heard , as they usually did ... the arguing of the tenants ... and it was not uncommon for them ... to threaten each other with a shotgun ... or one of the many handguns kept in the house .
i' m going to put you down !
and when the shotgun accidentally went off ...
you asshole !
sydney just happened to pass .
what ?
shut the fuck up !
added to this , the tenants turned out to be ...
fay and arthur barringer ...
sydney' s mother and father .
when confronted with the charge ... which took some figuring out for the officers on the scene ...
fay barringer swore she did not know the gun was loaded .
she always threatens me with it , but i don' t keep it loaded .
and you didn' t load the gun ?
why would i load the gun ?
a young boy who lived in the building ... sometimes a visitor and friend to sydney barringer ... said that he had seen , six days prior ... the loading of the shotgun .
ricky , come here a minute .
it seems that all the arguing and fighting ... and violence was far too much for sydney barringer ... and knowing his mother and father' s tendency to fight ... he decided to do something .
he said he wanted them to kill each other ... and all they wanted to do was to kill each other ... and he would help them do that if that' s what they wanted .
sydney barringer jumps from the ninth floor rooftop .
his parents argue three stories below .
her accidental shotgun blast hits sydney in the stomach ... as he passes the arguing sixth floor window .
he is killed instantly , but continues to fall ... only to find , five stories below ... a safety net installed three days prior ... for a set of window washers that would' ve broken his fall ... and saved his life if not for the hole in his stomach .
so fay barringer was charged with the murder of her son ... and sydney barringer noted as an accomplice in his own death .
and it is in the humble opinion of this narrator ... that this is not just " something that happened .
this cannot be " one of those things .
this , please , cannot be that .
and for what i would like to say , i can' t .
this was not just a matter of chance .
these strange things happen all the time .
in this big game that we play , life ... it' s not what you hope for or deserve ... it' s what you take .
i' m frank t. j. mackey , a master of the muffin ... and author of the " seduce and destroy " system ... now available to you on audio and video cassette .

i got a call to this apartment , report of a disturbance .

i got a call of a disturbance .

ma' am , you want to test me ?

you push me far enough , i will take you to jail .
now calm yourself down .
i am calm !

you are not calm .
you' re screaming at me .
do you understand ?
i got a call of a disturbance , and i' m checking it out .
that is what i' m going to do .
are you alone in here ?
i ain' t got to answer you .
no , you don' t , but i' m going to ask you one more time .
are you alone in here ?
what does it look like ?
there' s no one else in here ?
you in here .
that' s true , but is there anyone else ... besides me and you in this house ?
no .
i said that already .
are you lying to me ?
i live by myself .
that might be true , but the question i' m asking you ...
is there anyone else in this house right now ?
what is your name ?
marcie .
marcie , i' m going to need you to take a seat here .
i prefer to stand up .
i' m not asking .
i didn' t even do nothing !
move , ma' am .
like i was saying , i' m here to check on a disturbance .
some of your neighbors heard screaming and a loud crash .
i don' t even know no loud crash .
what was that ?
i didn' t hear nothing .
sit on the couch .
i ain' t got to do a goddamn thing .
what' s this bullshit ?
do not do this .
do not slap me , ma' am .
this is bullshit !
for what ?
huh ?
tell me for what !
i asked you to sit on the couch , ma' am .
this is bullshit .
fucking bullshit .
15 l 27 , i' m going to need backup .
what the fuck is this ?
it' s bullshit , motherfucker !
stay right there , marcie .
fucking bullshit , and you know it !
stay there , marcie .
don' t go in my bedroom !
this is bullshit , motherfucker !
don' t go down the hallway !
don' t go down my motherfucking hallway !
lapd !
don' t go in my goddamn bedroom !
come out now with your hands up !
what' d i tell you ?
ain' t nobody in there !
where the fuck you going , motherfucker ?
don' t go in my goddamn bedroom !
stay out of my motherfucking closet !
what' d i tell you ?
this is the police !
if anyone is in this closet , come out now with your hands up .
marcie , do not drag that couch any further !
don' t do this , man !
there' s nobody in my motherfucking closet !
if i have to open this closet , you will get shot !
come back here , motherfucker !
what can' t you goddamn fucking talk to me ?
there' s nobody in there !
i told you !
marcie , quiet down !
this don' t make no fucking sense !
this don' t make no goddamn sense !
this is bullshit , motherfucker !
why can' t you talk to me ?
what the hell is this , marcie ?
that ain' t mine .
he' s fucking dying as we' re sitting here .
there' s not a fucking ...
jesus , how can you tell me to calm down ?
i can help you through this the best way i know how ... but there' s certain things you have to take care of .
we can go over them ... but i need to know that you' re listening to me .
i' m in a fucking state .
it' s like he' s going , and i don' t know ...
just tell me practical things , like what to do with his body .
what do i do when he dies ?
what happens then ?
that' s what hospice can take care of for you .
they' il send over a nurse ...
no .
he has phil now .
phil' s one of the nurses from the service ?
if you' re happy with phil taking care of him , fine ... but contact hospice to arrange for the body .
you don' t understand .
there' s more pain , and the fucking pills aren' t working .
the past two days , he can' t really swallow ... and i don' t know if the pills are going down .
i can' t see inside his mouth anymore .
i' m up all night staring at him ... and i don' t know if the pills are going down .
he moans and he hurts .
we can fix that , because i can give you ...
are you listening ?
i' m listening .
i' m getting better .
do you want to sit down ?
i need to sit down .
linda , earl' s not going to make it .
he' s dying .
he is .
very , very rapidly .
the thing here is to make this experience ... as painless and easy for him as possible .
you understand ?
hospice will take care of all the technical things .
they will help you and take care of the body .
they are who you call when he dies .
there' s the number of hospice .
now , as far as the morphine pills go ... there' s something else to consider .
there' s a very potent solution of liquid morphine .
and it' s a little bottle , has an eyedropper .
very easy to get into his mouth and drop on his tongue ... and it will certainly diminish the pain that he' s in .
but you need to realize that once you give it to him ... there really is no going back .
it will certainly cure his pain ... but he will drift in and out of consciousness ... even worse than he is now .
all sign of the recognizable earl will pretty much go away .
what the fuck can i say to that ?
i don' t know what to say to that .
i don' t want to do this ...
sit here .
i can see the thing , you know .
it' s getting there , that' s the cocksucker .
i see that pen .
i see it .
i know it' s there .
i reach for it .
no , no goddamn use .
i have a son , you know .

where is he ?
i don' t know .
i mean ... he' s around .
he' s here in town , but i don' t know .
you know ...
he' s a tough one .
very .
got a girlfriend , phil ?
get a girlfriend .
i' m trying .
do good things with her .
share the things .
all that bullshit is true .
find a good one , hold on , and all that .
where' s linda ?
she went out to run some errands .
she' il be back .
she' s a good girl .
she' s a little nuts , but she' s a good girl , i think .
she' s a little daffy .
she loves you .
well , maybe .
yeah .
she' s a good one .
when' s the last time you talked to your son ?
i don' t know .
ten .
maybe ten ... five .
fuck .
fuck .
it' s another thing that goes .
your memory ?
time lines , you know ?
i can remember things , but not right there .
you know ?
the fuck you know .
i' ve seen it before .
other fucking assholes like me ?
there' s no asshole like you .
cocksucker .
how come every word you use ... is " cocksucker , " " shit balls , " or " fuck " ?
do me a personal favor .
go fuck myself .
you got it .
god .
i can' t ...
i can' t hold on to this any longer .

no .

who you gonna call ?
i want to see this .

i can' t hold on to this .
i got it .
respect the cock .
and tame the cunt !

take it on head first with the skills ... that i will teach you at work and say no !
you will not control me !
no !
you will not take my soul !
no !
you will not win this game !
because it' s a game , guys .
you want to think it' s not ?
go back to the schoolyard ... and you have that crush on big titted mary jane .
respect the cock .
you are embedding this thought .
i am the one who' s in charge .
i am the one who says yes !
no !

because it' s universal , man .
it is evolutional .
it is anthropological .
it is biological .
it is animal .
we ... are ...
men !
you gwenovier ?
i' m captain muffy , frank' s personal assistant .
this is doc .
we can go in right down here .
he started about thirty five minutes ago ... but he' s probably getting all pumped up right now .
look down at the top of the page .
what does it say ?
get a calendar !
that' s right .
i cannot stress this enough .
it' s a simple item .
it' s 99 cents at the store .
but if you look into your packs , reach deep ... you' il see i have been nice enough to include one .
that' s just the kind of prick i am .
you need this calendar .
it doesn' t seem like much .
it' s a simple , small item ... but it is going to make all the difference in your world .
you meet a girl , you work an a 3 interruption .
say , an eight day waiting period before next contact .
how are you going to know when those eight days are up ?
that' s right .
you mark that calendar .
you' re going to stick with me and this calendar ... and you' re going to set goals .
if you really want to make that friend something else ... you have to be tough on yourself .
you have to set goals .
you , sir , in the brown short sleeve shirt .
i can' t read your name tag .
what' s your name ?
hi , is frank there ?
no , you have the wrong number .
i' m sorry .
i' m looking for a frank mackey .
there' s no frank here .
is this 818 775 3993 ?
yeah , but you have the wrong number .
do you know a jack , by any chance ?
just a regular deal .
loosers and tighters .
we' re all set upstairs .
thanks .
she called me up and asked me for advice about a guy .
got everything you need ?
all set .
does she know how you feel about her ?
yes .
absolutely .
and what did she say ?
she says she doesn' t feel that way about me .
i don' t think there' s anyone in this room ... who doesn' t understand that kind of pain , geoff ... and i want to thank you for sharing that .
let me tell you what we' re going to teach denise ... when we put our calendars to work and set goals .
what i say is , " denise ...
denise the piece .
i mark it down .
i write it up .
and you have been warned .
because i have my lasers ...
i have my tasers , i have my icbms ...
i have my bazookas , my jets pointed right at you .
because me and my brothers , we like to celebrate .
and on the first of may , we celebrate v day .
and come june , baby , it is the lick of my spoon .
come august , we like to celebrate ...
saint suck my big fat fucking sausage !
i set goals for myself ... and when i say i do not want to take it anymore ...
i will not take it anymore .
you think she' s your friend , geoff ? .
they' re not your friends .
do you really think she' il be there when things go bad ?
when things go wrong , think they' il be there for us ?
you think again .
fucking denise , denise the piece ... you' re gonna give me that cherry pie , sweet mama baby .
yeah , but listen up , that is not to say ... that we don' t all need females just as friends ... because we' il learn later in chapter twenty three ... having a couple of chick friends ... comes in real handy in setting jealousy traps .
we' il get to that later .
right now , pull out your blue booklets , page 18 .
we' re going quickly , but we' il workshop it later .
eighteen , blue booklet .
this is simple and clean , and if done correctly ... can be very effective in getting some bush .

you got your neighbors real worried for you .
sorry .
you live alone ?
what' s your name ?
claudia .
claudia what ?
wilson .
claudia wilson ... are you trying to go deaf ? .
what ?
did you hear what i just said ?
yes , but i don' t know what ...
you' re listening to your music so loud ... you' re going to damage your ears .
you continue to listen to your music at that level ... then you' re going to damage not only your ears ... but your neighbors ' ears as well .
i didn' t realize it was that loud .
that right there is the first sign of hearing loss .
i see you got your tv on there , too .
you usually keep that on at the same time ?
i don' t know .
what is this ?
you been doing some drugs today , claudia ?
have you been doing some drinking ?
i got a call of a disturbance here .
some loud music " a " ...
some screaming and yelling .
has there been some screaming and yelling here ?
i had someone come to my door .
someone that i didn' t want to hear .
and i told them to leave , so it' s no big deal .
they left .
i' m sorry .
was that your boyfriend ?
you don' t have a boyfriend ?
well , who was it ?
i was he' s gone .
i mean , it' s not it' s over , you know ?
mind if i have a look around for your safety ?
it' s fine .
what are you looking for ?
claudia , why don' t you let me handle the questions ... and you handle the answers ?
i' m here to help you .
do you still have to do homework ?
not as much as i used to .
since we started , i haven' t gone to school much .
i' ve had so many auditions .
i don' t have regular classes anymore .
what do you do ?
they let me have my own study time ... my own reading time in the library .
that' s pretty cool .
do you have an agent , stanley ?
you should get one .
i' m serious .
you could get a lot of stuff outta this .
like what ?
like endorsements and shit !
bite it , cynthia .
you can get free stuff ... from people who want you to endorse their product .
commercials , a sitcom , an m. o. w. or something .
what' s m. o. w. ?
hello !
movie of the week .
i went for one this morning with alan thicke and corey haim .
was it a callback ?
no .
but i' il probably get a callback .
if we beat the record , you might get a callback .
i' il get it because i' m a good actress , richard .
saucy , saucy !
guys , settle down .
cynthia ?
what ?
i gotta go to the bathroom .
can you hold it ?
yes siree !
that was absolutely fantastic , and i thank you very much .
as a matter of fact ... we may take you folks on the road with us ...
that' s my thing .
i' m serious .
milk and sports , man .
you never heard milk and sports ?
anything baseball or dealing with numbers ... when it comes to those or who broke whatever record .
any kind of dairy product or dairy recipe .
like goat milk , goat cheese , all that stuff .
check this out over here .
so , guys , just work with me on that .
excuse me , can you bring me low fat milk , please ?
a couple of ice cubes .
they don' t look so tough .
do they look smart ?
what are they going to do , beat us ?
maybe .
we' re not going out two days before we set the record .
they want us done , they' il call in the harvard swat team .
ready to run .
you smell like trouble .
i' m fucking hammered .
you ok ?
good .
you have a chance to look those over ?
it' s the same fucking shit for thirty years , burt .
you look like you have money in your pocket .
maybe i' m just happy to see my friend brad there .
just throw some money around .
money , money , money .
this sounds threatening .
do you have love in your heart ?
i have love all over .
i even have love for you , friend .
is it real love ?
the kind of love that makes you feel ... that intangible joy in the pit of your stomach ...
like a bucket of acid and nerves running around ... making you hurt and happy and all over ...
you' re head over heels ?
you lost me with the last couple of cocktail words ... but i believe it' s that sort of love .
sounds nice to me .
i have love .
a very chatty kind .
indeed you do .
no , i mean i' m telling you .
i have love .
yes , and i' m listening avidly , fellow .
my name is donnie smith , and i have lots of love to give .
lots of stuff here , huh ?
it' s thirty seconds .
got my eye on you .
i' il be back .
what the fuck' s going on over there ?
i gotta go to the bathroom .
jesus christ , stanley !
no , you cannot do that .
let me explain something to you people .
you have to tone it .
don' t be real aggressive .
you have to be subtly abusive so they don' t know it .
no , you' re not going outside and play with your friends ...
until that entire room is cleaned floor to ceiling .
julia' s room' s the same way .
like a pigsty .
but it' s outfits now .
you should have seen what she had on walking out the door !
i said , " we' re going to school , not a fashion show .
it' s not a fashion show .
it' s school , for goodness sake !
let' s make some fucking money here , people .

the book says , " we may be through with the past ...
but the past ain' t through with us .

molire .
i' m afraid i' m going to need a full name , stanley .
jean batiste poquelin molire .
what the fuck is this ?
god damn .
my little fucker .
i have no idea where he gets this shit .
he' s a fucking genius , really .
this is chad .
can i have your phone number ?
hello .
great .
this is " seduce and destroy " ?
yes , it is .
can i have your home phone number ?
i don' t want to order anything .
i have a situation that' s just come up ... that' s really pretty serious ... and i don' t know who to talk to or what i should do ... but maybe you could put me in touch with somebody ... if i explain myself ? .
we' re really only equipped to take orders here , sir .
it' s just us with the phones , and that' s what we do .
could you connect me with somebody else , you think ?
what' s the situation ?
ok , great .
let me try to explain myself without it seeming crazy .
but here i go .
my name is phil parma ... and i work for a man named earl partridge ...
mr. earl partridge .
i' m his nurse .
he' s a very sick man .
he' s a dying man , and he' s sick ... and he' s asked me to help him .... to help him find his son .
hello ?
are you there ?
i' m here .
i' m listening .
ok .
you see ...
frank t. j. mackey is earl partridge' s son .
so where are you from originally ?
around here .
valley ?
hollywood , mainly .
what did your parents do ?
my father was in television .
my mother this is going to sound silly to you .
try me .
she was a librarian .
why does that sound silly ?
i don' t know .
i guess it doesn' t .
does your mother still work ?
no , she' s retired .
are you close ?
she' s my mother .
yes , but she' s a woman , too .
how does she feel about " seduce and destroy " ?
what does she say ?
well , she says , " you go get them , honey .
what about your father ?
my father .
unfortunately , he passed away .
i' m sorry .
i had no idea .
no , please .
i wouldn' t have brought that up if i had known .
it' s a very hard thing .
please .
yes , it is , but ... listen .
you have to move forward .
the past has its place .
it was a long time ago and people die .
let' s switch gears here .
according to your book , you ended up at uc berkeley ?
' 84 ' 89 .
psychology major .
that' s right .
get your masters ?
this close .
that' s impressive in five years .
cap , can i have some coffee ?
can i get you anything ?
no , i' m good .
she' s good .
i need coffee .
cats and dogs out there , huh ?
must have a lot going on for all that stuff back there .
you could ...
you could have quite a party with all that stuff .
you been on prozac long ?
dexedrine ?
i don' t ...
interesting drugs .
dexedrine' s basically speed in a pill , you know ?
but i guess a lot of the doctors ... are balancing out the prozac with the dexedrine .
that liquid morphine will knock you down , out ... around , up and down , someone' s not careful .
you can' t mix those up .
strong stuff here , boy .
what exactly you have wrong , you need all this stuff ? .
motherfucker !
what ?
what are you talking about ?
you fucking asshole !
who the fuck do you think you are ?
i come in here ... you don' t know who i am , what my life is ... and you have the balls , the indecency ... to ask me a question about my life ?
please , lady , why don' t you just calm down ?
fuck you , too !
don' t you call me lady !
i come in here , i give these things to you ... you check , you make your phone calls ...
look suspicious , ask questions !
i' m sick !
i have sickness all around me , and you ask me my life ?
what' s wrong ?
have you seen death in your bed ?
in your house ?
where' s your fucking decency ?
and then i' m asked fucking questions .
what' s ... wrong ? !
you suck my dick !
that' s what' s wrong !
and you fucking call me lady ? !
shame on you !
shame on both of you !
so why don' t they have the same last name ?
because they don' t have the same last name .
i know , and i can' t really explain that .
but i have a feeling there is a situation between them ...
like they don' t know each other much or well .
something like they don' t talk much any more , even .
god , does this sound weird ?
i just don' t understand why you' re calling me .
there' s no number for frank in any of earl' s stuff ... and he' s pretty out of it .
like i said , he' s dying ... dying of cancer .
so ...
what kind of cancer ?
brain and lung .
my mother had breast cancer .
i' m sorry .
is she all right ?
she' s fine now .
that' s good .
it was scary , though .
it' s a hell of a disease .
it sure is .
wait , i' m sorry .
so why call me ?
i know this sounds silly , and i might sound ridiculous ...
like this is the scene of the movie ... where the guy tries to get a hold of the long lost son ... but this is that scene .
and i think they have those scenes in movies ... because they' re true .
because they really happen ... and you gotta believe me , this is really happening .
i can give you my number and you can go check with ... whoever you gotta check with and call me back ... but do not leave me hanging on this .
all right ?
please .
i' m just please .
see ... this is the scene of the movie where you help me out .
you' re great .
these are great questions .
good .
i thought you grew up in the valley .
like i said ... around .
you went to van nuys high ?
i wouldn' t say i went .
i frequented .
i was misguided , pathetic .
definitely not the frank t. j. mackey ... you' re so eagerly wanting to put on national television .
because i was swimming in what was ... as opposed to what i wanted .
where does that name come from ?
my name ?
it' s not your given name ?
it' s my mother' s name , actually .
that' s good .
done your research .
and frank ?
my mother' s father .
that' s why .
see , i had some trouble ...
locating your school records at ucla and berkeley .
it' s your name change ... because they had no official enrollment for you .
no , they wouldn' t .
no .
because i was never officially enrolled there .
was that unclear ?
kind of .
god , i wouldn' t want that to be misunderstood .
my enrollment was totally unofficial .
sadly , i couldn' t afford to pay the tuition up there .
but there were three wonderful professors ... kind enough to let me to sit in their classes .
macready , horn , and langtree , among others .
you' re welcome to call them if you like .
i didn' t get a free ride .
so what we' re looking at here is a true rags to riches story .
that' s why people respond so strongly to " seduce .
because at the end of the day ...
seduce " may not be just about picking up chicks ... and sticking your cock in .
it' s about finding out what you can be in this world ... defining it , controlling it , and saying ...
i will take what is mine .
and you just happen to get a little blowjob out of it ... then , hey , what the fuck ?
there you go .
end of round one .
excellent work .
i think we should take a look at the scores here .
kids are up a leg with 1 , 500 ... and the adults are down a little bit with 1025 .
so we' il be back for round two in a ring dang doo !
hello , hello !
bonus musical question .
and the winner is ...
kids !
kids are in the lead .
they get a chance to pull further and farther ahead ... if they answer the following secret bonus musical question .
now what i' m going to do is read a line from an opera .
i want you to give me that line back ... in the language in which the opera was originally written .
and for a bonus 250 250 ... you can sing it !
here' s the line .
love is a rebellious bird that nobody can tame .
and it' s all in vain to call it ...
if it chooses to refuse .
well , that was in french ... and that was from the opera " carmen ... " and that goes ...
l' amour est un oiseau rebelle
que nul ne peut apprivoiser
et c' est bien en vain qu' on i' appelle
s' il lui convient de refuser
see you got some coffee brewing here .
yeah , it' s not it' s been on for a bit .
i like iced coffee , generally ... but a day like today , with the rain and whatnot ...
i enjoy a warm cup .
do you want a cup ?
is that all right ?
it' s raining cats and dogs out there .
i' d just as soon not go back in it .
i don' t know how fresh it' s going to be .
i' m sure it' s fine , claudia .
do you take cream or sugar ?
that' d be fine .
so , claudia , let me just say ... so i can get my role as an lapd officer ... out of the way here before we enjoy our coffee .
i don' t like to talk shop over coffee .
i' m not going to write you up .
i' m not going to give you a citation here ... but the real problem is that you got people around you ... people who work from home , trying to get work done .
and if you' re listening to your music that loud ... they' re inconvenienced by that .
if you had a job , you' d probably understand ... but you like listening to your music .
that' s fine .
just want to keep an eye on the volume level .
maybe memorize what number you see on the dial .
if it' s the middle of the day , that' s what i do .
i just set it at two and a half ... and then i know that' s a good listening level for me .
but you like listening to your music loud .
that' s fine .
that' s cool .
it' s good to rock out sometimes .
but you can' t do it every day ... or else you risk damaging your ears .
seriously .
you listen to it all the time like that ?
you' re going to drive these people crazy .
anyway , you get the point .
cheers .
so this boyfriend bothering you ?
i don' t have a boyfriend .
the gentleman who was at the door ...
he' s not my boyfriend .
a lot of times , in domestic abuse situations ... the young woman is afraid to speak out .
you don' t have to be afraid to tell me anything .
and as a police officer , i can tell you ... it goes bad places .
young woman' s afraid to speak out ... next thing you know , i' m here on a 187 .
what' s a 187 ?
it' s not good .
and it' s where situations like this always lead .
it' s not my boyfriend , and it' s not anything .
it' s over .
really .
he won' t come back .
i don' t want to have to come back here ...
you won' t have to !
i wouldn' t mind coming back .
you know , get a look at your pretty face again .
i' il be right back .
here you go .
let' s get the jacket off .
it' il help you to breathe .
i can' t fucking do this .
i' ve i ...
i think i' m gonna throw up .
i think .
i haven' t thrown up since i was twenty years old .
what' s the problem ?
i need to go to the bathroom .
jesus christ , stanley .
you can' t go now .
you have exactly one minute before we' re on the air .
now is not the time to go to the bathroom !
why does this fucking shit always happen , stanley ?
excuse me , is there a problem ?
mind your own business !
you watch your mouth , young man !
why don' t you mind your own business ?
oh , no , she didn' t !
wait for the commercial break , then you can go .
just hold it .
don' t taunt the kids .

i don' t have a chance .
i' m fucked .
and fifteen seconds .
ten seconds .
and five , four , three , two ...
we' re back , ready for round two !
and we' re talking to our adult contestants here today .
mim , it says here that you live in chatsworth , california ... and that you have two kids .
that' s right .
i have a six year old ...
do you know who i am ?
you' re a friend of the family , i presume .
what does that mean ?
nothing special .
just a spoke in the wheel .
you talk in rhymes and riddles and rub a dub .
but that doesn' t mean anything to me .
see , i used to be smart .
i' m quiz kid donnie smith .
i' m quiz kid donnie smith from tv .
it might have been before my time .
i remember .
in the sixties , right ?
i' m quiz kid donnie smith .
like you said .
smart kid !
you got struck by lightning once .
so what ?
i heard about that .
did it hurt ?
but you' re all right now .
so what' s the what ?
what ?
that' s right .
i used to be smart .
now i' m just stupid .
brad , dear , who was it that said ...
a man of genius has seldom been ruined but by himself " ?
it was the lovely samuel johnson .
who also spoke of a fellow " who was not only dull ...
but a cause of dullness in others " ?
the cause of dullness in others .
picky , picky !
let me tell you this .
samuel johnson never had his life shit on ... and taken from him and his money stolen !
who took his life and his money ?
his parents ?
his mommy and daddy ?
make him live this life like this ...
a man of genius who gets shit on as a child ... and that scars !
that hurts !
have you ever been hit by lightning ?
it hurts .
it doesn' t happen to everyone .
it' s an electrical charge .
it finds its way across the universe ... and it lands in your body and your head !
and as for ruined but by himself ... not if his parents took his freaking life ... and his money and tell you to do this ... and to do that , and if you don' t ...
your parents took your money you won on that game show ?
yes !
they did .
what does that mean , a spoke in the wheel ?
things go round and round , don' t they ?
yes , they do .
they do .
but i' il make my dreams come true .
sounds sad as a weeping willow .
i used to be smart .
but now i' m just stupid .
shall we drink to that ?
i want to talk a little bit more about your background .
you made some references earlier ... to subjective human experiences and terrible things ...
actually , i' m confused about your past .
is that still lingering ?
it' s so boring .
just want to clear some things up .
excuse me .
thank you , muff .
it' s a funny thing that ...
this is an important element of " seduce and destroy ... " facing the past is an important way of not making progress .
this is something i tell my men over and over and over .
this isn' t meant ...
i try to teach my students to ask ...
what is it in aid of ? .
are you asking me that ?
well , in trying to figure out who you are ...
in aid of what ?
frank , i' m saying that in trying to figure out ...
i have more important things to put myself into .
i think this is something important ... you might need to think about putting yourself into .
not really .
it' s not like i' m trying to attack you here .
this is how you want to spend your time , go , go , go .
but you' il be surprised at what a waste it is .
the most useless thing in the world ... is that which is behind me .
chapter three .
we talked earlier about your mother ... and about your father and his death .
i don' t want to be challenging , but i have to ask .
i just want to clarify something that i understand ...
i' m not sure i hear a question in here .
i' m trying to put this as delicately as i can .
what' s the question ?
do you remember miss simms ?
i know a lot of women .
i' m sure she remembers me .
from when you were a boy .
she lived in tarzana .
that' s my old stomping ground .
is this the attack portion of the interview ?
is the girl coming in for the kill ?
no .
this is about getting something right ... and clarifying your answers to an earlier question .
what question ?
i was told that your mother died , frank .
that' s what you heard .
do you remember miss simms ?
i talked to miss simms , your neighbor and caretaker ... after your mother died in 1980 .
and in my research ...
i have you as the only son of earl and lily partridge .
and what i learned from barbara simms ... is that your mother , lily , died in 1980 .
so , it' s my understanding that information supplied ... by you and your company and the answers ... to the questions i' ve asked is incorrect , frank .
and if i want to get to the bottom ... of who you are and why you are ... then i think that your family history ... your actual family history ...
well , this is important .
what is your fucking question ?
well , i guess my question' s this ...
why would you lie , frank ?
kids ... adults ...
i would like you to put yourself at a picnic .
place yourself there with your family and friends ... if you' d like .
you' il hear three musical notes , and you are to tell me ... what it might represent that you would find at a picnic .
the first three notes .
guys .
yes , todd .
well , jimmy , i know this .
i have perfect pitch , and that would be a d e ... and that would represent lemonade .
for 250 .
next notes , please .
got it .
that' s e g g , which would be egg .
for 500 .
and the third set of notes .
guys ?
you don' t want any water ?
no .
i just ...
i' m so fucked up right now , alan .
there' s just so much , so many things .
are you on drugs right now ?
if i tell you something , you' re a lawyer , right ?
you can' t say anything , tell anybody .
it' s like a privilege .
attorney/ client .
you understand ?
not exactly .
like a shrink .
if i go see a shrink , i' m protected .
i can say things fuck !
i don' t know what i' m doing .
linda , you' re safe .
it' s all right .
you' re my friend .
you and earl are clients .
whatever you want to say won' t leave this room .
you have something you want to say to me ?
i have to tell you something .
i have something to tell you .
i want to change his will .
can i change his will ?
i need to .
no , you can' t change his will .
only earl can .
no , you see , i never loved him .
i never loved him .
earl .
when i met him , i fucked him , and i married him ... because i wanted his money .
you understand ?
i' m telling you this ...
i' ve never told anyone , i didn' t love him ... but now , i know i' m in that will .
we made that fucking thing , and all the money i' il get .
i don' t want it , because i love him so much now .
i' ve fallen in love with him now for real as he' s dying .
i look at him , and he' s about to go , alan .
he' s moments ...
i took care of him through this .
what now , then ?
let' s listen .
hello , mary .
how are you and the seven kids ?
as you probably heard by now ... we sure gave that pope a run for his money .
that would be robert e. lee .
his wife was mary parke custis .
i know he had seven children .
and he would be talking about pope ... who he defeated at the battle of manassas .
absolutely right , miss mim .
next question .
come on .
snap out of it , man .
come on , stanley .
bonjour , josephine .
maintenant je suis en egypte .
yes , mim .
that would be napoleon speaking to josephine .
absolutely right , for 500 .
next voice .
i don' t want him to die .
i didn' t love him when we met ... and i did so many bad things to him that he doesn' t know .
things that i want to confess to him ...
but now i do .
i love him .
linda , what kind of medication are you on ?
this isn' t any fucking medication talking !
can you give me nothing ?
you have power of attorney .
can you go in the final moments and change the will ?
i don' t want any money .
i couldn' t live with myself with this thing that i' ve done .
i fucked around .
i fucking cheated on him .
there .
you' re his lawyer , our lawyer .
i am his wife .
i broke the contract of marriage .
i fucked around on him many times .
i sucked other men' s cocks .
adultery is not against the law .
you can' t use it in court to discredit the will .
linda , calm down .
i can' t .
you don' t have to change the will .
if you want nothing , renounce the will when the time comes .
what does that mean ?
where does the money go ?
it goes to the nearest relative .
what' s that ?
that' s frank ?
no .
that can' t happen .
earl doesn' t want him to have anything .
that' s what will happen .
this is so fucked up i can hardly stand it .
linda , stop !
now , you take a moment , you breathe ... and one thing at a time .
shut the fuck up .
want me to help you ?
shut the fuck up !
you need to sober up .
now , you must really shut the fuck up .
please , shut the fuck up .
i have to go .
let me call you a car .
shut the fuck up !
now , imagine that you are attending a jam session ... of classical composers ... and they have each done an arrangement ... of the classic favorite " whispering .
now , we have here the new world harmonica trio ... who are going to play ... three variations on the theme ... as three classical composers might have written it .
so you are to name the first composer .
guys .
yes , todd .
that sounded like brahms .
a bit like his " hungarian dance number six .
that is excellent , todd .
next composer , guys .
stanley the man .
i don' t know the answer .
that is not right .
that' s not right , stanley .
the correct answer is ravel .
ravel .
and now i' m gonna have our three whistlers ... please to present the next musical ...
and this' il be the third section that the whistlers ... and they' il play a piece that' s ...
it' s very recognizable .
chopin , actually .
and it' s in the style of " marche militaire .
it' s a very recognizable piece .
so if you please just listen to this ... and i' m sure you can identify the ...
i' m sort of giving away the answer here .
it' s chopin .
i don' t mean to give away the answer .
it' s just please just ...

he' s been doing it for thirty years .
you don' t know how sick he really is .
it' s a fucking game show , mary .
hear that ?
does that hurt ?
what is it ?
it' s in my ear .
it' s tmj .
it' s what it' s called .
technically .
how about they just call it , " clicking jaw " ?
pain in the jaw , yeah .
how about that ?
easier to remember .
yeah .
it gets ...
i don' t even know if i have it , actually .
15 l 27 , i' m currently code seven .

no , i' m ...
i was wondering ...
man , i feel like a bit of a scum bucket doing this ... since i came here as an officer of the law ... and the situation and everything ... but i feel like i' d be a fool ... if i didn' t do something i really want to do ... which is to ask you for a date .
you want to go on a date with me ?
please , yes .
well , is that illegal ?
sort of .
then i' d like to go .
what do you want to do ?
i don' t know .
i hadn' t thought about it .

i have thought about it .
i' ve been thinking about it since you opened the door .

i thought you were flirting with me a little .
you want to go tonight ?
i' m off tonight , yeah .
what time ?
8 : 00 .
i don' t get off until 10 : 00 .
10 : 00 .
yeah .
fine .
yeah .
bye .
frank , i' m really not trying to attack you here .
i think if you have something that needs to be cleared up ...
i was told that your father is earl partridge .
i was told that he left you and your mother ... and you took care of your mother during her illness ... that you took care of her while she struggled with cancer ... and that miss simms became your caretaker ... when your mother finally passed away .
can you talk about your mother , frank ?
no , no , not true .
and you know what ?
even if you don' t get to pump her ... you still need to practice your skills on a feminist .
i will .
you need to do that .
this is doc .
doc , it' s janet .
i have to talk to frank .
he' s in the interview , janet .
interrupt him .
get him on the phone with me right away .
what happened ?
doc , go get frank and put him on the phone .
come on , frank .
what are you doing ?
what am i doing ?
i' m quietly judging you .
and five , four , three , two ...
oh , boy , what a day .
what a round .
back and in for me and ... and the final one on one round ... to determine who' s who today .
let' s check the scores on the board , shall we ?
well , the kids have an even 2, 000 ... and the adults are way up with forty seven .
now , that doesn' t mean that this game ... is out of reach for the kids .
elders , who' s the lucky so and so ?
it' s me , jimmy .
come on over , mim .
i don' t want to go .
i can' t do it this time .
what the fuck are you talking about ?
you have to go , stanley .
you' re the smartest .
i don' t want to go .
why can' t one of you do it ?
if you don' t fucking stand up and get over there ...
i' il beat your ass .
i' m sick of being the one , always has to do everything .
i don' t want to be the one always .
kids , i don' t even have to ask .
stanley , get your butt over here .
i' m sick .
i' m sick here now .
i confuse melancholy with depression sometimes .
you see ?
why don' t you run along now , friend ?
your dessert is getting cold .
i' m sick .
stay that way .
i' m sick , and i' m in love .
you seem the sort of person who confuses the two .
that' s right !
that' s the first time you' ve been right .
i confuse the two , and i don' t care !
i love you .
i love you , and i' m sick .
i' il talk to you tomorrow .
i' m getting corrective oral surgery tomorrow ... for my teeth .
i love you , brad .
brad the bartender .
if you want to love me back , i' il be good to you .
i' il be goddamn good for you .
i won' t be mad if you don' t know who said what .
i won' t punish you if you get the answer wrong .
i can teach and tell you ...
you have a special secret crush over there , i think .
don' t treat him too lovely .
he might get hurt .
you shut up !
mind your own business .
gently , son !
brad , i know you don' t love me now .
it' s a dangerous thing to confuse children with angels .
want to know the common element for the entire group ?
i' il tell you the answer , because i had that one .
i had that question .
carbon .
carbon .
in pencil lead , it' s in the form of graphite .
in coal , it' s mixed up with other impurities .
and in the diamond , it' s in hard form .
all we really wanted to know was the common element ... but thank you for all that unnecessary knowledge .
kids .
heads so full of useless knowledge .
thank you .
thank you .
and the book says , " we may be through with the past ...
but the past is not through with us !
and ... no , it is not dangerous ... to confuse children with angels .
well , that is what i wait for .
i wait for those calls .
and i wait and i pray .
and sometimes jesus says ...
jim , i got a surprise for you today .
i want you to meet this young lady , ok ?
now , where it goes from there is up to you .
and i don' t think you' re going to screw it up .
and , god , i' m telling you right now ...
i will not screw it up .
you gave me an opportunity .
i' m going to treat this young lady right .
i' m a happy cop .
it' s called jaywalking .
slow down .
i' m going to pass , jimmy .
stanley , passing to one of the other kids .
we want stanley to go , jimmy .
i don' t want to go .
i' m walking towards the elevator , janet .

phil , are you still there ?
yeah , i' m here .
i want to ask you one question .
phil , have you talked to anyone else about this ?
no , i haven' t .

i' m putting you on hold .
thank you .
how close are you , doc ?
richard ?
julia ?
kids , what' s going on ?
i need a player here for one on one .
we want stanley to go , jimmy , and we' re not sure why he won' t .
i always answer the questions ... and i don' t want to do it anymore .
what the fuck is he doing ?
what' s wrong with him ?
i have no idea .
i' m getting off of the elevator , janet .

good boy .
i' m walking down the hall .
this kid ain' t getting up , we don' t have a show .

so that' s what you did ?
you sat it out ?
you wanted my time .
i gave it to you .
you called me a liar .
you made accusations .
you said , " well , if i had known ...
then i wouldn' t have asked .
so it' s not an attack .
i don' t want to be the sort who doesn' t keep his word .
so i gave you my fucking time , bitch .
now , fuck ...
it' s fucking janet .
there' s a situation on the phone .
the indecision of a child , ladies and germs .
this isn' t funny .
this isn' t cute .

because i' m not a toy .
i' m not a doll .
the way we' re looked at because you think we' re cute ?

i' m made to feel like a freak ... if i answer questions ... or i' m smart ... or i have to go to the bathroom ?
what is that , jimmy ?
what is that ?

i heard your father' s voice in the background .

they' re at the house .
i asked him the exact address , and he gave it .
i know this is really hard for you right now .
if you' re gonna give me things , give me the information .
i want the information .
that' s what i want .
what did he say ?
because i am not taking care of him .
what does he want ?

but let' s get down to brass tacks .
let' s get right down to it , boys .
men are shit .
what ?
men are shit .
isn' t that what they say ?
because we do bad things , don' t we ?
we do horrible , heinous , terrible things .
things that no woman would ever do .
no , women , they don' t lie .
no , women don' t cheat .
women don' t manipulate us .
but you see what i' m getting at .
you see what society does ?
little boys , it' s , " wow , woman !
we are taught to apologize .
i am sorry .
i am so sorry , baby .
i am so sorry .
what is it that ...
what is it that we need ?
is it their pussies ?

hello , dear .
i need a favor .
all right .
back up , max .
back up , miles .
hello .
you frank ?
jack , right ?
are you phil ?
tried to get in touch with you .
we got disconnected .
stay in , max !
hey , come on !
please !
i got the message .
i couldn' t find you .
earl asked me , so i looked through the address books .
there' s no number .
there' s nothing .
is what' s her name ...
linda ?
no , she went out .
she' s not here .
hey , i' m sorry .
i don' t know what to do here .
your dad asked me to get in touch with you ... and i didn' t have the number .
i called the number .
want to come in ?
yeah .
hey , phil ?
yeah ?
i will drop kick those fucking dogs if they come near me .
all right .
come on in .
this is blake .
clear them out .
miles .
here we go .
all right , he' s in here .
so we all go in here .
want to go in ?
no , i just stand here a second , phil .
lady !
hey , wake up .
what' s wrong with you ?
here .
how do we do this , then ?
well , we just do it .
we do it .
we figure it out .
we do as we do , i guess .
do you love me , rose ?
you are my handsome man .
i' m a bad person .
i mean ...
i' m telling you this now ... because i want everything to be clear and clean ... and i want to apologize for me and the stupid things i' ve done .
i' ve cheated on you .
i' ve cheated on you , and ... it kills me ... and the guilt of what i' ve done ...
i don' t want you to think that ...
maybe you knew .
i think maybe you' ve known .
so i hope this is not just for me ... for me to make myself feel better about what i' ve done ... but for you not to feel like you' re sitting there ...
like a jerk .
you' re the good one .
you understand ?
did you ever go out with someone and just lie ... question after question ?
maybe you' re trying to make yourself look cool ... or better than you are or whatever ... smarter , cooler ... and you just ...
not really lie ... but maybe you just don' t say everything .
that' s a natural thing .
you know , two people go out on a date or something .
they want to impress people ... the other person .
or they' re scared they' il say something ... that will make the other person not like them .
thank you .
thank you .
so you' ve done it ?
i don' t go out very often .
why not ?
i never found someone , really , that i' d like to go out with .
i bet you say that to all the girls .
want to make a deal with me ?
what i just said ... people afraid to say things ... no guts to say the things that are real or something ... to not do that .
to not do that that maybe we' ve done before .
let' s make a deal .
i' il tell you everything , and you tell me everything ... and maybe we can get through all the piss , shit , and lies ... that kill other people .
piss and shit .
what ?
you really use strong language .
i' m sorry .
no , it' s fine .
i didn' t mean it seems vulgar or something , i know .
it' s fine .
i' m sorry .
it' s nothing .
i' m sorry .
i' m gonna run to the bathroom for a minute maybe , just ...
i' m going to go in .
are the dogs in there ?
yeah , but they stay by the window .
i want you to come in with me and stay away from me .
i want you there in case he needs anything ... because i am not going to help him .
and , phil , i will drop kick the fucking dogs ... if they come near me .
you don' t look that bad .
you prick .
cocksucker . " that' s what you used to like to say , right ?
cocksucker .
but you are a cocksucker , earl .
it hurts , doesn' t it ?
you in a lot of pain ?
she was in a lot of pain .
right to the end , she was in a lot of pain .
i know because i was there .
you didn' t like illness , though , do you ?
i was there .
she waited for your call .
for you to come .
i am not going to cry .
i am not going to cry for you !
you cocksucker , i know you can hear me .
i want you to know that i hate your fucking guts .
you can just fucking die , you fuck .
and i hope it hurts .
i fucking hope it hurts .
her resps are down to six .
let' s get the gurney over here .
check that ego
come off it , i' m a prophet
the professor
i' m gonna teach you ' bout the worm
who eventually turned to catch wreck
with the neck of a long time oppressor
and he' s runnin ' from the devil
but the debt is always gainin '
and if he' s worth bein ' hurt
he' s worth bringin ' pain in
do you feel better now that you' ve said this ?
i don' t know .
well , i' m not ... mad .
well , i am , but i' m ... not .
you know ?
i love you so much , rose .
i' m not through asking my questions .
why doesn' t claudia ... talk to you , jimmy ?
why ?
because we' ve ...
we both don' t know .
what do you mean ?
no , i think you know .
maybe ...
i don' t .
say it , jimmy .
i wanted to do that .
well ...
that felt good to do to do what i wanted .
can i tell you something ?
yeah , of course .
i' m really nervous that you' re gonna hate me soon .
you' re gonna find stuff out about me and hate me .
no .
like what ?
what do you mean ?
you have so much , so many good things ... and you seem so together .
you' re a police officer ... straight and put together without any problems .
i lost my gun today .
what ?
i lost my gun today ... and i' m the laughing stock of a lot of people .
i wanted to tell you .
i wanted you to know .
it' s on my mind .
it makes me look like a fool .
and i feel like a fool .
you asked that we should say things ... say what we' re thinking and not lie about things .
i can tell you that i lost my gun today .
i' m not a good cop .
i' m looked down at , and i know that ... and i' m scared that once you find out , you won' t like me .
jim , that was so great .
i' m sorry .
what you just said .
i haven' t been on a date since i was married , and ... that was three years ago .
whatever you want to tell me ... whatever you think might scare me won' t .
i will listen to you .
i' il be a good listener if that' s what you want .
and i won' t judge you .
i know i do that sometimes .
i won' t .
and i can listen .
and you shouldn' t be scared of scaring me off ... or whatever you think that i think and on and on .
just say it , whatever it is , and i' il listen .
you don' t know how fucking stupid and crazy i am .
it' s ok .
i got troubles , ok ?
i' il take everything at face value .
i started this , didn' t i ?
fuck !
whatever it is , just say it .
you' il see .
you want to kiss me ?
yes , i do .
say it , jimmy .
i think she thinks ... that i may have molested her .
she thinks terrible things that somehow got into her head ... that i may have done .
she said that to me last time when it was ...
ten years ago she walked out the door .
you touched me wrong .
i know that .
some crazy thought in her head .
did you ever touch her ?
i don' t know .
i don' t know .
i really don' t .
but you can' t say .
i don' t know what i' ve done .
yes , you do .
you do !
but you won' t say .
i don' t know .
what ?
please .
please .
you deserve to die alone for what you' ve done !
i don' t know what i' ve done .
yes , you do !
if i said that i knew , would you stay ?
but i don' t know what i' ve done .
you should know better !
now that i' ve met you would you object to never seeing me again ?
what ?
just say no .
i won' t say no .
wait , claudia .
just let me go , jimmy .
what is it ?
please , please .
why didn' t you call ?
i fucking hate you .
god damn you , fucking asshole .
oh , god , you fucking asshole .
don' t go away , you fucking asshole .
oh , god , don' t go away , you fucking asshole .
what am i doing ?
what the fuck am i doing ?
oh , fuck .
what ?
what are you doing , dummy ?
oh , brother .
there are frogs falling from the sky .
come on !
come on !
claudia , it' s mom !
open the door , honey !
claudia , are you there ?
mom !
mom !
mom !
mommy !
all right .
all right .
it' s ok .
it' s all right now .
it' s ok .
it' s gonna be all right .
this happens .
this is something that happens .
and there is the account of the hanging of three men ... and a scuba diver ... and a suicide .
there are stories of coincidence and chance ... and intersections and strange things told ... and which is which and who only knows ?
and we generally say ...
well , if that was in a movie , i wouldn' t believe it .
someone' s so and so met someone else' s so and so ... and so on .
and it is in the humble opinion of this narrator ... that strange things happen all the time .
and so it goes , and so it goes .
and the book says ...
we may be through with the past ... but the past ain' t through with us .
i' m sorry , jack .
it' s the hospital calling about linda .
who ?
linda .
she' s in the hospital .
i figured you should probably talk to them since you' re here .
is she gonna be all right ?
could you please tell me where you' re located ?
are you with us , linda ?
good .
it is , linda , isn' t it ?
just relax .
that' s it .
you' il get through this .
dad .
dad , you need to be nicer to me .
go to bed .
you have to be nicer to me , dad .
go to bed .
i know i did a stupid thing .
so stupid .
getting braces .
i thought ...
i thought he would love me .
getting ... braces .
for what ?
for something i don' t even ...
i don' t know where to put things , you know ?
i really do have love to give .
i just don' t know where to put it .
a lot of people think this is just a job that you go to .
take a lunch hour ... job' s over .
something like that .
but it' s a 24 hour deal .
no two ways about it .
and what most people don' t see ... is just how hard it is to do the right thing .
people think if i make a judgment call ... that' s a judgment on them , but that is not what i do .
and that' s not what should be done .
i have to take everything ... and play it as it lays .
sometimes people need a little help .
i got a buddy who' s supposed to be real good ... at corrective oral surgery .
sometimes people need to be forgiven .
and sometimes they need to go to jail .
call me about that guy with the teeth , ok ?
and that is a very tricky thing on my part ... making that call .
i mean , the law is the law .
and heck if i' m gonna break it .
you can forgive someone .
well , that' s the tough part .
what can we forgive ?
tough part of the job .
tough part of walking down the street .
i just wanted to come here ... to come here and say something ... say something important , something that you said .
you said we should say things and do things .
not lie , not keep things back ... these sorts of things that tear people up .
well , i' m gonna do that .
i' m gonna do what you said , claudia .
i can' t let this go .
i can' t let you go .
now , you ...
you listen to me now .
you' re a good person .
you' re a good and beautiful person ... and i won' t let you walk out on me .
and i won' t let you say those things ... those things about how stupid you are and this and that .
i won' t stand for that .
you want to be with me ... then you be with me .
you see ?
