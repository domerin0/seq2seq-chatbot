what' s all that spanish junk right there ?
mouth , you said you can translate .

ye intruders beware .
crushing death and grief ... ... soaked with blood of the trespassing thief " .
this map is old news .
everybody went looking for that when our parents were our age .
haven' t you heard of him ?
what' s his name ?
the pirate guy .
one eyed willy .
one eyed willy !
the most famous pirate in his time .
my dad told me all about him .
dad' il do anything to put you to sleep .
no !
see , one eyed willy stole a treasure once .
and it was full of rubies and emeralds ...
and diamonds ?
and diamonds .
then he loaded it onto his ship ... ... and sailed away into the sunset .
until the british king found out about it ... ... and sent out his whole armada to go after him .
it took them a couple of weeks to catch up with willy .
then there was a whole big war ... ... between the armada and willy' s ship , the inferno .
during the firefight , there were ... ... guns and cannons bursting here and there .
then willy fled , because he knew he' d get killed if he stayed around .
and then he got into this cave ... ... and the british blew up the walls around him .
he got caved in , and he' s been there ever since .
forever ?
forever .
and ever ?
trapped .
you sound as corny as dad does .
my dad tells the truth .
know what he said ?
he said one eyed willy and his bunch were down there for years .
they were digging tunnels and caves .
setting booty traps .
booby traps .
setting booby traps so anybody who tried to get in would die .
then he killed all his men .
why ?
why kill all of them ?
so they wouldn' t get his treasure .
wait a minute .
if he killed all his men , how did the map get out ?
my dad said one of the guys must have gotten out with the map .
hey , mikey , i believe you .
i don' t believe you at all .
what did you break this time , chunk ?
hey , you guys , look at this .
you ever hear of this guy ?
chester copperpot .
look what it says .
chester copperpot , missing while in pursuit of local legend .
reclusive scavenger claims , " i have the key ... ... to one eyed willy " .
wow , do you guys realize what we could do ?
nobody ever found nothing .
why would this map be in this attic ... ... when it could be in some safe deposit box , right ?
right .
if chester copperpot didn' t find it , how would we find it ?
but what if ?
you guys ... ... what if this map can lead to one eyed willy' s rich stuff ?
we wouldn' t have to leave the goon docks .
come on , mike .

now i dropped my glasses .
i can' t see a thing .
oh , my god .
i found your glasses .
sorry .
you broke them .
you broke my glasses !
listen , i' m the oldest , so i' m in charge .
first , we' il ...
data , do you have a light ?
i said i was in charge .
data , do you have a light ?

back up , back up .
bully blinders !
all right , data ...

one day i was walking home with it , and two big guys stopped me ...
who is that ?
oh , stef , that' s you .
watch out .
data !
come on , turn it off .
oh , data .
the only problem is the batteries don' t last so long .
there' s a light up ahead .
maybe we can get out that way .
let' s go .
i' m not afraid of the dark .
i like the dark .
i love it .
but i hate nature .
i hate nature !
wait a sec !
hold it !
stop !
i' m just a kid !
what seems to be the problem ?
mister , i need a ride .
my friends and i had a run in with disgusting people .
you might' ve heard of them , the fratellis .
we found their hideout .
could you take me to the sheriff ?
i can describe all three of them .
will you ...
what the hell ?
he' s only a kid .
can' t you handle a kid , even ?
does it work , guys ?
yeah !
i can' t see .
mouth , your father' s a plumber .
what are these pipes ?
these look like water pipes , guys .
gas pipes .
drainage .
maybe ...
wait a minute .
shut up for a minute !
these pipes must lead to a building or something .
a foundation .
so maybe if we bang on them hard enough , if we make enough noise ...
how are you , duke ?
hey , gene , how are you ?
great .
reverse pressure !
daddy !
let' s ...
get out of ...
here !
like now !
go , go , go !
first , we start with the pudgy little fingers .
then the plump little hands .
then the fleshy arms .
now , tell me where your friends are .
in the fireplace .
don' t lie to me !
honestly .
we found a map over at mikey' s dad' s place ... ... that said there was buried treasure under here .
don' t give us none of your bullshit stories , huh ?
spill your guts .
tell us everything .
everything ?
everything .
okay , i' il talk .
in 3rd grade , i cheated on my history exam .
in 4th grade , i stole my uncle' s toupee and glued it on my face ... ... when i played moses in my hebrew school play .
in 5th grade , i knocked my sister down the stairs , and i blamed our dog .
wait , i can' t see a thing .
what am i stepping on ?
oh , brother .
look , a lantern .
somebody must have been here before us .
maybe they' re still here .
i hope not .
look at these cigarettes .
ten minutes ago , troy was looking down my shirt .
who cares ?
it' s not wrong .
if i' d been smart , he' d still be looking .
listen to her .
what' s wrong with her ?
andy , it' s okay .
is she all right ?
i should' ve let him look at my body .
don' t i have a beautiful body ?
you' ve got a great body .
how many years do i have before i get fat ?
before my hair falls out ?
before i look like him ?
then my mom sent me to a summer camp for fat kids .
then , once during lunch , i got nuts and i pigged out ... ... and they kicked me out !
look at him .
don' t touch it , guys .
this is one of your tricks , right , one eyed willy ?
you must be really hiding something to go through all this trouble .
there' s nothing to worry about .
you don' t understand !
don' t be afraid .
he' s dead for sure .
i think he' s chester copperpot .
chester who ?
who ?
don' t you remember from the attic ?
the news article ?
the last guy to look for the rich stuff ... ... he went in , but he never came back out .
that was back in 1935 .
oh , god .
if he didn' t make it out and he was an expert , what about us ?
how will we get out ?
don' t worry about it .
calm down .
you sure ?
i' m positive .
how will we get out ?
we can' t be sure it' s him .
i know it' s him .
i bet his i. d. is in his wallet .
mouth , get his wallet .
lou gehrig ?
you get it , mikey !
mikey , get it .
it is chester copperpot .
oh , god .
come on .
you see ?
i told you .
we' re gonna get killed too .
hey , look at this .
candles .
they' re gonna kill us .
we' re dead .
where are you going ?
i' m setting booty traps .
booby traps .
that' s what i said .
i' il set booby traps in case anyone follows us ... ... like the fratellis .
we' il hear them coming .
okay , hurry up .
good idea .
where you going ?
to set booty traps .
you mean booby traps .
that' s what i said .
booby traps !
god , these guys ...

oh , god !
there' s no way out of here .

freeze !
run , you guys , run !
holy shit !

wait , listen .
sounds like somebody' s down there .
shut up and listen .
maybe it' s a way out .
or the fratellis .
or chunk got the police .
or one of willy' s booby traps .
god put that rock there for a purpose .
i' m not so sure you should move it or anything .
hello ?

we' re gonna get rabies !
but the worst thing i ever done , i mixed up fake puke at home ... ... and i went to this movie theater , hid the puke in my jacket ... ... climbed up to the balcony ... ... and then i made a noise like this ...
and then i dumped it over the side ... ... on all the people in the audience .
then ...
then this was horrible .
all the people started getting sick and throwing up on each other .
i never felt so bad in my entire life .
i' m beginning to like him , ma .
hit puree .
no , i' m too young !
no !
i want to play the violin !
not my hand !
do i get the truth ?
do i get the truth , or do you get juiced ?
what was that noise ?
fireplace blew .
the kid' s not kidding , ma .
there' s a tunnel down there .
watch your hair !
they' re going for the hair !
watch your veins , ma !
hey , mikey , if you can hear me , run !
run !
they' re coming after you !
hey , if we keep going this far down , we' il reach china .
maybe i can go see my auntie or something .
this could get dangerous , andy .
you might want to hold my hand .
thank you .
oh , wow !
oh , neat !
that' s beautiful .
guys , look !

i mean , he played kennedy once .
