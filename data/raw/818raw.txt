a lot of security .
but the take ..
what' s the target ? .. 8 figures each .
what' s the target ?
when was the last time youre in vegas ?
you want to knock over a casino .
the vault at the bellagio .
well , if im reading this right
and i like to think that i am ,
this is propably the least accessible vault ever designed .
yep .
you said three casinos .
these featuring the cages of the mirage
mgm grand , but every diamond is up there .
bellagio , the mirage .
these are terry benedict' s places .
yes , they are .
eating your mind ?
somewhat .
you' d need at least dozen of guys doing combination of cons .
what would you think ?
at the top of my head , i' d say your looking at ...
lebowsky , jim brown , miss daisy ... two jethros ... and leon spinks .
not to mention the biggest ella fitzgerald , ever .
do you think you can get the money to back this ?
if we hitting these three casinos , we get our bank role .
benedict' s gotta long list of enemys .
yeah , but enemy with loose cash , and nothing to lose .
ruben .
ruben .
hey !
oscar , lower a bit will you ?
sorry .
you guys done up here ?
just wanna take this home and make some copy' s , if thats alright .
what ever you need .
appreciate it .
what ?
i need a reason .
don' t say money .
why do this ?
why not do it ?
because yesterday i walked out that joint after losing four years of my life ,
and your cold deckin teen beek cover boys .
because the house always wins .
play long enough you never change the stakes .
the house takes you
unless , when that perfect hand comes a long , and you bet big ,
and then you take the house .
you' ve been practising this speech , havent you ?
little bit , did i rush it ?
no .
it' s good , i liked it .
i wonder what ruben will say .
you out of your god damn minds
are you listening to me ?
you both of you nuts .
i know more about casino security than anyman alive .
i invented it .
and it cannot be beaten .
they got cameras , got watchers , they got locks ,
they got timers , they got vaults .
they got enough armed personel to occupy paris .
okay .
bad example .
it' s never been tried .
never been tried .
it' s been tried .
a few guys even came close .
you know the three most successful robberies in the history of vegas ?
number three , the bronze metal , hanson grabs a lock box at the horse shoe .
he got two step closer to the door than any living soul before him .
second most sucessful robbery .
the flamingo in 71 .
this guy actually taste the fresh oxygen before they grab him .
ofcourse , he was breathing out of a hose for the next three weeks
god damn hippy .
and the closest , anyman has ever come to robbing a las vegas casino .
was out side the caesar' s in 87 .
he came .
he grabbed .
they conquered .
but what i' m saying , you guys are pro' s .
the best .
i' m sure you can make it out of the casino .
of course , last we forget
once you go out of the front door , you still in the middle of the fucking desert .
your right .
he is right .
ruben , you' re right .
our eyes are bigger than our stomachs .
that' s exactly what it is , pure ego .
thank you for lunch .

i owe you from the thing with the guy and the place ..
i' il never forget it .
that' s my pleasure .
give dominic your addresses , i got some remained furniture i wanna send you .
look , just out of curiosity .

it' s bellagio , the mirage and the mgm grand .
those are terry benedict' s casino' s .
is that right ?
that' s right .
you guys ..
what do you got against terry benedict ?
what do you have against him , thats the question .
he torpedoed my casino , muscled me out .
now he' s gonna blow it up next month to make way some gorge monstrosity ..
don' t think i don' t see what your doing .
what are we doing , ruben ?
you gonna steal from terry benedict you better god damn know ..
it used to be civilized , he' d hit the guy , he whacked you , done , but with benedict ...
the end of this ...
better not know youre involved
not know your names , or think your dead , because he' il kill you .

gentlemen , welcome to las vegas .
everybody' s eaten ?
good .
everybody' s sober ?
close enough .
alright , before we get started , nobody' s on the line here yet .
what i' m about to propose to you is both highly lucrative and highly dangerous .
if that doesn' t seem to be your particular brand of vodka
help yourself have food as much you like and have a safe journey , no hard feelings .
otherwise come with me .
you' re bobby caldwell' s kid , huh ?
from chicago ?
yeah .
it' s nice there , do you like it ?
yeah .
that' s wonderful , get into the god damn house .
gentlemen , the three thousand blocks of las vegas boulevard .
otherwise known as the bellagio , the mirage and the mgm grand .
together they are the three most profitable casinos in las vegas , let me see .
this is the vault at the bellagio .
it' s located below the strip .
beneath 200 feet of solid earth , it safe guards every dime that passes thru each of the three casinos above it .
were gonna rob it .
smash and grab job , huh ?
slightly more complicated than that .
yeah ..
this is courtesy of frank catton , new blackjack dealer at the bellagio .
ok , bad news first .
this place houses a security system that rivals most nuclear missile silos .
first , we have to get within the casino cages .
which anybody , i' il tell you , takes more than a smile .
next , thru these doors .
each of which requires a different sex digit code , changed every twelve hours .
pass those , lies the elevator , this is where it gets tricky .
the evelator wont move without authorized finger print identification .
which we cant fake .
and vocal confirmation from both the security system within the bellagio and the vault below .
which we won' t get .
further more , the elevator shaft is rigged with motion detectors .
meaning , if we' d manually override the lift , the shafts exit would lock down automaticly , and we' d be trapped .
now , once we get down the shaft though , then it' s a peace of cake .
just , two more guards , with uzi' s ,
and the most elaborate vault door ever conceived by man .
any questions ?
why don' t we go underground ?
no tunneling is out , there are sensors monitoring the ground a hundred yards in every direction .
if a groundhog would nest there , they know about it .
anyone else ?
you said something about good news ?
yeah .
the nevada gaming commission stipulates that a casino must hold an reserve , enough cash to cover every chip on the planets floor .
that means on a weekday by law .
it has to carry anywhere between $60 and $70 million in cash and coin .
on the weekend ,
between 8 0 and 9 0 million .
on a fight night , like the one two week' s from the night tonight , we gonna rob it
hundred and fifty million , without breaking a sweat .
now , there are eleven of us , each with an equal share , you do the math ..
exactly .
i have a question .
say we get into the cage , and through the security door there , and down the evaluator , we can' t move . and pass the guards with the guns . and into the vault we can' t open .
without being seen by cameras .
o' yeah , sorry i forgot to mention that .
well , say we do all that , would you suppose to walk out of there with $150 million in cash on us , and without getting stopped ?
yeah .
ok .
alright , here' s how we begin .
first task , reconnaissance .
we wanna know everything thats going on , on all three casinos .
from the rotation of the dealers ,
to the path of every cash coin .
wanna know every thing about every guard , every watcher ,
anyone with the security pass .
i wanna know where they from ,
what their nicknames are , how they take their coffee .
most of all , i want you guys to know these casino' s .
built as labyrints , to keep people in ,
i want you guys to know the quick routes out .
10 : 46 , gotta watch the horse .
second task , power .
on the night of the fight , we gonna throw the switch on sin city .
bash , it' s your show .
you want broke , blind and bedlam .
how about all three .
right , it' s done .
third task , surveillance .
casino security has an eye in the air on everything .
so , we need an eye in the air on them .
livingston ?
well , it' s not the least accessible system i' ve seen , but it' s close ,
then it' s definitely a black bag job .
how many technicians ?
two .
and one of ' em is lonely .
thanks , honey .
i' il have it back in an hour .
send hi to your mom , for me .
say it yourself .
she' s off in five minutes .
watch it , bud .
who you calling bud , pal ?
who you calling pal , friend ?
who youre calling friend ?
jackass !
don' t call me jackass .
i just did call you jackass .
33 , we have a visual reduce at the north 0352 exit door camera .
copy that , i see them .
sir , please remove your baloons .
you got in my way .
gentlemen ..
balloon boy .
balloon boy ya balloon boy .
damn , were up and running .
why are they always painting hallways in that colour ?
they say it' s very soothing .
i' m gonna need to tell you to remove these balloons , now !
hey , hold up a minute .
excuse me .
hey .
excuse me .
hey , you drop this .
ah , thank you .
how' s the reception on these things ?
excellent .
take care .
well .
ya .
fourth task , construction .
we need to build an exact working replica of the bellagio vault .
for practise ?
something like that .
fifth task , intelligence .
we need those codes linus , from the only guy who has all three .
benedict ?
learn to love your shadow .
wait , wait , wait ,
all i get is to watch the guy ?
you gotta walk before you can crawl .
sixth task , transport .
i am sorry , but 18, 5 a piece , is the best offer that i can make .
well , i understand .

yes , sir , top of the line .
okay , thank you for your time , mr ..
denim , billy tim denim .
yes .
denim like' em jeans ?
yes !

man , you got some lovely hands .
do you moisturize ?
i am sorry ?
i' ve had tried all sorts of brands and lotions , i even wore a fragrant free for whole year .
now , my sister , she uses a ... .. alovera .
with a little sunscreen in it .
and i dearly speak , you ' all should wear gloves before you go to bed .
i' ve found out there might be little interference with my social agenda , you know what i mean ?
so im really not getting into the traditional remidies , you know .
i see , let me tell you something .
if you' re willing to pay cash ,
i might be able to drop that down to say seventeen , sexteen , each ?
no .
you do that ?
well , yes sir .
that will be lovely , they told me come see you .
i' m sure glad they did .
okay , well .
let me go get the paper work ..
and , and , and ..
i' il be right back .
you just wait here .
you do that .
thank you , sir .
it' s a very nice material .
it' s imported silk , saul .
very nice .
gentlemen , would you excuse us for second ?
saul , are you sure you really ready to do this ?
if you ever ask me that question again , daniel ,
you will not wake up the following morning .
he' s ready .
my name is lyman .
my name is lyman zerga .
my name is lyman zerga .
okay , tell me about benedict .
that guy is a machine .
good afternoon , mr benedict .
he arrives at the bellagio every day at 2 : 00pm .
same car , same driver .
remembers every vale' s name on the way in .
not bad for a guy worth 3/ 4 of a billion .
offices are upstairs , he works hard , hits the lobby floor at seven on the note .
good evening , sir .
spends three minutes on the floor with his casino manager .
what do they talk about ?
all business .
benedict likes to know whats going on in his casino .
likes to been in control .
theres rarely an incident , he doesn' t know about or handle personally .
spends a few minutes gladhanding the high rolers .
he' s fluid in spanish , german , italian and he' s taking japanese lessons and getting pretty good at it .
he' s up by 7 : 30 when an assistant hands him a black portfolio .
contents , todays take and new security codes .
then , he heads to the restaurant .
like i said , a machine .
that portfolio contains the codes , to all the cage doors ?
in two minutes after they changed he got' em in his hands .
tell you , you really can' t pick him .
this guy' s so smart as he is ruthless .
last guy they caught cheating in here ,
he not only sent him up for ten years ,
but he had the bank cease his house ,
then he bankrupted his brother in law tracktor dealership .
he doesnt just take out your niece , the guy goes after your livelihood , and the livelihood of anybody you ever met .
you scared ?
you suicidal ?
only in the morning .
now what ?
now comes the girl .
where she come from ?
museum up there .

here she is .
this is the best part of my day .
still dont know if we can use her yet .

ok .
now .
tell me this is not about her .
or , i' m walking off this job right now .

tess .
terry benedict .
tell me it is not about screwing the guy who' s screwing your wife .
ex wife .
tell me .
it' s not about that .
it' s not entirely about that .
remember when we first got into this business .
we said , we' re gonna play the game like we' d have nothing to lose .
i lost something .
i lost someone , thats why i' m here .
here' s the problem .
now were stealing 2 things .
if you can' t have both , which you gonna choose ?
and remember ...
tess does not split in 11 ways .
if everything goes the plan ,
then i wont be the one , who have to make that choice .
how she looked ?
she look good .
thanks .
you like it ?
i like that you like it .
i' il see you tonight .

i don' t believe in weakness , it cost too much .
i don' t believe in questions either .
oh , really ?
well let me give you a tip .
i wouldn' t get in to terry benedict ,
for too much money .
he doesn' t fool around .

mr. zerga , lyman zerga .
third position .
he wants to speak to you privately .

funny , i never got a cheque .
you are not wearing your ring .
i sold it .
i don' t have a husband and you didn' t get the papers .
i told you i' d write .
danny ...
go now , before ...
what ?
benedict ?
how are you doing ?
whiskey , in a whiskey .
danny .
tess , you' re doing a great job , curative the museum ,
the vermeire , is quite good .
simple , vibrant , although the work definetly fell of as you got older .
do i remind you of anyone ?
i always confused monet and manet ,
now , which one married his mistress ?
monet .
right , and then manet had syfilis .
they also painted occasionally .
i will make this quick .
i came here for you .
want to get on with my life , and want you with me .
you are a thief , and a liar .
i only lied about being a thief .
i don' t do that anymore .
steal ?
lie .
i' m with someone now that doesn' t have to make that kind of distinction .
he is very clear on both .
you know what your problem is ?
i only have one .
you have met too many people like you .
i' m with terry now .
does he make you laugh ?
he doesn' t make me cry .
mr. benedict , the fight is on saturday night , is it not ?
yes , would you like some tickets ?
no , no , hand to hand combat does not interest me .
i have a package arriving here that evening .
black briefcase , standard size .
the contents of which is very valueble to me .
i' il put in the house safe for you .
the house safe is for brandy and grandmothers pearls .
i need something more secure .
mr. zerga , i can assure you that our house safe is ...
i can assure you , mr. benedict ,
that your generosity in this manner will not go overlooked .
now , what can you offer me besides the safe ?
see the people you steal things from ?
they have insurance to compensate them , they get made whole again .
i had to leave new york to get away from what happened .
how am i gonna get my 5 years back , danny ?
you can' t .
but what you can do is not throw away another 5 .
alright , you don' t love me anymore ,
you want to make life with someone else , fine .
i will have to live with that .
but not him .
spoken like a true ex husband .
i' m not joking , tess .
i' m not laughing , danny .
you have to admit , there is a bit conflict of interest ,
when you give me advice about my love life .
yes .
but that doesn' t mean that i' m wrong .
do you remember what i said to you when we first met ?
you said i' d better know what i' m doing .
do you ?
because truly , you should walk out the door if you don' t .
i know what am i doing .
what are you doing ?
just catching up .
terry , meet my ex husband .
daniel ocean .
i' m in your seat .
forgive me for being late .
i guest caught my attention .
thats fine .
danny was walking thru the restaurant and spotted me .
is that right ?
yes , imagine the odds .
of all the restaurants in the world .
you recently where released from prison , is that correct ?
thats right .
how does it feel to be out ?
about the same .
danny was just about ...
i just stop by to say hi to tess for old time sake .
stay and have a drink .
he can' t .
i can' t .
i don' t imagine you will be seeing mr. ocean anytime soon , right ?
you never know .
i know everything happening in my hotels .
so i should put those towels back ?
no , the towels you can keep .
good to see you tess .
take care danny .
terry .
danny .
do whatever you like .
call us at 17 . 30 .
make up in costumes .
saul' s package arrives at 19 . 05 .
linus grabs their codes .
if all goes well , were go .
19 . 30 , yen gets locked in , were commited .
from this point we have 30 minutes to blow the power ,
once the electricity goes ,
all access points to the vault , and it' s elevator , will automaticly shut down for 2 minutes .
thats when we make our move .
ok .
lets put you in the middle of the room .
10 feet from everything .
we have to get from there , to the door , and without touching the floor .
what do you do ?
10 is too short .
twenty .
yeah , were in deep shit ..
the proxy democrats uses a coax auxilliry , to back the main line , have they ?
they only rise the level on the mainframe couplet .
right up .
do you understand any of this ?
i' il explain later .
listen ..
they blown the backup grid one by one , like dominoes .
bash , what happened ?
they did the same thing i' ve would done ,
only they did it by accident .
problem is , they know about the weakness and are sorting it out .
they' re fixin ' it .
so unless we intended to do this job and re know .. .. were in barney .
.. trouble !
we could always ...
by tomorrow .
hang on a minute , hang on .
we could use the pinch .
whats a pinch ?
a pinch is a device which creates a cardiac arrest for any broadband electrical circuitry .
but better yet , a pinch is a bomb .
but without the ' bomb ' .
when a nuclear bomb detonates , it unleashes an electro magnetic pulse , which shutdowns any powersource within its blast radius .
it tend not matter in most cases , because the nuclear weapon usually destroys everything you might need power for anyway .
but a pinch creates a similar electro magnetic pulse , but without the fuzz of mass destruction and death .
how long ?
about 30 seconds .
can a pinch knock out the power of an entire city ?
like for instance .. .. lasvegas ?
i think it might .
but there is only one pinch in the world big enough that would manage it .
well .
lets go , come on .
where you going ?
come with you ?
no .
no , no , no .
don' t leave me with these guys !

who the hell is this ?
the man who' s robbing you .
what the hell is going on in the vault ?
nothing sir .
it' s all normal .

i' m afraid you' ve mistaken .
you watching your monitors ?

this time your luck changed quite quickly .

it would be better if you were not around here for this ..
alright .
you proved your point ,
you broke into my vault ,
congratulations ,
you' re a dead man .
maybe .
maybe ?
may i ask how you expect to leave ?
do you believe i' m gonna allow you to carry bags full of my money thru the casino doors ?
no , you' re gonna carry it out for us .
now why would i do that ?
take a closer look at your monitor .
as your manager' s properly reporting to you now
you have little over $160mn in your vault tonight .
you may noticed
we' re only packing up about half of that .
the other half , we' re leaving in your vault , booby trapped as a hostage .
you let our $80 million go , and you get to keep yours .
thats the deal .
if you' d trying to stop us , we blow both cascets .
mr. benedict ?
you could lose $80mn tonight secretly or you could lose $160mn publicly .
it' s your decision .
hi .
make the call .
911 emergency response .
where' s danny ?
danny' s fine .
he' s in a good form .
he requested you' d go upstairs and watch tv .
he does ?
we have 3 men with explosives who have taking control in our vault .
ok .
it' s alright , tess .
you have a deal .
i promise .
fantastic , here' s what you do .
the guys in the vault will deposit six bags into the vault elevator .
the elevator will rise to your cages .
three of your guards will pickup the bags and carry them out into the casino .
now , if they take more than 20 seconds to reach the casino floor
or there' s any indication a switch has been made , we blow the money in the bags and the money in the vault .
he' s in the casino by the slots .
ofcourse i' m in the casino .
in fact , i' m staying in your hotel .
i have two word' s for you , mini bar .
as soon as your guards hit the casino floor
a white unmarked van is going to pull up in your valet station .
your guards will load the bags into the van' s rear .
if anyone so much as approches the drivers door
we blow everything .
when i get the word , the van is away and the money is secured
my men will exit the building .
once their safety is confirmed
you will get your vault back .
swat team is here .
alright .
now
i have complied with your every request .
would you agree ?
i would .
good .
cause now i have one of my own .
run and hide , asshole .
run and hide .
if you should be picked up next week by an $100 000 postal
i' m gonna be supremely dissapointed
because i want my people to find you
and when they do , rest assure
were not gonna hand you over to the police .
so , my advice to you again is this
run and hide .
that is all that i ask .
mr. benedict
