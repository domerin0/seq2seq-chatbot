' black hole ' ?
that' s simple .

i am very sorry .
why the ice ?
otherwise it may boil .
sometimes it is too hot here .

it' s a disaster , captain , we have sunk .

something exploded .
what exploded ?
a mine .
i heard it' s a mine .

two ...
hey , ' slavs ' !

shut up and lighten yourself .
o o , it' s you .
it' s me .
chernenko .
give it to me .
he was giving us pills .
antistressant .
keeps your spirits higher ...
really ?
not lower ?
no , higher !
confirmed by clinic tests .
are you wailing after taking a too many of your pills ?
i' m not wailing .
i' m singing .
singing what ?
a song .
i always sing , when it is ... spooky .
you sing again i' il bust your singing piece in .
clear ?
it is waterproof .
i specially bought it .
can you explain to me what happened ?
why should i ?
dive !
it' s not a real crash , okay ?
it' s a make believe alarm .
make believe ?
sure thing .
make believe sinking .
make believe ?
yeah , it' s maneuvers .
it' s sham sinking after being chased by a sham enemy ship .
sham sinking ?
all things sham in the navy , except eating .
' slav girl ' is missing .
it' s yanychar , i' m not surprised .
but the exercise time is over .
gena knows no standards .
he accomplished his mission to remain unnoticed .
and again he has broken the rules .
what about the brass ?
they think hard .
we had graduated from the same school .
back then he was a legend already .
this yanychar of yours is a miscreant .
if i had my way with him ...
nobody can have his way with gena .
can you dive without our help ?
i did some diving in turkey and passed instructions here .
don' tjerk with your legs too much in the water .
next diver' s head is right behind you .
where are we going now ?
to the mess room .
maybe there is another scholar guy stuck there .
what' s wrong with you ?
calm down .
let us read something .
what haven' t we read ?
' she felt no fear ,
' she knew that nothing bad could happen to him .
' assol was still the same little girl
' who had her own way of praying . '
mama , read louder , i do not sleep anyway , and gena is a sound sleeper .
i will stay with him .
what do you mean ?
you know what i mean .
fresher !
i thought that was the end .
i got cramps in my leg .
where is fresher ?
we were hit by a strong wave !
have you been conceived by a flaccid prick , scholar ?
nojerking with your legs .
fresher , are you okay ?
i' m fine .
never mind .
we' il shall yet break dance with you .
' we' re made of different stuff ' , right ?
some scholar .
the road between moscow and leningrad is lousy with them .
i know why you elbowed your way to the submarine .
i know your kind .
you wanted triple salary , right ?
you , scorpion .
you shouldn' t have said this .
you don' t know a thing about me .
nor do i want to .
but your status ...
status of a soldier ?
i do not think it' s funny .
you' re right , status of a defender of my country .
but whom should i defend here ?
myself .
your self ?
myself .
why the heck i should defend you ?
because you have your straps , and i haven' t .
so what ?
it is your duty to defend citizens of your country .
whetheryou like them or not .
is it clear now ?
clear .
aren' t you a ukrainian guy by any chance ?
i' m russian .
why ?
we had a guy named chan also a russian .
but he turned out to be a ukrainian , an ex politician .
comrades submariners !
today we may at last say
that our cherished dream came true .
now we , citizens of the free ukraine , possess the sea , the sun and this sacred land .
we are no longer somebody else' s granary feeding our hungry and lazy big brother , who is fond of drinking into the bargain .
after some time our country will become like slavic france or canada .
where is lvan ?
nelly is in heavy labours .
today we are all to face heavy labours .
captain lvanov !
yes , sir !
you , pubic bone ...
ljoin the military and pledge solemnly to the ukrainian people to be a loyal and faithful officer , to protect ukraine , its sovereignty ...
to abide in good faith
ukraine' s constitution and its laws , to keep the state and military secrets .
i pledge to perform my duties in the interests of my compatriots , neverto betray the ukrainian people .
captain konovalenko !
after lvanov you , konovalenko , have no choice .
olga won' t forgive you .
captain konovalenko !
mikola , you promised to your wife and in laws .
they are not here now .
you have your house and garden here .
you prefer naked sands and polar night and rachitis foryour kids ?
those willing to take a pledge to ukraine
two steps forward .
the others follow me !
yanychar , wait !
hold your people !
it is an order !
you darned condom .
orchestra !
orchestra !
' slav girl farewell ' !
yes , sir !
the crew , march on !
i got frightened !
this is a pretty sham sinking !
i thought they were alive , but they were all dead !
shut up !
why didn' t you tell me the truth ?
where' s the commander ?
commander .
you didn' t tell me the truth !
you need the truth ?
all right .
the third cell is flooded , same as the second one .
if the first one is flooded too , we are the only survivors .
and ourturn will also come soon ...
' the world paid so little attention to him
' that he considered himself a dead man ' .
what ?
what are you going to do ?
will you bring here some light .
give me a hand .
comrade captain ...
here .
wind gets stronger , 20 meters per second .
turbulence 5 points .
visibility reduced down to 5, 5 km .
continue the search in the defined area .
start sending signals in keeping with the instructions .
mukhambetov .
have you taken the pliers ?
what do you mean : ' where ' ?
in our language it means ' yes ' .
roman cleans the debris , put the hardware on torpedoes .
deryugin , how are you ?
those rooting for ' spartak ' are never stuck .
' spartak ' is the champion !
we are all champions here .
let it be light !
mukhambetov , you are the best .
i wonder , lvan alekseevich , the boat is a mess , but the eggs are intact .
they lie quietly in their cells .
an egg is the nature' s mystery .
the partition door is locked !
have you tried to open it ?
i have .
they did not let me turn the rack gear .
have you knocked ?
yes .
so ?
they knocked me back .
rap shall win !
how many breathers do we have ?
twelve .
twelve ?
exactly .
you go first and i follow you .
or vice versa .
we may knock , but i think they will not let us in .
why not ?
by the book , they' ve no right to let us in .
i wonder why ?
because it is prohibited by sl !
attention , i' m commander of cell 3 .
if you hear me , answer .
if you hear me , answer .
we hearyou very well .
we hearyou very well .
i am sailor fresher .
it may be one way communication .
if you hear me give a knock .
how many of you are there ?
two , it seems .
or he surfaced to get some air .
hpa .
high pressure air .
and sl ?
what do you need it for ?
you never know .
no letting in .
categorically .
of course it' s a risk , but ...
we may all get drowned here .
ten is betterthan two .
nikolai , suppose it was you behind the partition ?
i wouldn' t knock in their place .
attention !
we' re getting ready to let you in .
clear ?
at first we give you hpa .
by this time the doorto cell 3 should be open .
clear ?
watch the level to be reduced .
on reaching the third cell , batten yourselves down , give us a knock and stand by .
clear ?
give hpa !
align pressure between the cells .
legkostupov , be careful !
i hope you all know how to blow the air ?
fresher !
quickly to the partition door .
when the level reduces , batten yourself down .
in 1986 boat 320 ...
i remember .
an 0 . 5 difference smashed 3 people against the wall .
pressure in cells reached seven point five .
ready ?
i count to three .
on three we open the door .
one , two , three !
' ln this respect assol
' was the same little girl
' good morning , god ! ' and ' good night , god ! '
' ln her mind this little was enough
' forthe god to keep away all her misfortunes .
' she knew that god was busy with other mlns of people
' and minor shadows of life
' she should take patiently ... '
a child was born and made his first step , and his first words were ' spartak '
' spartak ' is the best .
i root for ' locomotive ' .
we' il make you warm and reform you .
the song makes things prosper .
all in your cell safe ?
i battened down in time .
i was dead asleep and woke up right in the water .
seen anybody ?
yes .
gena ?
i came on behalf of the commander .
it' s not even me , it is the baby who gets nervous .
and you left him behind ?
no , he is here with me .
usually he is quiet , but today ...
i even read a book to him ...
did it help ?
for a while .
you know ...
they' il give you a lift now and then you' il go to sleep , ... sleep like an angel .
like an angel ?
yes .
because exercises proceed as planned , there is a contact with the submarine .
your husband has successfully completed shooting ...
shooting ...
i may send him your love during next contact .
there is no need to do this .
it' s not me , it' s the baby who gets nervous .
i see ...
now you' ve a sin on your soul .
you wanted me to tell herthe truth ?
wait a second .
i know where to look forthem .
have you sent our coordinates to the hq ?
the emergency buoy has been torn away by the storm .
we can' t radio them from underwater .
we have to surface .
or at least to nearthe surface .
which we can' t do .
we can only ... knock .
but we have to do something !
do i irritate you ?
me ?
no .
thanks .
because even taxi drivers stop talking to me after a while .
may i ?
why not .
don' t be too gluttonous .
yes .
tomorrow we' il be leaving through torpedo sections .
tomorrow ?
tomorrow .
we' il be using moustings .
moussings , you shitty scholar !
treat yourself , captain .
comrade commander , may i ?
i have known yanychar since military school .
speak to the point .
despite his mischief he would never leave the assigned area ...
evidently the submarine was moved away by underwater currents .
he should be somewhere here .
are you sure ?
yes .
72 meters .
not far away from home .
comrade commander , there are 12 breathers , and we are 13 .
does it mean that someone stays behind ?
i even know who stays behind .
me ?
everybody rests .
wake up time at six a . m .
who is to be the thirteenth one ?
haven' t yet decided .
let it be me .
why ?
it all happened because of me .
not because of me personally , because of this watch .
you said you wanted to become a submariner .
i' ve heard this story .
not exactly .
' no way !
' and no watch foryou ! '
and he died afterthat .
he was a very obnoxious person .
he did not like submariners ?
he hated them .
his girlfriend had walked out on him with a submariner .
so when he was lying in the coffin , ljust ...
lifted the watch ?
he did not need it anyway .
he was dead already !
what a man !
you' re still full of surprises .
so it is all because of me .
why ?
can' t you see ?
my granddad went to war in this area , he set mines .
so it was his mine !
his mine ?
he has taken revenge on me !
because of the watch !
now is it clear ?
yes .
go to sleep .
chernenko , what kind of a song do you sing when you feel afraid ?
my mother' s .
sing it now .
i can' t go to sleep .
will you ?
oh , no .
don' t be too proud ...
see , you have a mother .
you said you were lonely .
my mother is dead .
i am sorry .
comrade commander !
tell us some story .
you have a way of telling funny stories .
a screamer , eh .
just the right time forfunny stories .
ok , you deserve it .
i' il tell you a fairy tale .
not about a cockerel , but about a cow .
this was not long ago , but long ago , it seems .
our army seemed to be almost done for .
and it still seems almost done for .
people were afraid to wear uniforms .
they' d steal and trade everything , from old underwear to secret torpedoes , at the same price , mind you .
officers became bandits , bankers , politicians .
but only two orthree persons had left gena ...
so to survive through the winter we went to a collective farm to dig some potatoes .
comrade commander , they' ve brought empty sacks .
i say , empty sacks ...
i and gena doubled in at an old lady' s .
and her cow was even older , nobody milked it for a hundred years , so the old lady decided to have it slaughtered .
somehow our citizens are convinced that a russian mariner may slaughter anybody , even a cow .
i' il fry some liverforyou and make steaks .
only slaughter my beloved cow , pretty please .
granny manya , how can i ever do it ?
i am a submariner .
i had no wish to slaughter her beloved cow .
i am fond of animals since childhood .
please , do it , my dear .
will you offer me a bottle ?
two bottles !
today they paid my daughter with pepper vodka .
well ...
' bandmaster ' .
what ?
i found a concertina .
take it .
you are welcome .
we had a miner , his name was ... never mind his name ...
he' d slaughter his own brother ,
let alone a cow , for a bottle ,
very well .
so i went to look for him , but he was nowhere to be found .
so i went to gena ...
will she give us vodka ?
two bottles !
we' il do this !
the cow has a heart ...
on the left side ...
on the left side .
if we put her on her hind legs , it will be on the left side ...
but also the cow has horns .
too bad .
yes .
how about cracking a bottle first ?
comrade captain .
you were looking for me ?
a problem with a cow ?
comrade captain , may i ?
go ahead .
there is another way of killing it .
a secret weapon .
explosion ...
no ...
guided action .
here it is ...
the newest development .
it all depends on where you place the charge .
if you place it underthe cow' s tail , it will be cut into two equal parts .
if you fix it to her horns , the explosion will be as strong as a hammer blow from the local smith .
to the horns !
a bit to the right .
not to hurt her eyes .
everything will be all right , commander .
the submarine was not on a firm ground .
is it on a firm ground now ?
now it is .
i nearly had a yellow streak .
me , too .
so afterthis story the cow started giving milk .
i bit my tongue .
we hit the bottom , but we are together , and spartak is the best !
spartak is the best !
golden fish , keep us all alive ...
i am not afraid , not at all .
maybe a little bit .
board 26 !
here is the principal direction of the search .
the sector 90 090 ...
we are going out by threes .
the first and the last will be the most experienced ones .
i will stay in .
when you all surface , captain orlov will go back here with a breather , and we go up together ...
captain , what about your diving suit ?
no more questions .
yes , sir .
comrade captain , my breather is defective .
same with mine .
and with mine , too .
krauz , you were in charge of breathers , weren' t you ?
yes .
have you checked them ?
have they been in order ?
don' t you have anything to tell us ?
i had no time to sell this ,
i should have left them with my daughter .
wearthem yourself , hans .
i promised , when our daughter was born ... with rubies .
unpaid debts is a bad sign .
i shouldn' t have taken them along .
tie him up !
with what ?
gimme the scarf .
don' t .
don' t humiliate me , peter .
why , nikolai ?
nikolai !
a knuckle sandwich will tell him about discipline .
lieutenant orlov !
you are the last sailor in my cell !
the last sailor ?
do you know who is to be the last but one ?
so , brothers , you have blown it !
you were receiving the breathers ?
lieutenant orlov !
stop it !
restore power supply .
yes .
mukhambetov !
follow me with the instruments !
playing dolls with them ?
hit them in the mugs !
better late , than never .
say it !
we were standing ...
go on !
' let' s go and receive breathers . '
we took a truck and set off .
we would stop every now and then .
why ?
what for ?
when krauz saw someone passing by he would tell the driver to stop and he' d go out .
then he went out and ordered us to go and get the breathers .
get the breathers .
go !
yes , sir !
he tried to sell earrings .
you know , captain ...
krauz' s wife two times him with a kiosk guy , because he has heaps of money , and a sailor has empty pockets , although he has ten autonomous missions to his credit .
krauz loves his wife , and they have a daughter ...
so he started borrowing money to buy earrings , to keep his promise .
and the bitch wouldn' t accept them .
how do you know this ?
after a hearty drink ...
you drink with someone , he opens his heart to you .
though , there is a risk of opening your own heart .
i see .
so , you received the breathers ?
did you check them ?
' the breathers are fresh from the plant . '
we have to check them .
check any one at random .
and the truck was honking .
have you checked them ?
only one .
was it charged ?
yes ...
nelly , i propose to you , from my very heart .
hey , romeo , ' twas not in the deal .
you' il break your neck .
don' t worry .
pick up your stuff .
i' ve come foryou .
vanya and i are getting married .
i know that you love ' me ' .
not him , but me .
vanya and i are getting married .
nonsense !
we' il rectify it right now .
hold it !
peter .
shit !
peter !
lieutenant orlov !
here !
come to me .
yes , sir !
we' il come back and get repaired .
take a seat .
yes , sir !
whom , in your opinion , shall we send ?
a sailor is no advisor to a captain .
sorry i hurt yourfeelings .
i lost my nerve .
we need someone physically strong , a good swimmer and diver , an experienced person .
and a person of moral integrity .
i know such a person .
captain lvan muraviev .
i wanted to take your advice ...
it wants a lucky guy .
actually , everybody here is lucky , unlucky ones are left behind the partition door ...
how about casting a lot ?
cards may be a better option .
let' s play ' fool ' .
a ' fool ' will go ...
with straps .
everyone here is with straps .
but one ...
' young to poupyr .
p. s.
' which in greek means ' see below ' .
' yesterday i drank the sea water .
that' s something !
' something you will never forget ... '
' i' il come back and tell you ... '
comrades ...
officers ...
brothers ...
i have so much to tell you ...
words fail me .
i have words , but they are not proper .
i thought real heroes never existed , they were just made up by people .
but you are real heroes , you are real russian sailors .
forgive me forthinking ill about you once in a while ...
forgive me , that it is me who is going , and not ...
forgive me if you can .
i will do my best
i will do my best to ...
you asked me to sing a song , but it is a ukrainian song .
so you' re ukrainian !
i knewjust as well !
and you said it was of no importance .
my mother was ukrainian , my father no one knows who .
so , you asked me ...
this is a 3 mm latex foryou .
comrade captain , may he take my cap , for extra warmth .
god be with you .
bend your head .
comrade captain , may i write a note ?
to be ashamed of it later ?
no notes !
sit down .
we need to remove airfrom the diving suit .
otherwise you will hit the surface like a cork .
breathe quietly , slowly , okay ?
with this you click onto moussings .
and exhale 14 times .
then you move up till the next moussing , okay ?
don' t be rush .
you crawl up and push the buoy in front of you .
as soon as you reach the front lid , knock with this clevis .
we let in sea water and align pressure .
we open the front lid .
as soon as you are out , fix the clevis to a hook on the left side of the hull .
an eye hole like hook ...
a hook like this ...
don' t forget to fasten it , or else you and us ...
understand ?
when you reach the surface , quickly move this thing to the atmospheric breathing .
and yell at the top of your lungs , to get rid of nitrogen in your blood .
otherwise it will be caisson disease foryou .
don' t remove your hydro suit on the shore , it will be heavy , at least you will not freez ,
take care of the breather while crawling along the pipe .
then keep on running , like a sprinting hippo ...
traffic lights , the curb ...
you' il walk along the curb and you' il see a woman ...
awoman , and another woman .
oh yeah !
do it .
you may go free , great people .
oxygen left for 12 more hours .
hey , fresher .
fancy for an orange ?
i know this trick .
no oranges .
you' re wrong .
presto !
help yourself , sir .
ticking on .
i' ve neverthought how great life is .
nikolai , how are you ?
i want to go to venice .
it' s where othello strangled his desdemona .
great foryou .
we' il go sight seeing .
only he strangled her in cyprus .
what a shame .
' cause i want to go to venice ...
