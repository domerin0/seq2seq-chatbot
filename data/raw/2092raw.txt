the young girl ... sat perfectly still in the confessional ...
iistening to her father' s boots scrape like chalk ... on the ancient steps of the church ... then grow faint , then disappear altogether .
she could sense the priest beyond the grate
on that particular friday afternoon ...
iast february ...
i was reading a story to my advanced writer' s workshop ... by one james leer , junior lit major ... and sole inhabitant of his own gloomy gulag .
she bit the flesh of her lip ... closed her eyes , mute .
james ' stories were about as sunny as his disposition .
i was distracted .
maybe it had something to do with the fact ... that my wife had left me that morning .
so .
anyone ?
maybe not .
wives had left me before .
carrie .
as usual , james ' classmates ... aware of a writer' s inherent vulnerability ... offered their sensitive , gentle opinions .
i mean , jesus , what is it with you catholics ?
all right .
all right .
let' s try to be constructive here , shall we ?
howard , what about you ?
i hated it .
his stories make me want to kill myself .
that' s not exactly what i meant by being constructive , howard .
yes , hannah ?
i think maybe we' re missing the point .
hannah green .
a talented writer who rented a room in my house .
i knew her to be insightful , kind ... and compulsively clad in red cowboy boots .
i had , in fact , never once seen her without them .
he respects us enough to forget us , and ... that takes courage .
well put , hannah .
and a good note to end on , i think .
oh , don ' t forget about wordfest this weekend .
and those of you who are driving v. i. p. s ... to the cocktail party this evening ... should have them at the chancellor' s house ... no later than 5 : 30 .
thank you for that .
is he all right ?
i think so .
how about you ?
me ?
yeah .
why ?
just checking .
turn off the light , please .
it felt good to be in the car .
alone .
where i could clear my head .
tonight was the opening of wordfest ... the university' s annual three day " gabathon " ... for writers and wanna bes .
my editor , terry crabtree , was flying in for the event .
he alone had championed my last novel , arsonist' s daughter ... and its critical success had put us both on the map .
but that was seven years ago ... and i still hadn' t finished my follow up .
i knew terry didn' t give a rat' s ass about wordfest .
he was coming to town to get a look at my long overdue book .
i had to keep him at bay .
ah , tripp .
crabtree , how are you , my friend ?
it' s good to see you , tripp .
let me help you with this .
say hello to my new friend .
miss antonia  sloviak .
nice to meet you .
this way .
i took the liberty of inviting antonia to tonight' s festivities .
the more the merrier .
terry was telling me about you on the plane .
it was all so interesting .
i was just explaining how a book comes to be published ... what you do as a writer , what i do as an editor .
i sweat blood for five years , and he corrects my spelling .
that' s exactly what he said .
we know each other pretty well .
and actually , it' s seven years .
you know how many times i' ve board ed an airplane just praying ... that some gal like her would be sitting down beside me ?
she' s a transvestite .
you' re stoned .
she' s still a transvestite .
so , how' s the book ?
uh , it' s fine .
it' s done .
basically .
i got a little tinkering i' ve still got to do .
great !
i was hoping i could get a look at it sometime over the weekend .
it' s gonna be a little tough .
i' m at a critical juncture right now .
i thought you were just tinkering .
w well , i am , but i have little details i' ve got to work on .
i' m not gonna pressure you .
i just got off the plane .
i mean , i get pressure .
you know ?
i get
know what i mean ?
what the hell in the hootenanny do you suppose that would be ?
that would be a tuba .
you didn' t actually purchase this car , did you ?
no , i got it from jerry nathan .
he owed me some money .
ah !
he owes god money .
including my commission on that faux novel of his .
that perfume you' re wearing , antonia ... that wouldn' t happen to be cristalle , would it ?
um , uh , yes , it is .
how did you know ?
lucky guess .
the wordfest kickoff party ... was always held at sara and walter gaskell' s house .
she was the chancellor , which meant she oversaw the university .
her husband , dr. gaskell ... was the chairman of the english department ... which meant he oversaw me .
isn' t that a nice greenhouse ?
it' s mrs. gaskell' s .
it' s her hobby .
i thought you were mrs. gaskell' s hobby .
piss off , will you , crabs ?
i lost a wife today .
you' il find another .
she' il be young , beautiful .
they always are .
oh , hello , everyone .
terry , good to see you again .
chancellor .
don' t you look ravishing .
oh , oh .
easy .
i' m sorry , i' m sorry .
it' s these goddamn shoes .
i don' t know how anyone can walk in these things .
practice .
i don' t believe we' ve met .
antonia sloviak .
poe .
poe !
poe !
poe , stop !
poe !
that wouldn' t be walter' s dog , would it ?
poe !
who' s he barking at now ?
he ' s still barking at me .
he ' s blind .
stop this .
honestly .
excuse me , i need to talk to you for a second , chancellor .
i need to talk to you too .
maybe you could help me take these coats to the upstairs guest room .
i' d be happy to if i knew where the upstairs guest room was .
i could show you .
terry .
yeah .
oh , yeah .
we' il make ourselves at home .
we' il let poe show us around .
thanks .
that' s new , isn' t it ?
yeah , walter just got it back from the framer .
you first .
this morning  i' m pregnant .
i' m sure .
well , that' s that' s very surprising .
does walter know that , uh
i think walter would find this a little more than surprising .
emily left me this morning .
she' s left before .
she' s left the room before , but she' s always come back .
so .
i guess we just divorce our spouses , marry each other ... and have this baby , right ?
simple .
yeah , right .
simple .
is that cristalle ?
mm hmm .
oh , god .
i wear the same scent as a transvestite .
she is a transvestite , isn' t she ?
if she' s not now , terry' il make sure she is ... by the end of the evening .
has he asked you about the book yet ?
yes .
and ?
are you gonna tell him ?
no .
maybe .
i don' t know what i' m gonna do .
me either .
dimaggio ' s record ... for hits in consecutive games ... is probably the most impressive feat in all of sports ... and in my opinion , will never be broken .
come here , big guy .
his condition' s so sad .
yes , but even blind , he still gets around .
i don' t drink normally ... but this was turning out to be one fucked up day .
and now i found myself in close proximity to sara ' s husband ... and his dog , poe .
walter , i see you' ve met my friend .
oh , yes .
she' s charming .
despite his much vaunted harvard education ...
dr. walter gaskell didn' t have a clue about his wife and me .
simply put , di maggio represented metaphorically speaking , of course the husband as slugger .
poe had been on to me since day one .
in fact , i personally believe ... that every woman in some way desires to be marilyn monroe .
oh , i couldn' t agree more .
i' ve had a lot of successes over the years .
q. q was rich .
q was famous .
q completed a novel every 18 months .
i hated him . ... finest work vanished in less than five .
so i find myself conflicted .
ask him if he' s conflicted about his house in the hamptons .
grady .
well , professor .
q. for your information ...
hannah already has two stories published ... in the paris review , so you better dust off your " a " material .
you didn' t tell me you were a writer .
you didn' t ask .
how did you feel about the adaptation ?
i thought it was more literary than cinematic .
grady .
douglas triddley , amherst .
i' ve had arsonist ' s daughter ... on my graduate studies syilabus three years running .
no wonder it' s still in print .
long time since arsonist' s daughter .
there you are .
i could have sworn i had a bottle of 1975 lafite rothschild for q.
given that he' s going to be addressing 500 people ... in less than an hour
you want to keep q happy .
if he' s happy , i' m happy .
james ?
it' s fake .
it was my mother' s .
she won it in a penny arcade in baltimore ... when she went to catholic school .
well , that' s very convincing .
i used to shoot these little paper caps ... but they don' t make them anymore , the caps .
it' s just for good luck , you know ?
some people carry rabbit' s feet .
you carry firearms .
no , thank you .
i don' t like to lose control of my emotions .
i' m not supposed to be here , in case you' re wondering .
but the other night i was out with hannah at the movies ... and she asked me since she was coming , so i ended up coming too .
you and , uh , hannah , you' re seeing each other ?
no !
what gave you that idea ?
james , relax .
i' m not her father .
i just rent her a room .
she likes old movies like i do , that' s all .
what' s the movie you guys saw ?
son of fury ... with tyrone power and frances farmer .
she went crazy , frances farmer .
so did gene tierney .
she' s in it too .
sounds like a good one .
it wasn' t bad .
you' re not like my other teachers , prof. tripp .
you' re not like my other students , james .
look , james ... about this afternoon in workshop , i' m sorry .
i think i let things get a little out of hand .
they really hated it .
i think they hated it more than any of the other ones .
well  doesn' t matter .
it only took me an hour to write .
really ?
that' s remarkable .
i have trouble sleeping .
while i' m lying in bed , i figure them out , the stories .
you cold , james ?
oh , a little .
why don ' t we go inside ?
it' s colder in there .
i guess you' re right .
actually , i saw the greenhouse .
i thought i' d come outside and take a look at it .
it looks like heaven .
looks like heaven ?
i saw a movie once .
part of it took place in heaven .
everyone wore white .
lived in crystal houses like that .
i really should be going .
good bye , prof. tripp .
hey , james .
james , don' t go .
no .
there' s something i want you to see .
i' il miss my bus .
it' s worth it .
trust me .
let me help you with that .
thank you , dear .
thank you .
come on .
hey , you two .
james , are you riding with me ?
no , i' m going home  no , he' s going with me .
why don' t you take crabtree and his friend ?
all right ?
all right .
where are they anyway ?
here we are .
hmm .
well , hello there .
james , this is my editor , terry crabtree .
james .
james' il know about george sanders .
george sanders ?
mr. crabtree was saying ... how george sanders killed himself , only he couldn' t remember how .
pills .
april 25 , 1 972 , in a costa brava hotel room .
how comprehensive of you .
james is amazing .
he knows all the movie suicides .
go ahead , james .
tell him .
there are so many .
well , just a few .
the big ones .
pier angeli , 1971 or ' 72 , also pills .
donald " red " barry , shot himself in 1 980 .
charles boyer , 1978 , pills again .
charles butterworth , 1946 , i think .
in a car .
supposedly , it was an accident , but , you know , he was distraught .
dorothy dandridge , pills , 1965 .
albert dekker , 1968 .
he hung himself .
he wrote his suicide note in lipstick on his stomach .
william lnge , carbon monoxide , 1973 .
carole landis , pills again .
i forget when .
george reeves , " superman " on tv , shot himself .
jean seberg , pills , of course , 1 979 .
everett sloane he was good pills .
margaret sulla van , pills .
lupe velez , a lot of pills .
gig young , he shot himself and his wife in 1 978 .
there are tons more .
i haven' t heard of half of them .
you did them alphabetically .
it' s just how my bra in works , i guess .
fascinating .
come out with us after the lecture .
there' s this place i always get tripp to take me .
actually , i just want to go home .
don ' t be silly .
no one your age just wants to go home .
besides , faculty will be present .
just consider it a field trip .
ls that really it ?
that' s really it .
the one she wore on her wedding day .
so i' m told .
go ahead .
really ?
really .
she was small .
most people don' t know that .
the shoulders are so small .
it looks so perfect .
i bet it' s the only time she wore it .
that day .
she must have felt so happy .
must' ve cost dr. gaskell a lot .
i guess .
he also never tells sara the truth ... about how much he pays for these things .
you' re really good friends with the chancellor , aren' t you ?
pretty good .
i' m friends with her husband too .
i guess you must be if you know the combination to his closet ... and he doesn' t mind you being in here in their bedroom .
right .
drive carefully .
stick close to me in case it gets slippery .
we better skedaddle .
james [ sniffling ]
you all right , james ?
oh .
i' m sorry , prof. tripp .
maybe it' s ... seeing that jacket that belonged to her .
it just looks really lonely ... hanging there in a closet .
maybe i' m just a little sad tonight .
i' m a little sad tonight too , james .
you mean , with your wife leaving you and all ?
hannah mentioned something about it .
yeah , well , it' s complicated , james .
i think we should go now .
easy , easy .
he' s a good boy , poe .
poe' s a good boy .
easy , poe .
easy .
good dog .
jesus christ !
get off !
shit , james .
you shot dr. gaskell' s dog .
but l i had to , didn' t l ?
you could' ve pulled him off me .
no , the dog was crazy , prof. tripp .
the dog was attacking you !
calm down , james .
don' t freak out , all right ?
okay .
all right .
do you have a mirror ?
it' s the best way to see if someone' s still breathing .
the dog is dead , james .
believe me .
i know a dead dog when i see one .
oh , shit .
what are we supposed to do now ?
first , you' re gonna give me that little cap gun of yours .
come on .
prof. tripp , what are we gonna do with ... it ?
i don' t know .
i' m still trying to figure out ... how to tell the chancellor that i murdered her husband' s dog .
you ?
trust me , james .
when the family pet' s been assassinated ... the owner does not want to hear ... that one of her students was the triggerman .
does she wanna hear it was one of her professors ?
i' ve got tenure .
hang on .
it' s still warm .
let' s try feet first .
yuck !
that is a big trunk .
it holds a tuba , a suitcase ... a dead dog and a garment bag almost perfectly .
yep .
that' s just what they used to say in the ads .
come on , crabtree .
i know you' re holding .
whose tuba is that anyway ?
miss sloviak' s .
can i ask you something about her ?
yes , she is .
so is your friend crabtree
is he is he gay ?
most of the time he is , james .
some of the time he isn' t .
what do we have here ?
this looks like
that' s our old friend mr. codeine .
that should take the old pinch out of the ankle .
you want one ?
no , thanks .
i' m fine without them .
right .
that' s why you were standing in the chancellor' s backyard ... spinning that cap gun of yours .
you' re fine .
yeah , you' re just as fit as a fucking fiddle .
i' m sorry , james .
i' m sorry i said that .
how about we try that again ?
it is a great pleasure to introduce ... best selling author quentin morewood ... known to his friends simply as q.
i ... am a writer .
as a writer , you learn that everyone you meet has a story .
every bartender , every taxi driver ... has an idea that would make a great book .
presumably each of you has an idea .
but how do you get from there to here ?
what is the bridge from the water' s edge of inspiration ... to the far shore of accomplishment ?
faith .
faith that your story is worth the telling .
faith that you have the wherewithal to tell it .
and faith that the carefully woven structure that you create ... won ' t collapse beneath you .
and faith that when you get to the other side ... there will be someone waiting ... who gives a damn about the tale you have to tell .
i' il be back in a minute .
like whitman , i admit ...
i worship at the shrine of formal construction .
but like conrad , i confess that i have a secret sharer in my work .
my double , my other self .
i am haunted by this malignant , remorseless shadow
grady .
grady .
you had another one again , didn' t you ?
is the thing
is it over ?
almost .
wanna sit up ?
what' s wrong ?
nothing , i just twisted
sara , there' s something i' ve gotta tell you .
something hard .
stand up then .
i' m too old for all this rolling around on the floor .
give me a hand ?
well , this evening  don' t .
i know what you' re gonna say .
i don' t think you do know what i' m gonna say , sara .
you love emily .
of course you love emily .
she' s young , beautiful .
she' s your wife .
you have to stay with her .
b but i don' t have a choice .
emily left me .
she' il come back .
that' s why i' m going to [ softly ]
to not have this baby .
you' re not gonna have it ?
no , there' s no way .
i mean , don' t you think there' s no way ?
well , i don' t see any , but i know what it means to you .
no , you don' t .
and fuck you for saying you do , for saying that there' s no way .
because there could be a way , grady .
they must be finishing .
we should go .
whose gun is that ?
a souvenir from baltimore .
it' s heavy .
smells like [ sniffing ]
gunpowder .
caps .
pow .
you got me .
i love you , grady .
the doors made so much noise .
it was so embarrassing .
they had to carry him out .
is he all right ?
he' s fine .
he' s narrating .
they were going to the men' s room ... but would they make it in time ?
terry crabtree and james leer .
leave it to you to make that mistake .
wait here .
i need a ride .
i' m your man .
there' s an explanation .
couldn' t he have just thrown a shoe at the poor thing ?
antonia , listen  tony .
now that i' m home .
tony ...
i' m sorry tonight didn' t work out the way you' d hoped to with terry .
forget it .
your friend is just ...
i don' t know , into collecting weird tricks .
i think he' d call it a habit .
i do get the feeling he' s going through the motions a little bit .
you mean because his career is ruined and all ?
is that what he told you ?
he said he hasn' t had a success in over five years , and ... everyone in new york thinks he' s kind of a loser .
but he said he' s sure your book' s so good that ... he' il be able to keep his job .
and you' re not one of those writers who has a success and then ... freezes up and never has another one .
you can turn here .
gotta go .
i think i may have to rescue james leer .
you know , grady , maybe ... you should think about going home .
you look like you need a little rescuing yourself .
@@ [ r& b ]
hey , grady .
how are you ?
can i get a double dickel on the rocks , please ?
i' m right over here .
double dickel .
is that just beer ?
primarily .
although i gather that the two of you staged a little raid ... on the crabtree pharmacopoeia .
so where is everybody ?
sara and walter declined .
i guess they just wanted ... to go home and curl up on the couch with poe .
jesus , he' s out .
he has a book .
i know .
he started it in fall semester .
finished it winter break .
so is he any good ?
no , not yet he isn' t .
well , i' m gonna read it anyway .
oh , crabs , come on , will ya ?
he' s one of my students , for christ' s sakes .
besides , i' m not sure if he' s , uh  he is .
i' m sure .
take my word for it .
i see myself in him .
i' m sure you do , but it' s a little more complicated than that .
besides , he' s a little scattered right now .
he almost did something really stupid tonight .
i don' t think he needs sexual confusion ... to mix up the stew a little more .
on the contrary , i think it might be just the ticket .
double dickel on the rocks .
oola " ?
thanks , oola .
cheers .
cheers .
oh , my goodness .
do you see what i see ?
look there .
let ' s go .
you first .
president of the james brown hair club for men .
he' s a boxer .
a flyweight .
no , no , he' s a jockey .
his name is curtis hard apple .
not curtis .
okay then , vernon .
vernon hardapple .
the scars are from a horse .
he fell during a race .
he got trampled .
he' s addicted to painkillers .
he can' t even piss standing up anymore .
lives with his mother .
that' s right .
and he' s got a younger brother who' s a
who' s a groom named claudelle .
yeah .
his mother blames vernon for claudelle ' s death .
great !
because because
because  because why ?
he was killed when a gangster named freddy nostrils ... tried to shoot his favorite horse .
claudelle took the bullet himself .
vernon , over there ... was in on the hit .
that was good .
yeah , he heard everything we said .
come on , teach .
i want you to dance with me .
no .
come on .
so i' ve been rereading arsonist' s daughter .
it' s so beautiful , grady .
it' s so natural .
it' s like all of your sentences always existed , just ... waiting for up there in style heaven for you to fetch them down .
i thank you .
and i love the inscription you wrote to me .
only i' m not quite the downy innocent you think i am .
i hope that' s not true .
we need all the downy innocents we can get .
@ and it ' s time to go @ @ i need your love so bad @@
what this boy could use is a nice , tall coca cola .
let me help .
no , we got him .
i' il meet you two at the car .
oh , i see .
all right .
well , give me the keys to the trunk .
i gotta get my property out of there .
the trunk' s a little sticky , crabs .
i gotta do it .
whatever .
professor ...
tripp .
hannah , when you get james back to his apartment ... make sure he' s all right before you leave , okay ?
i would if i knew where i was taking him .
are you telling me you don' t know where james lives ?
some apartment somewhere .
i' ve never seen it .
that strikes me as very odd .
james is odd .
i know his aunt lives in sewickley heights .
i dropped him there once .
come to think of it , it wasn' t his aunt' s house .
he said she worked there or something .
i don' t remember .
i need my knapsack .
what' s he saying ?
his bag .
you know that ugly green thing he' s always carrying around ?
he must' ve left it inside .
aw , shit .
he left it at thaw .
the auditorium .
knapsack !
all right .
let him crash at my house .
where should i put him ?
in the shape that he' s in , you could stand him up ... in the garage next to the snow shovels , and he' d be all right .
grady , if you wanna talk later ...
i' il be up .
hey , guy !
tripp , the trunk .
you' re killing me .
i' m gonna get it !
killin ' me !
you drivin ' this car ?
excuse me ?
this 1 966 maroon ford galaxy 500 .
you drivin ' this car ?
this is my car .
bullshit !
it ' s mine , motherfucker !
i' m afraid you' re mistaken .
bullshit !
who is that ?
oh , vernon , go home to your mother , will you ?
what are you lookin ' at ?
i' m lookin ' at you , fella .
hit it , will you ?
come on , killjoy , go !
can we go now , den mother ?
what' s with you ?
i wonder .
come on , crabs .
the kid was comatose .
who started that ?
i was trying to calm him down .
oh , yeah , you calmed him down , dr. feelgood .
grady !
hit the brakes !
stop the car !
stop !
hey !
what' s his problem ?
back up !
get out of the car !
hey !
go around , go around him .
i' m stopping you !
i don' t think so !
come back here !
what' s this ?
it ' s a one way , guy .
go , go , go !
look out !
he ' s back !
now what ?
you owe him a book too ?
you could always drive over him .
what the hell was that ?
i just got my hood jumped on .
wait here .
i' il be right back .
where would we go ?
hold on a second .
prof. tripp .
i guess you' re here for the backpack .
it' s traxler .
sam .
i saw the manuscript inside , so when you showed up i figured
the love parade .
so it was true .
the little prick had finished his book .
is it good ?
i don' t know .
it might be .
so there it was .
somewhere in the night a manhattan book editor ... was prowling the streets of pittsburgh ... best selling author at his side ... dead dog in his trunk .
say , prof. tripp .
is all that stuff true about errol flynn ?
how he used to put paprika on his dick ... to make it , you know , like ... more stimulating for the chick ?
christ , traxler , how the hell should i know ?
you' re reading his biography , aren' t you ?
oh .
no , it' s true .
he used to rub all sorts of things on it .
salad dressing , ground lamb .
sick .
whenever i wondered what sara saw in me ... and i wondered more than once ...
i always came back to the fact that she loved to read .
she read everything , every spare moment .
she was a junkie for the printed word .
and lucky for me ...
i manufactured her drug of choice .
ls that your wife ?
no , my wife' s out of town .
what exactly are we doing here ...
prof. tripp ?
taking the long way home .
take it easy , prof. tripp .
thanks for the ride .
i told myself ...
i needed to put everything aside for the moment .
emily , sara , the purloined jacket ... and the dead dog , and work on my book .
it was started out as a small book .
probably about , oh , 250 , 300pages .
it had gotten a little larger in scope .
and the ending , it kept getting further away .
but the ending was there .
i knew it .
i could almost see it .
james ?
i' m okay .
i just lost my balance .
i put you on the floor .
oh .
thank you .
i thought you might swallow your tongue or something .
i guess you must really miss her , huh ?
hmm ?
oh , this .
no .
no , i just write in this .
this wasn' t emily' s .
i guess there' s probably a story behind that .
there is , but it' s not very interesting .

i' il drive .
let me get this straight .
jerry nathan owes you money ... so as collateral , he gives you his car .
only i' m beginning to think that the car ...
wasn' t exactly jerry' s to give .
ah , so whose car was it ?
my guess ?
vernon hard apple .
the hood jumper ?
he said a few things that lead me to believe that the car was his .
such as ?
" that' s my car , motherfucker .
all right , so we find vernon , we find the car .
we find the car  we find the jacket .
wow .
christ !
how' d you know , tripp ?
oh , i don' t know .
let' s just call it a hunch .
i call it genius .
good to know i' m still talented at something .
careful .
keep that motor running .
i know you .
double dickel on the rocks .
oola .
i never forget a drink .
i never forget an oola .
forget me ?
vernon ?
go inside , cupcake .
he' s got a gun .
who' s got a gun ?
you' ve got a gun !
drop it !
uh oh .
vernon , relax .
why is he calling you vernon ?
why is he sitting in my car ?
he' s crazy , that' s why !
he probably calls everybody vernon .
now drop that gun !
oh , dear .
it' s a souvenir .
they don' t even have caps for this thing .
it' s a souvenir .
bullshit !
i know a gun when i see one , and that' s a gun !
no !
no , really  [ gunshot ]
oh , god !
oh !
gimme that gun !
are you crazy ?
can' t you see the condition my girl' s in ?
get out !
get out !
hey !
stop !
cupcake , you okay ?
tripp , run !
who in the hell is that ?
oh , shit !
vernon , don ' t no !
don ' t shoot !
oh , no !
don' t !
don' t shoot !
come on , tripp !
jump in !
run !
he' s a crazy man .
oh , my god .
i take it back .
shoot him .
naturally , you have copies .
i have an alternate version of the first chapter .
you' il be all right , then .
look at
look at carlyle when he lost his luggage .
that was macaulay .
oh .
well , what about hemingway when hadley lost all those stories ?
he was never able to reproduce them .
look , tripp , i don' t wanna depreciate the loss here ... but maybe , you know , in a sense , it' s for the best .
you suggesting it ' s some kind of sign ?
in a sense .
in my experience ... signs are usually a little more subtle .
let me get this straight .
all that paper that blew away back there ... that was the only copy ?
i' m afraid so , yes .
and you , you' re saying that it' s some kind of a sign ?
man , what in the fuck the matter with you ?
don' t .
all i' m saying is that sometimes , subconsciously ... a person will put themselves in a situation ... perhaps even create that situation ... in order to have an arena in which to work out an unresolved issue .
it' s a covert way , if you will , of addressing a problem .
i' il tell you the problem .
you behind the wheel , there' s your problem .
did you or did you not have a gun to his head ?
watch the road , please .
he was trying to steal my car .
did you or did you not have a gun to his head ?
all right !
all right !
that' s enough !
that is enough !
what is done is done !
i don' t wanna hear about it anymore , okay ?
so what was it about , your book ?
what was the story ?
i don' t know .
what he means is ... it' s difficult to distill the essence of a book sometimes ... because it lives in the mind .
but you got to know what it was about , right ?
if you didn' t know what it was about , why were you writing it ?
i couldn' t stop .
vernon , can i ask you a question ?
boy or girl ?
as long as it looks like her ...
i really don' t care .
you
you know what i' m saying ?
yeah .
thanks for the ride , vernon .
anytime .
and another thing .
yeah ?
stop calling me vernon .
okay .
jacket , tripp .
what ?
we need the jacket .
oh , right .
oola , about that jacket
yeah .
it used to belong to marilyn monroe .
really ?
mm hmm .
she had small shoulders ... just like you .
a lot of people don ' t know that .
thank you .
man , that book of yours must have been one nutty ride .
come on , baby .
let' s go .
would you mind explaining to me what you just did ?
came to my senses .
oh .
congratulations .
meanwhile , what' s james supposed to do ?
pray that walter gaskell comes to his ?
walter gaskell doesn' t wanna send james leer to jail .
he' s up in his office right now .
he' s talking to his parents , local police ... trying to find a solution .
tripp , the least they' re gonna do is expel him .
it doesn' t matter .
that' s very enlightening , professor .
it' s comforting to know that america' s children ... have you for a teacher .
nobody teaches a writer anything .
you tell' em what you know .
you tell' em to find their voice and stay with it .
you tell the ones that have it to keep at it .
you tell the ones that don' t have it to keep at it too ... because that' s the only way they' re gonna get to where they' re going .
of course , it does help if you know where you wanna go .
helping my students figure that out ... that and sara ... that' s what' s made these last years worthwhile .
as for james , well , he doesn' t really need me anymore .
he' s got you .
me ?
what can i do ?
oh , i don' t know , crabs .
improvise .
you' re pretty good at that .
tripp .
i' m sorry .
improvise .
as for me , i was through improvising .
i knew what i had to do .
i had to find sara .
i had to convince her that she was my choice ... that , in fact , she had been from the very beginning .
and now , as those of you who' ve been with us in previous years know ... we have a tradition of sorts here at wordfest .
i' m speaking , of course , of the plums ... those fortunate local writers ... who have successfully placed their manuscripts ... with visiting publishers ' representatives .
this weekend , susan lowery of north braddock ... found a publisher for her children ' s book ...
the loneliest prawn .
stand up , susan .
no w , this next one is , i think , very exciting to announce ... because it concerns a student here at the university .
our own james leer ... sophomore in english literature ... has found a publisher for his first novel ... which i believe is called ...
the lovely parade .
love parade .
love parade .
james ?
stand up .
go on .
he ' s a real alien probe , if you know what i mean .
take a bow , james !
wonder boy .
and finally , and perhaps not least importantly ...
terry crabtree of bartizan has also decided to publish my own book ... a critical exploration of the union of joe dimaggio ... and marilyn monroe ... and its function in american mythopoetics ... which , tentatively , i have entitled ...
the last american marriage .
so , until next year , thank you , everyone .
grady , i took another look ... at the arsonist' s daughter the other night .
that description of the bald cypress left me breathless .
thanks , q.
i appreciate that .
sara !
@@ [ humming ]
yo , traxler .
hey , prof. tripp .
you get high , sam ?
only when i' m workin ' .
holy shit .
are you serious ?
careful there , prof. tripp .
whoa .
i didn' t fall .
not then , not ever again .
once the monongahela river swallowed my never ending opus ... there were no more spells .
james leer didn' t get expelled or go to jail ... thanks to crabtree ' s wheeling and dealing .
but he quit anyway , went to new york ... to rework his novel for publication .
hannah green has decided to take a position as a junior editor ... when she graduates .
and crabtree , well , crabtree ' s gone right on being crabtree .
as for me , i lost everything . : my wife , my book , my job ... everything that i thought was important .
but i finally knew where i wanted to go .
