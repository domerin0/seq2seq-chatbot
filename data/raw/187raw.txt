chill !
chill !
sayonara , baby .
now , this guy' s a major sleazebag .
you' re the second girl today .
i don' t know what he does with them , so just expect to expect .
when you' re getting ready , you' il naturally want to let your hair down .
okay ?
so you just pull out this pin .
it' s a radio transmitter with a range of 30 feet to cover a whole room .
don' t leave it in the kitchen or the bedroom .
drop it where he does his business ... ... where he takes his meetings and makes his calls , right ?
it' s very important i get to know who he' s talking to and what about .
all right .
when you get to that point of no return , excuse yourself .
you go to the ladies ' room , you pop one of these pills to induce vomiting .
it' il only last a half a minute .
but no man will want you around ... ... if he thinks you' re gonna throw up during orgasm .
okay ?
it' il be a piece of cake .
hell of a way to start a career , huh ?
or to end one .
look , seiko ....
maybe you shouldn' t go .
no , i volunteered .
i can do this .
i' m fine .
really .
i' m at your command , mr. grant .
okay , looks like we' re on .
redo her lips .
okay , let' s go .
you' re taking a big chance with a rookie .
yeah ?
do i look worried ?
you should .
the three strikes rule applies to both sides of the law .
yeah , well , a well timed home run can wipe the slate clean .
you' re certainly due one .
i certainly am .
all right .
we' re on the elevator .
sushi again ?
eat one now , hungry in an hour .
let' s go to work .
let me know if we miss a spot .
for god' s sake , keep calm .
what is this japanese basket fuck bullshit ?
it' s not real , it' s a bloody myth .
you mean , where the woman ... ... is strapped to a hanging bamboo basket ... ... slowly lowered onto her lover' s erect penis ... ... as the basket spins ?
yeah .
it' s not a myth .
i like this girl .
okay , okay .
come on .
we haven' t done any father and son thing in years .
what are you talking about ?
it' s just an hour drive .
we can be up at griffith lake by noon .
what do i get out of it ?
fresh air , scenery , nature .
shitloads of nature .
what am i gonna do with nature ?
you need this .
i know i do .
yeah , be just like old times .
what' s in the lake ?
bass .
got any catfish ?
catfish ?
sure , catfish .
trout , you know it .
just drop in a line , you' re bound to snag something .
even an old geezer like you .
shut your mouth , victor .
i' m not an old geezer .
you' il be eating fresh meat for a month .
i hate the way fish smells .
i hate the way it smells too , but we' il just box up what we catch ... ... and ship it back .
i' m pretty good at crating things up .
sure .
maybe next time you should just belt him .
hey , look , you do things your way .
subtlety' s not my style .
who do you think you' re talking to ?
guys with style draw a lot of attention ... ... even when they go fishing with their fathers .
so what' s it gonna be ?
of course they' il be with me .
my scalps are always with me .
i' m busy .
you sure ?
next time .
yeah .
have fun .
fathers .
i must say ... ... the japanese do get a few things right .
no , no , no .
stay there .
that' s the perfect position to start .
may i please use your restroom ?
don' t keep me waiting .
here we go .
here we go .
now drop the pin and take the pill .
come on .
drop the fucking pin and take the pill .
something' s wrong .
no signal .
she may be in trouble .
i' m going up .
brodie , get me emergency services .
got it .
hello .
come on .
let' s see who the master race is .
seiko ?
seiko ?
hey , hey .
seiko , it' s grant .
put the gun down .
come on .
so ... ?
gun' s away .
all right ... ... just tell me what happened .
no !
eight people are dead because of this screwup !
you had no business choosing an untested officer for this mission .
if you' d followed procedures , none of this would have happened .
because of your lack of respect for the law ... ... this department is now being called the kgb .
it wasn' t a good time to page me .
they were locking the gate , zack .
someone got hurt today , didn' t they ?
someone got hurt ?
why do you say that ?
you' re usually late when someone gets hurt .
yeah , someone died .
did you kill them ?
no .
good .
partly my responsibility , though .
like when i cleaned the paintbrush in seymour' s milk bowl ?
similar .
you got mad at me for that .
right .
is the fbi mad at you ?
extremely .
are you gonna lose your job ?
i don' t know , eric .
i guess it depends on how well i do over the next few days .
all right ?
want to hear a joke ?
yeah , sure .
what do you call a mule that needs a shave ?
a hairy ass .
i don' t think so .
that' s a curse word .
bet that troublemaker told you that .
teacher called his dad again .
yeah ?
i' m surprised he has one .
come on , zack .
everyone has a father ... ... even the bullies .
appears to be a 9mm , wide tip with a blunted casing ... ... deformed upon impact with the lower sternum .
another shell is wedged between the third and fourth vertebrae ... ... partially severing the spinal cord .
left ventricle punctured by a third ...
... and fourth fragment .
right ventricle destroyed by a fifth .
pelvic bone shattered .
scrotum and testicles no longer attached to the torso .
someone was in charge .
i want his name .
breaking in a new partner ?
sitter' s not ready till 5 .
hey , eric , let' s feel that grip , boy .
come on .
find anything ?
no closet full of hockey masks .
the girl was a landlord' s dream .
clean , neat , no wild parties .
it' s always the quiet ones that snap .
seiko did not snap .
no , she gunned down seven people in a fit of happiness .
eric .
look , zack , it' s been a rough day .
take your son to the park .
play some catch .
come on .
supe wants us to handle this .
you know how it is .
what happened ?
where' s seiko ?
if you don' t mind me asking ... ... how did she die ?
in the line of duty .
oh , my god .
what ?
that was one of her biggest fears .
what do you mean ?
she had a lot of bad dreams about getting killed on the job .
really scared her sometimes .
she wouldn' t want to sleep alone , so
she' d come over to my place .
i' d make her rice krispy squares .
she kept her groceries in my fridge ... ... used my shower ... ... my phone .
she called from here ?
i sure don' t know anyone in new york .
you think the phone company screwed up ?
the phone company ?
yeah , maybe .
look , why don' t i keep these .
i' il check it out for you , all right ?
thanks .
fbi vs. at& t. i' d pay money to see that on pay per view .
i gotta go .
seven calls .
seven calls to this guy .
yuji kobayashi .
yakuza .
you see , the way it appears to me , fukes ... ... is seiko could not possibly be working alone .
she was coerced by the yakuza .
this is all circumstantial at best .
i know that .
but if i can get him to admit his connection with seiko ... ... then at the least , we got ourselves a prime suspect .
the heat' s off the department .
and you .
okay , zack , i' il give you some rope .
but if you hang yourself with it ... ... l can' t cut you loose .
i understand .
go get him .
he was an obsessive child ... ... always striving to achieve the impossible .
he would have exceeded my accomplishments ... ... but he chose his own path .
he was your leader .
he was my son .
we will miss him .
i want zack grant followed wherever he goes .
either he leads us to the scum responsible for victor' s death ... ... or my loss ... ... will become his .
sir ?
sir ?
yeah .
your seat belt .
what about it ?
it must be fastened before takeoff .
we' re still at the gate .
but the pilot' s turned on the " fasten seat belt " sign .
until the pilot turns on the engines ... ... there' s not much chance of me falling out of my seat .
still , it is an airline regulation .
i' il risk it , okay ?
okay .
charming , grant .
you' il have no problem convincing the yakuza ... ... that you' re a typical american gun dealer .
unrefined and egotistical .
fortunately , you don' t speak japanese ... ... which means once we' re inside , i' il be running the show .
sure we' il get in ?
as an avid art collector myself ... ... i know what kobayashi will appreciate .
trust me , we' il get in .
0 to 60 in 3 .
2 seconds .
we start the bidding at 35 , 000 .
that' s item 1 12 .
i make the first move .
unfortunately , many japanese still cling to clichs about americans .
what , that we' re all loud mouthed , two faced sons of bitches ?
sorry .
that' s okay .
americans think japanese are ... ... stone faced , tight assed , rip off merchants .
it' s a good thing we' re both above all that .
yeah .
friendly guy .
he' s a baby .
that' s the fish oil .
matching tattakanese swords .
our gift to you .
they are very rare .
accept them in the spirit of our pending relationship .
our relationship ?
what does that mean ?
my friend is with the military .
you got any money to lose ?
what are you playing ?
japanese five card .
your deal .
any of you play guts ?
guts ?
please ... who referred you to me ?
i may want to reward him .
he was a " she .
we each get three cards , you make your best hand .
three of a kind is tops .
take a chip ... ... and put it under the table .
she works for you .
i have no female operatives .
if you' re in , you keep the chip in your palm .
if you' re out , you don' t .
but if you stay in and you lose ... ... you gotta match the pot .
okay ?
that' s guts .
what was her name ?
seiko .
you take the chip in your palm .
so you remember her now ?
please tell me .
i will tell you two things i am sure of ...
seiko did not send you to me .
... and you' re not a gun dealer .
put your hands under the table .
i' m very sorry ... ... i' ve taken your time .
who are you ?
get out , gim !
go !
gim , go !
fbl !
lower your guns !
i' m just gonna have a little talk with your boss here , okay ?
you can' t fuck with the united states government , asshole !
but no backup at all ?
what the fuck were you guys doing ?
yeah , i got him right here , no thanks to you .
i want a battalion when i bring him in , all right ?
nothing left to chance , okay ?
you' ve made a big mistake .
arresting you or saving your ass ?
you led them here .
this is your fault .
you killed serlano' s son and i' m the bad guy ?
i don' t think so .
i have done nothing wrong .
save your english .
it sucks .
your career is over .
no , you' re wrong there .
my career' s just started , i' il tell you that right now .
who the fuck is that ?
hello ?
what do you call a mule that needs a shave ?
who is this ?
serlano .
senior .
i had nothing to do with your son .
maybe not , but because of some impressive luck on your part ... ... you have the prime suspect .
i want him to stand trial ... ... before me .
my career' s shot full of holes already .
this is your son we' re talking about , zack .
you understand me ?
your son .
don' t you fucking touch him .
it' s all up to you , zack .
up to you .
problems ?
a private auction was the site of a full scale gun battle this evening .
fbi special agent , gim takakura ... ... was involved in the shootout inside .
yeah ?
what do you mean , he hasn' t shown up ?
where else could he have gone ?
ladies and gentlemen , welcome aboard flight 51 1 , nonstop to los angeles .
it' s about 4 1/ 2 hours in , so sit back and enjoy your flight .
can i get you a cocktail ?
no .
how about you , sir ?
no .
i was talking to the other gentleman .
he doesn' t want anything .
wine , please .
chardonnay .
kiwi with that ?
kiwi ?
very refreshing .
the fuzz tickles your throat .
i' il be right back .
don' t fuck with me .
i would say the fucking is coming from you , mr. grant .
you may arrest me , but i' m not a convict .
in fact , you' il be apologizing to me very soon .
yeah , i think you' re right .
i' m sorry .
you know , i don' t give a shit about serlano .
someone was bound to put that demented fuck down .
but seiko ... ... that girl had everything going for her .
so how' d you get her to do it ?
what ?
you threaten to kill her ?
what ?
yeah , right .
save it for your defense .
that' s where all the bullshit gets flung .
your chardonnay .
and your peeled kiwi .
seedless ?
actually , the kiwi is a seed bearing fruit .
i spooned them out .
very thoughtful .
thank you .
anything else ?
i' il have a pumpkin with a happy face .
trouble in paradise ?
the guy in 9 c. typical sub b type .
i tried courtesy , small talk , a sincere and inviting smile .
well , this isn' t training .
these are real people .
personalities go ape shit when people get stressed out .
for all we know , this guy could have an incredible fear of flying .
sometimes the best thing is just to leave him alone .
look .
in the last 30 years there have been 25 million auto related fatalities ... ... compared with only 3000 caused by airline disasters .
most of those can be traced to bad weather conditions .
since it' s summer and we' re nowhere near a thunderstorm ... ... there' s no reason to be afraid of flying .
what you' re really feeling is the fear of the unknown .
does that make sense ?
i am not afraid to fly .
very good .
i mean , i' m not afraid of flying .
then your rude behavior and total lack of respect for me ... ... is your natural personality and not due to stress ?
okay , you' re right .
i' m stressed out .
i sure hope so .
otherwise we both just made big fools of ourselves .
you should be sleeping .
i can' t .
you could if you turned this light out .
i don' t want to sleep .
okay ?
okay .
sam .
sam .
look into my eyes .
you' re doing great , sam .
look at me , baby .
zack .
come on , mrs. grant , big push .
one last push .
sam , come on !
push !
that' s it .
there he is .
mrs. grant , you have a boy !
pulse dropping !
sam !
what' s wrong ?
what' s wrong ?
what are you doing to her ?
get him out of here !
get him away !
what are you doing ?
we have to let them do their job !
stay here .
stay with us !
stay !
again !
come on , one more time .
give me 50 more right away .
right away .
we lost her .
shouldn' t fall asleep on the job .
too much at stake if you botch this assignment .
why isn' t he cuffed ?
who are you ?
i' m mr. serlano' s contingency plan .
if anything goes wrong , i take over .
and then all deals are off .
i' il bring him in like i said .
get the fuck out of my face .
foreigners .
ladies and gentlemen , sorry to wake you ... ... but we' il be experiencing turbulence .
i' d ask that you remain seated with your seat belts fastened .
we should pass through this quickly .
too much chardonnay .
there is another restroom around the corner , sir .
i' il wait for this one .
mary was right , you are an odd one .
she should talk .
give her a break , she' s new up here .
lack of experience isn' t her problem .
she' d be annoying anywhere .
land , sea or air .
have a cup of coffee .
it' il help wash down that foot in your mouth .
i smell fresh brewed .
i' il bring you back a cup .
that' s okay , i' m here .
i' il have one now .
cream and sugar ?
black .
shit !
it' s a gun !
where is the cockpit ?
oh , i don' t think
shoot me .
stop .
what the hell do you think you' re doing ?
you can' t come in
this is a hijack .
yuji !
where do you want to go ?
down .
now !
you' re digging yourself a hole .
this won' t win you any points with a judge .
enough lies !
you pretend to be a lawman while working for the mafia .
i was never to see a real judge .
i was to be executed by a man who does not care of my innocence or guilt !
your dishonesty is the real crime here , agent grant .
the only reason this plane will never make it to los angeles !
is there a code ?
no , it' s from the inside .
we better radio for an emergency landing .
no radio .
just land .
there' s a storm system down there !
land !
we' re making an emergency landing .
be sure all carryons are
there' s a small field 0 . 2 degrees to the south .
how small ?
i don' t want to die !
okay .
we' re down .
hey , you guys okay ?
boy , that was some kind of flying !
now what ?
get out of the way .
the hatch .
he took mary .
you want to untie me ?
hey !
what is it ?
it' s zack .
zack ?
where is he ?
arizona .
what the hell' s he doing in arizona ?
hijack ?
ma' am ?
we found him .
hey !
hello !
are my feet glad to see you !
you okay ?
didn' t want to be charged with kidnapping , so he dumped me !
stay here .
stay here .
you can' t just leave me ... ... here .
we' re out of here !
step away from the car .
i don' t think you' re going anywhere .
excuse me .
step away from the car .
thank you .
oh , shit .
okay , i gotcha .
i gotcha .
good decision .
all right , no more bullshit , no more bathroom privileges .
we' re driving straight through .
we' re walking straight through .
your father make puzzles with you ?
no .
you could do a puzzle by yourself .
i don' t understand that .
i used to make these with my son .
my dad' s job is very important .
oh , is that right ?
very important ?
mr. serlano !
well , so is mine !
mr. serlano , phone call !
yeah , all right , all right !
hold your horses !
yeah .
what the hell are you talking about ?
how could he get away from you ?
no .
no , no , no .
you just stay there .
the scouts are on their way .
he had his chance .
now it' s my turn .
how much is serlano paying you ?
for a man to turn bad , it must be a lot .
i could offer you more .
no , you couldn' t .
then it' s not money .
shut up .
why am i being treated like this ?
karma .
you do shit , then shit happens to you .
i did not hire seiko !
no ?
she decides to give a stranger a call before going on a killing spree ?
i don' t think so .
stay in fucking front of me .
she wanted yakuza' s help .
yeah ?
i couldn' t give it to her .
she went after victor herself .
yeah , right .
why would seiko want victor serlano dead ?
revenge .
i should have thought of that .
why won' t you believe me ?
in my experience , criminals have a moral problem with honesty .
i' m telling you the truth .
i don' t give a shit .
you' re serlano' s problem now , not mine , okay ?
i' m tired of your bullshit !
i know you had serlano killed !
admit it !
start spilling your guts or i' il spill them for you .
i' ve already told you the truth .
tell me !
tell me you had him killed !
i didn' t .
this is your last chance .
you tell me or your life is over .
i did not kill serlano' s son .
is this a bonding moment or what ?
mr. contingency wins again .
i' il take that .
careful .
expensive .
come on !
very good , zack .
i didn' t think you' d catch him , but you did .
you know , you should be kissing my ass .
if i hadn' t come along , our little import might' ve escaped .
at least now your kid has a fifty fifty chance .
what do you mean fifty fifty ?
he gave me his word .
provided you brought his man in .
you didn' t .
i did .
it shouldn' t change anything .
i don' t make the rules .
i want to talk to serlano .
sorry .
this is fucked .
don' t worry , zack .
mr. serlano really likes your boy .
if things don' t go your way , he might adopt him as his own .
wouldn' t that be ironic ?
guy you' ve been trying to nail for five years ... ... becomes the father of your son ?
sounds like a fucking greek tragedy .
radio that we have them .
tell the copter to pick us up ... ... there .
have the main unit meet us at eagle rock .
got it .
eagle rock .
we' re gonna take a trip now .
if there' s any trouble from any of you ... ... l will shoot you all .
those are my orders .
i don' t understand .
it' s easy .
i point the gun , i pull the trigger .
how can you kill three people just because some guy tells you to ?
how do you get to carnegie hall ?
practice , practice , practice .
dusty trail !
we got a car coming !
drop it !
fbl !
put them down !
keep your beat on them !
we just want grant and yuji kobayashi .
sure , zack , go ahead .
take yuji with you .
come on , zack .
zack ?
i can' t .
what ?
which side are you on ?
get over here !
hey , i made my choice .
don' t do this , zack .
you can' t get away .
yes , he can .
help , somebody !
fbl ?
zack !
drive !
me ?
i' m not a fugitive !
drive the goddamn car !
but i can' t see a thing !
go !
go !
go !
oh , no !
out of the car !
oh , shit !
go !
go !
go !
shit !
good job .
good job ?
this is not my job !
i' m not a getaway driver !
it was a compliment .
your hair looks pretty , " that' s a compliment !
i don' t want to be good at this !
you do .
i don' t !
yes , you do .
in this business you' il live longer .
this business ?
the hostage business ?
he' s not exactly my hostage .
what would you call him ?
my problem .
we got a lot of problems .
tell me about it .
fasten your seat belt , please .
listen here  something' s going on .
i don' t know what' s going on .
fukes is crying .
i swear .
no , she wasn' t .
agent dundreff ?
yes , ma' am .
put out an all points bulletin for the arrest of agent grant .
he' s to be considered extremely dangerous and be treated as such .
that' s absurd .
that' s zack we' re talking about .
just do it .
so how old is he ?
your son .
second grade .
seven .
oh , that' s a cute age .
love to see a picture of him .
i don' t have any .
you lost your wallet ?
i don' t have any photos of him .
none ?
no .
not one ?
no .
can we drop this ?
shut up .
shut up !
can you be quiet , just for a few miles ?
i' m upset .
so ?
i hum when i' m upset .
well , don' t .
perhaps you should try it .
i don' t want to .
music is a very powerful ally .
it soothes the savage beast .
go find yourself some bears to serenade .
i don' t want to hear it .
typical sub b.
that' s it .
you want to cuss me out ?
enough with the letters .
use whole words !
they' re not cuss words .
they' re personality types .
we' re taught how to spot problem passengers ... ... which i' m afraid you are " on land , sea or air " !
sorry i called you annoying .
what was going through my head ?
you' re an absolute joy .
i don' t believe that .
what ?
i sense sarcasm in your apology .
really ?
yes .
it' s upsetting .
oh , i' m sorry .
i am sorry .
i' m completely , without exception ... ... the fucking sorriest i' ve ever been in my whole fucking sorry life !
okay ?
i can accept that .
good .
yuji !
put the brakes on !
put the fucking brakes on !
see what your goddamn humming does ?
you son of a bitch !
put the fucking brakes on , you piece of shit !
shit !
fuck it !
shit !
you son of a bitch !
you prick .
i don' t care what he said .
i' m not the one screwing around .
i got him .
you want him or not ?
look , serlano , we had a deal , all right ?
so where is he ?
you get yuji when i get my son .
now you' re suddenly a father ?
hi .
chardonnay ?
not quite .
but it' s cold .
thank you .
you are very thoughtful .
it' s the training .
he is planning my death .
i don' t believe that .
i mean , i know he' s stubborn and rude ... ... but he' s a good person .
so am l .
i' m sure .
when you' re not hijacking 747s and all .
zack' s son is in danger .
that would drive any parent crazy .
i agree .
i' d probably make the same mistake .
mistake ?
i' il be at your place around noon .
no , zack , that won' t do .
we' il meet at griffith lake , outside of barstow .
griffith lake .
eric and i are going on a fishing trip .
oh , and , zack , you be there at 8 a . m ... ... or it won' t be worms i' il be using as bait .
that may not be enough time .
it better be .
yeah , right .
i finished that puzzle for you .
how' s the car ?
shot .
can she fix it ?
no .
i guess we' il have to borrow hers .
are you really turning yuji over to the mafia ?
it' s " yuji " now ?
even he said you don' t believe he killed this guy' s son .
do you ?
are you 1 00 percent sure ?
he' s a member of the yakuza .
he' s bound to be guilty of something .
you' re sentencing him to die !
if i don' t do this , i' m sentencing my son !
you choose .
that' s the way life is .
we' re losing her !
do you mind my asking ... ... why you don' t have photos of your son ?
every time i look at him , i think of his mother .
where is she ?
she' s dead .
it' s been , like , seven years now .
i' m sorry .
you know , i once served a medium rare swiss steak ... ... to patrick stewart .
who' s patrick stewart ?
patrick stewart .
picard .
the greatest starship captain that ever lived ?
what about captain james t. kirk ?
old news !
what ?
you' re shunning the guy who went first where no man had gone before .
he was a d type , sub a.
he kicked klingon ass , babe .
he always broke the prime directive .
picard never breaks it .
he' s an old bald guy .
he couldn' t break a date .
for pete' s sake , grow up !
grow up ?
i don' t believe you sometimes .
how about you , yuji ?
who do you think was best ?
yeah , right .
ask him .
sulu .
sulu ?
he should' ve been captain .
what should i do ?
oh , shit .
we can' t outrun him in this .
you better pull over .
you got your i. d. ?
it' s in my flight bag on the plane .
swap seats .
what ?
swap seats .
just keep your head low .
under my legs .
step out of the car .
i don' t think that' il be necessary .
what' s fbi doing with a stolen vehicle ?
it was required to complete my assignment .
what assignment ?
that' s classified .
who' s he ?
robbery suspect .
that' s all i can say .
he' s lying .
he' s working for the mafia .
criminals .
i' m kidnapped .
i' m being taken to the mafia to be killed .
that' s enough of your shit !
the officer doesn' t have time to listen to your fantasies .
right ?
i got time .
step out of the car .
hey , cowboy , this is not necessary .
i want you to shut up .
step out of the car , sir .
right over there .
this is not good .
you have any i. d. ?
you' re a long way from home .
not my choice .
stay here .
i need a verification of an fbi agent .
his name is zack grant .
i. d. number is ab 55 ... ... from the l. a. office .
he' s transporting an asian businessman by the name of yuji kobayashi .
present location is 45 miles east of barstow on route 1 6 .
everyone out of the car !
two years of training ... ... a couple of years as a beat cop ... ... and then another six to get to the rank you' re at ?
then you just chuck it all .
chuck it all for some score .
what , to buy a porsche or something ?
i don' t get it .
i don' t understand how a man of law can go bad .
he has his reasons .
you' re even worse , miss .
me ?
what did i do ?
you women are always talking about ... ... how you want to be treated with equality and respect .
and you end up falling for a loser like this guy .
you waste away your best years ... ... while countless nice guys are dying of loneliness .
classic c type .
excuse me ?
you' re not married , are you , officer ?
no .
do you live with your mother ?
of course not .
she lives with me .
what , am i gonna put her in a nursing home ?
now , see , he would probably do that .
leave his mother out of it .
just button it up .
down !
grab the wheel , yuji !
bull' s eye .
the keys .
fuck the keys .
get the gun !
dead or alive now , zack !
dead or alive !
come on , yuji !
like bagging caged rabbits .
down !
open the door .
open the door !
open the door !
okay , i was wrong !
i apologize .
i apologize for dragging you into this mess .
i apologize for putting your business ... ... and your people in jeopardy .
my evidence was circumstantial .
i shouldn' t have brought it forward .
things just got out of hand .
i' m convinced you had nothing to do with the death of victor serlano .
and you' re not a cold blooded killer .
you won' t leave us .
it' s not how you work .
seiko was my sister .
i couldn' t get near victor ... ... but with your help ... ... seiko could .
you sent her up there ?
you were right all along .
i did have something to do with victor' s death .
and i am a cold blooded killer .
open the door !
mary , get out of my way .
yuji , you can' t just leave us here !
any guy kills his own sister couldn' t give a shit about us .
you really killed your own sister ?
she wasn' t supposed to die !
i told her to plead self defense .
she couldn' t do that , yuji .
she couldn' t live with the guilt .
i didn' t want her to die .
she wasn' t like you .
she based her life on the american system of justice .
when you put her in the middle , you wrote the end of her life .
but serlano killed our godfather !
now he' s gonna kill my son .
and you were going to sacrifice me .
give me another option .
give me another option .
does it hurt ?
not really .
i do it very quickly .
it doesn' t feel a thing .
there we go .
all right , get low .
how do you like that ?
want to hold it ?
sure .
no , sit down .
be careful .
look at that .
you' re a fisherman .
it' s 8 : 00 , mr. serlano !
what ?
it' s 8 : 00 !
yeah , i know !
all right , come here .
we' re done ?
yeah .
yeah , we' re done .
but this is fun .
it is ?
yeah .
i' m glad you brought me here .
maybe you can get my dad to come here .
yeah , well ....
believe me , eric , i' ve tried .
you know , i hate to tell you this .
i don' t think your father cares about you .
i' m going out .
i get serlano .
what is it ?
what' s this about ?
we' il handle it .
hold it !
is this griffith lake ?
i have trouble folding those too .
you' re not supposed to be here !
i am if there' s fish to catch .
there' s no fishing .
what about that man and boy ?
they' re not fishing !
i see rod and reels .
you' re in the wrong place .
i' m supposed to learn fly fishing from this guy who was the adviser
you' re lost .
get out of here .
you guys part of a hunting cult or something ?

shell wedged between third and fourth vertebrae ... ... partially severing the spinal cord .
left ventricle punctured ... ... by a third and fourth fragment .
right ventricle destroyed by a fifth .
pelvic bone shattered .
scrotum and testicles no longer attached to the torso .
