the year 2078 .
a mining colony on planet sirius 6b .
for 50 years , the new economic block , the neb corporation ,
has controlled mining throughout the known solar systems .
20 years ago , on sirius 6b ,
the neb discovered the solution to the energy crisis .
berynium .
but mining berynium unleashed lethal doses of radiation and pollution .
the alliance " , a federation of mine workers and scientists ,
demanded mining be stopped .
the neb ' s reponse was to declare all out war .
this conflict has fuelled a new cold war on earth ,
but so far the fighting has been confined to sirius 6b .
massive neb bombing raids have devastated this beautiful planet .
thousands have been killed by deadly berynium radiation .
now , in the tenth year of the war , the survivors on sirius 6b
are faced with a new threat beyond imagination . . .
okay , ante up .
five .
okay , i see your five .
back in the slammer .
those were my last smokes .
this game sucks .
this whole place sucks .
lieutenant , i think you" d better have a look at this .
what the hell is he doing here ?
tell the captain we" ve got a situation .
a neb coming in .
how did he get this far ?
l" m going to take him .
he" s mine .
what are you waiting for ?
something" s not right .
he" s alone .
here comes the cavalry .
no matter how many times i see this , it still makes me sick .
l" m glad those things are on our side .
our side" s the good side , right ?
tell me again , it" s a little blurry .
we created them .
we didn" t have any choice .
without the screamers we" d have lost the war .
ls the neb still out there ?
yeah , but not in one piece .
just the one ?
what the hell was he doing out here ?
he had something in his hand that he wanted to show us .
well . . .
i guess l" d better take a look .
are you going out there ?
that" s a great plan .
lt" s probably some kind of bomb .
get off your butt and open the goddamn door .
check your tabs , sir .
to alllance com mander
who wrote this shit ?
mozart .
" don giovanni .
don giovanni ?
what the hell do you want , chuck ?
tear your eye away from that coin , and l" il tell you .
lt" s the portrait of a sphinx .
it belonged to augustus caesar , the first great emperor of the world .
riddle me this , caesar .
we haven" t seen a neb soldier in six months .
why does one solitary grunt get shredded by a screamer
trying to hand deliver this ?
priority seven .
you and me . . . and god , if he" s still paying attention .
i doubt it .
ls it a trick ?
i couldn" t get into it , either .
don" t do that !
scared you , didn" t l ?
jesus !
from marshall richard cooper , fifth neb army command .
to joseph hendricksson .
matters of extreme urgency .
demand immediate peace negotiation .
request two officers .
safe passage guaranteed .
we await your arrival asap .
peace negotiation .
they sound pretty desperate .
we" ve been waiting for this .
what have we been waiting for ?
the end of the war .
maybe it" s another bullshit tactic to get us to lay back .
macdonald , are you there ?
yes , sir .
i want the following message transmitted to san francisco .
have received first contact from neb army in six months .
they wish to open peace negotiations .
please advise .
we picked up an emergency message from a commercial transport .
we" re 5 million miles off of the shipping lanes .
find out what their emergency is .
no clearance , no landing .
joe , what do you make of this ?
looks like a map of the forward command post .
they" re laying themselves open .
so why the pony express ?
they" ve been completely silent for two weeks .
not even radio .
but why just one guy ?
why not a patrol ?
secretary green is arriving .
thank you , macdonald .
joe , chuck , i have some very inspiring news for you all .
alliance hq has been keeping it classified .
wrapped up tight .
the neb corporation has approached us requesting an armistice .
we could actually end this war .
reserves of berynium have been found on triton 4 .
after extensive testing , there" s no sign of radioactivity .
we are on the verge of signing a world peace agreement .
we" d also renew contracts with the neb to mine on triton 4 .
these negotiations are extremely delicate
and we can" t afford to do anything that might upset the apple cart . . .
sorry , sir .
fix it .
there" s radiation interference .
give me the damn thing .
morse code was better than this virtual reality shit .
it is imperative to make no contact with neb command on sirius 6b .
l" m sure you won" t do anything that would jeopardise our chances now .
peace , can you believe it ?
the nebs are businessmen .
now they" re mining on triton 4 , peace is in their interest .
thank god for green .
he" s a good man .
he prevented a war on earth .
a war on earth might" ve done them some good .
lf those assholes rolled around in the mud .
which assholes ?
nebs and us .
we were all nebs once .
exactly .
i just want to go home .
what" s the first thing you" il do ?
l" ve got no plans for the future .
you have a lot to look forward to .
lncome tax .
are you going to look her up when you get back ?
what for ?
you tell me .
she couldn" t take it .
she" s married and moved on . . . . . . and l" m still here .
not for long .
do you still think about her ?
it used to be every minute , then once a day .
about twice a year i get a kick in the chest .
what did she look like ?
all personnel .
radiation alert !
please light your reds .
i left mine in the office .
have you got one ?
he must have been a brave man . . . that neb soldier .
alert !
all personnel to their stations .
they" re not civilians .
no , a troop transport .
all ours .
how bad is it ?
no survivors .
then what the hell is that ?
get me out of here , man !
we" re going to cut you out of here .
just hang on .
sirius 6b transportation .
we" ve got no transportation service !
what the hell is that ?
you" ve got to look at this .
look at this .
and this . lt" s a bomb factory .
holy shit !
a nuclear reactor !
when did we last see one of these ?
what" s happening here ?
come on .
careful .
are you all right ?
calm down . l" m all right .
get this man a tab .
what the hell" s a tab ?
this guy" s naked here .
hold on a second .
one second !
l" m out of here .
dept .
of defence
revlsed
you wanted to see me , commander ?
yeah .
at ease , we" re informal around here .
that" il be all , rodgers .
how are you doing ?
good . . . there" s a scar on my arm .
lf you go outside without a tab on , you" il lose your arm .
name ?
private michael jefferson .
gunnery specialist on six levels .
first class .
level six ?
you can shoot the dots off a dice at 1 00 yards .
lf you can load it , i can shoot it .
lnstructors used to call me " ace " .
everybody here calls me " sir " .
yes , sir .
sir , what are they ?
lt" s a sword .
take a look .
screamers were developed to neutralize the war on the ground .
how do you know it" s dead ?
i yanked its brain out .
that" il take your finger off !
you said it was dead .
it still has a mechanical surface reflex .
they get shot up , but can still swing a sword .
pretty smart .
maybe too smart .
it seems to have modified itself .
where" s everybody else ?
the guys who were with me ?
how many men onboard ?
38 , including me .
now there" s one , including you .
those guys . . .
i didn" t even know them .
i couldn" t even talk to them .
jefferson . . . what in the hell are you doing here ?
there was a nuclear reactor aboard programmed for weapons manufacture .
i wasn" t aware of that .
you radioed you were civilian .
where were you bound ?
triton 4 .
why were you carrying a nuclear reactor and weapons ?
to invade , attack and extinguish the enemy .
what enemy ?
the nebs .
you were going to attack the nebs on triton 4 ?
yes . . . but we" re just a task force .
4, 000 alliance army regulars are on their way to triton 4 right now .
secretary green informed us . . .
secretary green ?
that" s right .
secretary green is gone .
he" s been gone for almost two years .
we got a v. r. communique from him yesterday .
secretary green was arrested and eliminated by the alliance command .
two years ago .
dismissed .
i enlisted to fight . . .
dismissed , jefferson .
the nebs have been running . . .
get out of here !
what in god" s name are we doing , chuck ?
we just saw green .
we saw bullshit !
you know as well as i do that they can send us anything they want .
that kid doesn" t know policy .
get your head out of the lilacs .
do you expect me to believe that we" re being dumped ?
that our 20 year stand here has turned into a galactic gold rush ?
they keep sending us provisions .
will they let us die up here while they carry on running the universe ?
i don" t buy it .
wake up , man !
we are betrayed here , brother .
we are beached .
green" s been shit canned and this whole place is a lie !
they just can" t cut us off up here .
families on earth would raise hell .
and they won" t take us back there .
lf we sound off about this , nobody" s going to fight their war for them .
they" re just going to let us roll on and on up here .
we ain" t ever getting off here .
marshall cooper and his neb command knows it , too !
he sent us a map .
your solitary neb grunt got his ass shot to stop this thing .
they know it" s pointless now .
where are you going ?
l" m going to neb command .
we" il make our own peace right here .
neb said they wanted two men .
somebody" s got to stay here in case anyone else falls out of the sky .
l" il take johnny gung ho .
the kid ?
l" m not risking any more of our men .
this is your tab .
it won" t work for anybody but you .
that makes me feel a lot better .
screamers only attack living things .
they read your pulse rate .
your tab broadcasts a false heartbeat , flat lining you .
ln theory they work perfectly , but radioactivity corrodes them .
what then ?
we thank god you" re a good gunner .
i was remembering that day up in point reyes .
that bartender . . .
with the monkey .
the beach .
we sat drinking beer , watching the humpbacks blowing .
you watched the whales , joe .
i was watching other things .
we should go back there .
l" d like to see that again .
what , girls volleyball ?
hey , joe . . .
l" il see you soon .
on that day .
jefferson , are you coming or are you breathing hard ?
good luck .
cicero , this is libby .
radio check , over .
cicero reading you loud and clear .
next transmission will be 33 : 00 and then every 4 hours after that .
lf i miss one , don" t sweat it .
lf i miss two . . . . . . move into the office , change the music and carry on .
i' il take the office , but the " don giovanni " will have to go .
roger , copy .
the air is terrible out here .
lt" s what" s in the air .
what , radiation ?
this" il neutralize it .
here .
lt" s an anti radiation red .
that" s what poisoned it ?
that used to be the most profitable , wonderful enterprise in the galaxy .
it produced berynium .
the answer to the world" s energy question .
a spoonful could take you from earth to saturn in a day .
then those mines started puking up tons of radiation .
we thought we" d discovered gold . . . but we discovered shit .
and you smoke this shit just to neutralize the shit in your lungs .
how do you know it" s working ?
lf you don" t die .
god !
what happened here ?
blasts .
neb bombers .
they nuked the civilians ?
the civilians got in the way .
the bombs were aimed at us .
you just don" t have a clue about what brought you here , do you ?
you" d fight for any son of a bitch if he convinced you you were right .
someone convinced you .
not someone , something .
the alliance was formed to support you .
you" re right , jefferson .
and it divided my country and my world .
so as much as you" re dying to get shot by some neb soldier ,
we" re going to make peace with these people , you and me .
we" re going to rip you off of that experience .
look at this place .
i came here 20 years ago to mine berynium for the neb .
we were all nebs then .
the scientists found radiation and shut down the mines .
the neb corporation threatened them , and there was a stand off for years .
they they started to rain everything down on us .
nuclear disc bombs , chain bombs , bacteria crystals .
civilian survivors were evacuated .
we retreated to the bunker .
how did you fight back ?
we reinvented an early weapon .
the sword ?
the autonomous mobile sword .
the screamer .
save it .
they don" t eat rats , do they ?
we" re not sure .
they" re scavengers and they learn .
they use everything .
rotting meat gives off methane gas for fuel .
maybe eyeball jelly makes good blade wax .
are they machines ?
are they alive ?
i don" t understand . . .
i don" t have the answers , jefferson .
but where are they coming from ?
underground .
the first design was sent to us from the alliance on earth .
lt" s all automated now .
no one" s been down there since they pushed the first button and ran .
they make themselves now .
and no one knows how ?
they" re down there breeding like rabbits and no one knows ?
am i speaking swahili ?
that" s exactly what i mean .
hit the dirt !
come out of there !
come out of there !
come forward .
stop .
can i come with you ?
my god . . .
cover me .
go .
jefferson .
you all right ? lt" s okay .
what have you got there ?
let me see .
that" s a good guy .
no , you keep him .
that" s your friend .
where do you live ?
ln there ?
yes .
ln the ruins ?
how many are you ?
how many people ?
you" re alone ?
how do you survive ?
food .
what kind of food ?
different .
how do you keep away from the screamers ?
the blades underground that kill .
i hide .
can i come with you ?
no , you stay here .
give me a macro ration .
we" il give you something to eat .
we" il come back for you .
ln two or three days we" il find you .
take this .
you tear this and eat it .
i want to come with you now .
we" il come back in two days .
you take care of this guy , okay ?
we can" t just leave him here .
he" s a kid .
he" il never survive .
what am i saying ?
can i come with you ?
what" s your name ?
david edward dearing .
where" s your mum and dad ?
they died in the blasts .
you" ve been alone here for four years ?
everything seems to be okay .
ls it safe to make a fire like this ?
we want to let them know we" re coming .
fire keeps the rats away .
rats ?
i had this friend , he used to eat them .
rats .
you" il appreciate this . . .
you don" t just heat up the oil , that makes them stick to the pan .
you get the pan hot , put the oil in cold , then add your rats .
but don" t crowd the pan , it sucks all the heat out .
you keep flipping them , or they burn .
my friend said . .
jefferson !
you must be confusing me with somebody who gives a shit .
give me that rock , boy .
cicero , this is libby calling .
come in , cicero .
libby , how is it out there ?
lt" s cold .
we" re at 1 4 degrees north latitude .
we expect to reach the neb command . . . . . . in about four hours .
hello . . ?
we' ve got a new arrival .
he came in yesterday .
chuck , you" re breaking up .
you" il get your next transmission at 00 : 00 hours .
libby , over .
it seems a little strange . . .
lf you" re gonna be a rock , be a rock .
don" t be a bug .
don" t do that to me !
i nearly pissed my pants . . . sir .
things ain" t what they used to be .
jefferson !
didn" t you hear it ?
no .
good god , man !
cool , huh ?
do you know how much they cost ?
keep that on your wrist .
doesn" t it work if it" s nearby ?
it stays on your arm !
l" m already dragging one kid around .
do i have to tie your shoes for you ?
your tab was on and it was going for you .
what is this ?
l" ve never seen this .
it looks like an animal .
lt" s not an animal .
lt" s an upgrade .
maybe it" s a neb one .
jefferson , relent .
we" re getting out of here .
take your bear with you .
where are we going ?
a long way for you , kid .
you soap the socks the night before .
the water dries out but the soap stays in .
you" ve got soap against skin . . .
have you got a dimmer switch ?
lf you put a teddy bear in a microwave , nothing will happen .
but a wet frog . . .
shut up .
jefferson !
goddamn screamer !
it wanted to kill us .
it can see us and touch us .
i can" t tell what the signals say .
it can talk .
he" s a fucking toaster .
that" s right .
pinocchio" s not a real little boy .
why didn" t it try to kill us ?
it was tagging you .
they" re smarter now .
they get into our bunkers .
they tag along .
who can resist a kid with a hard luck story ?
once it gets inside , the killing starts .
but you knew that already .
you brought him in here .
it found us .
what is your reason for being here ?
we were invited here for a peace negotiation .
marshall cooper sent this from neb headquarters .
you want to negotiate . . ?
we ain" t gonna do it here .
are you taking them to the bunker ?
you got something better to do ?
sir , do you trust these guys ?
no .
what are you doing ?
calling the office .
problem ?
cicero , this is libby .
come in .
how is it out there ?
we" ve got a new kind of screamer .
i can' t hear you real well .
lt" s a kid .
a little boy .
don" t let it into the bunker .
i can' t hear you .
there' s too much interference .
that kid , he was like a person .
how did he know what to say ?
you think santa makes them his little elves ?
they" ve got more brains than you .
fighting won" t solve our problems .
one of those kids tagged my patrol .
we took him into our bunker .
nobody got out .
except you .
what" s that supposed to mean ?
you figure it out .
you guys brought them here .
only after the bombing started .
but now they don" t care what uniform is covering your ass .
neither do l .
slow down , soldier .
neither do l .
slow down , soldier .
would you mind taking that outside ?
stray bullets are bad for the inventory .
lt" s worth a lot more when it ain" t all shot to . . . shit .
l" m letting you stay here out of the kindness of my heart , becker .
so follow the ground rules .
first , no gunplay inside .
second , this is my place , and nobody touches anything .
real scotch , not synthetic shit .
no spitting .
spare a cigarette ?
well , gentlemen . . .
live it up .
i haven" t had an american cigarette in over a year .
there" s plenty back at base , but i forgot to bring them .
you got the last one .
very generous of you .
what is this place , a commissary ?
there hasn" t been a commissary here in over two years .
not since those blades arrived .
are you a freelancer ?
right .
black market , commander . . .
hendricksson , joseph .
san francisco .
jessica hanson , pittsburgh .
how do you do ?
lt" s early in the day for that .
yeah .
l" m looking for marshall cooper , fifth neb army .
he" d be in the command bunker , if there still is one .
what about your communication satellites ?
lf they" re still working , they" d be in there , too .
what do you mean by that ?
you have no idea of the hell you opened up .
we opened up ?
just tell me where the command bunker is .
you wouldn" t last ten yards out there without me .
have you seen it ?
i heard it .
hordes of them .
what hordes ?
davids .
i heard them screaming into the bunker above us .
i heard the soldiers screaming .
then it got very quiet .
nothing . . . except the smell of death .
still want a guided tour ?
lf cooper is alive , l" il find him .
l" il take you to command .
we" il go underground .
i want something in return .
speak .
i want off this ashtray .
where ?
earth .
how long do you think l" m gonna last in here ?
nobody leaves .
the nebs and alliance are fighting on triton 4 .
they" ve hung everybody on this planet out to dry .
good lord , you" re beautiful .
i can take you back to the alliance bunker .
deal .
going somewhere , jessica ?
she" s taking me to neb command and l" m taking her to alliance .
cosy .
and then what ?
become a prisoner of war ?
you can relocate anywhere if you can get off this globe .
or you can go straight to hell for all i care .
you" re crazy .
you don" t know what" s down there .
afraid of the dark , ross ?
get off my back .
look at this . lt" s one of ours .
she" s got everything .
and i found something else .
what is it ?
a plutonium rocket .
plutonium ?
have i been blowing smoke out of my ass ?
we" ve not used nukes in this war yet and we" re not going to use them now .
so leave it .
okay , let" s get on the good foot .
anybody that" s coming , come on .
when he" s best , he" s little worse than a man .
and when he" s worst , he" s little better than a beast .
i never knew they put shakespeare in comic books .
ain" t it sharp enough yet ?
lt" s never sharp enough .
l" m not sure if these tabs work , but stay close to me and jefferson .
let" s go .
this leads to the maintenance tunnel underneath the command bunker .
i ain" t going in there .
don" t tell me a big guy like you is scared of mice !
has a rat got your tongue ?
get off my back .
ls that all you know how to say ?
explain your vocabulary , ross .
knock it off !
just get off my back !
we" re almost there .
this is the command centre .
this is the ground level .
redlscover paradlse on slrus 6b
what the hell is this ?
lt" s exactly what you think it is .
i knew it !
we" re all gonna die !
jefferson , if that man moves , or even farts , shoot him .
shut up .
lf richard cooper were alive , he" d be here , wouldn" t he ?
the comsat stabilizers are all frozen .
this one" s free .
uplink attempt initiated .
sat net downlink does not respond .

what was so important back there ?
what other type ?
david was a type 3 .
the reptile was a type 1 .
what" s the other type ?

lt" s a . . . type 2 .
genius .
you can count up to three .
get off my back !
lt" s a wounded soldier .
" help me .
help me .
there were only a few reported .
we thought you" d discontinued them .
we" ve never seen them .
what do they look like ?
who do they look like ?
look in the mirror , ross .
l" m warning you . . . just get off my back .
they keep saying the same thing over and over .
just get off my . . !
exactly .
he" s one of them .
he" s a machine .
type 2 .
he kept repeating himself .
you heard him .
and what about the scotch ?
you saw , he didn" t take a sip .
that" s right , sir .
we offered , but he refused .
that" s blood .
bullshit .
bullshit ?
take a look .
i see a human being who got wasted for no reason at all .
what are you looking at ?
that wasn" t very human of you .
until two days ago , i didn" t even know you existed .
you think l" m one of them ?
then you" d better kill me , too .
see if l" ve got any switches inside .
come on , be on the safe side .
do it !
man , l" m out of here .
anybody that" s coming , come on .
cicero , this is libby .
come in .
cicero , this is libby .
come in .
lf you get killed , will your man let us in ?
not if he" s smart .
do you want me to say l" m sorry ?
well , l" m not .
it was a mistake .
l" il kill you before i let you make another one .
just got out of basic training , didn" t you ?
lt" s pretty obvious you" re a rookie .
you think you" re the centre of the universe , but you" re not .
we" re just insignificant little specks , you and me .
we" re not gonna change the world .
we" re not gonna win the war .
nobody" s gonna care that we die .
which many signify that you should snarl and bite and play the dog .
not me .
shakespeare ?
very good .
cicero , this is libby .

where will we go ?
where do you go when there" s nowhere else to go ?
home .
earth .
earth .
there" s an emergency escape vehicle for use by the commanding officer .
lt" s hidden in these mountains in a place named ironically
for where they developed the first atomic bomb .
alamogordo .
l" ve never been there .
what are you talking about ?
there" s a way off this planet .
type 2 ?
hell if i know .
l" ve never even seen this tag .
l" ve never even seen this language .
can i see it ?
yeah .
god ! l" m sorry .
give it to me . l" m sorry .
i had to know .
