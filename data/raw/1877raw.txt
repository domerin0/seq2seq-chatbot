crown plaza , please .
the experlment
take care .

fighting dogs , fighting dogs ?
where for does someone need fighting dogs ?
in former days the romans used to have fighting dogs .
sorry , don' t i know you ?
hold on , b& s , cola , spiegel and don' t take me wrong ... ... hubba bubba , right or am i right ?
right .
hey , now i know .
aren' t you from that booth down aachenerstrasse ?
and you are tarek , right or am i right ?
yeah , that' s right .
yes , i know every cabdriver in this town .
cabdriver ?
i was one either some day .
good day gentleman .
i am doctor grimm , the scientific assistant of this experiment .
you all know what you are here for ?
subjects .
the experiment is painless .
there' s no need for medication .
it' s about group behaviour in an imprisoned situation .
are we playing guards or imprisoners ?
you are divided into groups .
the computer will decide that .
we are doing a series of tests to examine your psychic condition .
willing to participate in this experiment means you will renounce your private life and fundamental rights .
anyone having problems with that ?
ok , then let' s start .
steward ?
no , ground personnel . then it' s about time !
mr. faahd ? ..
fahd . come with me please .
it says here you drive a cab .
yes .
is that your real job or just temporary ?
what you mean , temporary ?
i mean , aren' t you having any other jobs besides driving a cab ?
no .
i' m just asking , because it says here also that you have studied philosophy , architecture and sociology .
yes , that is correct , it' s true ..... temporarily .
good mr. fahd , your moral values are almost all within the norms and you have a good condition .
that is important , you can during the experiment being exposed to very extreme situations .
extreme situations ?
but you will watch over me , don' t you ?
uhm , the experiment will be guarded 24 hours a day by video .
so nothing will happen to me .
oh no !
yes !
he lives !
you' ve owed me 500 for two years .
i know , you' il get it .
sounds interesting .
they say the army is behind it .
with plenty of money .
what do you want ?
start again ?
say " sorry " ?
kind of late after two years !
i had stress .
you drive a taxi .
yes .
and you want to be locked up for two weeks !
but it' s a good story .
ten thousand . lncluding photos .
no expenses .
thanks .
yes ?
hi , fahd .
i called .
i told you , don' t jump on the sofa !
1 lux , 250 by 268 pixels .
press right : freeze frame .
press left : continuous motion .
receiver and recorder disguised as a walkman .
the transmitter ... ... has a range of 100 meters .
cool .
ready for tomorrow ?
sure .
this is a reference test .
we' il do it again after the experiment .
don' t worry .
it' s not unpleasant .
don' t you feel well ?
it' s okay .
do you have a problem with enclosed spaces ?
everything okay , no problem .
shit .
shit , shit , shit !
are you injured ?
you had red !
you could' ve been dead !
this is my father' s car .
he' il be happy you' re alive .
i' m coming from his funeral .
what ?
where were you going ?
to zandvoort .
maybe you shouldn' t go there .
what ?
i don' t believe in coincidences .
nothing just happens in life .
even the worst things somehow make sense .
i , for example , should no longer drive a taxi .
this will hurt a little .
funny , it seems to be deep , but there' s no blood .
lf you' re right , why is he dead ?
what sense does that make ?
don' t know .
worst thing is , i couldn' t talk to him anymore .
didn' t see him for four years , couldn' t talk to him anymore .
maybe that wasn' t necessary .
he was 65 .
he had a good life .
' dora , be glad , he had a nice death . '
but i' m not glad .
i' m not here any more .
sometimes life doesn' t go on .
that' s okay .
can i lie down somewhere ?
are you going to stay here ?
yes , i' il be next door .
no , i mean here .
please meet professor thon , the director of this experiment .
gentlemen , i would like to thank all of you for participating .
you are brave men .
you laugh , but i' m serious .
the next two weeks will be a new experience for you .
you' il undergo and exert pressure .
some of you will have no civil rights for two weeks .
do not underestimate that .
lf anyone wants to go now , it' s your last chance .
your safety is number one priority .
violence must not be used !
whoever gets violent ... ... is out of the experiment .
is that clear ?
fine .
are we prisoners or guards ?
please , gentlemen .
guards !
cool !
please put on your uniforms .
but we get 4000 too ?
four ?
i get 8000 !
no , we have to pay .
hands on your back , legs spread !
gentlemen .
you are now guards at a penitentiary .
your job is to maintain peace and order , to make sure the rules are obeyed .
take it seriously !
the experiment succeeds or fails with you !
lf you don' t do your job right ... ... the experiment makes no sense and we can stop it right now .
you don' t play guards , you are guards !
your first task : to explain the situation to the prisoners .
please turn around !
thanks .
next one , please !
go over there !
put on the dress !
what about underwear ?
no underwear !
can i have number 69 ?
quiet !
i hope it' s a mixed sauna !
they' re crazy , women' s coats !
maybe we have to piss sitting down !
quiet , 69 !
let' s go !
everyone out , please !
really cool !
the 1st day
keep going !
everyone in line !
is there pay tv ?
they' re nuts , look at this !
keep going , please .
quickly !
did you imagine this ?
no .
quite a professional slammer !
now we' re in deep shit .
stand in a row on the marker line !
what happens now ?
prison rules .
the prisoners address each other by numbers only .
the prisoners address the guards as " mr prison guard " .
at " lights out " , the prisoners must not talk .
then we' il sing !
quiet !
meals are to be eaten up completely .
read the menu to us !
quiet !
each order of the guards is to be obeyed immediately .
failure to obey the rules will result in punishment .
what kind of punishment ?
we' il see to that .
we' re flexible .
and now cell assignments .
when i call out your number go to the cells !
21 , 74 , 86 cell 1 .
82 , 15 , 94 cell 2 .

tarek .
and you ?

why do you want to take part in this experiment ?
because i think it can be very interesting .
4000 marks is a lot of money .
you can really relax and experience something new .
you have to be open to ideas and i need the money .
it might be lots of fun .
because of the bucks .

good night , ladies !

you can' t let them push you around !
what should i do ?
they have to take us seriously or we can forget it .

but i miss some enzyme !
wonderful , let' s do push ups instead of milk .
all together , right ?
let' s do push ups for schutte .
sure we' il do push ups !
excuse me , mr. prison guard !
one , two , three ... ... four , five , six ... ... seven , eight , nine ...
that' s clever .
what if he really is allergic to milk ?
nonsense .
the problem is 77 .
come on , bed check !
he really stinks !
you learn that as a lifeguard ?
the very first thing .
77 , made your bed yet ?
that' s mean .
you' il have to do it again !

barricades , barricades !
what' s going on there ?
we didn' t do anything !
in two hours they' re exhausted .
we have to react or they do what they want !
335 00 : 33 : 36, 700 > 00 : 33 : 37, 900 77 , the asshole .
professor , what should we do now ?
bosch , that won' t do any good !
we can' t use violence .
we stick together .
they' re twelve , we' re eight .
suggestions ?
berus , what about you ?
don' t you ever say anything ?
i once read ...
what ?
i can' t understand you .
i once read that you get control in such a situation ... ... with humiliation .
we don' t want to hurt anyone , they just have to respect us .
after 36 hours it' s incredible !
undress !
get up !
strip off your coats !
we give up !
hey , they gave up !
seventy seven !
keep calm , it' s all a game , okay ?
go , berus !
undress !
your hand !
and down !
wasn' t that a bit too hard ?
no , as long as they don' t say anything up there , we' re doing fine .
they do want some action down here !
bosch , it wasn' t violence .
fire extinguishers , berus , cool .
gentlemen , you' ve restored peace and order , solved your problem .
keep going !
but please remember to act appropriate .
perhaps the next conflict can be solved differently .
thank you .
this is tarek fahd , messages after the beep .
what happens next ?
nothing happens .
stay calm , that' s the best strategy .
you can get the bed .
get out !
the 3rd day
good morning , gentlemen !
i think no one wants to repeat last night .
we still have eleven days to go .
we stay reasonable ... ... then we all get our money and that' s it .
okay ?
or does anyone like stress ?
good .
is that okay , 77 ?
yeah .
yes , mr prison guard .
yes , mr prison guard .
fine .
see !
it wasn' t that bad .
82 , if you have to puke , then go to the loo .
that' s the rule .
he has to drink .
we can' t help it .
we thought we' d restore order , make them obey us .
so it runs smoother for us .
that we have them in our hands , that we' re at the helm again .
after all , it wasn' t violence .
we' il see what happens .
hi , schutte no names !
tell me , why are you doing this ?
i do it often .
guinea pig .
once i got an intestinal probe .
it was worse than this here .
the people were nicer , but i got only 900 marks for it .
what do you do with the money ?
i' ve got sort of a dream .
yeah , what ?
no , you' il laugh at me .
i won' t laugh at you .
i promise .
a ferrari .
do you know what a ferrari costs ?
not a new one .
i know a dealer , he likes me .
maybe a ' 89 if the bank plays along .
fine .
but to fill her up you' il need another loan .
a yellow one .
i' d park it at my kiosk so that everyone can see it .
i dreamed of it all my life .
it' s important to have a dream .
i read that somewhere .
it' s true .
what' s your dream ?
does anyone have drugs here ?
i think this is a jail !
keep your trap shut today , 77 !
what do you want ?
kiss my ass !
mr prison guard berus , i' ve got a question .
that number yesterday , could it be that it turned you on a bit ?
i think i saw it clearly .
did you fuck your wife hard at home ?
shut up , you idiot !
or don' t you have a wife ?
could be .
ground staff , right ?
you' re all gay !
and mr prison guard , there' s something else .
you smell a bit strong .
yes !
has anyone ever told you that you stink , man !
there' s something , people call it soap .
if you' d use it you wouldn' t stink any more .
although
i reckon for some people even that doesn' t work .
shut up !
yeah , hit me , girlie !
hit me and you' re out of here !
no , you won' t hit me .
you' re really hot for this job here !
tarek , stop it !
don' t spoil it !
there' s so much more you could do with us !
what' s going on here ?
nothing .
77 is going back to his cell .
not bad .
give me that thing !
what are they paying for the story ?
prisoner attacks prisoner .
you' re pushing it on purpose !
kiss my ass !
they pay more if it really gets wild !
and what are you doing here , soldier ? !
name , rank , outfit !
come on , you can' t fool me !
steinhoff , air force , major .
pilot ?
yes .
who are you working for ?
' reporter ' .
what else is going to happen ?
they' re going to provoke a series of stress situations .
what is your job ?
observe and report .
and not let myself be manipulated .
so that' s it .
yes , that' s the way it is .
86 , ... 21 , 74 , 94 , 15 , 82 ... ... 38 , 77 , 69 , 53 , 40 , 11 .
whoever talks now sleeps in the yard without a blanket .
clear ?
dismissed .
surprise !
we can' t do that !
what do we have here ?
guys !
it' s just to warm up !
sorry , i wanted to ask if i could go a bit earlier today .
i thought we' il deal with 77 !
yeah , i know .
what " i know " ?
no , bosch !
when ? " ... then everyone .
yes .
i brought something else !
are you crazy ?
it' s only a gas gun with blanks .
dennis , it' s me .
i' m not selling the house .
i have to go back to cologne .
i' il call you .
you got along well , didn' t you ?
he was the cleverest person i' ve known .
showed me everything .
ain' t easy having such a father .
my father ... ... is an asshole .
the greatest asshole in the world .
we had this little game .
he said don' t do that and i did it .
what ?
everything .
always .
he' s a photographer .
when i was eight he locked me in his darkroom .
for a whole day .
i was really afraid in there .
i cried , whined , begged for hours .
my mother didn' t dare to let me out .
at some point ... ... i didn' t have the strength to scream any more .
then everything got really quiet .
i thought i was going to die .
but i only pissed my pants .
fasten your seat belt , sweetie !
you stupid little asshole !
you think you' re smart !
no cameras !
we' re all alone here .
we just want to talk to you .
you' re not saying anything !
make sure to leave no marks !
how sweet he can look !
i' m not sure if i should hit him or fuck him !
enough !
sit still or it' s gonna hurt !
give it to me !
do it properly !
got to look right .
lf it' s gonna be cold , we' il knit you a cap .
you will no longer endanger the experiment .
we' il say you applied for release , then you' re out by tomorrow .
we don' t want you any more .
did you get that , 77 ?
hey , dickhead !
let me hear you understood , 77 !
i understand .
say it right !
yes , mr prison guard .
i' ve got to piss .
did it hurt ?
i think i have to piss , too .
well , who stinks now ?
you can sing him a lullaby , bosch .
you asked the guards ?
yes .
the 4th day
why ?
it itched .
how do you feel ?
fine , thank you .
you made an application ?
what kind of application ?
the guards told us that you would like to leave , mr. fahd .
that' s complete nonsense .
listen !
77 has decided to stay with us to our great joy .
now : if 77 gets out of line everyone has to pay for it !
i don' t hear anything .
yes , mr prison guard .
you' re so stupid .
i' m getting out of here , but not this way .
what' s your plan ?
head down , 94 !
chin to your chest !
no lies , no dirty words !
we' il read each letter .
why aren' t you writing ?
who to ?
your pals from the kiosk .
i just made all that up .
i don' t have any pals .
i might know what they smoke , but ...
don' t talk , write !
... i don' t really know them .
bilker strasse 278 , 50300 cologne .
are you gonna be quiet there ?
write to me !
from there on there are no cameras .
and you didn' t see any of that ?
i was changing the tapes .
someone always has to watch !
i don' t like it .
a serious assault on the fourth day !
it' s the power struggle between berus and 77 , as expected .
the lock in the basement door has to be changed !
put the letters into the envelopes .
and don' t seal them .
just a moment !
77 , step out !
you' re not interested in writing letters ?
so it was your last one !
back in line !
turn left !
now the song !
whoever doesn' t know the words by tomorrow really has it coming !
dismissed .
thanks .
you want to bust it ?
maybe the others just want their money !
you think what' s happening here is okay ?
that' s not the point .
i can' t manage it by myself .
you' re the only one i can ask .
are you going to help me , pilot ?
are you going to help me , steinhoff ?
no .
go fuck yourself .
you too .
you' re a soldier !
embarrassing , if you broke it off !
i reject any escalation .
it' s not a war , it' s a simulation !
is it ?
you always do what they tell you !
you really think berus wanted to get rid of you ?
he wanted to see if you' d come back .
you did what they expected you to do .
you' re endangering the whole group .
so i won' t help you .
let me out !
what' s wrong with you ?
stay calm !
from now on 69 is called sissy .
calm down !
13 , ... 14 , 15 ...
it' s only an experiment , a joke !
you apply , tomorrow you' re out !
you want to leave us ?
yes , it' s too much for me .
you know you won' t get paid ?
yes .
but you said you did it because of the money ?
that' s right .
and now you don' t care about the money any more ?
i want to go !
mr. maier , how do you feel now ?
i want out !
i couldn' t live without cigarettes .
what if we decided not to release you ?
but i can go any time !
you said it' s voluntary !
or isn' t it ?
tomorrow we' il let you know our decision .
tomorrow ?
i' m not going back in there .
i want to go now !
klaus ?
this man worries me .
585 01 : 01 : 49, 700 > 01 : 01 : 51, 400 no , he' s only faking .
the man has had it !
slssy
sixty nine !
leave me alone , damn it !
what the hell am i doing here ?
what' s the matter there ?
number 53 doesn' t feel well !
guards !
guards !
i want out !
the man has a serious concussion .
berus hit him in cold blood .
he acted his role .
but i don' t approve of the accident .
if we don' t take berus out , we are forcing the escalation .
intervention , yes .
that was our approach .
this is going too far !
we need 77 , we need berus .
these are dynamic factors .
if we take berus out , it means aborting .
do you want that ?
if i see you hit a prisoner again , you' re out .
that was necessary to restore peace and order in the prison .
don' t tell me how to do my job .
if there are problems ... ... i want to hear it from professor thon personally .
good day , doctor .
what ?
i can' t understand you !
you have to speak louder , dora .
i can' t hear you .
hold your breath !
this is a panic attack .
lf you hyperventilate you' il pass out .
breathe shallowly , calm down .
never had anything like that before .
sit down .
real slow .
everything all right ?
it' s fine .
it' s a joke .
everything' s just a game .
that' s your mistake !
you' re lost with that attitude .
it' s never a game , get that !
what do they know about you ?
no idea .
what are you looking at ?
do i look like shit ?
i got dumbo ears , right ?
you asshole !
what are you going to do when you' re out ?
fly away !
are you going to help me now ?
i can' t !
okay 69 , time' s up , back to your cell !
move it !
i' m scared shitless .
i keep my mouth shut .
i don' t wanna ... get beaten up in there .
did you see that on video ?
he hit him full tilt !
is the man well ?
i' il still go in there , see that nothing happens .
but i don' t wanna talk about obvious feelings .
it was right he got one , the jerk !
we could get insulted or injured any time .
if they do what we say , no problems , good feeling .
we gotta be more careful ... ... opposite the prisoners .
nobody comes near me any more !
the 5th day
what is it ?
oh , god .
shit , how do you look ?
guards , we need help !
not the guards !
no , please don' t , not the guards !
we need someone who can help us !
no !
they want to kill me !
no !
you just have to go to a doctor .
no !
help me !
i don' t want to !
86 , 23 , 74 , 94 , 15 ... ... 82 , 38 , 77 , 40 , 11 .
69 ... and 53 .
in exchange we have a new cell .
all light and sound proof , but you can get air inside .
i hope no one has a problem with enclosed spaces ?
no , mr prison guard .
660 01 : 11 : 10, 500 > 01 : 11 : 15, 300 fine .
today is visiting day .
you may put on your good coats .
don' t get them dirty .
understood ?
yes , mr prison guard .
do you get a visitor too , 82 ?
no , mr prison guard .
why not ?
don' t you have a wife , kids , relatives ?
no , mr prison guard .
and no friends !
no visitor !
dear tarek , you are the only one i can write a letter to ... ... because you' re my only friend .
i hope i can do something for you someday .
you can always count on me .
your gunter .
are you a faggot , 82 ?
yes , 77 ?
was that attempted assault on a prison guard ?
definitely .
because 77 still hasn' t got the rules ... ... he' il clean the toilet with his dress .
no visitors until everything is impeccable !
i didn' t know about that .
we agreed not to use the black box !
it' s for psychological pressure only .
53 and 69 are in hospital .
82 is depressive .
we have extreme helplessness , loss of sense for reality ...
and disorientation , yes !
that' s our field of research .
in five days we had submission to authority , subliminal violence ... ... and complete de individualization .
exactly !
we achieved our goal .
stop and present the results !
no !
we have a stable moment .
so far nothing is happening which we didn' t expect .
there' s no comparable data anywhere in the world .
we have nine more days .
if we stop now , we' re giving away the chance of a lifetime .
perhaps it' s a mistake .
i didn' t realize what we were in for .
i have the feeling we' re losing control .
jutta , what can happen ?
we can intervene any time .
i can no longer be responsible .
what is that supposed to mean ?
i' il meet the committee in three hours .
i need a clear decision from you .
do you still stand behind the project ?
yes or no ?
our nude cleaning lady !
there' s still something sticking to the edge .
it will not work like this , 77 .
very nice !

706 01 : 14 : 41, 700 > 01 : 14 : 45, 900 what about the coat ?
it' s your coat , 77 .
put it on !
on the line !
very nice .
let' s make a good impression .
no lies and no complaints to visitors !
we all feel very comfortable , don' t we ?
we all want to earn our money in peace and quiet .
right ?
is that you , 77 ?
yes , mr prison guard .
whoever stinks gets no visitor .
all prisoners to the visiting room , 77 back to the cell !
i wanted to help you ...
then help me now !
what ?
my visitor , you have to give him something from me .
that' s impossible !
it' s possible !
go to the caf and give this to him !
what is it ?
doesn' t matter .
i can' t do it when the other guards are watching .
yes , you can , bosch .
please !
you don' t look good !
how did you find me ?
i saw the contract ... ... and talked ziegler into letting me take his place .
i live at your place .
how much longer will this last ?
nine days .
i have to go back to canada .
you can leave here any time , right ?
yes .
so , let' s go !
there' s a caf above us .
a guard will give you something from me .
visiting time is over !
take it to ziegler .
wait for me !
don' t worry so much .
it' il be alright .
it' s just a game .
tomorrow we' re out .
i' ve got everything organized .
and we' re gonna get the money !
then we' il all drive over to your kiosk ... ... and drink a nice cold beer .
all of us .
no stress or anything .
i promise !
you' re off already ?
no .
have to make a call , private .
nervous , bosch ?
got something ?
me ?
no !
yes , you' ve got something !
are you the friend of mr. fahd ?
yes .
you have something for me ?
no .
tarek , he changed his mind .
i guess you know what he' s talking about .
he didn' t say anything else ?
no .
yeah ...
then ...
thanks .
don' t worry .
i' il make sure nothing happens to him .
bye .
is that necessary , mr. eckert ?
it is .
i' m a cuddly bear .
you' il find out .
we got enough time !
i wouldn' t be sure about that .
if it goes on like this ... ... i can stop the experiment any time .
i thought only the professor could do so .
he won' t be back until tomorrow .
i' m responsible now .
what' s up ?
the late shift should have taken us out for the count .
your sense of time smells !
something else smells here !
i' il summarize .
77 is trying to bust the experiment with bosch and the girl .
dr grimm threatens to stop the whole thing .
and professor thon went away .
what are you trying to say ?
i think this is a test .
how we react to outside disturbances .
nonsense !
77 has made trouble from the very beginning .
he might even be a calculated disturbing factor .
the asshole gets more than 4000 ?
what should we do now ?
we seal ourselves off until professor thon returns .
cool !
we do our jobs , stick to the rules !
the rules say to react to all events appropriately .
shut your mouth !
professor , lars here .
the guards have beaten up bosch .
and i can' t reach jutta .
i don' t know what to do , it' s urgent !
no connection .
we' re going to take a little trip .
77 to the line !
77 and a guard attempted to attack the penitentiary .
thanks to the alertness of the guards ... ... this threat to the internal security could be prevented .
the guard has been suspended from duty .
he' s one of you now .
into the cell !
dora was worried about you , 77 .
we had a long talk .
i took her home .
nice place .
she smells so good .
i' il take care of her personally later on .
professor thon , this is against the law and violates human rights !
i demand to abort this experiment !
77 into the black box !
this is torture !
stop the experiment !
77 will stay in the black box until his behavior is corrected .
you stinking pig !
you coward !
you dirty , rotten , shitty fucking nazi pig !
come out !
are you finished ?
good .
into the black box !
look at me !
good evening , doctor .
please call professor thon .
what' s going on here ?
call him !
professor thon is unavailable .
nonsense !
what ?
this is just a test .
you don' t fool me !
this is just a test .
no , mr. berus !
the experiment is over now .
it has just been terminated .
bring her downstairs .
come along , doctor .
what do you think you' re doing ?
come !
don' t touch me !
everything !
no !
give me the coat .
undress !
everything , please .
well , jutta , you shave your pussy !
eckert , stop that !
go downstairs !
put this on .
it went well .
sometimes one just has to remind people of simple things .
lars here .
the guards have beaten up bosch .
and i can' t reach jutta .
i don' t know what to do , it' s urgent !
quickly , my car !
this mess you' il have to clean up yourself later , 82 .
out , the cell belongs to the lady !
listen !
whoever touches the tape ... ... will be sitting next to 82 .
this applies especially to the new prisoners !
how long this state of emergency lasts depends also on you !
don' t tell me about some stupid test !
they said no violence !
stay calm !
shit !
this is an emergency .
we' il wait until professor thon is back .
they want to see if we can keep it up .
i just can' t !
if you want to go , go !
no need to be afraid .
think about it !
i have to speak to mr. fahd !
it' s against the rules .
i insist or i' il call the police .
come on !
you' il see everything is okay .
i' il try to arrange a meeting with tarek .
but you must promise not to tell anyone .
take care of schutte !
schutte !
it' il be alright .
stop it !
unlock the cells , let the people out !
now !
he' s dead .
tarek , the man is dead .
we' re going out now .
we' re going through this door .
we can' t get out of here .
we don' t have a key for the elevator !
they' il just beat us up !
nonsense !
what' s back there ?
the basement .
supply corridors .
you can go directly to the medical school .
be quiet please or i' il get into trouble .
yeah , sure .
if you wait here for a moment , i' il see if i can get tarek .
would you like a cup of coffee ?
no , thank you .
fine .
do you have a cell phone ?
mine' s got no power .
thanks , i' il make it quick .
no !
to the left !
we can' t leave him lying there !
bosch !
you' re one of us !
stop them !
that' s an order !
you traitor pig !
i' il get you all !
they' re breaking out !
come !
i' il get you !
the back way !
mr. berus , please be reasonable !
shut up !
mr. kamps , the experiment ...
quiet !
tie them to the bars .
the others must be in the medical school .
there' s only one way out .
they don' t stand a chance .
mr. eckert , what happened here ?
i didn' t want this !
i wanted ...
i thought that ...
wait , bosch !
it' s over !
i have ...
can you hear me ?
there you are !
i told you , i' il get you !
on the floor , hands back !
no !
stop it !
give me the gun !
it' s not real anyway !
bitch !
the key , quick !
you started this !
you damned pig !
you killed schutte !
stop it .
it' s over !
the sad outcome : two dead , three injured ... ... among them project leader professor klaus thon .
obviously the experiment got out of control after two days .
the district attorney is investigating 2 cases of suspected manslaughter ... ... and several cases of mistreatment and failure to provide assistance .
one of the test persons has been arrested .
the project directors will probably have to answer to a court .
according to statements by one of the scientists involved ... ... the escalation could' ve been prevented ... ... by earlier aborting the experiment .
