there are procedures we need to go over .

we' re admitting your son .
you need to fill out the proper forms .

your son may need a transfusion .
we' il need to test you both for blood type .
we' re coming right back , baby .
wait a minute !
first name , mr archibald .
john .
middle initial ?
q. quincy .
name of your insurance company ?

is he okay ?
we don' t know .
they' re running tests .
we' re waiting to find the results .
is there anything we can do ?
your card , mr archibald .
i' m sorry .
your insurance card .
i' il need to make a copy for our files .
it' s okay .
you can go in now .
sweetheart .
how you doing , slugger ?
i can' t talk .
don' t worry about it .
get your rest .
we' re going to be out of here in a while .
we love you , son .
i love you , too .
what is all this ?
this ?
this is so we can monitor mike' s vitals .
respiratory rate , pulse oximetry , heart rate .
and this one is blood pressure ... diastolic and systolic .
we' d like this top number to stay above 90 .
if his blood pressure drops , we' re going to have to do something .
we can' t have him going below 70 again .
why ?
what would that mean , if he went below 70 again ?
70 and below , he' s in heart failure .
if you need anything .
thank you .
how' s the company insurance ?
he works part time .
she works as a grocery store clerk .
can we do anything ?
i got to go .
mr and mrs archibald .
i' m rebecca payne , hospital director .
hi there .
it' s nice to meet you .
this is dr turner , head of cardiology and michael' s doctor .
how do you do ?
good .
my wife .
how' s our boy doing ?
please sit down .
this x ray shows a normal nine year old' s heart .
this x ray is that of your son michael .
there are septal defects here , here , and here which have induced myopathy , resulting pulmonary edema , and malignant ventricular ectopy .
michael' s heart is approximately three times larger than normal size .
i' m sorry .
i didn' t understand what you said .
could you put that in layman terms ?
basically , there' s not enough blood being pumped by michael' s heart , so it backs up in the lungs like a sponge getting wet .
his heart is trying , but it' s working too hard .
what , does he need an operation , or ...
we' re considerably beyond corrective surgery , mr and mrs archibald .
mike' s heart is useless .
he' s going to need a transplant or he' s going to die .
wait a second .
there are other options .
what options ?
to do nothing .
medicate him .
make him feel as comfortable as possible .
you' re going to have to start thinking about quality of life now .
i don' t understand .
we were just with him and he seemed fine .
he' s going to seem fine , but as his heart gets worse , he will become increasingly fatigued , and he will sleep more and more , until one day he will fall asleep , and he won' t wake up .
i know this is difficult , but you have to face the fact that your son may not live much longer .
you might want to make it a happy time , say good bye .
god .
transplantation is a high risk operation .
you could lose your son on that table .
you might not want to take that chance .
if he doesn' t have the surgery ...
if he doesn' t have the surgery , how long would he live ?
not long .
months , weeks .
days .
come on .
all right .
come on , now .
i' m sorry .
this is a lot .
all right .
if he was your son , what would you do ?
i' d do the transplant , absolutely .
okay .
okay ?
let' s do that .
let' s do it .
first we' ve got to get mike' s name on the organ recipient list .
he' s b positive , so his name should go right to the top .
it' s not so simple .
there are other considerations before a recipient can be placed on a donor list .
transplant surgery is very expensive .
in most cases , prohibitively so .
we got insurance , major medical .
he' s covered .
we' ve already checked with your carrier , mr archibald .
there are no provisions in your policy for a procedure of this magnitude .
that' s a mistake .
not that you' re making a mistake .
i' m just saying that i' m insured .
my son' s covered .
mrs archibald , do you have coverage ?
no .
i' ve only been working at the supermarket a couple months .
you don' t get benefits until ...
doesn' t matter .
we got insurance .
i can see here that you don' t own your home .
you have no stocks , no bonds , no investments .
you have a little over $1, 000 in savings .
but we got insurance .
that may very well be .
you' re going to have to check with your carrier .
in the meantime , we' re going to have to treat this as a cash account .
what ?
how much does a transplant cost ?
wait a minute .
how much does it cost ?
transplant surgery , doctors ' fees , postoperative care , immunosuppressant drugs ... you' re looking at a minimum of $250, 000 .
if you opt for transplant surgery , that is your choice , but the hospital maintains a very strict policy with regard to cash patients .
we require down payment before we put a patient' s name on a receivers ' list .
how much ?
what kind of down payment ?
30 % ... $75, 000 . $75, 000 ...
to put my son' s name on a list .
our son is upstairs dying .
all you can do is talk about money ?
it costs money to provide health care .
it' s expensive for you , it' s expensive for us .
you' re going to have to guarantee payment before i can put your son' s name on the list .
mr and mrs archibald , please wait !
if you people don' t want to treat our son , we' il take him over to county memorial .
you don' t want to do that .
they have to treat him .
heart transplantation is always considered an elective procedure .
you' re in the right place .
what are we supposed to do ?
talk to your insurance company again .
check with our human resources department for medical assistance .
there' s money .
there' s children' s state services and medicaid .
you find a way to keep him here .
you just don' t take no for an answer .
your policy has changed , mr archibald .
changed to what ?
we' ve recently switched carriers from a ppo to an hmo .
it' s a less expensive policy .
unfortunately , there are some restrictions .
what kind of restrictions ?
here' s how it works .
non management part time employees such as yourself only qualify for second tier catastrophic coverage .
i' m not part time , i' m full time .
it' s just slow right now .
sure , but your coverage is based on hours worked .
like i said , you only qualify for second tier .
that has a maximum payout limit of $20, 000 .
what ?
you have been taking money out of my cheque every week .
i' ve been paying into this policy for years .
that' s why we' re going to cover you for the full $20, 000 .
you' re kidding me , right ?
come on .
you have dropped me from full time to part time .
you switched carriers .
now you' re telling me i' m not fully covered even though i got a policy that says i am ?
it doesn' t seem right , does it ?
no , it doesn' t .
my son is very sick .
if i' m not covered , i got a serious problem .
i understand that , but there' s nothing i can do .
you can file an appeal .
yeah ?
here you go .
that takes about seven working days .
says here you already have medical insurance .
not enough .
what little we have is already used up .
you on welfare ?
you should be on welfare .
we both have jobs .
that' s too bad .
i' m sorry .
i can' t help you .
try county medical .
yes , ma' am , i need to speak to somebody in financial aid .
no , i don' t want to hold .
i' ve been holding for 15 minutes .
we don' t have enough money !
should i get another job ?
i' m not yelling .
you' re yelling in here !
next , please .
wrong line .
window 15 .
what ?
window 15 .
no .
no , what ?
no , you don' t qualify .
my son is dying , i' m broke .
if i don' t qualify , who the hell does ?
i' m sorry .
i don' t need you to be sorry !
i need you to help me !
no , this is an appeal .
an appeal is for an already existing claim .
you needed to file a grievance .
you filed the wrong paperwork .
wait a minute .
you' re going to have to resubmit .
it could take 30 days .
i don' t have 30 days .
i know .
i' m getting sick of the run around .
i need my son' s name on that list .
your account is in excess of $30, 000 .
the hospital has bent over backwards to help you out .
is that right ?
yes , it is right .
but there is a limit to our generosity .
once and for all , your insurance does not cover this .
take it .
watch your step .
this thing is frigging heavy .
get out of the way .
friends , one among us is suffering in great pain today .
this is a good man .
' you can' t say that you' re not going to pitch . '
bernie frowned , puzzled by babe' s answer .
' okay , babe . " '
let us pray .
god of mercy , into his hands your son jesus christ commended his spirit at his last hour .
into those same hands , we commend your servant ...
you should try that news guy does all them special investigative reports .
you know the one , the guy with the frigging hair ?
pretty boy .
what' s his frigging name ?
lampley .
tuck lampley .
i' il give you $20 for the tv .
it' s a colour tv . $20 .
call him up , jimmy .
you don' t mind if we walk and talk .
i' m up to here today .
not at all .
what can i do you for ?
my son mike , he fell into heart failure at this little league game .
i got full insurance from the job .
now they' re telling me they won' t pay .
what about the hospital ?
don' t they have to cover it ?
that' s what i was saying .
they' re telling me i got to pay cash .
otherwise i got to take my son home and watch him die .
we was thinking you can do one of them special interest pieces .
send donations , write your congressman .
anything you can do , mr lampley , would help .
i think what' s happening to your son is outrageous .
i want to help .
i got to run this by my producers .
i got bosses like everybody else .
right .
leave your number with karen up front .
thank you very much .
give me $100 .
come on , it' s a diamond ring .
all right , $90 .
give me $90 , then .
he' s going to die .
what ?
they' re releasing him .
who ?
dr turner just left here .
they are releasing mike this morning .
they' re not going to send him home .
i gave them money yesterday .
it doesn' t matter .
listen to me .
they are releasing him .
i talked to the hospital .
they said ...
i' il take care of it .
you always take care of everything , but it' s never enough , is it ?
you need to do something , do you hear me ?
do something !
you' re doing great .
you really are .
you' ve gained what , five pounds ?
you' re the only patient i have who eats the food in this place .
doc , let me ask you something .
how long before i' m able to play tennis ?
you couldn' t play before you had a new heart .
take up knitting .
i play tennis .
we don' t care .
would you please get back to work ?
thank you .
heidi , make an appointment for us to have dinner next week .
i' m going to cook .
no , and you' re not wearing lingerie around him the next month .
you' re not in his will .
he told me .
don' t push your luck .
i gave the hospital $6, 000 yesterday .
can i talk to you ?
yes , sure .
take care of him .
take care .
thank you .
my wife denise says you' re going to send michael home .
is that true ?
i' m a physician .
i don' t make policy decisions .
that' s handled by the board of trustees .
you' re the head of cardiac surgery .
you make a recommendation , they' re going to listen , aren' t they ?
i make recommendations all the time .
the final decision rests with the board .
that' s it ?
send him home .
i' m afraid so .
can we take a little walk ?
it won' t take long , i promise you .
fine .
i' m looking at the brochure last night .
it says this hospital does over 300 heart surgeries a year .
300 surgeries , $250, 000 a pop .
you know how much that is ?
i did the math .
that' s $75 million worth of heart surgeries .
you' re telling me you can' t do one for me in good faith ?
i waived my fee in your son' s case .
i know you' re not asking ...
nobody asked you to waive the fee .
i can raise the money .
i already came up with $22, 000 , and i swear to god on my life
i will pay for this if you give me the opportunity .
i' m only getting 20 hours on the job .
i can do this .
i can pay .
i swear to god , i' il pay you the money back .
i don' t know how , but i promise you i will .
trust me .
i give you my word as a man .
please .
could you take your hands off me , please ?
i' ve done everything i can .
i' m sorry .
no , you haven' t .
yes .
let' s go inside and talk about it .
i' m not asking anymore , doctor .
i' m telling you .
you are going to give my son a new heart , you understand me ?
don' t move .
don' t even think about it .
put your hands down .
mr archibald , i ...
shut up .
i know how upset you are , but this is not the way to handle it .
you can' t go through this way .
put your hands up .
put them up .
oh , god .
give me your gun .
i don' t have a gun .
they don' t have guns .
they' re not armed .
all right .
put your hands down .
sit down .
no , get up .
you fail to realise the jeopardy ...
get over here .
shut up !
we have got to talk about this .
shut up .
don' t move .
john , wait .
just stop .
stop !
if you do this , you' re on an irreversible course of action .
put on the brakes and think about this .
we really need to talk .
mr archibald , i hope ...
back up , please .
what ?
do as he says .
would you please back up ?
what are you doing ?
i' m not taking no for an answer .
back up .
that guy' s got a gun !
stay right there .
what are you doing ?
get back over there .
sit on your hands over there !
get over there !
turner , everybody , get down !
sit on your hands !
put your hands under your butt !
don' t anybody move .
what are you doing ?
i' m bleeding .
trying to get my goddamned finger sewn back on .
mr archibald , these people have nothing to do with this .
let them go .
they need treatment .
this is a hospital .
you' re a doctor .
why don' t you treat them ?
start with him .
what' s the matter , doctor ?
you want to see his insurance card first ?
i' il do it .
okay , you do it .
wait a minute .
i got a pregnant wife here .
listen , all right , wait .
listen , everybody .
the hospital' s under new management now .
from now on , free health care for everybody .
how' s that ?

you got keys for that elevator ?
yeah .
i want you to kill the power .

keep an eye on him , max .
you got to sit still .
i can' t do this with you moving around .

dr turner , we' re going to need your hand .
i just bought this suit .
can you give me a hand ?

thank you .
i can' t handle a gut shot .
i' m a cardiac surgeon , not an emergency room physician .
it' s like riding a bike , doctor .

this is apples and oranges .
i can' t .
the man is dying .
help him .
i' d like to .
i haven' t done this ...

75 milligrams demerol i. v. , lidocaine 2 % local .
i' il scrub now .
when i get out of here , i' m suing this hospital and your security company .
what makes you so sure you' re getting out at all ?
right behind you !
here we go .
you' ve got to stand behind the line , sir .
move this out of here for me , please ?
thank you very much .
lieutenant , we got a real problem here .
what' s that ?
this guy' s in for the long haul ...
locked down the e. r. , barricaded himself in , killed power in the elevators .
we can bust down the door , but this son of a bitch might start killing people .
there' s two pinpoint cameras hidden in the e. r.
the hospital' s own surveillance .
we got a video tap being set up .
are you in charge of security ?
no , that would be wally pitoniak .
he' s at home .
it' s his day off .
not anymore , it ain' t .
get him here .
all right , can you get me a secure line ?
we' ve got one of our guys inside .
he' s got a walkie talkie .
you might want to try this .
put a clamp on all phone lines to the emergency room .
if this guy picks up the phone , i want him talking to me .
done .
who' s in charge here ?
rebecca payne , sir .
it' s her day off , too .
jesus christ , does anybody work at this hospital ?
it' s saturday , sir .
so what ?
people get sick on saturday , don' t they ?
seor , no cry .

where you going to take her ?
examination room there .

just remember , it ain' t your fault .
excuse me .
i think my fiance might have broken her arm .
i was wondering if we could get somebody to look at her .
sure .
what happened ?
a drunk ran a red light ...
ran a red light .
he slammed into us .
right ?
it was an accident .
yes , it was .
this is the police depantment .
i' m speaking to the man in charge .
please pick up the walkie talkie .
the building is surrounded .
there' s no way in or out .
if you hear me .
i advise you to respond .
hello .
is anyone there ?
this is lieutenant frank grimes of the chicago police department .
are you the man in charge ?
that' s right .
who am i speaking to ?
john ...
q.
all right , john q.
again , i' m lieutenant grimes , but i want you to call me frank .
can you do that ?
sure , frank .
i' il be the hostage negotiator .
i' ve been a cop for 35 years .
this is all i do .
i don' t play games .
i don' t fool around .
if i say something , you can take it to the bank .
let' s get down to it .
is anybody hurt ?
it' s an emergency room .
everybody' s hurt .
right .
they' re fine .
good .
as long as it stays that way , we can keep talking .
what is it you want ?
find rebecca payne , hope memorial' s administrative supervisor .
you find her .
tell her i want my kid' s name on the donors ' list .
kid boy or girl ?
a boy .
i got two boys myself .
two girls and two boys .
don' t handle me .
i don' t want to be handled .
it insults my intelligence as a human being !
take it easy .
the idea is not to get too excited , all right ?
i' m going to take it any way i can get it , understand ?
if i don' t get it , there' s going to be some dead bodies on your hands in here .
i hear you loud and clear .
i' m going to jot that down .
rebecca payne , right ?
all right .
there' s a lot of cops out here , john .
are you sure you want to go through with this ?
i' m sure .
all right , sit tight .
you' re in a tough spot , a lot of trouble .
if you work with me , if you' re reasonable , we' il figure a way out of this , okay ?
we have to have a little faith in one another .
why is that , frank ?
why ?
because that' s what faith' s all about ... believing when you don' t want to believe .
besides , what else are you going to do ?
i want my epidural .
too late for that .
something for the pain .
out !
she' il be fine .
first child ?
yeah .
just kind of nervous .
you know how it is .
i was , too .
what do you want , a boy or a girl ?
doesn' t matter to me , man , as long as my kid' s healthy .
that' s all i want .
listen , i didn' t mean anything by that .
who was driving ?
the car ... who was driving ?
i was .
what' s that got to do with anything ?
why is your girl all banged up and you' re not ?
what do you call this ?
what are you laughing at ?
somebody get this fool a band aid .
i don' t want you to bleed to death .
screw you .
that shit hurts .
his air bag went off and mine didn' t .
what kind of car you drive ?
mercedes 500 .
you drive a mercedes 500 ?
what year ?
1986 .
it' s a classic .
mercedes didn' t make passenger side air bags till 1988 .
busted .
what' s your point , john ?
what' s yours , mitch ?
you from the slap a ho tribe .
you like to beat on that young lady , and everybody here knows it .
i was drunk , all right ?
don' t smoke in here , mitch .
give me a break .
work with me here .
i' m trying my best .
mr q , could i get some water ?
i need to tinkle .
i got missed meal cramps .
i' m hungry .
let' s get a bucket of chicken or something .
in a minute .
how' s it going in there ?
he' s going to make it .
you have any idea how much blood this guy lost ?
it' s incredible .
he saved this man' s life .
what' s that ?
lasix .
it' s a diuretic to help get rid of some of the fluid build up .
it' s potassium depleting , so he needs this one to supplement .
and those ?
dopamine for his blood pressure , dig for his heart , primacor .
it seems like so much .
yeah , it' s a lot .
this is antibiotic .
what for ?
it' s prophylactic , just in case .
and those ?
these two ?
they' re for pain .
i don' t feel so good .
this is going to make you feel yucky for a few minutes , buddy .
i' m going to get you some of those crunchy ice chips you want .
how does that sound ?
mike , by the way , there was this guy , he stopped by to see you .
he said he was a friend of yours .
i got him right here .
i didn' t know if i should let him in .
what do you think ?
he' s okay .
he' s okay ?
said he wanted to hang out with you .
he' s okay .
that' s great .
thank you .
oh , my baby !
let me hold my baby !
mom ?
is dad coming ?
yeah , he' s coming .
when ?
where is he ?
i don' t know , but he' s coming .
what are you up to ?
never mind me .
you' re worthless .
some security guard .
you should have zapped the bastard when you had the chance .
with what ?
besides , i' m not sticking my neck on the line for $8 . 50 an hour .
pay dirt .
are you nuts ?
what the hell are you doing ?
looking out for number one .
you want to stay alive , sit tight and wait for the cavalry to get here .
the cops are coming in shooting .
they don' t care about his kid .
once he realises that , we' re all history .
if he catches you with that scalpel , you' re the one that' s history , asshole .
he don' t look so bad to me .
ethyl chloride . " just like mace .
put that stuff back before you get us in trouble .
you listen , you stupid rent a cop .
i am not a slob .
i have a life .
it means something to me .
i' m not going down in this shit hole .
no , sir .
back it up .
how are you ?
how you all doing ?
good .
how are you ?
how are you , fellows ?
is it true the man inside wants an operation for his son ?
everything good ?
good to see you .
do you know what weapon he has ?
you' il talk to me , right ?
i' il let you know when i know , okay ?
you' il be the first .
i' il let you know later .
gus , how are you ?
how you doing , frank ?
it' s hot .
yeah , it is .
a little early for heavy artillery , isn' t it ?
maybe .
maybe not .
you should tell me .
what' s going on ?
you' re looking at it .
a very upset father inside .
we' il give him a couple of minutes to cool off .
let' s not give him too much time .
let' s end this quick and quiet .
that' s the plan .
all right .
good .
in that case , i' m just here to lend my support in any way that i can .
i don' t need a babysitter on this .
it' s under control .
is it ?
yes .
all right .
can' t have people running around the street using guns .
makes it look like the city' s unsafe .
besides , i got to be here .
chief doesn' t show up , looks like he' s asleep at the wheel .
just stay out of my way .
the tv cameras are over there .
they should make you feel right at home .
right .
why don' t you just relax ?
why can' t you relax ?
i' m fine .
why don' t you just do your job ?
i' m doing my job .
we' re both cops , right ?
we' re on the same side , remember ?
right .
right ?
it' s good to see you .
thanks .
yes , mr mayor .
i' il see you in a little bit .
no , we got it .
i got it .
how are you ?
the old man , looking for his depends .
he leave them over here ?
what i don' t understand is why they never found it , the doctors .
my son has had clean checkups every year since the day he was born .
how could the doctors not pick it up ?
he might not have been tested enough .
why not ?
you got an hmo , right ?
there' s your answer .
hmos pay their doctors not to test .
it' s their way of keeping costs down .
say mike did need additional testing and insurance says they won' t cover them .
the doctor keeps his mouth shut , and come christmas , the hmo sends the doctor a fat ass bonus cheque .
is that true ?
possible .
not likely , but possible .
these doctors may have known what was wrong with my son , and they could have treated him all along ?
who knows ?
i don' t know .
don' t take this personal , doc .
you' re a bunch of crooks .
you don' t know what you' re talking about .
what about that thing you take ?
the thing ?
that promise .
it' s called the hippocratic oath .
more like the hypocritical oath .
how' s it go , doc ?
i solemnly swear to take care of the sick and damn near dying , unless they ain' t got major medical .
something like that ?
you' ve got it perfectly .
it' s funny , but it' s not far from the truth .
this shit happens all the time .
paramedics bring in some accident victim .
when the boys in accounting find out they can' t pay , they send them packing .
hospitals can' t turn people away .
isn' t there laws against that ?
there' s also ways around those laws .
we have to stabilise them .
after that , we' re off the hook .
that' s not how it works .
that' s exactly how it works .
maybe not on the fifth floor , but in here if you don' t have money , you get a band aid , a foot in the ass , and you' re out the door .
enough already .
i' ve heard all the bitching and moaning i can stand for one day .
if you all want to regard me as some kind of blood sucking vampire , great .
i' il be the bad guy .
but who' s holding the fucking gun ?
sir ?
lieutenant !
this is frank grimes .
you pick up the phone , you get me .
what can i do for you ?
what' s going on with the list ?
i' m working on it , but i need time .
time i don' t have .
let' s talk about the hostages .
what do you want to know ?
what' s going on ?
how are they ?
they' re fine .
they' re full .
we' re eating candy bars and discussing hmos , waiting for you .
i want you to let some of them go .
for what ?
i do for you , you do for me .
show some good faith .
a lot of nervous people out here .
make everybody breathe a lot easier if we saw some happy faces .
i' il do for you when you start doing for me .
i want my kid' s name on that list .
i' m not kidding around here .
good faith .
good faith only takes you so far ...
what' s that ? ... merit system .
so far , you haven' t earned any points .
excuse me .
i need to talk to you .
this woman is six centimetres dilated .
the baby is breeched .
i' ve medicated her , but we have to move her up to maternity immediately .
hang on , frank .
right down here .
what the hell is going on ?
do you know this man ?
his name is john archibald .
he has a son here in icu .
put people on the door .
find the mother .
i need to talk to her .
are you there , frank ?
i' m here , john .
i changed my mind , all right ?
i' m going to let some of the hostages go .
that' s the right thing .
but when i do , the clock starts , you understand ?
it' s 4 : 15 .
you got one hour .
you got till 5 : 15 , you understand ?
if my boy' s not on that list by 5 : 15 , somebody in here is going to die .
don' t be stupid .
5 : 15 , frank !
5 1 5 , something happens for me !
got it .
you' re a cop .
call the coroner .
this is bad , frank .
this has just got to go away .
all right , miriam ...
and rosa .
vamos .
let' s go .
mr archibald , please let my husband come with me .
i need you to get out of here .
i will be okay .
just go .
shit , i' il go .
i' m free .
steve , baby , no , please .
what kind of man are you ?
screw you , tyrone .
what ?
screw me , tyrone ?
wait a second .
wait a minute .
just relax .
that' s right , tough guy .
julie , baby .
get the gun !
come on !
go over there and pick up that gun .
shoot him !
shoot him right in the face , julie !
get up !
get the gun !
there you go , baby .
what are you ... are you crazy ?
what are you doing ?
come on now !
max , you got cuffs ?
oh , god !
you stupid bitch !
that' s for beating the shit out of me !
and that' s for being an asshole !
and this , this is for calling me a bitch !
i felt that one .
and i' m not going to be your barbie anymore !
goddamn !
all that ass and muscles to go with it .
i knew damn well you wasn' t no blonde .
give them to me .
mitch !
look at me !
come here .
let' s go , both of you .
whatever happens , i want you to know everything' s going to be okay .
you understand me ?
yes .
don' t worry .
don' t worry about anything .
i' il always be there for you , baby .
don' t shoot !
i' m letting some hostages go !
don' t shoot !
all right , steve .
you , too .
let' s go , both of you .
thank you .
muchas gracias .
seor .
thank you , mr archibald .
you , too .
take care of his ear .
the gunman has just freed several hostages . who will immediately be debriefed by members of the crisis team .
will the man known as john q get a heant for his little boy ?
only time will tell .
from hope memorial hospital .
i' m tuck lampley .
is it true an ambulance dropped off a victim after the gunman took over ?
he unlocked the door and he let him inside !
can you comment ?
the man was critically injured .
if he hadn' t let him in , he would have died .
ma' am , are you all right ?
i feel good .
we' re having a baby !
ma' am , any comments about the gunman ?
john q very good man .
the gunman ?
very good man !
they got a camera .
they' re watching a video feed .
how do you know ?
they' re looking at something .
i want to know what .
can you get it ?
boss , if they got it , i can get it .
you give in , there' s going to be guns in every hospital in the country .
you think mr archibald' s the only one who has a sick child ?
have you checked the hlv ward ?
there' s a whole floor full .
people get sick .
they die .
that' s the way it goes .
i' m faced with decisions like this every day .
there' s a man threatening innocent people because you refused to help his son .
there are 50 million people in this country without medical insurance .
if you' d like to change it , call your congressman .
excuse me .
why don' t we just tell him his son' s name' s on the list ?
doesn' t that make sense ?
how' s he going to know , anyway ?
sir ?
pardon me .
can you come take a look at this ?
sarge , chief moroe , this is wally pitoniak , head of security .
nice to meet you .
i got your spot .
here' s your sight .
that' s going to be your perch .
the x there , that' s your phone .
which phone ?
bring it up , jeff .
the phone right there .
it is .
tom .
but chief moroe maintains the police will do whatever is necessary to preserve the lives and safety of these hostages .
thanks .
tuck .
this country , man .
can' t go anywhere anymore without getting mugged or murdered or stabbed .
kids killing their classmates .
drive bys .
i won' t even go into a post office .
shut up , mitch .
you shut up .
i hate the little bastard , but he' s right .
you know how easy it is to get a gun ?
five minutes .
gun show .
i understand your kid is sick , john , but what makes him better than me ?
i got a life , too .
but you got insurance .
so what , are you going to shoot me ?
that' s what you' re telling the cops .
if your son doesn' t get the very first heart available , we all die .
how' s it going to end , john ?
what' s your move ?
i got no moves , okay ?
i don' t know what i' m going to do .
i' m waiting on a miracle , okay ?
i' m waiting on an act of god .
could we have a word with you , please ?
this is all my fault .
when the hospital told me they were releasing mikey ,
i called john and yelled at him , told him to do something , anything .
but i never thought ...
i understand .
is he a violent man , mrs archibald ?
no !
he' s sweet and gentle .
he wouldn' t hurt a fly .
that' s not what he' s saying .
he' s talking about killing people .
i may be fishing , but has he spent time in the military or anything like that ?
what is this ?
what ?
i see what' s going on here .
you' re trying to get me to say something you can use against my husband .
he' s in a lot of trouble .
we' re going to need you to talk to him .
let' s get something straight , mister .
you cannot use me to build a case against my husband .
i support him in everything he does .
i' m on his side , not yours .
and you don' t talk to me !
i would tell you what i think of you ... ... but i' m a christian woman .
now you two leave me alone .
i have a sick child to look after .
i' ve decided to put michael' s name on the recipient list .
the hospital will pay for everything .
really ?
really .
thank you .
oh , god , thank you .
you' re good .
excuse me ?
quite the performance .
what are you talking about ?
comforting embrace , sincere look .
for a minute , i actually believed you cared .
we go now to hope memorial hospital .
live ...
tuck lampley .
as you can see .
the crowd in front of hope memorial is growing .
the s. w. a. t. team has arrived .
the situation is becoming tense .
standing next to me is james palumbo . friend of john archibald .
mr palumbo .
what can you tell us about john archibald ?
you know .
i got to be honest .
tuck .
this whole thing sucks .
it all could have been avoided so incredibly easy .
none of this had to happen if john had been a frigging millionaire or if his last name was rockefeller . but sometimes john don' t get it .
he don' t understand that what we hold sacred in this country isn' t values .
it' s value that' s important .
we got haves .
we got have nots .
we' ve got white collar . blue collar .
and no collar .
inside there we got surgery . outpatient surgery .
out of luck surgery .
there' s a lot of people out there who don' t got 250 grand in their billfold .
to shame a man like that and back him into a corner . seems to me that something is out of whack .
not someone .
but what do i know ?
i' m a factory worker .
i see this is making you upset . but if you could look into the camera and speak to john q right now . what would you say to him ?
i' m there with you . and you take care .
that' s one man' s opinion .
live at the crisis at hope memorial . this is tuck lampley .
what' s going on ?
where' s everybody ?
we' re sending one of our guys in through the air duct .
if we can get the target to this phone , we got a clear shot .
is that right ?
yes , lieutenant , that is right .
when you' re ready , chief .
my wife' s calling .
worse than that .
it' s father time .
come over here !
not one word .
i don' t want to hear it .
you' re going behind my back !
what do you want from me ?
look at the clock !
look at your watch !
the guy said at a quarter after , he' s going to start killing people .
this is so goddamned stupid !
what' s your great idea ?
there are no great ideas , especially this !
i got a shot at this guy , i' m going to take it .
you know the drill .
always take the open shot .
the wife has agreed to speak to him .
let her talk him down .
that' s exactly what i' m going to do .
you used the wife to set him up ?
i' m going to use whatever works .
let me paint a picture for you .
what we have is a lose/ lose .
this guy starts whacking hostages , that' s bad .
if we give into this asshole , it' s also bad .
bad for who ?
everybody .
me , you , everybody .
it' s an election year .
however it goes down , this guy' s not going to make it .
you kill him , that' s a p. r. bonanza ?
i can live with one dead bad guy .
what i can' t live with is one innocent person being hurt , not on my watch .
you know what , frank ?
you' re out !
i' m out ?
you' re officially relieved of duty .
i' m going to handle this now .
you ?
me .
you think it' s my first time around the dance floor ?
how do you think i got these ?
and watch it .
i got a lot of pressure on me .
there' s a lot of eyes watching .
someone' s got to make the call .
you' re not going to do it , are you ?
i' il do it .
what about the hostages , the human beings ?
better keep their heads down .
great .
what is it ?
the air conditioning just turned off .
i' m counting on you .
don' t let me down , okay ?
i' il call you !
right on .
excuse me .
sorry .
don' t touch me !
excuse me .
thank you .
tuck lampley , channel 8 ?
right .
you got it .
thanks , officer !
excuse me .
where' s my picture ?
i got to unscramble the police encryption .
we' re almost there .
hurry up .
i got a contact in cardiology .
the cops are going to set up a call between this guy and his wife .
are you with the wife ?
all right , let' s patch it through .
this better be good , frank .
god , baby .
we' re on the list .

mikey' s name is on the list .

this is going to end up bad for you .
there' s only two ways out of here .
jail or dead .
my son is very sick and he needs some help .
it' s hard to be a man these days , hard to know what the right thing is .
but put the gun down , john .
you' re not hearing me , frank !
my son is sick !
that' s it !
there' s nothing else .
end of story .
when people are sick , they deserve a little help .
sick , help .
i am not going to bury my son !
my son is going to bury me .
you think these people give a shit about you ?
they don' t .
you' re just the cause of the moment .
nobody cares .
that' s the real truth .
nobody cares .
only you .
and it' s only you and me out here and all these guns pointed at you .
what do you want to do ?
it' s your call .
i want my son .
i want my son inside with me .
can' t do it , john !
you give me my boy , i give you your sniper .
it' s all over .
you bring my son ,
i give up ... ... everybody goes home .
everybody' s safe .
you bring me my son .
come on .
all right .
what do you think , frank ?
give it to him .
he' s not going to hurt anybody with his boy in there .
the object is to get hostages out , not bring them in .
it' s not a hostage .
it' s his son .
have all these people been on the news ?
it' s your call , frank .
all right , give it to him .
hold it !
no , listen to me .
i' m his mother .
i need to be in there !
stop !
stop right there !
go !
beat it !
now !
we' re in trouble .
mike' s blood pressure has dropped into the mid 40s .
his atrial blood pressure should be in the low teens .
it' s 35 .
i' m sorry , john .
without a new heart , he' s not going to make it .
then take mine .
what ?
you heard me .
take my heart , and you put it in mike .
you done lost your damn mind .
you can' t be serious .
you bet i' m serious .
i' m dead serious .
oh , my god .
you' il be dead .
and my son will live .
you can' t do this .
it' s the only way .
physically , you can' t do this .
i kill myself .
you open me up , take my heart .
it' s perfect .
that' s just crazy .
we can' t just remove your heart and put it into michael' s body .
there are too many unknowns .
matching donor and recipient is extremely complicated .
critical tests have to be taken .
like what ?
cross matches for blood type , chest cavity measurements .
if blood tissues are not completely compatible ...
i know about compatibility .
we' ve been tested up the wazoo .
we' re both b positive .
our tissues match .
his heart' s three times the size of normal , so mine will fit .
you know we' re compatible .
out of the question .
too risky .
i' m telling you he will make it !
can' t do it .
if i' m laying dead , you' re not going to take my heart and save his life ?
you' il let two die instead of one because of a technicality ?
i think what john is trying to do is right .
me , too .
i think it' s so brave .
what do you think mike would want ?
what about your wife ?
mike' s too young to know what' s good for him .
it' s my job to protect him .
denise would do the same thing .
i know what' s happening to mike is bad .
matter of fact , it' s the worst .
but killing yourself ain' t going to solve a damn thing .
sometimes you just got to let go and let god ...
just accept it , brother .
accept it ?
accept what ?
that mike is going to die .
no , i don' t accept that .
ever .
i reject that out of hand .
all right , he' s a patient to you , i understand , but he' s a good kid .
he loves bodybuilding .
he wants to be a bodybuilder .
can you believe that ?
he' s funny .
you' d like him .
you' d like him if you got to know him .
i do like him .
then , please , i' m just begging you , step outside the rules .
i' d like to , john , i really would , but what you' re asking crosses the line .
it is completely unethical .
i' m crossing the line ?
you' re crossing .
the whole system is crossing the line .
maybe you don' t understand what i' m talking about .
i don' t give a damn .
my son' s going to live .
maybe you haven' t figured that out by now .
i' il do whatever i got to do for him to live .
what are you going to do , shoot me if i don' t operate ?
i' m going to kill myself .
all right ?
let' s just see what happens .
that' s what this is about , right ?
he needs a donor .
somebody' s got to die for him to live .
i' m his father .
it' s me .
all right .
all right what ?
i' il do it , if that' s what you want .
you' re going to let him kill himself ?
once he' s dead , why not ?
you are the finest surgeon i have ever known .
you cannot throw your career , your life away for this .
if you do this , you' re finished .
what are they going to do , sue me ?
disbar me ?
evict me from the country club ?
this is still a hospital .
if there' s a heart available , i' m not going to let it go to waste .
doctor , mr maguire , let' s get ready for surgery .
they' re ready to harvest .
all right , hurry up , guys .
get her on the table .
what' s our time ?
all right , ready to lift .
count of three .
oh four five .
scalpels laid out .
where' s his tray ?
got the other one ready ?
bring the cart around , please .
what do we have ?
female donor , 26 years old .
she is 26 years old , 5' 7 " .
liver , kidneys usable .
liver and kidneys are both usable .
lungs ?
lungs are okay .
heart ?
heart is good .
blood type ?
b positive .
this is my ... ... my will .
it says i' m leaving my heart to my son , and i need two witnesses to sign .
i' m not signing it .
i ain' t going to watch you kill yourself .
me , neither .
the sooner you sign it , the sooner you go home .
i' il sign .
me , too .
you' re just going to go in there and off yourself ?
only one thing will stop me .
what' s that ?
if mitch is b positive .
type o. swear to god .
thank you .
you be good .
be careful .
see you in the funny papers .
can i have a word with him ?
thank you .
how you doing , buddy ?
did you find me a new heart ?
we got you one .
i guess you got a guardian angel .
just try to stay awake for a minute , okay ?
i just need to tell you a few things .
you always listen to your mother .
you understand ?
do what she tells you to do .
she' s your best friend .
you tell her you love her every day .
you' re too young for girls right now , but ... ... there' s going to come a time .
when it does , you treat them like princesses .
' cause that' s what they are .
when you say you' re going to do something ...
when you say you' re going to do something , you do it .
because your word is your bond , son .
it' s all you have .
and money .
you make money if you get a chance , even if you got to sell out once in a while .
make as much money as you can .
don' t be stupid like your father .
everything is so much easier with money , son .
don' t smoke .
be kind to people .
when somebody chooses you ...
we talked about this .
you stand up .
you be a man .
you stay away from the bad things , son , please .
don' t get caught up in the bad things .
there' s so many great things out there for you .
i' il never leave you .
i' m always with you .
right there .
i love you , son .
i' il see you later .
turner gets the other one .
match with donor .
oh , my sweet jesus .
let' s do it .
wait a minute .
are you telling me that gun was empty the whole time ?
i' m all talk .
the only one i ever considered killing was me .
maybe we should get some towels .
you' re not going to believe this .
we got a match .
b positive .
michael william archibald , the only status one in the country .
i' il be damned .
i' m thirsty .
we have very good news .
jesus .
the safety' s on .

tumultuous day .
there they are .

they appear to be unharmed but centainly exhausted from what must have been an excruciating ordeal .

police are esconting them one by one to safety .
how do you feel ?
somebody else is coming .
it' s john q.

he' s putting the gun down .
he appears to be surrendering .
the police are approaching cautiously now .
and they' ve got him .
they' ve subdued john q.
the handcuffs are on . and it appears to be over .
it' s all over .
if pictures speak a thousand words . then these images do speak volumes .
and now .
as the bloody standoff comes to an end .
we remind you that channel 8 news was here first with exclusive moment to moment live coverage of " crisis at hope memorial .

the other big story ...
john q goes on trial today for kidnapping and attempted murder charges all because an hmo denied coverage for his son' s heant transplant . ... more expensive for you in the future .
hmos .
to deny coverage ...
there are still 40 million americans who are uninsured ...
tonight .
as the trial continues .
john quincy archibald ... vigilante or heroic father ? ... is to sue the pants off them for millions of dollars to let them know ...
we have known foryears this is a crappy health care system .
we' ve known we had to do something ...
john q was using one of those faith based health care plans .
you just pray . and the government does nothing . ... not agree with that ?
the point is . the enemy we' re trying to identify is us .
we are the ones who shot down national health care .
we are the ones who don' t want our taxes raised .
you have to look in the mirror for this problem .
back up .
come on .
just one question , please !
how' s your son doing , john ?
a statement , please !
out of the way .
let' s go .

quiet , please .
sentencing will be one week from today .

the judge is not going to give him more than three to five .
i' il try and get it down to two .
i' m sorry .
