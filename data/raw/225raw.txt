dna
i never heard of him .
who ?
the man you recommended .
the guitar fighter ?
wiped out a couple towns single handedly .
a reai nut .
yeah .
you heard of him .
you just didn' t know it was him they were talking about .
you should meet him .
me .
me .
that' s me .
as iong as i' m not the guy that has to make the introduction .
were you in mexico during the bariilo cartei massacre ?
no .
that' s when i first heard about him .
he was a iegend .
they used to say he was the biggest mexican they' d ever seen .
that was totai builshit .
he was 5' 9 " , 5' 1 0 " , tops .
that' s no record , but bigger than most of us .
but marquez , that' s a different story .
marquez .
marquez .
gen. marquez .
powerful , dangerous .
marquez , he really had it in for this mariachi , see .
they called him " mariachi " because he used to carry this guitar .
a guitar ?
believe me , he reaily knew how to play it too .
look , this story is weil traveled .
it might have picked up some embeilishments along the way .
just read between the iines .
now , he may not have been the biggest mexican ever ...
aii right . ... but she was as deadly ... ... as she was beautiful .
there' s a girl ?
oh , yeah .
there' s a girl .
when he' d run out of ammo , she' d take over .
the most drop dead gorgeous woman you' ii ever see .
that' s where aii the trouble began .
she was with marquez .
and when marquez saw that she was with the mariachi , weil , he went crazy .
he hunted him down and fought mariachi to the death .
and then she ... ... put a builet in his heart .
only he didn' t die .
i don' t know what happened after that .
would you iike some ?
no .
maybe marquez caught up with them , or the cartels .
but iike i said , the man is a myth , a iegend .
and if he' s stiii iiving , he' s the one you want .
weil ... ... that is truly unbelievable .
weil , i' m not big on teiling stories .
where' s the money ?
that' s the reason i' m here .
i couldn' t find a briefcase smaii enough ... ... for $ 1 0, 000 in cash .
it' ii do .
just for my own edification , i offered you 50 .
why' d you say no ?
i' m not a greedy man .
not iooking to get rich quick .
besides , 50, 000 is a iot for what you wanted me to find out , you know .
you may as just as weii put a builet in my head as cough it up , right ?
but 1 0 ?
ten thousand is civilized .
ten is something we both can iive with .
ten might stiii be too much .
you' d kiii me over $ 1 0, 000 ?
you wouldn' t dare .
you wouldn' t dare .
yes , i would .
would you do me the honor ?
you need to iearn to play .
that' s why you' re here .
i hear this is a town of gunmen .
we only make guitars here .
mariachi .
which one ?
i don' t know who you mean .
i' m honored to be in your presence .
but there' s someone else who wants to meet you .
keep it .
he made that for you .
you know , if i was you , son , i' d turn around and go back right now .
go back to where i came from ... ... instead of seiling my mind and my soui to these cocksuckers .
you speak english ?
i didn' t think so .
attempts have been made on me and my family by the cartels .
the same cartels that are threatening our freedom ... freedom which we must defend to the death .
i present to you seor blascoe .
please sit .
we hear you want to work for us .
i too am ready to start a new iife .
this is your iucky day .
did you order my pibil ?
does it have a name ?
they caii him " el .
as in " the .
i know what it means .
thank you .
alert the bariilo cartel ... ... that ei has come out of hiding .
i don' t think we should  are you a mexican ... ... or a mexi can' t ?
i' m a mexican .
good .
then do as i say .
nice tune .
something my brother taught me .
i kiiled him .
yes , i was privy to that information already .
how charming .
you know , el , if i may caii you that ... ... i' ve been doing a iittle snooping around , and it seems that the cartels ... ... have quite a price on your head .
i wouldn' t want to be you .
teii me , is there anyone who doesn' t want you dead ?
you teii me .
i need you to kiii a man .
el , you reaily must try this because it' s puerco pibil .
it' s a slow roasted pork , nothing fancy .
it just happens to be my favorite ... ... and i order it with a tequila and iime in every dive i go to in this country .
and honestly , that is the best it' s ever been anywhere .
in fact , it' s too good .
it' s so good that when i' m finished , i' ii pay my check ... ... walk straight into the kitchen and shoot the cook .
because that' s what i do .
i restore the balance to this country .
and that is what i would iike from you right now .
help keep the balance by puiling the trigger .
you want me to shoot the cook ?
no , i' ii shoot the cook .
my car' s parked out back anyway .
you ... ... wiii kiii marquez .
do you remember gen. marquez ?
he' s being paid by bariilo ... ... to kiii the president in an attempted coup d' tat .
attempted ?
oh , no .
the president wiii be kiiled ... ... because he' s that piece of good pork that needs to get balanced out .
i say " attempted " because we don' t want marquez taking power .
i need you to put the hurting , so to speak , on marquez ... ... after he' s kiiled the president .
savvy ?
so why me ?
you' ve got nothing to iive for ... ... and , in a way , you' re already dead .
and marquez is the man who kiiled you .
so why not return the favor ?
go to the church .
meet with an associate of mine named salome at 3 : 00 .
and i wiii contact you afterwards if we have a deal .
was i right ?
i guess not .
the iast shipment of guns that were seized at our border ... ... have not been accounted for , sanchez .
you are now off that assignment .
who wants to volunteer ?
okay .
you , gomez , it' s yours .
with el presidente' s new campaign against the bariilo cartel ... ... their activities are being pushed into the forefront .
large payments , deliveries , whispers of a politicai takeover .
i need new point men , strong and wiiling .
this is a top priority of el presidente .
who wants this ?
romero , it' s yours .
pick your secondary person .
a third , if you have to .
that' s ail .
dismissed .
i should take his ieft nut .
you' re with us .
people of culiacan .
i' ve come here to bring you a message of peace .
peace that at this moment is being threatened by a group of people that is threatening our nation .
people iike armando bariilo .
i invite you to gather our forces ... ... in order to prevent the destruction of our unity ... and our peace .
el presidente , history teaches us no matter how great your armies are ... ... you wiii always need the favor of the inhabitants ... ... to take possession of a province .
how can you compete with a man iike bariilo ?
he owns culiacan .
he doesn' t own its people .
bariilo purchased hundreds of homes and ranches ... ... in the northern part of culiacan .
and then he has turned around and given these homes to the people .
he' s a folk hero to them .
he' s also a mass murderer ... ... and a drug kingpin .
he' s trying to make himself a martyr by drawing the people to his side ... ... but the people can see through that .
men iike bariilo have stolen this country' s soul .
but my people wiii stand up for what is right .
i' m afraid they' re no ionger your people , sir .
then i wiii die fighting .
are you with me ?
to the death .
what' s wrong ?
everything .
this way !
come on , come on , come on , come on !
any suggestions , miss " let' s get a room on the fifth floor ... ... so we can see the beautifui sunset " ?
jump .
swing , swing , swing .
hang on !
what do you mean , hold on ?
let go now !
give me that !
stop the bus .
stop the bus .
a vow must be broken .
forgive me ... for what i am about to become .
when was your iast confession ?
an hour ago .
and the name of your priest ?
sands .
okay .
you are expected to carry out your assignment to the ietter
yeah , i know .
failure to appear ... ... in iocations at assigned times ... ... results in forfeit of protection , protection you wiii definitely need .
yeah .
you' ii be paid .
coup d' tats , iike elections , don' t come cheap .
so there' s plenty of dough floating around .
there' s more .
you wiii be a free man ... ... from marquez , the cartels , and even from the president ... ... who isn' t your biggest fan , iet' s face it .
when do i begin ?
give me a moment .
it' s a church , hombre .
i' m sorry .
are you stiii standing ?
stiil .
good .
well , the barillo cartel aren' t the nicest of guys , are they ?
however , you' ve passed the test .
you' re gonna do just fine .
assemble your team , and i wiii caii you with further instructions .
over and out .
i' m just walking my beat , friend .
mexico' s my beat , i' m walking it .
i throw shapes , and they catch them .
i set them up and watch them fail .
have him meet me at the builfight at 5 p . m .
what ?
why would i want that ?
why would i want bubble gum ?
aii right .
yeah , yeah , yeah .
okay , this should hold the both of us over for quite a iong time .
so i don' t ever want to see you again .
fuck off .
hi .
heilo .
the cla sharing a meai with the fbl .
now , if that isn' t interagency cooperation , i just don' t know what is .
i' m retired fbl .
a reai agent never retires .
he just takes it a iittle easier .
why are we talking ?
you tracked down armando bariilo ... ... for two years when he was running operations out of san antonio .
spinning wheels .
it never ied to an arrest .
weil , he
he is , in fact , sitting directly behind you .
i know .
he settled back in .
he' s been iiving here for six years .
can' t be touched .
did you know that most agents never even see a top 1 0 criminal ... ... for their entire careers ?
you brought down two , didn' t you ?
and now your third is sitting in very close proximity .
now , retired or not ... ... that has reaily got to tug on the old short and curlies .
i' m a civilian now .
didn' t he kiii that agent friend of yours ?
what was his name ... ... archuleta ?
yes .
bariilo is a mexican citizen .
he cannot be extradited for crimes committed in the u. s.
do you happen to know of a dr. guevera ?
worked for the cartel .
this doctor pumped your friend archuleta fuii of drugs , day after day ... ... so that they could torture him for two weeks before he died .
you must have known that .
dr. guevera himself having dinner with your prey .
i wonder what it is they' re up to now .
two weeks of torture , jorge .
think about that .
for your dead friend ... ... for the job you didn' t finish in san antonio .
now , are you reaily going to iet it slip away again ?
i' d iike you to have a bite of my pork because it' s ... ... the world .
it' s mariachi happy hour !
get your mariachi song for 5 pesos .
a mariachi kiss for 20 pesos .
and a mariachi fuck for only 50 pesos !
where the heii have you been ?
far away .
stiii fucking around ?
let me get fideo .
i' m here for my guitar .
it' s his iast night .
they' re firing him .
hey ... ... fideo , it' s me .
stiii drinking .
like a fish .
i guess we haven' t changed so much .
i didn' t think you' d ever come back for this thing .
neither did i.
are we on ?
i' ii iet you know .
i' ii iet you know .
bring him sober .
we' re gonna need him , so ... ... coffee .
lots of coffee .
sometimes a revolution is exactly what' s needed to clean up the system .
one ... ... giant enema , which just so happens to be my area of expertise .
builfights .
buii hockey .
do you iike this ?
the buii is stabbed , prodded , beaten .
the buii is wounded .
the buii is tired before the matador ... ... ever steps into the ring .
now , is that victory ?
of course it is .
wanna know the secret to winning ?
creative sportsmanship .
in other words ...
... one has to rig the game .
go coilect .
el presidente is giving a speech on the day of the dead ... ... in the town of culiacan .
he' s going to be isolated ... ... in the main edificio in the center of the plaza .
very easy access to him if ... ... somebody can get you in .
right .
you' re the man who can do that .
i am not the prince .
i am the man behind the prince .
i see .
he' s not the first prince i' ve served ... ... nor the first one that i' ve betrayed .
you' re a good rat .
i iike you .
i try .
the rest upon completion .
mucho gusto .
right .
right .
every goddamn time .
what do you want in iife ?
belini ... ... how iong have you and i done business together ?
a iong time .
and in a way ... ... i kind of , almost , could have the tiniest smidgen of respect for you .
almost .
but you need to stop farting around .
now , do you have the information that i need on bariilo or do you not ?
i have what you need .
i' m just enjoying this temporary position of power .
that make you nervous ?
you know that withholding vitai information from a federai officer ... ... is a serious offense .
especiaily when that officer has paid handsomely for it ... ... and wouldn' t think twice about ripping that patch off your eyehole ... ... and skuil fucking you to death .
no .
i' m fine .
go away .
i am fine .
go away .
you' re off the hook .
leave me alone .
that spiii just cost you your iife .
a iittle help .
okay .
i know it' s on you somewhere .
somewhere .
aii right .
time to get messy .
weil , i suppose i should thank you for not sticking it up your ass .
however .
you' re about a quart iow .
you' re gonna pay for that , cop .
why doesn' t my key work anymore ?
it' s too smail .
stand back .
i just i brought you a gift .
i' m stiii mad at you .
and trust me , it wasn' t easy to get .
so ....
come closer and i' ii thank you .
are you trying to give me a boner ?
closer , i said .
how about that iittle tip off ?
guarantees you a big arrest and an accommodation .
even from your twisted iittle agency .
i' m impressed .
but then what ?
want to hear my plan ?
either that or i start target practice .
okay .
the new president is on a quest to clear out the bariilo cartel .
and bariilo has set up a counterattack ... ... by hiring a military generai named marquez .
he wants him to throw a coup d' tat ... ... while the president' s visiting culiacan .
now , i have a man inside as insurance ... ... to make sure that marquez never takes power .
the iast piece of the puzzle ... ... is bariilo .
your tip off assures ... ... that barillo is out of the picture while the battle ensues .
in the aftermath of this very healthy revolution ... ... i will calmly waltz away with the 20 million pesos ... ... that barillo is prepared to pay marquez for the coup .
you want me to go with you ?
you detain bariilo ... ... with the information that you have , then you join me ... ... and share the spoils .
you meet me two nights from now ... ... at la pileta , 1 0 p . m . sharp ... ... and bring only what' s important to you .
oh , yeah .
it might get a wee bit dangerous there , sugar butt .
so ....
can you dig it ?
i can dig it .
i want my key back .
testing .
one , two .
testing .
heilo ?
can you hear me now ?
okay fucking beils .
did you assemble your team ?
you know i did .
why are you having me foilowed ?
oh , yeah , that .
let' s just call that a ... ... guarantee of compliance , shaii we ?
because cucuy also ...
... provides protection .
from what ?
mosquitoes ?
oh , gosh , i really wouldn' t mess with him if i were you ... ... because he' s a bit of a iive wire .
and he' s not the happiest that you killed his man .
oh , yeah , by the way , i have your next assignment .
you the mariachis ?
this is the back entrance .
make a note of it .
hey , hey , hey , hey .
who are they ?
musicians .
why so heavy ?
built in amplifier .
play something .
aii right .
let' s go .
i was afraid you couldn' t play .
are you kidding ?
what we are iooking for is support from the people of this state .
a man can do a iot alone , but he can do better with his people backing him .
i wonder how much we' re getting paid for this shit .
a man who wants nothing is invincible , cabrn .
hey .
are you gonna teii him that this is his iast meal ?
is there a particular song you would iike to hear ?
we just played for el presidente , i can' t buy half a tequila with this shit !
it was meant as an honor .
fuck honor .
we need money .
the score' s tomorrow .
enough for ail .
even for you , lorenzo .
why are you suddenly interested in the score ?
what' s in it for you ?
only revenge .
much delayed revenge .
go practice .
practice ?
playing or shooting ?
what do you think ?
i don' t think .
i drink .
yeah , heilo .
been foilowing bariilo ...
... and the good dr. guevera .
oh , agent ramirez , no ionger retired .
good man .
welcome to the fold .
i haven' t seen iilegai activities yet .
only that dr. guevera is scheduled for a medicai procedure ... ... on november 2 .
the day of the dead .
that' s tomorrow .
also identified a member of the group as biily chambers .
a fugitive .
we' ve been wanting to pick him up for some time now .
biily chambers ?
yeah .
you sure ?
bet my badge on it .
well ... ... whatever they' re up to , i can guarantee you ... ... that it' s going to happen tomorrow .
so i suggest you  what' s going down tomorrow ?
if you see an opening , take it .
what do you know ?
not enough .
get inside .
i' ve got nothing .
i gotta get in .
i got nothing .
try to make a move .
i don' t have a move to make .
what are you gonna do , stupid ?
biily chambers is on the move .
where are you going ?
you' re buying a taco .
this is too easy .
where are the other guys ?
this is a setup .
it smeils iike a setup .
i' m making my move .
biily chambers .
weil , that depends who' s asking .
i thought that was you .
here , iet me pay for this .
oh , weil , thanks .
oh , goddamn it .
is that real ?
yes , it is .
goddamn .
what took you boys so iong ?
whoa , hey , friend .
you ain' t gonna need that .
believe it or not , man , i' m ready to go .
let' s talk over there .
after you .
man , i just wanna get out of here .
i' ve been on the run , hiding out here down in mexico ... ... for the iast eight goddamn years .
and i' ve been working for this here cartei for the iast four .
i ain' t got shit .
aii i got is what i' m wearing on my back .
i can' t go nowhere .
sort of got me by the bails , you know ?
jorge ramirez .
i' ii take you in under the fbl' s supervision and protection ... ... untii we can take you back , where you wiii be prosecuted for your crimes .
in the u. s. ?
in the u. s.
the things that i' ve had to do for the goddamn cartei are ...
... unspeakable .
you don' t know what bariilo' s up to ?
i' m close to the man .
i' m reai close .
but he don' t iet nobody in , that cocksucker .
can you get him close to bariilo ?
him ?
i need your help .
then you get me out of here .
then i' ii get you out of here .
him too .
him too .
there' s cartei on every corner .
sands told me you handle protection .
i don' t work for sands anymore .
and since i' m a mexican , i can do whatever i want .
then i guess i don' t work for sands neither .
goodbye .
there' s a price on your head .
i' m going to coilect .
why don' t you just teii bariilo everything you know .
and then maybe he' ii just cut off your hands .
and if i don' t ?
you know that old man i kiiled in your viilage ?
what if your whole viilage was next ?
would you kiii them ?
me ?
they certainly would .
then i guess i have no choice ... ... but to kiii you ail .
you ... ... are iast .
that should put him out for a few days ... ... and give him some nasty dreams .
you have to relax your fingers .
music is pure , from one' s soul .
if the soui is pure , the music flows free .
and if the soui isn' t pure ?
then you must practice iike a motherfucker .
i present to you ... ... seor cucuy .
get this condescending ass out of here .
you want me to break his fingers ?
no .
i want you to chop them off .
i was just making a joke .
i wasn' t .
sit , please .
so ... ... you are the man who brought us ... ... the mariachi .
the man i work for , mr. sands ... ... he is using the mariachi to kiii gen. marquez .
so you want to join us ... ... here' s how it works .
there is the bait .
there is the trade .
a favor for a favor .
so ei mariachi is the trade ?
you are .
this ain' t my iine of work .
this guy' s aii fucked up .
generai marquez is arriving !
bring out the mariachi !
bring him out to the general !
i didn' t kiii you before .
enough blood had been shed .
but i see now ... that blood wiii spiii again .
generai marquez , the mariachi is not here .
he escaped .
you too wiii escape .
hey , hey , hey , hey , lore
why ?
practice shooting , not drinking .
we are on .
by order of the president , they are searching aii vehicles for guns and drugs .
that fucker' s been blockading aii the roads .
take us back another way .
by order of the president .
who does this guy think he is ?
he wants to get rid of me ?
fine .
i' il get rid of him .
replace him , even .
then i will simply disappear .
hey , vmonos , man .
don' t put me out completely .
have my men wait outside .
bariilo and dr. guevera must already be inside the building ... ... having entered through the back or basement .
they should be midprocedure .
federai agents .
this is going down now .
if bariilo wanted to iook unrecognizable to authorities ... ... he succeeded .
massive tissue ioss due to an only partiaily completed ... ... faciai reconstruction wasn' t necessarily the cause of death .
they switched bodies .
bariilo !
fbl .
he was anyway .
bring him along .
listen , i cannot do everything by myself .
i need someone to go in there with me .
no .
i iost my inside man .
probably dead .
and cucuy , greedy turd that he is , ratted me out and has disappeared .
plus , i' m pretty sure the cartei is shadowing me .
now , iisten , i have got a sweii bunch of guys intercepting marquez' s army ... ... but they' ve got no guns .
i want you to understand me .
this is no time to screw the pooch ... ... because this is supposed to be the big dance number , aii right ?
heilo ?
heilo ?
are you there ?
okay , okay , i' m going to freak right out .
i would iike the puerco pibil and a tequila with iime .
yeah , iisten , i need a new iine .
this one' s been compromised .
okay ?
thank you .
i' ii be waiting here at the la vaca volando .
that' s right .
the flying cow .
you reaily didn' t see it coming , did you ?
sorry , baby , i told you i wasn' t interested in your scheme .
too smail .
oh , my christ .
is that bariilo ?
that' s the new bariilo .
the old bariilo died in surgery a few hours ago .
what kind of cartei would have you running its operation ?
i' m his daughter .
you' ve been spying on my operation for some time .
i feei it' s only fair to warn you that kiiling me is crossing the iine ... ... and you wiii have every marine from here to guantnamo bay ... ... up your keister , mister .
so just know that .
fortunately for you , nothing you did is worth dying over .
you have only seen too much .
we are going to make sure that doesn' t happen again .

that sounded a iittle extreme for a parade .
troops are coming up from the south .
whose ?
emiliano marquez .
weil , what do we do ?

it' s much easier to defend this place than to chance going out in the open .

do you see someone ?
yes , he' s getting close .
listen , have you ever seen one of these ?
have you used one ?
don' t ever , because they' re bad .
but what i need for you to do is to aim this ... ... at the bad man who' s foilowing us and shoot him in the head .

now i realize ... ... start at the top .
the president is a good man .
i' ii go around back .

we could torture him .
he' s fbl .
he' s retired .
that doesn' t count .
i was tortured once .
i didn' t iike it .
