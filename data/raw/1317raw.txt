forget it .
it' s too risky .
i' m through doing that shit .
you always say that .
the same thing every time .
i' m through , never again , too dangerous .
i know that' s what i always say .
i' m always right too .
you forget about it in a day or two .
the days of me forgetting are over .
the days of me remembering have just begun .
you know , when you go on like this , what you sound like ?
i sound like a sensible fuckin ' man .
you sound like a duck .
quack , quack , quack .
take heart , ' cause you' re never gonna have to hear it again .
since i' m never gonna do it again , you' re never gonna have to hear me quack .
after tonight ?
correct .
i got all tonight to quack .
can i get anyone more coffee ?
oh , yes !
thank you .
you' re welcome .
i mean , the way it is now , you' re takin ' the same risk as when you rob a bank .
takin ' more of a risk .
banks are easier .
federal banks ain' t supposed to stop you in any way during a robbery .
they' re insured .
why should they give a fuck ?
i don' t even need a gun in a federal bank .
heard about this one bloke , he walks into a bank with a portable phone .
he gives the phone to a teller .
the bloke on the other end says ,
we got this guy' s little girl .
if you don' t give him all your money , we' re gonna kill her .
did it work ?
fuckin ' right it worked .
that' s what i' m talkin ' about .
knucklehead walks into a bank with a telephone .
not a pistol , not a shotgun , a fuckin ' phone .
cleans the place out .
they don t lift a fuckin ' finger .
did they hurt the little girl ?
there probably never was a little girl .
the point of the story isn' t a little girl .
the point of the story is they robbed a bank with a telephone .
you want to rob banks ?
i' m not saying i wanna rob banks .
i' m illustrating if we did , it' d be easier than what we' ve been doing .
no more liquor stores ?
what' ve we been talkin ' about ?
yeah , no more liquor stores .
besides , it ain' t the giggle it used to be .
there' s too many foreigners own liquor stores .
vietnamese , koreans , don' t even speak fuckin ' english .
you tell ' em empty out the register , they don t know what you' re talkin ' about .
they make it too personal .
we keep on , one of these gook fuckers gonna make us kill him .
i' m not gonna kill anybody .
i don' t want to either .
but they' il probably put us in a situation where it' s us or them .
and if it' s not the gooks , it' s these old fuckin ' jews who' ve owned the store for 15 fucking generations .
you got grandpa irving sitting behind the counter with a fucking magnum in his hand .
try walkin ' into one of those places with nothing but a phone .
see how far that gets you .
forget it .
we' re out of it .
well , what then , day jobs ?
not in this life .
what then ?
garon , coffee !
this place .
garon means boy .
this place ?
a coffee shop ?
what' s wrong with that ?
nobody ever robs restaurants .
why not ?
bars , liquor stores , gas stations ; you get your head blown off stickin ' up one of them .
restaurants , on the other hand , you catch with their pants down .
they' re not expectin ' to get robbed .
not as expectin ' anyway .
i bet you could cut down on the hero factor in a place like this .
correct .
same as banks , these places are insured .
manager .
he don' t give a fuck .
they' re just trying to get you out before you start pluggin ' the diners .
waitresses .
fuckin ' forget it .
no way they' re takin ' a bullet for the register .
busboys .
some wetback gettin ' paid $1 . 50 an hour ... really give a fuck you' re stealin ' from the owner ?
customers sittin ' there with food in their mouths , they don t know what' s goin ' on .
one minute , they' re havin ' a denver omelette , the next , someone is stickin ' a gun in their face .
see , i got the idea the last liquor store we stuck up , remember ?
all the customers kept comin ' in .
yeah .
you got the idea of takin ' their wallets .
now , that was a good idea .
thank you .
made more from the wallets than we did from the register .
yes , we did .
a lot of people come to restaurants .
a lot of wallets .
pretty smart , huh ?
pretty smart .
i' m ready .
let' s do it .
right now , right here .
come on .
all right .
same as last time , remember ?
you' re crowd control .
i' il handle the employees .
i love you , pumpkin .
i love you , honey bunny .
everybody be cool !
this is a robbery !
any of you fucking pricks move , and i' il execute every motherfuckin ' last one of you .

okay , so tell me again about the hash bars .
okay , what you want to know ?
hash is legal there , right ?
it' s legal , but it ain' t 100% legal .
you just can' t walk into a restaurant , roll a joint and start puffin ' away .
i mean , they want you to smoke in your home or certain designated places .
those are hash bars ?
yeah .
it breaks down like this .
it' s legal to buy it .
it' s legal to own it .
and if you' re the proprietor of a hash bar , it' s legal to sell it .
it' s illegal to carry it , but but that doesn t matter , ' cause get a load of this .
if you get stopped by a cop in amsterdam , it' s illegal for them to search you .
i mean , that' s a right the cops in amsterdam don t have .
oh , man !
i' m goin ' .
that' s all there is to it .
i' m fuckin ' goin ' .
i know , baby .
you' d dig it the most .
but you know what the funniest thing about europe is ?
what ?
it' s the little differences .
i mean , they got the same shit over there that they got here ,
but it s just there , it' s a little different .
example .
you can walk into a movie theatre in amsterdam and buy a beer .
and i don t mean just like no paper cup .
i' m talkin ' about a glass of beer .
and in paris , you can buy a beer in mcdonald' s .
you know what they call ... a quarter pounder with cheese in paris ?
they don' t call it a quarter pounder with cheese ?
they got the metric system .
they wouldn t know what the fuck a quarter pounder is .
what do they call it ?
they call it a royale with cheese .
royale with cheese .
that' s right .
what do they call a big mac ?
big mac' s a big mac , but they call it le big mac .
le big mac .
what do they call a whopper ?
i don t know .
i didn' t go into burger king .
you know what they put on french fries in holland instead of ketchup ?
what ?
mayonnaise .
goddamn !
i seen ' em do it , man .
they fuckin ' drown ' em in that shit .
yuck .
we should have shotguns for this kind of deal .
how many up there ?
three or four .
that' s countin ' our guy ?
not sure .
so that means that it could be up to five guys up there ?
it' s possible .
we should have fuckin ' shotguns .
what' s her name ?
mia .
mia .
how did marsellus and her meet ?
i don t know .
however people meet people .
she used to be a actress .
oh , really ?
she do anything i' d have seen ?
i think her biggest deal was she starred in a pilot .
pilot ?
what' s a pilot ?
well , you know the shows on tv ?
i don' t watch tv .
yeah , but you are aware that there is an invention called television ,
and on this invention they show shows , right ?
yeah .
the way they pick tv shows is they make one show .
that show' s called a pilot .
then they show that one show to the people who pick shows ... and on the strength of that one show , they decide if they wanna make more shows .
some get chosen and become television programmes .
some don' t , become nothin ' .
she starred in one of the ones that became nothing .
you remember antwan rockamora ?
half black , half samoan .
used to call him " tony rocky horror .
yeah , maybe .
fat , right ?
i wouldn' t go so far as to call the brother fat .
i mean , he got a weight problem .
what' s a nigger gonna do ?
he' s samoan .
i think i know who you mean .
what about him ?
marsellus fucked him up good .
word ' round the campfire is it was on account of marsellus wallace' s wife .
so what he d do ?
fuck her ?
no , no , no , no , no .
nothin ' that bad .
well , then what then ?
he gave her a foot massage .
a foot massage ?
that' s it ?
mm hmm .
then what' d marsellus do ?
sent a couple cats over to his place .
they took him out on his patio .
threw his ass over the balcony .
nigger fell four stories .
he had a little garden down at the bottom enclosed in glass , like a greenhouse .
nigger fell through that .
since then , he kind of developed a speech impediment .
that' s a damn shame .
hmm .
but still , you play with matches , you get burned .
what do you mean ?
you don t be givin ' marsellus wallace' s new bride a foot massage .
you don' t think he overreacted ?
antwan didn' t expect marsellus to react the way he did , but he had to expect a reaction .
it was a foot massage .
a foot massage is nothin ' .
i give my mother a foot massage .
it' s laying your hands in a familiar way on marsellus' s new wife .
i mean , is it as bad as eatin ' her pussy out ?
no , but it s the same fuckin ' ballpark .
whoa , stop right there .
eatin ' the bitch out ... and givin ' the bitch a foot massage ain' t even the same fucking thing .
it' s not .
it' s the same ballpark .
ain' t no fuckin ' ballpark neither .
now , look , maybe your method of massage differs from mine .
but touchin ' his wife' s feet and sticking your tongue in the holiest of holies ... ain' t the same fuckin ' ballpark ; it ain' t the same league ; it ain' t the same fuckin ' sport .
foot massages don t mean shit !
have you ever given a foot massage ?
don t be tellin ' me about foot massages .
i' m the foot fuckin ' master .
you given a lot of them ?
shit , yeah !
got my technique down and everything .
i don t be ticklin ' or nothin ' .
would you give a guy a foot massage ?
fuck you .
you give ' em a lot ?
fuck you .
you know , i' m kind of tired .
i could use a foot massage .
yo , yo , yo , man .
you best back off .
i' m gettin ' a little pissed here .
this is the door .
yeah , it is .
what time you got ?
7 : 22 in the a . m .
no , it ain' t quite time yet .
come on .
let' s hang back .
look , just cause i wouldn' t give no man a foot massage don t make it right ... for marsellus to throw antwan off a building into a glass motherfuckin ' house , fuckin ' up the way the nigger talks ; that shit ain' t right .
motherfucker do that shit to me , he better paralyse my ass , ' cause i kill the motherfucker .
i ain' t sayin ' it' s right , but you sayin ' a massage don t mean nothin ' .
i' m sayin ' it does .
now , look , i' ve given a million ladies a million foot massages , and they all meant somethin ' .
we act like they don' t , but they do .
that' s what' s so fuckin ' cool about them .
there' s a sensuous thing goin ' on ... where you don' t talk about it , but you know it and she knows it .
fuckin ' marsellus knew it .
and antwan should' ve fuckin ' better known better .
that' s his fuckin ' wife , man .
this ain' t a man with a sense of humour about this shit .
you know what i m sayin ' ?
it' s an interestin ' point .
come on .
let' s get into character .
what' s her name again ?
mia .
mia .
why you so interested in big man' s wife ?
he' s goin ' out of town , florida .
and he asked me if i' d take care of her while he' s gone .
take care of her ?
no , man .
just take her out .
show her a good time .
make sure she don' t get lonely .
you' re gonna be takin ' mia wallace out on a date ?
it is not a date .
it' s just like if you were gonna take your buddy' s wife to a movie or somethin ' .
it' s just good company , that' s all .
it' s not a date .
it' s definitely not a date .
hey , kids .
how you boys doin ' ?
hey , keep chillin ' .
you know who we are ?
we' re associates of your business partner , marsellus wallace .
you do remember your business partner , don' t you ?

but marsellus wallace don t like to be fucked by anybody except mrs wallace .
you read the bible , brett ?
yes !
well , there' s this passage i got memorized .
sort of fits this occasion .
ezekiel 25 : 17 .
the path of the righteous man ... is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish ... and the tyranny of evil men .
blessed is he who , in the name of charity and goodwill , shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness , for he is truly his brother' s keeper ... and the finder of lost children .
and i will strike down upon thee with great vengeance ... and furious anger ... those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers !
and you will know my name is the lord ... when i lay my vengeance upon thee !
## [ " let' s stay together " ]
i think you gonna find ... when all this shit is over and done
i think you' re gonna find yourself one smilin ' motherfucker .
the thing is , butch , right now ... you got ability .
but painful as it may be , ability ... don t last .
and your days are just about over .
now , that' s a hard motherfuckin ' fact of life .
but that' s a fact of life your ass is gonna have to get realistic about .
you see , this business is filled to the brim with unrealistic motherfuckers .
motherfuckers who thought their ass would age like wine .
if you mean it turns to vinegar ... it does .
if you mean it gets better with age ... it don' t .
besides , butch , how many fights you think you got in you anyway ?
hmm ?
two ?
boxers don t have an old timers ' day .
you came close , but you never made it .
and if you were gonna make it , you would have made it before now .
## [ music continues ]

the night of the fight , you may feel a slight sting .
that' s pride fuckin ' with you .

pride only hurts .

think nothin ' of it .
# lay me down in lonesome town #
# i can learn to forget ## so ...
marsellus said you just got back from amsterdam .
sure did .
how long were you there ?
just over three years .
i go there about once a year to chill out for a month .
no kiddin ' ?
i didn t know that .
why would you ?
## [ " ace of spades " ]
i heard you did a pilot .
that was my 15 minutes .
what was it ?
it was a show about a team of female secret agents called fox force five .
what ?
fox force five .
fox , as in were a bunch of foxy chicks .
force , as in we' re a force to be reckoned with .
and five , as in there' s one two three four five of us .
there was a blond one , sommerset o' neal .
she was the leader .
the japanese fox was a kung fu master .
the black girl was a demolition expert .
french fox' s speciality was sex .
what was your speciality ?
knives .
the character i played , raven mccoy , her background was she grew up raised by circus performers .
according to the show , she was the deadliest woman in the world with a knife .
and she knew a zillion old jokes .
her grandfather , an old vaudevillian , taught her .
and if we would have got picked up , they would' ve worked in a gimmick ... where every show i would' ve told another joke .
you know any of them old jokes ?
well , i only got the chance to say one ' cause we only did one show .
tell me .
it' s corny .
don t be that way .
tell me .
no , you wouldn t like it , and i' d be embarrassed .
you' d be embarr
you told 50 million people , and you can' t tell me ?
i promise i won t laugh .
that' s what i m afraid of , vince .
that' s not what i meant .
you know it .
now i' m definitely not gonna tell you ' cause it' s been built up too much .
what a gyp .
martin and lewis .
vanilla coke .
mmm .
yummy .
you think i could have a sip of that ?
be my guest .
i gotta know what a five dollar shake tastes like .
you can use my straw .
i don t have cooties .
yeah , but maybe i do .
cooties i can handle .
all right .
goddamn , that' s a pretty fuckin ' good milkshake !
told ya .
i don t know if it was worth $5 , but it s pretty fuckin ' good .
## [ music continues ]
don' t you hate that ?
hate what ?
uncomfortable silences .
why do we feel it' s necessary to yak about bullshit in order to be comfortable ?
i don t know .
that' s a good question .
that' s when you know you found somebody really special .
when you can just shut the fuck up for a minute and comfortably share silence .
well , i don' t think we' re quite there yet , but don' t feel bad .
we just met each other .
i' il tell you what .
i' m gonna go to the bathroom and powder my nose .
you sit here ... and think of something to say .
i' il do that .
okay .
i said goddamn !
goddamn !
goddamn .
i need some hair spray .
## [ " since i first met you " ]
mmmm .
don' t you just love it when you come back from the bathroom to find your food waiting for you ?
we' re lucky we got anything at all .
i don' t think buddy holly' s much of a waiter .
maybe we should' ve sat in marilyn monroe' s section .
which one ?
there' s two monroes .
no , there' s not .
that is marilyn monroe .
that is mamie van doren .
i don' t see jayne mansfield , so she must have the night off .
pretty smart .
yeah .
i got my moments .
so did you think of somethin ' to say ?
actually , i did .
however ... you seem like a really nice person , and l
i don' t want to offend you .
oooh .
this doesn' t sound like the usual , mindless , boring , gettin ' to know you chitchat .
this sounds like you actually have somethin ' to say .
well , well , i do .
i do .
but you have to promise not to be offended .
no , no .
you can t promise somethin ' like that .
i have no idea what you' re gonna ask me .
you can ask me what you' re gonna ask me , and my natural response could be to get offended .
then , through no fault of my own , i would have broken my promise .
let' s just forget it .
that' s an impossibility .
trying to forget anything as intriguing as this would be an exercise in futility .
is that a fact ?
and besides ,
isn' t it more , uh , exciting when you don t have permission ?
all right , all right .
well , here goes .
what did you think about what happened to antwan ?
who' s antwan ?
tony rocky horror .
you know him .
he fell out of a window .
hmm .
hmm .
well , that is one way to say it .
another way to say it would be that he was thrown out .
another way would be he was thrown out by marsellus .
yet even another way is to say he was thrown out of a window by marsellus because of you .
is that a fact ?
no .
no , it' s not a fact .
it' s just what i heard .
that' s just what i heard .
who told you ?
they .
they " talk a lot , don' t they ?
they certainly do .
they certainly do .
don t be shy , vincent .
what else did " they " say ?
i' m i' m not shy .
um  did it involve the " f " word ?
no , no , no , no , no .
they just said that antwan had given you a foot massage .
and ?
and and nothin ' .
that' s it .
you heard marsellus ... threw tony rocky horror out of a fourth story window for giving me a foot massage ?
mm hmm .
and you believe that ?
well , at the time i was told it sounded reasonable .
marsellus throwing tony out of a fourth story window ... for massaging my feet seemed reasonable ?
no , it seemed excessive , but that doesn t mean it didn t happen .
i understand that marsellus is very protective of you .
a husband being protective of his wife is one thing .
a husband almost killing another man for touching his wife' s feet is something else .
but did it happen ?
only thing antwan ever touched of mine was my hand when he shook it ... at my wedding .
really ?
truth is , nobody knows why marsellus threw tony out that window ... except marsellus and tony .
when you little scamps get together , you' re worse than a sewing circle .
ladies and gentlemen .
now the moment you' ve all been waiting for .
the world famous jackrabbit slim' s twist contest .
now , this is where one lucky couple ... will win this handsome trophy that marilyn here is holding .
now , who will be our first contestants ?
right here !
all right !
i wanna dance .
no , no , no , no , no .
no , no , no , no , no .
i do believe marsellus , my husband , your boss , told you to take me out and do whatever i wanted .
now i wanna dance ; i wanna win ; i want that trophy .
so dance good .
all right .
you asked for it .
let' s hear it for our first contestants .
now let' s meet our first contestants here this evening .
young lady , what is your name ?
mrs mia wallace .
and how ' bout your fella here ?
vincent vega .
all right , let' s see what you can do .
take it away !
go for it .
come on !

the day i bring an o. d. ing bitch to your house , then i give her the shot .
give it to me .
give me that .
all right , tell me what to do .
okay , you' re giving her an injection of adrenalin straight to her heart .
but she' s got a breastplate you gotta pierce through that .
you gotta bring the needle down in a stabbing motion .
i gotta i gotta stab her three times ?
no , just stab her once !
but it s gotta be hard enough to get through her breastplate into her heart .
once you do that , you p press down on the p plunger .
okay .
then what happens ?
kinda curious about that myself .
this ain t no fuckin ' joke !
am i gonna kill her ?
she' s supposed to come out of it like that .
it' s  all right , count to three .

that was fuckin ' trippy .
ohh .
oh , man .
mia .
mia .
what' s
what' s your thoughts on on on how to handle this ?
what' s yours ?
well , i' m of the opinion that if marsellus lived his whole life , he doesn t need to know nothing about this incident .
if marsellus knew about this incident ,
i' d be in as much trouble as you .
i seriously doubt that .
i can keep a secret if you can .
shake on it ?
mum' s the word ?
cool .
now , if you' il excuse me , i' m going to go home and have a heart attack .
vincent .
do you wanna hear my fox force five joke ?
sure .
except i think i' m still a little too petrified to laugh .
no , you won t laugh ' cause it' s not funny .
but if you still wanna hear it , i' il tell it .
i can' t wait .
okay .
three tomatoes are walkin ' down the street .
papa tomato , mama tomato and baby tomato .
baby tomato starts lagging behind , and papa tomato gets really angry .

he think totem pole alive !
he arctic tenderfoot !
that totem pole been here forever !
butch ?
one more thing , and we' il start for
butch , stop watching tv for a second .
yeah ?
you' ve got a special visitor .
stand up .
stand up .
now , do you remember when i told you your daddy died in a p. o. w. camp ?
well , this here is captain koons .
he was in the p. o. w. camp with daddy .
hello , little man .
boy , i sure heard a bunch about you .
see , i was a good friend of your dad' s .
we were in that hanoi pit of hell together ... over five years .
hopefully ... you' il never have to experience this yourself , but when two men are in a situation like me and your dad were ... for as long as we were , you take on certain responsibilities of the other .
if it' d been me who' d not made it ,
major coolidge' d be talking right now to my son jim .
but the way it turned out , i' m talking to you .
butch ...
i got something for ya .
this watch i go there ... was first purchased by your great grandfather during the first world war .
it was bought in a little general store in knoxville , tennessee .
made by the first company to ever make wristwatches .
up ' til then , people just carried pocket watches .
it was bought by private doughboy erine coolidge ... on the day he set sail for paris .
this was your great grandfather' s war watch , and he wore it every day he was in that war , and ... when he' d done his duty , he went home to your great grandmother , took the watch off , put it in an old coffee can , and in that can it stayed ... until your granddad , dane coolidge , was called upon by his country ... to go overseas and fight the germans once again .
this time they called it world war il .
your great grandfather gave this watch to your granddad for good luck .
unfortunately , dane' s luck wasn' t as good as his old man' s .
dane was a marine , and he was killed ... along with all the other marines at the battle of wake island .
your granddad was facing death .
he knew it .
none of those boys ever had any illusions about leaving that island alive , so three days before the japanese took the island , your granddad asked a gunner on an air force transport , name of winocki a man he' d never met before in his life to deliver to his infant son , who he' d never seen in the flesh , his gold watch .
three days later , your granddad was dead , but winocki kept his word .
after the war was over , he paid a visit to your grandmother , delivering to your infant father his dad' s gold watch .
this watch .
this watch was on your daddy' s wrist when he was shot down over hanoi .
he was captured , put in a vietnamese prison camp .
he knew if the gooks ever saw the watch , it' d be confiscated , taken away .
the way your dad looked at it , this watch was your birthright .
he' d be damned if any slope' s gonna put their greasy , yellow hands on his boy' s birthright , so he hid it in one place he knew he could hide something his ass .
five long years he wore this watch up his ass .
then he died of dysentery he give me the watch .
i hid this uncomfortable hunk of metal up my ass two years .
then ... after seven years , i was sent home to my family and ... now ...
little man , i give the watch to you .
it' s time , butch .
in the heavyweight division ,
in the right corner wearing the blue trunks , [ grunts ]
weighing 210 pounds ,
floyd ray wilson !
it' s official .
it' s official .
wilson is dead !
well , dan , that had to be the bloodiest , hands down , the most brutal fight this city' s ever seen .
coolidge was out of there faster than i' ve ever seen a victorious boxer leave the ring .
do you think he knew wilson was dead ?
my guess would be yes .
i could see the frenzy in his eyes give way to the realization of what he was doing .
i think any man would' ve left the ring that fast .
do you feel this tragedy ... is gonna affect the world of boxing ?
a tragedy like this can t help but shake the world of boxing to its very foundations .
it' s of paramount importance , during the sad weeks ahead , the eyes of the w. b. a. remain [ crowd cheering , yelling continues ]
man , you know i didn' t
marsellus .
no , it wasn' t .
i didn' t do it .
i didn' t do it .
how you doing ?
great .
i never thanked you for dinner .
what you got ?
he booked .
his trainer ?
says he don t know nothin ' .
i believe him .
i think butch surprised his ass same as us .
no , we don' t wanna " think .
we wanna know .
take him to the kennel , sic the dogs on his ass .
we' il find out for goddamn sure what he knows and what he don' t .
butch' s search how do you want it done ?
i' m prepared to scour the earth for that motherfucker .
if butch goes to indochina , i want a nigger hiding in a bowl of rice ... ready to pop a cap in his ass .
i will take care of it .
mister .
hey , mister .
what ?
you were in that fight , the fight on the radio .
you' re the fighter ?
whatever gave you that idea ?
no , come on .
you' re him .
i know you' re him .
tell me you' re him .
i' m him .
you killed the other boxing man .
he' s dead ?
the radio said he was dead .
sorry about that , floyd .
what does it feel like ?
what does what feel like ?
killing a man .
beating another man to death with your bare hands .
what are you , a weirdo ?
no .
it is a subject i have much interestin .
you are the first person i have ever met who has killed somebody .
so ?
what does it feel like to kill a man ?
i' il tell you what .
give me one of them cigarettes you got up there , and i' il tell you all about it .
so , esmeralda ...
villa lobos is that mexican ?
the name is spanish , but i am colombian .
that' s some handle you got there , honey .
thank you .
and what is your name ?
butch .
butch .
what does it mean ?
i' m an american , honey .
our names don t mean shit .
so , moving right along ,
esmeralda , what is it you want to know ?
i want to know what it feels like to kill a man .
i couldn' t tell ya .
didn t know he was dead ' til you told me he was dead .
now that i know he' s dead , you wanna know how i feel about it ?
i don' t feel the least bit bad about it .
what the fuck' d i tell ya ?
huh ?
as soon as the word got out the fix was in , man , the odds went through the roof .
i know .
i know .
unbelievable .
hey , fuck him , scotty .
if he was a better boxer , he' d still be alive .
if he never laced up his gloves , which he never shoulda done in the first fuckin ' place , he' d still be alive .
yeah , well , who gives a fuck ?
it' s over now .
yeah , well , enough about the poor , unfortunate mr floyd .
let' s talk about the rich and prosperous mr butch .
how many bookies did you lay it around on ?
all eight ?
how long to collect ?
so you' il have it all by tomorrow night ?
no , i understand .
a few stragglers aside .
oh , fuck , scotty , that is good news .
that is great news , man .
yeah .
mm hmm .
no , me and fabienne are gonna leave in the morning .
it' il probably take us a couple days to get down to knoxville .
okay , my brother .
you' re right .
you' re goddamn right .
all right , scotty , next time i see you , it' il be on tennessee time .
cool , brother .
$45 . 60 .
and , uh , here' s a little something for the effort .
now , if anybody asks you who your fare was tonight , what are you gonna say ?
the truth .
three well dressed , slightly toasted mexicans .
bonsoir , esmeralda villa lobos .
buenas noches , butch .
whew .
keep the light off .
is that better , sugar pop ?
oui .
hard day at the office ?
pretty hard .
got in a fight .
poor baby .
can you make spoons ?
you know what ?
i was thinkin ' about takin ' a shower .
i' m stinkin ' like a dog over here .
i like the way you stink .
let me take this jacket off .
i was looking at myself in the mirror .
uh huh .
i wish i had a pot .
you were looking at yourself in the mirror , and you wish you had some pot ?
a pot .
a potbelly .
potbellies are sexy .
well , you should be happy , [ grunts ]
' cause you have one .
shut up , fatso .
i don t have a pot .
i have a bit of a tummy , like madonna when she did " lucky star .
it' s not the same thing .
i didn t know there was such a difference between a potbelly and a tummy .
the difference is huge .
would you like it if i had a potbelly ?
no .
potbellies make a man look either oafish or like a gorilla .
but on a woman a potbelly' s very sexy .
the rest of you is normal normal face , normal legs , normal hips , normal ass but with a big , perfectly round potbelly .
if i had one , i' d wear a t shirt two sizes too small ... to accentuate it .
you think men would find that attractive ?
i don' t give a damn what men find attractive .
it' s unfortunate what we find pleasing to the touch and pleasing to the eye ... is seldom the same .
if you had a potbelly , i would punch you in it .
you' d punch me in the belly ?
right in the belly .
ohh !
i' d smother you !
i' d drop it right on your face ' til you couldn t breathe !
you' d do that ?
yeah .
promise ?
yeah .
mmm .
mmm .
oh .
did you get everything ?
yes , i did .
good job , sugar pop .
did everything go as planned ?
you didn t listen to the ow !
you didn t listen to the radio ?
i never listen to your fights .
were you the winner ?
i won , all right .
are you still retiring ?
sure am .
so it all worked out in the finish .
we' re not at the finish yet , baby .
we' re in a lot of danger , aren' t we ?
if they find us , they' il kill us , won' t they ?
but they won' t find us , will they ?
do you still want me to go with you ?
i don' t want to be a burden or a nuisance .
it' s
say it .
fabienne ,
i want you to be with me .
forever ?
forever and ever .
do you love me ?
very , very much .
butch .
yes ?
will you give me oral pleasure ?
will you kiss it ?
but you first .
okay .
okay .
butch .
mon amour .
l' aventure commence .
i think i cracked a rib .
giving me oral pleasure ?
no , retard , from the fight .
don' t call me " retard .
my name is fabby .
my name is fabienne !
stop it .
stop it !
my name is fabi
shut up , fuckhead !
i hate that mongoloid voice .
okay , okay .
sorry , sorry , sorry .
i take it back .
will you hand me a dry towel , miss beautiful tulip ?
oh , i like that .
i like being called a tulip .
tulip " is much better than " mongoloid .
i didn' t call you a mongoloid .
i called you a retard .
and i took it back .
butch ?
yes , lemon pie ?
where are we going to go ?
well , i' m not sure yet .
wherever you want .
