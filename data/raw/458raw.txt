your friend is late .
he' il be here .
oh , yeah ?
i do have other bidders .
i personally vouch for this man .
oh , well , i trust you , michael , but ... yousee , with each degree of separation ... comes a degree of uncertainty .
mr. turner .
mr. vas .
the kgb once tried to set me up ... so i had to kill three of their agents ... and then i hunted down their families .
the point is , if i sense anything out of the ordinary ...
no , the point is , i haven' t seen anything from youyet ... to justify a payment of $20 million .
so , before i hand over a small fortune ... and risk my life , i want to know 100 % ... that youcan , in fact , deliver the device .
that' s the point .
very well .
michelle ... owner' s manual .
this is your show of good faith ?
well , you' re still alive .
youconsider that a show of good faith .
what do youhave for me ?
down payment $ 1 million .
so , when do i get the device ?
let' s say ten days .
michael , youtake that telephone ... and i will call you and tell youhow to proceed .
youkeep it on youall the time .
as for you , sir , the next time we meet ...
i suggest yoube on time .
nice coat .
well done .
see youaround .
so far , so good ?
yeah , so far .
kevin' s got a tail .
ls it vas ?
they don' t look russian , but they don' t look friendly .
we' d better go back for him .
youordered us not to jeopardize our cover , sir .
hey , turn left .
turn left !
kill him !
ambush on the castle steps .
come on , faster . ...
let' s go !
get down !
get down !
there he is !
pull over !
you' re jeopardizing the mission .
youare the mission .
god , that was close .
did yousee who they were ?
kevin ?
doesn' t this all smack of extreme desperation ?
a nuclear bomb that fits neatly into a carry on suitcase ?
kevin spends two years getting close to these people ... in order to position you as the buyer .
vas won' t deal with anyone else ... and we have nine days to make this work .
i' d say desperation was the order of the day .
maybe vas set kevin up .
my guess is , it' s a rival buyer .
could be pakistanis , chechnyans , north koreans .
libyans .
try the entire middle east .
adrik vas is a businessman .
he' il take anyone' s money .
why kill kevin if they could just outbid him ?
we have deeper pockets .
he priced them out of the game .
who do youthink it is ?
well , the cold war is over .
these guys don' t wave flags anymore ... and fanaticism , terrorism is global .
whoever it is decided to eliminate the competition ... and force vas to deal with them .
so , the future of the so called free world ... may rest in this young man' s hands .

we' re not married , we can' t afford to get married .
and it doesn' t look like it' s ever gonna change .
youknow , poor people do get married .
i know , but i don' t feel like fighting with you ... every day because we' re broke .
marriage is hard enough without being poor .
hey , what happened to the love ?
what happened to all that romance ?
youknow i love you .
but youare living in this fantasy .
it' s like you' re waiting for some kind of miracle .
i gotta live in reality .

we just want to talk to you about something .
about what ?
about your brother .
yougot the wrong guy .
i don' t even have a brother .
that' s just a picture of me in a suit .
youcould' ve got that off the internet .
i saw a picture of bill gates with three titties on the net .
ok , september 8 , 1970 ...
bellevue hospital , new york city ... a woman registered as mary jeffries ... gives birth to identical twins ... but suffers complications and dies the next day .
what about the father ?
thomas b. jeffries .
presumed alive .
whereabouts unknown .
the state rarely separates twins ... but one of the infants jacob that' s you ... was diagnosed with severe lung infection .
youstill have the scar from the chest tube ... the incision mark .
an administrator at the hospital altered the birth record ... to give the healthy child a better chance at adoption .
a week later , roger and glenda pope ... took in kevin jeffries .
the popes never knew .
kevin never knew .
so , i have a twin brother .
big deal .
what' s the cla have to do with this ?
he couldn' t send me a letter ?
your brother' s dead .
how ?
a helicopter crash .
we need your help , mr. hayes .
your brother was working on something with us .
my twin brother was cla ?
yeah , a clandestine operative .
and just before he was killed , he set up a deal .
what kind of deal ?
a very important one .
so , we need youto stand in for him , just briefly .
pretend i' m him ?
yeah .
for how long ?
nine days .
nine days is not standin ' in .
standin ' in is an hour .
nine days is goin ' on tour .
ls this shit dangerous ?
there' s some risk .
what kind of risk ?
we talkin ' bad credit risk ... or a bullet in the ass risk ?
you' d be well compensated .
for a bullet in the ass risk ?
i hope that' s a lot of compensation .
how much ?
throw out a number .
a billion dollars .
you' ve overshot .
i don' t know what kind of budget you' re working with .
we were thinking somewhere in the region of ...
let' s say ... $25, 000 .
fifty .
yeah , fifty .
i figure youstarted with 25 , so i know yougot more .
youain' t gonna give me all your money .
50, 000 .
this is what i' m thinking , mr. hayes .
with $25, 000 , your girlfriend julie could go to college .
she wouldn' t have to go to seattle .
or work with ken .
ok , here' s what i' m thinkin ' .
you' re gonna give me $50, 000 tax free .
ok , 50, 000 after taxes after the job is done .
half now , half after .
ten now , forty after .
unless my mother had triplets ... you' re gonna give me ten now , ninety after .
ok , yougot a deal .
so , when do we start ?
now .
this is your brother' s file .
study it .
this is your brother' s file .
study it .
so there' s homework .
preparation .
ok .
let' s see , dad sits on the board of the new york stock exchange .
mom , co artistic director ... at lincoln center .
must' ve been nice .
in my foster house , we were so poor ... we used to lick stamps for dinner .
let' s see .
prep school at exeter .
then college at dartmouth .
served in the naval academy .
that' s right .
what' d he serve , lunch ?
oh , man .
rhoades scholar .
so my brother was real smart ?
yeah .
damn , the cla is cheap .
y' all could' ve got me a queen size .
what' s this , jack size ?
hey , what' s " zchod " mean ?
it' s czech for " bathroom .
you' il find the room labelled with phonetic translations .
why ?
because the deal goes down in the czech republic .
czech republic ?
here' s a dictionary .
how do i get an outside line ?
i need somebody to feed my cat .
youdon' t have an outside line or a cat .
so what am i supposed to be doing here ?
there' s a tape in the vcr .
it' s a video of your brother .
watch it .
the way he talks and the way he moves .
i know there' s a lot to deal with here ... but we' re all behind you .
we' il start in the morning .
yougot any questions ?
yeah , if my brother was such a genius ... then how come he' s dead ?
5 a. m. hey , i don' t do 5 a. m.
so , bottom line , what are our chances ?
i' d say anywhere between nil and zero .
why do yousay that ?
i grant you , he' s got potential .
he' s pretty street smart .
in 6 months , he could probably fool his brother' s parents .
but eight days ?
yougotta be kidding .
probably get himself killed on this mission ... and anyone else who goes along with him .
would youlike to be replaced on the mission ?
why ?
you' re going ahead with or without me ?
that' s precisely what i' m saying .
well , sir , when do i tell him what this mission involves ?
if i were you , i would tell him as little as possible .
don' t put anything into his head he can' t use ... and certainly nothing that could pop out at the wrong time .
ok .
what' s he doing now ?
he' s studying .
we told him to learn ... a few key phrases in czech .
he seems dedicated .
what' s he saying ?
he said , " i haven' t had my period in three months .
now what ?
where' s the hospital ?
i have a vaginal infection .
this is gonna be really interesting .
can' t wait to get started .
rise and shine , mr. hayes !
5 a. m. , and all is well .
how about three more hours of sleep and some breakfast ?
how about a nice shower ?
aah !
aah !
hey !
what' s wrong with you ? !
good morning .
today we' il be covering basic operations protocol ... for the acquisition of foreign assets ... a procedure we like to call " the three i' s " ... identifying the target , initiating the contact ... and infiltrating the network ...
now youdo it like him .
man , this is buggin ' me out .
i feel like michael jackson ...
lookin ' at old album covers .
look at this guy .
he looks like me , but it' s not me .
yeah .
so , what did he like to do ?
what kind of sports was he into ?
what kind of music did he listen to ?
he liked music .
jazz and classical .
classical , like run dmc ?
he didn' t like rap .
what 29 year old brother don' t like a little bit of rap ?
he didn' t listen to rap .
so , what kind of sports was he into ?
skiing .
ok , so yougot skiing , the navy , no rap .
we' d have had a lot in common .
sir .
hmm ?
what time ?
ok .
all right .
thanks .
so , what' s up with youand swanson ?
hmm ?
aw , come on , man .
i see there' s something goin ' on there .
yougot a little something goin ' on . ...
look at you .
you' re blushing .
do youmind if i say something to you , mr. hayes ?
my friends , officer seale , officer swanson ... they have faith in you .
i don' t .
and that creates a problem ... because you' re in so deep with us now ... we can never let yougo .
so you' d better learn this stuff ... stone cold by 0500 hours tomorrow morning .
or what ?
i' il kill you .
can we start a few hours later tomorrow ?
get dressed .
it' s 4 : 59 !
swirl .
checking for sediment .
sniff ...
and taste .
morning , mr. hayes .
5 a. m.
no , 5 : 01 .
pope .
kevin pope .
ha ha ha !
look at this suit .
man , i got initials on my cuffs .
the only thing i ever have on my cuffs is steak sauce .
they say " m. t.
what' s that for ?
michael turner .
but i thought i was kevin pope .
kevin pope is michael turner .
michael turner is kevin pope' s cover identity .
he is a very successful , very knowledgeable ... very sophisticated international dealer ... in fine antiquities .
well , if i' m jake hayes playing kevin pope ... playing michael turner , then i should get two checks .
cheers .
this is a very rare expensive cognac .
what do youthink ?
dry .
but never precocious .
i love your shirt .
egyptian broadcloth ?
three days .
pretty impressive .
yeah , he' s bright .
i think he can do it .
he' s got my vote .
i said he was bright .
i didn' t say he was capable of saving the world .
let' s run a real test .
like what ?
send him up to new york .
put him in kevin' s apartment .
let the neighbors , the doorman , everybody get a look at him .
see if they buy him as michael turner .
might even serve a double purpose .
whoever tried to kill kevin as michael turner ... probably doesn' t know he' s dead .
might still be looking for him .
so we dangle him as bait , keep him in the dark .
he' il be protected .
what do we tell him ?
you' re giving him a chance to practice being kevin .
that' s all youneed to tell him .
you' re the boss .
yousee the van in front of us ?
the one behind us ?
those are our guys .
here' s my cell phone number .
use it if youget into any kind of trouble .
what kind of trouble ?
any kind .
shark attack ?
call you .
all right .
could youpop the trunk ?
take this .
get yourself some shoes .
little punk .
mr. turner , welcome back , sir .
thanks , jim .
how was europe ?
like another country .
youcould put this on mtv cnribs .
man , this is dope !
god damn .
so if i paid taxes ... this is where the money would go , huh ?
could have a puffy party in here .
let' s get some music in here .

well , what are youdoing in the dark ?
some people are looking for me .
what did youdo ?
i didn' t do nothin ' !
it' s not what youthink .
it' s not the police .
it' s way too hard to explain .
look at this .
eight foster kids i' ve taken into my house over the years ... and all of them made something of themselves ... and not one of them had your potential !
oh , come on , ma !
sellin ' , scramblin ' and hustlin ' .
ma , did youknow i had a brother ?
stop talking crazy .
youhad lots of brothers .
how' s that nice girl i met last christmas ?
she left me .
hand me that umbrella so i can hit youagain .
youknow , ma , maybe it wasn' t my fault ?
youneed money ?
no .
yeah .
yeah .
yeah , i need money .
how much do youneed ?
i won $250 at bingo .
it' s just for a little while .
i' il pay youback .
i know .
want something to eat ?
youknow what ?
i really gotta go .
i' m never giving up on you , jakey .
you' re going to do something to make me very proud one day .
i know it .
i owe youan apology .
youhear me ?
i was just wondering how many of your people are listening in .
we' re alone .
no cameras , no wires .
just me .
yougot the floor .
your brother was assassinated .
by the same guys who came after me , right ?
i guess so .
doing the same job as you .
which is what ?
your brother , as michael turner ... was helping me buy something off the black market .
what ?
cuban cigars ?
playstation 3 ?
what ?
i can' t tell youif you' re not coming back in with us .
i' m not comin ' back in if youain' t telling me .
your brother died saving my life .
did youknow that ?
wish it had been otherwise , but that' s the way it is .
how are his parents taking it ?
youdidn' t tell his parents ?
no .
that' s the way we want it .
how would youfeel if youdied and nobody told your wife ?
i' m not married .
there' s no mrs. spy ?
not anymore .
relationships and attachments are useless in this business .
so that' s how this job is .
even if they don' t shoot you , they take your life . ...
i know it sounds hokey , but i honestly believe ... our lives are about something bigger than ourselves ... and i' m offering youa chance to commit yourself to something .
youain' t offering me nothin ' ... but a chance at a bullet in my ass .
i don' t see the higher meaning in that .
tell youwhat i' m gonna do .
thank you .
no problem .
i' il go and sit in the car and count to ten ... and if youwant to join me , fine , and if not ...
i' il tell the agency i couldn' t find you .
we can' t pull this job off without you .
we need you .
tch .
think about it .
oh , well .
that didn' t work , did it ?
no .
i' m gonna go outside and count to ten " ?
who the hell are you ?
you' d have done better with " bitch , get in the car .
ok .
get in the car ... bitch .
this is the man who tried to kill you .
we now know that he' s a member of a multi national ... terrorist organization led by this man .
meet the man who killed your brother ...
dragan adjanic .
he' s wanted by the hague for terrorist crimes ... against humanity , so he' s a fugitive ... everywhere in the world , including his own country .
he calls his movement " the black hand .
his members take a death pledge ... becoming suicide soldiers to further their cause .
last year , the fbi caught four of his men ... in a washington , d. c. motel ... with enough urea nitrate to level the capitol building .
he doesn' t like america and he doesn' t like you .
wait a minute .
what did i do ?
he' s your rival buyer .
for the item that this man has to sell .
now , this is adrik vas .
he' s a russian ex army colonel , kingpin in the russian mafia .
up to his neck in prostitution , drugs , and extortion .
sounds like anybody i went to high school with .
this is vas' s right hand man .
his name is michelle petrov ... otherwise known as " the hammer .
remember these faces ... because you' re going to be seeing them soon .
why do they call this guy the hammer ?
aah !
wha what ? !
good evening .
isn' t this fun ?
this is an exercise known as king' s game .
it' s meant to test your awareness .
what can youtell me about your attackers ?
they woke me up .
look , man , if youwant me to spy ...
i' m gonna need my rest .
how many were there ?
didn' t i just say they woke me up ? !
that' s the weird thing about an ambush .
next time we' il try and warn you .
do youunderstand what happened to youjust now ?
yeah .
i was jacked !
no , youpanicked .
when youthought youwere in danger , your brain shut down .
so what' s the point of having a good brain ... if youcan' t keep it operating ?
my brain didn' t shut down .
i knew it was swanson ...
' cause i could feel her tits on my back .
i knew it was carew ' cause his breath smelled like shit .

mnr .

i can' t wait to meet " the hammer .
oh , these guys must be " the toolbox .
should we move in , sir ?
no .
not until we' re sure they brought the bomb .
there' s too much at stake .
nice coat .
gentlemen , are we going to do business or aren' t we ?
depends , michael .
where have youbeen for the last nine days ?
i don' t believe that concerns you .
on the contrary .
it concerns me very much .
we make a deal , youdisappear .
doesn' t look good , my friend .
heads up , mccain .
be advised , targets are armed .

everyone maintain your position .
copy that , sir .
do we have a problem ?
i don' t know .
youtell me .
do we have a problem ?
do we ?
give me the cell phone i gave youearlier .
don' t worry .
i only made collect calls .
look , i don' t know what this is about , but ...
no , youdon' t , so shut up .
neither does mr. turner .
yousee , this cell phone has a global positioning system .
in a moment , it' il tell me exactly where you' ve been ... the last nine days .
fantastic , eh ?
well , haven' t youbeen busy ?
oh , youget around .
berlin , rome , zurich .
heh .
and not one decent treasure to show for it .
now , where' s the money ?
where' s the product ?
nearby .
so , how do we do this ?
i' m gonna call you on this cell phone ... then youhave one hour to get the money , michael .
then i' il call youagain and tell you ... where to bring it to .
youunderstand ?
i' m gonna have to run some tests ... so make sure youbring authentic merchandise .
fair enough .
i wouldn' t buy a car ... without checking under the hood .
ha !
are we agreed ?
yes .
no .
we' re not bringing money anywhere .
no ?
i' il have someone transfer the remaining 19 million ... when mr. turner tells us we have a viable device .
it' il be done by computer .
one of my men will be standing by at this address .
youwill send one of your brain trusts ... to verify the money is in your account , and that' s it .
give youa hostage ?
and youget one .
we' il call it a security deposit ... which neither of us will get back if we screw up ... or if we leave a mess .
it' s that simple .
now we have an agreement , i think .
agreed .
don' t yougo disappearing on me again , michael .
hey , youdid real well , mr. hayes .
hey , youdid real well , mr. hayes .
youknew they wouldn' t bring it , right ?
uh huh .
standard procedure .
guys like him won' t risk ... getting screwed on the first date .
what if youhadn' t changed the chip in the phone ?
it would have told him that the phone had already ... traveled to cla headquarters in langley ... and they would have shot both of us in the heads .
i' m hungry .
how about you ?
i' m gonna pass .
then good night .
oh !
michael !

so how come didn' t youtell me michael had a girlfriend ?
well , they broke up several weeks ago .
they had a fight , and she walked out .
well , it looks like she forgave him .
what the hell did he fight with her fine ass for ?

he was distant , some kind of psychotherapy crap .
anyway , she went off to cover the balkans .
