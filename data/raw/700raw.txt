coop , he' s already hit two .
it' s a fly ball to right , and deep !
that' s going to be way back !
and that' s going to be gone !
yea !
reggie jackson hits his third home run of the game !
yes !
whoo !
all right !
good catch , coop .
i can' t believe it .
i totally had it , but my glasses slipped .
remer , someday i' m gonna become a big sports star , too .
whatever you say , coop .
you just watch me , dude .
you just watch me .
there was a time in america ... when contests of athletic prowess ... were a metaphor for the nobility of man .
historic moments , forged by the love of the game , celebrated the human potential to achieve excellence .
but as time passed and the country neared the millennium , something went awry .
manning rolls right .
he' s got plough at the ten .
the five touchdown , dallas !
the ideal of sportsmanship ... began to take a back seat to excessive celebration .
the athletes caring less about executing the play ... than planning the vulgar grandstanding ... that inevitably followed even the most pedestrian of accomplishments .
the games themselves became subordinate ... to the quest for money .
stadiums and arenas ... became nothing more than giant billboards ... to promote commercial products .
players sold their services to the highest bidder , much like the hired guns of the old west .
thank you .
and after playing for new england ,
san diego , houston , st. louis , a year for the toronto argonauts , plus one season as a greeter at the desert lnn ,
i' m happy to finally play here in the fine city of miami .
minnesota .
whatever .
shit .
soon it was commonplace for entire teams to change cities ... in search of greater profits .
the minneapolis lakers moved to los angeles where there are no lakes .
the oilers moved to tennessee where there is no oil .
the jazz moved to salt lake city where they don' t allow music .
the oakland raiders moved to l. a. and then back to oakland .
no one in los angeles seemed to notice .
the search for greener pastures went on unabated .
continued expansion diluted the talent pool , forcing owners to recruit heavily ...
from prisons , mental institutions and texas .
fistfighting and brawling permeated every sport , overshadowing any athletic competition .
oh !
as the problems mounted , the fans became less and less interested .
to reverse the trend , major sports started interleague play .
when that novelty wore off , they tried intersports play .
but no matter how far major sports went , it wasn' t enough to bring the fans back .
the spirit of athletic competition , however , indeed was not dead .
its seed merely lay dormant in the dreams of the young .
you know , remer , someday i' m gonna be a big sports star .
you know , remer , someday i' m gonna own a big sports bar .
hurry it up , coop .
hold on .
i just gotta water the plants .
i don' t wanna go to a party with a bunch of losers from high school .
but this is britney kiser' s house , and i really want to fuck her .
dr. kiser .
dr. kiser .
coop and remer .

oh , hey , stef !

joe bryant , wlgm , at the scene where an unusual new driveway game ... has captured the imagination of at least one neighborhood .
an entire league has sprung up around this quirky ... round robins , starting with 12 teams in june , now down to just two , including , we' re told , the inventors of the game , childhood friends
it' s off the rim .
could be a double play .
maxwell tips .
newman' s try .
no !
shirts have a shot at the conversion .
remer !
keeps it alive .
last chance .
coop .
up !
good !
they make the conversion !
and the home run counts !
yeah !
yeah !
yeah !
yeah !
what a game !
the shirts win the world championship of baseketball !
yeah !
gentlemen .
gentlemen .
gentlemen , i' m ted denslow .
ted denslow , the billionaire ?
yes .
anyway , i like your little game here .
how' d you like to go pro ?
baseketball ?
national baseketball league .
we' re not interested .
now , wait a minute .
hear me out .
now , you kids with your loud music and your dan fogelberg , your zima , hula hoops , and pac man video games , don' t you see ?
people today have attention spans ... that can only be measured in nanoseconds .
i hear you .
just look at these people .
whoa !
way to go , coop .
they feel a certain connection with you as players .
with baseketball , we can start fresh , not allow teams to change cities ... or players to be traded .
and everybody will get paid the same , just like when i was a kid , and players were treated like
indentured servants ?
yes !
and the real beauty of this game ... is anyone can play .
any normal joe can be a sports hero .
haven' t you ever wanted to be a sports hero ?
sure .
once .
but that that was a long time ago .
well , if i know anything about this country ,
america will go nuts for baseketball .
america will go crazy for baseketball .
listen to that crowd .
listen to that crowd .
call an ambulance !
ooh , ooh , ooh
ooh , ooh , ooh i say she never cared
and that she never will
to do it all again
i guess i' il have to wait until then
lf i get drunk
well , the better i' il understand my baby
you won' t bother me no more
and if you' re drinkin ' well , you know that you' re my friend , and i' il say
i think i' il have myself a beer
ninth inning .
the beers still behind by three runs ... and now down to their last out .
and the pressure on these players has got to be enormous .
all right , you guys .
we' ve got one out left .
we' re not beat yet .
we can still win this thing .
can we do it ?
yeah !
yeah !
go , coop !
what a game these fans are seeing .
that gentleman , of course , beers owner ted denslow , the father of professional baseketball , along with his lovely new wife , yvette .
now shooting , number 44 , coop " airman " cooper !
coop !
coop !
coop !
coop is heading for the triple square .
bob costas , this has to be one of the most exciting baseketball games ... in recent memory .
just five years ago , this game was played only on driveways .
and it' s hard to believe just five years ago , those girls were only in grade school .
coop !
coop !
coop !
so , coop at the triple line .
jansen sets up for the psych out .
hey , coop .
be right with you , dirk .
it' s good !
nothing but net .
coop triples again .
he' s hit for the cycle seven times tonight .
he tricked me .
yeah !
go , coop !
yeah !
and listen to those foam heads doing the beers chug .
chug !
chug !
chug !
chug !
coop' s on third , with two down .
and that brings up squeak scolari .
i knew it was gonna come down to me .
relax , dude .
it' s not just you .
we' re a team .
and it all comes down to just one man .
oh , god !
listen to me , dude .
if i could have one guy out there , it' d be you .
unfortunately , that one man is squeak scolari .
ah , shit !
pretend this is just another game .
the denslow cup is , of course , the biggest game of the season .
ah , christ !
will you turn that shit off ?
i' m so scared .
listen to me !
you make that shot , or i' m gonna shove your head so far up your fucking ass ... you' il have to wear yourself as a hat !
and in the dugout , doug remer giving his teammate some last minute encouragement .
now , go out there and make that shot !
fuck !
the talented felon girls ... appearing in their third denslow cup game .
now shooting , number 23 ,
squeak " little bitch " scolari !
let' s go
so squeak scolari walks out to take the last remaining single .
come on , bitch !
nice one , bitch !
hey , squeak .
miss it .
miss it .
it' s good .
and the beers stay alive in the ninth .
dallas felons owner , baxter cain , hoping for another denslow cup victory .
now shooting , number 17 ,
doug " sir swish " remer !
two on , two out .
remer heads for the double line .
remer , you better make sure your toe' s not over the line .
hey , jansen , nice psych out , dingleberry .
yes !
it' s in .
it' s now a two run game .
dirk jansen apparently missing another psych out .
and everyone here at beers garden is on their feet .
coop !
coop !
coop !
and , al , at a time like this , you can' t help thinking about guys like john elway , guys who kept coming close and then finally got there .
ow !
if coop can make this one ,
the beers ' long wait will be over .
hey , coop , it looks like your boy denslow' s about to buy the farm .
aah !
ah !
oh !
he missed .
oh !
he missed .
i don' t believe it .
the felons win their second consecutive denslow cup ...
no , no . on the strength of a dirk jansen psych out .
aw !
i got you , dude .
i got you .
you  whoa , whoa , whoa .
relax .
relax .
do the happy dance .
we just lost the game .
do the happy dance .
where' s the singing ?
aw , i don' t wanna sing .
do the singing .
come on .
sing .
happy dance doin ' the happy dance
shit !
denslow !
and these beers fans have to be disappointed .
what an unfortunate thing to happen on dozen egg night .
oh !
oh !
oh !
oh !
it' s my husband .
somebody help him .
oh , god !
if there' s anything you need  oh , teddy .
i can' t believe it .
he just fell over .
oh !
mrs. denslow ?
mrs. denslow !
oh !
i wish there was something i could do .
uhh !
they stopped serving them after the seventh inning .
somebody get this man a hot dog !
you' re absolutely right , jim .
ted denslow was a hero because his vision brought baseketball ... from neighborhood driveways into big arenas , but more importantly , into the hearts and tvs of america .
it' s a very sad day .
yee ha !
his untimely death casts an unbearable pall over an otherwise sweet victory .
hey , yeah !
and all of our hearts ...
are with you and your family on this  go , dallas !
dirk jansen , winner of the winter' s warm douche m. v. p. trophy .
what' s your take on this stunning upset ?
the whole key to this game was when i psyched out coop .
no doubt about it .
and all you people watching
i can' t believe this guy .
he didn' t psych me out .
if anyone should get the psych out , it should be denslow .
dude , weak .
coop , i know this is a dark time for you , but i' d like to get your thoughts on what happened today .
well , tim , today i lost the big game and a dear friend .
um , i' m feeling pretty vulnerable right now .
i don' t think i should be alone .
i really need people to talk
it certainly does seem to be raining shit on joe cooper right now .
on paper , the beers had the far superior team .
with the outside shooting of coop and the deadly accuracy of doug remer , what happened out there ?
well , you know , it was a team effort , and i guess it took every player working together to lose this one .
thanks , doug .
and so
hey !
you wanna do an interview with me ?
no .
so another baseketball championship is in the books .
yet another opportunity lost for the beers .
man , i gotta go .
hey , coop .
coop !
what' s going on ?
coop !
coop !
hey , coop !
this is tim mccarver from beers garden ...
where the dallas felons have defeated the milwaukee beers ...
in denslow cup iv by a score of 13 to 11 .
everybody in .
one at a time .
aw , please .
can we ?
there he is !
where ?
oh , man !
cool !
can we talk to him ?
can we stay ?
please , miss reed .
excuse me .
excuse me .
hi .
would you mind signing a couple of autographs for the kids ?
i think you' re looking for the dallas locker room .
it' s over there .
i know , but it was so crowded .
i mean , um , they would really rather have your autograph .
really ?
anyway , would you mind signing these ?
uh , sure .
oh .
uh , it' s nice to meet you , miss ...
reed .
jenna reed .
joe cooper .
coop .
i know .
are all these kids with you ?
oh , yeah .
i' ve been the director of the dream come true foundation ... since october .
oh , the ones that grant wishes to sick and dying kids , right ?
well , we prefer to think of them as health challenged ... and survival impaired .
you' re a big fan of baseketball ?
no , not really .
i mean , the kids are big fans .
i try and keep them interested in things that are a little more permanent .
permanent ?
you know how professional athletes come and go .
not in baseketball .
there' s rules against it .
well , hello .
miss reed , this is remer .
would you like a fresh pretzel ?
i baked it myself .
oh .
thank you .
it goes great with mustard .
okay .
miss reed .
miss reed .
dude , you didn' t make that pretzel , did you ?
of course not , but chicks like guys who can cook .
what ?
see , it works .
she was checking out my ass .
she wasn' t checking out your ass .
all set then ?
i better get these kids back .
little travis is getting impatient .
hey , i love kids .
which one' s travis ?
here .
heads up , big guy .
uhh !
are you all right , travis ?
i think he' s sleeping .
he needs a little work on the hands .
he' s blind , doug .
ah !
felons fans rejoiced in their team' s denslow cup victory ... with a huge celebration in downtown dallas .
14 injured , three dead .
and on a sad note , the sports world was devastated tonight ... by the passing of ted denslow .
by all accounts , the late beers owner seemed to be the only one ... surprised by his death .
and it appears time just finally ran out ... for the old cocksucker .
theodore denslow , dead at 85 .
his hairpiece was 24 .
these chaps i wore in rootin ' tootin ' rhythm ...
these chaps i wore in rootin ' tootin ' rhythm ...
i bequeath to my nephew herman .
hope he looks as snappy in them as i did .
and this poncho that kept me dry during the filming of
mrs. denslow .
baxter cain .
may i sit down ?
of course .
my deepest sympathy on your great loss .
thank you , mr. cain .
my valuable hand painted plate commemorating the pope' s visit ... to dodger stadium ,
i leave to my niece susan .
aw !
limited edition , signed in the mold ,
with a photocopied certificate of authenticity .
jenna .
this six shooter i wore  what are you doing here ?
well , i' m not sure .
i i got this letter .
yeah , yeah , me , too .
and the toothbrush used to clean the oats ...
oh !
clumsy idiot !
where' s the body ?
they buried him two days ago .
this is the will reading .
oh .
well , in that case these are for you , jenna .
now as a special fluke of charity ,
i bequeath these season tickets to the dream come true foundation .
thank you .
i had nothing but respect for your late husband .
unfortunately , he was the one person who stood in the way ... of making any kind of changes in baseketball ... that might increase the owners ' profits .
i can' t imagine what he had against making money .
i trust that quality isn' t sexually transmitted .
that' s pretty sweet , huh ?
yeah .
the kids will be very excited .
especially little joey .
joey ?
well , he' s such a big fan of yours .
he' s going into the hospital next week , and he begged me to ask you if you' d come by for a visit .
but it' s not a good idea .
i' d love to come by .
hey , i' il come by .
i like hospitals .
no , you don' t .
you like taco bell .
i went to this hospital in france and got together with this chick .
dude , that was a hostel .
oh , yeah .
and finally , of course , my beloved beers ,
i bequeath controlling interest to ...
joseph r. cooper .
yes !
we own the team !
i gave him the best three months of my life .
sweet !
way to go , dude !
and , coop ?
yes , mr. denslow ?
i know you have it in you to lead the beers to victory this season ... because if you don' t , the team reverts to yvette .
what ?
don' t feel badly about losing the team .
i believe this is merely a temporary situation .
thank you , mr. cain .
it' s nice to have a strong , handsome man like you on my side .
well , yes .
i' d love to discuss this further with you .
why don' t you visit sometime ?
maybe we could , uh ...
iay some carpet , if you know what i mean .
at this time , i' d like to ask everyone to leave the room ... so i can have a private moment with coop .
now that we' re alone , coop , there' s something i wanna tell you .
remember when you had the crabs ...
and the only thing that made you feel better was this lotion ?
well , i found another use for it .
it feels so good , it makes me wanna sing .
just like that night we spent in the tattoo parlor in chicago .
come on , baby .
i' m too sexy for my shirt
too sexy for my shirt
so sexy it hurts
and i' m too sexy for my car
too sexy for my car too sexy by far
you gettin ' this ?
that' s two rooms done .
boy , those corners are tricky .
you' ve done a fine job , yvette .
now , as i was saying , i think i' ve come up with a plan ... to make sure that coop never wins that denslow cup .
oh .
so then the team will be mine ?
yes .
that' s wonderful , baxter .
do you want me to move on to the conference room ?
no .
not yet .
but you know , i think my lobby could use a good buffing , if you know what i mean .
mmm .
i know exactly what you mean .
oh !
oh , god !
oh !
oh , i can' t do this shit !
and the beers coming up to bat ... for the first time in this season opener against miami , a game they have dedicated to ted denslow , a team wearing black in memory of the late beers owner .
the beers cheerleaders also mourning the loss .
glamour is a rocky road
mmm !
mmm !
mmm !
skin flicks , lipstick baby scribbles in the mirror
drama overdosage
dude , it' s a whole different ball game now that you own the team .
yeah .
i was just thinking .
denslow was right .
this season could be different .
we just gotta kick some ass .
we' re playing to keep this team .
you up for it ?
dude , i' m in , all or nothin ' .
glamour is a rocky road

in order for those rules to change , every owner has to vote yes .
denslow was already filthy rich .
he didn' t need the changes .

well , before you make any hasty decisions , discuss it with your teammate .
i don' t have to .

for this brave little boy .
hey , pete , what' s the matter with coop tonight ?

coop in the home run circle , getting ready to take his shot .
it' s up .

coop sinks his second home run of the game .
his blood sugar' s way up since yesterday .
has there been any change in his fluid intake ?
sweet jesus !
his sodium' s level through the roof !

he' s eight years old , and he smells like robert downey , jr .

they went on some sort of rampage , and i was so worried about ...

yeah , i don' t doubt that .
oh !

you seem so happy .
yeah , l i guess we were .
we were just best friends playing ball in the driveway .
next thing i know , i' m on espn and wheaties boxes .
and i guess it' s all pretty sweet .
but nowadays , since denslow' s been gone ,
i' m in charge of the team , and the whole league now .
sometimes i forget why i play the game .
why do you play it , coop ?
mr. october .
the guy in the chippendales calendar ?
no , that was dwayne zackemore .
i mean ... whoever it was that month .
i' m talking about reggie jackson .
i saw him play in a world series once .
he hit three home runs in one game .
i caught the third one in the stands .
i remember growing up , it meant so much to me .
all i ever dreamed of was to be that guy , have that one shining moment .
be a hero .
you already are a hero , coop .
you' ve won these kids ' hearts , but
what ?
well , i' m just worried about getting attached
i mean , the kids getting attached .
i don' t want them to be hurt .
jenna , i would never do anything to hurt these kids .
but what joey really needs to know ... is where are you going to be next year .
right here .
and the next year , and the year after that .
right up until joey grows up ... and gets a driver' s license ... and ... starts going out with girls ... and meets the right one ... and forgets about baseketball altogether .
goes home , does some push ups , fucks the sleeve of his favorite jacket .
what ?
huh ?
i' m i' m just saying we' il be here for joey .

oh , that reminds me .
can you break a 20 ?
what , dollars ?
i didn' t think so .
let me get straight to the point , don .
may i call you don ?
yeah , i guess so .
don , when i see one of baseketball' s hottest stars ... with less than $20 in his pocket , driving an american car , sharing a small house with two other guys , you know what that says to me ?
homos ?
no , no , no .
it says you' re underappreciated .
and underpaid !
oh , yeah , i mean , i guess we are underpaid .
i want to change all that .
players of your caliber should be making the big bucks .
don' t you agree ?
remer !
remer !
try to stay with me on this , all right ?
all right .
now , last week , i tried to get coop to agree to certain rule changes ... that would make you millions .
me ?
millions ?
now listen carefully .
do you think shaq got rich playing in orlando ?
hardly .
he made his fortune moving to l. a.
you know how much he makes now ?
as much as he made playing in college ?
what ?
no !
lots more big money .
and you can too !
would i have to quit baseketball ?
what ?
no !
i need you to get coop to go along !
he' d have to quit baseketball too ?
did i just fart ?
uhh !
top of the seventh , and those cheers you' re hearing ... are from the nearly 15, 000 on hand here for anal probe night .
so , two outs , and doug remer heading for the triple square .
he' s 0 for 12 so far tonight .
in fact , with the exception of coop , the beers are ice cold .
oh , man , that doesn' t even qualify as an air ball !
and the beers are gone in the seventh .
the aliens now coming up with the top of their order .
which , if you' re scoring at home , is the same three guys who came up last inning .
all right , what the hell' s going on ?
you guys are lying down out there !
oh , i get it .
you guys are pissed off .
uh , why ?
dude , you turned down cain' s offer without talkin ' to us .
mm hmm !
yeah .
all right , what do you want , dude ?
dude , what do you think ?
we invented this game together , but you get to control everything .
listen , cain has some pretty good ideas  dude , denslow gave me the team .
i already told cain no .
dude , i' m sure denslow is happy in his little worm farm but
dude , i' m not gonna do it .
all right , dude , listen to me carefully .
do you think shaq got rich playing in orlando ?
no , he got rich playing in college .
everybody knows that .
dude , it' s not about the money .
it' s about tradition .
look , think about the greats who have played this game .
it' s because of them .
it' s because of us that i can' t bow down to a guy like cain .
that' s easy for you to say , ' cause you got the team !
we got jack shit !
even squeak is pissed off !
hell , i never really minded .
shut up , bitch !
dude , quit thinkin ' about yourself for a change !
dude , i' m not gonna cave in .

you' d be willing to do that for us ?
yeah , and that' s not all .

the woman stared hopefully ... into the ancient cowboy' s weathered face .

his disjointed voice seemed to be coming from afar .
the beers win their tenth consecutive game .

dude , what are you doing here ?
i jet here , i jet there .

uh , but i think i may have a solution to her problem .
there .
it' s a time tested moneymaker .
every athlete does it .
you want me to have bigger titties ?
what ?
no , no .
it' s a clothing line a beers clothing line .
no , dude , that' s against the baseketball bylaws .
not if the proceeds go to charity .
think about it .
miss reed' s foundation will never have to worry about funding again .
awesome , dude !
i think we should definitely do it !
' scuse us .
will you let me do the talking here ?
there' s no way i' m doing any kind of deal with this piece of shit .

we' il do a big media blitz .
and don' t worry about coop .
he' il come around .
i' m a scat man
hi there , i' m dan patrick .
and i' m kenny mayne .
with the first seven months of the baseketball post season out of the way , the play off picture is now starting to emerge .
so with last night' s victory over boston , next week the beers must beat lndianapolis ... to advance to charlotte that' s in an effort to reduce their magic number to three .
right , and the beers can advance to the national eastern division north to play tampa .
so , if the beers beat detroit and denver beats atlanta ... in the american southwestern division east northern , then milwaukee goes to the denslow cup , unless baltimore upsets buffalo and charlotte ties toronto .
then oakland would play l. a. and pittsburgh in a blind choice round robin .
if no clear winner emerges from all this , the two man sack race will be held ...
on consecutive sundays till a champion is crowned .
right .
dude !
dude !
dude !
after the grueling , regular baseketball season , we' re now in month nine of the play offs .
no , daddy , don' t touch me there !
the beers , vying with san francisco ... for a slot in the denslow cup game .
ninth inning , ferries up by one , coop steps in .

ladies and gentlemen , welcome to calcutta lnternational airport , where it is currently 95 degrees with a light drizzle .
we hope you enjoy your stay here in lovely calcutta .
taxi !
amoka , come on !
aw , c' mon !
driver , i' m in a hurry !
look , just take me to 7 1 1 aw !
here you are , beerswear factory .
hey , you , is this  i' m sorry , no entrance
who the hell are you ?
i factory manager .
who you ?
i joe cooper i mean , i' m joe cooper .
wait , mr. cooper , you must put on hard hat !
aw , this is awful .
aw , this isn' t good !
do any authorities know about this ?
aw !
aw !
wait , wait , please , mr. cooper !
put that down !
a young man .
his whole life in front of him disappears .
a familiar story , yes .
but this is no ordinary joe .
joseph r. cooper , perhaps the most loved sports figure in the country vanished .
according to mrs. elsie melcher , a neighbor who asked not to be identified ,
joe cooper left his house two weeks ago .
according to angelique bones , a nosy bitch who lives up the street , he took with him only a toothbrush , a wallet , a steamer trunk and a plane ticket to calcutta .
police theorize several possible scenarios of what happened ... to the man affectionately known to the world as " coop .
i don' t know where the hell he is .
for all i care , he could be hanging by his neck in his fuckin ' closet .
he' s hanging by his neck in his fucking closet .
the night before his disappearance , coop' s girlfriend had paid him a visit .
according to friends , they had quarreled .
if you' re looking for joe cooper , i suggest you look wherever you find ... the most heinous , blatant and vile exploitation of children on the planet .
coop went to disney world .
here' s a photograph of joe cooper taken just days before his disappearance .
here' s a computer enhanced simulation of what he might look like today .
from milwaukee , wisconsin , on the shores of lake michigan , it' s the denslow cup , where the defending champion dallas felons ... meet their perennial challengers the milwaukee beers .
hello , i' m ai michaels along with bob costas inviting you ... to join us here at beers garden for denslow cup v.
and we' re in for a classic battle tonight .
you' re absolutely right about that , al .
we have over a hundred million people throughout the world tuned in to see this game .
many of them , of course , with no understanding of the sport itself , but nonetheless fascinated by the flickering images and the bright , pretty colors .
high up in the stands , pyrotechnic expert sergio " lucky " ferouch ... is readying another spectacular , halftime fireworks display .
all right , you guys .
you ready to kick some ass ?
what' s wrong , you guys ?
why the long faces ?
we miss coop .
can' t win without him .
we don' t need coop .
i' il lead you to victory !
we' re supposed to be a team .
without coop it' s not the same .
look , even if coop was to walk in here right now , it wouldn' t change the outcome of this game one iota .
we can win this thing !
are you with me ?
yeah , yeah !
that' s the spirit .
are you with me ?
yeah !
yeah !
all right , coop' s here !
we' re underway here for denslow cup v.
a stunned crowd of over 18, 000 witnessing the beers ... being thoroughly dominated by the felons .
come on , beers !
go , coop !
hey , guys , thought i told you we weren' t gonna watch this game .
oh , come on , miss reed .
it' s the denslow cup !
these are not the kind of people to be looked up to or emulated .
the severed and mutilated head was postmarked denver .
the owner still has not stepped forward .
the disappearance of the milwaukee beers baseketball star .
when joe cooper discovered that the workers in the beerswear factory were youngsters , not even old enough for prostitution , he personally flew to calcutta .
his new , all adult workforce now makes a decent wage , enjoys full medical benefits and in house child care .
all of us here are glad that such a terrific human being like joe cooper has returned .
if i were a woman , i' d sure like to be his girlfriend .
walking in the park , hand in hand , wrapping my legs around him , cuddling in the spoon position , our hearts beating in unison , staring into his eyes over our morning coffee
uh , yes , yes , thank you .
when we come back , our next unsolved mystery  come on , kids .
we' re going to the game !
yea !
ladies and gentlemen , for your seventh inning stretch entertainment ,
viva calypso !
we' re up 16 nothing at the break .
have the trucks pull up to the locker room .
we' il sort out the stuff when we get to jacksonville .
okay .
hey , baxter .
i finally got all the chrome off this for you .
nice .
very nice .
you want me to start on this one ?
ladies and gentlemen , please direct your attention now ... to the malaka laka balance board of trust , symbol of brotherhood in many polynesian countries .
assuming the roles of the downtrodden but happy natives , with their good luck pineapple , your milwaukee beers !
thanks for flying back , coop .
you really made a big difference in the score .
if i wouldn' t have been cleaning up your mess , i wouldn' t be jet lagged and shitting curry !
hey , guys , knock it off , all right ?
representing their white colonial oppressors , the dallas felons !
and now , let' s all join our caribbean brothers ... in the ceremonial south sea handshake above the lagoon of peace .
all right , let go !
you let go !
stop it .
stop it !
guys , come on , man !
money grubber !
powermonger !
cock !
guys , stop it !
whoa !
hey !
you son of a bitch !
you asshole !
die !
eat shit !
hey !
would you just stop it ?
would you hold on a minute ?
hey !
would you just stop it ?
would you hold on a minute ?
look at you guys , fighting on the malaka laka board !
you should be ashamed of yourselves !
back in the driveway , we were nothing !
now we' ve risen to the highest level , but you' re throwin ' it all away !
if you' ve forgotten what baseketball means to america , you have only to look at this board the malaka laka balance board of trust .
don' t you see what we have here ?
a game where guys with bad backs and bad knees ... can get together and compete on the same field ... as guys that are all goosed up on steroids .
but more than anything , isn' t this game about gettin ' together with your friends and havin ' a good time ?
i remember
i remember a long time ago , i didn' t have anybody .
you guys took me in .
i guess that' s why it kills me to see you like this .
if we can' t be friends , then the heart and soul are out of this game .
certainly out of me !
i know i' il never get that back again .
we have sullied the waters of the lagoon of peace !
i' m begging you , for the love of our caribbean brothers , dudes , stop this madness !
hang on !
oh , my god !
remember to hold your breath just before we hit !
never let go !
bob , this has to be the most spectacular extravaganza i have ever seen !
you can cram three seats into the space it takes for one wheelchair , not to mention the wasted space it takes for the oxygen bottle .
hell , those little shits never pay full price anyway !
baxter !
i just realized i can' t stand you !
you can kiss these puppies good bye !
oh .
shit , coop .
i' m sorry .
i guess the money did go to my head .
no , l i' m sorry , remer .
i think i' ve got a lot to learn about sharing .
look at me .
i' ve become everything i used to hate .
maybe we we just grew up too fast .
my worst enemy turned out to be me .
dude .
dude .
dude .
dude .
hey , puck , i' ve got two over
all right , let' s go win ourselves a championship !
yeah !
she was a little green
he was just a little mean
they were together all the time
so now no one can forget this thing that happens all the time
she would do anything
yo , darcy .
yeah ?
hey , that' s my wife !
yeah , and this is me !
they live together all the time
so now no one can forget this little thing
that' s on her mind
it' s a waste to wonder what' s a heart these days
it takes a lot to get up and just leave those who
hey , dirk !
what is it ?
i hear your sister' s goin ' out with squeak !
aaah !
and squeak scolari crosses the plate again ... as the beers have come roaring back since the break .
bob , this is more like the beers team we' ve seen all season .
ninth inning , two outs .
beers still down by two runs .
felons on first and third .
the beers have to stop dallas here if they want to stay in this game .
and the always dangerous grumsky coming up .
get this guy , coop .
he hasn' t missed a shot all night .
i know , but i don' t know what to say .
nothing works on him .
hey !
tell him he' s fat !
dude , that' s not cool .
yeah , it is .
that' s not cool .
no , no , no .
just do it really subtle .
subtle .
hey , grumsky , you losin ' weight ?
oh , big ass !
you' re fuckin ' fat .
you' re goddamn fuckin ' fat .
how' d you get so goddamn fuckin ' fat ?
the beers hold them in the ninth on a clutch psych out ... by " coop " cooper .
coop !
coop !
coop !
coop !
coop !
coop !
bottom of the ninth .
dallas , 16 .
milwaukee , 14 .
remer on second , scolari on third .
coop' s coming up .
and so , it all comes down to this one shot .
coop makes it , the beers win the cup , and get to keep the team .
or , he misses .
coop !
coop !
coop !
oh , my god .
la z boy has popped !
the ball coop has used every day of his career is gone , and a time out has been called as the beers star tries to regroup .
excuse me , driver , do you think you could go any faster ?
could i go any faster ?
yea !
hang on !
yea !
whoa !
no doubt about it , al .
the loss of this ball is going to affect the outcome of this game .
ow !
hey !
come on , kids !
thomas , where are you going ?
it' s just one shot .
you can do it !
we can win this thing !
come on , coop !
you can do it .

well , miss reed helped me for most of it .
but i finished it myself .
joey , this is great .
coop , you know what miss reed told me tonight ?
she said she wants me to be a big sports star .
just like joe cooper .
thanks , dude .
go get ' em , coop !
hey , coop !
when' s the last time you made a home run without la z boy ?
al , we have seen some classic denslow cup battles in the past , but i can' t remember one that ever rivaled ... the drama and excitement of this one .
it' s off the rim !
could be a double play .
darcy tips .
jantzen' s try no .
beers have a shot at the conversion .
remer keeps it alive !
last chance .
coop up .
it' s ... good !
bob , in all my years of calling games ,
i don' t think i' ve ever been this excited !
you' re excited ?
feel these nipples !
we still have no fucking clue where this guy is .
i can wear anything and i can be anything
tonight i don' t wanna feel wonderful
tonight i don' t wanna feel bad
' cause tonight will be the night of my dreams
tonight i don' t wanna feel anything
and then things moved in took no time at all
tonight i don' t wanna feel wonderful

all right , sounds good .
hey , coop !

and so , on behalf of the national baseketball league , we' d like to present to the beers this year' s denslow cup .
congratulations !
go ahead , take your victory lap .
as they skate off , all you can think about is a team that conquered adversity , a team that overcame the odds , a team that defied the critics , a team that blah , blah , blah , blah , a team that , uh
and so , the ideal of sports once again blossomed from a tiny seed , nurtured , as always , by the dreams of the young .
