look at this , so simple
yet majestic , sober
but far from common
its charm lies in its solemnity
this one is brighter , spicier
but don' t brush against it
you could hurt yourself
it' s not for touching , only looking
more discreet than the last one
yet full of surprises
seems dull , but in another light ... ... it will glow like a star
see how it sparkles .

tragic weekend
we' ve a problem in room 413
danial de fouquieres ... ... famous artdealer , lost his wife ... ... in a car accident on friday ... ... on the way to their country house
the funeral is on tuesday ... ... at 4 o' clock at the pere lachaise crematorium
i saw it in the papers , i don' t think it was an accident
open this door , you morons
she' s gone .
an entire week
idiots !
see if she left anything
excuse me
i found something by the phone what ?
keys
a young woman ... ... forgot them at what time ?
6 o' clock ?
pretty , dark , nice figure ?
broke her heel ?
that' s her
she took off her shoes
went out barefoot ; very classy
let me have the keys , then no
but ...
if she comes back for them
can you give her this note ?
certainly , sir
lucien ... excuse me you still here ?
d' you have a minute ?

shocking eh ?
agnes de fouquieres ... ... has gone from us for ever
let us rememher her face
her eyes , her mouth , will lose ... ... their beauty , grace and colour ... ... for our body is earth ... ... and cannot be reborn
life fades
as rain vanishes into grass
we are nothing but ashes
all that remains is memory
memory of what was
and will no longer be
agnes
you remain in our souls
you are in heaven
far from life' s torments
you see our pain
you hear our cries
farewell
receive our tears
so that , alive and dead ... ... your body is but roses
