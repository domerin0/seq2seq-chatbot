with the coming of the second world war ... ... many eyes in imprisoned europe turned hopefully or desperately ... ... toward the freedom of the americas .
lisbon became the great embarkation point .
but not everybody could get to lisbon directly .
and so a torturous , roundabout refugee trail sprang up .
paris to marseilles .
across the mediterranean to oran .
then by train or auto or foot across the rim of africa ... ... to casablanca in french morocco .
here , the fortunate ones , through money or influence or luck ... ... might obtain exit visas and scurry to lisbon .
and from lisbon to the new world .
but the others wait in casablanca .
and wait ... ... and wait ... ... and wait .
two german couriers carrying official documents murdered on train from oran .
murderer and possible accomplices headed for casablanca .
round up all suspicious characters and search them for stolen document .
important .
may we see your papers ?
i don' t have them on me .
in that case , you' il have to come along .
it' s possible that l . . . .
yes .
here they are .
these papers expired three weeks ago .
you' il have to come along .
halt !
what is going on ?
i don' t know , my dear .
pardon me .
have you not heard ?
we hear very little and we understand even less .
two german couriers were found murdered in the unoccupied desert .
this is the customary roundup of refugees , liberals . . . . . . and beautiful girls for mr. renault , the prefect of police .
with these refugees , the scum of europe has gravitated to casablanca .
some have been waiting years for a visa .
i beg of you , monsieur .
watch yourself .
be on guard .
this place is full of vultures .
vultures everywhere .
everywhere .
thank you .
thank you very much .
not at all .
amusing little fellow .
waiter .
how silly of me .
what , dear ?
i' ve left my wallet in the hotel .
perhaps tomorrow we' il be on the plane .
it is good to see you , maj. strasser .
thank you , thank you .
may i present capt. renault , the police prefect .
unoccupied france welcomes you .
thank you , it' s good to be here .
maj. strasser , my aide , lt. casselle .
capt. tonelli , the ltalian service  that is kind of you .
you may find the climate of casablanca a trifle warm .
we germans must get used to all climates , from russia to the sahara .
but you' re not referring to the weather .
what else ?
what' s been done about the murders ?
my men are rounding up twice the usual number of suspects .
but we know who the murderer is .
good .
is he in custody ?
tonight he' il be at rick' s .
everybody comes to rick' s .
i' ve already heard about this caf .
also about mr. rick himself .
for nobody else gave me a thrill
honey , with all your faults i love you still
it had to be you , wonderful you
it had to be you
' cause my hair is curly
waiting , waiting , waiting .
i' il never get out of here .
i' il die in casablanca .
but can' t you make it just a little more , please ?
sorry , but diamonds are a drag on the market .
there are diamonds everywhere .
twenty four hundred .
all right .
the trucks are waiting .
the men are waiting .
everything
it' s the fishing smack santiago .
it leaves at one tomorrow night .
from the end of the marina .
thank you .
and bring 15, 000 francs in cash .
remember , in cash .
cheerio .
open up , abdul .
yes , professor .
waiter ?
yes , madame ?
will you ask rick if he' il have a drink with us ?
madame , he never drinks with customers .
never .
i' ve never seen it .
what makes saloonkeepers so snobbish ?
perhaps if you told him i ran the second largest bank in amsterdam .
the second largest ?
that wouldn' t impress rick .
the leading banker in amsterdam is now the pastry chef here .
we have something to look forward to .
and his father is the bellboy .
good !
excuse me .
i' m sorry , sir .
this is a private room .
of all the nerve !
who do you think i know there is gambling in there !
you dare not keep me out !
what' s the trouble ?
i have been in every gambling room from honolulu to berlin .
if you think i' il be kept out of a saloon like this , you' re mistaken .
excuse me , please .
hello , rick .
your cash is good at the bar .
what ?
do you know who i am ?
i do .
you' re lucky the bar is open to you .
this is outrageous !
i shall report it to the angriff !
watching you now , one would think you' ve been doing this all your life .
what makes you think i haven' t ?
nothing .
but when you first came , i thought  you thought what ?
what right do i have to think ?
may l ?
too bad about those two german couriers .
they got lucky .
yesterday , they were just clerks .
today , they' re the honored dead .
you' re a very cynical person .
forgive me for saying so .
i forgive you .
will you have a drink with me ?
i forgot you never drink with i' il have another , please .
you despise me , don' t you ?
if i gave you any thought , i would .
but why ?
you object to the kind of business i do , huh ?
but think of all those poor refugees who must rot here if i didn' t help them .
that' s not so bad .
through ways of my own , i provide them with exit visas .
for a price , ugarte .
for a price .
think of the poor devils who can' t meet renault' s price .
i get it for them for half .
is that so parasitic ?
i don' t mind a parasite .
i object to a cut rate one .
after tonight , i' il be through with the whole business .
and i' m leaving , finally , this casablanca .
who' d you bribe for your visa ?
renault or yourself ?
myself .
i found myself much more reasonable .
look , rick .
you know what this is ?
something that even you have never seen .
letters of transit signed by general de gaulle .
cannot be rescinded .
not even questioned .
one moment .
tonight , i' il be selling those for more money than even i ever dreamed of .
and then , addio , casablanca .
i have many a friend in casablanca , but just because you despise me . . . . . . you are the only one i trust .
will you keep these for me ?
for how long ?
an hour .
perhaps a little longer .
i don' t want them overnight .
don' t be afraid of that .
please keep them for me .
thank you .
i knew i could trust you .
waiter , i' il be expecting some people .
if anybody asks for me , i' il be right here .
rick . . . . . . i hope you' re more impressed with me now .
i' il share my good luck with your roulette wheel .
just a moment .
i heard a rumor those german couriers were carrying letters of transit .
i' ve heard that rumor too .
poor devils .
you' re right , ugarte .
i am a little more impressed with you .
say , who ' s got trouble ?
we got trouble
how much trouble ?
too much trouble
well now , don ' t you frown just knuckle down and knock on wood
who ' s unhappy ?
we' re unhappy
how unhappy ?
too unhappy
that won ' t do when you are blue , just knock on wood
how unlucky ?
too unlucky
but your luck' il change lf you' il arrange to knock on wood
who ' s got nothing ?
we got nothing
now who ' s lucky ?
we' re all lucky
just how lucky ?
very lucky
well , smile up , then and once again
let' s knock on wood
hello , rick .
hello , ferrari .
how' s business at the blue parrot ?
fine , but i' d like to buy your caf .
it' s not for sale .
you haven' t heard my offer .
it' s not for sale at any price .
what do you want for sam ?
i don' t buy or sell human beings .
that' s casablanca' s leading commodity .
in refugees alone , we can make a fortune together in the black market .
suppose you run your business and let me run mine .
suppose we ask sam .
maybe he' d like to make a change .
suppose we do .
when will you realize that in this world isolationism is not a practical policy ?
ferrari wants you to work for him at the blue parrot .
i like it fine here .
he' il double what i pay you .
but i ain' t got time to spend money .
sorry .
the boss' s private stock .
because , yvonne , i love you .
shut up .
all right .
for you , i shut up .
because , yvonne , i love you .
monsieur rick .
some germans gave this check .
is it all right ?
where were you last night ?
that' s so long ago , i don' t remember .
will i see you tonight ?
i never make plans that far ahead .
give me another .
she' s had enough .
don' t listen to him .
fill it up .
yvonne , i love you , but he pays me .
i' m tired of having you  sascha , call a cab .
we' il get your coat .
take your hands off !
you' re going home .
you' ve had too much to drink .
hey , taxi !
who do you think you are , pushing me ?
what a fool i was to fall for you .
go with her .
be sure she gets home .
yes , boss .
come right back .
yes , boss .
hello , rick .
hello , louis .
how extravagant , throwing away women like that .
someday , they may be scarce .
i think i shall pay a call on yvonne .
maybe get her on the rebound .
when it comes to women , you' re a true democrat .
if he gets a word in , it' il be a major ltalian victory .
the plane to lisbon .
you would like to be on it ?
why ?
what' s in lisbon ?
the clipper to america .
i' ve speculated on why you don' t return to america .
did you abscond with the church funds ?
run off with a senator' s wife ?
i like to think you killed a man .
it' s the romantic in me .
it' s a combination of all three .
what brought you to casablanca ?
my health .
i came to casablanca for the waters .
the waters ?
what waters ?
we' re in the desert .
i was misinformed .
excuse me , rick .
a gentleman inside has won 20, 000 francs . . . . . . and the cashier would like some money .
i' il get it from the safe .
i' m so upset .
you know
forget it , emil .
mistakes happen all the time .
i' m awfully sorry .
there' il be some excitement tonight .
an arrest in your caf .
again ?
this is no ordinary arrest .
a murderer , no less .
if you' re thinking of warning him , don' t .
he cannot escape .
i stick my neck out for nobody .
a wise foreign policy .
we could' ve arrested him at the blue parrot .
out of my regard for you , we' re staging it here .
it will amuse your customers .
our entertainment' s enough .
we' il have an important guest tonight .
maj. strasser , of the third reich .
we want him to see the arrest as a demonstration of our efficiency .
i see .
what' s strasser doing here ?
he didn' t come here to witness a demonstration of your efficiency .
perhaps not .
here you are .
it won' t happen again .
that' s all right .
louis , there' s something on your mind .
why don' t you spill it ?
how observant you are .
i wanted to give you a word of advice .
yeah ?
have a brandy ?
thank you .
there are exit visas sold in this caf , but we know you' ve never sold one .
that' s why we let you remain open .
i thought it was because i let you win at roulette .
that is another reason .
there' s a man arrived here on his way to america .
he' il offer a fortune to anyone who' il get him a visa .
what' s his name ?
victor laszlo .
victor laszlo ?
that' s the first time i' ve seen you impressed .
he' s succeeded in impressing half the world .
it' s my duty to see he doesn' t impress the other half .
rick , laszlo must never reach america .
he stays in casablanca .
it' il be interesting to see how he manages .
manages what ?
his escape .
but i just told you  stop it .
he escaped the concentration camp .
nazis have chased him through europe .
this is the end of the chase .
twenty thousand francs says it isn' t .
is that a serious offer ?
i just paid 20 .
i' d like to get it back .
make it 10 .
i' m only a poor , corrupt official .
okay .
done .
no matter how clever he is , he still needs a visa .
or , i should say , two .
why two ?
he is traveling with a lady .
he' il take one .
i think not .
i' ve seen her .
if he did not leave her in marseilles or in oran . . . . . . he won' t leave her in casablanca .
maybe he' s not quite as romantic as you .
it doesn' t matter .
there is no exit visa for him .
what ever gave you the impression that i might help laszlo escape ?
because i suspect that under that cynical shell . . . . . . you' re at heart a sentimentalist .
laugh if you will .
i' m familiar with your record .
let me point out just two items .
in 1935 , you ran guns to ethiopia .
in 1936 , you fought in spain on the loyalist side .
and got well paid on both occasions .
the winning side would' ve paid much better .
maybe .
it seems you' re determined to keep laszlo here .
i have my orders .
i see .
gestapo spank .
you overestimate the influence of the gestapo .
i don' t interfere with them and they don' t interfere with me .
in casablanca , i am master of my fate .
i am  maj. strasser is here , sir .
you were saying ?
excuse me .
carl , see that the major gets a good table , close to the ladies .
i' ve already given him the best , knowing he is german and would take it anyway .
take him quietly .
two guards at every door .
everything is ready , sir .
go ahead .
good evening , gentlemen .
good evening , captain .
won' t you join us ?
thank you .
it' s a pleasure to have you here .
champagne and a tin of caviar .
may i recommend veuve clicquot ' 26 ?
a good french wine .
very well , sir .
a very interesting club .
especially so tonight .
you' il see the arrest of the man who murdered your couriers .
i expected no less , captain .
monsieur ugarte .
will you please come with us ?
certainly .
may i first cash my chips ?
very lucky .
two thousand , please .
two thousand .
thank you .
rick , help me !
don' t be a fool .
you can' t get away .
rick , hide me !
you must help me !
do something !
rick !
excellent , captain .
when they come to get me , i hope you' il be more help .
i stick my neck out for nobody .
i' m sorry there was a disturbance , folks , but it' s all over now .
sit down and have a good time .
enjoy yourselves .
all right , sam .
this is maj. heinrich strasser of the third reich .
how do you do ?
how do you do ?
you know herr heinz of the third reich .
please join us , mr. rick .
we are very honored tonight .
maj. strasser is one reason the third reich enjoys its reputation .
you say " third reich " as though you expect there to be others .
personally , major , i will take what comes .
do you mind if i ask a few questions ?
unofficially , of course .
make it official if you like .
what is your nationality ?
i' m a drunkard .
that makes rick a citizen of the world .
i was born in new york city , if that' il help you .
i understand you came here from paris during the occupation .
there seems to be no secret about that .
are you one of those who can' t imagine germans in their beloved paris ?
it' s not particularly my beloved paris .
can you imagine us in london ?
when you get there , ask me .
diplomatist !
how about new york ?
there are sections of new york that i wouldn' t advise you to try to invade .
who will win the war ?
i haven' t the slightest idea .
rick is neutral about everything .
and that takes in . . . . . . the field of women too .
you weren' t always so carefully neutral .
we have a complete dossier on you .
richard blaine , american .
age , 37 .
cannot return to his country .
the reason is vague .
we know what you did in paris . . . . . . and why you left paris .
don' t worry , we won' t broadcast it .
are my eyes really brown ?
you will forgive my curiosity .
the point is , an enemy of the reich has come to casablanca . . . . . . and we are checking up on anyone who can be of any help .
my interest in whether laszlo stays or goes is purely a sporting one .
in this case , you have no sympathy for the fox ?
not particularly .
i understand the hound' s point of view too .
laszlo published the foulest lies in the prague newspapers till we marched in .
and even after that , he continued to print scandal sheets in a cellar .
of course , one must admit he has great courage .
he' s clever .
three times he slipped through our fingers .
in paris , he continued his activities .
we intend not to let it happen again .
excuse me .
your business is politics , mine is running a saloon .
good evening , mr. blaine .
you see , major ?
you have nothing to worry about rick .
perhaps .
yes , monsieur ?
i reserved a table .
victor laszlo .
yes , monsieur .
right this way .
two cointreaux , please .
i saw no one of ugarte' s description .
victor , i feel somehow we shouldn' t stay here .
if we' d walk out so soon it' d only call attention to us .
perhaps he' s in some other part of the caf .
excuse me , but you look like a couple who are on their way to america .
you' il find a market for this ring .
i must sell it at a great sacrifice .
thank you , but i don' t  perhaps for the lady .
the ring is quite unique .
yes , i' m very interested .
good .
your name ?
berger , norwegian .
at your service .
i' il meet you at the bar later .
we don' t want the ring , but thank you for showing it to us .
such a bargain .
that is your decision ?
it is .
monsieur laszlo , is it not ?
yes .
captain renault , prefect of police .
what do you want ?
to welcome you to casablanca and to wish you a pleasant stay .
it isn' t often we have so distinguished a visitor .
thank you .
i hope you' il forgive me , captain .
the present french administration hasn' t always been so cordial .
may i present miss ilsa lund ?
i was told you were the most beautiful woman to visit casablanca .
that was a gross understatement .
you' re very kind .
won' t you join us ?
if you' il permit me .
emil , please .
a bottle of your best champagne .
put it on my bill .
it' s a game we play .
they put it on the bill , i tear it up .
very convenient .
captain , the boy who' s playing the piano . . . .
somewhere i' ve seen him .
sam ?
yes .
he came from paris with rick .
rick ?
who' s he ?
you are in rick' s .
rick is . . . .
is what ?
mademoiselle , he' s the kind of man if i were a woman . . . . . . and i weren' t around , i' d be in love with rick .
but what a fool i am talking to a beautiful woman about another man .
excuse me .
major .
mademoiselle and monsieur , may i present maj. strasser ?
how do you do ?
this is a pleasure i' ve looked forward to .
i' m sure you' il excuse me if i' m not gracious .
but you see , i am a czechoslovakian .
you were a czechoslovakian .
now you' re a subject of the german reich .
i' ve never accepted that privilege .
and i' m now on french soil .
i' d like to discuss some matters arising from your presence on french soil .
this is hardly the time or the place .
then we' il state another time and place .
tomorrow at 10 in the prefect' s office .
with mademoiselle .
capt. renault , i am under your authority .
is it your order we come to your office ?
let us say it is my request .
that is a much more pleasant word .
very well .
a very clever tactical retreat , major .
this time , they really mean to stop me .
victor , i' m afraid for you .
we' ve been in difficult places before , haven' t we ?
i must find out what berger knows .
be careful .
i will .
don' t worry .
mr. berger , the ring .
could i see it again ?
champagne cocktail , please .
i recognize you from the news photographs .
in a concentration camp , one is apt to lose a little weight .
i read five times that you were killed in five places .
as you see , it was true every single time .
thank heaven i found you .
i' m looking for a man named ugarte .
he' s supposed to help me .
ugarte cannot even help himself .
he' s under arrest for murder .
he was arrested here tonight .
i see .
but we , who are still free , will do all we can .
we are organized .
underground , like everywhere else .
tomorrow night , there is a meeting at the caf du roi .
if you' il come
will you ask the piano player to come over here ?
very well , mademoiselle .
how' s the jewelry business ?
not so good .
check , please .
too bad you weren' t here earlier .
we had quite a bit of excitement , right ?
yes .
excuse me , gentlemen .
my bill .
no .
two champagnes .
please .
yes , sir .
hello , sam .
hello , miss ilsa .
i never expected to see you again .
it' s been a long time .
yes , ma' am .
a lot of water under the bridge .
some of the old songs , sam .
yes , ma' am .
where is rick ?
i don' t know .
i ain' t seen him all night .
when will he be back ?
not tonight no more .
he ain' t coming
he went home .
does he always leave so early ?
oh , he never he' s got a girl up at the blue parrot .
goes up there all the time .
you used to be a much better liar , sam .
leave him alone , miss ilsa .
you' re bad luck to him .
play it once , sam .
for old time' s sake .
i don' t know what you mean , miss ilsa .
play it , sam .
play " as time goes by .
i can' t remember it .
i' m a little rusty on it .
i' il hum it for you .
sing it , sam .
you must remember this
a kiss is just a kiss
a sigh is just a sigh
the fundamental things apply
as time goes by
and when two lovers woo
they still say , " i love you
on that you can rely
no matter what the future brings
as time goes by
sam , i thought i told you never to play
you were asking about rick and here he is .
may i present
hello , ilsa .
hello , rick .
you' ve already met rick ?
then perhaps you also
this is mr. laszlo .
how do you do ?
how do you do ?
one hears a great deal about rick in casablanca .
and about victor laszlo everywhere .
join us for a drink ?
rick never
thanks , i will .
well !
a precedent is being broken .
emil ?
a very interesting caf .
i congratulate you .
i congratulate you .
what for ?
your work .
thank you .
i try .
we all try .
you succeed .
she was asking about you earlier . . . . . . in a way that made me extremely jealous .
i wasn' t sure you were the same .
the last time we met  was la belle aurore .
how nice .
you remembered .
that was the day the germans marched into paris .
not an easy day to forget .
i remember every detail .
the germans wore gray , you wore blue .
yes .
i put that dress away .
when the germans march out , i' il wear it again .
you' re becoming quite human .
i suppose we have to thank you for that .
ilsa , i don' t wish to be the one to say it , but it' s late .
so it is .
we have a curfew here in casablanca .
it wouldn' t do for the chief of police to be drinking after hours .
i hope we didn' t overstay our welcome .
your check , sir .
my party .
another precedent gone .
this has been a very interesting evening .
i' il call you a cab .
gasoline rationing , time of night . . . .
we' il come again .
anytime .
say good night to sam .
i will .
there' s still nobody in the world who can play " as time goes by " like sam .
he hasn' t played it in a long time .
good night .
good night .
a very puzzling fellow .
what sort is he ?
i really can' t say , though i saw him quite often in paris .
tomorrow at 10 at the prefect office .
we' il be there .
good night .
boss ?
boss ?
yeah ?
ain' t you going to bed ?
not right now .
ain' t you planning on going to bed in the near future ?
you ever going to bed ?
no !
i ain' t sleepy either .
then have a drink .
not me .
well , don' t have a drink .
let' s get out of here .
no , sir .
i' m waiting for a lady .
let' s go .
ain' t nothing but trouble for you here .
i know she' s coming back .
we' il drive all night .
we' il get drunk and stay away till she' s gone .
shut up and go home , will you ?
no , sir .
i' m staying right here .
they grab ugarte , then she walks in .
that' s the way it goes .
one in , one out .
sam .
yes , boss .
if it' s december , 1941 , in casablanca , what time is it in new york ?
what ?
my watch stopped .
i bet they' re asleep in new york .
i bet they' re asleep all over america .
of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world . . . . . . she walks into mine .
what are you playing ?
a little something of my own .
stop it .
you know what i wanna hear .
i don' t .
you played it for her , you can play it for me .
i don' t remember  if she can stand it , i can .
play it !
yes , boss .
who are you really ?
and what were you before ?
what did you do and what did you think ?
we said no questions .
here' s looking at you , kid .
a franc for your thoughts .
in america they' d bring only a penny .
i guess that' s about all they' re worth .
i' m willing to be overcharged .
tell me .
well , i was wondering . . .
. . . why i' m so lucky , why i should find you waiting for me to come along ?
why there is no other man in my life ?
that' s easy .
there was .
he' s dead .
i' m sorry for asking .
i forgot we said no questions .
only one answer can take care of all our questions .
nothing can stop them now .
wednesday they' il be in paris .
they' il find out your record .
it won' t be safe here .
i' m on their blacklist already .
their " roll of honor .
hearts full of passion
jealousy and hate
woman needs man
and man must have his mate
that no one can deny
it' s still the same old story
a fight for love and glory
a case of do or die
the world will always welcome lovers
as time goes by
henri wants us to finish three more bottles .
he' il water his garden with champagne before he lets the germans drink it .
this ought to take the sting out of being occupied .
you said it .
here' s looking at you , kid .
my german' s a little rusty .
it' s the gestapo .
they say they expect to be in paris tomorrow .
they' re telling us how to act when they come marching in .
with the world crumbling , we pick this time to fall in love .
yeah , it' s pretty bad timing .
where were you 10 years ago ?
ten years ago ?
let' s see . . . .
yes , i was having a brace put on my teeth .
where were you ?
looking for a job .
was that cannon fire ?
or my heart pounding ?
it' s the german 77th , and judging by the sound , only about 35 miles away .
and getting closer every minute .
here , here , drink up .
we' il never finish the other three .
germans will be here pretty soon and they' il come looking for you .
there' s a price on your head .
i left a note in my apartment .
they' il know where to find me .
it' s strange .
i know so very little about you .
i know little about you .
except that you had your teeth straightened .
be serious .
you' re in danger .
you must leave paris .
no , we must leave .
yes , of course .
we .
the train for marseilles leaves at 5 .
i' il pick you up at your hotel at 4 : 30 .
not at my hotel .
i. . . .
i have things to do in the city before i leave .
i' il meet you at the station .
all right , at a quarter to 5 .
why don' t we marry in marseilles ?
that' s too far ahead to plan .
i guess it is a little too far ahead .
what about the engineer ?
why can' t he marry us on the train ?
why not ?
the captain on a ship can .
it doesn' t seem fair that
what' s wrong , kid ?
i love you so much .
and i hate this war so much .
it' s a crazy world .
anything can happen .
if you shouldn' t get away . . . .
if something should keep us apart . . . . . . wherever they put you . . . . . . and wherever i' il be , i want you to know that l
kiss me .
kiss me as if it were the last time .
all aboard !
the last train leaving in three minutes .
have you seen her ?
i can' t find her .
she checked out of the hotel .
but this note came just after you left .
that' s the last call , mr. richard .
do you hear me ?
come on , mr. richard .
let' s get out of here .
come on .
rick , i have to talk to you .
i saved my first drink to have with you .
here .
no , rick .
not tonight .
especially tonight .
why did you have to come to casablanca ?
there are other places .
i wouldn' t have come if i' d known that you were here .
believe me , it' s true .
i didn' t know .
it' s funny how your voice hasn' t changed .
i can still hear it .
richard , dear , i' il go with you anyplace .
we' il get on a train and never stop . " don' t , rick .
i can understand how you feel .
you understand how i feel ?
how long was it we had , honey ?
i didn' t count the days .
well , i did .
every one of them .
mostly , i remember the last one .
the " wow " finish .
a guy standing on a platform in the rain . . . . . . with a comical look on his face from his insides having been kicked out .
can i tell you a story , rick ?
has it got a " wow " finish ?
i don' t know the finish yet .
go on , tell it .
maybe one will come to you as you go along .
it' s about a girl who' d just come to paris from her home in oslo .
at the house of some friends . . . . . . she met a man about whom she' d heard her whole life .
a very great and courageous man .
he opened up for her a beautiful world full of knowledge , thoughts and ideals .
everything she knew or ever became was because of him .
she looked up to him and worshiped him . . . . . . with a feeling she supposed was love .
yes , that' s very pretty .
i heard a story once .
i' ve heard a lot of stories in my time .
they went along with the sound of a tinny piano . . . . . . playing in the parlor downstairs .
mister , i met a man once when i was a kid , " they' d always begin .
i guess neither one of our stories is very funny .
tell me . . .
. . . who was it you left me for ?
was it laszlo , or were there others in between . . . . . . or aren' t you the kind that tells ?
i suspect ugarte left the letters of transit with mr. blaine .
i suggest you search the caf immediately .
if rick has them , he' s too smart to let you find them there .
you give him credit for too much cleverness .
my impression was that he' s just another blundering american .
we mustn' t underestimate american blundering .
i was with them when they blundered into berlin in 1918 .
as to laszlo , we want him watched 24 hours a day .
it may interest you to know that at this moment he' s on his way here .
there' s nothing we can do .
i' m delighted to see you both .
did you rest well ?
i slept well .
that' s strange .
nobody' s supposed to sleep well in casablanca .
may we proceed with the business ?
with pleasure .
sit down .
we won' t mince words .
you' re an escaped prisoner of the reich .
so far , you' ve been fortunate enough in eluding us .
you have reached casablanca .
it is my duty to see that you stay here .
whether or not you' il succeed is problematic .
not at all .
renault' s signature is necessary on every visa .
is it possible herr laszlo will receive a visa ?
i' m afraid not .
my regrets , monsieur .
well , perhaps i shall like it in casablanca .
and mademoiselle ?
you needn' t be concerned about me .
is that all you wish to tell us ?
don' t be in a hurry .
you have all the time in the world .
you may be in casablanca indefinitely .
or you may leave for lisbon tomorrow .
on one condition .
and that is ?
you know the leader of the underground movement in paris , in prague . . . . . . in brussels , in amsterdam , in oslo , in belgrade , in athens . . . .
even berlin .
yes , even in berlin .
if you' il furnish me with their names and whereabouts , you' il have your visa .
and the honor of having served the third reich .
i was in a german concentration camp for a year .
that' s honor enough for a lifetime .
you' il give us the names ?
if i didn' t give them to you in a concentration camp . . . . . . where you had more persuasive methods at your disposal . . . . . . i certainly won' t give them to you now .
what if you track them down and kill them ?
what if you murdered us all ?
from every corner of europe , hundreds , thousands would rise to take our places .
even nazis can' t kill that fast .
you have a reputation for eloquence , which i can now understand .
but you' re mistaken .
you said enemies of the reich could be replaced .
there is one exception .
no one could take your place if anything unfortunate . . . . . . should occur to you while you' re trying to escape .
you won' t dare to interfere with me here .
this is still unoccupied france .
any violation of neutrality would reflect on the captain .
insofar as it is in my power . . . .
thank you .
by the way , last night you evinced an interest in senor ugarte .
yes .
you have a message for him .
nothing important .
may i speak to him now ?
you would find the conversation a trifle one sided .
senor ugarte is dead .
i' m making the report .
we haven' t quite decided whether he committed suicide . . . . . . or died trying to escape .
are you finished with us ?
for the time being .
good day .
their next step will be to the black market .
excuse me , captain .
another visa problem has come up .
show her in .
sorry , we wouldn' t be able to handle the police .
this is a job for senor ferrari .
ferrari ?
it can be most helpful to know ferrari .
he has a monopoly on the black market here .
you' il find him at the blue parrot .
thanks .
don' t be too downhearted .
perhaps you can come to terms with capt. renault .
hello , ferrari .
good morning , rick .
i see the bus is in .
i' il take my shipment .
no hurry .
have a drink .
i never drink in the morning .
every time you send my shipment , it' s always a bit short .
carrying charges , my boy .
here , sit down .
there' s something i want to talk over with you .
the news about ugarte upsets me .
you' re a fat hypocrite .
you don' t feel any sorrier than i do .
of course not .
what upsets me is that he' s dead and no one knows where those letters are .
practically no one .
if i had those letters , i could make a fortune .
so could i , and i' m a poor businessman .
i' ve a proposition for whoever has them .
i' il handle the transaction .
get rid of the letters , take all the risk , for a small fee .
and the carrying charges ?
naturally , there will be a few incidental expenses .
that' s my proposition for whoever has the letters .
i' il tell him when he comes in .
i' il put my cards out .
i think you know where they are .
you' re in good company .
renault and strasser probably think so too .
i came over here to give them a chance to ransack my place .
don' t be a fool .
take me into your confidence .
you need a partner .
excuse me , i' il be getting back .
good morning .
ferrari is the fat gent at the table .
you won' t find a treasure like this in all morocco .
only 700 francs .
you' re being cheated .
it doesn' t matter , thank you .
for friends of rick' s we have a small discount .
did i say 700 francs ?
you can have it for 200 .
i' m sorry i was in no condition to receive you last night .
it doesn' t matter .
special friends of rick' s get a special discount .
one hundred francs .
your story had me confused , or maybe it was the bourbon .
i have some tablecloths
i' m really not interested .
please , one minute .
did you come back to tell me why you ran out on me at the station ?
yes .
you can tell me now .
i' m reasonably sober .
i don' t think i will .
why not ?
i got stuck with the railway ticket .
i' m entitled to know .
last night i saw what has happened to you .
the rick i knew in paris , i could tell him .
he' d understand .
but the one who looked at me with such hatred . . . .
i' il be leaving soon and we' il never see each other again .
we knew very little about each other when we were in love in paris .
if we leave it that way , maybe we' il remember those days , and not casablanca .
not last night .
did you run out on me because you knew what it' d be like ?
hiding from the police , running away all the time ?
believe that if you want to .
i' m not running away anymore .
i' m settled now .
above a saloon , it' s true , but . . . .
walk up a flight .
i' il be expecting you .
all the same , someday you' il lie to laszlo .
you' il be there .
no , rick .
no .
you see , victor laszlo is my husband .
and was , even when i knew you in paris .
i was just telling laszlo that , unfortunately , i' m not able to help him .
the word has gone around .
as leader of all illegal activities , i' m an influential and respected man .
but it' d not be worth my life to do anything for laszlo .
you , however , are a different matter .
senor ferrari thinks it might just be possible to get an exit visa for you .
you mean for me to go on alone ?
and only alone .
i' il stay and keep trying .
i' m sure in a little while
might as well be frank .
it' d take a miracle to get you out .
the germans have outlawed miracles .
we' re only interested in two visas .
please , ilsa , don' t be hasty .
no , victor .
you two will want to discuss this .
excuse me .
i' il be at the bar .
no , i won' t let you stay here .
you must get to america .
somehow i' il get out and join you .
if the situation were different . . . . . . if i had to stay and there was only one visa . . . . . . would you take it ?
yes , i would .
yes , i see .
when i had trouble getting out of lille . . . . . . why didn' t you leave me ?
when i was sick in marseilles for two weeks and you were in danger . . . . . . why didn' t you leave me ?
i meant to .
something always held me up .
i love you very much .
your secret will be safe with me .
ferrari is waiting for our answer .
not more than 50 francs .
we' ve decided , senor ferrari .
for the present we' re looking for two visas .
thank you very much .
good luck , but be careful .
you know you' re being shadowed ?
it becomes instinct .
i observe that you , in one respect , are very fortunate .
i' il make one suggestion .
why , i do not know .
it cannot possibly profit me .
have you heard about the letters of transit ?
yes , something .
they were not found on ugarte when they arrested him .
you know where they are ?
not for sure .
but my guess is ugarte left those letters with rick .
he' s a difficult man .
one never knows what he' il do , or why .
but it is worth a chance .
thank you very much .
good day .
bye .
thank you for your coffee .
i shall miss that when we leave .
it was gracious of you to share it with me .
monsieur .
good day .
here' s to you , sir .
good luck .
i' d better be going .
check , please .
i have to warn you .
this is a dangerous place , full of vultures .
vultures everywhere .
thanks .
goodbye .
it has been a pleasure to meet you .
i' m sorry .
you are getting to be your best customer .
well , drinking !
i' m very pleased with you .
you' re beginning to live like a frenchman .
that' s some going over your men gave my place .
we barely got cleaned up in time to open .
i told strasser he wouldn' t find the letters .
but i told my men to be especially destructive .
you know how that impresses germans .
rick , have you got those letters of transit ?
louis , are you pro vichy or free french ?
serves me right for asking a direct question .
the subject is closed .
it looks like you' re a little late .
so yvonne' s gone over to the enemy .
who knows ? ln her own way , she may constitute an entire second front .
it' s time for me to flatter strasser .
i' il see you later .
sascha !
french ' 75 .
put up the whole row of those .
starting here and ending here .
we will begin with two .
what did you say ?
would you repeat it ?
what i said is not your business .
i' il make it my business .
i don' t like disturbances in my place .
lay off politics or get out .
you see , captain ?
the situation is not under control .
we' re trying to cooperate with your government .
we can' t regulate our people' s feelings .
are you certain which side you' re on ?
i have no conviction .
i blow with the wind . . . . . . and the prevailing wind is from vichy .
and if it should change ?
surely the reich doesn' t admit that possibility ?
we' re concerned about more than casablanca .
every french province in africa is honeycombed with traitors . . . . . . waiting for their chance , waiting perhaps for a leader .
a leader ?
like laszlo ?
i have been thinking .
it is too dangerous if you let him go or let him stay .
i see what you mean .
thank you , carl .
thank you , carl .
sit down .
have a brandy with us .
to celebrate our leaving for america tomorrow .
thank you very much .
i thought you' d ask me , so i brought the good brandy . . . . . . and the dress glass .
at last the day' s came !
we are speaking nothing but english now .
so we should feel at home when we get to america .
a very nice idea .
to america .
to america .
what watch ?
ten watch .
such much ?
you' il get along beautifully in america .
how is lady luck treating you ?
oh , too bad .
you' il find him over there .
monsieur rick ?
could i speak to you ?
how' d you get in ?
you' re underage .
i came with capt. renault .
i should' ve known .
my husband is with me too .
he is ?
renault' s getting broad minded .
sit down .
have a drink ?
of course not .
you mind if i do ?
monsieur rick , what kind of a man is capt. renault ?
like any other man , only more so .
no , i mean . . . .
is he trustworthy ? ls his word
who told you to ask me that ?
he did .
capt. renault .
i thought so .
where' s your husband ?
at the roulette table , trying to win enough for our exit visas .
of course he' s losing .
how long have you been married ?
eight weeks .
we come from bulgaria .
things are very bad there .
the devil has the people by the throat .
so jan and i , we . . . .
we don' t want our children to grow up there .
so you decided to go to america .
but we have not much money . . . . . . and traveling is so expensive and difficult .
it was more than we thought to get here .
then capt. renault sees us .
he' s so kind .
he wants to help us .
yes , i' il bet .
he tells me he can give us an exit visa .
but we have no money .
does he know that ?
yes .
and he' s still willing to give you a visa ?
you want to know . . . .
will he keep his word ?
he always has .
you are a man .
if someone loved you very much . . . . . . so that your happiness was the only thing she wanted in the world . . . . . . and she did a bad thing to make certain of it . . . . . . could you forgive her ?
nobody ever loved me that much .
and he never knew , and the girl kept this bad thing locked in her heart . . . . . . that would be all right ?
you want my advice ?
yes , please .
go back to bulgaria .
but if you knew what it means to us to leave europe , to get to america .
but if jan should find out . . . .
he is such a boy .
in many ways , i am so much older than he is .
yes , everybody in casablanca has problems .
yours may work out .
you' il excuse me .
good evening .
see ?
here we are again .
i' il take that as a compliment to sam .
i suppose he means to you paris of happier days .
he does .
could we have a table close to him ?
and as far away from strasser as possible .
the geography may be difficult to arrange .
paul , table 30 .
right this way , if you please .
i' il have sam play " as time goes by . " i believe that' s your favorite .
thank you .
two cognac , please .
do you wish to place another bet , sir ?
no , i guess not .
have you tried 22 tonight ?
i said " 22 .
leave it there .
cash it in and don' t come back .
are you sure this place is honest ?
honest ?
as honest as the day is long .
how are we doing tonight ?
a couple of thousand less than i thought there would be .
he' s just a lucky guy .
monsieur rick , may i get you a cup of coffee ?
no thanks , carl .
capt. renault , may l  not here , please .
come to my office .
we' il be businesslike .
we' il be there at 6 .
i' il be there at 10 .
i' m very happy for both of you .
still , it' s very strange that you won .
well , maybe not so strange .
i' il see you in the morning .
thank you so much .
boss , you' ve done a beautiful thing .
go away , you crazy russian .
as i suspected .
you' re a rank sentimentalist .
why ?
why interfere with my little romances ?
put it down as a gesture to love .
i forgive you this time .
but i' il be in tomorrow with a breathtaking blonde .
and it' il make me very happy if she loses .
i wonder if i could talk to you ?
go ahead .
isn' t there some other place ?
it' s rather confidential , what i have to say .
in my office .
right .
you know it' s very important i get out of casablanca .
i' m privileged to be one of the leaders of a great movement .
you know what i' ve been doing .
you know what it means to the work , to the lives of thousands of people . . . . . . that i continue my work .
i' m not interested in politics .
the problems of the world are not in my department .
i' m a saloonkeeper .
my friends in the underground tell me that you' ve quite a record .
you ran guns to ethiopia .
you fought the fascists in spain .
what of it ?
isn' t it strange you always seem to fight with the underdog ?
i found that an expensive hobby .
but then i never was much of a businessman .
are you enough of a businessman to appreciate 100, 000 francs ?
i appreciate it , but i don' t accept it .
i' il raise it to 200, 000 .
make it a million francs or three .
my answer would still be the same .
there' s a reason you won' t let me have them .
there is .
i suggest that you ask your wife .
i beg your pardon ?
i said , ask your wife .
my wife ?
yes .
play " la marseillaise . " play it !
see ? lf laszlo' s presence in a caf can inspire this demonstration . . . . . . what more will his presence here bring on ?
i advise that this place be shut up at once .
everybody' s having a good time .
much too good a time .
the place is to be closed .
but i' ve no excuse to close it .
find one .
everyone is to leave immediately .
this caf is closed until further notice .
clear the room at once !
on what grounds ?
i' m shocked to find that gambling is going on in here .
your winnings , sir .
thank you .
everybody out at once !
after this disturbance , it' s not safe for laszlo to stay in casablanca .
this morning it wasn' t safe for him to leave .
that' s also true , except to return to occupied france .
occupied france ?
under safe conduct from me .
of what value is that ?
remember what german guarantees have been worth in the past .
there are only two other alternatives .
what are they ?
french authorities may find a reason to put him in the concentration camp here .
the other alternative ?
perhaps you have already observed that , in casablanca , human life is cheap .
good night , mademoiselle .
what happened with rick ?
we' il discuss it later .
our faithful friend is still there .
please don' t go to the underground meeting .
i must .
it isn' t often that a man gets to display heroics before his wife .
don' t joke .
after strasser' s warning tonight , i' m frightened .
i' m frightened too .
shall i remain here in a hotel room , hiding ?
or carry on the best i can ?
whatever i' d say , you would carry on .
why don' t you tell me about rick ?
what did you find out ?
apparently he has the letters .
yes ?
but he won' t sell them .
i' d think if sentiment won' t persuade him , money would .
did he give you any reason ?
he suggested i ask you .
ask me ?
yes .
he said , " ask your wife .
i don' t know why he said that .
our friend outside will think we' ve retired by now .
i' il be going in a few minutes .
ilsa , l  yes ?
when i was in the concentration camp . . . . . . were you lonely in paris ?
yes , victor .
i was .
i know how it is to be lonely .
is there anything you wish to tell me ?
no , victor .
there isn' t .
i love you very much .
yes .
yes , i know .
whatever i do , will you believe that l
you don' t even have to say it .
i' il believe .
good night , dear .
good night .
yes , dear ?
be careful .
of course i' il be careful .
well , you are in pretty good shape , herr rick .
how long can i afford to stay closed ?
two weeks , maybe three .
maybe i won' t have to .
a bribe worked before .
in the meantime , everybody stays on salary .
thank you .
sascha will be happy to hear it .
i owe him money .
you finish locking up , will you ?
i will .
then i' m going to the meeting  don' t tell me .
i won' t .
good night .
good night , mr. rick .
how did you get in ?
the stairs from the street .
i told you you' d come around , but this is ahead of schedule .
won' t you sit down ?
richard , i had to see you .
" richard " again .
we' re back in paris .
your visit isn' t connected by any chance with the letters of transit ?
as long as i have them , i' il never be lonely .
ask any price , but give me those letters .
i went through that with your husband .
it' s no deal .
i know how you feel about me . . . . . . but please put that aside for something important .
do i have to hear again how great your husband is . . . . . . what an important cause he' s fighting for ?
it was your cause too .
in your way you were fighting for the same thing .
i' m not fighting for anything anymore , except myself .
i' m the only cause i' m interested in .
we loved each other once .
if those days meant anything at all
i wouldn' t bring up paris .
it' s poor salesmanship .
listen .
if you knew what really happened , if you knew the truth
i wouldn' t believe you no matter what .
you' d say anything now to get what you want .
you want to feel sorry for yourself ?
with so much at stake , all you can think of is your own feeling .
one woman has hurt you , and you take revenge on the rest of the world .
you' re a coward and a weakling !
no .
richard , i' m sorry .
i' m sorry , but you you are our last hope .
if you don' t help us , victor will die in casablanca .
what of it ?
i' m gonna die in casablanca .
it' s a good spot for it .
now , if you' il
all right .
i tried to reason with you .
i tried everything .
i want those letters .
get them for me .
i don' t have to .
i got them right here .
put them on the table .
no .
for the last time , put them on the table .
if laszlo and the cause mean so much to you , you won' t stop at anything .
all right , i' il make it easier for you .
go ahead and shoot .
you' il be doing me a favor .
i tried to stay away .
i thought i would never see you again .
that you were out of my life .
the day you left paris . . .
. . . if you knew what i went through .
if you knew how much i loved you .
how much i still love you .
and then ?
it wasn' t long after we were married that victor went back to czechoslovakia .
they needed him in prague .
but the gestapo were waiting for him .
victor laszlo apprehended .
sent to concentration camp .
i was frantic .
for months i tried to get word .
then it came .
he was dead .
shot , trying to escape .
i was lonely .
i had nothing , not even hope .
then i met you .
why weren' t you honest ?
why keep your marriage a secret ?
it wasn' t my secret , richard .
victor wanted it that way .
not even our closest friends knew about it .
he was protecting me .
i knew about his work .
if the gestapo found out i was his wife , it' d be dangerous for me . . . . . . and for those working with us .
when did you first find out he was alive ?
just before you and i were to leave paris .
a friend came and told me that victor was alive .
they hid him in a freight car in the outskirts of paris .
he was sick .
he needed me .
i wanted to tell you , but i didn' t dare .
i knew you wouldn' t have left and the gestapo would have caught you , so l . . . .
well , you know the rest .
it' s still a story without an ending .
what about now ?
now ?
i don' t know .
i know i' il never have the strength to leave you again .
and laszlo ?
you' il help him now , won' t you ?
you' il see that he gets out .
then he' il have his work .
all that he' s been living for .
all except one .
he won' t have you .
i can' t fight it anymore .
i ran away from you once .
i can' t do it again .
i don' t know what' s right any longer .
you have to think for both of us .
for all of us .
all right .
i will .
here' s looking at you , kid .
i wish i didn' t love you so much .
i think we lost them .
yes .
they caught some of the others .
come inside .
come , mr. laszlo .
i will help you immediately .
i' il give you some water .
carl , what happened ?
the police break up our meeting .
we escaped in the last moment .
come up here a minute .
yes , i come .
turn out the light at the rear .
it may attract police .
sascha always puts it out .
tonight he forgot .
yes , i come .
i will do it .
take miss lund home .
yes , sir .
just a little cut .
we had to get through a window .
this might come in handy .
thank you .
had a close one ?
yes , rather .
don' t you sometimes wonder if it' s worth all this ?
i mean , what you' re fighting for .
we might as well question why we breathe .
we stop breathing , we' il die .
we stop fighting our enemies , the world will die .
what of it ?
then it' il be out of its misery .
you know how you sound ?
like a man who' s convincing himself of something he doesn' t believe .
each of us has a destiny .
for good or for evil .
i get the point .
i wonder if you do .
i wonder if you know you' re trying to escape from yourself .
you' il never succeed .
you seem to know all about my destiny .
i know a good deal more about you than you suspect .
i know that you' re in love with a woman .
it' s perhaps a strange circumstance . . . . . . that we' re in love with the same woman .
the first evening i came into this caf . . . . . . i knew there was something between you and ilsa .
since no one is to blame . . . . . . i demand no explanation .
i ask only one thing .
you won' t give me the letters . . . . . . all right .
but i want my wife to be safe .
i ask you as a favor . . . . . . to use the letters to take her away from casablanca .
you love her that much ?
apparently , you think of me only as the leader of a cause .
i' m also a human being .
yes , i love her that much .
mr. laszlo ?
yes ?
come with us .
we have a warrant for your arrest .
on what charge ?
the captain will discuss that with you later .
it seems that destiny has taken a hand .
you haven' t any proof .
this isn' t germany or occupied france .
you can fine him and give him 30 days .
you might as well let him go .
i advise you not to be interested in what happens to laszlo .
if you help him to escape
why do you think i' d stick my neck out for him ?
because , one , you bet 10, 000 francs he' d escape .
two , you' ve got the letters .
don' t bother to deny it .
you might do it because you don' t like strasser' s looks .
i don' t like them either .
they' re all excellent reasons .
don' t count too much on my friendship .
in this matter , i' m powerless .
besides , i might lose 10, 000 francs .
you' re not very subtle , but you are effective .
i get the point .
yes , i have the letters .
i intend using them myself .
i' m leaving casablanca on tonight' s plane .
the last plane .
i' m taking a friend with me .
one you' il appreciate .
what friend ?
ilsa lund .
that ought to put your mind to rest about my helping laszlo escape .
the last man i want to see in america .
you didn' t come here to say this .
you have the letters .
fill in your name and hers and leave anytime you please .
why do you still care what happens to laszlo ?
i' m not .
but i am interested in what happens to ilsa and me .
we have a legal right to go , but people have been held here . . . . . . in spite of their legal rights .
why do you think we want to hold you ?
ilsa is laszlo' s wife .
she probably knows things strasser would like to know .
i' il make a deal with you .
instead of this petty charge , you could get something really big . . . . . . that would chuck him in a camp for years .
that' d be a feather in your cap .
it certainly would .
germany vichy would be grateful .
then release him .
be at my place a half hour before the plane leaves .
laszlo will come there to pick up the letters .
that' il give you the grounds to make the arrest .
you get him , and we get away .
to the germans , that last will be just a minor annoyance .
there' s still something i don' t understand .
miss lund , she is very beautiful , yes . . . . . . but you were never interested in any woman .
she isn' t just any woman .
i see .
how do i know you' il keep your bargain ?
i' il make the arrangements with laszlo in the visitor' s pen .
i' m gonna miss you .
you' re the only one here who has even less scruples than l .
thanks .
go ahead , ricky .
call off your watchdogs when you let him go .
i don' t want them around today .
i' m taking no chances , not even with you .
should we draw it up , or is a handshake good enough ?
certainly not good enough .
but since i' m in a hurry , it' il have to do .
ah , to get out of casablanca and go to america !
you' re a lucky man .
my agreement with sam is that he gets 25 % of the profits .
that still goes .
i happen to know he gets 10 % .
but he' s worth 25 .
abdul , carl and sascha stay with the place or i don' t sell .
of course .
rick' s wouldn' t be rick' s without them .
so long .
remember you owe rick' s 100 cartons of cigarettes .
i shall remember to pay it to myself .
you' re late .
i was informed as he left the hotel .
so i' m on time .
i said to tie up your watchdogs .
he won' t be followed .
this place won' t be the same without you .
i' ve already spoken to ferrari .
you' il still win at roulette .
is everything ready ?
i have the letters here .
when we searched the place , where were they ?
sam' s piano .
serves me right for not being musical .
here they are .
you better wait in my office .
victor thinks i' m going with him .
haven' t you told him ?
not yet .
but it' s all right , isn' t it ?
everything' s quite all right .
we' il tell him at the airport .
the less time to think , the easier .
trust me .
yes , i will .
i don' t know how to thank you .
save it .
we still have a lot to do .
i brought the money .
keep it , you' il need it in america .
we made a deal .
never mind that .
you won' t have trouble in lisbon ?
no .
it' s all arranged .
good .
the letters are made out in blank .
all you have to do is fill in the signatures .
victor laszlo . . . . . . you' re under arrest .
for accessory to the murder of the couriers from whom these were stolen .
you' re surprised about ricky ?
the explanation is simple .
love , it seems , has triumphed over virtue .
thank
not so fast , louis .
nobody' s gonna be arrested .
not for a while yet .
have you taken leave of your senses ?
i have .
sit down .
i don' t want to shoot you , but i will if you take one more step .
under the circumstances , i will sit down .
keep your hands down .
i wonder if you realize what this means ?
i do .
we' il discuss that later .
call off the watchdogs , you said .
call the airport .
you tell them .
remember , this gun is pointed right at your heart .
that is my least vulnerable spot .
hello ? ls that the airport ?
capt. renault speaking .
there' il be two letters of transit for lisbon .
there' s to be no trouble about them .
good .
my car , quickly .
this is strasser .
have police meet me at the airport at once .
at once , do you hear ?
hello , radio tower ?
lisbon plane taking off in 10 minutes , east runway .
visibility one and one half miles .
light ground fog .
depth of fog approximately 500 .
ceiling unlimited .
thank you .
have him go with laszlo to take care of his luggage .
certainly , rick , anything you say .
find mr. laszlo' s luggage and put it on the plane .
this way , please .
fill in the names .
that' il make it even more official .
you think of everything , don' t you ?
the names are mr. and mrs. victor laszlo .
but . . . . . . why my name ?
you' re getting on that plane .
but what about you ?
i' m staying here till the plane gets away .
what' s happened to you ?
last night
last night we said a great many things .
you said i was to do the thinking for us .
i' ve done a lot .
you' re getting on that plane with victor where you belong .
now , you' ve got to listen to me .
do you know what you' d have to look forward to here ?
we' d both wind up in a concentration camp .
isn' t that true ?
maj. strasser would insist .
you' re saying this to make me go .
i' m saying it because it' s true .
inside we both know you belong with victor .
you' re part of his work , the thing that keeps him going .
if that plane leaves and you' re not with him , you' il regret it .
maybe not today , not tomorrow , but soon .
for the rest of your life .
but what about us ?
we' il always have paris .
we didn' t have .
we' d lost it until you came to casablanca .
we got it back last night .
when i said i would never leave you .
and you never will .
i' ve got a job to do too .
where i go , you can' t follow .
what i have to do , you can' t be part of .
i' m no good at being noble .
but it doesn' t take much to see that the problems of three people . . . . . . don' t amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world .
someday you' il understand that .
here' s looking at you , kid .
everything is in order .
all except one thing .
there' s something you should know .
i don' t ask you to explain anything .
it may make a difference to you later on .
you said you knew about ilsa and me .
she was at my place last night when you were .
she came there for the letters .
isn' t that true ?
yes .
she tried everything .
nothing worked .
she did her best to convince me that she was still in love with me .
but that was all over long ago .
for your sake , she pretended it wasn' t .
i let her pretend .
i understand .
here it is .
thanks .
i appreciate it .
welcome back to the fight .
this time i know our side will win .
are you ready ?
yes , i' m ready .
goodbye , rick .
god bless you .
better hurry .
you' il miss that plane .
i was right .
you are a sentimentalist .
stay where you are .
i don' t know what you mean .
what you did for laszlo .
and that fairy tale to send ilsa away with him .
i know a little about women .
she went , but she knew you were lying .
anyway , thanks for helping me out .
this isn' t going to be pleasant for either of us .
especially for you .
i' il have to arrest you .
as soon as the plane goes .
what was the meaning of that phone call ?
victor laszlo is on that plane .
why do you stand here ?
why not stop him ?
ask monsieur rick .
get away from that phone .
do not interfere .
i was willing to shoot renault .
i' il shoot you .
put that phone down .
get me the radio tower .
put it down !
maj. strasser has been shot .
round up the usual suspects .
you' re not only a sentimentalist , but you' ve become a patriot .
maybe .
it seemed like a good time to start .
i think perhaps you' re right .
it might be good for you to disappear from casablanca for a while .
there' s a free french garrison at brazzaville .
i could arrange passage .
my letter of transit ?
i could use a trip .
but it doesn' t change our bet .
you still owe me 10, 000 francs .
and that 10, 000 francs should pay our expenses .
our " expenses ?
louis . . . . . . i think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship .
