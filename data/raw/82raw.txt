grandpa !
you' re not supposed to be up here , looking at that .
i just wanted to know .
well , you' re old enough , i suppose .
you should know the story .
ok , here we go .
it was 1832 .
on a night much like this .
yah !
charles carroll was the last surviving signer of the declaration of independence .
he was also a member of a secret society known as the masons .
and he knew he was dying .
he woke up his stable boy in the middle of the night and ordered him to take him to the white house to see andrew jackson . because it was urgent that he speak to the president .
did he talk to himm ?
no .
he never got the chance .
the president wasn' t there that night .
but charles carroll had a secret .
so he took into his confidence the one person he could , my grandfather' s grandfather ,
thomas gates .
what was the secret ?
atreasure .
a treasure beyond all imagining .
a treasure that had been fought over for centuries by tyrants . pharaohs . emperors . warlords .
and every time it changed hands it grew larger .
and then suddenly ... it vanished .
it didn' t reappear for more than a thousand years . when knights from the first crusade discovered secret vaults beneath the temple of solomon .
you see . the knights who found the vaults believed that the treasure was too great for any one man not even a king .
they brought the treasure back to europe and took the name " the knights templar .
over the next century they smuggled it out of europe and they formed a new brotherhood called the freemasons . in honor of the builders of the great temple .
war followed .
by the time of the american revolution the treasure had been hidden again .
by then the masons included
george washington .
benjamin franklin .
paul revere .
they knew they had to make sure the treasure would never fall into the hands of the british .
so they devised a series of clues and maps to its location .
over time the clues were lost or forgotten , until only one remained and that was the secret that charles carroll entrusted to young thomas gates .
charlotte .
the secret lies with charlotte .
who' s charlotte ?
oh ... not even mr. carroll knew that .
now look here , ben .
the freemasons among our founding fathers left us clues .
like these .
the unfinished pyramid .
the all seeing eye .
symbols of the knights templar , guardians of the treasure .
they' re speaking to us through these .
you mean laughing at us .
you know what that dollar represents ?
the entire gates family fortune .
six generations of fools ... chasing after fool' s gold .
it' s not about the money , patrick .
it' s never been about the money .
come on , son .
time to go .
you can ... say your goodbyes .
grandpa ?
hmm ?
arewe knights ?
do you want to be ?
all right .
um ... kneel .
benjamin franklin gates , you take upon yourself the duty of the templars , the freemasons and the family gates .
do you so swear ?
i so swear .
i was thinking about henson and peary , crossing this kind of terrain with nothing more than dog sleds and on foot .
can you imagine ?
it' s extraordinary .
we getting closer ?
assuming ben' s theory' s correct and my tracking model' s accurate , we should be getting very close .
but don' t go by me i broke a shoelace this morning .
it' s ... it' s a bad omen .
shall we turn around and go home ?
or we could pull over and just throw him out here .
ok .
riley , you' re not missing that little windowless cubicle we found you in ?
no , no .
absolutely not .
why are we stopping ?
i thought we were looking for a ship .
i don' t see any ship .
she' s out there .
look ... this is a waste of timme .
how could a ship wind up way out here ?
well , i' m no expert , but ... it could be that the hydrothermic properties of this region produce hurricane force ice stormms that cause the ocean to freeze and then melt and then refreeze , resulting in a semisolid migrating land mass that would land a ship right around here .
hello , beautiful .
have viktor check the fuel in the generators .
two years ago , if you hadn' t shown up , hadn' t believed the treasure was real ,
i don' t know if i ever would have found charlotte .
you would have found it , i have no doubt .
that' s why i didn' t think it was as crazy an investment as everyone said .
i' m just relieved that i' m not as crazy as everyone says .
or said my dad was .
or my granddad .
or my great granddad .
ok !
let' s go !
let' s go find some treasure .
yeah , bring us back something .
urgh .
oh , god !
you handled that well .
this is it .
it' s the cargo hold .
do you think it' s in the barrels ?
gunpowder .
ooh !
ooh !
ok ...
why would the captain be guarding this barrel ?
i found something !
what is it ?
do you guys know what this is ?
is it a billion dollar pipe ?
it' s a meerschaum pipe .
ah , that is beautiful .
look at the intricacy of the scrollwork on the stem .
is it a million dollar pipe ?
no , it' s a clue .
let mme see that .
no , don' t break it !
we are one step closer to the treasure , gentlemen .
ben , i thought you said that the treasure would be on the charlotte .
no , " the secret lies with charlotte .
i said it could be here .
it' s temmplar symmbols .
the legend writ .
the stain effected .
the key in silence undetected .
fifty five in iron pen .
mr. matlack can' t offend .
it' s a riddle .
i need to think .
the legend writ .
the stain effected .
what legend ?
there' s the legend of the templar treasure , and the stain effects the legend .
how ?
the key in silence undetected .
wait .
the legend and the key ...
now there' s something .
a map .
maps have leends , mmaps have keys .
it' s a map , an invisible map .
so now ...
wait a minute .
what do you mean , " invisible " " an invisible map " ?
the stain effected " could refer to a dye or a reagent used to bring about a certain result .
combined with " the key in silence undetected , " the implication is that the effect is to make what was undetectable detectable .
unless ...
the key in silence " could be ...
prison .
albuquerque .
see , i can do it too .
snorkel .
that' s where the map is .
like he said , " fifty five in iron pen .
iron pen " is a prison .
or it could be , since the primary writing medium of the time was iron gall ink , the " pen " is ... just a pen .
but then why not say a pen ?
why ... why say " iron pen " ?
' cause it' s a prison .
wait a minute .
iron pen " the " iron " does not describe the ink in the pen , it describes whatwas penned .
it was " iron " it was firm , it was mineral ...
no , no , no , that' s stupid .
it was ...
it was firm , it was adamant , it was resolved .
it was resolved .
mr. matlack can' t offend .
timothy matlack was the official scribe of the continental congress .
calligrapher , not writer .
and to make sure he could not offend the map , it was put on the back of a resolution that he transcribed , a resolution that 55 men signed .
the declaration of independence .
oh !
come on , there' s no invisible map on the back of the declaration of independence .
that' s clever , really .
a document of that importance would ensure the map' s survival .
and you said there were several masons signed it , yeah ?
yeah .
nine , for sure .
we' il have to arrange a way to examine it .
this is one of the most important documents in history .
they' re not just gonna let us waltz in there and run chemical tests on it .
then what do you propose we do ?
i don' t know !
we could borrow it .
steal it ?
i don' t think so .
ben ... the treasure of the knights templar is the treasure of all treasures .
oh , i didn' t know that .
really ?
look , ben ...
i understand your bitterness .
i really do .
you' ve spent your entire life searching for this treasure , only to have the respected historical community treat you and your family with mockery and contempt .
you should be able to rub this treasure in their arrogant faces , and i want you to have the chance to do that .
how ?
we all have our areas of expertise .
you don' t think mine are limited to writing checks , do you ?
in another life ...
i arranged a number of operations of ... questionable legality .
i' d take his word for it , if i were you .
so don' t worry .
i' il make all the arrangements .
no .
i' d really need your help here .
ian ...
i' m not gonna let you steal the declaration of independence .
ok .
from this point on all you' re going to be is a hindrance .
hey !
what are you gonna do ?
are you gonna shoot me , shaw ?
well , you can' t shoot me .
there' s more to the riddle .
information you don' t have .
i do .
i' m the only one who can figure it out , and you know that .
he' s bluffing .
we played poker together , ian .
you know i can' t bluff .
tell me what i need to know , ben , or i' il shoot your friend .
hey !
quiet , riley !
your job' s finished here .
look where you' re standing .
all that gunpowder .
you shoot me , i drop this , we all go up .
ben ...
what happens when the flare burns down ?
tell me what i need to know , ben .
you need to know ... if shaw can catch .
nice try , though .
get out , shaw !
fool !
riley , get over here !
what is this ?
smuggler' s hold .
get in !
move !
get out of here !
what ?
move !
get out !
follow mme .
let' s go , let' s go !
she' s gonna blow !
get down .
ok , let' s go .
before someone sees the smoke .
there' s an inuit village about nine miles east of here .
it' s popular with bush pilots .
all right .
then what are we gonna do ?
start making our way back home .
no , i meant about ian .
he' s gonna steal the declaration of independence , ben .
we stop him .
is it really so hard to believe that someone' s gonna try to steal the declaration of independence ?
the fbl gets 10, 000 tips a week .
they' re not gonna worry about something they' re sure is safe .
but anyone that can do anything is gonna think we' re crazy .
anyone crazy enough to believe us isn' t gonna want to help .
we don' t need someone crazy .
but one step short of crazy , what do you get ?
obsessed .
passionate .
excuse mme .
dr. chase can see you now , mr. brown .
thank you .
mr. brown ?
the family name doesn' t get a lot of respect in the academic community .
huh .
being kept down by the man .
a very cute man .
thank you .
good afternoon , gentlemen .
hi .
abigail chase .
paul brown .
nice to meet you .
bill .
nice to meet you , bill .
how may i help you ?
your accent .
pennsylvania dutch ?
saxony german .
oh !
you' re not american ?
oh , i am an american .
i just wasn' t born here .
please don' t touch that !
sorry .
a neat collection .
george washington' s campaign buttons .
you' re missing the 1789 inaugural , though .
i found one once .
that' s very fortunate for you .
now , you told my assistant that this was an urgent matter .
ah .
yes , ma' am .
well , i' m gonna get straight to the point .
someone' s gonna steal the declaration of independence .
it' s true .
i think i' d better put you gentlemmen in touch with the fbl .
we' ve been to the fbl .
and ?
they assured us that the declaration cannot possibly be stolen .
they' re right .
my friend and i are less certain .
however , if we were given the privilege of examining the document ... we would be able to tell you for certain if it were actually in any danger .
what do you think you' re gonna find ?
we believe that there' s an ... encryption on the back .
an encryption , like a code ?
yes , ma' am .
of what ?
uh ... a cartograph .
a map .
yes , ma' am .
a map of what ?
the location of ... ... of hidden items of historic and intrinsic value .
a treasure map ?
that' s where we lost the fbl .
you' re treasure hunters , aren' t you ?
we' re more like treasure protectors .
mr. brown , i have personally seen the back of the declaration of independence , and i promise you , the only thing there is a notation that reads ,
original declaration of independence , dated ...
four of july , 1776 . " yes , ma' am .
but no mmap .
it' s invisible .
oh !
right .
and that' s where we lost the department of homeland security .
what led you to assume there' s this invisible map ?
we found an engraving on the stem of a 200 year old pipe .
owned by freemasons .
may i see the pipe ?
uh , we don' t have it .
did big foot take it ?
it was nice meeting you .
nice to meet you , too .
and , you know , that really is a nice collection .
must have taken you a long time to hunt down all that history .
if it' s any consolation , you had me convinced .
it' s not .
i was thinking , what if we go public , plaster the story all over the internet ?
it' s not like we have our reputations to worry about .
although i don' t think that' s exactly gonna scare ian away .
180 years of searching , and i' m three feet away .
of all the ideas that became the united states , there' s a line here that' s at the heart of all the others .
but when a long train of abuses and usurpations , pursuing invariably the samme object , evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism , it is their right , it is their duty to throw off such government and provide new guards for their future security .
people don' t talk that way anymmore .
beautiful , huh ?
no idea what you said .
it means , if there' s something wrong , those who have the ability to take action have the responsibility to take action .
i' m gonna steal it .
what ?
i' m gonna steal the declaration of independence .
uh ...
ben ?
this is ... huge .
it' s prison huge .
you are gonna go to prison , you know that ?
yeah , probably .
so that would bother most people .
ian' s gonna try and steal it .
and if he succeeds , he' il destroy the declaration .
the fact is , the only way to protect the declaration is to steal it .
it' s upside down .
i don' t think there' s a choice .
ben , for god' s sakes , it' s like stealing a national monument .
ok ?
it' s like stealing him .
it can' t be done .
not shouldn' t be done .
it can' t be done .
let mme prove it to you .
ok , ben , pay attention .
i' ve brought you to the library of congress .
why ?
because it' s the biggest library in the world .
over 20 million books .
listen to riley .
what we have here , my friend , is an entire layout of the archives .
short of builders ' blueprints .
you' ve got construction orders , phone lines , water and sewage it' s all here .
now , when the declaration is on display , ok , it is surrounded by guards and video monitors and a little family from iowa and little kids on their eighth grade field trip .
and beneath an inch of bulletproof glass is an army of sensors and heat monitors that will go off if someone gets too close with a high fever .
now , when it' s not on display , it is lowered into a four foot thick concrete , steel plated vault ... that happens to be equipped with an electronic combination lock and biometric access denial systems .
you know , thomas edison tried and failed nearly 2, 000 times to develop the carbonized cotton thread filament for the incandescent light bulb .
edison ?
when asked about it , he said , " i didn' t fail ,
i found out 2, 000 ways how not to make a light bulb .
but he only needed to find one way to make it work .
the preservation room .
enjoy .
go ahead .
do you know what the preservation room is for ?
delicious jams and jellies ?
no .
that' s where they clean , repair and maintain all the documents and the storage housings when they' re not on display or in the vault .
now , when the case needs work they take it out of the vault , directly across the hall and into the preservation room .
the best time for us . or ian . to steal it would be during the gala this weekend when the guards are distracted by the vlps upstairs .
but we' il make our way to the preservation room , where there' s much less security .
huh .
well , if ian ...
uh ...
preservation ...
hmm .
the gala , huh ?
this might be possible .
it might .
ah ...
andwearein .
there you are .
hello .
the hallway .
that' s what i want .
game on .
i' il buy that .
cool .
this just came for you .
i hope it' s not fromm stan .
for the woman who has everything else ...
thanks for listening .
paul brown .
abigail chase
hey , mike .
let' s do this by the book .
hallway is secure .
keep the document level .
no problem .
what have you got ?
the heat sensor went off in the declaration frame .
run full diagnostics . then i want them all changed out .
our evil plan is working .
ben , are you sure that we should ... ?
riley .
can you hear me ?
unfortunately . yeah .
we' re all set in here .
you want to go around to the front and present your invitation .
you' re gonna have to show id .
go ahead , man .
howdy .
i need your invitation and your id , please .
how do you look ?
not bad .
mazel tov .
this is it .
for you .
oh , mr. brown .
dr. chase .
what are you doing here ?
is that that hot girl ?
how does she look ?
i made a last minute donation .
a big one .
well , on that subject , thank you for your wonderful gift .
oh , you did get it ?
good .
yes , thank you .
you know , i really couldn' t accept something like that normally , but ...
i really want it .
well , you needed it .
come on .
romeo . get outta there .
i have been wondering , though , what the engraving indicated
on the pipe that big foot took .
hi .
here you go .
oh , dr. herbert , this is mr. brown .
hi .
hi there .
who' s the stiff ?
here , why don' t you let me take that ?
so you can take that off his hands .
thank you .
a toast , yeah ?
to high treason .
that' s what these men were committing when they signed the declaration .
had we lost the war , they would have been hanged , beheaded , drawn and quartered , and oh !
oh , my personal favorite and had their entrails cut out and burned !
so , here' s to the men who did what was considered wrong in order to do what they knew was right .
what they knew was right .
well , good night .
good night .
good night .
yeah !
ok , go !
go !
this better work .

andjustwho mightyou be ?
once we catch them what do we do ?
i' m working on it .
right turn , right turn .
why don' t you just pass me that document ?
then we can all go home .
oh , no .
skidding , skidding , skidding .
oh , no !
holy lord !
help !
no !
if she falls , the document falls .
get me next to her .
thank you .
no !

go on .
abigail !
come on .
jump .
we lost them .
that' s all right .
this ... is what we need .
well done , gates .
well done .
are you all right ?
no !
those lunatics ...
you' re not hurt , are you ?
you are all lunatics !
are you hungry ?
what ? !
are you all right ?
still a little on edge from being shot at , but i' il be ok .
thanks for asking .
yeah , well , i' m not all right .
those men have the declaration of independence !
she lost it ? !
they don' t have it .
see ?
ok ?
now could you please stop shouting ?
give me that !
you' re still shouting .
it' s starting to annoy .
you' d do well , dr. chase , to be a bit more civilized in this instance .
if this is the real one , what did they get ?
asouvenir .
i thought it' d be a good idea to have a duplicate .
it turned out i was right .
i actually had to pay for the souvenir and the real one , so you owe me $35 , plus tax .
genius .
who were those men ?
just the guys we warned you were gonna steal the declaration .
and you didn' t believe us .
we did the only thing we could do to keep it safe .
verdammt !
give me that !
you know something ?
you' re shouting again .
i' mm pretty sure she was swearing , too .
well , we probably deserve that .
ladies and gentlemen ...
ladies and gentlemen , my name is peter sadusky .
i' m the agent in charge .
i wanna reassure you , you are not in danger in any way .
if we all cooperate , we' il get through this with as little frustration as possible .
thank you .
get positive ids .
search everyone , including the security staff .
if they refuse , detain them and get warrants .
agent hendricks ?
you have something ?
um ...
this isn' t a day for " um ... " we got a tip several days ago that someone was going to steal the declaration of independence .
do we have a namme on the tipster ?
there was no file opened .
we didn' t find the information credible .
how about now ?
there is not a treasure map on the back of the declaration of independence .
and there' s no chance anyone can steal this either .
i leveled with you 100 percent .
everything i told you was the truth .
i want that document , mr. brown .
ok , my name' s not brown .
it' s gates .
i leveled with you 98 percent .
wait a minute , did you just say " gates " ?
gates ?
you' re that family with the conspiracy theory about the founding fathers ?
it' s not a conspiracy theory .
per se .
you know what ?
i take it back .
you' re not liars .
you' re insane .
there' s a copy of the declaration on display now ?
yes , we decided to ...
leave it there .
the guests know something happened , but they don' t know what .
they got him with a taser at the service entrance .
he doesn' t remember a thing .
also, wefound bulletcasings
did we get a description from the other guards ?
which guards ?
the guards that were fired upon .
there weren' t any other guards on patrol down here .
so ... who was shooting , who were they shooting at , and why weren' t they getting along ?
you can' t seriously intend to run chemical tests on the declaration of independence in the back of a moving van .
we have a clean room environment all set up .
eds suits , a particulate air filtration system , the whole shebang .
really ?
we can' t go back there .
what ?
why not ?
this is the guy .
dr. herbert said dr. chase introduced him as mr. brown .
not on the guestlist .
now , the gift store clerk she said he seemed ...
well , she said " flustered .
he tried to walk out with a copy of the declaration of independence without paying .
he paid with a visa .
charge to benjamin gates .
a credit card slip ?
dude , we' re on the grid .
they' il have your records from forever .
they' il have my records from forever .
i know .
i know .
it' s only a matter of minutes before the fbl shows up at my front door .
what do we do ?
we need those letters .
what letters ?
you know , get off the road , take a right .
what letters ?
you have the original silence dogood letters ?
did you steal those , too ?
we have scans of the originals .
quiet , please .
how' d you get scans ?
oh , i know the person who has the originals .
now shush .
why do you need them ?
she really can' t shut her mouth , can she ?
i' il tell you what , look .
i will let you hold onto this if you' il promise to shut up , please .
thank you .
ben , you know what you have to do .
i know what to do .
i' m just trying to think of anything else we could do .
well , not to be a , uh , nudge , but you do realize how many people we have after us .
we probably have our own satellite by now .
it took you all of two seconds to decide to steal the declaration of independence .
yeah , but i didn' t think i was gonna personally have to tell my dad about it .
hey , not cool !
not cool !
let me go !
ok .
you' re let go .
go , shoo .
i' m not going .
not without the declaration .
you' re not going with the declaration .
yes , i am .
i' m not letting it out of my sight , so i' m going .
wait .
you' re not going with us with the declaration .
yes , i am .
no , you' re not .
look , if you wanted to leave me behind , you shouldn' t have told me where you were going .
clear .
what the ...
now we' re getting somewhere .
they' re digital scans of letters to the editor of the new england courant .
written 1722 .
they' re all from the same person .
your humble servant , silence dogood .
gentlemen ... why is this word capitalized ?
because it' s immportant ?
because it' s a namme .
ok , i got it .
when ben franklin was only 15 years old he secretly wrote 14 letters to his brother' s newspaper pretending to be a middle aged widow named silence dogood .
these letters were written by benjamin franklin .
looks ok .
park a couple of blocks away .
well , how long do you think we got ?
i' m gonna give them a couple of hours at least .
i hope .
what do we do about her ?
i' ve got some duct tape in the back .
no , that won' t be necessary .
she won' t be any trouble .
promise you won' t be any trouble .
i promise .
see ?
she' s curious .
here' s what i got on gates .
a degree in american history from georgetown , a degree in mechanical engineering at mlt ,
navy rotc and naval diving and salvage training center .
hmm .
what in the world did this guy want to be when he grew up ?
we keep our focus on gates .
run him to ground .
compile a family and friends list .
closest relative first .
i want to find out who this guy is .
dad .
where' s the party ?
uh , well , uh ...
i' mm in a little trouble .
is she pregnant ?
well , if she is , are you gonna leave the woman carrying your grandchild standing out in the cold ?
i look pregnant ?
this better not be about that dumb treasure .
well , have a seat .
make yourselves comfortable .
there' s some pizza .
it' s still warm , i think .
dad ...
i need the silence dogood letters .
yeah , it' s about the treasure .
and he dragged you two into this nonsense ?
literally .
i volunteered .
well , unvolunteer , before you waste your life .
knock it off , dad .
sure , sure , i know , i' m the family kook .
i have a job , a house , health insurance .
at least i had your mother , for however brief a time .
at least i had you .
what do you have ?
him ?
look , if you just give us the letters , we' re gone .
you disappoint me , ben .
well , maybe that' s the real gates family legacy .
sons who disappoint their fathers .
get out .
take your troubles with you .
i found the charlotte .
the charlotte ?
you mean she was a ship ?
yeah , she was beautiful .
it was amazing , dad .
andthetreasure ?
no , no .
but we found another clue that led us here .
yeah , and that' il lead you to another clue .
and that' s all you' il ever find , is another clue .
don' t you get it , ben ?
i finally figured it out .
the legend says that the treasure was buried to keep it from the british .
but what really happened was the legend was invented , to keep the british occupied searching for buried treasure .
the treasure is a myth .
i refuse to believe that .
well , you can believe what you want .
you' re a grown person .
what am i doing ?
do what you want , ben .
do what you want .
he' s probably right .
you don' t even know if there is another clue .
well , i can think of a way where we could find out .
and we can find out right now .
looks like animmal skin .
how old is it ?
at least 200 years .
really ?
you sure ?
pretty darn .
now if this thing' s in invisible ink , how do we look at it ?
throw it in the oven .
no .
uh uh .
ferrous sulfate inks can only be brought out with heat .
yes , but this ...
it' s very old .
this is very old , and we can' t risk compromising the map .
you need a reagent .
dad , it' s really late .
why don' t you get some rest ?
i' mm fine .
lemmons .
you can' t do that .
but it has to be done .
then someone who is trained to handle antique documents is gonna do it .
ok .
ok .
now , uh , if there is a secret message , it' il probably be mmarked by a symmbol in the upper right hand corner .
that' s right .
i am so getting fired for this .
i told you .
you need heat .
see ?
we need more juice .
we need more heat .
that' s not a mmap .
is it ?
more clues .
what a surprise .
are those latitudes and longitudes ?
that' s why we need the silence dogood letters .
that' s the key ?
yeah .
the key in silence undetected .
dad , can we have the letters now ?
will somebody please explain to me what these magic numbers are ?
it' s an ottendorf cipher .
that' s right .
oh , ok .
what' s an ottendorf cipher ?
they' re just codes .
each of these three numbers corresponds to a word in a key .
usually a random book or a newspaper article .
in this case , the silence dogood letters .
so it' s like the page number of the key text , the line on the page , and the letter in that line .
so , dad , where are the letters ?
you know , it' s just by sheer happenstance that his grandfather ...
dad . ... even found them .
they were in an antique desk from the press room ...
dad . ... of the new england courant .
that' s a newspaper .
dad , where are the letters ?
i don' t have them , son .
what ?
i don' t have them .
where are they ?
i donated themm to the franklin institute in philadelphia .
time to go .
i still can' t believe it .
all this timme no one knewwhat was on the back .
the back of what ?
whoa !
no !
oh , my god .
oh , my god .
i know .
oh , my god .
what have you done ?
this is ... this is the ...
i know !
this is the declaration of independence .
yes .
and it' s very delicate .
you stole it ?
dad , i can explain , but i don' t have time .
it was necessary .
and you saw the cipher .
and that will lead to another clue , and that will lead to another clue !
there is no treasure .
i wasted 20 years of my life .
and now you' ve destroyed yours .
and you pulled me into all this .
well , we can' t have that .
come in !
i' mm in here .
fbl , right ?
you gonna untie me ?
and you have no idea where he' s going ?
well , wouldn' t i have told you if i did ?
would you ?
he tied mme to a chair .
the garage is empty , but there' s a cadillac deville registered to patrick gates .
and he stole my car .
don' t worry , mr. gates , we' il find your car .
and your son .
your dad' s got a sweet ride .
i think we should change clothes .
we look kind of conspicuous , don' t you think ?
i' d love to go shopping , too , but we have no money .
here , i took this from his house .
he usually tucks a few hundred dollars somewhere between those pages .
common sense .
how appropriate .
when are we gonna get there ?
i' m hungry .
this car smells weird .
excuse mme .
excuse mme .
oops , sorry , sir .
excuse mme .
that' s ok .
s s a n d.
ok .
huh .
you' re sure this is right ?
ok .
s s a ...
no , n.
that is an n.
it doesn' t look like an n.
you know what ?
here .
last one .
ok ?
one more dollar .
thank you .
go get the last four letters .
go get ' em , chief .
come on .
ok .
the vision to see the treasured past comes as the timely shadow crosses in front of the house of pass and ...
pass and ... " what ?
pass and ...
what' s going on ?
i' m not sure .
what' s up ?
so you show up at your father' s door and say you' re in trouble and the first thing he assumes is i' m pregnant .
is there a question in there ?
i think there' s an interesting story in there .
well , my father thinks i' ve been a little too cavalier in my personal life .
i see .
let me ask you something .
have you ever told someone not a relative " i love you ?
yes .
more than one sommeone ?
yes .
oh .
well , then my father would say you' ve been a little too cavalier in your personal life , too .
so you get your sense of absolute certainty from him , do you ?
well , i' m sure i don' t know what you mean .
well , you' re certain the treasure is real , despite what anyone else thinks .
no , but i hope it' s real .
i mean , i' ve dreamt it' s real since my grandfather told me about it .
no , no .
but we found another clue that led us here .
yeah , and that' il lead you to another clue .
and that' s all you' il ever find , is another clue .
