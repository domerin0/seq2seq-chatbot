i spent a fortune on this cover .
something you' d better understand , amigo .
loyalty is more important to me than money .

hey , leiter .
where you been ?
it' s bond .
get an ambulance here , quick !
hi , sharky .
you stick around .
i might have some more questions for you , ok ?
how is he ?
his left leg' s gone below the knee .
they might be able to save his arm .
you can bet it was a chain saw .
colombians use them on informers .
hell , they sell more here than in the state of oregon .
i wish i could be more hopeful , but we' il have to wait and see .
chain saw , my ass .
i know a shark bite when i see one .
sanchez has vanished .
he' s got all of leiter' s files .
god only knows what' s in them .
well , find him .
he' s out of our jurisdiction .
there' s plenty of countries that would protect him .
we can' t even get an extradition .
there are other ways .
let it go , commander .
you' re gonna do nothing ?
you' re just gonna forget all about it ?
no , i' m not gonna forget about it .
looks like sanchez ' law operates north of the border , too .
let' s go shark hunting .
this is the last place in the keys .
we' il have to try miami next .
stay here .
you stay out of sight .
i' il handle this .
we' re closed .
ain' t nobody here .
look , i' ve come all the way from london to see you .
universal exports .
we' ve been retained ... .. to arrange shipment of a carcharodon carcharias .
a what ?
great white shark .
it' s all right , bill .
let him in .
unfortunately , we sold all our sharks years ago .
as you can see , we do purely research now .
it' s a project to feed the third world .
we feed maggot to our special breed of genetically engineered fish .
use hormones to make them all male gain weight faster .
from your shark hunting days ?
uh , yeah .
actually , it' s for sale .
look , i' m kinda busy .
maybe some other time .
thank you .
i' il look forward to seeing you again .
goodbye , mr , er ...
goodbye .
mr krest said to be ready .
he' il send the sub back in three hours to pick you up .
can' t wait .
this dump gives me the creeps .
james .
hold it ... right there .
do you mind if i get my hands out of here ?
yeah .
do it slowly .
bon apptit .
freeze !
over by the trap door , old buddy .
is this where you put your old buddy felix ?
not me .
chalk that one up to sanchez and krest .
whoa !
whoa !
there' s two million dollars in that suitcase .
i' il split it with you .
you earned it .
you keep it ... old buddy .
aagh !
god , what a terrible waste .
of money .
hey , sharky !
any news on the wavekrest ?
she' s a big marine research vessel , ... .. owned by a milton krest .
they' re collecting specimens off the cay sel bank .
how long will it take us to get there ?
maybe about six hours .
i' ve a few things to pick up .
be ready in an hour .
hey , commander .
you got a minute ?
local cops got a tip about a warehouse last night .
turned up 500 keys of colombian pure , a couple of stiffs , ... .. and a little bitty piece of what used to be killifer .
good .
at least someone' s on the case .
you may be a pal of leiter' s , but i can only cover up so much .
the dea is screaming to know what happened .
you know , we , we got laws in this country , too .
do you have a law against what they did to leiter ?
look , you' re in over your head .
this is where it ends , commander .
you were supposed to be in istanbul last night .
i' m afraid this unfortunate leiter business has ... clouded your judgment .
you have a job to do .
i expect you on a plane this afternoon .
i haven' t finished here , sir .
leave it to the americans .
it' s their mess .
let them clear it up .
sir , they' re not going to do anything .
i owe it to leiter .
he' s put his life on the line for me many times .
oh , spare me this sentimental rubbish !
he knew the risks .
and his wife ?
this private vendetta of yours ... .. could easily compromise her majesty' s government .
you have an assignment .
i expect you to carry it out objectively and professionally .
then you have my resignation , sir .
we' re not a country club , 007 .
effective immediately ... your licence to kill is revoked , ... .. and i require you to hand over your weapon .
now .
i need hardly remind you that you' re still bound by the official secrets act .
well , i guess it' s , er ... .. a farewell to arms .
don' t !
too many people !
god help you , commander .
something in sector c.
you caused us all a lot of trouble , young lady .
you' re borracho .
go to bed .
when sanchez heard you ran away , ...
.. he went nuts .
it' s none of your business .
it' s my business when your stupid little tricks get sanchez arrested ... .. and i gotta put my organisation at risk to get him out .
the dea just raided key west .
you cost me a lot of dough .
he' il give you the money .
uh uh .
he doesn' t work that way .
you' d better watch yourself , girlie .
i' ve known him a long time .
i' ve seen a lot of girls like you come ... and go .
you' re drunk .
get out .
and stop peeking through my windows .
come on .
what are you so stuck up for ?
he fixed that phoney beauty contest you won .
hey ...
mr krest .
yeah .
what ?
the sentinel' s picking up something large on the monitor .
you' d better take a look .
i don' t believe this .
what the hell is it now ?
it' s just a manta ray .
get the probe back in .
we' il start loading now .
yes , sir .
he said " you' re ok .
take care of him .
make a sound and you' re dead .
you ...
what are you doing in here ?
krest gave me his cabin .
he' s next door .
where' s sanchez ?
he' s not on board .
i don' t know where he is .
you' re his girlfriend .
he doesn' t tell me anything .
open up .
i need to talk to you .

just a moment .
what do you want ?
somebody slipped aboard .
did you ...
.. see anybody ?
no , i was sleeping .

mr krest .
they' re back .

who whipped you ?
sanchez ?
it was my fault .
i did something wrong , made him angry .
nice work , clive .
thanks , mr krest .
guess what ?
his name was sharky .
get rid of the boat .
we' ve got work to do .
you' d better find yourself a new lover .
don' t you men know any other way ?
it' s sanchez ' way .
you seem to like it .
you know nothing .
please go .
if they find you here , we' il both be killed .

probably waiting to see who showed up .
would you like anything to drink ?
bud with a lime .
