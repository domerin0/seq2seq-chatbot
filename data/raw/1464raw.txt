hey .
hey , hey .
come here .
take a look at this .
what ?
what is it ?
it' s a data stream from ps12 .
where is she ?
right above sector 14 .
there isn' t anything in sector 14 .
there is now .
hello ?
miss woods .
pleasure to speak to you .
who is this ?
my name' s maxwell stafford .
i represent weyland industries .
let me guess .
he' s suing us again ?
you misunderstand .
mr. weyland has offered to fund your foundation for a year , if you' il meet with him .
when ?
tomorrow .
tomorrow' s gonna be a problem .
take me a week to get back to the world .
yes , i told mr. weyland that .
he said he didn' t have a week .
we must be right on top of it .
what is it , sebastian ?
the burial chamber is here .
i know it .
we are gonna find it .
i know it too , but without a crew and a permit we' re out of business .
hold the team together for two days .
i' il go to mexico city and i' il talk to the bank .
i' il get us more money .
i might be able to help you accomplish that , professor .
do i know you ?
in exchange for a little of your time .
oh , i' m sorry .
i should' ve switched the flash off .
there' s your magazine .
excuse me .
that' s ok .
i' m documenting the trip for my boys .
this is them .
jacob and scotty .
would you mind taking a picture ?
thank you .
just wanna show them that their dad wasn' t always so boring .
smile .
ok .
there you go .
thank you .
i' m graeme miller .
i' m a chemical engineer .
alexa woods , environmental technician and guide .
do you work for weyland ?
oh , no .
no , i split my time between working for a small environmental group and taking scientists on expeditions on the ice .
lex .
buckle up .
we' re gonna hit some turbulence .
thanks , jack .
is he a friend of yours ?
of my dad' s .
he trained most of the pilots here .
just passed the psr .
oh , damn .
i wish i' d got a picture .
of what ?
the psr .
i wish he' d called it out before we passed it .
the psr is the point of safe return .
it means we' ve used up half our fuel , so we can' t turn back .
right , but if something went wrong , we could land , presumably .
we could ditch .
yeah .
ditch .
but the temperature of the water would kill us in three minutes .
welcome aboard , everybody .
please .
some of you may be wondering why this team has been assembled .
your host will give you the answer now .
mr. weyland .
seven days ago , one of my satellites over antarctica hunting for mineral deposits discovered a sudden heat bloom beneath the earth , which outlined this .
the red lines indicate solid walls .
through thermal mapping , we' ve generated a three dimensional image of the structure .
it' s massive , containing hundreds of rooms , all built around a central core .
my experts tell me it' s a pyramid .
what they can' t agree on is who built it and when .
one expert tells me this has features reminiscent of the aztecs .
another tells me it' s probably cambodian .
what they all agree on is that the smooth side is definitively egyptian .
i think your experts are right .
which one ?
all of them .
meaning what , exactly ?
this pyramid contains the features of all three cultures .
this might be the first pyramid ever built .
but built by whom ?
by the first civilization .
thank you .
but how could anyone possibly build a pyramid out here ?
ancient maps show antarctica free of ice .
it' s likely the continent was once habitable .
i can' t tell you who built it .
but if i could take a sample from it , i can tell you how old it is .
dr. miller , i' m offering to put you right next to this thing .
what caused the heat bloom ?
i don' t know .
where exactly on the ice is this ?
bouvetoya island .
but it' s not on the ice .
it' s 2, 000ft below it .
mr. quinn ?
mr. stafford .
you' re looking at the best drilling team in the world .
we' il chew to that depth in seven days .
add three weeks on top of that to train everyone here .
we don' t have that kind of time , ms. woods .
i' m not the only one with a satellite over antarctica .
others will be here soon .
maybe i wasn' t clear .
no one in this room is ready for this trip .
that' s why i asked you here .
bouvetoya is one of the world' s most isolated places .
the nearest land is 1, 000 miles away .
there' s no help if we run into trouble .
you' re right .
it' s a no man' s land .
but the train has left the station .
and i think i speak for everyone aboard this ship .
this is worth the risk .
find another guide .
i' ve spoken with mr. weyland .
money' s been wired to your account .
chopper' s refueling to fly you home .
who' d you get ?
gerald murdoch .
come in .
murdoch has two seasons of ice time .
he' s not ready .
don' t worry about it .
what about paul woodman ?
we called him .
he gave the same bullshit answer you did .
bullshit " ?
what i told you in there wasn' t bullshit .
if you rush this , people will get hurt .
maybe die .
i don' t understand .
we' re not asking you to take us up everest .
we need you to take us from the ship to the pyramid , and back .
that' s it .
what about inside the pyramid ?
don' t worry about that .
once we' re on the site , we have the best technology and experts that money can buy .
is this new ?
it' s the latest .
mr. weyland , when i lead my team i don' t ever leave my team .
i admire your passion .
i wish you were going with us .
you' re making a mistake .
it' s in the upper atmosphere .
streams of protons and electrons from the sun being deflected by the earth' s magnetic field , causing a solar radiation storm .
shackleton called antarctica " the last greatjourney left to man " .
it' s the one place left in the world that no one owns .
it' s completely free .
me , i' m sort of partial to the penguins .
i wish you' d reconsider coming with us , lex .
come on , don' t make me pull out pictures of my kids again .
your kids aren' t that cute .
what if we got pictures of other people' s kids ?
want my advice ?
stay on the boat .
ok .
let me ask you something .
do we stand a better chance of surviving with you or with the number two choice ?
miss woods , your helicopter' s refueled .
they' re waiting for you .
everybody , listen up !
gather round .
told you she' d stay .
she can' t resist my animal magnetism .
laugh it up , miller .
laugh it up .
gentlemen ?
it is my job to keep you alive on this expedition , and i need your help to do that .
since i don' t have time to properly train you , i' m laying down three rules .
one .
no one goes anywhere alone , ever .
two .
everyone must maintain constant communication .
three .
unexpected things are gonna happen .
when they do , no one tries to be a hero .
understood ?
understood ?
yes , ma' am .
good .
seven seasons on the ice and i' ve never seen a gun save someone' s life .
i don' t plan on using it .
then why bring it ?
same principle as a condom .
i' d rather have one and not need it than need it and not have one .
i' m glad that you decided to stay .
move the trucks out on the ice .
move that .
ok , let' s move .
what' s with the bottle cap ?
what ?
what' s with the bottle cap ?
this is a valuable archaeological find .
when i was a kid growing up in italy , you know what they call a moon that big ?
la luna del cacciatore .
brava .
what' s that ?
hunter' s moon .
hunter' s moon .
hold it , guys .
keep those engines running !
set it down .
move over a little further .
connors .
it' s an abandoned whaling station .
according to your satellite imagery , the pyramid is located directly beneath it .
all right , bring it up .
come on .
spread out .
we' il use this place as a base camp .
mr. quinn , begin drilling operations as soon as you can .
i' m on it .
ok , guys , let' s move out .
what are these ?
whale bones .
this station was abandoned in 1904 .
everyone just disappeared overnight .
it was a big mystery back then .
one for national geographic .
lex .
no one goes anywhere alone .
there' s something there .
listen .
listen .
careful .
they bite .
over here .
over here .
what is it ?
can you believe that ?
it' s drilled at a perfect 30 degree angle .
how far does it go down ?
all the way to the pyramid .
there it is .
clear as day .
and the same time yesterday ...
nothing .
how was it done ?
thermal equipment of some kind .
like yours ?
more advanced .
incredibly powerful .
i' ve never seen anything like it .
there' s no team and no machine in the world that could cut to this depth in 24 hours .
well , the only way we' re gonna know for sure is to get down there and find out .
look at that .
change it .
now !
ok , guys , what' s taking so long ?
there' s a storm coming .
there' s no room for sick men on this expedition .
my doctors tell me the worst is behind me .
you' re not a very good liar , mr. weyland .
stay on the ship .
we' il update you at the top of every hour .
when you get sick , you think about your life and how you' re gonna be remembered .
you know what will happen when i go ?
ten per cent fall in share prices .
maybe 12 .
that' s it .
i' ve heard this speech before .
my dad broke his leg 700ft from the summit of mount rainier .
he was like you .
he wouldn' t go back or let us stop .
we reached the top , and he opened a bottle of champagne .
i had my first drink with my dad at 14, 400ft .
on the way down , he developed a blood clot in his leg that traveled to his lung .
he suffered for four hours before dying 20 minutes from the base .
you think that' s the last thing your dad remembers ?
the pain ?
or drinking champagne with his daughter 14, 000ft in the air ?
i need this .
come on , move .
shit .
mr. weyland !
man down !
get him !
somebody get him !
move it !
now !
i don' t understand it .
no equipment .
no sign of another team .
well , that tunnel didn' t dig itself .
move it .
connors , get those lights up .
we have power .
congratulations , mr. weyland .
looks like you' il be leaving your mark after all .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you all for this .
let' s make history .
thomas .
what is it ?
i recognize the egyptian ...
the second symbol is aztec .
pre conquest era .
the third is cambodian .
then you were right .
the pyramid contains all three cultures .
that' s what it looks like .
" you may choose to enter .
those who choose may enter .
who taught you to translate ?
funny .
kinda looked like you .
well , it' s not " choose " .
it' s " chosen " .
only the chosen ones may enter .
quinn , is that you out there ?
mikkel .
what is all this ?
this is the sacrificial chamber .
like the aztecs and the egyptians .
whoever built this pyramid believed in ritual sacrifice .
this is where the chosen ones were offered to the gods .
those that were chosen would lie here .
they weren' t bound or tied in any way .
they went to die willingly .
men and women .
it was considered an honor .
lucky them .
they gave their lives so the hunt could begin .
what happened here ?
it' s common in ritual sacrifice to take the heart of the victim .
that' s nice .
but that' s not where your heart is .
besides , it looks like the bones were bent straight out .
something broke out of this body .
what have you found , max ?
it' s a shaft to another level .
looks like there' s another room down there .
let' s move to that lower room .
we' re moving on , everyone .
ms. woods .
you , stay here .
rousseau , you stay with him .
keep a team with you .
catalogue everything .
professor .
this should be directly below the sacrificial chamber .
sebastian .
it' s a sarcophagus .
this is the long count .
this is the aztec calendar .
and this , it' s some kind of combination lock .
days .
months .
years .
the dials are set for ...
1904 .
someone opened this 100 years ago ?
what' s today' s date ?
october 10 .
10/ 10/ 2004 .
are you sure this is gonna work ?
i don' t know .
back up !
oh , my god .
take a look at this .
any idea what these are ?
no .
you ?
no .
it' s a good thing we brought the experts .
well , yeah .
it is a good thing .
' cause this is like finding moses ' dvd collection .
weyland ?
a little too much excitement .
we' ve been out long enough for today .
we' il set up base camp at the whaling station and get back at it tomorrow morning .
well , you can go back to the base camp , ms. woods , but we' re staying here .
no .
you wanted to leave without proper prep .
we did .
you wanted to be the first here .
we are .
you' ve claimed the find .
it' s yours .
now , we move as a team , and we' re done for the day .
you heard her .
what do you wanna do with these ?
take them .
we' il run further tests on the surface .
no .
no !
don' t touch them .
watch out !
the doors !
the door !
you ok ?
yeah .
slab' s gotta weigh two tons .
we' il never move it .
what did you say this room was called ?
sacrificial chamber .
rousseau .
tommy , come in .
come in , rousseau .
come in .
is there anything you didn' t tell me ?
nothing .
your guess is as good as mine .
whatever it is , we' re not prepared .
we' re gonna round up the rest of the team and get to the surface .
let' s move !
what are you doing ?
my job .
yours is over .
my job is over when everyone is back on the boat safely .
and that gun doesn' t change anything .
this bearing should take us back to the entrance .
we' il regroup at the whaling station .
what about thomas ?
rousseau ?
we' il find them on the way up .
max ?
stone , verheiden .
cover our backs .
the heat bloom your satellite detected makes more sense now .
what do you mean ?
a building this sophisticated requires an energy source .
i think that' s what your satellite detected .
a power plant for this pyramid firing up .
preparing .
preparing ?
for what ?
gentlemen ?
keep close .
recognize what' s on their shoulders ?
yeah .
we worshipped these things ?
according to this , we did .
and the artifacts you removed from the sarcophagus seem to be their weapons .
let' s keep moving .
only another 200 yards to the entrance .
take cover .
where' s stone ?
stone !
the pyramid' s shifting again .
the doors are closing .
get out .
come on .
ok .
let' s go .
let' s go .
let' s go .
hey !
verheiden !
verheiden !
verheiden !
somebody !
run !
let' s go !
no !
quickly !
no !
no !
hey !
can you hear me ?
it' s connors !
where are you ?
we' re never getting out of this place .
have you got any children ?
got a son .
yeah , i' ve got two .
that means that we do not have the luxury of quitting .
we' re gonna make it outta here .
we' re surviving this if i have to carry you the whole way .
there' s no way out back there .
what' s that ?
just a theory .
the aztec calendar was metric .
based on multiples of ten .
i' m guessing the pyramid reconfigures every ten minutes .
