charles , isn' t this great ?
yeah .
good afternoon .
hi .
man, what wouldn' t i do to get my hands on her ?
get your hands on who ?
the challenger $20 million airplane .
what did you think i meant ?
come along , charles .
charles, you coming ?
yeah .
i' m supposed to give you this .
ok .
charles morse the billionaire ?
my god , is thatwho you are ?
yeah .
stuff everything into the back .
i' ve taken the liberty of talking to the pilot .
i' ve checked the engine log .
the plane' s in good shape .
good avionics .
the fella' s been around .
try not to fly under any low ceiling , any possibility of bird strike , or ice .
what' s bird strike ?
flocks of migrating birds .
if we hit them, we' re all dead .
absolutely .
especially this time of year .
any questions , i' il have a chopper here and fly you out .
we' il be fine .
i said you' d have a good time .
yeah .
when will you require your plane ?
bob ?
they want the film in 34 hours .
i' d say 8 : 00 tomorrow night .
eight o' clock tomorrow night .
yes , sir .
thank you .
oh , no !
you can' t handle this northern weather ?
i' il be all right .
it' s your own fault .
hey , is that a new watch ?
yeah .
dual time zone .
tells the time in two places .
what for ?
if i want to know the time in new york ,
i don' t have to add three .
look there .
right there .
so you built this place with your own hands ?
yes , ma' am .
been building it all my life .
ok , right this way, folks .
you don' t have to worry about keys ' cause we got no locks .
kitchen is always open .
you can fix whatever you like .
the bedrooms and outhouses are upstairs .
we want you to relax , kick off your shoes , and just get down home comfortable .
hey , stephen .
yeah ?
this is what i' m talking about .
see ?
that' s what i want for tomorrow : an unsentimental photograph .
to get a truly unselfconscious photograph , you almost have to go back to the 19th century .
how old is that ?
took it last fall .
that' s jack hawk , a friend of mine .
you took the photo ?
i took the photo .
he took the bear .
i' d be out hunting with him right now if you weren' t here ... and i had my rifle sighted in .
you interested in books ?
yeah .
why can' t you get your rifle sighted in ?
what ?
why can' t you get your rifle sighted in ?
need to rig up a bench rest .
an ironing board makes a good bench rest .
no disrespect ... l' m surprised you know what a bench rest is .
charles knows what everything is .
got a question , ask him .
charles knows everything .
take a mighty accomplished man to claim that .
i don' t claim anything .
ask him .
see if i' m wrong .
bet you can' t stump him .
bet you i can .
tell you what ...
i will give you $5 . 00 ... if you can tell me what' s on the other side of this blade .
it' s a rabbit smoking a pipe .
hmm .
a rabbit smoking a pipe .
well, well, well .
why in the world would that be ?
uh , it' s a symbol of the cree lndians .
on one side there' s the panther , on the other , his prey , the rabbit .
he sits unafraid .
he smokes his pipe .
it' s a traditional motif .
why is he unafraid ?
because he' s smarter than the panther .
ha !
sir ... you impress me .
oh .
thank you .
amazing accomplishment .
no , it' s not an accomplishment .
it' s a freak .
ls that so ?
yeah .
i seem to retain all these facts , but putting them to any useful purpose is another matter .
hmm .
oh , hey , listen up , folks .
we got a problem with bears around here .
never leave food uncovered , even in the lodge .
never .
you see a bear near you , stand still .
let him know that you know that he sees you .
and back up , hmm ?
real slow .
anybody' s in trouble , get my attention .
i' il be on it like a duck on a june bug .
now , make yourselves comfortable .
i think i' m going to bed .
shut up !
lord , i' m bushed .
new book ?
yes .
it' s about surviving in the wilderness .
you' re always reading something .
yeah .
my secretary gave it to me .
do you know why ?
huh ?
you know why she gave me the book ?
that guy gave me the creeps with all that talk about the bear .
why she gave you the book ?
because you' re the salt of the earth .
oh , is that so ?
you' re the most excellent man .
that' s why i married you .
and you' re the only woman i' ve ever wanted .
well, then ... see what a luck y guy you are ?
yes , i do .
this is a special day for me .
i know it is .
i' m really glad you came away with us .
you should get away more often .
charles .
yeah ?
can you go downstairs and get me a sandwich ?
yeah , ok .
of course .
did i ever tell you you' re an angel ?
no .
everything but the wings .
a sandwich .

whatwe want is wood quite a bit of it, for a signalfire .
when they comefor us , they' il see the smoke .
huh ?
why would they comefor us ?
hmm ?
well, they know we wentto the cabin .
when they go there , they' il see the note .
oh .
i' m afraid we' re infor a walk .
what' s that mean , ' we' re infor a walk " ?
whatthefuck does that mean ?
i once read an interesting book .
it said that most people lost in the wilds, they ...
they die of shame .
what ?
yeah .
they die of shame .
' what did i do wrong ?
' how could i have gotten myself into this ?
and so they sitthere , and they ... die .
they didn' t do the one thing thatwould' ve saved their lives .
and what is that , charles ?
thinking .
look .
steve , look .
all right , here' s the lodge .
here' s the cabin where we were supposed to have gone .
this is where we did go through this pass , mountains , river .
they' il be lookingfor us in the south , all right ?
if we can get back south of this pass by tonight , we can use theflares .
how do wefind it in the woods ?
head south .
aha .
we head south .
how do we know which way is south ?
ok , uh ...
look .
pointthe hour hand atthe sun .
halfway between the hour hand and 12 : 00 is south .
this is broken .
give me yourwatch .
mine' s busted, too .
steve ?
it' s lost .
ok .
all right , i' il tell you .
uh ... the birds will beflying south .
we' ilfollow them .
what if we can' t see them ?
sorry i got us into this !
stopthat !
stop it !
just stop it .
where are you going ?
gonna make a compass .
uh ...
right .
you take a needle , rub it on silk , magnetize it .
and , uh ...
here , place it on a leaf .
here .
you have a compass .
who travels with a needle ?
ah .
here .
ha ha !
oh , shit .
you see ? ltworks .
ltworks .
that peak is south .
what if it isn' t ?
huh ?
it is .
has no choice .
it' s drawn by the earth' s magnetism .
i know how itworks , charles .
good .
then you know .
that' s south .
what do we do when we getthere ?
take another sighting .
it doesn' tfeel south , charles .
just because you' re lost doesn' t mean your compass is broken .
come on .
the vikings would steer their shipwith a rope .
a rope ?
how' d they do that , charles ?
they' d have these two set points on the land ... they' d left behind or sailed awayfrom , and they' d line them up , and thatwould be their bearing .
then they' d trail this long rope behind the ship , pointing it atthose two points the hill orwhatever .
you mightwantto conserve your breath .
oh, yeah .
yeah !
gotto getthrough by nightfall .
come on .
what are the odds thatthey' il see us , thatthey' il see theflares ?
damnfine .
you think so ?
i don' t know , but i have to say so , don' t l ?
city boy .
charles .
yeah ?
ls it my diseased imagination , or did you say ,
' how are you planning to kill me ?
did you say that ?
yeah .
what did that mean ?
why would i wantto kill you , charles ?
for my wife .
for mickey ?
yeah .
that' s a bizarre way to meet girls .
i' d kill you to get nextto yourwife ?
i' ve seen you with her .
charles , baby ...
we worktogether .
no .
i' ve seen the way you are .
no offense , charles , but i can get my own girl , if you' ve noticed since we' ve known each other .
and p. s. , you' re a powerful guy .
why would i want to antagonize you , charles ?
forthe money .
oh .
the money .
now it' s the broad , now it' s the boodle .
nothing is safe .
rich man .
all anybody wants is to take somethingfrom you , and when they want it bad enough, to kill you .
you know something , charles ?
the rich are different .
howfar do you think it is ?
can' t be more than about 10 miles .
aah !

old lndian remedy ?
yeah, that' s right .

you think i' m afool because of what i said .

about my wife .
ah, whatyou said aboutyourwife .
