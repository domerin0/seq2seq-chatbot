as a teacher of children ... ... and a fencing instructor ... ... it' s impossible for me to go begging for money here in morioka .
but i know full well ... ... that without money none of you will live through the winter .
kaichiro ...
mitsu ...
though i might ...
... abandon my clan to earn my living ... ... i will never abandon you .
shizu ... ... look after the new baby when it comes .
kanichiro ...
no !
it has to seem like i left without telling you .
we can' t have words of farewell !
so ... ... i' m going .
kanichiro !
father !
father !
father ...
go home !
you mustn' t see me off !
i won' t .
only just ... hold mitsu one last time .
she doesn' t deserve to have the father she loves ... ... go without a word .
papa ...
papa ...
papa ...
mitsu ...
mitsu ...
papa ...
mitsu ...
father , please don' t cry .
i only wish your departure were a happier one .
squire saito returns !
saito sensei ?
why ?
i don' t know .
squire saito !
stand aside !
i was tired of hiding out .
i went back to the shinsengumi ... ... though i knew perfectly well how bedraggled it had become .
that was all the more reason for me to return .
my sympathies for the unpleasant task that fell to you .
i don' t need your sympathy .
move .
saito sensei ...
miss nui ...
what about her ?
she killed herself .
i see .
i took the liberty of arranging a funeral at koenji temple .
mind your own business .
right then only he knew ... ... my innermost thoughts .
you' re going to kill me ?
a country samurai who doesn' t care what happens ?
doesn' t anything matter as long as you get paid ?
money grubber !
mercenary !
how much are they paying you to kill me ? !
i' m truly sorry .
it was all ... ... downhill from there .
the shogun resigned , and political power returned to the emperor .
the lord of aizu , commissioner of kyoto ... ... was relieved of his post , leaving us with nothing to guard .
okita was dying of tuberculosis ... ... and shinohara , of the ito faction , had shot kondo .
as if seeking its last stand , the shinsengumi joined in the fight ... ... against the southwestern clans .
fighting was all we could do .
squire ono ...
straighten your backs !
stick out your chests !
we are the warriors of mibu !
shinsengumi !
good on you !
shinsengumi !
are you properly dressed ?
if your clothing isn' t good and tight , you will die !
even if you fall , do not drop your sword !
keep swinging it !
if you' re out of breath , grab your opponent .
use any means you can ... ... and come back alive .
they' re coming !
the shinsengumi' s here !
charge !
fire !
forward !
fire !
it was ludicrous .
swords against guns , a foregone conclusion .
the day of the sword ... ... was already far in the past .
nanbu clan godown , osaka
reporting !
the shogun' s forces are retreating .
the southwestern army ... ... is in pursuit .
they' re winning ?
yes , sir .
the shinsengumi' s no help ?
' shinsengumi ' ?
nothing .
we fled with the shogun' s troops .
the other clans deserted us .
on the edge of annihilation , we played our final card .
you all right ?
have some food .
go on , eat .
eat slowly !
saito sensei ...
i got the aizu people to share their supplies with us .
please ...
have you eaten ?
uh ... ... no .
was that the last ?
why didn' t you say ? !
you let me eat the last one !
i' m used to being hungry .
this' il do me fine .
you bastard !
i hate your guts !
why should one shit sack care if another' s full ? !
in a world where men hate enough to kill each other ... ... why are you trying to fill my stomach ? !
saito sensei !
i can' t breathe !
yoshimura ... get out of here .
we' re going to die here ... ... whether we like it or not .
but i don' t want you to .
not a man like you .
mr. saito ...
i am ... ... a nanbu samurai .
a nanbu samurai ... ... lets neither wife nor child sway him from his duty .
when nanbu fights , i will be there first .
i' m truly grateful for the consideration you' ve shown me ... ... but i will never turn my back on my duty .
yoshimura !
saito sensei ... ... my humble thanks .
he was a true samurai .
the enemy !
we' re under attack !
hold your fire !
stop shooting !
swords !
fight or die !
cut them down !
retreat !
retreat !
retreat !
forward !
the emperor' s standard !
we are the imperial army !
withdraw your soldiers !
there will be no mercy for rebels !
are we rebels now ? !
withdraw !
withdraw !!
don' t resist !
don' t resist !
withdraw !
hijikata sensei !
are we rebels ?
hey !
stand your ground !
stay here , i said !
i am kanichiro yoshimura of the shinsengumi !
i serve the tokugawa shogun !
i do not wish to raise my arm against his majesty the emperor ... ... but my duty bids me fight !
i stand against you !
yoshimura !
don' t die !
yoshimura !
yoshimura !
don' t die .
yoshimura !
yoshimura !
yoshimura !
yoshimura !
yoshimura ...
so you knew yoshimura sensei ...
i assume he died at the battle of toba fushimi ...
no .
what , is he alive ? !
after that battle ... ... the war went in favor of the southwestern clans .
my father , jiroemon ono ... ... had been sent to osaka ... ... as godown manager , to steer the clan through the crisis .
leave to speak !
his lordship the shogun ... ... has fled osaka castle , left his army and taken ship for edo .
we know who' s going to win now .
the way forward is clear !
we can either join the emperor and his southwestern clans ... ... or be destroyed with the tokugawas !
i agree !
calm down ... ... or the lower castes will get excited as well .
it is important that we remain absolutely neutral .
we must not take sides .
all we need do is dress normally and strengthen our gate .
we aid no fleeing soldiers ... ... and we say nothing about the war' s outcome .
understood ?
yoshimura sensei picked that time to appear before my father .
kanichiro ? !
yoshimura' s here ? !
he' s in front of the gate , badly wounded .
yoshimura !
what should we do ?
all right , bring him into the back garden .
yes , sir !
why did he have to come now ? !
why ? !
you bloody fool !
you should be ashamed .
yoshimura !
squire jiroemon ...
while our battle has ended ... ... in total defeat ... ... to die here at the hands of some villain ... ... would be a wasted death .
if i may , i would like to be of service to my own land .
i would like to return there .
now ?
a true nanbu samurai ... ... would go back to the shinsengumi and die there like a man .
i beg you !
yoshimura ... ... after what you' ve done ... ... i couldn' t possibly ask the clan to take you back !
at least ... ... until my wounds heal .
for the sake ... ... of all our years of friendship .
to all the men of all the clans !
report all rebel soldiers ... ... to the imperial army !
conceal them ... ... and your clan will be suppressed !
i say again ...
report all rebel soldiers ... ... to the imperial army !
conceal them and your clan will be suppressed !
yoshimura ... ... you' re a disgrace .
we will leave you alone .
kill yourself .
this is not an entertainment !
begone !
i' m sorry , sasuke .
kanichiro ... ... why did you fight at toba fushimi ?
why didn' t you join the shogun at osaka castle ?
together , you might have had a chance .
the way you are now , how could you escape anywhere ?
it was ... ... out of duty i fought .
we lost , it' s true ... ... but i' m not dead yet .
while i' m still alive ... ... i want to go back to morioka .
i want to see shizu ... ... and my children .
nanbu is my land .
i can' t put you on the scales against all of nanbu .
if it were only me , i would die for you .
but i can' t make nanbu the enemy of his majesty just for you .
that sword of yours won' t cut any more .
i' il give you mine .
it' s made by yamato no kami yasusada .
use it to cut open your stomach like a samurai should .
please help him !
father !
sir ?
a hungry man can' t meet death properly .
i' il give him some food .
i didn' t realize .
i' m sorry .
i' il do it .
i didn' t think about it until just now .
take him some hot water as well .
is it snowing ... ... in nanbu now . too ?
powder snow ...
oh , dear ...
now what ?
here .
this rice ...
... comes from nanbu ...
nanbu rice ...
it' s so good ...
so good i drool to think of it .
enjoy it .
take your time and enjoy it .
thank you .
first ...
... one ryo .
a kimono sash for shizu .
this one ryo ... ... is for mitsu' s doll festival stand .
this one' s for keijiro' s baby robe .
well , what do you know ?
here i wanted to buy kaichiro a sword ... ... but i don' t have the money .
kaichiro ...
... nothing could make you cry , could it .
i didn' t ... ... deserve a son like you .
kaichiro and mitsu ... ... and keijiro , who i' ve never seen ...
i want to ... ... hold you .
shizu ... ... what are you doing right now ?
can you hear the words my heart speaks ...
... that i never could say ?
i fell ... ... completely in love with you .
i tried ... ... as hard as i could .
i did all i could .
you ...
... don' t mind , do you ?
shizu ?
it' s all right if i ... ... kill myself ?
forgive me .
' let' s go to the peach tree .
' lf there are any peaches , we' il pick them .
' five for uncle ... '
i can hear mitsu singing ... such a sweet little voice ...
mitsu ... ... you were never out of my mind ... ... even for a single day .
it' s as if ... ... you' re the only one ... ... i wasn' t apart from for even a minute .
so mitsu ... ... even though i kill myself ... ... i' il always be by your side .
now i' m going to die .
shizu ...
kaichiro ...
mitsu ...
keijiro ...
i' m not going to hell , or to heaven .
i' m ...
... going to be with you ...
... every second ...
... with you !
i was there when yoshimura sensei died .
sir ...
take these two things ... " " ... to my home . '
he didn' t use the sword !
you didn' t touch the rice ... ... you stubborn mule !
kanichiro !
kanichiro !
eat !
eat !
it' s nanbu rice .
from morioka , grown with kitakami river water .
eat !
kanichiro ... ... because of you ... ... shizu and the children eat their fill .
it' s your turn now .
you dreamed of nanbu rice .
eat , kanichiro !
it' s good !
kanichiro !
kanichiro !
he was named one of lord tokugawa' s advance guard ... ... and served well .
rather than suffer dishonor ... ... he asked to commit hara kiri .
that was his choice ?
yes .
he refused a second ... ... and bravely , alone ... ... cut open his stomach .
with that sword ?
no .
he wanted to give it to you .
he didn' t want it stained .
he used another .
i see ...
husband ... ... thank you .
you worked so hard ... ... to support us .
thank you .
so that' s what happened ...
ordering him to do that must have broken your father' s heart .
suddenly , after that ... ... my father was like a different man .
they must never become the imperial army !
the southwestern clans started this war .
they are the rebels !
he had always been so cautious ... ... but when akita went over to the southwestern clans ... ... he led the attack on it .
i call on the samurai of nanbu to do their duty !
i can only think ... ... that he was looking for death in battle himself .
and , sadly , he found it .
may all be well with you .
squire chiaki !
kaichiro ...
i' m going to hakodate to fight .
at the fort there ?
yes .
you' il never come back alive out of there !
i don' t care .
that' s not very smart .
why go if you know you won' t come back ?
the duty of a nanbu samurai is to fight until the very last .
don' t go !
don' t go !
mitsu ... ... you can' t stop him .
this is far enough , squire chiaki .
thank you .
this is pure spring water .
let' s drink from it ... ... for luck .
drink from my hands .
now you drink from mine .
here .
i won' t take it !
when everyone else is trying to stay alive ... ... you' re going to die !
you' re only 16 !
you haven' t lived yet !
why do you have to die ?
squire chiaki ... ... i can' t leave the father i love to cross the river of death alone .
so please ... drink .
kaichiro ... ... don' t die !
kaichiro !
chiaki ...
chiaki ...
chiaki !
kaichiro ... ... don' t die !
don' t die !
brother !
don' t go away !
mitsu ...
i have to .
brother !
brother !
brother !
look after her , will you ?
i will go and fight for nanbu .
brother !
brother !
brother !
kaichiro never came back to morioka .
he died in the battle of hakodate .
brother !
mitsu !
i' il be your big brother now .
and then , later on ... ... i married mitsu .
there !
all finished !
well done !
sorry to keep you .
minoru ...
i don' t think it' s serious .
just a cold .
i' ve mixed some medicine for his symptoms .
give it to him after meals , and see he gets lots of rest .
make sure you take this .
ok ?
my humble thanks , yoshimura sensei .
well ...
thank you for your help .
take care .
come on .
morioka , in nanbu .
it' s a beautiful place .
away to the south is mt hayachine ... ... with mt nansho and mt azumane to the west .
in the north are mt iwate and mt himekami .
out of the high mountains ...
grandpa , carry me !
no !
a samurai walks !
yes , sir .
ah , it' s pretty as a picture !
there' s nowhere like it in all japan !
may all be well with you .
mitsu has lost so many who are close ... ... that even now in sleep she holds my hand and won' t let go .
words can' t express how much of a help mitsu has been to me .
after my father died in battle ... ... my family were treated as rebels and suppressed .
but perhaps that was luck , as it made it possible for me ... ... to marry mitsu .
sasuke , who has become the boss of a gambling syndicate ... ... looks out for us even now .
mitsu and i have decided to move to china ... ... where we will practice medicine in manchuria .
we will cross the sea and live in that empty land ... ... and do the best we can there .
morioka , in nanbu .
it' s pretty as a picture !
there' s nowhere like it in all japan !
the morioka cherry blossom splits through rock to bloom .
the morioka magnolia blooms even facing north .
so i want you to run ahead of the times .
go wild .
bloom .
