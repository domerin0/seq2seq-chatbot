there is justice in the world .

the first great democratic medium .

thank you .
hey , waitress , what are you waiting for ?
funny guy .

and fuck me sideways with a beautiful line like that .
what did he do ?

i' m waiting for you .

i totally love you .
why is this ?

i want to be there for you .

i told you ...
i want to be alone .

to grieve .
to think .
i love you .

buster .
let' s go to this thing ... then i' il get my train .
i' il be away one night .
i' il be back before you know it , okay ?
do these people pay you ?
or do you pay them ?
like it ?
no .
what were you so sad about ?
life .
what' s that , then ?
so what do you reckon , in general ?
you want to talk about art ?
i know it' s vulgar to discuss the work at an opening of the work ... but someone' s got to do it .
i' m serious .
what do you think ?
it' s a lie .
it' s a bunch of sad strangers photographed beautifully ... and all the glittering assholes who appreciate art ... say it' s beautiful because that' s what they want to see .
but the people in the photos are sad ... and alone .
but the pictures make the world seem beautiful ... so the exhibition' s reassuring , which makes it a lie .
and everyone loves a big , fat lie .
i' m the big , fat liar' s boyfriend .
bastard .
larry .
alice .
so you' re anna' s boyfriend .
a princess can kiss a toad .
frog .

my guy says , " hang on .
these are second rate jokes .
i' ve got a first rate joke .
sit back and take notice .
so we go , " okay , what' s the joke ?
it' s based on a christmas carol ...
which is why it seems so relevant on christmas day .
i haven' t even seen you for a year .
yes , you have .
only because you stalk me outside my studio .
i don' t stalk .
i lurk .
and when i' m not there you look for me .
how do you know if you' re not there ?
because i am there ...
lurking from a distance .
look at me .
tell me you' re not in love with me .
i' m not in love with you .
you just lied .
i' m your stranger .
jump .
hello , stranger .
hello .
intense conversation ?
his father died .
were you spying ?
lovingly observing ... with a telescope .
he' s taller than in his photo .
his photo' s a headshot .
yeah , i know .
but his head implied a short body , when , in fact , his head is deceptive .
deceptive ?
he' s actually got a long body .
he' s a stringy fucker .
i could have him .
what ?
lf it came to it , in a scrap , i could have him .
did you tell him we call him cupid ?
no , that' s our joke .
i had a chat with young alice .
fancy her ?
of course .
not as much as you .
why not ?
you' re a woman .
she' s a girl .
she has the moronic beauty of youth , but she' s sly .
she seems open to me .
that' s how she wants to seem .
you forget you' re dealing with a clinical observer of the human carnival .
am i , now ?
yes .
you seem more like the cat that got the cream .
stop licking yourself .
that' s the nastiest thing you' ve ever said to me .
that' s horrible .
i' m sorry .
i' m so sorry .
where have you been ?
work thing .
had a drink with harry .
you never have one drink with harry .
you know he' s in love with you .
no , he' s not .
is he ?
did you eat ?
i' il make you something .
i' m not hungry .
what ?
this will hurt .
i' ve been with anna .
i' m in love with her .
we' ve been seeing each other for a year .
it began at her opening .
have a nice one .
cheers , guvnor .
don' t move .
i want to remember this moment forever .
first time i walked through the door , returning from a business trip ... to be greeted by my wife .
i have , in this moment , become an adult .
thanks for waiting up , you darling .
you goddess .
i missed you .
how about some tea ?
jesus , i' m knackered !
didn' t you sleep on the plane ?
no ... because the permed german next to me was snoring like a messerschmitt .
what' s the time ?
about midnight .
time .
what a tricky little fucker .
my head' s in two places .
my brain actually hurts .
do you want some food ?
no , i need a bath .
i' il run it for you .
no , i' il have a shower .
you okay ?
how was the thing ?
as dermatological conferences go , it was a riot .
how was the hotel ?
someone told me that the beautiful people of the paranoid hotel ... the concierge , the bellboys and girls ...
did you know this ?
they' re all whores .
everybody knows that .
i didn' t .
i don' t suppose you' d fancy a friendly poke .
i just had a bath .
right .
i' il see to myself , then , in the elle decoration bathroom .
you chose that bathroom .
and every time i wash in it i feel dirty .
it' s cleaner than i am .
it' s got attitude .
the mirror says , " who the fuck are you ?
you chose it .
doesn' t mean i like it .
we shouldn' t have this .
i hear middle class guilt .
working class guilt .
why are you dressed if you just had a bath ?
we needed some milk .
you okay ?
you ?
yeah .
i' m going .
i' m sorry .
irrelevant .
what are you sorry for ?
everything .
why didn' t you tell me before ?
cowardice .
is it because she' s successful ?
no , it' s because she doesn' t need me .
did you bring her here ?
yes .
didn' t she get married ?
she stopped seeing me .
is that when we went to the country ?
to celebrate our third anniversary ?
did you phone her ?
beg her to come back ?
when you went for your long , lonely walks ?
yes .
you' re a piece of shit .
deception is brutal .
i' m not pretending otherwise .
how ?
how does it work ?
how do you do this to someone ?
not good enough .
i fell in love with her , alice .
as if you had no choice ?
there' s a moment .
there' s always a moment .
i can do this , i can give in to this , or i can resist it .
and i don' t know when your moment was , but i bet you there was one .
i' m going .
it' s not safe out there .
and it' s safe in here ?
what about your things ?
i don' t need things .
where will you go ?
disappear .
the sultan has returned bearing gifts .
thank you .
they' re beautiful .
here' s a thing .
alice was at the hotel .
what ?
they sell these arty postcards in the lobby .
i bought one to boost your sales .
young woman , london .
and i checked for your book in the museum of modern art .
it was there .
someone bought one .
this guy with a ridiculous little beard .
he was drooling over your photo on the inside cover .
he fancied you , the geek .
i was so proud of you .
you' ve broken new york .
you' re wonderful .
don' t ever forget it .
can i still see you ?
dan , can i still see you ?
answer me .
i can' t see you .
if i see you , i' il never leave you .
what will you do if i find someone else ?
be jealous .
you still fancy me ?
of course .
you' re lying .
i' ve been you .
will you hold me ?
i amuse you , but i bore you .
no .
you did love me ?
i' il always love you .
i hate hurting you .
then why are you ?
' cause i' m selfish .
and i think i' il be happier with her .
you won' t .
you' il miss me .
no one will ever love you as much as i do .
why isn' t love enough ?
i' m the one who leaves .
i' m supposed to leave you .
make some tea , buster .
why are you dressed ?
because i think you might be about to leave me ... and i didn' t want to be wearing a dressing gown .
i slept with someone in new york .
a whore .
i' m sorry .
why did you tell me ?
i couldn' t lie to you .
why not ?
because i love you .
it' s fine .

why ?
something' s wrong .

because of this ?
why ?
dan .

since my opening last year .
i' m disgusting .
you' re phenomenal .

i stopped seeing him .
i wanted us to work .
why did you tell me you wanted children ?
because i did .
and now you want children with him ?
yes .
i don' t know .
but we' re happy ... aren' t we ?
you' re gonna go live with him ?
you stay here if you want .
i don' t give a fuck about the spoils .
you did this to me the day we met .
you let me hang myself for your amusement .
why didn' t you just tell me when i walked in the door ?
i was scared .
you' re a coward , you spoilt bitch .
are you dressed because you thought i might hit you ?
what do you think i am ?
i' ve been hit before .
not by me .
is he a good fuck ?
don' t do this .
just answer the question .
is he good ?
yes .
better than me ?
different .
better ?
gentler .
what does that mean ?
you know what it means .

no .
i treat you like a whore ?
sometimes .
why would that be ?
i' m sorry , you' re ...
don' t say it .
you' re too good for me .
i am , but don' t say it .
you' re making the mistake of your life .
you' re leaving me because you believe that you don' t deserve happiness ... but you do , anna .

i may be rich , but i' m not stupid .
what a shame , doc .
i love them rich and stupid .
don' t you fuck around with me .
i apologize .
accepted .
all the girls in this hellhole , the pneumatic robots ... the coked up baby dolls , and you' re no different .
you all use stage names to con yourselves you' re someone else ... so you don' t feel ashamed showing your cunts and assholes to strangers .
i' m trying to have a conversation .
you' re out of cash .
i paid for this room .
this is extra .
we met last year .
wrong girl .
talk to me !
i am .
talk to me in real life .
i didn' t know you' d be here .
i know who you are .
i love you .
i love everything about you that hurts .
she won' t even see me .
you feel the same .
i know it .
you can' t cry in here .
hold me .
let me hold you .
we' re not allowed to touch .
come home with me .
it' s safe .
let me look after you .
i don' t need looking after .
everyone needs looking after .
i' m not your revenge fuck .
i' il pay you .
i don' t need your money .
you have my money .
thank you .
" thank you . " is that some kind of rule ?
just being polite .
do you get a lot of grown men crying their guts out here ?
occupational hazard .
have you ever desired a customer ?
yes .
then put me out of my misery .
do you desire me ?
because i' m being pretty honest about my feelings for you .
your feelings ?
whatever .
no , i don' t desire you .
thank you .
thank you sincerely for your honesty .
you think you haven' t give us anything of yourselves ?
do you think because you don' t love us or desire us ... or even like us , you think you' ve won ?
it' s not a war .
if i asked you to strip right now , would you ?
of course .
do you want me to ?
no .
alice , tell me something true .
lying is the most fun a girl can have without taking her clothes off ... but it' s better if you do .
you' re cold .
you' re all cold at heart .
what do you have to do to get a bit of intimacy around here ?
maybe next time i' il have worked on my intimacy .
no , i' il tell you what' s gonna work .
you' re gonna take your gear off right now .
you' re gonna turn around very slowly , and you' re gonna bend over ... and you' re gonna touch the fucking floor for my viewing pleasure .
is that what you want ?
what else could i want ?
i' m sorry .
what happened ?
traffic .
do you want to go stand in the back ?
no , let' s have a drink .
you look flushed .
you have no need to run .
vodka tonic ?
yes .
vodka tonic and a guinness , please .
sure .
how was it ?
fine .
you had lunch ?
then what ?
and then we left .
and ?
there' s no " and .
you haven' t seen him in four months .
there must be an " and .
how is he ?
terrible .
keep the change .
thank you , sir .
how is his dermatology ?
he' s in private practice now .
is he ?
was he weeping all over the place ?
some of the time .
poor bastard .
was he difficult ?
are you angry that i saw him ?
no .
it' s just ...
i haven' t seen alice .
you can' t see alice .
you don' t know where she is .
i haven' t tried to find her .
you know why i saw him .
he' s been begging me for months .
i saw him so he' d sign .
so has he signed ?
yes .
congratulations .
you' re a divorce .
double divorce .
sorry .
how do you feel ?
tired .
i love you .
and i need a piss .
i hate this place .
at least it' s central .
i hate central .
central london' s a theme park .
i hate retro .
i hate the future .
where does that leave me ?
come back .
you promised you wouldn' t .
come back .
how' s work ?
jesus .
work' s shit , okay ?
do they have waiters here ?
i love you .
please come back .
i' m not coming back .
sign .
no pen .
pen .
give me back my hand .
sign .
i' il sign on one condition .
we skip this .
we go to my sleek new surgery ... and we christen the patients ' bed with our final fuck .
i know you don' t want to ... and i know you think i' m sick for asking , but that' s what i' m asking .
for old times ' sake .
because i' m obsessed with you .
because i can' t get over you unless ...
because i think , on some small level ... you owe me something for deceiving me so exquisitely .
for all these reasons , i am begging you to give me your body .
you' d be my whore .
and in return , i will pay you with your liberty .
you do this , i swear i will not contact you again .
i' m going to the bar .
i assume you still drink vodka tonic ?
you slept with him , didn' t you ?
what do you expect me to do ?
understand .
why didn' t you lie to me ?
because we said we' d always tell each other the truth .
what' s so great about the truth ?
try lying for a change .
it' s the currency of the world .
i did what he wanted , and now he will leave us alone .
i love you .
i didn' t give him anything .
your body ?
if alice came to you , desperate ... with all that love still between you ... and she said she needed you to want her ... so she could get over you , you' d do it .
i wouldn' t like it either , but i' d forgive you .
it' s kindness .
no , cowardice .
you haven' t got the guts to let him hate you .
i' m doing this because i feel guilty , and because i pity you .
you know that , don' t you ?
yes .
feel good about yourself ?
no .
it' s gone .
we' re not innocent anymore .
don' t stop loving me .
i can see it draining out of you .
it' s me , remember ?
it was a stupid thing to do , and it meant nothing .
if you love me enough , you' il forgive me .
are you testing me ?
no .
i do understand .
no .
he understands .
all i can see is him all over you .
he' s clever , your ex husband .
i almost admire him .
you going to tell him ?
i don' t know .
better to be truthful about this kind of thing .
sign .
i forgive you .
sign .
i think you enjoyed it .
he wheedles you into bed .
the old jokes ... the strange familiarity .
i think you had a whale of a time .
and the truth is i' il never know unless i ask him .
why don' t you ?
yes ?
you can go in now .
i want anna back .
she' s made her choice .
i owe you an apology .
i fell in love with her .
my intention was not to make you suffer .
so where' s the apology ?
you cunt .
i apologize .
if you love her , you' il let her go ... so she can be happy .
she doesn' t want to be happy .
everybody wants to be happy .
depressives don' t .
they want to be unhappy to confirm they' re depressed .
if they were happy , they couldn' t be depressed .
they' d have to go out into the world and live , which can be depressing .
anna' s not a depressive .
isn' t she ?
i love her .
boo hoo .
so do i.
she' s gone back to you because she can' t bear your suffering .
you don' t know who she is .
you love her like a dog loves its owner .
and the owner loves the dog for so doing .
you' il hurt her .
you' il never forgive her .
of course i forgive her .
i have forgiven her .
without forgiveness we' re savages .
you' re drowning .
you only met her because of me .
yeah .
thanks .
it' s a joke .
your marriage is a joke .
here' s a good one .
she never sent the divorce papers to her lawyer .
now , to a towering romantic hero like you , i don' t doubt i am somewhat common .
but i am , nevertheless , what she has chosen ... and we must respect what the woman wants .
if you go near her again , i swear ...
i will kill you .
okay .
i have patients to see .
when she came here , do you think she enjoyed it ?
i didn' t do it to give her a nice time .
i fucked her to fuck you up .
a good fight is never clean .
and of course she enjoyed it .
as you know , she loves a guilty fuck .
you' re an animal .
yeah ?
what are you ?
you think love is simple .
you think the heart is like a diagram .
have you ever seen a human heart ?
it looks like a fist wrapped in blood !
go fuck yourself .
you writer !
you liar !
you go check a few facts while i get my hands dirty .
she hates your hands .
she hates your simplicity .
i spent the whole of last week talking about you .
i know all your ways .
anna says you fucked her with your eyes closed .
she tells me you wake in the night crying for your mother , you mommy' s boy .
i could go on .
shall we stop this ?
it' s over .
accept it .
you don' t know the first thing about love ... because you don' t understand compromise .
don' t cry on me .
i' m sorry .
i don' t know what to do .
you want my advice ?
you go back to alice .
she' d never have me .
she' s vanished .
no , she hasn' t .
i found her , by accident .
she' s working in a club .
yes , i saw her naked .
no , i did not fuck her .
you spoke to her ?
yes , i know .
one minute .
how is she ?
she loves you ... beyond comprehension .
your prescription .
it' s where she works .
go to her .
thank you .
you still pissing about on the net ?
not recently .
i wanted to kill you .
i thought you wanted to fuck me .
don' t get lippy .
i liked your book , by the way .
thanks .
you stand alone .
with anna .
you still writing obituaries ?
busy ?
i was made editor .
yeah ?
how come ?
previous editor died .
alcohol poisoning .
i sat with him for a week in the hospital .
i really do have patients to see .
thank you .
for what ?
being kind .
i am kind .
your invoice is in the post .
i lied to you .
i did fuck alice .
sorry for telling you .
i' m just not big enough to forgive you .
buster .
show me the sneer .
beautiful .
you' il wake up the hotel .
fuck me .
again ?
we have to get up at 6 : 00 .
how can one man be so endlessly disappointing ?
that' s my charm .
so where are we going ?
my treat .
where are we going ?
my holiday surprise .
my rules .
where are we going ?
new york .
you angel .
you did remember to pack my passport ?
of course .
it' s with my passport .
and where' s that ?
in a place where you can' t look .
no one sees my passport picture .
when we get on the plane , we' il have been together four years .
what about the gap ?
you mean trial separation ?
didn' t work out .
happy anniversary .
i' m going to take my eyes out .
what was in my sandwiches ?
tuna .
how many stitches did i get ?
two .
but you should have had three .
what was your euphemism ?
disarming .
too easy , buster .
next ?
that park .
who' d i go there with ?
your father .
were the chairs in the hospital gray or blue ?
no idea .
trick question .
they were green .
you are a trick question .
how come we never took a vacation ?
we went to the country .
doesn' t count .
you were off making sneaky phone calls ... to that witch we do not mention .
come to bed .
i need a smoke .
how' d you manage to give up ?
deep inner strength .
why me ?
you could have chosen anyone .
why me ?
because you cut off your crusts .
and this .
when are you going to stop stripping ?
soon .
you' re addicted to it .
no , i' m not .
it paid for this .
tell me what happened .
nothing happened .
but he came to the club .
lots of men come to the club .
you came to the club .
the look on your face .
the look on your face .
what a face .
what a wig .
i saw this face ... this vision ... when you stepped into the road .
it was the moment of my life .
this is the moment of your life .
you were perfect .
i still am .
on the way to the hospital ...
i kissed your forehead .
you brute .
the cabbie saw me kissing you .
he said , " is she yours ?
i said , " yes , she' s mine .
she' s mine .
so he came to the club , watched you strip , you had a little chat , and that was it ?
yes .
you' re not trusting me .
i' m in love with you .
you' re safe .
you had every right .
i just want to know .
why ?
because i want to know everything .
because i' m a lunatic .
tell me .
nothing happened .
you were living with someone else .
what are you justifying ?
i' m not justifying anything .
just saying .
what are you saying ?
i' m not saying anything .
i just want the truth .
where are you going ?
cigarettes .
everywhere' s closed .
i' il go to the terminal .
when i get back ... please tell me the truth .
why ?
because i' m addicted to it .
because without it we' re animals .
trust me .
i don' t love you anymore .
since when ?
now .
just now .
i don' t want to lie ... and i can' t tell the truth ... so it' s over .
it doesn' t matter .
i love you .
none of it matters .
too late .
i don' t love you anymore .
goodbye .
here' s the truth ... so now you can hate me .
larry fucked me all night .
i enjoyed it .
i came .
i prefer you .
now go .
i knew that .
he told me .
you knew ?
i needed to hear it from you .
why ?
because he might have been lying .
i had to hear it from you .
i would never have told you , because i know you' d never forgive me .
i would .
i have .
why did he tell you ?
because he' s a bastard .
how could he ?
because he wanted this to happen .
but why test me ?
because i' m an idiot .
yes .
i would have loved you ... forever .
now please go .
don' t do this .
talk to me .
i am talking .
fuck off .

you misunderstand .
i didn' t mean to ...
yes , you did .
i love you .

where is this love ?
i can' t see it .
i can' t touch it .
i can' t feel it .
i can hear it .
i can hear some words ... but i can' t do anything with your easy words .
whatever you say , it' s too late .
please don' t do this .
it' s done .
