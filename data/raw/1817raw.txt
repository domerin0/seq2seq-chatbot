peter .
you could not watch even one hour with me ?
master , what has happened to you ?
should i call the others , lord ?
no , john .
i don' t want them to see me like this .
are you in danger ?
should we flee , master ?
stay here .
watch ... ... pray .
what is wrong with him ?
he seems afraid .
he had spoken about danger while we ate ...
he mentioned betrayal and ...
thirty .
thirty , judas .
that was the agreement between me ... and you ?
yes .
where ?
where is he ?
hear me , father .
rise up , defend me .
save me from the traps they set for me .
do you really believe ... ... that one man can bear ... ... the full burden of sin ?
shelter me , o lord .
i trust in you .
in you i take refuge .
no one man can carry this burden ... ... i tell you .
it is far too heavy .
saving their souls is too costly .
no one .
ever .
no .
never .
father , you can do all things .
if it is possible , let this chalice pass from me ...
but let your will be done ... ... not mine .
who is your father ?
who are you ?
who are you looking for ?
we' re looking for jesus of nazareth .
i am he .
hail , rabbi !
judas ... ... you betray the son of man with a kiss ?
peter !
put it down !
those who live by the sword shall die by the sword .
put it down .
malchus !
get up !
we' ve got him .
let' s go !
what , mary ?
what is it ?
listen ...
why is this night different from every other night ?
because once we were slaves ...
... and we are slaves no longer ...
they' ve seized him !
everyone you can , hear ?
to the courtyard of the high priest .
quick !
go !
halt !
not so fast .
this is not your party , you toothless vermin .
peter ...
hey !
what' s going on here ?
in there !
stop them !
they' ve arrested him !
in secret !
in the night !
to hide their crime from you !
stop them !
what are you yelling about , woman ?
who have they arrested ?
jesus .
jesus of nazareth !
shut up !
she' s crazy .
a criminal .
brought in for questioning , that' s all .
broke the temple laws .
i see .
better go tell him there' s more trouble brewing .
tell who ?
abenader , you idiot .
get going !
go !
jesus ...
are you hungry ?
yes , i am .
this is certainly a tall table !
who is it for ?
a rich man .
does he like to eat standing up ?
no .
he prefers to eat like ... so .
tall table , tall chairs !
well , i haven' t made them yet .
this will never catch on !
oh , no you don' t !
take off that dirty apron before you come in .
and wash your hands .
it has begun , lord .
so be it .
sir , there' s trouble at ...
what , in the middle of the night , abenader ?
i' m sorry .
what' s the problem ?
trouble within the walls .
caiphas had some prophet arrested .
who ?
some galilean .
the pharisees apparently hate the man .
a galilean ?
who are you talking about ?
who is this beggar you bring to us ... ... chained up like a condemned man ?
he' s jesus , the nazarene troublemaker .
you' re jesus of nazareth ?
they say you' re a king .
where is this kingdom of yours ?
what line of kings do you descend from ?
speak up !
you' re just the son of some obscure carpenter , no ?
some say you' re elijah .
but he was carried off to heaven in a chariot !
why don' t you say something ?
you' ve been brought here as a blasphemer !
what do you say to that ?
defend yourself .
i have spoken openly to everyone .
i' ve taught ... ... in the temple where we all gather .
ask those who have heard what i have to say .
is that how you address the high priest ?
with arrogance ?
if i have spoken evil ... ... tell me what evil i have said .
but if not , why do you hit me ?
yes , we' il listen to those who heard your blasphemies .
good !
let' s hear them .
he cures the sick by magic !
with the help of devils !
i' ve seen it .
he casts out devils , with the help of devils .
he calls himself the king of the jews !
no , he calls himself the son of god !
he said he would destroy the temple ... ... and rebuild it in three days !
worse !
he claims he' s the bread of life !
and if we don' t eat his flesh or drink his blood ... ... we won' t inherit eternal life .
silence !
you' re all under this man' s spell .
either offer proof of his wrongdoing ... ... or be quiet !
this entire proceeding is an outrage .
all i' ve heard from these witnesses is mindless contradiction !
who called this meeting anyway ?
and at this hour of the night ?
where are the other members of the council ?
get him out of here !
get out !
a travesty !
that' s what this is , a beastly travesty !
haven' t you anything to say ?
no answer to these accusations ?
i ask you now ... ... jesus of nazareth ...
tell us , are you the messiah ?
the son of the living god ?
i am ... ... and you will see the son of man seated at the right hand of power ... ... and coming on the clouds of heaven .
blasphemy !
you heard him .
there' s no need for witnesses !
your verdict .
what is your verdict ?
death !
haven' t i seen you in the company of the galilean ?
yes !
you' re one of his disciples !
i recognize you !
quiet !
i' ve never met the man .
i don' t know him .
you are peter !
one of the disciples of jesus .
i don' t know the man !
you are wrong !
stop !
stop !
i' ve seen you before !
stop him !
he' s one of them !
you' re wrong , damn you !
i swear i don' t know the man .
i' ve never seen him before .
wherever you go , lord ... ... i will follow .
to prison , even to death .
amen , i say to you ... ... before the cock crows ... ... three times you will deny me .
peter ?
no , no ...
i am unworthy !
i have denied him , mother !
denied him three times .
let' s go !
you take care of it .
let him pass .
he' s harmless .
release him !
take back the silver .
here !
i' ve sinned , betrayed innocent blood .
take back your silver .
i don' t want it !
if you think you' ve betrayed innocent blood , that' s your affair .
take your money and go .
now go !
what' s wrong ?
are you all right ?
look at his mouth .
hey , can we look at it ?
you need help ?
can we help ?
he' s bleeding !
look !
blood !
leave me alone ... ... you little satans !
aha !
cursing !
are you cursed ?
he' s cursed !
yes , a curse !
it' s inside him , look !
watch out , it' s like burning oil from his bones !
get away from me !
leave me alone !
don' t condemn this galilean .
he' s holy .
you will only bring trouble on yourself .
do you want to know my idea of trouble , claudia ?
this stinking outpost , that filthy rabble out there .
do you always punish your prisoners before they' re judged ?
governor ...
what accusations do you bring against this man ?
well ...
if he weren' t a malefactor , we wouldn' t have brought him before you .
that' s not what i asked .
why don' t you judge him according to your own laws ?
consul , you know it' s unlawful for us ... ... to condemn any man to death .
to death ?
what has this man done to merit such a penalty ?
he has violated our sabbath , consul .
go on ...
he has seduced the people ... ... taught foul , disgusting doctrines .
isn' t he the prophet you welcomed into jerusalem only five days ago ?
and now you want him dead ?
can any of you explain this madness to me ?
your excellency , please ...
so far the high priest hasn' t told you this man' s greatest crime .
he has become the leader of a large and dangerous sect ... ... who hail him as the son of david !
he claims that he is the messiah ... ... the king promised to the jews .
he has forbidden his followers to pay tribute to the emperor , consul !
bring him here !
go !
drink .
are you the king of the jews ?
does this question come from you ?
or do you ask me this because others have told you that is what i am ?
why would i ask you that ?
am i a jew ?
your high priests , your own people delivered you up to me .
they want me to have you executed .
why ?
what have you done ?
are you a king ?
my kingdom is not of this world .
if it were ... ... do you think my followers would have let them hand me over ?
then you are a king ?
that is why i was born .
to give testimony to the truth .
all men who hear the truth hear my voice .
truth !
what is truth ?
i have questioned this prisoner , and i find no cause in him .
this man is a galilean , is he not ?
he is .
then he is king herod' s subject .
let herod judge him .
governor ...
hand him over .
jesus of nazareth !
where ?
where is he ?
this ... ... is jesus of nazareth ?
is it true that you restore sight to the blind ?
raise men from the dead ?
where do you get your power ?
are you the one whose birth was foretold ?
answer me !
are you a king ?
how about me ?
will you work a little miracle for me ?
take this stupid fool out of my sight .
he' s not guilty of a crime , he' s just crazy .
give him a fool' s homage ...
what is truth , claudia ?
do you hear it , recognize it when it is spoken ?
yes , i do .
don' t you ?
how ?
can you tell me ?
if you will not hear the truth , no one can tell you .
truth ...
do you want to know what my truth is , claudia ?
i' ve been putting down rebellions in this rotten outpost for eleven years .
if i don' t condemn this man ... ... i know caiphas will start a rebellion .
if i do condemn him , then his followers may .
either way , there will be bloodshed .
caesar has warned me , claudia .
warned me twice .
he swore that the next time the blood would be mine .
that is my truth !
herod refuses to condemn the man .
they' re bringing him back here .
we' re going to need reinforcements .
i don' t want to cause an uprising .
there is already an uprising .
king herod found no cause in this man .
neither do i.
men !
attend to the crowd !
quiet !
have you no respect for our roman procurator ?
as you know , every year i release a criminal back to you .
we are now holding a notorious murderer ... ... barabbas .
which of the two men would you have me release to you ?
the murderer barabbas ?
or jesus , called the messiah ?
he is not the messiah !
he is an imposter !
a blasphemer !
free barabbas !
again i ask you : which of these two men should i release to you ?
free barabbas !
free him .
what would you have me do with jesus the nazarene ?
have him crucified !
no !
i will chastise him ... ... but then i will set him free .
see to it that the punishment is severe , abenader .
but don' t let them kill the man .
my heart is ready , father ... ... my heart is ready .
my son ... ... when , where , how ... ... will you choose to be delivered of this ?
if the world hates you ... ... remember that it has hated me first .
remember also that no servant is greater than his master .
if they persecuted me , they will persecute you .
you must not be afraid .
the helper will come ... ... who reveals the truth about god ... ... and who comes from the father .
stop !
enough !
your orders were to punish this man ...
... not to scourge him to death !
take him away .
get going !
get him out of here !
your majesty ...
take care of it .
a beautiful rose bush .
look at him ... king of the worms !
hail , wormy king !
a color fit for a king !
we' re here to pay our respects .
a leader for our brotherhood !
behold the man .
crucify him !
isn' t this enough ?
look at him !
crucify him !
shall i crucify your king ?
we have no king but caesar !
speak to me .
i have the power to crucify you , or else to set you free .
you have no power over me ... ... except what is given you from above .
therefore , it is he who delivered me to you ... ... who has the greater sin .
if you free him , governor ... ... you are no friend of caesar' s .
you must crucify him !
it is you who want to crucify him , not i. look you to it .
i am innocent of this man' s blood .
