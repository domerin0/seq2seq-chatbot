well , if libby here likes us as much as we like her , we should just go ahead and move to adopt her baby girl .
who' s the father ?
honestly , i don' t know .
carlos and gaby made a deal ...
i did remarry my ex , but it was only because he has great health insurance .
susan made amends ... you know , i never thought i' d have such a good time hanging out with my girlfriend and her husband .
and mike ... didn' t she mention we dated ?
made a confession ... liar !
you' ve just been leading me on !
you' re obviously still in love with this guy !
of his own .
on her first day of sobriety ,
bree van de kamp found an old cork , which reminded her just how much she craved chablis .
so she called her sponsor , who came over with a dvd which they watched till her craving had passed .
five days later , after she developed a thirst for merlot ,
peter arrived with a deck of cards .
the next week , he brought over chinese takeout because bree had told him she was consumed by thoughts of vintage chardonnay .
by her 20th day of sobriety , bree had stopped thinking because her thoughts re now centered elsewhere .
hmm ... yeah , huh .
i' m curious , peter .
what is the easiest way to overcome addiction ?
oh , some folks try shock therapy .
other use , uh , hypnosis .
but taking it one day at a time still makes the most sense to me .
why ?
i don' t know .
i guess i' m just impatient to get on with my life .
what are you doing ?
i was just giving you a little kiss .
why ?
well , it' s just my way of saying thank you for everything you' ve done for me over the past few weeks .
what' s ... wrong ?
this is gonna seem like it' s coming out of left field , but in addition to being a recovering alcoholic ,
i' m also a member of s. a.
sex addicts anonymous .
oh .
and that' s a ... a real thing ?
yes .
sex is as much an addiction for me as booze .
that' s why when you turn me on like that , it' s a bit of a problem .
it was just a peck on the cheek .
it doesn' t matter .
the slightest touch gets my juices flowing .
so ... how long has it been since you ... a year .
they have this rule ... plant , pet , person .
if i can keep a plant alive , you know , then i can move on to a pet .
and if i can make that work , then i can start dating again .
so how are you doing ?
i' m on my fourth ficus .
oh .
see ?
i think you can handle affection better than you give yourself credit for .
oh !
oh !
oh !
oh , oh !
i' m sorry .
um ...
i think i should go .
really ?
yeah .
peter !
but ... but ... you forgot your shirt !
keep it .
though she didn' t know it ,
bree had answered her own question .
the easiest way to overcome one addiction ... is to replace it with another .
temptation ... it' s the name of a well known establishment on the outskirts of fairview .
its clientele is devoted .
everyone who goes there wants to get their hands on something .
and when they cross a line ... hey !
i warned you , pal .
they are punished ... as a certain married couple were about to discover .
hi .
you want a lap dance ?
uh ... no , thanks .
no .
i sure hope libby likes this camera .
well , why wouldn' t she ?
it' s exactly what she asked for , the most expensive one in the store .
you know , i' m telling you , carlos .
i' m getting really tired of kissing her ass .
the woman is giving us her baby .
we' il kiss whatever needs kissing .
what the hell are you guys doing here ?
uh , we brought you this gift , and you said that you didn' t want us coming by your house ... thanks , but i' m working , so you gotta go .
look , we spent a lot of money on that .
the least you can do is open it so we can bask in your happy expression .
is there a problem here ?
no , we' re just talking .
it' s ... everything' s fine .
carlos solis .
this is my wife , gabrielle .
we' re friends of libby' s .
oh , hey , i' m frank , libby' s boyfriend .
libby , you didn' t tell us you had a boyfriend .
didn' t i ?
i thought i had .
what' s that , a present for our baby ?
i' m sorry , did you just say " our " baby ?
yeah .
it' s our first .
hey !
what' s for lunch ?
omelettes .
you want me to make you one ?
no , thank you .
i' il just pick at yours .
i didn' t know you still had a key , dad .
of course i do .
i have to watch out for my two favorite ladies .
try the cheese .
that' s the best part .
mmm .
you mean , two of your three favorite ladies .
you know , when you add in edie .
right !
of course .
and speaking of edie , i have some big news .
i finally did it .
i popped the question .
oh !
congratulations , dad !
yeah ... congratulations .
um , what happened to waiting six months ?
edie and i aren' t getting married tomorrow .
it takes months to plan a classy wedding , you know ?
remember ours , hmm ?
you had to have it outdoors , huh ?
ugh .
it poured .
i could have murdered that weatherman .
we were all crammed under this little gazebo thing it was hysterical .
i thought the whole wedding day was ruined .
i loved it !
it felt spontaneous .
all our friends gathered close around us , hmm ?
remember ?
you said it was the happiest day of your life .
just like you marrying edie will be the happiest day of her life .
yeah .
right .
her , too .
toodles .
oh , hi .
hello .
andrew said it was all right for me to get a cream soda .
uh , sure .
help yourself .
there' s also frosted glasses in the freezer .
can is fine , but thank you .
oh , and , uh , i left a list for you of the witnesses we' il be deposing .
it' s , uh , there on the counter .
hi .
hey .
i know that you' re still angry with me , and , um ...
i wanted to tell you that i have , um ... joined a recovery program .
a. a.
i just wanted you to know that ... and to tell you i' m sorry .
you are ... a real friend , and i value your honesty .
oh , i don' t wanna be mad anymore .
and i' m so happy to hear all that , and i am so proud of you .
oh , thanks , but i' m not really out of the woods yet .
i still have this whole court case hanging over my head .
i heard about that .
andrew' s asking to be emancipated ?
yes , and his lawyer is taking depositions now to see if i am a fit parent .
oy .
and considering that mishap that i had with your kids ,
i , uh , i imagine he' il be anxious to talk to you .
well , it makes sense , i guess .
yeah .
do you have any idea what you might say ?
i , um ...
i' il focus on your good qualities .
i could not ask for anything more .
thanks .
see you around , i hope .
all right .
that' s ... not why you came to apologize , is it ?
what do you mean ?
to soften me up for the deposition .
of course not .
um ...
i just want you to understand something .
andrew is making accusations ... false accusations , saying that i abused him , all because i wouldn' t let him have his trust fund early so he could buy a car .
i mean , can you blame me for wanting to know if i have your support ?
and ... so ... what , you want me to lie ?
make you look good ?
i actually don' t want anything of the sort .
good .
because when i give my deposition ,
i' m going to tell the truth .
to what do i owe this pleasure ?
i want you to look at something .
myra holt is talking to paul young , chatting away with him as though he were any other neighbor .
now i told her he killed my sister .
i mentioned it to her six months ago when we were standing in the express line at the market .
but still , there she is , yakking away .
oh , mike .
i' m afraid people' s memories aren' t what they used to be .
what do you want , felicia ?
i wanna see how good your memory is , if you recall a certain promise you made to me .
i am not gonna kill him .
why not ?
give me one good reason .
because things have changed .
how ?
my sister still lies rotting in the ground .
so does dierdre .
no , i don' t see how anything' s changed at all .
you' re just gonna have to let this go .
sounds to me as though someone' s let go of his rage .
maybe i have .
well , i haven' t .
and that bitch of a stripper lied to us .
the father' s totally in the dark .
he clearly wants to keep the baby .
mr. solis , if the father wants to assert his rights here , there' s nothing we can do .
i' il find you another baby .
i promise .
i don' t want another baby .
i want this one !
oh , honey , he' s right , okay .
that trashy girl has been lying to us from the get go .
let' s just walk away while we can .
it' s not worth it .
look , don' t get cold feet now , gaby , please .
all right ?
let' s just pay frank the way we paid libby and then bring the baby home .
wait , wait , wait ... you paid libby ?
you said we could give her gifts .
everybody loves getting cash .
i could probably be disbarred for even listening to this .
i cannot condone baby buying !
and i sure as hell can' t be part of it .
oh , mr. beale , come on .
no , no , hear me out .
if you are determined to go down this dark road , and unbeknownst to me steal this ... paternal rights waiver that' s sitting on my desk , and have this frank guy sign both sides and date the top ,
i can' t be part of that , either .
hmm .
okay , l i' m gonna go to dad' s .
oh , wait !
why don' t you let me walk with you ?
uh , shouldn' t you be resting ?
no !
i' m fine .
the doctor said i should actually keep my blood flowing .
well , do you have to do it while we walk over to edie' s ?
i just ...
i don' t wanna risk you running into dad .
okay ... you guys have just been so chummy lately , and ... this whole flirting thing is kind of freaking me out .
wait a second , we' re ... we' re not flirting .
mom , you fed him eggs with your fork .
okay , yes ,
i am closer to your father than i have been in the past .
the bitter hatred' s now settled into a respectful disgust .
that' s the kind of thing most children of divorce dream about .
hey , edie .
what' s all this stuff for ?
oh , hi !
don' t tell anyone , but i' m planning a huge surprise for karl .
a surprise ?
yeah , i' m putting together an engagement party tomorrow afternoon .
oh , cool .
but that' s not the surprise .
actually , it' s gonna be a surprise wedding .
i know !
my pilates teacher got ordained over the internet .
the , uh , church of the divine something or other .
i' m not sure .
anyway , it' s all legal .
and , well , just one more day before i make an honest man out of your daddy .
oh !
you' re so sweet .
thank you so much for your good wishes .
oh .
no , edie , wait .
um , no , it' s just that ... you know , i was married to karl , and i used to ... try to surprise him , and he would always , always , always say ...
no , usan .
don' t surprise me .
i don' t like it .
whatever .
i' m doing it , so keep your trap shut .
now if you' il excuse me ,
i' ve gotta go and buy a wedding dress .
oh , and by the way , i' il be wearing white , so that' il be a surprise for everybody .
i don' t know why i have to get dragged into this .
what happened with my kids has nothing to do with bree' s situation with andrew .
sit .
well , it' s my understanding that real harm could have come to your children as a direct result of your friend' s behavior .
i' m sorry , mr. bormanis , but i' m not gonna testify .
it just doesn' t feel right to me .
well , this isn' t the first time someone' s felt the way you do .
so this isn' t the first time i' ve had to say that if you refuse to give a deposition of your own accord ,
i' il compel you to give one .
but i' m sure i won' t have to .
you' re saying bree did this ?
while under the influence .
i understand your reluctance to turn on a friend , but this isn' t about you .
it' s about andrew .
don' t you think he' s suffered enough ?
how much are you gonna give him ?
i figured we could start with forty .
thousand ?
he' s a bouncer in a strip club .
offer him eight .
he' s not going to sell his baby for $8 , 000 .
are we talking about the same idiot ?
i think for $8 , 000 , you throw in a kidney .
i' m not gonna blow this by bargain hunting .
you know , that' s your problem , carlos .
remember when you bought your car ?
you paid sticker .
nobody pays sticker !
okay , and what' s the sticker price on a child , huh ?
tell me that .
i' m thinking $12 , 000 .
frank , you have to sign the paper .
i made a deal with these people .
a deal ?
this isn' t a used car we' re talking about .
it' s our baby .
before you screw this up , just remember that i can go to the cops and tell them about the pot farm you have going on in our basement .
it' s just a couple plants .
yeah , i don' t do it for profits .
hobby , mostly .
oh , come on , frank .
you know you would be a lousy father .
it' s my kid !
and i have a right to mess her up if i want .
and if you go near the police , i' il tell ' em how you' ve been stealing all those tips from sheila .
okay , we' re done .
gaby , gaby , no , just ... hold on .
now maybe there' s a way that we can work this out together .
there is nothing to work out .
if frank is not on board with this , it' s over .
wait !
uh ... it doesn' t matter what he wants .
why not ?
because it' s not your baby .
that' s a lie .
what if i took a paternity test ?
will that shut you up ?
wait , if it' s not frank' s , then whose is it ?
i' m not sure .
all' s i know is ,
i got pregnant right after i worked at the calgary rodeo , and i was very popular there .
so what are you saying , you screwed a bunch of cowboys ?
you have your hobbies ... and i have mine .
you think this is funny ?
oh , don' t you get it ?
we just got our baby back .
um ...
well , you take care now .
ahem .
yeah .
hi .
i got , uh , your message that you wanted to see me before the meeting started .
yeah , i did .
um , there' s someone i' d like to introduce you to .
bree , this is donna .
donna , this is bree .
what' s up ?
hi .
donna is gonna be your new sponsor .
i , um , i don' t want a new sponsor .
i' m ...
i' m very comfortable working with you .
look , this was always just a temporary arrangement .
and given what happened the other night ,
i think it' s best if we just end this now .
peter , all we did was kiss .
we' d be kidding ourselves if we didn' t think that whatever' s between us isn' t going to affect our recovery .
it' s not a good time for change in my life , peter .
terrible things are happening .
i' m headed to court .
i need your support now more than ever .
you' il have support , bree .
it just won' t be mine .
but , peter ...
oh , bree could never have done that !
i' m just telling you what the lawyer said .
so you think bree punched andrew in the face ?
' cause i don' t .
i don' t either , but on the other hand , she spanked my kids , she lied about her drinking and i once saw her bitch slap her mother in law .
so i' m torn .
well , i' m siding with bree .
how can you be so sure ?
we have andrew saying that it' s systematic physical abuse .
and then we have bree saying it' s andrew wanting to be emancipated so he can get at his trust fund so he can buy a car .
how are we supposed to know the real truth ?
because i remember being 17 .
and i would' ve done a hell of a lot more than punch myself in the eye to get a car .
karl !
karl , stop !
stop !
oh !
it' s an emergency .
just calm down .
what' s going on ?
edie is gonna marry you tomorrow .
what ?
she' s planned this whole secret wedding .
it' s a surprise .
god , i hate surprises !
i know .
i told her that .
i said : " he always , always hates surprises .
all right , don' t get yourself all worked up here .
put our heads together .
we' il come up with something .
so the thing you gotta know about me is my style is proactive .
i don' t hold your hand if you go on a bender .
i believe in behavior modification .
hmm .
some muffins ?
oh .
oh , that' s okay .
i i' m not big on snacks .
you should also know ...
i' m not a lesbian .
oh !
well , good for you .
well , see , if i was , the program wouldn' t let me be your sponsor .
not great for your recovery if we get tangled up in a little somethin ' .
so , um , whatever vibe you might be getting , that' s all on you .
um , donna ...
l i really appreciate everything that you' ve been doing for me , but i think i was really making some progress with peter as my sponsor .
and i was thinking ... all right , stop right there !
you' re fixating on peter .
well , i just really feel like i' m jeopardizing my recovery by switching ... you' re making cuses .
see , i have a 99 % success rate as a sponsor because i have 0 % tolerance for people who lie to themselves .
now come on .
come on ?
where are we going ?
hiking .
there' s nothing like it to take your mind off booze .
i got it !
i' il just be the woman .
i' il say i want a big wedding .
you know , the church , the big ballroom , smushing cake in her face ... it' il take months to plan .
that' s great .
and of course , i' il have to tell her you' re the one who ruined the surprise .
you' re gonna make me take the hit ?
yeah .
hey , guys .
what you doing out here ?
uh , just talking .
oh , well , come on in .
i' ve got something to show you .
oh , no , that' s okay .
come on !
you' il love this .
wait until i leave to tell her , ' cause she' s gonna kill me .
well , i should go .
i' m not gonna scream or cry or pound your faces in with a mallet , which , lord knows , is my right .
but what i will say is that you two are the most reprehensible excuses for human beings that i have ever met !
do you have anything to add ?
right .
what the hell .
oh !
get out !
get ...
hey , mrs. scavo .
that' s a ... that' s a sweet ride .
yeah , you think so ?
why don' t you come over here for a second ?
i' d like to pick your brain .
you' re the demographic that my client is interested in , so you' d actually be doing me a favor if you drove it around for a couple hours , and tell me what you thought .
do you mind ?
are you kidding me ?
i can' t believe you are old enough to drive .
i still remember when you were 10 years old .
i paid you a dollar to rake our leaves .
yeah .
yeah , you were pretty cheap .
is this set up for mp3 ?
uh , all the bells and whistles , but listen ...
i really wanted to tell you how sorry i am .
hmm ?
your lawyer came to see me .
i' m going to be deposed .
it' s going to be hard for me ... yeah .
yeah , i know .
you just have to remember she' s a different person when she drinks .
she must be .
it' s hard for me to imagine the bree i know capable of hurting you .
yeah .
do you have the keys ?
oh .
sure .
anyway , i just ...
i feel so guilty that this all went on in your house , right under our nose .
so if there is anything i can do to help you ... well , can you get a discount on these ?
um ... actually , yeah .
one of the perks .
even so , it' s a little out of the price range of a high school student .
well , if you tell my lawyer the truth ,
i don' t think money' s gonna be a problem .
hi .
what' s going on ?
edie wants to discuss our little ... deception .
exactly how ugly is this gonna get ?
how long does it take to shut a door ?
i can forgive your trickery .
i can forgive the humiliation .
but what i can' t forgive is the complete and utter lack of faith in me !
i mean , having susan get married for insurance was my idea !
okay , so if i' d known that everything had gotten all screwed up , of course i would' ve agreed .
look , edie , in retrospect ... yes , we didn' t think .
we didn' t handle this the way mature adults should have .
he' s right .
we behaved like children ... naughty , stupid children .
well , that makes me feel better that you could admit that .
because ... when naughty children misbehave , they know that they' re gonna get punished .
don' t they ?
punished ?
mm hmm .
at this point ,
i' d like to point out that , uh , it was karl who proposed .
karl .
you are gonna throw me an elaborate wedding .
yes , of course .
anything , baby .
how elaborate ?
well , figure out exactly what it is that you could afford , and triple it .
as for you ... okay , now remember , i' m broke .
i' m well aware of your church mouse status .
i don' t intend to lift a finger during the planning and execution of this crushingly expensive wedding .
no .
no , of course not .
and anything i can do to help ... uh , you know , i would ...
i could help with how' s that ?
well , i wasn' t planning on inviting you .
but ...
i will need a bartender .
oh , oh , and , um ... make sure you come in through the back door .
you' re just in time .
mrs. scavo has been sworn in , so we' re all ready to start .
hey .
hi .
all right , we are now on the record .
okay .
isn' t it true that while your children were in bree' s care , that she passed out drunk and allowed them to wander off to a downtown business district ?
my kids don' t wander .
they scurry , like rats .
excuse me ?
do you know a rat can fit through a hole the size of a quarter ?
anyway , my children have that trick down , too .
mrs. scavo , are you saying that you don' t hold mrs.
van de kamp responsible for endangering your children ?
no , i don' t hold her responsible .
bree van de kamp and i have known each other a long time .
i trust her completely .
she' s a wonderful friend and a fantastic mother .
she puts the rest of us to shame .
she' s lying !
are you gonna let her get away with this crap ?
please .
do you consider mrs. van de kamp to have a drinking problem ?
no .
then why did you line empty wine bottles up on her front stoop ?
i was helping bree with her recycling .
do i need to remind you of the potential consequences of perjury ?
no , you don' t .
in fact , i hate liars .
hello ?
peter .
hi , it' s bree .
hey , bree .
you know , um , if you feel like you' re gonna need a drink , you should call donna .
no !
no , l i don' t feel like i' m gonna drink .
and if i did , i certainly would call donna .
i mean , she and i are just ... we' re just really clicking .
oh , that' s good .
so why are you calling ?
i know it' s really late notice , but a friend of mine , uh , got engaged and she' s throwing a party , and i thought , um , maybe you' d like to come .
bree ... well , you' re not my sponsor anymore , so i assume this is allowable .
i mean , it' s just a casual get together .
and they' re having sushi .
you do like sushi , don' t you ?
bree ...
okay , peter , i just really ... need us to be friends .
when i' m with you , i' m not myself , which is a good thing .
i can ...
i can relax when i' m with you in a way that i can' t when i' m with other people .
with them , i have to pretend that i have it all together , but ... you know that i don' t , so it' s just so much easier .
come on , it' s just a ... it' s just a dumb old party .
bree ... do not call me again .
oh !
paul !
i am so glad you made it .
i appreciate the invitation , edie .
although , frankly , i' m a little surprised to get it considering how people in this neighborhood feel about me .
oh .
you know me .
i like to be inclusive .
ooh !
it' s heavy .
uh , unh unh .
this is flat .
i think i' d like , um ... a rusty nail .
a what now ?
it' s a cocktail , well , i' m not really sure what' s in it .
but it sounds obscure and complicated , so chop chop .
be right there .
hey , hey .
put that down .
we gotta go .
our birth mother just went into labor .
what ?
that' s fantastic !
yeah , can you believe it ?
we' re gonna be parents .
i' il go get the car .
come on .
we were supposed to have four weeks .
she promised me the baby wasn' t due for four more weeks .
we don' t have anything !
we don' t ... we don' t have diapers , and we don' t have the stuff babies drink .
formula .
you know , this is a total inconvenience .
welcome to parenthood .
come on .
this is your father' s bartender bible .
see if you can find a recipe for a rusty nail .
okay .
um , mom ?
where' d you find that ?
it was stuck in here between a pink squirrel and a pisco sour .
oh .
well , why is your father keeping this ?
why you think ?
hey , susie .
karl , this marriage ... our marriage , this fake marriage , that' s what it is , right ?
fake .
what are you talking about ?
what' s this ?
nothing .
yeah ?
mm hmm .
okay , then , repeat after me .
our marriage is fake ,
and i' m going to marry the woman i really love ...
edie britt .
if that' s what you want me to say .
no , no , no , no !
it' s not about what i want you to say .
you have to want to say that you want to marry edie .
don' t worry about this , susie .
why are you hanging on to that ?
i need to look at it from time to time .
why ?
consider it my punishment .
for screwing up the best thing that ever happened to me .
oh .
oh , no , no , no .
this is not happening .
no , wha ... mmm .
mmm !
oh , karl !
oh !
will you ...
are you crazy ? !
just tell me what to do , susie .
if you want me to marry edie , i will .
you want me to call off the wedding , i' il do it .
i' il do whatever you want .
i' m putty .
karl !
whoa !
what are you doing ?
i' m , just , uh , putting away some coats .
oh .
well , it' s time to open my presents .
let' s go .
oh , hello .
hi .
hi .
um , i need some advice from a professional .
i' d like to get stinking drunk .
do you have anything that can accomplish that in a hurry ?
i forgot the lamaze book in my purse !
oh , forget it .
come on .
let' s go .
we' il wing it .
oh , we missed it !
the kid just slipped right out .
are you family ?
they' re the parents .
would you like to help ?
no , thanks .
you guys look like you got it covered .
oh , are you sure , honey ?
come on , gaby .
i just , um ...
l i don' t wanna do anything to screw it up .
she won' t break .
here .
okay .
hi .
hi .
oh , honey , you were right .
about what ?
it was all worth it .
serving bowls .
just what i needed , lynette .
there' s a gift receipt taped to the bottom of the box .
oh .
thank god !
okay , the next one is from felicia .
i do hope you like it .
oh , you know what they say ... good things come in small packages .
what is it ?
teeth ?
dentures .
they were my dear sister martha' s .
i' m sure none of you knew , but she had orthodontic issues from the time she was a ild .
oh .
thank you .
i know it' s an unconventional gift for an engagement party , but you and martha were such close friends , edie .
i wanted you to have something truly personal to remember her by , since she left us so ... abruptly .
you know , when paul young strangled her , crushed her windpipe and buried her alive next to a garbage strewn hiking trail .
felicia , uh ...
i think you' ve had enough .
i do apologize if i' ve offended anyone , but ... while you all are chitchatting and eating these gummy hors d' oeuvres , just remember ... you' re in the company of a murderer .
bree ?
bree ?
why didn' t you call donna ?
hmm .
i don' t need donna .
i need you .

look , just buckle up !
temptation comes to all of us .
whether or not we succumb depends on our ability to recognize its disguise .
sometimes it arrives in the form of an old flame , flickering back to life .
or a new friend who could end up being so much more .
or a young child who awakens feelings we didn' t know we had .
and so we give in to temptation , all the while knowing come morning , we' il have to suffer the consequences .
