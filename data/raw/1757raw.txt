an elective valve , no big deal .

i saw the chart on balford .
i' m on the committee .
it' s on review .
it wasn' t your fault .
i know .
then what' s the problem ?
i don' t know .
you put up a terrific fight .

don' t you ever wonder who it is we' re fighting with ?
so i' m crazy and chemically imbalanced .
you' re tired .
you have moments .
why didn' t you call me ?
because i never sleep when you stay over .
you never sleep whether i stay over or not .
you' re good .
you know it .
come back monday and get back on the horse .
doctor ?
i' il see you .
as i walk along the stony shore of the pond in my shirtsleeves ....
... amazon basin in the north , once an island sea ....
the highest truth on the subject remains unsaid ... ... probably cannot be said .
for all that we say is the far off remembering of the intuition ...
... she begins to pull away from the awareness she had once ....
commencing search . " searching my soul .
what happened to the cards ?
you could touch the cards .
she' s been looking at me for half an hour .
maybe if i just hang here ....
this is a delicious evening , when the whole body' s one sense ....
what if i screamed ?
what if i just screamed right now ?
when a woman decides to sleep with a man ....
you knew there would always be a spring ... ... as you knew the river would flow again after it was frozen .
when the cold rains kept on and killed the spring ... ... it was as though a young person had died for no reason .
all right , they have rescheduled the operation for monday .
what happened yesterday ?
they had a golf tournament .
who knows with these people ?
good morning , mr. messinger .
the " g " is soft , like " messenger .
what' s on your lip ?
what ?
am i slobbering here ?
where did you get that ?
what am i , a prisoner ?
you want to get well , or you want ben & jerry' s ?
this operation is a big deal .
continue to eat like this ... ... and you might as well skip it .
save the 30 grand .
if you' d have performed the operation yesterday like you were supposed to ... ... l' d be sucking carrots through a straw in my arm .
what happened ?
circumstances were not optimal for the procedure .
i ain' t " the procedure . " my name is nathan messinger and i' m right here .
hello , hello , hello ....
floating , floating .
don' t pop it .
don' t pop it !
do you know the muffin man , the muffin man , the muffin man ?
hi , anne .
what are you doing here ?
i was on my way up to x ray ... ... and i thought i' d stop in and just ... ... hide .
from what ?
i should' ve gone into pediatrics .
oh , no .
every guy you meet is either married or a gyno .
never date a man who knows more about your vagina than you do .
poor little guy .
he never stops crying .
what' s wrong with him ?
no insurance .
found him in a dumpster behind the house of pies .
we worked him up the wazoo for everything ... ... from drug exposure to diabetes .
we got nothing .
may l ?
did you do an ultrasound ?
you hear a murmur ?
worth a shot .
okay , baby .
so what are you hiding from ?
my patient' s wife .
she wants me to tell her that her husband is going to be okay ... ... and that i have every confidence ... ... and i don' t .
and after all this time , and after all this work ... ... l suddenly have this feeling that ... ... none of this is in my hands .
nothing .
and if it isn' t ... ... what do i do with that ?
excuse me .
are you a visitor ?
yes .
visiting hours have been over since 8 : 00 .
why do they have that ?
what ?
hours .
doesn' t it help the patient to be visited ?
who are you visiting ?
mr. messinger ?
right now ?
you .
i don' t need a visitor .
you' re not ill ?
no .
i' m one of the doctors here .
are you in despair ?
i lost a patient .
you did everything you could ?
i was holding his heart in my hand when he died .
then he wasn' t alone .
yes , he was .
people die .
not on my table .
people die when their bodies give out .
it' s my job to keep their bodies from giving out .
or what am i doing here ?
it wasn' t your fault , maggie .
i wanted him to live .
he is living .
just not the way you think .
i don' t believe in that .
some things are true whether you believe in them or not .
how did you know my name ?
what' s yours ?
seth .
you better get out of here , seth ... ... or security' s going to think you' re a psych patient .
where are we ?
down a liter .
suction .
i am stuck on band aid brand ' cause band aid' s stuck on me
no dying now , mr. messinger .
not until you give me seth' s phone number .
i am stuck on band aid brand ' cause band aid' s stuck on me
those eyes .
the way he looked ... ... right down into me .
seth .
what kind of name is seth ?
i thought you' d be here .
salty .
my transplant tanked at 2 a . m .
you okay ?
you might want to return this .
that part about the spring ?
you knew there' d always be a spring .
how did you know that ... ?
what ?
i didn' t give you this book .
you didn' t ?
where' d you get it ?
hi .
i' m a physician , and i think a patient left that in my office .
can you tell me who checked it out ?
i can' t tell you who .
i can tell you when .
all right , give me 5 minutes .
hello , maggie .
it' s nice to see you again .
it' s weird to see you again .
weird is nice .
you like hemingway ?
yeah , i' m starting to .
may l ?
as i ate the oysters with their strong taste of the sea ... ... and their faint metallic taste ... ... as i drank their cold liquid from each shell ... ... and washed it down with the crisp taste of the wine ... ... l lost the empty feeling ... ... and began to be happy .
he never forgets to describe how things taste .
i like that .
do you come here a lot ?
i live here .
what do you do ?
read .
no , i mean , your work .
i' m a messenger .
what kind of messenger ?
a bike messenger ?
no , i' m a messenger of god .
got a message for me ?
i already gave it to you .
did you use my pager ?
i usually don' t get my messages unless you beep me .
you' ve definitely been beeped .
how is messinger ?
he' s good .
the operation went really well .
it was a good day .
it was .
yeah , i didn' t kill anybody today .
you' re an excellent doctor .
how do you know ?
i have a feeling .
that' s pretty flimsy evidence .
close your eyes .
it' s just for a moment .
what am i doing ?
you' re touching me .
touch .
how do you know ?
because i feel it .
you should trust that .
you don' t trust it enough .
let' s go somewhere .
where ?
i don' t care .
what do you want to do ?
anything .
what' s that like ?
what' s it taste like ?
describe it .
like hemingway .
well , it tastes like ... ... a pear .
you don' t know what a pear tastes like ?
i don' t know what a pear tastes like to you .
sweet ... ... juicy .
soft on your tongue .
grainy ... ... like sugary sand that dissolves in your mouth .
how' s that ?
it' s perfect .
the first time i looked in a microscope , i knew i wanted to be a doctor .
okay , let me have your hand .
what for ?
we' il take a look at your blood .
not a possibility .
men .
i suppose you know a woman' s threshold of pain ... ... is 9 times higher than a man' s .
take a look at that .
that' s bright .
that' s me .
all those cells .
that' s all you are .
that and all the space in between .
if this is all you are ... ... these cells ... ... then when they die , that' s the end .
i don' t know .
i think so .
how do you explain it ?
what ?
the enduring myth of heaven .
i used to think that i had it all figured out .
but you didn' t ?
no .
because something happened in my o. r. and i got ... ... this jolt .
i got this feeling that there' s something ... ... bigger out there .
something bigger than me , bigger than you , and it ....
does that sound crazy ?
no .
i couldn' t fix him .
i did everything right ... ... and i couldn' t fix him .
that' s not supposed to happen .
and i ....
you cried .
yeah .
why do people cry ?
what do you mean ?
i mean , what happens physically ?
tear ducts operate on a normal basis to lubricate and protect the eye .
when you have an emotion , they overact and create tears .
why ?
why do they overact ?
i don' t know .
maybe emotion becomes so intense ... ... your body just can' t contain it .
your mind and your feelings become too powerful .
your body weeps .
i have to go .
i got to go .
stay right here .
don' t go anywhere .
stay right there .
get the tube out .
he can' t breathe .
it' s because the tube is blocked .
how you feeling ?
ready to hit the waves .
i' m afraid your bodysurfing days are over .
you got a mean tattoo going there .
what does your wife think of that ?
that is my wife .
check his vitals every 15 .
i can' t see you , but i know you' re there .
go back and tell them that i' m not going .
not yet .
where have you been ?
oh , shit .
i totally forgot dinner .
dinner ?
with who ?
a guy i met .
i bumped into him and we got something to eat .
did you pack my backpack ?
what else ?
we talked ... ... and then i got beeped and he disappeared .
why did you pack my backpack ?
earl , what are you doing ?
i thought we' d fly up to tahoe , use your uncle' s cabin ... ... maybe do a little hiking .
what ?
god .
is it ... ?
maggie , it' s just a tick .
get a match .
we' re not going to burn him , jordan .
it' il have to back out .
can' t leave the head in .
we can' t just be burning tick heads .
then get some alcohol .
i don' t have any .
you don' t have any alcohol ?
i don' t operate here .
how about some olive oil ?
which kind ?
jalapeo or rosemary ?
rosemary .
so what did you and your friend what did you say his name was ?
seth .
what did you two talk about ?
dying .
come on , we deal with life and death every day .
why can' t we talk about it ?
i hope you won' t become a surgeon who prays in the o. r.
can we talk for a minute ?
we' il talk while camping .
jordan , i can' t go camping now .
we need some time together .
all right , let' s see if we can just spend 5 minutes .
let' s see if we can just stand still together for 5 minutes .
doing what ?
just being here .
i' il get the trail map .
no , i mean it .
nothing but us .
what do i do ?
just look at me .
you can' t do it .
you can' t do it .
you flinched .
you lose !
you cheat .
that old black magic called ... ... love .
thank you very much .

we' ve been talking to mothers who are members of the kkk .
you want to watch anything ?
me neither .
how do you know when i' m here ?
i know .
jeez , you look good .
i forgot how good everybody looked .
30 years of silence .
you got guts , kid , showing yourself like that .
i appreciate that .
i do .
it' il make it easier .
i got to tell you , i feel fine .
you might want to check your orders ... ... because i sure don' t feel like i' m dying .
you' re not dying .
right .
then how come you' re hanging around my room all the time ?
i' m the only one with his ass hanging out of his dress .
unless ....
could it be ... ... the doctor ?
sure .
the doctor .
she' s pretty .
a little flat chested ... ... but all you need' s a handful .
who are you ?
this is good .
this is what they call ... ... " serendipitous .
look that up in the dictionary , you' il see a picture of you and me .
thank you .

there you go .
good grip .
nathaniel messinger .
glutton , hedonist ... ... former celestial body , recent addition to the human race .
i don' t believe you .
you want proof ?
you hang out at a library .
you can speak every language .
you travel with the speed of thought ... ... and you' re reading my mind right now .
stop that .
you' re doing it .
it' s impossible .
some things are true whether you believe them or not .
how ?
you choose .
choose ?
to fall to earth .
you take the plunge , the tumble , the dive .
you jump off a bridge .
leap out a window .
you just make up your mind to do it and you do it .
you wake up all smelly , and aching from head to toe ... ... and hungrier than you' ve ever been ... ... only you have no idea what hunger is or any of that stuff ... ... so it' s all real confusing and painful , but very , very good .
human .
he gave these bozos the greatest gift in the universe .
you think he didn' t give it to us too ?
which gift ?
free will , brother .
free will .
couldn' t get a job .
no past , no training .
no l . d.
then one day , i was walking past a building site .
a skyscraper .
and i thought , " i could do that .
you see , these people down here ... ... a lot of them are afraid of heights , you know what i' m saying ?
that makes me uniquely qualified .
and besides , it feels like a little bit of home up here .
and i like what i do .
i' m good at it .
these things' il kill you .
are there others ?
others like you ?
yeah , they' re out there .
you see them , but most of the time you just walk on by .
nobody likes to think of the old life .
you know , what they gave up .
then why' d you do it ?
my daughter , ruth ... ... her stupid husband , frank ... ... and my grandkids .
petie' s 4 , hannah' s 6 .
and this is my wife , teresa .
did you ... ... tell her who you were ?
i started to try once or twice .
then i thought , " why do that to her ?
do what ?
it' s too much for them .
people don' t believe in us anymore .
do they still gather together at sunrise ?
and sunset , yes .
take me there ?
can you hear it ?

i can' t hear that !
but you can' t feel this !

and then you just ... ... fall .
fall ?
dive .
you make up your mind to do it ... ... and you do it .
and when you wake up , you' re ... ?
yes .

taste water .
read a newspaper .
to lie .
through your teeth .
to feed the dog .
touch her hair .

love ?
i don' t know .
what does that mean ?
i was hoping you could tell me .
it' s a word ... ... that describes a chemical react
it' s just crap .
i' m full of crap .
i wait all day , just hoping for one more minute with you ... ... and i don' t even know you .
