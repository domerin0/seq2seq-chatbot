your fianc is dead .
oh , my god !
do something !
get down .
we need a new vehicle .
hey , come on .
we gotta keep moving .
she killed scott because of me .
look , i know this won' t help ... ... but sometimes things happen that we just can' t change .
it' s not your fault .
are you sure about this ?
about her and me , i mean .
your confusion is not rational .
she' s a healthy female of breeding age .
there' s more to it than that .
my database does not encompass the dynamics of human pair bonding .
so this terminatrix , how many others does she have on her hit list ?
twenty two .
anderson , elizabeth .
anderson , william .
barrera , jose .
brewster , robert .
my father ?
having failed to acquire its primary target , t x will resume its default program .
she' s gonna kill my father too ?
there' s a high probability .
no .
who is he ?
what does he do ?
he' s in the air force .
weapon design , secret stuff .
i don' t know , exactly .
general robert brewster is program director of crs ... ... cyber research systems , autonomous weapons division .
skynet .
you' re talking about skynet .
skynet is one of the digital defense systems developed under brewster .
oh , god .
oh , my god .
of course .
it all makes sense now .
if you hadn' t come back when i was a kid , changed everything ... ... she and i would have gotten together then .
i would have met her father .
don' t you see ?
i don' t understand .
your father .
this is all about your father .
he' s the key .
he always was .
your father is the one who can shut skynet down .
he' s the only one who ever could .
we have to get to him before the t x does .
negative .
i cannot jeopardize my mission .
this is your mission , to save people !
my mission is to ensure the survival of john connor and katherine brewster .
i am giving you an order .
i am not programmed to follow your orders .
after the nuclear war , you both ...
nuclear war ? !
there doesn' t have to be a war !
we can stop it !
there is insufficient time .
the first launch sequences will be initiated at 6 : 18 p . m .
what , today ?
affirmative .
john , what is he saying ?
judgment day .
the end of the world .
it' s today , three hours from now .
two hours and 53 minutes .
we must continue south into mexico to escape the primary blast zones .
no , we have to get to her dad .
the mojave area will sustain significant nuclear fallout .
you will not survive .
you mean we go run and hide somewhere in a hole while the bombs fall ?
it is your destiny .
fuck my destiny .
john .
you cannot self terminate .
no , you can' t .
i can do whatever i want .
i' m a human being .
i' m not some goddamn robot .
cybernetic organism .
whatever !
either we get her father to shut skynet down ... ... stop this shit from ever happening , or so much for the great john connor .
because your future , my destiny , i don' t want any part of it .
i never did .
based on your pupil dilation , skin temperature and motor functions ... ... i calculate an 83 % probability that you will not pull the trigger .
please do what he says .
you have to save my father !
we can reach crs in approximately one hour ... ... depending on traffic conditions .
i can' t get a line .
the whole cell network is down .
skynet is assuming control over global communications ... ... in preparation for its attack .
so if this war is between people and machines ... ... why are you on our side ?
the resistance captured me and reprogrammed my cpu .
i was originally designed for assassination missions .
so ... ... you don' t really care if this mission succeeds or not .
if we get killed , does that mean anything to you ?
if you were to die , i will become useless .
there will be no reason for me to exist .
thank you for doing this .
your gratitude is not required .
i am programmed to follow your commands .
her commands ?
katherine brewster had me reactivated and sent through the time displacement field .
what exactly am i in this future of yours ?
you' re john connor' s spouse and second in command .
no , i ...
what ?
you' re a mess .
hey , you' re not exactly my type , either .
why didn' t i send you back ?
i am not authorized to answer your question .
why didn' t he send you back ?
he was dead .
well , that sucks .
humans inevitably die .
yeah , i know .
so how does it ... ?
no .
maybe i don' t want to know .
how does he die ?
john connor was terminated on july 4th , 2032 .
i was selected for the emotional attachment he had for my model number ... ... due to his boyhood experiences .
this aided in my infiltration .
what are you saying ?
i killed you .
this has to be a mistake .
as of 1100 hours , all primary military systems were secure .
they were .
only the civilian sector was affected .
internet , air traffic .
minutes ago , guidance computers at vandenberg crashed .
we thought it was an error .
it looks like the virus .
early warning in alaska is down .
satellite signals are scrambled .
what about the missile silos , the subs ?
we' ve lost contact .
you' re saying this country is completely open to attack .
theoretically , we could be under attack already .
who' s doing this ?
a foreign power or some computer hacker in his garage ?
we can' t trace the virus or pin it down .
it keeps growing and changing , like it has a mind of its own .
this can' t be happening .
the pentagon' s on the secure line .
it' s the chairman .
all right .
look ... ... none of this is gonna happen .
we get to your dad , get him to pull the plug on skynet .
the bombs won' t fall .
he won' t have to kill me someday .
he' il never even exist .
you and i , we can just go our separate ways .
you know , mike kripke' s basement ...
that was the first time i ever kissed a guy .
really ?
your levity is good .
it relieves tension and the fear of death .
we' re hoping you have a solution for us .
i know , sir , but skynet is not ready for a system wide connection .
that' s not what your civilian counterparts there told me .
they say we can stop this damn virus .
i understand there' s a certain amount of performance anxiety ... ... but your boys say if we plug skynet into all of our systems ... ... it' il squash this thing and give me back control of my military .
mr. chairman , i need to make myself very clear .
if we uplink now , skynet will be in control of your military .
but you' il be in control of skynet , right ?
that is correct , sir .
then do it .
and brewster , if this thing works ... ... you' il get all the funding you' il ever need .
yes , sir .
sir ?
shall i ?
no .
it' s my job now .
skynet defense system activated .
we' re in .
we' re past the firewalls , local defense nets , minutemen , subs .
skynet' s fully operational , processing at 60 teraflops a second .
it should take less than a minute to find the virus and kill it .
let' s pray to god this works .
power failure ?
no .
i don' t know what it is .
what the hell is going on ?
daddy !
what are you doing here ?
daddy !
get away from it !
watch out !
daddy , don' t move .
she' il be back .
we have to shut down skynet .
where' s the system core ?
in this building ?
skynet .
the virus has infected skynet .
skynet is the virus !
it' s why everything' s falling apart !
skynet has become self aware .
in one hour it will initiate a massive nuclear attack on its enemy .
what enemy ?
us !
humans .
oh , god !
it' s the machines .
they' re starting to take over .
my office , on this floor , we have to get there .
the access codes are in my safe .
why are they killing everyone ?
to destroy any possible threat to skynet .
which ones are the codes ?
red envelope .
crystal peak .
you have to get to crystal peak .
what is he saying ?
crystal peak .
a hardened facility in the sierra nevada mountains .
fifty two miles northeast , bearing 0 . 5 degrees .
that' s the system core ?
it' s your only chance .
you' il need a plane .
the particle accelerator leads to the runway .
take care of my daughter .
oh , katie , i am sorry .
i opened pandora' s box .
get down !
there' s nothing you can do .
come on .
we must go .
it is not safe here .
kate , we have to go .
kate !
he wanted you to come with me .
he wanted us to shut skynet down .
come on .
come on .
run !
let' s go .
that' s it .
we can follow it out to the runway .
come on .
what ?
nothing .
you remind me of my mother .
oh , god .
she' s coming .
what are you doing ?
powering up .
come on .
it' s working .
just die , you bitch !
come on .
there' s my father' s plane .
i trained on it .
yes !
he made it .
get away from me .
leave !
now !
let' s go !
the master' s on .
throttle' s set .
come on .
let' s go .
oh , please .
you can' t do this .
i have no choice .
the t x ... ... has corrupted my system .
you can' t kill a human being .
you said so yourself .
let him go !
you' re fighting it right now .
my cpu is intact .
but i cannot control my other functions .
you don' t have to do this .
you don' t want to do this !
desire is irrelevant .
i am a machine .
what is your mission ?
to ensure the survival of john connor ... ... and katherine brewster .
you are about to fail that mission !
i can ...
i cannot .
you know what you have to do .
you know my destiny .
i have to live .
are you okay ?
what happened ?
he couldn' t do it .
he shut himself down .
can you fly ?
yeah .
okay .
015 degrees ... ... 52 miles , our max air speed is about 160 .
we' ve got 32 minutes .
it' s just you and me now .
what if we can' t stop it ?
there' s enough c 4 here to take out 10 supercomputers .
we' re gonna make it , kate .
the future is up to us .
that' s gotta be it .
skynet .
there may be more of them .
come on .
i think this is some kind of blast door .
there' s no way we can blow through this thing .
john , look .
now what ?
it' s a code prompt .
type in " dakota 775 .
red 176 .
come on !
we gotta get this thing open .
here .
it' s " avalon 412 .
put it in !
come on !
i' m back .
go !
now !
come on !
thank you .
we' il meet again .
go !
come on !
you are terminated .
the elevator .
i' il set the detonator for five minutes .
that should give us enough time to get back up .
what is this place ?
these computers are 30 years old .
this isn' t skynet .
there' s nothing here .
this is a fallout shelter for vlps .
only they never got the warning .
goddamn it !
there' s nothing here !
why didn' t he tell us ?
why did he lead us down here ?
to live .
that was his mission .
there was never any stopping it .
john ... ... we could just ... ... let it go .
hello ?
hello ?
can somebody hear me ?
this is montana civil defense .
somebody please come in .
is there anybody there ?
anyone reading me ?
over .
rumors about a launch sequence .
command and control have broken down .
is anyone receiving me ?
somebody ?
somebody please come in .
anybody out there ?
this is sac nellis .
we' re under attack .
cq ?
cq ?
is anybody there ?
this is john connor at crystal peak .
connor ?
what the hell is happening ?
who' s in charge there ?
i am .
connor , can you help us ?
this is montana civil defense .
where did you say you were again ?
by the time skynet became self aware ... ... it had spread into millions of computer servers across the planet .
ordinary computers in office buildings , dorm rooms , everywhere .
it was software and cyberspace .
there was no system core .
it could not be shut down .
18 p . m . , just as he said it would .
judgment day .
the day the human race was nearly destroyed ... ... by weapons they' d built to protect themselves .
i should have realized our destiny was never to stop judgment day .
it was merely to survive it ... ... together .
the terminator knew .
he tried to tell us ... ... but i didn' t want to hear it .
maybe the future has been written .
i don' t know .
never stop fighting .
and i never will .
the battle has just begun .
