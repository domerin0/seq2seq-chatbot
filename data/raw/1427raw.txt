we' il find and rescue these little green men ... even ifwe must go to infinity and beyond .
buzz lightyear mission log .
we' ve searched this gaseous planetoid from top to bottom ... with no sign ofthe missing personnel .
hey !
come on , buddy .
nobody ever reads those reports .
warp , my friend ... procedure is what separates us from the wicked forces ofchaos .
ah , buzz , if it means less paperwork , i' il take chaos .
oh , man .
give it up , partner .
this rock' s as dead as it looks .
neverjudge a moon by its crater .
we' d better double check the dark side .
i' il drive .
well , mission accomplished .
three l. g. m. s disappeared .
wejust found three l. g. m. s .
well , i don' t think these are the three missing little green men .
sure , not any more .
i' m afraid these three are stowaways .
ah , blast !
this won' t look good in my report .
hey !
must save the lost ones !
whoa , whoa , whoa .
we' il find your amigos , boys . just not here .
here !
how can you be so sure ?
mindlink .
oh , come on !
evil !
now you' rejust trying to freak us out .
no , it' s my worst fear come true .
here we go .
this diabolical plot ... can only be the work ofthe sworn enemy ofthe galactic alliance ... evil emperor zurg !
what plot ?
you think zurg is behind every kitten stuck up a tree !
the fiend !
why can' t he leave kitty cats out of his nefarious schemes ?
all i know is we' ve searched halfofthe zeta quadrant to find the missing l. g. m. s , and what do we find ?
a lot of nothing !
there' s something really bad behind me , isn' t there ?
crater viper !
look out !
crater vipers never hunt in packs .
tell them that !
thanks , partner .
looks like this moon' s not so dead after all !
give me a minute .
it will be .
the lost ones !
what are you doing ?

warp , hit ' em from below !
soft underbellies , eh ?
let' s see how ticklish .
i should' ve guessed !
a crater viper slag monster mutant !
the l. g. m. s !
must save the lost ones .
can' t you just  warp , gemini split now !
any reason you were looking to shake hands with a beast from 20, 000 craters ?
the lost ones are there !
oh , well , then i' d say they' re the dead ones now .
let' s get out of here .
ah !
i' m goin ' in !

i hope you have a plan !

oh !
he' s not gonna like this .
anything ?

he , uh , he didn' t like it .
e evil emperor zurg !

okay , we' re getting into a chain ofcommand area here , so really
we feel the pain .
oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , right .
it' s their mindlink thing .
how do you do that anyway ?
the unimind .
unimind ?
the mystical orb that links all of l. g. m. kind .
it' s on their home world .
ofcourse , that' s need to know , classified .
i' m your partner .
i need to know .
now you do .
anything else i should know ?
no , i' d say you' re up to speed .
okay , thankyou .
tell me ofyour mindlink .
tell me your secret .
never !
oh .
i will just have to pickyour brains .
where' s my cranial dissect a bot ?
ah , lightyear .
evil emperor zurg , by the authority ofthe galactic alliance ... you are hereby charged with attempted dissection ofstar command personnel .
i shall destroy your galactic alliance .
but first , i shall destroy you !
well , not personally .
hornets , destroy buzz lightyear !
prepare to die , buzz lightyear !
not today , zurg !
hop on !
backup ?
always a dramatic entrance , warp .
let' s go after zurg !

i said , " go ! " four , three ... two , one .
space ranger warp darkmatter sacrificed himself ... for the success of his mission , for the safety of his fellows .
i miss him very much .
buzz lightyear personal log .
in his crazed attempt to destroy me ...
zurg has robbed the universe ofa good man ... my partner , my friend .
on this day i vow no ranger will ever again ... fall in harm' s way because of me .
i work alone .
commandernebula , report to training deck .
yeah , yeah , way ahead ofya .
cadet florin , watch your tail , son !
youpeople trythat kindofhot dogging in the field , andyou' re space dust !
commander nebula .
ah , lightyear .
i got something i want you to see .
allright , we' re crankin' it up to levelnine , people !

how did she do that ?
she' s from the planet tangeah .
ofcourse , tangean ghosting powers .
excellent .
yeah , let' s see one ofzurg' s robots walk through a wall .
ranger mira nova reporting for duty , sirs .
mira nova ?
strange coincidence .
isn' t that also the name ofthe heir to the tangean throne ?
i met her once .
you saved my planet once .
buzz , meet your new partner .
partner ?
sir , what you did for my people well , it inspired me tojoin .
no !
n no ?
no what ?
no partner .
too risky .
oh !
look , son , i know you' re still torn up about warp .
but next time you' re out there  and zurg aims for me ?
what' s to keep the princess from ending up like warp ?
yeah , well , maybe it' s the princess keepin ' you from endin ' up like warp .
okay , hello ?
the princess has a name !
yeah , i' m sorry , prince mira , i work alone .
so you' re gonna stop zurg all by yourself ?
that' s the general plan .
but regulations clearly state that
i know regulations !
i wrote halfofthem !
but as long as zurg is gunnin ' for me ... anybody close to me is gonna get caught in the cross fire .
noted .
but buzz , there' s one thing you should know .
yes , sir ?
you are not going out there without backup !
i' m sorry , commander , but from now on , buzz lightyear flies solo .

i wasjust , um ugh i oh , man !
just like i figured .
guess what , pal .
you' re through .
he' s not through till i say so .
captain lightyear .
buzz !
ah , space dust .
this place is filthy ... and it goes right to the subatomic level .
that' s why this young man is in here with his molecular mop .
carry on , custodian .
oh , yes , sir .
my mistake , sir .
as you were , corporal .
come on , booster .
this is the third time this week .
you know you' re really not authorized to be in here , son .
oh , i know , but i like to look at the star cruisers .
i just want to be a space ranger so bad , buzz .
now , don' t you worry .
you' il pass the entrance exam , booster .
you' vejust got to study the  space ranger mission manual ?
oh , i am , sir !
i memorize one page every night .
i' m up to section five , subsection beta .
light speed limits .
more than just a good idea , it' s the law .
outstanding .
oh , thanks , buzz .
buzzlightyearto science bay .
on my way .
gotta run , booster .
yes , sir !
uh , booster ?
yes , sir ?
at ease .
thanks , buzz .
good morning , lackeys !
where' s my new henchman ?
they are arming him now , sir .
does he have a flamethrower ?
remember last time .
a flamethrower would have really come in handy .
tension feels about right .
ah , how are his reflexes ?
not bad .
thanks .
a delightful blend of man and machine ... with just a naughty touch of lingonberry .
i shall call you agent z !
that' s stupid .
my mother used to call me that !
you know he really , really likes that name .
yes , he' s been saving it for a very evil henchman .
agent z ?
love it .
especially the whole " z " thing .
and and and you know what ?
we' il save a fortune on monogramming .
if i could just squeeze in here , yeah .
sir , your spy drone is in position .
yeah .
okay .
that' sjim crackin ' dandy !
come , agent z.
let us see if my spy drone can find this so called unimind .
the unimind !
we are one .
we are one .
i must have this mystical orb , this unimind !
launch an immediate assault on the planet ofthe little green men .
excellent .
a chance to use this .
ooh !
the flamethrower .
what' s up , fellas ?
we heard about your fight with commander nebula .
now , it wasn' t a a fight .
it wasjust a professional disagreement ... and in time , he' il admit that i' m better offalone .
we have solved your partner problem .
not you guys too .
look , i can' t have a partner problem , because i don' t have a partner .
but x. r. is perfect foryou .
x. r. ?
who' s x. r. ?
yes !
not who what .
witness the future ofspacejustice .
x. r. !
the experimental ranger .
x. r. reporting for duty .
kind ofshort , isn' t he ?
do ya think so ?
that little robot wouldn' t ... stand a chance against zurg' s forces ofevil .
watch !
you' re , uh , going somewhere with this ?
ifzurg blows up x. r.
we can put him back together .
and commander nebula approved a robot ranger ?
he hates robots .
well , he doesn' t exactly know .
he does now !
oh , hello , commander .
so you went ahead and built that expendable ranger .
uh , experimental ranger .
unauthorized ranger !
uh ... well , technically , it was authorized by you .
we slipped it in with our vacation request .
craters .
they always get me that way .
i keep tellin ' them no bucket of bolts can stand up to a real ranger .
he' s got ya there , fellas .
we thought ofthat .
artificial intelligence chip .
x. r. is programmed to watch and learn .
and he' il be learnin ' from the best you .
true .
but , uh , i don' t know .
i don' t know .
at least give him a test run as your new partner .
lightyear , i already told you !
ranger nova is your new partner .
why won' t anybody listen to me ?
no more partners !
but , buzz !
what' s eatin ' them ?
i' ve seen this before .
it' s the mindlink .
evil !
zurg !
his dark forces invade our home world !
i' m on my way .
i' m on my way .
buzz lightyear mission log .
zurg' s dark ...
shadow looms over the entire  buzz lightyear mission log .
zurg' s dark shadow looms over the
could you not do that ?
could you not do that ?
the unimind !
the unimind !
the unimind !
quickly !
we must get to the unimind !
get below !
the unimind !
the unimind !
protect the unimind !
we are one .
we are united .
we are powerful !
we are afraid !
oh , no !
hornets , move in .
at ease , little green citizens .
star command is on thejob .
yea !
at ease , little green citizens .
star command is on thejob .
our work' s not done yet , x. r. !
agent z to zurg .
they sent lightyear .
that' s whylsentyou .
craters !
a new player .
we got ' im on the run .
we' ve got him on the run ?
he' s good .
but i' m better .
x. r. !
he' s good , but i' m better .
you are learning .
now , watch this .
they never see this coming .
huh ?
saw it coming .
x. r. !
gun !
x. r. !
gun !
x. r. !
system malfunction .
agent z to zurg .
the unimind' s all yours .
you' re good , but i' m better .
the unimind !
the unimind !
buzz lightyear to star command .
this is a priority one mission update .
the unimind has been captured ... and we' ve got a ranger down .
you can fix him , right ?
can we ?
i don' t know .
we are not one .
but we shall try .
buzz lightyear personal log .
my brave little robotic partner had been blasted ... into a pile of trillium carbonic scrap .
and yet , the l. g. m. s were rebuilding him .
even without the unimind , those little green guys had the right stuff .
then came the wrong stuff .
their selection ofauxiliary gear was obviously nonregulation .
but perhaps there was a method to their madness .
maybe , just maybe .
no .
they had lost it .
wow .
they really need that uni ma call it .
i don' t think they have any idea what they' re doing any more , commander .
what is , uh , this thing ?
uh , an arm ?
told ya .
blast !
zurg knows the little green guys keep star command runnin ' !
that stinkin ' bucket head .
he did this to cripple our operation .
no , commander .
ifthat' s all zurg wanted ... he could have destroyed the unimind .
instead , he had his new lackey , agent z , steal it .
but why ?
what' s he gonna do with it ?
i don' t know exactly , but i believe that even now zurg is hatching ... his most diabolical scheme yet .
this is my most diabolical scheme yet .
assuming that the freak show , known as my staff ... can do one thing right !
ofcourse , my evil emperor , and , uh , uh ... who better to give you the good news than , uh , uh ...
brain pod percy !
i , uh , uh
okay , hi , uh , mr evil emperor .
how are you ?
uh , you look terrif very sinister today .
we believe thatjust as the unimind connected all the l. g. m. s ... uh , it could , um , hopefully allow you to reach out ... and ensnare every innocent mind in the galactic alliance .
huh ?
you know , a mind slave , evil puppet kind ofscenario .
you' re telling me my plan .
i already know my plan .
i made up the plan .
it' s my plan .
what i don' t know is how close you are to accomplishing my plan !
yeah , kind of an outdoor voice there .
okay , naturally , the first step is to turn the unimind from good to evil .
but , um , heh , we don' t have any idea how .
see , we' re on the way
lamebrain !
ifyou want something turned evil ... turn it evil yourself .
that' s what nana zurg always used to say to me ... and she was plenty evil .
evil overload !
nana zurg would be so proud .
allrangers to mission briefing room .
allrangers to mission briefing room .
hey , fellas .
something big going on ?
sorry .
can' t talk .
top secret .
oh , so , um , you guys need me to empty the , uh , wastebaskets or something ?
sorry , booster .
this is space ranger business .
yeah , space ranger business .
i don' t know what zurg' s plannin ' on doin ' with the unimind ... but i plan on beatin ' him to the punch .
we' re launching a full scale assault on planet z.
whoa !
full scale ?
buzz , listen to your trusty partner when i say ... maybe we' ve overlooked a little thing i like to call negotiation .
x. r. ?
now , follow me on this , buzz .
two words .
time share .
how many ofyou love it ?
all right .
monday through wednesday , admittedly , the galaxy belongs to zurg .
but thursday through saturday , it' s ours .
we alternate sundays .
what do you think ?
sweet mother ofvenus .
what did you do to him ?
we , uh , fixed him .
we , uh , think .
get that thing outta here !
what did i say ?
come on .
you know the time share idea is solid , and you' rejealous .
where are you guys goin ' with the robot ?
please .
experimental ranger .
uh , we were looking foryou , booster .
yeah .
we thought you could use some help .
here .
you' il love him .
i am lovable .
delta squadron will occupy zurg' s fleet ... while gamma squadron attacks planet z itself .
this is no cakewalk .
it' s a high risk operation .
uh , e excuse me , commander .
sorry to interrupt ... but i' ve been studying zurg' s planetary defence matrix .
and i think a small , one man ship
could slip past the defences unnoticed .
exactly .
a single ranger could undermine zurg' s evil operation from within .
and with the new alpha one prototype , i could slip right
wait a minute .
it was my idea .
i should go .
sorry , but you don' t have the field experience ... to take on such a dicey assignment , princess .
princess ?
i am a space ranger .
you know what ?
you two really should be partners .
' cause you' re both pigheaded show offs !
but , commander  zip it .
the alpha one is still an experimental spacecraft .
nobody' s taking it !
we' re doing this my way .
star command will launch a full assault on planet z at 0800 hours .
how long do we have to do this ?
the cafeteria' s a high traffic area .
this could take a while .
hey , here' s an idea .
we ditch work and do something fun .
no way !
i would never shirk my duty .
huh .
buzz would be very disappointed .
buzz ?
as in lightyear ?
as ifthere' s any other buzz .
you know , i used to be buzz lightyear' s partner .
get out !
that' s exactly what command nebula said .
now look at me .
hey , booster .
how would you like a v. i. p. tour of buzz lightyear' s star cruiser ?
that would be the coolest thing ever !
whoa , slim !
whoa !
i don' t know about that , but it beats working .
follow me !
space ranger buzz lightyear to mission control .
ready to launch to infinity and
oh , come on , x. r. say it with me .
what ?
oh , yeah .
to infinity and beyond !
to infinity and whatever .
beyond , yeah , right .
soon my zurgatronic megaray will be fully operational !
install the evil unimind !
now , load the crystallic fusion cell .
the zurgatronic megaray will use the unimind ... to spread my evil ... across the universe !
oh !
oh , yes !
you haven' t won until ...
lightyear is out ofthe picture .
fusion cell loaded !
fire zurgatronic megaray !
firing zurgerrific ray .
zurgatronic , ya lack wit !
sorry .
zurgerrific' s not bad , though .
let' s file it for future use .
did you make sure that the plus end went to the plus part ... and the minus end went to the minus part ?
oh !
that would do it , huh ?
oh !
alll . g. m. maintenance checkshave been cancelleduntilfurthernotice .

why , i d yes , sir .

i' m sorry .
i just wanted to help , you know ?
and i thought this would be the best way
hey , wait a minute .
what are you doing down here ?
well , l i am on a routine in inspection ofthe canooter valves .
and , uh , yep , yep , everything looks good up here .
you were about to hijack the alpha one .
oh , ofall the nerve !
report yourself to commander nebula .
mira , now is neither the time nor the place .
buzz , i just have one thing to say to you .
and what might that be ?
good night .
tangean brain squeeze .
oh !
uh oh .
who authorized that launch ?
it wasn' t us , was it ?
i know who .
it' s the princess , commander .
she stole the alpha one to take on zurg by herself .
she beat ya to it , huh ?
yeah , yeah , pretty much .
well , ranger nova is your partner .
better go get her , son .
yes , sir .
for the record , she is not my partner , sir .
whoosh !
whoosh !
look out for the asteroids , x. r.
yeah , whoosh , zoom .
whatever , booster .
sorry .
ranger lightyear .
buzz lightyear to the rescue !

roger that .
oh , come on !
whew !
he didn' t see us .
see ? just stick with x. r. and everything is a ok .
wait a minute .
zurgatronic megaray on line , evil emperor zurg .
you' re sure this time , yes ?
reasonably .
let' s test it on something before we hit star command .
we need a target that won' t , um , shoot back .
may i suggest rizone , my evil emperor ?
the planet ofthe vegetarians , yes !
delicious suggestion , uh , number , um , 29 .
eh , how long have you been with my evil organization ?
ooh , oh , let' s see , uh , in total or just since i' ve been a brain in a jar ?
uh , brain in a jar .
fouryears next week .
fascinating .
okay , then
now that you mention it .
i am overdue for a cost of living raise .
you know , when i gave up my body , certain promises were made .
i wasjust being polite !
i don' t really care , all right ?
all right .
now , unless anyone else wants ... to tell me his or her life story , can we shoot the big gun ?
rizone .
um , more salad ?
oh , i couldn' t .
well , i' m offto meditate for galactic peace .
oh , isn' t that lovely ?
i can feel it !
i control every mind on the planet !
it worked !
evil rules !
oh , this is fun !
let' s hit something else .
uh , batheous ?
the fish faces ?
test underwater effectiveness .
good point .
batheous .
another planet , and it' s mine !
i' m not the man who knows the man !
i am the man !
about that raise , sir ?
please !
once i enslave the universe , i won' t need the likes ofyou .
it' il be all zurg all the time !
24 7 !
zurgie heaven !
alpha one , powerdownyourengines .
buzz , you knowmyplan can work .
icangetpastzurg' s defences .
unfortunately , mira , the commander doesn' t agree with us .
hey , hey , hey , hey , hey !
huh ?
find anything ?
bingo .
spare space suits .
slap one on ya , jet back to star command and no one' s the wiser .
uh , x. r. ?
slight problem .
oh , come on !
end ofthe line , princess .
ease offthose thrusters , mira .
you' iljust burn ' em out .
oh , craters !
ranger nova ... that was the most outrageous showboating stunt i' ve ever seen .
kind of reminds ya ofyourself , huh ?
yeah , kind of .
this isn' t going to work .
sure it will .
come on . just suck it in .
you can do it , big fella .
think thin .
that' s the key .
uh , hello ?
all is ready , my evil emperor .
target star command and fire !
and so ends star command .
ooh , i' m so evil !
i just gave myselfchills !
even my goose bumps have goose bumps !
i' m a bad boy !
what are you doing here ?
yeah , buddy .
what are you doing here ?
we want answers and we want them now .
i meant both ofyou .
how' s that ?
it' s a complicated explanation , buzz .
i think it' s best ... wejust sweep the whole incident under the rug .
and since we' re a couple ofjanitors ...
i can promise you that' s no problem .
i' m sorry , buzz .
is that a  red alert !
hey , guys , wait up !
what was that ?
it' s headed toward star command .
well , the station looks okay .
buzz lightyear to star command .
come in , star command .
i don' t like this .
x. r. , report .
sensors indicate " spooky .
in fact , i' m going to have to go with " very spooky .
where is everyone ?
what happened ?
i mean , there' s no sign ofa struggle .
my scanner is picking up some
lightyear !
how good ofyou tojoin us .
zurg ?
in a manner ofspeaking .
ohh .
that' s spooky .
you see , i used the unimind to link your fellow rangers to my evil .
and that' sjust the beginning .
soon , the entire galactic alliance ... will be under my control .
you know , as a robot , i' m not susceptible to mind control , so this really isn' t an issue for me .
yeah , it' il be your issue when they rip you apart and sell you for scrap .
good point .
anybody got a plan ?
here' s one .
back to the ship , people !
" people " ?
that does include me , right ?
uh oh !
no , mira .
although currently possessed by the most powerful evil ... in the universe , they' re still fellow rangers .
then how do we get past them ?
looks like we' ve got us ... a high traffic area .
all right , let' s wax ' em , big guy .
just push me not so fast , not so fast , not so fast !
ya hoo !
to the launch bay !
good work , people .
and robot ?
and robot .
lightyear must not escape !
ifzurg had taken over ... every mind on star command , well ... that means we' re the only space rangers left .
what do we do ?
we' ve got to take the battle to zurg .
no need .
he' s bringing it to us .
ohh !
i got a lot of red lights blinking over here .
i don' t need those lights to tell me we' re in trouble .
i had no idea a star cruiser could pull a move like that .
and neither did zurg .
i' il make a note of it .
we' re surrounded !
you know , the guy' s supposed to be some kind ofevil genius ... and the best he can come up with is a ventriloquist act .
what' s next ?
evil juggling ?
farewell , lightyear .
they' re retreating .
but why ?
obviously , my caustic tongue cut ' em to the quick .
i' m getting a funny energy reading .
mira , check the hull .
we' ve got a bomb !
a bomb ?
perfect .
at last .
for too long , lightyear has hounded me .
but no more .
buzz lightyear mission log .
by launching the alpha one at the precise moment ofdetonation ...
zurg believes us to be destroyed .
i feel i must pause for a moment ofsilence in honour of my ship .
oh , please , buzz .
it wasjust a hunk of metal .
okay , and you are ?
in serious need ofsome personal space .
so , buzz , did zurg win ?
not a chance , booster .
i' ve got zurg right where i want him .
yeah ?
well , wherever he is , i' il bet he' s got legroom .
as long as zurg thinks i' m dead he won' t be looking for me ... and that gives me the advantage .
i never thought it would be so easy .
what ?
the defeat ofstar command ?
i always knew it was doable .
not that .
lightyear .
ah , yes , my dearly departed foe .
somehow , evil won' t be quite as much fun without buzz lightyear to kick around .
okay , ranger nova , let' s test that little theory ofyours .
so nobody' s ever actually infiltrated planet z before ?
never .
oh , man .
listen , a spacecraft this small won' t be detected .
i' m positive .
you know , i' m , i' m i' m pretty i mean , you know , i' m not a hundred percent
blast !
the seeker drones are on patrol .
oh , thisjust gets better and better .
i can do this .
i just need a little elbow room !
uh , buzz , i think i sat on a button .
what button ?
let me see .
emergency water landing .
oh , that wouldn' t be so bad ifwe were over water !
what' s gonna happen ?
first , the crystallic fusion core deactivates , and then
oh , man !
blast !
rangers , condition status .
not good .
excellent .
let' s roll .
what now ?
that ?
that' s not a spacecraft .
it' s obviously a weather balloon .
let' s leave the brain work to those with the brains , shall we ?
uh huh .
yeah .
okay .
the alpha one is a ok .
but it asks that we not do that again .
you three take the ship , find the planets that zurg hasn' t hit yet ... and supervise immediate evacuations .
what what about zurg ?
he' s my problem .
he' s everybody' s problem .
mira .
there' s only one way for me to finish this mission alone .
but buzz , that' s against the rules .
in the star command mission manual , it clearly states ... that no ranger is to go into action without backup .
i think it' s section six , subsection delta .
actually , it' s section six , subsection gamma .
he' s right , big guy .
subsection delta' s the dress code .
incidentally , why can' t we have nose rings ?
because nose rings are for punks , little mister .
well , ifyou can take on zurg alone ...
i don' t see why x. r. can' t get a nose ring .
i wasjust asking a question .
i' m not the one getting a nose ring .
then who' s getting a nose ring ?
that' s why buzz wants to ditch us !
i am not getting a nose ring .
nobody' s getting a nose ring !
it' s against the rules !
which , apparently , don' t apply to you .
ofcourse they apply to me .
the rules apply to everyone .
great .
then you' re not facing zurg alone , and we' il be your backup .
i want the three ofyou offthis planet now , and that' s an order .
yes , sir !
yes , sir !
ranger nova .
yes , sir .
thankyou .
next target , and oh .
who haven' t we perverted into a twisted reflection of my evil ?
a few planets in the beta quadrant remain unperverted .
ah , bingo !
hey !
oh !
mother of pearl !
lightyear .
zurg .
by the authority ofstar command , i hearby place you under arrest .
not bad , lightyear .
i should' ve seen that one coming .
like i was sayin ' , you' re under arrest .
aw , come on , buddy .
that' s no way to treat ... your partner .
warp ?
surprised ?
you' re alive ?
or am i dead ?
no , you' re not dead .
not yet , anyway .
but how ?
the exploding moon .
convincing , wasn' t it ?
yeah , zurg' s fireworks are really top shelf .
but , warp
agent z , please .
ofcourse !
amnesia !
no .
evil clone .
no .
android replica .
no !
okay , okay , it' s so obvious .
zurg' s mind control ray .
he got to you first .
actually , i went to him .
evil isjust so much more profitable than good , and more fun .
i don' t believe it .
the warp darkmatter ...
i trained side by side with would not work ... for the most evil force in the universe .
look , lightyear , i' ve been on zurg' s payroll since the academy .
once i got the l. g. m. s to spill the secret ofthe unimind ... the big z brought me on full time .
my name' s darkmatter .
who' s surprised here ?
one ofstar command' s finest , the perfect spy .
and i gave you a really nice eulogy .
he was not only a great ranger , but a great friend .
what a hoot !
lfonly you knew !
imisshim verymuch .
oh , one more time !
imisshim verymuch .
miss him now ?
stop mocking me !
i' il admit that in the past ... you have been a most formidable foe .
but since you lost your dear partner , you' ve been offyour game .
buzz lightyear may end today ... but what i believe in will live on hope , freedom and justice .
oh , that' s rich !
oh , please , please tell me you got that .
got it !
excellent !
add it to my collection .
besides , mr melodrama ...
i' m not going to kill you .
no .
no , i have a much more delicious idea .
i' m going to take the galaxy' s greatest hero ... and turn him into me .
welcome to the team , partner .
this isn' t my team , and you' re not my partner .
buzz lightyear mission log , final entry .
what' s he doing ?
mission log .
he' s a procedure nut .
as ifthere' s gonna be anyone left to read his report .
ooh !
sent packing like a bunch offirst year rookies .
which , technically , we are .
idon' t knowifanyone willbe left untaintedbyzurg' s evil ... to receive this last chapter .
did i sit on another button ?
it' s buzz .
aslgo to my doom ...
doom ?
ipause topaytribute to three ofthe best andthe brightest ...
to evercome out ofstarcommand .
that' s me and two others !
i have taken a one man stand against darkness and depravity .
and i have failed .
i was wrong .
keep rolling .
this is priceless .
perhaps if i had taken a new partner ... or two or three
hot rockets !
did you hear that ?
he needs us !
he actually admits he needs us .
we' re comin ' , buzz !
buzz lightyear , over and out .
target buzz lightyear .
okey doke .
you' re the evil emperor .
megaray mega ready !
do it !
hot rockets !
see , this is where metal arms come in handy .
i don' t wanna show off , but when you have to hold a heavy guy like
darkmatter , kill lightyear !
where ?
have you blown a circuit ?
aww !
stung by your own hornet , huh ?
booster !
ohh !
sorry !
target the planet ofwidows and orphans !
you fiend !
there he is !
i knew that would get him .
your puny star command laser is pathetic !
let me show you a real weapon !
oh .
nice shot .
the key is to not pull the trigger , but squeeze it .
janitor driving !
get off !
look out !
buzz is hit .
rookies .
hey , isn' t that buzz' s dead partner ?
eject !
whoa !
aren' t you thejanitor ?
yep .
oh , this is gonna be great for my rep .
mira , booster , x. r. , can anybody read me ?
do you copy ?
i can' t make it in time .
it' s up to you now .
good luck .
give it up , lightyear .
i win .
evil never wins .
afraid ofthe dark , zurg ?
not today , zurg .
evil emperor zurg , by the authority ofstar command
section five , subsection zeta .
that' s the one about the evil emperor .
you are under arrest !
like i said , evil never wins .
f firing .
hey .
you failed , lightyear !
with that final blast , i have enslaved ... every free world in the galactic alliance !
whereveryou go in the universe ... you will hear my voice mocking you !
evil rules !
oh !
we' re not done yet .
booster , x. r. , get up top and take warp into custody .
mira , you' re with me .
chain reaction !
she' s gonna blow !
get back here !
hey , release me !
hey !
i' m zurg' s number one agent !
now , there' s something i wouldn' t go boasting about .
what , you' re gonna jump ?
are you crazy ?
buddy boy , we' re on thejanitorial staff .
you' re looking at a couple of risk takers .
it' s true .
no !
don' t be such a fraidy cat .
like we' d reallyjustjump .
mm kay , buzz , what are we going to actually do ?
the l. g. m. mindlink was activated by a simple touch .
maybe , just maybe
you' re doing it !
the power of good is a strong thing , mira .
but not strong enough .
blast !
thanks to zurg , the unimind is rotten to the core .
then let' s get you to the core .
you' re gonna ghost me ?
buzz !
to infinity and beyond !
ah !
lightyear !
no !
my plan !
my galaxy !
unimind wave impact in three seconds .
curse you , buzz lightyear !
i' m going in !
he' s a goner !
thanks for the lift , mira .
anytime , sir .
i hope the unimind still works foryou guys .
we are one .
our mindlink has been restored .
all is as it was .
to infinity and beyond !
i can' t believe we captured agent z.
i can' t believe he turned out to be buzz' s dead partner who wasn' t really dead .
yeah , that too .
uh huh .
amazing !
easy , fellas .
i know i' ve exceeded all performance expectations .
it' s not that , x. r. you' re almost human .
so many character flaws !
okay .
you know what ?
let' sjust say " amazing " and leave it at that !
well , lightyear , you managed to save the universe again .
it wasn' tjust me , sir .
zurg almost won .
in fact , he would have , except i had backup .
well , ofcourse you had backup .
' cause everybody needs backup .
it' s in the manual .
section six , subsection gamma .
got the message , guys .
so , who' s your partner gonna be , son ?
don' t worry , commander .
i' ve made my choice .
