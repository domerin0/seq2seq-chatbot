now i remember a lot of stories from back in the days before i met your mother .
but there' s one story i don' t remember .
uncle marshall still refers to it as " the pineapple incident .
the night started like any other .
we were downstairs at the bar .
on the house .
it' s my own concoction .
i call it the red dragon .
wow !
thanks !
that was really sweet .
we' re not really doing shotre we ?
i hope not .
these look kind of like blood .
okay , i know that you' ve all dismissed this theory before .
but is there any chance that carl is a vampire ?
no , you guys , i' m serious .
think about it .
he always wears black .
we never see him in the daylight , only after dark .
oh , my god .
that does describe a vampire ... or , you know , a bartender .
i should go get dressed .
where you going , buddy ?
hot date ?
i' il say .
she' s going out with a billionaire .
lily , i told you not to call him that .
wait , you' re really going out with a billionaire ?
he' s not a billionaire .
he' s a hundred millionaire .
why do people always round up ?
so , uh , where' s thurston howell taking you ?
a charity dinner .
yeah , $2, 000 a plate . $1, 500 .
stop rounding up .
and it' s for third world hunger .
you gonna put out ?
what ?
there' s only one reason he' s taking her to this dinner , and it' s not so little mutu can get his malaria pills .
i think my soul just threw up a little bit .
well , i' m gonna be late .
you guys have fun .
bye .
see ya .
bye .
see ya .
you okay ?
sure .
why ?
oh , i don' t know .
girl of your dreams dating a billionaire .
okay , first of all , hundred millionaire .
and second , she' s not the girl of my dreams .
we' re just friends .
look , it would not be smart if we got together .
i mean , i' m looking to settle down , she' s looking for ...
wha ... ?
you done ?
great .
check out table number four .
see that little hottie on the end ?
she' s short , but has an ample bosom .
i love it .
she' s , like , half boob .
let' s go .
yeah , and say what ?
what' s our big opening line ?
i ... uh ...
daddy' s home .
daddy' s home ?
okay , you want us to go over there right now and say to those girls , " daddy' s home " ?
really think about that , barney .
yeah , i think it' s pretty solid .
okay , think about this .
is there even a single item on the menu that has garlic in it ?
garlic fries .
okay , well , i' il get back to you .
oh , daddy' s back .
see , if you' d taken a moment to think about that ...
then daddy wouldn' t have gotten this seven digit father' s date card from amy .
that worked ?
i hate the world .
ted , your problem is all you do is think , think , think .
i' m teaching you how to do , do , do .
doo doo .
totally .
so i think a lot .
i happen to have a very powerful brain .
it can' t be helped .
oh , yes , it can .
interesting .
ted , i believe you and i met for a reason .
it' s like the universe was saying , " hey , barney , there' s this dude he' s pretty cool but it' s your job to make him awesome .
your brain screws you up , ted .
it gets in the way .
it happened with robin , it happened with half boob , and it' s gonna keep on happening until you power down that bucket of neuroses inibriation style .
so , what , you want me to do a shot ?
oh , no .
i want you to do five shots .
more interesting .
barney , i think you' ve officially ...
no , don' t think .
do .
ted , he' s right : you overthink .
maybe you should overdrink .
drink , drink ...
drink , drink , drink ...
uh , lily , will you tell these guys how stupid they' re being ?
guys , you are being immature and moronic , and drink , drink ...
drink , drink , drink ...
yeah !
drink , drink , drink ...
let me tell you something about this dream , okay ?
drink !
pure alcohol cannot stop this brain .
drink , drink , drink ...
i love it !
i love it !
i love it !
this brain , dear mortals , is no ordinary brain .
drink , drink , drink ...
this is a super brain .
drink , drink , drink ...
this brain is unstoppable .
this brain ...
and that' s all i remember .
except for a few hazy memories .
but really , the next thing i remember was waking up the following morning .
so there were some unanswered questions .
how much did i drink ?
how did i sprain my ankle ?
and who was this girl in my bed ?
there' s our rock star .
okay , uh ...
what the hell happened last night ?
you really don' t remember , superbrain ?
so uncle marshall and aunt lilly filled me in .
and how did you guys like the shots ?
i drank all five , bitch .
i love drunk ted .
marshall thinks you' re a vampire .
if he pukes , one of you guys cleans it up .
no dibs .
no d ...
damn it !
how quickly you all forget .
i haven' t puked since high school .
i am vomit free since ' 93 .
vomit free since ' 93 .
that' s funny .
i' m funny !
who are you calling ?
robin .
oh , bad idea jeans .
no , no , it' s a great idea .
that' s the whole point of getting drunk .
you do things you' d never do if you were sober .
says every girl you' ve ever slept with .
say what ?
hello , robin .
it' s ted .
oh , hi , ted .
hello , robin .
it' s ted .
hi , ted .
sounds like you' re having fun .
robin , have i ever told you that i am vomit free since ' 93 ?
listen , ted , i can' t really talk right ...
' 93 ?
dude , that' s impressive .
robin , i don' t say this enough , but you' re a great woman , and a great reporter .
you should be on 60 minutes .
you should be one of the minutes .
that' s sweet ... and odd .
but i' m kind of on a date right now .
yeah , and i disagree with barney .
just ' cause this guy' s spending a lot of money doesn' t mean you have to put out .
take it slow , robin .
take it slow .
slow ...
bye , ted .
slow ...
wow , right .
that' s why we don' t do shots .
friends don' t let friends drink and dial .
i need that phone back .
you' il get this back at the end of class .
ding .
class dismissed .
here you go , kid .
you call whoever you want .
thank you , kind sir .
at least someone appreciates the fact that i am doing and not thinking .
and now , i don' t think i won' t not go to the bathroom .
was that necessary ?
he is not making smart decisions .
exactly .
it' s like , what' s he gonna do next ?
i don' t know , but i want to find out .
cheap trick ?
oh , ted .
hello again , ted .
# hey , it' s me again #
# plain to see again #
# please , can i see you every day #
i love everyone in this bar !
we love you , drunk ted !
# i' m a fool again #
# i fell in lo ... #
ted ?
well , that explains the ankle .
then we brought you home and put you to bed .
was there anyone else in there with me ?
there' s a girl in there !
i know .
and a pineapple .
i know .
who is she ?
i don' t know .
what the hell happened to my jacket ?
whoa .
that girl in there is alive , right ?
i should call barney .
maybe he knows what happened .
hello .
why are you sleeping in our tub ?
uh , the porcelain keeps the suit from wrinkling .
wait , were you here when i went to the bathroom in the middle of the night ?
don' t worry .
i slept through it .
i totally didn' t sleep through it .
oh , and wow , for a little girl , you got a big tank .
how did you get in here anyway ?
we put ted to bed around 1 : 00 .
oh , you put ted to bed , all right .
you guys take care of me .
you guys are the best .
i love you guys so much .
good night , ted .
love you , too , buddy .
i' m back , baby doll !
hey !
hey !
hey !
he rallies !
and the night begins now !
all right .
game face on .
carl , two more .
all right , what do we think of this one ?
i think she ...
trick question .
no thinking .
you know what time it is ?
it' s do o' clock .
let' s ride .
bring it !
hi .
have you met ted ?
excuse me .
you' re calling robin .
i' m calling robin .
ted , as your mentor and spiritual guide , i forbid you from calling her .
oh , yeah ?
what you gonna do ?
if you complete that call , i will set your coat on fire .
you' re bluffing .
hello , robin .
it' s ted .
ted , for the last time , stop ...
ow !
ted ?
you set me on fire .
real suede wouldn' t have gone up so fast .
you got robbed .
this is a blend .
you set me on fire .
and who' s the girl in my bed ?
there' s a girl in your bed .
and a pineapple .
am i the only one who' s curious about the pineapple ?
who is she ?
i have no idea .
nice .
you really don' t know who that is ?
no .
after i hosed you down with the beverage gun , i brought you back here .
i better not have gotten burned .
did any of you write that ?
hi .
i' m ted .
if lost , please call ...
whose number is that ?
i don' t know .
dude , call it .
ooh , hold on , i' m gonna make some popcorn .
ooh .
okay , you can call now .
god , this is intense .
i love it .
hello ?
uh ... hi .
who' s this ?
you called me .
who' s this ?
it' s ted .
it' s carl from the bar .
and then carl filled us in .
barney , you' ve always taken care of me .
you are a gentlemen and a scholar .
go into my stable and take my finest stallion .
he' s yours .
his name is windjammer .
sleep it off , bro .
i' m back , baby doll !
yeah .
and i ... am gonna throw up .
i threw up ?
oh , my streak is over .
vomit free since ' 05 doesn' t sound good .
sorry , carl .
go on .
carl ... did you know the word " karaoke " is japanese for " empty orchestra " ?
isn' t that hauntingly beautiful ?
are you a vampire ?
all right , i' m cutting you off .
go home and get some sleep , ted .
yeah , the sun' s gonna come up soon .
wouldn' t want to be around for that , would we ?
hey , how easy do you think it would be to sneak into the zoo ?
i have to see some penguins , like , right now .
all right , give me your arm .
okay .
this way , if you pass out in the gutter ...
it tickles . ... someone will call me , and i will come get you .
thanks , carl .
we can' t just be friends .
we' re attracted to each other , and we both know it .
excuse me ?
me and robin , me and robin .
i have to make one more call .
yeah , this' il go good .
hey , it' s me again .
look , who are we kidding ?
you and i are both attracted to each other .
we' re young , we' re drunk half of us anyway and we only get one life .
so , why don' t you come over to my apartment right now , and we' il think of something stupid to do together ?
really ?
great .
wait .
really ?
great .
thanks , carl .
it' s robin .
that' s robin in there .
did you guys ... ?
oh , come on .
you' ve got to give me this one .
those five shots got you further with robin than your brain ever did .
see what happens when you don' t think ?
you do .
more importantly , you do robin .
come on .
all right , right over here .
but , uh , still , what does this mean ?
are we dating now ?
i i mean , i never pictured it going down this way , but ... maybe that' s how it had to happen .
i mean , think about it ...
someone get him a shot .
he' s thinking again .
you know what ?
hold on , man .
maybe it' s not such a bad idea to think about this one .
you and robin went down this road before .
you got dinged up really bad .
you know who might have something to say about ted' s future with robin ?
robin .
go wake her up .
wake her up and say what ?
daddy' s home .
good luck , buddy .
hello .
ted , it' s robin .
are you sure ?
hey , robin , how are you ?
ted , i think you and i should have a talk about those phone calls last night .
do you mind if i swing by ?
ask her about the pineapple .
uh , yeah , sure , come on over .
thanks .
no .
wait , d d don' t come ...
she' s coming over .
crap !
wait .
this is killing me .
we have to find out who that girl is .
trudy .
my name is trudy .
and then , trudy filled us in .
i' m just surprised you didn' t dump him sooner .
i know .
it' s two years of my life i' m never getting back .
a little part of me wants to just jump the bones of the next guy i see .
daddy' s home .
or the one after that .
okay , fair enough .
i' ve got to prove a point to a friend , so , you just gave me your number ... and your name is amy .
ladies .
i love everyone in this bar !
look at that idiot go .
he' s kind of cute .
what are you doing in the men' s room ?
what am i doing in the ladies ' room ?
all right , i came in here , ' cause i thought i was gonna throw up .
did you ?
i did not .
and the streak continues vomit free since ' 93 .
i' m sorry , trudy .
go on .
i liked your performance .
what , the karaoke ?
domo arigato .
i wish i had your guts .
getting up and making a complete idiot of myself .
so , do it .
i don' t know .
still , i' ve had a pretty serious week .
i could sure stand to do something stupid .
i' m something stupid .
do me .
you' re funny .
hey , can i call you sometime ?
okay .
here , let me .
why do they call it karaoke , anyhow ?
was it invented by a woman named carrie okey ?
these are the kinds of things i think about .
karaoke is japanese for " empty orchestra .
that' s hauntingly beautiful .
hey , it works .
then i guess you' re gonna have to call me .
i got to make one more call .
hello ?
hey , it' s me again .
hey .
look , who are we kidding ?
you and i are both attracted to each other .
we' re we' re young , we' re drunk half of us , anyway and we only get one life .
so , i came over here .
and now , i' m really , really embarrassed .
damn it , trudy !
what about the pineapple ?
sorry .
sorry .
sorry !
ah , robin' s here .
um , look , trudy , i need you to hide in my bedroom .
why ?
is that your girlfriend ?
ah , no , that' s not my girlfriend .
um , look , it' s complicated .
oh , you' re married .
yeah , i know .
i can' t believe i did this .
no , no , no , i i' m not married .
um ...
i' il explain after you hide .
hey .
hi , guys .
hey , robin , top of the morning .
hi , robin .
good sweater .
um , sorry i kept calling you like that .
i was pretty drunk .
uh , no kidding .
those calls were really weird .
look , ted , maybe we need to talk .
let' s go get a snack .
i love to snack .
i' m good .
come on , those calls weren' t that weird .
robin !
come hang out !
okay , i' m gonna make this sound till you come hang out .
that goes on for three and a half minutes .
without a breath ?
that' s got to be some kind of record .
oh , ted , you can' t do this .
please .
we agreed to be friends , and now you' re making it all confusing .
no , i' m not .
look , i i just turned off my brain for the night .
nothing' s changed .
you' ve moved on .
i' ve moved on .
really ?
you' ve moved on ?
yes .
what , you don' t believe me ?
oh .
uh , okay .
trudy , come on out .
you are gonna laugh .
wait .
you were with someone last night ?
yeah , trudy .
she' s cool .
trudy , come on out .
yeah , seriously , it' s okay .
this is so trudy .
she' s really shy ...
i think .
trudy ?
hi , trudy .
i' m robin .
it' s nice to meet you .
you' re right .
she is shy .
i' m not making this up .
she she must have climbed out the fire escape .
whatever .
whatever !
i i don' t care what you think .
then why' d you hide her from me ?
wow .
you' re good .
anyone ever tell you you should be on 60 minutes ?
yes .
you did ... last night .
really ?
get some sleep , ted .
you had a long night .
and don' t feel bad .
i' ve woken up with worse .
i left trudy a message , but she never called me back .
that' s just how life works sometimes .
you turn off your brain for a night , and all your left with the next day is a bad hangover , a sprained ankle ...
oh , we never found out where that pineapple came from , but it was delicious .
