i don' t have a million dollars , you know .
it' s not a big issue for me now .
i' m sorry .
what is that ? .
so you can buy a lottery ticket .
lcok , i don' t need your pity .
i wasn' t  really .

come on , man .
fuck .
ahh !
lcok , man .
bull' s eye .
i didn' t come here forthis .
okay , boss , this is a job that we gotta do in the day
' cause they' re not gonna expect us .
especially two humans ,
' cause they' re usually guarding against vampires .
one and a half humans .
okay , you got jokes .
this is a diagram of how it' s gonna get down .
this is the front gate .
this is where the first guard is .
afterthe first guard , there' s gonna be two more .
how we get past the first guard ?
let me finish .
once we get past these two guards here , we head to this little room .
thats where the safe is .
there might be one guard there .
i don' t know .
after we get pa
when we get to the timer , we have about 60 seconds .
afterthem 60 seconds , if we take tco long , it' il alert more , so you have to be quick .
how do we get past the first guard ?
tear gas .
sounds like a fuckin ' deathtrap .
thats what it is , man .
lf we use tear gas , the whole rest of the block is gonna swarm down on us .
neverthought of that one .
how are you so sure that there' s three to four pecple inside ?
possibly .
how do you know this ?
this is what i scoped out three weeks ago .
after we get past the first guard , you don' t think the rest will just rush to the froht ? .
i didn' t think of that one right there .
escape route ?
the front dcor .
so there' s no escape route .
not that i know of .
no .
i think you need to leave the plannin ' to me and ...
just let me be the boss .
okay .
' cause you don' t know what the fuck you' re doin ' .
tend to your business , boss .
first rule ... is if we walk there and the shit dcesn' t lcok right , we leave immediately .

second rule is no guns .
what the fuck you mean , " no guns " ?
how we supposed to get past fourto five guards with no guns ?
