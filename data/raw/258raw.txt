the mexican cartels have 1, 500 miles of border between them and the greatest drug consuming nation on earth ... ... separated by a 15 foot high fence which starts at the pacific ocean and travels the distance of four states .
they flood our streets , day after day , week after week , at an average of 20 tons a month .
that' s enough to provide a line of cocaine for every man , woman , and child on this planet .
yeah ?
it' s me .
what' s up ?
i' ve got tickets to the tuesday game .
is that right ?
row 10 , seat 14 .
14 ?
oh , i' m with that !
i' il see you there .
from 10 tons a week ago in colombia to one bump tonight in l. a. , worlds away from the men who run the whole goddamned show .
and remember , no one must make all the arrests .
we book them downtown , and the extradition will take place from there .
are we clear ?
we' re clear that you wouldn' t be going in there without us .
you heard the man .
let' s get ready to move .
demetrius , let' s have the gun .
est loco .
you gotta be kidding me , frost .
we are on their turf .
isn' t that right , sean ?
come on .
memo lucero was a colombian who saw opportunity in mexico' s northern border towns .
he set up shop in tijuana and built the busiest , most lucrative drug pipeline the world has ever seen .
lucero never slept in the same place twice , so no one ever knew where he was .
but after seven years , we finally tracked him down .
let' s go .
frost , this is stupid .
they call us down here .
they take away our weapons ?
they expect us to go into a building full of drunken cartel gunmen unarmed ?
i mean , that isn' t fun .
you' re not getting paid to have fun .
good luck , gentlemen .
bureaucrats !
ay , chingado .
all right .
stay down !
shit !
you have no idea what kind of mistake you' re making .
put your hands up !
things are only gonna get worse , for all of us .
do me a favor and shut the fuck up !
come on .
boss , let me go home and see my wife .
i' il think about it .
i can' t go home and see my wife ?
i' il think about it !
get out of here , you knucklehead !
hey !
good job !
damn right , good job !
seven years , dog !
we got him !
where are you ?
honey , i' m still down here .
are you okay ?
yeah , i' m okay .
it was a little crazy , but i' il be home tomorrow or the next day .
right .
baby ... ... what are you wearing ?
one of your old jerseys .
not that blue one that you look incredibly sexy in .
yeah , the one that smells like you .
is that a good thing ?
it' s a great thing .
what are you doing right now ?
making candles .
is that pine or evergreen ?
sean !
it' s my favorite one .
of course it is .
oh , i miss you !
two months ago , with the arrest of memo lucero , we finally dealt the pacific corridor its first substantial blow .
we didn' t talk like cops , we didn' t look like cops , we didn' t act like cops .
for that matter , we never hung out with them , either .
we had an edge that came from growing up on the streets .
that' s why were the most successful anti narcotics crew in law enforcement .
we made the dent that the naysayers said we couldn' t make .
from this day forward , things will be different .
by taking out lucero , we have cut the head off the dragon .
and now we are sending an emphatic message to anyone out there who may have designs on filling the void left by memo lucero .
the cartels know now that the u. s. will not stand by idly while they pollute our shores with their narcotics .
what' s happening , homes ?
peace will be restored , and the flow of cocaine will stop .
i' m happy to announce that , effective today , their business in southern california is over .
to the men and women of our undercover units , enjoy the accolades , because you' ve certainly earned them .
they want to play in a tournament .
they want to ball against us , dog .
against who ?
ramon cardena was killed yesterday .
who , lucero' s guy ?
yeah , state' s attorney' s .
i' m not gonna shed any tears over it , but i am concerned about one thing ... this could get a little bit messy .
frost , this is for you .
it' s eucalyptus , for enlightenment .
enlightenment ?
baby , he' s a senior citizen .
give him the viagra candle .
sean !
big sexy !
what' s up , dog ?
what did i tell you about smoking ?
i got you , dog .
you don' t want me to put you in the sleeper hold .
what' s up with all these damn narc cars out here ?
is this a police convention ?
supposed to be a damn barbecue , dog .
believe me , you' re cool here .
you' re with me .
it' s my house .
i sure hope it' s cool to go through .

amen .
that' s what i' m talking about .
now , i' m sure that my man sean feels the same way , right ?
yes .

the second move ...
the second big move is to flood the whole entire west coast with more coke than we' ve ever seen before in a straight up hostile takeover .
if that happens , we' re right back where we started .
we shouldn' t have gone to mexico .
we can do this .
we can shut them down before they become the next dominant cartel .

from the wreckage , officials believe the gunmen attacked with semiautomatic weapons , killing two bureau of prisons officers and injuring several others .
the specifics are being withheld until the investigation is complete , but we believe that the gunmen were able to spring cartel leader memo lucero , who was serving two life sentences for a string of murders and trafficking of narcotics .
the prisoner was being transferred to a maximum security prison outside l. a.
i signed the transfer .
it is not your fault that lucero busted out , okay ?
yeah , but i recommended it .
they say he' s somewhere in mexico , man .
he' s not in mexico , demetrius .
how do you know that ?
i' m taking frost' s advice .
i' m taking a little time .
sean , where you at ?
don' t worry .
i' m in a good place .
i' m recovering .
just give me a call soon , all right ?
okay .
this will only take a second .
i got all the time in the world .
i tracked you for seven years .
you never went to the same place twice .
until you came home .
i told you you had no idea what you were getting yourself into .
if you' d stayed out of my business , your wife would still be alive .
your arrogance killed her , not me .
like your arrogance coming here !
do you think you can come into my domain and kill me ?
if i wanted you dead , you would be .
finish the job .
i know that you' re with me in spirit .
but i still miss you .
you okay ?
who picked the stone ?
we all did .
yeah , she would have liked that .
