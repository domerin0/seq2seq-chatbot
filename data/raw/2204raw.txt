i' m not saying that we' re any better than you , but really ...
you can have the sick one .

final offer .
it' s a disgrace .
twins belong together .

we' re going to get lotje well again .
lotte is going to be well cared for in her new country .

when is lotte coming ?
when you' ve finished .

not all in one go .
lotte won' t be coming .
she has consumption .
so that' s that .

she' s not alive anymore .
just like your mummy .
and now i' m your new mummy .
give me that handkerchief .
you know these words , don' t you ?
handkerchief ?
mummy ?

they are dutch words .

dear lotte , when are you coming ?
what are you writing ?
a letter .
to whom ?
lotte .
and where will you send it to ?
holland .
do you know the address ?
she thinks we know the address .
we don' t have the address either .
they don' t want us to know it .
afraid we' il drop by .
stuck up lot .
maybe lotte will write to you .
lf she' s still alive .
dear anna .
tomorrow i will get on the train and come to you .
tomorrow i will be with you again .
you' il never guess what delicious things i' ve got here .
that' s good .
write a nice letter to your sister .
later .
after your meal .
dinand ?
we have to decide now .
do we send it ?
and then ?
she' il want to go there when she' s better .
and then they' il keep her .
i can' t bear to see it .
they' re barbarians , jetje .
stupid farmers .
stupid , catholic farmers .
do you want her to grow up there ?
no .
she has to forget anna .
believe me , jetje .
for her own good .
she simply has to forget anna .
why is there no letter ?
harder .
no .
because there won' t be a letter .
why not ?
i' il tell you some day .
go on .
no .
lotte doesn' t want anything to do with you .
she thinks you' re stupid and dirty .
and besides , she' s dead .
sweetie ...
did something make you call out for anna ?
shall i tell you about anna ?
you understand me perfectly , don' t you ?
clever little girl .
anna is living with the barbarians .
they are really stupid people who have no stationery ... and that' s why there is never a letter .
but not to worry .
anna is very happy with the barbarians .
she likes it there .
with all the animals ...
and she wants lotte to be happy , too .
anna doesn' t want lotte to cry .
you have to go to sleep now .
sleep well .
sleep well .
sleep well , anna .
what is it now ?
what do you want ?
i want to have a bath .
what' s with the girl ?
i want to have a bath .
ls she getting milk ?
the milk is to sell .
and why don' t i see her in school ?
really ?
she doesn' t seem that way to me .
ln fact , she seems rather clever .
what is it ?
' the grace of help is a supernatural assistance ... through which god lightens our understanding and moves us ... to shun evil and do good . '
i want to go to school .
you' re coming with me .
my hands , you see .
i don' t play the piano any more .
both hands ?
only the right .
arm and hand .
i have everything low in the kitchen .
but other than that ...
my biggest passion was gardening .
now , my grandson comes and weeds for me .
that' s nice too .
we just have to make the best of it .
i' il see you tomorrow .
what' s wrong with you ?
arthritis ?
me , too .
i have that , too .
it runs in our family .
oh , well .
not in mine .
yes , it does .
it does .
it certainly does .
lottchen .
why are you looking in the mirror ?
your father had consumption .
so did your sister .
and your mother had cancer .
but i' m still alive .
our lord , the most splendid of all so gentle and so kind beautiful lips
our lot has been on the radio twice already .
with a choir .
purposeful and determined
like there in the blue depths bright and shiny , every star
our lord , in my heaven
it' s not about you , you know .
sing , sing .
third year conservatory .
i' m a rotten player .
go on .
the farmer who marries you ...
does not exist .
oh no ?
no .
i won' t marry a farmer .
i won' t be a farmer' s wife .
what then ?
i want to go to school and then to university .
go to the blacksmith .
we' re busy .
busy ?
do i have to go myself ?
you have a beautiful voice .
are you coming to the conservatory ?
no , i' m going to study german .
pity .
why ?
why german ?
i think german is a beautiful language .
are you the milkman' s ?
you don' t look like your sisters at all .
yet they' re sisters all the same .
lmagine .
you' re much more beautiful .
the axle of our hay cart . ls it ready ?
not yet .
what are you doing ?
he looks like he wants to fight .
he does .
fight for us .
for all of us .
against unemployment and against poverty .
that man has big plans for us .
it' s incredible ... that this hitler , this mudslinger , is so successful .
germany , germany ...
it' s in the papers every day .
i' m sick of it sometimes .
our bram has just returned from germany .
oh really ?
yes .
a born raconteur , my brother .
they said that you had to go to germany for proper training in violin making .
and ?
he was back after fourteen days , devastated .
why ?
oh , i don' t know ...
i can listen to him for hours .
tell us , go on .
it' s just not easy to get a position there .
for jews , he means .
he was given the cold shoulder everywhere he went .
we' re no longer welcome there .
oh , you shouldn' t take those nazis too seriously , you know .
we belong to the first class , did you know that ?
farmers belong to the first class .
lf he succeeds , everything will be better .
then you can take on a workman and i can go to school .
who gave you this paper ?
bernd miler .
he told me all this .
bernd miler is an idiot .
we are catholics .
adolf hitler is fighting for us .
it says so right there .
you' il get a workman , i' il go to school .
never let me catch you near that boy .
why ?
i only want to go to school .
never let me catch you near that bastard , you hear me ?
so that' s how they do it .
enlisting young people .
ldiots .
bunch of sheep .
and you' re falling for this as well .
never again , do you hear ?
lf i ever catch you near that stupid ass ...
let them talk , ignorant farmers .
your uncle is an ignorant farmer .
obedient catholics .
they don' t know any better .
like animals who have lived too long in a cage .
open the door and they stay inside .
what has the church ever done for us ?
do you want to spend the rest of your life in filth ?
we' il do it differently .
lf there were more women like you we' d have the new germany in no time .
well , what do you think ?
nice .
i' ve joined , anna .
a new order , and i' m part of it .
you should join as well .
yes .
do you want to make me happy ?
and germany ?
and our fhrer ?
i want to go to grammar school .
i' il build you a house .
with a gable roof .
and shutters .
a bavarian veranda .
and a solid oak door .
i have to go home .
they don' t know where i am .
and there' s a storm coming .
heinrich , come here .
anna kissed him .
would you have dared if your father were still alive ?
would you ?
would you have dared if your father were still alive ?
come here , you .
answer me .
what' s wrong ?
separating twins ... what an idea .
it' s just criminal .
i' ve written so many letters .
sitting up in my bed ...
' anna , where are you .
anna , write back .
anna , anna , anna ... '
but she never replied .
i talked to her in my head .
they thought i was a quiet child , but i was talking all day .
like this i can see both of you .
but which one is anna ?
why don' t you visit her ?
she never gave me a sign she was alive .
shall i go with you ?
i' il go with you .
david , you cannot talk about this .
we never talk about it at home .
why not ?
i told you .
now you must forget it again .
that does it .
i' m taking you away from here .
st. joseph' s domestic science school
that cupboard on monday morning , i told you .
the outside only .
and the floor ?
i wanted to do that later .
come here , girl .
i check everything myself , like this .
there can be no dust , no dirt anywhere .
so no rest until all the dirt is gone .
it' s a struggle .
dust plagues our lives .
and don' t forget the portrait of our fhrer .
i can' t find it .
schumann .
higher , i think .
that' s not very gentlemanly .
no , it' s not .
what is that ?
it' s cruel .
all those letters .
my sister .
how could you ?
something so terrible .
you don' t know what you' re talking about .
where are her letters ?
or did you throw them away ?
no , darling .
no ...
give me those letters then .
no letter ever came .
why not ?
did she know where i lived ?
all that time she was waiting for a letter from me ?
who would do such a thing ?
why ?
explain it to me .
we saved you from a bunch of illiterate barbarians .
why didn' t you save her then ?
you were sick .
and if you had gone to visit anna , they would have kept you there .
your life wouldn' t have been as nice .
i would have still had my sister .
you would now both be marching behind mr hitler , waving flags .
does she still live there ?
with the barbarians ?
why ?
because i' m going to her .
you don' t always have to spend your evening off in your room .
i don' t mind .
come and join us .
take a seat .
of course we' re not going to just sit here .
every young woman should master that .
go on .
herr stolz ?
do you think i could read a book ?
of course .
do you have any preferences ?
the sorrows of young werther .
goethe ?
but that' s far too difficult .
have you read it ?
no , but ...
well , then let her .
nowadays , culture belongs to everyone .
hereditary health department .
could we have a word with you ?
according to our information , you have a servant called anna bamberg .
may we come in ?
what about anna bamberg ?
as you know , anna bamberg is mentally retarded .
she looks quite normal , i thought .
yes , yes .
that' s not unusual .
but these papers leave no doubts .
what do you want from her ?
you know the government is looking to solve the problem of retarded people ?
it has been decided that anna bamberg is to be sterilized .
sterilized ?
such things are hereditary , madam .
surely you know that .
anna bamberg , retarded ?
it' s right here in the guardianship deed .
' anna bamberg , foster daughter of heinrich and martha , is retarded ... and too delicate of health to be educated .
she is so weak ... '
that they had to keep her home from school .
and so on .
read for yourself .
he was paid ?
she' s right in front of you , anna bamberg .
i' m the delicate , retarded girl you' re looking for .
i could read and write when i was six years old .
my uncle kept me home to work for him for free .
he allowed his wife to terrorize me , he beat me up .
and no one ...
no one ever came to check whether what he' d written was true .
and now you' re going to sterilize me ?
i' ve had quite enough of this .
out .
get out .
don' t you worry .
i won' t break any more of your vases .
you know what your problem is ?
you have ideas above your station .
good luck .
you' re a servant and you always will be .
my dear sister .
this is my first letter to you , but also my hundredth .
i' m writing this with thumping heart , because i think , dear anna ... that we will see each other again soon .
i have found you .
so you' re still alive .
lotte ...
what a surprise .
i' ve asked myself a hundred times why you didn' t write .
we were both lied to .
your letter took five weeks to get here .
dear anna , do you know where you' re going yet ?
i' m tutoring in german .
i have nearly enough for the trip .
will you write to me ?
dear lotte .
your letter came yesterday , after eight weeks .
it was opened at customs .
i have a new position .
near cologne , with a countess .
we live in a villa with a swimming pool .
can you imagine ?
the countess is a beautiful woman .
and she smells so nice , of powder and cigarettes .
are you coming soon ?
i' ve gone ahead and bought one .
i have to go to the station .
today ?
that' s completely impossible .
but i told you .
my sister .
not now .
i can' t do without you .
you' re the only one who keeps her head .
but you promised .
careful with the chandelier .
please .
oh , dear ...
how will you get to the station ?
gnther .
hermann , take over from him .
but quickly .
hurry .
do you remember me ?
everything .
your eyebrows ...
everything .
your eyes .
daddy' s eyes .
this car belongs to the countess .
everyone else' s cars are commandeered .
nice car .
you can only stay one night .
i couldn' t reach you .
everything has changed again .
we' re heading east .
the countess is afraid .
afraid that the english will start bombing us .
there she is .
charlotte von garlitz dublow , countess of falkenau .
they have an old castle on the oder .
that' s where we' re going .
beautiful , isn' t she ?
ls this all right ?
when do you have to leave ?
tomorrow morning .
the countess can' t do without me .
tomorrow ?
yes .
pity .
the war ...
i have to go downstairs .
what about me ?

i' il help you .

you' il find out what a proper maid' s life is like .
you' re like a board .
as straight as an arrow .

why are they here ?
they' re on leave .
guests of the count .
hannele .
my sister .
my sister lotte .
i don' t know what it' s like there or how long we' il stay .
it' s madness , but we' re taking everything with us .
the whole family is dining here .
plus spouses and children .
the officers ... the guests ...
let me think ...
who is serving ?
we used to have the same glasses .
hannele and l .
and lotte .
hermann will pour the wine .

what' s it like , university ?
oh , nice .
but i don' t study enough .
i much prefer singing .
i' ve got an accompanist at the moment .
i can play , but he' s much better .

a very nice boy .
do you want to know a secret ?
we' re going to get engaged .
anna , dear anna .
what would i do without you ?
engaged ?
really ?
tell me about it .
when are you finished ?
ls it the champagne , or are there more maids here ?
for the jews live shamelessly in our german fatherland soldiers , comrades put the jews against the wall when the soldier goes into battle he is in high spirits with the jew' s blood dripping from his knife , things look even better for we are going into battle for we are going into battle against england , england
our side has suffered the first casualty .
this is the hardest i' ve ever worked .
do you want to stay here ?
why ?
you can come with me to holland .
there is no war there .
and i' m sure my ... mother would be pleased .
go with you to holland ...
i don' t have anything for you .
that many ?
you don' t have to read them now .
silly children' s letters .
lf i had received all those letters ...
remember this ?
mum' s .
now you can have it for a while .
she couldn' t embroider .
what are they doing ?
why are they doing that ?
they' ve gone mad .
anna , you have to leave .
you can' t stay here .
come with me .
come with me to holland .
please .
why not ?
i can' t abandon the countess right now .
she was so kind to me .
two weeks .
three , at the most .
until we settle in there .
then i' il come .
two weeks ...
i don' t understand .
i couldn' t stick it here for another day .
until we' ve settled in .
then i' il come .
why can' t you decide for yourself ?
forty five rooms .
