sounds like a bomb to me .
the paper said it was electrical .
it was an accident .
that' s bullshit .
someone' s covering something up .
that was no accident .
it was set , man .
why ?
paul wasn' t hated by anybody in the world .
what about when you went out ?
did he say anything ?
well , he was upset .
he thought people were following him .
yeah ?
who ?
he didn' t know
demons .
demons ?

he was seeing things
coming out of the woodwork .
they' re trying to get me , " he said .
did he say what they were ?
excuse me .
in one end and out the other , huh , george ?
still a fucking spaz .
hope he can hold his dick better than he can his bottle .

something weird is going on here .
paul isn' t the first one who' s died .

his car blew up , too .
dr. carlson' s dead ?
yeah .
an explosion just like paul' s .
we got six guys here going fucking crazy .
well , not me , buddy .
ok , but the rest of us are going crazy .
think this has something to do with that night ?
it' s got something to do with something .
we have to go see the army .
they' re not telling us something .
oh , come on , professor .
what makes you think the army' s going to give you any answers ?
you' il be butting up against a brick wall .
we' il get a lawyer .
you should find yourself a shrink .
you' re all fucking paranoid .
it was bad grass .
that' s all it was , man .
there' s no such things as fucking demons .
come on .
carol , i' m going to need you with your pad in about 15 minutes .
well , i' m sorry ,
mr. singer , but you know how many people come to me with the injustices of the world ?
it would break your heart .
mr. geary , this is very important to us .
the army did something to us , and we' ve got to find out what .
the army ?
jeez , what' s with you guys ?
this is not a walk to the library .
this is the u. s. government .
this is red tape coming out your ass .
you know what i mean ?
that' s why we' re here .
do you think you can help us ?
what am i , perry mason ?
all right .
i' il look into it .
you think we have a chance ?
i need sworn depositions from all of you and a list of platoon members or their survivors .
this is great .
i' il tell you one thing .
if we do find that the military is implicated in this , you all stand to make quite a bit of money .
not that i can predict anything , but class action suits of this kind have been awarded fairly generous judgments .
that wouldn' t be so bad , would it ?
we' re not in it for the money .
that' s right .
right .
all right , gentlemen , who wants to go first ?
i put a hungry man in the oven .
it will be ready at a quarter of .
ok .
there' s a tossed salad in the fridge .
ok .
thanks .
i got you some apple juice .
no , not red cheek .
red cheek .
ah , shit .
don' t drink it all .

oh , your lawyer called .
when ?
when you were in the shower .
you didn' t call me ?
he didn' t give me a chance .
he hung up on me .
look , jake , don' t be upset , ok ?
he' s not taking your case .
what ?
what do you mean ?
he said you didn' t have one .
what' s he talking about ?
i don' t know .
he was very rude .
he said your friends backed out .
i don' t believe this .
oh , baby , i feel terrible .
i' d stay , but i' m so late .
we' il talk when i get home , ok ?
yeah .
are you all right ?
yeah , i' m fine .

it' s hard to explain .
well , try .

i' il call the others .
they' re not interested , jake .

the army did something to me .
i got to prove it .

you' re not telling me something .
what' s wrong with you ?
i' il tell you what' s wrong .

no .
how did you get your doctorate without reading eckhart ?
relax .
ok , good .
now turn over gently right side .
the other right , ok ?
you' re a regular basket case , you know that ?
eckhart saw hell , too .
you know what he said ?
he said the only thing that burns in hell is the part of you that won' t let go of your life your memories , your attachments .
they burn them all away .
but they' re not punishing you , he said .
they' re freeing your soul .
relax .
good .
so the way he sees it ... if you' re frightened of dying and you' re holding on ... you' il see devils tearing your life away .
but if you' ve made your peace , then the devils are really angels freeing you from the earth .
it' s just a matter of how you look at it , that' s all .
so don' t worry , ok ?

i don' t know .
could you tell him something ?
tell him i was in vietnam
vietnam ?
there was a secret experiment
what experiment ?
i need to see him as soon as possible .
hello .
this is jacob singer .
i was in country in ' 68 .
i was in a chemical warfare unit in saigon .
we conducted secret government experiments .
my god .
are you there ?
yeah .
do you want to know more ?
where can i meet you ?
on 128th and westside highway in front of a coffee truck .
how will i know you ?
you already know me .
i do ?
yes .
make sure you' re not followed , ok ?
all right .
bye .
i knew it .
who was that ?
a chemist .
part of a chemical warfare unit out of saigon .
i knew something was going on .
jake ... please don' t go .
oh , i' m sorry .
jacob ?
hi .
i' m michael newman .
yeah .
i told you you' d know me .
i' ve been tracking you for a long time .
i wish i' d spoken to you before tonight .
why are you following me ?
you' re one of the survivors , jacob .
come on .
we can' t talk here .
it' s not safe .
come on .
so , first i' m arrested , right ?
best lsd i ever made right down the drain .
i figured , " this is it .
20 years in the can if i' m lucky .
that was 1968 .
long time ago .
really .
next thing i know , i' m on riker' s island .
ever been there , man ?
well , suddenly , they take me from my cell , they throw me in a waiting room with bank teller windows .
four army colonels with medals up their asses are standing on the other side .
they say to me , if i come to vietnam for two years
no action , just work in a lab they' il drop all charges and wipe the record clean .
i' d only been in jail 13 hours .
i knew ' nam couldn' t be any worse .
shows how little you knew .
yeah , really .
they had me by the balls .
next thing i know , i' m in saigon .
i' m working in a top secret lab synthesizing mind altering drugs .
not the street stuff .
they had us isolating special properties the dark side .
they wanted a drug that increased aggressive tendencies .
they were scared .
they were worried .
they figured you guys were too soft , not fighting up to your potential .
they wanted something to stir you up , make you mad , you know , tap into your anger .
and we did it .
most powerful thing i ever saw .
even a bad trip , and believe me , i' ve had my share , do not compare to the fury of the ladder .
the ladder ?
yeah .
that' s what they called it .
a fast trip straight down the ladder right to the primal fear , right to the base anger .
i' m telling you , man , it was powerful .
i don' t need to tell you .
you already know .
we did experiments on jungle monkeys .
it worked .
they bashed each other' s heads in , gouged out their eyes , chewed off their tails .
the brass loved it .
then they made us try it on charlie .
we , uh ... took these pows , you know ?
just kids , really .
and ... we put them in this courtyard ,
and we fed them huge doses of the stuff .
i mean , they were worse than the monkeys .
i didn' t know men could do those things .
anyway , there was this big offensive coming up , right ?
everyone knew it
time magazine , huntley , brinkley
and the brass were scared because they knew we couldn' t win .
morale was down , it was getting ugly in the states .
you remember .
yeah .
so , a couple days later , they decide to use the ladder ... on one test battalion ...
yours .
just an infinitesimal dose in the food supply , they said , just to prove its effectiveness in the field .
they were sure your unit would have the highest kill ratio in the whole god damn offensive , and they were right you did except not the way they thought .
no one can remember that night .
i get flashes , but they don' t make sense .
what happened ?
was there an offensive ?
yeah , a couple days later .
it was fierce , but you guys never saw it .
but there was an attack ?
it was a fight , right ?
yeah , but not with the cong .
with who ?
you killed each other .
what ?
it was brother against brother .
no discrimination .
you tore each other to pieces .
my god .
i knew it would happen .
i warned them .
i fucking warned them !
ohh , fuck .
i was just some hippie chemist , right ?
what did i know ?
fuck .
i talked to the guys who bagged the bodies .
they were in worse shape than you , believe me .
they saw what was left .
i needed to find you , you know ?
i felt responsible .
the ladder was my baby .
i' m going to brooklyn .
not with me , you' re not .
i get lost in brooklyn .
i know the way .
listen ...
this is all the money i have .
take me home , please .
where' s your home ?
dr. singer .
well ... it' s been a long time .
hello , sam .
are you all right ?
yeah , i' m ok .
do you want some help ?
i can call upstairs .
no , no .
that' s ok .
thanks , sam .
sarah ?
jed ?
eli ?
if you' re frightened of dying and you' re holding on , you' il see devils tearing your life away .
if you' ve made your peace , then the devils are really angels freeing you from the earth .
gabe ?
gabe ?
hi , dad .
it' s ok .
come on .
let' s go up .
come on .
he' s gone .
he looks kind of peaceful , the guy .
put up a hell of a fight , though .
what' s the guy' s name ?
singer .
jacob singer .
i don' t mind the gray skies
you make them blue
sonny boy
friends may forsake me
let them all forsake me
i still have you

for i love you so
sonny boy
