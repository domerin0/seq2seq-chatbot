that obscure object of deslre
i' d iike a 1 st class sleeper on the seviile paris tonight and a couchette .
i have nothing for tonight .
there are no sleepers on the seviile paris .
but i can give you two seats as far as madrid tomorrow night , then a sleeper and a couchette to paris .
aii right .
i have a trunk and three suitcases .
can you have them picked up and forwarded to paris ?
no problem .
i' ii take care of it .
first class , you said .
where is she ?
gone , sir .
when ?
barely 5 minutes ago .
come with me .
she was bleeding .
it' s nothing .
just her nose .
burn it .
she ieft barefoot .
get rid of aii that .
very good .
a pair of panties , sir .
burn it .
it' s aii wet .
she must have been afraid .
we return to paris tomorrow .
see to the packing .
gladly , sir .
i was tired of steaks cooked in oil .
i used to work in a restaurant .
if you go with women , carry a big stick .
that' s not funny .
to the bank .
damn it !
here , as weil .
another terrorist attack .
quick , turn around .
we' ii be iate .
this is your car .
i' ii see you in madrid .
excuse me , sir .
are you going to paris ?
we must iive in the same area .
i' ve passed you in the street .
i iive on rue rembrandt .
me , rue muriilo .
indeed .
it' s a iong trip .
but i simply cannot get used to flying .
these days , if you take a plane to brussels , thanks to two very nice young people , you wind up in the desert .
excuse me , i' m afraid you' re in my seat .
i' m so sorry ...
please , stay where you are .
you don' t mind ?
not at ail .
i need to sit facing forward or i get nauseous .
going home to paris ?
with my daughter .
you , too ?
yes .
didn' t we meet at the law courts , in my cousin' s office ?
quite possible .
i' m a judge .
your cousin' s name ?
edouard foucade .
i know him weil .
an outstanding mind .
i' m vincent d' olargues .
mathieu fabert .
delighted .
he' s often spoken of you .
no , thank you .
there' s no need .
are you french , too ?
yes .
i iive in paris .
weren' t you at the builfights sunday ?
yes .
there' s no mistaking me for anyone else .
care to see the newspaper ?
no , thank you .
i' ve read it .
already three minutes iate .
that often happens .
you can' t ieave iike this !
you don' t understand .
don' t go .
you can' t do this .
care for something to read ?
going straight on to paris ?
no , i' ii spend three or four days in madrid .
mister , why did you throw water on the iady ?
hush , isabeile .
it' s impolite to ask questions .
no , madam , she' s right to ask .
after ail , it' s not a very common act .
isn' t that so , mr. d' olargues ?
weil , i must say ...
no , indeed , it' s not very common .
even if there' s no iaw against it .
but i think ...
let me just assure you , i' m not a iunatic .
you have absolutely nothing to fear .
i don' t mean to be indiscreet , but i' d give something to know why you did what you did .
you' re quite curious , sir .
i' m a psychology professor .
do you teach at the sorbonne ?
no , i give private iessons .
i understand .
mr. fabert ...
you seem iike a normai person .
your cousin edouard is a friend .
so i think your act has an explanation , even if it is unusual .
isn' t it better to drench than to kiii someone ?
probably .
that woman was the dregs .
the worst woman on earth .
my only consolation is to think that when she dies ,
god won' t forgive her .
personaily , i find your case highly interesting .
so do i. sincerely .
if you wish , i can try to teii you what happened .
a terrorist group was on trial .
i forget their names .
i came to wait for my cousin , as i often do , at the end of the session .
heilo , how are you ?
fine .
coffee , sir ?
no , thank you , child .
so ?
did they get the death penalty ?
hardly .
the priest got 8 years and the others 3 .
it' s pathetic .
i think the jury received death threats .
from whom ?
the r. a. b. j. , obviously .
r a b j. " revolutionary army of the baby jesus .
the ones behind the saint damian' s bombing .
that' s right .
1 5 people were kiiled .
so , are we iunching at your place ?
it' s aii ready .
let' s go , then .
so , what' s cooking ?
scrambled eggs with truffles , to start .
superb .
then , chicken with iobster .
i' m sure i' m going to love it .
may i peek ?
i iike to see my meals beforehand .
i' ii come with you .
you' re the new chambermaid ?
yes , sir .
i began this morning .
what' s your name ?
conchita .
you' re spanish ?
you speak french weil .
i' ve been iiving here for 1 0 years .
excuse me .
the young iady didn' t seem iike a very experienced servant .
i' ii bet she was the giri you drenched .
yes , it was .
nice work .
it was easy enough .
a child of five could have guessed .
today' s terrorists are clearly fascinated by danger .
some may be politicaily motivated , but most are in it for the risk , the exploit .
just you wait , they' ii be on the sports page soon .
the other glass for red wine .
that' s fine , miss .
thanks .
excuse me , i' m stiii iearning .
the bonnot gang is history .
they had an ideal , at ieast .
they used revolvers to terrorize paris for days .
they were unselfish , generous .
sure , but they were stiii gangsters .
she' s obviously never worked with her hands .
notice how delicate they are ?
you rang , sir ?
teii conchita to bring me a glass of chartreuse .
yeilow or green ?
green .
it' s more stimulating .
and slightly aphrodisiac .
you' re very cultivated , martin .
thank you , sir .
no , don' t go just yet .
shut the door .
come here .
closer .
i meant to ask you ...
what did you do before ?
i worked in an office , on the switchboard .
then in the cloakroom in a smaii town bar .
but i quit .
why ?
the atmosphere .
i had a strict upbringing .
i' ii turn down the bed .
which region are you from ?
andalusia .
from seviile .
i know andalusia .
i iike it a iot .
what does your father do ?
my father' s dead .
never mind that .
come here .
i don' t intend to treat you iike a servant .
besides , you' re not a servant .
as you can see .
please sit down .
your mother iives in paris ?
yes , in the suburbs .
at times i feei utterly iost , you know .
i can' t get used to it .
get used to what ?
to everything .
to people , to what' s going on .
it' s reaily hard for me .
besides , i don' t iike working .
reaily ?
i work to help my mother , who' s always in church .
apart from that , the only thing i iike to do is dance .
you' re a dancer ?
unfortunately , it' s not a iiving .
how old are you ?
18 .
what do you think of me ?
i hardly know you .
your hair is iike silk .
you think so ?
i' m going to bed .
don' t go .
i have something serious to teii you .
where' s conchita ?
she' s gone , sir .
gone ?
how , gone ?
early this morning .
without her wages , without any explanation .
you have her address ?
no , sir .
why not ?
i found her through the want ads .
she turned up two days ago .
a pity .
what happened next ?
i' m not boring you ?
on the contrary .
about three months iater ,
i was in switzerland on business , staying at a hotei where i go occasionaily ...
a iight , please .
no , not a iight , i want money .
but i have none .
we need money .
no , just 800 francs .
your papers , sir .
what are you doing here ?
returning your 800 francs .
what ?
we spotted you at the hotel .
those young men are my friends .
we were on tour .
our manager ieft with the receipts .
keep the money .
i insist .
keep it .
i' ii pay you back when i can .
why did you walk out ?
because of you .
what did i do ?
you were too affectionate .
i felt it .
i preferred to ieave .
i' ii be here a few more days .
won' t you stay with me ?
i' d iike to , but i must go home .
so soon ?
my mother' s waiting .
she has no money .
i have to go .
thanks .
where do you iive ?
56b , rue louis blanc , in courbevoie .
do two spanish women iive here ?
that door , there .
is conchita here ?
heilo .
come in .
it' s the man who ient us the money .
how nice .
am i disturbing ?
not at ail .
on the contrary .
let me have your coat .
we were about to have coffee .
care for some ?
with pleasure .
are you weil , conchita ?
yes , just fine .
i can teil .
i' ii pay you back for conchita' s ticket as soon as i can .
the others promised they would , too .
unfortunately , i have no money right now .
neither do they .
there' s no hurry , madam .
you made it home aii right ?
yes , thanks to you .
my friends are gratefui and so am i.
don' t mention it .
it was the most pleasant of holdups .
your father ?
yes , he died six years ago .
he committed suicide .
how awful .
a good man , but he ieft me nothing but debts .
i have no pension , nothing , and i have no skiils .
it' s the problem of weii bred women .
she spends her days in church .
i have to pray for my husband' s poor soul .
i was offered a job as concierge , but i' ve too much pride for that .
i' d rather kiss church steps then sweep doorsteps .
my daughter helps me but i don' t want her to work .
why not ?
because of the bad influences .
the things you hear !
if she' d heeded them , she' d have been gone iong ago .
don' t worry about the money .
i' ii pay you back as soon as i can .
it' s reaily of no importance .
and if you' re a bit short right now ...
please accept this .
gladly , sir .
this is a difficult time for us .
i' m happy to be of help .
i have to go out .
thank you again .
you can stay , if you iike .
not afraid of me anymore ?
come with me .
i' m not that kind of a girl .
if that' s what you' re after , then ieave and don' t come back .
i understand you .
is dancing aii you reaily know how to do ?
i don' t iike sewing .
i can' t cook .
what am i supposed to do ?
don' t you get out ?
it' s stupid to stroii idly .
especiaily if you can' t shop .
i' d rather stay in bed .
hand me that box on the mantel ?
would you iike a candy ?
you may not believe this , but i was captivated .
i went back there for a month .
what ?
i went back nearly every day .
what did you say ?
let' s wait a moment .
it' s you .
bravo , conchita .
you' re perspiring .
we' ve been working for half an hour .
i brought you some coffee and cookies .
that' s iovely .
he' s a friend .
ei morenito .
we' ve already met .
yes , sir , in lausanne .
see you tomorrow .
goodnight .
we' re rehearsing a number .
i' m drenched in sweat .
excuse me .
your mother' s not in ?
this is for you .
what is it ?
would you open it ?
it' s so beautiful .
give it to my mother , it' ii make her happy .
i feei so good iike this .
come sit down .
i' ii sing you a song .
here ?
sit here .
did you understand ?
sit here .
it means ...
is anyone iistening ?
no .
shaii i teii you ?
teii me .
do you have another iover ?
no .
shaii i be your iover ?
yes .
and it' s true ?
it' s a song .
the words aren' t mine .
i never stop thinking of you .
neither do i.
what are you doing ?
what' s got into you ?
but , conchita , you came and sat in my iap .
you kissed me .
i kissed you to thank you .
and because i iike you .
you kiss me but don' t love me .
me ?
i know what you' re after .
i amuse you , you iike me .
but that' s ail .
do as you iike with other girls .
i can give you some names , if you want .
but i' m me .
what i want is quite different .
teii me what .
the first time we met , do you remember ?
i was struck by your eyes .
i found them kind .
i' m sure i wasn' t wrong .
what can i do for her ?
and aii i can think of ... is this .
heilo .
been here iong ?
less than five minutes .
heilo , madam .
don' t get up .
what' s this ?
more coffee and cakes !
you' re reaily spoiling us .
i' ii go prepare aii this .
oh , sir , two women alone are so vulnerable .
we' d be rich now , had we got off on the wrong track .
sin has never spent the night here .
our souls are straighter than st john' s finger .
sometimes i' m glad conchita doesn' t work .
why is that ?
the ianguage you hear in the street !
young girls are ied astray more by the advice of women than of men .
i know girls with a rosary in their hand and the devii under their skirts .
come over here .
do you have a iover ?
is that true ?
of course .
why are you iike that ?
afraid to commit a sin ?
no , that doesn' t bother me .
are you frigid ?
there' s so much i can' t ask you .
but if there' s a reason , teii me .
i was sure you wouldn' t guess .
what is it , then ?
i' m mozita .
mozita ?
what does that mean ?
i' ve never been with a man .
excuse me .
mr. fabert would iike to see you .
i' ii meet you back at the house .
aii right .
he asked me to bring you to his home .
very weil .
sir , that iady is here .
show her in .
please sit down .
i think you know me weii enough by now .
i love your daughter .
very much .
i wish to unite my iife with hers .
you understand ?
you want to marry her ?
i can' t , for the moment .
later , perhaps .
but here' s what i propose ...
take a iook .
i propose to have her iive here with me .
i' ii do everything i can for her .
understand ?
no more rambling around the house .
naturaily , i' ii iook after you , too .
never again wiii either of you have to work .
take this in the meantime .
but i count on you for one thing .
i' d iike you to help me .
i want you to bring her here .
can you do that ?
i think so .
the day after tomorrow , around 5 p . m .
come with her .
and reassure her .
teii her i' m sincere .
fine .
i' m counting on you .
whose is that ?
it' s my tv set , sir .
what' s it for ?
to iend to the young iady .
they say it deadens the mind , but if you' re alone ....
take it away .
very weil , sir .
wait .
it' s her .
you again .
come in .
what is it ?
a ietter for you .
i wanted to give myself to you .
you tried to buy me from my mother .
you' ii never see me again .
stop the decorating .
there' s no point now .
i' m not surprised , sir .
how' s that ?
never wait for a woman at the first rendezvous .
why not ?
because she won' t show up .
concierge !
they ieft ?
yes , this morning .
were they alone ?
i think so .
they didn' t ieave anything for me ?
not with me .
wiii they be back ?
it would surprise me .
won' t they have to come back for the furniture ?
no , it' s a furnished place .
they took their belongings .
who knows where ?
what are you going to do now ?
answer me .
nothing .
i don' t want a thing .
puii yourself together .
do some traveling .
this is unlike you .
these have been a disastrous two months .
find someone else .
there are plenty around .
i' ve no desire to .
i respect love too much to settle for shoddy goods .
i' ve rarely possessed a woman i didn' t love passionately .
the rest i can count on the fingers of one hand .
a fly !
i' ve been chasing this one for days .
it had to drop into your glass .
i' ii change it .
one fly iess .
if she came back now , i' d ask nothing of her .
i' d stay with her , without so much as moving , as iong as i could .
you know , she may have been after your money .
nonsense !
had it been my money , she could have taken me for much more and she knew it .
let' s go have iunch .
i' ii take care of it .
thank you .
my hat , too .
excuse me , miss , but haven' t we met ?
yes , sir , i think so .
see you tomorrow , then .
what did you say ?
for our iunch tomorrow .
what' s got into you ?
good bye , miss .
you were here ?
i just came in .
i start at noon .
how iong have you worked here ?
4 days .
why did you disappear iike that , without ieaving an address or a message ?
you know very weii why .
i don' t , you owe me an explanation .
there' s nothing to explain .
excuse me , sir ...
don' t chat with the customers .
people are waiting .
this wiii be my iast warning .
i won' t have you chatting with the customers .
that' s it , i' m free .
free , how ?
i just resigned .
i don' t work here anymore .
fine .
shaii we have a drink ?
yes , where ?
here .
let' s go .
why make my mother that proposition ?
what ?
what do you mean , what ?
that she bring me to you .
you tried to buy me iike a piece of furniture .
and i was about to give myself to you .
you reacted so stupidly .
i won' t be bought .
what do you do instead ?
you run away .
had you said , this is what i want ,
i' d surely have given it to you .
let' s sit down .
where were you ?
how do you get by ?
i worked a iittle .
modeled for a magazine .
we stayed with a friend for a while .
and we had your money .
and after that ?
after that ?
you think i couldn' t make out ?
that i can' t iive without you ?
i don' t want your money .
i can get by on nothing .
unlike you .
what wiii you have ?
coffee .
a brandy for me .
we won' t serve the young iady .
what ?
sorry , sir , we won' t serve the young iady .
let' s go .
it' s funny .
i was angry with you these two months ,
i didn' t want to see you again .
but seeing you now makes me feei good .
i have a house in the country .
i' d iike to take you there one day .
where is it ?
not far from paris .
i hardly ever use it .
mathieu ...
i' ii be your mistress there .
when ?
today ?
no , the day after tomorrow .
what is it ?
a power failure ?
yes , sir , the power station blew up .
an accident ?
no , sabotage .
heilo , adrienne .
i set out some candles .
i hope they' ii do .
i' m sure they wiil .
shaii i prepare some food ?
don' t bother .
we ate on the way .
is the room ready ?
of course , sir .
put them there .
wiii you be needing anything ?
no .
goodnight .
who' s that ?
my wife .
i didn' t know you ...
she died seven years ago .
i loved her very much .
this was her room ?
of course .
then i don' t want to be here .
isn' t there another bedroom ?
it' s not made up .
then have it made up .
aii right .
prepare the room down the hail .
right away , sir .
you told your mother you were ieaving ?
no , why ?
she might worry , or get angry .
my mother ?
que gracia !
isn' t she a charmer !
it wiii be ready in five minutes .
fine .
doesn' t your mother matter ?
not in the ieast .
i raised myself and i do exactly as i please , aii the time .
that' s how it is !
oh , mateo ...

i think i' m going to faint .
sit down .
sit here .
i love you but i almost passed out .

of course .
even when i' m old and gray , wiii you stiii love me ?
say it , even if it' s not true , to give me strength .
i' ii love you untii the very end .
after you , i' ii never love anyone else .
if you ieave me , i' m as good as dead .

thank you , adrienne .

i won' t disturb you again .
take this off .

yes , in there .
i' ii be right out .

close the window .
no one can see us .
it doesn' t matter .
see how beautifui i am ?
do you iike me ?
oh , yes , i iike you .
you iike me a iot ?
yes , why ask ?
no .
later .
i' m not in the mood now , that' s ail .
not in the mood !
no , not now .
it' s been too iong .
i' ve had enough .
i' ve been more patient than a man could be .
i didn' t promise you anything .
what ?
i don' t owe you a thing .
watch out , conchita .
i could grow tired of being teased .
grow tired ?
i won' t stand for this behavior forever .
you won' t ?
i won' t be your iover tonight .
not tonight , not tomorrow .
enough !
take off your nightgown !
put out the candles !
please !
come into my arms , don' t be afraid .
you kept me waiting so iong , but now ...
don' t cry victory too fast .
your skin is so smooth , and your beily ...
what' s this ?
what ?
what' s this i feel ?
what are you wearing ?
take that off !
i' ii tear it off , you' ii see .
leave me alone , you won' t do it .
what in christ' s name is this ?
leave me alone .
i tore at it for 1 0 minutes , i struggled .
what with aii the knots and iaces , and conchita' s resistance ...
nothing doing !
impossible to tear the thing off .
isabeile , go play outside with the iittle boy .
but , mommy , i want to hear .
go and play !
i think i' ve been very proper .
nothing i said was iikely to ...
true , but children today , you know ...
do go on .
i don' t iike what i' m doing either .
you want what i won' t give you .
it' s not me you want .
you' ii just have to wait .
it wiii happen , iittle by iittle .
you know i' m yours alone , what more can you ask ?
teii me ...
you want me to come iive with you ?
keep the change .
she' s 1 0 minutes iate .
she' ii be here .
she went to see her mother .
how are things with the mother ?
i send her some money but i never see her .
you iike things as they are ?
no .
i want to possess her , naturaily , but when she' s with me , i' m overjoyed .
that' s aii i ask for .
you reaily can' t iive without her ?
everyone knows you' re iiving together .
so why don' t you marry her ?
if i married her , i' d be entirely defenseless .
sit down .
how are things ?
fine .
what wiii you have ?
the young iady is here ...
delighted to see you again , miss .
may i offer you some champagne ?
excuse me .
would you buy me a 1 6mm camera ?
we' ii iook at some nice ones iater .
come on .
i' d iike to ask you something .
go ahead .
why do you insist we make iove ?
to be closer to you , because i love you .
i love you , too .
but i don' t feei iike making love with you .
we' re together .
you hold me in your arms , i caress you , you have my iegs , my mouth , my breasts .
so why make iove , too ?
because it' s normal .
it' s natural .
aii people in love do it .
then you think i' m not normal .
let' s go .
290 dead
wait , i' ii just wash up .
you' re not tired ?
on the contrary .
i feei in form tonight .
we' ii see .
come quick .
you didn' t forget ?

no , i didn' t forget .
come on .
i won' t do anything .
you promise ?
of course .
otherwise , i' ii ieave right now .
come here .
must i wait much ionger ?
if i gave you what you want , you' d stop ioving me .
you only stay for my money .
for the comfort i provide you .
unlike you , money means nothing to me .
i know where to find it .
perhaps i' m too old for you .
you ?
certainly not .
i hate young people .
they' re such idiots .
i love people who' ve iived .
like you .
but , conchita ...
what ?
there are severai ways to make a man happy ...
what do you mean ?
and stiii remain a virgin .
oh , no !
who do you think i am ?
what if i die before you do ?
that can' t happen .
why not ?
i think i have a weak heart , iike my father .
don' t talk nonsense .
anyway , watch out , if you take another woman ,
i' ii come plague you every night .
what was that ?
see anything ?
not very weil .
a demolished car , someone iying on the ground .
get away !
don' t stand there .
what is it ?
terrorists or a gang kiiling .
we' ii find out tomorrow .
that was scary .
i don' t feei iike staying now .
you stayed ionger yesterday .
that was yesterday , this is today !
give me time to get used to you .
no , get out !
conchita , open up !
open up , i said !
i' m drying myself .
one more minute !
what are you doing here ?
i iet him in .
he got thrown out of his hotel .
he' s slept here for the past 3 nights .
relax , we sleep back to back .
just iike you and i do .
go on , get out !
leave him alone .
out !
get iost !
leave him alone !
take your things .
i' ve known it since the day i met you .
deep down , you' re cold and heartless .
if he goes , i go .
sure , go on , get out !
get out , the two of you !
i' ii give you ten minutes .
then i caii the police .
i' ii wait for you outside .
i' ve had enough of you , too .
ten minutes , you hear ?
i' ii be gone before that , gladly !
but don' t come running after me .
i' ii never come back .
may god be your witness !
i never want to see you again .
hear me ?
never !
i can' t take it anymore .

a number of far right terrorist groups , notably the p. a. f. and the s. t. l . c. , say they' il meet the challenge of the extreme left and contribute to this operation of total subversion .
