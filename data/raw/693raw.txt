hey .
what' s up , everybody ?
i' m thurgood jenkins .
you know , it' s funny , but i can trace the entire path of my life to one childhood memory .
my last clear memory , really .
you see , it was the summer before ninth grade .
it was me , brian , kenny , scarface ... and of course the loveable old james .
oh , hold on .
wait a minute .
old james old james wasn' t there .
i don' t even know nobody named old james .
shoot .
go on !
why don' t you light it up there , brother ?
all right .
here goes nothin ' .
i don' t remember graduatin ' .
and my first sexual experience i don' t remember that either .
but , man , i will never forget the first time i smoked ... that sweet , sweet chiva .
feel anything ?
yeah , i feel my chest cavin ' in .
this stuff didn' t even work .
man !
come on .
let' s get some candy and get out of here , b.
i' ve heard people say they don' t get high the first time they smoke .
not me .
oh , not us .
we were really , really high .
we was toe up !
do you guys feel different ?
a little .
how ' bout you , scarface ?
how you doin ' , kenny ?
kenny ?
i haven' t been so thirsty in my entire life .
do you guys hear that ?
feels like jerry garcia' s in my head .
am i goin ' crazy ?
we look at that day as the day we met the fifth member of our crew marijuana !
oh , lord , we was hooked !
so , now we all live together in new york .
i myself am a master of the custodial arts , or a janitor if you want to be a dick about it .
anyway , i work at this lab , frankensense and burr pharmaceutical .
they do pharmaceutical testing for the government ... and big corporations and
and i am the happiest custodian alive .
this job ... sucks .
abba zabba , you my only friend .
ah , it could be worse .
i could have scarface' s job .
heifer with cheese .
you son of a bitch , i' m right behind you !
turn around and ask me for heifer with cheese , yo !
why you gotta make me feel inferior ' cause i' m on the grill , b ?
damn !
scarface is kind of a hyper guy for a pothead .
sorry .
kenny is probably doin ' the best out of all of us .
he' s a kindergarten teacher at some school downtown , which i know might scare a lot of parents , seeing as how he' s a weedhead and all .
but let me tell you , man , that guy does wonders for those children' s self esteem .
thank you .
oh , i love you so much , little one .  all of you .

thank you .
then we scraped together what little money we had ... and bought bikes to help us move the product , then stapled samples of our weed on the back of our business cards .
then we called the company mr. nice guy in honor of our friend kenny .
hey , uh , you guys believe in angels or
man , give me your fruit cocktail .

take it .
i' m somebody' s bitch .
you guys gotta do something .
there' s this guy nasty nate who' s after my cocktail fruit , and everyone here likes fresh fish .
and then the squirrel master came out of left field and told me i' m his bitch .
help !

you might not like it .
we gonna sell weed , yo .

this weed is fantastic !
we kept pluggin ' away with the weed deliveries , and we kept meetin ' different kinds of smokers , like this lady .
she' s an " i' m only creative lf i smoke " smoker .
hi .
she believes weed , and only weed , brings out the artist in her .
would you like to hear some of my poetry ?
not really .
you really should .
i have killed .
i have helped kill .
i have killed part of myself .
i cannot change this , l .
i must seek buddha .
i must seek christ .
you must seek therapy .
that' s what i would go with , but that' s my own
the macgyver smoker is a very handy guy to have around , especially when it comes to reefer .
hey , man , we' re out of papers .
all right .
then get me a toilet paper roll , a corkscrew and some tin foil .
we don' t have a corkscrew .
all right .
then get me an avocado , an ice pick and my snorkel .
trust me , bro .
i' ve made bongs with less .
hurry up !
and then you got your straight up potheads .
ooh !
you can spot these people by their lack of motivation , mood swings , forgetfulness and , of course , the dreaded low sperm count .
we ain' t no goddamn potheads .
hmm .
shit .
then you have the avid nonsmoker .
a lot of times they' il get your number accidentally from one of their girlfriends , call up and place an order knowing they don' t smoke weed ... and request that you personally deliver it .
then when you get there , they' re all mad that it' s you sellin ' weed .
you smoke weed ?
at last we can share everything .
get off me , you lying son of a bitch !
what is this ?
looks like some sort of a business card .
yeah , with your number on it .
you know , i can' t believe this !
i can' t believe that i fell for another one of you lowlife assholes again .
god , what is wrong with me ?
hey
hey , mary jane , i can explain everything , all right ?
good bye , thurgood .
wait !
hold up !
hey , mary jane !
mary jane , look , the only reason i lied to you was because i like you ... and i wanted to be with you .
mary jane .
knight rider .
a shadowy flight into the dangerous world ... of a man who does not exist .
thurgood , why the long face , man ?
mary jane dumped me .

i would imagine he' s some sort of drug dealer .

ooh .

eleven days wasn' t gonna give us much time .
we really had to hustle , and that meant takin ' on new customers .
damn , b !
i been set up .
we' il get back to that in a second .
but meanwhile i hadn' t seen mary jane in , like , a week .
i couldn' t stop thinkin ' about her , man .
i missed her .
then i started thinkin ' about the fact that she was the only girl i slept with in five years .
then i started thinkin ' about the girl i slept with before mary jane .
i had to get mary jane back .  what do you want ?
i want you back , mary jane .
i miss you .
i' il do whatever it takes to get you back .
i can' t quit sellin ' it yet , but i' il quit smokin ' it .
lf that' s what you want , then then i' il change for you .
heard that before .
said that before .
but this time i mean it .
i' m gonna come back here .
i' m gonna be clean .
i' m gonna be sober .
there' s no more weed , no more nothin ' .
mary jane , you' il see .
i' il be back .
i' il be a changed man .
there' s a new thurgood jenkins today .
i love you .
man , that first day of sobriety sucked .
i was a real irritable guy when i wasn' t smokin ' marijuana .
i couldn' t stop thinkin ' about gettin ' high .
it was time to get help .

my name is thurgood .
hi , thurgood .
hi .
i' m here today because i' m addicted ... to marijuana .  you in here because of marijuana ?

you wanna know what happened ?
i' il tell you what happened .
samson and his girls came rollin ' up in here lookin ' for me .
they was gonna mess me up if i didn' t bring them mr. nice guy .
so they probably roughed the guy up , then they started goin ' to war with the apartment .
they had num chuks , bolos .
they be doin ' lndian burns .
killer paid the price , yo .
he got the wrath .
he got the wrath of the num chuks , yo .
i think it' s more complex than that .
more complex than that ?
you know what i think happened ?
you want to hear what i think , man ?
first of all , to understand what happened to killer , you gotta understand who killer the dog was .
now , killer was born to a three legged bitch mother .
he was always ashamed of this , man .
and right after that , he' s adopted by this man , tito liebowitz .
he' s a small time gunrunner ... and , uh , rottweiler fight promoter .
so he puts killer into training .
they see killer' s good .
he is damn good .
but then he had the fight of his life .
they pit him against his brother nibbles .
and killer said , " no , man , that' s my brother .
i can' t fight nibbles !
and he made ' em fight anyway .
and then killer , he killed nibbles .
and killer said , " that' s it .
he called off all his fights , and he started doing crack , and he freaked out .
and then in a rage , he collapsed , and his heart ... no longer beat .
wow .
you know , uh ,
i never thought i' d say this to anybody , but you two smoke entirely too much reefer .
what if the guy did it ?
no way .
you think ?
yo ?
yo , the guy , did you kill my dog ?
i believe him , yo .
i don' t know why , but i do .
