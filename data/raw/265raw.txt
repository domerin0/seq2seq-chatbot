hiya , bruce .
how ya feelin ' ?
grub okay in here for ya ?
what do you want ?
that' s a qood question .
see , i need your cells to triqqer some chemical distress siqnals .
you know , so you can turn a little qreen for me aqain ... and i can carve off a piece of the real you , analyze it , patent it , make a fortune .
do you mind ?
i' il never let you .
i' m not sure you' ve qot much of a choice .
come on , bruce .
aren' t you feeling a little angry ?
after all , you' ve only qot me to play with now that betty' s dumped you and qone back to berkeley .
you' re lyinq .
you know , for me this is a win win situation .
you turn green , and all these guys come in and kill you ... and i perform the autopsy .
you don' t ...
bad science , maybe ... but personally qratifyinq .
come on , bruce !
let' s see what you qot .
never .
you know , consciously you may control it , but subconsciously , i bet that' s another story .
all riqht , let' s jump start those brain waves .
bruce .
my dear miss ross .
welcome back .
there are two quards riqht outside .
you don' t have to worry .
i' m not anqry with you .
not anymore .
what do you want ?
it' s over for me now .
i know that .
and soon it' il be over for bruce .
that' s why i' ve come to you to ask you if you could persuade your father , as a man , as a father himself , that if i turn myself in now , peacefully ... and before he puts me away forever , that he would let me see my son ... for one last time .
could you do that for me ?
it' s out of my father' s hands now .
i understand .
he' s a puppet now .
i don' t blame him .
you shouldn' t .
you should blame yourself for what you' ve done to your son .
and what have i done to my son , miss ross ?
nothinq .
i tried to improve on the limits in myself .
myself ! .
not him !
can you understand ?
to improve on nature .
my nature !
knowledqe of oneself ! .
it' s the only path to the truth ... that qive men the power to qo beyond god' s boundaries !
you know what' s beyond your boundaries ?
other people .
all you' ve given bruce is fear .
fear of life .
fear ?
perhaps , miss ross .
and loneliness too .
yes ...
i feel them both .
but i have lived ... completely once .
i was so much in love , and she so much wanted a baby .
my baby .
i could tell from the moment she conceived ... that it wasn' t a son i had given her ... but something else .
a monster , maybe .
i should have put a stop to it right then , but i was curious and that was my downfall .
and as i watched this tiny life unfold ,
i began to imagine the horror of it , and my curiosity was replaced ... with compassion .
but they took away my chance to cure him .
your father threw me out .
what are you doinq ?
i remember that day so well every moment , every sensation walking into the house , the feeling of the handle of the knife in my hand .
i knew i was doing a father' s work , fulfilling a father' s mercy .
david , please stop it . !
no . !
david , no . !
talk to me . !
listen . !
but then she surprised me .
no . !
no . !
david , no !
it was as if ... she and the knife ... merqed .
no !
you cannot imagine ... the unbearable fiinality of it .
and in that one moment ...
i took everything that was dear to me ... and transformed it into nothing more ... than a memory .
