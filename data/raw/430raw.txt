man , give me $50 !
it' s all i got .
this is part of a $50 bill like billy' s with the hidden barcode .
the corner tore .
happens all the time .
no , the barcode' s going up , so it comes off this corner .
lf it comes off this corner it should have ink on it .
it' s too big to be blank .
look !
it' s oki doki !
don' t let your brother get away .
i got to load my camera .
oki doki !
nice little kid .

louis ?

i wouldn' t mind giving her a massage .
when dewald took over he stuck me down here on what he calls park safety watch .
he thinks he took me out of the loop , but as long as i have a computer
i can still access most of what' s in the mainframe .
ls this the tunnel system ?
yes .
do any of these tunnels lead to somewhere only dewald' s boys can go ?
no .
all park accesses are unrestricted to park personnel .
except for the happy forest .
that' s being redone .
show me the happy forest .
that would be right here at the end of corridor b.
it' s right after ...
it' s right after ...
how long' s it been closed ?
too long .
i' m talking about the happy forest ride ?
the forest .
yes , about a couple of weeks .
it wasn' t very popular so they' re trying some new ideas .
i think they found one .
can i have this ?
sure .
thanks .
there you go .
you know ... when this thing is over ...
would you like to get together and have some dinner or something ?
that would be nice .
can you put that in here ?
sure .
there you go .
we have a date .
a date .
all right .
can you help me with this ?
there you go .
remember , an elephant never forgets .
all right .
louis , how goes it ?
fine .
nice to see you .
say hello to lrene .
you bet .

everything on schedule ?
i had to tweak the image a little bit , but it' s under control now .
foley' s up there .
get him !
will the dewald family please come to tiny town ?
the dewald family to tiny town .
but , honey , the happy forest is closed .
ok , i' il meet you at the main gate at 5 : 00 .
i' m sorry .
you' re sorry ?
this is detective axel foley .
i' d like to speak with agent fulbright .
could you patch me into his radio ?
it' s an emergency .
fulbright , foley .
i found what you' re looking for .
i' m at wonder world .
fuck !
get out here now !
get me 91 1 .
all cars in the vicinity of wonder world .
proceed there immediately .
10 19 , 10 45 , and 12 22 in progress .
why am i not surprised ?
all right , don' t shoot !
i' il put my gun down .
i put my gun on the ground , and i' m unarmed .
don' t shoot .
this is great .
you caught him .
good .
he broke into a security area .
relax .
save that shit for new talent night at san quentin .
i' m on to your operation .
my operation ?
god damn it , axel , what have you done now ?
he went berserk .
he was firing a weapon in the park .
there are hundreds of children around .
they don' t give oscars in prison .
fuck you !
there' s someone here from ...
fulbright , secret service .
i put you on a plane to detroit .
you' re gonna be glad i stayed .
i know what you' re investigating .
it' s right here .
yeah ?
and what am i investigating ?
paper , us mint quality .
that' s what was in that truck .
you wanted to follow the truck back to la to find his print shop .
it' s right here in wonder world .
what is he raving on about ?
he' s insane !
he' s proved that .
ln wonder world ?
this place is as high tech as nasa and nintendo combined .
they got a hidden room under this closed ride .
i was in there .
that' s why they were chasing me .
my men were pursuing mr foley because he' s delusionary and potentially dangerous .
this room , delusionary also ?
no .
there is a closed ride , which we use to ...
i' d better take a look at it .
maybe we' d better look at it .
right here .
counterfeit bills , out of this machine .
ls this true ?
' fraid so , officer .
' fraid we' ve been caught red handed , right , ellis ?
' fraid so .
would you like to see them ?
first quality .
make a run , donald .
we call them wonder world dollars .
redeemable for admission , rides , souvenirs .
it' s our big christmas promotion .
we' re giving it away to elementary schools across the country .
you must be in on this .
you supply equipment , he supplies paper , right ?
they changed it to this shit after i left .
after we leave they' il put it back .
what' s this paper ?
ordinary rag .
they switched it .
i am tired of these accusations , officers .
i want this man arrested for public endangerment .
could i speak with you a moment ?
god damn it , we spent a fucking year with our noses up dewald' s ass !
we' re this close to locking this up , and you piss all over us !
our case is blown .
you' re going back to detroit , and if you weren' t a cop ,
i' d have you doing dead time in leavenworth for life .
detective flint , he' s yours .
let' s go , axel .
make sure he doesn' t get on the plane .
i got a wife , three kids , a mortgage and a pension that won' t cut it .
that job at wonder world is my retirement plan .
we' re being followed .
it' s the security guards at wonder world .
they probably want to make sure you get on that plane .
because of you , my future is in real fucking jeopardy .
dewald is pissed .
sanderson won' t think too highly of me .
hold up !
stop the car !
that liquor store .
stop !
what ?
oh , shit !
wait !
it' s all right .
don' t worry .
i' il get him .
when i do , i' il kill him !
axel , i left as soon as i got your call .
are you ok ?
i' m fine , but i want you to think back to the night fry disappeared .
maybe you forgot something .
no .
why would you think that ?
because this note by itself ... it just don' t make no sense .
this is important .
life and death .
why would he even send that ?
not " help , i need to talk to you , " nothing .
just this .
oh , shit .
fry must have found some sample paper .
he knew they' d kill him so he sent it to you .
there' s a barcode .
what does that mean ?
it used to belong to uncle sam .
now we got evidence .
we can put sanderson and dewald' s ass in jail .
i don' t think so .
i figured you' d call uncle dave here , so we followed him .
i actually was a real cop once so i know how you assholes think , which is to say , slowly .
very slowly .
so you were carrying the evidence the whole time , sherlock ?
here' s the real ending of the story .
let' s see if you like it .
we heard you were loose .
you had a grudge against the park .
i feared you might try to harm our beloved uncle dave , so i raced over here as fast as i could to try and stop you , but alas , it was too late .
get him all the way in the car .
take it .
take it .
you worried about fingerprints ?
forget it .
look at the gun .
it' s yours .
give me your weapon .
throw that gun in the street !
close the door and get over there !
hold on , uncle dave .
damn it !
don' t you die on me , man .
i got an emergency out here .
it' s a gut shot .
come on !
that was uncle dave .
pressure ?
90 over 40 and dropping .
i got to get his pressure up .
let' s go , guys .
i need oxygen .
let' s go .
on three .
one , two , three .
get an arterial line in him .
any medical history ?
i' ve been shot before , but it' s no big deal .
where' s the coffee machine ?
down the hall .
this is an all city alert for a suspect in the thornton shooting .
suspect is an african american male ...
you hear some black guy shot uncle dave ?
no ?
come on , let' s get out of here .
did you hear ?
somebody shot dave thornton .
somebody shot uncle dave ?
ls there a tv here ?
yes , of course .
authorities believe that foley attacked uncle dave in retaliation for some personal rejection .
the much loved uncle dave is undergoing surgery at this moment .
according to hospital sources , the prognosis is bleak .
how does a psycho like that live with himself ?
janice , axel .
get out of the park .
they' re going to kill whoever knows about roger fry' s note .
janice can' t come to the phone right now .
can i take a message ?
lf you do anything ...
it' il be your fault .
i want you at wonder world within the hour .
come to the main gate alone and unarmed .
and bring the mint paper .
then you let us go ?
lf you don' t show up here in a half hour , alone , unarmed and with no cops , i kill your friend .
and it wouldn' t be the first time , would it ?
we have an amateur video of the incident this afternoon involving uncle dave' s assassin , axel foley .
all right , don' t shoot .
i' m putting my gun down .
i' m putting it on the ground .
i' m not armed .
don' t shoot .
that was an amateur video shot earlier today by a tourist .
would you please take special care of my car ?
yes , sir .
thank you .
shit !
ackwell ...
serge , i need a weapon .
i don' t have any weapon .
i take all back .

serge , i need a weapon now .
donny .
donny , ackwell in some kind of rush , ok ?
so take the annihilator and wash it off with some cologne , and take the case and make sure it' s nice and pretty .
it' s corinthian leather .
billy , axel calling .
axel , listen .

i' m sure you can explain , or maybe you can' t explain , but you' ve got to turn yourself in .
i' m going to wonder world .
no !

axel !
put your arms out and hold for a pat down .
foley just arrived , sir .
take him to control .

let' s have the paper .
there' s a porsche by the front gate .
there' s a phone inside .

i don' t think so .
then we got a stalemate .
not quite .
orrin ...

the paper don' t mean jack shit .

axel , what are you doing here ?
what happened ?
it' s the coolant safety system .

the phone would just ring and ring .
that' s it .
what good would that be ?
a lot of good .
we can call flint' s pager .
foley is in hometown square .
repeat , foley is in hometown square .
foley is heading for alien attack .
