i was born in palermo , sicily .
we came to this country when i was seven .
we immigrated to chicago .
we were always raised to be very patriotic , to love our country .
and we did .
when i was a little boy , my father took me to a baseball game .
they had a martial arts demonstration and i saw this old japanese man ... ... doing things that i thought were magical ... ... and i developed a crazy dream to go to the far east .
by the time i was 17 , i was there , studying with the masters .
in 1969 i was invited by a friend of mine to an american embassy party in tokyo .
while i was there , there was a crazy , drunk guy named nelson fox .
he recruited me into the cla .
i was 22 at the time .
my eyes were about to be opened .
this is a nation of laws .
no one is above the law , no one is below the law .
and we' re going to enforce the law !
and americans should remember that , if we are to have law and order !
you ever seen chemical interrogation before ?
these assholes are agency ?
we all get paid by the cla .
but these guys are from a page that ain' t even in the book .
don' t die on me , you sucker !
what the hell' s wrong ?
this pussy , he just can' t hold his liquor .
doc , he' s dead .
get him the fuck out of here .
move it .
let' s go .
come on !
get him out .
get him out of here .
so , my little doctor bag doesn' t scare you ?
i' m not scared .
you speak english .
how nice .
where' s the load , colonel ?
i' m gonna teach you never ... ... never to fuck with my opium .
oh , boy .
he' s a hard one , doc .
you took it from the french , you took it from the chinks .
and you' il be damned if a yankee' s going to start you talking .
but you' re gonna sing for me .
you' re gonna sing like a choir !
what does this have to do with military intelligence ?
who the fuck is this cherry ?
your orders , toscani , were to assist and observe .
just back off , partner .
i' m gonna start cutting you off at the ankles .
then i' m gonna take your feet and throw them right in the basket .
cute , huh ?
shut up , nico .
look , i can make you disappear .
grab his leg .
what the hell are you doing , man ?
nico !
you think you' re soldiers ?
you' re fucking barbarians !
get out !
get back to the lz .
if i don' t cap him now , he' s gonna do me later .
i' il call a chopper in for us .
i' il cover this .
just get the hell out of here !
come on , move !
bring him back here !
nobody move !
everybody stay on that damn porch !
go , nico !
nelson , i' m through .
i' m finished !
nicola , sara , what name do you give your child ?
giuliano nicola .
giuliano ... ... you have become a new creation .
with the help of your family and friends ... ... we bring your christian dignity unstained ... ... into the everlasting life of heaven .
come on .
you always make me late .
i' m the boss .
you have to drive me !
i' il trace the sign of the cross upon your forehead ... ... and i invite your parents to do the same .
in the name of the father , the son ... ... and the holy spirit .
amen .

he' s such a good baby .

she goes to work looking like this ?
this girl , sometimes she comes in just lingerie .
don' t tell our secrets .
she' s never gonna let you out with me again .
i told you guys to have a good time , but take it easy , will you ?
toscani holds the record for having more relatives ... ... under federal indictment than any other cop in the city .

let' s go .
what do we got here ?
what kind of high is this ?
sky high .
military explosives .
c 4 , my man .
hey , boss ... ... you can see your place from the office of the fbl .
ain' t that something ?
your name again ?
agent neeley , chicago office .
the arresting officer , toscani .
what does he do ?
he' s a tac sergeant , cpd vice .
hold on a minute ...
i' il tell you what this cop is .
he' s a fucking menace .
he almost strangled me !
your problem is being taken care of right now .
it should' ve been handled 12 hours ago when my throat was in one piece !
somebody better get his wires straight .
you don' t know who you' re dealing with .
this maniac should be wearing a number , not a badge !
the director does not want a problem .
there won' t be one .
and i don' t want any problems .
i understand .
just listen .
they are to be released immediately .
you can count on it .
avoid all contacts .
you' il have the bureau' s full cooperation .
you' re free to go .
thank you very much , gentlemen .
good work .
i loved the face of that fbi guy when the call came through .
salvano .
i don' t want any more problems .
i don' t enjoy babysitting .
everything is going to be all right from now on .
i promise you , mr. zagon .
attention , please .
attention , everyone .
please , guys .
i just want to get a few things straightened out .
a few minutes ago , i received a call from the first deputy superintendent' s office .
as we all know , possession of these kinds of explosives is a federal offense ... ... and falls under the jurisdiction of the federal agencies represented here .
what kind of bullshit is that ?
the feds come in , the doors close , nobody hears , smells or sees anything .
and that' s no answer .
it' s no answer to why the biggest drug dealer in the city ... ... is out on the street as free as a fucking bird !
keep it in your pants , all right .
these men have a job to do , just like we do .
it' s their game , let them play it .
what i' m about to say does not leave this room .
is that clear ?
mr. salvano has been working for some time ... ... in cooperation with certain federal agencies .
i' m not at liberty to divulge the nature or extent of mr. salvano' s involvement .
i just learned of its existence myself a few hours ago .
one thing i can tell you is that mr. salvano' s role ... ... is crucial to an extremely sensitive , ongoing investigation .
any surveillance ... ... harassment or unauthorized operations against this individual are forbidden .
i order all of you , with due respect for your work and your courage ... ... to stand down .
why don' t you assholes stand down on this ?
you' re gonna need me .
need you .
for what ?
to get your ass out of jail .
you think you can afford my bail ?
no .
neither do i. not on this pay .
you' il end up in jail for a long time , i have the strangest feeling .
you' re jealous ' cause i' m gonna stay a cop .
what the fuck is this ?
go back to work .
here we go .
what are you thinking ?
isn' t this your mother' s church ?
yes , but i' il bet she hasn' t seen these boys in the choir .
hey , nico !
i can' t believe you' re in church without your family .
hello , father .
how are you ?
this must be your partner in crime .
delores jackson .
i' m father gennaro .
i saw you at the baptismal party .
nico , we gotta go !
no , please .
wait .
god , it' s good you' re here .
if you got a few minutes , there' s something i' d like to show you .
please .
i haven' t been down here since i was a kid .
what' s this ?
the rats are getting bigger .
when did this happen ?
two nights ago .
i didn' t call the police .
what do they want , the bingo receipts ?
these are friends .
father tomasino , this is nico .
mucho gusto , padre .
how do you do ?
sister mary .
hi , nico .
delores .
how do you do , father ?
seora , mucho gusto .
hello .
my friend , father tomasino , is working with the sanctuary movement .
he' s visiting ... ... helping his people work out some of their immigration problems .
sorry to have troubled you .
nico , we must go .
gracias .
nice meeting you , sir .
bye bye .
how long have those people been here ?
too long .
at least the children go to our school .
who do you think broke into the room ?
kids , maybe .
maybe worse .
it' s not the first time .
would you like us to send a car to check on you ?
no , please .
police frighten these people .
i know what you mean .
they frighten me , too .
it' s too far out of your way .
i can' t ask you to go to that much trouble .
look , i really don' t mind coming by .
promise , okay ?
all right ?
say , nico , by the way , when was your last confession ?
my last confession ?
i' m a married man .
i have no sins to confess .
you' re a police officer .
you got a lot of sins to confess .
he' s got your number !
is that your impression of police officers ?
i want to see you in church sunday , okay ?
i feel better when you' re in church , okay ?
you don' t show up , i' il call your mother !
i wish you would .
she loves you .
why don' t you go to church ?
it' il be good for you .
get your soul saved .
our leaders tell us ... ... and talk to us about them and us .
but almighty god talks to us ... ... about all of mankind ... ... as one .
now , we have an obligation ... ... to find out what is the truth .
we need to study .
we need to question .
we need to read and we need to find out ... ... what they are doing in our name .
and we must support those brave souls ... ... who seek ... ... the truth .
god bless us .
amen .
get down !
there' s nothing else we can do .
lord god , heavenly father ... ... receive the soul of our dear departed friend , father joseph gennaro .
come on .
get a list of everybody treated here today .
everybody .
find those sanctuary people ... ... the ones we found hiding in the bottom of the church .
i want to know where they' re from and who might want to harm them .
where are you gonna be ?
just stay by the radio .
i' il find you .
he didn' t make it .
oh , nico !
oh , no !
halloran , neeley .
sweetheart , go to the car .
i' il be right there , okay ?
take mama .
nico , you okay ?
how' s the family doing ?
excuse me .
i' d like to have a word with you .
alone .
what the hell is it ?
it' s you , that' s what the fuck it is !
keep your goddamn hands off me !
you let salvano walk .
salvano ?
yeah .
what are you , crazy ?
what does he have to do with this ?
that was no cherry bomb , that was c 4 .
i' ve used that shit .
i know what it smells like and what it blows like .
salvano never came near that c 4 .
it' s in federal holding right now .
besides , why would salvano blow up a church ?
i tailed him two days ago .
he and his goon were in that church and they weren' t taking communion .
i saw the woman who planted the bomb and she was with salvano' s lawyer .
now , i want some fucking answers .
you tailed him after i ordered you off ?
i want to know where salvano is .
my orders were to release him , not babysit him .
you think you' re rough stuff .
martial arts hero , chop suey crap !
let me tell you something .
you' re not bulletproof .
you' re not even a good cop .
you sneak around playing your street dick games ... ... and all you come up with is conjecture , wild coincidence and bullshit !
i want the name of the federal agent who signed for those explosives .
you do your job , i' il do mine .

come on , let' s go .
so you think i' m a bad cop , neeley ?
you know something ?
maybe i am .
but at least i don' t have my face buried up washington' s ass .
listen , toscani .
maybe i' ve judged you a little harshly .
i think you have .
and you know something ?
what i' d like to do , for the way you' ve treated me ... ... is treat you in a similar fashion .
i' d like you to get up ... ... run your ass over there and jump in the fucking lake .
if you don' t hurry , i' il empty this gun in your butt .

i got a crew coming in .
thanks .
we' il be done in a little while .
we don' t have much time .
they' re going to tear this goddamn place down in a matter of hours .
there' s no way to access covert operations directly ... ... but i got a guy at princeton .
he has a database bigger than langley .
how the hell did you get in this mess ?
i thought you were finished with the cla .
trap door .
we' il wriggle up these two ... ... operative dossiers .
start with my friend , nelson .
your friend has had a hell of a career .
give me the names of every agency man involved in this .
nico , what is going on here ?
here we go .
five agents from the central american desk .
all of them , trained assassins .
they' ve all come to chicago in the last week and they' re all still here .
they got the whole fucking killing team here .
it looks that way .
thanks .
i owe you one .
where are you going ?
i gotta find that priest .
be careful .
i find this totally incredulous .
you , being a station chief at the cla , didn' t know what was going on ?
mr. senator , i' d like to explain a few things .
either you perjured yourself earlier , or you' re lying to us now .
take a few moments before you answer this .
and remember that you' re under oath .
it was agreed this was a valuable asset and that i had to work out a way ... ... they had to work out a way in which to take over .
and did that include giving money to the enterprise ?
not insofar as i knew .
and the colonel never told you ?
no .
are you saying that this was going to be a donation for the cla ... ... as far as you were concerned ?
we were going to walk away from it .
hello .
oh , yes , sister .
yes .
sister mary , right .
no , there will be no problem .
now just calm down .
right , right .
now where are you ?
who is it ?
father !
get her out of here .
this way , father .
where did you find this guy ?
the nun from the daycare called .
she' s with the priest at a place on damon .
she saw two guys sneaking around the church and she got scared .
i got papers from that senator' s aide .
everything harrison has been working on .
it' s unbelievable .
it' s over at my place .
i need you to do me a favor .
stay out of it .
just stay in the car .
nico , far be it for me to complain ... ... but you got jax pulling burglaries .
you got me doing god only knows what .
when we hit the joint , i don' t want you celling with me .
jax , we' il work out something .
why don' t you go over there and sweet talk him ?
sure .
if i were you , i would listen to what this man has to say .
he knows what' s best for you .
you wouldn' t lie to me would you , father ?
it' s a sin .
look at me !
if you spoke to anyone about our plans to kill the senator ... ... tell me now ... ... and i won' t have to use this .
this is from confession .
i tell no one .
let' s go .
under no circumstances are you to come out of this car .
just stay here , all right ?
take a nice look at it .
i got it just for you .
do you feel that ?
nice ?
you like that ?
now you' re gonna start feeling something warm .
very warm and wonderful .

you' ve got to do it , nico .

mom , take him upstairs , will you ?

do you know why i love you ?
what it is about you that i' ve always loved ?
it' s pride .
but , nico , that pride may kill all of us .
swallow your pride .
choke on it , if you have to .
lay it down , please .
you know something ?
there' s nothing in this world that i wouldn' t do for my family .
nobody will harm us .
i don' t want you to worry .
okay ?
not even you can hit him at this range , nico .
that wasn' t the plan , nelson .
close range ?
it' d never work .
it' s rigged .
scanned every 35 seconds .
i was thinking of a claymore on the roof ...
no !
the roof is wired , too .
sensors every 15 feet .
okay .
now you can move .
it' s me .
you don' t have to treat me like ...
slow !
come on , let' s get the fuck out of here .
move !
slow .
you even look at me funny , you' re in the river , toscani .
i figured you' d do your recon from this building .
you' re looking fit .
i' m getting a bit of a tire .
is that your own tailor ?
hong kong .
you' ve come a long way .
yeah .
just walk .
i don' t believe you .
what' s so hard to believe ?
i want to help you , you dumb guinea .
i' ve been trying to talk some sense into you .
you' re still " fox the fixer .
if i wanted to cap you , i' d save myself all this damn chitchat .
i' d make big points for myself if i brought your scalp in .
shit , i' d be white house material .
is that what zagon is , one of your basement boys ?
zagon' s a rancher .
4, 000 acres in costa rica .
beautiful place .
beautiful place , huh ?
was that bought with opium money from the triangle ?
and a ton of coke a week from other places .
which he funnels here through salvano .
the company getting it' s cut , of course .
legal tender .
so war is still the greatest business , huh ?
these guys have started and financed every war we' ve ever fought .
nobody would believe me if i told them the bankers were the cla .
come on , toscani , don' t preach to me .
so the senator couldn' t be bought , could he ?
he was gonna expose your plans to invade nicaragua with your fucking coke money .
so the agency clears zagon to cap his ass , right ?
just keep walking , asshole .
so some poor , innocent priest finds out .
he comes here .
but you can' t kill the senator until you know if the " padre " has talked .
so zagon comes in , " tell me , " with his little doctor bag .
only by then , i' m in on it .
and you fucking know i' m gonna recognize his handiwork .
if your name would' ve been joe smith , i never would' ve caught it .
but how many nicola toscanis are there ?
tell me something , old buddy .
do we kill our own senators now ?
why not ?
the romans did .
are we the fucking romans ?
we' re an empire , too .
you don' t believe that shit for a minute .
just walk .
go !
hold it , nico .
here' s your key , sir .
my buddy will drive .
you know something ?
in europe , they' re trying some 80 year old camp guard for nazi war crimes .
all around our country , they got guys on death row ... ... for murdering one , two , three guys .
and they probably deserve what they' re gonna get .
but you and i ... ... we know people that are personally responsible ... ... for the death of 50, 000 non military personnel .
librarians , teachers , doctors , women , children , all dead .
we' ve wiped out entire cultures .
and for what ?
not one cla agent has ever been tried , much less accused , of any crimes .
you guys think you' re above the law , but you ain' t above mine .
nico , we don' t have time for this .
get in the goddamn car .
i' ve been waiting for the day i' d catch up with this motherfucker .
salvano and his scumbag dealer .
what a team we got here .
i told you , you' d never be the man .
nelson , we' ve been looking for you .
i see that you ... ... found our friend .
thanks , fox .
i didn' t bring him .
i swear it .
you two must have had a lot to talk about .
reminiscing about the good old days ?
stay still !
just fucking don' t move .
nelson , bring our friend in .
come on , be a good boy .
dive , nico !
get that motherfucker !
move it !

stop the car , you fuck !
stop the car , you piece of shit !

roger , spike leader .

i want him alive .
he' s clean .
bring him over .
let' s go !
we' re out of here .
abandon the vehicles and get out of here .
tommy , hurry up !
get in .
we' re out of here .
now , our honored guest , senator ernest harrison .
i hope this don' t take too long ' cause i' m getting hungry .
this is bullshit .
we' ve got work to do .
all work and no play makes jack a dull boy .
we' ve got an hour before we say good bye to the honorable senator .
you know , you' ve got to learn to take time to ... ... smell the roses .
how are you gonna do him ?
do him in the motorcade ... ... or pass him through a hotel kitchen ?
put his face up .
hold it up .
here you go , toscani . " dr. feelgood .
i' ve used these little beauties many times to extract information .
for the first time in my life ... ... i' m gonna do it just for the fun .
get the fuck away from me !
let him go .
toscani , my sleeping beauty ... ... you should' ve killed me when you had the chance .
you' re too fucking dumb , asshole .
jake !
look out !
say something .
nico ?
is there a doctor here ?
quick !
call an ambulance !
agent neeley , fbl .
we' ve got a problem , but we don' t know what it is , yet .
please , senator harrison , this way .
we are standing in front of the home of police sergeant nico toscani .
behind me , the entourage of senator harrison is arriving .
lots of security here .
we have police officers on the scene and federal agents .
of course , there is concern of a possible assassination attempt .
that' s why you' ve got so many law enforcement officers here .
this is senator harrison .
nico toscani .
how do you do ?
please , don' t get up .
detective toscani ... ... i just felt compelled to come and thank you personally ... ... and to assure you that we' il use every resource available ... ... to bring these men to justice ... ... and to ensure that this type of behavior will never be tolerated again .
that would be nice .
let me introduce roberta alspaugh of the fifth circuit court .
how do you do , ma' am ?
are you sure you' re well enough ?
i' m ready to talk if you' re ready to listen .
all right .
miss jackson , i' il leave you now .
senator , thank you .
we' il be leaving for washington .
hey buddy , we' il be back later .
mr. toscani ... ... can you tell us about your military background ?
in 1973 , i worked for a special operations group ... ... in vietnam and cambodia .
i was involved with gathering intelligence .
all of the members of this team were doctors recruited by the cla ... ... and trained at a secret camp in langley , virginia .
gentlemen , whenever you have a group of individuals ... ... who are beyond any investigation ... ... who can manipulate the press , judges , members of our congress ... ... you' il have within our government those who are above the law .
