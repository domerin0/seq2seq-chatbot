ah , the heckler & koch g 36 .
quite deadly in the right hands .
ah , agent one .
i have been so looking forward to this moment .
well , in that case , i' il try not to disappoint .
you overestimate your power over women , mr english .
i' d say that would be virtually impossible .
sir ?
sir ?
sir !

hmm ?
the mission documents .
agent one' s flying tonight .
yes , the mission documents .
they' re here somewhere .
ah , here we are .

your mission documents , agent one .
including the codes for the submarine hatch , which i' ve checked myself .

if i told you that , i' m afraid i' d have to kill you .
oh .
oh , yes , yes .
well , i expect you would .
cheerio , agent one .
bonne chance .
arrivederci .
such class .
such distinction .
ml7 all depts .
urgent agent one killed in action in biarritz .
submarine hatch failed to open .
the greatest secret agent england' s ever had snuffed out in an instant .
terrible .
do you know what makes us envied the world over , bough ?
that there' s always another agent waiting to step in .
absolutely , sir .
and every last one of them is gathered around that grave .
it is our honour and privilege to guard them while they grieve .
their lives are in our hands , bough .
everything in order , english ?
i think you' il find it' s rather more than just in order , sir .
you' re now entering the most secure location in the whole of england .
pegasus , we face a national crisis .
agent one was clearly onto something , and we have to find out what .
i need another agent on this .
who else is there ?
no one , prime minister .
they all died in the explosion .
all of them ?
well , luckily there is one who survived .
who ?
one eye on the shadows
protecting his fellows
from sunup till the moon on his back [ grunting ]
sendin ' villains to hades a hit with the ladies johnny english .
a stallion in the sack
you can' t get your life back when right follows left , jack [ groaning ]
the more you see the less you know
when others would leak it his service is secret
plays god when it' s your time to go
hey , fellas don' t bejealous
when they made him they broke the mould
so charismatic with an automatic
never prematurely shooting his load
hah !
queen and country safe and sound
with villains six feet underground
and no one knows ' cause no one' s found any trace
of a man for all seasons
loves ' em and leaves ' em alone
so alone
and you and i wouldn' t have a clue who' s doin ' what , why , when and who
up a creek with no canoe watch out
for the man for all seasons
loves ' em and leaves ' em alone
so alone
but safe at home but safe at home
oh , yeah , yeah but safe at home
but safe at home but safe at home
then you and i wouldn' t have a clue who' s doin ' what , why , when and who
up a creek with no canoe watch out
for the man for all seasons
loves ' em and leaves ' em alone , so alone
but safe at home
right .
johnny english .
i' m here to see pegasus .
still , no sense rushing things .
there are some items you need to sign before your briefing .
this is your new retinal i. d. card , and this is your level nine security clearance .
sign and date , please .
ah .
oh , reminds me of the old service issue ballpoint .
i remember every agent would carry a pen that looked just like this .
completely innocent to the untrained eye , but click it twice ...
ah , english , there you are .
have you seen my secretary ?
um ... she went out .
um ... shall we ?
now , agent one believed that there was a plot to steal the crown jewels .
they' ve recently been through a multimillion pound restoration ,
largely paid for by a corporate sponsor .
they' re due to be unveiled tonight at the tower of london .
the queen is insisting that the ceremony goes ahead , so what we want you to ...
hah !
who ...
who ...
who is the sponsor , sir ?
pascal sauvage .
what , that flouncy frenchman who owns a couple of prisons ?
sauvage' s $7 billion empire , english , operates over 400 prisons in 60 countries .
he' s built 25 of them here .
right , sir .
the man' s related to the royal family , for goodness' sake .
as far as the prime minister' s concerned , he' s one of the greatest friends england' s got .
now , english , i want you at the tower tonight , monitoring this unveiling .
any chink in security , any weakness , however slight , must be plugged immediately .
do we understand each other ?
perfectly , sir .
good .
oh , yes .
and , uh , english ... we can' t afford any mistakes ... not tonight .
the word " mistake , " sir , is not one that appears in my dictionary .
the tower of london
fantastic car , sir !
mr english , colonel sir anthony chevenix , head of royal security .
ah , colonel , good evening .
snipers posted on the roof as per my request ?
thirteen of them .
windows ?
refitted with bullet and shatter proof glass .
i shall now mingle inconspicuously with the guests .
let me know when her majesty arrives .
very good .
shall i mingle with you , sir ?
oh , yes , bough .
once you' ve checked the roof .
help !
help !
well , hello .
hello yourself .
johnny english .
lorna campbell .
a bloody mary , please , not too spicy .
so , are you here in some professional capacity ?
i worked on the restoration of the jewels .
intriguing .
and yourself ?
if i told you that , i' m afraid i' d have to kill you .
i' d like to see you try .
monsieur sauvage , on behalf of her majesty , may i welcome you to the tower .
merci , monsieur .
so , are you here alone , mr english ?
that' s how i choose to live my life , miss campbell .
women want safety , security .
i can offer them nothing but danger .
some women find danger very attractive .
women like you , miss campbell ?
women like me expect men like you ... to find that out for yourself .
hmm .
madame .
oh , it' s for me , actually .
could your rustle up some of those cheesy niblets ?
now , where were we ?
you obviously haven' t met our host , monsieur sauvage .
no , thank god .
you know , i think i' d rather have my bottom impaled on a giant cactus ... than exchange pleasantries with that jumped up frenchman .
as far as i' m concerned , the only thing the french should host is an invasion .
sorry , can i help ?
pascal sauvage , jumped up frenchman .
lorna campbell .
i' ve been so looking forward to meeting you .
enchante .
but of course !
you' re johnny english .
i' ve heard all about you .
and between you and me , i' m not so keen on the french myself .
but please don' t tell them that .
let me go and search for your nibbly cheese bits .
no , no , no .
l ...
i insist .
the french are , after all , fantastic waiters .
the best in the world .
well ...
but but ...
wait here , and i will wait on you .
no , really .
there' s no ...
no .
please , please , please !
hmm .
les francais .
ils sont very ... n' est ce pas ?
ladies and gentlemen , mesdames est messieurs , bienvenus , welcome tonight to this wonderful occasion .
as we stand here in the tower of london , the most famous prison in the world , where these wonderful jewels will rest safely ... under lock and key ,
i want to thank you ... for giving me this wonderful experience ... to contribute to the restoration of these jewels .
it was , as we say in france , le top , le best of .
and what a beautiful ...
it' s colonel chevenix !
he' s got a nasty wound , sir .
who hit him ?
the assailant .
he ran in here .
bough , you guard the door .
aha !
for god' s sake , bough , don' t come in .
the man' s a maniac !
you don' t frighten me !
missed !
i' ve managed to subdue the assailant .
the panic' s over .
everything' s under control .
thank you .
and now , ladies and gentlemen , we should compose ourselves for the arrival of her majesty ... and return to the site of our great nation' s ... magnificently restored crown jewels .
i know .
i feel it too .
the very symbols of our island nation , so close we could almost reach out and ...
pray silence for her majesty the queen .
oh , where are thejewels ?
it' s an unmitigated disaster , english .
i couldn' t agree more , sir .
well , we need to get these jewels back , english , and fast .
tell me about this assailant .
when they searched the room , there was no sign of him .
well , the man was clearly a professional .
he must have escaped while the queen was being sedated .
but he' s the only lead we' ve got .
we have to find him .
come in .
this is ...
this is roger from data support .
please sit down .
he' il produce a likeness based on your description .
so tell us , what did this man look like ?
um ... well ... he was ... big .
hair colour ?
um ... orange .
orange ?
mmm .
and curly .
well , frizzy , actually .
frizzy sort of thing .
frizzy .
an eyepatch .
broken nose .
very few teeth .
two , i would say , at the most .
and a scar on his cheek ... in the shape ... of a banana .
which cheek ?
both cheeks .
they sort of met in the middle .
are you sure about this , english ?
oh , yes , that' s him .
an uncanny resemblance .
why , it' s just as if he' s in the room with us .
wow !
look at this , sir .
got all the bells and whistles .
never mind about the gadgets .
just focus on the case .
oh , uh ...
good morning , gentlemen .
thank you very much for waiting .
now , the question that faces us this morning is a simple one .
namely , how did the thieves gain access to this highly secure environment ... and then escape with thejewels afterwards ?
a simple question , but one which i believe has a complex answer .
actually , sir ...
uh , please , bough .
my mind is at work .
now , what you must grasp , gentlemen , is that the master criminal ... sees not a room but a series of opportunities .
should i go in through the window ?
possibly .
should i drop down from the ceiling ?
actually , sir ...
there' s one thing i think we can be fairly confident about , that is that they didn' t come up through the floor ...
i' ve got you , sir .
that' s all right .
just come my way , bough .
that' il bring me right over the hole , sir .
there' s no need to panic .
can you see the bottom yet , bough ?
not yet , sir .
the shaft appears to be narrowing .
i' m just a little bit worried i might get stuck .
trust me , bough .
you won' t get stuck if you just keep moving .
yes , sir .
i' m okay , sir .
are you at the bottom now , bough ?
no , i am in fact stuck now , sir .
oh , for god' s sake , bough .
stay there !
i' m coming down .
uh , i' m not especially sure that' s a good idea , sir .
don' t worry .
be careful , sir !
gently does it .
sir ?
are you all right , sir ?
yes .
i landed on something quite soft .
that was me , sir .
oh , good .
what now ?
there' s no way back up there , that' s for sure .
but this must lead somewhere .
i' m slightly uncomfortable in the dark , sir .
there' s nothing to worry about , bough .
it may be pitch black , but we can still see .
can we , sir ?
how ?
the bedouin monks of the al maghreb mountains ... developed a system of sonic chanting .
i see , sir .
the sound of their chanting ... would bounce back off any obstacles , and using their highly tuned ears ... they could paint a mental picture of the path ahead .
brilliant , sir .
however , you must always sing in e flat .
e flat , e flat , e flat
thank you for the music the songs i' m singing
is it working , sir ?
extremely well , thank you , bough .
thanks for all the joy that ...
ow !
you all right , sir ?
i think i can see something , sir .
oh , yeah .
come on .
here is the long one .
it is a long one .
careful .
i knew it .
shall we call for backup , sir ?
what ?
and watch some fat bottomed bobby make our arrest for us ?
i don' t think so .
good morning , gentlemen .
ml7 at your service .
observe , bough , the dull incompetence of the criminal mind .
it can never hope to match our level of technical expertise .
you' ve got it .
what do we do now , sir ?
watch and learn , bough .
they' re too far ahead of us .
have faith , bough .
they' re heading south .
there they are , sir !
just as i thought .
hang on tight , bough .
we' re never gonna catch them in this .
take the wheel , bough .
i' m getting in the aston .
sir ?
change places , bough .
i' m getting out the other side .
sir ?
set , bough .
take me up .
swing me out , bough !
whoa .
down .
up !
up !
sorry !
bough , pull out !
ow !
ow !
those idiots are right behind us .
faster !
uh huh .
drop me here , bough !
ow !
oh .
no !
no !
no !
oh , no , no , no , no , no , no .
they' re turning into the brompton cemetery .
get here as soon as you can .
i' m going in .
in a wheelchair .
but geoffrey overcame these terrible disabilities ... with that simple resilience and sunny optimism ... that so warmed all of us who knew him , spending the rest of his life in the service ... of the poor and disabled of this parish .
it' s very good .
really very good .
no , no , please go on .
i' m sorry to interrupt .
it' s very entertaining .
who' s that ?
that priest act of yours should keep the other prisoners entertained for hours .
oh , i' m so sorry .
where are my manners ?
johnny english ,
british secret service , and you are all under arrest .
i must say you' ve done this whole thing very well .
the attention to detail is excellent .
you , the grieving granny , you' re very convincing .
oh , look .
real tears .
do you get paid extra for that ?
ahh , what we' re all here for .
i know !
why don' t we take a look inside ?
oh , you' ve nailed it down !
why would you do that ?
i know you' re gonna come back in two weeks and dig it up again .
now , what are you playing in this little vignette of deceit and villainy ?
i' m the hearse driver .
you' re the hearse driver ?
yes , sir .
you' re the hearse driver ?
yes , sir .
ah !
aha !
there you are ...
gunther .
uh , i do hope he hasn' t made a nuisance of himself .
i' m doctor , um ...
bough , of the lunatic response unit .
i' m afraid gunther here wasn' t supposed to be released until 2028 .
isn' t that right , gunther ?
yes , yes , there' s been the most monumental cock up .
um , if you' il excuse me , with the deepest respect , utmost sympathy .
uh , he hasn' t urinated on anyone , has he ?
no .
no , no .
that' s a blessing .
are you gonna give me the gun , gunther ?
there .
that wasn' t too difficult , was it ?
are you going to come home now ?
oh ... in the van !
yes , we are going in the van .
yes , yes .
vroom , vroom .
vroom , vroom .
vroom , vroom .
yes .
yeah .
yes .
he' s waving good bye .
good bye , everyone .
good bye .
good bye , gunther .
mind the nice dead people .
there we go .
oh , we' il just go to the path here .
there .
big step .
it' s a graveyard .
it' s where they bring people ...
yes , all right .
you can stop now .
for appearances , i' il just hold your arm .
just keep walking .
in fact , run , run , run !
i can' t believe i' ve done this .
i mean , i really cannot believe i' ve done this !
you see , 200 years ago , my family should have inherited the throne of england , but they were cast aside .
well , in a few very short days , it will be back where it belongs .
with me .
shall i try it on ?
yes ?
no ?
maybe ?
to make you king , we need the archbishop of canterbury to do that .
the archbishop of canterbury ... is being taken care of even as we speak .
target acqulred
target locked
there' s only one thing , sir .
what are we going to do about english ?
if i were you , i wouldn' t worry too much about english .
he is no threat to us .
i had his flat bugged .
clearly , the aptly named english is a fool .
he might be a fool , but he' s a fool who keeps showing up .
well , the next time he shows up , eliminate him .
thank you .
dieter klein and klaus vendetta , sir .
released from prison six months ago .
327 convictions between them .
armed robbery , grievous bodily harm ... and combined parking fines of more than 400 ...
uh , yes , all right .
thank you , bough .
i think we get the picture .
the point is , sir , that vendetta and klein ... are both in the employ of monsieur sauvage .
pascal sauvage ?
precisely , sir .
but you' re not suggesting sauvage is involved ?
i think he' s more than just involved , sir .
i' m convinced he' s up to his french neck in it .
don' t be absurd .
sauvage employs thousands of people .
just because two of them are villains doesn' t mean that he is .
i want him discounted from this investigation immediately .
yes , sir .
all right .
tonight i shall be at sauvage' s reception for the new french ambassador .
any developments , you can reach me there .
apart from that , i don' t want you within a hundred miles of the man .
absolutely , sir .
ml7 quartermasters for immediate supply ; one military transport plane , fully fueled , with permission for nighttime city over flight ; two night camouflage parachutes , plus reserves , plus neoprene bodysuits , twice , in black .
i' ve never liked the navy blue .
and a 40 inch chest for me ' cause i need the sleeve length .
morning , felch .
morning .
oh , and two special forces signet rings , primed and colour coded .
what' s all this for ?
for tonight' s operation .
we' re going to break into sauvage' s headquarters .
but pegasus said ...
let me worry about pegasus .
i know that sauvage is behind all this , and tonight we' re going to get the evidence .
is something wrong , sir ?
did that sound like felch to you ?
bough ...
you , upstairs .
ow .
can you see him , bough ?
he' s on the upper level , sir .
got him .
and like a coiled viper ... he strikes .
so what you' re saying , sir , is there must have been two of them ?
oh , at least , bough .
possibly four .
i wonder why i didn' t see them .
you mustn' t dwell on your mistakes .
you must learn from them , then move on .
yes , sir .
so where were you , sir ?
just drop it , bough !
aah !
what is it , sir ?
that bike .
you get things sorted out for tonight .
well , well , we meet again .
mr english .
what a pleasant surprise .
i wondered when you might show up again .
on the contrary , miss campbell .
it is not i who keeps showing up .
it' s you .
do you like sushi ?
hmm ?
oh , sushi !
i practically live off the stuff .
you might say the mysteries of the orient are no mystery to me .
sake ?
ah .
sake .
cheers .
may all your daughters be born with three bottoms .
now then , perhaps you can explain how it is ... that i run into you at two crime scenes ... and then can' t find any record of you on a single government computer .
shouldn' t you ask the government that ?
i am the government and i' m asking you .
let me .
mmm .
you' re brave .
they say that sea urchin' s the ultimate acquired taste .
hmm .
it' s a personal favourite of mine .
i think people are put off by how it feeds through its bottom .
would you excuse me for a moment ?
excuse me .
sorry .
i' m from ml7 .
sorry .
i' m a secret agent .
everything set , bough ?
just about , sir .
actually , sir , do you mind if i run through the plan one more time ?
no , no .
these are the two buildings here .
this one is our target , sauvage' s headquarters , next to city hospital .
i jump first and land on the south side of the roof , abseil down 14 floors and cut through this window here .
i then land on the east side and abseil down 12 floors .
where you wait for my signal that i' ve disabled the alarm system .
yes .
you them break into this window here , work your way along the secure corridor and penetrate sauvage' s office .
yes , yes .
is that okay , sir ?
it' s been okay ever since i thought up the idea , bough .
oh , i nearly forgot , sir .
your laser beacon .
my what ?
your laser beacon !
it' il guide you onto sauvage' s building .
your dependence on hardware really does amuse me , bough .
i' ve been dropped into the kalahari desert ... carrying nothing more than a toothbrush and a packet of sherbet lemons , and i still found my way to bulawayo before ramadan .
so thank you , bough , but no thank you .
bough , go !
geronimo !
fandango !
ugh !
ai yi yi .
right .
alarm' s disabled , sir .
roger that , bough .
this is worse than i thought , bough .
sauvage has got some kind of laboratory set up here .
god knows what kind of sick operation he' s running .
my god , what have they done to you ?
they' ve taken some of my blood .
bastards !
it' s only for tests .
of course it is .
come on , my friend .
let' s get you out of here before they take anything else .
ah !
good evening , dr frankenstein .
this way , please .
come on .
i haven' t got all night .
and you , you angels of death .
about turn .
come on , let' s go .
come on , come on .
keep moving .
come on .
over there .
i know what you' re doing here .
and you .
come on .
quicker .
quicker .
over there .
now then , perhaps you could direct me to your evil paymaster .
what are you talking about ?
you know exactly what i' m talking about .
where is the office of pascal sauvage ?
are you coming over here in a minute , sir ?
i' m from ml7 .
this has been a test of your emergency response systems , and i have to say you' ve all done extremely well .
right .
well , i' il leave you to it .
and , uh , get well soon .
oh , god !
sir .
sir .
did you just land on the wrong building ?
i did a precautionary sweep of the immediate environment .
right .
and everything was fine .
good .
okay , let' s go .
i will be downstairs at the reception ...
that' s far enough .
well , good evening .
perhaps you' d like this as well .
what is it ?
let me show you .
aah !
well executed , bough , but completely redundant .
how do you mean , sir ?
super strength muscle relaxant .
when he wakes up , he' il be as floppy as a damp old sock .
what' s this ?
that' s the face of the archbishop of canterbury .
what are they doing ?
what' s this got to do with the crown jewels ?
bough .
english .
a people whose empire once covered ... one quarter of the surface of the earth .
alas , no longer .
my friends ask me , " pascal , how can you be so interested ... in such a backward , grotty little country ?
the queen .
the queen has more power in her tiny white gloves ... than any other head of state in the entire world .
she can declare war or make peace , and most intriguingly ... she can seize any piece of land which takes her fancy .
of course , the queen never uses ... the enormous power afforded to her .
but imagine someone who would use that power .
imagine , say , me .
but how could he do that , sir ?
how could he make himself king ?
the archbishop .
ow .
hands up .
there' s a good fellow .
heavily armed for a late night at the office .
you fool , english .
you' il never get out of the building alive .
i' d save your breath for my questioning .
i' m not telling you anything .
incorrect .
sodium pentothal .
i won' t lie to you .
it' s a truth serum .
now then , why does sauvage want to have himself crowned ?
you have no idea what' s going on here , do you ?
it would be funny if it wasn' t so " pablibblit .
what ?
he' s talking gibberish , sir .
i can hear that .
he' s collapsed onto me , sir .
i can see that .
you don' t think you could' ve got the syringes mixed up ?
what ?
given the guard outside truth serum and given klein the muscle relaxant ?
aah !
don' t be ridiculous , bough .
i think i know my right from my left .
sir ?
oh , bugger it .
bough , take " flodd .
take what , sir ?
" flodd . " " schlage .
i' m not quite getting that second word , sir .
" schlaaaagh !
write it down , sir .
" schlaaaagh !
yes !
c. " c a ...
uh ...
car !
take the car !
we came by plane .
bugger off !
hold it right there .
what' s wrong with them ?
i' m not telling you .
wrong answer .
what is it with you two ?
huh ?
let' s get outta here .
sorry , but who are you , exactly ?
special agent campbell .
i' m attached to interpol in paris .
we' ve been watching sauvage for months .
why ?
because every major convict released from a sauvage prison in six months ... has been employed by one of his companies .
we believe he' s recruiting them for a major criminal conspiracy .
we just don' t know what yet .
what did he say ?
pegasus !
we have to report to pegasus !
oh , no , sir .
no , no , no .
how do we get out of here ?
hey , you two !
what you did to me really hurt .
yeah .
sorry about that .
how do we get out of here without being seen ?
okay .
left by the fountain , right by the fire exit , to the elevator at the end .
thank you .
oh , my god .
nice job , bough .
left , sir .
left !
sir , you can' t go to sauvage' s reception in this state .
the effect of the drug has practically worn off .
i' m " fline " ...
schline " ... uh , " gline " ...
monsieur .
ah .
thank you .
would you like another ?
please .
thank you .
what in god' s name ...
ah , foreign " sebretarary .
um ...
aah !
shall we dance ?
excuse me , sir .
i' m very sorry to interrupt ...
pascal , how nice to see you again .
enjoying the party ?
oh , splendid affair .
i was until i was informed that your man english ... and his curious boyfriend here have spent the evening ... breaking into my office and assaulting my staff .
is this true , bough ?
well , we ... we ...
what do you think you' re up to ?
sir , if i could just offer ...
go home , bough !
now !
i gave you direct orders not to meddle with sauvage .
what do you do ?
break into his office and assault two of his staff .
then you march in here , loaded with god knows what , and insult the foreign secretary .
i haven' t encountered such behaviour in whitehall in 30 years .
but ...
there are no " buts , " english .
you' re off the case .
your security clearance is hereby cancelled .
after a three month leave of absence , you will return at your old grade .
and i hope never to hear your name again .
english has seen too much .
we go to plan " b.
get rid of the fake archbishop ... and green light the visit to her majesty .
then this pathetic country can humiliate itself ... by crowning me officially .
the queen' s resldence at sandrlngham
that' s a letter of abdication ... renouncing your claims to the throne ... and the claims of your entire family .
sign it .
never .
yes ?
prime minister , sorry to call so late , but i' m afraid the queen is abdicating .
what ?
abdicated ?
but that' s not possible .
i only wish that were true .
let me talk to her .
maybe she just ...
pascal , she' s gone .
my people have spent the last 10 hours ... trying to track down the rightful heir to the throne ... and they' ve come up with a name , which they' ve double checked .
who is it ?
it' s you .
no !
in the wake of the return of the crown jewels ... to a police station in north london ,
pascal sauvage has requested that his coronation ... take place this thursday .
in the house , the prime minister said he was looking forward to the ceremony ... and he believed that monsieur sauvage will make a fine king ... and will bring all that is best about modern europe to our ancient institutions .
get your car keys .
we' ve got work to do .
miss campbell .
sauvage is heading back to france .
he' s invited 13 of the richest criminal masterminds in the world to meet him there .
i' m sorry , miss campbell .
i' m off the case .
it' s been reassigned .
i know .
reassigned to me .
i want you with me .
just leave me alone .
are you gonna sit here in this grotty flat feeling sorry for yourself ?
or are you gonna get out there and save your country ?
i' m gonna sit in the flat .
johnny , this is ridiculous .
i' m a spent force .
spent , my ass .
ow .
will ... you ... please ... stop ?
i' il just be a minute .
northern france
it' il be nightfall in an hour .
then we can strike out for the chateau .
the fact is , the moment sauvage gets that crown on his head , he' il be able to do whatever he likes with the country that i love , and that is why you and i have got to stop him .
relishing the thought ?
something like that .
i suppose you' ve made love to lots of women , haven' t you , johnny ?
uh ...
uh , well , you know , one does one' s best .
it' s just ...
well , it' s been three years since my fiance left me , and since then i haven' t made love to anyone .
but then i met you ... and i felt this ... hunger ... deep down inside .
i wanted to say things to you , i wanted to do things to you ... that i haven' t wanted to do in a very , very , very long time .
what , uh ...
what sort of things are we talking about ?
things like punching you in the face , kicking you in the backside for being such a pompous , know nothing asshole .
but then i started to see beyond the idiot that everybody else saw .
i started to see the man on the inside ... who was determined to do his duty , no matter what or who lay in his way .
and i began to feel other things for him , to want to do other things for him .
things ... involving plastic toys and soft cheese ?
what ?
what ?
what ?
you' re toying with me .
you' re telling me to stop in the gentlest way you know how .
no .
n n no ...
you' re such a special person ... not to take advantage of me while i' m vulnerable .
n no ...
well ...
so thank you ... for being such a gentleman .
not at all .
i know what you' re thinking , miss campbell .
if we don' t pull this off , god knows what might happen to england .
actually , i was thinking there must be a better way in than that pipe .
well , there isn' t .
i' ve analysed it from every angle , and this is the best option .
i' il go in first , and if it' s a clear way through , i' il call down .
johnny .
be careful .
i' m always careful .
ohh .
gentlemen .
in a few hours time ...
i will become the next king of england .
oh , no .
hyah ...
how did you get here ?
up the ladder .
pull yourself together .
it' s only a bit of poo .
oh !
oh , it' s cold !
it' s cold !
what is the one commodity ... the world never seems to run out of ?
criminals , gentlemen .
lawbreakers .
every nation in the world struggles ... with the issue of overcrowded prisons .
so , what do we do with all these villains ?
find the solution to that problem ... and the governments of the world would pay you through their nose .
fortunately , i have found a solution .
we empty every prison on the entire planet , we take the resulting tidal wave of human scum ... and we put it here .
the moment i am crowned king ,
i will turn england into the largest prison ... in the history of the world .
210, 000 square miles ... of prime real estate ... conveniently separated from true civilization ... by 20 miles of ocean ...
and soon to be available ...
come on .
for the entire world to dump its human waste in .
according to current projections , we will not run out of prison space for the next 500 years .
so , tonight one , and only one , of you ... will leave here owning 49 percent ... of this venture .
so that' s his little game .
we must get hold of that dvd .
but how , johnny ?
there' s only two of us .
you' re young , miss campbell , and inexperienced .
what you seem to have forgotten is that ...
nobody knows we are here .
at our disposal we have the vital element of surprise .
now , my plan is simple but effective .
i shall drop from the gallery at this end of the room and take sauvage prisoner .
you will then enter from the far door , cutting off any means of escape .
then , using sauvage as a hostage , we' il get the hell out of here .
clear ?
get ' em up , you french ponce .
but , mr english , i' m gobsmacked !
what an unexpected surprise .
surprises are very much my speciality , sauvage .
i think we' ve seen enough of this .
i know exactly what you' re planning , and i' m here to put a stop to it .
my bottom will be king of england before you are .
wrong again .
perhaps you' d care to look behind you .
oh , please .
lorna !
i' m sorry , johnny .
well , i' m afraid that we' il have to ... conclude the floor show for tonight .
not so fast , sauvage .
you may have taken me , but you' il never take england .
not as long as i have breath in my body ... or a bullet in my gun .
you know , mr english , i' m going to miss you .
really .
you' re very entertaining .
i thank you .
take them away .
good morning , everybody , and welcome to the breakfast show .
as the crowds are gathering here for the crowning of our first french king ... since the year 1066 , call here at london fm with the top ten things you most love about the french .
we haven' t had any calls yet , uh , at all , but the lines are still open and i' il give you that number again ... 0 2 0 7 ... zero , deux , zero , sept ...
this is not good , johnny .
we' ve got to think of something .
wait a minute .
i' ve got an idea .
hop !
hop !
and hop !
and hop !
and stop !
now , are you familiar ... with the shaman throat warblers of the guatemalan delta ?
what ?
it has long been their belief ... that a whistle pitched at the precise resonant frequency of a metal lock ... will vibrate the levers in such a way that the door will simply swing open .
unbelievable .
and kneel .
right .
here goes .
ascending tone ]
i can' t hear anything .
i' m into ultrasonic .
will you just stop all this and face facts ?
we' ve failed .
the only thing that can save us now is a miracle .
it worked !
ohh !
sir ?
i don' t know why you hauled yourself up that dreadful poo tube , bough , when there was a perfectly good ladder right beside it .
now , sauvage may have fooled the country ... with his fake archbishop and his secret agenda , but he hasn' t fooled me .
so , here' s the plan .
majestic ]
let all good people rejoice
rejoice
rejoice aaah !
let all good people rejoice
rejoice
rejoice
rejoice
rejoice
rejoice
and sing
sirs , you are hereby called to witness the anointing ... of your one true lord and future king pascal .
pascal , are you willing to take the oath ?
i am willing .
then be thou anointed ... with this holy oil .
and do you , the chosen bishops of england , scotland and wales , ascent to this anointing ?
for scotland , i do .
for wales , i do .
for england , i do not !
english !
that man must not be crowned king because he is ... a fraudster , a charlatan and a thief .
no , please .
let him speak .
it is this man , pascal sauvage , who stole the crown jewels , who forced the queen to abdicate ... and who would kill anyone who got in his way .
it is the end , herr english .
he has cheated , conned and manipulated ... this great country for his own ends .
he' s fooled you all !
what' s more , this whole ceremony is a sham ... because that man standing in front of you ... is not the archbishop of canterbury .
don' t go there .
shut it , frenchy .
i' il go wherever i damn well please .
now take it off .
what ?
your face is made of plastic .
remove it at once .
i have no idea what you' re talking about .
right .
i' il just have to remove it myself .
come on !
maybe it pulls up from the front .
come on , you !
aaah !
thank you very much .
must be a join here somewhere .
fascinating performance as always , monsieur english , but i' m afraid we must move on .
nobody' s moving anywhere until i' m finished with this piece of low life .
do you or do you you not ... have tattooed on your bottom the words ,
jesus is coming ...
look busy " ?
are you insane ?
well , let' s find out , shall we ?
go on , over .
let' s have a look .
excellent !
all right , so i was wrong about the archbishop' s bottom .
but there' s more .
but not , i' m afraid , today .
sergeant , please take this man away .
but be gentle with him .
do you think that' s it ?
you think i don' t have more evidence ?
my loyal subordinate is standing by with a dvd ... which shows sauvage' s hideous plans for this country .
get him out !
get him out of here !
play it , bough !
play the disk !
play it !
now !
you' re so hot teasing me
so you' re blue , but i can' t take a chance on a chick like you
it' s somethin ' i couldn' t do
well , i can dance with you , honey if you think it' s funny
does your mother know that you' re out
and i could shout with you , baby flirt a little , maybe
does your mother know that you' re out
take it easy take it easy
better slow down , girl that' s no way to go
does your mother know
oi !
hey !
well , shall we ?
then as solomon was anointed king ... by zadok the priest and nathan the prophet , so be thou anointed ... and consecrated king ... over all the peoples ... whom the lord thy god ... hath given thee to govern ... and of all your possessions , wherever they may be .
and so , in the name of the father ... and of the son ... and of the holy ghost ,
i crown you ...
damn it !
give it back !
no !
that is my crown !
never !
give it back !
never in a million years , sauvage !
give it to me !
get off .
merde !
give it back !
stop !
shut up !
all this stupid little country have to do is stand in line ... and do what it' s told for one miserable day !
but can it do that ?
my fragrant french ass , it can !
merde !
aah !
give it !
the crown , eh ?
the crown !
go !
and so , in the name of the father ... and of the son and of the holy ghost ,
i crown you ... king .
what ...
arrest that man ... and lock him away .
god save the king long live the king
god save the king
amen , amen , amen , amen amen , amen
ahh , amen , amen amen , hallelujah
amen
god save the king
words can hardly express just how much we appreciate everything you' ve done .
nothing more than my duty , ma' am .
and in return , is there anything that your queen and country can do for you ?
well , since one is asking , ma' am ...
in celebration of her return to the throne , the queen has declared august 5 a national holiday ... and has conferred a knighthood on the unnamed ml7 agent ... responsible for foiling the plot of french businessman pascal sauvage .
mr sauvage is now awaiting trial for high treason , a crime which still carries the death penalty .
if found guilty , he' s asked that his brain be donated to medical science ... to further research into the causes of hyper manic schizophrenia .
meanwhile , the unnamed english agent has left the country ... and has already embarked on his next challenging mission .
somewhere in the south of france
