you' re the first , hopefully not the last .
that bastard skinner , alot to answer for .
skinner ?
no ?
me !
you ?
you don' t know the half of it .
the phantom is m !
and the hunt is still on .
what are you talking about ?
the phantom is m !
the very man who recruited us .
let me see it , come ....
but , how get our answers ?
where are the others ?
dorian is missing in action ! ...
and mr. skinner must have fled when he realised we knew .
and sawyer ?
he' il live to fight another day .
don' t worry , i' ve had my full of throats for this evening .
come !
it was grey .
not skinner .
grey' s tricked us all .
what is it ?
the sound of traitory !
what is that thing ?
my exploration pond .
we could track it .
i intend to catch it !
that is us !
that is the north loid .
we will be upon them soon .
you' re okay ?
i' m just a little shaken .
nemo ?
it' s nothing of mine .
captain !
the noise came from this .
a recording disc ?
ready professor ?
it' s recording .
gentlemen .
if you' re hearing this , then every step leading up to it is gone as planned .
and i' ve intruded the goals set to me !
yes it' s me dorian .
as you know by now , i' m no loyal son of the empire .
in fact my loyalty to mr. m. comes in no small part from his possession of
something i hold very dear to my heart .
something i would do anything to regain .
are you allright ?
my ears hurt , it' s nothing .
everything so far has been misdirections .
sanderson read .
the assassins in kenya ... ... the recruitment in mission .
a myth !
there is no league !
there never was .
it was a use to get me closer to my goals .
he likes the sound of his own voice , doesn' t he ?
you see , i want you , each of you .
even tired old quartermain .
because he will capture hyde , where all others have failed .
the question is why , why all this mask and mystery ?
the power of the league itself !
oh , turn it off henry .
please turn it off .
to that end , i set my wolf among you sheep .
growl !
who gained your trust .
quietly lead you astray .
and all the while i' il collect you , the parts of you i need .
nemo' s science .
magnesium phosphoros .
skinners skin sample .
augh , you scratched me !
jekyil' s potion .
and mina' s blood .
he' s stolen us .
and we let him !
if you fail to save venice , then i get my war .
if you succeed , well it' s a small price to pay for the great of your body' s tasks .
war will come , sooner or later .
as inevitable as someone interward .
now some of you , perhaps caused too many years of death ...
will pause to ask why i' m letting you know all this .
what fool reveals his strategy before the games .
it is over ... for you !
because my voice isn' t the only sound being made .
while i rabbled on ... ...
a secondly layer of inaudible sounds , higher than humans can hear , laudable to dogs ,
those sounds have been heard by crystal censors , dotted about your wessel .
sencors attacted to bombs !
bomb voyage !
out of the way .
we have to surface .
we' re taking in too much water .
the controls are not responding .
primary engine room are almost full .
the bulk gate is open .
pumps are jammed .
seal it off .
but we can' t reach it captain .
for the greater good , we must seal it !
we control the tank .
what are you talking about ?
you know we can control it .
together !
seal it .
seal it off .
hold it , wait .
don' t close it !
what are you doing ?
it' s our last chance .
but i ordered to close it .
then close it !
bravo it worked .
bravo .
let' s not make a saint out of a sinner .
next time we may not be so helpful .
can we still follow grey ?
well we were the faster , but now we' re in a sour distance to his hair .
so we' re done ?
no , we' re alive !
if m has any idea of the contrary , then i guess it' s an edge .
we' re getting a signal .
morse code !
what' s it saying ?
hello my freaky darlings " .
skinner ?
hiding onboard little fish with grey and m " ... ... " on way to base , east by northeast , follow my lead " .
good work ... all of you .
captain ?
all ahead , full !
if skinners headings are correct , we will pass through the traiterous straights of tartari , and enter the amur river , which empty' s out into the frozen lakes of mongolia .
virtually inaccessable to outsiders .
passing settlements .
they' re all deserted .
why deserted ?
fear no doubt .
m' s summer retreat .
this is for us a signal they meet .
so we wait .
skinner ?
we heard a noise ?
it was nothing .
just an old tiger sensing his end .
perhaps this was not his time to die after all .
i' ve been waiting a whole week to do that .
get a grip , man !
well i thought i just did .
oh mina .
report !
well hallo to you too .
and need i remind you , i am naked in the snow .
i can' t feel any of my extremeties , and i mean , any of them .
with all the suspiscion on the ship , i knew you wouldn' t believe i wasn' t the spy .
well , i thought it was best to disappear .
so what are we dealing with ?
the fortress is vast .
furnaces produce iron for making m' s weapons of destruction .
they are pieced together on the factory floor by an army of ruthless men who share his vision .
but the worst was to come .
in the dry dock m' s best minds , perverting a dream .
the nautilus ?
nautiloi , there' s eight for now .
what about the kidnapped scientists ?
m holds their families hostage .
the men work , or the women and children die .
monstrous .
but that isn' t the half of it .
the scientists are forced to work night and day ... ... to make new versions of us !
invisible spies , an army of vampyric assassins .
m leaves for europe today with a sample case of the chemicals , to sell to the most eager nation .
i will not let m defeat the world .
do you think any of us feel differently ?
chimney pipes leads into the buildings .
bombs in the furnaces , would make quite a bang !
if someone needs to blow that place to hell , ... and i' m least likely to be seen .
skinner , if i didn' t know that you were such a barefaced liar ... ...
all that time pretending that you weren' t a hero ?
oh shut up or i' il come to my senses .
and besides , anymore like me , and i' il loose the franchise .
no !
this cannot be a hunt to death .
though it' s a pity .
we must take m alive .
if he' s secrets are to be uncovered .
not grey , he' s lived long enough !
oh , i' il handle him .
no !
nemo ?
you and hyde will free the prisoners .
sawyer and i will deal with m.
then the game is on .
do you mind ?
night , night .
the painting' s in your room .
in return for the league .
that was our deal , and i' m glad to see you honored it .
so what now ?
london !
i' ve had my full of violence .
now i' m in the mood for vice .
you could stay , share my dream .
i have lived long enough to see the future become history , professor .
empire' s crumble .
there are no exceptions .
you think you' re better than me .
you forget ...
i' ve seen your painting .
skinner said , turn right at the column .
oh great , which one ?
this way .
you lead .
i' il follow .
the scientists . they' re for nemo .
they' re movin ' out .
let' s hope skinner is up to the task .
release that !
get them back to the ship .
intruders .
intruders .
james , here is your box of tricks .
the brute' s potion .
the vampires blood , the indians science .
and mounted samples of invisible skin .
there' il be all the rage in europe .
the nautuhive is fueled and ready .
we have trouble .
trouble ?
i call it sport .
intruders .
indians .
i think it' s captain nemo and his men .
the prisoners are escaping !
how many times do i have to kill these ...
make this the last !
nemo , get the scientists !
is that all you got ?
do not move , m !
how would you prefer professor james moriarty ?
james moriarty .
the so called napoleon of crime .
that man died .
and i was reborn .
eyes open , boy .
i can' t protect you all the time .
hello lover .
mina ?
you' re alive ?
it' s possible .
i can' t die !
same could be said of you .
let' s put it to the test .
do you realize what you have done ?
what you' ve let out of me ?
a womans wrath , oh i' m petrified .
we' il be at this all day .
the bedroom mina .
does it give you memories ?
ideas ?
ideas !
if that had been permanent , i' d been very upset !
the painting .
i had to get to nale you one more time .
but didn' t think it would be literally .
it' s okay , it' s skinner .
what the hell are you doing here ?
what makes you think i' m skinner ?
sawyer , run for it .
keep moving .
go , go .
quickly .
come on .
you want more .
no !
not the whole thing .
you look so lovely .
thank you .
you broke my heart once .
this time you missed .
you spoke once of wanting to meet your demon ...
here ... he is !
skinner ?
it' s the last time i' il play with matches .
end of the line .
to the death , but you' il need hyde to make it mine .
he' il be making his own fight .
nemo !
here !
nemo !
nemo , run !
what is that thing ?
gives me a bad day !
he' s to strong .
we' re trapped !
no , he' s burning through the formula at an accelerated rate .
he' il soon change back .
i hope i' m more of a fighter when i' m your age .
you will not wanna live on today , that i promise you .
hyde , come on !
my formel is done .
do you think you' re gonna come in here and wreck all this ?
i' il just rebuild it !
there' il be others like me , quartermain .
you can' t kill the future .
do you ever get tired of being wrong ?
the league , me , skinner ?
wrong !
wrong about your little american friend as well .
do you really think he' s ready for action ?
i think you trained him as well as you trained your son .
get him !
it' s too far !
take your time .
you' re ready .
take your time .
i got him !
may this new century be yours , son .
as the old one was mine .
you remember he swore africa wouldn' t let him die ?
i wish the old boy had been right .
what' s next ?
i have long hidden away from the world , now i wish to see it anew as the century turns .
you' re all welcome to join me .
we' ve all been hiding in one form or another .
the nautilus awaits .
so who' s coming ?
so long , old chap .
goodbye alan .
goodbye .
