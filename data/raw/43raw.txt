what is it that makes a man a man ?
is it his origins , the way things start ?
or is it something else , something harder to describe ?
for me , it all began in 1944 .
classified mission off the coast of scotland .
the nazis were desperate .
combining science and black magic ... ... they intended to upset the balance of the war .
i was 28 , already a paranormal advisor to president roosevelt .
i could never have suspected that what would transpire that night ... ... would not only affect the course of history ... ... but change my life forever .
all right , men , let' s go .
move !
come on !
come on !
come on !
let' s fan it out .
your men ... ... they' il need these .
are you a catholic ?
yes .
among other things .
but that' s hardly the point .
well , you' re gonna need one of these .
i abhor the use of violence .
thank you .
i wouldn' t want you to think me mad , sergeant whitman .
no , three days too late for that , professor broom .

come on boys , let' s go !
this way !
left , right !
come on , men , let' s get the lead out !
we' re close !
you' re wasting our time .
there' s nothing here but sheep and rocks .
ruins , not rocks .
hold it right here !
the remains of trondham abbey , built on an intersection of ley lines ... ... the boundaries between our world and the others ...
what a load of crap !
hell , a week ago , i never even heard the word " parabnormal .
paranormal .
move it !
hold the line .
come on !
sweet jesus .
they must be here for the sheep .
the freak in the gas mask ...
karl ruprecht kroenen .
hitler' s top assassin and head of the thule occult society .
if he' s here , this is worse than i thought .
no matter what happens tonight ... ... this book will guide you back to me .
i will not leave you .
i grant you everlasting life ... ... youth ... ... and the power to serve me .
ilsa !
grigori !
it' s time .
five years of research and construction , grigori .
five years !
the fhrer doesn' t look kindly on failure .
there will be no failure , general .
i promised herr hitler a miracle .
i' il deliver one .
what i will do tonight can never be undone !
the seven gods of chaos !
our enemies will be destroyed !
and from the ashes ... ... a new eden will arise .
get down !
i was taking a picture .
you do that again and i' il carve you a new one .
listen , the portal is open .
do you understand ?
we have to stop them .
go !
go !
go !
go !
look out !
get down !
it' s almost over .
no , it' s not .
the portal' s been open for too long .
something may have come through .
have your men search the area thoroughly .
spread out over that way !
sir !
something up here !
he' s gone .
for now .
when you said something came through ...
from where ?
i don' t see them !
do you really , really believe in hell ?
there is a place , a dark place ... ... where ancient evil slumbers and waits to return .
grigori gave us a glance tonight .
grigori ?
that' s russian , right ?
grigori efimovich rasputin .
rasputin ?
come on !
occult adviser to the romanovs .
in 1916 , at a dinner in his honor ... ... he was poisoned , shot , stabbed , clubbed ... ... castrated and finally drowned .
and yet , we saw him here tonight .
professor broom .
careful .
be careful .
what the hell is that ?
an ape ?
no .
it was red .
bright red .
lower your light , you' re scaring it .
what are you two shooting at ?
a red ape !
no , it' s not an ape .
it' s got a big stone in its hand .
i think that is its hand .
look at the size of that whammer .
no , wait !
wait !
a blanket .
get me a blanket .
come on .
come on .
it' s safe .
jump down .
come on .
jump down .
it' s a boy .
it' s just a baby boy .
move to the left .
there we were , an unready father for an unwanted child .
the boys gave him a name that very night .
in retrospect , perhaps not the most fortunate .
but nevertheless , a name we all came to use .
we called him hellboy .
look at the birdie .
speculation about the origins ...
evidence that hellboy ...
so , what is it exactly that you say this agency does ?
i kid you not .
it hunts monsters .
the claim , of course , that this creature ... ... works for the fbi as a monster hunter .
what you seek is in there .
this is a sacred place .
give me my gold .
we shouldn' t be here .
master .
your eyes .
what did they do to your eyes ?
have you told him yet ?
no .
we should .
malignant sarcoma .
in the lungs ... ... the spine ... ... liver .
approximately ... ... how long ?
maybe six weeks .
i can arrange for hospitalization and pain management .
make the time more bearable .
no .
i' d rather be at home .
i have some arrangements to make .
for my son .
you can always get a second opinion .
that won' t be necessary .
hurry up !
hurry up !
wait right here !
tom manning is the head of special operations at the fbl .
he joins pat in the studio tonight to go over the latest hellboy sighting .
there .
that' s the tail .
and these are the horns .
i have a question .
in the pictures of aliens , ufo , the yeti , hellboy ... ... why is it they' re always out of focus ?
why don' t you tell us ... ... about the bureau of paranormal research and defense ?
i wanna tell you , i wanna tell the american public one thing .

sir , where am i , exactly ?
in the absence of light , darkness prevails .
there are things that go bump in the night , agent myers .
make no mistake about that .
and we are the ones who bump back .
1937 , hitler joins the thule society ... ... a group of german aristocrats obsessed with the occult .
1938 , he acquired the spear of longinus ... ... which pierced the side of christ .
he who holds it becomes invincible .
hitler' s power increases tenfold .
1943 , president roosevelt decides to fight back .
the bureau of paranormal research and defense is born .
1958 , the occult wars finally come to an end ... ... with the death of adolf hitler .

video surveillance shows a 16th century statue was destroyed .
st. dionysius the areopagite .
who wards off demons .
exactly .
the statue , however , was hollow .
a reliquary .
a prison .
the vatican deemed its occupant dangerous enough ... ... to include it on the list of avignon , of which , by the way , we hold a copy .
perfect job for these babies .

holy water , clove leaf , silver shavings , white oak .

salt gathered from the tears of a thousand angels .

professor .

the nanny squad .

damn !
could you please be a little careful ?
big baby .
how long was it latched onto you ?
i don' t know .
about five seconds .
professor , look .
is it bad ?
touched you five seconds , laid three eggs .
didn' t even buy me a drink .
the stinger detaches itself from the tongue and injects the eggs .
they are very sensitive to heat and light .
they need a humid , dark environment to breed .
did you ever lose track of him ?
well , let' s see .
there was that moment when i had the train on top of my head .
we can' t risk it .
tomorrow you' il go back to the tracks with a group of agents .
search the whole place top to bottom .
find those eggs and destroy them .
elizabeth sherman .
i don' t like the term " fire starter .
i just don' t .
and " pyrokinesis " sounds like some psychosis or something .
i don' t know .
maybe that' s right .
not being able to let go .
it' s scary .
i black out after each episode .
sometimes for hours .
you hear about so and so ... ... who just lost control and just exploded .
well , they' re lucky it isn' t true .
with me , it is .
my master is calling your name now , my girl .
you must return to the child .
so once again ... ... dream ... ... of fire .
hey , freak !

freak !
oh , no !

oh , no !
somebody !
help me !
help me , somebody !
help me !
how many buildings does she have to burn down ?
she belongs here .
that' s not what she feels .
she may never feel it .
it' s her choice .
professor , the girl you' re ...
professor , that girl you' re talking about ...
hey , boy scout ... ... think twice .
no , listen , i read her file .
" read her file . " she blames herself ... ... for that explosion in pittsburgh .
look , i think i can help .
i could talk to her .
i think i could bring her back .
just what was it that landed you this job pushing " pamcakes , " huh ?
what was it ?
punctuality ?
the way you part your hair ?
what is your area of expertise ?
he doesn' t want me with him .
i know that much .
you' re doing fine .
no , i' m not .
look , he respects clay , not me .
i' m really sorry , okay ?
i' m not your guy .
i' m dying , agent myers .
like any father , i worry about him .
in medieval stories , there is often a young knight ... ... who is inexperienced ... ... but pure of heart .
come on .
look , i am not pure of heart .
yes , you are .
rasputin is back for him .
what i ask of you ... ... is to have the courage to stand by him when i am gone .
he was born a demon .
can' t change that .
but you will help him ... ... in essence ... ... to become a man .
pull that down .
she was making great progress ... ... and now this .
we' il be closed for months .
and it put a big dent in our thorazine supply .
she' s been like this since it happened .
are you sure you want to go in ?
miss sherman ?
i' m agent myers , fbl .
miss sherman ?
can i call you liz ?
it' s a beautiful name .
sixty percent of all the women in the world are named liz .
well , it' s impressive by my standards .
my name' s john .
john t. myers .
dr. broom asked me to invite you back to the bureau .
no special precautions , no security escorts .
just you and me in a taxi like regular folks .
that doesn' t sound like him .
well , miss sherman , he' s asking you back ... ... but it' s entirely your choice , you know ?
choice , huh ?
that' s cute .
i' ve quit the bureau 13 times .
i always go back .
where else would i go ?
over here .
you said those eggs need it dark and humid ?
well , they hit the jackpot .
the subway lines , they all converge right around here .
right below us is the old vandeveer reservoir .
it was abandoned in the mid 30s .
there' s a pulse .
there .
a cistern on the other side .
most of the eggs are there .
there' s no way in .
we should go back and request a special permit , type 2 ...
you guys coming or what ?
we lead a charmed life .
here you are , doctor .
this should cover your tail fin .
reliquary .
straight from the vatican .
a bone from st. dionysius .
looks like a pinkie .
remind me why i keep doing this .
rotten eggs and the safety of mankind .
this doesn' t really look like doll' s hair .
be honest , red .
what do you think ?
i' m thinking about doing it myself .
hey , you guys find anything ?
no eggs yet , red .
what , are you on a lunch break ?
nothing here .
red' s on the move .
i' il cover him .
damn it , red .
hey , it' s abe .
oh , god .
