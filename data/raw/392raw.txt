i am on last feed now .

i' m almost done with the shut off valve .
sonny , i' m right behind you with the next fitting .
hang on a second .
ok , give it to me .
here you go .
thanks , sweetie .
all divers , drop what you' re doin ' .
everybody out of the pool .
i mean everybody right now .
sonny , one night , let' s go .
damn it .
we just got out here .
there was a time when i woulda asked why .
get a move on !
shit , woman !
deepcore , deepcore .
this is flatbed preparing to surface .
roger , flatbed .
come on up .
all rig personnel assemble at the moon pool .
everybody get to sub bay .
asap .
come on .
let' s get his hat off .
take it off .
what the hell' s goin ' on ?
how come we got recalled ?
the hell if i know .
i got it .
what' s the drift , pardner ?
why are we up ?
just follow standard procedure .
flog your dog till somebody tells you what' s happenin ' .
what' s the story , boss ?
folks , listen up !
we just been told to shut down the hole and prepare to move the rig .
oh , shit !
what ?
we' ve received an invitation to , um , cooperate in a matter of national security .
now you know as much as i do .
get your gear off and get to control .
we' ve got a briefing in ten minutes .
come on !
let' s move it !
at 0922 local time today an american nuclear submarine , the uss montana , with 156 men aboard , went down about 22 miles from here .
damn !
there' s been no contact with the sub since then .
the cause of the incident is not known .
your company has authorised the navy' s use of this facility for a rescue operation code named operation salvor .
you want us to search for the sub ?
no .
we know where it is .
but she' s in 2, 000 feet of water and we can' t reach her .
we need divers to enter the sub and search for survivors ... if any .
don' t you have your own stuff for this ?
by the time we get our submersibles here , the storm' il be on us .
you can get your rig in and be on site in 15 hours .
that makes you our best option .
why should we risk our butts for something like this ?
i have been authorised to offer you all special bonuses equivalent to three times normal dive pay .
yes , sir , buddy !
for triple time , i' d eat beany !
set me on fire and put me out with horse piss .
i don' t know what kind of deal you made with the company , but my people are not qualified for this .
we' re oil workers .
shut up !
hold it down .
this is lieutenant coffey .
he will transfer down to you with a seal team and supervise the operation .
send down whoever you like , but i' m the tool pusher on this rig .
when it comes to the safety of these people , there' s me and then god .
understand ?
if things get dicey ,
i' m pulling the plug .
i think we' re all on the same wavelength , brigman .
now , let' s get the wellhead uncoupled , shall we ?
let' s take it about five degrees left , all right ?
roger .
five degrees left , bud .
plot these numbers to our position .
i need to know when the leading edge will hit .
well , it' s official .
they' re calling it hurricane frederick .
and it' s gonna be making our lives
real interesting in a few hours .
fred ?
i don' t know , man .
i think hurricanes should be named after women , don' t you ?
i can' t believe you' re letting them do this .
hi , lins !
i thought you were in houston .
i was .
now i' m here .
only here isn' t where i left it , is it , bud ?
wasn' t up to me .
we were that close to proving a submersible drilling platform could work .
i can' t believe you let them grab my rig !
your rig ?
i designed the damn thing .
benthic petroleum paid for it .
so as long as they' re holding the pink slip , i go where they tell me .
i had a lot riding on this .
they bought you , didn' t they ?
more like rented you cheap !
i' m switchin ' off now .
bye bye .
oh , ok .
virgil , you wiener !
you never could stand up to a fight !
bye bye .
virgil ?
god , i hate that bitch !
probably shouldn' t have married her , then , huh ?
get it stable !
cab 3 .
you' re clear to launch .
hang on , gentlemen .
touchdown !
crowd goes wild !
explorer , this is cab 3 .
we are styling .
how you boys doin ' back there ?
great .
explorer , this is cab 3 .
starting our descent along the umbilical .
roger that , cab 3 .
good luck .
luck is not a factor .
hey , one night .
how you doin ' ?
i got a white line fever , baby .
yeah , i heard that .
deepcore , deepcore .
this is cab 3 on final approach .
roger , cab 3 .
is that you , lindsey ?
none other .
oh , no !
howdy , boys !
hey , lindsey !
i' il be damned !
y' all shouldn' t be down here , sweet thing .
you might ruin your stockings .
the bad news is we got eight hours in this can blowin ' down .
and the worse news is it' s gonna take us three weeks
to decompress later .
we' ve all been fully briefed , mrs brigman .
just don' t call me that , ok ?
i hate that .
all right .
what would you like us to call you ?
sir ?
there we go !
y' all start equalisin ' ... now !
let' s watch each other closely for signs of hpns .
high pressure nervous syndrome .
muscle tremors , usually in the hands first .
nausea , excitability ...
disorientation .
and a partridge in a pear tree .
about one person in 20 can' t handle it .
they just go buggo .
look , they' ve all made runs to this depth .
they checked out .
i understand that .
what i' m saying is it' s impossible to predict
just who' s susceptible .
they checked out .
these guys the seals ?
yeah .
those guys ain' t so tough .
i' ve fought guys plenty tougher than them .
now we get to hear how you could have been a contender ?
hey !
you see this ?
yeah .
they used to call this the hammer .
y' all done to a turn and ready to serve .
everybody ok ?
they' re really very sweet .
yeah .
hey !
i don' t remember putting a wall here .
how you doin ' , jammer ?
pretty good .
how are you , little lady ?
i' m ok .
i want a full check on their gear .
these guys are about as much fun as a tax audit .
hippy , you' re gonna give that rat a disease .
hi , lins !
well , well .
mrs brigman .
not for long .
you never did like being called that , did you ?
not even when it meant something .
is that one night in flatbed ?
yeah .
who else ?
here .
say hi .
hey , one night .
it' s lindsey .
oh , hi , lindsey .
obstacle avoidance is showin' a rise out about 100m .
what do you wanna do ?
i can' t believe you were dumb enough to come down here .
now you' re stuck here for the storm .
that was dumb , hot rod .
real dumb .
i didn' t come down here to fight with you .
yeah , well ...
then why did you come down ?
you need me .
nobody knows the systems on this rig better than i do .
once you' re disconnected , you guys are on your own for however long this storm lasts .
what if something was to happen after the surface support clears off ?
wow , you' re right .
us poor dumb old boys might' ve had to think for ourselves .
it could' ve been a disaster .
you wanna know what i think ?
jesus !
look where this thing is set .
you wanna know what i think ?
not particularly .
i think you were worried about me .
then that must be it .
no , seriously .
i think you were .
come on .
it' s ok .
it' s ok .
you can admit it .
i was worried ... about the rig .
i' ve got over four years invested in this project .
yeah .
you only had three years invested in me .
well , you have to have priorities .
it' s kinda messy , but i guarantee you it' s the only bunk that won' t be occupied .
you can get a couple of hours ' rest before we get there .
what are you still wearing that for ?
i don' t know .
divorce ain' t final .
forgot to take it off .
i haven' t worn mine in months .
yeah .
well , whatshisname wouldn' t like it .
the suit .
do you always have to call him that ?
the suit .
makes you sound like such a hick .
his name is michael .
how is michael , then ?
mr brooks brothers .
mr bmw .
you still seeing him ?
no .
no , i haven' t seen him in a few weeks .
terribly sorry .
what happened ?
why are you doing this ?
this is none of your business !
it' s not a part of your life any more .
i' il tell you what happened .
you woke up one morning in those satin sheets , rolled over , and there was this good looking guy .
well groomed , expensive watch on .
and you realised " this guy never makes me laugh .
that' s it , bud .
that' s it !
aren' t you clever ?
jesus !
you' re clever !
you should start your own talk show !
ask dr bud .
advice to the lovelorn from 300 fathoms .
thank you .
thank you .
oh , shit !
cuttin' you loose , bud .
ok , one night .
stay clear .
we' re setting her down .
touchdown !
this is us , sitting right on the edge of the cayman trough .
this is the montana .
300m away , 70m below us .
we think she slid down the wall and now sits here on this outcropping .
so we' re gonna have to drop straight down ... here and ...
this tell us how much radiation we' re gettin ' ?
whoa !
i' m not going near no radiation !
no way !
hippy , you pussy .
what good is the money , six months later your dick drops off ?
we' il take readings as we go .
if the reactor' s breached , the warheads have released any radioactive debris , we' il just back off .
it' s that simple .
ok .
ok .
hippy' s not going , so , mcwhirter , you can run little geek .
goddamn it !
you know mcwhirter can' t run an rov worth shit !
then you' d better go .
i' il go .
what is your problem ?
on this dive you' il do absolutely nothing without direct orders from me .
and you' il follow those orders without discussion .
is that clear ?
i want everyone ready to get wet in 15 minutes .
gimme a hand loading little geek .
let' s get suited up .
hey , guys !
hold it a second .
hold it !
whoa !
look ... ... it' s 3am .
these guys are running on bad coffee and about four hours of sleep .
maybe you could cut them some slack .
i can' t afford slack .
you come on my rig , you don' t talk to me , and you start ordering my people around .
it' s not gonna work .
you gotta know how to handle these people .
we got a certain way of doing things here .
i' m not interested in your way of doing things .
just get your team ready to dive .
these guys have got no sense of humour .
bud , do you know your hand is blue ?
finler , why don' t you just shut up and put your gear on ?
keep it coming .
hippy , throw me one of them cyalumes , please .
good .
excuse me .
what is all this stuff ?
fluid breathing system .
we just got them .
you use it when you go really deep .
how deep ?
deep .
how deep ?
it' s classified .
you breathe liquid so you can' t get compressed .
the pressure doesn' t get you .
you mean you got liquid in your lungs ?
oxygenated , fluorocarbon
emulsion .
bullshit !
check this out .
can i borrow your rat ?
what are you doin ' ?
you' re gonna ...
you' re gonna kill her !
it' s ok .
i' ve done this myself .
man !
you' re just drowning her ?
he' s gonna be fine .
i' ve breathed this myself .
it' s gonna be fine .
no , man .
she' s gonna drown !
she' s freaking out !
it' s a normal adjustment period .
does this look normal to you ?
she' s gonna drown !
he' s taking the fluid into his lungs .
he' s taking the fluid into his lungs .
there he goes .
still has a bit of anxiety here .
now he' s starting to relax .
he' s breathing fine .
see his chest moving ?
he' s getting plenty of oxygen .
damn rat' s breathing that shit .
that is , no bullshit , hands down , the goddamnedest thing i ever saw .
the fluid' s harder to push in and out than air .
it' s a little more work to breathe .
but he' s doing fine .
he' s diggin ' it .
she' s doin ' it .
she ain' t diggin ' it .
all right , let her out now !
now !
ok .
all right .
ok .
now we let the fluid drain from his lungs .
all right .
give her here .
give her here .
here' s your rat .
see ?
he' s fine !
it' s a she .
going over the wall .
coming to bearing 065 .
flatbed , you on line ?
ten four , lindsey .
we read you loud and clear .
starting our descent .
divers , how you doin ' ?
everybody' s ok so far .
hang on , boys .
it' s all downhill from here .
hey , how deep' s the drop off here ?
this here' s the bottomless pit , baby .
two and a half miles straight down .
cab 3 , it' s bud .
you on line ?
cab 3 check .
i' m right behind you .
cab 1 , do you see it yet ?
magnetometer' s twitching , but i don' t see anything yet .
hang on .
i' m gonna test my strobes .
cab 1 , do you have a visual ?
cab 1 , do you copy ?
yeah .
roger that .

cab 1 , radiation readings ?
neutron counter' s not showing much .
all right .
just continue forward along the hull .
copy that .
continuing forward .
you want me to get shots of everything , yes ?
roger that .
document as much as you can .
but , please , keep moving .
remember , we' re on a tight time line .
copy that .
coming up to the midships hatch .
do you see it , cab 3 ?
yeah , roger .
i got it .
how do you want me ?

all right .
i' m gonna open her up .
ok .
get in there .
roger .
somebody get on that tether .
got it .
sorry about this , little buddy , but better you than me .
you know what i mean ?
coffey , these are the missile hatches , right ?
that' s right .
it looks like a couple of the hatches have sprung .
radiation' s nominal .
warheads must still be intact .
how many are there ?
24 trident missiles .
eight mlrvs per missile .
that' s 192 warheads , coffey .
how powerful are they ?
your mlrvis a tactical nuke .
50 kilotons nominal yield .
say ... five times hiroshima .
jesus christ !
it' s world war ill in a can .
let' s knock off the chatter .
ok .
i' m headin ' into the reactor compartment .
getting a reading ?
it' s twitching .
but it' s below the line you said was safe .
all right .
let' s get in there .
flatbed , drop down starboard of the sail and stay along the cliff edge .
ok .
copy that .
keep heading for the bow .
ok , flatbed .
this looks good .
just set it down here .
we' re solid .
let' s go .
all right .
let' s go .

we knew we were gonna see this .
just move on .

let' s get moving .

i' ve gotta check out this compartment , all right ?
we' il stay in voice contact .
you hold onto the end of this rope here .
you have any problem whatsoever , you tug twice .
i got it .
pull it hard .
five more minutes .
just relax , all right ?
you' il be ok .
it' s ok .

we gotta be sure , right ?
hang on , jammer .

bud ?
can you hear me ?
bud ?
goddamn it !

lew !
cat !
hurry up , on the double !
i' m on my way !
jammer !

he' s convulsing !
it' s his mixture !
too much oxygen !
gotta get the o2 cut down !
turn him over !
crank it down , man !
you' re losing him !
all right .
we' ve gotta get him outta here !
let' s go .
let' s move it .
easy , big fella .
that' s it .
one night , do you see the divers ?
are they out yet ?
negative , lindsey .
haven' t seen hide nor hair .
let' s give ' em two minutes more max and then i' il sound the diver recall ...
lindsey , do you copy ?
meet me at flatbed !
this is a diver emergency !
lins , do you copy !
yeah , copy you , bud .
i' m on my way .
look , i' m just a medic .
which is mostly about patching holes .
this type of thing , it' s ...
there' s not much i can do .
the coma could last hours or days .
so you didn' t get anything on the cameras ?
no , i didn' t get a picture of it .
what about the video ?
no .
we lost power right then .
look , i just don' t wanna talk about this , ok ?
fine .
be that way .
look , i don' t know what i saw , bud , ok ?
coffey wants to call it a russian submersible fine .
it' s a russian submersible .
no problem .
yeah , but you think it was something else .
what ?
one of ours ?
no .
well , whose then ?
come on , lindsey .
talk to me .
look , jammer saw something down there .
something that scared the hell out of him .
his mixture got screwed up .
jammer panicked .
he pranged his regulator and his mixture got screwed up .
but what did he see that made him panic ?
well , what do you think he saw ?
i don' t know .
did any of you see it ?
no , sir .
the brigman woman saw it .
could have been a russian bogey .
clnclantflt' s gonna go apeshit .
two russian attack subs , a tango and a victor , were tracked to within 50 miles of here .
and now they don' t know where the hell they are .
ok .
i don' t have any choice .
i' m confirming you to go to phase two .
you' il recover one warhead , arm it , and wait for further instructions .
have we got a problem with that ?
negative , sir .
come on !
what' d he say ?
turn it up , bozo ! ... early reports that the montana encountered a soviet fast attack sub prior to its sinking and the kremlin continues to deny any involvement .
that' s us !
that' s us , man !
benthic petroleum are participating in the recovery operation , but we have little information .
we want names !
hey , that' s the explorer !
we' re famous !
there is a tremendous amount of activity .
with cuba only 80 miles away , the massive build up of american forces has drawn official protest from havana and moscow .
russian and cuban trawlers , undoubtedly surveillance vessels , have been circling the area
and soviet aircraft have been warned away .
this sucks !
hippy , what' s the matter with you ?
what' s the matter with me ?
nothing !
we' re in the middle of some international incident
like the cuban missile crisis !
figured that out for yourself , hip ?
we got russian subs creeping around .
anything goes wrong , they could say whatever they want happened .
relax , will you ?
you' re making the women nervous .
cute , virgil .
you know , those seals ain' t tellin ' us diddly .
something is goin ' on !
come on , come on .
hippy , you think everything' s a conspiracy .
everything is .
coffey' s splitting with flatbed !
i showed him how to work the controls and they' re outta here !
didn' t you tell him we need it ?
yeah !
where the hell is he takin ' it ?
i have no idea !
shit !
coffey !
come back !
we need the big arm to unhook the umbilical .
there' s a goddamn hurricane coming !
he switched off .
it' s unbelievable .
go back down and tell those men to get below and stay there !
we need to get unhooked and get out of here now !
all right .
do it , then .
no problem , except your boys went sightseeing with flatbed .
my people need flatbed to get unhooked at their end .
back in two hours .
two hours ? !
we' re gonna get the shit kicked out of us by our pal fred in two hours !
ok .
set cold tab fitting to 200psi .
set .
there she goes .
she' s breakin' loose .
bringin' her up .
ok .
all right .
clear the hatch .
go on with it .
go on .
that' s it .
up .
sir , the missile looks intact .
little is known about the events leading up to the collision .
the us navy guided missile cruiser appleton apparently struck the soviet udaloy class destroyer in low visibility conditions .
in violent seas , little hope remains for over 100 russian crewmen , still missing after the sinking an hour ago .
soviet military spokesmen have claimed that the collision constituted an unprovoked attack .
this was denied by ...
bud , this is big time . ... who said that captain michael sweeney ...
ok .
it' s clear .
it' s all yours , sir .
i' m gonna swing it away and drop it .

i was under orders .
i had no choice .
how' s it going , cat ?
what' s the scoop , ace ?
well ,
i can get power to this module and sub bay if i reroute these buses .
but i gotta get past the mains , which are a total meltdown .
but there won' t be enough to run the heaters .
in a few hours , this place is gonna be as cold as a meat locker .
what about o2 ?
yeah , well , brace yourself .
if we close off the sections we' re not using , we have about maybe 12 hours ' worth .
the storm' s gonna last a lot longer than 12 hours .
yeah , well ...
i can maybe extend that .
maybe .
there are some storage tanks outboard next to the wrecked module .
i' il have to go outside , though , and tie onto them .
hey , lins .
lins .
yeah ?
i' m glad you' re here .

i' m not .
hey .

jeez !
that' s perry .
that' s it , then .
finler , mcwhirter , dietz and perry .
jesus .
we just leave ' em there ?
yeah , for now .
we got no choice .
our first priority is to get somethin ' to breathe .
where are you now , lins ?
i' m under the starboard tri module .
still with me , hip ?
right behind you , lins .
how' s it look ?
well , you guys really screwed up my rig .
there' s a lot of wreckage out here .
well , don' t get fouled .
hit me with that nine sixteenths , ok ?
yeah .
thank you .
so ...
there you were .
yeah , there we were .
side by side on the same ship for two months .
i' m a tool pusher and we' re testing this automated derrick of hers .
we get back on the beach and we' re livin ' together .
doesn' t mean you had to marry her .
well , we were due to go back out on the same ship .
six months of tests .
if you were married , you got a stateroom .
otherwise it was bunks .
ok .
good reason .
will you come over here and tighten this for me ?
then what ?
then it was all right there for a while , you know .
then she got promoted to chief engineer on this thing .
she went front office on you , man .
yeah , well , you know lindsey .
she' s just too damn aggressive .
son of a bitch !
she didn' t leave me .
she just left me behind .
bud , let me tell you somethin ' .
she ain' t half as smart as she thinks she is .
get outta here .
come on .
let' s see those muscles .
bingo !
that' s one .
two for two .
hey , hey .
lindsey , do you read me ?
over .
copy you , hippy .
what' s the matter ?
oh , shit .
the power' s jackin ' around with us again .
lindsey , come back .
i just lost video .
lins , are you there ... ?
hippy , do you copy ?
lins , you copy ?
oh , shit !
oh , what the hell !
hippy , do you copy ?
damn it !
bud , do you copy ?
over .
i seem to be having a problem here .
shit !
damn it !
that' s a great shot , lins .
you drop your dive light ?
come on , you guys .
that' s the smaller one .
that' s the smaller one here .
you can see how it' s zigging around .
whatever it is .
i' m telling you what it is .
you' re just not hearing me .
now , lindsey ...
there is something down there .
something not us .
you could be more ... specific .
something that zigs .
not us .
not human .
get it ?
something non human but intelligent .
a non terrestrial intelligence .
a non terrestrial intelligence .
ntls .
oh , man , that' s better than ufos .
but that works too .
underwater flying objects .
are we talking little space friends here ?
hell , yeah !
hot rods of the gods !
right , lins ?
no , no , really .
it could be ntls .
the cla has known about ' em for ever .
step outside .
they abduct people all the time , man .
hippy , would you do me a favour ?
stay off my side .
will you step into my office , please ?
certainly .
i ...
come here .
jesus , lins !
something really important' s happening .
i' m trying to keep the situation under control .
i can' t allow this kind of hysteria .
who' s hysterical ? !
nobody' s hysterical !
when you' re hanging on by your fingernails , you don' t go waving your arms around .
i saw something .
i' m not gonna go in there and say i didn' t see it when i did .
i' m sorry .
please .
you are the most stubborn woman i know .
yes , i am !
but i need you to believe me right now .
now , come on .
look at me .
come on .
am i stressed out ?
do i have any symptoms of pressure sickness , tremors , slurred speech ?
no .
no .
bud , this is me lindsey .
ok ?
you know me better than anybody in the world .
now watch my lips .
i saw these things .
i touched one of them .
and ... it wasn' t some clunky steel can ... ... like we would build .
it glided .
it was the most beautiful thing i' ve ever seen .
oh , god , i wish you' d been there .
it was a machine .
it was a machine , but it was alive .
it was like a ... like a dance of light .
please .
you have to trust me .
now , i don' t think they mean us any harm .
i don' t know how i know that .
it' s just ... a feeling .
jesus !
i' m supposed to go on a feeling ?
how can i go on a feeling ?
you think coffey' s gonna go on a feeling ?
well , we all see what we wanna see .
coffey looks and he sees russians .
he sees hate and fear .
you have to look with better eyes than that .
please .
i can' t , lins .
i' m sorry .
all i want is 24 hour surveillance on exterior cameras .
you' ve got six people .
i' ve got ...
comin ' through !
everybody just stop !
all right .
i want around the clock manning of the sonar shack and the exterior cameras .
that russian bogey comes back ,
i don' t think we should be taking a nap .
give me a break , coffey .
those things live three and a half miles down in an abyssal trench .
trust me , they' re not speaking russian .
have you finished the repairs
on the acoustical transmitter yet ?
nope .
why not ?
i was having my nails done .
well , get it done .
kiss my ass .
all right .
get something straight .
you people are under my authority .
look , pardner ... we don' t work for you .
we don' t take orders from you .
and we don' t much like you .
hey , cat !
yeah .
why don' t you take the first watch on sonar ?
ok ?
right on .
sonny , you get a couple of hours ' sleep .
then you spell cat , all right ?
hippy , you handle exterior surveillance .
one night ...
will you do me a favour and see if you can get that transmitter fixed ?
all right ?
give me a couple of hours .
got it .
all right .
come on , aj squared away .
a little to the left .
what is ... ?
oh , this is not happening .
i' m shaking , man .
all right .
wait .
and now ...
here' s mlrv !
oh , come on , man !
what else could it be ?
why bring it here ?
it' s gotta be some kind of emergency plan to keep it away from the russians , right ?
look , they hot wire one of the nukes .
they use some kind of detonator that they brought .
then they stick it back in the sub .
fry the whole thing up .
bam !
slicker than snot .
i' m tellin ' you .
and i' m not being paranoi ...
hi , lins .
lins , will you just wait a second ?
if you don' t do something about it , i will !
lindsey , we' il do something about it !
fellas ? !
hello !
lins !
stop and think about this for a second .
what ?
you know , you' ve got some huevos bringing that thing into my rig .
with all that' s goin ' on up in the world , you bring a nuclear weapon
in here !
mrs brigman ...
does this strike anyone as particularly psychotic , or is itjust me ?
mrs brigman , you don' t need to know the details of our operation .
it' s better if you don' t .
you' re right !
i don' t need to know !
what i need to know is that thing is off this rig !
do you hear me , roger ramjet ? !
you' re becoming a serious impediment to our mission .
now , you either do an about face and walk out of here , or i' il have you escorted out .
i will not do an about face and get outta here !
who the hell do you think you' re talking to ?
emergency !
maintenance room b !
move it !
on the double !
now !
in here !
come on !
we got trouble !
come on !
what' s goin ' on ?
all right !
what' s up ?
what' s happening ?
you let her go , man .
do it .
do it now !
let her go .
the smartest thing you ever did .
coffey , you son of a bitch !
lindsey !
cool it .
what' s the problem ?
nothing .
we were just leaving .
weren' t we ?
we don' t need them .
we can' t trust them .
we may have to take steps .
we' re gonna have to take steps .
lins , i want you to stay away from that guy .
i mean it .
the guy is gone .
did you see his hands ?
what ?
he' s got the shakes ?
look , he' s operating on his own .
he' s cut off from his chain of command .
he' s showing signs of pressure induced psychosis .
and he' s got a nuclear weapon .
so , as a personal favour to me , will you try to put your tongue in neutral for a while ?
i gotta tell you .
i give this whole thing a sphincter factor of about 9 . 5 .
you can just punch into his primary guidance chip where you want him to go
and he' il go there , right ?
no .
bad idea , lindsey .
why , hip ?
come on .
because even if it could take the pressure at that depth , which i don' t think it can , without the tether , you know what would happen ?
it would just sit like a dumb shit .
something would have to pass in front of the camera for you to see anything .
but we could get lucky .
so we should go for it .
i really ought to talk to bud about this .
no .
this is between you and me .
we get proof and then we tell the others .
hippy , look .
if we can prove to coffey that there aren' t russians down there , maybe he' il ease off the button a little bit .
i gotta tell you , that guy scares me more than anything we' re gonna find down there .
he' s a goddamn aj squared away jarhead robot !
give me a couple of hours .
i' il see what i can do .
great .
thanks .
how' s that ?
thanks .
virgil , turn on your side .
all right .
you' re all set , big guy .
hey , i told you to wipe that grin off your face .
good night , little buddy .
bud !
get up !
cat ?
cat !
hey !
goddamn ...
leave me alone .
bud !
no , wait .
it' s ok .
sweet christ almighty !
i think it likes you .
it' s trying to communicate .
it' s bud .
it' s wonderful !
it' s me !
no .
don' t ...
it' s ok .
is it alive ?
lindsey , no ...
seawater .
oh , man .
come on !
hurry !
where the hell' s it going ?
hurry !
i think it' s headed for b module !
lins , you see it ?
so , raise your hand if you think it was a russian water tentacle .
lieutenant ?
no ?
well ...
a breakthrough .
hey , ace ,
you done impressing yourself ?
no way that thing could just be seawater .
they must have learned to control water .
i mean , at a molecular level .
they can plasticise it , pulverise it , do whatever they wanna do with it .
they can put it under intelligent control .
maybe ... their whole technology is based on that controlling water .
was it the same thing that you saw the last time ?
no .
you know , i don' t think that that thing you saw was one of them .
what are you talkin ' about ?
i mean , i don' t think it was an ntl .
i think it was like their version of an rov .
like big geek .
hippy , you mean they was just checkin ' us out ?
yeah .
how come ?
curious , i suppose .
we' re probably the first people they' ve ever seen .
it went straight for the warhead .
and they think it' s cute !
you need to get some sleep .
we have no ... ... way of warning the surface .
and you know what that means ?
it means whatever happens ... ... is up to us .
us .
so you think they' re from down there originally ?
or from ... ... you know .
i don' t know .
i think ...
i think they' re from " you know " .
someplace with similar conditions .
cold , intense pressure .
oh , man !
happy as hogs in a waller down there , probably .
sniff something ?
did you , rat boy ?
hey !
freeze !
don' t move !
that' s right .
ok , hip ?
they' re using big geek
to take the bomb to the ntls .
what ?
we set it up to go right to ' em .
oh , my god !
take this .
we' re going to phase three .
what ?
we don' t have orders for that !
i programmed big geek to go down to the bottom of the trench and shoot some video .
now they got the warhead tied to it .
coffey .
coffey ...
come on , coffey .
just think about what you' re doing , ok ?
just think about what you' re doing !
get back !
this is something i' ve wanted to do since we first met .
take it easy .
all right !
into the kitchen !
let' s go !
move !
get your damn hands off of me !
i know the way .
your boss is fixin ' to pull the pin on 50 kilotons .
and we' re all gonna be ringside !
he' s havin ' a full on meltdown !
what' s the timer set for ?
three hours .
shut up !
don' t talk .
three hours .
we can' t get to minimum safe distance in three hours .
we can' t go to phase three .
what about these people ?
shut up !
what' s the matter with you ?
everybody just stay calm .
the situation is under control .
anybody touches that door , kill ' em .
shoenick !
your lieutenant' s about to make a real bad career move !
the guy is crazier than a shithouse rat !
can' t you see he' s lost it ?
shut up !
the shock wave' il kill us .
quiet !
it' il crush this rig like a beer can .
shut up , man !
we gotta stop him .
shut up !
this is not our mission .
we can' t detonate without orders .
he' s about to declare war on an alien species just when they' re trying to make contact with us .
please !
i don' t know .
i think i' m reaching him .
yeah !
i' il be damned .
jammer .
is everybody ok ?
oh , man !
don' t move , jarface !
look , i' m the least of your problems .
take it easy , hippy .
how you feeling , big guy ?
i' m ok , bud .
i ...
i just ... figured i was dead back there when i saw that angel coming for me .
yeah , ok .
yeah .
why don' t you tell us about it later ?
come on .
he' s got it tied off with something .
come on .
ready ?
we' re not gonna be able to budge it .
now what ?
this is the only door to sub bay .
what are you doing ?
i' m gonna swim to hatch six .
what ? !
i' m gonna get inside
and open the door from the other side .
bud , this water is freezing .
then i guess you' d better wish me luck , huh ?
wish us luck .
you comin ' along ?
looks that way .

come on , bud .
in case i don' t die ...

come on , bud .
let' s go , pardner .
i ain' t got all day .

it' s the only way .
i can' t .
i can' t make it , pardner .
i' m sorry .
ok , cat .
you head on back , all right ?
what is he doing ?
he can' t make it to the door .
he' s gonna try and take him out himself .
no .
god , he couldn' t be that dumb .
that guy' s a trained killer .
no !
coffey ...
coffey , listen .
hey !
hey !
bud , you all right ?
get him , cat !
he' s dogged it , bud !
we gotta get this off of here .
come on .
help me .
pull the gripper !
cat , get the door !
shit !
come on !
shoot !
you all right ?
the safety' s on !
give me that !
come on !
let' s go !
help me out !
gimme a hand .
let' s move it .

why don' t you swim back to the rig and bring back another suit ?
that' il take me about seven or eight minutes to swim , get the gear , and come back .
i wouldn' t make it .

ok .
let' s look around .
let' s look .
oh , my god !

it' s hard for me , you know .
it' s not easy being a cast iron bitch .
it takes discipline and years of training .
a lot of people don' t appreciate that .
jesus , i' m sorry i can' t tell you these things to your face .
i have to wait till you' re alone in the dark , freezing , and there' s 10, 000 feet of water between us .
i' m sorry .
i' m rambling .

12, 000 feet .
jesus !

alone in all that ... cold ... blackness .
but i' m there in the dark with you .
oh , bud .
you' re not alone .
oh , god !
you remember that time ...
you were pretty drunk .
you probably don' t remember .
the power went out in that little apartment we had on orange street .
we were staring at that one little candle and i said something really dumb like ... ... " that candle is me , like ...
like every one of us is out there alone in the dark in this life .
and you just ... you just lit up another candle and you put it beside mine , and you said " no .
see , that' s me .
that' s me .
and we stared at the two candles and then ...
well , if you remember any of this , i' m sure you remember the next part .
but there are two candles in the dark .
i' m with you .
i' il always be with you , bud .
i promise that .
how you doin ' , pardner ?

come back .
you talk to us , buddy boy .

i need to know if you' re ok .
you ... you see light ?
what kind of light , bud ?
he' s hallucinating badly .
he made it .
oh , my god .
ok , bud .
we' il go step by step .
remove the detonator housing by unscrewing it counterclockwise .
all right , bud .
you have to cut the ground wire .
not the lead wire .
it' s the blue wire with the white stripe .
not , i repeat , not the black wire with the yellow stripe .
quiet !
save your air .
bud , give me a reading off your liquid oxygen gauge .
what ?
it took him 30 minutes to get there !
bud !
do you hear me ?
you drop your weights and start back now !
that gauge could be wrong .
do you hear me ?
just drop your weights and start back now !
your gauge could be wrong !
your gauge could be wrong !
you drop your weights and start back now !
you won' t stay there .
you drop your weights .
you can breathe shallow !

you dragged me back from that bottomless pit !
you can' t leave me here alone now .
please !
oh , god , virgil !
please !
please !
i love you .
howdy .
how are you guys doin ' ?
attempts to convene a summit between heads of state have collapsed ...
the soviet build up of tanks and aircraft has ...
all citizens to stay on their jobs , restrict unnecessary travel ... ... what officials are calling an unprovoked attack .
oh , shit !
across the country , national guard units have been mobilised and all civil defence volunteers have been called to full time duty .
you watch our tv .
that' s what you' re telling me .
you know what' s going on up there .
seismologists are reporting an enormous disturbance throughout the world' s oceans which apparently began about 15 minutes ago .
they are acoustic shock waves like tsunamis , but with no apparent seismological source .
the waves are propagating towards the shorelines of every continent .
i' m sorry .
that' s ...
dr berg , would you please ...
young lady .
young lady , listen to me .
i don' t know .
we don' t know what' s going on yet .
we don' t have a clue .
the horizon has already grown dark .
people are running everywhere .
it' s sheer panic .
stay on me !
the wave ... the wave is , i don' t know , maybe 1, 000 feet high already .
getting bigger as i' m watching , still miles out .
my god !
get outta here !
no !
stay !
we' re staying !
give it to me , then !
i don' t even know if i' m still broadcasting .
i can' t be sure .
i' il just keep going as long as i can .
you guys are doing this .
you guys are doing this , right ?
you can control water .
that' s your technology , but why are you doing this ?

how do you know they' re really gonna do it ?
where do you get off passing judgement on us ?
you can' t be sure .

we' ve lost seven people , including bud .
and we' re about out of o2 , so whatever you' re gonna do ...
you make up your mind how to get us outta here ?
they' re talking about flying in a dsrv from norfolk .
i just wish i could' ve seen it .

how do you stop a half mile high tidal wave ...
hey ...

it says " virgil brigman back on the air .

guess they' ve been here a while .
they' ve left us alone , but it bothers them to see us hurting each other .
getting out of hand .
they sent a message .
hope you got it .
i' d say that' s a big ten four , jack .
they want us to grow up a bit and put away childish things .
of course , it' s just a suggestion .
looks like you boys might be out of business .
what the hell' s goin ' on ?
one night , get to sonar .
good god almighty !
fellas ...
i' m gettin ' some awful big readings here .
something' s comin ' up the wall !
