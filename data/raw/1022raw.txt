hey , maggie .
hey , ryan .
hey , what' d you do last night ?
you know , the usual had the driver take me shopping , hit up some clubs .
then wound up at some after hours talking fashion with the beastie boys .
you ?
picked up ashley grant in the ferrari , had dinner at one of my restaurants .
reluctantly made an appearance at some vlp awards show party .
you know , same old thing .
right .
watched tv and made a mix tape .
played the accordion .
thanks , dad .
i' m only saying this because we' re friends ... but you really need to get over this ashley grant thing .
because ?
because you' ve been into her forever ... and it' s just not healthy .
you' re like obsessed .
so ?
so , every guy in school likes her .
you' d get crushed .
here comes the steamroller now .
hi , ashley .
are you okay ?
ashley grant wants me , man .
hey , floyd .
you know , i' m gonna miss this place .
i' m gonna miss this place the games , the parties , all these lovely women diggin ' me .
more like all but one of ' em .
maggie carter ... breaks my heart .
i still got four weeks .
how many times are you gonna ask her out ?
and be completely shut down .
but this time i got a plan .
sorry about ... your mouth .
well , that' s the first complaint i' ve had about it so far .
" sorry about your mouth " ?
what the hell is wrong with me ?
you suck with women , especially fine ones like ashley grant .
way to go , champ .
thanks .
relax , ryan .
it could be worse .
oh , really ?
speaking of .
your mom' s on stage in her nurse' s outfit .
hi , mrs. woodman .
attention , everyone .
could you please take your seat ?
everybody find your seats .
quickly , please .
we have a very exciting lecture today , and i' m sure you won' t wanna miss it .
watch this .
he' s gonna get dissed .
excuse me .
oh , you gotta pay the toll .
you want me to kick you in the face ?
that depends .
would you be naked ?
school' s almost out and you' re still saying no to me .
say it isn' t so .
no , really , man .
the master has lost his touch .
hello , everyone .
i' m katie woodman , school nurse .
and since summer' s approaching , i thought i' d talk to you ... a little bit about safe sex .
as you know , the safest route is abstinence .
but if you' re going to be sexually active ... there' s a few things that you need to know , okay ?
speaking of " wood man .
hot from mama' s personal collection ?
shut up .
for those of you who may not know , this is the penis .
come to my house after school .
you want to ?
i' m having some friends over .
it' il be fun .
i can' t .
i got plans .
and that means that this goes hand in hand with ... the latex condom .
for it to be effective ...
oh , man ! it needs to be pulled down all the way .
god , that was like a bad dream .
well , every man needs a dream .
and mine is to become the next virgil doolittle .
you know what he got expelled for ?
he stole gilmore' s neck .
that' s right .
cooper gilmore has no neck all because of virgil doolittle .
he got arrested .
and was charged with mayhem .
how cool is that ?
the man' s a legend .
the man went to prison .
allegedly .
and besides , who cares ?
it' s been 21 years and doolittle lives on .
a recent survey showed that most women do prefer a man of danger .
what' s up , cosmo ?
how' s it going ?
cool .
what' s up ?
do you think accordion players have groupies ?
i mean , really good ones ?
why do you ask ?
it' s three weeks to prom .
that' s right .
i don' t know .
i think it might be kind of nice to go .
i figured , who better to go with than my lifelong neighbor ... best buddy and partner in crime ?
no prospects ?
have you seen me with any lately ?
are you gonna make me beg ?
yeah , maybe a little .
i guess you' il have to go stag with floyd and the boys .

quasimodo and the notre dame chick .
tommy lee and  everybody .
yeah .
of course , he' s somewhat gifted .
studies show 84 % of all women polled prefer technique to physical size .
don' t tell me you can' t grasp the greatness of this ?
you compared me to the hunchback .
next to ashley grant , you kind of are .
i' d like to hunch her back .
ashley' s gonna love this .
i can' t send her that .
you just did .
she' s gonna hate me , man .
exactly .
i sent maggie poetry from you .
listen .
every guy in school wants to say something nice to ashley grant .
big deal .
you gotta stand out .
be different .
yeah , but , " your hair looks butch " ?
it' il work .
ryan , your mom' s heading this way .

i had to kill a man .

that' s okay .
why not ?
he' s gotta take a shit .
you see , ashley , i had to i don' t know them .
what' s he all dressed up for ?
his mom died .
earlier today .
ladies , sit tight .
so , she says , " true or false ?
and i said , " hello .
news flash .
if you have to ask , false .
she' s such a liar .
so the liar .
then she said , " i can' t believe you' re acting like this .
and i said , " i can' t believe you' re dressing like this .
marnie , is that my dress ?
she knows you' re here .
she wants to talk .
it' s all good .
i' m on this .
sloane got drunk and made out with that hairy guy .
you' re lying !
you know you made out with him .
whatever , marnie .
did you get my e mail ?
oh , my god .
was that you ?
did you get my words ?
poetry .
i didn' t know you had it in you .
a little surprise .
you liked it ?
pretty freaky stuff .

oh , man .
that was whack .
jesus !
hey , chris .
thanks for your help .
yeah , like carter really liked your crap .
see what just happened ?
people saw that .
damn , man , you' re too cocky .
what ?
i saw you groping her .
it doesn' t matter what i write .
maggie' s not gonna go for that .
she volunteers at a nursing home , for god' s sake .
why ?
that' s what i' m talking about .
grant isn' t exactly all hot for you either .
see , that' s great .
the idea was " ryan impresses ashley .
not " ryan depresses ashley .
ryan gets pickle in ashley .
not , ashley gets ryan in a pickle .
look , man , chicks dig assholes , okay ?
i mean , check out stu and harris .
they' re both gonna get laid tonight .
i' il show you .
let' s find ashley .
get away !
you know you like it .
remember in grade school when you always picked on the girl you liked ?
it' s kind of like that .
some girls are just insecure .
you' re saying ashley grant is insecure .
she' s the head cheerleader of insecurity .
and if i treat her bad , she' il go for it ?
absolutely .
come on .
that doesn' t make any sense .
what , you' ve dated how many of these girls ?
that' s what i thought .
now check out grant .
do you want her or not ?
well , yeah , but  okay .
there you go .
now you' re in the game .
you asshole !
i got something for ya !
forget it .
i' m out of here .
how could you have done this ?
this was cashmere !
how could you do that ?
' cause i' m an asshole ?
move , jerk !
asshole !
what are you doin ' , man ?
those chicks were diggin ' us .
it' s him .
wanna see the rest of the house ?
this isn' t working .
sure it is .
grant asked me about 20 times if the e mail guy was right about her hair ?
even if everything you said is true , i don' t want to be mean to her .
right .
seeing as how she' s so sweet to you .
listen .
you know what ashley said to me tonight ?
she' s looking for something special .
i can get you there .
you can be that guy for her .
you just have to help me be that guy for maggie .
i thought i was being abducted .
how come you bagged on the party ?
i had better things to do .
like sleep .
you should try it .
i talked to chris campbell .
i bet that was educational .
actually , it was .
he' s not that bad , once you get past the jock stuff .
he asked about you .
yeah , i got some goofy e mail from him .
you didn' t like it ?
i mean , did you write him back ?
be serious .
why not ?
you haven' t been on a date in like forever .
you think i enjoy asking you to prom ?
hanging out with the guys every weekend ?
i thought you liked hanging with us ?
yeah , some weekends .
okay ?
some .
then e mail him .
why not send him the famous " maggie carter soul quiz " ?
right .
that' d be good for a laugh .
maybe .
but maybe he' il ace it .
then you won' t have to spend another miserable weekend with me .
you know what i meant .
yeah , i know .
good morning .
what' s up ?
you guys get dressed in the dark ?
it' s mismatch day .
so maybe i should go home and change .
you and ashley grant , i think that' s your mismatch , buddy .
opposites do attract .
thanks , cosmo .
probably not that opposite .
carter sent me like this midterm , you know , like questions .
i know .
it' s a soul quiz movies , books , music .
if you can pass it , you' re a new man .
famous .
there is one small hitch .
you do realize ashley grant hates me .
clear the pool .
man , she doesn' t hate you .
she' s confused by you .
she' s trying to act like she doesn' t care .
but believe me , brian , she cares more than you think .
she just can' t figure you out .
it' s driving her nuts .
you' re this new guy " brian " who' s not into her for some reason .
but i' m not brian .
hey , brian .
there they are !
step off .
what a doofus .
you girls are hot .
what' s up , dudes ?
who' s the gerbil ?
i' m floyd .
ryan' s friend .
the chicks want me .
you got a soul quiz to take .
do you wanna see what i' m writing ?
no , man .
just make me look good .
not too cocky .
is everything okay ?
the last book he read was nine stories .
salinger .
wow .
it gets worse .
the beastie boys , the eels and old cheap trick .
he aced it .
movies ?
stripes , casablanca and anything by monty python .
that' s great .
no , it' s not .
it' s horrible .
chris campbell .
maggie , it' s not that bad .
not that bad .
man , he' s gorgeous .
what am i gonna do ?
you mean after tonight' s double date ?
not a chance .
why not ?
because as far as i can see ... there is nothing special about this person .
that' s what he said about you .
he did not .
i' m serious .
he said those things .
he really likes you , okay ?
it' s just one date .
trust me .
trust me .
i' m really a man .
when a chick goes on a talk show ... with her fianc and has a deep , dark secret ... has it ever been anything other than , " i' m really a man " ?
i mean , seriously .
your fianc invites you on tv to tell you something , she' s packin ' sausage .
i gotta get ready .
i know .
listen .
that' s why i' m calling .
be careful tonight .
pat her down before you get in the car .
just be sure .
hold on .
i got another call .
so what ?
let it go .
it might be chris .
inbreed !
i' m sorry .
i can' t do this .
i' m calling chris .
what ?
maggie , you have to .
it just doesn' t feel right .
what doesn' t feel right ?
he passed the soul quiz .
maggie , i need your help .
no , you don' t .
you' re gonna be fine .
sorry .
what kind of mongrel leaves a guy on call waiting ?
i can' t .
i gotta go .
cosmo says to check for an adam' s apple , all right ?
talk .
hey , chris ?
that' s me .
hey , it' s maggie .
listen .
i' m calling you about tonight .
you hold on one second ?
yeah .
talk .
maggie' s gonna call .
don' t answer .
i already did .
shit !
she wants to cancel the date .
yeah , the soul quiz ?
she liked all that stuff .
i don' t know what happened .
maybe she' s nervous .
nervous stomach ?
yeah .
probably the pill .
put me on hold and i' il try to talk you through this .
but you gotta keep coming back to me .
now let' s start with , " i was really looking forward to seeing you tonight .
we seem to have a lot in common .
yadda , yadda .
no , i don' t think , " bitch , we had plans " will work .
hold on .
sorry about the wait .
it' s cool .
great .
that' s my other line .
can you hold on a second ?
what happened ?
your mom fell down the stairs !

chris , can i call you back ?

i just bought us a few seconds .
dude , let it go .
she' s not going .
she' s is going .

you' re depressed .
your grades suck .
your father' s on crack .
my dad played pro football .

i don' t know what your problem is .
she' s back .
don' t screw this up .
hold on .
sorry .
hello ?
chris , are you there ?
yeah , i' m here ... baby .
are you okay ?
' cause you sound kind of different .
yeah , well
yeah , see , the batteries are runnin ' low on my wireless .
i have to put you on speaker .
can you hang on ?
just a second .
sorry about that .
can you hear me now ?
yeah , sort of .
listen .
i hope you' re not sick .
well , you know , i' m sick about this not happening .
i mean ...
i know i' m a jock .
i' m brainless ... conceited , in love with myself .
or that' s how you must see me .
but let me tell you how i see you .
the you i see ... has a big heart .
she' s smart , fun to hang around with ... doesn' t take my shit .
and i like that .
i like that you look nervous sometimes for no reason .
and when you do , you bite your lip .
i like that you probably ... rifled through your closet tonight ... and settled with what you started out with .
i like your smile .
you know ...
i don' t usually talk this way , but ...
i think being with you ... wouldn' t be irrelevant .
you know what i' m saying ?
or maybe i should stop with all this weak shit .
no , it' s nice .
oh .
all right .
so let' s do this , huh ?
you know , no pressure .
we' il go hang out , the four of us .
get to know each other .

tell her her breath is rank .
i' m not tellin ' her that .
whatever , man .
i' m tellin ' carter she needs a titjob .
i' m just pullin ' your dick .
what do you want me to say ?
why don' t you just be the strong silent type ?
if you decide to talk to her , be nice , all right ?
tell her she looks nice .
tell her you like her outfit .
okay .
and you should probably tell grant her ass looks big in those jeans .
you look nice .
i like your clothes .
thanks .

oh , my god .
there' s the octopus .
come on , marge .
there' s no line .

you have really amazing eyes , really pretty ... wandering
besides , compared to your jeans , your hair' s a work of art .
so , it' s really great that you like the eels .
other than ryan , i really don' t know anyone else who likes ' em .
the eels .

i' m sorry .
i loved the cake .

the old nail and bail ?

i saw grant this morning blubbering like a whale .
so ?
so you didn' t try to sleep with her ?
it wasn' t like that .
you see , it is like that .
no , it isn' t , because you never cared about maggie .
neither did you .
i cared about her .
don' t look so surprised , partner .
nail and bail' s crushed far greater chicks than carter .
there is not a chance in hell maggie sleeps with you .
she' s better than that !
maybe she used to be , but then you stepped in and changed all that .
didn' t you , brian ?
it is " ryan . " it' s not " brian .
doesn' t really matter , does it ?
get in that box now , sue ann !

someone trying on some pants ?

you can be pissed at me if you want to .
that' s fine .
i deserve it .
just tell me if you' ve seen her .
not since you scared her off bird dogging for sniff .
what is this , some ladies ' afternoon tea ?
walk it off .
what are you guys doing at my house ?
what happened between you and ashley ?
is there someone else ?
was it the hair on her back ?
' cause she is getting that removed .

isn' t there anything that she can do ?
look , short of camping on my lawn and begging profusely , no .
i cut out today and bought it .
for prom .
what do you think ?
i think it' s great .
yeah ?
i mean , it' s ... perfect .
do you think chris will like it ?
you know ... are you sure about him ?
i mean , are you really sure ?
what are you talking about ?
chris .
i wanted ashley grant .
so ?
so , i told him what to say to you .
the e mails , the nursing home ... and he helped me out with ashley .
i' m sorry , maggie .
i don' t believe you .
when you' re alone with him , face to face ... does he ever say anything clever or funny or even sincere ?
he' s shy .
he' s not shy .
he' s a dumb ass .
in the theater ...
i said you were beautiful me .
i meant it .
because ...
i have feelings for you .
you' re really pathetic , do you know that ?
maggie , i  no .
i' m sorry , if things didn' t work out for you , but ... you think you could tear me and chris down because ashley broke up with you ?
listen .
no , because honestly ...
i don' t even see that guy you used to be anymore , ryan .
i see a liar ...

he' s boiling !
take me to the hotel , driver .
sheesh .
somebody' s in a hurry for some loving .
chris , this night is really important to me , okay ?
it' s important to me too .
why don' t you lie on the bed and make yourself a little more comfortable ?
good idea .
this is it .
on your back , stallion .
look , we got all night , right ?
yes , we do .
why don' t you just wait here and i' il go get us some champagne .
forgot something .
hurry back .
hey , do they have a jail out here in the woods ?
damn , these knots are pretty tight .
summer camp .
oh , god .
where good girls go bad .
this isn' t like one of those games ... when you give me a 30 second head start and then hunt me down , is it ?
don' t move .
because i' m really slow ... and not very cunning .
i' m sure you' d have me in like 45 seconds tops .
have you seen maggie carter ?
who knew you were such a freak ?
i' m surprised you didn' t .
i mean , you know so many other things about me ...
like my favorite movie .
casablanca .
you know my favorite book .
n n nine stories .
by the way ... which one' s your favorite ... of the nine stories , hmm ?
the long one .
sorry , chris .
wrong answer .
carter , you' re sort of starting to creep me out here .
there' s just one more question .
how' s it feel to be played ?
what ?
smile now , prom date .
you know , chris , there' s one thing you' re right about .
what we do tonight is probably how we' il be remembered .
is that
chris , yeah .
tell your friends .
don' t say a word .
just have me .
you do know that ... people will be looking for me and
this is really all virgil doolittle' s fault .
sure , i wanna be a legend and all , but
i was just joking around .
pulling a prank , all right ?
you should really think about it .
your future .
okay , i' il do that .
thank you .
maggie , i need to talk to you .
what , lying and cheating weren' t enough ?
now you' re breaking and entering ?
ow .
the prince ascends my balcony ...
looks deeply into my eyes and says , " ow .
how romantic .
you didn' t let me finish .
i meant , " ow .
that really hurts like hell .
but not near as bad as losing you .
or knowing that i can' t take it back .
look , i wish i could .
you lied to me .
you steered me right into that world .
made me feel like i belonged .
you do belong .
you belong with me .
talk is cheap .
if there' s one thing i' ve learned from all this , it' s that .
if i let you off the hook , do you know how much you owe me ?
i do .
the things i do for you .
got your neck back for you , gilmore .
