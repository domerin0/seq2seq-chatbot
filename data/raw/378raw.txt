a le rhne rotary won' t stall at 60 degrees .

if you continue making the movie the way you are ... ... there isn' t gonna be a distributor ... ... you won' t find anybody who wants to see the movie ... ... and you' re not gonna have any more oil money .
so welcome to hollywood .
yeah .
well , i' il be sure to remember that , mr. mayer .
good luck .

<i>rumors coming from a lonely airstrip</ i> <i>out in van nuys . </ i>
<i>sources whisper that young</ i> <i>texas industrialist howard hughes ... </ i> <i> ... won' t stop pouring money</ i> <i>into his war epic . </ i>
<i>and do we mean epic ! </ i>
<i>one hundred and thirty seven pilots, </ i> <i>87 airplanes ... </ i> <i> ... 35 cameramen , 2000 extras . </ i>
<i>how long will it be before this picture ... </ i> <i> ... ends up costing as</ i> <i>much as the real war ? </ i>
damn it .
why the hell do they look so slow ?
this isn' t what it was like up there .
they look like goddamn models !
son of a bitch .
howard ?
without something standing still behind the planes ... ... we' ve got no idea of how fast we' re moving .
we got no sense of relative motion .
call ucla .
get me the best meteorologist they got .
you get him here in an hour , all right ?
hey .
you want the good news or the bad news ?
bad news , always .
all right .
we installed the 450 radial .
struts won' t take the vibration .
minute we fire her up , the struts start cracking at the attach points .
well , what' s the good news ?
there isn' t any .
goddamn it , odie .
if the 450' s too big , we figure something else out .
we' ve done everything .
we' ve rebuilt her from top to toe .
if we drain the fuel tank ... ... she might make 180 miles per hour .
i want minimum 200 , all right ?
i want a date with theda bara .
that ain' t gonna happen .
oh , don' t be so sure .
if the struts won' t sustain the engine we need , we gotta get rid of the struts .
no , then the top wing falls off .
then let it .
what ?
who says we need a top wing ?
i mean , who says we need anything ?
a monoplane .
a cantilevered monoplane , right ?
they' re doing it in france .
to hell with the top wing and struts .
a 550 wasp engine .
one hundred octane fuel .
that would give us a horsepower of what ?
seven hundred .
we squeeze that to a thousand , we got the fastest plane ever built .
you know , i' ve gotta say ... ... we' ve already spent over $200, 000 rebuilding this plane .
to hell with it .
tear it up , odie .
go on .
well ...
the cumulonimbus formations about which you speak ... ... that look like ...
giant breasts full of milk .
i want clouds , damn it .
yes , clouds ... ... that look like giant breasts full of milk ... ... cannot exactly be guaranteed for any particular occasion .
so you might have to ...
to wait .
then we' il wait .
look , whatever they pay you at ucla ... ... i' m doubling it , all right ?
you work for me now .
find some clouds .
find some clouds .
find me some clouds !
welcome to <i>hell' s angels</ i> .
thank you .
i' ve been to chatsworth , santa cruz , encino , san diego ... ... riverside , van nuys and bakersfield .
it has been eight months !
where are my goddamn clouds , huh ?
they move , mr. hughes !
clouds move .
that' s what they do .
they move !
you see that ?
it is costing me $5271 a day ... ... to keep those planes on the ground .
you find me some goddamn clouds , huh ?
nice day .
yeah , very funny .
i got a call from houston .
they' re getting nervous .
stop showing them the damn bills .
that would be illegal .
shit , no .
maybe it' s a little bit naughty .
hughes tool is incorporated in texas .
they have to see the bills .
incorporate a new division out here .
we' il call it hughes aircraft .
do we need these rivets on the cowling ?
yeah , or the reverse thrust would rip it off .
they' re gonna give me drag .
do something about that .
wind resistance on rivets ?
i want her slippery .
there are tax consequences to incorporating in california .
just take care of it , would you ?
mr. hughes !
oakland !
we have clouds in oakland !
you mean it this time ?
yes !
goddamn it , yes .
i can promise you .
clouds in oakland .
all right , don' t get all jittery now .

a lighter shade .
i don' t want to look like boris karloff .
if you know what i mean .
i read in the magazines that you play golf .
on occasion .
well , how about nine holes ?
now , mr. hughes ?
if it would be convenient , miss hepburn .
you' re not extending enough on your follow through .
follow through is everything in golf , just like life .
don' t you find ?
saw your <i>scarface</ i> picture .
violent .
realistic .
movies are movies , howard .
not life .
now the stage .
the stage is real .
real flesh and blood .
human beings right out there in front of you , buster .
can' t look away .
can' t munch popcorn .
that would be rude .
do you like the theater ?
no .
oh , i adore the theater .
only alive on stage .
i' il teach you .
we' il see some ibsen .
if the republicans haven' t outlawed him by now .
you' re not a republican , are you ?
how did you vote in ' 32 ?
well , i didn' t .
you must !
it' s your sacred franchise .
heard you were wooing ginger rogers .
what about that ?
she' s just a friend .
men can' t be friends with women .
they must possess them or leave them be .
it' s a primitive urge from caveman days .
it' s all in darwin .
hunt the flesh , kill the flesh , eat the flesh .
that' s the male sex all over .
excuse me ?
well , if you' re deaf , you must own up to it .
get a hearing aid .
or see my father .
he' s a urologist , but it' s all tied up inside the body , don' t you find ?
me , i keep healthy .
i take seven showers a day to keep clean .
also because i am what' s so vulgarly referred to as " outdoorsy .
i' m not outdoorsy .
i' m athletic .
i sweat .
there it is .
now we both know the sordid truth .
i sweat and you' re deaf .
aren' t we a fine pair of misfits ?
three .
noble effort .
so i suppose you' re wooing me now ?
oh , well .
not enough .
not enough .
these rivets have to be completely flush .
i want every screw and joint countersunk .
i want no wind resistance on the fuselage .
she has got to be clean , odie .
clean .
understand ?
okay , howard .
i don' t know what else to tell you .
what do you got for me ?
the thing is , twa needs a new plane .
a modern plane .
oh , yeah ?
what kind of plane ?
okay .
the dc 3 has 21 daytime seats ... ... and 14 overnight berths .
something bigger ?
try 50 seats with a ceiling of 12, 000 feet .
no .
no , 20, 000 .
think about it .
what does 20, 000 feet give you ?
less turbulence .
because it' s above the weather .
jack , we wanna fly above the weather .
only 1 percent of the american population has set foot on an airliner .
why ?
because they' re scared to death .
they should be .
i mean , 7000 feet is bumpy as shit .
you know that .
we build a plane that flies above the weather ... ... we could get every man , woman and child in this country to feel safe .
an airplane with the ability to fly into the substratosphere across the country .
across the world .
now that is the future .
you with me ?
yeah .
i don' t wanna get into this if your board doesn' t have the balls for it .
would they support us ?
i don' t know .
what' s your financial picture ?
not great .
last year' s deficit ?
770, 000 .
what' s it selling at ?
about 8 dollars a share .
that' s the lowest it' s been , huh ?
i could do that .
do what ?
buy it .
you wanna buy the airline ?
for crying out loud ... ... we don' t want pencil pushers getting in the way of us making our plane .
give me brass tacks , now .
what does controlling interest in twa cost me ?
call it 15 million .
that is a chunk of change , huh ?
you call noah dietrich .
you have him start buying .
howard , hold on .
are you sure ?
you wanna think about it for five minutes ?
hell , jack , i got a tiger by the tail here .
i ain' t gonna let it go .
good evening , mr. hughes .
welcome .
your table is ready .
how goes the aviation ?
oh , just fine , pete .
i' m so glad .
good evening , mr. hughes .
madame .
it' s " miss .
miss .
the usual , mr. hughes ?
please .
may i recommend for the lady ... ... our clementine soup followed by roast duck with currant glaze ... ... and poached pears in rose sauce .
it' s truly divine .
yeah .
that sounds fine .
your kind of joint , is it ?
wouldn' t have thought .
they' re open late .
i go to a hot dog stand on la cienega too .
they' re open till about 4 .
are they ?
how marvelous .
howard !
howard !
hi !

mr. flynn .
yes .
kate .
kate .
kate of the clenched jawed hepburns .

you should use lux on your hands , by the way .
i do .
you and howard ought to cook up a picture .
costar with errol .
i could sell that in spades .
that would be marvelous .
howard ?
i think not .
don' t you read <i>variety</ i> , mr. meyer ?
well , i' m box office poison .

washed up , day old fish not worth the eating , so they tell me .
hell with them .

soulless pricks to a man , right ?
johnny tells me you' re thinking about doing a western , of all goddamn things .
are you making a western , howard ?
yeah .
making a western .
i' m gonna call it <i>the outlaw</ i> .
yeah .
and you know what it' s about ?
s e x.
it' s all about s e x.
it' s a western .
you can' t have fornication in a western .
it isn' t done .
it' s not real sex , it' s movie sex .
what <i>scarface</ i> did for the gangster picture , <i>the outlaw</ i> will do for the western .
put the sex and guts and blood up there on the screen .
have you seen my cigarettes ?
don' t mind us .
new york cut steak , 12 peas , bottle of milk with the cap on .
you can' t afford your own cigarettes ?
jack has all my money .
i hope your food isn' t getting cold at your table somewhere or something .
no , no .
we' re here all night .
don' t worry .
now , howard .
now , howard .
if you' re seriously talking about putting carnality ... ... back on the silver screen , you must swear to let me in on the casting session .
i have an eye for talent .
isn' t that right ?
you ought to give up prancing in tights ... ... be a talent scout .
that prancing paid for my new yacht .
you must all come sailing with me .
catalina .
what do you say ?
catalina .
sounds grand .
yeah .
i' ve even managed to coax ... ... the luscious miss de havilland and her equally luscious sister to come .
though i fear their mother will insist on coming , to preserve their questionable virtue .
we shall assault these twin monuments of pristine britannic beauty nonetheless .
what do you say , howard ?
yeah ?
yeah .
yeah .
yeah ?
i gotta go .
if you' il excuse us , we have ... we have to be somewhere .
you are somewhere , howard , you madman .
somewhere else .
excuse us .
charmed , gentlemen .
do help yourself to the poached pears .
i hear they' re divine .
well .
howard hughes , ladies and gentlemen .
was that meant for me ?
my hero .
god , all that hollywood talk bores me silly .
as if there aren' t more important things , like mussolini .
where are we going , by the way ?
do you feel like a little adventure ?
do your worst , mr. hughes .
think you own this place , you limey bastard ?
i' m a tasmanian bastard , you prick .
thataway , errol .
let me at him !
that' s mr. mayer' s house right there .
do you know where jack warner lives ?
what' s that on the steering wheel ?
cellophane .
if you had any idea of the crap that people carry around on their hands .
what kind of crap ?
you don' t wanna know .
hold on to the wheel for a bit .
that' s too hard .
relax your hand .
relax your hand .
you see , you gotta feel the vibration of the engine through your fingertips .
do you feel that ?
yes .
well , that' s good .
golly !
well , she' s all yours .
where are you going ? !
i think there' s some milk back here .
you just keep us steady , now .
all right .
howard .
yeah ?
there' s a rather alarming mountain heading our way .
pull back on the wheel a smidge .
go on .
golly !
i don' t think i' ve ever met someone who actually uses the word " golly .
you all right ?
do you want me to take over ?
just when i' m getting the hang of it ?
you want some milk ?
oh , please .
utterly smashing !
we' il do it again .
i' m free wednesday .
it' s a little early for golf , though .
oh , no , no .
i live right there .
feel like a drink ?
lead on .
now , that makes for a challenging par four .
my decorator picked out the wallpaper and such .
he' s queer as a bedbug .
but i just hate this room .
gives me the willies .
like i' m about to be swallowed up by the latest issue of <i>town</ i> & <i>country</ i> .
