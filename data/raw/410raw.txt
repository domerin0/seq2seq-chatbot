we gotta report this mess !
look , i haven' t been able to reach shit in two weeks !
i doubt if anybody' s talked to anybody on this entire continent , and you want me to reach somebody !
maybe we at war with norway .
i was wondering when el capitan was gonna get a chance to use his popgun .
how long they been stationed there ?
it says here only eight weeks .
that' s not long enough for guys to go bonkers .
bullshit , bwana .
five minutes is enough to put a man over down here .
damn straight .
i mean , look at palmer .
he been the way he is since the first day .
how many in their party ?
they started with ten .
there' d be eight others left .
how do we know ?
guys as crazy as that could have done a lot of damage to their own before they got to us .
nothing we can do .
oh , yes there is .
i want to go up .
in this weather ?
bennings ?
winds are gonna let up a tad next couple of hours .
a tad ?
can' t condone it much myself , but it is a short haul .
an hour there , an hour back .
shit , doc , i' il give you the lift .
no problem .
forget it , palmer .
thanks for thinkin ' about it though .
loaded with kerosene .
i count 15 cans .
macready !
mac , get your gear on .
it may not clear up for a week , and we' re the closest to ' em .
it' s all right by me , doc .
i' m just letting you know we' re taking a chance .
quit griping , macready .
if we get caught in a white out , you can scratch one doctor and one pilot .
this is real thin .
it' il clear as soon as you get up .
it' s up to you , mac .
if you don' t wanna fly , we don' t fly .
you really wanna save those crazy swedes , huh ?
norwegians .
which way , doc ?
southwest .
you have to read the map ' cause i' m gonna be busy .
mac' s really taking it up , huh ?
he knows what he' s doing .
nauls , will you turn that crap down ?
i' m trying to get some sleep .
i was shot today .
oui , bwana .
will do . ?
very superstitious ?
?
writing' s on the wall ?
?
very superstitious ?
anybody there ?
hey , sweden ?
they' re not swedish , mac , they' re norwegian .
mac !
my god !
what the hell happened here ?
come on , doc .
portable video unit .
anything ?
it' s all in norwegian .
what are ya doin ' , doc ?
it could be important work .
i wanna take it back with us .
it' s gettin ' late .
let' s hurry it up .
i' il check out the last few rooms .
hey , copper , come here !
maybe they found a fossil , the remains of some animal buried in the ice ,
and they chopped it out .
but where is it ?
look at this .
what is that ?
is that a man in there or something ?
whatever it is , they burned it up in a hurry .
help me find a shovel , doc .
we found this .
jesus christ !
blair , i' d like you to start an autopsy right away .
did you reach anybody yet ?
reach anybody ?
we' re a thousand miles from nowhere , man , and it' s gonna get a hell of a lot worse before it gets any better !
well , stick to it , windows , stick to it .
nothin ' wrong with this norwegian , physiologically anyway .
no drugs , no alcohol , nothin ' .
hmm .
well , what we got here is what appears to be , anyway , a normal set of internal organs .
heart ,
lungs , kidneys , liver , intestines .
seem to be normal .
... one , door number two and door number three .
i think that dawn screen here has got the most to trade in .
i went to you first .
you brought your friend , anna .
you' ve been consulting anna all through the show .
you may as well consult her one more time .
i know how this one ends .
clark , will you put this mutt with the others where it belongs ?
yeah , okay .
go ahead .
go ahead .
what are you waiting for ?
i don' t know what the hell' s in there .
it' s weird and pissed off , whatever it is .
bennings , go get childs .
what is this ?
what' s goin ' on ?
hey , palmer , what is this ?
i don' t know .
childs !
mac wants the flamethrower !
mac wants the what ?
that' s what he said !
now , move !
damn it !
stand back .
mac , what is it ?
no !
no !
god !
don' t !
don' t !
no !
get back !
get back !
get your ass over here !
burn it !
damn it , childs , torch it !
oh , my god .
oh !
ohh !
look .
son of a bitch .
what we' re talking about here is an organism ... that imitates other life forms , and it imitates them perfectly .
when this thing attacked our dogs , it tried to digest ' em , absorb them .
and in the process shape its own cells to imitate them .
this , for instance .
that' s not dog .
it' s imitation .
we got to it before it had time to finish .
finish what ?
finish imitating these dogs .
easy .
easy .
good .
easy .
easy .
clark ?
yeah ?
did you notice anything strange about the dog , anything at all ?
strange ?
no .
what was the dog doing in the rec room ?
i don' t know .
he was just wandering around camp all day .
are you sayin ' to me the dog wasn' t put in the kennel until last night ?
right .
how long were you alone with that dog ?
i don' t know , an hour , hour and a half maybe .
what the hell you lookin ' at me like that for ?
i don' t know .
what ?
i don' t know .
it' s probably nothin ' .
it' s nothin ' at all .
how much more of this crap is there ?
oh , nine hours i' d say .
we can' t learn anything from this .
guess not .
where' d they take these shots ?
seems like they were spending a lot of their time ... in a little place northeast of their camp about five or six miles .
what' s that ?
it looks like something buried under the ice .
and look at that , they' re planting thermite charges .
whatever it was , it was bigger than the block of ice you found .
here .
this is it , the place where they were spending most of their time .
pretty nasty out .
35 knots .
screw it .
i' m gonna go up anyway .
half a mile due east .
jesus !
how long you figure this has been in the ice ?
well , the backscatter effect' s been bringin ' things up ... from way down around here for a long time .
i' d say ...
i' d say the ice it' s buried in ... is 100, 000 years old at least .
and those norwegians blew it up .
yeah .
i don' t know .
thousands of years ago it crashes and this thing ... gets thrown out or crawls out and it ends up freezing in the ice .
i just cannot believe any of this voodoo bullshit .
childs , happens all the time , man .
they' re fallin ' out of the skies like flies .
government knows all about it .
right , mac ?
do you believe any of this voodoo bullshit , blair ?
childs ?
childs , chariots of the gods , man .
they practically own south america .
i mean , they taught the incas everything they know .
so , come on now , macready .
the norwegians get ahold of this ...
and they dig it up out of the ice .
yes , garry , they dig it up , they cart it back , it gets thawed out , wakes up , probably not in the best of moods .
i don' t know ...
which one of you disrespectful men ... been tossin ' his dirty drawers in the kitchen trash can , huh ?
from now on , i want my kitchen clean , all right ?
germ free !
now , how' s this motherfucker wake up after thousands of years in the ice ?
and how can it look like a dog ?
i don' t know how .
' cause it' s different than us , see .
' cause it' s from outer space .
what do you want from me ?
ask him .
you buy any of this , blair ?
mac , we' re movin ' those things out of the lab into the storeroom .
can you come get your stuff ?
be there in a minute , doc .
through the door .
right over there .
right over there .
sorry , mac .
you have to move your stuff ...
doc says we gotta stash ' em in here and lock ' em up .
i have to talk to you .
i' m tired of talking , fuchs .
i just want to get up to my shack and get drunk .
mac , it' s important .
what is it ?
outside .
it' s 40 below outside .
in the thiokol .
please , mac .
we ought to just burn these things .
can' t burn the find of the century .
that' s gonna win somebody the nobel prize .
you got the keys ?
get ' em from garry .
i want to get some stuff out of here .
there' s something wrong with blair .
he' s locked in his room and won' t answer the door .
i took one of his notebooks from the lab .
listen .
yeah ?
it could have imitated a million life forms on a million planets .
it could change into any one of them at any time .
now it wants life forms on earth ...
it' s gettin ' cold ,
and i haven' t slept in two days .
wait a minute , mac .
it needs to be alone and in close proximity with the life form to be absorbed .
the chameleon strikes in the dark .
is blair cracking up ?
damn it , macready .
there' s still cellular activity in these burned remains .
they' re not dead yet .
let' s go , bennings .
i gotta get some sleep .
holy shit .
go get the doc .
i' il get garry .
we' il meet in blair' s room .
all right .
it' s bennings !
bennings was right there , mac !
i swear it had ahold of him !
windows , get back !
keep away from him !
don' t touch him !
get back !
stay back !
it isn' t bennings !
my god !
what was happening to him ?
if it had time to finish , it would have looked and sounded and acted just like bennings !
i don' t know what you' re saying .
that was one of those things , trying to imitate him , garry .
come on .
macready , i' ve known bennings for ten years .
he' s my friend .
we gotta burn the rest of them .
all right , step back .
you sure that' s all of ' em ?
we cleaned out the storehouse , the lab .
there is nothing left .
where' s blair ?
i can' t find blair .
where' s everybody else ?
windows is in the radio room still trying to get through .
everyone else is in the rec room .
you go on .
i' il be in in a minute .
blair ?
blair ?
don' t come in here !
i got a gun !
i got an ax !
don' t , you son of a bitch !
don' t come in here !
you understand me ?
he' s got a gun , mac !
anybody interferes , i' il kill ' im !
jesus !
he smashed up some of the chopper pretty good .
childs , go see if he got to the tractor .
nobody gets in and out of here !
nobody !
you guys think i' m crazy !
well , that' s fine !
most of ya don' t know what' s going on around here !
but i' m damn well sure some of you do !
christ !
he got most of the chopper and the tractor , and he' s killed the rest of the dogs .
garry , wait a minute !
wait a minute !
all right , childs , go around to the map room door .
talk to him .
okay .
go on .
norris , get a table from the lab .
do you think that thing wanted to be an animal ?
no dogs make it a thousand miles through the cold .
no , you don' t understand !
that thing wanted to be us !
a cell gets out , it could imitate everything on the face of the earth !
and nothing could stop it !
okay , blair .
come on now , you don' t want to hurt anybody .
i' il kill you !
good shot , macready .
excuse me .
all right , bring him up .
lift him up .
yeah .
okay .
okay .
come on , blair .
what about your shack , macready ?
i don' t want him in my shack .
we' il lock him in the toolshed .
why am i in here ?
for your own protection , blair ... and ours .
how you doin ' , old boy ?
i don' t know who to trust .
i know what you mean , blair .
trust is a tough thing to come by these days .
tell you what ?
why don' t you just trust in the lord ?
watch clark .
what ?
i said , " watch clark .
and watch him close , do you hear me ?
now the radio' s gone .
so are the choppers .
we' re completely cut off .
all we can do now is hole up ' til spring and wait for the rescue team .
no , we don' t wait .
somebody in this camp ain' t what he appears .
right now that may be one or two of us .
by spring it could be all of us .
so how do we know who' s human ?
if i was an imitation ... a perfect imitation ... how would you know if it was really me ?
is there some kind of test , doc ?
well , yeah ... possibly .
i' ve been thinking about a blood serum test .
what' s that ?
we could take a sample of each person' s blood .
we could mix it with uncontaminated blood .
i suppose if there' s a reaction , we' d know who isn' t human .
we' ve got whole blood in storage .
here , start working on it .
keep an eye on clark .
he was close to that dog .
yeah .
yeah .
mac , we need blair' s help .
he' s the only one ...
who knows what this organism is capable of .
he' s too far gone , fuchs .
but get the rest of his notebooks and start going through them .
garry !
hey , you guys , come here !
what ?
somebody got to the blood !
what ?
where' s clark ?
right here .
wait a minute , wait a minute .
was this broken into ?
no , the lock is undamaged .
somebody opened it , closed it , then locked it .
great .
who' s got access to it ?
i guess i' m the only one .
and i got the only key .
would that test have worked , doc ?
oh , i think so , yes .
somebody else sure as hell thought so .
well , who else could have used that key ?
nobody !
i just give it to copper whenever he needs it !
could anybody have gotten it from you , doc ?
i don' t see how .
as soon as i' m finished , i return it right away .
great .
when was the last time you used it ?
a day or so ago .
i suppose somebody could have lifted it off me ...
oh , come on !
that key ring is always hooked to your belt .
accusing everybody ...
stop it now !
it ain' t worth it !
copper' s the only one who' s got any business with it .
wait a minute !
you' ve been in here on several occasions !
doc thought of the test .
that clears him ?
bullshit !
why would he take ...
shut up , man !
windows !
windows !
put that down .
no .
i' il put this right through your head .
you guys gonna listen to garry , let him give the orders ?
he could be one of those things !
windows , wait a minute .
just take it easy .
put the gun down .
put it down .
garry , you don' t want to hurt anybody .
get back .
on the floor .
it' s on the floor .
i don' t know about copper , but i give you my word , i did not go near that blood .
but i guess you' il all feel a little easier ... if somebody else was in charge .
norris , i can' t see anybody objecting to you .
i' m sorry , fellas , but i i i' m not up to it .
i' il take it .
like hell you will .
it should be somebody a little more even tempered , childs .
all right .
i know i' m human .
and if you were all these things , then you' d just attack me right now .
so some of you are still human .
this thing doesn' t want to show itself .
it wants to hide inside an imitation .
it' il fight if it has to , but it' s vulnerable out in the open .
if it takes us over , then it has no more enemies , nobody left to kill it .
and then it' s won .
there' s a storm hitting us in six hours .
we' re gonna find out who' s who .
all right , doc , garry and clark move over there away from the others .
norris , you and childs shoot ' em up with morphine .
tie ' em down and watch ' em .
fuchs , you start workin ' on a new test .
i need doc' s help .
yeah , you don' t want to drug me .
mac , i' m not a prisoner !
here , let me do it .
you' re gonna break the needle in my arm .
no , doc .
he' s doin ' a real fine job .
i' m gonna hide this tape when i' m finished .
if none of us make it , at least there' il be some kind of record .
storm' s been hitting us hard now for 48 hours .
we still have nothing to go on .
one other thing .
i think it rips through your clothes when it takes you over .
windows found some shredded long johns , but the name tag was missing .
they could be anybody' s .
nobody ...
nobody trusts anybody now .
and we' re all very tired .
nobody trusts anybody now .
there' s nothing else i can do .
just wait .
r. j. macready , helicopter pilot , u. s. outpost number 31 .
you come up with anything yet ?
one or two ideas .
but , macready , i' ve been thinking .
if a small particle of this thing is enough to take over an entire organism , then everyone should prepare their own meals .
i suggest we only eat out of cans .
all right .
who' s that ?
anybody see fuchs ?
somebody blew out a fuse in the lab .
lights were out for an hour .
any one of us could have gotten to him .
all right , we gotta find him .
nauls , why don' t you come with me and we' il look outside .
palmer , you and windows check the inside .
i ain' t goin ' with windows .
i ain' t goin ' with him .
i' il go with childs .
hey , fuck you , palmer !
i ain' t goin ' with you !
who says i want you goin ' with me ?
all right , cut the bullshit !
windows , you come with us .
norris , you stay here .
any of them move , you fry ' em .
you hear anything at all , you cut loose on the sirens .
we all meet back here in 20 minutes , regardless !
and everybody watch whoever you' re with , real close .
hey , blair !
blair , have you seen fuchs ?
i don' t want to stay out here anymore .
i want to come back inside .
funny things .
i hear funny things out here .
have you come across fuchs ?
it ain' t fuchs .
it ain' t fuchs .
i' m not gonna harm anybody , and there' s nothing wrong with me .
and if there was , i' m all better now .
i' d like to come back inside .
you got my promise .
we' il see .
hey , wait a minute .
wait a minute , man .
i want to come back inside .
don' t you understand ?
i' m all right .
i' m much better .
i won' t harm anybody .
you gotta let me come back inside .
hold it !
is it fuchs ?
yeah .
why would it burn him ?
flare .
maybe he tried to burn it .
maybe he burned himself ... before it could get to him .
great !
now what are we gonna do ?
you go inside .
tell the others we found fuchs .
we' il be in as soon as we can .
where are we goin ' ?
up to my shack .
what the hell for ?
' cause when i left , i turned the lights off .
how long have they been out there ?
forty , forty five minutes .
we better start closing off the outside doors .
hey !
all of you come here !
open up !
open up this door !
open up !
open up !
close that door .
where' s macready ?
i cut him loose of the line up by his shack .
cut him loose ?
yeah .
we were up checkin ' around his place .
i found this .
look .
it was stashed in his own oil furnace .
wind must have dislodged it , but i don' t think he saw me find it .
i made sure i got ahead of him on the towline on the way back .
i cut him loose .
macready ?
he' s one of them .
when did it get to him ?
i don' t know .
it could have been anytime , anywhere .
if it did get to him .
look , childs , come on !
when the lights went out !
that would have been the perfect time .
right !
you said guys were missing .
and , windows , where were you ?
palmer , i told you to shut the fuck up !
where were you when the lights when out ?
to pit us against each other !
guys !
it' s macready .
shh !
let' s open it .
hell no !
do you think he' s changed into one of those things ?
he' s had plenty of time .
nothing human could have made it back here without a guideline .
let' s open it now !
why are you so damn anxious to let him in here ?
' cause it' s so close !
may be our best chance to blow it away !
no !
just let him freeze to death outside .
what if we' re wrong about him ?
why , then we' re wrong !
supply window !
all right , all right .
we got no choice now !
damn it !
he' s got the keys !
what' s goin ' on ?
the towline snapped .
that' s bullshit , childs .
he knows damn well i cut it .
you' re a dead man , macready !
or a dead whatever the hell you are !
anyone messes with me and the whole camp goes .
come on , childs , burn me .
put those torches on the floor and back off .
back off .
way off .
you asshole .
you' d have done the same thing .
don' t argue with him .
where' s the rest ?
so help me , i mean it !
it' s cool , macready .
it' s cool , man !
come on !
yeah , yeah , man .
just relax .
anybody touches me , and we go .
he' s not breathin ' !
go untie the doc .
get him in here .
and bring the others .
from now on , nobody gets out of my sight .
lay him there .
so you sweethearts ... were about to have yourselves a little lynching party , huh ?
i might just have to put an end to you on general principles , nauls .
did it occur to the jury that anybody could have stuck some of my clothes up the furnace ?
we ain' t buyin ' that .
quit that bickering over there !
windows , wheel that defibrillator over here !
put some gel on those paddles !
you' re gonna have to sleep sometime , macready .
i' m a real light sleeper , childs .
if anyone tries to wake me ...
uh uh .
clear !
clear !
clear .
we' re on fire , macready !
get back !
just wait !
we' re on fire !
just wait !
all right , go !
windows !
windows , get in here !
you gotta be fuckin ' kidding .
what do you got in mind , macready ?
a little test .
windows , you and palmer tie everybody down real tight .
what for ?
for your health .
let' s rush him !
he' s not gonna blow us all up !
no , no , wait a minute .
wait a minute .
let' s do what mac says .
i mean , he wasted norris pretty quick , didn' t he ?
that' s close enough , clark .
he ain' t tyin ' me up .
then i' il have to kill you .
then kill me .
i mean it .
i guess you do .
this is bullshit , mac !
finish it , palmer .
they' re dead , mac !
windows ?
yo ?
you tie up palmer over here .
we' re gonna draw a little bit of everybody' s blood .
' cause we' re gonna find out who' s the thing .
watching norris in there gave me the idea that ... maybe every part of him was a whole .
every little piece was an individual animal ... with a built in desire to protect its own life .
you see , when a man bleeds , it' s just tissue .
but blood from one of you things won' t obey when it' s attacked .
it' il try and survive ; crawl away from a hot needle , say .
now you .
that' s good .
all right , move back .
over there .
i guess you' re okay .
all right , put that on and watch them .
now i' il show you what i already know .
that' s a crock of shit .
let' s try the doc and clark .
now clark .
then clark was human , huh ?
which makes you a murderer , don' t it ?
palmer now .
this is pure nonsense .
it doesn' t prove a thing .
i thought you' d feel that way , garry .
you were the only one that could have got to that blood .
we' il do you last .
get away from me !
macready , burn it !
what is it ?
get him , get him !
just shoot !
macready , shoot !
get it , mac !
get it !
windows !
blast him !
get me outta here !
windows !
damn !
get me outta here !
macready !
get in here !
quick , come on !
hurry up !
it' s coming back !
burn it !
burn it , for god' s sake !
burn it !
burn it !
hurry up , macready !
let' s do it .
get me outta here !
cut me loose !
cut me the hell ...
come on , get me outta here !
come on , get me outta here !
cut me loose , damn it !
i know you gentlemen have been through a lot , but when you find the time ,
i' d rather not spend the rest of this winter ... tied to this fucking couch !
childs ... we' re goin ' out to give blair the test .
if he tries to make it back and we' re not with him , burn him .
mac , the door is open .
how' d he get out ?
the door was bolted from the outside .
blair ?
hey , blair !
you down there ?
we got something for ya !
blair' s been busy out here all by himself .
what is it ?
something he' s been making .
it' s a ship of some kind .
he stole the parts from the helicopter .
smart s . o . b .
he put it together piece by piece .
where was he tryin ' to go ?
anyplace but here .
hey , you guys , come here .
come here .
i think i saw childs outside the main entrance of the camp .
what' s he doing outside ?
i don' t know .
got a flare ?
he got back inside and blew the generator .
in six hours , it' il be 100 below in here .
well , that' s suicide !
not for that thing .
it wants to freeze now .
it' s got no way outta here .
it just wants to go to sleep until the rescue team finds it .
what can we do ?
what can we do ?
whether we make it or not , we can' t let that thing freeze again .
maybe we' il just warm things up a little around here .
we' re not gettin ' outta here alive ... but neither is that thing .
generator room .
generator' s gone .
any way we can fix it ?
it' s gone , macready .
all right .
we gotta bring this whole place right down into the ice .
garry , plant yours in the old storage room .
nauls , down by the generator .
oh , god .
how' s it comin ' in there ?
i said , " how' s it ...
yeah , fuck you too !
you the only one who made it ?
not the only one .
did you kill it ?
where were you , childs ?
thought i saw blair .
i went out after him ... and got lost in the storm .
fires got the temperature up all over the camp .
won' t last long though .
neither will we .
how will we make it ?
maybe we shouldn' t .
