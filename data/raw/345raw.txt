that' s why i travel around so much .
i get it from my daddy .
he' s a traveling salesman .

if you can remember them , you wasn' t there .
want me to check under the hood ?
no .
it' s rented .
you come to detroit and you rent a beemer ?
that' s like going to germany and eating jimmy dean sausages .

i was 22 before i knew foreigners made cars .
are you from tennessee ?
yes , ma' am , i' m a southern boy .

i do ?
yeah , a boy .
a man .

fifteen years ago .
i never went to mexico , but ...
you laugh like him .
i didn' t mean to .
you look like him .
i don' t know what to tell you .

you have a nice day .
billy ray ?
ma' am ?

i hope nobody' s looking .
there .
satisfied ?
right arm .
i got some shrapnel in vietnam .
it' s down my side .
want to see it ?
i' m sorry .
my friend would have never been in that war .
meaning what ?
he was very much against killing .
i' d like to help you , sir , but officer baird is retired .
that' s not possible !
he wouldn' t retire without telling me .
he' s been handling my case for the last 15 years .
give me your current name and id , and i' il connect you with your new case officer .
with all due respect , i don' t know who the hell you are .
if i give you my name and number , you' il know everything .
hold , please .
no , hang on .
damn it !
hello ?
excuse me .
that call you' ve been waiting for ?
he' s on the line .
he won' t give me his current name or location .
he wants lou baird .
rick ?
how you doing ?
this is joe weyburn .
remember me ?
i set you up at that photo lab in cleveland .
was it 1978 ?
no , 1979 .
i don' t remember you .
you know us fbi guys all look alike .
you are one rolling stone , aren' t you ?
where are you now , rick ?
where' s lou ?
he would have told me he was retiring .
why didn' t he do that ?
to tell you the truth , he lost you .
he lost me ?
yeah .
that' s why we put him out to pasture , why i' m on the case .
where is he ?
where did he retire to ?
where did he retire to ?
he once gave me a number .
his sister' s place in st. louis .
he used to go there on vacations .
is that where he is ?
am i getting warm ?
he' s out of the picture .
are you in some kind of trouble ?
not at all .
where' s sorenson ?
still safely in jail as far as i know .
nothing to worry about .
he' s never getting out !
his partner ?
diggs ?
yeah .
unless he' s made another pass at you ... ... he' s probably got his drug money living the good life in south america .
we have no idea where he is .
that' s a relief .
so what is it ... ... relocation time ?
i guess .
where can you put me ?
where are you now ?
and what name are you using ?
come on , i' m just trying to do my job .
bowers , billy ray .
i live above marvin' s motown motors .
1840 canoga street , detroit .
did you get that ?
i' m not repeating it .
somebody recognized me .
i want to get out before they come back .
right .
two days .
two days ?
hang on and we' il have somebody come in and get you .
okay , i' il be hanging .
the drop in foreign sales ... ... reflects both the negative effect of the strengthening dollar ... ... and an upsurge in competitive production in europe and asia .
add this to the recent surcharge imposed by the eec nations ... ... it' s clear that to preserve the profit our shareholders expect ... ... we have to make cuts to our production costs .
while it is true our rising costs ... ... will be defrayed by the acquisition of coleman shipping , we should be clear ...
you' re freaking me out !
all those opposed ?
if miss graves will respond ?
miss graves !
yes .
no .
you are abstaining from the final vote ?
yes .
no , i am not .
i see .
she says to me , " marvin , you' re not getting any younger .
think about that young man working for you , and offer him a partnership .
we don' t have no sons .
you ain' t known me but three months .
how do you know you can trust me to stick around or not steal from you ?
i got my eyes on you .
the hand is quicker than the eye .
i' m going upstairs and get some sleep .
see you in the morning .
think about that partnership .
i' il see you in the morning .
that mean it' s a deal ?
i sure will think about it .
good night .
pumps are closed .
pumps are closed .
she won' t be humming again till 6 : 30 a . m .
you billy ray bowers ?
y' all from weyburn' s office ?
y' all got an interesting accent .
shit .
you always were an actor , weren' t you , rick ?
you pretended to be my friend .
i never did .
then you turned on me .
i never agreed to help you kill .
still a do gooder ?
my friend , mr. diggs , is worried about that .
i' ve served my time , thanks to you , but he' s still under indictment .
seeing as you' re the only living witness that can put him behind bars ...
what' s he got on you ?
you still his flunky ?
are you some hero ?
hiding in a grease pit for 15 years ?
i don' t think they' il put up any monuments for you .
any last words ?
what' s going on ?
get out of here !
run for your damn life !
watch out !
help !
let me in !
rick , is that you ?
yeah , it' s me !
let me in !
how do i know it' s you ?

i' ve been shot in the butt .
can you believe it ?
can i come in ?
i' m naked .
can you handle it ?
i handled it for a lot of years .
i guess i can handle it now .
it' s my lower back and my butt .
i think the pellet passed through ...
vietnam ?
hell , no .
i took the dove off with a sander .
i really am anxious to hear this story .
i need some bandages , antibiotic and some antiseptic .
get shot often ?
only twice before .
could you please help me ?
could you look at my butt ?
you leave me at the altar .
that was my state of mind at the time .
you went off with jamie to seek your fortune ... ... and you were coming back to marry me .
am i remembering this correctly ?
if not , correct me .
you get lost in your plane .
reported missing , presumed dead .
i attend your memorial service , and cried the tears of a grieving widow .
i vow i' il never get over you .
in fact , i never do .
i still carry your damn pictures in my wallet !
until one day , i pull into a gas station ... ... and you' re alive with people chasing you and you ask me to look at your butt ?
that' s kind of neat .
rick' s alive and he' s shot in the butt .
guess who' s alive and shot in the butt ?
rick !
i' m looking at his butt now !
you lying ... ... gutless ... ... son of a ... ... yellow snodbugger , toad , bellybutton ...
i can' t think of enough awful things to say about you , you bastard !
i guess that' s a no on examining my butt .
i' il get it .
it' s probably for me .
you can' t answer my phone .
hello ?
yes .
fine .
taking a shower .
i' m coming home tomorrow .
okay .
' bye .
same guy ?
what guy ?
harper .
jeremy ill .
rich boy , redneck asshole .
the one you married .
you remember him ?
you know i got married ?
yeah .
four months after i disappeared .
that' s pretty quick work for a grieving widow .
where were you ?
you could have waited to find out .
i was lonely .
you were lonely so you married the joke of the campus !
jerry the napalm king .
how could you do that ?
we had it wrong .
his family made laundry detergent .
cornwall chemicals ?
no .
kitchen cleanser .
don' t kid yourself .
they were getting rich off the war .
the war ?
was that it ?
you were dodging the draft ?
or were you too gutless to tell me you didn' t want to marry me ?
are you all right ?
yeah .
i just feel a little woozy .
i better call the doctor .
no doctors .
four seasons hotel .
is this the front desk ?
is there a pharmacy ?
yes , certainly .
please send up gauze pads , tape and hydrogen peroxide .

we' il see what happens .
sarge , better take a look at this .

we are at the top of a veritable fortress .
yes !
presidents , oil sheiks stay here .
friends of lee lacocca stay here .
george harrison stays here .

what did you order ?
what did you order ?
i ordered ... ... grapefruit , croissant ...
and what ?
prunes .
ask him what he' s got .
go on , ask him .

what' s for breakfast ?
some kind of breads and fruits .
i' il be right there .
rick , pull up a chair , sit down .
i' il share my prunes and then you can tell me all about this .
don' t take the chain off the door .
rattle it like you' il take it off .
make him think you' il take it off .
you mean like this ?
is that good ?
yeah .
it' s funny to you .
oh , god !
get the mace !
you get it !
the mace !
the mace !
hurry up !
come on !
upstairs !
wait a minute !
get my purse .
hurry up !
i can' t do this , rick .
what are you talking about ?
this is what lee lacocca does .
i' m very scared , rick .
since when did you start wearing underpants ?
do i get to know what' s going on or do i get killed for old time' s sake ?
follow me .
i' ve got to know what' s going on .
so do i.
i' m supposedly being protected by the federal government ... ... but i think they' re trying to do me in .
who are those men ?
ex drug enforcement agents .
i sent one to jail and could send the other .
they want me and whoever' s with me .
why ?
i testified against them .
that' s why .
about what ?
it' s a long story .
this is not a good time to talk about this .
help !
my god !
is that the vlp entrance ?
good morning .
how are we doing today ?
i' m so hungry !
we got to get out of this room .
it' s too dangerous to go to the room .
i' ve gotta change my clothes .
no !
we' il buy some , okay ?
if this isn' t a dream , i' m in deep shit .
you owe me an explanation .
get me out , i' il tell you everything .
no .
don' t tell me .
no keys .
gotcha !
i ought to weenie whip you !
get that weenie out of my face !
let' s get outta here .
how you doing over there ?
great .
tell me the story .
remember when jamie and i got everybody to chip in ... ... so we could go south and score some real acapulco gold ?
i remember you borrowed his father' s plane so you could fly to mexicali .
that' s the last i ever heard from you .
it seemed simple .
fly south , pick up a couple of keys .
but no , we were really impressed with ourselves .
we started drinking , shooting off at the mouth ... ... and before we knew it there was this guy called sorenson involved .
things just got a whole lot bigger .
what a dumb ass thing to do .
you always did love being a big shot .
you don' t understand .
i understand .
you were being a couple of jerks like always .
anything for a kick .
anything to thumb your nose at authority .
your gold card .
where do you get off with that attitude ?
rick jarmin , asshole .
whatever happened to you ?
i got smart .
is that what you call being corrupted ?
smart ?
you know nothing about me .
i got your number , baby .
we got a blue beemer .
you' re totally unchanged .
i' ve never met anybody more holier than thou .
tell me something honestly .
do you ever donate anything to the poor ?
or do you and jerry the napalm king hoard your millions ?
laundry detergent !
yeah , we had it wrong .
yes .
we' re very rich and we hoard our millions .
occasionally we invite a poor person in for thanksgiving .
feed him nothing .
we eat turkey in front of him and watch him starve .
can i drop you somewhere ?
yeah .
wisconsin .
wisconsin ?
yeah .
racine , wisconsin .
i' ve got to find lou baird .
he' s the one i can trust to get me back into hiding .
what' s he doing in wisconsin ?
he' s not .
he' s in st. louis .
i' m with rick jarmin again .
the hand is quicker than the eye .
my address book is in wisconsin .
his sister is there , and i think that' s where he retired .
i don' t think you' re in any witness relocation program .
you' re some two bit criminal being chased by the police .
you don' t mean that .
or you can' t pay your gambling debts .
you dressed it up with this fbi crap .
wisconsin is only six hours away .
i have a life .
but are you happy ?
i' m expected home .
hands on the dashboard .
don' t move .
get that gun out of my face .
you have the right to an attorney .
i am an attorney , damn it !
are you billy ray bowers ?
what' s he charged with ?
you' re both charged with the killing of marvin marsent .
you were identified at the scene of the crime .
rick , tell them .
what ?
about the witness relocation program .
you' il have time to tell us in jail .
put both hands behind your head .
drive !
get in the car !
shut up and steer the damn thing !
did you kill the guy ?
no , i loved him .
they killed him .
then you can plead innocent !
i never will .
they' il kill me before i get a chance .
the same goes for you .
get your foot off !
shit !
oh , god !
you' re gonna break my legs !
stop squealing !
watch where you' re going .
go north as soon as you can .
get your face off my gas !
shit !
this can' t be good for you .
what are you doing ?
i' m taking your place .
move over .
this is a rented car .
we can get in trouble if you drive it .
you' re worried about hertz ?
move !
give me my wheel !
you' il get us both killed .
move over !
jesus !
i think we lost them .
where are we ?
they' re not there anymore .
we' re in the railway tunnel .
where the hell are we ?
shit !
back up !
i don' t know .
stuck .
goddamn !
what are you doing ?
you almost got us killed !
i did you a favor .
are you having fun or something ?
i can' t believe when you pulled ...
you were great back there .
i was so scared !
you' il love it in racine .
it' s a happening town .
the car was rented by marianne graves , a lawyer from new york .
how she got involved , i don' t know , but i don' t like it .
call it kidnapping .
he' il kill her the same way he killed his boss at the gas station .
i don' t like all this killing .
erasing a witness ...
you' re not trying to back out on us , are you ?
not a good idea , joe .
please don' t smoke .
we would hate to inform authorities that 20 years ago you were responsible ... ... for selling confiscated narcotics out of the back door of the police warehouse .
yeah , joe .
especially now that you' ve got yourself such a big career .
relax .
i' m doing everything i can .
i' ve used the kidnapping to bring the fbi in .
we' re plugged into the woman' s phone lines , credit cards , bank account .
auto club .
they' re bound to surface .
when they do , jarmin will either be shot or wind up in prison .
then he' s yours .
we' re looking forward to that , joe .
what a pro .
hundreds !
that' s all you carry .
where are we now ?
shortcut .
what' s the matter ?
nothing .
i never told you , jamie' s dead .
god !
he was killed by sorenson and diggs .
they were two drug enforcement agents , corrupt ones .
they busted jamie and me for the nickel bags we bought ... ... and told us we' d rot injail if we didn' t do exactly what they said .
one minute we were kids ... ... and the next we were trapped in the middle of a major drug deal .
they needed our plane .
they made us fly under the radar to an unmarked airstrip on the us side ... ... and that' s where all hell broke loose .
diggs and sorenson must' ve been under government surveillance ... ... ' cause there were a lot of cops waiting for us when we landed .
sorenson came out shooting .
he killed one of the border patrol guys .
he wounded another one .
diggs , however , got away .
me and jamie figured we could bring sorenson down ... ... before he killed anybody else .
we were wrong .
jamie got it point blank in the chest .
i spent three months in a mexicali jail ... ... before the fbi finally offered me immunity ... ... for testifying against diggs and sorenson .
that' s when i joined the witness relocation program .
it' s been fun ever since .
why didn' t you call me ?
i didn' t want to get you involved .
you were about to march up to the altar anyway , so i let it lie .
this is it ?
i think this is it .
it' s all changed around .
yeah , this is it .
it better be here or i' m in deep shit .
i' m going to look for a bathroom .
have any change so i can get to the va hospital ?
hold up .
be right with you , pal .
what do you need ?
what' ve you got ?
what are you doing ?
that' s all you' ve got .
here , brother .
have three squares on me .
this all you' ve got ?
how dare you do a thing like that !
the guy' s hungry .
that' s for me to decide !
that' s my money !
you' ve got plenty .
what' s the problem ?
i worked hard for it , damn it !
you couldn' t carry something smaller ?
why do you carry hundreds ?
status ?
no !
emergency .
this was an emergency .
but it wasn' t my emergency .
it' s that attitude that keeps half the people in this world starving .
i don' t see you feeding the poor !
what did you just see ?
you' re such a jackass !
am i ?
mattie ?
mattie carlson ?
my god !
mattie ?
i' ve got to talk to you .
when i left my job here , i owed this guy a lot of money .
hi .
you won' t believe who' s here !
it' s mad mattie carlson !
can you wait in the car ?
could get ugly .
don' t tell me .
i must talk to you .
you were a hairdresser ?
you don' t get a lot of choice in the relocation game .
i can' t believe it !
raun is gonna shit !
he' s gonna die !
i can' t believe it !
can' t say hi to an old friend ?
cat got your tongue ?

this is my sister .
hi .

let' s go see raun .
he' s dying to see you !
i' il bet he is .
your brother is a genius !
michelangelo of hair .
i' m not exaggerating !
we lost half our clientele when he left .
he left on his lunch break .
can you believe it ?
bread and butter !
silly girl .
he always does my hair .
are you coming back ?
you' il have to pay raun what you owe him .
raun , look who' s back .
hi , raun .
hello , matthew .
i' il bet you' re surprised to see me .
you' ve lost weight .
your hair !
you look 10 years younger !
cut the crap .
you' ve been a bad boy .
i know .
mea culpa .
and sic semper tyrannis .
you' re so right .
but i' ve come to pay you back what i owe you .
will wonders never cease ?
you still have my things , my address ...
show me cash , i' il show you the book .
could you hang on a minute ?
this is funny to you ?
yes .
i need $2, 000 cash .
isn' t it nice one of us became a materialistic being ?
can you help me , please ?
what' s in it for me ?
if i get the book , i can get to lou baird and pay you back quicker .
if i don' t get the book , you might be stuck with me .
how' s that ?
who do i make the check out to ?
i' m supposed to believe your check is good ?
i want cash !
the bank' s over there .

i' m gonna go on the road and hitchhike .
i don' t care if they catch us and we die .
i need food .
i need a bath .

i need a massage .
i need a manicure .
i need to see my therapist .

i' il talk to the guy in charge .

i don' t care .

tomorrow at 7 : 30 , before you know it .
thanks , norman .
good night .
hiya , pooch .
marianne , are you in this one ?
there' s no lock and no door handle .
watch the door .
it falls of the hinges .
why didn' t you choose another one ?
the guy said , " take your pick .
the only one with a tv .
so there is .
civilization .
i wonder if we' re on the news .
shit !
there was nothing good on anyway .
i' ve just taken a shower .
i' m wearing a towel .
i' m hanging up my clothes .
this is interesting narration .
i' d appreciate your not watching me .
there' s nothing else to watch .
speaking of watches , i' ve still got yours .
i didn' t give it to the guy .
we' il need it tomorrow anyway .
we' il have to get a car or something .
lou baird said he wants to see me in person .
i was talking to his sister .
i tried to tell her the problem .
but she said it wasn' t a good idea to discuss it on the phone .
why ?
i don' t know .
was the phone tapped or something ?
god .
i knew you' d say that .
i hope not .
don' t go there .
call the police .
you know i can' t do that .
why are you so paranoid about the police ?
they can help you .
i' m half a day' s drive away from lou baird' s .
i' m not going ...
how do you know he' s not part of the setup ?
because he isn' t .
he' s saved my hide too many times to want to kill me now .
tomorrow morning , we' il find the nearest town ... ... swap your watch for some old junker , and everything will be just fine .
i know what i' m doing .
have you got a towel ?
that' s not a towel .
who' s gonna pay for this hotel room ?
they need a chambermaid .
a chambermaid ?
i' il help you .
it' s only 12 units .
it won' t take us very long .
are you mumbling ?
what are you doing ?
good luck .
i' m out of here in the morning .
i gave this guy my word .
i didn' t , all right ?
i' il call my office in the morning ... ... have them express mail some money , pay the guy off .
i' il buy this goddamn place , if necessary , and i' m out of here .
calm down .
what' s eating you ?
calm down ?
i just took a shower with a cockroach from hell .
he' s doing his hair now .
not to mention that you' ve sold me into human bondage .
you really are spoiled .
yes , i am .
then being a chambermaid might do you some good .
god !
stop that shit .
what shit ?
that mumbling has always driven me crazy .
did you ever wonder why we got together in the first place ?
do we ever agree on anything ?
did your personality ever not annoy me ?
sex .
sex .
i really don' t remember .
you really don' t ?
i don' t think you do either .
i think this is a cheap trick ' cause i' m getting into bed with you .
i wouldn' t worry about me .
anyway , i have a boyfriend .
a very wonderful boyfriend .
who' s this boyfriend ?
how' d i know you' d ask me that ?
why shouldn' t i ?
you' il just belittle him .
i would not .
you will .
i know you .
have it your way .
please stay above the covers .
why ?
my towel is wet .
i have to get out of it .
i guess so .
that' s better .
thank you .
tell me about this boyfriend .
what' s he like in the sack ?
can he thrill the lake ?
i' m not discussing sex with you tonight .
i haven' t had a girlfriend in five years .
really ?
yeah .
mr. wiggly' s been on bread and water for five long years .
is that the truth ?
yeah .
i didn' t think it would be fair .
you cold ?
not really .
feels familiar , doesn' t it ?
thought you said you didn' t remember .
i feel kind of selfish under here .
you are very selfish , and not just under there .
too bad you said that .
why ?
i was actually beginning to get turned on .
too bad for you .
i wasn' t .
you weren' t ?
no .
fine .
stop that , will you ?
if you do that again ...
you can' t tell me what to do , okay ?
i can' t help it .
what are you gonna do , add another felony to your list of crimes ?
go to sleep .
i can' t .
what' s the name of this boyfriend ?
tell me .
i' il be nice .
you will ?
okay .
his name is paul .
sounds like a dipshit .
anyone named paul is probably a spot welder .
shut up .
go to sleep .
is that true ?
what ?
about five years ?
thought you didn' t want to discuss it .
i don' t .
then shut up .
shut up ?
yeah , i' il shut up .
god .
let me look at you .
i missed you .
god , i missed you .
doesn' t this feel right ?
i had that dream again .
remember the dream i used to have after we made love ?
the one about the seven dwarfs ?
remember the dream , we were in the middle of the ocean ... ... and it was that really big sailboat ?
yeah .
we were alone .
there was nobody around .
it was just us .
that' s a nice dream .
can' t we do that ?
can' t we find a way ?
i' ve spent 15 years looking for it .
if i could' ve found it , i' d have come and got you , married or not .
would you really ?
yeah .
but there' s nothing we can do now .
we gotta get out of here .
i' m gonna see what kind of car i can get with that watch of yours .
there must be a way .
yeah ?
paul ?
marianne .
no , i' m fine .
i' m really all right .
i can' t talk .
i' m fine .
i just need you to help us .
i need you to call someone .
please .
yes , damn it !
i don' t have enough time .
marianne , your chariot awaits you .
just do it !
i gotta go .
where are you hiding ?
better pick it up , hot legs .
we gotta go .
hi .
you found me .
wait till you see what i got for you .
bring it on out here .
there' s your watch .
what a beauty .
you think so ?
fine piece of equipment .
look at this little jewel here .
i had to grind him down , but he finally accepted my terms .
hello .
extension 2200 , please .
hello ?
yes , mr. bernhardt .
of course i remember you .
they' re headed where ?
she wants federal marshals and some members of the press there .
you did the right thing by calling me .
i can take care of all that .
no , you wait by the phone .
we' il make sure she' s safe .
you don' t have to worry .
you bet .
thank you .
all right .
end of the line .
jesus , we' re overheating .
we' re lucky to get here at all .
hang on .
wait for me .
the lights are on , so i guess there must be somebody in there .
lou .
it' s me , rick .
in a minute .
stubborn old guy , isn' t he ?
you mind if we come in ?
i' il see you at the front door .
lou .
yes ?
it' s me , rick jarmin .
my lord .
so it is .
jeez , lou .
come on in .
hi .
this is marianne graves .
how do you do ?
you scared the hell out of me .
i thought you forgot who i was .
i damn near did .
i' d be in big trouble then , ' cause i' m in a spot ... ... and you' re about the only guy in the world who can help me out .
where do i start ?
they finally let sorenson out of the cage .
he and diggs are after us , and they seem to know every move we' re making .
i think somebody at the bureau is doing us in .
i work at the zoo .
i' ve got connections there .
you placed me there , remember ?
it' s just down the block .
i can find it every time , even in the dark .
molly likes it that way .
are you monty ?
i' m sorry .
i didn' t hear the bell .
are you the young man who was calling ?
i told you i didn' t think he' d remember .
that' s why i thought you should come here .
sometimes it helps if he sees a face .
ma' am , do you know who that is ?
those are federal marshals .
i called them .
i thought this was a setup .
even if it isn' t a setup , you have to talk to them .
you can' t keep running ...
you' re right about one thing .
there' s nowhere else to run .
you have a basement here ?
it' s off the kitchen .
can you show it to me ?
what have i done ?
i' m sorry .
it' s designed as a bomb shelter .
no one can get in here .
go and lock yourselves in .
don' t come out till it' s quiet .
where are you going , rick ?
i don' t know , lou .
how about the zoo ?
they got guns there .
you know every inch of the way .
that' s a good idea .
zoo .
hello ?
hurry up !
you got nothing to fear .
joe weyburn .
aren' t those guys gonna follow us ?
damn well better .
they' ve changed the code .
not now !
how did you ... ?
i can' t believe i did that .
come on .
wait .
you didn' t see us , bob , okay ?
that' s gotta be them .
be careful .
stationery .
where is it ?
where do they put these things ?
they used to have real guns here .
what' s that ?
that' s a tranquilizer gun .
i' m sorry .
i' m sorry i did this to you .
i called them on you .
that' s all right .
i should be apologizing to you .
it' s probably for the best .
fifteen years is long enough .
yeah , it is .
lock the doors and stay in here no matter what you see .
don' t come out .
just stay in here .
if you see me do this , i want you to hit this button .
see what it does ?
see those lights there ?
it turns them on .
just like that , okay ?
keep your head down .
please live through this .
i can' t go to another one of your funerals .
you remember , you stay in here .
' cause it' s a zoo out there .
which one did he say ?
rick ?
it' s joe weyburn .
we don' t mean you any harm .
we just want to talk .
welcome to the tropical rain forest .
we have assembled a collection of flora and fauna ... ... indigenous to both the south american rain forest and the african savannah .

i could marry you .
you liar .
you wouldn' t marry me .

rick , look at me .
