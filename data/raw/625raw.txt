trick or treat .
well , look at this .
all the superheroes on our porch .
ain' t that cute ?
we got superman here , and batman ... and his sidekick robin .
the green lantern .
and what about you , young man ?
what about what ?
who are you supposed to be ?
i' m harvey pekar .
pecker .
harvey pekar ?
that doesn' t sound like a superhero to me .
i ain' t no superhero , lady .
i' m just a kid from the neighborhood , all right ?
forget this !
why does everybody have to be so stupid ?
okay , this guy here , he' s our man .
okay , this guy here , he' s our man .
all grown up and going nowhere .
always a pretty scholarly cat .
he never got much of a formal education .
for the most part , he' s lived in shit neighborhoods , held shit jobs ... and is now knee deep into a disastrous second marriage .
so if you' re the kind of person looking for romance or escapism ... or some fantasy figure to save the day , guess what ?
you got the wrong movie .
that' s great .
so now you got four takes .
you ought to be able to patch one together from there .
right ?
let' s go to the next one , all right ?
hold on a second .
do you want some water or something ?
no , i got lots of orange .
do you like orange soda ?
yeah , orange is all right .
all right , let' s go to the next sequence .
did you actually read the script ?
no .
a little bit .
just to check the construction .
you know , how the piece was constructed .
i didn' t read it word for word .
do you feel weird saying this stuff ?
no , i don' t feel weird saying it .
i don' t know how long my voice is going to hold out .
doc , you gotta help me , man .
my old lady' s dumping me ' cause i can' t talk .
she says i' m a social embarrassment .
now that she' s got a phd , she' s some hot shit academic star ... and i' m nothing but a file clerk .
me being a file clerk was fine when i was signing the damn checks for tuition .
harvey , stop talking , please , and open wide .
i started worrying my voice would never come back .
say " aah , " mr. pekar .
it' s torture , i' m telling you .
what ?
is it bad , doc ?
it' s not good .
it' s cancer .
first i got marital problems , and now you' re telling me i got throat cancer .
for christ' s sake , man .
harvey , calm down , it' s not cancer .
you have a nodule on your vocal cords , probably from screaming and yelling .
if you don' t give it a rest , you' re gonna lose your voice completely .
okay .
but for how long ?
a few months .
months ?
hey , come on , what is this ?
exactly what it looks like .
what do you mean ?
you mean you' re dumping me ?
for what ?
this plebeian lifestyle ... just isn' t working for me anymore , okay ?
i gotta get out of here before i kill myself .
just listen to what i have to say , okay ?
don' t go .
i need you , baby .
please don' t go , okay ?
here' s our man .
yeah , all right , here' s me .
or the guy playing me anyway , though he don' t look nothing like me .
but whatever .
so it' s a few months later , and i' m working my flunky file clerk gig at the va hospital .
my voice still ain' t back yet .
thank you , harvey , dear .
things seem like they can' t get any worse .
plebeian " ?
where the hell did she get that shit , man ?
avoid the reeking herd
shun the polluted flock
live like that stoic bird
the eagle of the rock
hey , mr. boats .
you know what that means , son ?
yeah , it' s from an elinor hoyt wylie poem .
it means ...
excuse me .
it means stay away from the crowds of common , ordinary people ...
and do your own thing .
no .
it means don' t compromise yourself for women .
it ain' t gonna do you no good .
get away from them as soon as you can .
i ain' t got no woman now .
i' m living like the stoic bird , man .
it' s the only way to live , son .
look at that fool there .
probably listening to that loud rock stuff .
junk , it' s all junk .
i don' t know .
i mean ... rock music' s got some good qualities .
it isn' t jazz or nothing , but you know ...
say , when are you gonna bring me in some of those good records ?
some nat king cole with strings .
i don' t got any of that , mr. boats .
yeah , you got that .
you' re keeping them at home , though .
you won' t turn loose the good stuff .
you just sell the junk .
i keep the stuff i wanna keep .
i sold a lot of good material by people that he didn' t like .
mr. boats didn' t like any blues or anything like that .
he played classical violin .
i started record collecting when i was 15 or 16 years old .
i started getting interested in jazz .
prior to that , i collected comic books .
i was always a collector .
i admit to having an obsessive compulsive quality in me .
it' s like the treasure of the sierra madre or something .
you go to thrift shops and you go to the garage sales ... because you think you' re gonna find something that' s real rare .
and most of time , it' s a total waste of time , but once in a while ... you' il come up with something that' il whet your appetite .
in the early ' 60s ...
i was with some buddies at a junk sale , looking for some choice sides ... when i met this shy , retiring cat from philadelphia named bob crumb .
you know the guy .
fritz the cat , mr. natural and all .
they made a movie about him , too .
jay mcshann .
come on , harv , you gonna buy that , or what ?
i don' t know , marty , it' s got a lamination crack .
a quarter .
maybe i could talk it down .
you are one cheap bastard , harvey .
i know i' m tight , man .
i live on a government wage .
you collect jay mcshann , man ?
yeah , man , how about you ?
yeah .
but most of my records are back in philly .
harvey , meet my buddy , bob crumb .
he just moved to town .
he' s an artist with the american greeting card company .
you should see his comics , harv .
they' re out of sight .
i' m into comics myself .
so crumb showed me this comic book novel he was working on .
big yum yum book .
i' d never seen anything like it .
this is terrific .
i really dig your work , man .
this peter wheat book is by walt kelly .
it' s pretty rare .
yeah ?
can i get good bread for it ?
not yet .
let' s get back to your book .
what are you gonna do with it ?
i haven' t really thought about it .
it' s just an exercise .
no , man .
it' s more than just an exercise .
it' s breaking ground , man .
there' s some wild shit in here , bob .
you' re spitting on me , harvey .
crumb and i hung out a lot back then .
we had records and comics in common .
check it out , man .
pretty scary .
you don' t know the half of it , man .
eventually , people got hip to crumb' s artwork ... and he started hanging out with the bohemian crowd .
after a while , he got sick of greeting cards and moved away to san francisco ... where he got the whole underground comic scene off the ground .
he' d come back to cleveland every few years ... and people would treat him like a celebrity .
once , he came to visit when i was feeling real bad .
it was right after my wife left me .
she got so mean to me at the end ...
like i tried to keep her captive or anything like that .
i don' t know , man .
but don' t think i' m buying any of this growth crap , man .
everybody' s always talking about how bad experiences cause you to grow ... and all that cliched stuff .
man , i got enough bad experiences and growth to last me plenty .
right now ...
i' d be glad to trade some growth for happiness .
how long you staying in cleveland , man ?
i don' t know , i got to see this chick in new york ... and i' m really busy with the comic book stuff .
it' s good bread and all .
i' m just getting sick of the whole scene .
what are you talking about ?
you make a good living doing your art , right ?
how many guys get that lucky in their life ?
listen , i' il tell you something .
people are starting to know the name crumb .
when you croak , man , you' re gonna leave something behind .
yeah , i guess .
it' s not like i' m blind lemon jefferson , or big mama thornton .
come on , man .
i tell you something , it sure beats working a gig like mine ... being a nobody flunky and selling records on the side for $1 .
well , that' s true .
listen , girlie ... these glasses are six for $2 because i couldn' t carry 12 .
but i wanted 12 .
so today , i' m buying six more .
but you should only charge me $1 . 50 for them .
it' s all right .
you can ask the manager .
frank , i need a price check .
man , old jewish ladies will argue forever with a cashier about anything .
these glasses ...
you get behind them in line and you' re gonna wait forever . ... because i couldn' t carry 12 .
so today ...
i' m a yid myself ... and women in my family are like that , but i never got used to it .
i mean , i may be cheap , but i got limits , man .
let me explain one more time .
these glasses are six for $2 ...
wake up !
your whole life' s getting eaten away with this kind of crap .
what kind of existence is this ?
is this all a working stiff like you can expect ?
you gonna suffer in silence for the rest of your life , or are you gonna make a mark ?
okay , i have the money right here .
even money , $1 . 50 .
you don' t even have to open the cash register .
even change .
and , dear ...
oh , shit !
ever since i read your stuff , man , i' ve been thinking ...
i can write comic book stories ... that are different from anything that' s been done .
i figure the guys who are doing animal comics ... and superhero stuff , they' re really limited .
because they got to try to appeal to kids .
and underground stuff like yours has been really subversive ... and it' s opened things up politically ... but there' s still plenty more to be done with them , too .
pass the ketchup .
the words , the pictures , they could be more of an art form .
you know , like those french movies ... or de sica over in italy .
so , anyway , i tried ...
i tried writing some stuff about real life ... stuff that the everyman' s got to deal with .
these are all about you ?
yeah .
you' ve turned yourself into a comic hero .
sort of , but there' s no idealized shit .
there' s no phony bullshit .
this is the real thing , man .
you know , ordinary life is pretty complex stuff .
these are really ... good .
really , you think so ?
yeah , this is great stuff .
i dig it .
can i take them home and illustrate them ?
you' d really do that for me , man ?
that would be great because i can' t even draw a straight line , bob .
what' s up with your voice , harv ?
all of a sudden , you sound fine .
i don' t know , man .
i guess you cured me .
that bonnie , her legs go forever .
how smart is she ?
i don' t know .
i guess she' s about average .
average ?
hey , man , average is dumb .
so what if she' s dumb ?
i don' t care .
hey , man , average is dumb .
fuck that .
that' s all stories by yours truly .
hot off the presses ?
that' s right .
we have a regular hemingway here .
no way , i don' t go in for any of that macho crap .
i didn' t know you could draw .
no , i don' t draw , doc .
i write the stories .
harvey , am i in here ?
you' re in there , all right ?
take it easy .
a buddy of mine and some of his friends do the art work .
let me see this .
mr. boats , it' s not polite to grab things .
next time ...
it' s not bad .
son , you done good .
but you know , i was up in toronto a few weeks back .
i saw the red chinese ballet .
now , that was beautiful .
the way those people were dancing together ... those chinese , they work hard , i tell you .
where' s everybody going ?
where are you sick men rushing off to ?
you ain' t going nowhere for now .
probably not for a long time .
but damn if they' re not a rushing off to get there .
harvey , how do your co workers and friends feel about you putting them in your comics ?
they love it .
they can' t get enough of it .
they come up to me demanding to know why i' m not in the new issue .
most of them .
what about overhearing what people say ?
are you always listening at work ?
were you listening riding the bus ?
the supermarket ?
yeah , i listen .
i fall asleep on people , too , but i listen some .
here' s our man , eight comics later .
a brand new decade , same old bullshit .
sure , he gets lots of recognition for his writing now .
his comics are praised by all the important media types telling people what to think .
but so what ?
it' s not like he makes a living at it , like bob crumb .
he can' t go and quit his day job or nothing .
who am i kidding ?
truth is , i' d be lost without my work routine .
i got a job .
hi , harvey .
do you want these gourmet jelly beans ?
i gave up sweets for lent .
yeah , sure , i' il take them .
i recommend the pina coladas .
they' re excellent and very authentic tasting .
it' s watermelon .
that' s pretty good .
wait till you try the pina coladas .
tell me something .
can you eat lentils during lent ?
sure , i don' t see why not .
you can' t eat meat on certain days ... but lentils should be acceptable anytime .
do you think there' s any connection between lentils and lent ?
i don' t think so .
but i' il ask sister mary fred at church on sunday .
sister mary fred , huh ?
is she cute ?
she sounds kind of mannish , but who the hell am i to be picky ?
you' re funny .
she' s a nun .
so what ?
maybe she became a nun because she couldn' t get a guy .
she became a nun because she had a higher calling .
higher calling ?
what a crock of shit .
i don' t even know why you bother praying anyway .
i enjoy the ritual , and i' m a very spiritual person .
you know , you should try believing in something bigger than yourself .
it might cheer you up .
what , do i seem depressed ?
cut !
that was great , guys .
the bakery scene' s next .
the bakery scene' s next ?
i didn' t know of a bakery scene .
did you ever hear of a bakery scene ?
bakery is my scene , but not in that way .
forget the bakery , let' s eat some jelly beans .
i think one might be lime .
one might be mint .
what' s the difference between this and this ?
one' s cherry , one' s cinnamon .
you could tell that by just looking at them ?
not me .
i have to put it in my mouth first .
loneliness can feel so bad .
there have been times i' ve felt lonely ...
' cause a lot of the time , it was just me and my grandmother .
i' d just be sitting in my room all day ... watching television or reading books .
that was before i bought a computer , of course .
how do you cope with loneliness , harvey ?
did i say i watched television ?
you mentioned you watch tv ... you listen to your jazz records , you read ... you write , you drew your stick figures ... so you could plan for your next comic book .
i' ve seen many of your stick figures .
that seems to be pretty interesting .
chocolate jelly beans , i' m gonna try one .
go ahead .
excuse me , can i help you ?
give me ... two crullers ... jelly doughnut with the powdered sugar .
thanks for coming .
you got any of that day old bread ?
i think so .
here you go .
$3 .
you' re harvey pekar ?
alice quinn , from school .
college , yeah .
we had a couple of lit classes together .
what happened to you ?
you disappeared after two semesters .
yeah , i know .
i got good grades and all , but there was that required math class ... hanging over my head .
eventually , the pressure got to be too much , so ...
you' re doing okay , anyway .
i heard all about your jazz reviews and your comics .
you did ?
sure , you' re famous .
meanwhile , i got my degree and i' m just a plain old wife and mother .
i' m not doing as great as you think .
my second wife divorced me , i work a dead end job ... as a file clerk .
sometimes i hang out with the guys on the corner ... but most of the time i just stay at home by myself and i read .
you' re luckier than you think .
between my husband and my kids ... it' s impossible for me to curl up with a good book .
i' m reading this book by dreiser now .
jennie gerhardt .
that' s one of my favorites .
yeah ?
i hope that book don' t end like so many of those naturalist novels ... with someone getting crushed to earth ... by forces he can' t control .
i think you' il be pleasantly surprised .
i mean , it' s certainly not your hollywood happy ending ... but it' s pretty truthful , which is rare these days .
this is me .
all right .
nice car .
thanks .
i don' t have one yet .
can i give you a lift somewhere ?
no , that' s all right .
it' s a nice day , i' il just walk .
it was nice seeing you .
when i got home , i finished reading jennie gerhardt .
it was real good .
that alice was right .
sure , lester , the main character , croaks in the end ... but at least he' s old and dies a natural , dignified death .
i was more alone that weekend than any .
sometimes in my sleep , i' d feel a body next to me ...
like an amputee feels a phantom limb .
all i did was think about jennie gerhardt and alice quinn ... and all the decades of people i had known .
the more i thought , the more i felt like crying .
life seemed so sweet and so sad ... and so hard to let go of in the end .
but hey , man , every day is a brand new deal , right ?
just keep on working and something' s bound to turn up .
what happened to the new american splendor ?
i think we sold them , babe .
all of them ?
yeah .
rand , i put one aside for myself next to the register .
i haven' t even had time to read it yet .
sorry , joyce , i didn' t know you were such a splendor fan .
next time , take it home .
maybe i' il call the publisher .
it' il take so damn long .
shit !
why does everything in my life have to be such a complicated disaster ?
okay , maybe we can call someone ...
what is this ?
all right .
okay .
i' m gonna hustle before the vibe in here gets any worse .
you can just hang .
dear mr. pekar ...
greetings from the second smallest state in the union ...
an endless plastics and nylon plantation ...
controlled by giant chemical corporations .
to make matters more dismal , there are no decent comic book stores in my town ...
which is why my partner and i opened one ourselves .
despite our steadily faltering business ...
my partner managed to sell the last copy of american splendor number 8 ...
out from under me .
i' m a big fan , and i hate to wait for a new order .
is there any way i can get it from you direct ?
sincerely , joyce brabner .
she' s got good looking handwriting .
dear joyce , thanks for the ...
dear joyce , thanks for the letter .
what do you do besides selling comics ?
anybody in the room ever done any creative writing of any sort ?
i' m a sometime activist , and i teach writing to prisoners .
i try to help them build an interior life ...
and make art out of their monotonous , suffocating routine .
this sounds familiar .
so you married or what ?
i' m divorced , thank god .
look , i think you and i got a lot in common , you know ?
how am i gonna get you to come visit me in cleveland ?
cleveland ?
yeah .
you think that' s a good idea ?
it' s a great idea .
you should meet me because i' m a great guy .
despite the way my comics read ...
i got a lot of redeeming characteristics .
i don' t know .
where would i stay ?
i don' t know .
with me .
don' t worry .
i' m not gonna put no moves on you .
i' m not worried about that .
hold on , i just spilled my chamomile tea all over me .
so what are you worried about then ?
it' s the way all the different artists draw you .
what ?
i don' t really know what to expect .
sometimes you look like a younger brando .
but then , the way crumb draws you ... you look like a hairy ape , with all these ... wavy , stinky lines undulating off your body .
i don' t really know what to expect .
no , those are motion lines .
i' m an active guy .
look , just come out here ... and i will try to be anyone that you want me to be , okay ?
that' s a dangerous offer .
i' m a notorious reformer .
are you joyce ?
hey , harvey .
hey .
so we finally meet in person .
yeah .
look , before we get started with any of this , you might as well know i had a vasectomy .
what' s wrong ?
nothing .
something' s wrong .
you keep looking around everywhere .
i guess i never imagined you' d eat in a place like this .
what , me ?
no , i' ve never been here .
i thought you' d like it .
but obviously you don' t , do you ?
no , it' s fine .
what difference does it make ?
i don' t know .
none , i guess .
they got a lot of meat on this menu .
you' re a vegetarian ?
kind of , you know , i mean ...
ever since i got a pet cat ...
i' ve had a lot of trouble eating animals .
i support and identify with groups like peta ... but unfortunately , i' m a self diagnosed anemic .
also , i have all these food allergies to vegetables ... which give me serious intestinal distress .
i guess i have a lot of borderline health disorders ... that limit me politically when it comes to eating .
you' re a sick woman .
not yet , but i expect to be .
everyone in my family has some sort of degenerative illness .
good evening .
i was gonna clean up ... but why should i give you any false notions ?
the truth is , i got a serious problem with cleanliness .
if i had to wash a dish 10 times , it' d still be dirty .
they even kicked me out of the army ' cause i couldn' t learn to make a bed .
i' ve seen worse .
could you get me some water and a few aspirin ?
what , you got a headache ?
no , but i want to avoid one .
yeah .
let me tell you something .
sure is nice to have company .
you know , i mean ... despite all your problems , you seem like a great person .
i' m sorry if my dating skills are a little rusty .
it' s just that i' ve been through hell and back with women .
that last one turned out to be a real nasty bitch .
i had a nice time with you , too .
yeah ?
you had a nice time ?
don' t make people repeat themselves .
that' s annoying .
sorry .
come here .
which way is the bathroom ?
through the kitchen , on the right .
joyce , what' s wrong ?
what is it ?
i don' t know .
i think that yuppie food did me in .
i feel terrible .
let me at least do something for you .
can i make you something ?
how about some chamomile tea ?
chamomile tea ?
what' s a guy like you doing with that ?
i thought you drank soda pop for breakfast .
i just noticed you drank a lot of it when we started talking on the phone .
the girl at the food co op ... she picked me out all kinds of this herbal stuff .
one of these is good for stomach aches .
here .
grandma bear' s tummy mint or something , i think .
hey , are you still there ?
i think we should skip the whole courtship thing and just get married .
man , am i glad i talked you into coming up here .
you know , any more time alone , i really might have lost it .
me , too .
you don' t have any problems with moving to cleveland ?
not really .
i find most american cities to be depressing in the same way .
and you' re okay with the vasectomy thing ?
hey , toby .
no , you can' t have any of my white castle hamburger ... so please don' t even ask .
yeah ?
can i have a fry ?
okay , but just a couple , harvey .
i' m not going to be eating dinner until very late ... and this has got to hold me over .
what have you got , a church function ?
no , i' m driving to toledo to see a movie .
would you like to come ?
no , i gotta go to delaware tonight .
i' m getting married .
why delaware ?
the chick i' m marrying is from wilmington .
plus , i got to help her move her stuff back here .
why are you driving to toledo to see a movie ?
it' s not playing at the mapletown .
i didn' t know you had a girlfriend .
yeah , we met last week .
what movie could possibly be worth driving 260 miles roundtrip for ?
it' s a new film called revenge of the nerds .
it' s about a group of nerd college students ... who are being picked on all the time by the jocks .
so they decide to take revenge .
so what you' re saying is you identify with those nerds ?
yes , i consider myself a nerd ... and this movie has uplifted me .
there' s this one scene where a nerd grabs the microphone during a pep rally ... and announces that he is a nerd and that he is proud of it ... and stands up for the rights of other nerds .
right on .
then he asks all the kids at the pep rally ... who think they are nerds , to come forward .
so nearly everyone in the place does .
that' s the way the movie ends .
so the nerds won ?
yes .
all right .
you know , you got this movie , and i' m getting hitched .
we both had a good month .
right .
harvey ?
wait !
yeah ?
how long will you be in delaware ?
because i' d like to see this movie with you .
i don' t know .
i' m gonna be gone a week .
but then , i' m gonna have a wife .
so i' m going to have to bring her along , too .
is it a girl flick ?
depends on the girl .
what kind of girl is your new bride ?
is she a nerd ?
i don' t know , man .
maybe , yeah .
she' s into herbal tea .
i did end up becoming a character in his comics .
harvey tends to push the negative or the sour .
and he can be very depressed , and therefore very depressing .
harvey , do you think you portray joyce fairly ?
yeah , i think i portray her fairly .
there' s some things that she does that i don' t put in there ...
for obvious reasons .
i don' t wanna get my head cut off .
i think my portrayal is generally fairly accurate .
there' ve been stories that i' ve participated in ... or things that have happened , and i' ve seen them ... as a lot more happy things going on in there .
he just doesn' t put that in ... because he just doesn' t think that sunshine and flowers sell .
is that right ?
you always say , " misery loves company .
you know , i' m just a gloomy guy , that' s all .
gloom and doom .
and see , i thought i was marrying somebody with a sense of humor .
i guess i fooled you .
what a crock of shit , man .
that' s not the point .
you missed the whole point of the movie .
that' s not the point .
you missed the whole point of the movie .
where the hell am i supposed to find the point in garbage ?
i agree with toby .
i think it' s a story of hope and tolerance .
yes , it' s about time that the people who get picked on get to be the heroes .
it' s an entertaining flick and all , and i can see why you like it , toby .
but those people on the screen ain' t even supposed to be you .
they' re college students ... who live with their parents in big houses in the suburbs .
they' re gonna get degrees , get good jobs , and they' re gonna stop being nerds .
remember what i told you about loud talking ?
use your inside voice .
look , toby , the guys in that movie ... are not 28 year old file clerks who live with their grandmother ...
in an ethnic ghetto .
that' s enough .
they didn' t get their computers the way you did ... by trading in a bunch of box tops and $49 . 50 at the supermarket .
you' re funny , harvey .
i' m getting in the front .
sure , toby , fine .
you go to the movies and daydream ... but this revenge of the nerds ain' t reality .
it' s hollywood bullshit .
harvey , let him alone .
the thing that i loved about it is i was transported to another time in my life .
i like when they took the video cameras ...
lf everyone could see it ...
it' s the same as the " i have a dream " speech .
it' s very empowering .
maybe i was being so harsh on toby on account of my own problems .
you see , i wasn' t even married a month ... and my old lady was already showing signs of trouble .
granted , i tend to get married fast , ' cause i' il take any woman that' il have me .
but this time i really met my match .
how about these old 78s ?
can' t you sell them to one of your collectors ?
are you kidding me , man ?
no way .
i ain' t getting rid of my 78s .
forget it , then .
i give up .
how can i make more storage space if you won' t get rid of anything ?
you know what ?
i' il get rid of stuff .
just not my good stuff .
everything is your good stuff .
how am i supposed to live here if there' s no room for me ?
come on , baby .
i' il make room for you , okay ?
you just have to give me time .
i' m not so good at these things .

delusions of grandeur .
see , i think comics can pretty much be an art form , man .
i mean , the pictures can be as good as they want to be ... and the words can be as good as they want to be ... and a man can do pretty much anything he wants to .
that' s true , but i didn' t come all the way from delaware to talk about comics .
where is my american splendor in a world that' s cloudy and gray ?
where life keeps passing by me day by day
where is my american splendor in a world that' s cloudy and gray ?
where life keeps passing by me day by day
if you think reading comics about your life seems strange ... try watching a play about it .
god only knows how i' il feel when i see this movie .
things were going pretty good for a change .
variety called me " the blue collar mark twain .
doubleday was interested in publishing an anthology of american splendor .
i hate checking bags , man .
it always takes forever .

you know , vasectomies are reversible .
goddamn yuppies get everything , man .
are you listening to me ?
i said vasectomies are reversible .

what are you talking about ?
i don' t want no kids .
and i came clean about my vasectomy the first time i set eyes on you .
i know , but i think things have changed .
i think we can be a family .
family ?
right .
what kind of family could we possibly be ?
i ain' t no good with kids .
christ , i can barely take care of myself .
i can take care of the kid and you .
no way , joyce .
forget it .
i can' t have no kids .
i can' t do it .
where the hell is that ornette coleman album ?
you know , i got a review due tomorrow .

i' m not telling you what to do .
i' m the one who moved into your city , into your home ... into your vasectomy ... into your whole screwed up life .
the least you could do is allow me to live here in my own way .
i tried everything ... but nothing could get this woman out of bed .
i mean , she wouldn' t get a job , wouldn' t go out ... wouldn' t make friends , nothing .
joyce diagnosed herself as clinically depressed .
i didn' t know what the hell she was going through ... but it was sure taking its toll on me .

our next guest tonight works as a file clerk at a cleveland hospital .
he also writes comic books which deal with his day to day pains and pleasures .
this is an anthology of the nine of those comics .
it' s entitled american splendor .
from off the streets of cleveland , folks , please say hello to harvey pekar .
harvey , come out here .
hi , harvey .
thanks for coming out here .
have a seat .
what do you mean calling me " curious " ?
i met you before the show .
i meant " curious " in a fascinating way .
all right .
a man who has the presence of one who is quite fascinating .
' cause i met you before the show .
i thought you were a pretty nice guy .
i thought , wait a minute , i might be nursing a viper in my bosom .
something like that .
you' re a little defensive about this ?
yeah , i' m waiting for those cleveland jokes .
go ahead .
all right , settle down .
yeah , all right .
let' s explain to folks who may not be familiar with your work ... what it is you do here exactly .
you have comic books about you in your daily life .
and you also have a regular job in cleveland working at a hospital .
that' s right .
you know this guy ?
i' m beginning to wonder .
you could probably get by on what you make selling your work .
because people want you to write more , and you' re publishing this anthology .
who ?
what people ?
what are you talking about ?
where the hell do you get that stuff ?
i know that you ...
you know , that ...
i' m no show biz phony .
i' m telling the truth .
go on , man .
you can' t ...
at least he' s keeping up with letterman .
pandering is more like it .
you mean to tell me that other people haven' t contacted you for writing literary ...
i mean ...
you could making a living as a writer .
what are you trying to do over there ?
i' m trying to get some news .
there' s a big story about to break ... about the us selling arms to iran and the contras .
just relax .
don' t worry about it .
finally , something good .
watch this .
i got a job .
i know you' ve got a job .
i' ve got a job .
we' re both very lucky .
we both have jobs .
then what' s the matter ?
joke , man .
we gotta go .
harvey , i like you .
i' m on your side .
i enjoy the comic books .
quickly , tell us about the little doll .
my wife made it .
am i giving you a hard time ?
no .
am i making you nervous ?
no .
we have to go now .
i wanted to mention these are for sale .
they' re made out of your old clothing .
right .
what do these go for ? $34 .
$34 for this ?
what are you , cheaper than me ?
would you pay $34 for that ?
no , but i' m not asking it .
my wife is .
such brilliant repartee .
shit .
so , what do you think ?
megalomaniac .
hi , this is a message for harvey pekar .
from the streets of cleveland , ladies and gentlemen , please welcome ... the one , the only harvey pekar .
harvey , come on out , buddy .
it became clear pretty fast that i was invited on the show just for laughs .
you look like a lot of guys you see sleeping on buses .
sorry .
it' s all right , dave , have a good time .
i know , we' re doing what we can .
it' s your world .
i' m just living in it .
but what the hell did i care ?
letterman was an okay guy .
let him take potshots at me .
so long as i got paid and got to plug my comics .
i think to myself , you look like every police artist sketch i' ve ever seen .
funny thing is ... something about me and letterman clicked for the viewers .
he kept wanting me back .
it was about a year ago , this month ...
that' s right .
no , last month .
a year ago , last month , you made your first appearance on the show .
what has happened to you since ?
not much , david .
it' s slow going .
i still have the same job .
but see , harvey , you' re the embodiment of the american dream .
and it wasn' t just me getting all the attention .
action .
are these free ?
as a result of my appearances on letterman ... my buddy toby radloff , landed a gig extolling the virtues of mtv .
watch where you' re going .
all right , you fucking yuppie freak .
who the fuck is this on my set ?
look at this , the man of the hour .
this is my new do for the mtv generation .
we came upon toby radloff while doing a story in cleveland last year ... on his friend , the comic artist harvey pekar .
toby' s a genuine nerd , and he doesn' t care if you have a problem with that .
hi , my name is toby radloff , a genuine nerd from cleveland , ohio .
and as you know , many hip people ... including a lot of college students , are going to be heading for spring break .
but i have decided to spend my own personal spring break ... right here in beautiful cleveland , ohio .
that day , i had an epiphany .
it seemed that real salt of the earth people , like toby and me ... were getting co opted by these huge corporations .
we were getting held up and ridiculed as losers in the system .
this is toby radloff , genuine spring break party nerd ... signing off .
what can i say ?
it was the ' 80s , man .
harvey , are you listening to me ?
i' ve been reading about these kids who grew up in these war zones .
you know , palestinians , israelis ...
el salvadorians , cambodians .
these kids are amazing ...
you' re that guy from the letterman show , right ?
yeah , that' s me .
that' s so excellent .
you and stupid pet tricks are a riot .
yeah ?
then how about you buy one of my comics , man ?
that' s the only reason i go on that dumb show , anyway .
right .
sure .
later , harvey pekar .
what an asshole !
i want to write a political comic book ... about these kids .
listen to me .
there' s a conference in jerusalem in a couple of weeks .
i' m gonna start by doing some interviews there .
wait a minute .
what are you talking about , jerusalem ?
lately i can barely drag you off the futon to go with me to the letterman show .
do you want to know why ?
because i don' t give a damn about the letterman show .
i want to do something important to me , something that matters .
you know i only go on the show for the extra bread .
maybe if you got your lazy ass up , and got yourself a job ...
i could do something that matters , too .
harvey , you' re yelling .
you ever think of that ?
don' t ...
i' m sorry .
joyce , i' m sorry .
i guess it was good to finally see joyce excited about something of her own .
this is crazy .
can' t you just do something here in cleveland ?
you' il survive a couple of weeks by yourself .
all right .
be careful out there , all right ?
i love you .
sure , i was happy for her , but i was still upset for me .
it was later that night when i first found the lump .
i was determined to put it out of my mind until joyce got back .
easier said than done .
what do i care ?
just give me the chart .
what is your problem ?
miguel , look ...
i just don' t want to keep coming back here for it , okay ?
harvey , that patient' s due to be admitted a week from now .
why do you always fight ?
how often must we go through this ?
just give me the fucking chart !
we' il see what the doctor has to say .
fine .
what ?
what do you mean , another two weeks ?
jesus christ .
you' ve got to come home sometime !
hello ?
goddamn it .
just walk straight out to the desk .
i know .
okay , fine .
you all set ?
yeah .
i was starting to lose it .
between the lump , the loneliness , i felt like everything was closing in on me .
and with joyce over there saving the world ...
i never felt more like a sell out hack in my life .
okay .
you know , folks , if it really is true that misery loves company ... our next guest must always have a house full of people .
okay , asshole .
you' re gonna pay for that one , man .
ladies and gentlemen , please welcome back harvey pekar .
harvey , this is not the forum .
this is not meet the press .
you just want me to talk about simple minded bullshit , david .
i ain' t co opted like you .
i got things to say .
relax , harvey .
for instance , i want to talk about a conflict of interest situation .
can we do that , david ?
how about that ?
you know , like ge owning this network , nbc .
ge has basically become a military , industrial , financial ...
can we get the singing shitzu back here ?
has he left the building yet ?
you think nbc news is gonna cover what they do fairly ?
i got other things i wanna talk about .
that' s enough ...
just shut up , man !
don' t push me .
i' m doing my own thing .
harvey , this is not ...
are you afraid of the truth , david ?
it' s not about what you' re saying .
it' s about your choice of venue .
it may come as a shock to you , but this is a comedy show .
not tonight , it ain' t .
joe , come check this out .
take your winning personality and go get your own show .
i don' t want my own goddamn show .
we' ve had you on this show many times .
you sulk , complain , and promote your comic book ... and you really haven' t been appreciative .
you didn' t do me any favors , okay ?
i' m still a file clerk .
i' ve always been a file clerk ... and it' s no thanks to you or to your goddamn pathetic audience .
we' re gonna take a commercial .
and when we come back , guess who' s not gonna be here .
you want me to leave , david ?
come on , ask me like a man .
don' t go hiding behind a commercial .
are things okay at home , harvey ?
things are just great at home .
okay , goodbye , dave .
goodbye , america , and thanks for nothing .
harvey pekar , ladies and gentlemen .
we' il be right back .
i guess you really did it this time .
who the hell cares ?
that show wasn' t helping my sales anyway .
baby ... please don' t go away anymore .
i just can' t take being alone , you know ?
if you met those kids over there , you wouldn' t ask that of me .
i' m telling you something ... if you go away again , i' m gonna lose it .
this is not up for discussion .
i need this in my life right now .
i do appreciate the fact that you missed me so much , baby .
harvey , what is that ?
i don' t understand .
does " tumor " mean the same thing as " cancer " ?
we know the growth is malignant .
what we don' t know is how far it may have spread .
once we have the results , we can make informed decisions about treatment .
cancer .
diagnosis .
mrl .
cancer .
how can i have cancer ?
i don' t feel sick at all .
that' s a positive thing .
my cousin norman died of lymphoma .
he was 29 .
he was a brilliant oncologist .
stop it !
you' re not gonna die , harvey .
you' re not .
what' s gonna happen to you , baby ?
who' s gonna take care of you ...
look at me and focus .
we are gonna get through this .
i understand illness .
i know how to handle these things .
yeah , but that' s you , you know ?
i' m not strong enough .
i don' t know how to be positive .
i can' t do that .
i can' t do it .
yes , you can .
no , i can' t .
i' il tell you how .
you' il make a comic book of the whole thing .
you' il document every detail .
and that way , you' il remove yourself from the experience until it' s over .
i can' t do that .
i' m just not strong enough .
man , i just wanna die .
that' s fine .
i' il do it without you .
i' m fred .
you called me about the comic book .
right , the artist .
come in .
this is my daughter , danielle .
i had to bring her along .
i hope you don' t mind .
hi , danielle .
what' s that you' re holding ?
a pony .
a pony ?
what' s his name ?
she' s a girl .
clarissa .
oh , i see .
i' m joyce , and i' m very pleased to meet both you and clarissa .
i' m real sorry to hear about harvey .
is he here ?
he' s going to work till next week when he starts the chemo .
that' s why i want this project started ... because once he' s stuck here , i know he' il take over .
shit .
fucking idiot .
hey , joyce , open the door .
i forgot my keys again .
hold the door .
open the fucking door , man !
hey , harvey .
fred .
what' s going on , man ?
you see , i thought it was a great idea .
joyce said if we try to just follow you through your treatments ...
she thought it was a good idea , too , didn' t she ?
here' s some of the ideas we' ve been batting around .
all right .
jesus .
joyce has no idea what she' s doing , man .
there' s too many words in these frames .
when are you coming back , fred ?
she said something about next tuesday , which is fine with me .
it' s just ...
the only thing is , i might have the kid again .
my ex wife is supposed to take her , but i don' t have much faith in her showing up .
she' s in worse shape than me these days .
next week ... my treatment begins .
do me a favor , man .
bring the kid , will you ?
thanks .
i wanna die .
joyce .
what ?
what' s wrong , harvey ?
what are you doing up ?
what is it ?
tell me the truth .
am i a guy who writes about himself ... in a comic book ?
or am i just a character in that book ?
what are you talking about ?
what are you saying ?
if i die , will that character keep going ?
or will he just fade away ?
oh , my god .
harvey , wake up .
wake up , harvey .
come on .
oh , no .
come on , wake up .
can you hear me ?
my name is harvey pekar .
harvey pekar .
1960 was the year i got my first apartment and my first phone book .
now , imagine my surprise when i looked up my name ... and saw that in addition to me , another harvey pekar was listed .
you know , i was listed as harvey l. pekar .
my middle name is lawrence .
he was listed as harvey pekar .
therefore , his was a pure listing .
then in the ' 70s ...
i noticed that a third harvey pekar was listed in the phone book .
now , this filled me with curiosity .
how can there be three people with such an unusual name in the world ...
let alone in one city ?
then one day ... a person i work with expressed her sympathy to me ... concerning what she thought was the death of my father .
she pointed out an obituary notice in the newspaper ... for a man named harvey pekar .
and one of his sons was named harvey .
these were the other harvey pekars .
and six months later , harvey pekar , jr .
died .
although i' d met neither man ...
i was filled with sadness .
what were they like ? " i thought .
it seemed our lives had been linked in some indefinable way .
but the story does not end there .
for two years later , another harvey pekar appeared in the phone book .
who are these people ?
where do they come from ?
what do they do ?
what' s in a name ?
who is harvey pekar ?
we' ve got t shirts for sale upstairs , if you' re interested .
here' s our man , a year later .
somehow i made it through the treatments , and the doctors are optimistic .
i guess joyce was right about doing a big comic book .
we published the thing as a graphic novel , our first collaboration ... and ended up with rave reviews .
we even won a couple of national book awards .
go figure .
those are beautiful .
did you find this in there ?
i didn' t even see those .
ever seen one of these flowers ?
are you finished ?
danielle , i love it .
very expressive colors .
what is it , harvey ?
that was the doctor .
he says i' m all clear .
the weirdest thing that came out of my illness was danielle .
with her real mother running around who knows where ... and seeing how well her and joyce got on ...
fred decided she' d have a better life with us .
i was scared at first , but then i thought , what the hell .
she' s a good kid .
hi , harvey .
so we ended up taking her and raising her as our own .
you keep reading them backwards .
i like reading them backwards .
is that one you ?
i keep telling you , all of them' s me , man .
you look like a monster .
wait till you see what you' re gonna look like .
me ?
yeah , you' re part of the story , too , now .
what story ?
the story of my life .
i know i' m not as interesting as the little mermaid and all that magical crap ...
i think i' m gonna write my own comic .
yeah ?
what about ?
i' m not sure yet .
but not about you .
i think you have enough already .
you should write about things in your own life .
you know , like school ... and ponies .
i don' t know .
girl stuff .
do you have to hold my hand ?
what are you , embarrassed of me ?
i know , i' m embarrassing .
i felt the same way about my father .
no .
it' s just , when you hold my hand , you squeeze it too hard .
go on .
joyce is right .
you are obsessive compulsive .
go on .
yeah , so i guess comics brought me to life .
but don' t think this is some sunny , happy ending .
every day is still a major struggle .
joyce and i fight like crazy .
and she barely works .
the kid' s got add and is a real handful .
my life is total chaos .
with a little luck , i' il get a window of good health between retiring and dying .
the golden years , right ?
who knows ?
between my pension and the chunk of change i get for this film ...
i should be able to swing something .
sure , i' il lose the war eventually .
but the goal is to win a few skirmishes along the way , right ?
surprise !
for he' s a jolly good fellow
which nobody can deny
surprise .
