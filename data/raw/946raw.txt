every story starts somewhere .
and mine begins in a small town called silver springs , nevada .
my mother was an ex show girl .
emphasis on the " ex .
there' s my father .
he came by for the beer .
whoa .
oh , my god .
look at this .
oh , my god !
happy birthday , donna
whoa , whoa
i didn' t get to blow out my candles .
but i do remember my wish .
that i could get as far away from silver springs as possible .
well , that didn' t happen .
come on , sweetie .
my mom , always optimistic , was on her fourth husband , pete .
come on , baby .
come on .
ugh .
what happened ?
rodney .
his son .
no need for dna testing on that one .
i still had my mind on a different life beyond silver springs .
then i met tommy , the high school quarterback .
boy , was he a great kisser .
together , i knew we were going places .
he went as far as assistant manager at big lots and used his pull to get me a job in the luggage department .
this is the best bag money can buy .
bar none .
you' ve got the nylon twill with dupont protective coating .
this is the bag you use when you fly ?
well ...
i' ve actually never been on an airplane , but if i ever get to go on one , this thing is gonna follow me around like my own little dog .
my birthday came , and i didn' t have to make the same old wish .
tommy and i had found our way out .
hey .
i caught you .
donna .
hey .
i thought you didn' t get off till 8 : 00 .
i got becky to cover for me .
oh .
oh !
now that you' re here ...
let me have the card .
no , no .
it' s silly .
just forget about it .
it' s actually kind of corny .
hey , i brought that dress that you like .
want to watch me change ?
no , hey , donna .
ah !
don' t read that .
come on .
i like things that are corny .
you' re breaking up with me ?
in a birthday card ?
why ?
well , they don' t make breaking up cards .
i thought that ...
we had plans .
donna , don' t take this the wrong way .
i decided to take somebody else to tucson .
somebody else ?
yeah .
linda from lawn chairs .
actually , it' s brenda in barbecues .
look , donna , you' re a great girl .
really , you are .
but with this promotion and transfer to tucson ,
i just need to shake things up a bit .
business is business .
come on , donna .
face it .
you' re a small town girl .
you belong here .
we' re back with more " pure oxygen , " talking to sally weston .
can you tell our viewers the moment you decided to change your life ?
i left my job at big lots and thought about becoming an alcoholic .
just kidding .
but then something happened .
there i was with garbage in front of me .
the worst moment of my life .
i thought , " what am i gonna do ?
for a second i was real scared .
since i was a girl , all i heard from people was ,
you are nothing .
nothing is what you deserve .
but that night something clicked .
and i just knew i was worth something .
from a little girl in west texas to the world' s most famous flight attendant .
author of " my life in the sky .
can we get a shot of that ?
motivational speaker .
i' m curious .
why' d you pick flying ?
no matter how much i love that sleepy little town , none of my dreams were waiting down there .
they were waiting up there .
and frankly , people , no matter where you' re from , no matter who people think you are , you can be whatever you want .
but you got to start right now .
right this second , in fact .
but how ?
you should start by buying my book .
i agree .
but you can' t have my copy .
my life in the sky .
we' il be right back with more " pure oxygen .
i took sally' s advice .
sure , sierra airlines wasn' t the biggest and the best .
it was the smallest and the absolute worst .
but everybody has to start somewhere .
donna , why do you want to be a stewardess ?
well , for all the travel opportunities .
and for the excitement .
we' re a budget airline .
we fly from laughlin to fresno .
once a week to bakersfield .
we got five planes .
we fly gamblers and drunks .
right .
i want to provide those gamblers and drunks with the best service in the sky .
you' re gonna love the uniform .
our motto is " big hair , short skirts , and service with a smile .

the whole thing ?
with my bare hands .
how did you all meet ?
oh , that is a cute story .
jack was flying to maui to build the kaanapali towers resort .
i was serving him .
this was first class .
he must have pushed that call button 20 times .
more warm nuts .
more warm nuts .
no man alive could eat that many warm nuts .
so then , when i saw this huge pile of warm nuts under his seat , it hit me .
it wasn' t the nuts he wanted .
it was me !
oh !
where have you been all my life , mr. man ?
what was it like , mrs. weston , when you started flying ?
sally , please .
oh , it was wonderful .
the exotic cities .
yeah , i hear all those europe guys are uncircumcised .
nope .
not all .
so , is it difficult to get those international routes ?
you have to have seniority .
should i apply now ?
and even then , you have to speak several languages and serve impeccably .
oh , but it was worth it .
it was different then .
people dressed for flights .
it was like every night going to the opera .
every night was ...
magic .
oh !
you scared me .
sorry .
there' s something i want to show you .
this is all yours ?
you bet .
it' s everything i wanted .
you can have everything you want , too , if you stay focused .
follow your head , not your heart .
what do you mean ?
i sense something in you , donna .
something special .
what is it ?
hunger .
you do ?
mm hmm .
i had it myself .
i wanted paris .
first class international .
and nothing less .
so today this is all mine .
you' re just like me , donna .
my old uniform .
oh , that is so beautiful .
well , of course it is .
we' re royalty .
oh , it suits you .
feel the fabric .
it' s so ...
soft ?
and luxurious ?
paris .
first class international .
donna , say it .
paris .
first class international .
it' s the only road to happiness .
paris .
first class international .
it' s your destiny .
ten hut !
at ease .
welcome aboard .
you should all be very , very proud .
the simple fact that you' re here at the royalty learning center means you' ve joined a very special family .
the royal ... ty family .
our first goal here at royalty airlines is to bring back the style and the glamour to the art of flying .
in the coming weeks , i' il impart to you the necessary hands on training for you to function at the highest level .
up there .
but don' t expect an easy road .
no , no , no .
an easy road comma don' t expect one .
i will not hold your hand .
i' m not even gonna touch it .
now , what i want all of you to do is to stand up .
come on .
let' s go .
stand up .
and i want you to look underneath your seat .
go ahead .
taped to the bottom , each of you will find a $1 bill .
now , what did we learn from this exercise ?
we learned you have to get off your ass to make a buck .
down .
thank you .
now , we don' t actually learn to make bucks here , but we do learn to treat our passengers ... ... iike royalty .
yeah .
so , shall we get started ?
there' s an oxygen mask up above you ...
on a hidden shelf .
before helping the people who love you , put it on yourself .
excuse me , miss .
yes ?
this is first class .
i want my hand towels .
i want my little booties .
and i want my warm nuts !
warm nuts .
here you go .
you call these warm nuts ?
i' ve felt warmer nuts on a polar bear !
stop it !
no .
what did we learn here ?
upon encountering a dp , or a disgruntled passenger , take the following steps .
a " listen .
two acknowledge .
and " c " explain .
and on a more personal note ,
i have actually felt a polar bear' s nuts .
yeah .
quite toasty warm .
get those masks on !
louder !
there' s an oxygen mask up above you on a hidden shelf .
before helping the people who love you ...
we learned to keep our heads , to stay calm , and to not get freaked out , okay ?
just remember the h. a. l. t. principle .
disgruntled passengers are hungry , angry , lonely , tired , and have a skewed vision of the world .
okay .
so that' s h. a. l. t. s.
hungry , angry , lonely , tired , skewed vision .
h. a. l. t. s. v. w.
go !
asses the window
okay .
stop .
what ?
it' s assess the window .
not " asses " the window .
you put the wrong em phasis on the wrong syl lable . ... with a skewed world view , so really , it' s v. i. c. t. i. m. s. w. v.
but you get my point .
assess the window !
is it good to go ?
drop !
drop !
remove your shoes !
don' t take anything with you !
whoa !
yes .
eleven seconds !
the trainee record !
what' s the matter ?
who am i kidding ?
i' m never gonna fly a 747 .
headed right for royalty express .
probably wind up in cleveland .
christine , stop being so hard on yourself .
you just have to concentrate .
that' s easy for you to say .
you' re headed for new york and london .
i am not smarter than you , okay ?
who cares , anyway , what to do in a water landing ?
they don' t land in the damn water .
they crash .
people always say that everyone' s good at something .
that everyone has some sort of hidden skill .
what if i don' t ?
what if there' s nothing that i' m good at ?
what about your hickeys ?
yeah .
oh .
come on .
would you stop beating yourself up ?
you are gonna get through this .
here' s what we' re gonna do .
dry those little eyes .
where' d you get these ?
oh , from sally weston' s house .
there' s a whole bunch of them .
aren' t they cool ?
you stole them ?
no .
they' re guest soap .
we were guests .
they were there for us .
yeah , to use , you know ?
not to take .
come on .
everybody does it .
it' s no big deal .
excuse me .
didn' t you read chapter 7 ?
chapter 7 .
employment and ethics .
if you get caught stealing anything , you will get fired like that .
you' re not mad at me , are you ?
no .
yes !
time' s up .
pencils down .
books closed .
remember to write your identification number on the front of the exam booklet and pass it forward .
so , how' d you do ?

there must be some mistake .
ms. jensen , try and take this news with the poise and grace that one associates with royalty airlines .
we expect our employees to behave in a professional manner and to handle setbacks with integrity .
screw integrity !
i am not going back to commuter !
oh , my god .
i can' t believe this is happening .
this cannot be happening .
royalty express , although commuter , is still a member of the royalty family , okay ?
it' s not my destiny .
i want my destiny .
well , i' m sorry .
but you' il be eligible to reapply after one year .
one year ?
i was the best in my class .
you were there .
i' ve seen it a hundred times .
you peaked too soon .
i don' t understand .
how do i explain this ?
you' re what we in the trainee business call a " peak too sooner .
yeah .
it happens .
i aced that test .
i want to see it .
that' s not procedure .
call sally weston .
she' il tell you .
sally weston .
although an excellent mentor , she has no authority in these matters .
that is bullshit .
want to know what' s bullshit ?
eye exams !
that' s what' s bullshit !
i wanted my destiny , too , you know !

i had dinner with this incredible woman who was charging after her dreams and not hiding out .
i thought to myself , " i could do that .
so i' m here now for a year .
it' s flying by .
i really miss my family , which is uncool .
so please don' t tell anybody i told you .
i promise .
okay , here' s how i look at it .
cleveland is like this great , big , giant waiting room .
all we have to do is put in our year and somebody' s gonna call our name .
cleveland' s like this great , big dentist' s office , and we' re next on the list .
exactly .
now all we have to do is think about something to occupy our time .
mm hmm .
hmm .
for once in my life , i have someone who needs me
someone i' ve needed so long
for once , unafraid , i can go where life leads me
somehow i know i' il be strong
for once , i can touch
what my heart used to dream of
sometimes , just when you brace yourself for a really bumpy flight , it' s amazing how the skies can suddenly clear .
but between my busy schedule and the extra job ted took to pay for school ,
i spent too many nights ordering pizza and watching tnt .
just a minute .
small cheese pizza with everything . $8 even .
just call me a sucker for a man in uniform .
i cannot believe we got this route .
oh , my god .
a real business class ?
and guess what i get to do in half an hour .
bake cookies .
oh , my god .
you are so not royalty express material .
i can' t believe on a test you' re as bad as me .
you studied like crazy .
get out of here .
the more i think about that test , the more convinced i am that something got screwed up .
i might hire a lawyer to check into it .
hey , you could help me out with that .
i' m not a lawyer .
well , you' re gonna be .
you think so , huh ?
mm hmm .
how is it that you believe in me so much ?
somebody' s got to .
check out 3b .
isn' t he cute ?
aside from the headphone hair .
when i asked him to put his tray in its upright position , he said , " that too ?
i mean , hello .
and those arms .
my god .
he' s like something out of " men' s health .
well , i' il root for you even though it' s against policy .
you rat me out and i' il stop letting you do my paperwork .
all i want is a little of what you' ve got with ted .
oh , god .
he is great .
did i tell you he wants me to meet his family for christmas ?
and that' s bad news why ?
for me , anything that ever has to do with family is always bad news .
please .
don' t make me cry .
the thing is , randy , i' ve always been this girl from silver springs that everybody' s said ,
you' re never gonna do anything , never gonna get out of here .
i just worry that if i fall in love with ted , what' s gonna happen to everything i' ve worked so hard for ?
okay .
fine .
don' t fall in love with him .
that' s kind of why i' m having the problem .
it just takes willpower .
you didn' t fall in love with me , did you ?
you' re gay .
but it still took willpower , didn' t it ?
thanks , donna .
come over here , justin .
okay .
who' s next ?
grandma !
it' s from me and ted .
what ?
she can' t hear very well !
it' s from donna and me !
thank you , dear .
what is it ?
it' s an all in one remote control !
now you don' t have to fuss with all those gadgets anymore !
thank you , dear .
oh , merry christmas , ted .
thank you , donna .
now it' s your turn .
you said we weren' t gonna do presents .
just open it .
he said we weren' t gonna do presents .
i said that .
oh , my god .
what do you think ?
you like it ?
it' s so beautiful .
it has two time zones .
if a passenger asks you what time it is , you can think about me .
i love it .
she' s a great gal .
i think so .
oh , you' re not out of the woods yet , donna .
you got one more present .
from all of us .
it' s the annual stewart family uniform !
i got you a medium .
i hope you like it baggy .
thank you .
time for the team photo !
everybody get over by grandma .
come on , donna .
jensen , get in here .
it' s a family picture .
oh , no , donna .
don' t be shy .
come on , donna .
it' s flashing .
quick !
quick .
smile .
cheese .
well , you survived your first stewart family christmas .
it was good .
i never knew a family could be like that .
no fighting .
no yelling .
normally , that " everyone dressing the same " thing would kind of freak me out .
but i even like that dorky red sweater .
is that all that' s going on in that head of yours ?
i' m just not used to all that , you know ?
dan .
hi , donna .
how' s life treating you ?
all right .
i want to get a confirmation for tomorrow .
sure .
we got you going to pittsburgh on flight 285 at 0800 .
any chance of that dallas route opening up ?
let me have a look .
sorry .
nothing yet .
all right .
well , thank you .
have a good trip , donna .
oh , my god .
christine ?
donna !
oh , my god !
oh , my god !
what are you doing in cleveland ?
my new york l. a. flight had mechanical problems , so they dumped us here for the night .
oh , right .
god .
look at your hair .
oh , yeah , i know .
i' m going for a more classic look .
goes better with chanel .
right .
i have the sweetest little apartment on west 73rd street .
oh , you would be so proud of me .
you know what , ted ?
if it wasn' t for donna ,
i would' ve never made it through basic training .
oh , now , that' s not really true .
it is .
actually , just last week ,
i was thinking about how well you trained me .
i was on the new york to chicago flight , right ?
this guy gets on .
he has this huge musical case .
he' s trying to stuff it into the overhead compartment .
clearly the thing is too big .
he refuses to check it .
so i thought , " what would donna do right now ?
so i politely said to him ,
either you check it or you deplane .
that' s not what i would do .
what do you mean ?
well , you must , as a flight attendant , offer the option of buying another seat at half price for that oversized item .
it' s section 23 . 4 of the manual .
well , i can' t remember everything .
but you should' ve remembered that one .
it was the last question on our exam .
say , christine , do you have any of those little wings ?
my nephew' s been begging me for some .
they don' t have them on express .
let me look .
let' s see what we' ve got in here .
whoa .
oh , i love these .
love it , love it .
i have so much garbage in here .
ah .
here we go .
future pilot .
thank you .
enjoy .
there .
we could do shots if you want to .
let' s do shots .
want to ?
paris .
first class international .
paris .
first class international .
i think i' m doing very well at express .
but i just can' t stop thinking there was some kind of mix up with my test .
some kind of computer malfunction .
those things mess up .
they lose luggage or send bags to the wrong city .
i' m afraid that' s impossible .
the tests are hand graded .
oh , right .
i forgot about that .
i' m sorry .
i' m sure there' s nothing you can do anyway .
who says there is nothing i can do ?
i am sally weston .
i invented this .
before me , they just pointed .
true story .
wow .
i did speak to john .
i asked him if i could see my test .
i begged him .
he said no .
i asked him if you could see the test , and he said no .
don' t you worry about john .
did you see me on " oprah " ?
i scared the hell out of that little wiener dr. phil .
it' s test 1047 .
hello .
it' s sally weston .
oh , my god .
oh , my god .
what is it , donna ?
this isn' t my test .
it' s my number .
it' s number 1047 .
but it isn' t mine .
look at those little hearts .
time' s up .
pencils down .
books closed .
remember to write your identification number on the front of the exam booklet and pass it forward .
so , how' d you do ?
new york , here i come .
i can' t believe it .
i trusted her .
she was my best friend .
oh , my god .
these answers .
no wonder we sent you to express .
we were being nice .
i can' t believe she' d steal my test !
wait a minute .
that night i had you kids over for dinner , someone took my airplane soaps .
oh , my god .
she is probably stealing us blind .
hell , i' il bet she' s got a whole closetful of airline property .
headsets .
booze .
kosher meals .
there' s two things we' ve got to do .
we got to get you retested .
there' s a group next week .
if you do as well as i think , we can reassign you right away .
how soon can you leave cleveland ?
i' d just have to talk to ted .
who' s ted ?
this really great guy that i' m seeing .
oh .
well , i' m afraid you' ve got a decision to make .
yeah .
well , what would you do ?
well , i know what i did .
and so do you , if you read my book .
but , honey , it' s your life .
it' s your decision .
right .
well , i' il call you later .
i' ve got a flight back to cleveland at 4 : 00 .
you said there were two things .
i' il take care of that .
just skedaddle .
don' t miss that flight .
okay .
thanks .
royalty airlines .
hello .
internal security , please .
security .
this is sally weston .
i' m calling to report a code blue for christine montgomery .
put a ghost rider on her next flight .
if you see any violations , i want that klepto picked up as soon as the plane hits pavement .
miss montgomery ?
yeah ?
i have to ask you to come with me .
why ?
who are you ?
royalty security .
please step this way .
hey , jensen !
you were right .
i can' t believe it .
i' m top of my class .
oh , my god .
ted , that is so great .
so get your damn coat on , jensen .
we' re going out to celebrate .
i have to talk to you .
i flew to dallas today .
christine stole my test .
you' re kidding .
so they' re gonna retest me .
wow .
that' s great .
when are they doing that ?
i got to leave right away .
okay .
sure .
no problem .
we' il celebrate when you get back .
the thing is , if i do well on the test ,
i might not be back .
i could get placed in new york .
that' s it ?
we don' t talk about it ?
i come home .
you' re leaving ?
well , we' ve always said that cleveland is just a big waiting room .
for me , the waiting room was my life until i met you .
i' m in love with you .
i can' t let somebody tell me that i' ve seen enough .
not again .
got it .
point taken .
i hated leaving ted .
ted made me feel like i' d finally found home .
the problem was , i wasn' t so sure i was ready to be home .
time' s up .
pencils down .
books closed .
be sure to put your identification number on the front of the exam booklet and pass it forward .
well , well .
congratulations .
i just want you to know that i was against this retesting at this time .
that' s not procedure .
but apparently , miss sally weston doesn' t have the same respect for procedure some of us have had to .
so you' il be happy to know you got a perfect score .
first time in seven years .
the last time was me .
so i imagine you' il have fun .
up there .
living out your destiny .
must be nice .
thank you .
you' re welcome .
mr. whitney , i just want you to know
i couldn' t have done this without you .
yeah , right .
i mean it .
you are an excellent instructor .
i am ?
yes .
that' s the nicest damn thing anyone' s ever said to me .
i' d say we' re both living our destiny .
you do it , donna jensen .
you do it for those of us that can' t .
i will .
thatagirl .
now you get out of here .
oh , and , donna .
fly away .
it' s a long way out the gate
just to glimpse your fate
just to see whether it all works out
and it' s a long road , a heavy load
you got to really wanna go
and just let the others walk around you , now
up and down again , but this time , it' s different
it took some bleeding to straighten me up again
oh , in and out of life
at times , it was difficult
i got a new life , baby
it takes some getting used to , but
no sign of any rain
my skies are clear today
i keep bracing for that rain
but there' s no sign of any
no obstacles in sight
my skies are clear tonight
i keep thinking i might see that cloud arrive
oh , but there' s no sign of it
no , no sign of it
i got a new life , baby
it takes some getting used to , but
no sign of it
no , no sign of it
donna .
christine .
hi .
god .
did you hear the bad news ?
what ?
i got fired .
busted for stealing .
yeah .
so i just wanted to come here and say goodbye .
donna .
you know , isn' t it amazing how there was a ghost rider on my flight ?
well ...
and another thing .
i just can' t help wondering .
how does someone go from royalty express to lnternational in such a short period of time ?
excuse me , christine .
i had you figured out from day one , donna .
what did you say ?
you just couldn' t stand the fact that i was prettier than you .
that i was more fun than you .
that everyone loved me .
all i did was try to help you out .
and you stabbed me in the back .
i never stabbed you in the back , donna .
you switched our exams .
well , if you' re gonna nitpick .
and you left me rotting in cleveland while you went and dotted your i' s with those tacky , little hearts in new york city .
someone had to put you in your place .
little miss perfect .
oh , excellent , donna .
way to go , donna .
ls it hard to get international lines , mrs. weston ?
throwing yourself all over that stupid ted .
you know what ?
you make me sick .
leave ted out of this .
just because you' re pissed off that he wanted me and not you .
get your hands off me .
oh , i' m scared , donna .
what are you gonna do , throw one of your books at me ?
don' t you walk away from me .
ow !
good lord .
out of the way , please .
get her leg .
you know what ?
you got that fancy uniform and that [ spits ] $40 haircut !
but i see right through you !
right to the inside !
welcome aboard .
champagne or caviar ?
nothing for me .
thanks .
sir , champagne or caviar ?
i' m fine .
thank you .
would you care for some champagne or caviar ?
no , thank you .
i would like a vodka straight up , though .
champagne and caviar .
extra wide seats .
and no bologna or cheese .
this was first class .
bonne journee , madame .

i' il see you there .
was that kim and nancy ?
are you happy with your long distance carrier ?
i said you were .
can you believe them ?
i guess they just figure everyone' s home .
will you pose for photos ?
so i' m waiting by the phone
for the blessed ring
like a holy grail
for the fisher king
time is ticking down
like a metronome
rhythm for my brain
and its ceaseless games
i never seem to play them to the beat i hear
though my heartbeat is a beat that beats so near
so i' m changing who i am
' cause what i am' s not good
and i know you love me now
is that donna jensen ?
sally !
what are you doing here ?
we' re creatures of habit .
jack and l .
we have christmas in paris .
new year' s in new york .
wow .
how exciting .
really not .
were you here for christmas , too ?
yes , i was .
gosh .
the champs elysees and the lights .
i loved it .
did i ever tell you about a nasty habit flight attendants pick up on the job ?
no .
we learn to always keep smiling .
even when we' re out of bloody mary mix .
do you remember that guy i was telling you about ?
ted .
of course .
oh , i just really miss him .
that' s all .
well , what' s the problem ?
go fly and see him .
well , i can' t .
i took your advice , and we broke up .
my advice ?
well , sort of .
in your book , you say ,
don' t ever let anything get in the way of your destiny .
darling , i don' t think you read carefully enough .
what i also said was that every pilot needs a copilot .
and it is awful nice to have someone sitting there beside you .
especially when you hit some bumpy air .
oh , i just really miss him .
i just wish i could get him back .
the last time i checked , you were a girl who could make things happen .
so stop feeling sorry for yourself .
and stop worrying about what he' il say .
you' re right .
i' m gonna do it .
all right .
but we have to move fast .
there is a 9 : 00 p . m . direct from paris to chicago .
if you got the last connection out of o' hare , that would put you into cleveland in ...
12 hours .
who am i gonna get to cover my shift ?
are you kidding ?
i still give the best oxygen mask demo in the business .
get going .
pierre , i need a uniform tout de suite .
welcome to new york , where the local time is 7 : 13 a . m .
i' d like to personally thank you for flying with us today and remind you that the last one off the plane has to clean it .
lying in my bed
i hear the clock tick
and think of you
caught up in circles
confusion is nothing new
you say go slow
i fall behind
the second hand unwinds
if you' re lost , you can look and you will find me
time after time
if you fall , i will catch you
i' il be waiting
time after time
hello ?
ted ?
hi , mrs. stewart .
i' m donna .
i don' t know if you remember me .
i' m ted' s friend .
we got you that little clicker thing for the tv .
remember ?
is ted here ?
i messed up .
i really did .
i thought that i was getting everything that i wanted , and ...
i thought paris and ... first class would make me happy .
but ... it didn' t .
' cause ... if you don' t have that person to come home to , then going away is just ...
i love him .
and i just wanted to tell him that he made me happy .
who are you ?
you haven' t heard a single word i' ve said , have you ?
i did .
i love you .
and i want to stay .
i do .
are you sure ?
and you' re gonna be happy ?
yep .
in cleveland ?
how are you gonna be happy in cleveland ?
' cause you' re in cleveland .
i' m sorry .

but i learned there is more than one way to spread your wings .
