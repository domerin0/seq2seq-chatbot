alcohol revives me .
the later it gets , the hornier i get .
another glass .
a little sip .
tell me , jane ...
what year are you in ?
4th year .
a senior should know better .
what are you doing with tun ?
he' s a hunk .
you keep saying that .
making jim ask for girl' s numbers .
then breaking their hearts .
speaking of broken hearts ...
remember the time ... that girl left him a drunken mess .
her name was kay .
ignore them .
wait .
i have a question .
how can a guy like you get married ?
what' s wrong with me ?
after a long tiring day ...
i want to head home ... to a wife' s embrace or a pet' s face .
not waste my life ... partying with you losers .
not with me .
a good man ... who went whoring with me last night .
fooling around so soon ?
here she comes .
quiet .
what' s so funny ?
nothing .
one last thing ...
one more glass !
what are we listening to ?

it' s beautiful .
you guys seem tight .
do you meet often ?
what are you looking at ?
beautiful you .
what a sap .
are you hurt ?
tun ...
is she dead ?
wait !
drive away .
i said drive away !
drive away !
get closer , please .
okay .
big smile , nuch .
or you won' t look pretty .
all science majors ... gather for a class photo .
they' re calling you .
where' s jane ?
taking photos with her friends .
i though maybe you broke up .
come !
let' s go .
i phoned but you didn' t pick up .
was it on silent ?
nuch asked about you today .
when will you be free ?
she wants to ...
jane .
how can you act like this ?
pretending nothing happened .
since that night ...
i haven' t slept soundly .
i' m upset as well .
at least we should have checked .
it was an accident .
that' s easy for you to say .
you weren' t behind the wheel .
hi , ti .
hey .
how' s business ?
with you here this early ... business should be bad .
are my prints ready ?
yeah .
just a sec .
here .
is your processor broken ?
let' s see .
the nerve .
nice prints and you' re great .
if they suck , it' s my fault .
let' s check the negative .
no way .
i took them .
i should know .
we' il see .
see .
your negative are bad .
tun .
tun .
tun .
can you hear me ?
help !
help !
don' t be scared .
i' m here now .
what' s wrong with your camera ?
i don' t ' know .
the whole roll is ruined .
that many ?
what are these shadows ?
my camera must be broken .
how should i tell nuch ?
tun ...
look at this picture .
that woman ...
do you think she' s dead ?
that' s enough .
i' il have my camera fixed tomorrow .
tun ...
look at this picture .
are you sure it was here ?
excuse me .
what happened ?
a few days ago a car hit the billboard .
must have been drunk .
was anyone hurt ?
no .
just the broken sign .
are you sure ?
what ?
nothing .
thank you .
what ?
you sure you checked everywhere ?
nothing .
thanks anyways .
he called every precinct and hospital .
no accidents were reported that night .
that' s not possible .
what about the girl we hit ?
you sure he called every one ?
maybe someone helped her .
maybe she' s fine .
how could she be fine ?
we ploughed her down .
and even if she' s fine ...
something is in those pictures .
i told you they' re not related to her .
they' re just bad exposures .
get it ?
tun ...
you need to make some merit .
these pictures ... show that a spirit is haunting you .
how long have you been a photographer ?
why are you showing me these ?
i know ...
but don' t you find these shadows strange ?
you want to see spirits ?
i' il show you some .
here .
auntie cham' s spirit .
you know where she is now ?
she' s selling grilled bananas next door .
here' s auntie cham .
and here .
all auntie cham .
taken on the same day .
they' re just double exposures ... and out of focus .
come on .
i know that .
everyone is familiar with this place .
just an ordinary location ... that we pass ... and see everyday .
now look at these pictures ...
taken of the same place .
in these ... the bridge looks nicer .
that means photography ... does not reproduce reality .
it depends on how ... the image is framed .
what is revealed .
what is concealed .
your perspective is critical .
spirit pictures
jane , you' re early .
i' il get it .
hello ?
hello , tun .
it' s jane .
i' il come by later .
hello ?
tun , can you hear me ?
hello ?
tun !
tun !
hello ?
hello ?
what' s wrong ?
i don' t ' know .
my neck' s hurt since the accident .
you should go see a doctor .
i' m sure it' s not serious .
what' s the use of talking to these spoofs ?
real ghosts
are you a reporter ?
no .
the funeral foundation sent us .
we run a legal operation .
we have all the right permits .
excuse me .
are all these pictures fakes ?
piak !
tell the boss he has guests .
everyone fakes them .
you know ... these photos are always a hit .
any issue with them sells out .
but you think ... we can always find real ones ?
isn' t that deceiving the public ?
our readers ... want to see scary photos .
they don' t want loves stories .
does that mean every photo is fake ?
i didn' t say that .
take a look .
see anything ?
this is the first photo i had .
i took it at home .
the shadow ... bears a likeness to my mom .
believe what you will .
but this picture ... was taken after she passed away .
you know ... sometimes ... spirits long for their loved ones .
in my opinion ... these pictures ... represent more than ... macabre urban legends .
they are signs .
think about it .
why would the dead ... return to the living ...
without a message to convey ?
most importantly ...
i believe ... these shadows ... are related to someone in the picture .
a father ... mother ... or lover .
or someone ... you maligned in life .
how can we tell if they' re real ... and not fakes ?
what about polaroid' s ?
can you fake them ?
you load the film and press the shutter .
the photo ejects .
tell me then ...
how can they be faked ?
how do we know what they want ?
perhaps ... the answer is in the photo .
two more poses .
big smiles .
let' s have a different pose .
embrace her , hold the bouquet ... and kiss her cheek .
beautiful .
we' re done .
thank you both .
take them to the dressing room .
what the ...
who' s doing that ?
aum , check the fuse !
hey !
aum !
aum !
who' s doing that ?
is it you , aum ?
who is it ?
aum , where are you ?
who' s there !
i asked who it is !
where are you , aum ?
who' s there !
please step off the scale .
step on it again .
been working hard lately ?
not really .
how long has it hurt ?
for quite awhile .
but it' s gotten worse lately .
i had a car accident .
an accident ?
physically , you' re fine .
you shouldn' t worry .
but it really hurts .
your x rays are normal .
it may be a sprain .
try the medicine i prescribed .
mr. tun , please pick up your prescription .
take this medicine ... 3 times a day after meals ... until the prescription runs out .
lying bastard .
pardon ?
yes ?
nothing .
lying bastard .
lying bastard .
as for this medicine ...
sir !
what' s wrong ?
... is rarely seen .
when grasshoppers begin mating ... the male smells the female ... from a distance up to 100 meters .
the male carefully approaches the female .
it hooks itself onto her belly .
and they begin to mate .
the female' s response is surprising .
the male becomes her prey .
she slowly eats off his head ... while they are mating .
eventually ... the male succumbs to death .
excuse me , where is room 301 ?
jane .
jane .
jane .
who' s there ?
tonn ...
what' s wrong ?
tun ...
i' m going to die .
what' s going on ?
the photos ...
bring me those photos .
what photos ?
are you drunk ?
those photos ...
where did you hide them ?
give them to me .
remember that bitch .
calm down .
what photos ?
just give them to me !
please calm down .
tonn , calm down .

tonn .
i' il call your wife .

natrenapa chan ngam , honor society 1995

tonn .
natrenapa chan ngam
tonn !
tonn !
tonn !
tonn !
i' m really sorry .
do you know ...
what was bothering him ?
no .
suddenly he ...
it' s your gang' s fault .
have you all gone insane ?
what do you mean ?
you' ve all committed suicide .
who ?
don' t you know ?
the other two ... also killed themselves .
which two ?
the two who sat next to you .
who' s this woman ?
where did you get that ?
she' s the shadow in the photos , right ?
who is she ?
how is she related to you ?
i knew her in college .
her name is natre .
she was a quiet person ... without any friends .
we all thought she was weird .
i felt sorry for her .
we dated but i kept it secret .
she loved me a lot .
she threatened to slit her wrists .
i didn' t know what to do .
my friends thought it was funny .
how were they involved ?
why are they dead ?
they ...
what did they do ?
i don' t know .
tonn said he' d take care of it .
after that , natre disappeared .
i never saw her again .
didn' t you try to stop them ?
how could you let it happen ?
what could i do ?
now everyone is dead .
i' m ...
i' m going to die next .
it' s funny how ... we always say ... if we could turn back time ... we ... we would reverse all our wrongs .
do you think she' s okay ?
will she be there ?
go to sleep .
i' il keep you company tonight .
excuse me .
do you have any toilet paper ?
can i poo first ?
i' m sorry .
what' s bothering you ?
tun .
what' s wrong ?
what is it ?
is it around here ?
excuse me .
do you know where this is ?
mom , where is this house ?
ma' am .
excuse me ...
is this natre' s house ?
what do you want ?
well ...
we' re her friends .
natre' s friends ?
come inside .
have some water .
you must be tired .
did you drive from bangkok ?
yes .
we' d like to ask about natre .
she' s not feeling well .
she' s taking a nap .
should i wake her ?
stay for dinner .
i was about to cook .
i' m making her favourite dish .
natre will be so happy .
her friends don' t visit often .
wait right here .
where are you going ?
how dare you ?
did she commit suicide ?
we should cremate her .
no .
i won' t cremate her .
ma' am ...
i don' t know if you believe such things ... but i' d like you to look at these photos .
they were taken around campus .
some of the places ... were rooms natre had been in .
and these shadows appeared
i think that ...
natre' s spirit is restless .
natre ...
my dear natre .
why don' t you visit me ?
can you tell me what happened ?
why she left bangkok ?
ma' am ...
ma' am .
these shadows ... might mean her spirit is not at peace .
we should hold her funeral .
please .
when she came home ... she seemed different .
she wouldn' t talk to anyone .
no one knows what happened in bangkok .
then she overdosed on pills .
luckily , her mother found her ... and got her to the hospital on time .
when she recovered ... she climbed on the hospital roof ... and jumped off the edge .
why wouldn' t her mom cremate her ?
she' s been distraught ever since natre' s death .
no matter what she refused to cremate her .
all the villagers were scared .
no one wanted to socialize with her .
can' t sleep ?
tell me the truth ...
did you love natre ?
i tried to ...
i believed that one day i would .
but i was fooling myself .
when i broke it off ...
i was a total asshole .
but she still loved me the same .
i want this to be over .
if she wants me to die i will .
don' t say that .
it' s almost over .
no it' s not .
i know she' il come for me .
tun .
we' ve come this far .
and you' re sorry for what you did .
i' m sure she knows .
don' t talk about death anymore .
i' m sorry .
do you still love me ?
no matter what you won' t leave me , right ?
jane .
tun ...
jane ...
where did you go ?
why did you leave me alone ?
we' ve got to leave .
asshole !
why did you leave me ?
didn' t you love me ?
how could you leave me ?
how could you leave me ?
tun ...
are you feeling better ?

the abbot said ...

it' s over .

i didn' t recognize you .

jane ...
why are you crying ?
asshole ...
how could you be so cruel ?
where did you find these ?
if i didn' t find them ...
i' d be a fool forever , right ?
let me explain .
what' s there to say ?
i always believed you .
i thought i knew you .
tun .
take her picture ... so she doesn' t blab .
tun , help me .
i know it was wrong .
take her picture now !
what' s wrong !

tun , help me .
i never forgave myself .
but i was young and stupid .
i' ve heard enough .
i' m going home .

i thought you loved me !

till death do us part !
she' s gone now .
sometimes ... spirits long for their loved ones .
