listen , there' s something else .
we got a tape today .
what are you talking about ?
there' s no two ways to put this .
jessica and the winthorpe girl were kidnapped .
you' re kidding .
does this have to do ... ?
no .
absolutely not .
they don' t even know who jessica is .
well , is it money or ... ?
we don' t know anything yet .
well , is she okay ?
she' s alive .
the abu karaf can no longer not do anything ... ... when our brothers are tortured and oppressed .
these prisoners of war will be executed ... ... within a week if our demands are not met .
all members of the abu karaf must be released with full pardons .
i demand an immediate response !
they got a list of demands as long as your arm .
we have a good relationship with general jantapan .
he favors direct action and is offering full cooperation .
gentlemen , i' m sure you understand the sensitivity of the situation .
we have to ensure this stays in the family .
nothing is released without my express permission .
we must resolve this without harm to the girls or the reputation of the u. s.
we agree fully .
that' s why i' m putting agent washington in charge .
he' s been operating in the area for four years ... ... and is more than qualified for the job .
leon ?
thank you , sir .
the first picture you have there is the current head of the abu karaf .
name' s mongkol .
since he took over ... ... they' ve become more hostile towards the government .
the usual stuff .
ambushing police patrols , small rudimentary bombs .
anything like this before ?
nothing , sir .
where' s their money from ?
arms , mainly .
what about this hopper guy ?
he' s a good man , sir .
it' s a damn shame his daughter' s caught up in this .
tom , didn' t you work with him ?
i trained under him for two years in southeast asia .
he' s been out for 10 years , though .
where is he ?
he left honolulu four hours ago .
lands in sangoon at 6 a . m .
sit on him .
if he starts making waves ... ... pick him up , send him home .
yes , sir .
that' s all .
thank you .
i got a plane to catch .
taxi service this way , sir .
come on .
right here .
excuse me , excuse me .
this way , please .
is this your first time in this town ?
no .
hey , where you come from ?
far away .
far away will be england , right ?
close enough .
all right .
if you need something , just tell me .
i' il get it for you , you know .
okay .
you know , this town , i' m telling you .
there is the beautiful girls , like angels .
we have those younger , sexy girls .
we have a lot of bars here .
not only , we have a specialty massage here in this town .
it' s very nice here .
i just need you to get me where i asked you , okay ?
yeah , i' m going this place that you want to go ... ... but i want to give you information about the town .
if you like to drink some beers ... ... we have young girls , look good , here ... ... nice brown , black .
you' il see , you' il love it .
the ride is over .
how long will you stay ?
a week or two .
how would you like to pay ?
cash .

come back , you asshole !
fuck you !
open the fucking door !
don' t go !
fuck you !
fuck you .
come back here !
you know my situation .
yes , sir .
it' s become an international issue , and i' m under a lot of pressure .
i understand , sir .
it' s my men that are being killed by the abu karaf .
we' re working with the cla to finalize plans .
just make sure you don' t act without consulting me .
we can' t afford to upset anyone else .
yes , sir .
don' t let this get out of control .
he won' t leave me alone .
what' s your problem , junior ?
asshole , you calling me a junior ?
you look like junior .
oh , you think you' re tough , huh ?
she' s paid for , so it ain' t got nothing to do with you .
i work for club , not you .
what you mean , you work for the club , bitch ?
you work for me .
why don' t you go back to your own genetic puddle ... ... and go for a swim , boy .
so you think you' re tough , you walking in here , huh ?
you all right ?
yeah , i' m ...
what' s going on ?
get out of the way .
what' s going ... ?
jake .
we' ve got to talk .
let' s go have a beer .
my old buddy , jake hopper .
so , what' s up ?
you here on business or ... ?
i got a little problem .
that' s not like you , jake .
mr. clean .
no , it' s nothing like that .
it' s jessica .
i' m afraid she' s been kidnapped .
what do you ... ?
i mean , where ?
well , they say with the abu karaf up north , but ... ... i don' t know too many muslims be up there , so something' s funny .
what do they want from you ?
i don' t think it has to do with me .
jessica' s friend is the daughter of senator john winthorpe ... ... and i think maybe that' s what they were after .
shit , man .
i' m sorry .
listen , fitch ... ... i' ve been out of the game for 10 years .
i need some goddamn help .
listen , man , i mean ...
i' m not on the inside anymore , you know ?
i' ve got some contacts .
yeah , i' il check it out .
they' ve been giving this government a serious headache .
do the best you can , you hear ?
i' il do whatever it takes , jake .
excuse me .
jake , right ?
yeah .
i want to thank you for what you did .
you' re welcome .
where are you going ?
back to the hotel .
which hotel ?
songwat .
oh .
well , maybe we could get something to eat .
something nice .
yeah , but i' m not hungry .
thanks .
mom ... ... i want you to find dad .
we' re gonna need his help .
i love you , mom .
help !
brother , i haven' t forgotten my english .
you' re looking very good .
thank you .
must be the haircut .
and how are your wounds ?
better .
and how is your heart ?
healing nicely .
i haven' t forgotten that day , jake .
i' m very , very proud of you .
you stay a full monk for 10 years ...
really , really wonderful .
then again , i think you' re the lucky one ... ... because your life is simple .
simple is good .
simple is very good .
i wish i had simple in my life right now .
jake , i' d like to think you came all the way out here to see me ... ... but i don' t think so .
is everything all right ?
it' s jessica .
she' s been kidnapped .
what ?
by who ?
well , they' re saying the abu karaf , but i don' t think so .
is there anything i can do ?
your prayers .
i' m going to go see paijan paitoon .
how are you ?
good .
how was your flight ?
long .
very long .
you must be exhausted .
come .
have some tea .
sure .
we' ve got a unit of rangers that can mobilize whenever i say so .
but i need intel , bad .
this is a preliminary report .
it covers what we know of the abu karaf and their known locations .
i don' t have the resources to deal with this for you .
i fully understand , and we' il offer whatever you need .
i' m very grateful .
until there are dead bodies , my priority is the girls .
of course .
i' m sorry that these animals have involved such innocent children .
you have to eat something .
i' m not hungry .
you need to eat to keep your strength .
we have to stay positive .
i know my dad' s gonna do something about this .
he can' t help us .
he can' t .
you don' t know my dad .
for 10 years , i have pledged my life ... ... to atone for my past .
this is my life .
but now going back on this road ... ... i have great trepidation .
if you walk this road ... ... you may not come back .
i will take with me ... ... everything you have taught me .
it is your choice .
thank you , master .
what are you doing here ?
i come to bring you food .
did fitch put you up to this ?
no .
he does not even know i' m here .
okay .
am i disturbing something ?
no , not at all .
come in .
and she is ... ?
lulu , a good friend of mine .
hey , thanks for the food .
okay ?
i' il call you .
what are you doing here ?
i gave back my vows .
i' m here to help you .
you need to leave now .
i' ve spoken to master paitoon .
he understands .
you' il screw up the last 10 years of what you' ve done .
i don' t want you involved .
jake , you know i' il do anything for you .
i owe you my life .
brother , listen to me .
you don' t owe me anything ... ... but thank you .
listen , i may have a lead for you .
a man by the name of fernand zadir , a french arab .
who is he ?
algeria originally ... ... then france .
been here 15 years .
started in furniture but moved up to bigger stuff .
bigger stuff meaning arms .
yes .
and you know who runs most of his business ?
abu karaf .
exactly .
let' s do it .
that' s fernand zadir .
he' s got half the local police in his pocket .
the other half likes eating here too much to bust him .
who' s that girl ?
her name is lena .
she works for someone rather big .
well , let' s find out how big .
i want to talk to your boss , huh ?
please , sit down .
what can i do for you ?
i was wondering if you could pass on a message for me .
who to ?
to the abu karaf .
what business have you got with them ?
probably none , but some say they had something to do ... ... with the kidnapping of my daughter .
are you sure ?
i' m not sure at all , but i thought we should meet ... ... and straighten things out .
well , that is very unfortunate ... ... but i' m afraid i cannot be of any help .
pass on the message .
hey , fitch .
how you doing ?
jake , how are you ?
all right .
how are you doing ?
all right .
lulu , come here .
i' m gonna get you laid if it kills me .
it' s not what i had in mind .
what do you got ?
i' ve got a guy coming in from singapore ... ... says he did business with the abu karaf .
when' s he coming in ?
says he' s busy .
two days .
okay .
well , listen , did you ever hear of a guy called fernand zadir ?
no .
you sure ?
sure , man .
i can find out .
you do that .
okay .
yeah , man .
i will see him to the door .
yeah , you do that .
jake , i need to talk to you .
about what ?
i can' t tell you here .
there' s something i need to tell you .
fitch lied to you about fernand zadir .
how do you know that ?
he does know him .
i have seen him at the club .
what else ?
nothing .
i have just seen him .
i' ve only been working there for three months .
so , what are you doing here ?
i have some personal problems with my daughter .
how long will you be staying here ?
i really don' t know .

if the boss found out you sent it by the fucking fax , he' d kill you .
don' t be such a fucking idiot .
of course i won' t be there .
go by yourself .
be there at noon .
i thought i could come with you .
okay .
go home .
jake .
yeah ?
be careful .
okay .
somebody up there about to snipe mongkol .
if i let him do that , i could lose the only link to my daughter ... ... and i can' t let that happen .
if i shoot him ... ... a whole world of trouble' s gonna come down on us .
yeah .
here we go .
some men were killed today .
you are responsible .
i know who you are .
okay , so , what would you like me to do ?
mr. hopper , you disturbed an important anti terror raid .
that' s not true , and you know it .
maybe a few days here will help you understand .
our hospitality is famous .
i think that' d be a big mistake .
no , mr. hopper .
you made a big mistake by coming here .
wait .
hold it .
captain , tell your men not to do anything stupid .
let him go , jake .
leon , leon .
my daughter' s rotting somewhere in a goddamn hole .
do you expect me to get with your program ... ... while they' re jerking our chains ?
you won' t leave alive ... ... without me .
do you hear ?
we' il see .
jake .
he' s coming with me .
i' il take full responsibility .
next time i see you , i put a bullet in your head .
go for it .
key .
i' il contact you later .
i' m taking you to the airport .
leave this to us , jake .
you look smart .
we can do this the hard or easy way .
how you want it ?
i hope you' re not threatening me .
you know me better than that .
listen to me .
this is my daughter .
what that means is , anybody who stands in my way ... ... it' s gonna be them or me .
i don' t want you in a body bag .
you ain' t gonna have to worry about that .
you got something else to say ?
i won' t be here the next time , jake .
help me !
jessica !
jessica !
no !
no !
no !
no !
stop !
boss needs her .
she killed my brother .
get the body out of here , leave her alone .
get up !
the time will come .
jade , i' m home .
jade ?
they killed her roommates , and your hotel is full of police .
this place is safe .
we' ve gotta find this guy fernand .
you think he set up mongkol ?
no , he' d be screwing himself .
i' il see what i can do .
i' il meet you back here .
thank you , brother .
you need anything ?
no .
is there any chance anybody saw you go into the office ?
no .
it' s just ...
just jade .
it was horrible .
there was blood everywhere .
i' m sorry .
it' s my fault .
she was so strong .
it didn' t matter what happened .
she ...
she never complained .
and now they' re gonna come for me .
no , you' re with me .
you don' t have to worry .
you' re with me .
you' re not always going to be here .
well , i might not always be here ... ... but you can be with me as long as you want .
okay ?
don' t leave me .
i won' t .
i' m sorry , sir .
leon had hopper released .
things like that happen , captain .
hopper will have his day .
hold out the apple , captain .
sir , please , i can explain what happened .
closer , captain .
there was nothing i could do .
i said , closer .
closer to your head !
if this happens again , you will be the apple .
yes , sir .
fernand zadir met with hopper .
soon , fitch will do the same .
silence them .
fernand uses this place when his shipments come in from the river .
sunti , are you in the mood for a dance ?
we were too late .
he was all we had .
no , no , no .
i don' t think so .
sooner or later , they' il slip up , and when they do ... ... we' il get what we want .
you think they' il come for you ?
i pray they come ... ... because then we' il find out where my daughter is .
no !
no !
don' t hurt me !
get off me !
jess !
this is a final warning .
we will execute them within 76 hours ... ... if our preliminary demands are not met .
where are we going ?
fitch is all we' ve got .
where are we going ?
fitch is all we' ve got .
what ... ?
is this woman cra ... ?
wait here .
is he gonna offer you a deal ?
i don' t think so .
then what does he want ?
i don' t know and i don' t care .
and what brings you to this part of town , mr. hopper ?
as you know , i' m here to find my daughter .
and i' m still looking for my money .
i understand that , but i can' t help you .
if i had your daughter , you wouldn' t be here .
i believe you .
this may be a long shot , but who was that woman at the train yard ?
why should i trust you ?
let me put it this way .
one of the kidnapped girls ... ... is the daughter of senator john winthorpe .
you do not want a bunch of these black op boys coming in here ... ... and tearing up your world .
her name' s lena .
she works for bridgeport .
it kind of seems to me like maybe she' s setting you up .
i think you' re right .
you know they' re gonna manipulate the cla ... ... into believing you' re a threat .
thank you for saving my life .
nothing personal .
for me , it' s all about the girls .
i' m just here for those girls .
hey , buddy .
how you doing ?
great .
how are you ?
you know , fitch , you ain' t nothing but a trailer park bitch .
i think i figured it out .
you lost out on the heroin out of the north .
it all went to the chinese in the triangle .
you lost out on the abu karaf in their arms dealing ... ... because , hey , they' re muslims , and after 9l11 , well ...
so you orchestrate the kidnapping of two poor little innocent girls .
then you enlisted thai special forces and the cla ... ... to crush your business competition , but you made one big mistake .
you kidnapped my daughter .
you done ?
good , because i just wanna say , jake ... ... you' re a fucking dog .
you' re gonna die right here ... ... and your body' s gonna rot in a hole , just like jessica' s .
i suggest you put your gun down ... ... and tell us where his daughter is , okay ?
the general' s taking really good care of her .
what do you think of that ?
great .
i like this one .
i want him .
well , you' re not my type , but , hey .
you enjoying this ?
good ... ... because it' s the last thing you' re ever gonna see .
i liked you much better as a bitch .
are you enjoying it ?
jake , this is between you and him .
please don' t kill him .
jake , give me a break , huh ?
for old times ' sake .
i' m just ...
you know , i' m really confused .
didn' t you just say i' m a dog and i' m gonna die in this hole ... ... just like my daughter ?
sunti , this is not a good man .
what are we gonna do ?
it' s not like i can take him home to mama .
i guess he sealed his own fate .
it came from the president' s office 10 minutes ago .
do you think we' re doing the right thing ?
i don' t think we have any options , sir .
what about the girls ?
senator winthorpe wanted more time ... ... but the boss has made up his mind .
hi , shirley .
get me leon .
yep .
yes , i think it' s for the best .
i can have colonel rose mobile in 12 hours .
did you find hopper yet ?
still nothing , sir .
listen , hopper' s a joke .
a washed up old man .
i' il take care of him .
sir , did you know a fitch mcquoid ?
sure .
he' s retired , right ?
he was found dead in his club three hours ago .
stay in touch .
general , my people have decided to move forward as planned .
i understand .
i' il let my officers know .
you' re doing the right thing , leon .
be careful .
i' il be fine .
listen , i' ve been thinking .
not that anything would happen ... ... but in the rare event that i don' t come back ... ... this will be enough to tide you over for a while .
the phone number of my good friend tom collins is in there .
you call him .
all right ?
keep it .
i will be waiting for you when you get back .
time to go .
all right .
you got both of those ?
yep .
yeah .
leon .
how' d you get this number ?
abu karaf don' t have my daughter .
you know that .
but jantapan does , and i think you know that .
going to get the girls .
thanks .
wait a minute .
hopper .
shit .
clear .
get us out of here !
let us out !
please !
stay here .
you might defeat me ... ... but you cannot defeat the magic .
it' s okay .
it' s your father .
you can come out now .
hey , come here , baby .
what' d you think , i wasn' t gonna come and get you ?
thank you .
thank you .
we did it , jake .
that we did .
sunti .
see you next time , jake .
move in .
go , go , go .
wait , stop .
stop , all right ?
put your men at ease .
goodbye , brother .
