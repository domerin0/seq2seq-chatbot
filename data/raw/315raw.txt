this must be it .
what do you want to bet it' s rent controlled ?

christine , listen to me .
we' ve been over this before .
it' s a terrible thing to lose your parents .
i know it was a long time ago .
the holidays always make something like that feel much worse .
understand , these dreams are your creation .
there' s nothing real about them .
you control them .
they don' t control you .
take another xanax to relieve your anxiety .
you are fine .
trust me .
another vision ?
why didn' t you tell me ?
i didn' t want you to worry . i' m your step mother . it' s my job to worry .
no big deal , really . just someone on the subway car turned into porcelain and shattered .
what' s wrong with me ?
why do i see things ?
why am i so different ?
oh , you don' t know how special you are .
you' re better than everybody else .
just remember that .
i don' t want to be better or worse .
i want to be normal .
i want a normal life .
you have to have patience .
all good things will come to you .
you' il see .
oh , excuse me .
i' m sorry , we' re closed .
i would like to talk to you about thomas aquinas .
father , please , i need you down stairs .
just take these .
father , please .
go .
i' ve already told the police .
thomas was a friend of mine and a colleague .
he had nothing to do with what happened today .
there was no one else on that fire escape .
you don' t understand .
i understand getting shot at , and i don' t like it .
he shot at you ?
no , he shot at my client .
i happened to get in the way .
who' s your client ?
that' s irrelevant right now .
what i want to know is why would a priest try to kill someone ?
you' ve been drinking .
i' ve got 14 years sober , and i can spot that .
well , good for you .
your friend and colleague , was he working for someone ?
yes , he was working for god .
so god ordered a hit on an investment banker ?
there' s a lot that you don' t know .
you think you' ve seen everything ?
you haven' t .
there are things you never dreamed of .
there' s another world out there .
thomas saw it , and it destroyed him .
i' ve seen a lot too , but there' s nothing that would make me cut my tongue out .
yeah , well , wait a few days . what happens in a few days ?
did thomas tell you about a girl ?
no .
i see .
do you believe in god ?
maybe once , but not anymore . what happened ?
we had a difference of opinion .
i thought that my wife and daughter should live , and he felt otherwise .
i' m sorry to hear about the loss .
maybe it' s time for you to renew your faith .
this girl .
is she in trouble ?
does she need help ?
i have a lot ofthings to do here .
excuse me .
excuse me .
i have more questions , if you don' t mind .
i' ve got a question for you .
if you don' t believe in god , how can you understand his adversary ?
now i have to believe in god in order to solve a crime ?
i' m sure that you can fiind your way out .
how many have received the stigmata ?
she' s the third this week .
what is shesaying ?
for your own good , get out and forget what you' ve seen !
was thomas part of this ?
there are forces at work you couldn' t possibly comprehend !
now , please , leave !
let nothing you dismay
remember christ
no , it' s just i hate the fact that they put finals after the holiday .
it ruins the whole meaning of vacation .
i wouldn' t worry .
you always do fine .
besides , a bad grade isn' t the end of the world .
besides , a bad grade isn' t the end ofthe world .
it' s you .
i didn' t where is she ?
the girl is safe .
and what of the world ?
everything is as planned .
our acts go unnoticed , unquestioned .
we' re everywhere .
daddy , who is it ?
is this your daughter ?
yes .
and this is your wife ?
yes .
mm .
oh, you insist you gotta talk that shit
you gotta keep that dog ass breath
all up in my face
and i remember when
you would never lie to a friend
' cause you were so high you were so shy
you were so fucked up anyway
life keeps on tickin ' , tickin ' , tickin ' , tickin ' [ song fades out ]
what' s wrong , baby ?
what' s wrong ?
it was a dream .
he came for me again .
it' s only a dream , angel .
it felt closer .
through out the country , the national guard ... has been put on alert as a precaution [ male newscaster ]
mayor giulianiurged all citizens and police ... to stay calm during this holiday season .
no explanations for how blood on the hands of the christ child , depictedin michelangelo' s famous sculpture of the pieta [ male newscaster ]
... atmosphere of fear and panic , random acts of violence ... are being attributed to satanic cults who seem determined ... to disrupt new year' s celebrations throughout the world .
here in new york
sorry , pal , you can' t come in here .
ahh .
the young boys that you seduced have left their scent upon you .
remember who it is that you serve .
hmm ?
open your eyes , thomas .
look .
look at the face that has haunted your dreams for a thousand years .
they say you can see the future , thomas .
then you must know exactly what i' m going to do to you .
i don' t know what we hope to get from this guy .
he' s got no fuckin ' tongue .
he can write .
fuck me .
there is still no explanation ... for the devastating explosions that rocked midtown two nights ago .
in the wake of tuesday night' s explosion , investigators from the new york city fire department are still at a loss to explain ... why the restaurant suddenly burst into flames , killing at least 35 people .
hey , asshole , watch where you' re going .
hey , i like the shirt .
screw you , man !
hey , kid .
nice shirt .
i' m tellin' you , no one entered the room .
maybe he did it himself .
then how did he get the last scalpel in !
oh , my god .
it just keeps getting better .
i' ve never seen anything like this .
when the thousand years has ended ,
satan shall be loosed out of his prison .
uh , this next part is not clear .
i i i think it' s in english .
it says , " christ
christ in new york .
christ !
well , it' s offiicial .
i' m never sleeping again , ever .
you okay ?
a guy cuts words into his chest .
someone else nails him to the ceiling .
what' s not okay ?
so where we going ?
the girl .
i gotta talk to her , find out what she knows .
w w wait .
we don' t have a name .
that would help .
maybe we do .
maybe it' s not " christ in new york .
maybe it' s , " chris in new york , " " christine in new york .
christine york . " let' s run a d. m. v. check and find out if any of those names come up .
hello , christine york .
sometimes you border on competent .
i know .
it' s scary , isn' t it ?
christine ?
mabel called .
she' d like you to get dressed and join her for lunch .
grazie , carson .
no !
shit !
no !
no !
ahhh !
goddamn it , get off me !
go downstairs and watch the front door !
please !
help !
there is no sanctuary but heaven .
you must go there now .
what are you doing ?
i commend you to almighty god and entrust you [ bobby ]
at what point is this considered ... interfering with a police investigation ?
hey , we are private citizens having a conversation with another citizen .
i mean , i don' t think they' ve found a way to outlaw that .
at least not yet .
please !
no !
may you return to him who formed
go down there .
do whatever you can .
i need more time to finish the last rites .
may christ , the true shepherd [ christine ]
help !
stairs .

may you see your redeemer
... forever , amen .
son of a bitch !

yeah .
check the body down the stairs .

call the police , and get an ambulance .
take it easy .
we' re the good guys .
all right ?
what happened ?
carson .
those men th those men
they tried to kill me .
why ?
eight jets , variable speed .
that' s what i call dying in style .
what kind of girl lives in a house like this , anyway ?
oh , she' s an orphan .
both parents deceased .
after the mother died , the home nurse married the father .
now the nurse is the sole guardian .
i think it' s adorable the way you talk like a real cop .
yeah ?
so you think after they clean up this mess , we could ... [ marge ]
don' t tempt me . soak a little ?
they relax me .
you want one ?
oh , no , thanks .
i drink .
my little girl had one just like it .
really ?
mm hmm .
yeah ?
you snoop through her stuff without asking too ?
when i was looking for something .
what are you looking for ?
a connection .
most days , i don' t feel connected to anyone .
i noticed a lot of religious books outside .
mm .
they' re my stepmother' s .
is she a big believer ?
no , not really .
it' s mostly just kind of like a hobby with her .
do you know a priest by the name of thomas aquinas ?
no .
is that your connection , religion ?
i' ve seen a lot of attempted murders , but i' ve never seen anyone perform the last rites before .
christine ?
in here !
are you all right ?
oh , my god , i just heard what happened !
did they hurt you ?
i' m okay , but carson
i know .
oh .
i' m just so glad you came along when you did .
thanks .
i didn' t realize you knew where the library was , let alone had a card .
well , there' s a lot about me you don' t know .
they' re right outside .
you must bring her .
he is waiting for her .
no , that' s impossible !
they' il follow me and find the temple !
i couldn' t convince her to come here .
yuck !
then i shall have to go to her .
did i mention i had a date tonight ?
not just the inflatable kind .
a real live girl .
did you break up with the inflatable one ?
yeah .
she was just too needy .
everything was about her .
it' s just that this is starting to feel a lot like work .
normally , i wouldn' t mind work because , well, you know , we' d be getting paid .
watching rich people for free .
it just seems odd , doesn' t it ?
okay , i' il wait here .
change your mind about the pill ?
i found something .
christine , what are you doing ? why is that man here ?
i' il be five minutes .
she loves me to death , but she' s a little overprotective .
i took this from one of your attackers .
did you show that to the police ?
no .
if i did , it would end up in a plastic envelope on one of their large shelves .
that' s pretty cynical . well , i' ve put a few of those envelopes ... up on that large shelf myself .
i used to be a cop .
now , this amulet is from a masonic order ... in a former sub herald ofthe vatican knights .
the knights of the holy see .
they await the return of the dark angel to earth .
so , the men that attacked me are devil worshippers ?
no .
this says they' re the good guys .
they' re the ones that are supposed to stop the devil worshippers .
those were the good guys ?
what does that have to do with me ?
those were the good guys ?
what does that have to do with me ?
i' m sorry .
i have a medical condition .
sometimes i see things that aren' t there .
no .
i saw it too .
i' ve been having visions ever since i can remember , but i' ve never shared one before .
there must be an explanation .
i hope so .
i' ve been waiting all my life to hear it .
let' s get out of here !
come on !
you' re not going anywhere .
what are you doing ?
there' s no time to discuss this .
after all these years of waiting , it' s finally happening .
what' s happening ?
you can' t run away now !
stop it !
let her go !
no !
don' t you love me ?
didn' t i give you everything ?
haven' t i been a mother to you ?
no o o !
christine .
you know who i am .
oh , no .
i' ve come for you .
let' s go .
come on .
you only had one simple job , and you couldn' t even do that .
hey , marge ?
marge , over here ! we need your help !
easy with the hardware .
jesus , marge ! what the fuck ?
it' s okay , jer .
we just want the girl .
okay , tell me .
what the hell is going on here ?
i don' t know .
i don' t believe you .
all right .
i' m coming out .
throw out the gun .
please don' t don' t leave me here .
please !
hands on your head .
what ?
hands on your head .
now !
what do you want with her , marge ?
huh ? why is she so important ? just the girl .
you can kill him .
come on !
quickly !
you , i don' t need .
but you
call your people .
find them .
over here .
goddamn it !
get up !
come on .
get up !
my best friend is dead .
everyone is trying to kill us .
i just shot two cops .
why is everyone after you ?
i don' t know .
i swear .
i don' t know . why is this happening ? i know it' s my fault . i just don' t know why .
that man on the stairs , what do you know about him ?
nothing .
come on .
i saw your face .
you recognized him .
i don' t talk about it .
tell me .
i need to know .
i' ve seen him before ... in my dreams .
in your dreams ?
they' re they' re nightmares really .
he takes me , and and he makes love to me .
i' ve been making love to him my whole life .
i thought i was crazy , but he was never real before tonight .
oh , he' s real .
i' ve seen him before .
i' m afraid .
don' t be afraid .
i won' t let him do any harm to you .
i' m afraid of me .
i' m afraid that if i see him , if he tries to take me ,
i' m gonna want him to .
let' s go !
where we going ?
to get some answers .
you don' t need that .
you have no enemies here .
i' m not so sure about that .
this girl was just attacked by your people .
your vatican knights almost killed her !
vatican knights ?
oh , my god .
well , they' re not my people .
they think they' re doing god' s work .
but they' re not .
i want to know what' s going on , and i want to know right now !
put the gun away .
did anybody see you come ?
no .
good .
we should be safe here .
according to the scriptures , he can' t see inside of the house of god .
who can' t ?
maybe now you' re ready to believe .
her hands are healed .
that' s the power of faith .
who is she ?
she' s a polish peasant .
she fell into a trance about two weeks ago , and then she began to speak in a language she couldn' t possibly have known .
she made a prophecy about end of days .
" end of days " ?
of man' s destruction and the unholy' s reign upon the earth .
why don' t you stop all this church talk and tell us what the hell is going on .
who' s after her ?
well , if you' il excuse me , i' il try to explain .
you know anything about the number of the beast ?
revelation of st. john ?
from his dream ?
six six six ?
the number ofthe beast is not six six six .
often in dreams , numbers appear upside down and back wards .
so , six six six becomes nine nine nine .
like in 1 999 , the year of his return .
what does that have to do with me ?
the return of satan .
does any of this look familiar to you ?
she' s been chosen .
he' s in her blood .
the holy church has been searching for you since the day you were born .
chosen for what ?
every thousand years , on the eve of the millennium , the dark angel comes and takes a body , and then he walks the earth , looking for a woman who will bear his child .
it allhas to happen in that unholyhourbefore midnight on new year' s eve .
lf he consummates your flesh with this human body , then he unlocks the gate of hell ... and everything as we know it ceases to exist .
so , the prince of darkness wants to conquer the earth , but has to wait until an hour before midnight of new year' s eve ?
is this eastern time ?
it' s got nothing to do with new year' s eve .
it has to do with a temporary celestial alignment .
the gregorian monks studied the heavens .
they were able to calculate the precise moment of this event .
they created our calendar by mapping this event ... and counting backwards from that moment .
it was a mistake to come here .
it doesn' t matter whether you believe or not .
he' s real , and he won' t rest till he finds this girl .
why did he pick me ?
because the stars were right when you were born .
a man' s body was also chosen , just like yours .
lf the devil does exist , why doesn' t your god do anything ?
it' s not my god .
it' s our god , and he doesn' t say that he will save us .
he says that we will save ourselves .
save myself ?
what am i supposed to do ?
get a restraining order ?
we have to have faith .
faith .
yes , faith . it' s an interesting concept .
if you read the bible , you can' t miss it .
faith !
between your faith and my glock nine millimeter , i take my glock .
come on .
let' s go .
i' m afraid it takes a person of pure heart to defeat pure evil .
you did your job .
you brought her here to people of faith .
we' il protect her .
we' il hide her .
you know , you live in a different world .
we have some real serious problems here , and this is not solving them .
satan' s greatest trick was convincing man he didn' t exist .
i don' t , uh this all feels true to me .
you' il be safer with me .
at least i can fight this guy with something real .
you know what to do .
you feelit .
i' m sorry .
let him go .
it gets easier when you accept what you are .
a fallen soul .
tsk , tsk , tsk , tsk .
door' s locked , no windows broken .
how did i get in here ?
who the fuck are you ?
oh , i think you know who i am .
you just don' t want to believe it .
i took a bullet for you .
i protected you .
oh , no no no .
you didn' t protect me .
you protected this body .
am i am i getting a pattern here ?
so much pain .
not to be taken with alcohol .
remember that .
oh .
to lose a wife and child .
i can' t even imagine what that must be like .
what do you want ?
to make you happy again .
yuletide carols
beings ungby a choir
and folks dressed up like eskimos
a gift from you daughter ?
hmm ?
amy ?
don' t stayin there too long .
you' il turn into a prune .
emily !
come on , darling .
it' s time to get out .
gotta get you dressed .
your daddy' s gonna be home soon .
i have the best daddy in the whole world .
yes , you certainly do .
but i don' t think he' il be home .
now , what makes you say a silly thing like that ?
he never comes home .
well , honey, you know your daddy workshard .
it' s not about how much time you' re there .
it' s about " quality time .
now , he' il be home just like he promised .
you' il see .
he keeps his promises .
i can give it all back to you .
everything that he took away .
everything .
you can hold your wife again .
you can watch your daughter walk through the door in her prom dress .
all you have to do is tell me where the girl is .
come on .
she' s a nobody to you .
you don' t even know her .
you' re in the middle of something you don' t really understand .
you think you' re saving her from me ?
she wants to be with me .
you know that .
what did you do in school today ?
you think i' d harm her ?
i' d treat her like a queen .
turn around , sweetheart .
you told me you' do anything to get yourfamily back .
you want them ?
this is your chance .
they' re not real .
does that matter ?
oh , yes . i think you need to be reminded ... of how painful reality is .
no !
oh , shit !
don' t hurt my baby !
daddy !
let my daughter go !
daddy !
let go of my baby !
no !
oh , it' s true .
it wasn' t your fault .
i wasn' t there .
no , you were just
you were out doing your job .
i wasn' t fucking there !
oh , look at you .
torn apart by guilt .
you didn' t do anything wrong .
you were an honest cop .
you didn' t take money .
you had to testify against them even after they threatened your family .
most people would never testify against those guys .
they' re not like you .
you had to do the right thing .
and where was god , hmm ?
he could' ve stopped it , but he didn' t .
he fucked you .
then he made you feel guilty .
me , i don' t do guilt .
i didn' t do what happened here .
he did .
now you just think about that .
then you tell me who' s really your friend .
i can make it like it never happened .
all for the price of a stranger' s address .
no !
you will never see the girl !
now , you see now you' re upsetting me .
you don' t want to see me upset , believe me .
oh , you want to fuck with me ?
you think you know bad , huh ?

you' re in touch with your anger .
i really like that .
i don' t know about you , but i' m going to have a drink .
you and i are so much alike .
we' re nothing alike !
nothing !
look at yourself .
look at this .
look at what you are now .
you walked away from the light , just like me .
you want one ?
you need to get out , now .
come on .
you know what' s in your heart .
we' re on the same side .
i' m not on your side , and i never will be .
you' re on his side ?
he' s the one who took away your family .
let me tell you something about him .
he is the biggest underachiever of all time .
he just had a good publicist , that' s all .
it' s his will .
he moves in mysterious ways .
you take that that overblown press kit they call the bible .
you look for the answer in there , what do they tell you ?
shit happens .
please .
he treated you like garbage .
you walked away .
i' m not the bad guy .
what about the end of days ?
think of it as a new beginning .
a change of management .
and you' il be right there with me on the ground floor .
it will be so cool .
tell me what you want .
tell me what you really want , and i' il give it to you .
i' il tell you what i want .
i want you to go to hell .
you see , sometimes the problem is ... [ neck bones cracking ] hell ...
comes to you !
don' t fuck up the coat .
i' ve wasted too much time on this .
you see those insignifiicant little dots down there ?
huh ?
do you see them ?
that' s what you mean to me .
now , give me the girl !
not today .
look down .
now , look in your heart and tell me you don' t want to die .
