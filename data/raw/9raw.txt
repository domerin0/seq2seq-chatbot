we shall not cease from exploration ... and the end of all our exploring will be to arrive where we started ... and know the place for the first time .

man ... probably the most mysterious species on our planet .
a mystery of unanswered questions .
who are we ?
where do we come from ?
where are we going ?
how do we know what we think we know ?
why do we believe anything at all ?
countless questions in search of an answer ... an answer that will give rise to a new question ... and the next answer will give rise to the next question and so on .
but , in the end , isn' t it always the same question ?
and always the same answer ?
the ball is round .
the game lasts 90 minutes .
that' s a fact .
everything else is pure theory .
here we go !
written and directed by tom tykwer
manni ?
lola .
what' s up ?
where are you ?
where were you , damn it ?
i got there too late .
but why today ?
you' re always on time !
my moped got ripped off .
it doesn' t matter .
yes , it matters !
what' s wrong ?
it wasn' t my fault , manni .
i went to get some cigarettes .
i can' t believe how fast that guy was .
there was nothing i could do .
he was gone before i got outside .
i even took a taxi .
that dumbass drove east .
they got a grunewald st. there too .
when i noticed , it was too late .
it just didn' t occur to me .
i was so screwed up because of our moped .
doesn' t matter .
and when i got there , you were gone .
it doesn' t matter now anyway .
i' m done for .
but why ?
help me , lola !
i don' t know what to do .
you weren' t there , and i messed it up .
i blew it .
i' m such a jerk !
just calm down .
now what happened ?
just tell me what happened , okay ?
lola , he' s gonna kill me .
i' m gonna die .
stop it !
you' re scaring me .
what' s up ?
did you get caught ?
no , but that would' ve been something .
everything went really great .
we drove the cars there , and those guys came .
they paid , and that was it .
easy as pie .
i got waved across the border , and then they dropped me off out there .
then i went to see that cyclops , and he was finished in no time .
and everything was on time , except for you .
you weren' t there .
then what ?
nothing .
not even a phone booth .
i couldn' t even call a taxi , so i walked to the subway station .
on the train , there was this bum ... who somehow fell down , and suddenly these inspectors showed up .
and i got out like always an old reflex .
the bag !
the bag .
the bag !
i' m such a fucking amateur !
a dumbass !
this could only happen to me ! lf you' d picked me up , it wouldn' t have happened .
i was so out of it .
you' re always on time otherwise !
didn' t you call the next station ?
sure .
but it was too late .
the fucking bag was already gone .
and i know who has it .
that bum !
that plastic bag freak !
he' s on a plane to florida or hawaii ... or canada or hong kong or bermuda or whatever .
what about ronnie ?
he' il kill me .
you gotta tell him .
forget it !
why ?
he won' t believe a single word .
i kept a carton of cigarettes once .
he noticed right away .
he doesn' t believe anybody .
the jobs with those mercs was a kind of test ... to see if he could trust me .
how much was there , in the bag ?
100, 000 .
what ?
100, 000 .
a test .
oh , shit !
see !
i knew you wouldn' t come up with any idea .
i always said someday you wouldn' t know what to do .
not when you die , sooner !
you said , " love can do everything .
so find 100, 000 marks in 20 minutes .
20 minutes ?
at 12 : 00 by the water tower around the corner , ronnie said .
in 20 minutes .
run away , manni !
no .
why not ?
nobody escapes ronnie .
i' il go with you .
when ronnie gets here in 20 minutes , i' il be a goner .
stop it , manni !
what for ?
you can' t get me 100 grand either !
he' il rub me out , and all that' s left of me will be 100, 000 ashes ... floating down the spree to the north sea and no more manni !
you can' t do a thing !
shut up !
listen .
wait for me .
i' il help you .
stay put .
i' il be there in 20 minutes .
okay ?
gonna pawn all your jewelry ?
where are you ?
in a phone booth , downtown , in front of the spirale bar .
okay , stay where you are .
i promise i' il come up with something .
in 20 minutes , okay ?
what the hell .
i' il go over to the bolle and get that 100 grand .
cut it out !
ronnie said they make 200 grand a day , so they must have 100 grand by noon .
you' re nuts !
don' t do a thing !
just stay in the damned booth !
i' m coming .
that' s it .
i' il rob the store .
are you cracked ?
don' t do a thing !
stay put !
i' m coming .
then what ?
i' il think of something !
in 20 minutes i' il be dead unless i steal the money !
no , wait !
what for ?
i' il get the money somehow .
i' m going in there at 12 : 00 , if you aren' t here .
okay !
who ?
who ?
dad !
lola , are you going shopping ?
i need shampoo .
of course , i knew that sagittarius was your ascendant .
sure , the more i think about it , i don' t know .
yeah , but you' re married too .
hey !
get your eyes open !
you bitch .
and then
it' s worst at night .
i wake up and can' t fall asleep again .
and then i' m afraid .
me !
afraid of the dark .
i' ve never been afraid of the dark .
i' ve never been afraid before .
but i think about us ...
and i just think it' il keep going on like this .
and you wouldn' t dare
and then i ask myself what i' m doing here .
how long will this go on ?
the secrecy , all this damned lying ?
should i grow old , waiting for a man who won' t stand by me ?
hey !
you need a bike ?
50 marks , as good as new .

and then

sure you would .
what else could you do ?

not a bad idea .
and everybody' s real compassionate ... and everything' s so incredibly sad , and everyone feels sorry for you .
you can show everyone how strong you are .
what a great woman , " they' il say .
she really pulls herself together instead of crying all day .
and all at once this really nice guy with green eyes shows up .
and he' s super sensitive , listens to you all day .
and you can talk his ear off .
and you can tell him how tough things are for you ... and that you have to look after yourself and don' t know what" s gonna happen ... and blah , blah , blah .
then you' d hop onto his lap and cross me off your list .
that' s how it goes .
manni .
