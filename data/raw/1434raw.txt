#### [ playing the blues ]
d' oh !
would you turn off that rock ' n ' rock music ?
don' t have a stegosaurus , man .
these talking dinosaurs are more real ... than most real families on tv .
ooh !
ooh !
ooh !
look , maggie , they have a baby too .
it' s like they saw our lives and put it up on screen .
kids , i know you' re excited ... about meeting aunt selma' s boyfriend .
before he gets here ...
i should tell you something about him something disturbing .
ooh !
ooh !
ee ugh !
aunt selma has this crazy obsession ... about not dying alone ... so in desperation ... she joined this prison pen pal program .
her new sweetie is a jailbird .
cool , he can teach us ... how to kill a man with a lunch tray .
now , now , he' s an ex convict .
he' s paid his debt to society .
then why aren' t you using ... the good silverware ?
i' m just not .
that' s them .
remember , everyone ... be understanding and forgiving ... for the sake of family unity .
everyone ...
i' d like you to meet
aah !
it' s sideshow bob !
what the .. ?
i' m afraid their reaction is understandable .
bart is the shamus in short pants who sent me to prison .
your new boyfriend here framed krusty the clown ...
for armed robbery .
if some snot nosed little kid sent me to prison ... the first thing out i' d find out where he lives ... and tear him a new belly button .
lousy snitch .
yaah !
you' re forgetting the first two noble truths ... of the buddha .
i am not .
yes , you are .
one : existence is suffering .
two : the cause of suffering is desire in this case , my desire to do high quality ... children' s programming .
when prison ended that dream , i became a seething cauldron ... of rage and recrimination .
when i was nominated for best supporting performer ... in a children ' s program at the daytime emmy awards ... my bitterness ruined the greatest night of my life .
droopy drawers ...
colonel coward ...
pepito , the biggest cat in the whole wide world ...
sideshow bob ... and suckup the vacuum .
and the emmy goes to ...
i don' t believe this ...
sideshow bob .
this is one more emmy than you' il ever win ... you bantering jack in the box !
just don' t drop it in the shower .
no talent , shill !
second banana !
panderer !
bore !
uh , now for the highlight of the evening
best film to video transfer .
do you know what prison is like ... for a life long republican ?
in our overcrowded cell we became little more than beasts .
who used my chap stick ?
oh , i did .
here you go .
i don' t want it .
my only joy came with plotting a horrible revenge ... against the boy who put me there .
ay , caramba !
bart , if i wanted to kill you ...
i' d have choked you as soon as i walked in .
but what kind of guest would i have been ?
now , where was i ?
ah , yes my lowest ebb .
you can' t take my emmy .
you know the rules : awards for entertainment are contraband .
no emmys , no oscars , not even a golden globe .
but kismet be kind , well as cruel .
i received an answer to my letter ... from the prison pen pal program .
dear # 2 460 1 ...
i need a man and cannot find one ...
among the law abiding .
i have a steady job and a lucrative hobby :: " filing nuisance lawsuits .
i share an apartment with my twin sister .
enclosed is a photo of us on a tandem bike .
i forget which one i am .
dear selma ...
' ' your latest letter set off a riot ... in the maximum security wing of my heart .
ohhh ...
like the lone crocus that pokes through the prison yard ... our love bloomed despite all obstacles .
selma , may i ?
uh , uh , uh ... on the cheek .
inspired by the love of a good woman ...
i resolved to be the best darned inmate # 2 460 1 i could be .
i bade farewell to my cellmates ... and left with the woman i loved .
cutter .
icepick .
snake .
i' m going to miss you most of all .
aww !
what a beautiful story , sideshow bob .
you' re living proof that our revolving door prison system works .
i' ve never seen you so happy giggling like a schoolgirl .
i' ve got to admit it , selma ... he' s a once in a lifetime catch .
i hope the police are saying that as well .
i can' t believe you guys .
this man framed krusty the clown .
bart !
indeed , i did ... and i thank you for catching me .
you seized the wheel ... of my slow boat to hell , and pointed it ... towards the sunny shores of selma .
here , here .
would you mind ... if i did something bold and shocking ... in front of your family ?
all right , but no tongues .
though kissing you is like kissing some divine ashtray ... that' s not what i had in mind .
selma , will you marry me ?
don' t be a fool .
that man is scum .
then call me " mrs. scum .
161 ]
could you ... pumice my corns for me ?
avec plaisir .
a " ...

close enough .
may you drive safely ... and find true love .
we now return to ... [ skipped item nr .
170 ]
whoo hoo !
i love you people !
i love my kids !
poor little guys .
so tragic .
so nauseous .
you should see the bus they came to the studio in .
what' s next ?
oh , yeah .
and now , a man who needs no introduction ...
the chairman of the company " you know who i' m talking about .
get out here , you gumba !
182 ] who wants to say hello .
huh ?
what ?
i can ' t believe it !
they ' ve been feuding for years .
come here , you .
oh , you old clown , you .
i missed you .
this guy is a national treasure .
that jerk i got to replace you , he isn' t fit to hold your slide whistle .
all i can be is myself .
krusty , can you ever forgive me for putting you in jail ?
if they open the books on this telethon i' m right back in there .
that sideshow bob is a no good show biz phony .
come on , bart.
if krusty can find it in his heart to forgive him surely you can too .
196 ]
now , about your wedding dress ... how should i put this ?
white !
white .
what would you like for appetizers ?
ooh , appetizers .
homer , you' re a trencherman .
what should we serve ?
well , you can' t go wrong with cocktail weenies .
they taste as good as they look ... and they come in this delicious red sauce .
it looks like ketchup , it tastes like ketchup ... but , brother , it ain' t ketchup !
selma , he makes a good case .
whatever you want .
it all tastes like styrofoam to me .
selma , dear , i' m confused .
when i was a kid ... we were playing with bottle rockets ... and one shot straight up my nose .
i permanently lost my sense of taste and smell .
okay , we' ve got cocktail weenies and swedish meatballs .
selma , this wedding is spinning out of control .
i' ve run through eight of the ten dollars ... they gave me when i left prison .
i told you i got money .
i bought stock in a mace company ... just before society crumbled .
selma , that' s wonderful !
i hope people don' t think ...
i ' m marrying you for your money ... instead of your ...
less tangible qualities .
tomorrow we' il be mr. and mrs. bob terwilliger .
isn' t it grand ?
hey , bob , give some of that honey this way .
mmm ... mmm !
holy frijoles !
we' ve got ten minutes till macgyver .
driver , here' s a fin .
get me home , and don' t spare the whip .
whatever you say , mum .
what did i miss ?
macgyver was wearing a tank top .
dang .
but i' m the only man in your life .
sit down and shut up !
seor macgyver , you saved our village .
don ' t thank me .
thank the moon ' s gravitational pull .
that macgyver' s a genius .
first of all , he' s not a genius .
he' s an actor .
and second , he' s not much of an actor .
you' re lying .
you' re lying !
no , this is lying that was a well plotted piece of non claptrap ... that never made me retch .
no !
he was so cruel .
the things he said ... they' re just not true .
there .
there .
the wedding' s off .
fiddle dee dee .
tomorrow' s another day .
bart , stop that !
no , he' s right .
we' re a package .
love me , love macgyver .
i guess the wedding' s off .
selma , i don' t know what to say .
just tell me you like macgyver .
very well .
i i
i can' t do it !
even that car chase seemed tacked on .
would you two knock it off ?
i hate all the programs marge likes ... but it' s no big deal .
you know why ?
no .
go on .
whenever marge puts on ... one of her nonviolent programs , i take a walk .
i go to a bar , i pound a few ... then i stumble home in the mood for love .
very well , selma .
whenever you watch macgyver ...
i' il take a vigorous constitutional ... and return more in love than ever .
oh , bob .
bart no like .
bad medicine .
i could have been the flower girl ... and i wouldn' t keep falling down either .
hey , they chose maggie , okay ?
if you want to go for cutesyness ... instead of competence , fine .
do you , bob , take selma ... to have and to hold , in sickness and in health ... till death do you part ?
293 ]
mmm .
oh .
hey , wiener boy ... where do you think you ' re going ?
i' m the only single girl left in the family .
well , i guess it could be worse .
oh , there' s krusty the clown .
krusty !
krusty , say something funny .
oh , gee , a joke , huh ?
um ... uh ... funny .
okay , this guy walks into a bar ... and takes out a tiny piano and a 1 2 inch pianist
oh , no , wait .
i can' t tell that one .
dear friends , 41 years ago ...
god took 1 68 pounds of clay , and he made me a woman ... and for this , i thank him .
i just wanted to say ... on the advice of my new husband ...
i' ve decided to give up smoking ... [ cheering ]
except for after meals and after macgyver .
selma , dear , you' il bury us all .
chief wiggum , you' ve been around .
you don' t trust sideshow bob , do you ?
lighten up , son .
if he was going to commit a crime ... would he have invited the number one cop in town ?
now , where did i put my gun ?
oh , yeah .
i set it down when i got some cake .
i don' t know what to say .
just tell me what you know i want to hear .
i' m dying of jealousy .
thank you .
that' s right , dear .
enjoy your rest .
the wedding was very tough on you ... and the honeymoon is going to be ... murder .
welcome to our video honeymoon .
we' re using the video camera cousin doug gave us ... and the videocassette homer gave us .
hey , and after we watch this , we can tape over it .
there' s shelbyville falls , rolling rock ... and here' s another breathtaking sight ... my brand new hubby .
i wanted a room with a fireplace ... you brainless luggage monkey !
like the one in your brochure !
oh , selma , dear .
i was just chatting with my good friend ...
dennis .
now , smile for the camera , that' s a good lad .
ah , fire
scourge of prometheus , toaster of marshmallows ... eradicator of deadwood .
oh , selma , dear you and your little camera .
what do you say we shut it off for a while ?
and make love ?
i suppose so .
oh , that ' s sweet .
why would sideshow bob go so nuts over a fireplace ?
because he wants his honeymoon ... to be romantic .
romantic ?
with aunt selma ?
i guess you' re too young to understand .
hmm ... [ selma moaning ]
bob , one of my fillings fell out .
even murder has its ugly side .
bob , would you mind rubbing my feet ?
darling , you make it sound like a chore .
ooh .
oh .
good .
mmm .
soon i will kill you .
huh ?
son pieds sentit beau
french for " her foot smells lovely .
oh .
prepare to be murdered .
huh ?
that' s ...
sanskrit for " your toes are like perfume .
voy a matar a usted .
wha ?
that' s spanish for " i am going to kill you .
say what ?
i do believe it' s time ... for your beloved macgyver .
oh , hey , you' re right .
well , time for my walk .
mm .
don' t forget to die .
ding dong .
i was feeling kind of lonely without selma .
mind if i watch tvwith you ?
oh , go ahead , patty .
tonight , on macgyver ...
macgyver ...
macgyver ...
macgyver ...
aunt selma has one hour to live .
hey , down in front .
good bye .
front desk , there' s been a terrible accident in my room !
poor selma .
you were having ... such a lovely evening ...
404 ]
selma !
oh !
you tried to kill me .
i want a separation .
my best laid plans have gang agley .
do you have room in your jail ... for a two time loser ?
no , but that never stopped us before .
bart , i must know ... how did you untangle my web ?
yeah , bart , clue us in .
i' d hate to tell the number one cop in town ... how to do his job .
no , please , it' s the only way i' il learn .
all right .
sideshow bob seemed desperate ... to get that fireplace , but why ?
then it hit me
the gas !
surely anyone would have noticed a gas leak ... except aunt selma .
i permanently lost my sense of smell .
she happily watched macgyver ... unaware that her room ... was silently filling with natural gas .
all it needed to explode ... was a single spark , say , from a cigarette .
i ' ve decided ... to give up smoking ... except after meals and macgyver .
her only hope was a plucky young boy and his slow witted father .
when aunt selma lights up after macgyver ... she' il be blown to kingdom come .
come again ?
after trying four times to explain it to homer ...
i explained it to mom and we were on our way !
to the simpson mobile !
443 ]
but wait .
if you saved selma , why did the room explode ?
oh , i' il field that one .
446 ]
oh , right , the gas .
448 ]
with all my criminal buddies !
i feel like such a fool .
well , he fooled almost everyone ... but there was one little boy who never lost his mistrust .
thanks , mom .
now , let' s get out of this gas filled hallway ...
before we all suffocate .
shh .
