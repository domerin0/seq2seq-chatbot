do you have any idea what they were arguing about ?
do you speak english ?
yeah .
no .
i' m sorry , my german is not very good .
have you heard that as couples age ... ... they lose their ability to hear each other ?
no .
supposedly , men lose their ability to hear high pitched sounds ... ... and women lose hearing in the low end .
i guess they nullify each other .
i guess .
nature' s way of allowing couples to grow old together ... ... without killing each other .
what are you reading ?
oh , yeah .
how about you ?
i was thinking about going to the lounge car .
would you like to come with me ?
yeah .
okay .
how do you speak such good english ?
i went to school for a summer in los angeles .
it' s fine here ?
yeah , this is good .
and i spent some time in london .
wow .
how do you speak such good english ?
me ?
i' m american .
you' re american ?
are you sure ?
yeah .
no , i' m joking .
i knew you were american .
and you don' t speak any other language , right ?
yeah , yeah .
i get it , i get it .
i' m the crude , dumb , vulgar american ... ... who doesn' t speak other languages , who has no culture .
but i tried .
i took french in high school .
when i first got to paris ... ... i stood in line at the metro station .
i was practicing .
whatever .
and i get up there , and i look at this woman ... ... and my mind goes blank .
and i say , " i need a ticket to get to ...
so anyway ...
so where are you headed ?
well , back to paris .
my classes start next week .
you' re still in school ?
where ?
la sorbonne .
you know ?
sure .
you' re coming from budapest ?
i was visiting my grandmother .
oh .
how is she ?
she' s okay .
she' s all right ?
she' s fine .
how about you ?
where are you going ?
i' m going to vienna .
vienna ?
what' s there ?
no idea .
i' m flying out of there tomorrow .
you' re on holiday ?
i don' t really know what i' m on .
you know ?
i' ve just been traveling around , riding trains for two or three weeks .
you were visiting friends or just on your own ?
i had a friend in madrid , but ...
madrid , that' s nice .
i got a eurail pass ... ... is what i did .
that' s great .
so has this trip around europe been good for you ?
yeah , sure .
it' s been ...
it sucked .
what ?
it' s had its ...
i' il tell you , sitting for weeks on end looking out the window ... ... has actually been kind of great .
what do you mean ?
well , you know , for instance ... ... you have ideas that you ordinarily wouldn' t have .
what kind of ideas ?
want to hear one ?
tell me .
all right .
i have this idea , okay , for a television show .
some friends of mine are cable access producers .
do you know what that is ?
anybody can produce a show real cheap , and they have to put it on .
i have this idea for a show that lasts 24 hours a day for a year straight .
what you do is you get ... ... 365 people from cities all over the world ... ... to do these 24 hour documents of real time .
capturing life as it' s lived .
you know , it would start with a guy waking up in the morning ... ... and taking the long shower ... ... eating a little breakfast , making a little coffee ... ... reading the paper ...
wait .
all those mundane , boring things ... ... everybody has to do every day of their fucking life ?
i was going to say , " the poetry of day to day life .
you say it your way .
i' il say it my way .
think of it like this ...
who' s gonna watch ?
think about it like this .
why is it that a dog sleeping in the sun ... ... is so beautiful ?
it is .
it' s beautiful .
but a guy taking money from a bank machine ... ... looks like a complete moron ?
so it' s like a national geographic program , but on people .
yeah .
what do you think ?
yeah , i can see it .
like , 24 boring hours ...
sorry ... ... and a three minute sex scene where he falls asleep right after .
yeah , and that would be a great episode .
people would talk about that episode .
you and your friends could do one in paris if you wanted .
i don' t know .
the key , the thing that haunts me is the distribution .
getting these tapes from town to town so it would play continuously .
because it would have to play all the time , or it just wouldn' t work .
thank you .
thanks .
you know what ?
not service oriented .
just an observation about europe .
my parents never really spoke of the possibility ... ... of my falling in love or getting married or having children .
even as a little girl ... ... they wanted me to think as a future career as a , you know ... ... interior designer or lawyer or something like that .
i' d say to my dad , " i want to be a writer .
and he' d say , " journalist .
i' d say i wanted to have a refuge for stray cats .
he' d say , " veterinarian .
i' d say i wanted to be an actress .
he' d say , " tv newscaster .
it was this constant conversion of my fanciful ambition into these ... ... practical moneymaking ventures .
i had a good bullshit detector when i was a kid .
i always knew when they were lying to me .
by high school , i was dead set ... ... on listening to what everybody thought i should do with my life ... ... and doing the opposite .
nobody was ever mean about it .
i just could never get very excited ... ... about other people' s ambitions for my life .
but you know what ?
if your parents never ... ... fully contradict you about anything and are nice and supportive ...
right . ... it makes it even harder to officially complain .
even when they' re wrong , it' s this passive aggressive shit .
you know what i mean ?
i hate it .
i really hate it .
well , you know , despite all that kind of bullshit ... ... that comes along with it ... ... i remember childhood as ... ... this magical time .
i do .
i remember when my mother first told me about death .
my great grandmother had died , and my family had visited them in florida .
i was about 3 , 31/ 2 years old .
anyway , i was in the back yard playing ... ... and my sister had just taught me how to take the garden hose ... ... and do it in such a way that ... ... it sprayed into the sun and would make a rainbow .
and so i was doing that ... ... and through the mist , i could see my grandmother .
and she was just standing there , smiling at me .
and i held it there for a long time ... ... and i looked at her .
and then finally , i let go of the nozzle , you know ?
and then i dropped the hose ... ... and she disappeared .
and so i run back inside and tell my parents .
and they sit me down and give me this big rap on how ... ... when people die , you never see them again , and how i' d imagined it .
but i knew what i' d seen .
i was glad i saw that .
i' ve never seen anything like that since .
but i don' t know .
it just kind of let me know how ambiguous everything was .
even death .
you' re lucky you can have this attitude toward death .
i think i' m afraid of death 24 hours a day .
i swear .
i mean , that' s why i' m in a train right now .
i could' ve flown to paris , but i' m scared .
oh , come on .
i can' t help it .
i know the statistics say , " na , na , na , it' s safer . " whatever .
when i' m in a plane , i can see the explosion .
i can see me falling through the clouds .
and i' m so scared of those few seconds of consciousness ... ... before you die .
when you know you' re gonna die .
i can' t stop thinking that way .
it' s exhausting .
yeah , i bet .
really exhausting .
i think this is vienna .
yeah .
you get off here , no ?
yeah , what a drag .
i wish i' d met you earlier .
i really like talking to you .
yeah , me too .
it was really nice of you too .
i have an admittedly insane idea , but if i don' t ask you this ... ... it' il haunt me the rest of my life .
what ?
i want to keep talking to you .
i have no idea what your situation is ... ... but i feel like we have some kind of ... ... connection .
right ?
yeah .
me too .
right .
great .
here' s the deal .
get off here in vienna and come check out the town .
what ?
come on .
it' il be fun .
come on .
what would we do ?
i don' t know .
all i know is i catch a flight tomorrow morning at 9 : 30 ... ... and i can' t afford a hotel , so i was going to walk around ... ... and it' d be more fun if you came with me .
and if i turn out to be a psycho , just get on the next train .
all right , all right .
think of it like this .
jump ahead 10 , 20 years , okay ?
and you' re married .
only your marriage doesn' t have that same energy it used to have .
you start to blame your husband .
you think about all those guys you' ve met in your life ... ... and what might' ve happened if you' d picked up with one of them .
i' m one of those guys .
that' s me .
so think of this as time travel ... ... from then to now to find out what you' re missing out on .
what this could be is a gigantic favor ... ... to you and your husband to find out you' re not missing anything .
i' m just as big a loser as he is .
unmotivated .
boring .
you made the right choice .
you' re happy .
let me get my bag .
we should get a locker for all this .
what' s your name ?
my name ?
jesse .
james , actually , but everybody calls me jesse .
you mean , jesse james , no ?
no .
no , just jesse .
i' m celine .
this is a nice bridge .
yeah .
this is kind of weird .
isn' t it ?
i mean , i feel a little awkward .
but it' s all right .
right ?
yeah , this is great .
let' s go to some places .
yeah , let' s go to some places .
let' s ask these guys .
okay .
excuse me .
excuse me ?
sprechen sie english ?
ja .
of course .
do you speak german for a change ?
what ?
no , it was a joke .
we just got into vienna today , and we' re looking for something fun to do .
like museums , exhibitions ...
but museums are not that funny anymore these days .
they are closing right now .
how long are you going to be here ?
just for tonight .
why did you come to vienna ?
what could you be expecting ?
we' re on honeymoon .
yeah , she got pregnant , we had to get married ...
i don' t believe you .
you' re a bad liar .
this is a play we' re both in .
we would like to invite you .
you' re actors ?
not professional .
part time for fun .
it' s a play about a cow and indians searching for it .
there are also politicians , mexicans ...
russians , communists ...
you have a real cow on stage ?
no , an actor in a cow costume .
he' s the cow .
yes , i am the cow .
and the cow' s a bit weird .
the cow has a disease .
she' s acting a bit strange .
like a dog .
if someone throws a stick , she fetches it .
and she can smoke with hoofs and everything .
great .
as you see , there is the address .
it' s in the second district .
near the prater .
you know it ?
the big ferris wheel ?
we should go .
we should .
perhaps you can go to the prater before the play .
it starts at 2130 .
2130 ?
it' s at 9 : 30 .
9 : 30 .
oh , right .
what' s the name of this play ?
it translates as " bring me the horns of wilmington' s cow .
i' m wilmington' s cow .
all right .
great .
you' il be there ?
we' il try .
i' m the cow .
goodbye .
i got an idea .
are you ready ?
it' s q and a time .
we' ve known each other a little while .
we' re stuck together , so we' il ask each other a few direct questions .
all right ?
we ask each other questions ?
and you have to answer honestly .
of course .
okay .
all right , first question .
you .
yes , i am going to ask you .
describe for me your first sexual feelings ... ... towards a person .
my first sexual feelings ?
oh , my god .
i know .
i know .
jean marc fleury .
jean marc fleury ?
we were at this summer camp together , and he was a swimmer .
he had bleached out chlorine hair and green eyes ... ... and to improve his times , he' d shave his legs and arms .
that' s disgusting .
he was like this gorgeous dolphin .
my friend emma had a big crush on him .
so one day , i was cutting across the field back to my room ... ... and he came walking up beside me .
i told him ... ... " you should date emma .
she has a big crush on you .
and he turned to me and said ... ... " well , that' s too bad , because i have a big crush on you .
so , yeah , it really scared the hell out of me ... ... because i thought he was so fine .
then he officially asked me on a date .
i pretended i didn' t like him .
you know , i was so afraid of what i might do , you know .
so i went to see him swim a few times at the competition .
and he was so sexy .
really .
i mean , really sexy .
we wrote these little declarations of love at the end of the summer ... ... and , you know , promised we would keep writing forever ... ... and meet again very soon and ...
did you ?
of course not .
then this is the opportune time to tell you i' m a fantastic swimmer .
really ?
yeah .
i make note of that .
okay .
so it' s my turn .
no ?
yes , your turn .
hit me .
have you ever been in love ?
yes .
next question .
what was the ...
wait a minute .
so i can give one word answers ?
why not ?
after i went into detail about my sexual feelings ?
they' re different questions .
i could answer the sexual feelings thing .
but , you know , love ...
i mean , what if i asked you about love ?
i would have lied , but at least i would have made up a great story .
love is a complex issue , you know ?
i mean , yes , i' ve told somebody that i love them , and i' ve meant it .
but was it totally unselfish , giving love ?
was it a beautiful thing ?
not really .
you know , it' s like , love ...
i mean , i don' t know .
you know ?
yeah .
i know what you mean .
but as far as sexual feelings go ... ... it started with an obsessive relationship ... ... with miss july , 1978 .
do you know playboy magazine ?
i' ve heard of it .
you know crystal ?
you don' t know crystal ?
well , i knew crystal .
is it my turn now ?
tell me something that really pisses you off .
really drives you crazy .
pisses me off .
god , everything pisses me off .
list a couple .
oh , i know .
i hate being told by strange men ... ... strange men in the street ... ... you know , to smile to make them feel better about their boring life .
what else ?
i hate ...
i hate that 300 kilometers from here , there' s a war ... ... people are dying , and nobody knows what to do .
or they don' t give a shit .
i don' t know .
i hate that the media' s trying to control our minds .
the media ?
yeah , the media .
it' s very subtle , but it' s a new form of fascism , really .
i hate ...
i hate when i' m in a foreign country , especially in america ... ... each time i wear black or lose my temper or say anything about anything ... ... they always go , " oh , it' s so french .
it' s so cute .
i hate that .
i can' t stand that .
really .
is that all ?
well , there' s a lot of things , but ...
so it' s my turn .
okay .
you' re gonna answer .
yes , i' il answer .
what' s a problem for you ?
you , probably .
what ?
i had a thought the other day that kind of ... ... qualifies as a problem .
what is it ?
it was a thought i had on the train , so ...
okay .
all right .
do you believe in reincarnation ?
yeah .
yeah , it' s interesting .
a lot of people talk about past lives and things like that , you know ?
and even if they don' t believe in it in some specific way ... ... people have a notion of an eternal soul .
yeah .
okay .
50, 000 years ago ... ... there' s not even a million people .
ten thousand years ago , there' s , like , two million people .
now there' s between five and six billion people on the planet .
if we all have our own ... ... individual , unique ... ... soul ... ... where did they all come from ?
are modern souls only a fraction of the original souls ?
if they are , that represents a 5000 to 1 split of each soul ... ... in the last 50, 000 years , which is a blip in the earth' s time .
so at best , we' re these tiny fractions ... ... of people walking ...
is that why we' re so scattered ?
is that why we' re so specialized ?
wait a minute , i' m not sure ...
yeah , i know , i know .
it' s a totally scattered thought .
which is kind of why it makes sense .
i agree with you .
let' s get off this damn train .
this place is pretty neat .
yeah .
there' s even a listening booth .
have you heard of this singer ?
i think she' s american .
a friend told me about her .
do you want to go see if that listening booth still works ?
yeah , okay .
there' s a wind that blows in from the north
and it says that loving takes this course
come here
come here
no , i' m not impossible to touch
i have never wanted you so much
come here
come here
have i never laid down by your side
baby , let' s forget about this pride
come here
come here
look at this .
this is beautiful .
quick .
it' s leaving .
look , there' s a rabbit .
yeah .
hey there , rabbit .
it' s so cute .
i visited this as a young teenager .
it left a bigger impression on me at that time than the museums .
yeah ?
it' s tiny .
i know .
a little old man talked to us .
he was the groundskeeper .
he explained that most of the people buried here ... ... had washed up on the bank of the danube .
how old are these ?
around the beginning of the century .
it' s called no name cemetery ... ... because they often didn' t know who those people were .
maybe a first name , that' s all .
why were all the bodies washing up ?
i think some were from accidents on boats and things like that .
but most of them were suicides that jumped in the river .
i always liked the idea of all those unknown people lost in the world .
when i was a little girl , i thought ... ... if none of your family or friends knew you were dead ... ... then it' s like not really being dead .
people can invent the best and the worst for you .
here she is , i think .
yeah , this is the one i remember the most .
she was only 13 when she died .
that meant something to me .
i was that age when i first saw this .
now i' m 10 years older , and she' s still 13 , i guess .
that' s funny .
that' s the danube over there .
that' s a river , right ?
yeah .
this is ... ... gorgeous .
yeah , this is beautiful .
i mean , we got ...
we got a sunset here .
yeah .
we got the ferris wheel .
it seems like ... ... this would be a ...
what ?
you know ...
are you trying to say you want to kiss me ?
but you know what ?
it doesn' t matter what generation you' re born into .
look at my parents .
they were angry , young may ' 68 people revolting against everything .
the government , their conservative catholic backgrounds ...
then i was born , and my father became a successful architect .
we traveled around the world while he built bridges ... ... and , you know , towers and stuff .
i mean , i really can' t complain about anything .
they love me more than anything ... ... and i' ve been raised with all the freedom they fought for .
and yet , for me now , it' s another type of fight .
we have to deal with the same shit , but we can' t really know ... ... who or , you know , what the enemy is .
i don' t know if there really is an enemy .
everybody' s parents fucked them up .
rich kids ' parents gave them too much .
poor kids ' , not enough .
too much attention , not enough attention .
they either left or taught them the wrong things .
my parents are just two people who didn' t like each other much ... ... who got married and had a kid .
and they tried their best to be nice to me .
did your parents divorce ?
yeah , finally .
they should have done it sooner .
they stuck together ... ... for the well being of my sister and i. thank you very much .
i remember my mother told me right in front of my father ... ... that he didn' t really want to have me .
that he was pissed off when he found out she was pregnant .
that i was a big mistake .
that really shaped the way i think .
i always saw the world as this place where i really wasn' t meant to be .
that' s so sad .
well , i mean , i eventually kind of took pride in it .
you know , like my life was my own doing .
you know , like i was crashing the big party .
that' s the way to see it .
my parents are still married and i guess they' re happy .
but i think it' s healthy to rebel against everything that came before .
you know , i' ve been wondering lately ... ... do you know anyone who' s in a happy relationship ?
yeah , sure .
you know , i know happy couples .
but i think they lie to each other .
yeah .
people can live their whole life as a lie .
my grandmother was married ... ... and i thought she had an uncomplicated love life .
but she just confessed to me that she spent her whole life ... ... dreaming about another man she was in love with .
she just accepted her fate .
it' s so sad .
in the same time , i love that she had these emotions ... ... and feelings i never thought she had .
i guarantee you it was better that way .
if she' d known him , he' d have disappointed her eventually .
how do you know ?
i know .
i know .
people put romantic projections on everything .
it' s not based in any kind of reality .
romantic projections ?
oh , mr. romantic up in the ferris wheel ?
oh , kiss me .
the sunset .
oh , it' s so beautiful .
tell me about your grandmother .
what were you saying about her ?
check these guys out .
hans , i have a confession .
i' m not wearing underwear underneath this .
oh , really ?
does that frighten you ?
can i tell you a secret ?
yeah .
come here .
what ?
come here .
look at this palm reader .
she' s interesting looking .
yeah .
uh oh .
uh oh .
what ?
i made eye contact .
she' s not coming over here .
yes , she is .
oh , shit .
oh , no .
you want your palm read ?
no .
are you sure ?
i' m sure .
okay .
hello .
oh , here she is .
i want your palm read .
yeah .
how much is it ?
for you , 50 .
okay ?
okay .
so you have been on a journey ... ... and you' re a stranger to this place .
you are ... ... an adventurer .
a seeker .
an adventurer in your mind .
you are interested in the power of the woman .
in the woman' s deep strength and creativity .
you' re becoming this woman .
you need to resign yourself to the awkwardness of life .
only if you find peace within yourself ... ... will you find true connection with others .
that is a stranger to you ?
i guess so .
you will be all right .
he' s learning .
okay .
money .
you' re both stars .
don' t forget .
when the stars exploded billions of years ago ... ... they formed everything that is this world .
everything we know is stardust .
so don' t forget , you are stardust .
that' s very nice and all .
i mean , that we' re all stardust ... ... and you' re becoming this great woman .
but i hope you don' t take that any more seriously ... ... than some horoscope in a newspaper .
what ?
she knew i was on vacation and that we didn' t know each other ... ... and that i was going to become this great woman .
but what was that " i am learning " bullshit ?
that' s way condescending , you know ?
i mean , she wasn' t even doing me .
i mean , if opportunists like that ever had to tell the real truth ... ... it would put them out of business .
just once , i' d love to see some little old lady save up all her money ... ... to go to the fortuneteller .
she' d get there and the woman would say ... ... " tomorrow and all your remaining days ... ... will be exactly like today ... ... a tedious collection of hours .
and you will have no new passions and no new thoughts ... ... and no new travels .
and when you die , you' il be completely forgotten .
fifty schillings , please .
that i' d like to see .
it' s so funny how ... ... she almost didn' t notice you .
it' s weird .
i wonder why .
she was really wise and intense .
i really loved what she said .
you pay your money to hear what makes you feel good about yourself .
maybe there' s a seedy section of vienna .
we can buy a hit of crack .
would you like that ?
you' re so ...
stardust .
stardust .
there' s an exhibition .
i guess we' il miss it .
it doesn' t start until next week .
yeah , i think so .
i actually saw this one in a museum .
i stared and stared at it .
must have been 45 minutes .
i love it .
la voie ferre .
it' s great .
i love the way the people are dissolving into the background .
look at this .
it' s like the environments ... ... are stronger than the people .
his human figures are always so transitory .
it' s funny .
transitory ?
transitory .
you think this is open ?
i don' t know .
let' s try it .
i was in an old church like this ... ... with my grandmother a few days ago in budapest .
even though i reject most of the religious thing ... ... i can' t help but feeling for those people that come here ... ... lost or in pain , guilt ... ... looking for some kind of answers .
it fascinates me how a single place can join pain and happiness ... ... of so many generations .
you' re close with your grandmother ?
yeah .
i think it' s because i always have this strange feeling ... ... that i' m this very old woman laying down , about to die .
you know , that my life is just ... ... her memories or something .
that' s so wild .
i always think that i' m still this 13 year old boy ... ... who doesn' t really know how to be an adult , pretending to ... ... live my life , taking notes for when i' il really have to do it .
like i' m in a dress rehearsal for a junior high play .
that' s funny .
then up there in the ferris wheel , it was like ... ... this very old woman kissing this very young boy .
right ?
do you know anything about the quakers , the quaker religion ?
no , not much .
well , i went to this quaker wedding once ... ... and it was fantastic .
what they do is ... ... the couple comes in and they kneel in front of the whole congregation ... ... and they stare at each other .
nobody says a word unless they feel that god moves them to speak ... ... or say something .
and then , after an hour or so of just ... ... staring at each other ... ... they' re married .
that' s beautiful .
i like that .
this is a horrible story .
what ?
it' s not the appropriate place to tell it .
well , i was driving around with this buddy of mine .
he' s a big atheist , you know .
and he came to a stop next to this homeless guy .
my buddy takes out a $ 100 bill ... ... and leans out the window ... ... and he says , " do you believe in god ?
and the guy looks at my friend , he looks at the money .
he says ... ... " yes , i do .
my friend says , " wrong answer .
we drove away .
that' s mean .
would you be in paris by now if you hadn' t gotten off the train ?
no , not yet .
what would you be doing ?
i' d probably be hanging around the airport ... ... crying in my coffee because you didn' t come with me .
i' d probably gotten off the train in salzburg with someone else .
oh , yeah ?
oh , i see .
so i' m just a dumb american ... ... momentarily decorating your blank canvas , huh ?
i' m having a great time .
really ?
me too .
i' m glad , because no one knows i' m here .
i don' t know anyone that would tell me ... ... all those bad things you' ve done .
i' il tell you some .
yeah , i' m sure .
you hear so much shit about people .
i always feel like ... ... the general of an army when i start dating .
plotting my strategy and maneuverings ... ... knowing his weak points , what would hurt him , seduce him .
it' s horrible .
if we were always around each other ... ... what would be the first thing about me that would drive you mad ?
no .
i' m not going to answer this question .
i dated this girl once who used to always ask me that .
what about me bugs you ?
finally i said , " i don' t think you handle criticism too well .
she flew into a rage and broke up with me .
that' s true .
all she wanted was to have an excuse ... ... to tell me what she thought was wrong with me .
is that what you want ?
something about me bugs you ?
what is it about me bugs you ?
nothing at all .
if it had to be something , what would it be ?
if it had to be something , if i had to think about it ... ... i kind of didn' t really like this reaction at the palm reader .
you were like this rooster prick .
what the hell is a rooster prick ?
you were like a boy whining ... ... because all the attention wasn' t focused on him .
all right , listen .
this woman robs you blind , okay ?
you were like a boy walking by an ice cream store ... ... crying because his mom won' t buy him a milk shake .
i don' t care what this charlatan has to say about ...
what ?
i understand a little , but he doesn' t at all .
may i ask you a question ?
so i would like to make a deal with you .
i mean , instead of just asking you for money , i will ask you for a word .
you give me a word , i take the word , and then i will write a poem ... ... with the word inside .
and if you like it , if you like my poem ... ... if it adds something to your life in any way ... ... then you can pay me whatever you feel like .
i' il write in english , of course .
okay .
all right .
great .
so ?
pick a word .
a word .
milk shake .
milk shake ?
oh , good .
i was gonna say " rooster prick .
but great .
milk shake .
milk shake " ?
okay , milk shake .
all right , so ...
good .
i gotta say , i like this viennese variation of bum .
i like what he said about adding something to your life .
so , were we having our first fight back there ?
i think so .
i think we were .
even if we were , why does everyone think conflict is so bad ?
there' s a lot of good things coming out of conflict .
yeah , i guess so .
i always think if i could just accept the fact ... ... that my life was supposed to be difficult , that' s what' s expected ... ... then i might not get so pissed off .
and i' d just be glad when something nice happens .
that' s why i' m still in school .
it' s easier to have something to fight against .
well , we' ve all had such competitiveness ingrained in us .
you know , i can be doing the most nothing thing .
throwing some darts or shooting some pool .
then all of a sudden , i feel it come over me .
i have got to win .
is that why you tried to get me off the train ?
competitiveness ?
what do you mean ?
i got a poem .
oh , all right .
will you read it to us ?
sure .
okay .
daydream delusion
limousine eyelash
oh , baby , with your pretty face
drop a tear in my wine glass look at those big eyes
see what you mean to me
sweetcakes and milk shakes
i am a delusion angel
i' m a fantasy parade
i want you to know what i think don' t want you to guess anymore
you have no idea where i came from
we have no idea where we' re going
lodged in life
like branches in the river
flowing downstream caught in the current
i carry you
you' il carry me
that' s how it could be
don' t you know me ?
don' t you know me by now ?
great .
thanks .
thanks , man .
here you go .
thanks .
all right .
here .
thank you .
thank you .
good luck .
it was wonderful , no ?
what ?
he probably didn' t just write that .
he wrote it , but he probably plugs that word in .
you know , whatever , " milk shake .
what do you mean ?
nothing .
i loved it .
it was great .
you know what drives me crazy ?
people talking about ... ... how great technology is , how it saves all this time .
but what good is saved time if nobody uses it ?
if it just turns into more busy work .
i never hear anybody say , " with the time i' ve saved using my word processor ... ... l' m gonna go to a zen monastery and hang out .
you don' t hear that .
time is so abstract anyway .
are you looking at this girl ?
what ?
nothing .
you wanna go in here ?
you wanna go in here ?
yeah .
it' s a club , no ?
wanna go ?
hello .
fifty schillings .
each .
i got 100 .
here , i got it .
i' il buy you a beer .
thank you .
you gonna buy me a beer ?
yeah .
you think old milwaukee is expensive here ?
we haven' t talked about this yet , but are you dating anyone ?
you got a boyfriend waiting on you back in paris or anything like that ?
no , not right now .
but you did .
we broke up six months ago .
six months ago ?
oh , i' m sorry .
i mean , i' m not that sorry .
tell me about it .
no way .
i can' t .
it' s really , really boring .
come on .
tell me about it .
i was really disappointed .
i thought this one would last for a while .
he was ... ... very stupid , ugly , bad in bed , alcoholic ...
you know .
a real prize winner .
i was kind of giving him a favor .
but he left me , saying i loved him too much .
i was blocking his artistic expression or some shit like that .
but anyway , i was traumatized and became ...
and became totally obsessed with him .
so i went to a shrink , and it came up that i had written ... ... this stupid story about this woman trying to kill her boyfriend ... ... and how she' d do it .
it' s all the details of how to do it and not get caught ...
she was gonna kill her boyfriend ?
yeah , she was .
it' s nothing i would do , but it was just some writing .
no , i understand .
this stupid shrink believed everything i told her .
it was my first time seeing her .
she said she had to call the police .
she had to call the police ?
she was totally convinced i was really gonna do it .
even though i had explained it was just some writing .
she said , looking into my eyes , " the way you said it ... ... i know you are going to do it .
she was totally out of her mind .
it was my first and last session .
so what happened then ?
i totally got over him .
but now , i' m obsessed ... ... that he' s gonna die from an accident or 1000 kilometers away .
and i' m gonna be the one accused .
why is it you become obsessed with people you don' t ... ... really like that much ?
i don' t know .
so how about you ?
what ?
are you with anyone ?
it' s funny how we managed to avoid this subject for so long .
but now you have to tell me .
well , i kind of see love ... ... as this escape for two people who don' t know how to be alone .
it' s funny .
people always talk about how ... ... love is this totally unselfish , giving thing .
but if you think about it , there' s nothing more selfish .
i know .
so who just broke up with you ?
what ?
you sound like you just were hurt .
do i ?
all right .
big confession .
i should' ve told you this earlier or something .
i didn' t come to europe just to ... ... hang out and read hemingway in paris and shit like that .
i saved up my money all spring to fly to madrid ... ... and spend the summer with my girlfriend ...
your girlfriend ?
my ex girlfriend ... ... who has been on this art history program for the last year .
anyway , i got here .
we were reunited at long last ... ... and we went out to dinner our first night with six of her friends .
pedro , antonio , gonzalo ... ... maria , suzy from home .
she managed to avoid being alone with me for the first few days ... ... and i stuck around just to let it sink in that she wished i hadn' t come .
so i bought the cheapest flight out , this one leaving out of vienna .
it didn' t leave for a couple weeks , so i bought this eurail pass .
you know what' s the worst thing about somebody breaking up with you ?
it' s when you remember how little you thought about ... ... the people you broke up with , and you realize ... ... that that is how little they' re thinking about you .
you' d like to think you' re both in pain ... ... but really , they' re just , " hey , i' m glad you' re gone .
believe me , i know .
you should look at bright colors .
that' s what the shrink told me .
i was paying her 900 francs an hour ... ... to hear that i was a homicidal maniac ... ... but i could shift my obsession if i would concentrate on bright colors .
did it work ?
didn' t help your pinball .
well , no .
yeah , well , you know , i haven' t killed anyone lately .
not lately ?
that' s good .
you' re cured then .
there' s breeds of monkeys , and all they do is have sex ... ... all the time .
and they turn out to be the least violent ... ... the most peaceful , the most happy .
so maybe fooling around' s not so bad .
are you talking about monkeys ?
yes , i am .
i thought so .
why ?
i never heard this one .
but it reminds me of this perfect ... ... male argument to justify them fooling around .
women monkeys are fooling around too .
everybody' s fooling around .
that' s cute .
i have this awful , paranoid thought ... ... that feminism was mostly invented by men so they could ... ... fool around more .
woman , free your mind , free your body .
sleep with me .
we' re all happy and free , as long as i can fuck as much as i can .
all right .
but maybe there' s some biological things at work here .
if you had an island ... ... and there were 99 women on the island and only one man ... ... in a year , you' d have the possibility of 99 babies .
but if you have an island with 99 men and only one woman ... ... in a year , you have the possibility of only one baby .
so ...
you know what ?
on this island , i think there will be only , like , maybe 43 men left .
they would' ve killed each other trying to fuck this poor woman .
and on the other island , there would be 99 women , 99 babies ... ... and no more man .
because they would' ve all eaten him alive .
oh , yeah ?
there' s something to that .
on some level , women don' t mind the idea of destroying a man .
i was walking down the street with my ex girlfriend ... ... and we' d just walked by these four thuggy looking guys next to a camaro .
and one of them says , " hey , baby .
nice ass !
so i' m like , " no big deal .
i won' t get uptight about this .
plus , there were four of them .
exactly .
but she says , " fuck you , dickheads !
and i' m like , " okay .
wait a minute , here .
they' re not gonna come over and kick her ass .
so who just got pushed to the frontline on that one ?
women say they hate it if you' re all protective .
but if it suits them , then they' il tell you you' re being unmanly .
you know what ?
i don' t think woman really wants to destroy man .
even if they want to , they don' t succeed .
i' m sure even men are destroying women ... ... or are capable of destroying women much more than women ...
anyway , it' s depressing .
you know what ?
you wanna stop talking about this ?
i hate it .
men , women , it' s ...
there' s no end to it .
it' s like a skipping record .
every couple' s been having this conversation forever .
and nobody came up with anything .
i saw a documentary on that .
it' s a birth dance .
a birth dance ?
should i give her some money ?
everything that' s interesting costs a little money .
so a birth dance , huh ?
looked a little bit like a mating dance to me .
no , but really .
women used it when giving birth .
in part of the world , they still do it .
the woman in labor enters a tent ... ... and the women of her tribe surround her and dance .
they encourage her to dance with them ... ... so as to make the birth less painful .
and when the baby is born , they all dance in celebration .
i don' t think my mom would' ve gone for that .
i like the idea of dancing as something everybody participates in .
i know .
i heard about this old guy ... ... who was watching some young people dance .
he said , " how beautiful .
they' re shaking off their genitals to become angels .
i like that .
one question , though .
when the women are dancing and being all spiritual and stuff ... ... where are the men ?
are we out food gathering ?
are we not invited ?
you all don' t need us ?
men are lucky we don' t bite off their heads after mating .
certain insects do that , like spiders and stuff ?
we let you live .
what are you complaining about ?
see , you' re officially kidding .
but there' s something to that .
you keep bringing stuff like that up .
no , no .
wait a minute .
talking seriously here .
i mean , i always feel this pressure of being ... ... a strong and independent icon of womanhood ... ... and not making it look like ... ... my whole life is revolving around some guy .
but loving someone ... ... and being loved means so much to me .
i always make fun of it and stuff ... ... but isn' t everything we do in life ... ... a way to be loved a little more ?
i don' t know .
sometimes i dream ... ... about being a good father and a good husband .
and sometimes it feels really close .
but then other times ... ... it seems silly ... ... like it would ... ... ruin my whole life .
and it' s not just a fear of commitment ... ... or that i' m incapable of caring or loving because ... ... i can .
it' s just that , if i' m totally honest with myself ... ... i think i' d rather die knowing ... ... that i was really good at something .
that i had excelled in some way ... ... than that i' d just been in ... ... a nice , caring relationship .
i had worked for this older man , and once he told me ... ... that he had spent all of his life thinking about his career .
he was 52 , and it suddenly struck him ... ... that he had never really given anything of himself .
his life was for no one and nothing .
he was almost crying saying that .
i believe if there' s any kind of god ... ... it wouldn' t be in any of us ... ... not you or me ... ... but just this little space in between .
if there' s any kind of magic in this world ... ... it must be in the attempt of understanding someone sharing something .
i know , it' s almost impossible to succeed ... ... but who cares really ?
the answer must be in the attempt .
i think this is a civilization in decline .
look at the service .
where is the waitress ?
in new york , she' d be out of a job .
i' m gonna call my friend in paris ... ... who i' m supposed to have lunch with in eight hours .
pick up .
pick up the phone .
all right .
i' ve been working on my english .
you wanna talk in english , for laughs ?
yeah , okay .
that' s a good idea .
i don' t think i' il be able to make it for lunch today .
i met a guy on the train , and i got off with him in vienna .
are you crazy ?
probably .
he' s austrian ?
he' s from there ?
no , no .
he' s passing through .
he' s american .
he' s going back home tomorrow .
why' d you get off ?
well , he convinced me .
i mean , actually , i was ready to get off the train with him ... ... after talking to him a short while .
he was so sweet , i couldn' t help it .
in the lounge car , he began to talk about ... ... him as a boy seeing his great grandmother' s ghost .
i think that' s when i fell for him .
just the idea of this little boy with all those beautiful dreams .
he trapped me .
and he' s so cute .
he has beautiful blue eyes ... ... nice pink lips ... ... greasy hair .
i love it .
he' s kind of tall , and he' s a little clumsy .
i like to feel his eyes on me when i look away .
he kind of kisses like an adolescent .
it' s so cute .
what ?
yeah , we kissed .
it was so adorable .
as the night went on , i began to like him more and more .
i' m afraid he' s scared of me .
i told him the story about the woman that kills her ex boyfriend .
he must be scared to death .
he must be thinking i' m this manipulative , mean woman .
i just hope he doesn' t feel that way about me .
because , you know me , i' m the most harmless person .
the only person i could really hurt is myself .
i don' t think he' s scared of you .
i think he' s crazy about you .
really ?
i' ve known you a long time .
i got a good feeling .
you gonna see him again ?
we haven' t talked about that yet .
okay , it' s your turn .
you call your friend .
all right , all right .
i usually get this guy' s answering machine .
hi , dude .
what' s up ?
hey , frank .
how you been ?
i' m glad you' re home .
cool .
yeah .
so how was madrid ?
madrid sucked .
lisa and i had our long overdue meltdown .
too bad .
i told you , no ?
yeah , yeah .
the long distance thing just never works .
i was only in madrid for a couple days .
i got a cheaper flight out of vienna .
you know , it really wasn' t that much cheaper .
i just ...
i couldn' t go home right away .
i didn' t want to see anybody i knew .
i just wanted to be a ghost , completely anonymous .
so are you okay now ?
yeah .
i' m great .
i' m great .
that' s the thing .
i' m rapturous .
and i' il tell you why .
i met somebody on my last night in europe .
that' s incredible .
i know , i know .
you know how they say we' re all each other' s demons and angels ?
well , she was literally a botticelli angel ... ... telling me everything would be okay .
how did you meet ?
on the train .
she was sitting next to a weird couple that was fighting ... ... so she moved .
she sat right across the aisle from me .
so we started to talk .
she didn' t like me much at first .
she' s super smart ... ... very passionate ... ... and beautiful .
and i was so unsure of myself .
i thought everything i said sounded so stupid .
oh , man .
i wouldn' t worry about that .
no , i' m sure she was not judging you .
no , and by the way , she sat next to you .
i' m sure she did it on purpose .
oh , yeah ?
us men are so stupid .
we don' t understand anything about women .
they act strange , the little i know of them .
don' t they ?
i feel like this is some dream world we' re in .
yeah , it' s so weird .
it' s like our time together is just ours .
it' s our own creation .
it must be like i' m in your dream and you' re in mine .
and what' s so cool is that this whole evening ... ... all our time together , shouldn' t officially be happening .
yeah , i know .
maybe that' s why this feels so otherworldly .
but then the morning comes and we turn into pumpkins , right ?
i know .
but now , you' re supposed to produce the glass slipper ... ... and see if it fits .
it' il fit .
this friend of mine had a kid ... ... and it was a home birth , so he was there helping out .
but he said at that profound moment of birth ... ... he was watching his child experiencing life for the first time ... ... trying to take its first breath .
all he could think about was that he was looking at something ... ... that was gonna die someday .
he couldn' t get it out of his head .
and i think that' s so true .
everything is so finite .
but don' t you think that' s what ... ... makes our time and specific moments so important ?
yeah , i know .
it' s the same for us tonight , though .
after tomorrow , we' il probably never see each other again , right ?
you don' t think we' il ever see each other ?
what do you think ?
actually , i don' t know .
i hadn' t planned another ...
me too .
i live in paris , you live in the u. s. i understand .
i' d hate to make you fly .
you' d hate to fly , right ?
i' m not so scared of flying .
i mean , i could .
well , if you were gonna ... ... come to the u. s ... ... or if , you know , if i ...
i mean , i could come back here .
what ?
no , let' s just be rational adults about this .
we should try something different .
it' s not so bad if tonight is our only night , right ?
people exchange numbers , addresses .
they end up writing once , calling each other twice .
right .
fizzles out .
yeah , i don' t want that .
i hate that .
i hate that too .
why does everybody think relationships should last forever ?
yeah , why ?
it' s stupid .
but you think tonight' s it ?
i mean , that tonight' s our only night ?
it' s the only way , no ?
well , all right .
let' s do it .
no delusions , no projections .
we' il just make tonight great .
let' s do that .
we should do some kind of handshake .
give me your hand .
to our one and only ... ... night together ... ... and the hours that remain .
what ?
it' s just ...
it' s depressing , no ?
now , the only thing we' re gonna think of is ... ... when we' il have to say goodbye .
we could say goodbye now .
then we won' t worry about it .
now ?
say goodbye .
bye .
goodbye .
au revoir .
later .
later , yeah .
here' s the plan .
you' re gonna grab the glasses , and i' m gonna get the wine .
red wine .
red wine .
right .
you think you can do that ?
no problem .
wish me luck .
good luck .
hello .
do you speak english ?
a bit .
yeah ?
a bit ?
i' m having kind of an odd situation ... ... which is that ...
you see that girl over there ?
well , this is our only night together ... ... and she ...
the problem is that she wants a bottle of red wine ... ... and i don' t have any money .
but i was thinking that you might want to ... ... give me the address of this bar , and i would promise ... ... to send you the money , and you' d be making our night complete .
you would send me the money ?
your hand ?
for the greatest night in your life .
thank you very much .
so often i' ve been with people and shared beautiful moments ... ... like traveling or staying up all night and watching the sunrise .
and i knew those were special moments .
but something was always wrong .
i wished i' d been with someone else .
i knew that what i was feeling ... ... exactly what was so important to me , they didn' t understand .
but i' m happy to be with you .
you couldn' t know why a night like this ... ... is so important to my life right now ... ... but it is .
this is a great morning .
it is a great morning .
do you think we have others like this ?
what about our rational , adult decision ?
oh , yeah .
i know what you mean about wishing somebody wasn' t there .
it' s just , usually , it' s myself ... ... that i wish i could get away from .
seriously , think about this .
i have never been anywhere ... ... that i haven' t been .
i' ve never had a kiss ... ... when i wasn' t one of the kissers .
you know , i' ve never ... ... gone to the movies when i wasn' t there in the audience .
i' ve never been out bowling if i wasn' t there ... ... making some stupid joke .
that' s why so many people hate themselves .
seriously .
it' s just , they are sick to death ... ... of being around themselves .
let' s say that you and i were together all the time .
you' d start to hate a lot of my mannerisms .
the way ... ... the way every time that we would have people over ... ... l' d be insecure , and i' d get a little too drunk .
or the way i tell the same stupid , pseudo intellectual story ... ... again and again .
you see , i' ve heard all those stories ... ... so of course i' m sick of myself .
but being with you ... ... it' s made me feel like i was somebody else .
i mean , the only other way to lose yourself like that is ... ... you know , dancing ... ... or alcohol ... ... or drugs , or stuff like that .
fucking .
fucking , yeah .
that' s one way .
do you know what i want ?
what ?
to be kissed .
well , i could do that .
wait .
i have to say something stupid .
all right .
it' s very stupid .
i don' t think we should sleep together .
i want to , but since we' re never going to see each other again ... ... it' il make me feel bad .
i' il wonder who else you' re with .
i' il miss you .
i know .
it' s not very adult .
maybe it' s a female thing .
i can' t help it .
let' s see each other again .
no , i don' t want you to break our vow just so you can get laid .
i don' t want to just get laid .
i want to ...
i mean ...
i mean , i think we should .
we die in the morning , right ?
i think we should .
then it' s like some male fantasy .
meet a french girl , fuck her and never see her again .
and have this great story to tell .
i don' t want ... ... this great evening to just have been for that .
okay , we don' t have to have sex .
it' s not a big deal .
you don' t want to see me again ?
no , of course i do .
if somebody gave me the choice right now ... ... of to never see you again or to marry you ... ... i would marry you .
maybe that' s a lot of romantic bullshit ... ... but people have gotten married for a lot less .
actually ... ... i think i decided i wanted to sleep with you when we got off the train .
now that we' ve talked so much , i don' t know anymore .
why do we make everything so complicated ?
i don' t know .
what' s the first thing you' il do when you get back to paris ?
call my parents .
what about you ?
i don' t know .
i' il probably go pick up my dog .
he' s with a friend .
you have a dog ?
i love dogs .
you do ?
yeah .
oh , shit .
what ?
i don' t know .
we' re back in real time .
i know .
i hate that .
what is that ?
sounds like a harpsichord .
check that out .
somebody' s playing .
that' s cool .
can we dance to the harpsichord ?
of course .
oh , wow .
i' m gonna take your picture ... ... so i never forget you ... ... or all this .
okay , me too .
the years shall run like rabbits .
what ?
nothing .
i have ... ... this recording of dylan thomas ... ... reading a w. h. auden poem .
he' s got a great voice .
it' s like ...
all the clocks in the city
' o let not time deceive you
you cannot conquer time .
in headaches and in worry
vaguely life leaks away
and time will have his fancy
tomorrow or today . '
something like that .
that' s good .
when you talked earlier about after a few years ... ... how a couple would begin to hate each other ... ... by anticipating their reactions ... ... or getting tired of their mannerisms .
i think it would be the opposite for me .
i think i can really fall in love when i know everything about someone .
the way he' s gonna part his hair ... ... which shirt he' s gonna wear that day ... ... knowing the exact story he' d tell in a given situation .
i' m sure that' s when i know i' m really in love .
hey , guess what .
what ?
we didn' t go to those guys ' play .
play ?
the cow ?
oh , yeah , we didn' t .
oh , no .
we missed it .
you know what bus to take to the airport ?
no problem .
i should get on this one .
right here .
you wanna get on there ?
i guess this is it , no ?
i really ...
you know ...
yeah , i know .
me too .
have a great life .
have fun with everything you' re gonna do .
good luck with school and all that .
i hate this .
me too .
the train is about to leave .
you know all this bullshit we' re talking about ... ... not seeing each other ?
i don' t want that .
i don' t either .
you don' t ?
i waited for you to say it .
why didn' t you say something ?
i was afraid you didn' t wanna see me .
what do you wanna do ?
maybe we should meet here in five years or something .
five years ?
that' s a long time .
it' s awful .
it' s like a sociological experiment .
how about one year ?
one year .
how about six months ?
six months ?
it' s gonna be freezing .
who cares ?
we come here , we go somewhere else .
six months from now or last night ?
last night .
six months from last night , which was ... ... june 16th .
so track nine , six months from now at 6 : 00 at night .
december .
it' s a train ride for you , but i gotta fly all the way here .
but i' m gonna be here .
okay , me too .
all right .
we won' t call , write or ...
no , it' s depressing .
your train' s gonna leave .
say goodbye .
bye .
goodbye .
au revoir .
later .
