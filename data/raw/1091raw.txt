it happened again ...
last night .
ohh .
mmm .
it' s hard to explain .
it starts out like an earthquake ...
and i look over at the girl next to me ... and whoever she is , she' s not nicole .
and all i feel is emptiness .
and that' s when it happens .
this great big black hole ... opens up over my head .
again with the black hole .
yeah .
it' s nothing but vast emptiness .
and then what ?
i panic .
unh !
you gotta help me .
you gotta ...
light a candle for me or something .
i' m not lighting a candle ... so you can feel better about getting laid .
that' s not what this is about .
look , it' s been six months since nicole dumped you .
and you' re running around feeling sorry for yourself ... screwing every woman in sight .
you want me to tell you it' s ok , that god forgives you ... but at some point , it' s not ok , and he doesn' t forgive you !
what kind of advice is that ?
if you don' t like my advice , go see a real priest .
how will you be a real priest if you can' t follow the rules ?
besides , you' re ... you' re the only priest i know who happens to be my brother .
and you' re only a year away from being a real priest anyway .
two years .
look , what you need to do ... is deal with your emotions and stop screwing around .
what i don' t need is a lecture from you , dick .
you' re the dick
no .
that sounds great .
that sounds incredible .
uh huh .
we' il probably have to bump a few things ... from our schedule , but we can make it happen for tonight .
yeah .
matt and i will definitely be there tonight .
we' re putting our bells on right now .
ok .
all right .
bye bye .
i can' t go .
what are you talking about ?
i just don' t feel like it right now .
you don' t fe look !
i know you' re still trying to work out your nicole issues ... with the big black hole , but trust me , trust me
i don' t have any nicole issues .
hi .
i' m one of the many pictures of nicole ... that infest ryan and matt' s apartment after six months .
and she' s hot , matt .
i don' t mind looking at her .
i' m just saying you have issues .
these are not issues .

i' il talk to the bagel guy when he gets here .
what does the bagel guy have to do with this ?
the bagel guy knows everything .
the dude' s incredible .
then how come can' t he get here on time with the bagels ?
appreciate it .
is that what i think it is ?
don' t worry .
can i see it ?
hey .
dude , it' s just been one of those days , you know ?
yes , i do .
i got held up at this import export place in chinatown .
some party .
golden spear ?
that' s the one .
their mimosas they make there are strong .
go straight to your head .
blbbh .
i used to know someone who worked there .
you know tatiana ?
yeah , i know tatiana .
she' s nice .
no , she' s not nice .
she' s hot .
i' d hit that .
and how about merj ?
yeah , i know merj .
and what about that really hot chick that got engaged ?
that was funny .
what really hot chick got engaged ?
the expediter chick .
you know , real slinky .
what' s her name ?
nicole ?
nicole .
that' s it .
man , she knows the guy , like , two weeks .
she goes to france , she comes back , she' s engaged .
now , she is spontaneous combustion hot .
i would definitely hit that .
how do you know it' s nicole n nicole that got engaged ?
dude , that' s what the banner said at the party .
congratulations nicole .
whew .
i can' t believe it ... because that girl , you can' t even look right at her .
she' s so hot you need one of those eclipse watching things ... just to look directly at her , she' s so radiantly hot !
it makes me want to just throw her down , you know ... and just you know what i mean ?
yeah .
i' m glad we can connect on that .
later , pimp .
later .
rrr !
hey , matt
matt ?
you you all right ?
unh !
oh !
oh !
oh , god .
i am so sorry . it s ok . it s ok .
are you ok ?
yeah , i' m fine .
is there anything i can do to make it better ?
um ... anything ?
again ?
another girl already ?
it s not even the weekend .
i know , i know .
she met someone .
nicole' s getting married .
i' m sorry .
i mean , what can i do ?
tell me what i can do .
i don' t know what to tell you .
this isn' t really a problem i know much about .
listen , isn' t part of the priestly thing ... giving relationship advice ?
relationship advice , yes .
sex advice , no .
part of the priestly thing , and stop calling it that ... is not to have sex , remember ?
it s funny .
i didn' t say a thing about sex .
sure you did .
no , i didn' t .
i guess thinking about sex is part of the priestly thing .
at least for some .
get out .
fine .
good morning , matt .
morning , father .
what' s with the purple banners ?
lent .
starts today .
going to be a long forty days this year .
i' m giving up my one vice those precious little madeleine cookies ... dipped in a starbucks mocha .
it' s so hard giving up what you love the most .
i' ve got it !
jesus christ , john , i' ve got an answer !
and the question is ?
nicole .
again ?
no sex for lent for forty days .
if i can do that , then everything will be ok .
that isn' t what lent is .
lent is about sacrifice and growth through self denial .
lent is to remember
how christ felt during the fast in the desert .
i grew up in the same house as you , moron .
but when it comes down to it , that' s exactly what this is .
this is growth , this is self denial ... and this is sacrifice .
dude !
it' s not that simple , matt .
trust me .
it is that ...
you' re right .
you' re totally right .
sex alone is not enough .
it has to be sex and all things sex like .
you' il never be able to do that .
just listen , here' s the plan .
one no sex .
two no sexual intimacy of any kind .
no nibbling , no biting , no scratching .
no sucking , no fondling .
none of that .
and three ... no masturbation .
you won' t last a week .
oh , you' re wrong , brother .
i' m gonna go the distance .
mmm / / then i was grown to be a man / / grown to be a man / / and the devil would call my name / / grown to be a man / / i said , " who do " / / " who do you think you' re foolin ' ? " / / grown to be a man / / i can snatch a little purity / / my mama loved me / / she loved me / / she got down on her knees and hugged me / / and she loved me like a rock / / whoa , yeah / / rocked me like the rock of ages and loved me / / she loved me , loved me , loved me / / loved me like a rock / / my mama loves me / / loves me like a rock /
your brother looks happy .
he' s just taken a vow of celibacy .
oh .
oh , dear .
/ live , baby , live / / now that the day is over / / i got a new sensation / / in perfect moments / / so impossible to refuse /
/ sleep , baby , sleep / / now that the night is over / / and the sun comes like a god / / into our room /
whoo .
dude . / all perfect light and prom /
dude .
what the fuck is that ?
this is a 1966 karmann ghia coupe .
when i' m finished with that , i' m gonna do ... the caterham super seven cycle fender special .
we' re going out tonight .
there' s this club
remember that australian chick jennifer moss ?
she' s got friends visiting from sydney .
can' t .
i have laundry .
do you know why they call it down under , matt ?
i still can' t .
do you realize how much time we waste thinking about girls ?
you want some alone time in the apartment for jerking off .
that' s cool .
i can do that .
that' s cool .
i' il tell ' em you said hi .
ohh .
do you have change for two dollars ?
excuse me .
i forgot something to read .
do you mind if i borrow this ?
thanks .
a lovers ' rendezvous .
you you underline words that you don' t know ... and then look them up later ?
right ?
and you underlined " tryst " ... which is a meeting of lovers .
i do that , too , so ...
matt ?
it was on the cover of the magazine .
can i borrow a sheet of fabric softener ?
thanks .
it' s been really fun almost chatting with you .
same time next week ?
ok .
bye .
you are way ahead of schedule .
if i were you , i' d give me something else to do quick .
what about the willow and smart account ?
think you can handle that ?
i know window treatments aren' t the sexiest
oh , no , no .
doesn' t bother me at all .
good .
you' il be designing the entire webpage .
ok .
hey , ryan .
what' s happening ? / turn off the lights /
do you know how many hours i spent ...
looking for my temple of poon tape ?
one .
that' s a long time to be looking for porn , matt .
what the fuck is going on here ?
one you can' t do it .
you can' t .
this isn' t a personal attack towards you .
no man can do it .
it goes against nature .
the male was biologically designed to spread his seed .
you' re gonna piss off the seeds , man !
you' re gonna it goes against science !
you want to be the guy who goes against science ?
and two ?
two are you out of your fucking mind ?
you' re the guy who can' t finish a sandwich !
you think you can go forty days ?
four you this isn' t normal !
she got engaged , ryan .
nicole got engaged .
well ...
i knew that .
i knew that .
i i didn' t tell you ... just because i thought you' d get pissed off .
i' m sorry .
i should have told you .
i had to hear it from the bagel guy !
does that guy know everything ?
you should have told me !
i know that .
i completely should have told you .
i' m sorry .
just explain this to me , though , all right ?
nicole gets engaged , you decide to take a vow of abstinence .
haven' t you gotten to the point where you need to take a break ?
yes !
look , matt , i swear off girls once a week .
then , before you know it , it' s morning .
that' s part of the game .
did your brother put you up to this or something ?
you know what ?
he' s about as supportive as you are .
what do you care anyway ?
this doesn' t affect you in any way .
you ...
this affects everyone .
right now , the pot is at two hundred .
it' s a minimum bet of $50 a day , which goes into the pot .
if your day' s the day , you win the pot , less expenses ... and a bottle of champagne .
if more than one person bets on the winning day ... they split the pot according to the percentage ... of the day' s total bets that have been placed .
i go forty days without sex all the time .
but , dude , you spank it .
no jerkin ' off ?
true .
yeah .
that' s why my money' s on today .
there are two things to bet on one will it be with some girl ?
two will it be some lonely night down the stretch ?
pbbt .
how will we know that , exactly ?
well , i can' t tell you everything ... but i can tell you that there is somebody on the inside .
yep .
like ryan .
ok , so matt doesn' t know anything ?
no , no , no , no .
that is very important key .
this is great .
i mean , this is crazy great .
everything is so much simpler when there' s no sex involved .
i think this is the best thing that' s ever happened to me .
you' re starting to feel it , aren' t you ?
what ?
the abstinence it' s starting to get under your skin .
no .
not at all .
i' m fine .
you know what i gave up for lent ?
meat .
why don' t you try something like that ?
trust me .
celibacy takes years ... of commitment , character , and discipline ... which , quite frankly , are not your best traits .
you think you' re the only one with a little willpower ?
a little willpower ?
if you can do this , i can do this .
you have no idea .
what is so hard about forty days ?
they' re guys .
to them , forty minutes is like an eternity .
they' re like animals .
their entire lives revolve around their penises .
how many days do you think he' il last ?
days ?
mm mmm , girl .
watch this .
uh oh .
you are so bad .
hi .
hi .
did you , um , do these layouts ?
i helped on them , kind of .
these are amazing .
thanks .
you' re like this totally amazing layout guy .
something' s happening .
behind me .
ok , come here .
oh , no .
hey , i have a big layout problem .
you do ?
can you keep a secret ?
yeah .
oh , goodness .
i have this tattoo of a butterfly ... on the inside of my thigh .
yes , you do .
and i want to get something on the other side ... but , um , i don' t know what to get .
any ideas ?
i don' t know .
i was thinking about ...
like a cute little pussycat or something .
do you like pussy ... cats , matt ?
yeah .
' cause if you' re not doing anything later ... you should come over and help me pick one out .
i can' t .
i mean , we can' t ... because pussycats are mean to butterflies .
they don' t like them .
they dislike them very much ... and hit them with their paws ... and it hurts the little butterfly .
right .
yeah .
well , ok , if you change your mind ...
did she just xerox her ass ?
what ?
get off me !
give me a call , ok ?
this is a photocopy of candy' s ass ?
yep .
you' re gonna call her , right ?
obviously , you' re gonna call her .
no .
i' m not gonna call her .
ha ha !
as soon as you don' t want it , they can smell it .
she photocopied her ass .
she photocopied her own ass .
you' re doing a lot of laundry lately .
didn' t you just do it last week ?
just keeping it clean .
who is she ?
look , i' m not gonna sit in my room ... and build models for the next forty days .
oh , you like her !
it' s it' s not that .
no , no , no !
have a nice time . / basically probability / / says that things gonna start with me / / it' s been so long / / on my shelf / / train comes , i don' t know its destination / / it' s a one way ticket to a bad , bad situation /
busted . / train comes , i don' t know /
yeah .
i thought i should tell you i can speak just fine .
they were all out of flowers .
yeah .
that' s cute .
i' m matt .
officially .
officially matt .
officially erica .
officially .
so , you normally do your laundry on friday nights ?
yeah .
it' s my new thing .
new thing ?
well , there was a party ...
don' t you ever feel like you just keep meeting ... the same exact people over and over ?
like people that went to this kind of college ...
and now work that kind of job , right ?
yeah .
i want to have a party with a list at the door ... of all my friends and friends of friends ... and if you' re on that list ... or you know somebody on that list ... then you cannot come in .
how do you know i' m not on that list ?
nobody on that list would have talked to me ...
like you did last week .
or not talked to me .
fair enough , fair enough .
so , what do you do for laundry money ?
i' m a cyber nanny .
what what' s that ?
i spend all day looking for pornography on the web .
all right , say you have a ten year old kid ... with an imac and a browser , and she searches " girlfriends " ... and then gets lesbian mud wrestling .
probably not the best thing .
but you can' t avoid it .
like today , i ran a search for " sandbox " ... and got " eat my box " ...
sandy' s hot box " ... and my favorite , " vagina beach .
my job is to find the site and block it out .
so , you have to look at these sex sites all day long ?
yeah .
all day .
drive you crazy after a while ?
yeah .
some days i think ... that if i have to look at another blowjob i' il scream .
god , yes .
same thing happens to me .
what , you' re going on a date with her ?
what , you' re going on a date with her ?
isn' t that kind of getting in the way of your thing ?
no , not at all .
so you' re not into her ?
oh , i' m totally into her .
so how can you not want to fuck her ?
listen , you haven' t heard a word i said .
it' s perfect the way it is , and she' s amazing ... and we are totally connecting ... and it' s not a sexual thing , not for either of us .
dude , you' ve got to tell her .
seriously .
you can pass off two dates without a kiss as old fashioned .
you go three , and you' re a homo .
yeah , yeah , i can see that .
just got off the phone with the guy .
there' s a preliminary report a date happening on thursday .
what ?
different girl ?
same girl .
different date .
he is taking her on ... the bus .
on the bus where ?
nowhere .
that' s the point .
he just gets on the bus and goes around .
mmm .
if you want to get laid ... you take a chick to a fancy restaurant .
but if you really like her ... you take her to your secret place .
that' s the bus for matt .
yeah .
mine' s the post office .
i don' t understand .
so he' s gonna get laid ?
why ask me questions ?
i' il take thursday .
i like to take girls there , and i say , " let' s go postal .
shut up !
shut up !
are you gonna be ok with this guy ?
yeah .
he' s great .
i' il be waiting up for you .
no , you won' t .

so , did any other guys ever take you on a bus ?
well , there ... there was a guy who got us kicked off a bus ... and another guy who tried to steal a bus ... and then the most recent guy i dated ... went through a phase where he actually thought he was a bus .
where do you find guys like that ?
i don' t .
i don' t .
they just ...
they always find me .
they always find me .
what about you ?
any criminal records , addictions ... or weird little secrets i should know about right now ?

i didn' t think so .
you' re pretty up front about yourself .
i have no reason not to be honest , i guess .
yeah .
it always catches up to you if you' re not .
yeah .
that' s the way it is with me .
i mean , was with me .
back in my more youthful , wasted , younger days .

apparently , speed is a very expensive drug , sam .
dude , you are so gone .
no , i love hanging out with him .
he' s amazing .
i' m treated like an equal , and we' re connecting
it sucks , doesn' t it ?

nothing .
whoo .
that was weird .
no more drugs pour moi .
what the fuck is going on ?
you guys put up a web page about me ?
web page ?
please .
be more insulting , man .
this is a complicated betting pool .
you guys can' t make this public .
this is not something that i want everyone to know about .
it' s a little too late , dude .
today' s bets .
originally , the spread favored day 26 ... but with all the dating action in mattland these days ...
i' m gonna recommend day 23 .
someone just placed another bet .
i had one come in all the way from bangladesh .
little haji just loves to roll the dice .
you guys have advertisers ?
a friend of mine started up a business ... and i gave him a good price .

you don' t have to .
i just read about it over the fucking internet .
erica !
erica , i should have told you about this .
i thought you' d think i was a freak .
i' m sorry .
i can' t believe the load of bullshit that you fed to me ... about telling the damn truth .
i i did this for myself .
i didn' t think anybody else knew about it .
i swear to god .
plus , if i told you , you' d think i was a sex addict .
are you ?
no !
then what is the point ?
what is the point of this whole thing ?
i just wanted to see what it would be like ... without all the shit that sex brings to the picture .
oh , so i' m like some science experiment ?
no !
i look , i was going through a really rough time ... and i just wanted to stop .
i wanted to stop thinking about sex .
not that i was thinking about sex all the time ...
i just wanted to stop .
and the thing is , it' s working .
it' s really working .
i' m glad it' s working for one of us .
you stupid , stupid , silly little person !
why did you have to go and tell everyone ?
look , if you' re so ashamed , maybe you shouldn' t be doing it .
i' m not ashamed !
i' m embarrassed !
then quit , matt .
just quit .
nobody thinks you' il finish this thing .
i' m not fucking quitting .
everything was going great until you had to ...
i stopped having sex ...
i' m totally falling for erica ... and i' m finally over nicole .
you really think you' re over her ?
fuck , yeah !
bitch .
hmm .
i ran into her and her fianc last night .
what was he like ?
he he parties with a friend of mine .
apparently , the dude works late every night .
that' s what i heard .
so ?
he works late every night a different girl every night .
not that it should matter to you .
no .
why would it matter to me ?
yeah .
my wife and i have been married for eight years .
i love her very much .
i ... consider myself a lucky person .
that being said ... this woman ... does not put out at all .
i mean , at all .
i mean , we used to have sex everywhere .
we used to have sex in this office .
we had sex on this floor .
we had sex on this desk .
on that chair .
ok .
i get it , i get it .
but now , i have to practically beg for it .
i mean , it was kind of hot for the first eight months .
the chasing after her ... surprising her with my sexy new underwear .
but now , i feel a little like a ...
like i' m a pervert .
i heard about the vow ... and i think it' s genius .
thanks .
i mean , this is the perfect way for me ... to regain the power in my relationship .
see , i take the vow .
i tell her i' m gonna do without for a few months .
i bet in half the time she' s going to be begging for it .
don' t you think ?
what do you think ?
i think you don' t know what you' re getting yourself into .
hey , put that away .
books get you in trouble around here .
i can' t work right now .
so go home .
i need the money .
so work .
it all reminds me of matt .
even " donkey lovers " ?
call him or leave .
you' re bugging me .
/ a strange condition / / a daily prison / / you' ve got me out of my head / / and i don' t know what i came for / / send me money , baby / / do not leave out a wage / / you know you' re the best thing / / in the corner of this place / / and i want you to know /
how' s the chicken ?
good .
/ this strange condition /
why is this so weird ?
if i told you , " don' t think about the color red ... " what would you think about ?
sex .
ok , so we' re both sitting here thinking about sex ... because we can' t think about sex ... because we can' t talk about sex ... and we certainly cannot have sex .
it' s like , so what are we doing here ?
you know , if i didn' t have this vow thing ...
i' d kiss you right now .
thanks .
thanks .
you ok ?
i' m fine .
are you sure ?
i' il be right back .

david' s the youngest executive vice president ... at morgan stanley .
yeah , well , i' m the youngest
yeah , hey , it' s all good , matt .
listen , honey , you want to give it one more try ?
it' s good to see you .
yeah , you , too .
bye .
she' s the real reason you took that vow .
no .
she' s just an ex .
the vow is something completely separate from her .
you' re a really bad liar .
i get that a lot .
look , i know i should' ve told you about her .
yeah , you should' ve .
but i guess it' s hard for you to get the truth out .
shit .
hey , how about i quit the vow ?
i mean , honestly , i don' t care about the vow .
oh , sure , now st. matt wants a piece .
no , that' s not it at all .
you don' t want me ?
no , of course i want you .
it' s just
i care about the vow , and
you do ?
yeah , i do .
and her ?
i don' t know .
i' il tell you what .
you want me ?
yeah .
then finish your stupid vow .
and if you finish it ... then maybe we can talk about being together .
maybe .
i' ve given up sex , because i just ...
i just want to connect with people on a deeper level .
really ?
yeah .
is it working ?
working ?
of course it' s working !
it' s like this incredible high .
can you not feel that ?
just sitting here talking with you ...
i' m mind orgasmic right now .
mind orgasmic .
yeah .
hmm .
oh , god ohh
we need to talk .
i can' t .
i gotta go .
i i understand what you' re doing , matt .
you do ?
mm hmm .
women have been doing this since , well , forever ... so we know all about the power .
see , us having the power , that' s part of the system ... and by you taking the power , you' re fucking with the system .
and i think you see why we can' t let that happen .
you bet on today .
this is about money .
ah ah .
signed and notarized commitment ... to donate all proceeds to charity .
so you want to have sex with me to regain " the power " ?
we' re willing to do whatever is necessary ... to get the job done .
why do you keep saying " we " ?
oh , fuck .
now , we think that this offer is more than fair .
can i talk to you for a second ?
excuse me .
what ?
i don' t think i can do this .
andie , we talked about this already , ok ?
i know , but just look at him .
i mean , he used to be kind of cute ... but now he' s just twitchy .
shh .
it' il be over in , like , two seconds , ok ?
would you care to join us , hmm ?
mmm .
oh , god .
not the tongues .
oh , my god .
i gotta go .
yesterday was fine .
i mean , physically speaking , i was fine .
but today ... i' m not fine .
this morning at the coffee shop ... they were sponsoring hot women wearing no bras day .
whoo .
hot , hot women wearing no bras ?
i mean , like hot , hot women .
there were 48 breasts at the cafe trieste this morning .
/ take a look at me /
i know this phase .
it passes .
but why does this have to happen now ?
i mean , yesterday erica tells me i have to finish the vow ... and today i' m slammed by sex .
why ?
look , you' ve gone 26 days ?
mm hmm .
that' s very admirable .
yeah , thanks .
but you can' t come to mom and dad' s tonight .
if i don' t go , they' il kill me .
you don' t want them to see you like this .
i don' t want me to see me like this ... but if there' s one place i' m safe it' s at home , right ?
mmm .
right ?
from thy bounty , through christ , our lord .
amen .
so , dad , when your hip heals , will it be like normal ?
yeah , pretty much .
i can golf , ride a bike .
he just has to be careful .
it' s amazing the things you can do now .
you know , i' m part of a pilot program ... that' s tracking my range of motion .
really ?
oh , they don' t want to hear about that .
no , no .
they want to see what effect ... the operation' s had on my sex life .
sorry .
do we have to talk about this at dinner ?
bev , we' re all adults here , aren' t we ?
isn' t sex a god given natural part of life ?
don' t start , dad .
why not talk about it ?
i think a good sexual appetite ... is a real , normal , healthy part of being a man .
and a woman .
who wants more beans ?
i do .
they' re grown men .
they' re old enough to know ... that their mother' s machine is still running hot .
walter , this isn' t the moment .
oh , no .
let me show you people .
see ... they sent me this sheet .
a whole bunch of different positions on it .
i just check off the ones i can do
like this one here .
i can do that , so i check the box .
hey , here' s an old standby .
but , see , i can' t do that because of my hip ... so , you know , i don' t check the box .
bev , have we ever tried this before ?
walter , how could you forget the maui hilton ?
in the shower .
i nearly killed myself .
yes .
damn it .
surprise inspection .
what the hell is that thing ?
it' s a special light that allows me to see ... if any fluids have been liberated .
keep up the good work .
hmm .
mmm .
ohh .

jeez , that' s an oversight .
i' il fix that .
i know what you mean .

i mean , not only is my wife not begging for it ... she' s not ...
i' ve never seen her so happy .
and today .

ohh .
who' s that ?
what' s that ?
oh , god , that' s that new girl in tech support .
did you know that regular ejaculation ... is a preventative against prostate cancer ?
so , is it that you hate your penis ?
because , i mean , i personally feel like that' s
god , that' s one of the best relationships i have .
why do you think they call it the little head ?
i' il tell you why .
because he has ideas .

what are those , like some kind of a bribe ?
more like ... gentle persuasion .
is this going to get worse before it gets better ?
probably , but i got to get this out ... before i lose my train of thought .
see ...
nicole had this ... special status .
more like a special power .
and i couldn' t match it ... and i couldn' t find anybody to replace it .
i think i get it .

it' s very easy to confuse a physical attraction ... with a real connection .
yeah .
sometimes you just can' t tell .
well , you can tell .
you can tell by the kiss .
you know , the other stuff the sex , " is he hot ?
it doesn' t matter .
all that matters is the kiss .
how do you know about me ?
i don' t .
i don' t even know if you can feel that .
i can feel that .
is this against the rules ?
i' il let you be the judge of that .
i' m thinking now .
i' m thinking now , too .
come here .
/ i wanna walk beside you / / nowhere that i have ever been / / and all the dreams inside you / / i am the one you have not seen / / i feel immune / / by my own mind / / i can' t refuse / / an offer to make love / / to you /
/ how come your words affect me /
ooh . / i have not wanted / / to be allowed / / and yet i made you set free / / with all the meaning was the sound / / in your refrain / / i hear the chords / / of love in vain /
ohh . / how can i help / / calling your name ? /
i wasn' t supposed to do that , was i ?

i don' t want to hear about it .
ok .
but now you' re on his side ?
yeah , erica .
he melted my heart .

i was trying to take a part of me and make it go away .
and i closed my world off , and i put myself in a little box .
