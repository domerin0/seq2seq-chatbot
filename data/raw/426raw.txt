you have to consider that they had a break during the war .
and last year saint louis gave them a real good run for their money .
so this year the yankees are gonna get whupped .
you' re crazy , osier .
brookiyn ain' t ever gonna beat the yankees .
never beat them yet , never gonna .
you watch and see .
this is the dodgers ' year now that they have jackie robinson .
them bums couidn' t beat a dead horse with or without that negro .
and you know what ?
i' m wiiiing to bet some hard earned cash on it .
i might just take you up on that .
how much are you proposing ?
quiet down , rex .
i said quiet .
hey , wally , it' s osler .
what' s going on ?
i got this weird pulse coming in on my frequencies .
it' s aii over mine right now .
you , too ?
it' s weird .
what do you think it is ?
i think it' s the pinkos doing something with our radios .
it' s not a communist conspiracy .
what the heck' s the matter with you , boy ?
i thought it was coming from white sands but now i think it' s coming from rosweii .
maybe i' il drive up there and take a look .
caii me if you find something .
yeah .
talk to you later .
that is it .
i don' t see anything out there , rex .
hello !
come back .
come here , boy !
what the heck is that ?
oh , my god !
antarctlca 2003
axxon resources study corps
what the hell is it ?
could be a rock or some sort of fossil .
we picked it up in the landsat satellite .
first we thought it was a cap deposit , but the resolution is definitely solid .
how deep in the ice is it ?
four , maybe five meters .
what do we do about it ?
i talked to the nasa research station at rundell peak .
they' il take it until it melts , and then decide what to do with it .
all right .
dig it up .

language is a signaiing system that uses sounds to convey thoughts and emotions .
what makes humans unique is our abiiity to introduce into ianguage ... thoughts about the past , present , or future ... at any point in time and space .
he' il call you back .
not all language is based on sound .
we communicate in other ways ... that are much less overt than the spoken word .
so do animals .
the only difference between them and us can be summarized in one word : novelty .
when an animal gives a warning that danger is imminent ... it uses a series of fairly predictable calls or signals ... that animals of its kind have used before .
this is decidedly not the case with humans .
oxford engiish dictionary lists 615, 000 words ... in the english language .
that' s 3, 000 more than five years ago ... and thousands less than a few years from now .
on the other hand ... there' s little or no novelty in animal language .
tragically , english cows make the same sounds as french cows .
julian .
sam .
listen .
bachman called .
he wants to see you right away .
why ?
i don' t know .
did he sound like there was a problem ?
come in .
good afternoon , john .
come in , sit down .
a certain matter has come to my attention .
john , about the student , right ?
i' ve been meaning to talk to you about her .
i don' t think i want to know about that .
no , look , do you know who alexie gierach is ?
stanford genetics .
yes , i met him once at a faculty thing when i was there .
two years ago , he went to the antarctic to head up a new research project for nasa .
yesterday , i received this from him .
a sateiiite imaged an unidentified mass ... in the ice sheif down there .
it appears to measure approximateiy 6 meters iong by 3 meters wide .
at first , they thought it might be a rock siag ... or a fossiiized whaie .
but now they' re not so sure .
why ?
well , station telemetry identified some sort of radio signal ...
being emitted from it .
really ?
they burned a spectrogram of it on this cd .
i thought you might like to look at it .
plain or with cheese ?
i don' t care .
look at this .
what have you got ?
look at that .
nonrandom ?
definitely .
fixed length pulse groups , discriminate text ... consisting of prime numbers repeated over and over .
what about a meteorite ?
a meteorite as big as this would' ve left a mile wide crater in the ice shelf .
it would explain an electromagnetic pulse .
not a nonrandom signal .
check this out .
that' s a kickass frequency .
the dish transmitter at arecibo is 1, 000 feet in diameter .
the most powerful on earth .
this signal' s stronger and it' s coming from something the size of a pickup truck .
you said it was nonrandom ?
yes , with a fixed pulse device .
you mean some sort of new search signal ?
it' s possible .
but search text is always diverse samples with mathematical data .
this has no parallel plain text .
like a tracking signal .
we' re talking about a target signal of 30, 000 light years .
we don' t have that technology .
not that you know of .
i know what' s on this disk .
i gotta see this up close .
too many people know about your past with setl .
they' d read something into it .
you say that it may be a russian satellite , and i wanna run cryptanalysis on it .
all right .
but you do anything to embarrass this institution ... you' re gonna spend the rest of your days ... teaching communication skills to the penguins down there .
thank you , john .
research lab , falkland island
what is that bloody thing ?
i don' t know .
i' il record it and we' il pass it on to the yanks at kitt peak .
maybe they' il know .
there' s a transport ieaving edwards air force base tonight .
stops in panama and south georgia islands .
then they' il decide whether to go rundell peak ...
why not ?
antarctic weather at this time is bad ...
and sometimes you can' t get in or out .
great .
kltt peak observatory tucson , arlzona
where' d you get this ?
from a radio tech at the falklands .
one of their satellites intercepted it two days ago .
where is it originating from ?
antarctic .
it was somewhere in the ross ice shelf , then it moved farther inland .
moved ?
that' s what they said .
what can be boosting it ?
haven' t a fucking clue .
let' s pass it on to nasa .
okay .
here .
you' re going to need this .
1, 200 feet approaching .
the wheels are down and locked .
we' re going in .
gear' s down and locked in place .
let' s lock it up .
we' re coming in too hard .
i can' t see a damn thing .
the lights , i see them .
we' re right on top of it .
welcome to the south pole .
rundell peak , antarctlca
mr. rome .
i' m nyla wurtsen .
getting here this time of year is difficult .
surprised they let you fly in .
mcmurdo weather grounded everything an hour ago .
they did ?
yes , indefinitely .
here .
no , i got it .
sure ?
hold on , let me take this .
what' s your name again ?
nyla .
how far underground are we , nyla ?
about 20 meters .
we' re on the third level .
there are two more below us : the genetic labs and the fields .
what the hell is that ?
it' s a glacier shift .
happens all the time , mr. rome .
it' s safe , right ?
yes , it' s fine .
i' m going to take you to the living quarters .
dr. gierach is waiting for us there .
he thought you might want some rest after the flight .
actually , i was hoping to see the object .
whatever you want .
so , nyla , right ?
right .
what do you do here ?
i came with michael ...
dr. straub .
i was his graduate assistant at mlt and he offered me a position here .
what position is that ?
dr. brecher warned us about you .
you' re not talking about kate brecher , are you ?
dr. brecher .
welcome to rundell peak .
good to see you again , dr. gierach .
yes .
when john said you were coming , i was delighted .
i' ve followed your career off and on .
that' s exactly what it' s been .
your time with seti must have been memorable .
yes , my lost in space days .
and so , there it is .
in compliance with comnap provisions ... we' ve kept the room at a temperature ... that won' t abnormally accelerate the melting process .
and as you see , it seems to be melting at an unusual rate .
what do you think is inside it ?
my first guess would have been ... a shale slag caught in a glacier .
the radio signal rules that out .
could it be the work of setl ?
there is no more setl .
the government has no interest in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence .
they pulled the funding .
if this is really what it appears to be ... this technology is way beyond what any of us were working on .
for the sake of argument , let' s say it was placed here ... by something else .
you said it , not me .
alexie , they need you in the corn lab .
we' il talk later .
what did nasa say when you told them about this ?
i haven' t .
why not ?
our work here is in a very sensitive stage ... and we both know how paranoid nasa can get .
hello , julian .
you okay ?
yeah .
i feel better now .
save the endearing charm for nyla .
i' m not sure she' s my type .
too old ?
maybe a little .
you don' t have a type .
i got lots of types .
what happened to what' s his name , speaking of types ?
it ended .
don' t screw this up for me , julian .
what we' re doing here is important .
what makes you think i' m going to screw it up ?
experience .
i' il show you to your room .
it' s not the plaza , but it' s the best we have .
all i need is a bed .
counting nyla , there' s four women working here .
try not to set any records .
hello ?
i' m just checking to see if you want breakfast .
what time is it ?
a little after 10 : 00 .
are you going to do some calisthenics ?
it just makes it easier ... because of the antibacterial showers when i' m working in the fields .
when i first came here ...
i worked in the seeding labs by myself .
sometimes the pollens are so thick they' re hard to wash out of your clothes .
so i worked naked .
sounds perfectly logical to me .
dr. brecher made me stop .
shame on her .
this is the future .
genetically engineered , hydroponically grown food .
how big is it ?
3 . 2 acres .
the wheat lab is slightly larger .
i' ve got to get to work .
you' re finally up and about ?
this is some place .
yeah .
who' s your friend ?
dr. michael straub .
he' s a brilliant geneticist .
i think he' s got a sock in his speedo .
very funny .
i' m not trying to be funny .
i' m just making an observation .
i watched the two of you laughing ...
and happened to notice .
actually , we were talking about you .
i' il take that as a compliment .
so , what' s up with you and what' s his name ?
stubb ?
that guy , strobe ?
strubb ?
straub .
it' s none of your business .
what are we gonna talk about ?
i don' t want to talk about anything .
i want you to do whatever it is you have to do and get out as soon as you can .
do you have any idea what we' re doing ?
you' re wearing bathing suits and growing corn .
everything' s always a joke with you , isn' t it ?
we' ve made a breakthrough in genetics that' il put us in the running for a nobel .
for the first time in my life i' m part of something truly significant .
i' m sorry .
you' re always sorry .
then it always turns into jokes and innuendos .
that' s not gonna happen .
how did you squeeze this kind of money out of nasa ?
they' re obsessed with selling congress on planetary colonization .
agrigenetics is one of the first steps .
a lot of this came from your seti labs after nasa pulled the plug on the funding .
it' s impressive .
almost as impressive as your cornfield .
what do you really think is in that block of ice ?
i' m sorry for what i said .
i know how much your work meant to you .
you look good .
what do we know about this juiian rome ?
37 years old .
both parents deceased .
killed in an automobile accident .
he graduated from stanford university with a degree in appiied linguistics .
top of his class .
on a fast track for a doctorate when he got in trouble ... with a female student in one of his classes .
he never finished his doctorate .
he ended up working for seti as a decoding cryptologist .
he' s an alien hunter .
was an alien hunter .
when nasa pulled the plug , he left seti and returned to teaching .
this time at berkeley .
he' s been there for two years .
what' s the connection between gierach and rome ?
gierach actuaiiy contacted dr. bachman that i toid you about .
bachman turned it over to rome .
there' s something else .
what' s that ?
the student he had the affair with , her name is katherine brecher .
she' s one of the researchers down at rundell peak .
" osler " ?
wait till you read this .
that' s my brother and me .
sorry .
i' m grisham , communications officer .
i know .
i read about you when you were with setl .
you must' ve been really desperate for entertainment .
the kind of stuff you guys are doing really interests me .
were doing .
it' s all history now .
i found the signal when they brought the block in here .
how' d you read it ?
when the weather' s good we use a landsat satellite .
it was in the background noise .
between 2 and 6 gigahertz ?
yeah , how' d you know ?
that' s where we always kind of expected it would be .
so you really think it' s artificial ?
i know it' s artificial .
could be an elaborate hoax .
could be .
hello , julian .
hello .
sit down .
thank you .
join us .
i' d like to get some coffee .
there .
there ?
great .
thank you .
who haven' t you met yet ?
i haven' t met anybody .
this is abell , our maintenance officer .
and these lovely ladies are shelly cline ...
hello .
hi . ... and dacia petrov .
i don' t think you' ve met dr. straub , julian .
you look much smaller with your clothes on .
you' re still here ?
yeah , for a while .
the weather seems to be getting worse .
you were employed by seti as a cryptologist .
what exactly do you do ?
it' s like an interpreter .
interpreting what ?
messages from outer space , my dear .
e. t. phone home .
cryptologists determine if a valid communication' s been received ... and then they try and decipher and interpret it .
just exactly how many signals have you interpreted ?
none , exactly .
since you' ve never heard from them , do you still believe they' re out there ?
do you believe in god ?
yes .
have you ever heard from him ?
no .
how about a drink ?
think i' m gonna turn in .
been kind of tired .
how iong do these communication biackouts iast ?
seen it go a couple of weeks before .
once in a while there' s intermittent signals ... that last long enough to make contact with the brits at mcmurdo .
till then we' re totally cut off ?
when it gets like this , nothing can get in or out .
sno cats are useless , and they wouldn' t chance an icebreaker .
i can' t believe how much it' s melted .
you can almost see inside it now .
am i crazy , or does this thing seem to be giving off a low grade impulse ?
i can feel it in my joints .
it' s really strong if you touch it .
careful .
was the signal harmonic when you first intercepted it ?
no .
what does that mean ?
two or more separate frequencies combined in one signal .
i think one' s a locator pulse and the other' s plain text .
an actual message .
it' s a lot of work just to create a hoax .
this is no hoax .
how long do you think it would take us to rig up some kind of a horn antenna ?
hard line here ?
if i can' t communicate with the satellite , i' il have to intercept the signal here .
there' s an old dismantled one in maintenance .
abell and me can rig it up in a few hours , i guess .
what are you gonna do ?
try and find out what' s buried in the harmonic .
how ?
mathematics .
any luck ?
no .
the primary signal' s ... almost too obvious .
it' s like some sort of beacon .
what' s your brother do ?
he' s dead .
i' m sorry .
he died in a flight training accident .
you guys train together ?
yeah .
i lost interest after the accident .
i' m gonna find a real bed .
think i ought to wake her ?
no , let her sleep .
beacon .
this is the signal we received from nasa yesterday .
now watch this .
what happened to the sound ?
nothing .
that was recorded by osler in ' 47 .
the signals appear identical .
same transmission , same frequency , same polytonal harmonics .
there' s no denying the similarities of these two events .
the moment a window of opportunity opens in that storm ... we have to make contact with this man rome .
because of his background , he' s the most likely to comprehend what we tell him .
bring bachman here immediately .
why ?
what mr. rome is going to hear is best heard from somebody he trusts .
what' s the matter ?
abell woke us up .
said it was something with the ice block .
what happened ?
i' ve never seen anything like this before .
looks like it was created in a volcanic environment .
looks like a big old clam .
a giant mollusk that ate antarctica .
it' s not a mollusk .
what is it ?
don' t touch it .
you all right ?
you okay ?
it' s got some sort of electrical charge to it .
i' d say it' s igneous rock formed by some sort of eruption .
my guess is rhyolite , or basalt .
it didn' t come from earth , it came from space .
it' s a meteorite .
meteorites don' t broadcast radio signals .
the signal' s harmonics are exactly like aircraft retrieval data .
it' s a black box .
first i thought it was a location bounce ... for celestial navigation , but it' s a little simplistic .
then grisham mentioned it seemed like a beacon , and that' s when it hit me .
this came here by mistake , and the signal' s meant for whoever lost it .
aliens .
this is nuts .
maybe not , michael .
it all makes sense .
there' s something else .
the primary signal is a cryptographic key ... that unlocks the message buried in the harmonic .
so i compared the cipher text against itself ... and the coincidences between the character strings .
a deviation arises ... from strings of intervals divisible by five , bit repeats at shifts of 70 and 125 .
what the hell are you talking about ?
i' m talking about this .
what ?
that ?
that' s a message ?
it' s part of a message .
this is the great pearl of galactic wisdom ... that we' ve all been waiting for .
i' ve been waiting for .
could there be more to the message that' s not being deciphered ?
there could be several cryptographic keys .
shift intervals can change , strings vary .
endless possibilities .
but it could still be uniquely random .
i just don' t think so .
yes , but it' s a possibility .
anything' s possible .
i think julian' s right .
it looks extraterrestrial .
you' re all talking nonsense .
no offense , nyla .
you wouldn' t know an eti if it walked up to you and bit you .
neither would you .
so why are you so goddamn sure that it' s not ?
alexie , what do you think ?
i agree with julian .
anything is possible .
everybody , i think you better come back down to the maintenance bay .
there appears to be a crease in this thing' s surface .
can we open it ?
if you can discharge it , i can pry it open .
i can rig up something to ground the charge .
maybe that' s not a good idea .
it' s a way to find out if you' re right .
i' m not so sure it' s a good idea , either .
there may be pathogenic organisms inside .
an infection could wipe out all our work .
the labs are sealed environments .
i say first thing tomorrow morning we pop this thing open .
if julian' s right , we go down in history .
if i' m right , we eat linguini for a week .
okay , bring him in .
welcome , dr. bachman .
please , have a seat .
i know this must be very unnerving for you .
yes , it is a bit , sir .
i can' t imagine why i should be brought here .
what we' re about to tell you , dr. bachman , is truly beyond your imagination .
you believe it' s eti in origin , don' t you ?
everything certainly points to it .
i hope you' re wrong , jules .
nobody' s called me that for a long time .
why do you hope i' m wrong ?
because if you' re right , we could be neanderthals in comparison .
that may not be so bad .
think of what we might learn from them .
maybe they won' t have the patience to teach us .
so it' il just be survival of the fittest .
same rationale we' ve used to kill everything below us on the food chain .
maybe they' re an even more effective predator than we are .
kate .
don' t .
you don' t know what i was gonna say .
you were gonna apologize again .
just let it go .
am i interrupting something ?
no .
we' re done .
was i interrupting something ?
it' s a long story .
will you do me a favor ?
i wanna ...
will you watch this program ?
i wanna grab a shower , get something to eat .
would you like some company ?
that would be nice .
but i better not .
see you in a bit .
be carefui with that thing .
now hold it still .
here .
is this gonna work ?
it should .
all right , let it drop .
turn it off !
something' s generating current inside of it , but it should be safe to work on .
would you like something to drink ?
some water , coffee ?
brandy .
brandy , please .
the weather systems have prevented us from making contact .
our satellite systems will alert us at the first opportunity .
what if this is really true ?
what if we' re already too late ?
we' ve considered that .
measures are being initiated as we speak .
new zealand , south paclfic ocean russlan ssgn submarlne
the message from the americans is properly formulated , sir .
all ahead two thirds .
set depth for six hundred feet .
all ahead two thirds .
depth set for six hundred feet .
commence heading two five zero .
sir .
commencing heading two five zero .
what do you think is inside it ?
nothing , i hope .
the blade' s cutting through a layer much softer than the outside surface .
what if he' s right ?
snap out of it , kate .
you don' t believe it any more than i do .
the only reason you' re going along with this insanity is because of him .
that' s not true .
it' s not rock .
it looks like a carbon alloy .
what caused the surface corrosion ?
water exposure ?
it appears more like a molten degeneration ... from exposure to extreme heat .
for god' s sake , alexie , you don' t know what the hell that thing is .
i' il tell you what .
i' m going down to the corn lab to work .
they don' t give nobel prizes for space junk .
anything ?
no , it just keeps returning to that .
what exactly is it doing ?
trying to speak .
it' s a language .
you know , language isn' t just used ... as a means to converse ... but also to define an environment so one can survive in it .
since time and space is a constant ... any intelligence within that environment will define it the same .
but with a different language ?
yeah .
i mean , mathematics is the basic expression of any language .
so you just have to find a way to solve the equations .
that' s what it' s doing , with the help of the cryptographic key from the signal .
it' s kind of like mindmaze .
like what ?
it' s a computer game ... where you have to figure out the math puzzles .
each time you do , you get a key that unlocks the door to another world .
what ?
maybe each piece of the message is its own key .
what do you mean ?
mindmaze .
maybe that' s how the intervals are interpreted .
it' s a progression ... using the last piece as the new key .
see .
now we use ... the new interval ... as the next key .
it' s working .
wait a minute .
what ?
oh , my god !
what do you think , abell ?
i think i' m getting there .
we' ve got to stop them .
what could be in it ?
i don' t know .
i' m cutting through a layer that' s much softer than the outside surface .
take over for me .
i need to get another blade .
here .
jack !
what' s wrong ?
we got to stop them .
don' t open it !
what the hell ?
are you okay ?
i' ve got the fire under control .
somebody help the doc .
is anybody hurt ?
i' m okay .
how about yourself ?
i' m all right .
careful , alexie .
anybody down there ?
i' m okay .
what about jack ?
i don' t know .
i can' t see him .
the whole place is a wreck .
where are some flashlights ?
i' il show you .
is anybody else hurt ?
i' ve got a few scratches .
i' m okay , but i lost carl .
i' m over here .
i' m all right .
i' m fine .
i' m okay .
where' s the kid ?
last time i saw him , he was on the stairs .
pinter , you okay ?
let' s get down there and see what happened .
is everybody accounted for ?
i don' t know .
you all right ?
yeah .
let me see your arm .
no , it' s okay .
it' s jack .
he' s dead .
you okay ?
yeah , i' m fine .
what is it ?
i' ve never seen technology like this .
it seems organic .
i think there' s something inside it .
what' re you gonna do ?
i want to see what it is .
no , wait .
look at that .
what' s it doing ?
oh , my god .
what the hell is that ?
what' s happening ?
what the hell is going on down here ?
we' re going down in history .
just like you said .
you think it' s dead ?
looks dead to me .
i don' t feel so well .
what the hell is going on ?
must be airborne .
the russians are in a depioyment firing position .
then we agree that the general will begin execution of a fail safe plan ...
without prejudice ?
but we hold until we make contact .
our submarine is equipped with underwater launch missiles with nuclear warheads .
they will be fired row by row .
it' s gotta be some sort of parasite .
viral ?
i think the infection is protozoan .
you saw what happened .
it ate tissue from the inside out .
there' s no protozoa can do that .
not here , not on earth .
i' ve been transmitting a mayday , but i can' t make contact through the storm .
we' re all gonna die , aren' t we ?
chances are we' ve all been infected , right ?
maybe not .
maybe nyla and the others somehow had some physical contact with the parasite .
i didn' t see anybody touching each other or anything else .
the only thing was that broom handle .
then he should' ve been infected .
maybe we' re resistant .
that' s possible , isn' t it ?
so is genetic flexibility .
what the hell' s she talking about ?
sometimes a disease will slow down its infection rate ... so it doesn' t kill the thing it needs to live on .
you mean if we' re all dead , it' il die , too ?
exactly .
that' s just great !
how long will these emergency batteries last ?
around 24 hours .
they' d last longer if we shut down parts of the station .
what area uses the most energy ?
the field labs .
we' re not shutting down the experiment .
i' d rather not myself , julian .
let' s start with the living quarters and the maintenance bay .
it' s gone .
what ?
the thing , it' s gone .
so it is alive .
where is it ?
it must still be somewhere in the bay .
what do we do ?
we find it .
no way .
i' m not going looking for that thing .
the infectious chain might be contact .
then go with kate and start shutting down the generators .
shouldn' t we take some sort of weapon ?
are there any firearms here ?
the pilots have two 9 millimeters in their gear .
i checked them in .
it' s part of our survival kit .
let' s get them .
the fallout radius of this campaign can exceed our extraction numbers ... because of the other stations .
while we argue about the fine print , we' il be on our way to a global annihilation .
gentlemen , the weather satellite shows ... a small hole developing in the storm front within the hour .
this may be our last opportunity .
i' m getting the creeps .
don' t worry , we' il be fine .
tell that to nyla and the others .
why don' t we split up ?
this is just great .
kate , shine that flashlight .
kate , where did you go ?
what ?
jeez .
you scared the hell out of me !
i shut down the power grid .
just don' t sneak up on me like that , okay ?
let' s go to the machine room and check the generators .
stay close .
what will we do with it when we find it ?
the question is ... what will it do with us ?
i think it' s these three .
it' s all right .
you see ?
i' m not gonna hurt you .
my god !
julian !
kill it !
don' t do this .
stop !
i thought it was gonna kill you .
i don' t think so .
it felt ... safe .
and then ... it felt like fear .
there it goes again .
maybe finally we can get the hell out of here .
with this weather , nobody will be able to fly in .
we can' t fly out either .
we shouldn' t go till we know about the pathogen .
you don' t decide anything for me .
calm down .
he' s right , michael .
no one leaves .
rundeii peak , this is uss crowley .
come in .
rundeii peak , do you read ?
over .
uss crowiey , this is rundell peak .
we read you .
go ahead for rundell peak .
this is dr. bachman .
yes , it' s me .
i' m here in washington ... with the secretary of defense ... and some other men .
this is about the alien , isn' t it ?
my god , it' s true .
then i assume you' ve opened it .
how many fataiities ?
two by accident , four by infection .
the seven of us left seem to have a resistance to it .
at least for the time being .
have they contaminated the environment outside the station ?
has the environment outside the station been compromised ?
no one' s been outside .
what' s going on , john ?
what' s happening ?
john , are you still there ?
what you found in the ice was an escape pod ... simiiar to our own aircraft ejection system .
on the night of july 2 , 1947 ... a similar vehicle entered the earth' s atmosphere .
it landed near roswell , new mexico ... and started transmitting a rescue signal .
when they were retrieving the unopened pod ... a ham radio operator named gordon osier ... stumbied on the frequency signai , the same as you did .
he drove out to the source of the transmission .
the aiiens are carriers of the pathogen , but they themseives are immune to it .
they were unaware of this until they entered our planetary system .
their first stop was mars .
total extinction took less than six months .
how do they communicate ?
is it some form of telepathy ?
yes .
they never ieft their craft .
the recovery was robotic .
but they made it clear that night ... that they desperately wanted to assimilate with us .
did you contact it ?
is it stiii aiive ?
it' s dead .
none of that matters anymore .
the solution now is sterilization .
what do you mean , sterilization ?
it' s been decided .
a limited nuclear device is our only option .
tell them that help is on the way .
no .
i will not lie to them .
we' ve got no choice .
god knows what they' il go through in the next few hours .
they have a right to know what' il happen to them .
tell the truth , and i guarantee the integrity of that station will be compromised .
a russian ... submarine is on its way to you .
how the hell can they help us ?
they' re not coming here to help us .
how iong do we have ?
three hours .
i' m so sorry , juiian .
thank you , dr. bachman .
i know how hard that was for you .
no way !
they can' t do this .
they just can' t kill us all .
i say we load the plane and we take our chances .
unless the weather improves our chances are slim .
no one' s going anywhere .
we walk out of here , we can infect the entire planet .
we' re not infected , for christ' s sake !
can you prove that ?
lf we were , we would be dead .
somehow we' ve managed to develop a resistance .
what about running blood panels on us to verify it ?
protozoa is known to disguise itself in cellular protein .
could we be resistant ?
possibly .
but shelly is right .
we could be part of some hidden cycle of replication .
infectious without any symptoms .
it' s nothing but theoretical bullshit !
we see it in plant resistance all the time .
introduce a pathogen , some die immediately ... while others quickly develop antigens against the infection .
every minute we waste is a minute we could spend further away from here .
everyone stays put until shelly runs the blood panels .
then we decide what to do .
why don' t you go help her get set up in the med lab ?
i don' t fucking believe it .
it must be some sort of drill , sir .
weapons conn .
eam is properly formatted for strategic missile launch .
plot a firing solution and initiate standby firing point procedures .
i hope you' re right , mr. volkv .
there' s no sign of any pathogen .
are you sure ?
look for yourself .
there' s nothing but healthy cells .
it could be hidden in the protein .
you know how unlikely that is .
how unlikely ?
what are the odds ?
99 . 999 to the infinite .
but not 100 ?
for christ' s sake , what are we waiting for ?
i say we get out of here now .
what do you think , alexie ?
without absolute proof it would be incredibly irresponsible .
i don' t know .
what do you think ?
lf there' s no sign of it , i agree with you .
there' s two .
come on , kate .
do you want to die for nothing ?
no , i don' t .
but if there' s a chance we can spread this , we have no choice .
are you out of your mind ?
there' s no sign of it in our blood .
what more fucking proof do you need ?
i' m not going anywhere with you .
you stupid , fucking bitch !
give your gun to grisham .
why ?
because only you can fly the plane .
that' s all the more reason for me to keep it .
give your gun to grisham .
when i arrived , i noticed the main entry port has a keypad to open and close .
is the maintenance bay port the same ?
yeah , why ?
i think we should reprogram the codes in case someone decides to try and leave .
i' il show you how .
first , you need to punch in the existing code , which is 7942 .
it' s waiting for the open command .
four number combination , then depress the first and the third pads till they light up .
now the maintenance bay .
okay .
how long till we reach launch coordinates ?
eighteen minutes , captain .
lock firing solution into computer and set condition 1 ktx for strategic missile launch .
firing solution locked into computer and condition 1 ktx set for strategic missile launch , sir .
gentlemen , the release of a nuclear weapon has been authorized .
this is not a drill .
are you okay , michael ?
no .
i' m not okay .
how long since we spoke to bachman ?
over an hour .
we don' t have much time then .
this is insane .
if they were able to reach us on the radio , there must be a hole in the storm front .
i' m increasingly convinced we could make it out of here on the plane .
lf we could get to it .
fuck the entry ports .
there' s another way out of here .
so now we wait ?
now we wait .
wish i had a cigarette .
those things will kill you .
you always made me laugh .
i' m not ready to die .
you can' t do this .
stop it !
get the gun !
get the fucking gun !
please , stop !
let' s go !
let' s get on out !
run to the plane !
they' re heading for the plane .
they can' t get out .
the ports are locked .
no , julian , they' re going through the irrigation drains .
what' s he talking about ?
the cornfields .
you' ve got to stop them , julian .
go .
i' m okay .
i' m all right .
shelly , take care of kate .
ship is at launch depth , sir .
flood tubes and spin up ballistic missiles one through five .
mark depth , two hundred feet .
i hope to hell they know what they' re doing .
weapons conn .
fire one .
it' s away .
god help us .
come on .
let' s go .
we' ve got to get out of here .
we don' t have much time .
come on !
wait a minute .
we don' t have time to waste !
my god .
they were right .
we are infected .
so , we' re infected .
it doesn' t mean we' il die .
it might mean that others will .
i can' t do this .
i' m not going .
yes , you are .
who' s gonna fly the plane ?
you want to stay here and wait and be blown into oblivion ... when we have a chance to get out of here ?
now let' s go !
no .
and you' re not going either .
michael , don' t do this !
michael , you can' t go outside .
stop !
look at the corn !
come on .
don' t do this !
help me , julian .
what' s happening ?
help me .
don' t move .
we' re suffocating .
i can' t breathe .
breathe slowly .
i can' t breathe .
be still .
i can' t breathe .
nine minutes to target impact !
come on , let' s go .
go where ?
we' re out of time , we got to go .
you all right ?
we' il use the maintenance bay door .
are you okay , alexie ?
julian , what' s going on ?
where are we going ?
where' s michael ?
he' s dead .
nearly there .
it' s hard to breathe .
breathe slowly .
your lungs will get used to it until we' re inside .
inside what ?
my god !
what do we do now ?
they want us to go with them .
time' s running out .
i' m scared , jules .
i' m scared , too .
just hold on .
and don' t let go .
there are unconfirmed reports now ... that the disaster at the nasa facility in the antarctic ... was the result of a massive meltdown of a nuclear reactor .
a spokesman at the pentagon says more information will be forthcoming soon .
and we hear now that there is a presidential press conference ... scheduled for 7 : 30 eastern time tonight .
we can confirm that 13 people in all died .
among them was the renowned geneticist ...
dr. alexie glerach , drs. katherine brecher ... and michael straub ... highly respected researchers in the field of plant genetics .
professor rome had only recently arrived at the nasa facility ... and it' s still unclear exactly what his function was .
