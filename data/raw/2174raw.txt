i can' t say what made me fall in love with vietnam .
that a woman' s voice can drug you ?
that everything is so intense the colours , the taste , even the rain ?
nothing like the filthy rain in london .
they say whatever you' re looking for you will find here .
they say you come to vietnam and you understand a lot in a few minutes .
but the rest has got to be lived .
the smell , that' s the first thing that hits you promising everything in exchange for your soul .
and the heat .
your shirt is straight away a rag .
you can hardly remember your name , or what you came to escape from .
but at night , there' s a breeze .
the river is beautiful .
you could be forgiven for thinking there was no war , that the gunshots were fireworks , that only pleasure matters .
a pipe of opium , or the touch of a girl who might tell you she loves you .
and then something happens , as you knew it would , and nothing can ever be the same again .
monsieur fowler .
thank you for coming in .
i' m sorry to ask you at this hour .
i know about as much as you do .
he' s an american .
he' s about 30 .
he works for the economic aid mission .
and i like him .
he' s a very good chap .
serious .
not like those noisy bastards down at the continental .
he' s a quiet american .
yes .
a very quiet american .
he' s dead , isn' t he ?
not guilty .
i just put two and two together .
he was killed by a knife .
can you identify him ?
yes .
he was ... a friend .
to tell you the truth , i' m not completely sorry .
these americans are causing a lot of trouble to us .
but still , a murder is a murder .
anything to help us ?
no .
nothing at all .
please .
pyle ...
est mort .
assassinated .
how ?
he was stabbed .
yes .
he was in love with me .
yes .
he was .
i' m so sorry , phuong .
i go to my mother' s .
i must think .
i met pyle where you meet everybody at the hotel continental .
i' m there every morning at 11 . 00 .
i' m english .
i have habits .
i drink tea .
i' m a reporter , so i listen .
i have a lover .
i like to watch her arrive at the milk bar .
and there was alden pyle .
a face with no history and no problems .
the face we all had once .
i' m alden pyle .
i' m thomas fowler .
the london times .
you' ve done your homework .
i' ve read your articles .
may i join you ?
please .
and what brings you to saigon , mr pyle ?
i' m with the economic aid mission , on the medical side .
eye disease .
do know trachoma ?
it' s very common here .
very easy to treat .
are you staying at the hotel ?
no .
i just dropped by for tea .
on the way to the office .
this is really a stroke of luck for me .
you' re one of the few correspondents who goes out into the field to see what' s happening .
not any more .
besides , i have never thought of myself as a correspondent .
i' m just a reporter .
i offer no point of view .
i take no action .
i don' t get involved .
i just report what i see .
but you must have an opinion .
even an opinion is a form of action .
still , i' d appreciate ...
pyle was hungry for everything i could tell him about vietnam and her fight for independence .
why were the french losing the war ?
and why were the communists winning ?
then he saw phuong .
i should have realised how saving a country and saving a woman could be the same thing to someone like pyle .
we' ve got to contain communism .
what could be done , what should be done , what he thought , what he' d read .
he made me remember there was a time when i had wanted to make a difference .
to watch liberty snuffed out ?
" liberty " is a western word .
how do you define it for the vietnamese ?
the freedom to choose .
ok , you give them that , they vote and they elect ho chi minh .
things are more complicated than they seem .
what was that ?
a grenade .
it sounded like a car backfiring .
a week here , you' il know the difference .
it' s been a genuine pleasure meeting you .
maybe we could eat dinner .
i look forward to it .
great .
good morning .
morning , hinh .
anything new ?
oh , corruption , mendacity ...
i said new .
there is a rumour that the communists are planning an attack in the north , at phat diem .
one of your contacts ?
yes , sir .
and a telegram .
from the london office .
mr stemins .
he says the paper has conducted a review of the foreign desk .
he wants you based in london .
christ .
i thought you liked london , sir .
i do , but i like it just where it is .
i don' t want to bloody go there .
for what ?
a desk job ?
they probably think it' s cheaper to let the wire services cover vietnam .
how many stories have we given them ?
this year ?
yes .
three .
oh , shit .
maybe ...
i should go up there .
where , sir ?
phat diem .
it' s not an easy place to get into , with the communist attack .
send a cable to stemins .
understand your current concern .
stop .
am working on a story of major proportions .
stop .
suggest i remain in saigon until completed .
stop .
fowler .
which story is that , sir ?
i don' t know .
but i' m sure you know someone who can get me in there .
today our anniversary .
did you forget ?
can it be two years already ?
yes .
yes ?
be careful with me .
i' m old and fragile .
not so old .
not so fragile .
tom !
thomas .
hello .
hello again .
i' m here with some friends .
care to join us ?
phuong , this is mr pyle .
alden , please .
you know joe tunney , from the american legation .
yes , i know joe .
overthrown any small countries recently ?
fowler sees conspiracies everywhere .
that' s for sure .
is it true that the communists are attacking phat diem ?
how the fuck should i know ?
we only report victories .
one of our medical teams wasn' t allowed past phnom penh .
i was thinking of going up there .
it' s a catholic town , isn' t it ?
you got a date tonight ?
bill ...
she' s got a date every night .
you got your piece of ass .
i want mine .
pyle , fellas , let' s go to the house of 500 girls .
oh , no thanks .
i was planning on taking them to dinner .
we' ve already booked at the arc en ciel .
that' s great .
you go eat at the l' arc en ciel and i' il get eaten next door .
sounds like a plan .
come on , bill .
walk with me .
seems like a nice young man .
what does he do ?
something with medical aid .
you go and get us a table and i' il go and rescue our mr pyle .
thank you .
i' m not staying .
just dropping him off .
pyle !
let' s get out of here .
put your arm around this one .
if they think you' ve chosen one , they' il let you go .
put your arm around her .
night , granger !
who wants the money most ?
miss phuong , please forgive us for keeping you waiting .
i forgive you .
we had to make sure bill got home .
home !
number 30 ?
sorry ?
tickets for the taxi dancers .
you buy a ticket for a dance .
buy a ticket .
maybe i dance with you .
there you are .
shall we ?
phuong is a very beautiful name .
it mean phoenix .
i thought it meant flower .
like the ones in your hair .
do you like my hair ?
this is traditional style .
it' s very nice .
do you know vietnamese ?
sure .
try me .
no .
i don' t ...
i only know two words .
mr fowler .
hello .
may i ?
of course .
thanks .
haven' t seen you for a long time .
i' m away a lot .
yes .
who' s he ?
your friend ?
his name is pyle .
he' s with the american economic mission .
he' s from boston .
in america .
he' s a very bad dancer .
yes .
he is married ?
not that i know of , no .
this is phuong' s sister .
alden pyle .
very happy to meet you .
your father is a business man ?
no .
he' s a professor .
my sister is very good dancer , yes ?
she' s too good for me .
she' s my only sister .
your sister' s a very pretty girl .
my sister is the most beautiful girl in saigon .
i don' t doubt that at all .
mr fowler' s a very lucky man .
my father was very sad he had no grandchildren .
would you like a drink ?
no .
thank you .
my friends .
so pleased to have met you .
i hope we meet again soon .
perhaps you could arrange .
when i get back from the north .
you are going north ?
yes .
then you must come and have dinner with me and my sister when mr fowler is gone .
to cheer her up .
thank you .
i' d like that very much .
what a nice woman .
absolute saint .
she used to work in office .
import export .
really ?
she knows shorthand .
does she ?
maybe you need someone .
maybe we could work something out .
please forgive me for dancing with miss phuong so many times .
i like watching her dance .
she' s a very good dancer .
she should be .
she used to do it for a living .
what do you mean ?
she was a taxi dancer .
a hostess .
here at the arc en ciel .
i thought you said she came from a good family .
she did , but the father died so the sisters had to earn a living .
well , that' s too bad .
what ?
isn' t that just a step up from the girls across the street ?
good god , no .
it took me six months to get her to go on a date .
grenade .
so are you married ?
yes , i am .
but not to her .
there' s something i haven' t told you .
i got a telegram from the paper , asking me to go back to london .
so will you go ?
i' ve cabled them , asking them to let me stay , but ... if they stop paying me ,
i' m not sure how we' il live .
i come with you to london .
i' d marry you if i could .
you know that .
yes .
that' s what i always tell my sister .
you think your wife will give divorce ?
i doubt it .
when did everything change ?
maybe there isn' t one moment .
the cable from london calling me home ?
or watching them dancing together ?
or what followed between us , she and i , through the long night ?
i was never brave .
but there i was , heading north , the fear of losing phuong more terrifying than the fear of any bullet .
the communists attacked four days ago .
we pushed them back only yesterday .
we think there is 300 in this village .
but you will not see them .
it' s getting worse , isn' t it ?
how long can you keep going ?
a few months , maybe .
my men are counting bullets .
no , no !
don' t shoot !
what the hell are you doing here ?
they wouldn' t let my truck out of phnom penh so i figured i' d see what was going on for myself .
you' re lucky to get here alive .
it wasn' t that hard after i hired a boat .
it wasn' t expensive .
in the end i just bought it .
you are mad .
i' m mad ?
yes .
have you ever seen anyone with trachoma ?
yes , i suppose i have .
it' s not that easy to remain uninvolved .
this way .
not that easy to remain uninvolved .
i had hidden for so long behind a typewriter .
what we found there , what we saw , in phat diem .
what did that do ?
to his zeal , to my detachment ?
the dead are not involved .
the dead have no zeal .
they are lying in wait .
you see them , all their tenderness , and then they haunt you .
communists ?
this is not the work of french soldiers .
it doesn' t make sense .
the communists don' t kill townspeople .
it is not in their interest .
maybe another faction .
there are so many of them .
each with their own army .
what' s that book you' re always reading ?
york harding .
the dangers to democracy .
an american ?
yeah .
he was out here a couple of years back .
was he here long ?
i don' t know .
i heard him lecture once .
joe actually met him .
he put forward the idea of a third force to run vietnam .
not the communists and not the french .
not the americans ?
no .
we' re not colonialists .
something that could really help these people .
you have a gun , either of you ?
no .
they shall attack again tonight .
you don' t want to be taken alive .
believe me .
shoot yourselves .
thank you .
thanks .
stay inside that bunker .
do you want something to eat ?
no , thank you .
come on .
you didn' t come up to check your medical team .
joe tunney sent you , right ?
a little intelligence work .
i' ve never have been very good at keeping secrets .
there is another reason why i came up here .
it' s you .
me ?
yeah .
you said that you might be coming up here .
the thing is , it' s about phuong .
well , i guess it started that night when we were at the arc en ciel and i was dancing with her .
i didn' t think you ever got close enough .
and then i had dinner with her and her sister that saturday and ... just when i was sitting there looking at her , it all just became so clear to me .
i see .
look , tom , none of this was planned .
there' s no way ...
i never ever used to believe in love at first sight .
but after seeing those other girls in that awful place and thinking that phuong could easily become one of them ,
i want to protect her .
what did she say when you offered her your protection ?
i haven' t told her yet .
you haven' t ?
no .
i didn' t think it would be right .
i wanted to speak with you first .
look , if you two were married that would be completely different .
i can never marry her .
oh , shit !
my wife would never give me a divorce .
she' s a catholic .
they' re getting closer .
they' re walking in .
dear thomas i guess i' il be back in saigon ahead of you .
and i wanted to reassure you that i won' t go to see phuong until after you return .
if you can make the next transport out , you should be back by the end of the week .
i can check in with your assistant to see if you made it .
if so , i' il come around to see you both together on friday .
say 5 . 00 ?
anyone due to go out to hong kong ?
someone from reuters , i believe .
type this up and ask him to cable it to london for me .
your big story ?
yes .
massacre at phat diem .
nobody did it , of course .
not the french , not the communists ...
but there are rumours .
what' s going on ?
i forgot .
what ?
it' s a rally .
a new political party .
bloody hell .
i think i' d better leave your car here , sir .
we can walk .
isn' t that colonel th ?
general th .
who made him a general ?
he did .
he broke away from the french and formed his own army .
hello .
hi .
you have a dog .
come in .
thanks .
where' s phuong ?
she' s gone to see her sister .
would you like a whisky ?
just a soda , thanks .
does he have to do that ?
duke !
come here .
you called him duke .
yeah .
i found this guy in the street .
didn' t i ?
who could turn their back on a mug like that ?
i saw you and joe tunney at the parade .
did you go on to the rally ?
thanks .
yeah , i did .
it was really something else .
i thought only american politicians went in for that nonsense .
all that was missing was the ticker tape .
they sure didn' t forget the brass band .
impressive guy , that general th .
it doesn' t trouble you that he' s a complete egomaniac ?
look , i don' t want to talk about phuong behind her back .
i thought she was going to be here , but ...
her sister told me about her predicament .
and what predicament is that ?
i think you know .
you can' t marry her , and by living with you she can never have a proper marriage to a vietnamese man .
she doesn' t need a proper marriage with a vietnamese man .
she' s with me .
here she is .
hello , phuong .
my sister is out .
hello .
hello .
it' s nice to see you .
it' s you that mr pyle has come to visit , phuong .
so why don' t we all sit down ?
unless , of course , you want me to leave .
no .
that wouldn' t be right .
we should sit down , then .
fire away .
ever since i met you and danced with you and talked with you ,
i haven' t been able to get you out of my thoughts for more than a moment .
i' ve fallen in love with you .
you fall in love with me ?
please believe me .
i' ve never behaved like this before .
i apologise .
it is abrupt and it is ill mannered , but ...
i' m in love with you .
shouldn' t you be on one knee ?
look ...
phuong , i' m not a rich man but i do have assets .
let' s toss for her .
what can you offer her ?
oh , christ .
i don' t expect you to love me right away .
you could always make love to the chauffeur .
you have no right to insult her !
shut your bloody dog up .
come away with me .
tell him to bugger off and take his dog with him .
no .
did you say no ?
yes .
sit down and have a scotch .
no .
i should go .
i' m so sorry .
do you want to smoke a pipe ?
a pipe ?
opium .
no .
why would i do that ?
i know before we married you warned me beliefs meant that there could never be a divorce .
all the same , that' s what i' m asking for now .
the fact is , i love someone very much .
i want you to feel affection and act before you have time to think .
just cable and tell me you agree .
i' ve just asked my wife for a divorce .
your sister ...
was she really out ?
i told you .
i thought perhaps she sent you back so that you could meet pyle .
he' s very young .
that' s not so important .
good news .
they printed your story .
i got a cable from stemins .
this got me a month' s reprieve .
page ten .
french break communist siege .
they didn' t use much , did they ?
nothing here about the villagers that were killed .
what did the french papers say ?
headlines blame it on the communists , of course .
well , a month is a month .
what else can you tell me about this general th ?
he' s set himself up against both the french and the communists .
do you think he' d give me an interview if i went up there ?
difficult to say .
perhaps if he thought he could get his message across .
the problem would be getting it past the censor .
no , the real problem would be to get close to the cambodian border and back before dark .
the communists control that road at night .
so many europeans have been killed out there .
i am thomas fowler of the london times and i' m here to interview general th .
i' m thomas fowler of the london times .
i' m here to see general th .
september , october , november ...
i' d seen pyle only once since he' d asked phuong to marry him , at the continental .
he' d been polite , of course how was i , how was phuong ?
he' d been busy , he said , out of the city , working on his medical programme .
though somehow , i wasn' t surprised to see him .
i was surprised to be pleased to see him .
what brings you out to these parts ?
i was hoping to interview the general .
but they' ve thrown me out of the place .
what' s your excuse this time ?
this is like a test run for us .
the french , in their typically french way , have been very uncooperative but general th has been good enough to let us set up camp here .
i' il get them to let you in .
joe tunney' s running aid programmes with business people close to th .
mr muoi .
mr pyle .
hello .
how are you ?
good .
my name is mr muoi .
the general only has a few moments .
may i first ask you a question ?
please .
what is your relationship to the general ?
i' m a businessman and a patriot .
many of the supplies and aid you see are the result of my efforts .
shall we begin ?
you say you' ve broken away from the french and vietnamese forces with which you serve .
do any ties remain ?
the french are colonialists .
not to be trusted .
it will take an independent vietnamese leader to rule our country .
how does the general expect to launch a successful campaign against the larger forces of the communists and the french with so few men and supplies ?
and who is providing the means for the general to achieve this ?
has he been fighting his war in the north ?
there was a massacre at phat diem .
were your forces present ?
regrettably the general has just recalled that he has an urgent appointment .
so , please .
thank you .
that was quick .
things didn' t go entirely according to plan .
watch yourself with joe .
i think he' s up to something with general th .
can i get a ride to saigon with you ?
something' s wrong with my car .
yes , of course you can .
hello .
some kind soul has had mine cleaned .
i heard a rumour that you' d been recalled to london .
really ?
who told you that ?
phuong' s sister .
shit .
what is it ?
we' re out of petrol .
some bugger up in the mountains must have siphoned it off .
they might have some spare petrol in that watchtower .
it looks like it' s deserted .
i' il go in and have a look .
hello ?
is everything ok ?
come up .
what are you thinking ?
i was wondering what she was doing right now .
this morning she met her friends for elevenses at la fontaine .
ice cream and the latest gossip .
on her way home she stopped at the market for fresh fish for dinner .
and now she' s flipping through the pages of magazines
iooking at photographs of the royal family and film stars ,
listening to bach' s well tempered clavier .
i just got her started on bach .
have you had a lot of women , thomas ?
you start out by being promiscuous , and end up like your grandfather faithful to one woman .
i know i' m not essential to phuong .
but believe me when i tell you that if i were to lose her , for me ... it would be the beginning of death .
somebody' s had it .
there are 30 or 40 of these towers between here and saigon .
they only hit one or two a night so our odds aren' t too bad .
so what do you think they' d do if the communists attacked ?
these two ?
they' d fire a shot and run .
why should they die for us ?
or the french .
what' s that ?
i thought i saw something move .
christ , they' re here !
as far as i can make out , he told them to give us up or else .
stop !
give me that !
come on , thomas .
what is it ?
i think i' ve twisted my ankle .
i' m gonna head up the road to the next watchtower .
see if i can find a french patrol .
sit tight , ok ?
i' il be back .
may i introduce myself ?
thomas fowler .
i found a patrol .
if i had died ... you could have had her .
and i think you should inform your sources that general th has a lot more men than the hundred of their count .
he' s a story we should take seriously .
never underestimate a patriot , sir .
what do you know about muoi ?
could he finance th' s army ?
he owns a bicycle factory !
well , i think joe tunney is plotting with he and th .
and it' s more than just foreign aid programmes .
i' il see what i can find out , sir .
things are under control at the office .
try to get some rest .
thank you , hinh .
i missed you .
are you all right ?
i' m all in one piece .
you got a letter from london .
yes ?
i fetch it for you ?
no .
give me a kiss .
big one .
i will get it .
you look afraid .
i think i' d better have a brandy and soda .
pyle .
come in , come in .
thought i' d drop by and see how you were doing .
very well , thanks .
how' s the leg ?
my tennis game will suffer , but it wasn' t much to begin with .
thank you .
i' m glad you dropped by .
we have to thank mr pyle , phuong , for saving my life .
thank you .
how' s your sister doing ?
sister ?
yes .
alden got her a job with americans .
oh , yes ?
she likes it very much .
thank you .
good .
i' m very glad .
since you' re both here , now is as good a time as any to tell you that i have received a letter from my wife and she has more or less agreed to give me a divorce .
that' s wonderful .
come sit .
thank you .
i' ve got plans .
thank you for dropping by .
bye .
sir , i ...
i trusted you , thomas .
always a mistake when there' s a woman involved .
couldn' t you have won without lying ?
what is it , anyway ?
my sister read the letter from your wife .
i show it to her because ...
i was so proud .
so happy .
how could you treat her like this ?
dear thomas you always picked up women
like you picked up mud on your shoes .
i' m sorry , phuong .
so then why' d you lie to her ?
because i wanted to keep her .
that' s not love .
have you ever stopped to think how lonely she' il be in england when you leave her ?
shut up , for christ' s sake .
i don' t believe in divorce .
my religion forbids it .
and so the answer is no .
i was taught never to read other people' s letters .
i was taught not to tell lies .
come on , phuong .
i don' t speak vietnamese .
get lost .
you were right about muoi .
he does have connections .
can we discuss this some other time ?
crates from overseas have been moving through his factory , bypassing french customs .
my sources have been unable to determine what they contain .
he' s probably got someone on the take .
he' s an exporter , not an importer .
yes , well , we' il do that tomorrow , ok ?
no .
a shipment just came in this afternoon .
it could be gone by the morning .
what is this diolacton ?
we must leave immediately .
what are you doing ?
trying to save your life .
go !
good morning .
can i help you ?
you' ve done quite enough already .
where' s pyle ?
he' s not in the office this morning .
he does a lot of work at home .
i know what he does at home .
what do you mean ?
ask her .
she' s fixed him up with my girl .
we can' t have scenes in the office .
i know i am behaving badly .
but i have every intention of behaving badly .
this is exactly the kind of situation where one should behave badly .
could we please lower our voices ?
why don' t you bugger off ?
thomas , there is a lady here .
this lady and i know each other quite well .
she tried to get a rake off from me , but now she' s getting one from pyle .
we have a lot of work to do .
if pyle phones , tell him i called .
it would be polite to return the visit .
how did he get in here ?
this is boston ?
no , that' s niagara falls .
so is that .
this is boston .
that' s faneuil hall .
i can' t wait to take you to my country .
my friend from school .
she go to airport with her boyfriend .
he said he' d take her to france .
but in the airport , he disappear , leave her there .
so many girls with french boyfriend , no one to marry them .
well , that' il never happen to you .
i promise .
hi .
have a nice christmas ?
one long party .
did phuong forget something ?
heard you came by the legation .
yes .
who' s this ?
bodyguard .
we all have them now .
are you married yet ?
no , i figured i' d wait until we got home and do it properly .
you don' t mind living here improperly ?
it' s hard to talk if you' re going to be so cynical .
i meant it' d be good to do it with my parents there .
i had a cable from head office .
they want me back .
oh , that' s ...
so it' s good that phuong went off with you .
she might have ended up as another piece of arse for someone like granger .
at least i know you' il treat her right .
so does this mean that we can still be friends ?
i don' t see why not .
so what is diolacton , anyway ?
you know about that ?
shouldn' t i ?
well ...
diolacton is a milk based plastic .
it' s used for the frames in the eyeglasses .
are you still in touch with general th ?
we keep the channels open .
and muoi ?
mr muoi' s helped get our supplies through customs .
the french have started to charge for ...
you asked me for advice once .
here it is .
leave the bloody third force to joe , forget york harding , and go home with phuong .
and would you shut the door on the way out , please ?
morning , larry .
what is it today ?

i don' t know .
my friend is in there .
did you cut your hand , sir ?
yes .
how is it down there ?
30 dead .
probably 20 more by morning .
they' ve started arresting communist sympathisers .
there was a woman .
with a baby .
she covered it with her hat .
this man ... he died .
right in front of his family .
pyle ...
did you see him ?
he spoke vietnamese .
like ... like it was his , you know , native language .
murray !
come over here !
get this .
move it .
right here .
on this side .
understand ?
go make yourself useful somewhere else .
diolacton is a milk based plastic .
we used it for the frames .

dangers to democracy . " he put forward the idea of a third force ...
used in the manufacture of imitation tortoiseshell and jade .

joe tunney' s running aid programmes with business people close to th .
muoi .
and th .
it will take an independent vietnamese leader to rule our country .
the americans have been supplying them with materials to make bombs .
fowler sees conspiracies everywhere .
i have some contacts who would like to speak to your friend .
joe tunney ?
pyle ?
they feel he can give them important information about all this .
you' re saying pyle is oss ?
i believe the new name is the cla .
anyone could speak to him .
it' s not so easy .
he' s followed by protectors .
but if you asked to meet with him , man to man , he would come along .
these contacts .
are they communist ?
officially , no .
unofficially , yes .
i don' t know .
suppose you invite him to dinner at the vieux moulin , say between 9 . 00 and 9 . 30 .
it' s quiet near there .
my friends can speak to him undisturbed .
maybe he' s engaged .
at 6 . 30 , my contacts will have someone in the street outside your apartment .
all you have to do , if you decide to invite him to dinner ... go to the window and open a book .
what will they do to him ?
i promise you my contacts will act as gently as the situation allows .
sooner or later , mr fowler , one has to take sides if one is to remain human .
i need to speak to you about what happened this morning in the place garnier .
phuong .
a letter for you .
thank you .
just give me a few minutes , all right ?
come in .
i got your message .
so i see .
i' d love a drink .
i' ve only got hard liquor .
you' re probably on duty .
i' ve noticed you' re rarely off duty these days .
whisky' d be fine .
people change .
or maybe they just never were what we thought they were .
who of us is , thomas ?
who of us is ?
you want to talk about general th ?
yes .
and mr muoi .
and diolacton .
we met with th this afternoon .
he' s in saigon ?
come to see how his explosives worked ?
his original target was a military parade .
we were pretty tough on him .
did you tell him you wouldn' t support him ?
we told him if he steps out of line again ...
he tried to kill you on the road to saigon .
no .
he tried to kill you .
you knew ?
i suspected that he might try something .
or one of his officers .
so i tagged along just in case .
you' re a fool if you think you can control general th .
in a war , you use the tools you' ve got .
right now , he' s the best we have .
and in the meantime , even more people must die .
last year the us government gave $210 million in military assistance to the french in indochina .
if we are going to stop communism and underwrite a third way , we need to give the people a leader who they admire .
tomorrow when congress reads the sees the photographs of the communist atrocities , they are going to give us that support .
the french won' t stop the communists .
they haven' t got the brains and they haven' t got the guts .
how did i fit into all this ?
am i part of your cover ?
or a source of information ?
or did you have your eye on phuong all the time ?
you and phuong ?
i never planned for any of that to happen .
believe me .
it would have been easier if i' d never met either one of you .
but you did .
and you lied to us .
what do you want me to tell you ?
that i took no action ?
that i have no opinion ?
tell me that you don' t mean any of this .
tell me that you were only obeying orders .
or tell me that after what you saw in the square , those children , who did nothing and hurt no one , tell me that you were so confused and horrified at how brutal and insane these actions are .
tell me how your love for phuong has caused you to have some doubts .
but it' s because of phuong that i am even more determined .
let' s just look at phuong .
there' s beauty .
there' s daughter of a professor .
taxi dancer .
mistress of an older european man .
that pretty well describes the whole country .
look , thomas , we are here to save vietnam from all of that .
what happened in the square makes me sick .
but in the long run , i' m going to save lives .
it' s you , isn' t it ?
joe tunney , the staff at the legation ,
mr muoi , general th .
they all take their fucking orders from you , pyle .
york harding prattles on about a third force in that book you carry around .
you' ve actually gone out and made one .
i don' t think you see the big picture , thomas .
no , i do not see the big picture .
do you know this poem ?
i walk down the street and i don' t give a damn
the people , they stare and they ask who i am
and if by chance i should run over a cad
i can pay for the damage , if ever so bad .
we can disagree and remain friends , can' t we , thomas ?
yes .
look , i' m sorry .
let' s have dinner and put all this mess behind us .
9 . 00 , vieux moulin .

that sounds great .
i miss our conversations .
vieux moulin it is .

i' il tell phuong she can have dinner with her sister .
i' il get her to meet me here afterwards .
look , if you can' t make it , come straight here .
i' il wait for you .
all right .
i' il see you soon , thomas .

i need to talk to somebody who speaks english .
you see , it' s my son' s birthday tonight .
we need to ask you some questions .
i' m from the american legation .
i just try and help people see .
the thing is , i ...
i got a cable from my wife .
my boy has polio .
they don' t know if he' s going to make it .
i don' t care if he' s crippled .
i just don' t want him to die .
i' m sorry .
i' ve just got to get some air .
at least 2, 000 people were killed and scores of others injured .
in the wake of last week' s bomb blast in saigon ,
french officials report ...
i' m sorry to bother you , but ... would you mind to come downstairs with me ?
what do you want ?
i have something to show you .
it seems monsieur pyle came to see you the night he died .
so what , vigot ?
you said he did not .
by the way , we found pyle' s dog .
they cut its throat .
you see here ?
pyle' s dog had cement between its toes .
this was poured on the afternoon of his murder .
so what does that prove ?
and the patron of the vieux moulin told me that night you asked for a table for one .
not two .
i have nothing more to add to my original statement .
nothing ?
you know i didn' t kill him , vigot .
there' s a war on .
people are dying every day .
ask another girl .
i don' t want another girl .
will you come back now , phuong ?
will you come back to me ?
to london ?
no .
not to london .
then i don' t come back .
please .
i ...
i can' t take you to london .
because i' m not going .
i' m not leaving you .
never .
will you come back to me ?
will you take down my hair ?
yes .
do you miss him ?
yes .
i' m sorry .
why are you sorry ?
i don' t know .
i just feel that ...
i ought to apologise to ... someone .
not to me .
never to me .
they say you come to vietnam and understand a lot in a few minutes .
the rest has got to be lived .
they say whatever it was you were looking for you will find here .
they say there is a ghost in every house .
and if you can make peace with him , he will stay quiet . subtitle by turgay uykusuz
