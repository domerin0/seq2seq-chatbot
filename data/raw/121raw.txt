great job , gary .
thanks .
you too , steve .
that was the greatest acting i' ve ever seen .
i just don' t know how you do it , gary .
how do you make yourself so somber and emotional to make everybody cry like that ?
it' s not that hard , really .
i just think about the saddest moment in my life .
man , wow .
gary is such a great guy .
gary .
oh , no .
help me !
help me !
get off of me !
get this thing off of me !
gary !
hello , young man .
congratulations on a terrific performance .
oh , thank you .
i don' t believe we' ve met , mr ... ?
the name is spottswoode .
well , nice to meet you .
and you are gary johnston .
all american actor who graduated lowa university summa cum laude with a double major in theatre and world languages .
you' ve been at the top of every acting class since you were a child .
top gun actor .
hey , hold on a second , are you from hollywood ?
i have an incredible offer for you , gary .
if you' re interested , follow me this way .
please , gary , step into my car .
oh , i get it .
i' m supposed to get in your car and let you put your finger inside me .
then if i go down on you , i get a movie part .
no , i just want to show you something .
yeah , i' il bet you do .
please , gary ,
i' m not from hollywood .
i' m not going to fuck your mouth , and my time is extremely valuable .
jesus , this is a nice limo .
yes , it is .
now , suck my cock .
just kidding .
all right , just what the hell is this about ?
i hate to break this to you , gary , but some people out there want you dead .
dead ?
they' re called terrorists , gary .
and they hate everything about you .
why ?
what did i do to them ?
i' m just a broadway actor .
it' s not who you are , gary , it' s what you stand for .
and every single minute of every single day , the terrorists are planning new ways to kill you and everyone else who lives in a free country .
the only thing standing in their way is us .
you ?
baxter , i think we can " valmorphanize " safely now .
okay , a limousine that can fly .
now i have seen everything .
really ?
have you seen a man eat his own head ?
no .
so then you haven' t seen everything .
and neither have we .
last week in paris , we caught four terrorists with a weapon of mass destruction .
the terrorists are planning something very big .
and just what does this have to do with me ?
our only hope is to have somebody act like a terrorist who wants to help them carry out the attack .
an actor convincing enough to make the terrorists think he' s one of them .
this is crazy .
i' m an actor , not a spy .
acting .
and they say you' re the best .
an actor with a double major in theatre and world languages ?
hell , you' re the perfect weapon , gary .
look out !
right this way , you maverick renegade .
welcome to team base .
gary , this is joe , all star quarterback from the university of nebraska .
he' s a natural born leader .
i' ve heard a lot about your acting , mr. johnston .
hope it' s as good as they say it is .
and this is sarah , the top empath from berkeley' s school for the clairvoyant in san francisco .
i sense that you' re slightly confused right now .
that' s supposed to be carson' s replacement , a fucking actor ?
don' t mind chris .
he may be lacking courtesy , but he' s the best martial arts expert detroit has to offer .
that' s right , actor .
just stay the fuck away from me .
and finally , we have our psychology expert .
where' s lisa ?
right here .
gary , this is lisa .
she specializes in how the terrorists think .
usually a case of malignant narcissism brought on during childhood .
we' ve been doing our best to keep the world safe , gary .
but now somebody has supplied the terrorists with wmds .
and intelligence tells us they plan to use them .
isn' t that right , i. n. t. e. l. l. i. g. e. n. c. e. ?
that is affirmative .
i. n. t. e. l. l. i. g. e. n. c. e. ?
the most sophisticated computer in the world .
i' ve intercepted communications that several terrorist groups are being organized for one massive worldwide attack .
from what i. n. t. e. l. l. i. g. e. n. c. e. has gathered , it would be 9/ 11 times 100 .
9/ 11 times 100 ?
jesus , that' s ...
yes , 91, 100 .
basically , all the worst parts of the bible .
so now you see why we need you .
we will disguise you as a terrorist and take you deep into the middle east .
if your acting is successful , you' il be able to get us the information we need to stop this whole thing from happening .
of course , if you' re not interested ... ... there' s the door .
all right .
thanks .
gary .
hey , hold on a second .
don' t you understand ?
every country in the world is in danger .
how is it my responsibility to do something ?
because like it or not , you' re the one with the power to do something .
i can' t fight terrorists .
i don' t know anything about guns or jets .
that doesn' t matter .
if you wanna help people , all that matters , gary , is what you have here .
just think about it , okay ?
here , take this .
baxter will take you wherever you wanna go .
your freedom' s at stake too .
what do you think spottswoode sees in him ?
i don' t know .
but i think i see it too .
hey , baxter .
i wanna take a detour .
what would you do
if you were asked to give up your dreams for freedom ?
what would you do
if asked to make the ultimate sacrifice ?
would you think about all them people
who gave up everything they had ?
would you think about all them war vets
and would you start to feel bad ?
freedom isn' t free
it costs folks like you and me
and if we don' t all chip in
we' il never pay that bill
freedom isn' t free
no , there' s a hefty fucking fee
and if you don' t throw in your buck o' five , who will ?
buck o' five
freedom costs a buck o' five
our dear leader , kim jong il , says the weapons of mass destruction you requested are ready for you to take .
i am still in the process of recruiting and training new terrorists for the attack .
we take weapons later .
he asks what part of the deal you did not understand .
he says perhaps his translator did not make it clear to you .
he says he should fire his translator ?
do you have any idea how fucking busy i am ?
i cannot berieve that i have a chechnyan standing here terring me when he' s gonna take a derivery .
herro ?
perhaps we can be ready sooner .
yes , perhaps you can .
now , take your weapons of mass destruction and get the fuck out of here .
i had to come back .
i know you did , son .
i still say this is a fucking mistake .
stop it , chris .
i sense that you' re making him feel intimidated .
gary , i' m afraid there' s no time .
i. n. t. e. l. l. i. g. e. n. c. e. tells us the attack is imminent .
we need you to act like a middle eastern terrorist right away .
there' s just one problem .
i don' t look middle eastern .
leave that to us .
sarah' s a professional at skin grafting and laser " valmoriphication .
sarah' s a professional at skin grafting and laser " valmoriphication .
just try to be still .
amazing .
the valmoriphication completely worked .
sit up and take a look , gary .
it' s uncanny .
you' re going to fool everyone , gary .
or should i say ... ... hakmed .
all right , team , we' ve only got one shot at this , so listen up .
i. n. t. e. l. l. i. g. e. n. c. e. has intercepted communications that terrorists from different countries are gathering at a tavern here ,
in cairo .
cairo .
that' s in egypt .
exactly right , joe .
now , team , your mission will be to get gary into that tavern .
and once he' s on the inside , cover his back .
gary , you must use your acting to find out any information you can from the terrorists .
gary , if for some reason your cover is blown and the terrorists take you prisoner , well , you' il probably want to take your own life .
here , you' d better have this .
all right , team , that' s it .
we' ve got a job to do .
let' s go police the world .
america
america
america fuck , yeah
coming again to save the motherfucking day , yeah
america fuck , yeah
freedom is the only way , yeah
terrorists , your game is through
' cause now you have to answer to
america fuck , yeah
so lick my butt and suck on my balls
america fuck , yeah
what if the old man is wrong about him , huh ?
what if he' s not the great actor spottswoode says he is ?
why don' t you trust actors , chris ?
i got my reasons .
you all right , gary ?
i was just thinking .
on stage , if i mess up a line , it could mean a bad review .
if i mess up here , we' re all dead .
i believe you can do this , gary .
why ?
what reason do you have to believe ?
sometimes believing is all we have .
fear not , muslim friends .
we' re here to find terrorists .
i' m clearing your minds of all anxiety .
all right , good job , sarah .
now , everyone make for the tavern .
let' s get one thing straight , actor .
i don' t trust you .
if you betray us , i' il rip your fucking balls off and stuff them up your ass so that the next time you shit , you' il shit all over your balls , got it ?
what' s your problem with me ?
yeah , you wanna go ?
guys , guys , guys !
don' t you see this is just what the terrorists want us to do ?
the war is out there , man .

now , pull it together .
all right , team , let' s move to the inner city .
keep it quiet .

gary , you follow me .
the rest of the team , take super secret hiding positions alpha one .
all right , that' s the tavern with the blue door .
act your way past those guards and see what you can find out .

you remember the signal ?
that' s right .
all right , good luck .
go get them , cowboy .
oh , shit .
come on , gary , act .
you have the power .
all right , gary !
told you he was top gun .
i' ve never seen acting that good .
he' s amazing .
yeah , no , i know .
it' s terrible , terrible .
we are bashir rebels from the country of somalia .
who are you ?
my name is hakmed .
i' m a terrorist .
anybody know of any terrorist attacks coming up soon ?
i sense that i' m becoming attracted to gary .
my advice is not to get involved with a team member , sarah .
it' s too painful to see them die .
i' m sorry , lisa .
i didn' t mean to bring up ...
it' s okay , sarah .
i treasure your friendship .
i treasure yours , lisa .
hey , have you ever thought of telling sarah how you feel ?
what would a girl like sarah want with a simple nebraska boy like me ?
i don' t know nothing about fancy cars and fancy restaurants .
still , i' d love to show her a full moon night on the cornfields .
what do you know ?
i heard there might be a large terrorist attack .
if you tell me what it is , maybe i could help out .
get out of here .
we have put out a jihad on the infidels because they destroyed our lives .
what do you know about pain and sadness ?
gary .
help me !
help me !
get him off !
get this thing off of me !
gary !
i was just a boy when the infidels came to my village in their black hawk helicopters .
the infidels fired at the oil fields and they lit up like the eyes of allah .
burning oil rained down from the sky and cooked everything it touched .
i could only hide myself and cry as my goats were consumed by the fiery , black liquid death .
in the midst of the chaos ,
i could swear that i heard my goats screaming for help .
as quickly as they had come , the infidels were gone .
it was on that day i put a jihad on them .
and if you don' t believe it , then you better kill me now , because i' il put a jihad on you too .
i like you .
you have balls .
i like balls .
all right , listen carefully .
the wmds are located in a secret bunker 20 yards east of this building .
you can help us by guarding it and making ...
come .
they' re onto us !
hurry , friend .
we must make our escape .

gary found the wmds and the terrorists are down .
great job , team .
head back to base for debriefing and cocktails .
this is breaking news with peter jennings .
team america has once again pissed off the entire world after blowing up half of cairo .
and now some hollywood celebrities are lashing out .
alec baldwin is head of the film actors guild .
the film actors guild believes that what the world needs is compassion , not violence .
all that team america does is create new enemies .
let me explain to you how this works .
you see , the corporations finance team america .
and then team america goes out , and the corporations sit there in their ...
in their corporation buildings , and , see , they' re all corporation y , and they make money .
last year i went to iraq .
before team america showed up , it was a happy place .
they had flowery meadows and rainbow skies and rivers made of chocolate , where the children danced and laughed and played with gumdrop smiles .
the actors are calling for an emergency meeting .
already expected to attend are helen hunt ,
george clooney , liv tyler , martin sheen , susan sarandon ,
janeane garofalo and matt damon .
matt damon .
in the meantime , the world wants to deal with dangerous individuals their own way .
hans brix ?
oh , no .
oh , herro , great to see you again , hans .
mr. il , i was supposed to be allowed to inspect your palace today , and your guards won' t let me into certain areas .
hans , hans , hans .
we' ve been through this a dozen times .
i don' t have any weapons of mass destruction , okay , hans ?
then let me look around so i can ease the u. n. ' s collective mind .
hans , you' re breaking my barrs here .
hans , you' re breaking my barrs .
i' m sorry , but the u. n. must be firm with you .
let me see your whole palace or else .
or else what ?
or else we will be very , very angry with you .
and we will write you a letter telling you how angry we are .
okay , i' il show you , hans .
you ready ?
stand a rittle to your reft .
a rittle more .
good .
there you go , hans brix .
how you rike that , you fucking cocksucker ?
do you have any idea how fucking busy i am , hans brix ?
well , fuck you .
you want inspection ?
well , inspect that , you buttfucking piece of shit .
what , you think i' m just a petty arms dearer ?
i' m pranning the attack .
congraturations , team america , you have stopped nothing .
congratulations , gary .
you' ve done an amazing thing .
it will be years before the terrorists have the resources to attack again .
we' re gonna be unstoppable with you on the team , gary .
terrorists , your game is through .
you' re the best , gary .
so this terrorist is shooting at us from the back of his jeep , and he ...
you might have all the others fooled , but not me .
your acting was reckless and it put us all in danger .
the next time you pull a stunt like that , i' il drill two holes through your dick so that when you pee , it shoots out in all different directions .
you got it ?
hey , sarah , do you mind if i dance with you ?
no , of course not , joe .
joe , do you think it' s okay for team members to date ?
sarah , really ?
yeah .
do you think it' s all right ?
i think it' s better than all right .
it' s great !
oh , good .
i' m so glad you think so .
gary ?
you okay ?
i was just wondering if i can let go of an old , painful memory .
is it anything that you wanna talk about ?
when i was a kid , i always looked up to my older brother , tommy .
he was the jock , and i was the little performer .
we were all out at the zoo one day .
i was doing some acting , walking on the railing of the gorilla exhibit .
i fell in .
everyone screamed , and tommy jumped in after me , forgetting that he had blueberries in his front pocket .
the gorillas just went wild .
they jumped all over his body and threw him around like a rag doll to get to those blueberries .
one gorilla would throw him to another gorilla , who tossed him to another .
everyone panicked and cried out for somebody to help , but it was too late .
the gorillas beat him to death before the zookeepers could gas them all .
my acting ... ... got my brother killed .
i' ve had to live with that ... ... every single day .
gary , you can' t blame yourself for what gorillas did .
i think i can finally let it go .
because my acting saved the entire world .
and something even better happened .
what ?
i met somebody who took my breath away .
gary , no .
i' m sorry .
it' s just ...
things are really complicated , gary .
i know about carson .
i know how it feels .
god , i' m so confused .
it' s too soon to be having feelings for you .
maybe feelings are feelings because we can' t control them .
but i have to control them because i can' t go through losing somebody again .
it' s too painful .
so ...
so , what , you' re just gonna shut down ?
i really like you .
there' s no chance we can ever be together ?
only if you could promise me you' il never die .
you know i can' t promise that .
if you did that , i would make love to you right now .
i promise .
i will never die .
i need this , i need love i need you
i don' t need one heartbeat i need two
there' s an emptiness i need to fill
and only one emptiness will do
only a woman can brighten up my day
only a woman can touch me the right way , yeah
only a woman is allowed to touch me there
all i ask is that you' re a woman
all i ask is that you' re a woman
please just be a woman
lisa , you' re the most amazing person i' ve ever met .
it' s only been a short time , but i think that i' m completely in love ...
let' s not talk .
i can' t help it .
this just feels so right , and i don' t want anything to mess it up .
there' s not a thing in the world that can mess this up .
team , i' m afraid i have bad news .
at 7 : 15 this morning , the terrorists carried out their attack .
what ?
but how can that be ?
gary stopped the terrorists in cairo .
it appears now that i. n. t. e. l. l. i. g. e. n. c. e. was wrong about the chechnyans being in charge .
that was bad , i. n. t. e. l. l. i. g. e. n. c. e.
very bad i. n. t. e. l. l. i. g. e. n. c. e. i' m sorry .
we have to find out who did this and take them down .
fast .
sir , i am intercepting communications about the terrorists ' identities .
on screen .
this is breaking news with peter jennings .
an attack in panama today has left thousands dead .
taking credit were terrorists from derka derkastan .
of course , derka derkastan .
the terrorists claim that the attack was a retaliation for team america' s actions in cairo .
alec baldwin is rallying all the members of the film actors guild .
alec baldwin ?
gary ?
he' s my hero .
the single greatest actor of all time .
who is to blame for these attacks in panama ?
the terrorists ?
the person who supplied them with wmds ?
no .
blame team america .
their reckless disregard in cairo brought on this violence today .
team america , the blood of the victims of panama is on your hands .
moved by baldwin' s impassioned speech , hundreds of people turned out at mount rushmore today to protest .
hey , that' s here .
tom , it looks like filmmaker michael moore is also jumping on the " fuck team america " bandwagon .
protesting is not enough .
we must take radical action against the fascists in our own country .
bring it down !
bring it all down !
team , if the derka derkastanis have weapons of mass destruction ,
i' m afraid it could be 9/ 11 times 1, 000 .
jesus , you mean ... ?
yes .
nine hundred and eleven thousand .
then forget all these assholes .
we got work to do .
yes , let' s get gary valmorphanized so he can use his acting .
my acting ?
my acting ?
my acting just got a thousand people killed .
jesus , i' ve done it again .
pull yourself together , gary .
we need you now more than ever .
i' m through with this .
gary , you can' t go .
without you , the team is doomed .
remember , there is no " l " in team america .
yes , there is .
i know it' s hard , gary .
but you' re still the only hope to stop these newer terrorists .
why me ?
why am i the only one ?
because you' re the one with the power to ...
well , i don' t want the fucking power !
i don' t want the guilt , i don' t want the shame and i don' t want the responsibility .
then what about all the things you promised last night ?
you said you' d never leave .
i said i' d never die .
but now i' m dead inside .
you slept with gary ?
sarah .
but you knew i liked gary .
i told you .
you like gary ?
oh , i see .
i didn' t plan on it happening , sarah .
save it , lisa .
you see ?
all i do is hurt people .
gary , you didn' t kill your brother .
those gorillas did .
i' m sorry i' m not the man you think i am .
i' m just bad news .
i' il never act again .
fuck him .
we don' t need an actor .
we can take out the derka derkastanis the old fashioned way .
no .
it would be a suicide mission .
that' s all right .
i feel a little bit like dying .
goddamn it , gary .
america fuck , yeah
america fuck , yeah
coming again to save the motherfucking day , yeah
america fuck , yeah
freedom is the only way yeah
terrorists , your game is through

sarah , you know i didn' t mean to hurt you .
no , you just didn' t care if you did .
now , come on , sarah , that isn' t fair .
lisa can' t help it if gary has feelings for her .
just like nobody can help it if you have feelings for gary .
what is that supposed to mean ?
oh , come on , sarah .

joe has feelings for you ?

what would you do
if you were asked to give up your dreams for freedom ?
what would you do if asked to make the ultimate sacrifice ?
hey , weren' t you the actor in that broadway show ?
hey , yeah , it is you .
do that scene where everyone gets alds .
i don' t act anymore .
i gave that up .
oh , come on , man , just a scene .
i said , get away from me !
i' m completely lost .
i' ve hit rock bottom .
easy , easy .
you gotta calm down there , chuck .
i hurt people .
i' m a dick .
well , being a dick ain' t so bad .
dicks , pussies and assholes .
pussies think everyone can get along and dicks just wanna fuck all the time without thinking it through .
but then you got your assholes , chuck .
and all the assholes want is to shit all over everything .
so pussies may get mad at dicks once in a while because pussies get fucked by dicks .
but dicks also fuck assholes , chuck .
and if they didn' t fuck the assholes , you know what you' d get ?
you' d get your dick and your pussy all covered in shit .
all right , that does it .
get out of here , you drunk lowlife .
get out of here , i said .
lisa !
lisa .
lisa , are you here ?
get out of the street , you fucking bum !
you gave up on life , didn' t you ?
my fellow actors , we live in a dark time .
the world is becoming more and more violent and the idiots in charge are making it worse .
what the world needs is an international advisory committee who truly understands global politics .
namely , us .
the time has come for us to start using our acting talents in a different way .
yes , we can use our powers to change the world .
we will persuade everyone to drive hybrid cars and stop smoking .
if we focus our acting on global politics , we can change everything and stuff .
as actors , it is our responsibility to read the newspapers and then say what we read on television like it' s our own opinion .
matt damon .
we' ve all done action films .
if anyone tries to get in our way , we' il show them just how tough us actors really are .
i' m glad you all agree .
because i' ve just been contacted by a very important political leader who is bringing all the world leaders together for a massive international peace conference .
and he wants us to be the keynote speakers .
matt damon !
say hello to our new partner .
herro .
stop it !
stop it , you' re killing him !
i' m gonna fucking kill you !
you' re not in a position to kill anyone , my red , white and brue friend .
so you' re the bastard planning 9/ 11 times 1, 000 .
no .
you think so small .
you see , i' m about to have an eraborate peace ceremony .
and while all the world' s most important people are distracted here ,
i will detonate the wmds which i have given to terrorists arr around the grobe .
it will be 9/ 11 times 2, 356 .
my god , that' s ...
i don' t even know what that is .
nobody does .
you heartless bastard .
why would you do such a thing ?
because then there will be barance .
every country will be a third world country .
just imagine it .
all around the world , there will be massive exprosions .
with nobody to guide them , the people will break out into panic and rioting all over the earth .
the true nature of humanity is unreashed .
dog eats dog , as everyone attacks everyone and fends only for themselves .
grobal stabirity unravels .
by the time my show is over , it will be far too rate .
your plan will fail .
you' il never keep the world leaders distracted here for nine hours .
oh , no ?
i' ve got arec barrwin .
dear god .
you are the rast of a dying breed , the frag waving american .
well , your rittle dream will soon be over .
i must get back to pranning the ceremony now .
the film actors are on their way .
perhaps they' il stop in and say herro .
having so little faith in humanity must make you a very lonely man .
you shall have a front row seat .
bring her upstairs .
leave her alone , you son of a bitch !
lisa , i treasure your friendship !
somebody has to stop this !
i miss you more than michael bay missed the mark
when he made pearl harbor
i miss you more than that movie missed the point
and that' s an awful lot , girl and now
now you' ve gone away
and all i' m trying to say
is pearl harbor sucked
and i miss you
i need you like ben affleck needs acting school
he was terrible in that film
i need you like cuba gooding needed a bigger part
he' s way better than ben affleck and now
all i can think about is your smile
and that shitty movie too
pearl harbor sucked
and i miss you
pearl harbor sucked
just a little bit more than i miss you
oh , my god .
what the hell happened ?
hello ?
anybody ?
greetings , mr. johnston .
i. n. t. e. l. l. i. g. e. n. c. e. , what the hell happened ?
our base was attacked by a giant socialist weasel .
but where' s the team ?
they have been taken prisoner by kim jong ii in north korea .
i have intercepted communications that he is planning the massive attack during a peace ceremony .
don' t move , protester , or i' il blow your commie brains out .
spottswoode .
johnston ?
what the hell are you doing here ?
get away from i. n. t. e. l. l. i. g. e. n. c. e.
i' m using it to blow up north korea .
no !
the team is in north korea .
i know .
and so are the triggers to wmds poised all around the globe .
my only option now is to blow up kim jong ii and everything around him before he can set them off .
i. n. t. e. l. l. i. g. e. n. c. e. , initiate detonation sequence on the ships .
you' il kill them all .
it' s what they would want me to do , gary .
they would happily give their lives for the good of the world ,
something you don' t understand !
there has to be another way .
there' s nobody left to stop kim jong il .
let me go .
you ?
you' re a buttfucking quitter .
you walked out , gary .
the team went on a mission without you .
and without an actor , they were like pigs to the slaughter .
i' m supposed to leave the fate of the world in your hands ?
i know i walked out , but i' d do anything to take it back .
please , just let me help .
you' ve done enough .
please , spottswoode , you have to believe in me .
i want to believe in you , gary , i really do .
but you' ve let me down before .
please , how can i make you trust me ?
i remember the first time we met .
you were a simple broadway actor afraid to get in my limo because you thought i wanted you to perform oral sex on me .
do you remember that ?
yeah .
and now the tables are turned , and i don' t know if i can trust you .
just give me a chance .
all right , i' il trust you .
but only if you ... ... will perform oral sex on me .
what ?
right here , right now .
you can' t be serious .
oh , i am serious .
look , this is my serious face .
what will that prove ?
it will prove that you are truly ready to lay everything on the line .
to throw away all your inhibitions and give 100 percent .
we must go back to that first night we met , that first issue of trust .
don' t you see ?
no .
i thought you weren' t gay .
this isn' t about sex , gary , it' s about trust .
it' s the eye of the needle , gary , and we must both pass through it .
okay , let' s do it .
i' il make sure nobody' s watching .
yeah , it looks clear .
okay , go .
there must be another way .
i guess you won' t do everything to take it all back , will you , gary ?
no , no , no .
wait , wait , hold on .
you' re saying if i do that , you' il let me help the team ?
i' il give you all the time i can .
okay , let' s do it .
here we go .
and go .
you are dedicated .
now , let' s go get cleaned up .
if you' re going to storm kim jong ll' s palace single handed , we have to make you a complete soldier in very little time .
how we gonna do that ?
i think i know just what we need .
the hour' s approaching to give it your best
and you' ve got to reach your prime
that' s when you need to put yourself to the test
and show us a passage of time
we' re gonna need a montage montage
it takes a montage montage
show a lot of things happening at once
remind everyone of what' s going on
and with every shot show a little improvement
to show it all would take too long
that' s called a montage montage
girl , we want a montage montage
in anything , if you want to go
from just a beginner to a pro
you need a montage montage
even rocky had a montage montage
always fade out in a montage montage
if you fade out it seems like more time has passed
in a montage montage

the others tied me up because i wouldn' t go along with their plans .
your skills are fading with age , miss sarandon .
you shall die a peasant' s death !
jesus titty fucking christ .
i could' ve sworn she was telling the truth .
that' s why they call it acting .
come on , we gotta find lisa .
i was 19 years old when the musical cats came to our town .
i couldn' t wait to see it .
after the show , i was asked if i wanted to go meet some of the performers backstage .
man , i was thrilled .
but when i got back there , they were drunk and out of control .
rumpus cat and macavity kept feeling up my leg .
i tried to leave , but rumpleteazer held me down and ... ... i was raped by mr. mistoffelees .
that' s why you don' t trust actors .
i' m sorry i' ve been so hard on you .
if there' s still a world left when this is all over ,
i' d like to buy you a beer .
come on , let' s go .
we' re running out of time .
sarah , before we die , i want to finally tell you that i love you .
no .
no , i' m not gonna let it end like this .
we are not your enemy , furry ones .
you will not attack us .
sarah , that isn' t going to work .
you don' t really have mental powers .
your captors are behind you , shebas .
show your anger to them .
sarah , you did it !
wait .
hold on .
spottswoode , i think we just found the entrance to the theatre .
have sarah and joe lock on to our ...
gary !
actors , ho !
helen hunt .
samuel jackson .
matt damon .
motherfucker .
gary , chris , come in .
and now , radies and gentlemen , mr. arec barrwin .
we are here to usher in a new era without violence .
by following the rules of the film actors guild , the world can become a better place that handles dangerous people with talk and reasoning .
that is the f. a. g. way .
one day you' il all look at the world us actors created and say ,
wow .
good going , f. a. g.
you really made the world a better place , didn' t you , f. a. g. ?
yes , arec barrwin .
too bad there won' t be a world reft .
oh , god , no .
you see ?
no prince charming rode in on a white stallion to save the day .
this is the real world .
i' m afraid your world is over .
in five minutes .
yes , the ticking crock .
sorry , team america , but you see , we must live in a time of peace .
put down the gas can now .
kill them .
jackson !
team , you' ve got to hurry .
let' s go , bitch .
i' ve done action films .
come on .
matt damon !
come on , stop trying to hit me and hit me .
don' t fucking move !
now , isn' t that a shame .
you came so close to stopping peace .
but you see , peace always finds a way .
goodbye , team america .
i' ve just got one piece of bad news for you , robbins .
what' s that ?
i' m a smoker .
now that the world is going to be run peacefully , we should all drive hybrid cars .
right now famiries are gathering in parks , children are walking to school , friends are sitting in movie theatres .
all compretery unaware that the world is about to change forever .
all because of me .
stop that man .
gary !
team america ?
goddamn it .
sorry to interrupt the show , everyone , but kim jong ii is an international criminal .
we' re here to arrest him .
oh , no , you' re not .
this is a peace conference .
and if you even try to touch kim jong il , this audience and i will rise up against you .
fuck off , team america !
team , there' s no time .
you have to convince that audience to let you do your job .
gary , you' ve got to take the stage .
no .
i can' t upstage alec baldwin .
he' s the best actor in the world .
you have to try .
i' m not that good .
actually ... ... you' re the finest actor i' ve ever met .
come on , gary , hurry .
you' ve got to act fast .
i know you all don' t like team america a whole lot right now , but kim jong ii is a lot worse .
you can' t outact me , boy .
don' t even try .
for the truth is that team america fights for the billion dollar corporations .
they are just as bad as the enemies they fight .
oh , no , we aren' t .
we' re dicks !
we' re reckless , arrogant , stupid dicks .
and the film actors guild are pussies .
and kim jong ii is an asshole .
pussies don' t like dicks , because pussies get fucked by dicks .
but dicks also fuck assholes , assholes who just wanna shit on everything .
pussies may think they can deal with assholes their way .
but the only thing that can fuck an asshole is a dick with some balls .
the problem with dicks is that sometimes they fuck too much .
or fuck when it isn' t appropriate .
yes , gary , yes .
and it takes a pussy to show them that .
but sometimes pussies get so full of shit that they become assholes themselves .
because pussies are only an inch and a half away from assholes .
i don' t know much in this crazy , crazy world ... ... but i do know that if you don' t let us fuck this asshole ... ... we are gonna have our dicks and our pussies ... ... all covered in shit .
show us what you' re doing , kim jong il .
do something , arec barrwin !
the ...
global warming and ...
corporate america ...
you are worthress , arec barrwin .
don' t fucking move !
you were all going to be treated to a faburous show .
but now party' s over .
for i am the great kim jong il .
lisa .
and i am the greatest terrorist ever to have rived .
terrorize this .
lisa , are you okay ?
no , gary , the countdown .
you have to stop it .
what do i do ?
hit the big " cancel " button !
gary , how did you manage this ?
spottswoode helped me .
spottswoode ?
he' s alive ?
lisa , i' m crazy about you .
will you please forgive me if i ... ?
you had me at " dicks fuck assholes .
attention .
attention , everyone .
all you in the audience should go to your homes now .
your countries need you .
but the world will be safe , thanks to a brilliant actor named gary johnston .
let me explain to you the kind of man gary is .
he' s a man who knows that when you put another man' s cock in your mouth , you make a pact .
a bond that cannot be broken .
he' s a man so dedicated that he will get down on his knees and put that cock right in his mouth .
wait a minute .
look !
you have not heard the rast of kim jong il .
i will return !
you shall see .
i will be back !
so rong , earthrings !
we' il be here waiting for you , kim jong il .
