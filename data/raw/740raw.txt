goodbye , sweetheart !
t ake good care of yourself .
oh , mummy , you forgot this .
angel !
i worry so about you living alone .
oh , mother , it' s adorable of you to be so concerned , but i' m perfectly capable of taking care of myself , dear .
come on , girls .
goodbye , my chicken .
yes , i' m free !
i can live in new york on my own .
i can do whatever i want !
yay !
yes !
i was born and nurtured in new york , the center of the universe .
unfortunately , my mother is moving me to another planet .
new jersey .
is it any wonder that i couldn' t face reality ?
can anyone blame me for dreaming that she was leaving me behind in my beloved city ?
mary !
mary , let' s go !
goodbye , childhood home .
goodbye , intellectual and spiritual stimulation .
goodbye , broadway .
mary , please .
don' t be such a drama queen .
lola !
my name from this day forward is lola .
i' ve known since i was 5 years old that my true name is lola .
you were named mary .
it is the name on your birth certificate .
it is the name that i am going to call you .
in my family , i am a flamingo in a flock of pigeons .
goodbye , new york .
goodbye , any chance of becoming a famous actress .
your parents tell you to have hopes and dreams .
and then they move you to new jersey .
it makes no sense .
welcome to deadwood .
is she allowed to say that ?
come on .
hurry , hurry .
let' s see the new house .
come on .
oh , mom .
it' s just grass .
but it' s all over the place .
the sun porch is my bedroom .
ordinariness isn' t the only thing
i have to fight against in my house .
gross injustice is another .
the only person i can turn to is stu wolff , the greatest poet since shakespeare and the lead singer of sidarthur .
he' d see me through my dark suburban days .
in the city , i took two subways and a bus to get to school .
it amazes me that i can get to school without it costing $1 . 50 .
dellwood high .
i shall be a bird in a cage with a good school district .
however , there is absolutely no point in being negative about things you just can' t change .
i look upon my new town as an empty stage to which i' m allowed to bring my own script .
in my heart , i feel that a legend is about to be born .
that legend would be me .
hello .
hey .
i' m lola steppe .
i' m from new york , originally .
ella gerard .
i' m from right here , originally .
well , hi .
hi .
hi !
hi .
have you ever seen sidarthur in person ?
no , but i think stu wolff is the greatest poet since shakespeare .
i do , too .
i have every cd they ever made .
you do ?
yeah !
and that' s stu wolff dancing .
i' ve downloaded some great shots of him .
here he is at the grammys .
this is where he lives .
this is the dress that i' m gonna wear when we get married .
this is him getting into his limo .
that black spot right there is his head .
what a wonderful black spot it is .
hi .
carla santini .
sidarthur .
my father is stu wolff' s lawyer .
really ?
your dad must have been in the same room as him and everything .
many times .
aren' t you the girl who just moved into the swenska house ?
well , i' m lola steppe .
i didn' t know our home had a name .
is that supposed to be that famous new york sense of humor ?
new yorkers learn to laugh at themselves and everything else when they' re very young .
my parents took me to new york for my birthday .
i thought it was beautiful .
the lights and everything .
i know why they call it the greatest city in the world .
ella gerard , you are the sister of my soul !
you should see park avenue at christmas .
it' s like walking through the milky way .
except nobody gets mugged in the milky way .
we' il take our seats now .
miss baggoli ?
yes ?
we have a new girl from new york city .
we do .
miss steppe .
miss steppe .
miss baggoli , i know it must show on your records that my name is mary , but everyone has referred to me as lola since i was a squealing infant in my mother' s arms .
i don' t even know who this mary is .
i like that name .
lola .
lola .
this is lola .
lola , you should know that you' re sitting in my favorite seat in history class .
i like to be dead center .
me too , and i didn' t think we had anything in common .
i' ve earned the center seat .
besides , if you want to fit in , you probably shouldn' t draw attention to yourself .
in case you haven' t noticed , i like the attention .
chill .
also , i wouldn' t hang out with ella " never had a fella .
she doesn' t really have your potential , now , does she ?
look at her .
she dresses like a politician' s wife with the hair and the shoes .
she' s so random .
and what about those glasses ?
they are so 10 minutes ago .
but i' m gonna stop myself before i get nasty .
i want to let you know that if you' re careful , you could be chilling with us .
chilling with you is what i' ve always dreamed of .
hey , ella , wait up !
do you mind if i sit with you ?
oh , no , that' s fine .
this is great .
when you eat outside in new york , your food gets dirty .
so what' s with the great santini ?
she' s beautiful .
she' s popular .
she' s rich .
in kindergarten , she used to bite the heads off dolls .
ew .
who' s that guy smiling at us ?
that' s sam .
sam !
sam , lola .
lola , sam .
hi .
hey .
it' s your first day here , right ?
yeah .
well , it' s good to meet you .
you too .
i' il see you later .
i couldn' t possibly have a boyfriend .
i mean , i have to focus on my acting career .
after three weeks ,
i' m getting used to the rich part of town .
gated , dull , armani ridden .
you know , i' m the kind of riffraff they try to keep out .
when stu wolff sings ,
there' s something in me that always wants more .
more moons and stars and music in the wind , " it' s as though he' s just talking to me .
i like steve .
i bet stu is hard to get along with .
you can tell he' s sort of moody .
haunted .
all true geniuses are haunted .
it' s part of what they have to suffer for their art .
popovers , ladies .
wow .
this is just like eating in a diner .
thank you .
well , surely you have popovers at home .
i just popped them in the microwave .
my mother doesn' t approve of microwaves .
she has very strong opinions .
i' ve never heard of anyone taking a stance on an appliance before .
why doesn' t your mother like me ?
she likes you .
she just thinks you' re a little strange .
i mean , you are , a little .
lola !
lola , i' m sorry !
it' s really your mother she thinks is strange .
my mom saw your mother in the supermarket wearing dirty overalls with chopsticks in her hair and arguing with the butcher .
it' s not important .
not important ?
she' s the woman who gave me life .
whose milk fed my fragile body .
whose blood flows through my veins .
of course it' s important .
my parents are square .
neither of them is too happy about the fact that your mother has three children and no husband .
single motherhood is a transitory state .
karen used to be married .
it could happen again .
but i thought you said you were a love child .
well , i was a love child .
mom and dad were married and passionately in love .
my parents were mad for each other as soon as their eyes met .
dad was like a rock star .
mom was a babe .
the rest was destiny .
they got married .
and then they camped in the desert and counted the stars .
one million and three .
one million and four .
jeez .
my parents went on a cruise to bermuda , but they were afraid to get off the boat .
mine were in love .
deeply , movingly .
the only thing that could have made their lives better was having me .
even as an infant
i aspired to have a relationship just like theirs .
and then the twins were conceived , and we couldn' t have been more thrilled .
upon hearing the news , my father mounted his really cool motorcycle to buy the mother of his child and future children her favorite flowers .
suddenly ...
aah !
they found him strewn across 9th avenue .
and 10th .
lola , i' m so sorry .
i had no idea .
ironic , isn' t it ?
your parents think my mother is the destroyer of our social order .
she' s merely a victim of fate .
what ?
nothing .
i like the chopsticks in your hair .
because carla santini thinks she' s julia roberts and the universe is interested in everything she says , you can' t help overhearing her .
so i had this really long talk with miss baggoli yesterday about the drama club' s production of " pygmalion .
i told her i think it' s really rigid to stick to the original .
not stick to the original ?
not stick to the exquisite words of mr. george bernard shaw ?
we' re not english , and this isn' t the 19th century , so i think we should adapt the classics to reflect our times .
they' re classics because they' re classic .
then i told her about my idea to move the location to present day new york and make eliza a checkout girl .
you' re gonna be playing eliza ?
well , of course .
i' ve already got the part .
when i moved to deadwood ,
i really felt that a legend was about to be born .
was carla santini going to stand in the way of that birth ?
miss baggoli , miss baggoli !
i didn' t know " pygmalion " had already been cast .
i would have loved to be eliza doolittle .
maybe if i could just prove it to you now .
oh , no , no , lola .
i just put the notice up on the board .
auditions are not until friday .
thank you , miss baggoli .
george bernard shaw is a great playwright .
and he' s also a vegetarian .
you' re just in time , lola .
quickly .
i' m telling all the others about this idea that i have had for our production of " pygmalion .
now , as you know , " pygmalion " is a play which takes place in old timey london .
my idea is that we will set our production of " pygmalion " in modern day new york .
and eliza will be a checkout girl at a supermarket ,
and professor higgins will be a professor at nyu .
that is such a brilliant idea .
that' s gonna give the play new resonance and immediacy for today .
you mean it was your idea ?
yes , lola , it' s my idea .
i know i' m just a teacher , but i am capable of thought .
now , since we' re going hip and modern ,
i have also added contemporary songs .
and i am calling it " eliza rocks " !
now , each of you will be singing a song for me of your choice , and then you' il be reading a scene for me .
but i haven' t rehearsed a song or anything .
i' m simply not prepared .
that' s fine .
you can just wing it .
but acting is my chosen career .
i mean , i intend to be in theater .
i don' t want anyone remembering a substandard audition .
then how are we to proceed ?
i guess i' il try , of course .
perhaps you could try now .
you could go first .
okay .
take a spot on the stage .
anywhere you' re comfortable .
maybe if we' re lucky , she' il fall .
i' d like to sing a song by my favorite band ,
sidarthur .
self doubt didn' t kick in until the morning when i woke up with a heart as cold and heavy as mt .
everest .
it was the day the cast list went up .
why had i been so certain i was going to get the lead ?
miss baggoli didn' t say anything encouraging .
carla smiled .
well , look what the wind blew in .
look what the cat dragged in .
ladies .
after you .
right .
after me .
unh !
ow .
well , once again , i got the part that i wanted .
oh !
oh !
there are no small parts , only small actors .
you can quote me .
i' m your new eliza !
aah !
amazing !
i didn' t think i' d get it , but i did .
i didn' t think that , because i knew you' d get it .
no , ' cause i was ...
actually , my part , the one of mrs. higgins , is much more interesting than eliza' s in many ways .
i mean , even though she' s not the female lead , it' s a part with depth and true contemporary resonance .
it' s the one that i wanted .
good , ' cause that' s the one you got .
i' il show you what it' s like to be in my school .
is that a threat ?
absolutely .
to " eliza rocks " !
to " eliza rocks " !
oh , man .
congratulations .
this is the best day .
i can' t imagine that carla got beat out !
hey , sidarthur fans , how about some big news ?
you heard it here first .
the band is breaking up .
what ?
yep , sidarthur is no more .
i repeat , no more .
stu wolff is moving on and saying ,
never , never , will i work with them again .
so , in memory of the band ,
iet' s hear a track from " always morning .
no !
it can' t be !
it just can' t be !
aah !
aah !
aah !
what ?
what' s the matter ?
i can' t breathe .
mom , i can' t breathe .
i heard .
thanks for being here at a time like this .
i don' t want to believe it .
i made these flyers to hand out to fans urging them to protest .
as these balloons go to the heavens , so do the stars of our sidarthur mix among the stars of our universe .
symbolically , of course .
can you believe this ?
one of the most catastrophic events in the history of the universe has occurred , and everyone' s acting as if nothing has happened .
great .
me again , of course .
so , who' s next ?
me .
are you crazy ?
carla' s the all time champion .
so ?
there' s gonna be a new all time champion .
i think you' ve peaked .
hop on .
round one .
my father , who , as you know , is the lawyer for sidarthur , just called me to tell me what he found out about the band .
oh , really ?
what he told me isn' t available to the public yet .
sidarthur' s having a farewell concert in new york next month .
daddy already has v. i. p. seats , but that' s not the best part .
i didn' t think it would be .
there' s gonna be a party afterwards at stu' s loft for all of sidarthur' s closest friends .
so i' ve heard .
and guess who already has an invitation ?
it just so happens that ella and i do .
oh , really ?
yeah , really .
how' d you manage that ?
same way you did .
through parental connections .
what connections do you have other than the phone ?
winner .
me again .
loser .
game' s not over yet .
round two .
actually , my mother has the connections .
marsh warner bought a piece from her last summer .
and marshie , as i call him , is their manager .
i know who he is .
he remembered i was crazy about sidarthur , so he got us invited .
wow , your mom must be some potter .
winner .
me , lola steppe .
remember that name .
loser .
awesome !
why did you tell carla that we were invited to his party ?
you would have done the exact same thing if you were me .
i wouldn' t have lied .
i would have thought before i spoke .
i can' t even imagine being you .
carla santini drives me insane .
don' t even say that .
two of her nannies were institutionalized .
not to worry .
you just handed her exactly what she needs to ridicule you and humiliate you for the rest of your life , and me , too !
i guess it depends , doesn' t it ?
depends on what ?
well , on whether we go .
to the concert ?
in new york ?
and the party .
we haven' t exactly been invited .
you don' t have to be invited to a party like that .
there are people in new york that don' t go out unless it' s to crash a celebrity bash .
my mother would never let me go .
we can work around your mother , ella .
tell the truth .
are you partially insane ?
you know , we have to go .
it' s a matter of pride .
is there something wrong with the salmon ?
no , just not very hungry .
in too much pain .
i' m in pain , too .
my tooth' s coming out .
oh !
it' s not that kind of pain .
it' s pain of the heart .
sidarthur' s broken up .
they' re having one last concert in new york .
that' s it .
they' re done .
good night , sweet princes .
may choirs of rock angels sing you to sleep .
i have no reason to live without them .
let me take a wild guess .
you want to go to the concert .
if i could just see them play live .
i' d have the memory to carry me through the long , empty years that lie ahead , like a road in kansas .
okay , i don' t think that kids and rock concerts are a great mix .
how can you treat me like this ?
i was your firstborn .
you leaned over my crib to make sure i was breathing .
that' s why i want to keep you alive .
she wouldn' t even stop for the tiniest , most subatomic second to consider my fragile hopes and dreams .
what did ella' s mother say ?
she didn' t ask her .
she said her mom would bite off a $10 acrylic nail if she even brought it up .
so i guess that' s that .
no , i' m not exactly a " que ser , ser " kind of person .
right .
i like your necklace .
thanks .
i' ve had it since i was 6 .
it' s practically an antique .
i like your boots .
thanks .
i like your smile .
om .
om .
dinner , mary , now .
i' m on a hunger strike , like gandhi , driven to desperate measures by the insensitivity of the british government .
not one morsel will pass my lips until you say i can go see sidarthur .
you have got two minutes to get to this table or the insensitive british government is gonna take the door off its hinges and drag you out here .
hello ?
om .
come in if you must .
yeah .
the thing is , the drama queen has been gandhi for two days .
i' il take her .
okay , i will try it .
your dad wants to know if he can take you to the concert .
hi , dad .
thanks for the invitation , but i couldn' t go with my father .
i' d die of shame .
okay .
all right .
love you .
love you , too .
bye .
hello ?
yeah .
mm hmm .
okay .
om .
i' il try it .
okay , how about this ?
daddy drops you off at the concert and picks you up after .
you mean like a little kid being picked up from day care ?
is there no end to the humiliation you want to heap upon me , mom ?
we' re heaping humiliation .
yeah .
okay .
bye .
all right , tonight you are eating .
is mary going to die ?
she' s not gonna die .
but it smells like something has died in here .
what is that smell ?
okay .
that' s it .
no allowance for one month , and then you' re gonna have a parole hearing .
but i could really use the money now , mom .
can' t you take it away next month or september ?
no .
it' s so cool .
i have been looking all over for you two .
i knew you' d want to see these .
see , they just came in the mail .
they' ve just been printed .
please , you' re blocking my view .
so , did you get yours yet ?
actually , mine came in the mail yesterday , but i' m nice enough not to flaunt them .
why don' t you admit you don' t have tickets or an invite and get it over with ?
i' m sure there' s gonna be a lot of photographers there .
maybe we can even get our pictures taken together .
that' s a deal .
and you can be in the shot , too , ella .
absolutely .
i' il be there .
really ?
i guess .
i have enough for both of us .
i' m gonna pay you back the second i get my allowance reinstated .
as soon as i get my first starring role ,
i' m taking you to europe .
you sure we have enough ?
oh , no .
company .
wow , look who' s here .
i' d stay and chat , but i don' t want to stay and chat .
she was so mean to callie stevens , and her family had to move to cleveland .
catch you at the concert friday .
that would be a good line if we were going .
i don' t think something as small as tickets should stop us .
scalpers , ella .
part of the fun in going to new york is dealing with the slimeball scalpers .
if we go , i just know something is gonna go wrong .
i' m gonna die , and my parents are gonna find out .
and then mrs. higgins says ,
and what will you do now , dear ?
hi .
hey , mom .
there' s gonna be a cast party at carla " the bad " santini' s house after the show .
everyone' s gonna be really dressed up .
it' s my big night .
i want to look absolutely perfect .
well , the car broke down today .
that cost me $600 .
plus i have to buy a new kiln .
so , do you think you could look absolutely perfect in something that you already own ?
sure , i' il try and find something .
yeah .
can you believe 64 hours from now we' il be within touching distance from the man who wrote so many great songs , and i still haven' t found something to wear ?
what i needed for the concert was a drop dead gorgeous dress that made me look 25 and sophisticated enough to have a perfume named after me .
this had to be really , really special .
it had to be glamorous , and it had to make a statement .
if i wanted stu wolff to notice me , that is .
might as well just wear this to see stu .
nothing else to wear anyway .
i' m gonna be the dowdy redhead who doesn' t know how to dress .
don' t worry , ella , i' il find something to wear .
i mean , accessories are good , too .
they' il help me .
don' t cry .
i can' t lie !
i can' t say i' m sleeping over at your house when i' m not .
i can' t go into new york behind my parents ' backs .
i can' t do it .
we' re not really going behind their backs .
they' re gonna be in the city , just not in the same venue .
i' m not going .
i' m not going .
i' m not going .
we' re supposed to do things like this .
15 year olds in other cultures are grandmothers .
no one gave them permission to do that .
it' s not our fault that the people who brought us into this world don' t understand that we must fly away from the nest .
nature is telling us to go .
and our parents are good people .
they love us .
yeah , they love us , right ?
they really love us .
i' m sure they' d hate if anything happened to us .
wait here one second , okay ?
don' t cry .
it' s gonna work out .
we' il go , and it' il be fun .
i can' t lie !
mom , it' s amazing how sometimes i come to your conclusions .
ella and i could use , as you say , adult supervision .
uh huh .
so here' s the plan .
you drive us to the train in broad , broad daylight .
ella' s parents are going to be in new york .
they' d be happy to pick us up at grand central station .
they' il drop us off at the concert .
we' il stay overnight at their hotel .
sounds so safe , i know .
i can' t believe it came out of my head .
okay , i' m gonna have to talk with ella' s mom and dad .
of course , and when you do it , do it gently .
they know nothing about this .
mary !
and try and remember , we' re in suburbia .
yeah , yeah , i know .
it wouldn' t hurt if you threw in that microwaves aren' t that bad .
well , see , mary feels she really must see the concert .
is that how you feel , sweetie ?
you must see these sidarthur people ?
it' s their last performance .
well , why didn' t you just ask , pumpkin ?
i didn' t know i could .
all right , your mother and i are going into the city on thursday for a long weekend .
we' il pick them up .
they can stay with us at the hilton .
which is down the street from the concert .
well , that would be great .
oh , it' s as if the heavens wanted this .
miss baggoli , someone broke the heel .
no !
oh !
girls .
everybody .
listen up .
general announcement , everyone .
costumes are sacred .
costumes are sacred .
please .
i mean , what does one wear to stu wolff' s party ?
there' s gonna be so many famous people there .
i don' t know .
i just want to look hot .
one wears what one usually wears to these soirees .
oh !
lola !
lola , please !
lola !
lola !
oh , my gosh !
lola !
crime has never appealed to me as a way of life .
but a girl' s gotta do what a girl' s gotta do .
i needed eliza' s dress .
you don' t have to do this for me .
i know you said you' d do me a favor .
but this one may be too big .
don' t worry .
i' il be in and out of the drama room in seconds .
5 , 6 , 7 , 8 .
i know it' s not like me to be unprofessional , but how can i concentrate when sam is risking his life for me ?
when in 10 hours ' time i' il be standing in front of stu wolff ?
oof .
wait a minute .
no , no .
okay , everybody , that' s enough !
excuse me , please !
i' m sorry .
maybe you' re messing up so much because you' re so excited about the concert tonight .
no , i' m used to those things .
lola and carla , do you have to talk ?
opening night is in one week .
i would think that we could just have one decent rehearsal by now !
all right .
what i think we' il do now is we' il just breathe .
breathe deep , and try and relax .
and another one .
shake it , shake it , shake it , shake it , shake it .
and you all just keep shaking and relaxing .
i' m gonna get something i need out of the drama room .
no , miss baggoli .
i' il get it for you .
that' s all right , lola .
what i need is locked up in the drama room .
but on page 42 of the script is where i want to look down demurely .
lola , get out of my way !
can' t we just go back onto the stage ?
miss baggoli , please .
please , just get out of
lola , would you please get out of my way ?
that' s odd .
why isn' t this locked ?
oh , my goodness .
hmm .
but i always lock this door .
you probably did lock it .
we have the same lock at home .
sometimes it works .
sometimes it doesn' t .
you never know what' s gonna happen .
oh , oh .
okay , nothing seems to be missing .
why would anything be missing here ?
well , i have no idea , do l ?
you know , i just want to talk to you about my lines .
i don' t know them that well .
you don' t know your lines ?
at this time , i don' t even want to discuss this .
no , i' m not even gonna discuss this right now .
lola , you' re just making me so nervous .
well , i need to show you something on the stage .
you know what i think ?
i think that you' ve just been working so hard , entirely too hard , and that you should just really try and take the weekend off and relax , okay ?
i' ve never really relaxed before .
there' s no reason i can' t try .
i think you should .
i just think you should .
oh , my gosh .
i was so terrified .
i know .
i was about to grab the dress when miss baggoli came in .
thanks for trying .
trying ?
take a look under the hood .
are you kidding me ?
hurry , i don' t want to miss the train .
wait for me !
i don' t believe it .
i don' t believe you stole eliza' s dress .
i didn' t steal it .
i borrowed it .
borrowed ?
you mean you asked if it was okay ?
well , not exactly .
i mean , sam
you got sam to steal it for you ?
borrowed it .
sam borrowed it .
it' il be back by monday morning .
oh .
yeah .
i' m getting off .
i can' t go through with this .
ella , don' t back out now .
please just let me have one night of pure joy if i' m gonna have to spend the rest of my youth behind bars .
this better be one great concert .
that' s a given .
i don' t want to get near a scalper .
you take the money , okay ?
okay .
wow , you look beautiful .
you too , lola .
thanks .
yes , you do .
both of you .
now , the hotel is just a few blocks from the theater .
i know .
i know my new york .
we' il be back in the hotel room at 12 : 00 .
you have your tickets and your money ?
we have the money .
we' il buy the tickets .
oh , here .
thank you .
we' il drop you off .
i can assure you , everything is gonna be fine .
it' s just a quiet little concert .
okay , ella , heads up .
march forward .
get ready to rock ' n ' roll .
girls , please .
our tickets are at the door .
okay .
look for someone who' s selling tickets .
isn' t there a stall or something ?
no .
they' re just ordinary people doing ordinary scalping .
watch this .
you have to be strict with these people .
you have to bargain and deal .
how much ? $165 in orchestra .
can' t get any better than that .
we' il take them . $165 doesn' t leave us very much for incidentals .
when you get to see stu wolff , you don' t need incidentals .
it' s in your makeup bag .
oh , right .
what' s wrong ?
ella , it' s not here .
my makeup bag' s not here .
it must be .
it has to be .
when did you last see it ?
in the train .
i left it behind the sink .
oh , no .
oh .
maybe it' s karma .
all we have to do is go in with a large group of people .
what ?
you mean sneak in ?
sneaking would be beneath us , but i can' t think of a better word for what we' re about to do .
i have never snuck ever .
i can' t do it .
i' m terrified just being here .
stage fright .
it' il pass .
this is a little tricky , so just follow my lead , okay ?
i wonder what song they' il do .
i hope they do " love loser .
oh , i' m so excited !
i feel like i' ve been waiting for this forever .
just a minute .
can i have another look at your ticket , please ?
right .
my ticket .
sure .
you know , it' s not here .
i must have dropped it or something .
no ticket , no concert .
i demand to see your supervisor .
yeah ?
you can see him outside .
come to the door .
come to the door .
okay , go see stu .
go see stu .
go see stu !
okay , stay there .
don' t move .
i' m coming in .
i just have to be with my cousin .
she has this rare disease that makes you gag and you can' t breathe and then you die .
she shouldn' t be left alone .
she' s alone , the one who' s gagging and not breathing .
i have to be with her at all times .
okay .
good plan .
maybe we should just go to the hotel .
what ?
and miss the concert ?
yeah , i don' t think so .
we' re not actually at the concert .
we' re close .
stu wolff' s only a few yards away from us .
and then he' il be at the after party with us .
your belief system amazes me .
ella , where are you going ?
don' t leave me !
come back !
ella !
ella , what are you doing ?
i' m going back to the hotel .
so you' re just gonna give up ?
what if everyone gave up , ella ?
there' d be no america , no electricity , no tivo .
we' d all have to watch our shows at their scheduled times .
we' d never get to see the work of rene zellweger or christina aguilera .
if everyone gave up , we' d all be sitting in mud huts in europe eating weeds .
i didn' t say stop progress .
i just said , " go back to the hotel .
don' t you want to see the look on carla' s face when we show up at that party ?
yeah , i do .
great !
then let' s go to soho .
where in soho ?
we don' t even know where stu lives .
sure , we do .
i have this .
a picture of a door ?
it' s not just a door .
it' s a black door with windows .
have some faith , ella .
soho is new york' s artistic soul .
it' s just around the corner .
67 blocks is around the corner ?
ready ?
yeah .
ready ?
ohh .
there' s a man following us .
don' t be silly , ella .
the crime rate in new york is going down .
come on .
let' s go .
there' s a man and a dog following us .
okay .
stay here .
i' il handle this .
new yorkers know how to handle trouble .
watch this .
hey !
hey !
dad , what are you doing here ?
your mom called .
asked me to keep an eye on you .
she got nervous .
mom was born nervous .
so , where are you going ?
to a party .
not like that .
you' re all wet .
daddy , nothing can rain on my parade .
i like parties .
please , dad , if you show up , then stu wolff will never think i' m cool .
can' t you wait outside or something ?
right outside .
but if i see something even slightly wrong , i' m coming in .
you know , i really like parties .
thanks , dad .
and could you lay low ?
you' re scaring my friend .
right .
but i' il be watching .
well , he won' t be bothering us anymore .
so , are you ready to have fun ?
i hope so .
okay .
good .
yeah !
that was the santini car .
hi !
lola steppe .
ella gerard .
nice to see you again .
i have to see your invitations .
strange you should ask .
we left them at the concert .
our names should be on the list .
there they are .
dr. and mrs. lawrence ?
yeah .
my mom and my dad .
they couldn' t make it .
my mom has a rash , and my dad' s in surgery .
i thought your name was steppe .
could i just use your phone ?
i have to call my parents .
this is a private residence , not grand central station .
use a public phone .
whoa , whoa !
stu , this is your own party !
it' s your own party .
you don' t tell me what to do anymore , steve .
don' t you remember ?
it' s over .
come inside before you embarrass yourself .
you touch me ...
yeah , remember ?
he' s been trouble all over the world .
thank god he' s not our problem anymore .
steve !
steve !
i love you .
wait , let me just talk to you for one minute .
except for the garbage and the cars , it' s like following heathcliff on the moors .
maybe we shouldn' t .
would you please relax ?
i' d rather lose him than lose my life .
where do you think he' s going ?
someplace great .
this for you is great ?
i' m getting really scared being out here all alone , lola .
we' re not alone .
we' re with an adult .
aside from the fact that he isn' t actually with us , he isn' t actually an adult .
he' s a rock star .
mr. wolff ?
what ?
come with me .
come on .
help me get him out .
oh .
oh .
he smells like a backed up drain .
ella , ella , ella .
i mean , see the beauty .
oh , my god .
he' s crying .
do you believe how lucky we are ?
i almost hear them praying that we don' t sit near them .
quickly get him into a booth before anyone smells him .
ah .
ohh .
everybody wants something from me .
you think i' m a regular guy .
i' m not a regular guy .
do you think anybody really knows who i am ?
i don' t even know who i am .
once we get some coffee in him , he' il become the man of truth , passion , and unflagging courage i know him to be .
so , what will it be ?
do you think i have any real friends ?
we' il just have coffee .
not me .
i' il have a deluxe hamburger platter , well done , and a large side of onion rings .
you could just give him coffee .
he' s not really up to a meal right now .
i want a deluxe hamburger platter .
is that too difficult ?
you two better keep him in line .
the boss won' t stand for any nonsense .
what do you want ?
autographs ?
money ?
a record deal ?
hey , there , girls , do you want something from me ?
this is a poet who lit your darkest days ?
didn' t i tell you he was a tortured soul ?
stu , do you have any cash on you ?
we sort of left ours on the train .
i knew you wanted money .
look .
nothing .
that' s not onion rings .
can you believe this ?
we' re actually having coffee with stu wolff .
i have so much to ask you about your work .
it' s impossible to talk to someone who' s had that much to drink .
you know , you just don' t understand the artistic soul .
he drinks so much to numb the intensity of his feelings .
all geniuses do , ella .
i want onion rings .
this is a donut !
i want onion rings .
now .
what is wrong with the service around here ?
are we together ?
who are you ?
the fates have sort of brought us together .
this is ella .
ella what ?
ella gerard .
58 birch hollow road , dellwood , new jersey .
201 555 0199 .
my parents are staying at the new york hilton .
i don' t want to worry them by being incarcerated .
it' s my mother' s birthday .
i bought her a rug .
be quiet , mr. wolff .
you ?
lola steppe .
my father' s name is calum steppe .
address is 512 bleecker street .
212 555 0125 .
all right , the three of you , sit over there while i make some calls .
what' s wrong with you ?
why did you lie like that to the police ?
they' re gonna find out that your father is dead .
what' s going on ?
who are you two ?
what' s wrong with you ?
you' re not afraid of what your parents are gonna say ?
i' m resigned to what life may bring , but why did you give a false address ?
you know , ella , i think your true soul and spirit are finally beginning to emerge .
why did you lie ?
i didn' t lie .
my father does live on bleecker street .
and he has a rent controlled apartment and a dog named negus .
you told me your father died in a motorcycle accident .
so i exaggerated a little .
a little ?
exaggerating a little is saying you' re a little taller .
saying your father is dead when he' s not is lying beyond comprehension .
can we talk about this later ?
we should tell stu what happened first .
you should tell me what happened .
why did you say your father was dead ?
he died ?
when ?
i had a reason .
and what was that ?
the truth ?
no , a lie will do .
yes , the truth !
you do remember what that is , don' t you ?
were we in a diner ?
i have an image of " merry xmas .
just give me a moment .
i' d be happy to explain .
right now i' m talking to her .
all right .
the total truth .
i lied because i wanted to make myself seem more interesting .
more interesting ?
we are 1, 000 miles from home in a new york police station with a drunken rock star waiting for your dead father to show up .
you want to be more interesting ?
more interesting than what ?
you know , you just don' t understand .
it was a new town and a new school .
i understand .
and i lied for my mom .
i had to protect her against suburbia .
your parents didn' t get her .
so you killed your father ?
ella !
i would appreciate it if you would just stop talking .
ella , come on .
what' s going on ?
arrest that man !
he' s a stalker .
ella , dad .
dad , ella .
hi .
i' m calum steppe , her father .
what happened ?
that' s what i' ve been asking .
as the night continued to fall on the dark , heartless streets around the precinct , the six of us gathered around the sergeant , and i told our tale .
we were desperate to get into this man' s concert because i consider him to be the greatest poet since shakespeare .
we lost our money , and we couldn' t pay a scalper .
then we tried to crash his party rather than have our dreams forever denied .
when he stormed out of his loft , we followed him to make sure he didn' t come into any harm .
i' m having memory flashes .
i was passed out amongst the rubbish .
i believe they helped me .
i know i should be furious , but it' s too late for fury .
i' m just thankful nothing worse happened .
he looks like the dog in " the dog years .
he is the dog in " the dog years .
he' s the dog in " the dog years " ?
my niece loves those books .
you' re famous !
he' s not as famous as you .
molly' s not gonna believe i' ve actually met you .
negus , right ?
and calum steppe , right ?
right .
we checked your story , and you' re free to go .
excuse me , mr. wolff ?
mm hmm .
can i have your autograph ?
oh , yeah , sure .
sure .
to sergeant rose .
stu wolff .
right , well , now that that' s settled , would anyone like to come to a party with me ?
i would .
you can' t stay mad at me forever .
forgive me , please ?
i am in no way ready to forgive you .
this is the party of the century .
don' t you want to enjoy it ?
i' m not really in a partying mood .
look , i' m sorry .
i really am .
i' m sorry .
you' re just saying that to save the evening .
no , i' m not .
i honestly don' t know what i' d do without you .
what' s going on ?
why are you still out here ?
we just don' t feel like going in right now .
well , then .
let me get you back to the hotel .
maybe we can just go in for a little while .
hi !
there you are !
all right .
listen , how about we get you guys something dry to wear ?
i' il have those dresses cleaned and sent over to your dad' s , who is brilliant , by the way .
i think he and i are gonna be pals .
yeah , i bought all his books .
just upstairs .
i don' t see her , do you ?
no .
can you believe this ?
we' re in his clothes .
and in his bedroom .
come on , ella .
celebrate with me , please .
i want everything to be okay between us .
and i do , too .
you have to promise that you' il never lie to me again .
i do .
i promise .
i swear , ella .
i do .
you promise ?
i do .
okay .
okay , then .
come on , we' re in his room .
what do you want to do ?
i don' t know .
that is so gross .
carla !
hey , carla !
we' ve been looking for you .
did you see her face ?
she looks really angry .
i know that look .
you know , life can be so randomly beautiful .
come on , girls !
oh , my god !
my saviors .
oh , my god .
oh , it' s steve .
it' s steve !
hang on .
stu , i know you' re really busy .
i was wondering if i could talk to you .
why not ?
be my guest .
i can' t believe i met you .
i mean , i can' t believe i' m sitting here with the man who wrote all those songs that made my spirit soar .
what were you thinking when you wrote
behind some doors people are waiting to sparkle " ?
i have no idea .
but you wrote it .
life' s a little foggy , a little soggy .
you know , that really said something to me .
i' m sure to a hundred million other girls , but especially to me .
i' m happy to oblige a fan .
no .
i' m not just a fan .
i mean , i sat at your feet , metaphorically .
when i listen to " always morning ,
i wore a gray jacket because you wore a gray jacket on the cd .
you wore gray because it was ambiguous .
am i right ?
no .
i' m right .
you look disappointed .
well , i am .
in me .
yeah .
i mean , i still think you' re the greatest thing since shakespeare .
it' s just too bad
i' il never be able to discuss your poetry with you .
why ?
because , mr. wolff , you' re a drunk .
i hope getting this thing back is easier than getting it out .
guess what !
i' ve been grounded .
me too !
i' m so proud of you !
this is the day i' ve been waiting for since my first summer camp when carla told all the kids that if they played with me , they' d die .
she' s smiling .
oh , she' s bluffing .
well , look , i gotta get to class .
tell me how it goes .
come on .
let' s watch her sink .
yeah .
yeah , this one .
look at this one .
hey , carla .
did you have fun ?
well , if it isn' t the great pretender .
come to hear what the sidarthur party was like ?
why would we want to hear what you have to say ?
ella and i were there .
did you hear that ?
she said they were there .
you know , lying' s not gonna help you .
everybody already knows that you didn' t go .
don' t pretend you didn' t see us .
i know you did .
it just so happens ella and i got in because of stu wolff himself after we practically saved his life .
tell them , ella .
i don' t have anything to prove , nor do you .
ella , this is no time for your newfound personality .
maybe you' d like to see some pictures from the party , lola .
i know how fond you are of stu wolff , and i got some great shots of him .
we spent the whole night with stu .
on the night of his biggest party , he left to be with you .
you' re not gonna get away with this .
we were at that party .
my dad was there .
he and stu are gonna get together .
what dad ?
you don' t have a dad .
you said he died before you moved here .
i mean , what do you do ?
do you just make all this up as you go along ?
do you think because we' re not from new york that we' re stupid ?
you saw us there .
no , i didn' t , liar .
you know , that' s what you are .
you' re a liar .
your name isn' t even lola , mary .
ella' s right .
i don' t have to prove anything to you people .
you know we were there .
oh , no !
she' s crying .
look at the baby .
oh .
yo , you got no right to write down what i' m saying .
those are my
i' m sorry , miss baggoli , i can' t go on .
there' s something i have to say .
well , quickly , lola .
quickly .
i have a confession to make .
i borrowed eliza' s dress for the weekend .
i' m really sorry , but i felt i had no other choice .
no choice ?
why ?
i had to wear it to the sidarthur party .
when are you gonna give it up , mary ?
no , you didn' t .
you couldn' t have taken that dress because i keep that dress locked up safe in the drama room .
there are ways , miss baggoli .
there are ways .
where is it now ?
it' s right back .
it' s safe and sound .
it looks exactly the same , but somehow different .
can you believe her ?
i mean , first , she takes the dress .
then , she puts it back .
and then she goes to this party where no one saw her .
it' s true !
the dress got all wet .
stu wolff made me change into something dry .
he said it was important that i felt comfortable .
because on the night of his farewell concert ,
stu wolff had nothing better to do than see mary steppe dry .
girls , please !
he sent it back to my dad in a limousine as big as this stage .
a dress in a limousine .
can you picture it ?
he' s also a big fan of my dad and my dad' s dog .
then your dog gave him his autograph , right ?
but i did take the dress !
see , stu wolff gave me this himself .
it' s his t shirt from his tour .
where would i have gotten it ?
in a junk store where you get everything else .
but this is the tissue i used to wipe his tears .
maybe we should send it off for dna testing .
i left my bottle cap necklace at his house .
he told my dad he' s gonna fed ex it back .
a dress riding in a limousine .
i guess that' s a good thing because otherwise it would have had to catch a cab .
you' re funny , lola .
you could be a comedienne .
but can we please go back to work now ?
we have so much to do before wednesday night .
you believe me , don' t you ?
carla' s the one who' s lying .
we' ve worked so hard for this production , lola .
and i am not gonna let you ruin it for me .
we have all had enough .
have you ?
have you finally had enough ?
i sunk into a depression that only hamlet would recognize .
the one story i' d told that was both probable and possible was the one that was true .
and yet no one believed me .
maybe you can never win against the carla santinis of this world .
i' d never felt so totally defeated .
i felt more like a pigeon than a flamingo .
mary ?
ella' s here .
go ahead .
i want to talk to you .
i don' t really feel too well .
you can cut the crap .
i know what you' re doing .
what happened to the most polite girl in all of new jersey ?
what does it matter anymore ?
we know we went to the party .
we know who we met and what we did .
get up !
i can' t .
i just can' t .
has anyone seen lola steppe ?
has anyone seen lola steppe ?
lola ?
you know , i really am sick .
i mean , ask my mom .
i' m not buying it .
you' re bailing out of the play .
you know , here i am , so sick this could turn into pneumonia , and then i' il be on my deathbed , and you' re being accusatory .
you can' t do this , lola .
everyone is depending on you .
what about your parents and sam ?
sam has never been to a school function in his life .
he' s only going because of you .
lola !
lola steppe , my eliza .
get out of my way .
one hour till curtain .
what about me ?
i was miserable until you came to dellwood .
i thought everyone' s life was like mine .
doing everything you' re supposed to do when you' re supposed to do it .
never questioning anything .
the only thing i could expect when i grew up was a life like my parents ' .
and then i met you .
you gave me courage , lola .
because of you , i' m brave enough to be different .
don' t touch me !
you' re a sham !
the one thing carla can' t do anything about is you being eliza doolittle .
you' re just gonna hand it to her .
mary , i left word with your dad .
should i call miss baggoli ?
no .
i' ve had a miraculous recovery .
i need to be sure .
are you up to this ?
up to it ?
miss baggoli , i was born to play eliza .
get into costume for the opening .
knock ' em dead !
knock ' em dead !
it even amazes me that i get everything that i want .
get out of my dress .
as of right now , i' m eliza .
get out of my dress !
enjoy the show .
thanks .
i will .
oh , and get out of my first costume !
five minutes till curtain , people .
five minutes .
get out of my dress .
no !
get out of my dress !
no !
get out of that dress !
ohh !
sorry , miss baggoli .
i' m so glad to see you .
do you want an ice cream ?
hey .
you' re gonna be great .
i' m scared .
i' il admit it .
but i' m excited , too .
don' t be afraid .
you' re gonna be wonderful , lola .
you called me lola .
you are a lola .
good luck !
press your bars , children .
yo , you gots no rights to write down what i' m saying .
those are my personal words .
now say " new york .
new yolk .
new york .
with an " r.
new rolk .
you can' t talk .
let' s see if you can walk .
ugh !
they all accepted her because of me .
all because of you ?
i was there , too !
i worked hard to make you look good !
well , what will you do now , dear ?
i will be a teacher because being a teacher is the most worthy thing a person can be .
bravo !
stu wolff ?
i don' t believe this .
did my father invite you here ?
no .
may i come in anyway ?
yes !
yeah , sure , of course .
i don' t believe this .
this is crazy .
lola' s father said she would be here .
you' re here in my house because of lola ?
you know what ?
why don' t you stay here ?
you stay .
and i' m gonna go get her .
and i' m gonna go get her .
you stay .
so i can' t come in ?
look who came to see me .
hey , guys .
look who' s here .
is that stu wolff ?
look who came to my house .
hey , ella .
i just wanted to say
lola !
you left this at my place .
i had pictured this moment in my craziest , wildest dreams .
i guess if you don' t dream crazy and wild , people like stu wolff don' t return your jewelry personally .
aah !
come on .
it' s just a hand .
thanks for showing up .
so , how have you been ?
sober .
i' m in recovery .
again .
someone very sweet told me i was a drunk , and i didn' t like it .
sounds kind of harsh .
but it woke me up .
so , maybe sometime soon we can talk about your amazing music .
just say when .
i can say when ?
within reason .
would you like to dance ?
absolutely .
here' s what i learned .
when you' re happy , the whole world' s new york .
and that dreams are important .
someday , when you' re not even looking , they find you .
and then there' s sam .
he' d been there all along , but when i opened my heart to him , i thought , now that my career is launched , maybe i could have a boyfriend .
it was the first time i realized that absolute reality could be so much more fun than fantasy .
and can you believe all of this happened in dellwood , new jersey , of all places ?
