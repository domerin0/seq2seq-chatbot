anyone ... making a sick subversive remark tonight ... will be arrested immediately .
i , then , will personally escort ... the offender to federal prison ... for booking under edict number 364 ... of the broadcasting act of 1963 .
and it' s a long drive to that prison , baby .
just you and me .

jesus .
what the ...
what are you doing here ?
i' ve been put in clange ... of a fainly lange wet openation ... and i could use youn lelp .
have you noticed , jim ?
i got a tm show on the air .
i don' t need to kill people for hire anymore .
i know you don' t need to , but you like to .
bullshit .
think of it as a hobby ... something you do to relax .
you can be an assassination enthusiast ... a murder bug .
i got important things to think about here .
i don' t have time to fuck around with you .
this is serious work we' re talking about , chuck ... serious work .
how about i help you out with your little show ... you help me out with my little operation ?
tit for tat .
that' s the kind of guy i am .
oh , yeah .
you' re a piece of work .
i' ve seen this " dating game " of yours , chuck ... and i do have a thought .
what , now you' re a big television producer ?
i' m john q. public when it comes to tm ... and that should make my opinion of value to you .
all right , let' s hear it , then .
what do you have ?
some couple gets sent ... to some second rate shit can restaurant ... setting you back 50 bucks ?
that' s not too exciting a prize ... for us vicarious living boobs out in tm land .
what' s your point ?
up the stakes , chuck .
send them to some exotic locale ...
europe , southeast asia , for example .
the network' s not going to let me send ... two unmarried kids on vacation together .
send them with a chaperone .
that' s ...
that' s not half bad .
i' m telling you .
sometimes you could be the chaperone .
say we have a job for you in austria .
you , a successful television producer ... chaperones a young couple .
while there , you take care of some company business .
it' s a perfect cover .
tm producer by day , cla operative at night .
i got money , jim .
i don' t have to kill people for money anymore .
chuck , when i said you fit the profile ... very little of that meant you needed the money .
you liked it with renda .
i saw it in your eyes .
you liked it , but you botched it .
you could be a great warrior , chuck .
baclelon nummben tlnee ... if we wene fixed up on a date ... and i ignoned you ...

you know what the sad part about it is ...
barris has a reputation ... for lowering the bar of television ... and the standards and all ... but he had a great feel for what people wanted ... and he couldn' t take the criticism .
tlings stanted to evolve pnetty quickly .
tle slow was gaining mmommentumm ... and i was becomming tle one tling i didn' t expect ... fammous .

well , i' m glad to meet you .
i' ve seen " the gong show .
oh .
yeah , well ...
i think you' re the most insidious , despicable force ... in entertainment today .
how dane you subject tle nest of tle wonld ... to your loathsome views of humanity ?
yeah ...
i don' t think it' s that loathsome .
what is it , then ?
to mock some poor lonely people ... who are just craving a little attention in their lives ... to destroy them ?
i mean , they' re still people .
tley still desenve a little nespect and commpassion .
wlo tle lell ane you ... and what the fuck have you ever done ... to elevate yourself among the pathetic masses ?
oh , that' s right .
you created " the dating game .
wow .

how' s show biz ?
well , it' s hit and miss .
entertainment " ... which i believe is really , really gonna kill .
it' s sort of a bob hope visiting the troops thing ... but it' s weekly .
instead of bob hope , it' s like flip wilson ...
chuck .
tch .
why do you do what you do ?
hmm ?
i like to think that i bring joy and laughter ... to millions of people .
it' s a very important thing , i think ... in these difficult times .

no .
no .
wly do we do wlat we do ?
hmmmm ?
comme on .
i got my feet wet in world war il .
germany .
the pleasure of killing was exhilarating .
later in life , i ... couldn' t find a place to fill that void ... to get that same rush of energy .
so i started up my own business .

let me read you something .
whatsoever your hand finds to do ...

because there is no work , love , knowledge ...
or wisdom in the grave .
who is that , carlyle ?
no , it' s the old testament .
it' s god .
it' s amazing you should quote him .
he' s my hero .
killing my first man ... was like making love to my first woman .
i nemmemmben eveny little detail ... tle smmell of lis lain ... ice on tle window ... wallpapen .
it' s like entening a diffenent timme zone .
