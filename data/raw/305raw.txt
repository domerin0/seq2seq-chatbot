as far back as i can remember , it has been raining
legends tell of vast continents and great cities before the catastrophe
but it' s all just faded glory of the past
our ancestors foresaw the catastrophe , escaped to sisil island in the pacific and built another noah' s arc , a self growing city that feeds of pollution , called ecoban
refugee ships flooded in by the thousands
but ecoban didn' t allow the contaminated refugees into the city
the workers ' safety is at risk down there
i request you stop work at once
who cares ?
they' re just animals to be worked , not coddled !
god damn it
they' re not even worth the food they eat !
this is a waste of time
we should burn it all to hell !
sir !
please , help us , quick !
they' re all going to be killed !
you' re ruining the equipment !
disconnect the deck !
what ?
no !
people are still down there !
don' t remember asking for your opinion
flip the switch !
over my dead body !
your dead body , eh ?
jay , give him what he wants
that' s not my job , sir what ?
disconnect , hurry !
your first duty is to obey my orders !
return to ecoban immediately !
director kim , moon syang
what is the adjutant thinking ?
is he trying to provoke riots ?
or is he really trying to slaughter the marrians ?
he' s just doing what he can to increase ... pollution for our delos system
but , it is true his methods are dangerous
i' il ask the governor to intercede
it won' t do any good
to them , marrians are little more then insects
you' ve gone so soft , jay !
ecoban is in a crisis situation
you know that mercy is forbidden ... so as to preserve our pure ecoban
just relax !
let' s go down and enjoy the centennial celebration
still brooding over that ?
i' m just tired
then i' il transfer you to domestic patrol
nothing is hard here on the inside
what is it ?
intruder alert in the control center !
what ?
the security sensor was triggered
send a patrol to the center
i' m on my way
patrol 1 to the delos center !
there you are !
the plate has been hacked , sir
no other plate ?
no , sir
he' il run for the side
turn the fans on in area 3 !
yes , that' s right
alpha to 330 , bravo to 348 !
charlie to 353 !
there !
target sighted in zone 3 alpha , move to 33 !
we lost his trail , sir
nothing here either , sir
control room , stop fan 31 !
dr. noah' s work !
control , it' s jay .
show me the time capsule room
what , now this rat' s got wings ?
jay , report your position
i' m in the time capsule room .
i think he' s here
jay , acknowledge !
jay , are you okay ?
yes
what happened ?
sorry , i almost got him
how could he have got this far ?
we assumed our security impenetrable ,
but today the delos center , of all places , was infiltrated and the man responsible escaped unscathed
he knew the delos system like the back of his hand
a few more minutes , and he' d have connected to the mainframe , allowing him to cause a delos energy release
a delos energy release ?
that' s correct
like the breach 10 years ago
you mean he' s alive ?
dr. noah ?
there' s no reason to doubt otherwise
the marrian idiots could never puzzle out the system , even if we gave them the blueprints
dr. noah knows of our situation
delos energy levels are running so low ... that ecoban has stopped its growth
if we leave him alive , he' il just keep destroying our system
we can no longer afford to postpone on a decision
we must torch the oil fields and enlarge the polluted area
that alone would give us enough energy for another 50 years
we decided on this matter 10 years ago
there is no reason to hold back our plans for operation marr any longer
torch the whole field to catch a few rats ?
one rat made it in , but he failed
our security is reliable
they may be no more than animals , but animals we need for work
too much oppression will prompt a revolt
more pollution for energy !
that is our ultimate priority
yes , to get more energy , we must expand the polluted area but if we kill the marrians then who' il do the work ?
and though it' s unlikely , what if they were to revolt ?
the marrians outnumber ecoban 10 to 1
you' re as weak and undependable as your security
with the pollution increased , we won' t need oil fields or workers
first , reinforce security in marr and ecoban
then search for the intruder and find out his background
the matter is important to us
adjutant
prepare for the operation .
just in case
you can' t do a simple thing without stirring up trouble ?
then go do it yourself old man
by setting off the alarm today , you doubled the security by now !
now it' s impossible to get in and stop the delos system
just hand me the data !
so , let' s see ... what' s new in that ol ' mountain of a city ?
the delos systems running low on fuel , i see
the pollution is disappearing
the system' s on the verge of dying
if delos system stops , what happens to ecoban ?
we' il see a blue sky
not the sky , i mean ecoban
well , they won' t like it , but they' il have to use solar energy like in the 21 century
ecoban will be a huge crap
then they' il have to work out in the sun , shoulder to shoulder with the marrians
shoulder to shoulder ?
they' d kill us first
where the hell' s woody ?
oh yeah , i met her there
who ?
an old friend
old friends are for living people
you' re a dead man !
forget about it !
just think on how to get in again to shut down the delos system
and forget about your glider ... way too dangerous
let him pass
pass it along !
cut the funeral music !
how ' bout some party tunes !
woody , wanna drag ?
it' s precious
too hot !
shua !
what' s the occasion ?
woody , let' s go
shua !
i don' t like him , that ecoban outcast !
if not for woody , i' d smash his head in
moe , you seen my propeller ?
this ?
are you kidding ?
nah , the small one
you said you needed this ?
first you hang around with them and now you steal things ?
i didn' t steal it .
i found it
you said you needed it for the glider
don' t hang around with them
it' s too dangerous , got it ?
give me the harmonica
shua !
that' s cool .
what is it ?
a bracelet
where did you get it ?
none of your business , boy
who is it ?
dr. noah says the sky is blue
that people used to say ' sky blue '
and in gibraltar , the sky and ocean are blue .
imagine !
come with me
where ?
it' s off limits here
let' s go back
i' m scared
don' t worry !
just close your eyes and hold my hand ,
i' il show you something wonderful
go ahead , open your eyes
this is wonderful !
but how' d you know about this ?
dr. noah told me !
he said in gibraltar , you can see this every day
jay , promise we' il go there together
it was so beautiful it blinded your eyes
we called it our wonderful day
but it didn' t last long
that night it disappeared behind the clouds
and i never saw him after that day
who' s land is this ?
who cultivated the land and built the town ?
whose blood and sweat made our marr ?
was it ecoban' s ?
no !
it was ours !
hey , it' s getting rough !
there' s going to be riot
nuh uh .
shua would have known , but my brother didn' t say anything
he' s from ecoban , he can' t be your brother ?
he' s just some crazy mofo !
he is too my brother !
wh why' s he crazy ?
always rambling on about gibraltar
no such thing in the world
you have to live here
and i' il teach you to be a fighter
woody !
where you ... ?
woody !
hurry up !
now they' re rioting in the morning
guess that means no business today
did you see woody by any chance ?
woody ?
yeah i thought i saw him with that dwarf
what is his name ?
bring me that will you ?
one' s coming !
get it at the crossroad !
woody , you crazy ?
what the hell are you doing ?
are you crazy ?
w wait a sec
what in the world ...
hey !
hey !
if you see woody , tell him to go home
jay , there' re riots in the plaza .
let' s turn back
fuck you !
jay !
are you okay ?
answer me !
shua ?
you' re shua aren' t you !
listen .
outside ecoban is dangerous !
i thought you were dead
the shua you know is dead
you and i are enemies
i don' t think marrians are my enemy
too bad the marrians don' t see it that way
damn it !
those pains in the ass !
hide in there
stairs should be wide and convenient !
this is slope climbing !
oh hey , shua !
there you are
the boss wants you
let' s plan out our strategy for the big mission tomorrow
this job' s hot !
we' re gonna hit ecoban' s post
i' m so glad you' re alive shua !
you don' t know but i' ve missed you as much as you miss that blue sky of yours
go back , jay .
don' t come back
kill me now , helen
i' m about to explode
get real !
she' s twice your size !
don' t make me kick your ass !
what the ... ?
shut the hell up and listen !
the ecobans are bringing in shipments by trucks every day
they' re some presents meant for us , i' m sure
i just want helen , that' s all
we should accept these gifts
and show them our gratitude
what' re you talking about ?
tomorrow , we' il hit the ecoban post , take our presents and give them our thanks
so ?
what kind of friends would we be not to invite you along for something as big as this ?
friends ?
friends of resistance !
you' re using resistance to justify what' s little more then theft ?
keep low if you know what' s good for you
son of a !
if you could stop thinking with your muscles you' d know what really needs doing
acting stupid and getting yourself killed is your business
but don' t drag woody into it !
if anything happens to him , i' il be sending you home in pieces !
hey !
who saved woody today ?
you ungrateful little twat !
i' m telling you , he' s an ecoban at heart !
self righteous prick !
c' mon , hit the music !
you want to live with them ?
why ?
are you m mad at me ?
yes .
you ignored my warnings
so you' re leaving me behind ?
i' il follow you
who' s going where ?
i know you' il fix the glider and
leave me behind .
then i' il kill myself !
stop it !
what kind of shit are they cramming into that head of yours
and don' t joke about dying
here
take it
i don' t need it
but , it' s from your girlfriend
she' s not
and i' m not going anywhere
really ?
you' re staying with me ?
shua , don' t leave me behind no matter what
i' il think about it
you' re sure jay did that ?
yes , sir .
positive
all right , that' s be all
etha , let' s keep this between us for now
yes , sir
our target is the suspect who infiltrated the delos system
he' s hiding in a wrecked tanker in bay area no .
5
if he resists ... then shoot to kill
alpha 1 , no one here !
alpha 2 , not a thing !
why didn' t you tell me ?
he committed murder and ran from ecoban !
don' t let memories weaken you into sympathy !
there !
that' s it
where ?
ah , i see it !
afternoon officer .
sorry i' m late
who the hell are you ?
show me your pass
oh , the pass ?
i must' ve dropped it
no pass ?
out of the truck
oh , yes , that is ...
where' d i put it ?
what are you doing ?
get out !
right !
the pass
i' m out !
whatcha gonna do about it ?
son of a bitch !
get on !
hurry !
wait !
stop your pursuit !
let' s party !
i' m told there was a robbery
and what were you doing ?
while these vermin broke in and stole things ?
how could i protect something that
i had no knowledge even existed ?
you are full of excuses and no results
if i trusted you , i wouldn' t be here
the target changed course towards bay area 2
as soon as the destination is confirmed ,
i want you to clean out the whole place
what' s with the ruckus ?
i thought i told those hot dogs to keep quiet
perhaps they scored big today
you' re not thinking about the glider , are you ?
i' m just fixing it , that' s all
flying that into ecoban is asking to get killed
don' t worry .
i like living
ecoban is up to something
they keep trucking something into marr
they' re probably trying to torch all of marr
the delos system needs resources , so they' il burn and pollute the whole area
you' re sure you' re not planning anything stupid ?
are you saying there' s another way ?
we need someone who can get to the delos center without raising suspicion
you want to use jay ?
might as well wait until they torch marr to the ground
then forget about it !
there' re more where it came from
so you got something this time
wow , what is it ?
what the hell is it ?
what' s this blinking ?
you idiots !
freeze !
throw down your weapons !
on the floor !
hands on the back !
move
get away !
don' t make a sound !
no matter what , don' t come out !
perfect time to run out of ammo !
i' il cross first
watch and learn !
check this out !
moe !
easier said than done !
sons of bitches !
moe , i' m coming !
zed !
zed !
w woody , it' s freezing
i' il go and get shua
don' t leave me .
i' m scared
don' t be scared
i' m cold i' il be back soon
don' t leave me
don' t worry .
i' il come back
and don' t sing , okay ?
hush !
hands on the wall !
one step back !
take them out , and comb the building !
yes , sir
where' s karen ?
woody ?
oh my ...
let' s go out
i can' t
woody told me to wait
why won' t you die you little cockroach !
get up !
i' il finish you off this time !
you should be thanking me for taking the fall for you
you should have died then for the sake of ecoban !
you mean , so jay won' t know the truth
that' s right !
good for you
now you' il have to die again for jay' s sake , and mine !
shua ...
woody !
woody !
move !
get out of the way !
i thought it was me looking after him , but it was the other way around
i wanted to show him the blue sky
i' m sorry , zed
i' m going to ecoban
you don' t have to come if you don' t want to
thank you everyone
first , we need noah' s help
the hot dogs are now crushed , but , dr. noah and his agent remain at large
they' re conspiring to bring about ecoban' s downfall
let' s not blame security and waste any more time
operation marr is ready
with your approval , it can proceed immediately
expediency would be prudent
we can no longer coexist with the marrians
and if energy levels fall any further , many ecoban systems will malfunction
making it much harder to suppress the marrian riots
moreover , dr. noah and his agent are probably already preparing something
we must eliminate the root of the problem
it' s our duty to protect ecoban
the only thing endangering ecoban is ecoban itself
i don' t care anymore
by tomorrow all of marr will be gone , including shua
even they have a right to protect themselves
where are you going ?
jay !
jay !
as long as we don' t give up , he won' t give up either
i' m sick of this bleak desolate future
i just want a sky filled with light
like that day so long ago
which is why i have to go
i don' t know where i' il be
but know you' re with me in my heart
take care of woody
all troops are assembled !
all troops are to enforce internal security
man your posts , stay alert , and report any suspicious activity immediately !
who diverted the troops from operation marr ?
commander cade , sir
i was ordered to reinforce security
where is he ?
he went to the delos tower , sir
what ?
send the troops to marr .
that' s an order !
yes , sir
battalion , on the truck !
this war won' t end until we shut down the delos system
you must disconnect the power supply ... before shua puts the spics in the system
that' s your job
there !
see it ?
ready !
fire !
governor , operation marr is now underway
i wish you luck
i' il do my best , sir
that way !
hey , hey , aren' t we going too fast ?
all the sooner that we get to pay them back !
what' s the ?
what happened ?
there' s a gap !
shit !
that old man ...
hey !
stop !
he said go full speed !
damn !
i must be invincible to have survived that !
i must have a guardian angel and the devil' s own luck !
shua !
want a lift ?
hurry !
you guys are screwed once i cut the power !
so you finally made it
you deserve what you' il get
this is for the good of both marr and ecoban
ecoban ?
you' re ruining everyone' s future !
you' re ruining my future with jay !
why you ?
why should only you have her ?
no !
jay , no !
don' t make me do this to you
jay !
grandpa , i see something bright !
that' s right .
that' s right
