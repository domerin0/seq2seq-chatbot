alderman .
inspector rimgale .
i ... need to get in that trunk .
oh , excuse me .
thanks .
pretty fancy shoes you' re wearing for a fire scene .
guess you haven' t been to many fires .
we wanted to talk to you about alan seagrave' s death .
we still haven' t gotten a fire report .
you' il get that answer as soon as i do , ma' am .
a man gets stuffed through the windshield of his own car .
is that an accident or arson ?
people are asking me .
i gotta tell ' em something .
we' re starting to get the feeling your office is dragging out this case ... to embarrass the alderman because of his fire department cutbacks .
i have an uncomplicated job : to decide if a fire is arson .
if so , to catch the son of a bitch doing it .
if my investigative methods happen to muck up ... the campaign of certain mayor wanna be' s ,
i gotta tell you ,
i' m not going to lose any sleep over it .
i' m sure you' re gonna have that report on my desk as soon as it' s ready .
you' il have it .
thank you .
that guy better not make any rights on reds in my district .
hey , swayzak ?
you missed it .
get over there .
keep ' em busy .
you should' ve been there .
it was fucking great !
we almost lost a whole goddamn company for you .
since you shut down 33 , there' s no fucking backup .
we appreciate it .
i don' t know about the rest ,
but you got my vote for mayor .
if you have a problem , help us .
work with the task force .
the task force ?
three guys have died because of cuts made by your fucking task force !
know that little glow that' s starting to blink in the corner of your eye ?
that' s your career dissipation light .
it went into overtime .
come on , man .
no .
if anybody' s lights are about to go out , believe me , they' re yours .
thanks a lot , fellas .
you did a great job today , by the way .
alderman , will this affect your task force findings ?
no more today .
good bye .
so this is that big city job you were talking about .
yeah .
welcome home , brian .
where' s that fucking guy buy his shoes ?
did you check those out ?
they' re like fucking butter .
yoo hoo !
hey , g man !
get outta here .
do you have to do that ?
yeah .
could you believe that fire ?
there we were , adcox and me ... pulling that lady right out of the fire' s fucking throat .
we saved a life , man !
whoo hoo hoo !
i love it here !
fighting 17th !
goddamn !
stephen' s amazing .
you see how he took that fire ?
by the balls !
i' m gonna be that good someday .
you watch .
you' il see .
you know what stephen said to me ?
when the shit was coming hard , he said , " you never know ... till the moment the fire stares you down ...
if you' re just gonna do this job " or be great at it , right ?
he using that line of shit on you now ?
you think he made that little gem up ?
my old man used to use that line every other day .
it' s no line , man !
that' s no line .
hey , kid , we ain' t waitin ' !
go , go , go !
let' s go !
no , no , not that way !
what' s going on ?
come on .
let' s go !
it' s lunch , probies !
let' s get started !
ooo , caw , caw !
a couple of crows , man !
that money will probably end up coming from
this better be good .
or we feed you to the thing .
shut up .
you got something against dalmatians ?
accident or murder ?
that' s the question arson investigators are struggling with ... after a freak explosion known by firefighters as a backdraft
hey , pengelly , you' re on tv .
i saw you too !
look , that' s me .
he' s been identified as alan seagrave , a prominent chicago c. p. a.
despite pressure from the city council , fire officials refuse to speculate on the cause , saying only that their investigation is continuing .
gentlemen , gentlemen .
here he goes again .
as 17th' s official toastmaster
and bullshitter .
thank you , santos .
did i mention you were cut out of my will ?
i think it appropriate ... that we recognize the two asswipes ... probationary firemen , among us today , who were officially baptized ... into the world of old man fire .
first , to tim .
despite the fact he was born with a dull expression ... and a really hideous pair of ears , he not only took on the beast , but pulled from its clutches , assisted by a more famous and brilliant firefighter ... me , a kicking and screaming civilian ... who' il probably wind up suing us for breaking her fingernails .
and to brian .
help me , santos .
whose own contribution ... was both more beautiful and less likely to sue us .
son of a bitch .
when i heard that both mccaffrey brothers ... were being assigned here at this station at the same time , my heart was filled with a ... sudden desire to transfer .
so raise a glass , lads , to funny looking tim and the mccaffrey brothers .
for despite the fact ... they' ve gotten on each other' s nerves for years , have managed with great effort to still be pissed off at each other .
gentlemen ...
fuck you !
# war , yeah #
# what is it good for absolutely nothing #
# say it again , y' all war , look out #
# what is it good for absolutely nothing #
# listen to me ohh war #
# i despise ' cause it means #
thanks for the ride .
hey , brian .
i' il see you tonight , huh ?
yeah , i' il see you tonight .
i' ve known jack fitzgerald since he was a candidate .
they had fire engines then ?
get that man' s name !
i gotta say , he was just as ugly then .
can i have a beer , please ?
hey .
how you doin ' ?
hey . ... home of the real firemen .
enough of us stroking each other .
here' s the man we' re here to honor ,
chief jack fitzgerald .
i know i speak for everybody here .
it' s about time you retired ... and made a promotion for somebody else .
think i oughta change the view .
i couldn' t have wished for a better life .
thank you much .
i don' t believe this shit !
pretty boy , get a load of this .
bull , wait' il you listen to this shit .
let me see .
hey hey hey .
probationary fireman , brian mccaffrey , on his first fire , showed the bravery and courage of a veteran ... when he risked life and limb to ...
double check a burning floor , alone .
emerging victoriously with anna rodriquez , a seamstress for the north shore clothing company .
axe , get a load of this shit !
mccaffrey first gained prominence as the subject ... of a 1972 pulitzer prize winning photograph taken ...
at the scene of his father' s death .
that' s me .
what are we gonna do about this ?
hey , 17 , what' s going on ?
well ...
i think that it' s union bylaw ... that if you get your picture in the paper , even if it' s bullshit ,
you buy the whole company a drink .
all right !
i know i' m gonna have another double ... on the hero !
give him a hand over here .
what' s this ?
leave ' em alone .
good job .
# [ irish jig ]
brian mccaffrey , huh ?
brian , this is my boss , alderman swayzak .
he wanted to meet you .
you should be proud of helping to save that woman' s life .
that was a hell of a job .
don' t believe everything you read .
don' t be so modest , brian .
see that ?
that' s a mannequin .
look , brian ,
let me just get down to it , okay ?
i' ve been checking you out .
jennifer can' t say enough .
i need your help .
i' m gonna offer you a job .
i' ve already got a job .
the great thing about this job , it' s still with the fire department .
one of your best investigators , don rimgale , is working a really tough case .
he needs an extra pair of hands .
if that name is gonna come from my office ,
i want it to be you .
why is that ?
i want someone from a real traditional fire fighting clan .
yeah , we got all kinds of traditions ...
like dying young .
thanks anyway .
took you all of 30 seconds to blow that off .
brian , i know it' s not my place to say this , but i think you' re passing on a great opportunity .
you' re smarter than that .
look , jen .
i' m trying to do something here .
can' t you see that ?
i' m trying to be a fireman , not some kind of poster boy for swayzak .
there' s gotta be at least 500 other smoke eaters here ... that do that shit for real every day .
why don' t you tell swayzak to talk to one of them ?
# lost the wanted driver #

was that before or after you noticed you were standing in a lake of gasoline ?
was that before or after you noticed ... you were standing in a lake of gasoline , you idiot ?
before , sir .
you could have burned , killed , or crispered half that company .
you wrecked the physical evidence that i use to prove that it' s arson .
you know how goddamn hard it is to determine the cause .
now go home and you think about that .
i' il have to call him back .
excuse me .
yeah ?
brian mccaffrey , your new assistant .
oh , dennis ' kid .
why don' t you go find a corner to hide in ?
i' il get to you later .
i don' t wanna deal with you now .
great .
you still standing there ?
i think we should get something straight here now .
i was assigned to this office by the city .
you better get used to me .
i know who you were assigned by .
i knew your father too .
he was a hell of a fireman .
he had a hell of a reputation .
but it don' t cut slack here as far as i' m concerned .
swayzak sends you here , fine .
i gotta eat you .
those are rules .
i got nothin ' to say about that .
swayzak or no , you work for me now .
step outta line , make one false move , you' re outta here .
don' t think you' re the first .
let' s go .
where we goin ' ?
pest control .
# shadow , shadow #
hi , shadow .
hi , ronald .
how ya doin ' ?
stayin ' comfortable ?
i didn' t think you would make it .
i wouldn' t miss this .
who' s that ?
he works for me .
is he a fireman ?
i like firemen .
you like everybody , ronald .
brian mccaffrey .
yeah , sure .
no , that' s stephen .
he' s the little one with the hat .
oh , what a treat !
hey , do i know you ?
your dad did .
who the hell is this guy ?
nah , put it away .
come on , shadow .
he lost his dad to the animal and ... you didn' t even tell him who he was coming to see ?
tell him .
let me tell you about ronald .
ronald likes telephones .
likes to tape wooden matches to the bell strikers ... and then wrap it in cotton with gasoline .
had a whole little thing goin ' , huh ?
and when you got bored ?
what' d you do ?
he started makin ' calls .
never proved .
tell him about us down on state street .
nah .
nobody cares about that one .
it was your basic warehouse torch i was doin ' for the owner .
i mean , they were a cakewalk .
i just
i just lost my concentration and my animal turned on me .
got the whole place going like hell .
my hair was on fire , my hands , everything .
i was dead .
then suddenly i was alive .
i was pulled out of there ... by my hero , my shadow here .
except , he didn' t see this big tub of phosphorous , did you ?
explosion lit him up so bright , left his shadow on the wall .
still shy about rolling up your sleeves , shadow ?
show him your stomach .
the funny thing about firemen , night and day , they' re always firemen .
ronald bartel .
all right , the parole board has received ...
mr. bartel' s fitness report , his i. d. 44 , endorsement from his section warden .
dr. norris ?
as supervising psychiatrist , i would describe ...
mr. bartel' s progress as remarkable .
taking into account his disability and the six years ... he' s already served , i recommend a parole .
mr. bartel , do you regret your crimes ?
yes , and and i' m aware of the pain that i have caused .
if released , will you commit these crimes again ?
no .
no , i won' t .
do you consider yourself ready for society ?
yes , i do .
yeah , right , ronald .
you' re ready , all right .
excuse me .
excuse me .
shadow .
remember this ?
remember this , ronald ?
remember who it belonged to ?
mm hmm .
what did you do to that little girl ?
it' s not fair , shadow .
what did you do to that little girl ?
i burned her .
you burned her .
what do you do to old ladies , ronald ?
burn them .
and what about the world , ronald ?
what would you like to do with the whole world ?
burn it all .
see ya next year , ronald .
we figured the body' s the owner , some guy named cosgrove .
weird blast , though , like that other guy ... who went through the windshield of his own car .
explosion blew out the flame before the engine got here .
good for us ; not too good for him .
bring the toolbox .
tim , get the hot spots .
you in the cheap seats , watch it .
there' s brian .
well , let' s go .
hey , mccaffrey , need a special invitation ?
come on .
charge the line , axe .
what do you want me to do with this ?
shhh .
we got heavy smoke stains observed in entry room .
smoke demarcation line is very low .
fire never got hot enough here to cook the soot off .
come on , you sneaky little son of a bitch .
come on .
tell me where you came from .
point me where you started .
come on .
burn indicators distended toward northern wall .
less soot here , more heat .
lack of discoloration in shattered glass ... indicates slow burn before explosion .
there' s some little dead rat critters here .
fire originated in this room .
took its time .
hung out .
the air ran out .
it couldn' t breathe .
it was snuffed .
but it wasn' t dead .
must have been all that trapped heat lying low , waiting for some sucker to give it one big gulp of air .
another backdraft .
this is our point of origin .
let me have a crowbar .
no sign of accelerants .
well , if it' s arson , somebody figured a new way to hide it .
okay , we got alan seagrave ... and donald cosgrove .
both deaths due to close encounters ... with stationary objects .
we have an office door for cosgrove ... and , oh , an ' 87 porsche for seagrave .
no nonrelevant traumas .
no significant blood toxicology .
attitude of both trajectories are consistent with explosion .
they ran the residue you scraped from both front doors .
it' s a combination of plumber' s putty and rayophene gum .
it burns almost completely away when you light it .
so it was on both doors ?
yeah .
something else i want to show you .
you' re gonna have to help me .
mccaffrey , why don' t you come over and help us ?
no , i don' t think so .
not in my contract .
i just rewrote your contract .
come on over and help us .
anyway , here , we' re gonna have to lift him .
great .
christ , he' s not gonna sell you insurance .
just lift him up .
hold on .
you see that patch of shirt right there ?
we wondered about the discoloration .
so i scraped a piece off and ran a spectro on it .
on a lucky shot , we picked up traces of something .
what was it ?
ah , trychtichlorate .
nobody around here ever heard of it .
yeah , trychtichlorate .
it eats magnesium .
it' s an absorption catalyst used in toxic waste accidents .
it' s rare .
they stopped making it a couple of years ago .
we figured it got in his clothes in a gas state from the fire .
what was it doing in the fire ?
that' s your job .
okay !
stephen , what what are you doing here ?
just fixin ' my roof .
you' ve gotta stop just showing up on the roof like this .
look , i just i wanted to , i don' t know , not exactly ... apologize for the other night , especially since ...
i don' t remember much .
you remember .
yeah , i know .
i just wanted to say , i don' t know , something .
the great communicator .
so what' s going on , stephen ?
you only bang on the roof when you got something on your mind .
how' s brian doing ?
he' s out .
he quit .
he just up and quit for no reason ?
i don' t care what you heard , helen , i treated him better ... than any other probie i ever had .
all right ?
he probably hates my guts ... but at least he finally took a look in the mirror .
so once again , stephen' s right and somebody else is wrong .
you always gotta be right .
that' s such bullshit .
yeah ?
why ?
because i' m the first to admit it when i' m wrong .
yeah ?
how often does that happen ?
in a fire ?
never !
he would have bought it , helen .
i' m telling ya , maybe not today , maybe not next year ; but it would have happened .
all right ?
he' s my brother .
i couldn' t just
you just couldn' t live with that .
mccaffrey .
yeah ?
take the top off .
holy shit !
that' s it .
that' s it .
son of a bitch !
this guy is different .
he don' t love fire .
who ?
the killer .
he used magnesium to make it look like an accident .
i got it after we went to see ronald .
torchers want to fry the whole goddamn world .
but the fires that killed those guys never burned up that much .
the trychtichlorate hid the magnesium in the plug , but it burned slow .
and he made his burns backdrafts .
but he killed these guys .
could have killed everybody .
backdraft blew out the flame .
that' s it .
that' s the reason .
what reason ?
why backdrafts .
whoever fried seagrave and cosgrove ... went to a hell of a lot of trouble to make sure they died by fire .
they also made sure that the fire blew itself out .
so that' s why they used the putty in the doors .
what do we got ?
a torch with a conscience ?
no .
we got a stone killer trying to make a point .
you can make the call now .
it' s arson , right ?
i' m not calling anyone yet .
you can' t rush this .
i' ve seen it too many times before .
i wanna make sure this torch doesn' t walk .
we' re gonna wait .
well , well , mr. mccaffrey .
welcome aboard .
nice boat you got here .
what ?
you mean mine ?
well , not yet .
glad to have you as part of the team , brian .
let' s get a picture with mr. mccaffrey and myself .
you look good .
yeah , there you go .
thanks .
hi .
yeah , have fun now .
great night , isn' t it ?
who is that ?
larry dewaay .
come on .
larry , how are ya ?
hey .
yeah .
how' s the job going ?
okay .
yeah ? ls rimgale getting any better ?
rimgale' s rimgale .
he' s just doing his job .
doing his job ?
he hasn' t done anything .
at this rate , he won' t declare it' s arson before he retires .
will you get me out of here ?
otherwise i' m gonna have to go and pick her up .
this is it , one of the oldest fire stations in the city .
what do you think ?
it' s homey .
shhh !
the guys are sleeping upstairs .
you' re gonna get me in trouble .
this is my office .
impressive , huh ?
yes , it' s very nice .
lot of tradition locked up in this old house .
see those doors ?
they lead to the hay loft when they used to have the old horse drawn engines .
lot different then .
but kind of the same , you know ?
do you miss it ?
you seem like you do .
well , when i came back ,
i , uh i knew .
i knew that i really wanted to be a fireman .
then why' d you quit ?
i should have said i wanted to be a good one .
so show me your fire truck .
shhh !
mask up , lads .
bring that sledge .
where is it ?
i don' t know .
there' s alarms goin ' off on three floors .
this alarm system' s been screwing up since they built
10 ?
29 ?
yeah .
how do we know if the floor' s gonna be on fire ?
well , when the doors open , if it' s hot ,
don' t get out .
we' re gonna start on this side .
i' il meet you down at the end .
all right , come on .
come on .
high rise gigs give me the creeps .
bull , we' re early on this one again ... and it ain' t even broke out yet .
we' re one short with brian gone .
wait for the next in engines .
let' s catch it before it breaks out .
you want to learn something ?
yeah , i do .
axe , go with pengelly .
take the other side .
don' t split us up again .
it ain' t safe .
i haven' t got time for this .
then let me take the lead .
do your job ; they need a line .
come on .
come on , axe .
oh , you' re so very sly ; but , so am i.
she' s hot and smoky ... but she' s not rollin ' yet .
shit !
hello , 51 .
you follow 17 in the truck .
11201 south clark .
it' s a cancel .
11021 south clark .
south clark .
what time is it , anyway ?
all right , take it .
wait , wait .
make sure you check it first .
oh , yeah .
howdy , boys .
brian !
here we go .
now get that mask back on .
right .
clear !
stay here .
check that door for heat , tim ?
tim !
watch out , steve .
i got him .
move off .
put it out !
stretcher !
get the goddamn stretcher .
everybody over here .
through here .
through here .
get that stretcher over here .
what the hell happened ?
tim !
tim !
how' d it happen ?
breathe , tim , breathe .
get him in there !
come on !
you' re all right .
come on !
hang on , kid !
hey , shadow , i got one here .
oh , christ .
some guy named holcomb .
steve .
steve .
steve , you all right ?
how is he ?
he' s alive .
is he gonna make it ?
they' re not saying .
he' s in there .
i' m sorry .
you can' t come in now .
please stay outside .
i should have been there .
none of us should have been there , brian .
don' t tell me about the chance i' m taking .
you were costing me time .
you didn' t wait for back up .
you were wrong .
what the hell is your trouble ?
this part of your investigation ?
you had to do it .
you had to be myth man , taking another fire bare handed ...
instead of looking out for the probie .
we need space .
is that what happened ?
i had that fire .
he didn' t listen .
he' s a candidate , your responsibility .
you shouldn' t have had him up there in the first place .
you burned him , stephen .
fuck you .
don' t you walk away from me .
yo , brian .
let' s go .
goddamn it !
get him off !
come on !
easy , man .
loosen up !
you' re just making things worse .
relax .
forget about it .
come on .
come on .
inspector .
alderman .
chinese sponge cake ?
when are you gonna catch the prick that' s doing this , don ?
don ?
don' t you have any leads ?
no , marty , i don' t .
we haven' t found any connection between the victims at all .
jesus christ .
open your eyes .
you got seagrave , cosgrove ...
and now holcomb .
holcomb ?
put ' em together .
it' s a goddamn list .
i didn' t know the name of that victim had been released ?
hey , john .
morning .
i' il do whatever you want me to do .
i want to help you nail that son of a bitch that burned tim .
show me how .
thought old marty was acting a little strange .
he' s right .
there' s residue .
holcomb is the third victim .
the backdraft was set up somewhere in there .
fried holcomb when he opened the inner door .
but the outer door held and it waited for tim .
in a word , brian , what is this job all about ?
fire .
it' s a living thing , brian .
it breathes , it eats , and it hates .
the only way to beat it ... is to think like it ; to know this flame will spread this way across the door ... and up across the ceiling ; not because of the physics of flammable liquids , but because it wants to .
some guys , fire owns ' em .
makes ' em fight it on its level .
the only way to truly kill it ... is to love it a little , just like ronald .
hi .
hi .
i heard your friend' s gonna be okay .
thanks .
we checked and your boss was partners ... with all the murder victims in a company called lakeside dynamics .
he' s keeping that a secret .
i wanna know why .
i don' t know anything about that .
you might be able to find out .
get me his files .
do you know what you' re asking ?
yeah .
four years ago i was punching a cash register .
two years ago , marty swayzak didn' t even know my name .
i was bringing the guy coffee .
i practically run that office now .
and marty he believes in me .
i just don' t
you' re asking me to throw that all away .
your boss is a liar .
stephen ?
i' m sorry , helen .
i just couldn' t sleep .
well , what' s wrong ?
it used to be real clear .
when i was a kid , what meant most to me about this job was ... no " ifs .
somebody called the fire department , we came .
we just showed up .
those guys , they just don' t know how much i love ' em .
you don' t leave people hangin ' .
it holds everything up , doesn' t it ?
loyalty .
i don' t get it .
till death do us part . " isn' t that what you heard , helen ?
you go , we go .
it' s all the same ... piece of shit without that , isn' t it ?
it' s the end of everything .
i' m sorry i came .
there' s just nobody i can talk to .
i really miss you .
you sure you really want to put grape jelly in the eggs ?
yeah , it' s part of my formula .
it' s an experiment .
it' s an experiment ?
yeah .
let' s get these eggs going .
hey , i want to do that .
can you do it ?
that' s good .
i' il put that in the formula .
you gonna leave the shells ?
yeah .
they' re part of the formula ?
yeah .
i guess you know what you' re doing .
i know what i' m doing .
uh oh .
mom !
i didn' t know you' d be up so early .
mom , go back to bed .
we' re making you breakfast in bed .
stephen , can i talk to you a minute ?
yeah .
you keep going there .
you' re doing good .
he knows what he' s doin ' .
he told me he likes those piano lessons you got him taking .
it' s just i don' t want to confuse him , you know .
i knew who you were when we got married .
i knew how you did things .
and
i mean , you haven' t
i just can' t anymore .
i just you know ,
i gotta worry about sean .
yeah .
i mean , you' re the best .
you really are .
but the chances that you take just
you scare me now .
sean .
listen , i , uh
i blew it .
i forgot that i gotta work this morning .
so , um
that' s all right .
we' il just do it again next saturday .
all right ?
mom' s crying .
the latest polls came in , marty .
marty ?
jesus christ , marty .
what' s going on ?
we have a city planners meeting in 15 minutes .
marty .
you' ve gotta level with me , marty .
is there something about these deaths you' re not telling me ?
no .
what' s this ?
just take it .
rimgale' s gonna wanna talk to swayzak about this .
i' m sorry .
that' s a dumb thing to say .
you' re right .
good bye , brian .
what the hell you do with this thing ?
what do you mean ?
i drove it , joe .
this is a copy of swayzak' s report that we know is bullshit ; but we could never argue with the numbers because they' re airtight .
this file she gave you proves it' s phoney .
i checked on the firm that recommended the cuts to swayzak' s task force .
they' ve done exactly one job , a manpower study .
i checked further and it' s not even a company .
no employees ... nothing .
just a p. o. box .
i wonder who wrote that report .
someone who knows how to work numbers .
exactly .
like a bunch of dead financial wizards .
seagrave , holcomb , cosgrove  and swayzak .
why did he go through this trouble to cut firehouses ?
when a firehouse closes , swayzak converts it into a community center .
that' s sweet .
lakeside dynamics , remember them ?
they get all the expensive construction work .
i' m telling you , this is a total scam .
these guys were making a ton of money .
it' s time we had a little talk with mr. swayzak .
let' s go .
mr. swayzak ?
gas .
check in there .
aaah !
come on .
come on !
let' s go .
come on !
hey , kid .
i think i' ve got a problem here .
is it true that you were rescued by the fire department' s arson team ?
that' s quite a bunch of guys , huh ?
i' m so goddamn helpless here .
i can' t do a fucking thing .
what do you want me to do ?
i' ve been lying here thinkin ' .
for hours ... thinkin ' and thinkin ' and thinkin ' .
we' re close .
we' re close .
but we' re not lookin ' in the right place , not in the right place .
so , you' ve come to pick ronald' s brains ... because nobody knows the animal like ronald .
it must' ve looked like it was going to be ... a medium deal , didn' t it , when your father bought it ?
what ?
did you watch him when he made that ballsy jump and saved
i didn' t come to talk about my father .
i sent away for a copy of that " life magazine " ... with your picture on the cover .
it' s a collectible .
who' s doing this , ronald ?
wrong question .
who isn' t ?
it isn' t a spark , is it ?
because there isn' t enough damage ... and he wouldn' t have had any fun .
it isn' t an insurance pro because there isn' t any profit .
who does that leave us with ?
what' s his tool ?
how does he do it ?
how does he talk to the fire ?
the outlets .
no .
that' s a probie .
that' s beneath you , brian .
trychtichlorate .
very good .
very good .
you still haven' t put it together ?
i have .
then who , ronald ?
you wanna know who ?
i wanna know ... if this kid really wanted to be ... just like his dad .
did he ?
okay .
i' m outta here .
all right !
i wanted to be him , okay ?
i wanted to be him more than anything .
you loved him .
yeah .
you watched him dance with the animal .
you saw your dad burn .
fuck you , ronald !
who the hell' s doin ' this ?
did it look at you ?
did the fire look at you ?
it did .
ohhh .
our worlds aren' t that far apart , are they ?
so ... whoever did this , really knows the animal well , don' t they ?
they know him real well but they won' t let him loose .
they won' t let him have fun so they don' t love him .
who doesn' t love fire ... and is around trychtichlorate all day long ?
oh , my god !
that wasn' t such a long walk after all , was it ?
oh , god .
goddamn it , stephen .
hey , what' s goin ' on ?
i just came by to see how you were doing ?
how am i doin ' ?
well , i' m sellin ' dad' s boat .
guy comin ' by in a few minutes to take a look at it .
what are you gonna do ?
i mean , where you going ?
i didn' t say i was goin ' anywhere .
look , i gotta i gotta get back .
there' s somethin ' i' m supposed to do .
what ?
what do you gotta do ?
look at you .
look at your face !
all the things you must be thinkin ' .
you really hate my guts , don' t you ?
you know something , brian ?
that' s all right .
maybe we should talk abou  you don' t like me ... because i was no genius in the way i raised you .
is that it ?
dad was gone !
what was i supposed to do ?
you tell me .
forget it .
it' s okay .
i tried .
i wanted so many things for you ... that i couldn' t even hope for .
because after that , i had no choices !
well , i' m not your father .
you got somewhere to go , go .
people change , huh , brian ?
sometimes right when you' re lookin ' at ' em .
what' s going on with you ?
i don' t know .
do you ?
i gotta go .
roaring fire ]
attention , all units responding .
this is gonna be a hazardous materials response at a chemical plant .
stephen ?

he just pulled up .

i' m tryin ' to explain .
stephen .

axe .
somebody had to stop these pricks .
are you thinkin ' ?
you burned people !
you didn' t see .
you' re a fireman .

those assholes were closin ' firehouses , gettin ' our friends killed for money .
i had to do it for the department !
for tim ?
that was an accident .
did you start that fire ?
why' d you have to go in there so fucking early ?
that' s why you wanted me to wait .
let me finish swayzak !
no .
it' s over .
your dad would puke if he saw how you shit on his department .
what would he say about what you do ?
your dad died ... saving my life , and these people were killin ' firemen for money .
swayzak .
he killed our friends for money .
what the fuck would you do ?
you' re his lieutenant .
you' ve gotta handle this .

# you sit there with a blank expression #
# say you can' t go on anymore #
# it' s not like me to come out and help you #
# maybe i' ve been down this road before #
# been livin ' in the shadows #
# now you come out slow #
# now you' re in the saddle #
# got to ride alone #
# now the dream is shattered #
# those days are few #
# maybe something mattered #
# it' s not just for you #
# some are gonna go for broke #
# some will lay down #
# i' ve been too long standing still #
# all i know is whenever you need me #
# you reach out and set me in motion #
# lookin ' out on that lonely valley #
# you' re tellin ' me i' ve come so far #
# you' re the reason i finally got there #
# you' re the reason it' s been so hard #
# been livin ' in the shadows #
# now you hear the call #
# now you' re in the saddle #
# you got to ride or fall #
# now you push a little harder #
# like i showed you to #
# ' cause the day' il be comin ' they will look to you #
# some are gonna go for broke #
# some will lay down #
# i' ve been too long standing still #
# all i know is whenever you need me #
# you reach out and set me in motion #
# some are gonna go for broke #
# some will lay down #
# i' ve been too long standing still #
# all i know is whenever you need me #
# you reach out and set me in motion #
# some are gonna go for broke #
# some will lay down #
# i' ve been too long standing still #
# i will pick you up whenever you stumble #
# you reach out and set me in motion #
