the deadliest weapon in the world ... ... is a marine , and his rifle .
it is your killer instinct that must be harnessed ... ... if you expect to survive in combat .
your rifle ... ... is only a tool .
it is a hard heart that kills .
if your killer instincts are not clean and strong ... ... you will hesitate at the moment of truth .
you will not kill .
you will become dead marines .
and then you will be in a world of shit .
because marines are not allowed ... ... to die without permission !

private pyle ... ... has dishonored himself and dishonored the platoon !

that' s a negative .
let' s keep it short and sweet .
anybody got anything new ?
rumor has it that the tet ceasefire will be cancelled .
rear echelon paranoia .
intelligence says charlie might try something big during tet .
they say the same thing every year .
there' s a lot of talk about it .
don' t lose any sleep over it .
the tet holiday is like july fourth , christmas and new year in one .
every zipperhead in the north and south , will bang gongs ... ... and bark at the moon .
ann margret and entourage are due next week .
i want someone to stick with her for a few days .
rafterman , you take it .

don' t be obvious , but i want to see fur and early morning dew .
diplomats in dungarees .
marine engineers rebuild dong phuc villages ....
chili , if we move vietnamese , they are evacuees .
if they come to us to be evacuated , they are refugees .
i' il make a note of it , sir .
n. v. a. soldier deserts after reading pamphlets .
an n. v. a. regular , who realized his side would lose ...
... deserted after reading open arms pamphlets .
that' s good , dave .
but why say , " n. v. a. regular " ?
is there an irregular ?
how about n. v. a. soldier ?
i' il fix it .
the lawrence welk show " will be on tv in two weeks .
dave , do 100 words on it .
not while we' re eating .
n. v. a. learned not to interrupt meals of marines on a search and destroy mission .
we have a new directive from m. a. f. on search and destroy .
substitute " sweep and clear " in place of " search and destroy .
got it ?
got it .
very catchy .
and , joker , where' s the weenie ?
the kill .
the grunts must have hit something .
didn' t see them .
i' ve told you , we run two basic stories here .
winning of hearts and minds .
winning the war .
you must have seen blood trails , drag marks ?
it was raining , sir .
that' s why god passed the law of probability .
rewrite it with a happy ending , say , one kill .
a sapper or an officer .
which ?
whichever you say .
grunts like reading about dead officers .
okay , an officer .
how about a general ?
you' d like our guys to read the paper and feel bad ?
in case you didn' t know , this is not a popular war .
our job is to report the news that the ... ... " why are we here " civilian newsmen ignore .
maybe you should go out on some ops yourself .
you could find more blood trails and drag marks .

can' t say i liked it much .

sometimes he thinks he' s john wayne .
you listen to joker .
he knows ti ti .
