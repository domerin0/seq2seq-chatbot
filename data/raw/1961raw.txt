i can play 24 years old , and i' il damn well prove it .
you wanna quit the show ?

you don' t have to do anything for me .
just don' t kid yourself that you' re doing this show for any reason except guilt about me .
guilt ?
what guilt ?
for never going one day when you were faithful to me ?
oh , that guilt .
faithful , faithful ...
you' re always talking about being faithful .
audrey , why do you think so small ?
besides , how do i know you were faithful to me ?
you know i was .
that' s right , i know you were .
oh , you meant to do that .
yes , i did .
you kept me working all the time .
i never had a chance to cheat .
what is this big hang up about fidelity ?
what makes being faithful the greatest friggin ' virtue in the world ?
excuse me .

those stacys , those victorias ...
you' re not even fooling michelle with victoria , you know .
straighten that leg .
it is as straight as it' s ever going to get .
oh , the bonnies , the wendys , the debbies , the donnas ...

death is in ,
books , magazine articles , tvshows , ken and barbie dolls with a mutual suicide pact .. ,
buried them in a little shoebox ,
knew a guy who bought a pair of them , he was into doll necrophilia .
if it cuts .. ,

oooh !
it' s terrific .
there' s a lady in chicago , man , wrote a book .
dr kubler ross , with a dash ,
this chick , man , without the benefit of dying herself has broken the process of death into five stages ,
anger , denial , bargaining , depression and acceptance ,
