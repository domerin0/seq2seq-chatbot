of course .
can i see your face ?
sure .
do you like what you see ?
yeah , i do .
how much ?
how much do you usually pay ?
it' s my first time ...
how about 200, 000 won ?
great .
we' il decide on the spot .
you' re not a cop , right ?
if you' re not , then we' re not either .
there was a prostitute in india named vasumitra .
vasumitra ?
what a pretty name .
words say that any man who slept with her , turned into a devoted buddhist .
what the hell did she do to them ?
she gave a ecstatic sex as a prostitute , i guess .
what does sex have to do with buddihsts ?
maybe it aroused some deep maternal love .
you see , men are like babies when they have sex .
yeo jin , call me vasumitra from now on .
close your mouth .
got it ?
i' m vasumitra from today on .
isn' t that him ?
look out for me .
yeo jin !
how can you laugh ?
' cause it' s fun .
stop right there !
he stopped chasing us .
wanna eat some pig' s feet ?
pig' s feet ?
the money ?
how much do we have now ?
a little more than one person' s airfare .
i guess i' il have to meet ten more .
hey , that' s dirty .
come on , i was eating it .
that guy ...
do you know his occupation ?
who cares .
have you heard of sensors ?
sensors ?
you' ve seen those glass doors open when you approach them .
they are all sensor operated .
he says he runs a shop that sells those sensors .
he said sensors had another use .
what was it again ?
stop talking nonsense .
what' s the use knowing what those beasts do ?
tell me !
why are you getting mad ?
i' m just curious about what they do .
even though it' s brief , we' re still sharing something .
it' s too dreary if there' s only sex .
you vasumitra idiot .
come here .
i' m not dirty .
it' s filthy .
you don' t know anything about those guys .
i' m sorry i pulled you into this .
let' s stop .
i' m scared that this would haunt me forever .
it' s not even a murder .
it' s not that hard on me .
there is some fun too .
and we need more money to buy two tickets to europe .
let' s be patient .
you seem like you' re enjoying it .
yeo jin , eat before you go to school .
you have a test today .
i don' t wanna take the test .
i won' t take it .
let' s eat .
do you know that today' s your mom' s memorial ?
did you get the suspect ?
i' m still investigating .
at the notre dame cathedral in avignon , france .
there' s a wooden statue of jesus christ .
the wood is so old and rotted , you can' t recognize the face .
even one of his arms is gone .
are you with me ?
yes .
then suddenly one day a bud sprouted from the wood .
but it has no roots ...
it' s so mysterious , isn' t it ?
the quarry in misari ?
at two ?
okay .
see you there .
did you set it up ?
yeah
misari at two .
let' s go .
don' t they say that your voice is different ?
nope .
i feel strange .
it' s not like i' m the one doing it , but i call and handle the money .
i was supposed to do your makeup at the beginning .
why do you have me do everything ?
i' m sorry .
i can' t do anything without you .
no , you' re the one who is suffering .
don' t ask about their occupations from now on .
okay .
yeo jin , get in .
he' s gonna buy us dinner .
today' s my mom' s memorial .
you don' t have a mom ?
if you' re done , then go .
get out !
get out now !
what' s wrong , yeo jin ?
get out now !
what' s with you ?
am i filthy to you ?
i said if you' re done , then go .
you think i' m filthy .
don' t you ?
i' m filthy , huh ?
what are you looking at ?
you want me , too ?
crazy bastard .
yeo jin , what' s with you ?
he' s a good guy .
he' s a musician .
what' s with you ?
what' s wrong with him buying us dinner ?
how could you eat with him after what he' s done to you ?
what has he done to me ?
they' re all filthy bastards !

i' m the one who was with him .
he' s such a good guy .
he even sang for me .
there was more than just sex .
damn you .
i' m sorry .
i' m sorry .
i must' ve done something wrong again .
he just makes me comfortable .

i' m sorry .
i won' t hurt your feelings again .
i won' t ask about their occupations either .
i' il just ...
i' il just ...
i' il just have sex .
i' m sorry .
it pisses me off that any guy can touch this beautiful thing .
he' s not ' any guy ' .
do you like that guy ?
be honest .
i could tell from your eyes .
how could you get those feelings in less than an hour ?
time isn' t important .
