zini , get your head down .
walkin ' backwards , huh ?
well , let me know if that gets you there any faster .
keep those little legs movin ' url , or you' il get left behind .
look at all the aladars .
if you' re even thinking of joining them
hang on !
hang on !
kron , there is a more protected spot further down the
we' il rest here for the night .
go ahead , bruton .
oh , eema , i wish we were at your nesting grounds now .
all this pushing and shoving about , just for a place to sleep .
i' m not used to this kind of behavior .
baylene , you got big feet .
just give ' em a kick .
git !
ooh , i couldn' t possibly .
shoo , shoo .
will you come on , baylene ?
you wanna get to the nesting grounds alive ?
show some backbone .
hey , there .
oh , sorry about that .
uh , it' s just , we overheard you talking , and , um
well , my word .
look at url .
he doesn' t normally warm up to strangers so fast .
what an unfortunate blemish .
good mud bath' d clear those right up .
excuse me ?
um , he' s my grandfather , couple of times removed .
try a couple of species removed .
uh , my name' s aladar .
this is my family .
we' re ... all that' s left .
oh , my dear .
i' m so sorry .
baylene' s the last of her kind .
finding stragglers like her all along the way .
i heard you say something about ... nesting grounds ?
it is the most beautiful place there is , child .
it' s where the herd goes to have their babies .
will we find anybody that looks ... like us there ?
oh , the last few days , i' ve seen ' em all shapes and sizes .
who knows what we' il find .
the hard job now is just getting there .
and we' re being driven unmercifully .
by who ?
kron , the herd' s head honcho .
we can hardly keep up .
an older woman like myself
it' s well , it' s positively indecent .
then tell him .
what' s the worst he can do ?
oh !
hey !
what' s his problem ?
that' s him , honey .
kron .
huh .
uh , excuse me !
kron , got a second ?
get lost , kid .
hmm .
relax , bruton .
who are you ?
uh , aladar .
why aren' t you uphill with the uh , young bloods ?
well , i was back here talking to these guys .
i guess they they' re having a hard time keeping up .
so , you know , maybe you could slow it down a bit ?
hmm .
let the weak set the pace .
now , there' s an idea .
better let me do the thinking from now on , aladar .
hey , they need help back here .
hmm .
watch yourself , boy .
don' t worry .
that' s how my brother treats newcomers , no matter how charming they are .
you sure know how to catch a girl' s eye , there , stud .
i wouldn' t be catchin ' nobody' s eye if i was you , especially neera' s .
you just keep your head down , and you mind what kron tells you .
since when do we take orders from the likes of him ?
kron has swatted flies bigger than you , pops .
i could hold that monster' s brain in the palm of my
no , yar , she' s right .
better to keep our heads down with this bunch ...
than get ' em bitten off by ... those things .
well , you just consider yourself lucky that' s all that' s following us .
hey , wake up .
enough with the beauty sleep .
you' re ravishing already .
hey !
hello !
anybody in there ?
zini , what are you doing ?
i believe you left a wake up call for the dawn of time .
come on !
move it !
what' s the hurry ?
something' s up .
the herd' s gathering without us .
let' s check it out .
rise and shine !
kron says everybody goes .
come on .
get up .
on your feet .
huh .
the charm never stops around here .
you say something ?
uh , no no , sir .
unless you got a death wish , you and that little parasite better get moving !
sheesh , is that guy ugly or what ?
hey , hey , hey , there' s your girlfriend .
what are you talkin ' about ?
neera .
scaly skin .
yellow eyes .
big ankles .
yeah , i made a real impression on her .
what you need is a little help from the love monkey .
" the love monkey " ?
ow , baby !
ow !
that , children , is what' s known as a " jerkasaurus " .
and with that , the ice is broken .
we' ve got a lot of first timers here .
make sure they get it .
we stop for nothing and no one .
if this is your first crossing , listen up .
there is no water till we reach the other side .
and you' d better keep up , ' cause if a predator catches you , you' re on your own .
move out !
oh , my goodness .
it looks like a very long walk .
and hot .
if you smell somethin ' sizzlin ' , it could be me .
we' re moving too slow .
i' il pick up the pace .
hey , old girl , you' re wandering off a bit .
that' s all i need : a monkey on my back .
on your feet , eema .
we can' t let those things eat you .
they' re out there waiting .
the lake !
we made it ?
it' s just over that that hill , baby .
oh , thank goodness .
come on , eema .
water .
remember water ?
oh , it' s time to refresh my memory .
i' m just gonna walk right into that lake ... until the water' s up to my eyeballs ... and soak it all in .
maybe the rains collected somewhere else .
what do you want us to do ?
take a scout and check the entire perimeter .
enough !
you have to be strong now .
the nesting grounds are only a few days away .
keep moving !
kron , we' ve never gone this long without water .
if we keep going like this , we' il lose half the herd .
then we save the half that deserves to live .
what ?
they' re moving already ?
oh ho , we' il never keep up .
there was water here , always water here before .
we always had water , always .
and and plenty of mud .
oh , eema , please .
the herd won' t wait .
we must carry on .
you gotta get up .
there was water everywhere .
there is no water , dear .
baylene , don' t move .
oh , what is it ?
what' s wrong ?
do you hear that ?
i sure do .
lift your foot , baylene .
now press down .
i always did like big girls !
water !
oh , my goodness !
water !
come on !
he found water .
that' s it , eema .
come drink .
kron , look .
all we had to do is dig , and
good .
now , get out of the way .
wait !
wait !
there' s enough for everyone !
oh .
eema !
that' s it .
keep pushing and shoving .
that' s very helpful .
bruton , we' ve been walking in circles .
there' s no water here .
i think we should get back .
shh .
keep it down .
let' s get out of here .
now , you come out on three .
one , two , three !
come on .
come on out .
no one' s gonna hurt you .
hey , hey .
what' s going on ?
the little aladars haven' t had anything to drink .
i think they' re scared of me .
who wouldn' t be ?
you are pretty scary .
come on over , guys .
take it easy .
don' t worry .
she' s just a hair ball .
and proud of it .
come on .
he' s gonna find you some water .
here .
now , you just take a foot and press .
he hey .
come on .
come on .
knock it off .
let' s let' s work together here , huh ?
a little teamwork .
ready ?
one , two , three .
press !
good job , suri .
so , where are your parents , anyway ?
a lot of us are on our own now .
you like kids , i see .
well , the skinny ones can be a little chewy .
i' m aladar , the ... " jerkasaurus " .
ohh .
sorry , about that .
probably right .
dad , wake up .
huh ?
why did you help that old one ?
what else could we do ?
leave her behind ?
oh .
you mean , you actually
well , that happens all the time .
you don' t survive if you' re not  strong enough .
well ... yeah .
is that you talking , or your brother ?
everything' s so different .
i i don' t know what to think anymore .
look , neera we watch out for each other , we all stand a chance of getting to your nesting grounds .
you sound so sure .
i' m not , but it' s all i know .
so , um oh , water .
i' il , uh , get you some water .
can i try it ?
sure .
just ... press .
sorry .
no .
you you first .
one down ... and , well , one down .
kron !
carnotaurs !
what ?
they never come this far north .
the fireball must' ve driven them out .
you led them right to us !
maybe you can feed them with your hide !
move the herd out , double time !
what' s happening ?
my brother' s moving the herd .
kron , what' s going on ?
carnotaurs .
if we don' t keep moving , they' il catch up to us .
but ... the others in the back they' il never make it .
they' il slow down the predators .
you can' t sacrifice them like this !
hold it !
that could be you back there !
or you !
if you ever interfere again ,
i' il kill you .
stay away from him !
aladar , no .
you just just go .
i' il be okay .
let' s go !
let' s go !
carnotaurs !
carno what ?
carnotaur .
a mouthful of teeth with a bad attitude .
let' s go .
come on , you guys !
get on !
get on !
we' re gonna get left behind .
let' s go !
hurry up !
we' re losing them !
aladar , slow down .
oh , joy .
blisters .
i' ve got blisters on my blisters .
you don' t wanna know where i got blisters .
what was that ?
it came from up ahead .
okay , what' s the worst thing it could be ?
a carnotaur .
okay , what' s the second worst thing it could be ?
two carnotaurs !
oh !
that' s it .
i' m gone .
oh , my goodness !
everybody , we don' t know for sure .
it could be the herd .
let' s check it out .
oh , my goodness .
goodness gracious .
oh , it' s bruton .
it appears we weren' t the only ones left behind .
what happened ?
carnotaurs .
oh , we should keep moving .
we can' t just leave him here .
we can if we move fast enough .
hey , you don' t look so good .
let me help you .
save your pity .
i just need some rest .
now , get away from me .
suit yourself .
change your mind , we' il be in those caves .
it' s dark , but at least it' s dry .
i like dry .
it' s the dark part i' m having trouble with .
ouch !
ooh .
sorry , url .
sturdy little thing , ain' t he ?
ahem .
we appear to have a visitor .
you coming in , or what ?
what is it with you ?
at least i know enough to get in out of the rain .
now , come on .
on your feet .
uh , you can lie down with us .
it' s warmer .
may i remind you that he' s one of them ?
well , looks like he' s one of us now .
ahh .
who booked this trip , anyway ?
ah , you' il be at the nesting grounds soon enough .
well , when i get there , i' m gonna give kron a piece of my mind .
you tell him , eema .
if i could sleep that deep , i' d be in paradise .
if you could sleep that deep , honey , you' d be dead .
this plant grew on our island .
it will make you feel better .
why is he doing this ?
pushing them on with false hope ?
it' s hope that' s gotten us this far .
but why doesn' t he let them accept their fate ?
i have accepted mine .
and what is your fate ?
to die here .
it' s the way things are .
only if you give up , bruton .
it' s your choice , not your fate .
well , the plant will help .
carnotaurs .
what do we do ?
wake the others .
go !
go !
hurry !
move it , eema !
aladar !
aladar !
oh , no !
i' il hold them off ! .
you help the others !
bruton !
bruton !
no !
bruton !
you did what you could .
it' s okay , little ones .
we' re going to make it .
okay , okay .
let' s do it again .
let' s do it again .
uh , i spy with my little eye  a rock .
you got it again !
ooh !
you are good !
well , i' il tell you what i spy .
a dead end .
what do we do now ?
i guess we just go back .
hold on a moment .
zini , what is it ?
do you smell that ?
yeah .
get a load of that .
good show .
everybody stand back .
we' re outta here !
aladar , look out !
no !
aladar , we' il go back .
back to what ?
it' s gone .
we' re not meant to survive .
oh , yes , we were .
we' re here , aren' t we ?
and how dare you waste that good fortune by simply giving up ?
shame on you .
shame on you !
shame on you !
the worst of it is , you allowed an old fool like me to believe i was needed that i still had a purpose and do you know what ?
you were right .
and i' m going to go on believing it .
and i , for one , am not willing to die here .
oh , dear .
the nesting grounds .
it' s it' s untouched .
our new home .
and it comes with a pool !
yodelay yodelay yodelayheehoo
cannonball !
whoo hoo ha ha !

amateur .
look out below !
not bad .
but i don' t get it .
where' s the herd ?
not to mention neera .
they' il get here
soon enough .
oh , no .
eema ?
i spoke too soon .
what is it ?
that is the way we used to get in here .
they' il never make it over that .
aladar , wait !
wait !
kron' il eat you alive .
let him try .
mm .
i hope kron' s in a listening mood .
stay here .
we' il find a way around it .
in the morning , we' il climb it .
we have to keep trying .
our survival , our future , is over these rocks .
now , let' s go home !
you' il make it , won' t you , boys ?
no .
watch them .
they' re tough !
if they can do it , so can you !
kron !
get the herd out of here !
a carnotaur is coming !
keep moving !
stop !
i' ve been to the valley !
there' s a safer way !
go on !
show ' em !
kron , listen to him .
look , we gotta go now !
go where , straight to the carnotaurs ?
if we hurry , we can get around them !
you can' t get over those rocks !
there' s a sheer drop on the other side !
you' re gonna kill the herd !
i know a way to the valley , and everybody can make it !
now , follow me !
kron !
they' re staying with me !
all right .
let' s go !
neera !
he' s led that monster right to us !
this way !
no !
don' t move !
if we scatter , he' il pick us off ! .
stand together !
kron !
no .
kron .
welcome home .
move over , everybody .
bringing in babies is what i do best .
i' d say it' s been a few years since you' ve hatched an egg .
you' re right , so let me practice on your head .
look !
somebody wants to meet you .
ohh !
aren' t you the sweetest little small fry i ever did see ?
hey , little guy .
he looks just like me .
meet your dad .
he' s not as crazy as he looks .
ohh .
oh , happy day .
well done , little one .
come here , you little rascal .
let me get a good look at you .
yep .
you' re your father' s son , all right .
hey !
look what i found !
new neighbors !
any of you ladies up for a game of " monkey in the middle " ?
easy , now !
easy !
hey !
none of us really know what changes , big or small , lie ahead .
one thing is certain our journey' s not over .
we can only hope that , in some small way ... our time here will be remembered .
