when i was born , the world was a far simpler place .
it was all just cops and robbers .
fucking get down !
get down now !
and you !
stay down !
stay down !
but it wasn' t for me .
then came the summer of love .
hashish and lsd arrived on the scene .
there were villains locked away for 12 years for robbing a bank of 10 grand , doing time with drippy hippies doing 12 months for smuggling two million quid' s worth of puff .
i mean , work it out , mate .
we' re in the wrong fucking game .
drugs changed everything .
always remember that one day all this drug monkey business will be legal .
not millions , fucking billions .
recreational drugs plc .
giving people what they want .
good times today , stupor tomorrow .
but this is now .
so , until prohibition ends , make hay while the sun shines .
i' m not against it .
i' m a businessman whose commodity happens to be cocaine .
ten years ago , charlie was for pop stars or a celebrity' s birthday bash .
it was demonised by daily mail readers getting drunk in naff wine bars .
now they' re my biggest clients .
this is clarkie .
double first at cambridge in industrial chemistry .
well , he' s got to pay off his student loan somehow .
today , i only deal in kilos .
depending which tariff you use , that' il cost you either 28 grand or 15 years in prison , which is more time than a rapist .
c' est la vie .
it is vital that we work to a few golden rules .
always work in a small team .
keep a very low profile .
only deal with people who come recommended .
washing machines , hand made shoes , blow jobs .
as long as you don' t take the piss , people will always come back for more .
that' s not to say we don' t weave that magic that makes two kilos into three , but never be too greedy .
know and respect your enemy .
it is only very , very stupid people who think the law is stupid .
and avoid like the fucking plague
loud , attention seeking wannabe gangsters , in it for the glory , to be a face , to be a name .
hello , slavo .
yeah , this is duke .
everything' s sweet .
when can we meet ?
they don' t mean to fuck up .
they just do .
forgive me for stating the obvious , but stay away from the end user .
they are guaranteed to bring you trouble .
as do guns .
i hate guns .
and violence .
but as some roman general once said ,
if you seek peace , plan for war .
morty and his assistant terry , they watch my back .
morty learnt caution the hard way .
he did ten years inside .
he' s my bridge to the criminal world , and he ensures that the traffic is one way .
look , there' s amsterdam , and there' s oofdorfe ... dorfe .
not a fucking clue .
none of them speak english .
get in the car .
i' m sure it' s that way .
move up .
i bet you it' s that way .
we' ve already been that way .
yeah , but we' re gonna go that way again .
give us the map .
oh , don' t start , the pair of you .
it' s like being out with a pair of kids .
all day you' ve been moaning .
it can' t be that difficult .
how many fucking greenhouses can there be ?
morty .
terence .
clarkie .
pay your supplier prompt .
in our case , that' s mr jimmy price .
he' s the top of the pyramid .
pay him .
in full , on time , without fail , no short counts .
you get no second chances .
jimmy calls the shots .
where the fuck is gene ?
i don' t know .
ask me one on sport .
what time does your watch tell ?
the same as yours .
he' s never late .
shut the fuck up .
patience .
gene here is jimmy' s right hand man .
been with him since way back .
all the drugs and cash go through gene .
jimmy trusts him with his life .
by the way , jimmy would like to see you tomorrow for a spot of lunch .
wait a minute .
is there a problem ?
why does everybody assume there' s a problem , just because he wants a word ?
maybe he' s grateful .
he fucking should be .
see you at stoke park at one .
this is just so beautiful .
we need to get in and out of here sharpish .
paul and the tide ain' t gonna wait .
everyone likes to walk through a door marked " private " .
therefore , have a good reason to be affluent .
i own a share in a very successful letting agency .
it gives me an honest income .
looks good on the self assessment .
whereas years ago scallywags were trying to get money out of banks , now your problem is how to get your ill gotten gains in .
that' s a job for mr singh .
he does my laundry .
and in a week , it will be ready for collection , in the form of a nice , clean cheque for a round million .
the business is on the up and up .
but i' ve always said , have a plan and stick to it .
quit while you' re ahead .
so barring any fuck ups , i' m leaving it all behind .
no , we got the parcel .
yeah , better than expected , actually .
it' s just that things have gone a little bit slightly turbo this end .
come on , boys , lively , lively .
if we miss this tide , we' re not going anywhere till daylight .
paul , you ain' t being paid to moan .
you' re being paid to get my cargo home .
come on , babe .
you all right ?
careful here , it' s a bit wobbly .
life is so fucking good , i can taste it in my spit .
i' il treat tomorrow' s lunch like a last supper , feign interest in his tales .
and then leave quietly forever .
this is pure class .
please , follow me , gentlemen .
mr price is in the oval room .
your guests , mr price .
thanks , angelo .
welcome .
sit down .
how is it with that paki accountant i put your way ?
he still doing the business ?
raj is doing a very good job .
good .
paying your bit of straight goer' s tax , eh ?
we all have to do our bit .
say hello from me next time you see him .
you hungry ?
the grub here will make your bollocks tingle .
let' s eat .
right .
we' ve gotta test the snap crackle and pop factor on these babies .
don' t ask me .
i ain' t fucking touching ' em .
you are a miserable bastard , you really are .
brian .
what ?
sit down , mate .
got a little treat for you .
help yourself .
a little privacy , please , angelo .
what do you want , son ?
excuse me ?
in life .
what are you after ?
a shot at the title ?
a seat by the band ?
well , i don' t know , mr price .
that' s a very expansive question .
right , expansive .
good answer .
years ago , people would' ve thought you were a homosexual , using a word like " expansive " .
you' re not a homosexual , are you ?
no .
not behind with the rent ?
no .
no , i didn' t think you were .
no harm in it , i suppose .
times change .
you know why people like you can' t leave this business ?
because you make too much money for people like me .
anyway , i' il get to the point .
i need a favour .
i need someone who' s a bit cute , a smooth operator .
not a two a penny loud mouth .
too many grasses around .
it would be a pleasure , mr price .
jimmy .
you can call me jimmy .
now , this favour .
it' s not for me , truth be told .
it' s for a good friend of mine .
like a blood brother .
we were at school together .
now he' s a right wheeler dealer .
flinging up skyscrapers .
his wife' s a proper blue blood .
i' il give you a clue .
eddie temple .
does that name mean anything to you ?
i know who you mean .
now , eddie' s got a daughter .
charlie , bless her .
the light of his life .
he worships the ground she walks on .
she' s a proper beauty , charlie .
or to give her her correct moniker , charlie spencer temple .
but she ain' t behaving like a lady .
she' s hooked on the white powder and loves a wrong ' un .
this is where you come in , right ?
you' re gonna find her .
find her ?
she' s gone missing .
well , you should get a private detective .
oh , right .
some nosy ex policeman , still on the scotland yard payroll ?
she' s done a runner from a drug rehabilitation unit in the west country .
rehab .
she got loved up in there with some fucking low life crackhead called kinky .
i reckon they' ve gone back to london .
i wouldn' t know where to begin .
now and then we' re asked to do something beyond the call of duty .
it' s called sacrifice , son .
ask gene .
ask morty .
i' il do my best .
you do your best and find her .
keep mr mcguire posted .
i' ve also got a little business more in your usual line .
gene' il fill you in .
everything was to your satisfaction ?
fucking excellent , angelo .
thank you .
details , details .
things to do , things to get done .
don' t bother me with details .
just tell me when they' re done .
who said that , son ?
winston churchill ?
close .
no , i said it .
james lionel price .
good boy .
i' il see you at the yard tomorrow .
say , four .
tell you about that bit of business .
i' ve set up a meet for five with the duke .
what' s with him ?
he' s just had one of these .
these are super es .
we' il make millions !
i don' t care .
this is my boat yard .
i want those pills and that fucking idiot out of here now .
i can' t afford to get nicked .
paul .
calm down , mate .
i' ve got gene coming down with a buyer .
you' il be in your whack .
here , chill .
have a pill .
gene , why are we doing business with the duke ?
yeah , why are we dealing with this joker ?
he' s a fucking maniac , a relic , a throw back , belongs to the dark ages .
will you just shut the fuck up ?
we' re dealing with him because he has 1 million ecstasy pills of very high levels of mdma , ok ?
one million ?
gene , that is a lot of pills .
what' s the tax on that ?
love a bit of cloak and dagger , this lot .
oh , yeah .
driving a bright yellow range rover .
very subtle .
calm down .
you' il feel better once you' ve got your money .
but how much can you spend in parkhurst or the scrubs , gene ?
come on .
oh , don' t go getting duke at it .
jimmy doesn' t want him fucked about , ok ?
who ?
me ?
don' t you fucking talk to me like i' m some kind of mug .
duke , don' t take this personally .
it' s business .
you want to know how much they' re worth .
yes !
fucking !
please !
just because you pay a fiver a pop down the local cattle market , don' t , for fuck' s sake , think these pills are worth millions .
they' re not .
we' ve got to find a buyer .
they' ve got to split them into parcels .
they' ve got to find these people .
you' d give a fucking aspirin a headache , pal .
then you' ve got currency fluctuations , police activity , adverse publicity .
who has got the readies lying around to pay for a million es ?
this is fucking bollocks !
slasher , shut the fuck up !
duke , we all want a good deal .
mate , mate , mate .
mate , look , that parcel of pills has got to be worth five million easy . 5 each , yeah !
you are fucking joking .
it doesn' t work like that !
don' t keep fucking saying that to me !
i' ve got some samples .
i' il stay in touch through gene , ok ?
you wouldn' t be so fucking flash if you didn' t have him behind you .
yeah , well , he fucking has , ain' t he ?
where did these monkeys get a million es ?
don' t worry about that .
can you place them ?
we know someone up north who' il buy .
morty , set up a meeting with trevor and shanks in liverpool .
what' s really bothering me is what colour to get the aston .
as you' re driving it yourself , probably green .
green ?
yeah .
that' s a trifle dull , i thought .
what do you think , girls ?
black .
yeah , black .
black' s the colour for a hearse or a taxi .
don' t be so conservative .
black' s a splendid idea .
hello .
look who it is .
sit down .
do join us .
can we have a word ?
our dreary broker has arrived .
hugo , follow me .
don' t go anywhere .
drink some more champagne .
especially you .
i like it when you' re drunk .
you' re the master of that .
what are you up to ?
we' re doing the number on these american birds .
who am i today ?
the earl of oxford .
the earl of oxford .
fucking hell .
what' s this business , then ?
it' s a bit strange .
can you find somebody for me really quickly ?
how quickly ?
20 grand quickly .
you' ve got our attention .
oh , very nice .
i suppose this is the boyfriend ?
it' s a bit unusual for you .
what' s going on ?
it doesn' t matter .
can you do it ?
yeah .
should be a doddle .
all the same , junkies and crackheads .
chuck ' em a few quid , they' il cough .
is there anything else ?
no .
we must get back to work , old boy .
look ...
all right , mate .
i' m the duke' s nephew .
remember me ?
sidney .
sidney .
yes .
hello , mate .
how are you ?
i' m just off .
have a nice night .
how you doing ?
what you doing here ?
i hear you' re doing business with my uncle , the duke .
why don' t you tell the whole fucking room ?
this is tammy .
who' s your mate , sidney ?
he' s a good mate of my uncle' s , the duke .
he was just going .
yeah , well stick around and have a drink before you do , yeah ?
yeah , all right .
i got vlp down here .
nice little booth .
charisma , he' s fucking got it .
i know he' s my uncle and all that , but you can' t deny it .
if you want anything , just tell me , ' cause i got ' em straightened out in here .
if you want any running about , i' m your man ...
line ?
what ?
i said do you want a line ?
no , mate .
you knock yourself out .
lovely , isn' t she ?
isn' t she a darling ?
isn' t she ?
siddy , baby , i could do with a livener .
sidney , it' s been great .
i' il see you , man .
thanks for the champagne .
all right .
you let me know when you' re happy , mr lucky .
too warm down your way ?
we' re kept busy , trevor .
everyone wants a slice as well .
same wherever you go .
greedy people .
yeah , it' s all clear , shanks .
you lot would know all about that , wouldn' t you ?
what the fuck' s that , shanks ?
well , not you lot , but ... ... that team down your end .
like you don' t know .
no offence , but what the fuck are you talking about ?
you really do surprise me , do you know that ?
do you know something we don' t ?
don' t be giving it the big fucking innocent , pal .
because i am not a fucking prick .
i never said you were , shanks .
cool it , shanks .
they really don' t know .
explain .
i was over in amsterdam .
last weekend , right ?
the whole place is alight with a rumour about how this hooligan outfit from down your end , run by this joker called the duke ...
gazza , go and find them fucking pills .
all right .
come on .
have a look in here .
they skanked this outfit , a proper , nutty serbian militia .
you' re the first person ever to be foolish enough to steal from me .
shut up .
but you' re not the first to point a gun at me .
shut up or i' il be the last .
fuck me .
they got lucky .
he' d just knocked up a massive batch .
fucking jackpot .
there' s fucking millions of the fuckers in here .
stay down there .
yes ?
you watch them .
that looks very heavy for you , darling .
fuck off .
why don' t you put it down ?
why don' t you shut up ?
a little girl playing games with guns .
i ain' t no little girl .
shut up !
you are shaking .
fuck off !
look at your arm .
fuck off !
put it down .
why don' t you listen to me ?
sit down !
fuck off !
baby , baby , baby , baby !
come here .
come here .
baby , calm down , calm down .
this will not be the end of this , mr duke , believe me .
gazza , go and load them pills .
but he got unlucky because this lot are wanted for fucking war crimes .
mass murder , ethnic cleansing .
they' re lunatics .
they' re wanted by the united fucking nations .
think about that .
let' s get this clear .
duke has absolutely sweet fuck all to do with us , understand ?
everyone in amsterdam believes that he has .
bandied your names about .
what ?
word on the straat is they' ve unleashed their top boy .
his name is ...
his party piece , right , is lopping people' s heads off then fetching them back to his boss .
it' s all about honour and respect with these head banging nationalist outfits .
they can' t have it getting about that anybody has took liberties with them .
but we had nothing to do with the acquiring of said merchandise .
ok , we accept that .
but with you lot up here punting this shipment , how does it look ?
bad .
you do know that we' re only talking pennies an article ?
stolen goods .
you won' t want them , then .
sit down , lah .
let' s not be too hasty .
me and him need to have a little think .
don' t think too long .
someone' s gonna make a killing on these pills .
they already have .
that' s the problem , kidder .
that prick duke' s made us look a bunch of fucking amateurs .
i told you he was trouble .
but he ain' t gonna drag me down with him .
try gene again .
what a fucking show up !
he' s not answering , mort .
ok .
try jimmy at home .
you sure ?
will you fucking ring him ?
where are we going , morty ?
back to that boat yard .
somebody' s about to get a fucking slap .
yes , morty .
about fucking time .
paul ?
what a way to go .
an iron burning a hole in your chest until your heart boils .
paulie would' ve told him anything , then , wouldn' t he ?
you see , that' s what happens when you do business with loons .
clarkie , have a sniff about .
make some phone calls , but really quietly .
find out where the duke' s holed up .
we' re gonna need an insurance policy .
what' s the fucking idea of phoning me at home and leaving messages , you prick !
jimmy , it was an emergency .
don' t fucking call me jimmy !
and what' s the idea of telling duke those pills ain' t worth shit ?
you don' t know the problems you' ve caused .
and don' t be leaving it to that pair of ponces , cody and tiptoes , to find that bitch charlie .
i fucking told you to do it !
are you listening ?
find a buyer for those pills .
the person moving those pills met a nasty end .
i don' t give a fuck !
that was quick .
the gaff is rotten in there .
kinky' s still here , isn' t he ?
didn' t tiptoes tell you ?
tell me what ?
have you let him go ?
no , i haven' t .
he' s in here .
kinky .
i still want to be paid .
so , if i' m correct , you three gearheads are gonna be clucking very soon .
in fact , you' re gonna be climbing the walls any minute , aren' t you ?
but i' m prepared to do you a favour .
we can do this one of two ways .
we can do it the nice way , which i think you' il prefer .
because the other way is my friend takes you and puts your head through the window !
right , so , was charlie here with kinky ?
yeah , she was here for a couple of days .
kinky turned up with five grand .
who' s giving kinky five grand ?
we don' t know .
they kept arguing .
she was saying , " do you think it' s that easy
taking the five grand ?
but she was still caning the rocks .
where is she now ?
brighton .
she kept begging kinky to go with her .
the other night , i hears this noise .
i' m looking out there .
it' s dark .
but i sees this geezer all in black .
it' s like something out of a kung fu film .
pay no attention to him .
he' s a nutter .
shut the fuck up .
and you , fucking tell him now .
what geezer ?
i don' t know .
i goofed out myself .
the next morning , she' s gone and kinky' s dead .
you telling me that somebody' s topped kinky ?
kinky overdosed .
he always was a greedy fucker .
i saw it with my own eyes , man .
you smoke too much of that fucking crack !
shut the fuck up !
you twat !
shut the fuck up !
get the fucking money !
morty !
morty !
this is dodgy .
that kid' s talking about murder .
he' s talking shit .
get to brighton and finish the job .
it all smells a bit fishy .
i' il double your money .
all right .
and ten g for finding kinky .
that wasn' t the fucking deal .
yes or no ?
yes .
hello .
ambulance , please .
185 kirby house , kings cross .
there' s a dead boy .
the door' s open .
my name ... ?
185 kirby house .
i' m not happy .
this shit is out of control .
you sort it out or i' il sort you out .
morty , kinky od' d , that' s all .
charlie woke up , found him cold , freaked out , fucked off down to brighton .
cody' s gonna find her .
look , i' m gonna freshen these teas up .
they' re cold .
morty ?
is that you ?
where you been hiding , then , eh ?
fucking hell .
what you doing down this neck of the woods ?
hello , freddie .
so ... ... mr mortimer .
here , morty , couldn' t spare us a few quid , for old times ' sake ?
you look well flush , bruv .
fuck me , he' s loaded .
here , couldn' t make it five , could you ... ... mate ?
let' s make it ten .
yeah .
ten' s ... ... a nice ... ... round number .
what' s the matter ?
what' s happening ?
been away ?
yeah .
ten fucking years .
going off ?
or do you need a red light ?
stop , morty .
enough .
he' s had enough .
i' il tell you when he' s had enough .
what the fuck is this ?
but let' s forget about all that .
let' s have a cup of tea , mr hurst .
what the fuck ?
i' m sorry about that .
i won' t be around for a while .
it' s me .
hey .
come on up .
i' il leave the door open .
how' s your day been so far ?
very fucking funny .
have you eaten ?
i' il have a chinky sent up .
no , i' m fine , thank you .
gene , who the fuck is freddie ?
he used to run with me , morty and jimmy in this real kamikaze firm .
in those days , we were headed up by this guy called crazy larry .
yeah .
got shot , didn' t he ?
bit of a lunatic .
that' s an understatement .
they were a spun out bunch .
always doing loads of drugs .
not worried about keeping a low profile .
i love you .
turn over anyone who couldn' t go to the law .
no fucking problem .
boys will be boys .
until one of them , kilburn jerry ... ... shoots himself stone dead .
this is a bit of a dilemma .
this desperate posse can' t call the law or an ambulance .
morty , out of some mad fucking sense of loyalty , actually volunteered to dispose of the body .
no head .
but things went a bit wrong .
the guy larry told to help him was freddie hurst .
the total imbecile had fallen asleep at some traffic lights in a drunken , drug induced stupor .
morty was still shut up in the van with the headless body of kilburn jerry .
being black was even worse than being irish .
they threw the book at morty .
freddie got three years for aiding and abetting .
morty did ten years because freddie hurst fell asleep ?
but he kept his mouth shut .
did his bird .
earned a lot of respect for that .
all because some kid was being ridden against his will by a psychotic lunatic .
who ?
but you , you fuck !
larry .
crazy larry was gay .
he was never gay .
larry used to say ...
fucking females is for puffs .
so who shot crazy larry ?
a boyfriend ?
probably .
larry made enemies very easy .
took liberties with too many straight lads .
not for me .
listen , son .
let me explain something to you .
freddie' s in intensive care with a bit of a brain haemorrhage .
you were there at the scene .
that' s called joint venture .
now , if freddie dies , you' re either in the dock with morty or you' re in the witness box putting him away .
think about that .
you know , i will have one of those .
all right , fellas ?
where' s duke ?
i don' t know .
what do you mean ?
i don' t know .
i thought he was here .
well , go and fucking find him .
he' s probably having a night out while us mugs babysit these .
gene , what the fuck am i gonna do about these serbs ?
come here .
i have something for you .
you' re gonna need one of these .
fuck me , gene .
i fucking hope not .
are you trying to scare the shit out of me ?
i mean , i fucking hate guns .
although that one is really pretty .
is that second world war ?
hey , point it upwards .
oh , for fuck' s sake .
here , let me see if it' s loaded .
you look like you could do that blindfolded .
i can and i do .
i find it very relaxing .
good for meditation .
meditation is concentrating the front of the mind with a mundane task so the rest of the mind can find peace .
and you find peace with guns .
well , on occasion .
it has been known .
listen .
i know it' s not your thing .
but if you ever have to kill somebody , never , ever tell a living soul .
who is this ?
my name is dragan .
how did you get this number ?
boatman paul gave me your number , in the end .
i believe you have some property that belongs to my employer , and you' re the person i should talk to about the return of this cargo , stolen by your associate , the duke .
dragan , the duke is nothing to do with me .
mr duke came to amsterdam , used your name , said he worked for you .
are you listening ?
dragan ...
i' ve got an idea .
why don' t you come round for breakfast ?
i' il squeeze some orange juice and we' il talk about this like adults .
how does that sound ?
sounds very hospitable .
do you know where i live ?
no .
well , fuck off , then .
duke' s gone missing .
he' s a fucking liability .
the pigs are everywhere .
this was meant to be easy .
no sweat .
calm down , gazza .
i' m sure duke' s just fine .
well , you' ve got 48 hours to find a buyer or i' m sending ' em back , ok ?
now , listen .
don' t do anything stupid , gazza .
it ain' t worth the grief .
we' ve gone underground , off the radar .
nothing personal , but i don' t trust you .
listen , i just had a phone call from gazza .
being a cry baby .
threatening to offload those pills in 48 hours .
between you and that gobshite duke , he' s promised jimmy a bumper pay day .
so get busy .
i said to jimmy i' d try and ...
he put yous together .
you and duke .
that' s his job .
if you two can' t make music , he' s gonna want his whack out either way .
that' s business .
i hope you put this dragan straight .
yeah .
i told him to fuck off .
what ?
please tell me you' re fucking joking .
well , i am beginning to regret it now .
we' ve got to find the duke , find these fucking pills .
we can' t rely on these monkeys to call gene .
we' ve looked everywhere .
there' s no sign .
you can' t find any of his firm ?
maybe this dragan geezer' s already found the duke and done the business .
yeah , well , there is someone i can call .
keep looking .
wait .
you' re gonna leave it to us ?
this dragan geezer is phoning me .
i am the target .
and if we don' t find the duke , this , everything , all over .
it' s me .
sidney' s mate .
oh , hiya .
what took you so long to call ?
i' ve been busy .
you sound sleepy .
you just woken up ?
not long ago .
so when am i gonna see you ?
what are you doing now ?
nothing .
no , i was just lying in bed , wondering what to do .
you still in bed ?
yeah .
you lying there naked ?
i' ve got a little t shirt on .
but that' s all .
here , wait , listen to this .
what' s that ?
i was just rubbing the phone against my fanny .
did you like it ?
my , oh my , it' s fresh this morning .
look at my nipples , standing up like little soldiers .
what is a girl to do ?
tammy , why don' t we meet up now ?
i' il book a table for lunch .
st martin' s hotel .
don' t worry about a table .
we' il have room service .
yeah , ok .
one hour .
hang on .
oh , shit .
oh , leave it off , sidney .
he' s driving me fucking mad .
we' re not expecting sidney , are we ?
he' s too busy kissing duke' s arse .
not round here , i hope .
no , over by greenwich market .
so you can relax .
it' s just the two of us .
patience .
all good things come to those who wait .
stay put .
hello , it' s me .
it' s me .
shut up and listen .
sidney , duke' s nephew is working down by greenwich market .
go and look .
room service .
look for that yellow range rover .
ok .
your champagne , sir .
i didn' t order ...
one moment , mr troop .
i want to hear what this bastard has to say for himself .
i' m jimmy' s old colleague , eddie temple .
fuck !
he told you to locate my daughter .
hunt her down like some lost mongrel .
he said you asked for his help .
mr troop could find anyone on the planet in ten minutes flat .
if you' d laid a finger on my daughter , you' d be over the edge like that .
you' d join that shit , kinky , who thought he could take my five grand and fuck me over .
the audacity .
how fucking dare you ?
i' ve known jimmy price for 45 years .
it pays me to keep an eye on him .
do you know what a remora fish is ?
yes .
oh , you do ?
well , jimmy has been swimming in my slipstream all my fucking life .
i thought he might put some volatile psychopath on the job .
but i' ve checked you out , son .
you' re a smart boy .
but you keep very , very bad company .
you know , i host a charity golf tournament every year .
quite an event in the social calendar , if i do say so myself .
i like to invite jimmy .
some of my friends find him absurdly hilarious .
drinks are on me .
drinks for everyone .
champagne .
fucking good gear and all .
but i' ve come unstuck in my attempts to provide a spectacle for my chums .
jimmy , as usual on the look out for titbits , has met the development minister of some tin pot republic .
they' re trawling the west for investments .
they have vast natural resources .
quite an investment for the right man .
they' ve sent in men from timbuktu explaining all the details .
profits , shares , long term investments , short term investments .
they' ve even made him an honorary citizen .
even made him one of the tribe .
what we didn' t know , until it all ended in tears , was that the hard line communist insurgents who control the country outside the mining areas ...
bad news about our little venture , jim .
the communists have broken through .
heading for the capital with little resistance .
what the fuck are you on about ?
i got word they were planning a push .
the final coup de grce .
i told jimmy .
it' s all over .
fuck' s sake !
keep your voice down .
get my money out quick , now .
as if it was some little kiddie' s piggy bank .
now , i explained that wasn' t possible .
we thought we' d bought a government .
maybe someone made a better offer .
forget about it .
you win some , you lose some .
how much are we talking ?
it' s only a cheeky half mill , jim .
it' s much more than that .
how much ?
13 .
13 what ?
13 million pounds .
i' m fucked .
have you gone fucking mad ?
13 million pounds !
how could you be so fucking stupid ?
you' ve been right grafted , royally turned over .
like some yank buying london bridge .
don' t talk to me like that .
he accused me of instigating it .
it' s no coincidence i met them at your tournament .
are you fucking demented ?
asked me to fly to zurich to see the minister , still parked up in la maison grande , still eating well .
big fat fucker .
on little jimmy' s nest egg .
jimmy thought he' d keep charlotte hostage while you went to get his money .
little jimmy was so stupid , he thought he couldn' t lose either way .
i' m sorry , what ?
if you find charlotte , he' s got his hostage .
if i find you trying to find her ,
i do his dirty work .
i' m still not with you .
your lives are inextricably linked .
i' ve found out something very interesting about jimmy , something i' ve long suspected .
but i' il let jimmy explain .
you follow me .
you' ve no doubt suffered jimmy' s
cld was geezers you was at school with " routine ?
the other chap' s albert carter .
another twisted bastard from the old neighbourhood .
member of the regional crime squad .
sit back , relax and enjoy .
it ain' t like your lot in the old days .
they' ve all gone squeaky .
tell me about it , jim .
i have to box clever with those college boys from anti corruption .
fucking dogs .
slags .
ten grand ?
it' s the going rate , jim .
ten k. hardly seems worth the bother .
well , there' s only so much in those informer funds .
what about gene ?
does he suspect anything ?
what ?
about me working for the old firm ?
listen .
gene ... ... is too loyal for his own good .
i don' t fucking believe it .
you better believe it .
' cause it' s fucking happening .
where did you get this ?
mr troop made it for me .
it' s one of his little hobbies .
i don' t fucking believe it .
don' t you want to hear what jimmy has to say about you ?
i' ve got one for you .
plucked and ready for the pot .
just give us a name and he' s gone .
in time .
i don' t want a bunce .
i want him out of the way .
flash young runt .
one of the new breed , ain' t he ?
reckons he can just waltz off into retirement .
i want him away for 12 .
if he' s got a kilo of class a , he' s looking at double figures .
i' il put it there myself .
sounds personal .
he' s got a few quid .
he' il come in handy .
i set him up with that slippery accountant in the first place .
fucking rag head let slip , didn' t he ?
you will miss him when he' s gone , mr price .
is that you , the flash runt who thinks he' s retiring ?
you' d no idea what jimmy was up to ?
how do you think these fuckers earn a living ?
i would' ve thought a smart young man like you would know that already .
can i have that ?
mr troop .
thank you .
this looks like you , son .
smart part of town .
i' il keep an eye open .
must dash off .
get home .
wash and brush up .
opera tonight .
the damnation of faust .
man sells his soul to the devil .
all ends in tears .
these arrangements usually do .
one more thing , young man .
always remember , the art of good business is being a good middleman .
bye bye .
fuck !
i' ve got him .
got who ?
sidney , remember ?
yellow range rover ?
seems they sent our friend out for something to eat .
good .
tell morty .
so what do we do now ?
call morty .
shut up and listen .
no more insults , no more games .
if i do not get my cargo back , you' re a dead man .
dragan , i' ve been doing some checking .
i' ve found out who you represent .
good .
i can point you towards your boss' s merchandise .
come to my hotel ...
look ...
i' d rather meet you in a public place .
you have nothing to fear .
i' m a reasonable man .
that' s not what i' ve heard .
i' il meet you at ...
i' il meet you at greenwich park observatory .
any taxi will drop you off .
i can read a map .
tomorrow .
midday .
tomorrow at 12 .
i' il be there .
that' s rude , mr dragan .
it' s conditions red down there .
they' re didgy as fuck .
they haven' t moved from that lock up .
have a look at the geezer at the front , on the door .
i know him from somewhere .
this could get messy .
what about the blokes in red ?
mechanics .
they got a ringing coup going on .
the lorries come in one colour , go out another .
but they' re nothing to do with the duke .
fuck me , look who it isn' t .
who' s that ?
it doesn' t matter .
i' ve got work to do .
stay here .
those pills move , call me .
you got it .
day and night , terry .
what do you mean " night " ?
i' ve been here all day .
get clarkie .
day and fucking night .
got it ?
hello , young man .
thank you for coming at such short notice .
i hope you didn' t feel too summoned .
how are you ?
i' m in the best of health , mr temple .
thank you for asking .
how are you keeping ?
i' m very well .
how was the performance of faust ?
complex .
no wonder it took him 60 years to write it .
how' s the family ?
what is this ?
a vicar' s tea party ?
you do sometimes take your conversations away with you .
being a clever bastard , are we ?
how do i know you' re not wired up ?
well , i' m not .
then we' il have to trust each other , won' t we ?
sit down .
i' ve been thinking , after our chat the other day .
your pills .
how much for the lot ?
no , i' ve already got a buyer .
nearly took my hand off .
he' s putting the money together now .
i told you , lah .
i' m still thinking .
it' s only been three days .
what' s the fucking hurry ?
what' s he paying ?
it' s confidential .
don' t be an idiot .
let me match his offer .
they' ve got history .
bad juju .
and , anyway , this serbian maniac' s in hot pursuit .
if i sold them to you , i' d have to disappoint him .
and he is definitely not ...
i did you a big fucking favour letting you know about jimmy .
i think you owe me .
2 million in sterling and euros , high denomination used notes .
so if i gave you three million , that would keep everyone happy .
let me state my position .
you can sell these pills to whoever you like .
that' s your privilege .
that' s your business .
but i' il tell you ,
i' il be very , very unhappy if you don' t sell ' em to me .
you understand ?
ok , mr temple .
three million .
done .
my buyer' s not gonna be happy , though .
fuck him .
he' il get over it .
i' m gonna need some help .
someone who can eliminate the problem .
someone who' s a bit handy .
whoa !
slow down , kidder .
mr lucky does a drop of freelance work .
i don' t need to know .
it' s none of my business .
you tell him when , and he' il come down on the train .
thanks , trev .
excuse me .
mr temple .
you deliver them to my warehouse .
when do i get my consignment ?
monday .
no , tuesday , probably .
tuesday ?
i' m paying over the odds , remember ?
england !
typical .
even drug dealers don' t work weekends .
that' s good news .
that should cheer gene up .
yeah , everything' s under control .
cody' s been chasing his ten grand .
yeah .
i' il call him later .
hey , geno , what' s up ?
got some good news .
oh , yeah ?
what' s that ?
you murdering bastard !
open the fucking door !
stay out of this , morty .
gene !
murder ?
who' s dead ?
jimmy .
he killed him .
blew his fucking head away .
open this fucking door !
why ?
open this fucking door !
get off him .
no , listen , listen .
just listen .
listen to me , morty .
i got a call from a cozzer we' ve got bent .
they found jimmy' s body last night .
in his own backyard .
it was this sly bastard .
he' s no killer .
somebody' s made a mistake .
all right , look .
here .
we' il see .
read it .
read it out loud .
to senior ranks only .
murder squad investigation .
james lionel price .
read the fucking ballistics report .
preliminary ballistics report .
no arms recovered .
disintegrated on impact .
one recovered cartridge casing .
you forgot to take the cartridge case .
you got sloppy . " ... consistent with weapon used
in unsolved homicide of lawrence gower aka crazy larry flynn .
wait .
i got it .
whoever killed crazy larry must' ve killed jimmy .
no , no .
the gun .
the fucking gun was the same .
the one he stole from my flat .
you killed crazy larry ?
so ?
this fucker killed jimmy .
oh , jesus christ !
why did you do it ?
he was an informer .
he was a police informer !
jimmy a grass ?
are you fucking mad ?
you' il have to do better than that .
i' ve got a recording at home .
of jimmy and a cozzer called albie carter .
gene , let' s listen to this shit .
if he' s lying , we' il both fucking kill him .
mr mortimer reckons the tylers are bringing in shooters from jamaica via manchester .
they got someone in immigration straightened out .
i don' t think anybody gives a fuck about spades shooting spades .
don' t you care about dead darkies , albert ?
what about gene ?
does he suspect anything ?
what ?
about me working for the old firm ?
convinced ?
you don' t fuck about , do you ?
jimmy was skint , huh ?
that' s why he set up the whole amsterdam business with duke .
i really think we should keep all of this to ourselves , right ?
really ?
why did you kill larry ?
funnily enough , it was jimmy who persuaded me .
jimmy never liked larry .
look at that wrong ' un waving his money around .
it ain' t right .
hey , i love you , man .
he saw the future was drugs and it needed to be run like a business .
crazy larry was no fucking businessman .
after that business with kilburn jerry ...
that' s it , son .
you do him .
bollocks !
... he wanted him gone .
i didn' t have any problem doing him .
that' s why i did it .
but why did you keep the gun ?
sounds silly now , but it was my favourite .
i hope you don' t tell the other guns you' ve got favourites .
so what' s the next move , boss ?
well , i' m going to bed .
i don' t know what you two are doing .
we can talk about it tomorrow .
sorry ?
sorry , mate , what was that ?
would you pack that in ?
i' ve got a fucking test next week .
ok .
ok , i' m sorry .
i was just saying ...
so when does the target get here , then ?
the target ?
the target' s gonna be here at exactly midday .
where ?
here , right fucking here .
got a photo ?
don' t worry about it .
who' s worried ?
i' il have some binoculars .
i' il give you a little signal .
i could get the 13 . 10 home from here .
let' s have a little recce .
after we do the business , walk slowly back .
remember , it' s a stroll in the park .
don' t run , whatever you do .
the first five minutes , nobody' il have a clue what' s going on .
hopefully , it' il be mayhem .
so try to stay relaxed .
don' t do anything to draw attention to yourself .
or me .
afterwards , take me to the underground station .
i' il look after myself .
there .
time ?
six minutes to twelve .
i hope he' s not gonna be late .
maybe he' il be early .
that' il be nice .
can you see that guy on the left ?
big fella , marching up the hill .
that' s our man .
are you sure ?
for fuck' s sake .
i' m gonna call him .
it' s up to you .
you' re the client .
as soon as he answers , he' s gone , ok ?
okey dokey .
stand by .
now .
hello , may i help you ?
don' t move a muscle .
do i have your attention ?
yes .
you english , you have no idea of honour and respect .
i usually kill for less .
i want my cargo and the duke .
i haven' t got your pills .
just give me a day .
don' t piss in my pocket and tell me it' s raining .
now listen for the last time .
you' il bring me what is mine .
look , i don' t ...
jesus !
you have one more day .
see you tomorrow at dusk by the statue .
remember , i will be watching you .
what the fuck were you thinking ?
getting trevor' s man down here to shoot this serb in a park !
trevor' s gonna go ballistic .
now , what the fuck do i tell him ?
what a fucking mess .
you' ve gone mad .
think you' re a gangster ?
fuck off !
you want to play ?
you do it somewhere else .
if you do it near me , i' il put you in a fucking wheelchair .
stick to your fucking sums .
listen .
listen to me .
dragan' s killed paul .
he' s done the duke .
he' s just put a bullet between lucky' s eyes .
i was there !
he' s watching our every move .
who' s next , me ?
i wish .
fuck off !
it could' ve been you or morty .
dragan said he wanted the pills and the duke .
where' s the duke ?
what ?
i should' ve told you this earlier .
duke and slasher came by the office the other day .
paul the boatman was topped last night .
i' ve got to get on my toes sharpish .
i want jimmy brought here right now , yeah ?
getting that smug fucking yuppie bastard to tell duke those pills were useless , after sending us over in the first place .
hang on , you' ve lost me now .
if you have us over , i swear by fucking almighty god , i' il call the fucking law .
what are you talking about ?
i' il call the law .
she didn' t mean that .
she' s upset .
shut the fuck up !
that' s where playing at being a gangster gets you .
you' re not in there ' cause i like you .
i' m beginning to feel left out .
why ?
freddie hurst is still in intensive care after your jolly little reunion the other day .
fucking hell , duke .
for once , you might be of some use .
that was gazza on the phone .
it' s on .
he' il pick you up at nine in the morning .
gallows corner .
you know it ?
yeah .
with jimmy gone , these pills will make a nice contribution to my retirement fund , so don' t fuck things up again , ok ?
if you do , you' il wish this dragan had shot you between the eyes , understand ?
best of luck .
thanks .
fuck off !
sidney , i' ve told you , stop answering my phone , ok ?
who was it ?
wrong number .
all right ?
hello , sidney .
how you doing , then ?
i' m all right .
how are you ?
i' m all right , mate , yeah .
gazza , this place stinks .
we want to get you out of here .
50 pence a pill .
that way , we all come out with something .
i think they' re worth more than that .
this is a reality check .
paul' s dead , jimmy' s dead .
duke and slasher , fuck knows where they are .
this gear is knock off , and the serbs you nicked it from , they' d kill you like you' d take a piss .
gazza , the old bill are outside !
gazza , no !
go , go , go !
let' s have it !
don' t point that gun at me .
put it down !
we' re going in !
gazza , look at me .
put it down .
you' re gonna get us all shot .
fuck it !
boat !
stay there !
fuck !
come on !
gazza , wait !
fucking hurry up , then !
get in .
is this for me ?
yes .
your cargo' s gone , i' m afraid .
it was seized by ...
i know already .
how do you know ?
i watched .
i don' t believe this .
captain' s gonna go fucking spare !
we are in shit .
you lot have fucked up again .
oh , fucking hell .
leave it to me , lads .
i' il explain to inspector cox that his suspect has scarpered ' cause of your blundering .
knobheads .
helmets off .
does this settle things , then ?
tango foxtrot , over .
delta uniform ...
how did that other errand go ?
success , as far as i could make out .
where is my fucking prisoner ?
you old ladies couldn' t catch a cold .
sir , i just ...
shut up , you soppy wanker .
indigo ...
dingo bongo .
is this area now secure ?
yes , sir .
you can fuck off , then .
so where are the pills , genius ?
i think this is them now .
what the fuck ?
couldn' t leave this behind .
greenies .
you are in the wrong game .
you should work with us .
are we square ?
yeah , we' re sweet .
it seems so .
your pills are in the back .
help yourself .
hello .
ok .
yes , i will do .
bye bye .
you' re off the hook , morty .
freddie hurst is out of his coma .
good news .
yeah .
good news , mate .
listen , i' ve got one for you .
irishman caught his son snorting charlie .
he said , " if i catch you doing that again , i' il rub your fucking nose in it .
do you have the pills ?
in the cars .
boss wants to see you in his office .
come in .
sit down .
here you are .
payment .
you look shocked , son .
are you taking the fucking piss ?
you and jimmy have caused my little angel charlotte considerable anxiety .
she' s off to arizona for a course of intense treatment .
i' m keeping those pills for myself , by way of compensation .
i think i' m entitled .
simple .
end of .
the amount of trouble you' ve caused the last few days .
jimmy .
poor little jimmy .
it would be in your interests if this thing finishes here , now , today .
understand ?
it doesn' t matter what i do .
this lot are gonna come after you .
they' re too long in the tooth to rampage round the country ,
looking for revenge .
look at ' em .
bunch of under endowed , ageing fuck pigs .
are you enjoying this ?
no .
on the contrary .
take it as a compliment .
you' re a bright young man .
this monkey business is in your blood , under your skin .
you' re not getting out , you' re just getting in .
i' ve every faith in you .
one day , it will be you sitting here telling some young turk the facts of life .
and they are , mr temple ?
you' re born , you take shit .
get out in the world , you take more shit .
climb a little higher , you take less shit .
until one day , you' re up in the rarefied atmosphere , and you' ve forgotten what shit even looks like .
welcome to the layer cake , son .
this thing ends here , tonight .
you understand ?
drug money' s easy money , not grief .
the odds , as you can see , are against you .
goodnight .
if you' re gonna hang around in this game , that' s where you' ve got to be .
in your bonded warehouse with the ex soldiers doing the dirty work , while you deliver the suspect lecture to baffle your opponents and cover your tracks .
the art of good business is being a good middleman .
putting people together .
i' il always thank eddie for telling me that .
it' s all about honour and respect .
this is the end , mr duke , as i told you .
do you know what ?
i fucking enjoyed that , brother .
just like the old days , shanks .
a nice bit of armed robbery .
all right ?
where do you want the money sent , lah ?
i' il let you know as soon as i do .
again , i am sorry about lucky .
don' t worry about it , kidder .
man was a prick , anyway .
later .
ready ?
yeah .
let' s go .
did i really think eddie was gonna give me three million for those pills ?
did i fuck .
but suddenly there was a void where once there was jimmy price .
and after a couple of days , eddie' s little getting in and getting out speech started to make sense .
angelo .
thank you .
thank you very much .
can we get some privacy ?
of course .
the king is dead .
long live the king .
well , i' m honoured .
but for me this is all over .
i' m getting out .
what was true then is true now .
have a plan .
stick to it .
so i' m sure you must have lots to discuss , but i have no business being here .
i' ve got someone to meet .
adis , amigos .
paul the boatman .
kinky .
the duke .
slasher .
kilburn jerry .
crazy larry .
mr lucky .
troop .
jimmy .
i don' t want to add my name to that list .
my name ?
if you knew that , you' d be as clever as me .
no !
i' m sorry .
