i just can' t take it anymore .
can' t go anywhere without hearing about that dumb woman !
oh , mama , not you too .
i' ve got some bad news , kid .
the tool has been cancelled .
what ?
your name is out of the paper too long .
i read about today , it' s the hart kid .
she' s hot .
and what am i supposed to do ?
suck up to her like everybody else ?
it couldn' t hurt .
over my dead body .
mind if i join you ?
lights out .
smoke ?
look what some johnny sent me .
triple cream caramel , all the way from san francisco .
i' m watching my figure .
you know , the trial .
hey , great mentioned that you' re on a trip today , huh ?
there have been so many , i just can' t keep track .
let me tell you , you' re exactly same size as my sister .
i mean , you fit into her costume perfectly .
really ?
yeah , and i' m just thinking , you know , with all the publicity piled up between us when billy gets us off , we would be a natural to do an act together .
you think so ?
ladies and gentlemen , miss velma kelly and desperation .
my sister and i had an act that couldn' t flop
my sister and i were headed straight fo the top
my sister and i earned a thou a week at least
oh , yeah !
but my sister is now , unfortunately , deceased
oh , i know it' s sad , of course
but a fact is still a fact
and now all that remains
is the remains
of a perfect double act !
watch this .
they have to match it with 2 people .
it' s just all two people .
first i' d ...
then she' d ...
then we' d ...
but i can' t do it alone !
then she' d ...
then i' d ...
then we ' ...
but i can' t do it alone !
she' d say , " what' s your sister like ?
i' d say , " men ,
she' d say , " you' re the cat' s meow
then we' d wow the crowd again
when she' d go ...
i' d go ...
we' d go ...
and then those ding dong daddies started to roar
whistled , stomped and stamped on the floor
yelling , sreaming , begging for more .
and we' d say , " o. k. fellas , keep your socks up . " you ain' t seen nothin ' yet !
but i simply cannot do it alone !
so what do you think ?
come on , you can say .
i know you' re right .
the first part is shit .
but the second part ...
second part is really nifty .
when she' d go ...
i' d go ...
we' d go ...
and then those two bit johnnies did it up brown
to cheer the best attraction in town
they nearly tore the balcony down
and we' d say .
okay , boys ... we' re goin ' home , but before we go here' s a few more partin ' shots !
and this ... this we did in perfect unison .
now , you' ve seen me goin ' through it
it may seem there' s nothin ' to it
but i simply cannot do it
alone !
so where' s the part we blew the brains out ?
okay , roxie .
i' il ...
no , don' t bother .
you think you' re fooling me ?
you' re all washed up .
and it' s me they want now , and i' m a big star .
single .
i almost forgot .
you' re in the paper today too .
ln the back .
velma kelly' s trial has been postponed indefinitely .
seven words .
here a little piece of advice .
direct from me to you .
lay off the caramels .
and now , for all you chicago' s stay up laters .
night hours would only come alive at the dark .
we dedicate this to you .
chicago after midnight .
this all took place in lesurevelt ?
lncredible .
all right .
thanks .
they just arrest this woman for triple homicide .
really ?
yeah , get this .
she' s an aries !
and her family is in the pineapple or grapefruit , some kind of fruits .
the demon kitty works in something ...
she' s playing house .
on the north side in an apartment , she met harry .
what harry does for living , no one' s quite sure .
but it doesn' t really matter cause she' s paying all the bills .
anyhow , kitty comes home tonight .
harry was already in bed .
she goes to change .
when she returns , she notices something rather odd .
there' re strippers in the apartment .
kitty disappears for a second .
and she returns , she gently wakes up harry .
harry says , " what ?
i' m alone !
alone ? " she says , " you have two other women in bed with you !
and harry says , " come on , darling , you gonna believe what you see or what i tell you ?
good night , folks .
miss baxter , miss baxter !
mary sunshine from the evening star .
would you mind saying a word or two ?
sure i' il say things .

it' s not your money .
it' s your mother' s money .

yeah , i' m sorry that i got caught .
okay , miss sunshine .
hello , roxie .
i got a letter from a guy .
he says he gonna hungry strike till i' m free .

miss baxter ...

and i' il be happy to get back to you myself .
billy ...
how does it feel , kid ?
pretty soon we couldn' t find your name in the papers .
mr. flynn ?
someone open the door immediately .
oh , my god .
roxie !
what is it to you ?
oh , no .
don' t worry about me .
i only hope the fall didn' t hurt the baby .
baby ?
shit !
well , doctor , is she or isn' t she ?
she is .
would she swear that statement in court ?
yes .
good .
i need to fly .
would just like to say that my own life doesn' t matter now .
it' s just that my unborn child .
poor girl , you' d have your baby born in jail .
my readers won' t stand for that .
i can assure you that won' t happen .
the trial would come in the least possible moment .
first time we' re ever have one more girl locked up .
hey , roxie ...
roxie !
i just have the good news !
i' m the father .
hey , roxie , who' s the father ?
the question is completely out of line .
how dare you insult this young woman ?
roxie , honey !
it' s me , it' s daddy !
roxie , i' d get to you as soon as i could .
if someone stood up in a crowd
and raised his voice up way out loud
and waved his arm and shook his leg
you' d notice him
if someone in the movie show
yelled " fire in the second row
this whole place is a powder keg !
you' d notice him
and even without clucking like a hen
everyone gets noticed , now and then ,
unless , of course , that personage should be
invisible , inconsequential me !
cellophane
mister cellophane
shoulda been my name
mister cellophane
' cause you can look right through me
walk right by me
and never know i' m there ...

mister
cellophane
' cause you can look right through me
walk right by me
and never know i' m there ...

i can only hope you would think about it .
amos , my name is amos .

it was the kid' s name i was thinking about .
you know when she dues ?
september .
you' d pass out those cigars anyway .
i don' t want you to give a damn on the people .
people what ?

laugh ?
why would they laugh ?
they can count .
can you count ?
september .
it' s the first copy of roxie' s statement from d. a. office .
says she hasn' t copulated with you for four months prior the incidents .
she would know .
yeah , i guess we' ve done no copulating since ...
wait a minute .
that doesn' t figure out right .
i couldn' t be the father .
well , forget about that .
my client needs your support .
you mean she needs a meal ticker ?
that' s all i' ve ever been .
this time she' s gone too far .
what you gonna do ?
divorce her ?
you' re damn right !
i' il divorce her !
she probably won' t even notice .
yeah .
i' m sorry .
a human being' s made of more than air
with all that bulk , you' re bound to see him there
unless that human bein ' next to you
is unimpressive , undistinguished
you now who ...
you' re still in here ?
yeah , i' m still in here .
shoulda been my name
mister cellophane
' cause you can look right through me
walk right by me
and never know i' m there ...
i tell ya
cellophane
mister cellophane
shoulda been my name
mister cellophane
' cause you can look right through me
walk right by me
and never know i' m there
never even know i' m there .
i hope i didn' t take up too much of your time .
i' ve been waiting for you 10 minutes .
don' t do that again .
this dress makes me look like a no worth lambshake .
i' m not wearing this .
you wear it because i tell you to wear it .
i' m not wearing this dress .
and when andy' s on the stand , i want you to do knitting .
knitting ?
for christ' s sake .
a baby garment .
i don' t know how to knit !
then learn .
that' s no way to win the jury' s sympathy .
you don' t need advice anymore ?
look at here , mr. mouthpiece .
it seems to me that i' m the one who' s coming up with the good ideas .
i' m sick of everybody telling me what to do .
and you treat me like dirt .
you treat me like some dump , common criminal .
but you' re some dump , common criminal .
well , it' s better than be a greasy mite lawyer .
we' ve been shaving your ass .
who ask for all that ?
he can steal !
maybe you' d like to appeal on court without me .
maybe i could .
have you read the morning papers ?
they love me .
there maybe a lot more when you hang .
you know why ?
' cause it' s sold more papers .
you' re fired .
i quit .
any lawyer in this town would die to have my case .
you' re a phony celebrity .
you' re a flash .
ln a couple of weeks , no one would give a shit about you .
that' s chicago .
no !
not guilty !
what happened ?
it' s hunyak .
she lost the last appeal .
so what does that mean ?
what that means ?
next week , she' s gonna ...
this is mary sunshine , coming to you from the cooke county jail , where history would be made today .
katelin helinsky would become the first woman in the state of illinois to be executed .
and so ladies and gentlemen ...
and now , ladies and gentlemen , for your pleasure and your entertainment , we proudly present katelin helinsky and her famous hungarian disappearing act .
bravo !
you know , it' s really not that bad .
you' re clear with everything you read ?
yup .
i' ve been up all night rehearsing .
what do you do when harrison come after you ?
i sit still and look straight ahead .

and ?
and i look modest .
and ?
and ...
and say nothing .
that' s right , that' s right .
that was the deal , right ?
right .
you ask me back , i do all the talking and stuff .
absolutely , billy .
whatever you said .
mr. flynn , the honours are here .
thank you .

yeah .
billy ...
i' m scared .

i' ve been around a long time .
believe me , you' ve got nothing to worry about .

razzle dazzle ' em
and they' il beg you for more !
object !
sustain .
your honour , i haven' t even asked the question yet .

razzle dazzle ' em
and you' ve got a romance
hello , amos .
amos ?
that' s right , mr. flynn .
amos , when did you file sue for divorce ?
a month ago .
was there any reason for filing at this particular time ?
i' d say , the newspapers said roxie was expecting a little stranger .
that' s hardly a cause for divorce , isn' t it ?
a little too much of a stranger .
you mean you doubted the fraternity of the child .
most sure .
tell me something , amos .
do you sleep with your wife ?
yes , sir , every night .
you expect the jury to believe that you slept next to this woman every night without exercising the rights of a husband ?
i could if i want to .
oh , but you didn' t .
no , i did .
did what ?
want to .
but you didn' t .
didn' t what ?
what you wanted .
wait a minute , i' m getting confused here .
hey , you tell me , hart .
since you ever question roxie herself , did you even bother to ask her if you were the father of the child ?
no , sir .
no .
what ?
lf you confirm that you were wrong , you' d be man enough in a minute .
you would take her back if roxie swore that you' re the father of the child ,
which she does .
she does ?
she does !
no more question !
you can step down now .
well done , andy .
roxie , i' m so sorry .
give ' em the old
razzle dazzle
razzle dazzle ' em
show ' em the first rate sorcerer you are
long as you keep ' em way off balance
how can they spot you got no talents ?
razzle dazzle ' em
razzle dazzle ' em
razzle dazzle ' em
this is the moment we' ve been waiting for .
roxie hart finally takes the stand in her own defense .
and they' il make you a star !
proceed , mr. flynn .
roxie , i have here a statement that you admitted having illicit relation with deceased fred casely .
ls this statement true or false ?
i' m afraid that' s true .
you' re an honestly girl , roxie .
when did you first meet fred casely ?
when he sold amos and me our furniture .
ln your personal relationship with him , you told the jury when that began .
when i permitted him to escort me home one night ,
i don' t think i would' ve gone with him if mr. hart and me hadn' t quarreled that very morning .
quarrel ?
yes , sir .
well , i supposed it' s his fault .
oh , no , sir .
it was my fault .
i supposed i just couldn' t stop pestering him .
pestering him ?
by what ?
i didn' t like him working those long hours at the garage .
i wanted him home with me ... to done his socks and iron his shirts .
i wanted a real home .
a child .
so you drifted into this illicit relationship because you' re unhappy at home .
yes , most unhappy .
roxie hart !
the state has accused you the murder of fred casely .
are you guilty or not ?
i' m not guilty ...
i killed him , i did .
but i' m not a criminal .
i' m not a criminal ...
roxie ...
did you recall the night of june 14th ?
could you tell the jury in your own words the happening of that night .
when fred came over , i told him a good news .
what was it ?
that me and amos are gonna have a baby .
and it was all over between us .
what happened then ?
then ...
did he threaten you , roxie ?
objection , your honour .
counsel is leading the witness .
sustain .
what does casely say when you told him the news ?
i' il kill you before i see you have another man' s child !
could you tell the audience ... the jury , what happened next ?
ln his passion , he tore off my robe and he threw me on the bed .
and mr. hart' s pistol was lying there between us .
and then !
and then we both reached for the gun and i got it first .
and then he came towards me with this awful look in his eyes .
he was angry and wild !
wild !
and did you think that he might kill you ?
oh , yes , sir !
so was his life or yours ?
and i just mine .
i closed my eyes and i shot !
to defense for your life !
and to save my husband' s innocent unborn child .
order !
what a bull' s eye , huh ?
order in this court !
roxie !
here in the courtroom ...
mrs. hart' s behavior has been truly extraordinary .
opening her eyes , she fenced herself with her attorney' s handkerchief .
handkerchief ?
poor child has no relief .
she looks around now , seeming to want something .
it' s a glass of water .
oh , mama , that was my bid !
i told billy , i wanna do that at my trial !
but now her eyes flatter wildly and she ...
mrs. hart has fainted again .
she flumps over her chiffon dress up around her knees , revealing a glimpse of blue garder with ryan stone buckle .
oh , mama , she stole my garder .
she stole my garder !
don' t break my radio !
first she steals my publicity , then she steals my lawyer , my trial date , now she stole my goddamn garder .
what do you expect ?
i mean these days you get a little success and it' s good rinse for the people who put you here .
it ain' t no justice in the world .
that' s nothing you can do about it .
you think they got you a page just to listen to my radio ?
people and publicity only interested in things when we think no one' s looking .
oh , mama .
state call for the witness .
left down on bible , raise your right hand and swear you' d tell the truth to god .
have a seat .
would you state your name for the record please .
velma kelly .
miss kelly , would you please tell the court the object i' m holding is the one you have come upon in the defendant jailhouse ?
yes , it is .
i submit this as appendix .
roxie hart' s diary .
i object !
my client never kept a diary .
even if she did , this would be invasion of privacy and violation of fourth amendment and illegal search without a warrant .
yeah , and she broke the law .
order !
well , that settles that .
i' il allow it .
what' s the big deal ?
she' s the one that did it .
lf you would read for us , miss kelly .
i haven' t worked in a while .
what a laugh , plucking fred casely .
the big baboon had a common .
i' m just sorry i only glad to kill him once .
i never wrote that .
you ...
hey , she made that up .
she made that up !
order !
please , mr. flynn , get control of your client .
i' m sorry , you honour .
it won' t happen again .
sit down and shut up .
or else it gonna get worse .
i have no more questions .
your witness , mr. flynn .
ladies and gentlemen , a tap dance .
tell me , miss kelly , you make a deal with mr. harrison maybe to drop all charges if you testify here today ?
oh , sure .
i' m not a complete idiot .
good .
since you gave such an impressive performance for mr. harrison , can you do me the same honour ?
i' d be delighted .
thank you .
fred casely assured me to get me an audition down at the onyx .
and then he reneged and that' s my motive for attack .
pretty fancy .
what you' re saying if a big fat liar who rogue on a deal so i shot him .
amos accused me of having an affair .
so i told him that the charge was erroneous .
objection , your honour .
mr. flynn is twisting the evidence to draw conclusion to the specious and the ...
erroneous ?
exactly .
order !
miss kelly , did you know the meaning of the word perjury ?
yes , i do .
you also know that is a crime ?
yes .
and for example if it turns out you knew this diary was a fake ,
i hate to think you rotting away in prison for the next 10 years especially when you just win your freedom .
all i know is what i was told .
so ... you didn' t find this diary in roxie' s cell ?
no .
mama ...
miss morton gave it to me .
she said someone sent it to her .
someone ?
any idea who this mysterious benefactor might be ?
no .
she didn' t know .
all right , let' s work this out .
someone who writes about reneging on pledges .
and ... erroneous charges ...
call me crazy , does that sound like a lawyer to you ?
a lawyer , who honestly has a sample of my client' s handwriting .
mr. harrison , do you have roxie to write out a confession to you ?
yes , but you' re not suggesting that i tempered with evidence , are you ?
no , let' s not be ridiculous .
that' s absurd .
unless you mention it .
your honour , this is outrageous .
outrageous ?
yes .
the prosecutor would made a thief bargain with velma kelly .
and then fabricated the very evidence and set her free !
mr. flynn , hold your contempt .
no , it' s not even conceivable .
but does it worked ?
would it be time to say ,
come clean , mr. harrison , come clean ...
this guy is a corruption .
i cannot stand .
that' s enough , mr. flynn !
i agree , your honour .
that' s enough !
it defend stress .
ladies and gentlemen , this is mary sunshine reporting live from the cooke county courthouse .
the city of chicago has come to a complete stand still .
as the trial of century finally draw to a close .
mrs. hart sits quietly at the defense table , hands folded .
what fate has installed for her ?
there' s hassles over the courtroom as the 12 men of the jury has back to their seats .
gentlemen of jury , have you reach a verdict ?
we have , your honour .
the jury has reached a verdict .
the defendant please rise .
what is your verdict ?
we , the jury , find the defendant ...
roxie hart is innocent !
she' s innocent !
roxie hart is free !
come on !
move it !
she shoots her husband and she crossed the lawyer !
hey , don' t you wanna take my picture ?
hey , i' m the famous roxie hart .
hey , what happened ?
what the hell happened ?
it' s chicago , kid .
you can' t beat fresh blood on the walls .
what about my publicity , billy ?
my name on the papers .
i was counting on that .
your attitude is not the one i get .
i just save your life .
you got $5, 000 .
what do i get ?
i get nothing .
five ?
actually it' s ten once i collect from velma .
i get nothing ?
don' t forget your diary .
it could be on mine .
i had a few erroneous phrases in there .
sorry , i couldn' t tell you .
take a chance .
never lost a case .
you' re a free woman , roxie hart .
and god save illinois .
roxie .
what do you want ?
i want you to come home .
you said you still wanted to ... and the baby ...
baby , what baby ?
oh , jesus .
what do you take me for ?
there ain' t no baby .
there ain' t no baby ?
they didn' t even want my picture .
i just can' t understand that .
what didn' t they even want my picture ?
it' s good ,

that could work .
a couple hundred ?
maybe we can ask for a thousand .
we' il worth it .
forget it , it' il never work .
why not ?
' cause i hate you .
there' s only one business in the world that' s no problem at all .
ladies and gentlemen , the chicago theatre is proud to announce the first .

chicago zone killer dealers , the lady sinners ,

you can like the life you' re living
you can live the life you like
you can even marry harry

isn' t it , grand ?
isn' t it , great ?
isn' t it , swell ?
