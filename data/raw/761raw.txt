that' s the ugliest thing i' ve ever seen in my whole life .
it certainly is .
who sent it ?
that' s strange , it doesn' t say .
who could' ve come from ?
i don' t like it .
it' s staring at me .
it' s probably one of your uncle' s jokes .
i don' t think it' s funny at all .
darling , i' m just going to have a shower .
i' il be there in a minute .
claudia , i told you not to leave your toys laying about .
good god , you are hideous .
claudia ?

i had a bond with you , young lady .
we had an agreement , didn' t we ?
didn' t we ?
but daddy , i didn' t leave it there .
ln a civilized society , our word is our bond .
i don' t know what you' re talking about .
just because it' s your birthday , doesn' t mean you can ...

six years ago , i found him in a cemetery back in the us ... the little fucker tried to rip me from hell .
i was trying to give you a hug .
i don' t know much about myself .
i know i' m an orphan , i know i' m a freak ... and of course , i know that i' m japanese .
but why do i have such terrible nightmares ?
filled with rate and blood and guts .
i' m not like that at all .
i would even hurt a fly .
there it goes , back to his family .
i envy him .
sometimes , i wonder about my own parents .
were they zen masters ?
did they serve the emperor ? .
sometimes i wonder what my mom and dad were really like .
so , you don' t believe in santa claus .
trust me honey , tonight i' m gonna make you believe .
wait to see what santa is bringing you , you naughty girl .

sheila , you' ve got to be fucking kidding me !
that' s just great .
i knew it !
you' re not real !
you were never real !
you know what that kind of disappointment can do to somebody ?
you have any idea how that can fuck with your mind ?

how come nobody takes me seriously ?
nice tits .

that sounds good .
what' s the role ?
virgin mary .
what' s so funny ?

it' s perfect !
it' s just what i need to reinvent myself .
the virgin mary .
i always loved the way she wears robes ... her hair off her face , kinda like this .
joan , get morty on the phone ... and tell him i need to have a meeting with this redman right away .

i don' t know what you' re talking about .
pete peters , celebrities reveal .
jennifer , what did you see ?
you want me to draw a picture ?
somebody give her a piece of paper !
i' m not going to draw a picture .
don' t feel bad , you' re an actress , not an artist , uh ?
what were you doing when you saw the body ?
no comments .
jennifer , i love you .
jennifer , i love you .
ls it true that you and redman talked about ... you starring in his new movie ?
yes , as a matter of fact , i ...
can i have your autograph ?
okay , sure .
we' ve heard about your obsession with chocolate .
hey , hold on , you forgot the head .
excuse me , excuse me .
jennifer , how old are you really ? .
paparazzi scum bag !
what year were you born ?
i want the set of the film , okay ?
sure .
what are you hiding ?
are you okay ?
i am now .
so are you a pair of ninja assassins ?
are you hit men for the yakuza ?
we' re not from japan .
we' re from jersey .
just think .
jennifer tilly is playing me in a movie .
it' s absolutely perfect casting .
but that voice ?
i know , she sounds just like an angel .
now i' ve got it all figured it out .
i' m gonna transfer my soul into jennifer ... and you' re gonna transfer your soul into redman .
i' m down with that .
we' il diss these plastic bodies once and for all ... and we' il be hollywood' s hottest couple !
what about me ?
don' t worry , glenda .
i' ve got that figured it out too .
you are going to be a real life girl .
boy .
how ?
well , i' m not getting pregnant again , i' il tell you that much .
my mother always told me ...
once is a blessing , twice is a curse .
that would explain your sister .
the only sensible option is a surrogate mother .
i have something important ...
hold on a second , sweetheart .
hello ?
what are you doing ?
i' m busy .
i do have a life , you know ?
turn on the news .
we have discovered the victim' s body .
as of yet there' s no official confirmation ... as to whether or not mrs. tilly is a suspect
jesus !
can you believe it ?
are you okay ?
i' ve had better days .
listen joan , i need you to do something for me .
i need you to get me a bottle of champagne ... and bring it by my house .
what for ? .
i' ve got a big night tonight .
tonight ?
with who ?
redman .
jennifer , what are you up to ?
thank you , joan .
come on , stan .
it' s just business .
he' il be outta there by midnight .
oh my god !
she' s a complete slut !
good night , glenda .
sleep tight .
leave it on .
oh sweetie .
there' s nothing to be scared of .
your dad and i will be right here .
why do you kill people ?
excuse me ?
why do you kill ?
it' s a hobby , really .
it helps us relax .
am i going to be a killer ?
of course !
it' s been a family tradition for generations !
but violence is bad , isn' t it ?
they said so on tv .
not violence .
violins .
violins are bad .
that scrutchy music is gonna ruin the godamn country .
chucky , glenda is right .
it' s time we owned up to it .
we have a problem with killing .
i don' t have a " problem " with killing .
i like a little killing now and then .
what' s wrong with that ?
killing is an addiction like any other drug .
but we' re parents now .
we have to set a good example .
let' s quit , chucky .
right now !
you have got to be kidding .
promise me , chucky , no more killing .
no .
chucky .
no , no ...
no more killing !
no , no ...
we can' t do it anymore !
no , no ...
we have the future to think of !
no , no !
we have a child !
fine !
alright already !
i promise .
thank you , doll baby .
you' re a sweetheart .
now we really will be the perfect family .
did you hear that ?
maybe you should forget the director and fuck the exterminator instead .
so how do i look ?
never mind .
jennifer , this is beneath you .
think about what you' re doing .
what the people are gonna say ?
who cares what people will say ?
don' t you see how evil this is ?
i don' t wanna hear it .
you' re prostituting yourself so you can play the virgin mary .
joan , i don' t wanna hear it .
this is so evil .
you' re going to hell .
no , hell would be ending up on " celebrity fear factor " ... in a worm eating contest with ann and nicole smith .
which you' d win .
he' s here .
let yourself out the back .
and while you' re at it , leave your key on the counter .
what are you saying ?
you think i' m so disgusting ... you think i' m going to hell .
i' m only trying to survive here , joan .
god knows i wouldn' t wanna drag you down with me .
i' m saying you' re fired .
i' m gonna get that ass ...
now in artificial insemination , timing is everything ... so you have to hurry .
that shouldn' t be a problem for you .
yeah , just don' t let that player get into her pants .
i don' t want him touching my woman ...
until i' m him , and you' re her .
right .
hey , aren' t you gonna give me a hand here ?
too tall .
lesbos !
done her .
here we go !
come to papa !
cheers !
you know , i wasn' t bullshitting when i told you i was a fan .
that' s so sweet , redman .
which of my films is your favorite ?
that movie where you and that chick were making out .
bound " .
everybody likes that one .
you' re still in touch with her ?
gina ?
yeah , we' re friends .
close friends .
very close friends .
maybe the three of us can hang out together sometime .
i' d really like that a lot .
okay .
i' il see if i can make it happen .
the bottom is up , baby .
redman , i was wondering ... what' s gonna take to make you seem me as a virgin ?
well , you tell me !
a masturbating midget ?
get it , mini me !
sweet jesus !
god bless the little people !
i don' t know if i can do this ?
why not ?
what will people say ?
fuck what people will say !
you know what i' m saying ?
this was meant to be , for real .
you know how i know ?
' cause the man upstairs told me so .
really ?
hell yeah !
mel gibson ain' t the only one god' s been talking to in hollywood .
and he personally told me , that you was my virgin .
what the hell ?
pig !
and you should be ashamed yourself .
where' s your self respect ?
you know what my mother used to say about dirty girls ?
she said " you can always smell it on the girls who sell it " .
by the way , can i have your autograph ?
i' m a big fan .
what am i supposed to do with this ?
mrs. tilly , i know you' re frightened .
you' re probably even wondering if you' ve gone completely insane .
but i promise you , tomorrow you' re going to wake up ... and this will all seem just like a bad dream .
ln the mean time ... we can do this the easy way , or the hard way .
it' s really up to you .
no wonder the girl is always in trouble .
check it out .
look at the size of his feet .
you know what they say .
geez , she' s fat .
i can' t believe it , she' s not even pregnant yet .
paparazzi scum bag !
looks like you' ve got everything under control .
i' il just leave you to it .
motherhood is so beautiful .
no , no ...
sorry , just messing with you .
what time is it ?
time to get dressed .
we' re gonna have our own boys ' night out , just you and me .
how does that sound ?
where are we going ?
hunting .
i can' t see anything .
maybe we should slow down ?
now , you' re doing great !
son of a bitch !
up yours , asshole !
what ?
not you , son .
come on , floor it !
ops !
i did it again !
jesus christ !
no !
oughta a boy !
no , i didn' t ...
and i thought you weren' t ready , kid !
you' re a fucking natural !
but he hit the shelf !
and don' t worry about your mother , it' il be our little secret .
say " cheese " .
good morning .
hi .
we must have really gotten wild last night .
redman , did we ... ?
you don' t remember ?
no , it' s all blur .
what about you ?
i remember you screaming a lot .
i seem to remember that too .
i have that effect on women .
really ?
yeah .
wait , i do remember .
i had the strangest dream .
i dreamt my guardian angel came to me .
she had the sweetest voice i' ve ever heard .
she told me to respect myself ... and then she asked for my autograph .
let ' see , step number one , admit i have an addiction .
okay , check .
step number two , give myself over to a higher power ?
whatever .
here we go .
step number nine : the recovering addict ... must make amendments to anyone he or she has harmed .
hello ?
good morning . is this ruth bailey ?
speaking .
the widow of robert bailey ?
yes , who is this ?
mrs. bailey ... my name' s tiffany ray .
you don' t know me , but a few years ago i killed your husband .
and i' m so very sorry .
ls this some kind of sick joke ?
no , i' m completely serious .
but i want you to know ...
i' m recovering now and i' ve put all of that behind me .

i' m pregnant .
redman , i said i' m pregnant .
congratulations .
who' s the baby' s daddy ?
don' t even look at me .
i haven' t slept with anyone else ... to advance my career lately .
who are you kidding ?
it' s true , redman , look .
i know i come off all sluty , but that' s for my image .
you think anyone would cast me in these sexy roles ... if they knew i hadn' t been laid in a year ?
i haven' t even slept with my driver yet ... and i think he really likes me .
that' s all very touchy and shit , but i' m telling you it can' t be me .
why not ?
i had a vasectomy as soon as i got to hollywood .
i ain' t no idiot .
that' s impossible , because ...
hey , jennifer .
i hate to break it to you ... but i can' t hire you if you' re pregnant .
that' s ridiculous .
the character is pregnant .
i know , but i have a very specific vision of mary .
what can i say ?
she' s gotta be hot .
that pig !
recovery hotline .
yes , i' m in recovery .
and i' m afraid i' m going to have a slip .

we' re not here to judge you .
what' s your name ?
tiffany .

yes , i do . ln fact , i' m gonna let you in a little secret .
just last week i had a slip .
really ?
yeah , and believe me , it was not pretty .
it never is , is it ?
no .
ln fact it took me three hours just to clean up the mess .
oh god , don' t remind me .
but i' m not beating myself over it .
you know why , tiffany ? .
why ?
because rome wasn' t built in a day .
you' re right .
you' re absolutely right .
hello ?
speaking .
who' s this ?
i understand who you are , i just don' t know how you got my number .
because it' s a private number .
pete peters ?
yeah , i saw him yesterday .
i don' t have any relationship with him .
he' s a paparazzi who started taking pictures of me ... in compromising positions .
redman is a director ...
oh yeah ... he' s a rapper too ... he' s a rapper director , okay ? .
bye bye .
jennifer .

i' m pretty sure it' s gonna affect my whole life .
i' d like to hear more reports on the weather ...
this is joan .
joan , i' m fat .
you' re not fat .
no , i' m fat , i' m huge !
for the love of mary , i' m pregnant .

you' re right and now god is punishing me .
my god . ls it redman' s ?

no , you decided !
just like you decided our son was a girl .
he is a girl !
he' s a boy , godamn it !
and he' s the most promising killer i' ve ever seen .
you should' ve been there , tiff .
you would' ve been so proud of him .
i want a girl !

i think i want to be a boy .
yes ! ln your face , lady !
but being a girl would be nice too .

i' m not sure .
sometimes i feel like a boy ... sometimes i feel like a girl .
can i be both ?
well , some people ...
no way !
but one thing i do know for sure .
i don' t want to be a killer .
glenda , glen , whatever .

no matter what happens ... we' il deal with it together , as a family .
okay , tiff san .

i' m not gonna let you poison our son' s mind ... with your touchy feely twelve step bullshit .
lf you two don' t wanna kill anymore , that' s your loss .
but don' t look down your noses at me .
i' m not ashamed to be a killer , i' m proud of it .
it' s not an addiction , it' s a choice .
and it' s not something that you should have to hide in the closet .
oh dear !
oh god !
well , well , well ...

there' s a limit to how much i can take .
what are you talking about ?
look around you , tiff .
this is nuts !
and i have a very high tolerance for nuts .
lf this is what it takes to be human ... then i' d rather take my chances as a supernaturally possessed doll ... it' s less complicated .
you can' t be serious .
as a heart attack .
think about it .
what' s so great about being human anyway ?
you get sick , you get old , you can' t get it up anymore .
i' m not looking forward to that .
honey , i wanna be jennifer tilly .
i wanna be a star .
and i don' t wanna be your chauffer .
as a doll , i' m fucking infamous !
i' m one of the most notorious slashers in history .
and i don' t wanna give that up !
i' m chucky , the killer doll !
and i dig it !
i have everything i want .
a beautiful wife .
a multi talented kid .
this is who i am , tiff .
this is me !
chucky , i don' t know what the fuck you' re talking about ...
i don' t know who the fuck you are anymore .
but it' s not enough for me .
i want more .
what are you saying ?
it' s over .
we' ve gotta get out of here , sweet face .
i' m leaving you , chucky , and i' m taking the kid .
nobody leaves me !
nobody !

jennifer , i love ...
stan tell me , tell me ...
jesus !
oh my god !
my babies !
i just wanna know where they are .
they' re fine , jennifer .
they' re in the maternity ward .
alright ...
the important thing for you ... to think about now is getting well so you can get on with your career .
i don' t care about my career , i want my babies .
i' m working on it jennifer , but you' re not making it easy .
i already talked to the cops , they cleared me .
they know that you' re not a killer ... they didn' t say you were mentally competent .
what do you expect after the story you told ?
it' s true .
i suggest from now on you keep that to yourself .
we' il talk later .
try to get some sleep .
wish me luck , sweet face .
mommy is gonna be a star .
i can' t think of a thing to say .
fuck it !
give me the power , i beg of you .
switch !
switch !
switch !
switch !
nobody leaves me !
nobody !

don' t make the same mistakes your mom and dad made .
specially your dad .

fulvia , just exactly are you trying to say ?
i can' t work here anymore .

lf you only saw the way she looks at me with such ... hate .
alright fulvia , if that' s what you want .
we' il miss you .
