i' ve never been through here before .

hi .
you really like my table , don' t you ?
i was just ...
getting to know my daughter .

you don' t look old enough to have a daughter .
i mean it .
and you don' t look like a daughter .
that' s possibly very sweet of you .
thanks .
so , daughter .
you know , i am traveling with a friend .
she' s 16 .
bye .

here you go .
thanks .
independence inn , michel speaking .

no , there is really nothing i can do .
yes , i' m sure .
positive .
no , i don' t have to look , ma' am .
yes , of course i' il look .
no , i' m sorry .
we' re completely booked .
no , don' t move .
just ignore the tiny woman pushing the 200 pound instrument around .
this is good .
i like this .
maybe after this i' il bench press a piano .
that' s it , lady .
tie your shoe now .
don' t worry .
i' il wait .
hi , drella .
hi .
i was just wondering , could you be nicer to the guests ?
i' m sorry .
did you not want a harp player ?
yes , i did .
did you not want a great harp player ?
yes , i did .
i am a great harp player .
and this is my great harp , okay ?
so if you just want someone to be nice to the guests ... get a harmonica player .
some guy who whistles through his nose .
okay ?
capisce ?
and that is a great spot for a table .
the decorator' s a genius .
madame , you have no idea how desperately i' d like to help ... but i' d have to build a room for you myself ... and i' m not a man who works with his hands .
so the best i can do is suggest ... that you please try for another weekend .
any weekend .
good .
fine .
the 21st .
hold on , i' il look .
no , i' m sorry .
we' re completely booked .
has the plumber attended to room 4 yet ?
he was here .
he did nothing .
it' s $100 .
hi , marco .
lorelai .
talk to me about room 4 .
what was wrong with it ?
i thought you replaced that already .
because you told me you did .
i never forget anything .
so this one' s on you , right ?
pleasure doing business with you .
what is your offspring doing ?
i need stamps .
can i have these ?
no .
take them .
what' s with the muumuu ?
stop .
you couldn' t find one made of metal , in case anyone has x ray eyes ?
and now we say goodbye .
have michel look at your french paper before you go .
excuse me ?
that would be great .
no .
come on , michel .
i' il tell all the ladies what a stud you are .
i believe that memo has already been sent .
please , michel .
pretty please with sucre on top ?
i will stop talking like this .
leave it .
i' il look at it if i get a chance .
it' s due tomorrow .
and pay special attention to the grammar .
i despise you .
when are you gonna let your parents know that you listen to the evil rock music ?
you' re an american teenager , for god' s sake .
if my parents still get upset ... over the obscene portion size of american food ...
i seriously doubt i' m going to make any inroads with eminem .
i have to go to that .
the hayride ?
you' re kidding .
my parents set me up with the son of a business associate .
he' s gonna be a doctor .
how old is he ?
sixteen .
so he' s gonna be a doctor in 100 years .
my parents like to plan ahead .
you have to go to the hayride with him ?
and his older brother .
now you' re kidding .
koreans never joke about future doctors .
i guess you' re not going ?
no .
i' m still fuzzy on what' s fun about sitting in the cold for two hours ...
with a bundle of sticks up your butt .
don' t expect me to clear it up for you .
for those of you who have not finished the final chapters of huckleberry finn ... you may use this time to do so .
for those of you who have , you can start on your essay now .
whichever task you choose , do it silently .
maybe it' s a love letter .
or her diary .
could be a slam book .
it' s the assignment .
nice , huh ?
it' s beautiful .
tell it to the tip jar .
take the bags up to 314 .
make sure the drapes are closed and there' s extra soap ... and she wants her pillow mints now .
sookie !
i' m okay .
what did you do now ?
why weren' t you watching her ?
no estabas cuidandola ?
no .
she' s this .
bad food in the head .
i need you to be more careful .
i know .
i' m sorry .
i fixed the peach sauce .
that' s blood .
why are you bleeding ?
my stitches opened .
i was using too much maple syrup .
it strangled the fruit .
when did you get stitches ?
friday night .
radish roses .
okay , stop moving .
you gotta taste the sauce while it' s still warm .
sookie , i need you to be more careful .
i need there to be fewer accidents .
dear god almighty , that' s incredible !
i' il put it on the waffles tomorrow morning for breakfast .
i wanna take a bath in that sauce .
i will make more .
someday when we open our own inn , diabetics will line up to eat this sauce .
won' t that be great ?
the key to someday achieving that dream is for you to stay alive long enough ... so we can actually open an inn , you understand ?
yes , i understand .
all right .
now let' s get you up and to the doctor on three .
one , two , three .
what ?
stepped on my thumb .
i' m fine .
on three .
okay .
was it a good color , at least ?
it had sparkles in it .
and it smelled like bubble gum when it dried .
there' s no way mark twain could compete with that .
mom , we' re home !
did you hear something ?
i' m not sure .
mom , are you here ?
we' re open .
everything' s half off .
we have contact .
mom !
lane ?
mom , where are you ?
lane , where are you ?
back here .
over here .
i think she' s that way .
are we closer ?
i' m by the table .
she' s kidding , right ?
look , we' il meet you in the kitchen .
what ?
the kitchen !
who' s that ?
it' s rory , mom .
i could hear the disappointment from here .
come on .
stop it .
it sucks that after all these years your mom still hates me .
she doesn' t hate you .
she hates my mother .
she doesn' t trust unmarried women .
you' re unmarried .
i' m hayriding with a future proctologist .
i have potential .
go upstairs .
tea is ready .
i have muffins .
no dairy , no sugar , no wheat .
you have to soak them in tea to make them soft enough to bite ... but they' re very healthy .
how was school ?
none of the girls get pregnant , drop out ?
not that we know of .
though come to think of it , joanna posner was glowing a little .
what ?
nothing , mama .
she' s just kidding .
boys don' t like funny girls .
noted .
hello !
anybody here ?
we' re here .
we' re coming .
have the muffins made from sprouted wheat .
only good 24 hour .
everything' s half off !
where are you ?
over here !
where ?
by the chair !
what chair ?
careful !
i' m okay .
peppers .
mike .
hello , little vegetables .
come with me .
i got it .
where' s my glaze ?
in the counter .
on the counter .
on , not in the counter .
okay , good .
all right .
my sauce .
that' s pretty good .
hello .
a little bit of green .
okay .
hello , my little babies .
you like that ?
a little bit of juice .
you' re very pretty .
okay .
it' s here .
it happened .
she did it .
i' m gonna need a longer sentence .
the chilton school .
rory got in .
oh , my god !
i know .
look .
we are happy to inform you we have a vacancy at chilton preparatory ... " " starting immediately .
due to rory' s excellent credentials ... " " and your enthusiastic pursuit of her enrolment ...
i offered to do the principal to get her in . " ... we' d be happy to accept her once the first semester' s tuition is received .
this is very exciting .
is something burning ?
my bangs .
earlier .
go on .
she can finally go to harvard like she' s always wanted ... get the education i never got , and do all the things i never got to do .
then i can resent her for it ... and we can finally have a normal mother daughter relationship .
mom ?
you' re happy .
yeah .
did you do something slutty ?
i' m not that happy .
here .
what' s going on ?
open it .
i' m gonna be in a britney spears video ?
you' re going to chilton !
sorry .
mom ?
you did it , babe .
you got in .
how did this happen ?
you didn' t with the principal , did you ?
no .
that was a joke .
they have an open spot .
you' re gonna start on monday .
really ?
really .
i don' t believe this .
my god , i' m going to chilton ?
sookie , i' m going to chilton !
i' il make cookies .
protestants love oatmeal .
i have to call lane .
i love you .
i love you .
my girl' s going to chilton .
yeah , i know .
rory' s going to chilton !
michel , the phone .
it rings .
can you answer it ?
no .
people are particularly stupid today .
i can' t talk to any more of them .
you know who' s really nice to talk to ?
the people at the unemployment agency .
independence inn , michel speaking .
no , i' m sorry , we' re completely booked .
i' m holding for miss bell .
i' ve been trying to get ahold of her all day .
lorelai gilmore .
hi .
yeah , my daughter rory has just been accepted .
thank you .
and i got the invoice for your enrolment fee .
that is a lot of zeroes behind that five .
okay , i guess what i' m wondering is ... if you couldn' t take , say , part of it now , just to get her going ?
but she' s supposed to start monday .
it just doesn' t give me a lot of time to pull a bank job .
never mind .
i was just kidding .
no , a bank job is robbing a bank , but ...
no .
i don' t want you to give up her space .
i' il have to figure it out .
okay .
no , thank you .
it' s been a real treat talking to you .
yeah .
bye bye .
what do i do ?
you can have anything i own .
my car .
sell my car .
sweetie , no one wants your car .
there' s something i haven' t thought of .
there' s something out there staring me right in the face .
i haven' t seen it .
you might consider calling ...
no .
but i don' t think you have ...
stop .
you can at least go and ...
okay , can i say one more thing ?
i think it' s your only option .
there are several chapters from a stephen king novel i' d reenact ... before i' d resort to that option .
okay , dropped .
thank you .
mom , so what do you think ?
it makes you look smart .
okay , no more wine for you .
mom ?
you look like you were swallowed by a kilt .
fine , you could hem it .
a little , only a little .
okay .
or i could hem it a lot .
no , i don' t want it to be too short .
i can' t believe tomorrow' s my last day at stars hollow high .
i know .
today i was so excited , i dressed for gym .
you' re kidding !
and i played volleyball .
with other people ?
and i learned all this time i was avoiding group sports ... was very smart , because i suck at them .
you got that from me .
where' s your pate ?
at zsa zsa gabor' s house .
i' m going to the store , because you have nothing .
do you feel like duck ?
lf it' s made with chicken , absolutely .
i' il be back .
bye .
all right , this will give you an idea .
go see how you like it .
okay .
i love being a private school girl .
hi , mom .
lorelai !
my goodness , this is a surprise .
is it easter already ?
no , i just finished up my business class , and i thought i would stop by .
to see me ?
yes .
isn' t that nice .
come in .
thanks .
the place looks great .
it hasn' t changed .
there you go .
how are the girls at the bridge club ?
old .
good .
you said you were taking a business class ?
yeah .
i' m taking a business class at the college twice a week .
i' m sure i told you .
if you' re sure , then you must have .
would you like some tea ?
i would love some coffee .
emily , i' m home .
we' re in here .
hi , dad .
what is it , christmas already ?
lorelai was taking a business class at the college today ... and decided to drop in to see us .
what business class ?
she told us about it , dear .
remember ?
no .
actually , i came here for a reason .
dad , would you mind sitting down for a minute ?
you need money .
i have a situation .
you need money .
dad , just please let me get this out , okay ?
rory has been accepted to chilton .
chilton ?
that' s a wonderful school .
it' s only five minutes from here .
that' s right , it is .
she can start as early as monday .
the problem is that they want me to put down an enrolment fee ... plus the first semester' s tuition .
i have to do that immediately or she loses her spot .
so you need money .
yeah .
but it' s not for me , it' s for rory .
i intend to pay you back , every cent .
i don' t ask for favors .
you know that .
yes , we know .
i' il get the checkbook .
thank you .
you have no idea .
thank you .
on one condition .
so close .
since we are now financially involved in your life ...
i want to be actively involved in your life .
what does that mean , mother ?
i want a weekly dinner .
what ?
friday nights , you and rory will have dinner here .
mom .
and you have to call us once a week ... to give us an update on her schooling and your life .
that' s it .
that' s the condition .
if you agree , you' il come to dinner tomorrow night ... and leave here with the check .
otherwise , i' m sorry , we can' t help you .
i don' t want her to know that i borrowed money from you .
can that just be between us ?
does 7 : 00 work for you ?
perfect .
and we get to wear uniforms .
no more people checking you out to see what you' re wearing ...
' cause everyone' s dressed alike in boring clothes , just there to learn .
okay , there' s academic minded , and then there' s amish .
funny .
thank you .
i told my mom you' re changing schools .
was she thrilled ?
the party' s on friday .
i got to go .
i have to have a pre hayride cup of tea with a future doctor .
how do i look , korean ?
spitting image .
good .
bye .
bye .
god !
you' re like ruth gordon , just standing there with the tannis root .
make a noise .
rosemary' s baby .
yeah .
that' s a great movie .
you' ve got good taste .
are you moving ?
no , just my books are .
my family just moved here from chicago .
chicago .
windy .
oprah .
yeah , that' s the place .
i' m dean .
hi .
rory .
me .
that' s me .
lorelai , technically .
lorelai .
i like that .
it' s my mother' s name , too .
she named me after herself .
she was in the hospital thinking about how men name boys after themselves ... so why couldn' t women ?
she says her feminism took over .
personally , i think a lot of demerol also went into that decision .
i never talk this much .
i better go .
sure .
i have to go look for a job .
okay , good .
you should check with miss patty .
what ?
about the job .
you should check with miss patty .
she teaches dance .
she was actually on broadway once .
i don' t really dance much .
no , she just knows everything that' s going on in town .
she' il know if someone' s looking .
great .
thanks .
what are you doing now ?
nothing much .
i should throw this away at some point .
maybe you could show me where this miss patty' s place is .
yeah , i guess so .
i really don' t have anything important to ...
let' s go .
have you lived here all your life ?
yes .
pretty much .
i was actually born in hartford .
that' s not far .
thirty minutes with no traffic .
really ?
i timed it .
okay , then .
do you like cake ?
what ?
they make really good cakes here .
they' re very round .
okay , i' il remember that .
good .
make a note .
you wouldn' t want to forget where the round cakes are .
how are you liking moby dick ?
it' s really good .
yeah ?
yeah , it' s my first melville .
cool .
i know it' s cliche to pick moby dick as your first melville , but ...
how did you know i was reading moby dick ?
i' ve been watching you .
watching me ?
not in a creepy i' m watching you sort of way .
i' ve noticed you .
me ?
yeah .
when ?
every day .
after school , you come out and sit under that tree , and you read .
last week it was madame bovary .
this week it' s moby dick .
but why would you ...
because you' re nice to look at ... and because you' ve got unbelievable concentration .
what ?
last friday , two guys were tossing a ball ... and one guy nailed the other right in the face .
it was a mess .
blood everywhere , the nurse came out ... the place was in chaos , his girlfriend was freaking out ... and you just sat there and read .
you never even looked up .
i thought , " i' ve never seen anyone read so intensely before in my entire life .
i have to meet that girl .
maybe i just didn' t look up because i' m unbelievably self centered .
maybe , but i doubt it .
did i ask you if you like cake ?
yeah , you did .
' cause they have really good cake back there .
you were late getting home tonight .
yeah , i went to the library .
we' re having dinner with the grandparents tomorrow night .
we are ?
but it' s september .
so ?
so what holiday is in september ?
look , it' s not a holiday thing .
it' s just dinner , okay ?
fine .
sorry .
red meat can kill you .
enjoy .
i finished hemming your skirt today .
a grunt of acknowledgement might be nice .
why are we going to dinner tomorrow night ?
what if i had plans ?
you didn' t even ask me .
lf you had plans , i' d have known .
how ?
you would' ve told me .
i don' t tell you everything .
i have my own things .
fine , you have things .
that' s right .
i have things .
i had dibs on being the bitch tonight .
just tonight ?
what the hell is wrong with you ?
i' m not sure i want to go to chilton .
what ?
the timing is just really bad .
the timing is bad ?
and the bus ride to and from hartford , it' s 30 minutes each way .
i can' t believe what i' m hearing .
i don' t think we should be spending that money right now .
i know chilton' s got to be costing you a lot .
you' ve no idea .
your money should be going into buying an inn with sookie .
what about college ?
what about harvard ?
we don' t know i can' t get into harvard if i stay where i am .
enough of the crazy talk , okay ?
i appreciate your concern , but i have this covered .
i still don' t want to go .
why ?
because i don' t .
i have to get out of here .
we have to pay first .
one , two , three .
it' s a waltz , ladies .
susie , do you have to tinkle ?
then uncross your legs , darling .
rory , i think i found a job for your male friend .
what male friend ?
they need a stock boy at the supermarket .
i already talked to taylor doose about him .
just send him around tomorrow .
okay , thanks .
what male friend ?
he' s very cute .
you have good taste .
hands in the air , not in the nose .
you' il have to walk faster than that .
you' il have to turn into frigging flo jo to get away from me .
this is about a boy .
of course !
i can' t believe i didn' t see it .
all this talk about money and bus rides .
you' ve got a guy , and you don' t wanna leave school .
i' m going to bed .
god , i' m so dense .
it should' ve been my first thought .
after all , you' re me .
i' m not you .
really ?
someone ready to throw important life experiences out to be with a guy ?
it sounds like me to me .
whatever .
who is he ?
there' s no guy .
dark hair , romantic eyes , looks a little dangerous ?
this conversation' s over .
tattoos are good , too .
i don' t wanna change schools because of all the reasons ...
i' ve already told you a thousand times .
if you don' t want to believe me , that' s fine .
goodnight .
does he have a motorcycle ?
if you' re going to throw your life away , he' d better have a motorcycle !
i think that went pretty well , don' t you ?
thanks for the knock .
listen , can we just start all over , okay ?
you tell me all about the guy , and i promise not to let my head explode .
rory , please talk to me .
okay , i' il talk .
don' t get me wrong , guys are great .
i am a huge fan of guys .
you don' t get knocked up at 16 being indifferent to guys .
babe , guys are always gonna be there .
this school isn' t .
it' s more important .
it has to be more important .
i' m going to sleep .
you' ve always been the sensible one in this house .
i need you to remember that feeling now .
you will kick your own butt later if you blow this .
it' s my butt .
good comeback .
thank you .
you' re welcome .
rory , come on .
i don' t want to talk about this .
could you please just leave me alone ?
okay .
fine .
we' ve always had a democracy in this house .
we never did anything unless we both agreed .
but now i guess i' m gonna have to play the mom card .
you are going to chilton whether you want to or not .
monday morning , you will be there .
end of story .
we' il see .
yeah , we will .
okay .
one , two ...
i swear i don' t know what happened .
it' s not important .
i' ve made that dish a hundred times .
it never exploded .
please forget it .
god , i killed a viking .
you should fire me or make me pay the cost of a new stove ...
out of my paycheck .
whatever you want .
i can' t afford a new stove .
those things are expensive .
sookie , please , i am begging you , pull yourself together .
i got no sleep last night , and i think i put my contacts in backwards .
rory' s still mad at you ?
i' m not so crazy about her , either .
it was a fight .
mothers and daughters fight .
no , we don' t fight .
we never fight .
you told me to tell you when your daughter arrived .
she' s here , and she' s sitting in my chair .
hold on just a minute .
and you are the one left standing .
life is a funny thing , no ?
no muumuu today .
you know what' s weird ?
i kind of miss it .
you left me a note to meet you here .
i thought you might want to work a couple hours , make a little extra cash .
fine .
you' re not gonna give me ... the mommie dearest treatment forever , are you ?
you wanted me here , i' m here .
should i do something or what ?
yeah , go home .
dinner' s at 7 : 00 .
be ready to go .
fine .
fine .
my chair .
do we go in or do we just stand here reenacting the little match girl ?
look , i know we' re having a thing here , and i know you hate me ... but be civil , at least through dinner ... and then on the way home you can pull a menendez .
deal ?
fine .
hi , grandma .
you' re right on time .
yeah , no traffic at all .
i can' t tell you what a treat it is to have you girls here .
we' re excited , too .
is that a collector' s cup , or can i throw it away for you ?
in the kitchen , please .
sorry .
i want to hear all about chilton .
i haven' t actually started yet .
richard , look who' s here .
rory .
you' re tall .
i guess .
what' s your height ?
5' 7 " .
that' s tall .
she' s tall .
hi , dad .
lorelai , your daughter' s tall .
i know .
it' s freakish .
we' re thinking of having her studied at mlt .
champagne , anyone ?
that' s fancy .
it' s not every day i have my girls here for dinner ... on a day the banks are open .
to rory entering chilton ... and an exciting new phase in her life .
hear , hear .
let' s sit , everyone .
this is just wonderful .
an education is the most important thing in the world , next to family .
and pie .
joke .
rory , how do you like the lamb ?
it' s good .
too dry ?
no , it' s perfect .
the potatoes could use a little salt , though .
excuse me ?
so , grandpa , how' s the insurance biz ?
people die , we pay .
people crash cars , we pay .
people lose a foot , we pay .
at least you have your new slogan .
how are things at the motel ?
the inn ?
they' re great .
lorelai' s the executive manager now .
isn' t that wonderful ?
speaking of which , christopher called yesterday .
speaking of which ?
how is that a speaking of which ?
he' s doing very well in california .
his internet start up goes public next month .
this could mean big things for him .
very talented man , your father .
she knows .
he always was a smart one , that boy .
you must take after him .
speaking of which , i' m going to get a coke .
or a knife .
hi , how are you doing ?
i think i' m going to go talk to her .
no .
i' il go .
you stay and keep your grandfather company .
lorelai , come back to the table .
is it going to be like this every friday night ?
i come over and let the two of you attack me ?
you' re being very dramatic .
dramatic ?
were you at that table just now ?
yes , i was .
you took what your father said the wrong way .
the wrong way ?
how could i have taken it the wrong way ?
what was open to interpretation ?
keep your voice down .
no , mother .
i can' t take it anymore .
tonight has been like a nightmare .
you' re dripping all over the floor .
why do you pounce on every single thing i say ?
that' s absurd .
you' ve barely uttered a word all night .
that' s not true .
you said " pie .
come on .
you did .
all i heard you say was " pie .
why bring up christopher ?
was that really necessary ?
he likes christopher .
isn' t that interesting ?
because , as i remember , when christopher got me pregnant ...
dad didn' t like him so much .
you were 16 .
what were we supposed to do , throw you a party ?
we were disappointed .
the two of you had such bright futures .
yes .
and by not getting married , we got to keep those bright futures .
when you get pregnant , you get married .
a child needs a mother and a father .
do you think christopher would have his own company now ... if we were married ?
you think he' d be anything at all ?
yes , i do .
your father would' ve put him ... in the insurance business , and you' d be living a lovely life right now .
he didn' t want to be in the insurance business .
and i am living a lovely life right now .
that' s right .
far away from us .
here we go .
you took that girl and completely shut us out of your life .
you wanted to control me .
you were still a child .
i stopped being a child the minute the strip turned pink , okay ?
i had to figure out how to live .
i found a good job .
as a maid .
with all your brains and talent .
i worked my way up .
i run the place now .
i built a life on my own with no help from anyone .
yes , and think of where you would' ve been if you' d accepted a little help .
and where rory would have been ?
but no , you were always too proud to accept anything from anyone .
i wasn' t too proud to come here to you two ... begging for money for my kid' s school , was i ?
no , you certainly weren' t .
but you' re too proud to let her know where you got it from , aren' t you ?
fine , you have your precious pride , and i have my weekly dinners .
isn' t that nice ?
we both win .
mom ?
i' m okay .
i just ...
do i look shorter ?
because i feel shorter .
how about i buy you a cup of coffee ?
you drive , though , ' cause i don' t think my feet will reach the pedals .
nice dinner at the grandparents ' house .
yeah .
her dishes have never been cleaner .
you and grandma seemed to have a nice talk .
how much did you hear ?
not much .
snippets .
little snippets .
so basically everything ?
basically , yes .
the best laid plans .
i think it was really brave of you to ask them for money .
i so do not want to talk about it .
how many meals is it gonna take till we' re off the hook ?
i think the deli spread at my funeral will be the last one .
wait , does that mean ...
can' t let a perfectly good plaid skirt go to waste .
honey , you won' t be sorry .
you look nice .
really nice .
i had a meeting earlier at the bank .
they like collars .
you look nice , too .
i had a flagellation to go to .
what' il you have ?
coffee , in a vat .
i' il have coffee also .
and chili fries .
that' s quite a refined palate you got there .
behold the healing powers of a bath .
tell me about the guy .
you know what' s really special about our relationship ?
the total understanding about the need for one' s privacy .
you really understand boundaries .
so tell me about the guy .

that' s so nick at nite .
i' m gonna find out anyway .
really ?
how ?
i' il spy .
coffee .
fries .
i can' t stand it .

rory , please , put down that cup of coffee .
you do not want to grow up to be like your mom .
sorry .
too late .
