are you kathy nicolo ?
yeah .
is this your house ?
nadi , of course , agreed that it was a wonderful idea to cut down the trees at our home on the caspian , to have the sea spread before us , to reach infinity with our eyes , to see forever .
but then , our life went the way of the trees when the ayatollahs ripped the soul out of our beautiful country .
well , enough .
today is not a day for the old .
it is a day for the young .
to the future .
to our soraya .
may she be a happy wife as she is a bride .
and , perhaps , she will not forget her poor mother and father so soon and return to us and give to us many little grandbabies .
a father can dream .
he' s so tan .
retirement has been good to the colonel .
he' s not .
he works for boeing .
he doesn' t work for boeing .
my son works for boeing .
who knows what he does now ?
i love you
es todo .
terminamos .
hello .
kathy ?
what time is it ?
it' s , um , 9 : 00 .
mom , it' s 6 : 00 a . m . here .
i don' t think 6 : 00 a . m . will kill you .
your father got up at 4 : 30 every day of his life ,
god bless his soul .
so , how' s it going ?
how' s the program ?
fine .
i' m fine .
one day at a time , right ?
i just hope it' s working .
how' s everyone there ?
frankie' s good .
salesman of the month again .
you know your brother .
his lisa' s in her seventh month .
wow .
how' s your better half ?
fine .
he' s right here .
he' s sleeping .
sleeping ?
hmm .
mom , i' m really tired .
i' m gonna go , okay ?
listen .
i almost forgot .
your aunt frances won a trip to reno .
we' re gonna come out on the 18th .
i thought we' d stop by .
the 18th ?
yeah .
two weeks .
yeah , okay .
um , nick' s gonna be away on business , though .
again ?
yeah .
wow .
i' m gonna go , okay , mom ?
you' re still not smoking , right ?
bye .
' cause they say it' s a slippery ...
just a second !
you kathy lazaro ?
yeah .
why ?
due to the nonpayment of business taxes associated with this property , the county has petitioned the court on its behalf to reclaim these costs .
it should come as no surprise to you .
i' m sure you' ve had ample warning .
we' ve sent many notices .
now the house is up for auction tomorrow morning .
auction ?
what are you talking about ?
are you out of your mind ?
there' s no smoking in my house .
hey , chuck .
' cause i see your number right here .
yeah .
we gonna meet down there ?
supposed to be a hot one today .
i' d dress lightly if i were you .
it' s okay , ' cause i' m not leaving .
i' m afraid you have no choice , mrs. lazaro .
all of your things will be auctioned off with the property .
do you want that ?
look , you can' t evict me .
i never owed a fucking business tax .
it doesn' t make sense .
okay , well , this is where i get off .
deputy sheriff burdon will assist you in vacating the property .
do you have a lawyer ?
i can' t afford a lawyer .
i' m a house cleaner .
here' s the number for the legal assistance office .
they may be able to help .
nothing' s written in blood .
you just have to clear out today .
you might be moving back in next week .
in the meantime , maybe you can call some friends or family .
stay with them .
there' s no one to call .
i' il tell you what .
i know some movers that owe me a favor .
brian .
go down to safeway and get some boxes .
let' s help this lady pack up .
lester .
may i help you ?
my car is parked here .
you asked yesterday also .
oh , oh , what happened to you ?
i fell .
again ?
yeah .
wash up .
do not get blood on the floor .
the house was repossessed for tax payment delinquency .
it' s got three bedrooms , one bath .
a widow' s walk would increase property value .
what is this " widow' s walk " ?
a deck on top of the house so you can see the ocean .
we still got time here .
feel free to look around .
nadereh .
today god has kissed our eyes .
do you remember our bungalow on the caspian , how i ordered the trees cut down on the west side so we may view the sea ?
please , be quiet .
do you remember how the general brought his family there for new year , how beautiful it was ?
what is the matter for you today , behrani ?
nadi ?
i today have bought for us another bungalow .
i purchased this home for a price no one would believe .
it is worth two , maybe three times that .
we will live in this home for a short while and then sell it and find one even better .
nah !
nah !
perhaps you did not come here to live like a gypsy .
but i did not come here to work like an arab ... to be treated like an arab .
for four years we have lived a life we could not afford and spent almost everything to marry soraya with a good family .
this apartment alone has cost us over $140, 000 in rent .
and what of esmail' s university education ?
soon we will have nothing .
and then you will see what it is like to walk in the shoes of the gypsies .
so ... tomorrow , you will begin packing , and there' s no more to discuss .
do not open your lips .
$500 ?
they evicted you from your house for that ?
you got it .
um , are you staying with friends ?
yeah , i' m with a friend .
how much is this gonna cost me ?
it' s on a sliding scale .
um , how come you didn' t do something about this earlier ?
i did .
i went to the courthouse , months ago , and i signed a statement saying that i never owed a business tax because i never owned a business .
i even had it certified .
and what about the follow up mail ?
i didn' t open it .
it' s very important to me that i get my house back by the 18th .
i' m expecting company .
when did you sign that letter ?
i don' t know .
march ?
well , i hate to be the bearer of bad news , but the county' s already sold your house .
what ?
no .
they can' t do that .
the auction date' s been set for months .
don' t worry .
they' il rescind the sale , or we' il file a lawsuit against the county .
we' il get your house back .
before the 18th , right ?
it' s possible .
fuck .
hello .
sorry .
shit .
i didn' t mean to scare you .
don' t do that .
you all right ?
yeah .
i' m fine .
you ?
good .
good .
you working undercover or something ?
excuse me ?
no .
i' m off .
i just ...
i drive by this way , and , uh ... figured i' d check in on you , see how you' re holding up .
they already sold your house ?
technically , it' s mine and my brother' s .
my dad left it to us when he died .
i haven' t told my family .
my lawyer' s trying to get them to rescind it .
so i' m trying not to harp on the negative .
you have any kids , mr. burdon ?
two .
call me lester .
my husband left me eight months ago .
no one knows that , either .
do you mind if i give you some professional advice ?
no .
do it all through your lawyer , kathy .
i wouldn' t drive past that house till the keys were back in my hand .
thanks for checking in on me .
sure .
night .
hey , kathy , wait .
listen .
this is my direct number at the department .
most of the time , i' m on patrol .
but if you ever need anything , anything at all , just leave a message .
see ya .
good night .
it is like our garden in lsfahan .
hello ?
hello ?
yeah ?
your credit card didn' t go through .
that' s two days now .
god , i' m really sorry about that .
look , um , i' m gonna get my paycheck on friday .
is there any way we can let it slide until then ?
the only affordable way to put a terrace up there is to put the stairs on the outside .
it' il have to block that kitchen window .
i could do that for about a grand .
i could do that for about a grand .
if we have to go through the roof , about $4, 000 to $7, 000 .
but this window must be obstructed ?
i don' t see any other way .
that is acceptable .
can you start today ?
hey !
hey !
what are you doing ?
excuse me ?
what the fuck are you doing ?
this is my house .
who are you ?
this is my house .
who said you could do this ?
are you mrs. behrani ?
no .
mr. behrani hired us .
you' re gonna have to talk to him .
oh , fuck .
whoa , lady .
shit .
damn !
stay right there .
don' t move .
hold on .
ah ! oh , man .
let' s get her inside .
fuck .
come on .
careful .
could we use your bathroom ?
she stepped on ...
sorry , ma' am .
could we use your washroom to clean her foot ?
okay .
it is okay .
for one moment , please .
here .
i got it .
here you go .
thanks .
have you had a tetanus shot lately ?
i' m gonna be sick .
is she bleeding ?
excuse me .
esmail , a bandage . okay .
i don' t want to ruin your towel .
here .
i use this for skateboarding .
don' t worry .
i washed it .
okay .
this is , of course , our family pictures .
thank you .
i think i should go .
what happened ?
i' il tell you what happened .
my yard is a construction site .
you were there ?
yeah , i was there .
i was at my house .
i stepped on some nails .
i was bleeding on my own doorstep , waiting for a stranger to open my door .
you can' t just go over there .
you' ve got to let us handle this .
i want them out of my house .
they' re already more at home there than i ever was .
did you get their name ?
ah ...
bahroony ?
behmini , something like that .
they' re middle eastern .
gary ?
yes , connie ?
will you type a letter to the courier service and make sure that it gets to a mr. behrmini ?
it' s damn hard to sell a house nowadays .
this is what you call a real buyer' s market .
well , sorry , but she comes in at ... $174, 000 .
you' re late , behrani .
i am not late .
i have come to tell you that i' m no longer to return to this job .
you tell the office , colonel ?
no .
so why tell me , man ?
is this you ?
hmm .
... inform you ... that under these circumstances ... " currently owe , or as a property ...
we request that you vacate the property immediately .
mother whores !
goddamn it !
mr. barmeeny is here .
oh , mr. barmeeny .
my name is behrani .
colonel massoud amir behrani .
i wish to speak with mr. walsh , please .
i' m connie walsh .
this is my office , colonel .
please come in .
i' m sure our letter came as a shock to you , colonel .
pacific county has made a number of mistakes .
first , they levied a tax on my client which she did not owe .
second , they evicted her for nonpayment .
and third , they auctioned the property .
unfortunately , this is where you come in .
but i now own the house .
i paid for it in cash .
i have a bill of sale .
here , please .
would you sell the county back the house ?
they would make it as comfortable a transaction as possible .
please listen to me very carefully .
the only comfortable transaction possible is if the county tax office paid to me $174, 000 .
mr. behrani , you only paid a quarter of that amount .
the market can already pay me this .
good morning , miss walsh .
wait , please .
from a legal standpoint , you are in the right .
but the true owner of this house is living in a motel , mr. behrani .
all her belongings are locked in storage .
why should she wait to get back into her home that was wrongfully taken ?
just because you want to turn a profit .
things are not as they appear .
it is a matter of necessity for me and my family .
i' m sorry .
i do not have a choice in this matter .
hey .
this is a surprise .
good one or a bad one ?
it' s good .
it' s good .
what happened to your foot ? oh , i , um ...
i stopped by my house , and they were doing construction on the roof .
i stepped on some nails .
thanks for letting me ride along today , mr. burdon .
so , how' s the el rancho ?
i' m not there anymore .
i' m staying at the bonneville now .
i don' t know it .
you' re looking at it .
i haven' t had a drink in three years , lester . oh , i' m sorry .
i ...
i should have asked .
i didn' t know .
no , it' s okay .
the fog' s coming in .
i' d like to ask you a personal question , if i could . okay .
just get it over with .
why is your husband no longer with you ?
i wanted kids .
he didn' t want kids .
but i guess if he really wanted me , he would have wanted them , too .
i think he' s a fool .
maybe we should find you a place to stay .
do you remember the beauty of the caspian sea , esmail ?
the water like glass .
the beach sand like gold .
it is beautiful here .
massoud , when must we move again ?
not too soon .
perhaps once we get a buyer , we will tell them to wait until autumn .
would you prefer that ?
i will do as you wish .
there was this little runt of a guy .
kept beating up his wife .
except she wouldn' t press charges .
we' d show up , and there they' d be at the door
like romeo and juliet , arm in arm .
she had welts and bruises all over .
so , one night we get called out there again , and i slipped down their hallway and stuffed two eight balls in his closet .
turns out he was on parole .
he goes back to jail , she' s safe , and i slept like a baby .
did i just lose you ?
no .
i' m sorry .
i , um ...
to tell you the truth , i think the wine' s distracting me .
i' il send it back .
no , it' s fine .
you sure ?
yeah .
see , when i think of my sobriety , i don' t think about wine .
alcohol was never a problem .
well , you' re a grown woman .
cheers .
what are your kids ' names ?
nate and bethany .
nate is four .
bethany is nine .
where is your house ?
in millbrae .
in a housing development called palomino meadows .
you have to drive through it to get to the mall .
yeah , i know where that is .
god , i' ve probably driven by it a dozen times .
i' ve probably even seen your wife .
carol .
yeah .
carol .
what' s your situation , les ?
i married my best friend .
and for seven of the last nine years ,
i haven' t wanted to give her more than a hug or a peck on the cheek .
that' s my situation .
what about her ?
it' s not the same for her .
do you want to come inside ?
massoud .
we are blessed .
what time is it ?
it' s 10 : 00 . oh , god .
i should have been home hours ago .
i' m sure carol called the department .
i' m sure they asked her if i was feeling any better .
things are finally in motion .
i' m finally gonna get it over with .
it ?
telling her the truth about how i feel .
how do you feel ?
i feel found .
well , kathy , bad news .
the county' s done their part , but the new owner won' t go along .
he' s asking for four times what he bought it for .
we can sue the county , but it' il take months .
do you mean that ...
i can' t legally get my house back ?
it would' ve been a lot easier if you' d just opened your mail .
you can' t expect the law to work miracles .
i don' t expect miracles .
i expect you to do your fucking job .
i don' t know what i' m doing sitting here talking to you .
and as you see , very excellent rooms .
it is cool inside , even during the day .
and from the widow' s walk , sunsets are quite beautiful .
there is very little fog in this area .
when would the house be available ?
not until autumn .
we would need time to find a new home .
that might work for us .
yes .
she has come for a tool her boyfriend carpenter may have left behind .
i have been expecting her . one moment , please .
i am happy you came .
please , this way .
i will show you .
my family knows nothing of this .
i' d like for it to remain so .
you have me confused with someone else .
i' m quite certain i know who you are .
i' m kathy nicolo .
i know my lawyer talked to you , mr. bahrooni ,
but i thought we could meet face to face .
my name is behrani .
colonel behrani .
colonel behrani , i' m sorry .
my father left this house to me and my brother .
tell this to the bureaucrats at the county tax office .
they have made a mistake , not i.
they said they' d give you your money back .
you' ve put that deck on .
i' m sure they' d repay you for that .
i' m sorry , but i' ve nothing more to say .
why should i be penalized for their incompetence ?
you should sue them for enough to buy ten homes .
i' il even sell you this house for the right price .
that' s all i require .
i don' t know where he left his hammers .
i' ve nothing more to say .
let go of me .
you can' t expect to just move in here and make money off of this .
this is my house .
i lived here , and you stole this house from me , you son of a bitch !
this is a stolen house !
he' s trying to sell you a stolen house !
what' d you tell your kids ?
i told them the truth .
my old man walked out on us .
i swore i would never do that to my own .
what happened ?
my lawyer couldn' t get the house back .
so i went to see the owner .
and he put his hand on you ?
it' s okay .
don' t worry about it .
that' s not right .
he' s got no right to do that .
who is this guy ?
his name' s behrani .
he' s a colonel .
behrani ?
what country is he from ?
i don' t know .
but his wife hardly speaks any english .
maybe they haven' t been here that long .
maybe they don' t know their way around .
what are you doing ?
i' m gonna pay ' em a visit .
officers tend to listen to other officers .
it' s worth a shot .
what if he doesn' t listen ?
then i' il make him listen .
oomadan !
oomadan !
little bird .
little bird !
little bird !
welcome to our new home .
does it go down the hill ?
it is an investment property , soraya .
like our second home on the caspian .
it' s an investment home .
let us go to the roof porch , for the view .
jesus , look at them .
what are they celebrating , stealing a woman' s house ?
fuck these people .
you' re a very wise man , genob sarhang , to live in such a place that gives you a view of god' s wonders .
did you post that sign , sir ?
yes .
is there a difficulty , officer ?
and that' s your sign at the bottom of the hill ?
yes .
please , come in , officer .
