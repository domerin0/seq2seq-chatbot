are we still partners ?
we' ve been business partners for nearly three years .
this is the first time we' ve ever sat together .
we hardly ever see each other .
i know how hard it is for a man to control his passion .
partners shouldn' t get emotionally involved with each other .
fallen angels
paging 3662 .
i' d like to leave a message .
i' il meet his friends tomorrow .
where and when ?
most people work from 9 to 5 .
i' m the opposite .
my job is simple .
i visit friends now and again .
i don' t know any of these people .
they don' t interest me , either .
soon , they' il be history .
going out ?
yes .
one' s profession is very often determined by one' s personality .
i love my job ... no decision making .
like who' s to die , where and when is all planned by others .
i' m a lazy person .
i like others to arrange things for me .
that' s why i need a partner .
ming ?
ming
it is ming , isn' t it ?
remember me ?
i' m hoi .
remember ?
we were in the same class at junior high
yes ...
what a coincidence
if my merc hadn' t broken down .
we wouldn' t have met
everyone has a past .
even an assassin once had classmates at junior high .
whenever i bump into old pals ... ... they always ask the same old questions .
what do you do for a living ?
got a card ?
we must keep in touch
let' s arrange something .
what d' you think ?
as long as there' s money to make ...
you run your own business ?
are you married ?
don' t tell me you' re still single ?
hey a son he looks exactly like you
you' re telling me ...
your wife' s a nigger , eh ?
you' re very liberal .
blacks ...
they' re beautiful .
colour doesn' t matter , does it ?
you really look like a couple .
say , are you insured ?
think about it .
i' m a pro .
insurance is my business .
you know , i' ve been crowned ' king of the brokers ... ... in southeast asia .
tlme are doing an interview with me in the next few days .
look , for old time' s sake ... ... i' il work out a decent plan for you .
you may not want to hear this ... ... but accidents happen , your family needs protection .
your job involves travel .
you must think of your family unit .
would an insurance company ... ... underwrite a professional killer , i wonder ?
i' d love to take up his offer ... but who do i name as beneficiary ?
remember the big bosom ?
the one we both fancied ?
we' re getting married next week .
here' s an invitation card .
just fill in you name , okay ?
please come , and i' il have the insurance ready for you .
bring your wife along , too .
see you
ages ago i paid a black woman $30 to pose with me for a photo .
whenever people asked i' d say she' s my wife .
and the kid in the picture ?
i think i bought him an ice cream .
i always wanted to go to a wedding reception .
but i know it' s not my scene .
sifting through a man' s rubbish ... ... one can easily find clues as to his background .
he visits this bar a lot .
likes the laid back atmosphere .
i always sit at the same table he sat at .
makes me feel sort of closer to him .
there are some people you can never get close to .
get too close , and you' il find him boring .
i' m someone who plays by the rules .
i know how to be easygoing .
no , he hasn' t come home .
you' re telling the truth ?
why should i lie ?
you live here ?
of course .
ever seen this person ?
no .
keep out of sight .
the cops are still outside .
where is your son ?
we rub shoulders with people every day .
strangers who may even become friends or confidants .
one thing i do know these cops will never be my friends .
my name' s he qiwu .
my prison number was 223 .
i haven' t seen him for days .
i' il inform you when he returns .
i saw him come in .
i want the truth
that' s enough keep still
i' m a very happy man .
i was very talkative when i was small .
but since eating an out of date can of pineapple when i was five ... ... i lost my voice .
for this reason .
i have very few friends .
i also found it difficult to find a job .
so i finally decided to be my own boss .
having no capital , my only option ... ... was to enter shops after hours and run my business that way .
i don' t mean to take advantage , but it' s practical ... to run an all night business .
customers do come in at 3 a . m .
to buy meat .
business is business .
always satisfy the needs of your customer .
' the customer is always right ' .
and as the boss , i must be kind , caring and tolerant .
one can' t afford to be selfish ... ... there' s no such thing as a free lunch in this world .
i always work very hard at night well , until very late .
i don' t make a fortune , but i' m happy .
are you crazy ?
why are you making me wash my clothes ?
i' m a beggar the last thing i need is a laundry
leave me alone ...
you are crazy get your hands off my clothes
sod off i' il smash you to pulp
okay , i' il pay you ... if it' s money you want
cretin
leave it i don' t want an aubergine
no , i don' t want them i must act like a lady .
i don' t accept freebies from strangers .
people will talk
i' il have a melon , okay ?
here
what the hell you crazy or something ?
stop that
listen , i washed my hair yesterday ...
ouch take it easy ...
don' t scratch
i just want a late snack .
i don' t need a shampoo
okay , you win .
do what you like
no
i don' t want a shave
don' t touch me ...
listen , i know i' m difficult , but i know some ... ... who aren' t
please don' t shave me ...
i don' t want a shave ...
i' il pay you not to , okay ?
thanks .
a double cone , please .
fuck it' s you
i' m sorry ... sorry ...
stop pulling my hair , okay ?
i' il serve myself .
i' il do it .
hi , it' s me .
what are you doing ?
go to bed , don' t wait up .
i' m having some ice cream .
i hope i can come home soon .
i don' t know how much more i' il have to eat .
of course i' il have to pay
look , i' ve run into this guy , and ...
what' s to explain ?
it' s the truth
come down and see for yourself .
hey
oh , no way i can' t eat that
it' il burn my moustache .
this is beyond a joke ...
what the hell' s going on ?
i said come by yourself .
i didn' t say bring dad and the kids
too much ice cream' s bad for dad .
what if something happens ?
and the kids have school tomorrow .
what' s that ... ?
i don' t want to die from eating too much ice cream .
look , i' m being serious .
i' il pay you , okay ?
tell me how much , and i' il buy all the ice cream .
go on .
my ice cream maybe a bit more expensive ... ... but i think this family' s having a great time tonight .
i love ice cream .
when i was a kid ... ... an ice cream van always stopped outside our place .
every time i saw it .
i was happy .
i even asked my dad why he didn' t drive an ice cream van .
he didn' t answer me .
i later found out ... ... that my mum was killed by an ice cream van .
i was born in taiwan ... ... and came to hong kong with dad when i was five .
he worked as an assistant in chungking mansions .
after my mum' s death .
he very rarely talked .
and we never ate ice cream .
the fact that we' re both quiet and subtle ... ... probably explains the close bond between us .
what are you thinking of ?
and why the ice cream ?
you know i don' t like ice cream .
it' s too cold ... ... and it gives me the runs .
you' re crazy
let me out what are you playing at ?
what are you doing ?
i' il kill you
open this door you hear ?
paging 9090 .
i' d like to leave a message .
i' il meet his friends tomorrow .
let me know where and when .
it' s crystal clear ... crystal clear ...
i just want to check that i' ve got the right place .
it' s a fast food store , not a barber shop .
you may think that we' re making a lot of money .
what price a human life ?
depends on your luck .
business can be slack for ages .
so , to make a living ... ... i' il occasionally invest in other businesses .
like debt collection .
thanks .
hold on .
i' il get your money .
here .
but lately .
i' ve suffered quite a few injuries .
i hate digging bullets out of my own body .
it' s very exhausting .
i went to bed early that night .
when i awoke next morning , i came to a decision .
lady , we' re closed .
two weeks after i was injured , i asked her out .
i wanted to tell her my decision .
but ...
i didn' t show up .
i' m sure she' il come looking for me in a couple of days .
after all , we' ve been partners for a long time .
being partners , you get to understand each other .
almost able to read each other' s minds .
i' d often leave her some clues ... ... to trace my actions , or my whereabouts .
after all these years .
she' s become part of my life .
but nothing can remain the same forever .
i have to tell her that i desperately want out .
but i don' t know how to start .
so , i' ve devised another method .
a woman may come in asking for me .
please give her this coin ... ... and tell her that 1818 is my lucky number .
1818 ... it' s the code for one of the songs in this jukebox .
after she' s listened to the song . ... she' il understand my message .
okay if i sit here ?
it' s raining
let' s have some fun oh , it feels so great
come on
why ?
perhaps i' m tense ...
why ?
you coming ?
no ?
okay
sure you don' t want to come ?
made up your mind ?
forget it
hey ... come and get it
it' s not drying .
i' il take it to the cleaners for you tomorrow .

open the door
hmm , nice .

i don' t know .
so no one will forget me .

you' re making fun of me .
no , you' re very special .
i' ve heard it all before .
from whom ?
you
we were together for some time .
i had long hair .
you called me ' baby ' .
really ?
yes .
let bygones be bygones .
you like me now , that' s fine .
i didn' t say that .
i want some female company .
fine .
just for the night .
maybe you' il like me better in the morning .
get out on your way
get the hell out of here
hello ?

you want to have kids ?
what' s all this crap ?
you want to get married ?

i need a shoulder to cry on
the night' s full of weirdos .
this one seems to turn up wherever i go .
i' m fine now .
i' il pay you back next time i see you .
same old story .
i wish i could tell her ... ... you can' t solve problems over the phone .
you have to talk , face to face .
it that fails , you can punch him on the nose .
i keep my thoughts to myself .
but somehow , she appears to be able to read my mind .
i think you' re right .
let' s go .
blondie , i know you' re there come out if you' ve got the guts
we' re gonna torch the place on the count of three .
one , two , three
wrong floor
blondie come on out 3 seconds and you burn one , two , three
let' s try the next floor .
is that a wig ?
no way , it comes with age
looks blond , not grey .
you related to blondie ?
i don' t know any blondie .
her nickname' s ' stowaway ' well ?
funny name is she your chick ?
leave me alone , you loonies
pervert follow her ...
is blondie your daughter ?
no .
i can see a resemblance .
you' ve forgotten her ?
think hard leave it
we searched high and low all night .
i don' t think she knows where this blondie lives .
i give up .
everyone protects her , hides her away .
where the hell is she ?
why won' t anyone help me ?
the slut
it' s not fair what kind of game is this ?
i' m not playing anymore
you must have slept with her .
i bet you have , but you won' t admit it .
right ?
you on vacation ?
think the whole world' s on your side , bitch ?
blondie
you slut you dare show your face ?
you' re finished
you bitch slut tramp
fuck you you bitch
where does all this energy come from ?
stop eating watch the door .
blondie could show up any minute now .
she comes here with her dad .
how do you spell ' blondie ' ?
oh , what the hell ...
listen to this .
i , blondie , a . k . a .
stowaway , behaved in an ugly & shameless way .
i' m returning johnny kwong to his rightful girlfriend charlie young .
i hereby terminate all relations with him .
our signatures binding until death .
great .
you think so ?
i' il make blondie sign this .
must get her fingerprints and i. d. number on it .
get her dad as a witness .
photograph them together .
blondie ?
you' re blondie ?
you' re blondie ?
yeah , so what ?
hey , you blondie ?
i' il fucking chop you into little pieces
they say women are made of water .
so are some men .
most folk experience first love in their teens .
i was a bit older .
maybe i' m too choosy .
on may 30th , 1995 ... ... i fell in love for the first time .
it was raining that night .
i looked at her ... ... and had this feeling like i was a store . ... and that she was me .
without any warning , she suddenly enters the store .
i don' t know how long she' il stay the longer the better , of course .
when did you last wash ?
you need a bath .
huh ?
you stink all over
when did you dye your hair ?
they say love can change a man .
i find myself looking handsome and becoming more charming .
suddenly , i discover my hair' s turning blond .
perhaps it' s because my mum was russian .
dad speaks in a taiwanese dialect ... ... which no on can understand ... ... because of his strong russian accent .
hello ?
chungking mansions .
who' s speaking ?
blondie ?
on june 22nd , 1995 ... ... the italian team sampdoria came to play in hong kong .
i took charlie to the match .
she' s a fan of ruud gullit .
she was ecstatic that night .
she insisted in staying on after the game .
it' s not right what was the point of playing ?
they had the better team .
our boys were outclassed
there' s no miracles in this world .
fat chance
do you know why i came ?
i was actually hoping for a miracle .
johnny' s a great fan of gullit .
i thought he would come .
he wouldn' t have had time .
he' s getting married tomorrow .
guess why i was yelling and waving ... ... and acting crazy earlier ?
i hoped he' d see me on tv .
he promised me he' d come so why didn' t he ?
i realise that she still misses johnny , but it hurts me .
but i' m an optimistic person .
it' s said ... ... nothing remains the same forever .
but will it apply to johnny and charlie ?
time will tell .
i suppose .
perhaps i' m being a bit too optimistic .
a few days later , i invited her to another match .
she didn' t turn up .
i really thought she' d soon get over johnny .
how wrong could i have been ?
it was me she got over .
i stayed on after the match .
as the stadium lights dimmed .
i realised she wouldn' t show .
i' m heartbroken .
not a hope
they say ' love hurts ' ... ... but it' s different with me .
something strange happens .
my hair changes colour .
just like with my first love .
i also realised how irresponsible i had been in the past .
i shouldn' t have taken over other people' s shops ... ... the way i did .
every shop must have its own feeling .
this realisation cheered me up and prompted me ... ... to change my life .
welcome .
just for one .
we' il have a new menu next time you come .
am i keeping you ?
get a glass .
be my guest .
how' s business ?
what' s it cost to set up a place like this ?
hi , there .
you interested in a business ?
just wondered how much a place like this cost .
at least a million .
when you live out of a suitcase ... ... you don' t need a place of your own .
things have changed , though .
got to start planning ahead .
i had a good chat that evening .
he even offered to help me ... ... if i started up my own place .
another beer ?
why not ?
what are you really worth ?
i' d stayed away from the bar for some time .
i couldn' t bear hearing that song .
but some things you can' t escape from .
so , after that evening , i never went back .
happy birthday to you
happy birthday to you
happy birthday to you
happy birthday , happy birthday
happy birthday to you
okay ?
good .
how are you ?
dad' s fine .
no need to worry .
i know it' s your birthday soon .
sorry i can' t be with you .
is mum feeling better now ?
is your sister okay ?
doing well at school ?
how was that ?
sato san loves his family very much .
before his present job he used to be a film director .
so whenever he has family business to talk about ... ... he just makes a video recording .
i' m sure his son gets great pleasure in receiving the tapes .
i' d like to do the same ... ... but who would i send the tapes to ?
i can' t really send them to myself .
maybe i could be like sato san' s son ... ... and imagine the happiness he gets from the tapes .
how much for a double room ?
with twin beds ?
yes ...
twin room four fifty .
too damned expensive .
you' ve got to be kidding .
forget it
calm down ...
stop filming go to bed
that' s enough go on , get out of here
later that night ... ... i caught dad having a sneak look at the tape .
he really enjoyed it .
my memory' s not that good .
but ... ... i did remember that it was his 60th birthday .
god knows why .
but he gets great amusement watching it .
and i do know that he' s happy .
silly devil ...
working with someone for a long time ... ... you' re bound to be influenced in some way .
i know that fragrance ... ... but i' m not used to smelling it on other women .
this suits me just fine .
it' s shrunk a bit , though .
i always thought the perfume was a bit overpowering .
i smelt it on this other woman this afternoon .
she wants to see you .
i fixed up a meeting .
will you go ?
i think you should go and get things sorted out .
perhaps it' s not such a good idea .
anyway , i thought you' d go .
this is for you .
i' d like ... ... a packet of crisps .
not the red pack , the yellow
they sit there together for ages .
i wonder what they' re talking about ?
meanwhile the rain keeps bucketing down .
it' s raining so heavily , how will i get home by myself ?
and just when i need a raincoat ... ... he appears at my side .
i hope the rain ... ... will never stop .
i' m not coming in .
then why walk me home ?
you could' ve let me walk
i was going to do that anyway .
you trying to be funny ?
oh , what the hell just fuck off , will you ?
we came to an agreement .
i never agreed anything
you insisted on seeing her , not me what d' you want from me now ?
you think i' m stupid ?
oh , get lost
you' re a cheat and a liar
give me your hand ...
why ?
i' ve left my mark , okay ?
you may forget my face , but you won' t forget my bite
i' m easily recognised , though ... ... by the mole on my face .
if a woman with a mole on her face ever comes up to you ... ... it could be me .
will you remember that ?
i' il remember .
will i remember her ?
actually , it' s not important .
for her i was an oasis in her journey through life .
i hope she soon reaches her destination ... ... and finds her soulmate for life .
we all need a partner .
when will i find mine ?
are we still partners ?
i don' t know how to answer her question .
i' ve come to look at partners from a new angle .
as a business partner , she' s perfect ... ... but not one you could spend your life with .
i' m terminating our business relationship .
do me one last favour , will you ?
i don' t know why i agreed .
probably because it' s a last favour .
i want to place an advert for my friend .
i want the front page .
the best thing about my job i don' t have to make decisions .
who' s to die , when and where , it' s all been planned by others .
i' m a lazy person .
i like others to arrange things for me .
but i' ve been doing some thinking lately .
i feel the need for change .
whether it' s right or wrong ... ... i must make a decision for myself .
' being photographed will shorten your life ' .
seems there' s some truth in it .
one evening , dad was taken ill .
i took him to hospital .
a little later , he passed away .
thanks to him , all my life ... ... i' ve always felt like a little boy .
he was always there to sort out my problems .
packing his things away that evening ...
he was always there to sort out my problems .
packing his things away that evening ... ... i felt grown up for the first time .
i didn' t want to be grown up ... ... i just wanted dad with me .
when i left the hotel ... ... i took the videotapes with me .
i watched them over and over again .
watching dad cooking made me very happy .
i know i' il never taste his steaks again ... ... but i' il never forget just how they tasted .
oh , hell , it' s you again
not the hair leave it ...
i' m happy to be your client .
did i ever refuse ?
i didn' t , did i ?
just look at me let go of me ...
my wife' s visiting china ... ... and i' ve some business to attend to .
give me three hours and i' il be back .
three hours , okay ?
three hours ...
two hours ?
two hours and i' il be back .
deal ?
trust me .
we' re old friends , aren' t we ?
people cross all the time .
two hours ...
trust me , you have my word we' re like brothers , right ?
you want it written in blood ?
you' re kidding , right ?
leave it out ...
just one hour , okay ?
don' t do this ... have mercy ...
wait ...
can i have some small change , please ?
thanks .
i' m downstairs already .
i' m waiting for you .
' bye .
talk about bad timing ...
shortly after dad died , sato san returned to japan .
i haven' t got much money saved ... ... so i can only do what i' m best at being my own boss .
i' m being very cautious this time .
i pick only the stronger ones .
ones that won' t get hurt easily .
take this one for example .
guts of steel .
saves a lot of hassle .
sometimes i run into old acquaintances .
some haven' t changed at all .
others i hardly recognise .
i' m always glad to see them ... ... even though they may not remember me .
of course , there are some exceptions to the rule .
on august 29th , 1995 ... ... i ran into my first love again .
i don' t think she recognised me .
i guess i' m more handsome now .
you' re late .
sorry .
what' s up with him ?
i' ve no idea .
it turned quite cold that evening .
i hadn' t expected winter to come so soon .
i' m not used to this kind of weather .
it seems to have been a long winter .
although i eat well every day ... ... i still feel cold .
i' ve got used to working alone .
occasionally i do work with others ... ... but not on a regular basis .
i' ve learnt to be more careful .
for instance , i won' t work in hotels any more .
and no more checking out rubbish bins .
i firmly believe ... ... one mustn' t get emotionally involved with one' s partner .
we rub shoulders with many people every day .
some may become close friends , or confidants .
that' s why i' m always optimistic .
sometimes it hurts .
not to worry i try to stay happy .
that night , i saw that woman again .
i knew we' d never be friends or confidants ... ... we' d let too many chances pass us by .
nothing happened , there was no chemistry .
maybe it was the weather ... ... but that night i found her very alluring .
i' m about to leave , i ask him to take me home .
i haven' t ridden pillion for a long time ... ... nor have i been this close to a man in ages .
the road home isn' t very long ... ... and i know i' il be getting off soon .
but at this moment , i' m feeling such lovely warmth .
