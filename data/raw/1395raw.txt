oh i come from a land from a faraway place
where the caravan camels roam
where it' s flat and immense and the heat is intense
it' s barbaric , but hey it' s home !
when the wind' s from the east and the sun' s from the west
and the sand in the glass is right
come on down , dance , stop on by
hop a carpet and fly
to another arabian night !
arabian nights
like arabian days
more often than not
are hotter than hot in a lot of good ways
arabian nights ' neath arabian moons
a fool off his guard could fall and fall hard
out there on the dunes .

it once changed the course of a young man' s life .
a young man who liked this lamp was more than what he seemed .
a diamond in the rough .

one whose worth lies far within .
a diamond in the rough .
what are you waiting for ?

i can' t believe it .
i just don' t believe it .
we' re never gonna get a hold of that stupid lamp !
just forget it .
look at this .
look at this .
i' m so ticked off that i' m molting !
patience , iago .
patience .
gazeem was obviously less than worthy .
oh , there' s a big surprise .
that' s an incred i think i' m gonna have a heart attack and die from not surprise !
what' re we gonna do ?
we got a big problem here, a big
yes .
only one may enter .

hello !

one swing ahead of the sword
i steal only what i can' t afford .
that' s everything !
one jump ahead of the lawmen
that' s all , and that' s no joke , these guys don' t appreciate i' m broke !
riffraff !
street rat ! scoundrel !

rip him open , take it back guys !
i can take a hint , gotta face the facts you' re my only friend , abu !

oh , it' s sad aladdin' s hit the bottom
he' s become a one man rise in crime
i' d blame parents , except he hasn' t got ' em !
gotta eat to live, gotta steal to eat , tell you all about it when i got the time !
one jump ahead of the slowpokes one skip ahead of my doom
next time gonna use a nom de plume .
there he is !
one jump ahead of the hitmen one hit ahead of the flock
i think i' il take a stroll around the block .
stop , thief !
vandal !
outrage !
scandal !
let' s not be too hasty
still i think he' s rather tasty
gotta eat to live , gotta steal to eat , otherwise we' d get along !
wrong !
he' s got a sword !
you idiots we' ve all got swords !!
one jump ahead of the hoofbeats !
vandal !
one hop ahead of the hump !

snleno gnojlvo
and now , esteemed effendi , we feast !
all right !
here , go on take it .
on his way to the palace , i suppose .
another suitor for the princess .
out of my way , you filthy brat !
hey , if i were as rich as you , i could afford some manners
oh i teach you some manners !
look at that , abu .
it' s not every day you see a horse with two rear ends !
you are a worthless street rat .
you were born a street rat , you' il die a street rat , and only your fleas will mourn you .
i' m not worthless .
and i don' t have fleas .
come on , abu .
let' s go home .
riffraff , street rat .
i don' t buy that .
if only they' d look closer
would they see a poor boy ?
no siree .
they' d find out , there' s so much more to me .
someday , abu , things are gonna change .
we' il be rich , live in a palace , and never have any problems at all .
i' ve never been so insulted !
oh , prince achmed .
you' re not leaving so soon , are you ?
good luck marrying her off !
oh , jasmine !
jasmine !
jasmine !
confound it , rajah !
so , this is why prince achmed stormed out !
oh , father .
rajah was just playing with him , weren' t you rajah .
you were just playing with that overdressed , self absorbed prince achmed , weren' t you ?
dearest , you' ve got to stop rejecting every suitor that comes to call .
the law says you ... ... must be married to a prince ... ... by your next birthday .
the law is wrong .
you' ve only got three more days !
father , i hate being forced into this .
if i do marry , i want it to be for love .
jasmine , it' s not only this law .
i' m not going to be around forever , ... and i ...
i just want to make sure you' re taken care of , provided for .
please , try to understand .
i' ve never done a thing on my own .
i' ve never had any real friends .
except you , rajah .
i' ve never even been outside the palace walls .
but jasmine , you' re a princess .
then maybe i don' t want to be a princess anymore !
allah forbid you should have any daughters !
i don' t know where she gets it from .
her mother wasn' t nearly so picky .
ah , jafar my most trusted advisor .
i am in desperate need of your wisdom .
my life is but to serve you , my lord .
it' s this suitor business .
jasmine refuses to choose a husband .
i' m at my wit' s end .
wit' s end .
have a cracker , pretty polly !
your majesty certainly has a way with dumb animals .
now then , perhaps i can divine a solution to this thorny problem .
if anyone can help , it' s you .
ah , but it would require the use of the mystic blue diamond .
uh , my ring ?
but it' s been in the family for years .
it is necessary to find the princess a suitor .
don' t worry .
everything will be fine .
everything will be fine .
the diamond .
here , jafar .
whatever you need will be fine .
you are most gracious , my liege .
now run along and play with your little toys .
yes ... that' il be ... pretty good .
i can' t take it anymore !
if i gotta choke down on one more of those moldy , disgusting crackers ... bam !
calm yourself , iago .
then i' d grab him around the head .
soon , i will be sultan , not that addlepated twit .
and then i stuff the crackers down his throat !
oh , i' m sorry , rajah .
but i can' t stay here and have my life lived for me .
i' il miss you .
good bye !
okay , abu .
go !
try this , your taste buds will dance and sing .
hey , get your paws off that .
why , you !
get away from here , you filthy ape !
bye bye !
nice goin ' abu .
breakfast is served .
pretty lady , buy a pot .
no finer pot in brass or silver .
sugar dates , sugar dates and figs !
sugar dates and pistachios !
would the lady like a necklace .
a pretty necklace for a pretty lady .
fresh fish !
we catch ' em , you buy ' em !
i don' t think so .
oh , excuse me .
i' m really very sorry .
oh , you must be hungry .
here you go .
you' d better be able to pay for that .
pay ?
no one steals from my cart !
oh , i' m sorry sir .
i don' t have any money .
thief !
please , if you let me go to the palace , i can get some from the sultan .
do you know what the penalty is for stealing ?
no , no please !
thank you kind sir .
i' m so glad you' ve found her .
i' ve been looking all over for you .
what are you doing ?
just play along .
you know this girl ?
sadly , yes .
she is my sister .
she' s a little crazy .
she said she knows the sultan !
she thinks the monkey is the sultan .
oh , wise sultan .
how may i serve you ?
tragic , isn' t it ?
but , no harm done .
now come along sis .
time to see the doctor .
oh , hello doctor .
how are you ?
no , no , no .
not that one .
come on , sultan .
what is it ?
come back here , you little thieves !
with all due respect , your rottenness , couldn' t we just wait for a real storm ?
save your breath , iago .
faster !
yes , o mighty evil one .
ah , sands of time reveal to me the one who can enter the cave .
yes , yes !
there he is .
my diamond in the rough !
that' s him ? ! ? !
that' s the clown we' ve been waitin ' for ?
let' s have the guards extend him an invitation to the palace , shall we ?
swell .
almost there .
i want to thank you for stopping that man .
uh , forget it .
so , uh , this is your first time in the marketplace , huh ?
is it that obvious ?
well , you do kinda stand out .
i mean , you don' t seem to know how dangerous agrabah can be .
i' m a fast learner .
c' mon , this way .
watch your head there .
be careful .
is this where you live ?
yep .
just me and abu .
come and go as we please .
that sounds fabulous .
well , it' s not much , but it' s got a great view .
palace looks pretty amazing , huh ?
oh , it' s wonderful .
i wonder what it would be like to live there , to have servants and valets ...
oh , sure .
people who tell you where to go and how to dress .
it' s better than here .
always scraping for food and ducking the guards .
you' re not free to make your own choices .
sometimes you feel so
you' re just
trapped .
so , where' re you from ?
what does it matter ?
i ran away , and i am not going back .
really ?
how come ?
my father' s forcing me to get married .
that' s that' s awful .
abu !
what ?
abu says that
that' s not fair .
oh did he ?
yeah , of course .
and does abu have anything else to say ?
well , uh , he wishes there was something he could do to help .
hmm , tell him that' s very sweet .
here you are !
they' ve found me !
they' re after you ?
my father must have sent them
do you trust me ?
what ?
do you trust me ?
yes .
then jump !
we just keep running into each other , don' t we , street rat ?
run !
go !
get out of here !
it' s the dungeon for you , boy .
hey , get off of me !
lethim go !
look what we have here , men a street mouse .
unhand him , by order of the princess .
princess jasmine .
the princess ?
what are you doing outside the palace ?
and with this street rat ?
that' s not your concern .
do as i command .
release him !
well , i would , princess, except my orders come from jafar .
you' il have to take it up with him .
believe me , i will .
jafar ?
oh , uh , princess .
jafar , i' m stuck !
how may i be of service to you ?
the guards just took a boy from the market , on your orders .
your father' s charged me with keeping peace in agrabah .
the boy was a criminal .
what was his crime ?
i can' t breathe , jafar !
why , kidnapping the princess , of course .
if you could just  wow , that hurt !
he didn' t kidnap me !
i ran away !
oh , dear !
oh , how frightfully upsetting .
had i but known .
what do you mean ?
sadly , the boy' s sentence has already been carried out .
what sentence ?
death .
by beheading .
no !
i am exceedingly sorry , princess .
how could you ?
so , how did it go ?
i think she took it ... ... rather well .
it' s all my fault , rajah .
i didn' t even know his name .
she was the princess .
i can' t believe it .
i must have sounded so stupid to her .
abu !
down here !
hey , c' mon help me outta these .
hey , she was in trouble .
ah , she was worth it .
don' t worry , abu .
i' il never see her again .
i' m a street rat , remember , and there' s a law .
she' s gotta marry a prince , she deserves a prince .
i' m a i' m a fool
you' re only a fool if you give up , boy .
who are you ?
a lowly prisoner , like yourself .
but together , perhaps we can be more .
i' m listening .
there is a cave , boy .
a cave of wonders .
filled with treasures beyond your wildest dreams .
treasure enough to impress even your princess , i' d wager .
jafar , can ya hurry it up ?
i' m dyin ' in here !
but the law says that only a prince can
you' ve heard of the golden rule , haven' t you ?
whoever has the gold makes the rules .
so why would you share all of this wonderful treasure with me ?
i need a young pair of legs and a strong back to go in after it .
ah , one problem .
it' s out there , we' re in here ?
things aren' t always what they seem .
so , do we have a deal ?
who disturbs my slumber ?
it is i , aladdin .
proceed .
touch nothing but the lamp .
remember , boy first fetch me the lamp , and then you shall have your reward .
c' mon , abu .

just a handful of this stuff would make me richer than the sultan !
don' t ... touch ... anything !
we gotta find that lamp .
abu , will ya knock it off ?
abu , what are you crazy ?
a magic carpet !
c' mon .
c' mon out .
i' m not gonna hurt you .

jasmine , jafar , now let' s put this whole messy business behind us .

i want them to be good .
what would you wish for ?

no one' s ever asked me that before .
well , in my case , ah , forget it .
what ?
c' mon , tell me .

it' s all part and parcel , the whole genie gig .
phenomenal cosmic powers !
itty bitty living space
genie , that' s terrible .
but , oh to be free .
not have to go " poof !
what do you need ?
poof !
what do you need ?
poof !
what do you need ?
to be my own master , such a thing would be greater than all the magic and all the treasures in all the world !
but what am i talking about ?
let' s get real here .
it' s not gonna happen .
genie , wake up and smell the hummus
why not ?
the only way i get outta this is if my master wishes me out .
so you can guess how often that' s happened .
i' il do it .
i' il set you free .
aha , yeah , right .
no , really , i promise .
after make my first two wishes , i' il use my third wish to set you free .
well , here' s hopin ' .

let' s make some magic !
so how ' bout it ?
what is it you want most ?
well , there' s this girl

i can' t make anybody fall in love , remember ?
oh , but genie .
she' s smart and fun and ...
pretty ?

sir , i have found a solution to the problem with your daughter .
oh , really ?
right here .
if the princess has not chosen a husband by the appointed time , then the sultan shall choose for her .
but jasmine hated all those suitors !
how could i choose someone she hates ?
not to worry , my liege . there is more .
if , in the event a suitable prince cannot be found , a princess must then be wed to ... ... hmm ... interesting .
what ?
who ?
the royal vizier !
why , that would be ... me !
but , i thought the law says that only a prince can marry a princess , i' m quite sure .
desperate times call for desperate measures , my lord .
yes ... desperate measures ...
you will order the princess to marry me .
i ... will order ... the princess ... to ... ... but you' re so old !
the princess will marry me !

with his forty fakirs , his cooks , his bakers his birds that warble on key , make way for hlm , for hlm !!
splendid , absolutely marvelous .
your majesty , i have journeyed from afar to seek your daughter' s hand .
prince ali ababwa !
of course .
i' m delighted to meet you .
this is my royal vizier , jafar .
he' s delighted too .
ecstatic .
i' m afraid , prince abooboo  ababwa !
whatever .
you cannot just parade in here uninvited and expect to
by allah , this is quite a remarkable device .
i don' t suppose i might ...
why certainly , your majesty .
allow me .
sire , i must advise against this
oh , button up , jafar .
learn to have a little fun .
just where did you say you were from ?
oh , much farther than you' ve traveled , i' m sure .

hey , watch it .
watch it with the dumb rug !
out of the way , i' m coming in to land .
jafar , watch this !
spectacular , your highness .
ooh , it was lovely .
yes , i do seem to have a knack for it .
this is a very impressive youth .
and a prince , besides .
if we' re lucky , you won' t have to marry jasmine after all .
i don' t trust him , sire .
nonsense .
one thing i pride myself on jafar , i' m an excellent judge of character .
oh , excellent judge , yeah , sure ...
not !!!
jasmine will like this one !
and i' m pretty sure i' il like princess jasmine !
your highness , no .
i must intercede on jasmine' s behalf .
this boy is no different from the others .
what makes him think he is worthy of the princess ?
your majesty , i am prince ali ababwa !
just let her meet me .
i will win your daughter !
how dare you !
all of you , standing around deciding my future ?
i am not a prize to be won !
oh , dear .
don' t worry , prince ali .
just give jasmine time to cool down .
i think it' s time to say good bye to prince abooboo .
what am i going to do ?
jasmine won' t even let me talk to her .

so move !
that' s a good move .
i can' t believe it i' m losing to a rug .

a woman appreciates a man who can make her laugh !

jasmine , i tried to tell you , i' m just
so ali turns out to be merely aladdin .
just a con , need i go on ?

his personality flaws .

to send him packing on a one way trip , so his prospects take a terminal dip
his assets frozen , the venue chosen is the ends of the earth , whoopee !
so long ,
good bye , see ya !
ex prince ali !
abu ?

i' il teach you some respect !
no ...
genie , i have decided to make my final wish .

you' re right !
his power does exceed my own !
but not for long !
the boy is crazy .
