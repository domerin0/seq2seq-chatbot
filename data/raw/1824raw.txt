marion !
how about we give it another try ?
open the garage door .
great .
mummy is back .
we are here .
good evening my loves .
i bought a cake .
you prepared everything ?
looks good .
i must admit i' m rather fed up .
i had a very tiring day .
i' m exhausted
can you take the boy ?
i' d like to take a shower .
i touch up my make up then you can have the bathroom .
you look fine .
i' il be quick .
you still want noodles ?
not really right ...
dessert ?
you don' t want a dessert ?
is it for them you' re making yourself so pretty ?
idiot , you re making me smudge .
take him .
shall we go read a story ?
one afternoon , while she was making an airplane ...
she waters new flowers ...
aren' t they pretty ?
one afternoon , while she was making a paper airplane , the door opened .
who was it ?
leon .
here i am , leon !
what are they doing ?
they are hugging .
he didn' t close the door .
he was so happy he forgot to close the door .
they' re here .
good evening !
how are you ?
good .
you ?
you' re alone ?
he has not arrived yet ?
no .
you were not coming together ?
he got busy last minute .
i hope he won' t bail out .
if he hasn' t called , he' s coming .
you know him , so unpredictable .
gilles is not here either ?
showering .
things are better between you guys ?
better .
i' il tell you later .
what would you like to drink ?
gin please .
beautiful dress .
looks gorgeous on you .
where did you get it ?
it was my mother' s .
really ?
hello how are you ?
nicolas gone to bed yet ?
yes .
did he cry ?
just a bit .
two lesbian girlfriends of mine just had a baby .
i visited them at the hospital .
adorable .
how did they do it ?
with a friend and a spoon , the most efficient .
spoon ?
their gay friend jerked off into the spoon ...
the girl introduced the sperm in her vagina using the spoon !
very odd .
why not , if it works ?
what do you tell the kid when he grows up ?
the truth .
good luck to you .
marion , i find you awfully traditional .
the sperm spoon is the future .
it' s more useful than a hetero husband .
nonsense .
i was hoping to ask your wife to be my surrogate mother , but i guess that won' t work ...
is your boyfriend coming ?
he should be .
i don' t know what he' s doing .
should i call him ?
he' il be here shortly .
i don' t believe in fidelity .
it' s impossible , and it serves no purpose .
do you agree ?
he' s right .
being faithful is not natural .
respect for the spouse , trust ...
every couple has its lies and little secrets ...
it' s perfect that way .
frankly , why resist temptation ?
what for ?
to have regrets ?
no .
to feel stronger , for having resisted .
marion , you always amaze me .
gilles , what do you think ?
nothing special .
liar .
what do you want me to say ?
certainly not the truth .
then ...
i' ve never cheated on marion .
i' ve already cheated on christophe twice .
it didn' t count , just flings with men coming through .
and you told him ?
of course .
i tell him everything .
he' s young .
i cannot stop him .
and so far he always comes back to me .
you' re not jealous .
what for ?
i' m an old thing .
i did the same when i was his age .
and i always like to have a third party .
it lets me have some respite , some rest .
what about you ?
did you ever cheat on me ?
what would you like me to answer ?
no , of course .
incredible , i must forgive your errors ...
... but i must remain faithful .
that' s my mediterranean , macho side .
i only cheated on marion once .
you think that' s the right time ?
well , we' re all here pouring our hearts out ...
only fags can be unfaithful ?
i' m sure you' d love to hear a good hetero cheating story .
why not if it' s funny .
funny maybe not , but interesting .
maybe you' d rather not , marion .
i don' t mind .
maybe we' il leave you guys alone now .
no .
i' m curious to hear the story he wants to tell you .
it was 1 . 5 year ago , at some friends ' place .
we hadn' t seen them since our wedding .
they had organised a party at their place , 30 km away from paris .
nice ambiance , 20 guests , music , fun people .
everyone was drunk .
around midnight our friend lowered the lights .
we understood that , for those who wanted , the evening would turn into an orgy .
that' s great .
rather surprising .
especially since we didn' t know them that well .
we were a bit drunk
i was rather tickled by it .
women started to undress and lie down on mattresses .
the men folilowed .
it was well organised .
poppers , jelly , condoms , even coke .
first we watched from our little corner .
marion took my hand ... squeezed it real hard .
i asked her if she wanted to try .
you answered ' no ' .
but go ahead if you want .
i told you i' d only go with you .
but you insisted i go alone .
you just wanted to watch .
that' s all .
a girl came to fetch me and i went .
while marion was watching from the shadows ...
you had sex with this girl in front of marion ?
not only with the girl .
even with men .
you did stuff with guys ?
yeah , i took advantage .
i now know how my brother feels .
you' re having us on !
what did you do to the guys ?
run of the mill stuff .
sucked a few cocks , got fucked ...
you got fucked in the ass ?
fucked in the ass ?
marion , it' s not true .
please tell me you didn' t take part in ...
yes it' s true .
shall we move to the living rooom ?
i must get going .
oh no !
there' s this party i promised to drop by .
christophe , are you leaving too ?
matthieu , you want me to ...
up to you .
techno music , only young people .
don' t know if you' il like it .
just what he likes we' il see each other later then
i' il call you when i' m done .
thanks for everything .
it was great .
my pleasure .
see you soon .
i' il call you .
bye marion .
i' il walk you out .
good bye .
nice boy this mathieu you like him ?
yes .
nice , smart ...
and he knows what he wants .
yes .
i' m glad you like him .
i think he got along well with marion .
yes i think so .
we' re good together .
don' t you want to clean the plates under the tab before putting them in the machine ?
where' s the aluminum foil ?
i don' t know .
i' m happy for your brother .
why ?
seeing him in love like that .
it' s not that frequent .
i find it rather pathetic .
why do you say that ?
the boy doesn' t give a shit about him .
he went to his party alone .
he won' t last long .
it' s amazing .
when it comes to your brother ... ... you are always pessimistic .
and you optimistic .
it won' t last a week .
how do you know ?
just because it' s not conventional doesn' t mean they' il fail .
the most important is trust .
are you sure ?
he told me they were not having sex .
gilles
what ?
what are you doing ?
nothing .
he was crying .
are you coming ?
let me sleep .
it' s a boy .
have you thought of a name ?
yes .
we don' t agree .
anything wrong otherwise ?
no .
apart from the slight discharge this morning .
strange .
what ?
has he been moving a lot lately ?
no .
he' s rather more quiet .
is anything wrong ?
the placenta' s position is off .
i' m afraid it might block the baby' s exit .
is that serious ?
no .
if it bleeds too much we' il just have to induce .
yes , darling .
what' s the matter ?
aren' t you at the clinic ?
really ?
why ?
yes i' m here .
i' m coming right away .
don' t worry .
delphine , i' m bringing a dossier over .
no more calls .
now you turn up ?
we' ve been waiting for you for 3 hours .
marion was beside herself .
is she ok ?
it was not easy .
she' s in her room , resting .
she' s sedated .
and the baby ?
in the incubator .
he' s small .
they had a tought time getting him out .
the epidural didn' t work ; she went through hell .
where were you ?
we left messages !
i was caught in traffic .
marion didn' t understand , she was worried .
since you were not here , i attented the operation .
it was not pretty .
she bled a lot .
fortunately they could perform a c section .
back in my days it would not have been so fast and efficient ...
as you know , i lost my first child .
yes , you told me .
are you sure it' s this one ?
yes , he' s tiny .
number 5 .
you' re sure it' s not that one on the left ?
i guarantee you it' s number 5 .
why ?
you don' t like him ?
he looks so fragile ...
the midwife explained it to me .
the membrane was not playing its role so he stopped growing .
that' s why he' s small .
they noticed it early .
otherwise he could have died in her belly .
i was told not to worry .
he should end up with normal weight and height .
they grow up naturally , problem free .
gilles , what' s wrong ?
you' re not feeling well ?
i' m fine ; i just need 5 minutes of fresh air .
do you want me to come along ?
i' m fine thanks .
i' il wait for you in the waiting room .
yes .
when you' re back we' il check on marion together .
see you shortly .
oh shit .
hello gilles
is he born yet ?
yes .
marion is resting .
are you happy ?
yes .
we were not expecting him so early , but ...
problems always come at the wrong time .
is monique around ?
in the waiting room .
did she freak out ?
pardon ?
she must be so happy she must be hysterical .
maybe .
i don' t know .
she' s always hysterical anyway .
i' m going to see my daughter and the little monster .
coming along ?
i finish my cigarette .
are your parents here ?
i haven' t called them yet .
see you in a while .
answering machine .
incredible !
i hope nothing happened to him .
you just gave birth , and you' re worried about him !
you don' t know what you' re talking about .
he' s not the one who just had a c section .
i' m not surprised .
when i lost the baby , your dad was not around either .
he had bigger fish to fry .
are you gonna shut your big mouth ?
what' s with you ?
can' t you leave your daughter in peace for 5 minutes ?
you' re ressassing the same old boring stuff .
is it my fault if gilles is not here , just like you 30 years ago ? ! ?
when there' s a problem you only know how to disappear .
cut it out !
your father started it .
shut up !
that' s all we ask of you .
i leave you to rest .
bye dad .
thanks for coming .
you saw the way he spoke to me .
it' s no big deal .
at least he came .
it doesn' t mean he can yell at me like that .
go after him .
you think so ?
you know he' s waiting for you in the car .
yes
have a good rest .
hello ?
it' s me where are you ?
i' il explain .
it' s rather complex .
you ok ?
no
why ?
nothing .
it' s me .
i' m in pain .
why aren' t you here ?
why did you leave ?
i don' t know .
i' m sorry .
did you decide on the name yet ?
haven' t thought about it .
what would you like ?
i don' t know .
what about you ?
you wanted nicolas ?
yes , i like nicolas .
nicolas it is .
marion ?
yes ?
i love you .
can you pop by the house and bring me some clothes ?
marion ?
has a marriage contract been drawn up ?
yes .
in application of article 75 of the civil code ... ...
i will read through articles 212 to 215 ... ... on the rights and duties of the spouses .
212 . spouses must be faithful and supportive of each other .
213 .
they will jointly assume the moral and financial management of the family . they will provide for their children' s education and future .
214 .
spouses contribute ... ... according to their respective capacity .

i' il go take it off .

oh this is nice ...
i didn' t take off my panties .
would you like a little strip tease ?
i already don' t excite you anymore ?
gilles , are you asleep ?
good night my love .
you scared me .
i love you , i love you , i love you .
it' s cool .

jellyfish , jellyfish !
good evening .
i just arrived from the airport .

so so
an animator will take you to your room straight away .
you room number is 230
you are not superstitious , are you ?
no , no .
i feel good after our swim .
it' s not that bad here after all .
now you see that you could trust me .
and it' s not too crowded .
it' s still strange though , all those people coming alone .
they' re single and looking for a fling .
how dreadful .
i would never come here alone .
why not ?
it' s like a match making agency .
i find it very sad .
you can' t help it .
what ?
always criticizing .
i' m not criticizing , just stating facts .
is the weather nice ?
yes .
i slept well .
did you hear a raucous this morning ?
no .
what was it ?
dunno .
in the corridor , doors slamming ...
i heard nothing .
do you want a piece of bread ?
yes .
pardon me .
marion ?
yes ?
mr ferront , what are you doing here ?
i should be asking you that ; i thought you were in senegal ?
my friend dropped out , so i just booked any trip .
that' s funny .
i' m here with my girlfriend .
you were not in the plane .
when did you get it ?
i missed the plane .
came in last night .
are you here with someone ?
no , alone .
then come have lunch with us later .
yes , why not ?
so strange to bump into each other here .
i didn' t expect to see you in a swimsuit one day .
see you later , in the restaurant .
see you .
who was that ?
a girl who works for us ad department .
incredible to meet her here .
you didn' t know she was coming ?
we hardly know each other
are you jealous ?
you are jealous .
told her to join us for lunch .
she' s alone .
is she nice ?
i don' t know .
we' il see .
coming here alone doesn' t bother you ?
it does , but my girlfriend canceled at the last minute ..
we were supposed to go to senegal .
next time i guess ...
would have been very different holidays .
and it was not a package tour at all .
it was more of an adventure .
exactly what i would have liked to do .
why didn' t you ?
don' t ask me ...
i could only take 1 week .
impossible .
gilles works too hard ...
i wanted to take 2 weeks to visit sicily before coming here ... ...
next time for me too .
sicily is very beautiful .
you' ve been there ?
my boyfriend was from sicily .
went there a few times to visit his family .
you don' t feel like going back ?
not for the time being .
we broke up 4 months ago , i don' t feel strong enough yet .
i' m sorry .
it' s ok . you didn' t know .
anyway it' s over .
concentrate , we can' t get a decent rally going .
no need to get upset .
do you have water ?
thanks .
ah shit .
there .
you pick them up .
bravo ! it was really funny .
you move well .
i' m used to it .
that' s how we communicate in the office .
i didn' t understand anything .
i don' t speak italian .
you didn' t miss much .
do you want to go for a drink next door ?
not me .
we' re getting up early for the mountain trek but gilles ...
not if you' re not coming , no .
good luck for tomorrow .
good night .
why didn' t you go ?
you did not fancy a drink ?
no , it' s ok .
may i sit here ?
sorry , this seat is taken .
i thought you did not want a drink ?
do you want one ?
i find this girl touching .
who ?
marion
you' re trying to sell her to me or what ?
i think she' s pretty and very nice .
that' s all .
would that turn you on if i fucked her ?
it would turn you on , not me .
you' re right , i feel like fucking tonight .
you look comfy here .
ah ! it' s you ?
hello .
hello .
can i sit down ?
sure .
weren' t you supposed to go trekking ?
valerie went alone .
i didn' t feel like it .
i felt like sleeping late and getting a tan .
it' s really nice here .
yes .
it' s real quiet .
not like the club
how was the disco ?
nice .
i went back early .
alone ?
why are you asking me this ?
i don' t know ...
but going to a disco alone ... ... makes it easier to meet people ?
you really don' t know me .
i only went there to dance .
have you gone for a swim yet ?
no .
i was told the sea here is dangerous ...
... fairly strong currents .
is that so ?
the sea looks so calm , though .
yes .
have you been with someone since your previous boyfriend ?
no .
i don' t feel like it .
not yet .
have you been with valerie for a long time ?
4 years
are you married ?
why do you ask me that ?
i don' t know ...
no .
we' re thinking about it .
shall we go for a swim ?
ok .
