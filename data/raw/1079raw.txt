not in saigon .
lieutenant steven hauk is our immediate supervisor .
he' s a little goofy , but he' s okay .
sergeant major dickerson that' s another story altogether .
he was a commander of an elite special forces unit .
he came to us because of " prostrate " problems ... and some sort of social infection that doesn' t go away .
plus , i think he got shot in the ass , but i can' t confirm that .
anyway , he' s the man that you don' t want to aggravate .
ed , are you always this happy ?
cronauer !
sir !
at ease .
i' m general taylor .
hiya , general .

why , son , the shadow of your ass' d weigh 20 pounds .
i' il work on that , sir .
you' re not supposed to address the general saying " hiya .
what' s that , a new rule ?

that is humour .
i recognize that .
i also recognize your species of soldier .
i had a guy like you in the field one time .
he blew himself to pieces .
but not before his humour cost the lives of three very fine individuals .
i hope  you shut your fuckin ' hole !
you' re in southeast asia now , pal .
you got your cushy little assignment .
there' s nothin ' i can do about that .
in time , you will make me forget it .

am i being fairly clear ?
yes , sir .

adrian cronauer , gls , a wacky and welcome addition ...
to afrs , radio saigon .
nixon' s press conference .

where do you imagine you' re going ?
just gonna get a little somethin ' to eat .
you don' t have time .

we promised our listening audience nixon highlights by 4 : oo p . m .
i' ve been on the air for four hours .
i' m a little hungry .
that' s a joke , right ?
i get it .
no , i' m actually hungry .
well , i' m actually giving you an order .

in that case , gentlemen , let' s edit .
thank you .
mm mmm , campbell' s .
aha !
ha !
earl !
ha , you again .
no more fighting , okay ?
oh , you got it .
james !
nice , shiny green suit .
you look like an oriental leprechaun .
you like it ?
i got it in hong kong ... home of the shiny green suit .
and therefore , there is no place for neutrality ... or a neutralist sentiment in south vietnam .
as i leave vietnam today , there is no doubt , certainly , in my mind ...
that' s nixon . but that the viet cong will be defeated ... and that this war will be won .
asia does involve , i think , very appropriately as you have suggested , give and take .
well , i really didn' t make that suggestion , sir i' m sorry ,
the united states has no right to give .
why would cronauer' s voice be on this tape ?
i don' t know , lieutenant . ... its territory to the communists ,
mr nixon , thank you for that concise political commentary ... but i think i' d like to delve into something slightly more personal for the men in the field .
how would you describe your testicles ?
that they' re soft , that they' re shallow , that they have no purpose , oh , my god .
what are you saying , sir ?
oh , my god .
that they lack the physical strength .
how would you describe your sex life with your wife pat ?
uh , it is unexciting sometimes .
well , have you considered possibly a sex change ?
there is an operation that can transform you ...
please don' t do this to me .
please don' t do this to me . into a female great dane or possibly a very well hung chihuahua .
mr nixon , while you' ve been in vietnam , it' s rumoured that you smoked marijuana .
are you planning , sir , to take some of the mariruana home , back to the united states ?
how would you do that ?
by plane ... by helicopter and also by automobile .
i was wondering if you could do your mr ed , because i know people love that .
cut that thing off .
i said cut it off !
sir .
where is cronauer ?
still eating , sir .
i want to see him asap .
what , sir ?
as soon as possible .
vg , sir .
we interrupt this broadcast ... to bring you an emergency selection of the benny goodman orchestra .
we simply need to consider taking him of off the air
lieutenant , we get hundreds , maybe thousands of calls and letters each week , fan mail
he' s the first man in the history of armed forces radio to get fan mail .
every gi in this country is glued to his radio twice a day ... at o6 : oo hours and 16 : oo hours to hear that lunatic .
sir , the man has got an irreverent tendency .
he did a very off colour parody of former vp nixon .
i thought it was hilarious .
respectfully , sir ... the former v. p. is a good man and a decent man .
bullshit !
i know nixon personally .
he lugs a trainload of shit behind him that would fertilize the sinai .
why , i wouldn' t buy an apple from the son of a bitch , and i consider him a good , close , personal friend .
let' s get down to business here , general .
what the hell' s goin ' on here ?
we' ve got a mounting crisis in this country .
we' ve got a deejay that the men dearly love .
if you two have personal problems , solve them , will you ?
thank you , lieutenant .
thank you , lieutenant !
speak your piece , dick .
due respect , sir .

it' s the truth .
i just want to report the truth .
it' d be a nice change of pace .
what' s goin ' on here ?
sir , will you listen to me ?
this is not official news , airman .
as far as i' m concerned , it didn' t happen .
it did happen and i was  you shut your mouth .
what are you afraid of , dickerson ?
people might find out there' s a war goin ' on ?
this news is not official , airman .
you want everyone going under the assumption it' s perfectly safe here , don' t you ?
well , it' s not .
the fighting' s not just in the hills .
it' s downtown .
it' s a couple of fuckin ' blocks

adrian cronauer
good morning , vietnam !
hey , i know it' s not the morning , but that' s my trademark ... and " good evening " sounds too depressing ,
hey , we' re goin ' right now to the news .
from england , today , princess margaret threw a shoe !
easy , madge .
also , uh , elizab queen elizabeth , liz elizabeth taylor !
elizabeth taylor .
she' s still married after six months .
way to go , liz .
yea !
all right !
in saigon today , according to official sources ... nothing actually happened .
one thing that didn' t officially happen was a bomb didn' t officially explode at 14 : 3o hours ... unofficially destroying jimmy wah' s cafe .
get him out of there .
three men were unofficially wounded , and two men ...
whose identities are still not known at this time are unofficially dead it' s locked !
well , break the goddam door down !
although the police , ambulance and fire department responded ... what' s believed to be unofficial at this present moment .
turn the power of in that studio .
but his show is  turn it off !
now !
i just wanted to think that you should
the man should be court martialed , sir .
you think this is the most serious set of affairs i have to address this week ?
well , it' s not .
i can' t believe you' re gonna pass on this , general .
the man is a goddamned subversive .
he made a mistake , dick .
mistake , sir ?
i don' t want to be around when he broadcasts us troop movements to the other side .
i run the station according to strict guidelines set by military intelligence .
military intelligence ?
there' s a contradiction in terms .
sir , the man is a walking keg of dynamite .
in the eight weeks he' s been on the air , general , he' s disobeyed orders as to style and content
he' s read unofficial news .
what' s he gonna be like in six months ?
what' s he gonna be like when he' s ten times as popular , general ?
how easy is it gonna be to get him off the air then ?
who' il do the cronauer show ?
well , hauk can do it , sir , till i find a replacement .
okay , for now , suspend him .
sir , you' ve made the correct choice .
right here , right here on our show , diana ross and the " suprawns .
set me free why don' t you , babe
set me free why don' t you , babe
you don' t really need me you just keep me steamin' on

it' s nice to bomb in another language .
you will get sick if you drink some more .
come on .

you see trinh there .

red leather , yellow leather .

reading the news is one thing , but this stuff you wrote , i ' it' s not funny , sir it' s sad
sir ?
i' m begging you , don' t try to do comedy , it' s not in your blood
i' il do fine , comedy is what you make it ,
i' ve got pages and pages of great material .
right , abersold ?
i' m afraid you' re gonna be hittin ' bottom , sir .
if it isn' t funny , then why did i hear you laughing when you typed it ?
i was thinking of something else ,
thank you for your support .

sir , you' re not funny , ask around

hey , that was the great , exciting sound of petula clark .
beach boys .
those were guys .
of the beach boys ,
hey , that wraps it up for me , marty lee dreiwitz .
adrian cronauer is on temporary assignment ... but boy , do i have a surprise for you .
don' t build him up .
you' il only let ' em down .
please welcome to the microphone ... the lieutenant of laughs , the officer of oral , the westmoreland of wit ... swingin ' steven hauh !
hello , vietnam , and greetings ,
soon , the news , then
lieutenant steve !
lieutenant steve !
who' s that ?
it' s me, your old pal frenchy ,
listen , frenchy , let me ask you something .
do you like good food ?
oh , but of course .
uh , the french love good food .
well , then , i guess that would make you an " eatie gourmet .
oh , ho , ho , ho , lieutenant steve .
oh , frenchy .
" oh , ho , ho , lieutenant steve .
frenchy .
you know , i really shouldn' t kid frenchy ... because sometimes he " stan getz " mad at me ... and he could " al hirt " me .
uh , lieutenant steve , let' s play some music .
okay , frenchy .
what would you like to hear ?
well , uh , i love a good polka as much as the next man .
well , a good polka it is for my good friend frenchy .
i think some apologies are in order .
you' re not gonna continue this broadcast , are you , sir ?
what are they doing ?
oh , they' re buddhists .
they' re sitting for peace , wisdom and knowledge .
they' re waiting for enlightenment .
this man lose one son from blasting american mine .
his father and brother was killed by french long ago .
i think it' s not fair to him .
look .
he' s going , " no big deal . " look .
how lovin ' can you feel when you got that moment when
don' t you know that the time can be that away , warka wack wacka wack , wacka wack
and don' t you know that it ain' t gonna be and you feel that the time you see
and it all wacka wack wacka wacka , wacka wacka i know and i' m movin '
look .
up there .
pull .
pull .
you not understand .
you not .
we no future together , " cronow .
my country , maybe no future .
hey , i like you .
i just want to be your friend , okay ?
i know it sounds dumb .
i i not can do this , " cronow .
no .
no friend , " cronow .
not good for , for me .
my brother , okay , friends .
but vietnam ladies not friends .
please .
okay ?
not friends .
great week .
that' s about as good a polka as you' il ever hear .
you want cronauer back on the air .
we' ve gotten duffel bags filled with information asking for cronauer' s reinstatement .
the men all hate hauk .
they want cronauer back .
he' s an exhilarating personality , and polkas are just no substitute .
i think i see a pattern forming here .
sir , these letters are unequivocal .
uh , e . g .
hey , hauk , eat a bag of shit .
you suck .
that' s pretty much to the point , sir .
not much grey area in this one .
we got one positive call from some guy in wichita who thought hauk' s comedy was visionary and interesting .
the other 1, 1oo calls said that the man can' t do comedy to save his dick .
that' s a direct quote , sir .
i' ve taken 9o calls this morning .
they just don' t like hauk .
captain hauk sucks the sweat off a dead man' s balls .
i have no idea what that means , sir , but it seems very negative to me .
i think the troops are tryin ' to tell us somethin ' , fellas .
sir , if it is my programming choices , i can change .
i' ve been broadcasting the polkas because i thought a certain segment of the men ... weren' t represented by cronauer' s broadcasts of rock and roll .
but i can easily play an occasional gay lewis record .
it doesn' t make a damn whether you play polkas or don' t play polkas .
military politics .
nothing personal .
the men just like him better than they do you .
he maliciously and with purposeful intent read unofficial news .
no , no , no , no .
he made a mistake .
we all make mistakes .
now this thing is a delicate balance over here ... and i don' t want it dependent on a disc jockey .
the men want him back , i want him back .
sir , you heard from the men who don' t like my humour , but what about the silent masses who do ? .
and as far as polkas , they are a much maligned musical taste .
lieutenant , you don' t know whether you' re shot , fucked , powder burned or snake bit .
i don' t care about polkas .
they' re rioting in hue .
we' re bringin ' in thousands of troops every month .
terrorism' s on the uprise in saigon .
the problems of this country have not one goddamned thing to do with ... whether you play polkas or don' t play polkas .
the men want him back .
i want him back .
reinstate the man .
sir , in my heart ...
i know i' m funny .
thank you , lieutenant .
there you are , sir .
please don' t call me " sir .
it just came down the pike .
you' re back on the air , sir .
i' m not goin ' on .
what do you mean you' re not goin ' on ?
if you don' t understand what i said , maybe you should take my english class .
i' m not goin ' on .
you' re a very attractive man , abersold .
don' t think i haven' t noticed .
you' il be bored , you know .
what are you gonna do with your time ?
i don' t know .
i may go downtown , look for a vietnamese man named phil .
or i may just stay here and listen to old pat boone records .
try and find some hidden meaning ' cause basically i believe that that man is a misunderstood genius .
genius .
what are you saying to me ?
i' m sayin ' i' m through , ed .
i' m tired of people tellin ' me what i can' t say .
this news isn' t official .
that comment is too sarcastic .
i can' t even make fun of richard nixon , and there' s a man who' s screaming out to be made fun of .
so fuck it .
sorry .
is he all right ?
no , phil , he' s not all right .
a man does not refer to pat boone as a beautiful genius if things are all right .
sir .
garlick ?
i' d like you to collate these one minute spots prior to broadcast .
you have a problem with that , young man ?
absolutely not .
i live to collate , sir .

edward .
i' d like an explanation .
on anything in particular ?
a lot of people went to the mat for you .
thousands of guys wrote in , called in , tryin ' to get you reinstated .
and i literally think that you owe it to all of them to get your ass back on the air .
if you haven' t noticed , the army doesn' t really want me , ed .
they' ve been harassing me since the day i got of the plane .
so what ?
it' s the guys in the field that matter , remember ?
those are the guys that are dyin ' .
edward , i tried to tell the truth , and they kicked me of the air .
i screw up once more , dickerson sends me into the field with a rifle .
i come home in a box .
what you do is important to a lot of people .
forget it , will ya ?
listen .
i give up .
i' m gonna phone ' em in , okay ?
enough bullshit .
i' m outta here .
see you , fellas .
buy you some lunch .
can' t let you do that .
listen , if i don' t get to my class , there' s gonna be a bunch of vietnamese speaking in short choppy sentences .
look , we gotta talk .
we gotta talk now .

yeah , and my mother' s a werewolf , right ?
yeah .
tuan is also known as phan duc tho .
he' s currently wanted by the south vietnamese police in connection with several bombings in th area ... including the one at jimmy wah' s .
surely you' re familiar with that incident .
did you ever wonder how a young south vietnamese boy gets into and out of vc held territory .
it' s dangerous out there .
things just jump out at you .
and yet this boy can get in and out without a scratch .
and what about jimmy wah' s ?
didn' t you ever wonder why you were pulled out ... just moments before the whole place blew up ?
or are you normally not that inquisitive ?
friends of phan duc tho .
these three were executed shortly after this photo was taken .
your friend is next .
i don' t recommend that you tangle with me on this one , airman .
there' s not too many high ranking officers would be sympathetic to a serviceman with links to terrorists .
the army is kind of quirky that way .
a conviction on the charge of treason against the united states carries with it some penalties ... kind of on the stiff side , if you know what i mean .
i have arranged for an honourable discharge , provided you leave without incident .
ten hut .
at ease .
cronauer , i' m sorry as hell about this thing .
god damn it , i like you , son .
i like what you do .
most of all , i like what you' ve done for the men .
but facts are facts .
this could give the army a black eye .
i' m not gonna cover for you this time , son .
sir ?
what about the show ?
we' il handle it .
i' m sorry , son .
why' d you do this ?
i don' t like your style , your politics or your sense of humour .
i don' t like what you say or how you say it .
from now on , the fighting men of vietnam will hear exactly what they' re supposed to hear .
you' re on a dc 8 from tan son nhut airport tomorrow at 18i : 3o hours .
i recommend you pack quietly .
that' s all i have for you , airman .
you know ... you' re in more dire need of a blow job than any white man in history .
whoa , there , dick .
put the brakes on .
i wanted to wait till the airman left to talk with you .
uh , dick , i' m transferring you .
transferring me , sir ?
mm hmm .
where to , sir ?
you' re going to guam .
guam , sir !
there' s nothin ' goin ' on in guam !
why guam ?
dick , i' ve covered for you a lot of times ' cause i thought you was a little crazy .
but you' re not crazy .
you' re mean .
and this is just radio .
more dire need of a blow job than any white man in history . " that' s funny .

you gotta tell me where the hell he is .
no , i don' t  bullshit !
listen .
no more games , okay ?
the army knows about your brother .
i have to leave the country because of my association with him .
they have pictures of him .
if they find him , they will shoot him .
if you want to continue to have a brother , you take me to him now !
phan duc tho !

no wonder you hauled ass .
you were my friend .
i trusted you .
you hear me ?
you naive man , " cronow .
you take a stupid side .
now you have to go .
it' s better off .
that' s not the fucking point !
understand me ?
i fought to get you into that bar , and then you blow the fuckin ' place up .
listen .
i gave you my friendship and my trust ... and now they tell me that my best friend is the goddam enemy !
enemy ?
what is enemy ?
you killing my own people so many miles from your home .
we not the enemy .

you used me to kill two people .
two people died in that fuckin ' bar .
big fucking deal !
my mother is dead .
and my older brother , who be 29 years old , he dead .
shot by americans .
my neighbour , dead .
his wife , dead .
