i' ve never been so close before .
i know how much this means toyou .
the county commission went offwalking on air ... when chuck raven brought dickie pilager to the table .
that was a nice thing for him to do .
nice ? .
i' m paying chandlertyson a fortune for that kind ofaccess .
a fortune ? .
a slice ofthe pie .
but theywere starstruck , gracie .
the zoning' s in the bag .
these people will bend over backwards .
you have worked so hard .
ifwe were a little bit more liquid ...
i' d sink every dimewe have into this thing .
likeyou did that time with the stock market ? .
hell , it' s more than the money .
i' m building a city , grace .
a city .
we run something on theweb site information we' ve got we connect the dots ... and the guilty party , they pretend to ignore it .
ifthey sue us , certain documents could be entered in a court oflaw ... where ifyou deny things it' s perjury .
you gotta have the documents .
it' s amazing what things are blowing under my door and end up on my desk .
so , you plant the seed .
and the mainstream guys , the print journalists ... they bring it to their editors and their editors say ...
cool yourjets .
this is too far out .
we don' t have the resources .
we don' t have the balls to go after this kind ofthing .
but track the story ... and ifit ever breaks
you gotta have the balls .
so we keep accumulating the facts ... till the story is screaming out so loud it' s impossible to ignore .
and they run a little test item on page six ... saying allegations have been made .
allegations ? .
it' s beneath their dignity to quote some cellar dwellerweb site ... in their hallowed journal .
but the bastards in power have to publicly deny those allegations ... and then they' re fair game .
first it' s the columnists taking potshots .
then when they' ve got the politicians on the run ... they use our legwork , our ideas to write outraged exposs and win pulitzers .
then they gang up like a pack ofjackals .
but somebody has to plant the seed .
the seed of doubt .
he seems a lot more gubernatorial with the sound off .
fora dayis coming , myfriends ... a great dayanda terrible day ... a day when the skies shall open and the waters shall part ... and the dead shall rise up and walk upon the earth .
and the wicked and the righteous shall be judged alike .
but that day cannot come ... unless the children oflsrael are within the holy land ... for so it has been prophesied in the great book ofrevelations .
so let us look at a map ofthe middle east .
let us look at the headlines oftoday ... and see what conclusions we can draw from the evidence .
many are the portents and the signs .
but we need to discern a pattern .
we need to connect one event with the other ... and it will be clear that there are no accidents ... that there is a greater force at work ... and it holds the plan for armageddon .
richard pilager cares about the american worker .
you work with the same bunch al i the ti me ? .
yeah , more or less .
as far as i know , they' re all citizens .
i wasn' t asking that .
mojados are a bit cheaper , but they' re not worth the hassle .
need some hard huevos to keep ' em in line .

i wouldn' t go that far .
butyou should check into the packing houses across town .

you heard ofvince esparza ? .
yeah , i' ve heard the name .
he' s the saddam fucking hussein oflabor contractors .
they pay the coyote half up front to get them across the border ... and when they' re delivered here they owe esparza the rest .
so they start in the hole .
and they stay in it .
he keeps them moving around the country ... keeps them isolated , keeps them scared .
where can i find him ? .
you do not want to fuckwith vicente esparza , my friend .
i hired a few ofhis boys without knowing it once .
they' d run off or try to make theirway back home .

you' re , like , really accurate with that , right ? .
it depends on how much dope i' ve smoked .
how much haveyou smoked ? .

there was an incident on the campaign trail ... that was potentially embarrassing toyour brother .
what , he made a speech without a teleprompter ? .
there was a dead body involved .
anyone i know ? .
lzaro huerta ? .

maybe just another skeleton out of daddy' s closet .
you sure you don' t want a hit ? .
you look a little tense .
no .
it makes me paranoid .
like someone' s gotyou in their crosshairs ? .
yeah .

my bodywasn' t the same .
your center of gravity changes ... and you can' t do the jumps .
that' s what happened to tonya harding , you know .
it wasn' t nancy kerrigan .
it was her center of gravity .
you mature , your perception changes ... and you never get it back .
what' s your name ? .
you' re cute .
thanks .
if i' m being investigated , i could do worse .
excuse me .
and who wants to know ? .
you gotta be him .
howyou figure on that ? .
it' s the shoes , ese .
braceros don' t be wearing their party boots on the job .
vince esparza .
man , you a legend .
people sayyou got crews working all over the county .
people say a lot of shit that isn' t necessarily true .
i' m looking for a guy named lzaro huerta .
i don' t keep track oftheir names .
i' m not runnin ' a summer camp here .
would you mind ifl was to askyour jornaleros a few questions ? .
yeah , i would mind .
they' re here to work .
theywanna blow their nose , scratch their balls , talk about their girlfriends ... they can do it on their own time .
this is a job here .
this is private property .
and ifsomeone who is not authorized to be here was to get hurt ... it' d be my responsibility .
they' re hiding something .
my first husband was a downhill racer .
won the bronze at innsbruck .
wow .
he ditched me in , what , ' 85 .
my girlfriend just moved out .
you poor baby .
took my couch .
you can have this one ifyou want .
she picked it out .
it was both of ours .
she paid for half ofit .
rodney ? .
they called him hot rod .
won the bronze ? .
he runs a lodge in aspen he got as a settlement .
he sued you for alimony ? .
daddy paid him off so he wouldn' t file adultery charges .
anything to avoid another public scandal .
you were adultering ? .
yeah .
but so was he .
but he was the one who hired some fucking investigator to take pictures .
we don' t do much ofthat these days divorce stuff .
transom peeping ? .
nobody has transoms anymore .
butyou still peep .
well , mostly it' s on , you know , computer records .
we have ways to access .
we share information , buy lists your credit balance , whereyou travel , what videos you rent .
wow .
that' s invasion of privacy .
so the skier ditched you .
then i tried living in california for a while ... but there was nobody there to embarrass but myself .
soyou are trying to embarrass him .
it' s pointless .
what could i do they haven' t seen worse on some reality show ? .
you' re a senator' s daughter ... sister to the future governor .
they catch one president getting a bj in the oval office .
the next rigs the election , gets awaywith it .
people have lost the ability to be scandalized .
so nowyour ambition is ? .
make sure my son gets out ofhis 20s in one piece .
represent my country in 2004 .
you' re that good at it , huh ? .
you know ... the amazon women amputated one oftheir breasts .
it got in the way ofthe bow string .
give me three ofthose lottery tickets .
i' m feeling kinda lucky all ofthe sudden .
somebody' s fucking with me .
these were bad guys .
they owned a whole bunch oflow rent housing downtown .
the building boom had started , and they had a big offer to sell ... but they couldn' t legally evict their tenants .
so theywere doing strong arm stuff , intimidating .
there was even some arson involved .
the march of progress .
the housing inspectorwho should have been on top ofthis skaggs was taking payoffs .
i had these two informants very deep throat .
meetings in parking garages , the whole deal .
and they give me the big lead .
now , this is criminal activity that they' re exposing .
so i write the story .
my editor , mitch , he trusts me enough to run with it .
and they' re willing to testify in court ? .
they said yeah , ifit came to it .
but i didn' t have ' em on tape .
the landlord and the inspector sue the paper ... one of my sources blows town and the other flat denies it .
big retraction , settlement out of court ... and i' m seriously fired .
worse , i' m the guy who fabricates .
from that day on ... the monitor concentrated on who bakes the best chocolate chip cookie in denver .
and i couldn' t get a job delivering a newspaper .
the editor should' ve  he got fired too .
he runs a what doyou call it ? .
a web site .
at leastyou did something .
you know ? .
i' ve just been taking up space and emptying out my trust fund .
hey , you took all these pictures .
that' s a hobby .
you raised a kid .
isn' t he gorgeous ? .
his father his biological father
bugged out ofthe whole deal .
i can' t blame him , with the publicity and what a little tramp i was then .
but deweyjunior is a
he' s a nice guy , you know .
despite having me for a mother .
you raised a nice kid .
maybe that' s whatyou' re good at .
one ofthe things i' m good at .
this is a nation basedon christian principles .
what i promise to work for ... is a government that respects those principles .
a government that supports traditional familyvalues ...
that respects the sanctity ofhuman life .
a government strong enough , brave enough ... to maintain the cultural equilibrium .
what' s " cultural equilibrium " mean ? .
no handouts for homos .
hey .
what' s up , sugar ? .
can some ofthe guys stay over tonight ? .
they don' t have homes ? .
they don' t have satellite .
there' s stuffwe want to watch .
you' il have to sort out where everybody sleeps .
i can handle that .
you sounded really good today .
you should find a club to play in .
we don' t have any of our own material .
so write some .

yeah .

depends on how long they' ve been missing .
twenty threeyears .
my father .
dewey hamilton .

so , how would i start ? .
you know , like ifhe' s moved out ofthe state ? .
sometimes people can
sometimes people don' t want to be found .
and ifyou do , it can be pretty disappointing .
ifthings are messy , you gotta face them sooner or later .
areyou on the web ? .
wired to the eyeballs .
there are a couple ofthings you can try .
glad you could make it .
you' re conscious .
painkillers , man .
i' m flying .
they said you had an accident ? .
it wasn' t no accident .
it was him .
i saw the boots .
you know .
the one who sticks his head in the sand .
ostrich ? .
ostrich skin boots .

o' brien .
i been tryin ' to trackyou down .
sheriffskaggs , my friend tony guerra .
shaving accident ? .
you' il make me laugh and break my ribs again .
i haven' t heard a peep out ofyou , danny .
that wasn' t our agreement .
i' m offthe case .
step on your own dick again ? .
used to be this guy was a reporter ... till his mouth got way ahead ofhis brains .
there' s a lot more to this than some illegal alien floating in a lake .
the people who hired me  the peoplewho hired you fired you ... which means you' re out ofthe conversation .
they hired me to pretend  that means makeyourself scarce , son .
i need to talk toyour amigo here , alone .
later , tony .
you sleep with a client' s sister ? .
that is so unprofessional !
that' s not why raven wanted me offthe case , is it ? .
no , but he didn' t like it !
he wanted me off' cause i' m getting too close to something theywanna hush up !
that' s the whole point ofthejob , danny ... and he doesn' t trustyou to do it !
i don' t have all the pieces , but lzaro  you don' t have any pieces !
he knew something , saw something , and they set him up !
had him killed .
chuck raven had you fired because he found outyou used to be a reporter .
okay ? .
that doesn' t change anything .
he called yesterday morning .
ifyou would checkyour cell phone once in a while , you' d know that .
that sheriff , he' s been right on my tail .
i cannot deal with your paranoia .
take the rest ofthe week off , come in on monday ... and we will sit down and discuss what' s left ofyour so called career .

sign here .
and next time i want all the receipts .
right .
lupe !

thankyou .
howwould you like to make $200 ? .
they said these two men , rafi and fito ... have gone to the church .
it' s not sunday .
the day ofthe dead .
tell ' em i came instead oftony .
they don' t trustyou .
tell them i have their names and that iftheywant to stay in this country
you wouldn' t do that to them , would you ? .
they don' t know that , do they ? .
we can go somewhere else to talk .
they sayyou have to come with them to the ruins , to silver city .
so , when do we get to this joint ? .
this is it .
they buried the cityyears ago .
what now ? .
this is where lzaro died ? .
he says lzaro died where they take the meat from the bones .
the slaughterhouse .
benagra .
the benagra slaughterhouse .
lzaro was a newly arrived .
he was a very shy person .
very afraid of everything in the north .
but especially afraid ofthe boss .
and the jefe was ? .
vicente esparza .
vincent esparza carries a gun ? .
we were the cleaning crew .
aftermidnight , when theystop the line ... they come in to clean the metal with scalding hot water mixed with clorina .
there is always so much noise ... andyou can' t see from the steam .
they have told don vicente that thejob up above ... cleaning the machine that takes the skin offthe cows is not safe ... that there has to be more scaffolding or something to hold onto .
but he says that only little babies are crying for their mamas ... and he sends whoever he doesn' t like to do it .
this day he sends lzaro huerta .
they told lzaro he shouldn' t shoot the steam full pressure ... when he' s turning it on .
there was nobody else i n that part of the factory ... but these two men and vicente , their boss .
he asked them to put the body in a garbage barrel ... and to clean his blood with the blood ofthe animals .
at the endofwork , theycarried the body out to his truck and he drove them here .
he told them he knew this place from years ago ... when he was hired to hide some kind ofgarbage .
they felt bad treating a man they knew a human being
like he was garbage too .
they left the body at the back of the tunnel ... and vicente told them that now they are part of a crime ... and if the police finds out they are going to jail .
ifhe doesn' t kill them first .
soyou left the body up here ? .
they came back three days later to bury him as a christian , but
he wasn' t here ? .
he was gone .
maybe it was a miracle .
they left him where there was water on the floor .
so when they came back the waterwas this high .
show me .
come on .
all right .
wait for me here .
help !
help !
help , up there !
mr. o' brien !
areyou there ? .
mr. o' brien !
mr. o' brien , you got all wet !
look atyou !
where are the guys ? .
they took them away .
took them ? .
la migra come , chase those men and take them away .
how come they didn' t take you ? .
because i carry my citizen papers always .
guess i' il have to leave you here , lupe .
it' s okay .
how come you didn' t take the day off ? .
i belong to the iglesia evanglica .
this ? .
this is the devil' s work .
i' il keep that in mind .
thanks for everything .
be careful , mr. o' brien .
hey .
you again .
hey .
i' m sorry about last night .
i get disgusted with myself , and i take it out on other people .
don' t worry about it .
you been swimming ? .
cave diving .
i' m sorry ifl gotyou in trouble .
the thing i' m investigating , i got a little in over my head .
you got fired ? .
probation .
sorry .
doyou thinkyou might call me sometime ? .
listen , maddy
you' re scared of me , aren' tyou ? .
no .
i' m scared ofyour family .
would you say those are ostrich skin ? .
the guy' s boots ? .
yeah .
tony lamas .
excuse me .
you got a problem , my friend ? .
you' re vicente esparza .
come on .
we gotta talk , you and me .
you' re the one who' s been stirrin ' up all this shit , huh ? .
askin ' about tattoos , botherin ' myworkers .
now i hear the police are lookin ' for me .
i' ve got nothing againstyou .
it' s the people aboveyou the ones that had you dump those barrels into the mine .
they knew what happened to lzaro  what the fuck is it toyou ? .
you don' t come down here where i live asking me fuckin ' questions !
i' m not afteryou .
it' s them !
that' s right .
you don' t care about me , and i don' t care aboutyou .
i don' t care ifyou live oryou die .
you see this ? .
you see what this is , cabrn ?
you ask me one more fuckin ' question
don' t move !
just freeze right there !
put it down , dave .
one' s deader than a doornail , and the other' s unarmed .
put it down .
he had his gun out .
put it in the holster !
and then go keep that crowd from coming back here !
go !
jesus !
you said it .
he wasn' t gonna shootyour deputy .
boy' s a little overtrained .
this is esparza ? .
yeah .
he' s got that wanted for questioning ... killed while resisting arrest look about him .
they didn' t clean up the cyanide waste .
theyjust dumped it into an old mine .
esparza was working for bentel then .
he told my guys that he' d dumped something there before .
only it' s flooded now , and it' s flooding more every day .
somehow huerta' s body got swept away by it ... and pushed through the mountain into one ofthe streams that feeds the lake .
this is sounding crazy , isn' t it ? .
throw a dead body into a cave ... and three days later it comes back out into the world all on its own ? .
sure , a lot of people' il buy that .
it' s the water pressure .
the names ofthese two mexicans you sayyou talked to
come on !
you had immigration follow us and pick them up .
did i ? .
halfthis town is illegal .
immigration is gonna botherto drive into the middle ofnowhere ... and just run into mywitnesses ? .
mr. quiones and mr. lpez have been debriefed by the i ns .
according to them , theywere working at benagra packing ... along with a certain lzaro huerta , also an undocumented alien ... until one day he chose ... not to show up forwork .
that' s the last they saw ofhim .
of course they' re gonna say that .
they' re back on a plane in 24 hours ... courtesy of the united states government .
unless , of course ... you choose to include that crock of shit thatyou just told me ... in your official statement ... in which case , they' d be accessories to wrongful death , at least .
possibly murder .
they' d be fucked .
bienjodido is the phrase , i believe , yeah .
slaughterhouse ? .
the slaughterhouse operates within guidelines set by the law .
all we' ve got is a failure to report an accident ... and illegal burial ... which begins and ends with vince esparza .
doesn' t it ? .
i' il giveyou a few minutes to think about it .
you called his name .
when you were looking for him , you called his name .
your buddy in the hospital put us on the lookout .
vehicular homicide ? .
it' s the same speech every time .
i don' t have time now , nora .
ifl spent a few hours reviewing his statistics ...
later . instead ofjust listening to him go on and on and on come on , leo !
come on !
what' s the deal ? .
where haveyou been ? .
out reporting the news .
i know it' s easier to watch it on cable , but
staff meeting in 15 minutes , people !
that means everybody !
then it' s true .
what ? .
they' il say , " nobody' il be let go
but when they bought the sentinel , they cut 30 jobs the first month .
theywho ? .
what are you talking about ? .
we' ve been sold to gold mine publishing , that bentel owns .
these rockymountains that i love so much ... are part of ournational heritage ... something we must keep safe forfuture generations .
don' t even thi nk about it .
whatever pathetic publicity stunt you' re hatching ... in that drug addled brain ofyours .
i don' t work foryou anymore .
i know .
you were dismissed ... when we discovered an incident ofsubstance abuse on the job .
anything you say  don' t threaten me .
you are the boy that cried wolf , o' brien .
it was in all the papers .
a murderwas committed .
what ? .
murder by deregulation ? .
that kind of thinking went out in the last century .
that' s not the point .
the point is that without a smoking gun ... all you' ve got is another opportunity ... to fuck upyour sorry excuse for a life even more than now .
people likeyou thinkyou' ve got everything covered .
you think nobody cares enough to fight back .
but somedayyour shit' s gonna catch up with you , and when it does
you' re a loser .
that' s already been established beyond doubt .
so just try and be a good one .
okay ? .
don' tyou thinkyou ought to changeyour shirt ? .
how' d you find me ? .
i' m a detective .
you said we were investigators .
i' m a detective .
you' re an investigator .
and the first rule is , don' t go finding more than you' re looking for .
look , ifit weren' t for mort
all ofhis plans , every scheme he' s ever had ... has had a jinx on it .
his wife has to support him .
he thinks he' s a failure .
ifthis silver citything were to fall through
and he' s in with the pilagers ? .
up to his neck .
hush money ? .
severance pay .
and don' t go making trouble , danny .
won' t do any good .
so why' d you ever hire a basket case like me ? .
lookwho i married .
travel expenses .
richard pilager cares aboutyou .
it' s like he' s a bad actor that doesn' t believe himself in the part .
you know ? .
would you rather have dickie pilager as governor ... or haveyour pancreas pulled out through your nose with a rusty coat hanger ? .
but still , 33 % prefer the coat hanger .
what' s this ? .
weird .
silver city
someone left us a treasure map .
i hearyou' ve been bought .
i mean , notyou personally .
part ofthe happy bentel family .
there' s a man named lzaro huerta in that box what' s left ofhim .
so , this is your case .
mr. o' brien , yes ? .
yes .
seora .
hello .
ramn contreras from the mexican consulate .
on behalf ofthe aggrieved family ...
i offer my sincere gratitude foryour generosity .
i' d like to wire some money ... on top ofthe casket and the shipping costs .
theywon' t
anything you could send would be appreciated .
there are several children .
ifyou' il excuse me
the paperwork .
nice to meetyou .
you haven' t been sleeping .
no , not really .
i split up with chandler .
really ? .
i was ... grousing about communications monopolies ... and he gave me his usual line ... and we got into a fight , one thing led to another and
conflict ofinterests .
many a promising merger has failed due to a conflict ofinterest .
right .
how doyou feel ... about us splitting up ? .
euphoric .
that' s how i felt .
i should have been suicidal .
my paper' s been co opted ...
i have all these people to call and tell them they' re not invited ... to the wedding in aspen , and
wereyou gonna do one ofthose ski lift ceremonies ? .
it would have been a very tasteful , very caucasian affair .
ifyou changeyour mind , i know ofa very good caterer .
maybe we could see each other sometime .
that' d be great .
so , you quityourjob .
grace fired me .
so , what doyou do now ? .
first i need to repaint my living room .
i promise to respect and support our american traditions
i' m waiting . our right to bear arms ...
i' m still waiting . our right to the freedoms ofreligious worship and expression ... so fundamental to our liberty .
i promise to support a smaller , more efficient government .
no longermust the big brother ofthe social welfare system ... dictate our daily lives ... intruding , impeding , regulating ... the very air that we breathe .
what i' m talking about , my fellow citizens ... comes down to that precious word " freedom .
a freedom enjoyed by those bold individuals ... who came to a wild frontier and built the west that we love so dearly ... those steadfast men and women ... whose spirit ofdaring and conquest ... inspires us to this day .
the freedom from fear ofthose who envy our good fortune ... who scorn our democratic institutions .
freedom from the cultural tyranny ... ofthe special interest groups and the new age demagogues ... who would seek to deny us ... the harvest ofour god given bounty ... under the false banner ofenvironmental correctness .
the freedom to seek health , happiness ... and , yes , fortune ... in this glorious mountain state ofours .
this is the freedom i prom ise you , my fel low citizens .
but let not a man be judged by the promises he makes ... but by the works he leaves behind .
america
may god bless you all .
may god thygloryfind
