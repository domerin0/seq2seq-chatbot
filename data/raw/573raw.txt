it' s ok , don' t worry about it .

hey , i want no part on your stories , you hear me ?
i' ve learned my lesson .
not another word on this .
not one .
fine .
how' s a passenger going to get through security with a gun ?

you' re not supposed to be here .
but you are a trombone short ...
are you questioning my intelligence ?
yes , sir .
no , sir , i mean , no , sir .
we wouldn' t wanna question his intelligence .
keep going .
i thought this was a simple budget matter , the things about the tickets .
well , not entirely .
not entirely for you .
look ... you and i know about disappointments in school ... and i wouldn' t want him to let the team down , you know what i mean , choke ?
sorry , coach .

what a loser .
that' s my seat .
no , it' s not .
it' s mine .
someone' s gonna get hurt .

right , on vacation in washington .
not in the air , dad .
the cockpit ?
the instruments , it' s all the same as your computer program , exactly .
yeah , but , it' s still not the same as flying for real .

good evening , ladies and gentlemen , this is captain noonan .
we' re at the head of the queue now , on our way to washington dc .
flying is 65 times safer than driving ... according to michigan transportation research institute .
what are you saying ?
that we' re lucky to make it to the aiport ... in the car ?
ladies and gentlemen , we' ve reached our cruising altitude .
the ride is smooth , so i' il turn off ... the seat belt sign .
as always though ... we ask that whenever you' re in your seat ... you keep it buckled down .
since most of us ... since you' il be sleeping ... we won' t speak to you again until just before our arrival in washington .
<i>good night .
have a nice rest . </ i>
man , they better serve supper soon .
we should do something .
get real , ricky .
our lives could depend on it .
i don' t wanna hear about it .
your daydreams always get us into trouble .
hi , ricky .
hi , mary jo .
shashi .
this is great , you made it .
did you know our coach' s nickname in highschool ...
was " choke " ?
i knew that already .
neat .
let' s party , come on .
hey , small .
my hero !
let' s move .
it' s night , we can' t see out anyway .
let' s get more room .
are you all right ?
yes .
i hate these things .
you' re afraid of flying ?
but you put these things together .
i can keep them flying , i just wish they' d never been invented .
it' s not funny .
i guess it' s a little funny .
don' t worry , i' il be right next to you the whole time .
tha front is moving a lot faster than they forecast .
must be the one that' s beating through texas .
see those pictures on news ?
can we get above it ?
i don' t know .
call dispatch , get an update .
you got it .
he hasn' t made a move yet .
i' m starving .
shashi , all i' m asking is that you take a look .
you see that bulge in the jacket ?
it has to be the gun .
i hope they have a choice .
maybe fish .
what' s this about a gun , nerdboy ?
nothing .
hey , nerdette , what' s this about a gun ?
ricky says he saw a man , like a passenger , with a gun .
it was nothing , i was just kidding him .
a gun ?
come on , that' s important .
tell me .
ricky says that he saw ... a man with a pistol .
but , of course , he was just kidding .
i gotta go to the toilet .
the sweaty guy with the handkerchief ?
yeah .
this is very serious , ricky .
we' re in the same boat , same plane that is .
where did he have it ?
yeah , i see the bulge .
you saw it for real .
yeah , i did .
you could be a hero , ricky .
save the plane .
come on , pal , we better check this out , show me .
no , i' m not going anywhere with you .
that guy has a gun back there .
just show me .
come on .
go , go .
you walk by , fall on him and trip for the gun , ok ?
no way .
why don' t you do it ?
what can he do to you ?
shoot me .
ok , just walk and look and see if you can see it inside his jacket .
you' re going to the toilet and walking by , that' s all .
go .
sorry , sorry , sir .
well , watch where you' re going .
sorry , turbulence .
toilet ... yes , in front .
i saw it , i saw it , i did .
i sure felt it this time .
it' s real reality , all right ?
what do we do ?
i' m not sure .
we gotta tell somebody .
like a grown up .
who ?
no one will believe us .
yeah , we' re just crazy kids , but we' re safe , no ?
the pilot has a gun , right ?
i don' t know .
he' s locked in the cockpit .
the guy can' t get in .
if we die , i don' t wanna look back and wish we' d done something .
how do we put him out of action ?
game is up , kato .
how did you find me ?
that' s a national security matter ...
i' m not authorized to discuss with scum like you .
only a scum with the highest security clearence .
give me your hot sauce case .
you hate spicy .
just ...
chicken or pasta ?
pasta , please .
keep your trays down , thank you .
here you go .
be careful with that one ... if you' re not used to it .
it' s got a delayed kick .
we' il both have the pasta , please .
this is my job .
it looks good .
it might be my last meal .
hot , hot .
go ahead , you can eat .
what is he doing ?
stop it , luke , eat your food .
use your words , honey .
do you want to throw up ?
this is mild stuff .
if you' d used this , it would' ve killed him .
good we moved .
potty , go potty .
ok , baby , here we go .
trial run a success .
we need the strongest to take out the big monster .
which is it ?
well ... with this ... you run the risk of being accused of murder .
it' s self defense .
like a preemptive strike ?
right , but , how do we get it into his food ?
quick , the food cart' s close to him .
come on .
you said we had to do something .
come here .
if we do them all , he' il get one .
we can' t kill innocent people .
though , sometimes , you have to sacrifice a few to save the many .
chicken or pasta ?
pasta .
give me pasta .
lost the top to my ... soda bottle .
actually , my contact lens .
here it is .
did you do any ?
no , all i had was chicken .
but he took pasta , what do we do ?
i don' t know .
the concept was good .
the execution was lacking .
come on , like we' re going to the bathroom .
you want something to drink ?
stewardess , do you have any hot sauce ?
i' m sorry , not in economy class .
the sauce is rather spicy though , and you have pepper .
he likes hot food .

<i>there' s a food fight backe here . </ i>
<i>we need help . </ i>

i' m only a heart surgeon .
not " the " dr. bernardi of general memorial ?
yes .
i' m just back from hawaii , first vacation in 10 years .
thank god , dr.
he' s a heart patient .
dr. bruno , here , did his best , but he' s only a ... small animal veterinarian .
i thought you said you were a large animal vet .
i fibbed .
our only chance to save this man' s life is to operate immediatly .
do you have a medical kit ?
yes , dr. , but ... security' s removed any sharp instruments ...
like scalpels .
do you have any cutlery ?
plastic .
that' il have to do .
two knives , one fork and a spoon .
wait , better make that three spoons .
right away , dr.
dr , can you save my father ?
i can' t be sure , young missy ... until i' ve opened up this sucker .
so , let' s get cut .
that was close .
what do we do ?
we could hide in the toilet .
been there , done that .
they' il look there first .
overhead racks ?
we' re too heavy .
they must be in first , like i thought .
we' re almost there now , let me check to see where they are .
be careful .
they' re coming .
follow me .
what' s this ?
a safe place .
how do you know all this ?
my dad' s taken me to maintenance a million times ... and shown me all over .
spooky .
he' s back in first class .
did he see you ?
no .
you sure ?
no .
we better hide .
quick .
look at his neck , it' s tangled up in that chain .
don' t !
come here , come here .
easy .
it' s ok .
it' s ok , it' s ok .
come on , hurry , let' s go .
come on .
we can make like a little house , be totally hidden .
right .
here' s a good one that can cover us like a door .
i know you' re down here and you' re in big trouble .
it sounds a lot like bruno .
that idiot .
that' s all we need now .
help me !
help me !
thanks , guys .
are you ok ?
yeah .
transglobal 40 , this is washington center .
<i>descend at pilot' s discretion</ i> <i>to maintain 5 . 000 feet . </ i>
2 9 3 7 . </ i>
pilot' s discretion to 5 . 000 , leaving 3 3 0 now .
you hear that ?
we' re starting our descent .
we' re gonna make it .
only a few minutes more .
where are we ?
we' re almost there , we' re heading down .
by the way , wasn' t ricky sitting over there ?
they probably found some place to lie down .
good boy .
he' s coming .
just be still .
you sure ?
darn , i was stupid !
we' re trapped here .
we' re well hidden .
i hope .
we' re landing soon .
that can be the most dangerous time .
stay here .
stop it !
it' s the incan mask .
the stolen mask .
he wasn' t a hijacker .
he' s a kidnapper .
what ?
i don' t understand .
didn' t you hear about that girl who was missing ?
well , there' s a gold incan mask missing too .
that' s it , i tell you .
is there a reward , do you think ?
did he put it back in the suitcase ?
no , i' m pretty sure he put in one of those black computer bags .
why ?
why did he ...
of course !
if he had it in his handluggage it would' ve been seen by x ray .
but leaving the plane , nobody checks you .
and maybe there' re others .
and he' s double crossing them .
there' s that flight attendant who' s in on it .
we have to tell someone .
right .
this is different now .
i have the cell phone my parents gave me for the trip .
yeah , like call 911 , right ?
no , that' s not a bad idea .
kato' s not getting off the plane until we land , that' s for sure .
if we warn the pollice , they can be at the gate ... and check everyone leaving the plane .
we can tell them about kato .
reward time !
come on , it' s not over yet .
go ahead and call them , mary jo .
first i have to see if it works .
911 .

see if kato is back there .
go to my father and tell him about the mask .
nothing about the gun .
why don' t you go tell him ?
believe , he won' t believe me .
why should i believe you if he won' t ?

get off this line we were supposed to have ... the most secure communication system in the world .
<i>this is transglobal 40 . </ i>
the kid' s obviously been listening .
he' s some sort of hacker .
i' ve got more than 50 souls on board .
<i>my database says that ... </ i>
<i>andrews air force base</ i> <i>is the best option . </ i>
wait a minute , the pilot said he saw kids in the cockpit .
good christ !
<i>whoever this is , identify yourself . </ i>

my son has one .
<i> andrews is out , whoever you are . </ i>

i told you .
i told you .
ok , let' s talk .
just tell me what you and your people want .
i' m sure we can work something out .

what i' d like is , you to put a qualified adult in line ... and give me some back up just in case .
a pilot who knows the 777 .
ok , richard , we' re on it .
we' re requesting you a pilot to assist you while we figure out a place to land .
<i>transglobal 40, </ i> <i>what' s your fuel status ? </ i>
4 . 600 pounds .
<i>they' re here . </ i>
they' ve probably burned ... any reserve with that detour .
they should be more than ok to metro .
that' s just what the kid said .
<i>change redio frequency now</ i> <i>to metro .
120 .
1 . </ i>
there' s a pilot there to assist you .
this kid has a string unexcused absences from pt .
clearly some kind of a misfit .
<i>transglobal 40, </ i> <i>this is captain exupery . </ i>
<i>do you copy ? </ i>
he' s only got fuel enough for one pass , if that .
that' s about 6 minutes from ... from now .
we' re gonna need vectors to a straight in final approach .
whoever is talking , that' s the right call .
roger that , transglobal 40 .
we' re clearing all the runaways .
holding all traffic .
you' re about 5 minutes out .

we' il take off now .
that' s an order .
yes , sir .
you' re the boss .
that gives us one chance .
i can see you intercepting .
now engage autoland .
we' ve captured the localizer for runway one right .
i think .
we' ve got you .
runway one right .
it' s ok , we' re locked in ,
the plane will land itself .
i see the runway .

is anyone in the tower ?
son , you did a good job .
let' s just try another coupling approach .
i don' t if i' ve got enough fuel to do a whole approach .
son ... can you fly this aircraft manually ?
for god' s sake , no !
put him on auto .
he' s just a kid .
he has no chance .
they can go down in town ...
just decide .
every second we lose ...
can you hand fly the plane , son ?
i don' t know .
<i>get her up to 600 feet . </ i>
<i>then sharp bank to the right . </ i>
<i>flame at right engine . </ i>
no , our right engine flamed out .
<i>turn now , and then line it . </ i>
330 degrees .
<i>that' s it , boy . </ i>
<i>approaching the localizer . </ i>
<i>select autoland again . </ i>
<i>come on , select autoland again . </ i>
<i>are your flaps down ? </ i>
what about the gear ?
<i>very good . </ i>
<i>that' s it , you' re down . </ i>

well done , junior pilot .
what happened ?
it' s ok .
it' s ok , sir .
we' ve landed .
you did it , ricky !
i' m not gonna say anything else about you being spacey casey again .
a souvenir .
did you know they were on board with her ?
no , it was just a lucky coincidence .
but it does show the value of having air marshals on board .
capitain , what happened ?
it' s her !
what you did was very ...
i' m so proud of you , son .
i guess you don' t have to play football to be a hero .
you sure showed me .
i believe this is yours .
well , sir , this is one treasure .
but , the greater treasure is my daughter .
i owe you her life .
perhaps you don' t know , but i announced a reward ... a sizeable reward for the return of both .
you' re a wealthy man .
no , sir , the reward doesn' t belong to me , but this gentle ... well ... this person .
thank you .
ok , no .
you' re welcome but , it' s my son , ricky ... who not only saved your daughter but all of us on the plane ... by landing it .
it' s true , he did !
it was all of us .
if there' s any reward , it should go to keep our arts program going ... keep our teachers teaching and us kids making music .
what did you say ?
hands up .
turn .
what are you doing ?
we should be on underway in a few moments now ... and we look forward to a smooth flight tonight .
bye bye .
