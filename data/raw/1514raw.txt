the film which you are about to see is an account of the tragedy which befell a group of 5 youths .
it is all the more tragic in that they were young , but had they lived very , very long lives , they could not have expected , nor would they have wished to see as much of the mad and macabre as they were to see that day .
for them , an idyilic summer afternoon became a nightmare .
for 30 years , the files collected dust in the cold cases division of the travis county police department .
over 1, 300 pieces of evidence were collected from the crime scene at the hewitt residence .
yet none of the evidence was more compelling than the classified police footage of the crime scene walk through .
test , test , test .
ok , uh ... this is august 20 , 1973 .
the time is 3 : 47 p . m .
our location is the hewitt residence on route 17 .
that' s where victim one was found .
we' re gonna do a walk through , and we' re now descending the stairs into the furnace room .
uh ... there' s ... over here .
there' s scratch marks along the wall .
there' s some more over here , right along here .
and ... oh , there' s something over here .
it seems like ... it looks like a clot of hair and an embedded fingernail .
all right , we' re gonna go move into the actual furnace room .
the events of that day were to lead to one of the most bizarre crimes in the annals of american history ... the texas chainsaw massacre .
hold on !

all right , just calm down , ok ?
let me ... i' m sorry .
i apologize .
but , ma' am , i don' t understand .
why the hell won' t the sheriff just come out here ?

he said it would be about 2 hours before he could get here .
we' re not gonna drive around this town with a dead girl in the back of our van !
young man ... what you do is your own business .
come on .

i just want to go home , ok ?

did you smell that nasty beef shit ?
oh , my god .
guys .
hello !
hello ?
ain' t no sheriff here .
i think we should drop off the body and get the hell out of here .
maybe we should vote on it .
kemper , no .
why not , erin ?
it is a democracy .
well , how would you like it if we just dumped your body out here ?
i' m sorry .
nobody asked her to blow her head off in our van .
my van .
i say we dump her .
pig .
cool .
all right .
fine .
2 votes .
now we just need one more .
kemper ?
one more and we' re out of here .
kemper , please ?
baby , she' s dead .
i just ... i really don' t think it matters where we leave her .
well , it matters to me ... if that means anything .
erin , look ... that girl has got parents out there somewhere who' s gonna want her back , not just dumped on the side of the road
like a piece of trash .
you see our lone ranger anywhere ?
maybe this isn' t the crawford mill .
it' s unbelievable .
this is a joke .
there' s nobody here .
there' s no sheriff here .
