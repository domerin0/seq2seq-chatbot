hi .
i' m expecting a letter .
hold for guest arrival .
sure .
what' s your name ?
joan hart .
ah , joan hart .
platinum .
platinum ?
as in platinum record .
as in a million units sold .
now , drive shaft' s albums must' ve ... ... spiked when everybody found out that i died in some catastrophic plane disaster .
but when i come back ?
alive !
it' s gonna be insane .
so you think the raft' s gonna work ?
of course .
look at that thing .
it' s not a raft .
they built a sodding boat .
when they get picked up , the helicopters will come , making us ridiculously and eternally famous .
what' s the matter ?
don' t you want to be famous ?
. . . what i think .
but the fact is . . .
what do you think' s going on over there ?
sure .
you can absolutely wait a few weeks before you launch .
i was just assuming you didn' t want to die .
so , uh , when' s the next time we can launch ?
three ... maybe four months .
come on !
even a weatherman on tv don' t know what' s gonna happen .
why are we listening to arzt ?
because i' m a doctor and you' re a hillbilly .
you' re a damn high school science teacher .
hey , sawyer , let' s just let the man talk .
it' s been raining every afternoon .
that means that we are on the cusp of monsoon season .
monsoon season is bad .
now , the trade winds are blowing north right now .
shipping lanes are north .
so north is exactly where you want to be .
what' s that mean ?
it means , when the monsoon season hits , the trade winds are gonna shift to the south .
the raft goes with the wind .
can anyone tell me what is the only piece of land that' s south of us ?
antarctica .
that' s right , jack .
antarctica .
so when do we have to leave ?
yesterday .
so obviously you believe him .
arzt ?
i don' t know .
but i' m not taking any chances .
you think you' il be ready by tomorrow ?
man said not a day to waste .
supplies all set ?
you got food , fresh water , every ...
look , kate , no offense , but i got work to do .
why the sudden interest ?
because i' m going with you .
look , raft' s full .
we need four , we got four .
look , raft' s full .
we need four , we got four .
lncluding sawyer ?
lncluding him .
we needed the stuff he had , so he bought his way on .
on the first raft , which burned .
i' m not gonna get into semantics .
i told the guy ...
he doesn' t know how to sail .
and you do ?
i spent two summers crewing j l boats .
i know my way around a sailboat .
yeah ... maybe so , but a deal' s a deal .
i' m sorry .
you' re bringing walt too ?
i' m just saying it' s dangerous .
i decide what' s best for my boy .
and right now , what' s best for him is to get the hell off this island .
the raft' s full .
hospital chaplain to the neuro icu .
hospital chaplain .
please report to the neuro icu .
i have a delivery for diane jansen .
right .
she just came up from lcu .
she' s in room 208 .
okay .
around the corner , to your right .
thanks .
you' re welcome .
hey , tom .
holy ...
katie ?
what are you doing here ?
diane' s dying of cancer .
i thought i owed it to her to come see her .
i heard .
i' m sorry .
yeah , me too .
so any particular reason why you' re hanging out in the back of my car ?
i need your help .
how much further ?
we' re almost there .
wanna tell me where we' re going , sayid ?
it' s better that you see it for yourself .
no , i' m not so sure it is .
tell me why you brought me here or i turn around .
he brought you out here because i asked him to .
i asked him not to tell you .
i wanted you to have an open mind .
open mind about what ?
my god .
what is this thing ?
exactly .
i guess it' s time we talked about this .
yo , chief !
dumb question here .
we' re sailing out on the ocean right ?
you mind ?
sulu over here is packing a suitcase full of salted fish .
yeah ?
we can' t catch fish ?
do you know anything about surviving at sea ?
sailing ?
navigating ?
steering a raft ?
do you ?
doesn' t matter what i know , i built it .
maybe you are the wrong guy to go on the raft .
you gonna vote me off , mickey ?
and who the hell' s gonna take my place ?
what the hell you think you' re doing ?
sorry ?
don' t give me the " aw , golly " eyes .
michael just told me you were jockeying for my spot on the raft .
i was just asking some questions .
he must' ve misunderstood me .
i know what you' re doing .
yeah ?
yeah .
just like i know why you wanted that haliburton case so bad .
the one that belonged to the u. s. marshal who was flying with us .
you were his prisoner .
let go of me .
your only chance of running' s getting on that raft , ain' t it ?
lf we get picked up by a ship , when they come back to rescue the rest of y' all , gonna be a nice big asterisk next to your name .
well , don' t worry , puddin ' , your secret' s safe with me .
but just so you know , no way in hell you' re getting my spot on that raft .
hey , sawyer !
i want your spot , i' il get your spot .
hey !
give me that water , man .
yo , dad !
thanks .
so , what were you and sawyer arguing about ?
i told him something he didn' t want to hear .
why does he wanna get on the raft so much ?
' cause he knows it' s gonna work .
when we get rescued , we' re gonna come back for everybody else , right ?
yeah .
sure .
of course .
but the thing is ... ... this island ... ... is ... finding it again might be hard .
can' t we fly around and look for it ?
absolutely .
but there' s no guarantees .
that' s why you and ...
dad ?
ooh .
that' s why you ... [ grunts ]
dad !
dad !
get jack .
help !
i need help !
it' s my dad .
what' s the matter ?
his stomach is really bad .
take him back to michael .
i' il go get jack .
okay .
let' s go .
this way .
jack !
jack !
how long have you known about this ?
three weeks , give or take .
three weeks .
you' ve been out here for three weeks digging this thing up and you never told me ?
all due respect , jack , but since when do i report to you ?
all due respect , john , but you lied .
how long did you have that case full of guns before you decided the rest of us needed to know ?
you used your best discretion .
i used mine .
so how do we open it ?
what ?
you want to open it ?
yeah .
we should bury it .
i brought you here to talk him out of this insanity .
anything could be inside .
best case scenario , there' s supplies .
worst case , we use it as a shelter .
actually , jack , i can think of much worse cases than that .
you notice anything about this hatch ?
there' s no handle .
could the reason for that be more obvious ?
maybe it was never meant to be opened from the outside .
jack !
jack !
yeah !
over here !
it' s michael .
something' s wrong .
what' d you eat today ?
fruit , fish .
drinking enough water ?
two , three bottles .
where are you getting that water from ?
the caves , like everybody else .
all right , listen , michael .
you just take it easy .
you stay in the shade .
you try not to move too much , okay ?
we have to launch that raft tomorrow .
we have to .
i know .
i need you to lay back .
lay down .
just lay down .
okay ?
hello ?
hey , adam .
hey , listen , can you carve out some time for me on the mrl ?
yeah , it' s ... it' s a favor for a friend of a friend .
oh , no , that' il work out great .
okay .
yeah , thanks , adam .
his name' s connor .
how old is he ?
twenty two months next week .
he' s beautiful .
yeah , well , that' s rachel , that' s not me .
where is she ?
she' s over in cedar rapids visiting her folks .
they get back on sunday .
i got diane in for an mrl .
they' il bring her downstairs to radiology .
and her appointment' s not until 5 am , so we' ve got about three hours to kill .
tom ...
you' re welcome .
you think it' s still there ?
what ?
you know what .
it' s the middle of the night , katie .
we might not get another chance .
one , two , three , four , five , six .
what do you think it is ?
heatstroke ?
no .
he would' ve felt that coming on .
bad fruit , maybe ?
raw fish ?
michael and jin are on the same diet .
and jin' s fine .
jin' s fine .
whatever' s making him sick was metabolized fast .
it hit him quick , and it hit him hard .
so you think it was the water ?
no , i don' t think it was the water .
i think it was something in the water .
feeling any better ?
cramps are quieting down .
as long as i don' t move , or ... or breathe .
you and locke kiss and make up ?
good .
no , michael .
what ?
drink from that one .
somebody did this to me ?
i don' t know .
i' m not sure of anything yet .
sawyer .
i' m on bamboo duty , but sometimes i help refill the water .
michael and jin getting along ?
they fight like a married couple building a raft together .
you told him ?
he thinks sawyer might' ve done it .
oh , ' cause of kate ?
kate ?
yeah , i guess she wants on the raft .
so sawyer went off on michael because he gets to decide who goes .
you don' t think kate did it ?
why would kate poison michael ?
well , you know , the whole fugitive thing .
he doesn' t know ?
how am i supposed to keep straight who knows what ?
steve didn' t know about the polar bear .
what did she do ?
i don' t know .
why don' t you ask her ?
you didn' t think the others should know about this ?
discretion , john .
okay , can you stop moving or i' m gonna cut your ear off .
this is good .
i' m writing again .
i' m really feeling it , as well .
so , what' s the first thing you' re gonna do when we get rescued ?
you know , i don' t really know .
you can hang out with me in la .
you and turnip head .
you know , until you figure things out .
thanks .
smashing .
okay .
check this out .
this is track two .
it' s called ...
sorry .
it' s called monster eats the pilot .
how' s michael ?
he' s gonna be fine .
ls somebody gonna be taking his place on the raft ?
i don' t know .
dr. arzt said if they don' t leave ...
did you poison michael , kate ?
what ?
he' s not sick .
someone did this .
do you really think i' m capable of that ?
i don' t know what you' re capable of .
you brought beer ?
no self respecting man in lowa goes anywhere without beer .
it' s not fair , you know , you coming back .
here .
home .
yeah , i know .
wow .
wow !
look at this stuff .
oh , my god !
my plane .
i can' t believe i let you talk me into putting this in there .
that was your idea .
kate and tom .
1 989 .
is it on ?
i don' t think it' s on .
it' s on .
okay , uh , this is kate austen and tom brennan .
and this is our dedication for our time capsule here on august 1 5th , 1989 .
hey , give me that back !
why are you putting this stupid plane in there ?
because it' s cool , katie .
i got it when i flew to dallas by myself .
ooh , that is cool !
just like this time capsule .
it' il be totally cool when we dig it up in , like , 20 years .
how do you know we' il be together ?
' cause we' il be married .
you' il be a mom
and we' il have nine kids .
i don' t think so .
as soon as i get my license , we should just get in a car and drive .
like , you know , run away .
you always wanna run away , katie .
yeah .
and you know why .
funny how things turn out , huh ?
yeah .
sorry .
we better get to the hospital .

what happened ?
i had a little accident .
does it hurt ?
yep .
something you wanna tell me , walt ?
i didn' t do it .
didn' t do what ?
i heard jack .
he thinks somebody got my dad sick .
and i didn' t do it .
you think because i know you burned the first raft
i' d think you made your dad sick ?
we' re friends , aren' t we walt ?
i didn' t tell on you before , and i' m not gonna now .
and i know you would never do anything to hurt your dad .
what' s the matter ?
don' t open it .
what did you say ?
don' t open it , mr. locke .
don' t open that thing .
what ?
what thing ?
what are you ... ?
just don' t open it !
thought you might need that , boss .
wouldn' t want our pilot out of commission before takeoff .
what ?
you feeling guilty ?
what ?
you' re off the raft .
come again ?
you' re off the raft .
we had a deal .
well , the deal ended the minute you decided to poison me .
i did what now ?
i' m done with you .
you ain' t done with me by a damn sight .
you said you needed four .
i got four .
you' ve been stealing stuff off of dead bodies , keeping it for yourself , using it to buy favors .
you' re a liar and a criminal !
i' m not letting you near my boy !
oh , i' m a criminal ?
i poisoned you ' cause i' m a criminal ?
get your hands off me , boy .

sawyer , please .
you all remember joanna , don' t you ?
huh ?
the woman who drowned ?
now , what' s kate doing with poor joanna' s ld ?
could it be she' d do just about anything to get on that raft , so she could get herself rescued ?
run off with a new identity before half the reporters in the world descend on this damn island ?
she might poison the captain himself .
shut up .
she don' t care about nothing or nobody but herself .

ls that why you tried to make him sick ?
michael and jin working together all the time , pretty easy for them to get their water bottles mixed up .
i didn' t want him to die out there .
i just didn' t know what to do .
i only used enough to make him ...
i wasn' t trying to hurt him .
are you gonna tell the others ?
i don' t see any reason why they need to know .
but sun ... ... he' s going .
lf i were you , i' d ...
i' d say goodbye .
i' m back on the raft .
glad to hear it .
michael' s gonna cowboy up .
we set sail tomorrow .

sorry don' t suit me .
you cornered me , freckles .
i did what i had to .
i cornered you ?
you said if you wanted my spot , you were gonna take it .
guess i believed you .
well ... that' s that .
i got some packing to do .
why is it so important for you to be on that raft ?
' cause there ain' t anything on this island worth staying for .
be safe , sawyer .
yeah .
dad ?
hey , buddy !
you getting better ?
yeah .
yep , i' m gonna be all right .
hey .
don' t worry .
i' m gonna be on my feet soon and we' il be sailing home before you can even ...

yeah .
