that was the boring side .
you can' t really judge in one hour .

he can' t care anyway .
he believed you .
even better .
i' ve got a headache .

its a girl ...
a crazy case .
nobody .
has it been going on for long ?
it was of no importance .
of no importance ?
come on !
catherine , its not worth it .
ok , you don' t have to say anything .
i thought you placed yourself higher .
what ?
does it happen so often then ?
of course not .
not often .
but once in a while , yes .
its ridiculous , thats why i' m not telling you .
is that the reason ?
i understand you' re hurt , but ...
if you' d know how i' d feel ...
i don' t care !
you' re right .
maybe we talk too little .
but you don' t say anything about yourself either .
we' ve grown away from each other .
you' ve grown away .
don' t talk about me .
its true .
we don' t make love anymore don' t touch anymore ...
i don' t know if its because of me or you .
maybe its unavoidable ...
and one day it dies away .
i hope not .
how is it going then with those women ?
what do you like ?
actually i don' t know anything about it .
i' m not going to tell you how i ...
yes you are .
then we' il share something .
what do you mean ?
i can leave you immediately too .
catherine .
are you looking for somebody ?
no .
can i do something for you ?
this is a private club .
a whiskey please .
sit over there .
the whiskey , with perrier ?
no , pure .
you always get things in your mind .
you' re so irritating .
who did you get that from ?
from my sweetheart .
you' re in a hurry aren' t you ?
a glass of water , i' m hot .
its quiet tonight .
yea , it will get started .
d' you want ice ?
yes please .
its fine like that .
there aren' t any people yet .
when does it usually start ?
eleven , half twelve .
d' you offer me something to drink ?
if you want .
everthing fine ?
not too strange ?
its okey .
which perfume d' you have on ?
jicky .
it suits you .
i constantly change .
did you just come in by coincidence ?
no , not really .
i work in the neighbourhood .
you seldom see women here .
women like you i mean .
probably .
couples yes , but a woman alone ...
would you prefer that i leave you alone ?
no .
maybe ... you can help me .
why not .
tell me .
some girls don' t go with women .
i do .
its not for me .
for who then ?
i think ... that my husband would like you ...
you choose in his place ?
can' t he come himself ?
no .
why not ?
is he handicapped ?
d' you want a threesome ?
no , he knows nothing about this .
didn' t you recognise me ?
i wasn' t sure .
a coffee please .
his name is bernard .
<i>he often goes for a coffe</ i> <i>before work . </ i>
<i>how shall i describe him ? </ i>
<i>he wears a blue scarf, </ i> <i>a dark jacket . </ i>
<i>a couple of newspapers ... </ i>
<i>he is big , brown hair , strong . </ i>
<i>you could call him attractive . </ i>
<i>and if he asks what i do ? </ i>
<i> you learn languages to become a translator . </ i>
excuse me , d' you have a light ?
i was asking for a light .
and i sat down again .
he pretended as if he was reading .
but then he stood up , and approached me .
what did he say ?
the usual .
if i cam there often , to my work ...
i told him about the language courses .
he said he had to go to an appointment and asked for my name .
i didn' t answer .
we have to think of a name .
i don' t know if marlne is your real name .
we' il call you ...
nathalie ... yes , nathalie .
what does your husband like ?
what gives him pleasure ?
he has his own wishes .
its always free between us ... been classic .
maybe he likes to be hugged .
how did he look at you ?
he fell fast .
you chose well .
shall i pay you now ?
yes .
you can check .
no , its fine .
how are you getting home , yolaine ?
with a taxi .
no , i' il give you a lift .
this dinner has to unify our loneliness we both have .
but it doesn' t subject you to anything of course .
come .
see you , yolaine .
see you , franois .
franois had a lot to tell you .
i asked about his love life .
that must have been something .
he' s going for the ' adventure ' why not ?
he' s not going further .
he pays .
he is scared and runs away .
he' s scared of a real relationship .
and you ?
do you sometimes sleep with a prostitute ?
why d' you ask that ?
you can say if you like .
no , thats nothing for me .
why ?
i find it disgusting .
have you had a good day ?
um , no .
i had an important appointment and it was terrible .
i didn' t like the others thoughts so was screwing around .
as a result : it ended .
gryner was perplexed .
and you ?
i was finished early .
i went to buy shoes .
quite expensive .
are you still reading ?
no .
mum ?
aren' t you sleeping ?
of course not .
then maybe you should get up .
getting up or not , what difference does it make ?
no , please .
its midday and the sun is shining .
you can ask nora to clean up .
absolutely not .
she steals stuff .
what ?
towels , cutlery ...
but i have to keep quiet .
you should fire here since you' re paying her .
how evil that person is .
disgraceful . !
your husband called me .
very charming .
we asked ourselves why we never saw each other .
you never want to leave the house .
or you obstruct it .
he' s busy , he' s often travelling .
he' s quite funny though .
he got me laughing after two sentences .
you' re lucky .
such a cute guy .
yea , he can definitely show himself .
you never talk about it .
maybe you find it normal , but ...
he' s been cheating on me for years .
yea , that sucks .
but its not unusual .
is it tasty ?
yes very nice .
hello .
d' you want to drink something ?
coke .
a coke please .
everything alright ?
yes .
we saw each other again .
he was sitting in the same place .
with his coffee and newspapers .
he had to go off to work and gave me a date before lunch .
he paid for a drink .
but it was very busy .
so he suggested a different place .
we went to a hotel .
the bar of a hotel ?
no , to a room .
how so , to a room ?
yes , it happened automatically .
he got what he wanted .
you went to bed with him ?
yes .
thats not it !
thats not what i asked for !
what then ?
i didn' t ask you to get down on him .
he came down on me , as if he hadn' t fucked in 10 years .
you understood me wrongly .
it was decided .
you' re a normal average girl , nathalie .
after how much time does your nathalie go to bed ?
i don' t know what you want .
sorry .
i made a mistake .
hurry up , we' il be too late .
is there something ?
go without me , i don' t feel too well .
don' t do that to me now .
i thik i' m getting a flu .
are you angry ?
why would i be ?
people say these things ... which they don' t want to say .
d' you want an aspiririne ?
i already took one .
i' il be back early .
good night .
d' you want to drink something ?
a whiskey please .
i have to go now , but i' il be back .
what d' you want ?
sorry about this morning .
its ok .
you didn' t say it .
what ?
the hotel , the room , how it went .
sorry , i don' t have time .
i paid you .
come .
we' il change clothes here .
lets think ...
it was a nice room .
with red colours ..
at first there was no hesitation ... maybe because it went so fast .
we took something from the minibar .
i said nothing .
he neither .
but i saw from his look that he really wanted me .
he looked at my breasts .
i stretched a little .
he understood that i wanted him to have his way with me .
i unbuttoned my blouse and styled my hair as if i didn' t know my blouse would fall open .
he came to me .
i felt his breathing .
i think he was already very excited .
then he grabbed me by the neck and asked me to lie down on the bed naked with my eyes closed .
he turned off the lights , except in the bathroom .
then he took off his clothes .
i didn' t see him , but i felt his eyes cast on me .
he lay down on me .
i felt his mouth in my neck , his tongue on my breasts .
and then here .
shall i continue ?
he wanted to take my immediately , but i found that too fast .
i stood up and took another glass .
i was thirsty .
he came behind me .
he stood against my back .
i started to move my thighs .
he took his cock in his hand and touched me all over .
he asked if i liked it .
he wanted to hear me say it .
then i gave him a condom and he came inside me .
he barely moved , as if he was scared to cum too soon .
suddently he pulled himself out and took me to the bed .
there i slowly jerked him off , carefully .
i didn' t want him to cum immediately .
then i went on top .
i thrust my head backwards .
often men don' t want to be stared at .
they concentrate on what excites them .
how long did it last ?
i don' t remember .
quite long .
when he came to orgasm , he supressed his scream .
i think he enjoyed it .
and you ?
how did you feel ?
it did excite me some how that he didn' t know you were behind all this .
but for the rest nothing .
when i' m with a customer , i don' t feel anything .
did he notice it ?
i pretend .
thats my job .
now i must leave .
hi alice .
hi madam .
everything alright ?
yes thank you .
hi madam .
come along .
was it here the first time also ?
with me its not alright , and with you ...
he was too late .
he hadn' t had lunch .
did he order that ?
he doesn' t like vouvray .
i do .
d' you want some ?
its my glass .
thank you .
tasty no ?
did it happen before ?
before and after .
sit down .
this time he undressed me .
but not completely .
i cam from the other side of the room slowly moving towards him whilst i gave him a tight look .
i stroked my nipples
he came closer .
then he started licking them and bit them softly .
he then placed his fingers in my mouth .
he has nice hands , and a nice skin .
you think so ?
yes .
its a soft skin .
i took his hand and brought it between my thighs .
he went inside my underwear and pushed his fingers inside .
it was quite brutal , but expert like .
i closed my legs .
he liked me giving resistance .
he penetrated me .
it lasted a long time .
and then he came to orgasm .
this time without supressing a scream .
he didn' t want me to leave .
didn' t he go back to the office ?
not immediately .
he was tired and fell asleep .
i waited til he breathed normally again .
i had a cream in my handbag .
i put some in the palm of his hands .
this smell .
i stroked his cock with it .
i put some on my stomach .
when i felt he was about to cum , i grabbed him and fucked him .
then i kissed him , quickly .
i thought he' d like it .
after that we smoked a cigarette .
he gently took my hand .
i still had appointments and wanted to get up .
i don' t want you to leave .
a girl like nathalie would have stayed right ?
is that how you see nathalie ?
about like that , yes .
watch out .
he lies like anything .
he isn' t allowed to dump you immediately .
i don' t expect that .
living in a hotel must be nice .
was he talking about me ?
he said he had a woman whom he loved deeply .
yes , apparently he really loves me .
have you been doing this for long ?
i don' t keep count .
at what time do you start ?
at seven .
how many days a week ?
normally four .
more is possible too , if i want .
you smell good .
what fragrance is that ?
d' you like it ?
i bought it today .
no , i' m exhausted .
she' s there .
shall we go ?
see you later .
everything alright ?
yes , with you ?
bitch !
talking about bitches , d' you know what i had to do ?
a woman wanted the exact same spots as you .
the previous week she came too .
make up marilyn monroe .
for the lips she wanted help from me .
did you see him ?
<i>yes , but i was on the point of not going . </ i>
how come ?
<i>i had a problem .
women' s things . </ i>
<i>but he still wanted to go to the hotel . </ i>
he wanted me to undress , but i refused to .
he could touch me under my clothes i said .
<i>but he wanted to cum together or not . </ i>
<i>he asked questions about my life . </ i>
<i>i just made up some stuff . </ i>
<i>he also told a lot about himself . </ i>
<i>and abou you . </ i>
he had the feeling that at present you were somewhere far away .
i asked myself if he knew about it , if he was violent .
<i>how he would react . </ i>
<i>hello ? </ i>
i' m still here .
<i>am i bothering ?
are you free tonight ? </ i>
no .
not tonight .
<i>pity .
i' m not working . </ i>
come eat something .
come catherine .
til later .
i' il call you .
who was it ?
your mother ?
big secret .
everything ok ?
eat , it' il get cold .
now that we' re with the three of us .
how was he ?
calm ?
yes .
he saw people he knew and waved to them .
what kind of people ?
a couple .
was it a young woman ?
and old one ?
like you .
he found it annoying that they saw him .
i was wearing this skirt .
my shoulderband was constantly sliding off .
one time he did it good again and stroked my shoulder .
i took his hand under the table and slid it through my thighs upwards .
i wasn' t wearing any underwear .
he noticed .
he hesitated , but didn' t do anything .
and suddenly he got what he wanted .
i told him i was going to the bathroom ... and that he should join me over there .
i waited a few minutes in the ladies room with the door ajar .
i wasn' t sure if he' d come .
just when i wanted to go back upstairs he came .
we went inside the cabin .
he pushed me against the wall and kissed me bitingly in the neck .
he opened up my legs .
then a woman wanted to come inside but he blocked the door shut .
we were thrown out of the restaurant as if we were thieves .
it was all for nothing .
no .
we walked through the street .
he constantly looked at me , as if he still wanted to ask me something but wasn' t sure how to put it .
i felt he was still excited .
we walked through a carriage gate
there was a patio behind that ... with a some small stairs .
i went to sit over there .
he stayed on his feet .
motionless , without touching me .
i took my dress off .
i was stark naked .
we didn' t care about people passing by .
i went up the stairs .
he came after me .
we heard voices coming out of the rooms .
on the last step i leant against the window .
there he took me .
he fucked me .
it was hefty .
and then ... something happened .
nathalie also cummed .
nathalie ... you ?
with me it never happens whilst i work .
but you did enjoy .
that' s your fault .
do you still love him ?
i don' t know .
please , madam .
thank you .
your mother called .
i' il call her back .
can you help a sec ?
of course .
how old were you when you had your first period .
fourteen .
and your job ?
dancer .
classical ballet .
d' you use preservatives ?
no .
d' you want a child ?
absolutely not .
don' t you take any precautions whilst having sex then ?
i' ve never done it before .
i' m listening .
i tried it once .
it was a disaster .
i couldn' t .
it hurt so much i got into a panic .
i don' t know if i am like everybody .
see you miss .
thank you .
hi alice .
see you tomorrow .
hi madam .
what are you doing here ?
i saw your sign .
i hesitated but decided to come .
was that wrong
no .
i' il get changed .
do you also get girls like me ?
sometimes .
i couldn' t , we know each other .
i shouldn' t have come .
this is my job .
did you see him again ?
yes .
we can talk about it later .
we' re here now already .
i don' t want to speak about it here .
start already .
ok .
what happened today ?
oh yes , i had to sit on my hands and feet .
he pulled my thighs apart .
with lack of some type of lube he spat .
i want your ass , i' m going to take you .
i let him his way ...
you can stop now .
are you shocked ?
you wanted all the details .
is that how he really talks ?
vulgar words like that are nothing to him .
not my fault .
and you gabble it off like that ...
its slutty in ...
slutty ?
yes , and then ?
you have no idea what they all saw .
he is not a customer like any other .
you are no customer as any other .
it can' t work every time .
what d' you mean ?
i can' t help that i get excited .
i know thats how you make your living
but your tricks to excite men will surely not work with everybody .
you could better leave .
go look for somebody else .
as you see i' m back in real estate , my first profession ,
ok , its still quite empty , but the potential is enormous .
i didn' t invite you for no reason .
i' m in search of resources .
you saw , and now the appraisal comes , that the area is flourishing .
its blooming amazingly .
my wife .
good evening .

yes , and very glad .

it did give me pleasure though .

and quite rough too .

i thought we were done .

i was in the mood .
i thought i wasn' t going to see you again .
we had talked .
i had a dreadful day .
i was just put out of my flat .
he was very sweet , he listened .
that gave pleasure .
he acted as if your problems hurt him .
no , not acted .
and where are you sleeping now ?
he offered to hire something for me .
but you refused .
i told him i' d think about it .
i' d find it awkward against you .

<i>he wanted to cum on my face . </ i>
<i>i asked myself whether you' d want that . </ i>
<i>l hesitated . </ i>
<i>and then i said yes .
but shyly . </ i>
<i>as if it was the first time . </ i>
<i>he came and stood above me . </ i>
<i>and jerked himself off . </ i>
<i>i got it all over my face . </ i>
<i>it was warm . </ i>
<i>and then he left again . </ i>
<i>i stayed alone, </ i> <i>naked in the room . </ i>
<i>i must have slept for a while . </ i>
<i>i drank something , i was thirsty . </ i>
<i>i wanted to call you , but ... </ i>

i thought you wouldn' t like that .
i also prefer you do it elsewhere with the others .
ok .
he' s quite calm with me .
i don' t know whats going on inside him .
he went crazy in the flat .
he thought i had somebody else .
i couldn' t really say it was you .
poor devil .
he was jealous .
i actually like that though .
did you feel flattered ?
not only that .
with men jealousy is a reflex .
and after that everything was alright again ?
yes .
he undressed you ...
he was excited , you gave him a blowjob , he fucked you .
no , he couldn' t .
i saw him suffering and didn' t insist .
but it did touch me somehow .
how so , touched you ?
he felt he was using me and didn' t want that .
because he respects you in such a way ...
i think he' s serious .
no .
he wants to live together with me .
he couldn' t have possibly said that ?
why ?
if he knows who you are ...
tell him , then we' il see .
naked in a hotel room its possible , but in his world ...
what' s special about it , except that no more fucking happens ?
i couldn' t care less about him anymore .
thats not true , otherwise you would have left him .
i' il see you later .
come , there' s a table over there .
a glass of champagne ?

he wants to leave me .
you were right .
he does want to leave me .

no .
not with so many words .
but i feel it .
he really keeps his distance .
and acts cool .
he heardly says anthing .

this is a cheap joke .
now you won' t believe me anymore .

i' m hurrying .
and what if we didn' t go ?
