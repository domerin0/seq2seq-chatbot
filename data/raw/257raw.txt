refrigerator .
i want to show you something , mr. beck , please .
does that iook iike a refrigerator to you ?
looks more iike heil .
where you see heil , i see a speilbinding sense of purpose .
i see the value of keeping your eye on the bail .
when a bride slips the ring on her finger ... ... when a businessman lays his hands on a rolex ... ... when a rapper gets a shiny new tooth , this is that cost , mr. beck .
my horror for their beauty .
my heii for their iittle slice of heaven .
somebody' s gotta keep his eye on the ball .
that somebody is me , mr. beck .
i am down here every day keeping my eye on the ball .
that' s just a simple fact of life .
and if you' re bold enough to face that cold , hard fact ... ... you can make a iot of money .
what do you want with the kid ?
i' ve come to take him home .
that' ii cost you $ 1 0, 000 .
i need to borrow the jeep .

i mean , big boy , there' s always an option c.
so angry !

an unexpected twist , you might say .
can i have a beer , please ?
mr. hatcher , i was just gonna come find you when this
the kid stays .
i paid you .
weil , fortunately ... ... i had my fingers crossed the whole time .
apparently , young mr. walker ... ... may have stumbled onto a trinket of value .
and as he' s iocated it in my jungle ... ... i' m gonna need him to iead me to it .
okay , so iet' s go , dickhead .
don' t caii me a dickhead , you dickhead .

oh , yeah ?
walk .
don' t make waves .
you' re gonna kiii us ail , mr. beck ?

we can buy seed , irrigate .
farm our own iands .
free ourselves from hatcher' s mine .
when that statue hits the black market , it' ii vanish forever .
it' s a iittle iate for morals .
especiaily after you were going to do the same thing .
and 1 0 percent of that is going to pay for your freedom ... ... so i' d be a iittle more gratefui if i were you .

i suppose now we have a conversation where you enlighten me .
mr. hatcher .
how many more of you are out there ?
enlighten me .
where are the rest of your compadres ?

mr. hatcher .
what ?
we' ve iost contact with outpost 1 .
there' s nobody answering .
mr. hatcher , are you out there ?
what can i do for you , mr. beck ?
i have no desire to fight with you or your men .
for that reason , you have two options .
option a , you leave the gato and the girl ... ... and you walk out of town , no questions asked .
what' s option b ?
option b ... ... i make you .
wrong choice .
lock down the town .
still no visual contact .
team two is checking the perimeter right now .
he ... ... that heard the sound of thy holy trumpet ... ... and took not warning ... ... he hath clearly wandered too far ... ... from the word of god .
and cornelius bernard hatcher ... ... your heir has come .
let' s get it on , big boy !
it' s time to get back on the path .
that' s a iot of cows .

option a doesn' t work for me .
