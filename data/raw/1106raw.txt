come on !
hurry up !
these are the headdresses ... ... of the queens that have gone before us .
they come from indian holy ground ... ... the jungles of the ancients ... ... prairies of the norwegians ... ... and the forests of the mighty amazons .
the royal crowns of our people .
this is the blood of our people .
the wolf people ... ... the alligator people ... ... and the moon women ... ... from which we gain our strengths to rule all worlds .
its okay , its just chocolate .
teensy melissa whitman , i declare you ... ... princess naked as a jaybird .
caro eliza bennett , i crown you duchess soaring hawk .
necie rose kelleher , i crown you countess singing cloud .
and i , viviane joan abbott , am hereby and forever ... ... queen dancing creek .
wait .
i dont think we should cut ourselves with that knife .
silence !
we are the flames of the fires , the whirling of the winds .
we are the waters of the rains and the rivers and the oceans .
we are the rocks and the stones .
and now , by the power invested in me , i declare ... ... we are the mighty ya ya priestesses .
let no man put us under .
now our blood flows through each other as its done for all eternity .
loyal forever .
we raise our voices in the words of mumbo gumbo .
ya ya !
ya ya !
my mother .
what can i say about my mother ?
theres nobody like vivi abbott walker .
shell be the first one to tell you that .
mom was loaded with charm , looks , the whole package .
but damaged .
wounded .
the most charming wounded person ever .
wounded ?
how ?
by the times as much as anything .
she had star quality .
she wanted a bigger life than being a cotton farmers wife with four kids .
i dont know .
shes just too complex .
she can be alarmingly simple ... ... and then , suddenly dark and complicated .
sidda , is that it ?
we dont want to burn the place down .
is that it ?
thats exactly it .
but she danced her way through it .
everybody smoked too much , drank too much , fought too much .
the women manipulated , the men hid out , huddled in their duck camps ... ... waiting for the storm to pass .
and yet , it seems like theyre mostly having fun .
when you saydark , you mean angry ?
violent ?
no .
even though she knew how to handle a switch or a belt .
oh , no !
they came from thespare the rod , spoil the childphilosophy .
what ?
i owe all my creativity to her .
if my childhood was easy , id have nothing to write about .
the daughter of a tap dancing , child abuser of a mother ... ... and a distant , emotionally absent fath ...
oh , shit !
oh , shit , connor !
god , this is a disaster .
its a little harsh .
i didnt mean it that way !
calm down .
you dont understand .
give me a xanax .
please .
opening nights only , babe .
and thats your rule .
all i can say is , i hope this is not a real emergency ... ... because i only brought one bottle of vodka .
vivi ?
were here !
i got this .
that ungrateful bitch !
whod have thought shed be the one to do me in ?
here , bebe , take a swallow .
it needs tabasco .
oh , my god .
how ? !
how could she do it ?
she was supposed to be the good one !
you know how long i was in labor with her ?
two hours , not even .
well , it felt longer !
never speak to time magazine .
that writer probably trumped that up .
those yankees like to make us out to be alligator wrestling bigots .
you should call sidda , get the facts .
teensy , since you quit drinking , you dont think .
how can i possibly call somebody who no longer exists ?
get the phone .
oh , my god , thats her .
do not pick up the phone .
connor , dont pick up the phone !
connor , dont !
dont do it .
hello ?
hello , connor .
hello , vivi , how are you ?
well , just lovely .
thank you for asking .
is she there ?
why did you do that ?
shes fine .
talk to her .
mama ?
give it to me !
give it to me !
sidda , shell have to call you back .
tell her shes dead !
shes dead to me !
well , what did she say ?
im sick and tired of her tantrums and drunken rages !
i heard the ice in the glass , mama !
sounds of my happy childhood !
why do you let her get to you ?
hi , mom , love you too , see you later ?
whats wrong with that ?
with normal people , youd be right !
but vivi walker ...
whos a grown woman ...
has never gotten over anything in her privileged , booze soaked life !
shep !
shep , come here !
oh , my god , shes gonna do it .
what ?
look , shes gonna marry that boy .
i mean , that man .
one : does that mean you two are speaking ?
and two : how much is it gonna cost me ?
when is it ?
and where is it ?
dont answer it , its her .
dont !
hello , vivi !
well , hello , connor .
did you call to talk to sidda or to hang up ?
tell her i received the invitation ... ... and all ill be sending is my condolences to you .
ill say to you exactly what id say to my own mother : grow up .
same thing goes for you .
both of you are acting like children .
did she just hang up on me ?
she hung up on me .
how has your old man hung in there for forty odd years ?
for one thing , she moved out of the bedroom sometime in the60s ... ... so hes had a lot of time to himself .
what , he snores ?
he breathes .
there are some things that are none of our business ... ... and we should stay out of it .
but i didnt mean this .
we have an extreme situation here .
and that requires extreme measures .
we cant be afraid to do what we know we have to do .
ya ya .
ya ya !
surprise , surprise .
mamas henchmen .
connor !
come here and meet the ya yas .
you dont seem surprised .

its not gonna work .
listen , petit bebe ... ... no one on earth understands better than us how crazy your mama is .
we wont dispute that .
shes mad as a hatter .
that wont change .
preaching to the choir .
shes been like that .
sidda , the very fact that your mama is the way she is , if you really knew ... ... its nothing less than a triumph of the will .
did you saywillorpill ?
dont take that tone .
you want to get all scrappy , deal with me .
that is just it !
i dont want to getall scrappy .
im sick of fighting .
im sick to death of thiscenter of the universe , holier than thou ... ... nothing is ever enough , oh , how ive suffered ... ... fix me a drink , hand me a nembutal , worn out scarlett oharathing !
shes got her pegged all right .
i am finished !

a ya ya mission of mercy .
an intervention .
why me ?
ive been in therapy for 15 years .
with a professional !
shes the one that needs help .
youre right .
but shes getting old , like all of us .
she is what she is .
but you have a long life ahead of you .
you shouldnt have to spend it angry and resentful .
im not angry !
and my only resentment is yall ... ... disrupting my life because mamas pissed !
all i did was tell the truth !
hold on , im spinning .
whats that doing here ?
more will be revealed .
dont you dare tell her we have it .
theyre not talking , necie .
thats why were all out here .
siddo , kiddo , she doesnt know youre here .
or that we have the book .
thats how it should stay .
but there are some things in there that might ... ... make a difference in how you feel about viviane joan abbott walker .
i dont care if she was whacked over the head by leprechauns .
i just want to get out of here !
you want out ?
that book minus the chip on your shoulder is your ticket back .

petit darling , you were almost a goner , but i think youll make it !
that was stellar .
you had me believing there for a minute .
i knew i hadnt lost my touch .
you look good , willetta .
look like your old self again .
dont be talking about old !
you the one with the birthday around the corner .
dont be talking about birthdays .
you gonna tell me whats wrong ?
or do i have to use what brain cells i got left to figure it out ?
theres nothing wrong .
really .
except ... ... well , sidda .
i wasnt a horrible mother , was i ?
this about that time magazine thing ?
howd you know about that ?
mr. shep tell chaney everything .
and chaney tell me everything .
and i dont tell nobody nothing .
but im going to tell you something right now .
sooner or later ... ... everybodys bill comes due .
you just got to let the child feel the way she feel .
there aint nothing else to do .
shit .
clubs are trump .
its all trumps .
oh , my god .
look at how young yall are .
oh , my god !
i would give anything to know then what i know now .
and to still have those thighs .
im sure theyre still buried in there somewhere .
what in the hell ?
that was when we went to atlanta for the premiere of gone with the wind .
youre joking .
no .
my uncle james invited us .
aunt louise was a big society hoity toity in atlanta .
oh , necie .
oh , my letter .
necie , where were you ?
my parents didnt think willetta was a suitable chaperone ... ... so i missed the big scene .
but your mama , the budding journalist , wrote to me every day .
all two of them .
dearest countess singing cloud ... ... we arrived in atlanta after an eternity on the southern crescent .
they made willetta ride in the colored car ... ... so we were on our own almost the whole way .
girls , get yourselves on upstairs now .
and for heavens sake , get that maid in a uniform right away .
and get that ugly luggage into the house ... ... before somebody thinks we got a bunch of hobos coming to stay .
know what mama says ?
she says uncle james and aunt lou are nouveaux riches .
whats that ?
i dont know .
but its not good .
but , sugaroo ... ... from the looks of this place , nouveau riche is better than no riche .
you never saw so many beautiful things in all your life .
its like a museum , or even a palace .
just think .
all this ... ... and im gonna meet miss margaret mitchell and clark gable too .
i feel like a paris princess .
what yall doing in that tub ?
how are yall supposed to get clean ?
get on out of there !
look at you , all done up in that uniform .
ill take a picture and show everyone at home !
no , you aint .
now , get your clothes on for fancy dinner .
they got it all done up like theys the king of england .
isnt this the most magnificent thing ?
i suppose thats what id be thinking if i was you .
come on .
lord , i done died and gone to hell .
when we went upstairs , our beds were turned down ... ... just like in a fancy hotel .
but even though it was the most exciting night of my life ... ... i had a feeling things werent going so well for willetta .
willetta ?
what you doing down here ?
get yourself back up in that bed .
why are you crying ?
because i misses my family .
you miss maman delia ?
child , your gran aint my family .
i got my own gran .
and my own mama and daddy too .
you want to play cards ?
like at home ?
no , child , i dont want to play no cards .
then how about some hot chocolate ?
will you make me some , willetta ?
child , if you want hot chocolate , go fix it yourself .
james !
why in the world are you wearing that hat in the house ?
will miss mitchell be at the premiere ?
who knows ?
after the junior league denied her membership , shes been unpredictable .
of course , she left us no choice , and shes still steaming .
she brought it on herself with that apache dance .
heres your hot chocolate , just like you likes it .
who told you you could walk your black louisiana ass into our dining room ?
you got ears , nigger ?
get on out of here .
did i hear you right ?
what , yall deaf ?
i heard him loud and clear .
me too .
shut your mouth , you prissy ass little mamas boy !
apologize before i send you back to ...
aunt lou !
let go of her , or ill let that ugly halfwit you call junior have it again !
dont you dare !
oops , slipped .
im sorry , mrs. whitman .
im sorry your son is a baboons ass .
ya ya !
what a wretched woman !
shes dead now , im happy to say .
i never saw my mama so proud as when we stepped off that train .
buggy , on the other hand , made vivi do penance for a month .
she thought for sure shed lost her place in heaven .
worrying about the afterlife is no way to live through this one .
honey , your grandma buggy was about ... ... the unhappiest person i think i have ever seen .
and there was something in vivis very nature that ...
scared the shit out of her .
she was overwhelmed by vivis life force .
nothings changed .
since your mama came into this world ... ... she took up all the space in the room .
thats my brother , jack .
i didnt know you had one .
thats why youre here , bebe , to know what you didnt know .
may i tell you a secret ?
in my prayers ... ... i thank god for granting my son his true love at an early age .
sunflower , will you come and take a walk with me ?
of course .
you dont wanna be a pilot , you want to impress your father .
come on , vivi , i aint doing this just for him .
theres a war on .
itd be wrong not to go .
itd be wrong to leave me here .
you said ...
im sorry , bebe .
its already done .
besides , i gotta do something right for the old man .
will you come back ?
of course .
swear on the virgin .
i swear .
swear on your mothers life .
i swear .
now i want you to make me a promise .
promise me that when i come home ... ... youll be the one i come home to , you understand ?
what if im away being a big city newspaper woman ... ?
you can do anything you set your mind to .
you know that , dont you ?
im going to miss you .
he made me swear not to till he told you .
you should have warned me .
what did genevieve say ?
she cried and begged him to change his mind .
daddy called her unpatriotic .
he gave a speech and made a toast .
mama swore shed never drink to a son going to war ... ... so now daddys in the doghouse .
amen .
theres not a goddamn breeze in louisiana .
will someone please wring me out ?
we cannot just sit here and puddle .
well have to make our own breeze !
no !
dont you do that !
oh , my god !
do not pull over , teensy .
i mean it !
if you cant talk your way out of this one , then i dont know what !
we are going straight to hell .
yeah , we went to jail .
i was so proud .
your mama was a bad influence .
if not for you , our moral fiber wouldve been shredded to rags .
teensy , smack her for me !
kids , am i gonna have to give you a time out ?
vivi ?
yes ?
you all right ?
im fine .
you need anything ?
no .
all right , then .
i owe all my creativity to her .
if id had an easy childhood , id have nothing to write about .
that is the truth , honey .
why isnt grandma buggys name on this invitation ?
well , that birthday business was ugly .
your granddaddy had just settled a big case ... ... and he wanted to strut his money .
buggy didnt want to have that dance .
she didnt believe in parties .
and sure as hell didnt believe in celebrating your mama .
he did it just to spite her .
taylor abbott treated his horses better than he treated his wife .
and your mama got caught in the crossfire .
boy , did she ever .
daddy , is it real ?
of course its real .
it is ?
i think its the most beautiful thing ive ever seen in my life .
mama , its gorgeous .
did you pick it out ?
mr. abbott , that is not a proper gift for a girl .
thats right .
but its a perfect gift for a young woman .
a beautiful young woman .
arent you just the luckiest little girl god ever made ?
why dont you come with me , bebe ?
hey , good iooking .
this ring doesnt compare to the one ill get you .
everybody saw .
the only thing anybody saw is how beautiful you are .
and were not gonna be like them .
all right ?
i swear , honey .
dont you worry .
dont you worry .
no !
whatever you did to make your father give you this ring is a mortal sin .
may god forgive you .
i didnt do anything !
he just gave it to me .
i didnt do anything !
she is sick .
dont let her get to you .
dont worry .
ill steal it back if i have to .
now do it , buggy !
do it !
give the girl the goddamn ring , you pathetic catholic idiot .
pick it up .
daddy !
you bend down , and you pick up that goddamn ring .
give me your hand .
viviane , i gave this ring to you .
its yours .
its from me to you .
you understand ?
what do you have to say ?
making a fool of yourself in front of vivianes friends ?
you go to sleep , girls .
you okay ?
yeah , but wow .
how horrible to be so hated by your own mother .
mamas jealous , competitive and judgmental , but she doesnt hate me .
not like that .
oh , wait a minute .
yes , she does .
forgot .
shes trying to hate you , honey .
you delivered her a swift kick in the ego .
shes just smarting .
i have dreams about this .
could be chick .
its her .
could be chick , but its her .
dont answer it .
right .
hello ?
caught you .
you think you can get away with this ?
i know what youre up to .
up to ?
whats that supposed to mean ?
you dont fool me .
well ...
were not up to anything .
if we were , it would be none of your business .
dont poke around .
youll spoil things .
i dont want a big fuss , thats all .
i dont want candles on my cake .
itil look like the burning of atlanta .
when we want your advice , well ask for it .
got it ?
big kiss .
she thinks its about her birthday .
can you believe it ?
its coming up real soon too .
couple of days .
no numbers , everybody .
thats one thing mom always did real well , the birthday thing .
in the morning , wed have a party , just us .
when daddy got home , wed do it again .
he could never know about that morning cake , so she always got two .
it was our secret .
im so glad i had you .
im gonna call connor .
you go right ahead .
well leave you alone .
but well be listening from the kitchen , so talk loud .
hi .
how did you know it was me ?
who else ?
how are you feeling ?
a little disoriented .
horse tranquilizers will do that for you .
i cant believe you let them do this .
they didnt ask .
they called on the way , told me their plan .
i saw you off .
from where ?
i helped them get you on the plane .
theyre organized .
they even had a note from a doctor .
your pills are in your bag .
i have a bag ?
in the closet .
tell connor we say hello .
did you hear that ?
ill tell you one thing , meeting them explains a lot about you .
such as ?
let me put it this way .
youre more normal than you have any right to be .
whyd you do that ?
theyil explain it all to you at the betty .
im gonna try and bust out tomorrow .
i gotta get back for work .
dont rush back on my account .
i just said it was for work .
maybe you ought to fix this thing with your mother once and for all .
why are you so worried about this ?
because im afraid that one day our kids may feel that way about you .
these women may be nuts , but they might know something you dont .
its not fair bringing kids we dont have into this .
thats a low blow .
thats the way i feel .
stay there .
deal with it .
you deal with it .
dont new yorkers say goodbye ?
not when theyre on their high horse thinking they know so much .
i hate that .
especially when theyre right .
whenever charlies right , i just ignore him .
yall ignored him , right or wrong .
not really .
like hell we didnt .
took me 25 years to notice my husband was gay .
they just couldnt keep up with us .
i think we created our own world ... ... where we still live happily to this day .
ya ya .
i wonder if mama would have ignored jack like daddy .
no way , pal .
jack was the love of her life .
the kind you only get once .
what happened ?
how did daddy wind up in the hot seat ?
viv .
vivo .
come on , we have to go to teensys house .
no .
come on .
i knowed something bad was coming .
just yesterday , i done heared that screech owl .
you killed my baby !
you killed my baby !
you drink champagne to his death .
you killed him , sure enough , you killed my baby !
i dont think i can take any more .
me neither .
i think i need to go home .
are you all right to drive ?
of course i am .
habit .
see yall tomorrow .
wasnt all just fun and games .
so i see .
shall i make a long story short ?
they never found his body .
not a dog tag , a shoe , nothing .
genevieve got herself believing for a while ... ... that it was all a mistake .
he was still alive , somewhere .
then she stopped believing , and then ... ... the good french lady ... ... took her leave .
i knew i shouldve stopped while i was behind .
poor teens .
your mama rallied for her , but the two of them ... ... neither of them was ever the same .
i wish you could have known what your mother was like as a girl .
you wouldve loved her .
not loving her was never the problem .
her not loving you was never the problem either .
well , what about daddy ?
was she ever in love ?
or was he around for heavy lifting ?
your daddy knew jack .
he said hed rather play second fiddle than not play in the band at all .
he thought he loved her enough for both of them .
maybe he did .
does .
well ... ... i gots some work to do at the woodpile , honey .
lets call it a night , shall we ?
night .
smells good .
now whats wrong , vivi ?
im still not jack ?
shut up , shep .
how long you gonna make us suffer something that cant change ?
fine !
gonna feed your children ?
i dont care if you starve .
hey , kid . ill make dinner , daddy , okay ?
thank you .
ill get the skillet .
dont touch it .
... one : its quiet , two : theres any room for me !
what ?
you go out there and drink yourself to sleep !
you dont lift one finger to help this family !
i dont ?
look at my hands !
i dont want to look at your ugly hands , or you to put them on me !
dont worry !
drunk as you are all the time , i dont want to be in the house .
youre disgusting !
god , i hate you , shep !
i hate you !
is daddy gonna kill her ?
shell kill him first .
hi .
why do you answer like that ?
like what ?
like you know its me .
but it is you .
i thought about what you said .
i know what you mean .
your tone makes me think you dont .
why would my kids feel that way if i wasnt unfit ?
our kids .
lf i wasnt in some way damaged ?
thats what youre saying !
not even close .
theres no logic ?
you simply said it to hurt me ?
youre right .
how can i know ?
so why risk it ?
know what i mean ?
no .
why risk doing to my children and you what mama did to me and daddy ?
ask him about his life while youre at it .
at what ?
figuring out if ill ruin the lives of our hypothetical children .
okay , sidda ?
no shit ?
youre scaring me .
calm down .
do not start that patronizing youre crazy now ... ... so i wont make any sudden moves till youre finishedthing .
see ?
youre doing it !
okay !
uncle !
im painted into a corner where nothing i say could be right .
you want to live painted into a corner by an unfit mother ?
no , no , no !
i never said i wanted that .
ill make this easy .
put this whole thing on hold ... ... while you figure out how badly iii fuck up everybodys life .
do not send those invitations !
siddalee walker ?
you are on the verge of making a big mistake right now .
well , so are you .
only im not gonna let you .
did she just call off our god ... ?
i dont have the number !
i dont have the goddamn number !

sorry , i think she just called off our goddamn life .
i dont have the number !
what are you talking about ?
shes with those friends of yours , the yo yos , or yee haws ...
the ya yas ?
why would she run off with them ?
she didnt run off .
they came here and took her !
oh , for petes sake .
i gotta go .
yes ?
i dont know if you ruined siddas life .
but i do know that now youre ruining mine !
and your phone etiquette sucks !
he hung up on me .
oh , what a surprise !
look what the backstabbing , traitorous cats dragged in !
oh , look who it is !
all my old ex friends !
and the biological fruit of my womb that rotted !
