boxers !
not one step further .
the keeper of the lmperial seal .
just the man i was looking for .
a woman .
you chinese are very progressive .
a gift from an old friend .
wu chow .
he wanted me to send his regards .
father !
father .
the seal .
you must get it back .
i promise .
give this ... to your brother .
what are you reading ?
oh .
roy o' bannon vs. the mummy .
it' s incredible .
roy' s just taken out the mummy' s entire army of zombie confederate soldiers , and he only had one bullet .
that' s impossible .
oh , no , it' s not .
roy figured out the physics of the canyon and then ricocheted a bullet off the canyon wall .
nailed each zombie through the heart .
what about the shanghai kid ?
he was captured and knocked out on page 10 while he was polishing roy' s pearl handles .
don' t you worry .
roy' s about to save him from becoming a human sacrifice .
those stories are all lies .
no .
see ?
it says right here on the back .
author sage mccallister bases all his stories on firsthand accounts .
sorry , sheriff .
no princess .
every day you meet the noon stage .
every day it' s the same story .
she' s not coming back .
pei pei' s married to her work in san francisco .
modern woman .
sheriff , you got a parcel .
hey , maybe it' s from her !
no .
it' s from my sister in china .
i know .
i know .
i must go .
stay here and be a good horsey for the new sheriff .
uh , sheriff , that stage is headed east .
lsn' t china kind of west of here ?
i' m not going to china .
i' m going to new york .
roy invested my money .
ls it true that he lives in a penthouse at the top of the ritz surrounded by dozens of beautiful women at his every beck and call ?
that' s the old roy .
he' s married , settled down .
trust me , he' s changed .
so there we were .
completely outnumbered .
he didn' t have to tell me we didn' t stand a chance .
so i send the shanghai kid and the princess out the back .
poor shanghai kid .
he was so frightened .
he forgot to thank me for saving his life .
i' m used to that .
now , i returned to the front , and i counted to three ... and i burst out of the mission .
pearl handles blazing .
lead flying everywhere .
and not a single bullet touched me .
no !
yeah .
what happened to the emperor' s gold ?
well , we divided it up .
i insisted on giving my share to the lndians .
the savages ?
please don' t ever call those noble people savages .
lf being proud of your body and wanting to ride around naked all day makes you a savage , then , by god , you' re drinking with a savage .
and that is what you call a french toast .
you are so sophisticated , mr. o' bannon .
whoo !
who' s up for some more bubbly ?
reach for the sky , roy .
say that again .
reach for the sky , roy .
chon wang !
you sly son of a gun !
look at you !
look at you !
what brings you to new york ?
my share of the gold .
refresh my memory .
what gold ?
the emperor' s gold .
okay , now , that gold is in what the wall street pros call a long term investment .
we can' t touch it because it' s building .
i need it tonight .
you just got here .
let' s celebrate .
no .
i don' t have time .
you just got to the big city .
my father' s been killed .
chon , i' m ...
you need the money to get back for the funeral ?
no .
i must go to england .
the ship leaves tonight .
your father died in england ?
china .
my sister followed the murderer to london .
wait .
murderer .
i' m a little bit mixed up .
let me see if i can get the facts straight .
you have a sister ?
you never told me you had a sister .
ls she pretty or does she look like you ?
be honest .
roy , i need my money !
i don' t like that tone of voice .
you think after all we' ve been through i' d stiff you ?
i' m doing pretty well for myself .
yeah .
i' m sorry , roy .
that' s okay .
you' re going through a really tough time right now .
you got to be more trusting of people , okay ?
look at me .
it' s roy .
the couple at table 5 is ready to order .
do you work here ?
no , i don' t work here .
it looks like these guys are wearing a similar jacket .
roy , here' s your cut of the tips .
it' s the craziest thing .
i guess because i come in here so much they' re mistaking me for a waiter .
it' s embarrassing .
you lost the gold .
not all of it .
where' s the rest ?
i have one word for you .
zeppelin .
i need my money now !
easy , easy .
will you do anything for this money ?
yes .
i must leave tonight .
okay .
take this key .
go to the room .
get cleaned up .
your old pal roy' s got a plan .
go !
come on !
howdy , big boy .
what ?
there' s a woman in there !
she wants me to sleep with her .
of course she does .
i told her the great wall ain' t the only big thing coming out of china .
why did you say that ?
so you could get the money .
i will not sleep with women for money !
why ?
i' m gonna sleep with her for money .
chon , just go in there and do your business and think about your sister in england .
what ?
roy !
duty calls .
roy !
good evening , mr. mayor .
where are they ?
who ?
my daughters .
10th floor .
roy ?
roy , you got trouble .
roy !
i got to check on something .
i' il be right back .
chon , new plan .
we got to go .
chon , what are you doing ? !
i' m fixing her back .
put her down , you decadent philistine .
hey , chon , come on !
let' s go !
bye bye .
bye .
come on !
i don' t understand .
what' s going on ?
i don' t have time to explain .
all you have to know is there are bad men after us ... but i' m in the right .
roy .
you gotta trust me on this .
okay , look .
i' m in a transitional phase in my life .
but ...
but what ?
you want to know the truth ?
i' m a little lost right now .
i see you .
you' ve got a sense of purpose .
but look at me .
i' m a 30 year old waiter/ gigolo .
where' s the future in that ?
so what' s the plan ?
you were always my compass , chon .
the plan .
you ask me the right questions .
the plan ?
the plan , i think , is to find the right woman .
raise a lot of children and teach them values .
no , roy .
the plan to get out of here .
okay , the plan .
here we go .
cops !
cops !
they can help us .
no , no .
chon , not these cops .
these are dirty cops .
they take advantage of people .
now , if they stop us , remember , i' m not roy o' bannon .
who are you ?
i' m your friend smoky desperado from the west .
and who am l ?
you .
you' re benihana .
benihana .
yeah .
you teach crippled children yoga here in the city .
you go first .
no !
why me ?
because you blend in , okay ?
now , go !
don' t let them see you !
benihana .
hey !
hey !
ooh .
psst !
chon !
come on .
stop wasting time .
you !
chon , i found our ticket out of here .
we' re on our way .
looks like old roy came through again .
just like old times , chon .
check over there !
over to the alley !
that way !
yeah , just like old times .
will you forget about the gold for a second ?
you' re gonna have more money than you ever dreamed of when that first zeppelin takes off .
why do i always believe you ?
what do you mean ?
you' re lucky i didn' t invest in that ridiculous automobile idea .
yeah , that' s gonna make a lot of money .
what' s that ?
doghouse .
i' m in the doghouse .
oh , come on , chon .
look , i' m sorry i lied .
i just didn' t want to disappoint you .
that' s exactly what i mean .
i can' t take that look .
i learned it from my father .
that' s how he used to look at me .
what did your dad do ?
was he an lmperial guard ?
no .
much more important .
he was the keeper of the lmperial seal .
that' s what i love about china .
everybody' s job description sounds so damn cool .
the seal has been symbol of the emperor' s power since genghis khan .
it has been passed down from one emperor to another .
my family have been watching over it for 12 generations .
12 generations ?
my father and i used to skip stones across the moat and talk about a day i would follow his footsteps .
i was his only son .
lf i' d have been there , i could have protected him .
it' s not your fault .
you were 3, 000 miles away .
what' s with that little box ?
my sister sent it to me from my father .
there' s a message inside .
what' s it say ?
it' s a puzzle box .
i don' t know how to open yet .
what do you mean ?
get a hammer and smash it open so you can see what it says .
i must have patience .
by the time i' m able to open it ...
i will be ready to read the message .
come on , confucius .
that' s the corniest thing i' ve ever heard .
let me see this .
you know what ?
we' re gonna go to england .
we' re gonna find your dad' s killer .
we' re gonna get that seal back .
there' s no reward for this , roy .
who said anything about a reward ?
i' m talking about friendship , loyalty , honor .
okay ?
thank you , roy .
and i hear england is ass soup .
a lot of pretty girls there .
first order of business , my lords ... is a report from our esteemed friend lord rathbone ... who recently returned from a diplomatic mission to china .
fellow lords ...
i' m afraid i bring disturbing news from the orient .
the opium wars have ravaged the land .
the emperor' s enemies are organizing .
the most vicious are the boxers .
a godless band of rebels who murder without discretion .
china is not well .
i have brought back an envoy who should give us some insight into the inscrutable mind of the chinese .
ls he mad ?
given to her majesty queen victoria by the emperor in recognition of her 50 glorious years on the throne .
outrageousness !
long live the queen .
# england swings like a pendulum do #
# bobbies on bicycles , two by two #
# westminster abbey , the tower of big ben #
# the rosy red cheeks of the little children #
jack the ripper strikes again !
extra !
extra !
read all about it .
howdy , partner .
the english are not very friendly .
they' re just sore losers .
what did they lose ?
a little thing called the american revolution , chon .
never heard of it .
i' il give you the highlights .
they came over with about a million men .
we had a bunch of farmers with pitchforks and beat ' em like a drum .
hey !
i' m walking here !
you' re driving on the wrong side of the road !
bunch of amateurs .
these people don' t get it .
hello , ladies .
look at you .
what ?
i' m not supposed to notice a pretty lady ?
i thought you wanted to settle down and have a family .
i do , chon .
i just hope i can .
why not ?
sometimes i worry that all the damn horseback riding
i did out in the west , bouncing up and down on the hard saddles might have made it so my salmon don' t swim upstream the way they' re supposed to .
what ?
i might be shooting blanks .
oh .
don' t say anything .
roy , it' s okay .
some people are not meant to have a family .
i' ve always had such a special connection with children .
the little ankle biters .
hey , watch it , you little punk !
pardon me , guv .
you gents lost your way ?
yeah .
we' re looking for my sister .
she' s staying at 32 oxford street .
i know it well , guv .
me old man used to live there .
can you show us the way ?
well , memory' s a little dodgy .
but i' m sure for a bob i could get you there .
what do you take us for ?
okies from muskogee ?
go sell your bullshit someplace else .
we' re not buying .
thanks for the tip , guv .
hey !
i stole that watch from my uncle !
what ?
this way .
come here , you little rubbish eater !
what did i tell you about poaching on our turf , charlie ?
i' m on the straight and narrow .
honest .
what' s this , then ?
after i' m through beating you ... you' re gonna wish you never ran away from the workhouse !
leave the boy alone .
bloody tourists !
get your noses out of it !
do whatever you want to the kid ... but that' s my watch .
well , there' s a load of us and only two of you .
so piss off !
easy , fellas .
you' ve lost one war this way .
don' t make the same mistake twice .
come on !
after him !
hey !
there he is !
get him !
we' ve got him now .
move in , lads .
boys , boys , wait , wait !
come on !
get him !
up the bloody ladder !
hey !
hey !
oh !
watch it !
hey .
ah !
come here , you !
cool .
move it !
you !
did you see that ?
it' s okay .
okay ? !
i call that one my kung pao chicken .
i clotheslined the sucker .
come on , get back !
clear away !
make way !
i think you gentlemen should accompany me back to the yard .
this isn' t a yard !
it' s a jail !
roy , calm down .
unbelievable .
wait !
someone' s coming !
let me handle this .
i' m gonna handle it .
the english aren' t like you .
they don' t get all emotional .
touchy feely .
do me a favor .
park the kung fu .
let me do the talking .
come here .
let me give you a hug .
ooh !
i' ve been after that fleet street gang for two years .
then you two come along and bring them down in a single afternoon .
brilliant !
now , um ...
oh , that' s my watch !
yes .
a street urchin turned it in .
the little punk better not have scuffed it .
i hope your luck picks up .
what do you mean ?
i deduced from your watch that you' d hit a rough patch .
he has .
how do you know ?
it' s an investigative technique i' ve developed .
i can deduce intimate details about an individual through a close scrutiny of their personal effects .
what else can you tell ?
the owner of this watch is a bad gambler and a lousy shot .
although he' s cheated death several times ... he spends most of his life wandering in a rather pathetic and futile search for purpose and respect .
oh , yes .
he has a penchant for loose women .
wow .
that' s amazing .
i' m sure it' s a very popular party trick at birthdays for small children ... but it doesn' t quite play with adults .
just to set the record straight .
roy o' bannon is not attracted to loose women .
loose women are attracted to me .
you' re roy o' bannon ?
yeah .
the famous western folk hero ?
have you heard of me ?
have i heard of you ?
i' ve only read " roy o' bannon vs. the mummy " five times .
it' s fascinating .
i want you to meet the shanghai kid .
oh , yes .
the faithful chinese sidekick .
i' m not a sidekick .
those stories are all lies .
come on , don' t be bitter .
i can' t help what sage mccallister writes .
lf there' s anything i can do , i' m at your service .
we' re looking for my sister .
she' s staying at this address .
can you take us there ?
oh , dear .
i think you' d better come with me .
lin .
wang .
lf you don' t mind , i' il just wait outside .
lntroduce me .
oh .
this is lin , my baby sister .
roy o' bannon .
pleasure .
you never told me your sister was such a ... beautiful lotus blossom .
what' d she say ?
no , no , no .
no talking about me in your native tongue .
why are you in jail ?
i followed the man who murdered father .
and ?
i found out where he live .
i snuck inside his house and tried to kill him .
it' s my duty to find father' s killer .
no , it is mine !
i' m the one who promised father .
but i' m his only son .
when you abandoned us for america ...
father said he had no son .
what ?
whoa .
time out .
time out .
come here .
the detective' s a fan .
why don' t i play the celebrity card ?
we' il get her out that way .
okay ?
okay .
don' t worry .
i' il get you out .
everything' s gonna be okay .
ln fact , i' m gonna give you my good luck playing cards .
just ignore the naked ladies .
wang !
have you opened father' s box ?
not yet .
she tried to assassinate lord rathbone whilst he was taking afternoon tea .
he' s 10th in line to the throne ...
her majesty' s favorite cousin ... and the finest swordsman in england .
so , of course , the press had a field day .
the story actually knocked jack the ripper off the front page .
artie , lin is not a killer .
she' s just a really , really , really hot ... confused chinese girl .
maybe if i agreed to sign a few autographs and talk to some of my fans here in england ... do some type of charity event , can we get her out that way ?
i' m afraid that' s out of the question .
what will happen to my sister ?
she' il go to trial , probably be locked away in an institution for the criminally insane .
the tabloids have already dubbed her " loony lin .
i thought it was rather catchy .
at the time .
do you have any notion what would happen if we were to be seen together ?
since your return , i have yet to lay eyes on the lmperial seal .
i' m hosting a jubilee ball at my country estate tomorrow .
be at the stables at midnight .
as requested , a token of my esteem .
this is where you get out .
i hope there will be more trust between us when i' m emperor and you are the new king .
wow .
buckingham palace .
look at that , chon .
that' s where the queen lives .
hey , look at this guy .
he' s a royal guard .
he has a very important job .
i used to be just like him .
no , they' re nothing like you .
they' re a tourist attraction .
you can make faces at them , insult them ... and they can' t move a muscle .
here .
watch this .
roy ...
no , it' s okay .
hey , buddy , your shoes are untied .
that is the biggest damn beaver i have ever seen .
roy , stop it .
the queen !
look !
the queen !
she' s mooning us !
he almost went for that .
my friend and i just came over from america .
you might have heard of it .
we run your jerkwater country .
come on , you gonna take that from a colonial ?
roy , stop it .
i bet you are one hell of a damn poker player .
no hard feelings .
huh ?
they can' t do that !
you' re not allowed to do that !
shouldn' t have touched him .
you scram , you little punk .
i' ve got friends at scotland yard .
i' il give you up in a heartbeat .
you get your watch back ?
don' t worry about my watch .
go on .
it' s a knockoff .
what are you talking about ?
my uncle stole this watch from president lincoln .
it' s a priceless family heirloom .
not according to the pawnbroker .
you should not steal .
lf i don' t steal , i don' t eat .
who showed you how to do all that kicking and punching ?
my father .
have you ever heard of those ?
they' re parents .
you don' t ' cause you' re a little orphan .
now , go on .
you' re cramping our style .
oh , this country blows .
you need a place to stay ?
come on in and warm your dogs .
you can get into a lot of trouble breaking into a place like this .
that being said , well done .
you just ate the last chocolate .
course i did .
you gotta look out for number one .
i could really get used to this .
living the life of a country gentleman .
maybe doing a little painting .
let lin play in the garden with the children .
vera , chuck , and dave .
who' s lin ?
lin' s the most beautiful woman i' ve ever met .
she' s gonna be the savior of the house of o' bannon .
chon , check out the threads .
all i' m missing is the loyal hound curled at my feet .
we are wasting time .
we must find rathbone .
what do you think i' ve been doing ?
sitting here drinking expensive hooch ?
refill .
i' ve been working on a plan .
now whoa .
don' t slosh the brandy .
it messes with the bouquet .
sod off .
i' m trying to teach you a skill set .
help get you off the street .
bartenders make big bucks .
roy !
the plan .
thank you , chon .
lf we find the seal ... we can prove rathbone killed your dad .
it' s the old hail mary play .
i also have a version where we dig a tunnel .
hey !
bloody catapult .
jesus christ !
you don' t need a catapult !
who asked you ?
you don' t interrupt grown ups when they' re talking .
lord nelson rathbone requests the pleasure of your company at the jubilee ball in honor of her majesty' s 50th year on the throne .
sounds good .
it doesn' t address security .
they' re not gonna let chon and i waltz into the castle .
all you need is a proper disguise .
i do like a good disguise .
i look like a fool .
what ? !
you' re a maharaja .
that' s lndian royalty .
but i' m chinese .
it' s the same thing .
bob your head a little bit .
gives you more of a lndia royalty flavor .
that' s good .
good show , good show .
good show , good show .
cheerio , cheerio .
cheerio , cheerio .
what do we do when we see rathbone ?
kill him .
no , okay ?
no !
you' re gonna be civil , ' cause we don' t have the seal .
no seal .
no lin .
no family honor .
okay ?
be cool .
okay , we look great .
let' s enjoy this party .
whoa .
what are you doing ?
i' m going inside .
the place is haunted .
you' re the harness man .
you get back at the carriage .
you wait in case we need to make a quick getaway .
go on .
man your post .
you don' t always get what you want .
why are you so mean to that boy ?
i see a lot of myself in that kid .
it' s kind of freaking me out .
come on .
your name , please , sir .
so i can announce you .
sherlock ... holmes .
sherlock holmes .
which province do you represent , your highness ?
nevada .
may i present major general sherlock holmes and his highness , the maharaja of nevada .
how are the security arrangements ?
oh , everything seems to be going swimmingly , my lord .
and if i may say so ... it is an honor to guard your lordship tonight .
i speak for all of us at scotland yard when i say that no matter how far you are from the throne ... you' il always be number one in our hearts .
okay , here' s the plan .
we' re gonna get a little chow .
then we' re gonna sneak out of here .
start looking for that seal .
okay .
spotted dick , sir ?
what ?
spotted dick .
can you believe this guy ?
i' m trying to get something to eat .
he' s asking me if i got the clap .
i think he' s offering you food .
oh .
spotted dick .
oh , no .
i think i' il pass .
i' m not really a dessert man .
perhaps my friend might like some spotted dick .
i might try one of these sausages .
a little smoky joe .
mmm !
this is good !
i thought the food here was supposed to suck .
the haggis is fresh from scotland , sir .
it' s made from the finest sheeps ' bladders .
i' m gonna get some whiskey and wash my mouth out .
you should try the quail .
i shot them myself this morning .
how do you do , your lordship ?
very well , thank you .
i' m not acquainted with the nevada province .
but i haven' t been to lndia since ' 81 .
i spent most of my time in the orient .
i hear you' ve just returned from china .
you are well informed , maharaja .
it is my dream that the chinese people will follow lndia' s example and one day embrace british rule .
the chinese are very proud .
they place family and honor above all else .
well , i' m sure we can break them of that .
lf you' il excuse me , i have a matter to attend to .
until we meet again .
patience .
i' m proud of you , chon .
we must find the seal .
what do you see ?
shh , shh , shh !
he just pulled a fancy dragon key out of his desk .
that was my father' s !
i must avenge his honor .
hey , slow down , tiger .
slow down .
quit going all chinese on me .
where is he ?
damn it .
remember your puzzle box .
patience .
okay , there are no windows .
we just came in through the only doorway .
that leaves one explanation .
remember in " roy o' bannon vs. the mummy " how the zombie king got away when i chased him into the pharaoh' s tomb ?
there' s a secret passageway behind the sphinx .
there' s gotta be a lever or a button over here .
help me lift some stuff up .
roy !
the painting .
it' s looking at me .
look !
oh , yeah .
looks like it' s looking at me .
that' s great .
no , real eyes .
moving !
that kid got to you , didn' t he ?
unbelievable !
we' re not in a haunted house .
that' s a technique that an artist uses .
ubiquitous gaze " or " pursuant eyes " is the technical term .
it' s unnerving , though .
i' il give you that .
roy .
now , those eyes .
look !
whatever you say , chon .
let' s see what you got here , rathbone .
roy !
what , chon ?
are the statues moving now ?
wow .
mm mmm !
roy !
i can' t hear myself think with you shouting at me .
chon ?
chon ?
chon ?
this is ridiculous .
lf you want to act like a child and play games ... then find someone else ...
' cause i take this stuff seriously .
i' m here to work .
i' m on a mission .
chon ?
okay , chon .
okay , you little chinese otter .
let' s play .
ha !
chon , demons !
she' s gonna fight my battles for me .
come on .
let' s go .
what ?
what are you doing ?
it' s kinky .
i like it .
wow !
look at this .
wait .
there' s something different about this room .
hey .
