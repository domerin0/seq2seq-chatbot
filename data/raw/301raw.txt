sentinels .
damn it .
we were headed for junction 21 like you ordered .
robbie picked up the signals we' re confirming the hr scans .
we weren' t sure what to do .
the readings don' t make any sense .
they read like sentinels .
but there' s thousands of them .
directly above us .
is that possible ?
we got company .
they don' t look happy to see us .
get us out of here .
we' re cut off !
there' s an intersection .
it' s uncharted .
take it !
get to the gun turrets !
right .
come get some .
hang on .
i' ve never seen the surface .
it' s nothing now but one big graveyard .
oh , my god .
it' s an army .
what is that thing ?
some kind of tunneling machine .
oh , no .
what ?
look where we are .
what' s four kilometers straight down ?
zion .
go .
go .
go !
zion .
zion has to be warned !
how ?
someone had to get to a drop point .
what ?
are you crazy ?
we can' t broadcast now !
we have to .
i' il go .
there isn' t much time .
i' il make it .
you know , i peeked .

goodbye , thadeus .

pardon me .
i' m sorry .
i was in my own little world .

goodbye .
goodbye .
thadeus .
