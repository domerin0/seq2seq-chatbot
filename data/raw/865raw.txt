we think they' re trying to set us up as patsies .
you know how corrupt it is here .
the klan' s here , they' re inbred , they sleep with their sisters .
some of them do .
all right , ma , listen .
we gotta get an attorney , and it' s gonna cost a lot of money .
how much would an attorney cost ?
a decent one ? $50, 000 . $100, 000 .
50, 000 .
100, 000 ...
i know , ma .
i know .
can we use any attorney ?

you stick out like a sore thumb around here .
me ?
what about you ?
i fit in better than you .

oh , yeah .
you blend .
i bet the chinese food here is terrible .
i don' t see anything .
the wheels went out of balance
right after we hit that mud .
no , that' s not it .
i think you should put it on a rack and take a look .
what' s wrong ?
what ?
what' s the problem ?
the car was shimmying on the highway .
you got mud in your tyres .
i got mud in my tyres ?
let me ask you , how do you get mud into the tyres ?
that' s a figure of speech .
the mud gets around the inside of the wheel .
throws the balance off .
did you ever hear that ?
mud in the tyres ?
no .
she never heard it .
she knows everything about cars .
see , down here , everybody gets stuck in the mud every now and then .
yeah .
we' re famous for our mud .
famous for your mud ?
how' s your chinese food ?
you keep on askin ' about that .
can' t you tell they don' t have chinese restaurants ?
gotta let everybody know you' re a tourist .
come on .
and you' re a fuckin ' world traveller ?
our jail was condemned this morning .
that' s why we bringin ' you all out to the state corrections facility .
unlock the gate .
go on through .
do you know what happens in these places ?
yeah , i know what happens .
there' s often a big guy named bubba no one will tangle with .
he' il protect you if you become his sex slave and do whatever he wants .
there' s only the two of us here .
what about those cots ?
what if they put somebody else in here ?
stan .
shut up .
ok .
i can' t believe my luck .
here .
we got somebody for you .
you must be stan .
how you doin ' ?
why' d they bring you in here ?
i just got in .
i asked for the new guys and they brought me here .
he' s sleepin ' , huh ?
cute little guy .
you know , maybe i' il just start with you .
let him sleep a little bit .
look , i don' t wanna do this .
i don' t blame you .
if i was in your situation , i' d wanna get through this whole thing as quickly and with as little pain as possible .
so let' s try our best to make it a simple in and out procedure .
what' s the matter ?
relax , relax .
relax .
maybe we should spend a couple of minutes together .
you know , to get acquainted before we , you know , before we get to it .
what' s wrong with you ?
i don' t wanna do this .
i understand , but what are your alternatives ?
my alternatives ?
to what ?
to you ?
i dunno .
suicide .
death .
look , it' s either me or them .
you' re gettin ' fucked , one way or the other .
lighten up , ok ?
don' t worry , i' m gonna help you .
gee , thanks .
excuse me , but i think a modicum of gratitude would not be outta line here .
you think i should be grateful ?
yeah .
i mean it' s your ass , not mine .
i think you should be grateful .
i think you should be down on your fuckin ' knees .
i didn' t know your visit was such an honour .
i' m doin ' a favour .
you' re gettin ' me for nothin ' , you little fuck .
boy , that' s one hell of an ego you' ve got .
what the fuck is your problem ?
i did not come here just to get jerked off .
no .
no , no .
i' m not jerking you off .
i' m not doing anything .
you' re on your own .
i' m just takin ' care of sleeping beauty .
billy .
back off .
vinny .
hey , vinny .
vinny ?
vinny bag o ' donuts .
how are you ?
this is vinny ?
i don' t know where to start .
have you had any murder cases before ?
none .
this' il be my first .
your first ?
yeah .
what kind of cases have you had ?
assault and battery ?
armed robbery ?
no .
well , i expect he' s done burglary , grand theft auto , drugs .
no .
nothin ' like that either .
what kind ... what kind of law do you practise ?
well , up till now , personal injury .
well , you' re a trial attorney , right ?
i mean , personal injury trials .
well , actually , this' il be my first foray into the trial process .
i haven' t had to go to court yet .
knock on wood .
you haven' t had to go to court yet .
how long you been practising ?
almost six weeks .
but ...
you graduated six years ago .
what have you been doin ' ?
studyin ' , for the bar .
six years ?
that' s a lot of studying .
well , to be honest with you ,
i ...
i didn' t pass my first time out .
that' s ok .
you passed the second time ?
i' m afraid not .
three times a charm ?
not for me it isn' t .
no .
for me , six times was a charm .
six times .
a little informal , aren' t we ?
i was resting ...
not wearing a coat or tie .
sorry .
well , approving an attorney from out of state is a pretty informal matter .
i just have a few questions .
ok .
fire away , judge .
where' d you go to law school ?
brooklyn academy of law .
is that an accredited law school ?
yes .
how long you been practising ?
about six ...
almost sixteen years .
any murder cases ?
quite a few .
yes .
what was the outcome ?
you know .
win some , lose some .
this is not the forum to be cavalier .
of course .
now , let me see .
most recently , i had a axe murder , which i won , on the grounds of temporary insanity .
wanna hear the facts of the case ?
no .
what else ?
let me see .
what else ?
you ever heard of the son of sam ?
the fella who received orders to kill from a dog ?
that one .
you defended him ?
well , no , not exactly .
i defended the first guy they arrested .
and he was found innocent and set free and they caught the real guy .
well .
we don' t have any serial killers in beechum county .
what we do have is as sophisticated a justice system as they do in the rest of the country .
i' m sure .
you being from new york an ' all might have the impression that law is practised with a degree of informality here .
it isn' t .
right .
i tell you this because i want you to know that when it comes to procedure ,
i' m not a patient man .
sir , when you come into my courtroom , you ought to know the letter of the law .
i' il react harshly when you don' t .
you should .
being from new york won' t get you special treatment .
it shouldn' t .
you won' t .
you' il be given no leeway whatsoever .
i expect you to know this information when you come into my courtroom .
right .
you willing to accept those terms ?
right .
no problem .
just this ?
this is gonna be great .
vinny' s first case .
so ?
what can i do to help ?
nothin ' ?
no .
what the fuck is that ?
wanna sit at the counter ?
hey .
how ya doin ' ?
listen , what' s the story with this incredibly , remarkably loud whistle at 5 . 30 in the morning ?
it' s the steam whistle .
over at the sawmill .
tell folks it' s time to get up .
you can hear it for miles .
y' all want somethin ' ?
yeah .
breakfast ?
you think ?
good choice .
two .
excuse me .
you guys down here hear about the ongoing cholesterol problem in the country ?
what' s this over here ?
you never heard of grits ?
sure .
sure , i heard of grits .
i just actually never seen a grit before .
honey , you gonna try it ?
you first .
what is a grit , anyways ?
it' s made out of corn .
them hominy grits .
hominy .
how d' you cook it ?
simmer it in water for 15 or 20 minutes , put it on the plate and add butter .
so ?
you gonna eat it or not ?
here ?
is your attorney here ?
i am the attorney .
jim trotter the third .
district attorney of beechum county .
vincent la guardia gambini .
first .
brooklyn .
nice to see you .
yeah .
vinny .
hey .
all rise for his honour judge chamberlain haller .
the court of beechum county is now in session .
be seated .
first case .
the people of the state of alabama versus william robert gambini and stanley marcus rothenstein ,
" steen . " she called me " stine " .
just ...
counsellor , your clients are charged with first degree murder .
how do they plead ?
your honour , my clients ...
don' t talk to me sitting in that chair .
but he told me to sit here .
when you address this court , you will rise and speak to me in a clear , intelligible voice .
sorry .
my clients ...
what are you wearin ' ?
huh ?
what are you wearin ' ?
i' m wearin ' clothes .
i don' t get the question .
when you come into my court looking like you do , you not only insult me , but you insult the integrity of this court .
i apologise , sir , but this is how i dress .
next time you come into my courtroom , you will look lawyer ly .
i mean , you comb your hair and wear a suit and tie .
and that suit better be made outta some kind of cloth .
you understand me ?
yes .
fine , judge .
fine .
good .
you may continue .
how do your clients plead ?
my clients are caught completely by surprise .
they thought they were getting arrested for shoplifting a can of tuna .
what are you telling me ?
that they plead not guilty ?
no .
i' m just trying to explain .
i don' t wanna hear explanations .
the state of alabama has its procedure .
and that procedure , at this point in time , is to have an arraignment .
are we clear on this ?
yes .
but there seems to be a great deal of confusion here .
mr gambini .
you see , my clients ...
all the way ?
all i ask from you is a very simple answer to a very simple question .
there are only two ways to answer . " guilty " or " not guilty " .
but my clients didn' t do anything .
once again , the communication process has broken down .
it appears to me that you want to skip the arraignment process , go directly to trial , skip that , and get a dismissal .
well , i' m not about to revamp the entire judicial process just because you find yourself in the unique position of defending clients who say they didn' t do it .
now , the next words out of your mouth are either gonna be " guilty " or " not guilty " .
i don' t wanna hear commentary , argument or opinion .
if i hear anything other than " guilty " or " not guilty " , you' il be in contempt .
i don' t even wanna hear you clear your throat .
i hope i' ve been clear .
now , how do your clients plead ?
i think i get the point .
no .
i don' t think you do .
you' re now in contempt of court .
will you go for two counts of contempt ?
not guilty .
thank you .
bail will be set at $200, 000 .
preliminary hearing will be set for 9 . 30am tomorrow morning .
bailiff , please take mr gambini into custody .
his bail will be set at $200 .
come with me , please .
all rise as the judge leaves .
you have to bail me out .
you know that , right ?
let' s go .
they' re gonna nuke this guy norton this weekend .
looks like it .
you got one huge responsibility , taking on this murder case .
you screw up and those boys get fried .
i know .
so you think you know what you' re doin ' ?
yeah , i think i know what i' m doin ' .
you didn' t look like you knew what you were doin ' today in that courtroom .
why is that ?
well , it' s a lot of procedure , that' s all .
i' il learn it as i go .
learn as you go ?
yeah , yeah .
didn' t they teach that in law school ?
no , they didn' t .
they teach you contracts , precedence , interpretations .
then the firm that hires you , they teach you procedures .
or you can go to court and watch .
so why don' t you go to court and watch ?
because , between your father' s garage and working nights , when was i supposed to go ?
i thought this summer i would take off a couple of months .
but it ain' t no big deal .
are you sure ?
yes , i' m sure .
how can you be so sure when you don' t know what it is you' re supposed to know ?
it' s a procedure .
like rebuilding a carburettor has a procedure .
you know how the first thing you do is you take the carburettor off the manifold ?
suppose you skip the first step , and as you' re replacing one of the jets , you drop the jet .
it goes down , rolls along the manifold and into the head .
you' re fucked .
you' ve learned the hard way that you gotta remove the carburettor first .
that' s what happened to me today .
i learned the hard way .
actually , it was a good learning experience for me .
all right .
well , is there any way i could help out in this procedure situation ?
yeah .
keep bailing me out .
we can' t afford to keep bailing you out .
i' ve cashed in half the traveller' s cheques .
i didn' t wanna cash ' em in , but i didn' t wanna bounce a cheque .
i tried hustling the money , but i got stiffed , so i cashed ...
whoa , whoa .
what do you mean , you got stiffed ?
did you say you got stiffed ?
hey .
vincent la guardia gambini .
his name' s jt .
jt .
i believe you and lisa played a game of pool for $200 , which she won .
i' m here to collect .
how about if i just kick your ass ?
a counteroffer ?
that' s what we lawyers i' m a lawyer we lawyers call that a " counteroffer " .
let me see .
this is a tough decision .
get my ass kicked or collect $200 ?
what do you think ?
i could use a good ass kicking , i' il be very honest with you .
nah , i think i' il just go with the 200 .
over my dead body .
you like to renegotiate as you go along , huh ?
ok , then .
here' s my counteroffer .
do i have to kill you ?
what if i was just to kick the everlovin ' shit outta you ?
in your dreams .
no , no , no .
in reality .
if i was to kick the shit outta you , do i get the money ?
if you kicked the shit outta me ?
yeah .
yeah , then you get the money .
what happened ?
rear ended ?
no , i fell .
ok .
let' s see if we agree on the terms .
the choice now is i get my ass kicked or , option b , i kick your ass and collect the 200 .
i' m going with option b.
kicking your ass and collecting $200 .
are we gonna fight now ?
yeah .
first , let me see the money .
i have the money .
all right .
let me see it .
show it to me .
i can get it .
you can get it ?
all right .
get it .
and then we' il fight .
you fell in your place or somebody else' s ?
my place .
shit .
he blew the arraignment .
it' s a simple procedure .
you heard the judge .
all he had to do was say " guilty " or " not guilty " .
so ?
what are you saying ?
what am i saying ?
you saw what happened in there .
you wanna stay with him after that ?
shit , stan .
i don' t wanna fire him .
he' s family .
and my mother , the way her health is right now ...
i appreciate that .
but should you die for that ?
wouldn' t your mother be more upset if you die ?
the thing is , given the chance , i think he could do a good job .
no , you' re wrong .
come on , fellas , knock it off .
let' s go .
stan , listen .
you have to see the gambinis in action .
these people , they love to argue .
i mean , they live to argue .
my parents argue , too that doesn' t make them lawyers .
stan , i' ve seen your parents argue .
trust me , they' re amateurs .
is that a drip i hear ?
yeah .
weren' t you the last one to use the bathroom ?
so ?
did you use the faucet ?
yeah .
then why didn' t you turn it off ?
i did turn it off .
well , if you turned it off , why am i listening to it ?
did it occur to you it could be turned off and drip at the same time ?
no .
if you turned it off , it wouldn' t drip .
maybe it' s broken .
is that what you' re saying ?
it' s broken ?
yeah , that' s it .
it' s broken .
you sure ?
i' m positive .
maybe you didn' t twist it hard enough ?
i twisted it just right .
how could you be so sure ?
if you will look in the manual , you will see that this particular model faucet requires a range of 10 to 16 foot pounds of torque .
i routinely twist to maximum allowable torquage .
how could you be sure you used 16 foot pounds of torque ?
because i used a craftsman model 1019 laboratory edition
signature series torque wrench .
the kind used by caltech high energy physicists and nasa engineers .
well , in that case , how could you be sure that' s accurate ?
because a split second before the torque wrench was applied to the faucet handle , it had been calibrated by top members of the state and federal department of weights and measures to be dead on balls accurate .
here' s a certificate of validation .
dead on balls accurate ?
it' s an industry term .
i guess the fucking thing is broken .
we gotta move .
then i heard two loud bangs , like firecrackers .
i looked up and saw two young men run out from the sac o suds and jump into a green car with a white convertible top , and drive off like the dickens .
miss riley , are those two young men present in the courtroom ?
yes , sir .
they are .
could you point ' em out for me , please ?
they sittin ' right there .
now , mrs riley , is this the car ?
yes , sir .
it is .
thank you , ma' am .
let the records show mrs constance riley identified the defendants ' car .
i was makin ' my breakfast .
i saw them two boys go into the store .
then later i heard a gunshot .
looked out the window .
they were running out .
got into the car and drove off .
is this the car ?
yes .
it is .
thank you , sir .
then you saw those two boys run out o ' the sac o suds , jump in this car and take off ?
yeah .
they peeled away .
car was all over the road .
thank you , sir .
i asked him if he did it , and he said " i shot the clerk .
i asked him again , and again he said " i shot the clerk .
your honour , no further questions .
mr gambini .
yes .
do you have anything to add ?
thing ?
what thing ?
not for me to say .
no , sir .
you can stand down .
do you have any other witnesses ?
no , your honour .
the court finds sufficient evidence exists for this matter to go to trial .
i' m setting this matter for trial this monday , february 2 , 10am .
mr gambini .
stand up .
now , didn' t i tell you next time you appear in my courtroom that you dress appropriately ?
you were serious about that ?
why didn' t you ask them any questions ?
questions ?
ask who questions ?
you knew you could ask questions .
didn' t you , vin ?
if you' d put up a fight , you could have gotten the case thrown out .
hey , stan .
you' re in ala fuckin ' bama .
you come from new york .
you killed a good old boy .
there is no way this is not going to trial .
what the fuck is goin ' on here , vinny ?
you fuckin ' up this case or what ?
i told you .
it' s just procedure .
i' m bound to fuck up a little .
a little ?
you got thrown in jail .
twice .
i know i was in jail .
i don' t need you to point it out to me , ok ?
you' re my fiancee .
you' re supposed to stand by your man .
you know , encourage me a little bit .
a little encouragement .
is that what you want ?
i' m sorry .
you were wonderful in there .
the way you handled that judge ...
you' re a smooth talker .
you are .
all right , knock it off .
knock it off .
do you think i like fuckin ' up ?
is that it ?
you raggin ' on me is not gonna give me any great spontaneous knowledge .
yeah ?
so shut it .
you done readin ' ?
yeah .
do you wanna go to bed ?
i don' t know .
i don' t feel good .
you shouldn' t feel good .
you haven' t slept much in three days .
that' s part of it .
you know what it is ?
i' m ...
i' m really scared .
you should be .
how the fuck did i get into this shit ?
sure .
no problem .
i could win the case .
i already got myself sent to jail twice .
i could win this thing , though .
i know i could .
if i could keep my ass awake and outta jail long enough , betcha i could , huh ?
you know what i think ?
honestly ?
i think that once you' re out there and you' re doin ' your thing ,
i think you' re gonna be really great .
really great .
if you don' t fuck up .
if this was a conspiracy , they' d have to get all those people to lie .
do you think that' s what' s happening ?
look , i think we should meet with the public defender .
see what he' s like .
if he' s honest , then we should go with him .
all right .
that' s death row in there .
it is ?
the chair ain' t working like it used to .
the guy we fried last week took us three attempts and his head caught fire .
see , there' s no money in the budget to get it looked at .
i say it' d be cheaper to get it fixed than keeping running up them extra electric bills .
hi , stanley .
my name is john gibbons and i' m an attorney in the public defender' s office .
hi , john .
hey .
now , the evidence against you is pretty strong , so why don' t you just tell me your side of the story ?
hey , vin .
hey , billy .
how are ya ?
how do you feel ?
ok ?
all right .
where' s stan ?
stan , he' s not comin ' .
he' s ...
well , he wants to go with the public defender .
listen , vin ...
i' m going with the public defender , too .
i' m sorry .
i' m sorry , i just didn' t know what little experience you have with this .
what , are you scared ?
yeah , i' m scared .
maybe i could have handled the preliminary a little better .
but what' s most important is winning the case .
i could do it .
i really could .
let me tell you how , ok ?
the da' s gotta build a case .
building a case is like building a house .
each piece of evidence is a building block .
he wants to make a brick bunker of a building .
he wants to use serious , solid looking bricks , like these , right ?
right .
let me show you something .
he' s gonna show you the bricks .
he' il show you they got straight sides .
he' il show you how they got the right shape .
he' il show them to you in a very special way so that they appear to have everything a brick should have .
but there' s one thing he' s not gonna show you .
when you look at the bricks at the right angle , they' re as thin as this playing card .
his whole case is an illusion , a magic trick .
it has to be an illusion , cos you' re innocent .
nobody , i mean nobody , pulls the wool over the eyes of a gambini .
especially this one .
give me the chance .
one chance .
let me question the first witness .
lf , after that point , you don' t think that i' m the best man for the job , fire me then and there .
i' il leave quietly .
no grudges .
all i ask is for that one chance .
i think you should give it to me .
you should give it to him ?
what was he before he was a lawyer ?
a fuckin ' comedian ?
if he doesn' t ask the right questions , your lawyer will .
no , he can still fuck things up .
cross examination is about knowing what to say and what not to say .
let' s say he asks all the possible questions , and the witness has all the answers .
he ends up proving the prosecution' s case .
how did he ever talk you into it ?
at my cousin ruthie' s wedding , the groom' s brother was that guy ali kazam .
you know who i' m talkin ' about ?
the magician with the ponytail ?
right .
he did his act , and every time he made something disappear , vinny jumped on him .
he nailed him .
it was like " it' s in his pocket " or " he' s palming it .
or " there' s a mirror under the table .
he was like " wait .
it' s joined in the middle and there' s a spring around it .
it pops it open when it' s inside the tube .
it was like ali kazam' s worst nightmare .
but he was just being vinny .
he was just being the quintessential gambini .
there goes the quintessential norton .
lookee here , jt .
hey , hey , little yankee boy .
look here what i got .
what is it ? $200 .
bring it here .
let me see it .
how do i know that' s not a bunch of ones with a 20 wrapped around it ?
it' s 200 bucks .
fan it out .
show it to me .
yeah , right .
does that freight train come through at 5am every morning ?
no , sir .
it' s very unusual .
ok .
i was making a lot of money , winning most of my cases .
thank you , shirley .
but my clients were guilty as hell .
finally , after getting this fella off some serious charges for the fourth time ,
i tell you the truth , my conscience got to me .
i' d be serving justice more by putting the guilty in jail .
that' s what i' ve been doing and i' m a happier man for it .
how about you ?
well , i got a bullshit traffic ticket .
in court , i got the cop on the stand and argued with him until he admitted he was wrong .
and the judge , this judge malloy , all the while , he' s laughing and smiling , and then , afterwards , he asked me to go to lunch with him .
then he says to me " you know what ?
you' d be a good litigator .
i don' t know what the hell he was talking about .
i don' t know what a litigator is .
i never thought of becoming a lawyer .
but judge malloy was from brooklyn , too .
i mean , he did it .
so all of a sudden it seemed possible .
so i went to law school .
then from time to time , he would come by , see how i was doin ' , if i needed anything .
he was a nice man .
i mean , to go out of his way like that for me , you know ?
he wanted his son to follow in his footsteps , but he became a musician or something .
i remember when i graduated , he was so proud of me .
that' s quite a story .
yeah .
we got some case ahead of us here , huh ?
oh , yeah .
how do you feel about it ?
well , i ...
i' d like to have a murder weapon .
but , other than that , i feel pretty good .
you do ?
oh , yeah .
what you doin ' this afternoon ?
you' re goin ' hunting ?
that' s right .
why are you goin ' hunting ?
shouldn' t you be preparing for court ?
i was thinkin ' last night " lf only i knew what he knows . " you know ?
if he' d let me look at his files .
oh , boy .
i don' t get it .
what does getting to trotter' s files have to do with hunting ?
well , you know .
two guys out in the woods , guns , on the hunt .
it' s a bonding thing , you know .
show him i' m one of the boys .
he won' t let me see his files , but maybe he' il relax enough to drop his guard so that i can finesse a little information out of him .
what am i gonna wear ?
what are you gonna hunt ?
i don' t know .
he' s got a lot of stuffed heads in his office .
heads ?
what kind of heads ?
i don' t know .
he' s got a boar , a bear , a couple of deer .
whoa .
you' re gonna shoot a deer ?
i don' t know .
i suppose .
i mean , i' m a man' s man .
i could go deer hunting .
a sweet , innocent , harmless , leaf eating , doe eyed little deer .
hey , lisa .
i' m not gonna go out there just to wimp out , you know ?
i mean , the guy' il lose respect for me .
would you rather have that ?
what about these pants i got on ?
you think they' re ok ?
lmagine you' re a deer .
you' re prancing along .
you get thirsty .
you spot a little brook .
you put your little deer lips down to the cool , clear water .
bam .
a fuckin ' bullet rips off part of your head .
your brains are layin ' on the ground in little bloody pieces .
would you give a fuck what kind of pants the son of a bitch who shot you was wearing ?
i' d sure like to get a look at your files .
you would ?
sure .
you got a xerox machine over there ?
no .
that' s ok .
i' il have my secretary do it .
shirley , can you xerox all the files on the gambini/ rothenstein case for mr gambini ?
yeah .
thanks , sweetheart .
what' s all that ?
trotter' s files .
all of ' em .
you stole his files ?
i didn' t steal his files .
listen to this .
i' m just ready to finesse him .
i' m starting to finesse him .
i got him goin ' .
he offers to have his secretary copy everything for me .
that' s very impressive finessing .
that' s not all .
he' s letting us use his hunting cabin when he gets back .
it' s in the woods .
it' s quiet .
he sleeps like a baby when he' s there .
terrific .
you' re a helluva bonder .
what' s this ?
are you reading this book ?
yeah .
do me a favour , ok ?
don' t read this book .
ok ?
thank you very much .
all right .
don' t you wanna know why trotter gave you his files ?
i told you why already .
he has to by law .
you' re entitled .
it' s called disclosure , you dickhead .
he has to show you everything , otherwise it could be a mistrial .
he has to give you a list of all his witnesses .
you can talk to all his witnesses .
he' s not allowed any surprises .
they didn' t teach you that in law school either ?
now let me ask you this .
how many levels of thickness have you gone through ?
what' d you have for breakfast ?
well ...
what' s that brown stuff ?
yesterday you told me that freight train hardly ever comes through here at 5am .
i know .
she' s supposed to come through at ten after four .
can you participate in this in which the final decision may be death by electrocution ?
ma' am ?
i think it should be left up to the victims ' families , rather than the courts .
the defendants in this case are charged with robbing a convenience store .
and then , in a most cowardly fashion , shooting the clerk in the back .
now , if sufficient evidence is offered to prove these facts , you think you could ...
fry ' em .
she' il do .
mr gambini .
come in .
come in .
i just got a fax from the new york state office of judicial records .
they have no records of any vincent gambini ever trying any case in the entire state of new york .
you' re not gonna find any records of vincent la guardia gambini practising in any courts .
i just told you that .
you don' t understand .
see , 20 years ago , i became a actor .
there was this prominent stage actor in new york .
his name was vincent gambini .
maybe you heard of him .
no .
never heard of him ?
doesn' t matter .
anyway , i had to change my name , which i did legally .
so now i practise law under my legally changed stage name .
what name is that ?
jerry ga ...
jerry gallo .
you can still call me gambini .
sorry .
what name did you tell him ?
jerry gallo .
jerry gallo ?
the big attorney ?
yeah .
think that was a smart move ?
yeah .
he' s a seriously accomplished lawyer .
his name' il show up all over the place .
his name was in the papers all last week .
i saw that .
you didn' t actually read the articles ?
no .
that' s too bad .
why is that ?
cos he' s dead .
what' s the matter with you ?
i dunno .
you' re acting like you' re nervous .
well , yeah .
i am .
why ?
i' m the one that' s under the gun .
the trial starts tomorrow .
you wanna know what i' m nervous about ?
i' il tell you .
i am in the dark here with this legal crap .
i have no idea what' s goin ' on .
all' s i know is you' re screwin ' up and i can' t help .
you lent me your little camera , didn' t ya ?
oh , vinny .
i' m watchin ' you go down in flames , bringin ' me with you , and i can' t do anything about it .
and ?
i hate to bring it up i know you got enough pressure on you but we agreed to get married when you won your first case .
meanwhile , ten years later , my niece , the daughter of my sister , is gettin ' married .
my biological clock is tickin ' like this , and the way this case is goin ' , i ain' t never gettin ' married .
lisa , i don' t need this .
i swear to god , i do not need this right now , ok ?
i got a judge that' s just aching to throw me in jail .
an idiot who wants to fight me for $200 .
slaughtered pigs .
giant loud whistles .
i ain' t slept in five days .
i got no money .
a dress code problem .
and a little murder case which , in the balance , holds the lives of two innocent kids .
not to mention your biological clock , my career , your life , our marriage , and let me see , what else can we pile on ?
is there any more shit we can pile on to the top of the outcome of this case ?
is it possible ?
maybe it was a bad time to bring it up .
what the fuck is that ?
this is very romantic .
out here in this field , under the stars , quiet .
no one around for miles .
it' s very romantic .
i don' t see no stars .
honey , move .
my back .
i have to get up .
wait .
let me ...
this fuckin ' jacket .
fuck .
you ok ?
what was in that plastic thing in the trunk ?
it' s your suit .
what is my suit doing in the trunk ?
i had it cleaned .
i thought it' d be a nice surprise go in there with a clean suit .
i have 30 fuckin ' minutes to take a shower , get a new suit and get to the courthouse .
you fuckin ' shower , i' il get your fuckin ' suit .
little yankee wuss .
look here .
got your $200 .
you gonna kick the shit out of me now ?
mr gambini , are you mockin ' me with that outfit ?
mockin ' you ?
i' m not mockin ' you , judge .
then explain that outfit .
i bought a suit .
you seen it .
now it' s covered in mud .
this town doesn' t have a one hour cleaners , so i had to buy a new suit .
except that the only store you could buy a new suit in has got the flu .
you get that ?
the whole store got the flu .
so i had to get this in a second hand store .
so , it' s either wear the leather jacket which i know you hate or this .
so i wore this ridiculous thing for you .
are you on drugs ?
drugs ?
no .
i don' t take drugs .
i don' t like your attitude .
what else is new ?
i' m holding you in contempt of court .
there' s a fuckin ' surprise .
what' d you say ?
what ?
what' d you just say ?
what' d i say ?
what ?
your honour , counsel , members of the jury .
the evidence in this case is gonna show that at 9 . 30 in the morning of january 4th , both defendants , stanley rothenstein and william gambini , were seen gettin ' out of their metallic green 1964 buick skylark convertible with a white top .
it' s gonna show they were seen entering the sac o suds convenience store in wazoo city .
the evidence is gonna show that , minutes after they entered the sac o suds , a gunshot was heard by three eyewitnesses .
you will then hear the testimony of the three eyewitnesses who saw the defendants runnin ' out of the sac o suds just after the shots were heard , gettin ' into their faded metallic green 1964 buick skylark and drivin ' off in great haste .
finally , the state is gonna prove that the defendants , gambini and rothenstein , admitted then recanted their testimony to the sheriff of beechum county .
now let' s get down to it .
your verdict is gonna depend on what you think of the sworn testimony .
not what i think .
what i think don' t count .
you' re the jury .
it' s your job to decide who' s tellin ' the truth .
truth .
that' s what " verdict " means .
it' s a word that comes down from ol ' england , and all our little ol ' ancestors .
now , we' re gonna be asking you to return a verdict of murder in the first degree for william gambini and a verdict of accessory to murder in the first degree for stanley rothenstein , for helping gambini commit this heinous crime .
counsellor , you wish to make an opening statement ?
counsellor ?
vinny .
what ?
come on , it' s time to make your opening statement .
come on , vin .
everything that guy said is bullshit .
thank you .
objection , your honour .
counsel' s entire opening statement is argument .
objection sustained .
the entire opening statement , with the exception of " thank you " , will be stricken from the record .
the jury will please disregard counsel' s entire opening statement .
and you , mr gambini , will not use that kinda language in my court .
understand ?
yeah , yeah , yeah .
putz .
counsellor .
your statement , sir .
well , now .
ladies and gentlemen of the j j j ... of of the j j j ... jury .
on on ...
on january ffffffff .... fourth of this year , my client did indeed visit the sac o suds c ... co ...
convenience store .
but but he didn' t kill anyone .
he ...
we intend to prove that the ppppp ... prosecution' s case is circumstantial and and and
coincidental .
thank you .
that' s it ?
what about everything we talked about ?
i get a little nervous ...
a little ?
i' m gettin ' better .
i heard a gunshot , so i looked out the window and i seen them two boys run out , get into their car , and drive off like maniacs , their tyres screechin ' , smokin ' , goin ' up on the kerb .
is this the car ?
yes , sir .
thank you , sir .
no further questions , your honour .
your witness .
all right .
mr t t t ...
tipton .
now , when you viewed my clients ,
how how far away were you ?
about 50 feet .
now , do you think that that' s close enough to make an accurate i i i identification ?
yes .
mr tipton , i see you wear eyeglasses .
sometimes .
would you care to show those eyeglasses to the jury , please ?
thank you .
thank you .
mr tipton , were you wearing them that day ?
no .
you see .
you were 50 feet away , you made a positive eyewitness identification , and and and yet you were not wearing your necessary prescription eyeglasses .
they' re reading glasses .
well , mr ...
could you tell the court what colour eyes the defendants have ?
brown .
hazel green .
no more questions .
mr gambini .
your witness .
he' s a tough one .
yes .
mr tipton .
when you viewed the defendants walkin ' from their car into the sac o suds , what angle was your point of view ?
they was kind of walking toward me when they entered the store .
and when they left , what angle was your point of view ?
they was kind of walkin ' away from me .
so would you say you got a better shot of them goin ' in , and not so much comin ' out ?
you could say that .
i did say that .
would you say that ?
yeah .
is it possible the two youths ...
two what ?
what was that word ?
what word ?
two what ?
what ?
did you say " yoots " ?
yeah .
two youths .
what is a yoot ?
excuse me , your honour .
two youths .
is it possible the two defendants entered the store , picked 22 specific items off of the shelves , had the clerk take money , make change , then leave .
then , two different men drive up in a similar ...
don' t shake your head .
wait till you hear the whole thing so you can understand .
two different men drive up in a similar looking car , go in , shoot the clerk , rob him and then leave ?
no .
they didn' t have enough time .
how much time was they in the store ?
five minutes .
five minutes ?
did you look at your watch ?
no .
oh , i' m sorry .
you testified earlier that the boys went into the store and you had just begun to make breakfast .
you were just ready to eat and you heard a gunshot .
so obviously it takes you five minutes to make breakfast , so you knew that .
do you remember what you had ?
eggs and grits .
eggs and grits .
i like grits , too .
how do you cook your grits ?
you like ' em regular , creamy or al dente ?
just regular , i guess .
regular . lnstant grits ?
no self respectin ' southerner uses instant grits .
i take pride in my grits .
so , mr tipton .
how could it take you five minutes to cook your grits when it takes the entire grit eating world 20 minutes ?
i dunno .
i' m a fast cook , i guess .
i' m sorry , i was over here .
i couldn' t hear .
did you say you' re a fast cook ?
that' s it ?
are we to believe that boiling water soaks into a grit faster in your kitchen than on any place on the face of the earth ?
i don' t know .
perhaps the laws of physics cease to exist on your stove .
were these magic grits ?
did you buy them from the same guy who sold jack his beanstalk beans ?
objection , your honour .
sustained .
are you sure about that five minutes ?
i don' t know .
i think you made your point .
are you sure about that five minutes ?
i may have been mistaken .
i got no more use for this guy .
you' re fired .
i want him .
come on , now .
move it .
don' t worry .
i' il bail you out .
don' t .
i' m gonna stay in prison tonight .
maybe i can finally get some sleep .
i' m doin ' good , huh ?
hey , how ya doin ' ?
hey , mr crane .
what are these pictures of ?
my house and stuff .
house and stuff .
and what is this brown stuff on the windows ?
dirt .
dirt .
what is this rusty , dusty , dirty lookin ' thing over your window ?
it' s a screen .
a screen .
it' s a screen .
what are these really big things right in the middle of your view from the window of your kitchen to the sac o suds ?
what do we call these big things ?
trees ?
trees , that' s right .
don' t be afraid .
just shout ' em out when you know .
now , what are these thousands of little things that are on trees ?
leaves .
leaves .
and these bushy things between the trees ?
bushes .
bushes .
so , mr crane .
you could positively identify the defendants for a moment of two seconds
looking through this dirty window , this crud covered screen , these trees with all these leaves on them , and i don' t know how many bushes .
looks like five .
don' t forget this one and this one .
seven bushes .
seven bushes .
so , what do you think ?
is it possible you just saw two guys in a green convertible , and not necessarily these two particular guys ?
i suppose .
i' m finished with this guy .
mrs riley , when you saw the defendants , were you wearing your glasses ?
yes , i was .
over here , dear .
would you mind puttin ' your glasses on for us , please ?
whoa .
how long you been wearin ' glasses ?
since i was six .
have they always been that thick ?
oh , no .
they got thicker over the years .
so as your eyes have gotten more and more outta whack as you' ve gotten older , how many different levels of thickness have you gone through ?
i don' t know .
over sixty years , maybe ten times .
maybe you' re ready for a thicker set .
oh , no .
no , i think they ok .
maybe we should make sure .
let' s check it out .
now , how far were the defendants from you when you saw them entering the sac o suds ?
about 100 feet .
100 feet .
would you hold this , please ?
thank you .
sorry .
excuse me .
sorry .
sorry .
ok .
this is 50 feet .
that' s half the distance .
how many fingers am i holding up ?
let the records show that counsel is holding up two fingers .
your honour , please , huh ?
sorry .
now , mrs riley , and only mrs riley , how many fingers am i holding up now ?
four .
what do you think now , dear ?
i' m thinkin ' of gettin ' thicker glasses .
thank you .
hello .
you did good out there today , yankee .
i like the competition .
you like competition , too ?
makes things kinda fun , doesn' t it ?
i' m enjoying myself so far .
i got a little surprise for you tomorrow .
what' s that ?
you know you have to disclose all your evidence to me .
i just got it myself .
i' il disclose it first thing in the morning .
judge gonna have to admit it .
should i be worried ?
i sure would be if i were you .
honey , where did you read about all that disclosure shit ?
let me show you .
why ?
i' m a special automotive instructor of forensic studies for the fbl .
how long you been in that position ?
18 years .
your honour .
may we approach the bench , please ?
if you wish .
i object to this witness being called at this time .
we' ve been given no prior notice he' d testify , no discovery of any tests he' s conducted , and the defence is entitled to advance notice of any witness who will testify , particularly those giving scientific evidence , so we can prepare for cross examination , and to give the defence an opportunity to have reports reviewed by a defence expert who might then be in a position to contradict the veracity of his conclusions .
mr gambini .
yes , sir .
that is a lucid , intelligent , well thought out objection .
thank you , your honour .
overruled .
now , mr wilbur .
these are photos of tyres belonging to the defendants ' car .
and these are photos of the tyre marks left by the assailants ' car as it fled the store .
now , are you familiar with these ?
yes , i am .
could you elaborate , please , sir ?
we compared the tyre marks outside the convenience store with the rear tyres of the defendants ' car .
they' re the same model and size tyre .
michelin model xgv , size 75r , 14 inch wheel .
they' re the same size and model tyre .
anything else , sir ?
yes , indeed .
the car , leaving the convenience store , spun its rear tyres dramatically and left a residue of rubber on the asphalt .
now , i took a sample of that rubber and analysed it .
i also took a sample of the rubber from the rear tyres of the defendants ' buick and analysed that , too .
what kind of equipment did you use to find this out ?
i used a hewlett packard 57 10a dual column gas chromatograph with flame analysation detectors .
is that thing turbocharged ?
only on the floor models .
now , mr wilbur .
what was the result of your analysis ?
the chemical composition between the two samples was found to be identical .
ldentical .
no further questions , your honour .
your honour .
thank you , mr wilbur .
court' il take a 60 minute recess for lunch .
your honour , i respectfully request a full day' s continuance to go over this sh ... stuff .
request denied .
thanks a lot .
and , mr gambini .

you' re a dead man .
i' m a dead man ?

yes , i did .

he said he found out that gallo is dead .
he found out .

i' m sorry .

" can i help ?
no , you can' t help .
i wish you could , but you can' t .
ok , you' re lookin ' at me .

is it possible that two separate cars could be driving on michelin model xgv 75r 14s ?
of course .
let me ask you this .
what' s the best selling single model tyre being sold in the united states today ?
the michelin xgv .
and what' s the most popular size ?
75r 14 .
the same size as on the defendants ' car .
but two faded green 1964 buick skylark convertibles ?
excuse me .
what i' m askin ' you is if the most popular size of the most popular tyre is on the defendants ' car ?
well , yeah .
yes .
thank you .
no further questions .
the witness can stand down .
counsel .
yeah .
prosecution rests .
mr gambini .

this person is not on the witness list .
this witness is a automobile expert and is being called to rebut the testimony of george wilbur .
your honour , would you instruct the bailiff to escort miss vito to the witness stand ?
hold up your right hand .
do you swear to tell the truth ,
the whole truth , and nothing but the truth ?
yeah .
miss vito .
you' re supposed to be some kinda expert in automobiles .
is that correct ?
is that correct ?
will you please answer the counsel ?
no .
i hate him .
your honour , may i treat miss vito as a hostile witness ?
you think i' m hostile now , wait till you see me tonight .
do you two know each other ?
yeah , she' s my fiancee .
well , that would certainly explain the hostility .
i object to this witness . lmproper foundation .
i' m not aware of this person' s qualifications .
i' d like to voir dire this witness as to the extent of her expertise .
granted .
mr trotter , you may proceed .
miss vito , what' s your current profession ?
i' m an out of work hairdresser .
out of work hairdresser .
now , in what way does that qualify you as an expert in automobiles ?
it doesn' t .
well , in what way are you qualified ?
well , my father was a mechanic .
his father was a mechanic .
my mother' s father was a mechanic .
my three brothers are mechanics .
four uncles on my father' s side ...
miss vito , your family' s obviously qualified .
but , have you ever worked as a mechanic ?
yeah .
in my father' s garage , yeah .
as a mechanic ?
what' d you do in your father' s garage ?
tune ups , oil changes , brake relining , engine rebuilds , rebuilds on trannies ...
ok .
ok .
but does being an ex mechanic qualify you as being expert on tyre marks ?
no .
thank you .
goodbye .
sit down and stay there until you' re told to leave .
your honour .
miss vito' s expertise is in general automotive knowledge .
it is in this area that her testimony will be applicable .
now , if mr trotter wishes to voir dire the witness as to the extent of her expertise in this area ,
i' m sure he' s gonna be more than satisfied .
ok .
all right .
all right .
now , miss vito .
being an expert on general automotive knowledge , can you tell me what would the correct ignition timing be on a 1955 bel air chevrolet , with a 327 cubic inch engine , and a four barrel carburettor ?
that' s a bullshit question .
does that mean that you can' t answer it ?
it' s impossible to answer .
because you don' t know the answer .
nobody could answer that question .
your honour , i move to disqualify miss vito as a expert witness .
can you answer the question ?
no .
it is a trick question .
why is it a trick question ?
watch this .
cos chevy didn' t make a 327 in ' 55 .
the 327 didn' t come out till ' 62 .
and it wasn' t offered in the bel air with a four barrel carb till ' 64 .
however , in 1964 the correct ignition timing would be four degrees before top , dead centre .
well ...
she' s acceptable , your honour .
your honour , this is a picture taken by my fiancee outside the sac o suds .
can we agree on this ?
yeah .
thank you .
i' d like to submit this picture of the tyre tracks as evidence .
mr trotter .
no objection , your honour .
miss vito .
did you take this picture ?
you know i did .
and what is this picture of ?
you know what it' s of .
miss vito , it has been argued by me , the defence , that two sets of guys met up at the sac o suds , at the same time , driving identical metallic mint green 1964 buick skylark convertibles .
now , can you tell us , by what you see in this picture , if the defence' s case holds water ?
miss vito .
please answer the question .
does the defence' s case hold water ?
no .
the defence is wrong .
are you sure ?
i' m positive .
how could you be so sure ?
because there is no way that these tyre marks were made by a ' 64 buick skylark .
these marks were made by a 1963 pontiac tempest .
objection .
can we clarify whether the witness is stating opinion or fact ?
this is your opinion ?
it' s a fact .
i find it hard to believe that this kind of information could be ascertained simply by looking at a picture .
would you like me to explain ?
i would love to hear this .
so would l .
the car that made these two equal length tyre marks had positraction .
can' t make those marks without positraction , which was not available on the ' 64 skylark .
and why not ?
what is positraction ?
it' s a limited slip differential which distributes power equally to both the right and left tyres .
the ' 64 skylark had a regular differential which , anyone who' s been stuck in the mud knows , you step on the gas , one tyre spins , the other does nothin ' .
that' s right .
is that it ?
no .
there' s more .
when the left tyre mark goes up on the kerb and the right tyre stays flat and even ...
well , the ' 64 skylark had a solid rear axle , so , when the left tyre goes up on the kerb , the right tyre tilts and rides along its edge .
but that didn' t happen here .
the tyre mark stayed flat and even .
this car had an independent rear suspension .
now , in the ' 60s there were only two other cars made in america that had positraction and independent rear suspension , and enough power to make these marks .
one was the corvette , which could never be confused with the buick skylark .
the other had the same body length , height , width , weight , wheel base and wheel track as the ' 64 skylark , and that was the 1963 pontiac tempest .
and because both cars were made by gm , were both cars available in metallic mint green paint ?
they were .
thank you , miss vito .
no more questions .
thank you very , very much .
you' ve been a lovely , lovely witness .
mr trotter , would you like to question miss vito ?
mr trotter .
no .
no , your honour .
no further questions .
in that case , your honour , i' d like to recall george wilbur .
miss vito , you can stand down .
you realise you' re still under oath .
yes , your honour .
mr wilbur , how' d you like miss vito' s testimony ?
very impressive .
she' s cute too , huh ?
yes , very .
mr gambini .
sorry , your honour .
mr wilbur , in your expert opinion , would you say that everything miss vito said on the stand was 100 % accurate ?
i' d have to say that .
and is there any way in the world the buick that the defendants were driving made those tyre tracks ?
come on .
you can say .
it' s ok , they know .
actually ,
no .
no .
thank you .
no more questions .
your honour , i call sheriff farley .
you may stand down now , mr wilbur .
sheriff , you realise you' re still under oath ?
yes , sir .
sheriff farley .
what' d you find out ?
on a hunch ,
i took it upon myself to check if there was any information on a ' 63 pontiac tempest stolen or abandoned recently .
this computer read out confirms that two boys , who fit the defendants ' description , were arrested two days ago by sheriff tilman in jasper county , georgia , for driving a stolen metallic mint green 1963 pontiac tempest with a white convertible top , michelin model xgv tyres , size 75r 14 .
is that it ?
no .
a. 357 magnum revolver was found in their possession .
sheriff farley , just to refresh the court' s memory , what calibre bullet was used to murder jimmy willis ?
a. 357 magnum .
the defence rests .
mr trotter .
your honour , in light of miss vito' s and mr wilbur' s testimony , the state' d like to dismiss all charges .
order in the court .
order here .
i have to get out of here by three .
make sure all the bags are in the car .
vinny , i' m sorry to have ever doubted you at any time , and for this i apologise .
under the circumstances ...
you were great .
i just want to say thank you .
you' re welcome .
i hope we can do it again .
fine job , mr gambini .
thanks .
y' all come back and see us any time now .
i' il see .
vin .
bill .
you' re welcome .
vin , i ....
listen .
take your time , pick the right words , get back to new york , gimme a call .
vinny , you did a terrific job .
thanks .
you got an open invitation any time you come here .
we can get us a deer next time .
ok .
thanks a lot .
i feel like if i don' t get outta here now , i might never be able to leave .
mr gambini .
i have a fax here from the clerk of new york .
i owe you an apology , sir .
i' m honoured to shake your hand .
win some , lose some .
your courtroom manner may be rather unconventional , but i gotta tell you , you' re one helluva trial lawyer .
thank you .
and you' re one helluva judge .
sorry .
bye , now .
what the hell was that all about back there ?
i had a friend send a fax to the judge , confirming the very impressive legal stature of jerry callo .
what friends you got in the clerk' s office ?
your friend .
my friend ?
judge malloy .
so what' s your problem ?
my problem is i wanted to win my first case without any help from anybody .
well , i guess that plan' s moot .
yeah .
this could be a sign of things to come .
you win all your cases , but with somebody else' s help , right ?
you win case after case , and then afterwards , you have to go up to somebody and you have to say " thank you .
oh , my god .
what a fuckin ' nightmare .
i won my first case .
you know what this means .
yeah .
you think i' m gonna marry you .
you' re not gonna marry me now ?
no way .
you can' t win a case by yourself .
you' re fuckin ' useless .
i thought we' d get married this weekend .
you don' t get it , do you ?
that is not romantic .
i want a wedding in church with bridesmaids and flowers .
how many times did you say that spontaneous is romantic ?
hey , a burp is spontaneous .
a burp is not romantic .
