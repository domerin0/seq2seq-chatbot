**
the first hazard for the returning hero ... is his fame .
the adulation can spin you quite giddy .
those who once dismissed you as a lousy pork chop ... now clamor just to be in your presence .
sir !
sir !
look , sir , look !
look !
up in the sky !
look up there !
excuse me .
mr. hoggett .
mr. hoggett , sir .
mr. hoggett , sir .
your pig .
lf you' d just hold the pig up for the press .
look this way !
this way !
one more !
show us the pig !
the deeds of the farmer and his remarkable pig ... became renowned even in distant lands .
... find the time to apply for all these ...
lnvitations came from all over to open fairs ,
to demonstrate sheepherding ...
oh !
more ?
and , indeed , to meet a queen .
ooh .
but arthur hoggett was a retiring man .
he found his best pleasures working his farm .
i' il need a neighbor to help me .
so it was , one morning he set out to repair the water pump ... and babe somehow got it into his head that he could help .
but fate turns on a moment , dear ones , and the pig was about to learn the meaning of those two cruel words of regret : " if only .
lf only he hadn' t been so careless ; w whoa !
if only the weight of the pig and the pump did not exceed the weight of the farmer ; if only the farmer did not connect with the platform on the way up ... or jam his fingers at the top ; if only the pump hadn' t fallen off at the bottom ; and if only the poor farmer had the presence of mind ... to hold onto the rope .
boss ?
boss !
at no other time in his short life ... had the pig wished more that his words could be understood by humans , if only to say , " sorry , boss .
sorry , boss .
* non , rien de rien *
* non je ne regrette rien *
* ni le bien *
* qu' on m' a fait *
* ni le mal *
* tout ca m' est bien egal * * non , rien de rien **
even before her arthur' s misfortune ,
mrs. hoggett was ceaselessly busy ... bustling , baking , bottling and pickling , but now , having to nurse her husband and pay the bills , she found life considerably more challenging ... than she had ever anticipated .
before long , two men showed up .
two men in suits .
men with pale faces and soulless eyes .
such men could have come from only one place : the bank .
arthur !
arthur !
where is it ?
where is it ?
where is it ?
yes .
dear mr. arthur hoggett ... " ... guest appearance for your pig .
... sheepherding demonstration .
sheepherding demonstration ?

babe , the boss is about to lose the farm .
we' il all be sent away .
there' s no telling where we' il end up .
not every human is as kind as ours .
but what can i do ?

you' re a sheep pig .
a champion , no less .

can you come with me , fly ?
i wish i could , dear , but it' s you they want .
please ?
stop it , now .
you' re a brave pig .
and , babe , more often than not in this uncertain world , fortune favors the brave .
porridge in the morning .
no sugar .
a little bit of salt , but not too much .
tea .
no milk , just lemon .
okay , i think that' s everything .
right .
i' m off .
esme ?
don' t worry , arthur .
i won' t let anything happen to your pig .
arthur .
and so , dear ones , the pig and the farmer' s wife ... ventured into the larger world .
what follows is an account of their calamitous adventures ... and how a kind and steady heart ... can mend a sorry world .
save the farm , babe !
save the farm !
save the f a a a a a rm !

ohh ohh whoa !
u um um
uh , uh , excuse me .
excuse me , but i was wondering  hey , look , pal , i' m busy .
uh , well , i seem to have lost my human .
hey , hey , i' m workin ' here .
capisce ?
comprende ?
whoa .
ain' t you a weird lookin ' puppy .
i' m not a puppy .
i' m a sheep pig .
my human' s gone , and i' m hungry , and i' m supposed to save the farm .
yeah , that' s truly tragic , but you see that long line of stuff over there ?
and all those piles yonder ?
you see ' em ?
yes .
well , i gotta sniff every doggone one of ' em .
i' m a sniffer , ya see .
a fully qualified , triple certificated sniffer .
oh .
it' s all in the hooter , the schnozz , the olfactory instrument .
you could be a sniffer with a schnozz like that .
that' s very kind of you , but
don' t interrupt me now .
i' m just gettin ' to the good part .
when you sniff the right smell , do ya know what happens ?
mm mmm .
you jump up and down and go berserk .
that' s what happens .
you should see the humans come runnin ' .
they do ?
why ?
beats me , but it' s sure important .
i get big rewards .
rewards ?
sure .
my heart' s desire .
watch this .
security guard , to the floor !
security guard , come to the floor !
we got one .
she could be my mother .
creepy , isn' t it ?
esme cordelia hoggett ?
oh .
thank heaven .
my pig hasn' t come through , and i' ve only got 15 minutes to make flight ff 115 .
i' ve got to get to the other terminal , but there' s no point me going without the blessed pig .
ma' am , we have the pig .
oh .
let' s get a wriggle on , then .
oh . lf we miss ff 115 , then we won' t make the 4 : 15 shuttle .
and if we don' t make the 4 : 15 shuttle , we won' t make it in time for the fair .
it' s the grandaddy of all state fairs , they say , and today' s the very last day .
it' il all be over and we won' t get the appearance money , and if we don' t get the money the bank won' t take , " sorry , i missed my flight " for an answer .
that' il be it .
all over .
arrivederci , farm .
poor arthur would be utterly ... devastated .
esme cordelia hoggett , we have reason to believe you may be carrying illegal substances on your person .
being an officer of the drug enforcement agency ,
i am authorized by law to conduct certain ... procedures .
please step into the cubicle and remove your clothes .
pardon ?
of course , it was proved beyond any doubt ... that esme cordelia hoggett was not a felon .
but , sadly , they had missed their all important connection , and to make matters worse ... they were obliged to wait some days for the next flight home .
they couldn' t go forward , and they couldn' t go back .
they were stranded .
a and so , you don' t take pets .
but he' s just a little pig .
well , it' s more of a dog , really .
but it' s practically human !
**
**
**
uh huh ?
scram , lady .
this is not a farm .
excuse me .
flealands hotel , a few blocks south .
you' il be welcome there .
esme hoggett studied the face of the stranger ...
thank you . and wondered what could have provoked his unexpected act of kindness .
* when the moon hits your eye *
* like a big pizza pie *
* that' s amore *
* when the world seems to shine *
* like you' ve had too much wine *
* that' s amore *
* bells will ring , ting a ling a ling ting a ling a ling *
* and you sing vita bella *

oh .
i need a room for myself ... and , uh , the , uh , wee pig .
huh ?

what makes you think we take animals ?
oh , but l
what kind of establishment do you think this is ?
well , it isn' t .
am i aware of the city codes and regulations ?
yes .
am i one to break the law ?
absolutely not .
i am very lawful .
are you hearing impaired ?

psst !
psst !
mmm ?
how long did you want to stay ?
i , uh two days .

uh well , i thought you
that was just for the neighbors .
heartless meanies .
where do they expect these poor creatures to go ?
ls he house trained ?
oh , yes .
just like you and me .
do we provide meals ?
no .
but is there a convenience store ?
yes .
two blocks south .
and what is the golden rule ?
never answer the front door .
why ?
it might be an inspector .
mind that step .
what happens if you need anything ?
you knock on this door on the left .
who lives there ?
i do .
where' s the bathroom ?
end of the landing .
do we provide towels ?
what is that , a canine ?
huh ?
you canine ?
little puppy dog ?
flealick , come back .
we don' t know where it' s been .
do we , alan ?
no , nigel .
feline .
you' re a cat ?
do i look like a cat ?
how do i know ?
i got the myopia .
i can barely see .
lf you' re a cat , you gotta scat .
hey !
kitty !
you got no business being on this floor !
you got that ?
no felines on this floor .
period !
where' s the pay phone ?
ln the foyer .
local calls only .
and where does the little piggy stay at all times ?
ln the room .
** * meow , meow , meow , meow meow , meow , meow *
and where does the dear little fella do his necessaries ?
ln the kitty litter .
who empties it ?
you do .
any questions ?
oh .
where do i make a long distance phone call ?
oh , uh , two blocks south .
mm hmm .
oh .
stay , pig .
stay .
babe looked out across this vast habitat , abundant with humans and other creatures , and wondered when he would see his first sheep .
maybe it wasn' t sheepherding .
maybe something else was required of him .
whatever the case , in this place with its dark corners and endless possibilities , the pig felt sure he would find a way to redeem himself .
aww .
can uh , can i help you ?
what are you doing ?
i beg your pardon ?
h hey .
uh , w wait a minute .
but
uh , that belongs to the boss' s wife .
hey , that come back !
uh , hey !
wait up !
oh oh oh oh oh , yeah !
whoa .
lf you' re not a cat , stay and chat .
sorry .
we don' t get out much on account of nig and al and their nerves .
they' re a little nervous .
me , on account of the hips .
well , don' t be a stranger .
it was
open up , please .
o open this door !
you got a problem , sweetie ?
uh l  who is it , honey ?
it' s , uh , kind of a baldy , pinky , whitey thingy .
show ' im in .
announcer , lndistinct )
i' d like the bag back , please .
hey , pinkness , look at the little guy .
you wanna break his heart ?
but it doesn' t belong to him .
tug comes in with the bag , just doin ' his job , collectin ' stuff , and you barge in here " accusicating " and making " demandments .
i didn' t see you with the bag .
who' s to say it belongs to you ?
i' m not leaving without the bag .
i don' t think my big brother , bob bobalooba , the big banana , is " mis splaining " how things work around here .
i may be small , but i can be ferocious if provoked .
and what have we here ?
well , uh , we' re in a negotiation ... with this naked , pink individual .
he' s of foreign extraction , your honor .
possibly even an alien .
you drooling imbeciles .
this is an omnivorous mammal of the order ungulata , an inconsequential species with no other purpose ... than to be eaten by humans .
this lowly , handless , deeply unattractive mud lover ... is a pig .
oh .
for your information ,
i' m a sheep pig , and i' ve been sent to save the farm .
come to think of it , i should be saving the farm right now .
a and if you can' t say anything nice , don' t say anything at all .
so , will this little pink " lunchness " ... fulfill his destiny , nourishmentally speaking ?
we shall see .
i feel very uncomfortable with this conversation .
i want my bag back .
get out of my way !
uncle fugly !
uncle fugly !
uncle fugly !
huh ?
please let me out .
uncle fugly !
there' s been a theft upstairs .
can you imagine ?
esme hoggett , fugly floom .
uncle fugly , esme hoggett .
perhaps we should call the police .
no , no .
no police .
no authorities .
it would be the end of this place .
surely you understand .
oh , dear .
i just phoned my arthur to tell him that at least his pig was safe .
now , on top of everything else  hey !
that' s my human !
remember , we have found your clothes .
i don' t care about clothes .
but the pig i can' t go home without the pig .
did you get that ?
approximately five minutes ago something that looked like a pig exited this establishment .
where did he go ?
left on canal street , and then in the direction of the beach .
okay .
thank you .
* meow * **
* meow , meow * **  what' s that ?
it' s beautiful .
oh , it' s lovely .
* meow , meow * **  ohh !
* they all ran after the farmer' s wife *
* she cut off their tails with a carving knife *
* did you ever see such a sight in your life *
* as three blind mice **
**

give it here !
aaaaah !
whoa !
ohh !
oh , dear .
ohh !
**
show business may not be as honorable a profession as sheepherding , but the pig was willing to endure the ridicule ... if it would help put things right back at hoggett hollow .
and the animals had told him if all went well ... there would be big rewards .
uh , h hey , so , when do i get paid ?
shh !
**
sir , i gotta get going now .
how do i collect my reward ?
i told you , stay under the table !
yep .
okay , uh uh
* non , rien de rien *
* non , je ne regrette rien *
* ni le bien *
* qu' on m' a fait *
* ni le mal *
* tout ca m' est bien egal *
* non , rien de rien *

* c' est paye *
* balaye **
**  take your hands off me !
oh oh ohh !
it' s a mistake !
i' m a grandmother !
somebody help , please !
call farmer hoggett !
okay , freak show' s over !
finished !
come on !
help !
help !
just tell me .
there is no reward , is there ?
was there ever such a thing ?
oh , little pink thingy , this is the city .
as bob always says what do you say , bob ?
it' s all illusory it' s ill , and it' s for losers .
naw , that wasn' t it .
you know , that stuff about no yesterday and no tomorrow .
all you got is this actual " now ness .
the past is gone , and as for the future
yeah .
no guarantees , my little pork pie .
it' s a dog eat dog world and there' s not enough dog to go around .
so you look after number whatsy .
get my drift ?
i' m not a pork pie .
whatever you say , cutie pie .
i' m not any kind of pie .
i' m just a pig on a mission .
**
it' s tough if you' re a pig alone in the city .
it can leave you empty .
and whom do you turn to ?
where was the boss' s wife ?
he thought it might help if he could recall fly and rex and their steadfast words , and he tried really hard , but he could barely remember the face of his beloved boss .
the farm was fading .
it had become just a comforting dream , an echo .
**
* ls your heart filled with pain *
* shall i come back again *
* tell me , dear *
* are you lonesome *
* tonight *
* whoo ooh hoo hoo whoo oooh **
huh ?
are we okay , thelonius ?
thelonius ?
i couldn' t wake him .
i tried .
but he wouldn' t wake up .
he' il be back .
himself always comes back .
thelonius ?
easy , let him be .
let' s see .
mm hmm .
whoa , whoa , wait a minute .
uh , this looks good .
yeah , just drop me off , uh yeah , right here' il be fine .
uh , thanks for the ride , pal .
i just hope you get that operation for your wing .
yeah , right , uh huh .
i mean , not being able to fly long distances , on top of the amount of family tragedies you' ve suffered
oh , my gosh !
yeah , yeah .

hmm huh ?
h hey !

whoa !
pig .

by nightfall , all babe' s concerns ,  all the troubled voices in his head were drowned out by one insistent moan .
food .
the fact is , babe' s belly was making such a fuss ... he began to believe it was talking to him .
food !
huh ?
anybody got any food ?
anybody ?
hey , dogs , you got any edibles , any nibbly dibblies ?
we got a carpet here with some nice spaghetti stains .
but we can' t keep licking the carpet , can we , alan ?

okey dokey .

hmph !
aah !
i' m gonna catch me !
i' m gonna catch me !
aaah !
whoa ohh !
something broke through the terror flickerings , fragments of his short life , the random events that delivered him to this , his moment of annihilation .
as terror gave way to exhaustion ,
why ?
aaah !
this is what happens , alan , on the outside .
it' s the times , nigel .
honey , come away .
please , someone , give us a hand !
please !
kind sir ?
kind sir ?
can you help me ?
i have been cruelly cast out and have nowhere to go .
oh , b but how ?

i know you' re different from the others .
those that have had their way with me make their empty promises , but they are all lies lies .
but , uh  i' m cold .
and i' m afraid and terribly , terribly tired .
where' s your human ?
my humans belong to someone else now .
someone younger and prettier .
i , uh , l i never , ever had a h h human .
i' m hungry .
my human tied me in a bag and throwed me in the water .
my tummy hurts .
try not to think about it .
take pity on us .
we are the excluded and have nowhere to go .
well , uh , it is nice and warm inside .
not a good idea .
oh , but they
no .
no .
no ness .
uh , could that be food ?
oh , have mercy .
quiet .
quiet !
you' il bring all manner of trouble .
uh , perhaps if we all went inside and we all line up ,
i' m sure there' il be enough to go around .
you' re talkin ' as if you' re the word around here .
i' d say he is .
whatever the pig says goes .
anyone hostile to the notion ?
no !
no , no !
no problem !
whatever the pig says , yeah !
anybody else ?
fine by moi .
anybody else else ?
it' s still just a pig .
well , fluff my fur .
this recalls the glory days ... when i was dizzy with privilege .
i had my hair styled and my nails manicured each and every day .
freeloaders .
riffraff with no manners .
they' il soil willy nilly , won' t they , alan ?
willy nilly , nigel .
hey .
swine .
i want you to have this collar .
um ... that' s not necessary .
yes , it is .
uh , you' re very kind , but
no , no , i' m anything but kind .
ln fact , i have a professional obligation to be malicious .
then you should change jobs .
i can' t .
yes , you can .
no , no , it' s in the bloodline .
we were once warriors .
now there' s just the urge .
a murderous shadow lies hard across my soul .
so ...
should i have let you drown ?
most would have .
pig , if you were to wear my collar , it would honor me .
yeah .
thank the pig .
thank you , pig .

hey !

listen  hey !
the chief has somethin ' to say .
um , well , uh , maybe cats and dogs ... could , um , you know , be nicer to each other .
right .
it is decreed that all cats and dogs ... put aside their instinctive and fanatical abhorrence of each other ... and that all creatures , great and diminutive , shall be of equal stature , with rights to liberty and justice ...
* that nobody can deny *
and so say all of us .
i' m still hungry .

and so , dear ones , this topsy turvy night ... was to end with a beginning .
this event , that weaves a thread from past to future , soothed the tired hearts of those assembled ... and , for a while at least , they put aside their uncertainties .

well done !
congratulations , mom .

ferdinand the duck , witness to insanity .
" chaos ...
revisited . " re revisited .
oops .
sorry .
sometimes we discover our talents only through necessity .
babe , who never used his nose for anything but the piggish pursuit of food , soon found he could make his way through the trickiest of smellscapes .
as the morning wore on , he became quite the virtuoso .
it' s close .
it' s close .
we' re getting close .
yes , it' s this way .
hmph !
tourists .
i do believe we' re here .
dr. collins , please report to
ohh .

i knew it .
they' re all dead .
they' re not dead .
well , let' s go get ' em .
flealick , if we get caught , we won' t be able to help anybody .
oh , yes , i' ve given myself a good , hard talking to , let me tell you .
i said to myself , esme , you have let arthur , yourself and the pig down .
the judge had never heard anyone speak so many words in so short a time .
evidently , this was a woman ... of clear conscience and good intent .
i used to dismiss pigs , but then a pig became my husband' s best friend .
besides , he grew up on a farm and had a fondness for pigs .
you can bind me in chains , but the minute i' m free i shall march back into those streets ... and search for my arthur' s pig !
case dismissed !
hello ?
hello ?
it' s the pinkness !

sorry .
uh , sorry .
i' il go lock up .
all right .
okay , okay .
you all know the term " survival of the fastest .
well , i' ve got an idea .
we split into two groups .
the fast ones come with me .
the slow ones stay behind and sacrifice themselves .
ferdinand !
that way we don' t all die .
i think that' s only reasonable , don' t you ?
wh where' s thelonius ?
what are you doing ?
i , l i' m not dressed .

thank the pig .
pig , you get here now ! **
you can' t always put things back together as they were , but you can look to something afresh .
at least , that' s what the two ladies decided .
so it was , the hotel was rented out .
and this provided for a curious arrangement .
i just can' t stand it anymore !
roger !
roger !
**
the money from the hotel ... allowed the hoggetts to keep the farm from the bank .
race you home , alan .
you betcha , nigel .
and so it was , the pig brought the two worlds together .
two broken halves to make something afresh ... in a place just a little to the left of the 20th century .
**
the chimpanzees left show business behind ... and were able to be chimpanzees .
as you would expect , the air agreed with them immeasurably .
although the others got a taste for country life ,
flealick found the pace too slow ... and took to chasing trucks .
* are you lonesome tonight * sad to say ,
**  the thing between the pit bull and pink poodle didn' t last .
she ran off with another dog and left him with the kids .
kids , you got to be scary .
you' re warriors .
give me your snarl .
but , dad , do we have to ?
we don' t want to .
**
* when i kissed you *
* and called you sweetheart *
* do the chairs in your parlor *
* seem empty and bare *
**  as for the orangutan , he insisted on staying at the farmhouse ... with herself .
* and picture me there *
* ls your heart filled with pain *
* shall i come back again *
* tell me , dear *
* are you lonesome *
* tonight **
and finally , dear ones , the pig and the farmer ... were content again in each other' s company .
and things were back to where they started , more or less .
hmm .
that' il do , pig .
that' il do .
* a kind and steady heart *
* can make a gray sky blue *
* and a task that seems impossible *
* ls quite possible for you *
* a kind and steady heart *
* ls sure to see you through *
* it may not seem like very much right now *
* but it' il do , it' il do *
* when you find yourself in the middle of a storm *
* and you' re tired and cold and wet *
* and you' re looking for a place that' s cozy and warm *
* you' il make it if you never forget *
* a kind and steady heart *
* can conquer doubt and fear *
* a little courage goes a long , long way *
* gets you little bit further down the road each day *
* and before you know it you' il hear someone say *
* that' il do , babe *
* that' il do *
* a kind and steady heart *
* ls sure to see you through *
* a little courage goes a long , long way *
* gets you little bit further down the road each day *
* and before you know it you' il hear someone say *
* that' il do *
* that' il do *
* that' il do , babe *
* that' il do **
thank you for staying till the end .
bye bye .
