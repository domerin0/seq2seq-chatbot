the past everything that went before , is a dry leaf fallen from a dead tree .
the tree' s been cut down , the leaf crushed by feet and ground into earth .
so now there is only the memory of trees .
i am the disease that rots the bark of trees .
i am rust and gravity .
in my dreams we are all together again and my mom is happy .
but then the leaves all fall off the trees and my dad is gone .
i call out to him , but wherever he is he can' t hear me .
mr clark , please .
this is ap english .
if you can' t extend a modicum of respect to your classmates , you are free to go right on down the hall to auto shop .
sorry .
thank you .
miss denning , how do you feel about that piece of writing ?
anyone else ?
praise , criticism for miss denning' s poem ?
it' s very nice .
good work .
anyone interested in vying for the discovery award for young poets , we will be discussing the details today after school in poets ' circle , room 302 .
and , just in case the $3, 000 scholarship doesn' t entice you , the finals are held in florida over spring break .
journals in the box .
miss denning ...
you can go deeper .
you' re not staying ?
i have to take care of my sister .
do you want me to pick up an application for you ?
they' re not gonna pick me .
auster' s judging the finals .
what did he say to you ?
nothin ' .
a man in mexico burst his own eardrums with a pencil and sewed his eyelids shut .
he says because the government is deaf and blind to people' s pain .
lily , shut up .
look .
stop it !
you' d better stay in there you little brat !
where' s lily ?
megan ...
i didn' t do anything .
lily ?
open the door .
what' s it gonna take ?
huh ?
get ready for bed .
it wasn' t my fault .
i expect you to take care of her when i' m gone .
get a baby sitter .
i can' t afford a baby sitter .
you do have a responsibility to this family .
you had her .
you take care of her .
what did you say ?
get out of my sight .
it' s gonna get infected .
you' ve gotta stop hurting yourself , lily .
mr blazek .
mr blazek .
channelling bukowski very good .
mr cappo .
i believe " blow job " is two words .
or maybe it' s a hyphen .
miss denning .
mr sadler .
another adventure story .
crap !
want a ride ?
no , it' s ok .
come on .
so are you starting to look for colleges ?
oh , i think i' m just gonna stay here and go to sinclair .
well , there are scholarships , you know .
i mean , in addition to the contest .
well , i just got a job , so i' m kind of busy .
have your parents ever read your work ?
my mom has school after her work so she' s kind of busy , and i don' t really see my dad .
ever ?
birthdays and christmas and ...
he and my mom don' t really get along so it' s kind of ... kind of easier that way .
easier for you ?
we' re the building up on the ... on the right .
i' d like you to enter the poetry contest .
i can give you my lunch hour a few days a week to help you prepare .
but i' m not a poet .
not yet .
you miss the bus ?
you see me on it ?
no .
draw your own conclusions .
where' d you get those ?
did you take them from the storage space ?
draw your own conclusions .
put ' em away before mom comes home .
who' s this ?
dad .
no , the baby .
i wasn' t an angel .
it' s not me .
you have his face .
same chubby cheeks , same eyes ...
you look just like him .
lily , get up .
lily , you' d better be ready to leave in two minutes .
why are you all dressed up ?
do you have your lunch ?
no .
i don' t want it .
why are you wearing mom' s shirt ?
why are you such a pest ?
that' s his house .
auster' s ?
yep .
he won some big award for writing a long time ago .
you know that leather book he carries around ?
it' s his novel .
how would you know ?
my parents used to be friends with him .
if he told you to enter the contest , you' re in .
sorry .
oh , no , please , don' t be .
please .
great poets touch the hidden nerve .
so , we need a map of your nerve centres .
if you' re going to reveal them in your work you need to know where they are .
that' s for later .
what was " the memory of trees " about ?
you said " i am rust and gravity .
what does that mean ?
that i felt bad .
was there a particular time when you felt bad , or you just felt bad in general ?
i don' t know .
all right .
what was the poem about ?
my dad leaving .
so what happened when your dad left ?
was it day or night ?
night .
did he say goodbye to you when he left ?
miss denning , i want you to write about that day .
in detail .
write about the weather , write about what you were wearing , what you were thinking .
be specific .
a whole world emerges from little details .
for example , when we buried my son i' d forgotten to put in my contact lenses and i stood over him right before they closed the coffin trying to fix him in my memory .
i could see the red from his sweater and his blue pants , and there was a scab on his forehead that hadn' t healed from a bicycle accident and i could feel that scab when i kissed him , but when i looked at him it was ... well , it was out of focus .
so , when your dad left what were you doing ?
i don' t remember .
forget that i' m here .
ok ?
i' m not here .
now , just close your eyes .
where are you standing ?
by my window in my room .
did your dad leave in a van , or a taxi , or ... ?
a car .
a car .
what colour was the car ?
blue .
ok .
go on .
you' re on a voyage across an uncharted sea .
you must believe that there is land beyond the horizon .
what land remains as a question mark , but that is the mystery the joy of discovery ...
he doesn' t write that stuff to me .
maybe he' il ask you to the prom .
shut up .
meg , mom wants to talk to you .
hi .
she won' t .
she' s on a hunger strike .
well , i can' t make her .
hello ?
i thought your class was only till nine .
whatever .
meg ?
ok .
you tell me .
i don' t know .
why not ?
what' s funny ?
nothing .
well , why did you laugh ?
i don' t know .
are you afraid i' m gonna tell you that your work stinks ?
does it ?
what do you think ?
probably .
i don' t know .
come back when you do .
it doesn' t stink .
there' s a line that i like .
which one ?
lost leaves spin past the glass , but the trees don' t go , they stay by my window .
what about the rest of it ?
i could go deeper .
good for you .
so , meg , how are things going over at seymour and cedar ?
fine .
did they say they were happy with her ?
well , steve hasn' t called .
well , i guess that' s good .
you don' t have school tomorrow do you , mom ?
no , honey , my interview is tomorrow .
why ?
well , i just have this thing , this writing contest , where we' re gonna read our stuff .
what time ?
after school .
i don' t know if i' il be able to make it .
i don' t know when i' il be done .
i didn' t call to confirm .
it' s all right .
i talked to him this afternoon .
oh .
well , did he say who else he was considering ?
somebody in plastics .
a man or a woman ?
diane , stop .
then you' il have to take the bus to mrs rand' s tomorrow , ok ?
maybe when i get this job we can all go out and celebrate , huh ?
the four of us .
have you sent don a thank you note ?
no .
well , please do that .
he didn' t have to help you get that job .
i' d like to read your story .
it' s not a story .
i thought you said ...
it' s a poem .
well , i would like to read it .
georgia in the contest too ?
yeah .
well , maybe her mom can drop you off at mrs rand' s .
i don' t wanna go there , mom .
her house stinks .
don' t start .
don went to a lot of trouble to get me this interview , and if i get that job it' il be a lot more money for all of us , so don' t be a pill .
wish me luck .
good luck .
good girl .
this is called " blue car " .
i rode my bike past our old house .
a rusty chair keeps your place on the lawn .
lily cuts holes in herself to hurt you but you just won' t bleed .
now she won' t eat .
since you left mom doesn' t say your name .
but even gone , i remember your face
the way the sun stays bright when i shut my eyes ,
the way a torch whipping the dark leaves a long red scar .
some nights when i wake up i forget where we are .
from our apartment , i can' t see the stars or the horizon , only the road .
i know it goes to wherever you are .
miss denning , do you have a second ?
sure .
losing a contest doesn' t mean you lack talent , any more than ... than winning one makes you ezra pound .
do you understand that ?
all of your life you' il be judged .
some people will love you some will say you stink .
none of it matters .
the opinions of these judges your friends , your mother , me .
what matters is the condition of your soul .
that it remain intact .
and that you stay strong and you keep doing the work no matter what .
i will .
no matter what .
i will .
i have to go .
so , congratulations .
i won ?
yes , you did .
so now we have to talk about how to get you to the finals .
florida ?
are you gonna be there ?
yeah , i' il be there .
ok ?
ms pound , you can ... you can go .
i would actually be reporting directly to don , though frank would be my boss .
so when do you hear ?
could be as soon as monday .
i know you' ve been picking up the slack lately .
how does a sperm get into the egg to fertilise it ?
i have some books at home .
i' ve read those books .
if the sperm is in the man' s penis and then the egg is in the woman' s uretus , how do they come together ?
did i give you permission to borrow my blouse ?
so how does the egg enter the uretus ?
do we have to have another talk with father allwart ?
no , thank you .
then keep your hands off of things that don' t belong to you .
how does the egg enter the uretus ?
uterus !
do you hear me ?
don' t touch my things without asking .
so our lives are difficult and perhaps unpardonable ,
and the fey gauds of youth have as the old men told us they would , faded .
but still , it is morning again , this day .
in the flowering trees , the birds take up their indifferent , elegant cries .
look around .
perhaps it isn' t too late to make a fool of yourself again .
perhaps it isn' t too late to flap your arms and cry out ,
to give one more cracked rendition of your singular , aspirant song .
is this where they have it ?
yep .
you can hold on to that , if you' d like .
no lunch ?
no .
come on , here .
oh , no , thanks .
it' s ok .
no , no .
i will be offended if you don' t .
what kind of bread is this ?
it' s rosemary .
you' ve never had it before ?
tell your mom if she has any questions she can call me .
do you think she' il be able to come with you ?
i haven' t asked her yet .
if your family can' t afford to send you the school might consider ...
we can afford it .
blue car " .
do you think i could win ?
the girl wants to win .
maybe i should write that here on the application , huh ?
well , no , maybe i should change my poem .
write about america write about something nice .
no .
you write what you care about .
can you read me some of your novel ?
what do you mean , my novel ?
georgia told me .
i' m not gonna copy you or anything .
just for inspiration .
in one creative thought a thousand nights of love revive , filling it with sublimity and exaltation .
and those who come together in the night in a rocking delight , do an earnest work , and gather sweetnesses , gather depth and strength for the song of some coming poet who will arise to speak of ecstasies beyond telling .
and though they err and embrace blindly the future comes all the same .
it' s beautiful .
sorry .
no ...
what' s up ?
can i have some money for lunch ?
meg , this is my son rob .
this is meg .
hi .
thanks .
i never realised he was your son .
that' s my son .
ready or not the future comes all the same .
where' s mom ?
she took me to the doctor .
what did he do ?
the usual .
we met don afterwards .
did she get the job ?
i don' t look like anyone .
not even myself .
he said not to indulge her .
when she gets hungry enough , she' il eat .
he' s a quack , mom .
she hasn' t had anything but water in two weeks .
she' s probably eating at school .
maybe we could take her to florida .
over spring break .
it' s a really good place for sick people .
i cannot afford the bills i have , megan .
i can' t take you on a vacation .
well , if you get the job , then ...
i' m not getting the job .
angels don' t fall out of the sky .
they emerge from within .
there is an angel within each one of you and he is your personal bridge to heaven .
this is the body of christ .
this is the body of christ .
blessed are the pure at heart for they shall see god .
i' m an angel .
the lord knows you are , my child .
the body of christ .
the body of christ .
lily ...
lily ?
oh , god ...
honey ?
lily ?
lily ?
honey ?

i' m sorry to bother you .
well , i just wanted to talk .
my sister' s not doing very well .
mr kastran ?
i have a family emergency .
ls it ok if i go home early ?
my dad' s here .
are there any customers upstairs ?
no .
go ahead .
thank you .
megan , she' s gonna be ok .
i don' t know .
no , she will .
she' s in the hospital now , and they' re gonna take very good care of her .
it' s ok .
she' s gonna be fine .
i wanna take her to florida .
everything' s gonna be fine .
i' m not gonna listen to my mom any longer .
you gonna be ok ?
yeah .
sorry if i got stuff all over your shirt .
it' s not a problem .
why are you so nice to me ?
i mean , i' m glad .
thanks for coming .
anytime .
where the hell have you been ?
i forgot my backpack .
where were you ?
work .
i called work .
they said that you left with your father .
how did you get home ?
a friend .
i have been driving around for two hours looking for you .
i called your father .
he had absolutely no idea what i was talking about .
you wanna go to florida ?
i can' t even trust you two miles from home .
get in there .
you can go to school and to work and to the hospital .
that' s it .
you will come straight home after work and if you don' t , then you don' t get to work .
do you understand me ?
and when i find out who your little boyfriend is ,
i' m gonna tell his parents he' s an inconsiderate little brat .
unfortunately , we do need your mother to co sign for any withdrawals .
but it' s my account .
that' s the way the account was set up .
i wish that you could stay with us .
i wish that you could stay with us .
do you guys drive ?
no , we fly .
unless pat goes .
but he' s on parole , thank god .
the four of us in one car for ten hours is basically hell .
you know , you probably could stay with us .
i don' t think tampa' s very far from siesta beach .
that way all you' d have to do is pay for the airline ticket .
i don' t know these people .
they' re really nice .
did they invite us , or is this just georgia ?
georgia said that she was gonna ask her family .
if you need to work , then i could take lily and you can have a break .
i don' t know , megan .
i just ...
hello ?
could you close that door , honey ?
yeah .
because i don' t believe you .
well , what about my family ?
here .
i got you some chocolate , too .
your favourite .
they can make you disappear in the night .
they break the doors and windows and then they amputate the wings .
can you see them ?
what ?
wings .
they won' t grow because there' s invisible food in the tubes .
lily , you don' t need wings .
we' re gonna fly to florida .
in a plane .
the ceiling' s too low .
what did they say ?
they' re gonna move her .
where ?
the psychiatric wing .
hey .
everything ok at home ?
oh , yeah .
everything' s fine .
um , i was just wondering if it would be possible to get my pay in cash this week .
that could probably be arranged .
thanks a lot .
you bet .
when did you purchase these ?
couple of weeks ago .
they were , like , $40 each .
you bought them here ?
yeah .
this isn' t our stock .
perhaps if you can find your receipt ?
i got ' em at the beermans in oakmeadow .
i' m afraid i can' t help you .
oh , god , no ...
it' s lily .
the window was open , and she fell .
oh , jesus , god , no !
we deliver her up to you , o lord to your arms and your mercy .
the 23rd psalm .
the lord is my shepherd ; i shall not want .
he makes me lie down in green pastures ; he leads me beside still waters .
he restores my soul .
he leads me in right paths for his name' s sake ...
i don' t belong here ?
for god' s sake , she' s my daughter !
you wouldn' t know it !
you don' t come around ...
and whose fault is that , exactly ?
am i the one trying to turn the kids against you ?
i' m going to work .
yeah .
yeah , all right , fine .
that' s how we' il handle it , then .
bye .
do you have any personal belongings here ?
no .
good .
clear out .
your pay should just about cover the cost of the ties .
get out of my store .
i need my money .
you should' ve thought of that before you stole from me .
i didn' t steal anything !
get out of here anyway .
i didn' t steal anything !
asshole !
what are you doing ?
where are they ?
the things you stole .
i didn' t steal anything .
i thought we were done with this .
get out of my room .
when you contribute to the rent of this place , then it' il be your room .
hey !
hey , that' s my stuff !
go ahead , ground me .
you' re never even home .
what are you gonna do , hire an armed guard ?
i' m going to florida , or wherever else i wanna go .
it' s none of your business .
then maybe you better find someplace else to live .
fine .
i' il go live with dad .
oh , good .
you do that .
you think he' s so wonderful ?
you go see how you like it over there .
at least he doesn' t try to control everything i do .
your father doesn' t give a shit about you .
how many times did he come around here last year ?
what , three ?
he doesn' t come here because of you !
he can' t even manage to pay the lousy $60 a week in child support he owes me !
i am up to here in debts trying to give you a life i can' t afford !
i work 12 hours a day and go to school at night so that i can make life nice for you , and all that i ask is that you respect the few rules that i lay down .
and when i stick my neck out to get you a job , you don' t embarrass me in front of my friends .
that' s all you care about , isn' t it ?
what ?
your stupid friends !
stupid don !
you' re an ungrateful brat .
what do you think you' re doing ?
you can' t just pack her away into a storage unit like you did with dad .
put that back in there .
she' s not yours , you fucking bitch !
i' m sure your mother feels a tremendous grief .
and to lose a child is ...
well , my son lucas was only four .
you wanna tell me how you feel ?
i don' t know .
how do you think your sister would feel if she lost you ?
sad .
yeah ...
i don' t know ...
mad ?
well , who would she be mad at ?
my mom .
why would she be mad at your mom ?
do you think your mom could' ve saved her ?
maybe i ...
maybe i could have .
this is not your fault .
it' s not your ...
oh , come here .
you are very beautiful .
and you are ... and you are very ...

this poem ... po em ... is for mr auster .
it' s called " now that i' ve read your book " .
i' ve memorised the lines .
it was easy .
the dirty white pages a margin of fancy designs .
you draw outlines of inverted hearts .
but mine' s real , not a valentine .
as for the details ...
as for the details fiction , fiction , lies , lies ,
i am the coming poet who will arise .
crippled phoenix i fly up from your bed of ashes .
when my dad left , i cut off my hands and sewed up my eyes .
but that didn' t keep me from reaching for you .
thank you for the gold star and your leaving .

to the place where they sell penny candy ?
and it was you , me , lily and mom .
and we were driving over the bumps on the road so fast it felt like we were flying .
