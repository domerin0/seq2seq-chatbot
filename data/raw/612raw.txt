forthose ofyou who thinkyoucamehere today ... to hear us tell you like these negro leaders do ... thatyour times will just get better ... that weshall overcomesomeday ...
i say toyou , you came to the wrong place .
becauseyour times will never get better unless you make them better .
those ofyou who thinkyou came here to hear us tell you ... to turn the other cheek to the brutality ofthe white man ... and this system ofinjustice that' s in place right here in america ... you thinkyou' re gonna come here and hear us tell you ... to go out there and beg for a place at their lunch counter ... again , i sayyou came to the wrong place .
we don' t teach you to turn the other cheek in the south .
and we don' t teach you to turn the other cheek in the north .
the honorable elijah muhammad teaches you to obey the law ... to carryyourselves in a respectable way ... in a proud afro american way .
but at the same time , we teach you ... that anyone puts their hand on you ... brother , you doyour best to see they don' t put their hand on anybody else ... again .

the heavyweight championship ofthe world is on the line .
ifit goes past the first round , there will be surprises already .
sonny liston wrapped in that terry cloth towel ofhis ... wrapped around his head swami fashion ...
iooking as malevolent and baleful as ever .
but this man is a professional prizefighter .
make no mistake about it .
i want a clean fight .
when i say break , stop punching and step back .
doyou have any questions , champ ?
any questions , challenger ?
we' re fine .
touch gloves , gentlemen .
good luck .
good evening , sports fans across the nation .
liston in the white trunks with the black stripes .
clay , an inch and a halftaller , in the white trunks with the red stripes
and cassius clay is sidestepping .
there it is , champ .
stay on your toes now .
and we can see that the champion is the aggressor .
there' s a shot under the heart .
cassius clay slips away .
and now clay pounds a left .
another left .
a straightjab .
it seems to have stunned him .
and that' s the bell .
and they' re fighting after the bell .
and they' re still fighting .
this round is over .
break it up , ref .
there is no love lost between the two contenders at this time .
cassius goes back to his corner .
it' s been an amazing round .
you can beat this guy .
i' m still here .
and sonny liston is not taking the stool .
he' s anxious to get back into the challenger' s face .
take it to the body .
kill the body , the head will follow .
this is a totally different fight than liston expected ... and anyone in this arena will tell you .
there' s a long , looping left hand .
clay' s eyes are wide open now .
come on , cass !
move !
step back .
come on , cassius !
come on , chi chi !
i' m not prognosticating anything ... but merely his survival to thisjuncture
cass , hit him !
break .
let him go .
sonny liston is hurt .
he' s bleeding from his eye .
he' s defying the experts early .
we have to take a look at this man and say he is not in awe ofthe champion .
he ain' t nothin ' to me .
and he know it .
this is it now .
let me have that, john .
and now they' re ready .

it' s clay coming on .
and liston backs away .
and all the predictions are going down the drain ... as liston is listless .

i am cassius x.
minister malcolm .
what about the divisions in the nation oflslam ?
this is the champ' s time .
i' m here as a friend to support his victory ... so i have nothing you want .
i' m definitely gonna be the people' s champion ... but i just ain' t gonna be the champ the wayyou want me to be the champ .
i' m gonna be the champ the way i wanna be .
... fornohomeis immune to termites ... nomatterhow well itisbuiltormaintained .
hey , brother .
i was leaving .
i sawyour light on .
whatyou doing up at this hour , champ ?
oh , man , i' m watching this program on termites .
and them little itsy bitsy things is eatin ' these people' s whole house down .
oh , man , look .
i' ve been invited to speak at lbadan university in nigeria .
you wanna go with me ?
hey , look , man .
you can have six million termites in your house and don' t even know it ... till you going to get something to eat and you bust through the floor .
what' d you say ?
where ?
africa .
you been ?
africa .
all right , come on .
let' s go .
what is it ?
you ever thought you' d lose it ?
i mean , really lose it ?
when i was little , i tore out this picture of emmett till .
they put the barbed wire around his neck ... and strapped him to that 75 pound cotton gin fan .
and they cut out one ofhis eyes ' cause he looked at some white lady .
man .
i couldn' t take my eyes to it , couldn' t throw it away .
when i heard about those ... four little girls who got bombed in that birmingham church ...
the prohibitions ofthe honorable elijah muhammad prevented me ... from speaking my thoughts in action .
because birmingham was part ofthe civil rights struggle .
you know , begging for our place at the white man' s table .
but dead children are dead children .
so the anger i felt i had to contain .
i locked it up so tight ... my muscles seized .
i lost control over the right side ofmy body .
my leg gave out .
right arm gave out .
i' m having a stroke , " i thought .
but i had to hold it in ' cause all i wanted
brother , all i wanted to do was find something and break it .
break a part break any part ofthis system ... becauseyou are so provoked in your heart ... and your spirit as a human being ... at dead children .
and i could do ... nothing .
everyone knows i can' t do nothing ... anymore .
so elijah muhammad has suspended me as a minister in the nation oflslam .
man ... you can fix that .
i don' t know .
i' il trywhen we get back .
you get some rest , champ .
all right , brother .
sit .
you know , only after long service and high merit ... in the spiritual and physical rebirth ofafro american people ... is one granted an original name .
butyou are special .
a world champion .
so there is a gift i wish to giveyou .
from this day forward ... you will be known as muhammad ali .
what ?
that' s right .
you what ?
well , what' s wrong with our name ?
my name ?
we we madeyou .

but thepunch lifts frazier clean outofthering .
frazier' s still risin ' , and the referee wears a frown ...

it will raise up the spirits ofour inner cities .

he' s too slow .
you know i name all my fighters .
i' m gonna call george foreman " the mummy .
he fight like a mummy .
here come the left .
here come the right .
but the mummy can' t hit what the mummy can' t see ...
' cause i' m too fast for him .
i' m too fast .
i' m too fast .
i' m too fast .
i move too good for him .
i' il hit george foreman so many times , he' il think he' s surrounded .
he gonna say , " call the police !
it' s five of' em in here !
i' m bad , man .
i' m bad !
muhammad , i' m sorry .
i have to ask .
areyou really fast enough anymore ... to beat george foreman ?
ifhe gets you against the ropes , he can knockyou out with either hand .
many people believeyou' re not the man you used to be ten years ago .
see , now , howard ...
i didn' t even want to talk about this , man .
especially not out here in front ofall these people .
but i talked toyourwife ... and she said you not the man you used to be twoyears ago !
champ .
champ , george had an accident .
he he had what ?
what areyou talking about ?
he got cut right above his right eye .
his sparring partner' s elbow split it open .
can he fight ?
not for six weeks .
this is not a humorous situation , my champ .
this postponement could be long , especially ifgeorge leaves .
you trying to pull something here , don ?
ifgeorge leaves , he ain' t comin ' back .
george don' t like it here .
how rightyou are , my suspicious and short ltalian brother .
look here , man , my fiduciary responsibility ... to this first all black promotion ... is analogous to a garden in the african sun it must grow , it must bloom .
cannot flower in the gloom and shade ofpostponement to the astrodome ... or any dome out ofzaire where it be deprivileged oflight and bled ofwater .
' cause what gonna be bleedin ' out of there is money a hemorrhage ofcash .
i' m talkin ' about blood on the floor .
double hotel costs , airplane , travel costs , food and beverage .
so what doyou want us to do ?
muhammad ali .
the people' s champion .
my black brother .
i need you .
i need your strength .
i need you to find a way to get george to stay .
be moses in reverse .
do not let my people go .
keep them the fuck right here in egypt .
ifyou' il pardon my swahili .
lingala .
saywhat ?
they speak lingala .
ali wants his title , and he wants it in zaire .
okay , all right , okay .
let' s take it back .
george go , george go .
hell , i can getyoujoe frazier .
ali frazier 3 .
that' s the fight everybodywant to see .
we don' t want frazier , we want george .
hell , i don' t control george foreman .
there' s been an accidental injury to george foreman in training .
the truth is ...
george knocked hisselfout .
that' s right .
he did three rounds , realized he was gonna lose to muhammad ali ... and knocked hisselfout .
i predict that when the fight is set , he might not show .
oh , you bad .
that' s right , i' m a bad man .
ain' t no doubt about that .
yeah , butyou tell george the same thing .
i heard you .
i been watching you .
i know he' s your man , i knowyou got him picked , but the man is in trouble .
the whole world was gonna know , but now he ain' t gonna show .
in order to ensure that george is ready , we are thinking ofpostponing ... from september 24 to october 30 .
what about the concert ?
the concert will go on as planned .
those dates are september 20 , 21
i want all the helicopters guarded , all the private planes , private boats .
i' m serious .
i want the airports
i want president mobutu and all his paratroopers
all you zaireans , y' all be on guard too .
any strange boats creeping away , they might be taking him out .
