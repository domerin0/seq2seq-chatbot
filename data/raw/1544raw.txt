mr. angel .
allow me to introduce my client , monsieur louis cyphre .
hiya .
harry angel .
pleased to meet you , mr. angel .
i don' t want to appear rude or impolite , but do you have any i. d. , before we begin ?
sure .
yeah .
here .
let me see what i got here .
how' s that ?
nothing personal .
it' s just that i' m a little overcautious .
you know how these things are .
oh , i know .
so , how did you hear about me ?
i guess you guys just looked in the phone book , huh ?
usually that' s what happens .
because my name is angel .
it' s under a' s .
people ...
you know , people are lazy .
they flick through .
they see the first name in the book .
johnny favorite .
excuse me ?
do you by chance remember the name johnny favorite ?
remember the name johnny ?
no , i don' t think so .
you never knew him ?
am i supposed to know him ?
he was a crooner before the war .
quite famous in his way .
well , i' il tell ya , mr. " cyphre , " you know , i ...
mr. cyphre .
i' m sorry , baby .
i' m sorry .
mr. cyphres .
i usually don' t get involved in anything really heavy .
insurance jobs , divorces , things of that nature .
i get lucky , sometimes i handle people .
but i don' t know no , you know , crooners ... or anybody famous , you know ?
his real name was liebling .
i don' t ...
i don' t know any liebling either .
so what is it you guys want from me ?
does this man owe you money ?
not quite .
i gave johnny some help at the beginning of his career .
so were you , like , his ... his agent ?
no , no , no .
nothing so ...
monsieur cyphre has a contract .
certain collateral was involved , to be forfeited in the event of his death .
you' re losin ' me a little bit .
are we talkin ' about a guy who' s dead ?
no , he was drafted in ' 43 .
north africa .
special entertainment services .
there was an attack .
he was badly injured about the head and face .
he had ...
amnesia , i think you call it .
shell shock ?
shell shock .
yes .
i know how that feels .
why ?
were you in the services ?
yes , i was in for a short period of time .
but i got a little fucked up real quick .
excuse my language .
and they shipped me back home ... and i sort of missed the whole shebang .
you know , the war , the medals , the whole nine yards .
and i guess you could say i was lucky .
well , johnny wasn' t so lucky .
he returned home a virtual zombie .
favorite' s friends had him transferred to a private hospital upstate .
there was some sort of radical psychiatric treatment involved .
favorite' s lawyers had the power of attorney to ...
pay the bills , things like that .
but you know how these things are .
he remained a vegetable , and my contract was never honored .
i see .
i don' t want to sound mercenary or anything , but you must understand ... that my interest in johnny is only in finding out if he' s alive ... or if he' s dead .
each year my office receives a signed affidavit confirming ... that johnny liebling is indeed among the living .
until this last weekend , when quite by chance ...
monsieur cyphre and i were in the vicinity of the hospital just outside poughkeepsie .
we decided to check for ourselves but were given misleading information .
yeah , the runaround .
yes .
i didn' t want to cause a scene .
i hate to have any sort of a fuss .
so i thought perhaps you could ... subtly , in a more quiet manner ...
you want me to check it out .
check it out .
okay .
yeah .
it' s funny .
i have a feeling i' ve met you before .
i don' t know .
i don' t think so .
do you by chance remember the name johnny favorite ?
his real name was liebling .
my interest in johnny is only in finding out if he' s alive or if he' s dead .
may i help you ?
yes .
my name is harry conroy , and i' m with the national institute of health .
is there anyone in particular you' d like to see , mr. conroy ?
the institute is conducting a survey of incurable trauma cases ... and i understand you have a patient here fitting that description .
i' m afraid we can' t let you see anyone without an appointment , sir .
oh , sure .
i appreciate that .
but maybe , you know ... you could check the files and make sure i' m on the right track .
i don' t want to bother anybody unnecessarily .
okay ?
thank you .
what' s the name of the patient ?
liebling .
jonathan liebling .
one moment please .
i will check .
so , was you workin ' here last weekend ?
no .
day off .
did you do anything nice ?
my sister' s wedding .
we did have a mr. liebling ... but it says here he was transferred .
are you sure ?
yeah , that' s what it says here .
well , when was that ?
years ago .
december ' 43 .
may i take a look at this ?
thank you .
is this recent ?
it' s an old file .
it' s in ballpoint .
you know , they weren' t too big on ballpoint in ' 43 .
is that ballpoint ?
yeah .
well , i' il be .
they didn' t have ballpoints back then ?
no .
this here dr. fowler ... does he still work here ?
just part time .
he' s old .
thank you .
about time for your evening fix ?
who are you ?
how' d you get in here ?
through the mail slot .
i' m a private detective .
breaking and entering is a serious crime , whoever or whatever you are .
well , hey , man , call the police .
which you won' t do in case they discover your little opium den ... you got in the icebox there .
i' m a doctor .
i' m perfectly entitled to keep pharmaceuticals at home .
hey , look , doc , tell it to somebody else , all right ?
we' re not talkin ' about a band aid and two bongateen .
how long you been hooked ?
what do you want of me ?
information about johnny liebling .
i vaguely remember treating a patient of that name many years ago .
hey , look , doc , i' m not foolin ' around here .
either you start giving me some straight answers , or i' il call the police myself .
i' ve seen the works cookin ' upstairs , pal , and it ain' t mr. salk' s vaccine .
i remember .
he was in detainer during the war .
neuro case .
no chance of recovery .
so we transferred him to a v. a. hospital in albany .
hey , doc , i hate to shake you up , but i checked with albany .
he' s not there .
you faked the transfer .
well , i did that quickly because he had a visitor recently .
in 12 years , he hadn' t had a visitor .
popular guy , huh ?
where is he now ?
i honestly don' t know .
look .
come here .
i haven' t seen him since he was a patient in the war .
look , doc , you' re in a cold sweat .
look at you .
you can' t wait for me to leave here so you can raid the goodies in the icebox .
now , the sooner you get out with it ... the sooner you can shoot yourself to palookaville , okay ?
i' m gonna ask you again .
where is he ?
i don' t know .
some people came one night many years ago .
he got in the car with him and drove away .
i never saw him again .
he got into a car ?
i thought this guy was a vegetable .
when he first came here , he was in a coma , but he soon recovered .
but he still suffered from acute amnesia .
the friends ?
who were the friends ?
the gentleman' s name was kelly .
edward kelly .
the young lady , i don' t know her .
she stayed in the car .
where were they taking him ?
i think down south .
the man said , " we' re taking him home .
what was the deal ? $25, 000 .
for what ?
to maintain the pretense that he was still a patient in the hospital .
well , didn' t the administration suspect ?
but why should they ?
i kept the charts up to date ... and no one asks questions when the bills get paid .
i want you to tell me about johnny liebling .
what did he look like ?
i have no idea what he looked like .
his face was damaged .
he had extensive facial reconstruction .
he was still in bandages the day he left .
tell me about this guy kelly .
it' s so long .
i have only a vague memory .
come on .
i can' t remember .
he was well dressed .
he had a southern accent .
l ...
what ?
truly can' t remember .
all right , doc .
all right .
hey .
we' re gonna have a little lie down , all right ?
i' m gonna go out , and i' m gonna grab a cheeseburger .
maybe a few hours cold turkey will refresh your memory .
all right ?
come on .
watch yourself there .
okay , doc .
we' re gonna take a little nap now .
sit your ass down .
i' m gonna clear your mind a little bit .
i' m gonna go out .
maybe when i get back ...
i' il fix you some goodies from the icebox , all right ?
listen , you tell me what i want to know , i' il be out of your hair forever .
johnny .
harry .
harry .
harry .
hey , i' m back , doc .
i brought you a little somethin ' .
i didn' t think you' d want a cheeseburger and a shake .
i won' t .
bye .
bye .
hey , allie .
hey , harry .
that your boyfriend ?
he got a car and everything ?
yeah .
yeah ?
yeah .
ohh .
bye .
see you later .
did you see him ?
no .
why not ?
' cause it would have been difficult .
why ?
why ?
' cause he' s not there .
your johnny favorite walked out of sarah harvest dodd' s 12 years ago ... wearin ' his best suit and a new face wrapped in bandages .
with a headache .
he took off with some guy called kelly and a girl .
do you know this kelly ?
well , it seems that this guy kelly paid off ... some bent doctor called fowler to pinch hit for your guy all these years .
he' s been coverin ' up for him ever since .
it looks like our johnny has found himself a perfect disappearing act .
it seems so .
you know what they say about slugs .
no , what do they say about slugs ?
they always leave slime in their tracks .
you' il find him .
no , i won' t find him .
' cause i left out one little detail .
this dr. fowler guy ended up dead with his fuckin ' brains blown out all over .
fowler ?
yeah , fowler .
did you kill him ?
no , i didn' t kill him .
but the cops might think i did .
hey , look .
i took on $125 a day missing persons job with you .
now i' m a murder suspect .
that' s it .
i' m out .
such are the hazards of your profession , mr. angel .
if the fee bothers you , we can have it adjusted .
no , cyphre , you bother me .
listen , the closest i ever come ... to death is standin ' on the corner on 2nd avenue watching the stiffs go by ... in the hearse , all right , that' s the way i like it .
are you afraid ?
yeah , i' m afraid .
i' il instruct my lawyer immediately to send you a check for $5, 000 .
if you don' t want the job , i' il engage someone else .
$5, 000 ? $5, 000 .
you must want this johnny pretty bad .
i don' t like messy accounts .
you know , some religions think that the egg is the symbol of the soul .
did you know that ?
no , i didn' t know that .
would you like an egg ?
no , thank you .
i got a thing about chickens .
i' ve got a higher plane
i' ve got a higher plane
oh , yeah
a higher plane oh , yeah
i don' t know why
i' ve found it
i' ve got a higher plane oh , i ...
gavilan weighs 146 pounds tonight , just a pound ... under the welterweight limit .

if i lose my job , i' il come and be your secretary .
hey , i couldn' t pay you what the times pays .
besides , they' re not gonna miss it .
they must be digging up stuff like this all the time .
hiya , johnny .
where the fuck are you ?
johnny favorite was a crooner , like you said .
i didn' t realize he was so big .
he used to be in a band called the spider simpson orchestra .
all dead .
only spider' s here in town .
oh , yeah ?
where is he ?
i wrote it all down .
the dyke in archiving' s library is getting suspicious .
my boss hasn' t researched a story in years .
you can get the files .
spider' s in an old people' s home on 138th street .
oh , wonderful .
i get to go to harlem again .
there was a picture of johnny with a guy called toots sweet .
a guitar player .
and ?
no one' s heard of him for years .
now here' s the juicy bit .
he was engaged to a rich broad , name of margaret krusemark .
dad ethan owns half of louisiana .
met johnny at a high school prom in new orleans .
johnny shit on her , and she went back home to daddy .
oh , yeah , there' s lots under spells .
spells ?
what do you mean , spells ?
you mean like eye of a newt and toe of a frog , that kind of shit ?
seems she' s a bit of a crackpot .
casting spells at society do' s and stuff .
didn' t go down too well with the ivy league stiffos .
oh , yeah , she was known as the witch of wellesley .
the witch of wellesley .
did i do good ?
yeah , you did great .
so , what do i got ?
i got some kind of religious loony for a client .
i gotta find johnny golden tonsils .
we don' t know where he is .
he probably doesn' t know who he is .
i got a geriatric bandleader at a home in harlem .
i got a guitar player called toots sweet .
what else i got ?
a hard on .
are you okay ?
january 3 , 1955 .
winesap and mackintosh , attorneys .
as reported , johnny favorite has not been ... in the sarah dodd nursing home of poughkeepsie for the last 12 years .
he was taken away by a man called edward kelly and a girl .
the girl is unidentified .
kelly paid a dr. fowler $25, 000 to falsify reports ... stating favorite was still at the hospital .
the doctor is now deceased .
before johnny' s accident , it seemed his career was goin ' great ... till he started to dump on everyone around him .
i tracked down spider simpson , johnny' s old bandleader .
spider now resides at the lincoln presbyterian hospice ... for the elderly , on 138th street .
johnny also had a close buddy , a guitar player called toots sweet .
toots went back to algiers .
that ain' t algiers in africa .
that' s algiers in new orleans .
i think maybe margaret went back there too , and maybe johnny .
oh , yeah .
according to spider , johnny had a secret love .
a black lady called evangeline proudfoot .
evangeline ran some kind of spooky store in harlem ... called mammy carter' s .
you don' t need to know that , cyphre .
i think secret loves should stay secret .
and the only other person johnny was seeing regularly ... was a palm reader out in coney island called madame zora .
hey , you izzy ?
yeah .
it looks like the last of the sun , huh ?
yep .
hey , listen .
the guy in the arcade over there told me you might be able to help .
oh , yeah ?
yeah .
i' m lookin ' for a madame zora .
yeah , sure , i know her .
a friend of the wife before the war .
it' s the fortune teller , right ?
yeah , and then some .
real creepy .
i hate those hocus pocus bitches .
fuckin ' witch .
her and the wife got along real well .
the wife' s a baptist .
oh , here .
have a nose shield .
go on .
take one .
i found a whole boxful under the boardwalk .
there' s not much sun in the city right now .
yeah , but it keeps the rain off too .
hey , listen .
you ever hear of a johnny favorite ?
the singer ?
the crooner .
used to visit madame zora all the time ?
i heard of him , but i don' t know nothin ' about him .
ask the wife .
she' il know .
she' s always singin ' stupid tunes off the radio .
she knows all that kind of shit .
she likes the water , huh ?
nope .
hates it .
she' s gettin ' on the heavy side .
she thinks it' s good for varicose veins .
all right .
thanks .
listen .
what do you do around here in the summertime ?
i bite the heads off of rats .
what do you do in the winter ?
same .
excuse me !
i was just talkin ' to your husband over there !
i was inquiring about a madame zora !
yeah , i knew her before the war .
madame zora , you say ?
yeah , she was some kind of gypsy fortune teller .
yeah , she used to have the booth across the boardwalk from me .
she weren' t no gypsy .
she was a debutante .
she was messin ' with more than readin ' tea leaves .
did you ever see her with a guy called johnny favorite ?
yeah , he was cute .
used to visit her all the time .
she was real stuck on him .
the guy with the golden tonsils , they used to call him .
i knew all his tunes .
hey , did you ever hear of a ... of a margaret krusemark ?
don' t be a gazoony , fella .
madame zora was margaret krusemark .
well , what happened to her ?
packed up her stuff one day and closed up for good .
went back home .
down south .
do you have any idea where i could find johnny favorite ?
nope .
maybe the cemetery .
wanna hear one of his tunes ?
i cried for you
now it' s your turn to cry over ...
hey , thanks for the nose shield .
okay .
i' m gonna need it where i' m goin ' .
in brooklyn ?
nah .

where' d he go ?
mr. angel .
sorry to keep you waitin ' .
you' re a little early .
well , i had a bad line .
i didn' t know if it was 4 : 00 or 4 : 30 .
wow , this is really a wild place you got here .
yes , i' ve been very happy here .
hey , you know , i never had my fortune read before .
does this take long ?
i' il just take the details now .
it usually takes me a couple of days to do a chart .
tea ?
do you want some tea ?
oh , yes .
thank you .
darjeeling , jasmine or oolong ?
oolong .
not many people like oolong .
you play the piano ?

oh .
i' m sorry .

now .
i' m gonna need your exact date of birth .

okay , i was ... born february 14 .

that' s valentine' s day .
how curious .
i used to know a boy who was born on that exact same date .
oh ?
really ?
well , you know how it is .
all the soldiers home on leave and all .
hey , maybe we could pull your friend' s chart and save ourselves some time .
i don' t think so , mr. angel .
every person' s very different .
i don' t think you' d like his chart .
place of birth ?
brooklyn , new york .
why , was he a jerk or something , your friend ?
yeah , you could say that .
so , i guess you just didn' t get along .
you and johnny .
you and johnny favorite ?
who are you ?
i was an old army buddy .
i thought that you two were kind of a ...
you know .
all right .
look .
i ain' t no army buddy .
i' m just a guy who was paid to snoop around .
but to tell you the truth , i wasn' t born on valentine' s day .
it' s johnny' s future that i' m interested in .
johnny has no future .
he' s dead .
he died 12 years ago , and mr. angel , i' d like you to leave .
look , i know you' re probably thinking who' s this creep lookin ' to snitch around .
i don' t want to sound nosy or nothin ' , but ...
he' s dead , mr. angel .
and if he isn' t , he is to me .
wow .
he must' ve hurt you pretty bad .
we all have our scars , mr. angel .
well , look .
you know , i don' t know too much about this guy ... but he must' ve been really stupid if he let you go .
lies and cruelty come very easy to some people .
good bye , mr. angel .
it' s a pity .
you know , i really would' ve liked to have gotten my palm read .
could' ve held your hand a little while longer .
i don' t think you' d like what i see .
that' s a very pretty necklace you got there .

did you ever meet him ?
he was supposed to be a pretty good guitar player .
i was gonna go try to catch his act tonight .

your name suits you .
chickens .
hey , what are you after him for ?
johnny favorite ?
i' m not really after him .

what' s the story with this proudfoot girl ?
she' s a mambo priestess , like her mom .
has been since she was 13 .
when' s the last time you saw johnny favorite at one of those chicken stuffings ?
he used to run around with mom mambo , didn' t he ?
i told you , i ain' t seen him since before the war .
what about the chicken foot in the john , huh ?

i' il tell you what .
i' m gonna give you my hotel number , and you give me a call ... in case you hear anything .
you never know , the next time you get ... a special delivery chicken foot , you may need a little help .
i' il tell you , as far as i' m concerned ... any dead chicken' s a good chicken to me .
hey , only cops and bad news don' t knock .
only private dicks sleep so late .

i was on my way to mandalay again .

toots sweet is dead ?
yeah .
toots sweet .
only this one weren' t so quick .
this one took time .
how did he die ?
technically , asphyxiation by his own genitalia .
but not so technically .
somebody cut his dick off , stuffed it in his mouth and choked him to death .
took to redecoratin ' his apartment with the poor jerk' s blood .
so , when' d you see him , angel ?
i interviewed him yesterday around 1 : 00 .
in connection with what ?
missing person .
who ?
some cat took a walk 12 years ago .
i saw toots in an old photograph with him .
what' s the name of this party you' re lookin ' for ?
sorry , friend .
can' t say .
that' s right of privacy .
i' m workin ' for a new york lawyer .
name ?
ah , come on , man .
winesap .

yeah .
herman winesap .

that' s it .
you and your " right to privacy " can go eat lunch .
but don' t stroll too far , angel .
not till we talk to this lawyer of yours .
you ever watch the mickey mouse club ?

today is wednesday .
it' s " anything can happen " day .
hey , man , you want a tune ?
yeah , i got a tune for you .

well , right now , i ...
i need a laundry .
listen , " epithany .
epiphany .
epiphany .
i got something on my mind i wanna ask you .
yeah .
the other night i saw you and toots sweet ... boogyin ' with the cock a doodle doo out in the woods .
looked like you all were havin ' some party .
yeah , so what' s your problem ?
it' s a free country .
not for chickens it ain' t .
oh , yeah , you got a thing about chickens .
i remember .
listen , epiphany , toots is ...
toots is dead .
i know .
i heard .
and you set him up .
no , i didn' t .
you were the only one that knew i was seein ' toots .
yeah .
you' re the one that sent the gift wrapped chicken for two , aren' t you ?
yeah , well , toots had a big mouth .
i guess he did , judgin ' by what the cops found in it .
quite a cute religion you got .
well , nailing a man to a cross ain' t so cute , either .
yeah , i know .
you got to kill a chicken to make the soup .
we don' t go around murdering people , all right ?
what about johnny favorite ?
oh .
so now you remember him after all , huh ?
yeah , he was my father .
mince ?
mince , i' m gonna pick the baby up later , okay ?
he' s gonna be all right .
hey , look , if you got anything you' re holding out , now' s a good time to tell .
nothing to tell .
johnny never came back from the war .
mama waited .
mama died .
it' s sad and simple .
epiphany , there' s too many dead bodies floatin ' around ... even for louisiana .
i' d tell your old man to look out for you .
you do have a husband .
no .
no husband .
jesus , you got beautiful eyes , epiphany .
you really do .
they' re truly beautiful .
they' re the kind of eyes you can tell just what' s goin ' on inside .
right now you' re scared .
i manage .
hey , well , listen ...
yeah .
i' il call you if i hear anything .
hey .
call me if you don' t .
all right ?
i have a message for you .
thank you .
you' re welcome .
i' m so glad you could come .
yeah .
i didn' t know you were comin ' to town .
i have a speaking engagement in baton rouge ... and i thought it would be opportune to catch up on your progress .
i' m tellin ' ya ...
progress ain' t too good .
i found out a lot of stuff .
but so far , no johnny favorite .
how unfortunate .
all i got is a bellyful of hocus pocus ... and three stiffs .
stiffs ?
yeah .
dead bodies , mr. cyphre .
murders .
murders .
yeah .
i got fowler ...
johnny' s doctor bumped himself off .
i got this old voodoo guy , toots sweet .
he got choked to death with a part of the body meant for pissing with .
this is a church , mr. angel .
well , i' il tell you something .
i know it' s a church ... but there' s a lot of religion going around with this thing .
it' s very weird , and i don' t understand it .
it' s ugly .
they say there' s just enough religion in the world ... to make men hate one another , but not enough to make them love .
oh , is that what they say ?
well , i' il tell you something , mr. cyphre , there ... wasn' t too much love around for johnny favorite .
all right , that guy was bad luck and it' s starting to rub off on me .
i' m a murder suspect already in two cases .
the police found my name and my address in toots sweet' s hand .
i know .
winesap told me .
you must be careful , mr. angel .
and a third ?
you said there were three murders .
i checked out johnny' s little society girlfriend ...
margaret krusemark .
do you know her ?
vaguely .
vaguely ?
let me tell you , i' m a little fed up with fuckin ' " vaguely .
vaguely " is puttin ' a noose around my neck and i' m startin ' to choke .
so , mr. cyphre , did you know her or not ?
i knew about her , but i never actually knew her .
all right .
well , i' il tell you what .
she was doin ' my chart .
i gave her johnny' s birth date ...
february 14 ...
except someone got to her and took out their own valentine' s card .
they split her open and they cut out her heart .
i guess she couldn' t predict the future for herself .
the future isn' t what it used to be , mr. angel .
and your conclusions ?
i haven' t any .
all i know is johnny' s runnin ' around bumpin ' off everyone he used to know .
and more and more it' s me who' s on the line for it .
i' m bein ' set up , and it' s scarin ' the shit out of me , all right ?
so why don' t you just tell me and level with me what the fuck is goin ' on here ?
just johnny favorite and the debt that' s owed to me , mr. angel .
i have old fashioned ideas about honor .
you know , an eye for an eye , things like that .
who the fuck are you , cyphre ?
watch your language .
hey , i don' t give a fuck if this is a church , okay ?
churches give me the creeps .
i don' t like churches .
are you an atheist ?
yes , i am .
i' m from brooklyn .
i' il be in town for a day or two .
let me know what else you find , and if you need money ...
no , no , the money' s fine .
but if i ain' t careful , that 5, 000 bucks you gave me ... could just buy me a seat on the electric chair .
hi .
frightened eyes never lie .
come on .
come on inside .
where' s your child ?
he' s with mincy .
she' s bringing him over later .
she' s got 14 of her own , so he' il be okay there .
look , epiphany , you' re very welcome to stay here or i' il get you a room .
no , i' m okay .
i' il tell you what , i' m gonna have a drink .
you want a drink ?
you' re gonna have one anyway .
i' ve been thinkin ' , epiphany .
yeah ?
i was wondering what the hell your mama ever saw in a guy like johnny favorite ?
i don' t know .
whatever he had , he sure stole her heart away .
to tell you the truth , the guy was a creep .
well , she sure missed him .
i mean , i' il tell ya .
what does a lady see in a guy that runs around choppin ' up pigeons , you know ?
you know what they say .
it' s always the badass that makes a girl' s heart beat faster .
did she ever say anything about him ?
johnny ?
yeah .
just two things .
yeah , like what ?
she once said that johnny favorite was as close to true evil ... as she ever wanted to come .
what else did she say ?
he was a terrific lover .
how old are you , epiphany ?
seventeen .
seventeen .
that' s kind of young to have a kid , isn' t it ?
it' s old enough .
so , where' d the father go ?
i never knew him .
i' m sorry .
to tell you the truth .
i don' t know why i took this room .
it was at bamboucher .
when the spirits possess you , it' s called chevalier .
oh , yes , i' m familiar with that ...
chevrolet .
chevalier .
chevrolet .
mounted by the gods .
oh , so the gods got you pregnant ?
yeah .
i understand that .
sorry .
i' m not .
it was the best fuck i ever had .
want to dance ?
in here ?
yeah , here .
i got bit by a dog this mornin ' .
i can' t move around .
well , you won' t feel a thing .
well , i' il dance with you .
yeah ?
yeah .
but you gotta promise .
what' s that ?
no chickens .
okay .
come on .
jump on .
and i really
had my fun
with all the boyfriends
the good time men friends
i' ve still had to walk this road
all by myself
i was that playgirl
a careless gay girl
but i put
them all on the shelf
i found my true love
with you forever
and my life
has just begun
' cause now you' ve set
my soul
on fire
and i really
had my fun
good bye to playboys
those hey hey hey boys
good bye to everyone
but you , my love
well , no more heartaches
no more heartbreaks
i' il swear by all
the stars above
well , all my soul
my love , my heart
i miss you , darling
but i' m coming up
' cause now you' ve set
my soul
on fire
all right , i' m comin ' .
i should' ve recognized the knock .
well , at least you got reason for sleepin ' late this time .
down here , angel , we don' t mix with the jigaboos .
the colored folks keep to themselves .
well , hey , i ain' t from down here .
you cut yourself ?
a dog bit me .
somebody named margaret krusemark figure in this missing persons case ?
no .
why ?
she' s dead .
that nigger guitar player of yours , he don' t matter a shit .
he was into voodoo .
they 86' d one or two a week .
this krusemark dame , she comes from a louisiana money family ... white money .
so two people get bumped off in the same week .
what' s the connection ?
similar circumstances .
like what ?
did she get her dick cut off too ?
no .
some fucker cut her heart out , neat as a butcher on decatur street .
look , mine' s a missing persons .
it' s not a murder , okay ?
why you telling me this ?
i want to know the name of the party you' re lookin ' for .
i already told you .
call new york .
talk to the lawyer .
i did .
that fancy mouthpiece , he gave me the same big city shit as you .
what do you want me to say ?
hey , you and effie klinker over there ... why don' t you just fuck off and leave me alone ?
this ain' t jigaboo town , ass wipe !
you play jump rope with louisiana law ... and i' m gonna stuff your big city smarts right up your new york ass !
this krusemark broad , she was into stargazing , black magic , all kinds of shit .
there ain' t nothin ' worse for a cop than people who get killed for nutso reasons .
sorry if i made a mess .
maybe you can get your nigger to clean it up .
girl of my dreams
i love you
honest i do
you are so sweet
if i could just hold your charms
again in my arms
life ...
what' s that tune you' re singin ' ?
you don' t know it ?
it' s one by johnny favorite .
my mom used to sing it to me all the time .
you okay ?
yeah .
if i could just
hold your charms
again in my arms
life would be complete
shit !
thanks .
what do you want , mr. angel ?
i guess you already knew that .
why should i ?
a couple of your morons with a matching poodle ... have been chasing my balls around for days .
i' m looking for johnny favorite .
as far as i know , that dance band scumbag is dead .
that dance band scumbag may be the one that killed your daughter .
who' s employing you ?
i can' t say .
i' il pay .
so do they .
twelve years ago you and your daughter snatched favorite ... out of some nuthatch up in poughkeepsie .
you paid a junkie doctor 25 grand to pretend johnny was still a turniphead .
you did a pretty good job until a week ago .
you used the name edward kelly .
let' s walk over here .
it' s a little private , and you can sample our gumbo .
that' s all right .
i got a nasty stomach .
besides , cajun cooking kills me .
it' s a pity about your stomach .
you' d have enjoyed our gumbo .
i was edward kelly .
it was me who paid fowler the 25 g' s .
did favorite know you ?
no .
he acted like a sleepwalker .
he just stared out the window and watched the lights go by .
where were you takin ' him ?
times square .
it was new year' s eve , 1943 .
i just dropped him off ... in the crowd and he walked out of our lives forever , or so we thought .
you' re tellin ' me that you paid 25 grand for a guy and you lost him in a crowd ?
i did it for my daughter .
it was some sort of hocus pocus she and johnny were foolin ' around with .
my daughter was obsessed .
i know .
i found a mummified hand in her room .
the " hand of glory . " it was supposed to be able to open any lock .
it was the right hand of a convicted murderer ... cut off while his neck was still in the noose .
or so margaret believed .
black magic .
black , white , what difference does it make ?
margaret was always ...
evil .
evil is a dunghill , mr. angel .
everyone gets on his own and speaks out about someone else' s .
margaret wasn' t evil .
she was a strange kid , though .
she was into tarot cards before she could read .
who got her started ?
some maid , governess ... who knows ?
some maid , some governess ...
everything you tell me is a crock of shit !
you' re the one that got her started !
you' re the fuckin ' devil worshipper !
the prince of darkness protects the powerful .
that' s a crock of shit !
i can' t help it if you don' t believe .
you come straight with me , you slimebag , or i' il save this state an execution .
i introduced johnny favorite to my daughter .
he was very powerful .
i once watched him conjure up " lucifuge " in my living room .
he was in it much deeper than me .
he made a pact with satan .
he sold his soul .
you expect me to swallow that ?
swallow it .
spit it out .
i don' t give a damn .
that' s a crock of shit , you lying , old , fucking motherfucker !
he sold his soul for stardom .
for stardom ?
are you ...
that' s a crock of shit !
satan rose from the depth .
it was magnificent , except he thought he could outwit the prince of darkness .
johnny sold his soul .
then when he made it big , he tried to duck out of it .
that' s a crock of shit !
johnny came across an obscure rite in an ancient manuscript .
he needed a victim his own age .
why ?
to steal their soul .
so toots and johnny picked up a young soldier .
who ?
just a soldier celebrating new year' s eve in times square .
who was this soldier ?
they took him back to johnny' s hotel .
that' s where the ceremony took place .
what ceremony ?
the boy was bound naked on a rubber mat .
there were complicated incantations and stuff in latin and greek .
a pentacle was branded on his chest .
margaret handed johnny a virgin dagger and he sliced the boy clean open .
and he ate his heart .
he cut it out so quickly the heart was still beating when he wolfed it down .
johnny' s plan was to drop out and resurface as the soldier .
but before he could work things out , he was drafted .
then johnny was injured , sent home without even knowing who he was .
who was that boy ?
only johnny knew .
he sealed the dog tags in a vase and gave it to margaret .
it was margaret' s plan to drop him off in times square .
that would be the last place that he' d remember before it happened .
he needed a victim ... someone his own age ...
to steal their soul .
and he sliced the boy clean open and he ate his heart .
who was the boy ?
johnny' s plan was to drop out and resurface as the soldier .
or maybe he gained possession of the guy' s soul .
he still looked like johnny to me .
oh , shit !
no !
i know who i am !
i know who i am !
alas .
how terrible is wisdom when it brings no profit to the wise , johnny .
louis cyphre .
lucifer .
even your name is a dime store joke .
mephistopheles is such a mouthful in manhattan , johnny .
you think posing as the devil ... just ' cause it scared some superstitious old guitar player ... and that witch and that nutty old man ...
you think it' s gonna scare me ?
it ain' t , ' cause i know who i am .
and you killed them , and you' re tryin ' to pin it on me .
and i know who i am .
if i had cloven hoofs and a pointed tail , would you be more convinced ?
you' re crazy .
i know who i am .
you' re trying to frame me .
you' re trying to frame me .
cyphre , i know who i am .
you murdered them people .
i never killed nobody .
i didn' t kill fowler ... and ... and i didn' t kill toots ... and i didn' t kill margaret and i didn' t kill krusemark .
i didn' t kill no one .
i' m afraid you did , johnny .
my name' s not johnny .
all killed by your own hand .
guided by me , naturally .
frankly , you were doomed from the moment you slit that young boy in half .
and johnny ... for 12 years you' ve been living on borrowed time in another man' s memories .
hey , i' m gonna tell winesap , ' cause he knows .
winesap ?
well , he' s dead .
nasty accident .
don' t worry .
no one will mourn one less lawyer in the world .
there' s death everywhere these days , johnny .
but what gives human life its worth anyway ?
because someone loves it or hates it ?
the flesh is weak , johnny .
only the soul is immortal .
and yours belongs to me .
i know who i am .
that' s it , johnny .
take a good look .
however cleverly you sneak up on a mirror ... your reflection always looks you straight in the eye .
i know who i am !
well ...
girl of my dreams
i love you
honest , i do
you are so sweet
if i could just hold your charms
i know who i am !
again in my arms
then life would be
complete
since you' ve been gone , dear
life don' t seem the same
please come back
with me
and after all' s said and done
there' s only one
girl of my dreams
that' s you
why' d you come back ?
i live here .
who is she ?
she ain' t " angel , harold .
she' s my daughter .
bullshit .
who is she ?
she' s epiphany proudfoot .
she stayed here for a little while .
long enough for you to kill her , right ?
unless that ain' t your gun up her snatch .
you' re gonna burn for this , angel .
i know .
in hell .
