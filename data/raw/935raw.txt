i still got my flag .
i' m good .
i' m good .
oh , my peewee .
always moving so fast .
you move in together after a month ...
iive together for nine months , and nowyou' re engaged .
oh , i knowyou love him , butyou know ... sometimes it takes more than love ... to sustain a marriage .
you need to be old enough to know whoyou are ... and whatyou want and who he is .
oh , mom , mom , he' s wild and spontaneous ... and hysterical and offbeat ... and on top of all that ... he' s centered , and he' s down to earth .
he' s everything i want ... and we have this passion for each other ... that' s just ... oh !
i' m jealous .
ha ha ha !
all right . first thing tomorrow ... we' re gonna plan this wedding !
hey , you .
so i guess everyone thinks that we' re crazy ... for doing this .
now , when did we start caring about what other people think ? .
well , areyou sure that ... you don' t want to marry a guy like peter ? .
ifl wanted to know exactlywhat my life would be ... from here on out ...
i would marry a guy like peter .
but i love not knowing .
i love our messy loft .
your beater car .
ha ha .
i want to start a life with you .
sarah ?
go .
hi , daddy .
peewee ... marriage is like a business investment .
its its long term viability ... is best established unemotionally .
bottom line , daddy ? . we love each other .
that is all that matters , tsk .
leezak .
good night , sir .
congratulations , mr. leezak .
big daddy leezak' s in the house !
oh , i hope she doesn' t spook on you , man . what do you mean ? .
i love sarah .
don' t get me wrong , but ... rich chicks spook .
a powerful daddy plus family money ... equals expectations .
expectations are like a fungal rot on a marriage .
my marriage is not gonna have a fungal rot . we' re gonna be happily married every day ... for the rest of our lives .
unless she finds out that you slaughtered her dog .
oh , don' t worry .
i' il take that to my grave .
okay .
ifyou changeyour mind at the altar ... just pass out .
i' m not going to change my mind .
okay .
i' m just saying ifyou do ... just hit the floor .
thankyou , but it' s not gonna happen .
so , you' re sure you' re ready ... to give up your grazing rights ? .
i' m not a grazer , kyle . well , what ifyou became one later in life ? .
i mean , over the next 1 0 years ... you' re giving up five hayrides peryear .
so i can either be happily married to sarah ... or have 50 one night stands .
minimum .
that' s not even a choice .
okay , okay .
let' s move on .
are there any chicks you didn' t have ... thatyou wish you had ? .
you are , like , the worst best man ever .
hey , peter !
overhere , prentiss .
i can' t believe she invited prentiss .
glad you made it , buddy .
hey , man . what' s going on ? .
did she ever hook up with that yahoo ? .
theywent backpacking in europe once .
it was after high school .
i don' t think anything happened .
whoa .
you' re getting married ... and she didn' t share the roster ? .
she shared the roster .
merrick and bruce .
what about prentiss ? .
and you never asked again ? .
i won .
it' s irrelevant .
oh .
okay .
as long as you' re okay with a bogus roster .
it' s not a bogus roster .
is he on , or is he off ? .
he' s
shut up .
huh ? .
huh ? .
and you could' ve had peter .
i did have peter .

i drank way too much ... andbefore i knewit we ... tussled .
you bad girl .
i wanted to tell tom so many times ... but he gets so jealous , you know ? .
listen , it doesn' t matter that he doesn' t know .
it' s not like you guys were married ... and even ifyou were
no , no , no .

no reason .
does kyle know something that i should know ? .
no .
you covered your nose .
i had an itch .
you were hiding flared nostrils . what doyou have to tell ? .

it' s just ... when bags died ... he didn' t exactly die ... the way that i described it .
him chasing those squawking pigeons offthe balcony ? .

well
okay .
i' m reading my magazine ... and i' m really i' m focusing ... and i' m really into it ... and along comes bags , you know ? .

no , it was more like a lie ! where areyou going ? .
i have to figure out what to dowith this . what does that mean ? .
i can deal with you being cheap ... and i can deal with you being a shitty driver .
i cannot not deal with you being a liar ! whoa . wait a second .
