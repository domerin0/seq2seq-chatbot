my name is pacu ,
it' s a brand new name , so i' m not used to it yet ,
i' m trying to remember a story ,
sometimes i can , sometimes i get mixed up ,
because there' s another one stuck in my head ,
it' s about me , my brother , and a shirt in the wind ,
the blood is starting to turn yellow .
yah !
yah !
yah !
yah !
yah !
yah !
yah !
yah !
it' s pa who drives the oxen ' round the mill ,
in grandpa' s time , the slaves did all the work ,
now we do it .
tonio , my brother , crushes the sugarcane ,
ma gathers the scraps ,
bring more cane , kid .
hurry up !
let' s go , blocky !
turn , turn !
ma says god never gives us ... heavier burdens than we can bear ,
but god keeps messing up ,
he sometimes dumps such burdens on us , we all collapse ,
we live in stream of souls ,
it' s in the middle of nothing ,
all we know is it' s above the ground and below the sun ,
it' s so hot that it sets our hearts boiling ...
like a pot of molasses ,
tonio , i dreamed about incio again ,
go back to sleep now .
go on , kid .
and now , sleep .
go on , go on !
the blood has turned yellow .
tonio ... you know what you have to do .
don' t go , tonio .
your brother' s soul isn' t at rest .
he did what he had to do .
it' s tonio' s turn now .
don' t go .
listen to me , kid ,
your grandfather , your uncles , your oldest brother ... all died for this land and for our honor .
one day , it could be you .
you' re a breves ,
i , too , did my duty .
but it wasn' t god' s will that i die .
tonio , you' il leave at daybreak ,
and remember ... you' re only to seek out your brother' s killer .
man to man , face to face .
tonio will be walking over land that used to be ours ,
the ferreiras took it from us and we took it back ,
now it' s theirs again ,
that' s how the feud began ,
pa says it' s an eye for an eye ,
one of theirs for one of ours ... and so on , until everyone ended up blind ,
in the land of the blind ... one eyed people are said to be mad ,
mo ther , ; may god consent , may it be god' s will ,
may the soul of incio , my first born ... find peace alongside his own .
may each drop of his blood cost the enemy two .
may you , my son ... find the peace you never found among the living .
and watch over your brothers when their turn comes ,
we' re going for water .
yes , sir .
everything quiet ?
guard , ; yes , sir ,
like this .
go outside , kid .
for my brother !
i won' t pray for your grandson' s soul , since he killed my son .
but i respect your suffering .
it' s the same as mine .
today , ours is greater .
my son asks permission to attend the vigil ... to pray for the deceased' s soul .
afterwards , if you accept , he' d like to talk to you .
where is he ?
outside .
thank you .
good bye , my friend .
i prayed for the deceased .
i came to the wake and the burial .
now , i' d like to talk to you .
i request a truce .
grandfather , don' t accord a truce .
the truce is granted .
the same one your father granted to my grandson .
until the next moon .
from one death to the next .
this is your guarantee until the full moon .
after that , when the blood turns yellow , it will expire .
how old are you ?
twenty .
your life is now split in two .
the twenty years you' ve already lived ... and the short time you have left .
have you ever known love ?
you never will .
do you hear that clock ?
each time it ticks one more , one more , one more ... it will be telling you ... one less , one less , one less .
whoa .
good morning .
morning .
do you know of a little village ... near here called born sossago ?
it' s over there .
but it' s not little .
it' s not ?
what' s this place called ?
stream of souls .
so where' s the stream ?
dried up .
only the souls remain .
what is your name ?
kid .
what ?
i don' t have a name .
what do they call you ?
they just call me kid .
they call the kid " kid .
kid !
here , this is for you .
can you read ?
no .
but i can read pictures .
hey , kid !
stay away from those vagrants !
ma thinks the bloodstain will come out ,
but it won' t come out ,
you did your duty , my son ,
now you have much to do before the next moon .
crush the sugarcane and fix the roof ... in case it rains this year .
it never rains .
then the raw sugar has to be sold in the village .
that sounded like a bad dream , tonio ,
i tried to wake you up , but you didn' t want to ,
what are you doing up , kid ?
reading .
where' d you get that ?
a present .
from who ?
the girl gave it to me .
what girl ?
my friend , of course .
you went into town alone ?
no .
they were lost .
but not anymore .
i showed them the way .
hmm .
so what' s that book about ?
it' s about everything .
something' s wrong , kid .
what' s wrong ?
it' s upside down .
no , it' s not .
want to bet ?
it' s the same this way ... or that way .
no difference , see ?
you don' t know a thing about books .
give it to me .
it' s her !
tonlo , ; her ?
who ?
the girl who gave me the book .
she lives in the sea with the fish , the crabs , and the boats .
she' il take me with her .
she' il teach me the alphabet and all .
you don' t believe me ?
when i grow up , we' il get married .
has she been informed ?
no .
it' s still a secret .
one day ... the mermaid comes up to the surface .
and she saw the tree , the cows , the mountains , and grass .
when she looked at the top of the raw sugar house ... she saw the rooster with the mangy neck crowing for her .
ahh .
wow , she really liked that !
and she also saw the sugarcane , the mill ... everything delighted her !
but the best part of all was when she saw the kid .
are you still reading that book ?
can' t you see it will hurt your eyes ?
i' m trying to remember the story .
sometimes i can , sometimes i forget .
then just forget .
well ?
it is beginning to change color .
it won' t take long now .
no , it won' t .
you' re the most important merchant in town ... but with all due respect , this isn' t the right amount .
mr , loureno , ; no , it is the right amount ,
but i gave you the usual quantity .
steam power is bringing the price down .
it' s progress .
i think you should follow the example , mr. breves .
but mr. loureno , we had an agreement .
there is no shortage of raw sugar !
come on up !
come one , come all , if you want to watch ... the snake and the toad dance !
everyone will come .
together we will go .
tomorrow night , no one will sleep .
no man , no woman , no child .
come one , come all !
to the circus !
mr. loureno wants to decide other people' s suffering .
i saw her .
who ?
the mermaid .
up on stilts .
on what ?
she' s in the circus .
yeah ?
they' re bringing the circus to town ... with a fire eater , a clown ... and a snake that dances with a toad .

tonlo , ; no !

tonio ,
you have to go away .
did you see his black armband ?
yes .
he won' t be around much longer .
what are you talking about ?
it' s true .
it' s a family feud .
one side kills , then the other .
how do you know ?
it goes way back .
they' re fighting for the land .
they' d rather kill than solve their problems .
real fanatics .
it' s like the two snakes i saw fighting .
each was biting the tail of the other .
they ate each other up until nothing was left .
nothing but a pool of blood on the ground .
they' il all be killed off .
hmm .
i feel sorry for them .
i really do .
yah !
stay in line !
keep it going , slowpoke !
you' re lagging !
keep turning !
come on , blocky !

i can always use help .
especially if it' s free .
where' s my godson ?
at home .
come for the circus ?
heh !
you' il have to wait till next year .
we' re off to ventura for the festival .
ever been to ventura ?
no .
i haven' t been anywhere .
were you born dead or alive ?
what ?
were you born dead or alive ?
alive .
well , i was born dead .
true or false ?
true , i' m afraid .
ha ha !
let me explain .
my mother almost died giving birth .
i was born purple so purple they thought i was dead .
true or false ?
they ignored me for two hours while trying to save my mother .
then they decided to wash me so i' d look decent for the funeral .
as soon as i felt the cold water , i started howling .
as a result , that was my first and last bath .
no more baths !
nothing bothers me .
anyone born dead has been through the worst .
after that , life' s a breeze .
no kidding !
so when it comes to water ...
i don' t even use it for drinking !
ha ha ha !
yuck !
let' s go , bootleg !
how long do you have ?
not long .
i' il go as far as ventura , then i have to go back ,
salus tlana , ; clara ... where are you ?
in this house , the dead command the living .
sometimes i wish tonio wouldn' t come back .
don' t say that , woman .
even the worst life is better ... than being slaughtered like an animal .
look around you , woman .
what do we have left ?
nothing .
you see , we' ve already lost everything .
and if tonio doesn' t come back , we' il have lost our honor , too .
let' s go , bootleg !
come on , bootleg !
sleep well , young man ?
the mermaid coul dn' t live on land ... because she had a fish tail ... where her legs should be .
the poor thing couldn' t walk .
even so , one day she got furious and jumped out of the sea !
she started fighting with snakes and toads .
then , because she missed the kid so much ... she started puffing out fire and smoke .
so the kid got on a tired ol d ox ... and galloped after the mermaid ,
do dum , do dum , looking for the mermaid .
he went through the woods , the cane fields ... and when he parted the last row of sugarcane ... he came upon the sea .
and he found the mermaid .
following in your brother' s footsteps ?
think you can just take it easy around here ?
give me my book !
give it to me !
give me my book !
give it to me !
group , ; die , you rabid dog !
take that !
to hell with the traitor !
hah !
don' t tell me this shitty circus is still around ,
what did you say ?
you heard me ,
shit what ?

ha ha ha !
reginaldo .

spitting image of her mother .
reglnaldo , ; how she' s grown !

i' m going to show you something , tonio .

clara , ; start turning ,

neither will i , tonio .
clara !
yah !
yah !
yah !

yah !
whoa .
yah !
the shirt is almost yellow now .
it always turns yellow .
with your permission ...
i could get the men together ... and wipe those breves from the face of this earth ,
i' il repeat this one last time ,
blood has the same volume for everyone .
you have no right to take more than the blood taken from you .
otherwise , you' il pay twice in this life and in the next .
that' s what my father taught me and his father taught him .
and that' s how it' il be until i die .
i taught you how to fly with this , remember ?
you were scared shitless .
tonio , today it' s your turn .
huh ?
you take my place , i' il take yours .
no , i don' t want to .
just once .
ooh !
tonio !
tonio .
tonio .

tonio .
huh !
you' re too damn strong .
no , you just forgot how to fly .

ha ha !

but i' m not .
it' s turned yellow .

yes , it' s yellowed ,
you know what you have to do , then .
yes , i know .

it' s going to rain .
no , it' s not the rainy season .
i know it' s going to rain .
tonio ?

the kid coul dn' t find the mermaid ... no , it wasn' t like that ,

i think i' m remembering it !
one day , the mermaid came and took him to live with her ,
and he reall y liked that !
she turned the kid into a fish ... and took him to live in the east , at the sea ,
in the sea , everyone wasn' t dying all the time ,
there was a lot of room for everyone ,
in the sea , they lived so happil y ... so happil y , they coul dn' t stop laughing ,
