we like her more .
we want you to calm down , ok ?
calm down .
enjoy your flight .
hi .
welcome aboard .
right this way .
thank you .
guys .
excuse me .
ma' am ?
i' ve got two questions for you .
what are the movies ?
and how loud do these headphones go ?
never quite loud enough ?
i wish you guys would do that with bricks .
that way it would end faster .
those empty seats in the back are starting to look pretty attractive .
thank you .
guys , stop it .
hi , stephanie .
hey , bill .
could be some high maintenance in row 25 .
i heard ' em .
i think the people two planes away heard them .
tell the new kid it' s ok to laugh about the passengers .
it' s ok to hate the passengers .
they' ve just shut down frankfurt .
thank god we aren' t going to frankfurt .
we may not be going anywhere .
ladies and gentlemen , we apologize for the delay this evening .
we should be taking off shortly .
bob , what was that ?
i don' t know .
it' s nothing to worry about .
they have to nick the ice off or the air won' t pass over the wing properly .
you just sleep , honey .
and when you wake up , we' il be somewhere else .
we' il be in new york .
daddy , too ?
yeah .
daddy , too .
i love this part .
you ok ?
do you want me to get the steward ?
how' d you like a whole row to yourself ?
last couple of rows are empty .
we could take a few seats and we could stretch out .
would you like that ?
honey , i fell asleep .
are you watching this movie ?
no .
not too funny .
course at 36, 000ft you can' t just up and walk out of the theater .
did you see a little girl go by here ?
no , sure didn' t .
my daughter ...
how long have we been flying ?
three hours .
maybe a little more .
can i help you ?
i' m looking for my daughter .
there' s a girl in the lounge .
thank you .
no , she' s six , my daughter .
you probably saw us .
i was carrying her aboard .
of course .
yes .
she hasn' t been up here .
sorry .
excuse me .
i' m sorry .
she has sandy hair in a ponytail .
she' s probably carrying a chenille bear with one arm .
she probably just found a couple of kids to play with .
two bloody marys .
here you go , ma' am .
excuse me .
excuse me .
would you mind using the other aisle ?
i' m just looking for my daughter .
well , she can' t have gone too far .
fine , i' il go around .
your juice .
thank you .
pardon me .
shit .
is something wrong ?
i' m looking for my daughter .
have you seen her walking by or ...
i don' t think so .
how old is she ?
she' s six .
no , i never saw her .
can i help you , ma' am ?
ladies and gentlemen , i' m sorry to interrupt .
it seems our aircraft is big enough to lose a child in .
her name is julia pratt .
she' s six years old and wearing a navy blue jumper .
if she' s near you or playing with one of your kids , please press the call button .
we' ve got an anxious mom up here .
thank you .
all children should have to wear a cowbell .
someone must' ve seen her .
any takers ?
we' ve got to search the plane .
i don' t know how to organize that .
miss pratt , i am sure she' s perfectly ok .
no .
no , she' s not .
she' s been through something .
she' s not herself right now .
can we get the seat belt signs on ?
we' re getting ahead of ourselves .
there' s nine closets on this plane .
there' s four up and five down .
and nobody' s checked any of them .
there' s galleys , crew quarters .
there' s the holds .
kids can find places like that .
i just need the aisles clear so i can look , ok ?
ok .
i' m gonna have to ask you to go back to your seat .
but i tell you what .
i will personally go and speak to the captain and see if he can step away from the flight deck .
all right ?
are you in the airline business ?
you seem to know aircraft design .
yeah , i' m a propulsion engineer .
i work for elgin air .
i mean , i just left .
based in berlin ?
look , i know you' re just trying to keep me calm .
but the problem is not that i' m anxious .
the problem is my daughter is missing and nobody can tell me where she is .
i' m sorry .
do you have any kids ?
do nieces count ?
yeah , almost .
they hate playing hide and seek with me because i always find them .
so , fear not .
did you guys see my little girl ?
you' re the one they made the announcement about ?
i didn' t even know you had a kid with you .
did you ?
sorry , i didn' t .
maybe you could help me look for her .
cool .
awesome .
i' m so bored .
sorry , no .
why not ?
dad , she' s lost .
how lost can she be ?
we' re in a tube .
turn around .
i' m sure the captain will be here any minute .
excuse me .
i' il be right back .
engineer ?
yeah .
you the one who came up with the five across seating ?
miss pratt .
what' s wrong ?
who' s she talking to ?
we' il get to the bottom of this .
is she all right ?
did something happen to her ?
she' s hurt .
ok .
do you know where my daughter is ?
what aren' t you telling me ?
what aren' t you telling me ?
say it .
miss pratt , i' m sorry but i don' t think that she' s here .
what ?
we don' t ...
ma' am , we don' t have any record of your daughter ever having been on board .
what are you talking about ?
the departure gate say they never checked a julia pratt onto this plane .
of course they did .
she was right next to me .
we were the first two passengers on the plane .
we must have walked right past you .
ma' am , this is our passenger manifest .
your daughter isn' t on it .
we walked right past you .
row 26 .
i put her in the seat next to me , 26a .
the manifest lists 26a as unoccupied and i did the headcount myself .
so you missed one .
what does that have to do with finding her now ?
you want to see her boarding pass ?
if you wouldn' t mind .
i put it right in my pocket .
i put both boarding passes in my pocket .
her backpack' s missing .
she couldn' t have reached up there by herself .
she' s not tall enough .
somebody has her .
that' s quite an assumption .
how else could her stuff disappear ?
can you think of another way ?
i have to talk to the captain .
i can' t guarantee that he' il see you .
people do things to little girls .
sick things .
you know that .
i need to talk to the captain .
get back to your seat .
someone has my daughter .
captain , i need to speak to you .
you' re a threat to the safety of this aircraft .
i' m not a threat .
i' m an air marshal .
can i let you go ?
yes .
gene carson .
are you hurt ?
i just need to see the captain .
i understand .
but that' s his call , not yours .
all clear , captain .
the departure gate had no record of her ?
no , sir .
i had them double check .
and there' s no boarding pass .
there was but it was taken from me .
you were working the entry door , is that right ?
yes , captain .
did you see the girl ?
i don' t ...
i don' t remember either way , sir .
sir , i did the count myself .
26a was empty .
did you tell him about the bear ?
the bear ?
it was under her blanket .
she wouldn' t have walked away without it .
have you had anything to drink on this flight ?
anything alcoholic at all ?
no .
are you under any medication ?
i have sleeping pills with me just like every other passenger on board .
and i' m carrying klonopin .
for anxiety .
i took two this morning .
i see .
how long have you been on them ?
i' m not on them .
how long ?
i filled the prescription a week ago .
when my husband died .
my daughter and i are bringing his body back to long island for burial .
there is a casket in the hold , sir , from kaiser wilhelm hospital .
he fell six days ago from the roof of our building .
does anybody on board remember seeing her ?
passengers in her row ?
no one has said so , sir .
there are 32 children on the manifest .
they' ve all been accounted for .
you were seated near her , mr. carson .
isn' t that right ?
that' s right .
did you see her ?
no .
i didn' t .
think about what you' re suggesting , captain .
that i imagined bringing her on board and that i' m now pretending to look for her .
does that make any sense ?
can you think of a reason why i would do that ?
i' m not drunk , i' m not loaded , i' m not looking for attention .
there are protocols about these things .
if a pilot has an inaccurate passenger manifest , he must land the plane .
a teddy bear does not constitute an inaccurate passenger manifest .
i' m telling you it' s inaccurate .
that means you have to search the plane , just like you would if it was your own child that was missing .
julia' s only six years old .
she' s not in good shape right now .
she' s scared of everything .
i had to put her under my coat today just to get her in the car .
but she did get in that car .
she got on this plane like every other person here .
and i fell asleep .
which i should never have done .
but she was right next to me .
i was holding her hand when we took off .
please ...
you' ve got to help her .
get the lights up .
get every passenger seated .
no one in the toilets .
no exception .
look for her backpack , her boarding pass .
check every closet , every bin .
are there any more questions ?
thank you .
ladies and gentlemen , we apologize for the inconvenience but the captain requests that all passengers return to their seats .
we' il turn off the seat belt sign in a minute .
can you fasten that seat belt , please , ma' am ?
thank you .
i don' t see what all the fuss is about .
it' s not like she lost her palm pilot .
a six year old girl climbing into avionics ?
this is really silly .
this is procedure .
captain .
thanks .
anybody in here ?
hello ?
miss ?
miss .
i need to use the rest room .
as soon as the captain' s turned off the seat belt sign , sir .
i don' t need an escort .
i' m responsible for any threat
to the safety of this flight .
this is absurd .
women with imaginary children qualify .
sir , you' il have to return to your seat .
my back gets stiff ...
i' m sorry .
all passengers must remain in their seats .
i know .
running out of magazines up here .
tell me something .
what are you gonna do when we find her ?
how are you gonna explain yourself ?
it' s not so bad if she' s lost .
because then you just look lazy .
but if somebody took her , if a crime was committed on this flight , and the law enforcement official on board didn' t do anything about it , how' s that gonna look ?
you made your point .
katerina .
what ?
have a look .
why ?
did you see something ?
no .
it' s just that i' m dying to watch you crawl through that hatch .
what' s the problem ?
may i help you ?
do i know you from somewhere ?
you' ve walked past me five times since we took off .
does that count ?
are you from berlin ?
am i being interrogated now ?
i asked you if you' re from berlin .
no .
i am not .
let' s go .
what was that all about ?
think about what you' re saying no to .
it would be epic .
you' re terrible .
my daughter .
you were looking for my daughter .
i need to speak to the captain again .
can you get him on the phone for me , please ?
ok .
can we look in the holds now ?
there is no way a child could have gained access to any of the holds .
there' s access to the forward holds from galley number two .
the call button' s too high for ...
so was the overhead bin .
she' s with an adult .
i told you ...
what adult ?
every passenger is in his seat .
the passenger manifest is inaccurate .
you' ve got to search the holds now .
i' m sorry , miss pratt .
i' m afraid i can' t allow that .
excuse me .
godammit , are you listening ?
wait .
i don' t think it' s such a bad idea .
what ?
it might be good to have her below deck for a while .
she is making the passengers anxious .
obviously i would go down with her .
mr. carson , i am responsible for the safety of every passenger on this plane .
even the delusional ones and i will not have a passenger out of her seat bouncing around with the luggage bins in the holds .
any turbulence and you could be injured .
and so could you , mr. carson .
now , we' re going to continue to search this aircraft from the waist upwards .
if we don' t find anybody , i will send two members of my crew into the holds .
i just saw two members of your crew and they did everything except look for my daughter .
miss pratt , there are 425 passengers on this flight who are not receiving any attention at the moment because every one of my flight attendants are looking for a child that none of them believe was ever on board .
if you think we could be doing more to meet your needs , then i suggest you take it up with customer service after we land .
captain , can i speak to you for a moment ?
mr. carson , this woman is in your charge .
i want her to remain in the passenger cabin .
is that understood ?
understood .
do excuse me .
i know where i' ve seen him before .
i know where i' ve seen him before .
i know where i' ve seen you before .
what ?
where' s my daughter ?
you were looking through her window last night .
i saw you staring into my daughter' s room .
both of them .
you are a lunatic .
where' s julia ?
hold it .
back up .
have you seen these men before ?
yes .
no .
she has not .
i saw them last night staring into my daughter' s room .
is this correct , sir ?
i' ve never seen this woman before .
neither have l .
what do you expect them to say , " you got me " ?
shouldn' t we move this to a galley ?
why ?
i didn' t do anything .
i' ve never even seen this woman before .
where' d you take my little girl ?
aren' t you listening ?
i have never seen her .
i don' t trust ' em .
not that it' s any of your concern , but i was at the hilton last night on business .
we both were .
and neither of us left the hotel .
would you like to see our bill ?
it' s a bit unorthodox but ... ... if you wouldn' t mind .
when i travel with my children , i have an eye on them at all times .
i don' t lose them and blame somebody else .
satisfied ?
a bill doesn' t prove anything .
satisfied ?
are you gonna let him talk to you like that ?
let' s go .
where' s my daughter ?
i spent the night watching a movie , you crazy ...
come here .
where' s my daughter ?
get a handle on this lady , will ya ?
it' s ok .
i' m ok .
is that the lady with the kid ?
anyone else have any questions for me ?
then you' il have to find a few other arabs to harass .
sonofabitch .
we' re gonna take our seats now .
all of us .
right ?
i can cuff you , understand that ?
why would you want to cuff me ?
sorry .
got a seventy year old who couldn' t hold his pee any longer .
mine' s six , almost wet himself .
ok .
you think those men were surveilling you last night for the purposes of kidnapping your daughter
and stashing her until we land ?
yes .
mind if i ask you an obvious question ?
if they knew where you lived , why not take her from there ?
why take her on an airplane with no means of escape ?
i don' t know .
and let' s not forget , her name isn' t on the manifest .
how could two passengers pull that off ?
they' d have to have somebody from the crew involved .
jesus .
think about what you' re asking me to do .
approach two arabs on an airplane and accuse them of criminal conspiracy .
i don' t give a shit about being politically incorrect .
fine , let' s arrest them , just as soon as you answer one more question .
why would anyone want to take your daughter ?
what makes her so special ?
what makes you so special ?
i know the plane .
that' s what this is all about .
why they picked me .
they picked you ?
for what ?
i think they' re hijacking the plane .
i think my daughter' s a hostage .
your husband' s death is starting to make a lot more sense to me .
a couple more hours and even i' m ready to jump .
he fell .
david fell .
sure he did .
ladies and gentlemen , the captain' s turned off the seat belt sign .
you are now free to ...
what' s he doing ?
what' s he doing ?
excuse me .
what are you doing ?
are we done looking ?
just come with me .
i' m not going anywhere .
we' re not going to discuss this here .
where' s my daughter ?
where is she ?
she' s dead , godammit .
you found her .
no , i didn' t find her , miss pratt .
this is from kaiser wilhelm hospital .
that' s where your husband was pronounced dead .
is that correct ?
yes .
your daughter was also taken there .
no .
she wasn' t there when it happened .
she was with the nanny .
miss pratt , according to the director at the morgue there your daughter julia died of internal injuries at 2 . 36pm .
he took her with him off the roof .
didn' t he ?
no .
julia wasn' t even there .
she was at the park .
she was at the park .
she wasn' t even there .
she wasn' t even there .
you' re crazy .
you' re all crazy .
she was never on board .
no .
i carried her on board .
miss pratt , i can' t tell you how sorry i am .
she must be so scared .
but my main responsibility is the safety of these passengers and i can' t allow anyone , no matter how tragic their circumstances ,
to jeopardize that .
she doesn' t know where she is .
our air marshal is going to escort you back to your seat .
mr. carson , would you take her back to her seat now ?
what' s she doing ?
stop her .
grab her .
how are you feeling ?
are you in pain ?
we can get you some aspirin if you want .
kids , turn around .
turn around .
turn around .
the captain thought you might want to talk with me .
i' m a therapist .
my seat' s just a few rows up .
and i asked if i might be able to help .
i don' t know you .
so many of my patients come to me after a loss .
to grieve .
sometimes it' s just stopping .
allowing the pain to come .
your husband , david ... ... can you tell me about him ?
i don' t know you .
was he very unhappy ?
yes .
he was unhappy .
i didn' t know .
he didn' t talk about it like that .
i understand .
last night i walked through the city and he was with me .
he was there .
was julia there , too ?
no .
she was waiting for me at home .
she was happy to see you ?
she said she couldn' t sleep .
so i got into bed with her .
and lay there until she closed her eyes .
when something' s too overwhelming , too painful , we deny it .
we choose to believe something else .
so you can walk with david and get on a plane with julia .
it feels better than the truth .
so much better .
yes , of course .
but it' s impossible to move on if we haven' t accepted , if we haven' t grieved .
sometimes it helps to think of an image .
you could imagine your husband and daughter on an island .
a beautiful place .
they' il always be there .
and you can swim to them any time you need to .
do you understand ?
am i allowed to go to the rest room ?
i just need to be alone .
i don' t know where else to go .
this is a very good idea .
she needs a moment on her own .
is she any kind of threat to herself ?
no .
of course not .
should we take her belt and shoelaces ?
no , she' s going to be fine .
she' s going to be fine .
aren' t you ?
you' re going to be fine .
excuse me .
pardon me .
excuse me .
sure .
i' il be waiting right here .
i' il be right out .
all right , place the mask over your nose and mouth .
breathe normally .
they' re tangled up .
sir , please take your seat .
i don' t wanna die .
attention .
there is no need to panic .
place the mask over your nose and mouth and use the straps to tighten it .
stay calm .
no way .
ok .
stay back in your seat .
stay in your seat , ma' am .
thank you .
what did you do to the lights ?
get your hands off me .
where is she ?
you don' t need a mask .
we haven' t lost pressure .
where is she ?
julia ?
julia ?
are you in there ?
i' m right here , baby .
hold on .
just wait .
mommy' s here , baby .
no ...
david ...
honey ...
i' m so scared , honey .
i can' t find her .
i can' t find our baby .
i don' t know where she is .
but no one will help me .
no one can help me .
they didn' t even see her .
turn around .
don' t ...
i' m not done looking yet .
yeah , you are .
let' s go .
what' s he doing ?
there' s two hours left .
we' re descending .
that' s what pilots do when there' s an out of control passenger on board .
fine .
the sooner we land , the sooner we can clear the airplane and i can keep searching .
i haven' t checked in the attics yet .
they' ve already been searched .
i haven' t searched them .
ladies and gentlemen , we have begun to descend now .
we are going to be making an unscheduled stop ...
we' d like to apologize for any delay .
what' s happening ?
i don' t know .
here she comes .
how come there' s only one coffin down there ?
if my daughter had died with my husband , i' d be flying two coffins home .
wouldn' t l ?
you know what ?
i don' t know ... and i don' t care .
you just scared the shit out of 400 passengers who didn' t plan to spend the night in newfoundland .
my daughter' s alive .
you know she' s alive .
you know she' s on this plane .
why didn' t anybody see her ?
please .
there' s not that many places left to search .
i just need the plane deboarded when we land .
you' re gonna be arrested when we land .
gonna hold onto her this time ?
about time .
if you let them arrest me , she' s gone for ever .
there' il be no one to save her .
please ...
i' m begging you .
ma' am .
sir .
i need to talk to the captain .
can you sit here ?
we' re descending .
all passengers ...
i' m sorry .
it' s a security matter .
she won' t be any trouble .
are you hurt ?
no .
did you eat anything ?
what part of the plane did you search ?
i' m sorry ?
when we had the crew search for my daughter ?
where were you ?
i' m very sorry for your loss , ma' am .
what does she want ? $50 million .
transferred into that account .
or they blow up the plane .
they ?
she has an accomplice on board .
she won' t say who it is .
but ... that' s who' s holding the detonator .
the plane' s to be deboarded on the tarmac , passengers first , then crew .
and they want a g3 .
fuelled and waiting .
so all that searching for the girl was just a ...
she' s disturbed .
she used her husband' s coffin to get explosives on board .
and as for the little girl , i don' t know .
maybe she killed them both .
i want to speak to her .
she doesn' t want that .
no approaches by any member of the crew .
now , listen .
listen .
i don' t get the feeling she wants to hurt anyone .
i' ve never heard of a hijacker letting passengers deboard before .
my recommendation is you ask the airline to wire the money , notify me when the transfer' s been made .
ok ?
let' s keep her thinking she' s in control .
we' il land , get everyone deboarded , then we take her down .
mr. carson ?
what are you doing ?
i am not sitting back there .
gene , she knows .
what does she know ?
she knows the kid' s in avionics , she knows that i' m a part of this .
did she say anything about avionics ?
no .
did you ?
no .
then why are you panicking ?
everything' s working out how we wanted it to .
she has half the plane believing we have arab terrorists on board .
it' s priceless .
she' s putting things together , gene .
what difference does it make ?
she' il be dead ten minutes after we land .
they' il find her with a bullet hole through her head .
and a detonator in her hand .
hasn' t this all been explained to you a thousand times ?
the only piece of evidence that matters is about this high .
her name is julia and she is gonna get vaporized .
now it is all working .
get it together .
ok , look .
if something goes wrong when we land ...
mr. carson ?
the captain would like you to call him .
thank you .
yes , captain .
the money' s been wired .
i have confirmation .
do you have a pen ?
i do .
go ahead .
ladies and gentlemen , the captain has turned on the seat belt sign as we prepare for our final descent .
please return your seat to its upright position .
thank you .
i can handle it from here .
i don' t understand .
cuffs are for people who pose a threat .
right ?
we' re putting down in goose bay , newfoundland .
the f. b. i. ' s en route .
i' ve notified them that we have a missing person situation .
they' il clear the plane and every passenger on board will be detained and questioned .
two agents will come on board and help us look for her .
what about the crew ?
will they be detained and questioned ?
you' ve no idea how happy i' m gonna be to hand this case over .
thank you .
where the hell are we ?
sit back .
all units , the suspect will be escorted off the plane by a flight marshal .
confirm .
victor one standing by to provide transport .
just keep quiet .
you don' t want to antagonize anybody .
these people already expect you to be arrested by now .
t ouch me again , you' re dead .
touch .
go .
move .
shut up .
ok .
the crew' s gonna deboard now .
another couple of minutes , the plane will be all yours .
where are you going ?
i need to talk to him .
make sure nothing gets taken off the plane .
no food carts , no trash cans .
it' s important the plane stays sealed .
well , i don' t really have the option to say no .
do l ?
ok , let' s sit down .
captain .
all set for deboarding ?
captain , look .
i know i broke the law and disrupted your flight .
but in a few minutes , we' il find my daughter ...
the crew can deboard now .
and you' re gonna owe her an apology .
enough .
miss pratt , your money has been wired just as you asked .
a g3 is waiting , just as you asked .
perhaps we can do without the pretense of the missing child now .
what ?
wait here .
i' il get them .
get who ?
the agents .
wait here .
subject is zero 50 meters .
carson .
you get off the plane when i say you get off the plane .
you want to play ?
let' s play .
i want my daughter .
deboard the crew and we' il talk about it .
or you can go back there and tell them i' m the hijacker .
and maybe they' il believe you .
maybe i' il tell them what you' ve got in your pocket .
go ahead .
the first one to go will be your daughter .
will that be all ?
no .
give him your gun .
god speed , mr. carson .
thank you , captain .
i think you and i need to talk .
me , too .
where is she ?
where' d you put her ?
she' s in avionics , isn' t she ?
isn' t she ?
stay here .
listen , it' s over .
nobody is coming to help you .
you' re the crazy lady .
so why don' t you just come out of there ?
nobody has to die .
my husband didn' t jump off that building .
he didn' t fall off it either .
you' re taking things too personally .
we needed a coffin because they aren' t x rayed .
we needed a credible hijacker who knew the plane .
those are the breaks .
you really wanna kill a little girl ?
he wouldn' t mind .
i know that .
the harder this gets , the more he seems to enjoy himself .
but what about you ?
what about you ?
you wanna kill my little girl ?
is that our suspect ?
negative on that .
that is not our suspect .
julia ...
honey , can you hear me ?
god , what did they do to you ?
ok .
your husband didn' t fall off the roof .
he flew off .
come on .
come on out .
nobody' s coming for you .
you know why ?
because nobody cares .
people will think what i tell them to think .
that' s how authority works .
we picked her up , shoved her into a food bin and nobody even looked up .
you understand what i' m saying ?
nobody cares about julia .
all right , it' s over .
let' s finish it .
all right .
we' il be safe back here , honey .
what are you gonna do ?
you gonna blow us up ?
no .
just you .
good lord , she did it .
dispatch , this is f. b. i. ground one .
all units back to the outer markers .
evac transport three switching to secure three .
my god , she' s ...
what is she holding ?
she' s holding her daughter .
her daughter .
let' s go , people .

she looks like you .
yeah .
yeah , there' s a bit of her dad in there , too .
