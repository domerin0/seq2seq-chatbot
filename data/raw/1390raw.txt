aah !
aah !
mahtim !
mahtim !
mahtim !
good afternoon , gentlemen .
first off , i' d like to thank this board ... for taking the time to hear my proposal .
now , we' ve all heard of the legend of atlantis ... a continent somewhere in the mid atlantic ... that was home to an advanced civilization ... possessing technology far beyond our own ... that , according to our friend plato here ... was suddenly struck by some cataclysmic event ... that sank it beneath the sea .
now , some of you may ask , why atlantis ?
it' s just a myth , isn' t it ?
pure fantasy .
well , that is where you' d be wrong .
1 0, 000 years before the egyptians ... built the pyramids ...
atlantis had electricity , advanced medicine ... even the power of flight .
impossible , you say ?
well , no .
no , not for them .
numerous ancient cultures all over the globe agree ... that atlantis possessed a power source of some kind ... more powerful than steam , than than coal .
more powerful than our modern ... internal combustion engines .
gentlemen , i propose that we find atlantis ... find that power source ... and bring it back to the surface .
now , this is a page from an illuminated text ... that describes a book called the shepherd' s journal ... said to have been a first hand account ... of atlantis and its exact whereabouts .
now , based on a centuries old translation of a norse text ... historians have believed the journal resides in ireland .
but after comparing the text ... to the runes on this viking shield ...
i found that one of the letters ... had been mistranslated .
so , by changing this letter ... and inserting the correct one ... we find that the shepherd' s journal ... the key to atlantis ...
lies not in ireland , gentlemen ... but in iceland .
uhh !
pause for effect .
gentlemen , uh , i' il take your questions now .
uh , would you gentlemen please excuse me for a moment ?
cartography and linguistics , milo thatch speaking .
yeah .
uh , just just a second .
pardon me , mr. hickenbottom .
how' s that ?
is that better ?
uh huh .
yeah .
you' re welcome .
and don' t let it happen again !
all right , bye .
now , as you can see by th by this , um , map map , uh , that that ahem that i' ve drawn , i plotted the route ... that will take myself and a crew ... to the southern coast of iceland to retrieve the journal .
ah , showtime .
well , this is it .
i am finally getting out of the dungeon .
dear mr. thatch , this is to inform you ...
that your meeting today has been moved up ...
from 4 : 30 p. m. to 3 : 30 p. m.
what ?
dear mr. thatch , due to your absence ....
the board has voted to reject your proposal .
have a nice weekend .
mr. harcourt' s office .
they can' t do this to me !
i swear , that young thatch ... gets crazier every year .
if i ever hear the word " atlantis " again ...
i' il step in front of a bus !
ha ha ha !
i' il push you !
mr. harcourt !
good lord !
there he is !
members of the board uh , wait !
how did you find us ?
mr. harcourt , wait !
head for the hills !
where is a guard when you need him ?
mr. harcourt , you gotta listen to me , sir !
uh , sir ?
wait !
mr. harcourt !
sir , i i have new evidence that please , mr. harcourt !
stop !
sir , if you could you hold
thank you very much .
look at
this museum funds scientific expeditions ... based on facts , not legends and folklore .
besides , we need you here .
we depend on you .
you do ?
yes !
what with winter coming ... that boiler' s going to need a lot of attention .
boiler ?
onward , heinz !
but there there' s a journal !
it' s in iceland !
i' m sure of it this time !
sir , i really hoped it wouldn' t come to this ... but this is uhh a letter of resignation .
if you reject my proposal , i' il whoa !
i' il quit !
i mean it , sir .
if you refuse to fund my proposal
you' il what ?
flush your career down the toilet ... just like your grandfather ?
you have a lot of potential , milo .
don' t throw it all away chasing fairy tales .
but i can prove atlantis exists !
you want to go on an expedition ?
here .
take a trolley to the potomac and jump in !
maybe the cold water will clear your head .
heinz !
i' m home .
fluffy ?
here , kitty .
milo james thatch ?
who who are you ?
how did you get in here ?
i came down the chimney .
ho , ho , ho .
my name is helga sinclair .
i' m acting on behalf of my employer ... who has a most intriguing proposition for you .
are you interested ?
your your your employer ?
heh .
who is your employer ?
this way , please .
and don' t drip on the caravaggio .
step lively .
mr. whitmore does not like to be kept waiting .
you will address him as " mr. whitmore " or " sir .
you will stand unless asked to be seated .
keep your sentences short and to the point .
are we clear ?
and relax .
he doesn' t bite ... often .
grandpa ?
finest explorer i ever met .
preston whitmore .
pleasure to meet you , milo .
join me in a little yoga ?
uh , no , no .
thank you .
did you really know my grandfather ?
oh , yeah .
met old thaddeus back in georgetown .
class of ' 66 .
we stayed close friends ... till the end of his days .
even dragged me along ... on some of his danged fool expeditions .
thatch was crazy as a fruit bat , he was .
he spoke of you often .
funny .
he he never mentioned you .
oh , he wouldn' t .
he knew how much i liked my privacy .
i keep a low profile .
mr. whitmore , should i be wondering why i' m here ?
look on that table .
ah !
it' s for you .
it' s it' s from my grandfather .
he brought that package to me years ago .
he said if anything were to happen to him ...
i should give it to you ... when you were ready whatever that means .
milo : lt
it can' t be .
it' s the shepherd' s journal .
mr. whitmore , this journal is the key ... to finding the lost continent of atlantis !
atlantis !
ha ha ha !
i wasn' t born yesterday , son .
no , no , no .
look look at this .
coordinates .
clues .
it' s all right here .
yeah , looks like gibberish to me .
that' s because it' s been written in a dialect ... that no longer exists .
so it' s useless .
no , no , just difficult .
i' ve spent my whole life studying dead languages .
it' s not gibberish to me .
ah , it' s probably a fake .
mr. whitmore , my grandfather would have known ... if this were a fake .
i would know .
i will stake everything i own , everything that i believe in ... that this is the genuine shepherd' s journal .
all right , all right .
so what do you want to do with it ?
well , i' il i' il i' il get funding .
i mean , i' il the museum
they' il never believe you .
i' il show them !
i will make them believe .
like you did today ?
yes !
well , no .
how did you ...
forget about them , ok ?
never mind !
i will find atlantis on my own .
i mean , if i have to rent a rowboat !
congratulations , milo .
this is exactly what i wanted to hear .
but forget the rowboat , son .
we' il travel in style .
it' s all been arranged , the whole ball of wax .
why ?
for years your granddad bent my ear ... with stories about that old book .
i didn' t buy it for a minute .
so finally i got fed up ... and made a bet with the old coot .
i said , " thatch , if you ever actually find ...
that so called journal ...
not only will i finance the expedition ...
but i' il kiss you full on the mouth .
imagine my embarrassment ... when he found the darn thing .
now i know your grandfather' s gone , milo ...
god rest his soul , but preston whitmore ... is a man who keeps his word .
you hear that , thatch ?
i' m going to the afterlife ... with a clear conscience , by thunder !
your grandpa was a great man .
you probably don' t realize how great .
those buffoons at the museum dragged him down ... made a laughingstock of him .
he died a broken man .
if i could bring back just one shred of proof ... that' d be enough for me .
ah , thatch .
what are we standing around for ?
we got work to do .
but , mr. whitmore , you know , in order to do ... what you' re proposing , you' re gonna need a crew .
taken care of !
you' il need engineers and and geologists .
got ' em all .
the best of the best .
gaetan moliere , geology and excavation .
the man has a nose for dirt .
vincenzo santorini , demolitions .
busted him out of a turkish prison .
audrey ramirez .
don' t let her age fool you .
she' s forgotten more about engines ... than you or i will ever know .
they' re the same crew that brought the journal back .
where was it ?
iceland .
i knew it !
i knew it !
all we need now is an expert in gibberish .
so it' s decision time .
you can build on the foundation your grandfather left you ... or you can go back to your boiler room .
this is for real .
now you' re catching on .
all right .
ok .
i i i' il have to quit my job .
it' s done .

yep .
don' t like to leave loose ends .

your granddad had a saying .
our lives are remembered ... by the gifts we leave our children .
this journal is his gift to you , milo .
atlantis is waiting .
what do you say ?
i' m your man , mr. whitmore .
you will not regret this .

and he says to me oh .
hold on a second , margie , i got another call .
sir , we' re approaching coordinates .
hello , margie ?
yeah , so anyways , he says ...
all right , let' s have a look around .
aye , sir .
set course to 2 4 0 .
15 degrees down angle on the bow planes .
come right 2 4 0 .
welcome to the bridge , mr. thatch .
ok , everybody ...
i want you to give mr. thatch ... your undivided attention .
good afternoon .
can everyone hear me ok ?
heh , ok , uh , how how ' bout some slides ?
the the first slide is a depiction of a creature .
a creature so frightening ... that sailors were said to be driven mad ... by the mere sight of it .
hubba , hubba .
uh , i' m sorry .
that' s ... wrong .
geez , i used to take lunch money ... from guys like this .
anyway , this , uh ok .
this is an illustration of the leviathan ... the creature guarding the entrance to atlantis .
with something like that ...
i would have white wine , i think .
it' s a mythical sea serpent .
he' s described in the book of job .
the the bible says ...
out of his mouth go burning lights ... sparks of fire shoot out .
but more likely it' s a carving or a sculpture ... to frighten the superstitious .
so we find this masterpiece .
then what ?
when do we dig ?
actually , we don' t have to dig .
you see , according to the journal ... the path to atlantis will take us down a tunnel ... at the bottom of the ocean , and we' il come up a curve ... into an air pocket right here ... where we' il find the remnants ... of an ancient highway that will lead us to atlantis .
kind of like the grease trap in your sink .
cartographer , linguist , plumber .
hard to believe he' s still single .
you said there' d be digging .
go away , mole .
captain , you' d better come look at this , sir .
ok , class dismissed .
give me exterior lights .
look at that .
there are ships here from every era .
commander , i think you should hear this .
predeshtem logtu nug ... nah geb .
commander ?
commander ?
enter the lair of the leviathan .
commander ?
there you will find the path to the gateway .
commander ?
yes , mrs. packard .
what is it ?
i' m picking up something on the hydrophone ...
i think you should hear .
put it on speakers .
what is it ?
a pod of whales ?
uh uh .
bigger .
it sounds metallic .
could be an echo off one of the rocks .
do you want to do my job ?
be my guest .
is it just me , or is that getting louder ?
well , whatever it was , it' s gone now .
helmsman !
bring us about .
tighten our search pattern and slow us to
out of the way !
tell cookie to melt the butter ... and break out the bibs .
i want this lobster served up on a silver platter .
load the torpedo bays !
subpod crews , battle stations !
battle stations !
steady , boys .
don' t panic .
jiminy christmas !
it' s a machine !
wait , wait !
uhh !
launch subpods !
subpods away !
fire !
we' re free .
all ahead full .
fire torpedoes !
fire torpedoes !
get me the bridge !
sir , it' s engineering on four .
rourke !
we took a big hit down here ... and we' re taking on water fast .
i don' t want to be around when it hits the boilers .
how much time do we have ?
20 minutes , if the bulkhead holds .
you better make that five .
you heard the lady .
let' s move !
move !
where ?
move where ?
packard , sound the alarm !
he took his suitcase ?
marge , honey , i don' t think he' s comin ' back .
packard !
i have to call you back .
no , no , i' il call you .
all hands , abandon ship .
move it , people !
sometime today would be nice !
come on !
everybody grab a seat and buckle in .
lieutenant , get us out of here !
lieutenant !
i' m working on it !
hang on .
where to , mr. thatch ?
we' re looking for a big crevice of some kind .
there !
up ahead .
all craft , make your mark 20 degrees down angle .
roger !
20 degrees down angle .
right behind you !
sacre bleu !
we' re getting killed out here !
look out !
it' s only a grease trap .
it' s just like a sink .
it' s only a grease trap .
it' s just like a sink !
seven hours ago , we started this expedition ... with 200 of the finest men and women i' ve ever known .
we' re all that' s left .
i won' t sugar coat it , gentlemen .
we have a crisis on our hands .
but we' ve been up this particular creek before ... and we' ve always come through , paddle or no paddle .
i see no reason to change that policy now .
from here on in , everyone pulls double duty .
everyone drives , everyone works .
looks like all our chances for survival ... rest with you , mr. thatch .
you and that little book .
we' re all gonna die .
ok , people .
saddle up .
lieutenant , i want this convoy moving five minutes ago .
moliere , you' re on point .
no , vinney , audrey' s taking the oiler .
you know the rules .
i want you 50 yards ... behind that truck at all times .
and , packard , put out that cigarette .
are you sure you' re checked out on this class of vehicle ?
uhh ...
can you drive a truck ?
pfft !
heh heh .
of course i can drive a truck .
i mean , sure , you got your steering ... and your gas and your brake ... and , of course , this metal , uh , looking ... thing .
ok , so it was a bumper car at coney island ... but it' s the same basic principle !
come on !
sorry abou sorry about that .
come on , civilian !
oof .
ahh .
you didn' t just drink that , did you ?
mm hmm .
that' s not good .
that' s nitroglycerin .
don' t move .
eh , don' t breathe .
don' t do anything , except pray maybe .
boom !
aah !
yeah .
good night !
will you look at the size of this !
it' s gotta be half a mile high at least .
it it must have taken hundred no , pfft , thousands of years to carve this thing .
hey , look , i made a bridge .
it only took me , like , what ?
1 0 seconds , 1 1 , tops .
looks like we have a little roadblock .
vinny , what do you think ?
i could unroadblock that if i had about 200 of these .
problem is i only got about ... 1 0 .
plus , you know , five of my own ... and a couple of cherry bombs ... a road flare .
hey , too bad we don' t have some nitroglycerin , eh , milo ?
looks like we' re gonna have to dig .
it will be my pleasure .
aah !
oh !
stupid !
you are stupid !
i don' t understand it .
i just tuned this thing up this morning .
um ...
it looks like the rotor' s shot !
i' m gonna have to pull a spare ... from one of the trucks .
can i  no toques nada !
i' il be right back .
she lives !
hey , what' d you do ?
well , you know , the boiler in this baby ... is a humac model p54/ 81 3 .
now we got the 81 4 back at the museum .
the heating cores on the whole humac line ... have always been a little , you know , temperamental ... so sometimes you gotta ... boom !
persuade ' em a little .
yeah , yeah , thank you very much .
shut up .
two for flinching .
ooh !
this is it .
it' s gotta be .
all right , we' il make camp here .
why is it glowing ?
pah !
it is a natural phosphorescence .
that thing is going to keep me up all night , i know it .
come and get it !
for the appetizer , caesar salad ... escargot ... and your oriental spring rolls .
yuck .
i wanted the escargot .
knock yourself out .
there you go , milo .
put some meat on them bones .
thanks , cookie .
that looks greasier than usual .
you like it ?
well , have some more .
you' re so skinny , if you turned sideways ... and stuck out your tongue you' d look like a zipper .
you know , we' ve been pretty tough on the kid .
what do you say we cut him some slack ?
yeah , you' re right .
hey , milo !
why don' t you come sit with us ?
really ?
you don' t mind ?
nah .
park it here .
gee , this is great .
i mean , you know ... it' s an honor to be included in your
mole !
ah , forgive me .
i could not resist .
hey , milo , don' t you ever close that book ?
yeah , you must' ve read it a dozen times by now .
i know , but this this doesn' t make any sense .
see , in this passage here , the shepherd ... seems to be leading up to something .
he calls it the heart of atlantis .
it could be the power source the legends refer to .
but then it just it cuts off .
it' s almost like there' s a missing page .
kid , relax .
we don' t get paid overtime .
i know , i know .
sometimes i get a little carried away .
but , hey , you know , that' s what this is all about , right ?
i mean , discovery , teamwork , adventure .
unless , maybe ... you' re just in it for the money .
money .
money .
money .
money .
i' m gonna say ... money .
well , i guess i set myself up for that one .
what , is something wrong with your neck ?
oh , yeah , i must' ve hurt it when
aah !
ow !
better ?
yeah !
hey , how' d you learn how to do that ?
an arapaho medicine man .
get outta here .
born and raised with ' em .
my father was an army medic .
he settled down in the kansas territory ... after he met my mother .
no kidding .
nope .
i got a sheepskin from howard u. and a bearskin from old iron cloud .
halfway through medical school , i was drafted .
one day i' m studying gross anatomy in the classroom ... the next i' m sewing up rough riders on san juan hill .
main course .
i couldn' t eat another bite .
i' m watching my weight .
ha ha ha , don' t you worry .
it' il keep and keep and keep .
thank god i lost my sense of taste years ago .
aren' t you going to pitch up your tent ?
uh , i did .
i guess i' m still a little rusty at this .
i haven' t gone camping since ... well , the last time my grandpa took me .
i never got to meet your grandfather .
what was he like ?
where do you start ?
he was like a father to me , really .
my parents died when i was a little kid ... and he took me in .
what ?
well , i was just thinkin ' .
one time , when i was eight , we were hiking along this stream ... and i saw something shining in the water .
it was a genuine arrowhead .
well , you' d think i' d found a lost civilization ... the way grandpa carried on about it .
it wasn' t until i was older ... that i realized that the arrowhead ... was just some compressed shale ... mixed with zinc pyrite that had fractured ... into an isosceletic triangulate .
that is so cute !
say , audrey , uh , no no offense ... but how does a teenager become the chief mechanic ... of a multimillion dollar expedition ?
well , i took this job when my dad retired .
but the funny thing was ... he always wanted sons , right ?
one to run his machine shop and the other ... to be middleweight boxing champion .
but he got my sister and me instead .
so , what what happened to your sister ?
she' s 24 and 0 , with a shot at the title next month .
anyway , i' m saving up ... so my pap and i can open another shop .
forget your jammies , mrs. packard ?
i sleep in the nude .
you' re gonna want a pair of these .
she sleepwalks .
well , as far as me goes ...
i just like to blow things up .
come on , vinny ... tell the kid the truth .
my family owned a flower shop .
we would sell roses ... carnations , baby' s breath , you name it .
one day , i' m making ... about three dozen corsages for this prom .
you know , the one they put on their wrist .
and everybody , they come .
where is it ?
when is it ?
does it match my dress ?
it' s a nightmare .
anyway , i guess there was this leak next door ... of gas or what .
boom !
no more chinese laundry .
blew me right through the front window .
it was like a sign from god .
i found myself that boom .
what' s mole' s story ?
trust me on this one .
you don' t wanna know .
audrey , don' t tell him .
you shouldn' t have ... told me , but you did .
and now i' m telling you ... you don' t wanna know .
the redhead' s got a gun .
ahh , ooh .
ah !
aah !
holy whoa !
fire .
fire !
fire !
fire !
fire !
i' m gonna kill him .
thatch , go back to bed .
get some water on that fire !
no time !
get us into those caves !
move it !
move it !
move it !
ya ha !
gertie , pull !
milo , jump !
right now !
aah !
aah !
no , no , no , no , no , no , no !
whoa !
whoa !
aah !
aah !
all right , who' s not dead ?
sound off .
danged lightnin ' bugs ... done bit me on my sit upon .
somebody' s gonna have to suck out that poison .
now don' t everybody jump up at once .
audrey , give me a damage report .
not as bad as it could have been .
we totaled rigs two and seven ... but the digger looks like it' il still run .
lucky for us we landed in something soft .
pumice ash .
we are standing ... at the base of a dormant volcano .
it just keeps going .
maybe that' s our ticket outta here .
maybe not .
the magma has solidified in the bowels of the volcano ... effectively blocking the exit .
i got the same problem with sauerkraut .
hold on .
back up .
are you sayin ' this whole volcano ... can blow at any time ?
no , no , no , no .
that would take an explosive force ... of great magnitude .
maybe i should do this later , huh ?
if we could blow the top off of that thing , we' d have a straight shot to the surface .
mr. thatch , what do you think ?
mr. thatch ?
thatch ?
hey , wait !
who who are you ?
where are you going ?
come back !
hey , wait a minute !
who are you ?
sweet mother of jefferson davis !
it' s beautiful .
milo , i gotta hand it to you .
you really came through .
uh , i take that back .
holy cats !
who are these guys ?
they gotta be atlanteans .
what ?
that' s impossible !
i seen this back in the dakota .
they can smell fear just by looking at ya .
so keep quiet .
i think it' s talking to you .
ita , sum amice viator .
dices linguam romae .
parlez vous francais ?
oui , monsieur !
they speak my language !
pardon , mademoiselle ?
ah , voulez vous ...
ooh , i like her .
hmm !
' bout time someone hit him .
i' m just sorry it wasn' t me .
buenos dias .
guten tag !
how do they know all these languages ?
their language must be based on a root dialect .
it' s just like the tower of babel .
well , maybe english is in there somewhere .
we are explorers from the surface world .
we come in peace .
welcome to the city of atlantis .
come .
you must speak with my father now .
squad " b , " head back to the shaft ... and salvage what you can .
yes , sir !
we' il rendezvous in 24 hours .
let' s move it .
you heard him .
i' m so excited !
now , what' s really amazing is that ... if you deconstructed latin , you overlaid it ... with a little sumerian ... throw in a dash of thessalonian ... you' d be getting close to their basic grammatical structure .
or at least you' d be in the same ballpark ...
someone' s having a good time .
like a kid at christmas .
commander , there were not supposed to be people down here .
this changes everything .
this changes nothing .
take that , mr. harcourt !
your majesty ?
on behalf of my crew ... may i say it is an honor to be welcomed to your city .
ahem .
uh , excuse me ?
commander ?
you presume much ... to think you are welcome here .
oh , sir , we have come a long way looking for
i know what you seek ... and you will not find it here .
your journey has been in vain .
but we are peaceful explorers , men of science .
heh heh heh .
and yet you bring weapons .
our weapons allow us to remove obstacles we may encounter .
some obstacles cannot be removed with a mere show of force .
return to your people .
you must leave atlantis at once .
oh , your majesty , be reasonable .
sir not now , son .
trust me on this .
we better do as he says .
may i respectfully request that we stay one night , sir ?
that would give us time to rest , resupply ... and be ready to travel by morning .
hmm .
very well .
one night .
that is all .
well , thank you , your majesty .
mmm .
your heart has softened , kida .
a thousand years ago ... you would have slain them on sight .
a thousand years ago , the streets were lit ... and our people did not have to scavenge for food ... at the edge of a crumbling city !
the people are content .
they do not know any better !
we were once a great people .
now we live in ruins .
the kings of our past would weep ... if they could see how far we have fallen .
kida .
if these outsiders ... can unlock the secrets of our past ... perhaps we can save our future .
what they have to teach us ... we have already learned .
our way of life is dying .
our way of life is preserved .
mmm .
kida , when you take the throne ... you will understand .
so , how' d it go ?
well , the king and his daughter don' t exactly see eye to eye .
she seems to like us ok , but the king ...
i don' t know , i think he' s hiding somethin ' .
well , if he' s hiding something , i want to know what it is .
someone needs to talk to that girl .
i will go !
someone with good people skills .
i will do it !
someone who won' t scare her away .
i volunteer !
someone who can speak the language .
for the good of the mission , i will go !
good man , thatch .
thanks for volunteering .
go get ' em , tiger .
ok , milo , don' t take no for an answer .
look , i have some questions for you ... and i' m not leaving this city until they' re answered !
yeah , that' s it .
that' s good , that' s good .
i have some questions for you ... and you are not leaving this city ... until they are answered .
yeah , well , i ok .
shh !
come with me .
oh , there is so much to ask about your world .
you are a scholar , are you not ?
judging from your diminished physique ... and large forehead ... you are suited for nothing else .
what is your country of origin ?
when did the flood waters recede ?
how did you  wait a minute .
i got a few questions for you , too .
so let' s do this , ok ?
you ask one , then i' il ask one ... then you , then me , then ...
well , you get it .
very well .
what is your first question ?
well , ok , uh , how did you get here ?
well , i mean , not you personally ... but your your culture .
i mean , how did all of this end up down here ?
it is said that the gods became jealous of atlantis .
they sent a great cataclysm and banished us here .
all i can remember is the sky going dark ... and people shouting and running .
then , a bright light , like a star ... floating above the city .
my father said it called my mother to it .
i never saw her again .
i' m sorry .
if it if it' s any consolation ...
i i know how you feel , because i lost my
wait a minute .
wait a minute !
whoa , back up !
wh what what are you telling me ... that you remember because you were there ?
no , that that' s impossible ... because , i mean , that would make you ... you know , 8, 500 8, 800 years old .
yes .
oh , well , hey , uh , pfft !
lookin ' good .
just , uh , ahem ...
you got another question for me ?
yes .
how is it you found your way to this place ?
well , i' il tell you , it wasn' t easy .
if it weren' t for this book , we never would have made it .
ok , second question .
legend has it that your people possessed ... a power source of some kind that enabled them
you mean you can understand this ?
yes , i' m a linguist .
that' s what i do , that' s my job .
now , getting back to my question
this , right here , you can read this ?
yes , yes , i can read atlantean , just like you .
you can' t , can you ?
no one can .
such knowledge has been lost to us ... since the time of the mehbelmok .
oh , the great flood .
show me .
ok , uh ...
follow the narrow passage for another league .
there you will find the fifth marker .
yeah .
yeah , that' s it .
how was my accent ?
boorish , provincial ... and you speak it through your nose .
yeah , gotta work on that .
here , let me show you something .
what ?
it looks like some sort of vehicle .
yes .
but no matter what i try ... it will not respond .
perhaps if  way ahead of you .
ok , let' s see what we got here .
ok .
place crystal into slot .
yes , yes , i have done that !
gently place your hand on the inscription pad .
yes !
ok , did you ... turn the crystal one quarter turn back ?
yes .
yes !
while your hand was on the inscription pad ?
ye no .
ah , well , see , there' s your problem right there .
that' s an easy thing to miss .
you know , you deserve credit ... for even even gettin ' this far .
ok , uh , give it a try .
yeah , you got that right .
oh , th this is great !
with this thing ...
i could see the whole city in no time at all .
wonder how fast it goes .
so , who' s hungry ?
by the way , we were never properly introduced .
my name' s milo .
my name is kidagakash .
ki ki kidamaschnaga .
uh , hey , you got a nickname ?
kida .
ok , kida .
i can remember that .
wow .
what is wrong ?
oh , it' s nothing .
i just ... got something in my eye .
you know , my grandpa used to tell me stories ... about this place as far back as i can remember .
i just wish he could be standing here with me .
ah !
ah !
ee yah !
tell me more about your companions .
your physician , he is called cookie ?
no , that' s sweet .
what is ?
the doctor .
he' s sweet .
oh , he is kindly .
no , no , no , that that' s his name .
his name is kindly ?
no , sweet .
well , i mean , he' s kindly , too .
so all of your doctors are sweet and kindly ?
no .
well , i i' m sure some are .
ours is , but that' s not a requirement .
you' re missing the point .
you are confusing me .
wow .
look at all those tattoos .
shoot .
that ain' t nothin ' .
look here what i got .
all 38 united states .
watch me make rhode island dance .
go on , baby , dance .
dance .
there you go .
cookies are sweet , but yours is not .
sweet is kindly , but that is not his name .
audrey is sweet , but she is not your doctor .
and the little digging animal called mole ... he is your pet ?
close enough .
oh , don' t forget to eat the head .
that' s where all the nutrients are .
you know , kida ... the most we ever hoped to find ... was some crumbling buildings , maybe some broken pottery .
instead , we find a living , thriving society .
heh heh .
these guys are kinda cute when they' re not , you know ... formed into a fiery column of death .
we are not thriving .
true , our people live ... but our culture is dying .
we are like a stone the ocean beats against .
with each passing year ... a little more of us is worn away .
i wish there was something i could do .
i have brought you to this place to ask you for your help .
there is a mural here ... with writing all around the pictures .
yeah , well , you came to the right guy .
ok , let me see .
let' s start with this column right here .
uh , well , this , uh , uh , kida ?
uh , heh , what are you doin ' ?
you do swim , do you not ?
oh , i swim pretty girl .
pr pretty good !
pretty good .
sw good , swim good .
pretty good .
i swim pretty good .
good .
it is a fair distance to where we are going .
hey , you are talkin ' to the belly flop champ ... at camp runamuck .
oof !
come on , we' re we' re wasting time .
why don' t you lead the way ... because i have no idea where we' re going .
are you all right ?
well , i didn' t drown , so
good .
follow me .
this is amazing !
a complete history of atlantis !
it' s just like plato described it .
well , he was off on a few details , but
the light i saw .
the star in the middle of the city .
what does the writing say about that ?
i don' t know yet .
but we' re gonna find out .
come on .
the heart of atlantis !
what ?
it' s the heart of atlantis !
that' s what the shepherd w was talking about .
it wasn' t a star , it was it was some kind of crystal ... uh , like these !
don' t you get it ?
the power source i' ve been looking for ... the bright light you remember ...
they' re the same thing !
that cannot be .
it' s what' s keeping all these things ... you , all of atlantis alive .
then where is it now ?
i don' t know , i don' t know .
you' d think something this important ... would have been in the journal , but ...
unless ...
the missing page .
you have a nice swim ?
hey , guys , what' s going on ?
what' s what' s with all the guns ?
guys ?
i am such an idiot .
this is just another treasure hunt for you .
you' re after the crystal .
oh , you mean this ?
the heart of atlantis .
yeah .
about that ...
i would' ve told you sooner ... but it was strictly on a need to know basis ... and , well , now you know .
i had to be sure you were one of us .
welcome to the club , son .
i' m no mercenary .
whoa !
uhh !
mercenary ?
i prefer the term " adventure capitalist .
besides , you' re the one who got us here .
you led us right to the treasure chest .
you don' t know what you' re tampering with , rourke .
what' s to know ?
it' s big .
it' s shiny .
it' s going to make us all rich .
you think it' s some kind of a diamond ...
i thought it was some kind of a battery ... but we' re both wrong .
it' s their life force .
that crystal is the only thing keeping these people alive .
you take that away , and they' il die .
well , that changes things .
helga , what do you think ?
knowing that , i' d double the price .
i was thinking triple .
rourke , don' t do this .
academics .
you never want to get your hands dirty .
think about it .
if you gave back every stolen artifact ... from a museum ... you' d be left with an empty building .
we' re just providing a necessary service ... to the archeological community .
not interested .
i got to admit , i' m disappointed .
you' re an idealist , just like your grandfather .
do yourself a favor , milo .
don' t be like him .
for once , do the smart thing .
i really hate it when negotiations go sour .
let' s try this again .
knock , knock .
room service .
tell them to drop their weapons now !
spread out !
search everywhere !
you' re not applying yourself , son .
there' s got to be something else .
well , there isn' t .
it just says ...
the heart of atlantis lies in the eyes of her king .
well , then maybe old king cole here ... can help us fill in the blanks .
how about it , chief ?
where' s the crystal chamber ?
you will destroy yourselves .
maybe i' m not being clear .
ohh !
rourke , this was not a part of the plan .
plan' s changed , doc .
i' d suggest you put a bandage ... on that bleeding heart of yours .
it doesn' t suit a mercenary .
well , as usual , diplomacy has failed us .
now i' m going to count to 1 0 ... and you' re going to tell me where the crystal is .
1 ...
2 ... 9 ... t
the heart of atlantis ...
lies in the eyes of her king .
this is it .
we' re in .
rourke , for the last time ... you' ve got to listen to me .
you don' t have the slightest idea ... what this power is capable of .
true , but i can think of a few countries ... who' d pay anything to find out .
hurry .
get on .
jackpot .
ohh .
the kings of our past .
thatch , tell her to wrap it up .
we got a schedule to meet .
um ...
kida ...
i' m sorry .
come on , let' s get this over with .
i don' t like this place .
all right , thatch , what' s next ?
ok , there' s a giant crystal ... hovering 150 feet above our heads ... over a bottomless pit of water .
doesn' t anything surprise you ?
the only thing that surprises me ...
mahtim .
that thing' s not on the truck yet .
now move it !
i don' t know how to move it .
i don' t even know what' s holding it up there .
ahh .
talk to me , thatch .
what' s happening ?
look , all it says here ... is that the crystal is alive somehow .
it i don' t know how to explain it .
it' s their deity .
it' s their power source .
speak english , professor .
they' re part of it .
it' s a part of them .
i i' m doing the best i can here .
well , do better .
oh , i know .
why don' t you translate ... and i' il wave the gun around .
what did she say ?
i don' t know .
i i didn' t catch it .
hold your horses , lover boy .
kida .
kida .
no , don' t .
don' t touch her .
all right , step back .
sergeant , keep those people back .
you heard him .
step back .
i' m warning you .
so ...
i guess this is how it ends , huh ?
fine .
you win .
you' re wiping out an entire civilization ... but , hey ... you' il be rich .
congratulations , audrey .
guess you and your dad will be able ... to open up that second garage after all .
and , vinny , you can start a whole chain of flower shops .
i' m sure your family' s going to be very proud .
but that' s what it' s all about , right ?
money .
get off your soapbox , thatch .
you' ve read darwin .
it' s called natural selection .
we' re just helping it along .
commander , we' re ready .
yeah , give me a minute .
i know i' m forgetting something .
i got the cargo , the crystal , the crew ...
oh , yeah .
look at it this way , son .
you were the man who discovered atlantis ... and now you' re part of the exhibit .
let' s move , people .
that was an order , not a suggestion .
let' s go !
we' re all going to die .
oh , you can' t be serious .
this is wrong , and you know it .
we' re this close to our biggest payday ever ... and you pick now of all times to grow a conscience .
we' ve done a lot of things we' re not proud of robbing graves , plundering tombs ... double parking but nobody got hurt .
well , maybe somebody got hurt ... but nobody we knew .
well , if that' s the way you want it , fine .
more for me .
p. t. barnum was right .
we can' t let him do this !
wait a second .
ok , now you can go .
milo , you better get up here .
how' s he doing ?
not good , i' m afraid .
internal bleeding .
there' s nothing more i can do .
what a nightmare .
and i brought it here .
ah , don' t go beating yourself up .
he' s been after that crystal since iceland .
the crystal .
sweet , that' s it .
these these crystals ... they have some sort of healing energy .
i' ve i' ve seen it work .
no .
where is my daughter ?
well , she she ...
mmm .
she has been chosen ...
like her mother before her .
what ?
in times of danger ... the crystal will choose a host ... one of royal blood ... to protect itself ... and its people .
it will accept no other .
w wait a minute .
choose ?
so this thing is alive ?
in a way .
the crystal thrives ... on the collective emotions ... of all who came before us .
in return , it provides power ...
longevity , protection .
as it grew ... it developed a consciousness of its own .
in my arrogance ...
i sought to use it as a weapon of war ... but it' s power proved too great to control .
it overwhelmed us ... and led to our destruction .
that' s why you hid it beneath the city to keep history from repeating itself .
and to prevent kida from suffering the same fate ... as my beloved wife .
what do you mean ?
wh
what' s going to happen to kida ?
if she remains bonded to the crystal ... she could be lost to it forever .
the love of my daughter is all i have left .
my burden would have become hers ... when the time was right ... but now ... it falls to you .
me ?
return the crystal .
save atlantis .
save my daughter .
hmm .
so , what' s it going to be ?
excuse me ?
i followed you in , and i' il follow you out .
it' s your decision .
oh , my decision ?
well , i think we' ve seen how effective ... my decisions have been .
let' s recap .
i lead a band of plundering vandals ... to the greatest archeological find ... in recorded history ... thus enabling the kidnap and/ or murder ... of the royal family ... not to mention personally delivering ... the most powerful force known to man ... into the hands of a mercenary nutcase ... who' s probably going to sell it to the kaiser !
have i left anything out ?
well , you did set the camp on fire ... and drop us down that big hole .
thank you .
thank you very much .
of course , it' s been my experience ... when you hit bottom ... the only place left to go is up .
who told you that ?
a fella by the name of thaddeus thatch .
where are you going ?
i' m going after rourke .
milo , that' s crazy .
i didn' t say it was the smart thing ... but it is the right thing .
come on .
we better make sure he doesn' t hurt himself .
milo , what do you think you are doing ?
just follow my lead .
wow .
i' m impressed .
it' s simple .
all you got to do
yeah , yeah , yeah .
shut up .
we get it , ok ?
no , no , wait !
gently .
just gently .
hey , milo , you got something sporty ?
you know , like a tuna ?
how is this done ?
all you got to do is use the crystals .
kida showed me .
half turn right , quarter run back .
keep your hand on the pad .
saddle up , partners .
bring jerky and ammo .
i' m so excited .
all right , this is it !
we' re going to rescue the princess .
we' re going to save atlantis .
or we' re going to die trying .
now let' s do it !
i love it when i win .
ok , here' s the plan .
we' re going to come in low and fast ... and take them by surprise .
well , i' ve got news for you , milo .
rourke is never surprised , and he' s got a lot of guns .
great .
well , do you have any suggestions ?
yeah .
don' t get shot .
there they are !
we' ve got company !
take off !
take her up !
holy smokes !
you told me he only had guns .
what i said was , he' s never surprised .
ok , now things are getting good .
vinny !
heads up !
we can' t let them reach the top of that shaft !
aah !
vinny , new plan .
you and me , we' re going to be decoys .
audrey , sweet , fly up underneath that thing ... and cut her loose .
we' re on it .
lieutenant !
i though you said this thing ... could cut through a femur in 28 seconds !
less talk , more saw .
uhh !
looks like somebody' s working overtime .
come on , girl .
time' s up .
whoa !
all right , milo , this is it .
any last words ?
yeah .
i really wish i had a better idea than this !
we' re losing altitude .
lighten the load .
unh !
that' s it , unless someone wants to jump .
ladies first .
uhh !
you said we were in this together !
uhh !
you promised me a percentage !
next time , get it in writing .
aah !
nothing personal .
unh !
yaah !
aah !
uhh !
unh !
aah !
uhh !
well , i have to hand it to you .
you' re a bigger pain in the neck ... than i would have ever thought possible .
i consider myself an even tempered man .
it takes a lot to get under my skin ... but congratulations you just won the solid gold kewpie doll .
uhh ...
uhh !
uhh !
nothing personal .
tired , mr. thatch ?
hyah !
aw , that' s a darn shame ... because i' m just getting warmed up .
aah !
aah !
aah !
aah !
thank heaven .
whoa !
uhh !
ahh .
oh , great !
ahh .
the volcano she awakes !
hey , i had nothing to do with it .
this here would be a good place not to be .
no , wait .
we got to get her back ... or the whole city will die .
and if we don' t get out of here , we' il die .
it' s the only way to reverse this .
just do it !
milo , no !
go !
aah !
whoa !
whoa !
the fissure it is about to eject ... its pyroclastic fury !
milo , mole says the wall' s going to blow !
unh !
uhh !
uhh .
milo ?
atlantis will honor your names forever .
i only wish there was more we could do for you .
uh , you know , thanks anyway ... but i think we' re good .
they' il take you as far as the surface .
we are really going to miss you , milo .
you know , i' m going to reopen the flower shop ... and i' m going to think of you guys every single day
monday through friday , 9 : 00 to 5 : 00 ...
saturday until 2 : 00 .
sunday i' m going to take sunday off probably , and ...
maybe i' il go in for a couple of hours , you know ... but august i' m going to take august .

there' s a hero' s welcome ... waiting for the man who discovered atlantis .

besides , i hear there' s an opening down here ... for an expert in gibberish .
