tension that had been brewing for months in nigeria exploded yesterday ... ... as exiled gen. mustafa yakubu orchestrated a swift and violent coup ... ... against the democratically elected government of president samuel azuka .
in the land with 1 20 million people and over 250 ethnic groups ... ... there' d been a long history of ethnic enmity ... ... particularly between northern fulani moslems and southern christian ibo .
the victorious fulani rebels have taken to the streets ... ... as outbursts of violence continue all over the country .
thousands have been killed in the fighting or executed thereafter .
fearing ethnic cleansing , most ibo have abandoned their homes ... ... and are fleeing the city or searching for sanctuary wherever they may find it .
gen. yakubu has taken control of most of the country ... ... and appears firmly in charge .
there' s no word on the united nations ' reaction to the coup ... ... but united states forces have already begun to evacuate its embassy .
as you can see behind me , on the uss harry s. truman ... ... activity is high as foreign nationals are evacuated from all over nigeria .
this once peaceful country ... ... has been rocked by a series of ethnic unrests and brief but bitter battles ... ... mainly over control of nigeria' s vast oil supply .
however , nothing can prepare the country ... ... for the overwhelming and decisive action that has just taken place .
we have just heard that the entire presidential family ... ... has been assassinated .
the entire presidential family has been assassinated .

now you got something to say to me , don' t you ?
my name is arthur azuka .
i' m the only son of president samuel azuka .
please don' t blame them .
please .
i' m sorry to have misled you ... ... but there are enemies looking for me everywhere .
that is why you' re being pursued .
our report said the entire presidential family was executed .
your reports were incorrect .
they were not executed .
they murdered my father ... ... along with my mother ... ... and my two ... ... younger sisters ... ... out of greed ... ... and my father' s fight for democracy for his people .
my people .
when it first appeared there might be trouble ... ... my father sent me away with this man .
col. okeze .
lieutenant , his father was more than the president .
he was the tribal king .
that makes him the heir to the lbo nation .
it' s a bloodline they must cut .
the fulanis will comb heaven and earth to find him .
you knew about this ?
you knew all the time , and you didn' t tell me .
i didn' t trust you ... ... at the time .
i wonder what it takes to earn your trust .
red , lake .

how many men do you have in gashanka ?
right on time .
good hustle , red .
come on up and brief zee .
this river will get us straight into cameroon .
they' il be expecting us .

roger that .
let the other men know .
yes , sir .
good job .
l. t.
what do you got ?
rhodes on the phone .

lntel reports military elements in your sector ... ... conducting search and destroy of a u. s. military unit ... ... moving with arthur azuka , son of the late president .
what can you tell me ?
yes , sir , we just discovered that ourselves .
he and his bodyguard hid themselves within dr. kendricks ' refugee party .
that' s a major problem , lieutenant .
he involves your mission in the internal politics of a foreign nation ... ... affecting u. s. diplomacy and seriously increases the mission' s risk .
he' s considered a criminal by the new regime .
he' s a major liability .
what exactly does that mean , sir ?
his party is excess cargo .
you mean he' s not human , sir ?
captain , this man is the lbo tribal leader .
do you know what that means ?
cut the shit .
who do you think i am ?
sir , we both know what' il happen to him if i leave him out here .
there won' t be a trial or a jury .
outside the courthouse , they' il put two in his head .
i' m just asking for a little help here .
put yourself in my shoes , bill .
i' ve been in your shoes , lieutenant .
send in an air evac immediately and get all of us out of here , sir .
negative on air support at this time .
airspace is too hot .
your judgment has risked the lives of your men and the mission' s success .
i advise you , complete the evacuation as planned !
do you read me ? !
yes , sir , i read you .
loud and clear .
but i cannot , in good conscience , do that without taking these people to safety .
that' s not your mission !
when have i not completed a mission ?
my team will complete this mission .
i give you my word on that .
i don' t like this .
get your ass back here alive soon as possible .
maintain contact with op center .
i' il direct air support as soon as i can .
i promise you .
yes , sir .
eagle one , out .
bring them up .
everybody up on l. t. now .
double time .
so much for diplomacy .
come on , let' s go .
here' s the deal .
it' s been strongly suggested that we turn over arthur ... ... and abandon these refugees out here in the bush .
i' il tell you right now i' m not gonna do that .
i can' t do that .
i broke my own rule .
i started to give a fuck ... ... and brought you guys along with me .
we' re about to walk into some serious shit .
before we do , i' d just like ... ... to hear what you guys have to say about it .
that' s all .
speak freely .
ln my opinion , sir ... ... we cut our losses .
this isn' t our fucking war .
as far as me being in or out ... ... you know the answer to that .
let' s get these people to safety .
let' s finish the job .
i can' t leave them , sir .
i' m good to go .
what about you , red ?
i can' t look at them like packages anymore .
i' m gonna get them out ... ... or i' m going to die trying .
are we there yet ?
thanks , fellas .
strip those packs down to rolling gear only .
have the refugees drop anything that don' t go " boom . " let' s move .
double time .
let' s go .

for all the years that we were told to stand down and to stand by ... ... you' re doing the right thing .
for our sins .
