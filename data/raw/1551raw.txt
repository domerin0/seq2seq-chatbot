' cause he' s gross ?

it' s a traumatic experience .
i don' t want to talk about it .
we like traumatic stories .
not about me , but ...
trauma bonds people .
you can tell us .
it bonds those who go through it ,
not the people you tell it to .
tell the fucking story !
all right !
so there' s this bowling alley when we were growing up .
you guys might remember it lenny meads brighton bowl ?
it was in brighton , right ?
that' s probably why it was called brighton bowl .
we used to go there for birthday parties or with my dad for the weekend .
this one time , i asked my dad if we could go .
he' s like , " no .
the bowling alley' s closed .
this marshmallow' s so burnt !
it turned out there had been a break in .
all the employees were held at gunpoint .
after they had been gagged and beaten , they were tied to chairs .
the chairs ... they were set in a circle , so that way everybody was forced to watch everybody else .
and then the robber , this sick maniac , he goes and finds one of those little ball peen hammers .
and then one by one ... he smashed the backs of their heads open with the hammer .
everyone had to watch their friends die , knowing that they' d soon be next .
ball peen ...
the guy doesn' t stop there .
he breaks out the fire axe .
the alarm goes off ... he doesn' t give a shit .
he hacked off all of their limbs .
the cops found six bloody torsos tied to the bowling seats .
blood everywhere ...
turns out the guy was some disgruntled employee .
that was my childhood playground .
bert , you asshole , it' s not funny .
yes it is , you fucking slut .
jeff ?
what ?
tell them about the happy bald guy .
no , i can' t take it .
he gave us our shoes and quarters for the video games .
there was a room with a pool table , but my dad wouldn' t let us go there .
the bald guy was always happy , always smiling .
but the killer got him too .
when the cops searched the place , they found hacked off limbs at the end of the bowling lanes .
the guy had bowled people' s organs .
arms , legs , everything .
they found the bald guy' s head in the ball return .
he was still smiling .
oh , no .
i knew you were full of shit !
you suck !
no !
it was in the paper .
i swear !
i' m laughing because
jeff is an asshole and he' s making me laugh .
i swear ...
i loved this place .
i still remember the sounds ... the cracking , the bouncing .
the smell of the shoes , the sound of the q bert machine ...
holy shit !
what are you doing ? !
i' m cool .
are you spying on us ?
i' m cool .
is your dog friendly ?
yeah , he' s cool .
this is dr. mambo .
here , boy .
come on , dr. mambo .
is it " dr. " like a physician or a professor ?
yeah , he' s a professor ... of being a dog .
oof !
faced !
scratch moded .
it' s a positive bonfire .
got room for one more ?
actually , we were having a private conversation , if you don' t mind .
that' s cool .
i guess i' il smoke all this weed by myself .
no , no .
it' s fine .
it' s not that private .

grim " is my skating name .
i got it in berkeley while competing in the x games .
really ?
karen' s going to go to berkeley .
dude ... awesome .
i love berkeley .
people there are so wacked .
i met these guys and they had me fucked up for five days straight .
they wouldn' t let me drink anything but beer .
yeah , i' ve done that , except i did it with jd .
karen' s got a great idea .
we should only drink beer for the rest of the trip .
i could probably do that , but i doubt you could .
i' il bet you .
i can only drink beer the rest of the trip .
if i drink anything else , you can have the rest of my supply .
all right , you' re on .
we only drink beer .
you' re on .
so , you' re a skater ?
is that your occupation ?
oh , crap .
party' s over .
hey justin ...
grim ... you want to come inside ?
i' d love to , but i left all this shit outside my tent .
it' s starting to rain , if it gets fucked up , it' s like $4, 000 worth of shit pissed away .
how far away is your tent ?
20 minutes away , but if i book i can be back in 30 .
cool .
bring the weed .
i will .
check you dudes later .
come on , dr. mambo .
freak .
i thought he was funny .
how did it work ?
what do you mean " how " ?
it had a hose ... a bunch of different settings , pulse , power ... stream .
and you came every time ?
totally .
you can imagine my disappointment the first time i had sex .
tell me about it .
what' s that supposed to mean ?
i' ve got a better story .
i' m sorry , but no story is better than karen and the shower massage .
no , seriously .
one time i was masturbating ... and my dog came up and started licking my balls .
right as i came it stuck its tongue up my ass .
that' s serious fucking masturbation talent right there .
fucking good .
he' d better have brought more weed or i won' t let him in .

there' s no way this contagious fucker' s coming in here .
he' s sick , for christ' s sake .
you want him to come in here and touch all of your shit , your fucking soap ... ?
let' s throw him a blanket or something .
or your douche ?
let' s drive him to a doctor .

what else were we gonna do ?
first he gets his shit all over the car , and i don' t want him touching me , you , or anybody .
i think the rain will put him out .
he' s dead anyway .
you saw that shit on him .
he looked like he was skinned alive .
we have to tell the police it wasn' t our fault .
i think we should tell them now .
calm down .
there' s nothing we can do .
the car' s fucked .
we need a mechanic .
we' il find somebody who knows one , and then we' il report the accident .
that' s the keyword here .
it was an accident .
the guy' s skin ... holy shit .
you should clean up some of this shit while we' re gone .
i' il save some for you guys .
just stick with the girls .
what' s that supposed to mean ?
it means you' re a fucking pussy .
that' s fucked up .
what' s fucked up is you beating the shit out of my truck .
what about the jag off with the rifle ?
did you forget about him ?
we all fucked up that car , don' t just put it on me .
good morning , boys .
are you going to kill each other now ?
where are you going ?
to get help .
so ...
bert and jeff are gone .
i know .
last night was a fucked up situation ,
and i think ...

we lit him on fire .
can you understand if i' m not in a particularly social mood ?
i got scared .
i was ...
i was just trying to help .
karen ...
i' m sorry , paul .

i am not about to eat that meat .
would you ?
no , i' m a vegetarian .
none of this shit is good .
it' s all sick .
it' s all gotta go back .
i want me a new hog !
we were just looking for a mechanic .
mechanic ?
you won' t find one around here .
you' il have to go to town .
that' s the thing .
our car' s busted , so we can' t get into town .
we need somebody to take us into town
so we can find a mechanic .
oh .
i' ve already been in town today , sorry .
all right , if you do go back , would you tell us ?
we' re staying at a cabin , and ... we don' t know murray .
oh , i' m sorry .
yes , of course , of course .
why didn' t you just come out and say that ?
come on inside , i' ve got a radio .
we' il call ricky .
he' s got a tow truck .
call ricky .
ricky .
sorry to bother you , but this crazy guy came out of the woods and tried to trash our car .
sounds terrible .
i have some juice .
so this person damaged your car ?
it was just this crazy hermit .
real dangerous .
we chased him away with bats .
it wasn' t henry , was it ?
nah , shit , never .
henry ?
my cousin henry .
he knows about that ordinance .
he wouldn' t do something like that .
you hit him with a bat ?
no .
no , it wasn' t henry .
our friend walter , he got drunk .
one thing led to another ...
that' s no good .
yeah .
i' ve got a great idea .
why don' t we take a walk down ourselves ?
it' s really nice out .
we' il just walk .
i haven' t seen the scenery .
you sure ?
ricky' s awfully handy .

i followed the path that the old guy ran , but i couldn' t find him .
he could still be alive .
no , it' s impossible .
want any beef jerky ?
no , put it away .
why ?
it' s not our house .
so ?
did you find a phone ?
no .
i felt weird looking around .
there' s nobody here .
we found this other place , but ... there was nobody there either .
i wonder if the cops know about it yet .
i doubt it .
if they did know , they' d have been at the cabin by now .
good morning .
deputy winston ,
bunyan county sheriff' s department .
hi .
what can i do for you ?
i' m on patrol in my jurisdiction and i heard there was a lot of commotion here last night .
i wanted to know what the story is .
yeah , sure .
some guy tried to break into our cabin .
and he was sick .
i don' t know what kind of disease he had , but he was a mess .
i have to report this .
yeah , totally .
my friends are out looking for a neighbor so we could call you .
we don' t have a phone here .
everyone uses radios .
that' s what i use .
hey ...
looks like you guys were doing some pretty good partying , huh ?
yeah , you know , we were drinking ... and then this guy came along and tried to break into the cabin .
we had no choice but to get rough .
i feel awful , but he was going crazy .
he smashed into our car , and then he wouldn' t come out , so ... we had to hit him .
we hurt him .
we were terrified .
we didn' t know what to do .
that' s why we went to look for help
hey , man , i told you ...
i' m gonna make a report .
don' t worry about it .
he ain' t gonna come back .
looks like you guys scared him away pretty good .
i ain' t gonna let him ruin your fun .
thank you .
my friend' s inside right now and she' s pretty freaked out .
she wants to go home .
we all kind of do .
a lady friend , huh ?
i bet you like to party ... with the ladies .
paul ?
is everything okay ?
howdy , ma' am .
everything' s fine .
just go back inside , have yourself a big 40 , just party .
umm ... okay .
oh , daddy , why are you talking about leaving ?
you' ve got to stay and party .
that' s why we came here in the first place .
i' m telling you , this is a major party town .
really ?
are you kidding me ?
you know what it' s like when you go to a new town and you' re the new guy ?
all the girls see you walking down the street ... they don' t know you' ve got five pounds of dangling meat .
they' re looking for no commitment .
you understand what i' m saying ?
i' ve heard that theory before .
this is that town .
it' s like when i go party up at wambusau .
my cousin goes to school there .
when i party at wambusau , i know i' m gonna get pussy .
plus the girls there don' t know i' m a deputy .
so i know they' re gonna party hard with me .
believe me , man , they do .
that' s too bad , i bet you ruled this town before you had a badge .
yeah , but a badge makes you grow up quick .
shit , this guy went and did a number on your ride .
i' m gonna put out an apb .
we' re gonna catch this guy .
yeah , it wasn' t totally him .
we hit it too .
but we were trying to scare him away .
could you get somebody up here to fix it ?
what do i look like ?
an idiot ?
i' il have someone up here by tomorrow afternoon .
you' re top priority .
you' re the party man .
do you realize how many great parties we' re gonna have ?
fortune' s shining on you .
i know where all the big parties are at .
remember , my name is winston .
you know how to get a hold of me , right ?
9 1 1 ?
that' s it , my man .
take it easy .
yeah .
did he say he was gonna report this shit or not ?
i think he is .
he didn' t make it seem like we did anything wrong .
he said he' d get a tow truck up here .
sounds weird to me .
the guy was weird .
once he saw karen , he didn' t want to leave .
has karen left her room yet ?
no , she' s still sleeping .
i don' t know what' s up with her .
she wants to get out of here as soon as she can .
puts a kink in your plan , huh ?
what plan ?
what plan ?
the plan you' ve been trying to execute since eighth grade .
no , there' s no plan .
not anymore .
whatever .
you guys are funny .
fucking ... she likes you because you' re nice to her and she' s nice to you because she can control you .
fucking , you' re nice to her ...
bert , don' t move .
fuck .
it' s that freak' s dog .
should i hit it ?
i don' t know .
if you' re gonna hit it , hit it hard .
so where' s grim ?
he' s out there rotting .
there' s some sick shit in the woods and the hermit' s spreading it around .
i' m not waiting for that deputy to come back .
let' s get out of here now .
should we say something on our way out , like , " by the way , we burned some guy alive " ?
yes .
no .
jeff .
fine , we' il tell the cops .
we have to .
they' re gonna figure it out .
the deputy knows something happened .
we' re the only outsiders .
they' re gonna trace it back to us .
i feel nauseous .
karen ...
how soon can you get us out of here ?
i don' t know if i can fix the car .
i' m thinking i could make it drivable , we could drive into town and tell them what happened .
and that' il be that , right ?
but you' re gonna have to watch me with the gun .
i' m not gonna go out there with that fucking dog around .
i need a bath .
jeff' s mom has the stupidest ideas
