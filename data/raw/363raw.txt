please , wait another month .
i beg you .
stop kidding us !
we are no boy scouts !
i can' t give you something i don' t have .
it' s not my fault .
you could sell some land , or some of your machinery .
there are endless possibilities of getting into money .
everything is already given in mortgage .
then you' il have to sell your body , right ?
your heart ... your liver ... your eyes ...
if you start threatening me , i' il go to the police !
you can' t be a yakuza if you' re afraid of the police !
do you want me to rip your eyes out ? !
brother !
shut up , brother !
kobayashi ...
kobayashi ...
hey !
i' m gonna kill you !!
i' m gonna kill you , and then i' il die !!
wait !
freeze !
i' m gonna kill you !!
and then i' il die , too !
hey !
hey !!
we' re sorry .
there' s nothing worse than a yakuza being fooled by an underdog .
exactly how long have you been working for us now ?
please let us try again , then we' il certainly ... junji .
do you really think that you' il bring home the bacon the next time ?
forget about him , i want you to be honest !
will hagane be able to collect the debt ?
i don' t think so .
you idiot !
even your little brother doesn' t put it past you !
matsuba !
yes ?
work with junji .
if he' s going on working with hagane , he' il be wrecked .
okay .
hey , hagane !
yes ?
go und scrub the john .
hey , naomi !
i' ve been waiting for you !
you need money , right ?
don' t talk like that !
50 . 000 yen .
okay , 30 . 000 ...
no , i just need 10 . 000 .
soon i' il be very rich and i' il take care for you !
okay ?
i' m sorry .
i' m all knocked out ...
your dick is too small .
and you can' t even get it up ...
shut up !
ouch ... !
what was that for ? !
you must be completely crazy !
i' m not afraid of you !
you can' t even fuck me properly !
so don' t act the big shot , do you hear me ? !
don' t try something like that again , asshole !
it' s cold !
what the fuck ... ? !
what' s up ?
what' s the big idea , you idiot ? !
sorry .
i' m really sorry .
you' re sorry ?
are you trying to kid me ?
go !
get up !
hey !
do you know who i am ?
i' m a yakuza .
do you want to pick a fight with a yakuza ?
you should go .
what did you say , you idiot ? !
hey , yakuza !
hey !
please , give it back ... !
shut up !
what' s in it ?
no bills !
really ?
fuck !
let' s go !
bye !
idiot !
i found it !
brother !
what are you doing ?
i lost my wallet .
brother matsuba is looking for you .
why ?
tosa will be released from prison tomorrow morning .
boss .
chairman yokoi has arrived .
oh yeah ...
you' re making me come to a place like that ?
yomo .
what do you want from me ?
the man ... who cut off your right arm will be released from prison tomorrow .
what do you think about the rumor ?
rumor ?
yeah .
the boss is going to retire and wants to tap neither yomo or tosa ... as his successor .
no idea .
yomo is the legitimate successor .
but for the boss , tosa' s just like his very own son .
furhermore , he saved our group ...
this is a really old hat !
the nakame goup is subordinated to the musashi group .
at that time , it is impossible that the groups start an internal fight .
our new boss can' t be just the one who finished off ... the boss of the nakame group .
you can' t seriously believe that !
kei .
take good care of yourself .
brother maeda has it in for you .
taka .
i know that , as a yakuza , i' m a total failure .
but i' m sure that things would change if tosa was my boss .
i really believe that .
tosa ... !
we' re relieved to see that you' re doing well .
i' m sorry .
the boss has an important meeting , that' s why he couldn' t be here .
how is his heart ?
not that good .
the doctor says a another collapse would be perilous .
i see .
he' s staying at the hakone hospital and he' s expecting your visit .
his rehab will go on until midday .
you shoud take a rest .
you have plenty of time to take a nice relaxing bath .
i rent a house for you at close quarters .
do i stop here ?
no .
drive on .
yes .
hello ?
hello , boss !
take brother tosa in .
yeah , i' m sorry .
hello ?
yeah , yeah , i know .
i know .
yes !
yes .
i remember you .
at that time , you were a trainee ...
yes .
i still have it ...
out of the way !
it is ... so big ... !
you' re that yakuza guy ...
look at you !
no more violence !
apologize for that !
ouch !
hey !
let' s go !
you bastard !!
hey ...
what do you think of my dick ?
who' s got the bigger dick , me or brother hagane ... ?
look at it .
take a close look ...
look at the two pearls ...
yeah , i see them ...
that' s so awesome ...
brother hagane is dead ...
who cares ?
come on , show me your pussy ...
apparently you woke up .
don' t worry !
i' il fix you , and then you will be able to move again .
okay ?
you' re not perfected !
you can' t go out just like that , you' re still not waterproof !
if your heart gets a short right now , you' re dead .
do you want to say something ?
what' s going on here ? !
come on , relax !
who are you ?
my name is genpaku hiraga .
i' m an ingenious chemist .
well , some people call me an otaku ... some even say that i' m some kind of " nutty professor " ...
i don' t care !
i just want to know why i' m here !
you don' t remember anything ?
maybe the correlative circuit hasn' t been closed yet ...
do you remember now ?
you and another man were killed .
i revived you .
creating the perfect human was my childhood dream .
and so i found myself a body to make my dream come true .
body ... ?
yeah .
you can get one amazingly easy on the black market .
there are a lot of people no one' s missing .
and there' s always somebody who just wants to get rid of some corpses ...
corpses like you .
three months ago , i paid 2 . 000 . 000 yen for the two of you .
who ?
well ...
i just went to an arranged place to pick up the bodies .
somebody told me over the phone where to transfer the money .
i don' t know who .
these were the rules !
you were in a really poor condition and had lots of bullet holes .
but miraculously ... the other man' s heart and your brain were still fully functional ...
i waited a long time for a body like that ...
due to my research ... it was possible to connect the brain and the heart and form a human being .
you were damn lucky , kid !
bullshit !
i was fragmented and patched up again !
don' t worry !
reassambling head and body is quite easy .
unfortunately , i ran out of money .
someday ...
i' il design your whole body out of metal ...
out of metal ... ?
yes .
bullets will ricochet off your body .
do you understand ?
your skills are exceptional !
your left eye can see infrared , and your right one can see the future !
even if your eyes are removed from your head , they still see everything !
your ears can hear every sound within a radius of 2 kilometres !
your physical strength is also supernatural .
even if you have to fight ten men , you' il surely win ...
i don' t need that kind of body !
that' s monstrous ...
i' d rather die !
i' d rather die " ?
apparently you haven' t understood yet why you' re still alive !
do you want me to thank you for that ?
no .
no ?
the other man covered you to intercept the bullets .
it was his will that saved you !
tosa had ...
i told you so .
i transplanted his heart into your body .
he still lives inside of your body ...
is the heart the only organ that you tranplanted ?
arms and legs were also transplanted and redesigned .
i also copied the nerve tracks that are responsible for ... coordination and fighting spirit .
what else ?
the dick .
the dick ...
including the balls !
i have tosa' s dick now ...
well , yours was still functional , but ...
you' re the strongest of all men now !
by no means you may betray somebody !
an furthermore ...
tosa ...
i have a request .
can you finish the tattoo ?
onigiri ...
first and foremost , you have to eat metal .
it' s the ultimative energy source for your body .
is it good ?
that' s not important .
slowly but surely , you' il lose your human emotions .
but if you' re overwhelmed by strong feelings all the same ... you may not be able to control yourself .
the results are a loss of energy , system errors and a complete short .
just take good care of yourself ...
i' m going to lose my feelings ... ?
to love someboy , hating , getting angry , crying ...
you can do without stuff like that , can' t you ?
oh , no ...
i installed a system that' s going to soothe you in case of emergency .
if you feel that your emotions are going to overwhelm you ...
in this case , push that button and repeat the magic formula .
magic formula ?
hush , little baby , don' t say a word
you have to repeat it three times .
what ... ? !
it' s a lullaby .
my granny used to sing that song to me when i was little .
defence against an attack from the right side .
defence against an attack from the left side .
it' s exactly the same .
move forward .
withdraw .
there we are !
perfect .
what are you doing ? !
what are you gonna do ?
i' m going away .
you' re going away ?
why ? !
somebody killed us .
i' m not willing to accept that .
just don' t do anything stupid !
do you want to take revenge ?
you should be a lover of justice !
come on !
repeat the magic formula .
hush , little baby , don' t say a word
if you can' t control your feelings , you' il get lost !
doctor .
i' m a yakuza .
there are a few things i simply have to do ... before i lose my emotions .
no , you' re a hero !
don' t overexert yourself !
don' t let your feelings overwhelm you !
it' s me .
what' s up ?
red just left .
then go and capture him immediately !
don' t worry .
i have an eye on every move he makes .
i' il watch his fighting strenght prospering .
did you call the general ?
that' s not necessary .
idiot !
what was that ? !
from the hip , understand ?
yes !
the successor hates nothing more than bad golfers .
and as long as you play that lousy , i can' t introduce you to him .
i' m sorry !
idiot !
the boss can' t do anything but retire ... if his successor nominates me for his representative .
the successor' s time has come !
yes !
go on !
yes !
you idiot !
watch out !
yes !
stop stupid idiot !
tosa is dead !
brother ... ? !
what was that ... ?
you survived , hagane ... ? !
a doctor saved my life .
did he save brother tosa , too ?
hey , what' s up ?
was tosa saved , too ?
are you sure ?
i see .
hagane .
could you tell the boss about that ?
yeah ?
he' s completely sure that tosa' s still alive !
yeah ?
brother .
could you tell me what happened ?
who attacked brother tosa and me ?
no idea ...
i want to know why you betrayed us !
no ... !
hagane !
i ...
i just want to take revenge ...
brother ...
he smushed my hands ...
shut up !
go and tell nakamura !
we wanted to get rid of hagane anyway , you idiot .
so take care of it !
brother !
cut it out , brother .
what' s the matter with you ?
stop it .
you' re not tosa , that' s not for you , brother .
i can talk to maeda .
you say that you' re sorry , and then you' re in again !
junji .
are you in love with naomi ?
i won' t let you ... make her miserable .
what' s going on ?
all of a sudden , you' re so cool ...
are you sure that he' il come ?
yes .
is that a blackout ?
hey .
hey !
patronage !
well , well !
i' m here to talk to the boss .
asshole .
you bastard !
asshole !
just you wait !!
stop !!
is that a monster ? !
we shot him , but he' s still alive !
hurry up and do something !
wait !
let' s talk about it !
i' m here to avenge yoichi tosa' s death !
i' il revenge tosa ...
no !
it was mutsumis idea alone !
he set the whole thing up .
maeda did it !
they wanted to get rid of tosa !
what an asshole !
who sold the corpse and took the money for it ?
i didn' t do it !
maeda said ...
he promised that ... he' d leave the two bodies to me !
two bodies ?
right from the start ... ?
he made me do it !
he told me to do in the man next to tosa , too .
he told me that this man ...
what did he tell you ... ? !
this man ...
he was worth nothing .
if he was dead , we would at least get some money !
they don' t know anything about your skills !
hey !
team up with me !
just tell me what you want !
okay ?
scum ... !
hey !
let' s go !
what' s up ?
this bastard hagane !
go and get him !
what ? !
yokoi ... !
hey !
hagane !!
i' il keep an eye on the boss .
finish him off !
hey !
show me what you got .
but !
first , i think you should see ... that i' m wearing tosa' s tattoo on my back !
you' re really cool ...
you bastard !
what ... ? !
do something !
hagane !
i didn' t order to kill tosa !
he did !
he did it !
maeda set up the whole thing !
and you expect me to believe that ?
it' s the truth !
i swear !
you have to believe me !
is that tattoo really tosa' s ?
what does that mean ?
some parts of brother tosa' s body ... were transplanted into mine .
what ?
transplanted ?
brother tosa ...
he' s living on inside of my body .
forgive me , tosa !
it was all my fault !
so i haven' t lost you forever .
i was so stupid , so goddam stupid !
i was an idiot , please forgive me !
forgive me ...
hagane .
hagane !
from now on , you' il do maeda' s job !
do you understand ?
let us fight together !
first , we' il finish off the musashi group !
okay ? !
don' t kid me !
i won' t let anybody pull a fast one on me ever again !
hey ... !
you' re breaking my arm !
stop it !
breaking your arm won' t be enough !
i' m gonna kill you !!
let him go .
taka ...
you can' t kill me with that thing .
i' m going to shoot at you anyway .
i beg you , taka .
don' t try to stop me !
i have to revenge brother tosa !
if you want to kill somebody , you' il have to start with me .
i won' t let anybody attack my boss .
i' il fight anybody and risk my life to save the boss .
the nakame group was finished off .
brother maeda is dead , too .
that' s more than enough , kei .
the monster and other tales
disqualified as a human being
pinocchio
you can try to hide , but i' il find you wherever you are .
this is the only place that you can return to .
damn it !
why do i always get bodies in such a poor condition ? !
the peach ranger ... still has room for improvement ...
it' s huge ... !
it was nine years ago .
he left me .
he said that together with him , i' d never be happy .
after that , he lunged at those guys to kill them .
he was a yakuza .
he had to do seven years .
he was killed right after he was released from prison .
he was such an idiot !
what are you doing here ?
i drifted for some time ...
i feel attracted to this place .
attracted ?
tosa
but i just understood why i' m here .
this place is something like ... my home ...
it' s strange .
near you i feel like ... he' s right next to me .
but you don' t resemble him in any way ...
hey ...
i' d like to stay for a while ...
hush , little baby , don' t say a word ...
what does that mean ?
that' s a magic formula .
it soothes me when i get too upset .
why ?
he' s been there for three months ...
why ?
your hands are as cold as ice ...
cold hands , warm heart " ...
i can' t believe it ...
your hands ...
they look exactly like my boyfriend' s hands ...
i beg you .
just once ...
i want you to sleep with me .
i want to forget him !
i finally want to get rid of him !
i wanted to fall in love with another man , but i couldn' t .
but i really believe that with you , i could finally forget him .
yukari ...
don' t you like me , keisuke ?
i do .
then what' s the reason ? !
i can' t .
i like you ...
i really do ...
but my body is ...
i don' t care !
i know that you have complexes because of your body .
but i don' t care about the way you look ...
i love you !
the better part of my body was destroyed in an accident .
half my body consists of metal .
i' m an ugly monster !
are you scared ?
i love you anyway !
no !!
good bye , keisuke .
i wanted to stay longer .
but ...
but as long as we' re together ...
i won' t be able to forget him .
i can' t love you both at the same time ...
5 5 3
not bad ... !
things are going well today , aren' t they ?
the wheather is great , too !
deputy of the boss ...
how do you feel ?
well , it' s a start .
i see things exactly the way the successor does .
there' s gonna be a lot of change .
you' re pretty ambitious , right ?
hey , caddy !
pitch !
i' il revenge him !!
get up !
hey , is everything okay ?
take care of him !
hey !
who are you ?
hey !
tosa' s girlfriend ?
i' m gonna kill you !!
hey !
leave that to me !
brother !
brother !
are you dead or something ?
what ... ?
you' re still alive !
you know that woman , don' t you ?
what did you do to yukari ? !
what did you do to her ? !
i' il tell you !
she tried to kill the representative of the successor and failed !
yomo is one of the boss ' successors ? !
she told us your name after we snatched her !
because of that , the boss knew that she knows where you are ...
hello ?
hey , hagane ...
you' re very strong ...
you already ruined one of my very expensive carpets ...
what are your demands ?
i don' t make demands .
i want a lot more than that .
the very best .
understand ?
you' il kill the president of the musashi group .
if you succeed , i' il give that woman back to you .
she' s missing tosa' s back ... she said ...
you bastard !!
help me ...
don' t worry !
the representative is really afraid of you .
because of that , he won' t kill the woman .
kei , it' s me .
don' t worry about the woman .
you' il get her back .
what about the musashi group ?
otsuki , the vice president , is going to be the group' s new leader .
the representative will be killed .
what about you , taka ?
if they' re all dead , i' m going to be the boss .
good .
that will restore calm within our group for a while .
kei .
it' s not too late .
don' t you want to extend the mutsumi group with me ?
that was our dream , wasn' t it ?
i can' t do that anymore .
kei ...
everytime i kick up , you pull in your horn .
you' re right .
what' s up ?
i have to hang up now , kei .
good bye .
go !
keep on searching !
hey !
i found something !
too bad ...
he could have served me well .
he could have been useful for the fight against the western groups ...
don' t worry about that .
now we just have to find the man who saved him .
he has to build more soldiers for us .
yes , exactly .
soldiers who work for us ...
everything' s ready .
okay .
this way , please .
president .
i prepared everything for you ...
you did ?
oh , yeah !
shit !!
i can' t believe they want to get rid of me , too !
from now on , i' il do anything you say , brother !
brother !
please , you have to revenge us !
she' s asleep ...
president .
have fun !
she' s really good ...
hey ...
let the boy begin .
hey , matsuba !
go ahead .
stop it , taka !!
hey ...
she still got all her teeth , but do you want to give it a try ?
it' s not so bad ...
come on , purse your lips !
hey !
that stupid cow !
damn it , that doesn' t do it ...
hey !
they' re leaving !
thank you .
thank you .
you should try that , too .
thanks .
oh god , i' m sick .
go !
hagane !
that' s too laborious .
run over him .
hey !!
what ... ?
hey !!
hey !
finish him off !
kei !
that was really cool !
clear off , taka !
taka !
i beg you !
i can' t do this ...
and that' s why everybody says ... that you aren' t a proper yakuza !
but i won' t run away !
i' m a yakuza .
taka ...
it hurts ...
it' s bleeding ...
i' m alive , right ? !
i' m ...
i' m still a human being , right ? !
kei !
good bye .
hey !
