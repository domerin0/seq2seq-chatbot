vicki !

yeah , well , i told her all my relatives were good looking .
jesus christ , man , it' s good to see you .
yeah , you too .
you look good damn good , considering you' re an old man now .
feels like the whole world' s gotten younger .
so , you' re doing okay ?
yeah , i' m okay .
how' s business ?
booming .
can' t keep up with the work .
in fact , i just hired a few new guys .
just until , you know , we catch up .
living across the street from a grade school .
jesus .
something wrong with that ?
i' m just thinking of the noise .
it' s the only landlord in town who' il take my money .
so , how' s annette ?
a little tense .
you know , you' re the only member of the family still speaking to me .
yeah , well , i remember when they all gave annette shit ... because she married the brown skinned boy from down the street except her brother .
and what about annette ?
i' m workin ' on it .
so how old is carla ?
she' s gonna be 12 next week .
we' re gonna throw her a big party on saturday .
i wish i could ask you to come .
good enough to eat today , baby .
ooh , yeah .
what the fuck do you think you' re doing , huh ?
how' d you like it if someone did that shit to your sister , huh ?
piece of shit !

oh , yeah .
play with yourself , asshole !
you okay ?
what ?
are you okay ?
yeah , i' m fucking fantastic .
so , what' d he do ?
what did who do ?
you know , the new guy .
drugs , armed robbery , manslaughter
mind your business , mary kay .
have you made any friends there ?
i' m not running for mr. popularity .
you seem a little hostile today .
it' s called sarcasm , dr. rosen .
no need to call me doctor .
i' m a therapist , not a psychiatrist .
it' s all the same to me .
walter , i' d like you to try something for me .
what' s that ?
i' d like you to keep a journal .
no fuckin ' way .
why not ?
evidence .
perhaps a journal would encourage you to reflect .
try it ?
sixteen , 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 .
320 feet .
how about that ?
want a ride ?
i' m all right .
it' s fucking freezing out here .
i' m fine .
come on .
i won' t bite .
something wrong with this picture .
here' s this nice , hard working guy ... suddenly appears out of the blue .
takes the bus to and from work .
i mean , who takes the bus anymore ?
people who don' t have cars .
it' s very weird .
not as weird as a sharp , young ... good looking woman working in a lumberyard .
oh , yeah ?
what' s weird about that ?
most women wouldn' t choose it .
guess i' m not like most women .
you never spoke to me before .
i thought you were a dyke .
are you ?
what do you think ?
you plan on drinking both those beers ?
i' m sorry .
is that a school ?
k through sixth .
doesn' t it get noisy ?
i like the noise .
i used to think you were shy ... but now i think it' s something else .
what ?
something happened to you .
yeah ?
i' m not easily shocked .
i get that impression .
so , you gonna tell me your dark secret ?
why do you want to know ?
don' t you think i should know before we have sex ?
i don' t like to waste time .
so , you gonna tell me your deep , dark secret ?
no .
okay .
so , you' re not a dyke .
not tonight .
hey , that was intense .
you' re still here .
i didn' t say i didn' t like it .
what are you doing ?
this table' s a heavy little bitch , man .
it' s cherry .
this wood .
it' s cherry .
it' s a nice table .
it' s my own design .
you' re not gonna find another one like it in the world .
it was a beautiful gift .
so , why are you giving it back to me ?
because , man , you need a table .
carlos , i made this table for you and annette as a wedding present .
i put a lot into it .
i know , man .
i love the table too .
but i also love my wife .
hey , you got a beer ?
i watch the kids arrive at school .
but for the last few weeks , i' ve noticed someone else watching them .
i call him candy .
she' s at the top of her class at school .
how about your kids ?
they' re good .
yeah ?
mm hmm .
yeah ?
she' s really doing great at school .
i don' t see her much , but
i' d keep away from him .
what ?
the new guy .
i' d keep away from him if i were you .
oh , yeah ?
why' s that ?
i think he' s damaged goods real damaged .
you know what i mean ?
yeah , mary kay , i think i do .
thanks a bunch for the advice .
suit yourself .
close , but no ciggy .
thanks , babe .
thank you .
hey , walter .
hello .
hello .
you okay ?
walter , what did you do ?
what happened to you ?
walter ?
why do you want to know ?
because i like you .
what' s the worst thing you ever did ?
the worst ?
i fucked my best friend' s husband .
i mean , my best friend since second grade .
he had the hots for me and yeah , he was cute .
we' d get it on for days .
and then he told her the shit .
broke up their marriage .
ruined our friendship .
i still feel like the lowest piece of shit when i think about that .
so , what did you do ?
i molested little girls .
twelve years in prison is no joke .
how young ?
between 10 and 12 .
once a nine year old told me she was 11 .
once a 14 year old told me she was 12 .
i always asked how old they were .
what did you do to them ?
it' s not what you think .
i never hurt them .
never .
look ...
i want you to go now , all right ?
i told you i' m not easily shocked .
yeah , well , you should be shocked .
or do you get off on this shit ?
what ?
when will i be normal ?
we have a lot of work to do .
will i ever be normal ?
what' s your idea of being normal ?
what' s your idea of being a fuckin ' shrink ?
sorry .
watch where you' re going .
sorry .
so what' s happening ?
braves are kicking the shit out of the phillies .
fucking phillies .
it' s just the beginning of the season .
you got to give them a chance .
so , how was the party ?
what party ?
the birthday party .
fuck .
it was great .
you should have seen carla .
she was so pretty .
she looked like a princess .
she' s the light of my life , man .
you don' t want to love them too much though .
no such thing , man .
i couldn' t love her enough .
oh , i' ve got photos .
you want to see ?
nah , it' s all right .
ah , come on .
i don' t want to see any goddamn pictures , all right ?
they' re just photos i took at the party .
carlos , i want to see my sister and my niece in person .
okay ?
yeah , okay .
i' m just saying carlos has a thing for his daughter .
if he' s not careful , he' s gonna suffer .
you think i' m crazy ?
do you think you' re crazy ?
you know , talking to you is like riding on a fuckin ' merry go round .
that' s a marvelous image , walter .
because by going in circles we find things we missed the first time around .
when will i be normal ?
so what should i do ?
call the cops ?
yeah , that' s pretty funny .
but what if candy seduces one to go for a ride ?
yeah , that' s right .
if the boy goes for a ride ... it' s because he wants to go for a ride .
walter .
cop .
sergeant lucas .
you mind if i come in ?
you are in .
yeah , i am .
but i always like to ask .
it' s a force of habit .
you don' t mind if i look around , do you ?
i would .
why , you got something to hide ?
doesn' t everybody ?
have a seat .
i could get a search warrant .
yeah , if you could get a search warrant , you would have brought one today .
this cherry ?
yeah .
it' s a little unusual design for a contemporary piece , but
walter ... two nights ago a 10 year old girl got attacked not far from here .
that' s a bit of a coincidence , don' t you think ?
what time did it happen ?
i' il ask the questions .
if you tell me what time it happened , maybe i could
get your hands out of your fuckin ' pockets !
sit down !
i know every fuckin ' move you make every goddamn step .
when you sleep , when you eat ... when you shit , when you jack off
when you' re sitting there by the window ... watching the little girls in their cotton white dresses ... and you' re sittin ' there on your little jack off bench , and you' re jackin ' off .
do you show your cock to little girls when you jack off ?
you can' t talk to me like  like what ?
like a piece of shit ?
that' s what you are to me , a piece of shit .
throw you out that window right now .
think somebody' s gonna miss you ?
i could say you jumped when i came in .
who you think they' re gonna believe , me or you ?
you' d just be a dead piece of shit .
we need to make sure ... that you' re being a good boy , walter .
okay ?
okay ?
okay .
okay .
okay .
have a good day .
nice table .
yes , may i help you , please ?
what did you think would happen ?
i don' t know .
what did you want to happen ?
i don' t know !
would you please stop writing in the fucking pad ?
you know that if anything happens to me , i go back to prison .
no parole .
no nothin ' .
for life .
is this the first one ?
of course it is !
why do you think i' m telling you ?
i want you to calm down .
you followed a girl .
perhaps you wanted to see what it felt like after so many years .
maybe subconsciously you were testing yourself .
and here you are ... talking about it with me .
this is positive .
walter , we' il pick up here next week .
remember when you asked me what ... my idea of normal was ?
normal is when i can see a girl ... be near a girl , even talk to a girl ... and not think about
that' s my idea of normal .
what are you lookin ' at ?
what' s this ?
what' s it look like ?
a plant .
i don' t need a plant .
everyone needs a plant .
this ivy is one tough baby .
it' s a cutting from one of mine .
so , here' s the deal .
give it a little water ... go easy on the direct sunlight ... and notice it every once in a while .
they love it when you look at ' em or touch their leaves .
think you can handle that ?
such an asshole .
thanks .
want to go for a ride ?
sure .
get your coat .
why do you stay ?
i see something in you , something good .
you don' t see it yet , but i do .
you know , most people say the odds are against me .
what odds ?
percentages ... for guys like me .
most of us end up back there .
well , most people don' t know what they' re talking about .
you want to talk about odds ?
someday i' il tell you how i survived ... as the only daughter in a family with three sons .
hell , maybe you should tell me now .
maybe not .
you scared ?
i got poked around here and there .
jesus .
which brother ?
all three , in chronological order .
why are you telling me this ?
i' m trying to tell you who i am , if you' re interested .
you must hate your brothers .
i love my brothers .
no , you don' t .
i love all of them .
they' re strong , gentle men with families of their own .
if you ever asked them about what they did to me , they' d beat the shit out of you .
and they' d call you a fucking liar .
hey ...
i never told anyone that before .
yeah , he' s right there .
hey , jim .
yeah .
okay .
i' il tell him .
bye bye .
bob said you wanted to see me .
he wants everyone to sign this card for reggie .
it' s a baby girl .
reggie must be a happy man .
i heard you' re lookin ' for another job .
where' d you hear that ?
around .
i' m not lookin ' for another job .
i just heard they' re looking for some good men down at dan shroeder' s place .
i like my job .
thank you .
so , i' ve got some good news .
what' s that ?
annette will see you .
aren' t you glad ?
when ?
early july .
that' s three months from now .
it' s a better time .
carla will be away at camp .
house' il be quiet .
it' s better when it' s quiet .
tell annette i' m busy in july .
now , come on , walter .
you should see my appointment book .
it just got crazy .
it isn' t what you think .
isn' t it ?
look , the important thing is that you and annette talk .
she needs to see you , and you need to see her .
i' m not a monster .
hey .
so next week , annette' s gonna be away for a few days , right ?
and the thing is , when annette' s away ...
i get horny as hell for other women .
i mean , i fantasize about fucking some beautiful woman .
you don' t have to tell me this .
i know .
i' m just sayin ' i understand .
it' s crazy out there .
i mean , girls wearing mini this , mini that
sometimes when i walk down the street and i pass a sexy looking woman ... she makes me feel like i' m bothering her .
hey , i see a pretty lady , i look .
that' s the price of beauty , my friend .
you wouldn' t believe the things carla and her friends are wearin ' these days .
can i ask you something ?
sure .
you ever have ... feelings for carla ?
what do you mean ?
you know , feelings .
look , man , i ain' t got your sick fuckin ' disease ?
is that what it is ?
whatever the fuck it is , i ain' t got it .
so if you ever touch my daughter , i' il kill you .
when i say the word " girl " ... what is the earliest image you can remember ?
when i say the word " pretty , " when i say the word " pleasure " ... who do you see ?
i see my sister .
where is she ?
she' s asleep in my bedroom .
where are you ?
i' m in my bed too .
how old are you and your sister ?
oh , about six .
that would make her four .
what are you doing ?
nothin ' .
takin ' a nap .
a nap ?
yeah , a nap .
kids take naps .
you ever take a nap , rosen ?
i don' t wanna talk about this .
what the hell are you doin ' back there ?
did you and your sister often take naps
i want you back in your chair .
now !
i' m sorry .
i don' t like nobody behind my back .
walter , what did you do while taking naps with your sister ?
nothin ' .
did you touch her ?
did you take her clothes off ?
you take your clothes off ?
this is bullshit .
i' m only asking questions .
all right .
i' m gonna tell you just to shut you up .
i smelled her hair .
what else ?
nothin ' .
that' s it .
i just liked smellin ' her hair .
you felt pleasure ?
yes .
did you get an erection ?
i was six years old .
i meant later , when you two took naps when the two of you held each other ... when you were 10 or 11 , and she was eight or nine when the two of you were all alone ... completely alone in that big house .
it was a small house .
all right .
a small house ... with small rooms .
i smelled her hair .
that' s all .
i just liked smellin ' her hair .
hi .
hello .
what are you looking at ?
up in that oak tree there' s a nest .
where ?
up there .
a little higher .
there are little chicks .
you want to see ?
sure .
they' re starlings .
is that right ?
i don' t like starlings .
why not ?
they' re extremely aggressive birds .
plus their habits are pretty filthy .
the mother must have her hands full .
so , you always carry these with you ?
when i go bird watching .
it' s why i like coming here .
it' s just a city park .
you' d be surprised how many kinds of birds you find here .
last week , i saw a purple martin ... and the week before that , i saw a solitary vireo .
that' s rare .
a solitary vireo ?
i like that .
their sound is really musical .
are you a bird watcher too ?
me ?
no , i' m a more of a people watcher .
the way you were staring at the tops of those trees ...
i thought you were gonna take off and fly .
i should go now .
you come here a lot ?
my daddy likes me home before dark .
well , it' s good to listen to your dad .
bye .
good morning , fellow sports fans .
the match is about to begin .
candy enters the arena looking sweet and trim .
he checks out the scene but plays it cool .
he' s definitely holding back .
uh oh .
candy' s eyes have locked on to something .
oh , yeah .
a cherub lad has separated himself from his friends .
candy quickly makes his move .
he offers the boy a bag of treats .
round one to candy .
the cherub walks away . !
round two goes to the cherub .
very risky move by candy .
i have never seen candy act so cocky .
the cherub looks at candy .
cherub looks for his friends .
but his friends are long gone .
the cherub is alone .
the cherub crosses the street
the cherub gets in the car .
hey , walter .
what can i do for you , sergeant lucas ?
you can listen to my stories about jesus .
oh , no .
this is too much .
this is too much sun .
what ?
this is ivy .
these plants don' t like a lot of sunlight .
don' t they grow outside ?
yeah , they grow outside .
but outside they got trees to shade ' em .
so now you' re gonna take me on a nature walk ?
have a seat .
so , yesterday you take the 12 bus home ... but you don' t get off at your regular stop .
you stay on .
why' d you stay on ?
fell asleep .
when i woke up , i was confused .
i got off at the wrong stop , and i walked home .
you walked home ?
yeah .
some of these guys ... they walk right into a family' s house .
very
it' s very fuckin ' ballsy .
had this one guy , he' s on death row
i' il call him henry and he' s tellin ' me about his last victim .
she' s a little little cutie named adele .
she' s seven years old .
and adele' s mother' s got the tv playing so loud ... he can hear letterman tellin ' jokes in the next room .
and he walks into adele' s room ... puts his hand over her mouth .
he says , " if you scream , little girl , i' m gonna kill your mother .
so , of course , adele doesn' t scream .
she doesn' t cry .
she doesn' t make a sound .
and henry takes her by the hand .
they walk out the front door .
ten days later , they find adele' s body what' s left of it .
you believe in fairy tales ?
fairy tales ?
yeah , like , alice in wonderland and
no .
yeah .
yeah , me neither .
what' s the one with the woodsman ?
woodsman ?
yeah .
with the ax .
i don' t know .
yeah , you know it .
the woodsman he cuts open a wolf' s stomach .
the little girl comes out alive .
little red riding hood .
little red riding hood .
that' s it .
that' s it .
the woodsman he cuts open the wolf' s stomach .
the girl comes out without a scratch .
you ever see a seven year old ... been sodomized in half ?
she was so small ... just broken .
i saw 20 year vets on that job hard guys , man and they just broke down and cried .
i was there .
i cried .
there ain' t no fuckin ' woodsman in this world .
i don' t know why they keep lettin ' freaks like you out on the street .
it just means that we gotta catch you all over again .
i' il see you , walter .
talk to me like you fuckin '
speak to me like you fuckin '
i am not
i am not
let' s go .
you don' t feel sorry for this sick fuck .
mind your own business , pedro .
this is my business .
what the hell is goin ' on here ?
who did this ?
any man who can' t deal with it , you meet me in the office .
i' il pay you for the week .
you can clear the fuck out .
we got a lot of orders today .
get to work .
this is bullshit .
are you okay ?
watch your back , bitch .
this is ready whenever .
where' s walter ?
i don' t know .
i don' t fucking believe this .
goddamn it , mary kay !
bitch , what the fuck are you doin ' ?
what is going on ?
this is bullshit , bob !
it' s bullshit .
people have the right to know .
see anything interesting ?
not yet .
what are you writin ' in that book ?
it' s my bird book .
i' ve identified 67 species of birds this year alone .
wow .
where are your friends ?
don' t you have any friends ?
i have friends .
a pretty girl like you should have a lot of friends .
i' m not pretty .
well , not in the common way .
what does that mean ?
it means that uncommon beauty ... is commonly overlooked .
you know , like people only notice ... the birds with the brightest colors .
what' s your name ?
let' s see .
linda .
susan ?
jennifer ?
jackie ?
you tell me your name , and i' il tell ya mine .
robin .
yeah , like the bird .
how old are you ?

i will be in three months .
i can' t wait .
i hate being 11 .
it has to be the stupidest age in the world .
what' s your name ?
walter .
do you have many friends ?
no .
how come ?
a long time ago , i was sent away f
when i came home , all my friends were gone .
sounds like you were banished .
banished , yeah .
birds are my friends .
they know i watch them ... but they don' t mind because they like being watched ... if they know you won' t hurt them .
robin  yes ?
would you like to sit on my lap ?
what ?
would you like to sit on my lap ?
no , thank you .
okay .
doesn' t matter .
do you want me to sit on your lap ?
yes .
i would enjoy that .
i know this place that' s really quiet ... except for the sound of these tiny little birds .
they sound like finches .
yeah , they might be finches .
do you want to see ?
my daddy lets me sit on his lap .
does he ?
yes .
do you like it when he asks you ?
no .
why not ?
are you two alone when he asks you ?
does he say strange things ?
does he move his legs in funny ways ?
walter ... do you still want me to sit on your lap ?
i will .
i don' t mind .
no .
go home , robin .
come on in .
it' s open .
hey , walter .
what can i do for you , sergeant lucas ?
i don' t know .
we' il see .
you didn' t hear ?
last night all that shoutin ' and screamin ' outside ?
no .
yeah , a guy got beat up pretty bad last night out there .
you don' t know anything about this ?
nope .
i could take ya downtown .
yeah , you could ... but it' d be a waste of your time .
there was a boy there .
he could i. d. the assailant .
he gave a description .
it fits you really , really close .
that' s a nasty scratch on your neck .
i got a passionate girlfriend .
what' s with the boxes ?
i' m movin ' in with her .
congrats .
lucky you .
i count my blessings .
yeah , i bet you do .
well , all right .
i' il be seein ' you around , walter .
hey .
you think you' re gonna catch this guy ?
yeah .
yeah .
we' re gonna catch him .
but the victim can' t talk .
among all his other injuries , he' s got a broken jaw .
however , we did run a check on the victim ... and as it turns out he' s wanted in virginia .
raped a boy down there .
you stay out of trouble , walter .
i' m watchin ' you .
i saw my sister .
it was hard .
she' s still really hurt and angry .
i understand that .
i do .
it' s gonna take time , walter .

i feel ... okay .
