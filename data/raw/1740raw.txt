soapbox leader , break it off .
home and tea .
for once you deserve it .
well done , everybody .
heinkel , three second burst .
starboard engine .
ruddy great flamer .
any identification marks ?
yellow stripes on the wings .
wing leader .
see it go down ?
did i ?
nyaow ... plunk !
hmm .
graham and jack will confirm your story .
that' s three of you who got him .
1/ 3 of a kill , laddie , 1/ 3 .
sir .
what did you hit ?
a heinkel .
anyone see mine go in ?
didn' t know you were with us .
well done , peter .
only 1/ 3 of a one , sir .
oh , that' s better than nothing .
i used to blast away and never hit a sausage .
one thing though ...
what' s that , sir ?
it takes us two years to train people like you .
suppose your controls had been damaged .
what would' ve happened to that idiotic victory roll ?
you' d have been spread all over the damn field ...
like strawberry jam .
never again .
clear ?
yes , sir .
something to make stuffy' s day .
the old man' s just gone down to the ops room with sasha .
final figures of the northern raids ... twenty three without loss .
jolly good .
i' il show it to him .
right .
we' re getting 6 volunteer pilots from coastal command ... and from the fleet air arms , sir ... five from each of the fairday battle squadrons ... and three from army cooperation .
that' s thirty , is it ?
not enough .
we lost that many yesterday .
and the air staff hesitate to weaken the light bombers ... in case of invasion , sir .
we need pilots now .
what about the foreign squadrons under training ?
czechs , poles ?
i know your feelings about the language difficulties .
they don' t understand a word that' s said over the air .
they' re a menace to themselves and us .
i' il try and cut more corners off the training program .
pilots are doing well ... enemy losing at the rate of two to one ... then he can afford to , can' t he ?
never sends more than half his bombers at one time .
we must find more pilots ... or lose .
begin .
this is off speed .
check 5 0 1 back at ready desk ...
i think you ought to see this , sir .
thank you .
air raid warning .
sector three red .
rabbit squadron .
tallyho , tallyho , red section .

don' t any of you joes talk english ?
corporal !
sir !
where are you taking those vultures ?
officers to the mess , ensigns to the guard room , sir .
like hell you are .
they' re responsible for all that .
get them to clear it up .
but what about the officers ?
give them a bloody shovel .
come on , step with it !
skipper hates jerries .
he' il hate me if you don' t get that gun repaired .
then wrap up this little lot .
only eight for the morning ?
got to do better than that .
five are write offs .
one has another guard gone , and two are missing , sir .
mr. anthony and sergeant moore .
and these two are hundred hour checks .
they' ve been at it for 48 hours solid , sir .
i know .
where the hell have you been ? !
learning to swim .
do your best , blaine .
roger .
you get one ?
all i got was a bellyful of english channel .
when are you going to learn ?
i didn' t know they were there .
never fly straight and level ... for more than thirty seconds in the combat area .
how many times have i told you ?
come on , i' il give you a lift .
i' d rather walk , sir .
cut out the " sir .
you called your wife ?
all right , boy .
get in .
here you are , sir .
thank you .
it' s ridiculous !
we go up four or five times a day ... and every time we come down , more potholes .
there are more potholes until we can' t bloody well get in a door .
we' il get this place operational again .
you won' t .
not until someone decides ... to protect it while we' re up .
what flaming genius thought of sending us ... to that dump of a flying club ?
don' t blame me .
direct orders from group .
park himself .
it' s not a bad little field .
i' ve seen it .
damp tents ... and a nasty little shack full of dead flies .
at least you won' t have the jerries visiting you .
i don' t blame them .
how much longer , hobbes ?
the engine' s overheating , and so am i.
we either stand down or blow up .
which do you want ?
hostile 1 6 , reconfirm , please .
need some more yellow sevens , flight .
this is r 29 , now forty plus .
1 5 .
yes .
2 6 and 4 1 detected , sir .
7 squadron' s airborne , sir .
thank you .
let 12 group know .
and make sure they know ... they' re protecting my airfields while they' re up .
they have been told , sir .
tell them again .
pine tree leader , this is turkey control .
vector 1 9 2 .
i have some trade for you over maidstone .
turkey control , pine tree leader .
roger 1 9 0 .
pine tree , this is turkey .
twenty plus bandits and angels 2 0 heading west .
roger , turkey control .
indiana left .
making low level attack .
roger .
i see you .
i' m breaking left to attack .
my god !
fighters coming down now !
fire speed .
break .
break !
on your tail , jamie .
enemy aircraft approaching , sir .
coming straight for us .
flying course , 21st .
about eight thousand feet .
i' m taking cover .
tin hats , everybody .
that should damn well never have happened .
where the hell is 12 group ?
they were requested , sir .
they' re nowhere in sight .
find out what the devil they think they' re playing at .
they just fell on us .
they got my number two and the c. o.
you saw canfield go down ?
it blew up .
just blew up .
bad as we thought ?
worse .
kenley and biggenor are shambles again ... and the rest are not much better .
god knows how many aircraft we' il have in the morning .
all because 12 group didn' t do their stuff .
leigh mallory and his so called big wings .
might as well stay on the ground for all the use they are .
we were up , sir .
trying to knock out the enemy en masse .
but it takes time to assemble 40 or 50 aircraft at 15, 000 feet .
it takes far too long .
by the time your big wing is up ... the enemy have hit their targets and are on their way home .
all that matters is to shoot them down in large numbers .
i' d rather destroy fifty after they' ve hit their targets ... than ten before .
don' t forget the targets are my airfields , leigh mallory ... and you' re not getting fifty .
you' re not even getting ten .
gentlemen , you' re missing the essential truth .
we' re short of two hundred pilots .
those we have are tired , strained ... and all overdue for relief .
we' re fighting for survival .
losing .
we don' t need a big wing or a small wing .
we need pilots .
and a miracle .
good night , gentlemen .
good night , sir .
good night , sir .
and now , over to the savoy hotel , london ... for dance music until midnight ... with carrol gibbons and his savoy hotel orpheans .
you look a damn sight better out of uniform .
hardly remember you out of yours .
and who' s fault' s that ?
for god' s sake , not again .
look , damn it , my squadron' s come south .
you just apply for that posting !
colin , no !
all right , agreed !
taboo subject tonight .
old wafs .
you really think we' re solemnly going ... to get into these ridiculous garments ?
not at this stage , surely .
i' m shy .
oh , maggie , come on .
it' s just ...
i am shy .
honestly .
i' il put out the light .
no , colin !
no , it' s not just bed , it' s us !
it' s you .
and me .
you and me .
we should have been over target nine minutes ago .
the wind has veered .
so where are we ?
where is london ?
far back in the south west .
good .
then get rid of the bombs and let' s go home .
colin .
i will put in for that posting .
promise .
that' s their bombs !
they' re bombing london !
it isn' t funny !
cut it out !
too damn close .
colin , i promise .
i promise .
attacks on london are strictly forbidden .
this order you know as well as i do , major brandt .
these attacks may only be flown ... on the specific order of the fuehrer .
i regret , gentlemen ... that this is now completely out of my hands .
by order of vice marshal goering ... you two are to report to berlin to testify .
thank you .
major brandt ?
flying officer froedl .
please follow me .
would you believe it ?
don' t they know there' s a blackout ?
if ever a bomb falls on berlin ...
" you may call me meier .
hmm .
you are to report to colonel schroeder at 9 a. m. sharp .
this car will take you to your quarters ... and you are to remain there .
as from today , we are called meier .
last night , bombs were dropped on berlin by the british .
so be it .
that is a game at which two can play .
if the r. a. f. drops three , four ... five thousand kilograms of bombs on germany in one night ... then in one night we shall drop three hundred ... four hundred , five hundred , five thousand on england !
when they attack our cities , we will flatten theirs .
then we will obliterate them !
the hour will come when one of us must crack .
it will never be national socialist germany !
never !
never !
the english are wondering .
they keep asking , " why doesn' t he come ?
be patient .
patience .
we are coming .
we are coming !
sieg heil !
sieg heil !
attention !
reichsmarschall , i welcome you in the name of ...
it' s all right , kesselring .
thank you , thank you .
ah , osterkamp , everything all right ?
yes , sir .
then it can begin .
come with me , kesselring .
yes .
don' t stand around like a bunch of pigs !
fall in !
i' il let the lot of you swim over the channel !
attention !
in the ditch !
march !
get off the road !
attention !
there they come .
if we lose the war now ... they' il tear our arses asunder .
arrow to rabbit leader .
vector 1 6 0 .
bandits one hundred plus .
angels 1 5 .
bandits one hundred plus .
over .
rabbit to arrow .
i can' t see them .
but they must be there .
well , come have a look for yourself then .
nothing , i repeat , nothing .
group , please .
everything we' ve got , and get them moving .
they' ve caught us this time .
they' re turning northwest .
it looks like london .
it' s london , all right ... and we' ve got everything up covering airfields .
where is the royal air force ?
messerschmidt .
iron corps .
messerschmidt !
no , they ain' t .
they' re iron corps .
five seconds .
away !
away !
the pressure' s dropping again .
this is as far as i can get , lad .
down at the end there , by that car .
hey , no you don' t .
what do you mean ?
there' s a thousand pounder down there ... and it' s not gone off .
if you' re looking for somebody ... they' re all down at the church hall .
they got the rose ' n ' crown .
he' il have to drink at the red lion now .
if they' il have him .
how bloody stupid can you get ?
i spend half a leaf seeing you all safe in the country ... and you bring her back to all this .
i' m sorry , it' s just we missed everyone .
you' re all going back .
dad , have you finished it ?
have you got it ?
thank you .
there' s a family trapped in shaw street .
can we have some more volunteers ?
i' il be back , luv .
stop that bloody bell !
it came more from the back .
not real spitfires .
they couldn' t land here .
you' il see in a minute .
only officers fly spitfires .
you' re not a fighter pilot .
what about your top button ?
anybody can do that .
t 5 ?
what' s that ?
they' re a training squadron , sir .
the poles .
get them out of it .
get them down .
blackhawk leader , vector 2 3 0 ... and return to base immediately .
over .
blackhawk leader .
received and understood .
out .
blackhawk leader to " a " flight .
turn to port and steer 2 3 0 .
germans !
germans , on the right !
i don' t see !
where ?
down there on the right !
i see the jerries .
i see !
stop that polish chatter and steer 2 3 0 .
repeat , please .
i say again , 2 3 0 .
repeat , please .
for crying out loud , 2 3 0 !
repeat , please .
repeat , please .
now , just shut up , the lot of you , and follow me ... unless you' re blind as well as ...
oh , god' s truth .
shut up !
silence , in polish !
get out quickly !
one , the r. a. f. is not a flying circus .
two , strict r. t. procedure will be observed at all times .
and it is never ... repeat , never ... to be used ...
for private polish chitchat .
finally , and god alone knows why ...
i' ve received the following signal .
congratulations .
as of today , this squadron is operational .
signed , " keith park ...
air vice marshal , a. o. c. 11 group .
i was wrong about the poles .
we also have the second polish squadron , sir .
i thought you' d mention that .
all right .
make them operational .
and the canadians ?
and the czechs .
we need them all .
looks like london again , sir .
yes .
and there' s nothing we can do about it .
but if goering should concentrate ... on london by day ... it' s another matter .
if it means he leaves my airfields alone ...
i shan' t complain .
even a few days would give me the chance ... to get back to full strength .
he' il have farther to come .
and to go back .
we' il have more time to intercept .
what' s more important , park ... his fighters have only fuel enough ... for ten minutes over london .
his bombers will lose much of their protection .
for the first time ... they' il all come within the range of 12 group .
perhaps now , at last , we shall see ... what leigh mallory' s big wings are made of .
turning on london could be the germans ' biggest blunder .
spider leader , this is top hat control .
bandits now twenty miles east of you , heading southeast .
vector 1 2 0 .
make , angel 2 0 .
roger , top hat .
fox trot leader , this is tango control .
fox trot leader , pass your message .
i have some trade for you building up over green " a.
roger , tango .
spider leader , top hat control .
your customers appear to be splitting up .
main course heading for london will be your target .
vector 0 9 0 .
roger , top hat .
batman control .
climb to angels 1 9 .
roger , batman .
thank you again .
this should give them something to think about .
starlight control to dogtail .
keep an eye out for a friendly wing ... joining you on your port side .
roger , starlight .
i see them .
i see them .
bloody marvelous .
fox trot leader , tango control .
bandits now probably slightly below you .
roger , tango .
i' ve got them .
peewee leader turning starboard now .

take the left hand pair , blue leader .
roger .
everybody else , keep tight .
swarms of them , sir !
fox trot leader , cut that out .
everyone keep quiet .

it' s the bloody bombers we want .
ox , will you pipe down ?

ox !
behind you !

i am on fire !
i' m bailing out !
good afternoon .
good afternoon my ass , you boche bastard .

i' m a polish pilot ...
cor blimey .
your mitts , mate ... your mitts .
put ' em up there .
go on .
get going .
where are you taking me ?
i' m fighting on your side !
can we get in ?
and fetch the doctor .
good .
i know , young man .
get out of the way , man .
it' s coming .
it' s coming .
are you telling me that your losses are critical ?
we' re bombing day and night , reichsmarschall .
our losses are high , and our pilots are tired ... and the planes need servicing .
be specific !
what are you telling me ? !
the english have changed tactics .
changed tactics ?
how ?
they are attacking in large numbers .
our losses might be reduced if our formations ... were more closely escorted by fighters , sir .
the fighters are always there .
but not close enough , is that it ?
you , yourself , were a fighter pilot .
the fighter is a hunter , sir .
i was a fighter pilot .
i was not a coward !
there is no suggestion of cowardice , sir !
i am making the suggestion !
from now on the fighters will stay close with our bombers .
and lose their natural advantages ... of surprise and speed ?
you will obey orders !
the invasion cannot begin until we have cleared the skies .
come , my friends , i have chastised you enough .
but i am here to help him .
is there anything you want ?
foehn ?
falke ?
yes , sir , a squadron of spitfires .
stop ... vapor trail .
left and above .
vulture leader to everyone .
keep quiet .
hold positions .
we' il encircle them only when they close up ... to firing distance .
we' il take the rear starboard .
yellow , you take the port .
roger .
thanks awfully , old chap .
sir , you know ...
i have promised the fuehrer ... to clear the skies and totally destroy the r. a. f.
i expect to be obeyed !
here we are .
the miracle of the loaves .
we should have moved in here before we were bombed .
maggie , i' d like you to meet our new assistant controller .
squadron leader tom evans , section officer harvey .
how do you do ?
hello .
he knows your old man .
how is colin ?
haven' t seen him since my little escapade ... with the burning hurricane .
excuse me , ma' am .
ma' am .
there' s a call for you .
will you excuse me just a minute ?
yes .
thanks .
it' s around the corner .
hello ?
it' s me .
how on earth did you get through here ?
put it down to rank .
i said i was an old battle ax from the air ministry .
colin .
that was very clever .
any news ?
about ?
your posting , you silly idiot .
well , you' ve applied .
i' ve been so busy here .
it' s really not as simple as all that .
look , why the hell not ?
to be absolutely honest , i forgot .
i know , darling .
i' m sorry .
groopy' s here now .
i' il go and talk to him right away .
all right ?
all right ?
colin ?
colin ?
get through all right , sir ?
yes .
let me give you a piece of advice .
what' s that , sir ?
stay single .
are you still with me , dogtail red 2 ?
affirmative , red leader .
directly behind you and on your starboard side .
what happened to harvey ?
he got a 1 0 9 , then ran into trouble ... but he' s all right .
no mistake .
i saw him bail out .
right , right , attention .
right .
stand at ease .
corporal seymour will detail you to your various watches .
i left out the bit about the wolf whistles .
you' re better at that .
the troops have other things on their minds nowadays ... thank goodness .
right !
shun !
it' s colin .
he isn' t dead , maggie .
he' s going to be all right .
they can do wonders nowadays , you know .
it' s just a question of time , that' s all .
we' il get you a posting so you can be near him .
is he badly burned ?
you sent for me , sir ?
yes , peter .
i want you to take over red section .
who are my numbers two and three , sir ?
a couple of new lads .
they' re outside .
right , then .
how many hours on spits ?
ten , sir .
seven , sir .
stick to me like glue and keep your eyes open .
control .
put out 2 2 2 and 6 0 3 squadrons ... against hostile 2 6 .
winston would pick a day like this to come .
is everything up ?
the lot , sir .
reserves ?
none .
that' s what i' ve just told the prime minister .
red 3 , this is red 1 .
much closer .
i can hardly see you .
red 2 .
you must keep up with me .
right , red section .
here we go .
stick to me like glue .
red 3 , behind you !
come in , blue 2 .
hey , kids .
shut up , will you ?
this is the bbc home service .
here is the 9 : 00 news ... and this is armand adell reading it .
up till 8 : 00 tonight ... 165 german aircraft have been destroyed ... in big scale attacks attempted by the enemy today ... on london and the southeast .
we lost thirty fighters with ten of the pilots safe .
buckingham palace has been bombed again ... but no one was hurt .
yes ?
yes , one moment .
it' s the air minister , sir , on the scrambler .
yes ?
dowding .
look , our people in washington ... are having trouble with the american press ... and it' s about today' s figures .
german sources there are saying ... that our claims are wildly exaggerated .
hello ?
are you there , dowding ?
i' m here , minister .
well , can you verify the figures ?
i' m not very interested in propaganda .
if we' re right , they' il give up .
if we' re wrong , they' il be in london in a week .
morning , arnold .
morning , sir .
morning , sir .
morning , arnold .
morning , clyde .
dispersal .

quick march !
you have let me down !
you have betrayed me !
