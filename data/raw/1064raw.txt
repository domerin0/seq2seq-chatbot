church leaders blame the rise of hate crimes and racially motivated attacks ... ... on a militia like group calling themselves " the holnists .
one of the most radical and powerful of these groups ... ... claims as its founder , the famed motivational speaker nathan holn .
the last of the great cities died ... ... when my father was a child ... ... victims of yet another war .
he told of the plagues that followed ... ... and how the living hid themselves , scattered in tiny hamlets ... ... in hopes of surviving whatever new madness ... ... conspired to rob them of the little that remained .
in those days , he walked alone ... ... a solitary witness to the chaos that reigned .
the earth itself had fallen victim to the insanity .
he told stories of the 3 year winter ... ... and how the dirty snow never stopped falling .
he saw the ocean , barren , poisoned , near death .
and how they watched the sky for 16 long years ... ... praying for the great lungs to start working again .
he said it was as if the ocean had breathed a great sigh of relief .
many commuters are abandoning their vehicles .

life' s but a walking shadow ... ... a poor player who struts ... ... and frets his hour upon a stage ... ... and is heard no more .

welcome , gentlemen , to your new life .
you have been born again as soldiers in the united army of nathan holn .
god rest his soul !
the strong have been sapped ... ... by the whimpering propaganda of the weak .
men ... ... strong men , have been denied their destiny .
you men have been saved from that fate .
redemption ... ... is within your grasp .
you .
what did you do before you were given this opportunity ?
i had a shovel .
i digged holes .
you digged holes .
now you' il fill them .
hi .
and you ?
me ?
is there any question in anyone' s mind that i was speaking to you ?
yes , you .
i' m just a performer .
shakespeare .
stuff like that .
shakespeare ?
he was a writer .
yes , i know .
i know who shakespeare was .
cry ' havoc ! ' ... ... and let slip ... ... the dogs of war .

that is the question .
we few ... ... we happy few ... ... we band of brothers !
now is the winter of our discontent made glorious summer ... ... by this sun of york .
no .
you' re pretty good .
you' re also a fighter .
i can see it in your eyes .
you are a dangerous man .
don' t you agree ?
no disrespect , sir , but you' d be better off letting me go .
a fighter is about the last thing that i am .
don' t you think i should be the judge of that , soldier ?
get up .
i said , get up !
you' re right .
you' re not a fighter .
but you will be .
i' m giving you a chance at a life ... ... that means something .
a life worth living .
i' m glad to see you .
we missed you .
i missed you .
kurt , how are you ?

friedrich' s teeth .

i tried to tell him .

words you said in town .
about the wind blowing and the rest .
say it again .
blow , wind .
come , wrack .
at least we' il die with the harness off our back .
what' s it mean ?
live free or ... ... die .
i think .
you' re going to watch a movie or you can sleep !
but tomorrow ... ... you run in uniform ... ... full packs ... ... 20 miles !
everybody makes it ... ... or nobody eats ... ... for the third day in a row !
everybody up .
you got meat tonight .
why don' t you tell shakespeare what kind it is ?
mule .
god awful animal .
sterile offspring of horse and donkey .
can you imagine that ?
there' s no room in the new world for a bastard like that .
any man last in line ain' t hungry enough to eat .
you show up last ... ... you don' t eat !
i' m going to die before i' m last in line again !
that' s what they' re hoping for .
shut up !
at least you' re eating !
you serious ?
good .
this is good !
you want this ? !
this is what you want ?
babies !
the hills are alive
with the sound of music
these were supposed to be the best years of my life .
halt .
the laws of eight , gentlemen .
that is the legacy handed down to us by nathan holn .
may he burn in hell .
these are the laws that we live by .
the 8 ... ... is our symbol .
each man will bear it with pride .
only then will you be part of the clan .
sit down , gentlemen .
you will obey orders without question .
i told you to sit .
there weren' t enough chairs .
i didn' t specify chairs .
you could' ve sat on the ground .
you disobeyed a direct order .
you broke ... ... law one .
punishment shall be swift .
mercy ... ... is for the weak .
terror ... ... will defeat reason .
your allegiance is to the clan .
justice can be dictated .
any clansmen may challenge for leadership of the clan .
does anyone wish to challenge me ?
on your feet .
there' s only one penalty .
death .
please !
i' m begging you !
you will get out of this army what you put into it .
work and you' il be fed .
fight and you' il be respected .
die and you' il be remembered .
you thinking of challenging for leadership ?
no , sir .
i' m a follower ... ... not a leader .
you got a smart mouth ... ... shakespeare .
you see colonel getty always following the general ?
he was the last man ever to challenge .
fight lasted 6 seconds ... ... but he didn' t kill him .
cut off his tongue ... ... then he cut off his balls .
and old getty' s been following him around like a dog ever since .
fall out !
the general don' t see it ... ... but i say you' ve got some nigger in you .
they' re yours ?
yes , sir .
a solitary man , aren' t you ?
binoculars to watch life from a distance and shakespeare ... ... to read about it , instead of living it .
no offense , but you seem to have read shakespeare ... ... yourself .
if he wishes to rise above mere thuggery ... ... a military commander must be classically educated ... ... philosophy and history , even a sense of the dramatic .
what do you think that i did before the war ?
do you think that i was in the army ?
i sold copying machines .
i was a salesman ... ... with the talent to lead men , devise and execute a battle plan ... ... locked away inside .
if nathan holn hadn' t come along , i' d still be selling copying machines .
can you imagine ... ... the wasted life ?
can you imagine the magnitude of that ?
but war ... ... war gives men like me a chance .
here .
the prize is often left unclaimed .
we must have the courage to grasp it ... ... for fortune always favors the bold .
he always inspires me .
i have a design for the future .
a master plan .
i will need able officers to help me carry it out .
you have the intelligence .
if your heart matches ... ... you will go far .
we' il talk more in weeks to come .
dismissed .
captain !
we' il be moving out tomorrow .
issue those binoculars to a scout .
and the book , sir ?
burn it .
quit moving !
what happened ?
what happened ?
what' d he say ?
nothing .
did he say anything about me ?
no !
i' m getting out of here .
what are you talking about ?
escaping .
what ? !
you ever hear of st. rose ?
it' s on the coast .
it' s a paradise .
we can' t .
we could !
between the 3 of us we could .
no .
i can' t .
i like it here .
i like being a part of something .
take a point !
some of the men shot a lion .
they crawled into the thicket .
one of you dogs earned a treat .
over there .
those men hunted a lion this morning .
must' ve been a goddamn zoo here before the war .
anyway , a third man went in after it .
we don' t know if he' s alive or dead .
i want a volunteer .
one of you is going in there after him .
i' il go .
i guess size ain' t a measure of courage .
is it ?
shakespeare .
i don' t think so , captain !
come out alive , you get a lion steak !
maybe you' il find your st. rose over there .
what the hell are you waiting for , christmas ?

this is going in my report .
these people don' t need dreams , mr. postman .
they need something real .
they need help with the holnists .
are you going to bring them that ?

all you cost us so far is a few bowls of soup and maybe a few broken hearts .
i aim to keep it that way .
you can stay here till morning ... ... then i don' t ever want to see you again .
benning .
portland .
boston " ?
these people

you' il be leaving tomorrow ?
i guess .
everybody' s up late writing letters for you to take .
they' re so excited .
and how about you ?
do you have a letter ?
i don' t have anybody to write to .
i' il find you a pen pal .
someone with similar interests .
you know ?
like dancing and ... ... checking for mumps .
you' re funny .
hardly anybody' s funny around here .
have you decided yet ?
been thinking about it .
sure .
i mean ... ... why not ?
god , you' re so ... .
you' re so ... ... beautiful .
i' m sorry , you probably want to keep things more clinical .
you don' t even know my name .
i don' t want to .
it would be easier for me ... ... if you closed your eyes .
we took a vote , mr. postman .
we want you to have this .
so you can' t say no .
i' il take it .
you got a bedroll , some oats and a week' s rations .
good .
thank you .
where will you go from here ?

times seem hard right now .
but you got to believe things are getting better .
birds are migrating again .
the rains are back .
stuff' s ... .
stuff' s getting better .
o beautiful
for spacious skies
for amber waves of grain
shit !
you' ve got a hell of a nerve , whoever you are .
did you see abby around this morning ?
this is as far as i go .
you' re on your own .
god shed his grace on thee
hey !
with brotherhood
are you really who you say you are ?
if i come back with some mail ... ... you' il know .
goddamn it !
what are you looking at ?
everything .
they don' t usually look at me .
who is responsible ... ... for that ?
i said ... ...
who' s responsible ... ... for that ? !
holnists , johnny .
you got to stay
you got to stay out of sight .
i' m a postman !
and i' m not running from anybody !

you' il be responsible .
now set that flag on fire .
throw it through the window of your post office .
do it , michael .
it' s all right , michael .
throw it .
the united states ... ... doesn' t exist !
that flag is an abomination !

i looked at it and it had a color to it .
good .
everything .
i was amazed .
it was ... .
good lord !
that , gentlemen ... ... is a first rate piece of ass .

she doesn' t belong in this mudhole .
excuse me .
you again !
that' s my wife , general .
she' s a married woman .
really ?
do you know what system of government we have here ?
we have what is known as a feudal system , like in the middle ages .
that' s lords and vassals .
that' s you and me .
now those lords ... ... they had some ideas .
they believed that if a vassal got married ... ... it was the lord' s right ... ... his right ... ... to sleep with the bride on the wedding night .
me and abby have been married 3 years .
i' m sorry , but i wasn' t invited to the wedding .
you' ve already done me one favor , son .
don' t let this be a black mark on an otherwise perfect record .
abby .
we' il be civilized about this .
i want you to give me your blessing .
sir , i can' t .
you can' t ?
you can' t .
can' t .
we had a great nation once .
know what made it great ?
i can .
till the weak came along .
the " i can' ts " destroyed us !
i' m going to make us strong again .
i' m going to be the father ... ... of a new nation .
and do you know why ... ... it will be me ?
because i can .
michael !
stop it !
you' re killing him !
let me go !
please , let me go !
help him , somebody !

they say this army is illegal .
and they say drop dead !
and go to hell !
