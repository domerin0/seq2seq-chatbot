fairy tales tell , as their labels imply , stories of magic , of creatures that fly .
with giants and dragons and ogres and elves , and inanimate objects that speak for themselves .
d strange magic d oh , what a strange magic d oh , it' s a strange magic d got a strange magic d got a strange magic
there' s romance and danger and plotting of schemes .
there' s good guys and bad guys and some guys in between .
a fairy tale also reveals some sort of truth , the perils of choices we face in our youth .
but our story today is different in theme , for our hero had no choice , or so it would seem .
d strange magic
it starts with a fairy bestowing a spell .
this one' s for a baby named ella of frell . d got a strange magic d got a strange magic
now , now , ella .
mother' s here .
there , now .
oh , dear ella .
oh , it' s nothing a little burping won' t cure .
up .
there , now .
come on .
all the way .
i gotta work on that .
whoa !
hello , ladies !
lucinda !
she gives the worst gifts .
not if she can' t find the baby .
whoa !
ah !
lucinda here .
fairy par excellence .
now , where' s the baby ?
out walking .
at her grandmother' s .
at her grandmother' s .
out for a walk .
she' s walking , at her grandmother' s .
either way , as you see , she' s not here .
oh , look .
she' s back .
all right .
what shall we give this beautiful little child today ?
what' s her name again ?
ella .
ah .
ella of frell .
not a very well behaved little stinker , is she ?
quiet , please .
i can' t concentrate here .
ella of frell , i give you the gift of obedience .
now , go to sleep .
now , wake up .
lsn' t it wonderful ?
no , it' s terrible .
it' s a terrible gift to have to do what you' re told .
take it back .
i have a no return policy .
and if you' re going to be ungrateful , i can always turn her into a squirrel instead .
a squirrel ?
no , obedience is a lovely gift .
besides , you should thank me .
i' ve just given you the perfect child .
ln spite of the spell , ella grew up strong of mind .
her gift made her obedient , but her heart made her kind .
why don' t you go back to where you came from ?
yeah .
areida .
what a stupid name .
nobody wants you here .
i do .
bite me .
did you just see what ella did ?
i made your favorite , so dig in and stuff your face .
i' m gonna get forks .
sweetie , stop .
i always knew something was wrong with me .
can' t you take the spell back ?
you' re a fairy .
i' m only a household fairy , honey .
besides , according to fairy guidelines , only the fairy who gave you the gift can take it back , and we' ve begged her .
not only that , but she said she' d turn your mother into a squirrel and take away my eternal youth if we ever asked her again .
it' s not fair .
i know , darling .
i know .
so ella now knew why she' d always obeyed .
but she never stopped fighting to have things her way .
ella !
come practice your mandolin .
fine , but i' il take my own sweet time doing it .
hurry up , now .
as she struggled to find a way out of her gift , she had no way of knowing something worse was adrift .
please get well , mother .
listen to me .
only mandy and i know about the gift .
we' ve never even told your father .
and you must never tell anyone else .
i don' t want anyone using it against you .
mother , please .
remember , no matter what anyone says or tells you to do ,
look to yourself , ella .
what' s inside you is stronger than any spell .
take this , then i' il always be with you .
d a strange magic d strange magic d a strange magic
ella .
your father would like to speak to you .
you' re married ?
she has money , ella .
and she' s very fond of my title .
it was either get married or sell the house .
you' il adore dame olga , and her two daughters .
she' il make a wonderful mother .
well , a motherlike figure .
look , i' m sure you' il all be the best of friends .
whoa !
ls this the right address ?
there must be some mistake .
my dear , welcome .
and these must be your lovely daughters .
my precious hattie and my special olive .
oh .
and you must be ella .
pleased to meet you .
yes .
the house looks delightful .
but i do seem to remember that at the noblemen' s convention you said that you lived in a castle .
no , i said a man' s home is his castle .
hi .
i' m ella .
welcome to frell .
what' s with the prince pinups ?
hattie' s president of the prince char fan club .
char and his uncle are responsible for the segregation of the kingdom .
so ?
he' s dreamy .
ls this hutch meant to be a closet ?
it' s pathetic .
my clothes need more room than this .
we' il have to use yours .
wha ... ?
show it to us .
oh .
it' s so ... quaint .
almost like , well , it' s just ugly , isn' t it ?
there' s no room in here , either .
we' re gonna have to throw out some of your gowns to make room .
wait .
get away from there !
you get away .
oh .
what' s this ?
i do actually like this .
please don' t touch it .
it was my mother' s .
can i have it ?
no .
oh .
it can be your welcome gift to me .
come on , hand it over .
oh .
aren' t you accommodating .
the second i sell the last of these , i' il be back .
i promise .
i know it' s not a great job , not even a good job
ok , even a monkey could do it but we need the money , ella .
i' il miss you , father .
i' il miss you , too .
hey , olive , we should call her ella the smella from frella .
elves , giants , ogres and humans used to exist in harmony , but when king florian was killed , allegedly by an ogre ,
sir edgar saw it as an opportunity to exile all nonhuman creatures to the forest , keeping their land for himself .
passionately put , ella .
give yourself a pat on the back .
hattie ?
oh .
what my unworthy opponent fails to realize is sir edgar has done a fantastic job .
he has driven the ogres out , and he has put giants and elves to work as laborers and entertainers .
therefore , if it weren' t for him , we wouldn' t have today' s thriving free enterprise system .
it' s only free because we' ve enslaved the poor creatures and they work for nothing .
edgar is a monster , and i don' t hold out much hope for his nephew , either .
well , that shows what you know , aka nothing .
prince char will be the greatest king ever .
right , girls ?
yeah .
i wonder if my opponent has based her opinion on the prince' s politics or how cute she thinks his butt is .
admit you' re stupid and don' t know what you' re talking about .
i' m stupid and i don' t know what i' m talking about .
ella ?
anyway , in conclusion ...
hold your tongue , ella .
ella !
my tongue itches .
lf you' re not going to take this seriously , i declare hattie the winner .
ya !
uncle , do i have to go to this mall opening ?
as heir to the throne , it' s your royal responsibility , char .
you are a public figure , after all .
yes , but you' re the one in charge .
only for a little while longer .
your coronation is next week .
you need to be out there with the people , char .
yes , shaking hands and kissing babies .
exactly , heston .
so the people can learn to trust us .
what' s not to trust ?
nothing .
but while you' ve been away at school , char , the kingdom has been under siege .
ln your absence , the ogres have become impossible .
he' s right .
even the giants have become more and more treacherous .
but the giants have always been peaceful .
the ogres were peaceful too , until they ripped your father to shreds .
and i promised your father , should anything happen to him ,
i would take care of you and the kingdom .
and , well , i' ve kept my promise , haven' t l ?
whoa !
likewise , you must keep your promise to the people .
now , let' s put on a smile .
remember , image is everything .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
it' s wonderful to be here in your charming town of ...
frell .
prince charmont and i ...
we want char !
we want char !
we want char !
we want char !
we want char !
now it is my great pleasure to welcome my nephew , prince charmont .
say no to ogrecide !
stop the giant land grab !
say no to ogrecide !
stop the giant land grab !
say no to ogrecide !
stop the giant land grab !
say no to ogrecide !
ella !
you are embarrassing us !
go home now .
i have to go .
i' m sorry .
i love you , prince char !
hey !
prince char !
are you a fast runner ?
not particularly , no .
why ?
get him !
d i' m walking on sunshine d whoa oh d i' m walking on sunshine d whoa oh
ow !
shush , shush , shush !
d and don' t it feel good ?
prince charmont .
please , call me ... call me char .
sorry about that .
occupational hazard .
allow me .
i don' t need your chivalry , thanks .
and i' ve no intention of curtsying , either , so forget it .
you can curtsy or not .
that' s your choice .
there' s really nothing i can do about it .
except have you beheaded , but that seems a bit extreme .
charming .
why don' t you do what your people usually do ?
steal my land and destroy my livelihood .
lf you' il excuse me ...
wait a second .
come back here .
hm ?
what is your name ?
ella of frell .
well , ella of frell , you' re the first maiden i' ve met who hasn' t swooned at the sight of me .
then maybe i' ve done you some good .
look , i' ve never stolen anyone' s land or livelihood .
i want peace in the kingdom as much as anyone .
so you have a new plan once you take the crown ?
well ...
sort of .
of course , i couldn' t reveal it to a subject .
that' s what i thought .
you' re all just the same .
you care more about your fan club and your next jousting tournament .
no , actually , i' ve never been comfortable with the whole adoring fan club thing .
perhaps that' s why i find your obvious disdain for me so refreshing .
obvious ?
and i was trying so hard to hide it .
where' s my purse ?
it' s back there .
wait right there .
i will get it .
prince charmont !
prince charmont !
your highness .
are you crazy ?
why didn' t you move ?
i would have ... were it not for your apparent fascination with knocking me to the ground .
that' s the second time today , you realize .
i' il try and be more considerate next time i' m saving you .
next time ?
what makes you think we' il see each other again ?
well , won' t we ?
no .
ella of frell , you are not like other girls .
you have no idea .
ella , come here .
shouldn' t you be at home cleaning the fireplace , huh ?
stop flirting with him .
it' s me he' s going to have at his coronation .
yeah , in the middle of the table with an apple in your mouth .
go back to the mall with olive .
ella .
oh .
don' t bother with her .
ugh .
i' m the one you want .
i know everything about you .
i' ve got posters of you , and pictures .
and when we used to live in lamia ,
i used to stand outside your castle and watch you turn your lights on and off .
tell ella i' il be in touch .
right .
i' il see to that .
where were you ?
oh .
i met the prince .
you met the prince ?
i don' t wanna talk about it .
olive and hattie were there .
hattie .
why do you always do what hattie tells you to do ?
i don' t .
yes , you do .
i don' t .
tell the truth .
oh , i do .
olive , have you noticed anything strange about ella ?
no , not really .
have you noticed it gets darker at night , then lighter when the sun comes up ?
that' s because of ella ?
never mind .
you' ve been acting odd , even for you .
what do you mean ?
oh ...
don' t let her see me .
that' s what i mean .
aha .
areida , no !
ella , come here .
i have to go .
what ?
i need you to do me a little favor .
take that .
cool !
let me try !
take that .
and that potion bottle .
ok !
ok , that' s enough .
i think that' s for me to say , ella .
we need one more thing .
take those .
please don' t make me do this .
well , since you said please ...
no .
take them .
take them !
run !
stop that girl !
buy a squirrel sandwich .
get ' em while they' re hot .
here .
keep the change .
excuse me .
excuse me .
coming through .
try our new perfume .
thanks .
get out of the way !
get out of the way !
ella , bravo !
freeze !
put your hands together .
you' re under arrest .
a felon in my own family .
i could die from embarrassment .
promises , promises .
you are a disgrace .
maybe she was put up to it .
mandy' s right , mother .
we were there .
it really wasn' t poor ella' s fault at all .
she was forced to do it .
so , ella , who put you up to it ?
tell her it was areida .
ar ...
i' m waiting .
tell me who' s to blame .
areida .
areida !
i might have guessed it .
you are forbidden ever to see her again .
what ?
ella ?
how dare she come here now ?
answer the door and tell her that you never want to see her again .
and tell her you could never be friends with an ayorthian .
dame olga , there must be some mistake .
please , dame olga .
don' t argue .
just do it .
thank goodness you' re all right .
what' s wrong ?
i never wanna see you again .
ha ha .
very funny .
i don' t understand .
we' re best friends .
i could never be friends with an ayorthian .
just go .
i' ve done terrible things before , mandy , but this is the worst thing the curse has ever made me do .
i' ve gotta do it .
i have got to find lucinda and get her to take back the curse .
you' re right .
i have something to show you .
this is gonna help you find her .
i should have told you about this years ago .
but i was a little embarrassed .
embarrassed ?
how ?
well , as you know , i' m not the most talented fairy .
anyway , this book ... is my boyfriend , benny .
hey .
pleased to meet you .
pleased to meet anyone , quite frankly .
you' re the first introduction i' ve had in 20 years .
i' ve never seen anything like this .
i know .
no one has .
and i don' t want them to , cos then they might take him away .
it was an accident .
i was just trying a spell to trim his hair , and it went a little askew .
i would have left her ages ago , except i love her so darn much .
plus , i have no legs .
i love you , too , my little pooky pages .
not as much as i love you , cuddlebuns .
i love you more .
ok .
lots of love .
moving on .
well , i want you to take him with you .
you mean i' m getting out of here ?
beyond these four walls ?
there are so many places in my pages i' ve been wanting to visit .
wow .
what is all this ?
he knows everything .
thanks , sweetie , but not everything .
lf i did , i' d be a lot thicker .
can he show me anything about lucinda ?
can i show you anything about lucinda ?
watch this .
show me lucinda .
ta da !
cool trick .
now , which crockery barn ?
they' re all over the kingdom .
ah .
that' s the glitch .
he can' t tell you where a person is .
he can just show you pictures .
like a crystal ball or a magic mirror .
everything is so huge .
ls that a wedding registry ?
duh !
they' re in giantville .
look , she' s going to a wedding in giantville .
benny , we' re going to giantville .
how exciting .
ella , the girls and i need bouquets for our portrait sitting tomorrow .
go and pick some .
d what you want , baby , i got it d what you need , cos you know i got it d all i' m asking is for a little respect when you get home , baby
oh , my god !
so , as her stepfamily scratched their newly found itches ,
ella was off , glad to be rid of the ... witches .
benny , can you show me a map of the forest of pim ?
of course .
whoa .
according to this map , if we head due east towards monster rock , we can cut half a day off our journey .
what was that ?
probably something that wants to eat us .
ouch !
somebody help me !
wait a minute .
sing soprano , little man !
missed !
what do you think you' re doing to that poor elf ?
oh .
who' s this who thinks she' s so tough ?
look , i think it' s only fair to warn you that i' m practiced in the ancient art ... of origami .
paper folding ?
i was hoping you wouldn' t know what that was .
don' t let him scare you , sweetheart !
kick his butt !
don' t let her do that .
now rabbit punch .
combo .
kneel .
front step kick .
dragon roundhouse kick .
this chick is nuts !
let' s get outta here .
i think i' m gonna puke .
let me help you with that .
i am gonna need so much therapy after this .
oh !
are you ok ?
no , i am not ok !
i think i broke something , or dislocated it , or ...
no , just a crick .
slannen of pim .
ella of frell .
nice to meet you .
well , if you' re ok , then i have to be going , but good luck .
you' re going ?
you can' t walk in this wood on your own .
how about a bite to eat ?
that' s very sweet , but i' m on a tight schedule .
fine .
message received , miss " i think i' m all that " .
that' s not what i meant at all .
i extend the hand of friendship ...
i am on a tight schedule .
were i not ...
everybody' s busy ...
.. l would love to have dinner with you .
great !
i' ve got a coupon .
slannen .

get outta here !
i need this .
what is this , anyway ?
ella' s secret diary .
yes .
why don' t you like music ?
that' s right .
because elves are supposed to be so happy and joyful all the time .
singing and dancing for the man .
i don' t wanna be an entertainer .
i wanna be a ...
what ?
nothing .
what were you gonna say ?
it' s silly .
please tell me .
i wanna be a lawyer .
i guess in small claims court .
what is that ?
nothing .
why can' t you be a lawyer ?
hello ?
elf .
i forgot .
the elfin restrictions sir edgar passed .
no elf shall be engaged in any occupation other than singing , juggling andlor tomfoolery .
they' re never gonna let me go to law school .
i' m never gonna get my day in court , never gonna stand in front of the judge and say
you' re out of order !
permission to approach the bench ?
" i object !
no , i object .
i heard it there .
it' s coming from the book .
no , it' s not .
yes , it is .
no , it' s not .
great .
i knew it .
a talking book .
good .
because for a minute there , i thought i was going crazy . d crazy d i' m crazy for feeling so lonely
what are you doing with ella' s things ?
just a little tidying up .
what' s that ?
what ?
nothing .
it' s personal .
a letter for ella ?
the prince' s coronation ball .
he' s invited that insolent little snip ?
girls , go and dust off your ball gowns and pack your bags .
i think i may have found you another chance at your future husband .
yes !
so you can really show me anything anywhere in the kingdom ?
you' re kind of like a walking , talking encyclopedia , except for the walking part .
come on .
what ?
what' s going on ?
edgar' s soldiers rounding up elfin singers to perform at the coronation .
get in .
and you .
slannen , you' ve gotta go to lamia and petition the prince .
for what ?
to go to law school .
you gotta stop this . d the sun will shine you want me to go to lamia on my own ?
we' re going to giantville .
it' s on the way .
come with us .
the prince will never grant an audience with an elf .
they think we' re a joke .
i have met prince charmont , and i think he might be different than his uncle .
why ?
cos he' s a hunk ?
no .
what is he , about six foot ?
about .
yeah , i hate the guy already .
i' m not wasting my time .
lacking courage as well as height .
count me in .
elves aren' t that short , you know .
that' s just a myth created by that stupid elves and the shoemaker story .
do i look small enough to fit in a shoe ?
no .
stinking grimm brothers .
are you sure he knows where he' s going ?
hey , i' m right here .
just cos i' m a book doesn' t mean i don' t have ears .
boys , if you can' t play nice , you can' t play together .
oh , no .
the rustling always comes before the screaming and the running .
i knew this was gonna happen .
they' il just find pieces of us scattered across the forest floor .
oh , a bunny .
you know , the last known case of a bunny attack was , well , never .
it never hurts to be on your guard .
nobody panic , nobody panic .
i' ve got this in hand .
oi !
you !
thumper !
out of the forest or no more carrots for you .
i don' t like carrots .
how do you feel about rabbits , cos one just went thataway .
i am the ogre , nish .
how do you like to be eaten ?
baked , boiled , shish kebabbed ?
how about free range ?
stop !
no !
ella of frell .
hi , how are you doing ?
i think there' s been a big mistake here .
see , i' m pro ogre .
pro ogre ?
absolutely .
i led a rally on your behalf the other day .
maybe you heard about it .
it' il only hurt for a moment , i promise .
i' m a fast eater .
slannen , slannen !
please , i want to help .
help ?
from a human ?
humans took everything from us .
i was an ogre of leisure , with a simple life .
next thing you know ...
now , not this again .
nish , hurry up .
i' m starving .
right , you , into the pot .
forget that .
who are you ?
i am the ogre , nish .
we just did this .
didn' t we just do this ?
all right , that' s enough fun and games .
now , keep your mouth shut and don' t move .
ls it boiling yet ?
it' s not gonna boil if you stand there looking at it .
you couldn' t show a picture of a big ogre heading our way ?
that would have been helpful .
oh !
oh !
i think i see bubbles .
let her go !
untie yourself .
truce !
truce !
can' t we just get along ?
are you one of the monsters who killed my father ?
king florian was a good man .
we lived in peace during his reign .
why would we kill him ?
i' il spare your lives where you didn' t spare his .
you take your friends and find breakfast elsewhere .
we' il pick up something else on the way .
anyway , you eat maiden , an hour later you' re hungry again .
what are you doing here , with an elf for protection ?
do you get a kick out of near death experiences ?
no .
i was fine .
i had things well in hand .
i could see that , as you were dangling over the boiling cauldron , no doubt lulling the ogres into a false sense of security .
who' s to say it wouldn' t have worked if you hadn' t come barging in ?
i see the score currently stands at chivalry two , gratitude zero .
look ...
you' re right .
i' m sorry .
thank you .
you' re welcome .
you' re bleeding .
hm ?
oh , it' s just a scratch .
you' d better let me help you with that .
so , will i live ?
i think the odds are in your favor .
so ... where were you headed ?
the giants ' village for a wedding .
i' m meeting my godmother .
that' s on our way back to lamia .
we' il accompany you .
that' s not necessary .
it makes it so much easier rescuing you if i don' t have to commute .
i' m so glad i was here for this interesting development .
look , i really appreciate the offer , but ...
are you crazy ?
tell him to come with us .
come with us .
so , traveling with an elf ?
your boyfriend couldn' t make it ?
no .
oh .
because i don' t have one .
oh .
your girlfriend doesn' t mind being left alone ?
i don' t have a girlfriend .
oh ?
i have many .
oh .
i' m kidding .
shouldn' t believe everything you read in medieval teen .
excuse me .
excuse me .
prince charmont , permission to speak ?
sure .
you know the word coincidence ?
it just so happens i was on my way to meet a certain royal someone in order to discuss some career options currently unavailable to ...
slannen wants to petition the kingdom for the right to become a lawyer .
a lawyer ?
why not ?
there were no laws against it when your father was king .
that' s not really my area of expertise .
my advice to you would be to talk to my uncle .
i' m sure if you make a good argument , he' il come round .
well , thank you for your ... advice .
what ?
you' re about to become king .
you' il have the power to make a difference in the world and you don' t even care .
it' s not like i asked to become king .
i' ve had no say in the matter .
well , thanks to your uncle , there are a lot of people who have no say in the matter .
nobody should be forced to do things they don' t wanna do .
take it from somebody who knows .
ella !
ella !
you' re not finished yet .
you work until sundown .
the giants have always been gentle .
why are they treated like slaves ?
i' m sure my uncle doesn' t know about this .
he couldn' t .
maybe you can get to the bottom of this at the wedding .
maybe you can find your godmother .
whoa .
they' re not so bad .
i thought they' d be all so big and scary .
didn' t hurt .
i hope this is a good idea .
they must hate the royal family .
they' il respect your courage at showing up here .
besides , they don' t hold grudges .
they' re bigger than that .
prince charmont .
what are you doing here ?
no grudges , eh ?
well , i thought that maybe this would be a good time to possibly have a heart to heart .
but now i' m thinking i should come back when there' s been a little less drinking .
he' s here as a friend to hear your complaints .
then welcome .
i' m looking for someone .
my godmother , lucinda .
she was over there earlier .
thank you .
i' il be right back .
excuse me . ls lucinda perriweather here ?
too late , sweetheart .
she left about an hour ago .
do you know where i can find her ?
last i heard , she was somewhere living in lamia .
do you know where the bathroom is ?
benny , show me lucinda .
looks like she' s getting an fwl .
fwl ?
flying while intoxicated .
she could be anywhere .
ow !
sorry .
agh !
ooh .
i' d no idea things were so bad .
i promise , first thing after my coronation , i' il help you buy your farms back .
i' il hold you to that .
i' m sorry to interrupt .
no problem .
we were done .
that' s a fine young man you have here .
he' s not fine .
i mean , mine .
he is fine ...
never mind .
so have you seen slannen ?
we have to leave .
my godmother' s on some kind of bender .
you can' t leave now .
it' s the middle of the night .

i love singers .
really ?
because , you know , being an elf , i love to sing .
you know , i hope you don' t mind me saying this , but you' re much prettier than i would have expected .
oh , i know .
giants are supposed to be big , ugly and mean .
it' s because of stories like jack and the beanstalk .
stinking grimm brothers .
i' ve seen weirder couples .
none that immediately come to mind , but still .
my stepsister hattie would die if she knew i was here .
she' s the president of your fan club , you know .
oh , hattie , yes .
thank you .
now i know what name to put on the restraining order .
no , you' re lucky .
i wish i had brothers and sisters .
my mother passed away before she had any more children and ...
my mother passed away , too .
oh .
you know , she used to sing me to sleep every night .
my father used to sing to me , loudly and very off key , but ...
i still miss him .
i have edgar , i guess .
he' s not such a bad guy .
he risked his life to save my father .
and he brought me up as his own son .
i know you don' t like his politics much , but i' m sure when i tell him about the giants , he will correct the situation .
yeah , or you could .
it took a lot of guts for you to come here .
look at the way you smoothed things over .
you' re a natural at this .
wow , is that almost a compliment ?
almost .
now , don' t go getting a big head .
your crown won' t fit .
you know what else ?
tomorrow i' m gonna go to my uncle and i' m gonna ask him to repeal the elfin restrictions .
slannen will have his day in court , if i have anything to say about it .
i think you' re gonna be a great king someday .
your father would have been proud .
thanks .
i think he would have really liked you .
kiss me .
that wasn' t an order , you know .
i know .
i want to look 25 at tonight' s ball .
what do you suggest ?
a time machine ?
may i recommend our newest procedure ?
bat faeces and oxen blood .
batox .
works wonders , although i do caution you , some people have a temporarily bad reaction .
olga .
peter , what are you doing here ?
i' m in town on business and heard you were here .
i came to see ella .
ls ella here ?
of course .
where else would she be ?
she' s ... she' s ... with hattie and olive , taking a tour of the castle .
next we move into the castle lobby .
i can' t believe it .
prince char walked on this actual floor !
ladies , ladies , ladies !
stop tonguing the foyer .
show us where char showers .
i bet he showers naked !
hold it , pipsqueak .
i' m with the prince .
and i' m not that short .
are you singing at the coronation ?
heck , no .
no elves in the palace unless they' re performing .
discrimination . lntentional infliction of ...
whoa !
.. bodily harm .
these portraits were recently commissioned in honor of tomorrow' s coronation .
right , follow me .
what are they doing here ?
i don' t mean to rush , but now i really need to find my godmother , and slannen , too .
where is he ?
my uncle' il send the guards to find him .
everything' s gonna be fine .
don' t forget , you are with the future king .
char .
hello , uncle .
i' ve been looking all over for you .
and who might this charming young lady be ?
this is ella .
ella of frell .
ella , this is my uncle edgar .
and this is his ...
heston .
hey .
so , i trust your journey was pleasant ?
we had a little run in with some ogres , but char got the best of them .
you could have been killed .
ah , well .
one just has to grin and bear it , i always say .
grin and bear it .
so , char , might i trouble you for a moment ?
the crown maker needs to see you in your chambers for a fitting .
sure .
i just have to take ella to the ... to the hall of records .
yes , well , hop to it , then , both of you .
you were right about that girl .
very odd .
and i' m afraid she' s been filling our prince' s head with dangerous new thoughts .
here' s the latest census .
names are listed first by location then species .
good luck .
thank you .
sorry i couldn' t be of more help , but i don' t have a census .
i mean , look at the size of that thing .
i do have a restaurant guide .
lucinda , i hope you' re in here .
ella has lots of interesting opinions about the kingdom , uncle .
you should hear them .
i can' t wait .
the giants ' working conditions , for instance .
they' re unbelievable .
luckily , i' ve talked to them and they' re definitely open for negotiation .
the only negotiations between me and the giants will be over our vegetable deliveries .
good one , sire .
this isn' t a joke , uncle edgar .
we' il talk about it after your coronation , yes ?
fine , but we will talk .
of course .
i ...
i' m going to ask her to marry me .
who ?
this ... this ella of frell ?
yes .
tonight , at the ball .
at the same time and in the same place as my father proposed to my mother .
get off !
do you know who i am ?
come with me .
what now ?
get off !
get off me !
so , ella of frell is your sister .
stepsister , actually .
really ?
tell me , what do you know about her ?
what' s in it for me ?
how about that your eyeballs remain inside your head ?
now , now , heston .
we like these girls .
they' re our friends .
i can' t find anything in any of these books .
benny , show me lucinda .
no , still sacked out .
i don' t know where else to ...
dun flyin retirement community for faeries ?
why don' t we just cut to the chase , hm ?
i might even be willing to throw prince char into the deal .
let' s see , now .
after the coronation he' il need to take a queen , and shall we say ... his hand in marriage ?
queen olive .
for the eldest daughter , of course .
ella does everything she' s told .
i don' t know why , but she does .
she can' t help it .
lucinda perriweather ,
dun flyin retirement community for faeries , lamia heights .
benny !
benny , we got her .
hello , ella .
i hope you' ve found everything to your satisfaction ?
yes , thank you .
good , good .
oh , dear .
how clumsy of me .
pick it up .
very good .
now touch your toes .
oh , no .
oh , yes .
and while you' re about it , why don' t you pat your head and rub your tummy at the same time ?
now jump up and down .
please stop .
wait .
perhaps you know this one . d put your left foot in , your left foot out d put your left foot in and shake it all about d shake , shake , shake , shake , shake , shake d shake your booty , shake your booty
this is fabulous !
hate to be a party pooper , but , edgar , evil plans , remember ?
yes , you' re right .
ok , stop .
as you know , tonight is the coronation ball .
at some point , amidst your frolicking and romancing ,
prince char will sweep you away to the hall of mirrors .
then , just before midnight , he will take you by the hand and ask you a question .
how do you know all this ?
we know everything , my dear .
and the one thing we know with most certainty is that at the stroke of midnight you will take this dagger and plunge it through his heart and kill him .
no !
no , i won' t !
oh , yes , you will .
you will , because i order you to .
actually , it' s lucky you' re here , so i won' t have to do it myself .
you' d kill your own nephew ?
why not ?
i killed my own brother .
what ?
why ?
i want to be king .
duh !
now go .
wait .
there' s one more thing .
you will tell no one of this plan .
can i help you ?
i' m looking for lucinda perriweather .
it' s kind of urgent .
sorry .
she was kicked out last week .
do you know where i could find her ?
nope .
you don' t understand . lf i don' t find her , something terrible' s going to happen .
finding her would be something terrible .
dear char .
this is the hardest thing i' ve ever had to do , and i hope you' il understand .
we can' t be together .
i can' t tell you why .
please believe that this is the only solution .
i wish you the best .
i really do believe you' re going to be a great king .
goodbye for ever .
ella .
now , if she stayed clear of the prince until midnight had passed , then char would be safe .
but how long could that last ?
slannen , where have you been ?
what are you doing ?
never mind .
this may sound strange , but there' s something i need you to do .
you are one freaky chick .
i need you to go back into the forest and rally all the elves and giants you can find .
you want me to go back in there ?
you' il need all the help you can get .
someone has to get into the castle , find benny and keep char away from edgar .
why ?
what' s going on ?
i already told you , i can' t tell you .
but if you don' t , you might very well be stuck singing " kumbaya " the rest of your life .
fine ! lnto the forest of certain death walks slannen .
thank you .
yeah , whatever .
where' s your little friend ?
yes .
she should be here by now .
i don' t want to talk about her .
agh !
oh !
oh !
oh !
slannen , please hurry .
would you stop that ?
when you steal from here , you are stealing from me now .
what do you mean ?
this is my future home , isn' t it ?
oh .
hi .
i was just polishing ...
would you ... would you care to dance ?
are you kidding ?
that' s all she ever talks about .
you wanted to look younger .
lf you spent less time on your face and more on your maternal duties , we' d know where ella was right now .
ouch !
whoa !
what the ... ?
this isn' t the salad bar at brelly' s .
lucinda .
lucinda !
lucinda !
oh , my goodness .
do i know you , child ?
ella of frell .
you gave me a gift .
oh , yes .
i remember you .
the obedient one .
i am so happy to see you .
i have been looking everywhere for you .
i need you to take the gift back .
take it back ?
i don' t think so .
it' s not that i' m not grateful for the gift .
i am , really .
but because of the gift ,
i' m about to do something horrible to this guy i really like and might even love .
girl , you out of your mind .
everybody loves my gifts .
lucinda !
lucinda , i am begging you .
i will do anything you ask .
please take it back .
you don' t like my gift ?
fine .
get rid of it yourself .
don' t blame me for your problems .
did i chain your butt up to this tree , huh ?
well ...
huh ?
but you ...
no .
and , in fact , just to prove what a gem i am ...
i' il unchain you .
what ?
no !
no !
aren' t i fabulous ?
now , look at you .
a pretty girl like you should be at the ball .
what ?
go get down with the prince .
no , i can' t go !
well , not dressed like that .
now , that' s what i' m talking about .
ok , that hurt .
give , give , give .
you' re welcome .
tell me about your sister .
olive ? ldiot .
no , ella .
oh .
i don' t wanna talk about her .
she' s so dreary .
i just wanna talk about us .
us ?
it sounds even more wonderful when you say it .
ow !
something tells me she just couldn' t stay away .
we need to talk .
char , please ...
please tell me you never wanna see me again .
i will if you tell me that you don' t love me .
it' s not that .
then why did you write me that letter ?
tell me how you really feel about me .
i love you .
but i am wrong for you , char .
i am wrong for the kingdom .
ls that what this is about ?
ella , that' s crazy .
come with me .
the hall of mirrors ?
when i was little , my father brought me in here .
he told me to look in the mirror and see myself as a great leader .
somehow , i never could .
and then you come along .
ella , what' s wrong ?
i wish i could tell you .
i wish i could tell you everything .
these last few days have been so perfect .
well , except for the bit where we almost got eaten by ogres .
and you wrote me a letter that ripped my heart out .
and i had to dance with hattie .
but none of these things matter .
we' re together now .
and when we' re together , it' s like magic .
i never want it to end .
i know , i know .
and i feel the same , but ...
that' s why i brought you here .
char , please listen to me .
ella , i know .
you' re scared .
i' m scared , too .
this is ... this is a big step .
ella ...
ella of frell , will you marry me ?
no , no , no , no , no !
no ?
no .
i don' t understand .
what is it ?
my politics ?
your family ?
because those things aren' t important .
what' s important is what' s in our hearts .
lf our love is strong , we can conquer anything .
i do love you , char .
ella , come here .
don' t argue .
just do it .
take that .
keep your mouth shut .
take those .
don' t move .
on the stroke of midnight you will take this dagger and plunge it through his heart and kill him .
what' s inside you is stronger than any spell .
you will no longer be obedient .
you will no longer be obedient !
i' m free .
i can' t believe it .
i' m free .
you tried to kill me .
guards !
no , char ...
take her away .
no , char , please .
please , char , wait .
no , char !
char , please , wait .
i can explain !
please listen to me !
char !
no , please .
no !
no !
there' s been a huge mistake .
please .
just listen .
please !
you realize , of course , she' il have to be put to death immediately .
i just don' t understand .
maybe i should go and talk to her .
no .
no , i forbid you to go down there .
your highness , your uncle didn' t want to frighten you , but the secret police informed us of a possible uprising .
those ogres in the forest , they were after you .
the girl was obviously part of the scheme .
the ogres never planned to hurt her .
she was just toying with your emotions , char , so she could get close to you and commit the murder herself .
i ...
i just don' t believe it .
yes .
yes , it does seem quite fantastic .
you let me worry about all this , hm ?
you just concentrate on tomorrow' s coronation .
sire , you know i' ve been working with the red guard .
why not call them in now and take over the whole kingdom like we planned ?
first we must find a way to get rid of the prince .
and i think i have a pretty good idea how to do it .
all right .
we just have to find a way to get past those guards .
help !
please , somebody get me out of here !
benny ?
what' s he doing here ?
ugh !
slannen , you' ve saved my life .
are you ok ?
i could kiss you .
i think a nice thank you note is enough .
i think ella' s in trouble .
something to do with edgar .
we have to find her .
show me ella .
edgar' s done this ?
we' ve gotta go in there and stop him .
it' il take courage , bravery ...
i was gonna ask you how you' d like to be eaten , but if it' s edgar you' re after ... count us in .
welcome aboard .
executioner coming through .
enter .
help .
i wouldn' t do that if i were you .
open up .
i' m miss frell' s legal representation .
her what ?
her lawyer , numbskull .
lf the gauntlet doesn' t fit , you must acquit .
now , open this door before i sue you for everything you own .
now , move it !
come on !
come on !
thank you .
slannen of pim is not an elf easily drawn into a legal battle , but when faced with a challenge to equality , freedom and civil liberties , this elf will draw the sword of justice .
and , furthermore ...
excuse me , what is going on here ?
well , can we at least take him to go ?
put the nice man down .
slannen ?
ella ?
ella !
slannen !
oh , ella !
benny !
are you ok ?
i' m fine , but char might not be .
show me edgar .
that' s char' s crown .
he' s poisoned it .
we gotta go .
come on .
come on , guys .
we got a coronation to crash .
people of lamia .
today is a very special day for our kingdom .
for today you are here to witness the crowning of a king .
bring in the crown .
drop that crown !
ella ?
seize them !
it' s payback time .
charge !
char !
kill them , and anyone who gets in your way .
oh , my god !
no !
no , no , no , no !
i can' t believe i' m saving you , after you tried to kill me .
i didn' t try to kill you .
you get away from her !
take this !
hey !
that dagger you were about to plunge into my back was an early wedding present ?
hello !
help !
mandy !
help !
fairies in kingdoms across the land , please help me turn benny back into a man .
a pumpkin ?
ok , maybe i did try to kill you , but that wasn' t me .
what ?
maybe it was me , but it wasn' t my fault .
then edgar found out about the curse and he ordered me to kill you .
so i had to break up with you , even though i' m pretty sure that you' re the best thing that' s ever happened to me .
that crown he' s about to put on your head , it' s poisoned .
duck .
whoa .
edgar' s trying to kill me ?
yes .
hold on .
how vulgar !
excuse me .
thank you .
char , there' s one more thing .
he killed your father .
what ?
that can' t be true .
well , of course it' s not true .
who are you gonna believe ?
this lying little twit , or the man who raised you ?
he tried to kill char !
get him !
uh oh .
well , i guess that answers that question .
you vile little girl .
i should have disposed of you when i had the chance .
you almost destroyed this kingdom .
you killed my father , your own brother .
how could you ?
how could l ?
i wanted something , he was in my way , i got rid of him .
he wasn' t fit to wear this crown , and you' re not fit to wear this crown .
this crown is mine .
this kingdom is ...
oops .
we won' t be needing that .
you saved my life .
then we' re even .
ella !
ella , stop kissing him !
you are never to kiss him again .
you wanna bet ?
marry me ?
now , that i' il do .
ah !
i now pronounce you husband and wife .
to a nation of equals .
to my good friends .
and to my true love , ella .
