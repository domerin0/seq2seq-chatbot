there on a windswept bluff , he stands waiting .
the man of your dreams .
the man who" ii love you more than anything the rest of your life .
you run to each other .
your bodies , your lips ... ... they" re coming closer and closer together .
until , finally ... ... you kiss .
okay , go .
janet , like this .
i feel weird , bev .
weird ?
wait till he shoves his tongue in your mouth .
ann , did you get the lights for the dining room ?
l" m looking for them , teresa .
now this is christmas , huh ?
yes , it" s beautif ul .
have lou look for them .
she wants it up before leo and bev get back .
i gotta go .
okay , leo .
beverly ann donof rio , your father" s waiting to go buy the tree !
l" m coming , mom !
okay , so is christmas .
this song" s giving me a headache .
wait .
before you go with pop .
why would a guy put his tongue in my mouth ?
what ? !
a boy does that because he wants you to bite it off .
go .
bye , mom .
hi .
you ready ?
yeah .
let" s go .
pop , everyone" s decorating the house .
good .
janet wanted to come .
when you" re in college , it" ii be her turn .
dreaming of w armth ?
dream w ith the everly brothers .
good , that" s our song !
great !
ready ?
pop , this is it !
pull over .
the big one , there .
see ?
l" ii buy that for you when l" m rich .
i bet you will .
mom and sis would like it .
you know what you want for christmas ?
you want the bike , right ?
it" s the bike .
but you think it" s too expensive .
see , i know how you think .
speak up .
if you don" t ask for anything , it" s what you get , nothing .
okay .
there" s this guy , billy schnar , he" s really cute .
billy schnar ?
we" re the smartest in class .
you know who he likes ?
guess !
who ?
melissa thomas , you know her ?
the one with braces and ugly red hair .
she thought israel was in europe .
you know why he likes her ?
guess !
because she" s stupid .
no , because she" s got boobs !
or it looks like she does , but she doesn" t .
she wears a bra ... ... which s q uishes her fat together ... ... and makes her look like she has big boobs .
pop , l" m gonna die if i don" t marry billy schnar .
l" m gonna die all because melissa has boobs ?
that" s just way too tragic , even for shakespeare .
okay , pop , so that" s why for christmas , l" d like a bra .
to enhance what i got , which is more than melissa .
you" re too young .
pop , you can" t negotiate my boobs .
too young or not , l" ve got them .
l" m a woman .
it" s hard to see through my clothes .
q uiet !
the answer is no .
keep your mind on books , not boys .
t his is w hy therapists are w ealthy . : moments like this .
w hy didn ' t he just get her the bra ? / t ' s certainly cheaper than a bicycle .
p arents and the damage they can do .
sometimes , it ' s endless .
but she survived .
" t hat w hich doesn ' t kill you , makes you w ant to die .
" / f she w as southern , she ' d have turned life into a song .
since she ' s from connecticut , she turned it into a memoir .
someone w ants to publish it , if she clears one hurdle .
so she called me for help .
t hat ' s w hy this is a tough day to tell her / ' m leaving her .
/ can al w ays tell w hen she ' s nervous .
she w ears a lot of makeup .
and today , she ' s packed on an e x tra layer of nervous .
forty minutes late .
l" m not complaining .
it" s just so unlike you .
sorry .
w e w ent off to solve the problem .
her problem .
mine w ould have to w ait .
what happened ?
you" re cold , lean into the vent .
sorry .
thanks for driving me to wallingford .

if ray doesn" t sign , they won" t publish it .
he will .
i know seeing ray is hard for you .
seeing ray doesn" t bother me .
it should .
and i understand .
i won" t make myself nuts .
l" ii stay calm and be positive .

what" s important is sky barrister will be there .
sky has had his hands in everything you got .
and has a ton of your poems .
and does he call you once ?
no .
bev , you are truly a great person .
but someone as conceited as sky won" t see that .
because all he can see is himself .
you know l" m right .
it" s true , bev .
let me wear that dress .
what ?
if i look half as beautif ul as you in that dress ... ... sky will have to notice me .
you can wear my dress .
no .
no , bev .
it won" t fit .
you got to let me wear that dress .
why ?
because i love you .
please , please , please .

who ?
did you ?
did you ?
i invited fay .
the noseguard points to me , like he" s gonna hurt me .
q uick , give me that !
they" re stuffing themselves .
guess it" s what bobby likes .
wonder what that feels like .
are they even ?
i think so .
you could be with any girl here .
of course , i know that .
l" m just a placekicker .
bobby , wait .
where are we going ?
come here .
what ?
mind if i sit ?
great .
who" s that sitting on kevin ?
some townie .

i checked out f. scott fitzgerald" s stories
l" m doing something daring right now , and l" m working up some optimism .
what are you doing ?
nothing .
l" m just a big chicken .
no , bev .
someone once said a coward and a hero have one thing in common : fear .
you may be scared , but you" re no coward .
i come off the field , following me are scouts ... ... f rom notre dame , penn state , ohio state , all talking to me .
so l" m like , " alphabetical order .

later when i can .

silver buttons of night" s velvet dress unbuttoned ... ... to reveal my simple universe and our heavenly touch .
the last one was about her legs trembling and heaving bosom .
she loves you .
bev !
i like the poem , bev !
bev !
don" t open that door !
okay .
is everything all right ?
can i have a cigarette ?
you" re blowing it out .
you" re blowing it out .
