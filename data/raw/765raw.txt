i know she loves you .
i' m gonna leave you guys alone .
but now you' re doing something for me .
remember that ass bag , hugo , from the convention ?
we used to be partners a long time ago .
one day , i had this killer idea to make films set ... ... in real life situations .
you know , real world porn .
i told the idea to hugo .
he says he' il think about it .
and what does that motherfucker do ?
takes my best girl , starts his own company with my idea ... ... and the guy makes millions .
it' s not the money that pisses me off .
i mean , fuck , it does piss me off ... ... but that' s not it .
it' s the perception .
everybody thinks hugo' s the genius .
it was my idea .
it' s like he' s simon , and i' m garfunkel .
look at me , man .
i' m fucking garfunkel .
look , seriously , i can' t do this .
don' t be a pussy .
nobody' s home .
why do you want this thing so bad ?
because it should' ve been mine .
i' il grab it and leave .
you don' t understand ... ... i have to be at a dinner in an hour .
my whole life depends on it .
you want me out of danielle' s life ?
yes , i do .
then let' s go .
but wait , seriously .
sometimes , if you wanna do something good ... ... you gotta do something bad .
yeah , but this is breaking and entering .
this is politics .
hey .
after this , we' re cool , okay ?
you' re all right , man .
yes .
i' d like to report a robbery .

thanks a lot , thanks a lot .
hey , there' s the big daddy .
matthew , what has been going on with you ?
some serious shit .
but , jesus , man , it' s good to see you .
will you excuse us , please ?
oh , my god .
am i blowing it ?
just try and control yourself .
just breathe , okay ?
all right .
i have learned a lot from my teachers .
but my best teacher has always been my mother ... ... a woman who worked three jobs trying to support me ... ... ever since i was a little nia .
and that is why i have always tried to answer the call ... ... of the great john f. kennedy ... ... who urged us to " ask not what your country " ...
let' s see here ...
i can' t speak a foreign language ... ... so that' s out .
and i ...
i certainly can' t quote j. f. k. now ... ... can i , ryan ?
you know what ?
it' s funny , i have this whole speech prepared ... ... and i' ve been practicing for weeks ... ... but you know what ?
i' m just gonna go with it .
moral fiber .
so , what is moral fiber ?
i mean ...
it' s funny , i used to think it was always telling the truth ... ... doing good deeds .
you know , basically being a fucking boy scout .
but lately , i' ve been seeing it differently .
now i think that moral fiber' s about ... ... finding that one thing you really care about .
that one special thing that means more ... ... to you than anything else in the world .
and when you find her ... ... you fight for her .
you risk it all .
you put her in front of everything ... ... all of it .
and maybe the stuff you do to help her isn' t so clean .
you know what ?
it doesn' t matter .
because in your heart you know ... ... that the juice is worth the squeeze .
that' s what moral fiber' s all about .
first , i' d just like to commend the candidates on ... ... their impressive remarks .
this year was a very tough decision .
and as much as we' d love to give you all scholarships , we can' t .
