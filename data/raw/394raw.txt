i thought weapons were forbidden on this planet .
besides ... ... i can' t believe you' d kill me for a field of empty holes .
it' s all i have .
your pain runs deep .
what do you know of my pain ?
let us explore it ... together .
each man hides a secret pain .
it must be exposed and reckoned with .
it must be dragged from the darkness into the light .
share your pain .
share your pain with me and gain strength from the sharing .
where did you get this power ?
the power was within you .
it is as if a weight has been lifted from my heart .
how can i repay you ?
join my quest .
what is it you seek ?
what you seek .
what all men have sought since time began .
the ultimate knowledge .
to find it we need a starship .
a starship ?
there are no starships on nimbus ill .
i have a way to bring one here .
but how ?
have faith , my friend .
there are more of us than you know .
you' re a vulcan .
' you' il have a great time on shore leave , bones .
' you' il be able to relax .
you call this relaxing ?
i' m a nervous wreck .
if i' m not careful , i' il end up talking to myself .
greetings , captain .
spock , what are you doing here ?
i' m monitoring your progress .
i' m flattered , but of all the points of interest here why pick me ?
the record for climbing el capitan is in no danger of being broken .
i' m doing this because i enjoy it .
not to mention the most important reason for climbing a mountain ...
because it' s there .
i do not think you realise the gravity of your situation .
on the contrary , gravity is foremost on my mind .
i' m trying to make an ascent .
go pester dr mccoy .
dr mccoy is not in the best of moods .
goddamn irresponsible ... !
playing games with life .
concentration is vital .
you must be one with the rock .
if you don' t stop distracting me ...
perhaps " because it is there " is not sufficient reason to climb a mountain .
i am hardly in a position to disagree .
hi , bones .
mind if we drop in for dinner ?
i am caithlin dar .
yes !
our new romulan representative .
welcome to paradise city , capital of the planet of galactic peace .
i' m st john talbot , the federation representative here on nimbus ill .
my charming companion is the klingon consul , korrd .
i expect that' s klingon for hello .
come in , my dear .
20 years ago , our three governments agreed to develop this planet .
a new age was born .
it died a quick death .
the settlers we conned into coming here took to fighting .
we forbad them weapons , but they fashioned their own .
it appears i' ve arrived just in time .
get away from that transmitter .
romulan .
terran .
klingon .
consider yourselves my prisoners .
prisoners ?
we' re already prisoners here on this worthless lump of rock .
what value could we be to you ?
nimbus ill is a worthless lump of rock .
but it is the only place in the galaxy that has the three of you .
our governments will stop at nothing to ensure our safety .
that' s exactly what i' m counting on .
uss enterprise , shakedown cruise report .
i think this new ship was put togetherbymonkeys .
halfthe doors won' t open , and guess whosejob itis to make itright ?
borgus frat !
let' s see what she' s got , scotty .
we found out , didn' t we ?
i know you' il whip her into shape .
uhura , i thought you were on leave .
i thought we were going together .
i can' t leave her when she needs me .
i had a feeling you would say something like that .
so i brought us dinner .
you' re the most understanding woman i know .
red alert .
i just fixed that damn thing !
turn it off , will you ?
red alert .
this is a red alert .
enterprise , acknowledge .
this is enterprise .
identify yourself .
this is starfleet .
we have a priority 7 situation in the neutralzone .
scotty , this is for real .
they can' t be serious !
the ship' s in pieces and we' ve got less than a skeleton crew .
starfleet , are you aware of our current status ?
yes .
stand by to copy operational orders and recall key personnel .
admit it , we' re lost .
yes , but we' re making good time .
commander sulu , come in .
i don' t believe this .
shore leave is cancelled .
rescued at last .
return to pre arranged co ordinates .
you can' t say we' re lost .
is there a problem ?
yes .
we' ve been caught in ... a blizzard .
we can' t see a thing .
direct us to the co ordinates .
my visual says sunny skies and 70 degrees .
look , the sun has come out .
it' s a miracle .
don' t worry , your secretis safe with me .
i' il send the shuttle foryou .
uhura , i owe you one .
come and get it !
bones , knock it off .
we' re right here and we' re starving .
bipodal seeds , doctor ?
beans , spock , but no ordinary beans .
these are from an old recipe handed down to me by my father .
if you stick your vulcan nose up at these , you' re insulting generations of mccoys .
in that case i have little choice but to sample your beans .
surprisingly good .
it does have a flavouring i' m not familiar with .
that' s the secret ingredient .
any more secret ingredient , bones ?
be my guest .
your secret ingredient is alcohol ?
tennessee whiskey .
bourbon and beans , an explosive combination .
can spock handle it ?
with that vulcan metabolism , he could eat a bowl of termites .
doctor , i am half human .
it certainly doesn' t show .
thank you .
this guy never changes .
i insult him and he takes it as a compliment .
you two could drive a man to drink .
what did i do ?
human life is far too precious to risk on crazy stunts .
you should have been killed when you fell off that mountain .
it did cross my mind .
but even as i fell i knew i wouldn' t die .
isn' t he the only one who' s immortal ?
no , it isn' t that .
i knew i wouldn' t die because the two of you were with me .
i do not understand .
i' ve always known ... ... l' il die alone .
i' il call valhalla and reserve a room for you .
all that time in space , getting on each other' s nerves ...
so what do we do on shore leave ?
we spend it together .
other people have families .
other people , not us .
what are you doing ?
i' m preparing to toast a " marsh melon " .
i' il be damned !
a marsh melon .
where did you learn to do that ?
i have familiarised myself with the customs associated with camping out .
what do we do after we toast the marsh melon ?
we consume them .
no , i mean after that .
we are required to engage in a ritual known as the sing along .
i haven' t sung around the campfire since i was a boy in lowa .
what are we going to sing ?
" camptown races .
" pack up your troubles .
are we leaving ?
it' s a song title .
" moon over rigel 7 .
" row , row , row your boat .
do you know " row your boat " ?
it didn' t come up in my research .
the lyrics are very simple ...
row , row , row your boat gently down the stream .
merrily , merrily , merrily , merrily , life is but a dream .
the doctor and i will start off and you jump in .
doctor , if you please .
don' t say i didn' t warn you .
spock , why didn' t you jump in ?
i cannot comprehend the words .
it' s a song , you green blooded vulcan .
the words aren' t important .
you just have a good time singing .
i am sorry , doctor .
were we having a good time ?
i liked him better before he died .
let' s just get some sleep .
captain ...
we' re on leave .
call me jim .
jim ...
yes , spock ?
life is not a dream .
go to sleep , spock .
yes , captain .
good night , bones .
good night , jim .
good night , spock .
good night , doctor .
good night , spock .
good night , jim .
i don' t know .
i just don' t know .
captain klaa , we have the target in sight .
a probe ofancient origin .
difflcult to hit ?
most difflcult .
good .
all weapons atmy control .
scope .
shooting space garbage is no test ofa warrior' s mettle .
i need a target thatfilghts back .
captain , new data , hostages on nimbus ill .
one ofthe hostages is a klingon .
and the others ?
a terran and a romulan .
the federation will be sending a rescue ship ofits own .
plot course fornimbus ill .
i' ve always wanted to engage a federation ship .
get the damn light out of my face .
we had to send the shuttlecraft .
the transporter is non operational .
we have received new orders .
i had my communicator .
you forgot to take it with you .
i wonder why i did that .
it appears shore leave has been cancelled .
pack out your trash .
all i ask is a tall ship and a star to steer her by .
melville .
john masefield .
are you sure about that ?
i' m well versed in the classics .
then how come you don' t know " row , row , row your boat " ?
enterprise , you have control .
we' re doing just fine .
all i can say is they don' t make them like they used to .
you told me you could have this ship operational in two weeks .
i think you gave me too much time .
how many times do i have to tell you ?
the right tool for the right job .
i' ve never seen him happier .
bridge ...
i hope .
i could use a shower .
yes .
doesn' t anything work on this ship ?
they can' t send us out like this .
starfleet transmission on line .
put it on the view screen .
can we have a little quiet , please ?
can you clear that up ?
can we have a little quiet ?
bob !
jim !
we are dressing informally .
i' m on my way to the shower .
i apologise for cancelling shore leave .
we have a dangerous situation out on nimbus ill .
on the planet of galactic peace ?
a terroristforce has captured the only settlement .
they' ve taken hostages .
the klingon , the romulan , the federation consuls .
the enterprise is not up to specs ...
the enterprise is a disaster .
we have ships in the quadrant .
butno experienced commanders .
i need jim kirk .
please !
proceed to nimbus ill and assess the situation .
avoid a confrontation .
above all , however , get those hostages back safely .
have the klingons responded ?
no , butyou can bet they will .
plot a course for nimbus ill , mr sulu .
course plotted .
i' m afraid the ship' s problems will have to be solved en route .
i' m counting on each one of you to give his best .
let' s go to work .
jim , if you ask me , and you haven' t ...
i think this is a terrible idea .
we' re bound to bump into the klingons .
and they don' t exactly like you .
the feeling' s mutual .
engine room , we' il need all the power you can muster , mister .
we' il beat those klingon devils even if i have to get out and push .
i hope it won' t come to that .
all possible speed , mr sulu .
aye , sir .
what' s the matter ?
i miss my old chair .
the starship enterprise has been dispatched to nimbus ill .
enterprise ?
that' s kirk' s ship !
ifl could defeatkirk ...
you would be the greatest warrior in the galaxy .
maximum speed !
success !
stardate 84 ...
good morning , captain .
forget it .
we have the hostage information .
put it on the screen .
this is an authorised transmission from the starfleetmemorybank .
not general korrd !
he' s apparently fallen from favour .
korrd' s military strategies were required learning at the academy .
when they put me out to pasture , i hope i fair better than korrd .
this must be the hostage tape .
a short time ago , we surrendered to the galactic army oflight .
we are now in the protective custody oftheir leader .
we will be treated humanely as long as we cooperate .
he requests thatyou send a starship to parley for our release at once .
we are in good health and would appreciate your immediate response .
i regret this desperate act , but these are desperate times .
i mean no harm to these innocents , but do notputme to the test .
i implore you to respond immediately .
what is it ?
you look like you' ve seen a ghost .
perhaps i have , captain .
spock , what is it ?
do you know this vulcan ?
i cannot be certain .
but he does seem familiar ?
he reminds me of someone i knew in my youth .
i didn' t know you had one .
i do not often think of the past .
who does he remind you of ?
a gifted young student .
he possessed a great intelligence .
it was assumed that he would join the great scholars of vulcan .
but he was a revolutionary .
what do you mean ?
the knowledge he sought was forbidden by vulcan belief .
forbidden ?
he rejected his logical upbringing .
he embraced the animal passions of our ancestors .
he believed the key to self knowledge was emotion ... not logic .
imagine that , a passionate vulcan .
when he encouraged others to follow him , he was banished from vulcan .
fascinating .
captain to the bridge .
on my way .
spock ?
coming , captain .
approaching nimbus ill .
standard orbit , mr sulu .
paradise city is demanding to know our intentions .
respond with static .
let them think we' re having difficulty .
paradise city , we are barely receiving your transmission .
transporter room , status .
transporter is still inoperative .
if we could lock on to the hostages , we couldn' t beam them up .
we' il have to get them out ourselves .
klingon vessel approaching .
bird of prey .
1 . 9 hours till her weapons are in range .
damn !
let' s go .
their scanning equipment is primitive , but effective .
land at co ordinate 856 . 3 .
that' s far from the city .
we cannot risk detection .
mr sulu , execute .
this is the starship enterprise .
a federation starship .
this is captain pavel chekov .
you are in violation ofour treaty .
release your hostages at once orsuffer the consequences .
your threats amuse me .
what consequences ?
a klingon warship will arrive within the hour .
the klingons will be quite angry .
they are likely to destroy the planet .
then it is fortunate i have you and your starship to protect me .
you and your first officer are to beam down to my co ordinates .
we will be happy to beam down , but we musthave certain assurances .
at foot speed , the journey to the city will take 1 . 2 hours .
we don' t have 1 . 2 hours .
wait a minute ...
perfect !
we' il have to get their attention .
what' s that ?
is she naked ?
hello , boys .
i' ve always wanted to play to a captive audience .
spock , be one with the horse .
yes , captain .
open the gate .
it' s our lookout party .
federation soldiers are right behind us .
close the gate .
where are they going ?
spock ...
hold your horse , i' m scanning .
the hostages are being held in that structure .
galileo , start your run .
phasers on stun .
sulu , take out that light .
what' s going on ?
surrender , you are under attack .
it wasn' t bloodshed i wanted .
wait !
come back .
uhura , come on down .
roger , coming in .
nimbus ill is famous forits wildilfe , and the flshing is terrifilc !
easy flnancing through federation federal can take you there .
thank god .
please cooperate .
hand over your weapons .
well done , my friends .
qualse tu ?
spock !
spock , it' s me .
it' s sybok .
you' ve finally caught up with me .
don' t you have anything to say to me ?
you are under arrest for 17 violations of the neutral zone treaty .
you' ve developed a sense of humour .
i did not intend to amuse you .
these are serious charges .
however , if you surrender now ...
i' m sorry , spock , i' m not through violating the neutral zone treaty .
in fact , i' m just getting started .
for my next violation ,
i intend to steal something .
something very big .
your starship .
you staged all this to get your hands on my ship ?
who are you ?
captain james t kirk .
i thought captain chekov ...
i see ...
very clever , captain .
spock , you have been given a second chance to join me .
i am a starfleet officer .
of course .
of course .
then i' il take the ship without your help .
shuttle en route .
position of bird of prey ?
closing !
estimating attack range in 8, 000 kellicams .
stealth approach , slow to one quarterimpulse power .
prepare to cloak .
engage cloaking device .
the bird of prey must have cloaked .
raise shields .
the shuttle ... ?
do it .
go to red alert .
once we control your vessel , we' il bring up our followers .
the klingons are out there .
we' il be lucky to make it to the ship .
this is enterprise , red alert .
bird ofprey approaching .
raising shields .
find a safe harbour .
no !
no reply .
remain on course .
listen to me .
in order for this craft to enter the landing bay ,
enterprise must lower the shields and activate the tractor beam .
to re raise the shields will take ...
15 . 5 seconds .
an eternity , during which we' il be vulnerable to attack .
he speaks the truth .
if my people are cloaked , then they intend to strike .
we cannot turn back .
let me do something .
very well , do what you must , but no more .
enterprise , this is kirk .
kirk !
he' s on the shuttlecratf !
alter the attack course !
understand your situation .
are unable to return to planet .
stand by to execute emergency landing plan ...
b
emergency landing plan b ?
b as in barricade .
what are you doing ?
in order to lower and raise the shields quickly , we' il forego the tractor beam .
we' il fly her in manually .
how often have you done this ?
actually , it' s my first attempt .
he' s good ... really .
scotty , open bay doors .
stand by to de cloak forflring .
scotty , lower shields .
lowering shields .
bird of prey bearing 105 . 2 .
go , sulu .
they' re in .
bear on enterprise .
enterprise targeted !
warp speed now !
firing !
track her course !
he' s good .
we must change course at once .
i' il take you to the bridge .
pick it up .
sybok ...
you must surrender .
no !
you must kill me .
shoot him !
for a moment ...
i thought you might actually do it .
put him in the brig with captain kirk .
spock , you will accompany me to the bridge ?
no ...
i will not .
you know i' m right .
then you must join them .
these two will be useful .
give us a moment alone .
don' t be afraid .
goddamn it , spock .
you betrayed us all .
i do not expect you to forgive me .
i ought to knock you on your ass .
if you think it would help .
you want me to hold him ?
stay out of this ...
why ?
all you had to do was pull the trigger .
then sybok would be dead .
i ordered you to defend your ship .
and kill my brother .
a fellow vulcan is not a ...
sybok also is a son of sarek .
he' s your brother brother ?
you made that up .
i did not .
you don' t have a brother .
technically i don' t have a brother .
see ?
i have a half brother .
i' ve got to sit down .
you and sybok have the same father but different mothers ?
sybok' s mother was a vulcan princess , but we were raised as brothers .
why didn' t you tell us this before ?
it is a personal matter .
for that i am sorry .
that makes everything all right .
sorry !
spock could no more kill his own brother than he could kill you .
he' s already in the brig .
besides , we' ve got bigger problems to deal with .
like how do we get out of here .
i' il say one thing , you never cease to amaze me .
nor i myself .
i was beginning to worry .
it' s all right .
sybok will explain .
what are you doing ?
plotting our new course .
you have no authority .
what' s going on here ?
pavel , listen to this man .
i don' t understand .
each of us hides a secret pain .
share yours with me and gain strength from the sharing .
useless .
unwise .
you could have warned me .
there' s got to be a way out .
this new brig is escape proof .
how do you know ?
the designers tested it using the most intelligent person they could find .
he failed to escape .
did this person have pointed ears ?
and an unerring capacity for getting his shipmates into trouble ?
he did have pointed ears .
following new course .
warp 7 .
arrival in 6 . 7 hours at present speed .
now that we' re underway , i' il announce my intentions to the rest of the ship .
brave crew ofthe starship enterprise , consider the questions ofexistence .
questions that man has asked since he first gazed at the stars and dreamed .
my vulcan ancestors were ruled by their emotions .
they felt with their hearts .
they made love with their hearts .
they believed with their hearts .
and they believed in a place where these questions would be answered .
modern dogma tells us this place is a myth .
a fantasy concocted by pagans .
itis no fantasy .
i tell you ... it exists .
my brothers , we have been chosen to undertake the greatest adventure of all time .
the discovery of sha ka ree .
is it possible he' s found sha ka ree , the reason he left vulcan ?
our destination is the planet sha ka ree .
it lies beyond the great barrier ... ... at the centre ofthe galaxy .
the centre of the galaxy ?
where it is fabled to exist .
the centre of the galaxy can' t be reached by any ship .
sybok possessed the keenest intellect i' ve ever known .
when i get the ship back , and sybok is in here , you can debate sha ka ree until you' re green in the face .
you' re either with me or you' re not .
i am here , captain .
that' s a little vague , spock .
what' s that noise ?
it' s a primitive form of communication known as morse code .
you' re right .
i' m out of practice .
that' s an s.
t ...
a ...
n ...
d ...
end of word .
stand .
new word .
b ...
a ...
c ...
k ...
back .
stand back !
what are you standing around for ?
this is a jailbreak .
these three are strong .
this will be quite a challenge .
we' ve got to find them .
we can' t trust anyone .
send a distress signal .
there is an emergency send apparatus in the observation room .
you might be able to reach it by means of turbo shaft 3 .
it' s a long and dangerous climb .
some of us get off on that .
get the transporter working and contact a rescue ship .
which way to the turbo shaft ?
down that tunnel and turn right .
you can' t miss it .
mr scott , you' re amazing .
i know this ship like the back of my hand .
we' il get a good workout .
yeah , or a heart attack .
get mr scott to sick bay .
this is going to take me forever .
where' s spock ?
i believe i' ve found a faster way .
bones ?
i' il wait for the next car .
we' re not splitting up .
we' re too heavy .
it must be the marsh melons .
spock , the booster rockets .
i can' t control their power .
fire the rockets .
captain , please come back down .
hit the brakes .
i overshot the mark by one level .
nobody' s perfect .
spock .
emergency channel open .
to anyone within range , this is captain james t kirk .
if you read me , acknowledge .
acknowledge .
this is starfleet command , we readyou .
over .
a hostile force has taken control of our vessel .
our co ordinates are 000 . 2 .
request emergency assistance .
understood , enterprise .
we are dispatching a rescue ship immediately .
plot course 000 . 2 .
but captain , that course will take us into the barrier as well .
where kirk goes , we follow .
i trust your message was received .
you can' t expect us to stand by .
what you fear is the unknown .
the people of your planet once believed their world was flat .
columbus proved it was round .
they said the sound barrier could never be broken .
it was broken .
they said warp speed could not be achieved .
the great barrier is the ultimate expression of this universal fear .
it is an extension of personal fear .
captain kirk , i so much want your understanding .
i want your respect .
are you afraid to hear me out ?
i' m afraid of nothing .
wait outside .
i' m sure you have many questions .
here , amidst the stars of our own galaxy , we shall seek the answers together .
easy , scotty .
you' re back with us .
i dreamt that a madman had taken over the enterprise .
he' s not a madman .
he' s not ?
sybok has put us in touch with feelings we' ve always been afraid to express .
i have to get to the transporter .
scotty !
there' s so much i want to tell you .
wait till i' m a wee bit stronger .
i don' t think i could take it in my present condition ... or yours .
sha ka ree .
the source .
heaven .
eden .
call it what you will .
the klingons call it qui tu .
the romulans , vorta vor .
in andorian it is unpronounceable .
still , every culture shares this common dream .
a place from which creation sprang .
for us it will soon be reality .
my only reality is that i' m a prisoner on my own ship .
what is this power you have to control the minds of my crew ?
i don' t control minds ...
i free them .
how ?
by making you face your pain and draw strength from it .
once that' s done , fear cannot stop you .
it sounds like brainwashing to me .
your pain is the deepest of all .
i can feel it , can' t you ?
leonard .
this is some kind of trick .
leonard .
father ?
my god !
don' t do this to me .
leonard .
i' m here .
i' m with you , dad .
the pain .
stop the pain .
i' ve done everything i can do .
you' ve got to hang on .
i can' t stand the pain .
help me .
all my knowledge and i can' t save him .
you' ve done all you can .
the support system will keep him alive .
you call this alive ?
son ...
release me .
i can' t do that , dad .
but how can i watch him suffer like this ?
you' re a doctor .
i' m his son .
why did you do it ?
to preserve his dignity .
that wasn' t the worst of it , was it ?
no !
share it .
not long after , they found a cure .
a goddamn cure .
if you didn' t kill him , he' d have lived .
i released him !
you did what you thought was right .
yes !
no !
release this pain !
this pain has poisoned your soul for a long time .
now you' ve taken the first step .
the other steps we' il take together .
each man' s pain is unique .
i hide no pain .
i know you better than that .
do you ?
spock , don' t .
it' s all right , captain .
proceed .
what is this ?
i believe we are witnessing my birth .
sarek , your son .
so human .
spock ?
what have you done to my friends ?
nothing .
this is who they are .
didn' t you know that ?
no , i didn' t .
now learn something about yourself .
no , i refuse .
jim , try to be open about this .
about what ?
how i made wrong choices in my life ?
turning left instead of right ?
i don' t need sybok to take me on a tour of my weaknesses .
to be brainwashed by a conman !
this conman took away my pain .
with the wave of a magic wand ?
the things we carry with us make us who we are .
if we lose them , we lose ourselves .
i don' t want my pain taken away .
i need my pain .
captain , you remain here .
spock , dr mccoy , come with me .
spock ?
i cannot go with you .
why not ?
i belong here .
i don' t understand .
sybok ...
you are my brother , but you do not know me .
i am not the outcast boy you left behind many years ago .
i found myself and my place , and i know who i am .
i cannot go with you .
you' d better count me out , too .
then i' il see you on the other side .
wait !
we' il never make it through the great barrier .
if we do , will that convince you that my vision was true ?
it was given to me by god .
he waits for us on the other side .
you are mad .
am i ?
we' il see .
they say no ship can survive this .
they' re wrong .
danger is an illusion .
we have no instrument readings .
mr sulu , full ahead .
full ahead , aye .
is it possible ?
fascinating .
are we dreaming ?
if we are , then life is a dream .
instruments are back on line .
incredible .
there is a power source emanating from the planet like nothing i' ve seen .
sha ka ree .
qui tu .
vorta vor .
eden .
about the ship ...
the ship needs its captain .
no special conditions ?
no conditions .

with a starship .
this starship ...
could it carry my wisdom beyond the barrier ?
it could , yes .
then i shall make use of it .
it will be your chariot .
excuse me ...
i will reach every corner of creation .
i' d like to ask a question .
what does god need with a starship ?

what does god need with a starship ?
what are you doing ?
asking a question .
who is this creature ?

the ship .

enterprise , listen carefully .
this is my doing .
this is my arrogance .
my vanity .
