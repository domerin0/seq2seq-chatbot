who owned these ?
malibu equity and investments .
roger van zant .
owns banks in the caymans ... ... runs investment portfolios for offshore drug money .
stuff like that .
so ?
you ripped off his bearer bonds .
he' s insured .
that' s the point .
he collects 100 percent from the insurance .
he' s a player .
maybe he buys his bonds back from us ... ... for 60 percent of their value .
makes 40 percent on top of the 100 percent .
sell it back to him , that' s an extra $320, 000 to you .
try it on .

somebody called a guard " slick .
now , i figure this guy ... ... went for that hold out piece , ankle holster .
from here ... ... bang , bang ... ... bang , bang , bang .
this side .
this guy has got what appears to be a double tap entry wound to the sternum .
tattooing around the head wound , scorched bone , close range .
probably executed .
it was $1 . 6 million in bearer bonds .
they ignored the loose cash .
' cause they had no time .
they were on a clock .
which means they knew our response time to a 2 11 ... ... had our air , immobilized it , entered ... ... escaped in under three minutes .
it' s a good spot here .
we got good escape routes .
two freeways ... ... within a quarter of a mile .
traffic video camera ?

popped guard no .
3 because ... what difference does it make ?
why leave a living witness ?
drop of a hat , these guys will rock and roll .
the shape charge .
the shape charge indicates that they are technically proficient .
proficient enough to go in on the prowl .

you never told me i' d be excluded .
i told you when we hooked up ... ... that you' d have to share me ... ... with all the bad people and all the ugly events on this planet .
and i bought into that sharing ... ... because i love you .
i love you fat , bald , money , no money , driving a bus .
i don' t care .
but you have got to be present like a normal guy .
that' s sharing .
this is not sharing , this is leftovers .
hi , honey , guess what ?
i walked into this house today ...
... where this junkie asshole just fried his baby in a microwave ...
... because he was crying too loud , so let me share that with you .
come on , let' s share that and in sharing it ...
... we' il somehow cathartically dispel all that heinous shit .
right ?
wrong .
you know why ?
' cause you prefer the normal routine .
we fuck and you don' t speak .
' cause i got to hold on to my angst .
i preserve it ... ... because i need it .
it keeps me sharp , on the edge .
where i gotta be .
you don' t live with me .
you live among the remains of dead people .
you sift through the detritus .
you read the terrain .
you search for signs of passing ... ... for the scent of your prey ... ... and then you hunt them down .
that' s the only thing you' re committed to .
the rest is the mess you leave as you pass through .
what i don' t understand is why i can' t cut loose of you .
let' s go , baby .
i met the manager .
is that the boss ?
i did time for what that motherfucker does every day .
can you just handle it till we find you something new ?
can you do that ?
ain' t a hard time been invented that i cannot handle .
why' re you hanging with me ?
because i' m proud of you .
you' re proud of me ?
why the hell are you proud of me ?
come on home .

i was skiing .
i was trying to ski .
that' s what people do there .
you go skiing ... ... and you meet people .
you try to have a good time .
did you have a good time ?
no .
why not ?
i' m not good at meeting people .
you met me .
that happened without my thinking about it .
which is why i probably ....
no , it' s because you are fine .
take off with me for a while .
where ?
new zealand .
when ?
i have to go separate .
you can meet me there .
but my job ....
i got money .
you don' t need money .
you could set up a studio and work there .
i don' t know .
what' s there to know ?
are you married ?
what ?
the last thing i am is married .
i' m a needle starting at zero going the other way .
then , all of a sudden ... ... someone like you comes along .
you don' t know me .
i know enough .
come with me .
what' s wrong ?
nothing' s wrong .
everything' s right .

they didn' t steal anything yet .
it gets knocked back to a misdemeanor , they do six months and they' re out .
no fucking way .
i' m not taking the heat from my boss .
they are not walking .

he is a fucking luxury .
our problem is to take the bank , or split right now .
do not go home , do not pack , nothing .

you do this sharp , that sharp .
look how sharp this guy is to figure that .
funny as a heart attack .
three marriages ?
do you think that means he likes staying home ?
means he' s one of those guys out there ... ... prowling around all night , dedicated .
with him and this much heat , you should pass .
it' s worth the stretch .
this guy can hit or miss .
you can' t miss once .
you sure ?

so you never wanted a regular type life ?
w ' the fuck is that ?
barbecues and ball games ?
yeah .
this regular type life , that your life ?
my life ?
no , my life ....
my life' s a disaster zone .
i got a stepdaughter so fucked up ... ... because her real father is this large type asshole .
i got a wife .
we' re passing each other on the down slope of a marriage .
my third .
because i spend all my time chasing guys like you around the block .
that' s my life .
don' t let yourself get attached to anything you are not willing to walk out on in 30 seconds ...
... flat if you feel the heat around the corner .
if you' re on me and you got to move when i move ... ... how do you expect to keep a marriage ?
that' s an interesting point .
what are you , a monk ?
i have a woman .
what do you tell her ?
i tell her i' m a salesman .
so , if you spot me coming around that corner ... ... you' re just gonna walk out on this woman ?
not say good bye ?
that' s the discipline .
that' s pretty vacant .
it is what it is .
it' s that , or we both better go do something else .
i don' t know how to do anything else .
neither do i.
i don' t much want to , either .
neither do i.
you know , i have this recurring dream .
i' m sitting at this big banquet table and ... ... all the victims of all the murders i ever worked are there ... ... and they' re staring at me with these black eyeballs ... ... because they got eight ball hemorrhages from the head wounds .
and there they are , these big balloon people ... ... because i found them two weeks after they' d been under the bed .
the neighbors reported the smell ... ... and there they are ... ... all just sitting there .
what do they say ?
nothing .
no talk ?
they have nothing to say .
we just look at each other .
they look at me ... ... and that' s it .
that' s the dream .
i have one where i' m drowning .
i gotta wake myself up and start breathing or i' il die in my sleep .
know what that' s about ?
having enough time .
enough time ... ... to do what you want to do ?
that' s right .
you doing it now ?
no , not yet .
you know , we' re sitting here ... ... like a couple of regular fellas .
you do what you do , and i do what i gotta do .
now that we' ve been face to face ... ... if i' m there and i gotta put you away ... ... i won' t like it .
but , i tell you ... ... if it' s between you ... ... and some poor bastard whose wife you' re gonna turn into a widow ... ... brother ... ... you are going down .
there' s a flip side to that coin .
what if you do got me boxed in ... ... and i gotta put you down ?
because no matter what ... ... you will not get in my way .
we' ve been face to face , yeah .
but i will not hesitate .
not for a second .
maybe that' s the way it' il be .
or ... ... who knows ?
maybe we' il never see each other again .
they dumped us .
what ?
they dumped us .
what do you mean ?
chris slipped away .
he doesn' t talk about their scores ... ... so there' s nothing for me to get from marciano .
i just tried .
what about cheritto ?
same .
transponders got put on a bus to san clemente .
they dumped all our surveillance ?
yes , at the same time .
9 : 00 p . m .

then mccauley drives in to lax where surveillance can' t fly over .
his car' s still there .

you want to put dominick in the bedroom ?
he stays with me .
so , what now ?
he' s right .
you want out ?
this is out .
you believe you have to betray chris ?
no shit .
that' s right .
you would have to .
see , if you don' t betray chris , you victimize dominick .
' cause he' il be an orphan when you go to prison as an accessory ... ... ' cause you got no parents to take him .
so he ends up raised in foster homes ... ... juvenile facilities .
then he steals a car .
then he winds up in gladiator academies like chino and tracy .
fucked for life .
you know what happens , because you' ve been there .
dominick didn' t get a chance yet to choose his life .
but chris did .
if you give up chris , you get off clean .
you can do it ... ... for your kid , so you can raise him .
what else are you selling ?
all kinds of shit .
but i don' t have to sell this , you know it .
this kind of shit here sells itself .
here' s an update .
drucker' s on line 2 .
hold on for a second .
drucker' s on the other line .
conference him in .
go ahead .
vincent , it' s me .

what' s it going to be ?
we' re set here .
she' il make the call .

hugh benny has reformed his wayward life ... ... and become a born again good citizen .
apparently , neil got sold out to us by this cowboy named waingro .
van zant .
units are at van zant' s house as we speak ... ... because he got shot dead earlier tonight .
if neil goes after anybody else , it' s going to be waingro .
waingro just got himself a suite at the airport marquis ... ... under the name jamieson .
he' s there now .
i want you to get that to bail bondsmen , bookies ... ... assignment officers and snitches in county .
anyone you can think of who' il put it on the street .
deploy a team at the hotel ... ... and personally check their coms every 30 minutes .
because maybe neil will go for him .
how' re you feeling ?
banged up , but i' il live .
he' s here .
neil is still here .
i can feel it .

you can lounge around here on her sofa .
in her ex husband' s ... ... dead tech , post modernistic , bullshit house ... ... if you want to .
but you do not get to watch ... ... my fucking ... ... television set !
for god' s sake .
put the television set down .
