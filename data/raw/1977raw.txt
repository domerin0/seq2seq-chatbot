<i>did you ever wonder what your pupose in life was ? </ i>
<i>this book is about finding you purpose or destiny . </ i>
<i>every soul has its path . </ i>
<i>but sometimes , that path is not clear . </ i>
<i>in inner map theory is an example</ i> <i>how each soul begins with an imprint , all compacted, </ i> <i>into a pattern , thast has been selected by your soul</ i> <i>before you even got here . </ i>
<i>you know , i guess the reason why i like japan . </ i>
<i>it is the best out of all eastern countries, </ i> <i>is because i really feel close buddhism . </ i>
i really believe in reincarnation .
that is part of jumi too , and of " mignight velocity " because although keanu dies he eventually gets reincarnated .
so , there is hope in reincarnation , i think .
what was it like working with keanu reeves ?
he was always giving me ideas really helpful .
he made me feel really comfortable .
we both have two dogs , and we both live in los angeles .
so we have all these things in common .
and we both really like mexican food , and yoga , and karate .
he got married a couple of times .
to some nice women .
and beautiful women too .
you and i would be crazy for these woman , but ... there were always rumors .
i never liked this actress , so i never gave a damn whether he was straight or not .
hey !
thank you .
what can i get you ?
i' m not sure .
for relaxing times ...
make it suntori times .
i' il have a vodka tonic .
so what , are you doing here ?
a couple of things .
taking a break from my wife , forgetting my son' s birthday .
and getting paid two million dollars to endorse a whisky , when i could be doing a play somewhere .
but the good news is : the whisky works .
what do you do ?
my husband is a photographer , so he is here working .
i wasn' t doing anything , so i came here .
and to be with some friends who live here .
how long have you been married ?
two years .
25 years for me .
your probably just having a mid life .
did you buy a porsche yet ?
i was thinking about it .
25 years , it' s ... impressive .
well you figure , you sleep one third of our life .
that knocks of 8 years of marriage , right there .
so you' re down to 16 years in change .
you are just only a teenager at marriage : you know how to drive , but there is still the ocassional accident .
what do you do ?
i am not sure yet .
i just graduated last spring .
what did you study ?
philosophy .
there is a good buck , in that record .
so far , its proven ok .
i am sure that you will figure out the angles .
i hope your porsche works out .
cheers to that .
wish i could sleep .
me too .
how was that ?
it was good , i am tired .
i gotta go downstairs to meet kelly , for drinks to talk about some photo thing .
maybe i' il go downstairs with you .
you want to come ?
yes .
ok .
everybody always telling me
kelly , you are an anorexic .
and i' m like ; no i am not .
i eat so much junkfood , you would not believe me .
i have a very good metabolism .
it is strange , because i thought that you were anorexic .
everybody thinks it !
because you seem if ... you know .
thank you , i know .
i eat whatever , i have a good metabolism .
my dad was an anorexic .
really ?
yes , he fought on the american side of " the bay of the pigs .
and he was taken prisoner .
and the whole time that he was there , they tortured him about food .
every day , they told him that they had put poison in his food .
so they would always make themselves throw up after every meal .
that' s horrible .
crazy shit .
do you know a little the station wagon beatific ?
i' ve been like taking it to next level shit
like i' il take that and put a delay on it .
so its like evolving the beat , so it sound hell large on the track .
you know what i' m saying ?
no .
you don' t listen to a hip hop ?
oh my god , listen to me !
i tried this power cleanse .
it so amazing .
promise me than you will try this power cleanse ?
i did it last week .
it is amazing .
it is so good to get the toxins out of your body .
hello !
you ever switch seats ?
i like this one .
if i fall , someone will notice me .
you having a nice time ?
can you keep the secret ?
i' m trying to organize a prison break .

that was a stupid idea .
just feeling tight , shoulders and neck .
so i called down , and had a a shiatsu massage .
that' s nice .
the tightness has completely disappeared , and replaced by ... unbelievable pain .
stagering , unbearable pain .
that' s too bad .
i' m in pain .
i got my foot banged up .
want to see it ?
how do you say no ?
oh , my god !
when did you do this ?
the other day .
it hurts , you know .
didn' t you feel any pain ?
yeah , it really hurted .
that toe is almost dead .
i think i have to take you to the doctor , you cannot put that back into the shoe .
no , you don' t think so .
well , you either go to a doctor , or leave your foot here .
he' s smiling .
you like that idea ?
they love black toe in this country .
do you have a sharp knife ?
in this country , someone has to prefer black toe .
black toe !
we should probably hang around until someone orders it ?
hey !
what' s with the straight face ?
hospital regulations get in there .
all right .
thank you .
no , don' t .
hey !
use the horn !
let' s try " mixed intestines " .
go .
switched the beer , hey ?
someone switched the sake .
hello .
we need a doctor or emergency room .
it is not an emergency , it is just my foot .
we go over there ... which number ?
we' re not going to another hospital , so whatever you say is okay .
could you put that back in the garage for us ?
is it for me ?
yeah it can be for you .
<i>hey bob , it is charlotte, </ i>
<i>i am going to meet charlie in this club called , " the orange " . < / i></ i>
<i>i' il fax you the plan , so you can get there .

he dances !
but where he goes ?
there you are !
say hello .
are you ready ?
come !
thank you tokyo !
the first time that i saw you , you were in your tuxedo in the bar .
you were very dashing .
i like the " mad squirrel " .
the first time that i saw you , was in the elevator .
really ?
don' t you remember ?
i guess you do kind of blend in .
did i pull you the language ?
no , you smiled .
i did ?
yes .
it was only an accidental smile , i haven' t see it since .
just that one time .
like that , but bigger .
bigger .
not that big .
<i>my goodness ! < / i></ i>
why did they switcht the " r' s and the " l' s here ?
to laugh , to mix it up .
they have to amuse themselves .
because we are not making them laugh .
let' s never come here again because it would never be as much fun .
whatever you say , you are the boss !
i am stuck .
does it get easier ?
yes .
it gets easier .
oh yeah , look at you !
thank you .
the more you know who you are , and what you want , the less things upset you .
i just don' t know what i am supposed to be .
i tried beeing a writer but i hate what i write .
i tried taking pictures .
but i am mediocre .
every girl goes through a photography phase .
you know like horses ... to take some stupid photos of your feet .
you will figure that out , i am not worried for you .
continue to write .
but i am so mean .
it is what it is necessary .
and your marriage ?
has it improved ?
it is hard .
one had fun well , before .
lydia came with me on the filmings and one laughed of all that .
she takes care a lot of the children , but she doesn' t have need ... that i am ... present .
i miss to the children , but they are well .
all complicates itself , with children .
it is frightening .
the day of the birth of the first is the most terrifying of your life .
no one tells you those things .
life that you lived until there is finished .
and comes back never .
but they learn to walk , and they learn to speak , and you want to be by them .
and you discover that these are the most marvelous people of your life .
it is cute .
where did you grow ?
i grew to new york .
then i moved to los angeles with john , once gotten married , but it is so over there different .
i know .
john finds that i am snob .
your case is not desperate .
