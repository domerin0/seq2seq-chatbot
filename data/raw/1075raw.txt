your t shirts were in my closet .
these are yours .
he should let us sort our own clothes .
he seems preoccupied lately .
exactly .
would i wear old fashioned underwear like these ?
did my underwear offend you ?
you know what i mean .
i' m afraid i don' t .
dad , are you all right ?
i' m fine .
why did you ask ?
no , it' s just that ....
do i look bad ?
no ....
i' m fine !
grandpa chu !
shan shan , jin rong , come in !
i should have come sooner to visit and thank you in person .
jin rong is too busy to bring me over .
i almost had to force her to take me .
she said that you and your whole family really took care of them .
it' s only my duty .
jia jen and jin feng were good classmates .
you took care of my daughter when she was in tainan .
now that jin rong is alone in taipei ....
shan shan !
little aunt , can we draw ?
for uncle chu .
thanks , but
jia jen , it' s been so long .
mrs. liang !
still teaching at the same school ?
yes .
still not married ?
yes .
frankly , marriage is quite meaningless .
a bad marriage is such a burden .
you might as well get a divorce .
you have to be insane to marry such a loser , like jin rong' s husband .
it' s like a tired dog dragging some broken cart .
and in the end , you' re left all alone .
lsn' t that so , mr. chu ?
yes .
ma , why do you have to say that ?
but it' s true !
prepare some fruit , jia jen .
okay .
your second daughter ?
the youngest .
hello , mrs. liang .
how old are you ?
twenty .
it' s time to have a boyfriend .
don' t wait too long like your older sister .
let' s sit down .
let me make some tea .
can we draw now ?
all right .
mrs. liang .
you are ?
jia chien .
that' s right .
you' re no .
2 .
aren' t you pretty ?
thank you .
are you used to taipei yet ?
it' s okay .
good to be home .
do you have a boyfriend ?
i' m sure you have several .
keep your options open .
don' t listen to what men say , but watch their actions .
understood ?
lsn' t that right , mr. chu ?
your daughters aren' t bad .
your daughters are fine , too .
mine are no good .
my oldest is in the middle of this nasty divorce .
her husband was so sordid .
he fools around with several other women .
i can' t even mention the details .
and there' s my youngest with her white husband ... ... who plays electric guitar in the garage all weekend .
he eats hamburgers with onions every day .
and when i fry rice , the smoke alarm goes off !
i tell you , it was like a living hell there for me .
mr. chu , i' m sure you don' t mind , do you ?
of course not .
please .
old witch .
a breeze blows in ... ... fluttering through your clothes , across your smile .
in a dreamy garret , i am keeping my late autumn love for you .
late autumn love ....
so many times , i want to say ' i love you '
so often , i want to say ' i' m sorry '
you cried , ' this is fate .
it' s over '
it' s over
how are you , teacher ?
but give me just one moment
one more look
don' t take everything away
another chance
a little tenderness
don' t let me hurt so bad
you can make me happy
make me sad
make me willing to give you ... " ... everything
thank you .
thank you .
i' m new here , so i' m not familiar with everyone .
so i nominate teacher chu for a song .
be careful .
teacher , what do you want to sing ?
that won' t be necessary .
i' il sing love' s commandments .
love is forever , patient , and kind
love isn' tjealous
love isn' t boastful or crazy
love doesn' t do shameful things
a soprano !
you have a great voice .
you , too .
i wanted to ask you a question .
are you free this sunday ?
i' m taking the volleyball team on an outing .
do you want to come ?
an outing ?
you should get some sun .
join us if you' ve got nothing else to do .
think about it , and let me know .
bye !
don' t crowd me !
be quiet !
what do you want ?
curried beef and rice .
and you ?
fried rice with eggs .
it' s too easy for grandpa chu .
he won' t do it .
something more difficult .
here is mom' s lunch box and tomorrow' s menu .
bye .
you' re right .
the sydney route is worth half as much as they' re asking .
to think that the chief was going to offer $30 million .
great .
this is why you get paid the big bucks .
no wonder you' re so tired all the time .
you should try it .
in one morning , i' ve already killed 2, 000 aliens and saved the world .
what did you accomplish this morning ?
a small headache .
how could you kill those cute aliens ?
i remember now .
forget it .
you have time to give me a hand ?
sure .
i always wanted to find something chinese for him .
he has plenty of these already .
he' s interested in chinese culture ?
i wish .
i can' t believe that in a few years , my son is growing up to be an american .
sometimes i look at him and wonder if he' s actually my son .
he was raised in america , and his mother doesn' t mind .
his mother ?
how does she feel about you being away all the time ?
she' s glad i' m not around .
i think the only reason we' re not divorced ... ... is that we' re both too busy .
that sounds so cynical , doesn' t it ?
i' m just as cynical when it comes to my personal life .
sometimes i wish i could just ....
pick up and fly away .
seems like that' s what you' il be doing pretty soon .
i thought that was the answer , too .
as a result , i really messed things up after i graduated from chen kong .
chen kong university ?
yeah .
after graduation , my old man had a post for me in his chemical business .
chemical ?
that' s right .
remember the whiskey lab ?
i actually enjoyed it as a subject .
it' s the chaos in my life .
there was a lot of pressure from my parents , my girlfriend .
i guess i didn' t have the courage .
so i left .
then you went to the u. s. ?
it wasn' t great , but it was better for everyone in the long run .
you okay ?
this looks chinese .
that' s harvey .
you have no idea how much i suffered from those kids ' shows .
wanna hear the theme ?
" i love " please don' t .
what the hell , i' il just buy this one .
he' il like it .
uncle chu !
jin rong , what' s wrong ?
is it the detective ?
no .
shan shan is not feeling well .
she won' t be going to school .
so you ... ?
i was wondering why her lunch box was always so clean .
no one could ever finish all my short ribs before !
hope you don' t mind .
of course not .
but what about the lunches i' d prepared for her ?
i ate them myself , down to the last bite .
how embarrassing .
a master chef like you , eating my lunches .
i was more than happy to .
besides , i lost my sense of taste , so it' s the feeling that counts .
all right .
i should go now .
don' t tell shan shan that i know about this .
she' d like a little secret between you two .
yes , i understand .
bye .
i loved him so much .
how could he do this to me ?
you hardly cared for him .
i was only pretending ... ... because my love for him was so strong !
i was scared of its intensity .
i feel humiliated !
i went to see him , and he ....
i don' t want to live anymore .
if i only knew , then i wouldn' t have ....
i thought you two ....
chu jia ning .
you ....
you two ....
dad , do you need any help ?
call your sisters to dinner .
dad ....
go .
can' t they stop for once ?
it' s so annoying .
we communicate by eating .
so what' s wrong with singing karaoke ?
i have an announcement to make .
i know it sounds incredible ... ... but a lot of times things happen this way .
which class did you fail ?
i met a boy .
a man .
we' re in love .
we plan to live together .
his family has a huge apartment , and his parents will like me .
so i plan on moving in with them .
but the main reason is ... ... i' m having his baby .
bye , dad .
that jia ning .
i' m still in a state of shock .
do you think dad' s okay ?
where' d he go ?
he' s probably chatting with mrs. liang .
don' t worry about him .
take off to amsterdam .
just do what you have to do .
go ahead .
i really meant it .
sis , do you ever think about what might have been if you had stayed with ... ... what' s his name again ?
li kai .
had you left to the us with li kai after graduation ... ... what things might have been like ?
why are you asking ?
your life could' ve been different .
what' s wrong with my life now ?
do you want to be stuck here forever ?
what if i told you i saw  that' s enough .
this is my home , and it' s fine .
this is my home , and it' s fine , " but it isn' t everything !
but it' s dad' s everything !
i know him far better than you do !
why is it that you feel that you have to meddle in my life ?
what gives you the right to tell me what to feel ?
that' s right ... ... my heart was broken by li kai .
and you probably think that i' m pathetic for never getting over it .
but at least i had a heart to break .
i don' t need your pity .
and what do you know of my heart ?
nothing whatsoever ... ... because you never felt that i was worth sharing your feelings with .
you' re wrong .
ever since mom died , you acted more like a parent than a sister .
you shut me out .
i thought you hated me .
never .
i broke the plate .
it' s okay .
hi , if it' s bo kang , stop calling me .
if it' s mom , get dad to drink the healthy tea .
everyone else , please leave a message .
okay , leave a message .
hi , grace .
please call me when you hear this message .
nothing really urgent , but ... ... we haven' t spoken
congratulations , vice president !
congratulations !
your promotion is official !
my family' s from the hunan province .
after the war , my husband and i moved to shanghai .
there was a tong de girls ' school in shanghai .
we lived behind that alley .
my husband also loved to cook .
he was just very unlucky .
after we came to taiwan , he got stomach cancer and passed away .
i also had to fight tooth and nail to bring up my children alone .
it' s not easy , mr. chu .
and look at them now .
their wings grow stronger and stronger .
they do as they please .
they could care less about you .
it' s so not worth it .
that' s it .
i' il translate it first thing tomorrow .
and then you' re off to negotiate ?
probably in a couple of weeks .
i' il be in the states for a few days , then here , and finally to sydney .
i requested that you take a few days off to come with me .
i' il need you .
you' il do fine by yourself .
frankly , with your promotion now ... ... it' s really your decision .
you' re my boss , technically speaking .
wrong .
i am your boss , period .
yes , " boss .
what is it ?
don' t you know who i am ?
no .
call me chu jia chien .
okay , whatever you like .
call me chu jia chien !
have you completely erased my older sister from your memory ?
your older sister ?
that' s right .
my older sister .
chu jia jen is my older sister .
it' s only been nine years since your romance with her in college .
she' s still living in the past and refusing to marry another !
you' ve completely forgotten her !
chu jia jen ?
now you remember ?
i don' t remember this person , but i' ve heard that name before .
heard " ?
but i really can' t remember .
are you just pretending ?
if you feel embarrassed , then forget it .
there must be some sort of misunderstanding .
i wouldn' t deny it if i really knew her , whether she was your sister or not .
i need more information .
the chemistry department at chen kong .
what else do you need ?
that' s impossible .
there weren' t many female students in the chemistry department .
what' s she like ?
she was your girlfriend !
she gave you her first kiss !
i don' t know what else to tell you !
no , she wasn' t my girlfriend .
she wasn' t even in my class .
now i recall .
we were in the same department , but not the same class .
i think she hung out with jin feng .
you know jin feng ?
she was my girlfriend !
we broke up after graduation .
she married an american guy before i left for the states .
i saw her once in chicago last year .
now i know .
she often spoke of her best friend .
that must have been chu jia jen .
are you all right ?
you mean , she made it all up !
you' re lying .
why would i lie to you ?
how did this happen ?
she made the whole story up .
please be home .
raymond , so glad you' re home .
i just heard an absurd story .
raymond , who is it ?
no one !
i' m in a little ....
oh , i understand .
i' il call you tomorrow .
welcome back , chef wen !
stop kissing up .
back to work , you fools !
chef wen  just a second !
chef wen ?
where have you been ?
uncle wen passed away .
b , south , 7204 .
should be around here .
i don' t want tea .
i want water .
drink it , dad .
it' s your favorite mountain tea .
you' il feel better .
my taste buds are gone .
i prefer water .
why is she dressed like that ?
i love you , teacher chu !
can a single hand clap ?
even a ballplayer needs an opponent !
why do i only get to talk to thin air about love ?
who' s been writing these letters to me ?
if you have guts , step up !
who' s been putting disgusting letters on my desk every day ?
who ?
why hide if you had the guts to write them ?
i' m not gonna let this go !
i' il post the letters to check the handwriting !
i' il see where you can hide !
go ahead and hide !
what happened ?
teacher said she' d forgive us for writing the letters .
you guys really went too far .
the outing has been changed to next week .
will you be coming ?
here' s what i' il do , i' il sign you up for now .
if you' re busy , then let me know later .
i' m sorry those jerks hurt your feelings this way .
i' m sorry about the other night .
it was just a really confusing experience .
my mind was blank .
besides you , i didn' t know where else to go .
it' s all right .
i should be the one apologizing .
why should you be sorry ?
it' s your life .
in any case , i' ve made some decisions about my future .
i want to go someplace where no one knows me to get a fresh start .
i knew you could take care of yourself .
i also have a decision to announce about my future .
what decision ?
you know i' m not the type to settle down .
i' m still not sure about this .
nevertheless , it' s been ....
remember sophia ?
no ?
i' m sure i' ve mentioned her name to you a few times .
nothing serious in the beginning , until ....
you' re getting married ?
i would have told you about it sooner , but it was all so sudden .
she' s really changed my life .
maybe she' il also change my future .
it sounds more absurd than your story .
i didn' t know how you' d take it .
congratulations !
i knew you' d understand .
and i know you' il really like and admire sophia .
she' s quite a painter , a teacher ... ... and she' s also managing my gallery .
and she' s a great cook .
but you know , this marriage is not going to change my current lifestyle .
she' s moving into my apartment this weekend .
pretty much the same place , same job and the same life .
of course .
it' s 2 : 00 already .
i' d better be going .
to where ?
i' il take you .
i' m fine .
actually , i' ve got two hours to spare .
will we be continuing with our " friendship " status like before ?
i mean , you do know about the office in the back .
sorry .
i should go now .
let' s keep in touch .
please think about it some more , master chu .
the restaurant really needs your presence .
with so many good young chefs , you can easily find someone .
but none with the expertise in the art of chinese cuisine like you .
just your presence there would be a living , treasured cookbook .
do i just stand in the kitchen until i rest in peace , like old wen ?
it' s been said , " people die for money .
birds die for food .
to die for money is a man' s business ... ... but to die for food ?
that' s for the birds .
is it worth it ?
there' s truth to the saying .
but your life has been devoted to the art of cooking .
what a pity to just let it go .
people today are so insensitive .
they can' t appreciate the art of exquisite dining .
chinese cuisine has traveled to taiwan for 40 years .
and just like the rivers that eventually flow into the sea ... ... it' s all the same in the end .
even a mess of slop can pass for " joy luck dragon phoenix .
what more can i say ?
what is " pity " ?
only when a heart feels dissatisfied can it feel pity .
fortunately , i don' t plan on wasting my whole life on this stuff .
miss chu .
please help me to convince your father not to retire .
dad , you plan on retiring ?
it' s his own business .
he can make his own decision .
master chu , are you thinking of opening your own restaurant ?
be sure to let me know .
i' il follow you .
i see that mr. chu worries a lot about his daughters .
lsn' t that parenting ?
it' s harder for a single man .
it' s been so many years .
when did mrs. chu die ?
when jia ning was 4 years old , about 16 years ago .
a widower usually has a short life .
why didn' t he remarry ?
maybe because of the children .
he needs to wise up .
he' s raising his daughters for others .
only the ones nobody wants end up with you .
if you were so wise , you wouldn' t be haranguing over my divorce .
and you shouldn' t blame jin feng either .
what do you think of mr. chu ?
what about him ?
he seems like a nice person and a great cook .
he doesn' t talk much ... ... but we really connect .
i have a little announcement to make .
you know , just like jia ning , i ....
you' re pregnant ?
nonsense !
of course not !
but ....
it' s just that ....
we just couldn' t wait ....
he wants to ....
but i' m a christian ....
we asked the priest to marry us this morning .
hold on !
he' s waiting outside right now .
one second !
come in !
come in .
dad , jia chien , this is my husband , chou ming dao .
hi .
jia chien !
you scared me .
you' re gonna be late .
what are you doing ?
packing jia jen' s things .
let me help you .
i' m okay .
i loved this room when i was a child .
when your mom wanted some peace and quiet ... ... she also liked being in this room .
mrs. liang says this room is airy and has plenty of light ... ... and it would be the perfect place for an exercise bike .
mrs. liang ?
i went to jin rong' s place last night and told them jia jen' s news .
i' m running late .
i' il be back early from work .
don' t move any more stuff until i get back .
let me tell you ... ... kids are creditors collecting for the sins of our past lives .
they know no compassion .
it' s better off not having any .
life is a boundless sea .
only returning to shore is happiness .
marriage is a source of sin .
a series of worries , disappointments , misery , conflict and ingratitude .
i tell you , every family has a book of unspeakable problems .
i have a cause for celebration !
jin rong' s divorce decree came through .
i should have it framed .
i want her to remember her mother' s words forever .
i warned her not to marry that bastard !
i' il have this divorce decree framed and hung on the bathroom wall .
you shouldn' t worry so much .
whatever will be , will be .
lnstead of thinking about those creditors , why not think more about yourself ?
be careful .
watch your step .
dad' s really willing to give the vase to me ?
not really .
but if you don' t take it , mrs. liang will .
what do you mean ?
she' s been here almost every night .
you' re kidding .
i decided not to go to amsterdam .
are you okay ?
be careful .
no problem .
he' s not christian .
why did you agree to marry him ?
he will be .
welcome .
table for one ?
i' m meeting someone .
sure , help yourself .
thanks for coming .
i thought you might not show up .
why not ?
the other night ....
what kind of tea would you like ?
what are you having ?
mountain tea .
same for me .
thank you .
you know , i understand what you' re going through ...
... although i can' t really explain it .
neither can l .
it' s complicated , but i can understand that .
thanks .
i heard that you turned down your promotion .
everyone' s shocked .
i hope i wasn' t a factor .
not at all .
well , maybe only a tiny bit .
i don' t know .
it' s a whole series of things .
a family wedding ... ... actually , two marriages , and someone passed away .
and a really bad investment .
all of a sudden , everything' s gone .
plus my father' s health .
so i' ve decided to stay with him for a while .
i think he needs me .
the chief asked me to try to change your mind .
but what the hell ?
it' s just a job .
i' m glad , you know ?
glad ?
that we didn' t make love .
not that i still wouldn' t want to .
but seeing you like this makes me happy .
i' m happy , too .
i think that we can be really good friends .
sure .
then , good friends ?
good friends .
when you were a baby , i' d spin this for hours .
you wouldn' t let me stop .
well , please stop now .
i' m getting nauseous again .
and i should go .
i told dad i' d help shop for sunday' s dinner .
why did dad send formal invitations ?
is it for guo lun and ming dao ?
he said he has his own " little announcement " to make .
mrs. liang ?
probably .
i think , unlike you and guo lun , they won' t rush their engagement .
so hopefully , he' il have enough time to think it over ... ... and realize what a nightmare she is .
but i don' t think he will fully recover from the shock of recent events .
had i known he' d go crazy , i wouldn' t have ....
don' t blame yourself .
he' s not going crazy .
he' s an old horse .
horses don' t get married .
what do you think ?
don' t just run around !
one of you chase it , and the other grab it !
over here , ming dao !
got it !
jin rong , mrs. liang .
grandpa chu !
a tie for your father and a bottle of good wine .
also for your father .
you shouldn' t have .
i should' ve been here earlier to help .
fine .
i hope we' re not intruding .
no , not at all .
in the name of jesus christ , amen .
come , a toast .
cheers .
please help yourselves .
everyone , please help yourself .
are you moving abroad ?
not anymore .
mom , what' s this ?
do you want some shrimp ?
it' s a simple meal .
please help yourselves .
mr. chu , you' ve prepared too much .
help yourselves .
winter melon soup .
today' s red seven star fish was too big .
they' re best at 2 pounds .
listen to yourself .
so picky already .
you' il never find a husband when you grow up .
you girls are lucky .
your father' s a great cook .
look at this wonderful cuisine .
looks , smells and tastes good .
it' s all here .
jia jen ... ... you two , bottoms up .
jia ning , you two , bottoms up .
don' t drink too much .
i' m fine .
jia chien ... ... bottoms up !
fate has brought us to this table tonight .
that' s right .
although we' re not actually related ... ... we' re still considered family .
and since we' re one big family ... ... there' s really nothing we can' t say to each other .
i' ve kept this inside me for a long time .
it wasn' t as if i was trying to hide any secrets from you .
i just feel that i shouldn' t allow my personal affairs ... ... to be the family' s worry and , thus , become a burden .
as a family , living under the same roof ... ... we can still live separate lives .
this worry that we have for each other is what makes us a family .
i' ve done nothing wrong by not telling .
by telling , i can end this lingering .
i cannot live my life like my methods of cooking .
i can' t wait until all the ingredients are prepared and then cook .
of course , after the first bite , whether it' s sour , sweet or spicy ... ... it' s totally up to the individual .
that' s it for now .
i' il continue after dinner .
dad , what are you trying to say ?
we already knew .
you do ?
let dad tell us .
go ahead and say it .
the dishes are getting cold .
so be it !
since the situation has come this far , i' il say it .
to me , this house contains several old memories .
but now , it' s so empty , and almost everyone has left .
i' ve decided to sell it .
i found a really nice place on kum dao .
it' s a bit old and may require some remodeling .
but it' s a great place .
it should be ready in a few months .
great .
it' s always nice to move to a new place .
new people , new house , new life .
great .
i' il make a toast to you ... ... auntie liang .
i haven' t taken care of jin rong ... ... but i can swear to heaven ... ... as long as i , old chu , have one last breath ... ... i' il see that they both shall never go cold or hungry ... ... and that you' re always welcome in our new home .
take a look .
this is a medical report i had done at the veteran' s hospital last month .
please , auntie , we ask for your approval .
i' il first drink a toast .
cheers !
dad , you should stop drinking .
you' re getting drunk .
i' m not drunk .
jin rong .
uncle chu and i have been planning for a long time .
but because of this terrible divorce , our love was a secret until now .
although love should be between two people ... ... uncle chu loves all of you .
and he loves shan shan also .
so he really wishes for your approval and understanding .
as for me ... ... l only hope to be with him at his side .
i' m willing to be with him .
that' s enough !
don' t say anymore .
ls there a mistake ?
dad , are you crazy ?
i' m not crazy .
i know exactly what i' m doing .
mom ?
loosen her collar !
don' t touch me !
keep your dirty hands off of me !
damn you , old chu !
help carry her to the sofa !
be careful !
be careful !
damn you !
don' t touch me !
take me home , jin rong !
let me tell you , don' t even think about it for as long as i still have my last breath .
let' s go , shan shan .
mom , calm down .
let' s take her home .
okay , okay .
what kind of world is this ?
i want to die !
what kind of family is this ?
be careful !
i' il take shan shan .
god won' t let you get away with this !
i want to go back to america !
hello ?
guo lun , how are you ?
fine .
but we' ve been up all night .
i don' t have the heart to wake them .
don' t wake them .
get some sleep .
i' il be back again in a few months .
i' il come visit then .
bye , then .
tell us all about amsterdam when you come back .
and thanks for your help these past months .
take care of your wife and kid .
of course .
say hello to jia jen and ming dao for us .
they can' t make it either .
they' ve got a big day today themselves .
bye .
do you believe that jesus christ has forgiven your sins ...
... and made you a new person ?
yes .
do you believe in following jesus christ unto eternity and never regret ?
yes .
believe in your heart .
in the name of the father , son and holy spirit ... ... l baptize you .
amen .
how are you feeling ?
fine .
just a small headache .
you should get going .
all right .
i' il pick up shan shan on my return .
get some rest at home .
sure .
i love you .
sold
hi .
hi .
please come in .
you' il be the only one here tonight .
everyone else called to apologize , because they had plans .
where' s shan shan and jin rong ?
jin rong' s not feeling well today .
shan shan is with her grandma .
no need to take off your shoes .
just come in .
