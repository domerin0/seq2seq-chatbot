all that studying finally pays off , and you get to leave this hellhole a year early .

it' s like natural selection .
every hot chick you meet' s got a brain .

you never forget the sight of a dead body but then again , i was experiencing a lot of things for the first time .
i guess it' s just part of growing up .
how many calories in each stick ?
550 .
how many grams of fat ?
32 grams , but we do cook it in vegetable oil .
i' il take two then .
could i have mine extra crispy ?
sure .
no problem .
it' s not as hard as it looks .
all it takes is the extra five minutes reading the manual after you get hired .
the way i saw it , as long as it made it on my college application , it was all worth it .
you just can' t count on good grades to get into a decent school anymore .
virgil and i have been friends since the fourth grade , when he moved to my school .
he was the other smart kid .
let' s go , you perv .
dude , did you see the fucking rack on that ?
man , middle aged hos are the finest .
this is han , virgil' s cousin .
he' s everything virgil' s not .
you ladies ready ?
i shoot 215 free throws a day .
my goal is to beat calvin murphy' s record of 95 . 8 percent .
that' s 207 baskets .
punctilious .
marked by or concerned about precise , exact accordance with the details of codes or conventions .
to get a perfect score on my next sat
i needed to improve my verbal score by 60 points .
i picked a new word every day and repeated it over and over again .
they say if you repeat something enough times , it becomes part of you .
punctilious .
adjective .
marked by or concerned about precise , exact accordance with the details of codes or conventions .
oh , we could rock
or we could bomb
or we could try

i wanna spread my dementia
i wanna knock it off the line
give me attention
every day and every night
whoo hoo ...

stephanie vandergosh .
it' s girls like her that make you realize that life' s not fair .
i swear , i saw her in a porn .
what are you babbling about ?
daric loo , academic all star .
but don' t let the letterman jacket fool you it' s for tennis .
hey , so we' re using your credit card , right ?
if we get caught , i' m saying you stole it from me .
nigga , please .
the amoeba is a primitive and simple organism , which absorbs its prey and incorporates it into itself .
miss vandergosh and miss nabham , is there something you would like to share with the class ?
i thought as much .
uh , mr. farmer , please switch seats with miss vandergosh .
now that i have your complete attention , today we will see a movie .
it is entitled ' the amoeba ' .
lunch time was club time .
this was where everyone loaded up on their extracurricular activities for their college app .
and , of course , daric was the president of every club . ... but , being part of an ecology club , it' s important that we do .
unfortunately , all the really worthwhile things about high school were few and far between .
she is right down the hall
well , what i' m most concerned about are the abrasions on her arms and her back .
it was my fault ..
i fell down some stairs , but i feel fine now .
don' t get me wrong .
i mean , i think there' s some pretty fine looking bitches in high school .
it' s just that they' re all so fucking stingy about giving it up .
dude , you' re a fucking virgin .
dude , i can get laid whenever i want to .
any time , anywhere , any place .
yeah , by who , your middle aged aunt ?
no , but your mom' s been looking mighty fine lately .
hey , shut the fuck up .
especially with those ... what was that thing she bought the other day ?
okay , it comes to $482 . 82 .

yeah .
i thought you looked familiar .
i i' m virgil .
i was in , uh , cub scouts with your brother .
oh , this is my friend , ben .
hi .
hey .

i just got out of college .
oh , what was your major ?

i love the theater , you know .
it' s a ...
sign here .
that makes you , like , a thespian , right ?
you know , you you have that , like , kind of an " x " factor , that charisma thing .
you definitely got it going , really .
thanks .

let' s go .

hi .
hi .
it' s my little brother , and he came home with all this computer stuff he can' t afford .
so my mom ...
yeah .
do you have a receipt ?
it started with a pack of baseball cards , and then it snowballed .
i guess it just felt good to do things that i couldn' t put on my college application .
besides , it was suburbia ... we had nothing better to do .
our straight a' s were our alibis , our passports to freedom .
going to a study group would get us out of the house until 4 : 00 in the morning .
as long as our grades were there , we were trusted .
we had it all .
well , almost .
uncap the needle .
swab the finger with the rubbing alcohol .
prick the finger .

let' s go .

it' s amazing what the right piece of clothing can do for your image .
i knew it was all bullshit , but , hell , i was milking it for all it was worth .
at first it didn' t matter that i rarely saw any playing time .
i was part of the team .
but like everything else in life , you get sick of it .
at least it' il look good on my college app .
okay .

ain' t no party like a wildcat party .

so , ben , how do you feel about being a benchwarmer ?
what ?
well , you don' t get to play much , right ?
yeah , but we all have our roles on the team .
and what is your role ?
i don' t know .
i just hustle .
well , then how come you don' t get to play in the games ?
well , it' s up to the coach .
well , how do you feel about being the token asian on a team ?
what ?
it' s obvious to everyone the only reason that you' re on the team is for cosmetic ones .
that' s bullshit .
i bust my ass to be on this team .
but you never get to play .
so what ?
i' m still on the team .
well , your coach could' ve picked anyone he wanted to just to sit on the bench .
maybe you should just ask him then .
okay .
awesome .
thanks , buddy .
hey , takeshi , can you , uh , give me a few close ups and a couple wides ?
yeah , you got it .
hi .
is stephanie home ?
hi .
hey .
stephanie , i just want to apologize for ...
ben , i' m in three honor classes , and i have a 3 . 8 gpa .
i know and i' m sorry .
i couldn' t find the traits to phylum chordata in the book .
um , it' s not in the book .
it was in his lecture .

it was last tuesday' s lecture . ... cells .
this one is more of a non sexual cell division .
right .
okay .
and that' s when mitosis happens ...
that was one , anaphase ?
anaphase .
and then metaphase , interphase and prophase .

yes .
okay .
i think you' re right .

hey , ben .

we want ben !
we want ben !

daric ended up writing an article about me .
he even won some kind of journalism award for it .
it was some bullshit article about affirmative action in school sports to rile everyone up .
we want ben !
we want ben !
but i had to give it to him ...
the article worked .
if anyone at school didn' t know what affirmative action was , they did now .
aw sh ...
ben , ben , get in .
go on .
get the fuck in there .
yeah !
math or verbal ?
what the fuck do you want ?
so how does it feel to be famous ?
come on .
why' d you quit the team ?
i was doing my job .
you call that piece of shit article journalism ?
you didn' t even interview my coach for his views .
i did .
he , uh , didn' t say what i wanted him to , so i didn' t put it in the story .
fucking prick .
it' s just an article .
if you really liked what you were doing , you should have just kept on playing .
and have everybody think i' m on the team because i' m some token player ?
who cares what other people think ?
oh , yeah ?
well , people also think that you gave mr. reid head to be the editor of the school paper .
well , i still am the editor .
god .
fuck off .
you know this is all bullshit , right ?
it' s just a game .
people like you and me , we don' t have to play by the rules .
we can make our own .
do this by tomorrow , you get a fifty .

hey , i don' t just ask anyone to do this .
cheat sheets ?

academic decathlon was huge .
the most prized entry on a college application .
this was not like some community service club where you just walk in and sign out .

pygmy mouse lemur .

oh , my god .

yeah .

i don' t know .
hmm .
han told me that his parents don' t live here .
they' re in , like , vancouver or something .

i dare you to ask her boyfriend .
white dude , right ?
no .
thank god .
oh , yeah .
oh , yes .
shake those pom poms .
ben ?
huh ?
you think you can talk to daric for me about doing the cheat sheets ?
mm hmm .
uh huh .
how do you know about it ?
i hear things .
han told me .
fucking daric' s a senior .
someone' s got to take over when he leaves .
all right .
the topic is population control , why retarded children and handicapped people should be executed in order to keep the population down .
ready ?
is that true ?
i think it was .
' cause it didn' t sound like you knew it .
make sure your glasses are anti glare , okay ?
let' s see .
oh ...
decathlon practices were always held at daric' s house .
finish it !
finish it !
his methods were definitely unconventional but effective .
beautiful .
rock , scissors , paper .
oh , fuck .
i' m so unworthy at this moment .
ah ...
dude .
dude , dude , you' re gonna explode , man .
don' t light that shit .
come on .
oh .
good bye , guys .
study hard .
come on .
oh .
not bad for academic decathlon , huh ?
han had a friend named jesus who helped him steal , bribe or do whatever it took to get the test sheets for us .
i talked to daric and he was cool with virgil coming on board .
between the five of us , there wasn' t anything we couldn' t do .
the money was really good , but i don' t think that' s what attracted me the most .
okay , okay .
they got lucky .
but , you know , there is no reason a team of that caliber should be able to beat us .
god .
mary !
where' s your tie ?
i mean , our presentation absolutely sucked .
we looked like idiots .
rich , privy fucks .
press the button .
wait till the question is asked .
we' re getting locked out and we can' t even answer the question .
god !

fuckin ' a , that was better than sex .
just shut the fuck up .
did you see the look on that guy' s face ?
you put the fear of god in him , man .
the fear of gods .
i went jihad on his ass , man .
you see this blood on me , man ?
it' s not my blood .
did you see his face when we worked on him ?
it was like ...
fuck , man , when you pulled out that gun , it was fucking awesome .
that was , like , boom !
right in your face .
he probably pissed himself right then in front of all his homies .
not me , man .
i was going off .
i felt so ...
i felt like surging through my body .
how smooth was that ?
man , you had fucking balls !
that was fucking smooth !
the next minute , the gun was right in his face , and i was going off .. ah , yeah !
shit .
if my dad finds out , he' s going to kill me .
man , i' m going to juvie !
by monday , the word had spread and pretty much everyone knew about it .
i was sure the cops were gonna come and get us that morning ...
but it never happened .
meeting today at 3 : 00 .
why ?
we have to do this chem test .
it' s a big one , about a hundred students .
guys ...
hi , guys .
hey .
hey .
ben , can i talk to you ?
yeah .
he' s fuckin ' whupped already .
what' s up ?
i just talked to steve .
yeah ...
what ?
he said you' re taking me to the formal .
you' re fucking with me , right ?
he said that you guys agreed to have you take me to the formal .
he did ask , i didn' t agree .
the whole thing was pretty weird .
you should have at least told me .
well , he' s your boyfriend .
i didn' t want to get involved .
ben , that' s what friends do .
god , i don' t believe this .
why do i always get shit on ?
you know , steve , he' s the one that needs to stop ...
ben , i' m just trying to understand this .
i' m out of here .
what the fuck !
woo !
what ?
the formal ?
oh , what , got a hot date with barbie that night ?
look , i' m not gonna say anything , all right , it' s none of my business .
i just think she deserves better .
you' re probably right .
as our reputation grew , scams started coming to us .
usually through jesus .
there they are .
what i liked about it was that we were in control .
if someone came to us about doing a scam and we didn' t like them , we' d just tell them to fuck off .
having that kind of power quickly became an addiction .
what' s up ?
how' s it going , man ?
what' s going on ?
how are you doing ?
man , not too bad .
this is peter .
so , what' s up ?
peter' s got a sweet deal .
the school' s getting in all new computer parts next week .
so ?
so they' ve got to store them for a while until they can install them .
peter' s got the school codes .
can they trace the code ?
no , it' s all the same number for everyone .
what about that fucking family that lives in the trailer guarding the school ?
that' s me and my dad .
he' s out by 10 : 00 .
it' s easy .
i don' t know .
sounds too easy .
dude , i guarantee .
no offense ,
i don' t give a shit about your guarantee .
me and ben checked it out .
seems legit .
han , think you can sell this shit off ?
i can always sell the shit off .
we' il think about it .
peter , let' s go .
you got the phone ?
uh huh .
ah , god .
fuck .
it' s clear .
we had the run of the place .
rumors about us came and went fast and furious .
one had us linked with some chinese mafia .
and it was fine with us because it just put more fear in everyone .
along with that power came greed .
it just made sense to expand our business into drugs , putting the law of supply and demand into practice .
i think our teacher would' ve been proud .
whoa .
let me see this thing .
fuck off .
it' s got no name brand on it .
aw ... !
shit .
sorry , virg .
fuckin ' dick .
stop crying .
it' s a piece of shit cd player anyway .
fuck you !
here .
now you can buy three of ' em .
i soon learned that along with an image , came maintenance .
i needed something to help expand my days .
it' s literally a full time job just to make people believe who you' re supposed to be .
four cheat sheets a day , the drugs , the scams .. between this and all my club commitments ,
i couldn' t even start my homework until 1 : 00 a . m .
we were making so much money , we couldn' t spend it fast enough .
if it was for sale , you could bet we tried to buy it .
is that enough ?
mm hmm .
all right .
hey , tracy .
thanks , it' s all there .
thank you .
so , what are you guys ?
a club .
oh , like a math club or something ?
we partied every weekend and hung out with different crowds .
it' s funny , the more notorious we became , the more invitations we got .
we didn' t know half the people we partied with ... but they knew us .
quixotic .
adjective .
extravagantly idealistic ; unpredictable ; unrealistic or imaginary .
shit .
you look like shit .
fifty .
oh , yeah .
here' s the number for that internship
i was telling you about .
thanks .
yeah .
you want some ?
you happy , ben ?
i' m serious .
you happy ?
i don' t know .
fuck .
that' s the most truthful thing i' ve ever heard .
at least you have a choice .
you' re not happy ?
i' m very happy .
isn' t it obvious ?
i have everything .
loving parents , top grades ,
ivy league scholarships , of course , stephanie .
of course .
right there .
that' s it .
i' m so fucking happy i can' t stop it .
why not ?
it' s a never ending cycle .
when you got everything you want , what' s left ?
you can' t settle for being happy , that' s a fucking trap .
you got to take life into your own hands .
do whatever it takes to break the cycle .
that' s what it is , breaking the cycle .
you' re fucked .
i envy you .
what ?
what ?
what ?
what ?
it was my 17th birthday .
no shit , man .
fuck , man .
i don' t want to touch that .
i don' t want to touch it with my hands , man .
there he is .
hey , ass wipe , you' re the one that organized this " keep the beach clean " shit and you' re late .
i need to talk to you guys .
grab a bag .
where' s han ?
sleeping .
what' s up ?
this better be fucking good .
i want out .
out of what ?
i can' t handle this anymore .
look , i woke up and my sheets were covered in blood .
well , why don' t you stop
od' ing on that shit , you fuck ?
yeah , too much of that shit will get to you .
i don' t want to do it anymore .
all of it .
fuck , ben , stop being a pussy .
whatever , virg .
so is that it ?
yeah , i just ...
i just want to concentrate on my own stuff .
hell , i was thinking the same thing .
give it up ?
yeah .
fuck it .
it' s like a job , man .
the only reason i did it was for you guys .
what are you saying ?
have you two lost your fucking balls ?
fuck it .
han and i will do it .
right , han ?
it' s all yours , man .
we got to talk .
just shut the fuck up .

and you .
he thinks you' re fuckin ' dickless .
no ?
well , why else would he let you take his girlfriend to the formal ?
no .
no !
we' il just rough ' em up a little bit .
mostly ... we' il scare the shit out of him .

steve was meticulous .
he had mapped out each of our paths for the robbery .

i just don' t know what stephanie found so attractive .

his parents had left for tahoe a day earlier .

you know how you make decisions that lead to other decisions ?

then you realize you don' t remember why you made those decisions in the first place .
yeah .
when i saw you on new year' s eve ,
i knew there was only one right thing to do .
for the first time in my life ,
i don' t know what my future will hold .
i don' t even know what the other guys are going to do .
all i know is that there' s no turning back .
all i know is that there' s no turning back .
you said you had no place to go
while standing in the doorway of our home
and i' m here waiting to see
if you' ve come and found the key
i went and put it where it used to be
but i' m not waiting on eventually
no , i' m not waiting
are we only scraps
of everything we hoped that we could be ?
and i' m not waiting on eventually
no , i' m not waiting
build your house from scraps
make a home out of laughs
build your house from scraps
