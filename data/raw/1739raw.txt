during world war ii hundreds of czechoslovak pilots fought with the british against the nazis .
after the war the communists seized power in czechoslovakia and jailed the pilots who had returned home .
they feared these heroes would once again fight for freedom .

hanichka , please open the door !
papa ...
good evening .
captain !!
mr. pechar , let me explain ...
they' re repeating it over and over .
at six a . m . on march fifteenth the armed forces of the german reich will begin occupying our country ,
any resistance will be met with brutal retaliation ,
i' m sorry .
cry all you want . who wouldn' t ?
all units will be disarmed ,
no aircraft , military or civilian , are to leave their bases ,
turn it off !
cut the engine !
i' m taking it to poland . we can' t let them have it !
pilot officer , switch off your engine now !
didn' t you hear the order ?
yes , but i didn' t like it .
nobody' s asked your opinion .
get out ! why did you think the others aren' t taking off ?
because it' s suicide in this weather !
you' il crash into the first hill !
i know .
everything is conspiring against us .
england , france , the weather , even my back , everything . we should tell our men the poles will need pilots , ground crews too ,
because poland is next in line .
nothing official .
volunteers .
preferably , single men .
they' re here .
slama , please take over .
i can' t move .
let' s call it an order .
yes sir .
good morning gentlemen .
ober lieutenant hesse !
it' s my duty to take over this airfield .
our commanding officer , wing commander skokan is physically indisposed .
i' m in charge .
lieutenant slama .
this whole army seems " physically indisposed " .
what a lovely map !
so , yesterday we were here . we had a good look at your famous defences .
abandoned without a shot ?
as a soldier , i can' t understand it .
sir , kindly do your duty and respect the honor of soldiers who have been forced to do theirs .
keep your shirt on .
just a little joke .
now , i' d like to see the planes .
gentlemen !
the keys , please .
all right boys , let' s go .
i can imagine how you must feel .
a german officer would put a bullet in his head .
but you are ... a little different , aren' t you ?
pilot officer voytishek !
i' ve got a spare seat .
thank you , but i' il stick with the boys .
you' re taking it too personally .
how else !
i felt like throwing up in the hangar . we carried out an order .
now we can go home , take off our uniforms , and take it personally .
how long will it take you to pack ?
me ?
no time at all .
don' t forget to brush out her ears .
thistles get stuck in there .
she' il be grateful .
and in winter ice forms on these hairs between her pads .
they hurt her , so you have to cut them out .
but i' il be back well before then .
she' il listen to me ?
of course .
she knows you' re a part of me .
what' s this ?
in case you come back at night and the house is locked .
thank you .
you don' t have any documents on you ?
in case we' re searched ?
no , mr slama .
good .
and call me franta .
and you can call me karel .
i know .
i don' t know how to put it ...
sir , i mean franta ... but i do have some documents i' d like to take with me . what are they ?
no , forget it , i' il get rid of them .
you' d only laugh at me .
no , i won' t .
promise .
let' s see them .
horses ?
that' s only camouflage .
there' s worse .
she' s my only girl .
i' d rather not part with her .
your only girl ?
then you should keep her .
thanks .
sir ,
i mean franta !
look !
oh god !
barcha , you mustn' t do this .
go home .
go home !
back to hanichka .
go home !
go or i' il hit you !
what' s she doing ?
she keeps turning around but she is going back .
england , 1940
i can' t see shit .
shut up !
we' re pedaling like maniacs .
this is stupid .
i' m knackered !
behind you !
break left !
you bastards . why don' t you let us fly !
what' s he saying ?
get up . we' re doing it again .
no !
to hell with this !
it' s not what i came here for !
on your bikes !
out of my way .
what' d he say ?
he says you' re myrtvy .
thanks .
may i keep her ?
one week .
it means le ... lend , stupid .
shut it !
open your mouth wider !
no language !
just madness .
stop fooling about , karel .
ladies !
excuse me , a fortnight without just isn' t healthy .
a little well in an open field ,
i' m trying to do your mouth , so shut it ! why don t we go to the beach sometime .
i' ve never swum in the sea .
it' s freezing .
just to dip our toes .
hey .
look ! what do you think he' s saying ?
he' s trying to land them .
i' d just get a slap in the face .
you mustn' t frighten them .
machaty begins by asking the way .
say , to the officers ' mess .
but doesn' t he know where it is ?
it' s a device . women like to help you when you' re in trouble when ... they don' t feel threatened .
it' s how you break the ice .
did machaty tell you that ?
it' s common knowledge .
great !
i guess english is important after all .
there' s no resemblance .
you just shut up deadman . with your name you don' t belong in a plane but a coffin .
this supposed to be me ?
yes , i' d like you to have it .
grinning like an idiot for this !
it' s only good to scare kids !
what did he say ?
monkey catching .
us ?
makes sense . we' ve done just about everything else .
lift up your shirt .
were you in france , when we invaded ?
yes .
and what did you think ?
how you moved !
breathtaking .
don' t breathe .
blitzkrieg .
a short and sweet war .
take a deep breath .
it was hard to be a german and not be proud .
you can breathe now .
the english returned from their missions with empty magazines , and all we could do was circle the airfield , target shooting ,
three months later ...
lend me another to do the tits .
this one ?
no , i need her .
a little well , made of stone , in an open field stands alone ,
and its water is ,
that' s us you idiots !
finally !
show yourselves , bastards !
there they are !
two o' clock low !
oh shit !
boys , don' t jump the gun ,
fire only when they' re squarely in your sights ,
shit !
boys !
messerschmitts !
a whole swarm of them !
tom tom , on your tail !
i can see him ,
but he' s glued to my arse .
boys , you noticed , i don' t stutter when i' m shit scared ?
tom tom can' t bail out !
n2 , roger .
n3 , roger ,
move yourself , bastard !
n2 !
dive to sea level !
i can' t hear you .
dive to sea level ,
too little fuel to follow you !
what ?
bedrich , we' re not fighting anymore , it' s beddy byes now .
the germans are also beddy byes , they' ve stopped firing .
even hitler is beddy byes with eva braun .
lying on your heart is no good , it can give you nightmares .
look at sysel , sleeping nicely on his back .
good old moravian pig ...
we have different things in mind . what do you mean ?
i want ... you know what ... and she just wants to teach me english .
she says after the war ... for the other .
the one next to her doesn' t look as if she' d need to wait for peace .
she' s more than i could handle .
and her ?
she' s machaty' s .
she' s your date ?
you said it !
it' s amazing ... how calm they are .
and that' il be hitler' s downfall .
because he' s a hot head like our voytishek .
me a hot head ?
just you wait !
you know what' s crossed my mind ?
what ?
maybe i' m not handling her right ,
we go for long walks , she doesn' t stop talking ,
of course we kiss but ,
do you think she expects me to pounce on her ?
i wouldn' t know , but shut up for now , okay ?
but think about it , will you ?
sure ,
franta ! what ?
i see him ,
one o' clock , hugging the ground ,
he' s yours , karel ,
i' m going in ,
franta , i' m hit !
can you hear me ?
karel !
oh god !
out of the way !
i' il start her up .
are you alright ?
in hospital ?
stitched up his stomach . who' s that ?
sysel .
he was holding his guts .
it was oozing blood .
he' il be there for a week at least .
you land on your head when you bailed out yesterday ?
not on my head , on a woman !
and i fell madly in love with her .
i' m crazy about her .
really ?
i' m going mad .
one could ...
one could escape from here .
i' d like to know how .
you see that barbed wire over there ?
if one got hold of a pair of pliers ...
the wall' s only five meters .
gentlemen .
it' s my birthday today .
fifty .
your health , doctor !
my father died at fifty .
also a doctor .
in reichenberg .
you know how many people came to his funeral ?
a hundred and twenty seven .
my sister counted them all .
they loved him so .
that' s life ...
how many people did you kill in the war , mr. slama ?
no idea .
take a guess .
maybe ten .
me , not one .
have you ever seen an execution ?
i did .
in prague .
at kobylisy .
i had to check that the people were dead .
for a whole month .
day in day out .
how do i look ?
ravishing .
really ?
you' re pulling my leg ?
get out , you romeo .
wait here .
i' il give you a sign .
lovely , isn' t she ?
i prefer bigger tits , but she is pretty .
how do you say " vinegar " in english ?
well , what do you think ?
beautiful , karel .
really beautiful .
not asleep , honza ?
jura sysel died , so i' m scoring his favorite tune for the english to play at his funeral .
there are so many parts , the clarinet , all the brass ... it takes some doing to sound right .
keep at it ...
know what i' m sad about ?
no . what ?
i really liked sysel , but i never told him .
men don' t talk about such things but i' m sure he knew .
he couldn' t have , because i didn' t know myself .
he got on my nerves .
his moravian yodeling really pissed me off .
it' s only now i know i liked him .
let' s get some sleep .
in war men should tell each other how they feel .
nothing wrong with him .
just his face smashed up . we' il get him in the morning .
honza ?
who messed you up like this ?
kolichek .
he hit me ...
i hit the stove .
herr commandant has a hard stove .
he' s a snake .
check my fingers .
god i hope my fingers are all right .
they' re okay .
you' il play again .
00 : 58 : 23, 660 > 00 : 58 : 26, 015 they are all the same .
the same blows .
nazi interrogations , communist interrogations , no difference .
also a pilot ?
it' s machaty , the pianist .
so tell me herr slama why are you all locked up in here ?
i understand why i' m here . we lost the war and must be punished .
but you ?
i don' t understand .
what did you do to them ?
nothing .
nothing ?
but what were you tried for ?
there was no trial .
well , well , machaty .
back in england i bet you never dreamt they' d welcome you home with such a sad song .
you said it .
had you known , you wouldn' t have fought us so ?
that' s where you' re wrong .
did she say anything about me ?
she said you were sweet .
sweet , sweet ...
something she didn' t like about me ?
no , nothing .
you can' t drive in this fog . who' d i bump into ?
no one drives in such fog .
some other love sick idiot like you ?
i have to see her .
listen to me .
maybe she' s worried that i' m ... too young ?
did she say i was sweet once or twice ?
six times , you fool .
go on then .
but be careful .
can you believe it ?
she wasn' t home .
a strange woman was there . where did you sleep ?
in the car .
she went to see her brother in london .
why do i have to get the shits before each flight ?
better before than during .
blue four .
my engine is playing up .
permission to return to base , franta ?
what' s the problem ?
it' s misfiring , losing power .
permission granted ,
you might call them small tits , but you should see them !
messerschmitts !
franta , watch out !
get among them so they can' t aim !
tally ho !
karel , get him !
well done , karel ,
go lower , machaty ,
take the one in the back ,
machaty , watch your back side !
when goliath spits in his eye ,
david swings his sling ,
one was big and one had courage ,
goliaaath !
my first !
it' s my first !
there' s something i' ve got to tell you .
no , franta .
it' s important .
i need to talk to you .
karel , listen .
no , listen to me !
you listen to me !
it' s so nice to be in love .
she may not want me , but i' m still happy .
maybe a little unhappy too , but still happy .
are you asleep ?
look , karel ...
remember when you went to see her 01 : 06 : 52, 300 > 01 : 06 : 54, 495 in that terrible fog ?
susan ... came here to see me .
i told her we were best friends , and sent her away .
i was afraid to tell you then .
but you should know , even if it hurts .
i' ve a really bad toothache .
you' re not going up today ?
i must see the dentist .
know what the mechanics call you ?
boomerang .
takes off and comes right back . when your engine' s ...
there' s nothing wrong with your engine .
they checked it .
i can' t help it .
i get diarrhea before each flight and throw up when we land .
i only eat what comes up easily .
porridge , custard ...
you could apply for a transfer to the ground crew .
no one would blame you .
you mean not fly anymore !
i' d be the first to regret it .
i feel safer having you behind me .
i' il see the dentist tomorrow .
and all the way , i kept asking myself , why was i going there ?
the only answer was that
i wanted her to write karel a kinder letter ,
to give him some hope ,
yes , that was it ,
but i forgot it was sunday ,
visiting day for the parents of susan' s evacuees ,
where were you ?
in london .
at the embassy .
get into a fight there ?
no . why ?
your button' s missing .
really ?
i' il ask pierce to see to it tomorrow .
that' s my locker .
i am sorry karel .
i' m really sorry .
so goering has three balls ?
no !
two , but small .
so , hitler has one , goering two ...
but small .
so who has none ?
you , mrtvy , you have none !
franta , that' s us !
let' s go , old man .
achtung , die spitfiren !
come back , it was only me !
you arsehole .
see the train ?
shall we give the driver a chance ?
and the stoker ,
okay , let' s go .
you take out the engine , i' il go for the tanker wagons ,
watch out for that atack gun !
karel !
can you hear me ?
can' t see , belly landing ,
shit !
you wait here ! we' il check on the peasants .
where is the pilot ?
do you understand ? where is the english dog ?
plane kaput .
dog out .
plane boom ... and dog run ... there ...
let' s go !
jeannette !
get up !
it' s over !
they' ve gone !
get up !
it' s over , they' ve gone !
get in !
climb in !
don' t be a fool , franta , there' s no room !
shut up and get in !
hang on !
you' re sitting on my arm !
can you reach the throttle ?
i can' t .
how' s the fuel ? wouldn' t know ?
i can' t see the gauge .
neither can l !
stop fidgeting ,
i think you' ve dislocated my shoulder !
you' re crazy !
stop moving around !
what' s your code name ?
and the emergency frequency ?
next time , on the back .
that' il smudge when you sweat .
good luck .
thanks .
be careful !
so , the dentist ? worse than war .
the man' s a maniac . why ?
just pulls teeth out ,
good or bad !
pleased to hear it . what ?
that you don' t have toothache anymore .
i see .
you' re going to fly in pairs .
you' il look after the new chap .
me ?
yes , you .
take care !
not only is it dark around me , but i cannot see ,
i know there is darkness all around but i cannot see it ,
that' s beautiful .
my god that' s beautiful .
it is , but i can' t play it forever .
oh yes , you can .
it' s the only one i want to hear .
will you teach me to play it ?
all right .
i wanted a piano .
but ...
my dad said he' d buy me an accordion instead ... said it also had keys .
it' s true , a piano doesn' t really belong on a farm .
you start playing and you get the cows mooing along .
you' il teach it to me ?
i will .
but now it' s time for bed .
not yet .
once more .
one last time .
okay , one last time .
you haven' t finished your drink yet .
so , tell me , where ' s my perfect vision gone ?
the dense blue cloud now covers all , the impenetrable dark blue world ,
what are you celebrating , you night owls ?
don' t i get a drink ?
tell him .
he' s not going to fly with you anymore .
you bastard !
i' il kill you .
i was always so afraid i' d lose you .
but this is worse than if you had died on me .
forgive me , karel , if you can .
i didn' t want this .
bedrich , bail out !
you' re on fire !
bedrich ' s still inside ,
what are you doing !
karel ?
karel landed ?
yes , but bedrich' s missing . where is he ?
i don' t know .
what got into you ?
i' il kill you !
think i don' t know ?
firing at me from behind !
son of a bitch !
fired at me full on !
over a woman !
can you believe it ?
a german soldier could not do this .
to his own comrade .
i' ve lost a lot of respect for you , herr ober lieutenant .
very much .
have you never met a woman who made you lose your senses ?
no woman could do that to me .
then i' m sorry for you .
i' m sorry for you .
for you comradeship is nothing but a bubble .
you blow at it , and it' s gone .
01 : 26 : 12, 660 > 01 : 26 : 17, 814 we mightn' t like each other but we' re all in the same boat .
i' ve searched my instruments and can' t find the pliers .
there' s only the three of us .
if they find them on someone , know who' il get it ?
me .
shall i report it and have them turn the place over ?
i can' t do it .
but ...
look out !
commandant , sir .
three patients and one doctor present !
x ray essential ...
so what is this i hear blaschke ? what x ray ?
i reported that machaty sustained a head injury .
i was worried about a brain haemorrhage .
you know how he did it ?
yes .
he fell against the stove .
and that' s precisely what you' il write in your report .
sir , permission to speak ?
speak , if you must .
as machaty' s former superior officer
i urge you to permit an x ray .
son of a bitch , back at work on monday .
sharp !
flying officer mrtvy is probably dead ? " you can' t say that !
he' s " missing in action " and " presumed dead .
that' s better .
perhaps " good " instead of " brave " . why ? well , they say he was scared .
maybe .
but he flew all the same .
that' s why he was brave .
i' d like to talk to you , karel .
there' s something i want to say to you .
your superior officer is addressing you .
behave accordingly !
i want to apologize to you , in front of all present , for accusing you of firing at me .
i was bloody stupid .
you saved my life when you shot down that messerschmitt and i' m grateful .
i respect you and regret any pain i' ve caused you .
i' d be glad if you could forgive me .
and stop drinking and staying up all night .
you fly exhausted and senselessly risk your life .
do you accept my apology ?
let it go , karel .
shake hands , you clowns .
to , captain otakar mrtvy of squadron ,
dear captain ,
we regret to inform you that your brother , bedrich mrtvy , is missing in action and presumed dead .
it happened on 23rd september during combat with the enemy ,
he was a brave pilot ,
he will remain in our hearts forever .
a little well , made of stone in an open field stands alone ,
keep moving .
keep moving .
and then we began to escort the americans ,
karel moved quarters ,
his only words to me in 3 months were " yes sir " on the radio ,
i wrote begging him to forgive me ,
but a wounded soul heals slower than a wounded body ,
what' s wrong , franta ?
my engine' s conking out .
i' m about to take a swim ,
see you , boys .
red two , stay with him and report your position ,
karel is with him , sir ,
roger ,
is anyone listening !
take a fix on my signal , you idiots !
shit !
go home , karel .
you' il run out of juice .
what are you doing , you fool !
my instruments are in such a mess !
thank you , gentlemen .
my idea of getting out of here ...
they put me up to it .
they wanted to pin something on you so they could beat you up .
what was in it for you ?
i' d get out earlier .
the best thing about all this is , you' re not such a bastard .
barcha ?
don' t you know me ?
come here ...
hello .
franta ?
they said that ... that you were dead .
so you see ,
i' m not .
don' t cry .
no one' s to blame .
you are beautiful .
let' s go , barcha .
thanks for looking after her .
barcha !
she' s our dog !
really ?
barcha , come here !
barcha , come home .
stay then , barcha .
don' t be sad , franta ,
karel , is that you ?
sure ,
where are you ?
behind you , where i' ve always been ,
2430 czechoslovakians served in the royal british air force during the second world war .
