all right , smart ass .
who is he ?
new american ambassador ?

he' s got a wife , but no one seems to have a picture of her .

i did some checking .
she' s french .
married before , with a kid .
i got an ex i don' t talk about .

so you want me to nail her , right ?

hi .
i' m sorry to bother you , but i rented this room last night ...
... and i think i left my disk here .
disk ?
when i got home , i checked my laptop , and the backup disk was gone .
it' s the only copy i have .
i searched like hell for it .
then i remember , the only place i could' ve left it was here .
do you mind if i take a look ?
i don' t think it' s a good idea
thank you very much .
thank you .
i appreciate it .
thank you .
oh , my god , i got so much information on that disk .
you didn' t see a disk , right ?
actually , it' s not a disk .
it' s not like a cd or dvd or anything like that .
it' s called floppy .
it' s like a black thing you introduce in the computer .
i am remembering now that i put it there .
because i was working in bed .
i love , i just love to work in bed .
i bet you do too .
anyway , let me just remember exactly what i did .
i just i sat over here .
oh , my
i sat over here , put it on my lap because it' s a laptop and plug it over there .
you know what happened ?
it happens that i wasn' t alone .
i wasn' t alone , and
oh , my god !
that' s not your business .
well , no , it' s not .
it' s not , but it is .
because ....
excuse me .
are you all right ?
i think i can help you .
i have been working in a hospital , i' m a candy striper .
sit down .
give me your arms .
and relax , relax !
and breathe .
breathe and relax .
and now listen to me .
listen to me good .
i know .
i' ve been accused of having an overactive imagination ... ... but when a classy woman checks into an airport hotel ... ... in the morning with bullets and a gun ... ... there' s one word that follows .
what word ?
bang !
now , if a guy walks in , maybe there doesn' t have to be a bang .
maybe there is something to talk about .
coffee ?
well ....
maybe we should start with some introductions ?
i don' t care who you are ... ... and i don' t want you to know who i am .
all right , that' s fair enough .
let' s call me harry .
and let' s start with the shiner .
who is beating you up ?
must we talk about this ?
yes .
or we' re gonna go find a local police station , and we' il talk about it there .
my husband .
all right .
why ?
he has ... ... difficulty ... ... to control his temper .
why does he lose it ?
because i can' t live with him here .
why not ?
i have a past here .
i was safe in the states , but here , it only takes one photo .
like the one today .
i took that picture .
so harry is nicolas bardo .
why did you follow me ?
to get more photos ?
no , no , i ....
i came to tell your security goon , mr. shiff ... ... l couldn' t stop the picture from being published .
sorry .
anyone can see that .
you' ve wasted your time .
this espresso is cold .
can i get you another cup ?
why ?
there' s nothing more to say .
can i go now ?
you have the gun .
sex shops are open all day .
i don' t think i' il be going to one .
how can i be sure ?
just stay with me .
i need air , but i don' t want to talk anymore .
ladies and gentlemen , your attention please .
we advise you not to leave luggage unattended and to beware of pickpocket .
when i got divorced , i decided to come to paris to reinvent myself .
that kind of thing .
i' ve got these crazy photographer ideas .
don' t think i' m a paparazzi .
i hate it .
i feel like shit , but i have to make some money .
but there is a square here in paris full of coffee shops , beautiful .
this one particular with light reflections ... ... and i saw something that changed my life .
it' s a great story .
this is the best part .
i know , i know .
maybe another time .
it' s a great story .
but right now i' m very tired ... ... and i' d like to take a warm bath and relax a little ... ... before i go home , okay ?
thank you for today .
i' il be waiting out here , just in case you need anything .
you don' t trust me , do you ?
no , no , no .
it' s not that .
it' s just being careful .
are you all right ?
no .
i' m out of my medicine .
there was a pharmacy in the airport .
that' s right .
my
my inhaler is in my car .
they can refill it for me there .
that wouldn' t be being careful .
i ....
nicolas , take my car ... ... take my purse ... ... if you' re so worried that i go somewhere .
you can call a taxi .
come on .
yes , nicolas .
i could call a taxi ... ... but i' m not going to do that .
i' m not going to need these in the bath .
wait , wait .
hold it .
definitely not going anywhere without them .
are you flirting with me ?
was l ?
well ....
i believe so .
yeah .
i didn' t mean to .
it' s just that ... ... all your boyhood stories ... ... make you so ... ... damn lovable .
was that the point ?
well , it' s not mine , but somebody loaned it to me .
lay down .
this doesn' t make much sense .
i' m chief lnspector serra .
maybe you can help me out .
i said it already .
but , okay , all right .
mrs. watts is trying to kill herself .
i stopped her .
so she set me up for you guys , to get me out of the way .
that' s it .
how did you come up with that ?
i read a lot of mysteries , and i figure out the endings halfway .
i know what happened .
what happened , mr. bardo ... ... was a car belonging to ambassador watts was found in your possession .
i know that .
on the front seat was a gun , bullets ... ... a blouse and dress .
the only thing missing is the woman .
where is she ?
i don' t know .
i don' t know .
you check out the hotel ?
yeah .
we checked the room .
we found a naked waitress in a coma .
did you have anything to do with that ?
no .
no , no .
i wasn' t there .
i was buying an inhaler .
lnhaler ?
yes !
an inhaler .
an inhaler !
all right , mrs. watts has asthma .
so i went to a pharmacy to get her prescription refilled .
that' s it .
so you figured ... ... by having her car and clothes , she wasn' t going anywhere ?
that' s correct .
yeah .
and you kept the gun so she wouldn' t shoot herself ?
that' s right .
why would she want to do that ?
excuse me ?
why would she want to do that ?
well , her husband was beating her up because she wanted to leave him .
the american ambassador beats his wife ?
yes , that' s right .
yes , and she has the face to prove it .
you see ... ... l' m kind of a mystery buff myself .
and you know what kind of mystery this is ?
a kidnapping .
come on .
ambassador' s wife held for ransom .
everything was going fine until someone reported a stolen car .
you didn' t have time to send the ransom note .
no , no .
what are you talking about ?
no .
i am no kidnapper , sir .
why don' t we go to the residence and see what he has to say ?
i think this is a terrible misunderstanding .
i spoke with mrs. watts .
she explained how she let mr. bardo use her car .
i don' t know who reported it stolen .
it wasn' t .
my attorney has indicated to me that no crime has been committed .
so i' m a little confused as to what we' re doing here , inspector .
you spoke to your wife yourself ?
yes , i did .
could i speak with her ?
i don' t think that' s necessary .
this has been an awkward situation for all concerned ... ... and i really don' t want to prolong it .
mrs. phillips will handle your questions from now on .
i have an engagement .
please excuse me .
lnspector serra ... ... you' ve displayed a boorish lack of sensitivity towards the ambassador .
we do not need or want your investigative skills employed ... ... to discover why mrs. watts was in a hotel bedroom with mr. bardo .
i suggest you return to your duties and drop this matter .
the less said about it , the better .
i' d still like to talk to mrs. watts .
and what crime has she committed ?
no crime .
i just wanna see her .
well , i' m sure we all want to see lots of people .
but , fortunately , in our country and in yours ... ... they are not compelled to see us .
good day , inspector .
sir .
you know the penalty for a handgun ?
i told you , it' s not my gun .
then we' il just keep it .
now , about your motorcycle .
you really want to report it stolen ?
lf it wasn' t at the hotel , somebody took it .
why don' t you look a little harder ?
lf it doesn' t turn up , give me a call .
sir .
you don' t believe one thing i said , right ?
not only don' t i believe you , i don' t even like you .
look , bardo , i know who you are .
ex paparazzi smart ass , who hasn' t worked for seven years .
i don' t know what you' re up to , but it' s not smart .
keep it up and you' il wind up in a cellblock full of smart guys like you .
mr. watts , if you ever want to see your wife again ... ... bring 1 0 million dollars in bearer bonds to the passerelle debilly ... ... at 2 a . m . this morning .
lf you inform the police or arrive with anyone besides yourself ... ... she will be killed .
oh , shit !
son of a bitch !
mrs. watts .
call me lily .
okay , lily .
what the hell do you think you' re doing , lily ?
are you mad at me ?
mad ?
no .
you are making everybody think i' ve kidnapped you .
haven' t you ?
that is not funny .
no , nicolas .
you' re right , it' s not funny .
it wasn' t funny when you sold my picture either .
and then you showed up to do what ?
explain ?
apologize ?
lie ?
i was afraid for your life .
i felt responsible for it !
that' s so sweet , nicolas .
i' m a bad girl , nicolas .
real bad .
rotten to the heart .
last scrape i was in , i fucked up a lot of people .
bad people , people like me .
people that don' t forget .
but i was given a second chance .
so i went back to the states , where i got everything a bad girl ever wanted .
fucking watts .
he was kind of a sweet guy until being the richest man wasn' t enough .
he had to have public glory .
he gave away a ton of money , bought the ambassadorship ... ... which meant the little missis got dragged out in the parisian limelight .
well , i couldn' t do that , because bad people read newspapers too .
et voil .
enter my worst nightmare .
you snap that fucking picture , sell it to the tabloids ... ... and now it' s only a matter of time before those bad people come running .
so i got the photographer turned blackmailer to kidnap me .
blackmailer ?
you offered me money !
and i have never kidnapped anybody , you fucking bitch !
then where am i , nicolas ?
why did you have my car , my clothes , a gun ?
why was a ransom note e mailed from your computer ?
everyone knows you did it .
i' ve gotta think .
what ?
i' ve gotta think about
you don' t have to think about anything .
i' ve got it all thought out for you .
watts is coming up here at 2 a . m . with $ 1 0 million .
now , if you start being a little nice to me ... ... l might cut you in on the take .
we are going to the police .
why would you wanna do that ?
you' re gonna tell them the crazy story you just told me .
come on !
what , do you think i' m stupid ?
i' m not gonna tell them that story .
i' m gonna tell them the kidnapping story , starring you .
son of a bitch !
nicolas .
hold on , hold on .
i went back to that sex shop .
oh , shit .
come on .
what did you do with that other gun ?
the cops took it .
they did ?
yes , they did .
i got you another one .
come here .
be careful with that thing .
it' s all right .
nicolas .
lsn' t sugar better than vinegar ?
come on .
we have a couple hours , baby .
let' s go do something fun , you want to ?
hey , how come you' re the only man in this room that doesn' t wanna fuck me ?
what ?
nicolas , where are you going ?
i' m just going to buy some cigarettes .
don' t worry , i' m not going anywhere while you have my balls in your pocket !
pack of cigarettes .
anything american .
hi .
what' s your name ?
hey , nicolas .
come here .
meet my friend napoleon .
oh , yeah .
i think he' s in love .
can we just go outside ?
i need to talk to you .
come on !
we' re having fun .
just be cool .
i' m gonna go outside .
no !
nicolas .
we don' t want you to wait out in the cold .
do we , napoleon ?
i mean , if we hit it off
i thought of letting you off the hook .
really ?
yeah .
you don' t seem to be enjoying my company much .
maybe napoleon and i should sail off into the sunset ... ... and you can go fuck yourself .
i hope you didn' t kill him .
he was gonna save me from a dip in the seine .
what ?
we had big plans .
i was gonna go off the bridge into his boat .
big plans .
oh , poor lily , whatever happened to her ?
she must have drowned and washed out to sea .
thanks a lot .
you' ve ruined everything .
fuck you .
what' s the matter , nicolas ?
don' t i make you jealous ?
jealous ?
yes .
yes .
i was jealous .
i am jealous .
nicolas , you don' t have to lick my ass .
just fuck me .
you know what ?
what ?
we can still go away .
both of us , together .
that' s so sweet .
come here .
come here .
that' s so romantic .
but without the money ?
are you nuts ?
yes .
that' s a choice .
a bad choice .
there are other ones .
what , like doing the right thing ?
that' s a start .
i tried that once , nicolas .
and you know what it got me ?
a lifetime of looking over my shoulder .
you know why no good deed goes unpunished ?
because this world is hell , and you' re nothing but a fucking patsy .
i made everybody think you kidnapped me ... ... so i could screw my husband out of 1 0 million bucks .
that' s what it' s all about .
me disappearing with 1 0 million bucks .
so wipe it off ... ... and let' s go get it .
fuck you !
you' re not gonna hurt her , right ?
because i' ve done exactly what you' ve told me to do .
i brought the money ... ... and i haven' t talked to anyone .
don' t do anything foolish , darling .
i won' t .
he just wants me to take the money and bring it back to him .
okay !
watts , it' s nicolas bardo .
your wife is staging this kidnapping to take your $ 1 0 million .
lf you don' t believe me , i got it right here on tape .
what the fuck do you think you' re doing ?
you killed him .
i was just being careful .
fucking bitch !
you didn' t think i' d give you a gun loaded with real bullets , did you ?
baby ... ... there' s one more thing we gotta do .
oh , god !
somebody , help !
my husband .
fucking over everyone again ?
but not this time .
where are the diamonds ?
fuck you !
wake up , bitch !
before you die !
you know what' s in this ?
the bullet that' s going to spread your brains all over that wall .
you know how i know ?
look at me .
i' m your fucking fairy godmother ... ... and i just dreamt your future .
and mine too .
and all i know is ... ... if there' s a chance of any of that shit happening , we' re gonna change it here .
now listen .
i know you got a bad break , but you better forget it .
because if you can' t ... ... then you may as well go ahead and pull the trigger .
but if you don' t end it here ... ... and you get your ass on that plane to america ... ... your future will be sitting right next to you .
his name is bruce , and he' s a really good guy .
he' il look into your eyes ... ... and he' s gonna fall in love .
and after that , you' re on your own .
so , what do you say ?
do i pull the trigger ?
or do you get your ass on that plane ... ... and have a wonderful life ?
how do i know that you tell the truth ?
how do i know there' s a bullet in the chamber ?
are you dodging bill collectors ?
nick , asshole , it' s johnny .
i know who you are .
what' s up ?
trying to catch lightning in a bottle .
are you eating ?
barely .
like to make some real money ?
what are you selling , john ?
you know who bruce hewitt watts is ?
the new american ambassador ?
bingo .
he' s got a wife and three kids , but no one has a picture of them .
maybe they' re camera shy .
some people like to keep their home life private .
i know it' s weird , but they do .
did you find fucking god ?
you owe me , pal .
i guess i' il have to keep on owing you .
that' s your half .
a little under 4 million .
four ?
that' s the best i could do .
i had to fence them off one at a time .
sorry that it took so long , but it was the safest way .
not bad for a night' s work , huh ?
you call that work ?
bye , laure .
it' s best if we don' t see each other again .
excuse me , lady .
are you all right ?
it was an accident , it was terr
sorry .
i' m just a little shook up .
actually , you look like you need a drink .
drink ?
yes , come on .
i' m sorry ... ... you look so familiar .
have we met before somewhere ?
only in my dreams .
