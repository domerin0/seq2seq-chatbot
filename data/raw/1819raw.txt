you and greim must go as quickly as possible .
fly to dnitz .
tell him to do anything it takes to punish himmler .
we' ve decided to die with you .
thank you for this proof of loyalty .
but himmler must die .
he committed treason .
he' s no longer privvy to my plans .
mein fhrer ?
do you think i' il sit and wait until those jewish swine slaughter me ?
this is part of a huge decoy manoeuvre .
i' ve allowed the enemy ... ... to invade the reich and they think they' ve won .
but mark my words : they have another thing coming .
dnitz is mobilising in the north .
kesselring in the south .
we' il surround the enemy and crush them .
from prague , three armies will attack the russians , simultaneously , from the back .
i didn' t know we still had so many reserve troops .
i made sure you' il soon have a 1000 of the most modern ... ... jets at your disposal .
with those , you can make the luftwaffe ready for battle again .
i kneel to your genius , at the altar of the motherland .
heil , mein fhrer .
you also request to leave berlin ?
mein fhrer , as you know , all medical departments ... ... that fall under the ss and himmler , have left berlin .
himmler is a traitor .
he won' t escape punishment .
mein fhrer , as reichsarzt ss , i have no more work here .
your request to leave berlin is unacceptable .
my family ...
if the russians ...
i must leave .
you did nothing wrong .
future generations will thank you for you medical research .
i take all the responsibility .
we' il talk about it later .
gruppenfhrer fegelein cannot be found .
he' s not in the bunker .
what , you can' t find fegelein ?
keep searching .
i need to talk to him .
immediately .
if he left just like that , that' s desertion .
treason .
bring me fegelein .
fegelein .
fegelein .
daddy , why are you wearing your sunday uniform ?
ernst , is something wrong ?
no .
thank you .
brigitte is hungry too .
ilse , you should eat something as well .
thank you .
there you go .
thank you .
what is it ?
gruppenfhrer , you' re under arrest .
what ?
you' re suspected of desertion .
get dressed .
you' il come with us .
search the room .
let go of me .
you can' t give me orders .
you can' t have hermann executed , can you ?
there' s no doubt .
he wanted to flee .
what does it matter ?
everything' s over .
think of my poor sister .
she' s pregnant by hermann .
he collaborated with himmler .
he' s a traitor .
there' s no mercy for traitors .
no compassion for them .
he' il be court martialled and executed .
what' s the point of that ?
it is my wish .
you' re the fhrer .
speak .
the russians are advancing more and more .
there are no more reserves .
supplies from the air are impossible .
there is no ammunition coming in anymore .
in the north , the russians are standing in front of the weidendammer bridge .
lustgarten .
potsdammer platz .
tiergarten , about 400 metres away from the chancellery .
how long can you hold out ?
at most , two days .
including the government area ?
yes .
as a soldier , i suggest we flee berlin .
it' s surrounded .
the battle of berlin killed about 20, 000 of our best officers .
that' s what young people are for .
what you suggest is insane .
ridiculous .
think of the thousands of wounded .
we can' t help them .
mein fhrer , the orders have been written .
i give you my word ...
the fhrer cannot make a honourless disappearance from world history .
even if an advance is successful ... ... i' il end up in another troublesome situation .
i' d have to stay in the open air or on a farm ... ... and wait for the end .
wenck is advancing with the 12th army .
he can join the 9th ... ... and give the russians the final blow .
wenck' s an excellent fellow .
1 .
where are wenck' s vanguard located ?
2 .
when will they attack again ?
3 .
where is the 9th army ?
4 .
where will the 9th make a breakthrough ?
you' il see , gentlemen .
i' il be right .
wenck will come .
wenck will come .
i want to know if wenck can do anything at all .
it' s unlikely that wenck' s small amount of troops ...
what' s unlikely about the offensive ?
wenck can' t do anything anymore .
then why don' t you tell the fhrer that ?
has everybody gone mad ?
do you think the fhrer doesn' t know ?
he' il never surrender .
and neither will we .
i' ve been through that once .
never again .
come along .
i have to go .
stop right there .
heil hitler .
excuse me .
i fell asleep .
did you get some rest , my child ?
in shorthand .
my political will .
more than 30 years have passed ... ... since i made my contribution as a volunteer ... ... during the first world war .
during those 30 years , i learnt to think , act and live ... ... out of love and loyalty for my people .
excuse me .
the shooting .
please sit down .
centuries will pass ... ... but from the ruins of our cities and monuments ... ... the hatred of the people ... ... who did this to us , will continue to flare up .
international judaism and its allies .
what is it , herr minister ?
imagine this .
the fhrer wants me to leave berlin .
he ordered it .
i' ve never ignored an order from the fhrer .
but i will ignore this order .
i' il stay with the fhrer .
please , frau junge ... ... i want to dictate my will to you .
i' m typing the fhrer' s will .
good .
i understand .
some other time .
mein fhrer , are you of aryan descent ?
can i see your identity card ?
you' re talking to the fhrer here .
alright then .
and you , frulein braun , are you of aryan descent ?
then there' s nothing to stop us .
do you , mein fhrer , adolf hitler ... ... take eva braun , present here , as your wife ?
answer ' yes ' .
do you , eva braun , take fhrer adolf hitler , present here ... ... as your husband ?
answer ' yes ' .
then i declare you man and wife .
two men here .
everything will be alright .
you must go to the fhrer right away .
now ?
how long can we hold out ?
twenty hours , no more .
the russians are close .
at the moment , we forced them to stop .
you know , mohnke .
the western democracies are decadent .
they' il succumb to the people from the east .
all the best .
thank you .
it wasn' t just for germany .
a message from keitel .
1 .
wenck' s vanguard are stuck south of schwielowsee .
2 .
the 12th army can' t continue the attack on berlin .
3 .
the 9th army is completely surrounded .
what do we do when the last ammunition reserves have been exhausted ?
i' il never surrender .
never .
i forbid you , and the other commanders , to surrender .
listen , gnsche .
my wife and i are going to commit suicide .
i don' t want my corpse exposed by the russians .
i don' t want them to get me , dead or alive .
i want to be burnt and never to be found .
gnsche , i want you to promise me ... ... that you will do all that it takes .
mein fhrer ... ... this is a terrible order , but i will execute it .
kempka .
erich , i need 200 litres of petrol .
are you mad ?
where should i find them ?
from the parked vehicles .
what' s all that petrol for ?
i can' t say .
come , please .
the fhrer wants to see us .
should i tell the fhrer you' re indisposed ?
it' s only my collapsed lung .
i' il die soon anyway .
excuse me .
over here , herr professor .
one moment , please .
excuse me .
i' m sorry to interrupt your important work .
mein fhrer , keep faith in the final victory .
lead us and we shall follow .
come along .
join the gang .
come .
have a drink .
besides drinking , there' s little we can do .
do sit down .
that' s better .
yes , the situation is pretty shitty .
can we sit down ?
please do , frulein ...
frau ...
that' s frau hitler .
it' s alright .
a pity we can' t go outside anymore .
only if you want to die a heroic death .
fritz , control yourself a bit .
yes .
control .
take cover .
what are you doing here ?
i have to report to the fhrer .
you can' t right now .
sit down .
sit .
drink .
let me introduce frau hitler .
so young and so many decorations .
you must be proud .
excuse me .
i' m not used to drinking anymore .
you can use our toilet .
if your hand shakes , the bullet might only hit an optic nerve .
that' s why it' s good to also take the poison .
when you bite through the capsule , pull the trigger .
will i have enough time ?
the poison starts working after one or two seconds .
tornow , you too .
come blondi .
you know , frau junge , i' ve known ... my husband for more than 15 years .
but when i think about it , i know nothing about him .
even though he likes to talk .
i longed for berlin , but he' s so different now .
he only talks about dogs and vegetarian food now .
i hate blondi .
i sometimes kick her and adolf then wonders why she acts strange .
i think he doesn' t want anybody to really know him .
... he can be so caring in his private life .
and then he uses that rude language again .
when he' s the fhrer , you mean ?
come , let' s smoke another one .
i' m sorry .
you have so many worries and here i am , whining .
frau junge , i' m giving you this coat as a goodbye present .
i like fashionable ladies .
i want you to enjoy it .
what a surprise .
thank you .
i just don' t know where and when i can wear it .
please , try to get out of here .
promise me .
thank you .
that was very good , frulein manziarly .
the time has come .
it' s finished .
the fhrer wants to say goodbye .
come with me .
you' re the bravest mother of the reich .
fhrer , you made me the happiest woman in germany .
salute my beautiful bavaria .
children , what are you doing here ?
we want to see aunt eva and uncle hitler .
have you eaten anything yet ?
only breakfast .
stay here , i' il get something to eat .
i' il be right back .
comrades , this is the latest news from the outside .
there were houses here , there were houses there .
herr gnsche , i want to speak to the fhrer .
please , i have to .
frau goebbels , the fhrer doesn' t want to be disturbed .
please , gnsche , just for a moment .
please .
mein fhrer , frau goebbels is here .
what is it ?
leave berlin .
don' t leave us fhrer .
what will become of us ?
tomorrow , i' il be cursed by millions , but that' s how it is .
get up .
come .
come .
aunt traudl , i like it when it thunders .
why ?
nothing can happen to us here .
can it ?
no .
gotcha .
reichsleiter , it' s over .
the fhrer is dead .
there' s daddy .
are you crazy ?
for that damned petrol of yours ...
erich , shut up .
stand back .
come on , continue .
continue .
no , don' t .
let grandpa go .
order .
order .
we must have order .
order has to return .
this way .
we know the way .
you can trust us .
hurry .
i was on the side of the red beasts .
i supported the bolsheviks .
let' s hope the russians got our message .
we' il soon find out .
or not .
what news do you have , general ?
adolf hitler and his wife committed suicide in the bunker .
the new government authorised me ... ... to start peace talks ... ... between our countries , that both suffered severe losses .
general , if you were me , would you make peace with you ?
my government will never accept unconditional surrender .
given the situation , you have no other choice .
surrender ?
never .
that' s shameful .
years ago , i conquered berlin on the reds ... ... and i' il defend the city to my dying day .
in the short time i have as chancellor ... ... i' il never sign a surrender treaty .
it' s for the sake of the people .
the fhrer' s orders are final .
this is crazy .
we have to start negotiations .
i do not surrender .
send a message to marshal zhukov .
zhukov ?
what' s happening ?
we' re surrendering .
then i must kill you .
the fhrer forbids any surrender .
how long does it work ?
around four hours .
children , the doctor has the medication i told you about .
it' s a bit bitter , but it will work .
a sip for everybody .
who wants to go first ?
heide , you' re always so brave ?
have another sip .
see ?
that wasn' t so bad .
well done .
helmut .
this medication makes sure you don' t get ill in this humid bunker .
but it' s not humid in the bunker .
well done .
helga .
i don' t want to .
what' s that ?
do you want to get sick ?
please , mama .
i don' t want to drink it .
don' t cry , baby .
that doesn' t help .
you have to drink the medicine .
helga .
come on , open your mouth .
goodnight , children .
one day the lie will fall apart ... ... and there will be light in the darkness .
please read that .
one day the lie will fall apart and there will be light in the darkness .
let' s do it differently .
one day the lie will collapse ... ... and truth will triumph once again .
at that moment , we will stand above everybody ... ... pure and ... immaculate .
we don' t stand a chance .
so what ?
i want to get away .
how do we get through the lines ?
doesn' t matter .
i' m not staying another minute .
we' il die .
it won' t be that bad , surely .
if we stay , the russians will get us for sure .
all the best .
come , let' s go .
on 30 april 1945 , the fhrer committed suicide ... ... and in doing so , he deserted everybody who was loyal to him .
you , german soldiers , were loyal to the fhrer and were prepared ... ... to continue the battle for berlin , although ammunition was in short supply ... ... and further resistance was pointless .
i hereby declare an immediate cease fire .
each hour you continue fighting ... ... prolongs the suffering of the people of berlin and of our wounded .
in agreement with the supreme command of the soviet troops ... ... i order you to stop fighting immediately .
weidling , former commander of the berlin defence area .
a glass of water , please .
i don' t need you anymore .
the game' s over .
it' s time .
don' t you see what' s going on here ?
i insist that you help us , as a doctor .
alright , then .
go .
you did a lot .
thank you .
schdle , hurry .
come on .
i' m not going anywhere anymore .
come along .
are you alright ?
keep going .
sturmmann krger and his group defended the wolf bridge ... ... and he receives the iron cross .
sturmmann wagner took out two machine gun nests ... ... and therefore , receives the iron cross .
sturmmann rauch has gotten messages through the lines ... ... and receives the iron cross .
the others are coming .
take cover , miler .
who' s that ?
a german .
herr hewel ?
thank god , you' re alive .
where are the others ?
i don' t know , frau junge .
somewhere .
maybe .
most people from my group must be dead .
i should never have left that bunker .
i should have shot myself , but i couldn' t .
eat something first .
there' s always enough time to die .
you stay with the women .
come along .
the russians have surrounded us .
what' s going to happen to us ?
maybe you can get through .
you could try .
i' m not taking another step .
think about it .
the russians are after us .
as a woman , you might have a chance .
try it .
good luck .
when you walk past the russians , don' t look them in the eyes .
remember that well .
all the best .
the russians .
gerda , let' s go .
you go .
i' m exhausted .
please .
i have to give it a try .
don' t be angry with me .
i' il be alright .
herr doktor .
my comrades want to surrender .
can i join you ?
the fhrer' s dead .
do you want to continue the war on your own ?
i' m obliged by my oath .
then you' d better go to the brigadefhrer .
the russians are evacuating the square .
so ?
no opposition .
no shooting .
then they' il be here within the hour .
what shall we do ?
we can' t surrender .
what exactly do you mean ?
when the russians come , we' il empty our weapons on them .
the last bullets are for ourselves .
that' s radical .
is this prestigious murder and suicide our only option ?
we' re ss officers .
we can' t survive the fhrer .
who agrees with me ?
come and sit down with me ?
please .
why do you want to continue living ?
and you ?
why do you want to die ?
see this ?
the fhrer gave it to me personally .
as a last decoration ?
maybe .
a goodbye present from hitler .
i had to promise him something .
if the russians get me , i have to kill myself .
did he make you promise that ?
but why ?
maybe he didn' t want me to be forced ... ... to say anything bad about him .
but , as a diplomat , you' re under international protection .
who will benefit if you stick to your deal ?
there they are .
don' t shoot , comrades .
we surrendered .

i reassured myself by thinking i wasn' t personally guilty of it .

but one day , i walked past a commemorative plaque ... ... for sophie scholl , here in the franz joseph strasse .
i saw that she was my age ... ... and that she was executed in the year i joined hitler .
and only then did i realise ... that youth is no excuse .
and that it might have been possible to find out the truth .
downfall
