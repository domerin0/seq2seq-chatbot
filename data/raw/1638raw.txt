lyekka ?
kai ?
kai , kai , i can' t find lyekka anywhere and i , er
look , i think we' re being attacked .
by whom ?
well , i don' t know , does it matter ?
look kai i hate to break the news to you , but you' re not a plant !
you' re a brunnen g warrior , and then you became an assassin for the divine order , you' re not meant to rot in a garden !
so get up out of there and kill !
may i help you ?
what' s happening ?
we are being attacked .
i know that , but by who ?
balloons .
from fire ?
likely .
lyekka !
stan .
no .
i just wanted to make you happy stan .
you have you do !
listen , lyekka , are you ok ?
i didn' t see them coming .
stan ?
yes ?
i have to say goodbye now .
no no no no no , we have to take you back to the lexx and we can fix you up .
you make me happy .
i' il always be in your heart .
if you cry , you' il lose the memory of our love .
no .
she is dead .
no !
yes .
and stanley , you are in danger .
i can protect you , but i cannot protect you and the moth and xev at the same time unless you stay together .
yeah .
i guess you' re right .
where' s xev ?
xev !
they' ve got the moth !
xev !
xev !
can you reach it ?
yes , i can .
kai ?
yes ?
i' m coming with you .
hang on .
xev ?
kai , you fly , i' il help xev .
xev , is that you ?
it is xev .
xev , xev ?
i don' t get it .
let' s go .
where ?
out .
a moth , it doth go boom .
a moth , it doth descend .
kai and stanley assumed that you would be in the moth , exactly as i had anticipated .
it was an excellent plan .
clever .
brilliant .
insightful .
genius .
stupid !
stupid ?
do you doubt me , xev ?
kai can' t be killed , he' s already dead .
but stanley can .
and kai does not float .
correct ?
my prince thinks of everything .
so , we have you , and stanley and your dead man are out of the picture , isn' t that excellent ?
wonderful .
satisfying .
exciting .
inevitable .
evil .
i won' t disagree with that .
that' s what we do .
we' re bad .
it' s our job .
our lives .
our commitment .
we' re the opposite of good .
anything but .
you see xev , that' s what fire is all about .
it' s the repository of all that is not good .
precisely .
don' t you have a mind of your own ?
oooo ...
no .
am i beautiful ?
the most .
witty ?
the sharpest .
do you love me ?
completely .
would you die for me ?
in an instant .
i think i' m going to be sick .
you see xev , priest lives on fire and i am its ruler .
and he knows that the least hint of disobedience would mean an immediate return to terrible pain and suffering , and as you know
i' m very good with pain .
however , as he is my priest , he does not suffer much for now , at least .
my prince we have a problem .
the sky' s full of balloons .
they' re everywhere .
they' re all around us .
and one of them likely contains xev .
xev !
can you hear us ?
kai !
that was xev , did you hear that ?
xev !
we can hear you !
xev , where are you ?
now the game will become more interesting .
a challenge .
a test .
a contest .
a battle .
which you will lose .
a defeat .
a defeat ?
for them .
victory for us .
precisely .
you see xev
flying a balloon
flying a balloon is not a science .
it' s not an art .
there' s a lot of luck involved .
sometimes you get an updraft
sometimes you don' t
you never know .
but if you have a lot of balloons
as we do .
then you' re more likely to get a favourable wind than if you have only one .
it' s a simple matter of mathematics .
in order to destroy their balloon , our balloons must rise higher .
or at least one of them must .
what ?
rise above all the others .
we need to shed some weight .
her ?
no .
thank you !
we need you more than we need them .
you could be useful .
we gotta make it to another one of those cities .
don' t you want to rescue xev ?
well , yeah kai , but we gotta get some help first .
i have observed that the residents of the various cities on water suffer from
or perhaps , benefit from a certain complacency in relation to the potential dangers they face .
yeah .
they seem to live for the minute , in a kind of continuum , and will likely show no interest in our problem .
ok , what do you suggest then ?
engage the other balloons in battle , to save xev now on our own .
but what but they' re all around us , how can we attack them all ?
we will not have to attack them .
they appear to be organising themselves to attack us .
oh , come on , there' s way too many .
they' re gonna beat us .
likely you are correct .
ok , i' m correct .
what are we gonna do ?
whatever we can .
you know kai , that' s easy for you to say because you' re an assassin .
you see , i' m a security guard class 4 , formerly an assistant deputy backup courier .
you know , doing battle' s not part of my nature .
you are captain of the lexx , the mightiest weapon in the two universes what' s left of them and have been so for more than four thousand years .
they seek advantage by rising above us , so they are shedding weight to gain in altitude .
i' m pumping this thing as hard as i can .
did they hit us ?
not where it matters .
they are not trying to hit the gondola .
their strategy is to puncture our balloon' s bag and make us descend .
make sure they all stay out of range of his weapon .
excellent plan .
would you care for a drink ?
very well .
i won' t bother to offer you one again .
they' re rising above us .
correct .
well what can we do ?
we can wait .
wait for what ?
for them to make a mistake .
that' s our entire plan ?
yes .
yeah , well what if they don' t make a mistake ?
then they will succeed and we will fail .
what does that mean ?
it means , that you will die
and i will sink to the centre of this planet .
why is it that i do all the pumping and you do all the standing around ?
i will pump if you request , but then i will not be able to stop darts .
oh , that' s ok , i like to pump .
did they get the balloon ?
not yet .
close .
you seem so far away from me now and we used to be so close .
we were never close .
i remember your kisses well .
they were warm and close .
i was vulnerable , and you took advantage of me .
there was nothing real .
i see hate in your eyes .
you should be one of mine , you should be with me .
if you can hate me , you should be able to hate others .
it' s a small step for you to take .
take it xev .
be mine .
no .
why do you do this ?
i tempt those who can be tempted , and i punish those who deserve to be punished .
that is my function , my occupation , my job my joy .
what is wrong with that ?
and i also punish some who have done nothing wrong , who slip through the cracks but then , no system is perfect .
you may not understand why i do what i do , but even less do i understand why you make the choices that you do .
i can see into you , xev .
i can see things inside you that even you do not consciously remember .
you have every reason to hate .
good baby .
good baby .
good baby .
good baby .
good baby xev of b3k .
good food .
good food .
good food baby xev of b3k .
do you remember that ?
your childhood , xev of b3k ?
no .
but you were raised in a box .
i was raised in the wife bank on b3k , yes .
but i really don' t remember much of it .
there was not much about it to remember .
we' ve been hit .
we' re losing altitude .
we have punctured their balloon bag .
they are going down .
soon they will be in the water and we can shoot at them at will .
we do not want that .
so what do we do ?
we wait .
good morning matron .
good morning , xev of b3k .
lesson 376 .
your husband asks you " do you think i' m fat ?
what is the correct answer ?
1 .
no !
2 .
it' s not what you look like on the outside , but the man on the inside that matters to me .
3 .
i like a man with a lot of meat on his bones !
can we get naked now and play ridethe tower of power ?
it' s not what you look like on the outside , but the man on the inside that matters to me ?
wrong !
the correct answer is i like a man with a lot of meat on his bones !
can we get naked now and play ride the tower of power ?
xev of b3k always flatter your man .
never admit his failings .
use any occasion to please him in bed .
xev of b3k at this rate you will not graduate from the wife bank for 5 . 9 years .
i' il try to do better in future , matron .
do you remember that ?
it' s all a blur .
hard to remember exactly but also hard to forget .
so much pain .
so ?
no .
should we fire everything at them now ?
firing everything at them will have no effect on the dead man .
it is now time to change our strategy .
the right thing to do .
you should have come over to me xev .
never .
i once gave you the chance to let stanley tweedle destroy this planet , but you refused my chance because you are a good person
which means you are my enemy , which means you have to die .
throw her over the side .
with pleasure .
but , we will attach a piece of string to her , to improve our negotiating position .
what was that ?
xev .
the time has come for you to make a deal !
he wants to make a deal , what now ?
we wait for him to make a mistake .
well , he hasn' t been making too many so far .
listen kai , why don' t you just , you know , do the assassination thing with your brace and get this over with ?
i would , if my brace were fully functional , but it is not .
what , what' s the deal ?
the dead man will jump over the side and sink into the sea .
unless he does that in ten seconds , priest will cut the cord on xev , and she will sink into the sea .
10 .
no .
9 .
8 .
7 ..
no !
don' t do it , kai !
6 .
5 .
4 ..
no kai , don' t do it .
you' re our only hope .
3 .
2 .
1 ..
look !
he' s climbing over the side for you .
isn' t it sweet ? !
no , kai !
no , kai !
why did you do that ?
the ten seconds were up , so i cut the cord like you said .
i did not tell you to cut it .
i am deeply sorry , my prince .
it will not happen again but i don' t know what i did wrong .
you made a mistake .
look .
kai !
bring me down to xev .
there is a faint possibility that your stupidity will lead to my opportunity .
we certainly have the advantage of height now .
thank you .
you' re welcome .
oh , it' s nice to see you xev .
why don' t we just crash , down in the water ?
in that case , i would be fine , but you and xev would become very easy targets .
kai .
kai , i hate to interrupt your meditation , but things are not looking very good for us here .
release the stays .
release the stays ?
yes , we must release the stays which suspend the gondola from the balloon now .
fire everything .
we must kill them now , before they get any higher .
how can they get any higher ?
fire everything !
we have to kill them now !
good move , kai .
look .
shall i release the mainstay ?
yes .
the balloon' s losing air .
how can we make it to the lexx ?
we will have to be very lucky .
we' re already slowing down .
soon we will start to drop , rapidly .
we must shed weight .
what weight ?
oh no no .
look !
are you ready ?
nearly .
we' re losing time .
what are you doing ?
i have to release the mainstay from up here or else i will go down with the gondola .
you' re going down with the gondola .
i' m sorry , i' m not clear
i have no further use for you .
you' re dead weight .
now please fall to your death with the gondola , and don' t waste anymore time about it .
is that clear enough for you ?
very clear .
you are my prince .
your mistake provided my opportunity .
their balloon is losing air , ours is not .
it will be easy to rise above them and pick them off .
you are my prince .
now get on with it .
i will get on with it !
you , you fool !
what do you think you will gain ?
what else would you expect ?
now i will rise to the top .
no .
and i will rule this planet !
you will suffer !
we' re not gonna make it , are we ?
no .
our balloon is losing too much air .
well what , what now ?
look , there .
oh no .
no no no no no no .
you' re not actually suggesting that i let go and throw myself down there , and if i' m incredibly lucky land on prince' s balloon , are ya ?
no .
no .
well that' s good because , you know , i wouldn' t die after i missed the balloon and hit the water , because my heart' d stop long before that .
we have to jump stan .
no xev .
i' m informing you right now that i am in no way equipped for a jump like that .
you know , my fingers won' t respond to the instructions from my brain to let go .
my brain wouldn' t even produce an instruction like that .
i will jump , and then i will bring you over .
well how ?
no no no no .
your brace isn' t working right , remember ?
hopefully , you will still be close enough .
i think i must pick up stan first , then i will grab you .
ah !
i' m not ready for this xev .
you go .
captains first .
my heart' s still working .
i don' t believe it .
xev' s balloon is outta control .
fire your brace kai , fire now !
she is out of range .
well we have to go down and get her .
we will , but in a moth .
a moth ?
we don' t have time .
the other balloons' il get to her first .
we are now in the divide between the atmospheres of the two planets .
xev will land on fire .
we can reach her in a moth , before the other balloons .
all night by the kai , kai .
all night by his corpse i did moan .
i dreamed he was tweaking my circuits .
while i was tweaking his bone .
do these mothbreeders ever stop ?
no .
all night without kai , kai .
i' m lonely , i' m blue , and i' m sick .
i dream of his frozen kisses .
and fondling his frozen
kai !
you' ve come back to me !
come here , oh dark dead and delicious one .
kai !
kai , i' m here .
come back .
come back !
come back .
you' il come back .
you need me .
you' re just in an awfully big hurry .
that' s all .
i understand .
it' s ok .
no , really , it' s ok .
it' s not ok !
it' s not ok !
i love you kai !!!
what are you doing here ?
i must build more moths .
are you one of the mothbreeders who were taken to duketown ?
i must build more moths .
i know this probably doesn' t mean anything to you
but like me , you were a prisoner on the cluster , and they turned you into what you are now .
but you were once a real person .
a real person who lived a real life .
can you understand that , even a little ?
you were a real person !
i must build more moths .
poor you .
poor me .
you again .
me again .
how did you get here ?
i died .
you don' t look dead .
i' m not .
i died , and now i have been reawakened here , for you .
why ?
i want to be with you when you die .
i' ve never seen anyone die for the first time .
what makes you think that i' m going to die ?
you' re on the surface of the planet fire , the sun' s up you cannot last the hour .
and you ?
oh , i will also die .
how sad .
not for me i' m used to it .
and it will not be so bad for you , although your friends will miss you .
do you know what a cluster lizard is ?
not really .
a cluster lizard is a very nasty animal , that i think originally came from a very hot place .
how does that matter ?
you will see .
when ?
in less than an hour .
we' il never find her .
we will search for the balloon .
how are you going ?
fine , thank you .
i' m not .
i' m hot , i have to stop .
why aren' t you dying ?
i' m very good with heat .
ironically , i' m not .
how is it that you' re not dying ?
i' m not all human .
can you still find whatever memory you want with your hand , like you did before ?
yes .
think cluster lizard .
then i guess you get to see me die .
do you still feel anything for me ?
a little .
you shouldn' t .
i agree .
well i didn' t admit it before , but i' m hot , too .
really hot .
hey , look , look , do you see it ?
yes .
she' s not in it .
she may be somewhere upwind .
i hope .
the dead do not hope .
yeah , well kai the living certainly do .
