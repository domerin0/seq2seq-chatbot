go , go , go , go !
move it , move it !
move it !
let' s go !
move , move !
in the car !
let' s go .
let' s go !
there' s 4 of you .
you can count .
i' m impressed .
now drive .
rule one ...
never change the deal .
the deal was transportation ... for 3 men with a combined weight ... of 254 kilos .
yeah ?
well , this is a new deal .
an extra 80 kilos means we' il not make ... your destination on the gas i have allotted .
so we' il stop and get more gas !
every stop we make exposes us .
every exposure ... increases the risk of getting caught .
an extra 80 kilos means the koni shock absorbers ...
i installed for this job will not give us ... the ability to outmaneuver ... any police that might be chasing us .
which means , if there is a chase ... we lose our advantage , which also increases ... the possibility of getting caught .
i don' t want to get caught .
you don' t want to get caught .
just drive the car , man ... or you' re gonna catch a bullet through the brains !
and who' s going to drive ?
shoot this asshole !
i' il drive .
not without the ignition code you won' t .
3 men .
254 kilos .
that was the deal .
argh !
3 men , 254 kilos .
seat belts .
argh !
shit !
shit !
see what i mean about the shocks ?
now it' s time .
move it , marcel , move it !
look out !
get out of the road !
one way , one way !
we' re going the wrong way !
stop it , marcel , stop !
move away !
look out , look out !
whoa !
whoo hoo !
yes !
go , go , go !
merde . !
oh ... shit !
if you don' t mind ...
i just conditioned the leather back there .
take us to the drop point !
not yet .
aah !
hello .
the cops , the cops !
what are you doing ?
don' t stop now !
do something !
come on , do something !
what are you thinking ?
your gun , please .
police !
stop !
stop !
police !
i' m fed up with this car chase !
you gave me too much .
we need you to take us to avignon .
the deal was this far and no further .
the deal is the deal .
rule number one .
rules are meant to be broken .
not mine .
let' s go .
get in the car .
come on !
quick !
move it !
really i did .
oh , yeah , well , how come ... you don' t have your yellow card with you ?
well , i ...
i ... must' ve left it back in nam on the base .
yeah , they all say that .
left it back in nam on the base . " uh huh .
let me show you what we do to people ... who left it back in nam on the base .
oh , no !
please let go of me !
where are you taking me ?
you gotta be punished for not carrying ... your shot record on you .
it' s a fate far worse than death .
the argentinian government reaffirmed ... its commitment to meeting ... the i. m. f' s target this year .
and yesterday , in nice ... 4 men robbed the alliance investment corporation .
one man died on the sidewalk .
the others were apprehended early this morning ... when they took a wrong turn on a one way street ... in avignon and ran into a taxi cab .
the police said ... were it not for their poor driving habits ... the 20 million euros in bearer bonds ... would have been cashed and gone by this afternoon .
and in other news ...
i always say the way a man treats his car ... is how he treats himself .
i' d say that' s probably true , inspector .
heh heh heh !
you have a good sense of humor ... for a foreigner , monsieur frank .
like the french .
sly wit .
just the right amount of flavor .
been out driving ?
until they pass a law that says i can' t .
you want to come in for a coffee ?
uh , thank you ... but i have a lot of stops to make .
88 to be exact .
that' s a lot of stops .
a lot of 1999 black bmw 765s ... with 06 in the license plates to check out .
oh , it' s a very popular car ... with a certain type down here .
you' ve seen them .
they come over from italy ... in those very expensive suits ... and the young pretty girls ... with the big jewelry and too much make up .
very ...
mafia .
there was a robbery .
a getaway .
some very fancy driving .
by someone in a 1999 black bmw 735 ?
with 06 on the plate .
you have been in the city lately ?
not for a while .
i love nice .
the food ... the way they grill fish .
no place else in france does it ... the way they do in nice .
and the women ...
i prefer the women there .
they are more ... complicated ... than the local variety .
don' t you think ?
i don' t particularly like complicated .
you like to keep it simple .
why are you so interested ?
oh , you know , uh ... ever since i' m a little boy ... military people have always intrigued me .
i' m ex military .
i' m an ex little boy .
sure you don' t have time for a coffee ?
everything is always ... so neat with you , monsieur frank .
nothing ever out of place .
i' il take that as a compliment ... coming from a man who pays attention to every detail .
maybe i' il come back later for that coffee .

yeah .
let' s keep it that way .
i picked them from the garden outside .
i hope you don' t mind .

i hope you like , uh ...
ma de leine .
try one .
careful .
it' s hot .
good ?
let me .
i like it quiet in the morning .
yes .
quiet in the morning .
me , too .
me , too .
i' m the same way .
i like very quiet .
sorry .
are you looking for milk ?
there' s milk at the door .
stay , stay .
i' il go .
hi .
and you are ?
the new cook .
is monsieur frank in ?
ah !
monsieur frank .
is your invitation for coffee still open ?
sure , come on .
please , sit .
madeleine ?
homemade ?
yes .
i' il bring some more .
ah .
my mother used to make ... fresh madeleines every morning .
i smell them and my whole childhood ... comes back in one big flood ...
like proust .
you ever read proust , monsieur frank ?
no .
ah .
he' s fantastic .
memory like a steel trap .
he would have been a great cop .
a real detail man .
milk ?
please .
mmm .
thank you .
ahh .
i used to have a memory like proust .
like a filing cabinet up there .
i would see something and remember it like that .
like , uh , license plates .
i could see a plate and it was printed in my head .
now i need all the help i can get ... remembering whose plate ... goes with whose car .
like , uh , this one .
it' s mine .
ah , memories .
so ?
where' s the rest of the car ?
i was hoping you could tell me .
it was stolen .
stolen ?
yeah , i went down to frejus to pick up a few things .
when i came out of the market , it was ...
gone .
did you report it ?
it' s the first on my list of things to do today .
it' s a long walk from frejus .
how did you get home ?
well ...
i brought him .
i saw him walking along the dark road .
mm , a risky thing .
picking up a stranger on a dark road .
he had a kind face .
i didn' t see a car outside .
it' s in the garage .
may i see it ?
mm hmm .
wow .
pretty nice car for a cook .
some people have a problem with the germans .
they' re too aggressive .
they take up the best beaches in summer .
they can' t cook worth a damn .
i say anyone who makes such great cars ... can' t be all bad .
i would say your intuition worked out very well ... for monsieur frank , mademoiselle .
worked out for both of us .
bon .
my intuition says this is probably a good time ... for me to go file my report .
where' s the rest of my car ?
oh , yes .
i almost forgot .
it was blown to pieces at a rest stop .
what' s left of it is down at the lab .
they' re trying to separate what was left ... of the 2 cops in the trunk ... from the rest of it .
but , uh , you wouldn' t know anything about that ?
no .
sorry to interrupt .
thank you for the coffee and the memories .
come back any time .
would you mind walking me ?
come on .
you have always been very quiet ... about your business , monsieur frank .
i appreciate that .
less work for mother .
but this business at the rest stop .
that is not very quiet .
i don' t suppose you would like to tell me ... something besides a stolen car story ?
if i had one i would .
well , may i suggest that when the 2 of you ... show up in my office after lunch ... you do have one .
a better one than you currently have .
you are the one he wants to see ... not me !
quiet !
please , i have to think .
you were supposed to think last night .
yeah , well , last night i had nightmares ... about a girl who came into my nice , quiet life ... screwed it all up .
everything she touched broke ... and every move she made turned into a catastrophe .
ok .
sorry .
i' m still wondering if i want to know everything ... or nothing about you .
what ?
the quiet .
i thought you liked quiet .
yeah , not this quiet .
aah !
you ok ?
no !
good .
let' s go .
uhh !
aah !
go !
go !
go !
uhh !
aah !
aah !
no , don' t stay there !
no !
aah !
aah !
aah !
frank !
come on , give me your hand !
aah !
uhh !
aah !
aah !
come on !
come on , get in !
get in !
no !
no !
get in !
lai , look !
come on , you wanna die ? !
get in !
calm down , ok ?
don' t worry .
you ok ?
stay here .
i' m coming back .
no , wait !
wait !
uhh !
aah !
put it on .
you ok ?
mm .
sure ?
ok , let' s go .
frank ?
is this your house ?
frank ?
uhh !
yeah , guess .
frank .
i should mind my own goddamn business .
a simple rule .
a simple , little rule .
there' s gotta be some dry clothes ... in this house .
don' t open the package .
nothing but trouble , you open the goddamn package .
frank .
what are you doing ?
making up for the trouble .
wait , wait .
why are you making ...
no more questions .
wait .
i don' t like it when things get complicated .
you like things simple .
very simple .
i' m not so clear about the house .
could you explain ... uh , one more time .
after i left .
after you left , we went for a walk on the beach .
had a swim .
where again ?
past the point .
anyone else swimming at that time ?
no .
did you see anybody else swimming ?
no .
no one .
so , you took a walk , had a swim ... on a beach where no one else was swimming ... past the point where you can' t see ... or be seen from the beach on either side ... which makes witnesses a little hard to come by .
that' s the point of a romantic swim .
who wants witnesses ?
and then ?
then we came back to the house ... found it on fire .
just like that ?
on fire ?
yes .
and the 5, 000 rounds of spent ammo ... my men found all around the house ?
maybe they had the wrong house .
monsieur frank ... people with this kind of firepower ... do not make mistakes about who they visit .
who would want you this dead ?
i don' t know .
any problems with a client ?
i don' t have clients .
i' m retired .
i live on my army pension , you know that .
you have all the facts of who i am ... and who i was .
you' ve had them for years .
any enemies you can think of ?
people from the past ?
i left the past behind when i moved here .
huh .
a past like yours you never leave behind .
commissaire , on vous demande en bas .
i' il just be a moment .
don' t leave .
what are you doing ?
computers know everything .
you just need a password .
what , are you nuts ?
we' re in a police station .
you' re always complaining .
except when we make love .
then you say nothing .
aha .
ah .
# la la la #
hello .
see ?
so , where will you be staying ?
i don' t know .
well , my cousin has a small hotel .
thanks , but we' il manage .
without money , it would be hard .
here .
it' s not much ... but at least you won' t go hungry .
thank you .
where are you going ?
going to see that guy .
good luck .
one minute .
you' re not coming ?
no .
but he blew up your car .
i' il buy a new one .
he burned your house .
i' il rebuild it .
he tried to kill you !
and as far as he knows , he succeeded .
look , i' m going to give you some advice .
i don' t know what you were into .
i don' t care what you were into .
but whoever wanted you dead ... thinks you' re dead .
you have a free pass to start over .
start over !
there are 400 people dying ... in a container on a ship .
my father .
my sisters .
the ship arrives today .
they will make my father a slave .
the only one who knows the container number ... is that guy .
you' re very good .
what do you mean ?
the moment you saw those pictures in my house ... you were setting me up to get involved in this .
the breakfast .
giving the excuse to the cop to help me .
one lie after another .
not everything is a lie .
name one thing that isn' t ?
what happened in the house ... between us ... that was not a lie .
you were a soldier .
your job was to save people .
past tense .
what does that mean ?
it means i got tired of seeing my best efforts ... get turned into bullshit by the same people ... who paid me to do the job .
no one cared .
this time ...
i care .
thank you .
bonjour .
bonjour .
no phone calls for half an hour ?
hello .
surprise !
sit .
put your hands where i can see ' em .
so , before we get to the heart of the matter ...
i have one question for you .
why' d you try to kill me ?
you lied to me .
you opened the package .
you broke the rules .
your rules .
what did you expect me to do ... recommend you for another job ?
what' s the ship number ?
mr. transporter ... we can both agree ...
i answered your first question politely .
i won' t answer any more ... so i suggest you kill me right now ... and go screw yourself .
i can' t find anything .
oh , poor frank .
what did she tell you ?
we' re smuggling people in containers ?
i tell you , " lai " ' s the perfect name for her .
mr. kwai' s on the way up .
your father' s here .
he' il really get a kick out of this .
i thought your father was in a container .
yes !
i ...
i mean , no .
there are 400 people in that container .
stay where you are !
she' s a real heartbreaker , isn' t she , frank ?
10 seconds , 2 choices .
the information on the paper or your brains on the desk !
now tell me i' m lying !
9 ... 8 ...
lai .
lai , give me the gun .
i don' t know what you' re talking about . ... 6 ... 5 ... 4 ... 3 ... 2 ... ... one .
shoot .
lai !
would i kill my own daughter ?
lai .
come on now .
put it down .
we' il talk .
she thinks we' re smuggling people in containers .
i don' t know where you get these ideas !
stay away !
would you kill your own father ?
please ...
i am begging you .
stop what you are doing .
i do what i do .
i am who i am .
i' il never change .
so if you' re going to kill me ... kill me .
but if you don' t ... get this gun out of my face !
give me .
no !
i know he' s innocent .
oh , you have such a good heart .
always interested in saving innocent people .
well , here' s your big chance .
drop your gun ... and you will save one .
kill him !
no !
the police are on their way up .
what now ?
take her .
send in leo .
i need him to wrap something up .
just for the record ... there aren' t 400 people in that container .
only 395 made it here alive .
frank !
inspector .
am i glad you' re here .
what is this ?
what is this ?
this man used my partner' s daughter here ... to try and blackmail us .
luckily , my security got the drop on him .
i wanna press charges ... kidnapping ... extortion , assault .
i know this man .
well , i suppose in your business ... you have to know all types .
now , should i call my lawyer ?
we' il handle it .
i' il expect all of you ... down at my office to give your statements .
as soon as i contact my lawyer ... we' il be more than happy to oblige .
ohh .
mmm ...
the doctor said you will have a headache ... for a few days and then everything ... will go back to normal .
where are they ?
ah , i think you should be more concerned ... with where you are .
what got into you ?
you were always so careful .
i' ve got to get out of here .
oh , well , with the charges they filed ... you will not be getting out ... for a very long time .
assaulting a distinguished member ... of the international business community ... kidnapping his daughter ... extortion .
i' m sorry , frank .
i would like to help you ... but if you continue with the same old story ...
i am retired , living on a pension ...
i need fresh , frank .
i need new .
for once , i need the truth .
ok .
they' re smuggling people .
from asia through marseilles ... in containers .
you know this for fact ?
the girl told me .
you believe her ?
yes .
in french we have a saying ...
never believe the cook .
she' s not the cook .
oh .
i suspected .
you know , frank ... no one is perfect .
so you' re saying you' re gonna do nothing ?
no , i' m saying ...
i' m going to start an investigation .
and in the meantime , the 400 people ... in that container could be dead already .
but what am i supposed to do ?
there are laws .
did it ever occur to you that sometimes ... you have to make your own law ?
like you do ?
at least with me , it doesn' t take 12 months ... to get the job done .
oh , yes , i know .
that' s what i admire about you , frank .
all that army training ... all that sneaking around ... a man like you could probably resolve this case ... in , how long ?
12 hours ?
less .
less ?
impressive .
you would be the perfect man for the job .
yes ... if i were out .
yes ... if you were out .
anybody moves and i kill him .
personne ne bouge .
baissez vos armes .
ce type est dingue et capable de tout .

found her in a bag .
isn' t that where you left her ?
you know nothing .
move !
you got involved with the wrong girl ... you dumb shit .
the delivery will be made .
my daughter will get over it .
if i' m lucky , maybe she' il see the light .
yeah , if she' s lucky maybe you' il get hit by a truck .
what do you know ?
i know she' il never stop being who she is ... and she' il never be you or anything like you .
she' il come around ... but you won' t be here to see it .
no !
i guess she won' t be coming around after all .
turn around !
i' d rather see it coming .
makes no difference to me .
he was a bastard ... but he was still my father .
pretty impressive timing , frank .
i guess i underestimated you .

# just when i knew it #
# knew it , knew it #
# it was my time to sink or swim #
# you came along and pulled me out #
# of all the trouble i was in #
# why did you do it ? #
# do it , do it #
# why did you risk your life for mine ? #
# would i have done the same for you ? #
# would i have saved you just in time ? #
# you saved my heart #
# you don' t even know me #
# you saved my dream #
# you heard me scream #
# oh #
# you saved my soul #
# love that you have shown me #
# you saved my life #
# you saved my life # [ echoing ]
# where did you come from ? #
# how did you know i was alone ? #
# that i never stood a chance #
# to find a way out on my own ? #
# who sent the message #
# that i was hanging by a thread ? #
# by this very time tomorrow #
# they will leave me here for dead #
# why did you do it ? #
# why did you risk your life for mine ? #
# would i have done the same for you ? #
# would i have saved you just in time ? #
# you saved my heart #
# you don' t even know me #
# you saved my dream #
# you heard me scream #
# whoa #
# my lost soul #
# was saved by a stranger #
# who saved my life #
# you saved my life #
# saved my life #
# saved my life #
# saved my heart #
# saved my heart #
# and you don' t even know me #
# ooooh #
# saved my soul #
# saved my soul #
# saved my dream #
# saved my dream #
# saved my life #
# oooh #
# you saved my heart #
# you don' t even know me #
# you saved my dream #
# you heard me scream #
# whoa #
# my lost soul #
# was saved by a stranger #
# who saved my life #
# you saved my life #
# you saved my heart #
# you don' t even know me #
# you saved my dream #
# you heard me scream #
# whoa #
# my lost soul #
# was saved by a stranger #
# you saved my life #
# you saved my life # [ echoes ]
