choose life .
choose a job .
choose a career .
choose a family .
choose a fucking big television .
choose washing machines , cars ... compact disc players and electrical tin openers .
gangway !
run !
choose good health ...
iow cholesterol and dental insurance .
choose fixed interest mortgage payments .
choose a starter home .
choose your friends .
choose leisure wear and matching luggage .
choose a three piece suite on hire purchase in a range of fucking fabrics .
chose d. i. y. and wondering who the fuck you are on a sunday morning .
choose sitting on that couch watching mind numbing , spirit crushing game shows ... stuffing fucking junk food into your mouth .
jammy goal !
choose rotting away at the end of it all .
pissing your last in a miserable home ; nothing more than an embarrassment ... to the selfish , fucked up brats that you' ve spawned to replace yourself .
choose your future .
choose life .
here comes johnny yeah , yeah
but why would i want to do a thing like that ?
he' s gonna do another striptease
i chose not to choose life .
i chose something else .
and the reasons ?
there are no reasons .
who needs reasons when you' ve got heroin ?
yeah , a song called love
well , dance like you' re hypnotized chickens
goldfinger' s " better than " dr. no .
both of them are a lot better than " diamonds are forever .
a judgment reflected in its relatively poor showing at the box office .
and in which field , of course ...
thunderball " was a notable success .
people think it' s all about misery and desperation ... and death and all that shite , which is not to be ignored .
fuck off !
jealous cunt .
but what they forget is the pleasure of it .
they' re all dead , right , mate ?
you prick !
otherwise we wouldn' t do it .
do you want me to ?
yeah .
pure as the driven snow , that shit you done .
after all , we' re not fucking stupid .
at least we' re not that fucking stupid .
take the best orgasm you' ve ever had ... multiply it by a thousand , and you' re still nowhere near it .
it beats any meat injection .
that beats any fucking cock in the world .
when you' re on junk , you have only one worry : scoring .
and when you' re off it , you' re suddenly obliged to worry about all sorts of other shite .
got no money , can' t get drunk .
got money , drinkin ' too much .
can' t get a girl , no chance of a ride .
got a girl , too much hassle .
you have to worry about bills , about food ... about some football team that never fucking wins .
about human relationships and all the things that really don' t matter ... when you' ve got a sincere and truthful junk habit .
i' d say , in those days , he was a muscular actor .
with all the presence of someone like cooper or lancaster ... but combined with a sly wit ...
to make him a formidable romantic lead .
and closer , in that respect , to cary grant .
ahh .
hey , man , where' d you get that illusion [ continues ]
the only drawback , or at least the principal drawback ... is that you have to endure all manner of cunts telling you that
no way would i poison my body with that shite .
all them fucking chemicals .
no fucking way .
it' s a waste of your life , man ... poisoning your body with that shite .
every chance you' ve had , son , you' ve blown it .
stuffing your veins with that filth .
from time to time , even i have uttered the magic words .
never again , swanney .
i' m off the skag .
are you serious ?
yeah , no more .
i' m finished with that shite .
well , that' s up to you , man .
gonna do it right this time .
gonna get it sorted out , get off it for good .
i' m sure i' ve heard that one before .
the sick boy method .
oh , well , it really worked for him , eh ?
well , he' s always been lacking in moral fiber .
he knows a lot about sean connery .
that' s hardly a substitute .
you need one more hit ?
no , i don' t think so .
for the long night that lies ahead ?
we called him mother superior ... on account of the length of his habit .
of course , i' d have another shot .
after all , i had work to do .
relinquishing junk .
stage one : preparation .
for this , you will need one room which you will not leave .
soothing music .
tomato soup , ten tins of .
mushroom soup , eight tins of , for consumption cold .
ice cream , vanilla , one large tub of .
magnesia , milk of , one bottle .
paracetamol , mouthwash , vitamins .
mineral water , lucozade , pornography .
one mattress .
one bucket for urine ... one for feces and one for vomitus .
one television and one bottle of valium , which i' ve already procured from my mother ... who is , in her own domestic and socially acceptable way , also a drug addict .
now i' m ready .
all i need is one final hit to soothe the pain ... while the valium takes effect .
mikey ?
aye , yeah , it' s mark renton .
look , i wondered , could you help me out ?
this was typical of mikey forrester .
what the fuck are these ?
under the normal run of things ...
i would have nothing to do with the cunt , but this was not the normal run of things .
opium suppositories .
ideal for your purposes .
slow release , bring you down gradually .
custom fucking designed for your needs .
i want a fucking hit .
that' s all i' ve got , man .
take it or leave it .
are you feeling better now then , eh ?
oh , aye .
for all the good they' ve done , i might as well have stuck them up my arse .
heroin makes you constipated .
the heroin from my last hit is fading away ... and the suppositories have yet to melt .
i' m no longer constipated .
i fantasize about a massive pristine convenience .
brilliant gold taps , virginal white marble , a seat carved from ebony ... a cistern full of chanel no .
5 and a flunky ... handing me pieces of raw silk toilet roll .
but under the circumstances , i' il settle for anywhere .
oh , fuck .
oh , my [ farts , sighs ]
yes , a fucking dancer !
and now , now i' m ready .
the downside of coming off junk was i knew ...
i would need to mix with my friends again ... in a state of full consciousness .
it was awful .
they reminded me so much of myself i could hardly bear to look at them .
take sick boy , for instance .
he came off junk at the same time as me .
not because he wanted to , you understand , but just to annoy me .
just to show me how easily he could do it .
thereby , downgrading my own struggle .
sneaky fucker , don' t you think ?
and when all i wanted to do was lie there and feel sorry for myself ... he insisted on telling me once again about his unifying theory of life .
it' s certainly a phenomenon in all walks of life .
what do you mean ?
well , at one point , you' ve got it , then you lose it .
and it' s gone forever .
all walks of life .
georgie best , for example , had it , lost it .
or david bowie or lou reed .
lou reed .
some of his solo stuff' s not bad .
no , it' s not bad , but it' s not great either , is it ?
and in your heart you kind of know that although it sounds all right ... it' s actually just shite .
so , who else ?
charlie nicholas , david niven , malcolm mclaren , elvis presley  okay , okay , okay .
so what is the point you' re trying to make ?
all i am trying to do , mark ... is to help you understand that " the name of the rose " is merely a blip ... on an otherwise uninterrupted downward trajectory .
what about " the untouchables " ?
i don' t rate that at all .
despite the academy award ?
that means fuck all .
it' s a sympathy vote .
so , we all get old .
we can' t hack it anymore and that' s it ?
yeah .
that' s your theory ?
yeah .
beautifully fucking illustrated .
give me the gun .
give me the gun .
do you see the beast ?
have you got it in your sights ?
clear enough , miss moneypenny .
this should present no significant problems .
fucking hell !
get away  [ growling ]
for a vegetarian , rents , you' re a fuckin ' evil shot .
no !
get off !
without heroin ...
i attempted to lead a useful and fulfilling life as a good citizen .
good luck , spud .
cheers , cowboy .
now remember , if they think you' re not trying , you' re in trouble , right ?
first hint of that , and they' il be onto the d. h. s. s. , " this cunt is not trying .
and your giro' s fuckin ' finished , right ?
right .
but , then again , try too hard
you might get the fuckin ' job .
exactly .
nightmare .
it' s a tightrope , spud .
it' s a fuckin ' tightrope .
see , i just get pure shy with the interviewer cats .
i get all nervous .
i can' t answer any of their questions , like i' m a footballer ... and i get nerves on the big occasion , man .
try some of this , spud .
yeah , a little dab of speed is just the ticket , mate .
no , i went to craignewton .
i just put down royal edinburgh college to help get the job .
there' s too much discrimination in this town , man .
they' re both schools , right ?
we' re all in this together .
and i wanted to put across the general idea , rather than the details .
like people get all hung up on details .
like which school did i go to ?
how many grades did i get ?
could be like six .
could be none .
it' s not important .
what is important is that i am , yes ?
mr. murphy , do you mean that you lied on your application ?
no well , yes .
only to get my foot in the door .
showing initiative and that like .
but you were referred here by the department of employment .
there was no need for you to get your " foot in the door , " as you put it .
yeah , cool .
whatever you say .
sorry .
you' re the man , the dude in the chair .
i am merely here like , well , obviously , i' m here like , but
mr. murphy , what exactly attracts you to the leisure industry ?
in a word , pleasure .
like , my pleasure in other people' s leisure .
do you see yourself as having any weaknesses ?
oh , yes , ' cause , like , i' m a bit of a perfectionist , actually !
yes , i am .
see , for me , it' s got to be the best , or it' s nothing at all .
like things get a bit dodgy , i just cannot be bothered .
but , hey , i' m getting good vibes about this interview thing today , though , man .
seems to me like it' s going pretty well , eh ?
thank you , mr. murphy .
we' il let you know .
the pleasure was mine , man .
spud had done well .
i was proud of him .
thanks .
ooh , sorry .
he fucked up good and proper .
you had to hand it to spud .
picture the scene .
the other fuckin ' week there ... doin ' the fuckin ' volley with tommy playing pool .
i' m playin ' like paul fuckin ' newman by the way ... givin ' the boy here the tannin ' of a lifetime .
so it comes to the last shot , the deciding ball of the whole tournament .
i' m in the black , and he' s sittin ' in the corner looking all fucking biscuit arsed .
when this hard cunt comes in .
obviously fucking fancied himself like .
starts staring at me .
looking at me , right fucking at me , as if to say , " come ahead , square go .
you know me .
i' m not the type of cunt that goes looking for fucking bother ... but at the end of the day , i' m the cunt with the pool cue ... and he can get the fat end in his puss any time he fucking wanted , like .
so i squares up , casual like .
what does the hard cunt do ?
or the so called hard cunt ?
shites it .
puts down his drink , turns and gets the fuck out of there .
and after that , well , the game was mine .
and that was it .
that was begbie' s story ... or , at least , that was begbie' s version of the story .
but a couple of days later , i got the truth from tommy .
you always got the truth from tommy .
that was one of his major weaknesses .
he never told lies , he never took drugs , and he never cheated on anyone .
it was wednesday morning .
we were in the volley playing pool .
that much is true .
but begbie is playing absolutely fucking gash .
he' s got a hangover so bad , he can hardly hold the fucking cue , never mind pot a ball .
i' m doing my best to lose , you know .
trying to humor him , like , but it' s not doing any good .
every time i touch a ball , i seemed to pot something .
every time begbie goes near the table , he fucks it up .
oh , fuck' s sake .
so , he' s got the hump , right .
but , finally , i managed to set it up ... so all he has to do is to pot the black ... to win one game , to salvage a little bit of pride ... and maybe not kick my head in , right .
so , he' s on the black .
pressure shot .
and it all goes wrong big time .
fuck !
he picks on this specky , wee gadge at the bar ...
and accuses him of putting him off by looking at him .
could you believe it ?
the poor wee cunt hasn' t even glanced in our direction .
fuck off !
he was gonna chib him , i tell you .
then i thought he was gonna do me .
the beggar' s fucking psycho , man .
but ... he' s a mate .
you know ?
so what can you do ?
can i borrow this ?
what , indeed , could one do ?
just stand back and watch and try not to get involved ?
begbie didn' t do drugs either .
he just did people .
that' s what he got off on .
his own sensory addiction .
hey !
nobody move !
that lassie got glassed ... and no cunt leaves here ' til we find out what cunt did it !
who the fuck are you ?
oh , lizzy , you' ve been so good to me .
oh , tommy , come here .
and as i sat watching ... the intimate and highly personal video ... stolen only hours earlier from one of my best friends ...
i realized that something important was missing from my life .
leave no track
don' t look back
only desire temptation
we' re climbing higher and higher temptation
adorable creature temptation
you' ve got acceptable features temptation
trouble is coming temptation
it' s just the high cost of loving temptation
you can take it or leave it temptation
but you' d better believe it
i read it in cosmopolitan .
it' s an interesting theory .
actually , it' s a nightmare .
i' ve been desperate for a shag , but watching him suffer is just too much fun .
you should try it with tommy .
what ?
and deny myself the only pleasure i get from him ?
did i tell you about my birthday ?
no , what happened ?
he forgot .
useless motherfucker .
leave no trace
find your place
all i desire temptation
we' re climbing higher and higher temptation
you can take it or leave it temptation
but you' d better believe it
what are you two talking about ?
football .
what are you talking about ?
shopping .
the situation was becoming serious .
young renton noticed ... the haste with which the successful in the sexual sphere ... as in all others , segregated themselves from the failures .
i can' t break away keep us from temptation
keep us from temptation [ renton narrating ]
heroin had robbed renton of his sex drive ...
but now it returned with a vengeance .
lead us not into temptation
and as the impotence of those days faded into memory ... grim desperation took ahold in his sex crazed mind .
his post junk libido , fueled by alcohol and amphetamine ... taunted him remorselessly with his own unsatisfied desire .
dot , dot , dot .
you think that you' re right now temptation
you' ve got to face up to fact now temptation
ooh , give me a breakdown temptation
because it' s time for a showdown temptation
temptation , temptation temptation
oh , oh oh oh
make me tonight
tonight [ renton narrating ]
and with that , mark renton had fallen in love .
excuse me , excuse me .
i don' t mean to harass you , but i was very impressed ... with the capable and stylish manner in which you dealt with that situation .
i was thinking to myself , now this girl' s special .
thanks .
what' s your name ?
diane .
where are you going , diane ?
i' m going home .
where' s that ?
it' s where i live .
great .
what ?
i' il come back with you if you like , but i' m not promising anything .
do you find that this approach usually works ?
or , let me guess , you' ve never tried it before .
in fact , you don' t normally approach girls .
am i right ?
the truth is that you' re a quiet , sensitive type ... but , if i' m prepared to take a chance ...
i might just get to know the inner you : witty , adventurous , passionate , loving , loyal
taxi !
a little bit crazy , a little bit bad .
but , hey , don' t us girls just love that ?
eh ?
well ... what' s wrong , boy ?
cat got your tongue ?
i left something  [ driver ]
you getting in or not , pal ?
do you understand ?
i expect you to be a considerate and thoughtful lover .
generous but firm .
what ?
failure on your part ... to live up to these very reasonable expectations ... will result in swift resumption of a non sex situation .
right ?
diane .
shh .
what ?
shut up !
wake up , spud .
wake up .
sex .
casual sex .
tommy , let' s put the tape on .
now ?
i want to watch ourselves while we' re screwing .
so let' s see what i' m missing .
not much .
and there' s the captain , archie gemmill ... picking it up from the outside .
i think he wants to go himself .
how far is he gonna go ?
he' s going all the way , and he scores !
oh , what a magnificent goal !
gemmill at his very best !
what a penetrating goal that was !
i haven' t felt that good ... since archie gemmill scored against holland in 1978 .
renton ...
you can' t sleep here .
what ?
out .
come on .
no argument .
you can sleep on the sofa in the hall or go home .
it' s up to you .
and don' t make any noise .
jesus .
what do you mean , it' s gone ?
where has it gone , tommy ?
it' il be here somewhere !
i might have returned it by mistake .
returned it " ?
where ?
the video shop , tommy ?
the fucking video shop ?
so every punter in edinburgh is jerking off to our video ?
oh , god , tommy , i feel sick !
hi .
hello .
eh ?
come in and sit down .
like some coffee ?
aye .
you must be mark .
aye , that' s me .
you' re a friend of diane' s ?
more a friend of a friend , no ?
right .
are you her flatmates ?
flatmates " ?
i must remember that one .
' morning .
good morning , spud .
' morning , gail .
mr. houston .
mrs. houston .
' morning , spud .
sit down and have some breakfast .
sorry about last night , by the way .
that' s all right .
i slept fine on the sofa .
i had a bit much to drink .
i had a bit of an accident .
don' t worry , son .
these things happen .
does a man good to cut loose once in awhile .
only this one could do with being tied up once in a while .
i' il put the sheets in the machine .
no , no , no .
i' il i' il wash them .
there' s no need .
no , it' s no problem .
it' s no problem for me either .
i' d rather take care of it myself .
honestly , it' s no problem .
really , no !
spud , they' re my sheets !
i don' t see why not .
because it' s illegal , that' s why not .
what , holding hands ?
no , not holding hands .
in that case , you can do it .
you were quite happy to do a lot more last night .
yeah , that' s what' s illegal .
do you know what they do to people like me inside ?
they cut your balls off and flush ' em down the fucking toilet .
calm down .
you' re not going to jail .
oh , well , that' s very easy for you to say , diane .
can i see you again ?
certainly not .
if you don' t see me again , i' il tell the police .
i' il see you around then .
now what ?
we go for a walk .
what ?
a walk .
where ?
there .
are you serious ?
well , what are you waiting for ?
hey , tommy ... this is not natural , man .
it' s the great outdoors !
it' s fresh air !
look , tommy , we know you' re getting a hard time off lizzy ... but there' s really no need to take it out on us .
doesn' t it make you proud to be scottish ?
it' s shite being scottish !
we' re the lowest of the low !
the scum of the fucking earth !
the most wretched , miserable , servile , pathetic trash ... that was ever shat into civilization !
some people hate english .
i don' t !
they' re just wankers !
we , on the other hand , are colonized by wankers !
can' t even find a decent culture to be colonized by !
we' re ruled by effete arseholes !
it' s a shite state of affairs to be in , tommy !
and all the fresh air in the world won' t make any fucking difference !
sorry , man .
sorry .
no , i' m sorry .
look , i appreciate it , tommy [ renton narrating ]
at or around this time , spud , sick boy and i ... made a healthy , informed , democratic decision ... to get back on heroin as soon as possible .
it took about 12 hours .
it looks easy this , but it' s not .
it looks like a doss , like a soft option .
but living like this is a full time business .
ursula andress , the quintessential bond girl .
that' s what everyone says .
the embodiment , right , of his superiority to us .
beautiful , exotic , highly sexual .
yet totally unavailable to anyone apart from him .
shite .
i mean , let' s face it , mate .
she' d shag one punter from edinburgh , she' d shag the whole fucking lot of us .
well done .
yep , i knew he was gonna do that .
nightclubbing we' re nightclubbing
lizzy' s gone , mark .
she' s gone and fucking dumped me .
it was that videotape ... and that lggy pop business and all other sorts of shite .
she told me where to go and no fucking mistake .
i said to her , i said , " look , is there any chance of getting back together ?
no way .
no fucking way .
honor blackman ... a . k . a .
pussy galore , right ?
what a total fucking misnomer .
i mean i would not touch her with yours .
i want to try it , mark .
you' re always going on about how it' s the ultimate hit and that .
better than sex .
come on , man , i' m a fucking adult .
i can find out for myself .
i' ve got the money .
personality .
i mean , that' s what counts , right ?
personality .
i mean that' s what keeps a relationship going through the years .
like heroin .
i mean , heroin' s got great fucking personality .
nightclubbing we' re nightclubbing
we' re walking through town
nightclubbing we' re nightclubbing [ renton narrating ]
swanney taught us to adore and respect the national health service ... for it was the source of much of our gear .
we stole drugs .
we stole prescriptions or bought them ... sold them , swapped them , forged them , photocopied them .
or traded drugs with cancer victims ... alcoholics , pensioners , alds patients , epileptics and bored housewives .
we took morphine , diamorphine , cyclozine , codeine , temazepam ... nitrazepam , phenobarbitone , and sodium amytal ... dextropropoxyphene , methadone , nalbuphine , pethidine , pentazocine ... buprenorphine , dextromoramide , chlormethiazole .
the streets are awash with drugs you can have ... for unhappiness and pain , and we took them all .
fuck it , we would' ve injected vitamin c if only they' d made it illegal .
pardon me , may i use your bathroom ?
thank you .
you' re a psycho !
hey , rent boy ... no fucking smack .
but the good times couldn' t last forever .
no !
my god , no !
i think allison had been screaming all day ...
but it hadn' t really registered before .
she might have been screaming for a week for all i knew .
it had been days since i' d heard anyone speak .
help me !
though surely someone must have said something in all that time .
surely to fuck someone must have .
allison .
allison !
help me , please !
hey , calm down !
everything' il be just fine .
nothing could have been further from the truth .
in point of fact , nothing was gonna be just fine .
on the contrary , everything was gonna be bad .
bad .
i mean , everything was gonna be even worse than it already was .
no !
my god !
no !
no !
no !
my god !
no !
no !
fuck .
it wasn' t my baby .
she wasn' t my baby .
baby dawn , she wasn' t mine .
spud' s , swanney' s , sick boy' s ?
i don' t know .
maybe allison knew , maybe not .
i wished i could think of something to say .
something sympathetic , something human .
say something , mark .
fucking say something , huh ?
i' m cooking up .
cook us up a shot , rent .
i really need a hit .
and so she did .
i could understand that .
to take the pain away .
so i cooked up , and she got a hit .
but only after me .
that went without saying .
well , at least we knew who the father was now .
it wasn' t just the baby that died that day .
something inside sick boy was lost and never returned .
it seemed he had no theory with which to explain a moment like this , nor did l .
our only response was to keep on going and fuck everything .
pile misery upon misery .
heap it up on a spoon and dissolve it with a drop of bile .
then squirt it into a stinking , purulent vein and do it all over again .
keep on going , getting up , going out , robbing , stealing , fucking people over .
propelling ourselves with longing towards the day it would all go wrong .
because no matter how much you stash ... or how much you steal , you never have enough .
no matter how often you go out and rob and fuck people over ... you always need to get up and do it all over again .
gangway !
sooner or later , this kind of thing was bound to happen .
because shoplifting is theft , which is a crime ... and , despite what you may believe , there is no such entity as victimless crime .
heroin addiction may explain your actions , but it does not excuse them .
mr. murphy , you are a habitual thief ... devoid of regret and remorse .
in sentencing you to six months imprisonment , my only worry is ... that it will not be long before we meet again .
mr. renton , i understand that you have entered into a program ... of rehabilitation in an attempt to wean yourself away from heroin .
the suspension of your sentence ... is conditional on your continued cooperation with this program .
should you stand guilty before me again , i shall not hesitate ... to impose a custodial sentence .
thank you , your honor .
with god' s help , i' il conquer this terrible affliction .
what can you say ?
well , begbie had a phrase for it .
it was fucking obvious that that cunt was going to fuck some cunt .
well , i hope you learned your lesson , son .
oh , my son .
i thought i was gonna lose you there .
you' re nothin ' but trouble to me , but i still love you .
you' d better clean up your fucking act , sunshine .
cut that shite out forever .
you listen to francis , mark .
he' s talking sense , kid .
you' re fucking right i am .
see , inside , you wouldn' t last two fucking days .
there' s better things than the needle , rents .
choose life .
i remember when you were a wee baby .
oh , mama' s little baby loves shortening , shortening
mama' s little baby loves shortening bread [ singers laughing , laughter stops ]
i' m sorry , mrs. murphy .
it wasn' t fair , spud going down and not me .
well , it' s not our fault !
your boy went down because he was a fucking smack head !
if that' s not your fault , then i don' t know what is !
i was the fucking cunt that tried to get him off it .
i' il get the fucking drinks then , eh ?
aye .
i wished i' d gone down instead of spud .
here i was surrounded by my family and my so called mates ... and i' ve never felt so alone .
never in all my puff .
since i was on remand , they' ve had me on this program .
the state sponsored addiction .
three sickly sweet doses of methadone a day instead of smack .
but it' s never enough .
and , at the moment , it' s nowhere near enough .
i took all three this morning ... and now i' ve got 18 hours to go ' til my next shot ... and the sweat on my back like a layer of frost .
i need to visit the mother superior , for one hit .
one fucking hit ... to get us over this long , hard day .
what' s on the menu this evening , sir ?
your favorite dish .
excellent .
usual table , sir ?
why , thank you .
would sir care to pay for his bill in advance ?
no , stick it on my tab .
ah , regret to inform , sir , credit limit was reached and breached some time ago .
oh , well , in that case
ah , hard currency .
that' il do nicely .
can' t be too careful ... when we' re dealing with your type , can we , sir ?
would sir care for a starter ?
some garlic bread , perhaps ?
no , thank you .
i' il proceed directly to the intravenous injection ...
of hard drugs , please .
as you wish , sir .
as you wish .
just a perfect day
drink sangria in the park
and then later [ swanney ]
perhaps sir would like me to call for a taxi ?
just a perfect day
feed animals in the zoo
then later , a movie too
and then home [ siren continues ]
oh , it' s such a perfect day
i' m glad i spent it with you
oh , such a perfect day
you just keep me hanging on [ brakes squeak ]
you just keep me hanging on [ engine ldling ]
just a perfect day
problems are left alone
weekenders on our own

i' m in the junkie limbo at the moment .
too ill to sleep , too tired to stay awake .

the human immunodeficiency virus is a
retrovirus .
retrovirus is the right answer !
it' s a mug' s game , mrs. renton .
i mean , i' m not saying i was blameless myself .
far from it .
but there comes a time when you have to turn your back on all that nonsense ... and just say no .
just say no .
oh , my god , she' s dead !

h. i. v. binds to which receptor on the host lymphocyte ?
which receptor is that ?

for goodness sake , mark .
it seems , however , i am the luckiest guy in the world .
several years of addiction right in the middle of an epidemic ... surrounded by the living dead .
but not me .
i' m negative .
it' s official .
and once the pain goes away , that' s when the real battle starts : depression , boredom .
you feel so fucking low , you want to fucking top yourself .
tommy !
tommy !
tommy , it' s mark , man .
all right , mate ?
gettin ' out much , tommy ?

following the game at all ?

no , i' m clean , man .
well ... sub us then , mate .
i' m expecting a rent check .
thanks , mark .
no bother .
no bother .
none at all .
not for me , anyway .
still , it' s easy to be philosophical ... when it' s some other poor cunt with shite for blood .
what do you want ?
are you clean ?
yes .
is that a promise then ?
yes , it is , as a matter of fact .
calm down .
i' m only asking .
is that hash i can smell ?
no .
i wouldn' t mind a bit if it is .
well , it isn' t .
it smells like it .
you' re too young .
i' m too young for what ?
you' re not getting any younger , mark .
the world' s changing .
music' s changing .
even drugs are changing .
you can' t stay in here all day dreaming about heroin ...
and ziggy pop .
it' s lggy pop .
whatever .
i mean , the guy' s dead anyway .
iggy pop is not dead .
he toured last year .
tommy went to see him .
the point is , you' ve got to find something new .
she was right .
i had to find something new .
there was only one thing for it .
so find the feelin '
so find the feelin '
so find the feelin '

lifestyle letting agency .
oh , yes , it' s a beautifully converted victorian town house .
ideally located on a quiet road near to the local shops and transport .
um , this one' s two bedrooms and a kitchen/ diner .
fully fitted , in excellent decorative order .
lots of storage space and all mod cons .
it' s going at 320 a week .
i settled in not too badly and kept myself to myself .
sometimes , of course , i thought about the guys , but mainly i didn' t miss them at all .
after all , this was boomtown , where any fool could make cash from chaos , and plenty did .
tell you what i' ve got .
i' ve got a beautifully converted victorian town house .
i quite enjoyed the sound of it all : profit , loss , margins ... takeovers , lending , letting , subletting ... subdividing , cheating , scamming , fragmenting , breaking away .
who' s got the keys to telegraph road ?
there was no such thing as society , and even if there was ...
i most certainly had nothing to do with it .
for the first time in my adult life , i was almost content .
dear mark , i' m glad you found a job and somewhere to live .
school is fine at the moment .
i' m not pregnant , but thanks for asking .
your friend , sick boy , asked me last week if i would like to work for him ... but i told him where to go .
i met spud , who sends his regards .
or at least i think that' s what he said .
no one has seen tommy for ages .
and , finally , francis begbie has been on television a lot this week ... as he is wanted by the police in connection ... with an armed robbery in a jeweler' s in corstorphine .
take care .
yours with love , diane .
francis begbie .
oh , no .
armed robbery ?
what , with a replica ?
how the fuck can it be armed robbery with a fucking replica ?
fucking scandal .
the gear .
look .
supposed to be fucking solid silver .
it' s fucking garbage .
those young couples investin ' all their fucking hopes in that stuff and all .
it' s a scandal , franco .
too fucking right it is .
how about the wee pot noodles by the way ?
i' m fucking lee marvin .
hey , rents .
begbie settled in in no time at all .
fucking find cigarettes .
we didn' t have nowhere to live
aye .
we didn' t have nowhere to go
' til someone said i know this place i' ve been before
it was on the 15th floor
it had a bar across the door [ bottles clatter ]
it took an hour to cross it off and get inside
it smelled as if someone had died
the living room was full of flies
the kitchen sink was  begs ?
ooh , it' s a mess all right begs !
yes , it' s my house [ snoring ]
yeah , the guy' s a psycho .
but it' s true .
he' s a mate also .
what can i do ?
i was living in the sky
i never thought i' d live so high
just like heaven if it didn' t look like hell
the lift is always full of piss
the fifth floor landing smells of fish
not just on friday every single other day
hey , pop down to bookie' s and put a line on for us .
can you not go yourself ?
i' m serious here .
i' m a fugitive from the law , and i can' t even walk the fuckin ' streets .
you go .
here .
doncaster .
four forty .
five pound to win .
bad boy .
fucking buy some fucking beer and all .
come on , bad boy .
come on , son .
come on , son .
come on !
come on !
yeah !
yeah !
bad boy !
came in at 16 to 1 .
and with the winnings , we went out to celebrate .
diane was right .
the world is changing .
music is changing .
drugs are changing .
even men and women are changing .
one thousand years from now , there' il be no guys and no girls , just wankers .
sounds great to me .
it' s just a pity no one told begbie .
fuck !
fuck !
lf you ask me , we' re heterosexual by default not by decision .
it' s just a question of who you fancy .
it' s all about aesthetics .
and it' s fuck all to do with morality .
fuck !
but you try telling begbie that .
look , i' m not a fucking buftie , and that' s the end of it .
let' s face it , it could have been wonderful .
fucking listen to me , you piece of junkie shit .
a joke' s a fucking joke .
you mention that again , and i' il cut you up .
you understand ?
since i last saw him ...
sick boy had reinvented himself as a pimp and a pusher ... and was here , he said , to mix business and pleasure ... setting up contacts , as he constantly informed me ... for the great smack deal that was one day going to make him rich .
good chips .
i can' t believe you did that .
i got a good price for it .
rents , i need the money .
it was my fucking telly !
christ , if i' d known you were gonna get so humpty about it ...
i wouldn' t have bothered .
fucking rented anyway .
are you gonna eat that ?
have you got a passport ?
why ?
i met this bloke .
runs a hotel , brothel .
loads of contacts .
does a nice sideline in punting british passports to foreigners .
get you a good price .
and why would i want to sell my passport ?
it was just an idea .
i had to get rid of them .
sick boy didn' t do his drug deal , and he didn' t get rich .
instead , he and begbie just hung around my bedsit looking for things to steal .
i decided to offer them one of london' s most desirable properties .
but , of course , they weren' t paying any rent .
so when my boss found two desperate suckers who would ...
sick boy and begbie were bound to feel threatened .
yep , lots of storage .
all mod cons , 320 quid a week .
and that was that .
tommy .
tommy knew he' d got the virus , but he never knew he' s gone full blown .
what was it , pneumonia or cancer ?
no , toxoplasmosis .
it' s like a stroke .
how' s that ?
he wanted to see lizzy again .
she wouldn' t even let him near the house .
so he bought her a present .
he brought her this kitten .
but lizzy told him where to fucking stick it .
exactly .
i' m not wantin ' that cat , " she says .
get the fuck , right .
so there' s tommy stuck with this kitten .
you can imagine what happened .
to those of us gathered here today ...
thomas mckenzie filled a number of different roles in our lives .
thomas was a son , a brother and a friend .
the thing was neglected ... pissing and shitting all over the place .
tommy' s lying about fucked out of his eyeballs ... on smack or downers .
he never knew you could get toxoplasmosis from cat shit .
a loving man who had a great lust for life .
a keen musician  neither did l .
what is it ?
fucking horrible .
it' s like an abscess on your brain .
fucking hell .
then what happened ?
he starts getting these headaches ...
so he just uses more smack , you know , for the pain .
right .
and then he has a stroke .
a fucking stroke , just like that .
gets home from the hospital and dies three weeks later .
he' d been dead for ages before the neighbors ... complained about the smell and got the police to break down the door .
tommy was lying facedown in a pool of vomit .
he has gone from us , but we have many things to remember him by .
the kitten was fine .
would you all please rise now for the committal ?
do you think i would leave you crying
when there' s room on my horse for two
climb up here , tommy don' t be dying
i can go just as fast with two
when we grow up we' il both be soldiers
and our horses will not be toys
and i wonder if we' il remember
when we were two little boys [ cans opening ]
tommy .
tommy .
did you tell him yet ?
on you go .
what ?
there' s this mate of swanney' s .
you know the guy .
mikey forrester .
aye .
well ... he' s come into some gear .
a lot of gear .
how much gear ?
about two kilos .
so he tells me .
he got drunk in a pub down by the docks last week ... where he met two russian sailors .
they' re fucking carrying the stuff .
for sale there and then , like .
so he wakes up next morning ... realizes what he' s done , gets very fucking nervous .
he wants rid of this , right ?
so ?
so he met me .
and i offered to take it off his hands at a very reasonable price ... with the intention of punting it on myself to a guy i know in london .
we' ve just come back from tommy' s funeral ... and you' re talking about a skag deal ?
aye .
what was your price ?
four grand .
you haven' t got four grand .
we' re 2, 000 short .
well , that' s tough .
look , mark , every cunt knows you' ve been saving up in london .
i' m sorry , boys .
i do not have two grand .
aye , you fucking do .
i' ve seen your bank statement .
for fuck' s sake .
two thousand ... one hundred and thirty three pound .
two kilos .
what is that , ten years ?
mikey forrester .
russian sailors .
what the fuck are you boys on ?
eh ?
spud , you' ve already been to jail .
what' s the deal ?
you like it so much you want to go back ?
i just want the money , mark .
if everybody keeps their fucking mouth shut , there' il be no cunt going to jail .
i hadn' t told anyone everything that was running through my mind ... about what might happen in london .
there were a lot of possibilities i didn' t want to talk to anyone about .
ideas best kept to myself .
what no one told me was that when we bought the smack ... some lucky punter would have to try it out .
begbie didn' t trust spud .
sick boy was too careful these days .
so i rolled up my sleeve , i spiked my vein ... and i did what had to be done .
it' s good .
oh , it' s really fucking good .
yeah , that hit was good .
i promised myself another one before we got to london .
just the one hit .
just for old time' s sake .
just to piss begbie off .
this was his nightmare .
the dodgiest scam in a lifetime of dodgy scams .
being perpetrated with three of the most useless and unreliable fuckups in town .
i knew what was going on in his mind .
any trouble in london , and he would dump us immediately .
one way or another , he had to .
if he got caught with a bag full of smack ... on top of that armed robbery shit , he was going down for 15 to 20 .
begbie was hard , but not so hard that he didn' t shite it off 20 years in prison .
this was to be my final hit .
but let' s be clear about this .
there' s final hits and final hits .
what kind was this to be ?
did you bring the cards ?
what ?
the cards .
the last thing i told you was to mind the cards .
well , i' ve not brought them .
fucking boring after a while without the cards .
i' m sorry .
but fucking late , like .
why didn' t you bring them ?
' cause i fucking told you to bring them , you doss cunt !
christ .
these are your friends , right ?
these are the guys i told you about .
okay .
well , is he here ?
yeah , he' s here .
you didn' t get followed or nothing , did you ?
didn' t get followed .
okay .
all right .
hi .
straight away he clocked us for what we were : small time wasters with an accidental big deal .
excuse me , gentlemen .
so ... how much would you like for this ?
twenty thousand .
well , i don' t think it' s worth much more than 15 .
this was a real drag to him .
he didn' t need to negotiate .
i mean , what the fuck were we going to do with it if he didn' t buy it ?
sell it on the streets ?
fuck that .
well , 19 .
terribly sorry .
i can' t go to 19 .
well , fucking 16 then .
okay .
well , fucking 16 " it is then .
these , gentlemen , are 2, 000 bundles .
that' s two .
that' s four .
we settled on 16, 000 .
now you have six .
he had a lot more in the suitcase , like , but it was better than nothing .
and two more make eight .
thank you very much , gentlemen .
i' d just like to say , it' s been a pleasure haggling with you .
fucking better be .
okay ?
yes !
fucking  [ continue laughing ]
and just for a moment , it felt really great .
like we were all in it together , like friends .
like it meant something .
a moment like that can touch you deep inside .
but it doesn' t last long .
not like 16, 000 .
so what about you , spud ?
any major investments on the horizon at all ?
gonna buy yourself a wee island in the sun ?
for four grand ?
one palm tree , a couple of rocks and a fucking sewage outflow .
i don' t know , man .
i' m gonna get something for my ma , i think .
get some good speed .
no bicarb .
then get a girl , take her out , treat her right .
and shag her senseless .
no , man !
true love .
true love .
eh , but i could really handle some hot sex ...
with a jewish princess !
you daft cunt !
or a catholic !
if you' re gonna waste it on a bird ... you might as well fucking leave it all to me .
get our drinks .
i got a round already .
i got the last ones .
it' s your round , franco .
okay .
same again ?
right .
i' m off for a piss .
see when i get back the money' s still here , okay ?
the moment your back' s turned , we' re out the door .
yeah , i' il be right fucking after you .
you' il never catch us , you flabby bastard .
by the way , see you when i get back .
be halfway down the street with the money .
i' d fucking kill you .
aye , i thought you might , franco .
thought you might .
are you game for it ?
what ?
well ?
are you serious ?
don' t know .
don' t know .
what do you think ?
still here , i see .
aye .
well , we wouldn' t run out on a mate , eh ?
why not ?
i know i would .
where' s franco ?
for fuck' s sake !
sorry , mate .
i' il buy you another one .
you' ve ruined my fucking suit , you fucking idiot !
look , i' m sorry .
i didn' t mean it .
sorry' s not going to dry me off , you cunt .
cool down , franco .
the man says he' s sorry .
he' s sorry enough for being a fat cunt .
fuck you .
if you can' t hold a pint , you shouldn' t be in the pub , mate .
fuck off .
oh , no !
no , franco , don' t do it , man .
for fuck' s sake !
fucking nice one , franco !
shut it .
you cut me , man !
you were in my fucking way .
anybody else want to get in my fucking way ?
you ?
you ?
hey , rent boy ... you bring me down a fucking smoke .
i think we' d better go , franco !
i' ve got to go to the hospital !
you' re not going to any fucking hospital , and you' re staying there !
you bring me down a fucking cigarette .
and the bag .
now i' ve justified this to myself in all sorts of ways .
it wasn' t a big deal , just a minor betrayal .
or we' d outgrown each other .
you know , that sort of thing .
but let' s face it .
i ripped them off .
my so called mates .
but begbie i couldn' t give a shit about him .
and sick boy .
he' d have done the same to me , if he' d only thought of it first .
and spud well , okay , i felt sorry for spud .
he never hurt anybody .
bastard !
bastard !
open up .
open up now !
bastard !
bastard !
so why did i do it ?
i could offer a million answers , all false .
the truth is that i' m a bad person .
but that' s gonna change .
i' m going to change .
this is the last of that sort of thing .
now i' m cleaning up , and i' m moving on .
going straight and choosing life .
i' m looking forward to it already .
i' m gonna be just like you .
