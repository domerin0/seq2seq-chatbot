we completed our search of the world of darkness .
that would be your bats , your leopard cats , your mole rats .
we came up empty , sir .
there' s no place like home .
it' s gotta be a building .
we checked them all .
we checked the monkey house , the reptile house , the giraffe house .
even the outhouse .
we scanned the entire grounds to a depth of 20 feet .
this guy was a heavy equipment operator .
five minutes with a machine , he could' ve buried the gold anywhere .
so where does that leave us , sir ?
square fucking one .
come on , let' s go check the outhouse again .
let' s go .

citadel 4 is the same system we use to safeguard our nuclear facilities .
this guy took it apart like he was hot wiring a toyota .
i' il give you the short version .
we' re talking world class loner .
a guy who spent literally tens of thousands of hours at a computer ... ... feeling around in the dark .
nothing but math .
nothing but numbers .
his sense of well being , his very sanity is predicated on completion .
only this time , the equation is incomplete .
he didn' t get the 42 million in gold he' d worked so very hard for .
that' s our edge .
now this ....
this is what i need your money for .
it' s a bc 19 .
it' s an experimental tracking device .
dr. harris here can fill you in .
well , it' s quite simple , really .
the bc 19 has a proprietary signal ... ... broadcast and location .
it' s got a 10 mile radius and full satellite coordinate tracking .
now , the optimum placement site ... ... is the temporal mandibular joint .
it' s just below the jaw .
all right , look ... ... we implant this in the appropriate subject , put him ... ... on the street , make it known he knows where the gold is ... ... and i guarantee that our elusive computer whiz will show up .
who would be willing to have that thing implanted in their jaw ?
senator ... ... we already have a volunteer .
this is howard cosell .

listen to me .
i had a grandfather who was a trapper by profession .
now he had two prices on his card : wolf ... ... and everything else .
now a wolf . .. ... will starve itself to death ... ... rather than make a mistake .

i knew it really well .
i know .
your dad trained horses .

he was a groom .
i lied about that .
but he was a great groom .
with the thoroughbreds , he was magic .
i say he was the best .
but , you know , job didn' t pay shit .
so , therefore , our christmases , we didn' t get jack shit .
which really pissed him off .
one day he just went to this toy store and just stole all these toys .
robbed them .
brought the toys over to the crib .
i was like , " damn , santa claus got the wrong address or what ?
so i' m bouncing from toy to toy like i' m some kind of drunk dude .
mom' s smiling .
my father' s smiling .
it' s all good , right ?
then around 8 : 30 , cops show up .
take the toys , take my father .
but for about two and a half hours ... ... l had a very , very happy childhood .
why are you telling me all this ?
because i love you .
talk about a bunch of crap .
it' s all in his file , sir .
it' s all true .
he knows so much , why not get a job at the track ?
he' s had a record since he' s 14 .
can' t work there with a record .
oh , they all got sob stories .
he' s just trying to get laid .

mocha .
mocha cappuccino .
who is it ?
registered letter for alvin sanders .
who' s it from ?
uncle sam .
damn .
i just got out , man .
why you bugging me ?
i know my rights .
it says in the constitution on page 53 , " we the people ... ... in order to keep shit straight " quit messing with me .
i think it' s a check .

butt naked in the forest , but does anybody hear me ?
what are you doing here ?
what ?
i' m here to see you .
listen , i got great news .
you found a job !
no , no , not yet .
but i got something better than that .
you said things would be different this time .
things are very different .
look at this .
i got a check from the government for $5000 .
the government gave you $5000 .
all right , tell me anything .
the government gave me a check .
i signed it over to you .
what the fuck is he doing ?
that' s our money he' s giving away .
actually , it' s taxpayer money .
i could give you this money .
it' il pay for some of the things ... ... like the back rent .
some of the money i borrowed
like the stereo you sold .
i sold the stereo ?
or the vcr you took .
i took the vcr ?
the blender my mama gave me .
the blender was cheap .
i didn' t get that much money for the blender .
i' m not taking it , alvin .
i don' t think you understand .
i been trying to get a job .
it' s hard right now .
that' s a lot of money .
i think you need it more than i do .
take some money and get gregory something .
get him platinum baby pieces or something like that , you know .
he' il probably be a little rapper .
no , maybe he' s gonna be a doctor .
why would he want to do that ?
doctor' s great .
i was thinking you thinking like i' m thinking .
just take the money .
get him some toys .
say it' s from his father .
alvin , honestly , have you really been trying to find a job ?
i have been out there .
you sound like my mom .
i want you to get this money .
go get you a nice dress .
we can kick it .
i can romance you .
look at your brown eyes .
now , come on .
get back to work before we both be out of work .
okay , step .
thank you .
sorry , my man .
don' t mention it .
now what do we do ?
simple .
we give him more money .
you sure that' s necessary ?
he ' s trying to change .
he ' il never change .
we just gotta keep him clean for a few more days .
well , how much money ?
sixty five hundred .
wouldn' t it be cheaper to send him to nyu ?
how do you feel about working in alaska ?
i' il get right on this .
you gotta help me , man !
you gotta help me !
get your damn hands off me .
slow down coming through here , now .

i' m passing whuppings out .
okay , okay , i see what you doing .

i' m not complex .
you' re complex .

i think that' s a reasonable assumption .
i hope you like soup ... ... because i' m about to knock every one of your teeth ...
... down your throat .
excuse me .
can you tell me how to get to the fashion museum ?
i' m a little lost .
put the gun down .

there' s a message in your name .
and nobody just breaks into netscape .
okay ?
nobody is that smart .
hello , alvin , it seems we have some unfinished business .
unfortunately , your phones are being tapped ... ... and you' re being followed .

it' s a blackout situation .
we are negative on all signals .
scanning visual matrix .
negative .
we could try to isolate a pitch .
it' s a million to one shot .
i would like to make a deal with the united states treasury department .
sir ?
it' s wooly' s channel .
can we trace it ?
i' d like to trade the life ofa treasury agent . .. ... for the 42 million in gold .
transferring signal .
since you don' t have my gold , i' il settle for the next best thing .
if you want mr. wooly alive , turn over mr. sanders to me .
midtown winslett , 36th street .
lisa , what' s wrong with you ?
girl , what' s wrong with you ?
alvin !
alvin , get up , baby .

come on , come on , please get up .
alvin , please get up .
why are you doing this to us ?
why ?
why are you doing this to us ?
give us a break .
did you have a nice sleep ?
what' d you do with lisa ?
i put her in the other room with gregory .
they' re fine .
this is new york .
we don' t play these type of games here .
you see , alvin , i just want what' s mine .
i was used by the government , and now they' re using you .
i have nothing to do with the government .
oh , yes , you do .
they used you to get to me ... ... and i might add , quite effectively .
here i am .
now for your sake ... ... let' s hope you can help me find my gold .
gold ?
give me a pen .
i would like to make a deal with the united states treasury department .
that son of a bitch .
i' d like to trade the life ofa treasury agent
he knew alvin was being surveilled .
this whole thing was just a diversion .
if you want mr. wooly
all right , the drill is simple .
we find alvin before he does .
the math on this is extremely problematic .
you have information .
i need it .
you don' t provide that information , i have to kill you .
what are my options ?
well ....
obviously ... ... there' s torture .
no , come on .
you' re more creative than that .
that' s ... uh uh .
that' s a point well taken , alvin .
and besides , torture ... ... it' s unpleasant .
yeah .
it' s loud .
you' re right .
so unpredictable .
wait , no , hold on .
no , wait .
see ... ... did that really hurt ?
and if so , how much ?
nobody really knows .
i do not have the time ... ... l do not have the manpower , and i do not have the assets for error .
do you understand that ?
do you get that ?
i am tired of fucking around with you , alvin !
when you get your money , you need to get an anger management class .
you !
no , you' re not very smart , are you ?
the only reason you' re alive is because i allow it !
shut up !
shut up !
you like little kids , right ?
that' s my boy in there .
i can' t let nothing happen to him .
it don' t matter what' s going on between us .
i' il do anything .
he ain' t got nothing to do with this .
it' s between us .
let' s make this shit work .
let' s go get that gold , man .
i' m sorry for that primitive outburst .
i' ve decided the best course of action ... ... is to contrast the fear of certain death with an indulgent incentive .
force you to choose between the extremes .
i' m prepared to offer you the same deal i had with jaster .
we find the gold , you get to keep six bricks to do with as you please .
roughly one million dollars .
and , alvin ... ... it' s a one time , non negotiable offer .
the offer is a million dollars ... ... or you kill me .
correct .
a million ain' t what it used to be with taxes .
if that' s all you got ... ... we' il work with that .
clear .
what is that ?
it' s coffee , sir .
i wonder why he didn' t kill him .
alvin must' ve talked .
he doesn' t know anything .
i didn' t say he knew anything .
i just said he talked .
secure the building .
check the stairwell to the roof .
take more men .
all right , let' s go .
she gonna be all right , right ?
she will be , if you do what you' re supposed to do .
you' re gonna have to trust me .
i could trust you a lot better if you would let my girl and kid go .
no , no , no .
i couldn' t do that .
lisa and your little boy are motivational tools .
air unit , what do you got ?
we got nothing .
do a sweep on channel 34 .
affirmative .
night vision .
negative .
infrared .
negative .
we got nothing .
no signal .
jesus !
alvin sanders is a needle in a haystack .
can i help you ?
all right , detective wooly , go ahead .
the horses for the fifth race are on the track .
and they' re off .
let' s see what we have here .
what are you doing ?
i told you it' s in the back stables , not here .
i understand .
do you think he hid the shit in a concession stand ?
this is perfect .
glad you like it .
hey ... ... hey , little man .
daddy got to run out and take care of some business .
i' il be right back .
you take care of your mother , okay ?
i' m waiting , alvin .
yeah , i' m coming .
all right , little player .
what the hell is that ?
while i have no doubt about your sincerity , if there is no gold ... ... l' m sure you' d agree , there should be some penalty .
we don' t need these anymore ... ... considering there' s no way my little toy can be disarmed without me .
all right , alvin .
lead the way .
i told you the shit wasn' t over here .
it' s in the back , in the stalls .
what if we don' t get back in time ?
we gonna end up killing 5000 people .
perhaps we shouldn' t be standing around chatting , then .
anything happen to my kid or girl , it' s gonna be bad for you .
the horses are on the track .
it' s a major race for 4 year olds .
how much gold is there ?
roughly 42 million dollars .

how you getting all this gold out of here ?

yeah .
this is it .
all right , here we are .
right here .
nine .
no , no , no , no .
no , it' s not very logical .
logical or not ... ... it' s buried in the back .
don' t get it if you don' t have to .
i gotta get to my family .
i ain' t gotta do shit for you  all right , open it .
you can open it yourself .
i don' t give a damn .
open it !
whoa , whoa , whoa .
it' s all right .
