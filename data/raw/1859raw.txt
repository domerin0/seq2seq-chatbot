suzy bannion decided to perfect her ballet studies ...
in the most famous school of dance in europe .
she chose the celebrated academy of freiburg .
one day at 9 : 00 in the morning , she left kennedy airport , new york ,
and arrived in germany at 10 : 40 p . m .
local time .
taxi !
taxi , taxi !
taxi !
hey , taxi !
taxi !
taxi !
can you give me a hand ?
uh , escherstrausse .

escherstrausse .

suzy bannion .

you could just let me in and i' il explain .
go away .
go away !
but you don' t understand !

hello .

hello ?
if you' re happy enough with the couch , you can stay for as long as you please .
thanks , but i' il be leaving in the morning .
i' m going away forever .
oh , big deal , kid .
so what if you' ve been thrown out of school ?
i always got kicked out of school , beginning in kindergarten .
no , that' s not it .
i don' t give a damn about getting kicked out .
well , then ?
it' s useless to try and explain it to you .
you wouldn' t understand .
it all seems so ... absurd ,
so fantastic .
all i can do is get away from here as soon as possible .
would you mind if i used the bathroom ?
i' d like to dry off .
no , of course not .
go ahead .
hey , why don' t you close it ?
that' s better .
it was just the wind .
you sure are in bad shape .
you have to tell me all about it .
the wind !
the windows burst open .
i got scared .
no .
that' s not it .
i mean , what it is that' s got you so upset .
okay , you can tell me about it later .

good morning .
good morning , daniel .
good morning , miss tanner .
good morning .
may i help you ?
yes , i' m suzy bannion .
we expected you yesterday evening .
you wrote us that
right .
i did arrive last night about 10 : 00 .
but the door was locked , and somebody on the call box ...
said they didn' t know who i was and couldn' t let me in .
who said that to you ?
i don' t know .
she didn' t say her name .
i' m so sorry .
at any rate , now you' re here among us ,
so welcome to our academy .
i' m miss tanner , one of the instructors .
nice to meet you .
come along .
i' d like to introduce you to madame blanc ,
our vice directress .
she was a very famous ballerina .
madame blanc ?
yes ?
suzy bannion , our new student .
oh , yes .
excuse me , gentlemen .
of course , madame .
you' re pretty .
very pretty indeed .
they' re policemen .
i knew a woman called bannion years ago in new york .
carol bannion .
she' s my aunt .
good !
she' s a marvelous woman ,
a friend and benefactress of artists everywhere .
i' m delighted to have her niece here .
well , i offer our academy' s official welcome in the name of our directress ,
who unfortunately is not here at the moment .
she' s traveling abroad .
thank you .
albert , please wait for me upstairs .
he' s my nephew .
i' m very attached to him .
i must tell you what i have to say very quickly ...
because those gentlemen are waiting for me .
something terrible , truly horrible , has happened .
one of our students , pat hingle , who was expelled just yesterday for improper conduct ,
was murdered last night by some madman .
it' s a frightening story .
but i always warn our students , don' t i , miss tanner ?
i tell them to be careful , not to get involved with questionable friendships .
what i wanted to tell you was that your room here isn' t free yet .
just a slight hitch .
yes , but don' t worry .
we' ve found you a place to stay with one of our third year students who lives in town .
you' il have to pay 50 of your american dollars a week ,
but it' s a good price , and you can deduct it from your fee here .
now i entrust you to the care of miss tanner , one of our veteran teachers here .
don' t be upset if she seems a little stern or surly .
it' s only her manner .
she' s even that way with me .
she really is an invaluable teacher .
come with me .
and now , gentlemen
as you know , our courses last three years ,
and you must pass an exam at the end of each year .
so , the girl left the school about 11 : 00 in the evening ?
that' s my information .
excuse me .
when i got here last night about 11 : 00 , i saw a girl leaving the school .
she' s a new student .
she just arrived .
what did she look like ?
well , she had blonde hair and was wearing a brown raincoat .
what did she do ?
i don' t know .
i only saw her for a minute in a storm .
so you see ?
it really was 11 : 00 .
coming ?
we don' t teach you how to dance here , because we presume our students already know how .
this is an established academy dedicated to specializing .
this is pavlos , our general handyman .
he' s really ugly , isn' t he ? don' t be afraid to say so .
he can' t understand you , anyway .
he speaks only romanian .
you see that gorgeous smile ?
he' s been very handsome ever since he got those false teeth .
last year , he discovered he had gingivitis of the gums ,
so he had all his teeth pulled .
the top row one morning .
the bottom row a day later .
bang .
where are we going ?
to the locker room .
we also have a swimming pool , which you can use when you want .
miss tanner .
i have something to tell you .
squawk , squawk .
polly parrot .
who said that ?
shut up .
that' s enough of these little games for the moment .
i want to introduce suzy bannion , our new student .
you' il find several fellow americans among these girls miriam , for one .
hello .
hi .
your locker' s over there .
you' il find everything in there except shoes .
for today , you can borrow shoes from someone who has two pairs .
hurry up , everybody .
i' il be waiting for all of you in the red room .
come with me .
mata hari is going to file her report .
my name is olga , and you' re my tenant .
oh , hi .
nice to meet you .
they tell me you have to give me $50 a week .
yeah .
in advance .
well , don' t worry .
if you think i' m not oh
don' t get hot under the collar .
that' s how people are here .
uh , can anybody lend me a pair of shoes ?
yes .
me .
oh , thank you .
if you want to buy them , i can make you a nice price .
fifteen marks .
oh , no , thanks .
i already have some in my suitcase .
i just need a pair for today .
but if you' d rather not
no .
okay .
go ahead .
take them .
but , uh , give them back , hmm ?
of course .
oh , excuse me .
i' m sorry .
oh , it' s okay .
it doesn' t matter .
did they shake you up with all that talk about money ?
well , i' m not exactly used to it .
same with me at first .
then i found out it' s a charming habit around here .
i once read that names ...
which begin with the letter " s " ...
are the names of snakes .
next year , after i finish the course ,
i' ve got an offer from the state school of ballet in geneva .
what about you ?
well , i' il go back to yhe states , but i' m not exactly sure what i' il do .
hey , thanks .
my room is really pretty .
like it ?
uh huh .
that makes me happy .
i bet we' il do nicely together .
i think you' re sweet .
even if i have the name of a snake ?
i was just kidding .
don' t tell me you' re as touchy as sara .
no .
hello ?
oh , hi !
no , no , no .
you did the right thing .
hi .
hi .
oh , you didn' t have to bring these over here .
i could' ve picked them up myself tomorrow .
i thought you might be needing them .
yes , but it really wasn' t necessary .
anyway , thanks a lot .
oh , no .
it' s nothing .
ciao .
ciao .
don' t you want to stay for a while ?
no , thanks .
i can' t .
i live at the school , so i' ve got to be back for supper in half an hour .
i have to .
just for a minute ?
no , no , really .
i have to be going .
they get very upset if you show up late for supper .
okay , sunday .
no , not before lunchtime .
well , ciao .
see you tomorrow .
bye .
no , go on .
uh huh , i know .
you caught one .
yes , yes , i can hear you very well .
didn' t you see how he was blushing ?
he' s cute , except he doesn' t have any , um
and he never has enough money for room and board at school .
that' s why that bitch tanner has got him under her thumb .
she gives him 1, 001 errands to do .
sure .
i got it .
okay .
call me back tomorrow evening .
give me a chance to think it over .
yes , yes .
okay , okay .
anyway , he is cute .
poor pat .
she liked him a lot .
that poor kid , ending up like that .
i can' t even think about it .
i heard you saw her yesterday evening .
uh huh .
outside the school .
she was acting very strange .
mumbling to herself .
she really felt terrible when they kicked her out , but she really deserved it .
there was so much noise .
god , was she difficult .
she was saying things that made no sense .
she was always arguing , causing trouble .
secret .
iris .
what ?
uh , i remember ...
she mentioned the word " secret .
and then she ... mentioned a flower
iris , i think , or a lilac .
secret flowers ?
what' s that supposed to mean ?
i don' t know .
she was a busybody .
it would' ve been easy for her to find out one of us was in a jam .
how do you like it at olga' s ?
it' s nice .
those eight on the list this morning , come with me to the yellow room .
good morning , miss tanner .
suzy .
good morning , madame blanc .
i' ve got good news for you .
we have it all arranged .
your room is ready for you .
isn' t that marvelous ?
you can move in today , if you like .
but i' d rather stay at olga' s , if it' s okay .
doesn' t matter to me , my dear ,
but in your letter of enrollment , you said you' d be boarding at the school .
i know , but  the room is free now .
well , i didn' t think it was so important .
as you wish .
if that' s what you want , so be it .
sara ?
i had no idea you were so strong willed .
i see that when you make up your mind about something ,
nothing will change it for you .
my compliments .
witch !
and then , toward the end of the 19th century ,
the technique of classical ballet ...
assumed a different , more stylized impostation .
all right .
let' s warm up .
what' s wrong ?
don' t you feel well ?
no , it' s nothing .
i just feel a little weak .
if it gets any worse , i' il just stop .
and now some exercises .
daniel , you may begin .
one , two , three and four .
and one and two ...
and three and four .
and one and two ...
and three and four .
and one  i' m sorry , miss tanner .
i feel a little weak .
can i just rest for a second ?
weak ?
come on .
it' s an easy step .
this is the first time we' ve worked together .
i want to see what you can do , how far along you are .
now , come along and join the others .
come on ; let' s go .
daniel ?
all together now .
and one and two ...
and three and four .
i can' t .
please .
and one and two ...
and three and four .
and one and two and three and four .
and one and two and three and four .
pay attention , suzy .
get those legs up higher .
you' re not paralyzed .
get those legs up higher .
and one and two and three and
pay attention , suzy .
and one and two ...
and three and four .
and one and two and three and four .
come on .
come on .
run along .
come on .
drink up .
oh , you you must drink .
no , that' s enough .
you heard what the doctor said .
drink up .
no .
you must drink .
the blood that was hemorrhaging is going back with the intake of liquids .
right , professor verdegast ?
obviously .
my dear madame .
do not be concerned .
it' s nothing , as i' ve already told the young lady .
that' s a relief , professor .
how do you feel , dear ?
uh , better .
the fault lies with your exercises .
when somebody' s been out of practice , violent movement could cause tiny tears in internal ligaments .
thus the hemorrhaging .
you look better already .
you' ve even got color back in your cheeks .
isn' t that right ?
oh , yes .
she looks much better .
ow !
hold still .
this will get you back into shape in no time .
here we are .
fine , fine .
a day or two , you' il be on your feet , as good as new .
who brought my bags here ?
olga .
what a dear .
the minute she heard you were ill , she went right home and brought your things .
oh , and she also left me your $50 , and she didn' t take a penny of it .
why why did she do that ?
if i wanted to , i would  well , my dear ,
what you need now is some peace and quiet .
if the hemorrhaging should start again , which is very improbable ,
you can telephone me .
and tanner , she is to eat bland food for about a week .
and you mustn' t let her have any fruit .
a drop of vin rose ?
yes .
good .
a glass of red wine with each meal .
it works miracles .
clears up anemia and strengthens red corpuscles .
it builds the blood .
rest well .
you' re in good hands .
suzy , we' re next door neighbors .
so , you moved in here .
well , they moved me in here .
i really didn' t want to .
you know , as soon as i got sick , your pal olga ran and got my bags ...
and threw me out of her place .
she must' ve thought i had something awfully contagious .
but i can' t stand to live in a boarding school like a ten year old .
oh , wow .
you come back strong .
yeah , you know , i feel really well .
i mean , it' s almost as if nothing had happened .
it' s incredible .
and all thanks to professor verdegast .
verdegast ?
he came to look at you ?
yeah .
come in .
hi , pavlos .
thank you .
you' d better keep an eye on that lighter .
he really likes it .
yes , but i don' t think he' s a thief .
at least you know .
are you eating up here ?
yeah , they put me on a restricted diet .
and on a restricted diet , they give you wine ?
that' s professor verdegast' s idea .
says it' il build up my blood .
the bell .
oh , god .
that means it' s only 15 minutes till supper .
i' d better change .
ciao .
see you later .
okay .
where ?
where ?
everywhere .
the whole floor .
it' s disgusting !
it' s disgusting !
where are they coming from ?
i don' t know !
let' s go and see !
they' re coming from the ceiling .
in the meantime , everybody downstairs .
don' t let anyone come up .
i' m sorry .
truly mortified .
please excuse me .
but it was nothing to do with you , madame .
no , of course not , girls .
it was not madame blanc' s fault .
we ordered those cases of food by mail ...
from a reliable firm that we thought to be honest .
obviously , it arrived spoiled .
in a few days ' time , you see what happened .
oh , it was awful .
yes , one got in my mouth .
i suppose we' re fortunate those things only reached the floor below the attic .
are the other floors all right ?
yes .
we checked them out .
just the floor where the students ' rooms are .
well , i' il take care of the problem of fumigating in the morning .
in the meantime , for tonight , i' ve thought of a makeshift arrangement .
go and see how they' re getting along , will you , dear ?
the boys have kindly offered to help ,
and they and the servants are turning the practice hall into a dormitory .
if some of you choose to find hotel rooms , i' il have no objections .
but it' s already late , and in any case ,
the inconvenience will only be for one night .
we' il all sleep together .
bravo .
you all right ?
yes , thank you .
fine .
is everything all right ?
yes , thank you .
good .
are you all right ?
yes , madame blanc .
thank you .
oh , it' s very comfortable .
just like being in camp .
good .
are you sleeping here with us , too , madame blanc ?
certainly , as are all the other teachers and miss tanner .
do the teachers live here at school ?
no , they live in town .
they leave after supper at 9 : 30 , just like clockwork .
it' s very late .
you won' t be afraid if i turn out the lights ?
good night , everyone .
good night .
good night .
is that guy hot for you ?
maybe .
that' s funny .
i heard he was , uh
of course , i' m not much of a gossip .
that' s a good one .
come on .
you tried to get him and didn' t make it .
you liar !
that' s not  why don' t you two shut up ?
some of us want to go to sleep .
hey , sara .
forget it .
it' s okay .
suzy , are you asleep ?
were you sleeping ?
no .
what' s the matter ?
you hear that snoring ?
it' s weird .
hear it ?
where do you think it' s coming from ?
behind the sheet .
lies !
what ?
they lied to us .
the directress is here .
that' s her , the one who' s snoring .
she' s the directress .
how do you know ?
i' m sure it' s her .
last year , for a while ,
i lived in one of the guest rooms ...
under the top of the stairs .
one night ,
i heard someone coming very late in ,
getting into bed in the room next to mine .
and then
then i heard this weird kind of snoring .
i tell you , it was so weird i never forgot it .
listen .
you hear that whistle ?
it' s exactly the same .
the next morning , madame blanc told me ...
that the directress had spent a few hours at the school ...
and had slept in the room next to mine .
you see ?
so i know she' s the directress .
she' s here .
she' s there .
right behind that sheet .
thank you .
i' m grateful you can take care of the fumigating so promptly .
good morning , madame blanc .
good morning , daniel .
is everything in order now ?
all cleaned up , madame .
just to be sure , we checked the other floors too .
miss tanner .
excuse me .
did the directress sleep here last night ?
no , she didn' t .
good morning , daniel .
good morning .
you know she' s away on a trip .
maybe she' il pay us a visit two weeks from now .
excuse me , miss tanner , but which class do i attend this morning ?
the second year class in the red room .
thank you .
stop !
stop !
stop !
enough .
enough !
do you know what happened ?
do you know ?
what day is it ?
your lousy , disgusting dog has bitten albert !
he took a piece out of albert' s arm .
what ?
did you all hear that ?
that miserable dog tried to mutilate a child .
madame blanc had to rush albert to a first aid center to have stitches put in !
that' s impossible .
let' s go to the first aid center .
even if you can' t see the blood , at least you can hear the poor child' s crying .
that' s enough now !
my dog' s a peaceful , faithful animal .
he' s never hurt anyone .
the boy must have done something to him first !
oh , the poor little animal !
the poor little puppy !
if i ever see him within a mile of this school again , i' il have him put to death !
stop it !
i won' t allow such talk , you understand ?
you won' t allow it ?
then get out !
you and your dog !
get moving !
you bitch !
out !
i' m going .
i' m going .
but try to understand that
that i' m blind , not deaf .
get it ?
huh ?
not deaf .
not deaf .
you understand that ?
you understand ?
ahh , fresh air !
let me out of this gilded parade .
get out !
get out of here !
good riddance !
oh , pavlos , how much longer do i have to eat like this ?
hey , listen .
there they go , right on schedule .
the teachers .
remember ?
can you hear them ?
they' re going away .
you hear them ?
yes .
i
i i don' t think they' il even miss school .
what ?
what did you say ?
wake up .
i said , it doesn' t seem to me that they' re going out .
a front door is on the left .
their footsteps are going to the right , somewhere inside the school .
jesus , suzy .
you' re a genius .
mmm .
fantastic .
how come i never noticed that before ?
suzy .
if they don' t leave , where do they go ?
wake up .
suzy .
come on .
wake up .
suzy !
i' m so sleepy .
i don' t know why .
i' m sorry .
maybe
maybe we can find out where they really go .
of course !
yes .
begin to count the steps as they go .
it' s like the search of alietne .
easy .
what is it ?
huh ?
come on .
come on ; let' s go home .
who is that ?
who' s there ?
easy , boy .
what is it ?
what' s happening ?
who' s there ?
who' s there ?
wait !
poor daniel .
torn to pieces .
incredible .
oh , yeah , but you can never put too much trust in wolfhounds .
they' re crazy .
we had two of them once at the villa in gestaad .
my god .
first pat gets murdered by a madman ,
and now daniel is killed by his dog .
yeah .
maybe there' s a hex on the place .
yeah .
let' s call in the exorcist and have it purged .
what is it ?
is something wrong ?
no , everything' s all right .
is it something personal , dear ?
no , no , it' s nothing like that .
miss tanner , would you mind ?
i' d like a few minutes alone with suzy .
well ?
what is it ?
i just wanted to talk to you about some of the things that have been happening lately .
oh , i know you' re upset by daniel' s death , as we all have been .
no , but it' s more than that .
does anybody know anything about who killed pat ?
i spoke with the chief of police just this morning .
he told me they had some definite clues .
you know that i saw her the night i arrived here .
yes , you told me that .
and that she was mumbling some strange , unrelated words .
no , you didn' t tell me that .
because it was something that didn' t make any sense .
it was in a thunderstorm .
i just didn' t pay much attention to it .
secret " and " irises .
i don' t know what they mean , but i thought they might be important .
you' ve done very well .
congratulations .
i don' t know what the words " secret " or " irises " mean either .
but i think it' s only right we should let the police know about it .
i' m only amazed you waited two days before hello ?
you really messed things up .
what are you talking about ?
because ...
maybe pat was talking to ...
someone just inside the building that night .
and we know that someone wasn' t one of the teachers .
come on .
now you' ve put them on the hunt for somebody .
what difference does that make to you ?
big difference .
because i was pat' s friend .
she was telling me something when you suddenly showed up .
she got scared and she ran away .
she was in hysterics almost .
and then she was killed .
remember that voice when you rang the bell ?
well , that was me .
i heard strange , incredible , absurd things .
pat was taking notes on them for months .
and before going away , she gave me all the notes .
i' ve only told one person , a very good friend of mine .
frank mandel .
he' s here for a convention .
i' il let you read them tonight .
suzy , wake up .
please .
wake up .
the notes are gone !
someone stole them from me !
you understand ?
they disappeared .
don' t fall asleep !
please help me !
wake up !
help me !
i can' t .
can' t ?
this is the only thing i got left , and that' s because i kept it on me .
look .
look .
what is it ?
what' s the matter with you ?
don' t you remember ?
what' s going on ?
this is the key that' il get us wherever the teachers go every night .
i thought it out yesterday evening while i was sitting here next to you .
suzy , do you know anything about witches ?
oh , no !
please !
don' t leave me alone !
i must get away !
wait !
wait !
wait , wait , wait , wait !
looking for sara ?
she' s disappeared .
but that' s impossible .
i just talked to her last night .
she left this morning , as a matter of fact , without telling anyone .
just packed her bags and left .
she was heard leaving about 6 : 00 .
you heard her leave , didn' t you ?
sara ?
oh , yes .
i heard the door close and her footsteps going down the hall .
and then i heard a car driving off down the street .
i guess someone was waiting for her .
but it' s impossible .
if she wasn' t happy here , she could' ve told someone .
why sneak off like a thief ?
hello .
may i speak to frank mandel , please ?
yes , thank you .
hello .
this is suzy bannion .
no , we' ve never met .
i' m a friend of sara' s .
yes .
hello .
do you happen to know where sara is ?
well , she disappeared from school this morning .
yes , it seems she left and took all her luggage .
yes .
uh , listen , could i see you sometime today ?
well , i' m really worried about her .
oh , great .
where ?
at the convention center .
okay .
i' il see you there .
she didn' t inform any of her classmates .
i' ve already asked all of them .
it' s very upsetting .
i can' t understand why she did it .
i' m the one who' s held responsible by their families .
i' il call her father in geneva .
perhaps she might have gone there .
i' ve already phoned sara' s father .
he' s the italian consul in geneva .
but he wasn' t there today .
he was away for the weekend .
they said he' d be back by monday , and they don' t know anything about her there .
well , do you understand why i' m so worried ?
yes , but before we both get upset , let' s wait for the father' s return .
maybe they got together this morning and went off on their own .
i know her quite well .
she was a patient of mine three years ago .
were you aware of that ?
no .
i didn' t even know you were a psychiatrist .
well , she had a nervous breakdown after her mother' s death ,
and she came to me for treatment .
after she got better again , we remained friends ,
but lately she was upset about some notions put into her head by a friend of hers .
not you , i hope ?
no .
they were kind of wild ideas .
she had discovered that the tam academy was founded ...
in 1895 by a certain helena markos , a greek immigrant ,
and that the local people believed her to be a witch .
i guess you knew that ?
no .
but i have a strange feeling ...
that somebody already told me about it or something similar .
i can' t can' t remember .
well , that really got sara' s imagination going .
earlier in the 19th century ,
the markos woman had been expelled from several european countries .
she seemed to have something about her which urged religious people to persecute her .
she also wrote a number of books , and i read that among the initiated ,
she went by the name " the black queen .
after she settled down here , she became the subject of a lot of gossip .
nevertheless , she managed to put her hands on a great deal of money ,
and she founded the tam academy
at first a sort of school of dance and occult sciences .
but that didn' t last long , because in 1905 ,
after being hounded and cursed at for ten years ,
madame markos died in a fire .
that' s all there is , as far as witchcraft is concerned .
the school was taken over by her favorite pupil .
the study of the occult was abandoned .
and soon the place became the famous dance academy .
but what does it mean to be a witch ?
well , as a believer in the material world and a psychiatrist to boot ,
i' m convinced that the current spread of belief in magic and the occult ...
is part of mental illness .
bad luck isn' t brought by broken mirrors , but by broken minds .
excuse me .
milius ?
professor milius can answer your question better than i can .
he wrote a book called paranoia or magic , and believe me ,
it' s the final word on the subject .
excuse me , milius .
if you don' t mind , i' d like you to meet a friend of mine .
fraulein .
witches .
can you tell her something about the mysterious ?
well , i have to go .
i have an appointment to keep .
keep me posted , hmm ?
hello .
i' m sorry to bother you .
ah , so , what would you like to know ?
do you believe in the existence of witches ?
ah .
i have known some women who are said to be witches .
really ?
i have studied the phenomenon for a long time .
i am of the opinion that it is an important appendage ...
of contemporary psychiatry .
you' re skeptical , my dear .
well , frankly , it is a little hard to believe .
what do witches do ?
they are malefic , negative and destructive .
their knowledge of the art of the occult gives them tremendous powers .
they can change the course of events and people' s lives , but only to do harm .
you don' t believe me ?
no , i
their goal is to accumulate great personal wealth ,
but that can only be achieved by injury to others .
they can cause suffering , sickness and even the death ...
of those who , for whatever reason , have offended them .
why do you have all this interest in the occult ?
because some friends spoke to me about witches .
i read some stuff .
have you ever heard of helena markos ?
oh , yes .
she was a very famous black queen .
a powerful witch with a tremendous talent for doing evil ,
a real mistress of magic .
she lived and died in the city .
did you know that ?
yes .
and might there exist a guild of witches ?
the correct term would be a coven of witches .
a woman becomes queen of her magic is a hundred times more powerful ...
than the rest of the coven , which is like a serpent .
its strength rests with its leader that is , with its head .
harmless .
skepticism is the natural reaction of people nowadays ,
but magic is ever present .
which means that magic is everywhere ,
and all over the world , it' s a recognized fact .
always .
mark ?
mark ?
excuse me .
where is everybody ?
they have all gone to the theater for the opening of the bolshoi .
then why didn' t anyone tell me about it ?
i don' t know .
miss tanner obtained tickets for everyone .
frank , this is suzy .
sara' s friend ?
suzy ?
hello ?
i can' t  talk louder .
i can' t hear you very well .
did something happen ?
well , i haven' t heard from sara ,
but a lot of strange things are happening .
i mean , for example , when i eat at night , i
hello ?
hello , frank ?
hello ?
can you hear me ?
frank ?
hello ?
hello ?
hello ?
hello ?
hello , frank , can you hear me ?

they don' t leave the school at all .
the front door is on the left .
their footsteps are going to the right .
two , three , four , five , six ,
seven
i can find out where they' re going by counting their footsteps .
twenty .
who' s there ?
carpet .
that' s why the footsteps stop here .
it' s impossible .
there' s gotta be another way out of here .
the secret i saw it behind the door !
three irises !
turn the blue one !
