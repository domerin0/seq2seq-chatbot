it is said that over 1 50 years ago ... ... in the town of darkness falls ... ... matilda dickson was adored by all the children .
whenever one of them lost a tooth , they would bring it to her ... ... in exchange for a gold coin ... ... earning her the name " the tooth fairy . " but fate was not kind to matilda .
one night , fire tore through her home on lighthouse point ... ... leaving her face horribly scarred .
matilda' s burned flesh was so sensitive to light , she could only go out at night ... ... always wearing a porcelain mask ... ... so no one could ever look upon her face .
one day , two children didn' t come home .
the townspeople blamed matilda .
they hanged her ... ... tearing off her mask , exposing her hideous face to the light .
and with her dying breath ... ... matilda laid a curse upon darkness falls .
the next morning , the two children were found , safe and sound .
the town buried their secret along with matilda' s body .
" what i took before in kindness ... ... i will take forever in revenge .

larry !
caitlin !

she was already dead when we got here .
i heard he was having some problems , but jesus christ .
looks like his mom put up a bit of a struggle .
okay .
kyle ?
kyle , this is dr. jenkins .
i want you to go with her .
caitlin ?
caitlin ?
caitlin .
sorry .
as i was saying , noctiphobia is very common among his age group .
now , we' ve run one cat scan and two mrls at your behest ... ... and the conclusions all say the same thing .
there' s nothing wrong with your brother .
my brother hasn' t slept more than 1 0 minutes at a time ... ... for the last three weeks .
you go tell him there' s nothing wrong with him .
we' ve run every test possible .
there' s nothing more we can do .
what happened ?
he was asleep .
i just closed the blinds .
i didn' t think that ....
i saw her .
i saw her .
it can' t be dark .
it' s okay , michael .
i won' t let them shut off the lights , okay ?
i promise .
it' il be okay .
it' s okay , michael .
hello ?
hi . ls this kyle walsh' s number ?
this is caitlin greene .
that' s not funny .
kyle .
hey , it' s cat .
you asked me to the dance but never took me .
caitlin ?
" yeah .
hey , you are ...
... hard to track down .
i know it' s been forever .
i' m sorry .
where are my manners ?
how are you ?
fine .
what do you want ?
right .
right .
it' s my brother , michael .
he' s in the hospital , and he ....
he' s really scaring me .
he won' t sleep , not even 1 0 minutes at a time ... ... and now he won' t let us shut off any of the lights .
doctors say he has something called noctiphobia or ....
night terrors .
right .
i remembered that' s what they said you had when your  when your mother was killed .
anyway , i just thought maybe you could tell me how you got over it .
i didn' t .
you must be michael .
it' s okay , man .
i' m not gonna hurt you .
i just wanna talk a little .
my name' s kyle .
your sister says you' re afraid of the dark .
makes it tough to sleep .
you get a lot of sleep ?
me neither .
well , this was a bad idea .
caitlin says that when you grow up , you' re not afraid of the dark anymore .
ls that true ?
yes .
why not ?
because you grow up and you realize that there' s nothing to be afraid of .
then why are you still afraid ?
well , sometimes old habits die hard .
you wanna see something ?
this flashlight , it' s my peace of mind .
she won' t come in the light .
who ?
you know who .
no .
i don' t know who .
yes , you do .
you' ve seen her too .
why would you say something like that , michael ?
because it' s the truth .
sometimes i think of turning off all the lights ... ... and letting her come and take me .
sometimes i think that would be easier than being so scared .
did you ever think that ?
she' s gonna kill me , you know .
no one' s gonna kill you , michael .
nothing' s gonna happen to you .
your sister won' t let it .
my sister can' t stop her .
no one can stop her .
kyle ?
i can' t believe you came .
that makes two of us .
so ....
so , what do you think ? ls he ?
what do the doctors say ?
that he' s a kid , he' s just afraid of the dark , he' s confused .
growing up here will do that to you .
listen ....
i hate to ask you this , but ... ... when your mother died , what really happened to you ?
cat , it' s
because it seems like it' s the same  no .
but the things he says  they' re just things .
but these ....
kyle ?
did michael just lose a tooth ?
yes , his last one .
but ....
come on , kyle .
you don' t still believe that , do you ?
i mean , we all grew up with it , but it was just a story to scare us .
i' m sorry , caitlin .
this was a mistake .
look , will you just ?
wait a minute , please .
i don' t think i know how to help michael .
hey , catey .
kyle ?
larry .

that' s terrific .
it' s great to see you , buddy .

i came straight from work .
so is there any reason for us to panic , or what ?
no , no .

why do you ask ?
i don' t know , i just
got it .
i don' t know what i' m doing wrong .
don' t give him any more tests .
what ?
they stuck me with every needle ... ... gave me more rorschachs than i could count , and it didn' t do a thing .
don' t let that happen to michael .
kyle walsh .
you' re gonna have to come with us .
you ever see anything like this , dad ?
ln this town , you' d be surprised .
what' s with all the flashlights ?
are you afraid of the dark ?
yes , sir .
lf you knew why , you' d think i was crazy .
klonopin .
darvocet .
shit , this one i can' t even pronounce .
doc says half of these are antipsychotics .
now , i don' t know much about medicine , but it occurs to me ... ... that if a man is taking antipsychotics , he might have a tendency to become ... ... well , psychotic .
ray' s dead .
he' s dead ?
i think you had something to do with it .
i didn' t kill him .
i didn' t do this .
no , it must have been ....
i don' t know .
he hasn' t been the same since his mom' s murder .
he' s not a killer .
how do you know ?
you haven' t seen him in 1 2 years .
because i know .
he' s a good man .
he' s been a ward of the state .
but he came to help michael .
he was in a mental hospital for nine years .
caitlin , he' s a dangerous guy .
i had a file sent over from state hospital about you .
ten feet long .
you spent a lot of time there .
major disassociative syndrome , night terrors ... ... sociopathic tendencies , three suicide attempts .
i didn' t do this .
you did it , kyle .
don' t turn away .
you killed your mother and you killed ray .
didn' t you ?
i need to call my lawyer .
i don' t believe this .
i' m going .
caitlin , i' il be in touch .
caitlin .
i have to get back to michael at the hospital .
matt .
keep working on your crap story .
hope you got a good lawyer .
i can handle this .
i can handle this .
i can handle this .
black cat .
why not ?
michael !
michael !
michael , open the door !
michael !
i' il call security .
michael ?
can you hear me ?
it' s okay .
she' s gonna get me .
it' s okay .
your brother is suffering from a form of pavor nocturnus , or night terrors .
because of his lack of sleep , he' s suffered a psychotic break .
once that occurs , the subject can' t discern what is real and what is not .
they begin to manifest a response .
how do you mean ?
a patient may hurt themselves because they believe what they dream is real .
michael feels that something is after him , wanting to kill him .
and his self inflicted wounds are consistent with this fantasy .
the good news is that there is a procedure we can perform ... ... right here , which has had an overwhelming success rate .
ls it surgical ?
no , not at all .
michael is placed in a sensory deprivation chamber .
he faces his fears and realizes there' s nothing to fear .
tests .
michael hates the dark .
yeah .
that' s the point .
ls there any other alternative ?
aggressive medication coupled with counseling .
there are no guarantees .
meanwhile , michael might hurt himself again .
ray and i were just sitting there , having drinks ... ... and walsh starts fighting with ray ....
where are my flashlights ?
lab' s not done with them .
that' s all you remember ?
the words you' re looking for are " thank you .
hey , kyle !
kyle , wait up !
i' m having a bad day , kyle .
i had a dead guy fall on me .
you want to tell me where you' re going , huh ?
kyle ?
how about a pistola ?
huh ?
no .

okay , now what ?
where' s your car ?
why ?
i need a ride .
now !
yeah .
car' s over here .
hey , man , you' ve been released into my custody .
kyle !
it' s 5 : 35 , larry .
the sun sets in 20 minutes .
you' ve got 20 minutes to get me to the hospital .
we' re almost set up .
it' il just be another 1 5 minutes .
where' s the other doctor ?
he had to get back upstate .
so you' il be doing this ?
why did you come back ?
do you know how long i' ve tried to get through to her ?
her brother' s always there and then the ghost .
a ghost ?
you , man .
nobody in this town had a chance with her .
all she could think about was you .
i need you to sign these .
what are they ?
standard consent and release of liability forms .
he' il be fine .
where are you taking me ?
this isn' t the way .
i' m not taking you to the hospital .
lay low for the judge .
i just want to help michael .
michael' s gonna be fine .
they' re putting him in a sensory dep tank .
gonna shut the lights out .
they' re putting him in the dark ?
gonna fix him ... ... stop him from becoming the next kyle walsh .
it' s gonna be okay .
i' m gonna be watching you from the other room .
lf you put me in the dark , she' il get me .
it' il all be over soon , okay ?
