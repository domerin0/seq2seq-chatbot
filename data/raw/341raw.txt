ten years ago , a crack commando unit was sent to prison by a military court ... for a crime they didn" t commit .
these men promptly escaped from a maximum security stockade to the los angeles underground .
today , still wanted by the government , they survive as soldiers of fortune .
if you have a problem , if no one else can help , and if you can find them ... maybe you can hire ... the a team .
murdock , relax .
you" re gettin " fidgety .
this is unit 24 . just spotted suspects ' van going east .
suspects have spotted me .
am in pursuit .
attention all units .
suspects have been seen on highway 15 heading east in a black van with red trim .
mobilize all local , county and state units .
advise caution .
this is hamilton county sheriff .
we are in pursuit to the county line .
we read you , hamilton county .
we" il take it from there .
step on it , b. a.
the local heat" s closing in .
head for the construction site .
xray 1 is out of the chase .
b. a. , will you make up your mind ?
which way you goin " ?
shut up , you crazy fool .
all units stand by .
no offence , colonel , but wasn" t that a little risky ?
maybe .
but we can" t be late for ray" s funeral .
he was too good a friend .
keep your eyes wide , guys .
we still got a long way to go .
come on .
lynch has almost caught us twice already .
once in arizona ...
and then again driving through texas .
that wasn' t even close in texas .
the point is he has an idea which direction we' re travelling .
now , since we don" t want to be chased out of barlow creek ... at least for a couple of days ...
i think maybe we should try and be extra cautious .
i know how hard it is for you guys to stay out of trouble .
trouble ?
i don' t start no trouble .
i mind my own business .
going up to a traffic cop ... who is writing out a ticket for your van and eating the citation right in front of his face ... absolutely falls under starting trouble .
well , you gotta admit ... the look on that cop' s face was worth it .
all right , all right .
we all agree not to eat any more parking tickets .
all this talk about food has made me hungry .
murdock , we were talking about eating parking tickets .
well , to a human garbage disposal anything' s appetizing .
uh , uh , b. a. ?
let him go , man .
gotta get some gas .
yeah , we' ve gotta get directions to the cemetery too .
we' il meet you back here .
funerals tend to ruin my appetite .
i' il be with you in a minute .
just go ahead and , uh , sit anywhere .
we' ve got some terrific specials today .
sounds great .
i haven' t told you what they were .
ah , you don' t have to .
looks like he got his appetite back , huh ?
in full force .
yeah , i ...
i started to feel a little weak .
well , that' s a pretty wild looking truck you got there , mister .
you sure ain' t from around here , are you , huh ?
no , you sure ain' t from around here .
no , you ain' t from around here .
no , you ain' t from around here .
well , do you have a cemetery around here ?
a cemetery ?
hey , have we got a cemetery .
the fact is people' s dyin ' to get in there .
you get it ?
you see , " dying " ?
you know , dyin ' to get in .
i' il bet johnny carson' s holding his breath waiting for you to drop out of the sky ... but could you tell us where the cemetery is so we won' t be late ?
late ?
for what ?
ain' t no one being buried out there today exceptin ' ray brenner ... and no one' s allowed to go to that funeral .
why is no one allowed , harold ?
' cause the watkins said so .
who ?
oh , you surely are from way off .
the watkins .
me and deke and logan and c. w.
we all says you can' t go to the cemetery .
ray brenner' s funeral is exactly where we' re going .
we can discuss this at greater depth when i get back .
then , i' m not gonna ...
i' m not gonna fill you up to go out ...
do you know what you' re doin ' ?
you know what logan' s gonna do when he finds out about this ?
he' s ...
do ya ?
huh ?
he' s gonna make you pay .
well , that' s good .
because when it comes to paying up , i' ve got a great line of credit .
what was all that about ?
that guy' s crazier than murdock .
beats me , b. a.
this is the last piece .
i hope it' s still fresh .
l" m gonna be making up a new batch this evening , so maybe if you" re gonna be around later ...
i' il definitely be around .
i' m in town for a friend' s funeral .
oh , you' re friends of ray' s ?
yeah , we were in vietnam together .
well , tell trish that i' m sorry .
dad and i won' t be coming .
you know the brenners well ?
yeah .
i' m doing an article on how small american towns honour their war heroes .
lianne , got people" s food getting cold .
okay , dad .
## [ singing ]
oh , lianne .
hey , uh , you' re sittin ' in my stool .
are you kidding ?
no , that' s ... that' s my stool .
i sit there all the time .
oh , yeah ?
remember ray' s funeral .
yeah , but , uh ...
but what ?
but what , pally ?
huh ?
oh , not you , gorgeous .
gorgeous , sit down .
you know , you' re so flattering , i almost can' t stand it .
you' re kind of cute yourself .
how' s the , uh , soup , c. w. ?
oh , it needed a little salt .
how much do we owe you ?
you don' t owe nothin ' .
you didn' t eat nothin ' .
why don' t you have a little pie ?
lianne here makes some of the best pie in the county .
we' re all out of pie , deke .
you' re out of pie today ?
hey , have some of mine .
come on .
that does it .
oh , yeah ?
what , you got a problem ?
yeah , a medium sized one .
oh , yeah ?
okay , let' s go , guys .
come here .
i didn' t ...
ow !
so you got a little problem here , huh ?
there' s no problem ... no problem at all .
ah , keep your stinkin ' pie anyway .
we don' t want any trouble , so unless you want me to call the cops , you and your friends will get out .
what are you talking to us for ?
what' d we do ?
look , uh , i don' t want trouble , okay ?
uh , no trouble .
so , go .
please go .
i don' t understand any of this .
what are you kicking us out for ?
you going to ray' s funeral ?
that' s right .
would you tell trish i' m sorry ?
i' m real sorry .
why don' t you tell her yourself ?
no .
no , i can' t .
uh , they' il be watching .
the watkins ?
it' s about time that somebody does somethin ' about those mangy animals .
who ?
that rum soaked excuse for the law ?
the story i sold my editor on doesn' t exactly look like it' s going to come together .
what in the world is going on here ?
i don' t know , but if you want to avoid trouble , i don' t think this is the town to do it in .
we are not here to pay our respects to just a man ... but to spend one last moment with a friend ... a friend who ... who had something special .
someone who brought something to everyone who knew him .
raymond brenner rose up to take a stand for what he knew was right and just .
he wore courage and kindness like a badge of honour .
raymond may have moved on , and his wife , trish , and his friends will miss him dearly ... but the joy of his memories will live with us for the rest of our lives .
burying detail , attention , hut .
three steps forward .
ho !
forward , arms !
take aim .
burying detail ... fire !
fire !
fire !
order , arms !
the first time i tagged up with ray brenner ... he couldn" t have been more than two weeks out of special forces training .
the unit was on a search and destroy detail , had to blow up one of charlie" s supply bridges .
it got real hot ... but ray stood up like a guy born to do just that .
one time , charlie had the company pinned down .
it was my first firefight , and there was crying and screaming everywhere .
when i bailed out of thejeep and hit the dirt ...
i lost my helmet .
ray gave me his .
one night i was walking point and took a round in my leg .
i was bleedin " bad ... real bad .
then this white dude come up to me and dragged me over to the medevac .
ray brenner had a heart like i never seen .
there" s a difference between being brave ... and just crazy .
ray brenner was just brave .
he vectored me in through a hornet" s nest ... about a day from da nang ... and we pulled some grunts out of trouble .
my bird was the only one left in the sky .
knowing your trouble with the law and all , i still knew you' d be here .
i knew if you got my message in time , you' d all be here .
thank you for comin ' .
we had to come , trish .
well , do you have to be going back ?
i' d love for you to come by and see the place .
we have plenty of time .
good .
can i have a moment alone , please ?
of course .
i' il wait by the pickup and ride back with you .
thank you .
it' s been a long time .
yeah .
yeah .
he was a good man .
not much of a turnout for someone who was born and raised in this burg .
maybe trish can explain it .
well , put a hat on it , huh ?
b. a. , check your mirror .
looks like someone" s knocking on the back door .
hang on , brother !
huh !
get off , face .
you' re crushing my ...
what ?
hannibal .
guys , are you okay ?
yeah , we' re just in here staying out of trouble .
there it is .
easy , b. a.
i' m gonna get them guys .
i' m gonna make ' em pay for messing up my ride .
then you' il pay for 30 years in a federal prison .
you do remember lynch ?
i' il go talk to the sheriff .
the sheriff ?
since when have we gone to the law for help ?
first time for everything .
i' m gonna need that tow truck to get my van out of the ditch .
those guys broke my rear axle .
well , that' s fitting , isn' t it ?
the watkins brothers own the only service station in this county .
they don" t let anyone else in their territory .
all l" m gonna do is ask the sheriff to send somebody in from tustin .
you guys will wait right here .
no trouble , right ?
promise you' il wait .
promise .
oh , i knew i forgot something !
murdock , you comin " ?
but i did promise .
what' s a little white lie ?
look , i can' t go arrest people without proof .
i' m just tryin ' to sort out what you' re givin ' me .
that' s all .
so why don' t you just drive on out to the cemetery and look at the van with its side bashed in ?
comin ' out of the cemetery , huh ?
you know what happened , jeff .
it sounds to me like you don' t want to do anything at all .
look , trish .
you' re not gonna go swearing out complaints against the watkins ... not if you intend to stay around here .
listen , jeff .
listen to me .
these men who were run off were friends of ray' s .
they went overseas together .
do you understand me ?
yeah .
they' il handle this the same way ray would have .
do you want that to happen again ?
do ya ?
lord' s sake , jeff , they were just comin ' to my husband' s funeral .
believe me , they' re not looking for trouble .
ow !
what are you , crazy ?
what do you guys want ?
your tow truck drove my van off the road .
i want to know who was driving it .
is it clear now ?
it' s not me .
not me .
see , logan , he won' t let me take the trucks .
where are the rest of the brothers grimm ?
logan !
hey , logan !
where do you put the saddle ?
long way from an army base , aren' t ya ?
these here are friends of ray brenner' s .
why' d you run our van off the road ?
you know what they' re talkin ' about , harold ?
how about you , curly ?
they keep gettin ' bigger .
now , i told ' em how dangerous it was going on up the cemetery ... but they all had to learn just for themselves , didn" t ya ?
is there any particular reason that nobody was supposed to go to ray" s funeral ?
' cause i say so .
that' s reason enough around here .
hey , we have gasoline here .
sign says no smokin ' .
sorry .
are you nuts ?
man said he didn' t want me to smoke .
what do you think you' re doin ' ?
what about my van ?
you can file a complaint with the sheriff .
that' s what most people do .
we' re not most people .
uh ... what the ...
what' s goin ' on around here , logan ?
seems these fellas here have the idea we know something about a van they were driving .
yeah .
it was black , tinted windows , red detailing on the side .
just like that one right there .
hey , man , this is my van !
where' s my wheels ?
beats me .
say , sheriff .
how you doin ' , sweet cheeks ?
sheriff , why don' t you ask them what they' re doing with the van ?
well , we' re towin ' it in .
found it off the road up at cutter' s way .
you gotta be careful up there .
they got some dangerous curves .
uh huh .
so we heard .
aw , yeah , baby .
yeah , baby .
b. a. , it" s her .
she recognizes me .
they stole my radio !
that" s the way we found it , man .
we don' t have much vandalism around these parts , but up at cutter' s way .
hey , man .
you better fix my van .
we' d be more than happy to do something about it .
we can find a couple of tyres for the thing , maybe find a radio .
unless you' re looking for trouble from the law , you better keep real calm .
they" re not lookin " for trouble , sheriff .
they just came here to spend the day with me .
from what i can see , i' d say these fellas got every right to charge you for fixing your van .
thank you , sheriff .
now that' il be 50 bucks for the service charge ... and 25 bucks a mile for the tow .
just get it fixed .
we' il do our best .
that van better be in primo condition when we go back .
i cannot believe that even the sheriff is afraid of those creeps .
oh , poor jeff .
he was only a deputy when the last sheriff disappeared .
disappeared ?
yeah , he was in the woods up north and just never got back .
word was he may have gotten hurt and couldn" t call for help , but he was on his way to talk to the watkins .
of course , logan and his brothers say he never got there .
how can an entire town let them get away with something like that ?
because we know they' re crazy .
you don' t dare look at ' em wrong .
you can' t even charge ' em when they come in your store .
they can take anything they want from anyone .
i mean , who" s gonna stand up to" em ?
i' il bet ray did .
right .
and now he' s dead .
when he saw what the watkins were doing , it drove him crazy .
when he tried to say something , no one would back him up .
he couldn" t be one man against five .
i kept tellin " him that .
so he tried to look the other way .
then one day he heard ... that while i was in town deke had grabbed me while i was in the grocery store .
ray went berserk .
he followed him into town .
those bullet holes in the gas station wall .
yeah , he shot up the station .
then there was a fight .
he hurt him pretty bad .
the accident was the next day ... hit and run , no witnesses .
tsk .
oh , lord .
take it easy , trish .
trish , i' d like to borrow your pickup .
not unless you' re gonna use it to get out of barlow .
what happened to ray is enough .
sure is .
ray was one of the only men who stuck by us during the trial .
he was a friend , and friends always do for one another .
just because he' s gone , that don' t mean we don' t owe him .
what are you gonna do ?
well , pick up b. a. ' s van .
we gave ' em two hours .
i figure their time' s about up .
i' m here for my van .
yeah , well , logan ain' t here right now .
yeah , well , where is he ?
we said two hours .
it' s been two hours .
logan don" t go letting people tell him what he should and shouldn" t do .
maybe that' s logan' s problem .
look , you just don' t want to understand .
you don' t go messing with no watkins .
around here it" s watkins " law .
yes , sir .
go ask your widow friend .
she' il tell ya .
she already did .
hannibal .
yeah , well , let me tell you , if you come looking to get your butts handed to you ... you' ve come to the right place .
hannibal , allow me and murdock .
follow the yellow brick road .
lianne .
what are you gonna do , old man ?
dad , it' s okay .
i' m fine .
yeah , what' s your problem , pal ?
look , leave him alone , okay ?
that man" s just eatin ' .
let him finish .
yeah , well , he' s finished .
beat it .
hey .
relax .
lianne , i' il be back tonight .
don" t be expecting pretty boy .
you see , i got him out looking for some wheels .
well , well , well , well , well .
how' s it goin ' , deke ?
oh , great .
i asked you fellas not to come back here .
i just stopped by to remind lianne about our date tonight .
and i still want to try that delicious pie l" ve heard so much about .
these guys just don' t get the message .
oh , we get the message , all right .
don' t we get the message , murdock ?
i told you .
it needed a little more salt .
that' il take care of any damages .
i' il see you tonight .
we do good work .
we certainly do .
go see about my van .
we get 65 a mile and a hundred bucks service .
hey .
hey .
hey !
what do you want ?
i want that .
you better know i called curly and logan .
i called ' em .
they' re comin ' on ove ...
shut up !
they' re comin ' over here .
bring ' em over here .
now , where' s our stuff ?
now , have you had your 10, 000 mile checkup ?
no , they' re in there !
they' re in there !
well , well , well .
just like christmas .
okay , you guys stripped ' em .
put ' em back on .
move it !
yeah , baby .
yeah , baby .
see , i told you we " d come back .
hannibal .
guess what' s missing .
looking for these ?
on your feet !
now it looks a whole lot better , don' t it ?
well , it surely does !
it surely does !
keep your heads down .
get up .
you guys come back into our town and you" re dead .
let' s go , c. w.
by the way , deke and harold are gonna take care of your girlfriend .
it' s those maniacs .
amy , what are we gonna do ?
anything we can to keep those creeps from getting their hands on us .
why don' t i pay more attention when the guys do this ?
here .
let me .
oh , it' s empty .
do you have any bullets ?
ray must have ... someplace .
okay , go get ' em and check every window , trish .
got it .
i' m here , darlin ' !
your first prize !
l" m all yours , sweetie !
hey , now .
come on .
open up .
now your boyfriends have gone and run off .
so it' s just us , darlin ' .
just the two of us !
hey !
open up !
i' m gonna go check out the side .
come on !
the next one ain' t gonna get by .
darlin ' !
open up !
get outta here !
open this stinkin ' door !
deke !
deke !
she burned out my eyes !
kill her !
i wanna get out of here !
no way !
people are gonna take advantage if you don' t stand up for what you think is right .
it doesn' t pay to sit back ...
what is this ?
whoa .
hey .
whoa .
this is a beautiful automobile .
please , sir .
we need your car .
i' m awfully sorry , ma' am .
we have to take your car .
here' s $450 .
we' il take real good care of it .
arnold , say something .
we' il bring it back as good as new .
well , how long you gonna keep it ?
we' il send a cab for you right away .
where are they going ?
i don" t know .
don' t worry .
amy , hold these .
come on , baby !
open up !
open up the door , baby !
i' ve got a gun !
open up .
whoo ! lt" s party time , girls !
let us in .
get under that desk .
i' m warning you !
i' ve got a gun !
you hear that , deke ?
she' s got a gun .
bull !
oh !
this chick is nuts !
it' s empty !
here comes their crazy friends .
well , it' s time to leave .
come on .
i' m gonna fire .
amy , you all right ?
it' s them .
face ?
oh , guys .
you got any more ammo ?
it" s all over the place .
empty .
trish , does that tractor out in the yard work ?
i think so .
i' il check it out .
are you gonna go after ' em ?
we tried staying out of trouble .
it didn' t seem to work for us .
listen , amy , there' s a car outside .
take it to a nice , little old couple ...
who should be waiting for you on route 4 , near the barlow turn off .
trish , where' s the rest ?
the rest ?
yeah .
ray always kept weapons .
and those bullet holes in that gas station came from automatic fire .
in the bedroom closet .
the keys are on the dresser .
they probably just come back for the girl .
let' s take a ride out there and see .
hey , dirtballs !
yo , curly , c. w. , the guns .
well , you boys got an awful lot of stupid in ya .
i got a thing about living with cockroaches .
my friends and i are gonna do some exterminating .
you should have left town while you had the chance .
that was our next line .
especially since you guys aren' t gonna have anyplace to hang out any more .
we' re the neighbourhood beautification committee .
we clean up neighbourhoods .
what are you talking about ?
you forgot to check the oil .
harold , get back here !
harold ?
drop ' em , or i' il cut ya in half !
i need some volunteer deputies .
get over here .
sheriff , deputize ' em .
uh , you guys are hereby deputized .
good .
and here' s some dried blood ... scraped off of the front bumper of their tow truck .
have it analysed .
i' m sure it' il be ray brenner' s type .
yeah .
put ' em away .
okay , let' s take ' em in , boys .
hey .
oh , come on , b. a. it' s not so bad .
you had to rotate these tyres anyway .
hey , man , why you always trying your crazy logic on me when bad things keep happening to us ?
every cloud has a silver lining .
when the going gets tough , the tough get going .
shut up , murdock !
shut up !
# if you want to dance to the music #
# you got to pay the piper ##
how do you like this one ?
dead men tell no tales .
oh , yeah .
i' m gonna go talk to hannibal .
you know , hannibal , i think you made a mistake .
you should have sprayed those guys purple .
you know , billy always turns purple just before he gets mad .
you should have sprayed ' em yellow because they' re cowards .
considering where they' re going , i think stripes would be appropriate .
you gotta admit , fellas .
they do stand out .
now , trish , you sure you' re gonna be all right ?
this is a pretty big place for a woman alone .
i' m gonna be fine .
i can afford to hire somebody .
with the watkins brothers behind bars , maybe i can make this the kind of farm ray always wanted .
anyhow , i got help on the way .
and remember , ray has many friends who will remember him .
