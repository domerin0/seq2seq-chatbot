good morning , ladies and gentlemen !
this train , originating from new york' s grand central station , is back in service !
next stop will be new canaan , connecticut .
new canaan , connecticut , next stop .
it was a typical predicament for the fantastic four ... because they weren' t like other superheroes ; they were more like a family .
and the more power they had , the more harm they could do to each other ... without even knowing it .
that was the meaning of the fantastic four : that a family is like your own personal antimatter .
your family is the void you emerge from and the place you return to when you die .
and that' s the paradox : the closer you' re drawn back in , the deeper into the void you go .
the dilemma dostoyevsky claims here to have discovered ... goes to the very core of christianity' s relationship to the modern world .
but it is a dilemma that yes , libbets .
but dostoyevsky is saying here is that ... to be a christian is to choose , because you have to choose of your own choice .
and since you can' t choose to be good ... because that' d be too rational , you have to choose to be bad .
it' s existential .
thank you , libbets .
that' s a very compelling summary .
but , of course , existentialism , per se
libbets ?
hey ,
dostoyevsky i' m also really a fan .
and , uh , what you were saying , you know
have you ever read the ldiot ?
the ldiot ?
if you liked notes from underground , you' il love the ldiot .
great .
thanks for the tip .
the ldiot !
i' m in love with libbets casey .
oh , come on .
she' s a poor little rich girl .
check out the jeans and fur look .
and get a load of this : like , her mom and stepdad and stepsisters ... are going to switzerland to ski over thanksgiving break and they didn' t invite her .
how do you know this shit ?
they did it last year too .
it' s traditional or something .
they' ve got this humongoid place in new york and she just holes up there with a wad of cash .
you think francis is going to beat me to the punch here ?
since he sleeps with every girl you ever show an interest in , why don' t you just keep your libbets fixation a secret from him ?
you already told him .
i hope you changed the water in that bong from last night .
the water , as you call it , is a special mixture of amaretto and brandy ... blended for just the exact chemical interaction ... with the last of our precious thai stick .
give me your dirty love [ continues ]
oh whoa whoa !
waste not , master hood .
that was 20 for the bag .
oh .
i' ve been thinkin ' , francis .
you know , you are one drug addled elitist freak .
and when the revolution comes i do not want to be lined up with you and shot ... because you are fuckin ' ripe for political reeducation
you know , like in the fields .
let me enlighten you about something here .
you and i exist on two opposite sides of a great existential divide , that being your pathetic virginity on the one hand ... and my astonishing number of sexual conquests on the other .
you' re simply jealous .
hood , telephone .
with your erogenous zones lubricated with the mighty herb , beware out there because you drone on like a motherfucker when you' re stoned .
flame on , asshole .
hello ?
paul ?
oh , hi , dad .
hey , guy .
how' s it goin ' ?
everything all right up there ?
yeah , everything' s good .
well , good .
i' m just confirming you' il be on the 4 : 40 on wednesday , right ?
i' m gonna come thursday .
well , you can' t come on thursday , paul , because thursday' s already thanksgiving .
well , that' s the whole point of the holidays , paul , so you and your sister can mope around the house and your mother and i can ... wait on you hand and foot while the two of you occasionally grunt for more food ... from behind the hair in your faces .
believe it or not we actually enjoy it .
okay , okay , dad .
good .
thanks , guy .
hang on a second .
wendy , you want to say " hi " to your brother ?
wendy , come on !
... we should get the facts out first .
charles .
charles .
have you been keeping out of my shit ?
have you refrained from entering the sacred precincts of my room ?
i haven' t touched your sh stuff .
are you watching this ?
watching what ?
nixon , doofus .
it' s incredible .
he should be shot .
hey , drop the political assassination stuff , please .
he' s a liar .
dean told him on march 21 about kalmback and hunt , all about the payoffs to the watergate burglars , so you tell me where the so called " dean report " is .
but you can' t , because it doesn' t exist .
all right .
the defence rests .
you want another ?
no , thank you .
we should be off .
gotcha .
... knows that when the march 24 tape  charles ?
charles , calm down .
i wasn' t in on it .
it' s gonna sink , and the entire country will fall into anarchy ,
and the symbionese liberation army  dinner' s on the counter .
we' il be at the carvers ' .
you know the number .
paul , hi .
hi .
hi .
is there anything special you want , any particular kind of food we can stock up on ?
nope .
no ?
you' re all right ?
yeah , i' m i' m good .
yeah ?
okay , all right , we' il see ya next week .
i love you .
um , me too .
all right .
bye bye .
all right , wendy .
we' il see you later .
asleep by 10 : 00 .
i mean it , young lady .
as a matter of fact , i have a practice , whenever i' m not too tired at night , of dictating my own recollections of the day .
i think that , perhaps , will be the more accurate record of history in the end .
the dog jumps up and barks
it was a benefit for the aclu or something .
harry reems himself was there .
the man with the fr from deep throat ?
the very one .
classic .
something about a first amendment defence fund .
ted took me to see it .
oh , ted .
how romantic .
hmm .
you know , i have to admit the movie didn' t do much for me .
but being in that theatre , surrounded by all those horny young college boys and perverts ,
i mean , there was something in the air that
oh !
i' m sorry !
jeez !
oh , i' m sorry .
no , no , no .
no problemo , mikey .
it' s okay , mikey .
no problem .
put the wine down .
just leave the wine on the table .
go on into the kitchen .
it' s fine .
it' s fine .
sandy , help your brother out .
it' s nothing .
it' s fine .
thanks .
we changed our couples group .
now we' re in some geriatric group , though i must admit there are a couple of lookers .
but you two are still sticking it out with dr pasmier ?
oh , actually , ben decided that well , i mean we both decided
i just don' t see what the appeal is .
i mean , like ted said , people go in there and just get themselves all worked up
and that' s the point .
then go home and make up .
but elena and i , we don' t , uh , go in for those sort of histrionics .
about the only big fight we' ve had in years was about whether to go back into couples therapy .
it appears you won .
oh , please don' t .
it' s no bother .
i insist .
don' t touch them .
oh .
it' s really quite all right .
of course .
and to think they met at a key party of all things .
a key party ?
oh , you know .
it' s a california thing .
that scuzzy husband of hers ... dragged her kicking and screaming to one when they were out in l. a.
you know , the men put their car keys in a bowl , and at the end of the evening the women line up and fish them out ... and whoever' s they' ve got they go home with .
anyhow , that' s how she met this rod person or whatever his name is .
he' s left his wife , she' s packing for california and lrwin is devastated .
it' s so ironic .
ironic ?
well , yes , ironic .
his name' s rod .
no , come on .
he' s like a big , infected whitehead .
i would never
shit .
it' s my parents .
he' s so gross .
my drumstick was still frozen when you , you know , cut inside there .
probably gonna get whatever that disease
i knew it .
watch this .
dad , stop it !
get to sleep , young lady .
i mean it !
fascist .
if i were a fascist ...
i would have sent you to one of those southern military academies a long time ago .
now , get to bed !
hey !
hey , kiddo .
sleep well , huh ?
good night , dad .
ben .
... reduce its cash position , especially during this period of inflation .
elena ?
elena hood , am i right ?
yes .
reverend edwards .
philip edwards .
you came by ...
and checked out the congregation a couple of times last year .
oh , yes .
it was , um oh , i ended up
oh , no need to make excuses .
we' re not for everyone , i know .
but , um , i did think for a time that you might be someone who
well , what i mean is that you didn' t seem to think what we were trying to do is laughable ,
iike some of your fellow citizens around hereabouts .
no , no .
i didn' t think it laughable at all .
perhaps you find in books what i try to find in people .
that sounds vaguely like an insult .
oh ... my , i' m sorry .
i didn' t mean it that way at all .
perhaps i meant it simply as a , a provocation .
she' s a total young republican .
she said you licked dave brewster' s weenie in the 3rd floor bathroom .
she' s lying .
i wouldn' t touch dave brewster' s dick if you paid me .
it' s probably crawling with v. d. from when he stuck it in her ,
which he did .
donna said that her brother and all his stupid friends were talking about [ boys shouting ]
mikey !
stoner !
i suppose my reluctance was ... the group aspect of it ; i' ve never been much of a joiner , although i still consider myself a somewhat religious person .
well , i , of course , flatter myself that our church is not exactly ... what most people would call organized religion .
at times , it' s the disorganization that' s liberating .
and , of course , i' ve begun to minister much more in what one might call ... therapeutic environments in small groups and couples and , uh , one on one .
my daughter .
i haven' t been on a bike for years .
when was the last time you rode a bike ?
they say you never forget .
hi , wendy .
hey , sandy .
mikey was looking for you .
oh , yeah ?
see ya .
want some gum ?
devil dog ?
chewing .
did you tell sandy ?
tell sandy what ?
you didn' t tell him either , did you ?
we were golfing .
and golfing , to me , is something i' m supposed to enjoy and i was on the goddam golf team in college , so it' s something one would assume i do well i used to do well .
but basically , these days , golfing for me is like hoeing or plowing .
it' s like farming .
and george clair ...
has obviously in the mere two years he' s been with the firm he' s obviously been taking secret lessons with a golf pro .
i bet the entirety of his disposable income has been dedicated ... to humiliating me on the golf course .
and that guy talks nonstop throughout the entirety of the miserable 18 holes ...
ben . on topics that are the supposed domain of my department .
ben .
yeah ?
you' re boring me .
i have a husband .
i don' t particularly feel the need for another .
you have a point there .
that' s a very good point .
we' re having an affair .
right .
an explicitly sexual relationship .
your needs , my needs .
you' re absolutely right .
you better get dressed .
the boys' il be home soon .
gotcha .
hi , mom .
hi , wendy .
it' s funny .
when i was in town i saw you on your bike .
with mikey ?
who ?
nobody .
mikey carver ?
oh , we were just riding around .
well , you looked very free when i saw you , as if i were seeing my own memories of being a girl .
there was something internal about it .
mom , are you okay ?
of course , wendy .
i' m sorry .
you must think i' m ripe to be checked into silver meadows .
you' re not a psycho .
people at silver meadows aren' t psychos .
i know .
they' re rich drug addicts and celebrities .
they need the money at school for my band uniform .
i thought you quit the band .
i never hear you practise any more .
yeah , well , i don' t really need to practise .
i just play a few notes , anyway , so i figured i' d just stay in .
well , i' m sure your father and i would love to hear what you' re playing these days .
maybe after dinner ?
the halfords have invited us again this year .
do you want to go ?
mmm .
what do you think ?
well , it' s a neighbourhood tradition .
i' m , uh , gonna go to bed .
so early ?
mmm .
rough day .
good night .
is that a new aftershave ?
uh , yeah .
uh , musk or something .
you like it ?
mmm .
good night .
good night .
hey , mikey ?
yeah ?
geometry ?
sure .
anything but this english .
how come you' re so good at math but not at english ?
i' m not good at math , i' m just good at geometry .
it' s like , you know when they say " two squared , " you think it means two times two equals four , but they really mean a square it' s really space .
it' s not numbers , it' s space , and it' s perfect space , but only in your head ' cause you can' t draw a perfect square in the material world , but in your mind you can have perfect space .
you know ?
yeah .
but i just need some help with my homework .
hey , guys .
i' m back .
you were gone ?
yeah , mikey .
yup .
i was in houston working on some great new ideas about silicon .
it comes from sand .
it' s a semiconductor .
so , how you guys doin ' ?
how' s school ?
um , i don' t know .
okay , i guess .
mmm .
all right .
good trip ?
you bet .
jim .
jesus .
oh .
i' m sorry .
hell , we gotta trade this thing in for a normal bed .
just be careful .
have you noticed anything with mikey lately ?
the kid seemed a little out of it tonight , huh ?
tonight ?
mikey' s been out of it since he was born .
guess the kid takes after me , huh ?
molecules .
because of molecules we are connected to the outside world from our bodies .
like when you smell things .
because when you smell a smell it' s not really a smell , it' s part of the object that has come off of it molecules .
so when you smell something bad it' s like , in a way , you' re eating it .
this is why you should not really smell things ... in the same way you don' t eat everything in the world around you ... because , as a smell , it gets inside of you .
so , the next time you go into the bathroom after someone else has been there , remember what kind of molecules you are , in fact , eating .
mrs hood ?
mrs hood , did you forget something ?
no .
uh , wh why don' t you just come on in here .
i think maybe you forgot something .
to find yourself in the negative zone , as the fantastic four often do , means that all everyday assumptions are inverted .
even the lnvisible girl herself becomes visible ... and so she loses the last semblance of her power .
it seems to me that everyone exists partially on a negative zone level some people more than others .
in your life it' s kind of like you dip in and out of it : the place where things don' t quite work out the way they should .
but for some people , there' s something about the negative zone that tempts them , and they end up going in going in all the way .
sandy !
you idiotic little dope !
you could blow yourself fucking sky high with this demented crap !
hey .
hey .
i' il take this .
you' re not gonna tell dad , are you ?
would it matter ?
what' s this ?
you know , it' s the whip the one uncle frank got me from mexico .
it' s not packed with explosives , is it ?
no .
play with the whip .
you turned them all down , didn' t you ?
well , i didn' t love them .
isn' t it a fact that you turned them down because these men wanted
hi , wendy .
hi , mrs carver .
mikey , have you heard the explosions coming from the back yard ?
i don' t know .
do you know what your brother' s been up to ?
i don' t know . ... a secret intention not to want children ?
that' s not true !
didn' t you
no , sir .
i want children very much and so does bill .
then , when that happened , you went to another doctor and got a prescription .
no , that is not true .
excuse me .
don' t you kids have homework ?
thanksgiving break .
if you deny that , we have a witness in the courtroom , another druggist .
take a look .
you' re under oath .
all right , i did .
is it a crime ?
no wonder the police can' t find out how the gang is transporting the stuff .
they' re using milk trucks .
they' re leaving .
return the scanner and follow the truck .
oh .
after you .
no , you can
hey , sandy , what were you blowing up out there ?
your mom seemed pretty p. o. ' d .
all my model planes .
the ones you built ?
yeah .
they were getting old .
they couldn' t fly anyhow .
i' m gonna get a radio controlled aeroplane for christmas .
i' m gonna stuff it full of m 80s and fly it into mrs burgess ' class and blow it up .
well , i have to go to the bathroom .
i' il show you mine if you show me yours .
what do you want ?
what do you want ?
get out of here !
get out !
what' s going on here ?
wendy , a person' s body is his temple .
this body is your first and last possession .
now , as your own parents have probably told you , in adolescence our bodies tend to betray us .
that' s why in samoa and other developing nations ... adolescents are sent out into the woods , unarmed , and they don' t come back till they' ve learned a thing or two .
do you understand ?
i don' t ever want to see you .
then why' d you come after me ?
elena , can you give me a hand here ?
oh !
i' m trying to get this turkey defrosted before tomorrow .
whoop !
there .
got it ?
can you take this ?
oop !
here .
you all right there ?
oh , sure .
i' m
um , did you remember to pick up the cranberry sauce ?
uh , yes .
yes .
because , uh , you like it on your turkey sandwiches .
i do .
i' m are are you
i i don' t know .
i think i , uh
elenie , you know  ben
i' ve been thinking  ben , maybe no talking right now .
if you start talking you' re going to
i' m going to pick up paul at the station .
want to come ?
no .
what you been up to ?
nothing .
so how' s school treating you ?
it' s good .
classes ?
fine .
grades ?
all right .
anyone special ?
you know  huh uh .
well , it' s good to see ya .
we miss you around the house and all .
but this , uh , this st. peters it' s top of the line , eh ?
oh , yeah .
you know , paul , i was thinking this may be as good a time as any ... to have a little talk ... about , um
well , uh  about ?
well , the whole gamut , uh , facts of life .
' cause i tell ya there' s things happening that you' re probably old enough to digest .
things .
well , things that happen between a
well , um , on the self abuse front and this is important , uh
i don' t think it' s advisable to do it in the shower .
it wastes water and electricity and because we expect you to be doing it there in any case .
and not on , uh , onto the linen .
oh , anyway , if you' re worried about anything at all ... just feel free to ask , and , uh , we' il look it up .
dad , you know i' m 16 .
all the more reason to be having this little heart to heart .
uh , [ elena ]
hi !
paul , uh , i was wondering , could you do me a favour and pretend i never said any of that ?
sure , dad .
thanks .
hi !
how are you ?
hello .
movin ' ahead so life won' t pass me by [ continues ]
hello , charles .
greetings , charles .
how are the parental units functioning these days ?
dad' s doing his " up with people " routine ; mom really hasn' t been saying much .
i don' t know .
dad seems a little weird .
you know , nervous ?
yeah , well , wait till mom finally opens her mouth .
and i' m gonna go there free
do you think they' re headed for , like , the dustbin of history : divorce court ?
well , they dropped out of their couples group therapy thing .
is that good or bad ?
they can change their minds but they can' t change me
may i operate the telephonic apparatus ?
why don' t you use the one downstairs ?
well , i' m calling an individual , charles , in new york , confirming a social outing for friday night .
can i come ?
well , it' s a one on one kind of date thing .
with who ?
her name' s libbets .
libbets " ?
what kind of a name is " libbets " ?
is that my record ?
no .
you have messed with my shit , charles .
well , it' s great that we can all be together .
and this thanksgiving , no , uh , yelling , no hysteria , especially with your grandpa not here although we miss him .
so let' s do it right .
wendy , why don' t you say grace ?
you used to love to say grace , remember ?
dear lord , thank you for this thanksgiving holiday ... and for all the material possessions we have and enjoy ...
and for letting us white people kill the lndians and steal ...
wendy . their tribal lands and stuff ourselves like pigs ...
okay .
okay . even though children in asia are being napalmed  jesus !
enough !
all right !
paul , roll ?
thank you .
can i have the gravy ?
uh huh .
thanks .
you having one ?
in a bit .
you know , i think elena might suspect something .
maybe it' s all for the better , you know ?
yesterday at dinner , she well , she didn' t say anything .
has she acted funny to you ?
i mean , have you ...
noticed anything ?
have i noticed anything ?
mmm .
i' m not married to her , benjamin ; you are .
i think you' ve probably a better vantage point from which to observe her .
yeah , but , uh , i' ve been working a lot lately , and
no , that' s not it .
i guess maybe we' re just on the verge of saying something saying something to each other .
on the verge .
i' il be back .
hmm ?
birth control .
right .
gotcha .
janey ?
no one' s here .
we can just watch tv .
maybe we can mess around , you know ?
only if you want to .
i don' t know .
why did you with sandy ?
i don' t know .
do you like him ?
he worships you .
what' s that ?
oh , wow !
wendy .
i won' t take my pants off .
i' il touch it , but that' s as far as it goes .
when worlds collide .
what ?
4 : 30 movie , when worlds collide .
what the hell are you kids doing down here ?
what do you think we' re doing , dad ?
what do i think ?
i think you' re probably touching each other .
i think you' re touching that reckless jerk off , for god' s sake , and i think he' s trying to get into your slacks .
i think at 14 years of age you' re getting ready to give up your girlhood !
hey , hang on there , mr hood .
don' t you direct a single word at me , mikey .
i don' t want to hear it .
i' il be discussing this matter with your parents very soon .
young lady  talking to me , dad ?
who else would i be talking to ?
and take that thing off !
then forget all the stern dad stuff .
i' m not interested in your smart remarks right now , young lady .
let' s go , right now !
you and i can discuss it on the walk home .
look , kiddo , don' t worry about it .
i really don' t care that much .
i' m just not sure he' s right for you is all .
huh ?
it' s just , you develop a sense , when you' re older , if things are gonna work out or if they won' t .
and sometimes it' s not worth the mess .
your toes cold ?
come on .
i' il carry you .
hey , should i dress for the halfords now , or , uh give me your
it' s up to you .
i' d like to go early and leave pretty soon after that .
i get you , loud and clear .
hey , you look nice .
thanks .
so , where' ve you two been ?
you' il never guess where i found her .
you found her ?
in the basement at janey and jim' s with that weirdo , mikey .
not even a tv on .
they' re on the floor , and he' s got his trousers undone though , thank goodness , she was still dressed .
well , i really let him have it , and wendy came home peacefully .
so , uh , what were you doing in the carvers ' basement , anyway ?
i was just dropping off a coffee cup ; jim left it last time he was over .
it was on the dash of the car .
you were , you know , reading .
i just wanted to catch some air .
oh , yeah , right , right .
the mustache coffee cup , the one sitting on the dash .
yeah , that one .
that one .
see ya .
stay out of trouble .
you' il be on the 10 : 30 train ?
11 : 30 .
paul  oh , let the guy have some fun .
what' s the name of this girl with the fancy new york address ?
libbets .
libbets casey .
libbets " ?
what sort of name is " libbets " ?
just get a taxi home from the station tonight .
it' s supposed to storm .
okay .
bye .
bye .
... in its inquiry on thursday .
and that ends tonight' s coverage of the watergate affair .
oh , shoot .
in other news , outside  ... a few snow showers which quickly turn to light rain .
unless that rain comes down even harder tonight , accompanied by decreasing temperatures ... getting down to around freezing by midnight .
drivers in particular , beware it' s gonna get awfully icy on those roads .
we have a severe weather warning  what' s for dessert ?
see for yourself .
no advice from the experts , eh ? ... flood warnings in parts of southern connecticut and the jersey shore .
let' s go to our weather map now for the grim details .
a line of showers now located across central new jersey is sweeping our way ... and is expected to arrive in our area within the hour .
look , um  don' t start .
do you do you do you think l  i have no idea .
well , what' s on your mind ?
i mean , you
it wouldn' t make for a pleasant evening , if that' s what you' re after .
i don' t want to talk about it .
stupid mustache cup .
what do you mean ?
don' t be dim .
i know you think i' m so dense .
you think i' m so dense ... that now you want to be seen with your dense wife at the cocktail party .
and you want me to shake hands with your friends and make conversation ... and you' re not going to accord me the respect of talking honestly about this .
you don' t really know what this feels like .
i didn' t technically it' s not what you' re thinking , elena .
please have the decency to at least not tell me what i' m thinking .
oh , ben !
elena !
wonderful .
wonderful .
come in .
great to see ya .
ooh , i just got lipstick  that' s all right .
good to see you too .
would you care to play ?

oh , rob .
the , uh , stuffed tomatoes .
this just isn' t the best moment for this .
i know .
i know .
i had no idea
that this was going to be a key party ?
yeah .
well , if we' d understood , uh , we could' ve invented some sort of excuse .
a key party .
did you see how stuffed that bowl was already ?
well ?
i think we' re here , and we don' t have to stay .
we , uh , ought simply to put in an appearance , and then we can head home .
you have some marker , that' s what i think .
if you wanna know the truth , you have some marker .
and you' re gonna put it on the house keys so that janey can find it .
and then when i get back to the house , i' m gonna find the two of you in there , and wendy will be able to hear you , and paul will be back and he' il hear you .
and i' il catch you .
that' s what i think .
elena .
it' s not what you think .
it' s not some big plot .
honestly , l l
i don' t feel good about it .
i just
i don' t know .
well , i' m really pleased to hear a confession .
elena , you' re just getting wound up to get wound up .
listen , let' s just go to this fiasco .
if that' s what you want .
let' s just go on in .
i' d rather talk to anyone else but you .
my dear , he wrote her out of the will , and now her attorneys are , um
and this has been goin ' on for years her attorneys  [ elena ]

the molecules have stopped .
it' s clean .

they' re still in that bowl .
it doesn' t seem very safe leaving your car keys laying around .
let me .
thanks , but
oh , i don' t think so .
it' s been kind of a discouraging evening .
well , you couldn' t have hoped for much better when you came up the walk .
somehow , it seemed different in my imagination when i thought about it .
actually , i didn' t think about it at all really .
you want some coffee or something ?
elena , the fact that we' re neighbours [ sighs ]
close friends well , it makes all of this seem a little strange , don' t you think ?
my husband is probably passed out in the bathroom , or at least he wishes he were .
i' ve been married to him for 17 years and i have no intention ... of going in there to get him .
so , what i' m proposing is that ... since your wife went off with a boy and since you are here alone ,
i' m proposing that you and i do what makes sense .
stay warm , pass some time .
that' s all .
now don' t make me feel as if i' m being too forward .

easy does it .

you okay ?
yeah , yeah .
i' m all right .
whoo !
when you think about it , it' s not easy to keep from just wandering out of life .
it' s like someone' s always leaving the door open to the next world , and if you aren' t paying attention you could just walk through it , and then you' ve died .
that' s why in your dreams it' s like you' re standing in that doorway ... and the dying people and the newborn people pass by you ... and brush up against you as they come in and out of the world during the night .
you get spun around , and in the morning ... it takes a while to find your way back into the world .
phone' s out .
hope the pipes
well , why don' t you put on some dry socks .
uh , and there are some , uh , rain boots in the guest closet back there .
