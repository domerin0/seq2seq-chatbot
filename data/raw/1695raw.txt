no .
seems awful strange to me .
a man who made all of his money off of computers doesn' t want to have one in his house .
oh !
cool .
cool .
this is fascinating .
supposedly , you can use this to write a mystery novel ... or to solve a complicated crime .
if
don .
you all right ?
what ?
is something wrong ?
well , it' s probably nothing .
uh , a love letter from one of your lovely ladies .
something like that .
i' il read it to you .
dear don , sometimes life brings some strange surprises .
it' s been almost 20 years since we' ve seen each other ,
but now there' s something i need to tell you .
years ago , after our story ended ,
i discovered i was pregnant .
i decided to go through with the pregnancy , and i had a baby , a son .
your son .
i decided to raise him by myself because our time together ...
had come to a close .
my son is now almost 19 .
he' s somewhat shy and secretive , unlike you ,
but a sensitive , wonderful person .
a few days ago he left on a mysterious road trip ,
but i' m almost certain he' s searching for his father .
i' ve told him almost nothing about you ,
but he' s resourceful and imaginative .
anyway , if this is , in fact , your correct address , well , i just felt i should let you know .
there' s no signature ... and no return address .
hey , congratulations !
you' re a father .
uh , you' re really upset by this .
c can i see it ?
your address is handwritten , but printed .
red ink on pink paper .
typewriter .
<i>a red ribbon .
curious . </ i>
dear don , sometimes "
hmm .
damn .
this postmark is too faint to read .
that' s fucked up .
tsk tsk .
and you have no idea who this is from ?
nope .
none .
but from all i know , you are like , uh like don juan or something .
don juan .
i gotta go .
you want me to keep the letter for forensic evidence or ... clues ?
or don .

probably not .
anyway , you' ve never had trouble finding interesting females .
i mean , uh , that' s the way your life has been though .
right ?
you' re like , uh like don juan .
winston , please stop saying that .
hey .
about this letter i did examine the postmark under my microscope .
<i>and it is too faint to read, </ i> <i>but the stamp </ i> it' s got on it a woodpecker .
<i>what does that mean to you ? </ i>
<i>anything ? </ i>
well , what i think we should do ... is to narrow down the possibilities .
winston , this is probably someone playing a joke on me .
if not , then ... whatever .
it seems so unfair someone to write a letter like this ... and and and not sign it ?
don' t you want to know who is the mother of your son ?
my hypothetical son ?
no , winston .
<i>i don' t , okay ? </ i>
okay .
then we can just drop it .
<i>we can ? </ i>
we can , of course .
okay .
<i>good . </ i>
it' s dropped .
but then how can you ignore something like this ?
you need to treat this as a sign .
what kind of sign ?
<i>of the direction of your life . </ i>
of this present moment .
<i>you need to solve this mystery ... </ i> and find out which of your women it was that you impregnated with your semen 20 years ago .

it' s an odd story .
i' m getting into odd stories .
well , i was a very successful lawyer .
i had no life , though , outside my work , except for my dog , winston .
your dog' s named winston ?
<i>yes . </ i>
<i>but then he died ... </ i> suddenly .

i realized that i could hear animals speak to me .
i mean , i certainly hadn' t been aware of that before .
and i don' t read animals ' minds .
<i>but when they want</ i> <i>to communicate, </ i>
<i>i can hear them . </ i>
you know , like you and i are talking .
<i>but we don' t</ i> <i>read each other' s minds . </ i>
is he saying something ?
he says you have a hidden agenda .

yeah , i know you asked her a question .
now , listen .
i just don' t think it' s very sensitive of you ... comin ' out here to try to hurt penny' s feelings , you know , to get back at her or whatever .

that' s my report , sherlock .
the general outline of what you put me through .
that' s it ?
and after all that , you' re still no closer to knowing who' s the mother of your son ?
that' s right .
but there was that one typewriter .
and the pink motorcycle .
and it was dora' s pink , uh , business card .
and and and laura' s pink bathrobe .
i think this whole thing is a farce , a fiasco .
as far as i know , you may have written that letter to me .
look , i' m really sorry that you got beat up and everything .
l l l i feel that it was somehow my fault .
it was .
kind of strange , too , how , uh ,
carmen' s magic dog was named winston .
yeah [ stammers ]
look , man , i really put a lot of work into this thing .
i thought that it was really important that you know whether or not you had a son .
i mean , it' s your life .
you got to live your life , right ?
i <i>was</ i> living my life , winston .
i still am .
what' s this ?
it' s pink .
it' s a note i found in my foyer when i got back .
red ink on pink paper .
it' s from sherry .
what ?
from sherry ?
why didn' t you tell me ?
may i see it ?
envelope and paper not exactly the same size .
you know , the handwriting ... seems pretty close to the address on the envelope , but i can' t be sure .
sherry still likes you .
you think that sherry could have sent the first letter ... and made the whole thing up just to fuck with you ?
who knows ?
you know , i' ve got to go .
i think i have just enough time to stop home and compare the handwriting ... and then hopefully punch in at work on time .
you coming ?
no .
i just need a little break from all of this .
look , don' t worry .
we' re still going to solve this mystery .
didn' t i see you at the airport last night ?
i don' t know .
did you ?
yeah .
you on a road trip ?
yeah .
something like that .
you look hungry .
can i buy you a sandwich or something ?
uh , no , that' s okay .
you can relax .
i' m not gay .
i' m not a cop .
just a guy who sees a guy who might need a sandwich .
okay .
thanks .
but could you get something to go ?
i' d sorta rather stay outside .
sure .
how about a nice club sandwich ?
i' m vegetarian .
you eat cheese ?
yeah , sometimes .
l i like cheese .
okay , i got it .
i' il be right back .
<i>[ door opens , closes ] </ i>
thanks .
you' re welcome .
hey .
you found us a place .
all right .
let' s see here .
big cheese and veggie sandwich ... with mushrooms .
fries mmm .
extra large .
two waters .
two coffees .
my mom put that there ... <i>for good luck . </ i>
thanks for the food .
ahh .
no problem , chief .
you called me chief ?
yeah .
why ?
what happened to your eye ?
i , uh
i ran into somebody .
somebody' s fist .
you a gangster ?
no .
i wish .
no , i was , uh i was in computers .
computers and girls .
what about you , chief ?
i' m interested in , uh , philosophy .
philosophy and girls .
sounds pretty good .
think so ?
so , uh , as just a guy who gave another guy a sandwich , you have any , like , philosophical tips or anything ... for a guy on a kind of road trip ?
you asking me ?
yeah .
well
the past is gone .
i know that .
the future ... isn' t here yet , whatever it' s going to be .
so , all there is is is this .
the present .
that' s it .
are you a buddhist ?
no .
are you ?
uh , i' m not sure yet .
i' m sorry that' s the best i have to offer at the moment .
no , i appreciate it .
i like what you said .
it' s better than some , like , fatherly sounding bullshit .
is that ... what your father' s like ?
ah , that' s not a good subject .
hey , i gotta go , man .
i' m sorry .
thanks again for the sandwich and stuff .
hold on a second .
wait .
i know you think that i' m your father , don' t you ?
what ?
just tell me .
you can talk to me , chief .
man , you' re fucked up .
wait a second .
