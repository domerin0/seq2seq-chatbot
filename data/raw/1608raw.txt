we have the crew crossing gantry for capsule ingress .
roger that .
lnspired by the late president kennedy , in only seven years , america has risen to the challenge of what he called ...
the most hazardous and dangerous and greatest adventure ... on which man has ever embarked .
after trailing the russians for years with our manned space program ,
we got a short ! and after that sudden , horrible fire ... on the launchpad during a routine test ... that killed american astronauts gus grissom ,
ed white and roger chaffee , get us outta here ! there were serious doubts that we could beat the russians to the moon .
but tonight , a mere 18 months after the tragedy of apollo 1 , the entire world watched in awe as neil armstrong and buzz aldrin ...
landed on the moon .
the big news came just a moment ago .
mission control gave the spacecraft permission ... to go for the extravehicular activity that is , for the walk on the moon far earlier than anticipated , 9 : 00 p . m .
eastern daylight time .
the important thing when you' re penetrating the lunar module ... is your attitude and your relative speed .
let' s say this is me in the command module and this is you ,
all right . in the lem .
this thing sticks out .
that' s called a probe .
ls that true ?
absolutely .
and , tracey , when you feel that thing slide in , everything' s clickin ' , it' s like no other feeling in the world .
a little liquid propulsion .
what' s the big occasion ?
how' s it goin ' at mission control ?
it' s a nervous time .
they' re pacin ' around , smokin ' like chimneys .
gene kranz is gonna have puppies .
jim lovell .
hi .
this is tracey .
how do ya do , tracey ?
this is the man .
gemini 7 .
gemini 12 .
apollo 8 .
they were the first around the moon .
this guy did ten laps .
with one hand on the wheel .
make yourselves at home .
hey , marilyn .
where have you been ?
this is the last champagne in houston .
very good .
very good .
everything else all right ?
everything' s on course .
looks okay .
hey !
cadet lovell .
put this on ice .
make sure it gets cold .
you gonna get a haircut this summer ?
i' m on vacation .
oh , get a haircut .
well , hello there .
i wouldn' t mind bein ' up there tonight .
god , who wouldn' t .
don' t worry .
our day' s comin ' .
they' re not gonna cut the program before number 14 .
you know , my cousin called .
uh huh .
asked who we bribed to get on jim lovell' s crew .
i told him they wanted to make sure he got the best .
well , they got that right .
what network do we want ?
come on !
put on walter !
walter !
jules bergman !
john , turn it up ! ... has completed putting on the spacesuits and the boots .
i really appreciate you all coming to this dress rehearsal party ...
for my apollo 12 landing .
sit down , conrad .
i think we should all take a moment to recognize ... the exemplary hell , damn near heroic effort displayed by neil armstrong' s backup for this historic moon walk , and , of course , his crew .
let' s hear it for jim lovell , ken mattingly and fred haise .
there he is !
there he is !
everybody quiet down !
hey !
kids !
we had a good touchdown .
we can verify the position of the opening i ought to have on the camera .
what ?
you think it' s too late for him to abort ?
he still has time to get out .
he just needs somebody to wave him off .
pull up , neil !
pull up !
pull up !
okay , neil , we can see you coming down the ladder now .
look at those pictures .
wow .
i' m at the foot of the ladder .
the lem footpads are only depressed in the surface about , uh ... one or two inches .
it' s almost like a powder .
armstrong is on the moon .
neil armstrong , 38 year old american , standing on the surface of the moon ... on this july 20 , 1969 .
that' s one small step for man ... one giant leap for mankind .
his quote was ,
that' s one small step for man , one giant leap for mankind .
somewhere
beyond the sea
somewhere waitin ' for me
you' re drunk , lovell .
yeah .
i' m not used to the champagne .
me neither .
i can' t deal with cleaning up .
let' s sell the house .
all right , let' s sell the house .
they' re back inside now , lookin ' up at us .
lsn' t that somethin ' ?
i bet jannie armstrong doesn' t get a wink of sleep tonight .
when you were on the far side on 8 , i didn' t sleep at all .
i just vacuumed over and over again .
christopher columbus , charles lindbergh and neil armstrong .
neil armstrong .
from now on , we live in a world where man has walked on the moon .
it' s not a miracle .
we just decided to go .
on apollo 8 , we were so close , just 60 nautical miles down and
it was like i could just ... step out and walk on the face of it .
i want to go back there .
where' s my mountain ?
well , it up there .
it' s , uh , right up by the
it' s okay , do you see where the shadow crosses ... the white area there ?
that' s the sea of tranquility , and your mountain' s there , on the edge of that .
it' s your mountain .
your mountain , marilyn .
mount marilyn .
i don' t see it .
well , you gotta look harder .
you you you look harder ...
jim . while l
jim !
groovin '
down a crowded avenue
the astronaut is only the most visible member ... of a very large team , and all of us down to the guy sweeping the floor ... are honored to be a part of it .
what did the man say ?
give me a lever long enough and i' il move the world " ?
that' s what we' re doing here .
this is divine inspiration .
it' s the best part of each one of us , the belief that anything is possible .
things like a computer that can fit into a single room ... and hold millions of pieces of information , or the saturn 5 rocket .
this is the actual launch vehicle that will be taking alan shepard ... and his crew on the first leg of the apollo 13 mission .
when are you going up again , jim ?
i' m slated to be the commander of apollo 14 sometime late next year .
lf there is an apollo 14 .
jim , people in my state have been asking why we' re continuing ... to fund this program now that we' ve beaten the russians to the moon .
lmagine if christopher columbus had come back from the new world ... and no one returned in his footsteps .
attention , all personnel .
clear level three .
are there any other questions ?
how do you go to the bathroom in space ?
well , i tell you , it' s a highly technical process ... of cranking down the window and looking for a gas station , which
oh , there' s deke slayton .
deke , you might be able to answer this lady' s question .
deke is one of the original mercury seven astronauts , ladies and gentlemen .
now he' s our boss .
he hands out the astronauts ' flight assignments , so naturally we kick back part of our salaries to deke .
how much this month ?
can i have a minute ?
something' s come up .
sure , you uh , henry ?
hey !
anybody home ?
i' m not being a cheerleader , mom !
you don' t understand !
i worked so hard on this !
maybe i don' t understand , but you' re not wearing that out in this neighborhood .
she' s not even wearing a bra !
you can see everything !
shut up !
hey , everybody .
marilyn , trick or treat .
you know that easter vacation trip we had planned for acapulco ?
i was thinkin ' there might be a slight change in destination .
really ?
maybe , say ... the moon .
al shepard' s ear infection has flared up , and we' ve all been bumped up to the prime crew of apollo 13 .
straight to the head of the line and the fra mauro highlands .
six months ?
you' re moving up six months ?
dad , can i please wear this ?
sure .
jim .
no !
no .
absolutely not .
don' t you want somebody to love this stinks !
they' re not rushing things , are they ?
you' re gonna be ready in six months ?
we' il be ready .
i wouldn' t want to be around al shepard tonight .
i gotta get over there .
we' re gonna have to get up to speed .
go , go .
i' m gonna walk on the moon , marilyn .
i know .
i can' t believe it .
naturally , it' s 13 .
why 13 ?
it comes after 12 , hon .
apollo 13 , you are go for docking .
apollo 13 , you are go for docking .
all systems are nominal and on the line .
all systems are nominal and on the line .
okay , s 4b is stable , slot panels are drifting free .
the drogue is clear .
the docking target is clear .
i' m comin ' up on that now .
two ... one ... mark .
seventy five feet .
we' re comin ' up on docking .
let' s shut down some thrusters on ' em .
we' il see what he does .
whoa .
wait a minute .
i lost something here .
i can' t translate up .
houston , we are drifting down and away .
wanna back off and take another run ?
no , i got it .
let me just try and get it stable here .
i' m gonna reset the high gain .
i' ve got the target back in the reticle .
we' re stable .
go ahead and recycle the valves .
forty feet .
they' re all gray .
twenty .
easy .
ten feet .
capture .
that' s it !
that' s it .
sweet move , ken .
beautiful .
gentlemen , that is the way we do that .
man , that woke me up .
apollo 13 backup crew , you' re up in the simulator .
nice job , jim .
that' s three hours of boredom ... followed by seven seconds of sheer terror .
good job , guys .
you just won the christmas turkey .
nice try , frank .
you really outfoxed ' em , brother .
yeah , but it wasn' t perfect .
used up too much fuel .
you' re above the curve .
not by much .
listen , guys , i wanna work it again .
we gotta be up with the dawn patrol headed for bethpage , what , 0700 ?
wheels up at 0700 .
yeah , i know , but my rate of turn is still a little slow .
i really think we should work it again .
well , let' s get it right .
okay , set it up again , frank .
okay , 13 backup crew .
it' il have to wait .
prime crew' s up for another run .
yeah , baby .
apollo 13 , we show s 4b shutdown ... and all systems are nominal .
fred , set the s band omni to b , and when you get in the lem , two forward .
good shape over here .
hey , we got a problem .
ken , get your helmet on !
i can' t get it locked !
oh , god !
jim !
i thought the stars would fall down on you .
that' s silly .
stars can' t fall on us .
you' re a smarter kid than i was .
how long will it take to get to the moon ?
four days .
but that' s pretty fast .
see , this is the saturn 4b booster , and it shoots us away from the earth ... as fast as a bullet from a gun ... until the moon' s gravity actually grabs us and pulls us ... into a circle around the moon ... which is called an orbit .
all right ?
fred and i float down the tunnel into the lunar module , this spidery lookin ' guy .
only holds two people , and it' s just for landin ' on the moon .
and i take the controls and i steer it around ... and i fly it down , adjustin ' it here , the attitude there , pitch , roll ... for a nice , soft landing on the moon .
better than neil armstrong .
way better than pete conrad .
dad ... did you know the astronauts in the fire ?
yeah .
yeah , i did .
i knew the astronauts in the fire .
all of ' em .
could that happen again ?
well , i' il tell ya somethin ' about that fire .
um , a lot of things went wrong .
the , uh the door .
it' s called the hatch .
they couldn' t get it open when they needed to get out .
that was one thing .
and , uh
well , a lot of things went wrong in that fire .
did they fix it ?
oh , yes .
absolutely .
we fixed it .
it' s not a problem anymore .
i can' t believe they still have you doing public appearances .
well , henry hurt was ... all over me .
i know .
but with a training schedule this tight
well , it' s it' s the program , marilyn .
you know , it' s nasa .
hey !
hey , you' re jim lovell , aren' t ya ?
hey !
lucky 13 !
right on !
that' s the second time it' s done that .
i was looking at the kids ' school schedule coming up .
it' s a very busy week .
yeah .
i' m thinking about not going to the launch .
huh .
the kids need me at home , honey .
marilyn , we' ve had these kids for awhile now .
they' ve never kept you from comin ' to the other launches .
but now we have your mother .
she' s just had this stroke .
mom' s fine .
it' s not like i' ve never been to a launch .
the other wives have not done three .
i just don' t think i can go through all that .
i' il just be glad when this one' s over .
well , you' re gonna miss a hell of a show .
jim .
hey , guys .
see ya in a few weeks .
take care .
bring us back a moon rock .
so the number 13 doesn' t bother you .
so the number 13 doesn' t bother you .
only if it' s a friday , phil .
apollo 13 , lifting off at 1300 hours and 13 minutes ... and entering the moon' s gravity on april 13 ?
ken mattingly here has been doing some scientific experiments ... regarding that very phenomenon , haven' t you ?
uh , yes .
well , i had a black cat , uh , walk over a broken mirror ... under the lunar module ladder .
it didn' t seem to be a problem .
we' re considering a letter we got from a fella ... who said we oughta take a pig with us for good luck .
does it bother you that the public regards this flight as routine ?
there' s nothing routine about flying to the moon .
i can vouch for that .
and , uh , i think that an astronaut' s last mission his final flight that' s always going to be very special .
why is this your last , jim ?
i' m in command of the best ship ... with the best crew that anybody could ask for , and i' il be walking in a place where there' s 400 degrees difference ... between sunlight and shadow .
i can' t imagine , uh , ever topping that .
we have that scheduled for 0900 hours tomorrow .
that' s not gonna work , walter .
why ?
freddo and i are gonna be goin ' over the lunar surface experiments tomorrow ... and ken' s gonna be back in the simulator .
we' re gonna be goin ' over the flight plan tonight .
gonna pay a visit to this machine after you' re hard down .
thanks .
jim , we' ve got a problem .
we just got some blood work back from the lab .
charlie duke has the measles .
so we need a new backup .
you' ve all been exposed to it .
oh , i' ve had the measles .
ken mattingly hasn' t .
you wanna break up my crew two days before the launch ... when we can predict each other' s moves , read the tone of each other' s voices ?
ken mattingly will be getting seriously ill ... precisely when you and haise will be ascending from the lunar surface .
that' s a lousy time for a fever .
jack swigert has been out of the loop for weeks .
he' s fully qualified to fly this mission .
he' s a fine pilot , but when was the last time he was in a simulator ?
i' m sorry , jim .
i understand how you feel .
we can do one of two things .
we can scrub mattingly and go with swigert , or we can bump all three of you to a later mission .
i' ve trained for the fra mauro highlands , and this is flight surgeon horseshit , deke !
jim , if you hold out for ken , you will not be on apollo 13 .
it' s your decision .
oh , let it ring .
listen , l i gotta take that .
oh , why ?
because i' m on the backup crew , and the backup crew has to set up the guest list and book the hotel room .
swigert .
yeah .
i looked all around
yes .
yes , sir .
uh uh , i understand .
thank you , sir .
why don' t you come with me , little girl
on a magic carpet ride
well , you don' t know what we can see
why don' t you tell your dreams to me [ screams ]
well , i , uh
damn .
medical guys .
i had a feeling when they started doing all the blood tests that
i know it' s their ass if i get sick up there , but , i mean jesus !
oh , boy .
swigert , he' il be fine .
he' s , uh
he' s strong .
it' il be a hell of a mission .
one for the books .
you sure about this ?
why don' t i talk to deke ?
i' m sure we can work this out .
this was my call .
must' ve been a tough one .
look , i don' t have the measles .
i' m not gonna get the measles .
shit .
ken , wait up .
trajectory is holding steady .
we' re right on the line .
we' re into program 64 .
we' re in 05 g' s , so we' re feeling that gravity now .
houston , we are at 400, 000 feet passing entry interface .
about to lose signal .
reentry data is nominal , and we have radio blackout .
what' s the story here ?
i got a corridor light .
we' re comin ' in too shallow .
i' m goin ' to manual .
houston , switching to s. c. s. roger , thirteen .
okay , we' re at three g' s .
five g' s .
we' re comin ' in too steep .
i' il stay in this roll , see if i can pull us out .
we' re at eight g' s .
nine .
ten .
we' re at 12 g' s .
twelve g' s .
we' re burnin ' up .
damn it !
i gave ' em a false indicator light at entry interface .
even mattingly didn' t get it the first time .
how ya feelin ' , freddo ?
charbroiled .
so what happened ?
came in too steep .
we' re dead .
no shit .
yeah .
yeah , we were into program 67 there , so
okay , we' re gonna do this again , obviously , but give us a minute to get our switches reset .
jim , could we have a word ?
oh , sure , deke .
we' re going to drop off line and debrief .
so ?
well , if i had a dollar for every time they killed me in this thing ,
i wouldn' t have to work for you , deke .
well , we have two days .
we' il be ready .
let' s do it again .
do it again .
margaret , get them !
fred , stephen , come here !
daddy !
watch out !
you' il fall !
we can' t go across that road .
we don' t want daddy to get our germs and get sick in outer space .
hey , boys .
not givin ' your mom a hard time , are ya ?
princess , you look beautiful .
jack !
well , hey , that looks like marilyn lovell .
but it can' t be .
she' s not coming to the launch .
i heard it was gonna be a hell of a show .
who told you that ?

roger that , jack .
freddo , you okay ?
okay , let' s get turned around and pick up the lunar module .
odyssey , you' re go for pyro arm and docking , and we recommend you secure cabin pressurization .
roger that .
okay , we' re ready for c. s. m. separation .
okay , s. m. r. c. s. isol valves are all gray .
okay , swigert , command module pilot , she' s all yours .
houston , we' ve got a good separation .
the s 4b is stable .
translation looks good .
we confirm that , thirteen .
we' re gonna start to pitch around ... to line up with the lem .
you know , freddo , frank borman ... was upchuckin ' most of the way to the moon on apollo 8 .
i' m all right .
i just ate too much breakfast .
let' s go to work .
and pitching up .
pitch rate , 2 . 5 degrees per second .
roger , jack .
we see you pitching around .
keep an eye on that telemetry .
roger that . lf swigert can' t dock this thing , we don' t have a mission .
how' s the alignment ?
g. d. c. align .
thrusting forward .
one hundred feet .
watch the alignment , now .
ah , don' t worry , guys .
i' m on top of it .
fldo , let me know when you' re ready .
okay , let' s uplink that .
how we lookin ' ?
we' re not there yet .
forty feet .
twenty .
come on , rookie , park that thing .
ten feet .
capture .
that' s it .
talk back is barber pole .
go ahead and retract .
houston , we have hard dock .
roger , understand .
that' s a good deal , jack .
let' s start back up with procedure 17 .
okay , houston , we have lem extraction .
we copy that , thirteen .
now you' re off to the fra mauro highlands .
i gotta get out of this suit .
houston , we are ready ... for the beginning of the p. t. c. , and i think once we' re in that barbecue roll , jack and i will eat .
hey , i' m hungry .
are you sure ?
i could eat the ass out of a dead rhinoceros .
we got a smooth one , huh ?
by the numbers so far .
we just ran a minimum load test on the cooling system .
let me clean this up .
see you tomorrow .
take care .
it' s too bad we can' t demonstrate this on tv .
what a shame .
okay .
overboard dump comin ' up .
here it comes , the constellation urion .
now , that' s a beautiful sight .
barbara .
barbara , we are going to your father' s broadcast .
no !
i' m never coming out !
i hate paul !
no one else can ever play their records again !
she' s still going on about the stupid beatles breaking up ?
they' re not stupid !
you' re stupid !
barbara !
i know you' re in mourning .
i' m not going , mom !
dad won' t know if we' re there !
the whole world is going to be watching this broadcast , and so are we .
excuse me while l
okay , uh , good evening , america , and welcome aboard apollo 13 .
i' m jim lovell , and we' re broadcasting to you tonight ... from an altitude of almost 200, 000 miles ... away from the face of the earth , and we have a pretty good show in store for you tonight .
we are going to show you just what ...
susan .
barbara .
life is like for the three of us ... in the vast expanse of outer space .
one of the first things we' d like to do ... is provide you with the appropriate background music .
so , uh , hit it there , freddo .
hello , world !
that , uh , was supposed to be the theme to 2001 , in honor of our command module odyssey , but there seems to have been a change in the program .
when i go up on 19 , i' m gonna take my entire collection of johnny cash along .
hey , marilyn .
where' s their broadcast ?
all the networks dumped us .
one said we made goin ' to the moon as exciting as a trip to pittsburgh .
my son' s supposed to be on .
he' s in outer space .
this is all the channels we get , mrs. lovell .
it' s that damn tv guide again .
ruthless porters .

when i was just a lad of ten
my father said to me
come here and take  do they know they' re not on the air ?
we' il tell them when they get back .
don' t put your faith in love , my boy
my father said to me
uh , well , if anyone from the l . r. s. is watching ,
i forgot to file my 1040 return .
i meant to do it today , but
that' s no joke .
they' il jump on him .
well , folks , let' s head on down to the lunar excursion module .
follow me .
when we get ready to land on the moon ,
fred haise and i will float through this access tunnel ... into the lunar module , leaving
eecom , that stir' s gonna be ... on both h2 and both o2 tanks , is that correct ?
... the spacecraft will remain connected .
well , folks , as you can probably tell , the aquarius isn' t much bigger than a couple of telephone booths .
the skin of the lem in some places ... is only as ... as thick as a couple of layers ... of tinfoil , and that' s all that protects us from the vacuum of space .
we get away with this because the lem is designed only for flight in outer space .
fred haise , renaissance man .
okay , we' il head back up the tunnel now and back into the odyssey .
when you and your baby have a fallin ' out
all right , we' ve returned to the  [ bang ]
stand by one , houston .
gotcha !
houston , that bang you heard was fred haise on the cabin repress valve .
he gets our hearts goin ' every time with that one .
we' il go honky tonkin ' ' round this town
okay , we' re , uh , about to close out the aquarius ... and , uh , return to the odyssey .
our next broadcast will be from fra mauro on the surface of the moon .
so , uh , this is the crew of the apollo 13 ... wishing everyone back on earth a ... a pleasant evening .
all right .
daddy was funny .
they might air a few minutes of it on the news tonight .
you' d think so .
bye .
bye .
well , between jack' s back taxes and the fred haise show ,
i' d say that was a pretty successful broadcast .
that was an excellent show .
thank you very much , houston .
we' ve got a couple of housekeeping procedures .
we' d like you to roll right to 0 6 0 and null your rates .
roger that .
rolling right , 0 6 0 .
and then if you could give your oxygen tanks a stir .
roger that .
hey , we' ve got a problem here .
what did you do ?
nothing .
i stirred the tanks .
whoa !
hey !
uh , this is houston .
say again please .
houston , we have a problem .
we have a main bus b undervolt .
we' ve got a lot of thruster activity .
what' s with the computer now ?
it just went off line .
there' s another master alarm .
i' m checking the quad .
that was no repress valve .
maybe it' s in quad c.
we' ve got a computer restart .
i' m gonna reconfigure the r. c. s. we' ve got a ping light .
the way these are firing doesn' t make sense .
we' ve got multiple caution and warning .
we' ve got to reset and restart .
i' m going to s. c. s.
jesus .
flight , their heart rates are skyrocketing .
eecom , what' s your data telling you ?
o2 tank two not reading at all .
tank one is at 725 psi and falling .
fuel cells one and three are , uh
oh , boy , what' s going on here ?
flight , let me get back to you .
flight , they' re all over the place .
go , gnc .
they keep yawing close to gimbal lock .
i keep losing radio signal .
flight , their antennae must be flipped around .
they' re gonna have to do it manually .
one at a time , people .
ls this an instrumentation problem , or are we looking at power loss ?
it' s reading a quadruple failure .
that can' t happen .
it' s got to be instrumentation .
let' s get the hatch buttoned .
the lem might have been hit by a meteor .
the tunnel' s really torquin ' with all this movement .
houston , we had a pretty large bang there associated with a master alarm .
shit , it' s main bus a.
main bus a undervolt ?
main bus a undervolt down to
it' s reading 25 and a half .
main bus b is reading zip now .
we got a wicked shimmy up here .
these guys are talking about bangs and shimmies .
doesn' t sound like instrumentation .
you are breaking up , thirteen .
can' t get this hatch to seal .
just stow it . lf we' d been hit by a meteor , we' d be dead by now .
i' m gonna try to get us out of this lurch .
houston , did you say switch to omni bravo ?
roger that , thirteen .
the signal strength went way down .
it' s fighting me .
what' s the story ?
we keep flirting with gimbal lock .
we need a confirmation .
what systems do you have down ?
i' m having a hard time , rick .
s. m. r. c. s. helium one .
did you say switch to omni charlie ?
a and c are barber pole .
houston , i' m switching over quad c to main a.
roger that , thirteen .
okay , houston , fuel cell one , fuel cell three .
we got a main bus b undervolt , cryo pressure , suit compressor .
what don' t we have ?
a. c. bus one , a. c. bus two , command module computer and o2 flow high .
i don' t know .
maybe this is a caution and warning failure .
houston , we are venting something out into space .
i can see it outside of window one right now .
it' s definitely , uh ... a gas of some sort .
it' s got to be the oxygen .
roger , odyssey .
we copy your venting .
give me an alignment .
think about things we can connect .
let' s start at the beginning .
anything look abnormal ?
okay , listen up .
quiet down , people .
quiet down .
quiet down .
let' s stay cool , people .
procedures , i need another computer up in the r. t. c. c.
i want everybody to alert your support teams .
wake up anybody you need and get them in here .
let' s work the problem , people .
let' s not make things worse by guessin ' .
thirteen , houston .
we are going around the room .
we' re gonna get you answers .
we keep venting , we' re gonna keep hitting the edge of that deadband .
take a look at the o2 on number one .
200 pounds and falling .
o2 tank two still zero .
218 psi and falling .
ls that what you' re gettin ' ?
we' re seeing the same , thirteen .
can we review our status , sy ?
let' s look at this thing from a standpoint of status .
what have we got on the spacecraft that' s good ?
i' il get back to you , gene .
we' re not gonna have power much longer .
the ship' s bleedin ' to death .
flight ?
yeah .
go , eecom .
um , flight , i recommend we shut down the reactant valves of the fuel cells .
what the hell good is that gonna do ?
lf that' s where the leak is , we can isolate it there ... and we can save what' s left in the tanks and run on the good cell .
you close ' em , you can' t open ' em again .
you can' t land on the moon with one healthy fuel cell .
gene , the odyssey is dying .
from my chair here , this is the last option .
yeah , yeah , yeah , okay , sy .
capcom , let' s have them close the reactant valves .
thirteen , this is houston .
we want you to close react valves on cells one and three .
do you copy ?
are you saying you want the whole smash ?
closing down the react valves for fuel cells shut down ?
shutting down the fuel cells ?
did i hear you right ?
yeah , they heard me right .
tell them we think that' s the only way they can stop the leak .
yeah , jim .
we think that closing the react valves may stop the leak .
did he copy that ?
do you copy , jim ?
yes , houston , we copy .
we just lost the moon .
okay , freddo , shut those down .
let' s see what this does .
lf this doesn' t work , we' re not gonna have enough power left to get home .
shit !
goddamn it !
uh , houston , o2 on one is still falling .
freddo , how long does it take to power up the lem ?
three hours by the checklist .
we don' t have that much time .
shit !
jack , before the batteries completely die on us in here ,
let' s power down everything so we can save as much as we can for reentry .
fifteen minutes of oxygen and that' s it .
the command module will be dead .
okay .
okay , guys , listen up .
here' s the drill .
we' re moving the astronauts to the lem .
we' ve got to get some oxygen up there .
i want an emergency power up procedure .
the essential hardware only .
gnc , eecom , we' re gonna be shutting down the command module at the same time .
we' il have to transfer the guidance system from one computer to the other , so i want those numbers up and ready when our guys are in position .
we' ve gotta transfer all control data over the lem computer ... before the command module dies .
the lunar module just became a lifeboat .
odyssey , this is houston .
we need you to power down immediately .
you' re gonna have to power up the lem at the same time , so get somebody over there .
we already have freddo in the lem , houston .
we' ve got serious time pressure .
you' ve got to get the guidance program transferred , and you' ve got to do it before you' re out of power in the command module ... or you' re not gonna be able to navigate up there .
how much time ?
can you give me a number ?
we' re looking at less than 15 minutes of life support in the odyssey .
we' ve got 15 minutes , freddo .
it' s worse than i thought .
houston , be aware i' ve moved from the command module into the lem .
lf jack can' t get that guidance computer data transferred before they go dead
they won' t even know which way they' re pointed .
that' s right .
that' s a bad way to fly .
i' il be in 210 .
houston , this is thirteen .
are you back with me now ?
aquarius , this is houston .
you have about 12 minutes to power up .
i can' t see any stars .
there' s a lot of debris floatin ' around out there .
okay , houston , i have completed the steps on page 15 .
now i' m ready to power down the computer .
i' m gonna need your gimbal angles , jack , before you shut down the computer .
okay , jim .
i need this back to me before they power down .
all right , all right .
i got it .
hold on .
houston , our computer is up .
roger .
stand by .
jack , we need to proceed with steps 12 through 17 quickly .
you' re down to about eight minutes remaining .
fuel cell pump' s off .
o2 fans , tank two off .
okay , houston , check me .
i have completed these gimbal conversions , but i need a double check of the arithmetic .
yeah , you can go , jim .
the roll cal angle is minus two .
lunar module roll is 355 . 57 .
1678 correction .
167 . 78 .
yaw is 351 . 87 .
stand by .
we' re checking it .
we' ve got negative visibility in our star field , and if this paperwork isn' t right , who knows where we' il end up out here ?
looks good , flight .
it' s all right .
good here .
he' s good , andy .
we' il go on those numbers .
you' re good .
you add them in , freddo .
jack , turn off the l . m. u. switch to s. c. s.
stand by to turn off the thrusters .
over .
it' s a great day in new york .
it' s girl watchers ' weather .
i like those ingenious girl watchers who put on con edison helmets ... and dig trenches in the street to get a better view .
but l hey , speaking of girl watching , did you know that our first bachelor astronaut is on his way to the moon ?
ls it swigert ?
yeah , first bachelor .
he' s the kind , they say , has a girl in every port .
he has that reputation .
i think he' s sort of foolishly optimistic , taking nylons and hershey bars to the moon .
did you read that three million
what do you say ?
less viewers or fewer viewers ?
three million fewer viewers watched the space shot than did the last one .
uh , l colonel borman is h [ announcer ]
an abc new
here is abc science editor jules bergman .
the apollo 13 spacecraft has lost all electrical power , and astronauts jim lovell , fred haise and jack swigert ... are making their way through the tunnel to the lunar module , using it as a lifeboat , so they' il have electrical power for their radios on the command module .
apollo 13 is apparently also losing breathing oxygen [ marilyn ]
slow down .
an electrical failure .
what exactly does that mean ?
the emergency has ruled out any chance of a lunar landing ... and could endanger the lives of the astronauts themselves ... if the lem oxygen supply , plus whatever is left of the command module' s oxygen , can' t last them until they can get back to earth .
what do you mean there' s no immediate danger ?
i just heard they' re losing oxygen .
can they get back ?
the lem' s descent rocket engine will be used in aborting the mission ... and getting the astronauts safely back to earth .
the apollo 13 astronauts may be in grave danger .
no , don' t give me that nasa bullshit !
i want to know what' s happening with my husband !
we want to switch control to the aquarius now .
roger that .
houston , wait !
you' re down to about five minutes now , jack .
houston , be aware our r. c. s. isn' t up here yet .
we have no attitude control on aquarius .
they don' t have control ?
did we miss a step here ?
control , what the hell happened ?
what ?
i don' t know .
we' re all out of whack .
i' m trying to pitch down , but we' re yawing to the left .
why can' t i null this out ?
she wasn' t designed to fly attached like this .
it' s like flying with a dead elephant on our back .
flight , guidance .
we' re getting awfully close to center here .
watch that middle gimbal .
we don' t want you tumbling off into space .
freddo , inform houston i' m well aware of the goddamn gimbals !
roger that , houston .
i don' t need to hear the obvious .
i' ve got the frappin ' eight ball in front of me !
aquarius , this is houston .
we' ve got you both on vox .
you want what ?
you want us to go to vox ?
you have a hot mike .
we are reading everything you say .
sorry , jim .
it' s only by a very narrow margin ... that we' re going to get lovell , haise and swigert back alive .
marilyn ?
i' m sorry .
jeffrey' s calling for you . ... the terseness of kraft and the grim lines of jim mcdivitt .
this has been a very close call .
we' re not out of the woods yet .
jeffrey ?
why are so many people here ?
oh , well , you know ... your dad' s flying his mission .
he said he was going to get me a moon rock .
right .
well ... something broke on your daddy' s spaceship , and he' s gonna have to turn around before he even gets to the moon .
was it the door ?
thirteen , houston .
we still show that venting pushing you around .
how you doing ?
houston , aquarius .
we' ve had to learn how to fly all over again , but we are doing better now .
uh , roger that , aquarius .
have him close it out .
jack , we can close out your procedure now .
do we know for sure that we can power this thing back up ?
it' s gonna get awfully cold in here .
copy that , jack .
we' il just have to deal with that later .
computer off .
we' re clear .
we' re going to the lem .
we confirm shutdown , jack .
lunar module now in control .
roger that , houston .
this is odyssey signing off .
freddo , we' re gonna have to execute some sort of burn .
it' s a matter of when .
did they shut us all down in there ?
yeah .
didn' t think we' d be back in here so soon .
houston , how far off course do you project we are ?
over .
okay , people , listen up !
gentlemen , i want you all to forget the flight plan .
from this moment on , we are improvising a new mission .
oh , come on .
sorry about that .
we' il get somebody to look at that .
find a bulb around here .
how do we get our people home ?
they are here .
do we turn ' em around ?
straight back ?
direct abort ?
yes !
i can' t guarantee the burn yet .
no , sir , no , sir , no , sir !
we get them on a free return trajectory .
it' s the option with the fewest question marks for safety .
i agree with jerry .
we use the moon' s gravity to slingshot them around .
the lem will not support three guys for that amount of time .
we' ve got to do a direct abort .
we do an about face .
we bring the guys home .
get ' em back soon .
absolutely .
we don' t even know if the odyssey' s engine' s working .
lf there' s been serious damage to this spacecraft
they blow up and they die !
that is not the argument !
we are talking about time !
i' m not gonna sugarcoat this for you !
okay , hold it .
let' s hold it down .
hold it down , people .
the only engine with enough power for a direct abort ... is the s. p. s. on the service module .
from what lovell has told us , it could have been damaged in an explosion , so let' s consider that engine dead .
we light that thing up , could blow the whole works .
it' s just too risky .
we' re not gonna take that chance .
the command module is only good for reentry .
that leaves us with the lem , which means free return trajectory .
once we get the guys around the moon , we' il fire up the lem engine , make a long burn , pick up some speed and get ' em home as quick as we can .
gene , i' m wondering what the grumman guys think about this .
we can' t make any guarantees .
we designed the lem to land on the moon , not fire the engine out there for course corrections .
well , unfortunately , we' re not landing on the moon , are we ?
i don' t care what anything was designed to do .
i care about what it can do .
let' s get to work .
let' s lay it out , okay ?
capcom .
flight , he says it will be ready in time .
after this burn , we' ve got to build time in the flight plan for them to sleep .
run it by the f. a. o. i' ve run it by the f. a. o.
do we know how long we' re gonna fire that burn ?
he specifically wanted a quote from a flight director .
who wanted a quote ?
the president .
the president ?
nixon .
he wants odds .
we are not losing the crew .
i gotta give him odds .
five to one against ?
three to one ?
i don' t think they' re that good .
we are not losing those men !
how long are they gonna have to burn the engine ?
look , tell him ... three to one .
expect loss of signal in less than one minute .
when we pick you back up we will have your p. c. plus two burn data .
roger that , houston .
we' il hear from you again at acquisition of signal .
you wanna look ?
oh , look at that .
wow .
aquarius , that' s 30 seconds until loss of signal .
mare tranquillitatis .
neil and buzz' s old neighborhood .
comin ' up on mount marilyn .
jim , you gotta take a look at this .
i' ve seen it .
aquarius , this is houston .
we expect loss of signal in approximately ten seconds .
so long , earth .
catch you on the flip side .
when you go into the shadow of the moon ... and the moon is between you and the sun , then you see stars that are more brilliant than anything you' ve seen ... on the clearest nights here on earth .
and then you pass into the lunar sunrise over the lunar surface .
it must be an awe inspiring sight .
l l i can' t wait to see it myself .
the problem now is not so much a question of an adequate oxygen supply , but it is the rate of consumption of water , which is vitally needed for the cooling operations ... to maintain the electronic systems and so forth .
look , it' s fra mauro .
i can see our landing site .
wow .
look at the tsiolkovskii crater .
i can' t believe how bright the ejecta blanket is .
it' s like snow .
it' s beautiful .
that' s mare lmbrium to the north .
thirteen , this is houston .
we' re reading your telemetry .
it' s good to see you again .
good to see you too , houston .
we are picking you up at a velocity of 7, 062 feet per second ... at a distance from the moon of 56 nautical miles .
stand by for your p. c. plus two burn data .
gotta tell you , i had an itch to take this baby down , do some prospectin ' .
damn , we were close .
gentlemen , what are your intentions ?
i' d like to go home .
we got a burn coming up .
we' re gonna need a contingency if we lose comm with houston .
freddo , let' s get an idea where we stand on the consumables .
jack , get into the odyssey ... and bag up all the water you can before it freezes in there .
let' s go home .
aquarius , we got some p. c. plus two burn data for you fellas .
so you' re telling me you can only give our guys 45 hours ?
that brings them to about there .
gentlemen , that' s not acceptable .
gene , we' ve got to talk about power .
whoa , whoa , guys !
power is everything !
power is everything .
what do you mean ?
without it , they don' t talk to us , they don' t correct their trajectory , they don' t turn the heat shield around .
we gotta turn everything off now .
they' re not gonna make it to reentry .
what do you mean , " everything " ?
with everything on , the lem draws 60 amps .
at that rate , in 16 hours the batteries are dead , not 45 .
and so is the crew .
we gotta get them down to 12 amps .
twelve amps ?
how many ?
you can' t run a vacuum cleaner on 12 amps , john .
we gotta turn off we have to turn off the radars , cabin heater , instrument displays , the guidance computer , the whole smash .
whoa !
guidance computer .
what if they need to do another burn ?
they won' t even know which way they' re pointed .
the more time we talk , the more juice they waste .
that' s the deal ?
that' s the deal .
okay , john .
the minute we finish the burn , we' il power down the lem .
all right .
now in the meantime , we' re gonna have a frozen command module up there .
we' re gonna have to power it up using nothing but the reentry batteries .
that' s never been tried .
we' ve never even simulated it before .
well , we' re gonna have to figure it out .
i want people in our simulators working reentry scenarios .
i want you guys to find every engineer who designed every switch , circuit , and light bulb that' s up there .
then talk to the guy in the assembly line who actually built the thing .
find out how to squeeze every amp out of both of these goddamn machines .
i want this mark all the way back to earth with time to spare .
we never lost an american in space .
we' re sure as hell not gonna lose one on my watch .
failure is not an option .
ken ?
ken ?
what ?
huh ?
good , you' re not dead .
i' ve been trying to get in touch with you for 45 minutes .
jesus , john , what are you doing here ?
i gotta get you in the simulators .
we got a ship to land .
what ?
there' s been an explosion .
oxygen tanks are gone .
two fuel cells gone .
command module shut down .
what about the crew ?
crew' s fine so far .
trying to keep them alive in the lem .
we' re gonna have to shut that down pretty soon too .
we got a lot of people working the numbers on this one , ken .
nobody' s too sure how much power we' re gonna have when we hit reentry .
the command module' s gonna be frozen up pretty good by then .
you see this ammeter rise over 20 at any point , power up is no good .
we see it spike , that' s sayonara for the guidance computer .
our guys can' t reenter .
okay ?
how much power do we have to play with ?
barely enough to run this coffee pot for nine hours .
go .
yeah , ken mattingly just got here .
copy .
he' s here .
they' ve been losing heat since the accident .
they' re gonna start getting water condensation on the control panels .
ken , you know what' s going on ?
john' s brought me up to speed .
what do we have left in the batteries ?
we don' t really know .
we gotta get started on some shortcuts for power up .
yeah .
you know how short ?
it' s all in the sequencing .
lf we can skip whatever we don' t absolutely need ... and turn things on in the right order , maybe
i agree .
you started on a procedure ?
the engineers have tried , but it' s your ship .
we gotta get you in there .
okay .
frank , i need the sim cold and dark .
give me the exact same conditions they' ve got in there now .
and i need present status of every instrument .
i need a flashlight .
that' s not what they have up there .
don' t give me anything they don' t have on board .
let' s get this show on the road .
put him in space , fellas .
okay , houston , the quad heater circuit breakers are open .
we' re using the forward omni when the earth' s in the window , and we' re switching to aft omni when we see the moon .
we copy that , thirteen .
aquarius , we don' t want you to make any more waste dumps .
the venting may push you off course .
oh , christ .
what' s up ?
no more waste dumps .
we' re just gonna have to store it .
jack , we' re gonna need some more urine bags .
okay , houston , that leaves us with just the computer , which i' m shutting down now .
and that' s it .
we just put sir lsaac newton in the driver' s seat .
ls it a. m. or p. m. ?
a. m. very , very a. m.
haise is running a temperature , and none of them has slept .
i can' t order these guys to go to sleep .
could you sleep up there ?
it' s gonna get cold in there for them .
gene , we have a situation brewing with the carbon dioxide .
we got a co2 filter problem on the lunar module .
five filters on the lem .
meant for two guys for a day and a half .
they' re already up to eight on the gauges .
anything over 15 and you get ... impaired judgment , blackouts , the beginnings of brain asphyxia .
what about the scrubbers on the command module ?
they take square cartridges .
the ones on the lem are round .
tell me this isn' t a government operation .
this just isn' t a contingency we' ve remotely looked at .
those co2 levels are gonna be getting toxic .
well , i suggest you gentlemen invent a way ... to put a square peg in a round hole ... rapidly .
okay , people , listen up .
the people upstairs have handed us this one , and we gotta come through .
we gotta find a way to make this ... fit into the hole for this ... using nothing but that .
let' s get it organized .
okay , let' s build a filter .
better get some coffee going too , someone .
the haise family lives in el lago , texas .
his wife , mary , is from biloxi , mississippi .
when fred haise was growing up in biloxi , he may have looked ahead to a fine family , but he never dreamt of flying .
i' d never flown really before i went into the service , and i only went into the flying business as a means to getting a commission .
good morning .
henry .
don' t you ever sleep ?
i have a request from the news people .
they want to put a transmitter up on the lawn .
transmitter ?
it' s kind of a tower for a live broadcast .
i thought they didn' t care about this mission .
they didn' t even run jim' s show .
well ... it' s more dramatic now .
suddenly people are
lf landing on the moon wasn' t dramatic enough , why should not landing be ?
look , i , um , realize how hard this is , marilyn , but the whole world is caught up in it .
it' s the biggest story since  no , henry .
those people don' t put one piece of equipment on my lawn .
lf they have a problem with that , they can take it up with my husband .
he' il be home on friday .
when you are sad and lonely
and have no place to go
and have no place to go
come to see me , baby and bring along some dough
and we' il go honky tonkin ' honky tonkin '
honky tonkin ' , honey baby
we' il go honky tonkin ' ' round this town
hey , freddo .
it' s too cold in there .
yeah .
that' s a nice one of mary .
you don' t look too good , freddo .
i' il survive .
there' s aspirin in the medical kit .
i took some .
jim , i' m all right .
it was an accident , mary gettin ' pregnant .
you should have seen the look on my face when she told me .
well , that has a tendency to happen .
yeah .
i wonder if it' s a boy or a girl .
you' re gonna find out soon enough .
sure .
i never dreamed i' d ever get to do something like this : come up here on a real mission .
most of the guys i graduated high school with ... never even left home , and here i am .
oh , yeah ... here you are .
it hurts when i urinate .
well , you' re not gettin ' enough water .
i' m drinking my ration the same as you .
i think old swigert gave me the clap .
he' s been pissin ' in my relief tube .
well ... that will be a hot one at the debriefing for the flight surgeon .
that' s another first for america' s space program .
listen , um ...
i' ve been going ... over some stuff ,
listen , um ...
i' ve been going ... over some stuff , and i' m a little worried about this cold affecting our battery efficiency .
we quit heatin ' the glycol to save water and power , so that' s not helping .
it could cost us amp hours on the back end ?
that' s a possibility .
i' ve been goin ' over the numbers again .
have they called up with a reentry plan yet ?
we' re comin ' in too shallow and fast .
we' re workin ' on something .
hold on .
i can' t remember the ratio to temperature .
we got no references on board .
let' s see if houston can pull up the mill specs .
listen !
they gave us too much delta v. they had us burn too long .
at this rate we' re gonna skip out of the atmosphere and never get back .
what are you talkin ' about ?
how' d you figure that ?
i can add .
they' ve got half the ph. d. s on the planet working on this .
houston says we' re on the money .
what if they made a mistake and there was no way to reverse it ?
would they tell us ?
there' s no reason for them to tell us !
what do you mean ?
that' s bullshit !
there' s a thousand things that have to happen in order .
we are on number eight .
you' re talking about number 692 .
ln the meantime , i' m trying to tell you we' re coming in too fast .
i think they know it , and that' s why we don' t have a goddamn reentry plan .
that' s duly noted .
thank you , jack .
ow !
goddamn this piece of shit !
hey !
this piece of shit' s gonna get you home .
that' s because that' s the only thing we got left , jack !
what are you saying , fred ?
i think you know what i' m saying .
now wait a minute .
all i did was stir those tanks .
what was that gauge reading before you hit the switch ?
don' t tell me how to fly the c. m. !
you don' t know , do you ?
they brought me in to do a job !
they asked me to stir the tanks , and i stirred the tanks !
stop kicking yourself in the ass .
this is not my fault !
no one is saying it is .
lf i' m in the left hand seat when the call comes up , i stir the tanks .
yeah , well , tell him that .
i asked you what the gauge was readin ' ,
and you don' t know !
look , we are not gonna do this .
we' re not gonna go bouncing off the walls for ten minutes ... because we' re just gonna end up right back here with the same problems !
try to figure out how to stay alive !
aquarius , this is houston .
are we on vox ?
no , we' re not on vox .
yeah , houston , this is aquarius .
go ahead .
yeah , jim , could you check your co2 gauge for us ?
yeah , houston , we were just looking at that .
our co2 measurement has jumped four notches in the last hour .
that can' t be right .
i went over those numbers three times .
jim , that sounds about right .
we were expecting that .
that' s very comforting , houston .
what do we do about it ?
we' re working on a procedure down here for you .
do you copy ?
oh , christ .
all right , houston , we' re standing by for those procedures .
christ , i know why my numbers are wrong .
i only figured it for two people .
maybe i should just hold my breath .
the deadly co2 gas ... is poisoning the astronauts with every breath in and out .
heads up .
heads up .
oh !
go , go , go , go !
someone get that .
damn .
heads up , people .
look out now .
what' s this ?
that' s what they gotta make .
i hope you got the procedures for me .
right here .
that' s it ?
all right , aquarius , this is houston .
do you have a flight plan ?
affirmative , andy .
jack' s got one right here .
okay , we have an unusual procedure for you here .
we need you to rip the cover off .
he wants you to rip the cover off the flight plan .
with pleasure .
the other materials you' re gonna need here are ...
a lithium hydroxide canister  two , two .
two lithium hydroxide canisters .
i' m sorry .
a roll of gray tape .
duct tape .
duct tape .
you need an l. c. g. bag two l. c. g. bags .
the red suit hoses , and you' ve got the flight plan cover .
can you give me a timetable ?
henry !
henry !
what about their level of carbon dioxide ?
it' s , uh , climbing .
you' re saying that they' re almost out of breathable air ?
wait a second .
that' s not what he said .
he said we' re working on it .
you want to cut the duct tape three feet long .
tell him to use his arm .
just use your arm .
it' s a good arm length .
i see what you' re getting at .
hold on .
jack , tear that piece of tape down the middle lengthwise .
all right ?
hold on , houston .
while the astronauts appear to have enough oxygen to keep them alive , one thing they have too much of is carbon dioxide .
with each breath , the three men expel ... more of the poisonous gas into the lunar module cockpit , and the scrubbers intended to keep the atmosphere breathable ... are quickly becoming saturated .
oh , shit .
i tore it .
shit !
houston , what do we do if we ripped the bag ?
can we tape it ?
they just tore the bag .
oh , no .
uh , stand by .
what should i tell ' em to do ?
they should have one more .
but they' ve still got a long way to come .
they are now working on their backup facilities , their emergency facilities .
the problem is , if anything more goes wrong , they' re in real trouble .
as most of you are aware , there is no rescue possible in space flight .
any rescue system the space agency has long since calculated
hold this a minute .
since any rescue system the space agency calculated
one sock .
once you have the sock in place ,
we' re gonna want you to bungee ...
work it in . the entire filter assembly to the bulkhead ,
right above the lem canister .
we' re getting close to 15 .
so how does this flight compare to other emergency situations you' ve faced ?
i' d have to say that this is the most serious situation ... we' ve ever encountered in manned space flight .
houston , filter' s in place .
cabin gas return to egress .
suit circuit relief to close .
co2 canister select to secondary .
all right .
here goes .
i can hear air moving .
just breathe normal , fellas .
aquarius , please advise on co2 status .
yeah , houston , we' re taking a look at those numbers now .
we' re still holding close to 15 , houston .
roger that .
standing by .
houston , the co2 level has dropped to nine ... and it is still falling .
yes !
great .
good job , you guys .
that is good to hear , aquarius .
and you , sir , are a steely eyed missile man .
okay , spacecraft control to computer .
damn !
damn .
we overloaded .
we used way too much power .
there must be a sneak circuit between step seven and ten .
which one has the leak ?
don' t know that yet , john .
the sequence was wrong .
we have to go back and try ' em one at a time .
you need a break , ken ?
lf they don' t get one , i don' t get one .
well , if it won' t work , get me another one .
my son' s supposed to be on .
i know , mrs. lovell .
hi , blanch .
they can' t fix a thing in this place .
blanch , it' s marilyn .
hi , grandma .
i was gonna see jimmy .
i know .
i know .
we came to tell you something .
there' s been an accident .
jimmy' s okay .
he' s all right .
but he' s not gonna get to walk on the moon .
well , they said he was .
i know .
i know .
um ... that was before .
now there' s been an explosion , and they' re all okay .
they' re all right .
but now they' re just going to ... try to figure out a way to get them home .
and  [ sobbing ]
and it' s a little bit dangerous .
oh , sweetie .
are you scared ?
well , don' t you worry , honey .
lf they could get a washing machine to fly , my jimmy could land it .
you saw me standing alone
without a dream in my heart
without a love of my own
jack , you' il be happy to hear we contacted president nixon , and he' s gonna grant you an extension on your income taxes ... since you are most decidedly out of the country .
roger that , houston .
that' s wonderful news .
tell them they have to sleep .
haise is running a fever of 104 .
thirteen , we' ve had another request from the flight surgeon ... that you fellas get more sleep .
he doesn' t like his readings down here .
let' s see how he feels about this .
i am sick and tired of the entire western world ... knowing how my kidneys are functioning !
flight , i just lost lovell !
uh , thirteen , this is houston .
jim , we just had a dropout on your bio med sensors .
i' m not wearing my bio med sensors , houston .
okay , jim .
copy that .
now i' m losing all three of ' em !
it' s just a little medical mutiny , doc .
i' m sure the guys are still with us .
let' s cut ' em some slack , okay ?
it' s not the velocity , it' s the angle .
maybe they' re still venting something that' s throwing off the trajectory , but we are definitely shallowing again .
we are up to a 5 . 9 .
damn it .
at this rate , they nick the earth' s atmosphere and bounce off into space .
we need another burn to get them back in the corridor .
another burn .
copy that .
fire the engines and get ' em on course .
aquarius , this is houston .
houston , aquarius .
jim , we' ve got another course correction for you .
what' s up ?
something about another course correction .
uh , we copy , houston .
be advised it' s gonna take freddo and i a while to power up the computer ... for the alignment platform if we have to fire the engine .
negative on that , jim .
we can' t spare power for the computer .
we gotta do this blind ?
without the computer , what do we use for orientation ?
we' ve got to be able to give these guys something .
without the power , we can' t give them a reading .
i' m not talking about power , i' m talking about reference .
no , there' s no references .
we have debris up there .
houston , what' s the story with this burn ?
we' re trying to hash something out down here , aquarius .
stand by .
look , houston .
all we need to hold attitude is one fixed point in space .
ls that not correct ?
yeah .
roger that , jim .
well , houston , we' ve got one .
lf we can keep the earth in the window , flying manually , the co ax crosshairs right on its terminator , all i have to know is : how long do we need to burn the engine ?
the shorter , the better .
roger that , jim .
can they fly it manually and still shut it down ... on time without the computer ?
i guess that' s the best we can do .
we' re out of time .
ln order to enter the atmosphere safely , the crew must aim for a corridor just two and a half degrees wide .
lf they' re too steep , they' il incinerate in the steadily thickening air .
lf they' re too shallow , they' il ricochet ... off the atmosphere like a rock skipping off a pond .
the reentry corridor is , in fact , so narrow ... that if this basketball were the earth ... and this softball were the moon , and the two were placed 14 feet apart , the crew would have to hit a target no thicker than this piece of paper .
okay , people , on your toes .
we' re doing this one blind .
gene , i want you to understand we' ve never tried this before : burn , cold soak , burn , cold soak , burn , manual control .
it will ignite , will it not ?
i just want you to know the engine' s never been tried like this .
that' s all i' m trying to tell you .
i know what you' re trying to do .
i won' t hold you personally responsible .
lf it lights , it lights .
let lovell do the rest .
okay .
they' re gonna burn the engines and steer it manually , attempting to keep the earth in the window .
okay , this is gonna take all three of us .
freddo ...
you handle the pitch .
put on the translation controllers , all backwards .
so if the earth starts drifting down , [ coughs ]
you need to thrust aft , not forward .
i' il do the same on mine with everything else .
we' re going to burn at ten percent thrust for 39 seconds .
jack , you time us .
got it .
give us a count of the last ten seconds up to 39 .
let' s not miss this .
you up to this , freddo ?
i' m with you .
standing by for corridor control burn .
okay , jim , you can fire when ready .
you are go for the manual burn .
okay , x plus button at ten seconds .
mark .
come on , baby .
one more burn .
nine , eight , seven , six , five ,
four , three , ullage is go . two , one , ignition !
she' s burnin ' !
oh , yeah .
master arm off .
okay , here we go .
helium regulator on .
r. c. s. is go , ten percent thrust .
bring her around , freddo .
i' m tryin ' , but it' s draggin ' .
ten seconds .
all right , drop it down , freddo .
we' re driftin ' !
no , hold what you got .
i' il roll it .
back off .
i can' t get it stable .
she' s dancin ' all over the place !
come to the right a little bit .
fifteen seconds .
she' s driftin ' .
i' m losin ' attitude .
hold it right there .
that' s it .
no , freddo , back !
shit !
i' m losin ' it !
bring the earth up .
forward , fred .
come on .
forward .
shit , i lost it !
where is it ?
where is it ?
seven o' clock .
helium regulator' s closed .
bring it down , freddo .
just nose it down .
okay , uh , okay , i got it !
thirty seconds .
little farther .
ease your touch !
she' s comin ' in .
damn it !
damn it , that' s mine .
that' s me .
around .
a little more .
come on , baby .
that' s it .
hold it .
damn it !
back !
that' s it !
hold it !
steady . ... seven , eight , nine !
shutdown !
houston , we have shutdown .
that' s close enough , jim .
good work .
i knew it !
i knew it !
how about that lem , huh ?
how about it ?
guess you can keep your job .
you betcha .
thirteen , stand by .
we' re evaluating our power usage on that burn .
well , let' s hope we don' t have to do that again .
gentlemen , you' ve given our guys enough to survive ' til reentry .
well done .
now we gotta get ' em in , so tell me about the power up procedures .
here' s the order of what i want to do .
i want to power up guidance , e. c. s. , communications , warm up the pyros for the parachutes and the command module thrusters .
the thrusters are gonna put you over budget on amps .
they' ve been sitting at 200 below for four days .
they gotta be heated .
fine .
then trade off the parachutes , something .
well , if the chutes don' t open , what' s the point ?
you' re telling me what you need .
i' m telling you what we have to work .
i' m not making this stuff up .
they will need all these systems , john .
we do not have the power , ken .
we just don' t have it .
okay , i' m gonna go back and reorganize the sequencing again ... and find more power .
let' s start from scratch .
clear the board .
i don' t know where the hell we' re gonna find it .
apollo 13 commander jim lovell has more time in space , almost 24 days already , than any other man , and i asked him recently if he ever was scared .
i' ve had an engine flame out a few times in an aircraft ... and was curious as to whether it was going to light up again , things of that nature , but , uh , they seem to work out .
ls there an instance in an airplane emergency when you can recall fear ?
i remember one time , i' m in a banshee at night in combat conditions , so there' s no running lights on the carrier .
it was the shangri la , and we were in the sea of japan .
my radar had jammed , and my homing signal was gone ... because somebody in japan was actually using the same frequency , and so it was leading me away from where i was supposed to be .
i' m looking down at a big , black ocean , so i flip on my map light .
then , suddenly , zap , everything shorts out right there in my cockpit .
all my instruments and lights are gone .
i can' t even tell what my altitude is .
i know i' m running out of fuel , so i' m thinking about ditching into the ocean .
i look down there and then , in the darkness , there' s this , uh , there' s this green trail .
it' s like a long carpet that' s laid out beneath me .
it was the algae .
it was that phosphorescent stuff that gets churned up in the wake of a ship .
it was , it was , it was just leading me home .
now , if my cockpit lights hadn' t shorted out , there' s no way i' d have ever been able to see that .
so , uh , you , uh , you never know ... what , what events are going to transpire to get you home .
spacecraft commander jim lovell , no stranger to emergencies .
how' s it going , fred ?
i' m okay .
what the hell was that ?
let' s hope it was just the burst disk .
houston , can you confirm a burst helium disk ?
we confirm that .
houston , is that going to affect our , uh , entry angle at all ?
uh , negative .
your entry angle is holding at 6 . 24 , aquarius .
houston , uh ... we , we sure could use ... the reentry procedure up here .
when can we expect that ?
uh , that' s coming real soon , aquarius .
uh , houston , we , we
we just can' t throw this together at the last minute .
so , here' s what you' re gonna do .
you' re gonna get the procedure up to us , whatever it is , and we' re gonna go over it step by step , so there' s no foul ups .
i don' t have to tell you we' re all a little tired up here .
the world' s getting awfully big in the window .
jim , this is deke .
it' s deke .
they don' t know how to do it .
maybe jack' s right .
hello , deke .
what' s the story ?
we' re gonna get that power up procedure to you .
we' re gonna get it as soon as we possibly can .
ken mattingly' s in the simulator right now .
ken' s working on it ?
look ...
i know this sequence works , john .
the sequence looks good .
we' re over budget on the amperage .
by how much ?
three or four amps .
goddamn it , john !
ls it three or four ?
four .
four !
four more amps .
we know they have some power left in the lem batteries , right ?
yeah .
we have an umbilical that provides power from the command module to the lem .
right .
it' s backup for the lem power supply .
i' m listening .
so ... reverse it .
reverse the flow and see if we can draw these four amps ... from the lem batteries before we cut it lose .
why can' t we do that ?
do we have a procedure for that ?
you' re gonna lose a lot in the transfer , ken .
yeah , yeah , but all we' re talking about here is four amps .
i want whatever you guys got on these power procedures .
gene , they' re already
i don' t want the whole bible , just a couple of chapters .
we' ve got to get something up to them .
they' re working on it .
i' il call the simulator and get an estimate .
goddamn it !
i don' t want another estimate !
i want the procedures , now !
l . m. u. is up .
how am i reading ?
fine , so far .
say again .
you' re under the limit .
keep going .
okay .
floodlights to fixed .
okay , i' m bringing up the guidance .
here we go .
c. m. c. attitude l . m. u.
c. m. c. source .
c. m. c. mode , auto , and we' re on the computer .
ken ?
go ahead .
ls your computer on now ?
up and running .
how do we look ?
john ?
i think we got it , buddy .
arthur , my notes are clear on that last sequence , right ?
excuse me , gentlemen .
i was getting a little blurry there .
here' s ken .
here' s john .
it' s good to see you , ken .
this is the sequence .
was it tried on the hardware yet ?
we didn' t have time .
aquarius , houston .
do you read ?
yeah , we read you , ken .
are the flowers blooming in houston ?
uh , that' s a negative , jim .
i don' t have the measles .
jim , is jack in there with you ?
uh , yeah , stand by one .
we gotta get him on comm .
put those on the table .
oh , damn it .
thanks , jackie .
i think it would really help if you could ... just distract her when the heavy predictions come in .
yeah , yeah .
we' il give it a shot .
thanks .
blanch .
blanch , these nice , young men are gonna watch the television with you .
this is neil armstrong , and this is buzz aldrin .
hi .
are you boys in the space program too ?
okay , jack , give me a read back on that last procedure .
uh , stand by , ken .
ken , i' m having trouble reading my own writing .
i guess i was a little more tired than i thought .
uh , don' t worry , jack .
i' il talk you through it .
okay , find the main bus breakers on panel 11 .
yeah , main bus breakers .
got it .
close main bus b. [ sighs ]
ken , there' s an awful lot of condensation on these panels .
what' s the word on these things shorting out ?
uh , we' il just take that one at a time , jack .
it' s like tryin ' to drive a toaster through a car wash .
main bus b is closed .
okay , thirteen , we' re coming up on entry interface .
flight , we' re still shallowing up a bit in the reentry corridor .
it' s almost like they' re underweight .
now how could they be underweight ?
we didn' t land on the moon .
rocks ?
that' s affirm .
uh , one more thing , jim .
while jack' s working on the power up , we' d like you and freddo ... to transfer some ballast over to the command module .
uh , say again , houston .
ballast ?
um , that' s affirm .
we got to get the weight right .
we were expecting you to be toting a couple hundred pounds of moon rocks .
right , houston .
now , jack .
yeah , go ahead , ken .
okay , now , uh , panel five .
circuit breaker caution and warning main b closed .
main b closed .
master alarm off .
okay , jack , uh , on panel seven , b mag number two , power to warm up .
b mag number two , power to warm up done .
sequential logic one and two on .
sequential logic ... two on .
c. m. r. c. s. pressure on .
c. m. r. c. s. pressurization .
as her husband prepares to jettison his lunar module lifeboat ,
marilyn lovell waits with her children , her neighbors ... and , we are told , apollo 11 astronauts neil armstrong and buzz aldrin .
only the lovell' s eldest son , jay , is absent ... as he holds vigil with his classmates ... at the st. johns military academy in wisconsin .
abc news science editor jules bergman .
with a crippled command module , and surviving by using the lem' s systems , there can be no easy maneuver .
their lem lifeboat is doing things and working longer ... than it was ever intended to .
it' s a race against time until splashdown .
okay , jack , we' re ready to see if the computer will accept ... uplink of the reentry data now . uplink of the reentry data now .
okay , the l . m. u. is up .
we got our eight balls back .
copy that .
okay , ken , uh , uplink telemetry , command module to accept , right ?
that' s affirm .
go ahead and try it .
come on .
uplink completed .
yeah .
that' s more like it .
we' re back in business .
yeah .
okay , let' s go .
look at your amps .
how we doin ' ?
we got her back up , ken .
boy , i wish you were here to see it .
i' il bet you do .
way to go , jack .
flight , this is retro .
go , retro .
flight , we are looking at a typhoon warning ...
on the edge of the prime recovery zone .
say again , retro .
we are looking at a typhoon warning on the edge of the prime recovery area .
this is just a warning .
it could miss them .
only if their luck changes .
jim , we' re ready for s. m. jettison !
all right , jack , on three !
one ... two ...
upward thrust .
we' re loose !
reverse thrust !
we have service module jettison .
okay , houston , service module is free .
we' re gonna take a look at what we have here .
copy that .
there it is .
i see it !
oh .
houston , we' re getting our first look at the service module now .
one whole side of the spacecraft is missing .
right by the high gain antennae a whole panel is blown out , right up , right up to our heat shield .
uh , copy that , aquarius .
it looked like it got the engine bell too .
can you see that ?
oh , man , that' s incredible .
the heat shield .
the heat will build up to as much as 3, 000 or 4, 000 degrees fahrenheit .
on a lunar reentry flight , the heat approaches 4, 000 degrees .
so , uh , blanch ?
blanch ?
did jim make eagle scout or not ?
yes , he did .
he did .
lf the heat shield is even slightly cracked , the extreme cold could have split it wide open .
worst of all , if the pyrotechnics that control the parachutes ... have been damaged , the chutes may not open at all , causing the spacecraft to hit the water not at a gentle 20 miles per hour , but at a suicidal 300 .
perhaps never in human history ... has the entire world been united by such a global drama .
ln new york city , thousands of people have gathered ... to watch updates of the mission in times square .
many countries offered help , and the state department said ... it would ask for it if it were needed .
the house and senate passed resolutions calling on the american people ... to pray tonight for the astronauts .
ln rome , pope paul led 50, 000 people ... in prayers for the safe return of the astronauts .
ln jerusalem , prayers at the wailing wall .
uh , it' s about time to bail out of this ship , freddo .
freddo ?
you okay ?
i' m , uh i' m freezing .
can you hold out just a little longer ?
long as i have to .
aw , come on .
it won' t be long .
just a little while longer , freddo .
just a little while longer .
we' re gonna hit that water in the south pacific .
open up that hatch .
it' s 80 degrees out there .
eighty degrees .
you are a mess .
y yeah .
odyssey , houston .
uh , how we doin ' , guys ?
we' re closing in on lunar module jettison .
as you know , that is time critical .
we should be making our move into the command module .
let' s get that hatch buttoned up , and , when you get a chance , let us know how you' re doing .
roger that .
here , let me give you a hand there , freddo .
we' re coming up on lem jettison .
ls everyone strapped in , ken ?
we' re getting real close .
copy that , flight .
thirteen , houston .
we' re coming up on lem jettison .
stand by .
have you got everybody in the odyssey ?
yeah , ken , i' m gonna check those pyro batteries one more time here .
okay , the pyro batts look good .
i don' t think we' re gonna have to tie the other batteries .
sorry , jack , it' s an old habit .
i' m kind of used to the pilot' s seat .
she' s yours to fly .
okay , odyssey , i want to double check some reentry procedures ... right after we jettison the lem , which is coming up in 30 seconds .
what is that ?
oh , i was getting a little punchy , and i didn' t want to cut the lem loose with you guys still in it .
that' s good thinking .
stand by , houston .
we have lunar module jettison .
she sure was a good ship .
farewell , aquarius , and we thank you .
mary ?
it' s almost time , honey .
flight 9 6 6 4 0 6 ... [ crewmen continue , lndistinct ]
let me put it this way .
the trajectory may be off .
their thrusters may be frozen .
their guidance system might be malfunctioning .
their heat shield could be cracked .
and their parachutes might be three blocks of ice .
clearly , we have some obstacles to overcome .
okay , but now i' m asking you , when will we know ?
well , blackout lasts for three minutes .
lf they' re not back in four , we' il know .
velocity now reading 34, 802 feet per second .
range to go 2, 625 nautical miles .
copy that .
okay , ken , we are aligned for reentry .
we need that computer reentry program .
fred , how are the batteries looking ?
okay .
batt a looks good .
reentry interface in one minute ...
no volts , the amps are okay . and 30 seconds .
shit , no volts , only two amps .
it may die before the main chutes open .
roger .
let' s tie all the batteries onto main a and main b.
flight , they' re still shallowing a bit up there .
do you want to tell ' em ?
ls there anything we can do about it ?
not now , flight .
then they don' t need to know , do they ?
copy that .
retro says the typhoon is still a presence in the splashdown area ?
yeah .
we got the parachute situation , the heat shield , the angle of trajectory and the typhoon .
there' s so many variables , i' m at a loss
i know what the problems are .
this could be the worst disaster nasa' s ever experienced .
with all due respect , sir , i believe this is going to be our finest hour .
okay .
expect entry interface in 45 seconds .
and on my mark , your velocity ... will be 35, 245 feet per second .
35 seconds to entry interface .
gentlemen ... it' s been a privilege flying with you .
flight , we have loss of radio contact .
roger that .
expect to regain signal in three minutes .
it all depends on the heat shield .
back to the lwo jima and our live cameras there .
the navy recovery and rescue helicopters already airborne , circling , waiting for first radar contact .
coming up now on three minutes until time of drogue deployment .
standing by for any reports of acquisition .
one minute and 30 seconds to end of blackout .
no reentering ship has ever taken longer ... than three minutes to emerge from blackout .
this is the critical moment .
will the heat shield hold ?
will the command module survive the intense heat of reentry ?
lf it doesn' t , there' il only be silence .
mommy , you' re squishing me .
oops , sorry , sweetie .
it' s okay .
okay , flight , that' s three minutes .
we are standing by for acquisition .
copy that .
odyssey , houston .
do you read me ?
odyssey , this is houston .
do you read ?
expected time of reacquisition , the time when the astronauts were expected to come out of blackout , has come and gone .
about all any of us can do now is just listen and hope .
we' re about to learn whether or not that heat shield , which was damaged by the explosion three days ago , has withstood the inferno of reentry .
odyssey , this is houston .
do you read me ?
odyssey , houston .
do you read ?
three minutes , 30 seconds .
standing by .
odyssey , houston .
do you read ?
odyssey , this is houston .
do you read me ?
that' s four minutes .
standing by .
odyssey , uh , houston .
do you read ?
hello , houston , this is odyssey .
it' s good to see you again .
odyssey , houston .
welcome home .
we' re glad to see you .
good job , ken .
good job .
thank you .
they made it .
they made it .
houston , we' re at stable one .
the ship is secure .
this is apollo 13 signing off .
good job .
our mission was called a successful failure , in that we returned safely but never made it to the moon .
ln the following months , it was determined ... that a damaged coil built inside the oxygen tank ... sparked during our cryo stir and caused the explosion that crippled the odyssey .
it was a minor defect that occurred two years ... before i was even named the flight' s commander .
fred haise was going back to the moon on apollo 18 , but his mission was canceled because of budget cuts .
he never flew in space again .
nor did jack swigert , who left the astronaut corps ... and was elected to congress from the state of colorado .
but he died of cancer before he was able to take office .
ken mattingly orbited the moon as command module pilot of apollo 16 ... and flew the space shuttle , having never gotten the measles .
gene kranz retired as director of flight operations just not long ago .
and many other members of mission control have gone on to other things , but some are still there .
and as for me ... the seven extraordinary days of apollo 13 were my last in space .
i watched other men walk on the moon and return safely , all from the confines of mission control and our house in houston .
i sometimes catch myself looking up at the moon , remembering the changes of fortune in our long voyage , thinking of the thousands of people who worked to bring the three of us home .
i look up at the moon and wonder ... when will we be going back ... and who will that be ? " takas ve sat iin vcddivx@ hotmail . com
