oh , shit .
oh , my god .
oh , my god .
do you realize what a shitstorm we' re in ?
go on , tell me .
nothing to tell .
he screamed for help .
you heard no sounds of violence till then ?
nothing we haven' t heard before .
maybe i should call the police .
oh , jesus .
what ?
bill ... ... why don' t you think about that .
just take a second ... ... and think about that .
think real ... ... fucking ... ... hard .
probably not a good idea .
here' s what happened .
poor christy ... ... came home alone and interrupted a burglary .
sound logical ?
yeah , sure .
we have to sanitize this place .
alan .
did you have sex with her ?
i don' t know .
bill , you' re gonna have to examine her .
i' m no gynecologist .
i just made you one .
christ !
i' il take that .
it has both fingerprints .
thanks for sharing .
gloria .
gloria .
did i kill her ?
everything' s gonna be fine , alan .
don' t worry about it .
oh , god .
now be careful .
just don' t get blood on you .
i' il take care of everything , okay ?
just like i always do .
oh , shit .

madame' s purse .
miss russell , let me get him .
thank you .
i got him .

where' s the knife ?
in the bedroom .
come on .
get up there !
shit !
shit !

excuse me .
i got the number .
gee , guys , maybe it was the bogeyman .
check under the bed .
you may have buried us !
i got his license number .
you think he' il sit around waiting for us ?
look , take it easy .
everybody , shut up , all right ?
what have you got ?
oh , boy .
two way mirror .
we better get cracking on that license number .
that' s all we' ve got .
he' s got the letter opener .
blood ... ... fingerprints .
jesus !
think what he can do .
the man' s a thief .
a thief who witnessed a murder .
it looks like he stole a whole bunch of money .
i' il tell you what he' s gonna do .
he' s gonna run like hell .
they beat us by seven .
by seven ?
who' d have thought that ?
kate .
kate .
i guess it' d be a little late for me .
the jogging , i mean .
kind of dumb way to start .
but i did want to talk to you .
about ?
the weather , actually .
it' s getting cool in the evenings .
that happens this time of year .
i was thinking ... ... of moving to a kinder , more gentle climate .
i thought i' d talk with you , since you' re the only family i have .
luther , you don' t have me .
you know what it' s like to be the only kid ... ... who got to talk about visiting day ?
this move , it would be a permanent one , you understand .
we never see each other anyway .
we haven' t since mom died .
that' s a year .
look , you chose your life .
you had that right .
you were never around for me .
fine .
i have no plans to be around for you .
wait a minute .
wait .
you' re lying , aren' t you ?
are you active again ?
is that why you' re here now ?
i don' t believe you .
oh , christ !
father , what have you done ?
christy sullivan ?
wife of walter .
most likely came home , stumbled onto a burglary .
some burglary .
i wish my carpets were this clean .
i couldn' t find a single fingerprint .
are you serious , laura ?
it' s like mary poppins was here .
where' s mr. sullivan ?
sorry , seth .
the entire sullivan household went to barbados two days ago .
thanks for your support .
oh , no , wait .
it gets worse .
the shots came from here .
if she stumbled on a burglary , she should' ve been here .
but she was killed exactly where she is .
see , the blood patterns indicate that .
what is she doing here ?
looks like someone sat here , but i couldn' t find any prints .
so you think old man sullivan holed up in this chair ... ... and watched his wife perform ?
god , i hope not .
for his sake .
you know , he' s such a great man .
be careful digging that out .
looks like he tried to strangle her .
then he went to the door to shoot her from behind ?
he also inspected her vagina .
he did what ?
why ?
maybe he didn' t remember that he did her .
a strong burglar with a weak mind .
obviously , it' s another open and shut case .
we can expect tomorrow' s temperatures ... ... to climb into the 70s with lows around 50 .
turner will start things off for the cougars .
one man to beat .
he' s going all the way !
nothing but clear sailing now .
six points !
mr. sullivan .
sorry to bother you .
i' m seth frank , senior homicide detective , middletown county .
my client is in no mood for conversations .
it' s all right , sandy .
you' re in charge of the case ?
yes , sir .
i' ve gotta ask you a few questions .
what do you want ?
positive identification ?
yes ... ... that was my wife .
anything else ?
you' d been in barbados for two days .
i took the staff , always do this time of year .
your wife didn' t come with you .
well , she was .
had it all planned .
but you know women .
she changed her mind .
i' d been married to my rebecca for 47 years .
when she died ... ... i decided i never wanted that pain again .
one thing i knew about christy ... ... she was going to outlive me .
i think that' s enough for today .
sir , i have to ask you about the vault .
you mean , the contents of the vault , of course .
sandy , you go on .
walter .
no , really .
i' m all right .
you go on to the reception .
obviously , i can' t make it .
i' m sure everyone will understand .
you don' t mean the contents .
you mean the chair .
you must ask about the chair .
yes , sir .
i do .
why ?
are they connected ?
someone sat in it and may have been involved in the murder .
i have the deepest respect for you .
i' m sorry to have to do this .
i promise you , none of this will make my highlight reel .
well , i hoped i could satisfy her .
but , you know ... ... she had needs .
she didn' t want to go behind my back .
she suggested the chair .
she hoped i might get to like sitting there .
i didn' t .
for 80 years , i' ve tried to live ... ... a decent life .
i' ve given a billion dollars to charity .
if this comes to trial ... ... none of that will be remembered .
i' il just go out ... ... the joke of the world .
i understand , sir .
i' il do what i can .
would you listen to me whine ?
i apologize , mr. frank .
just do your job and i' il try to do mine .
yes , sir .
i' m sorry , sir .
ladies and gentlemen , the president .
sandy .
mr. president .
take a walk with me .
certainly , sir .
tell me about walter .
how is he ?
well , he' s 80 and alone , mr. president .
he understands that officially my hands are tied .
yes , but he' s very moved by your concern , sir .
any news of the killer ?
why isn' t there ?
who' s in charge of this ?
the top man .
he spent eight years , homicide work in new york .
i understand how you feel .
it' s hard to be patient .
no one understands how i feel .
i' m supposed to have all this power ... ... and i can' t even help my oldest friend .
you and i know , more than any man alive , walter sullivan put me here .
now when he needs me most ...
well , he must feel abandoned .
i' il have a press conference .
i' il have walter come and i' il embrace him in front of the world .
he' il treasure that .
what a generous gesture .
thank you , sir .
thank you .
tennis elbow .
this is getting worse , gloria .
i need to see a doctor .
the country would have to be informed , mr. president .
what happened to my rights to privacy ?
i think she nicked a tendon .
burton says it' s a flesh wound .
since when did you become an expert , bill ?
you ever been wounded ?
yes , sir .
a few times .
you' re serious about this press conference ?
of course i am .
walter' s like a father to me .
shall i bring mrs. richmond home ?
i don' t think mrs. richmond' s mission ... ... to help the poor in asia needs to be interrupted .
what do we know so far ?
we' ve checked his license plates .
he stole the car from a police impoundment lot .
we' re not dealing with a fool , are we ?
has he initiated contact ?
burton doesn' t think he will .
i agree .
i apologize for my behavior .
consider it a blip on the screen .
as far as i' m concerned , that' s all he is .
he could be a little more than that , alan .
he saw .
he saw nothing .
he saw a drunk woman who liked rough sex too much .
he' s a burglar .
who' s gonna believe him ?
after all , it' s not as if he has any evidence .
he' s a burglar .
who ' s gonna believe him ?
after all , it' s not as if he has any evidence .
boy , you always did disappear good , luther .
you' re trying to say i have a weak face ?
no , i' m saying you' re lucky .
some customers , no matter what i do , still stand out .
how many passports you want ?
four ought to do the trick .
you want different looks , matching international driver' s licenses .
i' il throw in dummy credit cards .
how are the rugs i made you holding up ?
good .
the mustaches and the beards also .
we try to give quality for our money .
you leaving the country for permanent ?
that could be .
does it matter where you' ve been ?
i hate doing asian passport stamps .
no .
make it european .
caribbean in the wintertime .
how long is all this gonna take ?
it usually takes time .
for you , i' il rush it .
you' re always dependable , valerie .
listen , luther ... ... i don' t wanna know what you' re into .
i do , but i' m not gonna ask you .
but leaving the country forever ...
what is it ?
i never figured you for a runner .
thirty percent of my runners kill themselves within five years .
right now , five years doesn' t sound too bad .
take care .
see you .
okay , see if this makes any sense .
i am christy sullivan .
i come in and i surprise a burglar .
okay , now you' re the surprised burglar coming from the vault .
gold star .
i draw my gun .
boom .
then why strangle her when you could just shoot her ?
why do i bother to strip her and put her clothes back on ?
there , i can help you out .
you used to be a dry cleaner and you love beautiful clothes .
thanks a lot .
and you dress her because ...
she was a good customer and you didn' t want her embarrassed when police came .
she had a 0 . 21 blood alcohol level .
not that it matters .
she didn' t drive .
the chauffeurs , they keep exact mileage on these cars .
they haven' t been driven since they went to barbados .
i checked every cab and limo service in the area .
somebody drove her home .
who ?
why haven' t they come forward ?
maybe because whoever drove her home killed her .
maybe .
i love this case .
lieutenant ?
sorry to bother you , but the phone problems ?
i took care of them .
thanks .
just part of the job .
i hate people who say that .
it is your fucking job .
remember the bullet hole in the wall ?
guess what ?
no slug .
why take a slug out of the wall when there' s one stuck in her head ?
different from the one in her body ?
two different guns means two burglars .
two guys broke in ?
they both went out the window ?
bullshit .
by the way ... ... why did he or they go out the window anyway ... ... when he or they got in by breaking a zillion dollar security system ?
bill burton from secret service in the parking lot .
thanks , bob .
what' s he doing in the parking lot ?
bill burton .
hi .
hi .
seth frank .
to what do i owe the honor ?
you must be going crazy ... ... but the boss is interested about your progress .
maybe we could help each other .
what do you have in mind ?
well , you know how close he and sullivan are , right ?
the minute anything breaks ... ... i' il tell the president .
he' d be the first to alert mr. sullivan .
it' d mean a lot to him .
any red tape you want cut , done .
here' s my numbers .
any leads ?
we' re still figuring out what happened .
i love playing sherlock holmes .
you guys do that ?
i was a state trooper before the government got me .
wait .
you' re that bill burton ?
i was younger and dumber then .
i was younger .
i' m dumber now .
keep in touch .
my chef makes them especially for me .
i promise you , they' re sinful .
you' re a salesman , mr. sullivan .
this is a new arena for me .
but from what i' m told , you have a flawless reputation .
which is why i need to employ you , mr. mccarty .
understood .
i don' t know who it is i' m after yet .
until i do ... ... you wait in washington for instructions .
that' s out of the question .
mine is not creative work .
i do it because i enjoy living beyond my means .
i can' t afford to sit around .
my father died when i was 10 years old .
he was a miner .
he died of lung disease .
i became rich at 25 .
the first thing i did was buy that mine , close it down ... ... and give every miner $50, 000 to retire on .
you will wait in washington , mr. mccarty .
and i will put one million dollars ' expenses ... ... in a swiss bank of your choosing .
and when the time comes ... ... 2 million dollars a bullet .
you are a salesman , sir .
selling sin is easy .
who is he ?
it' s luther whitney ... ... one of the great thieves of the world .
i' ve been going nuts .
i was up all night .
i remembered your notion how it was two burglars .
around dawn , i thought , " what if it' s not two burglars ... ... but just one guy trying to make it look like two ?
i called my buddy at the bureau .
they keep track .
there' s only half a dozen guys who could' ve done the sullivan job .
i' ve been tracing all six .
whitney' s the only guy that lives here .
why haven' t i ever heard of him ?
he hasn' t been arrested in 30 years .
what' s this ?
his graduation picture from harvard ?
that' s history .
he was just a punk , part of a gang .
three time loser .
since he got out last ... ... no one' s touched him .
when something big comes up , they question him , but nothing sticks .
oh , seth .
we can make this stick .
i bet you he' s our guy .
he' s a local .
you can' t ask for anything more .
well , we got a problem .
what ?
he hasn' t killed anyone in 45 years .
korea .
so what ?
he' s a veteran .
not just a veteran , he' s a wounded veteran .
i got his war record here .
battles , commendations , decorations up the kazoo .
he lives alone on disability .
that' s what he says anyway .
but i don' t see him as a killer .
he' s just a great thief .
and besides , i don' t do war heroes .
boy , you must be smart .
pardon me ?
it usually takes you guys a week to get to me .
oh , seth frank .
i recognize your picture from the newspaper .
luther whitney .
nice to meet you .
would you like a signed confession now or do you want coffee first ?
before i send you away for life , i should probably check out your alibi .
i was watching a football game with an old friend , red bransford .
he owns a saloon here in town .
you can ask me about the game .
i could be lying .
you been following the case ?
yeah , i have .
i love true crime .
fbi says there' s only a few guys who could have handled this job .
i got a list here .
you' re on it .
how i wish it were true .
this person , they go in the front door ... ... and out a window , down a rope in the middle of the night ?
now , if i could do something like that ... ... i' d be the star of my aarp meetings .
what' s that ?
the american ...
association of retired persons .
luther , why was this so difficult ?
you want me to help you solve your case ?
just looking for insight .
how would you ... ?
scratch that .
how would one go about it ?
what kind of person should i look for ?
except for the rope trick , an older person , like me .
because ?
well , you need patience .
the secret is research , research and research .
i' ve read that .
what kind of research ?
well , from what i saw on the tube , this is a rather large home .
must be an architectural office .
you' d go to the library , go through public records ... ... find out where that architectural office is and break in .
and then you xerox the plans and get them back by morning .
why not just steal them ?
anyone can break into an office , but doing it ... ... without having people know you were there is the trick .
then there' s the general contractor .
and then there' s the security company .
do you realize the skill of breaking the security of a security company ?
i don' t know how those guys do it .
why go to all that trouble , luther ?
there' s a vault in the house .
there must be a secret way into it .
there was .
that' s what i don' t get .
how do you mean ?
this guy obviously did the research you' re talking about .
so why does he take a crowbar ... ... to open the vault when there' s a clicker right there ?
a clicker ?
well , a gizmo , like a vcr remote .
sounds amazing to me .
must' ve been a lot of valuables in that vault .
close to 5 million total value .
is that funny ?
i feel like you' re trying to surprise me .
i was trying to .
thank you .
you' re welcome .
there you go again .
would the burglar use a disguise ?
yeah , he might .
get with the program if you' re gonna catch this guy .
it is a guy we think , anyway .
some sort of a loner ?
weirdo ?
maybe like you .
well , i' d be the perfect prototype , actually .
except you see a face around long enough and put things together .
that' s why these top guys have disguises .
some of them , i even understand , become makeup experts ... ... hire wigmakers and things like that .
go on about the wigmakers .
i would ...
i' ve gotta go have my pacemaker checked .
it' s been so exciting talking to you .
you don' t have a pacemaker .
i' il be back tomorrow .
tomorrow is promised to no one .
goodbye .
pacemaker , my ass .
oh , katie .
you gotta start eating better than this , darling .
i' m having this press conference here ... ... because it is here , at this courthouse ... ... that christine sullivan' s killer will be tried .
as you know , i came from an impoverished family ... ... in an impoverished town .
we lived with our doors ... ... unlocked .
we all lock our doors now .
that' s not what concerns me .
a ginger ale .
we are also locking our hearts .
could you turn that off ?
that is the sadness .
in a second .
that ... ... is the loss .
we are locking our hearts to the weary .
we are locking our hearts ... ... to the poor and their pain .
sisters and brothers ... ... we are locking our hearts to ourselves .
turn it back on .
but you said ...
i know ... ... but turn it on .
we feel that savagery and violence must be allowed a place at table .
that is wrong .
that is not america .
i shall fight that battle .
dear friend ... ... old friend ...
... we shall fight that battle .
who can explain chance ?
if we had not met ... ... i would not be president today .
if christine had not taken ill ... ... she would be with you in barbados even now .
walter , you' ve been like a father to me .
i would give the world to lessen your pain .
thank you .
you heartless whore .
i' m not about to run from you .
thomas jefferson used the green room as a dining room .
the walls are covered with green silk ... ... just as they were when james monroe was president .
many valuable objects and paintings in this room .
we' il move on to the blue room .
james hoban built the blue room as an oval ... ... to please president washington .
during the holiday season ... ... the white house christmas tree stands in the middle .
the view from the window includes the jefferson memorial .
we' il be moving on to the red room .
the walls of the red room are covered with red silk .
he was in the building .
he took a guided tour .
i' ve never dealt with blackmail before .
he doesn' t want money .
you' re a mind reader too now .
no , i just looked on the back .
see ?
i don' t want money .
he has the guts of a burglar .
wish we had him .
finished your recruiting speech ?
because i' d like to know how i handle this .
like you handled the letter opener ?
gee , bill ... ... that could be construed as criticism .
you want me for an enemy ?
i should' ve called the police that night but i was weak .
you convinced me to stay silent .
i regret that .
every time i see your face , i wanna rip your throat out .
fine .
you win the pissing contest .
what do i do ?
nothing .
he' s making a mistake .
he thinks he has time .
he doesn' t .
seth frank' s too good .
he' il bring him in .
then what ?
then i kill him .
miss whitney ?
thanks .
miss whitney ?
i' m seth frank .
excuse me .
thanks .
for a tough prosecutor , you sure don' t resemble your reputation .
is that good or bad ?
i don' t know .
look , lieutenant , i told you on the phone .
i' m not involved with my father .
so this is a waste of time .
do you expect me to walk out of here ?
all right .
all right .
your father disappeared .
i need your help .
look .
lieutenant , i don' t know the man .
he was in jail .
when he got out , my mom and i lived by ourselves .
he doesn' t care about me .
i' ve seen him once this past year .
yeah , when ?
a few days ago .
he said he might leave town .
i helped you .
can i work now ?
any idea where he went ?
quit wasting my time .
he doesn' t want you to find him , you won' t .
you' re saying he skipped the country ?
i' m saying you won' t recognize him .
he could be right around the corner .
he always had a safe house .
where ?
he never said .
how do you know he had one ?
my mother loved him , all right ?
even after she left him , when she was dying , he was all she talked about .
if only he hadn' t done this .
lf only he hadn' t done that . " what else ?
how long has he lived here ?
years .
never been .
this is a strange place for a thief to leave a key .
he always did that .
he left in a hurry .
i wonder what scares a professional thief like that .
he wasn' t at these places .
my college graduation ... ... my law school graduation , the night my mother and i ... ... we went out to celebrate because i' d gotten my first job .
me alone on the steps .
i' d won my first case .
i used to think sometimes ...
sometimes i' d come home and could sense that he' d been in the apartment .
that he' d checked the fridge , shook his head because i never ate right .
i mean , i know it sounds crazy , but i' ve always ...
i' ve always felt that he was around .
you can do a good thing .
help me bring him in .
leave a message you' re worried about him .
no .
it' s true .
you' re worried .
this is no normal case .
his life is in danger .
you call , you could save him .
he won' t come .
of course he' il come .
you' re all he has .
he' s on the run and he' s scared because he' il get caught .
you don' t know the heat .
he' s not a murderer .
maybe he is innocent .
if that' s true , i' il have him home in a few hours .
what if a hotshot trying to make a reputation tracks him down ?
i can guarantee his safety .
you make the call , i' il make a promise .
you' il have him back .
seth frank .
hi .
i left a message on his machine .
he called me back within the hour and i' m meeting him tomorrow .
where ?
open air place near my office , cafe alonzo .
what time ?
four o ' clock .
it' il be deserted then .
sounds good .
thanks a lot .
bye .
bye bye .
dad , hi .
it' s kate calling .
i was wondering if you could call me , please .
there' s some things i' d like to talk with you about ... ... and maybe even get together , if that' s possible .
okay ?
thanks and talk to you soon .
bye .
dad , hi .
it' s kate calling .
i was wondering if you could call me , please .
there' s some things i' d like to talk with you about ... ... and maybe even get together .
so you all know where and when you' re supposed to be there .
he' s slippery .
he' s an eel .
he gets a whiff of a cop , he disappears .
nobody moves until i order you .
then we move in on him .
expect whitney to show up at 4 .
his daughter will be waiting for him .
it' s important to stay in your positions ... ... until you hear the order to move in on him .
here you go .
could i have some cream ?
gather around , gentlemen .
nobody moves till the suspect' s in place .
any questions ?
see you at the alonzo .
boss is grateful .
he' d appreciate an eyewitness at the capture .
this is our guy .
if he isn' t , he sure disappeared fast .
see you there .
tums ?
i got my own .
come on , kate .
she gonna show ?
yeah , she' il be here .
miss ?
what you want , please ?
nothing .
thank you .
got to .
pardon ?
you sit , you eat , please .
jeez , this guy wasn' t part of my master plan .
unbelievable .
i' m waiting for someone .
oh , he must eat too , please .
he will .
we will .
we' re gonna ...
we' il order half the menu .
just not now .
maybe that' s him disguised as a chinaman .
check out this guy in the hat .
i believe that' s our man .
all units , suspect' s approaching .
stay in place .
wait for my signal .
i did not kill her .
i want you to believe that .
just hold on .
let him get settled .
you' ve gotta believe that .
i think we' re ready .
damn it !
almost .
you okay ?
what was that ?
anyone see where those came from ?
did you do that ?
no , we didn' t do it !
anyone see where those shots came from ?
where' s whitney ?
quit standing around here !
go find him !
take it easy .
take it easy .
take it easy , now .
stay calm .
stay calm .
there' s no reason to panic .
if everyone will just kindly take it easy .
messy .
i like that in a woman .
here .
i got a few numbers here .
the top one' s ... ... iocal police .
that' s my office , my home , beeper .
i live alone too .
you can call anytime .
want me to get someone to stay here ?
no , i wanna get some sleep .
surveillance is outside until it' s over .
i' ve got a feeling he' il contact you .
you' re on a hot streak , i guess .
listen , i' m sorry .
anything unusual at all ... ... call right away .
it' s not a bother .
i live alone .
you said .
feeble .
you want something for the road ?
i got water and water .
deal .
a pellegrino would be great .
what' s so funny ?
i say it wrong ?
i' m tired .
i' m just tired .
listen ... ... there' s one thing ... ... i forgot to tell you .
i live alone .
lock up behind me .
how' s that ?
real good .
now get some sleep .
thank you .
i betrayed you twice , luther .
you should know that .
you' re not the first .
why' d you come ?
i can' t have my daughter thinking i was a murderer .
no , i mean this afternoon .
why' d you come ?
you suspected something or you wouldn' t have prepared .
my daughter wanted to see me .
the robbery was going fine until they came in .
they were drunk .
i was hidden in the vault .
and the sex had started getting rough ... ... and he started beating her ... ... started strangling her .
i thought he' d kill her .
then she somehow got the upper hand .
she was gonna stab him with a letter opener and two guys shot her .
the same two guys who tried for you today .
possibly .
unless walter sullivan was taking a shot .
it' s a pretty powerful enemy .
that' s very good going .
not as powerful as the president of the united states .
that' s right .
alan richmond , he was the drunk .
the two guys were secret service .
chief of staff russell handled the cover up .
well , then you go to the police .
that' s what innocent people do .
they go to the police .
sure .
that young man who was here ... ... he' d believe me over the president , right ?
why should i believe you ?
because i swear to you , kate .
i swear to you on mattie' s grave .
that' s right .
your mother' s grave .
i' d kill myself before i' d lie about that .
oh , jesus , luther .
yeah .
i know .
they' il kill you .
i know .
can you run ?
i was all set to .
i was at the airport ready to go .
then there was that press conference .
and there was richmond using old man sullivan .
you know , i might not have been able to ... ... save christy sullivan ... ... but i didn' t even try .
what are you gonna do ?
i' il think of something .
i watched you argue a case last year .
you won it .
thank god you got your mother' s brains .
dangerous outside .
it always is .
excuse me .
could you give this to gloria russell ?
anything for me to sign ?
no , you have an honest face .
oh , my god .
you' re a vision tonight .
thank you , mr. president .
and thank you , mr. president .
for ... ?
come again .
you know .
you sent it to me this afternoon .
of course .
would you excuse me , all ?
i' m overcome with a desire to dance with my chief of staff .
look after this for me , would you ?
what is this nonsense ?
i' m hoping there' s an explanation .
your gift , alan .
i was ... ... overwhelmed .
and , you know , your note was so gratifying .
i sent a note ?
yes , yes .
you think i don' t know your writing ?
i assumed you wanted me to wear it tonight .
gloria , it' s lovely .
yes .
and you know what else ?
what , alan ?
christy wore it the night she was killed .
know what this means ?
no .
whitney' s been heard from .
it' s not precisely the first time .
you been keeping things from me ?
well , it' s just that you have so much on your plate .
we wanted to spare you .
he sent me a polaroid ... ... of the letter opener yesterday .
i have to give this some thought .
come to my office in the morning .
this' il make an interesting chapter in my memoirs .
do we know who the forger is ?
i talked to seth frank .
apparently , whitney learned how in prison .
a gifted man .
how close are we to him ?
we' re working around the clock .
well , that' s good to know .
he' il make a mistake .
well , that' s good to know too .
there is ... ... one other thing ... ... that we need to take care of .
he has a daughter , doesn' t he ?
you sure you wanna do that ?
sir ?
she' s a young prosecutor .
prosecutors ask questions .
maybe she knows what he knows .
let' s get cracking , boys .
show that you love your country .
how' s kate doing ?
where are you ?
i won' t hang around for you to trace the call .
just answer the question .
she couldn' t be in better hands .
secret service is taking over surveillance .
hello ?
hello ?
it' s entered in the chart .
we upped her from 250 to 500 milligrams .
nurse , i need you right away , please .
he' s having a seizure .
dr. kevorkian , i presume .
my guess is that this is right in your carotid artery about now .
you' re gonna get a little woozy .
but if i give you the rest ... ... it' il fry your brain down to the size of a peanut .
drop that .
luther ... ... he was my president .
right or wrong .
well , he made a mistake .
you made a mistake .
when you went after my girl , that was entirely unacceptable .
mercy .
i' m fresh out .
daddy ?
go to sleep , darling .
oh , jesus !
just one question .
did walter sullivan say why christy didn' t go to barbados ?
just that she changed her mind .
you know who did it , don' t you ?
so will you .
check your phones .
good night , mr. sullivan .
you' re taking a shortcut , tommy ?
i' m your substitute driver tonight .
don' t worry about tommy .
he' s fine .
very unusual .
what do i call you ?
luther , sir .
and are you familiar with how to get to my townhouse , luther ?
oh , yes , sir .
i know where all your houses are .
i' m the man who robbed you .
you' re the man who tried to kill me .
i' m sorry i missed .
i believe in the old testament , sir .
there' s nothing wrong with an eye for an eye ... ... when a terrible deed is done .
a deed such as yours .
you' d like to believe that .
that' d be simple for you to believe that .
what do i have to gain by being here ?
i have no idea .
you going to rob me again ?
i don' t need your money , mr. sullivan .
did you check your vault lately ?
i put everything back .
i' m afraid we' re a little late for an attempt at leniency .
a lot of crap' s coming down tonight , sir .
you wanna be a player or not ?
you wanna know what happened or don' t you ?
because i was there .
i want to know .
you think you can stand hearing about it ?
how he beat her , tried to strangle her ?
you really wanna know ?
i could walk through fire .
i was in the vault when they came in .
they were drunk .
he knocked her around .
she fought back .
he got really rough .
she tried to defend herself .
well , he started screaming ... ... sniveling simp he is .
who else was in my house ?
secret service .
they' re the ones who shot her .
nonsense .
gloria russell handled the cover up .
stop this !
you wanna know who it was ?
it was you .
come on , mr. sullivan .
we' re too old to bullshit each other .
who was it , then ?
you know .
don' t shake your head .
when you' re alone and rage takes over and you want revenge ... ... what face do you put with your enemy ?
stop the car !
we' re going straight ahead .
this is too terrible .
yes , it is .
i know about alan' s reputation as a philanderer ... ... but he' d never dream of betraying me .
i gave him the presidency .
remember that press conference ?
where he put his arm around you and said ... ... if christy hadn' t been sick , she' d have been in barbados with you ?
how the hell did he know she was sick ?
you didn' t tell anyone .
it' s because she told him that night .
i was right there watching .
that' s not real proof .
well , maybe this is , then .
you could' ve stolen this .
i did steal it .
but that' s not my blood on there and that' s not my prints .
mr. sullivan .
i did love her , you know .
jeez , burton .
is he working late ?
i don' t have an appointment but i want to see him .
you don' t need an appointment .
let' s go , miss russell .
walter .
come in .
we interrupt with a breaking story ... ... that' s shocking the nation and the world .
information just came from the white house about a tragedy within the hour .
we go now to our correspondent .
diane , what can you tell us ?
sources tell us walter sullivan had seen president richmond tonight .
that was for an unscheduled private meeting .
you' re still here .
i' m still here .
... i would not be president .
if christine had not taken ill ... ... she would be with you in barbados even now .
walter , you' ve been like a father to me .
this is the president' s most recent news conference ... ... where he clearly outlined ... ... his loyalty to philanthropist and friend , sullivan .
the president vowed to find sullivan ' s wife' s killer .
sullivan had a meeting with the president .
unknown what they discussed .
now to the white house for a live interview .
have you no idea why the president would take his own life ?
i know he' s been feeling the pressure of office , more than ever , lately .
he talked about it a great deal .
but why would he stab himself ?
that' s a question that will haunt me forever .
of course i tried to stop him .
alan ... ... was like a son to me .
was that seth ?
i think he' d like to come over for supper when you get well .
you don' t have to fuss .
i know .
am i gonna be all right ?
yeah .
we' re gonna be just fine .
