you know , some folks believe everyone has a public life , a private life and a secret life .
what do you think about that ?
see , the thing is , i guess ...
my secret life is a bit less secret than anyone else' s right now .
hey , mahowny , you got a promotion , eh ?
yup .

good morning .
good morning .
miss selkirk .
congratulations .
mr. mahowny has just become the branch' s youngest assistant manager .
i see .
he' s been handling
miss selkirk' s accounts and trading interests for some time .
well , perhaps we could ... get started , then .
are you telling me that the bank would be happy to lend the money to my father , but has reservations about lending it to me ?
we' d just be happier if selkirk international was involved as security .
i thought security was ...
the building itself , with miss selkirk' s bond holdings making up the balance .
in addition to which you have my client' s personal guarantee .
even so , with such a large line of credit ...
sir .
i' m sorry you had to go through that , miss selkirk .
what was on that sheet ?
i thought he should know how much we' re making off you .
dan !
you actually make banking fun .
it' s all about procedure .
just have to know your way around it .
well , i am very grateful .
one of these days , i' m gonna take you out and get you a decent suit .
bye bye .
bye .
see ya .
bye .
are you sure he can handle a loan of this size at his age ?
oh absolutely .
he has an impeccable record and excellent judgement .
what are you doing here ?
we got a little concerned when you didn' t show .
we thought maybe you were sick or something ...
this is not the race track .
how much you got for us ?
i told you , i need a day or two .
that was on monday , dan , this is friday .
look , guys , i' m having a bad run , so what ?
just give me 5, 000 more ...
five thousand more ? !

look after yourself or i' m gonna have to do it for you .
what are you saying ?
that we' re gonna have to come up with a payment plan where you give me a certain amount of money on a certain day and until you' re paid up , you do not play !
you can' t do that .
i can do it , i' m doing it now .
i thought we had a relationship here .

well , we' ve never been down to atlantic city .
right .
we should do that some time .
it' s clubs , dan .
north carolina hanging on ...

mr. mahowny .
victor foss .
i just want you to know that my casino is your casino .
i set aside a table at la gioconde so you can sample our excellent european cuisine .
thank you .
perhaps you' d prefer the hyakida steakhouse ?
uh , barbecued ribs would be good , with no sauce and a coke .
mr. mahowny would like barbecued ribs , no sauce and a coke .
thank you .
mr. mahowny , your new room key .
hey , dan .
danny , listen man , forget the tables ; you won' t want to keep playing when you see our room !
yeah , it' s courtesy of the casino .

jesus !
that' s gotta be at least ...
forty grand .
forty grand !

i don' t want him interrupted , take them back .
and tell them to make some more .
i want ' em on permanent standby , is that understood ?
doug , give me my money .
what ?
give me my money .
dan , you told me not to , remember ?
i' ve changed my mind .
you brought a curse to that table , you know that ?
give me my money and stay away from me .
come on , man , i can' t let you do this .
we' re talking 40 grand !
forty grand of my money .
you gotta calm down , walk outta here now and think this through .
for the last time , give me my money and stay away from me .
okay .
fine .
fine .
come on , dan .
what ?
what are you doing ? !
what ? !
you lost your way , or something ?
yeah .
yup , yup .
yup .
hey , hey , take it easy , man .
uh , you want a rib ?
we got plenty , but , uh , no sauce .
i' m putting you on the floor .
you' re kiddin ' !
i wish i was .
bernie , isn' t it ?
um , yes sir .
that guy you found in the stairwell ,
mr. ribs , he likes you .
and you' re gonna stick to him .
uh , sir , i ...
i didn' t do nothing .
well , then , don' t do nothing again .
now get out of my office before i change my mind !
yes sir !
and thank you very much , sir .
i won' t let you down .
i won' t let you down .
thank you .
hey .
hey .
you okay ?
where' s the washroom ?
uh , there , there and there .
okay .
so where' s danny boy ?
he' s busy .
what , he doesn' t eat lunch ?
work always comes first with dan .
except when he' s at the track .
he doesn' t go that often .
belinda , you told me yourself !
you' ve got no idea how hard he works .
anyone who works as hard as he does has a right to do what he wants with his disposable income .
you got that bank draft for me , teri ?
bank draft ?
from the selkirk loan account .
selkirk ...
um , there is so much activity on that account , i can' t keep up .
i know the feeling .
oh , yeah , here we are .
i' m acting for investors looking for short term security .
you' ve come to the right place .
i was thinking of bearer bonds ?
that' s not a bad idea .
bonds are secure .
great way of moving money around fast .
okay , so would you like me to open up an account for you right now ?
yeah , uh , 200, 000 in the name of roger oskaner .
okay .
hey , you see those bluejays on monday night ?
seven to five ?
those guys are hot .
oh boy , here comes trouble .
big trouble .
let me guess , selkirk ?
nope , oskaner .
oh , oskaner .
he wants to sell bonds at market rate .
mahowny .
banker !
yeah , uh ... where ... where have you been ?
i called four times already .
so you wanna hear the lines ?
hold on .
hey , banker , you there ?
what the fuck ? !
uh ...
i can' t do this now .
you' re not playing today ?
give me all the home teams in the national , and all the away teams in the american .
you' re kidding ?
uh , every game for the $1, 000 max .
you' re the man .
the selkirk account seems to be moving at incredible speed .
perhaps we should find out what their schedule is , and advise regional office .
uh , you know , a higher line of credit would be a lot simpler .
okay , good idea .
keep her sweet , dan .
right .
you' ve opened a loan account for pembro trading ?
finally , yes .
i thought they' d run into partnership problems .
i guess things are rolling .
uh , the documentation was all in place ; you approved it yourself .
okay .
and ...
jake arnold .
jake arnold , same thing .
how long ago did we authorize credit ?
two years .
and he' s never borrowed against it until now ?
no , but he could have .
it' s strange ; you know , i think he set the whole thing up just so he could tell his friends he had a million dollar credit line .
maybe business got bad .
maybe he won' t be handing out jars of peanuts this christmas .
he really does that ?
sure .
even his , uh ... desk is peanut shaped .
you' re kidding ?
no .
what a guy .
yeah , what a nut .
good work , dan .
thank you , bill .
roger oskaner .
what' s the problem ?
an interest payment overdue .
no problem , he' s selling bonds today .
he stopped by to sign the order and pick up his cash .
he did ?
i missed him again ?
jeez .
i' m gonna have to start bagging lunch , see if i can lay eyes on this guy .
he' s a goddamn phantom .
oskaner the phantom .
dan !
you picked one hell of a night .
the pointer sisters are in town .
wanna see the show , just let me know .
thank you .
anything you need right now ?
well , uh ... maybe later i might have some ribs .
oh , of course .
and bernie' s right here to take care of you .
' evening , mr. m.
ready when you are .
ribs , the man wants ribs .
hello ?
hi , dan .
hi .
uh ...
i think there' s been a mistake .
dan , i am no mistake .
now why don' t you slide right on over here and keep me company .
hello ?
he told her that he was only interested in lady luck .
no sex , no booze , no drugs ... our little roller is a purist .
he' s a goddamn thoroughbred .
all he cares about is the next hand .
he' s a beauty .
he' s a beauty !
i love him .
i love him !
the iceman .
you know , i was thinking ...
you know , we could get away .
go away for a weekend , or something .
just you and me .
yeah ?
yeah , jump on a plane .
go anywhere .
are you serious ?
yes .
' cause i' d really like that .
and there are some really great deals going this time of year .
great , i' il look into it , all right ?
i promise .
maybe somewhere hot ?
somewhere hot .
okay ?
okay .
give me all the home teams , every game , both saturday and sunday .
uh , you want the cfl too ?
all the underdogs .
every game ?
yeah .
i won' t be around this weekend , tell frank i want the one horse in every race , both tracks .
every race ?
you don' t even know who' s running !
for the maximum .
i' il see you monday .
i don' t know if frank' il cover you on this one .
i' m sure he will .
have a nice weekend , mrs. quinson .
and when are you gonna get married ?
ma , don' t bother my friends !
i hate it when he makes stupid bets .
why not ?
it' s disrespectful to my business and to me .
yeah , but frank , it' s easy money .
i' il take his action if he' il play for real .
that way i feel better about taking his money .
yeah !
ha !
ha !
ha !
he' s probably mad at me .
they all get mad at you .
they lose , and it' s your fault , you know .
very fucked up .
maybe we should get mad at them .
yeah , maybe we should .
maybe we should .
maybe we should .
you know ... you know why he wants to win ?
why ?
so he has the money to keep losing .
now how fucked up is that ?
huh !
so you wanna get heavy ?
nah , let' s leave it the way it is .
he enjoys it , you know .
he enjoys seeing me every monday .
it' s important to him .
anyway , so there' s something i want you to get ...
you got enough to shut him down ?
yeah , maybe .
but frank perlin' s nothing , jim .
i wanna ...
i wanna tap into his whole network .
you got authorization for a tail yet ?
yeah .
so how much more do you need from me ?
you know how much bell charges for this stuff here ?
that' s 50 bucks a line .
you got this whole sweet operation going on here .
what do you give me ?
uh , nothing relevant .
nothing relevant .
oh , look !
nothing relevant !
i want names , jim .
names !
hey , girl .

i' il see you monday .
is that your girlfriend ?
you leave her out of this .
she' s pretty .
you kids take care of yourselves .
all right .
we should go to the gate .
who were they ?
just some friends of mine from the track .
i don' t think you should be seen with people like that , dan .
you work in a bank , they might damage your prospects .
just forget about it .
it' s not gonna spoil our weekend .
steve , i got a name here for you .
dan mahowny .
have that checked out for me ?
yeah , i will .

i' m on a roll here .
ma' am , could you step away from the table , please ?

come on , this is your call .
let' s do it .
you can do it , man .
looking for a seven or eleven .
seven !
beautiful , beautiful .
beautiful .
everybody loses in vegas .
what do you mean , no record ?
i mean , like nothing .
not even ... a jaywalking ticket ?
the only unusual thing about him is how many .
how many what ?
well , if you move the letters of his name around , it spells how many .
mahowny how many .
uh , you don' t say .
i' il file a report .
he works in a bank .
maybe perlin' s got plans for him .
laundering money and stuff ?
you know anything about the banking business , steve ?
i guess not .
i got a brother in law used to work in that bank ... that' s ten years ago , but ... you gotta ask permission to get married .
no way .
you think we got a lot of regulations ?
yes , i do , as a matter of fact .
he makes 22, 000 a year canadian .
so he' s some trust fund punk ?
no .
where the hell does he get all the money ?
i don' t know .
the usual ?
drugs ? !
no way .
you have to see this guy .
well , i got a little theory going .
it' s kind of what you might call a long shot , but i think that ...
yeah ?
excuse me , sir , but i thought you might like to know ... that mr. mahowny has left vegas .
what ?
already ?
he' s transferred 250, 000 to our cage ...
he' s taken the rest back with him to toronto .
he won ?
yes .
you could definitely call this a win .
so ... he' s gonna come back .
and he' s loaded .
what' s this man doing in my office ?
who is this man ?
pay him , and get him outta here .
and find that kid i fired .
bernie ?
yeah .
tell him he' s got his job back .
dan ?
oh , i' m really sorry .
for what , exactly ?
i ...
i never meant to leave you alone .
i ...
i tried to find you but you' d left and i ...
and i guess i just missed you .
i ...
it' s okay , i understand .
you do ?
you gotta do what you gotta do .
i know you can' t help yourself , dan .
you got a gambling problem and we are gonna deal with this together .
no , blin , you don' t understand .
no , i' ve been reading up about this , and the first thing you gotta do is admit it to yourself .
blin , you got things wrong .
just say it , dan .
if you just say it !
i don' t have a gambling problem .
do you think i' m an idiot ? !
i have a ... a financial problem .
you owe money ?
yes .
to the men at the airport ?
yes .
and i know what i' m doing .
all right ?
you gotta trust me .
please .
i have $2, 000 in my savings account .
if i cash in my retirement plan , it' s another 3, 000 .
will that help ?
will that make us into a normal couple ?
how much do you owe , for chrissakes ?
twenty thousand ?
where did you get that number ?
i made it up !
look , blin , i ...
i know i' ve not been here for you lately , but things are different now .
i ...
i had a great run last night , and that guy at the airport ,
i can pay him back in full .
and then what ?
things will be different .
did we go to vegas so you could clear a gambling debt ?
' cause you know why i thought we went there ?
i mean , when i saw the room and everything ...
i mean , what was i supposed to think ?
why do people go to vegas ?
i thought we were gonna get married !
i mean , that' s what normal people do in vegas .
it' s not how i' d have planned it , but if you' d asked , i' d have said ... yes .
i' m sorry .
i' m ... sorry .
do you want me to leave ?
how ya doin ' , banker ?
so you have a good time in vegas ?
not bad .
yeah ?
you don' t look good .

something like that .
thank you .

these audits can be a pain ; we will try staying out of the way .
uh , i was in audits myself .
so you know the drill ?
yeah .
how long do you think it' il take ?
ten days .
maybe eight .
so , ten days of this ?
maybe eight .
it' s late this year , isn' t it ?
the blizzard ?
no , the audit .
everyone' s so jumpy .
well , it has to be done , blin .
there' s something missing here .
the oskaner file .
i only have a statement and one memo .
dan tends to handle that one himself .
hmm .
no manager' s approval , no details of security .
this ... client doesn' t even seem to have an address .
ah , the phantom .
excuse me ?
i can' t help you .
you' re gonna have to ask dan about oskaner .
there' s one audit i heard about , out west .
the bank' s only security system was an alarm that rang in the hotel next door .
did they test it ?
uh , of course .
what happened ?
the waiter showed up with a tray of beer .
ah , well .
about the uh , oskaner account .
what do you need to know ?
there' s no way i can pass this .
for what reason ?
for a start , he' s way over his credit limit .
no authorization ...
it was paid off .
it was ?
in full .
he sold bonds today .
well , fine .
that' s that one done .
i' m really trying to motor , here , you know ?
we' re two branches behind .
whatever i can do to help .
no pressure , dan .
we are looking for a strike .
straight down the middle .
oh , dan !
oh , dan !
oh , dan , no !
not so bad !
okay , folks , uh ...
i gotta go .
no !
we were gonna treat you both at swiss chalet !
swiss chalet ?
oh , i love swiss chalet .
i' m sorry .
oh , it' s okay .
all right .
can i count on you , sir , to make sure the little lady gets home safe ?
i think we can manage that .
you go off and do what you have to do .
thank you , sir .
see you at home .
don' t you even want to know the scores ?
sir , check your pockets ?
wow .
sir , step over here , please .
arms up to the side .
okay , go ahead .
we' re landing in philadelphia very shortly .
might have left the snow in toronto , but you don' t wanna know what the weather' s like down there right now .
hey , man .
you looking for a ride ?
i can take care of you .
no , thank you .
come on , man .
you wait all night for a cab ?
i' m ready to roll , man .
why are we on the highway ?
i need to make a stop .
no stops !
it' s kind of an emergency .
i ...
i don' t care if it' s an emergency , no stops !
open the door .
hey , come on !
come on !
what are you doing , man ?
what are doing ?
hey !
hey !
gimme my car back , man !
let me take care of your travel .
starting tonight .
too many people around here know i carry cash .
i don' t like it .
i don' t like people knowing my business .
i don' t like it .
we can solve this problem very easily .
all you have to do is take the funds to your bank , and they' il wire it through to our bank into an american account .
there' d be personal i. d. requirements , tax stuff .
no .
i' il look into alternatives .
excuse me , mr. foss .
oh boy .
lock up the money .
hey , where' s he going ?
hey , you' re not playing tonight , mr. m ?
sure , i' m gonna play , bernie .
i , uh , just needed some air .
yeah .
i' ve never been out here before , so ...
well , uh , you know , that' s on account of the windows .
see , the glass is tinted , so it always looks dull outside .
hmm .
you know , some dude told me they pump in oxygen .
keep you guys high .
huh .
that makes sense .
yeah .
right ?
he' s on the boardwalk .
it so happens that vegas maintains an account in canada .
name of sunshine clearing corporation .
sunshine clearing corporation ?
has a nice ring to it , don' t you think ?
all right , the deposit has to be in my name .
or an associate' s .
just let us know , bring him down , he signs the money over to you at the cage .
all right , what if ... what if my associate' s in vegas ?
could he sign for it at the cage in vegas ?
yeah , of course , dan .
no problem .
i' il be making a transfer to your sunshine clearing corporation account this afternoon .
okay .
it' s for my own use , but i need to release 40, 000 to an associate in vegas by the name of frank perlin .
frank perlin .
okay , that' il be fine .
uh , mr. perlin will have to sign for the whole amount and we' il credit the rest to you here in sunny atlantic city .
are there any other ahem details we should cover ?
no , we' il take care of everything , mr. mahowny .
thank you for calling .
thank you .
we have a problem with the selkirk account .
what' s the ... what' s the problem ?
i don' t know .
briggs has called a meeting with dana and her father at selkirk international , he wants you to be there .
why are they doing this , alex ?
i mean , no one except dan has seemed even remotely interested in this project .
we go slightly over our loan , and they' re calling my goddamn father in !
it is highly irregular .
we' re barely half a million over .
she' s , uh ... how far over , exactly ?
just under five million .
five million .
mm hm .
already .
incredible .
so you want to give her a tighter line of credit ?
absolutely not .
the inspection department wants to classify the loan as risky ?
no , we are here , gentlemen , to try and force her father to guarantee the loan .
if he does ,
i want her to borrow every cent we can lay our hands on .
it' s a bit of a gamble , but ...
let' s not talk numbers .
a few million won' t mean much to a man like selkirk .
i' m afraid we now consider the projections to be rather ... optimistic .
in what way ?
mr. briggs is referring to the , uh ... failure of the original membership plan ...
failure ...
which was based on tax benefits , which have now been withdrawn .
but our new marketing strategy' s becoming very successful .
as you know .
i appreciate the fact that the bank has a big stake in this project .
i' m surprised it hasn' t voiced it' s concerns earlier .
but i am willing to provide additional security for dana' s project , if it' il get the damn thing up and running .
well done , mahowny .
get the paperwork ready before he changes his mind , would you ?
yeah ?
mahowny' s coming down with , uh ... 1 . 4 million .
they just got the transfer .
only , it' s , uh ... it' s made out to an associate , name of , uh , perlin ?
he' s meant to sign the money over in vegas .
so ?
uh , well , apparently , there' s , uh ... there' s no perlin in vegas to sign .
what ? !
they' ve been holding a room for him , but he hasn' t shown .
mahowny' s going apeshit .
who is this perlin ?
his business partner ?
i don' t know .
i don' t know anything about mahowny , except if we don' t get his money to him tonight , then we may not get it tomorrow .
this is the guy from toronto who plays flat out and you don' t know his story ?
i don' t want to know his story .
are you saying we could be facing a serious judgement call ?
only if we know what we don' t .
where is this perlin ?
toronto .
so fly him down ; he can sign off here .
mahowny' s already run that by him .
he says it' s out of the question tonight .
if the transfer' s in his name ,
perlin' s got to sign off at the cage .
that' s the bottom line ?
that' s the bottom line .
i' m sorry , gentlemen .
how about this ?
what about we just take the cage
not the actual cage , but the personnel and the paperwork and fly it to toronto ?
what are you trying to say ?
perlin signs off at the cage , at the airport , in toronto .
i told you , i' m not flying anywhere till my new suede jacket' s ready .
you don' t have to fly anywhere .
you can collect tonight at the airport .
but it' s not monday .
i know .
it ...
meet me at the executive terminal at six .
executive terminal ?
by the rental car place , okay ?
at six ?
i' il think about it .
the call came from 500 temperance street .
mahowny ?
yeah .
they' re in deep , him and perlin .
how deep you figure ?
i don' t know , but deep .
what about this airport drop off ?
you heard anything like that before ?
no , but ten bucks says were onto a drug deal .
no bet .
wimp .
hi .
hi ?
hi .
i didn' t know if you were on the phone or ...
come in .
where' d you sleep last night ?
in the car .
i didn' t want to disturb you .
but i thought we had an agreement .
i thought it was ... it was going to be different .
that' s what you said , right ?
you think we got problems , blin ?
take a look at mexico' s foreign debt .
we do have a problem , dan !
and you are not giving yourself a chance !
blin , please .
or me !
keep your voice down .
what would you do if you were me , dan ?
just tell me that .
you expect me to just ... to sit back and watch you throw your career down the drain , not to mention our relationship ?
all right , we' il talk about this tonight .
we both know i' m not gonna see you tonight .
i got you this .
i mean , i figured if you were gonna ... if you' re gonna stay out all night , you know , you might as well keep warm .
a winter coat .
i won' t see you tonight ?
honey , this is great .
will i ?
blin , listen ...
no .
no , i' il listen when you have something to say , dan .

hey , you got a new coat .
yeah , it' s from my girlfriend .
yeah , it' s nice .

some girls go for that , frank .

where you going ?
i forgot a bag .
better to have one to go through customs .
where you going ?
it' s all right !
how much for the bags ?
they' re free to customers .
great .

you' re not a customer , sir .
okay .
how much for the bags ?
five bucks ?
five bucks ...
man , that' s nuts , you give them away for free .
five bucks .
what are these two clowns up to , you figure ?
what are you trying to do to me , dan ?
getting you your 40 grand .
" i hereby release all funds under the name frank perlin to be paid to dan mahowny ?
hey , just ... trust me .
there' s no amount here .
you want me to sign it ?
yes , you sign it and then , you get the 40 grand .
all done ?
okay , uh ... just a second .
the dame , she looks like tina turner !
good night , ladies .
good night .

i never gamble myself , personally .
well , i just don' t see the attraction in it .
well , winning , i guess .
but there isn' t much of that , is there ?
if there was ,
i' d be out of a job .
if you ... if you don' t mind me saying .
hey , you win and lose .

an honour and a pleasure .
