the essence of life isn' t comic .
it' s tragic .
there' s nothing intrinsically funny about the terrible facts of human existence .
i disagree .
philosophers call it absurd because , in the end , all you can do is laugh .
human aspirations are so ludicrous and irrational .
i mean , if the underlying reality of our being was tragic , my plays would make more than yours , because my stories would resonate more profoundly with the human soul .
i mean , it' s exactly because tragedy hits on the truly painful essence of life that people run to my comedies for escape .
no , no .
tragedy confronts .
comedy escapes .
look , you guys , what are we discussing here ?
is there a deeper reality in comedy or tragedy ?
who can make such ajudgment ?
look , let me tell you a story and you tell me , is it material for a comedy or a tragedy ?
this happened to some people i know .
it' s a small dinner party .
the hosts are trying to impress one of their guests .
suddenly the doorbell rings and out of nowhere an unexpected person shows up .
a man or a woman ?
a woman .
i' il give you the details and you tell me comedy or tragedy .
so , the guest enters and everyone is surprised , especially the host .
turns out she' s got a particular problem ...
my god , that' s quite amusing .
i mean , she barges in unannounced while they' re eating .
what you told us would make a very good romantic comedy .
because you see the world comically .
you' re missing the tragic implications .
the entanglement it suggests .
no , i see the whole thing quite differently .
i see this lone figure a woman who' s maybe just come off a bus .
she' s toting a suitcase .
maybe she' s searching nervously for an address .
hello ?
who is it ?
hello ?
hello ?
can i help you , miss ?
the springers .
top floor .
it' s really good .
these speakers are wonderful .
you do pick up every little nuance of the orchestra .
tell me again why i can' t have a glass of wine ?
every pregnancy , she asks the same question .
this is the " concerto in d " .
yes .
my god , you really know your stravinsky .
this would be good theme music for the play .
lee ?
that' s a brilliant idea .
i need a little help with the final touches .
can you get the two big serving dishes ?
i' m running out of obsequious banter .
how' s it going ?
he thinks i' m perfect for the part .
the goddamn producer wants more of a name .
i don' t understand why they make such a big deal .
it' s not like it' s the lead .
my first audition went better .
i don' t know what happened .
and i know it' s not the lead , laurel .
doesn' t he have any clout ?
they want a name .
i' m not a name .
you didn' t marry a name .
sally said how much she loves your place .
how long are you here ?
six months , and we' re still not finished .
we have to furnish slowly cos we used up all our money .
we could not go on in that one bedroom .
the piano ate up the living room .
we' re living beyond our means .
i get nervous .
laurel is certain god will provide .
they' re poor , but happy .
definitely poor .
what do you do , peter ?
i' m a lawyer .
no jokes , please .
think the music' s a little too loud ?
i saw you listening to the mahler and crying .
you should have seen her .
she was listening to mahler with tears streaming down her face .
she looked so beautiful .
i wanted to hug her .
yeah .
but i had to get up early and film a deodorant commercial .
that' s work at least , right ?
i think someone rang before .
did you hear ?
so , how do you all know each other ?
we grew up together , cassie and i.
we were those little girls at school with the plaid skirts .
and lee and i met at northwestern .
he was the star actor , the handsome athlete .
everybody wanted him .
but laurel got him .
melinda ?
hi .
melinda ?
hi , melinda , hi .
my goodness .
god .
cassie .
i' m stunned .
here , let me take these .
god , look at you .
you look so ...
no , don' t .
don' t say what you' re thinking of .
i' ve been on a bus .
i' ve been on a greyhound bus since tuesday , so i' m sure i look like the wreck of the hesperus .
a bus from where ?
i mean , what are you doing here ?
i' ve moved around .
i had to keep moving .
events unfolded in such a way that ...
is it all right if i smoke ?
i just feel a little nervous barging in on you like this .
why don' t you sit down and eat with us ?
this is jack and sally oliver .
hi .
hi .
i' m melinda robicheaux .
i' ve gone back to my mother' s name .
it' s french .
she was parisienne .
you must have dropped off the goddamn moon .
shall i get a chair ?
i could use a drink .
champagne or white wine .
the truth is , i' ve gotten very used to single malt scotch .
an acquaintance of mine introduced me to it , so ...
i really should freshen up , though .
if i could just get a single malt scotch , and ...
look at me .
jesus .
i need a hot shower .
yeah .
ok , please ...
excuse us .
please start .
this is so unexpected .
i' il say .
you had no hint she was coming ?
she was nuts then , and she' s nuts now .
did you see the look in her eyes ?
she' s been on a bus .
you were asking how we know each other .
melinda is the third musketeer .
we went to school together .
we haven' t heard from her in ages .
yeah .
she' s had personal difficulties .
she said she' d be coming to new york from ...
i can' t remember , chicago or indiana , and could we put her up ?
laurel said , " sure . " i myself ...
this is not the time to discuss this .
let' s just eat and change the subject .
well , what can you do ?
we' ve all had friends drop in unannounced .
remember your aunt ?
i put up an extra bed .
i fix up the room for her .
she doesn' t show when she says she will .
so we try to contact her and there' s no trace of her .
two months later , she calls up unannounced in the middle of a frigging dinner party .
am i unreasonable ?
no , no !
you' re missing the whole point .
you have the makings of a delightful human comedy here .
you missed the humour in everything .
i see a sweet , tree lined block on the upper east side .
it' s a dinner party .
the husband is fawning over his guest .
he' s a moviemaker .
no , wait .
here' s the idea .
make the film director the wife .
he' s just her out of work actor husband .
she' s trying to impress the guest and raise the money for an independent film .
i just told jennifer that steve is interested in investing in susan' s next movie .
yeah .
i have most of the money .
i' ve just been trying to get it going now for two years .
i liked your first picture .
would you do this one on video too ?
no .
that was just because we only had $300, 000 .
this one will be on 35mm for sure .
well , how much do you need ?
i' ve raised about four million and we need another two million .
the problem is the theme is controversial .
what' s the theme ?
well , let' s put it this way .
it' s a mostly all female cast and it' s called the castration sonata .
do you happen to have single malt scotch ?
you know , let me check .
hurry .
i' m running out of obsequious banter .
don' t throw me .
everything' s timed .
chilean sea bass and caramelised filo is not like scrambled eggs .
well , he happens to love it .
does he love it $2 million worth ?
god , i hope so .
i told you we should keep single malt scotch .
who drinks it ?
he does .
god , you' re definitely going all out .
you' re dressed very sexy .
hobie , keep your eyes on the sea bass !
ok , ok , ok .
she goes down to buy a bottle of single malt scotch .
are you ok ?
yeah , i' m fine .
are you sure ?
yeah .
here we go .
these are coquilles st jacques with cinnamon .
and we' re having sea bass in a caramelised filo pastry , lightly dusted with lime powder .
did someone send you a yuppie cookbook ?
susan says you' re a wonderful chef .
i' m an out of work actor .
who' s that ?
hi .
hi .
i' m sorry .
i hope i' m not intruding .
no , it' s ok .
i' ve been having a kind of bad time and i just took some sleeping pills .
sleeping pills ?
how many ?
28 .
whoa !
call 911 .
stay and just eat .
it' s gonna get cold .
sit .
just stay and eat .
it' s ok .
it' s ok .
hobie , make some black coffee .
ok , ok .
i' m allergic to coffee , but do you have any vodka ?
vodka ?
maybe we should call a doctor .
it' s ok .
i just need something to calm my nerves .
do you live in this building ?
i' ve been subletting for a month .
somebody call a doctor .
careful .
i' m gonna be sick .
that' s the best thing .
no , no , not on the carpet .
that' s a new carpet .
go to the bathroom .
i smell smoke .
can you smell smoke ?
god !
the chilean sea bass lightly dusted with lime !
should you be taking those pills ?
you didn' t have any dinner .
if i don' t , i can' t sleep .
well , cassie' s put on weight , not that i' d ever say anything to her .
cassie' s pregnant .
again ?
they swear they' re stopping at three children .
for me , two was just the right number .
is there any word ?
no , there' s none .
there' s nothing .
now , i don' t want you to get panicky , but i am planning on staying .
just for a while .
i just need to find a place and settle in and rebuild my career .
and you did say that you had enough room to put me up .
we were surprised you never showed up .
we had everything ready .
lee had gotten your room in order .
i apologise for that .
i was going through a kind of confused down period .
i was worried .
lee couldn' t figure out how to get in contact with you .
i' d no idea you were using different names .
what happened ?
i thought the worst was over .
can i speak openly ?
of course .
i tried to commit suicide .
you didn' t .
i did , and it wasn' t a half hearted attempt .
it wasn' t a cry for help .
why ?
i thought everything that happened was past .
i thought you' d pulled yourself together .
because that' s what i wrote you , and some days i honestly thought it .
but in the end , i just couldn' t take it any more .
melinda .
you didn' t find me because i was indisposed .
if you' ve never been in a state mental hospital in a straitjacket , i wouldn' t recommend one , especially not the one i was in , in the midwest .
i' m overwhelmed .
are you ok ?
i mean ...
i' m all right .
i' m on the road back .
i' m still a little fragile when everything closes in , but i get stronger every day .
you know you' re welcome to stay here as long as you like .
there .
how long is she gonna stay ?
why ?
we promised my sister could stay for thanksgiving .
well , thanksgiving' s not for a while .
well , i' m just saying .
she' s trying to pull her life back together .
she' s her own worst enemy .
you don' t know the details .
details ?
what details ?
she was married to some doctor .
she had two kids .
what was she doing playing around with ...
what was he ?
he was a photographer .
melinda .
lee' s right .
whatever i went through , i' m responsible for .
look , we' ve all been drinking and we' re really tired .
it' s ...
no , he' s right .
i was married to a man who loved me and gave me the two most beautiful children .
that i' m not allowed to set eyes on them is just proof of my weakness and my husband' s strength .
no .
it' s disgusting how much influence he had on the judge .
it' s who you know .
life is all networking .
i brought it on myself because i was bored .
i mean , not bored with my children .
god , they were the light of my life .
but i was bored being a doctor' s wife , just as my mother was bored being a doctor' s wife .
like madame bovary .
it' s not that st louis isn' t very beautiful .
it' s just that everything that had seemed so magical when i married josh somehow just melted away .
it was ok , you know ?
and no matter what i did , i couldn' t make it any better .
and then this man with a romantic name
john san giuliano took my photograph .
and i fell in love with him , and we began having this love affair .
and he wanted to know if i could see myself living in italy , and i said , " well , look , mr san giuliano , i' m married to a surgeon with two children .
my life is fixed , so don' t ask me to tax my imagination .
let' s just confine our passion to local motels and forget capistrano .
and then reality set in in the person of a private detective with the unlikely name of woodkrutch , and my children were handed over to my humiliated husband forever .
mr san giuliano took me on a safari to help me forget things .
but i can' t forget , no matter how hard i try .
then he met someone else .
stop , melinda .
why ?
it only gets worse .
so that' s pretty much how i got here .
my god , that' s a sad story .
guy leads her on , causes her to break up her marriage , then dumps her .
i caught him in bed with one of his models .
i mean , who can blame him ?
she was a 6ft swede who was a miss world runner up .
her legs started at her chin .
see , that' s why my film , the castration sonata , puts male sexuality in perspective .
it' s lucky you didn' t have children .
he could have made custody trouble .
i always wanted to have children , but my husband wouldn' t hear of it .
he couldn' t bear having sex with a pregnant woman for nine months , especially the fat months .
so , what are you gonna do now ?
i' m an art historian .
at least , that' s what i majored in at brandeis .
and i may be getting offered ajob in an art gallery .
it' s only cataloguing , but i' m in no position to turn it down .
anyone for more ants climb a tree before i throw it out ?
i can' t eat another bite .
dinner was delicious .
sorry about burning the sea bass and the kitchen curtains .
i' m sorry about busting in on you .
no , no .
we love it when unexpected women barge in and throw up .
i' m kidding .
i hope tonight didn' t kill my chances of getting my movie made .
no , no .
i think steve walsh was ok .
i told him i was gonna play a male character in the movie .
what did he say ?
we discussed acting .
i told him about my award winning pygmalion .
hobie , that was in college .
it was brilliant to play henry with a limp .
god , i hate being an assistant director .
after you' ve made your own film ?
sad thing is , he could have my movie happen like that .
what' s $2 million to a real estate billionaire ?
the upkeep of his private jet is worth more than that .
he was very impressed with you , and you looked very sexy .
really ?
you thought i looked sexy ?
you are sexy .
really , you' re very sexy .
hobie , it' s 2am .
what' s going on ?
we used to make love all the time , and now there' s always an excuse .
i' m going through an emotionally difficult time creatively .
you feel we don' t communicate ?
of course we do .
can we not talk about it ?
hi .
sorry i' m late .
i saw these the other day .
i think they would look very beautiful on you .
beautiful , but you know lee .
he gets crazy about my spending .
how' s he doing ?
you' re not hurting for cash ?
he' s on tenterhooks about the play , but we' re fine .
he' s got a number of irons on the fire , some promising possibilities .
i have a very good prospect for melinda .
ajob prospect ?
a guy .
remember bud silverglide ?
no .
have i met him ?
remember we had thanksgiving at my house and he brought his little girl emily ?
emily ...
emily ?
his wife had died the year before .
yes .
i sat next to him .
he' s average looking .
he' s fine .
he' d be perfect .
he' s a very lovely guy .
he' s smart .
he' s been through his share of suffering .
melinda would have a ready made family .
you think he' s right for her ?
i remember him as pleasant , but ...
she should be so lucky .
he' s got a very successful dental practice in manhattan .
he plays bridge .
he likes to hike .
think he' d be interested in melinda , especially when her past unfolds ?
i know .
she' s in no bargaining position when all the facts come out .
look , i can only bring them together .
he' s not the kind of guy who' d ever wind up hurting her .
that means a lot .
left to her own devices , melinda can be self destructive .
bud is sweet , and i know he' s lonely because he' s taken ads in the personal columns .
don' t tell melinda that .
peter' s checking into her custody case to see if it' s a lost cause .
i told her to meet us here for lunch after herjob interview .
should we sit ?
i don' t know .
can we take this table ?
thanks .
i know it' s here somewhere .
we got this house guest living here .
everything' s messed up .
i wish she would check before she moves my possessions .
i love your loft .
it' s really amazing .
here we are .
an essay on desdemona' s role in othello .
the scene you should do in our next class is the one we talked about yesterday .
you really think i' m ready for it ?
i do .
you' re among the two or three most talented students in my class , and the sooner you challenge yourself , the better .
you' re the only one who makes me feel confident enough to take chances .
aren' t you nervous bringing me back here ?
it' s ok .
my wife' s shopping , then going to lunch .
she' s always shopping and lunching .
she grew up shopping and lunching .
her mother did , and her grandmother .
you shouldn' t really drink so early in the day .
shopping and lunching' s what you get when you marry a park avenue princess .
what does your wife do ?
besides shopping ?
she teaches tin eared teenagers at a music school a few days a week .
it' s funny , but life has a malicious way of dealing with great potential .
my god .
get ...
hi .
i just got back from my job interview .
i don' t think it went too well , so just stopped off for a little pick me up .
you ok ?
yeah .
yeah .
well , i' m gonna go and meet laurel and cassie for lunch in our old neighbourhood .
i' m just gonna go freshen up .
the park hasn' t changed a bit .
not at all .
it brings back so many memories .
those days are gone when the three of us thought we could call the shots .
what i wouldn' t give to wake up and find my life has been a bad dream and we' re all still 17 .
tell me about it .
you wouldn' t change anything .
i mean , your life is pretty much on track , right ?
well , the question' s not fair .
i mean , who wouldn' t profit from a second go around ?
so , what about bud silverglide ?
the dentist with the charming little daughter ?
he' s a wonderful guy .
if anything ever did happen and you hit it off , you could establish something solid .
not more unrealistic pipe dreams that can' t help but wind up badly .
i' m sorry .
did that come out harsh ?
the truth is , i' m nervous .
i wanna meet someone so desperately , but when the chance comes along , i just panic .
it won' t be a date .
i' il make a dinner party and we' il all be there to support you .
i' il invite a number of nice guests and he' il be one of them , and if you meet and hit if off , then great , and if not , then no obligation .
yeah .
when he hears my story ...
my god .
i come with such baggage .
well , don' t go in with a defeatist attitude .
yeah .
first see if you even like him .
if he' s as nice as cassie' s painting him ...
he' s a good catch , if i can speak pragmatically , especially for you , cos he' s got his feet on the ground .
if i find him at all attractive , i think i should just tell him my whole story right off .
or do you think it' s better to wait ?
let him take the hook first , and then run with it ?
god .
i can' t believe i' m even asking this .
i' m already strategising .
i haven' t met this guy yet .
if we' re gonna do this , it has to be completely informal , cos i can' t handle it any other way .
i don' t have any dressy clothes anyhow .
funny part of that is , as elegant as i can look and you know , i can look pretty stylish men find women sexier in casual attire .
it' s true .
i could wear my hair down and loose .
that' s enticing already .
at least it' s not intimidating .
you haven' t told him anything about me ?
i can if you like .
no .
no .
my sad tale should come from my lips , if and when i choose to reveal it .
cut .
ok , great .
that was great .
it was great .
you took the note great .
print one and six .
you got it ?
ok , hey , everybody , that' s lunch .
one hour .
thank you .
hey , are you gonnajoin us ?
no .
i' m meeting a friend .
tell the actors we' re gonna do scene ten instead of 26 .
ok .
we' re doing scene ten instead of 26 .
hey .
hey .
should we just sit here ?
yeah .
so , what did he say ?
that steve is inclined to put up the money .
he likes your script and wants to have lunch with you .
fantastic !
yeah , it looks really good .
he was concerned that you intended for hobie to play the psychiatrist .
you know , he wants a name .
i understand .
it' s gonna be kind of a touchy subject at home because , i mean , the truth is he' d make the perfect shrink , and he knows it .
but , let' s face it , he' s not a name , and i want people to see my movie too , so ...
well , i' m sure that you guys will figure it out , and i think it' s very exciting .
doug and i know somebody perfect for melinda , your downstairs neighbour who crashed dinner .
remember greg earlinger ?
no .
doug' s dentist .
you met him with us once .
yes .
he has a great sports car .
the bentley .
he' s single and available .
she would find him fascinating .
he' s smart , sensitive ...
why would he be interested in her ?
she seemed quite pretty , she' s offbeat and greg always likes complicated women .
doug has already hyped him on her .
ask her if we can give him her number , ok ?
hey .
melinda .
hey .
hi .
hi .
my friend walt .
this is melinda .
she just moved in .
how are you ?
nice to meet you .
how' s it going ?
all right .
i just interviewed for ajob at an art gallery and i don' t think it went too well .
you never know .
i had a voice over audition today .
thought i' d never get it .
bang , i was chosen .
it' s the voice of a toothpaste .
that' s good .
i' m trying to decide whether to stay and wait for the phone call or whether i should go out and treat myself to a movie .
why don' t you come with us ?
where ?
going to the track .
to the track ?
yeah .
horse races .
belmont .
what , you play the horses ?
never .
well , i go every ten years .
walt' s always going .
he' s a gambling degenerate .
yes .
can' t you tell i' m a degenerate ?
i' m a complete novice , like you .
come on .
it' s a beautiful day .
we' il have some laughs .
sure .
i don' t have any money .
i' ve got plenty of money .
for both of us .
we' il pool our resources .
if you want .
ok .
all right .
yeah .
nice to meet you .
nice to meet you again .
come on !
come on , bedazzled !
let' s go , bedazzled .
no , no .
you did not bet on bedazzled .
it' s a 90 1 horse !
if it wins , we' re rich .
he' s right , hobie .
he' s dropping back .
no , no , no , no , no .
he' s second .
he' s second ... second from last .
so , i have to ask you , how' d you go from living on the upper east side to st louis ?
i moved there for him .
he was gorgeous .
he was talented , he was sexy , he was a doctor , he was charming ...
yes , but where' s the attraction ?
he just knew how to touch me .
you mean emotionally ?
no , with his hands .
i' m a very passionate person , so sex is very important to me .
you know , i need a lot of physical intimacy very often and creatively .
right .
right , right , right , right .
that' s ... that' s ...
yeah .
am i being too frank ?
no , no , no .
no , i just ...
i' il be ok .
i get hot flashes .
your wife is passionate .
i can tell by looking .
right , right .
a lot of people have noticed .
why did your marriage fail again ?
he was cheating with his secretary .
i felt neglected , so i started seeing someone else .
i just wanna find someone , fall in love and have a life .
hello .
hey .
guess what ?
what ?
steve is putting up the money for my film .
that' s great .
congratulations .
so if i' m suddenly very busy and distracted , don' t take it personally .
and we have to talk about casting .
yes .
what did you do today ?
i told you .
i went out to the track .
yeah .
with who again ?
with who ?
with me , with me .
with me ... me and walt .
walt wagner .
well , i hope you didn' t lose a lot .
no .
we don' t have a lot , so i couldn' t .
in fact , if i had more money , we could' ve lost more .
it' s a system i developed .
why didn' t you just tell her melinda came along ?
what did you just say about melinda ?
what ?
no .
i didn' t say anything about melinda .
you just muttered her name .
i was wondering how the poor thing' s doing .
you know , plain looking girl , all alone ...
i' d hardly call her plain looking .
well ...
jennifer wants to set her up with someone .
remember greg earlinger , doug' s dentist ?
we met him once .
he' s a tall , sexy , handsome looking guy .
the bentley .
very well off .
charming , bright .
you commented on how impressive he was .
vaguely .
anyway , doug' s hyped him on melinda .
yeah , i think ...
why , i do recall him .
wasn' t he full of himself , though ?
kind of an unjustified self confidence ?
as i recall , it was justified .
someone who has an answer for everything .
i' m gonna ask melinda if it' s ok if we give him her number .
no .
no , don' t be silly .
what does she wanna do with a dentist ?
she was already married to a doctor .
she found that dull .
a dentist is the same thing , but oral .
greg' s not dull .
he hikes .
he' s a great bridge player .
tennis .
he goes on safaris .
well , it ...
i mean , who goes on safaris ?
you need shots to do that .
melinda , hey , it' s susan .
how are you ?
good .
i was wondering if it was ok with you if we give your number to this wonderful guy .
i' m not giving the number out .
don' t say that i am ...
he' s a very rich dentist .
he' s cultivated and athletic .
he' s gorgeous looking .
gorgeous dentist " is an oxymoron .
and ...
there' s nothing to be nervous about .
look , we' il all go out , the four of us .
we' il go to dinner or we' il go to a show or something .
i don' t think you' il be sorry .
i think she' s never , ever gonna go for it .
ok , great .
not in a million years .
fantastic .
ok , bye .
she loves the idea .
i told you .
hi .
what are you doing down here ?
i got the part !
the director kept insisting and the producers finally gave in .
that' s great , lee .
finally , a role i can make sing .
you' re certainly a natural for the character .
why would you say that ?
you' ve said it a hundred times .
i said i could act the hell out of it .
he' s a loser .
let' s not fight .
i meant nobody can play the part like you can .
you see me like that , don' t you ?
i' m asking .
is that how you see me ?
i' m really happy for you .
i know how much you wanted this .
can' t we leave it at that ?
i' m wired .
i didn' t mean to seem snappish .
shall we go out to dinner and celebrate ?
tonight' s cassie' s party .
yeah , right .
ok .
jesus .
it' s time melinda met someone , moved on .
i' d like a little privacy in the apartment .
ok .
i' ve got a couple of options .
i could wear ...
i can wear this skirt with this shirt , like this .
this goes around the other way , like this , and i could wear it with this shirt here .
what do you think ?
the silk one is sexier , but this one' s elegant .
you think the silk one' s sexier ?
so maybe i should wear this .
sex works best in the end .
men like to feel there' s some hot payoff waiting for ' em somewhere down the track .
god , look at me .
i' m so fat .
fat ?
melinda , everyone should be so fat .
i didn' t eat anything since friday .
i wanted to lose six pounds .
it' s not healthy .
i mean , an empty stomach and all those pills , and ...
i don' t know .
maybe this is better .
maybe sex is too predatory a message to send , and elegance is a wiser opening gambit .
i don' t think it matters much .
you look great .
doesn' t she ?
yeah .
very stylish .
look at me .
i' m fat .
i can' t lose any weight .
i think i need another drink .
alcohol' s fattening .
can you make it a vodka ?
plus an empty stomach with pills ?
vodka' s not fattening .
i need something to calm me down , just to make me a little more confident .
i' ve got goddamn circles under my eyes .
you look fine .
that' s easy for you to say because you' re still beautiful .
i feel like i' m running on empty .
i don' t wanna go .
honestly , i don' t wanna go to this thing .
come on .
it' s just a little party with friends .
how did i wind up desperate ?
because that' s what i am , laurel .
there' s no other word .
you' re a catch for the right man .
you really are .
falling in love is gonna work wonders for you .
congratulations .
i hear lee got that part .
we' re very excited .
no one at school played the classics like lee .
they still talk about the strindberg series .
yes .
he' s held himself back from commercial work because he' s got such high standards .
he won' t do anything just for the money .
yeah .
i knew that director would have his way , and he wanted you .
my agent' il bring film people to the opening cos there' s talk of a project in california .
i' d drink to your good fortune , but vodka' s not good for samantha .
it' s gonna be a girl .
cassie , i never slept with a pregnant woman before .
no ?
no .
it always struck me as so erotic doing it with your big belly .
peter says it' s just like screwing any fat person .
i don' t suppose he' d lend you out to me so i could satisfy a lifelong lustful curiosity ?
why don' t you get laurel pregnant ?
then you wouldn' t need to make arrangements .
maybe if things work out now , we can start to think about it .
i always wanted to have kids .
knock her up , then you can make love to her in all the trimesters .
if you knew how much i wanted to do it with you , you' d do itjust out of human kindness .
too late .
ball was in your court years ago .
you ran in another direction .
how' s our matchmaking going ?
they seem to be hitting it off well .
peter , what' s it like to sleep with a pregnant woman ?
have you ever made love with a loser at weight watchers ?
didn' t i tell you ?
the great thing about hiking is you' re free .
you feel free .
you' re up there in the mountains or in the woods , and it' s beautiful .
almost religious .
and i am not religious .
certainly not after dorothy passed away .
that must have been really tough on your daughter .
i' ve tried to explain it all to emily , including the whole religious aspect , but what the hell ?
she' s four .
i just don' t want her to be angry at god or against religion .
i want her to be happy and educate herself and make her own decisions about the big questions .
look , melinda ,
i' d love to call you .
maybe we could spend some time getting to know one another .
i know you just returned to new york , but it' s really changed .
i' d be glad to show you around .
to tell you the truth , bud , i don' t really think i' m ready to go out yet .
i don' t think it would be fair to you .
maybe when i' m a little more settled .
sure .
at your leisure .
i understand .
jesus .
emily' s with a new sitter tonight and , of course , i' m a basket case .
that' s very sweet .
would you excuse me ?
laurel , you know this one .
play .
i can' t .
he plays so beautifully .
hey , here .
come on .
come on .
take over .
you' re wonderful .
sorry .
i didn' t mean to interrupt .
i' m just gonna get a drink .
that' s ok .
i was just rubbing this lamp , hoping to change my life .
well , i believe in magic .
in the end , i think it' s the only thing that can save us .
you' re the piano player .
not any more .
i' m on a break .
a mysterious stranger has temporarily taken over .
i must say , she plays beautifully .
hey .
are your eyes misting over ?
this song , it' s meaningful to me .
it was playing the night i met someone .
so are they tears of sorrow or tears ofjoy ?
well , aren' t those the same tears ?
yeah .
why do things that start off so promisingly always have a way of ending up in the dump ?
not for everyone .
well , for anybody with any imagination .
you know , life is manageable enough if you keep your hopes modest .
the minute you allow yourself sweet dreams you run the risk of them crashing down .
there' s plenty of old songs that i cry over .
my name is melinda .
melinda robicheaux .
it' s french .
that' s a very beautiful name .
thank you .
it' s my mother' s .
she married a dr nash , so i grew up nash , but i' ve changed it to her name .
and that is a wise choice .
it' s very musical .
my name is ellis moonsong .
i am from harlem , usa .
ellis moonsong .
is that really your name ?
yes , it is .
let' s go and sit down .
it' s wonderful .
you also play beautifully .
well , one thing i could always do was make music .
i can play all the instruments , but my specialty is composition .
i' ve written two operas .
one was done at yale , i' m proud to say successfully , and the other one is being done in santa fe next summer .
very impressive .
yeah , listen to me brag .
i' m insecure , so i sell myself .
the truth is , not everybody likes the music .
they' re kind of modern , but the critics were extremely supportive .
is that what you wanna be another verdi or puccini ?
i don' t kid myself , you know , but , yeah .
if i could rub that lamp and have my wish ...
operas , symphonies , string quartets .
there' s a lot of interest in my work in europe .
i might go to barcelona or to paris to live .
god , i can' t stop gushing about myself .
you' ve opened pandora' s box .
and you ?
i don' t write opera , but my life has been one .
i' m one of those heroines too high strung for existence on this planet , although i brought my worst troubles on myself .
i shouldn' t have reached so thoughtlessly for my dreams .
we grab without thinking because we' re passionate people .
i knew you were passionate once we started talking .
how ?
how ?
well , your eyes , your voice .
i got a great instinct about people .
you know , i do .
it' s a gift .
let me get right to the point .
can i get to know you better ?
i gotta go back and play , but could we have lunch , you know , or dinner ?
you can certainly have my number , if that' s what you' re asking .
let me ...
i' il just get a pen .
there you are .
i saw mr bud silverglide .
the mystery pianist .
mr moonsong , ellis moonsong , this is laurel .
laurel ?
i dated a laurel .
she broke my heart .
i wrote this piece of music and i dedicated it to her hoping it would win her back .
let me be the first to tell you , it did not .
he composes serious music .
you two should have a lot to discuss cos laurel gave concerts .
those days vanished with the lost chord .
his opera was a big success at yale and they' re doing the other one where ?
at the santa fe opera house .
it' s great when it' s stretched out in front of you .
well , i wish i was as optimistic as you .
well , i' il call you tomorrow .
i' m busy tomorrow .
what' s tomorrow ?
well , then , i' il call you the day after .
if you feel like it .
what happened with you and the swell dentist ?
he was very , very sweet .
very cute .
butjust not for me .
but ellis moonsong is very poetic .
melinda .
things are amazing .
you meet a stranger , and in a sudden rush , you' re thinking to yourself , " could i live in barcelona ?
be careful .
i mean , you can' t go through life rubbing lamps and wishing .
it doesn' t work .
take it from me .
hey .
greg earlinger .
hi .
greg earlinger .
i' m susan .
we' ve met .
this is melinda .
yes , wow .
nice to meet you .
nice to meet you .
so , this is hobie .
you' re the gynaecologist .
close .
no , i' m the dentist .
dentist .
dentist .
what were you thinking ?
i love it at this time of year .
it' s so beautiful .
it' s nice when it' s so bright , huh ?
you know , it' s really sexy , isn' t it ?
you look a little carsick .
why ?
cos i' m the colour of guacamole ?
this is going well .
look how happy she looks .
i wish we could afford a pad in the hamptons .
everybody who' s anybody has one .
but if you' re somebody who' s nobody , it' s no fun to be around anybody who' s everybody .
isn' t he charming ?
and don' t tell me he' s not gorgeous .
if you like perfect features .
don' t be such a crab .
i' m gonna try to come out here more often .
wow , it' s so big .
thank you .
it' s so clean , too .
it' s a great place to entertain , which i love .
god , hobie , isn' t it amazing ?
yeah , i love the ramp .
it' s wheelchair accessible .
that' s important out here .
go ahead , guys .
go in .
thanks .
it' s tremendous for aerobics .
come on , try it , hobie .
what do you do for exercise ?
tiddlywinks .
and an occasional anxiety attack .
try it , hobie .
it' s good manners .
since when do i have good manners ?
what is that ?
is it a pig ?
i don' t know .
hey , greg , did you shoot this ?
well , actually , i shot all of those .
twice a year i go to africa .
the experience would take your breath away .
huge herds of kudu greater kudu and lesser kudu .
which is bigger ?
the greater or the lesser ?
hobie !
i think it would be the sexiest thing to sleep under the stars in the middle of the jungle ...
if you don' t mind waking up with a python in your sleeping bag .
no , no .
the whole thing is very civilised .
they have beds and bathrooms and showers .
but no elevators .
in case you' re being chased by a tiger and you have to get up into a tree .
i' d have to take the elevator .
i don' t understand .
me neither .
did you shoot all the furniture ?
so , melinda , have you ever shot a gun ?
how quickly was it shot ?
freshly shot ?
right here ?
that' s fine .
this was fun .
thank you .
are you sure you' il be all right ?
i' m fine .
do you wanna come up for a drink ?
a drink !
yeah , we could do that .
we can' t .
you have to get up early .
why ?
i' m out of work .
hey , do you have any tequila ?
i make the world' s most potent margarita .
they' re very strong .
i sure do .
are you all right ?
here , can i help you ?
very good .
you know this car so well .
he' s like an old man .
thank you .
i' m fine .
it' s like we' re dancing .
tequila' s on the surgeon general' s list .
just be quiet .
why' d he stop twice to get the car washed ?
god , he' s incredible , isn' t he ?
it' d be great for melinda if things worked out .
i wouldn' t let that guy fill my teeth .
i mean , anyone who gets his jollies putting holes in animals ...
the ernest hemingway of the root canal set .
he' s probably got her in bed by now .
i didn' t think she could stand him .
not every woman falls for that phoney social rap , you know , with the haut brion and special cheeses and backgammon trophy .
someone must blow him up with an air hose .
you know what ?
can we just not discuss it ?
and , frankly , i thought you acted like a clown .
now , can i talk to you for a minute ?
and try not to get upset .
what ?
you wanna spend more time in the hamptons whether i go with you or not ?
i told you steve walsh is gonna co produce my film .
yes , that' s fantastic .
i figured out a great way to play the psychiatrist .
it' s fresh .
with a limp .
i do a great limp , and that will account for his crushing insecurity .
that way , when i make a pass at rosalie , i expect the rejection .
you won' t be able to play the shrink .
why not ?
steve wants a name .
i have a name on my driver' s licence .
he won' t go with an unknown .
you' re the director .
you say what goes .
without him , there' s no film .
but i' m the perfect psychiatrist .
you said it .
i think i can find something else for you in the script .
like what ?
what about moe flanders ?
you' d be a natural .
you' re more flanders than you are the shrink .
flanders ?
the retarded elevator operator with the cleft palate ?
is that how you see me ?
when have i said you had a cleft palate ?
help !
my god .
that' s melinda .
he' s raping her .
probably put novocaine in her margarita .
help !
help !
what is it ?
what' s wrong ?
what' s wrong ?
i got a tick !
there' s a tick in my leg .
where' s greg ?
he' s a dentist .
he doesn' t do tick extractions .
his beeper went off .
he had some kind of emergency .
someone saw a rhino on sixth avenue and they needed a hunter .
get it out !
quick !
please !
please !
i don' t know how .
in the bronx we had mice .
you need a doctor .
you can' t pull it out cos the body comes out and the head stays in .
i feel terrible .
i think i' m gonna faint .
take her to the emergency room .
there' s a tick inside me sucking my blood !
it' s not sucking your blood .
those are leeches .
but this is disgusting enough .
i' m so sorry .
it was so nice of you to come and hang with me .
that' s ok .
actually , i love watching a live creature being pulled out of somebody' s body at 3 . 30am .
if that happens again , please call me .
it was really nice of you this whole day .
it' s obvious you don' t care much for the beach .
it' s not the beach so much as the ocean , the sand and the seagulls and things like that .
well , go .
you' ve had a long day .
rest .
call me .
i' m over here if you need me .
ok ?
but try not to panic .
the screaming frightened me .
and you would be totally cool if you had a live insect crawling around under your skin ?
i wouldn' t enjoy it , but i wouldn' t panic .
that' s good because there' s one in the back of your neck .
my neck ?
your neck .
my neck ?
yes .
right here .
it' s ok .
get it off !
get it off me !
relax .
ok .
this is exciting .
i' ve never been to the races before .
here' s a horse called broadway melody .
i think that' s a lucky name .
well , it' s not very sensible to pick horses by their names , but i guess it' s romantic .
that was so beautiful .
there is no more sublime music than that second movement .
laurel cannot listen without crying .
her eyes are all red .
i' m with her .
when raphael first laid eyes upon the sistine chapel he passed out .
aren' t you gonna find us a taxi ?
yeah , let' s go .
she' s head over heels in love with him .
he' s gifted , sensitive .
he is unfazed by the details of her past .
he is , in fact , moved by her suffering .
even the awful story she' s been reluctant to tell but feels that she must .
i killed him .
but it was an accident .
no .
in my defence , i will say i was out of my mind on drugs .
i shouldn' t say drugs .
pills .
pills to help me sleep at night , pills to keep me awake , whatever i could get my hands on to sweep my various pains and anxieties under the rug .
but if i' m honest about it , i did mean to do it .
no .
i denied it in the trial , of course .
but the fact is , i ...
i couldn' t think of what else to do .
i thought about killing myself .
why i didn' t , i can' t say .
it would have been much more rational .
i thought about killing his girlfriend .
maryanne was her name .
maryanne lane .
and it was ...
it was so easy buying a gun .
i just drove out of state and i walked into a store and i bought one .
there were no questions asked .
i bought a box of bullets and i loaded it like i' d been handling one my whole life .
it was all very premeditated , despite what my attorneys would have everyone believe .
and then i drove back to where he worked .
it was next to a christian science reading room .
i remember that .
and i just waited out the front for him to come out .
and even that wasn' t very difficult .
there was a slight drizzle , i remember that , but the wait wasn' t interminable .
and then when he came out and walked to his car , i simply confronted him .
and he said some very cold and cruel things to me , and i shot mr san giuliano
as i had planned to .
as i had planned .
well , they must have felt the circumstances were extenuating if you got off so lightly .
it may seem lightly to you , but it was nothing but hell .
and if you' ve never been arrested and put on trial , well , that alone is sentence enough .
the horror , the ... the tension , the police , the journalists ...
i went over my story hundreds of times the jilted mother , seduced away from her family , sick on drugs , the struggle for the gun , the gun goes off .
but there was no struggle .
that was legal fiction .
well , you had good lawyers .
not like your child custody team .
i rememberjust lying in my cell at night and thinking ,
my god .
you are melinda nash from park avenue .
what the hell are you doing in a women' s prison in illinois ?
so , naturally , after i got out i decided to end it all .
what do you want ?
i want to want to live .
everybody wants to live .
now that i met you , i' m feeling a little more positive about it .
congratulate me .
i just got canned .
my version differs from theirs .
they would have you believe i couldn' t hold my liquor , which anyone who knows me knows is a baseless canard .
lee , i knew this would happen .
you did ?
well , why didn' t you tell me ?
i' m angry and disgusted .
i mean , christ , can you blame them ?
thank you for the emotional support .
i' il see you around .
hey .
hi .
you all right ?
you seem a little glum .
lee got fired .
what happened ?
it was the producer .
they' d always wanted a name .
they got nervous cos ticket sales were slow .
i' m sorry .
i know the realities of the marketplace .
yeah .
so , what are you gonna do ?
i don' t know if i should feel sorry for myself or shop to blot out my depression .
neither .
come with us .
with you ?
sure .
i' m taking melinda to a recording session .
bartk .
no ...
it' il take your mind off things .
you love bartk .
they' re doing a quartet .
you remembered ?
come on .
do i have time to change ?
you look fine .
look at me .
i feel so grungy .
i' ve been working all day .
all right , but hurry , then we' il get a coffee .
ok .
it' s beautiful , isn' t it ?
they' re so good .
i could never decide between the piano and the cello .
the result is i play them both badly .
and the viola .
i heard you play the piano .
you' re good .
no .
yes .
full of feeling .
you have a lovely touch of the keys .
i can see a person' s soul by their intonation on an instrument
keyboard , horn or strings .
i can .
it' s a gift .
you saw my soul ?
right off the bat .
that first party , when you sat down next to me to play , the minute you touched the keys the chord went through me like a knife .
i don' t dare ask you what you saw .
it' s great .
although i find the more turbulent parts a little scary .
he' s still not home .
come to dinner with us .
no , i can' t .
come on .
it' s gonna be fun .
we' il go down to this little bistro downtown west .
it' s very quiet , very dark , very french .
i haven' t been to a dark bistro since college .
you' il love it .
i' ve fallen in love there .
no more for me .
melinda was the fast , advanced one .
come on .
all the men were crazy for her .
they were drawn to her .
her unpredictability .
no , laurel was the star of our group .
i remember how jealous everyone was when you married lee .
lee was the most attractive , most charismatic actor .
my god .
you almost broke cassie' s heart , not that she' d ever admit it .
forgive me .
am i being too open here ?
it' s just i feel great .
what is this ?
it' s a haut brion .
my head is swimming .
but it feels good .
you were the first one in our group to sleep with a man .
you were so very sophisticated .
i admired it .
i did .
yeah , well , it was probably true .
i had a deep hunger for physical intimacy .
a hunger that could not be denied .
not once adolescence descended and the hormones kicked in .
melinda had a reputation for being postmodern in bed .
life is short .
that was a sobering discovery i made when my mother killed herself .
short , and not about anything except what you can touch and what touches you .
whereas i ...
i' ve only made love with one man in my life .
lee was the first and lee was the whole story ever since .
that' s perfect .
no , i mean it .
i think there' s something almost mystical about two people who only know each other .
and , really , you' re both very alike .
you know , you' re both very , very passionate women .
you' re poured into one person , and you' ve wanted to live out different experiences .
is that you ?
no .
no , i think it' s me .
so , i got a message .
that was peter .
i think he' s got some news about my children .
would you excuse me for a minute ?
yeah , go ahead .
i was determined not to ask you what you saw when you looked right through to my soul when we met .
but i wanna know .
something very clouded and protective , with lots of longing .
there was ...
wow , there was a great longing in the notes you played .
that' s as accurate a diagnosis as a shrink would make .
it took you a much shorter time .
you sat down and pressed the keyboard , and i thought , " who is this lovely creature with the melancholy touch on the keyboard ?
then i saw your wedding ring , and i thought , you know , story of my life .
is that the story of your life ?
well , it' s the main chapters .
my first impression was , he' s handsome , he' s lost , he' s got inscrutable eyes ...
melinda would like him .
speaking of melinda .
i don' t dare say this , but it looks hopeful .
god .
i almost wish this opportunity hadn' t come up , you know .
i just don' t know if i can handle the tension .
i mean ...
just say it doesn' t work out .
it will .
you have to think positively .
she' s right .
you were correct when you said that life is short and not about anything , but one thing i do know is that we were not put on this earth to be dragged all the time .
we should go .
i was hoping that you could come by my class one afternoon and lecture the students .
it would be so meaningful to them .
i' d love to .
i' m a good lecturer .
i just hope i' m not a better lecturer than a composer .
you' re home .
i' m sorry , laurel .
i really messed things up .
yes , well , you really have to get a handle on your drinking .
yes .
and i will .
of course , now the boat sailed .
made you some dinner .
i ate .
where were you ?
i had some late meetings at school .
i don' t know what to do .
and you' re sure ?
yes .
it was there in his talk , in his eyes .
and you flirted back ?
yes .
i was outta control , letting him know i was there for him .
god .
poor melinda .
i don' t wanna hear about poor melinda .
other people' s lives are falling apart .
peter and i suspected it was not going well with lee .
does everyone ?
am i gossiped about ?
god , that poor girl .
don' t worry .
i' m not gonna do anything .
you already have .
if you get divorced , there' il be lots of men .
peter and i can help .
no .
i' m not gonna be the pathetic single friend getting introduced to some dentist .
you' re gonna act on this .
i see it .
i don' t know what to do .
i can' t stop thinking about melinda .
she just knocked on our door carrying her neurosis in her arms .
now i can' t get her out of my mind .
come on .
you' re married .
i know .
i know that .
i' m consumed with guilt .
i dream of myself kissing melinda .
then i' m on trial at nuremberg .
how does melinda feel ?
i haven' t been able to tell her that .
the subject of infidelity' s out of the question .
you don' t know if she feels the same ?
no , i think she does .
i just haven' t had a chance to pursue it .
i mean , walt , here' s the thing .
my marriage has been on the decline for a long time .
we hardly ever sleep together .
the last time we did susan just lay there staring into the darkness as if her parents had been killed in a fire .
well , why can' t you just tell her it' s not working any more ?
i don' t wanna hurt her .
i couldn' t fire my podiatrist who operated on my wrong foot .
maybe you should go back to your shrink .
he' d just recommend prozac .
i think he has stock in the company .
maybe you' re using susan as an excuse .
no .
yes .
maybe you don' t even really wanna do it .
no , cos if there was a button i could push to be with melinda but not hurt susan , i' d do it .
tell me this .
how wise is it to get involved with a woman with melinda' s track record ?
that' s why i' m convinced i' m in love with her , because there' s no logical reason to be .
be a man .
be honest with susan .
i don' t know ...
that' s what you have to do !
be honest with her .
she' il live , you' il live .
then you go out , you buy melinda a nice little bauble
i heard her say that she likes art deco
take her out , confess your feelings .
you sure ?
yeah .
that' s the way .
this is gonna crush susan .
how you doin ' ?
the deco pin there .
how much is that ?
that' s $150 .
could you giftwrap that for me ?
yes , of course .
i wish i could be with melinda without hurting my wife .
hobie , what are you doing here ?
now , don' t get upset .
hobie , i think you should know that steve and i have become attracted to one another .
you have ?
if you punch me in the nose , i' d understand .
he came here to be with me while i told you .
you have to admit , things have run out of steam between us .
i just ...
try to understand .
i do .
i think we' ve been drifting a ...
wait .
you do understand ?
i do .
most definitely .
you' re having an affair with steve walsh .
he' s wonderful .
he' s clever .
he' s smart .
he' s fabulously wealthy .
i know .
i just want you to know i don' t want anything .
i know how tough your work has been for you , and we' ve decided steve is just gonna help with all the legal expenses , and i just want everything to be as painless and as civilised as possible .
you know , i think that we can always be friends .
melinda .
hobie .
can you meet me for a few minutes ?
there' s something i' m dying to tell you when you get off work .
you know that little french bistro on the corner of tenth avenue ?
the little candlelightjoint , near where you work .
are you sure you should be drinking so much without having any lunch ?
well , we worked through lunch .
i was doing a voice over commercial .
it' s not what i envisioned when i was at northwestern .
they still talk about my portrayal of king lear .
i played it with a limp .
how are you liking the job at the gallery ?
well , my boss is great .
she has amazing taste .
good .
i mean , it' s not a very high paying job , but it' s fantastic cos i have plenty of time to think about what i wanna do with my life .
well , i' m glad you said that .
god , you look very pretty in this candlelight .
i' m sure anyone would look amazing with all this flickering shadows and all the wine you' re drinking .
right .
right .
well , i' m drinking because life moves so fast .
so unpredictably .
you know , it' s over so fast and in the end , what is it ?
chekhov said a soap bubble .
did i tell you i played uncle vanya once ?
with a limp .
it was interesting .
you know , it' s funny that you should say " unpredictable " , because i was walking home yesterday .
i have to tell you this story .
so , some people were moving into an apartment on 90th street .
and they were moving this piano , so there was this piano just , you know , sitting in the middle of the sidewalk .
and i couldn' t resist the temptation just to go up and give it a little tinkle .
i play a little piano .
i used to play in high school .
i actually gave some concerts .
anyway , i' m playing this piano .
i' m playing this little tune that my mother taught me .
and this ... this guy came up and started talking to me .
hi .
hi .
that' s good .
you play the melody .
all right .
is that what you' re trying for ?
exactly .
good .
so , his name is billy wheeler , and he' s a piano player .
and he also writes pretty music .
and he walked me back to my apartment and he invited me out on a date .
and
i think i' m in love .
in love ?
well , i mean , i' m exaggerating , of course , but some bell definitely went off .
a bell ?
one of those bells that now and then rings , as mr cole porter put it .
so , anyway , i just thought that you would be pleased to know .
so , what is it that you wanted to tell me ?
i don' t ...
it doesn' t matter .
ok .
this situation is perfect he' s despondent , he' s desperate , he' s suicidal .
all the comic elements are in place .
now she' s going out with billy wheeler , and hobie' s the single upstairs neighbour .
now she' s fixing him up .
we must know somebody for hobie .
the woman who owns your art gallery ?
phoebe' s married .
i don' t need to meet anyone .
i' m fine just staying in my room and ...
and what ?
moping ?
get out and reinvest your emotion .
don' t indulge your depression .
hey .
stacey fox .
why not ?
who ?
she recently broke up with some wall street guy .
she' s bright and great looking .
what does she do ?
investment .
one of those business suits who makes love to you on a conference call .
she' s no stereotype .
she posed for a feature for playboy on naked political conservatives .
well , uh , i don' t know if that' s his type .
she' s probably got augmented cleavage .
she' s anybody' s type .
come on .
wednesday' s halloween .
we were gonna go out .
you should meet stacey .
i think she just broke up .
hobie agrees to being fixed up , but he' s still madly in love with melinda .
he dreams about her all the time .
he' s consumed with jealousy .
he can' t bear the thought that she might be making love with another man .
he wants to know !
but he doesn' t wanna know .
it' s driving him crazy .
did you hear something ?
i heard something at the front .
can you just go check the door ?
make sure it' s locked .
what is it ?
what' s the matter ?
i need to talk to you .
you look terrible .
what happened ?
i think laurel and ellis are having an affair .
what ?
i' m going crazy .
i just ...
take it easy , will you ?
i don' t know what to do .
well , what makes you think so ?
i just know it , ok ?
i' ve been through this once before .
laurel is supposed to be my closest friend .
but what makes you think that something' s going on ?
i thought it was my paranoia .
then last week i was coming home from house hunting .
ellis was out of town .
and i overheard this argument between laurel and lee .
what' s this ?
what ?
whose key is this ?
who' s a ?
a ?
whose keys are in our bathroom ?
who was here ?
i don' t know .
you were with someone .
laurel .
you had a woman here !
i can' t listen to these accusations .
you slept with someone here ?
leave me alone .
i can' t get into another big discussion of my life .
just because i was up here with someone talking , doesn' t mean we went to bed .
i am finished with this , lee .
you' re a fine one to talk .
what does that mean ?
you' d love to call it quits now your eye' s on someone else .
what ?
you throw yourself at melinda' s boyfriend .
don' t try and turn this around !
i' m amazed she tolerates it .
you' re mixing things up cos you were caught .
no , you were caught .
i know you when you slip into your seductive mode .
i' m not gonna have this stupid conversation !
don' t worry , i won' t be around much longer .
and then you can feel free to pursue whoever you want !
from that moment , the demons set in .
i just couldn' t sleep .
doesn' t matter how many pills i take .
i just feel myself consumed with suspicion and i' m ashamed of it .
melinda ...
cassie , you know it' s true .
i can see it in your face .
look , you have to pull yourself together .
you' ve been popping pills .
you' ve been drinking ...
stop avoiding answering me .
i don' t know anything .
i called ellis today .
he' s not where he said he' d be , so i called laurel' s school .
she' d called in sick .
clearly , she' s not home sick .
listen , even if your worst fears were true , you can' tjust go off the deep end .
i pick up the phone extension .
i have to know .
at the same time , i don' t wanna know .
listen , you cannot give yourself over to fantasies .
let' s find out the reality first , and stop drinking .
for god' s sakes , it' s not even noon yet .
god .
i have an appointment with your husband at noon .
well , you' re gonna be late .
i' m afraid the news is not good .
no ?
my partner gave it everything he had , but the politics of the situation is just too difficult .
your ex husband is very well connected and very determined to keep the children from you .
naturally , the criminal conviction didn' t help .
it' s funny .
i steeled myself for this result , but now that it' s come ...
you know , i know this will sound very pollyanna , but it' s true .
when they grow up , they will want to know who their mother was and get to know you .
my guess is they' il be quite angry at their father for his unreasonableness .
you' il see .
they' il grow up and come to you .
well , i' m certain that they will .
i' m sure that they' il take after me and look very much like my mother .
my mother was a very gifted interior decorator .
and i studied art , so i' ve always had this flair for graphics .
can i get you anything ?
no , i just hope that you' il be sending some of your clients to me when i get more established , you know .
did i tell you that my mother ... my mother ... my mother was a very gifted interior decorator ?
she was very talented .
she did some amazing houses on the upper west side .
melinda ...
there' s been no easy way to handle this situation .
i think we need to talk .
no , these situations are never easy .
i' m sorry , melinda .
i really am sorry .
it' s just ...
we planned to tell you , but each of us was so bewildered as how to approach it .
bewildered .
it' s not like we planned on it happening .
we were going to explain things as soon as we figured out the best approach .
i loved you .
i don' t have a satisfying explanation .
you know , these things happen .
living is messy .
my head is spinning .
i need to lie down and rest .
i wanna close my eyes and never open them again .
i' m going out the window .
ellis .
meli ...
what are you doing ?
i' m going out !
cassie ?
melinda has to come and stay with you for a while .
no , there is no other answer .
she has to be watched , and it' s awkward with me and ellis under the circumstances .
well , i can' t be responsible either .
let' s face it , cassie .
she' s one of those people who will always need help .
it' s sad , but we have to move on with our lives .
you killed her .
you killed her as i am about to kill you .
come , vitus .
are we men or are we children ?
of what use ...
so , what do you think ?
she' s gorgeous .
hard to believe a republican could be that sexual .
i bet she could put your portfolio in order .
i thought you didn' t like to dance .
i' m just trying to be a good sport .
i think it' d only be fair to tell you , i' m a liberal .
are you talking politically or in the bedroom ?
i was talking politically .
in the bedroom , i' m a left wing liberal .
in the bedroom , i' m a radical .
look , can i level with you ?
in the past few months of my marriage i really didn' t sleep with my wife .
we weren' t sleeping at all .
i ...
so it' s , ... you know .
i' m a little out of practice .
politically speaking , i' m ready for a little affirmative action .
what do you say we blow this joint and go back to your place ?
my place ?
yes , by all means .
it' d be great .
this is like a drea ...
so you' re not gonna hold the fact that we have conflicting viewpoints on the direction america should take against me ?
i mean , i' d hate to get all worked up and then we find we differ on a tax cut .
come on .
i haven' t made love in a while either .
yes .
i will never vote against school prayer again .
hey , what are they up to ?
what do you think ?
so much dancing .
that was so much fun .
you' il have to forgive the disarray .
my cleaning woman won $168 million in the lottery and she asked for the day off .
ajoke .
you must get depressed sleeping alone .
the truth is , i frighten myself .
i' m always worried burglars are gonna break in .
i bought a baseball bat .
oh , drinks .
i know the feeling of being dumped .
except in my case , it was between my fianc and my best friend .
no !
yes .
i' d known her all my life .
we were school mates .
we went through everything together .
she was the one who was responsible for my meeting my fianc .
it' s a sad story .
it' s awful .
do you mind sleeping on cotton sheets ?
i know you posed for playboy on satin .
i couldn' t help noticing how they' d always make eye contact .
i thought i was paranoid , but i should have trusted my instinct .
always go with your gut feeling .
sometimes i would pick up the phone after it would ring , and there' d be no one .
but they were signalling each other .
stacey .
making love , meeting secretly , laughing at me ...
i' m sure they weren' t laughing at you .
we were moving in together .
looking for an apartment together , to live together .
i loved him .
i' m sure .
my closest friend knew that .
she knew how much i cared about him .
she knew my whole life was wrapped up in him .
of course .
should i dim the lights ?
maybe a little jazz .
do you like jazz ?
i can' t bear it .
i can' t bear to think about it .
don' t think about it .
you know , life is so rotten , so cruel , and then , finally , about nothing .
we can just stretch out on the carpet if you ...
i can' t stand it !
i' m going out the window .
what ?
i' m going out the window .
stacey , wait !
are you crazy ?
stacey ...
stacey .
leave me alone .
i wanna end it all !
no , no , no !
stop it !
stop it !
stop it !
please !
let' s talk about what ...
jeez .
god !
please , let me go .
let me go !
kiss me .
i love you .
kiss me .
please .
my gosh .
what a dream .
melinda !
what ...
what are you doing here ?
my god .
i was listening at your door .
for what ?
i was jealous .
jealous ?
jealous of what ?
well ...
you went home with stacey , and all night long i' ve been upset .
so i guess i' ve realised how much i care for you .
really ?
is she here ?
i heard lovemaking talk .
no , that was a dream .
you were dreaming about her ?
i was dreaming of you , actually .
me ?
why were you dreaming about me ?
i dreamt i was making love to you .
really ?
melinda ...
i' m in love with you .
me ?
you never said anything .
i was married , and when it was breaking up you met bill .
my god .
couldn' t you tell i' ve been in love with you for a long time ?
i couldn' t even tell that i was in love with you .
and now you' re spying on me .
what a silly thing a grown woman , a mature , sophisticated woman , outside a door , spying .
by the way , i found a piece of your bathrobe in my door .
strange .
i should tell my laundress .
you don' t have a laundress .
well , marry me and we' il get a laundress .
so , you see , it' s all in the eye of the beholder .
we hear a little story , a few hearsay details .
you mould them into a tragic tale a woman' s weakness for romance is her undoing .
and that' s how you see life .
whereas you , you take those details , you put them into an amusing romance .
great .
that' s your take on life .
but , obviously , there is no one definitive essence that can be pinned down .
well , moments of humour do exist .
i exploit them .
but , you know , they exist within a tragic overall framework .
is everybody going to phil dorfman' s funeral next week ?
he dropped dead of a heart attack .
he just had his cardiogram , which was perfect .
i hate funerals .
me too .
always , at the wrong time , i laugh .
see , that' s my point .
we laugh because it masks our real terror about mortality .
i didn' t mean to bring up the subject of funerals .
well , how can it be a romantic , funny world if you can' t trust your own cardiogram ?
i wanna be cremated .
now ?
or after your death ?
let' s change the subject .
we came out to have a fun and relaxing evening .
let' s drink to good times .
comic or tragic , the most important thing to do is to enjoy life while you can because we only go round once , and when it' s over , it' s over .
and , perfect cardiogram or not , when you least expect it , it could end like that . ... like that !
