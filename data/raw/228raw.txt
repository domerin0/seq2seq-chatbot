we didn' t sink it .
whoosah .
all right , the positive .
thank god no cops died .
i got a police commissioner so far up my ass ... ... if he spits it' s coming out of my mouth .
but i know that there' s always two sides to a story .
so , what' s yours ?
well , i was at a family barbecue .
we got a tip that the zoepounders ... ... were gonna do a hit on cash or drugs from this big time x man .
that' s what they call a ecstasy dealer on the streets .
marcus , i know what they call them .
that' s why i' m captain .
it' s cool .
so you got the drugs .
no drugs .
oh , okay .
all right .
how about the money ?
no money .
nope .
then who is this x man ?
captain , i was at a family barbecue .
so i ...
we don' t know , but we are going to find out .
well , then all that ... ... was for nothing ?
we didn' t do all of that .
if you look close ...
watch .
hold up .

yeah , you' il get your money .
somebody' s on they way with your money .
is it possible we could discuss potential reimbursement ...
we don' t cover personal property .
that' s why we drive police cars .
so where do we go from here ?
zoepounders knew exactly when to hit the drop , where to hit the drop ... ... so we figure they know where the cash is .
we find the cash , we find the x man .
hey , i' m through playing games , all right ?
i have three cops critical .
i got kids dying on my streets from souped up x.
i do not want these animals taking over my city .
do you understand ?
so i want you guys to do whatever you do , whatever it takes , but do it now .
it' s not good , boss .
oh , my god .
fucking ratones eating my fucking money .
carlos , this is a stupid fucking problem to have .
but it is a problem nonetheless .
rat fuckers .
rat fuckers .
boss , it ended up crazy .
this black chica working for the russians was a maniac lunatic .
she saved your money .
she wasted some haitians and got the load to the drop .
also , roberto saw these two crazy gangbanger homeys .
oh , shit .
yeah .
chasing and shooting .
old days , did i have this problem ?

you look more like an angel .
what do you think , carlos ?
of course .
roberto , what do you think ?
it' s fucking beautiful .

so sad .
what' s so sad ?
your untreated control issues .
it' s not your fault .
what in the hell is that supposed to mean ?
your mama probably refused you her tit when you were a baby .
you grew up a malnourished high school softie .
got your gun , little tight t shirt ... ... and became a overcompensating tough guy .
that is the last time you will ever refer to my mother' s titties .
i don' t even want them up in your head .
you know , i said all that , mike , and all you heard was " titties .
man , you can' t keep suppressing my spiritual growth , mike .

last year he was awarded $9 million .
and got a dozen dumb ass officers like you fired .
well , he hasn' t run across us yet .
we' d love to hear what' s going on in that house .
use your computer brain and tap the phone .
well , that happens to be highly illegal without a judge .
we were thinking of something more along the lines of a training operation .

we' il plant a couple gypsy wires ... ... find out what tapia' s up to .
these are your basic household bugs .
dog , this is what we do .
what' s the sprayers for ?
the roaches .
roaches ?
we got rats .

get your head right .
mike , i' m a grown ass man .
get your grown ass self together and let' s do this .
you got a beautiful house , sir .
well , start looking .
they' re all over .
those ain' t normal rats .
what he means is that they' re obviously a special breed .
what kind of breed are they ?
big motherfuckers .
disposing of the rats isn' t a problem .
but we should ensure there' s no breeding elsewhere in the house .
yeah , at zook ... ... we like to work from the outside in , you know .
so we gonna leave these ...
excuse me .
we' il leave these here and send in a special unit .
it' d be better to begin in the rest of the house .
you' re not getting in the rest of the house .
we won' t be able to guarantee our work .
the only thing that we can guarantee ... ... is that these rats will keep fucking .
giving off offspring until we find the colony .
rats don' t got no stinking colony .
well , actually these are colonial rats .
what they do is they send out worker rats that are called ...
marsupials .
marsupials .
these drones , they' re explorers of the rat world , you know .
they just looking for rat pussy .
you know .
are you fucking with me ?
hold on .
you called us .
we can leave .
but what you should understand is that these rats will hump twice a day .
all right .
down there .
just kill them and bring me the bill .
that' s that bullshit .
that' s that bullshit right there .
you see these rats ?
plant your wires .
you' re not leaving me with them .
plant your wires .

especially russian middleman .
with all due respect , mr. tapia ... ... in my country , i see such things all the time .
i' m sorry for your country .
that must be some cuban stupid tradition to put them in a tortilla bin .
now , listen to me , you russian punk .
i , me , johnny tapia , will sever your head off !
you kill me and you will have a shit storm .
should i screw your young wife ... ... or visit your son , the soccer player ?
my daughter knows your son .
you' re gonna regret this .
i hope that we can remain friends .
because at the end , what else do we have but friendship , trust ... ... honor .
without this , we are no more than beasts .
the kitchen monitor' s out .
