my children ... from the very beginning ... it was the children who gave me my power .
the springwood slasher ... that' s what they called me .
my reign of terror was legendary .
dozens of children would fall by my blades .
then the parents of springwood came for me ...
taking justice into their own hands .
when i was alive , i might have been a little naughty ... but after they killed me ,
i became something much , much worse the stuff nightmares are made of .
the children still feared me ... and their fear gave me the power to invade their dreams .
and that' s when the fun really began !
until they figured out a way to forget about me ... to erase me completely !
being dead wasn' t a problem .
but being forgotten now , that' s a bitch !
it' s only a dream !
die , motherfucker !
i can' t come back if nobody remembers me !
i can' t come back if nobody' s afraid !
i had to search the bowels of hell ... but i found someone ... someone who' il make ' em remember .
he may get the blood , but i' il get the glory .
and that fear is my ticket home .
mike ?
is that you ?
all right , fuck you , then .
i' m heading in .
mike ?
come on , it' s not funny anymore .
no !
jason .
i should' ve been watching them , not drinking ... not meeting a boy at the lake .
i deserve to be punished .
we all deserved to be punished .
jason .
my special , special boy .
do you know what your gift is ?
no matter what they do to you ... you cannot die .
you can never die .
you' ve just been sleeping , honey .
but now the time has come to wake up .
mommy has something she wants you to do .
i need you to go to elm street .
the children have been very bad on elm street .
rise up , jason !
your work isn' t finished !
hear my voice and live again !
make them remember me , jason .
make them remember what fear tastes like .
i' ve been away from my children for far too long .
marry , fuck , or kill ?
your choices are your choices are the three stooges .
go , kia .
oh , god ...

but they asked me all these really weird questions ...

we interrupt this program for a special report .
after tonight' s murder ... in this neighborhood of springwood ... the sheriff' s department has confirmed ... that there is one victim ...

i gotta go to her .
i gotta see if she' s ok .

do you want me to start having nightmares again ?
don' t start with that dream demon shit again .
ok ?
you know that' s all just in your head .
yeah , yeah , and who are you , the poster boy for sanity ?
you' re the one that told the cops ...
lori' s dad killed his wife .
yeah , right , and now it looks like someone else ... got killed in the same house .
you think that' s a coincidence ?
two murders in one house ?
kurt , how many times do i have to tell you , man ?
i don' t do checkers .
i' m an uno guy , all right ?
so go grab the fucking uno deck and we' il play , ok ?

we' re stuck here .
we' re not going anywhere .
i do miss my family , man .
i mean , it' s been four years since i' ve seen ' em , you know .
all these years , and you' re still convinced ... you saw her father do that ?
i know what i saw , mark .

look at you .
you' re exhausted .
lori .
we need to get you to bed !
i don' t want to go to sleep , dad .
i just want to see my friends .
i don' t think it' s a good idea for you to go to school today .
you' ve just been through a very traumatic experience .
dad , please ...
i just need to get out of the house , ok ?
i' il be fine .
i promise .
well , at least drink your juice .

we' il find them .
keep this thing contained .
lori !
oh , my god !
god , you guys , i' m so glad you' re here .
blake' s dead , too .
what ?
yeah , he
he was stabbed to death late last night .
same with his dad .
what ?
shit , shit !
this is bullshit !
the police are blaming everything on blake ...
iike its some kind of columbine thing or something .
they' re saying he went crazy .
killed trey , killed his dad , and then took his own life ?
this is so fucking messed up .
this is messed up .
excuse me .
sorry .
lori ?
what is it , linderman ?
um , well , i heard what happened , and i just wanted to express how , um ... well , to tell you how sorry i was .
thank you .
that' s sweet .
right .
actually if you need anybody to talk to or maybe
whoa , linderman , let me give you a tip .
place your hormones back in the box ... and quit while you' re ahead , ok ?
we don' t have time for date a dork right now .
thanks .
right .
sorry .
i swear , every day it' s the same thing .
he' s like one of those fucking froufrou dogs ... that keeps humping your leg .
give a couple to some ladies .
thanks , man .
i see what you' re saying , gibb ... but that' s exactly why you should go .
i mean , be amongst friends , where it' s safe .
there' s gonna be a whole lot of loving there for you ... and my boy trey , all right ?
yeah .
yeah , you' re right .
i should go .
i could use a few dozen drinks .
that a girl .
let your freak flag fly .
see you there .
you want to go ?
no , i don' t think so .
i i didn' t get much sleep last night ... and when i did sleep ...
i had the most terrible nightmares .
lori , you had to sleep at a police station .
i' d have nightmares , too .
no , no , no , it wasn' t like that .
i mean , this was really real .
i mean , there was this man ... but he more like a monster really ... and they kept calling him freddy ...
and he was so real .
shh !
what did he look like ?
he he had this ... dark brown hat , and ... his skin was terribly burnt ... and on this right hand he had this like these ... razor fingers , and
you must be tripping .
no , no , no !
and then there were these little girls ...
it' s ok .
it was a bad dream .
they were singing like this this song like
one , two , freddy' s coming for you .
you know why they sing that ?
because that' s when he comes for you ... in your dreams .
you' re lucky to be alive .
who is he ?
he' s a child murderer ... that some parents from around here burned alive ... but then he came back .
back for revenge in our nightmares .
funny no one ever told us about him , huh ?
ok , thank you !
no !
you want some free advice ?
coffee .
make friends with it .
mark !
that' s enough .
you' re scaring her .
will ?
hey .
i thought you might be in trouble , so we
lori !
oh , my god !
lori , honey , wake up !
someone get help , please !
someone get some help , please !
the principal !
will , let' s go , let' s go !
please , somebody help her .
lori ?
how much longer is it gonna take ?
is she ok or what ?
shh !
tsk !
for nose jobs , what kind of anesthesia ... do the doctors use ?
they put you all the way under , right ?
got your nose !
strong work , man .
i came to make sure she' s ok ... and you put her in the infirmary .
what were you thinking about ... telling her all that stuff , man ?
i mean , we' re not in group .
because i' m thinking for the first time in my life ... that maybe i' m not crazy ... that my brother wasn' t crazy .
she had the same dream , will .
will rollins !
mark davis !
this doesn' t make any sense .
there' s nothing on krueger .
not his arrest , his death , not even a birth certificate .
whole sections of the records are gone .
look at all these blacked out obituaries .
january eighteenth .
that' s the day my brother committed suicide .
why isn' t that in here ?
i don' t know !
but i' m sure there' s a good reason .
remember in group when they told us ... not to jump to conclusions ?
listen to yourself .
you' re holding onto that psychobabble bullshit ...
iike it' s some kind of security blanket , man .
let it go .
they' ve covered him up , will .
they never told us about freddy ... because that' s how they decided to beat him .
they treated him like he was a fucking disease ... and they locked up all the kids ... who had made contact with him ... so they wouldn' t infect the others .
that' s crazy .
is it ?
how come we were never allowed ... to call any of our friends , man ?
how come none of our friends ever called us ?
we were in a fucking quarantine , man .
that' s what westin hills was for .
well , even if all you' re saying is true ... then why didn' t freddy kill lori ?
maybe he' s not strong enough yet .
my brother said it' s our fear that gives him his power .
yeah , well , you sure as hell ... spread enough fear today at school .
holy shit .
you' re right .
they wanted to forget freddy so they wouldn' t fear him .
what if i screwed up the town' s plan ?
fuck !
this fucker' s gonna spread like the plague , man !
kids are gonna start falling asleep , it' s gonna
let' s leave , man .
let' s leave right now .
no , i can' t leave .
why not ?
i gotta go talk to lori .
i gotta see if she' s ok .
well , is she worth dying for ?
because if you fall asleep , you ain' t waking up .
if that' s the case , how come you' re not dead ?
or any of the freaks at westin ?
when' s the last time you even had a nightmare ?
i don' t know .
i can' t remember my dreams anymore .
look , just give me one night , ok ?
just let me find lori , and then we' re out of here .
i swear .
all right .
if your ass isn' t back here by dawn , i' m gone .
we clear on that ?
this baby' s my brother' s pride and joy , so be careful .
oh , shit .
linderman !
shack , i don' t drink .
hi , lori .
didn' t think i' d see you here .
can i get you something to drink ?
smooth opening , but , you know , we' re already taken care of .
what happened to your clothes ?
oh , this .
i was playing a drinking game ... with some of the lower primates ... and i guess i' m penalized for my ability ... to read above a fourth grade level .
linderman , you know , i always pictured you ... as a straight up bedwetter .
you know what , kia ?
i used to think you hated me ... because you thought i wasn' t good enough for lori ... but that' s not it .
you tear me down to make yourself feel better ... because you really hate yourself ... which is kind of pathetic when you actually ... stop and think about it , assuming , of course ... you can think with all that makeup ... weighing down your head .
the cops said blake committed suicide .
apparently , it was grief over trey .
no , man , that' s bullshit .
i heard some guy krueger killed them both .
said his name to my parents , they almost shit themselves .
yeah , yeah , yeah , man , and i heard ... that freddy freak , he used to live here .
fucking gutted trey like a goddamn turkey , man .
like i heard his intestines and shit was on the floor
oh , shit .
i' m sorry .
oh , my god .
look who' s here .
look who' s here !
what are you looking at ?
come on , come on , let' s dance .
come on , linderman , let' s go .
where have you been , will ?
didn' t you get my letters ?
what letters ?
they must' ve never even mailed them .
who ?
the ... doctors at westin hills .
i' ve been in a psychiatric hospital .
mark was with me there .
some other kids , too .
i don' t understand .
well , i saw on the news the other night ...
i mean , that kid that was killed at your house .
i mean , i needed to know that you were safe .
what happened ?
i don' t know .
i don' t know .
nobody knows .
nobody saw what happened ... and the police have been acting really weird ...
iike they know something ... and i heard them mention some name .
some ...
freddy .
freddy krueger .
where was your dad ?
out of town .
are you sure ?
what is going on , will ?
well , look , four years ago , i thought l
enough with this bullshit talk .
let' s go shake our ass on the dance floor .
come on !
i' m dead one day ... and you' re already out getting shit faced ?
same old gibb !
trey , l i can' t believe it .
come on , let' s go .
babe , don' t make me ask you twice , ok ?
now !
trey ?
no !
open the door !
please , the door
no !
no !
you' re the one that killed trey !
oh , don' t worry about my little errand boy .
the only to fear is fear himself !
no !
she' s mine .
mine !
mine !
this everclear is kicking my ass .
this
check out this fucking guy .
well , hey , jethro !
this is a rave , not a halloween party .
why don' t you go find yourself a pig to fuck ?
yeah !
invite only , cornpoke , and you weren' t invite
son of a bitch .
yeah !
burn , motherfucker !
no !
run , man , run !
freak !
you killed my brother !
gibb !
oh , my god !
oh , gibb !
no !
let' s go !
let' s go , come on !
was that him ?
the guy you were talking about freddy krueger .
no , that wasn' t the guy in my dream .
that was somebody else !
who cares about some fucking dream guy , ok ?
that psycho in the hockey mask was real .
dude , that goalie was pissed about something .
we need to find the police .
no , no !
fuck the police !
just take me home , will .
gibb , l
i can' t believe she ...
i know .
look , call me later , ok ?
please .
just to check in .
bye , will .
be careful .
will , i' m gonna go inside now .
i think that' s the last thing you should do right now .
oh , will , please .
after everything that' s happened ...
i just want to go to
there' s more to it than that .
look , i tried to tell you this earlier .
the reason i was sent to westin ... is because i saw your dad kill your mom .
will , my mom died in a car accident .
no , that' s what he wanted you to believe ... but i was there , lori .
i was sneaking up to your room , like i used to do .
only you weren' t there .
i saw him kill her .
dad !
get out of the van .
get out of the van !
where were you ?
what are you doing ?
i' ve been looking all over for you !
get away from her !
you' re in a helluva lot of trouble , you know that ?
like i give a shit anymore .
get in the house !
you !
i' m taking you back to westin .
no !
no way !
you can' t trust him , lori .
whatever you do , don' t go home with him !
no , listen to me !
he was the one who had me committed !
you didn' t understand .
you still don' t .
you were confused !
stop it !
both of you , stop it !
damn it , will !
i am not gonna let you ... endanger my daughter again !
not after everything that' s happened !
stop it !
stop it !
fuck !
lori !
i l
did mom die in a car accident ?
yes .
of course she did .
prove it .
show me a death certificate .
show me an autopsy report .
lori , i don' t think now is the right time
really , dad ?
because i think it' s a perfect time !
why didn' t you tell me about westin hills ?
do you work there ?
because i thought you were a fucking general practitioner !
yes , i ...
i do some consulting there now , but ... it' s it isn' t what you think .
oh , my god .
so you knew about will this whole time .
lori , listen to me .
you' re upset .
we both are .
now i think what you need now ... more than anything is to get some rest .
why don' t i give you some pills ... and that' il help you sleep ... and then we talk about it in the morning ?
i don' t want to sleep , dad !
i want to know why you' ve been lying to me !
we' il talk about it in the morning !
now do what i say !
lori !
lori !
open this door .
open this door !
go away !
damn it , lori !
let me in !
goddamn it !
it' s ok , it' s me .
it' s me , shh !
shh !
you ok ?
are you ok ?
it' s me , all right ?
i don' t know how your father' s connected to all this ... but i think mark was right .
there' s some kind of cover up going on here with krueger .
we can' t trust the police .
we can' t trust any of the adults .
so what do we do ?
we gotta get to mark .
he' s the expert in all of this .
he' il know what' s going on .
you always looked out for me , bro .
hey , mark .
i gotta stay awake .
shit !
hey , mark .
you didn' t forget about me , did you ?
oh , god .
oh , that' s right !
everyone forgot !
that' s why they weren' t afraid anymore !
that' s why i needed jason to kill for me ... to get them to remember .
but now he just won' t stop , that hockey puck !
this isn' t ... real .
somebody , please , wake me up !
please !
mark !
mark , wake up !
i need you to send a little message for me .
that' s all , just a little message .
i' m not gonna do it .
i won' t do it !
no ? !
i won' t do it .
i' il have to pass that message myself , won' t l ?
oh , my god !
let go of me !
help ... me .
mark !
pass on a little message for me , will ya ?
sheriff , i' ve been compiling info ... based on eyewitness reports of the hockey mask killer .
we already know who did this .
sheriff , we closed down the school ... and set up a curfew for anyone under eighteen .
good .
now i want twenty four hour roadblocks set up .
nobody leaves town , nobody gets in .
we' re gonna contain this son of a bitch ... before he spreads any further .
yes , sir .
sir , shouldn' t we have the f. b. i. come in and
no outsiders , stubbs .
we can handle this .
we' ve stopped him before .
ok , i' m a little lost here .
stopped who before ?
we don' t say his name out loud .
you' re not from around here .
i don' t expect you to understand .
with all due respect , sheriff ...
i think we have a copycat of the old jason voorhees ...
crystal lake killer on our hands
you listen to me .
we do things around here a certain way for a reason ... and that' s given us four years of peace .
so you either do your job and keep your mouth shut ... or , so help me god , i will lock you up !
do you understand me ? !
yes , sir .
why don' t we all just leave ?
no , even if we leave , freddy can still get us .
we all know about him .
we' re all afraid of him .
it was our fear that gave him his power .
we' re marked now .
man , screw that clown .
i mean , what kind of a pussy ... comes after you in your dreams anyway ?
now , that big ass mother fucker back at the cornfield ... all right , that' s who we should be afraid of .
tell me who the fuck that was .
his name was jason voorhees .
shit , man ... um ...
how' d you know we were here ?
nothing personal , but the scooby van out back ... wasn' t exactly subtle .
and never keep your keys in the door .
great , so now we' re completely fucked .
no , you' re not .
i' m here to help you .
now , this jason voorhees supposedly drowned ... at camp crystal lake back in 1957 ... when he was eleven years old .
the counselors weren' t watching him ... then they made the mistake of killing his mother .
the legend has it ... that jason kept returning from his grave ... to punish whoever returned to the camp .
i think we' re dealing with a copycat here .
no .
no .
no , no , no .
he' s not a copycat .
i' ve seen what he can do .
he' s the real jason .
that' s impossible , linderman .
jason is dead .
you' d better start thinking outside your little box , dude ...
' cause somebody' s definitely breaking ... the fucking reality rules , ok ?
it makes sense in a way .
i mean , what if freddy brought jason back ... because he was too weak to go after us on his own ... so he used jason .
i mean , he knew that we' d think it was him ... that we' d spread the fear again .
and now that it' s working ... it' s like he can' t shut jason back down .
wait a minute .
freddy died by fire , jason by water .
how can we use that ?
i think we should concentrate on jason first .
but i thought we decided ... that freddy was the one pulling the strings .
shouldn' t we go after him first ?
i don' t know , maybe what we need to do is ... to offer freddy a sacrifice .
yeah , yeah , totally .
like a virgin , right ?
someone pure .
dude , don' t look at me .
even if you pay for it , it still counts .
oh , come on .
look , we all know who the real virgin is here .
kia !
oh , come on , lori .
i know you never made it with will .
why would he want to when he can fuck somebody like me ?
let' s tie the bitch up .
what ?
don' t worry , angel .
you' ve still got me .
come on , give daddy a kiss .
your eyes say no no ... but my mouth says yes yes .
lori , are you all right ?
you fell asleep .
oh , shit !
i pulled that out of my dream .
how is that possible ?
anything is possible now !
god , you just don' t get it !
oh , god , y' all , two killers ?
we' re not safe awake or asleep .
it' s not the sleep that' s killing us ... it' s our dreams .
at westin , mark and i never had dreams .
were you on any drugs ?
yeah , but there' s something called hypnocil .
they never told us what it was for ... but everyone there was taking it .
experimental drug ... not even approved yet by the f. d. a.
oh , shit .
used for ... suppression of dreams .
we need those pills , enough for all of us .
can you get us back to westin hills ?
