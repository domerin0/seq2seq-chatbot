<i>hello .
albert markovski . </ i>
<i>i have a 1 : 00 appointment . </ i>
sorry , i' m late .
this place is like a maze .
have a seat .
we' il be right with you .
why don' t you just tell me what your situation is .
look , i' m not really sure i know exactly what you guys do here , all right ?
well , we , uh ...
we' il investigate and solve your case .
how ?
if you sign a contract , we' il follow you .
you' il spy ?
yes .
on me ?
yes .
<i> will you be spying on me in the bathroom ? </ i>
yes .
in the bathroom ?
yes .
<i> why ? </ i>
there' s nothing too small .
you know when police find the slightest bit of d. n. a. and build a case ?
if we might see you ... you floss or masturbate ... that could be the key to your entire reality .
so i' m hiring you to spy on me .
that' s right .
so we can figure out your situation and resolve your crisis .
in addition , my associate will approach your case from a different angle .
what do you mean a different angle ?
what does that mean ?
regarding your perception of reality .
he' il tell you about that .
who sent you here ?
nobody .
i found your card .
where ?
in some fancy restaurant that i' d never been to before .
<i>i didn' t have the proper attire . </ i>
<i>so they let me borrow a suitjacket . </ i>
<i>i reached into my pocket, </ i> <i>and there was your card . </ i>
<i>the weird thing is</ i> <i>i always have a jacket . </ i>
<i> [ woman ]
but not that day ? </ i>
<i> no . </ i>
<i> brad stand . </ i>
hey .
<i> kind of a coincidence . </ i>
yes , exactly .
my case is a coincidence .
<i> about the restaurant and thejacket ? </ i>
no , no .
that that' s ...
i' m talking about a big coincidence .
it involves one man .
it' s a three parter .
okay .
ready ?
first part .
i went to a place called schottinger' s photo archives .
<i>i was there getting stills</ i> <i>of early bob dylan . </ i>
<i>in comes this tall african guy . </ i>
<i>he' s like 18 years old or something . </ i>
<i>you know , he' s in there getting photos</ i> <i>of morris chestnut ... </ i>
<i>shaquille o' neal, </ i> <i>jim carrey . </ i>
<i>he' s an autograph hound . </ i>
<i>kind of guy likes to get ... </ i> glossies of famous people and get them signed .
<i>two weeks later , i see</ i> <i>the same african guy . </ i>
<i>he' s working as a doorman</ i> <i>at my friend' s building . </ i>
oh , my god !
who' s your friend ?
jay wendorff .
but it' s not his apartment .
it' s his girlfriend' s .
what' s her name ?
uh , kelly .
kelly coulter .
so , okay , that' s two .
<i>one time at schottinger' s</ i> <i>photo archive ... </ i> <i>second time</ i> <i>as the doorman . </ i>
third , i see this man , he' s in a van at the mall .
<i> what are you doing at the mall ? </ i>
i' m working .
<i> i' m making a statement for the open spaces . </ i>
<i> [ horn honking ] </ i>
<i>yeah , he' s back . </ i>
<i>you crazy bastard . </ i>
you don' t plant no tree in this parking lot !
<i>i gotta come take that tree, </ i> <i>remove it and let traffic through . </ i>
<i>you' rejust creatin' </ i> <i>more work for me . </ i>
they' re not always meaningful .
yeah , it' s meaningful .
<i> meaningful how ? </ i>
that' s what i want you to find out .
about your life .
yeah , about my life .
and about the whole thing .
about the universe , you know ?
the big one .
<i>i mean , should i keep doing</ i> <i>what i' m doing ?
is it hopeless ? </ i>
mr. markovski , we see a lot of people in here ... who claim they want to know the ultimate truth about reality .
they want to peer under the surface at the big everything ... but this can be a very painful process full of surprises .
it can dismantle the world as you know it .
<i>that' s why most people prefer to remain</ i> <i>on the surface of things . </ i>
maybe you should go home .
let sleeping dogs lie .
take it easy .
what do you say ?
i say don' t give me the brush off .
please .
i want to know .
this is big .
have you ever transcended space and time ?
<i> yes .
no . </ i>
uh , time not space .
no , i don' t know what you' re talking about .
i take it you don' t make very much money , mr. markovski .
<i>is that gonna be a problem ? </ i>
<i>are you expensive , what you do ? </ i>
<i>we have a sliding scale . </ i>
<i>some of our clients pay $30 a week . </ i>
some of our wealthy clients pay several thousand a week .
i can' t believe you guys actually exist .
how long have you been doing this ?
<i> seventeen years , 352 cases . </ i>
that' s crazy .
i' m gonna have to ask you to please steer clear of my office ... because my work situation is a little shaky , all right ?
you want us to stay away from your job ?
yeah .
if you come snooping around my office ... it could make me look unstable and it could hurt me .
i want you to meet my colleague .
bernard ?
uh huh .
this is mr. markovski .
hi .
he' s going to have to be pro bono .
okay .
sounds good .
<i>thank you very much</ i> <i>for taking on my case . </ i>
oh , you' re welcome .
you' re welcome .
hold on .
he hasn' t signed a contract .
let' s do this and then we' il get to the contract .
it' s too much too soon .
it' s always too much too soon .
that' s the nature of the beast .
approach , patience , finesse .
will you stop ?
come on .
we need to start with his specifics , bernard .
we need to go past logic though .
come on .
let' s go .
give me a kiss .
come on .
okay .
will you tell me where we' re having dinner tonight ?
korean barbecue .
really ?
<i>okay , let' s get started . </ i>
is this part of my investigation ?
yes .
say this blanket represents all the matter and energy in the universe , okay ?
you , me , everything .
nothing has been left out , all right ?
all the particles , everything .
what' s outside this blanket ?
more blankets .
that' s the point .
blanket' s everything .
exactly .
this is everything .
let' s just say that this is me , all right ?
and i' m , what , 60 odd years old and i' m wearing a gray suit .
blah , blah , blah .
and let' s say over here , this is you .
and , you' re ...
i don' t know , you' re 21 .
you got dark hair , etc .
and over here , this is vivian , my wife and colleague .
then over here , this is the eiffel tower , right ?
it' s paris .
and this is a war .
and this is , uh , a museum .
and this is a disease .
and this is an orgasm .
and this is a hamburger .
everything is the same even if it' s different .
exactly .
but our everyday mind forgets this .
we think everything is separate .
limited .
i' m over here .
you' re over there .
which is true .
but it' s not the whole truth because we' re all connected .
because we ... are connected .
sure .
sure .
sure .
sure .
okay ?
yeah .
all right , now , we need to learn ... how to see the blanket truth all the time .
right in the everyday stuff .
and that' s what this is for .
why ?
why what ?
why do i need to learn how to see the blanket thing all the time in the everyday stuff ?
you wouldn' t want to miss out on the big picture , would you ?
uh uh .
that' s partly why you' re here , right ?
and this is it .
i' m talking about it right now .
it will take a while for you to get it , you know ?
but ... it will help you .
<i> [ zipper unzipping ] </ i>
how ?
when you get the blanket thing you can relax ... because everything you could ever want or be , you already have and are .
that sound pretty good ?
that sounds very good .
all right , get in .
you want me to get in ?
so , get in here ?
yeah .
what' s going to happen to me in there ?
oh , hey , you' re gonna see .
you' il find out .
<i>the purpose of this suit , mr. markovski, </ i> <i>is to help shut down ... </ i> <i>your everyday perceptions</ i> <i>and give up your usual identity ... </ i>
<i> that you think separates you from everything . </ i>

so what' s the open spaces take on that ?
well , i think you guys can definitely rebuild in areas ... that are already run down instead of tearing up new land .
<i> [ albert' s voice ]
new land .
new land . </ i>
we' re open to that .
that' s who we are at open spaces .
we can' t throw that away .
we' re not asking you to throw that away .
i' m not gonna bullshit you , right ?
part of this is we took a beating in the press for all our growth .
opening so many stores in such a short time .
so if we work with you and your open spaces coalition ... is that gonna help the huckabees image ?
yes .
does it help me ?
yes .
do i benefit from getting some great p. r. for huckabees when we need it ?
absolutely .
but do i care about saving the open spaces ?
yes , i do .

i' m lucky if i last another day !
we can solve your case sooner if you' re straight with us .
i' m being straight with you .
brad smeared me ... and took the coalition in a different direction .
that' s straight .
<i> at schottinger' s photo archive</ i> <i>where you met mr. nimieri ... </ i>
who' s mr<i> ...
</ i> who' s that ?
the african guy .
<i> that' s the african guy from my coincidence . </ i>
this is what i wanna talk about .
<i> it wasn' t your first time at schottinger' s , was it ? </ i>
did i say it was ?
you did .
you agree it wasn' t ?
<i>sure .
it wasn' t my first time . </ i>
<i>big deal . </ i>
it was more like a regular thing with you .
and you weren' t finding a still of bob dylan .
you were planting photos of yourself in the archive .
what are you getting at ?
<i> why would you do something like that ? </ i>
<i>to be noticed . </ i>
<i>maybe urgently . </ i>
<i> maybe , yeah . </ i>
<i> uh huh . </ i>
how did that affect things with brad at the coalition ?
how did it affect things at the coalition ?
i don' t know .
you know , it was a drag .
it really was a drag .
because i wanted my poems to go out with the fund raiser mailing .
brad didn' t .
he was all obsessed with shania and pete sampras .
not what we were really supposed to be focusing on ... hurt .
you planted photos of yourself and your poems at schottinger' s .
brad didn' t respect you .
no , he didn' t .
and yet you brought him into the open spaces coalition .
why is that ?
i needed the sponsor to take my cause to another level .
that' s why .
why else would i do it ?
like we said .
to be noticed .
this is absurd .
show me my folder .
no .
that is not productive .
at the photo archive , you spent a lot of time ...
iooking at old jessica lange bathing suit stills , why ?
<i>that' s only because lange</ i> <i>comes before markovski . </ i>
i was putting my head shots under markovski , and then " l " is right before it .
i might' ve looked at a little bit of lange on the way out .
what' s the big deal ?
<i> albert , baby , come on . </ i>
what , is it a crime ?
is it a crime to look at lange ?
<i> [ vivian ]
have you ever been in love ? </ i>
what kind of question is that ?
do you even believe in love ?
<i> or do you only have fantasy relationships ... </ i> because anything else would be too painful ?
bernard , excuse me .
but i' m making some progress here .
so am i , darling .
so am i.
<i>oh , no , no .
i' m not going in that thing . </ i>
<i>every time i go in there ... </ i> it' s all hating faces that i have to chop up with a machete .
<i>and then they multiply . </ i>
<i>and we' re going to address that right now . </ i>
okay ?
i' il leave it to you .
<i>come on .
you can' t retreat . </ i>
<i>back into the fray , albert .
let' s go . </ i>
i' m in your corner .
<i>[ heart beating ] </ i>
<i>okay , albert , i want you to melt</ i> <i>your usual identity like you did before . </ i>
<i> [ woman laughing ] </ i>
stop looking at me .
i said stop looking at me .
dawn is gonna love doing spots for the open spaces .
who' s dawn ?
miss huckabees .
dawn .
she loves your poems .
the one about the rock .
nobody sits like this rock sits .
that' s the one .
she loves poems .
she loves forests , meadows , getting outside .
we' il just throw thejet skis on the trailer and head to the mountains .
wait , you guys ...
you go with misshuckabees ?
she was doing some print work for us ...

<i>forget brad .

<i>where are you ?

<i>albert . </ i>
<i>picture a tree in a field . </ i>
<i>good .
now put someone</ i> <i>you respect in the tree . </ i>
hey , dickweed .
<i> [ albert ]
still brad stand . </ i>
<i> add someone else . </ i>
<i> like who ? </ i>
<i>you know , someone who can understand</ i> <i>things .
someone who can help you . </ i>
<i> who' s your guide ? </ i>
well , i use magritte , a belgian surrealist .
<i> i got someone . </ i>
<i> who is it ? </ i>
<i>mrs .
schirmir .
she was my high school</ i> <i>english teacher .
she helped me . </ i>
<i> all right , good . </ i>
<i> he pushed her out of the tree . </ i>
<i>okay , mrs. schirmir has a vacuum cleaner, </ i> <i>albert , that sucks up fear . </ i>
<i>now she' s going to send you</ i> <i>rays of security and complete acceptance . </ i>
<i>he chopped her head off ! </ i>
hold on .
hold on .
hold on .
you' re doing well .
now , don' t give up now .
didn' t she vacuum a lot ?
but then he vacuumed her .
i had to chop him up with a machete .
okay , albert .
i can let you in on a couple of secrets .
one , your mind is always occupied on something ... so it may as well be something helpful like mrs. schirmir and her vacuum cleaner .
two , there is no such thing as you and me .
so then there' s just nothing ?
three , there' s no such thing as nothing .
there is no remainder in the mathematics of infinity .
there' s only the blanket .
i thought i understood the blanket .
now i' m not sure .
<i>flags and bags . !
huckabees says, </ i> <i>" happy birthday , mr. president . " </ i>
50 % off all knapsacks and pocketbooks .
oh , say , can you see how good this looks ?
let freedom ring .
at huckabees ... the everything store .
huckabees cornucopia of stuff we all want .
but what happened to the gazelles ?
were they squashed ... under the cd department ?
hey , albert , how' s it goin ' ?
what are you doing here , brad ?
i met brad when i was investigating you .
he called with his own existential conundrum .
that' s all .
i' m really glad i found out about these people .
<i> that' s bullshit . </ i>
he doesn' t care about things like this .
bring me the african guy .
where' s that african guy ?
dude , what' re you talking about ?
<i> why does he get to write poetry ? </ i>
there' s no gazelles in north america .
just so you know .
and that building squashing nature is my imagery .
you don' t write poetry .
<i>[ bernard ] </ i>
<i>everyone' s intake procedure is different . </ i>
i asked brad to write a poem .
<i>and it wasn' t enough that</ i> <i>you came to my coalition ... </ i> now you have to come here and do ...
okay , okay .
<i>[ bernard ] </ i>
<i>all right , that' s good . </ i>
we' re the same , brad .
it' s all the blanket .
<i>there you go . </ i>
<i>give it a shot . </ i>
that is wonderful , albert .
<i> oh , honey , he' s got it . </ i>
how are things at the coalition , brad ?
great .
much smoother .
<i>great , i look forward to coming back</ i> <i>and working with you . </ i>
i don' t think that' s going to happen , my friend .
<i>i' m still in the charter . </ i>
<i>i built the coalition from scratch . </ i>
yeah .
yeah .
well , i don' t want to cramp you here .
<i>that' s what you mean to do . ! </ i>
<i>that' s exactly what you mean to do . ! </ i>
what ?
what ?
what ?
you see what he' s doing ?
tell them what you' re doing .
what ?
he' s come here to conquer you like he conquered my coalition .
<i>and now he' s here today to unnerve me so</ i> <i>that when orrin comes to town , i will blow it . </ i>
that' s what you mean to do .
<i> albert , please . ! </ i>
oh , my god , brad .
you' re killing me .
<i> what are you talking about ? </ i>
<i>what am i talking ... </ i>
<i>okay , when orrin comes , i' il blow it . </ i>
i' il get kicked out , and then he can do whatever he wants with the coalition .
who' s orrin ?
<i> orrin is the open spaces national director . </ i>
he' s coming to review our charter .
i hope this isn' t about dawn .
he has a crush on my girlfriend .
that' s crazy !
why do you stare at her ?
<i> she' s a model . ! </ i>
<i> [ brad laughs ] </ i>
i' m going home .
<i> oh , no . !
albert , please . </ i>
<i>stay with us for mancala hour . </ i>
i' m gonna have a fucking ball at mancala hour , aren' t i ?
maybe albert should meet his other .
what ?
tommy ?
no , that' s a bad idea right now .
<i>yes , a dicey move .
maybe even dangerous, </ i> <i>but potentially inspired . </ i>
bernard , give them both a connection .
maybe , but tommy' s in a bad direction .
it could spread to albert .
you said tommy was gonna be fine .
what are you leaving out ?
nothing .
give him his other .
it' s an inspired idea .
it' s groovy .
the connection will come back to us , bernard .
it all comes around .
like you say , take the long view .
long view .
what' s the other ?
we' re going to find out right now .
shh . <i> ?
<i> [ man ]
there was a drought . </ i> <i> ?
<i> there was no crop . </ i> <i> ?
<i>no olives . </ i>
no soul of life .
no rabbit in the oven .
we mashed locusts and made bread .
i have no idea what you guys are talking about .
i thought we were going to talk about petroleum .
<i>mrs .
echevarria visits us</ i> <i>once a year from spain . </ i>
she' s sort of a little treat for our clients .
a kind of spiritual petit four .
something that would be useful for you to be accustomed to .
yeah , a real treat .
you have received your answer .
senorita , the petroleum situation was not created by nature ...
like the drought or the olives or any of that .
it was created by people , and this is the facts .
it was created by people who act like nothing' s happening ...
and that' s causing all the problems .
no , no , tommy .
one question only<i> .
uno . </ i>
okay .
here' s the question ...
no , no .
i think ...
you' ve had your question and the answer , tommy , please .
senora is tired .
senorita , why do people only ask themselves deep questions ... when something really bad happens ?
then they forget all about it after .
right ?
how come people are self destructive ?
<i>and third, </ i> <i>i refuse to use petroleum ... </ i> but there' s no way i can stop its use in my lifetime , is there ?
jimmy carter would have a great electric car by now .
i could have a cadillac escalade , and it would be electric .
i wouldn' t have to ride on my bicycle .
that is three questions .
i paid my money and i want a fucking answer .
so just give me a second .
<i>i know , dear boy .
we wanted</ i> <i>you to meet albert . </ i>
i thought you said next week .
it turns out he can use a connection sooner than later .
tommy has been working with us since that ...
the big september thing .
he' s going to be your other .
what is it exactly ?
like a buddy system i think .
<i>when we dismantle, </ i> <i>it can get kind of rough .
and it helps ... </ i> to have a friend going through the same .
do you drive a car ?
a bike .
sometimes i take the bus .
good .
that' s good .
i like that .
i can see why they put us together .
tommy corn .
albert markovski .
i' il be your other .

<i>[ chattering ] </ i>
what' s happening with your case ?
i don' t know .
what do you mean ?
they won' t let me see my coincidence file .
you want them to solve a coincidence ?
that' s why you came here ?
yeah , that' s why i came here .
who' s the girl ?
<i>the face of huckabees . </ i>
tops and mops ?
that' s her .
i doubt your coincidence is meaningful .
why ?
i have a book by a french thinker named caterine vauban .
she says the same thing they say here about dismantling your reality to see the big picture .
what' s the difference ?
here , they say everything' s connected in the blanket .
vauban says nothing' s connected .
it' s all random and cruel .
it doesn' t matter what you do .
that' s nihilism , tommy !
they find it threatening .
but it is very convincing .
you know , my ex girl won' t let me see my daughter .
she' s brainwashing her not to think or feel .
<i> what kind of reality is that ? </ i>
not this one .
<i>exactly .
i think you shouldjust look</ i> <i>in your file if you want to . </ i>
how am i gonna look at my file ?
you wanna see your file ?
i' il distract them .
you slip in for it .
act naturally .
here comes your boy .
hey , you play mancala ?
didn' t know you were interested in existential issues , brad .
why ?
' cause i' m a dumb sales executive instead of a sensitive artist like you ?
no , i just never heard you talk about it .
that' s all .
why do you think i joined the open spaces coalition , man ?
i thought you cared about the issues .
i do .
obviously you had a different agenda , didn' t you ?
what books do you read ?
<i> what books do i read ? </ i>
philjackson' s <i>sacred hoops . </ i>
<i>really .
i read the galleys when it arrived</ i> <i>at huckabees , and you know what ? </ i>
seriously , that book' s got some good questions .
you should read it .
isn' t it sports questions in that book ?
no , wise ass .
philjackson' s a smart guy .
all right , come on .
it was an honest question , brad .
felt a little hostile .
i feel the same thing from him .
who the hell are you ?
who the hell are you ?
you wanna go ?
get out of here man .

steven , how' d you end up working as a doorman ?
it is our immigration agreement .
we must work .
the building supervisor hired steven as a member of our congregation .

<i> i don' t want to hear it again . </ i>

there aren' t lions roaming here but there were in sudan , and the orphan boys got chased .

<i>[ albert ]
you mean</ i> <i>the existential detectives ? </ i>
sounds like a support group .
why can' t he use a church ?
<i>sometimes people</ i> <i>have additional questions to be answered . </ i>
like what ?
well , um , for instance ...
if the forms of this world die , which is more real ... the me that dies or the me that' s infinite ?
can i trust my habitual mind or do i need to learn to look beneath those things ?
<i>sounds like we got</ i> <i>a philosopher . </ i>
<i>we don' t have to ask those kinds</ i> <i>of questions , do we , mom ? </ i>
no , honey .
what happened to the cat , albert ?
h how' d you know about my cat ?
the cat was killed by curiosity .
right .
that cat .
what do you do ?
i' m the director of the open spaces coalition .
we fight suburban sprawl .
what' s suburban sprawl ?
ask steven .
he could have used a little suburban sprawl in sudan .

and yeats ?
theodore roosevelt ...
henry david thoreau , robinson jeffers , the national geographic society , all socialists ?
you' re talking about socialism .

you caught me .
you' re amazing .
the method worked .

<i>what method ? </ i>
<i>come on with that method . </ i>
that' s a tranquilizer so people don' t get pissed ... about the painful , ugly truth ... you know it .

good job , albert .
can it be taped ?
excuse me , brad .
i would like to finish reading my poem , please .
thank you .
relax .
not doing your poem .
don' t give me the relax thing , brad .
let him read the poem , man .
he was in the middle of it .
that man is not in our coalition .
he has no right to be here and no right to speak .
no , ma' am , i' m not a member , but i am a local firefighter .
he' s a great firefighter and exactly who we want on our side .
i don' t know who these men are .
they' re not members of our coalition .
they' re working on the benefit .
they' re bringing a lot of support for our cause .
conflict is an illusion .
shut up , brad .

<i>why are you guys wasting all</ i> <i>your time fighting each other ? </ i>

hey , come on .
that' s bullshit .
congratulations .
be strong .
be strong ' cause you' re going to be back .
don' t worry about those people .
they don' t appreciate you .
albert , what happened in there is reality .
it' s cruelty and it' s chaos .
the detectives are wrong .
what were you trying to do ?
you were trying to do a good thing , right ?
well , look what happened .
i' m going to the other side , albert .
i seriously suggest ... you consider coming with me ... as my other .
albert ...
you' re wrong !
you' re full of shit .
you guys got nothing to offer , man .
<i> tommy , no ... </ i>
this is the money right now .
yes ?
<i> no . ! </ i>
you know how hurt you feel ?
this is the perfect opportunity to dismantle now .
stay away from me !
stop !
look !
listen !
throughout infinity ... your energy recycles into every possible relation ... to everyone else' s energy , even brad' s .
<i>you' ve been predator</ i> <i>and prey with him . </ i>
friends , enemies , brother , sister , mother , child .
i give and i give and i give ... and he takes and he takes and he takes .
mama .
all right , baby .
all right .
yahhh !
it' s a romantic fantasy .
and you left that part out , okay ?
when you were taking my cash .
i want it back .
yeah , and if i wasn' t pro bono , i' d want my money back too .
send it to my ex for my kids .
hey , sign your bike out .
sign your bike out !
tommy , come on !
go !
i' il block for you .
cocksucker !
motherfucking bitch ass motherfucking cocksucker !
you' re all a bunch of big babies !
maybe i should just quit .
i mean , what' s the point of life anyway ?
i can answer these questions for you .
you can ?
because i don' t think the other guys are doing such a hot job .
believe me , i can .
you' re the writer tommy' s into ?
are you unhappy with their work ?
yeah , i' m ready to cross over to your side .
tell me about your case .
well , you seem to be following me pretty closely .
why don' t you tell me about it ?
you are miserable .
obsessed with your strange coincidence .
yeah .
yeah , but they just want to talk about brad stand .
they betrayed you , as he did .
that' s right .
betrayal embodies the universal truth you seek .
what truth ?
cruelty , manipulation ... meaninglessness .
yeah .
did they follow you ?
no .
i lost them on route 4 .
thanks for helping me out back there .
no problem .
glad you' re here , albert .
this is the place to be .
once you realize the universe sucks , you got nothing to lose .
that' s what gives you <i>la force . </ i>
the force ?
<i> la force .
</ i> it' s french for strength .
<i> la force . </ i>
you guys got a method here ?
<i>yeah .
deconstruct your mind</ i> <i>to the blackness , okay ? </ i>
just accept it for what it is .
nothing .
there' s no glowing guys , no infinite mothers .
none of that bullshit .
my coincidence is meaningless , isn' t it ?
<i>think , albert .
have</ i> <i>you betrayed yourself ? </ i>
<i>[ albert ]

<i>what are we doing here ? </ i>
i don' t want to go to this building .

well , this is a rare occasion .
where is she ?
who ?
caterine .
<i> who' s caterine ? </ i>
the woman who' s spying on me .
where is she ?
i don' t think this is funny .
oh , god , here we go again .
what' s happening ?
he' s just making a joke on me .
are you making fun of your mother ?
no .
why can' t you get along with her ?
so , how' s your poetry job ?
i got fired from it .
oh , couldn' t even hold down a poetry job .
<i> [ man ]
brenda , what the hell did you do ? </ i>
i didn' t touch it .
bullshit !
i have this programmed on my favorite stations on a timer .
can i please have some time with my son ?
i want to show him an article i have here on marketing internship .
you see this ?
that' s great , mom .
it' s right up my alley .
but it is .
it' s a new hot ...
i sent this to you .
why don' t you ever listen to me ...
have you seen this system ?
state of the art .
we got speakers all through the house .
but listen to this . ??
??
it' il be easier to talk now .
where did she come from ?
<i> what' s going on ? </ i>
see , i wasn' t making a joke .
what' s her name ?
i would like to discuss some curious findings .
who is this lady ?
i found here in your apartment ... <i>a rather troubling</ i> <i>piece of evidence . </ i>
<i> [ brenda ]
what evidence ? </ i>
do you recognize the handwriting , mr. markovski ...
excuse me , mr. silver ?
<i> [ albert ]
this is silly .
let' s go . </ i>
no .
<i> i wanna go . </ i>
could you please read the date for me ?
november 17 , 1989 .
albert was nine .
this is his journal .
would you mind reading this out loud ?
no .
please .
<i>this stuff doesn' t matter . </ i>
<i>let' s go . </ i>
<i>oh , my god . </ i>
i came home from school .
mom was in the kitchen with a strange lady .
mom told me to go back to my room .
i thought i was in trouble .
she closed my door and said , ' purree got hit by a car and killed . '
<i>" and then she took me back</ i> <i>to the lady in the kitchen ... </ i>
<i>" and told me to spell words</ i> <i>to show how i' m a good speller . </ i>
<i>" i said i had to go</ i> <i>to the bathroom . </ i>
<i>" i climbed out the window . </ i>
<i>i went down the block . </ i>
<i>" i saw barney playing punch ball . </ i>
<i>he said i look sad . </ i>
i told him what happened to my cat .
he said , ' that' s sad . '
then i cried , but i tried not to show .
some of the kids laughed .
barney said he cried when his dog died .
and the kids stopped laughing .
his cat died .
he was sad .
what' s your point ?
nothing strikes you as odd ?
<i> see ?
it' s nothing .
let' s go . </ i>
these things happen .
<i>oui .
c' est vrai . </ i>
the universe is cruel .
but tell me this , mrs. silver , this lady you gave the coffee to ...
was helen' s sister .
i don' t remember her name .
i met her the once .
was there some painful thing about this stranger ... that required your immediate attention ?
no .
helen wasn' t home , so i offered her sister a cup of coffee .
but you agree that purree meant a great deal to albert ?
you can' t make a federal case out of the cat .
answer the question , please .
i don' t know much about the cat .
i traveled a lot for work .
we' re not talking about this anymore .
it' s embarrassing me .
<i> [ caterine ]
precisely the point . </ i>
<i> [ brenda ]
what ? </ i>
you were embarrassed for feeling sad about the death of your cat .
it' s painful enough to feel sad , but on top of it ... to feel embarrassed for feeling , that is the killer .
how is that my fault ?
i didn' t tell him to be embarrassed .
but you did .
it was more important to have a cup of coffee ... <i>with a perfect stranger</ i> <i>than to talk to albert ... </ i>
<i> about what for a small boy is a large tragedy . </ i>
<i> this is ridiculous . </ i>
<i>he climbed out his window, </ i> <i>a criminal in his own house . </ i>
<i> why ? </ i>
i don' t know .
i think you do .
i don' t .
yes , you do .
oh , stop it !
i think you should go .
no , i will not go .
albert has a place here , a place you have denied .
this is my home .
i can tell him what i want .
<i> yes , your home is a lie . </ i>
what does that mean ?
i gave my life to this selfish bas ...
<i>so he could be</ i> <i>an ornament to you , not a person . </ i>
<i> [ doorbell rings ] </ i>
<i> god , what are you , a bitch ? </ i>
<i>you' re a bitch . </ i>
<i>how many kids do you have , bitch ? </ i>
listen .
listen .
this is your mother .
you asked me to come up here ?
what does the doorman have to do with this ?
he was orphaned by civil war .
you were orphaned by indifference .
this is but one part of your puzzle .
do you see ?
<i> [ machine clicks ] </ i>
<i> ?
<i>oh , now the timer' s</ i> <i>all fucked up .
brenda . ! </ i>
<i>gee , is it that hard ? </ i>
<i>go ahead and do it . </ i>
all i' m gonna do is listen ...

i wanna listen to a radio !
i wanna listen to a radio !
<i>[ elevator dings ] </ i>
<i>thanks .
we' il meet you later</ i> <i>by the rock . </ i>
i' m sorry , man .
i need , like , a minute to figure this out .
<i> she had to get you to see . </ i>
see what ?
you were trained to betray yourself right here .
that' s why you betrayed yourself by going to brad .
<i>why didn' t you figure this out ? </ i>
<i>why didn' t you bring me here ? </ i>
because you lied to us .
you told us that the african guy ... was the ... the doorman at your friend' s building , not at your parents ' building .
you encrypted the truth .
that' s how good you are at betraying yourself .
right .
i told you that he wasn' t ready for infinity .
don' t start with that magic blanket bullshit , okay ?
it' s not magic .
it' s just the way things are .
you and me and the air are actually tiny particles ... that are swirling around together .
look right here .
you see ?
okay .
but look at the cracks ... between these particles and the cracks we fall through , the holes of nothingness .
exactly .
because that' s what i just experienced upstairs .
look closer .
there are tiny particles connecting the larger cubes .
yeah , and then tinier cracks between the connections .
and even tinier connections .
and even tinier cracks .
yeah , but if you look close enough , you can' t tell where my nose ends ... and space begins , because they' re unified .
see ?
so what ?
you can' t see any of this anyway !
do you see anything ?
no .
but i want to debate this particle cube thing .
you live all the time with things you can' t see .
you can' t see electricity , can you ?
you can' t see radio waves , but you accept them .
trust .
fuck trust !
you better stay away from caterine , albert ...
' cause she' s gonna lead you down the path of darkness .
she was our prize graduate student till she went astray .
i think that i am gonna stay with her , the cracks , the pain , the nothingness ... because that' s more real to me , that' s what i feel .
word .
okay .
we' re not sweatin ' it .
no , we' re gonna work with brad .
it' il all come back to you ...
and interconnection .
brad ?
are you kidding me ?
i' m gonna work on that prick , and it' s all gonna come back to pain and no connection !
no .
it' s on .
we' il see .
we' il see .
ooh , damn .
come on .
oh , shit .
fuck .
oh , look at this .
kafka .
<i> he' s planting garbage for us . </ i>

<i> kafka . </ i>

so fishy .
<i> [ voices on headphones ] </ i>

i was hoping for a break like this .

whoa .
whoa .
i' m not unhappy to be with you !
let me see this !
putting on a show .
can' t say no .
inside i' m drowning , sighing and frowning .
that doesn' t sound very happy to me .
does it sound very happy to you ?
i only wrote " frowning " to rhyme with " drowning .
then why did you need " drowning " ?
to rhyme with " frowning .
there ...
there' s nothing in it .
what does that mean ?
look !
and why do they have to go through our yard and go through the garbage ?
<i> what is he doing ?
stop that . </ i>
why is he sniffing my blouse ?
perspiration levels indicate stress , and that' s kind of high .
<i> [ dawn sighs ] </ i>
<i> brad signed a rather comprehensive contract ... </ i> <i>allowing unfettered access</ i> <i>to your home . </ i>
well , it' s my home too , and i didn' t sign anything .

the mortgage is in his name , and you' re not married .

you don' t believe in therapy .
no , see , i don' t see this as therapy .

no , hey .

hey !
hey !
no .
now , unfettered access .

the paragliding ?
a quick look at your label .
it' s just like that .
no , it' s not like that !

no , it is .
everything will end up nice .

they can help me .
help the open spaces .
help huckabees .
<i> what are you talking about ? </ i>
he did mention that in his application ... that he felt exhausted from having to constantly charm everyone ... but doesn' t see any alternative because ...
you need to get people to like you to be successful to get things done in this world .

<i> duh .
brad likes to be charming . </ i>
<i>it comes naturally . </ i>

ms. campbell , how have you felt about being pretty ?
oh , please .
i don' t think of myself as being that pretty .
yes , that' s changed at huckabees , but , you know ...
i was never the pretty girl .
really ?
<i> no . </ i>
i just have to keep up with this gorgeous hottie .

how is the sex ?
the sex ?
come on , guys .

you watched us ?
no , just listened .
<i> [ brad ]
so , your surveillance is wrong . </ i>

it' s quantity , not quality .
what ?
she meant quality , not quantity .
<i> i know .
i was onlyjoking . </ i>
were you joking ...
when you said quantity and not quality ?
in regards to sex ?
we' re not gonna discuss this .
we' re private about ...

eight minutes of heaven !
it' s not quality , it' s quantity !
<i>[ laughing ] </ i>

why is marriage and kids so important ?
there' s an overpopulation problem .
<i> [ bernard ]
whoa . </ i>
that came out of left field .
<i> all right . </ i>
why is having children the ultimate performance for successful people ?
why ?
well , it doesn' t have to be a performance .
you know , we don' t have to have kids .
we could just , you know , think about it , or not .
could just be ourselves , jet skiing , whatever .

it it' s just ...
i ...
i ...
i don' t know .

it' s like i' m a rock or a dish of mold .
i' m whatever else is around .

yes .
<i> do it again .
do it again . </ i>
<i> now . </ i>
careful , my young students ... you cannot stay in this state all day .
<i> why not ? </ i>
yeah , why not ?
it is inevitable that you are drawn back into human drama .
desire , suffering ... everything that exists in this imperfect world .
shit .
so we get drawn back into human drama ... and how important we think that is .
then we do crazy stuff .
we have to go back to the ball ... so we can get the freedom of being like a ... like a dish of mold .
yes .
and then back to the drama , the suffering .
it' s kind of a crappy deal .
<i> c' est exactement ca . </ i>
an absurd theatrical we must play out , back and forth ... from pure being to human suffering .
but isn' t the drama and suffering less if we do the ball thing every day ?
don' t call it " the ball thing .
call it " pure being .
doesn' t the pure being , ball thing make the day to day suffering easier ?
yeah .
no , it doesn' t .
you' re wrong .
we' re gonna do this every day .
we' il show you .
it' il make it easier .
i' il prove it to you .
human drama is inevitable .
suffering cannot be diminished .
you cannot escape , tommy .
you' il see .
existence is a cruel joke ... that entices in a form of desire .
absurd theater of desire .
i know , buddy , it hurts .
it' s painful .

where you goin ' ?
to meditate on desire and suffering .
can i come ?
no .

is that why you' re doing this , to teach me ?
yeah , is that why you' re doing this , to teach him ?
<i> of course it is . </ i>
there are unique moments when two people share the deep sorrow of existence .
all right .
that' s what i wanted to hear .
<i> how can you believe that bullshit ? </ i>
t tom ...
tom , i' m sorry .
<i>this just happened . </ i>
<i>i' ve never done anything like this before . </ i>
<i> we could still be ...
you can</ i> <i>still be my other , right ? </ i>
shut up , albert .
<i>i brought you here .
i wanted to share</ i> la force <i>with you , and you ruined it . </ i>
you fell in love .
<i> [ caterine ]
do not defile it with clich . </ i>
it is unnameable .
yeah ?
well , i reject unnameable !
<i>[ clattering ] </ i>
it leaves me out !
<i>where is your pure being now , tommy ? </ i>
<i>i told you . </ i>
i' m just gonna accept my loneliness .
and i' m gonna go to an even darker place of nothingness .
from an even farther , more extreme nothingness on my own !
who needs you guys ?
<i> [ caterine ]
ahh , sublime . </ i>
<i>hey , welcome . </ i>
<i>you like my new office ? </ i>
let' s start with the method .

okay .
what are you doing ?
okay .
what are you doing ?
what are you doing ?
i' m jokin ' around , guys .
but seriously , i want to quit the process with you .
nothing personal .
i appreciate what you' ve done for me , but i' m over it .

paragraph 201 .
neither client nor detective ...
may terminate case prior to resolution as defined by paragraph 314 , subclause ' d ' ...
which states ...
that' s not binding .
oh , it' s binding .
i' il find a lawyer .
<i> oh ? </ i>
or maybe even go to the fbl .
how about that ?
<i> go ahead . </ i>
oh , i will .
i' m not kidding .
no , brad , this is how it works .
you go to the police .
you ...
you tell them that you went to the existential detectives .
<i>they ask why . </ i>
<i>you say , " for personal reasons . " </ i>
or , maybe you wanted to work the politics at your corporation ...
by rattling albert markovski .
i never told you that .
well , give us a little credit .
the police go to huckabees .
they talk to them .
the board learns that rising star , brad stand ... has weird existential issues .
<i> or he fakes them . </ i>
which is odd .
which is worse .
and your girlfriend , the voice of huckabees ...
is dressing like an amish bag lady .
okay , i get it .
you know , brad , suddenly your star isn' t rising anymore .
it' s sinking .
okay .
i said i get it , bernie .
relax .
<i> passive aggressive . </ i>
shut up .
aggressive aggressive .
does dawn want to quit ?
<i> dawn' s into this crap for real ... </ i> which is the stupidest thing i' ve ever seen in my life .
<i>shall we get back</ i> <i>to the case ? </ i>

<i>[ crying ] </ i>
ooh .
mm hmm .

he talks about geckos all the time .
what' s the point ?
i thought he was a sweet , sensitive young man .
oh , excuse me .
you ...
you spoke to my fat , sad brother ?
<i> yes , brad , on the phone . </ i>
indeed , i did , at length .
well , if he' s so sensitive , why doesn' t he lose 70 pounds and stop talking about geckos .
maybe he' il find some friends .
<i> well , your brother feels</ i> <i>that you' re ashamed ofhim . </ i>
are you sympathetic to him ?
are you kidding me ?
i gave him a car .
<i> [ bernard ]
mm hmm . </ i>
i send him shirts .
<i> mm hmm . </ i>
i ...
look .
here , guys .
geckos .
and i keep ' em .
i' m a pretty good older brother .
<i>[ vivian ]
he wishes you would</ i> <i>listen to him more . </ i>
about what , geckos ?
i ...
i don' t have all the answers .
but maybe he should listen to me more and learn a little .
<i>[ vivian ]
you have several stories that</ i> <i>you like to tell over and over and over . </ i>

i' m a vegetarian , brad .

you hurt my feelings .

but you had to do it anyway , didn' t ya ?
she' s a very powerful person .
and i haven' t been with a lot of women .
obviously .
and she used me to teach <i>us</ i> about the inevitability of human drama .
so ?
is that where you get off the ride ?
hell no .
i didn' t think so .
looks like you saw some truth .
looks like you saw some truth .
what' d you see ?
well , the interconnection thing is definitely for real .
it is !
i didn' t think it was .
i can' t believe it .
it' s so fantastic !
that' s amazing .
i know .
but it' s also nothing special .
yeah , because it grows from the manure of human trouble .
you see , the detectives , they just wanted to gloss right over that .
but in fact , no manure , no magic .
did you hear some of that ?
some of it sounds pretty good .
i think ...
i think this case is closed .
is it ever really closed ?
hmm .
what are you doing tomorrow ?
i was thinking about chaining myself to a bulldozer .
do you want to come ?
what time ?
mm , 1 : 00 , 1 : 30 .
sounds good .
should i bring my own chains ?
we always do .
