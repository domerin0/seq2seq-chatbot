hard copy , why don' t you move your fuckin ' crew outta the way ?

it' s the globe theatre .
it' s the old vic .

they' re watching king lear .

was that as easy a fight as it looked ?
of course it was easy .
i' m the greatest fighter in the world .
even in china .
nobody can beat me .
you know , you got a little attitude there .
are you mad at something ?
i' m a little upset with myself , because i had a image of this guy falling on a right hand .
but i hit him with the left , and i hit him so hard that his jaw kind of shattered .
when i came back with the right . he was already on the ground .
glory be to god !
all praises due allah !
god bless america .
this is a great champion and a great man .
if i can have the fighter back a minute here , reverend .
you' re saying it makes a difference to you how he falls ?
with a left or a right ?
oh , definitely .
i' m a artist out there , and and , you know ... it' s like i painted a beautiful picture of the mona lisa and forgot to put the breast on .
that' s beccause the champ is an artist , and he' s the greatest showman on the planet .
and the greatest fighter .
no man can beat this man at this point in his life .
and i want you to know , marvin shabazz , wherever you are ... you better watch the things you' re sayin ' , ' cause we hear ' em .
reverend
to go along with the rest of the heads he already has .
let me borrow the fighter
we' re callin ' the taxidermist right now for the fighter that he just laid out .
let me get the fighter back .
did this guy hurt you at all ?
not at all .
he hit me one time just to wake me up , because i was bored .
bored ?
that' s right .
otherwise , it was just like fightin ' my little sister .
that' s right .
otherwise , it was just like fightin ' my little sister .

fire the employees .
file chapter 11 .

you bet your yarmulke .

fred , please , now .
you' re just a little upset .

peter , do you know what' s wrong ?
no .
artemus ?
no .
sol ?
no .
how about you , champ ?
i don' t know nothin ' anymore .
there' s a reason everyone has lost interest ... in the heavyweight championship of the world .
and it' s very simple .
people are tired of payin ' good money ... to watch niggers beat up niggers .
i need a white heavyweight contender worse than white america needs one .
come on .
a white heavyweight ?
man , the two words don' t even go together ..
it' s like sayin ' " black unity .
hey , look , man , cut the bullshit .
i want shabazz .
shut up , boy !
you work for me !
and if you do shut up , and you do work for me ... you' il make more money than you' ve ever dreamed of .
you' il make $40 million .
whoo !
if i' m makin ' 40 , think how much you gonna make .
i am !
hey , look , rev ... nobody gonna buy the idea of a white contender .
it ain' t about race it' s about boxing .
sit down .
i just stood up .
sit down .
what' s the highest grossing fight in the history of boxing ?
uh , tyson gibbons .
ali frazier .
hagler leonard .
no , hagler hearns .
" thrilla " in manila .
no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no !
the highest grossing fight in the history of boxing
is cooney versus holmes .
can you tell me why , james ?
yeah .
' cause cooney was a white boy .
and his jab couldn' t break wind !
that' s true .
if there ain' t a white guy out there for you ...
i' m gonna create you one .
fred sultan ... you and i are gonna take a close look at this boxing promoter ...
this exploiter , embezzler ... charlatan and demagogue .
and by the time our journey is over , gentle viewer ...
i' m gonna expose him for what he really is : the devil incarnate .
the real story begins in 1953 , in atlanta ... when a young man by the name of fred johnson ... who had been a child evangelist ... and who' d already been caught running a pyramid scam on his parishioners ...
was arrested and convicted for assault .
he nearly stomped a man to death very brutally
don' t what army is this ?
all right , all right .
enough .
enough .
not again .
not again .
get this on camera .
don' t touch him again !
yes .
rolling .
i' ve got here marvin shabazz ... the man next in line to fight james roper .
that' s how it should be , but i got a bad feeling about this one , mitchell .
yeah , and if sultan doesn' t give us a shot at the title ... and he tries to duck us , then we will sue him .
that' s right .
that' s right .
and i will support these men .
honorable i i i' il take it , baby .
i' il take it .
these are honorable men .
very yes .
no , we are honorable men .
but i' ve worked too hard for this .
we' ve worked too hard for this .
now , i am the number one contender .
i' m tired of james " the poodle , " " grim reaper , " whatever he want to calls himself ... duckin ' me , all right ?
i' m tired of the man drivin ' around in eight rolls royces .
he ain' t fought nobody .
i' m still in a " brough ham .
exactly .
that a what ?
uh , a a brougham .
he he drives a brougham .
what' s a brougham ?
it' s maroon .
well , actually it' s not maroon .
what it is it' s merlot .
and it' s a brougham .
cut .
did we cut ?
yeah .
what' s a merlot brougham ?
it' s like an old car , right ?

you grow up in the hood .
you become a man .
you wanna start actin ' like a man , then you be a man ,
just like my father had told me that ... when the green grass starts growin ' on the other side , then somebody gotta cut the lawn .
you know , my father said once , " when you when you , uh ...
laugh and the whole world laughs with you .
cry , and i' il give you something to cry about , you little bastard .
that what he said .
and you know what that' s done to me ?
i i' m not  i' m not for sure

julo escobar' s a whore on your payroll .

some said this upcoming title fight is built around racism .
but is it racism that electrifies people ... across the globe ?
or is it a pride in your tribe ?
dimly remembered throb of drums in the night ... or the hard , white hoarfrost of an early morn ... against the gleaming , sinuous muscle of the jungle night .
you can' t do this to me !
i' ve been the sultan' s publicist for 20 years !

james roper' s encephalogram shows ... no cortical lesions whatsoever .
and mr. conklin' s also shows no , uh , no significant braindamage .

wheelchair .

he says he says um ...
if you become champ , terry , i' il believe anything is possible .
even walking again .
love , joey .
terry , you' ve made a change .
man .
i' il tell you , in the cynical age that we live in ... it' s , uh it' s rare indeed ... when someone or something ... becomes so transcendent as terry and this fight have become .
kane !
kane .
what' s the matter ?
what are you doing ?
what are you hiding for ?
enjoying your job ?
don' t , uh
uh , i' m so
i don' t know how to tell you this , but you , um you smell .
you stink a little bit .
well , they took away my suite , after 20 years , like that .
hmm , well  you gotta protect yourself
uh huh .
you know , i' m not  listen .
please .
listen .
the sultan ... is ripe for a fall .
do you understand ?
evereybody in the organization is fed up with him .
it' s not just me .
we' ve been waiting for a new leader to emerge , and it' s you .
i see .
so i' m the , uh
you take over his organization , and you get me my job back .
uh
god sent you ,
are you okay ?
where you goin ' ?
going to take a spronge bath .
okay .
take it take it easy .
i will .
hey , siegfried !
who' s that behind who ?
come on , fellows .
that isn' t funny .
i' m not irish .
i' m not irish .
you' ve got a lovely chest .
lovely .
lovely .
you' re a fucking stallion !
terry conklin !
terry conklin !
stay down , boy !
told you to stay down !
how do you like las vegas , terry ?
what' s that ?
how does it compare to cleveland ?
cleveland' s a real city with real people ... who aren' t concerned with bourgeois attitudes ... concerned with sexism , racism , religiousism ... or any of the other kind of " isms " that vegas is about .
las vegas is one of the most exploitive places i' ve ever seen in my life ... particularly exploitive towards women .
i' ve never been to a city more exploitive towards women .
it makes me sick , and i can' t wait to go home .
but wasn' t that you on the cover of playboy magazine ?
what' s that ?
that was me on the cover of playboy magazine , but let me say two things .
one , i hated it ; and two , that' s not what i' m about .
so how' s the champ lookin ' ?
he' s looking good .
did you see him out there ?
no .
we can' t get in to see him .
it was a great workout .
you should' ve seen the last workout today .
he' s looking excellent .
so what about all these reports of all this roomservice ?
uh , 10 gallons of icecream ... uh , a carton of gummi bears , all the porkskins in vegas ,
the champ has an entourage .
he feeds ' em .
so he' s not eating any of this stuff ?
look .
even if the champ were not in perfect condition ... he' s still a professional fighter ..
he' s got savvy .
he knows how to breathe in a ring .
is racism driving this fight ?
i don' t think so .
two dollars on " irsish " terry .
are we exploiting a history of divisive racial struggle in this country ?
i don' t think so .
two bucks on the clean cut white boy , please .
thank you ,
to play the piano , you need the black keys  and the white keys .
doing a rock opera about the homeless situation in cleveland .
i think it' s applicable universally ... to the homelessness situation in any major american market .
for example , south dakota there' s a homelessness situation that' s been brought to my attention .
conklin' s been getting a lot of publicity ... about his donantions to the homeless .
for your acts of charity .
ain' t nobody' s business what i do with my money .
we' ve found that you' ve given large donations of money to a number of places  alds organizations , multiple sclerosis .
you visit children' s hospitals in every town you go into .
i' m about to donate some money to the remove my foot from your ass foundation .
i told you i don' t wanna talk about this .
this is over .
so you' re quite a rock ' n ' roller ..
i still am quite a rock ' n ' roller .
thanks for mentioning that .
without further objections , i would like to sing my song ... that i' ve just been working on to mr. roper .
would that be all right ?
yeah .
let' s hear it .
it' s called " mr. roper , mr. roper .
i' m gonna open a case of butt whippin '
butt whippin ' butt whippin ' , butt whippin ' butt whippin '
butt whippin '
butt whippin '

mr. roper .
he looks good .
he looks good .
yeah .
looks is what counts , isn' t it ?

wins ?
oh , man , yeah .
if he wins , uh , what are your plans after that ?
have you thought about that ?
like , are you happy with your deal with sultan ?
happy ?
i' d sooner be turked by a syphillitic bear .
tu turk hmm , that' s interesting .
turked " ?
what is " turked " ?
rectally relieved .
oh , geez .
so , what , after after this fight , you' d consider signing him with another promoter ?
or a , uh , smart younger man such as yourself ?

hey , baby , you feeling all right ?
oh , baby , listen .
i' m , uh i' m concerned that the , uh , champ ... is maybe too far gone to beat this conklin kid .
no fucking way the champ loses this fight .

you' re starting to believe your own bullshit .
relax .
the fight' s a lock .
you would know .
you' re the paisley pooh bah .

the champ and i have our little disagreements .

what' s that ?
i love you ,
very clever .
i gotta get one of those .
you' re my brother .
from the brother of brothers .
oh , god .

the fervor charts go off the wall when the challenger is when the challenger' s
white .
there , i' ve said it , doc .
white .
i' m glad you said it , stu .
om .
roper is a jungle animal .
he wants to do unspeakable things to your mother and your sister .
johnny , you do not have to whip me into a racist frenzy to beat this man .
we all know you' re a racist bastard .
me , a racist ?
you' re a pig .
i am not a racist .
i' m a bloody englishman , the fairest people on the planet , mate .

conklin !

is that a circus entrance ?
is it a fighter coming in or a clown ?
the guy thinks this is a rock concert .
maybe we' re in the wrong place .
maybe this is a rock concert .
terry !
yeah !
all right !
none of the experts give this kid a chance .
yet , can a hundred million fans across america be wrong ?
if conklin had started earlier in his career , would he be the champion ?
or if roper had fought somebody as good as conklin , would he be the champion today ?
yeah !
yeah !
yeah !
conklin !
conklin !
conklin !
yeah ! it' s obvious that the champion is delaying his entrance into the arena .
i' m just thinking , is he trying psychologically ... to toy with the mind of the challenger ?

you' re gonna have to take me !

he could get tired .
stu , do you think there could be anything wrong ?
i' il tell you what it is , johnny .
the boy is scared of me .

and as roper finally enters the ring
it' s hard to imagine how a popular champion ... could become so unpopular in such a short period of time .
yeah , that' s a story , but the other story is there 20 pounds this guy' s carrying .
how can he come in look at the belly hanging over his trunks .
that' s a disgrace .
the guy never met a meal he didn' t like .
