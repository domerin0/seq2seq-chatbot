come on .
let' s put your stuff in the guestroom .
so jessica tells us you two met at the magazine .
are you in the art department ?
i' m an associate editor .
sounds impressive .
it' s just a glorified fact checker .
tim' s very good at his job .
how about family ?

any brothers , sisters ?
no , sir .
no brothers or sisters , just me .
how about your folks ?
let the boy eat .
we' re just talking , mother .
dad .
the family thing' s kind of complicated , sir .
this stuffing is delicious , chelsea .
tim' s had kind of a strained relationship with his parents .
tim' s father ran out when he was 8 .
jess .
oh , that' s sad .
then he had to go live with his uncle , in a tiny room in the back of his bar .
well , what about your mother ?
she sort of had a tough time after my dad left .
it was pretty hard on both of us .
is there anything else you wanted to know , dad ?
be down in a minute , mom .
you have fun down there ?
oh , come on .
they could use a little shaking up .
you see my sister' s face when i said ... ... you lived in a tiny room in the back of a bar ?
it wasn' t in the back of a bar , you know .
i know .
i just like messing with them .
is that why you wanted me here , to freak out your family ?
no .
no .
hey , i' m sorry , okay ?
tell you what ... ... i gotta go down , say good night ... ... but i' il sneak in later and make it up to you .
okay ?
in that case ... ... l' il put on something naughty .
you do that .
i like this sneaking around thing .
it' s kind of dirty .
you all right ?
timmy .
you can' t keep running away .
look at me .
mom ?
why , what' s the matter with you ?
look at me !
look at me .
look at me .
you' re a bad little boy .
tim ?

tim , what is it ?
jessica .
oh , god , i had the most messed up dream .
what was it ?
i gotta go see my mom .

that' s fantastic .
that' s really strong .
what' s that you' ve got , peter ?
oh , that rainbow is beautiful .
how many colors in there ?
i' m thinking of going by the old house .
really ?
my uncle' s been fixing the place up ... ... to sell since mom went to the hospital last year .
i felt like i should be the one to go through her things .
i should' ve done more , but it' s something , right ?
listen to me , tim .
something happened in that house ... ... but it wasn' t supernatural .
there' s nothing in there but memories .
you dealt with your father' s leaving the best way that you could .
but you were 8 .
tim , you' ve been coming here for what , 15 years ?
look around you .
there' s only children here .
dr. matheson to observation .
i' m sorry .
i have to go .
go home , tim .
spend one night in that house .
it will help .
it' s okay .
it' s okay .
hey , we need some help in here !
hey , the nurse is on the way .
it' s okay , it' s all right .
what ?
what is it ?
just relax now .
it' s gonna be all right .
it' s all right .
everything' s gonna be all right .
we shall not all fall asleep ... ... but we will all be changed ... ... in an instant , in the blink of an eye .
when my tongue rejoices , my body will rest in peace ... ... because you will not abandon me to the grave .
for you , o lord , have delivered my soul to death ... ... my eyes from tears , my feet from stumbling .
thou knowest the secrets ....
.... spare us .
suffer us not in our last hour .
dust thou art ... ... and unto dust thou shalt return .
thanks for doing all this .
she was my sister .
when are you heading back ?
actually , i might stay in town tonight .
in the house .
i thought you didn' t like that house .
yeah , well .
tim , the place is a mess .
i' ve been doing a whole lot of work there
i won' t mess anything up .
is that katie ?
yeah .
how long has it been ?
a long time .
you should go and say hi .
no , i don' t think so .

you might need these .
thanks for everything .
it' s good seeing you again , tim .

come on , timmy , just turn the light on .
i' m not coming up there .
he' s scared of his damn closet .
you know why he' s so scared , don' t you ?
why ?
because you freaked him out ... ... with that stupid story of yours .
you' ve gotta be kidding .
it was a story .
my dad did the same thing to me .
look how you turned out .
it was nothing , okay ?
he' s got a very vivid imagination .

no .
no , i don' t .
you know what i mean .

so how long are you staying around ?
i think just tonight .
i wanted to go through my mom' s things , you know , pictures and stuff .
i found a goofy one of you and me .
goofy ?
