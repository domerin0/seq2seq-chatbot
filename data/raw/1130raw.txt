david beckham gets the ball yet again for manchester united .
he' s really taking responsibility every time they have possession .
this reflects the way he' s been captaining england .
he' s dominating proceedings , hoping perhaps to get a bit more support as he gathers the ball on this right hand touchline time after time .
and the old trafford crowd warming to the way beckham is taking over , but the question is , where is the goal going to come from to break down anderlecht ?
will it be scholes ?
could it be ryan giggs ?
would it be beckham himself ?
because anderlecht are playing a very controlled game .
this is radzinski , testing the united defence , and sylvestre possibly with a chance to break forward on the other flank .
and there' s the ball that beckham really wants .
that looked like a body check , but he shrugged off the defender .
it' s a decent cross , and there is bhamra .
it' s a fine header , and she' s scored !
it' s a goal by jess bhamra !
a superb header , beating the defender , and planting the ball beyond the goalkeeper' s left hand .
jess bhamra makes a name for herself at old trafford !
and have we discovered a new star here , gary lineker ?
that' s right .
could bhamra be the answer to england' s prayers ?
alan ?
quick thinking , comfortable on the ball , vision and awareness magnificent .
i wish she was playing for scotland !
john , have england found the player to relive their ' 66 world cup glory ?
definitely , and the best thing is , she' s not even reached her peak yet .
we' re joined now by jess' s mother .
you must be proud of your daughter .
not at all !
she shouldn' t be showing her bare legs to 70, 000 people !
she' s bringing shame on the family .
don' t encourage her !
jesminder , you get back home now !
are you listening to me ?
have you gone mad ?
football , shootball !
your sister' s getting engaged , and you' re watching this skinhead boy !
it' s beckham' s corner !
come downstairs .
your sister' s going crazy .
i' ve got to go !
mum , where are my keys ?
i' m sick of this wedding and it hasn' t even started !
that girl is a first class bitch !
pinky , you' ve got so many others !
i need another one !
get a move on !
what the hell' s going on ?
teet' s bloody sister says she' s wearing baby pink now .
stupid cow !
i had matching accessories and everything !
mum , do i have to go shopping again ?
my mother chose all my 21 dowry suits herself .
i never complained .
you are spoilt !
don' t forget my dhania .
and more carrots .
i' m making achar .
oh , mum , don' t do pickle as well !
am i asking you to make it ? !
hi , pinks !
are you all right ?
you haven' t left everything to the last minute , have you ?
yeah .
one more day of freedom !
where did you get your contacts ?
like ' em ?
they go with my hair .
my fiance don' t like dyed hair .
can' t stand here all day .
i got to go to ealing for my facial .
laters !
bye , pinks .
laters .
stupid bitch !
why did she get blue contacts ?
now i can' t wear mine !
i' d never wear that !
they' re all the rage , poppet !
you blow ' em up , just like a lilo .
look , this little pump comes free with it .
pop it in the valve , pump away , up it goes , then slip it back in there ... .. and boom !
cleavage !
they' re perfect while you' re still growing
' cause they lift you right there .
mum !
god , you' re so embarrassing !
they make more of what you' ve got .
all the girls have bought one for their daughters .
the fleur' s pretty , and the gel bra' s a clever one no pumping , it' s already in there .
not the sports bras !
they' re so plain !
they don' t enhance .
no one' s going to see them .
it' s not how they look , it' s how they make you feel .
i really like that lace lycra one .
uh oh , there' s your mate .
i hope his mum wears a cardi over her three stomachs tomorrow !
shut up !
she' s old .
so ?
all right , jess ?
hiya , pinky .
may you have a long life , my daughters !
getting ready for tomorrow ?
yes , massiji .
mum' s making samosas .
may god keep you and your husband in endless happiness !
and pray for me that i get a lovely daughter in law like you for my tony .
aw , thank you , massiji !
ok , bye !
how was biology ?
did you do the genetics one ?
yes , she passed the gene to her son .
i got that , too .

go on !
chest it !
did that hurt , pretty boy ?
i nearly scored from 25 yards today .
bent it and everything .
i could have played all night .
it' s not fair that boys never have to come home and help .
if i had an arranged marriage , would he let me play football ?
who are you talking to ?
no one , dad .
ok , biji and her grandson are staying in here for the wedding .
why don' t you put a nice picture of beautiful sceneries
instead of this bald man ?
dad !
i' m going to change .
come and help me out , ok ?
.. a beautiful rolls royce , you know ?
i' il get one for your wedding , too , if you like .
it will be your turn soon , eh ?
do you want a clean shaven boy like your sister or a proper sikh with a full beard and a turban ?
it' s only our men that have a big engine and full mot , eh ?
nah , man , the alternator' s gone on the merc !
just do the nissan .
i told you not to bother me !
it' s my engagement , man !
switch it off .
he is so tick , man !
innit , innit ?
i know !
he' s taking his shirt off !
a body like that needs an x certificate warning !
and a lifetime guarantee !
yeah , man !
call jess !
jess !
who' s that with the gorgeous bod ?
the one with the six pack .
if he looks at me , i' il faint !
what ?
taz ?
is that his name ?
look at that kick !
he is so fly !
that is fine .
that is so fine !
get your girlfriend !
jess !
go on .
lover boy' s calling you !
you know he' s just my mate .
we' re not all slags like you lot !
bitch !
just ' cause she' s still a v , she thinks she' s better than us !
at least she hasn' t got off with half of hounslow like you two !
who' s that gori watching her ?
come on , jess !
it' s all yours !
that was brilliant !
do you play for any side ?
yeah , like whose ?
southall united sari squad ?
i play for hounslow harriers girls .
you should come and have a trial .
a trial ?
think i' m good enough ?
yeah .
you' re really good .
it' s up to our coach , but we could do with some new blood .
that' s brilliant !
do you swap shirts at the end ?
and have a bath together ?
where' s the soap ?
yeah , it does , doesn' t it ?
let' s play football .
i' m jules .
jess .
yes !
i want two groups of three .
let' s move !
how do you know she' s serious .
she' s got balls .
at least watch her .
hi .
where do you normally play ?
in the park .
i mean what position ?
sorry !
i usually play all over , but up front on the right is best .
get your boots on .
i haven' t got any .
right , join in .
start warming up .
where shall i put this ?
put it over here .
jesus !
pass it to jules !
brilliant !
how did it feel out there ?
really great !
i' ve never seen an indian girl into football .
i didn' t know about the girls ' team .
it' s her fault .
when i played for the men' s club , she whined that there was no team for her to play on .
i wasn' t whining !
there was nothing for us girls .
there was junior boys stuff , but when he busted his knee , he set up a girls ' side , and he' s been on my case ever since !
they made me start at the bottom .
you can' t get much lower than her !
you' re so full of it !
nah , we get just as many trophies as the men' s side do .
so , does she pass ?
are your folks up for it ?
yeah , they' re cool .
suppose you' d better come back , then .
i' ve got to go and open the bar .
some real work !
he likes you .
you think so ?
he asked you back , didn' t he ?
how long have you been playing ?
for ages , but just in the park .
nothing as serious as this .
this , serious ?
it' il do for now .
i want to play professionally .
wow !
can you do that ?
not really here , but you can in america .
they' ve got a pro league with new stadiums and everything .
really ?
i can' t believe it !
it' s a proper pitch with lights , corner flags , changing rooms ...
the coach likes me .
he really knows his stuff .
must be gutted he can' t play with his injury and all .
jules is so lucky !
her mum and dad must really support her to let her go all the way to america to play .
i don' t even know how to tell my mum and dad about hounslow harriers .
oops !
oh , will you both pack it in !
look at the state of my fuchsias !
when are you gonna realise you have a daughter with breasts , not a son ?
paula !
no boy' s gonna go out with a girl
who' s got bigger muscles than him !
leave her alone .
i' m not gonna give it up !
i saw kevin with a blonde girl and they weren' t talking about match of the bleedin ' day !
he can shag whoever he bloody wants !
honey , all i' m saying is there is a reason why sporty spice is the only one of them without a fella .
sweetheart ...
why don' t you get off her flamin ' back ?
if she' d rather play football than chase boys , i' m over the moon about that .
they' re a bit tatty , but they' il do .
here' s a kit .
you can get it dirty .
can' t i wear my tracksuit bottoms ?
no .
shit !
jess , get changed over here .
you' ve met our captain , mel .
yeah , nice to meet you .
ready for a proper match ?
chiswick next .
best defensive record in the division .
they' re due for a good stuffing .
absolutely !
we need some pace up front .
jules could do with some decent service !
welcome to the harriers .
painters and decorators are in .
jules , take over the warm up .
come on , girls , keep going !
heads up !
jess , what' s going on ?
it looks awful .
it' s why i can' t wear shorts ever .
jesus !
that' s a stunner !
i thought i had a bad one on my knee but yours is gorgeous .
look , don' t worry about it .
no one' s gonna care once you' re out there .
what happened ?
you don' t want to know .
look ...
two operations later and it' s still useless .
does yours affect your game ?
nah , it just looks awful .
i was eight .
my mum was working overtime at heathrow and i was trying to cook beans on toast .
when i jumped up to the grill to get the toast , my trousers caught alight , so my sister put me in the bath , poured cold water over me and pulled them off but half my skin came off , too .
sorry .
i know .
put me off beans on toast for life .
come on .
mine stopped me from playing outright , yours doesn' t .
no more dawdling .
sorry about your knee .
yeah , yeah .
i' m a right sob story , aren' t i ?
come on !
i want to see some sweat on you !
well , she' s all you' d ever want she' s the kind they' d like to flaunt and take to dinner
and she always knows her place she' s got style , she' s got grace she' s a winner
she' s a lady !
oh , whoa , whoa , whoa she' s a lady i' m talking about my little lady oh , whoa , whoa , she' s a lady !
lady !
well , she' s a lady !
hey , tony !
are you here for fantasy football ?
you look like a pro !
it' s brilliant .
they' re a top team
and the coach is ace .
excellent !
what' s that ?
haven' t you seen a burn before ?
that' s disgusting , man !
back off , you wanker !
no , it' s fine .
at least i can still skin you alive !
the skill , the skill !
the skill !
that' s not fair !
he touched you all over !
put his hands on your bare legs !
you' re not a young girl any more !
and showing the world your scar !
jessie , now that your sister' s engaged , it' s different .
you know how people talk .
she' s getting married , not me !
i was married at your age !
you won' t even learn to cook dhal !
i' m not playing with boys any more .
good !
end of matter !
i' m in a girls ' team , playing proper matches .
the coach said i could go far .
go far ?
go far to where ?
we let you play all you wanted when you were young , huh ?
you' ve played enough .
that' s not fair !
he selected me !
he ? !
she said it was girls !
the coach , joe .
see how she lies ?
i don' t want you running around half naked in front of men , huh ?
look how dark you' ve become , playing in the sun !
but i' m really good !
who will want a daughter in law who can kick a football all day but can' t make round chapattis ?
now exams are over , you' il learn full punjabi dinner , meat and vegetarian !
but , dad !
no !
this is where you spoil her !
this is how it started with your niece , and she ran off to become a model wearing small , small skirts !
she' s a fashion designer !
she' s divorced !
cast off after three years of being married to a white boy with blue hair !
her poor mother hasn' t been able to set foot in that temple since .
i don' t want the shame on my family .
that' s it !
no more football !
jessie , your mother is right .
it' s not nice .
you must start behaving like a proper woman .
ok ?
anything i want is just not indian enough for ' em !
i never bunked off school .
i don' t wear make up or tight clothes .
they don' t see that !
parents never see the good things .
anyone can cook aloo gobi ,
but who can bend a ball like beckham ?
just play and don' t tell them .
pinky' s been sneaking off for years to see teets .
what your parents don' t know won' t hurt .
why should i have to lie ?
it' s not like i' m sleeping around with anyone !
jess !
hello !
i thought you' d be here .
this is tony .
this is jules from the team .
jess is well made up with your team .
we' ve got high hopes for her , especially me .
my mum doesn' t want me to play any more .
that' s bollocks !
my mum' s never wanted me to play .
you can' t take no for an answer .
yeah , but my sister' s getting married so mum and dad are stressed out .
i won' t be able to get to training and matches .
come on , jess .
you can' t leave me alone out there .
joe has an american scout coming over .
don' t worry about your mum .
just say you got a summer job .
i could put in a good word for you at hmv with me .
so ... .. now we' ve got that sorted , show me what your fella can do !
he' s not my boyfriend !
i' m not her boyfriend !
jess , come on !
are you playing ?
jessie !
breakfast !
nah , i' m in a hurry !
you can' t go to work on an empty stomach .
where' s my keys ?
jessie !
no , i' m late , mum .
bye !
hush now , child

indian girls don' t play football !
it' s not just an indian thing .
how many people support us ?
are you promised to someone ?
nah .
my sister' s getting married .
it' s a love match .
what' s that mean ?
it' s not arranged .
so , could you choose a white boy ?
white , no , black , definitely not , a muslim , eh eh !
you' il marry an indian , then !
probably .
how can you stand it ?
it' s just culture .
why sleep with boys you aren' t going to marry ?
that' s the best bit !
yeah , you should know !
are you ready to go ?
see you slags later !
it' s only me .
mum , i' m starving .
i worked through my lunch hour today .
where' s pinky ?
she was supposed to pick you up so you wouldn' t be late for poli .
pinky , why didn' t you pick your sister up from work , huh ?
i went but the manager said i' d just missed her .
ok , poli' s on her way .
i' il make you girls some tea .

ssh !
i' ve been playing football for a women' s team .

what is wrong with you , jess ?
at least lie for something good !
don' t you want a boyfriend like everyone else ?
you' re quite pretty .
do your hair , some make up , you' d look all right .

mum , why do i have to wear a sari ?

the waist , 27 .
i need to buy different shoes to go with the sari and the suits .
come again ?
she' s coming into line now !

you need one black and one white to go with everything .
i know i make mistakes i will have to live and learn

i didn' t want you to think i' m not as strong as the others .
that' s stupid , jess .
look , my dad was my coach .
scouts told him that i was too slight to play , so he kept pushing me .
that' s how i screwed my knee .
your dad made you ?
i wanted to show him i wasn' t soft , so i tried to play injured .
he was a bastard anyway .
you shouldn' t say that about your dad .
you don' t know my dad .

oh , that' s nice .
jesmin dah .
lovely !
well , jesmin dah , i bet your room at home doesn' t look like this !
big butch women on the wall !
thanks , mum , i' m not old like you !
jess , i hope you can teach my daughter a bit about your culture , including respect for elders and the like , eh ?
cheeky madam !
well , jess ...
i expect your parents are fixing you up with a handsome young doctor soon .
pretty girl like you ...
mum !
stop embarrassing yourself !
what ?
just being friendly !
you don' t mind , do you , love ?
now , are you a friend from school or work ?
she' s a footballer .
she' s on the team with me .
jesmin dah " !
did you see her face , though ? !
juliet !
jesmin dah !
what was that ?
are you all right ?
oh , jesus !
jules ...
you know joe , do you like him ?
nah , he' d get sacked if he was caught shagging one of his players .
really ?
i wish i could find a bloke like him .
everyone i know' s a prat .
they think girls can' t play as well as them , except joe , of course .
yeah , i hope i marry an indian boy like him , too .
what ?
i' m sorry !
shut up !
we' re not trying to cause trouble .
we felt it our duty to tell you .
you know how hard it is for our children here .
sometimes they misjudge and start behaving like the kids here .
all i know is that children are a map of their parents .
you stupid flippin ' cow !
you' ve ruined your sister' s life !
happy now ?
the wedding' s off ' cause of you !
me ?
why ?
they saw you being filthy with an english boy !
i wasn' t with any english boy !
you were at a bus stop kissing him !
why didn' t you do it in secret like everyone else ?
kissing ?
me ?
a boy ? !
you' re all bloody mad !
jesminder , don' t swear !
i was at the 120 bus stop today but with juliet .
my friend .
she' s a girl , and we weren' t kissing or anything for god' s sake !
swear by babaji .
i swear on babaji' s name .
sometimes these english girls have such short hair ...
you just can' t tell .
they must have made a mistake .
his parents are just making an excuse .
we were never good enough for them .
no , i bet she was with some dykey girl from her football team !
she' s still playing !
she ain' t got no job !
she' s been lying !
why have i two deceiving daughters ?
what did i do wrong in my past life ?
but she' s ruined my life !
i knew you were sneaking out with that good for nothing teetu as well !
well , just talk to them , innit ?
i' il come and talk to your parents .
jules , come here to me .
where' s your mate ?
i don' t know .
this is the second training session in a row she' s missed .
it' s not like her .
did she say she was unhappy with anything ?
her parents didn' t know she was on the team .
maybe they found out .
what ?
she said her folks were up for it .
i' ve told her to tell them but she won' t listen to me .
i' il get it !
yeah ?
hello .
thanks , jess .
i' m sorry to barge in on you like this , but i wanted to talk to you in person .
i found out today that you didn' t know jess was playing for us .
no , we didn' t .
i apologise .
if i' d known , i would have encouraged jess to tell you because she' s got tremendous potential .
we know better our daughter' s potential .
jess has no time for games .
she' il start university soon .
but playing for the team is an honour !
what bigger honour is there than respecting your elders ?
young man , when i was a teenager in nairobi ,
i was the best fast bowler in our school .
our team even won the east african cup .
but when i came to this country , nothing .
i was not allowed to play in any team , and the bloody goras in their clubhouses made fun of my turban and sent me off packing !
i' m sorry , mr bhamra ... .. but now it' s ...
now what ?
our boys aren' t in the football leagues .
you think they will let our girls ?
i don' t want you to build up jesminder' s hopes .
she will only end up disappointed like me .
it' s changing now .
nasser hussein is captain of the english cricket team
and he' s asian .
muslim families are different .
oh , mum !
we' ve been invited to play in germany this saturday .
it' s a shame you' il miss it .
wow !

i wish i could right now wish that i could show you how ...
that was so brilliant the way you came to my house .
you were brave enough to face my mum !
your dad can' t be as mad as her !
your mam' s a barrel of laughs compared to me dad !
i don' t need to feel close to my family , jess .
i don' t need you to feel sorry for me .
you bitch !
shit !
jules .
jules !

is that your mum and dad ?
what haven' t we done for these girls , huh ?
we bought a car for pinky .
jessie wanted computer , music centre , tv , video , huh ?
pinks ...
how do you know teets is the one ?
i just know .
when you' re in love with someone , you' d do anything for that person .
pinks , do you think mum and dad would still speak to me if i ever brought home a gora ?
who ? !
no one .
i' m just saying .
it' s that coach !
i knew something was up when he turned up here !
nothing' s happened .
well , make sure it doesn' t , all right ?
you can marry anyone you want .
it' s fine at first when you' re in love but do you want to be stared at at every family do because you married the english bloke ?
he' s irish .
well , they look the bloody same to them , innit ?
why go to so much grief when there' s so many good looking indian boys to marry ?
it' s not like before , you know ?
they wear good clothes , got flashy jobs and even know how to cook and wash up .
tony' s been mad on you for ages !
jess ?
was that the club chairman ?
yeah .
they told me they' re considering me as assistant coach for the men' s side next year .
that' s great !
congratulations .
probably won' t get it .
better not to count on anything .
well , you deserve it .
i really wanted to say ...
i' ve already forgotten about it .
yeah , good .
me , too .
your parents didn' t look too pleased yesterday .
have you come to tell me you' re off the team for good ?
it' s not fair .
i' m either going to let the team down or piss them off , and i don' t want to upset anyone .
why are they so frightened to let you play ?
they want to protect me .
from what ?
this is taking me away from everything they know .
whose life are you living , jess ?
if you try pleasing ' em for ever , you' re gonna end up blaming ' em .
what , like you ?
i' m sorry .
no , you' re right .
i stopped talking to my dad because we had nothing to talk about .
spent a year getting pissed trying to forget about the game , but i couldn' t .
yeah , but i can' t just stop talking to them , like you .
i don' t talk to my dad because i know what he' d say .
he' d piss himself if he knew i was coaching girls !
how do you know that he wouldn' t be proud that you didn' t just give up ?
you should be proud of what you' ve given all of us .
then why are you giving up ?
jesmin dah , isn' t it ?
jesminder .
jesminder , oh yeah , i' m sorry .
i cooked a lovely curry the other day !
oh , you still not up ?
guess who' s come to see you .
it' s your indian friend , from football .
jules has been ever so down since you lost in germany .
maybe you can cheer her up .
want some tea ?
i' ve just made some cheese straws with real gruyere .
no it' s all right .
jess won' t be staying long .
well ... .. just give us a shout downstairs if there' s anything you two fancy , all right ?
look , i feel really bad about what happened .
yeah , well , you should .
i' m sorry .
i don' t want you to be in a strop with me .
i' m not in a strop !
look , it was a mistake .
i didn' t know what i was doing !
i can' t believe you kissed him !
i didn' t !
yeah , right !
jess , i know what i saw !
you knew he was off limits !
don' t pretend to be so innocent .
you knew exactly how i felt about him !
i didn' t know you were in love with him !
you don' t know the meaning of love !
you' ve really hurt me , jess !
that' s all there is to it !
you' ve betrayed me !
so that' s it ?
yeah , that' s it .
bye !
goodbye , mrs paxton .
what' s going on ?
that is why she' s been so depressed lately !
' cause that jess broke her heart !
she' s in love !
with a girl !
you' re jumping to all the wrong conclusions .
but i heard her !
no wonder she never looked twice at that kevin or brought any boys home !
i tried to get her nice clothes .
you know , we' ve had some lovely prints in this summer .. you know , in swimwear and sarongs and that .. but she never wants to go shopping with me !
it was terrible what they did to that george michael !
going on about him and his private business in the papers like that !
oh , no !
george michael is still a superstar and you still listen to wham ! .
do you fancy me , tony ?
i like you , yeah ...
maybe we can go out , then , yeah ?
jess , what' s going on ?
i think i need an indian boyfriend .
what' s going on ?
you' re acting all weird .
sorry .
you know my coach , yeah ?
yeah .
i nearly kissed him in germany .
wow !
and that' s why you need an indian boyfriend ?
well , jules likes him , too , and now she hates me .
look , jess , you can' t plan who you fall for .
it just happens .
look at posh and becks .
well , beckham' s the best .
i really like beckham , too .
of course you do .
no one can cross a ball or bend it like beckham .
no , jess .
i really like beckham .
what , you mean ... ?
but you' re indian !
i haven' t told anyone .
god , what' s your mum gonna say ? !
my sister thinks you' re mad about me !
i am !
i just don' t want to marry you .
what would those tossers say if they knew ?
jess , you' re not going to tell anyone ?
' course not .
it' s ok , tony .
i mean , it' s ok with me .
yeah , well , you fancying your gora coach is ok with me .
besides ... he' s quite fit !

i can' t keep ' em at the temple all day .
i owe you big time !

she is so hard !
oh , man !
unlucky , tony , mate !

we' ve got qpr in the final .
three cheers hip , hip !
hurray !
hip , hip !
hurray !
hip , hip !
hurray !
brilliant !
why did you yell at me like that ?
you knew the ref was out of order !
you could have cost us the tournament .
but it wasn' t my fault !
you didn' t have to shout at me !
i' m your coach .
i have to treat you the same as everyone else .
look , jess , i saw it .
she fouled you .
she tugged your shirt .
you just over reacted , that' s all .
that' s not all !
she called me a paki , but i guess you wouldn' t understand what that feels like , would you ?
jess , i' m irish .
of course i' d understand what that feels like .
jesminder ?
oh , here he is .
tejinder' s mother and father have come to speak to us .
are you well ?
thank you , yes .
what' s happening ?
teet' s mum and dad have come to eat dirt .
stupid cow !
i don' t know who she thinks she is in that sari !
no mother can stand by and watch her son go through this .
well , our pinky didn' t come out of her room for days .
she was crying .
our teetu also .
for days he ate and drank nothing !
all right .
thank you for coming .

the 25th ?
there' s a cancellation .
no , we need more time .
hold on , please .
the 25th is the only available date .
after that , nothing' s available for five months .
i can' t wait that long !
ok , let' s do it before something else goes wrong !
but , dad , the 25th ...
no , that was not for you .
oh , i' m so excited !
your sister needs you .
mel said you wanted to see me .
it' s about jess .
i don' t want to talk about germany , joe .
listen ...
whatever !
i' m over it !
i don' t know why i was surprised !
you only think about yourself !
everyone knows you' re leaving us next season !
nothing' s been decided .
bollocks !
you' ve already lied about the american scout .
he' s not coming , is he ?
you can' t bear the idea of anyone else making it because you can' t !
he' s coming to the final .
what ?
he saw you play in germany .
i thought ...
don' t worry about it .
jess !
we all missed you at training today .
especially joe .
he told me what happened with your dad .
he did ?
yeah .
he' s worried he' s gotten you into even more trouble .
i' m really in the shit .
dad hasn' t talked to me since .
he' il never let me go back to join the team .
but you can' t miss the final .
jess , there' s gonna be an american scout there .
i can' t .
it' s the same day as my sister' s wedding .
oh , shit !
well , can' t you get away for a bit ?
you don' t understand .
if you give up football now ,
what will you have to give up next ?
don' t rub it in !
you came here because you need me if that bloody scout shows up .
look ...
i came here ' cause joe was worried about you .
i' il tell him he' s wasting his bloody time !
the teriyaki sauce is the goalkeeper .
the posh french mustard is the defender .
the salt is the attacker .
the sea salt ?
the sea salt is the attacker .
now , when the ball' s played forward , the sea salt has to be level with the mustard .
hello , darling .
now watch and concentrate .
offside , onside .
offside , onside .
what are you doing ?
well , if the mountain won' t come to mohammed ...
what ?
i' m trying to teach your mother the offside rule .
i' ve decided that i' ve got to take an interest or i' m going to lose you .
this way we can all enjoy football as a family .
right .
so , don' t tell me .
the offside rule is ... .. when ... .. the french mustard ... has to be between the teriyaki sauce and the sea salt .
she' s got it .
got it !
wonderful !
have you read all these as well ?
yeah .
oh , and do you know what ?
one of those england girls ' players is a maths teacher as well , and she' s happily married with a baby !
.. a level results ... .. a level results ...
hurry up , mum !
good .
thank you !
thank you !
jesminder kaur bhamra ,
b. l. l. b , you can become a fine , top class solicitor now .
clean and serene
dream dream the dream clean and serene

she' s not coming , joe .
her sister' s wedding' s on sunday .
shit !
guess i' m on my own , then .
you' il impress the scout .
no worries .
how was she ?
a right stroppy cow , actually .
she' s really pissed off she can' t make it and she doesn' t know what to do .
go on !
kick the ball , kick the ball !
three players behind you , hunting you !
yes ?
i' m sorry to bother you like this .
i don' have anything to say to you .
i appreciate it and i won' t keep you long , but i wanted you to know that a scout' s coming to our match tomorrow .
so ?
so , it' s the opportunity of a lifetime for jess .

wait !
i' m sorry about the final .
no , i' m sorry , jess .
i got my results .
i' m starting university soon .
i won' t have time to train and stuff .
now that' s a shame .
i could have seen you play for england some day .
jules still has a shot .
she told me about the scout .
sorry i' m letting her down .
that scout' s coming for you , too .
he' s interested in both of you .
me ? !
why are you doing this to me , joe ?
every time i talk myself out of it , you make it sound so easy .
i guess i don' t want to give up on you .
so , are you promised to one of those blokes in there ?
don' t be silly !
i' m not promised to anyone .
you' re lucky ... to have a family that cares that much about you .
i can understand you don' t want to mess with it .
joe ...
and i don' t fancy being busted by your dad again .
you' d better get back .

paxton , bhamra , are you decent ?

oh , is that the coach ?
who' s that ?
dunno .
he looks important .
yeah .
i haven' t seen him before .
look how happy she is .
i know .
i can' t believe it !
it was amazing !
my eyes just glazed over !
what a game for him to see !
it' s incredible !
santa clara !
it' s in california !
it' s one of the top teams !
he said he' d give us a full scholarship so you' il pay nothing !
oh , it' s so amazing !
me and jess there together , the pair of us !
come on , paula .
i' m not blaming you but it is the football .
it is !
come on , darling .
come on .
i' m off , then !
sweetheart , where are you going in your best trousers ?
out .
where ?
who with ?
i' m meeting jess at her sister' s wedding to celebrate .
wait !
i' il take you .
oh , thanks , mum !
my god , it' s so colourful .
everyone looks brilliant !
look at the car !
how are you ?
you look gorgeous !
mum ...
hello , mrs paxton .
how could you be such a hypocrite ?
how could you be all respectful here with your lot when you' ve been kissing my daughter in broad daylight ? !
hmm ?
get your lesbian feet out of my shoes !
lesbian ?
her birthday' s in march .
i thought she was a pisces .
she no lebanese .
she punjabi !
do you mind ?
this is my wedding !
sorry .
how could you do this , sweetheart ?
what is wrong with you ? !
what' s that gora going on about you being a lezbo ?
i thought you fancied your coach !
i don' t know what she was saying !
don' t you want all of this ?
this is the best day of your life , innit ?
i want more than this .
they' ve offered us a scholarship to go to america .
dad won' t let you live abroad without getting married first .
what were you thinking ? !
i saw you with my own eyes !
you were kissing after your match !
i' m not stupid , you know !
and anyway , look at the clothes you wear !
mother , just because i wear trackies and play sport does not make me a lesbian !
me and jess were fighting because we both fancied our coach joe !
what , a man , joe ?
yeah , as in male joe !
joe , our coach !
joe , man , joe !
anyway , being a lesbian is not that big a deal .
oh , no , sweetheart , of course it isn' t .
no !
i mean , i' ve got nothing against it .
i was cheering for martina navratilova as much as the next person .
what was that english woman saying ?
why was she talking about kissing ?
she got confused like teetu' s parents .
it' s so hard when young girls have such short hair .
maybe we were making too much noise .
english people are always complaining when we' re having functions .
why did she take jesminder' s shoes ?
how am i going to tell ' em , tony ?
i' il have to now or i' il end up a solicitor , bored out of my mind .
come with me .
mum , uncle , auntie ...
we' ve got something we want to tell you .
why is he holding her hand ?
we' ve been good friends for a long time now .
we' d like to ask for your blessings .
we' d like to get engaged .
but there' s one condition jesminder goes to college first , anywhere that she wants .
of course , putar !
well , we have relatives all the way in glasgow , in portsmouth ...
mum , dad ...
tony' s lying .
we' re not getting married .
tony only said that to help me , but i' m not lying any more .
i played in the final today , and we won !
when ?
i wasn' t going to go but dad let me .
and it was brilliant .
i played the best ever !
and i was happy because i wasn' t sneaking off and lying to you !
i didn' t ask to be good at football .
guru nanak must have blessed me .
there was a scout from america there today , and he' s offered me a place at a top university with a free scholarship and a chance to play football professionally , and i really want to go , and if i can' t tell you what i want now , then i' il never be happy , whatever i do .
you let her leave her sister' s wedding to go to a football match ? !
maybe you could handle her long face , i could not .
i didn' t have the heart to stop her .
and that' s why she' s ready to go all the way to america now !
she' s dead , man !
it' s all right , mum , just leave it .
when those bloody english cricket players threw me out of their club like a dog ... .. i never complained .
on the contrary , i vowed that i will never play again .
who suffered ?
me .
but i don' t want jessie to suffer .
i don' t want her to make the same mistakes that her father made of accepting life , accepting situations .
i want her to fight .
and i want her to win ... .. because i' ve seen her play .
she is brilliant !
i don' t think anybody has the right of stopping her .
two daughters made happy in one day .
what else can a father ask for ?
at least i' ve taught her full indian dinner .
the rest is up to god .
joe !
i' m going !
they said i could go !
sorry .
i forgot .
it' s ok now .
i' m not your coach any more .
we can do what we want .
joe ...
your dad' s not here , is he ?
i' m sorry , joe .
i can' t .
i thought you wanted ...
letting me go is a really big step for my mum and dad .
i don' t know how they' d survive if i told them about you , too .
i guess there' s not much point with you going to america anyway , is there ?
it' s not perfume , is it ?
no .
it' s not what you think .
it was your mum' s idea .
oh !
thank you so much !
keep this by your bed .
phone papu uncle in canada as soon as you land .
at least there' s some family close by .
it' s getting really late .
you' d better board the plane .
jess !
don' t worry .
that' s her coach .
what are you doing here ?
they offered me the job , coaching the men' s side .
no more pulling pints .
that' s great , joe !
i turned them down .
why did you ... ?
i' m going to coach the girls ' side .
they want us to turn pro next year .
can' t keep losing my best players to the yanks , can i ?
that' s brilliant !
you should tell your dad , you know .
i already did .
are we doing the right thing ?
whatever god has written for her will happen .
maybe i' il sign you if i can afford you !
yeah , you wish !
look ...
i can' t let you go without knowing .
what ?
that even with the distance and the concerns of your family , we might still have something .
what do you think ?
oh , my god , it' s beckham !
it' s a sign !
jess , it' s becks !
' cause you make me feel  ' cause you make me feel ...
i' m back at christmas .
we' il tackle my mum and dad then .
i' d better go .
take care of yourself .
