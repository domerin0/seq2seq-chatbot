nurse espinoza , do you by any chance know what time your 9 . 30 shift starts ?
9 : 30 ?
that' s what i would' ve said .
but i had ted stand out in the parking lot and monitor your arrival times this week .
ted ?
9 . 34 , 9 . 39 , 9 . 41 , 9 . 33 and 9 . 50 .
how is that law degree working out for you , ted ?
i was going to be a senator .
i haven' t perused the latest nursing contract ,
i' m guessing it doesn' t say " show up when you damn well please .
here' s an idea .
what say you stop showing up altogether and we' il replace you with a giant time clock ?
if we ever miss you , we' il just have a bob kelso cuckoo bird pop out every few minutes and say , " i' ve never satisfied a woman .
come on , ted .
dr cox didn' t know he was the father of jordan' s baby , but they were getting along better .
i love you .
i love you .
as for us , it was the end of our second year , and each day had begun to feel the same .
after a while , your residency boils down to just a few things .
paperwork .
the three prescriptions every patient gets .
acetaminophen for her headache ,
restoril so she' il sleep , and colace so she' il poop .
paperwork .
mind numbing monotony .
and , of course , paperwork .
as for the patients ...
look , because it' s diabetes related , the pain in your foot isn' t responding to pain killers .
i' d like to try an anti seizure medication before we consider amputation .
good , because i have an audition for stomp tomorrow .
look , just cut the damn thing off , will ya ?
that' s why i' m so psyched our college buddy ,
spence , was coming to town .
jill anderson .
yes .
no .
monica meyer .
yeah .
yes .
i don' t think it' s appropriate for us to be rehashing our college sexual conquests with carla in the other room .
leslie stevens .
yes !
on a pile of coats with hundreds of people around .
what a whore !
who else ?
who else did you bang ?
carla , college wasn' t all sex and coats .
spence here got me through a lot of hard times .
why don' t you just mousse the crap out of it ?
straight up .
yes .
my life changed that day .
man , that was a long time ago .
now you two are engaged , i' m in town because two frat brothers are getting married .
a double wedding ?
no .
good for the boys .
the point is , we' ve really grown up .
that' s good , good sauce .
check it out .
free pitcher .
what i' ve got you on is d five half normal saline with 20 kcl at 1 00ccs an hour .
the cadillac of all hangover cures .
it feels warm in my tummy .
good morning , angels .
did you have one too many daiquiris last night ?
spence , this is dr cox and ...
don' t bother .
don' t care .
he' s the scary man you told me about last night .
hey , congratulations .
for what , jackass ?
you just had a baby .
no , she just had a baby .
but you said it was his .
and you said something else .
that he didn' t know it yet .
that' s exactly right .
holy crap .
run away .
run away .
run away .
ok , he hasn' t said a word in over ten minutes .
the hell with it .
i' m going in .
dr cox ...
if the next words aren' t " see you . " the third will be ,
my crotch , you' ve punched me in the crotch .
see you .
how about that guy ?
yeah .
that guy ?
yeah .
maybe it would be easier if i told you whose butt i haven' t had my fingers in .
that' s a perk you never hear about .
you guys landed your dream jobs , huh ?
dream job .
hey , man , how am i supposed to finish this memo ?
i don' t know .
do you have any interesting patients ?
mr weinberg has dementia but still enjoys his ronking .
what' s ronking ?
ronk !
lnteresting .
hey , sweetness .
ronk .
when do people yell " stat " ?
kinda never .
bambi , rounds .
dammit .
run , johnny , run .
trying to add a little drama .
i felt it .
this is not a good day to be late .
every year , kelso picks a resident to ride mercilessly until they crumble .
the key is to jump on any easy question and impress him early .
right , shall we get started ?
y es !
excuse me ?
should we get started ?
yes .
wow ...
dr reid , do an abg on bed four without waking him .
dr ...
young asian fellow , bed seven needs a central line .
dr murphy and dr eager beaver , step forward .
this is it .
last man standing .
what are the four differential diagnoses of the persistent st elevation on any ekg ?
dorian .
lschemia .
murphy .
aneurysm .
dorian .
pericarditis .
murphy .
pass .
ah , doug .
at least you' re going to a more chocolaty place .
dr murphy .
ronk !
dr reid !
a moment , please .
no , you didn' t .
i did .
every time i turn around , dr kelso' s riding me .
i' ve got next .
what' s up ?
no one ?
self five .
for the big dog .
look , elliot , i' ve seen this before .
kelso worries he' s not scary , so he picks somebody to be his bitch .
who he picks is totally random .
unless you throw a needle in his face .
ok , i didn' t tell you the kid was yours and you' re upset .
i get it .
but you seem to be making a really big deal out of this .
is there something else that' s bothering you ?
it' s mostly just the kid thing .
i didn' t want you to feel pressured to be with me .
i didn' t want you to feel manipulated .
i am so , so sorry , but no matter what you say , you don' t have a leg to stand on .
i don' t know about that , perry .
sounds like she' s trying to protect your relationship .
some mothers say the only way to get a guy to marry you
is by using pregnancy as a trap .
what ?
stupid mothers who got even meaner when they stopped drinking .
morning .
i make more than you do .
what ?
i saw your paycheck .
i make more than you do .
quite a bit more .
you couldn' t have seen it .
no way i could access the personnel files .
just impossible .
by the way , 987654320 .
my social security number .
no .
that' s your pln number .
no , my pln number is 3674 .
bingo .
do you have any idea what it feels like to have a janitor make more than you ?
johnny .
investment banker .
so , no .
why , christopher ?
i' ve saved up 500 bucks .
where would you put that if you were me ?
a wallet , a money clip .
you could get schmitty and dan a wedding gift .
dan wants a ferret .
ferrets are nice .
they' re mean .
let' s go do something special tonight .
my treat .
we gotta kinda lay low tonight .
we' re on backup call .
see , now , this is the proper way to lay low .
i mean , honestly , does it get any better ?
no , it does not .
why do you keep looking at me like that ?
people .
ed , did you turn on the jets in the hot tub ?
no .
it' s too hot on my eyes !
those sutures look awful , don' t you think , ted ?
i don' t know , sir .
yes ?
no ?
i' m barely here .
i know what you' re doing , sir , the whole keep us scared thing .
i' m ok with it .
dr reid .
even if you hadn' t just missed blinding me earlier ,
i still would' ve picked you to crap on .
you' re easily startled , you' re constantly overwhelmed .
while you work hard , you still struggle to break into the middle of the pack .
i chose you because i am hoping that you will ask yourself , really ask yourself , if there isn' t some other profession you might be better suited for .
in the meantime , be a doll and re suture that wound .
wanna get a beer later ?
i can' t believe you didn' t tell me .
and while we' re coming completely clean , perry ,
i' m not the girl they' re singing about in my sharona .
her name' s sharona .
you' re making jokes ?
i just want this to be ok .
don' t get me wrong .
i wanna be with the kid .
i' m damn sure gonna be with the kid .
but as far as you and i go ... ... i just don' t see us working out .
nothing like cold beers in a jacuzzi .
am i right , ed ?
some days i sit out here for hours , downing cold one after cold one .
what do you do when you have to pee ?
so you boys are doctors , huh ?
ok , whoa , frannie .
that was my ass .
you guys have to go to work ?
no , it' s just a stupid intern .
the only way we have to go in is if there was some catastrophe .
in breaking news , there' s been a multiple car pile up on the throughway .
plus , the two guys on call would have to be simultaneously incapacitated .
this is my chance to shine .
what' s up , chica ?
whoa !
oh , god !
part of being a doctor is learning to deal with the unexpected .
whether it' s someone who won' t take no for an answer .
i' ve decided not to accept the being dumped thing .
i' m gonna hang around until you forgive me .
or being shaken to your very core .
sometimes it' s just having to work in wet grundies .
hey , betty , wilma .
what the hell ?
you' re only 40 minutes late .
do i smell beer ?
we had a few .
newsflash : you can' t drink and then come to work .
you' re not airline pilots .
look , dr cox ...
no , you look .
if someone had asked me just this morning , is there any way that i could have any less respect for you two geniuses , i would have said , that' s not possible .
lo and behold , you pulled it off .
congratulations .
the only problem is i' m fresh out of blue ribbons , so instead you' il have to settle for a lifetime supply of my foot up your ass .
go home .
you' re not fit to work tonight .
great speech .
you guys are in trouble .
wait up , i' ve got my heels on .
after what happened , i was in no mood to be messed with .
hey , food stamps .
little anonymous donation from a guy who makes a little more scratch than you .
you know what ?
at least what i do matters .
ok ?
you' re cleaning the same spot you were this morning .
the smart money says you' il be cleaning it tomorrow .
why don' t i just come by then , and you can tell me how what you do day after day makes even the slightest bit of difference in this world ?
too mean .
i don' t care if i hurt his feelings , i got absolutely crushed tonight .
turk and i both knew who was responsible for all this .
crockett .
tubbs .
when do we eat ?
jordan , could you just give me ten seconds to myself here ?
no .
you know , you are being very immature and , oh , my god , is that guy on fire ?
dr cox , i' m so glad you' re here .
from one hell to another .
dr kelso' s been torturing me lately .
i thought i could handle it .
i' ve come a long way .
i was afraid of you , and now i can talk to you ,
iike how your hair' s been looking springy lately , not like the season , like the inside of a mattress .
i don' t have any clue what you mean .
dr kelso' s starting to get to me , and i don' t think i can take it anymore .
sorry , kid , but i' m dealing with my own stuff right now .
thanks a lot ... really .
howdy , mop top .
oh , god .
man , why' d you even show up this weekend ?
what are you talking about ?
i introduced schmitty and dan .
ok , i didn' t really introduce them .
i' m the one who accidentally saw them under the foosball table .
oh , schmitty .
typical spence .
you just blow into town and get us into trouble .
what ?
i made you guys go out tonight ?
hey , i have a presentation on thursday .
ask me if i' il go out drinking wednesday night .
you wanna go out ... ?
sorry .
i can' t , i have a presentation .
the truth is , you' ve been complaining about work since the second i got here , dying for an excuse to blow it off .
so maybe you should stop being all mad at me when , really , you' re just pissed because you hate your jobs .
every time i turn around , kelso' s there .
ted , he' s trying to break my spirit .
do you have any idea what that feels like ?
i' m sorry .
of course you do .
dr reid , i' m afraid that nothing you' ve described constitutes harassment .
swing and a miss , eh , dr reid ?
the next time you decide to make a stink over nothing , you should see a lawyer who didn' t need five tries to pass the bar exam .
i have stress induced dyslexia and you know that , dr oslek .
why are you doing this ?
i' il tell you why , perry .
we' ve been dancing the same dance for years now .
one gets angry and walks away , the other' s too stubborn to go after them .
before you know it , you sleep with some pharmaceutical rep ,
i' m convincing my mom that the thing in my suitcase is a giant electric melon baller .
guess what ?
things are different now .
we have a kid together .
i' m not going home until you promise you' re coming with me .
you go home .
i' il meet you there later .
bring dinner .
you' re a father .
can you believe it ?
nope .
i didn' t get a lot of sleep thinking about what spence had said .
look , i' m sorry i was such a jerk yesterday .
ok ?
come on , look at this floor .
you could practically eat off of it .
would you ?
would i what ?
would you eat off the floor ?
as i bent down to eat that peppered floor turkey , unaware that the cleanser the janitor uses is an extremely potent diuretic , i realised something .
the reason we ' re doctors is because we have an innate desire to help people .
that was disgusting .
you have to have that desire , because at the end of your second year , it' s impossible to see the light at the end of the tunnel .
so it becomes about perseverance .
and fortitude .
and sacrifice .
sorry you guys can' t make the wedding .
give them a big kiss for us .
t ell them the ferret only eats fresh vegetables .
i' m gonna miss you guys .
i' il see ya later .
later , dude .
really , all you can hope for is an occasional thank you .
i' m so glad the medication worked .
i' m supposed to be happy cos somebody did something right ?
you' re welcome .
nice call on the anti seizure medicine .
i' m starting to think you may not be the worst resident that ever lived .
how cool was that ?
shut up .
you shut up .
you' re an angry man .
sorry i didn' t tell you about the " it' s your baby " thing .
we' il probably talk about that later .
i wasn' t even mad at jordan .
no ?
i was scared .
i was freaking out , cos i' m confident that i' il be a horrible father .
you ?
come on .
you' re gonna be a very scary ...
i mean , great .
you' re gonna be a great father .
last night , you totally kicked our asses cos we deserved it .
remember you told me i wasn' t the worst resident that ever lived ?
eight seconds ago ?
you have no idea how much that meant to me .
i said , i think you may not be the worst resident ever , but i can' t be sure of stuff like that .
i haven' t done the legwork .
you' re always there when we need you .
i think you have this fathering thing down .
why am i not leaving , dr reid ?
i don' t want to miss you breaking down and weeping in front of everyone .
here it comes .
great big tears .
great big crocodile tears .
if she was your daughter , you' d totally know how to handle it .
my god , you' re right .
you' re doing fine , barbie .
thank you .
everybody have a good one .
i' m going home to see my son .
excuse me there , bobbo .
right in the nose .
yeah .
that may come up tomorrow .
