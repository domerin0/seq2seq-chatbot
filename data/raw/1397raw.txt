you' re in luck .
you can' t buy a stove like this easily nowadays .
it' s almost impossible to find any hardware to sell .
i' il take that comb , and ...
do you have an umbrella ?
an umbrella ...
oh yes !
it' s raining , it' s raining .
big brother' s coming home with an umbrella just for me .
drip drop , plip plop .
down the rain comes !
that' s got it !
be careful with that fire .
right ...
what are they up to ?
they' re doing their own cooking .
good for them !
more please .
mother , did you scold them again ?
yes , but they refuse to apologize .
and that boy even bought a stove .
just to spite me !
finished !
bad manners , seita .
doesn' t matter .
we can sit any way we want .
rice for two .
that' s it ?
next ration will be in july .
let me !
like it ?
it' s all different tastes !
grape , strawberry , melon , mint .
all in there .
drink it all .
all gone .
great ...
left the dishes for me to do .
so selfish ...
honestly !
those brats are two of the worst !
not again !
mama !
mama !
seita , my daughter and that man work for our nation !
we can' t have her crying keep them awake .
we' ve enough trouble getting sleep with the air raids !
report from central military division .
several waves of enemy bombers are approaching .
going to the shelter again , seita ?
you' re old enough to help fight the fires , aren' t you ?
i want to go home .
i hate living with her !
we don' t have a house to go back to .
with a great big streamer shaped like a carp ... ... and longer than a house .
the big one' s the papa , the little ones the kids .
stop it !
don' t you realize there' s a war going on ? !
you two are nothing but trouble for me !
a couple of pests , that' s what you are !
you' re no help at all during the raids .
you could just go and live in that shelter for all i care !
that' s it .
we' il live here .
no one uses it .
it' s sturdy .
we can live like we want !
can we really live here ? !
we' ve bothered you long enough .
we' re leaving now .
leaving ... ?
for where ?
haven' t really decided yet .
well , take care of yourselves .
bye bye , setsuko !
this' il be the kitchen !
this' il be the front door !
where' s the bathroom ?
that can be anywhere .
wanna go somewhere with me ?
thanks for the wagon .
just leave it there .
do you think you can sell us some food and straw ?
i guess .
not much left , though .
my mouth' s watering !
man , am i hungry .
well , we can always eat frogs .
frogs ?
they' re great .
you' d better get under the mosquito net .
what' s wrong ?
i forgot my toothbrush .
one night without it won' t matter .
it' s getting buggy .
you' d better get under the net .
it' s dark in there .
i' m scared .
i have to take a leak .
how about you ?
a kamikaze .
it looks like a firefly .
yeah ...
let' s catch some .
okay , get in .
i can see you !
i can see you , too .
a hair clip .
okay , let' s get as many as we can !
i went to a naval review , once .
before you were born .
naval review ... ?
uh huh .
dad' s cruiser , the " maya " , was in formation with the fleet .
mighty fortresses floating on the seas ...
defending our homeland from invaders near and far .
enemy plane !
i wonder where dad is fighting now ...
get off me , seita !
whatcha doing ?
making a grave .
mama' s in a grave too .
auntie told me .
she said mama died , and she' s in a grave now .
we' il visit her grave sometime .
do you remember the graveyard , the one near nunobiki ?
that' s where she is .
under a big camphor tree ...
why do fireflies have to die so soon ?
hey , it looks like somebody' s living here .
probably lost their house .
maybe it' s some crazy hermit .
it' s a swing .
a kid lives here .
what' s this ?
rest in peace !
wish it was real food .
it says " setsuko " .
look !
dried frogs !
who' d wanna eat that ? !
nobody i know would ever eat this stuff !
ground soybeans !
and i thought the food i got was bad !
a ghost !
i' ve traded everything for rice .
even my mom' s kimono .
there' s nothing left to trade .
please , i can pay you money for the rice ...
sorry .
i can' t trade or sell anything to you .
i' m a farmer , but even i don' t have any rice to share .
don' t you have other relatives ?
i can' t contact them .
then take my advice and go back to that woman .
everything' s rationed now .
you can' t survive outside of the system .
just swallow your pride and apologize to her .
thanks anyway .
i' il ask someone else .
you' re a navy man' s son , right ?
try to be brave .
should we ?
uh oh !
it doesn' t matter if you like it or not .
you have to eat !
you need to , so you can grow up !
seita ...
i i feel funny .
are you cold ?
i' ve been having diarrhea ...
why you ... !
i' m sorry !
sir , forgive me !
i didn' t mean to .
my sister' s sick .
i just wanted to get her some sugar !
yeah , sure !
stealing food' s a serious crime in wartime !
you god damned ... !
come back here !
what the hell ... ? !
potatoes too ? !
so you' re the one who' s been stealing around here !
seita !
i' m sorry !
i' il never do it again , i swear !
tell it to the cops !
i' il take you there myself !
now walk !
i hope they lock you up !
please , she' s sick !
she needs me !
seita !
seita !
seita ...
the nature of the crime is fairly clear , i think .
thank you , i' il handle this .
you may go .
but officer ...
you' ve knocked this poor kid around enough .
i' m even tempted to call it ... assault !
i ... er ...
thank you officer !
they hit fukui tonight .
would you like a glass of water ?
setsuko ...
seita !
seita ...
where does it hurt ?
should i get a doctor ?
setsuko !
seita , i have to go to the bathroom .
can it wait ?
hop on .
brother' s gone to the mountain to bring back some firewood ...
setsuko .
dinner .
this pumpkin' s great .
tastes just like sweet bean jelly .
don' t like that stuff .
look , if you don' t eat , dad' il blame me for it .
come on , i' il even help you .
now cheer up and eat !
once you get better , i' il take you to the beach again .
now i' il really get you something good to eat , setsuko !
seita ...
seita ...
these were your mother' s ?
don' t make me laugh !
don' t try to pawn off this garbage on me !
setsuko ...
setsuko !
seita ...
water ...
breathe in .
and out .
she' s been having diarrhea for a while now .
prickly heat ...
rashes ...
and salt water hurts her skin .
weakening from malnutrition .
probably due to the diarrhea .
next ?
can you give her medicine ?
a shot ?
don' t wanna shot .
please doctor , help her !
medicine ...
all this child needs is food .
food ...
what' s wrong ?
where do i get food ? !
boy am i hungry .
what do you want to eat ?
tempura ...
sashimi ...
jelly ...
anything else ?
ice cream ...
and also ...
i want fruit drops ...
drops ...
okay !
i' il withdraw the money and buy you all the food you need .
don' t want anything ...
you can have it ...
don' t go !
stay with me !
don' t leave me alone !
don' t worry , setsuko .
i' il buy you some good , nourishing food .
and i' il never leave you again .
never , ever again .
i promise .
3000 yen .
there' s a typhoon coming ?
great , we get our " divine wind " after we surrender .
figures ...
surrender ... ?
we' ve lost the war ? !
haven' t you heard ?
japan' s lost ?
the great japanese empire ?
yeah ...
surrendered unconditionally .
what about the fleet ?
all gone .
sent to the bottom .
not one left afloat .
what ? !
was my dad' s ship sunk too ? !
is that why he hasn' t written ? !
how should i know ?
crazy kid ...
damn him !
i' m so hungry ...
dad ...
now dad' s gone too ...
he' s dead too ...
dad ...
sorry i' m so late .
i' il make you some rice .
up they go ...
and down again ...
oh ...
firefly' s stopped ...
i bought us some chicken and eggs .
and also ...
setsuko , what' s in your mouth ? !
this is a marble .
it isn' t a drop !
i brought you something i know you like .
seita ...

setsuko ...
what' s ... ?
rice balls ...
i made them for you ...
here ...
have one ...
you don' t want them ... ?
setsuko !
look , it' s a watermelon .
i didn' t steal it , either .
here , eat it .
it' s good ...
hold on , i' il make you some rice gruel with eggs .
i' il leave the melon here for you .
okay ?
seita ...
thank you ...
she never woke up .
there .
charcoal for the cremation .
since it' s a child , you should do it at a temple .
the body should be lightly dressed .
use beanstalks for a good fire .
beautiful day , in spite of it all .
it hasn' t changed a bit .
it' s good to be home !
look !
the old phonograph ...
i' ve missed this view .
come back soon !
the next morning , i put some of setsuko' s ashes into ... ... the candy tin , and then climbed down the hill .
i never went back to the shelter .
seita ...
time for bed .
okay ?
