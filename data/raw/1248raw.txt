his buddy' s fixed it with the camera guys .
the celebrity thinks they' re out to get him .
he always eats in the same joint .
he' s sure they' il film him there .
the others convince him there' s a hidden camera .
he sees the tv truck , a camera behind the mirror and the guy with him pretends to act weird .
the celebrity thinks he' il fool ' em , pretending he hasn' t noticed .
he thinks all hell will break loose .
but they just film him , jumpy , waiting for shit to happen .

the celebrity' s sweating , trying to act cool .
each time the waiter passes he thinks it' il happen .
then a guy asks him for his autograph .
the celeb thinks it' s a trick and starts ranting at the guy , who doesn' t know what' s up , so he gets mad .
they start fighting , and the candid camera guys have to break it up .
it was a killer punch out .

i once had a friend called grunwalski .
we were sent to siberia together .
when you go to a siberian work camp , you travel in a cattle car .
you roll across icy steppes for days , without seeing a soul .
you huddle to keep warm .
but it' s hard to relieve yourself , to take a shit , you can' t do it on the train , and the only time the train stops is to take on water for the locomotive .
but grunwalski was shy .
even when we bathed together , he got upset .
i used to kid him about it .
so , the train stops and everyone jumps out to shit on the tracks .
i' d teased grunwalski so much that he went off on his own .
the train starts moving , so everyone jumps on , because it waits for nobody .
grunwalski had a problem : he' d gone behind a bush and was still shitting .
so i see him come out from behind the bush , holding up his pants with his hands .
he tries to catch up .
i hold out my hand , but each time he reaches for it he lets go of his pants and they drop to his ankles .
he pulls them back up , starts running again , but they fall back down , when he reaches out for me .
then what happened ?
nothing .
grunwalski ... froze to death .
good day .
why' d he tell us that ?
i got the address .
i' il call you .
why' d he tell us that ?
' scuse me , i' m just out of the hospital .
i haven' t eaten for 2 days .
my child' s hungry , i need your spare change ...
