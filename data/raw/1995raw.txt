josh' s vital signs are dropping .
what ?
serge !
you' re almost there .
you' re almost there , josh .
josh !
joshua !
okay , guys , connect the oxygen .
braz , you got that ?
yes .
connected !
good .
i got to check these lasers .
okay , beck , turn ' em over .
pre lasers only , if you don' t mind .
lnitiating .
this better work .
the tide' s really coming in .
yes !
we got lucky i think we' re going to swim right out of this one .
bob ?
huh ?
bob ?
bob ...
braz , come on , it' s over .
okay .
okay .
beck !
beck !
we' re coming in .
lnitiate start sequence .
beck !
beck , do you hear me ?
careful .
start the impellers !
the door , open the door .
activate bulkhead doors !
now , beck !
you okay ?
you' re going to be weak .
you' re okay .
good job , good job .
good man .
well done , well done .
i' m fine .
thank you .
so , um ... we have some good news , and , uh ... and we have some bad news .
uh , good news .
i' il take good news .
all right .
well , we' re alive and we' re moving .
that' s g ... that' s good news .
oh , it is hot in here .
yeah , that nitro we flushed out of the cooling system , it it' s causing things just to heat up a little .
i' m going to go back and just make some adjustments .
i' il lend you a hand .
all right .
i' m fine .
i' m going to check your heartbeat , okay ?
thanks , braz .
appreciate it .
so , that' s the bad news ?
that' s not too bad .
no .
commander lverson died .
but ... we' re living , and he would want to ... he' d want us to complete our mission , so i think that it' s important that we all ...
it' s all right .
thank you .
i' m sorry .
let' s give him a second , okay ?
he deserves that .
oh , god , this all just seems too big , doesn' t it ?
i think you were attempting the impossible .
you were trying to save the world , and ... it' s overwhelming .
i came here to save my wife and my two children and ... six billion lives it' s too much .
i just hope i' m i' m smart enough and brave enough to save three .
you did a nice job , joshua .
very nice .
great .
you' d have done the same thing .
well , maybe , maybe .
hey ... who' s steering the ship ?
video screen autopilot .
i hope he knows the way .
you and me both .
so ... you' re really a college professor ?
you' re not from the cla , or the nsa or any of those three letter places ?
no .
i am a boring college professor .
wrong place , wrong place .
that was the bravest thing i' ve ever seen .
well , i just , i just ...
listen , the lack of oxygen kept me from weeping like a little girl as is my custom in dangerous situations .
hey , guys , we' re close to the mantle core interface .
where are you ?
key' s in , dr. brazzleton .
ready .
we are in the ...
okay , the code ... 0 1 3 1 9 9 5 . ... luxurious , beautiful weapons control ... checking the controls on the nukes .
this is the birthday of my daughter .
0 1 3 1 9 9 5 .
ready ?
yeah .
three , two and one ..
thank you .
green .
all green .
great .
so we have to synchronize the babies now .
just a second .
there .
all right , now let' s put them to bed .
zimsky , could you please come up here for a second ?
yes ?
we' re not supposed to go through anything black .
yes , so please don' t .
what is this ?
they' re scattered everywhere .
oh , my god !
they' re diamonds !
great .
you might want to sit down and buckle up .
we' re on a collision course here .
all rightie .
careful .
guys , we' re dodging diamonds the size of cape cod , so bear with me .
not exactly nimble here .
diamonds ?
i want some .
can i help ?
ooh !
okay .
it' s okay .
okay , it looks like we' re in the clear .
breach !
guys !
weapons control , get out !
get out now !
serge !
serge !
what the hell are you doing ?
come on !
my notebook !
now !
serge !
take the time reg , joshua !
come on serge !
come on !
my notes !
you' il need them !
no !
god , no , serge !
it' s okay .
serge , come on !
no !
serge !
come on , man !
leave the box !
we need the box !
we can get him !
we can get him out !
hold on , serge !
beck !
beck !
override the ejection system !
beck , no !
one damaged compartment threatens the whole ship !
beck !
beck !
override the ejection system !
serge , we' re right here .
we' re not going to forget about you , man .
josh , can you hear me ?
serge !
serge ...
hey , buddy , look in your monitor right now .
serge , look in your monitor .
i' m right here .
serge ...
josh , i can' t see you .
braz is going to override the doors manually , okay ?
we' re working on it right now .
braz , how long ?
going as fast as i can , fast as i can .
okay , i' m scared .
we' re going right now .
shouldn' t be two seconds , all right ?
josh !
beck , override the ejection systems , okay ?
damn .
i don' t think beck can hear me .
serge , look at me now .
serge !
serge , we' re right here , okay ?
we' re not going to forget about you , man .
i' m going to get you out of here .
we' re working on it , all right ?
stay with me here .
okay ?
i don' t know what to do .
can you hear me now ?
all right , here i am .
i' m not going to let you go , man .
i' m not going to let you go , all right ?
stay with me here , okay ?
i' m going to come to paris and we' il go out , all right ?
after this .
after this is all said and done , all right ?
josh !
serge !
serge !
serge !
serge !
serge !
did you reset the overrides ?
i never pushed them .
you let him die .
actually , you really want to know ?
i killed him twice .
first when i hit the diamond , and then when i didn' t hit the override .
do you want me to feel any worse about that than i already do ?
it' s not possible .
why are you being so smug about that ?
could you have made the decision ?
yes .
could you ?
yes , i could' ve .
lf you would' ve hit that switch ,
i could' ve got him outta there !
i was yelling for you !
take it and look at it !
i was two inches from him !
i was two inches , and i told you to put the door up and you didn' t !
i was screaming for you !
why didn' t you do it ? !
because i had to make that decision .
fate or god ...
no !
damn it !
you leave god out of this !
serge died so that we could complete our job .
oh , that' s right , the job of saving the world .
not the whole world , josh !
just three of them .
virgil , you are approaching core interface .
are you good to go ?
josh ?
josh , can you hear me ?
josh , can you hear me ?
ready as we' il ever be , stick .
dr. keyes .
right here .
deep earth , we are green and good to go .
we just got a huge speed jump .
we just got a huge speed jump .
we' re at 95 knots .
1 10 .
130 ... 1 40 .
our speed' s jumped because the density of the core is different than our estimates .
it' s lighter than we thought .
so much for best guesses .
i' m fine with this .
at this rate , we' il , what hit the inner core in a little over five hours .
i think we finally bought some luck .
braz .
yeah .
would you please punch the new core density into the equations for the nuclear detonation ?
please tell me this is enough .
okay .
you' re telling me the 1 , 000 megatons of nuclear warheads we hauled down here isn' t going to cut it ?
no .
this core material is too thin .
what ?
the energy waves from the explosion won' t spread far enough .
they' il just bleed away into nothing .
that' s it .
we go home .
we go home .
home ?
what ?
our commander is dead .
our weapons specialist is dead .
our weapons control systems are gone .
we don' t know whether we can arm the nuclear devices , and our plan to fix the core no longer works .
so ... we have failed .
we have not failed .
we have failed , and we go home , and we go to the alternative .
what alternative ?
what are you talking about ?
general , this is dr. conrad zimsky .
destiny is a go .
repeat .
destiny is a go .
damn .
i need to know evetything to do my job .
you don' t have to know this .
general , it is my job to ensure the safety of this mission .
anything that affects it is my business .
now what the hell is destiny ?
it' s a device .
deep earth seismic trigger lnitiative , dest lnl .
destiny .
we had reason to believe that our enemies were building a weapon that could generate targeted seismic events .
they would be able to create massive earthquakes under our territory .
no way of telling who did it .
so ?
so ... we built one , too .
m. a. d.
mutually assured destruction .
a perfect acronym if ever there was one .
beautiful .
they built it first .
i built it better .
i beamed high powered electromagnetic energy waves down deep earth fault lines , and , you know .
zimsky , what makes you think that destiny would even touch the core ?
' cause it already did .
this isn' t a fluke .
we killed the planet .
you keep saying that the core is too big to be affected by anything short of nukes .
so ...
the core is an engine .
throw a small wrench into a big engine , you can still stall it .
deep earth , this is virgil .
we require clarification on the status of project destiny .
why weren' t we notified of this , sir ?
because you didn' t need to know , major .
now you may not like this .
i may not like it either .
but it' s my job , and i do it for my country , and if we don' t develop these devices , someone worse will and they will use them against us . but you have my word .
no one in this administration no one , had any idea that this could happen .
so the device that killed the planet is your backup plan ?
an electric shock can stop a heart .
it can certainly restart one .
destiny will work .
it has to .
no , it won' t work .
lf you fire that thing again with the core already stalled , it' il terminally destabilize it .
yes , granted there is a marginal risk involved , but given the circumstances ,
i hardly see that there' s an alternative .
no , zimsky , listen to me .
every volcano on the planet will blow .
there' il be earthquakes big enough to rip us to pieces .
dr. keyes .
what ?
i' m afraid it' s all we' ve got .
now , i have orders from the president .
come home , virgil .
we go to plan b.
well , what about plan c ?
what ?
what ?
well , plan c.
we continue on .
we restart the core ... somehow .
we don' t do it , you fire destiny .
i can' t wait for you to get out of there .
then don' t .
we fail , fire destiny .
oh , come on !
that' s ridiculous !
what choice do we have ,
zimsky ?
are you kidding me ?
lf they set that thing off , the shock waves will wipe us out !
we' il be lucky to get back if we turn back right now !
virgil , i' m telling you right now , we will fire destiny , and we need to do so as quickly as possible , and if you' re still there , you will be destroyed .
rebecca ?
please don' t make me have to do this .
plan c.
it' s your call , commander .
majority decision .
we' re going in .
i' m sorry , sir .
oh , come on , you' re a bunch of suicidal morons !
what are you , crazy ?
plan c ?
restart the core " somehow " ?
oh , that' s a great idea !
that' s a brilliant idea !
i can' t believe i' m stuck in this floating septic tank with you lunatics !
you may have nothing to lose .
you may have nothing to lose !
you may have nothing to lose but i have my life to lose , thank you very much while you' re up !
now turn it around !
he told us to go back and we' re going back !
why ?
you want to be a hero ?
you want to be a martyr ?
what do you want to be ?
you' re out of your mind !
thank you !
turn it around !
no !
zimsky .
you , shut up !
it' s not a stupid ship .
i had to .
it had to happen sometime .
yeah .
oh ...
status !
what is that ?
it' s the em monitoring station .
it' s the one that tracks em pulses .
god , no .
just talk , mr. rat .
no .
that' s a good boy .
remember those invisible microwaves that josh was talking about ?
well , they just found a hole .
no , it' s a parking lot out here ...
oh , my god .
and now with this horrific breaking news , we go live to san francisco , where leo jacks has the story .
yes , claire , it' s hard to believe that half of san francisco is in ruins today following the most devastating and the most baffling event in our nation' s history .
it' s it' s a horrific situation here .
thousands are dead .
many are missing .
it' s it' s hotels , hospitals .
bring up the power grid .
the whole west coast is out .
that means we' re going to have to suck up just about every drop of juice east of the rockies to fire destiny .
another em spike , we' re not going to have enough power .
general , you have got to give them more time .
there is no more time .
colonel , call destiny .
i am launching a formal complaint against you with the department of defense .
rat to josh .
go , rat .
hey , um ... here' s the em field data that you' re primed for .
digging that , rat .
primed for .
primed for .
prime numbers one , two , three , five , seven , 1 1 , 13 , 1 7 ...
here we go .
james .
yes , sir .
yes , sir .
here we go , folks .
okay , this time it' s going to work .
here you go ... beautiful .
yeah , mm hmm .
come on , baby .
come on , daddy wants to see the sky again .
okay , okay , okay .
let' s try again .
your torque is r , cross f ...
no , your r is too small , josh .
right .
wait , hold on .
what are you laughing at ?
no , i mean , it took me and 400 of the world' s smartest people to come up with the first plan .
you want to help ?
no .
i want to turn around and go home .
it' s not going to happen .
well , then we' re going to die .
true .
all right , look ,
let' s start from square one .
okay .
let' s start from square one .
the bulk modules depends on density .
your torque is r cross f , but you have to integrate volume ...
but here , here ... just consider this .
now , we got this ...
okay , now , r cross f , we' re putting in pi .
what' s v ?
oh , for god' s sake !
all right .
i' m hitting him again .
no , no , no !
braz , no , look , i have a theory .
are you interested ?
yes .
we' re interested .
then let me smoke a cigarette , and i' il tell you .
oh , thank god .
hmm ?
all right , fine , look .
look , we have to use wave interference , okay ?
because one explosion won' t do it .
think about stones in a pond .
you drop a large stone into a pond , you get a big splash , and then that' s it , it' s over .
but drop a smaller stone , wait until the ripples weaken and drop another and another , and another , and fluid dynamics 101 .
the ripples reinforce each other in geometric progression .
hm , the whole bigger than the sum of the parts .
then we' il have five 200 megaton explosions ...
lnstead of one big bang .
so , we hot wire the nukes .
yes .
and as one does , we seed them through the core ... at locations that have to be accurate to the inch .
we detonate them in a sequence that has to be accurate to the millisecond ... then we outrun the biggest nuclear shock wave in history .
right .
yeah .
i mean , that should be fairly simple .
destiny now should be diverting to the central .
final calibration on both transmission systems ...
come on .
cut the ... cut the rouge .
the red wire above the circuit .
okay .
okay .
no , no , wait , hold it !
i' m sorry , cut it below .
please ...
extensions a , b.
here we go .
f , check .
lncrease power to reactors ten through 15
we' re almost there , folks .
okay , guys we' re closing on the inner core .
the nukes are ready .
timers are on .
great .
let' s start dropping them .
no .
the bombs are not built for these pressures .
that' s why they were in that pod .
lf you send them out now ... out of that casing , they' il be crushed instantly .
i' m assuming we have a plan d.
plan d is virgil' s compartments .
we put a nuke in each section of virgil , and then eject the individual sections one at a time .
they should stay intact long enough for the nuke to go off .
oh ...
what ?
virgil' s not designed to eject undamaged compartments .
okay , these are the ejection mechanisms holding each compartment in place .
they' re all connected by one master hydraulic gear .
kind of like keys on a key ring .
what we have to do , we have to unlock the piston .
that will release the compartments so the bombs can be jettisoned .
where' s the master gear ?
ln the crawl space we used to get out earlier .
well , what the hell is it doing there ?
i built the ship in three damn months .
i didn' t think i' d be intentionally sabotaging it .
i' m sorry !
so one of us has to go in there .
correct .
lnto the crawl space that has core fluid at 9, 000 degrees .
yes .
can you flush it with liquid nitrogen ?
we don' t have enough at this point .
9, 000 degrees .
and our suits are built to withstand ... ?
half that , probably .
right .
half that .
so what you' re saying is whoever goes into that crawl space , is not coming back .
hmm .
together .
yes , thank you .
wait .
on three .
okay .
one ... two ... three .
huh .
well , i better go on , get myself ready .
no , braz , wait .
no , braz , no wait .
excuse me .
just a moment , may i see that ?
no .
may l ?
may l ?
yes .
thank you .
magic .
i mean , braz , three straws of equal length .
i mean , this is childish .
let' s do it again .
no , we will not do it again .
i thought you' d be happy .
no .
not at the expense of you making us look like fools .
he' s right .
why do you get dibs on being the hero ?
because it' s my damn ship .
oh , that makes perfect sense .
look , for 20 years , i' ve done nothing but virgil .
20 years .
virgii belongs to me , and i will not let her fail .
i will not .
now if you want to know what' s worth dying for this ship .
building it instead of imagining it .
lf virgii needs more blood , it will be my blood .
now i am going to go and get ready .
good to go .
beck .
josh .
it' s a hell of a boat you built , braz .
i am really proud to have known you guys .
thank you .
braz .
edward .
yes , conrad ?
you' re right .
it is your ship .
but i wish to god it had been ours .
the chamber' s sealed , beck .
ready .
open the hatch .
hang on , braz .
come on , hang on .
manual override is complete !
braz , we can still get you out of there .
no ... start ... start the impeller .
no .
we got a job to do .
let' s do it .
let' s go .
magnetic shielding systems are up .
magnetic shielding systems are up .
power level' s 85 % .
lncrease power to reactor 10 .
all personnel should be clear .
oh , god !
oh , i' m sorry .
okay , she' s down .
approaching the first drop off point .
we got to be accurate to the second here , boys .
and drop in three five seconds .
and ... timer on .
pull it .
clear ... and ... ejecting .
all right .
lnitiate firing sequence .
sir ...
it' s our last shot , stick .
damn you .
damn me ?
too late .
ten , nine , eight ...
what' s that ?
gotcha ! ... four , three , two ...
whoa , whoa , whoa !
someone' s diverted our energy .
where the hell' s it gone ? !
it looks like ...
coney lsland .
your kung fu is not strong .
well , how long will it take to get it back online ?
well , then get to it !
oh , hey , general .
ls there something i can do for you ?
timer on .
clear ... ejecting .
ejecting .
pull it .
all right .
let' s go throw our last little 200 megaton stone in the pond .
i always wanted to make a splash in nuclear physics .
you know , that energy propagation stuff you were talking about ...
oh , that was high school physics .
yeah , it' s not exactly ...
i just took the wavelengths from the core fluid off the mrl readings .
yeah , and multiplied by 800 ... 600 .
surely you compensated for the mrl bias .
we got to reset the timers !
reset the timers !
no !
it just won' t work .
it' s not the timers !
this is not enough !
what' s not enough ?
the last bomb is not enough .
to complete the wave form .
yeah .
no .
the last bomb has to be 30 % larger .
that' s six or seven pounds of plutonium .
where are we going to get six or seven pounds of plutonium ?
guys , we got hit by an energy flare .
i can' t keep us on course .
ejecting compartment in 50 seconds .
no , beck !
no , wait !
no !
push it !
you push it !
come on , guys , i can' t hear you .
it' s got my shoulder !
push !
guys !
clear !
clear the compartment !
what are you doing ?
i think the flare has knocked the coms out .
i can' t get it , josh .
i can' t get it .
go ...
i can' t .
okay .
i' m sorry .
i' m sorry .
can you hear me ?
i' m correcting course .
now !
zimsky !
no !
push it !
ejecting compartment in ten seconds .
can you hear me ?
josh , go !
go !
go !
get out !
get out !
now !
get out !
now !
get out !
go !
josh .
for the last bomb , to make it larger ... use the fuel rods from the react ...
ejecting .
i got to get ...
i got to ...
beck .
beck , can you hear me ?
beck , if you have any better ideas , you tell me now .
we' ve only got three minutes to eject this one .
beck !
come on , guys .
i can' t hear you .
beck .
josh , come on .
are you okay ?
are you okay ?
will you take my gloves off ?
oh , my god .
please .
i had to build the blast .
i' m sorry .
hold on , let me get ...
no .
stay here for one second .
i was trying to call you .
i know the coms were down .
right .
i know what you did .
we don' t have enough energy ...
i know . ... to get back .
you did good .
i would' ve done the same thing .
where' s zimsky ?
come here .
you did good .
you did good .
one minute to the first detonation .
and 12 until the blast hits us .
i was hoping we' d suffocate to death first .
beck .
beck , beck .
what could you do if i got you enough power to fire the impeller ?
maybe not the laser but the impeller .
what ?
from where ?
the heat of the core .
it' s 9, 000 degrees .
unobtainium converts heat to energy .
so this whole damn ship is like a big , old solar panel .
come on , i need your help .
number two' s going !
come on , come on .
for here in the great infinite unknowable ... man can come to know the most important thing of all : himself .
he can understand ...
what the fuck am i doing ?
we' ve got full rotation !
it' s turning !
all right !
come on , beck , where is it ?
come on .
come on , hurry up .
ls that the last one ?
yeah .
give it a couple seconds .
it worked !
get ready to pull a few g' s .
420 knots .
now , this is more like it .
440 .
so , rat , what' s the center of this quake ?
it' s everywhere !
it' s one giant shock wave !
the planet' s healing itself .
at this speed , we' re going to be home in a third of the time .
as long as we can surf these magma flows , we' il be okay .
let' s just pray we don' t run into any dead ends , or we' re going to miss those lasers .
okay , navigator , which way ?
we' ve got greater fluid density on the left .
go with the flow .
uh huh .
bill , where are they headed ?
looks like she found a space between some tectonic plates somewhere near hawaii .
josh ...
yeah ?
they' re closing in on us too fast .
i don' t know if i can ...
hey , you got it .
um ... w we lost them , stick , and i ...
where' d our power go ?
well , we' re powered by the heat .
it' s stone cold down here .
well ...
look on the bright side .
at least we' re not going to boil to death .
you always look on the bright side ?
always .
we' ve got no communications , we' re probably 800 feet down , but we might as well be 800 miles .
we' re in an unobtainium cigar tube with the sonar signature of a rock .
we' ve got just enough power to make the ultrasonics burp , but no one' s listening on those frequencies anyway , and ... nobody even knows we' re alive .
okay .
give me a minute on this one .
this is hopeless .
come on , general , we' ve got to be getting close .
we can' t ...
mr. rat , even if they were still alive , there' s no way they could contact us .
bridge .
skipper , combat relays that our sub has something on the sonar .
where do they think ?
bill , put it up on the hydrophone .
whales , sir .
they' re a long way off their usual path , but that' s not uncommon since that , uh ... what are they calling it ?
orbital wobble ?
yeah , that' s what they call it .
well , thank you very much , captain , but i think we' re done here .
general .
j. o. , this is the captain .
stand down from sar operations .
it' s whales !
it' s whales !
hey !
general !
stick !
it' s whales !
the ultrasonics !
they' re singing to them !
you gotta find the whales !
alpha x ray , this is november echo six one zero .
i' m changing ...
hold on , i' m seeing those whales now .
whoa !
okay , ball' s in the water .
this is neat .
those whales are circling something .
hold on , hold on .
we have a strong echo here .
depth , 800 feet .
there there' s something down there .
there' s definitely something down there .
i told you pulsing the ultrasonics would work .
do you ever get tired of being right ?
yes .
so what' s next for you ?
a shower .
then back to nasa , i guess .
you ?
deep dish pepperoni pizza , green peppers , onions , extra mushrooms then a shower and then back to the classroom .
nasa could use a few good men , you know .
yeah .
unfortunately , so could my freshmen geophysics students .
you know what makes me really , really angry ?
you know what makes me really , really angry ?
bob , serge , braz , zimsky ... no one' s going to ever know what they did or why they died .
unless ... it all got out somehow .
that' s unthinkable .
yeah .
okay , here we go .
sweet .
it is now emerging that the world owes its survival to the heroism of six remarkable individuals
shuttle commander robert lverson , ...
this extraordinary craft ...
french scientist , dr. serge ... was captained by nasa astronaut dr. bob lverson .
edward brazzleton is a name so ...
dr. conrad zimsky will be best remembered ...
on capitol hill today , everyone' s asking the same question
what is project destiny ?
destiny , meet world .
world , meet destiny .
look at the red , red changes in the sky
look at the separation in the borderline
but don' t look at evetything here inside
here inside
and be afraid , afraid to speak your mind
it took a moment before i lost myself in here
it took a moment and i could not be found
again and again and again and again
i see your face in evetything
it took a moment the moment it could not be found
what' s with the fascination with the echelon ?
what' s with the constant questions
that you have this time ?
what' s with this circumstantial consequence ?
consequence
find oversight before this night will ever rise again
it' s all you' ve got inside your head
you better get up and leave instead
it took a moment before i lost myself in here
it took a moment and i could not be found
again and again and again and again
i see your face in evetything
it took a moment the moment it could not be found
found
to find ourselves lost here within
we need good reasons why
so we take this bridge
with the others that will thrive in the great divide
look at the red , red changes in the sky .
