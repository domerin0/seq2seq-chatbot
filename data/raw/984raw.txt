could you line me up in the back ?
that' s gon ' run you about $13 .
thirteen dollars ?

her moms had just gone to church .
and we had the place all to ourself .
so you know , we got to kissin ' , lickin ' , slobbin ' .
you know , doin ' the wild thing .
when we got up there , it was like heaven .
better than my wildest fantasies .
well , apparently , her moms must have forgot her purse or somethin ' ,
' cause she came back home .
i guess she could smell sex in the air .
i got a surprise for you .
and that' s when things really got freaky .
come on .
before i knew it the door burst open ...
