devine .

charles lindbergh .
lucky lindy or the lone eagle as he was called .
is our subject today because he was ... the first man to ... what ?
megan ?
fly over the atlantic ?
very good .
first man to fly solo .
nonstop from new york city to paris .
and that was 1927 .
an astonishing accomplishment .
which brings us to today' s assignment .
let' s see which of you can navigate .
or fly if you will .
from our home base to our hero' s website here ... in the fewest number of links .
all right ?
and you' re off .
well .
that' s very clever .
dimitri .
megan .
might i have a word with you ?
save me a seat .
okay ?
okay .
come to my office .
take a seat .
now .
megan .
you know i understand ... the particular pressures of your life .
your father being who he is .
and the enormous expectations ... all adds up to rather a lot .
doesn' t it ?
yes .
sir .
hmm .
but .
none of that excuses ...
your breaking the honor code .
what ?
i know all about you and dimitri .
megan .
we don' t tolerate cheating .
now do we ?
cheating ?
mr. soneji .
there' s been a mistake .
we only pass notes .
you know .
jokes and stuff .
megan .
before you go any further .
you best have a look at that .
mr. soneji ?
yes ?
this essay .
it isn' t mine .
beg your pardon ?
what do you mean ?
oh .
my .
oh .
dear girl .
i' m ...
oh .
dear .
dear .
gary , why is the door locked ?
oh .
my god .
what happened ?
she' s collapsed .
she' s collapsed .
i tell you what .

i' il get some help .
okay .
megan ?
hey , sweetheart , can you hear me ?
megan ?
hey .
jezzie .
hi .
kila .
hey .
hannah .
where' s megan ?
she' s with mr. soneji .
control .
i' m en route to soneji' s classroom .
i' m sure it' s just a meeting that went long .
well .
it' s against procedure .
mr. soneji should know better .
his office .
mr. soneji .
secret service .
open up .
mr. soneji ?
do you have a key ?
i' m sorry .
there seems to be something stuck in here .
stand back .
control .
shut down .
stop all vehicles .
lock on soneji and rose .
so , how many of these boats you have to make before you become shipshape ?
i have never seen a man work so hard at looking busy .
alex .
it' s been eight months .
hmm ?
it' s time you forgave yourself .
vickie .
you know that forgiving yourself is the one thing a person cannot do .
... choose to make contact .
we are currently trying to put the pieces together as to how and why ... this man would murder a teacher and kidnap a young student .
here' s a photograph of the missing student .
megan ann rose is 12 years old .
blond hair with hazel eyes .
she' s 3' 5" tall and weighs about 52 pounds .
she was last seen inside the school with the suspect around noon today .
we havejust received information ... that senior f. b. i. and secret service officials ... have arrived at the family home of senator rose .
we will go there live as soon as we have our satellite feed .
technicians are setting up extra telephone lines in the rose home , all in preparation should the kidnapper ...
mom ... please .
i just wanna go home .
the f. b. i. and police are on the lookout for this man .
gary soneji .
this is a recent photograph ...
we only know that he has ... disappeared with the 12 year old daughter of senator hank rose .
how and why is on the minds ...
police are trying to find out who this man really is , his motives for killing teacher amy masterson ...
we go back live to join ... reporter alison peretsky , who has been at the scene ... since law enforcement officials arrived .
yeah ?
mom ... please .
i wanna go home .
hello ?
you tuned into me .
dr. cross ?
sounds like alison peretsky at wnkw action news .
gary soneji ?
that' il do for now .
how' d you get this number ?
unlisted numbers ?
come on .
alex .
there' s no such thing .
it' s all out there in the air .
you just have to know how to grab it .
hey .
how do you feel about my kidnapping being bigger news ... than your little tragedy with jim gelway ?
you ought to give an interview about what happened that night .
you know what they say about sharing your pain .
it' s very cathartic .
thanks .
but i' m doing okay .
that' s good to hear .
very good .
i thought for a while there you wouldn' t be able to get ... your act back together .
and that would be a great shame .
i' ve been planning for a long .
long time to involve you ... in the fate of our little miss muffet .
megan .
do you have trouble saying her name ?
first name rapport ?
hostage negotiations 101 ?
now come on .
alex .
you can do better than that .
can' t you ?
you think you' re gonna dissect me in three blinks of an eye ?
i' m not that easy .
but with a little patience and a little help .
you just might profile me to a " t.
what makes you think i' m interested ?
they say that when i die .
the case will die .
they say it' il be like a book i close .
but the book .
it will never close .
very poetic .
what the hell is it ?
i' ve left something for your visit with the roses tonight .
you' il find it in your cold .
corrugated mailbox .
time to get back to work .
dr. cross .
indistinct ]
megan .
do you have trouble saying the name ?
sorry .
detective .
this is a federal case .
i' ve been invited .
we have a detective who may have evidence pertinent to the case .
what should we do about it ?
alex ?
special agent craig .
well .
i' il be .
dare i ask ?
in my mailbox .
anything else ?
that' il get you inside .
terry .
get this to macarthur .
who' s in charge ?
ollie macarthur .
pedigree " feebie .
made his bones busting wackos in the seattle office .
soneji .
clean ?
clean ?
squeaky .
fibers look generic .
fingerprints .
nada .
the whole school' s a goddamn forensic vacuum .
all he left us was one very neatly strangled teacher .
heads are gonna roll with the secret service .
oh .
jezzie flannigan .
alex cross .
agent flannigan was in charge of the secret service detail at cathedral .
dr. cross .
agent flannigan .
i' ve read your books on profiling .
obviously .
not close enough .
but ...
obviously .
not close enough .
but ...
kyle , this shoe was i. d. ' d by the roses .
it' s megars .
dr. alex cross .
special agent in charge ...
oliver macarthur .
how do you do .
sir .
alex .
i' il catch you later .
forensics .
yes .
sir .
senator and mrs. rose are through here .
before we talk to them .
you any idea why soneji is involving you ?
not at all .
this way .
uh .
excuse me .
shouldn' t agent flannigan be in the room with us ?
not a good idea .
miss flannigan is not welcome .
but she' s a material witness .
she failed the roses .
and she failed the service .
i think agent macarthur has a point .
no .
he' s missing the point .
you saw soneji every day .
five days a week .
for how long ?
two years .
you have no idea how much you know about this case .
agent flannigan .
they say that when i die .
the case will die .
they say it' il be like a book i close .
but the book , it will never close .
very poetic .
what the hell is it ?
i' ve left you something for your visit ... with the roses tonight .
you' il find it in your cold , corrugated mailbox .
well .
for what it' s won' th .
that' s soneji .
his speech patterrs the same .
is he .
um ...
are we dealing with a sex maniac ?
someone who might , you know ...
no .
sir .
this man has no such interest in your daughter .
she' s merely a means to an end .
what do you mean ?
i see no standard procedure in anything he' s done .
i disagree .
this is a professional kidnapping .
it' s going to be about money .
which is good .
but you' re saying it isn' t about money .
i think he wants to draw this out .
from what he said , whatever his motives ... it' s very unusual .
what did he mean about the book ?
that it will never close ?
i honestly don' t know .
well .
i think i do .
let me tell you what this gary soneji is up to .
the last thing he wants is good crisis management .
what he wants is to confuse .
rancor .
mixed signals , disorientation , those are his tools .
so .
he calls a local cop .
a damaged cop , shouldering some heavy baggage .
he' s using dr. cross as his messenger ...
excuse me .
the man that kidnapped our daughter didn' t call you .
so your agenda is what ?
to insult the man he did call ?
mrs. rose .
i never intended ...
no , you wait a second .
a madman has our daughter , and for some reason he contacted this man .
do you know why ?
no .
ma' am .
not yet .
hello .
you okay ?
you .
uh ... got any tips for helpless situations ?
well .
you could smoke a can' ton a day .
or you could bounce back .
yeah .
well .
i don' t see anywhere to bounce to .
like to get out of here ?
can i ask you something ?
sure .
what did macarthur mean when he referred to you as damaged ?
last summer .
i let a sting operation get out of control .
my partner was killed .
hello .
megan .
how are you ?
coming to see you .
do you recognize my voice ?
it' s me .
mr. soneji .
hmm ?
i brought you that .
a lovely cup of tea with honey .
i know your throat is sore .
it' il make you feel better .
there you go .
it' s all right .
you have nothing to be scared of .
megan .
i' m not scared .
good .
but you' re wondering what' s going on .
i know what' s going on .
you' re a kidnapper .
and you' re a sick weirdo .
megan .
you' re the most opinionated girl in my class .
think you got that from your mom ?
i wanna go home .
you will .
just promise me you' re going to behave yourself .
okay ?
so .
now listen .
if you need to use the bathroom or anything .
just press that .
okay ?
i wanna go home !
now !
i brought you some fresh clothes .
please !
mr. soneji .
please !
this is a fine gun .
it' s turkish .
handmade .
1924 .
that is nice .
my daddy won it in a game of poker .
aces and eights .
dead mars hand .
that' s about as much as i know about my father .
have a seat .
do you know of any relationship between amy masterson and soneji ?
amy ?
no way .
why do you ask ?
he strangled her .
it' s an act of passion .
it' s a demonstration of will .
a message .
take me seriously .
what do you see ?
dr. cross ...
alex .
alex .
womars intuition .
third eye .
sixth sense ... whatever it is .
i don' t have it .
sure you do .
you just don' t look at it right .
every face has two aspects .
now try looking at it down the middle .
one side at a time .
would you say this man was confident ?
yeah .
narcissistic ?
l i wouldn' t know .
ever see any flashes of hatred ?
no .
no .
no !
anger ?
hostility ?
look .
everything about him was right .
he was always patient .
he was pleasant .
he had a sense of humor .
i mean .
he was the perfect teacher .
what do you see ?
i see ...
no .
i mean about me .
what do you see about me ?
that' s why you' re here .
isn' t it ?
size me up .
evaluate your primary material witness ?
i see that you' re about to start an argument .
i need to help get her back .
what makes you think i want a partner ?
you don' t .
i can understand that .
that' s right .
no .
you can' t .
can i tell you why i don' t care ?
shoot .
look .
when i was assigned to cathedral .
it was a job i didn' t want .
it' s a far cry from working rope lines or flying air force one .
but i have been there for three years .
i have been responsible for megan for three years .
and that little girl means more to me than even a partner .
can you understand that ?
i suppose so .
even if i say no .
you' il probably follow me around wherever i go .
so .
if it' s a choice between having you as a partner ... or as a stalker .
i guess i' il take my chances with a partner .
thank you .
the student drop off is there .
that' s my morning post .
students sign in .
cameras are there .
there .
there and there .
motions sensors all around the periphery .
foolproof way to keep the kooks out .
exactly .
we were always looking in the wrong direction .
which door did he go out ?
uh .
that one there .
it' s a straight shot to his parking space .
let' s go in .
his classroom .
mm hmm .
he was teaching how everything on the internet is connected .
alex .
you got a sec ?
sure .
listen .
i think turf wars are a total waste of time .
if i was out of line last night .
i apologize .
don' t .
i' ve been there .
anything you need .
let me know .
sure .
mac .
dr. cross , you might want to see this .
this was megars desk ?
yeah .
what are you doing ?
scoping glfs .
graphic interchange formats .
they' re all stego encrypted .
somewhere among the billions of zeros and ones making this image ...
is a string of text .
i know about this .
it' s the cutting edge method of passing notes in class .
it' s driving the teachers nuts .
how long before you can access it ?
try never .
you don' t crack stego without a password .
would you take me to his office ?
oh .
when you find soneji .
ask him for the password .
he planted a monitoring virus on the girl' s hard drive .
every keystroke megan hit .
soneji was recording it .
good move .
jezz .
angling for a position with the d. c. p. d. i like that .
dr. cross .
agent ben devine .
agent devine is security systems supervisor .
well .
for now .
we' re going to be thrown to the wolves .
as soon as they find megan rose dead in a ditch .
now what makes you so sure that' s what' s going to happen ?
me getting fired or the girl in a ditch ?
sorry .
i' m having a pessimistic day .
tell me .
soneji .
did he ... did he ever show any interest in what you do ?
how you do it ?
the man never talked to me .
i never talked to him .
well .
thanks for your time .
hello .
what ?
what do you think that is ?
an empty frame .
mm hmm .
otherwise known as ...
a missing picture .
you onto something ?
our missing picture .
mm hmm .
our mr. soneji has a sense of humor .
he didn' t just kidnap a little girl .
he turned it into a game .
okay .
let' s see what you know .
mr. lindbergh .
my .
my .
what do you got ?
dr. cross isn' t in cyberspace anymore .
you' re at a live site .
iooking through a video camera .
those arrows down there move it .
where are we ?
i would guess we' re in soneji' s home .
now we' re supposed to find out where that is .
oliver macarthur' s office .
yeah .
it' s me .
hold on .
how about the files ?

not until we get the go ahead .
his surveillance was better than ours .
he' s been at this for years .
imagine the patience , the dedication .
you sound like an admirer .
well .
he' s ... he' s like a spider .
and i happen to like spiders .
he had an elaborate setup here , boss .
want to see how he stayed clean at school ?
it laminates a plastic veneer over your hands .
look at this .
it' s foam rubber .
looks like he was wearing prosthetic appliances .
i understand the secret service are being cautious tonight .
there is speculation that a full investigation is under way into ...
yes , kevin , one of the secret service agents ...
evening .
what' s the problem ?

and before the hood was pulled over his head .
he bragged to his executioner . " ' they think that when i die .
the case will die . " ' they think it will be like a book i close .
' but the book .
it will never close . " '
soneji was quoting the final words of richard bruno hauptman .
i' m sorry .
i don' t follow .
1932 .
the infant son of charles lindbergh .
america' s greatest hero .
was kidnapped .
when bruno hauptman was arrested , what followed became known as ...
the crime of the century .
i believe that soneji wants to do the same thing .
you think we' re dealing with a copycat .
something like that .
dr. cross ... what does he want from you ?
he' s brought me in and left this trail ... because he wants me to make sure that he' s properly appreciated .
but in order for him to achieve this ... he has to kill megan .
no .
no .
not necessarily .
the death of the lindbergh baby was accidental .
nevertheless .
it' s critical that we pull his strings .
the more we make him a living legend .
the more likely he is to keep megan alive .
dr. cross , you' ve been brought into this case , what can you tell us about gary soneji ?
i can tell you that soneji is very determined .
obviously highly capable and we consider him a serious adversary .
what about megan rose ?
megan rose is gary soneji' s ace .
as long as he has her , he' s in control .
sir , would you assign as many agents to this case ... if she wasrt a senator' s daughter ?
the size of our task force is a reflection ... of who gary soneji is .
not megan rose .
mr. soneji .
you can parse the words if you' d like ...
hello ?
i need to go to the bathroom .
all right .
be right there .

you promised me you were going to behave yourself .
because of you .
what you' ve done .
that man is dead .
now ... promise me .
promise me you' re going to be a good little girl .
okay ?
all right ?
say .
yes .
mr. soneji .
say .
yes .
mr. soneji .
y yes .
mr. soneji .
okay .
let' s go have that cup of tea .
i' d say eight hours .
about 9 : 00 a . m .
slugs are large caliber .
shots hit him here .
here .
kill shot tapped him crown of the head .
this here is thomas mathias .
he found all this .
this way .
she' s not in the water .
jezzie .
soneji still has her .
there' s no way of knowing that .
think about it .
megan is precious cargo .
soneji' s not gonna let some twist of fate bring her harm .
right ?
but why megan ?
why her ?
come on .
where are you going ?
back to the city .
we' il talk in the car .
you asked .
why megan ?
why megan ?
who is senator hank rose ?
he' s ...
nobody .
most people don' t even know who he is .
never heard of him .
couldrt pick him out of a lineup .
this is front page news now .
where will it be in two months ?
ayear ?
oblivion .
know why ?
because senator hank rose is no charles lindbergh .
well .
okay .
then .
who is ?
ah .
there' s the troublesome question .
come on .
jezzie .
two years .
five days a week .
you know soneji .
who' s a bigger fish than megan rose ?
da .
mm hmm .
dr. cross .
agent flannigan .
we appreciate your concern .
but .
uh .
dimitri' s fine .
our security services are more than capable ... of protecting the son of the russian president .
can we at least talk to him ?
nothing would please us more than to be of help .
but speaking to dimitri right now would be inappropriate .
thanks for your time .
what ?
well .
macarthur' s dragnetting the bay .
right ?
and .
i mean .
he' s not really missing us .
so i was thinking maybe we could just stick around and .
you know .
scope out the place a bit .
agent flannigan .
are you ... are you suggesting a stakeout here ?
yeah .
you know .
stale coffee .
some doughnuts .
no .
no .
that' s a first class stakeout .
agent flannigan .
what you' re talking about here would be no frills .
you' d only get to think about stale coffee and doughnuts .
well .
i can handle it if you can .
i get the feeling you' ve done this a lot .
oh .
yeah .
every chance i get .
especially when it' s cold and wet .
no parking here .
we' re on the clock .
officer .
everything okay ?
everything is all right .
what' s the problem ?
go ahead .
jezzie .
what ?
have one .
thank you .
alex .
that' s dimitri .
jezzie .
it' s him .
it' s him !
soneji , hold it right there !
jezzie .
shoot the tires !
jezzie !
jezzie !
police !
don' t shoot !
don' t shoot !
jezzie !
jezzie .
you' re gonna get megan back .
right ?
yes .
we are .
i promise .
use this to get mr. soneji .
i will .
thank you .
you talk to hal .
i want you to bring him up to speed .
well done .
guys .
avert an international crisis and paint soneji into a corner .
not bad for a night' s work .
soneji ditched a patrol car near reno park .
hijacked a tan sierra .
one bullet in the driver' s head .
last seen heading toward route 50 .
annapolis .
i knew it .
seventy five thousand boats .
other marinas ?
we' re here .
dead fisherman here .
these .
all the marinas .
all locked down .
patrol boats in each of them .
all right .
listen up .
we gotta move fast .
roadblock route 50 and triple the surveillance in the harbors .
i want two choppers on the pad in five minutes .
let' s go !
what' s wrong ?
i blew it .
that' s what' s wrong .
i had a shot right before he hit the hydrant .
but instead of pulling the trigger .
i was thinking .
i was thinking .
yeah .
you were thinking .
about your shot going astray ... and blowing soneji' s head off .
in which case ...
we would never find megan .
i know that .
well .
then .
don' t beat yourself up for being prudent .
you don' t get it .
i was trained to shoot first and think later .
jezzie .
for heavers sake .
if you hadrt convinced me to stay there .
soneji would have two victims instead of one .
plus we' d have an international incident on our hands .

you ready ?
all right .
now .
throw !
we can neither confirm nor deny that gary soneji ... was involved in the incident on the mta train this morning .
we' ve heard that a ransom was paid .
comment ?
i can' t comment on any of that .
what about megan rose ?
i' m not going to go into any details at this time .
what about soneji' s state of mind ?
i' m not going to comment on his mental stability .
you can draw your own conclusions .
now , senator rose has agreed to make a statement ,
so ?
the file on soneji .
is it still on your kitchen table ?
yeah .
why ?
i' m gonna have another look at it .
this business about the diamonds .
money .
i didn' t see it coming .
i am grateful that the f. b. i. is here .
with the objective expertise to find out where my daughter is .
secondly , i now ...
this is worse than killing time .
yeah .
but you' d be amazed at how often the small .
neglected things ... become the most important .
i just got the feeling we' re missing something .
maybe i' m in the wrong line of work .
maybe i should take on something less challenging .
you do what you are .
jezzie .
you mean .
you are what you do .
no .
i mean .
you do what you are .
you' re born with a gift .
if not that .
then you get good at something along the way .
and what you' re good at .
you don' t take for granted .
you don' t betray it .
what if you do betray your gift ?
then .
you betray yourself .
that' s a sad thing .
who is it ?
police .
gary soneji .
hi .
alex .
now .
right hand .
thumb and forefinger .
just give me the gun .
alex .
you can' t shoot me .
you' il never find megan .
sit down .
alex .
i' m i' m a little concerned .
alex .
i' m a little ...
i' m a little worried that you ... you don' t really care to understand me anymore ; that you won' t paint an accurate portrait .
and i need you to convince me that i' m wrong .
in order to do that .
we' re going to have to talk about megan rose .
no .
no bargaining .
alex .
no cheap interrogation techniques .
it' s transparent .
and it' s clumsy .
this is between me and you .
i want you to see .
i want you to look inside here and tell me what the fuck you see !
i' m a gift to you , alex .
i' m a gift to you .
and you are beyond ... pitiful if you cannot understand that .
i' m living proof that a mind ... the mind is a terrible thing .
i see you' ve got your sense of humor back .
yeah .
i wondered what happened to it during the ransom drop .
the ransom drop .
that was a well earned 12 million .
twelve million .
senator rose says he can pull strings .
he says he can fix it so you keep the 12 million and walk .
all you have to do is return the child .
where is megan ?
where' s megan ?
where is megan ?
where' s megan ?
where is megan ?
where is megan ?
she' s trapped on my boat .
alex .
isn' t that right ?
or maybe she' s stuck in a warehouse somewhere or floating in a river .
swinging from the end of a rope .
buried alive .
i envy her .
what would life had been like with parents like that ?
come on , gary , blaming your parents for what you are ?
i' m not blaming them , alex .
they' ve been punished already .
i burned down the house while they slept .
i was 15 years old .
was it what you expected ?
not really .
it was a new experience .
what .
killing ?
no .
being in the newspapers .
so , in your opinion , doctor , were my actions triggered by nature ... or nurture ?
if you want me to be brutally honest ...
i think you just have a morbid desire to burn in hell .
we' re done for today .
i' m taking her with me .
you' re not taking her anywhere .
i' il send her back to you .
you just tell me which piece you want first .
aah !
ow !
oh , shit !
damn it .
alex !
oh .
my god .
what have you done ?
what have you d done ?
residents of this normally quiet suburb are still in shock ... as news of the shooting of gary soneji .
america' s most wanted man .
filtered through their community .
apparently , soneji had attempted to confront , or even harm ... members of the kidnapping task force hunting him .
so .
he came after jezzie as payback for dimitri .
ostensibly .
yeah .
that' s how you want it on record ?
yeah .
for now .
here they come .
dr. cross .
tell me you have at least an idea where my little girl is .
i' m sorry .
sir .
i can' t .
you kill the one man who has the answers .
and you' re telling me you haven' t a clue .
not one clue ?
the man walked in the fucking room .
and you shot him .
senator ... standing in his shoes .
i' d have done the same thing .
sir .
that' s your job .
not his .
he' s supposed to find my little girl .
not shoot the man who knows where she is .
senator .
it' s not over .
the book is not closed .
alex ... thank you for saving my life .
good bye .
jezzie .
wanna hear something funny .
mac ?
sure .
cheer me up .
i congratulated soneji on scoring $ 12 million .
you mean ten million .
exactly .
he had no idea what i was talking about .
i know you .
you work at my school .
eat your food .
megan .
alex .
where is this going ?
we' ve been through these tapes backwards and forwards .
i can' t see how this is helping us find megan .
you know what i see , mac ?
someone was onto soneji long before we ever heard of him .
look at this .
what do you see ?
agent devine hauling ass out to the front gate .
mac .
he could have shut this whole place down from right there .
now .
you wanna tell me why he didn' t ?
good god .
devine was in on it with him .
then .
when soneji hit the embassy .
he pulled a double cross .
he ran his own ransom .
no .
soneji was a loner .
an accomplice would have been beneath him .
i' il tell you what happened .
soneji was hoodwinked .
and so were we .
details are still emerging .
the manunt that began over a week ago in the natiors capitol ...
came to a violent end yesterday , [ clattering ]
with the death of kidnapper , gary soneji .
don' t move .
turn around .
hands on the wall .
feet apart .
hi .
jez .
where' d you come from ?
you know something .
devine .
you' re pretty stupid .
your car in the driveway .
tv so loud .
you wouldn' t be able to hear a swat team come in .
what are you doing ...
shut up !
where' s megan ?
she' s in the barn .
she was so doped up .
i don' t think she knew i took her off the boat .
she' s still alive ?
you were supposed to dump her in the river ...
after you got the diamonds .
yeah .
well .
maybe killing a kid is something i' m not prepared to do on my own .
anyway .
today .
tomorrow .
it' s still gonna look like soneji killed her .
she can' t die after soneji .
you idiot .
it doesn' t make any difference .
they' re never gonna find the body .
okay .
i' il go do it now .
will that make you happy ?
yeah .
it would .
wait !
can i see them ?
hey .
do you realize we spent an entire year ... following soneji' s every move ?
i think we deserve these .
that beats the hell out of a secret service pension .
huh ?
profiling the profiler .
kidnap from the kidnapper .
that' s brilliant .
you are a genius .
jez .
genius has nothing to do with it .
i' m just good at what i do .
didrt hurt that everyone else involved was a complete half wit .
you think alex cross is a half wit ?
you really believe that he shot soneji to save my life ?
cross pulled the trigger because he knew soneji didn' t have megan .
what are you saying ?
i' m saying that sooner or later .
he' s gonna figure it out .
he already knows soneji didn' t run the ransom .
he' s onto us already .
isn' t he ?
no .
he' s not onto us .
but i think he' s onto you .
it' s turkish .
my daddy won it in a game of poker .
that' s about as much as i know about my father .
megan ?
megan .
it' s me .
honey .
jezzie ?
jezzie ?
jezzie .
jezzie .
i' m in here !
jezzie !
open up .
honey .
i' m gonna take you home .
it' s all over .
yeah .

just hold on a second .
jezzie ?
yeah .
honey .
what happened to that other guy ?
he' s dead .
megan .
you' re safe now .
open up .
jezzie ?
yeah , honey .
why isn' t there anyone else with you ?
megan .
it' s me .
don' t be scared of me .
open the door .
megan , i' m gonna ask you one more time to open the door .
right now .
open the door !
megan , open the door for me .
listen to me !
open the door !
megan .
open the fucking door !
open it , bitch !
stop it !
no !
stop it !
that was very clever .
megan .
shh .
shh .
shh .
jezzie ?
it' s over .
drop the gun .
alex ... how how did you .
um ...
aces and eights .
jezzie .
plus , your timing was a little off .
i watched the tapes .
you and devine could have stopped soneji at the school .
just like you could have stopped him at the russian embassy .
but you had a different agenda .
you know something .
alex ?
when you said .
you do what you are .
you were right .
i' m living proof .
put the gun down .
jezzie .
would you kill another partner ?
you' re not my partner .
are you all right ?
you' re a very brave girl .
megan .
who are you ?
i' m a policeman .
my name is alex cross .
i' m a friend of your parents .
can you take me to them ?
nothing would give me greater pleasure .
could you ...
ah .

brown bag .
close into one click .

what is it about big hair that turns guys on anyway ?
bad taste ?

charles lindbergh .
lucky lindy or the lone eagle as he was called .
is our subject today because he was ... the first man to ... what ?
megan ?
fly over the atlantic ?
very good .
first man to fly solo .
nonstop from new york city to paris .
and that was 1927 .
an astonishing accomplishment .
which brings us to today' s assignment .
let' s see which of you can navigate .
or fly if you will .
from our home base to our hero' s website here ... in the fewest number of links .
all right ?
and you' re off .
well .
that' s very clever .
dimitri .
megan .
might i have a word with you ?
save me a seat .
okay ?
okay .
come to my office .
take a seat .
now .
megan .
you know i understand ... the particular pressures of your life .
your father being who he is .
and the enormous expectations ... all adds up to rather a lot .
doesn' t it ?
yes .
sir .
hmm .
but .
none of that excuses ...
your breaking the honor code .
what ?
i know all about you and dimitri .
megan .
we don' t tolerate cheating .
now do we ?
cheating ?
mr. soneji .
there' s been a mistake .
we only pass notes .
you know .
jokes and stuff .
megan .
before you go any further .
you best have a look at that .
mr. soneji ?
yes ?
this essay .
it isn' t mine .
beg your pardon ?
what do you mean ?
oh .
my .
oh .
dear girl .
i' m ...
oh .

megan ?
hey .
jezzie .
hi .
kila .
hey .
hannah .
where' s megan ?
she' s with mr. soneji .
control .
i' m en route to soneji' s classroom .
i' m sure it' s just a meeting that went long .
well .
it' s against procedure .
mr. soneji should know better .
his office .
mr. soneji .
secret service .
open up .
mr. soneji ?
do you have a key ?
i' m sorry .
there seems to be something stuck in here .
stand back .
control .
shut down .
stop all vehicles .
lock on soneji and rose .
so , how many of these boats you have to make before you become shipshape ?
i have never seen a man work so hard at looking busy .
alex .
it' s been eight months .
hmm ?
it' s time you forgave yourself .
vickie .
you know that forgiving yourself is the one thing a person cannot do .
... choose to make contact .
we are currently trying to put the pieces together as to how and why ... this man would murder a teacher and kidnap a young student .
here' s a photograph of the missing student .
megan ann rose is 12 years old .
blond hair with hazel eyes .
she' s 3' 5" tall and weighs about 52 pounds .
she was last seen inside the school with the suspect around noon today .
we havejust received information ... that senior f. b. i. and secret service officials ... have arrived at the family home of senator rose .
we will go there live as soon as we have our satellite feed .
technicians are setting up extra telephone lines in the rose home , all in preparation should the kidnapper ...
mom ... please .
i just wanna go home .
the f. b. i. and police are on the lookout for this man .
gary soneji .
this is a recent photograph ...
we only know that he has ... disappeared with the 12 year old daughter of senator hank rose .
how and why is on the minds ...
police are trying to find out who this man really is , his motives for killing teacher amy masterson ...
we go back live to join ... reporter alison peretsky , who has been at the scene ... since law enforcement officials arrived .
yeah ?
mom ... please .
i wanna go home .
hello ?
you tuned into me .
dr. cross ?
sounds like alison peretsky at wnkw action news .
gary soneji ?
that' il do for now .
how' d you get this number ?
unlisted numbers ?
come on .
alex .
there' s no such thing .
it' s all out there in the air .
you just have to know how to grab it .
hey .
how do you feel about my kidnapping being bigger news ... than your little tragedy with jim gelway ?
you ought to give an interview about what happened that night .
you know what they say about sharing your pain .
it' s very cathartic .
thanks .
but i' m doing okay .
that' s good to hear .
very good .
i thought for a while there you wouldn' t be able to get ... your act back together .
and that would be a great shame .
i' ve been planning for a long .
long time to involve you ... in the fate of our little miss muffet .
megan .
do you have trouble saying her name ?
first name rapport ?
hostage negotiations 101 ?
now come on .
alex .
you can do better than that .
can' t you ?
you think you' re gonna dissect me in three blinks of an eye ?
i' m not that easy .
but with a little patience and a little help .
you just might profile me to a " t.
what makes you think i' m interested ?
they say that when i die .
the case will die .
they say it' il be like a book i close .
but the book .
it will never close .
very poetic .
what the hell is it ?
i' ve left something for your visit with the roses tonight .
you' il find it in your cold .
corrugated mailbox .
time to get back to work .
dr. cross .
indistinct ]
megan .
do you have trouble saying the name ?
sorry .
detective .
this is a federal case .
i' ve been invited .
we have a detective who may have evidence pertinent to the case .
what should we do about it ?
alex ?
special agent craig .
well .
i' il be .
dare i ask ?
in my mailbox .
anything else ?
that' il get you inside .
terry .
get this to macarthur .
who' s in charge ?
ollie macarthur .
pedigree " feebie .
made his bones busting wackos in the seattle office .
soneji .
clean ?
clean ?
squeaky .
fibers look generic .
fingerprints .
nada .
the whole school' s a goddamn forensic vacuum .
all he left us was one very neatly strangled teacher .
heads are gonna roll with the secret service .
oh .
jezzie flannigan .
alex cross .
agent flannigan was in charge of the secret service detail at cathedral .
dr. cross .
agent flannigan .
i' ve read your books on profiling .
obviously .
not close enough .
but ...
obviously .
not close enough .
but ...
kyle , this shoe was i. d. ' d by the roses .
it' s megars .
dr. alex cross .
special agent in charge ...
oliver macarthur .
how do you do .
sir .
alex .
i' il catch you later .
forensics .
yes .
sir .
senator and mrs. rose are through here .
before we talk to them .
you any idea why soneji is involving you ?
not at all .
this way .
uh .
excuse me .
shouldn' t agent flannigan be in the room with us ?
not a good idea .
miss flannigan is not welcome .
but she' s a material witness .
she failed the roses .
and she failed the service .
i think agent macarthur has a point .
no .
he' s missing the point .
you saw soneji every day .
five days a week .
for how long ?
two years .
you have no idea how much you know about this case .
agent flannigan .
they say that when i die .
the case will die .
they say it' il be like a book i close .
but the book , it will never close .
very poetic .
what the hell is it ?
i' ve left you something for your visit ... with the roses tonight .
you' il find it in your cold , corrugated mailbox .
well .
for what it' s won' th .
that' s soneji .
his speech patterrs the same .
is he .
um ...
are we dealing with a sex maniac ?
someone who might , you know ...
no .
sir .
this man has no such interest in your daughter .
she' s merely a means to an end .
what do you mean ?
i see no standard procedure in anything he' s done .
i disagree .
this is a professional kidnapping .
it' s going to be about money .
which is good .
but you' re saying it isn' t about money .
i think he wants to draw this out .
from what he said , whatever his motives ... it' s very unusual .
what did he mean about the book ?
that it will never close ?
i honestly don' t know .
well .
i think i do .
let me tell you what this gary soneji is up to .
the last thing he wants is good crisis management .
what he wants is to confuse .
rancor .
mixed signals , disorientation , those are his tools .
so .
he calls a local cop .
a damaged cop , shouldering some heavy baggage .
he' s using dr. cross as his messenger ...
excuse me .
the man that kidnapped our daughter didn' t call you .
so your agenda is what ?
to insult the man he did call ?
mrs. rose .
i never intended ...
no , you wait a second .
a madman has our daughter , and for some reason he contacted this man .
do you know why ?
no .
ma' am .
not yet .
hello .
you okay ?
you .
uh ... got any tips for helpless situations ?
well .
you could smoke a can' ton a day .
or you could bounce back .
yeah .
well .
i don' t see anywhere to bounce to .
like to get out of here ?
can i ask you something ?
sure .
what did macarthur mean when he referred to you as damaged ?
last summer .
i let a sting operation get out of control .
my partner was killed .
hello .
megan .
how are you ?
coming to see you .
do you recognize my voice ?
it' s me .
mr. soneji .
hmm ?
i brought you that .
a lovely cup of tea with honey .
i know your throat is sore .
it' il make you feel better .
there you go .
it' s all right .
you have nothing to be scared of .
megan .
i' m not scared .
good .
but you' re wondering what' s going on .
i know what' s going on .
you' re a kidnapper .
and you' re a sick weirdo .
megan .
you' re the most opinionated girl in my class .
think you got that from your mom ?
i wanna go home .
you will .
just promise me you' re going to behave yourself .
okay ?
so .
now listen .
if you need to use the bathroom or anything .
just press that .
okay ?
i wanna go home !
now !
i brought you some fresh clothes .
please !
mr. soneji .
please !
this is a fine gun .
it' s turkish .
handmade .
1924 .
that is nice .
my daddy won it in a game of poker .
aces and eights .
dead mars hand .
that' s about as much as i know about my father .
have a seat .
do you know of any relationship between amy masterson and soneji ?
amy ?
no way .
why do you ask ?
he strangled her .
it' s an act of passion .
it' s a demonstration of will .
a message .
take me seriously .
what do you see ?
dr. cross ...
alex .
alex .
womars intuition .
third eye .
sixth sense ... whatever it is .
i don' t have it .
sure you do .
you just don' t look at it right .
every face has two aspects .
now try looking at it down the middle .
one side at a time .
would you say this man was confident ?
yeah .
narcissistic ?
l i wouldn' t know .
ever see any flashes of hatred ?
no .
no .
no !
anger ?
hostility ?
look .
everything about him was right .
he was always patient .
he was pleasant .
he had a sense of humor .
i mean .
he was the perfect teacher .
what do you see ?
i see ...
no .
i mean about me .
what do you see about me ?
that' s why you' re here .
isn' t it ?
size me up .
evaluate your primary material witness ?
i see that you' re about to start an argument .
i need to help get her back .
what makes you think i want a partner ?
you don' t .
i can understand that .
that' s right .
no .
you can' t .
can i tell you why i don' t care ?
shoot .
look .
when i was assigned to cathedral .
it was a job i didn' t want .
it' s a far cry from working rope lines or flying air force one .
but i have been there for three years .
i have been responsible for megan for three years .
and that little girl means more to me than even a partner .
can you understand that ?
i suppose so .
even if i say no .
you' il probably follow me around wherever i go .
so .
if it' s a choice between having you as a partner ... or as a stalker .
i guess i' il take my chances with a partner .
thank you .
the student drop off is there .
that' s my morning post .
students sign in .
cameras are there .
there .
there and there .
motions sensors all around the periphery .
foolproof way to keep the kooks out .
exactly .
we were always looking in the wrong direction .
which door did he go out ?
uh .
that one there .
it' s a straight shot to his parking space .
let' s go in .
his classroom .
mm hmm .
he was teaching how everything on the internet is connected .
alex .
you got a sec ?
sure .
listen .
i think turf wars are a total waste of time .
if i was out of line last night .
i apologize .
don' t .
i' ve been there .
anything you need .
let me know .
sure .
mac .
dr. cross , you might want to see this .
this was megars desk ?
yeah .
what are you doing ?
scoping glfs .
graphic interchange formats .
they' re all stego encrypted .
somewhere among the billions of zeros and ones making this image ...
is a string of text .
i know about this .
it' s the cutting edge method of passing notes in class .
it' s driving the teachers nuts .
how long before you can access it ?
try never .
you don' t crack stego without a password .
would you take me to his office ?
oh .
when you find soneji .
ask him for the password .
he planted a monitoring virus on the girl' s hard drive .
every keystroke megan hit .
soneji was recording it .
good move .
jezz .
angling for a position with the d. c. p. d. i like that .
dr. cross .
agent ben devine .
agent devine is security systems supervisor .
well .
for now .
we' re going to be thrown to the wolves .
as soon as they find megan rose dead in a ditch .
now what makes you so sure that' s what' s going to happen ?
me getting fired or the girl in a ditch ?
sorry .
i' m having a pessimistic day .
tell me .
soneji .
did he ... did he ever show any interest in what you do ?
how you do it ?
the man never talked to me .
i never talked to him .
well .
thanks for your time .
hello .
what ?
what do you think that is ?
an empty frame .
mm hmm .
otherwise known as ...
a missing picture .
you onto something ?
our missing picture .

our mr. soneji has a sense of humor .
he didn' t just kidnap a little girl .
he turned it into a game .
okay .
let' s see what you know .
mr. lindbergh .

what do you got ?
dr. cross isn' t in cyberspace anymore .
you' re at a live site .
iooking through a video camera .
those arrows down there move it .
where are we ?
i would guess we' re in soneji' s home .
now we' re supposed to find out where that is .

not until we get the go ahead .
his surveillance was better than ours .
he' s been at this for years .
imagine the patience , the dedication .
you sound like an admirer .
well .
he' s ... he' s like a spider .
and i happen to like spiders .
he had an elaborate setup here , boss .
want to see how he stayed clean at school ?
it laminates a plastic veneer over your hands .
look at this .
it' s foam rubber .
looks like he was wearing prosthetic appliances .
i understand the secret service are being cautious tonight .
there is speculation that a full investigation is under way into ...
yes , kevin , one of the secret service agents ...

and before the hood was pulled over his head .
he bragged to his executioner . " ' they think that when i die .
the case will die . " ' they think it will be like a book i close .
' but the book .
it will never close . " '
soneji was quoting the final words of richard bruno hauptman .
i' m sorry .
i don' t follow .
1932 .
the infant son of charles lindbergh .
america' s greatest hero .
was kidnapped .
when bruno hauptman was arrested , what followed became known as ...
the crime of the century .
i believe that soneji wants to do the same thing .
you think we' re dealing with a copycat .
something like that .
dr. cross ... what does he want from you ?
he' s brought me in and left this trail ... because he wants me to make sure that he' s properly appreciated .
but in order for him to achieve this ... he has to kill megan .
no .
no .
not necessarily .
the death of the lindbergh baby was accidental .
nevertheless .
it' s critical that we pull his strings .
the more we make him a living legend .
the more likely he is to keep megan alive .
dr. cross , you' ve been brought into this case , what can you tell us about gary soneji ?
i can tell you that soneji is very determined .
obviously highly capable and we consider him a serious adversary .
what about megan rose ?
megan rose is gary soneji' s ace .
as long as he has her , he' s in control .
sir , would you assign as many agents to this case ... if she wasrt a senator' s daughter ?
the size of our task force is a reflection ... of who gary soneji is .
not megan rose .
mr. soneji .
you can parse the words if you' d like ...
hello ?
i need to go to the bathroom .
all right .
be right there .

you promised me you were going to behave yourself .
because of you .
what you' ve done .
that man is dead .
now ... promise me .
promise me you' re going to be a good little girl .
okay ?
all right ?
say .
yes .
mr. soneji .
say .
yes .
mr. soneji .
y yes .
mr. soneji .
okay .
let' s go have that cup of tea .
i' d say eight hours .
about 9 : 00 a . m .
slugs are large caliber .
shots hit him here .
here .
kill shot tapped him crown of the head .
this here is thomas mathias .
he found all this .
this way .
she' s not in the water .
jezzie .
soneji still has her .
there' s no way of knowing that .
think about it .
megan is precious cargo .
soneji' s not gonna let some twist of fate bring her harm .
right ?
but why megan ?
why her ?
come on .
where are you going ?
back to the city .
we' il talk in the car .
you asked .
why megan ?
why megan ?
who is senator hank rose ?
he' s ...
nobody .
most people don' t even know who he is .
never heard of him .
couldrt pick him out of a lineup .
this is front page news now .
where will it be in two months ?
ayear ?
oblivion .
know why ?
because senator hank rose is no charles lindbergh .
well .
okay .
then .
who is ?
ah .
there' s the troublesome question .
come on .
jezzie .
two years .
five days a week .
you know soneji .
who' s a bigger fish than megan rose ?
da .
mm hmm .
dr. cross .
agent flannigan .
we appreciate your concern .
but .
uh .
dimitri' s fine .
our security services are more than capable ... of protecting the son of the russian president .
can we at least talk to him ?
nothing would please us more than to be of help .
but speaking to dimitri right now would be inappropriate .
thanks for your time .
what ?
well .
macarthur' s dragnetting the bay .
right ?
and .
i mean .
he' s not really missing us .
so i was thinking maybe we could just stick around and .
you know .
scope out the place a bit .
agent flannigan .
are you ... are you suggesting a stakeout here ?
yeah .
you know .
stale coffee .
some doughnuts .
no .
no .
that' s a first class stakeout .
agent flannigan .
what you' re talking about here would be no frills .
you' d only get to think about stale coffee and doughnuts .
well .
i can handle it if you can .
i get the feeling you' ve done this a lot .
oh .
yeah .
every chance i get .
especially when it' s cold and wet .
no parking here .
we' re on the clock .
officer .
everything okay ?
everything is all right .
what' s the problem ?
go ahead .
jezzie .
what ?
have one .
thank you .
alex .
that' s dimitri .
jezzie .
it' s him .
it' s him !
soneji , hold it right there !
jezzie .
shoot the tires !
jezzie !
jezzie !
police !
don' t shoot !
don' t shoot !
jezzie !
jezzie .
you' re gonna get megan back .
right ?
yes .
we are .
i promise .
use this to get mr. soneji .
i will .
thank you .
you talk to hal .
i want you to bring him up to speed .
well done .
guys .
avert an international crisis and paint soneji into a corner .
not bad for a night' s work .
soneji ditched a patrol car near reno park .
hijacked a tan sierra .
one bullet in the driver' s head .
last seen heading toward route 50 .
annapolis .
i knew it .
seventy five thousand boats .
other marinas ?
we' re here .
dead fisherman here .
these .
all the marinas .
all locked down .
patrol boats in each of them .
all right .
listen up .
we gotta move fast .
roadblock route 50 and triple the surveillance in the harbors .
i want two choppers on the pad in five minutes .
let' s go !
what' s wrong ?
i blew it .
that' s what' s wrong .
i had a shot right before he hit the hydrant .
but instead of pulling the trigger .
i was thinking .
i was thinking .
yeah .
you were thinking .
about your shot going astray ... and blowing soneji' s head off .
in which case ...
we would never find megan .
i know that .
well .
then .
don' t beat yourself up for being prudent .
you don' t get it .
i was trained to shoot first and think later .
jezzie .
for heavers sake .
if you hadrt convinced me to stay there .
soneji would have two victims instead of one .
plus we' d have an international incident on our hands .
you did good .
you did good .
yes .
but still ...
anything ?
oh .
not yet .
we' re sitting on the area .

soneji' s on the phone .

we can neither confirm nor deny that gary soneji ... was involved in the incident on the mta train this morning .
we' ve heard that a ransom was paid .
comment ?
i can' t comment on any of that .
what about megan rose ?
i' m not going to go into any details at this time .
what about soneji' s state of mind ?
i' m not going to comment on his mental stability .
you can draw your own conclusions .
now , senator rose has agreed to make a statement ,
so ?
the file on soneji .
is it still on your kitchen table ?
yeah .
why ?
i' m gonna have another look at it .
this business about the diamonds .
money .
i didn' t see it coming .
i am grateful that the f. b. i. is here .
with the objective expertise to find out where my daughter is .
secondly , i now ...
this is worse than killing time .
yeah .
but you' d be amazed at how often the small .
neglected things ... become the most important .
i just got the feeling we' re missing something .
maybe i' m in the wrong line of work .
maybe i should take on something less challenging .
you do what you are .
jezzie .
you mean .
you are what you do .
no .
i mean .
you do what you are .
you' re born with a gift .
if not that .
then you get good at something along the way .
and what you' re good at .
you don' t take for granted .
you don' t betray it .
what if you do betray your gift ?
then .
you betray yourself .
that' s a sad thing .
who is it ?
police .
gary soneji .
hi .
alex .
now .
right hand .
thumb and forefinger .
just give me the gun .
alex .
you can' t shoot me .
you' il never find megan .
sit down .
alex .
i' m i' m a little concerned .
alex .
i' m a little ...
i' m a little worried that you ... you don' t really care to understand me anymore ; that you won' t paint an accurate portrait .
and i need you to convince me that i' m wrong .
in order to do that .
we' re going to have to talk about megan rose .
no .
no bargaining .
alex .
no cheap interrogation techniques .
it' s transparent .
and it' s clumsy .
this is between me and you .
i want you to see .
i want you to look inside here and tell me what the fuck you see !
i' m a gift to you , alex .
i' m a gift to you .
and you are beyond ... pitiful if you cannot understand that .
i' m living proof that a mind ... the mind is a terrible thing .
i see you' ve got your sense of humor back .
yeah .
i wondered what happened to it during the ransom drop .
the ransom drop .
that was a well earned 12 million .
twelve million .
senator rose says he can pull strings .
he says he can fix it so you keep the 12 million and walk .
all you have to do is return the child .
where is megan ?
where' s megan ?
where is megan ?
where' s megan ?
where is megan ?
where is megan ?
she' s trapped on my boat .
alex .
isn' t that right ?
or maybe she' s stuck in a warehouse somewhere or floating in a river .
swinging from the end of a rope .
buried alive .
i envy her .
what would life had been like with parents like that ?
come on , gary , blaming your parents for what you are ?
i' m not blaming them , alex .
they' ve been punished already .
i burned down the house while they slept .
i was 15 years old .
was it what you expected ?
not really .
it was a new experience .
what .
killing ?
no .
being in the newspapers .
so , in your opinion , doctor , were my actions triggered by nature ... or nurture ?
if you want me to be brutally honest ...
i think you just have a morbid desire to burn in hell .
we' re done for today .
i' m taking her with me .
you' re not taking her anywhere .
i' il send her back to you .
you just tell me which piece you want first .
aah !
ow !
oh , shit !
damn it .
alex !
oh .
my god .
what have you done ?
what have you d done ?
residents of this normally quiet suburb are still in shock ... as news of the shooting of gary soneji .
america' s most wanted man .
filtered through their community .
apparently , soneji had attempted to confront , or even harm ... members of the kidnapping task force hunting him .
so .
he came after jezzie as payback for dimitri .
ostensibly .
yeah .
that' s how you want it on record ?
yeah .
for now .
here they come .
dr. cross .
tell me you have at least an idea where my little girl is .
i' m sorry .
sir .
i can' t .
you kill the one man who has the answers .
and you' re telling me you haven' t a clue .
not one clue ?
the man walked in the fucking room .
and you shot him .
senator ... standing in his shoes .
i' d have done the same thing .
sir .
that' s your job .
not his .
he' s supposed to find my little girl .
not shoot the man who knows where she is .
senator .
it' s not over .
the book is not closed .
alex ... thank you for saving my life .
good bye .
jezzie .
wanna hear something funny .
mac ?
sure .
cheer me up .
i congratulated soneji on scoring $ 12 million .
you mean ten million .
exactly .
he had no idea what i was talking about .
i know you .
you work at my school .
eat your food .
megan .
alex .
where is this going ?
we' ve been through these tapes backwards and forwards .
i can' t see how this is helping us find megan .
you know what i see , mac ?
someone was onto soneji long before we ever heard of him .
look at this .
what do you see ?
agent devine hauling ass out to the front gate .
mac .
he could have shut this whole place down from right there .
now .
you wanna tell me why he didn' t ?
good god .
devine was in on it with him .
then .
when soneji hit the embassy .
he pulled a double cross .
he ran his own ransom .
no .
soneji was a loner .
an accomplice would have been beneath him .
i' il tell you what happened .
soneji was hoodwinked .
and so were we .
details are still emerging .
the manunt that began over a week ago in the natiors capitol ...
came to a violent end yesterday , [ clattering ]
with the death of kidnapper , gary soneji .
don' t move .
turn around .
hands on the wall .
feet apart .
hi .
jez .
where' d you come from ?
you know something .
devine .
you' re pretty stupid .
your car in the driveway .
tv so loud .
you wouldn' t be able to hear a swat team come in .
what are you doing ...
shut up !
where' s megan ?
she' s in the barn .
she was so doped up .
i don' t think she knew i took her off the boat .
she' s still alive ?
you were supposed to dump her in the river ...
after you got the diamonds .
yeah .
well .
maybe killing a kid is something i' m not prepared to do on my own .
anyway .
today .
tomorrow .
it' s still gonna look like soneji killed her .
she can' t die after soneji .
you idiot .
it doesn' t make any difference .
they' re never gonna find the body .
okay .
i' il go do it now .
will that make you happy ?
yeah .
it would .
wait !
can i see them ?
hey .
do you realize we spent an entire year ... following soneji' s every move ?
i think we deserve these .
that beats the hell out of a secret service pension .
huh ?
profiling the profiler .
kidnap from the kidnapper .
that' s brilliant .
you are a genius .
jez .
genius has nothing to do with it .
i' m just good at what i do .
didrt hurt that everyone else involved was a complete half wit .
you think alex cross is a half wit ?
you really believe that he shot soneji to save my life ?
cross pulled the trigger because he knew soneji didn' t have megan .
what are you saying ?
i' m saying that sooner or later .
he' s gonna figure it out .
he already knows soneji didn' t run the ransom .
he' s onto us already .
isn' t he ?
no .
he' s not onto us .
but i think he' s onto you .
it' s turkish .
my daddy won it in a game of poker .
that' s about as much as i know about my father .
megan ?
megan .
it' s me .
honey .
jezzie ?
jezzie ?
jezzie .
jezzie .
i' m in here !
jezzie !
open up .
honey .
i' m gonna take you home .
it' s all over .
yeah .
sure .
just hold on a second .
jezzie ?
yeah .
honey .
what happened to that other guy ?
he' s dead .
megan .
you' re safe now .
open up .
jezzie ?
yeah , honey .
why isn' t there anyone else with you ?
megan .
it' s me .
don' t be scared of me .
open the door .
megan , i' m gonna ask you one more time to open the door .
right now .
open the door !
megan , open the door for me .
listen to me !
open the door !
megan .
open the fucking door !
open it , bitch !
stop it !
no !
stop it !
that was very clever .
megan .
shh .
shh .
shh .
jezzie ?
it' s over .
drop the gun .
alex ... how how did you .
um ...
aces and eights .
jezzie .
plus , your timing was a little off .
i watched the tapes .
you and devine could have stopped soneji at the school .
just like you could have stopped him at the russian embassy .
but you had a different agenda .
you know something .
alex ?
when you said .
you do what you are .
you were right .
i' m living proof .
put the gun down .
jezzie .
would you kill another partner ?
you' re not my partner .
are you all right ?
you' re a very brave girl .
megan .
who are you ?
i' m a policeman .
my name is alex cross .
i' m a friend of your parents .
can you take me to them ?
nothing would give me greater pleasure .
could you ...
ah .
thanks .
