i was lucky .
i came from the most beautiful place on earth ... ... where music was everywhere .
and people believed there was no difference ... ... between being awake and dreaming .
my dream was always clear .
for as long as i could remember , i wanted to be a musician .
that' s my mother .
she' s the one who taught me how to sing .
that' s me .
whenever i heard her voice , all i wanted was to be held in her arms ... ... so i could be closer to the source of the magic .
when my mother suddenly died ... ... i felt like everything around me had died too .
i couldn' t feel anything anymore .
the only thing that kept me going were the letters from uncle alfonso .
he' d gone to los angeles and made it big in the restaurant business .
he said the streets really were paved with gold if you worked hard enough .
i didn' t know what to do , so i asked my grandfather , a very wise man ... ... what he thought .
and he told me that all of life is a dream ... ... and i should choose my dreams carefully ... ... because they' re very powerful things .
so i set off to chase my dream ;
los angeles , city of angels .
and my future ?
well , yet to unfold .
who would' ve thought i' d end up like this ?
it turned out that uncle alfonso wasn' t the taco king of l. a.
he didn' t even own the place .
but he was the assistant manager and he did get me this job ... ... so i shouldn' t complain , but i can' t take those hats .
here she comes .
okay .
hi .
hello .
what can i do for you ?
i' il have a happy burrito combo with extra cheese .
that' s nina , the love of my life .
and she doesn' t even know that i exist .
okay .
happy burrito with extra cheese .
to go .
to go .
absolutely .
hi there , baby doll ... ... angel ... ... precious ... ... beautiful pussycat .
when you look at me ... ... you kill me .
you make me chase my tail in circles .
okay , that' s going to be 3 . 75 .
and i' m really sorry about him .
yeah , whatever .
that' s 3 ... ... and that' s 4 .
there you go .
have a beautiful day .
thank you .
you' il be back , pussycat .
i know it .
don' t bet on it , taco boy .
dude , you suck .
you know that women don' t like your macho comments .
what they appreciate is to be spoken to with respect .
respeto , that' s what it' s all about , chivo .
what you talking about ?
she was hot .
didn' t you see that ?
i' il show some respeto .
i' il be like , " call me taco boy !
call me taco boy !
it' s amazing what depths a person will sink to when they get desperate .
but as long as i could play my music , i didn' t care .
most people have forgotten about the dreams that brought them here .
but then again , so have i.
well , thank you .
thank you very much .
this next song is " lonely girl .
and remember , the more you drink , the better i sound .
thank you .

thank you very much .

hi .
i just wanted to say to you that ... ... that i' m really sorry about my coworker' s behavior the other day .
he' s just not ...
he' s not very smart sometimes .
you' re the guy from the taco place .
yeah .
i' m antonio .
i' m nina .
how are you ?
look , i wanted to ask you ... ... i don' t know if you wanted to go to dinner or dancing this friday ... ... i was wondering if you were available to do me the honor ?
is that a date you' re asking for ?
i think so .
i' m flattered , but i will have to say no .
because i have to work on friday .
okay .
i' m sorry .
maybe some other time .

i' m gonna be there anyway , friday night at la zona rosa ... ... if you ...
lf you change your mind or ...

bye .
thank you .
who was that ?
i don' t know .
just some guy .
what' s up , uncle ?
antonio , look around this place .
it doesn' t take all these people to roll a burrito .
we have way too many workers .
we' re gonna have to let someone go .
since you were the last one hired ... ... i guess you have to be the first one fired .
i can' t do anything about it .
it' s corporate .
but i' m family !
i' m your blood !
i' m really sorry .
here .
here' s a week' s pay .

yeah , but nobody wants to hear my music .
girls don' t wanna be with a broke musician .
i don' t know .
i' m scrawny , i' m short .
don' t let nobody tell you about what people wanna hear .
people get tired of being sold the same old thing over and over again .
after a while , they look for something real .
you think ?
yeah , that' s why i took this npr job .
oh , the npr job , right .
because that pays the big dollars .
i don' t know .
maybe you should enter that contest .
what contest ?

jos jos .
you know , my father used to play with him .
and he told me some gossip .
he said that jos jos' s father ... ... only wanted classical music in the house ... ... because he was an operatic singer ... ... and forbade him to play that pop .
well ...
i want to see that . ... let' s see if you know who this is .

perfidia .
perfidia .

when they told xavier cugat that his music ... ... was too much middle of the road ... ... he said , " well , i' d rather play ' chiquita banana ' ... ... and have a swimming pool than play bach and starve .
he said that ?
yes , he did .
how come you know so much ?
because i' m a geek , that' s why .
what are you doing ?
what are you talking about ?
you' re just incredible , the way you sing .

i used to sing .
but that was a long time ago .
with my ex , javier .

i feel like anything can happen up here .
i don' t know , like i can lick the stars .

he' s gonna need some extra care for a while , but he' s gonna fully recover .
can i see him now ?
yeah , sure .
thank you .
this way .
stop .
i just don' t know ... ... why he left his children .
that i' il never understand .
all right , all right .
you call child welfare ... ... and you report him .
that is what you do .
i can' t .
you are not over him , are you ?
i am so completely over that pig of a man .
you know what i' m gonna do ?
i am gonna do a psychic reading .
oh , god , no .
yes , and you' re gonna love it .
that' s what you need right now .
and are you ready ?
no .
here we go .
there' s a man nearby .
it' s giving me three clues .
what do you mean , clues ?
well , so that you' il recognize him when you meet him .
first , he will be a great lover of music .
oh , that' s nice .
second , he will cherish the color red .
he will serve you ... ... the greatest meal you have ever had .
so fabulous that you will scream with joy .
or it might be the other way around where you' re serving him the meal .
i don' t know .
but either way , there' s food involved , for sure .
when do i meet him ?
i don' t know .
pap , i was so scared .
nina .
nina .
i thought i was gonna lose you too .
why did you even worry ?
you know i wouldn' t leave you .
not yet , anyway .
you know , nina ... ... i died for a minute , and guess what .
i saw mam .
really ?
how is she ?
oh , she is doing great .
beautiful as ever .
and you know what else ?
she says she will wait for me until it' s my time to cross over .
and she will have a big plate of my favorite spicy tamales ... ... just for me , so i can smell my way to the other side .
that' s sweet , pap .
just as long as you' re not planning on having those tamales too soon .
mam told me it is not my time yet .
no , it was amazing .
he actually talked to his dead wife .
no , it was amazing .
he actually talked to his dead wife .
well , what was that ... ?
how did he end up ... ?
what was the communication between them ?
it was tamales .
tamales ?
yeah .
imagine that .
now , let' s go .
here we are .
they' re great , huh ?
nobody knows who they are yet .
but they' re on their way up .
that' s pancho on the guitar , enrique on the bass ... ... and jos on the drums .
hey , raj .
raj , can i ask you something ?
how long you been together with your girlfriend ?
my fiance .
and i' ve known her for about three years .
three years , huh ?
raj ?
yep .
how did you know that she was the one ?
first time i saw her , i knew .
you knew .
and did she know too ?
are you kidding ?
i had to chase her around like some crazy fool .
but you know what they say , when a man knows , he knows .
it' s black and white for us men , no gray stuff in between .
right .
that' s right .
raj .
last question .
how did you hook her ?
i mean , how did you win her over ?
what did you do ?
well , i never gave up , but i didn' t crowd her either .
i bought her a lot of beautiful gifts .
and most importantly , i made her confident i' d be able to provide for her .
women wanna know that a guy can take care of her ... ... a guy that can really bring home the bacon .
i say this even though i' m a vegetarian .
well , thank you .
you' re welcome .
okay , okay .
look , i hope i' m not bothering you .
look , i just want to give you these flowers , that' s all .
nothing more .
no , really .
she wouldn' t believe that .
dr. lopez will be here soon to check up on you , pap .
thank you , mija .
here , let me close the curtains so you can watch your show better .
no , mija , that' s okay .
i like them open .
look , i' m not stalking you .
no , why would i ?
see ?
it' s better like this .
fuck !
stop !
what ?
what was that all about ?
what was what all about ?
you .
i mean , come on .
the band is not all about you and your guitar .
i know that , it' s just we' re playing with old amps .
yeah ?
you have to open them wide up or else it doesn' t sound good .
you should know this .
all right .
all right .
can we just break it down a little bit so i could hear myself ?
one , two .
one , two , three , four .
okay .
wait , wait .
pancho !
pancho !
pancho , i thought you told me you were cool with this setup .
you told me you were not the lead vocalist type .
i never said that , man .
okay .
look ...
look , we came here together for the contest , all right ?
and exposure is something ... ... that each and every one of you needs right now .
so let' s drop the egos ... ... and let' s get out of the way of the music , okay ?
i don' t know what' s wrong with me , man .
i' m sorry , man .
i don' t know what happened to me .
i don' t know what' s wrong with me .
we never had any trouble before that guy came in .
you know what i mean ?
i think he plays good .
well , yeah , i mean , the guy can play .
but he ...
he doesn' t have the mojo that we need for the band , you know ?
yeah .
look , guys , just go with me on this one , all right ?

that' s not what i meant .
i mean , that' s why i came by , because i wanted to help you .
well , there' s nothing that you can really do .
i just have to be here .
that' s why he got in trouble in the first place ... ... because i wasn' t here for him .
but now is when you really need your friends , right ?
i brought you something .
no , i can' t take it .

i want you to have it .

antonio .

i just wanted to thank you for reminding me ... ... that my world is music .
antonio , i ...

zorro , i don' t know , i don' t know .
nina' s driving me crazy .
my mind' s on fire .
i don' t know what to do .
you' il be fine .
hi .
hey .
are you antonio hernandez ?
yeah .
that' s me .
what can i do for you ?
we' re from estrella arts management .
yeah ?
we' d like to talk about your career .
we saw you play at the tryouts .
we think you' ve got potential .
well , thank you .
that' s very nice of you to say .
there' s a great deal of talk lately from the major record labels ... ... about recruiting a fresh , new latin talent .
a solo act to be the next big crossover .
but i' m not a solo act .
with our help , you could be huge .
playing mainstream songs in english .
i don' t know , maybe you have the wrong guy .
maybe less ruffles .
okay .
i' il be right back .
will you start on the hem , hon ?
of course .
you really do look gorgeous , you know ?
it would look a lot better on you .
no way .
i' m too skinny .
look at me .
i wish i could have some nice curves like you do .
i' m a stick .
why do we worry about our bodies all the time ?
we' re never satisfied , are we ?
yeah , and it' s usually just to please a man .
i' ve decided that i don' t need a man .
but there is ... ... someone that you' re crazy about , isn' t there ?
why do you say that ?
i saw you and antonio at the party .
i' m not ready to get serious with anyone .
do you love him ?
i don' t know .
he loves you .
really ?
oh , i' m sure of it .
so , what we' re offering is to manage you ... ... and set you up as a solo act .
i know .
i understand that .
but i already have a manager .
look , i know your manager , and he' s a really nice guy ... ... but he hasn' t been in the game for years .
he just can' t do for you what we can .
you know , antonio , sometimes you just have to forget about the past .
this is a fast paced industry .
if you don' t grab your chance when it comes around , you get left behind .
forgotten .
yesterday' s news .
i mean , to be honest with you ... ... it has always been my dream to just make an album .
i just want to have a cd , that' s all .
well , better yet , how about a record deal ?
you really think so ?
you don' t think it' s too late ?
i still have a chance ?
we wouldn' t be here if we didn' t .
well , look , i really gotta think it over .
sure .
but don' t take too long .
this one is on us .
i got it .
thank you .
i' il take it over there for you .
well , thank you for coming .
okay .
sorry my hands are dirty .
it' s okay .
i mean , they' re not dirty , they' re just greasy .
i' il be in touch , okay ?
okay .
thanks .
thank you .
here you go .
this should be it .
what' s up ?
so you got a record deal , huh ?
maybe .
well , good for you , man .
hey !
zorro , i' m so glad you' re here .
i need to talk to you .
can we talk later ?
we' re late .
please , i gotta talk to you .
if you were me ... ... and all of a sudden you had opportunities you worked so hard for ...
opportunities ?
when we' re done ... ... you' il have more than you ever know .
no , i know , but listen to me .
if you had to then make a choice between two things ... ... that you really wanted ...
listen .
let me tell you something .
this is the reason i became a manager to begin with ... ... to bring beautiful music to the world .
we' re gonna bring boleros back to life .
i' m excited about this .
are you excited ?
yes .
of course .
come on .
let' s go inside .
come on .
let' s go .
okay .
i had a sofa made out of this material .
you look wonderful .
i don' t look like i' m going to a funeral ?
no .
you look very handsome .
thank you .
don' t spill on your jackets .
no .
oh , my goodness , she looks beautiful .
you look great !
we' re back with pancho from all star gringo star .
so are you excited about the finals ?
do you think you got a good chance ?
yeah , i think we do have a really good chance .
now you told me earlier ... ... that the contest has generated so much publicity ... ... that there' s talk of record industry interest .
yeah , yeah .
well , not for us , unfortunately , just yet .
but i did hear that the lead singer from el gran colectivo ... ... is signing up with a new manager ... ... and is going solo right after the contest , so ...
imagine that .
so he' il be going out on his own ?
yes , the best of luck for him .
i' m sure your band will stay together ... ... and you guys are gonna do just fantastic , pancho .
you are too kind .
thank you very much .
antonio , we need to talk to you .
what is this we hear in the news ... ... that you have a new deal with a new manager ?
and that you' re going solo ?
how could you do that to zorro and mirabela ?
how could you do that to us ?
i thought what we had was good .
i' m really sorry .
i should' ve told you what was going on .
yeah , what' s going on ?
i feel really bad .
you know ...
because i keep things inside , and i should say what i' m feeling ...
oh , please .
so it' s true .
no , mirabela , wait .
i did get the offer .
and let me tell you , it was really tempting , but ...
antonio , we' d be happy for you .
just don' t do it behind our backs .
i turned it down .
because ...
because we' re better all together .
our music is all of us .
are you sure ?
of course i' m sure .
because i don' t have a big office downtown .
who cares about a big office downtown ?
those big office people never believed in me like you did .
you' re gonna bring the bolero back to the people " ?
what happened to that ?
okay .
all right .
all right .
hi .
hey .
how are you ?
guess what .
what ?
i' m going to vet school .
that' s great .
i' m so happy for you .
that' s everything you wanted , right ?
it' s great .
i wanted to say i' m sorry .
sorry for what ?
i think i' ve been really stupid .
no , no , you had a lot going on .
you couldn' t help but be stupid .
i' m just kidding .
i mean , what' s important right now ... ... is that you become everything your mother said you should become .
but ... ... what about us ?
what about us ?
you think that ... ... maybe we can ... ... start again where we left off ?
but why ?
i mean , i don' t know how you feel about me .
yes , you do .
no , i don' t .
yes , you do .
you' re gonna go off to vet school ... ... find some vet and do some animal experiments .
dissect animals and ...
thank you for shutting me up .
i want you , antonio .
really ?
my name is marco mendez from super estrella ... ... and welcome to the mystery musician contest .
tonight , one lucky band is gonna be named the winner ... ... and will open for the mystery musician next week .
but that' s not all .
because that band ... ... is gonna walk off with $ 10, 000 cash today .
zo !
so ... ... how' s everybody feeling ?
have you seen how many people are out there ?
we' ve never competed before .
three hundred people .
they got nothing on you .
nothing .
i' m not gonna lie to you , this is a big night .
but all those people out there ... ... they' re your friends , they' re your family , they' re your supporters ... ... they' re on your side .
this isn' t about competition .
you gotta forget about competing .
this is about doing what it is that you do .
and what is it that you do ?
you play .
right .
yeah .
that' s right .
and you know what ?
you' ve gotta love what you do .
they' il feel that .

look , man , i ...
this whole thing just got out of hand .
i' m sorry .

yeah , well , don' t expect too much and you won' t regret too much .
okay , now give it up for all star gringo star .
