the latest ceasefire came too late to save these villages ...
today president clinton voiced concerns at the deteriorating situation in sarajevo ...
when people ask me , good listeners , why do i hate all the tutsi ,
i say , " read our history .
the tutsi were collaborators for the belgian colonists .
they stole our hutu land , they whipped us .
now they have come back , these tutsi rebels .
they are cockroaches .
they are murderers .
rwanda is our hutu land .
we are the majority .
they are a minority of traitors and invaders .
we will squash the infestation .
we will wipe out the rpf rebels .
this is rtlm , hutu power radio .
stay alert .

things are very slow at the shop , how are things at the hotel ?
very busy , many people visiting the gorillas ,
a lot of foreign press arriving for the peace acc
what ?
there are soldiers ,
where ?
on the street ,
i' il go see what' s happening , it' s all right ,
we know you are tutsi , please , sir , this is my husband ,
he' s kust a gardener , he' s been spying for the rebels ,
no , we do not know any rebels , you will come with us !
no , we are telling the truth , we do not know any ,,,
what is it ?
shut up !
tatiana , go back in the house , you must go back ,
you mustn' t be out here , it' s victor ,
no , captain , you see
it' s not me , it' s not me , captain , captain ,

victor !
there is nothing we can do ,
you must stay the night , thomas , yes ,
no !
why would they arrest victor ?
he has no politics ,
he' s a gardener , who knows , tatsi ?
who knows ?
someone who didn' t like him denounced him as a rebel spy ,
happens all the time now ,
maybe you could call one of your contacts in the army ,
it wouldn' t help ,
you could ask as a favor ,
no , i could not ,
tatsi , all day long i work to please this officer , that diplomat , some tourist , to store up favors so if there is a time when we need help ,
i have powerful people i can call upon ,
but victor was a good neighbor ,
he is not family , family is all that matters ,
please , please , leave these things to my good kudgment ,
this assignment is bullshit ,
come on , a few days in a nice hotel , no one shooting at us ?
gentlemen , welcome to the mille collines , i am paul rusesabagina , the house manager ,
how you doing ?
nice to meet you ,
anything that you need , please find me ,
thank you , certainly ,
so , what is the actual difference between a hutu and a tutsi ?
according to the belgian colonists , the tutsis are taller and more elegant ,
it was the belgians that created the division ,
how ?
they picked people , those with thinner noses , lighter skin ,
they used to measure the width of people' s noses ,
the belgians used the tutsis to run the country ,
then when they left , they left the power to the hutus , and of course the hutus took revenge on the elite tutsis for years of repression ,
am i telling the truth , paul ?
yes , unfortunately , please take this to the general ,
benedict is our finest kournalist in kigali , an expert on the subkect ,
so what are you , paul ?
i am hutu ,
gentlemen ,
more champagne ?
more champagne would be nice ,
excuse me , honey , can i ask you a personal question ?
are you a hutu or a tutsi ?
i am tutsi ,
and your friend ?
tutsi ?
no , i am hutu ,
they could be twins ,
get the camera , the general' s going to give us an interview ,
okay ,
i' m in room 22 , i' d love to finish up this conversation ,
senior u. n. officers claim that the rwandan army is secretly training and arming the hutu militia called the interhamwe .
i put this claim to the head of the armed forces , general bizimungu .
no .
no , we have not been training the militia .
the u. n. are mistaken in this accusation .
do you support your president' s agreement to make peace with the rebels ?
the president has the full support of the army .
that peace agreement will be signed today in tanzania between tutsi rebel forces and president habyarimana .
this is a great day for rwanda and for all of africa ,
negotiation has replaced confrontation ,,,
paul , have a drink ,
friendship has replaced fear ,
ladies and gentlemen , we have a live feed to the signing of the peace agreement ,
to our president , may he find peace ,
may we all find peace ,
let us all dedicate ourselves to nurturing this hard earned accord ,
to peace !
peace !
look me up if you come over , yes , it is a beautiful city ,
i am planning on returning there as forgive me ,
thank you , bye , thomas ,
hello , fedens ,
paul , well , this is a surprise ,
forgive us , paul , we must talk ,
yes , what' s wrong ?
i have it from a very reliable source , paul ,
who ?
thank you , sullivan ,
my assistant , the hutu power man ,
he says that we must get out now , that soon it' il be very bad ,
give me this man' s name ,
please , paul , even though he is lnterhamwe , he' s a friend ,
he wants your kob , thomas ,
he said that there is a signal ,
it is " cut the tall trees ,
and when they hear this signal , the militia are to go to war ,
paul , please , let us take tatiana with us ,
you are hutu , you will be safe ,
fedens , i know you have heard many things ,
and i know what we have seen , thomas ,
but please , the united nations are here now ,
the world press are watching ,
the peace has been signed , let this process work

i met you on your last visit here , mr , tillens ,
ah , yes , paul , i remember ,
how are things there ?
the situation is difficult , sir .
some of our directors believe we should close the mille collines until this unrest is over ,
i' m not sure about that , paul .
what do you think ?
sir , that would be very bad for our reputation , the mille collines is an oasis of calm for all our loyal customers ,
what would they think if sabena deserted them now ?
i assure you , the united nations have everything under control , sir ,
very well , paul , very well ,
but if this thing gets worse , we must close ,
if there is anything i can do , please call ,
sir , yes , there is one thing i' m going to be needing from you right away ,
let me tell you , it was an embarrassment for me to have to ask for this ,
most of us in this room have known each other and worked together for many years ,
is it really necessary for me to get a letter from belgium for you to perform your duties ?
in fact , forget this letter ,
if you don' t want to work for me and would rather be out there , then leave now ,
please , everyone , back to work ,
paul , thank you for coming ,
the air conditioner' s on the blink , ls there any way you can have a look at it ?
i' m kust on a deadline , certainly ,
fred , let me know when you get the satellite feed , thanks ,
mr , fleming , i brought you some tea as well , sir ,
thank you , paul ,
you' re an oasis in the desert , ... the elements of the government and army are following the example of what happened to the americans in somalia .
i think they intend to intimidate us , try to attack us , and ... hope that the west will pull all its troops out .
do you think they' il succeed ?
no , they won ' t .
the u. n. ' s here to stay .
what about the outbreak of violence since the shooting down of the president' s plane ?
what the hell do you think you' re doing ?
i' m responsible for the safety of this crew ,
what is this ?
where did you get this ?
half a mile down the road ,
fred , it' s david ,
i' ve got incredible footage , it' s a massacre ,

excuse me , mr , daglish , hey , paul ,
listen , sorry about earlier ,
if i' d known you were in there , i wouldn' t have
i am glad that you have shot this footage and that the world will see it ,
it is the only way we have a chance that people might intervene ,
yeah , and if no one intervenes , is it still a good thing to show ?
how can they not intervene when they witness such atrocities ?
i think if people see this footage ,,, ,,, they' il say , " oh , my god , that' s horrible , " and then go on eating their dinners ,
what the hell do i know ?
listen , you wanna kust relax ?
i have more work to do , i thank you for your offer ,
