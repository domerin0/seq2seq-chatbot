i can' t sleep in the ground like you .

and i' m sure no nest could possibly be big enough for me .
maybe you know where i can stay .
in the woods somewhere ?
you do ?
will you take me there ?

and cheerfully together we can tidy up the place
so hum a merry tune
it won' t take long when there' s a song to help you set the pace
and as you sweep the room
imagine that the broom is someone that you love
and soon you' il find you' re dancing to the tune
oh , no , no , no , no !
put them in the tub .
when hearts are high the time will fly
so whistle while you work

mummy dust " to make me old .
to shroud my clothes , the black of night .
to age my voice , an old hag' s cackle .
to whiten my hair , a scream of fright .
a blast of wind ... to fan my hate !
a thunderbolt ... to mix it well .

a perfect disguise .
