ferguson , herman .
hacker .
lilegal tampering with city droids , computers , cash machines , taxi robots ..
and you haven' t even been out of jail for 24 hours .
he' s habitual , hershey .
automatic five year sentence .
how do you plead ?
not guilty ?
i knew you' d say that .
five years ?
no !
no !
i ...
i had no choice .
they were killing each other .
you could' ve gone out the window .
40 floors ?
it would' ve been suicide .
maybe ... but it' s legal .
judges ?
yes , sir ?
what ?
five years .
aspen penitentiary .
case closed .
take him away .
don' t close the case .
you' re misjudging me !
open the case !
you' re not going to be able to sleep tonight .
he might' ve been telling the truth , you know .
haven' t you ever heard of extenuating circumstances ?
i' ve heard it all , hershey .
i knew you' d say that .
my fellow judges , have we forgotten the lessons of history ?
my fellow judges , have we forgotten the lessons of history ?
however quickly these block wars can be contained , it' s clear that they' re becoming an epidemic ; an epidemic that should be dealt with ... immediately .
the only solution is a tougher criminal code .
our situation gets worse every day .
73 citizen riots in 16 different sectors in the last two months alone .
violent crime is rising at 15/ o every quarter .
lf we don' t increase our resources , they will be inadequate in less than three years .
three years ?
our resources are inadequate now !
my fellow council members , as a city we continue to grow , and growth is painful .
sixty five million people living in an area designed for no more than 20 !
it' s not enough that they rely on us ... for food , clothes , water , clean air ..
chief justice , the city is in chaos !
for social order , we need tighter reins .
lncarceration hasn' t worked as a deterrent .
i say we expand execution to include lesser crimes !
my fellow judges ,
i was barely in my teens when i put on this badge .
when the time comes for me to take it off , please let me do so knowing that it still stands for freedom ... and not for repression .
53 hospitalized .
nineteen dead , four of them killed by a gang of squatters ... who were themselves killed in summary executions by judge dredd .
as my special undercover report continues ,
i will take you behind the scenes at the halls of justice ... for a disturbing probe into these recent riots and block wars .
coincidence ... or deliberate ?
dredd !
dredd !
some people think working these mean streets has a dehumanizing effect on ..
joseph .
chief justice fargo .
you may stand at ease , joseph .
so , tell me .
seven summary executions .
were they necessary ?
unavoidable , sir .
unavoidable .
life doesn' t mean much to some people anymore .
you' d see that if you weren' t always ..
lf i weren' t what ?
always at the academy , sir .
oh !
don' t you mean , at the academy wiping cadets ' asses ?
that' s what they say in the squad room , isn' t it ?
it' s irrelevant .
you set the standard , sir .
now you do ... at least to many young cadets .
you' re a legend .
sir .
you remember your days as a cadet , joseph ?
i remember what you taught me , sir .
you were my finest student .
so , i' ve drawn a new assignment for you .
starting tomorrow , you' re going to spend two days a week at the academy .
i' d be honored , sir . narmed combat or marksmanship ?
ethics .
wait here .
remain still . ldentify yourself .
miller .
warden .
voice sample recognized .
thank you , warden .
system disarmed .
why are you here ?
did you come for another chat ?
just a short one , i' m afraid .
duty calls .
ah , duty !
feeding these parasites here at the public' s expense ?
yeah .
you especially !
i don' t cost anything .
i' m a ghost .
and we' re both prisoners here .
you' re behind your desk ... and i' m behind this .
what a clever reward from fargo , huh ?
i mean , considering the services .
when you started killing innocent people , rico , you went beyond service .
the innocent exist only until they inevitably become perpetrators ...
like you .
guilt and innocence ... is a matter of timing .
your ..
our mysterious benefactor ... has sent you a package .
deactivate shield .
autoguns only .
autoguns reactivated , warden miller .
hmm .
what is that ?
it' s an ancient puzzle ... that contains the meaning of life .
so , tell me , rico , what is the meaning of life ?
it ends .
stop !
computer !
activate alarm !
voice not recognized .
guns are training .
remain still .
security , override and unlock !
come on !

malfunction .
hmm ?
yours if you can ever get it to work .
all of these things you see here are toys .
at the end of the day when you' re all alone in the dark , the only thing that counts ... is this : the law .
and you will be alone when you swear to uphold these ideals .
for most of us , there' s only death in the streets .
for the few of us that survive to old age , the proud loneliness of the long walk .
a walk that every judge must take ... outside these city walls ... into the unknown of the cursed earth .
and there spend your last remaining days ... taking law to the lawless .
this is what it means to be a judge .
this is the commitment i expect .
class dismissed .
attention all personnel .
due to the recent disturbance in heavenly haven , there will be increased patrols in sector 4 .
please check with your commanders to see if you are affected ... by these scheduled changes .
i can hear you thinking .
i caught your lecture today .
ls that really what you think the cadets need to hear ?
what i told them is the truth .
your truth maybe .
you made it sound like our lives are practically over .
don' t you think ... parts are , hershey ?
i have a personal life .
i have friends .
you' re one of the smartest of the new breed , but you' ve only been on the street a year .
you haven' t gotten used to the isolation yet .
no .
no , i don' t think that' s right .
no one is supposed to be alone all the time .
i mean , is that really what it' s been like for you ? don' t you ever .. haven' t you ever had a friend ?
yes .
once .
what happened ?
dredd , wait .
i want to know .
what happened ?
i judged him .
aspen shuttle has completed off loading .
cargo and morgue shipments from aspen .
okay .
let' s get outta here .
get your nose filters !
get your nose filters !
please select your fantasy now and enjoy . ... who were themselves killed ... in summary executions by judge dredd .
as my special undercover report continues ,
i will take you behind the scenes at the halls of justice .
we' re closed for the night .
you' re holding a package for me .
the code name is lazarus .
i' il just be a second .
you got a nice place .
yeah .
a lot of this is antiques .
i thought they destroyed all these a. b. c. warriors during the last war .
well , you can still collect ' em ... as long as they' re nonfunctioning ...
like my wife .
these must be 50 or 60 years old now .
anyway ... there you go .
hey , wait a second !
don' t touch it .
why is that ?
it' s a lawgiver .
that' s programmed to only recognize a judge' s hand .
you touch that , it' il take your arm off .
gee ... how do you like that ?
i must be a judge .
happy birthday .
status ?
bodyguard .
commander ?
rico .
mission ?
mission ?
we' re going to war .
war .
i followed up some grumblings confirming a suspicion of mine .
the cancer of oppression goes far deeper than the street judges .
you' re going to say that over the air ?
it' s the truth !
oh , vardas , you' re insane .
i' m a reporter .
they' re never going to let this get onto the air .
something like this could bring down the council . maybe it should . the whole system is the problem , not just judge ..
dredd .
no !
judge hershey , corner of burns and allen . level " d .
possible d .. l .
may need assistance .
here we go !
step out of the car , please .
what the hell' s the problem now ?
get out of the car ! nicard , please .
did you hear me ? nicard !
mr. souza .
you have a suspended license .
you' ve got three counts of driving under the influence .
hey , you better listen .
i suggest you walk away and bother somebody else .
when i said i have powerful friends , i mean powerful !
are we having a problem , hershey ?
not at all .
nothing i can' t handle .
suspended license .
three d .. l . ' s .
this is getting boring .
okay , so what' s the tab ?
c' mon .
how much is this going to cost me ?
you name your price .
hershey , call control for an h wagon .
what ?
i don' t believe it .
you' re going to tow me ?
towing is for a first offense .
this is your fourth violation , bar breath .
you' re a menace .
how do you plead ?
not guilty .
i knew you' d say that .
wait a second .
what are you doing ?
grenade .
grenade .
no !
happy motoring .
subtle .
mm hmm .
judge joseph dredd .
dredd , you' re under arrest .
what' s the charge ?
murder .
attention .
chief justice fargo now entering maximum security area .
joseph .
sir .
ls it true ?
i' m innocent .
the council is said to have irrefutable proof .
do you believe that ?
there is to be a full tribunal .
a conviction means death .
do you believe that , sir ?
i just needed to look into your eyes for myself .
i' m sorry i asked .
i would never do anything to disgrace you with the council , sir .
i' il use every resource to find out , joseph .
have you selected someone to defend you ?
judge hershey .
hershey ?
why a street judge ?
at the academy , she was at the top of her class in interpretational law .
and i trust her .
the facts will come out at the tribunal .
i' il personally make sure of that .
sir ?
i' m sorry about this .
dredd !
no !
play back .
dredd !
no !
dredd !
no !
play back .
stop video .
the video you have just seen ... is prima facie evidence that the defendant is guilty as charged . mark it people' s exhibit " a .
objection , your honor .
this video is inadmissible as evidence .
lf i may be given a moment to explain ?
please do .
i have an affidavit from nathan olmeyer , currently a junior at the academy .
cadet olmeyer has been acknowledged ... by every one of his instructors to be an expert in digital and video graphics .
his affidavit states this surveillance video is of such low definition , no positive identification can be made of the killer .
your honors , we know that the uniform of a judge can be counterfeit ... and that the badge can be duplicated , and since neither the video nor the audio in this presentation ... can identify the accused in any way ,
i repeat my objection to this video being allowed as evidence in this case , and i ask for a ruling .
objection sustained .
the video is inadmissible .
yes !
shh .
admit it , dredd .
what ?
you' re impressed .
very .
you owe me .
hmm .
very well .
i' m therefore forced to move ... to technical information of a critical nature .
i will need the court' s permission ... to access top secret documentation ... with the help of central computer bank .
you may proceed .
central , are you on line ?
on line , judge mcgruder .
i wish you to access weapons schematic .
describe the working of the standard judge' s side arm , the lawgiver two .
model two is coded to the personal d. n. a .... of the judge using the weapon ... via the skin' s contact with the grip , a fail safe security ..
did you know about this ?
no !
the d. n. a. is obtained from my medical files , and upgraded automatically every time the weapon is reloaded .
each time a round is chambered and fired ... the projectile is tagged with the relevant d. n. a.
chief justice , the defense was not made aware of any of this information .
judge hershey , the prosecution must be given time to finish .
central , were the bullets recovered from the bodies of vardas and lily hammond ... so d. n. a. coded ?
yes , judge mcgruder .
it could not be otherwise .
and what was the result of the computer check ... of the d. n. a. coding on those bullets ?
the d. n. a. is a perfect match for judge joseph dredd .
it' s a lie !
the evidence has been falsified .
it' s impossible !
i never broke the law !
i am the law !
we have no case .
you gotta believe me !
you have to believe me .
say it .
your honor ... the prosecution rests .
the tribunal needs to confer !
what have i done ?
how could i have been so wrong ?
dredd !
both of them homicidal .
only this time it will be impossible to cover up .
chief justice , we carefully buried the janus project nine years ago ... along with rico and all his victims .
no one will ever learn of your involvement .
the media knows how close i am to dredd .
they' il dig until the whole truth comes out .
it' s the perfect excuse to ruin what government we have left .
your motives were pure .
you thought dredd was different .
that' s why you spared him .
a mistake which may bring down the judicial system .
there is a way out , chief justice .
lf you will forgive me .
the long walk .
that' s a death sentence , judge griffin .
mine .
your retirement grants you the power to save dredd' s life !
this gesture ... may also allow janus to remain a secret .
ln the charge of premeditated murder , this tribunal finds joseph dredd ... guilty as charged .
joseph dredd , you' re aware the law allows only one punishment for your crime .
death .
however , it has long been our custom ... to carry out the last order of a retiring senior judge .
and so ...
i step down .
no !
as i leave ... to take my long walk into the cursed earth ,
i ask that this court honor my last order .
be lenient with judge dredd ... in gratitude for his years of service .
we will so honor this one , judge fargo .
dredd , step forward .
the sentence shall be life imprisonment ... at aspen penal colony , to be carried out immediately ... as it is written !
justice griffin , this trial has been a farce !
i demand an appeal !
you will accept the court' s decision , judge hershey !
dredd , i' m so sorry .
i let you down .
you did your best , hershey .
thank you .
let the betrayer of the law ... be taken from our courts .
let his armor be taken from him , and all his garb of justice .
let him be stricken from our hearts and our memory ... forever .
let his name be recorded in every place of honor .
let him take the law he served so well ... to those who have it not .
let him be written ... in our hearts and our memories ... forever .
attention all judges . you are reminded ..
judge hershey .
it' s gotta be here some ..
what' s this ?
baby dredd ?
i can' t believe you were ever a baby .
who' s this ?
chief justice griffin .
it' s got a nice ring to it .
we were supposed to meet someplace safe !
what' s not safe ?
your reporter' s dead , right ?
fargo' s on his walk .
dredd' s in aspen .
so , what' s not safe ?
it' s unfortunate .
hammond had to be silenced .
he found out about janus .
but i could' ve used dredd .
forget dredd !
there is no dredd !
let me tell you what dredd worships .
he worships the law !
he' d have blown you away the minute he found out how much you' re pissin ' on it .
yeah .
let him see what it' s like to freeze his ass off in aspen .
let him see what it' s like to be me !
there' s a lot of work to be done .
janus .
well , where is it ?
you' il see it !
when ?
soon enough !
ln the meantime , i want chaos , rico .
that block war was just the beginning .
now i want fear racing through every street !
and the council will have to turn to me .
and to janus !
you want fear ?
i' m fear .
you want chaos ?
i' m the chaos .
you want a new beginning ?
here !
i am the new beginning !
this is aspen shuttle cf 188 .
due to storm cloud activity over the desert , we will be flying at 60 feet .
flight time approximately four hours .
dredd ?
don' t hit me .
i' m sorry .
i' m sorry .
don' t hurt me .
what are you doing here ?
i was convicted of a crime .
wrongly convicted .
really ?
that' s kinda weird .
what are the odds ?
two wrongly convicted guys sittin ' right next to each other .
you received the sentence the law required .
five years ... just for saving my own ass ?
that was a mistake !
the law doesn' t make mistakes .
really ?
then how do you explain what happened to you ?
you can' t ... can you ?
great ! mr .
i am the law " can' t .
so , maybe , this is some kind of typo .
maybe it' s a glitch .
or maybe it' s poetic justice !
shuttle comin ' !
shuttle !
shuttle !
shuttle comin ' , pa !
look !
praise the lord for bringing us this generous bounty .
my sons ... gather the harvest .
so maybe you' re here as some sort of field trip .
yeah !
maybe this is some sort of ... surprise party .
whoo !
gonna catch me some city boy !
it' s payback time , dredd !
dredd , what' s happening ?
by a blast of god they perish .
and by a breath of his nostrils are they consumed .
hallelujah !
central , i need you to access graphics data base .
i want you to run an l . d. on this man .
scanning for identity . nknown male , approximately 200 centimeters tall , skin tone three . ten , nine , eight ..
central ?
hello ?
this terminal has been terminated from the main system .
your authority has been removed , judge hershey .
this is group leader .
we' ve located the shuttle .
this is capture team .
there' s no sign of dredd .
he appears to have survived the crash .
you are in error , capture team .
no one survived the shuttle wreck .
understand ?
just find dredd !
the pilot , sir .
he' s alive .
no one survived the shuttle wreck !
do i make myself clear ?
yes , sir .
am i dead ?
am i dead ?
i' m dead !
awake !
good !
we' re running out of sinners .
oh , my god !
dredd , do something !
dredd ?
you talk too much .
can it be ?
the great man of the law himself .
o lord , you have blessed us indeed !
judge " rat " dredd .
you creeps are under arrest .
ls that so ?
let me crush him , pa .
excuse me .
we' re not together .
allow me to introduce you to my family .
there' s link , my oldest .
bite me !
hi !
my youngest , junior .
howdy .
hi !
and this here is mean .
we had to make some alterations when he was a child .
the cursed earth' s a tough place on young folks .
i now have him set on one .
i don' t suggest you make him angry .
the legendary angel family .
cursed earth pirates , murderers , scavengers .
and , of course , scumbags .
oh , that' il win ' em over !
did i leave something out , pa ?
let me kill ' im , pa .
i want his ears .
i want his teeth .
does that come with a fork , handsome ?
hallelujah , brother !
wait a minute .
can it be ?
can it be that from the city of the fallen ...
we have one of the faithful ?
amen , brother !
praise the lord !
i' m a believer !
fergie , don' t do it .
it sounds like we have a believer in the gallery .
yes !
cut him down !
go tell it on the mountain !
fergie .
you' re making a big mistake .
well , dredd , maybe the law doesn' t make mistakes , but i' m free and you' re toast .
actually , you' re toast .
i forgot to mention it .
your new friends , they' re cannibals .
fresh meat .
prepare the supplicant for sacrifice .
no , wait .
you can' t eat me !
i' ve got eczema .
i' ve got warts .
i' ve had gonorrhea .

lilegal use of city electricity .
how do you plead ?
i knew you' d say that !
graphics analysis now .
olmeyer , you stupid futz !
i can' t ..
you analyzed the wrong viewie , all right .
the wrong one .
this one !
i don' t believe it .
you just wasted three hours .
lf this is the wrong picture ,
why is it fake ?
what ?
look .
it' s full of anomalies .
really clever ones too .
somebody must' ve used a c. g. l . terminal and a scan quad to make this .
this is state of the art ... twenty years ago .
are you saying this isn' t real ?
yeah .
look , i' il drop out all the artificial pixels .
dad .
mom .
foreground .
background .
all fake .
the only thing that' s real is the baby .
oh .
the blind lady .
who is she ?
justice ... before your time .
we should never have taken justice out of her hands .
you brought order to chaos , sir .
that we did .
solved many problems , and created many more !
being a judge , joseph , perhaps too much power in one person' s hands .
we once tried to compensate : create the perfect judge .
we called it janus .
four decades ago ,
d. n. a. samples were taken from the original council .
one was chosen .
mine .
we altered it to enhance the best qualities ... and screen out the worst : weaknesses , frailties .
we created you .
you didn' t create me , sir .
i have a family .
no .
at the academy , you told me they were killed when i was very young .
a lie .
i have a picture of them .
a fake .
we lied ... to both of you .
both ?
there was another infant created in that experiment , but something went wrong .
genetically mutated to the perfect criminal .
i have a brother ?
you were best friends at the academy .
star pupils .
and then he turned .
and for his crimes , you judged him .
rico ?
rico .
you let me judge my own brother ?
you never told me , sir .
i couldn' t !
you were like a son to me !
a son .
my whole life is a lie .
rico had to be executed to protect you , to protect the city .
rico .
rico .
he' s alive !
no .
i signed the order myself .
i saw the report .
i didn' t kill hammond .
it was him .
it was his d. n. a. that convicted me .
griffin .
hmph .
it was griffin .
griffin , yes .
we' ve both been deceived , joseph .
i' m so sorry .
rico' s killed me and destroyed you ! fi .. find him , joseph .
don' t die .
what do we do ?
what do we do ?
find rico .
welcome to janus .
rico , i think you know dr. hayden .
i remember you .
testified before the council that i was insane , right ?
and therefore innocent .
i was trying to save your life .
what you did was insult me , ' cause i knew exactly what i was doing .
then and now .
miss hayden has been a loyal supporter of this project for a long time .
she' s kept it alive for me .
i' m sure you' il find her expertise invaluable .
excuse me !
all this is useless if you can' t get into central' s janus files ,
' cause the council has ' em locked .
leave that to me .
meanwhile you have work to do ... on the streets .
llsa will help you .
i don' t need no help !
thanks .
i thought you said he was created here by the finest scientists of mega city .
a bold experiment .
he' s a petulant child .
let' s not bicker .
we' re here to achieve the same thing .
an ordered society .
you' il have your new order .
attention , all judges .
reporting unrest , code d 924 .
downtown , sector 12 .
backup requested .
nineteen different explosions in 11 different sectors .
extra caution to be taken on approach to 914 ..
search all areas bordering the elite building .
the anonymous caller did not specify capacity .
proceed with caution .
my boy !
dredd , there' s no way in !
hello ?
are you even listening to me ?
we can' t just knock on the wall and say , " hello , cursed earth pizza .
there is a way in .
six years ago , two refugees figured it out .
it' s a vent to the city' s incinerator .
there' s a burst twice a minute .
that means somebody could run through that tube ... and have 30 seconds before it flames again .
and these , these refugees , they made it through , right ?
actually , they were roasted .
but the theory' s sound .
shall we ?
maybe we should consider other theories .
dredd !
dispatch , i' m in green quad 411 .
need a pickup .
copy , hershey .
i have central on line for you .
patch it to my lawmaster .
warning .
alien device on board .
oh , my god !
96 judges have been assassinated !
whoever' s doing this seems to know all our procedures , our security measures , even our scrambled frequencies .
with no judges on the street , riots are breaking out all over mega city .
we can' t replace those judges .
even if we put the cadets on the street , we won' t be at full strength for years !
there is a solution .
project janus .
this council tried to play god once before .
lf this wholesale slaughter of judges continues , there won' t be a council .
janus could ..
janus could what ?
a new batch of test tube babies won' t solve this crisis .
we don' t need reliable judges 20 years from now , we need them today !
accelerated growth incubators are more developed now .
we could create adult subjects .
all i' m asking is that we unlock the janus files .
that way we at least have an option !
lf the council decides not to go forward ,
i' il accept that decision ... and resign .
all right , you ready , kid ?
no !
now what' s wrong ?
what' s wrong ?
are you kidding ?
did wearing that helmet all those years compress your brain ?
you' re gonna get me killed .
there' s a maniac loose in this city !
what a coincidence !
there' s one out here too !
oh .
great time i' m having .
the shuttle crash , the cursed earth , cannibals .
and now a fireball up my ass !
this is all your fault !
my fault ?
yes !
you care to explain that , citizen ?
lf you hadn' t arrested me , i wouldn' t be here in the first place .
hey , dredd , what if you just kill me now ?
that' s it !
i' m through schlepping .
i' m gonna stay here until i' m caught or ' til you apologize !
the law can' t apologize !
you' re not the law anymore .
now apologize .
i think i deserve that .
i' ve never apologized .
now run !
thirty , twenty nine , twenty eight ,
twenty seven , twenty six , run ! twenty five , twenty four , twenty three , twenty two , twenty one , nineteen ..
dredd ?
dredd !
dredd !
i don' t wanna die !
jump !
i' m alive !
i' m alive !
oh ... so are you .

attention . ntil emergency repairs are completed , ward " c " locker room is off limits .
psst .
i' m lost .
ls this the bathroom ?
hey !
now you have to admit , i helped out on that one .
i mean , that was all me , baby ! hey , hey , wh .. why are you taking off his clothes ?
we don' t have time for this .
central , using current technology , how long would it take for janus to produce a fully grown adult subject ?
given the current state of genetic engineering , an adult subject could be incubated in approximately eight hours .
we could replace our losses in a day .
this is madness .
ah , dredd ?
silence .
dredd !
shh .
i' m busy .
dredd ?
it' s inhuman .
it' s not for this council to play god !
no , griffin .
please restore the security blocks .
it seems none of you have the force of will that these times require .
central , leave janus unlocked .
griffin , this is treason .
you have just sealed your fate .
no !
you have just sealed yours !
rico !
now who says politics is boring ?
hey , dredd !
i thought it was you .
that' s right !
cover your ears !
rico .
joseph .
get out of here ... now !
no !
you' re under arrest , griffin .
really ?
stop him !
he just killed the entire council !
move it out !
dredd , tell them i' m innocent .
come on , fergie !
run !
you' re a lot of fun to be with , dredd .
you know that ?
what are you gonna do ?
hope it works .
what is wrong with this piece of shit ?
that' s a solid brick wall !
you' re going to kill us !
dredd !
you gotta make it work !
make it work !
malfunction .
malfunction .
on line .
dredd , you may want to wash this seat after we get off the bike .
hmm .
sorry .
dredd , move it !
fergie , cover the rear .
i' ve never fired a gun in my life !
what kind of a criminal are you ?
a nice criminal .
nothing' s happening !
you gotta cock it first , moron .
you didn' t say anything about cocking .
nice !
stop !
please , god !
you can drop me off here .
dredd , that' s a dead end .
i know .
oh , god !
fergie , take over !
where are you going ?
dredd !
this is where you get off , creep !
need a lift , kid ?
i' m never riding with you again , dredd !
she' s definitely not gonna get her cleaning deposit back , that' s for sure .
it doesn' t pay to be one of your friends , dredd .
sorry !
hands against the wall .
you know the drill .
who are you ?
dredd said that ..
shut up !
what happened ?
why don' t you tell me , dredd , huh ?
we' re dyin ' out there !
108 judges in 48 hours !
what the hell is going on ?
you think i' m part of this ?
i don' t know who or what you are anymore .
i would never do anything to hurt you , hersh .
you know that .
all right .
you tell me about him , huh ?
you make me believe in you like i did when i defended you .
his name is rico ... and he' s my brother .
the d. n. a. sample has been taken out of frozen stasis .
ready for cloning process .
we got a slight change of plans here .
i want to take the existing d. n. a. sample right now and trash it .
activate this d. n. a. sampling console .
what are you doing ?
central , take ... this d. n. a. sample now .
this wasn' t part of our plan !
judge griffin would never have authorized this !
processing .
you know , griffin got to be my keeper by puttin ' me behind bars .
what' s your excuse ?
you said i had no feelings and no emotions .
now you know why .
dredd ... look at me .
the janus project didn' t do that to you .
you did that to yourself .
sorry , guys , i' m getting nowhere with your terminal .
but i fixed the microwave .
you want some popcorn ?
ls this a bad time ?
look , i tried dialing everything i could think of to find this janus thing .
it just isn' t in the program .
nowhere .
nothing .
they' d never take a chance and put it on the computer network ... but they need power and they' re gonna steal it from somewhere .
check every sector for recent blackouts and sudden power surges .
great .
let' s stay here longer !
wait a second .
just before they blew up my lawmaster in sector four , there was a power surge , a really big one , three blocks wide .
the last time i felt something like that , they shut down the whole power grid in that area , remember ?
when they moved the statue of liberty , they put it right down on top of it .
right .
could we go now ?
dredd ... that' s twice you owe me .
rico !
dredd got away from the hunters .
well , he' s about to be seriously outnumbered .
right , central ?
affirmative , judge rico .
the new d. n. a. sample has been multiplexed , and the gametes are already dividing .
new sample ?
you left that d. n. a. in there for over 30 years !
sooner or later , somebody' s gonna clean out the fridge .
that sample was created from the finest specimens on the council of judges !
what did you replace it with ?
no .
my god .
you should congratulate me right now , ' cause i' m about to be a daddy .
you' re being very , very rude .
you don' t know what you' re doing !
the next batch of janus judges are not going to be the puppets that you want !
they' re gonna be my brothers and sisters !
and mine to control !
i can' t let you do this . you' re both insane !
i have to stop ..
central ... help me !
i' m sorry , chief justice , the a. b. c. robot ... is not tied into my main processor .
that' s right , griff .
you gotta get with this high tech stuff .
robot , rip his arms and legs off .
no !
and you save his head for last .
i don' t want him to miss anything !
anything !
no !
fergie , you stay here .
by myself ?
you' il need me to shut down the janus system .
we' re a team .
granted , you do most of the work , but we' re still a team .
i' il handle it , kid .
i bring you luck .
luck ?
you are still alive , dredd .
hmm .
i' m getting a signal .
it' s close .
it' s moving closer !
jesus christ !
get back !
no !
dredd !
drop the gun .
robot , on the count of three , break her neck . one , two ..
no !
hershey ?
i' m still here .
how romantic .
step inside .
he looks a lot like you .
he looks a lot like you .
he is a lot like me .
i am nothing like you .
the only difference between us , joseph , is you destroyed your life ... to embrace the law .
and i destroyed the law ... to embrace life .
and speaking of life , send in the clones .
behold !
this is where you were born .
feel that magic ?
but you must' ve known all along ... you were different .
fergie ... are you still alive ?
technically ... yes .
your brothers and your sisters .
be born in two hours .
one big , endless supply of perfection .
you know , we have a choice .
we can stand here right now ... and create a whole race of brainwashed morons , and call them judges .
or we can create some freethinking people .
we' il call them human .
human .
you could never control yourself .
what makes you think you can control ... these things ?
' cause you' re in control .
you be head of the council .
you choose , and you choose quickly too .
i should' ve put you down myself ... personally !
you know , i never understood that .
why did you judge me ?
why did you judge me ?
you killed innocent people .
the means to an end .
you started a massacre .
i caused a revolution .
you betrayed the law !
law !
i betrayed this !
your council' s experiment , which failed in you !
i was your brother , your blood , your friend .
who betrayed who ?
when are you gonna stop being a goddamn slave and grow up ?
that' s your birthright , that' s your family .
i' m your family .
i' m the only family you ever had !
now choose !
the best thing you can do is kill me .
why ?
because it' s your only chance ... brother .
fido !
rip this bitch' s arms and legs off .
save her pretty head for my brother .
don' t do it !
halt !
rip his head off instead .
give it to her .
what' s the matter with you ?
rico !
boy , is he pissed !
fergie !
dredd !
get him , dredd !
hang on , fergie .
hack you , asshole .
rico !
central , hatch that first set of clones .
the cloning process is not finished , judge rico .
the clones will be only 60/ o complete .
i need reinforcements .
hatch the goddamn clones now !
don' t fight much , do you ?
bitch !
it' s judge bitch !
i' m the only one who never lied to you .
i' il be the judge of that .
now , joseph dredd , i hereby judge you .
to the charge of betraying your flesh ... guilty .
to the charge of being human , when we could have been gods ... guilty .
the sentence is death .
don' t miss .
lethal round is exhausted .
signal flare !
court is adjourned .
dredd .
give me your hand .
that' s three times now , dredd .
stay in back , hershey .
am i under arrest ?
that won' t be necessary .
central broadcast the janus plan after griffin' s death .
they all know the truth .
judge dredd , we have to reconstitute the council .
we' d like you to consider the first position of chief justice .
i' m a street judge .
and i' m very late for work .
thank you , olmeyer .
i am dying .
i' m too young .. excuse me .
oh , that' s great !
he gets all the credit .
dredd ?
i taught him everything he knows .
dredd , that' s it ?
no good bye ?
good bye , hershey .
to tell you the truth , i' m probably a much better kisser .
ow !
okay , come on , let' s go , will ya ?
can we swing by a cash machine ?
feels good to be human , don' t you think ?
i knew you' d say that .
