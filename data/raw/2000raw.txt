it stopped .
what' s that , dave ?
nothing .
how we doing ?
oh , we' re ready .
you feeling the magic ?
oh , i' m feeling the magic , all right .
let' s hit ' em .
yeah .
let' s do it .
here we go .
let' s hit ' em .
let' s go make $30 million .
good morning .
before i begin , let me ...
david ?
i' il go get help .
jesus .
jesus , david .
phone 9 1 1 .
phone 9 1 1 !
david ?
nick ?
vicky ? !
vicky !
okay , it' s okay .
it' s okay .
everybody else off the bus .
sound waves .
so , if we know that sound waves gain wavelength and lose frequency as they travel through more dense materials ... ... then the anomalies in these waves are the means by which we can surmise the fundamental architecture of our planet .
how are the nails coming , christine ?
good .
all right , let' s have a demonstration .
mr. acker , veronica .
thank you very much .
all right .
mrs. limestone , being a big softie , you know ,
loves walks in the park , bedtime stories , big romantic .
loves chet .
i can' t play chet , but i' il see what i can do .
watch the oscilloscope , all right ?
here we go .
dr. joshua keyes ?
maybe .
yes or no , sir ?
the first one .
please come with us , sir .
guys , wh what' s going on ?
we don' t know , sir .
what do you mean , you don' t know ?
your security clearance is higher than ours .
i have security clearance ?
we' re just here to bring you to your jet .
i have a jet ?
hey , serge .
ah !
serge .
serge .
damn !
it' s about time .
you' re always late .
let' s keep moving , gentlemen .
what am i doing here ?
they wouldn' t brief me until you got here .
you know , there are biochemists everywhere , military .
i hate them .
when are you going to meet a nice girl and bring her for dinner ?
i' m married to my work .
so am l .
which makes my wife my mistress ... that' s why i' m still in love with her .
you were always a romantic .
i love my wife .
yeah , i know .
i love your wife , too .
i know .
but i don' t love your wife .
you know what i mean .
you don' t love her the same way , you know .
it' s the french .
i think it' s the cheese .
ah , the cheese .
you' re ... you' re teasing me , right ?
oh , my ... !
whoa .
wait , these are bodies .
i think we' re in the wrong place here .
yeah , we' re in the wrong place .
no . lf you were in the wrong place , you would' ve already been shot .
that' s a hell of a greeting .
serge .
serge .
serge .
yes .
always a pleasure .
same here , thomas .
dr. keyes .
i know .
tom purcell .
gentlemen , you do realize that everything here is totally classified , okay ?
at 10 : 30 a . m . local time , 32 civilians , all within a 10 block radius ... died .
they didn' t get sick first .
they simply hit the ground dead .
nerve agent ?
our first guess .
no .
they all died at the same time ?
as far as we can tell , to the second .
this hits cnn in one hour .
i need a reason .
ls there a variation in sex , age , body type ?
they all had pacemakers .
under a minute .
your reputation is well deserved .
hey , hey , hey .
how did you guess ?
without any clues from the victims ?
no , that' s ...
serge and i are the clues .
i mean , he specializes in high energy weapons .
i do geomagnetics .
so calling us means you suspect an electromagnetic pulse weapon .
lf these are the only fatalities , they must be people susceptible to ... electronic interference .
qed pacemakers .
you' re spooky sometimes , eh ?
now i need to know , did some sort of weapon kill these people ?
the power that you would need to create an em pulse strong enough ...
i mean , that' s ... that' s not a weapon that
i' ve ever heard of .
no .
okay , we' re done .
we' re not done , sir .
there' s nothing on the other side of the equal sign .
i agree with joshua ...
thank you .
our greatest concern was this may have been an act of war , but since it' s not ,
i think we can all breathe a little easier , can' t we ?
look at my hat .
what is it , sweetheart ?
it' s okay , son .
these things happen all the time and ...
let' s , go , let' s go !
come on !
justin !
watch out , you bloody idiot !
hurry !
run !
daddy !
the skies are empty over nelson' s column now , but a few hours ago , it was a different story .
eyewitnesses claimed that the frenzied swarms of birds were not in fact attacking people deliberately ...
and it' s not just this time .
no , no , no , no , no , no . but seemed to be confused and flying blind .
the fortean times reported violent bird swarms twice last month in australia and japan .
five people are confirmed dead and dozens injured in the panic that followed the bizarre and terrifying incident in london' s historic trafalgar square .
weird .
mm hmm .
quite strange , also .
mm .
strange , indeed .
mm !
how do birds navigate ?
by sight ?
no , no , no , the long range stuff .
magnetic fields .
little ions in their brains align with the magnetic field of the earth .
yeah , what she said .
right ?
acker .
hit the ' net , do a search for ... oh , two years ought to do it .
any and all , like , " weird news " , you know ... bizarre animal migrations , specifically birds .
whale and dolphin beachings .
unusual atmospheric phenomenon , unexplained plane crashes , you know , just use your imagination .
that is a huge search .
you can use our t 1 line to look up sailor moon crap .
you' re up to this .
danni , danni , get me the brightest kids from the field theory class , and design a computer model of an electromagnetic field .
what are we doing ?
i need a 3 d computer model of the earth to lay the field over .
whoa ho ho , the planet earth ?
yeah , the planet earth .
you know , the pretty blue one .
map out the anomalies that acker finds and grunt out the equations .
and , uh ... grab those smelly kids from the non linear diff class , too .
listen , josh , do we even have time for this ?
do this and i' il sign your doctorates blindfolded .
blindfolded ?
blindfolded .
do not pass go .
go directly to phd .
be wrong .
be wrong .
tim , i' m coming in a little hot .
give me some drag , will you ?
roger that .
we are in attitude and ready for an entry interface .
nice work , major .
i have the controls now for e. l .
i could take us in .
you could ... but you won' t .
i' m ready for this , bob .
oh , no , you' re not , beck .
you' re trained , and you' re certified doesn' t make you the commander .
and the commander lands the bird .
you got to be the youngest person ever in space .
you should say , thank you , be happy .
now .
endeavour , houston , at this time we show you go for reentry .
houston , endeavour descending through 400, 000 feet coming upon entry interface .
endeavour , this is flight .
weren' t able to annoy the commander into letting you bring her in this time ?
that' s a negative , stick .
i' il have to be more annoying next time .
ls that even possible ?
endeavour , we see you in good entry config .
roger , houston .
advise .
i' m seeing those plasma trails now .
all right , mark 241 .
so , a minute to air .
i don' t believe in belts .
just get me through the earth' s atmosphere in this spaceship .
com dropout .
start the i com .
let' s wait till the ...
com restored .
quiet !
we are out of position here .
guidance shows us on energy and on course .
well , i' ve made this approach 213 times in the simulator .
we' re not where we should be .
where the hell are we ?
endeavour , guidance is bad .
you are now 1 2 niner miles off course .
roger , houston .
we sort of noticed .
ls that ... ?
los angeles .
that is confirmed .
we are 1 5 thousand feet .
we got maybe two minutes of glide time left .
doesn' t make sense .
the guidance , the beacons are all wrong ?
we' re heading straight for downtown .
we' re not going to crash into los angeles .
they' re going to hit downtown l. a. at 300 knots .
bob , you know l. a. ?
because i have an idea .
houston , those buildings are getting mighty big .
can you clear a freeway ?
okay , thank you .
come on .
come on .
it' s rush hour , commander , and it' s bumper to bumper .
sir , i have an alternate .
lf you turn to heading 1 7 5 ...
it' s houston' s call .
houston ?
computers are still plotting .
come on .
houston , we are running out of time here .
sir , i have an alternate .
all right , beck , what do you got ?
houston , i have coordinates for an alternate landing site .
can you confirm ?
endeavour , give them to me .
i show possible touchdown ... at 33 . 55 north , 1 18 . 10 west .
bill ?
it' s theoretically possible .
endeavour , that is confirmed .
turn right , heading 1 7 5 .
expect visual contact with los angeles river in five seconds .
no , that will not work , houston .
we got bridges every few hundred yards .
our wingspan alone is going to fold us up .
i' ve figured the " l " over " d " max .
we can make it if you can bring us straight in .
we' re coming in high and hot .
290 feet , 320 .
270 , 3 0 5 ...
arm the gear .
you' re armed .
gear down .
now .
gear in transition .
240 feet , 290 .
hang on .
this isn' t going to be subtle .
210 feet , 265 .
get out of the way !
move !
derotate .
lnward .
230 ... 210 ...
speed brakes !
100 % .
oh , we' re way too fast .
deploy the chute .
no .
we' d snag the bridge .
we' il tear the tail off .
banking right .
commander , that next bridge !
watch it !
we' re way too high for that one !
suck up the gear !
not yet .
we' il lose all steering .
we hit , it' s over !
and ... gear up now !
lock your harnesses .
this is out of my hands .
let' s get out of here !
run !
let' s get out !
dr. zimsky ? !
will you make sure my assistant has your number , darling ?
sure .
dr. zimsky !
hello .
i' il call security .
no , it' s all right .
it' s all right .
hello .
thank you , sir .
dr. zimsky .
yes .
what' s your name ?
josh keyes .
josh .
no , sir , i don' t need you to sign it .
i need you to read that .
i' m sorry , i don' t have time .
i' m late for the white house .
sir , please .
i need you to confirm my results , sir .
young man , do you have any idea who i am ?
yes , i do , sir .
please read this .
what' s it about ?
it' s the end of the world .
no , i ... this is impossible .
i' m sorry .
l l i can' t have missed this .
you you have to be wrong .
i mean , look , i' m sure with careful comparison to my own work , we' il find that you are mistaken .
no offense , but ...
well , i mean , we' il know soon enough .
the bigger effects will start up any day now .
rebecca ?
only you and dad ever call me that .
well , beck .
so , what brings you to sunny d. c. ?
the board of review is next week .
just trying to get a sense of the mood upstairs .
how bad is it ?
your crew crashed the space shuttle .
now , how good do you think it could be ?
sir , this is my life .
well ...
i was studying for the academy when i was 13 .
it still is and has always been my life .
it' s over .
it' s over , rebecca .
i' m sorry .
it' s right down here .
really ?
it' s like the 4th of july .
what the hell' s the hurry here ?
rebecca , would you excuse me , please ?
excuse me .
purcell .
thomas , um , look ... it seems that destiny may have caught up with us .
did zimsky really try to give you his autograph ?
ah , monsieur zimsky .
conrad zimsky .
herr zimsky .
superstar .
oh ...
i think i skipped drunk .
went right to hangover .
weren' t you the one ?
i spoke with the kids .
they don' t sleep at night .
they look at the sky , and ... and they think it' s pretty .
ls there any chance you' re wrong ?
no .
the sky , man .
the sky i mean , that' s just the beginning .
that' s high altitude static discharge .
i know .
dr. keyes ... ... your presence is required at the pentagon .
ah ... it' s my best buddies .
hey !
why don' t you join us for a drink ?
we' d be grateful if you could join us for a ride , sir .
and if i were to say no ?
just asking .
yeah .
well , we have no sense of humor .
that' s true .
oh ...
and we' re armed .
thank you .
dr. keyes , welcome .
thank you .
dr. zimsky informs us that you made a useful contribution to his investigations , so he wanted you to assist him in the briefing .
that' s very generous of you , dr. zimsky .
science is a selfless business , dear boy .
now , why don' t you begin , and i' il fill in all the difficult bits .
all right , i' il put this as simply as i can .
everybody on earth is dead in a year .
and let me explain why .
wrapped around the earth is an invisible field of energy .
it' s made up of ... electricity and magnetism , so it' s called creatively enough the electromagnetic field .
it' s where we get our magnetic north pole and south pole , and it protects us from cosmic radiation .
so this em field is our friend .
but now ... ?
but now , that field is falling apart .
why ?
why ?
this here .
does somebody have a can of air freshener ?
quick and dirty .
the thin skin , that' s the earth' s crust .
that' s what we live on .
it' s 30 miles thick .
the meat here , call it the mantle .
and forgetting all the the funky transitions , it' s 2, 000 miles thick .
the core , the peach pit in the center ... that' s a tricky one .
there' s two parts the inner core and the outer core .
are you following me ?
the inner core is , uh ... well , it' s a big , solid chunk of iron , we think .
and that' s surrounded by the outer core , and that is liquid .
yes , but , most importantly , this liquid is constantly spinning in one direction .
so a trillion trillion tons of hot metal spinning at a thousand miles an hour , so ...
right , so physics 101 hot metal moving fast makes an electromagnetic field .
this spinning liquid outer core is the engine that drives the em field .
and that' s where we have our problem .
this engine has stalled .
the core of the earth has stopped spinning .
how could this have happened ?
we don' t know .
what' s the timeline here ?
as the em field becomes more and more unstable , we' il start seeing isolated incidents .
one plane will fall from the sky , and then two , and then ... in a few months , anything ... everything electronic will be fried .
static discharges in the atmosphere will create " super storms " with hundreds of lightening strikes per square mile .
after that , it gets bad .
the earth' s em field shields us from the solar winds , which are a lethal blend of radioactive particles and microwaves .
when that shield collapses , microwave radiation will literally cook our planet .
dr. zimsky .
this is the sun .
this is the earth ... without the em field .
would you ?
mm hmm .
three months , gentlemen , and we' re back in the stone age .
a full year , the field collapses ... and that .
may l ?
feel free to throw up .
i know i did .
so , how do we fix it ?
we can' t .
not in my vocabulary .
then you might want to get one of those
word a day calendars , general , because it' s impossible .
the core is the size of mars .
you' re talking about jump starting a planet .
this is a superheated hyper fluid of molten iron and nickel at 9, 000 degrees fahrenheit , 2, 000 miles down , 1 , 000 miles thick .
and the deepest we' ve ever been is ... seven miles with a two inch drill bit .
lf we can go into space , we certainly ...
well , space is easy .
it' s empty .
we' re talking about millions of pounds of pressure per square inch .
even if we somehow came up with a brilliant plan to fix the core , we just can' t get there .
yes , but ...
... what if we could ?
hello , braz .
why the hell aren' t you dead yet ?
okay , this way .
well , that went better than i expected .
dr. brazzleton ,
i see you know dr. zimsky .
yeah .
20 years ago , he stole my research .
after that , we we kind of lost touch .
research that was equally mine .
that' s funny , i don' t remember a check from any of the patents .
all right , braz .
20 years in the desert makes you a prophet and a martyr .
look , we' re here about your legendary ship .
okay , i' m combining high frequency pulse lasers with resonance tube ultrasonics .
lf you' ve ever seen ultrasonic waves break up a kidney stone on the discovery channel , it' s the same deal here .
you can ... put your helmets on now .
firing .
woo ooh !
woo hoo !
yeah .
oh .
okay , i' m officially impressed .
so , all right .
so you' ve made some progress with the engine , we' il grant you .
have you begun to think about a shell ?
okay , this is alex .
okay , alex .
good .
okay , here we have a concrete block , and in back of that , we have a two inch steel plate .
okay .
we' re ready .
and we are ... firing .
voila !
that' s ...
that' s impossible .
i combined the crystals in a tungsten titanium matrix at supercool temperatures , and that' s what did the trick .
the applications for this are just ...
what do you call this material ?
well , its real name has 37 syilables .
i call it unobtainium .
unobtainium ?
mm hmm .
the unobtainium will take the heat and the pressure and transform it to energy , which in turn , reinforces the shell of the ship , you see .
so the hotter and the deeper she gets , the stronger she gets ... theoretically .
theoretically ?
theoretically , yes .
this ... is johnson , don' t mind him .
this is the prototype for the cockpit here .
excuse me , dr. brazzleton , when do you think the ship will be operational ?
when i get my fabrication methods perfected ... 12 ... ten years , ten years .
what would it take to get it done in three months ?
$15 billion .
i ...
will you take a check ?
why don' t you use a credit card ?
you get miles .
mm .
shit !
mr. finch , this is the fbl .
we have a warrant .
purge !
come on , purge !
fbl !
freeze !
okay .
i know these look like computers .
totally not .
theodore donald finch .
carnegie mellon university .
m. l . t.
worked at the sun , lucent , rand corp.
my handle' s " rat .
call me rat .
63 computer fraud indictments .
64 .
two convictions .
this is strike three , mr. finch .
wait a second .
you guys aren' t here to whack me , are you ?
because i was really , really hoping to have sex before that happened .
yeah .
i' ve been told by the fbl whose database you crippled last year that you are the best in the business .
so you' re about to be given a choice .
what if i say no ?
excuse me , but is this really the best we could do ?
i mean ...
how many languages do you speak ?
five , actually .
well , i speak one .
one , zero , one , zero , zero .
with that , i could steal your money , your secrets , your sexual fantasies , your whole life , any country , any place , anytime i want .
we multitask like you breathe .
i couldn' t think as slow as you if i tried .
do you have any idea ... ?
okay , hey .
hey !
let' s just , let' s give the kid a break .
okay , it' s a phone .
it' s just a phone .
rat , we got a big problem .
a lot of people are going to die .
we need your help .
what kind of help ?
lnformation control .
we need you to control the flow of information on the lnternet .
you' re dreaming .
nobody controls the ' net .
could you ... with unlimited resources ?
you want me to hack the planet ?
he wants me to hack the planet .
you' ve got free long distance on that phone ... forever .
okay .
lf i decide to do this ...
i' m going to need an unlimited supply of xena tapes and hot pockets .
hot pockets ?
they help me concentrate .
sounds fair .
major childs , they' re ready for you .
you and you alone were responsible for proposing the descent vectors for the shuttle , correct ?
yes , general .
we have determined that the class " a " landing mishap experienced by the shuttle endeavour was caused by biased navigational data from the ground due to a brief geomagnetic disturbance .
major childs , the resourcefulness you showed in determining the descent vectors proved that you have exceptional navigation skills .
you' ve brought much credit upon yourself , the space program and the united states air force .
congratulations , major .
you are reassigned with commander lverson and flight director stickley to a new mission effective immediately .
transportation is waiting outside .
good luck and godspeed , major .
are you sure you want to wear this tie ?
why ?
i don' t know .
i mean , you look so nervous about it .
you look so ...
so , how are you holding up ?
oh , hi .
i' m good , i' m good .
i' m about to tell a couple hundred people the world is going to end .
well ...
i' ve had better days .
you look good .
well , no , you don' t look good .
why did he touch his tie like that ?
thomas , let me speak with you for a moment .
listen , wouldn' t you rather i did this ?
i mean , given my reputation , i think that ...
no .
no , keyes is in the lead here , zimsky .
yes .
thomas , this is the most important scientific operation in history .
and given my status , i feel that it' s my job to present ...
project destiny was your job , zimsky .
and you went way beyond authorized limits .
and let me tell ...
and let me tell you ,
i still , i want to know if destiny caused this problem .
it' s highly unlikely , but it may be the solution .
now , i have not finished checking ...
excuse me .
rebecca ...
i' m so glad i was wrong .
right over left ...
no , the other left , the other left .
gentlemen .
and then you ...
gentlemen .
dr. brazzleton knows the ship ;
hello .
dr. zimsky knows the planet ;
doctor .
dr. leveque knows the weapons system ;
excuse me , ladies first .
hi .
and dr. keyes ...
dr. keyes built the navigation system , so ...
hi .
rebecca childs .
bob lverson .
these are your fellow ... fellow ... what ?
terranauts ?
hello .
all this brain power over here is starting to smell like burning batteries .
y' all better come and join in .
yeah .
it' s the simplest things that are the hardest , huh ?
yeah .
it' s official .
i' m the least qualified person on this base .
dr. keyes , i' m sure the people in charge have every confidence in you .
well , the problem is that i' m in charge .
yeah , i know .
can i help you ?
yes , please .
you' re an astronaut , and you can tie a windsor ?
mm hmm .
ls there anything you can' t do ?
not that i' m aware of .
i find that incredibly intimidating .
yep .
most people do .
here .
thank you .
you' re welcome .
let me introduce our project leader , dr. joshua keyes .
thank you , thank you .
good evening .
good evening .
wow .
this looks like a meeting for nobel prize winners anonymous .
i know you are all the finest in your fields and have come a long way to be here .
so , i' il outline our program over the next three months .
dr. brazzleton will supervise the building of a ship which is capable of reaching the center of our planet .
once there , it will deliver an explosive charge
large enough to restart its core .
dr. zimsky will calculate the scale of the explosion needed .
this is a program i designed to simulate the effect of nuclear detonations on the core .
lf my calculations are correct , a tiny nudge in any direction will force the core back into its normal flow .
what' s a " tiny nudge " in planetary terms ?
a thousand megatons , give or take ?
tops .
because any more than that would create a core instability .
we made a few monster warheads in the 200 megaton range .
braz , do you think the ship can handle five of these babies ?
yeah .
i can enlarge the ejection pod ...
forgive me , but , you know , i know i' m not the expert here , but what if the core is thicker or thinner ?
i mean , what if it' s not what you think it is ?
lsn' t that going to affect the way the explosions are ... ?
yes , yes , yes , yes .
and what if the core is made of cheese ?
this is all best guess , commander .
that' s all science is , is best guess .
so my best guess is you don' t know .
with luck , irony will break for the good guys for once , and the world' s biggest weapons of mass destruction will help save the world .
the ship will be powered by a small experimental nuclear reactor .
it will be divided into six compartments
like cars on a train : the locomotive unit , navigation compartment ,
living quarters , engineering , bomb compartment and finally the weapons control module .
up to a 45 degree angle , every compartment will be held level by these gyro control gimbals .
but if we do breach a section , bulkhead doors engage automatically , seal off the section in red , and eject .
ls ejection really the best option ?
only option .
each damaged compartment degrades the entire hull .
the objective is simple .
the obstacles are gigantic .
we' re going to need all the help in the world , but if we are to avoid panic and chaos , the world at large can never know what' s happening here .
which is where our friend mr. rat comes in .
it' s called virus bot .
it' s a computer virus that will seek out files anywhere on the web that contain keywords that we designate and wipes them out .
this is my kung fu , and it is strong .
meanwhile , there are a million puzzles ahead of us , and we have three months to solve them .
we have a committed and ingenious team .
we have every resource available to us , and we have the best of the world' s scientific and technical talents on our side .
with your help we can , we must ... succeed .
feedback in the resonance tube .
talk to me , gentlemen .
we are losing structural integrity .
no , it' s not feedback .
it' s an impeller malfunction , i believe .
no , it' s not , no . lf it were an impeller malfunction ...
for god' s sakes , braz , make the call !
no , i' il make the call .
i should make the call .
65 knots .
depth , 8 5 thousand feet .
look , guys ...
it' s a disaster !
what part of " talk to me " don' t you guys understand ?
for the 22nd time in a row , everyone on earth is dead .
let' s take a little quiet time , and you all are going to try this again .
hi .
hi .
what is this ?
well , it' s ...
i invented it .
it' s how you' re going to ... going to steer underground .
it' s , um ... not very good reception .
well , you' re looking through three feet of lead at 50 yards away , so ... it ain' t bad .
it' s like a cat scan at a hospital , but it' s it' s souped up .
i invented it for deep earth surveying .
and then the government came in , bought my research , paid off my student loan guys and made me a consultant .
i' m sorry , this is really delicate . and i have it just the way i want it .
so ... excuse me .
uh , yeah .
then they brought me in when the pacemakers quit , and ... boom you know , i' m apocalypse boy .
apocalypse boy ?
yeah .
i' m having t shirts made up .
well , hats sell better .
you know , it' s funny , because that is ... right where it should be .
well ...
i' m sorry .
i' m a little ragged around the edges .
i' m just trying to get this thing to focus correctly .
this is really cool , but can i just ... ?
well ... mm hmm .
it' s better .
it' s better .
uh ...
god , i hate this sky .
crashing one ship isn' t enough for you ?
hey .
practice makes perfect .
you can practice all you like .
it doesn' t mean you' re ready to sit in that seat .
so you keep reminding me , sir .
you know , i doubt you' re even going to listen to this , but i' m going to give it a shot .
being a leader isn' t about ability .
it' s about responsibility .
got it , sir .
no , you don' t , beck .
i mean , you' re not just responsible for making good decisions .
you have to be responsible for the bad ones .
you got to be ready to make the shitty call .
what makes you think i' m not ?
because you' re so good .
you haven' t hit anything you couldn' t beat .
i mean , hell , you were the one who figured out how to save the shuttle .
you made me , you made the rest of nasa just look like an ass .
it' s just that you' re used to winning ... ... and you' re not really a leader until you' ve lost .
$20 billion has been spent developing this system ...
oh , come on , guys , the chefs at nasa ...
i want wine !
i need wine !
it' s about nutrition .
ln five days , i think ...
whoa !
that' s high level static discharge .
i think we should check this out .
this doesn' t look so good .
it' s a lightning superstorm .
popping up all over the world .
got ' em .
tracking .
uh oh .
rome does not look good .
this planet is decaying faster than we thought .
it' s just the start .
soon they' il be em spikes and microwaves will break through the weak spots and ...
all right .
get this ship in the ground .
now .
ah !
summer in the pacific .
yeah , the world is inside out .
i was saving this for later , but ... this is the time for ...
josh , do you mind ?
no , not at all .
yeah .
we should have a name for this baby .
oh , she' s called virgil , actually .
virgil the poet that led our man into the depths of hell ?
that' s it .
that' s appropriate , i guess .
well , here' s to virgil .
to the planet .
to virgil .
to virgil .
no flashbulbs , no press , nobody cheering .
it' s .... weird .
let' s go .
cabin pressure , tsl , 3 . 5 .
check .
ecs cabin repress open .
and repress vlv closed .
check .
fluid dump valve .
we are about to begin our journey into the heart of the cosmos , into the very core of our own planet .
close .
where we find therein ...
check . the secrets of the universe ... ... 3 . 5 psl . ... the mysteries of time ...
lm circuit lockup .
check . ... hope for the future .
and signal .
deep earth control , this is virgil .
signal check .
this is deep earth control .
i have thumbs up across the board .
you are clear to initiate power up .
reactor power confirmed .
at 1 , 000 rpm , we will countdown to launch .
on your mark .
pad leader , stand by for launch .
all right , virgil .
mark .
gantry count .
ten , nine , eight , seven , six , five , four , three , two , one ...
launch .
500 feet .
leveling out .
okay , guys , let' s swing forward .
800 feet .
light ' em up , beck .
gyro leveling operational .
hull integrity holding .
i' m going to keep her nose down about 15 degrees and ...
oh , my goodness .
they' re singing to us .
virgil' s resonance tubes are powered up , so they' re vibrating sub sonically .
actually , we' re singing to them .
what' s our depth ?
1 , 600 feet , plenty of room on both sides .
hull integrity is good .
you sure ?
let' s increase impeller speed .
i think we' il be needing additional control .
stick , i' m getting a seismic reading .
what' s happening ?
t phase .
underwater earthquake .
still think the water launch was a good idea ?
yes , yes , i chose this location because the crust is thin here .
the downside is ... there' s lots of seismic activity .
4, 000 feet .
you see that rock ?
that is not good .
we' re losing steering here .
there' s some kind of crosscurrent .
1 4, 000 feet .
okay , guys , fasten your seat belts .
we' re turning into the skid .
18, 000 .
18, 500 .
they' re going way too fast .
21 , 000 feet .
we hit the wall , we' re rabbits on the highway .
pressure , pressure , pressure , pressure .
what do you mean , pressure ?
i thought you said this thing was indestructible !
i said the pressure makes us stronger .
we just don' t have enough of it yet .
we' re at 25, 000 feet .
pull out , sir .
can' t .
what ?
we' re locked in .
go to full throttle .
standby to engage front and lateral lasers , please .
but what if we hit bottom in ten seconds here ?
just give it a couple more seconds .
the lasers will fire .
no , there' s not enough time for power up .
27, 000 feet .
the lasers will deploy .
29, 000 feet .
do it !
and ...
do it !
now .
and we' ve got a signal .
all right .
yeah !
all right .
switching on electron spin burst transmitters .
plotting through lowest density material , reconfiguring every five minutes .
hull integrity 100 % .
reactor power 100 % .
all green on the bomb compartment .
speed is 60 knots .
hot damn .
all right , we' il be through the crust in 15 minutes and into the mantle .
24 hours to the core , and then assuming we survive ...
assuming ?
yes , assuming .
another 15 hours to the inner core outer core border .
they' re doing well .
the crust is just rock .
now it gets interesting .
virgil , can we get a status check ?
we' re about to make the transition into the mantle .
come on , come on .
well , exterior pressure is 800, 000 pounds per square inch .
and hull integrity is 100 % .
it is as if we we' re diving through the memories of the planet .
but we are about to pass from memory into madness .
are you going to be doing that carl sagan narration all the way to the core ?
i beg your pardon ?
i said ...
l i have an obligation to my students , to my readers ...
an obligation to make a book deal perhaps ?
two book deals , if you' d like to know the truth .
i read that last book .
it wasn' t very good .
oh , really ?
really ?
when did you learn how to read ?
people .
drs. zimsky and keyes ?
you guys are our resident geophysicists .
what do you make of this ?
the mantle is a chemical hodgepodge of ... a variety of elements ...
i don' t know .
well , commander , wise men say , " when in doubt , you should go around .
no .
it' s too big .
we turn too slow .
anything that we can' t go through displays as black .
so what' s ... what' s static ?
it' s nothing .
what do you mean ?
it' s nothing .
it' s empty space .
i ...
i never taught the computer how to read empty space .
and i never taught virgil how to fly .
oh , god !
oh , no , man !
oh , dear god .
serge , you all right ?
yeah .
anybody hurt ?
no .
you okay ?
yeah .
what' s that ?
what is that ?
from the cooling system .
shut that down .
shut it down .
i told you to go around her .
nobody listens to me .
where in god' s name are we ?
whatever has us jammed up is inside our lasers .
shut ' em down .
we' re not going anywhere .
powering down .
josh , is there any other image you can pull up ?
nope .
whatever it is , it' s also inside our mrl cameras .
we have to go outside .
what ?
believe me , i hate to admit it , but i think he' s right .
i' m coming .
i want to collect samples .
wait , hang on , hang on .
wait , wait , the first problem is , the only way out of the ship ... is the way we came in , which is through the impeller outlet ...
which is still at 5, 000 degrees .
exactly , i mean ...
i' il just flush it with liquid nitrogen from the cooling system .
wait .
the cooling system that' s keeping us from roasting to death in this ship ?
well , just a small part of it .
alternatives ?
anybody .
whoa , whoa , that' s it .
it' s like a giant ... giant crystal .
where the hell are we ?
well , the good news is , it looks like the suits can take the pressure .
it' s completely jammed the laser assembly .
we just ... we got to hope , if we can cut it loose ,
they' re still functional .
careful !
okay .
got it .
beck , try the lights , will you ?
lighting up .
oh , it' s magnificent .
oh , my god .
aladdin' s cave .
it' s like a crystal grand canyon .
i think it' s a geode .
but i don' t understand how it could have survived down here .
cobalt shell , maybe ?
no . l i mean , in a magma environment of 5, 000 degrees .
something would have to protect it .
unbelievable .
zimsky .
yeah ?
we' re inside a giant gem bubble , wrapped in a cobalt cocoon 700 miles below the surface of the earth .
hell of a day .
yes , it is .
i' il start cutting .
okay , braz .
i' m going to check the hull .
call me if you need me .
okay .
oh , no .
zimsky !
yeah ?
zimsky , look !
it' s an amethyst .
oh , god , we' ve breached the shell .
guys , you don' t have to be here !
i want you back inside !
well , i think that means me .
orders are orders .
wait , josh .
the problem is i' m losing oxygen .
braz , what can i do ?
check the feeds for me .
check the feeds for me , josh .
quick !
i' m coming .
i' m coming as fast as i can .
hey , guys , at this rate we have three minutes before the lava gets to us .
come on , guys .
come on .
it' s not going to work without oxygen !
we' re losing oxygen !
i fixed it .
now cut !
that' s good .
it' s working now .
it' s working well now !
that' s good , josh !
