once upon a time there was a lovely princess .
but she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort , which could only be broken by love' s first kiss .
she was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible fire breathing dragon .
many brave knights had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison , but none prevailed .
she waited in the dragon' s keep in the highest room of the tallest tower for her true love and true love' s first kiss .
like that' s ever going to happen .
what a loony .

if for any reason the winner is unsuccessful , the first runner up will take his place .
and so on , and so forth .
some of you may die , but it' s a sacrifice i' m willing to make .
applause .
let the tournament begin .
what is that ?
ugh , it' s hideous .
oh , that' s not very nice .
it' s just a donkey .
indeed .
knights !

how about him .
oh , hey .

you' ve won the honor of embarking on a great and noble quest .
quest ?
i' m already on a quest .
a quest to get my swamp back !
your swamp ?
yeah , my swamp !
where you dumped those fairytale creatures .
indeed .
all right ogre , i' il make you a deal .
go on this quest for me and i' il give you your swamp back .
exactly the way it was ?
down to the last slime covered toast tool .
and the squatters ?
as good as gone .
what kind of quest ?
ok , let me get this straight !
we gonna go find the dragon and rescue a princess just so farquaad will give you back the swamp , which you only don' t have , ' cause he filled it with full of freaks on the first place .
is that about right ?
you know what ?
maybe there is a good reason , donkeys shouldn' t talk .
i don' t get it shrek .
why didn' t you just pull some old ogre stuff on them ?
you know , ??? .
grab his bones to make you brave .
you know the whole ogre trick .
oh , you know what .
maybe i could have decapitated entire village and put their heads on plate .
got a knife , cut open their spleens and drink their fluids .
does that sound good to you ?
a , no , not really , no .
for your information , there is a lot more to ogres than people think .
example .
example ?
ok , a a m , ogres are like onions .
they stink ?
yes , no .
o , they make you cry .
no .
oh , you leave them out on the sun and they get all brown and start ??? little wild hairs ?
no !
layers !
onions have layers .
ogres have layers .
onions have layers .
you get it ?
we both have layers .
o , you both have layers .
you know not everybody likes onions .
cake !
everybody loves cakes .
cakes have layers .
i don' t care what everyone likes .
ogres are not like cakes .
you know what else everyone likes ?
paffe .
hey , let' s get some paffe " and they say i don' t like paffe .
paffe is delicious .
no !
you tensed , irritating , miniature peace of barden .
ogres are like onions .
end of story .
bye , bye .
see you lather .
paffe is maybe the most delicious thing on the whole damn planet .
you know i think i' ve preferred your humming .
do you have a tissue or something , ' cause i' m making a mess .
just the word paffe has made me start slimying
why , shrek , did you do that ?
man you got to warn somebody before you just crack one off .
my mouth was opened and everything .
believe me donkey , if it was me , you' d be dead .
it' s brimstone .
we must be getting close .
yeah , right , brimstone .
don' t be talking ??? brimstone .
i know what i smell and ??? no brimstone .
and they don' t come of stone neither .
sure it' s big enough , but look at the location .
oh , shrek , remember when you said that ogres have layers ?
oh , yeah .
well , i have a confession to make .
donkeys don' t have layers .
we wear ??? sleeves .
wait a second .
donkeys don' t have sleeves .
you know what i mean .
oh , you can' t tell me you' re afraid of highs .
no , i' m just a little uncomfortable of being on a rickety bridge over boiling lake of lava !
come on donkey , i' m right here beside you .
ok ?
for emotional support .
we' il just hackle this thing together one little baby step after time .
really ?
really really .
ok .
that makes me feel so much better .
just keep moving and don' t look down .
don' t look down , don' t look down .
shrek !
i' m looking down !
i can' t do this .
just let me off right now , please .
but you' re already half way .
yeah , but i know that half is safe .
ok , fine .
i don' t have time for this .
you go back .
shrek , no , wait .
don' t do that !
oh , i' m sorry .
do what ?
oh .
this ?
yes , that !
yes , yes .
do it .
ok .
no , shrek !
i' m doing it .
i' m gonna die .
i' m gonna die .
shrek , i' m gonna die .
that will do donkey , that will do .
cool .
so where is this fire breathing pain in the neck anyway ?
inside .
waiting for us to rescue her .
i was talking about the dragon shrek .
are you afraid ?
no , but shhhhh .
oh , good .
me neither .
because there' s nothing wrong with being afraid .
here' s a ... , something responsible of the situation .
not to mention dangerous situation .
and there' s dragon that breathes fire .
i' m sure he' s meaner than a cow or anything , but they' re scare .
you know what i mean .
i' m sure he' s heavier than a cow ...
donkey .
two things .
ok ?
shut , up .
now go over there and see if you can find any stairs .
stairs ?
i thought we were looking for the princess .
the princess will be up the stairs in the highest room in the tallest tower .
what makes you think she' il be there ?
i read it in a book once .
cool .
you handle the dragon , i' il handle the stairs .
oh , i' il find those stairs .
i' il ??? .
that' s right .
those stairs won' t know which way they go .
the drafting stairs , ???
don' t mess with me .
i' m the stair master .
i' m master of the stairs .
i wish i had a stair right here right here now , i' d step all over it .
well , at least we know where the princess is .
but where is the ...
dragon !
donkey , look out !
got you .
oh , what large teeth you have .
i mean , white sparkling teeth .
you probably hear this all the time from your food , but you must bleach yourself , because that is one dashing smile you got there .
and do i detect the hint of minty freshness ?
and you know what else ?
you' re a girl dragon .
oh , sure .
i mean ' course you' re a girl dragon , ' cause you' re just ricking the feminine beauty out .
what' s the matter with you ?
do you have something in your eye ?
man , i' d really love to stay , but you know i' m a asthmatic and
i don' t know if we would worked out .
you' d be blowing smoke and stuff .
shrek !
no , shrek !
shrek !
wake up !
what ?
are you princess fiona ?
i am .
awaiting a knight so bold as to rescue me .
oh , that' s nice .
now let' s go .
but wait , sir knight .
this be our first meeting .
should not be wonderful , romantic moment ?
yeah .
sorry lady there' s no time .
hey , what are you doing ?
you know , you should sweep me out of my feet .
out through the window and down the rope by to your valued steed .
you' ve had a lot of time to plan this , haven' t you ?
uh um .
but we have to sing through this moment .
you can residing of a poem to me .
a ballad , a sonnet , a libretti .
or something .
i don' t think so .
well , can i at least know a name of my champion ?
shrek .
so , shrek .
i pray that you take this favor as a token of my gratitude .
thanks .
you didn' t slay the dragon ?
it' s not my job to do this .
now , come on !
but this isn' t right . ???
that' s what all the other knights did .
yeah .
right before they burst in the flame .
that' s not the point .
wait .
where are you going ?
exit is over there .
well , i have to save my ass .
what kind of knight are you ?
one of a kind .
... rush into a physical relationship .
i' m not that emotionally ready for commitment of a this magnitude .
that was the word i was looking for .
magnitude .
hey , that is unwanted physical contact .
hey , what are you doing ?
ok , ok , let' s just back up a little and take this one step at the time .
i mean , we really should get to know each other first , you know what am i saying .
as friends , maybe even as ???
hey don' t do that .
that' s my tail .
that' s ma personal tail .
and you' re going to tear it off ....
oh , no .
no !
it talks ? !
yeah .
it' s getting to shut up , that' s a trick .
ok , you two .
head for the exit .
i' il take care of the dragon .
ruuuuun !
you did it .
you rescued me .
amizing , you' re wonderful .
you' re a ... ... a little unorthodox i admit , but by deed is great and by heart is pure .
i' m entirely in your debt .
and where would a brave knight be without his noble steed .
i hope you heard that .
she called me a noble steed .
she thinks i' m a steed .
the battle is won .
you may remove your helmet good sir knight .
aah , no .
why not ?
i have helmet hair .
please .
i wouldst look upon the face of my rescuer .
oh , no , you wouldn' t , dust .
but , how will you kiss me ?
what ?
that wasn' t in a job description .
maybe it' s a perk ?
no .
it' s destiny .
you must know how it goes .
a princess locked in a tower and besieged by a dragon is rescued by a brave knight .
and then they share true love' s first kiss .
with shrek ?
you think , wait ... ... you think shrek is your true love ?
well , yes .
you think that shrek is your true love .
what is so funny ?
let' s just say , i' m not your type , ok ?
of course you are .
you' re my rescuer .
now , now remove your helmet .
look .
i really don' t think this is a good idea .
just take off the helmet .
i' m not going to .
take it off !
no !
now !
ok , easy .
as you command your highness .
you' re an ogre .
oh , you were expecting prince charming .
well , yes , actually .
oh no .
this is all wrong .
you' re not supposed to be an ogre .
princess , i was sent to rescue you by lord farquaad , ok ?
he' s the one , who wants to marry you .
well , then why didn' t he come to rescue me ?
good question .
you should ask him that , when we get there .
but i have to be rescued by my true love .
not by some ogre and his pet .
well so much for noble steed .
look princess .
you' re not making my job any easier .
well i' m sorry , but your job is not my problem .
you can tell lord farquaad that if he wants to rescue me properly ,
i' il be waiting for him right here .
hey , i' m no ones messenger boy , all right ?
i' m a delivery boy .
you wouldn' t dare .
you coming donkey ?
put me down !
yeah , i' m right behind you .
put me down or you will suffer the consequences .
this is not dignified .
put me down .
ok , here' s another question .
let' s say that a woman ' digged ' you , but you don' t really like her , that way .
now , how you let her down real easy , so her feelings aren' t hurt ?
but you don' t get burned to a crisp neither .
how do you do this ?
just tell her , she' s not your true love .
everyone knows it what happens when you find ...
hey !
the sooner we get to duloc , the better .
oh , yeah .
you gonna love it there princess .
it' s beautiful .
and what of my groom to be , lord farquaad .
what' s he like ?
well , let me put it this way , princess .
men of farquaad' s stature are in short supply .
oh no , shrek .
there are those who think little of him .
stop it .
stop it , both of you .
you know , you' re just jealous that you can never measure up to a great ruler like lord farquaad .
yeah .
well maybe you' re right princess .
but i' d like you do that measuring when you see him tomorrow
tomorrow ?
it will take that long ?
shouldn' t we stop to make camp ?
no .
that would take longer .
we can keep going .
but there are robbers in the woods .
whoa , time out shrek .
camp is definitely something that sounds good .
hey .
come on .
i' m scarier than anything we' re gonna see in this forest .
i need to find somewhere to camp , now !
hey , over here .
shrek , we can do better than that .
now , i don' t think this is decent for princess .
no , no , it' s perfect .
it just needs a few homey touches .
homey touches ?
like what ?
a door .
well , gentleman i' il be d ... , good night .
do you want me to come in and read you a bedtime story , ' cause i will ...
i said good night !
shrek !
what are you doing ?
i just ... , you know ...
oh , come on , i was just kidding .
and that one , that' s throwback .
the only ogre to ever spit over three wheat fields .
right .
yeah .
hey , can you tell my future form these stars ?
well , the stars don' t tell the future , donkey .
they tell stories .
look .
there' s blodna , the " flatulent
you can guess what he is famous for .
all right .
now i know you' re making this up .
no .
look .
there he is and there' s the group of hunters running away from his stag .
man , there ain' t nothing , but a bunch of little dots .
you know donkey , sometimes things are more than they appear .
forget it .
hey shrek .
what are you gonna do when we get our swamp back , anyway ?
our swamp ?
you know .
when we' re through rescuing the princess and all that stuff .
we ?
donkey , there is no we .
there' s no our .
there' s just me and my swamp .
and the first thing i' m gonna do , is build a ten foot wall around my land .
you cut me deep shrek , you cut me real deep just now .
you know , what i think ?
i think this whole wall thing is just a way to keep somebody out .
no , do you think ?
are you hiding something ?
never mind donkey .
oh , this is another one of those onion things , isn' t it ?
no .
this is one of those drop it and leave it alone things .
why don' t you want to talk about it ?
why do you want to talk about it ?
oh , why you block ?
i' m not blocking .
oh yes you are .
donkey , i' m warning you .
who are you trying to keep out ?
just tell me that shrek .
who ?
everyone , ok ?
oh , now we' re getting somewhere .
oh , for ' the love of pit ' .
hey , what' s your problem shrek ?
what do you got against the whole world anyway ?
look .
i' m not the one with the problem , ok ?
it' s the world that seems to have a problem with me .
aaa ...
help !
run !
a big stupid ugly ogre .
they judge me , before they even know me .
that' s why i' m better off alone .
you know what ?
when we met , i didn' t think you' re just a big stupid , ugly ogre .
yeah , i know .
so , a ...
are there any donkeys up there ?
well , there' s a cabby .
the small and annoying .
ok , ok .
i see him , now .
big shining one , right there .
that one , over there ?
that' s the moon .

i can feel it .
oh , you' re crazy .
i' m just bringing her back to farquaad .
oh , come on , shrek .
wake up and smell the fairemones .
just go in there and tell her how you feel .
there' s nothing to tell .
besides , even if i did tell her that ... well you know .
i' m not saying that i do , ' cause i don' t .
she' s a princess and i' m ... ... an ogre .
yeah , an ogre .
hey , where are you going ?

was it something that you ate ?
' cause i told shrek those rats were a bad idea .
you are what you eat , i say .
no .
i' ve been this way as long as i can remember .
what do you mean ?
look , i' ve never seen you like this before .
it only happens when the sun goes down .
by night one way , by day another .
this shall be the norm until you find true love' s first kiss .
then , take love' s true form ...
oh , that' s beautiful .
i didn' t know you wrote poetry .
it' s the spell .
when i was a little girl , a witch cast a spell on me .
every night i become this .
this horrible ugly beast .
i was placed in a tower to await the day when my true love would rescue me .
that' s why i have to marry lord farquaad tomorrow , before the sun sets and he sees me , like this ?
all right , all right .
calm down .
look , it' s not that bad .
you' re not that ugly .
wait , wait , i' il not lie , you are ugly .
but you only look like this at night .
shrek' s ugly 24/ 7 .
but donkey , i' m a princess .
and this is not how a princess is meant to look .
princess .
how about if you don' t marry farquaad ?
i have to .
only my true love' s kiss can brake the spell .
but you know , you' re kind of an ogre .
and shrek ...
well you' ve got a lot in common .
shrek ?
princess , i ...
how is it going first of all ?
good ?
good for me to .
i' m ok .
i saw this flower and thought of you because it' s pretty .
and , well , i don' t really like it , but i thought you may like it , because you' re pretty .
but i like you anyway .
a ....
i' m in trouble .
ok , here we go .
who could ever love a piece so hideous and ugly ?
princess and ugly don' t go together .
that' s why i can' t stay here with shrek , but only chance to live happily ever after is to marry my true love .
don' t you see , donkey ?
that' s just how it has to be .
it' s the only way to break the spell .
well , at least you' ve got tell shrek the truth .
no , no .
you can' t breathe the word .
no one must ever know .
what' s the point of being unable to talk ?
you got to keep secrets .
promise you won' t tell .
promise !
all right , all right .
i won' t tell him .
but you should .
you know , before this is over , i' m going to need whole lot of serious therapies .
look at my eye twitching .
i tell him , i tell him not .
i tell him .
i tell him not .
i tell him !
shrek !
shrek !
