corto , what are you doing outside ?
it' s time for me to go .
venice is making me lazy .
that is what venice is for .
would you like a glass of rosolio ?
rosolio ?
i didn' t know that still existed .
but , gold lips , when did you come here ?
i came in 1300 with the cabalist
mancello giudeo .
we were friends of dante' s then , but you just have to open that door to travel through time ,
like in a fable .
i would like to live in a fable .
your life is one big fable yet you don' t realize it anymore .
an adult who enters the world of fables cannot leave it .
did you know that ?
perhaps we are late ...
today' s december 34th .
it still isn' t new year' s day .
ah , yes , yes ...
but christmas was the 27 th .
in venice , the years are always a little longer .
what are you making them ?
thieves , only to punish them .
i never could read that book .
forget it , corto .
you wouldn' t have time .
your horoscope says you' re going on a long adventure .
are you sleeping ?
hong kong , february 15th 1919
the 9 , by virtue of change , becomes an entirely moving line ...
a strong line may become a weak one , and it' s in this way that we obtain ...
i don' t remember ...
i' m getting old ...
ah yes , yes !
the sign of the marrying maiden .
undertakings bring misfortune " .
corto maltese , are you sleeping ?
no , i was thinking of venice and gold lips .
you said young girls don' t marry adventurers ?
well , too bad !
that means i' il never get married !
you always want to joke , corto .
i never joke .
these are hard times .
the russians are fighting in the north , the japanese in the east .
the religious sects are becoming political organizations , united against the foreigners .
the white lotus ...
and what are you doing , long life ?
red triangle will wait for word from black diamond to transmit it to pink square who will inform white rectangle ...
sounds like a geometry class .
corto ...
when will you ever be serious ?
i am , long life .
how do i look ?
splendid !
the young women of hong kong will be crazy about you .
brother of the night salutes you ...
the triad watches over you , corto maltese .
war in europe is over !
it continues in siberia , in mongolia , in manchuria ...
war in europe is over !
good evening , rasputin .
why are you in hong kong ?
hong kong isn' t reserved for you , as far as i know .
you' re quite elegant in that trench coat .
it' s a present .
you like her ?
who ?
that junk over there .
are you bored ?
i' m never bored , you know that .
come on , let' s try and find a drink .
you' il always live in a dream world .
maybe you' re right .
it' s the time to do business !
with these wars between bolsheviks ,
white russians , mongols , chinese , you can get rich !
that' s a job for vultures .
i could kill you !
you' il kill me some other time .
there' s blood at your feet .
where' s the man who was with you ?
is this a riddle ?
the situation isn' t simple .
in fact , it' s extremely muddled !
the city is full of russian refugees ... adventurers ... pirates ...
like this person who was with you ...
this " captain rasputin " ...
we' ve been looking for him for months .
he' s with you .
chance or coincidence ?
probably both , lieutenant barrow .
i know a lot about you , corto maltese .
you were already in china in 1905 and 1913 .
you indulged in piracy in the south seas .
you' re allied with a chinese secret society !
am i so popular in your police stations ?
a police officer must suspect everyone , commander .
may i go now ?
what are you making them ?
thieves , only to punish them .
i never could read that book .
you' re back at last .
that' s good .
i' m glad you' re here .
me too , hu .
did you receive everything ?
yes .
but money isn' t everything .
sometimes we need to meet .
a letter was brought for you this morning .
this letter is perfumed ...
do you recall a morning of butterflies , an afternoon of wildflowers ?
the red lanterns are looking for you .
what is it ?
another secret society ?
the red lanterns are very brave young women .
they oppose all the other secret societies .
if i were you , i' d listen to them .
rasputin !
lost your touch , ras ?
you used to be a great knife thrower .
i still am .
otherwise you wouldn' t be here you' d be dead .
but why did you disappear this afternoon ?
you were surprised ?
and the blood stains ?
i played a trick on you .
i cut myself while you were talking to make you think that something happened to me .
we haven' t had an adventure in years , like the one with the monk or the royal fortune ...
escondida island ...
santo ...
do you remember ?
ras , you' re crazy !
i could kill you !
aren' t you tired of repeating yourself ?
here , take your knife .
it' s not my knife !
isn' t this your friend' s knife ?
that' s my knife !
so ... someone wanted to kill you ? !
greetings from the red lanterns , corto maltese .
the red lanterns have a business proposition .
are you ready to listen to us ?
since you saved my life ...
heard of admiral koltchak' s train in siberia ?
it' s the gold train ...
tsar' s gold ...
last year , after the execution of nicolas il ,
koltchak stole the imperial treasure in the name of the counterrevolutionary government .
his armored train is carrying gold .
until now , no one has managed to intercept it .
it interests the warlords ,
manchuria' s bandits , the allies in siberia ,
and secret societies .
like yours ?
we will recruit the men and finance the enterprise .
but we need someone able to lead the expedition .
we thought of you , corto maltese .
you know she' s here in hong kong ?
she , who ?
you know who i mean .
she' s here , but we don' t know where .
if you wish , we can search .
those bloody lanterns !
we can use them to get the gold !
i accept you as my associate !
are you out of your mind ?
if we accept ... everyone east of moscow will be against us .
think you can find a junk ?
at last !
i knew it !
there' s the corto that i know ... the same ol ' corto !
give these instructions to the shanghai red lanterns .
they' il help you reach kharbine in manchuria .
here' s a thousand gold sterling for your first expenses .
i' il only take the instructions .
if we succeed , we share the expenses and the profits .
i' m your associate , not your employee .
is that clear ?
if you wish ...
but didn' t you say that two associates is one too many ?
i said i didn' t like an odd number of associates .
one is too little , and three is too much .
we must go .
we' il send someone for the corpse .
maybe she' s still here ...
maybe she' s waiting for you ...
that' s in the past .
it should no longer have any importance .
perhaps you didn' t know it , but i too was in love once .
a young girl from nikolaievsk who took care of me when i was a kid .
i never knew my mother .
she died the day i was born .
doubtless of fright when she saw you !
one more word , and i' il kill you .
calm down .
i have nothing against your mother ... except a certain responsibility ...
why , your boat is fantastic , captain rasputin !
you' re right , i was lucky .
i got this junk for next to nothing !
your friend was too lucky .
what do you mean ?
the men on this boat are paid by the red sunset society .
they are to eliminate you before we reach shanghai .
the red sunset ?
a secret society .
traditionally , they act at sunset .
the red is for blood .
a fine tradition !
they' ve set a machine gun in the stern .
now go away , we' re being watched .
you wanted adventure ?
what ?
the crew ...
deal with the captain .
ras , where are you ?
i' il take care of the machine gun !
hey , you !
were you on the junk ?
are you the only survivor ?
it looks like it ...
couldn' t you lower that gun ?
come to shanghai .
gen. chang will decide your fate !
come , sailor , gen. chang will speak with you .
what were you doing on that junk ?
looking for an exotic experience ?
usually , westerners scorn our junks .
couldn' t you afford a crossing on a better ship ?
did you know that we have a mutual friend here in shanghai ?
you surprise me , general .
mister song , the millionaire ...
mister song ...
or should i say his daughter ,
miss wee lee song ?
you' re often spoken of in the house of song , commander .
are you back in china for this person ?
no , rest assured ...
miss wee lee song has nothing to do with my presence .
if it' s not a woman who has earned us the " honor of your presence " in china , it' s perhaps ... a train .
a russian train , for example .
filled with gold ...
i don' t understand ...
isn' t it strange ...
these days , many people are dying without understanding why .
ah , tea !
one of life' s rare joys !
and one ear knows how to prepare it so well .
thank you , one ear .
one ear is a tibetan monk .
he heard something he shouldn' t have , and his ear was cut off .
but he makes a very good cup of tea .
i' m blind , deaf and dumb , general ...
like the three wise monkeys .
that was someone that didn' t know the story of the three wise monkeys .
you may go , commander maltese .
why did you let him go , general ?
because he' il lead me to the gold train .
ah , another victim of this craziness .
good !
you always enter a sauna with a pistol and cigar ?
yeah .
because i' m jack tippit of the american air force .
as for the cigar , it' s gone out .
that' s what always happens to a good connecticut cigar .
and the hat ?
actually , i don' t know ...
and you ?
me what ?
who are you ?
you' ve asked me too many questions .
are you an anarchist ?
bolshevik ?
or a romantic revolutionary ?
you ask too much , too !
i know you stick a knife in , from the bottom up .
easy ...
i' m not looking for a fight .
i' m tired .
very tired ...
well then , rest .
i can' t !
i keep thinking about that woman , her train full of cossacks and murderers .
if you knew the duchess ...
this war couldn' t be waged without the trains .
all we know is that , inside their wagons , some wish to escape the conflict , others wish to rule .
they even transport their homeland in their trains !
even the gold of holy russia ...
you still haven' t said why you' re in shanghai .
i' m just passing through on my way to kharbine in manchuria .
i' m going there too .
i have a spare seat in my plane .
have you never flown ?
no .
and i have no wish to try !
that helmet really suits you .
you look like my aunty !
i won' t say what you look like !
cheer up , sailor .
it' il take 2 days , excluding stops !
shut up !
hey , there' s a plane following us !
what makes you say that ?
i' m bored , spatzetov ...
i' m bored to death .
give me the newspapers .
unfortunately , they' re a week old .
impossible to find others ...
it' s major tippit .
tippit ?
be a dear , shoot him down !
stop it !
we got him !
you ok ?
corto , meet the world' s biggest son of a gun ,
major spatzetov of the ussurian cossacks .
i' m sorry , major .
we thought it was a bolshevik .
how can i make it up to you ?
i hope you' re not too angry .
they hate their planes being shot down .
these late afternoons in siberia are like nighttime .
how are you , duchess ?
i' m well , thank god .
i sometimes thought of you , tippit .
your friend' s hurt !
please leave me out of your affairs .
your friend has a bad temper .
he' s giving himself airs !
but he' s a brave lad .
what' s his name ?
corto maltese .
the duchess is expressing what a pleasure it is to meet you .
friendship with the allies !
if it isn' t profitable to them , they' il abandon us .
you' re right .
we should follow von ungern and organize with him and semenov the fight against the bolsheviks , even if von ungern' s crazy .
yes , perhaps ...
he thinks mongolia will produce a new horde of warrior aristocrats .
he dreams of founding an asian empire to conquer europe .
he' s convinced he' s the reincarnation of genghis khan !
all that is deliciously romantic ...
but it' s true , we' re not united enough .
spatzetov , which side are you on ?
yours , your excellency , the most surprising woman i' ve ever met !
have you known her for long ?
last summer in vladivostok ...
a welcome party for the us troops , the social niceties ... the usual foolishness ...
we squandered caviar , champagne ... and duchesses ...
i' d like to stop at the manchurian border .
manchuria is dangerous ...
i must go to kharbine .
i' il try to help you , cortouchka , but the siberian border is controlled by baron von ungern sternberg .
who ?
a direct descendant of the teutonic knights .
his family was eliminated by the revolution .
could you ? ...
my necklace ...
your necklace is warm ...
yes , i danced and drank with my men .
you have to have fun from time to time .
especially if afterwards , you can pray for forgiveness from our lord ...
here is semenov , chief of the baikal cossacks , general of the wildcat division .
mainly known for his reputation as an assassin !
my dear marina , did you have a nice trip ?
serghei semenov , my friend ,
i had a lovely voyage across all of manchuria .
the chinese and japanese adore you !
they don' t love me they' re using me .
but introduce your friends .
commander corto maltese and major tippit of the us air force .
ataman semenov ... who only believes in his armored trains .
you should believe as much as i do , marina .
oh , come see what the japanese gave me .
and you too , gentlemen .
i' m sure that it' il interest you !
i present to you my destroyer !
with that , i can keep the entire bolshevik army at bay .
my trains and my cannons are powerful .
they' re heavy and slow .
anyone ever tell you to keep your mouth shut ?
corto maltese ...
your name seems familiar ...
unless it' s your head ...
i must have seen it somewhere .
that' s impossible .
my head has never changed places .
it' s always been with me !
serghei , you know that i must continue my journey .
koltchak will not wait .
true .
and you' re the only one the admiral still trusts .
our future will soon be in your hands , marina .
tippit is continuing with me .
corto maltese must get to kharbine , in manchuria .
can you help him ?
i' il take care of it .
you' il take care of it how ?
don' t worry , marina .
nothing will happen to your sailor .
i hope i' il see you again ... some day .
me too .
beware of semenov .
goodbye , corto .
goodbye , jack .
gen. semenov ordered me to kill you once you crossed the border .
corto maltese , welcome to manchuria !
semenov doesn' t like you .
i don' t like you either .
welcome , corto maltese .
have we already met ?
i helped you ... on the junk .
i had a friend on that junk .
a friend ?
have you any news of him ?
perhaps .
now follow me .
you are expected .
the time has come , corto .
i didn' t expect to find red lanterns so far north .
the path of our interests has no end .
so i see ...
the wars in china and manchuria are ruining our people .
we have a lot to learn from the russians .
they electrified the country .
soon , they will eradicate illiteracy .
but you didn' t ask me to educate your people .
where is this famous gold train ?
have you been able to locate it ?
koltchak has taken refuge in irkoutsk , but wants to leave , and semenov is ready to attack him .
who' s singing ?
a russian officer .
his name is nino .
welcome , sailor !
do you want a drink ?
not yet .
why not ?
sooner or later , we' il drink together .
fate has it that we love the same woman .
an extremely choosy woman ...
she stole my soul .
that' s nonsense .
perhaps ... but this nonsense is all i' ve got left .
in this snow , even the russian and manchurian guards won' t go out !
what should i call you ?
call me shanghai li .
i' m ready .
why did you put on this full dress uniform ?
because i' m still part of this military insanity .
don' t you remember ?
she loved uniforms ...
who knows who she gave my soul to ?
don' t mention that to me again !
we must warn general chang !
you should disguise yourself .
semenov might recognize you .
semenov ...
i' d like a word or two with him .
semenov is the worst enemy and the worst friend one could have .
how did you meet him ?
the duchess marina seminova introduced us .
is the duchess pretty ?
yes ...
i' d say so .
what did you say ?
i said yes .
when you' re near her , it' s like being near something warm and soft .
merry christmas , corto !
corto , my friend ...
merry christmas !
but today' s not christmas !
so what ?
we celebrate christmas whenever we please !
i found you again , corto !
corto , corto , corto !
rasputin !
it' s really you ?
who else would it be ?
your aunty ?
i lost you in shanghai .
now i find you in siberia .
you always underestimate me .
that' s your mistake .
caviar and vodka , corto !
things from back home ...
like the gold that we' re going to steal !
to russian gold !
it won' t be easy .
there' s this semenov ...
i was with two friends .
where' d they go ?
that' s me .
got it ?
right , let' s deal with this semenov !
commander , the americans control the entrance to the railroad at tchita .
the americans ?
i thought it was the japanese ...
in any case , what counts is the junction at karymskoe .
that' s where we' il wait for koltchak' s train .
make sure the line' s open for our return .
yes , commander .
and don' t disturb me again !
why are you looking at me ?
you' re looking at me too !
hey , you two !
are you in the cast for the troupe' s theater ?
what cast ?
what theater are you talking about , imbecile ?
we' re officers in the venetian navy , sent as military advisers to the siberian and mongol cossacks .
why not marco polo and his uncle en route to cathay ?
show me your papers !
one moment , captain .
i' il answer for these two officers .
you may go .
yes , sir !
you were wrong to make fun of him .
do the cossacks lack a sense of humor ?
with semenov , even those who had one , lost it ...
what happened the other night ?
you disappeared in a snowstorm .
i always disappear in snowstorms .
i can' t help it .
is that the duchess ?
yes , i think so .
about time !
at last we can get out of here .
and go where ?
your excellency , the bolsheviks have taken irkoutsk .
we were decimated .
we retreated , but we can' t hold out much longer .
and the admiral ?
admiral koltchak was betrayed by the czechoslovakian legionnaires .
the bolsheviks threw his body into the angara river .
we must leave , your excellency .
we haven' t time to transfer the gold .
bring your men on our train .
the honor of taking the imperial gold goes to you .
it was his excellency the admiral' s wish .
serghei , what are the americans like ?
the americans ?
they' re yids ...
they' re all jews from wall street !
ungern was right when he said that the yids want to divide up the world .
but it' s not just the bankers who' re yids !
lenin and trotsky are also yids , subversive yids and bolsheviks ...
but my family' s jewish too , serghei .
i saved them from a pogrom !
have you forgotten ?
no !
no ...
i just thought ...
you' re starting to think , macha ? !
i said i wasn' t to be disturbed !
bring me another girl !
when an object wants to become a subject , it' s no longer useful !
do you want to follow her example ?
are you a freethinker , too ?
me ?
i' ve only just arrived with one of your officers .
captain laroslav .
nino !
that madman whose soul was stolen ...
sometimes , he disappears to go look for it , then ... he comes back without having found it .
one day , i' il sew one onto his skin .
come here .
kneel down .
you' re very far north for a shanghai girl .
what are you looking for ?
around here , you' il die before finding it .
i' m looking for a golden dragon .
a golden dragon ?
you must be crazy .
but who knows what your madness is hiding ?
massage my head ...
i want to sleep .
i am how i am .
i don' t care about politics , because i' ve chosen to live with tons of money , surrounded by beautiful women and beautiful objects .
to have them , i must steal .
in fact ... you' re a thief .
of course i' m a thief .
but what i steal , i spend .
i distribute the money .
lots of people live off what i spend after a robbery .
koltchak' s train !
the gold train' s coming .
the girl ...
shanghai li , where is she ?
she' s on this train , too ...
and ready for the big game , like all of us !
the general promised us our share .
we' il be rich .
hurry !
perhaps it' s better to die this way , killed by one of our own ...
that semenov is a great guy !
a butcher !
he did all the work !
send someone to unhitch the gold car !
and fast !
i' il go , commander !
traitor !
she was going to kill you !
let' s take care of the gold .
stop thinking about that woman !
after the revolution , we' il be rich !
the world will be full of russian duchesses in exile !
it' s you , nino ...
what' s going on ?
did you find your soul ?
no , semenov , i didn' t find my soul ... but i' m going to kill you .
it' s not for the gold .
simply because you' re a murderer , unworthy of belonging to the army .
watch out !
a black dragon on their palm !
it must be the triad .
no , it' s not the triad .
the black dragon' s a sect general chang belongs to .
which way did semenov go ?
to the locomotive .
i preferred the leopard outfit , my little shanghai li .
i no longer have the leopard skin , but i' ve kept the claws .
hurry up !
i don' t understand .
the . 45 she' s pointing at us is clear !
this gold will serve the cause of the asian revolution !
russia has exploited us for too long .
it' s time that the west paid .
if you want to stay alive , jump off the train !
young woman , russia has committed many errors , true , but i' m a russian officer and i must defend what belongs to russia .
as for myself , i think that i' d rather die .
young woman ...
well , i never heard such a ridiculous argument !
in blue summer ends of day ,
i will wander pathways , pricked by hay , splay the tender grass ...
dreaming ,
i' il feel its coolness play at my feet .
let the wind lash my bare brow .
no words , not a thought ...
but infinite love will surge in my soul .
and on i shall wander and on , vagabond .
in nature , as happy as in a woman' s company .
what are you thinking about , corto ?
arthur rimbaud , a french poet .
at such moments , i think of nothing else .
you' re prisoners of baron von ungern sternberg' s
asian cavalry !
your hands are beautiful , but small ...
as a child , they must have been chubby and very white .
never mind that .
what do you see ?
your life will be short , von ungern .
very short ...
two more years perhaps , no more ... and much blood ...
two years ...
that should be enough for what i have to do .
what else ?
i see nothing but blood ... blood ...
will i be victorious ?
all i see is , you will kill many ... and you will spill a lot of blood !
we found them in the mountains near three borders lake .
why were you between mongolia and manchuria ?
i' m trying to forget someone .
you look like a gypsy , or a sailor , yet you wear a russian officer' s cap .
the cap was a gift ...
well ?
well , what ?
i' m waiting !
waiting for what ?
we came to this fair land to steal koltchak' s gold ... which ataman semenov himself tried to steal .
and how does it all end ?
that , i don' t know .
all i can say is , semenov didn' t succeed !
fine ...
fine !
in that case , i won' t have you shot ... not for now anyway ...
as for this chinese girl , tomorrow she' il go to the military brothel .
she' il entertain my soldiers .
and you who look like that vile rasputin ...
what' s your name ?
rasputin , excellency !
you must all be crazy !
pardon me , excellency , but the only crazy one here is corto maltese !
you were lucky .
stay out of it , mongol !
ras , you really have an impossible temper .
come in .
at least you' il be warm here .
in xanadu did kubla khan a stately pleasure dome decree , where alph the sacred river ran through caverns measureless to man , down to a sunless sea .
so twice five miles of fertile ground with walls and towers were girdled round .
and there were gardens bright with sinuous rills where blossomed many an incense bearing tree .
and here were forests ancient as the hills , enfolding sunny spots of greenery .
you didn' t call me here to talk about coleridge .
why not ?
the pen and sword can sometimes go part of the way together .
the pen and giant cannons , perhaps less often !
please , sit down !
i have a proposition .
in 3 days , my division will march in conquest of urga .
from there , i' il go to fight choy balsan and sukay bator .
i don' t know either one .
they' re subversives .
i must create a new religious war ... a counter revolution more terrible than their own revolution !
it' s time to return to the old beliefs .
the ethics of war and shamanism will be our only religions .
from the sea of japan to the gulf of finland , we' il make the yellow sun rise against the red star !
come with me .
assuming that i need to believe in something , why should i choose mongolia rather than ... a secret court , called the " court of the arcane " in venice ?
because no one is in complete agreement with himself .
i' m offering you a new empire !
i' ve turned down so many things .
it' s the first time i' ve been offered an empire .
but i refuse .
i force no one to follow me , corto maltese .
no " is a very nice word , provided that you' re the first to say it , and you had that courage ...
let' s drink to our future !
excellency , here is the mopa .
praise buddha .
i will read the sacred word ...
he' s a tibetan diviner .
he' il tell us the secrets of life and death .
the " tree book of fates " has millions of leaves , and on each is written a human' s fate .
when someone dies , a leaf falls .
i have seen yours .
there' s a black dragon in your life !
a broken black dragon ...
but those like you who know how to live are comfortable even in hell .
and now ... farewell !
remember , corto .
a broken black dragon .
the black dragon ...
it' s a chinese military sect .
it is also the name of the amur river .
perhaps he was advising you to go there .
to the amur river ?
it' s too far .
now go ... with your friends .
farewell , corto maltese .
a beautiful adventure , don' t you think ?
no , i don' t think so !
i want my share of the gold !
all you have to do is dive into three borders lake !
stop this childishness !
i don' t find you funny .
i don' t see why the baron let us go free .
the shaman told him to .
he also told me to watch out for a broken black dragon !
since the train stopped , his men have been dying of cold and hunger .
and koltchak' s gold belongs to you , general .
it' s in three borders lake .
it' s not so simple .
the red lanterns now have a powerful ally .
the sailor , corto maltese ?
no , no ...
the red lanterns will get rid of him now that the gold is in three borders lake .
the region' s controlled by sukay bator .
he' s the red lanterns ' main ally .
but admiral von ungern is also
in the region to fight sukay bator .
perhaps .
but not for now ... and not for gold .
we will have to confront sukay bator .
sukay bator , my friend .
i' m shanghai li .
remember me ?
yes , i also remember you had another name .
you must' ve had good reason to change .
who' s this russian officer ?
he is neither .
he is corto maltese .
he' s your husband ?
no .
he' s a lone wolf .
general chang' s train !
pulling into the valley !
that warlord never came this far before .
we must stop him going any further .
we' il soon be in bolkang nor .
we' il stop to let the men amuse themselves before going on .
let them go see the women .
but watch out for deserters .
hey , you !
you in the right car ?
you talking to me ?
yes , you .
i' ve never seen you before .
me neither !
corto ...
yes ?
is there a reason why we' re doing this ?
is your conscience bothering you ?
i' m just asking .
can' t i ask you as a friend to help me continue our adventure ?
you wanted some adventure !
you can shoot when you want to !
what ?
what do you think about me ?
tell me honestly .
what' s that got to do with anything ?
i just want to know .
i' d love to have friends , but i' m unable to .
why on earth not ?
aren' t i like other folks ?
of course you are .
actually , no .
maybe not .
and stop asking questions !
there , you attack me when i tell you , all i want is friends !
general , a mutiny !
the gunners are shooting each other !
beautifully done , comrade shanghai li .
we' re proud of you !
i' m sorry .
we can' t go see if they' re among the survivors .
we must go back to the lake .
i know .
are you crying ?
me ?
crying ?
you' re mistaken .
besides , it' s my business !
you have a bad temper , comrade .
but that' s your business , too .
i really thought then , i' d never see him again .
i only learned later corto got out alive , that he was one of the rare survivors .
there must be a guardian angel for sailors !
he was transferred to kharbine military hospital with a friend of his , a guy named rasputin .
corto' s eyes had been injured .
shortly after , he was better .
i helped him leave for hong kong .
he insisted on going .
when speaking about the duchess ,
i felt he was hiding something from me .
corto maltese arrived during the month of march .
i was happy to see him again .
times were hard , but he seemed to be the only one not to notice .
he knew that ...
chang had survived and was hiding here , in hong kong .
the triad had decided to eliminate the warlord .
so ... we helped corto find him .
for him , it had become a personal matter .
but i' il try to be more precise ...
it was nighttime ...
i knew , through a triad friend , you were alive .
it was a beautiful adventure .
what was the girl' s name ?
shanghai li .
it sounds like an american operetta .
lieutenant , how may i help you ?
i arrest you in the name of the british crown .
and what am i accused of ?
pillage , armed mutiny , massacre , arms trafficking and treason .
one ear , bring the tea .
thanks , but we don' t have time .
major osborne and colonel rand are waiting .
you' re still in hong kong ?
i thought you' d left .
i left , and i came back .
there was poison in his tea .
the servant did it !
he carried out his master' s orders .
perhaps , but it' s still homicide .
one ear , you' il need a good lawyer .
i' il take care of it .
thank you .
i thought you were mute ?
that' s it .
that' s all i can tell you .
he went to the region of kiang si .
for what reason ...
i do not know .
who are those girls ?
apprentice red lanterns ?
yes , but for now , they' re students at the new school in kiang .
i' m their teacher .
you wonder where the gold is ?
we managed to fish it out of three borders lake .
it will be used to build a big hydroelectric plant .
asia and the weak red lanterns thank you .
the weak red lanterns " ?
how' s your friend rasputin ?
he stayed for a week in hong kong .
then he left , taking my gauguin with him .
he wrote me a letter !
meet ling , an agricultural engineer .
ling is my husband .
i was curious to meet you , mr corto maltese .
second beauty spoke about you a lot .
second beauty is my real name .
i know you met during a revolutionary action in manchuria .
she was wonderful !
but you were wonderful , too !
tonight , the students and farmers wish to organize a theatrical performance in your honor .
i' il leave you .
you must have a lot to talk about .
ling is a marvelous man .
i didn' t want ...
where will you go ?
i don' t know ...
farewell , shanghai li .
