it' s you .
go .
you said the wind could not stop .
a playful wind stops at will .
you shouldn' t have come back .
i came back , for you .
nia !
mei , you' re back .
who will believe the madam of peony pavilion is the leader of the flying daggers !
i behaved badly that day .
please forgive me .
did i look like a real madam ?
very much so .
what do you think of mei ?
what do you mean ?
i mean her personality , of course .
she' s passionate .
go on .
she may be blind , but she' s very bright .
hardly anyone can match her .
not even i.
do you care for her ?
you are asking ... ?
a man and a girl traveling all alone , what else could i be talking about ?
mei is a rare beauty .
i care for her a lot .
then , i shall act as the matchmaker for you two to marry .
marriage is a big deal .
this is too sudden .
she' s not a good match for you ?
on the contrary .
mei is from a respectable family .
i' m just a humble swordsman .
our old leader loved his daughter dearly .
now i' ve become the new leader , it' s my duty to find her a good husband .
i haven' t been able to find anyone within the ' flying daggers ' who would be a better choice than you .
what do you say ?
i accept your offer .
our house is much obliged to you .
you' ve done us a great favour .
please accept my gratitude .
with much pleasure .
what is going on ?
where are our soldiers ?
they were ambushed .
you were both plotting to catch me by following mei .
you' re not blind ?
are you the old leader' s daughter ?
he has a blind daughter .
she doesn' t know martial arts , so i pretended to be her .
if you had known the truth , would you have followed her here ?
it' s all been an act .
who are you , really ?
my name is mei .
i' m just one of many girls in the house of flying daggers .
that' s enough .
take him out .
you wait here .
i want to finish him off myself .
move .
stop .
do you have anything to say ?
you' re not nia , the new leader .
you' re right .
of course i' m not nia .
nia wouldn' t show herself so easily .
who are you then ?
that is not important .
nia sent me to finish this matter .
you' ve done a good job , leo .
we' ve never met before , but i know you by reputation .
three years ago , we planted you as a mole in the government .
you' ve accomplished much in that role .
i failed to protect our old leader from being assassinated .
nia knew that you were away on duty .
there was nothing you could do .
i' m grateful for her understanding .
we need to win this battle against the government troops .
you and mei have successfully set up a trap for the general .
well done .
i' il report to nia and have you rewarded .
it' s my duty .
please tell nia the general has led all his best soldiers towards us .
be careful .
don' t worry .
nia has a good plan .
there is one thing i don' t understand .
what' s that ?
who sent mei on this mission ?
nia did .
has nia ever considered my feelings ?
what do you mean ?
i haven' t seen mei for three years .
now i have to watch her flirt with another man .
it' s not the first time
mei' s used her beauty to aid our cause .
i' ve heard about your feelings for her .
do you still love her ?
we' re facing a battle that will decide the fate of the ' flying daggers ' .
the troops are closing in .
this is not the time for love .
all right .
i will let you see mei .
you haven' t changed .
i' m still mei .
it' s been three years .
finally , we' re alone together .
i know .
you saved me during the battle with the soldiers .
thank you .
you don' t need to thank me .
i would do anything for you .
i know .
you' ve risked everything going undercover to win honour and to impress me .
you' re the only one who understands me .
i was all alone for three years .
you were in my mind every single moment .
my love for you was all i had to keep me going .
do you love him ?
you knew the plan .
it was only an act between you and him .
there is no future for you two .
do you understand ?
nia !
you can' t force a woman against her will .
do not pull this dagger out .
i' m sending you back to keep spying for us .
you will be more convincing with a dagger in your back .
you must leave immediately .
yes , ma' am .
i have sacrificed three years for you .
how could you love jin after just three days ?
mei , i also have a task for you .
jin is of no use to us anymore .
take him out and kill him .
leo plays a crucial role for us .
we can' t let jin ruin our plan .
you must kill him to prevent any future trouble .
you know our rules .
yes , ma' am .
i left you in order to save your life , but you still followed me .
please don' t blame me .
if your plan succeeded many in the ' flying daggers ' would die .
you wouldn' t let me go either .
it would be me on my knees , waiting to die .
you' re right .
if i won ,
i wouldn' t let you go .
go .
how will you explain this to nia ?
that' s my business .
why don' t you come with me ?
deep in your heart , you have a secret .
i guess there is a man you find hard to leave behind .
yes , a man who' s saved my life many times .
was it he who helped us in the last battle ?
yes .
then he has saved my life too .
do you still love him ?
when can we see each other again ?
we cannot .
we belong to two opposing sides .
if we meet again , one of us will have to die .
a decisive battle is imminent .
you and i are just pawns on a chessboard .
nobody cares if we live or die .
let' s go away together and roam the world , as free as the wind .
we' il wander around alone .
come and go without a trace ,
like a playful wind .
no , a carefree wind .
just you and me .
come with me , please .
are you going with him ?
why ?
you' re the love of my life .
you don' t have to love me , but you can never go with him .
otherwise you' il die .
mei ,
you' ve forced me to kill you .
i knew you would do this .
you knew and you went anyway .
why ?
why did you go ?
why did you go ?
why ?
to be free ... like the wind .
mei .
mei !
mei .
turn ...
what ?
turn ...
turn around ?
look behind you .
you' re a member of the ' flying daggers ' .
you' re right .
you' re the one who loves mei ?
yes , i love her truly , while you are only playing a game .
if you love her , why kill her ?
it' s all your fault .
my fault ?
i warned you but you wouldn' t listen .
if i can' t have her , no one will .
she has betrayed me because of you .
you must die !
fine .
you kill mei , you must die too !
mei .
let him go .
if you kill him ,
i' il kill you with this dagger .
mei !
don' t pull the dagger out !
if you do your blood will drain and you will die .
you must not do it !
mei ,
i' m closer to him .
he will hit me first .
you cannot save me with your dagger .
mei !
mei !
you shouldn' t have come back ...
i came back for you , my love ...
a rare beauty in the north .
she' s the finest lady on earth .
a glance from her , the whole city goes down .
a second glance leaves the nation in ruins .
there exists no city or nation that has been more cherished than a beauty like this .
