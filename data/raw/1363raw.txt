hey !
over here !
hey !
hey !
oh , no !
hey !
are you okay ? !
what is it ?
look !
it' s . . .
what the ...
there is a single plate here .
its message is a warning to us who live today from an unknown civilization built long ago that vanished into the distant reaches of eternity .
it says , " we return our arts to the dark from which they were created .
thus , they cannot be summoned a second time .
in accordance with this message , an organization called arcam was formed to seal away knowledge of this ancient civilization .
we know arcam' s special operatives as . . .
the spriggan .
this is elf .
come in , red company .
i repeat , come in !
no good ?
so , it' s just me again .
that' s all for today .
ominae !
first you miss weeks of school , and now you fall asleep .
you' il get left behind .
yeah !
what' s with that guy ?
who ?
tanaka ?
he disappeared , and his parents called the police .
then yesterday , he just showed up .
he looks really worn out though .
what do you want , tanaka ?
you don' t look too good .
ominae . . .
don' t be stupid !
what are you doing ? !
help me !
no !
yu !
are you all right ?
mr. yamamoto , what is this noah about ? !
and what the hell is this ? !
you know that six months ago , an arcam investigation unit was wiped out on mt .
ararat in turkey ?
yeah , i' ve heard the rumors .
after that , they found noah' s ark there .
noah' s ark ?
that' s right .
it' s just as it says in the legend of the flood in the old testament ,
genesis , chapters six through nine .
as time passed , evil came to thrive on the earth that god had created .
and the lord repented , resolving to destroy mankind .
but he had noah , a righteous man , build an ark , placing his family and two of every sort of creature upon it .
what' s that got to do with this ?
just hear me out .
three weeks ago , in a place separate from the ark , another of our investigative units was attacked .
this picture was taken afterwards .
three weeks ago ?
why wasn' t i told ? !
it' s obvious that it' s you they' re after .
it' s too risky !
mr. yamamoto , they turned my friend into a walking bomb !
and you want me to just stand by and do nothing ? !
the noah ruins are very dangerous for arcam .
i can' t send you to a place like that in your current condition .
this job is out of the question while you' re still hurt .
take this time now to have yourself properly treated . . .
you must be joking !
that was a direct challenge !
i' il settle this myself !
yu !
here you go .
here you go .
thanks .
dr. miesel is currently onsite , examining noah' s ark .
dr. miesel is currently onsite , examining noah' s ark .
old man miesel ?
we are about to enter turkish airspace .
fighter of unknown nationality has ordered a change of heading .
permission to land at diyarbakir has been withdrawn .
changing course for istanbul .
we will contact arcam' s turkish office to have someone at istanbul airport ready with further arrangements .
my , my , such hospitality !
you here to start a war ?
confiscated !
i' m sorry .
they were supposed to have been told .
well , let' s take our time .
by the way , were the guys behind us told too ?
oh , of course .
they' re friends of mine .
your friends , though , are in concrete at the bottom of the bosporus strait .
i don' t know who sent you , but you' re not ready to take me on yet .
this is the spriggan , yu ominae , a member of the special operatives unit of arcam , which seeks to seal off dangerous ruins of ancient civilizations .
he has rare athletic ability and reflexes .
he' s only seventeen , but he' s their number one operative .
his real abilities are nothing compared to this .
your petty tricks won' t work against him .
come to think of it ,
i' ve heard that he once betrayed your unit .
where is he now ?
i' m afraid we' ve lost track of him .
don' t worry .
he' s bound to show up here sooner or later .
arcam' s just a private army .
we' il bury him under that mountain .
won' t we , colonel mac dougall ?
so , that' s the mountain ...
that' s got to be one of arcam' s .
hey !
damn !
who the hell just opens fire ? !
how far are we going anyway ?
says the inept spy .
just keep your mouth shut .
look , i already told you . . .
arcam people don' t dress like that .
it wasn' t my choice !
gramps !
old man miesel !
margaret , you' re here too .
hey , you settle down !
what are you doing ? !
get your hands off me !
what are you doing ? !
get your hands off me !
what are you doing ? !
get your hands off me !
what' s all this ruckus about ?
gramps , it' s me !
it' s me !
yu , what are you doing here ?
glad i found you !
doctor , you know him ?
he' s ominae yu , our number one spriggan .
no way !
this kid ?
give me a break .
yu , i hear they' re trying to kill you .
chief yamamoto in tokyo was very worried .
so , you snuck out of the hospital and commandeered one of our planes .
you are so reckless .
here .
the latest armored muscle suit .
it uses a metal called orihalcon that reacts with the nerves .
it' s a battle suit of orihalcon fibers and artificial muscle .
it' s heat and pressure resistant .
it increases your strength about thirty times .
how long has it been since we had some time off ?
about two years , maybe ?
this is an orihalcon fighting knife .
with a knuckle guard !
what' s this ?
an armguard with approximately fifty meters of climbing wire .
an armguard with approximately fifty meters of climbing wire .
there' s a powerful climbing claw at the end of it .
it' s got a high capacity motor that can lift two or three people .
to think you' d need to arm yourself with that thing .
emergency !
unidentified intruders at site 2 !
all guard units and medics report at once !
here they come !
let' s see how this stuff works .
what' s happening ?
you damn freak !
get out !
pull back !
son of a bitch !
man , are you guys stupid .
that' s not very nice !
the spriggan !
yu ominae !
bastard , you' re not getting away !
fat man , he' s all yours !
hold it !
where do you think you' re going , traitor ?
what ? !
major fat man , you' re alive ? !
that was pitiful !
has joining arcam slowed you down ? !
hey , kid , what' s the matter ?
show us what you can really do , the way we taught you !
you bastard !
who are you ?
i' m jean .
a spriggan , jean jacques mondo .
where' s miesel ?
pick on someone your own age .
over here .
gotcha !
i guess i have you to thank for this body of mine .
ominae !
ominae !
is that you , jean ?
freeze !
we went to so much trouble to brainwash that kid , and this is the best you can do ?
now i' m going to wring your neck ...
ominae ! ... with this machine i call a body ! ... with this machine i call a body !
now you start to fight !
that' s enough !
he' s dead .
little boy and fat man have failed to recapture miesel .
nothing but big talk ...
we knew this would happen .
it' s about what we expected .
but colonel , what if arcam gets into the ark ?
not to worry .
we analyzed the magnetic field it destroyed our satellite with and the results have been quite useful .
the plate and stone tablet found at each of the ruins verifies this .
we have the key to noah .
you' re very confident .
i' il kill anyone who interferes .
all you need do is shut up and follow my orders .
you look very tired .
who was he ?
my old commander .
ominae , what did you come here for ?
revenge ?
you think it' s their fault that you' re like this now or something .
you' re too soft !
don' t get so hung up on the past you forget your job now .
when you act like that , you endanger everyone who' s entrusted you with their lives .
according to the information from our probe satellite , the magnetic fields are focusing .
dr. miesel' s investigation is proceeding .
he seems to be getting close to the truth .
there' s no more time .
the situation is serious .
i suggest we act .
we don' t have to .
mac dougall will handle it .
but general !
i' m being kept fully informed .
don' t worry .
he' s been indoctrinated with the objectives of the united states .
so , this is noah' s ark ?
it' s bigger than i thought .
the old testament has it three hundred cubits long and fifty wide , but this is at least four times that size .
the material it' s made of isn' t mere wood either .
our current technology can' t even scratch it , much less break it .
this is the entrance .
can' t you open it ?
it' s made of some kind of time stop material .
what ? !
time doesn' t flow , so you can never break it .
this might not have been made by human hands .
thanks for making the rounds .
you' re u. s. machine corps , aren' t you ?
u. s. machine corps ?
cyborgs attached to the pentagon .
what' s so funny ?
he' il be here soon .
the man with the power of the devil !
we are in control here .
lay down your weapons and do as i say , please .
who are you ?
damn !
what the hell did you do ? !
yu !
yu !
you little brat !
you' d better not .
though , if you insist on ending up the same as him , that' s up to you .
damn you !
i' m not dead yet .
you must be tough as a cockroach to survive my attack wave .
it takes more than that to kill me !
a cockroach is much better off on the floor !
shut the hell up !
shut the hell up !
protect yu !
stop , you fools !
there is no point in continuing this futile fight !
dr. miesel and miss margaret , we meet at last .
i am lord of the sky .
awaken me , and have dominion over what enfolds the earth .
when evil runs rampant on the earth ,
change the blessings of heaven to those of hell
and create humanity anew .
that was the message left on the stone tablet that we have .
putting that together with your data , the " blessings of heaven " are the sun' s ultra violet rays .
by adjusting the ozone layer and carbon dioxide that enfold earth , you control ultra violet radiation .
in other words , noah is an atmospheric control system !
what do you plan to do with noah ?
what ? !
what are you doing ? !
that data is government property !
you will enter noah' s ark with me .
you won' t refuse if you care about these people' s lives .
wait !
you are disobeying orders !
move .
well , doctor ?
so , you' re mac dougall ?
you have a magnetic amplifier implanted in your brain .
you must know that one mistake , and it' s brain death for you .
at best , you' il live about five more years .
i see why the pentagon is so anxious to secure you .
how many crimes have they justified in the name of the states !
they conducted countless human experiments to create you .
you are the product of a government' s monstrous ego .
old fashioned sentimentality .
besides , i was not chosen by the government .
it was god that chose me .
what ? !
look at you now , spriggan .
where' s that kid ?
shoot him ! kill him !
stop right there !
smart boy !
don' t you care about what happens to your friend ? !
try me and see !
it' s resonating !
so , you had the other one .
dr. miesel , the rest is up to you .
lower the walls !
seal off this block !
you bastard !
there must be some meaning behind the location of the ark .
why would it be here at the top of a mountain that stands alone ?
what if the ark itself is what caused the flood ?
perhaps mt .
ararat exerts a strong magnetic field that suppresses it ?
that' s it .
from here on , we' re in uncharted territory .
who knows what might happen ?
no problem .
well , let' s go .
go to hell !
damn !
jean !
jean , are you okay ?
ominae , where' s that kid ?
they were headed towards the ark .
he' s got old man miesel and his assistant as hostages .
idiot , get them first !
jean !
jean !
get going !
ominae !
make sure you get them out .
take care of him !
well ?
i see ...
hey !
the door' s open .
where' s the old man ?
inside , i guess .
why didn' t you follow them ?
but ...
see for yourself .
light doesn' t go in there .
i' ve never seen anything like it .
so , this is noah' s heart ?
and this is noah' s control panel !
let' s get started , doctor .
you okay ?
take care .
doctor ...
now the seal is broken .
doctor !
this is ...
wonderful !
now that arms reduction is well underway , the environment is considered to be the biggest problem .
acid rain , ozone depletion , global warming . . .
with noah we can solve all these problems .
mac dougall , where are you ? !
if the atomic bomb is the symbol of power , then noah will surely become the symbol of peace .
my country must be the world' s leader at all times , you see .
and to do that , we absolutely had to get our hands on this .
why does the pentagon want it ?
using it would be like signing your own country' s death warrant .
what is it that you want ?
it' s dead ?
what is this ?
noah probably caused the ice age that destroyed the dinosaurs , but it has other functions besides changing the atmosphere .
it' s such a crazy theory that no one would believe it .
but seeing those dinosaurs convinced me .
the dinosaurs and all those other strange creatures must be there for experiments to create the next generation of new animals .
what are these things ?
in other words , noah is also a machine for the generation of life .
well , doctor ?
isn' t it splendid ? !
human history started right here in noah' s ark !
come , let us create a whole new world with our very hands !
ridiculous !
so , that' s what you wanted to do .
mankind took the wrong path down history .
mankind is god' s one and only creative failure !
so you intend to take god' s place and pass judgment on mankind ? !
now is our only chance .
i want you to use noah to create the next generation of life forms .
that' s why i brought you here .
come , work with me .
no !
damn !
where the hell are they ?
what did you just say ?
i said , no !
you' re crazy .
i see .
then i have no choice .
what are you going to do ?
bring a fire extinguisher !
bring a fire extinguisher !
what the ...
earthquake !
no !
look !
the ark' s moving !
what' s this shaking ?
that damn kid' s moving the ark !
i' ve started the warming mode .
the polar ice caps will melt and the warmer water will cause abnormalities in the weather .
the majority of the land will be flooded .
well , what will you do , doctor ?
there' s no going back .
it' s the start of the second flood legend !
that cockroach !
so he' s still alive !
if it can' t be broken from outside , i' il do it from within !
i' il shoot down this ship along with that brat !
gramps !
there !
why you !
that' s enough !
shut up !
doctor !
so , here you are .
i' il take the doc , thanks .
yu !
we have to seal noah off !
hurry !
get him out !
the plate . . .
the plate . . .
you won' t get away !
and here i gave him the chance to work with god .
i' m your man now !
i' il take you with me down to the bottom of hell !
what kind of fool enters a holy place with his boots on ?
quit playing with fire like a kid already !
you seem to want to take me to the grave with you , but you' il have to go to hell by yourself .
very funny .
and a kid like you is going to send me there ?
don' t you get it yet ?
your orihalcon suit that you' re so proud of is like a toy to me .
will you stop defiling the house of god with your blood ?
house of god ?
what god is there here ?
god is noah and the one who uses it !
how can you call this mass murdering device a god ? !
just as it has been in ancient times past , the power of noah is given only to those who are chosen .
scum like you have no right to be here .
you' re just being used !
don' t you understand that for them you' re just an expendable item ?
neither the pentagon nor the machine corps concern me now .
with these hands , i will judge their rotten hearts .
get serious !
begone !
i won' t let you ...
dead , finally .
project cosmos . . .
pentagon' s special experimental unit that raised children to become elite killers .
so , that' s where you come from , number 43 .
i am not a number .
i am yu ominae .
i know the story .
you wiped out the entire unit all by yourself .
stop , number 43 !
drop your gun .
that' s right .
good .
what' s wrong with you , 43 ? !
i am ...
yu ominae !
you' re just a killing machine too .
i am ...
you saw your parents ' death in the people you killed ?
is that all it took to drive you mad ?
we are not machines .
i am human .
i' il die before i become
an instrument for killing again !
human , you say ?
you think a mere human can strike me down ? !
i am god !
don' t make me laugh !
what kind of a god is man made ?
noah is starting to go out of control in response to your powers !
what the hell do you think you can do with that body made of junk ? !
i am god !
i will destroy the human race !
but first . . .
you die !
you damn fool .
damn !
just when the nightmare was about to wash away .
your wild fantasy is over , kid .
what are you doing ?
i said i' m not an instrument for killing .
noah is now in destruct mode .
what ? !
the inside of the ark was an alternate dimensional space , but now , it' il be swallowed up by our third dimension !
damn you !
we' ve found many other magnetic fields like noah' s .
it means there are lots of other ruins with powers like this all over the world , just waiting to be found !
the real fight has only just begun , spriggan !
what the hell ?
look !
the ark !
damn it , i' m not gonna make it . . .
wake up !
ominae !
idiot , this is no place to sleep !
jean ...
jean ...
what ?
you' re right .
i am too soft .
you' re right .
i am too soft .
i can still see that kid' s face in my mind .
yeah , that' s soft , but that' s what i like about you .
what did you say ?
shut up and let me carry you .
what' s that ?
so , that' s what the ark really looks like .
it' s crumbling !
impossible !
we couldn' t even scratch it !
4, 000 years have suddenly returned !
the ark is destroyed .
all has returned to nothingness .
what about yu and jean ?
hey !
look !
yu !
you' re both alive !
yu !
