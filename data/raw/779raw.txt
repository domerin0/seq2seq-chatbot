my quiver .
listen to me .
i just wanted what you wanted .
a little taste of the good life .
a little taste of honey .
ls that so bad ? ls it ?
but you win .
man , i fold .
greed has hardened your heart .
and money' s poisoned your soul .
l' m out of here .
there' s nothing as dangerous as large quantities of money .
that' s why i' ve always remained an independent contractor , an odd job man .
l want no part of this .
take the arrow out of my back .
you will never see me again .
help me , god !
come on .
honey ...
take the arrow out of his back .
thank you .
thank you .
souvenir .
hey !
hey .
l couldn' t sleep .
i got to talk to you .
yeah , i got to talk to you too .
you know , this big rally tomorrow , i' m a wreck about it .
l got to give a big speech .
i' m not a speech guy .
are you kidding ?
come on , those infomercials you did .
you' re great in front of people .
really ?
you thought i was good ?
you never said a word about it .
because it was just another thing of yours that made me miserable .
what ?
this is what i have to talk to you about .
sit down .
l killed corky .
you ...
when ?
now , please , just don' t say anything till i' m done , all right ?
the day that you gave me the wine , remember ?
l got drunk on the wine .
l actually was drunk from before .
i went into your yard and ...
so that' s it .
there you have it .
well , you know , it sounds like it was an accident .
why didn' t you tell me ?
i should' ve told you .
that' s the thing .
but i don' t know what happened .
l felt guilty or something .
and i was just so wrapped up in the envy that i felt for everything you had .
lt' s true what they say .
lt' s like a little green monster that comes out and it just poisoned my head .
and , by the way , you did nothing wrong .
you followed your dream .
you did what you wanted to do .
l was always saying , " don' t do it .
you did it and it worked .
look , you built a house , right ?
that' s all you did .
you built a house .
l mean , it' s a big house .
i mean , it' s a really big house .
lt' s a large house .
it' s a ...
i mean , it' s ...
lt' s gigantic , nick .
it' s the white house .
you built the white house here , and we' re in the shadow of it .
literally , every day at 4 : 00 , we' re in its shadow .
that' s not your fault .
you wanted to be friends still ,
you didn' t want to move and i love that .
lt was coming from such a good place , but it was ...
lt really got to me because every day i' d have to look at you ,
and see you with all of this stuff .
you know , buy the yellow lamborghini that goes 500 miles an hour .
have a bowling alley next to your room .
lf i could do it , i would .
everybody should have a merry go round .
of course you should .
jealousy , every day .
and it was just chewing me up .
your kid' s playing the concert piano , my kid' s banging trash cans .
and that has nothing to do with money .
that' s just his musical ability .
that' s a whole other thing .
you just gave to us .
you gave and you gave and you' re so generous .
and what am i going to give you ?
l gave you tube socks for christmas last year .
that' s not going to work .
i like the socks .
you gave us so much .
the coffee machine .
it' s a beautiful , giant rocketship sized coffee machine .
debbie loved the coffee .
i' il tell you something , i never tasted it .
l wanted to tell you that .
l can' t even tell you i haven' t tried the coffee .
like i' il feel better if i don' t drink your coffee .
and you gave our kids flan .
all of a sudden my son' s going ,
daddy , where' s the flan ?
lt felt like a dagger in my heart every time he' d request flan .
lt made me feel little .
l felt like a little man who didn' t like flan .
the horse was great , nick .
of course you should have a horse .
does it have to be a white horse that you come galloping up on ,
and it neighs and makes the whole thing ?
of course .
make it a beautiful horse that i think , honestly , didn' t like me .
lt had nothing to do with anything , i never clicked with it .
l think the horse sensed something .
i think " horse sense " is a real thing .
because the horse had a feeling .
he came over and sensed the envy i felt .
he' d come over and eat the apples .
he' d see me and give me a weird look .
l' m telling you .
you know how sometimes the side of a face and you get one eye ?
he would keep the eye on me and i knew he was thinking something .
that' s unrelated to what happened with the arrow .
that was an accident .
l swear to god .
i swear to god .
i couldn' t do it if i tried .
l' m sorry about this .
i feel horrible .
i feel bad .
l feel like i have this fountain in my yard that i don' t deserve .
l don' t deserve to be your partner .
l don' t deserve to be your friend .
i just ...
well , you know what , tim ?
you made a mistake .
you' re human .
everyone makes mistakes .
so what , man ?
you' re still my best friend .
really ?
of course .
of course .
come on , man .
lt was a big mistake .
lt was a big mistake .
it was a doozy .
corky .
i' m sorry , nick .
no , no .
it' s okay .
l know how much you loved him and i ...
l did love corky .
l never liked corky .
l mean , he' s beautiful on the outside .
it' s just something wasn' t ...
we' re still partners .
there is no way you are getting out of this partnership .
okay .
okay ?
and i will see you tomorrow at the big rally .
yeah .
good .
big day .
big day .
poor corky .
one little target arrow .
you wouldn' t think that could kill a great big horse .
that' s exactly what i thought .
lt' s one little arrow and when i shot the bum ...
he hardly seemed to notice .
you know , that fountain looked a lot better in rome .
yeah .
well ...
c' est la vie , as the romans say .
on this beautiful , clear day ,
l think it is appropriate that we clear the air
of the toxic distortions that my husband and , by association , myself ,
are somehow poisoning our environment in our efforts to purify it .
lt' s not true .
no es verdad .
ladies and gentlemen ...
please help me welcome nick vanderpark and tim dingman .
thank you .
ladies and gentlemen , young people .
l stand here with my partner , tim dingman ...
that' s right .
... grateful for this opportunity to address the central question
posed in so many colorful and eloquent variations .
where is the shit ? !
my god .
nick .
nick !
corky ?
mr. and mrs. vanderpark , sorry we had to perform an autopsy ,
but when any large dead animal comes in proximity with the public
it must be examined immediately for health reasons .
l' m a little curious .
did you feed your horse a lot of apples ?
our neighbors have an apple tree .
corky loved their apples .
did he ever defecate in their yard ?
i imagine .
can you tell me what you did when the horse defecated in your yard ?
we used vapoorize because nick invented it .
we get crates of it for free .
well ...
lt' s all making sense .
the horse was poisoned .
we did find a broken shaft of a small target arrow in the sternum ,
but that played no part in the horse' s death .
the horse died from the prolonged ingesting of a certain chemical ,
which by itself is harmless , but when combined with certain fecal bacteria
becomes a lethal poison .
a little person ?
lethal poison .
that chemical is the ingredient in every can of your so called miracle invention .
he had enough of it literally to kill a horse .
l am obligated , of course , to report this to the epa .
epa ?
mmm hmm .
environmental protection agency ?
do you have to do that ?
right .
you have to .
it' s all right .
every time without exception ?
the next item , an extra large bed that sleeps nine comfortably ,
for , let' s say , $1 00 .
xl bed , sleeping nine .
got to love it for $1 00 . $ 72 for this white statue of a man on a horse with a spray can . $ 72 , anyone ?
no ?
anybody need a portable phone ?
everyone needs one .
you want one in your kitchen , in your extra bedroom .
you got a portable phone right there .
it' s going to go for $5 .
the next thing is item 31 .
l like this bug net .
why don' t we find out the estimated cost ?
oh , we' ve got two cases of a semi gourmet flan .
l believe that' s some sort of custard dish or something .
the semi gourmet flan is going to start the bidding at $4 .
nick ?
yeah .
l think i have an idea .
yeah ?
yeah .
like a really big idea .
really ?
when you got your idea , did you feel it immediately ?
oh , yeah .
right away .
you got one of those ?
like one of my ideas ?
i think so .
what is it ?
yes !
hey .
hey !
stop the auction !
you just cannot eat flan and drive at the same time .
look , i' ve got flan all over me .
can' t somebody come up with a better idea ? !
we have .
that' s right !
be one of the millions enjoying the taste sensation sweeping the nation .
nick' s talking about pocket flan !
pocket flan !
no spoon , no mess !
that' s right .
three simple steps , folks .
just flip it !
flip it !
squeeze it !
squeeze it !
mmm .
and enjoy .
enjoy !
wait a second , tim .
what was that name again ?
pocket flan !
lsn' t that just fantastic ?
no , nick , it' s not fantastic .
it' s flan tastic .
yeah , but , tim , nick , i have a question .
how about us who are lactose intolerant ?
we' ve got a new soy based pocket flan .
lt' s flan in a tube .
lt' s a little bit of happiness in a tube .
let' s say i' m jogging .
l' m getting tired , i need a pick me up .
what am i going to do , get a candy bar ?
lmagine if you' re jogging with some of this stuff .
what' s going on ?
it' s not going to work .
here' s the other thing .
that' s good .
i want to get down there where it' s brown and super sugary .
where do you ... ?
i can' t ...
ln here we' ve mixed it up .
you' ve got all that .
it' s pre mixed .
the brown is always part of it .
even if you don' t see it .
ln the tour de france , they' re going 20 miles a day , going up mountains .
what do you think they pull out of their spandex bikini bottom
to squeeze into their mouth when they want to eat ?
pocket flan !
and here' s another question .
i got to get some ...
i' m going to get some cornflakes .
i don' t have time for cornflakes .
i do have time for flan .
that' s right .
i' d love to see this ...
this has been vacuum tested
to a depth of 200 feet if you' re scuba diving .
just the other day i see this kid walking down the street .
he has the pocket flan .
right ?
right .
he squeezes it ... he' s on a skateboard .
he squeezes it ...
lt arcs up .
he goes like ... and ...
that' s like a new skateboard trick .
who here likes to drive ?
you guys like to drive ?
yeah .
who here likes to drive race cars ?
anybody ?
all right .
l' m captain speedway ,
and nothing tastes better at 200 miles per hour than pocket flan .
firemen .
i got to go save someone .
maybe i need a little extra something .
where am i gonna put my hose ?
i can' t hold the hose and this thing .
" where' s the hose go ?
i put a hose under my arm and then i fight the fire .
this is on a serious note .
recently we received a letter from a woman , gladys , who ...
well , pocket flan saved her life .
all right .
she was a backpacker .
she was stuck out in the woods ...
and , by god , pocket flan ...
l can' t think of it .
l wanted to say some tearful thing , but i couldn' t think of a thing .
