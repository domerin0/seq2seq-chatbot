shh shh shh .
this is a story from long ago ... when the great mammoths still roamed our lands .
it' s the story of my two brothers and me .
when the three of us were young ... we were taught that the world is full of magic .
the source of this magic ... is the everchanging lights that dance across the sky .
the shaman woman of our village told us ... that these lights are the spirits of our ancestors ... and that they have the power to make changes in our world .
small things become big .
winter turns to spring .
one thing always changes into another .
but the greatest change i ever saw ... was that of my brother ... a boy who desperately wanted to be ... a man .
get down !
what ?
get down get down !
kenai !

hey , will you two knock it off ?
that' s all right , sitka .

oh , right the big manhood ceremony .
it doesn' t matter what the spirits say .
you' il always be our baby brother .
oh , yeah ?
well , wait until i get my totem .
baby brother .
aah !
hey , i said knock it off .

ha ha ha !
ooh !

kenai' s back !
kenai !
kenai , are you excited about getting your spirit rock today ?
it' s not a rock .
it' il be my totem .
ooh .
yeah , i' il probably get , like , a sabertooth tiger ... for bravery or strength or greatness .
you know , something that fits me .
how about a mammoth for your fat head ?
just make sure you get that basket tied up .
don' t worry .
no stupid bear is going to get anywhere near this fish .
just tie it up .

she' s back !

tanana' s got your rock !
come on !
tanana .

tanana .
what ?
tanana .
ha ha ha !
well , hello there , sweetheart .
what a big girl .
when each of us comes of age ... the great spirits reveal to us ... a totem that helps guide us through our lives .
some of us use courage to guide us .
ha ha .
others , patience .
and some of us , beauty .
kenai ... you nervous ?
whew .
excited .
ooh , you should be .
it' s a good one .
kenai , i have been to the mountain ... where the lights touch the earth ... and the great spirits have revealed to me your totem .
to become a man , your actions must be guided by one thing .
your totem is ...
love .
what ?
yes , love .
the bear of love ?
a love that connects and unites all living things .
who wants to trade ?
there is no trading !
uh , kenai ...
love is the most precious of totems .
it reveals itself in unexpected ways .
let love guide your actions .
then one day , you' il be a man ... and will place your mark next to those of our ancestors . and will place your mark next to those of our ancestors .
yeah !
oh ...
there he is .
ohh .
ha ha !
come here , loverboy .
uhh .
leave me alone .
aw , kenai , wait .
uhh .
i' m sorry .
what ?
your totem i think it' s really great .
you do ?
yeah .
and i made you something .
really ?
now when you skip around loving everybody ... you' il smell so sweet .
ugh .
uhh !
well , isn' t this nice ?
instead of fighting , you' re giving each other flowers .
yeah , isn' t it lovely ?
he' s so in touch with his totem already .
uhh !
hey , dog breath , go take care of the fish .
sure .
kenai loves me , he loves me not .
kenai loves me , he loves me not .
kenai loves me , he loves me not .
kenai .
someday , i' m going to just ...
he' s just such a
hey , bonehead , just because his totem is wisdom ... doesn' t mean he' s wise .
i mean , look at him .
kenai loves me , he loves me not .
hey !
whoa !
hi , denahi .
oh , hi .
ha ha .
aah !
ooh .
let go !
yeah ...
i guess the spirits messed up on both of our totems .
you know , i felt the same way when tanana gave me mine .
get out of here .
no , really .
i said , " the eagle of guidance ?
what does that mean ?
ha ha .
but now that i' m older ...
i know it' s about being a leader ... and keeping an eye on you two .
i just want to get my handprint on that wall .
just be patient , kenai .
when you live by your totem , you will .
really ?
guarantee it .
really ?
guarantee it .
but , come on .
the bear of love ?
i mean , a bear doesn' t love anyone .
they don' t think .
they don' t feel .
i mean , they' re
they' re thieves .
you didn' t tie it off , did you ?
uh ...
you should' ve got the totem of pinheads .
knock it off .
we' il just make another basket .
we ?
oh , no .
no .
it took me two weeks to make that basket .
you get loverboy to do it .
he' s the one that' s messing things up all the time .
typical kenai .
all right .
i' il go get your basket .
kenai , wait .
kenai !
what ?
uhh .
unh !
unh !
unh !
kenai !
kenai !
where' d he go ?
lf we' re lucky , far away .
huh .
aah !
uhh !
kenai !
kenai !
sitka , no !
you got to get out of here !
what ?
the bear !
look behind you !
aah !
hey , bear , come on !
over here !
come on , bear !
come this way !
uhh .
aah !
denahi !
uhh !

sitka .
sitka !
sitka ?

sitka !
sitka !
sitka .
sitka !
sitka !
sitka , where are you ?
kenai !
no .
sitka !
sitka !
help us find you !
sitka !
sitka , where are you ?
sitka !
you ready ?
for what ?
we' re going after the bear .
i know what you' re feeling , but killing that bear is wrong .
wrong ?
our brother is dead , and it' s because of that monster .
i don' t blame the bear , kenai .
i see .
killing that bear won' t make you a man .
oh , now you' re trying to be wise .
i' m trying to follow my totem .
why can' t you do the same ?
you really think love has anything to do with being a man ?
a man wouldn' t just sit here and do nothing .
kenai .
don' t upset the spirits .
spirits .
thanks for your wisdom .
i' ve got to stop him .
you left too soon , sitka .
your brothers need your guidance .
ha .
aah !
aah !
aah !
aah !
kenai .
uhh .
aah !
what ?
sitka ?
unh !
ooh !
uhh !
oh !
uhh !
unh !
unh !
no .
i don' t blame the bear , kenai .
a man wouldn' t just sit here and do nothing .
uhh .
so , kenai , you' ve decided to join the living .
whoo , that' s quite a bump you' ve got there .
that must' ve been one heck of a ride down those rapids , huh ?
tanana ?
uhh .
ohh .
ooh .
nana , you won' t believe this .
i was at the top of this huge rock ... and all of the sudden , this
kenai , honey , shh , shh , shh , shh , shh .

huh ?
no .
no , no !
no !
aah !
all right , all right .
aah !
will you settle down ?
kenai !
oof !
kenai .
kenai , kenai .
this isn' t going to work .
kenai , listen to me .
sitka did this .
hmm .
strange .
spirits don' t usually make these kind of changes .
oh .
oh , my , my , my .
sitka must have something really big planned for you .
yep , yep , yep .
you' re going to get a whole new perspective on things .
oh .
do you see in black and white or color ?
hey , listen to me .
you got yourself into this mess .
if you want to change , take it up with your brother' s spirit .
you' il find him on the mountain ... where the lights touch the earth .
he' il help you make up for what you' ve done wrong .
but i didn' t do anything wrong .
tanana ?

last year at the salmon run ... my friend bucky totally dared me ... but i' d heard about this other cub ... who stuck his tongue to an iceberg ... and then he started to float away .

ok , who' s next ?
what ?
wait , wait , wait a minute .
i think we all want to hear the rest of that one , koda .
i thought you might say that .
hmm , let' s see .
it was probably the fifth or sixth most coldest day ... in my entire life .
me and mom were eating fish , having a great time ... when all of a sudden , she pushes me into the bushes ... and tells me to be real quiet .
she says , " i smell something , " so i started sniffing .
there was something in the woods ... running right towards us , getting closer and closer .
ooh !
ahh !
hmm .
and then , out of the trees , jumps the hunter !
ahh !
and now there' s nowhere for mama to go .
the monster has her backed up against this giant glacier !
ahh !
the monster attacks pop !
but mom' s too quick for him .
and before he can do it again , she stands up real big ... and yells , " go away !
aah !
aah !
then mom smells more of ' em .
there' s a whole pack comin ' right at us !
sitka , no !
the bear !
she runs out to stop them ... before they can get to me .
and all around they' re poking her with sticks .
the whole thing broke , and they fell into the water .
there was ice everywhere !
she couldn' t hold her breath any longer before pow !
she burst out of the water .
i' ve never been so scared in my life .
i' m going after the bear .
koda ?
aah !
whoa !
fell off a glacier ?
i' ve never seen anything like that .
can you imagine ?
kenai .
what' s the matter , kenai ?
koda , so what happened next ?
was she ok ?
unh !
hey , kenai , what' s wrong ?

she got out of the water ok , but that' s how we got separated .
right after that , i met kenai .
kenai ?
rargh !
