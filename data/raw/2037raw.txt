sebastian ...
let' s try and focus .
what can i say ?
i' m a fool .
you' re not a fool .
i am .
a poor little rich boy .
it' s not your fault .
adolescence is a difficult time .
without great parenting , things can go awry .
but you have to rise above their mistakes .
here .
an autographed copy .
for me ?
it' s yours .
stop being so hard on yourself .
what' s in the past is over .
you' re right .
it' s hard to believe there was a time when i only thought about sex .
it' s no way to go through life .
take yourself , for example .
you' re a very attractive woman .
you have killer legs .
i' d love to photograph them ...
that was the old me .
i' m cured now .
same time next week ?
i' m going on my book tour .
i' il be back in a month .
why ?
other people need my help , too .
you' il do just fine .
i hope so .
if you need anything , just call .
i could use a hug .
all right ...
there you go .
your daughter on 1 .
tell her to hold .
is this her ?
she seems nice .
she' s great .
straight a student .
she' s attending princeton this fall .
she' s the type of girl i should be with .
she' s a little out of your league .
take care of yourself , sebastian .
thank you ... for everything .
shmuck .
yes ?
your daughter' s still holding .
hi , honey .
you kept me on hold .
he told me he loved me , and i believed him .
i' m so stupid .
it' s all right .
take a deep breath , step out of the circle .
cut the psycho babble bullshit , mom !
there' s pictures of me on the lnternet .
what kind of pictures ?
nudie pictures !
what do you think ?
how could you be so stupid ?
he was just so charming .
he said i had killer legs ,
and he wanted to photograph them .
things just got completely out of hand .
mom ...
are you there ?
mom ?
mother !
sebastian !
you' re going to pay for this , you little shit !
you sicko !
pervert !
what' s her problem ?
someone' s in need of therapy .
you won' t get away with this .
get away !
what' s your name ?
clorissa .
clorissa ?
god , you' re beautiful .
thank you .
i' m going to take you to lunch .
okay .
there' s no parking here , sir .
we' re so happy that cecile will be attending manchester with you .
you' ve been an inspiration to us .
we hope she can rise to the high standards you' ve set for her .
i' il do my best .
what was that ?
" thanks . " isn' t vietnamese lovely ?
kathryn is very popular at school .
listen to her and you' il go far .
where do you get your strength ?
it sounds corny , but ...
when i' m tempted by peer pressure , i turn to god .
he helps me .
that' s beautiful .
what are the boys like ?
cecile ...
is that all you can think of ?
forgive her .
she' s never been in a co educational atmosphere before .
it' s understandable .
most boys at manchester are very upstanding .
but there are a few bad apples .
like your stepbrother sebastian .
what he did to the school nurse ...
i hear she' s recovering quite well .
nice to see you again , mrs caldwell .
you remember my daughter cecile ?
my , what an adorable shirt .
my father took me to australia .
how are things down under ?
blossoming , i hope .
what ?
i' m so sorry ...
well , thank you for your help .
i' il call about your curriculum .
okay , thanks .
it was nice meeting you .
let' s go .
keep your legs together .
this isn' t jamaica .
i didn' t know it was asshole day .
i' m just taking the poor girl under my wing .
the parental units called .
how' s your whore of a mother enjoying bali ?
she suspects that your impotent , alcoholic dad is diddling the maid .
therapy not going well ?
it was fine .
clorissa .
call me .
i' m sick of sleeping with these insipid manhattan debutantes .
nothing shocks them anymore .
relax .
i have a mission for you .
remember court reynolds ?
the nazi who dumped you july 4th ?
i went to great lengths to please court .
i made huge sacrifices .
my feelings were hurt when i learned court had fallen for someone else .
you don' t mean .. ?
none other than cecile caldwell .
so that' s what this is all about .
keep your enemies close .
when i' m done with cecile , she' il be the premier tramp of new york .
court' s princess will be damaged goods .
why not just attack court ?
that could be traced back to me .
that won' t do .
everyone loves me , and i intend to keep it that way .
i see your point .
why should i care ?
you have to seduce young cecile .
she' s quite cute , you know .
young , supple breasts .
a tight , firm ass .
uncharted booty .
be her captain picard , valmont .
boldly go ... ... where no man has gone before .
i can' t .
why not ?
come on , kathryn .
it' s too easy .
get one of your moron friends to do it .
i' ve a reputation to uphold .
diddling the therapist' s daughter ?
she was overcharging .
this is a challenge .
i know all about menstrual cramps .
shut up and turn to page 64 .
why i plan to wait " , by annette hargrove , kansas city .
jesus christ , is she for real ?
she' s daddy' s little angel .
a paradigm of chastity .
let' s see .
boring , boring , boring ...
i love my parents .
making a mature decision ...
here !
she has a boyfriend named trevor .
going out for a year .
trevor understands .
trevor' s a fag .
too bad she lives in kansas .
au contraire .
the virgin' s father is the new headmaster at our school .
she' s staying with my aunt while her parents sell the house .
can you imagine what this will do for my reputation ?
screwing the new headmaster' s daughter before school starts .
she' il be my greatest victory .
you don' t stand a chance .
care to make a wager ?
i' il think about it .
duty calls .
dr greenbaum and her daughter will be an exciting entry .
your journal ...
could you be more queer ?
could you be more desperate to read it ?
sebastian ...
could you come here for a second ?
about that little wager of yours ...
count me in .
what are the terms ?
if i win ...
your hot little car is mine .
and if i win ?
you' il get something you' ve wanted since our parents got married .
be more specific .
in english ...
i' il fuck your brains out .
what makes you think i' il go for it ?
that' s a 1 956 jaguar roadster .
because i' m the only person you can' t have , and it kills you .
no way .
you can put it anywhere .
you got yourself a bet , baby .
happy hunting , sebastian .
your home is beautiful , mrs rosemond .
it' s been in my family for over 1 00 years .
does your family ride much ?
my grandpa used to break horses .
what was that ?
sebastian must be home .
pull !
sebastian !
fuck me ...
aunt helen !
god , i' ve missed you !
i' ve been looking all over for you .
i want you to meet annette .
annette hargrove , this is sebastian .
she' il be staying for a few weeks .
i guess that makes two of us .
welcome .
thank you .
aunt helen , why don' t you whip up some of that ice tea of yours ?
don' t get into any trouble .
we won' t .
come on .
quickly , lots to see .
i read your manifesto .
i must say , i found it rather appalling .
most people praise me for it .
most people are sheep .
you criticise something you' ve never experienced .
i just believe people shouldn' t make love before they are in love .
people our age aren' t mature enough to know those emotions .
are you a lesbian ?
no .
i just picked up on a little of that lesbian vibe .
i wouldn' t expect you to understand my beliefs .
what' s that supposed to mean ?
i know of your reputation .
what have you heard ?
that you promise girls the world to get them in bed with you .
who told you this ?
a friend wrote me .
that' s a little tacky .
it' s the truth , isn' t it ?
if you say so .
that' s good .
let' s try the g major scale .
once again .
remember , the third note is sharp .
i suck !
relax .
take a deep breath .
you' re concentrating too much on your bowing .
let me help you .
close your eyes .
mai lee , be careful !
we' ve had this discussion .
i didn' t mean to interrupt .
your playing was beautiful .
this is ronald clifford .
he' il be teaching me this summer .
nice to meet you .
likewise , i' m sure .
ronald is attending pre juilliard .
he' s composing his first opera .
it' s based on martin luther king .
dr king is my favourite .
i guess our hour' s up .
same time tomorrow ?
bye .
unbelievable .
some fag , no offence ,
wrote a letter to this chick describing my tactics .
any idea who it could be ?
if i did , the person would suffer .
where is the little girl from ?
kansas .
who do i know in kansas ?
greg mcconnell .
the football stud ?
i wouldn' t be surprised if he was your rat .
he hates me .
i fingered his girlfriend at homecoming last year .
i don' t think that bothered him .
what do you mean ?
greg likes to tackle tight ends on and off the field .
you' re shitting me .
i shit you not .
he used to sneak into my dorm drunk .
what are you doing ?
i' m not a fag .
if you tell , i' il kick your ass !
i only put up with it because the man has a mouth like a hoover .
too bad he' s in kansas .
not anymore .
the football team started practice last week .
we' ve already had a session .
good for you .
could you arrange a get together with him tonight ?
spartacus " is on tv tonight .
outstanding .
but it' il cost you .
just make sure your front door is unlocked .
shall we say the stroke of midnight , no pun intended ?
the stroke of midnight it is .
i take out my dick and i shove it right in her face .
i' m like , " suck it , you dumb bitch .
the gregster .
yes , the gregster .
gregory ?
hi , blaine .
i hear you went on a date with court reynolds .
i hear he' s nice .
he kept talking about this bulimic headcase he dumped on july 4th .
bulimic headcase ?
what a loser she must be .
sorry .
court' s invited me to the hamptons for labour day weekend .
that' s great .
you think so ?
i guess i' m just scared .
of what ?
boys .
i' ve never even got to first base with a guy .
haven' t you practiced on a girlfriend ?
no , that' s gross .
how do you think girls learn ?
close your eyes and wet your lips .
are you for real ?
do you want to learn ?
i guess .
that wasn' t so scary .
it was nothing .
let' s try it again .
this time i' il stick my tongue in your mouth .
massage my tongue with yours .
that' s what first base is .
okay .
eyes closed .
not bad .
that was cool .
maybe you should try it on your friend ronald sometime .
what are you saying ?
it' s obvious he' s crazy about you .
he sends me love letters .
how romantic .
have you responded ?
no .
don' t you like him ?
i think about him all the time .
if my mom found out she' d kill me .
you did hide the letters , right ?
in an antique doll' s house .
bring me copies of the letters .
why ?
i' m great at love letters .
i' il have him eating out of the palm of your hand .
maybe you can meet at my house .
you' d do that for me ?
of course .
we' re friends , right ?
best friends .
do you want to have a sleepover ?
hello ?
excuse me ...
excuse me ...
what a pleasant surprise .
the music' s playing in every room .
it' s not , just yours .
i thought you' d be pleased .
what are you doing in your room ?
reading .
anything interesting ?
yes , it' s quite intriguing .
for you .
something to start the new school year with .
you didn' t have to do this .
you hate it .
you just didn' t have to do it .
can you join me for a swim ?
it is ten o' clock , but we are reasonably young .
your proposal' s only mildly insulting , so i' il consider it .
give me a minute .
fuck her yet ?
i' m working on it .
call me later .
sebastian ?
would you mind turning around so i can put on my bathing suit ?
this is so embarrassing ...
it amazes me someone as charming as you can be so manipulative .
you' re not going to start again ?
what was my favourite part .. ?
he has never uttered a single word without some dishonourable intent .
every woman he has pursued has regretted it .
stay away from him .
you could at least have the decency to tell me who' s bad mouthing me .
not a chance .
you' re right ... about what you said today .
i' ve done some things i' m not proud of .
i' m not giving you a hard time .
it' s okay .
look at you , with all your morals and values ...
you seem to be happy in your choices .
i envy you .
no bullshit .
seriously .
you' ve got everything going for you .
you' re smart , you' re beautiful , you' re determined .
you' re everything i want in a girlfriend .
you know i' m seeing someone ?
yes , the infamous trevor .
it' s funny how you haven' t mentioned him .
he' s backpacking through europe .
he' s great .
i really miss him .
i care .
i' m sorry , but you' re not my type .
honestly ?
you' re smart , you' re beautiful ... determined .
that won' t get you anywhere .
the best you can hope for is my friendship .
good night , sweet pea .
oh , baby ...
" baby " ?
right on time .
shit !
give me my underwear .
don' t get so huffy .
what do we have here ?
look , valmont , it' s the first time i' ve ever done anything like this .
i was just ...
really drunk and blah blah blah .
please don' t tell anyone .
this could ruin my whole career .
your career ?
greg , what about your family ?
wouldn' t your dad be humiliated to find out his son' s a fudge packer ?
i' il do anything .
let' s just forget about this whole thing , okay ?
no .
i can' t help you there .
you' re bad mouthing me to annette hargrove .
what are you talking about ?
you' re the only one who knows her .
i never said a word to her about you .
he' s probably telling you the truth .
the man can barely write out a grocery list , let alone a letter .
all right ...
i believe you .
your secret' s safe with me .
actually , there is something you can do for me .
what else do you know about him ?
well , he' s smart as hell .
he' s dedicated to achieving his goals .
he always gives 1 1 0 percent .
he' s always watched my back .
he' s got a bad rep , but it' s mostly bullshit .
i' ve heard awful things about him .
from who ?
i' m sworn to secrecy .
how long have we known each other ?
forever .
it' s my job to look out for you .
you' re like a sister to me .
do i look like a gossip queen ?
it' s me .
greg .
the gregster .
i' m serious .
you swear not to tell anybody ?
i swear on my momma' s life .
that nosy bitch .
are you sure ?
she said " mrs caldwell " .
they met at orientation .
did you do what i asked you to ?
yeah .
she bought it ?
i' m pretty sure .
pretty sure , or sure sure ?
she bought it .
she tried to outdo me ,
even though i told her that i could do this .
my best friends sue , kelly and frances knew i could do it .
you okay ?
yeah .
you would not believe ...
it' s my mom .
i should get going .
see you tomorrow ?
absolutely .
goodbye .
peace out .
peace out " ?
moron .
okay , what' s wrong with you ?
are you ready for this ?
i' ve discovered that mrs caldwell urged annette to stay away from me .
interesting .
yes , it is .
i now plan to devote all my energy to destroying the douchebag .
the plot thickens .
cecile has fallen for her music teacher .
mrs caldwell will love that .
but don juan moves with the speed of a special olympic hurdler .
what' s your plan of attack ?
i rat cecile out to mommy , who goes ballistic and ends the relationship .
but who will they turn to for help ?
cecile is going away with court next week .
i need you to speed up her sexual awakening .
i' m at your service .
thank you .
that feels good .
sis , you' re so tense .
i know ...
i hate it when things don' t go my way .
it makes me so horny .
i hate it , too .
it seems like things are looking up for you .
it appears so .
any luck with your girl ?
moving along quite well .
have you succeeded in your task ?
any day now .
well , let me know when you do .
until then ...
down , boy !
come on !
hi , it' s sebastian .
i didn' t wake you , did l ?
no , not at all .
did i leave my glasses there ?
no , i don' t think so .
all right .
i guess i' il see you around .
is that really why you called ?
no .
i miss talking to you .
a moment of honesty .
well , i' m not liking it too much .
what are you doing tomorrow ?
i' m going out with you .
i came as quick as i could .
what' s wrong ?
it' s cecile .
you promise not to say anything ?
yes .
it isn' t drugs , is it ?
it' s worse .
i think there' s something between cecile and her music teacher .
ronald ?
that' s crazy .
yes , she' s so young , he' s so ...
black !
brown sugar ... no sugar .
he' s sent her love letters , they' re under her doll' s house .
something like this could destroy her reputation at manchester .
i hope i was right to tell you .
i' d hate to see her ruin it with court .
i can' t thank you enough .
you will be discreet ?
absolutely .
who the hell do you think you are ?
excuse me ?
i' m not paying you to pervert my child .
i think you' re misunderstanding something .
care to explain this , then ?
where did you find those ?
margarita did , when cleaning .
go to your room ...
now !
how dare you disrespect me ?
i got you off the streets .
the streets ?
i live at 59th and park .
whatever .
you are never to set foot in this house again ,
and you are never to see my daughter again .
understood ?
first of all , i never touched your daughter .
second , i' d like to think you could look beyond racial lines .
don' t give me that racist crap .
we gave money to colin powell .
i guess that puts me in my place .
thank you for your hospitality .
it was a true awakening .
the black man is gone !
praise jesus , the black man is gone !
i never knew she felt this way .
you' re a lucky guy .
what do i do ?
tell her you love her .
mrs caldwell will have me shot if i go near her .
i don' t even know her e mail address .
e mail is for geeks and paedophiles .
be romantic , write another letter .
how will it get to her ?
we' il make sure she gets it .
why are you doing this for me ?
because ...
we want to see cecile happy .
we know that you' d make her happy .
you' d make any girl happy .
you mind if i have some privacy ?
my room' s across the hall .
make yourself at home .
who are you calling ?
cecile .
what are you doing ?
you know the damage we' il cause ?
i' m aware .
are you really ?
we' ve done some fucked up shit , but this is ...
we' re destroying an innocent girl .
court reynolds is going down .
if you won' t help me , someone else will .
you amaze me .
eat me , sebastian .
you guys can fuck everyone , but i get dumped for twits like cecile .
god forbid i exude confidence and enjoy sex .
i must act like mary sunshine 24 7 so i can be considered a lady .
i' m the marcia brady of the east side and i want to kill myself .
there' s your psychoanalysis , dr freud .
now tell me , are you in , or are you out ?
call her .
it' s kathryn .
okay , stop crying .
stop crying .
hold on for sebastian .
cecile ?
stop crying .
listen to me very carefully .
i have a letter from ronald .
he asked me to give it to you .
i can' t bring it to your house , your mother despises me , so listen ...
finished .
this doesn' t taste like ice tea .
it' s from long lsland .
how' s the letter ?
it' s excellent .
do you think he' il like it ?
he' il love it .
are you kidding ?
what are you doing ?
just taking a photo .
you know , you could be a model .
really ?
too bad you' re not sexy .
i can be sexy .
all right , show me sexy .
wow , that' s very sexy .
make yourself more comfortable .
no , no .
come here .
now that' s sexy .
cecile , you know what would be super duper sexy ?
if you lost all the clothes .
i don' t think so .
sorry , that was out of line .
i think i should go home now .
i' il have your mom pick you up .
you can' t call my mom .
wow , she doesn' t know you' re here .
in fact , you' re probably grounded .
i think i should call her anyway .
i' il do anything .
don' t call !
cecile ...
all i want to do is give you a kiss .
just a kiss ?
i swear .
what are you doing ?
you promised to let me kiss you .
but then why ...
i don' t want to kiss you here .
i want to kiss you there .
a promise is a promise , cecile .
a promise is a promise ...
it tickles .
cecile , are you up yet ?
you' re going to be late for the ...
cecile ?
i need a hug .
cecile ?
yeah .
jesus , where have you been ?
shopping .
hurry up .
you' re supposed to be at mrs rosemond' s before brunch .
she' s very important at the school , and i want you to look your best .
afternoon , ladies .
i didn' t know you' d be here .
why waste such a lovely day in the city ?
good point .
anyone for tennis ?
excuse me .
that was rude .
she' s very strange .
what am i going to do ?
is something wrong ?
mrs collins is short of volunteers at the retirement home .
but i have theatre tickets .
that' s terrible .
i have a thought .
why don' t you two fill in for me ?
i' d love to .
you two are the best .
thank you .
it' s so sweet of you .
i can' t help it .
isn' t he beautiful ?
it' s wonderful when you young people help out .
most of our patients have no family nearby .
mr gottlieb , we have a visitor for you .
no , i' ve got somebody special for you , baby .
did i ever tell you the time when my late husband ...
yes , mrs sugerman , you did .
right after we played backgammon .
we played backgammon ?
you beat me three times .
then i fucked your daughter .
excuse me ?
i said , " care for some water ?
no , thank you .
come in .
how' s it going in here ?
we played backgammon , and i won three times .
that' s the way to go !
isn' t it wonderful ?
i told you she was special .
that was fun .
i actually feel good about myself .
mrs sugerman is cool .
come on .
mrs sugerman is cool ?
you must think i' m an idiot .
no .
you had a good time with her ?
i did .
we played backgammon .
all right , i was bored out of my mind .
i hate doing charity .
it' s okay .
that doesn' t make you a bad person .
i can' t win with you .
it' s not about winning , sebastian .
your problem is , you take yourself too seriously .
i do not .
yes , you do .
try to lighten up .
i am .
can we drop this ?
what are you doing ?
stop it .
it' s distracting .
cut it out .
stop it .
are you smiling ?
no .
will you stop !
you can relax .
i promise i won' t tell anybody .
who is it ?
it' s kathryn .
are you okay ?
no !
what' s wrong ?
something bad happened last night .
what do you mean ?
i don' t think you want to know .
cecile , you have to tell me .
it involves your brother .
he ...
he took advantage of me .
why didn' t you do something ?
i don' t know .
you came to our house late at night , and he forced intercourse on you .
not exactly .
he made you give him a blowjob ?
no ...
what , then ?
he took down my panties and wrote the alphabet with his tongue .
he went down on you ?
if that' s what you call it .
well , did you like it ?
no .
i don' t know , it was weird .
at first it felt icky ,
and then it was sort of okay .
then i started getting really hot , and then i started shaking ...
it was weird , it just felt like an explosion ...
but a good one .
cecile , you had an orgasm .
i did ?
you' re becoming a woman .
i am ?
cecile !
now that you' re on your way , it would be stupid of you to stop .
think of sebastian as a tutor .
let him instruct you .
but i don' t love him .
i love ronald .
don' t you want to make ronald happy ?
practice makes perfect , cecile .
my advice is to sleep with as many people as possible .
that would make me a slut ...
wouldn' t it ?
cecile , everybody does it .
it' s just that nobody talks about it .
like a secret society ?
that' s one way of looking at it .
fucking idiot ...
cool .
secret society , secret society ...
am i supposed to feel this sore ?
just the first time .
it' il pass .
i like it better when i' m on top .
cecile ...
this is what i call " quiet time " , when we reflect on what we' ve done .
sorry .
something' s the matter ?
you think ?
is it me ?
no , you were fine .
it' s that annette girl .
you love her , don' t you ?
it' s okay .
i don' t love you , either .
i love ronald .
where are you going ?
i' m taking a shower .
want company ?
no .
want a blowjob ?
good night , cecile .
prude ...
who are you spying on ?
is that her ?
yeah .
she' s crying .
little baby' s upset by the big bad book .
shut up .
what' s up your ass ?
nothing .
she' s getting to you , isn' t she ?
if you must know , yes .
i can' t stand her holy bullshit , yet i' m totally infatuated with her .
she made me laugh .
that' s why you' re losing our bet ?
no .
it' s just taking longer than i expected .
do you mind if i take my new car for a ride ?
kathryn ...
the only thing you' re going to be riding is me .
if you' il excuse me , i have some work to do .
bonjour , mademoiselle .
bonjour , monsieur valmont .
i' m sorry about that .
i am too .
you know what ?
i' m not sorry .
i thought we' d just be friends .
i can' t keep my feelings all bottled up like you .
do you honestly feel nothing for me ?
i have feelings for you .
then what' s wrong ?
it' s not like you have a husband , unless you' re married to jesus .
why can' t we be together ?
do you really want to know why ?
it' s because i don' t trust myself with you .
come in .
i just came to say goodbye .
where are you going ?
back to the city .
maybe to france for the end of the summer .
i can' t take your games anymore .
what games ?
come off it .
you' re hot one minute , cold the next ...
you make me feel inadequate .
then i guess it' s best you leave .
sebastian ...
i don' t want us to part on bad terms .
i' m afraid you don' t have a choice in the matter .
i don' t associate with hypocrites .
how am i a hypocrite ?
you spend all your time preaching about waiting for love .
now you' re turning your back on it .
so i guess we' re just fucked .
i' il move on , but you' il always know that you turned your back on love .
that makes you a hypocrite .
have a nice life .
wait ...
i' m sorry , i can' t .
get it together , you pussy .
morning .
morning .
so , how did it go last night ?
with who ?
not cecile , i know all about that .
no , i didn' t nail her .
she shot you down ?
exactly the opposite .
what went wrong ?
i don' t know .
she was lying on the bed , ready to do it , and i was ...
i just didn' t feel right about it .
you had your chance , and didn' t ?
she' s not in her room .
where is she ?
she left 30 minutes ago .
where did she go ?
she told your aunt she was going to stay with friends .
you blew it .
that girl' s come to her senses .
she' il never go near you again .
stupid , stupid ...
judy " .
i' il save that one .
it' s valmont .
is she with you ?
no , i don' t know where she is .
why don' t you leave her alone ?
where is she ?
she' s staying with the mihallaks .
she caught a train into penn station about 20 minutes ago .
i' m impressed .
i' m in love .
are you okay ?
just a minute .
come in .
bad time ?
kind of .
you invited me in so i could witness your little adventure .
who is our friend who gives you such pleasure ?
where could he be ?
fucked up shit in this house ...
call me .
you don' t get to have all the fun .
i assume you' ve come here to make arrangements .
some other time .
excuse me ?
i' m not in the mood .
i want to fuck .
and i don' t .
good afternoon , kathryn .
sounds great .
i love you , too .
i love you , too ...
you' re completely pussy whipped .
stop it .
what happened to us ?
nothing has changed .
yes , it has .
you don' t love me anymore .
come on , it' s just a bet .
this is ridiculous .
you' re ridiculous , dear brother .
look what you' ve been reduced to .
what' il happen when school starts ?
you' re dating miss seventeen magazine , the headmaster' s daughter .
before you know it , you' il be giving campus tours with her .
her father doesn' t know about your past , does he ?
i doubt he' d let his little princess be seen with you .
it' s disappointing to see annette' s manifesto was a total sham .
as student body president , i feel it' s my duty to tell him .
put the phone down .
this won' t take a second .
quite the predicament you' re in .
i was planning on telling her everything this afternoon .
that' s right , i forgot .
you' re so in love .
you honestly believe you' ve changed in the few days you' ve known her ?
let me tell you something .
people don' t change overnight .
you and i are two of a kind .
i' m not afraid to admit it .
you were going to leave school a legend , now you' il leave a joke .
i' m willing to take my chances .
don' t do it , sebastian .
you won' t only ruin your reputation , you' il destroy hers .
this is my room .
can we be quiet ?
i have something to tell you .
tell me .
this isn' t working out for me .
yeah , me neither .
what' s wrong ?
it' s me .
i' m completely fucked up .
what are you saying ?
i thought i was in love with you , but it was just a lie .
i wanted it to work , but unfortunately i feel nothing .
why are you doing this ?
i wanted to get you into bed .
you don' t mean that .
you know nothing .
you don' t even know me .
the fact is , there is someone i love .
you don' t even compare to her .
i don' t believe you .
i don' t know how to make it clearer .
you mean nothing to me .
you were just ...
you were just a conquest .
you' re such a coward .
look , you' re shaking .
is that what you came to tell me ?
i' m sorry .
i' m completely ...
you' re completely fucked up .
get out .
get out !
don' t touch me ...
don' t touch me .
don' t fucking touch me , sebastian !
just leave .
jesus ...
a bit melodramatic , don' t you think ?
i thought you' d like to know what happened with annette .
it' s over .
really ?
you were right .
i can' t change .
you and i are two of a kind .
i thought we should celebrate .
sorry .
i' m expecting some company .
who ?
ronald ?
not that it concerns you , but yes .
from ronald .
i haven' t had a chance to read it ,
you mean a lot to me , i hope we can be friends , etc .
i expected this shit , so i took the liberty of getting them together .
you were right .
you do get dumped for the innocent little twits .
well done .
thank you .
now ...
where were we ?
oh yes , the celebration .
what shall we toast to ?
to my triumph .
not my choice , but it' s your call .
to your triumph over annette .
what' s so funny ?
silly boy ...
my triumph isn' t over her .
it' s over you .
again ?
you were very much in love with her .
and you' re still in love with her .
but it amused me to make you ashamed of it .
you gave up your first love because i threatened your reputation .
don' t you get it ?
you' re just a toy , sebastian .
a little toy i like to play with .
and now you' ve blown it with her .
i think it' s the saddest thing i' ve ever heard .
cheers .
it tastes good .
you came to make arrangements , but i don' t fuck losers .
goodbye , sebastian .
it' s imperative i talk to her .
she' s not here .
will you please tell her i called ?
of course i will .
yes ?
i need to speak to annette .
she' s not here .
i' m entertaining some guests ...
i already told you she is not here .
will you see she gets this ?
yes .
it' s really important .
i understand .
i' m terribly sorry .
you never know who' s going to show up here .
dear annette , what can i say to rectify the harm i' ve caused you ?
being with you was the only time i' ve ever been happy .
my whole life has been a joke .
i prided myself on taking joy in others ' misery .
well , it finally backfired .
i succeeded in hurting the first person i loved .
enclosed is my most prized possession .
myjournal .
i considered it my trophy .
a collection of my conquests .
if you want to know the truth , please read it .
no more lies .
please give me another chance .
i' m a wreck without you .
ronald ?
it' s kathryn .
what' s up ?
is everything okay ?
no .
it' s sebastian .
he' s out of his mind .
he hit me , then he took off .
i' m afraid to be alone .
ronald , i really need you .
settle down .
there' s more .
it involves cecile .
stay there .
i' il be right over .
son of a bitch ...
valmont !
hey , ronald .
we have some talking to do .
later .
i' ve had a real bad night .
what' s your problem ?
why did you hit kathryn ?
she got to you , too ...
you don' t know what you' re saying .
she also said you fucked cecile .
it' s true , isn' t it ?
ronald , i' m sorry ...
sebastian ?
sebastian !
stop it !
annette !
sebastian ...
i love you , annette .
i love you , too .
just hold on ...
as the new headmaster of manchester prep
it saddens me to start our new year with such a mournful tone .
i didn' t know anyone was in here .
i' m sorry .
annette hargrove .
kathryn merteuil .
have we met ?
i don' t think so .
your father' s the new headmaster ?
that' s right .
i' m sorry to hear about your brother .
are you okay ?
i' il be fine .
did you know sebastian ?
you might say that .
such a tragedy , isn' t it ?
yes , it is .
i' il leave you alone now .
i' m here if you need a friend .
that' s great .
sometimes when i feel i can' t go on ,
i turn to jesus , and he helps me through it .
thank you .
i' il see you around campus .
looking forward to it ... ... freak .
here we go .
however dark the cloud , there' s always a silver lining .
it might be hard to see , but what we should learn from this
is to be true to ourselves and to resist peer pressure .
as student body president i' ve tried to set an example in myself .
unfortunately , i couldn' t reach out to my stepbrother in time .
i know he' s looking down on us today and ...
i know he' d want me to say ...
he' d want me to say , " kathryn ...
he' d want me to say , " kathryn , i' m sorry .
what is going on ?
don' t you have any respect ?
