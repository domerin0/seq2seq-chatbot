look at you .
you wanna change your life so you come to hear the story .
high school popularity ain' t a contest , i\ x9ds a war .
dizzy harrison is its greatest casualty .
see , his story is really my story .
because behind every so called hero ... ... is a little pissed off dude that don' t get no credit !
we have to go back a ways .
even as a small child , dizzy harrison had his own particular style .
as you can see , i didn' t have a lot to work with .
i hurt myself !
things didn' t get any better from there .
as the years went by , he got taller , whiter , skinnier .
first day , senior year .
and we' re gonna be the top dogs .
i wish i' d drowned this summer .
we all do , kirk .
we' il always be blips .
blips ?
we' re barely on the radar !

we' re seniors now .
i' m with dizzy on this one .
i\ x9ds never too late to make a change .

type .
you know those moments when a man makes ... ... a decision tha\ x9dil change his life ... ... and he steps up to become the hero he was meant to be ?

tourette' s syndrome ?

i\ x9ds going to take a lot of hugs and a lot of drugs .
only take one of these a day .
nice pack .
there he is .
diz ?
they gave me these pills for my tourette' s , but they' re not working .

i' ve been in the pen a while .
everything you saw on that screen was completely ... ... true .
they' re right .
i' m a liar .
i don' t know what i was thinking .
actually , i do know what i was thinking .
i was trying to become something more than just a blip on the radar screen .
so i made someone up .
someone i thought you' d all like .
and all because i cared more about what other people thought of me ... ... than what i thought of me .
but i bet i' m not the only person here who' s ever let that happen .
what is this ?
broke dick , broke dick !
broke dick , broke dick !
better come scoop up your friend .
move it !
anybody got a staple gun ?
who' s the bitch now ?
diz !
oh , my god , you' re bleeding !

they don' t boo when they' re killing something .
diz , you are amazing .
what was that for ?
can' t i appreciate you ?
you' re scaring me .
wha\ x9ds going on ?
you' ve inspired me .
i have to do something i' ve wanted to do a long time .
i have to let somebody know how i feel about him .
you know , nora ...
better than playstation 2 ?

yo , i guess i\ x9ds me and you .
and us .
and me .
would you two get a room ?
i' m sorry .
i don' t know what to call you .
broke dick seems to be popular .
you' re the biggest liar i' ve ever met .
you' re right , i' m a liar .
they called me " dan the man .
what ?
that was before i lost the braces and grew boobs .
then i became " danielle the body .
i dropped all the friends i had because they looked like the old me .
and very selfish and mean ... ... but i just wanted so badly to fit in .
been there .
do you even ride the motorcycle ?
yeah , actually i do .
but it usually takes a station wagon or a bush to stop me .
so , what do we do now ?
don' t ask me .
the last plan i had blew up pretty badly .
no kidding .
so you see ... ... i saved his narrow behind .
and he got to kiss the girl .
i hope that inspires you .
it has .
i\ x9ds taught me a lot .
i\ x9ds easy for a man like me to forget what most slobs will do to get a woman .
my fault , i talk too much .
that really did burn me , sorry .
oh , god !
you okay ?
no , he clipped it .
tha\ x9ds why i wanna use you .
you staring at my janet ?
no .
no way , man !
can we do that again ?
he couldn' t understand what i said .
i' m sorry , that sucked !
look at that !
don' t yell for mercy .
oh , god , i blew the line .
check me out !
bat wings !

cut !
i need three gallons of mineral water ... ... 16 martini olives ... ... and enough hummus to cover this beautiful girl' s body .
