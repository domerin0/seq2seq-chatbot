horton !
you and otter locate the reactors and fire them up .
what is that ?
outpost incinerator .
move away from the door !
why are you still here , soldier ?
probably because no one lit the furnace .
captain v. j. dax .
says here he' s a big hero .
combat medals , bronze stars , purple heart , purple heart , purple heart .
federal medal of valour at widowmakers .
that' s a lot of crap .
wounded four times , refused numerous battlefield commissions ...
give me that .
some hero .
you murdered colonel hohlback ?
he had his morita and a sidearm .
i just used my hands .
you' re a disgrace to the uniform .
he' s a mad dog .
he stays in the cage .
just remember , lieutenant , every dog has its day !
sarge !
hostiles !
i am in command here , private .

trooper !

you two !
with me on flank !
perimeter burn in 10 seconds .
perimeter burn in 10 seconds .
look out !
come on !
three .
two .
one .
zero .
perimeter burn .
i need two volunteers .
who do you think you are ?
the big stick that' s running this show .
i' il go .
me too .
if we' re not back inside of five minutes , it means more bugs are on the way .
you mean we didn' t kill them all ?
you never kill them all , son .
all right , who' s got ... ?
a light .
otter , take a knee .
you see those busted wires there ?
yes , sir .
you got the wiggle room , kid .
splice them together .
trooper , hand me that ...
where' s your knife ?
i must have lost it , sir .
anyone who loses his knife in my unit would be strung up for lashes , kid .
you want to be careful with the red wire .
we got movement !
horton , illumination round .
hold your fire , we' re coming through !
it' s the general .
i see him !
he' s bringing home two .
he' s bringing home three .
wonder who didn' t make it .
hope it wasn' t goldy .
he was nice to me on my first day .
it' s those little things that count .
yeah , like doing your goddamn job .
hostiles !
right on your general' s ass !
come on , kid !
outstanding .
that stinks !
you get so you like it after a while .
son , i' il never forget it .
me neither , sir .
what kind of a hole do you think i am ?
put her there !
welcome back , sir .
i don' t know who you are , but you' re aces with me .
it' s nothing personal , general .
i' m just doing my job .
hey , fellas , let me give you a hand .
hell , i got a dog back home weighs more than she does .
well , look what the cat drug in !
you should see that damn cat !
we' re in the shitter , huh ?
we got a chance .
good to see you .
want the bad news or the bad news ?
i almost forgot your knife .
keep it , kid .
no , i couldn' t .
trooper needs a knife .
officers just tell troopers where to die .
that' s not really true , is it , sir ?
watch out for officers , son .
it' s their job to get you killed .
first wave came in , and deke and slater were killed .
came in again and that ...
that kid goldy was gone .
and then it was just ... ... me and o' hara .
that magnificent son of a bitch .
we held them .
i tell you , this ... ... star don' t mean a hill of beans when you' re caught between shit and sweat .
and then these two beautiful bastards show up .
these two here , and they' re carrying a couple of grenades ... ... and they got a boatload of gumption .
and they saved my sorry ass !
and i' d like to introduce you to them .
this is corporal joe griff , medical corps .
and this is technical sergeant ari peck .
and i can' t tell you a thing about sleeping beauty over here ... ... because she snored through the whole damn thing .
that' s private soda , sir .
she didn' t sleep after our unit got chopped down .
found peck the next day , what , about five days ago ?
everybody' s gotta sleep sometime .
what' s your story , peck ?
32nd tech brigade , sole survivor , sir !
that' s me .
been out there about a month , near as i can tell .
that' s a long time .
pretty long , yeah .
i guess .
well , then , we got to get you home .
lieutenant dill .
yes , sir !
has pickup been arranged ?
sergeant peck , can i talk to you ?
yes , sir ?
you think you can make this com talk and squawk like it ought to ?
well , you can bet i' il die trying , sir .
get some sleep and try later .
oh , no , no .
i' il get on this right now .
that' s outstanding , sergeant !
you' re a credit to your mobile infantry unit .
thank you .
when is the last time you took a shower ?
let' s worry about the sniff factor after we get our asses unslung .
yes , sir .
we could sit pretty tight if we could shut this door , sergeant .
i' il get someone on it .
at least there' s one man looking in the right direction .
yes , sir .
what' s wrong with her , corporal ?
it' s the wind , sir .
dries out the membranes .
she' il be fine when she wakes up .
she' s got the right idea .
good night , troopers .
get some sleep , all of you !
that' s an order .
and , dill ...
yes , sir .
i want a full report of today' s action when i wake up ... ... explaining how you got five of my troopers killed .
yes , sir .
you heard the man .
hit the sack !
not you , trooper .
yes , sir ?
letting that criminal loose is a court martial offence , private .
i thought he could help us .
you thought the judgment of a murderer was preferable to an officer' s ?
well , that' il make for a hell of a compelling defence .
i wasn' t thinking , sir .
it was intuition .
intuition ?
i had no idea you were psychic .
i scored high when i was a kid , sir .
really ?
why aren' t you wearing the black ?
i became inconsistent , sir .
onset of puberty ?
it happens to you women .
when is it gonna happen to you ?
excuse me ?
puberty .
i hear it' s a necessary step on the way to becoming a man .
you' re addressing an officer of the federation .
shove that officer crap up your buster brown .
an officer who behaves as you did today ... ... and takes it out on a trooper ain' t a man !
i' m not a man ?
what kind of a man turns his back on the federation ?
i' m glad you asked .
i trained a generation of people to throw themselves into the grinder .
the federation chewed them up and spit them out .
so now when they say , " push on to glory , " i say , " what glory ?
what would you know about glory ?
you call yourself a hero ?
no , son .
that' s something other people call you , and it' s really just a trick .
when you throw your life away , instead of fool , they call you hero .
and as for glory , ask her .
she' il tell you everything you need to know !
how dare you ?
just one man' s opinion .
no , it' s not .
it' s treason !
then maybe you ought to shoot me .
now , there' s something we agree on .
well , go ahead .
take out that popgun and have at it , soldier .
i believe in the rules and regulations that the federation stands for .
very good , lieutenant !
but you left out the kids .
what ?
cowards .
they always hide behind rules and children .
i' il see you hang !
just so long as it' s regulation rope .
oh , let' s see .
got your mystery meat sticks , egg caps , hardtack , beans .
insta veggie meal , choco pudding delite .
sweet tooth , huh ?
taps in 15 minutes .
i' il get you !
nice to have you with us , trooper .
you' ve been out for a long time .
how you feeling ?
i feel good , sir .
you fit for duty ?
raring to go .
well , that' s outstanding .
what' s the eta on a door we can shut , gentlemen ?
well , sir , i think that should do it .
if you' il hold on ...
watch out for the cables !
the cables .
stop it !
stop it !
do it , do it , do it .
shit .
great , you welded the damn thing open .
you idiots .
all personnel to the perimeter .
troopers , you heard the man .
let' s go !
get moving !
take that weapon .
come on .
sandee , horton , soda , brick , come on , you lazy bastards .
let' s move it .
move , move , move , move !
sahara .
you two over there , you two front and running .
where' s my op ?
man your post !
go , go , go !
what' s wrong ?
general , there' s something ...
move !
scouting parties , sir , 100 metres out .
when they figure that fence is down ... ... they' re gonna show up like relatives to a rich man' s funeral .
let there be light .
yeah .
yeah !
here we go .
we got power .
that' s what i' m talking about .
i can see you now .
hey , general ?
peck , is this your doing ?
it' s a little wonky ... ... but it' il hold .
i hope .
you have our tremendous gratitude , peck .
oh , it was nothing , sir .
i' il get back to work on the com now .
attaboy , peck .
way to go , peck .
peck .
peck .
peck .
all right .
dax , the charges against you are serious ... ... but i can' t afford to lose a man of your experience .
give me your word as an officer you' il do your duty .
i' m no longer an officer , general , but i' il give you my word as a man .
your rank is restored until your guilt or innocence ... ... is determined by a hearing .
well , i can assure you i killed colonel hohlback .
then i guarantee you' il hang , but until then , i expect you to do your duty .
yes , sir .
i want forward op .
three watches a day .
fences fail , troopers get lazy .
you carry on , captain .
yes , sir .
something i can do for you ?
i just came to say thanks for saving my ass .
that' s the job .
how come you don' t sleep inside like everyone else ?
i figure this is where the enemy will show up .
no telling what kind of fun you could get in out here , huh ?
are you flirting with me , soldier ?
no , sir , i don' t flirt .
never ?
never ever , sir .
well , you' re the real deal .
the genuine article .
and you want some action .
you' il get all the action you want after the bugs show up .
you know ... ... it' s all the waiting that gets me .
oh , i see .
you need something to occupy your mind .
come here .
that' s good right there .
drop and give me 100 .
sir ?
you got a lot of energy , trooper .
now get down and start counting .
yes , sir .
one , two , three , four ... ... five , six , seven ...
make it 200 .
you lose something ?
yo , you' re the new guy , so i ...
can we play too ?
i got mess duty .
thanks for the wake up , soda .
pleasure .
you sure you know what you' re doing ?
oh , i got a pretty good idea , but ... ... you know , practice does make perfect .
nice .
come on , billie .
no , no , forget it , sandee .
he' s a jerk .
hey , sandee ...
what' s with her ?
horton' s with the new girl .
sipping some soda .
ain' t war hell ?
who goes there ?
horton ?
oh , it' s you .
sorry .
you okay ?
no .
anything i can do ?
no .
at least let me take a look at that cut on your chin .
this ?
it' s just a scratch .
general wants everybody tiptop .
hey , joe ?
yeah ?
how long have you been out here ?
all my life , it seems like .
yeah , i know what you mean .
i' ve been here for eight months , and i' ve only seen the sun twice .
might be a little easier if you took your helmet off , jill .
god , what happened to your fingers ?
you know , muzzle burn .
that looks really bad .
hey , who' s the medic here anyway , huh ?
hey , joe .
yeah ?
has anybody ever told you what a nice smile you have ?
yeah .
probably .
feeling better ?
no .
do you want to ?
what happened to her , corporal ?
just a nosebleed , sir .
she' s gonna be fine .
how do you feel ?
you know how i feel .
what gives ?
it looks like we got a couple new couples .
no wonder we' re losing this war .
everyone' s fucking instead of fighting .
what are you looking at ?
get back to work .
i' il get to work .
good morning , captain .
what makes you think so ?
why , are we in for it ?
sooner or later .
you got time for breakfast ?
you' re welcome to join me , as long as you don' t expect cheerful conversation .
not a morning person , huh ?
no , i' m a miserable , murdering bastard .
and that' s on a good day .
what' s a bad day like ?
any one day in particular you' re interested in ?
no .
that second lieu y send you to question me ?
lieutenant dill ?
he thinks i' m an idiot .
are you ?
me ?
yeah .
definitely .
trust me , i got you beat .
well , i fell in love , and i got busted down from corporal for fraternisation .
so who wants to be a corporal ?
here' s the idiot part .
he got killed .
you really some kind of psychic ?
yeah .
maybe .
i guess .
not like dill , not psi corps .
well , your fella ... ... did you know he was gonna buy the farm ?
it doesn' t work that way .
well , that' s good , i guess .
maybe that' s why i don' t believe in all that bunk .
those tags belong to the troopers that you lost ... ... and you wear them because you feel responsible for what happened .
that' s a lucky guess .
why' d you kill your co ?
you tell me .
i' m not that good .
he gave some stupid orders that got kids killed .
one day too many , or too many one day .
maybe i' m the wheel that broke .
you ought to forgive yourself .
it' s war .
don' t spend too much time around me , trooper .
i' d hate to end up wearing your tags .
stupid bug .
you' re relieved .
thanks .
hey ...
hey , trooper ?
who' s that ?
peck .
hey , sarge , what do you need ?
well , i could use a hand .
buddy , anything i can do for you is aces by me .
you think you could lie down on the fl ... ?
the floor ?
floor .
and reach behind the cons ...
i got it , i got it .
you want me to lay on the floor and reach behind the console .
okay .
here we go .
son of a ...
how' s this ?
oh , god !
help !
gotta keep quiet .
help !
help !
we got com .
we got com .
this is hotel delta 185 to fleet rescue .
come in , fleet rescue .
this is hotel delta 185 to fleet rescue .
this is ...
how' s that report coming ?
well , i' m not so much writing a report as building your gallows , dax .
i didn' t take you for a carpenter .
shift to command frequency .
there was this other carpenter a few thousand years ago ... ... a better man than you or me .
well , that carpentry business was the death of him .
be careful of what you build and what crosses you bear .
hotel delta 185 to fleet command .
lieutenant .
roger , hotel delta , this is fleet command .
over .
this is the 701 st mobile infantry , bravo company , requesting pickup .
tak e a number , ml .
we got stragglers all over the planet .
what' s your name , sailor ?
fleet lieutenant mary klinghof .
getting smart won' t help you , jarhead .
you listen up , fruit fly .
this is general jack gordon shepherd .
and if somebody doesn' t make this pickup their priority ... ... i' m gonna make it my priority to come down ... ... and chew out some fleet ass , starting with you .
sorry , sir , i didn' t know who i was talking to .
that' s because you' re a moron .
yeah .
yes , sir , but we got a lot of wounded out there .
the wounded come first .
any excuses after that come out of your butt .
shepherd , out .
where' s peck ?
i' m gonna give him a medal .
asleep , sir .
dead on his feet .
well , he' s earned it .
any day on that door , brick .
we' re all waiting for something , sarge .
but it ain' t the door .
outstanding .
not you , trooper .
lucky guess .
we' re all gonna die .
what would you know about glory ?
it doesn' t work that way .
lf he won' t fight , shoot him !
no !
sahara .
i haven' t seen him .
wak e up .
the wheel that brok e .
wak e up .
wak e up .
give me a little more .
don' t be shy .
come on .
yeah .
oh , trouble at the trough .
it' s gonna get ugly .
what' s eating tor , huh ?
not you .
yeah , i guess you' re right .
war does some weird things to people .
everything okay ?
no , i' m ...
yeah , i' m fine .
you look a little shaky , trooper .
yeah , something' s not right .
that' s what they call it when you' re behind enemy lines .
it feels worse than that .
oh , is this another one of your psychic hot flashes ?
it seems like tor has changed .
because he wouldn' t take brick' s bait ?
about time .
it seems sudden , sarge .
like you puking your guts out ?
i guess i' m coming down with something .
i wonder what that could be ?
there' s a big knot ... ... where my stomach used to be .
sarge , i barely touched the medic' s hand just now , and i saw something .
you saw something ?
something terrible .
maybe you' re just going crazy .
i love you too , sarge .
girls get wacky when they' re pregnant .
suddenly , they know everything about everything .
oh , jesus .
yeah , you' re about as psychic as a doorknob , trooper .
you ready ?
i' m kind of tired .
i' il give you a hand .
oh , thanks .
oh , my shoe .
don' t worry about it .
are you scared to shower , otter ?
what does it matter ?
we' re going home in a few hours anyway .
hi , guys .
holy god , what the ... ?
oh , god .
oh , god .
open the door !
open the door !
we' re gonna die in here !
open the door !
captain , i need to talk to you , but it' s gonna sound crazy .
well , spit it out , trooper .
look , sir ... ... i know i' m not really supposed to be psychic ... ... but i have this terrible feeling .
yes , sir .
as you were .
we have a situation here that requires the attention of military intelligence .
tell him .
this morning , in the mess ... ... i accidentally touched griff' s hand .
i might' ve had a vision .
playing psychic again , private ?
could you keep an open mind here , lieutenant ?
this trooper' s got information that' s vital .
some of the troopers have been acting a little strange lately .
describe what you saw .
he wasn' t a man .
he was some other thing .
maybe 1000 things .
somehow he was connected ... ... to tor and sandee and horton and that new girl , soda .
i' ve always been pretty fuzzy , sir , and this came through sharp as a knife .
lieutenant , i know i' m not a real psychic like you .
in fact , i just found out i' m pregnant , and i didn' t have a clue .
you' re pregnant ?
yes , sir , i' m afraid so .
you might be interested to know that in our studies ... ... pregnancy has been shown to heighten psychic ability .
that' s too bad because i' d really like to be wrong .
yes , me too , but i keep having the same feeling .
what is it ?
they' re coming to wipe us out .
what' s so new about that ?
i mean the whole species , everything human .
and they have a plan .
look , after what i did in the battle ... ... i wasn' t very sure of myself anymore .
and i just figured everybody thought i' d just cracked .
yesterday , i might have been inclined to agree ... ... but that would' ve been me screwing up , lieutenant .
thank you , sir .
i' il get on this matter with general shepherd immediately .
oh , and , trooper ... ... that was some good work .
sir .
general shepherd ?
what are you doing in here ?
general jack and i were just having a chat .
what are you doing here , dill ?
you and shepherd ?
is that so hard to believe ?
general ?
general shepherd ?
general ...
they' re inside of you .
oh , god .
back up , or i' il drill your damn skull .
get back !
get away from the door .
get away .
you bastards .
you' re all under arrest ... ... for murder , sedition , for treason against the federation ...
oh , and you' re gonna pay because we' re not gonna kill you .
oh , no .
no , you see , we got special places for things like you ... ... where they cut you up .
but they keep you alive while they cut you up ... ... so they can see what makes you tick , and they' il see what makes you sick .
and i' il be there .
oh , yeah , i' m gonna be there to see ...
you' re under arrest , dax .
on what charge ?
murder .
captain dax , what' s happening ?
no talking to the prisoner .
keep him covered .
you gave me your word , dax .

sahara , you okay ?
poor creatures .
why must we destroy you ?
i' il tell you why .
order is the tide of creation ... ... but yours is a species ... ... that worships the one over the many .
you glorify your intelligence ... ... because it allows you to believe anything .
that you have a destiny .
that you have a right .
that you have a cause .
that you are special .
that you are great .
but in truth ... ... you are born insane .
and such misery ... ... cannot be allowed ... ... to spread .
kill them all !
sahara !

general shepherd !

you can' t take him !
whatever you do , don' t let him onboard !
hey , general !
listen up .
she needs medical attention .
you just killed a general officer , mister !
lots of generals out there , flyboy !
this trooper' s got information vital to the survival of the federation !
she must reach safety at all costs !
you get me ?
yes , sir !
let' s go !
there are too many of them , dax !
you gotta tell them what you saw .
you gotta tell them about the new bug !
you stay here , you' il die !
murderers don' t go home .
dax !
dax !
dax .
more than a soldier , not just a man .
a hero of the federation .
shed no tears for me .
my glory lives forever .
and now you too can live the glory ... ... because it' s easy to be a hero in the mobile infantry .
men and women lik e you are signing up every day ... ... to serve the federation and save the galaxy !
isn' t it time you did your part ?
beautiful baby , ma' am .
thank you , sergeant .
think how impressed friends and teachers will be !
everyone loves a citizen !
little trooper likes me .
