mary jane watson .

look , you are my only hope , all right ?
you have to make it in time .
peter , you' re a nice guy .
but you' re just not dependable .
this is your last chance .
you have to go 42 blocks in 7 1/ 2 minutes or your ass is fired .

hey , what , are you stupid ?
whoa !
he stole that guy' s pizzas !
i' m gonna get it !
hey , you guys .
no playing in the streets .
yes , mr. spider man .

i' m not paying for those .
joe' s 29 minute guarantee is a promise , man .
i know to you , parker , a promise means nothing .

it' s serious to me too , mr. aziz .
you' re fired .
go .
please , i need this job .
you' re fired .
look , give me another chance .
you' re fired .
parker , hello .
you' re fired .

parker , hello .
you' re fired .

dogs catching frisbees ?
pigeons in the park ?
a couple geezers playing chess ?
boss .
not now .
the bugle could show another side of new york for a change .
we got six minutes to deadline , jonah .
we need page one .
i don' t pay you to be a sensitive artiste .
i pay you still not now !
i pay you because that psycho spider man will pose for you .
he won' t let me take any more pictures .
you turned the whole city against him .
a fact i' m very proud of .
get your pretty little portfolio off my desk before i go into a diabetic coma .
it' s your wife , she lost her checkbook .
thanks for the good news .
please , isn' t there any of these shots you can use ?
i need the money .
miss brant .
get me a violin .
five minutes to deadline , jonah .
run a picture of a rancid chicken .
food poisoning scare sweeps city .
some food got poisoned ?
i' m a little nauseous .
all right , mr. jameson .
it stinks .
robbie , there' s your page one .
masked menace terrorizes town .
i told you , he' s not a menace .
i told you  i' il take care of it .
i' il give you 150 .
three hundred .
that' s outrageous .
done .
give this to the girl .
thank you .
bye bye .
hi .
hey , pete .
i don' t think this covers the advance i gave you a couple weeks ago .
right .
sorry .
hey .
chin up , okay ?

dr. connors .
sorry .
where were you headed , parker ?
to your class .
my class is over .
see me standing here ?
i' m sorry .
i' m trying .
i wanna be here .
then be here .
look at you , peter .
your grades have been steadily declining .
you' re late for class .
you always appear exhausted .
your paper on fusion is still overdue .
i know .
i' m planning to write it on dr. otto octavius .
planning is not a major at this university .
octavius is a friend of mine .
better do your research , parker .
get it done , or i' m failing you .
surprise !
well , say something .
what' s the occasion ?
really , peter .
it' s your birthday !
whether you want to remember it or not .
he lives in another reality .
don' t you , pete ?
hi , m. j. hi .
hey , buddy .
hey .
long time , no see .
so how' s the play ?
i read a great review .
it' s going fine .
it' s going good .
she' s brilliant in it .
harry sent me roses .
so where you been , pal ?
you don' t return my calls .
i' ve been busy .
taking pictures of spider man ?
how' s the bug these days ?
the less you see of that man , the better .
now , let' s all go into the other room and have something to eat .
i' il get the hors d' oeuvres .
so how are things going at oscorp ?
they' re great .
i' m head of special projects .
we' re about to make a breakthrough on fusion .
how lovely , harry .
your father would be so proud , rest his soul .
thank you .
we' re actually funding one of your idols , pete .
otto octavius .
i' m writing a paper on him .
you want to meet him ?
you' d introduce me ?
you bet .
octavius is gonna put oscorp on the map ... ... in a way my father never even dreamed of .
m. j. , could you give me a hand ?
she' s waiting for you , pal .
what do you mean ?
the way she looks at you or doesn' t look at you .
however you want to look at it .
i don' t have time for girls right now .
why , are you dead ?
i' ve been kind of busy .
taking pictures of your friend ?
could we get off that subject ?
i want us to be friends , harry .
i want us to trust each other .
then be honest with me .
if you knew who he was , would you tell me ?
may .
oh , what , ben ?
wait .
aunt may .
oh , my .
oh , peter .
oh , for a second there , i thought i was years ago .
everybody' s gone , aren' t they ?
did they have a good time ?
i' m sure they did .
you okay ?
of course .
but you go home .
and be careful .
i don' t like that scooter thing you drive around .
i' m worried about you .
you' re so alone .
and i saw the letter from the bank .
oh , my .
you did ?
oh , well .
so ?
i' m a little behind .
everybody is .
anyway , i don' t want to talk about it anymore .
i' m tired , and you better start back home .
here , kiddo .
happy birthday .
you need it more than i do .
no , i can' t take that from you .
yes , you can !
you can take this money from me .
for god' s sake , it' s not much .
now , take it !
and don' t you dare leave it here .
oh , i' m sorry .
it' s just that i miss your uncle ben so much .
can you believe that it' s two years next month since he was taken ?
i think to myself at times ... ... were i to face the one responsible for what happened , i' d ....
oh , i don' t know what i' d do .
now ... ... you better take the rest of your cake home .
hey .
hey .
you' re still here .
i saw your billboard on bleecker .
isn' t it funny ?
i' m really kind of embarrassed .
don' t be .
it' s nice .
i get to see you every day now .
i liked seeing you tonight , peter .
oh , boy , yeah .
oh , boy , yeah " what ?
nothing .
do you want to say something ?
i ...
... was ... ... wondering if you' re still in the village .
you' re such a mystery .
peter .
what ?
happy birthday .
i' m seeing somebody now .
you mean , like a boyfriend ?
well , like i like him .
what ?
nothing .
that' s good , you know ?
companionship ....
may be more than that .
more ?
i don' t know .
i' m coming to see your play tomorrow night .
you' re coming ?
i' il be there .
don' t disappoint me .
i won' t .
rent .
hi .
hi .
what' s " hi " ?
can i spend it ?
i have a paycheck due this week and
you' re a month late again .
again .
i promise as soon as
if promises were crackers , my daughter would be fat .
i' m really sorry , mr. ditkovitch .
all i got is this 20 for the rest of the week .
sorry " doesn' t pay the rent .
and don' t try to sneak past me .
i have ears like a cat and eyes like a rodent .
thanks , mr. ditkovitch .
hi , pete .
hello ?
rent ?
doctor ?
mr. osborn' s here .
nobel prize , otto .
nobel prize .
and we' il all be rich .
it' s not about the prizes , harry .
but you need money .
you need oscorp .
who do we have here ?
this is my good friend i called you about .
he got me through high school science .
peter parker , sir .
i' m writing a paper on you for
i know what you' re doing here ... ... but i don' t have time to talk to students now .
but oscorp pays the bills , so ....
that' s why i have to take off .
board meeting .
but my job is done here .
got you two geniuses together .
good luck tomorrow , otto .
nobel prize .
we' il see you in sweden !
interesting fellow , your friend .
i won' t take much of your time .
now i remember you .
you' re connors ' student .
he tells me you' re brilliant .
he also tells me you' re lazy .
i' m trying to do better .
being brilliant' s not enough , young man .
you have to work hard .
intelligence is not a privilege , it' s a gift .
and you use it for the good of mankind .
you want to try it back there ?
so is that it ?
yes .
my design to initiate and sustain fusion .
i understand you use harmonics of atomic frequencies .
sympathetic frequencies .
harmonic reinforcement ?
go on .
an exponential increase in energy output .
a huge amount of energy .
like a perpetual sun providing renewable power for the whole world .
are you sure you could stabilize the fusion reaction ?
peter , what have we been talking about for the last hour and a half ?
this is my life' s work .
i certainly know the consequences of the slightest miscalculation .
i' m sorry .
i didn' t mean to question you .
rosie , our new friend thinks i' m gonna blow up the city .
you can sleep soundly tonight .
otto' s done his homework .
come to the demonstration tomorrow , and you' il see for yourself .
and you need to sleep soundly tonight , otto .
did edison sleep before he turned on the light ?
did marconi sleep before he turned on the radio ?
did beethoven sleep before he wrote the 5th ?
did bernoulli sleep before he found the curves of quickest descent ?
rosie , i love this boy .
peter , tell us about yourself .
do you have a girlfriend ?
well ....
i don' t really know .
well , shouldn' t you know ?
i mean , who would know ?
leave him alone .
maybe it' s a secret love .
love should never be a secret .
if you keep something as complicated as love stored up inside ... ... gonna make you sick .
i finally got lucky in love .
we both did .
but it' s hardly perfect .
you have to work at it .
i met him on the college steps , and i knew it wasn' t going to be easy .
he was studying science , and i was studying english literature .
that' s right .
i was trying to explain the theory of relativity .
and rosie was trying to explain t. s. eliot .
i still don' t understand what he was talking about .
yes , you do .
i' m serious .
t. s. eliot is more complicated than advanced science .
but if you want to get a woman to fall in love with you , feed her poetry .
poetry .
never fails .
a tall and slender maiden all alone upon a prairie
brightest green were all her garments
and her hair was like the sunshine
day by day he gazed upon her
rent !
where is my money ? !
you seem jittery tonight .
you never know who' s coming .
ladies , five minutes .
five minutes .
how' d you do that ?
work out , plenty of rest .
you know , eat your green vegetables .
that' s what my mom is always saying .
i just never actually believed her .
come on .
go .
keep it steady .
it' s a web .
go , spidey , go !
we got trouble !
get me down !
i am more than content with what mr. moncrieff said .
his voice alone inspires one with absolute credulity .
then you think we should forgive them ?
yes .
i mean , no .
hey .
hey .
hey , chief .
you park there , i' m towing it .
whatever .
shoelace .
you might want to ....
can i help you ?
yeah , i' ve come to see the show .
oh , i' m sorry , sir .
no one will be seated after the doors are closed .
it helps maintain the illusion .
miss watson , she' s a friend of mine .
she asked me to come .
but not to come late .
i have to see this show .
just let me in , i' il stand in the
a spider man a spider man
a does whatever a spider can
a spins a web , any size
catches thieves a just like flies
look out here comes the spider man
you sure you don' t wanna come tonight ?
yeah , i' m sure .
okay .
call me .
i will .
you were great tonight .
thanks .
may i have an autograph , please , miss ?
what are you doing here ?
you hungry ?
starved .
what was that ?
okay .
cool spidey outfit .
thanks .
where' d you get it ?
i made it .
looks uncomfortable .
yeah , it gets kind of itchy .
and it rides up in the crotch a little bit too .
hi .
it' s me .
sing your song at the beep .
hi , m. j.
this is peter .
i was on my way to your show and ....
well , i was on my bike ....
are you there ?
i really was planning on it all day .
and ... ...
i know you predicted i' d disappoint you .
bingo .
it' s amazing , isn' t it ?
how complicated a simple thing ... ... like being someplace at 8 : 00 can become .
actually , there was this obnoxious usher .
somebody has to talk to that usher , m. j.
your time has expired .
please deposit 50 cents for the next five minutes .
i wanna tell you the truth .
here it is .
i' m spider man .
weird , huh ?
now you know why i can' t be with you .
if my enemies found out about you ... ... if you got hurt , i could never forgive myself .
i wish i could tell you how i feel about you .
ladies and gentlemen ... ... my wife rosie and i would like to welcome you this afternoon .
but first , before we start ... ... has anybody lost a large roll of 20 dollar bills in a rubber band ?
because we found the rubber band .
it' s a terrible joke .
but thank you for coming .
today ... ... you will witness the birth of a new fusion based energy source .
safe , renewable energy and cheap electricity for everyone .
and now let me introduce my assistants .
these four actuators were developed and programmed ... ... for the sole purpose of creating successful fusion .
they are impervious to heat and magnetism .
these smart arms are controlled by my brain through a neural link .
nanowires feed directly into my cerebellum ... ... allowing me to use these arms to control fusion reaction ... ... in an environment no human hand could enter .
doctor , if the artificial intelligence in the arms ... ... is as advanced as you suggest ... ... couldn' t that make you vulnerable to them ?
how right you are .
which is why i developed this inhibitor chip ... ... to protect my higher brain function .
it means i maintain control of these arms , instead of them controlling me .
and now on to the main event .
give me the blue light , rosie .
precious tritium is the fuel that makes this project go .
there' s only 25 pounds of it on the whole planet .
i' d like to thank harry osborn and oscorp industries for providing it .
happy to pay the bills , otto .
ladies and gentlemen ... ... fasten your seat belts .
doctor , we have a successful fusion reaction .
this is a breakthrough beyond your father' s dreams .
thank you .
we' re producing a thousand megawatt surplus .
the power of the sun ... ... in the palm of my hand .
keep calm !
it' s only a spike !
it' il soon stabilize !
ladies and gentlemen , please clear the room .
we have a containment breach !
otto , please get back !
shut it off , otto !
shut it off !
it will stabilize !
it' s under control !
i' m in charge here !
it' s my money !
i' m in con
this doesn' t change anything .
what are you doing ?
pulling the plug .
no !
rosie !
watch it .
that was too close .
if he had more than a drop of tritium , he could have destroyed the city .
i' m ruined .
i have nothing left , except spider man .
he saved your life , sir .
he humiliated me by touching me .
the press will be here soon .
i suggest we move on .
what was he doing here anyway ?
molten metal penetrated the spinal cavity ... ... and fused the vertebrae at multiple points ... ... including the lamina and the roof of the spinal column .
we won' t know the extent of the damage until we get in there .
i suggest we cut off these mechanical arms , slice up the harness ... ... and , if need be , consider a laminectomy ... ... with posterior spinal fusion from c7 t1 to t1 2 .
we' re ready , doctor .
anybody here take shop class ?
help me !
help me !
no !
it' s all over town , robbie .
gossip .
rumors .
panic in the streets , if we' re lucky .
crazy scientist turns himself into some kind of a monster .
four mechanical arms welded right onto his body .
guy named otto octavius winds up with eight limbs .
what are the odds ?
hoffman !
what are we gonna call this guy ?
" dr. octopus .
that' s crap .
" science squid " ?
crap !
" dr. strange .
that' s pretty good .
but it' s taken .
wait , wait !
i got it .
dr. octopus .
i like it .
of course you do .
dr. octopus .
new villain in town .
doc ock .
genius .
what , are you looking for a raise ?
get out .
chief , i found parker .
where you been ?
why don' t you pay your phone bill .
mad scientist goes berserk , we don' t have pictures !
i heard spider man was there .
where were you ?
photographing squirrels ?
you' re fired .
chief , the planetarium party .
you' re un fired .
i need you , come here .
what do you know about high society ?
oh .
well , i  don' t answer that .
my society photographer got hit in the head by a polo ball .
you' re all i got .
big party for an american hero .
my son , the astronaut .
could you pay me in advance ?
you serious ?
pay you for what ?
standing there ?
the planetarium , tomorrow night , 8 : 00 .
there' s the door .
my rosie' s dead .
my dream is dead .
and these ... ... monstrous things should be at the bottom of the river ... ... along with me .
something ... ... in my head .
something talking .
the inhibitor chip !
gone .
rebuild .
no .
peter was right .
i miscalculated .
i couldn' t have miscalculated .
it was working , wasn' t it ?
yes .
we could rebuild .
enlarge the containment field .
make it bigger and stronger than ever .
but we need money .
steal it ?
no , no , no , i' m not a criminal .
that' s right .
the real crime would be not to finish what we started .
we' il do it here .
the power of the sun in the palm of my hand .
nothing will stand in our way .
nothing !
that' s the social security .
yes , i see .
my uncle ben' s life insurance .
yes , but i' m afraid ... ... it' s just not sufficient to refinance your home .
oh , but i' m giving piano lessons again .
you are ?
we appreciate that you' ve just opened up ... ... a new supersaver account with us today .
but the fact is ... ... you do not have the assets to justify this loan .
i' m sorry .
well ....
at least we get the toaster .
actually , that' s only with a deposit of 300 or more .
oh , yes , i see .
okay .
don' t worry , we' il figure it out .
peter ?
don' t leave me .
oh , that boy of yours is a real hero .
hold it !
put your arms up !
all of them !
here' s your change !
oh , no .
come on !
you' re getting on my nerves .
i have a knack for that .
not anymore .
freeze !
don' t move !
freeze !
hold your fire !
don' t follow me .
wait a second .
hand her over .
of course .
easy , now .
butterfingers .
look out !
help me !
help me !
i' m coming !
hang on !
help !
thank you .
aunt may .
you' ve stuck your webs in my business for the last time .
now you' il have this woman' s death on your conscience .
come on .
shame on you .
there you go .
thank you .
oh , have i been wrong about you .
we sure showed him .
what do you mean , " we " ?
take me with you , spider man .
take me .
may i ?
sure .
go ahead .
penny !
over here !
leave it .
hey .
might wanna take it easy , buddy .
why ?
it' s a party .
wouldn' t you be drinking if you lost a bundle on some crackpot ... ... who you thought was gonna take you with him to fame and fortune ?
not to mention your friend the bug .
not tonight , harry .
every night !
until i find him , it' s 24 7 .
parker !
parker !
parker !
what , are you deaf ?
i called you twice .
think i' m paying you to sip champagne ?
get a shot of my wife with the minister .
beautiful tie .
get a shot of us with the da .
beautiful dress .
here , get a shot of the mayor and his girlfriend .
wife .
ladies and gentlemen , good evening .
the committee for the science library of new york ... ... is pleased to present our guest of honor .
he' s the first man to play football on the moon .
the handsome , the heroic , the delicious ... ...
captain john jameson .
hi .
you .
listen , i' m sorry .
but there was a disturbance .
i don' t know you .
and i can' t keep thinking about you .
it' s too painful .
i' ve been reading poetry lately .
whatever that means .
day by day he gazed upon her
day by day he sighed with passion day by day
don' t start .
can i get you a drink ?
i' m with john .
he' il get me my drink .
john .
by the way , john has seen my show five times .
harry has seen it twice .
aunt may has seen it .
my sick mother got out of bed to see it .
even my father .
he came backstage to borrow cash .
but my best friend , who cares so much about me ... ... can' t make an 8 : 00 curtain .
after all these years ... ... he' s nothing to me but an empty seat .
it pisses me off , your loyalty to spider man and not to your best friend .
i find him with my father' s body , and you defend him .
take it easy .
don' t push me .
don' t act like you' re my friend .
you stole m. j. from me .
you stole my father' s love .
then you let him die because you didn' t turn in the freak .
isn' t that right ?
huh ?
isn' t that right ?
huh , brother ?
ladies and gentlemen , i just want you all to know ... ... that the beautiful miss mary jane watson has just agreed to marry me .
what a surprise .
parker , wake up !
wake up !
shoot the picture !
oh , no .
no !
why is this happening to me ?
you seem very okay to me .
my diagnosis ?
it' s up here .
you say you can' t sleep .
heartbreak ?
bad dreams ?
there is one dream where ... ... in my dream ... ...
i' m spider man .
but i' m losing my powers .
i' m climbing a wall , but i keep falling .
so you' re spider man .
in my dream .
actually , it' s not even my dream .
it' s a friend of mine' s dream .
somebody else' s dream .
what about this friend ?
why does he climb these walls ?
what does he think of himself ?
that' s the problem .
he doesn' t know what to think .
gotta make you mad not to know who you are .
your soul disappears .
nothing as bad as uncertainty .
listen ... ... maybe you' re not supposed to be spider man climbing those walls .
that' s why you keep falling .
you always have a choice , peter .
i have a choice .
all the things you' ve been thinking about , peter ... ... make me sad .
can' t you understand ?
i' m in love with mary jane .
peter , all the times we' ve talked of honesty ... ... fairness , justice ....
out of those times , i counted on you to have the courage ... ... to take those dreams out into the world .
i can' t live your dreams anymore .
i want a life of my own .
you' ve been given a gift , peter .
with great power comes great responsibility .
take my hand , son .
no , uncle ben .
i' m just peter parker .
i' m spider man ... ... no more .
no more .
no more .
you punk !
sorry .
thanks .
you' re welcome .
hurry up !
and when the borderline is tau equals zero , the eigenvalues are ... ?
someone , please ?
. 23 electron volts .
excellent work today , parker .
keep it up .
i' m not really wicked at all .
you mustn' t think that i' m wicked .
i' m not really wicked at all .
you mustn' t think that i' m wicked .
if you are not , then you have certainly been deceiving us all ... ... in a very inexcusable manner .
i hope you have not been leading a double life ... ... pretending to be wicked and being really good all the time .
that would be hypocrisy .
of course , i have been rather reckless .
i am glad .
i am glad .
i am glad .
are you glad to hear it ?
i am glad ... ... to hear it .
in fact , now you mention the subject ... ...
i have been very bad in my own small way .
you were so wonderful .
that was such a great play .
you could' ve told me you were coming .
i was afraid you' d say , " don' t come .
you look different .
i shined my shoes , pressed my pants , did my homework .
i do my homework now .
you wanna get some chow mein ?
peter ... ...
i' m getting married .
