where' s everyone going ?
probably to a fair .
or on a pilgrimage .
we' ve been gone a while , majesty , so it' s hard to tell .
a while ?? !
seven years in battle ... and all for nothing .
where are you going ?
straight on out of here .
wasn' t that king dobromil the good ?
him ?
just some vagrant knight .
but if it was , to the devil with him !
music
and we' re home .
the devll knows why
what the devil ? dobromil !
director of photography
he' s returned !
the king has returned !
executive producer
produced by
directed by
the king' s here !
what' il we do ?
nothing ...
oh , the devil !
welcome , your majesty !
what' s going on ?
everything' s running like clockwork .
seems like everything' s running away that has legs .
we missed you , you old crab .
i bet you did .
and where' s annie to greet me ?
where is my daughter ?
gadding about , majesty .
she hops on her horse and whoosh !
she hops on her horse and what ?
and whoosh !
you let that child go off on her own ?
what child , majesty ?
she' s ready for marriage .
hear that ?
my daughter' s grown up .
at least something went right .
apollonia , are things really as bad as all that ?
this kingdom was never in such a fix before .
can' t we do anything about it ?
leave , like everyone else .
are you serious ?
don' t worry , i' m staying .
and besides i had a vision ...
something came to me in a dream .
again ?
i fried up these unusual mushrooms with onions , and after i ate them i felt dizzy .
i fell down , like this , among the flowers ...
ow !
and slept sound as a log .
well , what did you dream ?
our land ... saved by a young man .
i don' t know why , but he' il be very ticklish .
and he' il call you daisy .
me ?
why me ?
how should i know ?
what does he look like ?
i didn' t see his face but he' s a good soul .
he' s brave , honest , honorable ... and an ass .
i might have guessed .
no , he' s not an ass .
i saw an ass .
our rescuer will ride a donkey .
maybe .
or maybe not .
maybe you just ate some crazy mushrooms .
that brute is killing that horse .
a foul land breeds foul people .
what can you do ?
i' m going over there .
hey , wait !
stay here .
oh , alright ...
i' il make a good man of him .
get lost , you loser !
that' s all we need , dammit !
just sitting there like a dolt ?
help me !
stop this insanity !
it' s your fault .
you drove that horse like a madman .
the sooner we' re gone the better .
what now , you freeloaders !
you' re the devil' s own !
the chickens !
the chickens !
so catch them , you good for nothings !
to hell with ... !
pull !
pull !
pull !
what are you gawking at ?
look at yourselves , you pigs !
why are you screaming ?
we caught the hens like you said .
butt out !
or would you like a whipping too ?
i' il teach you to get so dirty !
don' t you feel stupid ?
venting your rage at women and children ?
well , look here ...
it' s the good fairy .
i' m no fairy , you dolt .
get lost !
or you' il get a taste too .
run , kids !
there you are , you beasts .
get over here , you brats !
i' il teach you to hide from me !
no , daddy !
i' il catch the chickens .
i' m going to ring your necks anyway !
i' il teach you to obey me !
let me go !
hey !
what ?
you dropped your hat ...
what a monster i am .
run and play .
my darlings !
give me a hug .
we live in the grip of an inexorable law which dictates that money circulates , gyrates , rotates , and circulates again .
just like the blue blood in your majesty' s veins .
and then suddenly ...
wham bam , the current clogs .
put a sock in it , you !
i reacted like a statesman .
i let half the staff go .
all the best people .
shut up !
they cost the most .
then i dismissed the troops .
impossible !
my loyal men ?
but we' re at peace , majesty .
i fired everyone .
why should we cook so much ?
he wants us to starve .
shut your trap !
waste not , want not , majesty .
so how much have we saved ?
how ... how ... how much ?
how much ? from out of nowhere this melody popped in my head .
a tiny idea for a new anthem .
listen ...
our king dobromil ...
stop gawking !
dobromil # 8 , umpah tralala , wakes up feeling great !
umpah tralala ...
to the treasury , you tralala !
this is our treasury ?
yes , it is .
let' s have a look ...
corn !
where are the ducats ?
ducats ?
i gave the last one to a gypsy fortuneteller .
and when she looked at my palm she cried out , " the devil' s eye !
isn' t that exciting ?
what were you doing the whole time ?
we were expecting ... the spoils of your wars .
oh , shut up !
what do you propose ?
we' ve got one hope .
you need ducats !
and it takes ducats to make ducats .
the question is how to get them ?
only by striking some advantageous bargain .
the only business around here is with hell .
everyone else is broke .
i' m afraid , majesty , that this time i agree with the jester .
you mean to say you think i should do business with hell ?
what other option do we have ?
what business do you have in mind ?
we could sell ... hell ... souls , your majesty .
souls ?
whose souls were you imagining ?
whose ?
majesty , i ...
i' m prepared to sacrifice myself .
you know very well no one wants your soul .
can you tell me why your wife' s feeding geese here ?
she' s got this bizarre idea she' il make swans of them .
she herself is really a silly goose .
she' s mad as a hatter .
majesty , things are looking up .
i' ve assigned tax collecting units .
shut up already !
aaagh !
oh , man , you' il see !
what if we found annie a rich husband ?
the poor can' t and the rich won' t .
and woe is us !
help !
help !
i' m drowning !
grab hold and quit screaming .
strange , eh ?
i save you and almost bite it .
what are you looking at ?
i wanted to help you .
you looked like a corpse .
where are we exactly ?
in the land of king dobromil .
so you think that' s funny , eh ?
no one' s laughing .
no ?
too bad !
business goes better with a smile .
well , mr. joker , tell me how much wood you brought .
four cords .
four ? that is a good joke !
what do you expect for that ?
to wipe the slate clean .
and what deeds have you done ?
i burned the neighbors ' barn .
so what ?
that' s just fine .
but i feel sorry about it .
what ?? !
sorry ?? !
i' m confiscating your wood .
get lost !
next !
ten cords of hard oak .
that' s better .
and what do you want for it ?
my mother in law in hell .
kindly allow us to decide who we accommodate .
all you get is ... goat turds !
i won' t let you cheat me !
oh , yes , you will .
you took a business risk ...
want your house burned down ?
who' s got anything else to sell ?
i have some black pine .
and where' s it from ?
king lumr' s land .
well , well ...
so there' s something still growing there ?
i see you' re working hard here , too .
we' re doing our best .
so where' s the wood ?
that raft there .
two measly cords .
you get ... a jackal' s paw .
that' s worth a fortune in hell .
thanks .
it' s just what i wanted .
i' ve got something else for you .
what' s that ?
a toothpick of black pine .
a toothpick ?
what' s it good for ?
for picking out food stuck in your teeth .
yesterday we roasted a ram and i got something ...
i can' t get it out .
the devil take it !
how much ?
30 ducats : too rich for your blood .
are you joking ?
azarakh has whatever he wants .
the little bugger' s out !
what do i do with it now ?
nothing .
you can pitch it .
well , that wasn' t such a good deal .
you' re a pretty good con man .
maybe you' d like to work for us .
gladly .
get up !
i said get up !
do you hear me ?
you mangy ass !
i' m gonna break your stinking legs !
get up !
move or i' il ...
this is driving me crazy .
okay ...
okay ...
i' il skin you alive .
and the devils will make drums of your hide .
you' il drum in hell ...
i brought you some helpers .
got any work for them ?
yeah , plenty ; , but so what ?
i' ve got nothing to eat .
i' il pay you twice as much .
i' d rather cut off my tongue !
alright .
okay ...
just stop it .
well , i guess there' s nothing .
maybe next time .
i was thinking more of something in hell .
don' t be so eager , my boy .
all in good time .
all in good time .
everyone' s time will come .
where' s he going ?
that leads nowhere .
why' d you refuse the extra pay ?
pay ?
he' d only give me lucifer' s stinky old boots .
licking one clean was plenty !
why do you do it then ?
i' ve gotta do something .
and at least i' ve got security .
i hunt some , feed the family ...
what' s with the knife ?
i' m gonna skin this beast .
he refuses to work .
let him live .
i' il buy him .
ducats !
ducats !
i' m rich !
i don' t think so .
you' re the same bootlicker you were before .
come on , donkey , you' re coming with us .
man , we were rolling in clover !
let' s just go .
i had a house and fireplace , but now i' ve only ashes ,
when it' s gone it' s simply gone , all we have soon passes .
i had a cart of sturdy oak , my oxen left me too ,
when it' s gone it' s simply gone , no sense feeling blue .
okay , here you are .
sausage ...
headcheese ...
good lord !
save yourself if you can .
i had honey , i had bread , now i' ve not a crumb ,
when it' s gone it' s simply gone , whatever comes will come .
i had a warm and cozy coat , now i' ve not a flea ,
off they go , now they' re gone , and i' m feeling free .
what' s here is here , what' s not is not ,
water flows on its way and rocks are all we' ve got .
halt !
the king' s proclaimed a new tax !
three ducats per adult and one per child .
let' s get on with it !
you heard him .
pay up !
pay up !
i won' t !
oh yes , you will !
beat him !
what ?
that' s what .
beat him !
take that !
you won' t pay , eh ?
apollonia , thanks for the herbs ; here' s your oil and cloth .
okay , you fiddling hack ...
two adult and two kids .
8 ducats .
i' m happy to pay .
but why only four ?
what about my pup ?
doesn' t he have a soul ?
he' s one of god' s creatures .
sure is .
i' il pay for him too .
great .
are you mad ? all our money ?
all of it ? no way !
we' ve still got our nest egg .
come on out , ducats !
i bet it was stuffy in there .
ten ducats ...
a few extra so the king can live it up a bit .
i' il see that he gets them .
that fine man deserves them .
deserves them ? !
are you nuts ?
we sold everything .
are you trying to make beggars of us ?
i know who' s behind this !
i' il get you , you witch !
me ?
make fools of honest people !
what did you do to him , you witch ? !
no !
you witch !
you put weeds under his hat .
what' s going on , crazy woman ?
put me down !
you know i will , you wretch .
good day , madam daisy .
wait ...
are you talking to me , an old woman ?
you' re the prettiest garden i' ve ever met .
good gracious , my vision !
that' s him .
and he' s got an ass .
annie , he' s here !
he' s here !
he' s come !
who ?
our rescuer !
the one from my dream .
and you know what he called me ?
daisy !
wasn' t he supposed to call me that ?
well ...
prophesy is never so clear cut .
but he' s got a donkey .
i still have shoes !
my very best shoes .
didn' t we overdo it a bit ?
perhaps a bit .
certainly someone needs them more than me .
get a grip on yourself !
robbing paupers ...
aren' t you ashamed ?
don' t spoil my fun , sniveler !
so you want to have fun , eh ?
come and play !
how ... how dare you ?? !
what are you waiting for ?
seize him !
that' il teach you .
give it to him good !
let him have it !
he' s had enough .
am i in heaven ?
sorry to disappoint you , but i' m not your guardian angel .
don' t move ; , just lie still .
does something hurt ?
my heart .
i think i' m dying .
that' s a lovely handkerchief .
they kicked you in the head .
you' d better come and let annie and i treat you .
are you satisfied ?
we' re flat broke !
what' s going on ? why do you look so thunderstruck ?
hey , kids , dad' s back !
daddy !
it seems that we , king dobromil the good , are aging rather fast .
dogs age seven times faster and make not a peep of complaint .
what a flatterer you are .
why should i flatter you when you don' t pay me ?
aren' t you exaggerating ?
it' s so good to be home , sire .
don' t let him spoil it .
it was a garden here when we left .
and now ?
don' t you smell the stench ?
if you don' t like it here pack your things and go .
don' t say that a second time ...
what would i pack anyway ?
there' s not even a pot to pee in around here .
give me a ducat and i' il be off .
got one ?
here .
this king had what it takes .
it' s not a real ducat anyway .
oh well ...
have a nice time , majesty .
farewell .
if you' re annie , you' re the only thing here worth envying .
annie , is it you ?
incredible !
you really are old enough to marry .
but you deserve a spanking for gallivanting around so .
where' s the jester going ?
nowhere ...
he just came back to see his daughter .
who' d have thought ... that the people still had so much money ?
me .
but we needn' t tell the king .
get a move on !
heave !
i am .
you little ducats don' t want to , but you have to .
jump !
how much longer must we slave ?
oh , please !
i' ve got to bleed the people dry .
but relax ...
we' il be repaid a thousandfold .
next batch ...
ready ?
sure .
come on , ducats .
come on .
i' m coming .
think the king suspects us ?
stop creating devils out of nothing .
he' s harmless as a lamb .
he' s eating out of my hand .
toss them in .
the gate' s closing ; in you go !
kiss your goosey .
no , no , no !
did you say goosey ?
how about roasting one ?
oh , no !
oh , yes .
the oven' s hot and i' m a bit peckish .
get a move on !
keep working !
hold up !
good work .
the minister will be satisfied .
looking good with that crown !
what' s this ? !
what' s going on here ?
they' re rebelling .
each sinner has to drink a stein of swill .
hot swill .
drink up , boys .
what ?? !
drink it down .
swill , eh ?
it' s beer !
dark beer .
and well chilled .
so our sinners can live it up .
i' il give you " live it up , " you idiot !
to lucifer , now !
so you felt sorry for the sinners ?
yeah .
it' s hot , right ?
nothing' s better than a cold one when it' s hot , eh ? lovely !
i even have a hammock to rock them in .
and i sing them lullabies ...
that' s a great idea .
and i have something for you too .
a sweet candy ... for my sweet little dove .
get this into your thick head : goodness is treacherous .
but evil is exciting , intoxicating , even elevating .
take him away .
he' s the sixth this week .
what' s going on ?
it' s apollonia' s flowers , what else ?
no wonder they' re so messed up .
apollonia , my dear , stick you tongue in your ear .
nice rhyme , eh ?
excellent execution !
so stick it out .
my tongue ?
taste good ?
this isn' t funny anymore .
why is dobromil' s kingdom still afloat , eh ?
i don' t understand it .
i want him here !
king dobromil the good ...
we' ve got to speed things up a bit .
excellent .
goosey kissy ...
what the matter ?
don' t we like it ?
greetings , friend .
enchant , madam .
why are you here , boss ?
sit , scoundrel .
why insult him , sir ?
that' s no insult , madam .
that' s his title .
i was in the neighborhood and thought i' d drop in on a friend to find out how the case stands .
when can i bring the contract ?
the contract ?
concerning the contract ...
the king' s still not ready .
he' s got to stew in his own poverty a bit longer .
it' s dragging on too long .
i' m doing what i can .
the king hinders my every move .
guess what he thought up now ?
he wants to marry annie off .
that' s not good .
that' s bad .
a rich husband might screw up our plans .
i should punish you .
me ?
what about the gold i' ve sent down to you ?
watch ...
a ducat .
i put it in the pitcher ...
take it out .
i ...
i can' t .
you can .
this is some of your magic .
no magic .
drop the coin and your hand is free .
you see ? you' ve got to make a sacrifice to save your skin .
don' t worry about any suitors .
i' il think of something .
hey , look who' s come for a visit !
i thought that beating made me hallucinate .
it' s you who' s apollonia' s hallucination .
you' ve made yourselves at home .
maybe i was waiting for you .
such a great match , philip and his wench ...
whoa , you beast !
see , you shouldn' t bully that animal ; it' s sacred .
what are you two doing ?
must i do everything myself ?
guido , go chop some wood .
show me you' re good for something .
you live somewhere nearby ?
on a farm ?
at the castle .
at the castle ?
so you serve at the castle .
it seems like i serve here at apollonia' s .
has anyone ever told you you were pretty ?
no ...
actually , yes .
the king' s jester .
annie , you' re pretty ... ugly .
you' re a real apothecary .
it comes in handy sometimes .
careful , that' s nightshade .
it' s poisonous .
you used this to make that man crazy ?
i wanted to make him good , and i made him an idiot .
here' s cherry tarts and berry juice .
let me take that .
i like it here , but i need good work ...
work that' s well paid .
it won' t be easy to find work .
what are you good at ?
i know a lot about ... just about everything .
we need someone like that .
and you ?
me ?
i can fight a bit , but not much else .
fighting isn' t bad , and you' ve got the donkey too .
i' d accept a position at the castle .
but i won' t be a servant .
of course .
maybe the king himself will find you something .
annie will put in a good word .
i don' t need any wench' s help .
i' ve got to go .
wait ; will we meet again ?
that' s up to you .
you know where to find me .
don' t worry ; we' il visit .
what' s that ?
devils come for my flowers .
we paid 30 ducats for that ass .
for the rest i' il remember you in my prayers .
philip !
if you stick these herbs under someone' s hat they become stupid but good .
they might come in handy .
come on !
before someone gets our jobs .
thanks for everything , apollonia .
and we' re alone again .
let' s go get some water .
come , mira , let' s water the garden .
what are you whining about ?
what ?
what' s going on ?
scoundrels !
enough of your shenanigans ; i need water !
damnation , apollonia , don' t make me angry .
not enough for your stinking herbs ? just say what you want .
want pearls ? you' ve got them .
pitch them to your swine !
i don' t have that many .
beat it , you bat .
impressive , eh ? i can even do a triple flip with a half twist .
stop bugging me .
i' m watering .
insufferable flowers .
i' d scorch them with brimstone .
cut the swagger , mr. wheeler dealer .
i' m pure as a lily and you' re powerless here .
look who' s swaggering now .
even you' il end up as my guest .
beat it !
hey , look ...
we need a cook , but not just anyone .
show me what you can do .
i' m supposed to concoct a meal from slops ?
cut the jokes , friend .
you' re cooking for the king .
this is for the king ?
it' s fit for pigs .
the minister will haze you if it doesn' t pass muster .
i' m not joking .
you wanted to speak to the king ?
come on then .
don' t worry , we' il manage .
we' il add ... a lot of garlic .
it' il turn out , you' il see .
let' s light the oven .
well ...
what are you good for ?
majesty , maybe i could be your advisor .
and what could you advise me about ?
to be honest ...
i' m good at everything ... as far as i know .
okay , then ...
tell me what you' d do if people were fleeing the realm .
fleeing ?
i' d flee too ...
on a horse ...
to catch up with them ... and bring them to their senses .
my kingdom for a horse !
your majesty , this is philip .
he' s applying as head cook .
oh , is he really ?
let' s give it a try .
don' t risk it , majesty ; it was made from our own stores .
this one is a dangerous criminal bent on poisoning you .
it smells wonderful !
garlicky .
it' s excellent !
i name you head cook .
what about me , majesty ?
you ?
a good question ...
i think you' il fit in perfectly here .
you' re my new jester .
put it on .
you come with me .
it suits him , eh , daughter ?
that' s your daughter ?
last i heard .
are you a devil ?
who ?
you .
me ?
no !
no ?
too bad .
you have that hellish fire in your eyes .
i can feel it .
well , boys , one of you will return among the living to sue for the princess ' hand .
you know princess annie ?
little goat tootsy .
aha , my nephew urugal ...
you' d like to marry annie , eh ?
little goat tootsy .
but he ... he ... he wasn' t selected .
no ?
such a handsome buck ?
as you wish ...
annie' s going to marry one of you .
and that' s how we' il knock the king for a loop .
who' il volunteer ?
what about you , urugal ?
not interested ?
i am .
but i don' t get it ...
do i go after annie ?
or do i start by knocking the king for a loop ?
you understand perfectly .
sure i do .
marry annie and knock the king for a loop .
i choose you , urugal .
and you ...
get lost !
you' re a deep thinker .
true .
how will you get her ?
i' il give her this to suck on .
then annie' s footsies will follow me like ...
iittle goat tootsies .
excellent .
that' s right .
my father' s looking for a husband for me .
i thought you already had one .
cut it out .
let' s leave here .
you want to run away with me ?
you know nothing about me .
i know everything .
really ?
who am i then ?
you' re my dream .
and apollonia conjured you up .
she ate some mushrooms and you appeared to her .
the donkey , too , right ?
exactly .
can i tickle you ?
sure .
feel anything ?
nothing .
wait ...
i feel it ...
it' s really nice .
oh , you !
it doesn' t tickle ?
you' re supposed to laugh .
i feel more like crying .
you' il soon be married ...
so let' s run away .
that won' t help .
you don' t want to go with me .
you don' t really want me .
you' re like these flowers .
so beautiful ... it hurts my eyes .
then we must protect them .
prince , you' re like manna from heaven !
i know .
lucifer chose me himself .
i came for annie .
here i am !
catch me , annie !
run , run !
come on !
philip ?
i can hear you ...
are you here ?
annie !
here i am !
wait !
now it' s your turn .
no ... oh , yes it is .
follow me !
watch the steps !
that' s cheating .
sometimes cheating is best .
oh , really ?
hey , you' il pay for that !
i' d rather be enjoying a warm bath .
present arms !
prince laguru of the east !
let' s stoke this fire a bit, eh ?
prince , the king' s there .
i' il present this to him .
hi there .
a gift from the prince .
thank you .
coal ?
it' s not coal .
it' s lava .
what do i do with it ?
i use it to scrub my heels .
this is your gift ?
you' ve got nothing else ?
diamonds ...
hey , bring that here .
got any more ?
coming out our ears .
prince laguru ...
what brings you here ?
it' s like this ...
i ... uh ... want the princess ... uh ... as my wife ...
and i' m gonna knock your majesty for a loop .
majesty ... the prince is from a land near mongolia .
it' s their custom that ... that ... that the groom must fight the father for his bride .
as they say , he has to knock him for a loop .
if we must fight ...
i' m sure it isn' t necessary .
i don' t care , but where' s the ... pr ... pr ... princess ?
hi there !
your majesty , apparently she' s dressing .
she wants to look her best .
what do you want ?
annie' s fooling around with the cook in the bath .
annie was seen in your steam bath with the cook .
what ?? !
just look at us .
hold on ...
wring it out .
anne !
what are you doing ? !
is that annie footsy goaty tootsy ?
that drowned rat ?
that' s how you greet your future husband ?
must she greet this lagoon , or whatever his name is ?
majesty , he' s a prince .
prince or no , take these and get out !
what am i , like , supposed to do now ?
start looking elsewhere .
i don' t ever want to see you with that cook again .
that' s youth , eh ?
you' il catch cold , princess .
hey , i had this for annie .
what do i do with it now ?
for annie , eh ? give it here .
that' s not for you !
get over here .
give me a kiss .
i don' t want a kiss and i don' t want you !
of course you do .
get back here !
can i come in ?
you can do whatever you want .
or so it seems .
watch your mouth !
you know i want what' s best for you .
so you locked me up ?
it' s for your own good .
i' m ashamed of you .
to let your realm be plundered like this .
no one respects you anymore .
but i wasn' t even here .
exactly .
can hear us , king ?
we' re packing up ; and if you' re wise you' il do the same .
someone' s ruining this place .
beat it !
get lost , scum !
you say no one respects me anymore .
maybe someone still does .
we are , after all , of royal blood .
i think it' s time i met a certain someone ...
son of a gun !
what a waste .
what have you got there ?
nothing , majesty .
why are you lying ?
the devil knows why .
tell lucifer to come .
it' s time i met him .
you know the spanish boot ?
a cruel instrument .
nails pierce the foot ...
blood spurts forth ...
hell fire !
this little thing is far more humane .
the so called spanish thimble .
we gently and carefully place the thumb inside ...
and voila !
it becomes an inkwell full of royal blood .
majesty , the time is now ripe .
give me your soul and i' il shower your realm ... with riches .
your signature , please .
just a moment .
we' il wait for midnight to strike .
i have a weakness for theatricality .
the clock has struck .
please be so kind , majesty , as to endorse this parchment , this document of documents , with your royal signature in blood .
life is beautiful , so enjoy it .
i' m coming for you in a year .
guido !
i' ve got to get out of here .
give this to annie .
it' s important .
and tell her i love her , and that she should wait for me .
count on me .
thanks .
lucifer , wait !
what do you want ?
to work for you .
hurry up .
you wanted a job so no goofing off .
show me what you rustled up .
what matters most is how it tastes .
the sauce is great .
what' s in it ?
i can' t even remember ...
cranberries and hot peppers .
oh ho !
sweet and hot , like the carrot and the stick !
i use that too when necessary .
okay , you' ve sold me .
for a year then ?
it needn' t be in your own blood yet .
put it there .
what happened to them ?
they sold me their souls .
lifeless bodies lost in oblivion .
and that' s the greatest punishment , eh ... for you of noble birth ?
your father , isn' t it ?
you are philip , son of king lumr , are you not ?
i know all about you .
you too will end like this one day .
i' il get you .
and what if i get you ?
think you can dupe me ?
laughable , but interesting .
i' d happily play for your soul .
if you ' get me , ' as you say , i' il return your father' s soul .
of course , if you fail during the year of your service , you' il keep me company for all eternity .
not a bad offer , eh ?
not bad .
don' t worry , we' il grow on each other .
now , down to business ...
forgive me , philip , for hurting you .
i never wanted to hurt anybody !
the times are so strange .
just tell me what to do and i' il do it .
thanks , apollonia !
it worked !
i' ve got you !
i can' t believe it worked .
yes , you' ve got me , philip .
do you take me for a fool !
i' m not got so easily , my boy .
it' s just grass .
guido exchanged it on you .
now get lost !
and no more games !
where' s the food ? !
finally .
can' t you move any slower ?
give it here .
it took forever .
what is this crap ?
where' s the cook ?
i' il shove this slop down his throat !
bring him to me .
we' ve sought him in vain .
he' s vanished into thin air .
guido , where' s philip ?
where else ?
he found a job with better pay .
that' s a lie .
don' t ask me then if you think i' m lying .
didn' t he leave me a note ?
nothing .
he just disappeared .
move .
did you send him away ?
no .
why would i ?
but maybe it' s for the best .
you' il never see me again .
what a morning , huh ?
let' s cheer things up ...
can you explain this ?
don' t recognize yourself , eh ?
you did it all for this ?
guards , seize him !
so that' s how it is .
if i' m going to hell you' re coming with me .
what are you waiting for ?
seize him !
against your own king ?
you' il pay for this .
that' s right ...
out of the realm' s coffers .
this can' t be happening !
take the old man as well .
we' re cleaning up around here .
and find the princess so everything' s in order !
guard them carefully !
don' t let them step one foot out of the castle .
you !
got anything to say about that coin ?
throw him behind bars !
come on , you clown !
what' s happening ... ?
stop !
where are you going ?
did they hurt you ?
such brutes have no feelings .
he' s just a big oaf .
leave him to me .
i' il teach him his manners .
he' s yours .
get this : if guido tells you to cut off my hand then you' il cut off my hand .
oh , man , have i got an idea !
i' il give you the royal seal .
you' d like that , eh ?
i don' t really need it .
why not ?
i' ve got a present for you too .
do you like it ?
a lot .
now go visit the king because he must be lonely .
the king ...
i' m going to see the king !
guard them well .
all of them !
philip !
philip !
excuse me , did you take anyone across last night ?
my philip ?
finally .
this is where you are .
mira , find annie .
annie !
how could you do this to me ?
i' ve had a devil of a time .
are you listening ?
what are you doing here ?
i' m scared about philip .
i' m sure something' s happened to him .
otherwise he' d have already found me .
can you believe it ?
first he says he loves me ; then he leaves without a word .
philip knows what he' s doing .
love must sometimes stand aside .
easy to say for someone who spent her whole life with herbs .
what could you know of love ?
you think i know nothing ?
listen here .
i' ve been in love .
a love that burned even in the coldest winter .
but it wasn' t meant to be , and when he left me my love was still so strong that i drowned myself in tears .
who was it ?
who ?
your father .
my father ?
but he married my mother .
sure , she was rich and noble so he married her .
just like that !
a lovely spot , eh ?
we also came here .
love in winter grows here .
come here ...
philip will return , you' il see .
finally .
what is it ?
jackal' s paw a la honey .
looks great .
get lost !
i forgot to tell you ... my dear philip , that everything here lives and dies by my hand .
so only i can destroy king dobromil' s dear little contract .
everything moves towards it' s end .
except me of course .
forgive me , father ...
why do you want to destroy us ?
that' s just like you .
always blaming someone else .
you destroy yourselves .
i just watch with my fingers crossed .
but with your traits you play right into my hands .
it won' t be long now .
hell fire !
mira !
where are you , mira ?
apollonia will have to look for us again .
come here , mira .
come on !
hey , you little rascal .
let' s pick the herbs and get home .
still sulking ?
i' d like to make you ... a proposition .
marry me .
you and i ... get married ?
have you lost your mind ?
the throne will soon be vacant .
it could be ours to share .
since when do jesters barter the royal throne ?
it' s royal no longer .
the king sold lucifer his soul .
how dare you say that !
you liar !
he' s got few days left to live .
marry me or you' il never see your father again .
everything here is mine anyway .
not me .
it' s just a matter of time .
there' s still philip .
yeah ? where ?
forget about him .
he' s lucifer' s eager servant .
you lie .
i' m flying !
we' il be angels soon .
i' m light as a feather .
but you feel like a ton .
you' re making me swing .
you' re flying too .
something fell from above .
another angel i suppose .
who are you ?
get your hands off me !
don' t worry .
we love the world .
yesterday we were rolling in apollonia' s clover .
pure bliss !
now we' re angels ... almost .
wanna try it ?
how do i find lucifer ?
lucifer ?
he can' t stand angels .
but if he' s who you want , keep heading straight on .
urugal !
help me , uncle !
ah , what delicate flower do we have here ?
she wants to speak to you , sir .
i see you' ve moved up in the world .
i' ve made the best of things .
what do you want ?
do you know anything about annie ?
you mean the princess ?
what is she to me ?
it' s as if she vanished .
i' d like to speak to the king .
why not ?
apollonia !
what are you doing here ?
i' m not here to reminisce ...
i' m looking for annie .
she was with me ... then she disappeared .
i' m afraid for her .
my annie is gone and only fear remains .
dobromil , i don' t recognize you .
it' s a mess here , just like your whole kingdom .
did you come to reproach me ?
i can do nothing more .
yes ...
so i heard .
you wanted to marry annie to a rich man .
you' d just ruin her life , like you ruined ours .
your refined combinations send me into raptures .
not for much longer : my year is almost up .
almost up ? let' s have a look ...
you signed on for ten years .
what ?
lucifer , get up here !
seems like she wants something .
i' m telling you to get up here !
another bucket of diamonds ... ?
i' il be back in a flash .
i' ve got a deal for you .
well , spill it .
i' m all ears .
cancel the contract with the king ... and i' il give you my garden .
you can do whatever you want with it .
too late .
i don' t care about your herbs anymore .
soon enough not even thistles will grow here .
come , my lovely flower .
let me go !
you wanted to see lucifer , so come on !
annie !
what are you doing here ?
i should ask you the same .
oh , come now , kids .
what a pleasant surprise !
i trust i' m not interrupting .
came to say hi ? i can' t praise philip' s services too much .
but he just did something a little stupid .
you stole something out of my pocket .
but why ?
to help king dobromil ? no !
to save his own precious cowardly skin .
it wasn' t for 10 years !
it was just a scrap of parchment .
you walked into my trap .
you see ? now i' ve got you .
golly , boss , you' re brilliant .
get her out of here .
it' s not her time yet .
where' re your shoes ?
i gave them to guido for a unicorn .
a unicorn ?
yeah .
where is it ?
it was in the sky this morning , then it vanished .
the devil take it !
he won' t drive me crazy .
i have some news of annie .
what ... ? annie ?
what is it ?
where' s your unicorn ?
you' il get no more clouds from me .
tell me about annie .
i heard she' s in danger .
danger ?
what danger ? speak !
i don' t know ...
i said i just heard about it .
find her .
i' il give you anything you want .
i already have everything .
but maybe there is something .
if i find her will you agree to our marriage ?
bring her .
i want to see her again .
majesty , the clock has struck midnight and i have come with my faithful servant .
the hour has struck ... just as i struck the coins that now fill your treasury .
don' t ruin this for me .
i like this part the best .
as i said , the hour has struck .
here is the parchment signed in your blood .
come with me , please .
just a moment , master .
before the king goes to hell
i' d like him to fulfill his promise .
he must give me his daughter' s hand in marriage .
i had no choice , annie .
i had to see you again .
all very touching , but i' ve got a document here , so let' s go .
lucifer ?
shouldn' t you read it first ?
you think so ?
well okay ...
i ...
philip the cook , will faithfully serve lucifer ...
what is the meaning of this ?
that' s that fake scrap of parchment , remember ?
my year of faithful service .
where' s the king' s ... signed in blood ?
you burned it .
destroyed it by your own hand .
get it ? the king is free .
he' s not yours anymore !
the king is free .
he' s not yours anymore !
the princess is getting married !
and not to just anyone .
but to our savior prince philip !
hey , you left without us !
don' t worry .
i' il come back for you .
strike !
lift !
strike !
lift !
no more !
enough !
will you lick those boots, guido ?
or won' t you lick those boots ?
always flitting about , eh , annie ?
to our children' s happiness ; how about it , lumr ?
and to your health , dobromil .
and to weathering that terrible storm .
i myself feel like a young man , full of energy .
he' s trying to amuse us !
it' s a barrel of laughs here .
i guess i' il gather my old knights for a noble conquest .
why not stay here and put your realm in order ?
to our savior' s happiness .
hey there , my daisy annie !
hi !
is it another vision ?
oh , that' s the end !
if you relish lard , the fat , and the rind ,
if you only snoop and never seek to find ,
if you balance accounts as you fall asleep ,
if you count money instead of sheep ,
and still expect to strum in heaven' s dell ,
you' il end up drumming hide in hell .
if it gives you pleasure to make a scene ,
if you always speak but nothing mean ,
if you' d sell your soul for a bit of gold ,
if you think you' re wise because you' re old ,
and still expect to strum in heaven' s dell ,
you' il end up drumming hide in hell .
ignore the devils skulking in the bush ,
they can' t answer , when shove comes to push ,
why the world makes you sigh ,
they just say , the devil knows why .
if you slink around from door to door ,
if you hide goat tootsies beneath the floor ,
if your mind is nothing more than farts ,
if you laugh when someone breaks his heart ,
and still expect to strum in heaven' s dell ,
you' il end up drumming hide in hell .
ignore the devils skulking in the bush ,
they can' t answer , when shove comes to push ,
why the world makes you sigh ,
they just say , the devil knows why ..
