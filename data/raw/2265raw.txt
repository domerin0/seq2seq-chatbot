lizzy !
jane !
what do you think ?
mr collins has made an offer of marriage to charlotte lucas !
she' s accepted him !
charlotte ?
engaged to mr collins ?
impossible !
the fireplace in the great room at rosings would be much larger than that .
a fireplace of truly prodigious dimensions .
but why should you be surprised , my dear lizzy ?
do you think it incredible that mr collins could procure any woman' s good opinion , because he didn' t succeed with you ?
charlotte , i didn' t mean ...
i was surprised .
charlotte , if mr collins has been so fortunate as to secure your affections ,
i' m delighted for you both .
i see what you are feeling .
i' m not romantic , you know .
i never was .
i ask only a comfortable home .
and , considering mr collins ' character and situation in life ,
i' m convinced my chance of happiness with him is as fair as most who enter the marriage state .
my dear charlotte !
cousin elizabeth , you can see before you the happiest of men !
jane , it was such a humiliating spectacle !
she knows she' s marrying one of the stupidest men in england .
i never believed her capable of that .
lizzy , you do not make allowances for differences of situation and temper .
our cousin mr collins is not the cleverest of men , perhaps , but he is respectable .
he is not vicious , and as far as fortune goes , it' s an eligible match .
very eligible !
you wouldn' t think of marrying a man like that , simply to secure your own comfort .
no , but lizzy , not everyone is the same .
dear jane !
i doubt that you will have to make a choice between marrying for love and marrying for more material considerations .
though you may , perhaps ?
this came just now from netherfield , ma' am .
thank you .
it' s from caroline bingley .
she writes ... .. that the whole party will have left netherfield by now , for london .
and without any intention of coming back again .
charles first thought that his business in london would only take a few days , but we' re certain that this cannot be so . / am convinced that when charles gets to town , he will be in no hurry to leave it again . / do not pretend to regret anything / shall leave in hertfordshire , my dearest friend , except your society .
mr darcy , of course , is impatient to see his sister .
and to confess the truth , / ' m scarcely less eager to meet her again , from the hope / dare to entertain of her being hereafter ... my sister .
am / wrong , my dearest jane , in indulging the hope of an event which would secure the happiness of so many ?
is it not clear enough ?
caroline bingley believes her brother is indifferent to me and she means to put me on my guard .
can there be any other opinion on the subject ?
yes , there can !
miss bingley sees that her brother is in love with you , and she wants him to marry miss darcy .
she hopes to keep him in town and persuade you that he does not care about you .
indeed , jane , you ought to believe me .
no one who has seen you and bingley together can doubt his affection .
i cannot believe caroline is capable of wilful deceit .
all i can hope for is that she is deceived herself .
believe her to be deceived , by all means , but she can hardly convince a man so much in love that he' s in love with someone else instead !
if bingley is not back by your side and dining at longbourn within two weeks ,
i shall be very much surprised .
i don' t envy charlotte in the slightest !
fancy marrying a clergyman !
he' il read from fordyce' s sermons every night .
before they go to bed !
look at that hideous cloth !
it would do very well for mary .
look !
there' s denny and carter .
and wickham !
i suppose you' il keep him all to yourself again ?
of course .
she' s violently in love with him !
for heaven' s sake , lower your voice .
good afternoon to you , ladies !
how fortunate !
we were going to longbourn in search of you .
we came into town in search of you !
we hoped we would see you at the netherfield ball .
i was very sorry to lose the pleasure of dancing with you .
but fate , it would seem ...
no .
with you i must be entirely open .
i decided that it would be wrong for me to be there .
i found that i had better not meet with mr darcy .
scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself .
i understand and admire your forbearance .
not that it would give me a moment' s concern to see mr darcy publicly set down , but in mr bingley' s house ...
it would grieve me to see him embarrassed and discomfited .
and through him , your sister .
yes .
i hear mr collins is engaged to be married .
yes , to my good friend charlotte lucas .
i had thought that his intentions tended in another direction .
perhaps they did , but they took a little turn , to everybody' s satisfaction .
and relief .
i hope that you will stay and take tea with us .
i should like to introduce you to my mother and father .
thank you .
denny !
oh , young george wickham is such a charming young man , is he not , my dear ?
what ?
oh , indeed he is .
it was very good of him to entertain us so eloquently with stories about his misfortunes .
with such narratives to hand , who would read novels ?
but i believe he has been treated contemptibly by mr darcy , father .
i dare say he has .
though darcy may be no more of a black hearted villain than your average rich man , used to his own way .
it behoves us all to take very careful thought before pronouncing an adverse judgement on any of our fellow men .
lord !
i feel very sorry for poor mr wickham .
and so becoming in his regimentals !
i remember the time when i liked a red coat myself well enough .
and i do still in my heart .
and there' s no need to smile like that , miss lizzy !
though mr wickham has taken a fancy to you , i' m sure you' ve done nothing to deserve it , after your dealings with mr collins !
well , it is all in vain , it will all come to nothing !
the poor young man !
if only he had five or six thousand a year ,
i' d be happy to see him marry any of the girls !
but nothing turns out the way it should .
and now mr bingley , of whom we all had such expectations , is gone off forever !
what ?
i' ve heard again from caroline bingley .
it' s now definite that they will stay in town for the whole winter .
i cannot believe it .
it is true .
come now , jane , take comfort .
next to being married , a girl likes to be crossed in love now and then .
when is it your turn , lizzy ?
you can' t be long outdone by jane , when here are officers enough in meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country .
let wickham be your man .
he' s a pleasant fellow .
he would jilt you creditably .
thank you , sir , but a less agreeable man would do .
we must not all expect jane' s good fortune .
true , but it is a comfort to think ... that whatever of that kind may befall you , you have an affectionate mother who will always make the most of it .
i don' t know what will become of us all , indeed i do not !
and i cannot bear to think of charlotte lucas being mistress of this house !
that i should be forced to make way for her , and see her take my place !
my dear , don' t give way to such gloomy thoughts .
let us hope for better things .
let us flatter ourselves that i might outlive you .
you mustn' t be anxious for me , lizzy .
he will be forgot , and we shall all be as we were before .
but , i may remember him as ... .. the most amiable man of my acquaintance .
that is all .
i have nothing either to hope or fear ... .. and nothing to reproach him with .
at least i have not had that pain .
my dear jane .
you' re too good .
your sweetness and disinterestedness are truly angelic .
don' t tease me , lizzy .
indeed i do not tease you .
there are few people whom i really love , and even fewer of whom i think well .
the more i see of the world , the more i am dissatisfied with it .
jane , what if you were to go to town ?
aunt and uncle gardiner would gladly take you with them to gracechurch street after christmas .
why would you have me go to london , lizzy ?
no reason .
a change of scene and society ?
why are you so late ?
i' m sure i feared your coach had overset itself , or you had been attacked by robbers !
nonsense , we made good time .
how do you do , fanny ?
very ill , edward .
no one knows what i suffer with my nerves .
but then i never complain .
that' s the best way , fanny .
you' re very good .
have you brought us some presents ?
i see you' ve not changed , lydia .
why , have i not grown ?
aye , in everything but good sense .
lizzy !
get yourselves in , get yourselves in , for you have barely time for a change of clothes !
we are bidden to the philips ' this evening .
i have no desire to be going here and there at night .
i should much rather sit at home and rest my poor nerves .
# god rest ye merry gentlemen , let nothing you dismay ,
# remember christ our saviour was born on christmas day ,
# to save us all from satan' s pow' r ...
aye , poor jane .
i would not have you think i blame poor jane at all !
who could blame poor jane for the matter ?
she is the dearest girl in the world !
i was telling our dear sister , mrs gardiner , she did her best .
she would have got bingley if she could .
she did her best , and no one could do more .
but , oh , sister , when i think about lizzy !
it must be very hard , sister .
it is very hard .
she could have been mr collins ' wife by now !
that would have given you such comfort !
oh , those lucases are such artful people indeed .
they are all for what they can get !
however , your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts .
and we are very pleased to hear what you tell us about the latest fashions for long sleeves .
may i present mr wickham to you , aunt ?
i understand you come from derbyshire , mr wickham .
indeed i do , ma' am .
do you know the country ?
very well .
i spent some of the happiest years of my life at lambton .
not five miles from where i grew up , at pemberley !
pemberley !
surely it is the most handsome house in derbyshire , and consequently in the world !
i see you take my view of things , ma' am .
are you acquainted with the family ?
no .
i had the good fortune to be the protg of old mr darcy .
he was the very best of men .
i wish you' d known him .
and a four on yours , and i' m out !
lord , i' ve won again !
let' s have some dancing now .
i long for a dance !
mary !
mary , play grimstock .
capital !
capital !
fine girls , are they not , mr gardiner ?
indeed they are , sir william .
the two eldest in particular , perhaps ?
indeed , indeed .
they would grace the court of st. james itself !
but let' s not forget the younger miss bennets !
aye , they have arms and legs enough between them , and are three of the silliest girls in england .
when do you go into kent ?
we shall spend the wedding night at lucas lodge , and then travel to hunsford on friday .
you will write to me , lizzy ?
i believe i am not likely to leave kent for some time .
i shall depend on hearing from you very often .
that you certainly shall .
my father and maria are to come to me in march .
lizzy , will you promise to be one of the party ?
you will be as welcome as either of them .
then how could i refuse ?
but i' il only come if you guarantee me a glimpse of the famous chimney piece at rosings park !
that you could scarcely avoid , even if you wished to !
charlotte !
have you asked her ?
is she to come to hunsford with us ?
yes .
good !
i shan' t be half so frightened of lady catherine if you are with us , lizzy !
who is that girl dancing with mr wickham ?
her name is mary king .
she' s come to stay with her uncle in meryton .
she' s not very pretty , is she ?
beauty is not the only virtue , maria .
she' s just inherited a fortune of 10, 000 pounds , i understand .
now that is a definite virtue !
it is very hard .
and i feel sorry for lizzy , because she' s done little to deserve it .
for wickham to pursue miss king all the way to barnet , just for her 10, 000 pounds !
i wish someone would die and leave me 10, 000 pounds .
then all the officers would love me !
i' m sure they would , kitty dear .
did you think her pretty , mamma ?
no indeed , she has nothing to any of you .
a little short freckled thing !
poor wickham .
how he must be suffering .
january the 12th .
my dearest lizzy , here we continue at gracechurch street to be quiet and comfortable .
aunt and uncle could not be kinder or more attentive .
all / lack here , dear lizzy , is you , to make me laugh at myself .
three weeks ago , when our aunt was going to that part of town , / took the opportunity of calling on miss bingley in grosvenor street . / was very eager to see caroline again .
and / thought she was glad to see me , though a little out of spirits .
she reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to london , and / thought it very strange that both my letters should have gone astray .
very strange indeed .
my visit was not long , as caroline and mrs hurst were going out .
goodbye , miss bennet .
they promised to call at gracechurch street in a day or two .
/ waited at home every morning for three weeks , and at length , today she came .
/ know , my dear lizzy , you will be incapable of triumphing at my expense , when / confess / have been entirely deceived in miss bingley' s regard for me .
she made it very evident that she took no pleasure in seeing me .
when / asked after her brother , she made it clear that he knows of my being in town , but is much engaged at present with mr darcy and his sister .
/ must conclude then , that mr bingley now no longer cares for me .
lizzy !
come quick !
denny and carter are here .
and guess who else ?
wickham !
i heard you were going into kent .
i felt i could not let you go without calling to see you once .
i' m very glad you did .
i' ve missed our conversations .
i hear i am to congratulate you on your forthcoming betrothal to miss king ?
you must despise me .
indeed i do not !
i understand , as my younger sisters are not yet able to , that handsome young men must have something to live on , as well as the plain ones .
miss bennet ... .. i would wish you to believe me that ... had circumstances been different ...
had old mr darcy never had a son .
oh , yes .
but life is full of these trials , as my sister mary reminds us daily .
i sincerely wish you every happiness in the world .
you are very forbearing .
i flatter myself i am !
i think jane would be quite proud of me .
i hope you and i , at least , will always be good friends .
i' m sure we shall , mr wickham .
well , lizzy , on pleasure bent again .
never a thought of what your poor parents will suffer in your absence ?
it is a pleasure i could well forego , father , as i think you know .
but i shall be happy to see charlotte .
what of your cousin mr collins and the famous lady catherine de bourgh ?
as a connoisseur of human folly , i thought you impatient to be savouring these delights .
of some delights , i believe , sir , a little goes a long way .
yes .
well , think of me , lizzy .
until you or your sister jane return , i shall not hear two words of sense spoken together .
you' il be very much missed , my dear .
very well , very well .
go along then .
get along with you .
aye , maria .
all that land to the left of us belongs to rosings park .
all of it ?
oh , lady catherine must be very rich indeed !
i believe so , i believe so !
and she has many favours in her gift .
your sister has made a fortunate alliance !
yes , well ,
i believe the next turn takes us on to hunsford .
sir william !
maria !
cousin elizabeth .
i am truly honoured to be able to welcome you to my humble abode !
my dear sir !
my dear mr collins !
i am deeply honoured to make a humble welcome to the parsonage ...
i am happy to see you , elizabeth .
and i you .
the staircase , i flatter myself , is eminently suitable for a clergyman in my position , being neither too shallow nor too steep .
as serviceable a staircase as i' ve ever seen , sir .
at st. james ' court ...
though it is nothing to the staircases you will see at rosings .
i say staircases , because there are several , and each in its way very fine .
and here , if you would permit me , cousin elizabeth .
this will be your bedchamber , while you are with us .
and i trust you will find it comfortable and convenient .
indeed it is a very pleasant room .
observe that closet , cousin elizabeth .
what do you say to that ?
well ...
is it not the very essence of practicality and convenience ?
lady catherine de bourgh herself was kind enough to suggest that these shelves be fitted .
shelves in the closet ...
happy thought indeed .
she is kindness itself .
nothing is too small to be beneath her notice , is it not , my dear ?
she is a very attentive neighbour .
we dine at rosings park twice every week !
and are never allowed to walk home .
that is generosity itself , is it not , maria ?
her ladyship' s carriage is regularly ordered for us .
i should say one of her ladyship' s carriages , for she has several .
and now , sir william , you were kind enough to express a wish to see my gardens .
mr collins tends the gardens himself , and spends a good part of every day in them .
the exercise must be beneficial .
oh , yes .
i encourage him to be in his garden as much as possible .
and he has to walk to rosings nearly every day .
so often ?
is that necessary ?
perhaps not , but i confess i encourage him in that as well .
walking is very beneficial exercise .
oh , indeed it is .
when he' s in the house , he is mostly in his book room , which affords a good view of the road , whenever lady catherine' s carriage should drive by .
and you prefer to sit in this parlour ?
yes .
so , it often happens that a whole day passes in which we haven' t spent more than a few minutes in each other' s company .
i see .
i find that i can bear the solitude very cheerfully .
i find myself ... .. quite content with my situation , lizzy .
charlotte , come quickly !
what is it ?
lizzy !
lizzy !
come into the dining room .
there' s such a sight to be seen !
make haste !
look , lizzy , look !
is this all ?
i expected the pigs had got into the garden !
here' s only lady catherine and her daughter .
no , that' s old mrs jenkinson .
with her is miss anne de bourgh !
she' s rude to keep charlotte out in this wind !
what a little creature she is !
i like her appearance .
she looks sickly and cross .
yes , she will do very well .
she' il make him a proper wife .
who , lizzy ?
mark the windows .
there are 64 in all .
64 !
and i have it on good authority that the glazing alone originally cost in excess of 600 pounds !
it' s a very handsome building , and prettily situated , sir .
and by no means lacking in windows .
do not make yourself uneasy , my dear cousin , about your apparel .
lady catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress , which becomes herself and her daughter .
she won' t think the worse of you for being simply dressed .
she likes to preserve the distinction of rank .
thank you , mr collins , that is a great comfort .
an apothecary will serve your needs quite adequately .
make sure it be no one but nicholson , mrs collins .
i shall be extremely angry if i hear you have gone elsewhere .
i have no intention to , lady catherine .
no indeed .
no intention at all .
well .
your friend appears to be quite a genteel pretty sort of girl , mrs collins .
her father' s estate is entailed on mr collins , i understand .
yes , ma' am , and i am , believe me ...
do you have brothers and sisters , miss bennet ?
yes , ma' am , i am the second of five sisters .
are any of your younger sisters out ?
yes , ma' am , all of them .
all ?
what ?
all five out at once ?
the younger ones out before the older are married ?
your youngest sisters must be very young ?
yes , ma' am , my youngest is not sixteen .
well !
she is full young to be out much in company .
but really , ma' am , i think it would be hard upon younger sisters , that they not have their share of society and amusement , simply because their elder sisters have not the means or inclination to marry early .
sir william , wouldn' t you agree ?
well ...
upon my word !
you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person !
pray , what is your age ?
with three younger sisters grown up , your ladyship can hardly expect me to own it .
miss bennet , you cannot be more than twenty , i am sure .
therefore there is no need to conceal your age !
i am not one and twenty .
mrs collins , did i tell you of lady metcalf' s calling on me yesterday to thank me for sending her miss pope ?
lady catherine , " said she ,
you have given me a treasure . " yes !
yes .
it is beautiful .
i could grow almost as fond of these woods and hills as you have .
lizzy ?
we have been here three weeks , and already we have dined at rosings park six times !
i would never have expected it to be so many !
no , nor i.
my dear !
maria !
cousin elizabeth !
mr darcy is arrived at rosings !
and with him his cousin , colonel fitzwilliam !
the younger son of the earl of matlock !
they have vouchsafed us the greatest honour .
they are coming to call upon us !
when , my dear ?
even now , mrs collins !
they' re hard upon my heels !
make haste !
this must be due to you .
mr darcy wouldn' t come so soon to wait upon me .
you' re mistaken , for he dislikes me as much as i do him .
make haste !
make haste !
delighted to make your acquaintance at last !
at last , sir ?
i' ve heard much of you , and the praise hasn' t been exaggerated .
i can well believe that .
mr darcy is my severest critic .
i hope we shall see you frequently at rosings .
i' m fond of lively conversation .
this you do not find at rosings park ?
my aunt does talk a great deal , but seldom requires a response .
my friend speaks hardly a word when he comes into kent , though he' s lively in other places .
nobody plays , nobody sings .
i believe you play and sing ?
a little , and very ill .
i wouldn' t wish to excite your anticipation .
i' m sure you' re too modest .
any relief would be profoundly welcome .
can you tell me why mr darcy keeps staring at me ?
what do you think offends him ?
i hope your family is in good health .
i thank you , yes .
my sister has been in town these three months .
have you not seen her ?
no .
no , i have not had that pleasure .
mr darcy and i are not the best of friends .
i' m surprised .
why should you be ?
i always believe in first impressions , and his good opinion once lost , is lost forever .
so you see , it is a hopeless case , is it not , colonel fitzwilliam ?
you will never play really well , miss bennet , unless you practise more .
you may come to rosings as often as you like , and play on the pianoforte in mrs jenkinson' s room .
she would be in nobody' s way in that part of the house .
thank you , ma' am .
there are few people in england , i suppose , who have more true enjoyment in music than myself .
or a better taste .
and if i had ever learnt , i should be a true proficient .
and so would anne .
do you mean to frighten me , mr darcy , by coming in all this state to hear me ?
i won' t be alarmed .
my courage always rises with every attempt to intimidate me .
i know you find great enjoyment in professing opinions which are not your own .
your cousin would teach you not to believe a word i say , colonel fitzwilliam .
that is ungenerous of him , is it not ?
it is indeed , darcy !
impolitic too , for it provokes me to retaliate and say somewhat of his behaviour in hertfordshire , which may shock his relations .
i' m not afraid of you .
what can you accuse him of ?
i should like to know how he behaves among strangers !
the first time i ever saw mr darcy was at a ball , where he danced only four dances , though gentlemen were scarce , and more than one lady was in want of a partner .
i' m sorry , but so it was .
i can well believe it !
i fear i am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers .
shall we ask him why ?
why a man of sense and education , who has lived in the world , should be ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers ?
i ...
i have not that talent which some possess , of conversing easily with strangers .
i do not play this instrument so well as i should wish to , but i have supposed that to be my own fault , because i would not take the trouble of practising !
you are perfectly right .
you have employed your time much better .
no one privileged of hearing you could think anything wanting .
we neither of us perform to strangers .
what are you talking of ?
what are you telling miss bennet ?
i must have my share in the conversation !
as for the daughter , she is a pale sickly creature with little conversation and no talent . / ' m sorry to be hard on any of our sex , but ...
mr darcy shows no inclination for her , and treats her with the same indifference he shows everyone , but lady catherine is determined to have him for a son in law , and she is not a woman to be gainsaid .
mr darcy .
mrs collins and maria are just now gone into hunsford village with my cousin .
you find me all alone this morning , mr darcy .
i beg your pardon .
i would not wish to intrude upon your privacy .
i was just writing a letter to my sister jane in london .
mr bingley and his sisters were well , i hope , when you left london ?
perfectly so , i thank you .
i understand mr bingley has not much idea for ever returning to netherfield ?
it is probable that he may spend little time there in the future .
if so , it would be better for the neighbourhood that he give up the place .
i should not be surprised if he were to give it up , as soon as any eligible purchase offers .
this seems a very comfortable house .
lady catherine , i believe , did much to it when mr collins came .
i believe she did .
and she couldn' t have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful recipient .
mr collins appears extremely fortunate in his choice of wife .
yes , indeed he is .
though seen in a prudential light , it is a good match for her as well .
it must be agreeable to her to live within easy distance of her family .
easy distance ?
it' s nearly fifty miles !
what is fifty miles of good road ?
yes , an easy distance .
near and far are relative terms .
it is possible for a woman to be settled too near her family .
yes , exactly .
you would not wish to be always near longbourn , i think .
i shall trespass on your time no longer .
please convey my regards to mrs collins and her sister .
no , no , please don' t trouble yourself .
miss bennet !
colonel fitzwilliam .
i' ve been making the yearly tour of the park .
shall we take this way together ?
with pleasure .
do you know mr bingley and his sisters ?
a little .
bingley is a pleasant , gentleman like man .
he' s a great friend of darcy' s .
yes .
mr darcy is uncommonly kind to mr bingley , and takes a prodigious deal of care of him .
yes , i believe darcy does take care of him .
i ...
i understand that he congratulates himself on having saved mr bingley the inconvenience of a most imprudent marriage .
did mr darcy give his reasons for this interference ?
i understand there were some very strong objections to the lady .
and why was he to be the judge ?
you' re disposed to think his interference officious ?
i don' t see what right mr darcy had to determine and direct in what way his friend was to be happy .
but , as you say , we know none of the particulars .
perhaps there was not much affection .
perhaps not .
but if that were the case , it lessens the honour of my cousin' s triumph very sadly , don' t you think ?
miss bennet , are you unwell ?
a sudden headache .
perhaps i have walked too far today .
let us take the shorter way back .
you' re sure ?
i would willingly stay at home with you , and brave all lady catherine' s displeasure .
my dear charlotte , i beg you to consider ...
i shall be quite all right .
it' s only a headache .
it will pass , and more speedily in quiet and solitude .
i am quite sure , when all the circumstances are explained to lady catherine , she will not be angry , for she has indeed such christian generosity of spirit ...
my dear , the time !
my dear !
why did you not say before ?
i cannot begin to count the occasions on which her ladyship has impressed upon me the importance of punctuality ...
forgive me .
i hope you are feeling better .
i am , thank you .
will you not sit down ?
in vain i have struggled .
it will not do !
my feelings will not be repressed .
you must allow me to tell you how ardently i admire and love you .
in declaring myself thus i' m aware that i will be going expressly against the wishes of my family , my friends , and , i hardly need add , my own better judgement .
the relative situation of our families makes any alliance between us a reprehensible connection .
as a rational man i cannot but regard it as such myself , but it cannot be helped .
almost from the earliest moments , i have come to feel for you ... .. a passionate admiration and regard , which despite my struggles , has overcome every rational objection .
i beg you , most fervently , to relieve my suffering and consent to be my wife .
in such cases as these , i believe the established mode is to express a sense of obligation .
but i cannot .
i have never desired your good opinion , and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly .
i' m sorry to cause pain to anyone , but it was unconsciously done , and i hope will be of short duration .
and this is all the reply i am to expect ?
i might wonder why , with so little effort at civility , i am rejected .
i might wonder why , with so evident a desire to offend me , you chose to tell me that you like me against your will , your reason , and even against your character !
was this not some excuse for incivility if i was uncivil ?
i have every reason in the world to think ill of you .
what could tempt me to accept the man who has ruined the happiness of a most beloved sister ?
can you deny that you have done it ?
i have no wish to deny it .
i did everything in my power to separate my friend from your sister and i rejoice in my success .
towards him i have been kinder than towards myself .
it' s not merely that on which my dislike of you is founded .
long before , my dislike was decided when i heard mr wickham' s story of your dealings with him .
how can you defend yourself on that subject ?
such interest in that gentleman' s concerns !
who that knows of his misfortunes , can help feeling an interest ?
his misfortunes !
yes , his misfortunes have been great indeed !
and of your infliction !
you have reduced him to his present state of poverty , and yet you can treat his misfortunes with contempt and ridicule !
and this is your opinion of me ?
my faults by this calculation are heavy indeed .
perhaps these offences might have been overlooked , had not your pride been hurt by the confession of the scruples which long prevented my forming serious design on you .
had i concealed my struggles and flattered you .
but disguise of every sort is my abhorrence .
nor am i ashamed of the feelings i related .
they were natural .
did you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections ?
to congratulate myself on the hope of relations whose condition in life is so below my own ?
you are mistaken , mr darcy .
your declaration merely spared me any concern for refusing you , had you been more gentleman like .
you could not make me the offer of your hand in any way that would tempt me to accept it .
from the beginning , your manners convinced me of your arrogance , your conceit , and your selfish disdain for the feelings of others .
within a month , i felt you were the last man whom i could ever marry !
you' ve said quite enough , madam .
i perfectly comprehend your feelings ... .. and now have only to be ashamed of what my own have been .
please forgive me for having taken up your time ... .. and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness .
