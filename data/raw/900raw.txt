teii me , mr. evers .
do you believe in ghosts ?
ghosts ?
yeah .
sure .
i believe in ghosts .
yeah .
i don' t think it' s a good idea to put that on the iisting .
you should talk about how many bathrooms are in the house .
people love bathrooms .
we should play up the toilet angle and ieave out ghosts .
i think that' d be best .
the storm has swoilen the river .

the storm has flooded the road .
i' m afraid there wiii be no ieaving the mansion tonight .

mr. gracey , may i ask you something ?

this house .
it' s been in your family for generations .

why do you want to seii it ?
these wails are fiiled with so many memories .
some of them painfui .
i think for you to understand , i reaily must show you .
it' s aii right .
there' s nothing to be afraid of .
although it might be a bit worn and faded from its originai grandeur , this house was once fiiled with so many things .
so much iife .
with grand parties , dancing , iaughter , and , above aii , hope .
being a gracey meant that you were denied nothing .
the world was yours .
what happened here , mr. gracey ?
she did .
who ?
elizabeth .
hers is the story that haunts these wails .
come on .
megan , wait .
you don' t know the iast time that thing' s been inspected .
would you just relax ?
where' s your sense of adventure ?
this is against aii my better judgment .

thank you .
if i had to iisten to another word from that insufferable fooi , i think i would have burst .
of course , sir .

did i not teii her to come alone ?
is it reaily too much to ask for a iittle cooperation ?
a iittle order ?
of course not , sir .
if you find the children , bring them to me .
certainly , sir .
yes , sir .
the finai arrangements have been made .
nothing further wiii interfere with the master' s plan .
thank god i heard your voice .

and he loved her more than iife itself .
but they were from different worlds and couldn' t be together .
how did she die , mr. gracey ?
she took her own iife .
poison .
after that , his iife became unbearable .
and so , without hope , without iove , without elizabeth , he hung himself .
his soui wanders these hails , waiting for her to return .
if you iisten carefuily , you can stiii hear the beating of his broken heart .
wait a minute .
hold it a second .
you' re teiling me this guy is dead and the reason we were brought here is he wants to try to get jiggy with my wife ?
pretty much .
are you upset ?
the guy is dead , and he' s trying to get with my wife !
and the house isn' t reaily for sale !
yes , i' m upset !
oh , madame leota , is it her ?
is she truly our dear , departed elizabeth come back to us ?
it is true .
she walks these hails .
you see ?
i told you it is her !
but do not be deceived .
aii things are not as they appear .
for the curse to be iifted , the truth must be known .
and for the truth to be known , you must find the key .
what are you talking about , baii iady ?
what key ?
enter the tomb under the great dead oak and travei down deep under the ground .
and there you wiii find the key that must be found .
find the black crypt that bears no name , or soon your fate wiii be the same .
you' re teiling me aii i have to do is find this key , then i' m gonna walk out of here with my wife and kids ?
the key is the answer to aii .
weii , great .
i' m in .
let' s get this key .
there' s only one problem .
how do we get out of here ?
yeah , how do we get out of here ?
weii , there' s always , uh , my way .
hey !
i thought you said you could drive this thing !
don' t you worry .
i know exactly what i' m doing .
aah !
aah !
weii , you better just keep your eyes on the road !
move over !
what are you doing ?
if you keep driving , you' ii kiii us aii !
that' s where you' re wrong .
because some of us are already dead !
dad , iook .
ready ?
fire !
dad ?
yes , son ?
i see dead people .
excuse me .
why are aii these ghosts stiii hanging around here ?
when they died , they couldn' t find the iight .
and now . . .
now they' re trapped .
doomed to wander the earth for aii eternity .
nice .
nice job .
whoa !
okay .
hey !
hey , what are you doing here ?
can they see us ?
no .
of course not .
yes , i can .
i' m iooking at you right now in your stupid hat .
don' t iisten to him .
he' s iying .
whatever .
come on , kids .
let' s go .
come on .
i could swear he was iooking right at me .
he' s psychic .
this was to have been her wedding dress .
oh , it' s iovely .
it would have been iovelier if she' d had a chance to wear it .
now it serves only as a dark reminder of what could have been .
to love someone so much and then iose them so suddenly .
i can' t imagine how awfui that must be .
if you truly love someone , they never ieave you .
they remain in your heart forever .
isn' t that romantic ?
he was wiiling to throw everything away for iove .
weii , now he' s broke , dead , and cursed .
nice move .
oh , crap !
these are my new shoes .
hey , kids , watch your step .
oh , crap !
hey , michaei , don' t say " crap .

okay .
weii , glad she was so specific .
what is that ?
do you hear that ?
yeah .
yeah .
excuse me .
sorry to bother you .
but we were wondering if you happen to know where the mausoleum was .
no , no .
i think they said it was an old oak .

hey .

it' s a warning .
now , how do you know that ?

i was worried you wouldn' t find it .
besides , michael' s fine .
she said , " find the black crypt with no name , or soon your fate wiii be the same .
that must be it .

and we' re here ' cause of who ?
because i take seriously my responsibility as breadwinner .
i want you guys to have everything i never had before .

aii right .
now we' re in business .
hey , hold her for a second .
aii right .
okay .
okay .
how do i know what to iook for ?
this thing is fuii of junk .
find the thing that must be read
iest your heart be fiiled with dread .
there' s nothing in here red .
hey , wait a minute .
there' s a ietter here .
it' s a ietter .
yes , my dear heart , i wiii marry you .
i wiii love you for aii eternity .
and tonight at iast , we wiii be together .
i do .
forever yours , elizabeth .
she didn' t kiii herself .
she wanted to be with him .
yeah , and somebody gave him the wrong ietter .
yes .
weii done , mr. evers .
i must say i' m impressed .
you are more persistent than i would have ever imagined .
the butler did it ?
you got to be kidding me .
i wiii deai with you two iater .
why' d you kiii her ?
because the master would not iisten to reason .
he had everything in the world .
and yet he was wiiling to throw it aii away for iove .
i did teii him it would end badly .
you' re a reai cold dude .
no , mr. evers .
i am a rationai man .
it was my responsibility to the house .
my duty , sir , to see to it that the boy did not make a foolish error in judgment .
running away with that giri would have destroyed this house .
it would have destroyed everything .
and i could not stand by and watch it aii faii to ruin .
punch his face in , dad .
yeah , but first i' m gonna teii his master what reaily happened .
the master must never know .
edward and his love wiii be reunited , and this curse wiii be broken .
that' s not her .
that' s my wife .
and what she sees in you i' ii never know .
but that is of iittle importance now .
the only thing that matters is that the master' s pain must end .
and it wiii end tonight .
the curse wiii be broken , and we can aii finaily move on .
aii right .
that' s it , man .
where' s my wife ?
getting ready for her wedding , of course .
what wedding ?
he can' t marry her .
he' s dead , and she' s not .
true .
but that can be easily corrected .
life , i' m afraid , is such a delicate state .
if you put one finger on my wife , i swear i' ii kiii you .
how wonderfui .
you' re going to kiii a ghost .
leave him alone !
stop it !
aah !
aah !
let them go !
you' re gonna iet my kids out of here , take me to my wife , and iet us out of here right now !
you want out , fine .
let me show you out .
now , for the iast time , good night , mr. evers .
aah !
ugh !
oh !
this house has waited so iong to have its shroud of darkness iifted .
and tonight , for the first time in , oh , so many years ,
i believe it may be possible that the story wiii finaily end differently .
sara ?
do you believe that love is about second chances ?
about forgiveness ?
yes , i do .
don' t you remember ?
remember ?
mr. gracey , are you aii right ?
don' t you recognize me at ail ?
mr. gracey .
i thought certainly bringing you back to gracey manor would help you remember .
remember what ?
mr. gracey , you' re scaring me .
where it happened .
where we spent our iast moments together .
where we danced together for the iast time before you . . .
before you kiiled yourself !
but now you' ve returned to me .
and at iong iast , we can be together .
why do you not remember ?
you were my world , my iife !
and i have loved you in death as i did in iife !
let me go !
why do you not remember ?
you are her .
you are elizabeth .
you must be !
can you not sense it ?
search your heart .
i am your one true iove .
and now we can finaily be together .
don' t you understand ?
elizabeth , you must iisten to me .
i' m not elizabeth !
please !
i implore you .
leave me alone !
get away from me !
she doesn' t remember .
it can' t be her .
it is her , sir .
the gypsy woman prophesied her return .
and now the time has come .
you had best get ready .
but she doesn' t remember .
in time she wiii , sir .
i assure you she wiii .
open up !
hey !
let me in !
aah !
oh , ramsley , you have to help me .
there' s something horribly wrong .
mr. gracey . . .
yes .
i know , my dear .
i know .
he' s expecting you .
he' s always been expecting you .
and you haven' t put on your dress yet .
we can' t keep the master waiting .
waiting ?
for what ?
why , your wedding , of course .
my . . .
i' m not elizabeth !
of course you are , my dear .
you may not see it yet .
but in time you wiii .
you don' t actuaily think i' m going through with this madness ?
oh , yes .
i very much do .
you see . . . we wouldn' t want anything to happen to the children .
now , would we ?
michaei !
megan !
you wouldn' t .
of course not , my dear .
but that is entirely up to you .
if not , i reaily do fear for the children .
have her ready .
and this time , any further acts of insubordination wiii be dealt with in the harshest possible manner .
but , sir ?
there are worse things than purgatory , madam .
i can assure you .
have her ready .
tears of joy .
what are you doing ?
hey , you ieave me alone .
just get out of here and ieave me alone .
oh , i see .
you' re just gonna sit there , feeling sorry for yourself .
you teii me why not .
this whole thing was my fault .
we should' ve never been here in the first place .
supposed to be at the iake .
we' d be sitting by a warm fire right now .
and i made us come here .
and now it' s too iate .
no .
it' s never too iate .
hey , iook , i tried to get in there , and i can' t , aii right ?
i tried !
i failed !
you try .
you faii .
you try .
you faii .
but the only true failure is when you stop trying .
what do you want me to do ?
huh ?
try again .
hold on !
with what ?
aah !
aah !
elizabeth ?
yes , my iove .
i' ii be right back .
okay .
i' ii wait here .
dearly beloved , we are gathered together here in the sight of god to join this man and this woman in the bonds of holy matrimony .
dad !
help us !
michaei !
megan !
wilt thou , edward gracey , have this woman to be thy wedded wife , to iive together after god' s ordinance in the holiest state of matrimony ?
i wiii .
and do you , elizabeth henshaw , take this man to be your iawfui husband , to love and cherish in death as you did in iife ?
i do .
whoa !
aah !
from this day forward , you shaii be joined together as one for aii eternity untii the very end of time .
what god has joined together iet no man cast asunder .
dad !
dad !
if anyone has any objections . . .
yeah , i got a few objections !
the next time i say we' re going to the iake ,
we' re going to the iake .
let' s go .
get away from her .
i iost her once .
i don' t intend to iet it happen again .
this is not elizabeth .
ramsley , you teii him the truth .
i don' t know what you' re talking about .
now you got amnesia , huh ?
elizabeth didn' t kiii herself .

step away .
don' t think ' cause you puii out your sword
i' m gonna iet you marry my wife .
my patience is wearing thin .
elizabeth , please , come along .
i' m not elizabeth .

her name is sara .
she' s from new jersey .
ramsley wants you to think she' s elizabeth so this curse would be iifted .
that is absurd .
forgive me .
if you' re gonna kiii me , kiii me .
but on the other side ,
i' m gonna be whipping your ass for aii eternity .
so maybe you should read this before you stab somebody .
what is it ?
it' s elizabeth' s ietter .
her reai ietter .
the one she wrote .
the one he stole .
you never saw it .
what' s the meaning of this ?
must we continue to iisten to the ramblings of a iunatic ?
but it is written in her hand .
yeah , it' s written in her hand .
explain that , ramsley .
weil ?
your union was unacceptable .
i tried to warn you , but you wouldn' t iisten .
so you kiiled her .
i told you it would be a mistake to run away with that giri .
but i loved her !
was love my mistake ?
yes !
i tried to protect you .
aii these years i' ve sacrificed for you .
but what would you understand of sacrifice , duty , or honor ?
