sorry , sir .
good luck , charles .
remember me to the old woman !
i will , harry , i will .
say hello to the big world .
bye bye .
goodbye , mr bridger .
he said , " goodbye , mr bridger .
well , he' s going .
as long as he doesn' t come back .
that' s all i care .
they say he' s going to do a job in ltaly .
i hope he likes spaghetti .
they serve it four times a day in ltalian prisons .
well , you' re the last person i expected to see , lorna .
oh , charlie , i' ve been counting the days .
yeah ?
well , why didn' t you come and see me when i was inside ?
charlie , you know that' s not my scene .
sitting holding your hands across the table , with those weeping wives around with their howling kids , the guards looking at me as if something' s hidden up my dress .
i did miss you , charlie .
yeah ?
erm ...
i , erm ... made an appointment for you to go to the tailor first .
then on to the shirtmaker ...
this car belongs to the pakistani ambassador .
it does ?
typical , isn' t it ?
out of jail five minutes and already i' m in a hot car .
i just wanted you to come out in style , baby !
take me to my tailor .
very elegant , sir , though you' ve put on a little weight .
well , er ...
i' ve been in america .
it' s the bread in the hamburgers .
is that so ?
well , i' m glad you' re out .
i mean , back .
i don' t want to be rude , charles , but times have changed .
adrian , when i went in that was all the go .
what did you do ?
life ?
you know , you could put all these in a museum .
i' il tell you what i' il do with you , adrian .
i' il take this lot now .
revolting .
eh ?
i' il take this lot now .
you wrap ' em up .
and will you shorten the sleeves , love ?
i' m not a gorilla .
yes !
well , there we are , captain croker .
i think you' il find we' ve kept it in perfect tone .
i' il run the engine for you , shall i ?
you' il be able to hear what it sounds like .
there , how' s that ?
i say .
yes ?
i say .
hello ?
there you are .
i thought i' d lost you !
no , i came round here .
erm ...
i was just thinking , maybe it needs a little more air through the second carburettor .
oh , do you think so ?
listen .
yes , maybe you' re right .
i' il ...
i' il do it .
just stay there .
would you open the bonnet for me , please ?
thank you .
i wonder if you' d hold this for me ?
the , er ... ?
the bonnet .
of course .
thank you .
i didn' t quite ...
yes .
there we are .
you want me to ...
hold .
thank you .
there we are .
now ...
yes .
i can , er ...
how are you doing ?
i can see what' s wrong .
it' s very small .
no , i don' t know .
it' s alright .
leave it , leave it .
shall i ... ?
yes , you shut it and i' il lock it .
thank you .
how are you doing ?
long time since i was in here .
i dare say !
there we are .
i haven' t been in this car for so long .
yes , i gather you' ve been in india for two years , sir .
yes , shooting tigers .
really ?
splendid .
the garage bill , sir .
yes ?
i' m afraid it' s 200 .
if you insist , we can charge it .
no .
please !
there' s a bounty for shooting tigers .
well ...
yes , it' s 50 a head .
really ?
there' s no need to pay ...
these are bundles of 200 .
there' s no need to pay now .
it' s alright .
yes , you must have shot an awful lot of tigers , sir .
yes , i used a machine gun .
calling mr r j williams .
mr williams to reception , please ...
lord croker .
i am expected .
yes , your lordship .
suite 602 .
and there' s a message .
thank you .
hello , charlie !
shut the door , charlie .
you' il cause a terrible draught .
ladies ?
charlie !
hello , charlie !
love you , charlie .
ciao !
nice charlie .
good to see you , charlie .
well , i thought , a coming out present !
very nice .
now , what would you like ?
everything .
where' s your old man ?
dead .
in the alps , in a car crash .
it wasn' t an accident .
oh .
well , there goes the job , then .
wait , mr croker .
yes , mrs beckerman ?
this is for you .
what' s this ?
some sort of a consolation prize ?
plans that my husband didn' t have time to complete .
he wants you to finish them .
oh , he does , does he ?
tell me , erm ... where do you figure in the plans your husband didn' t have time to complete ?
i don' t .
i am going to new york tomorrow at 6 : 00am .
ah .
pity .
but ... that still gives us four hours to kill .
and you still in your widow' s weeds ...
charlie croker , i am dead .
hello , roger .
i have arranged for my widow
to get material to you in england .
yes , i got it .
there you must find the backing to do the job .
you must , charlie .
because it is a work of genius .
just think of it .
a city in chaos , a smash and grab raid and four million dollars through a traffic jam .
four million dollars ?
this is the city of turin , the industrial capital of italy .
the most modern in europe , famed for its architecture , and soon , i trust , for the greatest robbery of the 20th century .
this is the flat armoured convoy .
it leaves turin airport every week .
it never carries less than four million dollars .
i think we could take that over .
to reach its destination the convoy has to travel through one of the busiest traffic systems in europe , a system controlled by television cameras and by the computer in this building , the turin traffic control centre .
if you can get into this room , charlie , you will cause the biggest traffic jam in the history of the world .
every street will be paralysed .
and then you will have a chance to ambush that convoy .
very nice .
now , charlie , first you neutralise the tv cameras which overlook the convoy' s route .
you do this with these little gadgets here .
look .
yeah .
second , you break into the computer building and substitute this new program .
got it .
this causes the jam .
right .
third , you attack the convoy in your own inimitable way , charlie .
and fourth , you escape , on the only route out of the city which is not blocked up with traffic .
you' il find details of the route in this portfolio .
within just two hours , you will be over the alps and into switzerland .
and within three you' il have the money safe in a geneva bank .
make it work , charlie !
i will , roger .
four million dollars , through a traffic jam .
money received from brighton is 15, 000 .
hello .
camp freddie ?
croker !
aren' t you in italy ?
i want to see bridger .
mr bridger to you .
i' ve got a job .
if it' s the gpo , city road , it' s being done next week .
this job is bigger than anything bridger' s done up until now .
if it' s the bank of england , it' s out .
mr bridger' s very worried about the economy .
exactly , freddie !
tell bridger this is a foreign job to help with this country' s balance of payments .
charlie , i don' t think you have the kind of scheme that yields the size of profit mr bridger is accustomed to .
but , freddie , this job is big .
charlie , you wouldn' t even know how to spell big .
b i g. big .
now , butch harry , tell us about fulham .
well , now ...
fulham .
a bit dodgy at the moment .
how are you ?
how do you feel about a little outing ?
hello , hazel .
hazel , my lovely , out you come .
come on , then .
there you are .
it' s a long time since you' ve seen the nightlife , innit ?
where' s my torch ?
where' s my bloody torch ?
good evening , mr bridger .
croker !
mr bridger , i' ve got a job lined up .
get out of here .
it' s all here .
maps , drawings , plans , everything .
you' ve been put up to this , bribed to upset my natural rhythm and ruin my health .
no , mr bridger .
this is important .
four million dollars .
europe .
the common market .
italy , the flat car factory .
croker , this is my toilet .
please .
just read it .
get out .
are you alright , mr bridger ?
are you alright ?
he' s alright !
i can always take it to the americans .
they' re people who recognise young talent , give it a chance , they are .
last night , mr governor , my toilet was broken into .
toilet ?
toilet .
broken into ?
broken into .
well , i' m ... terribly sorry .
there are some places which , to an englishman , are sacred .
well , i' ve apologised , bridger .
and so you should have .
you are not doing your job properly .
her majesty' s prison is there not only to keep people getting out , but to prevent people getting in .
you are symptomatic of the lazy , unimaginative management which is driving this country on the rocks !
well ... is there anything else ?
no , thank you , governor .
by the way , mr bridger , did you happen to recognise the man who so rudely interrupted you ?
i' ve never seen him before in my life .
i want charlie croker given a good going over .
yes , mr bridger .
tell camp freddie .
yes , mr bridger .
i don' t want him killed .
just given a good going over .
i understand exactly what you mean .
do you , keats ?
that' s very imaginative of you .
sir , two volumes of the anglo american trade .
and uk balance of payments , 1966 and ' 67 .
and ...
i' ve also brought you the illustrated london news , sir .
for why , keats , for why ?
the queen' s in it , sir .
hmm .
that' s good of you .
er ... sir , i often wonder whether you' re going to top your career by doing a job on their house .
keats , there are more things to life than breaking and entering .
yes , mr bridger .
while we' re on the subject ,
i notice that some of that young mob in e block don' t stand for the national anthem , at the end of the nightly tv .
tell them to do so , or they will incur my displeasure .
yes , mr bridger .
alright , be off with you .
get the word to camp freddie .
sir .
right then , fred , come on .
wait a minute .
take your filthy clothes , too !
this is my man , my territory , and don' t come back !
charlie' s been caught on the job .
ok , charlie .
alright , where are you ?
i know you' re in here .
there' s no use hiding .
you had three birds in here .
you didn' t mind at the hotel .
that was a coming out present .
i didn' t get a chance to enjoy it .
i didn' t enjoy it today , neither .
coming in causing a fracas .
ask me where i' ve been .
you' ve been with the law .
yes , for taking the ambassador' s car and for not paying the hotel bill .
you deserted me !
don' t come the moody .
you know how the game is .
no , you left me to my fate .
usual one , was it ?
24 hours in prison .
it was humiliating .
how did you get out ?
the ambassador for pakistan was very sweet .
very sweet , was he ?
and so was the hotel manager .
lorna , i knew you' d be alright .
no thanks to you , charlie croker , i can tell you .
lorna , i was busy , wasn' t i ? !
oh !
so i see !
so i came in here and saw !
i want you out .
if you don' t think i mean it , then you' re wrong !
charlie !
it' s the law , charlie !
what did you tell them ?
would i tell them anything ?
of course you would .
morning .
hello , croker .
we' ve come with mr bridger' s compliments .
sorry it' s like this , charlie .
listen , lads , er ... you wouldn' t hit a fella ... with no trousers on .
would you ?
ok , then , put ' em on .
get away from me !
have you seen croker ?
yes , mr bridger .
well , i want you to see him again .
he won' t take kindly to that .
i' m interested in his scheme .
but , mr bridger ...
what you fail to realise is that we have a new objective .
the chinese are giving flat four million dollars in gold , as a down payment on a car plant they' re constructing near peking .
but croker ...
croker can handle it .
he' s got everything going for him .
there' s even a football match in turin the day before the delivery .
england versus ltaly .
the english supporters can cover his movements , even help him , if required .
there' s only one snag .
we need an expert in computers to look after the technical end .
the top man is professor peach .
i' ve seen him on television .
tell croker to get him .
but how ?
maybe the professor' s not bent .
camp freddie , everybody in the world is bent .
well , my brother' s no longer with us , i' m afraid .
no .
you mean , he' s ...
oh , no , no , nothing like that .
well , actually , he' s in a home .
yes .
we thought it best .
for his own good .
er ... was it , er ... serious , miss peach ?
pam .
serious , was it ?
what ?
your brother .
in the home .
oh , yes , i' m afraid it was quite serious , dear .
isn' t this greenfly awful ?
yes .
yes , well , not to put a too fine point to it , he was discovered ... in the lounge .
er ... doing what , miss peach ?
where ?
in the , er ... lounge .
oh , yes , he was doing it .
yes .
what ?
oh .
well , something quite obscene .
with annette .
a net ?
annette .
she was terrified , of course .
naturally .
yes , well , would you like some tea ?
eh ?
tea .
would you like some ?
you' re very kind .
yes , please .
good .
excuse me a minute .
annette ?
annette , would you serve tea in the lounge , dear ?
i shouldn' t let her do that , dear .
that gives them ideas .
this is annette .
professor peach , do you see what i' m getting at ?
mmm .
your brawn , my brain .
i' m not stupid , you know .
cooperation , isn' t it ?
like that flagpole out there .
flagpole ?
the flagpole in the yard .
i know if there was a convex mirror up there , 27 vertical , 42 horizontal , i could see straight into matron' s bedroom !
but somebody else would have to be up the pole .
couldn' t do it myself .
cooperation , you see ?
she' s a big woman .
here ...
wait till you see them italian birds .
are they big ?
i like them big .
they' re enormous .
really ?
very , very , very big .
would we , er ... wear stockings over our heads ?
no need for you to .
oh .
i' d like that .
i could steal one of matron' s , couldn' t i ?
we' il have you out of here in no time .
i wouldn' t want to get matron into trouble .
not that way , anyway !
she' s big .
big !
look out the window , professor .
what ?
look out at my car .
car ?
wh wh what car ?
down there .
gentlemen , gentlemen .
please , gentlemen .
please .
we are about to do a job in italy and i would like to introduce you all to each other .
first , bill bailey .
he' il be my number two .
you all know bill .
he' s just done three years in parkhurst .
as honest as the day is long .
you can trust him .
second , the getaway .
this will be done in three mini coopers .
and they will be driven by chris , tony and dominic .
hello , chaps .
alright !
these chinless wonders will get you out of turin faster than anyone else on four wheels .
remember that .
when we get to the alps , we will transfer to a coach .
the coach will be driven by william here , better known as big william , for very obvious reasons .
now , we come to the professor here , who is in charge of all matters relating to the turin computer .
i don' t want anyone putting him down because he' s a man of reading .
i know he' s got some ... very funny habits , but make him feel at home .
he' s very important to the operation .
finally , and very quickly , i would like to introduce all the lads who are going to do the job with me .
arthur , frank , rozzer , coco ,
yellow , camp freddie you all know .
roger , dave and lorna will be in reserve with three fast cars in case anything goes wrong .
right ?
now , it' s a very difficult job and the only way to get through it is , we all work together as a team .
and that means you do everything i say .
here' s charlie .
putting the jib on .
don' t just stand there .
get on with something .
i' m seeing he does it right .
get on with it .
rozzer ?
trouble with his differential .
tell him to hurry up .
hurry up .
dippers for the continent .
other way round .
are they quartz iodide ?
that' s right , guvnor .
alright .
we couldn' t afford gold , so we' re using lead .
will it take the weight ?
eh ?
take the weight .
will it take the weight ?
mind your face , charles .
alright ?
ok , but i don' t like the colour .
it' s beautiful , beautiful , beautiful !
carry on .
he really needs all this equipment ?
he says he does .
no .
you' re meant to use your brakes , chris .
terribly sorry , charles .
how many cars have we got left ?
a couple .
ok , next one .
let' s hope he gets it right .
what do you mean they' re written off ?
a series of accidents , mr bridger .
i promise there' il be no more .
five , four , three , two , one .
go .
you' re only supposed to blow the bloody doors off !
how' s your new house , fred ?
very nice , mr bridger , thank you .
very nice .
my pleasure .
beckerman' s done his homework very well .
the getaway is possible , but not easy .
for a start , the attack has to be made in this square .
and it must be completed inside of three minutes .
apart from knocking over a few old dears , we' il manage it .
you all understand what you' ve got to do ?
ok ?
now , bill .
er ...
oh , yeah .
the transporters will move in here and here .
they' il block off the main drag .
right .
roger .
erm ...
arthur and lorna park the three fast cars here in case we have to make a quick getaway .
correct .
it' s 12 : 10 .
the bullion van will be entering the piazza and will be forced slowly towards the centre .
it' s the old over and under routine .
first we go over the traffic , through the museums .
and then under again .
and up into this church .
the difficulty is here .
if the police can get a car onto that bridge before we' ve got across it , we' re done for .
but it' s a gamble we' ve got to take .
now , the bullion wagon is here .
right ?
dominic .
we get into the minis behind the piazza .
right .
arthur .
we drive the land rover into the square .
piazza , arthur , piazza .
sorry , charlie .
piazza .
the land rover is in the piazza .
and we come in right behind target .
that' s it .
wallop .
but since the bridge will be blocked by traffic the only possible way out is across the weir , which runs along by the side of the bridge .
i' ve only one comment about that , mr bridger .
good luck .
keats , i think we' d better arrange ... a funeral .
all ready to go , croker ?
yes , mr bridger .
the plans have been worked out to the last detail ?
yes , mr bridger .
everything taken care of ?
yes , mr bridger .
you' ve overlooked one thing .
the mafia .
they' il be waiting for you .
in every shot of camp freddie' s film there' s a mafia man .
if they were on to beckerman they' re on to us .
you' re not thinking of calling it off ?
as long as you know what you' re taking on .
yes .
the mafia .
yes .
the mafia .
you are about to take a half a ton of gold , in broad daylight , from under their noses .
they won' t like that .
that' s why they killed beckerman .
a question of prestige , is it ?
yes , it' s a question of prestige .
if you go through with this , you' ve got to win .
if you muck it up , don' t ever think of coming back , except in your coffin .
who' s that lot ?
the drivers .
that lot smashed up my cars .
practice makes perfect , mr bridger .
you pick ' em , don' t you ?
mr bridger will now say a few words .
what ?
your speech , sir .
we have come here to pay our respects to great aunt nellie .
she brought us up properly and taught us loyalty .
i want you to remember that during these next few days .
i also want you to remember that if you don' t come back with the goods ,
nellie here will turn in her grave .
and , likely as not , jump right out of it and kick your teeth in .
dave , take the valley road to turin , ok ?
go .
you three take the minis along the b road and keep the speed down .
right , go on , away you go .
freddie , stay with the bus .
big william , take the bus along the main road .
go !
go !
you lot , stay with me .
we' il go round the mountain route .
where' s peach ?
hey !
what do you think this is ?
a sunday school outing ?
pity people aren' t as lovely as flowers .
take your flowers and get in the car .
hurry up .
mr croker ?
that' s right .
six weeks ago , a friend of yours met with an accident on this very road .
so ?
do you mind if i show you how ?
no .
you just lost him his insurance bonus .
it cost beckerman his life .
listen , the gold arrives tomorrow .
and you think you can pick it up
like a bunch of groceries in the supermarket , hmm ?
just how are you going to do it ?
oh , excuse me .
does mr bridger think he can take over europe from a prison cell ?
your car ?
yeah .
pretty car .
paid for ?
very funny .
you' il be making a grave error if you kill us .
there are a quarter of a million italians in britain .
and they' il be made to suffer .
every restaurant , cafe , ice cream parlour , gambling den and nightclub in london , liverpool and glasgow , will be smashed .
mr bridger will drive them into the sea .
well , gentlemen , it' s a long walk back to england .
and it' s that way .
good morning .
may i salute our american cousin signor francesco cosca and his lovely wife ?
and may i raise my glass to signor altabani and his most beautiful wife , to thank him for his hospitality ?
and to congratulate him on the way he handled the english mob this morning .
i would not be too sure about the english , cousin .
they wouldn' t dare !
they are not so stupid as they look .
candles !
quickly !
gentlemen , we must assume they are here .
got your passport ?
i think so .
you need your passport directly after the tickets .
as you walk to the plane look neither right nor left .
just look straight ahead .
ok ?
keep going straight ahead .
geneva , please .
got it ?
neither to the right .
nor to the left .
straight ahead .
left .
straight ahead .
and keep going .
charlie , listen !
the plan was that we stay here .
the plan' s changed .
but why , charlie ?
why ?
because you' re a liability .
lorna , you see that lot out there ?
if we slip up , they' il tear us apart .
and ...
i don' t want you involved any more .
charlie ?
what ?
you care ?
get on the , er ... plane .
i' il see you ... in geneva .
have a cup of tea ready .
bye bye , charlie !
get on the plane .
get on the plane .
i love you , charlie !
hello , charlie !
hello , lads .
hello , charles .
hello , chris .
before we leave ...
bill ?
yes , charlie ?
i want every tin burned .
no fingerprints on anything in the house .
we' re wearing gloves .
you can' t be too careful .
is there a toilet here ?
of sorts .
out the back .
wash the handle and the seat .
no prints on that , either .
right , here is the crunch .
do you all know how to get there ?
actually , we can all read maps .
the map will be in your head .
i' m burning this one .
any questions ?
without the two jags and the aston , what if anything does go wrong ?
put your gloves on .
anything else ?
shall we synchronise our watches ?
nuts to your watches .
you just be there by quarter to and don' t get stuck in the traffic jam .
anything else ?
right .
away you go .
oh !
one more thing .
just remember , in this country they drive on the wrong side of the road .
bill ?
yes , charlie ?
bill !
yes , charlie ?
burn this for me , will you ?
yes , charlie .
oh , bill ?
yes , charlie ?
get rid of this lot .
yes , charlie .
they' re in a trattoria in the city .
they know where to put these ?
yes , you can see the cameras on the rooftops .
i can' t argue .
me in the front , you in the back .
he wants to sit up front with the driver .
i get sick in the back .
i' il get my migraine .
i' il be out like a light .
you are not going to be sick .
you' re not going to have migraine .
everybody is sitting in the back of the motor .
me in the back of the motor , with my asthma ?
one more word out of you , arthur ...
alright ?
alright .
now , everybody , all your gear in here .
get your gear out .
pens , wallets , passports , photos of your girlfriend .
and those cards .
put ' em in ' ere .
i' m going to need these cards .
what ?
put them in here !
i want mascots , money , bottle openers . ... in london i was up drainpipes and the game was up .
all i had to do , all the time .
what ?
i' m getting a contact !
let' s hear it .
turn it up .
i' il turn it up .
how about that ? !
how about what ?
they' ve finished loading the gold .
right , get dressed .
right , away you go .
away you go .
grazie .
molto bene , dad .
ok , let' s go .
can you direct me to corso garibaldi street ?
bloody foreigners .
excuse me .
blimey !
bloody grand prix !
what the devil is happening ?
a traffic jam .
it gets worse every time .
we' ve lost the convoy .
indietro !
any minute now .
it' s like the black hole of calcutta in here .
shut it , arthur .
what are they gabbling about , franco ?
complaining about the jam .
it won' t be the only complaint .
keep calm .
get off my feet !
alright , alright !
get yourselves sorted out and shut up !
no one talks now except me .
now , now , now !
now !
get in front of it !
put your helmets on .
hold tight .
now !
go round !
get in front of it .
oi !
put that bloody water cannon out !
ok , bill .
in you come !
in !
in !
back !
back !
hey !
unload !
unload !
where do you think you' re going ? !
get on with it !
get in the car .
get back up there .
if anybody comes through , hit ' em .
ok , charlie , that' s it .
right .
you , you and you in the dormobile .
get in the car .
oi !
get in the dormobile .
get your finger out .
get a move on , then !
well , look happy , you stupid bastards !
we won , didn' t we ?
they went thattaway .
i could eat a horse !
good luck !
put your foot down , tony .
they' re getting rather close .
look out , look out , it' s charlie !
look for that bloody exit .
we can' t go round here all night .
manzo ?
yes , sir .
check the station .
all trains .
check all names of passengers who boarded planes at linate or malpensa .
this was a big operation .
those engaged in the earlier part will probably have left by air .
check the autostradas .
the police will do this .
we know them , the police don' t .
get my plane ready .
they can' t get out in this mess .
if they planned this jam , they planned a way out .
i think you might try to keep up .
alright !
here , make a wish .
they' re behind us .
