i can' t hold her much longer .
she' s taking on too much water .
what is going on back there ?
keep your pants on , murphy .
we blew the starboard engine .
port engine' s way too hot .
hold on .
shorten the tow or cut her loose .
epps ... ... get off my damn tugboat .
we don' t have much time .
move it , epps .
if she sinks , she' s taking us with her .
got a punch in the port floater .
five minutes before she floods .
less than that !
get back here .
we' re cutting her loose .
cut her loose .
that' s it .
get back here .
come on !
you heard the man !
took us three months to get her off the bottom .
i will not lose her now !
goddamn it , epps !
you can' t fix everything !
christ !
for the last time , get back here !
she' s taking on too much water !
why do you always have to break my balls ?
i said get back here !
do you want me to come down there and kick your ass ?
because i' il do it .
here' s to the best damn salvage crew in the business !
we did it , guys !
yeah , look at that !
all right .
nice work .
here' s to the fucking sea !
to the sea .
to a job well done .
mr. murphy ?
i' m jack ferriman .
i was wondering if i could buy you a drink .
he doesn' t drink .
could i talk to you alone ?
you talk to me , you talk to my crew .
that' s the way it is .
i fly the arctic weather patrol flights out of mackenzie bay .
last month i was out in the middle of the strait when i came across this .
congratulations .
you found a boat .
in the middle of the ocean , of all places .
i tried for radio contact and got nothing ... ... so i figured she had to be adrift .
in the bering strait ?
that' s miles from shipping lanes .
did you alert the coast guard ?
it' s international waters , so they noted it and that' s it .
you get a name ?
no , i put it out of my head until two days ago when i saw it again .
what are we talking about ?
what kind of tonnage ?
big .
huge .
could be military .
let' s say that we' re a little bit interested .
what' s in it for you ?
i want 20 % finder' s fee , whatever she' s worth .
have you told anyone else about this ?
not a living soul .
give us a minute , will you ?
okay .
so ?
what do you think , murph ?
who knows ?
could be full of shit .
i do know one thing .
i' ve seen strange things happen in the strait .
sea gives you an opportunity , take it .
that' s at least a week out of our way .
we' ve been out for six months already .
i got a fiance waiting , remember ?
i' m getting married in a month .
plan was to go back to anchorage .
starboard diesel needs an overhaul .
there is no plan .
if you don' t want to go , that' s fine .
let' s tell him we' il get somebody else .
wait a minute .
let' s not be hasty .
what' s a ship like that worth ?
who knows ?
millions ?
thousands ?
could be nothing .
depends on a lot of things .
mainly , if we have the right to salvage .
pretty big " if .
what' s the split ?
we split it even , six ways .
even split ?
beats me paying you overtime .
i' m good .
i' m in .
greer ?
what do you say ?
all right .
hey , ferriman !
can you come over here ?
so this is the way it works .
10 % instead of your 20 % finder' s fee .
i can' t let you take advantage of me like that .
that' s the way it is .
take it or leave it .
fine .
but i go with you .
not on my boat , you don' t .
think i' d tell you where a fortune might be without insurance ?
there are five other boats that would jump at this .
i come with you .
so you take it or leave it .
things are dull !
she' il love it .
what do you think ?
too much off the sides , but i can come up with something she' il love .
shave that yourself .
don' t want to help me out ?
who the fuck are you kidding ?
everybody knows you navy boys take it up the ass .
enjoying the ride , jack ?
no , sir .
not the same as flying planes over ice sheets , is it ?
what' s the appeal ?
i could ask you the same thing .
what' s a nice girl doing in a dump like this instead of raising a family ?
i own a third of murphy' s operation .
i' m not that nice .
and these monkeys are my family .
santos to murphy .
come in .
yeah ?
i think you should get up here .
what is it ?
i think you should see this !
it was there a second ago !
ten miles to the northwest .
would you turn off that fucking music ?
i' m telling you , there must be a glitch .
i saw it with my own eyes .
glitch , my ass .
there' s nothing there .
give me a look at this .
there it is !
right in front of you !
tell me you don' t see nothing .
do you see what i' m saying ?
do you see what i' m saying to you ?
dodge , could you get on the bow light ?
all right , murph .
it' s there , right ?
there' s something there .
hey , murph , what' s up ?
vessel at position 7 5 north ... ... this is arctic warrior .
come in .
this is tugboat arctic warrior .
do you read me ?
this is arctic warrior .
do you read me ?
come in .
shit !
now do you believe me ?
holy shit !
an ocean liner ?
where did that come from ?
it' s the antonia graza .
jesus christ .
this is civilian tugboat arctic warrior .
is there anyone aboard ?
this is civilian tugboat arctic warrior .
is there anyone aboard ?
this is arctic warrior .
can you read us ?
you know her , murphy ?
only in my dreams .
christ , she' s beautiful .
italian liners couldn' t compete for speed , so they built floating art palaces instead .
she was reported missing may 21 , 1962 , off the coast of labrador .
funny thing is , there was no distress signal .
she just disappeared .
ever since , every captain' s been looking for her , hoping she hasn' t gone down .
do you know what this means ?
what ?
under the law of the sea , she' s ours .
let' s not keep a lady waiting .
santos , bring us alongside .
fire up the crane .
we got business to do .
when we get onboard , stay together .
we don' t know what kind of shape she' s in .
take us up , greer .
aye , aye , captain .
hey , murphy , please remember to keep all channels open .
thank you .
they won' t let me go .
safety first .
that' s why you go last , jack .
can you sit down ?
i' m trying to keep this steady .
i just want ...
sit down !
get out of the way !
okay .
she' s had some battering over the last 40 years , you can tell .
stand by .
setting you down topside .
she' s still a beaut .
unbelievable .
you better stay alert .
watch your step .
40 years of rust can turn deck plates into quicksand .
we' il make our way in at the fore , then check the bridge .
this way .
careful .
forward mast is history .
epps and murphy , are they a couple ?
hell , no .
she' s like a daughter to him .
he' d be lost without her .
superstructure' s in decent shape .
no sign of damage .
lifeboats are gone , stern to bow .
life preserver lockers are all empty .
sure no survivors ever turned up , murph ?
sure as we' re walking on the graza , dodge .
this way .
let' s go .
jesus .
she' s no fiddler' s green .
you' re wrong , munder .
she' s beautiful .
whoever was on here originally sure left in a hurry .
murphy , come in .
ladies and gentlemen , welcome aboard .
i' m julie .
i' il be your hostess this evening .
have some respect , okay ?
check out all those champagne bottles .
looks like we missed one hell of a party .
and one hell of a hangover .
shut up !
shut up !
let' s find the bridge .
such a manly man .
what ?
you all right ?
shut up !
come on , mary , let' s go .
murph , how many passengers did she carry ?
over 600 .
the crme de la crme of society from all over europe .
crew of 500 from italy .
talk to me .
how' s everything going ?
okay , good .
this companionway should get us to the bridge .
here , epps , hold this .
what' s going on ?
after you .
no , after you .
no , no .
after me .
tough guy .
don' t let go !
pull !
pull !
please , epps !
please , epps , don' t let go !
give me your hand .
pull us up !
oh , god !
i told you to watch your fucking step !
oh , shit .
oh , jesus .
from now on , you let me lead .
okay ?
let' s go .
i think i just shit my pants .
no , you always smell that way .
compass is dead .
helm' s not responding , either .
fuel tanks are empty .
she must' ve rode on full throttle till she was bone dry .
epps !
i' m looking for the ship' s log .
let' s get this documentation back ...
are you okay ?
yeah .
you sure ?
yeah .
let' s get to it .
hey , check this out .
it' s a watch .
congratulations , buddy .
no .
look again , you moron .
it' s a digital watch .
do the math .
they didn' t have digital watches in 1962 .
so we' re not the first people to board this ship .
but she' s ours now .
let' s get some sleep , tow her at dawn .
let' s hope there' s no more surprises .
amen to that .
oh , god .
epps , can i get some tea ?
any sign of what might' ve happened ?
how she got here ?
that' s the $64 million question , isn' t it ?
ever hear of a ship called the marie celeste ?
twin masted brigantine out of charleston during the civil war .
she was bound for london with a cargo of cotton .
thanks .
two months after she set sail , she was sighted by fishermen off tripoli .
she was doing 12 knots an hour in a stiff breeze .
something wasn' t quite right .
they didn' t know what so they went onboard .
you know what they found ?
nothing .
no passengers .
no crew .
no captain .
no sign of distress .
59 days after the last log entry , it had traveled 4500 miles across the ocean ... ... past the rock of gibraltar and into the mediterranean sea at full sail .
and nobody at the helm .
what do you make of that ?
a ghost ship .
hey , you smell that ?
i smell bullshit .
been on the sea a lot longer than you .
i know .
seen things that you can' t even imagine .
maritime history is full of marie celestes .
so , what' s our plan ?
i think we should do what we came to do .
tie her up , tug her in .
you think our little tug will pull this entire ocean liner ?
not with the problems we got .
we could set her at anchor and come back with two or three tugs .
no , some russian trawler will come along .
i' ve already looked for her anchors , anyway .
they' re gone .
what do you think ?
get the engines working ... ... it could take us two weeks minimum to tow a vessel this size .
for my share of what she' s worth , i' d drag her back to anchorage myself .
don' t let go !
help me !
don' t let go !
thought you might want a jacket .
thanks .
boy , do i miss that .
you okay ?
you seem quiet since you came back .
i think i saw something i couldn' t possibly have seen .
like what ?
no , it' s crazy .
i' m curious .
tell me .
i think i saw a little girl .
on ...
on the ...
the boat ?
yeah .
looking right at me .
and then what happened ?
nothing .
she disappeared .
sometimes , when i' d be flying for hours on end ... ... i' d think i' d see stuff too .
it' d be there one second and gone the next .
like a dream .
thanks .
see you in the a . m .
okay .
good night .
see you tomorrow .
yeah .
she' s got a big hole .
she' s sinking .
this is where the damage is .
see ?
breach in the hull , about 10 by 20 ... ... torn to the port collision bulkhead .
did it hit an iceberg ?
no , you don' t need an iceberg to rupture a hull .
she' s been hit recently .
about a week ago , i' d say .
this is where we are .
the problem' s this group of islands .
nothing spectacular ... ... just rocks , a couple thousand seals .
the antonia graza' s caught here in this strong current loop ... ... and slowly she' s been pushed towards those rocks .
last time she hit them .
what about next time ?
won' t be one .
we' ve got three days to fix it .
that' s if the weather holds .
why can' t we tow it like it is ?
it' d be like towing a car with four flat tires .
it' s a bump in the road .
we can fix it .
murph , bump in the road ?
the breach we can probably patch if we can get to the inside .
we' il weld shut the flooded compartments , pump out the water up to the aft peak .
on top of that , the rudder' s jammed .
we jerry rig it , set a 38 degree current drift to clear the island chain .
what does all that mean ?
i just ...
that' s a lot of work for three days .
but with the gear we' ve got onboard and what' s on that ship , we can try .
we can do it , right ?
with the gear we' ve got onboard , i can' t fix our engine .
quit bitching and overhaul the starboard engine .
so that' s the plan ?
just do it .
i' il call it in .
i wouldn' t do that if i were you .
maritime law states ...
i know .
we just don' t want any unexpected guests .
just leave it .
your call , captain .
all right , you know the drill .
we do a complete recon .
make sure we' ve got no problems before we get to work .
stay with me , greer .
don' t wander .
okay .
dodge , munder , go to the port collision bulkhead .
jack and i' il work back from the fore .
call if you need anything .
how about a pizza ?
you' re so funny .
the only plan in this business is that there is no plan .
what is that ?
what these people talking crazy for ?
that' s not even good english .
hang in there , okay , preciosa ?
because someday he' il find some other genius to fix his boat .
you want to play like that ?
it' s still sweet , though .
light coming up .
you were right .
she is beautiful .
she sure is .
epps , we' re heading for the main engine room .
epps ?
all right , capitano .
oh , shit .
we' re gonna have to dive to get to that tear .
epps , the engine room is totally flooded .
epps , can you hear me ?
wait !
what happened ?
you okay ?
what are you doing down there ?
did you hurt yourself ?
what are you doing ?
the whole bottom' s riddled with them .
looks like someone used it for target practice .
that' s the happy version .
what' s the not so happy version ?
there were people in there .
i saw that little girl again .
what ?
where ?
i must be losing my goddamn mind .
well , did she say anything ?
forget it .
come on .
murphy , come in .
dodge !
anybody !
shit .
i think she' s fucking with us .
looks like central laundry .
this vent connects to the forward hold .
we need to see if it' s flooded .
i may need help shutting it .
you sure we need to ... ?
murphy , where the hell are you ?
how long have they been here ?
a month , maybe less .
what are we gonna do ?
get off this boat !
but the ship ...
if it sinks , it sinks .
you' re right .
stinks .
what the hell ?
we came through there .
no shit !
come on !
this way .
come on , jack .
what the ... ?
when' d you start wearing lipstick , epps ?
epps ?
francesca .
nice titties .
not that you can hold a candle to the future mrs. greer , though .
come on , jack .
stop dragging ass !
what' s your problem ?
what' s this ?
forget it .
let' s go !
jack !
' 58 jaguar x150 .
i' ve dreamt about this car since i was a kid .
we have to get out of here now .
do you understand ?
now .
there' s something moving in there .
fuck !
oh , my god !
i hate rats !
what ?
oh , my god !
look at this !
i have to get murphy .
murphy !
is someone trying to call me ?
dodge !
munder !
maureen ...
who' s maureen ?
it' s my first name .
it' s cold ...
he said " cold " ?
the galley .
it' s cold .
please help us .
don' t go in there .
you fucking assholes !
fuck you !
take it easy !
you were fucking with us .
we fucked with you .
why aren' t you laughing ?
wanna hear something funnier ?
we found dead guys in the laundry room .
and this in the cargo hold .
need some help , skipper ?
i' m sorry .
jesus .
oh , man .
holy shit !
yeah !
we' re rich !
you son of a bitch !
rich !
come on .
let' s go .
move this shit out !
one .
two .
three ...
how much you figure it' s worth , boss ?
there' s a lot of gold .
hard to know .
two , 300 million , maybe .
maybe more .
jesus .
i don' t know .
lock boxes with half of fort knox in them ?
they gotta be insured .
no way somebody will let this much gold float away .
well , the markings have been filed down .
what does that mean ?
someone didn' t want this traceable .
it' s stolen .
it may have to do with the reason this ship disappeared when it did .
wait .
if the gold' s got something to do with 1962 ... ... what about the bodies ?
they can' t be more than three weeks old .
somebody' s gotta say it , and it might as well be me .
this ship is fucked up .
earlier i could swear i heard a woman singing .
it' s like she was ...
like she was coming on to me .
oh , no !
it was the sexiest voice i ever heard , man .
she got any backup singers ?
whatever you' re on , get me some !
maybe you' re not quite ready to get married , greer .
fuck you .
okay , guys .
what about the coast guard ?
no .
you call the coast guard ...
what if the gold did turn out to be stolen ?
under maritime law , anything found in international waters ... ... belongs to the finder .
okay ?
that is the law .
right .
finders keepers .
if we' re gonna do this , i say we do it now .
get our boat going , grab the gold and get the hell out of here .
we leave the boat , take the gold .
who' s with me ?
i' m with the gold , man .
gold .
the gold .
epps ?
i just want to get off this boat .
okay .
let' s go to work .
okay .
warrior is in position , murph .
can we please get the hell out of here ?
yeah , preciosa !
smell that money !
100 million .
you hear what i' m saying ?
100 million !
greer ?
get those engines going .
i' m bringing the gold down .
yes , sir , captain , sir .
hey , santos .
hurry your ass up , vato .
we got to go like this .
i wanna see these gauges rocking , because you just had an overhaul .
and you , i want you to give me some too .
let' s do this !
hey , yo , greer !
fire it up !
we' re going to haul ass .
bring it on !
we' il be so fucking rich !
stop !
stop !
you don' t know what you' re doing !
we' re good to go , skipper .
don' t start the boats !
he' il ...
shit !
greer !
greer !
what the hell just happened ?
jesus christ !
fire on deck !
santos !
greer !
munder !
i got you .
epps !
i got munder !
greer !
come on !
santos !
santos , answer me !
i don' t know what happened .
the engine room just blew .
maybe santos rushed the engines , didn' t seal up the gaskets right ...
jack , did you find anything out about this ship before you sent us out here ?
no , but i ...
look , we' ve got the gold , and we are still alive .
tell that to santos , asshole !
ease up !
this is bullshit !
santos came here out of free will ... ... just like us .
what does that mean ?
enough !
santos is dead because of you !
come on !
it' s not gonna bring him back .
murph , it' s not your fault .
you know that .
how is he ?
here' s the plan .
we' re professional salvers with a fortune onboard .
i say we do what we do best : fix this rust bucket .
control her drift .
clear those islands .
we can survive long enough to get picked up .
why is this a question ?
we have the materials .
why don' t we build a raft and leave ?
there is something wrong with this boat !
if we stay here , we may not survive .
you want to build a raft ?
i want to build a raft .
even with the warrior ... ... we were stretching to do this in three days .
we can' t do this .
you' re the best spot welder i know .
we can do it right now , but i need you .
fine .
but there' s no way we' re doing a major patch and pump in the dark .
even with the lights we have , it' d be like going in blind .
okay , fine .
we' il chill tonight and go in the a . m .
greer ?
what do you say ?
now you want to know what the first mate has to say ?
i say go to hell , epps .
you' re not qualified to get us off this ship .
had murphy let me do it my way , we wouldn' t be in this .
and the coast guard ...
so it' s everybody else' s fault , right ?
they' d be here and we' d be on our way home , millionaires .
that' s bullshit .
grow up , asshole .
fucking bitch !
keep fucking talking .
say another word !
say another word !
here it is .
katie .
b deck .
you were alone .
100 to 1 , somebody poisoned the passengers to get the gold .
okay , sherlock , if they were poisoned , why are these cans safe ?
they' re still sealed .
it' s been sealed for 40 years .
it' s safe .
okay , shoot for it .
loser goes first .
paper beats rock .
come on , man , best of three .
bullshit .
you lost .
where' s your empathy ?
winners do not empathize with losers .
bon appetite .
i screwed up .
i should' ve called it in .
damn !
i knew better !
i' il make it home to you , baby .
i swear .
what the hell are you looking at ?
that' s all right .
no way .
no , really .
it' s good .
look , i' m not kidding .
are you serious ?
i' m serious .
it' s good !
you gotta try that !
that' s good !
that' s great !
katie ?
katie ?
can i tell you something else ?
we get back ... ... i' m gonna take my money and i' m gonna buy you a bathtub .
i' il get you a lifetime supply of titty magazines and toilet paper !
i already beat you to it , bro !
there' s something on your ...
katie ?
who , me ?
francesca , i know all of this isn' t real .
so i' m just gonna go with it , okay ?
can' t cheat on your fiance with a dead girl , right ?
her parents .
please .
don' t close it .
haven' t seen them for years .
they moved to new york .
i was on my way to join them .
but they' re dead now .
how would you know ?
when you' re like this ... ... you know these things .
my mother ... ... she made me this dress .
do you like it ?
you remind me of her .
i don' t think so .
well , here .
you should have this back .
oh , god , you really are a fucking ghost .
where are you going ?
santos was my goddamn responsibility .
the lorelei .
she was adrift .
we rescued her .
i' ve heard the story of the lorelei .
i didn' t know the graza was involved .
the gold was onboard the lorelei ?
it says here " may 19 , 1962 .
that' s two days before your ship disappeared .
there were no survivors onboard the lorelei .
jesus christ !
where you going ?
most spirits are free to be with their families .
so why aren' t you with yours ?
we' re all trapped here .
who ?
my shipmates and i.
even the ones who aren' t marked .
marked ?
katie , what do you mean ?
when the boat' s full ...
what ?
you can tell me .
when he has all the souls he needs and has filled his quota ... ... we' il all be ferried ... ... to ...
what is it ?
what' s wrong ?
what is it ?
he doesn' t want me talking to you .
he who ?
but i' m not like the others !
you need to tell me .
you must go at once .
leave the ship while you still can !
katie , what is it ?
katie !
katie ?
epps ?
come on !
we have to leave .
where you going , murphy ?
what' s the matter ?
it' s me .
santos .
it' s no fun lying at the bottom of the ocean .
no lights at the end of the tunnel .
not for me , murph .
no 10, 000 virgins at the pearly gates .
because of the plan , i' m trapped on this dreamboat of yours .
so you know what ?
you' re coming along for the ride .
no !
murphy ?
you all right , murph ?
you okay ?
what' s the matter , murph ?
it' s me !
it' s me !
do it , come on .
it' il make you feel good .
come on !
come on !
hey !
oh , god .
epps , you okay ?
keep him in the aquarium .
no , listen .
he was drunk .
he didn' t know what he was doing .
look , he just tried to kill you .
he stays in there .
let' s go find greer .
any sign of him ?
no , we looked all over .
man' s pissed off .
seems to happen on this boat .
least we weren' t around 40 years ago .
the passengers were poisoned ... ... to get to the gold ?
isn' t that ... ?
extreme ?
maybe , but if the shoe fits ...
next thing you know , we' il be trying to kill each other .
what' s with the heart ?
found it .
belonged to this little girl .
what girl ?
she told me to get off this boat .
she' s talking to you now ?
what are you talking about ?
you' re seeing ghosts , epps ?
just forget it .
so the ship' s got a few kinks .
let' s stick with munder' s specs and try to fix the ship .
no way five people and the gold will fit on any raft .
murphy' s not going anywhere , and we' re not leaving him here .
we stick with the plan .
fix the boat .
let' s get going .
come on .
that' s the collision bulkhead hatch .
wheel' s busted .
it won' t open .
arming the c4 .
dodge ?
i' m good .
munder ?
i' m good .
contact .
there' s the tear , portside .
looks bigger from here .
i' il shut her up , no problem .
munder , rudder' s fixed .
you all right ?
i' m good .
what do you think , dodge ?
she' il hold .
we' re set with the pumps .
start them up .
copy that , epps .
one and two , kicking in .
i give it 12 hours till she' s bone dry .
both on full .
get ready , epps .
here it comes .
great work , guys .
damn .
current' s faster than i thought .
if we control her drift , headed in this direction , we should clear those islands .
we' il keep it afloat until we get picked up .
son of a bitch .
we may just get out of this yet .
kazillionaires .
check on the bridge when you' re done here .
i' il see if i can find greer down below .
greer ?
katie ?
greer ?
jesus !

number two' s clogged .
who' s going ?

shit .
every single time !
oh , my god .
come with me .
i want to show you something .
no !
come on !
no !
come on !
you can' t die on me !
dodge .
murphy' s dead .
what ?
we have to get off this boat .
there' s a reason you , me and munder are still alive .
that' s why he came after us .
to fix his ship .
i just saw murphy .
what' s happening ?
i don' t know .
i want you and dodge on the rudder .
but you just said ...
listen to me .
i' il get munder , we' il see if the welds are holding .
stay here till we get back .
i do not want you out of each other' s sight .
take this .
take it .
be careful down there .
i will .
that' s it , then .
we made it .
for now .
i' il check on epps .
no , she said to wait here .
yeah , but ...
hey , she said to wait !
so wait .
you disgust me .
what did you say ?
you heard me .
you' re a pathetic excuse for a man .
she says , " jump , " and you jump .
you' re disgusting .
i don' t have time for this .
who the hell are you ?
the question is , who are you ?
you worship her , yet you' ve never had the balls to tell her ... ... because you' re a weak , cowardly child .
however , if you' il kindly step out of my way , i' il make your dream a reality .
you know , dodge , if you kill somebody , you go to hell .
well , you live for her .
you willing to die for her ?
i shot ferriman .
he' s dead .
yeah ?
don' t be so sure , dodge .
what are you doing ?
trip' s over .
i' m sinking the boat .
it' s taken its last victim .
that' il kill us .
we' il have to take our chances .
what about the gold ?
fucking kidding ?
we' re not getting the gold off this boat .
nobody ever does .
wait , wait .
wait !
that gold can give us everything we ever wanted .
we could have our own boat .
the two of us .
we could have a life together .
you and me .
what are you talking about ?
dodge , we gotta get out of here .
now .
well , i can' t let you do that .
so that' s it , huh ?
all right .
okay .
you win .
all right .
fucking bitch !
all right , you win !
go ahead , do it !
go ahead .
blow it up !
kill us all !
hey , dodge .
why haven' t you asked me where munder is ?
well , i suppose that' s because ... ... i already know .
you won' t pull that trigger , maureen .
try me .
dodge made the same mistake .
he' s dead .
katie told you , didn' t she ?
souls without sin can' t be marked .
makes them tough to control .
but as long as i keep the boat afloat , we' il all go down together .
what the fuck are you ?
i' m a salvager .
just like you .
you collect ships , i collect souls .
and when i fill my quota , i send a boatload home .
this will make management happy .
you see , it' s a job .
given to me after a lifetime of sin .
so if i lose this ship , management won' t be happy , which is not a good thing .
i' m not getting through to you .
i' m asking for an exchange .
this ship for your life .
i want my crew back .
sorry .
once a passenger' s marked , they' re mine .
then i guess it' s over .
all you had to do was fix the ship !
i gave you a great opportunity .
all you had to do was take it .
what are you gonna do , shoot me ?
careful .
hang in there , ma' am .
no !
