well ?
nothing .
where was it ?
in a plastic bag , on the porch .
what' s wrong ?
he must have been there , no ?
come inside .
tomorrow , i' il ask the rochants and beaufays if they saw anything .
he must have been there for a while .
i already called antoine .
he saw nothing .
i got marie' s answering machine .
the tape runs for over 2 hours .
when did you leave ?
i don' t know .
not long after you .
around 8 : 45 .
franois called to ...
there !
give it here .
how did i manage to miss this guy ?
i can' t figure it out .
maybe the camera was in a car .
it doesn' t look filmed through a window
someplace on that house maybe ?
it' s dumb .
i don' t know what to say .
can you think of someone who might do this as a prank ?
we should eat before it' s totally ruined .
maybe a friend of pierrot' s .
some idiot playing games with his pal' s unhip parents .
no ?
i doubt it .
it' s not really funny .
that' s for sure .
where is he anyway ?
who ?
pierrot no idea .
he' il be home soon .
was it in there ?
what ?
the tape .
no , in a supermarket bag .
where is it ?
i have no idea .
in the living room , or the den , or out in the hall .
who cares ?
there was nothing inside ?
no note or anything ?
no , but nothing' s stopping you from checking for yourself .
can you bring the salad ?
nothing fancy tonight .
that the bag it was in ?
yes .
what , you think i' m an idiot ?
you could have missed something .
you should eject the tape .
maybe i missed a label or something .
look , i' m only trying to ...
ah , the sonny boy is here .
better late than never .
hi there .
hi .
sit down , pierrot .
i' il bring you a plate .
where were you ?
at yves ' .
why ?
why ?
i want to know .
do i need a reason ?
evening , pierrot .
evening , mom .
well ?
on tuesdays , i go to yves ' .
wednesdays , we have geometry and he helps with my homework .
maybe it' s one of your fans .
pierrot , don' t breathe in the breakout .
andr , same for you .
don' t breathe in the breakout .
what ?
hold your breath in the breakout .
thomas , think about your kick .
pierrot , too shallow on the turn .
more depth .
andr , that' s good , but you went too deep .
too much depth .
thomas , watch your breathing .
see you again in two weeks for another round table .
until then , good reading and thanks to the new viewers tuning in every week .
goodnight .
stay seated while the credits roll , please !
thank you everybody !
the tape was wrapped in it .
what is it ?
what' s going on ?
georges ?
what ?
nothing ...
nothing , i ...
i' m tired .
what do we do now ?
meaning ?
you want to call the police ?
yes ...
no ...
i don' t know .
let me see the drawing again .
maybe we should report it now .
it looks like a child' s drawing .
no idea .
i can' t tell .
should i ask pierrot ?
no , what' s the use ?
you really think one of his friends would stay out all night to spy on us ?
that would be stupid .
why did you stop it ?
why not ?
what more do you want to see ?
it' s dumb but i' m scared .
did you talk to pierrot about it ?
no , do you think we should ?
i don' t know .
i no longer buy the schoolboy prank theory .
what then ?
what ?
what ?
i haven' t a clue .
hello ?
mme laurent yes .
hi , this is manu .
is georges there ?
you just missed him by a couple of minutes .
sorry .
l wanted to remind him about the beaumont file .
he took it .
i saw him .
great , thank you .
have a good day .
bye , manu .
yes ?
l' d like to speak to georges laurent .
who' s asking ?
i' d like to speak to georges laurent .
who are you ?
what do you want ?
l' d like to speak to the man by the name of georges laurent .
hello .
hi .
i just spoke to your wife ... ... she wants you to call her back .
ok , thank you .
what' s this card ?
it came in the mail .
what' s wrong with you , dickhead ?
what ?
can' t you be more careful , idiot ?
forget it .
say that again .
what ?
repeat what you just said .
don' t you have eyes in your head ?
i must be dreaming .
which moron stepped out without looking ?
but who' s going the wrong way down a one way street ?
yell at me again .
come on , yell at me again .
ok , let' s not fight about this .
you weren' t looking .
and we weren' t looking , ok ?
you' d better keep your big mouth shut .
i' m sorry .
in any case ...
we know we' re not getting any help .
as long as he doesn' t torch the house or send us bombs instead of tapes ... ... we' re in good shape .
please , georges .
hi , dad .
hi , pierrot .
what' s going on ?
what do you mean ?
why are you picking me up ?
i had some free time .
i thought you' d like it .
i see .
no , i dropped mom at work and i wanted us to talk .
why ?
where was she ?
we had stuff to do .
that' s why i wanted to talk to you , too .
i see .
what' s with that card you sent ?
what card ?
this one .
the teacher gave it to me at lunch .
she didn' t get the weird drawing , but found it odd you' d send cards to school .
sitting all the way in the back next to the mirror , you know .
never keep a lady waiting , especially an elderly lady .
so i go over , introduce myself ... ... and ask why she wants to see me .
she apologizes for summoning me like that .
she offers me a seat .
she seems very emotional .
so i sit next to her .
she says she' s never been here before , and isn' t in the habit of accosting strangers .
but i strongly remind her of someone , and she couldn' t help herself .
it was someone she had loved very much .
what could i do ?
she was in her 70s .
it was touching , her hands trembled .
anyway ...
you know i' m not the sentimental type .
not really .
but she really got to me .
so i' m eagerly waiting to hear about this guy i remind her of so much .
who do you think it was ?
her lover ?
father ?
husband ?
it was her dog .
exactly .
what would you have done ?
excellent , you' ve had your fun .
and i turn to leave .
straight faced , she begs me to me sit down .
she says she knows it all sounds ridiculous , but i must stay a bit longer , and hear her story out .
she would never dare to make fun of me .
it was weird , but she seemed so desperate ...
i sat back down .
and she begins her story .
how her dog died in a traffic accident in ' 64 .
that' s funny , i say ...
i was born in ' 64 .
she seemed offended that i wasn' t taking her seriously .
she looked at me sadly and said , " he was run over by a van ... ... on april 17 , 1964 , as we were about to cross the street .
april 17 ...
it' s my birthday .
no way !
that' s exactly what i said .
so she fills me in on the details .
she stepped out with her dog , but a high vehicle hid the van , which ran over the dog .
the bumper hit its neck .
the wound was deep .
the dog died soon after .
you won' t believe this ...
give me your hand .
i have a scar in the exact same spot .
come on , is it true or not ?
not bad .
where did you hear that one ?
you don' t believe me ?
you know frdric called me ?
simone' s better .
the operation was last week .
we' ve hardly been to see her recently .
to be honest , we were never very close .
she was always so distant .
it' s hard to develop a bond .
and frdric ?
he' s writing a screenplay .
about that ?
no , but maubert bought it .
where' s her daughter while she' s in the hospital ?
with him and his girlfriend .
what' s she like ?
nice .
it' s tough when friends break up , and you have to take sides .
frdric' s changed a lot .
he' s more outgoing since he met marianne .
her name is marianne ?
yes .
what' s the screenplay about ?
what screenplay ?
isn' t frdric writing one ?
oh , yeah ...
i have no idea .
expecting anyone else ?
no .
i' il go see .
who can it be at this time ?
no idea .
one of his fans no doubt .
the price of fame .
groupies all over you ...
who' s there ?
who' s there ?
what' s this all about ?
show yourself , coward !
show yourself and say what you want !
pathetic !
... apparently , it plays through the 15th ...
well ?
nothing .
nothing ?
there was nobody .
there was nobody outside .
ok then ...
you' re spoiling us .
i' il have to diet for 3 weeks .
why were you out there so long ?
it' s ok .
everything' s ok .
there' s no problem .
i' m not some jealous wife who suspects hubby' s cheating on her .
thank you .
sorry .
i' m a bit on edge because in the last few days we' ve been getting anonymous parcels and phone calls .
i jump every time the doorbell rings , and i think it' s our asshole stalker .
what kind of calls ?
i don' t know how ... to describe them .
you' ve been to the police ?
of course .
and ?
and nothing .
they' il only move when we' re attacked .
it' s outrageous !
it' s a fact .
dig in before it gets cold .
so what was it ?
what' s up with him ?
since anne has decided to share our good news with you ,
i won' t hide anything .
are you happy now ?
it' s not very entertaining .
we receive shots of our house , apparently to show us we' re under surveillance .
with all of anne' s comings and goings , mine and pierrot' s ...
you' ve no idea who' s filming and how ?
so far , no .
let' s see .
here you go .
what' s that ?
the house where i grew up .
do you need anything else ?
no , run along .
very well .
goodnight .
don' t just stand there .
sit down .
no need to look so gloomy .
she' s there just in case , that' s all .
i' m sorry .
what for ?
i didn' t know ...
stop that .
you' re being ridiculous .
tell me how you' re doing .
fine .
i' m fine ...
since we spoke on the phone , nothing' s changed .
pierrot' s battling puberty .
anne' s busy at her publisher' s
and me with the tv program .
that' s about it .
aunt julie wrote me a letter .
from marseille .
she never misses your show on tv .
she says she envies me having a son like you .
that' s nice .
she' il hit 80 this year .
really ?
what' s wrong ?
you look all pent up .
what is it ?
nothing , i' m fine .
i don' t enjoy seeing you so unwell .
what do you mean , " unwell ?
for my age , i' m very well !
don' t bother me with nonsense like that .
isn' t it lonely , if you can' t go out ?
why ?
are you less lonely because you can sit in the garden ?
do you feel less lonely in the metro than at home ?
well then !
anyway , i have my family friend ...
with remote control .
whenever they annoy me , i just shut them up .
i miss not hearing the piano .
ever since your dad died .
do you still play ?
no .
i don' t have time , you know .
pity .
yes .
and pierrot , is he gifted ?
he' s not interested .
he prefers to hang out .
he' s 12 now , isn' t he ?
what brings you down here ?
i' m going to aix for a special on franois weyergans .
he' s publishing a new novel , his first in ages .
really ?
you know who i had a dream about ?
majid
who' s majid ?
you know !
majid !
you' ve lost me .
majid !
hashem' s son .
the kid you planned to adopt !
i see .
odd , isn' t it ?
what' s odd ?
after all those years .
it' s not all that odd .
i often dream of my childhood .
it comes with age .
sure , but i' m not that old .
it comes faster than you think .
do you ever think about him ?
about whom ?
majid .
no .
how come ?
how come ?
how come you don' t think about him ever ?
it was a big deal for you and dad at the time .
it was a long time ago .
and it' s not a happy memory .
as you know only too well .
yeah .
what did you dream ?
stupid stuff , but it brought him back to mind .
i' d forgotten all about him .
what does anne do ?
she' s well .
she still works for the same publishers .
she runs her own schedule .
her boss is a friend of ours .
very handy .
yes .
i don' t know what more i can tell you .
we hardly see each other and when we do , i' ve nothing special to tell you .
mostly , we chug along .
no great highs or lows .
i' m fine .
anne' s fine .
pierrot' s fine .
as far as i can tell , at least .
we' re all very busy and that' s about it .
but i get the feeling you' re not fine .
you seem strange , georges .
listening to you , i' m worried about you .
what' s going on ?
what do you mean ?
come on ...
no , seriously ?
when are you leaving ?
tomorrow morning .
i have to be in aix by 12 .
you' il have to leave early then .
yes .
shall i ask mme arnaud to prepare breakfast for us ?
you' re up that early ?
i don' t sleep much now .
that' s one of the benefits of old age .
i' m off to bed .
i' m dead tired .
goodnight .
can i get you something ?
you need anything ?
no , i' m fine .
i have all i need .
goodnight .
goodnight , mom .
what time for breakfast ?
7 o' clock ?
ok .
shall i tell her ?
yes .
goodnight .
light off ?
no .
he' s not a baby anymore .
i like not having him around some days .
he can be a little macho prick .
yes , i wonder who he gets it from .
when will you be home ?
can' t you pick him up at school ?
i can' t tomorrow .
we have to pack up here .
it was our last launch in this fancy location .
yes , there are a lot of people .
it' s swarming , in fact .
yes , i' il tell him .
love you too .
morning , mom .
there was a street sign .
i can' t make it out .
le ... ... nin , no ?
avenue lenin ?
yes , avenue lenin .
but where ?
do you have the map ?
hold on .
romain ...
romainville .
could be romainville .
see if there' s an avenue lenin .
hold on .
found it !
near mairie des lilas metro station .
line 11 .
right there .
so what are you going to do ?
go over there .
it' s near guillaume' s place .
and ?
nothing , i' il go over ... knock on the door , and see what happens ...
as simple as that ?
as simple as that .
got a better idea ?
why not the police ?
we got the hallway , the street .
you should go with a cop .
they can do that much , no ?
what if it' s a bluff , a practical joke ?
you think so ?
seriously ?
what does the tape show ?
a street and a low rent hallway .
they' il just tell me ...
try knocking on the door
and if someone tries to kill you come see us again .
who would know the house where you grew up ?
i don' t know .
do you recognize the building ?
no .
right , well ... we' il hire a private detective .
you watch too many crime shows .
you' re impossible to talk to .
do it your way .
i have a hunch .
what ?
i think i know who it is .
you know who it is ?
l think i know .
so ?
so i have to make sure .
whoa , what' s wrong with you ?
maybe you could share your solitary wisdom .
this concerns me too , you know ?
i can' t tell you because i don' t know .
it' s just a hunch .
you can' t tell me about it ?
non .
wow ...
i don' t know what i ...
do you realize what you' re saying ?
please , it' s not what you think .
and what do i think ?
will you cut it out ?
it' s a vague hunch .
i don' t want to alarm anyone before i know more .
it is not your concern .
it' s not my concern ?
i guess i dreamt it all !
i thought it was my concern being terrorized by anonymous calls and these fucking videos !
being almost too scared to go out !
not my concern to lie awake all night worrying about pierrot and you and all this crap ?
if it' s not my concern then it' s business as usual .
would you like something to eat ?
or maybe i can get you a drink ?
anne , please , if i had known ...
what would you have done ?
kept your trap shut ?
please ...
do you realize the bullshit you' re talking ?
you' ve never heard of trust ?
you realize you' re doing exactly what this guy wants ?
he wants to throw our lives upside down .
you' re reacting exactly as he wants .
can' t you just trust me ?
i have to trust you ?
why not the other way around for once ?
how about you trust me ?
who' s refusing to give trust here ?
imagine the shoe' s on the other foot .
imagine i say ...
i have an idea who' s terrorizing us but i can' t tell you .
great , no ?
that' s your idea of a working relationship
based on mutual trust ?
you should hear yourself .
just a second !
i' m coming !
sorry , i was in the middle of ...
look who it is !
who are you ?
you wanna come in ?
after you .
have a seat .
i was making lunch .
what do you want from me ?
what do i want ?
me ?
do you want money ?
money ?
what then ?
do you mind telling me how you found me ?
it' s a game , is that it ?
i don' t want to play .
i' ve grown up .
i see that .
so , what' s the point of your actions ?
what actions ?
are you making fun of me ?
do you mind telling me why you' re here ?
how did you find me ?
what' s this ?
don' t play dumb .
well ?
sit down , please .
you may not believe i wasn' t expecting you .
but it' s true .
you' re the last person i would expect at my door .
right .
i' il play along to see where it gets us .
i could also report you to the police quite simply .
so , you had no idea and you' re surprised to see me .
who do you think drew me here ?
who' s been terrorizing my family for weeks ?
i don' t know .
why do you talk like we' re strangers ?
you wouldn' t have recognized me , huh ?
out in the street , you' d have walked right past me .
at first , i wasn' t sure either .
when i tuned into your show by chance a few years ago ...
the show with the two chairs stuck together ...
you sat up close to your guests , face to face ...
i wasn' t sure either .
i just had a nasty feeling in my gut .
weird , no ?
i felt nauseous and i didn' t know why .
when your name finally came up , i began to understand .
and then ... the nose .
how did you wind up on tv ?
you didn' t take over the estate ?
tell me what you want .
nothing .
nothing .
what could i want from you ?
what do you imagine ?
money ?
you barge in here accusing me of trying to blackmail you .
you haven' t changed .
what could i blackmail you with ?
who sent me the tapes ?
the tapes ?
strange .
i haven' t gotten into a fight since i was a child .
i find it repugnant .
and right now ... if you don' t stop this stupid game ...
you' il kick my ass ?
that shouldn' t be hard .
you' re a lot bigger than the last time .
kicking my ass won' t leave you any wiser about me .
even if you beat me to death .
but you' re too refined for that .
above all , you have too much to lose .
what are you saying ?
that' s not true ?
i think it is .
what wouldn' t we do not to lose what' s ours ?
you were older and stronger than me .
i had no choice .
right , then .
your mom' s sick ?
where do you get that from ?
it' s not hard to guess , is it ?
what do you want ?
revenge ?
she was a very kind lady .
i was very grateful to her , you know .
to your father , too .
i' m going to leave now .
if you try again to interfere in my life , to scare my family or to hurt me in any way you' il regret it , i swear .
you' re threatening me ?
yes , i' m threatening you .
believe me , i mean it .
i believe you .
but you don' t believe me .
i didn' t want anything from you .
and i never sent you a tape or anything else .
not this either .
i' m glad you came .
yes , hello
this is georges laurent .
could i speak to my wife ?
thank you .
hi , it' s me .
i went there .
nobody was in .
no , it was just a door like any other .
it was locked .
i did .
he said it was unoccupied .
it must be a storeroom
she was a very kind lady .
l was very grateful to her , you know .
to your father , too .
l' m going to leave now , but you can be sure of something .
lf you try again to interfere in my life , to scare my family or to hurt me in any way , you' il regret it , i swear .
you' re threatening me ?
yes , i' m threatening you .
believe me , i mean it .
l believe you .
but you don' t believe me .
l didn' t want anything from you .
and i never sent you a tape or anything else .
not this either .
l' m glad you came .
that' s it .
the tape runs for another hour if you want to watch how he feels .
i' m sorry .
what for ?
what now ?
i know .
it was dumb of me to lie to you .
i apologize .
i don' t get it .
i' m sorry !
i don' t get how you see things .
you say " sorry " and just like that everything' s okay , right ?
am i supposed to beg ?
what did i do that' s so awful ?
i only lied to spare you more stress .
has the world stopped spinning ?
i' m sorry .
i suspected it was him .
not at first but after the tape of mom' s house .
i didn' t want you to deal with this .
his parents worked for us .
dad liked them .
they must have been good workers .
in october ' 61 , the fln called all algerians to a demonstration in paris .
october 17 , 1961 .
enough said .
papon .
the police massacre .
they drowned about 200 arabs in the seine including majid' s parents most likely .
they never came back .
dad went to paris to look for them .
they said he should be glad to be rid of a couple of jigaboos .
and then ?
and then ...
my parents decided to adopt the boy .
i don' t know why .
they felt responsible in some way .
so ...
it bothered me .
i didn' t want him in our house .
he had his own room .
i had to share , you see .
i was 6 !
so what did you do ?
nothing ...
i told lies about him .
you told lies about him ?
that' s all ?
that' s why he wants revenge ?
apparently .
you threatened him .
not a particularly intelligent move .
not particularly intelligent ?
stupid .
i know .
i was out of my depth .
i don' t think he' s lying .
what do you mean ?
he was genuinely surprised .
but the tape ?
which one ?
you think it' s staged ?
he' d have to be awfully cunning .
who else could it be ?
i can' t read his mind .
why send this thing to us ?
to keep me informed .
unlike you .
so who sent the other tapes ?
how should i know ?
what kind of lies did you tell ?
i can' t remember .
the usual stuff kids lie about .
things you make up .
stupid stuff .
well ?
well what ?
stop acting like an idiot !
if you' d accused him of stealing a teddy bear , he wouldn' t want revenge 40 years later .
i don' t remember !
you don' t want to tell me , you mean ?
ferchrissakes , what more do you want ! ?
i have no idea anymore .
do you remember stupid stuff you did when you were 6 ?
what happened to him ?
he was sent away .
he was sick .
to a hospital , or a children' s home , i don' t know .
one day he was gone , and i was glad .
and then i forgot all about it .
that' s natural , no ?
and your parents ?
forgot it too , i suppose .
it was only an interlude of a few months .
an interlude ?
what should i call it ?
a tragedy ?
maybe it was a tragedy .
i don' t know .
i don' t feel responsible for it .
why should i ?
it' s all so absurd .
you mentioned it to your mother when you visited ?
sure .
ah , i see there' s at least someone you trust .
jesus !
she knows about him already .
i didn' t mention the tapes .
well , what did she say ?
nothing .
she' s getting old .
she can' t remember .
or doesn' t want to .
i don' t know .
it' s unpleasant for her .
thanks for coming so quickly .
how is it going ?
great thanks .
and you ?
busy as always , you know what it' s like .
please , take a seat .
how' s your wife ?
i haven' t seen her for ages .
she' s very well .
they just published a translation of pereira' s book on globalization .
she fought for it , and it' s a bit hit .
great , i must buy it , but you know how it is .
one can never find the time .
please give her my regards .
of course .
thank you .
coffee ?
no , thanks .
i' ve already too much today .
i' il get right to it .
you probably think i asked you up to talk about the concept for your new show .
that' il have to wait .
the head of programming won' t decide anything before summer .
the decision was due by may 15 .
i know , but what can i say ?
the lord works in mysterious ways .
public tv even more so .
i wouldn' t worry .
we always bring them around , don' t we ?
may god hear you !
sadly , polytheism reigns here .
but as i said , don' t worry .
it' il all work out .
with your prestige and your loyal viewership !
yeah , sure .
anyway ...
i asked you up because of a silly thing that to be honest makes me a little uncomfortable .
yesterday , my secretary left a tape on my desk .
it was addressed to me but without a note .
usually , she wouldn' t even show me something like that .
she' d just take a quick look and toss it in the trash .
i' ve no interest in the crap your fan club sends in .
but she thought i should see this .
the tape shows you having a private conversation with a man in a kind of flat .
the subject isn' t apparent plus i didn' t want to be indiscreet .
but you clearly had no idea you were being filmed .
i wanted to ask you if you knew what it was .
and , if you do , what you think .
i' m sorry you got dragged into this .
the guy' s the son of algerian farmhands who worked for my parents around 1960 .
he has a pathological hatred of my family and he tries to hurt me with this stuff .
sorry .
that' s okay .
it can' t be very pleasant for you .
you' ve been to the police ?
sure , but they course won' t do anything , as long as nothing " dramatic " happens .
apparently , this guy' s out to wreck your career .
god knows where else he sent the tape .
that' s true .
why is he so bitter ?
sorry to pry but he didn' t appear very aggressive .
yes , i know .
i' m the aggressive one on the tape .
my visit was the consequence of his campaign of terror .
my wife and i are very worried naturally .
i imagine .
you have no idea what' s driving him ?
none at all .
apparently , he' s convinced my family and i mistreated him .
in fact , the last time i saw him , i was 6 .
he' s crazy .
you have my sympathy .
this is awful .
i hope it' s resolved soon .
it would be unfortunate if news of this leaked out .
i know .
i' il put a lawyer on the case .
do it .
good idea .
don' t worry about the new show .
i' il stay on top of it .
great , thanks .
not at all .
it' s my fight too .
you know how highly i think of you .
thank you .
can i have the tape ?
the tape ?
ah , the tape .
i destroyed it immediately .
i didn' t want it to fall into the wrong hands .
i see .
you' d have done the same , no ?
open up .
open up !
come on , open up !
open the damn door !
what do you think he should have done ?
what should he have done ?
are you kidding ?
you' d have bullshitted mathilde like that ?
people talk to each other , don' t they ?
calm down .
calm down .
it' s okay .
calm down .
time to get back to the office .
yes .
but the governor of nassiriyah province , an ltalian appointed by the americans
barbara contini , demands greater openness on the subject .
the ltalians come under british command as the official occupying power .
lt' s vital all coalition countries that have joined in this mission operate under the same rules of engagement .
this will result in greater homogeneity and better coordination .
ultimately , ltalian president ciampi ...
about time .
where have you been ?
i ate out with pierre .
without telling me ?
why switch off your cell phone ?
why ?
do you tell me everything you do ?
let' s not start that again .
exactly .
pierrot' s already in bed ?
i thought he was with you .
with me ?
you know i was at work , no ?
he was going over to yves ' after school .
you have his number ?
he was going to swim practice at 5 with yves and yves ' dad was picking them up .
hello , this is anne laurent .
i wanted to ask if you' ve seen pierrot .
really ?
did he say anything ?
yes , if you don' t mind , can i talk to him in person ?
hi , yves .
did pierrot tell you where he was going ?
no , that' s the point .
were you doing anything after ?
did you have a fight ?
no , i don' t know ...
okay , i see .
if you hear anything , can you give us a call ?
you have our number ?
okay , thank you .
goodbye .
he left yves ' house around 6 : 30 .
he said he' d be away with us for the ascension weekend .
i' il go look in his room .
well ?
i don' t know .
we have to call the police .
what if something' s happened to him ?
what ?
i don' t know .
what if he' s been hit by a car or ...
open up , police !
open up !
yes ?
what' s going on ?
where' s the boy ?
what boy ?
is that him ?
any sign of him ?
i' m going with them to the station .
i have no idea .
he has a son .
it must have been him who made the tapes .
they claim they don' t even know who pierrot is .
no , they only looked for pierrot .
they' re investigating kidnapping , not the tapes .
did anyone call ?
i was just asking , you never know .
i have to go .
call me if there' s any news .
of course .
you' d better go home now .
you have an early flight tomorrow ...
don' t worry .
i packed yesterday .
you know me ...
you' ve been really sweet but i prefer to be alone now .
on your own , you' il imagine the worst .
pierre ...
come on , let' s on .
if you need anything , just call .
promise ?
yes .
you can call any time .
thanks , i know .
corsica isn' t another planet .
see you , my dear .
well ?
no news .
it probably wasn' t an accident .
no reports from the hospitals .
and the two guys ?
they claim they don' t know him .
what about the tapes ?
they both deny it .
look , just drop it .
the police aren' t interested ... ... in anything other than kidnapping .
for the tapes , we need proof .
they' il look into it , but there' s a procedure to be followed .
there' s a procedure to be followed .
file a report , lawyer
the cops don' t care if it' s linked .
so they released them ?
don' t you want to come in ?
we' re just leaving .
we' d be in the way .
nonsense !
come on in ...
i asked them to go .
i was exhausted and wanted to be alone .
i' m sorry .
all this is ...
it makes me sick .
no , they kept them in custody .
the kid started yelling .
so they locked him up .
that got his dad started ...
so now they' re both in the cage for the night .
and then ?
then they' il let them go .
if there' s no proof , they have to .
there' s suspicion , nothing more .
what will you do now ?
now , i' m going to grab some food .
i haven' t eaten all day .
what the hell got into you ?
i' m sorry .
anne laurent ...
thank you very much .
come in , please .
no , thanks .
i' m badly parked .
i called my husband , who' s also delighted and says thank you .
it' s the least i could do .
please come in .
no , i have to go .
i just wanted to be sure he really came home .
what do you mean ?
i owe you an apology .
i ...
whatever for ?
i work nights at the hospital .
so i' m not always around .
when franois has friends over ...
well , we' re pretty laidback .
i didn' t know your son hadn' t called .
i got in at 7 ...
oh , it' s okay .
it' s not your fault if ...
you' re sure you won' t come in ?
thank you , no .
i don' t know how ... to express my gratitude .
it' s nothing .
i' m sorry you had such a fright .
goodbye .
thanks again .
why don' t you say anything ?
what' s there to say ?
that' s true .
what' s wrong ?
nothing .
come on !
what could be wrong ?
why didn' t you say you were staying with this franois guy ?
didn' t you think we' d be worried if you just vanished ?
what' s the problem , do you think ?
i don' t know .
stop being so pig headed .
what' s the matter ?
what , darling ?
if you don' t know , i don' t see what we can do about it .
there is no problem .
why should there be one ?
you know better than me .
leave me alone !
what do you mean , i know better ?
ask pierre .
he always knows everything !
what are you trying to say ?
nothing .
why did you say it then ?
are you jealous ?
what have you got into your head ?
that pierre and i ...
that' s absurd !
because we call each other a lot ?
he' s a friend .
a friend of mine and your dad' s .
what makes you think ...
stay here , i' m talking to you !
stop being so sullen .
you' ve no reason to act this way !
look at me , please !
i swear you' ve got it wrong .
i wonder how you could even think that .
i love you .
really ...
i love you .
dad and i were sick with worry when you didn' t come home .
you find that so ...
so absurd ?
maybe we weren' t sick , but we freaked .
because we love you .
i love you .
tomorrow , i' m interviewing the author of the smart gang .
you loved that book if memory serves me right ,
if you give me your copy , i' il ask him to sign it , okay ?
would you like that ?
are you okay ?
i' m glad you' re home .
goodnight .
goodnight , dad .
using berrychon as a pseudonym .
isabelle kept total control over rimbaud' s work .
it was a huge money maker .
that' s right .
she began to create this aura of a pious nun .
like a builder constructs a wall garden .
then , she began to meddle with rimbaud' s work .
we know that the poems that shocked her went on the fire .
i can agree with the portrait you draw of lsabelle .
it' s the same as i had before i began the book .
we agree , both of us , on that point .
at the same time , i' d like to raise a few ...
stop , this is getting too theoretical .
cut at " we agree on that point .
and go to when teul talks about homosexuality .
it' s around ... around 0 : 30 .
it wouldn' t matter .
it' s poetic license .
but i think rimbaud is ...
on " i think " let' s try slotting it in ...
what do you want know ?
what' s going on ?
thanks for coming .
come in .
what' s this all about ?
sit down .
no , i won' t .
what do you want ?
i truly had no idea about the tapes .
is that all ?
i called you because i wanted you to be present ...
it' s me please , try to get rid of them .
i' m in the bedroom .
something terrible' s happened .
i can' t face them right now .
hurry , please .
what' s going on ?
majid committed suicide .
i was there .
he slit his throat .
what ?
yes , exactly .
sadly , it' s no joke .
what do you mean you were there ?
i' m saying i was at his place .
he phoned me to come , so he could explain about the tapes .
so i went .
and ?
and nothing .
he said , " i wanted you to be present " and cut his throat .
that can' t be ...
try to get rid of them .
we need to talk .
what will i tell them ?
i don' t know .
what did you say when i called ?
that it was the anonymous caller asking for you .
and ?
nothing .
i excused myself and left .
i don' t know .
tell them you don' t feel well , or that pierrot' s sick .
please !
they' re done .
i saw .
not the light .
what did you tell them ?
that i' d lied to them .
that it was you on the phone .
that i had to meet you because you were in trouble .
they didn' t offer to come with you ?
what , you want a transcript of the conversation .
sorry .
what happened ?
it' s like i told you .
i went there .
he asked me in and killed himself .
there was a lot of blood .
then , i ran off .
you went for help ?
what ?
no , he died immediately .
what are you going to do ?
was anybody else around ?
no , why ?
come on !
what time did it happen ?
this afternoon around 4 , i guess .
so you went to the police or what ?
no .
what have you been doing ?
where were you ?
nowhere .
in town .
you have to tell the police .
if anyone saw you , you could be a suspect .
then he' d have achieved his goal .
what ?
what , do you have another explanation ?
what for ?
why else did he ask me there ?
what did you do to him ?
what ?
when ?
back then ?
who' d think up something like that ?
first , he sends all those damn tapes .
you remember the drawings ?
they must have been some kind of forewarning , huh ?
georges !
i told mom he was coughing up blood .
they didn' t believe me , you see ?
the doctor examined him , didn' t find anything .
he was an old fool .
our family doctor , see ?
then i told him dad wanted him to kill the rooster .
it was a ... nasty bird .
evil , always attacking us .
and he did it .
he cut its head off .
the rooster flapped around .
majid was covered in blood .
and i told them he did it to scare me .
to slit his own throat for that ...
a hell of a twisted joke , don' t you think ?
why were they here ?
who ?
pierre and mathilde .
it was planned .
we were going to watch your show .
i' d forgotten .
i thought they were in corsica .
just one week .
they got back yesterday .
hi , how are you ?
fine , thanks .
and you ?
i didn' t forget your book .
i called last week .
but it hasn' t arrived .
there' s no rush .
maybe it' s in today' s mail .
you spoke to malembert ?
yes , he' il bring you the file .
may i have a word , please ?
what do you want ?
i would like to talk with you .
i don' t have time .
goodbye .
what do you want with me ?
why are you so scared , sir ?
what do you want ?
why are you here ?
would you have let me into your house .
i have no time .
i' ve told you .
i don' t believe you , sir .
if you refuse to find the time , i' il make a real scene and tell people things they shouldn' t hear .
i can' t believe you' d want that .
is that a threat ?
i have nothing to hide .
really ?
young man , your father' s death must hurt .
but i refuse to be implicated by you .
be right there .
the police corroborated my statement .
it was a suicide .
so , please , get out of my face .
i' d also advise you to stop terrorizing us with stupid tapes .
i had nothing to do with the tapes .
just before he died your father insisted it wasn' t him .
believe what you want .
i' m not lying .
i' d like to talk to you , please .
i don' t want to argue with you in front of everyone .
say your piece and leave or i' il call the police .
i' il have you ejected .
you know you' re not allowed here .
i' m listening .
why so angry ?
what did i do to you ?
what did you do to me ?
for weeks , you terrorize my family and me with your damn tapes !
i won' t believe you' re not involved !
your father wasn' t capable of that .
why would i do that , sir ?
drop the dumbass politeness , okay ?
you deprived my father of a good education .
the orphanage teaches hatred not politeness .
yet my father raised me well .
i won' t forget that because of you .
we' re not finished .
what do you want ?
a fight ?
if you insist .
you' re probably stronger than me .
go ahead , hit me !
know what ?
you' re sick .
you' re as sick as your father .
i don' t know what dump obsessions he fed you but i can tell you this ...
you' il never give me a bad conscience because your father' s life was sad or a failure .
i' m not to blame !
do you get that ?
if you ever try to hurt me or my family , you' il regret it .
i guarantee it .
i' m sick of your crap !
ah , yes .
threats ...
you' re very good at those .
do you expect me to apologize ?
to whom ?
me ?
so what more do you want ?
nothing anymore .
i wondered how it feels , a man' s life on your conscience .
that' s all .
now i know .
great , everything' s okay then .
do you mind if i go now ?
be my guest .
hi , how is it going ?
i' m just calling to let you know i' m going to have a lie down .
no , i came home early .
i' m exhausted .
i must have picked up some kind of bug .
no , please , not that .
anyway , i wasn' t needed in the office .
everything' s great .
i just feel wiped out .
don' t wake me up when you get home .
i took 2 pills .
when' s pierrot home ?
you' il be back by then .
tell him to go easy on his poor old dad .
i love you .
bye .
come back here !
let go of me !
i don' t wanna go !
