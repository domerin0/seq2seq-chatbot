you' re retiring a little early .
you won' t be getting your full pension .
yes , sir , that' s right .
i won' t .
this isn' t because you were wounded , is it ?
wounded ?
because , i mean ... ... you' re behind a desk now .
not much chance of getting wounded there .
look , captain , it has nothing to do with that .
i' il make my speech .
they make me do this , you understand .
i hate to lose a good cop .
not too late to change your mind .
lot of good cops want to drop the whole kit and caboodle .
and who wouldn' t ?
the pay stinks ... ... and you' re up to your ears in human scum 16 hours a day .
but it gets in your blood .
a lot of good cops get to the point of ... ... slapping their badge down on this desk ... ... and find they just can' t do it .
how about you ?
will you stick with the team ?
no , captain .
i don' t think i will .
like i say , they make me ask .
you understand .

you sure you don' t want something ?
coffee , soda , something ?

i feel kind of stupid about this .
better safe than sorry .
that' s what i thought .
you have a restraining order against your husband ?
ex husband .
he' d show up on the wrong day ... ... or in the middle of the night , pounding on the door .
thing is , he has this horrendous temper .
i didn' t know if a restraining order was a good idea ... ... and if it' d do more harm than good .
but the judge said we should make an example of him .
so he can' t come within 100 feet of us .
or is it yards ?
which is it ?
feet or yards ?
that' s up to the judge .
i thought it was a set thing .
it' s at his discretion .
that' s interesting .
does he drink ?
oh , i thought you meant the judge !
no , i wouldn' t say so .
do drugs ?
but he has a propensity for violence ?
yeah , i think you could say that .
did he strike the little girl ?
did he strike you ?
not exactly .
not exactly ?
you know , there were times ... ... when i thought he was going to ... ... but i just didn' t want to wait until he got around to it .
it' s hard to explain .
he could , i think .
you think ?
hello , sir .
how are you today ?
i' m doing all right .
how about you ?
me ?
i' m terrible .
i' m sorry .

that' s a hell of a way to treat a vet , man .
you' re an animal doctor ?
no , a veteran .
i was in nam .
you must' ve been 10 years old .
i meant to say the gulf .

you picked a good day to leave .
you want another 3 year old to get shot in the head ?
is that what you want ?
tell me the truth !
i' m telling you the truth !

why would he go after your friends ?
i don' t know !
he attacked them on angel' s flight hill with a baseball bat !
a baseball bat ?

what did this guy look like ?
i don' t know .
he looked like you ... ... except he was taller and had hair .

did he wear a white shirt and tie ?
come over here , will you ?
we gotta keep the pressure on her .
don' t interrupt .
what about the bat ?

i' m listening .
we got a nutcase with a bag full of guns .
he' s in hollywood , heading west .
what is he up to ?
he' s up to a lot of trouble .
never mind , we' ve got a hallway full of suspects .
it wasn' t a gang thing .
i can tell you that .
angelina is a tramp and a liar .
we don' t appreciate you interfering with our investigation .
i' ve got a positive i. d. on the gym bag , okay ?
what' s this ?
a gym bag .
does this mean you' re putting me under arrest ?
you guys take off .
i gave you that speech earlier ... ... because that' s regulations .
they make me do it .
this one' s from me .
i' ve never liked you .
you know why ?
you don' t curse .
i don' t trust a man who doesn' t curse .
not a " fuck " or a " shit " in all these years .
real men curse .
and i don' t like a man who' s afraid to hit the street .
it' s bad for morale .
i' m not afraid .
get back behind that desk where you belong ... ... and don' t waste any more of my time pretending you' re a cop .
a man in a white shirt and tie shot up a phone booth near the whammyburger .
did you hear me ?
i heard you .
right about here , right ?
how did you know ?
he got the bag of guns at the drive by .
then you were right .
excuse me .
what is wrong with you ?
me ?
i' m a coward , the captain told me .
get out of my way .
hey , look .
it is your own fault .
you let everybody think that , when it was your wife .
she made you get off the street .
what happens between me and my wife is nobody' s business but mine !
sorry , i' ve been a bitch all day .
she didn' t make me quit .
i came home late one night ... ... and found her sitting in the dark .
she thought i' d been killed .
she thought i was a ghost .
i had to chase her all over the house .
i' m sorry .
forget it .
where are you going ?
see if i can earn my last day' s pay .
let me go with you .
i thought you were on duty .
what do you say , partner ?
fuck them !
go !
who were you talking to a while ago ?
you' re trying to scare me .
am i succeeding ?
no , you' re not succeeding .
so you just might as well stop it .
and you' re not scaring me out of my own house .
and you' re not coming here .
but i am .
i' m on my way .
you can count on that .
i' m past the point of no return .
do you know when that is ?
that' s the point in a journey ... ... where it' s longer to go back to the beginning ... ... than it is to continue to the end .
it' s like ...
remember when those astronauts got in trouble ?
they were going to the moon and something went wrong .
they had to get back to earth ... ... but they had passed the point of no return .
so they had to go all the way around the moon to get back ... ... and they were out of contact for hours .
everybody waited to see if a bunch of dead guys in a can ... ... would pop out the other side .
that' s me .
on the other side of the moon now ... ... out of contact ... ... and everybody' s just going to have to wait till i pop out .
the police are here .
did you know , beth ... ... that in certain south american countries it' s still legal ... ... to kill your wife if she insults you ?
they' re here right now .
i' m looking at one right now .
put him on the phone .
what are we gonna do ?
talk to the korean guy .
then we just start banging on doors .
what is it ?
where are you going ?
i' il be right back .
i' m sure the guy will let you use his bathroom .

what are you , a moron ?
if i wanted to be in a parking lot , i' d buy a ticket , you dumb bitch !
you can' t come this way .
what are you doing ?
fixing the street !
what does it look like ?
two days ago , it was fine .
you' re saying it fell apart in two days ?
well , i guess so .
pardon me , but that' s bullshit !
i don' t think anything' s wrong with the street .
you' re trying to justify your budgets .
are you nuts ?
i know how it works .
if you don' t spend your budget , you won' t get any money next year .
i want you to admit nothing' s wrong with the street !
fuck you , pal !
you' re not gonna hold us hostage with these yellow lights and big trucks .
i' m just here to keep people from falling in .
that' s all .
i want to hear it from you .
what' s wrong with the street ?
i don' t know .
i really don' t .
i think it' s a sewer job .
you' re lying .
what' s wrong with the street ?
nothing .
i knew it .

what the hell you trying to do ?

it' s not enough you got all this land for your little game ?
but you had to kill me with a golf ball ?

aren' t you ashamed of yourself ?
i gotta get some help !

building important things to protect us from the communists .
he works at notec .
the defense plant .
d fens .
call notec and see if you can get him .
so what' s going on with your son ?
how do you mean ?
you know exactly what i mean .
sometimes he sits through an entire meal without saying a word .
he just shovels food into his mouth like a machine .
i get so nervous ... ... i can' t swallow .
i' il sit there with the same piece of food in my mouth .
i have to spit it out .
when i do , he looks at me ... ... like he' d like to kill me .
don' t tell him i said that .
i promise i won' t .
i try not to be a burden .
i' m not just talking financial .
how could you be a burden to anyone ?
if william , or bill , as i like to call him ...
he likes bill .

what' s the word ?
he was fired over a month ago .

where has he been going every day ?
where has he been eating his lunch ?
why are you putting barbed wire on that fence ?
is it a joke ?

i lost my job .
actually , i didn' t lose it .

i' m overeducated , underskilled ...
maybe it' s the other way around .

and i' m obsolete .
i' m not economically viable .

and then when it got dark ... ... we' d all go to sleep together .
we' d all sleep together in the dark .
and everything ... ... would be just like it was before .
you can' t leave .
believe me , something' s happened to him .
it doesn' t take all day to drive from pasadena to venice .
that doesn' t constitute a threatening phone call .
the guy was talking about star trek or something .
he' s getting a kick out of scaring you .
please don' t leave .
there' s only one thing you can do to really feel safer .
next time there' s a proposition ... ... to cut the number of patrol cars on the street , vote no , okay ?

you' re angry because you got lied to ?
