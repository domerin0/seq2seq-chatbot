' ... 356 to london heathrow ,
' all remaining passengers please make your way ... '
harry , i' m not working , i' m going to my sister' s wedding .
customer service will have to survive without me .
but kat , we' ve had three delays and two reps call in sick .
and a 2505 on the 8 : 20 cpt to lgw .
and there' s this guy on line two who gut stuck with in laws because we couldn' t get him out of heathrow .
i' d love to help you , sincerely , but i haven' t seen my family in two years and my flight leaves in 15 minutes .
come on , kat .
please , i' m begging you .
bump the 14 : 14 to the upper on 16 : 10 .
what about line two ?
check my bags .
i understand , you want your family to see you the way you see yourself , or would , if you didn' t feel so victimized by them .
hello !
we regret that you were inconvenienced .
unfortunately , we are not liable .
but just this once i' il refund your ticket and credit you 10, 000 frequent flyer miles .
thank you for calling virgin atlantic .
your first trip ?
my sister' s getting married and the best man is my ex .
if i chicken out , i wanna know where the exits are .
i' m not a knuckler , i fly all the time .
the reason i can' t feel my legs is that any second my date is gonna sit down in 3b and i need him to look really good today .
hello , 3b .
thank you .
hey .
kat .
let' s sit .
i' m glad you found it ok .
the airport ...
the plane , i mean .
i' m sorry we couldn' t leave sooner .
i know you wanted to get settled before the party .
work must be crazy .
oh , i should warn you .
you know those families where everyone' s out of their mind but they' re your family so you love them ?
mine' s not like that .
i love my dad .
but since he' s my stepdad , he' s technically not family .
he' s more like a hostage .
' ladies and gentlemen ,
' we will shortly be arriving at london heathrow .
' on arrival , please remain seated
' until the seat belt sign has been switched off .
' local time is 4 : 22pm
' and the temperature is a warm 21 ... '
good morning .
' that' s 72 degrees fahrenheit .
' we would like to thank you for flying with us today
' and look forward to seeing you again soon . '
oh .
nick , please tell me you' re not wearing that tonight .
i am .
it' s no big deal really , it just looks like a tailor made your tie out of my dress .
don' t get me wrong matching' s fine .
it' s matchy matchy you wanna look out for .
we look like we' re trying too hard .
exactly .
i want us to look like we fit but not like we' re trying to look like we fit .
let me teach you a trick .
if you look people in the eye , they' il never notice what you' re wearing .
there' s no way i' m showing up in his and her outfits so if you' re gonna wear that tie , i have to change my dress .
driver , will you please pull over somewhere ?
i' m sorry .
i promise this is the last one .
you must think ...
who knows what you think ?
i know how important this is for you .
but remember , you' re a beautiful woman and you' ve got everything going for you .
don' t patronize me .
i feel like crap but i wanna look hot doing it .
mission accomplished .
really ?
don' t get too attached .
i prefer the red one .
i' il let her know .
hmm ...
hmm , nice dress , " or " hmm ...
gorgeous .
i was insane to let you go " ?
well , i' d shag you .
if that' s all right with you ?
i don' t know if i can do this .
well , you can never be sure of anything but we still have to go inside .
aunt bea !
dear girl .
this should have been you getting married .
you know , you didn' t have to return the gravy boat .
and to think jeffrey is the best man .
have you met nick ?
how do you do ?
oh .
charming .
and what do you do ?
excuse us .
what a nightmare .
ok , we need a story .
you' re a therapist , we just started dating and you' re crazy about me .
count it .
6, 000 even .
oh , i trust you .
no .
count it .
all right .
i' il cover expenses but if you want to be intimate , we talk money first .
that won' t be an issue .
i find the idea of sex for money morally repugnant .
i' m sorry .
no offense .
do me a favor , quit apologizing .
if you look at this as a business transaction , maybe you won' t feel compelled to keep saying sorry .
i' m sorry .
it' s also really annoying .
sorry .
sorry .
pussy kat !
what happened to you ?
pull over for a quickie ?
mom , this is so not the time to be yourself .
and who might this be ?
hi .
i' m the new guy .
it' s great to meet you .
lovely .
this is a marathon , not a sprint .
we' ve got welcome cocktails today then tomorrow' s young people in the park and stags and hens .
friday' s the picnic , then the rehearsal dinner and since you have left no margin for jetlag ,
i need you to hydrate .
dad .
my darling .
meet nick .
professor ellis .
how do you do ?
kat ?
kat !
oooh !
i' m getting married !
oh , kitty !
hey !
oh , i missed you so much .
gosh , who' s the hunky , huh ?
nice .
there you are !
get over here !
at times like these , i find a good , stiff drink helps .
can i get you a refill , sir ?
very kind of you .
where did you find him ?
thank you .
yellow pages .
hello !
sweet jesus .
who gave that woman an amp ?
hello .
hello ?
oh .
wonderful .
it' s finally working .
does everybody have a drink ?
because i am going to say a few words .
welcome , friends and family ...
i' m ...
victor and i are so happy that you' re here to celebrate with us as we welcome edward and the fletcher wootens into our family .
we always thought that we would marry off kat first .
we had good reason to hope because she was so popular with the boys at school and we came pretty close once , but , as you all know , that crashed and burned .
luckily , we were able to get the deposit back ,
so here we are again ...
to the bride and groom .
oh .
yes .
yes .
well , back to the bride and groom to be .
um ...
edward , we are so glad that you fell in love with the girl next door .
our amy .
congratulations , babies .
congratulations .
jeffrey .
hello .
kat mandu .
wow , you look gorgeous .
gorgeous .
oh , my god !
oh , my god !
oh , my god , oh , my god , oh , my god , oh , my god !
top kat !
ooooh !
where the bloody hell have you been ?
i have gynecologists that call more often .
you have more than one ?
i play them off against each other .
hello , arsehole .
since you dumped my cousin brutally , you won' t mind if i steal her away , will you ?
thanks .
you didn' t have to do that .
i wasn' t saving you from him ,
i was saving you from yourself .
you , my love , are too bloody nice .
i' ve never seen so many beautiful women in one room .
did he bring a date ?
darling , why waste time on that horse' s arse when mr. tie me up , tie me down is waiting for you over there ?
what does he do ?
he' s a therapist .
the perils of paranoia .
yes .
oh , god .
i think i' ve just come .
thank you .
can i have that ?
hm .
thank you .
you know what i love about all this , kat ?
there' s finally a reason for the world to revolve around you ?
exactly .
there you are .
how' s the future missus ?
i' m perfect , i' m all ginny .
thanks , snufflepop .
mmm !
mm mm mm !
wow !
am i not the luckiest bastard on earth ?
aw !
well , i' il dance to that .
oh !
oh , jesus !
that' s what he gets for not taking dance lessons until two days before the wedding .
who' s ever heard of dance lessons for a wedding ?
just about everyone .
you are taking the piss ?
we' il go with you .
i don' t even know you , hunky dunky , and i love you already .
dance lessons ?
hm .
right .
hey .
oh .
hello .
weddings are a celebration of love and commitment ... in utopia .
in the real world they' re an excuse to drink excessively and say things you shouldn' t .
a philosopher , huh ?
well , shrink .
crikey !
what ?
no , nothing .
no , tell me .
well , you yanks and your therapy , it' s a load of touchy feely mumbo jumbo .
spilling your guts to a total stranger , it' s not natural .
oh , god .
it' s just ...
there' s this girl that i care for ...
well , i suppose you could say i love her .
the bugger is , she' s here with some other guy .
there you are .
hey , kat .
hey , kat .
oh , hey , yourself .
i see you met my ex .
i was just telling him how we met .
mm .
the knicks game .
oh , yes .
yeah ...
oh .
you hate sport .
i hate cricket .
right , yes .
well , i should go and ... go .
he looks miserable .
what were you talking about ?
he seems a little drunk but i think he' s still crazy about you .
do i know you from somewhere ?
no .
what did he say ?
you don' t ...
you don' t think he wants me back ?
when we are together )
# love started making sense
# i always make mistakes at my expense
# love has placed a seed
# and you' re the sun that shines down upon me
# yeah , when we are together
# and when we are apart #
are you ok ?
here we are .
thank god !
oh !
thanks , mom .
there you are , darling .
thanks , dad .
god !
thanks again for having me .
don' t be silly .
it' s wonderful to meet you .
although technically , i never knew you existed .
come on , bunny .
i love surprises .
where' s nick sleeping ?
my mother has this rule about sharing when there' s no ring involved ...
don' t be silly .
what ?
i am not as small town as my daughter seems to think .
sorry about this .
i went through a painfully earnest floral phase .
air supply ?
oh .
my parents had a german exchange student a few years back .
he must have left it here .
everyone knows their greatest hits .
some of their lesser known ballads are surprisingly poignant .
is that an old habit from ballet class or from a lifetime of walking on eggshells ?
i never took ballet .
how' d you know that was me ?
i have a friend at the magazine .
so much for anonymity .
go ahead , take a look .
it' s part of the package .
i' m sorry , i' m just a little nervous .
i never thought anything like this could happen to me .
this happened to you ?
it happened in the sense that i picked up the phone , tracked you down , flew you over her and gave you $6, 000 .
will you grab my shampoo , please ?
shampoo !
got it .
# i' m all out love , i' m so lost without you
# i know you were right , believing for so long
# i' m all out of love , what am i without you ?
# i can' t be too late to say that i was so wrong #
the part where you were a sexual surrogate and then started to ... branch out , is ...
is that really how it happened ?
the real story my mother was a hippie , and a stripper .
she was insanely inappropriate with me , she washed her lingerie in my bath water while i was still in it .
oh .
so as an adult , i needed to find ways to experience intimacy and sex
but with rules that couldn' t be violated .
wow .
i' m just screwing with you .
you shit .
ok , this part .
you say , and i quote ,
every woman has the exact love life she wants .
that seems a broad generalization ...
oh !
oh .
do you honestly believe that i want to be single and miserable ?
do you think that i want to be hung up on some guy who led me on for years and out of the blue shattered my heart ?
first of all , there' s no such thing as out of the blue .
and second of all , yeah .
what ?
when you' re ready to let go , to be un single and un miserable , you will .
till then ...
so when you were talking to jeffrey before , how did he sound ?
like a harmless , self absorbed toolbox .
seriously .
he sounded tormented .
tormented ?
how ?
like he' s ... jealous that i' m here with someone else , or like ... he regrets throwing away our life together ?
it' s just that ... this hasn' t really turned out the way that i thought it would .
hey , nick .
oh oh oh !
he seems more mature .
run , you fat tart !
come on .
# shoo be do be do be do be do wop wop , shoo be do be do be do be do wop wop #
come on , throw it .
throw it !
# you' il look at me , and even though i know ... #
well played , darling .
ed !
what ?
# one fine day ... #
are you ready , tj ?
bugger off .
# you' re gonna want me for your girl # shoo be do be do be do be do wop wop
# oh , yeah #
all right , batter , batter .
# the arms i long for will open wide # shoo be do be do be do be do wop wop
# and you' il be proud to have me # shoo be do be do be do be do wop wop
# right by your side # shoo be do be do be do be do wop wop
# one fine day
# you' re gonna want me for your girl # shoo be do be do be do be do wop wop #
move back .
yeah .
# though i know you' re the kind of boy ... # come on , kat . # who only wants to run around # batter up .
you' re up , kat . # i' il be waiting ... # go , kat .
# someday , darling , you' il come to me
# when you want to settle down , oh ! #
be nice to me , jeffrey .
# one fine day , we' il meet once more # shoo be do be do be do be do wop wop #
out !
yes !
# one fine day ... #
lose the game .
# you' re gonna want me for your girl #
no !
come on !
edward .
come on !
come on , you sexy little monkey .
come on !
you' re supposed to be helping .
oh , trust me .
i am .
# one fine day , oh yeah # one fine day
# you' re gonna want me for your girl # one fine day
# one fine day # oh yeah
# one fine day #
what' s with the socks ?
it' s a golf themed bachelorette .
have you ever done a wedding before ?
no , but i have done funerals .
an escort at a funeral ?
someone' s dead .
yeah , imagine facing that alone .
ah .
catch .
make sure he stays on the right side of the road .
which is , of course , the left .
that' s right .
so , are you ever attracted to your clients ?
i know you' re curious about my business but i really can' t discuss other clients .
come on !
how many of them want to sleep with you ?
you know , i swear it' s not about the sex .
it' s about understanding what people need .
please !
you' re like the yoda of escorts .
getting you on the phone was harder than getting into college .
no , i don' t play games .
no gimmicks .
mm hm .
it' s much more ...
subtle ?
it' s not about me .
it' s about you .
show me .
come on .
hmm ...
what' s holding me back ?
i think it' s the words " morally repugnant " .
show me .
close your eyes .
close your eyes .
close your eyes .
you' re safe , you can relax .
i' m not gonna kiss you .
he' s gonna be so sorry he lost you .
so , stop worrying .
forget the past .
forget the pain .
and remember ... what an incredible woman you are .
if you do that , he' il realize what he lost .
holy crap !
you' re worth every penny .
you should get going .
mm hm .
ok , yoda .
boogie shoes )
to amy !
# girl , to be with you is my favorite thing #
i thought you might need this .
silly me .
where was my head ?
bye .
listen , why don' t you stay
and have a little fiery drink with us , eh ?
uh ...
it' s fine .
come on .
you know you want to !
oh , i can see why .
you' re lovely .
isn' t he lovely ?
have you smelt him ?
he smells lovely !
can you believe kat gets to shag this guy ?
no , really , you should send god a bottle of wine or a quiche or something .
look at those buns .
fresh from the bakery .
it must feel great getting paid just for being you .
who says i' m being me ?
excuse me .
amy , thank you for granting me a rare glimpse into a timeless female ritual .
here' s to the husbands who' ve won you , the losers who' ve lost you and the lucky bastards who' ve yet to meet you .
and to the cock in the henhouse .
i can' t believe you found him first .
i am so depressed .
will somebody buy my hoo hah a drink ?
you remember when we took the girls hiking in the lake district ?
no .
you do !
blistering heat in the morning , rained all afternoon .
no .
you backed your car over a copper' s bicycle .
sorry , no .
the rat and gherkin .
splendid local scrumpy .
mm .
amy wore that little bikini thing .
but somehow it was kat that got stung by nettles .
kat never said a word until amy caught her scratching her arse .
then you rubbed it with a dock leaf to bring down the swelling .
yeah , i remember it .
i didn' t deserve her back then .
and you do now ?
what is his problem ?
what ?
there' s something about him i don' t like .
he' s less than 90 per cent body fat and he' s shagging your ex .
no , that is not it .
look at him , he' s walking around all american , like he owns the place .
oh , no !
come on , this is your last chance .
woody ?
not yet , but it' s getting there !
it' s getting there !
oh , my god !
what are you doing here ?
i thought you were in san francisco , or was it nepal ?
close .
sydney .
but it turns out that i missed the rain .
did kat tell you that she dumped you because of your funky breath ?
she' s drunk .
but i didn' t ...
i didn' t really dump you .
right ?
hard .
but it was understandable , you were one of the hottest girls in school .
and we know that kat was one of the hottest expats in school because she was voted best eyes and brightest smile and the most likely to age well .
you' re my half sister but i whole love you .
how about you get my half sister a seventh hole ?
tequila .
tequila .
sure .
are you all right ?
i don' t know if i can do this .
the seventh hole ?
no !
the wedding .
i shouldn' t be allowed to get married .
i shouldn' t .
what are you talking about ?
tj !
come on !
come on !
what' s wrong with jeffrey ?
as if i would sleep with a stripper !
i' m about to get married .
you have to ...
it' s been my experience that a man in love doesn' t want a prostitute .
eddie , you did the right thing .
how do you know so much ... about so much ?
i' m a hooker .
i like that .
i got the feeling )
# baby !
# sometimes i' m down
# i' m level , level with the ground
# whoa
# baby , you treat me
# bad ... #
# no , i know
# know you don' t mean it now
# i just don' t know when to say bye bye
# yeah
# uh
# uh , uh
# uh , uh , whoa !
# baby
# i' ve got that feeling , baby ... #
i just don' t feel very well .

ladies ...
how much do you rock , tj ? ... that was a top night .
top night !
all out of love )
she' s getting married !
# i' m all out of love
# i' m so lost without you
# i know you were right
# believing for so long
# i' m all out of love
# what am i without you ?
# i can' t be too late
# i know i was so wrong
# i' m all out of love
# what am i without you ?
# i can' t be too late
# to say that i was so wrong ... #
secret )
are you ok ?
ooh !
ow !
# watch the sun rise
# say your goodbyes
# off we go
# some conversation
# no contemplation
# hit the road
# car overheats
# jump out of my seat
# on the side of the highway , baby
# i know i don' t know you
# but i want you so bad
# everyone has a secret
# oh , can they keep it ?
# oh , no , they can' t #
morning .
morning .
ahoy , there !
hi , dad .
i don' t know what works for you but i brought you some black coffee and some stale crackers , egg and cheese sandwich and a bloody mary .
that' s very sweet of you .
but i need to ask you something .
what happened last night ?
nothing .
thanks .
is this for last night ?
no !
how could it be ?
nothing happened .
if i was gonna charge you , i said i' d tell you first .
i didn' t want you to think that i was expecting anything for free or that i was expecting anything at all .
i mean , obviously i was expecting something or else i wouldn' t have stopped at that atm .
just so you know , you' re 300 short .
wait , you' re telling me that if something happened last night ,
i' d have to pay you $1, 700 ?
that' s a down payment on a ford focus .
not dollars , pounds .
besides , it includes , you know ...
that' s the extra 300 .
are you a boatsman , son ?
i am now , sir .
i' m glad someone' s making use of her at last .
the boat , i mean .
to defile . " four letters .
good morning , daddy .
ah .
what if i didn' t want you to do that to me ?
the 300' s for you doing it to me .
if anything had happened , it would have been one of the highlights , for you .
but nothing did .
that' s why you get to keep your money .
the wedding dance is the most important dance moment in a person' s life .
a room full of friends and family , watching , smiling , betting on how long the marriage will last .
all you' il have is each other and whatever skills you acquire today .
and pair off .
sway )
# when marimba rhythms start to play ... # breathe .
good , that' s a nice position .
now , your left foot .
her right foot .
good .
and we' il try to glide across the floor .
come a little bit closer together .
moving .
trying to turn .
what' s the matter , nick ?
two left feet ?
oh !
# stay with me , sway with me
# other dancers may be on the floor
# dear , but my eyes will see only you
# only you have that magic technique
# when we sway i go weak
# i can hear the sound of violins
# long before it begins
# make me thrill as only you know how
# sway me smooth , sway me now
# like a flower bending in the breeze
# bend with me , sway with ease
# when we dance you have a way with me
# stay with me , sway with me
# like a flower bending in the breeze
# bend with me , sway with ease
# when we dance you have a way with me #
when i told you i' d never done a wedding before , it wasn' t because i' d never been asked .
i' d just never said yes .
why' d you say yes to me ?
there was something in your voice on the phone that day .
desperation ?
i think it was hope .
get a move on , you lovebirds .
i' m getting married in the morning .
ah , hello , bambi .
darling , please don' t do that .
oh , wow .
that' s a big bed .
you know what pisses me off ?
i' ve been spilling my guts all weekend and i don' t know anything about you .
i' m allergic to fabric softener .
i' m majoring in comparative literature at brown .
i hate anchovies .
i think i' d miss you even if we' d never met .
come on !
i' m a little concerned ...
i' m just ...
it makes me nervous ... you know , i might just call you .
but if i did , i would lose , because my hand is complete shite .
ohhh .
i' m in .
come on .
there' s gotta be something wrong with him .
i bet his thingy bends , doesn' t it ?
got a little kink in it .
oh , no , don' t tell me .
it' s bloody perfect .
i' m going to see you .
looky , looky here .
a full house .
oh ho ho !
has anyone seen my future wife ?
she' il kill me if i don' t serve her first .
have you guys ever had a real honest to god fight , ever ?
yes , of course .
yeah , right .
well , apparently , makeup sex is the best kind .
not that i' m ever going to find out .
give me that !
come on !
no , no !
don' t !
come on !
you seem to have a way with women .
why don' t you go and rustle up the bride ?
get her to join the party .
why are you bringing this up now ?
i love ed .
what do you want from me ?
i want you to tell me ...
blue shirt or ... white shirt for the , er , rehearsal dinner ?
sorry to interrupt .
your dad sent me .
what for ?
to make sure you' re ok .
kat , could i have a word ?
it' il only take a moment .
let me think .
you stole seven years of her life with your bullshit and your charm and now you' d like just a moment ?
sure .
go right ahead .
thanks for the solidarity , mum , but next time a little less information .
do you believe a place has a memory ?
even before ed and i started dating , we all used to come up here in the summer and spend weekends .
god , i hope it doesn' t remember everything .
no matter how certain one is of one' s position of what one should or shouldn' t do , one sometimes discovers that one is not as one would have hoped one would have been .
what exactly are you trying to say ?
i' m sorry .
look , i feel like i need to tell you something .
you' re not even listening .
i' m sorry .
i' il be back in a minute .
hey , is everything ok ?
yeah .
yeah .
anchovy , nick ?
i remember the day i met kat .
it was in new york .
i' d been seeing bunny for a few months and she finally trusted me enough to meet her kid .
so i' m over at her place and in walks this little monster .
that was it .
i was a goner .
that was the day i became a dad .
you know , nick , you think it' s going to get easier as they get older , that you' re going to worry about them less .
or that you' re going to trust the world more .
but that' s just not how it happens .
this may not make much sense to you , sir , but i' d like to ask your permission to date your daughter .
i thought you already were .
i blame ...
i blame tony peepants .
no .
let' s have the story .
kat , come on .
no .
i have to initiate nick into our family .
i blame tony for why my two girls just don' t seem to be able to get along .
don' t deny it .
you barely tolerate each other .
come on .
it' s true .
the only thing you' ve got in common is you' re both attracted to me .
it started after we moved here .
my two girls got into a fight over tony peepants and have never made up since .
apparently , kat and i were inseparable .
if kat ate a banana , amy threw it up .
if amy threw it up , kat ate it .
so we were eating and throwing up together in harmony until tony walked me home from school one day .
he was my first boyfriend .
tony ignored kat because he wanted to play with me .
anyway , the point of the story is that tony ended up with a chair in his face .
it was plastic and child sized .
as i recall , there were stitches involved .
come on , bunny , 15 stitches .
so is that when he peed in his pants ?
he cried a lot , but there was no peeing .
so what' s with the nickname ?
i have absolutely no idea .
let me get some more wine .
would you marry me if i asked ?
that was a yes .
did you see that ?
and you know , i thought perhaps you ...
bollocks .
sorry .
i had no idea this would be so difficult .
i just feel like i owe you an explanation .
relax , relax .
it' s fine .
i promise .
and i should probably admit that ...
i brought nick with me to torture you , slowly , for the entire weekend .
but then , i don' t know , something happened and now ...
i hope this doesn' t hurt your feelings but i' m just sick of you and me .
of our whole story , so come on , let' s just go upstairs and eat some tiramisu .
i slept with your sister .
i' m sorry ?
well , i shagged amy , two years ago .
that' s why i broke it off with you .
and then after you left , sod it , we kept at it like rabbits , until we both realized it was absolutely mad and , obviously , morally wrong .
and then that was it .
but last christmas , when ed proposed ,
i realized ...
i' m in love with her .
good lord , say something , please .
oh , my god , he' s told you , hasn' t he ?
you knew ?
kat , i' m so sorry .
i' m so ...
kat .
kat , please .
kat , please don' t say anything .
i can' t believe you told her .
what' s going on ?
nothing .
it doesn' t look like nothing .
now is not the time to catch on , ed .
ok .
good .
leave me alone .
you knew and you didn' t tell me .
wait up .
i can' t believe i trusted you .
come on .
you' ve got to stop running .
how could you not have told me ?
what did you expect me to say ?
you let me make a fool of myself .
you lied to me , but i guess i shouldn' t be surprised because that' s what you do .
that' s who you are .
you' re a liar .
you' re judging me ?
that' s a good one .
you' re going to point a finger at me , the guy that you hired to pretend to be your boyfriend ?
you' re right .
i was so desperate to make everyone believe that i was happy that i paid $6, 000 for a lie .
and , at the end of the day , the only one who ended up falling for it was me .
i wish i could say it was worth it .
go ahead , kat , hate me .
i think you' re running out of steam on this whole jeffrey thing anyhow .
maybe now you' il be able to hold on to this long enough to ruin your next relationship .
nick .
i' m just checking into a hotel .
don' t be ridiculous .
it' s late .
take the car .
actually , the boathouse is empty .
look , i don' t know what' s going on with you two but i' m sure you' il work it out .
you couldn' t be more perfect if she' d picked you out of a catalog .
thanks , ed .
hey .
hey .
i just ...
i wanted to say thank you for not outing me in front of ed .
i want to tell him , just not the night before our wedding .
you know , with these things , timing is everything .
you' re right .
you should time it right , so that when he hears that you repeatedly screwed his best friend , he won' t feel like the world is collapsing and there' s no escape because you tricked him into marrying you .
kat ...
don' t worry .
your wedding will be perfect .
tomorrow i' il say all the right things and you' il deal with ed when you' re ready .
but right now , tonight , i' m not going to pretend it' s ok .
home )
and that' s your first flight out ?
# another summer day has come and gone away #
all right , thanks . # in paris and rome
# i wanna go home
# mmm
# another aeroplane , another sunny place
# i' m lucky , i know
# but i wanna go home
# mm , i' ve got to go home
# and i feel just like i' m living ... #
i' m ok . # someone else' s life
# it' s like i just stepped outside ... #
i don' t believe you .
i' m fine , really .
nothing a bottle of jack and a straight razor couldn' t fix .
anyway , it doesn' t matter .
it' s amy' s day .
get in the car , darling .
no , no .
smile .
hello .
i' ve been looking for you .
so , why did you let him go ?
it' s complicated , dad .
right .
it probably wouldn' t have worked out anyway , huh ?
i remember reading a fascinating article in the new york times magazine once , where this guy said ,
every woman has the exact love life she wants .
you know what ?
i agree with him .
but i refuse to believe that this is what you want , kat .
ever since you were little , you' ve always worried about what other people think .
now , come on .
what do you think ?
is he the guy for you ?
then go and get him .
hello , darling .
your mother said you wanted to have a quick word .
no , no , no , i ...
there' s something you should know before you marry me .
what is it ?
i wanted to tell you but i was afraid you' d never forgive me and i just ...
i love you so much .
i' m sorry .
i knew you were seeing someone else when we finally got together , but not jeffrey .
does kat know ?
jeffrey told her last night .
excuse me .
ed ?
ed ...
calm down , ed .
ed !
tj !
ah !
ed , calm down !
it' s all sorted !
she wants you !
i' ve given up !
what' s the problem ?
you back stabbing weasel !
that' s not fair .
it was before you guys were even dating .
but you were engaged to her sister .
ed , calm down !
we can talk about this like civilized human beings .
i look like a total wanker , don' t i ?
yeah , kind of .
get in the car , ed .
he' s halfway to france by now .
whoa !
i trust you' ve enjoyed your trip to england .
yeah , it was fantastic .
thanks , eddie .
you know , i felt sorry for you last night .
i was just sitting there like some smug arse , thinking , " aren' t i a lucky sod ?
i forgave her when i thought it was just some random bloke .
but not jeffrey .
i' ve had her up on a pedestal ever since ...
ever since i put her up there .
what a mess i' ve made , huh ?
i' m so sorry .
the hardest thing' s loving someone and then having the courage to let them love you back .
but if you know her shit and she knows yours and at the end of the day , you still would rather give up than try ...
nothing' s ever gonna be worth it .
maybe think about it this way .
you go back , you get to spend the rest of your life having really great makeup sex .
ed ?
must run !
hi .
hi .
last night , when we were fighting , i thought this was over .
and i was going to leave you alone and just take off but ...
then i realized i' d rather fight with you than make love with anyone else .
i should get going .
what ?
no , you can' t .
i have to .
i' m the best man .
save the last dance for me )
# you can dance every dance with the guy who gives you the eye
# let him hold you tight
