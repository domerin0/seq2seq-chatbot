has there been a burglary ?
no , no , no , i just wondered if ...
you know errr ... if you noticed anything unusual lately ?
unusual ?
ah , never mind , mrs. shrike .
i am sorry ... to disturb you so late .
good night .
miller was operating the mill in long sleeves .
miller' s arm was in the cutting zone of mill while it was off .
three : the mill suddenly activates , catching miller' s sleeve , resulting in this .
what is the fucking point ?
these accidents are never pretty , mr. reznik .
our job is to investigate these events from every possible angles ...
so that we might prevent their reoccurrence .
so we' d appreciate it if you are a bit more co operative .
i knocked into the fucking activator by mistake .
what caused the mistake , mr. reznik ?
i was distracted .
by what ?
what distracted you ?
it was ivan , i was watching ivan on the pit .
the whole thing is my fault , okay .
who did you say ?
the new arcwelder , i don' t know his last name .
what new arcwelder ?
ivan , the guy from the swing shift .
reynolds was picked up on a warrant this guy got his place .
what the fuck are you talking about , reznik ?
reynolds is right over there on the pit as usual , busting his ass .
there is no ivan in national machine , reznik .
what is this ?
mr. reznik have you recently suffered any head injuries ?
ever hear of pumpkin pie ?
no
trevor yeah
can i ask you a question ?
sure
why do you go all of your way to come here every night ?
is it all the way ?
an airport ?
for coffee and pie ?
suppose i went to danni' s ...
suddenly i get an overwhelming urge to skip town .
could i do that just in any diner ?
is someone chasing you ?
not yet .
but they will when they find out who i am .
oh really !
who are you ?
can you keep a secret ?
to the grave .
i am elvis presley .
i ran away from home to pursue my blue collar aspirations .
i thought you looked familiar .
got plans for mother' s day ?
i am taking my little boy to the amusement park .
suppose to be my day and he gets all the fun .
that is ok , when he is older
i will let him make it up to me .
a little guilt goes a long way .
how about you ?
cemetery
oh , i am sorry thanks
i lost mine too .
still hurts .
i am not so good at losing family .
who is ?
what' s weird is that it did not hit until i picked out her burial dress .
i pictured her while buying it ... ... not knowing it would ...
you know , be the one .
seems unfair , isn' t it ?
not knowing things like that
hey , how about spending the day with me and nicolas after the cemetery ?
sounds dreamy
hey reynolds , what did the feds want you for ?
armed robbery .
oh yeah , that is right , because i and jackson had you packed and pantified ... ain' t that right , jackson ?
hey , i don' t see what is so fucking funny .
you clowns think this' s fucking like some big joke but it ain' t !
personally , i don' t feel too comfortable working with you .
you made me nervous .
you look like shit , acting all crazy .
what is up with you ?
nothing is up with me .
it was an accident and i am the one who gotta live with it , not you .
you ain' t hearing me , man .
nobody wants you here .
nobody .
see you tomorrow .
hey
howdy , partner .
you gotta go back to the shop .
tucker needs to see you .
what about ?
i don' t know , but it seemed important .
what !
he' s ganna have to wait , it is miller time .
we need to talk .
follow me .
come on !
another bourbon .
make it double .
you shooting coke or something ?
you look like a dope fiend to me .
no offence .
i don' t use drugs .
i mean i don' t even drink .
how about abnormally ?
i see reynolds is back to work .
gets to me bail
i will tell you one thing , if i dig , you are showing carbon to it .
would you ? never trust a con , cowboy !
they ain' t get to live to be honest .
where they hiding you these days ?
around
hey , you wanna see something ?
look at that .
lost them on a lake .
they took a big toe from the left foot and a finger from my right .
that is why i walk with a gimp .
yeah , i can' t shuffle my cock like i used to but the ladies sure like it .
oh , no .
you look like you have seen a ghost .
funny you should say that .
the guys from work don' t think you exist .
that is why i can' t get a raise .
according to tucker , you are not even on the payroll .
you believe that ?
why would they lie ?
they just have a little bit of fun with you .
i am not laughing .
quit fucking around , a guy lost his arm .
he could have died .
that ain' t my problem .
you caused the accident , not me .
where are you going ?
take a leak , you wanna watch ?
i will be right back , don' t just bail me now .
hello ?
hey reynolds , it' s trevor .
what time is it ?
how are they biting reynolds ?
you , you are drunk , reznik .
the game' s over .
i got proof on you .
i could use it .
you better watch your fucking ass buddy , before you lose it .
trevor ?
i need to see you , stevie .
well , jesus , trevor , i am not exactly alone here .
please , stevie .
i think i am falling apart .
can you come back in an hour ?
no , no , no , no , i need to see you now .
in case of something happens , i need someone to know .
ok , give me a minute .
i appreciate you making time for me , you are the only one i can talk to .
my pleasure .
most guys don' t come here for my conversation .
something is happening to me , stevie .
some kind of ... plot .
there was an accident at the shop .
a man was nearly killed thanks to me .
oh , my god !
now the guys at work are against me .
they want me out and i don' t blame them .
just the way they' re going about it ...
their eyes , their little games .
what ?
e r ..
e r ..
t u c k e r trevor ?
tucker ?
maybe err you take this accident thing a bit too hard .
i mean ...

you wanna know something else ?
made me realised what a wonderful mother i had .
you will realise that too some day .
what is that ?

what does that mean ?
well , a route is a road you take when you' re on a long journey .
can we go in ?
well , nicolas , maybe we should wait for your mother .
what for ?
you are going straight to hell on route 666 .
ride here if you dare !
you are going straight to hell on route 666 .

he is epileptic .
i should have told you .
i will call an ambulance .
no , thanks .
it is ok , baby .
it hasn' t happened for a while .
i didn' t think to mention it .
i could have killed myself for taking him on that ride .
it' s ok , it' s not your fault .
he won' t even remember it , as if nothing ever happened .
wanna come in ?
i think you could use a drink .
i hope wine is okay with you .
that' il work .
what good is it at home if you can' t relax in it .
i will have to remember that .
trevor ?

why are you always leaving such generous tips ?
do i ?
20 dollars for coffee and pie ?
and entertainment .
entertainment ?

trevor , you don' t have to buy my companionship .
sorry , i wasn' t meant that way .

i wish there is someway i can repay you .
well , for a start , you can give me your left arm .
in fact , that is why i came by here today .
isn' t it , tucker ?
fair is fair
we are just razzing you , kid
you keep your left arm , i will keep my settlement .
hell !
how can a guy lost an arm end up like getting a deal like this ?
so , i guess you can call me lucky .

or was it you ?
you sick bastard , you' re imagining things again !
oh yeah ?

it' s an occupational hazard .
so , trevor , are you gonna rescue me from this miserable life or what ?
i could give it up for the right guy .
oh , that came out wrong .
what i mean is ...
i would , you know , stop hooking if you wanted me to .
i mean , there are lots of pancakes out there , right ?
i think i' d like that .
mr. reznik .
i am sorry , i thought it was somebody else .
you leave me in such a scare .
what are you doing in my apartment ?
there is a leak in my ceiling .
it' s coming from your apartment .
that' s impossible .
i' m gonna leave a note .
a note ?
what kind of note ?
about the leak .
what' s that terrible smell ?
there is no leak in this apartment .
now if you would excuse me ...
you' re sure you' re alright , mr. reznik ?
yeah , i' m sure .
if you need anything , please call first .
miller !
hey , reznik .
it' s a pleasant surprise .
we need to talk .
take a look at this , huh ?
picked it up at grossens , top of the line .
let' s not trim anyting for a while .
i need to be doing something .
can' t just watch the soap opera all day .
that hydro will be here tomorrow .
you won' t .
listen to the doctor .
margie , this is reznik .
the man who cost me my arm .
how do you do , mrs. miller ?
i' ve been better , mr. reznik .
is there some place we can talk ?
check it out .
it' s a beauty .
8 cylinders
speed sensitive steering
abs breaking with road texure and tension
defence lock up helps you maintain control in emergencies .
of course , it' s automatic .
hell i wanted a stick ... but i figured my shifting ability wouldn' t be so hot .
you know i am not at national any more , right ?
yeah , i heard about it .
it sounds like you almost lost one yourself , huh ?
did you find that a bit ironic , miller ?
ironic ?
i' m sorry kid , i never got over sixth grade .
i' il break it down for you , miller .
moments after you left the shop , someone powered up my machine .
with my arm in it .
i nearly got killed .
accidents happen .
it wasn' t an accident .
accidents happen out of negligence
this happened down the spike .
that' s some vocabulary you got kid .
spike .
it wields vengeance , vengeance means revenge miller .
i am sure you know what revenge means , don' t you ?
i am onto you miller .
despite your stupid jokes , you secretly balme me for the accident .
new car , huh ?
you despise me for it .
how did you get into my place ?
duplicate keys ? credit card ?
what ?
fuck you , miller !
this shit is gonna stop !
get off my property , punk !
bastards .
shit .
come on .
7 4 ... ... 3 c r
it' s 743cr .
what ?
shit .
fuck !
i' m sorry sir , but we don' t provide ... ... motor' s information to the general public .
i' m not just a memeber of the general public .
this guy is a friend of mine .
but you don' t know your firend' s address ?
we just met , i don' t know him that well .
sir , this is the dmv , not the dating service .
i just want talk to him .
i' m sorry sir , i can' t help you unless a crime has been committed .
has a crime been committed ?
please , i wouldn' t ask if it weren' t extremly important .
sorry sir .
no crime , no information .
what if i told you i was hit by this car ?
i don' t see any bruises .
if you did , would you give me an address ?
no , but the police might .
i want to report a hit and run .
bring it back when you are finished .
fill it out over there .
mr. reznik .
you sure about these plate numbers ?
743cr .
all right , that' s the one .
do you ever have a car stolen ?
no , what ?
cause the car that allegedly hit you was your own .
1969 , red pontiac viper registered to your name .
nearly a year ago you reported it as being totally wrecked .
do you know it is a felony to file a bogus police report ?
hey , wait a minute .
you got some explaining to do .
hey !
hey !
jesus , reznik .
just wanna talk to you .
hey come back .
reznik , reznik !
trevor ?
oh , no .
trevor , what do you want ?
trevor , it' s okay .
oh god , what happend ?
i was crossing the street .
lights changed on me .
did he stop ?
no , he just kept going .
he fucking hit my drivers man .
he gotta be hanged .
it was my fault .
i wasn' t paying attention .
trevor , we got get you to a hospital .
you may have some internal injuries . it is just bruises .
okay , you see this ?
this is a bruise , and this is a train wreck , alright ?
what is it with you and doctors ?
don' t you trust anyone ?
i trust you .
now i know .
you are crazy .
can i stay here tonight ?
babe , you can stay here every night .
you know that ?
what ?
what, babe , what' s going on in that crazy head of yours ?
i really want this to work , stevie
but ?
you know so little about me .
what if i turned into a warewolf or something ?
i will buy you a flea collar .
i love you .
stevie
yeah .
thanks .
i set out some clean cloth for you , your stuff is not dry yet .
you always keep men' s cloth lying around ?
some of my regulars .
they like to keep their clean change cloth here .
i probably just throw them out now , alright ?
hey , perfect fit .
yeah , whatever trevor .
i don' t have a size 26 waist here .
hey , how about that idea .
i can get a job selling man' s wear .
those chicks got paid vacations too .
i' il settle for that .
that' s not a bad life .
could be worse .
you know whatelse i want to do ?
i want to clean up this place , just get rid of all the fucking junk .
probably look like i' m a terrible housekeeper , which i sometimes am ... ... but i can also be very very , you know , organised and neat .
and i wanna do more of that .
i would love to paint a place .
just make it nice , just be organised , and neat and paint it white .
what i would also like is a decent stove .
this one is covered in fat .
just like a white , beautiful place and a decent stove .
not a lot to ask .
wow , don' t look so surprised .
a call girl scrambling eggs ...
yeah that' s funny , i dont think i ever cooked for a guy before .
not even my husband .
jesus christ .

just becuase i' m fucking you , isn' t it ?
now it all makes sense .
i' m fucking you , so he' s fucking me .

i don' t know what you are talking about , babe .
ah , don' t babe me .
yeah , babe .
i' il change my whole fucking life for you .
i' il do anything you want , babe .
you know what , i don' t deserve this .

fuck you !
you left it in my tip jar the other night .
bullshit .
i thought you wanted me to have it .
cut the crap , stevie .
what is a big deal about a goddamn picture ?
they said that the guy in the photo doesn' t exsit .
this says he does .
trevor , i don' t understand what the fuck you are talking about .
i' m talking about your ex !
ivan .

this guy standing next to you with a fish ?
i' m not in that photo .
trevor , i' m looking at a picture of you .
