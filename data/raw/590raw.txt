i have reached the watery depths .
the flood overwhelms me .
i am wearied with calling .
as we say farewell to our friend sam wheat , we are reminded of his kindness ... his generosity , his buoyancy of spirit .
all that we treasure ... our loved ones , our friends , our body , our mind ... are but on loan to us .
we must surrender them all .
we are all travelers on the same road , which leads to the same end .
as our loved one enters eternal life ,
let us remember that love , too , is eternal .
that although we will miss him , our love will light the void and dispel the darkness .

i' m holding her hand .

he says he loves you .
sam would never say that .

i mean , nothing .
now i can' t turn it off .
is this him ?
is this you ?
yeah .
yeah .
huh .
cute .
white , but cute .
what i don' t understand is , why did he come back ?
i don' t know .
why is he still here ?
he' s stuck , that' s what it is .
he' s in between worlds .
you know , it happens sometimes that the spirit gets yanked out so quick that the essence still feels it has work to do .
would you stop rambling ?
i' m just answering her question .
he' s got an attitude now .
i don' t have an attitude .
yes , you do have an attitude .
we' re having a little discussion .

don' t you take the lord' s name in vain .
would you relax ?
you relax .

goodbye .
molly , there is no one on earth besides you who wants this to be true more than me , but you got to be rational about this .
sam is no more in this room than ...
look , i understand the need to hang on to him ,
i really do , but this is absurd .
i know this seems absurd , but it had to be real .
you believed some fortune teller from brooklyn who shows up at your door ?
i watched her have a conversation with him .
i don' t buy it , moll , not for a minute .
what about the things she knew ?
what things ?
the photo sam took of me on our trip to reno .
carl , we were alone .
and the green underwear that i wrote my name in .

this is getting deranged .
we' re off the deep end .
she had a name and an address ...
willy lopez .
303 prospect place , apartment 4 d.
this is sick .
oh , carl .
this is really sick .
oh , god .
molly , i don' t understand how you could ... you could ... swallow this crap .
i mean ... this guy may not even exist .
maybe she' s just trying to use you to set someone up .
you' re right .
you' re absolutely right .
that' s what i got to find out .
what do you mean , find out ?
she said sam wants me to go to the police .
sam wants you to go to the police ?
jesus , moll .
are you out of your mind ?
what are you going to tell the police ?
that some storefront psychic has been communing with the dead ?
do you know what that sounds like ?
you' re talking ghosts here , for christ' s sake .
i' m sorry .
this stuff just really gets to me , you know ?
it' s ok if you don' t believe me .
i' m trying to , molly .
look ... if it' il make you feel any better ,
i' il go check this out , ok ?
i want you to try and get some sleep .
ok ?

be careful .
carl .
what the hell are you doing here ?
who you been talking to , willy ?
talking to " ?
what the hell do you mean ?
some woman knows all about you , everything .
where' s she getting it from ?
i haven' t said a word to anybody .
she knows your name and where you live .
a lot of women know where i live .
this is not a joke .
she knows about the murder .
i want you to find this bitch , whoever she is , and i want you to ...
just get rid of her , ok ?
i' ve got $4 million stuck in a god damn computer .
if i don' t get those codes , if that money is not transferred soon ...
i' m ... dead .
we' re both dead .
why not tell them you only launder money the first of the month ?
what the hell is wrong with you ?
is everything a joke ?
you killed a man .
you were supposed to steal his wallet .
was that a joke ?
i did you a favor .
that was a freebie .
look , these are drug dealers , ok ?
just don' t blow this for me .
i' ve risked my job .
i could go to jail . $80, 000 of that money is mine .
look , just ...
let me have the key to sam' s apartment .
i' il get the address book myself , ok ?
you god damn bastard !
why ?
why ?
you were my friend !
i had a life , god damn you .
i had a life !
look , i don' t even believe in this stuff myself .
but she was real .
you think i' d come down here if it wasn' t real ?
you know , you told me if i had any new information that i should come .
so here i am .
i know how this sounds .
i hear myself saying it , and i want to cringe .
but this woman knew things she couldn' t have known .
things sam only said to me .
ok , according to this psychic lady , there are ghosts and spirits all over the place watching us all the time ?
huh ?
hell , i' m never going to get undressed again .
excuse me .
i got more important things to do .
the guy' s name is willy lopez .
all i' m asking you to do is check it out .
ok .
wait here .
let me see if the guy' s got a record , all right ?
great .
what are you doing ?
where' s the file on willy lopez ?
there isn' t one .
he was probably some old boyfriend she was trying to get even with .
this psychic woman' s got a record that goes back a long way .
1967 ,
shreveport , forgery ... selling false i. d.
served one year , 1971 .
baton rouge , arrested for fraud .
numbers racketeering , served 10 months , 1974 .
look , this is impossible .
it goes on and on .
she knew things , private things .
now , how could she have known all that ?
a lot of times they read the obits .
she just had to see the word " banker " ... boom .
hell , they even go through your ... garbage to find things they can use ...
letters , old papers .
it doesn' t take much .
no .
it was real .
she knew about a ... a sweater i knitted .
and songs we sang .
our trip to montego bay .
i' m sorry .
i know this is hard .
people want so much to believe .
they' re grieving , they' re vulnerable ... and they will give anything for one last moment .
believe me .
these people know what they' re doing .
i know how you must feel , but you know you can press charges .
no .
thank you .
oh , god , let this be it .
yes .
hello .
eddie ?
it' s carl bruner .
what' s up ?
everything' s fine .
just , we' re all set .
let me know what you want me to do .

ok .
tomorrow at five minutes before closing , 3 : 55 p . m . , transfer the full account to the first island bank of nassau , registry number 486 9580 .

he' s a murderer .
hi .
hey .
i know it' s late .
i' m sorry to disturb you .
i' ve been thinking about you all day , and i feel really lousy about what happened last night .
this supernatural thing just ...
don' t worry about it .
it' s ok .
no , it' s not .
you needed me to hear you , and i didn' t .
i wasn' t there for you , and that was ... that was wrong .
it' s just , i ...
i just ...
i want you to know that i' m your friend .
thanks , carl .
you were never our friend .
that really means a lot to me .
me , too .
i brought you some japanese apple pears .
i know you like them .
thanks .
that' s very sweet .
could i come in for a second ?
it' s just been one of those days .
maybe some coffee ?
yeah .
come on in .
no , molly .
you seem a little tense .
are you ok ?
no .
i' m fine .
it' s just ...
what can i tell you ?
it' s been tough .
it just still hurts so much .
you lying snake .
and on top of it , it' s stuff at work .
they' ve given me my own accounts , which is good , but i just haven' t really had time to adjust , kind of absorb everything .
it' s no big deal .
yeah .
can i have just a little more cream ?
yeah .
oh , shit .
jesus .
i can' t believe i did that .
are you all right ?
yeah , i' m fine .
oh , god .
let me throw that in the washer .
don' t worry about it .
it' s ok .
it' s just ...
you want another shirt ?
no .
it' il dry .
it' il just take a minute .
there you go .
where were you today ?
i thought you were going to come into the bank and sign those papers ?
i was supposed to , but i didn' t have time .
i went to the police .
you did ?
wow .
what did you tell them ?
what did they say ?
it was awful .
i felt really stupid .
they brought out a file on this woman and ...
at least 10 inches thick .
a ripoff artist , huh ?
no , molly .
you know , the sad thing ... is that i believed her .
molly ... sometimes we need to believe .
why ?
what' s the point ?
molly , it' s not easy to face the realities of life sometimes .
you got to give yourself that .
what you' ve got to remember is the love that you guys felt .
you got to remember how good sam was .
you were everything to him , molly .
you were his life .
i feel so alone .
you' re not alone .
ok ?
you got your work .
you' re incredibly talented .
you' re young .
you' re fantastically gorgeous .
i don' t know what' s real anymore .
i don' t know what to think .
just think about sam .
think about the time you guys had together .
how wonderful that was .
yeah .
let your feelings out , moll .
it' s ok .
life turns on a dime .
you know ?
i mean ... people think that ... they' re there forever , that there' s always going to be tomorrow , but that' s bullshit .
sam taught us that .
you have to live for now .
for today .
i can' t .
i' m sorry .
it' s ok .
l ...

i can' t .
it' s just too soon .
