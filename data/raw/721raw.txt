the only time i ever leave my cul de sac is when jon takes me to the vet ... which he' s been doing a lot recently , and it appears to have nothing to do with me .
jon must want to go for his own reason .
well , there' s nothing wrong with garfield .
he' s just a happy , fat , lazy cat .
no need for a second opinion .
well , i worry about him .
i know you do .
ooh !

betty , today , why don' t you start me off with a swedish massage ... a manicure and a pedicure , okay ?
seaweed wrap , loofah ... belly rub , uh ... tail waxing and then crack my toes to finish .
jon , there' s something important i need to ask you .
something that i wouldn' t ask most guys who come in here .
wait , no .
i think i know where this is going .
you do ?
i do .
liz , i' ve wanted to ask you the same thing for a very long time .
are you sure that we' re talking about the same thing ?
absolutely .
yeah , uh , i' ve never been more sure of anything in my entire life .

he needs to be loved .
well , thank you .
thank you very much , ladies and gentlemen .
no , maybe not in my neighborhood .
hey , boomer , i really gotta run .
gotta fly , everybody .
really , please , stay behind the security fences .
so great of you to come out to see me ... but i' ve got somebody waiting for me , very devoted , almost crippled .
no , please , don' t cry .
i know what it' s like to be unloved .
well , you do .
i' il try to come back and visit , and if i don' t , i' il try to write .
bye bye .
does anybody know this guy ?
bye bye , everybody .
garfield is leaving the building .
jon , you know you don' t have to do this if you don' t want to .
no .
no , it' s okay .
some part of me always wanted to know what it' d be like ... to have a pet that actually wants to play with you .
you' re a good friend .
one question ...
am i still gorgeous ?
jon , i think we got a little problem here .
uh , jon ...
i can help the transition go smoothly .
jon , it' s in my seat .
jon . !

garfield , this is odie .
he' s coming home with us .
whoa !
you went in there to get a date and came out with a dog ?
oh , that' s bad even for you .
oh , you' re so sad !
oh , no , no , no .
we' re not bringing a dog home with us .
hey , i ride shotgun !

please .
come on , odie .
let' s go .
this is your new home .
come on , buddy .
jon , you had me , a chick magnet ... and now you' ve got a tick magnet .
garfield , jon brought a dog home .
i am aware , nermal .
why would he do a thing like that ?
gee , i don' t know , nermal .
it just seems like a weird thing to do ... bringing a dog into a house that already has a cat .
can we drop it ?
i mean , it' s no big ... deal .
it' s ... just a splattered bug on the windshield of my life .
a bug ?
a dim witted , smelly , goofy ...
splattered bug that i will deal with appropriately and enthusiastically .
come on .
as you can see , i' m stilljon' s favorite .
see ya later , garfield .
good luck with the bug thing !
come on .
this is payback for the liver thing , isn' t it ?
payback .
he' s a nut .
this is your new home , odie .
that' s my office over there .
and , uh , the tv over there .
and , uh , the kitchen .
hm .
you wanna go see it ?
okay , go see the house .
go see it .
why don' t you draw him a map ?
okay , i' ve gotta ... remain calm , that' s all .
jon' s a cat guy , not a dog guy .
this' il last a week , maybe 10 days .

hey , what do you say we play brain surgeon ?

he' s trying to tear us apart .
don' t you see that ?

i was provoked , pushed , prodded , driven mad .
you can' t kick me out of my own house like i' m some kind of animal !
oh , come on , jon .
jon !
oh , come on , jon .

you know , a puppy needs a little tough love every now and then .
i think it builds character .
hello , pooky .
miss me ?
you know what ?
i' m gonna make it up to odie tomorrow .
i' m going to teach him how to drink out of the toilet .
poor odie .
that cat is such a pig .
garfield' s a pig ?
you never put the dog out at night .
why not ?
because dogs ... run away .
sure , jon , i' il eat all your lasagna for you .
oh , look .
what do we have here ?
you' re a lost dog .
well , we can fix that .
oh , do i feel good this morning .
i slept like a fat cat .
hey , tall , dark and human , what' s for breakfast ?
odie !
where are you , boy ?
well , relax .
uh , i think he was going to camp out .
odie ?
well , he probably had a sleepover at luca' s , i think .
odie !
odie ?
hm .
well , maybe he' s fetching the paper for the neighbors .
where is that silly dog ?
i can' t go on like this anymore , wendell .
i' ve got to get a dog .
i think that' s a lovely idea .
i know you' ve been sad and lonely since the divorce , and i' ve tried to be a friend ...
not for me , you imbecile .
for the act .
if i could get my hands on a really talented dog ... wouldn' t walterj .
just choke on his emmy ?
like odie ?
yeah .
yeah , now he was good .
oh , yeah .
you know , he was kinda dopey looking and spry .
and ...
lost !
hmm ?
hi , it' s jon .
i was just calling to see if odie' s been over there .
my name is jon arbuckle , and , um , i can' t find my dog .
i' ve looked all around the neighborhood , and i can' t find him .
i saw him last night , but i haven' t seen him this morning .
and , uh , if you see him , give me a call , please .
uh , i was calling to see if you' d seen odie ?
um , i think he' s run away .
i was giving him a bath , and i forgot to put his collar back on .
you know , ' cause garfield hates his collar .
he' s about 15 pounds .
he' s brownish yellow with brown floppy ears .
would you mind getting that ?
um , i' m offering a reward .
yeah , that' s right .

the one thing you can' t do is tell her the dog' s gone .
i gotta tell her .

he got out last night .
i feel terrible .
i called the pound .
i put up posters .
i looked everywhere , but i can' t find him .
why didn' t you just tell me ?
i guess i figured ... he was the only reason you were spending time with me .
come on .
no , i' m serious .
i mean , i thought ...

let' s go find him .

and to do it , you cast odie out into the cold , cruel world ?
we saw how you locked odie outside last night .
oh , i don' t believe you guys .
i didn' t know he was gonna run away .
he' s a dumb dog .
no offense , luca .
uh , what ?
you can' t blame me for that .
any one of us could be next .
yeah .
there' s no room for anybody else in garfield' s world .
huh ?
oh , that' s a little dramatic .
well , i may have been a little tough about protecting my turf ... but , uh , i don' t hate the guy .
i understand happy has a big surprise for us .
