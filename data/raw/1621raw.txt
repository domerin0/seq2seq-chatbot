father can go by himself .
please , mother .
by himself ?
your father is a brave man .
but he' s going to need the special kiss to face his colleagues tonight .
father ?
brave ?
there are many different kinds of bravery .
there' s the bravery of thinking of others before oneself .
now , your father has never brandished a sword nor fired a pistol , thank heavens .
but he' s made many sacrifices for his family ... and put away many dreams .
where did he put them ?
he put them in a drawer .
and sometimes , late at night , we take them out and admire them .
<i>but it gets harder and harder</ i> <i>to close the drawer . </ i>
he does .
and that is why he is brave .
and remember , every cloud has a silver lining .

wendy ?
one girl is worth more than 20 boys .

i live with boys ... the lost boys .
they are well named .
who are they ?
children who fall out of their prams when the nurse is not looking .
if they are not claimed in seven days , they are sent to the neverland .
are there girls too ?
girls are much too clever to fall out of their prams .
peter , it is perfectly lovely the way you talk about girls .
i should like to give you ... a ... kiss .
don' t you know what a kiss is ?
i shall know when you give me one .
i suppose i' m to give you one now .

so i ran away to kensington gardens and i met tink .

i had never thought of it that way .
<i>[ tinker bell chattering ] </ i>
<i>i suppose i did . </ i>
how wonderful .
<i>[ wendy ] </ i>
<i>my parents wanted me to grow up . </ i>
growing up is such a barbarous business , full of inconvenience and pimples .
things were simpler when i was younger .
and then the mess starts , the feelings come .
pan is so lucky to be untroubled by them .
oh , no .
he cannot love .
<i>it' s part of the riddle</ i> <i>ofhis being . </ i>
cigar ?
oh , there , there .
shh , shh , shh .
tsk , tsk , tsk .
it doesn' t have to be this way .
didst thou ever want to be a pirate , my hearty ?
i once thought of calling myself ...
mm ?
red handed jill .
oh , what a marvelous name !
that' s what we' il call you if you join us .
but what would my duties be ?
i could not be expected to pillage .
do you , um , by any chance , tell stories ?
<i>[ wendy ] </ i>
<i>and they all lived happily ... </ i> <i>ever ... after . </ i>
bravo !
<i>bravissimo . ! </ i>
might i have time to consider your generous offer ?
absolutely .
of course , you must .
my fellows will return you whence they found you .
none of my crew will follow you .
i swear it .
my new obsession is you , not dear peter pan or his whereabouts .
what would mother think of my becoming a pirate ?
until we meet again .

red handed jill ?
she sounds quite fearsome !
<i>fearsome ? </ i>

red handed jill may be a brave swordsman .
a girl like her ?
brave or not , i shall run her through !
<i>[ all cheering ] </ i>

' tis true , john .
your sister has been invited to piracy .
<i>[ boy ] </ i>
<i>but , mother , hook is a fiend . </ i>

on the contrary ,
i find captain hook to be a man of feeling .
mother and father are fighting again .
sir , you are both ungallant and deficient .
how am i deficient ?
you' re just a boy .
are you really to be a pirate , mother ?
no .
we are going home .
