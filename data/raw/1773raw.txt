the current spell of icy weather has claimed its first victim .
a motorcyclist froze to death on highway 4 and drove for a further 90 km after he was dead .
two patrolmen flagged him down and as he didn' t react they pursued him .
they drove alongside and rebuked him for his attitude .
as he didn' t move they realized something was wrong .
it seems incredible .
it' s a wonderful image .
a dead young man drives his motorcycle across the icy plain , escorted by two patrolmen .
where was he going in that icy dawn ?
to see someone who couldn' t wait until the morning .
there' s a story here !
i' il cut it out and keep it , it might inspire me .
i' il get it .

the visit " .
ever since we started touring with the show " the bomb
i' ve been waiting for this moment .

my lips are wearing out !
i drank too much .

a lottery ticket .
i' il keep that .

he' s not bad .
and look , he' s still hard !

you' ve been at him for hours .

come on , the bike won' t run away .

now you get a hard on , asshole !
it' s not fair !
enrique serrano !
enrique !
paquito !
come up here !
what about the bike ?
leave it there .
come up .
there' s nothing like loading up on drugs and hormones to end up as crazy as you , bitch .
the keys !
we' re not stealing the bike !
why not ?
we' ve got a buyer .
i' il explain later .
i' il meet you at the mass .
so we' re going to the school ? yes , now more than ever .
i' m flipping out , bitch !
i bet you are .
dear enrique , it' s me , ignacio .
i' ve dreamed so much of this moment !
years have gone by but i' ve never forgotten you .
we have to meet again , but when you' re not drunk .
i want to tell you about my life and hear about yours while we eat a cream cake in the mallol patisserie ,
like when we got out of school on weekends .
i' m not going to complicate your life .
i know you' re married and have a child .
i know that you live in the next town , that you' re broke and that i' d like to help you .
right now , i' m working on something , but i' il explain it all in the patisserie .
i' il wait for you from 6 : 00 to 7 : 00 .
do come !
i adore you .
ignacio .
yes ?
i miss you .
have you unpacked all the boxes ?
not even half of them .
do you need a hand ?
i don' t mind , really .
it' s best if you don' t , martn .
thanks .
can i call you later ?
i' m reading .
oh , do forgive me .
don' t be so fucking touchy !
i' il call you in a while .
do that , even if it' s late .
we saw sara' s first films here .
and " breakfast at tiffany' s " .
enrique and i groped each other for the first time here .
my knees are trembling just thinking about it .
i' m meeting him at 6 : 00 in the patisserie .
don' t get your hopes up .
remember , he' s married .
if father manolo hadn' t separated us ...
what' s he got to do with it ?
a lot , everything !
that priest owes me a lot and it' s time for him to pay .
i hate seeing you like this .
you got anything left ?
yes .
what ?
cocaine .
c' mon , let' s have some !
here ?
of course .
no one' s out in the streets yet .
oh , fag !
come on .
a nailful for my gal paca .
one more .
i believe in couples . two fucks , two bumps , two " amigas
two rode together " , " two for the road " .
you' re such a pig !
right , let' s go to school !
gee up , girl !
come on , best foot forward .
this was my school .
i' m worn out .
do you have anything left ?
be quiet .
it has started .
the god of hope who , by the grace of the holy spirit , fills us with his joy and peace ...
that' s father manolo .
he looks so old !
well he' s no chicken .
i guess .
zahara , this is crazy !
are you backing out , bitch ?
no , but the chapel is so tiny , there' s no place to hide .
when he sees us appear , he' il do what christ did to the buyers in the temple .
he drove them out with a whip , and he was christ !
so this man who , according to you , is so imperfect ...
i confess to god , the father almighty , and to you , my brethren , that i have sinned through thought , word , deed and omission .
through my fault .
through your fault .
through my fault .
through your fault .
through my most grievous fault .
so i beseech the blessed mary , ever virgin , the angels , the saints , and you , my brethren , to intercede for me before our lord god .
almighty god , have mercy on us , forgive us our sins and lead us to eternal life .
through jesus christ our lord .
we' il see ...
the lord be with you .
i could use him .
may the blessing of almighty god ,
father , son and holy spirit descend upon you .
you may go in peace .
i hope so .
go back to the dormitory and sleep a bit more .
thank you , father .
if i' m in the sacristy for too long , don' t wait .
we' il meet at the hostel for lunch , sweetheart .
cute !
divine !
good morning , father manolo .
what do you want ?
you can' t come in here !
i' m the sister of an ex pupil , ignacio rodrguez .
you still can' t come in here !
don' t you remember ignacio ?
we' ve had a lot of pupils .
but no one like ignacio , i' m sure .
i' ve brought an important message from him .
he can give it to me himself .
he can' t .
he died in an accident .
i' m sorry .
now , please go .
go away !
hide !
i' ve got it all !
hide , he' s coming !
ignacio ...
i told you to leave !
what are you doing here ?
the same as you , remembering ignacio .
get out !
we have to talk , father .
it' il only take a minute .
say what you have to say and go !
are we going to talk in the dark ?
i don' t mind .
i' m used to working in the dark .
what do you want ?
a better life and a better body .
what do i have to do with those improvements ?
you can help me finance them .
i don' t believe ignacio is dead or that you' re his sister .
i don' t even believe you' re a woman .
are you locking me in ?
i don' t want anyone coming in by mistake .
and now , tell me why you' re here !
ok .
i' il get to the point .
it' s a story by ignacio .
yes , he took your advice and kept on writing .
i' ve got a friend , a pig , who works at " diario 16 " .
he' s very interested in publishing this story .
but first i' d like your opinion .
apart from being ignacio' s literature teacher you' re one of the main characters in this story .
read this .
each month , the boys who got on the honors board , that is , the ones who got the best grades , were rewarded with a day in the country .
we were always accompanied by our literature teacher ,
father manolo .
moon river , always on my mind .
i won' t be swept away by the water , the muddy water of that moon river as it flows along .
river and moon , tell me where to find my god , and good and ill .
tell me .
i' m longing to know what is hidden in the dark and you' il find it ...
no !
lgnacio !
lgnacio !
a trickle of blood divided my forehead in two .
i had a feeling the same thing would happen with my life .
it would always be divided and i couldn' t help it .
open the door , father .
it is i.
what is it ?
there' s been a robbery .
where ?
in the chapel .
i think it was after your mass .
were you missing anything ?
no .
the chalice , the paten , the jug , the cruets ...
they must be found !
the boys mustn' t hear about this .
very well .
and no one is to bother me , except you .
was that father jos ?
ignacio hated him .
does he still hit the pupils ?
he never lad a hand on ignacio .
that was the principal' s privilege .
to sum up , i want a million in cash .
or else " diario 16 " will publish the whole story .
i don' t have a million pesetas , much less in cash .
but you can get it .
now , if you don' t mind , i' m leaving .
i' ve said all i had to say .
but keep reading , it gets better .
the key .
wait .
wait until after break time .
it' il just be a minute .
so you came to blackmail me .
tell ignacio he' s overrating these pages .
they' re garbage !
garbage is hot !
you and i make a best selling couple .
and the editor of " diario 16 " knows that .
you' re in no position to threaten anyone .
people will believe me , not you .
no , people have changed .
this is 1977 .
this society puts my freedom above your hypocrisy .
if we treated ignacio so badly , why did he come back ?
why didn' t he report us or change schools ?
he came back ' cause he' d fallen in love , with a classmate .
enrique serrano .
remember him ?
yes .
do you mind if i keep reading ?
there were lots of celebrations at school .
the most important one was principal' s day .
that day , there were sports competitions and religious acts , and we had a special meal .
come with me , ignacio .
come along !
i haven' t finished .
you' il sing better that way .
do you know the new words ?
yes , i' ve got the crib father manolo gave me .
call him reverend principal .
he' s the school principal from today .
i know .
don' t answer back .
when you' re singing , keep looking at him , as if there were no one else in the dining room .
do you understand ?
yes .
father jos , placed me in the center of the dining room .
i felt odd in front of all those priests drinking and eating , and i was a bit scared , but they all looked at me kindly , except father manolo , who looked ready to cry .
and now ,
father jos manuel , as a birthday gift ,
ignacio is going to sing one of your favorite songs .
torna a sorrento " .
the new words , " gardener " , were written by father jos manuel , helped by my humble self .
when you' re ready , ignacio .
gardener , gardener , night and day among your flowers , setting fire to their colors with the flame of your love .
and you place in every calyx the smile of your yearning , with your eyes turned up to heaven where all your hopes reside .
and your flowers , gardener , with their corollas burning brightly join together in gratitude and embalm you with their scent .
continue with your labor , cultivating all the flowers entrusted to your love by the lord .
i thought you didn' t like me .
no , just the opposite !
but every time i looked at you , you looked away .
because you made me nervous .
and now i don' t ?
no .
come in .
may i help you ?
don' t you recognize me , mother ?
has the world changed me so much ?
mother soledad !
what are you doing here ?
i' ve come to stay .
to stay ?
sara is so beautiful !
in this house ?
no .
never
it' s been a long time .
who can remember if i did something i shouldn' t have ?
it' s impossible .
it is not god who rejects you .
it is i , in the name of my order .
what' s wrong ?
i can' t sleep .
neither can i.
what we did in the cinema wasn' t right .
i liked it .
so did i.
but i think it was a sin , and god' s going to punish us .
god ?
i don' t believe in god .
what do you believe in ?
i' m a hedonist .
what' s that ?
people who like having fun .
i read it in an encyclopedia .
what' s the matter ?
you hear that ?
father manolo !
open the door !
or must i break it down and let the whole school know what you' re doing ?
lgnacio !
i know you' re in there !
i' ve seen your feet .
i can hear you breathing .
lgnacio !
we' re not doing anything !
get out !
i' il deal with you later !
i' m not leaving ignacio alone with you .
how dare you !
get out of here immediately !
enrique , please .
do as he says .
come here .
what were you doing in there ?
nothing .
nothing ?
i swear , father .
then why was the door locked ?
come along .
come with me to the chapel .
the bell !
what are you thinking of ?
i think i' ve just lost my faith at this moment , so i no longer believe in god or hell .
as i don' t believe in hell i' m not afraid , and without fear i' m capable of anything .
we' il forget this , ignacio .
even if i wanted to , i can' t stay angry with you .
but promise that what happened tonight won' t happen again .
and enrique ?
what about him ?
will he be punished ?
i should expel him !
i' m sure he was responsible for it all .
no , i was .
don' t cry .
he' s a very bad influence on you .
i want what' s best for you .
if you don' t expel him i' il do what you want .
hush .
i sold myself for the first time in that sacristy to avoid enrique being expelled .
but father manolo tricked me .
i swore that one day i' d make him pay for that .
on your feet !
hands behind your head !
and , one !
change !
change !
change !
change !
change !
change !
hurry up , enrique !
we' il miss the bus !
change !
change !
i' m happy you came !
you' re better without the beard .
thank you .
what are you doing ?
i' m re reading your story .
didn' t you like it the first time ?
of course .
just look at it .
i couldn' t help making notes .
force of habit .
that' s ok , it' s your copy .
thanks .
right , well ...
how can i put this ?
i think there' s a good film in this story and i' d like to direct it .
really ?
you' re not kidding me ?
i never joke about work .
but first , tell me how much you want for the rights ?
what rights ?
the story is yours !
do what you fucking want with it !
so you really liked it ?
i admit that when you said it was based on our childhood
i felt a bit apprehensive .
but i was very touched .
i' m so happy , man .
remember i' m an actor and i want out of bumblebee .
yes , i know that .
you' d be perfect as enrique serrano , naked on the bed , with zahara' s letter on the pillow .
enrique serrano ?
i think i' d rather play zahara .
zahara , you ?
you' re crazy !
why ?
well ...
you' re too well built .
you' re not right .
martn , we' ve got our story !
i can slim down !
i can get into the part !
i' m used to that in the theater .
like robert de niro ...
make a photocopy .
the visit " ?
yes .
ignacio and i are starting on the script .
if you' re going to direct it , it' s best if you write it yourself .
all right , ignacio .
ngel !
start calling me ngel , or you' il never get used to it .
ngel .
do you mind driving ?
i' m a bit shaky .
i' m surprised you can even walk , with all you' ve taken .
we had to celebrate , right ?
i thought we' d be talking about the project .
we' il talk later .
we' ve got time .
remember ?
remember what ?
nothing .
you' re really high .
what should i remember ?
nothing .
turn off here .
is all this yours ?
no , no way .
i' ve just rented it .
don' t be too impressed , it' s a mess inside .
how about a swim ?
it would do you good .
how' s the water ?
it' s waiting for you .
will you pass me a cigarette ?
you weren' t serious about playing zahara , were you ?
totally .
i don' t joke about work either .
then let' s not talk about work .
what are you doing ?
sleeping here or going back to madrid ?
if you want , i' il stay .
but talking about bodies , if i look too manly i can slim down .
i' m very flexible , i can do anything .
you disconcert me , ngel .
you told me that already .
and you told me about slimming down .
why don' t we just talk clearly ?
i can' t say it any more clearly1
i' m an actor .
i spent three fucking years doing shit with bumblebee .
this is my first chance to get a terrific part and i won' t let it slip away .
you can' t do zahara .
not at first sight , but give me time !
you' re a good director , and i' il do anything !
you just have to trust both of us .
i' ve tried .
but i can' t trust you .
why ?
i just can' t recognize the ignacio i knew at school .
the one who loved " cuore matto " and so many other things .
my tastes have changed .
is that what bothers you ?
no .
people change with time .
not you .
simply , you' re not ignacio .
who the fuck are you to decide who i am or who i' m not ?
how dare you ?
why am i not ignacio ?
because i don' t remember a song from years ago ?
apart from that .
because i' m not sucking your dick ?
if i' d stayed like the kid you knew , i' d be dead now .
i already am .
dead tired .
i' m going to bed .
what are you doing ?
i don' t know .
you tell me .
tell you what ?
if i' m going to play zahara .
does your staying depend on that ?
no !
but if i don' t play zahara there' s no film .
then i don' t know why you' re here , cockteaser .
get out !
why the hell did i decide to see you again , fucking faggot !
a woman threw herself into a pool of hungry crocodiles in a zoo that was crowded with visitors at the time .
when the first crocodile attacked , the woman hugged it , according to the witness .
the crocodiles devoured the body of the woman , who never complained , in a few minutes .
what a horrible death !
well ...
she didn' t even open her mouth .
what' s on your mind ?
hungry crocodiles .
hello .
hello , come in .
it' s the journalist .
why are you here ?
ton interview me ?
no .
well , yes .
which is it , cutie ?
i' m not a journalist , i' m an actor .
and i' d like you to help me prepare a character .
what character ?
a tranny who imitates sara montiel , among others .
that' s me !
why don' t they give me the part ?
well , you' re not an actor , you' re just a faggot .
what you have to learn is how to be polite , because that' s no way to treat a lady !
i' m sorry .
so will you teach me ?
and how will you pay me , honey ?
that' s what i' m looking for !
two minutes .
we' il talk later .
i' m on now .
everything you do is great for me .
i' m delighted .
see you later .
ortigueira , 6 kilometers .
hello .
hello .
what can i get you ?
a beer .
forgive me for asking , but how did you get that lighter ?
you' re not from here .
i stole it from a friend .
his family lives here .
maybe you know him .
his name is ngel andrade .
yes .
that' s his stage name .
sure , i know him .
you do ?
yes , very well .
that' s great .
who is it ?
enrique .
i was at school with ignacio .
go away or i' il call the police !
excuse me .
are you enrique goded ?
yes .
i' m ignacio' s mother .
i' m delighted to meet you .
come in .
thank you .
forgive my sister in law .
i' ve got the heart problem , but she' s the one who gets scared .
it doesn' t matter .
ignacio talked a lot about you .
we were very good friends .
i know .
the last time he came to see me he wrote you a letter .
a letter ?
i never got it .
it was three years ago .
he didn' t know your address , he sent it to the ministry of culture .
then i' m not surprised .
by the time it was returned , he was dead .
let' s go into the dining room .
that' s my son juan .
then younger boy .
he' s in the theater .
he' s changed his name .
he says there are too many juans .
he wants even me to call him ngel .
i' d like to see ignacio' s room .
to be honest , he didn' t really have a room .
but when he came he liked to use the attic .
would you like to see it ?
we' re going upstairs !
juan burned everything .
the notebooks , the clothes ...
all except those magazines .
there' s nothing left of what ignacio wrote ?
no .
what a pity !
are you from a publisher too ?
no .
what publisher ?
soon after ignacio died , a man came who was in charge of publishing young authors ,
or so he said .
he was desperate to get his hands on ignacio' s stories .
do you remember his name , or the publisher' s ?
no , but he was very insistent .
so i told the truth , that juan had burned everything , and he even asked for juan' s address .
i gave him a false one , of course .
i think that man was half mad .
this is ignacio' s letter .
it didn' t get burned because i never told juan it had been returned .
thank you , ma' am .
don' t judge my juan .
he' s a good son , but his brother' s death really hit him .
he was the one who found him .
dear enrique .
at last i' ve got news of you .
i read it in the papers .
you' ve directed your first film , man .
even if it was underground .
and to think i was the film buff !
you' il be pleased to hear i' m still writing .
i' m enclosing a story that would make a divine film .
father manolo inspired it .
it' s incredible , but i ran into him the other day in valencia .
i' m visiting my mother now , but i live in valencia .
i' ve checked up , he isn' t a priest anymore .
he calls himself by his last name , berenguer .
he works in a publisher' s , he' s married and has a son .
he' s crying out to be blackmailed !
so i wrote " the visit " , the story i' m sending you .
read it , please .
at this point in my life , i need a lot of money and i' m going to get it from that fucker !
he owes me a lot , and it' s time for him to pay .
write to me and i' il tell you the rest of the story .
all i' m asking is to hear from you .
i can only share this story with you .
i love you .
your ignacio .
i' il get it .
what do you want ?
i' ve come to apologize .
i' il give you your shorts .
you left them behind .
thank you .
i' m very sorry about what i said .
i take it all back .
if you' re still interested , " the visit " is yours .
do it with whomever and however you want .
have you lost weight ?
yes .
i' m really working on it .
i want to lose even more .
and i' m taking classes .
classes in what ?
in how to be a queen .
i' m working with the best sara montiel impersonator .
she performs at " bambola " , a gay club .
i' m workin as a waiter there . so i can study the queens more closely .
then you' re still thinking about zahara .
yes .
just let me do an audition .
thank you .
you had it !
yes , you left that behind too .
ignacio , i' d like to talk ...
until you call me ngel ,
i won' t believe you' re taking me seriously .
ngel , i' m sure you' re a good actor , now more than ever .
so you' il let me audition ?
the audition worked for several months ,
long enough for me to throw myself into the shooting of " the visit " ,
like the woman who threw herself to the crocodiles and hugged them as they ate her .
you' ve changed the ending .
yes .
the visit " can' t end happily , like your story .
why not ?
zahara can' t just walk out of the school .
she' s a threat to the priests .
and we know what the church is capable of .
but this ending is really heavy , man .
for you , as an actor , it' s much more intresting .
you think so ?
of course .
i shot " the visit " as a homage to ignacio .
in his letter , he' d said he' d love to see it on the screen .
and also to discover the enigma of juan .
he allowed me to penetrate him frequently , but only physically .
we were about to finish shooting and his mystery was still intact .
but on the last day we had a visit .
silence !
and ... roll camera !
rolling !
the visit " 91 , 1 , first take .
zahara , darling !
action !
the boys are in class and i' m sick of arguing .
let me out !
do you want to kidnap me ?
open the door !
i have to take a piss , buy cigarettes , get a fix !
even if i got the money , how can i be sure you won' t blackmail me again ?
you' il never be sure .
that' s my revenge .
let me out or i' il scream .
i loved ignacio .
you don' t love a boy of ten .
you harass him , you abuse him !
i loved him .
please , let me out !
i' m locked in !
she' s threatening to denounce us .
she wants a million pesetas to keep quiet .
if you give her a single peseta , you' il never stop paying .
i knew we' d meet again , scum !
you know her ?
you knew him much better than i did .
it' s ignacio rodrguez .
ignacio !
it can' t be !
we have to finish him off .
he' s a threat to the whole congregation !
he wants to say something .
yes , that we let him do .
if you' re going to kill me ,
i' d like to confess first .
confess what ?
thanks to you we' ve got no way out .
you have to stay calm .
i' il get rid of the body .
how ?
it' s best if you know nothing .
it was self defense , father .
he' d have made our lives impossible .
yes ,
i guess so .
and there are no witnesses .
god .
yes , but he' s on our side .
cut !
we' ve cut , guys !
this one' s good .
what about the other one ?
give me no .
1 as well .
well done , guys .
no , it was great .
is anything wrong , ngel ?
no .
i' il see you later .
it went really well .
put that down !
who are you ?
the villain in your film .
father manolo !
mr. berenguer .
i' m not even a father to my own son now .
get out !
i read in a magazine that you were here .
go and drink some hot milk with honey , and take an aspirin , and leave me alone .
i' ve got a lot to do , i can' t waste time on you .
not even to find out how ignacio died ?
or who killed him ?
and if it concedes with your film ?
say what you have to say and go .
i was living valencia .
i worked for a publisher that promoted young writers .
three years ago , i received a story called " the visit " , signed by ignacio rodrguez .
ignacio rodrguez calling about the new writers anthology .
didn' t you tell him he was rejected ?
yes , but he insists on speaking to you .
he' s on your line .
mr. jos manuel berenguer ?
yes .
i preferred father manolo .
excuse me ?
are you the author of " the visit " ?
yes .
we decided not to include it in " short stories of the 80s
i' m sorry .
you and i have to talk .
i think not .
i' ve got nothing more to say .
but i do .
i went to st. john' s school .
you were my literature teacher , and you were madly in love with me .
i remember how you' d embrace me from behind while you declared your love .
i can' t believe you' ve forgotten .
i remember the buttons on your sauterne digging into my backbone .
have you really forgotten ?
i' il expect you at my house at 7 : 00 .
my address is on the back of the envelope , father manolo .
push the door .
it' s just stuck .
that wasn' t the ignacio you and i loved .
hello , mr. berenguer .
i' m ignacio .
please , come in .
yes , i' m a junkie , but i want to quit and i thought you could help me .
well , i know a clinic .
so do i , but first i want to fix myself up a bit .
i know i' ve got divine tits , but everything else ...
anyway , i won' t get into that .
looking pretty costs a lot of money , father manolo .
i think a million would do it .
a million ?
yes , in cash , and my lips are sealed .
i won' t say a word .
you' re out of your mind !
sexual harassment is frowned upon , father manolo .
what would your wife think , or your boss ?
you' re in no position to blackmail anyone .
i could have you arrested tonight .
very well .
you call the police , i' il call your wife and the media .
a blackmailer can' t be as defenseless as you are .
believe me , i know what i' m saying .
juan , go back to your room .
i want to watch tv .
watch it later , we' re talking business .
i don' t mind if he stays .
i' m sure you don' t .
he' s my brother , he' s looking after me .
or that' s my mother' s idea .
i' m mr. berenguer .
one million , end of story .
do you want me to call him juan , or ngel ?
the blackmail became an investment for me .
i visited the brothers frequently so i could keep seeing juan .
remember don narciso , the nazi ?
he love my illustrations .
look at this one .
and there' s another one ...
look , this is beautiful .
and this one ...
children of spain
i brought you this .
i kept ignacio happy with small amounts of money .
and i kept stalling him .
i desired juan , more and more every day .
hello .
hello .
you brought the dough ?
i can only give you 50, 000 .
you said you' d bring the million !
i said they' d tell me today if i' d get the loan .
they said yes , but they have to check my guarantees .
i need another three weeks .
another three weeks !
i' m a junkie .
haven' t you noticed ?
i could be dead in three weeks .
are you going away ?
obviously !
i want to see my mother before i check in .
she has to see me with these teeth and this face , and it' s your fault !
don' t be unfair , ignacio , i' m doing what i can .
then do more !
i' il be gone for a week .
when i come back i want that million .
if you don' t have it , you' il be sorry .
i' m sick of being put off !
i' il try to hurry them up , but ...
father .
come along .
shall i help you ?
sure , take the olivetti , it' s the heaviest .
while you' re at it , take this one too .
stop that taxi .
taxi .
bye , father .
goodbye .
open the trunk , please .
my scarf !
excuse me .
i' ve come for my scarf .
i must have left it here .
fuck , it' s really soft !
silk .
it' s yours .
to be honest , i left it here for you .
cut it out , i' m not ignacio !
fortunately .
what time is it ?
12 : 30 .
did he give you anything for me ?
ignacio ?
no .
fuck !
i had to pay my school fees today .
are you studying ?
yes .
drama .
i' m an actor .
selfish bastard !
he knew i had to pay today and he didn' t give me anything .
obviously , i paid his fees .
i hadn' t told ignacio but the bank had granted me a loan of two million .
i withdrew the first million .
i told my wife i was going to a conference abroad .
she didn' t believe me .
i guess that doesn' t interest you .
not in the least .
how did ignacio die ?
the week juan and i spent alone was the happiest in my life .
every day i bought him something .
clothes , a walkman , a super 8 camera .
i enjoyed the gifts more than he did .
take off your shirt .
take it off !
now it' s my turn !
now , take that off .
show me your cock .
if you' re going to shoot my dick , don' t show my face !
too late .
i can' t ... !
you !
give me some dough !
i' ve got the fucking sweats .
how' s mom ?
she had another heart attack .
but she' s all right now .
i' m the one who' s sick .
the dough !
more !
that' s all i have .
i want that million now !
no more excuses !
no more stalling and no more gifts .
mom !
how are you , juan ?
has ignacio arrived ?
yes ! what happened this time ?
the usual thing , son , but ...
he stole my pension , and i' d just gotten it !
is that true ?
yes , love , it is .
tell auntie i' il send her some money .
he promised me he was going into a clinic .
and you believed him ?
yes , this time he really means it .
he' s going to try .
you have to help him .
how ?
by being with him .
don' t leave him .
promise me .
i promise .
listen , did he give you the cheese and the chorizos ?
delicous !
why did you bother ?
there' s food in valencia .
don' t spend your money .
they' re your favorites .
i' d kept them for you .
you can' t get them in valencia .
all right , thanks .
lots of love , son .
yes , call me if anything happens .
don' t worry , i will .
bye .
where' s ignacio ?
i' m going to kill him !
it was juan' s idea .
or mine , i don' t know .
the only solution was to get rid of him .
more or less what you' ve just shot .
but not as violent .
how did you think of it ?
ignacio' s story doesn' t end like that .
while i was adapting it , i found out that ignacio was dead .
did juan tell you ?
no .
i found out myself .
will you just tell me how it happened ?
i arranged to meet juan at the museum of giant figures .
he had it all planned out .
much more than it seemed at first .
i' il buy the junk and you give it to him .
why me ?
fuck , he' s my brother !
i' m not a monster .
do you think this doesn' t hurt me ?
but he' s ruining all our lives .
what will we do afterwards ?
we won' t meet for a while .
why ?
you said there' d be no investigation .
just in case .
it' s best not to arouse suspicion .
i' il go and look after my mother , she' il need it .
when things calm down , i' il call you and we' il go away .
have you got the money ?
yes .
no .
what will i do while i' m waiting ?
work , earn money .
we' il need it .
the situation at home is unbearable .
apologize to your wife and enjoy your son .
tell her the truth .
what ?
say you' ve been with someone else , a woman .
give me your mother' s address .
it' s best if i don' t .
then you won' t be tempted to come see me .
what are they laughing at ?
they' re laughing at us .
at me , at least .
juan bought deadly pure heroin .
he gave it to me and i went to ignacio' s .
alone .
this is my last fix .
what do you mean ?
i' m quitting .
this time i really am .
before i get my face and all the rest done ,
i' m checking into a detox clinic .
i' ve already applied .
good .
you' il have the money tomorrow .
i hope so .
before noon , ok ?
just in case , i wrote two letters , one for the publisher and the other for your wife , telling all you' ve hidden from them in the past and present .
that' s unnecessary .
give them to me !
when i get the money .
before noon .
pretty , aren' t they ?
what ?
my tits .
yes , they' re wonderful .
thank you .
shall i help you ?
no , no .
go away .
i don' t like fixing in front of you .
it' s done .
pull in here .
we' il go to the cinema to kill time .
it' s as if all the films were talking about us .
now what ?
i' m going home .
you want me to go with you ?
no , you' d better not .
remember to get those two letters .
yes .
if you don' t we' il be in trouble .
i' il get everything don' t worry .
if we won' t be seeing each other for a while , give me some of the super 8s .
it would console me to see us screwing .
you' re nuts !
what if your wife saw them ?
we have to burn them .
i' il take care of that .
let' s go .
get in for a minute .
no , i' m going to take a taxi .
then ,
i won' t see you again ?
it' s just for a few days .
taxi .
call me as soon as you can .
yes .
ignacio ?
enrique .
what' s wrong ?
you !
at last !
i read in this film magazine that you were here .
what did you tell him ?
everything .
now you only have me , darling .
you' re crazy .
remember i' ve got my brother' s letters , accusing you of his death .
we both did it , my love .
the letters only mention you .
enrique , wait !
enrique .
are you all right ?
leave me alone !
if i ever see you again , i swear i' il kill you !
now that i' ve found you , i won' t let you go .
get used to the idea .
mnica .
can you give me a lift ?
sure .
yes ?
get in the front .
hello .
who was that ?
someone looking for enrique .
who is it ?
it' s me .
give me back the keys .
your things are in the hall .
take them away .
the taxi' s gone .
you' il have to lend me the car or drive me back to madrid .
i want to order a taxi .
11 , avenida del aqua .
enrique goded , yes .
thank you .
i was going to tell you after the shoot .
tell me what ?
that my name is juan .
that i' m ignacio' s brother and ignacio died four years ago .
i knew that already .
i know that you knew .
what do you mean ?
my mother rang to tell me you' d been to the house .
i guessed you' d learned everything .
when you asked for the audition , you knew that i knew ?
yes .
and you still kept pretending ?
what else could i do ?
i didn' t lie you knew everything .
no , i didn' t , far from it .
i knew you' d taken ignacio' s place and that he was dead , but i never imagined that you' d killed him !
that' s the taxi .
i didn' t kill him , berenguer did !
ignacio was blackmailing him .
and you were hustling him !
the taxi' s waiting .
you don' t know what it is like to have a brother like that and live in a small town .
juan , the taxi is waiting .
why did you choose me ?
you still don' t see me as zahara .
was it just to fuck me ?
it was curiosity .
i wanted to see how far you would go and how much i could take .
i would go a lot further .
i bet you would .
you needn' t explain any more .
it' s not mine .
it' s from ignacio .
i think i' ve succeeded ...
after the release of " the visit
