this is a victory for any celebrity who wants to make a quality action figure .
what' s the secret of your success ?
teamwork .
i do a tremendous amount of teamwork , and i always have a plan .
come on .
yeah , my plan .
i knew from the start there was no phantom .
the luna ghost is , in fact ...
old man smithers ?
the creepy janitor ?
he wanted revenge after you refused to go out with him .
how could you , pam ?
i' m a lover boy of george clooney an proportions .
fred , how was the ghost able to fly ?
i can answer that .
watch .
these balloons fill with a highly potent helium synthesis ... ... giving the luna ghost ... ... his weightless appearance .
i would have gotten away with it too , if it weren' t for you meddling kids ... ... and your dumb dog !
i' il get you for this !
scooby dooby doo !
fred , i can' t believe you took credit for my plan again .
some plan .
that ghost pawed me for an hour and a half .
it' s not our fault you always get kidnapped .
i don' t always get kidnapped .
can' t believe you' d say that .
oh , please .
you come with your own ransom note .
my glasses !
who' s helpless now ?
i' m going to kill you , daphne !
watch the ascot !
you guys , look , i know i' m just the dude that carries the bags ... ... but we all play an important part in this group .
i mean , we' re just like a big , delicious banana split .
fred , you' re the big banana .
daphne , you' re the pastrami and gum flavored ice cream .
and velma ... ... you' re the sweet and sour mustard sauce that goes on top .
that sounds pretty good , doesn' t it ?
you know what , shaggy ?
you' ve really put it in perspective for me .
thanks .
i quit .
no .
no way .
you can' t quit .
i was gonna quit in , like , two seconds .
now everyone will think i copied off the smart girl .
now , wait a minute .
maybe i quit .
i do .
yeah , i quit .
i' m out of here .
good riddance .
don' t ...
no .
don' t go .
come on , you guys , don' t do this .
please don' t go .
do i quit ?
no , scoob ... ... friends don' t quit .
it looks like it' s just you and me for a while .
what now , shaggy ?
i guess we' il all just do what we do best , scoob .
this is primo .
man , talk about toasted .
man , the only thing i like better than an eggplant burger ... ... is a chocolate covered eggplant burger .
with hot sauce .
yeah , just another beautiful day in paradise .
i' m looking for a " mr. rogers " and a " mr. doo . " the detectives ?
it' s probably somebody looking for us to solve some scary mystery .
nobody home !
quick , scoob o , grab the food o , let' s scram o .
i' m looking for a " mr. rogers " and a " mr. doo .
let' s go !
i' m sorry , dude .
i' d love to help you out .
you look like a really nice guy .
we' re not detectives anymore .
i' ve been sent by mr. emile mondevarious to invite you ... ... to his amusement park , spooky island .
we don' t go near places with " spooky , " " haunted , " or " creepy " in the name .
or hydrocolonic .
right , but that' s for another reason .
but he' d like you to solve a mystery .
he' il pay you a fee of $10, 000 .
it' s just , materialism is not really our bag , man .
free airfare .
no , thanks .
room and board .
no , thanks .
and all you can eat .
all you can eat ?
fred ?
velma ?
are you going this way ?
how have you ... ?
been ?
yes .
great .
the many faces of me .
jinkies , that' s impressive .
and yourself ?
i' ve been working at nasa , developing hydropowered missile defense systems .
but , more importantly ... ... i' m on a journey of self discovery .
nasa ?
charter service to spooky island will begin boarding momentarily .
what do you mean i can' t have seven carry on bags ?
that' s so economy .
crap .
oh , no .
i' m not talking to you guys .
what are you doing here ?
isn' t it obvious ?
we all received the same letter from one emile mondevarious ... ... the reclusive owner of spooky island .
it' s not fair .
i was gonna solve the mystery all by myself .
and when you get caught ?
i' m a black belt now .
i' ve transformed my body into a dangerous weapon .
it' s true .
far out .
i guess we' re , like , all going to spooky island , man .
where' s scooby ?
hello .
sorry .
they don' t allow big dogs on the plane .
you' ve got to be kidding .
no one is stupid enough to believe that .
who' s the ugly old broad ?
say hello to grandma .
aloha .
flight 3774 to spooky island , now boarding .
i wouldn' t have agreed to come if i knew .
wait , just think about it for one minute .
mystery inc .
reunites .
we' il be a team again , just like the old days .
only if fred and velma do it .
people are watching , shag .
yeah , scoob , " roo hoo .
come on , buddy .
now that is a beautiful work of art .
would you mind me taking a seat there next to ... ?
to my grandma .
that' s my grandma .
hi , grandma .
like , no .
thanks .
you' re welcome .
bless you .
i' m sorry .
my allergies .
it' s usually only dogs that do it .
maybe i' d better move .
no , wait .
it' s probably just my grandma' s perfume .
yeah , even i sometimes get a little allergic , you know .
oh , jeez .
i' m pretty sure grandma wants to go back and visit with her pal velma .
right , grandma ?
okay .
boy , oh , boy , those sure do look like scooby snacks .
i know they' re for dogs ... ... but they' re 100 %% vegetarian , and i love them .
like , me too .
far out .
i' ve never met another person who loves scooby snacks .
me neither .
i' m mary jane .
like , that' s my favorite name .
really ?
no way .
hello .
grandma ?
velma , it' s simple behavior modification .
to cause a dog to discontinue any action , flick it on the nose .
observe .
scoob ?
see ?
sit , grandma !
bad , grandma !
don' t eat the kitty !
welcome to spooky island ... ... the frightfully popular spring break spot for college students .
catch our electrical torture parade .
it' s a dead world after all .
and the world famous splatterhorn .
scooby doo !
and the rest of mystery inc .
it' s marvelous to see you !
how fanta ...
i' m sorry .
that' s the second time this week .
thank goodness .
it' s a new toy .
i' m just getting up to speed with it .
welcome .
thank goodness .
i was afraid i' d have to lug those to the hotel .
that' s what spooky island' s about , realizing your worst fears .
i' m emile mondevarious , the owner of this amusement park .
you seem less ...
spooky . ... than we' d have guessed .
i can be pretty spooky when called upon .
claws and everything .
you wouldn' t want to run into me in a dark alley .
so you' re the one who brought us here ?
no .
what brought you here was your insatiable appetite ... ... for a juicy mystery .
the truth is , mystery inc .
is broken up .
that' s the beauty of something broken .
it can be fixed .
therein lies its potential .
and i need you to fix spooky island .
what' s the problem ?
i believe somebody' s casting a spell on the students .
now listen and look around .
notice any difference between those arriving and those departing ?
they look like sober , well behaved college kids .
precisely .
they didn' t before they came .
they' ve changed .
in other words , a magic spell .
carol !
carol , how was the island ?
are you tricking on me ?
it' s me , brad .
we' ve known each other since we were 3 .
back off my grill , son !
carol , what are you doing ?
i' m terrified .
the young people that come off that barge ... ... the people i love the most , they' re in danger .
i' m going to solve this one first .
not before i solve it first .
you' il look like total idiots when you' re captured and i save you .
thank you .
marvelous .
maybe we can celebrate later by having a little spookapalooza .
spookapalooza ?
you haven' t noticed anything unusual since you started working here ?
any weirdoes running around ?
no .
welcome , dear victims .
my name is n ' goo tuana .
this is my evil best pal , zarkos .
you may recognize him from telemundo as the famous masked wrestler ... ... zarkos .
this enchanted island ... ... is a thoroughfare to the supernatural realm .
for centuries , it was home to creatures who lived on the island undisturbed .
but then ... ... ten years ago ... ... emile mondevarious ... ... antagonized these ancient beings by building a theme park here .
the creatures are furious , my friends .
and i assure you ... ... while you party ... ... they plot ... ... their revenge !
do my friends frighten you ?
they would , if it weren' t for the holographic projectors ... ... there , and there and there .
what a smart little one .
hello , dead mike' s .
we got a " mr. doo " here ?
i got a call for a " mr. doo .
melvin doo ?
no , scooby .
hello ?
got a bag ... ... of hamburgers here for you .
just walk into the dark , shadowy part of the forest ... ... where no one can see you .
okay .
want a stuffed thingy ?
nobody can win those .
fred says it' s a worthless talent , that i should' ve learned french instead .
i say you don' t need to know what " voulez vous coucher avec moi " means ... ... to love that song .
i think being good at crane machine is way cooler than french .
voil .
nobody' s ever given me a stuffed dismembered head before .
excuse me .
now i have to start my voodoo ritual all over again !
voodoo ritual ?
i was about to sacrifice this chicken .
that chicken' s not alive .
i know .
what , did you figure that out when you saw it didn' t have a head ?
what do you want ?
why you in the voodoo ritual space ?
i' m looking for clues as to who' s behind the students ' strange behavior .
purple is a fall color .
it' s the middle of may !
pardon ?
do yourself a favor and get off this island .
go home .
go home before evil befalls your skinny , aerobicized booty .
and whatever you do ... ... do not , i repeat ... ... do not go into that spooky island castle .
you want me to go to that castle .
didn' t you hear what i said ?
you knew i' d do the opposite of what you said .
you told me not to go to the castle so i would go ... ... where you set a trap to capture me .
unless ... ... you knew i' d figure it out , so you told me not to go ... ... so i' d think you wanted me to go , so i wouldn' t go .
i' il find out what you' re hiding in that castle .
you watch .
what in the world ?
hamburgers , where are you ?
hamburgers .
thank you .
shaggy !
it' s been really nice .
shaggy !
monster !
monster !
a monster ?
scooby doo , quit goofing around , man .
i guess i should go .
bye , scooby .
bless you .
shaggy .
scooby .
no way .
scoob and me don' t do castles .
why not ?
they have paintings that watch you , suits of armor you think is a statue ... ... but there' s a guy inside who follows you every time you turn around .
how many times did that happen ?
twelve .
we' re not gonna do it .
that' s right .
scooby ?
did you hurt your paw ?
would you do it for a scooby snack ?
oh , boy !
and you' il be fearless ?
fearless ?
hong kong phooey , watch the fists of fury .
here you go .
thank you .
there' s plenty more where that came from .
let' s go before someone sees .
you' re not gonna stay out here alone , are you ?
no , thank you .
oh , boy .
this place is , like , uber creepy .
yeah , uber creepy .
the only thing missing is a mindless zombie .
fred , get back .
i found this place .
i call dibs on its clues .
i' ve already found some clues .
what ?
i followed some weird footprints here .
it might be dangerous for you .
if anyone messes with me , i' il open a can of chinese whoop ass on them .
what are you doing here ?
this ride was closed for construction .
it' s the most likely place to hatch a plan .
and i wanted to scare daphne .
since we' re all together , let' s split up and look for more clues .
daphne , you and i ...
typical .
what ?
nothing .
i was always picked last for the teams .
okay .
daphne , exit through the entrance .
velma and i will enter through the exit .
and shaggy and scooby ... ... do whatever you guys do .
look at this , huh , scoob ?
it' s like a medieval sizzler .
pinch me , i' m in heaven ...
it' s an expression , scoob .
sorry .
velma , i never meant to ...
well , you know ... ... pick you last .
don' t worry about it .
i know you .
all you care about are swimsuit models .
look , i' m a man of substance .
dorky chicks like you turn me on too .
that' s a compliment .
yes !
yes !
oh , yeah .
oh , yeah .
oh , yeah .
oh , yeah .
oh , no !
and now for our dinner show .
what ?
watch out !
i got a bad feeling about this .
me too .
you !
feast on this .
jinkies .
they' re moving toward us .
run !
we' re trapped .
quick , try the bookcase .
one of these has to open a passageway .
velma , this is a ride .
you got a better plan ?
what do we do ?
eat .
it' s plastic .
so what ?
you drink out of a toilet .
so do you .
i' m not helpless .
i am helpless .
i' m gonna die !
we made it , scoob .
we' re alive !
that was weird .
fred ?
are you all right ?
the last book .
i don' t feel so good .
reminds me of the time we tried to eat that guy in the hot dog costume .
looks like some kind of school .
in a spooky castle ride ?
fishy .
welcome to america .
i am using the language english .
shaggy , look .
let' s check it out .
oh , boy .
lights , camera , action , huh , scoob ?
now that you' re a young adult ... ... you' il need to learn societal dos ... ... and don' ts .
interaction between young people is polite and casual .
hey , sorry , bro .
i will crush your bones into dust .
let' s see how the situation should be handled .
remember , today' s young people have a language all their own .
sorry , bro .
no big whoop , dog .
catch that new vid on the box ?
true dat .
i' m up to sniznuff on all popular trends .
word .
it seems to be a brainwashing facility of some type .
wherever there' s a brainwashing cult , there' s always a power hungry leader .
the papa smurf figure .
mondevarious .
then why would he have invited us here ?
jellybeans .
i' il have whatever he' s having .
are you challenging me ?
maybe .
pull my finger .
too late .
you' re in trouble .
oh , boy .
i' m not stopping till your fur is singed off .
we' re here to solve a mystery .
yeah , scoob .
let' s get out of here .
zoinks !
skedaddle !
i found a neat and scary clue .
us too .
this is a brainwashing facility for an evil cult .
maybe this is the secret relic thingy they worship .
we' il all be relics if we don' t get out of here .
i got a plan .
what' s that smell ?
sir , they found the daemon ritus .
for your sake , they better not have gone far .
it is time to summon the big muchachos .
like , oh , no !
mystery inc .
you all seem rather cheery .
good news , i hope ?
mr. mononucleosis ...
yes ?
we have hit a clue smorgasbord .
we have three suspects as to who' s behind this evil hooty .
n ' goo tuana .
he believes your park' s on enchanted ground .
the voodoo man , who tricked me into going to the castle .
and you .
me ?
let' s split up .
we' il meet in a half hour .
i' il interview employees to see if they' ve noticed anything odd .
i' il translate these inscriptions daphne found .
i' il go research cults on the net .
i' m a suspect ?
don' t take it personally .
it' s because you creep me out .
i see .
fine .
jinkies .
hey .
your friends ditch you ?
no , i always did the brainwork .
what' s this ?
i believe it' s called the daemon ritus .
daemon ritus ?
what' s it for ?
this describes an old race of creatures .
it' s reminiscent of pandaemonous texts , so i can make some of it out .
it looks like instructions to some sort of secret ritual .
it is fascinating .
on the house .
nice sweater .
you really dig doing this , huh ?
like , clues and stuff .
certainly .
really focusing on a mystery reminds me of the old days .
we were quite a crew back then .
that was the best time of my life .
shaggy and scooby ...
what goofballs !
kind of like they are today .
and daphne ...
so beautiful .
she was the coolest girl at coolsville high .
fred .
he was so handsome .
and he really knew how to accessorize .
sounds perfect .
yeah , but every family has one nut .
scrappy dappy doo !
ghosts don' t stand a chance with me .
let me at ' em .
i' il rack ' em .
i' il sock ' em .
for the thousandth time , there' s no such thing as ghosts .
sure there are .
when i find them , i' il give them a dose of puppy power !
oh , god .
he' s peeing on me .
that little egomaniac had flipped his lid .
scrappy , i told you , no urinating on daphne .
it was an accident .
you were marking your territory .
you don' t have the scrote for this job .
listen up , losers .
the time has come to appoint me your unquestioned leader .
either that , or i' m out of here .
what' s the idea ?
you can' t do this to me .
people adore me .
i' m as cute as a powerpuff girl .
i' il get my own show .
puppy power , huh ?
and he wasn' t even a puppy .
he had a gland disorder .
help me !
help me !
monsters !
monsters !
this is the most embarrassing thing you' ve done ... ... since you cleaned your beans at don knotts ' christmas party .
how many times do i have to tell you ?
there are no such things as ghouls , ghosts , goblins or monsters .
now listen up .
there is absolutely ... ... absolutely no such thing as ...
monster !
fred !
scooby ...
save daphne .
my glasses .
i can' t find my glasses .
help me find my glasses .
here they are .
thank you .
nice mask .
bad breath .
here .
jinkies .
velma !
come on !
velma !
this is , like , the opposite of what i wanted to do today .
leave it !
stand back , sir .
i' il protect you .
mr. mondevarious !
daphne , go !
scooby doo , where are you ?
running suitcase .
run suitcase .
run ...
thank you .
where' s scooby ?
i hope he' s okay .
right here .
scooby dooby doo !
hey , scoob .
i have a sinking feeling these dudes aren' t brainwashed cult members .
what do they want with the students ?
we need to follow them .
say what ?
defeat them and save fred and velma .
get out of here , let the creatures eat fred and velma .
no way .
fred and velma always figured out everything .
now it' s our turn .
for the first time , they' re the damsels in distress , not me .
help ?
timber .
okay , i' m calling for help .
no .
i got this .
i got this .
i don' t got this .
coast guard , fitzgibbon .
hello , sir .
we' re on spooky island .
our friends were ... ... kidnapped .
we need someone here right away .
we do have a unit in the vicinity .
can you meet them at the pier ?
all right , they' il be right there .
our friends have been kidnapped .
something messed up is happening .
is the coast guard here ?
what happened to the shattered windows and busted walls ?
yo , red .
the ball .
let' s go .
anyone else think this is strange ?
okay , we need to split up .
why ?
we need to find fred and velma .
i' il go this way .
and we' il go with you .
come on , scoob .
fred ?
yo , the bitch was like , " what ?
and i was like , " later on !
what up , dog ?
and ... ... dog .
keeping it real .
what happened last night ?
we got beats like it was the lizz nizz .
you know what i' m saying , g ?
no .
you hear that ?
get the dog .
damsel in distress .
let go of me .
help !
hurry , get the door !
why is fred in a bad mood ?
he' s not in a bad mood , scoob ... ... he' s a monster .
shaggy , bikes !
i know , " yikes !
no , bikes !
scoob !
shaggy , look out !
i just saw my friend beth ann .
something' s wrong with her eyes .
like , hop on !
like , what a drag !
like , duck !
yes !
that was great !
are you all right ?
you were great .
you too .
scooby , what are you doing , man ?
mary jane is a man in a mask .
mary jane is a man in a mask ?
scooby .
what are you doing , man ?
step off , scoob .
shaggy , you' re whipped .
i' m whipped ?
yeah ?
why don' t you say that to my face ?
okay , i will .
your mommy eats cat poop !
no , scooby doo , your mom eats cat poop !
bring it .
you want a piece of the shagster ?
feel the pain , scoob .
okay .
come on !
two shots !
two shots !
me and you , me and you again .
i' il give you some right now , buddy .
scoob !
i gotta save him .
you stay here , i' il be right back .
no , shaggy .
i mean , it' s too dangerous .
i' ve got to .
he' s , like , my best pal .
friends don' t quit .
scoob ?
scooby doo ... ... where are you ?
scoob ?
shaggy .
shaggy .
shaggy !
velma .
i' il save you .
thanks , shaggy .
boy , am i glad to see you .
let me go so i can return to my body .
get out of here ... ... before they steal your protoplasm too .
i always knew you were a hero , shaggy .
jinkies !
hey , buddy .
shaggy !
someone must have spiked my root beer last night .
talk me down , man .
fred , you' re a frigging protoplasmic head .
i know .
but i' m still the best looking protoplasmic head here .
how do you drive this ?
the darkopalypse' s upon us .
get what you need for the ceremony .
on your right .
your left .
i' m coming , good looking !
thank you , you' ve saved me .
sorry , i' m looking for my friends .
but ...
put me back , shaggy .
i' il figure a way out myself .
like , how ?
i don' t know .
i' il use my tongue as an oar and swim to the edge .
sorry .
yo , yo , you , yo .
what the ... ?
you could use a little sunlight .
that' s one part of the mystery solved .
the creatures need our bodies to survive in sunlight .
like a human suit .
spf 1, 000, 000 .
but what are they doing here in the first place ?
daphne , you okay ?
yeah .
but i' m not daphne !
fred ?
i couldn' t get to my body .
i didn' t know where else to go .
it' s not easy to steer when you' re pure spirit .
i can look at myself naked .
oh , brother .
get your hands off me .
daphne ?
he planned this somehow , didn' t he ?
hey , good looking .
fred , you egocentric ...
please tell me you guys are you .
fred keeps touching me .
makes you nostalgic for the homicidal creatures .
i stole this .
i hope it helps .
the daemon ritus .
i' m me again .
yippee for you .
man , like , why am i wearing a dress ?
everyone remain calm .
velma , what the heck' s going on ?
if i am correct ... ... due to the instability of protoplasm in the proximity of the daemon ritus ... ... we' re going to continue randomly changing bodies until ...
jinkies !
... until the protoplasm realigns with the correct bodies .
i' m fred again !
daph , what' s wrong with you ?
don' t you ever eat ?
i' m me .
i' m back .
like , me too .
told you so .
oh , no .
let' s go .
i guess that was the wrong ingredient .
wait .
i know how to handle this guy .
hey , you !
what' re you doing ?
yes .
that is masterful .
i' m doing a voodoo ritual .
i need to get the right ingredients .
the only way to protect myself is by blessing this dead arnouki beast .
they' re about to perform their evil darkopalypse ritual .
darkopalypse ritual ?
right .
that' s what the ancient text describes .
don' t open that !
they use the protoplasm in the vat as an energy source .
and the leader needs to absorb a purely good soul to complete the ritual .
legend has it , once the ritual is performed ... ... the creatures will rule on earth for 10, 000 years .
that' s why i have this in my house .
to protect myself .
you have another one of those ?
those creatures are taking over the world ?
that is so mean .
they can' t do the ritual without a pure human soul .
where will they get one ?
i didn' t say human .
oh , boy .
hello , puppy .
if the person behind all this needs scooby doo ...
then that person is the one who brought scooby here .
scoobert .
how are you , my friend ?
sit down , please .
okay .
scooby snack ?
maybe one .
we' il need some more of those .
that' s me !
it certainly is .
and that' s because ... why ?
we love you , scooby doo .
unlike that alleged friend of yours , shaggy .
he wouldn' t believe you about that nasty girl mary jane , would he ?
no .
but i believe you , my friend .
and that' s why i' ve got a very important job for you .
what' s that ?
that' s a cat with a bobbing head .
please don' t touch it .
i would like you ... ... to be a sacrifice .
a sacrifice ?
if mondorajagaga wanted scooby , why' d he invite the rest of us ?
it doesn' t matter .
