children , look at this map , the black mark of which , must be erased .
you hide it with your little fingers and you mark it with red .
then , whatever it may happen , promise to go and find ... ... the children of alsace who are spreading their hands to us .
let the green branch of hope to blosom in our beloved france .
blossom from you , dear child .
grow up !
france is waiting for you !
to rip the map of every trace of germany and of the hun ... ... we must exterminate that race , we must not leave a single one ...
heed not , their children' s cries they slay all now , the woman too ...
or else some day they will rise which if they' re dead , they cannot do .
we have one and only enemy , who is digging the germany' s grave .
with a heart full of hate , gall and envy ...
we have one and only enemy , who raises his murderous hand .
you know the enemy' s name .
it' s england .
this is it !
war has been declared !
well little brother , are you gonna spend repainting statues ?
i put you down to that list too !
in two days , we' re all leaving for basic training in glascow .
at last something' s happening in our lives .
well ?
are you coming ?
two minutes yet mr .
sprink .
i have been ordered ... ... to read this message from our beloved kaiser .
this is a dark hour for germany .
our land is besieged .
and we must brandish the sword .
i hope ... ... that god will give us strength to use it well ... ... so we can resheathe it with dignity .
two minutes yet , lieutenant !
we' re going out .
the german trenches are 100 meters away .
we' re bombing their machine guns for more than an hour .
that' s good for us .
we pass their first line and then the farm which is behind .
the 134th will replace us tonight .
so we can get some rest .
the scots will cover us from the left .
you' il recognize them from their black caps .
don' t worry about them , you' il only pay attention to what i say !
i' m like you !
i want to go back to my home as well !
so let' s do what we have to do , and in one week we' il be back home for christmas .
let' s do what has to be done !
prepare your bayonets !
load your rifles !
let' s go !
don' t stay here .
someone of us survives .
don' t stay here .
no william ...
no william !
come on !
come on william !
i abandoned him ...
like a coward ...
i abandoned him ...
i let him die ... all alone ...
you had no other choice .
and now we must pray for him and for all the other casualties .
the reinforcements arrived ...
we' re leaving dale ...
you stay here with the rest of the wounded ...
i' il see you back in base ...
i know you' re in the trenches father ...
it' s andrew duncan ...
i' m not far .
father , i' m eight feet away .
the others ... the others are too far away but me ...
father , you' ve got to come over to help ...
that' s it .
just walk , straight ahead and you' il get on top of me ...
i knew ...
i knew i could count on you father .
what the hell are you doing ?
this is a suicide !
don' t run !
don' t run off like that , darn you !
come back ...
come back here !
cease fire !
he was the stretcher bearer !
what ?
you shot the stretcher bearer !
how do you know that ?
why did you shoot first ?
it was a scotts marauder , sir .
i think i got him !
good .
stay put .
with the slightest move , sound the alert !
yes sir
sprink ...
come with me .
yes , lieutenant !
attention every one .
leave the enemies weapons in the main trench !
go help them .
allright .
we have to rebuild it .
don' t worry .
none saw me .
did you get hurt ?
what happened ?
you were for barely 15 minutes in the trench .
reinforcements didn' t ...
their machine guns annihilated us .
i lost a third of my men in 5 minutes .
you saw the scots retreat on your left and you left the farm .
did you learn anything new ?
i tried the red cross but nothing ...
impossible to get news from the enemy zone .
information say , the germans are treating the civilians good .
your wife must be at her parents ... with the baby ...
during the bombing , one of our cannons exploded .
5 of our men and an officer died instantly .
i asked for you to replace him in that unit .
artillery is good .
you' il move up fast .
no .
i don' t want the artillery .
i' il stay here with my men .
find another lieutenant .
there are many .
i am the major general here and i rule according to what i feel right .
you' il do what i tell you to .
you' il make christmas in your unit .
then you' il go to poitiers for training .
that' s an order .
if you want your visit to remain secret , you better leave .
my orderly is coming soon .
you' il stay here for 3 days .
then you' il move in first line to the delsaux farm .
that sector should be quiet for christmas .
get some rest .
i' il see you before you leave for poitiers .
goodnight .
goodnight , general .
lieutenant , i found you some blankets for tonight .
what' s wrong lieutenant ?
my wallet ...
i lost my wallet ...
the wallet with the photo you showed me the other day ?
yes .
what a shame ...
but you don' t need photos to remember your wife .
i had a mishap as well .
take a look , lieutenant ... 2 centimeters higher , and i' d be dead !
it' s still ringing !
unstoppable , like me !
right lieutenant ?
in the briefing it says we put one every 5 meters .
every five meters ?
so , how many ?
about 100 . 000 .
or 20 trips with train for lille via brussels .
incredible !
christmas trees !
it will take longer to send these trees in front ... ... than it would take to send our cannons .
let miss sorensen in .
how is he ?
he' s fine .
his regiment got attacked four days ago ... ... but they pushed back the enemy .
now , about your proposal ...
i' m afraid ...
i can' t accept it .
i feel that , as a dane , you can' t understand how serious the situation is .
for 5 months now , 2 million of our men are fighting without pause .
we have neither the time nor the urge to organise a recital .
it took me a while to understand ... ... that i approached the wrong person .
the heir , who saw me , was delighted with the idea to have ... a recital at his headquarters on christmas eve .
i was told , you are responsible for the cannons and the convoys ... ... and also the soldiers .
so if you would kindly sign here , next to the heir ... ... before you inform your men .
you' il only see him for a night .
what' s the point of that ?
it will be much more than one night .
our minutes are longer than yours .
mother , william and i got your package and your letter ...
thanks for the mittens and the mufflers .
it' s so cold here , they' re most welcome .
the thought of you at home nice and warm , keeps us good .
thanks for the cake too .
i hope we' il have some left for christmas eve ...
your two sons ... who love you .
good morning father .
three cases of whiskey .
that' s a lot of ammunition .
i presume i' m invited ?
my men are completely exhausted .
we' re all tired gordon ...
every single one of us .
i can bring you no relief before three days .
and if the germans do attack tonight or tommorow as its suggested they would .
we' iljust have have to deal with them .
yes sir !
our valiant stretcher bearer !
you' re the one who nearly got one of his own men killed in no man' s land .
the stretcher bearer is supposed to save lives .
not endanger ' em .
i gave orders .
very clear orders ... ... that it' s forbidden to leave these trenches in case of a german counter attack !
yes sir , but the situation ... but , you don' t give a damn !
now i suggest you drop the st. bernard act in future ... ... and never forget , something called military discipline !
is that understood ?
do you understand ?
perhars you wanna tell me what you' re doing here in the front line in the absence of any combat .
i was visiting a friend ...
what ?
a friend ?
where do you think you are ?
your local parish ?
now you' il return with me immediately to the back line .
come on man !
make yourself usefull for once .
sir .
this way' s shorter .
we move up here , we take a right through the clergy area ...
this way ?
get me out of here , will you ?
i' m sorry we have to go through the clergy sir ...
christ !
what a bloody fucking mess .
just get me out of here will ya ?
yes sir .
absolutely sir !
shut up , will you ?
as a priest im used to the silence .
that' s enough .
what' s going on ?
nothing .
just a rifle shot .
it' s dead calm .
good .
be carefull , they won' t stop even on christmas eve .
follow me .
do you know who' s brilliant idea that was ?
no .
that' s for you lieutenant .
sprink ...
you' il be leaving us ... for a night .
to go where ?
home , in a way , where you' il be better .
why do you dislike me lieutenant ?
after your regiment was disbanded , i had to take you .
but i prefer masons , bakers , farmers .
artists like you arejust a waste , nothing but a millstone .
now go .
the officer will take you .
come on , get moving !
10 o ' clock and nothing is done yet .
take it easy there .
isn' t that too short ?
i told you lieutenant , i' m the best barber in lens .
even the may or was coming to my store .
and henri hennebicque ?
was he your customer too ?
hennebicque ?
doesn' t sound familiar ...
he was my father in law .
deputy may or .
lives at 21 cypress street .
you never told me sir .
i know cypress alley well .
i went there several times to get my bike fixed .
at narcisse denoyelle , number 43 .
i can see it right now , a little blue gate .
i think i can tell you now ...
sometimes , at nights , i' m heading to the road towards the farm .
slowly , so i won' t get killed ... and i sit there ... and i look ...
i know the delsaux farm pretty well .
i was going there with my bike to get eggs and milk .
just bey ond the farm is the road to lens .
straight to lens .
on foot , i' d be back home in less than an hour .
with no rush ... one hour ...
my mother would wait for me at the door ... with a cup filled with hot coffee , just like before ...
i' m done lieutenant .
i think i' m done .
well ?
there' s no mirror in front ?
christ how stupid am i ?
but i got you a great haircut sir , you' re ready for the party tonight .
if you say so ...
welcome miss .
my pleasure .
miss sorensen , its a pleasure .
i will not tolerate mistakes !
clean it up right now !
where is nikolaus sprink ?
i think he arrived an hour ago .
sprink ?
the tenor ?
miss , we owned this house for 300 years now ... ... but its no longer our home since september 23rd .
ask somewhere else , if you can .
if they have any taste , they will put him in my room ... ... on the top floor .
you poor thing ...
good taste ...
prussians ?
you shouldn' t even talk to these people !
no ...
i have lice ...
we' il sing together again , just like before .
i' m not like before , anna .
sing for me .
sing for us .
your highness .
i' m glad to see the war didn' t affect you .
your volunteer as a private ... ... impressed me .
i am not a volunteer your highness .
i was called like every one else .
i congratulate you for your initiative , miss .
you reminded us , that despite the war , it' s christmas .
thanks to you and your voices ... ... tonight i' il feel like i am in berlin . ... where i hope to return as soon as possible .
perhars next spring ... if everything goes according to plan .
next spring !
do you smoke ?
every one smokes in the trenches .
you have to kill your time in any way possible .
it' s five years today , since the day we met ...
in oslo ... ... five years passed already ?
you have to flirt with death to realize how time flies away .
that' s a terrible thing .
all these fat and sated men , parading and drinking champange .
i have to return to the front ... to sing for my comrades , tonight , more than any other time .
for months i was trying to make this true , and you want to go ?
i don' t want to leave you ... but i must go and sing for them .
i' il return after that .
i' il come with you .
no way !
it' s too dangerous .
you can' t imagine how much .
since the time you left , not even a single second passed ... ... without me wondering if you' re still alive .
you are alive .
and i am with you .
nothing else matters .
i was waiting this night for very long .
i don' t want to lose a single moment .
and without my pass from the kaiser you' il not go that far ...
you got a pass from kaiser ?
the major general places his trust on you .
couldn' t they leave us quiet on christmas eve ?
we always have to do the dirty work .
i volunteer to go .
i don' t want trouble , gueusselin .
go there , approach their lines , locate theur machineguns and return .
understood ?
and if they see me with this moonlight , can i return fire ?
go , be discreet and come back fast if you want a hot meal .
hey lads .
where did you get the pipes ?
from the guys of the 92nd , they learnt we' re doing christmas here .
any spare seat there ?
froggy land .
come on father , give us a song .
play " i dream of my home " .
rosbif land .
looks like they' re having fun there .
would you like us to have fun as well ?
this is anna sorensen .
good evening .
are you crazy , and you brought a lady here ?
lieutenant , i convinced the heir ... ... that a little music wouldn' t do any harm .
good .
you can start .
lieutenant !
come and see .
something weird is happening .
i don' t like this lieutenant .
could be a diversion for some dirty trick .
get down every one !
good evening , englishmen !
good evening germans ... ... but we' re not english , we' re scottish .
it was very nice , but that' s enough .
this is not berlin opera .
you' re right .
it' s even better than berlin .
look at that .
a meeting and we' re not invited !
shut up ponchel .
what the hell is going on here ?
good evening .
do you speak english ?
yes ...
a little .
wonderfull !
we were talkin about a ... a cease fire ... ... for christmas eve .
what do you think ?
the outcome of this war won' t be decided tonight .
i don' t think any one will criticise us for leaving down our riffles on christmas eve .
don' t worry .
it' s just for tonight .
what the hell are they doing ?
maybe the germans are fed up and want to surrender .
i would be surprised ...
ponchel , give me a bottle of champagne and my beaker .
merry christmas .
who' s the idiot who did that ?
merry christmas .
good evening .
i' m anna .
you first .
felix .
where have you been ?
his name is not felix .
it' s nestor .
he' s nestor , the cat from the delsaux farm .
i know him better than you .
nestor' s is going to the french side .
my wife .
she' s a pretty girl .
very .
this is my wife .
montparnasse .
it' s my wife' s favourite part in paris .
the luxemburg gardens .
by the way , you didn' t show us a picture of your wife .
uhm , like you i had a photo of her but ...
i lost it .
i' ve draw her face but ... that' s not really the same .
do you live ... on rue vavin ?
yes ... ?
i think i ...
i found your wallet in the trench .
i kept it because of the address .
a little hotel on rue vavin .
i spent a week there with my wife , two years ago .
it was our honeymoon .
thank you very much .
you' re welcome .
hold on , thats gueusselin' s bottle .
who cares .
he went to sleep .
i would be surprised if he did .
thank you ... very much ... sirs ...
it' s good !
how many month' s pregnant was she on that photo ?
five months .
she was in lens , at her parents , last july .
she had complications and had to stay in bed ...
i asked to stay with her , but i couldn' t .
i was called to go to war , and had to leave her there .
but ... don' t you write each other ?
how is she ?
i had no letter from her since september .
they never make it here .
i don' t even know if it' s a boy or a girl .
hey scottsman .
you know what i got here ?
the french gave me some champagne .
do you want to drink ?
sing for us .
sing for them .
