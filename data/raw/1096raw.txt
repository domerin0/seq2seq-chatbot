jesus .
hey , where' s the fire ?
amos ain' t home till midnight .
freddie ?
fred ?
hey , you know ,
i don' t want you to feel like i m nagging at you or anything , but don' t you think it' s about time that i met your friend down at the onyx ?
i mean , it' s been a month since you told him about me .
i know .
' cause that was the night velma kelly , plugged her husband and her sister .
you know , they say that she found them in the kip together .
gosh , if i ever found
amos soapin ' it to somebody else ...
boy , i' d throw him a party .
a big , big going away party .
it s getting late .
i have been thinking a lot about my act , though .
whenever i get a good idea , i write it down in my diary before it goes out of my head .
and you know what occurred to me ?
the other day ... that ... all the really really knock out acts have something a little different going on , you know ?
like , a signature band .
and i thought my thing could be .. " aloof " ... you know ?
give them just enough to get them good and hungry but always leave them wanting more .
once i get a name for myself , maybe maybe we can open up a club of our own , you know ?
you could run it , and i could be the headliner .
oh , get off .
what' s the idea ?
wake up , kiddo , you ain' t never gonna have an act .
says who ?
face it , roxie .
you' re a two bit talent with skinny legs .
and i' m just a furniture salesman .
yeah , but you got connections , you know .
that guy down at the club ...
there' s no guy .
yeah , that night ...
it was the first time i set foot in that joint .
i was collecting on a bet from the trombone player .
so you never told anyone about me ?
sugar , you are hot stuff .
i would have said anything to get a piece of that .
so now what ? ...
now ?
we had some laughs .
let' s just leave it at that .
fred ...
you can' t do this to me .
you get off !
you touch me again , i il put your lights out .
wait ...
your husband will be home soon , why don' t you wash yourself before you go hitting those sheets again .
you' re a liar , fred .
oh , yeah , so what ?
you lied to me ...
that' s life , sweetheart .
that' s life .
you son of a bitch ...
you son of a bitch !
you son of a bitch !
why are you bothering , sal ?
this one' s all wrapped up .
i hear it' s a new city record .
from killing to confession in an hour flat .
why did you get the murder weapon ?
i keep a gun in the underwear drawer .
just in case of trouble , you know .
that' s just fine .
sign right there , mr. hart .
freely and gladly .
freely and gladly .
and mind you don' t say we beat it out of you when you get up on the witness stand .
no , i give myself up .
surrendered of my own free will .
isn' t he the cheerful murderer !
shooting a burglar ain' t murder .
just last week a jury thanked a man .
i m always grateful for citizens who know the law .
get in there .
you too .
sit down .
okay , from the top .
a man has got a right to protect his home and his loved ones , right ?
of course he has .
i come home from the garage , and i see him climbing through the window .
with my wife roxie laying there , sleeping like an angel .
is that true , mrs. hart ?
i m telling you , it' s the god' s honest truth .
my wife has nothing to do with it .
she won' t hurt a worm .
not even a worm .
it wasn' t until i fired the first shot , then she even opened her eyes .
boy she' s some heavy sleeper , i always said she could sleep through the st. patty' s day parade .
when i think of what would have happened if i went out for a beer with the guys instead of coming straight home ...
it makes me sick even to think about it ...
for her first number , miss roxie hart would like to sing a song of love and devotion .
dedicated to her dear husband , amos .
* sometimes i' m right *
* sometimes i' m wrong *
* but he doesn' t care *
* he' il string along *
* he loves me so *
* that funny honey of mine *
* sometimes i' m down *
* sometimes i' m up *
* but he follows ' round *
* like some droopy eyed pup *
* he love me so *
* that funny honey of mine *
like i said , even after i shot him , he kept coming at me .
so i had to pull the trigger again .
* he ain' t no sheik *
* that' s no great physique *
* and lord knows * * he ain' t got the smarts *
* but look at that soul *
* i tell you that whole *
* is a whole lot greater *
* than the sum of his parts *
* and if you knew him like me *
* i know you' d agree *
* what if the world *
* slandered my name ? *
* why he' d be right there *
* taking the blame *
* he loves me so *
* and it all suits me fine *
* that funny sunny honey *
* hubby of mine *
i mean suppose if ... just suppose that he had violated her or something .
you know what i mean , violated ?
i know what you mean .
or something .
think how terrible that would have been .
it s good thing i got home from work on time .
* he loves me so * i' m telling you that .
* that funny honey of mine * i say i m telling you that .
fred casely .
fred casely ?
how could he be a burglar ?
my wife knows him .
he sold us our furniture .
he gave us 10 % off .
* lord knows he ain' t got the smarts *
she told me he was the burglar !
you mean he was dead when you got home ?
i m covering the sheet and she' s telling me some cock' n' bull story about this burglar .
and how i ought to say i did it ' cause i was sure to get off .
help me , amos . " she says , " it s my goddamn hour of need .
* now he shot off his trap *
* i can' t stand that sap *
* look at him go ! * and i believed her ,
* ranting on me ! * that cheap little tramp .
* with just one more brain * so she was two timing me , huh ?
* what a half wit he' d be ! * well i m through protecting her now ...
* if they string me up * i m on the garage with my butt 14 hours a day .
* well i' il know who ... * and she' s up there munching on bonbons ,
and tramping around like some goddamn floozy !
thought she could pull the wool over my eyes , eh ?
* that scummy ... * i wasn' t born yesterday . * crummy ... dummy ... * i tell you that some things a man just can' t take .
* hubby of mine . * and this time she pushed me too far .
i didn' t shoot him .
boy what a sap i was !
you double crosser !
you big blabber mouth !
you promised you' d stick ...
what' re you talking about ?
you' ve been sticking me , roxanne !
stop it !
you told me it' s a burglar !
the whole time you' ve been jazzing him .
goddamn it !
you are a disloyal husband !
look , it' s true .
i shot him .
but it was self defense .
he was trying to burgle me .
from what i hear , he' s been burglin ' you three times a week for the last month .
so what do you say , missus ?
that' s him , all right .
thank you .
your story doesn' t wash , mrs. hart .
so try this on for size .
fred casely was a good time on the side , with goofy here as a meal ticket .
meal ticket ?
he couldn' t buy my liquor .
and fred casely could ?
with a wife and five little caselys ?
or did he forget to mention them .
what ?
all his .

that bastard !
yeah , i killed him .
and i would kill him again !
once was enough , deary .
take her downtown .
come on .
here they come !
this way , honey .
oh , come on .
it s a shame to hide such a beautiful face .
why' d you shoot him ?
why don' t you give us a profile , with a little smile like the girl from the toothpaste ad ?
enjoy it while you can .
take this down .
assistant district attorney harrison says this is a hanging case .
hanging ?
i m ready to go to the jury tomorrow .
what do you mean hanging ?
not so confident anymore , are you ?
take her down to the cook county jail .
come on , sweetie .
headline .
what did you shoot him ?
was he cruel to you ?
did he beat you ?
was he foolin ' around ?

* and that' s the way i live *

i never heard of a man getting killed , when he didn' t get just what was coming to him .
hey , mama .

velma kelly ?
you' re the velma kelly ?
you know i was there that night ?
i was there the night that you got arrested .
yeah , you and half of chicago .

an editorial denouncing me in redbook magazine .
not in memory do we recall so fiendish and horrible a double homicide .
baby you couldn' t buy that kind of publicity .
couldn' t buy it ?
i guess i can keep this then .
nice try .
* if you want my gravy *

you know how people have these little habits that get you down ?
like , bernie .
bernie liked to chew gum .
no , not chew .
pop .
so i came home this one day , and i m really irritated .
and i m looking for a little bit of sympathy .
and there' s bernie , lying on the couch , drinking a beer and chewing .
no , not chewing .
popping !
so i said to him ,
you pop that gum one more time ...
and he did .
so i took the shotgun off the wall and
i fired two warning shots ... into his head .
* he had it coming *
* he only had himself to blame *
* if you' d have been there *
* if you' d have heard it *
* i betcha you would * * have done the same ! *
i met ezekiel young from salt lake city about two years ago .
and he told me he was single .
and we hit it off right away .
so we started living together .
he' d go to work .
he' d come home .
i d fixed him a drink .
we did dinner .
and then i found out .
single , he told me .
single my ass !
not only he was married , oh no .
he has 6 wives .
one of those mormons , you know .
so that night when he came home from work ,
i fixed him his drink , as usual .
you know some guys just can' t hold their arsenic .
* he had it coming *
* he took a flower * * in its prime *
* and then he used it *
* and he abused it *
* it was a murder *
* but not a crime ! *
now i m standing in the kitchen .
carving up a chicken for dinner minding my own business .
in storms my husband wilbur in a jealous rage .
you' ve been screwing the milkman ? " he says .
he was crazy .
and he kept on screaming , " you' ve been screwing the milkman !
and then he ran into my knife .
he ran into my knife 10 times .
* if you' d have been there *
* if you' d have seen it *
* i betcha you would * * have done the same ! *
what am i doing here ?
they say , the famous hungarian police , that i killed my husband .
but i didn' t do it .
i' m not guilty .
i can' t believe that uncle sam says i' m guilty .
they say i did it , but really i ...
yeah , but did she do it ?
uh uh !
not guilty !
my sister veronica and i had this double act .
and my husband charlie traveled around with us .
now for the last number in our act we did these 20 acrobatic tricks in a row .
1 2 3 4 5 split spread eagles
back flips flip flops ...
one right after the other .
so this one night before the show , we were down at the hotel cicero .
the three of us boozin ' , havin ' a few laughs .
and we ran out of ice .
so i go out to get some .
i come back .
open the door .
and there' s veronica and charlie , doing number 17 : the spread eagle !
well , i was in such a state of shock .
i completely blacked out .
i can' t remember a thing .
it wasn' t until later , when i was washing the blood off my hands , i even knew they were dead !
* they had it coming *
* they had it coming all along *
* i didn' t do it *
* but if i' d done it *
* how could you tell me * * that i was wrong ? *
* they had it coming *
* they had it coming all along *
* i didn' t do it *
* but if i' d done it *
* how could you tell me * * that i was wrong ? *
i loved al lipschitz more than i could possibly say .
he was a real artistic guy .
sensitive .
a painter .
but he was always trying to find himself .
he' d go out every night looking for himself and on the way ... he found ruth ,
gladys ,
rosemary , and irving .
i guess you could say we broke up because of artistic differences .
he saw himself as alive .
and i saw him dead .
* the dirty bum , bum , bum , bum , bum *
* they had it comin ' *
* they had it comin ' * * all along *
* ' cause if they used us *
* and they abused us *
* how could you tell us * * that we were wrong ? *
* he had it coming *
* he only had himself to blame . *
* if you' d have been there *
* if you' d have seen it *
* i betcha you would * * have done the same ! *
you pop that gum one more time ...
single my ass !
ten times
number 17 , the spread eagle artistic differences

now , billy flynn set your trial day for march 5th .
march 7th , you' il be acquitted .
on march 8th , you know what mama' s gonna do for you ?
mama' s gonna put you back on the vaudeville circle .
so now you' re an agent too ?
well deary , until ma bell installs a private line in your cell all your calls are gonna go through me .
what kind of dough are we talking about ?
you know , it' s a crazy world .
i mean , babe ruth is wearing rouge and playing a palace for $5, 000 a week .
yeah .
and what about someone with real talent ?
well , i can talk to the boys over at william morris .
and due to your recent sensational activities , they seem to think they can get you $2, 500 . $2, 500 ?
geez , the most me and veronica made was $350 .
yeah , well , that' s what happens when you have the right presentation .
you know what , mama ?
i always wanted to play big jim colosimo' s .
do you think you can get me that ?
big jim' s ?
yeah .
geez , i don' t know .
it' s gonna take another phone call .
and how much is that gonna cost ?
oh , come on , vel .
you know how i feel about you .
you' re like family to me .
you' re like one of my own .
i il do it for 50 bucks .
50 bucks for a phone call ?
you must get a lot of wrong numbers , mama .
oh , miss kelly .
that' s your personals .
freshly pressed by yours truly .
no , no .
it s my pleasure .
hey , listen .
can i ask you something ?
you know that harrison guy ?
he said that what i done is a hanging case and that he' s prepared to ask for the maximum penalty .
yeah ?
so ?
so , i m scared .
i sure would appreciate some advice .
especially from someone i admire as much as you .
you see , since i can remember , i have wanted to be on the stage .
really ?
what' s your talent ?
washing and drying ?
no .
i dance in the chorus .

i figure i d tell them the truth .
the truth ?
yeah .
that' s a one way ticket to the death house .
holy mother of god .
relax .
i mean , in this town , murder is a form of entertainment .
besides , in 47 years cook county ain' t never hung a woman yet .
so the odds are 47 to 1 ...
that they won' t hang you .
jesus , mary and joseph .
you' re talking to the wrong people .
what you need , is billy flynn .
who ?
billy flynn .
he' s only the best criminal lawyer in all of illinois .

well , not by prayin ' , dearie .
first , you give me a hundred dollars .
then i il make a phone call .
a hundred dollars ?
well you just ...
i mean , it seems pretty steep for a phone call .
oh , but he' s worth every cent .
he' s never lost a case for a female client yet .
and with a sweet little puss like yours , well ...
let' s just say justice ain' t so blind in chicago .
he' s never lost a case ?

miss kelly , do you remember anything at all about that night ?
i passed out completely , miss sunshine .
i can' t remember a thing .

i don' t know .
how much ?
we' il work it out after the trial .
now , if there are no more questions , miss kelly and i have a lot of work to do .

mama didn' t say anything about $5, 000 .
lookit , mr. flynn .
i m not very good at this sort of thing , but ...
maybe we could ... make some sort of arrangement between us .
and i can be an awfully good sport .
good , you got that out of your system .
now listen , you mean just one thing to me .

i will .
this is only a thousand .
plus this $300 i borrowed from the guys down at the garage , and there' s 7 ... $700 from the building and loan fund . $2, 000
and that' s all i got so far .
but i il give you $20 off my salary every week .
i il give you notes with interest .
double , triple , until every cent is paid , i promise .
when you came to me yesterday , i didn' t ask if she was guilty .
i didn' t ask if she was innocent .
i didn' t ask if she was a drunk , or a dope fiend .
no .
all i said was , do you have $5, 000 ?
you said yes !
but you don' t have $5, 000 !
so i figure you' re a dirty liar and i don' t waste my time with dirty liars .
look ...
i m real sorry , mr. flynn .
on the other hand , your devotion to your wife is really very touching .
i il take your wife' s case .
and i il keep it .
because i play square .
now look , hart .
i don' t like to blow my own horn .
but believe me .
if jesus christ had lived in chicago today and if he had $5, 000 and he' d come to me , things would have turned out differently .
all right , this is what we' re gonna do .
by the end of the week , i m gonna have roxie' s name on the front page of every newspapers in town .
sweetest little jazz killer ever to hit chicago .
that' s the angle i m after .
you make an announcement , we' re gonna have an auction .
tell them we gotta raise some money for the defense .
they' il buy everything she' s ever touched .
everything .
your shoes , your dresses , your perfume , your underwear .
and the victrola records .
like the one i was playing when i shot the bastard .
i didn' t hear that !
not that i didn' t have " grounds " , mind you .
hey , what are they ?
that' s when we go to trial .
look , nobody' s gonna care a lick what your defense is unless they care about you .
so first thing we gotta do is work up some sympathy from the press .
and they' re not all pushovers like mary sunshine , but
there is one thing that they can never resist .
and that is a reformed sinner .
so tell me ,
what was your favorite subject in school ?
oh , i was a real dummy .
there must be something that you were really good at .
i got high marks in courtesy and hygiene .
perfect , you wanted to be a nun .
a nun ?
where were you born ?
on a chicken farm outside of lubbock .
beautiful southern home , filled with every luxury and refinement .
where are your parents now ?
probably on the front porch in their rocking chairs .
parents dead .
family fortune swept away .
you were educated at the sacred heart .
then you fell into a runaway marriage .
left you miserable , alone , unhappy .
and of course you got all swept up in the mad whirl of this city .
jazz , cabarets , liquor .
you were drawn like a moth to the flame .
a moth ?
and now the mad whirl has ceased , and you are a butterfly , crushed on the wheel !
so which is it ?
is it the moth or the butterfly ?
you have sinned and you' re sorry .
god , that' s beautiful .
cut out god .
stay where you' re better acquainted .
kid , when i m through with you , not only will you be acquitted , but every man on that jury will wanna take you home to meet his mother .
i was born on a beautiful southern convent .
what ?
oh , holy shit !
oh , i m never gonna get this straight !
pipe down the swearin ' .
look , from here on in , you say nothing rougher than " oh damn " .
now try it again .
i was born on ...
come on ...
you know what are some more things to do on the witness stand ?
i thought i d get all teary eyed and ask for your handkerchief .
then i thought i d take a peek at the jury like this .
flashin ' a bit of thigh , heh ?
what do you think ?
sounds great .
hey , don' t you want to hear the rest ?
tomorrow , kiddo .
you' re at the top of my list .
well , well , well .
sorry to be late , mr. flynn .
hope you aren' t too bored .
i like it .
hey , pollyanna .
i heard your press conference is tomorrow .
yeah , what' s it to you ?
well , you wanted my advice , right ?
well , here it is .
don' t forget billy flynn' s number one client is billy flynn .
meaning what ?
meaning , don' t let him hug the spotlight .
you' re the one they pay to see .
remember , we can only sell them one idea at a time .
i can still see him coming at me with that awful look in his eyes .
and ?
and we ... both reached for the gun .
that' s right , you both reached for the gun .
ready ?
yeah .
good day gentlemen , gentlemen , miss sunshine .
my client has just entered a plea of not guilty .
we look forward to a trial at the earliest possible date .
now are there any questions ?
miss sunshine .
as you know , my paper is dry .
do you have any advice for young girls , seeking to avoid a life of jazz and drink ?
absolutely yes .
mrs. hart feels that it was the tragic combination of liquor and jazz , which lead to her downfall .
next question , please .
ladies and gentlemen ,
i would just like to say how flattered i am that you all came to see me .
mrs. hart is very pleased ...
you see , i was a moth ... crushed on the wheel .
you know , a butterfly , drawn to the ...
i bet you want to know why i shot the bastard .
shut up , dummy .
mr. billy flynn in the press conference rag .
notice how his mouth never moves ... almost .
where' d you come from ?

move over al capone ,
the windy city has taken a new criminal to its height .
the name on everybody' s lips is , roxie hart .
the sweetest little lady ever accused of murder in chicago .
women want to look like her .
fellows want to go out with her .
some little girls even want to take her home .
don' t get any ideas , little lady .
on the other side of town , the assistant d. a. promises the gay little sharp shooter will swing before the year is up .
who knows ?
if he lives up to his word ,
assistant d. a. harrison might become governor harrison some day .
back at the scene of the crime , everybody wants a little piece of roxie hart .
this jar of cold cream set her husband back 20 dollars !
maybe this pretty little lady will get some of that famous roxie style .
it seems everybody these days is rooting for ...
roxie hart .
take those wilted flowers over to the orphanage and make sure they know who sent them .
so , kiddo ,
given it any thought of what you wanna do after billy gets you off ?
yeah , i think i d like to go on the stage .
yeah , i figured as much .
i already called the morris office .
really ?
how much is that gonna cost me ?
a fair deal .
10 % of all your takings .
yeah , well .
we' il see , mama .
besides , i don' t even have an act yet .
killing fred casely was your act .
that' s all those stiffs in the audience want .
to say they saw somebody famous .
it s a freak act .
and besides , i am better than that .
of course you are , cupcake .
i mean , you can be as big as sophie tucker .
you really think so ?
bigger than kanther and juleson combined .
you know , i ve always wanted to have my name in all the papers .
before i met amos , i used to date this well to do , ugly bootlegger .
he used to take me out and show me off .
ugly guys like to do that .
once it said in the paper ,
gangland' s al capelli seen at chez vito with cute blonde corinne .
that was me .
i clipped and i saved it .
you know all my life , i wanted to have my own act .
but , no ...
it' s always no , they always turn me down .
one big world full of no .
and then amos came along .
safe , sweet amos .
who never says no .
i ve never done this before .
but you know , it is such a special night and you are such a great audience !
and ...
i really feel like i can talk to you , you know ?
so forget what you' ve read in the papers .
and forget what you' ve heard on the radio .
because ... because i m gonna tell you the truth .
not that the truth really matters .
but i m gonna tell you anyway .
in the apartment , amos was ... zero .
i mean , when he made love to me , it goes like ...
it was like he was fixing a carburetor or something .
i love you , honey ...
anyway ,
i started foolin ' around .
then i started screwin ' around .
which is ... fooling around without dinner .
then i met fred casely .
who said that he could get me into vaudeville .
but that didn' t quite work out like i planned .
i guess it didn' t really work out too great for fred either .
so i gave up on the whole vaudeville idea .
' cause if you can' t figure after all these years , opportunities just pass you by .
* but it ain' t *
* oh no , no , no , no . * * but it ain' t *
and now , with this flynn guy , with all these publicity ,
i got me a world full of yes !
* the name on everybody' s lips *
* is gonna be *
* roxie *
* the lady rakin ' in the chips *
* is gonna be *
* roxie *
* i' m gonna be a celebrity *
* that means somebody * * everyone knows *
* they' re gonna recognize my eyes *
* my hair , my teeth , * * my boobs , my nose *
* from just some dumb * * mechanic' s wife *
* i' m gonna be *
* roxie *
* who says that * * murder' s not an art ? *
* and who , in case * * she doesn' t hang , *
* can say she started * * with a bang ? *
* roxie hart ! *
boys ?
* they' re gonna wait * * outside in line *
* to get to see *
* roxie *
* think of those autographs i' il sign *
* good luck to you , *
* roxie *
* and i' il appear in a lavaliere *
* that goes all the way * * down to my waist *
* here a ring , there a ring *
* everywhere a ring a ling *
* but always in the best of taste *
oooh ...
i' m a star .
and the audience loves me .
and i love them .
and they love me for loving them .
and i love them for loving me .
and we love each other .
and that' s ' cause none of us got enough love in our childhoods .
and that' s show biz .
kid .
* she' s giving up here humdrum life *
* i' m gonna be *
* roxie . *
* she made a scandal and a start . *
* and sophie tucker * * will shit , i know *
* to see her name * * get billed below *
* roxie hart ! *
* roxie *
i just can' t take it anymore .
i can' t go anywhere without hearing about that dumb tomato !
oh , mama , not you too .
i have some bad news , kid .
the tour has been cancelled .
what ?
your name has been out of the papers too long .
all you read about today , is that hart kid .
she' s hot .
and what am i supposed to do ?
suck up to her like everybody else ?
it couldn' t hurt .
over my dead body .
mind if i join you ?
lights out , 10 minutes .
smoke ?
look what some johnny sent me .
triple cream caramels , all the way from san francisco .
i m watching my figure .
you know , the trial .
hey , great mention of you in the trib ' today , huh ?
there have been so many , i just can' t keep track .
hey , did i ever tell you ?
you' re exactly same size as my sister .
i mean , you' d fit into her costumes perfectly .
really ?
yeah , and i was thinking , you know , with all the publicity that' s piled up between us , and when billy gets us off , we' d be a natural to do an act together .
you think so , huh ?
ladies and gentlemen ,
miss velma kelly in act ... of desperation .
* my sister and i had an act * * that couldn' t flop *
* my sister and i were headed * * straight for the top *
* my sister and i earned a * * thou ' a week at least *
* oh , yeah ! *
* but my sister is now , * * unfortunately , deceased *
* i know it' s sad , of course *
* but a fact *
* is still a fact *
* and now all that remains *
* is the remains *
* of a perfect *
* double *
* act ! *
watch this .
now you have to imagine it with 2 people .
it' s swell with 2 people .
* first i' d ... *
* then she' d ... *
* then we' d ... *
* but i can' t do it alone ! *
* then she' d ... *
* then i' d ... *
* then we' d ... *
* but i can' t do it alone ! *
* she' d say , * * " what' s your sister like ? " *
* i' d say , " men , " *
* she' d say , * * " you' re the cat' s meow " *
* then we' d wow the crowd again *
* when she' d go ... *
* i' d go ... *
* we' d go ... *
* then those ding dong daddies * * started to roar *
* whistled , stomped , * * stamped on the floor *
* yelling , screaming , * * begging for more . *
* and we' d say , " o. k. fellas , * * keep your socks up . *
* ' cause you ain' t seen * * nothin ' yet ! " *
* but i simply cannot do it *
* alone ! *
so what do you think , huh ?
come on , you can say .
i know you' re right .
the first part is shit .
but the second part ...
the second part is really nifty .
* she' d go ... *
* i' d go ... *
* we' d go ... *
* and then those two bit johnnies did it a brown *
* to cheer the best * * attraction in town *
* they nearly tore the balcony down *
* and we' d say .
okay , boys ... *
* we' re goin ' home , but before we go * * here' s a few more partin ' shots ! " *
* and this ... *
* this we did in perfect unison . *
* now , you' ve seen me goin ' through it *
* it may seem there' s nothin ' to it *
* but i simply cannot do it *
* alone ! *
so where' s the part where you blew her brains out ?
okay , roxie .
i il ...
i' il level with you ...
no , don' t bother .
you think you' re fooling me ?
you' re all washed up .
and it' s me they want now , and i m a big star .
single .
oh , i almost forgot .
you were in the paper today too .
in the back .
with the obituaries .
velma kelly' s trial has been postponed indefinitely .
seven words .
wow .
oh !
and here' s a little piece of advice .
direct from me to you .
lay off the caramels .
and now , for all you chicago' s stay up laters .
you night owls who only come alive after dark ,
chicago after midnight .
this all took place in lake shore drive ?
incredible .
all right .
thanks .
they just arrested this woman for triple homicide .

yeah , get this .
she' s an heiress .
and all her family is in the ... pineapples ... grapefruit , some kind of fruit , i don' t know .
anyhow , this dame , kitty what' s her name , something ...
she' s playing house .
on the north side in an apartment , with a guy named harry .
what harry does for living , no one' s quite sure .
but it doesn' t really matter because she' s footing all the bills .
anyhow ...
kitty comes home tonight .
harry' s already in bed ,
she goes to change .
when she returns , she notices something ... rather odd .
extremely odd .
kitty disappears for a second .
cool as a cucumber .
when she returns , she gently wakes up harry .
harry says , " what ?
i m alone !
she says , " alone ?
you have two other women in bed with you !
so , get this , harry ... he says , " come on , darling ,
you gonna believe what you see or what i tell you ?
good night , folks .

poor dear , to have your baby born in jail ...
my readers won' t stand for this .
i can assure you that won' t happen .
she' il come to trial at the earliest possible moment .

when is the baby due , roxie ?
hey , roxie ...
roxie !
i just heard the good news !
i m the father .

it' s daddy !
roxie , i came as soon as i could .
rox ?

says she hadn' t copulated with you for four months prior to the incident .
well , she would know .
yeah , i guess we hadn' t done no copulatin ' since ...
wait a minute .

knitting ?
oh , for christ' s sake .

that' s no way to win a jury' s sympathy .
oh , you don' t need advice anymore ?
lookit here , mr. mouthpiece .
it seems to me that i m the one who' s coming up with the good ideas .
i m sick of everybody telling me what to do .
and you treat me like dirt .
you treat me like i' m some dumb , common criminal .
but you are some dumb , common criminal .
well , it' s better than being a greasy , mick lawyer .

who' s out for all he can steal !
maybe you' d like to appeal in court without me .
maybe i could .
have you read the morning papers ?
they love me !
my zop !
they' d love you a lot more if you were hanged .
you know why ?
' cause they' d sell more papers .
you' re fired .

you' re flash in the pan and in a couple of weeks , no one' s gonna give a shit about you .
that' s chicago .

no !
not guilty !

katelin helinsky will become the first woman in the state of illinois to be executed .
and so ladies and gentlemen ...

and ...
and say nothing .
that' s right !
that was the deal , right ?

mr. flynn , his honor is here .
thank you .

i ve been around a long time .
believe me , you' ve got nothing to worry about .
it s all a circus .
a three ring circus .
these trials , the whole world ...
it' s all a show business .
but kid , ...
you' re working with a star .
* give ' em the old razzle dazzle *
* razzle dazzle ' em *

hello , amos .
amos ?
that' s right , mr. flynn .
amos .
amos , when did you file suit for divorce ?
a month ago .
was there any reason for filing at this particular time ?
well i il say ...
the newspapers said roxie was expecting a little stranger .
that' s hardly ground for divorce , is it ?
a little too much of a stranger .
by that you mean you doubted the paternity of the child .
well , sure .
tell me something , amos .
do you share a bed with your wife ?
yes , sir , every night .
you expect this jury to believe that you slept next to this woman every night without exercising your rights as a husband ?
i could have if i wanted to .
oh , but you didn' t .
no , i did .
did what ?
want to .
but you didn' t .
didn' t what ?
what you wanted .
wait a minute , i m getting confused here .
hey , tell me hart .
you tell me .
did you ever question roxie herself ?
did you even bother to ask her if you were the father of her child ?
no , sir .
no .
what ?
if you became convinced that you were wrong , you' d be man enough to admit it .
wouldn' t you ?
you' d even be willing to take her back if roxie swore that you are the father of her child ,
which she does .
she does ?
she does !
no more questions !
you can step down now .
well done , andy .
roxie , i m so sorry .
* give ' em the old *
* razzle dazzle *
* razzle dazzle them *
* show ' em the first rate * * sorcerer you are *
* long as ya keep ' em * * way off balance *
* how can they spot * * ya got no talents ? *
* razzle dazzle ' em *
this is the moment we' ve been waiting for .
roxie hart finally takes the stand in her own defense .
* and they' il make you a star ! *
order !
order !
proceed , mr. flynn .
roxie , i have here a statement in which you admit to having ... illicit relations with the deceased , fred casely .
is this statement true or false ?
i m afraid that' s true .
you' re an honest girl , roxie .
when did you first meet fred casely ?
when he sold amos and me our furniture .
and your personal relationship with him ?
can you tell the jury when that began ?
when i permitted him to escort me home one night ,
i don' t think i would' ve gone with him if mr. hart and me hadn' t quarreled that very morning .
quarreled ?
yes , sir .
well , i suppose it was his fault .
oh , no , sir .
it was my fault .
i suppose i just couldn' t stop pestering him .
pestering him ?
about what ?
i didn' t like him working those long hours at the garage .
i wanted him home with me ... to darn his socks and iron his shirts .
i wanted a real home , and a child .
so you drifted into this illicit relationship because you were unhappy at home .
yes , i was most unhappy .
roxie hart !
the state has accused you of the murder of fred casely .
are you guilty or not guilty ?
i m not guilty ...
i m not guilty !
i killed him ...
i did .
but i m not a criminal .
i m not a criminal ...
roxie ...
do you recall the night of january 14th ?
could you tell the jury , in your own words , the happenings of that night .
when fred came over , i told him the good news .
and what was that ?
that me and amos were gonna have a baby .
and that it was all over between us .
what happened then ?
then ...
did he threaten you , roxie ?
objection , your honor .
counsel is leading the witness .
sustained .
what does casely say when you told him the news ?
i il kill you before i see you have another man' s child !
could you tell the audience ... the jury , what happened next ?
in his passion , he ... tore off my robe and he threw me on the bed .
and mr. hart' s pistol was lying there between us .
and then !
and then we both reached for the gun but i got it first .
and then he came towards me with this funny look in his eyes .
he was angry and wild !
wild !
wild !
and did you think he meant to kill ya ?
oh , yes , sir !
yes sir !
so it was his life or yours !
not just mine .
i closed my eyes and i shot !
in defense of your life !
to save my husband' s innocent unborn child .
order !
what a bull' s eye , huh ?
order in this court !
roxie !
it' s pandemonium here in the courtroom ...
mrs. hart' s behavior throughout this ordeal has been truly extraordinary .
yeah , i bet it has ...
opening her eyes , she fans herself with her attorney' s handkerchief .
handkerchief ?
poor child has had no relief .
she looks around now , bewildered , seeming to want something .
oh , it' s a glass of water .
oh , mama , that was my bid !
i told billy ,
i was gonna do that on my trial !
but now her eyes flutter wildly and she ...
mrs. hart has fainted again .
she flumps over , her chiffon dress up around her knees , revealing a glimpse of a blue garter with rhinestone buckle .
oh , mama , she stole my garter .
she stole my garter !
don' t break my radio !
first the slob steals my publicity , then she steals my lawyer , my trial date ,
now she stole my goddamn garter .
what do you expect ?
i mean these days you get a little success and it' s good riddance to the people who put you here .
there ain' t no justice in the world .
and there ain' t nothing you can do about it .
you think i got you up here just so you can listen to my radio ?
people write some pretty interesting things when they think no one' s looking .
oh , mama .
state calls a rebuttal witness .
left hand on bible , raise your right hand .
you swear to tell the truth , the whole truth , and nothing by the truth , so help you god ?
and then some .
have a seat .
would you state your name for the record please .
velma kelly .
miss kelly , will you please tell the court if the object i m holding is the one you happened to came upon in the defendant' s jail cell ?
yes , it is .
i submit this as exhibit x.
roxie hart' s diary .
i object !
my client has never kept a diary .
and even if she did , this would be invasion of privacy and violation of fourth amendment and illegal search without a warrant .
yeah , and she broke the lock !
order !
well , that settles that .
i il allow it .
what' s the big deal ?
it' s just a bunch of doodlings .
if you would read for us , please , miss kelly .
i haven' t worked in a while .
what a laugh , pluggin ' fred casely .
what ?
the big baboon had it comin ' .
i m just sorry i only got to kill him once .
i never wrote that .
you ...
hey , she made that up .
she made that up .
order !
please , mr. flynn , get control of your client .
i m sorry , you honor .
it won' t happen again .
sit down and shut up .
you' re making it worse .
i have no more questions .
your witness , mr. flynn .
ladies and gentlemen , a tap dance .
tell me , miss kelly , did you make a deal with mr. harrison ?
maybe to drop all charges against you in exchange for testifying here today ?
oh , sure .
i m not a complete idiot .
good .
since you gave such an impressive performance for mr. harrison ,
maybe you' il do me the same honor ?
i d be delighted .
thank you .
here ?
fred casely assured me he' d get me an audition down at the onyx .
and then he reneged on his pledge and that was my motive for attackin ' him .
the bit fat liar who welshed on a deal , so i shot him .
amos accused me of having an affair .
so i told him that the charge was ...
... erroneous .
objection , your honor .
mr. flynn is twisting this evidence to draw conclusions that are specious and ...
erroneous ?
exactly .
order !
miss kelly , do you know the meaning of the word perjury ?
yes , i do .
you also know that it' s a crime ?
yes .
for example if it turns out that you knew that this diary was a fake ,
i d hate to think of you rotting away in prison for the next 10 years especially since you just won your freedom .
look , all i know is what i was told .
oh , so ...
so you didn' t find this diary in roxie' s cell ?
no .
mama ...
miss morton gave it to me .
she said someone had sent it to her .
someone ?
any idea who this mysterious benefactor might be ?
no .
she didn' t know .
all right , let' s see if we can work this out .
someone who writes about " reneging on pledges
and ... " erroneous charges " ...
call me crazy , doesn' t that sound like a lawyer to you ?
a lawyer !
a lawyer who honestly had a sample of my client' s handwriting .
mr. harrison , didn' t you ask roxie to write out a confession for you ?
yes , but you' re not suggesting that i tamper with evidence , are you ?
no , let' s not be ridiculous .
that' s thoroughly and utterly absurd .
but now that you mention it ...
your honor , this is outrageous .
it outrageous !
i know , outrageous .
even to suggest it .
the prosecutor would make a thief' s bargain with notorious velma kelly .
and then fabricate the very evidence that set her free !
just so you can win another case and move one step closer to the governor' s mansion
why it' d simply be an unimaginable ...
i' il hold you in contempt .
no , it' s not even conceivable .
but ... but if it were , wouldn' t it be time to say ,
come clean , mr. harrison , come clean ...
even in chicago , this kind of corruption cannot stand .
will not stand !
that' s enough , mr. flynn !
i agree , your honor .
this is enough !
the defense rests .
ladies and gentlemen , this is mary sunshine reporting live from the cook county courthouse .
the city of chicago has come to a complete standstill .
as the trial of the century finally draws to a close .
mrs. hart sits quietly at the defense table , hands folded , wondering what fate has in store for her ?
and now a hush falls over the courtroom as the 12 men of the jury file slowly back to their seats .
gentlemen of jury , have you reached a verdict ?
we have , your honor .
the jury has reached a verdict .
will the defendant please rise ?
what is your verdict ?
we , the jury , find the defendant ...
roxie hart is innocent !
she' s innocent !
get your paper !
roxie hart is free !
she' s free !
roxie ...
come on !
move it !
first she shoots the husband then she plugs the lawyer !
hey , don' t you wanna take my picture ?
hey , i m the famous roxie hart .
hey , what happened ?
what the hell happened ?
this is chicago , kid .
you can' t beat fresh blood on the walls .
but my publicity , billy ?
my name in the papers .
i was counting on that .
your gratitude is overwhelming , kid .
i just saved your life .
yeah , and you got $5, 000 .
and what do i get ?
i get nothing ?
five ?
actually it' s ten once i collect from velma .
i get nothing ?
don' t forget your blessed diary .
hope you don' t mind .
i added a few erroneous phrases in there .
sorry , i couldn' t tell you .
couldn' t take the chance .
never lost a case .
you' re a free woman , roxie hart .
and god save illinois .
roxie .
what do you want ?
i want you to come home .
you said you still wanted to ... and the baby ...
baby , what baby ?
oh , jesus .
what do you take me for ?
there ain' t no baby .
there ain' t no baby ?
they didn' t even want my picture .
i just can' t understand that .
what didn' t they even want my picture ?

just shut up and listen to me ?
you really are something .
coming in here like ... some goddamn queen bee ,
all full of advice for a poor slob like me .
let me tell you something , miss velma kelly .
i got a new life now .
and one of the best things about it , is it don' t include you .
fine .
i just thought we could help each other out .
wait , you thought wrong , didn' t you ?
look ...
listen to me .
i talked to this guy downtown .
he said one jazz girl is nothing these days , but two ...
we can make a couple o ' hundred a week .
think about it , roxie .
our faces back in the papers our names on the marquee .
velma kelly and roxie hart
shouldn' t it be alphabetical ?
that could work .
a couple o ' hundred ?
maybe we could ask for a thou ' .
we' re worth it .
forget it , it' il never work .
why not ?
' cause i hate you .
there' s only one business in the world where that' s no problem at all .
ladies and gentlemen , the chicago theatre is proud to announce a first .
the first time anywhere there' s been an act of this nature .
not only one little lady , but two .
you read about them in the papers , and now here they are .
chicago' s own killer dillers , those scintillating sinners ,
roxie hart and velma kelly !
* you can like * * the life you' re living *
