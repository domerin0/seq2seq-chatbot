/ subedit b . 3918 /
you were right , varinia .
vengeance alone is not enough .
to become like your enemy is to lose to him .
but what' s important isn' t our living or our dying ... but this new thing we' ve created , however briefly .
a world without slaves .
and if you die , who will tell that story ?
live , so that i will live .
so that we will live on .
so that it won' t be wasted or forgotten .
did you see the look he gave you , varinia ?
i didn' t .
and even if i had ...
i wouldn' t care .
what sort of look ?
what look , you ?
what look ?
you tell me !
i made a promise once to tell our story .
it began in a small village in gaul ... where i was born a free woman .
then the romans destroyed my world and made me a slave .
nothing and no one could stand against the romans .
but rome herself was torn by conflict .
bloody civil wars raged for years ... between plebeians and their rivals , the patricians ...
led by senator marcus crassus , the richest man in the world .
as a child , he had seen his father murdered in the forum .
crassus had risen from the ashes of his family' s defeat ... to unlimited wealth and ambition .
ambition kept in check only by his rivals like antonius agrippa .
the civil wars were over .
men smiled at one another in public .
but the fighting never stopped .
fishing for votes ?
no , just enjoying our democratic way of life .
a new wine .
from spain .
delicious .
but i like your cupbearer better .
any news from spain along with the wine ?
a great victory by pompey .
another ?
the man is positively boring in his triumphs .
i shall console myself with the way crassus must feel .
pompey' s no great warrior .
he got so fat on the riches of his triumphs he can' t ride his horse .
disparage pompey all you like but the man gets the job done .
victory over a handful of vermin ridden gaulish peasants ... is hardly the mark of military distinction .
they say he will be consul .
this grape ... is not to my satisfaction .
more wine .
i think i' m going to borrow your wife , cornelius .
the wealth of a man like crassus could be seen in gold or silver ... but it' s true measure was in flesh .
thousands of slaves .
they lived out their short lives in a world of suffering ... at the whim of their masters .
no roman citizen gave them a second thought .
greetings , citizens .
today we offer a group of barbarians from gaul ... courtesy of the great pompey .
ahoy , batiatus .
what brings you up from capua ?
the same thing as you , i would imagine .
my stock needs freshening .
although how a man from the country can bid against a senator ...
i might as well go home .
a modest man from the country ?
yours is widely known as the finest gladiatorial school in all italy .
you flatter me .
no , not in the least .
look at this beauty .
and a virgin .
a virgin .
given the appetite of our frontier troops , i doubt that .
being a virgin is overrated .
it' s just an excuse to inflate the price .
good teeth .
wide hips .
and an excellent breeder .
magnificent .
she' s easy on the eye , i' il grant you ... but these gauls have thin blood .
they rarely last the winter .
i' d be like throwing your money away .
why , batiatus , are you in love ?
don' t worry , my friend .
i won' t bid against you .
you' re too kind , senator .
but i may need a favor some day .
of course .
five hundred sesterces !
done !
how can the senate choose pompey over you as the next consul ?
it would be a close vote .
i bought you a gift .
it' s beautiful .
you are too generous .
am i ?
well , i suppose i might be .
in the arms of the richest man in rome ...
and her husband' s best friend ...
show me .
helena might be forgiven her ignorance of the bracelet' s origin .
it' s true cost .
what is hell ?
hell is that place where the simplest action becomes painful .
where it hurts to walk ... to breathe , even to think .
the gold mines of egypt were such a hell .
among the thracian slaves condemned to an early death ... one would shake the roman world .
spartacus .
pick it up !
pick it up !
no !
stop !
so he' s a thracian , yes ?
worse .
he' s an animal .
good .
that' s even better .
this is your lucky day , thracian .
what kind of a place is this ?
move !
fresh meat !
shut your hole !
get back to work .
you stink , animals .
clean yourselves .
this way .
i want these cut into thin slices .
i wouldn' t give this to a dog !
i could get used to this .
i am gannicus .
this is spartacus .
david the jew .
he never talks .
some say he can' t .
you' re thracians ?
the crowd likes thracians .
be quiet , nordo .
eat .
didn' t get your name , friend .
you' re not my friend .
i don' t wanna know your name , your story .
why not ?
i might meet you in the arena some day , and then i' il kill you .
why wait ?
you' il have plenty of chances to fight .
save it for when you have no choice .
eat .
you must be the new thracians .
i can almost tell thracians .
you stink like pigs .
you must be crixus .
you' ve heard of me .
who hasn' t ?
crixus the big nose .
not surprised you could smell us .
enough !
to your cells !
now !
well , move , slaves !
you , spartacus .
where did you learn to fight ?
when a roman asks you a question , you answer , slave .
fighting romans .
crassus .
what a pleasant surprise .
i had no idea you still partook of such common pleasures ... as our public baths .
i do not disdain the public .
you love mankind .
it' s only people you can' t stand .
now , why is it that those who are most in favor of mob rule ... stand most to benefit from the public' s greed and stupidity ?
why is it that the rich are always so keen on reform ... after they' ve made their fortune and not before ?
the republic was a fine form of government ... when rome was a backwater city state .
times have changed .
rome rules the world now .
and one man with a strong vision must rule rome .
so power should be wielded by whom ?
the educated ?
the wealthy ?
the aristocrat ?
by crassus ?
or by pompey ?
plato did say that leadership must be left to the educated .
that leaves pompey out .
julius caesar , you mean .
you' ve heard what they say about him .
every woman' s man and every man' s woman .
but you' re right , pompey overreaches .
if he' s not careful , his head will be found hanging in the forum ... just like that of your father and your brother .
was it something i said ?
this is the roman short sword ... the gladius .
from which you get your names .
twenty two inches long , three pounds in weight .
a stabbing weapon for close work .
you kill a man with this and you can smell his sweat ... taste his breath .
but you sons of whores ... aren' t worthy of fighting with the gladius yet .
so you will use ... these wooden swords while i teach you .
you , slave .
pick it up .
come at me .
again .
too slow , slave .
pick it up .
too slow .
cinna !
so what do you think of our new thracian slaves ?
good , huh ?
they have spirit , but no real talent .
i see .
so you think they' re just very lucky ?
and cinna ... this boy was very expensive .
don' t damage my property .
enough !
go !
bring her .
come .
come here .
very good .
better .
come .
let me smell your hair .
you know ...
i can be a very good master .
oh , yes .
now , now ...
now kiss me .
no !
no !
hold her !
hey , spartacus .
how' s your nose ?
you got lucky .
do i have to break it again ?
so where did you fight romans ?
thrace .
you ?
gaul , where i was caught .
and then later in sicily where slaves rebelled .
you rebelled ?
two times .
the romans were terrified of us .
they still are .
now they kill a man just for talking about it .
why did it fail ?
fighting romans is like fighting a grist mill .
the stone keeps on turning .
no matter how many times you attack it in the end ... it grinds you down to dust .
faster !
put your backs into it , you sons of whores !
why do africans use the spear and the net ?
i amuses the romans to turn us into fishermen .
i was a farmer .
i never saw a net until i came here .
nordo , this man is trouble .
leave him be .
in the ring , draba , they ever pit the knife against the spear ?
the spear always wins .
enough talking !
back to work .
well , move , you scum !
put your body behind the blow !
good , draba !
push him back .
faster !
harder !
are you men or are you women ?
tomorrow some of you have the honor ... of fighting in the arena in capua .
nothing matters but that you fight well and with courage .
do this and even the defeated may receive mercy .
however if that is not your fate ... then the crowd will expect you to meet your death honorably ... in the roman manner , like this .
spartacus , kneel .
a defeated gladiator may beg for mercy ... by raising his hand thus .
the death blow is delivered in a single thrust to the neck ... here .
that is how a gladiator from the house of batiatus dies .
what' s the matter , thracian ?
lost your appetite ?
eat .
drink .
tomorrow we die .
i' m not dying tomorrow .
the gods decide when we die .
i don' t believe in the gods .
you don' t believe in the gods ?
when i look at the heavens i see only stars .
blasphemer !
you could be struck down for that .
no bolt of lightning .
so what do you believe in ?
us .
our will .
we decide when we die and how .
well , eat anyway .
you' il need your strength for tonight .
what happens tonight ?
war , little thracian .
sweet war !
quiet !
sit down !
a little wisdom .
a man is no good in the arena if his parts shrivel up .
a gladiator is not a litter slave .
he is a man .
yeah !
and a man needs a woman .
quiet , quiet .
for those of you who fight tomorrow ...
i graciously lend you these lovelies .
use them well .
and in the morning ... show me what men you are .
cinna !
this is yours .
idiot !
david doesn' t fight tomorrow .
crixus .
you like to play rough , thracian .
here .
batiatus asks that she be made more pliant .
see to it .
i' m spartacus .
what are you called ?
you look cold .
here .
the stones are cold at night .
you sleep there .
i won' t bother you .
wake up , you sons of whores !
move already !
my name is varinia .
varinia .
come out , now .
today you are expected to bring honor ... to the house of batiatus .
fail to do so and you will curse the day you were born .
where are they going ?
capua .
they fight today .
the thracian , the one they call spartacus .
is he any good ?
couldn' t say .
he' s different , though .
how ?
all the gladiators here are strong men .
brave .
but they are still slaves .
they accept it .
not him .
he will not last long .
you were with him last night ?
yes and no .
you , girl !
come here .
you will attend me at the games .
but if you give me any trouble ...
i promise that our previous meeting will feel like a mother' s caress .
now , go and get yourself cleaned up .
line up !
i appreciate your contribution to my games , batiatus .
few people understand the financial burden i' m expected to shoulder ... while on duty in these dreary provinces .
thank you .
and i appreciate the loan of your troops .
security at an establishment like mine ... does not come cheaply either .
one hand washes the other .
of course .
more wine !
a perfectly ripened pear .
although somewhat bruised .
a problem with discipline .
but we' re working on it .
aren' t we ?
yes , my lord .
on the crosses .
who are they ?
arsonists .
they wear the tunica molesta , soaked in pitch .
change your mind about the gods ?
if there are gods in this world ... they' re not here .
burn !
burn !
crixus verses gaius .
gannicus verses antonius .
spartacus verses commodus .
this new gladiator , spartacus , is he really a thracian ... or are you still passing off greeks ?
he' s the real thing , through and through .
any good ?
cinna thinks the world of him .
don' t you , cinna ?
very well .
a thousand on spartacus .
kill !
kill !
kill !
kill !
are you hurt ?
i thought in the mines i' d seen man at his worst .
i was wrong .
a slave has no choice .
not me .
the ones who watched , took their pleasure in blood and death .
good move , thrace !
harder !
faster !
put your back to it !
can' t you lay with me , spartacus ?
is it because cinna ordered it ?
because cinna ordered it .
and thracian men and women are to remain chaste ... until they' re married .
slaves don' t marry .
i would marry you .
marriage requires a holy man .
i thought you didn' t believe in the gods .
i believe in what i can see , hear and touch .
my tribe believes that man was created by the gods .
that they live in us .
we' re flesh and blood , that' s all .
that is what an animal is .
the romans say that we' re animals .
that we are without souls .
but you are afraid to say that you agree with the romans .
i believe that i never met anyone like you , varinia of gaul ... and that i love you .
will you marry me ?
on what would you make a vow ?
on the blood that flows ... through my veins and the breath i take ...
i will be yours until the day i die ... and in my life there' il be no other but you , i swear .
on the blood that flows in my veins ... and the breath i take ...
i will be yours ...
until the day ...
until the day i die .
and in the life beyond .
can you tell there' s life after ?
i have faith .
there will be no other man but you .
i swear .
kill !
kill !
kill !
kill !
spartacus !
master , we have visitors , master , from rome .
cornelius lucius and his wife , helena .
and marcus crassus .
marcus crassus is here ... and you left him waiting outside ?
noble crassus .
you do me a great honor , sir .
i am lentulus batiatus .
please , sit .
i and my establishment are here to serve you .
some wine to wash away the dust ... and some honeyed ice , perhaps .
yes ?
how may i serve you ?
my friends and i' d appreciate ... a private showing of a pair of thracians .
excellent choice .
your honor is obviously a connoisseur .
to the death .
to the death ?
that' s an unusual request for a private showing .
i see that you' re joking .
that' s very good .
very amusing .
i am not laughing .
of course you' re not .
well , you' ve asked for thracians .
that means you must want good dagger work .
and i have the best in the world .
but if you want to the death , you won' t see nuance ... and you won' t see subtlety .
certainly won' t see quality .
madame .
i' m not a butcher , sir , i am an artist .
yes .
i want to give you good fighting .
good fighting .
and to the death .
i want to see courage .
i want to see passion .
and above all ...
i want to see finality .
but to the death will cost you ...
twenty five thousand denarii .
my god ... you could by an elephant for that .
done .
and i want no fakery .
no double cut for them to both suck the sand and pretend they' re dying .
if one of them is down , or if both of them are down ...
i want one of your trainers to cut their throats .
and they are to understand that .
now , i shall leave ten thousand on account ... and the rest when we have been satisfied .
note the africans .
theirs is the finest combat and the most skillful but it can be a bore .
it can go on and on .
to see fighting at its best you must see thracians .
don' t you agree , slave master ?
but each kind has its virtues .
change of plan .
match me a thracian against a black .
with all due respect , my lord , that is no match .
a thracian only has a dagger .
and when it' s in the net he' s finished .
yes , perhaps .
but ...
africans aren' t noted for their strategic thinking .
hannibal , of course , being the exception .
i want to see how long ... a mentally superior but lesser armed man can last .
my lord , that sort of experimentation ... makes for bad blood with the men .
well , for twenty five thousand denarii ...
i think you can afford to incur a little bad blood .
order !
what is it ?
what is it ?
a private fight .
who do you want ?
draba .
and david .
now , he' s a jew , yes ?
yes , i know you want a thracian ...
no , no .
this is interesting .
ever seen a jew fight ?
exceptional with the dagger and reputed to be very bright as well .
who else ?
spartacus and polymus .
spartacus ?
how do you like them ?
all .
except that one .
i don' t like him .
forgive me , lady , but that man ... has been in the ring twelve times .
he' s very good , strong and quick .
who will you match him with ?
with the african .
what are you doing ?
praying .
how do you pray ?
i can show you .
will you do something for me ?
something that we do in our tribe ?
put your mouth on mine and breath your soul into me ... and i' il breath mine into you .
and then for all time our souls will be one .
one soul in two bodies .
i will come back to you .
if you don' t , i will kill you myself .
you have to save your strength for tomorrow .
i am full of strength .
dagger against net and trident .
what kind of match is that ?
time .
time !
what are they thinking , i wonder ?
gladiators are animals , pure and simple .
if one thinks of them as people , one loses all perspective .
is it true what they say about the jews ?
how they mutilate their boys ?
would you like to see ?
bring me the jew before he fights .
bring the jew here .
the rest of you , to the house of expectation .
unclothe .
unclothe .
they do that to their children ?
how beastly .
perhaps that explains their much vaunted skill with the knife .
i want the jew to fight first .
of course , sir .
strike !
kill him !
kill him !
kill him !
kill him , jew !
why doesn' t he kill him ?
kill him !
why doesn' t he finish him ?
don' t expect mercy from me out there , thracian .
live , draba .
that' s what life is for .
if the gods love you ... you die in childhood .
that was extraordinary .
if the second pair is as good as the first , i shall be well pleased .
strike !
kill him !
kill him !
kill him !
kill him !
kill him !
kill him !
kill him !
stop him !
why didn' t he kill me ?
if he kills me , he lives .
if he turns on the romans , he dies .
he chooses to die .
who chooses to die ?
who chooses to die ?
maybe rather than live as a beast ...
draba chose to die as a man .
father !
it was just a dream .
no .
i slept until now .
now i wake .
move , you dogs !
move !
i said move !
move , you scum !
is it true that draba didn' t kill any of the romans ?
if a man throw his life away ...
he could die better than that .
will you die any better ?
he will die like a dog , and so will you .
so will we all .
are you my friend , crixus ?
was draba your friend ?
yes .
and my teacher .
did he teach you how to die ?
he taught me how to live .
i feed you the best food .
i give you women .
you live here like kings in idleness ... on the fat of the land .
and all i expect is your loyalty and obedience .
and what do i get in return ?
treachery .
cinna , fetch me a black man .
kill him .
now there will be no more trouble .
the dogs won' t even growl .
move it , move it !
you cows !
move , slaves !
are we dogs that you snap your whips at us ?
spartacus !
prepare to die !
cinna !
what the hell is going on out there ?
there' s too many !
you taught me well , cinna .
quiet !
quiet !
let him speak !
quiet !
listen to spartacus !
like you ...
i' ve been alone my whole life .
we could never look into each other' s eyes .
living like animals .
here is the lesson of draba .
i will be a man .
my life is my brother' s .
live to fight the romans !
smash the gates !
master !
the gladiators !
they have revolted !
well , don' t just stand there like a drooling idiot .
help me !
field formation !
go get my litter .
we have to get to capua .
to the garrison .
go !
hold your positions !
free men and women , listen to me !
we must get ready .
nordo , can you open the armory ?
lf i have to do it with my teeth .
spartacus , look .
david , go .
go .
talk to them .
what do you want me to say ?
invite our brothers to join us .
gifts !
i bring gifts !
freedom for you and your children !
come , join us !
freedom for you !
join us !
spartacus always said that you would speak some day .
david , varinia .
come .
you' il tell me later .
there' s one more thing i need to do .
maecenus !
maecenus !
thank you , thank you .
you' ve got to stop them .
where' s that slaves headed ?
in the hills to the south of here .
there' s a lot of valuable property .
you' ve got to save something .
too late for that .
double time !
march !
please .
please .
let' s go .
look .
they' re so arrogant ...
they' ve lost their formation .
so ?
so if attacked , they' d have to fight , man to man .
and who fights better man to man than gladiators ?
crixus , nordo .
we have guests .
should we not greet them ?
apparently there has been an uprising of gladiators in capua .
the entire garrison has been slain ... the slaves have taken to the hills ... where their revolt spreads .
this is what i' m talking about ... why we need strong leadership .
i propose that we send the city cohorts ... to crush this rebellion .
the entire garrison of rome ?
are you out of your mind ?
to fight slaves ?
how many of these creatures are there ?
who are they led by ?
it sounds like a job for an overseer and a pack of dogs .
they massacred the entire capua garrison .
the garrison at capua .
forgive my bluntness , but an effete band of pretend soldiers .
a slave rebellion is never a simple affair .
we all remember sicily .
twice the slaves ... attacked .
the second time they seized the entire island ... for over a year !
this particular revolt is taking place ... a mere one hundred miles from where we now sit and squabble .
so are you suggesting that we recall a legion from the frontier ?
pompey , perhaps ?
and wait weeks for him to arrive ?
will the slaves wait ?
i don' t think so .
we must deal with this matter promptly before it gets out of hand .
but the entire city cohorts ?
three .
three full cohorts .
under whose command ?
i realize that it is not customary for a man to put his own name .
then please do not break precedent .
i was about to suggest ... that the cohorts be sent under the able command ... of titus glabrus .
my lord , i hardly know what to say .
thank you for your confidence in me .
if it is the will of the senate and the people of rome , then i accept .
if it is indeed the will of the senate ... then titus glabrus go with our blessings .
fall upon this rabble with all the weight ... and majesty of roman law .
we will march across the world ... and turn it over , stone by stone !
look at them .
they think the war is all won .
it hasn' t even started .
how are we going to feed them or clothe them ... much less train them to fight the roman empire ?
by teaching them to share the burden .
like free men .
why did you propose glabrus ?
he' s as thick as he is vain .
but politically dependable .
why don' t put yourself forward ?
agrippa would have blocked me out of sheer spite .
besides there' s little honor in defeating slaves ... and terrible shame if one fails .
if glabrus succeeds ... a minor rebellion is put down and he owes me a favor .
and if he fails the whole city will be panicked .
and the senate will embrace the wisdom ... of a more permanent system of leadership .
fear isn' t a bad thing , caius .
it makes for a more malleable electorate .
crassus says he wants to be consul ... in order to restore the former glory of rome .
but he wants to transform the consul ... into a more permanent position .
emperor .
the day that crassus becomes consul ... is the day the roman republic dies .
the time has come to make some decisions .
we must leave ?
and to where ?
i want to go home .
everywhere is the same as here .
everywhere it is master and slave .
i go where i go .
no man tells crixus what to do anymore .
come down , crixus .
this is crixus the gaul .
maybe the strongest man among us .
but still , he' s only one man .
can you bend this ?
now all of these .
we are like the arrows .
separately we' re weak .
but together we' re invincible .
and that' s why the romans worked so hard to divide us ... tribe by tribe and country by country .
we' re one tribe then ?
yes !
is that your will ?
yes !
who will lead us ?
stand up if you want to lead .
spartacus .
spartacus !
spartacus !
spartacus !
spartacus !
if that is your wish .
and so one man doesn' t become a tyrant ... we need laws .
what are they ?
whatever we take ... we hold together .
no man should own anything but his own weapon .
we' il be rich with the gold taken .
we' il make the romans our slaves !
yeah !
i will not be a slave owner !
slavery is an evil .
an evil that turns all men slaves ... and slave masters into animals .
there will be equality and justice between both man and woman .
we' re one tribe then ?
yes .
one people ?
yes !
is that your will ?
it is my will .
it is my will .
it is my will .
it is my will .
then this is what we' il do .
we' il go from plantation to plantation ... from house to house ... free the slaves , and fight anyone who tries to stop us .
and we' il make an end to rome ... and build a new world where there' il be no slaves or masters !
what is going on up there ?
some plantation ... is burning the stubble of a field .
there' s too much smoke for that .
there' s a forest fire or something .
tell them to go faster .
helena !
faster !
why are you stopping ?
what is the meaning of this ?
whoever you are ... you are blocking the path of a citizen of rome .
move out of the way .
pick up your litters !
pick up your litters !
pick up your litters !
glabrus wishes us to know ... that while he hasn' t encountered the brigands ... evidence of their atrocities is everywhere .
a slave who doesn' t join their ranks is put to the sword ... and any roman unfortunate enough to encounter them ... meets a fate worse than death .
it' s with great regret that i report the murders ... of numerous nobles including cornelius lucius ... and his wife helena .
helena and cornelius lucius ?
are you sure ?
that is what it says .
the rebels ' leader is spartacus ... a gladiator from thrace .
he has led them to mt .
vesuvius .
it is there that i intend to trap and dispose of them .
rest assured i am mindful that i carry in my hands ... the glory and majesty that is rome .
titus glabrus .
so we' re to be equals , are we ?
does that trouble you ?
well , i' il do what i can to raise myself , but i make no promises .
you better .
a child needs a father it can look up to .
a child ?
we' re going to have a child ?
the slave army' s climbing the north wall of the mountain , my lord .
a little less liberal use of the term ' army ' , if you don' t mind .
sorry , my lord .
we' il camp here for tonight .
why don' t we push on , my lord ?
cut off the slaves before they reach the mountains .
it' s cold , i' m tired and i' m hungry .
we' il camp here .
i like it .
it' s light but it' s strong .
spartacus , we need to talk .
this is a war council .
what' s a woman doing here ?
she has every right to be here .
do women lead your armies ?
is that why jews ...
squirm under the roman thumb ?
what' s the excuse of the gauls ?
david has news for us .
three cohorts of roman soldiers have taken a position ... on the road below us .
we' re trapped .
they' re so confident they haven' t even built a stockade .
fifteen hundred men .
i knew this would happen , thracian , but you insisted .
the people are tired .
they need rest .
well , the dead rest forever .
you must' ve known they' d follow us here .
how do we get off this mountain ?
what' s your plan ?
i don' t have one .
you don' t have a plan ?
from the moment i stood up in the training yard ...
i' ve only thought as far ahead as the next move .
you must have an idea .
why must i ?
i' m no different from any of you .
isn' t that the point ?
that we' re all equal ?
yes , but ...
so one of you figure it out !
he' il be fine .
they chose you as their leader .
i didn' t ask for that honor .
no , but you didn' t decline it either .
and why should you ?
you' re the only possible choice .
but now the time to lead has come .
when i was alone ... all i had to lose was my own life .
now i have the lives of hundreds .
your life .
our child' s .
i have faith you' il find answers .
where ?
within the soul you say i have ?
yes .
you may not have chosen this moment , spartacus .
but it seems that this moment has chosen you .
my lord , is it true you' ve given the troops permission to camp ... without building the usual defensive fortifications ?
the men are tired and i am tired .
when a roman army bivouacs it is customary to build a fort .
it' s just a handful of slaves ... facing the same miserable conditions we are .
with women and children and one tenth of our equipment .
a little while ago some of you were asking me if i had a plan .
and the plan is this .
we will attack first .
david , hold your men outside the camp until you hear my cry ... and then charge in like the gods of hell .
if these don' t hold , i' il kill you myself .
if these don' t hold , you won' t have to kill me .
we' il all be dead .
you can tell us now .
you are safe here .
i was asleep .
i woke up to screaming .
the sound of screaming .
i was screaming .
their men were everywhere , like ravenous beasts .
and their women followed , feeding like harpies on the wounded .
the killing went on and on .
at the end our men threw down the weapons and plead for their lives ...
but there was no mercy .
how is it that you were spared ?
i don' t know why they chose me .
all i know is i was brought before their leader .
my name is spartacus .
i have a message for your senate .
tell them that we , the slaves ... say the roman way is corrupt and dead .
we want nothing from you .
leave us alone .
but if you come after us again ... we will destroy you all .
by all that rome holds sacred ...
i will see her honor restored .
i will not rest ... until this spartacus ... hangs , crucified ... at the gates of rome .
move and kill !
move and kill !
again .
move and kill !
move and kill !
faster !
they' re looking better .
against wooden posts .
we' il see what they' re like when the target fights back .
orsino is here .
the sicilian pirate ?
what do we have to talk to him about ?
a lot .
the key would help .
spartacus .
i could tell at once .
you have such an air of command .
you here to do business or flatter me ?
you' ve done well .
we like to think of it as back wages , long owed .
is it enough to buy us passage out of here ?
for yourself ?
for all of us .
if you take us beyond the borders of the empire they wouldn' t follow .
what you' re asking would require a great many ships ... and make me many enemies in rome .
so how many trunks of gold ?
at least five more like this .
when we are ready how do i signal you ?
get to the coast and fly this ... where it can be seen from the sea .
take it .
a gift for our new alliance .
i' il take it as a down payment .
i better get some help .
that was a fortune you just gave away .
we can' t eat gold , nor will it keep a sharp edge .
crixus , let' s keep this arrangement among ourselves for now .
we can' t trust that man .
orsino or crixus ?
either one .
over the walls !
as word spread of the revolt ... slaves from all over the country ran away from their bondage ... and flocked to join spartacus .
we all knew there was no turning back .
it was freedom or death .
and so we marched from city to city ... taking what we needed for the day we might finally be free .
but the fight for freedom was tainted by revenge .
no mercy was shown to those who fell into our hands .
is this wise ?
as long as they obey the laws it' s better to let them have their way .
they' re still a mob .
take everything !
making an army will take time .
intelligence reports the slaves are squatting ... on the coast at nola .
we must attack and annihilate all .
with what ?
thanks to your haste , we' il be 3 months rebuilding the garrison .
glabrus was obviously the wrong commander .
your choice as i recall , senator .
my choice by default .
there were and are better options .
pompey , for example .
recalling pompey now ... it' il jeopardize the spanish campaign .
well , i haven' t got your experience in the field , of course .
wait .
yes , that' s right .
you have none .
very well .
for now let us focus on rome' s defenses .
we cannot , under any circumstances ... allow the slaves to escape .
i say we march on rome !
there are sixteen cohorts in rome .
we' re outnumbered at vesuvius .
now ...
their bones rot in the fields .
but taking a city ... is different than ambushing a sleeping cohort ... that' s too lazy to build a proper camp .
for one thing , we have no siege equipment .
we can build it .
and while we do that , what would rome do ?
recall their legions .
the real soldiers .
not these city boys who play at soldier .
i say we march north ... towards transalpine gaul ...
and over the mountains to freedom .
rome is north .
and when we march past we' il thumb our noses at them .
there are many cities between here and the alps .
not just rome .
and many of them ...
i' m sure would be more than happy to pay us our back wages .
then we march !
yesterday , you had your fun with me in the senate .
today , let' s get down to business .
this spartacus is turning a rabble into a real army .
i don' t think we can count on him doing anything ... as ill conceived or impetuous as attacking rome .
still , it would probably be wise ... as someone has already suggested ... to strengthen the city walls .
those would be large contracts .
plenty enough to go around .
but if you really want to be confident about rome' s security ...
i cannot support your bid for consulship .
general of the next army ... sent against spartacus .
sixty forty on the contracts .
i make no promises .
i also think we should make an example .
there are one hundred thousand slaves in rome ... and they have all heard the story of spartacus .
what do you propose that we do ?
i say we make the price of rebellion ... painfully clear .
what is it ?
two hundred roman slaves ... picked at random ... and burned alive this morning .
hold , crixus .
we can' t sacrifice everyone to save a few .
we' re moving on .
the stench is appalling .
breathe deeply , flavius .
this is the smell of crassus ' new world order .
although it goes beyond anything i' d have thought him capable of .
i' m sorry .
the child is dead .
varinia ?
she must rest .
our son .
no .
you' re alive .
that' s what matters most .
i have failed you .
there will be others .
i promise .
our scouts indicate that the slave army ... is headed toward the alps .
but what message does that send ... to the hundreds of thousands of slaves in the republic ...
if we let them go ?
it pains me to say it ... but crassus is right .
we have to stop spartacus .
but no more city cohorts .
we must bring down ... the sixth and seventh legion from transalpine gaul .
frontier troops .
the slaves ... have never encountered experienced soldiers before .
agreed .
and we might even go one step further ... and say that such experienced troops ... require a commander of firm resolve ... and unshakable dedication ... which is why i nominate as general ...
publius maximus .
i never promised you leadership of the new army .
did it ever occur to you that i might be ... exactly what rome needs right now ?
if spartacus defeats this army and turns on rome ... where will your precious little democracy be then ?
it reminds me of the nestros valley where i grew up .
i thought you didn' t remember anything about thrace .
i remember a few things .
our farm .
sheep and goats .
you still have kin there ?
no .
i know your mom died in childbirth , but you never talk of your father .
my father' s dead too .
how ?
he was the village headsman .
the romans crucified him because our people were late with taxes .
we' ve never talked of where you and i will go once we leave here .
we haven' t left yet .
and at this rate ...
did you notice on the road how quiet it was ?
the slaves have stopped joining us .
they' re afraid .
rome has made its decision .
they won' t let us go without a fight .
we saw two full legions of the transalpine gaul force encamped ...
less than ten miles north of there .
can we get around them ?
they' ve picked their site well .
blocked all major passes .
and who' s their general ?
publius maximus .
what do we know about him ?
publius runs his army with a firm hand .
fierce but unimaginative .
two legions .
frontier soldiers .
we better start fighting early or we' il still be killing by night .
we won' t surprise this army at night like the last one .
this battle is on their terms .
how do we fight that ?
i remember a story about hannibal fighting a rock .
a foolish tale .
tell me .
in the alps , hannibal' s army came to a pass ... blocked by a huge rock .
no way around it .
for three days and nights he thought .
and then it came to him .
he ordered fires built against the rock .
all the precious wood that they had carried for themselves ... was sacrificed to the rock .
how the people cried .
but when the fires burnt out ... he ordered vinegar to be poured on the hot rock .
and ?
it cracked .
nordo , you' re a genius .
you cannot beat the rock ... unless you use the strength of the rock ... against itself .
the advantage of the roman army is size and discipline .
but if you force their lines together , if you crowd them ... their strength becomes their weakness .
the rock will break against itself .
if the slaves don' t move out of those woods soon ... drive them out with the archers .
gannicus , your cavalry ... will attack the roman cavalry on the wings ... and destroy them or draw them away .
next we drive off their skirmishers with slings and arrows ... and then you , david , will charge the roman center .
on my signal , break ranks in the middle of your line ... fall back as if in a panic ... and make them believe you' re running for your life .
the romans expect us to run ... and will charge after you into the center .
crixus , you wait for my signal , not a moment before .
enough talk .
let' s fight .
tell the skirmishers to move .
skirmishers !
send in the first line .
first line !
since when do slaves fight with cavalry ?
stop the romans !
slings and arrow !
now !
hold your positions !
stay firm !
they' re killing them !
stay where you are !
signal the retreat !
retreat !
they' re breaking , my lord .
finally .
allow the men to follow at will .
and take no prisoners !
i killed him !
publius maximus is dead !
where is the rest of the roman cavalry ?
those we didn' t kill we drove off .
in which direction ?
south , i think .
we' ve left the camp unguarded !
give me a horse !
varinia !
varinia !
varinia !
we could .
we ... we ...
it' s all right .
what are you doing out here ?
thinking .
you shouldn' t be off by yourself like this .
am i in danger ?
she' s carrying my child .
i was trying to pray ... but i don' t know who to pray to .
my people pray to a god who doesn' t answer .
who leaves it up to us to decide how to behave .
a good god for a free man .
not when answers are what you need .
maybe that' s the price we pay ... to live in a world where we get to choose .
what is it ?
crixus .
why should we leave ?
rome threw their best at us ...
and we slaughtered them .
we cannot fight ...
the whole roman army .
let them come .
i will hammer them to an early grave .
and when we' ve destroyed their armies ... we will be kings !
we' re with you !
yeah !
unless , of course , you haven' t got the stomach for it .
in that case ... run away .
no one here will stop you .
if we separate , we will be destroyed .
no .
crixus is right .
he is right !
how clearly my wise brother crixus sees the future .
why should we run ?
but let' s not settle for a little plunder .
let' s turn south ... march to the sea and cross the straits to sicily .
the slaves there will surely join us ... and we' il be kings of the island , the breadbasket of rome .
and they' il come crawling to us , begging for mercy .
who is with me ?
spartacus !
who is he ?
what kind of man am i dealing with ?
everybody blames me for this mess .
nobody has suffered like i have .
i' m ruined .
i' ve lost everything .
my villa burned down , my slaves went away , the school ... and thirty years of work destroyed .
perhaps this will ease your suffering .
thank you , my lord .
spartacus ?
yes , yes .
you met him once , spartacus .
he was one of two pairs you hired a year ago ... to entertain cornelius and helena lucius .
terrible thing , their murder .
i never trusted him .
my trainer cinna thought the world of him ... but i always saw that he was trouble .
too much pride .
i heard rumors that spartacus was wed .
you mean varinia ?
that bitch from hell disguised as an angel .
i never get sentimental about slaves .
i mean , they' re animals , nothing more .
but those two , they worked something out .
you could see it when they looked at one another .
how did he become a slave ?
they say that ... as a young boy ... he watched his father crucified .
his father .
if we split up before we' re ready for orsino we' re doomed .
our strength is in our numbers .
we could go .
just you and i.
leave them to this madness if that' s what they want .
we are entitled to a life .
these people put their trust in me .
how can i desert them ?
you are an honorable man .
but if you are dead it will be of little comfort to your son .
what else do i have to leave him but my honor ?
two legions destroyed !
and now the slave army ... glutted with blood and victory turns south ... perhaps to sack rome herself .
we have listened to the fainthearted for too long .
no more half measures .
i pledge ... upon the sacred honor of my ancestors ... to raise and equip six full legions ... at my own expense .
i will lead this army myself ... and i will stamp out this rebellion ...
for once and for all .
yes !
noble senators !
do not rise to this honeyed bait !
what crassus proposes is nothing less than a private army ... answerable only to himself .
consider the consequences to the republic ... if one man were to be given such terrible power .
consider the consequences ... if spartacus gets inside these city walls .
this is no longer a mere question of pride ... or economic impact .
our national security is at stake .
our very lives .
only a fool or a traitor ...
could oppose such measures .
yes !
crassus !
crassus !
crassus !
crassus !
soldiers of rome ... never before has the republic been more in need ... of your courage , your strength ... your determination .
our lives , our families ... civilization itself ... stands at an abyss ... on the brink of destruction .
and i say to you ... that every man here today simply do his duty ... as i have no doubt he will ... and we will defeat the evil at hand .
history has given us this role ... and we will fulfill it .
there can be no hiding place ... for those who would strike terror ... into the heart ... of the greatest nation known to man !
three cheers for marcus crassus ... the savior of rome !
crassus !
crassus !
crassus !
don' t the legions traditionally cheer rome when they depart ?
crassus thinks he is rome .
we may win this battle with the slaves ... but lose the war over rome' s soul .
we need to enlist some allies .
caesar will help .
he has a much more practical approach to politics .
you mean he can be bought .
contact him , flavius .
tell him i wish to correspond ... with pompey the great .
we will meet in three months ... and then you will ferry the entire army across the straits to sicily .
i suggest we meet at calabria .
there' s no roman garrisons nearby , i' il bring the boats closer ... where it will be easier to load your people .
the next installment .
the rest you get when we reach sicily .
orsino ?
if you betray us i' il find you wherever you go ...
and i' il kill you myself .
unless you are killed .
glabrus and publius maximus underestimated me too .
it didn' t end well for them .
i have no reason to betray you , spartacus .
you' re richer than any roman ... and far more generous .
spartacus , rome has sent a new army against us .
i think you better see this one for yourself .
the camp looks heavily fortified .
how many legions ?
i count six standards .
commander ?
we caught one of their scouts .
their general is marcus crassus .
crassus .
you' re uneasy , my lord ?
he' s out there ... somewhere , as we speak .
the slaves took over a fort barely ten miles from here .
their scouts are watching us .
no .
no , no .
he is watching us .
spartacus .
i can feel it .
spartacus .
attack , attack , attack !
is that your answer for all ?
it is a warrior' s answer ...
not the slave' s .
have a care , gaul , how you talk ...
or i' il cut that throat .
enough .
we dealt with publius .
we can deal with this .
publius was nothing compared to this .
and how do you know ?
we' ve met this man .
he paid a fortune to watch men from different tribes fight to the death .
this is a merciless , calculating man ... commanding what you can be sure is the best army money can buy .
but he still bleeds red , and i say attack !
and i say no , and i' m still the commander here !
for now .
for now .
when it' s time to fight , we' il be glad he fights with us .
our position is good .
i say we wait and let crassus come to us .
he' s picked a good solid defensive position ... and he shows no signs of leaving it .
he wants us to come to him .
and we will .
is that wise ?
both glabrus and publius played into his hands .
exactly .
i will advance as he expects me to , with three full legions ... the arrogant roman falling into his trap .
however , you and mummius will take the other three legions ... and you will place yourselves behind him .
we will penetrate his defenses from front and behind ... and we will trample them like daisies .
listen .
do not , under any circumstances ... attack without my command .
crassus has mobilized and his men are marching against us .
they don' t seem to be in any hurry to get here .
halt !
have the men rest for an hour .
i don' t want them wearing themselves out .
i want fresh limbs for the slaughter .
mummius and servius must be given plenty of time ...
to get into position .
yes , my lord .
stand the men down !
look at them .
they have no idea we' re here .
i' il send word to crassus .
why share the glory that could be ours alone ?
spartacus !
we' re being flanked !
they' re attacking from the rear !
but in order to do that he had to split his forces .
how long do you think before they reach our front lines ?
two , maybe three hours .
time enough .
grab your weapons !
you come in good time .
the attack begins shortly !
my lord ... the troops under servius and mummius have been destroyed .
the generals have been taken prisoner .
we have your general , crassus !
where' s your great roman army now , crassus ?
what' s next ?
you' re next , crassus !
tell the men to withdraw !
what shall we do with these great roman generals ?
kill them .
kill them ?
who would throw away a fortune ?
aristocrats .
sons of important families .
what would rome pay to have them back ?
we could live well on the ransom .
you speak of ransom like we' re thieves .
these men made whores of our daughters ... and gladiators of our sons .
i say they would have us fight for their entertainment .
we should make them fight for ours !
fight !
this isn' t justice .
this is revenge .
don' t lie to yourselves .
animals !
there can be no greater shame ... for a roman soldier ... than cowardice in the face of the enemy .
our founding fathers understood this ... and they had an answer for it .
decimation .
count off !
fight !
fight !
fight !
fight !
fight like a man !
kill !
kill !
every tenth man step forward .
now wipe away the shame ... that stains your honor ... and the glory of rome .
you executed one hundred and fifty of your own men ?
roman citizens ?
discipline distinguishes the roman army ... from every other army in the world .
discipline ... or brutality ?
and where is spartacus now ?
traveling south , tracked by my troops .
his goal remains unclear .
but i believe ... that he means to move against sicily .
noble senators , we need not dwell long ... on noble crassus ' failure .
let him retire in disgrace ... and let us recall pompey and lucullus ...
at once .
recall them as you wish ... but retire me ... at your own peril .
it will take weeks for pompey to move his troops .
do you think that spartacus will sit ... and wait patiently for him to arrive ?
he is a contaminating parasite .
and he crawls from limb to limb ... and organ to organ ... until the great body of this republic ... has been brought to its knees .
now then ...
i may not meet agrippa' s exalted standards ... as commander in chief , but for better or for worse ...
i am your only miracle .
i am your only cure .
it' s all a bluff on crassus ' part , don' t you think ?
he' s beaten .
for someone who' s just suffered a humiliating defeat ... he seems very sure of himself .
crassus has something up his sleeve .
the question is what ?
orsino .
may i offer you something to eat ?
no .
thank you .
i had just finished my lunch when ...
your invitation arrived .
sit down .
i expect that you' re aware of our dilemma ... with the so called slave army .
along with the rest of the world .
i have concluded ... that the slave general spartacus ... intends to leave by sea .
and why would you conclude that ?
because it' s all he can do .
and because he seems to show ... an inordinate interest in plunder , leading me to wonder ... what he is planning to buy or whom .
i' m afraid i can' t help you .
yes you can , you will .
i can' t believe you' d disturb the carefully arranged understanding ... between my people and yours for a group of slaves .
consider the long range costs .
spartacus will leave the country ... or he will die .
either way , he will be gone .
whereas rome and i ... shall still be here .
and you will be made to suffer the consequences .
rome has no navy .
i' il build one .
because either you are with me ... or you are against me .
the coastline of calabria .
set up the signal .
let them know we are here .
how long do you think it will take them to get here ?
by tomorrow .
time enough for us to catch our breath .
hurry up or i' il have the lot of you whipped !
get that in here !
spartacus !
they' ve gone .
it' s a trap .
it' s a trap !
archers !
i' ve got you now , you son of a whore .
get back to work !
fight , starve , or surrender .
those are our choices .
we' re trapped .
we' il never get past that wall .
perhaps we can make a deal .
rider approaching !
stand down !
lower your weapons !
spartacus !
i' m told i saw you fight once .
i remember .
i don' t particularly .
but then ...
i have seen so many gladiatorial contests in my time ... and all slaves do look alike .
except for who cuts your throat .
i wouldn' t try that .
there are archers on the walls behind me .
you wouldn' t stand a chance in hell .
i have a proposition for you .
my people go free .
they leave the roman empire ... and i surrender to you .
i can' t accept those conditions .
unconditional surrender for all of you ... man , woman and child .
where did you acquire the arrogance to believe that you could ... challenge the undefeated roman empire ?
i have you to thank .
that day at capua .
draba ... the man who tried to spear you .
i don' t understand .
he inspired you ?
he showed me how to fight back .
but you , roman , you gave me a reason .
i don' t need to negotiate .
your food can' t last .
like cornered rats , you' ve nowhere to run or to hide .
and i have all the time in the world .
do you ?
my scouts tell me that pompey has been recalled .
what glory will be left for you when he arrives ?
i will destroy your army ... and then i will wipe away even the memory of your existence ... from the face of this earth .
that is your fate .
and this is yours .
help me !
for the love of rome , marcus !
i will cut down every tree in this land ... and then i' il erect crosses enough ...
for you and your mongrel tribe .
look for me in battle , roman .
i' il be looking for you .
i' m yours .
how could you do this ?
how could you crucify ?
the romans need to be reminded that we are not beaten .
and our people need to be reminded of the price of defeat .
you' re becoming one of them .
i' m not the oppressor here .
that' s supposed to justify it ?
we fight for more than just lives .
this is about survival .
yours , mine , our child' s , everyone' s .
and i will do what i must to assure that .
speak for yourself .
for me , for our son .
it' s not worth it .
they need to be light .
light but strong .
these need to be longer .
fifteen feet will do it .
get it done .
very long .
my lord , they' re attacking the wall !
where ?
north .
near the bay of euphemia .
move all of our available troops there .
now !
yes .
sound the alarm !
weapons ready !
wait !
wait .
it' s not him .
lower your arms .
and while crassus was distracted by the flaming livestock ... the army of spartacus climbed the walls and escaped .
i' d have paid a lot to see crassus ' face when he found that out .
meanwhile , pompey has landed at minturnae .
may i ask the cost to bring that ?
well , it was very expensive ... but it was worth it .
pompey will defeat spartacus and then claim all the credit as usual .
crassus will be denied his victory .
and if we' re very lucky ...
spartacus will defeat them both .
to the south , crassus follows close .
while to the north pompey and his legions have landed .
we should turn and attack .
attack crassus ?
insane .
not crassus or pompey , but rome .
it' s the last thing they' d expect .
with good reason .
you won' t scale rome' s walls with a rope and a ladder .
no .
we will march north .
avoid pompey as much as we can and get over the alps ...
like we should have done before .
so it' s my fault now , is it ?
who led us to the trap at rhegium ?
orsino .
no .
spartacus .
you chose me as your leader !
well , no more !
in my tribe , any man can challenge for the role of king .
no , david , this is my fight .
put your weapons down , both of you .
this is foolish .
i beg you please , don' t do this .
you were right , varinia .
it was always going to come to this .
we need you , crixus .
crixus doesn' t need you .
crixus doesn' t need anyone !
where will you go ?
where my feet take me .
have you enough food ?
lf we don' t , romans will give us .
we made rome tremble , didn' t we ?
who else can say that ?
no one .
we march !
my lord , all the gauls under crixus ... have left spartacus ' army .
they' re marching on their own .
where are the gauls headed ?
they' re making camp on the shores of lake lucania .
and with pompey at least two days ' march away , he can' t know this .
it' s not your fault .
he chose his own path .
i failed him .
i failed you all .
lucullus and five more legions have landed at brindisium ... not more than a day' s march north and east of here .
we might have been able to slip past pompey ... but not both pompey and lucullus .
we can' t go forward .
we can' t go back .
and we can' t wait for these three armies to join ... or we' il be crushed between them .
tomorrow we' il turn and attack crassus .
maybe we can catch him off guard .
he who stops to loot is executed .
nothing slows us down .
the child is well ?
i think he will be a blacksmith , the way he hammers on me .
i want you to promise that whatever happens to me tomorrow ... that you will live .
that you won' t take your own life .
and be a slave again ?
you haven' t the right to ask that of me .
but i do .
there is no life without you .
i am not important .
not to me ?
not to your son ?
you were right , varinia .
vengeance alone is not enough .
to become like your enemy is to lose to him .
and what' s important isn' t our living or our dying ... but this new thing we' ve created , however briefly ... a world without slaves .
and if you die , who will tell that story ?
live so that i will live .
so that we will live on .
so that it won' t be wasted or forgotten .
and i promise you ...
i' il always be with you .
look .
that' s where i will be .
know that i' il always be there .
forgive me .
i overslept .
we brought you a present .
he' s beautiful .
fit for a king .
i' m not a king .
i' m something better .
a free man .
i thank you for your generosity .
but i' il fight beside you , and your fate will be mine .
if we win , we' il each have a horse of our own .
and if we lose , we won' t need them .
you' re the finest soldiers in the world .
and it has been an honor to fight with you !
spartacus !
spartacus !
spartacus !
spartacus !
spartacus !
spartacus !
spartacus !
spartacus !
spartacus !
spartacus !
spartacus !
this is crixus ' way of battle .
no fancy tactics .
head on .
one strong arm against another .
don' t be greedy !
crassus is mine !
for rome !
spartacus , time to die !
freedom !
the baby !
it' s started .
it' s all right .
spartacus , you have a son .
we found her !
we found the wife of spartacus !
take him .
stay !
varinia ?
we think he was a close friend of spartacus .
what is your name ?
speak !
i won' t lie to you .
you' re going to die .
but yours can be a painless death .
i can do that .
crucify the prisoners .
my lord , there are upwards of six thousand .
all of them .
yes , my lord .
you will watch them die ... and you will be the last .
and when you are nailed to the cross , hanging there ...
i will be there .
pompey' s troops are nearby and have captured the slaves who escaped us .
pompey is on his way to rome to claim your victory as his own .
pompey !
pompey !
pompey !
pompey !
i merely did what any son of rome would do .
you do me too much honor .
they' re just slaves , after all .
senators , we must not in this overlook ... the noble crassus .
caesar makes an excellent point .
crassus has certainly played a part ... a very workman like role .
and he certainly deserves some public recognition .
not a triumph perhaps .
maybe an ovation , our secondary honor ... such as we sometimes give to a victorious athlete .
indeed .
now is the time to be generous .
an ovation for crassus .
i have fielded and equipped ... six full legions .
i have led them in battle myself .
i' ve endured enumerable hardships .
and i have stamped out ... the greatest threat ... that rome has known since carthage .
and i am to be rewarded ... with some trivial , secondary honor ?
senators , this is a day for rome to rejoice .
for romans to forget our differences and unite .
the position of consul remains vacant ... because for too long political rivalries ... have prevented us filling it .
and now for candidates could there be ... any more qualified , more deserving ... than these two glorious heroes ?
and therefore i propose ... that pompey and crassus both be made consul .
co consulship .
i would be honored ... to serve with marcus crassus .
if it is the senate' s wish .
this would be highly irregular .
never in the republic' s history ...
new times require new measures .
what say you , senators ?
yes !
why won' t you speak with me , varinia ?
what was he like , spartacus ?
what was he like ?
he was just a man .
a simple man .
no .
he was a professional killer .
he was an outlaw .
and he was an enemy of everything fine and decent .
if you already have the answer to your question then why ask it ?
because you waste your tears on him .
in five years ... we won' t even remember his name , i promise you .
then why does he still matter to you ?
spartacus was something the world has never seen before .
he was something different .
he was the way that people might be if they chose .
i can be something different .
i can be ...
i can be someone else .
yes .
please love me .
love me .
he was something that you could never be .
kill !
kill !
kill !
kill !
no !
do you like the way it ends ?
i am spartacus !
get out .
get out !
here i am .
do you still have nothing to say ?
i will be back .
and i will be millions .
don' t look at me like that .
i' ve lost , flavius .
rome has lost .
outflanked by that toady caesar .
don' t you mean crassus ?
caesar is the real beneficiary here .
tell me some good news .
there is none .
crassus has turned the appian way into a graveyard .
six thousand crucifixions i hear .
whole forests cut down .
the tree lovers will be up in arms .
the stench of rotting flesh is unbearable .
but the corpse ... is rome' s .
civilization hangs on the cross .
what have we done ?
now tell me some dirt .
gossip .
i hear that crassus has secretly taken ...
spartacus ' wife varinia ... and keeps her and spartacus' s child locked away in his house .
treats her like gold they say , but she scorns him .
even now , this varinia ?
war trophy , i imagine .
can i have a drink ?
help yourself .
i would pay a lot ...
to steal her .
are you out of your mind ?
it would be suicide .
two million sesterces .
we bestow upon laius pompey and marcus crassus ... the honorable and noble title of co consul of the roman empire .
from this moment on ... you are all ... free .
here on the table is a scroll for each of you ... declaring you legally ... free .
do not imagine ... for one uneducated moment that i am unaware ... of how you and caesar ... denied me my rightful triumph .
you know why i am so much more popular than you , crassus ?
because it' s only natural to prefer the rising sun ... to the one that sets .
leave us .
we haven' t much time , agrippa .
wait outside .
why have you done this ?
at first , it was just a thumb in crassus ' eye .
but the more i thought about it , well ...
a foolish old man' s last gesture ... of redemption maybe ?
after i sobered up yesterday ...
i started to meditate as to how a handful of slaves ... could almost defeat the greatest military power in the world .
do you know what i think ?
i think that you fought for your freedom ... for your children' s lives ... the honor of your women ... and all that is good in the world .
and rome fought for what ?
the whip and the cross .
i love rome , but she' s become a whore .
i despise what she is , but i' m too old to leave her .
and in truth , i helped to make rome what she has become .
agrippa , we have to go .
yes , get the chariot ready .
what is your son' s name ?
spartacus .
spartacus .
you shame me .
you shamed us all .
flavius will lead you .
he is as loyal a roman as money can buy .
having thus imparted my sentiments as they' ve been awakened ... by the occasion which brings us together , i shall take ...
where is agrippa ?
that pimp ?
who cares ?
where is she ?
where is she ?
you' re safe now .
thank you .
good luck .
and that is how we came here .
and how does the story end ?
i don' t know , spartacus .
it becomes your story now ... and you must find your own ending .
