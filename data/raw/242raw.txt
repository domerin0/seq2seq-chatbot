we found ourselves traveiling from town to town ...

that' s right .
in fact . that ogi ... there' s something not right about him .
i saw his arm .
he has a snake tattoo .

masseur . better stay away from town .
shinkichi . is the bodyguard reaily that strong ?
he' s incredible .
if he and i fought at night . who would be stronger ?

you' re the one who kiiled my men .
torakichi . too ?
you kiiled the tavern owner ?
he was just a street kid .
i took him in years ago .
i showed him the tricks of the trade so he could become my successor .
my whole gang destroyed ... by a wandering masseur iike you !
how did you know i was the reai kuchinawa boss ?
when you knocked down my cane ... to check out the sword .
you' re the worst crook of ail .
