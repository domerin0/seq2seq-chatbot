listen , here' s the thing .
if you can' t spot the sucker in your first half hour at the table , then you are the sucker .
guys around here' il tell ya ... you play for a living .
it' s like any other job .
you don' t gamble .
you grind it out .
your goal is to win one big bet an hour , that' s it .
get your money in when you have the best of it , and protect it when you don' t .
don' t give anything away .
that' s how i' ve paid my way through half of law school .
a true grinder .
see , i learned how to win a little at a time .
but finally , i' ve learned this ...
if you' re too careful , your whole life can become a fuckin ' grind .
this is teddy kgb' s place .
five hundred .
you won' t find it in the yellow pages .
nope .
not tonight .
no ?
what ?
give me three stacks of high society .
thirty thousand .
count it .
that' s good .
so , you' re sitting the apple .
good .
want a cookie ?
no .
he doesn' t look like much , but kgb is connected all the way to the top of the russian mob .
he' s the one guy in the game you don' t want to fuck with .
but if you' re looking for high stakes , this is the only place in town .
they all know me as a small timer , but that' s about to change .
joey knish is a new york legend .
he' s been a rounder , earning his living at cards ... since he was 19 years old .
what are you , holdin ' those for somebody ?
uh , yeah , i' m holding ' em for you .
you should be .
' cause i hope you' re not thinking of putting all that glimmer in play .
he' s as close to a friend as there is in this place .
come here .
but tonight , i don' t want to see him .
now , you don' t wanna butt onions with these guys .
' cause they' il chew you up , take your whole bankroll .
so you say .
there' s plenty of easy games .
we get outta here , get some coffee , ride over to that soft seat in queens .
i know what i' m doing .
you' re making a run at it , aren' t you ?
rolling up a stake and going to vegas .
i' m right , right ?
i can beat the game .
maybe .
maybe this is a game can be beat .
but you know you can beat the 10 20 at the chesterfield and the hi low ... at that goulash joint on 79th street .
okay .
i understand .
i understand .
back to battle .
the game in question is no limit texas hold ' em .
minimum buy in $25, 000 .
a game like this doesn' t come together often outside the casinos .
the stakes attract rich flounders , and they in turn attract the sharks .
no limit texas hold ' em is the cadillac of poker .
each player is dealt two cards face down .
five cards are then dealt face up across the middle .
these are community cards everyone can use to make the best five card hand .
the key to the game is playing the man , not the cards .
bet an eight ball .
there' s no other game in which fortunes can change so much from hand to hand .
a brilliant player can get a strong hand cracked , go on tilt ... and lose his mind along with every single chip in front of him .
this is why the world series of poker is decided over a no limit hold ' em table .
some people , pros even , won' t play no limit .
they can' t handle the swings .
but there are others , like doyle brunson , who consider no limit the only pure game left .
like papa wallenda said ... " life is on the wire .
the rest is just waiting .
pass it to you .
all right , i raise .
i' m gonna raise five hundred .
fold .
it' s a position raise .
i call it .
here' s the beauty of this game .
go ahead .
i just got top two pair on the flop , and i want to keep him in the hand .
against your average guy , i' d set a bear trap , hardly bet at all .
let him walk into it .
but kgb' s too smart for that .
so , what i' ve got to do is over bet the pot , make it look like i' m trying to buy it .
i bet $2, 000 .
then he plays back at me , and i get paid off .
call .
my guess is teddy' s on a flush draw .
burn and turn .
there' s my money card , nine of hearts .
i got a full house .
to the bettor .
check' s good .
now i hope a spade falls and teddy makes his flush .
that way he' il bet strong , and i' il beat him with my nines full over aces .
i' m going to bet ...
bet ... $15, 000 .
time .
i want him to think that i' m pondering a call , but all i' m really thinking about is vegas and the fucking mirage .
all right , your 15 , plus i have another 33 to raise you .
um ...
yeah , i' m gonna go all in , ' cause i don' t think you got the spades .
you are right .
i don' t have spades .
i know before the cards are even turned over .
aces full , mike .
get up .
come on .
come on .
want some ?
no .
i' m down to the felt , knish .
i lost everything .
man , i lost my case money .
i lost my tuition .
it happens to everyone .
time to time , everyone goes bust .
you' il be back in the game before you know it .
i' m done .
i' m out of it .
they all say that at first .
hey , man , let me stake you .
standard deal , you know .
fifty percent of your winnings .
if you lose , it' s on me .
i' d just throw it away .
you still got the truck ?
sure .
come on .
you don' t hear much about guys who take their shot and miss , but i' il tell you what happens to ' em .
they end up humping crappy jobs on graveyard shifts , trying to figure out how they came up short .
see , i had this picture in my head .
me sitting at the big table , doyle to my left ,
amarillo slim to my right , playing in the world series of poker .
and i let that vision blind me at the table against kgb .
now , the closest i get to vegas is west new york , driving this lousy route handed down from knish ... to rounders who forget the cardinal fuckin ' rule ...
always leave yourself outs .
hey , moogie .
let me ask you a question .
in a legal sense , can fuckin ' steinbrenner just move the yankees ?
does he have the fuckin ' right to just move them ?
i don' t know .
how should i know that ?
you didn' t learn that yet ?
no , we get to steinbrenner in the third year of law school .
oh .
take care , man .
yeah .
the judges ' game .
i' d heard about it for years on the street , before i was even in law school .
a rotating group of ten or twelve judges , prosecutors and professors .
they all have money , and in my playing days ... it would have been pretty sweet to have any one of them owing me favors .
only problem is , no one can get in the game anymore .
one rounder , crispy linetta , sat under some pretense , but they found out he was a pro , he couldn' t cross the street without a legal hassle .
even his regular club , vorshay' s , got shut down .
place had been open since 1907 .
oh , michael .
you got some things for me ?
yes , i do .
put ' em on the desk , it' s all right .
kid , he paying you for this late night shit ?
oh , well , knowledge is my reward , sir .
let me tell you , it ain' t worth it .
why don' t you become a jockey , do something useful .
kid' s a little tall , isn' t he , gene ?
enough with the belmont recruiting spiel .
your bet .
all right .
i call .
michael is lead counsel ... in the moot court you' re presiding over next week , gene .
besides , he could use the background if he' s gonna ... clerk for one of you fellas this summer , right ?
abe , i thought you liked the kid .
why do you want to make him a civil servant ?
yeah , look ... a word to the wise .
stay in the private sector .
that nassau defense attorney' s game ?
they use our chips for coasters .
the amazing thing is , in this collection of great legal minds , there isn' t a single real card player .
i call .
raise .
um , the professor raises .
mike ?
michael , i would have just called .
no , you' re good .
all right , i call .
i don' t know if i' m going to bring my legal career to a crashing halt ... before it even starts , but i just can' t help myself .
good .
i' m in .
read ' em and weep .
threes check .
check to martin and lewis over there .
check to the raiser .
czechoslovakia .
what' s the limit ? $20 .
big bet' s $20 .
okay .
good .
there' s $20 .
you' ve seen half a hand .
how the fuck are you betting into us ?
you sure this is wise , abe ?
it' s your money the kid' s bettin ' with .
it' s plenty wise .
we know what we' re holding , and we know what you' re holding .
the fuck you know what we all got .
summer clerkship in your office says i know what you' re holding .
i don' t bet with jobs like that .
let' s just say i' il put you at the top of the list if you' re right .
okay .
well , you were looking for that third three , but you forgot that professor green folded it on fourth street , and now you' re representing that you have it .
the d. a. made his two pair , but he knows they' re no good .
judge kaplan was trying to squeeze out a diamond flush , but he came up short , and mr. eisen is futilely hoping that his queens are gonna stand up .
so , like i said , the dean' s bet is $20 .
well , kiss my ass .
kiss my ass .
what' d you have , abe ?
nothin ' but a busted straight .
oh , come on .
it' s good enough to win .
take it down .
all right , kid , your first assignment .
pull up a seat next to me .
oh , i' d like to .
i can' t , i can' t .
i don' t play cards .
get outta here !
see you tomorrow .
whose deal ?
my deal .
i like the kid , abe .
good kid .
smart kid .
i tell ya , it' s hard leaving that game .
an open invitation to lay with those lambs .
but i' m retired .
the truth is , i can always find games , though .
easy games , tough games , straight games , crooked games , home games .
i can turn this truck onto the jersey turnpike and be at the taj in two hours .
but i' ve made promises .
i' m just a law student now .
hello ?
hey .
hey .
how' d it go ?
oh , great .
i am sick of that fucking route .
don' t worry .
a few more semesters ...
mmm .
oh , i gotta go .
i' m really late .
oh , just stay here .
i' il be really quick .
you won' t feel a thing .
we both know that' s not true .
besides , you should get some sleep .
these fuckin ' long nights are killing me .
they never used to .
yeah , well , that' s different .
i mean , that was like ... buy in at 8 : 00 , next thing you know it' s morning .
but hey , you know , i think i' m hooked up for this summer .
hooked up how ?
well , after i left you last night at the library , i impressed judge marinacci .
i think i might be in line for a clerkship .
tell me more .
well , those guys were all playing cards , and ...
just hear me out now , hear me out .
they were playing cards and i read his hand blind .
so , instead of coming home , you went and played cards with some judge ?
no , i wasn' t even playing .
they were playing .
i just caught his eye by reading his hand , that' s all .
i mean , as long as i don' t fuck up moot court , i think the job' s mine .
what kind of job is that gonna be , mike ?
writing an opinion on high stakes poker ?
honey , you' re the one who told me ... that i should use my poker skills in the courtroom .
yeah , i know i said that , but ...
you know what i meant .
i meant that you should use your head .
you know , the way you calculate odds on the spot , the way you read people .
that' s what i meant .
i didn' t mean that you should try to con your way into a summer job .
honey , con ?
i was networking .
oh , god .
networking .
are you trying to con me now ?
no .
i just ...
i don' t think you get it .
you' il be just like one of those ex college athletes .
you know , great job at the d. a. ' s office as long as ... they never miss a lawyer' s league game .
it' s true .
i just think if you get in this way , you' il always be a hustler to them .
baby , i didn' t even play .
okay .
i' il see you later .
oh .
hey , hon , can i take the jeep tomorrow ?
yeah , where ?
uh , worm' s gettin ' out .
i was gonna pick him up .
tomorrow .
beautiful .
i promised i' d be there , hon .
worm .
i just can' t believe you still know someone called " worm .
he' s like my brother .
shit .
i didn' t even play .
i met worm at dwight inglewood preparatory academy over in jersey .
we were the only two kids attending who didn' t have a trust fund .
my father' s office was there .
it said " custodian " on the door .
that' s why they took me .
pow !
w was that , like , your strong finish or something ?
motherfucker !
you leave me no choice , the way you play .
that' s the fourth time you done played that bitch of spades on my ass .
no , no , no , no , no .
dowling had it three hands ago , and two hands ago i got the black maria , so i don' t want to hear you bitchin ' , okay ?
yeah , but he shot the moon on that hand , didn' t he ?
yeah , i saw that .
so it helped you .
now ...
okay , you' re right .
you ain' t walking outta here with our grits , worm .
you know the drill , okay ?
i' m not gonna smoke ' em .
i' il hold on to ' em . if you want ' em back , you can trade me for ' em , or try to play double or nothing tomorrow .
murphy !
what the hell you sittin ' there for ?
you' re processed .
come on .
processed ?
this motherfucker' s gettin ' the jump .
come on , man , have some decency here , worm .
you can buy all the smokes you want in half an hour .
what are you talking about ?
i won these fair and square .
you don' t even smoke , worm .
jesus , you guys are such fuckin ' babies .
you know that ?
if you' re determined to die of cancer , you really oughta learn how to play cards .
ain' t a good idea to add insult to injury , yo .
that shit will come back and hurt you .
you know what ?
not in this lifetime .
enjoy your time .
murphy .
worm' s dad did the grounds , when he wasn' t too fuckin ' drunk .
that' s when we did ' em .
of course , the grounds weren' t all we did .
worm put us into a scam a day on all the young aristocrats we went to school with ... selling ' em dime bags of oregano , nunchakus and firecrackers from chinatown .
where' s the rest ?
kept us in lunch money .
thank you .
until the time we went for ... more than just pocket change and got caught .
we had the starting five take a dive against friends academy .
the point guard snapped and gave worm up .
they hauled him up before the school board , offered him a deal .
tell us who else was involved , and we' il go easy on you .
worm didn' t say a fuckin ' word .
got himself expelled .
i stayed in school and graduated .
crank the outside .
not many guys would stand up for a friend like that .
ta da !
mike mcd .
god .
i knew you' d be here .
aw , man .
you never let me down .
i would have been there every week if you let me , man .
i know , i know .
i couldn' t let you see me in this shit hole .
look at you .
you look great , man .
you too , you too .
did they toughen you up in there ?
no , no .
it was a piece of cake .
piece of cake .
man , look at your ride .
you' ve been prospering while i' ve been away .
what have you been up to ?
i borrowed it .
whatever .
just get in it and drive me far away from here .
there' s like two whole economies in there ... there' s cash and there' s trade .
so i gotta keep three games going at once , all right ?
a game with the white guys , a game with the brothers , and a game with the guards .
and the trick is , i gotta take enough cash off the white guys ... to lose it to the guards so that they keep doing me favors and shit , but i gotta trim enough smokes off the black guys that i can trade and keep myself ... in the style that i' ve grown accustomed to , and all of this without getting my ass kicked .
so you' re working with a partner ?
no .
who the hell am i gonna trust in there ?
it' s just me all alone .
what' s this ?
come here .
you like that ?
isn' t that beautiful ?
what is that ?
it' s like an ace up my sleeve .
what else ?
wait till i show you some of my chops , man .
i' ve gotten pretty blinding .
it' s like , it' s like , you know ...
all right .
it' s gonna blow your mind , blow your mind .
you been working ?
is your game sharp ?
no , man , i' m off it .
what , are you ... you gettin ' cold cards ?
no , man , i mean i quit .
what , are you shitting me ?
no , man , i ...
i got cleaned out .
mike mcd ?
you lost ?
yeah , man , i ...
it was a real blood game over at kgb' s place .
you sat down with the mad russian and he emptied your pockets ?
yeah .
i didn' t want to tell you while you were in there .
i didn' t want to dispirit you like that .
jesus , what were you thinking ?
so , you' re just a student now ?
what are you doing for money ?
i' m driving knish' s truck .
oh , god , you' re killin ' me .
mike , mike , we gotta get you back on the game .
the old partners here , we' re gonna run like ...
no , no , no , i' m off it .
i mean , i really am .
done .
you are , huh ?
all right .
i know a game perfect for the two of us .
it' s a berry patch right outside new york city ... prime pickings .
i' il drop you ...
i' il drop you off .
okay .
i mean it .
no , i' m really off it .
i know , i know .
this is it , this is it .
so get this , here' s the plan .
i know this girl barbara .
she' s fuckin ' hot .
i was this close to bangin ' her when they sent me away .
she works as a hostess for all these fuckin ' trust fund babies in here .
she got me into their little game .
she introduced me as her cousin from out of town who loves to gamble but wants to learn poker .
that sounds solid .
that' s a nice hookup .
it' s all the way nice .
there' s only one problem .
i got this feeling .
what feeling is that , exactly ?
you know this feeling very well .
you know , when you got your table all set .
uh huh .
knife , fork , sauce , a 1 , luger' s , but ...
yeah .
you just don' t have the stake .
exactly .
glad you understand .
a nickel would start me very nicely .
whoa , jesus , what have you been livin ' on ?
i' m livin ' a little light , i told you .
anyway , that' s $220 , so that' il get you started . $220 , i mean ...
hey , thanks , but i mean , that' s , like , 11 bets .
i mean , i can' t even get a table on this ...
good , so forget this game .
i' il straighten you out in the city tomorrow .
no way .
i gotta get started .
i mean , i' m already behind here .
you just got out .
what' s the big fuckin ' hurry ?
the hurry is , other than you , my friend , there' s about five guys ,
like , eagerly awaiting my release .
how much do you owe ?
like , ten .
ten ?
i can' t even figure it with the juice .
hey , look , i can get started on this easy if it' s you and me working together .
i heard you asking before , and i hear you asking now , but i can' t do that .
i just can' t do that .
i' ve made promises .
hey , you know what ?
what am i saying ?
i totally understand , i do .
it' s fine .
i' il make a couple of moves earlier than i would have normally ...
but thanks , i appreciate it .
premium hands .
i' il catch you in the city tomorrow ?
yeah .
hey , mike , man .
fuckin ' great to see ya .
you too .
in confessions of a winning poker player , jack king said ,
few players recall big pots they have won , strange as it seems ,
but every player can remember with remarkable accuracy ... the outstanding tough beats of his career .
seems true to me .
' cause walking in here ,
i can hardly remember how i built my bankroll , but i can' t stop thinking of how i lost it .
mike .
hi .
barbara .
worm said you' d be running a little late .
just follow me .
i probably won' t even sit .
you know , just kinda keep him company .
no , no , that' s not gonna work .
here' s the play ... you' re my new boyfriend , you' re looking for a regular game .
really ?
well , i' m not much of a card player .
bullshit .
worm tells me that' s precisely what you are .
my cut is 25 per cent .
i see .
good .
come on .
gentlemen .
this is my boyfriend michael .
hello , michael .
be nice to him .
leave him enough money to buy me breakfast .
good luck .
thanks , sweetie .
here , why don' t you pull up a chair .
okay , this one' s chicago .
you know chicago ?
uh , remind me .
stud game .
high spade in the hole wins half the pot .
okay , well , deal me in , i guess .
that' s you .
oh , thanks .
okay .
that' s two on you , murph .
oh , yeah .
sorry .
i' m in .
i' m gonna make it five .
hey , big spender .
worm and i fall into our old rhythm like clyde frazier and pearl monroe .
we bring out all the old school tricks , stuff that would never play in the city ... signalling , chip placing , trapping .
we even run the old best hand play .
raise .
i can probably crack the game just as quickly straight up , but there' s no risk in this room .
now , some people might look down on worm' s mechanics , call it immoral .
but as canada bill jones said , " it' s immoral to let a sucker keep his money .
like they teach you in one l ... caveat emptor , pal .
i got the boat , queens over .
he asked you if that stung , birch .
worm really has become an artist , too .
discard culls , pickup culls , overhand run ups , the double duke ...
his technique is flawless .
but his judgment is a little off .
a few times , i have to fold the case on him , just so it won' t be obvious .
still , he plays the part of the loser to perfection .
flush .
i got the full house .
i got the queens over the aces .
ahh , fuck !
you know what ?
fuck you and your never ending string of boats , okay ?
hey .
well , my uncle les says when the money' s gone , it' s time to move on , so enjoy it , you secret handshaking assholes .
murph !
hey , come back any time .
your money' s always good here .
good night , mike .
see you next time .
you guys , uh , wanna keep playing ?
how' d we do ?
oh , beautiful .
fuckin ' assholes , they deserved it .
all right , $300 , that' s your cut .
thank you very much , boys .
hey , you were great .
great .
when can we do this again ?
no , no , it was a one time thing for me .
just because .
forget it .
uh , two weeks .
two weeks ?
okay .
okay .
hey , thanks a lot .
yeah .
hey , i had to try , right ?
bye .
hey , how' d you know i was coming back ?
that' s easy .
who' s your favorite actor ?
clint eastwood .
the outlaw josey wales , man .
the man with no name .
he always doubles back for a friend .
hey , we made good time .
wanna get breakfast ?
no , i gotta get home .
if she hasn' t already changed the locks on me .
just do me a favor .
give me five minutes .
get me straightened out .
this may not look like teddy' s place , but it ain' t the ivy leagues either .
so don' t fuck around .
you gotta play on your belly .
all right .
no problem .
hey , you know i have no problem with the way you help yourself , but these guys are fast company .
they' il spot every move .
tough customers , huh ?
yeah .
i' m serious .
all right .
you won' t just get a finger up your spine .
okay , i hear ya .
i' m playing straight .
michael mcdermott .
how you doin ' , mikey ?
good , how you doin ' ?
good .
you know , um , the computer tried to delete you last week .
oh , yeah ?
but i knew you' d be back .
oh , no , i' m not back , i just ...
it' s good to see you .
good to see you , too .
um , this is les murphy .
he' s like my brother .
call me worm .
hey .
don' t wiggle away .
hey , what' s she wearing the button for ?
they' re wired right into the precinct .
they got ' em on the payroll .
what are they playing ?
uh , 20 40 forced rotation .
it' s the only game going right now .
is that fat greggie sitting 20 40 ?
the game' s that soft ?
yeah .
it' s a real live game .
so , you guys gonna play ?
no .
hell , yeah , i' m gonna play .
oh , come on , you' re not gonna walk away from this .
not gonna happen .
mike , we could cut this room up in an hour .
all right , run along , then .
say hi to her for me .
me , too .
i will .
take care of him .
jesus .
what a fuckin ' waste .
do you believe that ?
she' s really got him by the balls .
that' s not so bad , is it ?
depends on the grip .
come on , give me $2, 000 .
on the finger ?
you heard mike .
he' s good for it .
come on .
look , i' m gonna triple that in half an hour , princess .
let' s go .
okay .
hey .
reunion run a little late ?
i was gonna call , but i didn' t want to wake you up .
it' s okay .
i wasn' t sleeping .
well , why don' t you change and we' il get a cab .
um , why don' t you just go ahead , and i' m gonna jump in the shower .
and if i miss a little bit of the mulligan meeting , just cover for me , all right ?
hey .
at least give me a story .
you know , i mean ...
i mean , tell me you were out drinking till you threw up .
tell me you were getting lap dances over at scores .
i don' t care , just give me something .
i was entertaining worm .
uh huh .
the least i can do for the guy .
so , you were nowhere near a card game .
sweetie .
what ?
i' m asking you a question .
i' m just ...
no .
i was nowhere near a card game .
all right ?
all right .
i' il wait for you .
i mean , the key is a seamless passing of the baton among the team .
i think the most important thing is to be respectful to the judges but not obsequious .
now , wait a minute .
make sure to be deferential .
gene marinacci won' t buy deferential .
oh , it' s gene , is it ?
well , i knew there was a reason why you were lead counsel , and it' s got nothing to do with your punctuality .
sorry .
i couldn' t find a cab .
anyway , when you make the opening remarks , make sure you stick to the fact pattern .
and use the right cites .
use book cites , not lexis .
hi , jo .
long time .
knish .
how are you ?
the same .
i don' t mean to interrupt you future magistrates and noblemen , but i , uh , i need a word .
um ...
it' s important .
okay .
excuse me .
sorry .
i' il act as lead counsel .
it' s all right , kelly .
we were gonna take a break anyway .
coffee time .
the guy' s a cheat .
he always has been .
right now , he' s over at chesterfield' s , ruining your reputation ... with every lousy second he deals .
shit .
i told him .
did anybody else see him ?
nobody saw ...
i heard it .
snapping sound gave it away .
i didn' t know him , i might not have noticed .
i turn around , and i see him with the mechanic' s grip , i know .
you want one ?
did you give him the office ?
i tried to warn him , but he looked right through me .
all right , i' il go get him .
no , no , no .
he' s okay now .
most of those georges are at the tail end of a 36 hour session .
they can' t see straight .
come on , i' il buy you a cup of coffee .
but if he' s still there when roman and maurice start their game , he' s gonna wish he was still inside .
i' m gonna go get him .
amarillo slim , the greatest proposition gambler of all time , held to his father' s maxim ...
you can shear a sheep many times , but skin him only once .
gotta bet my jacks .
this is a lesson worm' s never bothered to learn .
hey , guys .
english only at the table , no russian .
what are you talking about ?
what am i talking about ?
if you want to see this seventh card , you' re gonna stop speaking fuckin ' sputnik .
oh , da , motherfucker .
you' re worried we might work together .
i' m sure you' re just talking about perogies ... and snow and shit , but let' s cut it out , all right ?
there' s the river , down and dirty .
i think you got that ace , roman , but i' m gonna pay for it .
okay , well , i got the jacks .
come on .
ace .
oh , you got it .
and six .
wow , two pair .
but i got sevens , too , though .
with my jacks .
motherfucker , slow rolling me like that .
you said just jacks .
but you made me for the sevens , maurice .
you' re a player .
fuck !
hey , come on !
don' t be a fuckin ' baby .
hey , maurice .
hey .
hey , mike , you here to play ?
come on , we need some new blood .
they' re putting a fucking bracelet on me tomorrow for four months .
i already stuck two racks .
well , have a good rest , man .
can i talk to you for a second , cosmonaut ?
no , man , i' m on a roll .
this is a very emotional game .
gotta do it .
i counted these .
leave it .
it' s fine .
what' s going on ?
where are you at ?
i was pumped up eight g' s .
i was ready to go on a run when you came along .
all right , listen .
hey , wait , i want a hot dog .
you' re in town for five fuckin ' minutes , you already got a sign on your back .
oh , what , that fuckin ' knish rat me out ?
you gotta stop listening to that guy , man .
he sees all the angles , but he doesn' t have the balls to play one .
hey , that guy hasn' t had to work in 15 years , worm .
you don' t think that' s work , what he does ?
grinding it out on his fuckin ' leather ass ?
no , thank you .
i thought so , too , all right ?
now i know what real work is .
speaking of which , are you even gonna get a job ?
or are you just gonna go back to printing those credit cards ?
huh ?
you gonna go away again ?
i wasn' t printing .
i was distributing .
distributing .
it' s different , okay ?
second of all , i' m never going back there .
stop worrying so much , okay ?
come here .
i just want you to think long term , all right ?
be smart .
every place in manhattan , they all keep books , all right ?
if you get listed as a mechanic , then not only are you gonna get the shit kicked out of you , you' re not gonna get a fuckin ' game anywhere in new york .
it' s stupid .
it' s just bad business .
look , this is what i love about you ... you think about the big picture .
that' s great , okay ?
but it' s not me .
i don' t play the game straight up , and then if i lose , go get some real work or something , okay ?
i see a mark , i take him down .
that' s what i do .
that' s the way i live .
i know .
listen , you' re the guy who taught me all the angles .
but i' m not the guy with my nose open right now .
aw , come on .
i' m not gonna preach to you , but those two guys in there , they' re not rabbits .
roman and maurice ?
they' re russian outfit guys .
not as bad as kgb , but you don' t want to be fuckin ' with those guys .
with those fake versace shirts and shit ?
jesus .
look , you still got time .
just go back in there , right ?
lose their fuckin ' money back to ' em , all right ?
just make it look good .
just catch a run of real shitty cards .
give it back to ' em .
i can' t .
i can' t .
i gotta put some scratch together , man .
i gotta get somethin ' going .
then go out to suburbia , man .
play in a fuckin ' dentist' s game , okay ?
go to swan meadow , play in the golf pro game .
that' s an idea .
i' il definitely do that , but i can' t dump to these guys .
you got to .
all right , whatever , whatever .
meet me at stromboli' s in half an hour , all right ?
i can' t , i gotta go .
i have a meeting .
and then i gotta go to fuckin ' queens .
i gotta load the truck .
jesus , man , you' re such a fuckin ' workin ' man now .
i' m never gonna see you .
make it look good .
i mean it , make it look good .
you know me .
so , how' d you do ?
ah , so so .
six thousand , two thousand .
oh , hold on .
two more .
all right , so it' s ten grand total , take back the two we lent you , give you the white meat .
you know what ?
why don' t you give me all of it ?
usually , credit players only leave with their profit .
otherwise , the juice starts five points a week on mike .
oh , okay .
we' il owe you .
hey .
i' ve been looking all over for you .
didn' t want to be found .
you know , petrovsky waited and waited .
so did the rest of the group .
jo , look , i missed one meeting .
it' s not about the meeting .
i don' t care about the meeting .
do you even know why i left this morning ?
i found that gangster' s roll in your pocket .
it' s not what you think .
it' s not what you think .
who do you think i am ?
you lie right to my face ?
look , old days at least you never lied .
you lost everything , but at least you never lied .
jo , this wasn' t even a real game .
this was like wiffle ball .
can you lose your rent playing wiffle ball ?
no , i couldn' t lose .
that' s the point .
no , mike , you can lose .
i watched you , i stood by you while you lost everything before .
i don' t think i can go through that with you again .
jo , i wasn' t gonna lose !
why does this still seem like gambling to you ?
why do you think the same five guys make it to the final table ... at the world series of poker every single year ?
what are they , the luckiest guys in las vegas ?
it' s a skill game , jo .
great .
so why' d you have to lie to me ?
because i knew you wouldn' t understand .
understand what ?
last night , i sat down at this card table .
i felt alive for the first time since i got busted at kgb' s joint , okay ?
you just told me you felt alive for the first time at a fucking card table .
no , what ...
what' s that supposed to make me understand ?
midnight , gettin ' uptight where are you
you said you need me but it' s quarter to 2 : 00 i heard you was out .
hey , fuckin ' grama .
how you doin ' ?
i was just thinkin ' about you .
you know , i could use you .
oh , yeah ?
see me in , like , two weeks .
i' il put you back on the payroll .
well , i got some bad news for ya , worm .
i' m out on my own now .
really ?
yeah .
go figure .
there were a lot of angry people when you went away .
a lot of people were mad .
i know , grama , that' s why i' m trying to put together a roll here .
a lot of people coming up to me , asking if i could help , asking if i knew where to find you .
so , it got me to thinkin ' .
really , you thinkin ' now ?
that' s big .
hey , jesus !
come on !
take it easy .
it' s just a friend of mine .
hey !
easy , easy , easy , easy .
god !
get the fuck outta here .
what did i say ?
hey , man , take it easy !
get the fuck outta here !
okay .
here' s what i' m thinkin ' .
instead of you owing 15 grand spread out to five guys , you owe 25 to me .
what ?
where the fuck do you get off ?
25 grand ?
where the fuck do i get off ?
ohh .
here' s how it is .
25 grand , and the juice is still runnin ' .
jesus christ .
what the fuck are you doin ' , man ?
you were my partner .
no , no , i was your lackey .
but i learned a few things , worm .
i consolidated your outstanding debt .
where' d you get the scratch for that ?
you' ve been rolling fags in the village again .
still a wise ass .
unbelievable .
what i did was go partners with an old friend of yours .
teddy kgb backed me .
bullshit .
bullshit .
teddy' s got plenty of goons .
why would he put you under his flag ?
because as soon as he heard your name , he became real excited for the prospect .
what , so you bought me up , grama ?
yeah , got a real sweet deal , too .
30 cents on the dollar .
there' s not a lot of faith in you out there in the business community .
great , so you' re a banker now , grama .
that' s really classy .
not exactly .
i don' t have to tell you my collection methods .
oh , god .
all right , look .
just take it easy , all right ?
i' il scrape something together , and i' il find you this week .
that' s just what i figured .
no , no , no .
so i' m gonna take what you got on you right now .
here .
fine .
have yourself a ball , okay ?
god !
damn !
excuse me .
mind if i sit ?
michael .
please , please .
sit , sit .
that was a nifty trick the other night .
it was wonderful .
thank you .
marinacci and the d. a. were ready to cut cards for your services at that point .
of course , it was an altogether different trick , that disappearing act ... you pulled today at your group' s meeting .
yeah .
well , i figure i owe you an explanation .
ah , not to me .
i' m sure there' s a good reason you left .
you' il just have to work harder .
prepare .
and smooth things out with the others .
right .
yeah .
okay .
okay , well , thanks .
stay .
take a drink .
jamie ?
yeah ?
another glass , darling .
sure .
what are you drinking ?
gin .
always gin .
here you go .
thanks , dear .
thank you .
i know a magician doesn' t divulge his secrets , but ...
i' m no magician .
well , if it wasn' t magic , how did you know what everyone held ?
it' s a combination of things .
um , i was watching when the cards came out .
that' s ...
that' s just an old habit with me , like breathing .
you watch the cards .
i watch the cards also , but i watch the players reacting to the cards .
that' s how i knew the d. a. made his two pair , and judge kaplan missed the flush .
i was watching their eyes when they checked their river cards .
their faces tell you everything .
you watch the man .
i ...
i never knew you had to calculate so much at cards .
all right , here' s the thing .
you only play premium hands .
you only start with jacks or better split , nines or better wired , three high cards to a flush .
if it' s good enough to call , you gotta be in there raising , all right ?
i mean , tight , but aggressive .
and i do mean aggressive .
that' s your style , professor .
i mean , you gotta ... you gotta think of it as a war .
you are officially never invited to our game again .
i don' t blame you .
put a guy like me in a game like that , the cards don' t even matter .
i' il play it blind .
michael ,
may i tell you a story ?
please .
for generations , men of my family have been rabbis .
in israel , before that in europe .
it was to be my calling .
i was quite a prodigy .
the pride of my yeshiva .
the elders said i had a 40 year old' s understanding ... of the midrash by the time i was 12 .
but by the time i was 13 ,
i knew i could never be a rabbi .
why not ?
because for all i understood of the talmud ,
i never saw god there .
you couldn' t lie to yourself .
i tried .
tried like crazy .
i mean , people were counting on me .
but yours is a respectable profession .
not to my family .
my parents were destroyed , devastated by my decision .
my father sent me away to new york ... to live with distant cousins .
eventually , i ...
i found my place , my life' s work .
what then ?
i immersed myself fully , i studied the minutiae ,
i learned everything i could about the law .
i mean , i felt deeply inside that it was what i was born to do .
and did your parents get over it ?
no .
i always hoped that i would find ... some way to change their minds , but ...
they were inconsolable .
my father never spoke to me again .
if you had to do it all over again , would you make the same choices ?
what choice ?
the last thing i took away from the yeshiva is this ...
we can' t run from who we are .
our destiny chooses us .
hey .
l' chayim .
hey .
hey , where you been ?
i' ve been freezing my ass off .
what happened ?
ah , ran into a door .
don' t worry about it .
what happened ?
hey !
she crossed her legs too fast , all right ?
just mind your own business .
you comin ' up ?
no , i' ve been standing out here all this time just to say hi .
listen , things haven' t been that smooth on the home front , so tone it down a little , all right ?
tone down what , motherfucker ?
great .
never mind .
when you become a big shot lawyer , could you find us an elevator building ?
shut up .
what , did you get robbed ?
um , not exactly .
wait , wait , wait .
did she split on you ?
oh , god .
oh , my god .
mike , she made off with your sheets .
i always told her she' d be a good card player .
know exactly when to release a shitty hand .
come on , mike , forget that .
this girl is obviously wrapped way too tight for living .
no , she was a good ...
i knew it .
i fuckin ' knew it .
it' s depressing .
you can' t trust ' em .
you can' t trust ' em at all .
i mean , look at you .
you domesticated yourself for this girl .
you took yourself out of the life .
you walked the fuckin ' line for her .
and the minute you want a little of it back , she walks out on you .
it' s just like the saying says , you know ?
in the poker game of life , women are the rake .
they are the fuckin ' rake .
what the fuck are you talking about ?
what saying ?
i don' t know .
but there oughta be one .
you know what cheers me up when i' m feelin ' shitty ?
what ?
rolled up aces over kings .
that right ?
yeah .
check raising stupid tourists and taking huge pots off ' em .
yeah ?
stacks and towers of checks i can' t even see over .
playin ' all night , high limit hold ' em at the taj .
where the sand turns to gold .
fuck it , let' s go .
don' t tease me .
let' s play some fuckin ' cards .
the poker room at the mirage in vegas ... is the center of the poker universe .
doyle brunson , johnny chan , phil helmuth ...
the legends consider it their office .
every couple of days a new millionaire shows up ... wanting to beat a world champion .
usually they go home with nothing but a story .
down here , the millionaires are scarce or they' re playing craps , but there' s still plenty of money for the taking .
in fact , on the weekends you can' t get a game in the city , because all the new york rounders are taking care of the tourists here .
hey , hey , why don' t you warm up a seat for me .
i' il catch up with you .
what ?
look .
i got certain needs i gotta attend to , okay ?
hey , good .
i mean , i' m overdue .
good , man , hey , i was startin ' to wonder about you .
i thought , maybe , you know , the boys upstate brought about a few changes in you .
hey , in your dreams , lover .
hey , mikey !
hey .
hey , mike .
this is beautiful .
welcome to the chesterfield south .
ho !
changing $500 .
come all the way to atlantic city just to see your mugs , huh ?
twice in one week .
for someone who don' t play , you spend a lot of time in card rooms .
this is what i like to see , huh ?
mike mcdermott where he belongs ... sittin ' with the scumbags .
tellin ' jokes , draggin ' the occasional pot .
occasional ?
yeah , like my ex wife occasionally went out with other men .
forget her , face .
i was actually gonna try and make some real money tonight .
but in honor of mike' s alley like return to the ring ,
i' il sit with you all for a while .
hey , don' t do us any favors , knish .
they' re about to go to the board to fill these seats .
bet it .
i raise .
you know , if we wanted to take each other' s rolls , we could have just stayed home .
these two have no idea ... what they' re about to walk into .
down here to have a good time , they figure ... why not give poker a try ?
after all , how different can it be from the home games ... they' ve played their whole lives ?
all the luck in the world isn' t gonna change things for these guys .
they' re simply overmatched .
we' re not playing together , but then again , we' re not playing against each other either .
it' s like the nature channel .
you don' t see piranhas eating each other , do you ?
they wear their tells like signs around their necks .
facial tics , nervous fingers .
a hand over a mouth .
the way a cigarette is smoked .
little unconscious gestures that reveal the cards in their hands .
we catch everything .
if a fish acts strong , he' s bluffing .
if he acts meek , he' s got a hand .
it' s that simple .
how are you , you workaholics ?
worm .
good to see ya .
glad you' re out .
number' s changed , of course .
lotta games this weekend , so you' re gonna need the number .
i' il give you a ring .
hey , worm ?
do they allow people like you in places like this ?
zagosh , when you get yourself a job , then you can be my fuckin ' p. o.
how about that ?
now , let' s get started , shall we ?
i' m sorry , sir .
you can' t take chips from another player at the table .
we all know each other here .
we' re like friends , so if nobody complains , do you have a problem ?
it' s all right .
no problem .
sir , you have to buy ' em from me .
fuck this low limit shit .
can we go get something to eat ?
i got comped at the noodle bar .
i want to talk to you .
look who' s treatin ' to a free meal .
don' t let that m. s. g. fuck up your head more than it is , mikey .
you keep grinding out that rent money , joe .
it' s noble work you' re doing .
so , hey , uh , nick the greek .
what' s with kitin ' my checks ?
i' m on empty , that' s why .
you are ?
you' re tapped again ?
i mean ...
how much was the hooker ?
mike , please .
relaxation therapist .
okay ?
it' s not where it went .
wait a minute .
it went to roman and maurice ?
i told you , man , you didn' t have to give it all back to ' em .
take a little money for your time , you know ?
hey , that' s not where it went either .
i ran into grama tonight .
yeah ?
yeah .
he took everything i had .
you' re kiddin ' me .
wait , who' s he working for ?
well , he' s sorta out on his own .
this fucker went around and bought up all my debt .
grama .
that turncoat motherfucker .
are you kiddin ' me ?
so what do you owe him ?
i don' t know .
by his crazy fuckin ' gorilla math ?
like , 15 .
fifteen ?
fifteen ?
yeah , i mean ...
he says the juice has been running the entire time on my ten .
so , it' s just like ...
why didn' t you tell me that , man ?
why did you not tell me that ?
i could have paid that off .
i had the ...
i had the money .
hey !
i' m not gonna sit in the can and have my friend paying down my debt .
i' m not a leech , all right ?
we can help each other , like always .
that' s why we' re here .
that' s ...
that' s why we gotta get in the bigger game .
do you hear what i' m saying ?
all right .
all right .
listen , man , i' il help you .
you know i' il help you , man .
yeah ?
i mean , fuck that guy .
we' il figure something out .
yeah .
how long should we wait ?
i suggest we wait another five minutes , and then choose another lead counsel .
here he comes .
mr. mcdermott , perhaps we can begin now .
i' m so sorry i' m late .
come to order in the matter of slater v. new york state higher education services .
the facts have been stipulated , the briefs have been read .
lead counsel for plaintiff , mr. mcdermott , please proceed with oral arguments now .
if that is convenient for you .
yes , it is , and again , i' m sorry , ah , that i' m late .
um ...
well , i think clearly the , uh ... the case which controls the issue at bar would be , uh , texas v. johnson ,
which holds ...
texas v. johnson ?
mr. mcdermott , that is a supreme court free speech case ... that has no bearing in the premises .
each group was apprised to ignore that aspect of this matter ... and focus instead on the idea of de facto segregation .
right .
um , well ...
mr. mcdermott has been unreachable , so i' il take over , if it pleases the court .
someone saying something meaningful would please us a great deal .
what we have here is a clear case of gerrymandering , impacting schoolchildren and schools in the district ... that was created solely to separate students by race .
although not dispositive , the student body is more than 99 percent white .
well , that was impressive .
usually you have to know something about a case to give an opening statement .
guys , what ... what can i say ?
hey , it worked out great for me , mcdermott .
i think i actually impressed marinacci .
jo .
jo .
jo .
what ?
we' re not gonna talk ?
you left me pretty quick there .
you make it sound as if it was my decision .
well , it wasn' t mine .
i came home and you were gone .
you were just gonna drop me like that ?
i learned it from you , mike .
you always told me that this was the rule .
throw in your cards the moment you know they can' t win .
fold the hand .
look , this is our thing that we' re talking about .
it' s not some losing hand of poker .
i know exactly what we' re talking about , mike .
so , that' s the last of it , then ?
yeah .
i mean , i' d say good luck , but i know it' s not about luck in your game .
eric seidel cannot win this hand , and yet he doesn' t know it .
chan is trying to sucker him in by taking his time .
oh , look at that look of the defending champ .
and now fifth street , a six of diamonds .
no help .
johnny chan has a queen high straight .
will eric seidel fall for the bait ?
yes , he' s going all in , and chan has him .
johnny chan , the master ...
yes , he' s going all in , and chan has him .
hello .
oh , hey , mike .
it' s petra .
can i come up ?
yeah , i' il buzz you in .
well , that' s the important thing with the game of hold ' em .
you' re never down and out until your chips are all gone .
hey .
hey .
how you doing ?
good .
man continues speaking ]
i haven' t seen the place in a while .
looks about the same .
you want some scotch or something ?
no , i' m fine .
oh , ' 88 world series , huh ?
yeah .
johnny chan .
flops the nut straight and has the discipline to wait him out .
he knows seidel' s gonna bluff at it .
and yet he doesn' t know it .
johnny fucking chan .
chan is trying to sucker him in by taking his time .
look at the control .
look at that fuck .
he knows his man well enough to check it all the way ... and risk winning nothing with those cards .
he owns him .
will eric seidel fall for the bait ?
yes , he' s going all in and chan has him .
johnny chan , the master .
poor seidel .
kid doesn' t know what hit him .
yeah , i know what that feels like .
it' s like a locomotive running through your stomach .
you feel gut shot .
fuck it .
you didn' t come here to talk about this .
what' s going on ?
tomorrow' s a week .
a week of what ?
the first two thousand you owe the chesterfield .
oh .
worm .
yes , it' s kinda weird .
he' d just won eight grand .
why go on the line behind another two ?
so , he took , what , about eight off of roman and maurice ?
yeah , yeah , he comes in after you leave , sits for like another 20 more minutes , cashes out for the full amount .
maurice hasn' t been back since .
i think he' s been playing across the street .
but , uh , worm' s been around plenty .
he' s run you up just under seven grand .
well , do me a favor and just put him on his own .
yeah ?
yeah , cut him off .
um , i tell ya , i got a thousand .
i got a thou .
and that' s , you know ...
i just started coming back , so ...
thanks for making it easy , mike .
oh , yeah , yeah .
i' m , uh ...
i' m sorry to be back over here for this reason .
don' t worry about it .
no , i ...
i like being here .
it' s good to see you , mike .
i can stay .
listen , i tell ya , i' il ...
i' il , um ...
i' il come ...
i' il come ...
i' il see you down at the club .
i' il come by this week .
yeah .
i know you' re in here .
mike ?
hey .
i thought you were the janitor , man .
it' s a good thing grama doesn' t know you as well as i do .
come on .
i' il play ya horse .
fifty bucks a letter .
yeah ?
when i win , are you gonna pay me back with my own fucking money ?
oh , oh , easy .
relax .
don' t wing it .
just ...
just step and throw .
you need to work on your accuracy .
will you stop fucking around for five goddamn minutes for once in your fucking life !
whoa , jesus .
what happened ?
my old man just walked in the door .
i should fucking beat the shit out of you the way he used to .
you remember when we found this place , man ?
yeah , i remember when we found this place .
you were hiding from tommy manzy ' cause you thought he was gonna fucking pound you into oblivion .
yeah , now , see ?
what did i ever do to that guy ?
you fucked his mother .
yeah , but she was a good iooking older woman .
you gotta give me that .
you spent a year of your life hiding in this fucking gym from that sick fuck ... until he pissed off the wrong guy and someone dropped a garbage can on his head .
what do you want me to say ?
those were wild times .
you were there too .
nothing' s changed .
nothing has changed .
you were hiding from your troubles then .
you' re hiding from your troubles now .
i like to hide , and that' s part of the fun for me , you know ?
i don' t like running solo .
it' s like i used to have a running partner , you know what i' m saying ?
if we fucked up back then and got caught , the worst thing that was going to happen was maybe catch a beating , get expelled .
but , man , you' re fixing to go down hard , and it almost seems like you want to .
stop worrying so much about me , okay ?
i' m turning things around .
i' m not gonna let anybody drop a garbage can on my head .
no , no , you' re gonna get out of the way .
it' s gonna land on me .
i' il see ya .
come on , mike .
hey .
come on , come on , come on .
i' m sorry , okay ?
i' m sorry about the money .
i should' ve told you .
it' s just ...
what do you want me to say ?
it' s fucking embarrassing .
i , like , just get out , i' m in a big fucking hole .
i need something to get goin ' .
i gotta get started .
and ?
well , i' m not gonna lie .
there' s been some reversals .
some reversals .
how much money do you have ?
nine hundred .
i mean , i caught a frozen wave of cards like you fucking read about .
i think i' m getting you outta hock , i find out i' m seven grand in .
i know , man .
i was really ...
i was really up big .
i was cruising along .
i tried to beat that blackjack game at the horseshoe club in brooklyn .
that place is a mitt joint .
i know .
it was , like , ouch .
i' m so stupid .
i got so good with this , i thought i could neutralize ' em .
you' re really jamming me up here , man .
seven grand .
i know .
that' s it .
i can' t go any deeper than that .
you' re off the tip .
i understand .
that' s okay .
and you gotta talk with grama .
you gotta square things away with grama .
no way , mike .
i' m not talking to that fucking judas .
you think there' s any other way ?
i know all the reasons i shouldn' t be here , but sometimes reasons don' t matter .
you see , no one' s ever stood up for worm .
the guy' s been kicked around his whole life , from his father on down .
maybe he' s not the same guy he was when he went away , but i can' t give up on him that easy .
i' m all he' s got .
oh , what the hell .
hi , boys .
hi .
you cops ?
you look like cops .
we' re not cops .
you wanna twirl then ?
no , no , we' re just here to see grama .
jesus .
you sure about this ?
i got a bad feeling .
that' s all right .
just ...
just let me do the talking , all right ?
hey , grama .
long time .
mike .
hey , worm .
it' s good you came .
that' s real smart thinking .
so , did you bring him along to help carry all my money ?
uh , there' s no money today .
no money ?
there' s gotta be some money .
come on .
get outta here .
he' s not kidding .
i got nothing .
you owe 25 .
i' il take the rest in five days .
five grand in a week , and you keep the juice going ...
shh .
quiet .
you gotta catch ' em in the act .
get in your hole , you bitch !
christ .
fucking dog .
you can' t let ' em get away with it or else they think they run the place .
so , where were we ?
five grand .
in a week .
grama , we want what you want .
we wanna square this thing .
but three days ... three days is impossible .
all right ?
no one' s saying you' re not the man .
just think of this as a business decision .
look , he just got out .
let' s put him on a plan .
no , no , no , no , no .
this isn' t the money store .
we' re not negotiating here .
i tell you how it works .
well , then , i' m asking .
so , you' re looking for a little grace , lester , some charity ?
you know what , grama ?
i need your fucking charity like i need your cock in my ass .
shut the fuck up !
it' s too late for him to shut up .
hey , listen !
he' s good for it .
he' s good for it , mike ?
if you think he' s good for it , it' s on you too .
then it' s on me too .
fifteen large , five days , or i start breaking things .
i hear ya .
get the fuck outta here .
piece of shit .
now , what the hell are you doing ?
i' m not gonna get down on my knees for that jerk off .
all i said is just keep your mouth shut for five seconds .
shit .
i' m sorry .
goddamn it .
that' s it .
i' m really sunk now .
no , 15 grand in five days .
i can do that .
i' ve gone on rushes like that before .
ah , under optimum conditions with a bankroll , maybe .
but what have you got on you ?
got , like , 350 .
ah , that' s 1, 200 between us .
we might as well play the fucking lotto .
no , man , no .
listen .
find the games , scout ' em out , i sit , i mop ' em up .
you know , we might have a shot at this ... if we sat together and just did our thing .
i' m not gonna do that .
i' m gonna do this straight up .
oh , fuck , man .
i mean it .
well , where do you wanna start ?
there' s a 30 60 at the chesterfield .
come on , listen ... there' s the 4 : 00 a . m . in woodside .
there' s the greeks .
all right , there' s a union game in jersey .
i know a guy whose cousin can get us in .
all right .
there' s four .
there' s a cigar shop in brooklyn .
it' s like an easy clean .
there' s a golf pro game in riverdale .
that' s six .
you sure you' re up for this ?
i' m fucking up for this .
an 80 .
i bet the full amount .
the full amount , huh ?
well , let me look at you here .
nope .
you didn' t do it this time .
i' m gonna raise you .
i don' t know .
the bet' s 50 .
i kinda like this robusto .
a nice , nutty finish .
i love the cameroon wrapper on this baby .
nice and oily .
i' il call .
what do you got ?
i have what' s known as the wheel .
it' s got earthy tones , a smooth draw , enough kick to win me the hi and the lo .
call .
trip aces .
l ...
i only got a pair .
jacks .
what did you think he had ?
does he look like a man beaten by jacks ?
jacks are a monster compared to the crap you play , taki .
ah , fuck you .
fuck you .
fuck me ?
fuck you !
it' s only money .
i bet .
then let' s get some in there .
make it five .
you' re raising me 300 , kid ?
i call your 300 .
how much is in there , weitz ?
about 1, 500 .
1, 500 .
here' s a thousand .
there' s 500 .
i bet you the pot limit , kiddo .
are you sure on that , goldie ?
you might want to leave a little something for your daughter' s riding lessons .
there' s a lot more where that came from , weitz .
take it down .
i got shit .
i bluffed the big ringer .
let' s go .
let' s go .
get up .
get off your ass .
we' re done .
come on .
anytime , anyplace , anywhere ...
oh , by the way , anybody .
buy some real jewelry , you fucking cheap bastard .
unbelievable .
what were you doing in there ?
i didn' t have it .
you didn' t have it ?
since when you have to have it to take a pot off a hump like that ?
a grade schooler would' ve played back at that guy .
i was waiting the guy out .
eventually , he was going to bluff at the wrong pot .
i was gonna take him .
we don' t have time .
that guy was papier mache .
you gotta make strong moves .
the move was folding .
i can' t lose what i don' t put in the middle .
oh , jesus , you know what ?
fuck all that ' cause we needed that pot .
well , what are we up to ?
that' s like seven .
seven .
with that pot you just dumped on that fucking v neck sweater , we would' ve had ten .
look at you .
one 64 hour session , and you need a nap .
no time for a fucking nap .
no , we don' t .
that' s all right .
come on .
i know what you need .
i know ...
i got just the place for you .
yeah , yeah .
feel like i' m gonna get whacked sitting here like this .
we got 7, 300 , mike .
we gotta double that in two days .
well , we' re gonna get close .
i' m sure if we come up a little short , grama ...
we come up even a little short ,
grama will shoot us and bury us in a hole somewhere .
now , i know this game up in binghamton .
in binghamton ?
yeah , yeah .
it' s like 16 or 17 guys .
two full tables .
all municipal workers .
they come play right after they get their paychecks .
it' s very fat .
are you sure ?
binghamton' s five hours each way .
well , look , i figure there' s 15 or 20 grand in that room , okay ?
if we get even half of that , we' re home .
lead me to it .
municipal workers , huh ?
what ?
these guys work for the city .
they work for the state , you idiot .
oh , this is just stupid .
look , we' re here , okay ?
you got any better ideas ?
how the hell am i supposed to even get in this game ?
no , it' s easy .
the whole time i was in the joint , i was just dumping money to guards .
this one guy , pete frye , i probably lost like ten grand over 18 months .
i mean , he thinks i' m a total fish .
he told me anytime i wanted a game when i got out , just look up his nephew .
you just go in there , you ask for sean frye , you' re in .
you' re gonna clean this game up .
these guys are total suckers .
all right .
give me , like , eight hours .
come back at 7 : 00 , 7 : 30 .
what am i gonna do for eight hours ?
why don' t i come in ?
i' il sit for a little while .
no .
no , not a chance .
i' il sit at the other table and play straight .
you wanna play straight ?

he' s saying you' re dealing off the bottom of the deck .
oh , god .
come on , guys .
what did he give him ?
to me ?
seven of hearts .
you boys professionals ?
you working ?
i was winning before this guy got here .
okay , okay .
let' s let the cards do the talking .
if the seven didn' t help you , we' il listen to what you have to say .
ozzy , turn the cards .
come on !
it' s three of a kind !
shut up !
i' m just sayin ' , it' s three of a kind .
one last thing , stu .
scumbag !
hey , all right , take it easy .
aren' t you supposed to read us our rights ?
here' s your fuckin ' rights !

worm .

hey , you all right ?
mike ?
yeah .
you should' ve played those kings , mike .
aw , you' re an asshole .
i know .
i know .
i' m sorry .
they took every fucking nickel .
i think i got 300 in my boot somewhere .
oh , look at you .
fuck !
fuck , i cannot believe i caught a hanger .
aw , it' s never happened , i swear to god .
where' s the car ?
god , i think i cracked a rib .
what the fuck were you thinking ?
i was trying to give us an edge .
i had ' em .
hey , i' m sorry we got banged up , all right ?
i took a shot and i missed .
that happens .
fucking happens all the time around you .
what , it doesn' t happen to you ?
you' re the guy who flushed his whole fucking bankroll on one hand , mike .
oh , hey , fuck you , man .
that was different .
why ?
explain that to me .
why different , huh ?
what makes you so fucking special ?
how come all your moves are so smart and noble ... and i' m always the idiot piece of shit ?
you act like you' re the only one with any fucking ambition .
what' s your ambition , man ?
tell me .
i don' t know .
what is it ?
i don' t even know .
i don' t think like that .
no , you don' t think .
no , i don' t think like you !
you always think you can beat the game straight up .
that' s not me .
i told you , i' m always gonna look for that edge .
always .
what' s the edge now ?
we owe 15 grand in a day .
what do we do ?
it' s easy .
we get the fuck outta dodge , all right ?
we just steer clear of the city for a while .
we' il hit the road .
we' il be up again in no time .
this' il all blow over .
we' il have a ball .
not a fucking chance i' m gonna live like that .
you talk to grama .
you get him to stake me .
it' s not gonna work , okay ?
we' re not dealing with grama .
you said grama' s on his own .
you told me grama' s on his own .
kgb bankrolled him .
so you' ve just fucked us right in the ass .
yeah , all the way , okay ?
so you see what i' m saying ?
no fooling around .
it' s highway time .
are you with me or not ?
no , i' m not this time .
give me the keys .
you' re really gonna go back there ?
yeah .
i' il see you when i see you .
hey .
at least you' re rounding again , right ?
you' re gonna thank me for that someday .
fold or hang tough .
call or raise the bet .
these are decisions you make at the table .
sometimes the odds are stacked so clear , there' s only one way to play it .
other times , like holding a small pair against two over cards , it' s six to five , or even money , either way .
then it' s all about feel , what' s in your guts .
well , look at you .
look at me .
come in .
no .
where' s your friend ?
uh , he' s gone .
he' s gone .
so you brought my money ?
i' m a little short .
how short ?
the whole way .
there must be some kind of story .
well ... as you can see , i can' t pay you .
i see you' re banged up pretty good .
you never should' ve vouched for that scumbag .
maybe not .
you' re leaving me no outs here .
why ?
i can' t trust you two aren' t playing me .
i' m not the one working with a partner here .
you wanna take it up with kgb , you go right ahead .
otherwise , you got one day , or this' il feel like a swedish massage .
hey .
hey , what' s up ?
you look like duane bobick after one round with norton .
what the fuck happened to you ?
ah , worm .
when are you gonna listen ?
i' m listening .
what do you need ?
500 ?
a grand ?
huh ?
i need ...
i need 15, 000 .
fifteen ?
yep .
i need a blow job from christy turlington .
get the fuck outta here . $15, 000 ?
seriously , joey .
what can you do for me ?
five hundred dollars is not even gonna get me started .
goddamn it , mike , if 500 won' t help , what' s two grand gonna do ?
what kind of trouble you in ?
i' m in the worst kind , with the worst guy .
kgb ?
yep .
come here .
didn' t i tell you ... to never let that guy get a hold of you ?
you told me a lot of things .
yeah , yeah .
and you don' t listen .
i tell you to play within your means , you risk your whole bankroll .
i tell you not to overextend yourself , to rebuild , you go into hock for more .
i was giving you a living , mike , showing you the playbook i put together off my own beats .
that wasn' t enough for you ...
this is one time i don' t need you to tell me how i fucked up .
i know i fucked up .
what i need from you is money .
i need whatever money you can give me .
see , that' s the thing .
this time there is no money .
i give you two grand , what' s that buy you ?
a day ?
no , i give it to you , i' m wasting it .
that' s fucking great .
you did it to yourself .
you had to put it all on the line for some vegas pipe dream .
yeah , i took a risk .
i took a risk .
you see all the angles .
you never have the stones to play one .
stones " ?
you little punk .
i' m not playing for the thrill of fucking victory here .
i owe rent , alimony , child support .
i play for money .
my kids eat .
i got stones enough not to chase cards , action ... or fucking pipe dreams of winning the world series on espn .
you want me to , uh , call some people , try and buy you some time , i will .
place to stay , or the truck .
no problem .
but about the money , i gotta do this .
i gotta say no .
that' s fine .
i understand .
hey , listen .
what ?
i put it all on the line .
that' s true .
and you know what ?
it wasn' t a bad beat .
i wasn' t unlucky .
i got outplayed .
i got outplayed that time .
but i know i' m good enough to sit at that table .
it' s not ...
it' s not a fucking pipe dream .
i don' t doubt your talent .
i never ...
i never told anybody this .
about eight , nine months ago , i' m at the taj , it' s late , and i see johnny chan walk in .
and he goes , he sits 300 600 .
and the whole place stops when johnny chan walks in .
everybody puts an eye on him .
after a little while , there wasn' t a crap game going ...
' cause all the high rollers are over there watching him .
some are playing with him , giving away their money to this guy to say ...
oh , i played with the world champion .
and you know what i did ?
i sat down .
nah , you need 50 , 60 grand to play right in that game .
well , i had six , but i had to know .
what happened ?
played tight for an hour .
i folded mostly , and then i made a score .
wired aces or kings ?
rags .
i had nothing .
but he raised .
and i just decided , you know , i don' t care about the money .
i' m just gonna outplay the guy .
i' m just gonna outplay this guy this hand .
i re raised .
re raise .
you played right back at him , huh ?
oh , yeah .
and he just comes right back over the top of me , trying to bully me like i' m some fucking tourist .
i hesitate for two seconds .
i re raised .
and he makes a move toward his checks , and he looks at me .
and he looks at his cards , and he looks at me again .
and he mucked it .
i took it down .
did you have it ?
i' m sorry , john .
i don' t remember .
i got up , and i walked to the cashier .
i sat with the best in the world , and i won .
you put a fucking move on chan , you son of a bitch .
so that' s why you made that run on kgb' s place .
that' s right .
and i' il do it again if i can .
well , then i' m rooting for you , mike .
i' il see you around , knish .
this is temporary ?
will you be back next semester ?
oh , i think we both know i' m no lawyer .
i hope my story didn' t discourage you .
no .
it inspired me .
i think i was on my way out anyway .
but now you' re here .
that' s right .
you' re in trouble ?
yes , sir , i am .
uh , not with the law .
i owe .
a gambling debt ?
yeah .
it' s not mine .
it' s , uh ...
i vouched for the wrong guy .
um , so now it' s on me .
i understand .
so , what will it take for you to be free of this ?
i need 15, 000 tonight .
michael !
michael !
you know , i' m not a wealthy man , michael .
i know .
and it kills me to ask you , but ...
i don' t have any other play here .
so , uh , if you can help me at all ...
i hate to see you like this .
i want to help you , michael .
but $15, 000 , i ...
i ...
i know .
if it must be tonight , then ten is the best i can do .
would you do that ?
when my mother let me leave the yeshiva , it nearly broke her .
but she knew ...
she knew the life i had to lead .
to do that for another is a mitzvah .
and for that , i owe .
so you take this money ... and you get yourself out of this trouble .
you hear me ?
i know you can .
i ...
i promise that i' m gonna ...
i' il pay you back .
good luck .
i' ve often seen these people , these squares , at the table .
short stacked and long odds against , all their outs gone , one last card in the deck that can help them .
i used to wonder how they could let themselves get into such bad shape ... and how the hell they thought they could turn it around .
just walking in here makes me queasy .
the brick walls .
the fucking mopes at the tables .
the musty smell .
i feel like buckner walking back into shea .
but what choice do i have ?
so , you have my money ?
i owe you that money tomorrow , right ?
da .
so it' s still mine .
for the next eight hours , it is yours .
but if you don' t have it all by then , then you are mine .
well ...
i got $10, 000 .
i' m looking for a game .
you sure ?
you heard me .
so , we' il play .
heads up .
we both start with a couple of racks .
blinds , uh , 25 and 50 ?
and we don' t stop until one of us has it all .
let' s do it .
i' m gonna raise .
thousand straight .
very aggressive .
a new day .
and you won' t be pushed around .
but ...
i re raise .
five thousand .
doyle brunson says , " the key to no limit ... is to put a man to a decision for all his chips .
teddy' s just done it .
he' s representing aces , the only hand better than my cowboys .
i can' t call and give him a chance to catch .
i can only fold , if i believe him .
or ...
i re raise .
i' m all in .
take it down .
in a heads up match , the size of your stack is almost as important as the quality of your cards .
i chopped one of his legs out in the first hand .
now all i have to do is lean on him until he falls over .
check .
bet a thousand .
call .
i' il call .
check .
what' s that , 2, 500 there ?
i' m gonna tap your tap .
jacks up .
very good .
good hand .
catching that jack on the turn .
you got lucky there .
yep , it was luck .
so , that' s it then , hmm ?
just like a young man coming in for a quickie .
i feel so unsatisfied .
i' m sorry .
you must feel proud and good .
strong enough to beat the world .
i feel fine .
me too .
i feel okay .
' course maybe we check with one other guy , see how he feels .
grama !
i thought i smelled him .
i' il take what' s ours .
' course you could let it ride , mike .
take your chances .
you could let this happen , grama ?
sure , partner .
he still has till morning to make good .
uh , you know what ?
i got my five grand here .
that' s just fine by me .
i' m going home .
fine .
it' s a fucking joke anyway .
after all , i am paying you with your money .
what did you say ?
your money .
i am still up 20 grand ... from this last time i stick it in you .
they' re trying to goad me , trying to own me .
but this isn' t a gunfight .
it' s not about pride or ego .
it' s only about money .
i can leave now , even with grama and kgb ... and halfway to paying petrovsky back .
that' s the safe play .
i told worm you can' t lose what you don' t put in the middle .
deal ' em .
but you can' t win much either .
checks !
double the blinds ?
yeah .
table stakes .
good .
feel free to reload at any time .
you must be kicking yourself ... for not walking out when you could .
bad judgment .
but ... don' t you worry , son .
it will all be over soon .
okay .
check .
no check here .
i tap you .
i' m laying this down , teddy .
top two pair .
it' s a monster hand , and i' m gonna lay that down ...
' cause you got two four , and i' m not gonna draw against a made hand .
lays down a monster .
should have paid me off on that .
why the fuck did you lay that down ?
wow .
not hungry ?
mr. son of a bitch .
let' s play some cards .
you spot a man' s tell , you don' t say a fucking word .
i finally spotted kgb' s .
and usually i would' ve let him go on chewing those oreos till he was dead broke .
but i don' t have that kind of time .
i' ve only got till morning .
not even teddy kgb' s immune to getting a little rattled .
enough is enough , teddy .
finish the fucking kid off .
hanging around .
hanging around .
kid' s got alligator blood .
can' t get rid of him .
no , i' m not going anywhere .
double the blind .
okay .
i call .
check .
two grand .
all right , i' il call the two grand .
i' il gamble .
don' t splash the pot .
you' re on a draw , mike ?
go away .
this one is not good for you .
and in my club , i will splash the pot whenever the fuck i please .
okay .
i' m gonna check , teddy .
that' s right .
big daddy ... bets ... the pot .
that' s 4, 400 .
all right , i' m gonna call you , or else i won' t respect myself tomorrow morning .
respect is all you' il have left in the morning .
last card coming .
check .
it hurts , doesn' t it ?
you can' t believe what fell .
all your dreams ... dashed .
