oh , yes .
princess atta , the poor dear .
oh , wind' s died down .
they' il be here soon .
just be confident , dear .

right .
oh , it' il be fine .
it' s the same , year after year .
they come , they eat , they leave .
that' s our lot in life .
it' s not a lot , but it' s our life .

oh , you' re such a cute little aphid .
ditch dot !
yeah , yeah !
hey , come back here !
dot !

dot , you' re a young queen ant , and your wings are too little to be
i was talking to mother .
you' re not the queen yet , atta .
now , dot , be nice to your sister .
it' s not my fault she' s so stressed out .
i know , i know .
i' m always acting like the sky is falling .
look out !
atta !
princess atta !
princess atta !
princess atta !
oh !
hey !

what do you think you' re doing ?
you could have killed somebody over here .
i' m sorry !
i' m sorry !
oh , it' s flik .
oh
i' m sorry , i' m sorry , i' m sorry , i' m so sorry !
please forgive me .
i' m sorry !
princess atta !
flik , what are you doing ?
oh !
oh , this !
this is my new idea for harvesting grain .
no more picking individual kernels .
you can just cut down the entire stalk !
flik , we don' t have time for this .
exactly !
we never have time to collect food for ourselves .
because we spend all summer harvesting for the offering .
but my invention will speed up production .
oh , another invention ?
yeah , and i' ve got something for you too .
flik !
since you' re gonna be queen , you could use this to oversee production .
dr flora , if i may .
this is all very nice , but  what ?
just an ordinary blade of grass and a bead of dew , right ?
flik , please .
wrong !
it is , in fact , a telescope .
it' s very clever , flik , but  hello , princess !
my , aren' t you looking lovely this morning !
not , of course , that you would need a telescope to see that .
all right , listen !
the princess doesn' t have time for this !
you wanna help us fill this thing ?
then get rid of that machine ... get back in line and pick grain like everybody else !
like everybody else !
please , flik .
just go .
i' m sorry , i i was i was really just trying trying to help .
harvester .
why , we harvested the same way ever since i was a pupa .
where were we ?
the food pile , your highness .
oh , yes , yes .
hey , flik !
flik !
wait up !
oh .
hello , princess .
you can call me dot .
here , you forgot this .
thanks .
you can keep it .
i can make another one .
i like your inventions .
really ?
well , you' re the first .
i' m beginning to think nothing i do works .
this works .
great .
one success .
i' m never gonna make a difference .
me , neither .
i' m a royal ant , and i can' t even fly yet .
i' m too little .
oh , being little' s not such a bad thing .
yes , it is .
no , it' s not .
is too !
is not .
is too .
is not .
is too .
is not .
is not .
is not .
oh !
is too .
is too .
is too .
a seed .
i need i need a seed .
ahh
ohh !
ah , here , here .
pretend pretend that that' s a seed .
it' s a rock .
oh , i know it' s a rock .
i know .
but let' s just pretend for a minute that it' s a seed , all right ?
we' il just use our imaginations .
now now , do you see our tree ?
everything that made that giant tree ... is already contained inside this tiny little seed .
all it needs is some time , a little bit of sunshine and rain , and ... voil !
this rock will be a tree ?
seed to tree .
you' ve gotta work with me , all right ?
okay .
you might not feel like you can do much now ... but that' s just because , well , you' re not a tree yet .
you just have to give yourself some time .
you' re still a seed .
but it' s a rock .
i know it' s a rock !
don' t ya think i know a rock when i see a rock ?
i' ve spent a lot of time around rocks !
you' re weird , but i like you .
they' re here .
they' re here !
mom !
where are you ?
they' re coming !
run !
dot !
dot !
mom !
single file !
mom !
thank heavens !
food to the offering stone .
okay , everyone , single file .
food to the offering stone and into the anthill .
now let' s go !
go , go , go , go !
come on .
keep movin ' , keep movin ' !
good .
okay .
that' s everyone .
hey !
hey , wait for me !
get the food to the offering stone , then into the anthill .
no !
no , no , no , no , no !
oh , oh !
oh , no .
princess atta !
princess atta !
princess atta !
they come , they eat , they leave .
they come , they eat , they leave .
excuse me , pardon me .
pardon me , excuse me .
coming through .
excuse me .
excuse me .
sorry , sorry .
coming through .
princess atta , there' s something i need to tell you .
not now , flik .
but , your highness , it' s about the offering !
hey , what' s goin ' on ?
yeah , where' s the food ?
what did you do ?
it was an accident ?
boo !
where' s the food ?
huh ?
hopper .
so , where is it ?
where' s my food ?
i i isn' t it up there ?
what ?
the food was in a leaf sitting on top  excuse me .
are you sure it' s not up there ?
are you saying i' m stupid ?
no .
do i look stupid to you ?
let' s just think about the logic , shall we ?
let' s just think about it for a second .
if it was up there , would i be coming down here ... to your level , looking for it ?
uh , i  why am i even talking to you ?
you' re not the queen .
you don' t smell like the queen .
sh she' s learning to take over for me , hopper .
oh , i see .
under new management .
so it' s your fault .
no , it wasn' t me .
it was
uh uh uh .
everything is your fault .
but but i  it' s a bug eat bug world out there , princess ... one of those circle of life kind of things .
now , let me tell you how things are supposed to work .
the sun grows the food .
the ants pick the food .
the grasshoppers eat the food  and the birds eat the grasshoppers .
hey , like the one that nearly ate you , you remember ?
you remember ?
oh , you should' ve seen it .
molt .
this blue jay he has him halfway down his throat , okay ?
and hopper hopper' s kickin ' and screamin ' , okay ?
and i' m scared , okay ?
i' m not goin ' anywhere near , okay ?
aw , come on .
it' s a great story .
ow , ow , ow , ow , ow , ow .
i swear , if i hadn' t promised mother on her deathbed ... that i wouldn' t kill you , i would kill you .
and believe me , no one appreciates that more than i do .
shut up !
i don' t want to hear another word out of you while we' re on this island .
do you understand me ?
i said , do you understand me ?
well , how can i answer ?
you said i couldn' t say another word .
remember ma !
hey , i' m a compassionate insect .
there' s still a few months till the rains come ... so you can all just try again .
but , hopper , since it' s almost the rainy season ... we need this time to gather food for ourselves .
listen , if you don' t keep your end of the bargain , then i can' t guarantee your safety .
and there are insects out there that will take advantage of you .
someone could get hurt .
what' s the matter ?
you scared of grasshoppers ?
dot !
you don' t like thumper ?
leave her alone !
you want her ?
go ahead .
take her .
no ?
then get back in line .
it seems to me that you ants are forgetting your place .
so let' s double the order of food .
huh ?
no !
but but but
we' il be back at the end of the season ... when the last leaf falls .
you ants have a nice summer .
let' s ride !
flik , what do you have to say for yourself ?
sorry .
i i' m sorry for the way i am .
i didn' t mean for things to go so wrong .
i especially didn' t want to make you look bad , princess .
well , flik , ya did .
i was just trying to help .
then help us don' t help us .
help ?
help ?
help ?
flik , you are sentenced to one month digging in the tunnels .
excuse me , your highness .
need i remind you of flik' s tunnel within a tunnel project ?
helpers to help us .
that could that' s it !
that' s we could  it took the whole engineering department ... two days to dig him out .
send him to health and ant services .
heavens , no !
we could leave the island .
the river bed' s dry right now .
we' d just walk right across the river bed .
we could go get helpers .
we could !
we could leave .
sure .
we could go find helpers to help us .
it' s perfect !
perfect ?
what' s so perfect ?
your highness , don' t you see ?
we could send someone to get help !
leave the island ?
now , why didn' t i think of that ?
oh !
because it' s suicide !
she' s right !
we never leave the island .
never leave !
there' s snakes and birds and bigger bugs out there !
exactly !
bigger bugs !
we could find bigger bugs to come here and fight ... and forever rid us of hopper and his gang !
ludicrous !
who would do a crazy thing like that ?
i' il volunteer .
i' d be very happy to volunteer .
you got a lot of spunk , kid , but no one' s gonna help a bunch of ants .
at least we could try .
oh , i i could i could travel to the city !
i could search there !
if you went , you' d be on that silly search for weeks .
royal huddle .
great idea , princess .
it' s perfect .
exactly .
wait a minute .
what did we just decide here ?
to let flik leave .
while we keep harvesting to meet hopper' s demands .
you see , with flik gone , he can' t  he can' t mess anything up !
flik , after much deliberation , we have decided to grant you your request .
really ?
really ?
uh , really .
oh , thank you , princess .
thank you so much for this chance .
i i i won' t let you down , i promise , i promise , i promise .
yeah , that' s fine .
that' s fine .
no , forget it .
forget it .
oh , but i should probably help repair the damage before i go , don' t you think ?
no !
no , no !
just go .
just go .
just leave !
hey .
don' t worry !
the colony is in good hands !
bye , now .
all right .
hey , fellas .
beautiful mornin ' , huh ?
my dad says he gives you 1 hour before you come back to the island crying .
does he , now ?
my dad doesn' t think that .
he doesn' t , huh ?
naw , he' s bettin ' you' re gonna die .
oh .
yeah , he says if the heat doesn' t get ya , the birds will .
well , i think he' s gonna make it .
nobody asked you , your royal shortness .
yeah , dot .
what do you know ?
hey , hey , hey .
ease up , all right ?
come on .
she' s entitled to her opinion too .
ohh .
so go , already .
hey !
the city' s that way .
i know .
you' re supposed to look for bugs , not dandelions .
you leave him alone .
he knows what he' s doing .

you' re too kind .
thank you .
you don' t think i' ve offended the warriors , do you ?
you ?

oh , good .
because , you see ... when you first brought them here , i thought you' d hired a bunch of clowns .
ya did ?
don' t tell ' em i said that .
boy , that' s all i' d need , another royal blunder like that .
princess , you' re doin ' a great job .
thanks .
you' re sweet .
you' re wrong but sweet .
i know what everyone really thinks .
i don' t follow you .
everyone the whole colony .
nobody really believes i can do this job .
it' s like they' re all watching me ...
just , just  waiting for you to screw up .
flik , i owe you an apology .
for what ?
well , i haven' t been that nice to you , and i' m sorry .
if there' s any way i can make it up to you hey !
i know !
how would you like to be the queen' s official aide to the warrior bugs ?
me ?
oh , sure .
you' ve got a great rapport going with them ... especially after that rescue it was very brave .
really ?
naw , naw  well , not every bug would face a bird .
i mean , even hopper' s afraid of ' em .
yeah , well , i guess maybe i have
say that again ?
i said , even hopper' s afraid of birds .
thank you .
hopper' s afraid of birds !
and i don' t blame ' im !
oh , oh , oh , this is perfect .
we can get rid of hopper , and no one has to know that i messed up .
you just keep pretending you' re warriors .
whoa , flik , honey .
we are not about to fight grasshoppers , okay ?
you' il be gone before the grasshoppers ever arrive .
it' il be easy .
here' s what we do .
not another word .
i don' t know what you' re concocting in that little ant brain of yours ... but we' il have no part of it .
excuse me ?
could we get the warriors ' autographs ?
autographs ?
oh , wow !
great !
so , you fellas catch the action today ?
oh !
the bird went and it just missed you !
oh , aren' t you sweet ?
and the way you pretended to be stuck in that huge crack !
oh , that' s just all part of the plan .
yeah , yeah .
and then you dive bombed into the bush !
there you go , my boy .

i' m gonna be a stick bug !
oh , they' re all so cool , i can' t pick !
delightful lads .
you were saying , flik ?
all right .
we are going to build a bird a bird that we can operate from the inside , which would then be hoisted above our anthill
hoisted above the anthill and hidden high in the tree .
then , right when hopper and his gang are below ... we' il launch the bird and scare off the grasshoppers .
now it' s going to take
everyone' s involvement to make this plan a reality .
i know it' s not our tradition to do things differently ... but if our ancestors were able to build this anthill ... we can certainly rally together to build this bird !
perfect !
okay , hit your marks !
whoa !
whee hee !
hi , flik .

you know somethin ' ?
you' re makin ' a lot of sense .
i mean , why take the risk ?
you should tell hopper .

and it was mine .
why go back to ant lsland at all ?
i mean , you don' t even like grain .
what ?
you' re right .
i didn' t think it was such a good idea myself .
actually , it wasn' t even my idea .
it was axle and loco' s !
they talked fancy to me .
i got confused !
da da da da da da da
guys , order another round ... because we' re stayin ' here !
yeah !
yeah !
what was i thinking ?
going back to ant lsland .
i mean , we just got here , and we have more than enough food to get us through the winter .
right ?
why go back ?
but there was that ant that stood up to me .
yeah , but we can forget about him !
yeah , it was just one ant .
one ant !
yeah , you' re right !
it' s just one ant !
yeah , boss .
they' re puny !
hmm , puny .
say , let' s pretend this grain is a puny little ant .
did that hurt ?
nope .
well , how ' bout this one ?
are you kiddin ' ?
well , how ' bout this ?
you let one ant stand up to us ... then they all might stand up .
those puny little ants outnumber us 100 to one .
and if they ever figure that out , there goes our way of life !
it' s not about food .
it' s about keeping those ants in line .
that' s why we' re going back !

ah , guys , i' ve been lookin ' all over for ya !
flaming death is a huge hit !
p. t. !

word of mouth got around .

the next day , there was a line of flies outside the tent went on forever !
it must have been a foot long !

so , i figured it out .
you guys burn me twice a night , i take a day off to heal .
and then we do it all over again !
we' il be the top circus act in the business !
you mean , you' re not warriors ?
are you kiddin ' ?
these guys are the lousiest circus bugs you' ve ever seen .
and they' re gonna make me rich !
you mean to tell me that our entire defensive strategy ... was concocted by clowns ?
hey , hey , hey , hey .
we really thought flik' s idea was gonna work .
oops .
tell me this isn' t true .
no , you don' t you don' t  this couldn' t have happened at a more inopportune time !
the last leaf is about to fall !
we haven' t collected any food for the grasshoppers !
if hopper finds out what we almost did
hopper is not going to find out .
we' re going to hide all this and pretend it never happened .
you bugs were never here .
so i suggest you all leave .
but the bird !
the the the bird will work .
i never thought i' d see the day when an ant would put himself ...
before the rest of his colony .

the point is , flik , you lied to us .
no , no , no !
i i just
you lied , flik .
you lied to her .
you lied to the colony !
you lied to me !
and like an idiot , i believed you .

i just wanted to make a difference .
i want you to leave , flik .
and this time , don' t come back .
tough crowd .
yee haw !
flik !
that' s it ?
but there' s got to be more food on the island !

where' s dot ?
has anyone seen dot ?
whose idea was this ?
huh ?
was it yours , princess ?
just get behind me , girls .
it' il be okay .
leave her alone , hopper .
the bird was my idea .
i' m the one you want .
where do you get the gall to do this to me ?
you were you were gonna squish the queen .
it' s true .
i hate it when someone gives away the ending .
you piece of dirt !
no , i' m wrong .
you' re lower than dirt .
you' re an ant !
let this be a lesson to all you ants .
ideas are very dangerous things .
you are mindless , soil shoving losers ... put on this earth to serve us !
you' re wrong , hopper .
ants are not meant to serve grasshoppers !
i' ve seen these ants do great things .
and year after year , they somehow manage ... to pick food for themselves and you .
so so who is the weaker species ?
ants don' t serve grasshoppers .
it' s you who need us .
we' re a lot stronger than you say we are .
and you know it , don' t you ?
well , princess !
um , hopper ?
um , i i hate to interrupt , but , um
you ants stay back !
oh , this was such a bad idea !
you see , hopper ... nature has a certain order .
the ants pick the food , the ants keep the food ... and the grasshoppers leave !
i' m so proud of you , flik !
charge a !
where are you going ?
they' re just ants !
no !
bad grasshopper !
bad grasshopper !
go home !
yeah !
come back here , you cowards !
don' t leave !
to the cannon !
to the cannon !
no !
happy landings , hopper !
huh ?
rain !
flik !
quick !
after them !
slim !
francis !
francis !
francis , i' m stuck !
where are ya ?
i' m over here !
where ?
here !
i' m the only stick with eyeballs !
help !
help !
help !
get him !
no !
go that way !
but the anthill' s over  i' ve got an idea !
flik !
come on !
there !
come on !
we' ve gotta hide !
no matter what happens , stay down !
flik , no !
what are you doing ?
hopper !
you think it' s over ?
no , no , no .
no , i i can explain .
all your little stunt did was buy them time !
no , please !
please , hopper !
i' il get more grasshoppers and be back next season ... but you won' t !
well , what' s this ?
another one of your little bird tricks ?
yup .
are there a bunch of little girls in this one , too ?
hello , girls !
no !
no !
no , no , no , no !
no !
no !
oh , no !
oh , no !
no , no , no !
come on , boys !

when the time came he knew
what to do
he knew in order to succeed they' d have to work together
