it totally turned me around .
really ?
yeah , the people there are cool , you know .
they don' t worry about material things .
not like here , where traveling' s about what kind of car you drive .
it should be about broadening the mind .
that' s fine , as long as you' ve got somebody to do the driving .
i can never wait to get home .
to your husband ?
she' s divorced .
that' s too bad .
not necessarily .
so what do your folks say about you going to all these places ?

i picked up this really amazing cd out there .
you wanna hear it ?
yeah , sure .
fuck me .
so , do you see him ?
your dad ?

sometimes .
what about yours ?
your family ?
we parted ways a long time ago .
you know what they say , you can choose your friends , but yu can' t choose your family .
who says ?
sometimes family chooses you .
you can just drop me off at this picnic area coming up on the right .
here .
a very wise person gave that to me once .
he said " nobody in chains soared up to the sun " .

don' t worry .
she never gets lost .
hello ?
oh my god , you' re kidding ?

we just passed some picnic area with a grizzly bear statue beside the road .
are you sure ?
okay , we' il do that .
thanks .
bye .
anything to report ?
yeah , i forgot my birthday present .
but dad said he can bring it to the next rest stop .
you' re kidding ?
call him up and tell him to send it in the mail .
don' t be a drag , he said he could meet us in thirty minutes .
after offering a ride to ms barefoot bombay ?
i don' t wanna stop again .
thank you .
so what did your dad get you , anyway ?
i don' t know why you' re asking .
it' s not like you' re interested .
who are all these people ?
what are they all doing here ?
what are we doing here ?
it' s natural to be afraid of failure .
but it doesn' t have to limit us .
or keep us from realizing our own potential .
from creating opportunities for success in the boardroom ... ... on the playing fields and in the bedroom .
we are bombarded with answers , but are we asking the right questions ?
now , i want you to do something for me .
close your eyes .
go on ... ... just for a minute .
close your eyes .
i want you to visualize ... ... a door .
now ... ... reach into your pocket ... ... where there is a key .
feel it ?
that key in your pocket ... ... unlocks the door .
only you can open the door .
behind the door is the truth .
go on ... ... unlock the door .
look inside .
face the truth ... ... senga .
hi , dad .
yeah , okay , i' il see you outside .
stay here .
i' il be back in a minute .
senga , thanks for waiting .
which time ?
let' s see it then .
come on , show me the present .
well , this is great .
not only do you lie to me , but you go straight to your father and sweet talk him .
i didn' t lie .
he asked me what i wanted .
hold on , i didn' t realize that you two already talked about this .
if you had , do you think she' s old enough to go off on her own for a whole weekend in the wilderness ?
she' s not a kid any more .
she' s not exactly an adult either .
if you spent more time with her , you' d understand that .
if you wanna go with her , i don' t have a problem in the world with this .
it' s not about you and me any more .
if you want to make a scene , do it without me , okay ?
this is something you two have to sort out .
god , how familiar this sounds !
dad , we talked about this .
tell her what you think .
i' il call you , sweetheart , okay ?
see you .
we' il do something special .
dad !
i' m going and you can' t stop me !
you want a bet ?
dad !
get used to it , nat .
bailing out is the only thing your father knows how to do well .
i' m not fucking surprised , with you !
why is it only your way is right and nobody else has a say in the matter ?
no wonder you screwed up your marriage .
stop it .
you' re afraid i might get pregnant young and screw up my life like you did ?
well i' m not that stupid .
get in the car .
no .
nat , get in the car now !
no .
fuck you .
i hate you .
nat ?

nat ?
nat ?
i don' t like talking about my past life ... ... because it hurts me .
really , do we have to talk about this ?
and your father ?
i don' t even know who my dad was .
not that my mother even knew his last name .
and my mother died ...
chrlstlne
my parents ... they were nice .
but , there were fucking boring .
i mean , really fucking boring , okay .
and my brother , we were close .
we got along but we seemed , like , totally different , i mean ... ... he' s a mechanic , and he' s gonna be that his whole life .

vehicle remains upright , unknown if persons inside .
relax .
you get any stiffer , rigor mortis will set in .
come on , nat , relax .
i know how you feel .
i had to go through it myself .
you see , nat , there' s this whole community of people ... ... just like us .
you know , it' s like an extended family .
only better .
it seems like ever since i met the father ... ... my old life feels like it belongs to someone else .
he makes us feel special , like ... ... we finally fit in or belong to something bigger than ourselves .
he' s the reason we' re all here together .
no time for criticizing
music hypnotizing
everybody' s temperature' s rising
so get back
how do you feel ?
i feel ... ... different .
do you wanna look different ?
yeah .
then come on .
you all right ?
i just ran my car off the road .

there are a lot of maniacs out here .
you' re alive ... ... that' s the main thing .
look , could you just ... ... please get my car on the road ?
why don' t you come with me ?
it' s not safe out on the freeway .

that' s my sister .
what' s her name ?
christine .
she' s dead .
do you wanna use my phone ?
call your husband ?
no .
maybe he' s worried about you .
i said no .
i' m gonna make the next stop .
and there you can report your accident to the police .
they can help you find your daughter .
it' s the bradford district .
right .
thanks a lot .
right .
there' s no record of a reported abduction .
in fact , there' s nothing matching your daughter' s description .
of course not , she' s not a real police officer .
do you have a photograph of your daughter ?
no , that woman took it .
i told you .
but i saw a picture of another girl in the pick up truck ... ... and then i saw a cassette of the very same girl ...
what has this got to d with your daughter ?
if you stop and think about it for a minute ... you' d see that they' re all in it together .
the recovery man , the backpacker , the couple with the rv !
we have no record of an officer responding .
no radio broadcasting , no ...
why aren' t you calling the fbi right now and reporting my daughter missing ?
these people are deranged !
is that what they are ?
deranged ?
that' s her father .
my ex husband .
that' s his cell phone .
call him .
sorry to trouble you .
detective stephens here , from bradford police division .
i' m sitting here with a woman ,
senga wilson , she says she' s your ex wife .
look , detective , before you go any further ... ... there' s something you need to know about my ex wife .
this isn' t exactly the first time i' ve gotten a call like this from the police .
especially at this hour .
she' s been on medication since the divorce .
she' s delusional .
i understand you have a fifteen year old daughter , natasha , is that correct ?
yes , my daughter' s here with me now .
she' s been with me all weekend .
okay .
i' m afraid senga' s wasting everyone' s time .
i' m sorry i can' t be of more help , detective .
thank you for your time , mr. wilson .
your husband has just told me that your daughter is safe at home with him .
mrs. wilson ?
you know , you' re obviously very upset ... ... but filing a fraudulent police report is a crime .
you do realize that ?
now , look ... ... if you' re in a domestic situation ... ... that' s okay .
talk to one of our female officers .
god damn it .
come on .
hi , you' ve reached lois and marek .

i remember what you remember .
but it doesn' t have to limit us .
or keep us from realizing our own potential .
from creating the opportunities for success in the boardroom ... ... on the playing fields and in the bedroom .

he' s got this amazing power to ... ... work out all the fucked up shit in your life .
yeah ... ... don' t get me wrong , i still got a soft spot for jacking cars .
he' s gonna love you .
he' s ready .
wait , wait , i don' t know , i mean , what' s gonna happen ?

you don' t have to go with her .
you don' t have to do anything you don' t want to .
you' re free now .
nat , where are you ?
say something .
nobody' s gonna hurt you , nat .
she' s just terrified of letting you go .
having your own life ... ... your own dreams ...
she just wants to take you away from the ones who understand you .
don' t listen to him , nat .
you always knew she was crazy , didn' t you ?
unhinged . illogical .
a fantastic ... liar .
we wanna give you a real family .
with no lies ... no pills ... ... no restrictions ... ... no screaming matches ... ... just ... love .
that' s bullshit , nat .
i' m here .
i can see you .
they wanna kill you !
funny you should mention that .
isn' t that exactly what you tried to do ?
she tried to kill you .
did you know that ?
no .
before you were even born .
she wanted an abortion , nat .
tried to flush you away .
sorry .
i' m sorry .
i remember what you remember .
you gotta hang on .
because the truth is with us in the house tonight .
close your eyes .

hold that key .
you don' t have to fight any more .
it' s over .
come on .
come into the light .
nat ... ... " m sorry you had to see it .
but i had to show you through the hypocrisy and the lies .
pain is all in the past , not in the future .
all you have to do is meet me halfway .
where' s my daughter ?
i want my daughter back .
what have you done with my daughter ?
listen .
you' ve got to trust me .
nat was the only way i could find them .
there' s something you should see first .
they kill people by knocking them off the road .
your husband didn' t even get five miles past the rest stop .
come on , nat , don' t lose your faith .
join us .
what did you do with her ?
nat ?
you just don' t get it , do you ?
this man is not who he says he is .
don' t listen to them .
they' re full of lies .
i' m calling marek .
he killed your father .
wait , nat .
hey , senga .
see you on the other side .
you stole my sister .
she was my sister too .
hey , senga ... ... " m only here to fill the void .
the void you created ... ... by not listening to who nat really is .
get him out of your head .
this is how he works .
he' s got them so fucked up they' re killing people for blood .
i was too late for christine .
i had to kill her to stop her from killing anybody else .
you' re lucky you' re alive .
why can' t you just leave me alone ?
i' m your mother .
i don' t always get things right .
but please , nat , you have to trust me now .
let' s get out of here .
let' s go .
in here .
now !
come on , nat .
wait .
you killed christine ... ... now i' m gonna kill you .
she was already dead when i found her .
not dead ... free .
the day you tried to murder your daughter is the day you let me in .
truth is in the house tonight ... ... senga .
