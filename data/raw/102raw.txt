ithoughtyou' d be taller .
so , vincent ...
what are the two names ?
ramone ayala and clarke .
ramone ayala and clarke were murdered tonight ?
both killed ?
clarke for sure .
ramone , i don' t know .
i got another d. o. a.
daniel baker out of south central , leimert park .
that' s three .
three what ?
witnesses .
vincent meets their people in culiacan or cartagena .
but he don' t meet you .
ok .
now you' re here .
why ?
i lost my stuff .
the list .
i want you to listen to me real well .
special groups put together the list of dedos .
dedos .
fingers .
informants .
signal interceptions with voice recognition software , surveillance .
a very expensive counterintelligence worked up that list .
an important list .
wouldn' t you say ?
and you lost it ?
yeah .
i' m sorry .
sorry .
sorry ?
sorry " does not put humpty dumpty back together again .
do you believe in humpty dumpty ?
no .
do you believe in santa claus ?
no .
nor do l .
nor do i , but my children do .
they are still small .
but do you know who they like even better than santa claus ?
his helper .
pedro el negro .
black peter .
there' s an old mexican tale that tells of how santa claus got so busy looking out for the good children , that he had to hire some help to look out for the bad children .
so he hired pedro .
and santa claus gave him a list with all the names of all the bad children .
and pedro would come every night to check them out .
and the people , the little kids that were misbehaving , that were not saying their prayers ,
pedro would leave a little toy donkey on their windows .
a little burro , and he would come back .
if they were still misbehaving , pedro would take them away and nobody would ever see them again .
now , if i am being santa claus , and you are pedro , how do you think jolly old santa claus would feel if one day pedro came into his office and said , " i lost the list " ?
how fucking furious do you think he will get ?
tell me , vincent .
tell me what you think .
what ?
i think ...
i think you should tell the guy ... behind me ... ... to put that gun down .
what did you say ?
i said you should tell the guy behind me to put his gun away before i take it and beat his bitch ass to death with it .
i picked up a tail .
federal ?
i don' t know , you tell me .
that' s why i tossed the list .
the work ups , all of that shit .
to protect , in part ... your hermes faonnable ass .
you think i like coming in here ?
but , hey ... ... shit happens .
got to roll with it .
adapt .
