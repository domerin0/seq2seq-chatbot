i thought i might find work here .
well , it' s very difficult to obtain a work permit in isthmus .
it' s ...
well , one has to show a special talent that people here don' t have .
well , that shouldn' t be too difficult .
senor bond , you' ve got big cojones .
you come here , to my place , without references , ... .. carrying a piece , throwing around a lot of money .
but you should know something .
nobody saw you come in , ... .. so nobody has to see you go out .
senor sanchez , i could be very useful to a man in your position .
and i understand you have a reputation for rewarding loyalty very well .
i' il keep this for a few days .
we' il talk again .
and you won' t need a gun in isthmus .
it' s a very safe city .
in the meantime , i welcome you to the casino at all times .
check him out .
so what did you find out ?
there' s two inches of armoured glass .
i' d need a cannon to get to him .
ah , senor bond .
you will be pleased to know your uncle has arrived .
i put him in your suite .
thank you .
good night .
your uncle ?
let' s make this a proper family reunion .
give me your gun .
stay here .
really , 007 !
q !
what the hell are you doing here ? !
i might have killed you !
well , i' m on leave .
thought i' d pop round and see how you were getting on .
are you all right ?
of course .
how' d you find me ?
moneypenny .
she' s worried about you .
this is no place for you , q. go home .
don' t be an idiot , 007 .
i know exactly what you' re up to , and you' re gonna need my help .
remember , if it hadn' t been for q branch , you' d have been dead long ago .
everything for a man on holiday .
explosive alarm clock , guaranteed never to wake up anybody who uses it .
dentonite toothpaste .
to be used sparingly .
it' s the latest in plastic explosive .
i could do with some plastic .
i thought there might be a mess to clean up .
pam , this is q , my uncle .
uncle , this is miss kennedy , my cousin .
ah !
we must be related !
how do you do ?
now , pay attention , 007 .
now , this looks like an ordinary camera , doesn' t it ?
what kind of film does it take ?
1 20 ? . 220 high velocity .
now , this is a signature gun , and that is an optical palm reader .
and if i plug this into the bottom like that , ... .. once i' ve programmed it ...
now , nobody can use the gun but you .
smile , boys .
don' t use the flash !
stop fiddling with things you don' t understand .
you might have killed him .
that' s odd .
look , let' s all get some rest .
we' ve got a long , hard day ahead of us tomorrow .
good night , q.
sweet dreams , mr bond .
i hope you don' t snore , q.
you all know truman lodge .
and this is my head of security colonel heller .
kombanwa .
this is an historic moment .
east meets west .
drug dealers of the world unite .
extra bonus .
your job' s done .
take q and fly out of here now .
i' il make my own way back .
i' d like to stay .
no .
i work better alone .
piso tres .
in this business , there' s a lot of cash .
and a lot of people with their hands out .
in a word : bribery .
exactly .
he took the words right out of my pocket .
so you pay .
everyone and his brother is on the payroll .
so you buy a mayor , a chief of police , a general ...
a president .
one day you wake up and you own the whole goddamn country .
then you take what you want .
a bank , a gambling casino , airline concession .
why ?
simple .
it' s easier for the politicians to take silver than lead .
we have an invisible empire from chile to alaska .
what i want to do , amigos , is to make you part of it .
i want the pacific to be our little puddle .
what you have before you is a demographic report , ... .. breaking down each of your territories by age and socioeconomic group .
now , as you can clearly see , there is a huge potential demand , ... .. given the implementation of aggressive marketing .
as in the united states , ... .. senor sanchez is prepared to offer each of you exclusive franchises .
the price is 100 million per territory .
i believe you' il find that works out to , uh , 20 million per metric ton , mr tan .
we guarantee quality and price for five years .
senor sanchez , since arriving , we' ve eaten well , heard many good stories , ... .. but before i pay anything , i want to see some hardware .
mr kwang , you don' t pay for , uh ... hardware .
you pay for my personal guarantee and protection .
surely if you were to invest 100 million , you would want some reassurance .
you' re right .
why not ?
tomorrow i' il take you to our main distribution centre .
here you are .
goodbye , q. thanks for all you' ve done .
what ? !
you' re a hell of a field operative .
now go .
i' il see you back in london .
no more business .
time to have some fun .
gentlemen , enjoy yourselves .
this kwang ... seems like trouble .
why show them the labs ?
don' t worry .
he won' t expose the operation , huh ?
his excellency , el presidente lopez .
hector .
pasa .
there' s been a mistake with my cheque .
look at it .
it' s half the usual amount .
you were very quiet ... when i was arrested .
remember , you' re only president ... for life .
watch the birdie , you bastard !
aagh !
take his arm .
who would have a signature gun ?
james bond .
this is her majesty' s government' s .
how did you get it ?
piss off !
who ordered you to kill sanchez ?
no one .
he' s a rogue agent .
my orders are to take him back one way or the other .
we' re hong kong narcotics , you bastard !
sanchez is taking us to the heart of his operations .
i' ve been setting it up for years !
i just hope that little stunt of yours hasn' t scared him off !
get me out of these bloody things .
no , commander .
you' re a loose cannon on deck .
i' m shipping you straight back to london .
leave him !
no !
come on !
don' t let them take you alive .
he' s still alive .
who was it ?
who sent you ?
cyanide .
hey , amigo !
how do you feel ?
i' il survive .
lupe .
please .
the wavekrest is arriving tonight .
krest is coming here .
no , i' il call you back .
pedro , bring us some coffee .
good .
baby .
please .
well ... we both had close calls last night .
you were just in time .
things were about to turn nasty .
who were they ?
freelance hit team .
what did they want with you ?
one of them must have recognised me in the casino .
they were afraid i' d warn you , spoil their plans .
so you knew them ?
i used to work for the british government .
we kept dossiers on such people .
british agent .
caf , senor .
i knew it .
gracias .
you have class .
those men ... tried to kill me .
who would do such a thing ?
someone close to you .
cream ?
sugar ?
no .
did they tell you this ?
they were well briefed .
obviously by someone on the inside .
did they mention a name ?
no .
they were expecting to be paid a lot of cash ... .. by someone arriving in isthmus tonight .
you suspect someone ?
everyone in my organisation is 100 per cent loyal .
then you have nothing to worry about .
well , i have to go meet some people .
you rest here .
i have to go back to my hotel .
no , don' t go to the hotel .
save your money , huh ?
i insist .
stay here .
enjoy my hospitality .
lupe , show him the easy way up , please .
you are not gonna believe who this guy is .
former british agent .
how did you know that ?
because i know things .
i want to meet krest' s boat tonight .
we' il need a dozen reliable men .
is there a problem with krest ?
we' il see .
and bring lupe .
she was there .
he' s not gonna lie in front of her .
s , senor .
what are you doing ?
i' ve had my fill of sanchez ' hospitality .
he said to stay .
you' re asking for trouble .
there' s no need for you to get involved .
just give me five minutes , then scream .
james , listen to me .
there' s guards all over the place .
you' il never make it .
buenos das .
perdn .
gracias .
i' m going shopping !
i won' t be long !
please don' t !
not now !
senor sanchez said !
i haven' t had one of these in five years .
don' t worry .
007 always comes back .
james !
i thought i told you to leave , q.
we couldn' t go without knowing what had happened to you .
get your bags packed , q.
what the hell is the matter with you ?
just a couple of things .
kwang and his team of british agents are dead .
sanchez is alive .
i saw you in heller' s office .
you' re working with them .
no !
i want the truth .
i am telling the truth .
sanchez has arranged to buy four stinger missiles from the contras .
he' il shoot down an american airliner if the dea doesn' t lay off .
what about you and heller ?
felix gave me a letter at his wedding , ... .. granting heller immunity if he gets the stingers back .
did he go for the deal ?
yes .
and then you missed sanchez , and heller panicked and he said the deal was off , ... .. and that i was dead if he ever saw me again .
there' s more to this than your personal vendetta .
it' s a mess .
sanchez has tripled his security .
you' il never get another shot at him .
we don' t have to .
meet me at the harbour master' s office in two hours .
q , bring the rolls to the front .
yes , sir !
ah !
senor bond !
senor montelongo , i' m making a withdrawal .
pilot coming aboard , sir !
well ?
take me to the bridge !
gracias , captain .
i' il take over now .
you ?
you' re the harbour pilot ?
no , i' m his secretary
all yours , sir ...
ma' am .
aren' t you going in a bit too fast ?
you wanna do the driving ?
you take the wheel .
full speed astern !
what the hell are you doing ? !
harbour pilot went crazy .
i' d stick to flying if i were you .
i got the job done .
franz !
what a surprise !
i didn' t think you' d be here .
yeah .
i like surprises .
you seem to be having a lot of problems lately .
well , we had this crazy harbour pilot .
let' s talk about the money you owe me .
let' s talk inside .
does he have a safe ?
not up here .
maybe below .
have a look around .
check the bow and give me a damage report !
do i have this right ?
he water skied behind the plane , jumps on it ...
no , no .
he was , uh ...
well , yeah .
he threw the pilots out and flew away .
like a little bird .
the knife !
pedro .
would i make up a story like that ?
you must have seen something .
where' s 007 ?
he' s coming .
that' s not my money .
i swear !
that' s right , amigo .
it' s mine .
you think i' m stupid ?
huh ?
you rip me off , then use my own money to pay someone to kill me ? !
you want it so bad ?
then take it !
what are you doin ' ?
wait !
let me talk !
this is not my money !
no !
what the ...
aagh !
that hurts !
please !
what are you doing ?
aagh !
sanchez !
please , franz !
no !
what about the money , patrn ?
launder it .
this is where you leave .
take the plane .
i' il see you both in miami .
aren' t you coming ?
no .
they' il be after me .
it' il be safer on my own .
come on , my dear .
see you later .
what' s that ?
bond' s clothes .
they' re clean .
sorry to wake you , hermano .
i thought you' d like to know the information you gave me paid off .
i got the guy who set me up .
only one guy ?
what do you mean ?
i just thought that , um ... .. no one' d be stupid enough to try to take you on on their own .
i want you to come with me tomorrow .
where are we going ?
it' s a surprise .
you' re gonna like it .
james , what are you doing back here ?
your being here' s not a good idea , lupe .
it' s all right .
franz is having dinner with the chinese .
where' s he taking me tomorrow ?
he' s showing them a special place .
i don' t know where .
james , don' t go .
i' m scared .
what' s gonna happen to us ?
don' t worry .
when this is all over , i' il make sure you get back home .
home ?
it took me 1 5 years to get away from there !
i don' t wanna go back .
can' t we leave together ?
i' il be safe with you .
no , lupe .
i don' t think that would work out .
how can we tell unless we try ?
i think it' s gonna work out very well .
all right .
i' il answer it .
miss kennedy , i saw you at the casino with james .
we need to speak in private .
it' s all right .
he' s with me .
james is in danger .
sanchez is no fool .
he is checking up on him .
you know , if they find anything suspicious ...
it' s all right .
he' s out of the country by now .
you don' t understand .
last night he stayed with me .
at sanchez ' house ?
s .
franz is taking him on a trip .
they leave in an hour .
if anything happens to him , i don' t know what i' il do .
i love james so much .
you must go before you' re missed .
now , don' t worry .
we' il think of something .
i love james so much .
i' il be damned if i' il help him !
look , don' t judge him too harshly , my dear .
field operatives often use ... .. every means at their disposal to achieve their objectives .
bullshit !
bond' s just left in convoy .
two cars and a jeep , ...
.. turning north onto the main highway .
i copy that , q.
what are you doing to my plane ? !
overhaul .
senor sanchez order it .
i must have a plane .
where can i rent one ?
nada , senorita .
no planes .
you brought the stingers .
from now on i want them close to me .
we started this place strictly as a cover , but professor joe turns a tidy profit .
welcome .
this way , please .
i' m going to have to ask that each of you put on one of these .
it' s for your own safety , so i' m sure you' il understand .
we can' t have our best customers developing a ... drug habit .
this way , gentlemen .
our product dissolves completely in ordinary gasoline , ... .. making it absolutely undetectable .
how do you get it back ?
you want us to tell you all our secrets ?
before we' re partners ?
take them to the lab .
this way , gentlemen .
who' s the new guy ?
somebody i thought could be useful .
gracias .
can i help you ?
i have a surprise for professor joe .
sorry .
no visitors this week .
i came all the way from wichita falls .
i' m sorry .
we took up a collection .
we wanted professor joe to accept it personally .
you may remove your masks now , gentlemen .
so , do we have a deal ?
the terms were 100 million ... .. in negotiable bearer bonds from each of you .
professor joe !
it' s really you !
oh !
it' s magnificent !
rebuilt stone for stone and restored to all of its original glory .
is this for me ?
yes , i almost forgot .
i got so flustered ...
tell me , child , have you ever thought of studying here ?
would that be possible ?
come .
let' s see if you have the aptitude .
to a long association .
what' s the process ?
it' s very simple .
honorato , mustrales .
an 18 per cent mixture of cocaine and ordinary gasoline .
just keep quiet .
we already have your first shipment being loaded into the four tanker trucks .
welcome , my dear .
please join me .
wow !
this is my humble sanctuary , away from the cares of the world .
your own private meditation chamber .
built from the sacred rocks of the original temple .
i did have it soundproofed , so nothing will disturb our ... meditation .
i brought you another surprise .
i love surprises .
where is it ?
look , this really isn' t necessary .
give me the keys .
bless your heart .
your monthly delivery will be by ocean going tanker .
we' il send our chief chemist along to supervise the reconversion process .
you keep the gas ... as a bonus .
and if there' s a problem with customs , no evidence .
i know him !
he' s an informer !
you disappoint me .
who are you working for ?
huh ?
tell me !
you don' t wanna talk ?
i can get the trucks out , but i don' t think i can control the fire !
forget the fire !
get some cars !
we' re gonna take the tankers with us !
wait a minute !
this setup cost us 32 million !
we have to try and save it !
i don' t give a shit about the setup !
we' ve got 500 million in the case and 20 tons of colombian pure in the tankers !
go help heller !
we have a deal with the orientals .
we' ve got their money .
i said go help heller !
now , do you wanna make this hard or easy ?
put him in the conveyor .
when you' re up to your ankles , you' il beg to tell me everything .
when you' re up to your knees , you' il kiss my ass to kill you .
i' m the least of your problems .
if you couldn' t trust krest , who can you trust ?
who' s got your 500 million ?
truman lodge ?
what about the stingers ?
what do you know about stingers ?
we gotta go , patrn .
this place' il blow up any second .
where' s heller ?
i don' t know .
that' s the last you' il see of heller and your stingers .
thanks for the advice .
have my car meet me up at the top !
come with me .
you' re dead .
you took the words out of my mouth .
sanchez !
are you all right ?
switch the bloody machine off !
hey .
i was making sure these were secure .
it' s a good idea .
take them up to my car .
of course .
oh , god !
it' s heller !
yeah .
looks like he came to a dead end .
come on !
you .
come with me .
come on .

i think he may have a job for you .

iguanas are a girl' s best friend .
well , here' s to you , my dear .
cheers .
thank you for everything , james .
thank you .
you could stay here with me .
excuse me .
i think you and el presidente will make a perfect couple .

so why don' t you ask me ?
