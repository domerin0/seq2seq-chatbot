i' m going to the island !
we' re gonna have so much fun !
but i need to see you guys out there .
you can do it !
i won !
that was this week' s ...
we got a disturbance on elevator 12 , plaza level . ... just moments before his final departure to the island , nature' s last remaining pathogen free zone .
lucky guy , huh ?
you can be a winner too .
the next lottery is tonight .
the next lottery is tonight .
how long have you been here ?
two years .
what about you ?
three .
three .
i' ve been here seven .
if i do the math , that makes me the biggest lottery loser in the room .
i' m such a loser .
sir .
yeah , you .
swipe .
gandu three echo , you' ve been flagged for public disturbance before .
yes , i had a very small emotional outburst , sir .
safe to say it' s over ?
yes , very safe .
i' m feeling much better .
well , then , have a pleasant day .
thank you , you too .
you both have a pleasant day too .
feel the stretch .
one more breath in .
but i was in that section .
no , i don' t understand !
i tried !
i tried to do the best i ...
listen to me !
remember , be polite , pleasant and peaceful .
a healthy person is a happy person .
lincoln six echo , choices are fruit , oatmeal and any type of bran .
no bacon today ?
you got a nutrition flag , means no bacon .
in that case , two eggs , over easy , not too runny , and a side of sausages .
maybe some french toast and a little powdered sugar .
you ain' t cute and i got no time for your lip , six echo .
now , what' s it gonna be ?
move it .
surprise me .
surprise .
yummy .
next .
watch and learn .
next .
jordan two delta .
hi , honey .
hi .
choices are powdered eggs , dried fruit and yogurt .
eggs , please .
ok .
so , where were you the other day ?
we missed you .
that' s nice of you to say , sweetheart .
get you anything else ?
maybe a little bacon .
no , it says i shouldn' t .
go ahead .
four , five pieces , please .
thank you .
well , good luck .
gotta run along now .
you' re not going .
you gotta stay for dinner .
i softened her up for you .
no doubt .
back on your diet ?
you kidding ?
i love this stuff .
better eat up .
you' il need all your strength tonight .
is that a challenge ?
i promise i' il go easy on you .
please separate .
find your seats now .
yeah . " ' who wants sally ? ' said dick .
' i do , ' said jane .
' i cannot find sally .
get up , dick .
get up and help me find sally .
is sally here ? " '
dr. merrick will see you now .
what' d you do wrong this time , tough guy ?
sir ?
you wanted to see me ?
yes .
please .
please , sit down .
so , how is lincoln six echo today ?
not so good , i guess .
why do you say that ?
well , if i' m here , it means i' m not so good .
that' s a rather negative association .
my only job is to see that you' re happy , things are ok with you .
right .
your file shows that you' ve been interacting regularly with jordan two delta .
there' s no law against friendship .
no .
no , we encourage it , but , obviously , proximity could become a concern .
i know the rules of proximity .
you' ve been doing quite well in most other areas .
proficient at work , exercising rigorously .
but screening has picked up some trace levels , changes in your metabolism , and you' ve been having nightmares .
are you saying there' s something wrong with me ?
why don' t you tell me about your dream ?
well , it' s the same dream every time .
i' m on a boat , headed to the island .
a boat ?
what kind of boat ?
a nice boat .
draw it for me , would you ?
so , you are heading toward the island .
what happens then ?
i drown .
really ?
why do you think that is ?
i don' t know .
you tell me .
maybe you' re afraid of winning .
why would i be afraid ?
you tell me .
what' s troubling you , lincoln ?
well , it' s ...
it' s just ...
all right .
tuesday night is tofu night .
and i' m asking myself , who decided that everyone here likes tofu in the first place ?
and what is tofu , anyway ?
and why can' t i have bacon ?
i line up every morning , and i' m not allowed any bacon for my breakfast .
and ...
let' s talk about all the white .
why is everyone wearing white all the time ?
it' s impossible to keep clean .
i always get the gray stripe .
i never get any color .
and i hand it in to be cleaned , and someone cleans it , and folds it neatly back in my drawer , but who ?
who is that person ?
i don' t know .
i just ...
i wanna know answers .
and i wish that there was more .
more ?
yeah .
more than just waiting to go to the island .
lincoln , it' s your nature to question things .
but don' t you realize how lucky you are ?
that you survived the contamination .
that nature has left you a garden of eden to repopulate .
that , lincoln , is your purpose .
right .
and you ?
arert you going to the island too ?
no .
my responsibility is to make sure this facility continues to operate .
that' s why people like me , my staff and supervisors , we ... ... we can' t win the lottery .
let me see that .
you draw well .
renovatio .
what does that mean ?
i don' t know .
it' s always in my dream .
i' d like to run some tests on you , lincoln .
what sort of tests ?
nice tests .
come with me .
take a seat .
ok , let' s get you comfortable .
swing back .
i thought these were nice tests .
it' s a synaptic brain scan .
totally harmless .
don' t worry , it' s painless .
it hurts .
not really .
yeah , it does !
no , it doesn' t .
yeah , it really , really does !
the micro sensors will move along your optic nerve .
they' il be uploading readings to us over the next 24 hours , after which , you' il pass them through your urine .
now , that might hurt .
six echo , you' re late .
jones , you ever get bored doing this ?
doing what ?
this .
i never really thought about it .
i think about it a lot .
about what ?
this boring job .
what are we doing here ?
we' re feeding the nutrient lines .
we eat food , food' s gotta have vitamins , right ?
it' s good for us .
you don' t ever wonder about anything ?
where do these tubes go ?
they start there .
and they go ... right there .
hey .
did you get a look at the new guy ?
seven foxtrot .
they found another survivor .
they keep finding them .
he' il probably win the lottery .
straight down , in the hole .
there you go , you try it .
straight down in the hole .
in the hole .
no , no , no .
put it down .
did we all look that stupid when we went through decontamination ?
lottery' s supposed to be random , right ?
right .
what if it' s not ?
what if it' s rigged ?
rigged ?
i' ve been working on this .
here .
take a look at that .
it charts the last 20 people that won a spot on the island .
excluding , of course , the women , picked to be breeders .
what is this ?
i took the first letter in each name .
i assigned it a point value system , based on the alphabet ,
like the last guy , starkweather , s equals 15 .
q equals 15 , s equals 19 .
do you see what i' m saying ?
no .
well , maybe if you would listen to me , i' m trying to tell you .
you string the numbers together .
you divide it by the amount ...
you multiply ...
you divide it by the amount of ...
you divide it ...
you divide it by the amount of people , which is 25 , a thousand plus five , 2500 .
you know what that spells ?
j o n e s.
i' m winning the lottery tonight .
did you pack ?
no .
gentlemen ,
i' m gonna go mess with foxtrot .
there you go .
straight .
straight down in the hole .
there you go .
straight ...
what ?
he had something on his ...
ok .
go .
lima !
are you ok ?
what' s wrong ?
code 15 , we need med techs stat !
lima one alpha .
let' s give her some air , ok ?
you' re gonna be ok , all right ?
relax and breathe .
can i get a wheelchair ?
it' s for lima one alpha .

i think it' s time .
lima , you' re going to the island .
we' re going .
oh , you' re so lucky .
i hope i see you soon .
everyone , please follow her out .
quickly and carefully .

we got live wires all over the place here .
hey , i' ve been looking all over for you .

i' ve been looking ...
can' t hear you .
i' ve been looking all over for you .
if you go and get yourself contaminated , don' t come pointing the finger at me .
how you doing , mac ?
what are you doing here ?
my chip fried again .
yeah .
how much longer do you think that one' s gonna work ?
what are you two clowns looking at ?
hey , you got any of that stuff on you today ?
oh , look , it' s break time .
come on .
you' re a bad influence on me .
must be why i like you so much .
what' s it like where you live ?
in sector five ?
it' s fine .
you know , it' s like any other sector , i guess .
i like coming out here , talking .
most supervisors don' t like to talk .
yeah .
step into my office .
are these your friends ?
yeah , sometimes .
where are their clothes ?
what' s with dr. merrick ?
you mean why does he act like he' s got a filing cabinet shoved up his ass ?
yeah .
it' s called a god complex .
all doctors are like that .
they think they know everything .
what' s god ?
well , you know when you want something really bad and you close your eyes and you wish for it ?
god' s the guy that ignores you .
oh .
right .
tech service requested in product extraction .
yeah , i' il be right there .
oh , hey .
let me get that .
where do you get that stuff , anyway ?
it' s an old stash .
you know , from before .
you mean from before the contamination ?
yeah .
come on , you' re killing me with questions here .
you got a sweet deal here , you know ?
because you' re , you know , like , special .
why ?
why am i special ?
there' s another question .
you remember what we talked about ?
you don' t tell anybody about our conversations ?
' cause that can get me in big trouble .
no , i don' t .
good .
how' s it going ?
hey , how are you ?
how' s your world ?
ok , i' il catch you later .
chinese junk locked up again , huh ?
yep .
what a surprise .

you' d think with the money this place rakes in
they could afford decent equipment .
yeah .
ready ?
cut the o2 .
seriously , unless you want to see me blow chunks , can you wait till i' m gone ?
sever the umbilical .
cutting .
breathe .
come on , yeah .
that' s it .
come on , breathe .
breathe .
come on .
come on , come on !
breathe , breathe !
there we go .

vitals seem fine .
smooth extraction ?
yep .
looks like we have a fine product .
tag him and ship him to foundation .
little bug .
maybe next time i won' t embarrass you in front of your friends .
it was very sad .
hey .

stim units restricted .
yeah , yeah .
i' il have the veggie stuff .
papassian petal juice , please .

jordan , are you sick ?
when i was in dr. merrick' s office , i thought i saw your name on a file .
no , i' m fine .
ok .
how are you ?
i' m fine .
lincoln , i can tell when you' re lying
' cause your mouth smiles but your eyes don' t .
i found something .
what ?
a bug .
a bug ?
a flying bug .
can i see it ?
i think it came in the ventilation shaft .
i thought they went extinct with the contamination .
i know .
and how did it get by the pathogen sensors ?
it must be too small .
no , it' s not too small .
how did it survive out there , anyway ?
how does anyone survive ?
they keep finding people , but where do they come from ?
it' s good that they find survivors .
why do you always question the good ?
you only think about the bad .
i just have a feeling that something is wrong .
good things do happen .
i want to see that bug .
hey .
gandu learned a new word from the censor .
what ?
" dude .
dude " ?
what does it mean ?
he just called me dude .
hey , dude .
he said " hey , dude " ?
d o o d. " dude .
hey , dude .

lincoln six echo remains in quarantine after contamination exposure .
jordan two delta was safely transported to her new home on the island .
jones three echo , i need you to concentrate in this lab .
sir , i want to focus more than anything .
i love my job .
it' s interesting .
but lincoln six echo has been contaminated , and it really worries me , because he' s a good friend of mine .
he' s one of my best friends .
my only best friend .
he' il be fine , three echo .
sir , i have one question .
where do all the tubes go ?
the human organism .
unique in all the universe in its complexity .
the product of three billion years of evolution .
perfect in every way , except one .
like all machines , it wears out .
for centuries , the idea of replenishing the human body has been at the forefront of science .
we need to turn this bad day into a good day .
how ?
a terrific day .
by selling .
by selling .
sell , sell , sell .
you start , i finish .
ladies and gentlemen , welcome to the next generation of science , the agnate .
an organic frame engineered directly into adulthood to match the client' s age .
you' re looking at stage one this way , sir .
in its development .
within 12 months it will be harvest ready , providing a carrier for your baby , a second pair of lungs , fresh skin .
all genetically indistinguishable from your own .
and , in compliance with the eugenics laws of 2015 , all our agnates are maintained in a persistent vegetative state .
they never achieve consciousness .
they never think or suffer or feel pain , joy , love , hate .
it' s a product , ladies and gentlemen , in every way that matters , not human .
this is our public relations director , mr. whitman .
he' il be happy to answer any questions .
once again , thank you .
mr. whitman .
i want to talk about the smartest investment you' il ever make .
and i want to tell you how you' re gonna live 60 to 70 years longer .
dr. merrick , albert laurent , blackhawk security .
you come highly recommended by the defense department , mr. laurent .
though i' m unaware of your personal qualifications .
my men are ex delta force .
seals .
i was formerly with the glgn , french special forces .
i understand you had a corporate theft .
yes , that' s what i told the defense department .
the reality is a little more complex .
that' s why i require your services .
we' ve had a ... security breach .
you have the defense department at your disposal .
why call me ?
because their investment here is sizeable .
one hundred and twenty billion dollars , to be exact .
and i can' t afford for them to reconsider .
what you tell them is your business , doctor .
i am in the business of keeping my clients ' confidence .
good .
two of our products have escaped .
impressive , considering they' re vegetative .
well , after several years of trial and error , we discovered that without consciousness , without human experience , emotion , without life , the organs failed .
how long have they been missing ?
four hours and 36 minutes .
they' re on foot ?
yes .
wade , 1 . 2 miles an hour , five mile perimeter ,
standby for suspect description .
we' re on it .
follow me .
come on , we gotta keep going .
i have to stop .
i can' t run anymore .
you gotta try .
where ?
anywhere but here .
but there' s nothing .
everything' s dead , lincoln .
what if we are contaminated ?
then we' d be dead .
there' s no contamination .
it was a lie .
what is it ?
i don' t know .
but it' s alive .
come on .
it' s mean , whatever it is .
let' s rest in here .
jordan two delta' s sponsor , sarah jordan , is in a coma after a car accident .
she' s in need of multiple transplants .
how long does she have ?
forty eight hours .
three days maximum .
tell me about six echo .
he was really the first one to question his environment , his whole existence here .
over the last few months , he began demonstrating unstable behavior and i can' t account for it .
i' m waiting on the result of his synaptic scan .
what do they know about the outside world ?
very little .
we control them with the memory of a shared event .
a global contamination .
it keeps them fearful of going outside .
the island is the one thing that gives them hope , gives them purpose .
everything we expose them to , their programs , their can' toons , books , the games they play , are designed to manage aggression and reinforce simple social skills .
to avoid obvious complications , they aren' t imprinted with an awareness of sex .
we find it simpler to eliminate the drive altogether .
in a very real sense ... they' re like children .
educated to the level of a 15 year old .
what was that ?
i don' t know .
but i want one .
look !
route 39 .
route 39 .
come on .
i got it from a friend .
i think that' s it .
what' s up ?
yeah , do you know a guy named mccord ?
yeah , we know that tool .
who' s asking ?
i am .
and you would be who ?
lincoln six echo .
jordan two delta .
right .
y' all some of those desert ufo freaks ?
u ...
what ?
no , i don' t think so .
no .
mccord ?
well , lucky day , captain kirk .
he' s in the can .
he' s in a can ?
taking a dump .
a dump ?
taking it where ?
bubba , you' re fixing to get on my nerves .
it' s the first door on the right .
thank you .
i have to go .
he' s taking a dump in a can .
something to drink ?
jack ?
yes , please .
straight up ?
oh , that is bitchir .
so this is sector five ?
hey !
you son of a bitch !
you knew !
how the hell did you get out ?
why do they lie to us ?
tell me !
they' re gonna be looking for you .
tell me what' s going on !
if anybody sees us together , both of us are gonna be dead .
so , will you just take your hands off me ?
let me ...
let me pull my pants up and i' il take you back to my place so we can be alone .
ok ?
ed .
mac .
give you ... give you boys a minute ?
what ?
this isn' t what it looks like .
sure .
sure .
get out of here , you stupid ...
will you stop ?
you can' tjust bust in on a guy like that .
that' s really rude .
she doesn' t understand the licking .
you a knucklehead ?
you brought another one ?
excuse me .
hey .
hey , hey !
hey , hey !
back off , joe , ok ?
don' t push me !
no , no , no , that' s no good .
put it on my tab .
we gotta go .
friends from out of town .
come on , sweetheart .
give me your number .
two delta .
hey , look .
get ...
don' t test me .
don' t .
well , this is nice .
mac doesn' t talk much about his work at the institute .
do y' all work with him ?
saving lives and all must be real rewarding .
those are fancy tracksuits .
y' all exercise out in this heat , gonna get yourself nasty heatstroke .
oh , mac , look .
they got matching bracelets .
we should do that , honey .
suzie ...

yeah .
actually , would you run down to red' s and pick us up a sixer of bud ?
we' ve got to talk shop .
ok , baby .
just making friends .
i know .
good .
just ...
bye .
why do they lie , mac ?
why do they lie to us ?
tell me .
to keep you from knowing what you are .
what we are ?
what are we ?
man , why do i gotta be the guy tells the kids there' s no santa claus ?
ok , look .
you' re ...
well , you' re not like me .
i mean , you' re not ... human .
i mean , you' re human , but you just , you' re not real .
you' re not , like , a real person .
like me .
you' re clones .
you' re copies of people out here in the world .
what ?
clones ?
what ?
why ?
what are you talking about ?
some hag trophy wife needs new skin for a facelift or one of ' em gets sick and need a new part , they take it from you .
but i have a mother .
i remember her .
yeah , i know .
i grew up on a farm .
i have a little dog and i had a bike .
and a bike .
right .
it was a pink flexi flyer with little tassels on the handlebars and you rode it to your grandmother' s .
you ring the little bell and she came out and served you cookies .
yeah .
no .
memory imprints .
i seen them .
a buddy of mine is a programmer at the institute .
he showed me .
there' s only 12 stories .
they change around little details , but they' re all pretty much the same .
the life you think you had before the " contamination , " it never happened .
come on , don' t look at me like that .
at least you had a bike .
wanna trade your rosy memory implants for my shitty childhood , be my guest .
how long ?
how long have we been alive ?
you' re echo generation , so you' re three .
delta means you' re four .
three ?
the whole reason you exist is ' cause everyone wants to live forever .
it' s the new american dream .
there' s people out there that are rich enough to pay anything for it .
don' t people care that they kill us ?
that they take parts from us ?
they don' t know .
they think you' re vegetables simmering in a jelly sack .
why do you think merrick has you stuck in an old military bunker below ground ?
he doesn' t want anybody knowing the truth , especially not sponsors .
sponsors ?
the people that had you made .
they , like , own you .
but why doesn' t merrick want our owners to know that we' re alive ?
just because people wanna eat the burger doesn' t mean they wanna meet the cow .
besides , do you know how many laws merrick' s breaking to have you two hatched ?
your sponsors can' t have any part of that .
they' re like high society , rich and famous .
if they knew , merrick would be out of business .
we have to find our sponsors and tell them the truth .
what ?
yeah .
no , that' s the worst idea i ever heard .
you know how dead i' d be ?
not to mention fired ?
we will .
we will .
that' s our only chance .
stop , stop !

why , yes , of course .
there is something going on around here .
something you may not even know about .
what is it ?
well , i' m not sure that the contamination is real .
why do you think that ?
ok .
lincoln told me that he found a flying bug in sector six .
wow .
right .
and i think that might be why he thought he could leave .
have you told anyone else about this ?
no , no .
but i' m gonna do some digging .
i' m gonna get to the bottom of this .
and when i do , i' il share my information with you .
thank you .
i want to be helpful .
i like it here .

but i really want to look into the lottery too .
something' s wrong there .
yeah .
you know , you were one of the first of the echo generation .
you' re very smart .
yeah .
i remember when i first came here .
a survivor , just like you .
one of the first , in fact .
it' s natural , even healthy , to question the world we' re presented .
you might say it' s only ... only human .
oh , that burns !
get me a list of all the echos in active population .
i saw his address .
tom lincoln .
we' il go there when the rain stops .

oh , my god .
my name is lincoln six echo .
i' m your insurance policy .
and what are you doing in my house ?
sir , sir .
you need to see this .
it' s a ...
it' s ...
it' s beautiful .
this is a synaptic scan we took of six echo three years ago , before we integrated him into the agnate population .
ok ?
this is his scan from a few days ago .
you can see how much the memory' s grown .
like he' s experienced 30 years , not three , which is impossible .
or maybe this is scarring from a cortical infection that we didn' t ...
an infection can' t teach you latin , or how to fly .
they are memories .
but they' re not his .
they belong to his sponsor .
i' ve seen you before .
i' ve seen you in maxim , esquire ...
maxim ?
oh , they' re mers magazines .
pictures of women with little , tight , short ... ... stories too .
anyway , you' re very popular .
there we are .
what is that ?
that looks like some kind of thermal ...
boy , your skin is so soft .
did you know ?
i put some clothes out for you upstairs .
thank you .
no , thank you .
i keep expecting to wake up .
i thought i was taller .
i' m sorry to disappoint you .
come here .
she is unbelievable .
how is it you' ve been around three years and end up with the kind of woman
i haven' t been able to find my whole life ?
give me that .
she found me .
she' s my best friend .
why do we sound different ?
i' m from scotland .
i' m from scotland .
hey , look .
you' re creeping me out enough without that .
without that .
no , really , cut it out .
that' s enough .
yeah , that is enough .
i' m sorry .
like a freak show .
yeah , it' s weird .
so , you build boats ?
i design them .
i draw them , yeah .
here .
i started off with cars , motorcycles .
experimental designs .
anything that blew my hair back .
kind of a speed freak , you know ?
petrol head .
motorcycles , wow .
i feel like i' ve seen these before .
it' s something i' ve always done .
i never dreamt it would make me rich .
what' s renovatio ?
renovatio " in latin means rebirth .
subtle , eh ?
look .
i have cirrhotic hepatitis .
a parting gift from god for all my philandering .
what ?
lots and lots of sex .
sex ?
sex with ...
you' ve ...
you' re a virgin ?
you' re kicking around with her and you' re a virgin ?
ok , i' m not gonna spoil the surprise , but , boy , are you in for a treat .
look , my doctor said that my liver will start failing within the next two years .
i' m not good at all this shite , you know ?
confessions and regret .
look .
there are people who are following us .
they' re trying to kill us .
the reason we came is we need your help .
help you do what ?
to show people what the institute does .
but who' d believe it ?
i' m looking at you and i don' t .
who is that guy ?
i know him .
is he the community announcer ?
he' s the president of america .
he has a clone .
he' s an absolute idiot .
yeah , i never liked him , either .
do a lot of people see this ?
the news ?
a lot .
then if we can get on there together , people will see us and know the truth .
so the idea is that we both just waltz down to nbc and see if they can slot us in after the weather .
this might not mean anything to you , but there are thousands of us .
everyone we' ve ever known is gonna die in that place .
help us .
all right .
let me just get my shoes , ok ?
tom , hurry up !
merrick institute .

she said she was going out of state ... ... to look for her sponsor .
you' ve been witness to certain trade secrets .
you mean that they manufacture human beings who walk , talk and feel ?
that kind of secret ?
have you talked with anyone else about this ?
who would believe it ?
can i count on that ?
the only thing you can count on is that people will do anything to survive .
i just want to live .

about half .
the foxtrots , gammas and helos .
we predicated our entire system on predictability .
human curiosity .

cisco ip communicator .
connecting to merrick biotech .
this is charlie whitman , the public relations director at merrick biotech .
my deepest apologies for yesterday' s unfortunate inconvenience you had .
your defect in your policy wasrt , by no means , an isolated incident , and it is totally correctable , i assure you .
we are calling other valued clients right now to inform them of a recall , so , please , call us when you get in ...
unfortunate inconvenience ?
that' s a bit of an understatement .
mr. lincoln , you' re home .
arert you traumatized , sir ?
i mean , i had a home invasion once where they put the gun to my head .
i never forgot that .
i shook for two days .
what kind of recall are you talking about ?
oh , it' s a small defect that we found in four of our product lines .
what are you gonna do with the defective products ?
starting over .
starting over ?
absolutely nothing to worry about .
we guarantee our product 100 percent .
the unfortunate inconvenience for you is we' re gonna have to re scan you so that we can re grow your policy .
does today work for you at all ?
pick you up by helicopter at 3 : 00 ?
i' il call you back .
dr. merrick , how do we remove the defective products from the population without disrupting the others ?
we already have the mechanism in place .
dahlgren two foxtrot .
cooper five gamma .
mass winnings .
he kept a journal and a lot of maps .
after i figure out how to get that thing in the water , then we can get on it and ... ... we' il keep heading south .
we could live like real people .
tulie two foxtrot .
ginsberg two helo .
we' il disappear .
yeah .
but after .
all those people we left behind .
jones three echo .
when we were escaping ,
i saw this room .
if i could get in and shut it down , they' d see the truth .
gentlemen , there is , however , another matter that requires board approval .
the disposal of 200 million dollars of infected product .
all in favor ?
aye .
aye .
aye .
you' ve been chosen .
you' re special .
very special .
thank you .
thank you .

in bound , jordan product .
escort her to surgery prep seven .
i better say hello .
mr. lincoln , thank you for coming .
it' s great seeing you again , and we are so , so sorry about this entire episode .
i want to tell you that we are going to be birthing a brand new agnate for you free of charge .
wort cost you a penny .
after you .
would you like an apple ?
an afternoon snack ... ?
no .
how long will this take ?
it' s gonna take about an hour .
i read that you' re from scotland .
i prefer ireland .
but what part in scotland ... ?
i realize that this small talk is just part of yourjob ,
but let' s cut the shite , ok ?
point taken .
my apologies .
i' m just a bit of a jabberjaw .
chatty cathy .
turn right .
this way .
i' il take her .
this is gonna be the exact same routine as last time .
mind the hose .
technician will be here .
look at you , so young and successful .
i always wanted to get into yachting .
i hear they' re taking your kidneys , your lungs , your heart .
they are gonna hack you up .

no one is touching me .
give me your tri key .
you shot me .
shut up !
give me your walkie !

you all right ?
yes .

i' ve got this figured out .
i kind of ...
i messed it up in one area right down in there , but the hole doesn' t matter .
something' s happening .
something' s happening .
hello , sir .
hello .
thank you for your patience .
i' m sure you' re excited to get to the island .
if you grab your belongings and line up in a single file line and follow me , we' il be on our way .
take this .
go .
you have to keep going .
go .
go .
ok .
go shut it down .
i love that picasso .
do you like picasso , mr. laurent ?
you delivered on your promise .
well done .
i' m very pleased .
thank you .
what about the client ?
sarah jordan ?
she' s doubtful .
even if the transplant' s a success , her brain damage may be too severe for any real recovery .
you took too long bringing her back .
the girl , you' re going to harvest her , kill her anyway , even though it won' t make any difference ?
that' s the privilege our clients pay for , mr. laurent .
now , do excuse me , i have business to attend to .
you know my father was part of the burkinab rebellion ?
and when he was killed , me and my brothers were branded , so others would know we were less than human .
i' ve seen and done things i' m not proud of , but at some point you realize war ... ... is a business .
so when did killing become a business for you ?
oh , it' s so much more than that .
i have discovered the holy grail of science , mr. laurent .
i give life .
the agnates , they' re simply tools , instruments .
they have no souls .
the possibilities are endless here .
in two years ' time , i will be able to cure childrers leukemia .
how many people on earth can say that , mr. laurent ?
i guess just you and god .
that' s the answer you' re looking for , isn' t it ?
mr. whitman has your check downstairs .
looks like single gunshot .
oh , no .
wrong wrist .
dr. merrick , the body thatjust came in ... ... is the client .
issue a security alert !
lincoln six echo !
down , down , down !
move , move !
disturbance in the hologram room .
i' m on it .
dr. merrick , i sent censors to check a possible attempted breach in hologram control .
one after another , step into the room .
if i' m going to the island , why did i leave my bag ?
step right in , thank you .
are you sure you know what you' re doing ?
is this the right way ?
i ...
are you new here ?
i don' t know if this is the way !
it' s going to the island !
i' m almost positive that you' re going the wrong way !
open the door !
she said open the door !
you could have taken over his life , but you chose to come back .
you truly are unique , six echo .
my name is lincoln !
i brought you into this world ...
... and i can take you out of it .
