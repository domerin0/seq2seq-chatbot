i can' t hold her much longer .
she' s taking on too much water .
what is going on back there ?
keep your pants on , murphy .
we blew the starboard engine .
port engine' s way too hot .
hold on .
shorten the tow or cut her loose .
epps ... ... get off my damn tugboat .
we don' t have much time .
move it , epps .
if she sinks , she' s taking us with her .
got a punch in the port floater .
five minutes before she floods .
less than that !
get back here .
we' re cutting her loose .
cut her loose .
that' s it .
get back here .
come on !
you heard the man !
took us three months to get her off the bottom .
i will not lose her now !
goddamn it , epps !
you can' t fix everything !
christ !
for the last time , get back here !
she' s taking on too much water !
why do you always have to break my balls ?
i said get back here !
do you want me to come down there and kick your ass ?
because i' il do it .
here' s to the best damn salvage crew in the business !
we did it , guys !
yeah , look at that !
all right .
nice work .
here' s to the fucking sea !
to the sea .
to a job well done .
mr. murphy ?
i' m jack ferriman .
i was wondering if i could buy you a drink .
he doesn' t drink .
could i talk to you alone ?
you talk to me , you talk to my crew .
that' s the way it is .
i fly the arctic weather patrol flights out of mackenzie bay .
last month i was out in the middle of the strait when i came across this .
congratulations .
you found a boat .
in the middle of the ocean , of all places .
i tried for radio contact and got nothing ... ... so i figured she had to be adrift .
in the bering strait ?
that' s miles from shipping lanes .
did you alert the coast guard ?
it' s international waters , so they noted it and that' s it .
you get a name ?
no , i put it out of my head until two days ago when i saw it again .
what are we talking about ?
what kind of tonnage ?
big .
huge .
could be military .
let' s say that we' re a little bit interested .
what' s in it for you ?
i want 20 % finder' s fee , whatever she' s worth .
have you told anyone else about this ?
not a living soul .
give us a minute , will you ?
okay .
so ?
what do you think , murph ?
who knows ?
could be full of shit .
i do know one thing .
i' ve seen strange things happen in the strait .
sea gives you an opportunity , take it .
that' s at least a week out of our way .
we' ve been out for six months already .
i got a fiancee waiting , remember ?
i' m getting married in a month .
plan was to go back to anchorage .
starboard diesel needs an overhaul .
there is no plan .
if you don' t want to go , that' s fine .
let' s tell him we' il get somebody else .
wait a minute .
let' s not be hasty .
what' s a ship like that worth ?
who knows ?
millions ?
thousands ?
could be nothing .
depends on a lot of things .
mainly , if we have the right to salvage .
pretty big " if .
what' s the split ?
we split it even , six ways .
even split ?
beats me paying you overtime .
i' m good .
i' m in .
greer ?
what do you say ?
all right .
hey , ferriman !
can you come over here ?
so this is the way it works .
10 % instead of your 20 % finder' s fee .
i can' t let you take advantage of me like that .
that' s the way it is .
take it or leave it .
fine .
but i go with you .
not on my boat , you don' t .
think i' d tell you where a fortune might be without insurance ?
there are five other boats that would jump at this .
i come with you .
so you take it or leave it .
things are dull !
she' il love it .
what do you think ?
too much off the sides , but i can come up with something she' il love .
shave that yourself .
don' t want to help me out ?
who the fuck are you kidding ?
everybody knows you navy boys take it up the ass .
enjoying the ride , jack ?
no , sir .
not the same as flying planes over ice sheets , is it ?
what' s the appeal ?
i could ask you the same thing .
what' s a nice girl doing in a dump like this instead of raising a family ?
i own a third of murphy' s operation .
i' m not that nice .
and these monkeys are my family .
santos to murphy .
come in .
yeah ?
i think you should get up here .
what is it ?
i think you should see this !
it was there a second ago !
ten miles to the northwest .
would you turn off that fucking music ?
i' m telling you , there must be a glitch .
i saw it with my own eyes .
glitch , my ass .
there' s nothing there .
give me a look at this .
there it is !
right in front of you !
tell me you don' t see nothing .
do you see what i' m saying ?
do you see what i' m saying to you ?
dodge , could you get on the bow light ?
all right , murph .
it' s there , right ?
there' s something there .
hey , murph , what' s up ?
vessel at position 7 5 north ... ... this is arctic warrior .
come in .
this is tugboat arctic warrior .
do you read me ?
this is arctic warrior .
do you read me ?
come in .
shit !
now do you believe me ?
holy shit !
an ocean liner ?
where did that come from ?
it' s the antonia graza .
jesus christ .
this is civilian tugboat arctic warrior .
is there anyone aboard ?
this is civilian tugboat arctic warrior .
is there anyone aboard ?
this is arctic warrior .
can you read us ?
you know her , murphy ?
only in my dreams .
christ , she' s beautiful .
italian liners couldn' t compete for speed , so they built floating art palaces instead .
she was reported missing may 21 , 1962 , off the coast of labrador .
funny thing is , there was no distress signal .
she just disappeared .
ever since , every captain' s been looking for her , hoping she hasn' t gone down .
do you know what this means ?
what ?
under the law of the sea , she' s ours .
let' s not keep a lady waiting .
santos , bring us alongside .
fire up the crane .
we got business to do .
when we get onboard , stay together .
we don' t know what kind of shape she' s in .
take us up , greer .
aye , aye , captain .
hey , murphy , please remember to keep all channels open .
thank you .
they won' t let me go .
safety first .
that' s why you go last , jack .
can you sit down ?
i' m trying to keep this steady .
i just want ...
sit down !
get out of the way !
okay .
she' s had some battering over the last 40 years , you can tell .
stand by .
setting you down topside .
she' s still a beaut .
unbelievable .
you better stay alert .
watch your step .
40 years of rust can turn deck plates into quicksand .
we' il make our way in at the fore , then check the bridge .
this way .
careful .
forward mast is history .
epps and murphy , are they a couple ?
hell , no .
she' s like a daughter to him .
he' d be lost without her .
superstructure' s in decent shape .
no sign of damage .
lifeboats are gone , stern to bow .
life preserver lockers are all empty .
sure no survivors ever turned up , murph ?
sure as we' re walking on the graza , dodge .
this way .
let' s go .
jesus .
she' s no fiddler' s green .
you' re wrong , munder .
she' s beautiful .
whoever was on here originally sure left in a hurry .
murphy , come in .
ladies and gentlemen , welcome aboard .
i' m julie .
i' il be your hostess this evening .
have some respect , okay ?
check out all those champagne bottles .
looks like we missed one hell of a party .
and one hell of a hangover .
shut up !
shut up !
let' s find the bridge .
such a manly man .
what ?
you all right ?
shut up !
come on , mary , let' s go .
murph , how many passengers did she carry ?
over 600 .
the creme de la creme of society from all over europe .
crew of 500 from italy .
talk to me .
how' s everything going ?
okay , good .
this companionway should get us to the bridge .
here , epps , hold this .
what' s going on ?
after you .
no , after you .
no , no .
after me .
tough guy .
don' t let go !
pull !
pull !
please , epps !
please , epps , don' t let go !
give me your hand .
pull us up !
oh , god !
i told you to watch your fucking step !
oh , shit .
oh , jesus .
from now on , you let me lead .
okay ?
let' s go .
i think i just shit my pants .
no , you always smell that way .
compass is dead .
helm' s not responding , either .
fuel tanks are empty .
she must' ve rode on full throttle till she was bone dry .
epps !
i' m looking for the ship' s log .
let' s get this documentation back ...
are you okay ?
yeah .
you sure ?
yeah .
let' s get to it .
hey , check this out .
it' s a watch .
congratulations , buddy .
no .
look again , you moron .
it' s a digital watch .
do the math .
they didn' t have digital watches in 1962 .
so we' re not the first people to board this ship .
but she' s ours now .
let' s get some sleep , tow her at dawn .
let' s hope there' s no more surprises .
amen to that .
oh , god .
epps , can i get some tea ?
any sign of what might' ve happened ?
how she got here ?
that' s the $64 million question , isn' t it ?
ever hear of a ship called the marie celeste ?
twin masted brigantine out of charleston during the civil war .
she was bound for london with a cargo of cotton .
thanks .
two months after she set sail , she was sighted by fishermen off tripoli .
she was doing 12 knots an hour in a stiff breeze .
something wasn' t quite right .
they didn' t know what so they went onboard .
you know what they found ?
nothing .
no passengers .
no crew .
no captain .
no sign of distress .
59 days after the last log entry , it had traveled 4500 miles across the ocean ... ... past the rock of gibraltar and into the mediterranean sea at full sail .
and nobody at the helm .
what do you make of that ?
a ghost ship .
hey , you smell that ?
i smell bullshit .
been on the sea a lot longer than you .
i know .
seen things that you can' t even imagine .
maritime history is full of marie celestes .
so , what' s our plan ?
i think we should do what we came to do .
tie her up , tug her in .
you think our little tug will pull this entire ocean liner ?
not with the problems we got .
we could set her at anchor and come back with two or three tugs .
no , some russian trawler will come along .
i' ve already looked for her anchors , anyway .
they' re gone .
what do you think ?
get the engines working ... ... it could take us two weeks minimum to tow a vessel this size .
for my share of what she' s worth , i' d drag her back to anchorage myself .
don' t let go !
help me !
don' t let go !
thought you might want a jacket .
thanks .
boy , do i miss that .
you okay ?
you seem quiet since you came back .
i think i saw something i couldn' t possibly have seen .
like what ?
no , it' s crazy .
i' m curious .
tell me .
i think i saw a little girl .
on ...
on the ...
the boat ?
yeah .
looking right at me .
and then what happened ?
nothing .
she disappeared .
sometimes , when i' d be flying for hours on end ... ... i' d think i' d see stuff too .
it' d be there one second and gone the next .
like a dream .
thanks .
see you in the a . m .
okay .
good night .
see you tomorrow .
yeah .
she' s got a big hole .
she' s sinking .
this is where the damage is .
see ?
breach in the hull , about 10 by 20 ... ... torn to the port collision bulkhead .
did it hit an iceberg ?
no , you don' t need an iceberg to rupture a hull .
she' s been hit recently .
about a week ago , i' d say .
this is where we are .
the problem' s this group of islands .
nothing spectacular ... ... just rocks , a couple thousand seals .
the antonia graza' s caught here in this strong current loop ... ... and slowly she' s been pushed towards those rocks .
last time she hit them .
what about next time ?
won' t be one .
we' ve got three days to fix it .
that' s if the weather holds .
why can' t we tow it like it is ?
it' d be like towing a car with four flat tires .
it' s a bump in the road .
we can fix it .
murph , bump in the road ?
the breach we can probably patch if we can get to the inside .
we' il weld shut the flooded compartments , pump out the water up to the aft peak .
on top of that , the rudder' s jammed .
we jerry rig it , set a 38 degree current drift to clear the island chain .
what does all that mean ?
i just ...
that' s a lot of work for three days .
but with the gear we' ve got onboard and what' s on that ship , we can try .
we can do it , right ?
with the gear we' ve got onboard , i can' t fix our engine .
quit bitching and overhaul the starboard engine .
so that' s the plan ?
just do it .
i' il call it in .
i wouldn' t do that if i were you .
maritime law states ...
i know .
we just don' t want any unexpected guests .
just leave it .
your call , captain .
all right , you know the drill .
we do a complete recon .
make sure we' ve got no problems before we get to work .
stay with me , greer .
don' t wander .
okay .
dodge , munder , go to the port collision bulkhead .
jack and i' il work back from the fore .
call if you need anything .
how about a pizza ?
you' re so funny .
the only plan in this business is that there is no plan .
what is that ?
what these people talking crazy for ?
that' s not even good english .
hang in there , okay , preciosa ?
because someday he' il find some other genius to fix his boat .
you want to play like that ?
it' s still sweet , though .
light coming up .
you were right .
she is beautiful .
she sure is .
epps , we' re heading for the main engine room .
epps ?
all right , capitano .
oh , shit .
we' re gonna have to dive to get to that tear .
epps , the engine room is totally flooded .
epps , can you hear me ?
wait !
what happened ?
you okay ?
what are you doing down there ?
did you hurt yourself ?
what are you doing ?
the whole bottom' s riddled with them .
looks like someone used it for target practice .
that' s the happy version .
what' s the not so happy version ?
there were people in there .
i saw that little girl again .
what ?
where ?
i must be losing my goddamn mind .
well , did she say anything ?
forget it .
come on .
murphy , come in .
dodge !
anybody !
shit .
i think she' s fucking with us .
looks like central laundry .
this vent connects to the forward hold .
we need to see if it' s flooded .
i may need help shutting it .
you sure we need to ... ?
murphy , where the hell are you ?
how long have they been here ?
a month , maybe less .
what are we gonna do ?
get off this boat !
but the ship ...
lf it sinks , it sinks .
you' re right .
stinks .
what the hell ?
we came through there .
no shit !
come on !
this way .
come on , jack .
what the ... ?
when' d you start wearing lipstick , epps ?
epps ?
francesca .
nice titties .
not that you can hold a candle to the future mrs. greer , though .
come on , jack .
stop dragging ass !
what' s your problem ?
what' s this ?
forget it .
let' s go !
jack !
' 58 jaguar x150 .
i' ve dreamt about this car since i was a kid .
we have to get out of here now .
do you understand ?
now .
there' s something moving in there .
fuck !
oh , my god !
i hate rats !
what ?
oh , my god !
look at this !
i have to get murphy .
murphy !
is someone trying to call me ?
dodge !
munder !
maureen ...
who' s maureen ?
it' s my first name .
it' s cold ...
he said " cold " ?
the galley .
it' s cold .
please help us .
don' t go in there .
you fucking assholes !
fuck you !
take it easy !
you were fucking with us .
we fucked with you .
why aren' t you laughing ?
wanna hear something funnier ?
we found dead guys in the laundry room .
and this in the cargo hold .
need some help , skipper ?
i' m sorry .
jesus .
oh , man .
holy shit !
yeah !
we' re rich !
you son of a bitch !
rich !
come on .
let' s go .
move this shit out !
one .
two .
three ...
how much you figure it' s worth , boss ?
there' s a lot of gold .
hard to know .
two , 300 million , maybe .
maybe more .
jesus .
i don' t know .
lock boxes with half of fort knox in them ?
they gotta be insured .
no way somebody will let this much gold float away .
well , the markings have been filed down .
what does that mean ?
someone didn' t want this traceable .
it' s stolen .
it may have to do with the reason this ship disappeared when it did .
wait .
if the gold' s got something to do with 1962 ... ... what about the bodies ?
they can' t be more than three weeks old .
somebody' s gotta say it , and it might as well be me .
this ship is fucked up .
earlier i could swear i heard a woman singing .
it' s like she was ...
like she was coming on to me .
oh , no !
