jiminy .
let' s get .
oh , i' m coming , i' m coming .
come on .
come on , baby .
no , no , darling , they ve waited long enough .
i ve waited .
oh , how i' ve waited for you .
each day a lifetime centuries longer than the day before it .
and it would' ve been ...
would' ve been ...
almost bearable .
and it would' ve been almost bearable ... if just once , you' d written a letter that you were still alive ... and that your love for me was still alive too .
how could i have known you lost both your arms in battle ?
damn you .
haven' t i told you never to speak of that ?
you foolish , proud man .
don t you see it doesn' t matter ?
you can still touch me .
still a heart to love me .
still lips to kiss me .
you can touch me without arms ... and i need you to , darling , desperately .
please touch me .
touch me now .
touch me right now .
blah , blah , blah .
god , it' s awful .
well , you' re good .
really ?
i mean , not just compared to you ?
a glass , please ?
oh , well , i don' t have any yet .
sorry .
i find it awfully sad , really .
well , i' m going to get some .
no , not that .
you know , a person can pursue something .
a girl can go after her dreamland give it her ... energy , labor , sweat , tears ... and this is where it gets her .
a two room apartment and a role in some moronic period play .
things take time ?
right , things take time .
i suppose , but i can' t wait forever .
can i ask you something ?
sure .
you can ask me anything .
who' s the girl with the camera ?
she' s called ' jane . ' why ?
well , she took my picture out here .
she didn' t say a word , just took my picture and disappeared .
it was weird .
she is weird .
you know what ?
i d be careful if i were you .
she took pictures of me once , and now she hates me .
hates you ?
why ?
i have no idea ... except i think she s maybe slightly insane .
insane ?
hey , this is steve .
i m not here right now ...
hi , i' m jones .
i' m your neighbor from down the hall .
i think we' re past that .
right .
i noticed you take pictures , and i can' t seem to figure this out ... so i thought maybe you could ...
i don' t know much about them .
is this one any good ?
yeah , it' s fine .
fine if you' re going to disneyland with the wife and kids .
right .
well , i guess i' il have to plan a trip , then .
and a wedding .
here .
point and shoot .
right .
how did that picture come out , on the roof ?
not so hot .
what did you say your name was ?
i' m jane .
bye , jones .
ready ?
beer ?
no , no , this calls for wine .
i have a terrific bottle i' ve been saving .
you have a corkscrew , right ?
damn .
here , let me .
it' s a sticky one .
and that' s how it started .
she opened the wine and started to pour ... and pour and pour , like words on a page ... big words like ' ambition ' and ' inspiration ' and ' passion ' .
me ?
i didn' t say much , but she didn' t mind .
she knew i was watching her .
i think she likes to be looked at , but i wanted to do more than look .
after all , i couldn' t type , could i , if i didn' t touch the keys ?
and she was so close .
it should have been easy ... but somewhere , somehow , i think i missed something .
you know what i mean ?
yeah .
you do ?
no .
you don' t ?
i don' t know .
i' m sorry .
it' s late .
i m drunk .
i have to go .
morning , partner .
shouldn' t i have handcuffs too ?
sorry , partner .
i' ve only got one pair .
don' t you think we should drink them first ?
no .
you' d never hit them that way .
that' s right .
steady .
use your sight .
line it up .
now , what are you going to do ?
squeeze .
squeeze .
what are you not going to do ?

lisa ?
yeah , upstairs lisa .
how do you mean ?
well , you' re seeing her , aren' t you ?
did she say something to you ?
no .
i just know .
how ?
it' s an old house .
i know the creaks .
i know what goes on .
when she' s in her bathroom brushing her teeth ... putting on a bit of eye makeup .
i hear her move from her apartment to yours .
you let her in .
she looks great .
she takes a seat on the couch , makes herself comfortable .
you offer her something to drink and excuse yourself to the kitchen .
' mineral water ?
or i have a light beer . '
' mineral water , please .
in a glass , if you don' t mind ? '
mineral water ?
oh , come on .
it' s not like i' m snooping , really .
i just hear it .
there' s a lot of turnover upstairs .
everybody leaves a story behind .
now , i could tell those stories , but i don' t .
and i won' t tell yours either , jones .
together this time .
six on the left are mine , right are yours .
i love what you' re doing with the place .
thanks .
it' s called acting .

i can hear you breathing .
jane ?
listen to me , you pathetic bastard .
how did you know it was me ?
you think you' re cute , don' t you ?
oh , for christ sakes , jones .
you cook a meal for a man just once .
he thinks he can call you on the phone .
what he thinks is that he' s got god given right to tell me ... what to do , where to go , and what time to be there .
maybe he wants to show youth world .
istanbul .
mozambique .
what are you talking about ?
you know what i' m talking about .
my father .
you said he' d been everywhere , seen everything .
that he' d written it all down .
every sight , every sound .
so that he could show you the world .
i never told you that .
he told me that .
i remember more than you think i do .
i' m getting dressed here , jones .
what did you do , blanche ?
what did you do that was so bade left both of us ?
if you gave school half the energy you give this little genealogy project ...
i bet they' d name building after you .
i am taking it seriously .
in fact , there' s an instructor here now .
oh , instructor , hell .
what instructor ?
it' s art class .
we' re doing nudes this week .
but she said i could sketch some gin bottles for extra credit .
i' il send you one .
how i ve waited for you .
each day a lifetime centuries longer than the day before it .
and it would' ve been almost bearable ... if just once , you' d written me that you were alive ... and that still loved me too .
damn you .
i thought i told you never to speak of that .
never .
i know you got it , you chicken shit .
you can still touch me .
still a heart to love me .
still lips to kiss me .
you can touch me without arms ... and i need you to , darling , desperately .
please touch me .
touch me right now .
at least someone' s been rehearsing .
it was bad , wasn' t it ?
you can tell me .
you were good .
can you say that again , please , with just a little bit more feeling ?
you were good .
will you kiss me ?
okay because you want to , or okay because i asked you to ?
i want to .
will you do it now , please ?
okay , i will , but ...
sorry .
i' m not very good at this .
oh , but you will be .
you will be .
what are you waiting for ?
this isn' t your first time , is it ?
what ?
are you serious ?
jones , my god .
what do you think this is ?
nothing .
i mean .
god , exactly .
you know what ?
you can' t do this with me .
not like this .
i mean ...
you' re really sweet and everything , but my god ... how old are you anyway ?
seventeen .
seventeen ?
my god , what am i doing ?
you know what , jones ?
you need to fall in love first .
love ?
yes , love .
seventeen year olds can fall in love .
by the time i was 17 , i' d already loved three or four boys .
like really , truly , loved them .
you' re right .
of course i' m right .
trust me .
you don' t want to do this .
you' re right .
you think you do , but ...
what did you say ?
i said , you' re right .
right about what ?
about this , about us .
i don' t want to , like you said .
what ?
okay , the show' s over .
i m through being an audience .
just looking on and listening .
i want someone who' s more than words ... because if i ve learned anything , it' s this : talk is cheap , partner .
so you say it' s a party you want ?
hell , i' il show you a party .
what did i say about coming down and celebrating ?
damn it , i got dishes at home that need washing .
you done crossed me for the last time .
speak up , damn it .
i' m talking to you .
oh , dear god , help me .
it' s jones dillon , coming to kill me .

you' d best say goodbye to them buttons , you no arm son of a bitch .
mr. dillon .
you have a shave scheduled , mr. dillon .
a shave .
and a bath .
that' s me .
but this animal said he was going to roll me down main street .
down main street , right out of town , one kick at a time .
squeeze .
with spurs on , jones .
i need a ride .
you didn' t have to do this .
that' s okay .
i' ve been meaning to buy some records .
we don' t sell records .
i thought you said it was a record store .
it' s just called a record store .
it s all cds .
right .
i don t have a record player anyway .
i don' t care if you don t like the picture , okay ?
what picture ?
it' s not going to hurt my feelings .
you could' ve at least acknowledged it .
what picture ?
the picture i gave you .
the picture i slipped under your door .
i put it in an envelope and ...

oh , goddamn it .
she likes you , right ?

no .
i don' t have a cd player either .
will you need a ride home ?
no .
i' il manage .
how about you ?
okay , shut it off .
that' s great .
how do you know all this stuff ?
i learned it from rocky .
who' s rocky ?
that motorcycle in my apartment ?
that' s rocky .
he left that behind , the rogue .
he was my last .
he lived in your apartment for a while , but he spent most of his time in mine .
then he moved on .
that was three years ago .
it' s been three years since i had sex , jones .
didn' t you say ' whoa ' ?
three years and you say ' whoa ' ?
three years of celibacy deserves more than ' whoa . '
' whoa ' doesn' t come close .
try 17 .
what , years ?
well , the first 12 were pretty easy .
but what about ... ?
so you' re a ... ?
it' s great .
it' s really great .
it' s the pain .
the pain ?
that' s why i like it .
because it' s honest and it' s real ... and it' s nothing you can faker hide .
to me , it' s like you' re feeling pain for the first time in your life .
and before this moment , you didn' t even know it existed .
i broke my arm once when i was a kid .
how is it someone you' ve just met , a person you hardly know ... can somehow know you ?
can take one look at you ... and see more in that instant than most people will ever see ?
i suppose there' s only one way to find out .
hi , jane .
hi .
hi .
i was wondering if ... if you' d like to go out or ... ?
you' re a little young for me , jones .
besides , i don' t date .
well , it wouldn' t be a date .
i don' t know many people here , and i thought maybe we could ...
maybe you should get a record player .
well , we don' t have to .
i don' t do movies .
no dinners , no picnics ... no walks .
how about you decide ?
i hear you typing a lot .
what are you writing ?
letters , mostly .
letters to whom , your girlfriend ?
girlfriends .
there are several .
is that right ?
get the fuck out of here .
superfecta is the big one .
the first four horses in order are bitch to win , but top dollar pay .
trifecta is the same deal , but first three horses in order .
still' s a bitch , still good money .
exacta bet is firsthand second in order .
quinella is the same , but in any order .
so those are good .
win , place or show bets ... you can figure out for yourself .
are you talking to me ?
yes , dummy .
how do you want to bet ?
i have no idea .
how about you bet for me and i' il get us some drinks ?
sure you will .
how did you do that ?
a trick i learned from my mother .

little bee .

little bee , run .
i used to go there a lot with steve ... and he always lost his ass .
i guess that s why i can still stand it there .
this is the part where you ask me who steve is .
no , it isn' t .
fair enough .
then i' il ask you something .
name ?
age ?
seventeen .

no funny accent .
i grew up in the east , mostly .

i thought you didn' t want to know .
he' s your old boyfriend ?
one of several .
are you telling me you' re an orphan ?
not exactly .
how many is several ?
wouldn' t you like to know ?
i just want to know about one .
that' s it .
out of film .
that' s it ?
why ?
you thought you were getting somewhere ?
so is there anything else i should know about you ?
i don' t think so .
unless ...
what ?
no .
spill it .
i' m a virgin .
never ?
all those girlfriends and no action ?
i almost did once .
really , when ?
recently .
how recently ?
pretty recently .
i want to tell you something .
if you want to hang out with her , you don' t hang out here , okay ?
i' il hang out here .
okay .
i' m sorry .
i' m sorry about the kiss .
so , what do you know about jane and steve ?
can' t do it .
sorry .
can' t do what ?
can' t say .
it' s one of those upstairs stories .
sorry .
but you know ?
can' t say .
but there' s something to know , right ?
is there ?
damn .
partner .
she' s at your door .
i didn' t think you were home .
i' m not .
i wasn' t .
but i am now .
now i am .
want to go for a ride ?
in a half an hour ?
blanche is in texas .
who ?
blanche , my mother .
you asked me about my parents .
she lives alone .
drinks .
dates mostly men from the country club .
she ran my father off when i was 3 .
or 4 .
her story always changes .
what ?
this is the part where you tell me about steve .
is that right ?
i used to work in this shitty little bar .
steve came with his band , like ... they were playing a stadium show or something .
and for the next three nights , he sang every song for me .
i had never met anybody like him .
he said all the right things , did all the right things .
everything was so right .
then he fucked it all up .
me especially .
you seem okay to me .
i used to be better than okay .
new in town .
how are you ?
how do i look ?
you look great .
how' s your arm ?
i' il pull through , i think .
thank god .
i' m miserable , jones .
that must hurt pretty badly .
no .
i' m so bored .
right .
maybe you should get a record player .
shut up .
you know what i want ?
i want you to write me a letter .
a letter ?
yeah , those you write to girlfriends .
but just a ' letter ' letter , not a love letter .
i don' t have any girlfriends .
i write them to someone else .
well , i' m someone else .
write one to me .
no , i mean ...
i don' t send them .
it' s complicated .
jones , i' m in the hospital .
i think i deserve at least a letter .
i knew that something like this was going to happen to you .
no , blanche , really , i' m fine .
i m going to pull through .
you see , jones , this is what happens .
i tell you things , and you don' t listen .
you don' t ever listen to me , do you ?
well , you don' t ever tell me what i want to hear .
don' t you start .
this is about you .
this is about reality .
i' m going to have to hang up .
i ve got breakfast coming .
there' s a place that delivers bagels and belly dancers .
it' s fantastic .
are you drunk , jones ?
what are you talking about ?
here she is .
you can set that down anywhere .
how did he find out ?
i called him .
you were bored , so you called .
wrong .
i missed him , and i wanted to call him , so i did .
didn' t he fuck you up or something ?
what' s your problem , jones ?
i thought we were friends .
he came 2000 miles , jones .
she can' t help herself , jones .
it s a biological weakness ... for the black leather / guitar player type .
i' ve experienced bouts of it myself .
it' s powerful stuff .
well , it' s good .
really .
i' m happy for her .
she seems happy too , which is good .
it' s great .
grab your hammer , partner .
did you see jane' s car ?
what happened to your arm ?
you were with her .
well , i' m glad you' re okay .
what about jane ?
she' s okay .
i' m glad .
when something like this happens ... it makes me wonder if i should tell her i' m sorry .
well , it was the deer' s fault , mostly .
is that for me ?
i write them to my father .
i don' t send them , because don' t know his address .
because i don' t know if he' s alive or dead .
nothing .
only you .
okay .
say it .
only me .
i' il be leaving soon .
i know .
i don' t mean just from the hospital .
i know .
hey , guy .
oh , the famous copilot .
jones , right ?
right .
yeah .
how' s the arm ?
you fucked her , didn' t you ?
what ?
you ?
but it was nothing .
nothing ?
jane took pictures of her .
sexy stuff , where she was wrapped in these scarves ... and i wanted to find out what was under there .
but ... it was nothing .
and i mean , jane took it pretty hard .
jane takes everything pretty hard .
what am i telling you for ?
you don' t even have a cd player .
you' il be glad to know i' m recovering from the accident .
and that girl i told you about ?
she' s as good as new .
what i can' t figure out is , how could i have been so stupid ?
how ?
you' re listed .
that brad person downstairs , he told me which apartment , so ...
that brad person ?
yeah .
do you know he made a pass at me ?
wouldn' t you know it ?
you look nice , blanche .
then ask me to sit down .
well , thank you , mr. sophisticated .
i got a motorcycle .
well , isn' t that nice .
maybe i should throw myself off this roof ... save the trouble of having to bury you .
i don' t think the fall would kill you , but you could try it .
tell me about this jane person .
skip the part about her being lousy driver , though .
i don' t know .
she' s a lot like you , actually .
that' s exactly what happens .
boys always chase after girls that remind them of their mothers .
she drinks , she' s rude , and she s loud ...
yeah , okay .
shut up , will you ?
is she pretty ?
she' s beautiful .
what about you , blanche ?
are you making anyone miserable on a regular basis ?
if that' s your cute way of asking if i' m in love with anybody ... ... the answer is no .
come on , blanche .
well , sure , there might be times when i' m sweet on a man .
i like to feel good as much as the next girl .
but don' t confuse feeling good with being in love , jones .
no , those two roads , they rarely cross .
rarely or never ?
why are you still dragging around that beat up trunk ?
that' s all i have .
that and his typewriter .
well , why don' t you see if you ve got a blanket in there for me .
i guess it' s getting late .
we' il talk tomorrow .
tomorrow .
jones , watch the road .
it' s beautiful .
you guys are unbelievable .
well , all i did was beat on it .
how would you like to drive it ?
around the block , or 2000 miles one way ?
i' il do it .
why would you do it ?
we' re friends , right ?
yeah , we' re friends .
poor guy .
he' s crying .
crying , wow .
i' il only be gone for a couple of days .
shut up , jones , and drive .
right .
' i' m sorry , jones .
i don' t have any answers .
not many anyway , and probably none that would make you very happy .
no one ever looked at me the way your father did .
he didn' t see a pretty girl with a rich daddy . '
he saw someone with hopes and dreams of her own .
and i would have followed him anywhere .
well , we only got as far as a little cabin in a motor court .
i made eggs and toast in the kitchen , and we laughed , made love ... and drank whiskey .
i wasn' t more than 50 miles from home , but it felt like 5000 .
and those two little rooms , they felt like the whole wide world to me .
but for him , i think it was just another dot on another map .
i' m sorry , jones .
i know i told you a lot of pretty things about your father ... things i wanted to believe too .
but the truth is , you never met your daddy .
one day he went out for cigarettes , and he never came back .
these letters of yours are hilarious .
i wish you' d let me show this one to steve .
where i' m tied up in the trunk and you come to my rescue .
i know what he did .
what who did ?
i know what he did .
trying to get me drunk ?
i tried to pretend it didn' t happen ... that i didn' t know , that i couldn' t see it in his face .
but why ?
why pretend ?
because i didn' t want to go back to the way it was before .
with steve , there' s no yesterday , no tomorrow , just now .
always and forever now .
for the first time in my life , i knew what it felt like to be free .
let me try .
i could do it , jane .
i could rescue you .
you are so nice .
i could fuck lisa if nice is a problem for you .
we' re too much alike .
i could see it in the photos i took .
i can see it now .
are you afraid of the dark ?
i thought you' d want it .
you can switch it off .
this is not happening .
say it .
this is not happening .
you know , i' ve been some places .
texas .
delaware .
three schools in new hampshire .
kansas .
not everywhere , so maybe i' m wrong .
but i think you' re probably the most beautiful woman in the world .
what did you say ?
nothing .
you said something .
i said , we' re here .
hey , guy .
i can' t believe this piece of crap actually made it .
you can' t do this .
don' t .
what' s that ?
that stays .
right , the top secret funny stuff .
what was i thinking ?
last night did happen .
please , jones .
what happened last night ?
nothing .
nothing happened last night .
yes , it did , and it wasn' t nothing .
it was something .
stop it .
this something i should know ?
no .
yes , it is .
in your dreams , kid .
what are you doing , jones ?
steve , stop it .
stop it .
get in the car , jones .
i want to talk to you .
why did you do that ?
jane , what are you doing ?
come on , open up .
you' re better than this , jane .
you' re better than okay .
come on .
give me a minute .
give me a minute .
last night was now , wasn' t it ?
there was no yesterday , no tomorrow , and it still is now .
it' s not too late .
jones , it is tomorrow .
i' m here .
i cannot go back .
does it hurt ?
i want you to take the car .
i don' t want the car .
take it anyways .
you fixed her .
you put her back together .
somebody called the cops .
let' s get the hell out of here .
yeah , let' s go , man .
piece of shit car .
let' s go .
let' s go .
hello .
it was me , wasn' t it , blanche ?
all these years , i blamed you .
i thought it was your fault .
but it was me , always me .
jones , where are you ?
why didn' t you tell me the truth ?
he left because you got pregnant .
because ...
oh , honey .
because i didn' t want you to feel the way i did .
i thought i could at least do that for you .
what , so you could send me away to school ?
and every summer .
no , that was your granddaddy' s doing .
he said that i' d never make for any kind of a mother ... and i should just take care of it .
you were my chance , jones .
that he might come back .
i was your chance that he' d come back .
no .
i knew he wasn' t coming back .
you can' t stop some people , jones .
they come into your life destined to leave it .
you can wrap your arms tight around them .
the best that you can hope to do is just slow them down a little ... because there' s no holding on tight enough .
but you were mine .
you were my chance , and i blew it .
no .
you didn' t blow it , blanche .
jones .
guess what .
you' re moving out .
guess why i' m moving out .
you got a part .
yes .
it' s a musical on a cruise ship , so my stuff is going into storage ... and i' m going to sea .
what happened to your eye ?
oh , it' s nothing .
congratulations , lisa .
i left you something .
it' s going to be worth something someday .
you want me to autograph it for you ?
i' il just hold on to it .
hi .
oh , brother , where you been ?
here , hit this , man .
check it out .
hey , what the fuck ?
what are you doing ?
what are you doing ?
what are you doing ?
no talk , no rock , no rap , no crap .
nothing but today' s best country , 24 hours a day .
wait a minute .
i know you .
what did i tell you , kid ?
what did i tell you ?
i think you dropped this .
this is a new shirt .
this is a new shirt .
don' t ever change that hair , okay ?
what the hell did you do to my car ?
sorry about that .
liar .
what happened to your motorbike ?
she just quit on me .
nothing lasts forever .
right .
do you still think i' m the most beautiful woman in the world ?
shut up and drive .
