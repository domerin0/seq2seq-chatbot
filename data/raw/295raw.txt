i never heard of him .
who ?
the man you recommended .
the guitar fighter ?
wiped out a couple towns single handedly .
a real nut .
yeah .
you heard of him .
you just didn' t know it was him they were talking about .
you should meet him .
me .
me .
that' s me .
as long as i' m not the guy that has to make the introduction .
were you in mexico during the barillo cartel massacre ?
no .
that' s when i first heard about him .
he was a legend .
they used to say he was the biggest mexican they' d ever seen .
that was total bullshit .
he was 5' 9 " , 5' 1 0 " , tops .
that' s no record , but bigger than most of us .
but marquez , that' s a different story .
<i>marquez . </ i>
<i>marquez . </ i>
<i>gen .
marquez . </ i>
<i>powerful , dangerous . </ i>
<i>marquez , he really had it in</ i> <i>for this mariachi , see . </ i>
<i>they called him " mariachi" </ i> <i>because he used to carry this guitar . </ i>
a guitar ?
believe me , he really knew how to play it too .
look , this story is well traveled .
it might have picked up some embellishments along the way .
just read between the lines .
<i>now , he may not have been</ i> <i>the biggest mexican ever ... </ i>
all right . ... but she was as deadly ... ... as she was beautiful .
there' s a girl ?
oh , yeah .
there' s a girl .
when he' d run out of ammo , she' d take over .
the most drop dead gorgeous woman you' il ever see .
that' s where all the trouble began .
she was with marquez .
and when marquez saw that she was with the mariachi , well , he went crazy .
he hunted him down and fought mariachi to the death .
and then she ... ... put a bullet in his heart .
only he didn' t die .
i don' t know what happened after that .
would you like some ?
no .
maybe marquez caught up with them , or the cartels .
but like i said , the man is a myth , a legend .
and if he' s still living , he' s the one you want .
well ... ... that is truly unbelievable .
well , i' m not big on telling stories .
where' s the money ?
that' s the reason i' m here .
i couldn' t find a briefcase small enough ... ... for $10, 000 in cash .
it' il do .
just for my own edification , i offered you 50 .
why' d you say no ?
i' m not a greedy man .
not looking to get rich quick .
besides , 50, 000 is a lot for what you wanted me to find out , you know .
you may as just as well put a bullet in my head as cough it up , right ?
but 10 ?
ten thousand is civilized .
ten is something we both can live with .
ten might still be too much .
you' d kill me over $10, 000 ?
you wouldn' t dare .
you wouldn' t dare .
yes , i would .
would you do me the honor ?
you need to learn to play .
that' s why you' re here .
i hear this is a town of gunmen .
we only make guitars here .
mariachi .
which one ?
i don' t know who you mean .
i' m honored to be in your presence .
but there' s someone else who wants to meet you .
keep it .
he made that for you .
you know , if i was you , son , i' d turn around and go back right now .
go back to where i came from ... ... instead of selling my mind and my soul to these cocksuckers .
you speak english ?
i didn' t think so .
attempts have been made on me and my family by the cartels .
the same cartels that are threatening our freedom ... freedom which we must defend to the death .
i present to you senor blascoe .
please sit .
we hear you want to work for us .
i too am ready to start a new life .
this is your lucky day .
did you order my <i>pibil</ i> ?
does it have a name ?
they call him " el .
as in " the .
i know what it means .
thank you .
alert the barillo cartel ... ... that el has come out of hiding .
i don' t think we should  are you a mexican ... ... or a mexi can' t ?
i' m a mexican .
good .
then do as i say .
nice tune .
something my brother taught me .
i killed him .
yes , i was privy to that information already .
how charming .
you know , el , if i may call you that ... ... i' ve been doing a little snooping around , and it seems that the cartels ... ... have quite a price on your head .
i wouldn' t want to be you .
tell me , is there anyone who doesn' t want you dead ?
you tell me .
i need you to kill a man .
el , you really must try this because it' s <i>puerco pibil . </ i>
it' s a slow roasted pork , nothing fancy .
it just happens to be my favorite ... ... and i order it with a tequila and lime in every dive i go to in this country .
and honestly , that is the best it' s ever been anywhere .
in fact , it' s too good .
it' s so good that when i' m finished , i' il pay my check ... ... walk straight into the kitchen and shoot the cook .
because that' s what i do .
i restore the balance to this country .
and that is what i would like from you right now .
help keep the balance by pulling the trigger .
you want me to shoot the cook ?
no , i' il shoot the cook .
my car' s parked out back anyway .
you ... ... will kill marquez .
do you remember gen. marquez ?
he' s being paid by barillo ... ... to kill the president in an attempted coup d' tat .
attempted ?
oh , no .
the president will be killed ... ... because he' s that piece of good pork that needs to get balanced out .
i say " attempted " because we don' t want marquez taking power .
i need you to put the hurting , so to speak , on marquez ... ... after he' s killed the president .
savvy ?
so why me ?
you' ve got nothing to live for ... ... and , in a way , you' re already dead .
and marquez is the man who killed you .
so why not return the favor ?
go to the church .
meet with an associate of mine named salome at 3 : 00 .
and i will contact you afterwards if we have a deal .
was i right ?
i guess not .
the last shipment of guns that were seized at our border ... ... have not been accounted for , sanchez .
you are now off that assignment .
who wants to volunteer ?
okay .
you , gomez , it' s yours .
with <i>el presidente' s</ i> new campaign against the barillo cartel ... ... their activities are being pushed into the forefront .
large payments , deliveries , whispers of a political takeover .
i need new point men , strong and willing .
this is a top priority of <i>el presidente . </ i>
who wants this ?
romero , it' s yours .
pick your secondary person .
a third , if you have to .
that' s all .
dismissed .
i should take his left nut .
you' re with us .
people of culiacan .
i' ve come here to bring you a message of peace .
peace that at this moment is being threatened by a group of people that is threatening our nation .
people like armando barillo .
i invite you to gather our forces ... ... in order to prevent the destruction of our unity ... and our peace .
<i>el presidente</ i> , history teaches us no matter how great your armies are ... ... you will always need the favor of the inhabitants ... ... to take possession of a province .
how can you compete with a man like barillo ?
he owns culiacan .
he doesn' t own its people .
barillo purchased hundreds of homes and ranches ... ... in the northern part of culiacan .
and then he has turned around and given these homes to the people .
he' s a folk hero to them .
he' s also a mass murderer ... ... and a drug kingpin .
he' s trying to make himself a martyr by drawing the people to his side ... ... but the people can see through that .
men like barillo have stolen this country' s soul .
but my people will stand up for what is right .
i' m afraid they' re no longer your people , sir .
then i will die fighting .
are you with me ?
to the death .
what' s wrong ?
everything .
this way !
come on , come on , come on , come on !
any suggestions , miss " let' s get a room on the fifth floor ... ... so we can see the beautiful sunset " ?
jump .
swing , swing , swing .
hang on !
what do you mean , hold on ?
let go now !
give me that !
stop the bus .
stop the bus .
a vow must be broken .
forgive me ... for what i am about to become .
when was your last confession ?
an hour ago .
and the name of your priest ?
sands .
okay .
you are expected to carry out your assignment to the letter
yeah , i know .
failure to appear ... ... in locations at assigned times ... ... results in forfeit of protection , protection you will definitely need .
yeah .
you' il be paid .
coup d' tats , like elections , don' t come cheap .
so there' s plenty of dough floating around .
there' s more .
you will be a free man ... ... from marquez , the cartels , and even from the president ... ... who isn' t your biggest fan , let' s face it .
when do i begin ?
give me a moment .
it' s a church , <i>hombre . </ i>
i' m sorry .
are you still standing ?
still .
<i>good .
well , the barillo cartel</ i> <i>aren' t the nicest of guys , are they ? </ i>
however , you' ve passed the test .
you' re gonna do just fine .
assemble your team , and i will call you with further instructions .
<i>over and out . </ i>
i' m just walking my beat , friend .
mexico' s my beat , i' m walking it .
i throw shapes , and they catch them .
i set them up and watch them fall .
have him meet me at the bullfight at 5 p . m .
what ?
why would i want that ?
why would i want bubble gum ?
all right .
yeah , yeah , yeah .
okay , this should hold the both of us over for quite a long time .
so i don' t ever want to see you again .
fuck off .
hi .
hello .
the cla sharing a meal with the fbl .
now , if that isn' t interagency cooperation , i just don' t know what is .
i' m retired fbl .
a real agent never retires .
he just takes it a little easier .
why are we talking ?
you tracked down armando barillo ... ... for two years when he was running operations out of san antonio .
spinning wheels .
it never led to an arrest .
well , he
he is , in fact , sitting directly behind you .
i know .
he settled back in .
he' s been living here for six years .
can' t be touched .
did you know that most agents never even see a top 1 0 criminal ... ... for their entire careers ?
you brought down two , didn' t you ?
and now your third is sitting in very close proximity .
now , retired or not ... ... that has really got to tug on the old short and curlies .
i' m a civilian now .
didn' t he kill that agent friend of yours ?
what was his name ... ... archuleta ?
yes .
barillo is a mexican citizen .
he cannot be extradited for crimes committed in the u. s.
do you happen to know of a dr. guevera ?
worked for the cartel .
this doctor pumped your friend archuleta full of drugs , day after day ... ... so that they could torture him for two weeks before he died .
you must have known that .
dr. guevera himself having dinner with your prey .
i wonder what it is they' re up to now .
two weeks of torture , jorge .
think about that .
for your dead friend ... ... for the job you didn' t finish in san antonio .
now , are you really going to let it slip away again ?
i' d like you to have a bite of my pork because it' s ... ... the world .
it' s mariachi happy hour !
get your mariachi song for 5 pesos .
a mariachi kiss for 20 pesos .
and a mariachi fuck for only 50 pesos !
where the hell have you been ?
far away .
still fucking around ?
let me get fideo .
i' m here for my guitar .
it' s his last night .
they' re firing him .
hey ... ... fideo , it' s me .
still drinking .
like a fish .
i guess we haven' t changed so much .
i didn' t think you' d ever come back for this thing .
neither did i.
are we on ?
i' il let you know .
i' il let you know .
bring him sober .
we' re gonna need him , so ... ... coffee .
lots of coffee .
sometimes a revolution is exactly what' s needed to clean up the system .
one ... ... giant enema , which just so happens to be my area of expertise .
bullfights .
bull hockey .
do you like this ?
the bull is stabbed , prodded , beaten .
the bull is wounded .
the bull is tired before the matador ... ... ever steps into the ring .
now , is that victory ?
of course it is .
wanna know the secret to winning ?
creative sportsmanship .
in other words ...
... one has to rig the game .
go collect .
<i>el presidente</ i> is giving a speech on the day of the dead ... ... in the town of culiacan .
he' s going to be isolated ... ... in the main <i>edificio</ i> in the center of the plaza .
very easy access to him if ... ... somebody can get you in .
right .
you' re the man who can do that .
i am not the prince .
i am the man behind the prince .
i see .
he' s not the first prince i' ve served ... ... nor the first one that i' ve betrayed .
you' re a good rat .
i like you .
i try .
the rest upon completion .
<i>mucho gusto . </ i>
right .
right .
every goddamn time .
what do you want in life ?
belini ... ... how long have you and i done business together ?
a long time .
and in a way ... ... i kind of , almost , could have the tiniest smidgen of respect for you .
almost .
but you need to stop farting around .
now , do you have the information that i need on barillo or do you not ?
i have what you need .
i' m just enjoying this temporary position of power .
that make you nervous ?
you know that withholding vital information from a federal officer ... ... is a serious offense .
especially when that officer has paid handsomely for it ... ... and wouldn' t think twice about ripping that patch off your eyehole ... ... and skull fucking you to death .
no .
i' m fine .
go away .
i am fine .
go away .
you' re off the hook .
leave me alone .
that spill just cost you your life .
a little help .
okay .
i know it' s on you somewhere .
somewhere .
all right .
time to get messy .
well , i suppose i should thank you for not sticking it up your ass .
however .
you' re about a quart low .
you' re gonna pay for that , cop .
why doesn' t my key work anymore ?
it' s too small .
stand back .
i just i brought you a gift .
i' m still mad at you .
and trust me , it wasn' t easy to get .
so ....
come closer and i' il thank you .
are you trying to give me a boner ?
closer , i said .
how about that little tip off ?
guarantees you a big arrest and an accommodation .
even from your twisted little agency .
i' m impressed .
but then what ?
want to hear my plan ?
either that or i start target practice .
okay .
the new president is on a quest to clear out the barillo cartel .
and barillo has set up a counterattack ... ... by hiring a military general named marquez .
<i>he wants him</ i> <i>to throw a coup d' tat ... </ i> <i> ... while the president' s</ i> <i>visiting culiacan . </ i>
<i>now , i have a man inside</ i> <i>as insurance ... </ i> ... <i>to make sure that marquez</ i> <i>never takes power . </ i>
the last piece of the puzzle ... ... is barillo .
your tip off assures ... ... <i>that barillo is out of the picture</ i> <i>while the battle ensues . </ i>
<i>in the aftermath</ i> <i>of this very healthy revolution ... </ i> ... <i>i will calmly waltz away with</ i> <i>the 20 million pesos ... </ i> ... <i>that barillo is prepared to pay</ i> <i>marquez for the coup . </ i>
you want me to go with you ?
you detain barillo ... ... with the information that you have , then you join me ... ... and share the spoils .
you meet me two nights from now ... ... at la pileta , 10 p . m . sharp ... ... and bring only what' s important to you .
oh , yeah .
it might get a wee bit dangerous there , sugar butt .
so ....
can you dig it ?
i can dig it .
i want my key back .
testing .
one , two .
testing .
hello ?
can you hear me now ?
okay fucking bells .
did you assemble your team ?
you know i did .
why are you having me followed ?
<i>oh , yeah , that .
let' s just call that a ... </ i> ... guarantee of compliance , shall we ?
because cucuy also ...
<i> ... provides protection . </ i>
from what ?
mosquitoes ?
<i>oh , gosh , i really wouldn' t mess</ i> <i>with him if i were you ... </ i> ... because he' s a bit of a live wire .
<i>and he' s not the happiest</ i> <i>that you killed his man . </ i>
<i>oh , yeah , by the way, </ i> <i>i have your next assignment . </ i>
you the mariachis ?
this is the back entrance .
make a note of it .
hey , hey , hey , hey .
who are they ?
musicians .
why so heavy ?
built in amplifier .
play something .
all right .
let' s go .
i was afraid you couldn' t play .
are you kidding ?
what we are looking for is support from the people of this state .
a man can do a lot alone , but he can do better with his people backing him .
i wonder how much we' re getting paid for this shit .
a man who wants nothing is invincible , <i>cabrn</ i> .
hey .
are you gonna tell him that this is his last meal ?
is there a particular song you would like to hear ?
we just played for <i>el presidente</ i> , i can' t buy half a tequila with this shit !
it was meant as an honor .
fuck honor .
we need money .
the score' s tomorrow .
enough for all .
even for you , lorenzo .
why are you suddenly interested in the score ?
what' s in it for you ?
only revenge .
much delayed revenge .
go practice .
practice ?
playing or shooting ?
what do you think ?
i don' t think .
i drink .
yeah , hello .
been following barillo ...
... and the good dr. guevera .
oh , agent ramirez , no longer retired .
good man .
welcome to the fold .
i haven' t seen illegal activities yet .
only that dr. guevera is scheduled for a medical procedure ... <i> ... on november 2 . </ i>
the day of the dead .
that' s tomorrow .
also identified a member of the group as billy chambers .
a fugitive .
we' ve been wanting to pick him up for some time now .
billy chambers ?
yeah .
you sure ?
bet my badge on it .
<i>well ... </ i> <i> ... whatever they' re up to, </ i> <i>i can guarantee you ... </ i> ... that it' s going to happen tomorrow .
<i>so i suggest you</ i>  what' s going down tomorrow ?
if you see an opening , take it .
what do you know ?
not enough .
get inside .
i' ve got nothing .
i gotta get in .
i got nothing .
try to make a move .
i don' t have a move to make .
what are you gonna do , stupid ?
billy chambers is on the move .
where are you going ?
you' re buying a taco .
this is too easy .
where are the other guys ?
this is a setup .
it smells like a setup .
i' m making my move .
billy chambers .
well , that depends who' s asking .
i thought that was you .
here , let me pay for this .
oh , well , thanks .
oh , goddamn it .
is that real ?
yes , it is .
goddamn .
what took you boys so long ?
whoa , hey , friend .
you ain' t gonna need that .
believe it or not , man , i' m ready to go .
let' s talk over there .
after you .
man , i just wanna get out of here .
i' ve been on the run , hiding out here down in mexico ... ... for the last eight goddamn years .
and i' ve been working for this here cartel for the last four .
i ain' t got shit .
all i got is what i' m wearing on my back .
i can' t go nowhere .
sort of got me by the balls , you know ?
jorge ramirez .
i' il take you in under the fbl' s supervision and protection ... ... until we can take you back , where you will be prosecuted for your crimes .
in the u. s. ?
in the u. s.
the things that i' ve had to do for the goddamn cartel are ...
... unspeakable .
you don' t know what barillo' s up to ?
i' m close to the man .
i' m real close .
but he don' t let nobody in , that cocksucker .
can you get him close to barillo ?
him ?
i need your help .
then you get me out of here .
then i' il get you out of here .
him too .
him too .
there' s cartel on every corner .
sands told me you handle protection .
i don' t work for sands anymore .
and since i' m a mexican , i can do whatever i want .
then i guess i don' t work for sands neither .
goodbye .
there' s a price on your head .
i' m going to collect .
why don' t you just tell barillo everything you know .
and then maybe he' il just cut off your hands .
and if i don' t ?
you know that old man i killed in your village ?
what if your whole village was next ?
would you kill them ?
me ?
they certainly would .
then i guess i have no choice ... ... but to kill you all .
you ... ... are last .
that should put him out for a few days ... ... and give him some nasty dreams .
you have to relax your fingers .
music is pure , from one' s soul .
if the soul is pure , the music flows free .
and if the soul isn' t pure ?
then you must practice like a motherfucker .
i present to you ... ... senor cucuy .
get this condescending ass out of here .
you want me to break his fingers ?
no .
i want you to chop them off .
i was just making a joke .
i wasn' t .
sit , please .
so ... ... you are the man who brought us ... ... the mariachi .
the man i work for , mr. sands ... ... he is using the mariachi to kill gen. marquez .
so you want to join us ... ... here' s how it works .
there is the bait .
there is the trade .
a favor for a favor .
so el mariachi is the trade ?
you are .
this ain' t my line of work .
this guy' s all fucked up .
general marquez is arriving !
bring out the mariachi !
bring him out to the general !
i didn' t kill you before .
enough blood had been shed .
but i see now ... that blood will spill again .
general marquez , the mariachi is not here .
he escaped .
you too will escape .
hey , hey , hey , hey , lore
why ?
practice shooting , not drinking .
we are on .
by order of the president , they are searching all vehicles for guns and drugs .
that fucker' s been blockading all the roads .
take us back another way .
by order of the president .
who does this guy think he is ?
he wants to get rid of me ?
fine .
<i>i' il get rid of him . </ i>
<i>replace him , even . </ i>
<i>then i will simply disappear . </ i>
hey , <i>vmonos</ i> , man .
don' t put me out completely .
have my men wait outside .
barillo and dr. guevera must already be inside the building ... ... having entered through the back or basement .
they should be midprocedure .
federal agents .
this is going down now .
if barillo wanted to look unrecognizable to authorities ... ... he succeeded .
massive tissue loss due to an only partially completed ... ... facial reconstruction wasn' t necessarily the cause of death .
they switched bodies .
barillo !
fbl .
he was anyway .
bring him along .
listen , i cannot do everything by myself .
i need someone to go in there with me .
no .
i lost my inside man .
probably dead .
and cucuy , greedy turd that he is , ratted me out and has disappeared .
plus , i' m pretty sure the cartel is shadowing me .
now , listen , i have got a swell bunch of guys intercepting marquez' s army ... ... but they' ve got no guns .
i want you to understand me .
this is no time to screw the pooch ... ... because this is supposed to be the big dance number , all right ?
hello ?
hello ?
are you there ?
okay , okay , i' m going to freak right out .
i would like the <i>puerco pibil</ i> and a tequila with lime .
yeah , listen , i need a new line .
this one' s been compromised .
okay ?
thank you .
i' il be waiting here at the la vaca volando .
that' s right .
the flying cow .
you really didn' t see it coming , did you ?
sorry , baby , i told you i wasn' t interested in your scheme .
too small .
oh , my christ .
is that barillo ?
that' s the new barillo .
the old barillo died in surgery a few hours ago .
what kind of cartel would have you running its operation ?
i' m his daughter .
you' ve been spying on my operation for some time .
i feel it' s only fair to warn you that killing me is crossing the line ... ... and you will have every marine from here to guantnamo bay ... ... up your keister , mister .
so just know that .
fortunately for you , nothing you did is worth dying over .
you have only seen too much .
we are going to make sure that doesn' t happen again .
on this day of the dead ,
i offer you a chance for a new life .
that sounded a little extreme for a parade .
troops are coming up from the south .
whose ?
emiliano marquez .
well , what do we do ?
we stay here .
this place is fortified .
it' s much easier to defend this place than to chance going out in the open .
nicholas ?
what are you talking about , " fortified " ?
come here !
just stay clear of those windows , sir .
you let me handle it .
my name is sheldon jeffrey sands .
i work for the central intelligence agency .
i set them up .
i watch them fall .
i' m living <i>la vida loca</ i> .
no !
i' m terribly sorry about your chewing gum , but listen .
i will give you this ...
... if you' il be my eyes .
it' s a dollar .
i meant ... ... this .
i need you to take me to the center of the city .
is someone following you ?
it' s difficult for me to tell right now because i' m having a bad day .
do you see someone ?
yes , he' s getting close .
listen , have you ever seen one of these ?
have you used one ?
don' t ever , because they' re bad .
but what i need for you to do is to aim this ... ... at the bad man who' s following us and shoot him in the head .
kill him ?
oh , yeah .
very <i>mtalo</ i> .
close ?
okay .
smoke him .
smoke the fucker .
just send him straight to fucking broadway .
what ?
okay .
come here .
right or left ?
was that my right or your right ?
wrong man .
sorry .
look me in the eyes ... ... and then kill me .
good boy .
now you' re thinking .
take me to the center of the city , where there will be even more dough .
for you ... for our daughter ... for mexico .
in my past , i' d take on evil from the bottom .
now i realize ... ... start at the top .
the president is a good man .
i' il go around back .
meet me in five .
watch him .
we could torture him .
he' s fbl .
he' s retired .
that doesn' t count .
i was tortured once .
i didn' t like it .
you know what the fucked up thing is ?
they tore out my left nut .
that sort of turned me off of the whole thing .
what should we do with him ?
let' s go eat about it .
hey snow white , watch that fucking pig .
just lay low .
they' il leave us alone .
what the fuck ? !
i don' t like military .
get out .
why are we stopping ?
we can' t go further .
why not ?
look out there .
it' s a coup d' tat !
i can' t see , fuck mook !
i have no eyes .
well , then listen to it , fucker !
the military' s throwing over the presidency .
all hell' s broken loose .
you guys have to get out now .
keep your money because i' m not moving one inch .
fuck !
now what ?
do you know armor piercing bullets ?
yeah .
these are much better .
what do you want in life ?
good choice .
you ready ?
yeah .
okay , let' s go !
it' s no longer safe to be here .
let' s go .
you have a meeting with gen. marquez , sir .
it feels like you need some protection , sir .
who are you guys ?
sons of mexico , sir .
are we in front of the building ?
okay .
this is it , kid .
