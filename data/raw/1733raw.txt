i' m just here for my things .
you won' t find them there .
i' ve already packed them .

how are you doing ?
you can' t go on like this .
you need to get a life .
i have a life , like everyone else .
don' t smoke in here .
you have to get a grip .
we were talking about you yesterday .
that' s when i remembered to pick up my stuff .
why were you talking about me ?
ke wondered why we broke up .
i had to tell him .
what did you say ?
i told him why .
told him about it .
how things were .
shouldn' t i have ?
you had no right to do that .
sure i did .
we have decided to share everything in our relationship .
what ?
is he outside ?
yes .
he didn' t want me to come up here alone .
we decided he could honk and i would wave if everything was ok .
was he worried i would hurt you ?
i could never hurt you .
i only wanted what was best for us .
ingrid ?

excuse me .
could you do me a favor ?
what did you have in mind ?
i live over here , and have something heavy i need moved .
i can' t do it myself .
no problem .
i' il be over shortly .
can' t you come right now ?
do you have anything else to do ?
no , i just thought ...
my name is anne .
john .
i know .
excuse me for disappearing .
i had to take care of something .
what are those doing there ?
don' t you have it like that ?
no .
different strokes for different folks , i guess .
do you mind ?
no , of course not .
i need this cabinet moved over there .
you can do it .
you sure are strong , to be able to move that .
i hope it' s worth it .
i don' t understand .
i' m kim .
john , your neighbor .
i know .
it goes in front of the door .
but i have to get out .
i forgot .
i' il do it afterward .
come and have a drink .
i think i' il just head home .
are you so busy you don' t have time for a glass of wine ?
have a seat .
that wasn' t so hard , was it ?
excuse me .
don' t you wonder why we want that cabinet in front of the door ?
different strokes for different folks .
that was just something i said .
i don' t think people are different at all .
what do you think , kim ?
people are pretty much the same , or totally different .
see ?
go ahead and ask .
ok .
why do you do it ?
why put a cabinet in front of the door ?
why do you think ?
i don' t know .
why do you think two women , two attractive women .
have to put a heavy cabinet in front of their door ?
is that so hard to understand ?
no , not at all .
who are they protecting themselves against ?
a man ?
not bad .
what does this man want ?
to get in .
excellent .
why does he want to get in ?
because he is attracted to one of them .
or both .
do you find it strange that he is attracted to them ?
no .
do you think it' s mutual ?
no .
what do you think , kim ?
not bad .
no , not bad at all .
some more wine ?
no , thanks .
i think i' il head home .
and do what ?
you don' t have anything to do there since your girlfriend ran off .
what do you mean ?
what do you know about that ?
your apartment is next door .
we can' t avoid hearing what goes on in there .
you' ve been listening ?
of course not .
why would that interest us ?
calm down .
it wasn' t our fault that she left you .
she wasn' t right for you .
it was embarrassing to see you together .
you talked to her ?
why would we do that ?
how could you know this otherwise ?
that' s what it' s like to live next door .
john ?
john ?
could you do me one more favor ?
no .
i need to pick up some medicine and can' t leave my sister alone .
this isn' t my problem .
she was assaulted .
she was assaulted .
out here .
by the man who lived in your apartment before you .
the man who lived here ?
he jumped her and dragged her into his apartment .
he did terrible things to her .
didn' t let her go until the next day .
since then she hasn' t dared go out .
what happened to him ?
we pressed charges , but no one believed her .
he wasn' t arrested ?
he just disappeared .
no one knows what became of him .
that' s why she doesn' t dare go anywhere .
is that why you have so many things ...
kim wants to be prepared in case we have to isolate ourselves .
can' t you stay with her for ten minutes while i run to the pharmacy ?
lock the door and put the cabinet in front of it .
is that really necessary ?
she' il panic if she sees it' s not there .
we don' t want that , do we ?
go on in .
i' il be back shortly .
the cabinet .
i thought you had left .
your sister had to ...
what sister ?
anne .
she isn' t my sister .
she said she was .
why would she bother lying about something like that ?
did she lie about anything else ?
say anything about me ?
she told me about what happened .
what ?
about that terrible assault .
and that you ...
did she say that ?
that i had been assaulted ?
that' s a new one .
and you believed her ?
why would she lie about that ?
do i look like i' ve been assaulted ?
i don' t know if you can see that .
that wasn' t what i asked .
do i look like someone who has been assaulted ?
where are you going ?
wait !
stop it !
do you like my room ?
give me the key !
have you been here before ?
what ?
of course not !
you have .
you just don' t recognize it .
bring me the key now .
i don' t want to be here .
are you angry at me ?
you are .
then i don' t want to talk to you .
hello ?
kim ?
kim !
kim , i' m not angry .
i' m not angry .
were you very sad when your girlfriend left ?
yes .
how sad ?
so sad that you no longer wanted to live ?
i heard she cheated on you .
wasn' t that horrible , when you realized she ...
did you ever think she would leave you ?
i wish i could meet a man as certain as you .
there' s a chair to the right of the door .
on the seat you' il find the key to the door at the end of the room .
anne had another line installed .
pretty smart , huh ?
so you can call from room to room .
real smart .
you like it ?
this is where i live .
that' s not true .
can you let me out now ?
so soon ?
we' re finally getting to know each other .
i have no business here .
i have no business here .
i' m not letting you out when you' re this angry .
i' m not angry .
i' m not angry !
what do you want ?
i want to talk .
have a seat .
sit down .
do you think i have had many men ?
i have no idea .
what do you think ?
anne was once with two men on the same night .
do you think that' s possible ?
probably .
it was in greece , or somewhere like that .
would it turn you on to be with a woman who had just had sex ?
i don' t think so .
why are you lying ?
you think it would be a turn on .
let me tell you a story first , then i' il let you out .
what kind of a story ?
you' il hear .
i' m about to start .
close your eyes .
why ?
i want you to picture it .
one day , about a month ago , there was a knock at the door .
i opened it .
there were three men
in plumber' s garb ...
what are they called ?
overalls .
they look at me , then come into the hall .
i' m hardly wearing anything .
i had just come from the shower .
they look at me .
i can tell they are horny .
i say , " why don' t we sit down on the couch first ?
we sit down .
suddenly the one who' s sitting next to me
sticks his hand between my legs
and starts caressing me .
the other one pulls down his pants and stands in front of me .
i take him in my mouth
and start blowing him .
then the third man comes up and bends me over the couch .
he bends me over and forces his way in from behind .
suddenly i feel the other one come in my mouth .
it runs down my throat .
then they take me one at a time .
it hurts a little , but i soon get used to it .
did you like my story ?
didn' t you ?
i was just kidding .
do you think i did that ?
i just read it somewhere .
come sit over here .
come over here .
what are you doing ?
that' s enough !
stop !
touch me .
do that again .
hi there .
hi .
how' s it going ?
fine .
what' s happened to you ?
nothing .
your face is bruised .
i bumped myself moving a cabinet .
are you refurnishing ?
looks like you got a beating .
who would do that ?
i have no idea .
if there' s anything you want to talk about ...
thanks for your concern .
those are not coming in here !
look how much we already have !
i can take them .
no , you can' t .
you aren' t even well !
now you' il be stuck here until the wee hours .
it' s no problem .
you always say yes .
that was probably your problem with ingrid .
don' t mention ingrid .
could you look up a number for me ?
36 swartzdorf street , 5th floor .
yes , that is my number .
don' t you have any other numbers on the 5th floor ?
how about unlisted numbers ?
no ?
hi , you have called ingrid .
please leave a message .
hi , it' s john .
i was just wondering how you were doing .
i' m ... much better now .
i feel much better now .
i was wondering
if we could get together for coffee , or something ?
have a talk .
i' m sorry
about what happened last time .
i behaved like an idiot .
anyway ...
what else did you tell him ?
this and that .
like what ?
stuff .
what kind of stuff ?
stuff that happened .
like what ?
that was an accident .
was it ?
did you tell him i did that on purpose ?
we agreed that it was an accident .
i thought so at the time .
now , i' m not so sure .
it slipped out of my hand !
you poured hot coffee over my arm .
you can' t go around telling lies like that about me !
ke made me realize it wasn' t an accident .
he wasn' t even there !
he asked what we did afterward .
i took you to the emergency room .
the emergency room ?
isn' t that what i did ?
we had sex .
for the first time in six months .
it turned you on .
remember ?
that had nothing to do with it .
ke thought that sounded sick , to get turned on by burning me .
you know what i think is sick ?
this ke person who asks his girlfriend
about who she has had sex with , and when and how .
ke thinks it' s important that we tell each other everything .
is he outside ?
yes .
was he worried i would hurt you ?
i could never hurt you .
i only wanted what was best for us .
ingrid ?
what has he done to you ?
you were never like this before .
i wasn' t myself before .
now i am .
ingrid ...
i told him everything .
how i had to make up crazy stories to turn you on .
but that isn' t true .
isn' t it ?
you got turned on when i told you i had sex with other men .
please stop .
no !
maybe you want to hear it again ?
how three men were standing outside the door .
how they took me on the couch .
is that the story you want me to tell ?
how a man comes in and starts fucking me from behind .
how he comes inside me .
oh , john , i' m so horny ...
john , i' m so horny ...
who is it ?
john .
your neighbor .
what do you want ?
i just want to talk .
i' ve had a pretty lousy day .
me too .
what did you want to talk about ?
i was wondering why i' ve never heard a sound from in here .
we can be pretty quiet .
no one can be that quiet .
what do you do in here ?
we' re waiting .
for that mystery man who supposedly is going to break in ?
you expect me to still believe that ?
why can' t we stop all this lying and sneaking around ?
never mind .
why are you so angry at ingrid ?
we heard everything .
through the wall .
what did you hear ?
we just had a little argument .
what' s so wrong with that ?
what are you going to do about it ?
i think she wants to talk to you .
anne ?
open the door .
stop kidding around .
hello ?
you know you aren' t allowed in there .
someone else is here .
i saw a man .
it' s just you and me .
the door is locked .
i saw someone .
it must have been anne .
why do you keep locking me in ?
why did you hit me yesterday ?
why did you hit me yesterday ?
kim , you started hitting ...
you didn' t have to hit back .
you' re stronger than me .
you could have just held my arms .
you' re right .
i could have .
please , not now .
do you think i have had many men ?
i have no idea .
she was once with two men on the same night .
think that' s possible ?
probably .
it wasn' t here .
she was on vacation .
in greece , or somewhere .
would it turn you on to be with a woman who had just had sex ?
would you find that exciting ?
i don' t think so .
who are you ?
i' m on my way out .
you' re john , aren' t you ?
i' m ke .
hasn' t ingrid told you that we ...
yes , she told me .
she has talked about you too .
what has she said ?
the usual .
it' s only natural to talk about your ex .
don' t you think so ?
she was worried about you .
are you doing better now ?
promise you' il tell me
if there' s anything i can do for you .
promise ?
are you angry ?
i can' t stand it when people are angry .
no .
no what ?
no , i' m not angry .
that' s good .
we should sit down for a real talk some time .
you could give me some tips .
about what ?
about what ingrid likes , of course .
so i can get to know her better .
do you want to leave ?
try this .
doesn' t it fit ?
ingrid told me about the coffee .
that wasn' t nice .
i' m not one to judge people , but ...
that' s inexcusable .
may i ask you a question ?
is ingrid that type ?
i' ve always considered her a careful woman .
haven' t you ?
i didn' t think she' d go for that kind of treatment .
but i got the impression it turned her on .
didn' t you too ?
you were wrong the whole time you were together .
she wasn' t the innocent little girl you thought .
i think she liked what you did .
she' s one of those .
she liked it , john .
it' s nothing to be ashamed of .
john , you' ve never experienced anything more intense .
isn' t that right ?
it' s nothing to be afraid of , john .
it' s too late .
you' ve already done it .
don' t you remember ?
don' t you remember ?
you asked us to take care of her for you .
that isn' t true !
you should love her , john .
you weren' t supposed to kill her .
i haven' t killed anyone !
go look .
she' s in there .
go look .
what' s going on ?
these are my things .
this is from work .
where did you get this ?
and this .
i got this from my sister .
please tell me what you have done !
why are my things in here ?
these are my things !
just go in .
she' s in there .
go on in .
hello ?
hello ?
hello ?
what have you done ?
john ?
are you there , john ?
go away .
it' s me .
peter .
peter who ?
peter reis .
what' s going on ?
what do you want ?
i need you to look at something .
what' s happened to you ?
are you sick ?
what has happened in there ?
what are you doing ?
don' t you have it like this ?
no .
different strokes for different folks , i guess .
what are you talking about ?
or else we' re all the same .
ingrid used to say that .
either we' re different , or we' re the same .
may i ask you something ?
you' re in the hallway right now , aren' t you ?
yes .
what do you see ?
a wall with a hole in it .
you don' t see the neighbors ' door ?
of course not .
you' re the only one up here .
can i come in ?
what are you doing in there ?
what' s that smell ?
john !
what' s going on ?
go away !
john !
john , i' m so horny ...
i should have left you ages ago !
i' il scream for ke if you don' t let me go .
go ahead .
ke !
ke !
ke !
help !
john ?
john ?
hi .
hi .
sleep ok ?
haven' t you slept ?
no .
what have you been doing ?
sitting there all night ?
are you still angry ?
angry ?
no , you don' t understand .
i' m not angry .
i' m just tired .
then come to bed .
you know that i would never hurt you in any way , right ?
of course .
i would never do anything to hurt you .
not deliberately .
of course i know you would never hurt me .
why do you say that ?
