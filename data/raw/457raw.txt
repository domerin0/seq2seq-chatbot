you cannot pass !
gandalf !
i' m the servant of the secret fire , wielder of the flame of anor .
go back to the shadow !
you shall not pass !
no !
no !
gandalf !
fly , you fools !
nooooooooo !
gandalf !
what is it mr. frodo ?
nothing .
just a dream .
mordor .
the one place in middle earth we don' t want to see any closer .
it' s the one place we are trying to get to .
it' s just where we cant get .
let' s face it mr. frodo .
we' re lost .
i don' t think gandalf meant for us to come this way .
he didn' t mean for a lot of things to happen , sam .
... but they did .
mr. frodo ?
it' s the ring isn' t it ?
it' s getting heavier .
what food have we got left ?
well , let me see .
oh yes , lovely
lembas bread !
and look !
more lembas bread .
i don' t usually hold to foreign food , but this elvish stuff is not bad .
nothing ever dampens your spirits , does it sam ?
those rainclouds might .
this looks strangely familiar .
that' s because we' ve been here before !
we are going in circles !
ah !
what' s that ' orrid stink ?
i' il warrant there' s a nasty bog nearby .
can you smell it ?
yes i can smell it .
we are not alone .
those thieves !
those filthy little thieves !
where is it ?
where is it ?
they stole it from us
my precious .
we hate them !
we hate them !
we want it !
this is sting .
you' ve seen it before ! haven' t you , gollum !
release him or i' il cut your throat !
it burns !
it burns us !
take it off !
quiet you !
it' s hopeless !
every orc in mordor will hear this racket !
let' s tie him up and leave him !
no !
that will kill us , kill us !
it' s nothing more than you deserve !
maybe he does deserve to die .
now that i' ve seen him , i do pity him .
we be very nice to hobbits , you be nice to us .
we swear to do what you wants .
we swear !
there is no promise you make that i can trust .
we swear ... ... to serve the master ... ... of the precious .
we swear on ... ... on the precious .
gollum , gollum .
the ring is treacherous .
it will hold you to your word .
yes ... ... on the precious .
on the preciouss .
i don' t believe you !
get down !
get down !
sam !
he was trying to trick us !
we let him go he' il throttle us into our sleep !
do you know the way to mordor ?
yes .
you' ve been there before ?
yes .
you will lead us to the black gate .
merry !
merry !
what is it ?
what do you smell ?
man flesh .
aragorn .
they' ve picked up our trail !
let' s go !
their pace quickens .
they must have caught our scent .
hurry !
come on gimli !
three day' s and night' s pursuit .
no food ... no rest and no sign of our quarry but what bare rock can tell .
not idly do the leaves of lorien fall .
they may yet be alive .
less than a day ahead of us , come !
come gimli !
we are gaining on them .
i' m wasted on cross country .
we dwarves are natural sprinters .
very dangerous we are over short distances .
rohan , home of the horse lords .
there' s something strange at work here .
some evil gives speed to these creatures .
sets it' s will against us .
legolas !
what does your elf eyes see ?
the orcs turn northeast .
they are taking the hobbits to isengard !
saruman .
the world is changing .
who now has the strength to stand against the armies of isengard ... and mordor ?
to stand against the might of sauron and saruman ... ... and the union of the two towers ?
together , lord sauron , ... we shall rule this middle earth .
the old world will burn in the fires of industry .
forests will fall .
a new order will rise .
we will drive the machinery of war with the sword ... ... and the spear and the iron fist of the orcs .
we now have only to remove those who oppose us .
the horsemen have taken your lands .
they drove your people into the hills to scratch the living of rocks .
murderers !
take back the lands they stole from you .
burn every village !
it will begin in the rohan .
too long have these peasants stood against you .
but no more .
othain !
othain !
take your sister .
you' il go faster with just two .
but papa says eothain must not ride .
he' s too big for him !
listen to me !
you must ride to edoras and raise the alarm
do you understand me ?
yes mum !
i don' t wanna go !
i don' t wanna go , mama !
freda , listen to me .
i will find you there .
quickly !
go , child !
rohan , my lord ... ... is ready to fall .
thodred !
your son is badly wounded , my lord .
he was ambushed by orcs .
if we don' t defend our country , saruman will take it by force .
that is a lie !
saruman the white has ever been our friend and ally .
grim .
grim .
grim .
orcs are roaming freely across our lands .
unchecked , unchallenged , killing at will .
orcs bearing the white hand of saruman .
why do you lay these troubles on an already troubled mind ?
can you not see ?
your uncle is weary of your malcontent . ... your warmongering .
warmongering ?
how long has it been since saruman bought you ?
what was the promised price , grim ?
when all the men are dead you would take a share of the treasure ?
too long have you watched my sister .
too long have you haunted her steps .
you see much , omer son of omund .
too much .
you are banished forthwith from the kingdom of rohan ... ... under pain of death .
keep breathing , that' s the key !
breathe !
ho !
they run as if the very whips of their masters were behind them .
we ain' t goin ' no further ... ... till we' ve had a breather .
get the fire going !
merry !
merry !
i think , we might have made a mistake leaving the shire , pippin .
what' s making that noise ?
it' s the trees .
what ?
you remember the old forest ?
on the borders of buckland ?
folks used to say that there was something in the water that made the trees tall ... ... and come alive .
alive ?
trees that could whisper ... ... talk to each other ... ... even move .
i' m starving .
we ain' t ' ad nothin ' but maggoty bread for three stinkin ' days !
yeah !
why can' t we have some meat ?
what about them ?
they' re flesh !
they are not for eating !
what about their legs ?
they don' t need those .
ooh !
they look tasty !
get back !
just a mouthful ?
no !
looks like meat' s back on the menu boys !
pippin !
let' s go !
go on , call for help .
squeal !
no one' s gonna save you now !
pippin !
a red sun rises .
blood has been spilled this night .
riders of rohan !
what news from the mark ?
what business does an elf , a man , and a dwarf have in the riddermark ?
speak quickly !
give me your name , horsemaster , and i shall give you mine .
i would cut off your head , dwarf ... ... if it stood but a little higher from the ground .
you would die before your stroke fell !
i' m aragorn , son of arathorn .
this is gimli , son of gloin and legolas from the woodland realm
we are friends of rohan and of thoden , your king .
thoden no longer recognizes friend from foe .
not even his own kin .
saruman has poisoned the mind of the king and claim lordship over this lands .
my company are those loyal to rohan .
and for that , we are banished .
the white wizard is cunning .
he walks here and there they say ... ... as an old man .
hooded and cloaked .
and everywhere his spies slip past our nets .
we are no spies .
we track a band of uruk hai westward across the plains .
they have taken two of our friends captive .
the uruks are destroyed .
we slaughtered them during the night .
but there were two hobbits .
do you see two hobbits with them ?
they will be small .
only children to your eyes .
we left none alive .
we piled the carcasses and burned them .
they' re dead ?
i am sorry .
hasufel !
arod !
may these horses bear you to better fortune than the former masters .
farewel .
look for your friends , but do not trust to hope .
it has forsaken these lands .
we ride north !
it' s one of their little belts .
we failed them .
a hobbit lay here and the other .
they crawled .
their hands were bound .
their bonds were cut .
they ran over here ...
... and were followed .
the belt !
run !
tracks lead away from the battle ...
... into ...
fangorn forest .
fangorn ?
what madness drew them there ?
did we lose him ?
i think we lost him .
i' m gonna rip off both your little heads !
come here !
trees !
climb a tree !
he' s gone .
merry !
let' s put a maggot hole in your belly .
run , merry !
little orcs !
it' s talking merry . the tree is talking .
tree ?
i am no tree !
i am an ent .
treeherder !
shepherd of the forest .
don' t talk to it merry .
don' t encourage it .
treebeard some call me .
and whose side are you on ?
side ?
i am on nobody' s side ... ... because nobody is on my side , little orc .
nobody cares for the woods anymore ..
we' re not orcs .
we' re hobbits !
hobbits ?
never heard of a hobbit before .
sounds like orc mischief to me !
they come with fire they come with axes .
biting , breaking , hacking , burning .
destroyers and usurpers curse them !
no !
you don' t understand .
we are hobbits !
halflings !
shirefolk !
maybe you are ... ... and maybe you aren' t
the white wizard will know .
white wizard ?
saruman !
see , see !
we have led you out !
hurry , hurry !
very lucky we find you .
nice hobbit .
it' s a bog !
he' s led us into a swamp !
swamp , yes , yes !
come master .
we will take you to safe paths , through the mist .
come hobbits , come .
we move quickly !
i found it .
i did .
the way through the marshes .
orcs don' t use it .
orcs don' t know it
they go round for miles and miles .
come quickly .
swift and quick like shadows we must be .
there are dead things !
dead faces in the water !
all dead .
all rotten .
elves and men and orcs .
a great battle long ago .
the dead marshes .
yes , yes !
that is the name .
this way .
don' t follow the lights .
careful now !
or hobbits go down to join the dead ones ... ... and light little candles of their own .
frodo !
gollum ?
don' t follow the lights !
gollum !
mr. frodo !
are you alright ?
so bright , so beautiful .
ah precious .
what did you say ?
master should be resting .
master need to keep up his strength .
who are you ?
musn' t ask us it' s name not his business .
gollum , gollum .
gandalf told me you were one of the river folk .
call me heart and hand and bone .
and call every traveller far from home .
he said your life was was a sad story .
they do not see what lies ahead when sun has faded and moon is dead .
you were not so very different from a hobbit once ... ... were you ?
smagol ?
what did you call me ?
that was your name once , wasn' t it ?
a long time ago .
my ...
my name
smagol .
black riders !
hide !
hide !
hide !
come on frodo , come on !
they will see us !
they will see us
i thought they were dead !
dead ?
no , you cannot kill them .
no .
wraiths !
wraiths on wings !
they are calling for it
they are calling for the precious .
mr. frodo !
it' s alright .
i' m here .
hurry , hobbits !
the black gate is very close .
orc blood !
these are strange tracks .
the air is so close here .
this forest is old .
very old .
full of memories ...
... and anger .
the trees are speaking to each other .
gimli !
lower your axe .
aragorn , something is out there !
what do you see ?
the white wizard approaches .
do not let him speak .
he will out a spell on us !
we must be quick .
you are tracking the footsteps of two young hobbits .
where are they ?
they passed this way the day before yesterday .
they met someone they did not expect .
does that comfort you ?
who are you ?
show yourself !
it cannot be !
you fell !
through fire .... ... and water .
from the lowest dungeon to the highest peak ... ... i fought him , the balrog of morgoth .
until at last , i threw down my enemy ... ... and smote his ruin upon the mountainside .
darkness took me .... ... and i strayed out of thought and time .
stars wheeled overhead ... ... and every day was as long as a life age of the earth .
but it was not the end .
i felt life in me again .
i' ve been sent back ... ... until my task is done .
gandalf !
gandalf ?
oh yes .
that was what they used to call me .
gandalf the grey .
that was my name .
gandalf !
i am gandalf the white now .
and i come back to you now ... ... at the turn of the tide .
one stage of the journey is over , another begins .
war has come to rohan .
we must ride to edoras with all speed .
that is one of the mearas ... ... unless my eyes are cheated by some spell .
shadowfax
he' s the lord of all horses ... ... and he' s been my friend through many dangers .
my home .
i sleep in the forest here .
the roots of the mountains .
i told gandalf i would keep you safe .
and safe is where i' il keep you .
the trees have gone wild and dangerous .
anger is in their hearts .
they will harm you if they can .
there are too few of us now .
too few of us that are left to manage them .
the black gate of mordor .
my old gaffer would have a thing or two to say if he saw this .
master says show him the way into mordor .
so good smagol does what master says so .
i did .
we cannot get past them .
look !
the gate , it' s opening !
i can see a way down .
sam !
no !
master !
i do not ask you to come with me , sam .
i know , mr. frodo .
i doubt these elvish cloaks will help us in there .
now !
no !
no !
no master !
they catch you !
they catch you .
don' t take it to him .
he wants the precious .
always he' s looking for it !
and the preciousss is wanting to go back to him .
but we musn' t let him have it .
no !
there is another way .
more secret and dark way .
why haven' t you spoke of this before ?
because master did not ask !
he is up to something .
are you saying is another way into mordor ?
yes .
there is a path ... ... and some stairs .
and then ... ... a tunnel .
he has led us this far , sam .
mr. frodo , no !
he' s been true to his word .
no !
lead the way , smagol .
good smagol always help .
edoras and the golden hall of meduseld
here lives the king of rohan ... whose mind is overthrown ... and saruman' s hold over king thoden is now very strong .
my lord , your son ... ... is dead
my lord ?
uncle ?
will you not go to him ?
will you do nothing ?
be careful what you say .
do not look for welcome here .
he must have died sometime in the night .
what a tragedy for the king ... ... to lose his only son and heir .
i understand his passing is hard to accept . especially now that your brother has deserted you .
leave me alone , you snake !
oh , but you are alone .
who knows what you have spoken to the darkness .
the bitter watches of the night ... ... when all your life seems to shrink .
the walls of your bower closing in about you
so fair .
so cold .
like a morning pale spring ... ... still clinging to winter' s chill .
your words are poison .
this place is as cheerful as a graveyard .
i cannot allow you before thoden king so armed , gandalf grayhame .
by order of grima wormtongue .
your staff .
oh .
no , you would not part an old man from his walking stick ?
my lord .
gandalf the grey is coming .
a herald of woe .
the courtesy of your hall is somewhat lessened of late ... ... thoden king .
he is not welcome .
why should i welcome you ... ... gandalf , gandalf stormcrow ?
a just question my lord .
late is the hour ... ... in which this conjurer chooses to appear .
lathspell spell i name him .
ill news is an ill guest .
be silent !
keep your forked tongue behind your teeth .
i have not pass trough dead to bandy a few words ... ... with a witless worm .
your staff .
i told you to take the wizard' s staff !
thoden ... ... son of thengel ... ... too long have you sat in the shadows .
i would stay still , if i were you !
talk to me !
i will release you ... ... from the spell .
you have no powers here ... ... gandalf the grey
i shall draw you , saruman , as poison is drawn from a wound .
wait .
if i go , thoden dies .
you did not kill me ... ... you will not kill him .
rohan is mine !
