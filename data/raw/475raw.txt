show me some proof .
there' s the proof .
hello , it' s me .
anything on mizoguchi ?
i see .
no , it' s fine .
one more thing .
something else i need to know .
if there' s any news in the aerospace industry , especially this week , tell me .
keep an eye on it .
thanks a lot .
let' s go .
it' s late .
let' s wait ' til tomorrow .
there' s no time .
what are you doing ?
wash your hands and sit .
what' s that ?
eat !
why the tears ?
it' s good .
i said it' s good jerk .
it' s pretty tasty .
that' s ' al dente ' .
' ai dente ' ?
it' s tricky to get right .
the national institute of space science
are you the one that called us ?
yes .
that old bastard has spies everywhere .
even in a place like this .
this way .
now you believe me ?
guess i have to .
but is it worth anything ?
i guarantee it .
it' s packed with incredible technology .
the old man sure knows his stuff .
right .
there' s something else .
something even better .
proceed , dr. yagi .
what the hell ?
you came to invade us ?
little monster .
look , it' s crying .
yes ?
what ?
it just started to move !
put that fire out !
contact the assault team .
we' il come back for this .
watch out !
what do you see ?
what' s out there ?
idiot .
it' s obvious .
what i' ve always wanted .
that thing is real power .
what are you doing ?
you scared me .
what are you doing with my coat ?
it fell so i picked it up .
fell ?
that' s right .
whatever .
what are you looking at ?
nothing .
give me a break .
october 21 , 2002
why didn' t you wake me ? !
you got up .
messed with my coat .
what ?
man found shot on street
many strange events reported worldwide .
the newsreader suddenly said
give me back the gate
the same phenomenon also occurred during ...
any information ?
step aside .
take a look at this .
a composite ?
it' s well done .
you think it' s a warning ?
from the triads ?
not their style .
they' d just shoot you dead .
any news ?
some good stuff .
what ?
first things first .
pay your dues .
didn' t your parents teach you that ?
so ?
a bizarre explosion last night .
where ?
the national institute of space science .
a research center north of here .
they turned away the fire department .
not a big deal by itself , but simultaneously , another explosion here .
six miles away , a mountain blew up .
it sounds fishy , right ?
i hired a guy to find out more and he sent me this picture .
that tree is here .
something went like this .
here' s a plan of the institute .
that' s where it is .
let' s go .
come on !
sure , but not dressed like that .
look at this .
take anything you like .
anything ?
don' t get carried away .
it' s disguise .
fantastic !
i even got a facial !
i' il go get changed .
do i look weird ?
not at all .
it' s so short .
my legs feel cold .
you love it .
no , i don' t .
okay , he' il do .
they' re my guests .
it' s that way .
sorry , mister .
i knew it' d be here .
hold on !
is that the space ship ?
right .
so that stuff about the alien .
now you believe me ?
hang on .
you' re really from the future ?
what' s that ?
they found us .
we' d better move .
i' ve got to be strong .
i must kill it .
what now ?
is this it ?
what do we do ?
here goes .
quick !
don' t just stand there !
this isn' t it .
this creature isn' t daggra .
what ?
something' s wrong .
this can' t be it !
isn' t this what you' re here for ?
i don' t know , the others looked different .
what do we do ?
quick , before we get caught .
what' s wrong ?
i want to go home
what ?
not me .
it was him .
is he contacting outer space ?
what the hell was that ?
he' s dying .
mizoguchi .
i should' ve guessed .
that punk from the other night ?
shut up .
you' re a dead man .
what do you have against me ?
remember a day in february , 15 years ago ?
no , i don' t .
you kidnapped my friend .
you were one of those kids ?
escape with that thing .
who' s that ?
forget it .
use that watch thing .
this ?
of course !
i' ve only got one .
i' il be okay .
wait in the car .
attack !
i said , " attack " !
who the hell is he ?
take that .
flatten the whole place !
all of it ?
all of it !
we' re clear .
detonate .
roger .
head downtown !
that old lady must know him .
if she plays dumb , hurt her .
yes , sir .
we hand it over tonight .
the boss himself is coming .
unstable chemicals are thought to have caused the blast .
many bodies are charred beyond recognition .
are you all right ?
what happened ?
he let me escape then it blew up .
i just saw on tv .
stay there , buddy !
miyamoto .
you did this ?
i' ve been in combat .
so it was all true .
just tell me what you' re up to .
now i know how you feel .
it must' ve been hard to talk about .
i see .
but it' s not easy to swallow .
what was that creature , then ?
i don' t know .
maybe i should' ve killed him .
did i mess up ?
what did he make you say ?
i want to go home
that' s it .
wait a minute .
i heard something similar .
was it on the news ?
yes , that' s right .
newsreaders everywhere , speaking odd .
now you , too .
what did they say ?
i' m trying to remember .
give me back the gate " ?
give me back the gate
the mothership' s come back , right ?
demanding his return .
the little one wants to go home .
just like a lost kid .
they didn' t let him , so his people got mad .
could it be right ?
we heard that the little one summoned the mothership to invade earth .
it' s a good cover up .
humans are good at lying .
especially guilty ones .
they' d soon shift the blame to the alien .
the war was caused by
us humans .
if that' s the case , you two are in deep trouble .
it' s mizoguchi .
he' s trying to kidnap it
what ?
it makes perfect sense .
he' s a dead man .
what do you mean ?
mizoguchi kills the daggra and starts a war .
it' s okay .
we' ve got ' til tomorrow , right ?
find out where he' s going .
it' il cost you .
whatever you want .
they' re here .
go out the back .
take the bike .
i' il see you later .
you believed me ?
in my job , i only trust people' s eyes .
get going .
she' s late .
what' s that ?
it was my brother' s .
are you regretting this ?
it' s not like i had any choice .
i grew up on the street of the mainland .
on the street ?
right .
nowhere else to go .
i had a best friend , called xi huan .
we grew up together .
causing mischief , thieving , fighting .
one day , i came back to find all my friends rounded up .
i was too scared to help .
it was mizoguchi .
he gutted them , sold their organs .
xi huan was one of them .
i' ve been after mizoguchi ever since .
killing him is all i care about .
now i guess we' re in the same boat .
i' m hungry .
let' s eat " al dente " .
that' s the method .
you mean , " spaghetti " .
how come it didn' t explode ?
oh , that .
a free sample from a drug store .
magnetic therapy
magnetic therapy ?
dumb kid !
how dare you ?
how did you smash the bottle ?
oh , that .
watch my gun .
no way .
you' re late .
not even " thank you " ?
i' ve been hard at work .
they' re meeting on an oil rig , some time before sunrise .
which is 5 : 42am .
here' s some gear .
enough ?
why so generous , all of a sudden ?
strike while the iron' s hot .
i see .
get going .
they' re behind me .
in front of my store , too .
can we make it ?
don' t worry .
i left a gift in their car .
you' il be fine .
come see me when it' s over .
thank you .
bitch !
behind us !
i thought she took care of them ?
hold on tight !
what did you do ?
nothing .
can i really alter the future ?
it' s a bit late to worry about that .
but what if we die ?
don' t worry .
we' il get mizoguchi first .
and get daggra home to his friends .
there' s plenty of time ' till sunrise .
you' re right .
we' il be fine .
but if we succeed , then what ?
what do you mean ?
if we prevent the war will i be sent back to the future ?
i guess so .
i see .
i' m the one to feel sorry for .
i work my butt off for no money if it goes well , my client disappears .
you don' t know that .
you will , i know .
don' t say that .
i' il come rescue you , some day .
i' il return the favor .
promises , promises .
i look forward to it .
i' il return .
i promise .
october 22 , 2002
what' s wrong ?
why are you like this ?
what' s this worth to you ?
are you in your right mind ?
i didn' t come here to negotiate .
and when you address me you will speak chinese !
i have a proposition , old man .
in return for what you want how about i get control of japan ?
i don' t understand .
this isn' t like you .
acting all tough .
i' il be nice and pretend i didn' t hear .
okay , i' il keep it for myself .
i see .
that' s a pity .
what' s the meaning of this ?
you think you can get away with it ?
my people from china will come for you .
i' ve already considered that and i feel untouchable , right now .
i wanted to tell you how i hated
speaking chinese .
only two hours ' til sunrise .
intruders .
what ?
who' s that kid ?
two bogies heading to you lead them to bay 6 .
where' s the cargo bay ?
down the hall on the right .
i' ve got a question .
on my signal , run .
why do you want that creature ?
or do you know something i don' t ?
check this out .
now !
go , i' il cover you .
got it .
where are you , milly ?
damn .
your best friend fetched a good price .
thanks to you .

mr. mizoguchi
what do we do next ?
hey , street kid .
come on out .
let' s talk .
i said " come out " , didn' t i ?
next time , in her head .
5, 4 , ...
miyamoto !
the rest is up to you , buddy !
3 , ...
stay there , buddy !
2, 1
milly , duck !
miyamoto !
what is it ?
what' s wrong ?
it' s no good .
it' s weaker by the minute .
not long left .
did you get it to talk ?
that' s what you' re here for .
hey , ugly !
how do your weapons work ?
say something .
that' s not going to help .
please be quiet .
any changes on the space ship ?
if we can' t use the weapons , it' s just junk .
it' s over .
if he dies , it' s all over .
who are you , anyway ?
how come you know about this ?
tell me everything .
he' s going to die .
then the war begins .
war ?
he' s got to return to the mountain .
back to his own kind .
war , huh ?
sounds like fun and profit .
but i' il save him .
all by yourself ?
you really messed up .
now he knows where to find this .
what do you mean ?
you misjudged my buddy .
who' s she calling " buddy " ?
what' s going on ?
i can see the bullets .
let' s take the chopper .
with the pilot .
stay where you are .
a slow death for you .
move .
keep moving .
milly !
where are you ?
no idea .
head upstairs !
the heliport' s on the roof
okay .
got it ?
there' s no exit .
keep looking .
sunrise .
damn .
he' s going to die .
it' s no use .
we' il never make it .
i knew i' d never change the future .
dumb kid !
it' s no time to cry .
it' s my fault .
i' m useless .
what was the point , miyamoto ?
i wanted to help you .
listen , you dumb kid .
you were amazing .
getting this far , all by yourself .
you can make it .
i know .
don' t give up yet !
i' m with you .
damn .
milly !
miyamoto !
we can make it by chopper .
so close , yet so far .
i hope it' s well built .
what are you mumbling ?
who are you calling now ?
the cavalry .
that hurt .
don' t move .
you messed up everything .
but now you die .
goodbye , sewer kid .
what was that ?
daggra , i guess ?
a disguised spaceship ?
it' s over .
i guess so .
no war then , i hope .
i' m sure .
i wonder if xi huan' s forgiven me .
he' s grateful .
what do i do now ?
need an assistant ?
i' m smart , useful .
i can even learn to cook .
i' m starving .
let' s eat " al dente " .
i told you that' s not ...
you said that on purpose , right ?
dumb kid .
miyamoto !

i' m sorry .
it sucks .
you' re sorry ?
you really have to go ?
miyamoto !
thank you
wait a second .

what' il you do ?
i' ve got to look for something new .
watch out .
you made a lot of enemies .
i know .

i' ve established contact with the target and was not found .
i' m going to return .
dumb kid .
