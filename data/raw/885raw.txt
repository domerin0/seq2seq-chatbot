oh , this is sixth sense .
i' ve never seen this .
bruce willis is dead .
what ?
bruce willis , he' s a ghost .
why would you tell me that ?
i don' t know .
makes me feel good .
thanks a lot .
oh , million dollar baby .
yeah .
you seen it ?
no .
she dies .
what ?
she breaks her neck and she dies .
you' re a mean little dude .
gentlemen , i am proud to announce that my comrade and i have reclaimed the high score in hell hunters .
that' s probably ' cause you' re the only ones at the bar who still play that game .
so there we are , face to face with a brain thirsty mob of zombies .
it looks hopeless .
that' s when i spot the zombie fuel truck .
but before i take aim
i blast it .
and it blows up .
it' s like we' re one mind with two bodies .
neither of which will ever get laid .
hey , thanks for that break , jason , i needed it .
seems like all i' ve been doing lately is working on russ thompson' s campaign .
who' s russ thompson ?
he' s the democrat running for manhattan borough president whose campaign i' ve been working on .
we' re going to his fundraiser tomorrow night .
i' m pretty sure we' ve been through this .
this may shock you , but i don' t listen to a lot of what you say .
i put a flyer on the bulletin board .
we have a bulletin board ?
you guys have to come support russ thompson , all right ?
we cannot let him lose to that republican douche bag jack clark .
look , i' m as big a democrat as the next guy who doesn' t vote .
but ...
i can' t go .
i gotta go do a recognize tomorrow night .
a " recognize " ?
what are you talking about ?
whenever my boss starts dating a new girl , he likes me to show up at the restaurant and pretend to recognize him .
makes the girl think he' s still famous .
glad to see your econ major' s paying off .
but , i mean , why are you still working for that lunatic ?
because that lunatic is my ticket to rock immortality .
the guy made rolling stone' s list of all time top record producers .
didn' t his last album totally tank ?
yeah , but what do you expect ?
it was the bachman turner overdrive without bachman or turner .
okay , so no barry .
bobby , you' re coming , right ?
no , because i' m not a democrat .
what are you ?
i' m an unregistered .
oh , please , you' il get hungry around 6 : 00 and beg me to come for the free food .
jason , i assume you' re in .
um , actually , i have a prior obligation .
what is it ?
it' s a personal thing .
uh oh .
someone has a date with an ugly chick .
what ?
aw , come on !
prior obligation .
personal thing .
what is it ?
is she hairy ?
i don' t have a date with a hairy girl .
n n n no , of course you don' t .
because she' s ... hairless ?
you guys , it' s a personal thing .
and it' s none of your business .
well , wait a minute .
i could put the hairy chick with no hair down as your plus one .
it' s about time .
she' il be here any minute .
i' m sorry .
okay , do you want the standard routine or the " i' m from the nobel prize selection committee " ?
now , just keep it simple .
okay , you stop me .
you beg me to take a photo .
i will generously allow it , demonstrating to my date that not only am i very famous , but magnanimous towards my fans .
quickly , here she comes .
oh !
whoo hoo hoo !
you look ravishing , kathy .
sherry .
very good .
waiter , a sherry for kathy .
oh !
what nick dresden , the big music producer !
oh , wow .
i don' t want to embarrass you , but you are , like , a rock god .
hey , do you think that maybe i could just get a photo with you ?
bugger off , you wanker !
so what' d you think of thompson ?
i thought he had some really good ideas .
like , those chunks of melon wrapped in ham ?
yeah , that' s why i' m voting for him .
so i just ran into jason and his date .
and ?
hairy or hairless ?
actually , neither .
pretty good lookin ' .
she does have a penis , though .
wait , what are you talkin ' about ?
jason was having dinner with a dude .
so what ?
so there .
and there .
and there .
whoa .
are they sharing a dessert ?
creme brulee .
wow .
no wonder he didn' t want to tell us where he was going tonight .
but wait , that doesn' t mean that he' s
look , i' m not saying that he' s definitely
no , we don' t have any concrete evidence that he' s
yeah .
although ...
we' ve known all along !
i mean , think about it .
we saw the signs .
in eighth grade , when we all went to see jurassic park , who snuck in to sleepless in seattle ?
he used to design clothes for his g. i. joes .
yeah .
so , it' s official .
jason' s gay .
what do we do now ?
i think we have to tell him that we know .
i mean , why make him go on living a lie ?
i agree .
let' s make him feel really safe and comfortable .
i think i know how we can get him to open up .
we' il just tell him our stories .
what stories ?
you know , the gay stuff everyone does when they' re kids .
i think that' s a great idea .
yeah , yeah .
you go first .
yeah , and then i' il go .
i' il go last .
' cause i' m sure mine will be the gayest .
okay , um
you guys remember when we went to camp middlewood in 1989 ?
and i used to get the prickly heat on my legs .
and i always wore that shorty robe ?
yeah , your kimono .
so anyway , i' m coming back from the showers one time .
i' m in that robe .
and i got baby oil on my legs because of the prickly heat .
go on .
i i go into my cabin .
and , uh , there' s my bunkmate , sheldon dratch .
now , dratch used to always do this joke where he put his hand on your chair just before you sat down , and then he' d poke you in the butt .
right , right , right , yeah .
so i go to sit down .
dratch puts his finger under me .
all i got on is the shorty robe and the baby oil , you know ?
so , i mean , i sit down , and , well
bloop .
bloop ?
bloop ?
bloop .
so , uh , for how how long ?
oh , just , like , a second .
like , a couple seconds .
you know , actually , now that i think about it , it was really just an accident .
i mean , it' s not exactly a gay story
dude , you got dratched !
ha ha ha .
yeah , all right .
we' il see who' s laughing when you guys tell me your stories , huh ?
you guys don' t have any stories , do you ?
it' s 11 : 00 .
where is he ?
maybe mr. creme brulee invited him in for a casual gay encounter .
you wouldn' t think it would take so long .
i mean , there' s no foreplay , right ?
not that i know .
i don' t know !
shut up .
hey , guys .
hey , girl .
you' re lookin ' fierce .
can i get you a glass of chardonnay ?
then we can dish .
uh ...
i' m good .
uh , so ... how was your evening ?
it was fine .
did you , uh , satisfy your obligation ?
okay , what is going on with you guys ?
all right , all right .
look , i' m just gonna come out and say it .
we think that you' re hiding something from us .
and we know about the guy you had dinner with tonight .
how do you know about that ?
were you following me ?
no , no .
i just happened to be at the restaurant and i happened to see you two .
and he happened to take some pictures .
who i have dinner with is none of your business .
look , jase .
whatever it is , we' re cool with it .
all right , you don' t have to keep who you are a secret from us .
we' re your friends .
no matter what .
all right .
i guess i knew i' d have to tell you guys someday .
i kept it hidden for so long .
my parents don' t even know .
hey , it' s cool .
it' s cool , okay ?
you just let it out .
all right ?
just let that right out .
okay .
okay .
i' m ...
i' m ... a republican .
hoo !
wow .
what a relief !
just to get it out there .
that' s your secret ?
yep .
wow .
a gay republican .
what ?
i' m not gay .
why would you think that ?
well , you spend more on shampoo than i do on food .
and then tonight i catch you having a romantic dinner with a dude .
it wasn' t romantic .
he runs jack clark' s campaign for borough president .
i' m working with him .
you' re a republican ?
since when ?
i suspected back in middle school .
but it wasn' t till the ' 96 election that i knew for sure .
you were so in love with clinton .
but i just wasn' t feeling it .
at night i' d lock my door and download bob dole' s platform .
okay , i just threw up in my mouth a little right there .
man , it' s not that big a deal .
we' il just avoid talking about politics when jason' s in the room .
yeah , just like we avoid talking about spiders when bobby' s in the room .
dude , stop it !
right now !
i' m sorry , you can' t expect me to just accept this .
you' re right , i don' t .
that' s why i never told you .
so it' s better to lie to me all these years ?
who are you ?
don' t you think you' re blowing this a little out of proportion ?
it' s just politics .
it' s not just politics .
it' s about core beliefs .
and now , i' m finding out we stand for completely different things .
like what ?
like i care about compassion .
and taking care of people .
oh , and protecting the environment .
i' m for all those things .
i just don' t think a bloated government is the way to get to them .
listen to you !
bloated government " ?
and this is why i don' t vote .
so what are you saying ?
that if i' m a republican , we can' t be friends ?
i don' t know .
maybe .
oh , come on , ben .
after everything we' ve been through together , you' re gonna let this one little thing get between us ?
it' s not a little thing to me .
so .
barry' s got a funny camp story .
so you still mad at jason ?
i' m not mad at jason .
i' m mad at the selfish , hateful republican ideology that fills his cold , dead heart .
what are you doing ?
sending out campaign materials for russ thompson .
hello .
hello .
may i sit ?
free country .
no thanks to you .
stuffing envelopes ?
yes .
you too ?
yeah .
trying to get a thousand letters out by tomorrow .
i' m gonna get a thousand out today .
are you ?
uh huh .
good luck to you .
and to you .
ow !
ooh , paper cut ?
no .
ow !
cut your tongue ?
no .
guys !
guys , what' s the big deal ?
what' s the big deal ?
look , if he had his way , the rich wouldn' t pay taxes and alaska would become one giant gas station .
that is such a crock .
you can' t even argue your point without resorting to hyperbole .
ooh , big word from someone who wants to eliminate the department of education .
stop it !
if this is the way it' s gonna be around here ...
i may just have to get a job !
you know , nick , there are times i wish
i' d never responded to your ad in the village voice .
there are times i wish i' d never responded to certain ads in the village voice myself .
barry ?
who' s that ?
it' s a friend of mine .
do i have to remind you that this is a place of business ?
bobby , what are you doing here ?
we got a real problem at home .
jason and ben are at each other' s throats .
barry ?
is your friend here to ask my advice ?
yes , nick .
my friend is here to ask your advice .
allow him to enter .
and welcome to oz .
so ... flatmates having a bit of a row ?
they are .
your majesty .
let me tell you a little story , boys .
led zeppelin .
1975 .
it was the opening night of their physical graffiti tour in manchester .
robert plant was angry at jimmy page for hiding his show scarves yet again .
they both refused to play .
but luckily , i remembered they loved deep sea fishing .
so i hired them a boat .
put them on it .
and let them catch a marlin .
by showtime , they were right as rain .
so the point you' re making is that by getting them together to do something they loved , it reminded them of what their friendship is really about .
no .
the point i' m trying to make is , i know jimmy page and robert plant .
so here' s the deal .
you guys need to make up .
and one time led zeppelin caught this fish .
so we think you should play this game together .
as sound as your argument is , buddy , our issues run pretty deep .
and i don' t think playing a video game is gonna help .
just humor us , okay ?
all right , let' s get this over with .
fine .
there' s one over there .
got it .
no , heads up , 3 o' clock .
yeah , check .
oh , whoa , whoa .
here they come .
go , go , go , go .
nice shot !
good eyes .
it' s like they' re having make up sex .
see ?
guns aren' t always bad .
yeah , when you' re using them to shoot zombies .
or defending your home against an intruder .
or when you accidentally shoot your mailman .
hey , hey , hey .
eyes on the prize .
these zombies aren' t gonna kill themselves .
they' re also not gonna wait two weeks while i get a gun permit .
okay !
you know what ?
game over , all right ?
this isn' t gonna work .
thanks for trying .
that' s one thing we can agree on .
excuse me , i' m so
barry ?
yeah .
it' s me !
sheldon dratch from camp !
sheldon freakin ' dratch !
you have no idea how happy we are to see you .
hey , yes !
ben , jason , bobby .
wow !
this is so great .
gosh !
barry , what' s it been ?
15 years since i' ve seen you , huh ?
you have not changed a bit .
bloop !
but right , you know what ?
let' s all take a seat .
we' il catch up .
come on , barry , you sit next to me .
old times .
boom .
w w wait , you gotta show me how that works one more time , sheldon .
sure , sure .
you see , the natural oils in my finger bloop dissipate the foam .
so you just pop your finger right up in there ?
yep .
right up in there .
okay , guys , we' ve taken up enough of sheldon' s time .
i' m sure he' s someplace to be .
not really .
we don' t see a ring on this finger , huh ?
just hit the road , jackass .
same old barry .
all right , well , i guess it' s getting late .
i better scoot .
but listen , i just wanna say how great it is that the four of you have stayed so close for so long .
real quick , what' s your secret ?
well , we get along really well .
we have a lot of history .
i don' t know .
what do you guys think ?
i don' t know .
we' re ... kind of the brothers we never had .
yeah .
we know each other better than anyone else .
and we just i guess we just try not to let stuff get between us ... usually .
yeah .
yeah .
usually .
well , you' re a lucky bunch of guys .
i hope you realize that .
seriously , get out .
all right , i' m out .
boom , boom , boom .
great guys .
all right .
