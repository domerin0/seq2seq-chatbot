we' il look after it .

mr. fawlty take my hamster !
he crazy , he think is rat !
why didn' t you check ?
what ?
you mean he' s had it for a whole year , and you' ve only just found out ?
supposing the health inspector had seen it ?
i know .
he could have closed us down .
what are you going to do with it , basil ?
you can' t keep it in here .
i know .
and don' t let it loose in the garden .
it' il come back in the house .
can' t we get you on " mastermind " , sybil ?
next contestant , sybil fawlty from torquay , special subject , the bleedin ' obvious !
i wasn' t going to let it go in the garden .
what are you going to do with it ?
i don' t know .
i' il take it away .
let it go .
give it its freedom .
you can' t do that , basil .
he wouldn' t be able to defend himself .
he' s a rat , isn' t he ?
he' s domesticated , aren' t you ?
you' re domesticated , you do all right .
basil !
he won' t get mugged by a gang of field mice , will he ?
basil , he' s manuel' s pet .
we have a duty to it .
perhaps we could find a home for him .
all right !
i' il put an ad in the papers !
wanted ... kind home for enormous savage rodent .
answers to the name of sybil .
look , i' il take him out into the country ...
no !
i cannot abide cruelty to living creatures .
well , i' m a creature , you can abide it to me .
you' re not living .
look , manuel , we were just wondering ...
mrs. fawlty , please understand .
if he go , i go .
well , goodbye .
please listen .
you know , we really can' t keep him here .
the health inspector wouldn' t ...
mrs. fawlty , he here one year , he do no harm .
but , manuel , listen .
if they see your rat , they could close the hotel down .
perhaps it would be simplest to have him put to s l e e p .
who ?
him or the rat ?
we might get a discount if we had ' em both done . " spleep " ?
manuel , i' ve rung my friend .
it' s all right .
she' il take him .
she has lots of animals , and it' s not far from here , you can go see him whenever you want .
come on , we' il take him there now .
but he forget me !
rats are like that .
don' t get involved with them .
i think it' s the best solution , manuel .
oh , he' il be happy .
you' il see .
sad , isn' t it ?
well , look at it from the point of view of the rat .
what ?
would you want to spend the rest of your life with manuel waiting on you ?
we' ve been through the cupboards , you' re doing the walls ,
terry , the filters , checked the fridges ...
come here .
right , that' s done .
now , sybil , everything done here ?
have you put the lid on the tank , basil ?
that' s why i' ve been on the roof the last 40 minutes .
and you took the pigeons out ?
no , i left them in .
they' re nearly done .
now , walls ?
i' ve checked everything .
terry , the hoods .
we' ve done the cupboards ?
it' s all been done , basil .
the fridge .
have we got it all separate ?
basil , i told you , it' s all been done .
seals on the old fridge , the floor ?
i' ve checked it .
just running over the bleeding obvious , dear .
so , all is shipshape and bristol fashion , eh ?
all ready for old snoopy drawers ?
is this about that rodent ?
leave him alone , basil , he' s upset .
he' s not going to cheer up mooning about like that , is he ?
just let him be .
it doesn' t help him , you encouraging it .
you' ve got to get his mind off it .
well , manuel , what do you think ?
looks good , doesn' t it , eh ?
all clean and shining bright ?
so empty , without him .
yes , but those walls look good , too .
and the hoods , gleaming like that , isn' t that a marvelous sight ?
please leave me alone .
i get over it .
yes , no point in letting it get you down .
plenty more fish in the sea , eh ?
don' t !
what ?
don' t hit me .
always you hit me .
i' m not hitting you , i' m trying to cheer you up .
let him be , basil .
look , look ... don' t look at me with those awful cow eyes .
wh ... why don' t you go to the cinema tonight ?
why don' t you and polly go to the ice rink ?
why don' t you ... cheer up , for christ' s sake !
basil !
i can not stand this awful self indulgence !
leave him alone , basil , he' s just depressed .
manuel , my wife informs me that you' re depressed .
let me tell you something , depression is a very bad thing .
it' s like a virus .
if you don' t stamp on it , it spreads throughout the mind , and then one day , you wake up in the morning , and you can' t face life anymore .
and then you open a hotel .
we didn' t win the war by getting depressed , you know ?
manuel ! ? cmo ?
not so sad .
no ?
no , no .
it' s too much .
too much ?
much too much .
just a little bit sad .

why was he firing it in the hotel ?
shooting starlings .
in the bar ?
through the window .
i' il lock it away .

i ' aven' t , i ' aven' t !
polly say you put basil in ratatouille .
i haven' t made any bleeding ratatouille !

but , fawlty , how did the starling get in the bar ?
no , no , no .
you were in the bar .

manuel knocked ' em over .
we picked ' em all up .
oh , my god !
what' s the matter ?
one of them' s got rat poison on it .
sorry , sorry !
veal' s off , sorry .
that' s veal ?
no , no , this is ... veal substitute .
we' re giving it a try , and it' s a bit of a disappointment , i' m afraid .
in fact , it' s no substitute at all .
polly , would you take the order again , please ?
thank you , thank you so much .
i' m sorry about that .
would you like the lamb or the plaice ?
veal substitute ?
well , it' s japanese , actually , soya beans and essence of cow .
seals ?
we' ve moved all the meat into this one , and we' ve put the confectionery ...
ahem !
a bottle of the beaujolais , please .
certainly .
and the wash handbasin ?
we ordered it yesterday .
here' s the acknowledgement of the order .
well , it would appear that this kitchen is now in a satisfactory condition .
i shall be writing to confirm ...
sorry , it slipped . ... the outstanding points , and someone will be dropping in to carry out a future random inspection to make sure these standards are being maintained .
thank you .
marvelous .
it' s 10 to 1 : 00 .
i' d like to take lunch here , if i may ?
certainly , mr. carnegie .
i couldn' t help noticing you had some veal over here ...
veal ?
yes , it' s dutch .
it' s not dutch , actually .
it' s norwegian .
norwegian ?
yes .
not the absolute apex , quite honestly .
terry , the veal is dutch , isn' t it ?
norwegian , mrs. fawlty .
i' ve been in this business 20 years ,
i' ve never heard of norwegian veal .
they' ve only just branched into it .
i don' t think it' s a winner , frankly , more of a veal substitute .
it' s got a lot of air pockets in it , that sort of thing .
the lamb is dutch .
dutch ?
english , i mean .
we call it dutch ' cause it' s as good as the veal .
better , honestly .
i prefer the veal .
how about lobster ?
would you prefer lobster ?
a couple of lobsters ?
it' s frightfully good at the moment .
it' s not expensive this week .
we' ve got so much , we' re having a sale to try and shift it all .
75p each , two for 1 .
can' t say fairer than that .
just the veal .
if you like the veal ... perhaps you' d prefer the chicken ?
basil , he wants the veal .
could i make a phone call ?
yes , of course .
through here .
what' s all this about rat poison on the veal ?
he' s put rat poison on one , they' ve got mixed up , and nobody knows which is which now .
well , what happened to the one the cat ate ?
the cat ? !
that' s no good .
that might have poison on it too .
well , where is it ?
what ?
where' s the cat' s slice ?
up here .
right .
now , how' s the cat ?
how' s the cat ?
we' re about to take the life of a public health inspector and you want to know " how' s the cat ? " !
it' s gone to london to see the queen !
what are we going to do ?
he' s all right !
great !
hooray !
hooray !
the cat lives !
the cat lives !
long live the cat !
what are we going to do ? !
mr. fawlty , if the cat is all right , that means that slice is all right .
but how long would it take to work ?
that stuff ?
two minutes .
he had this 10 minutes ago at least .
it' s a bit chewed there .
i' il give it a trim .
you' re driving over to babbacombe this afternoon ?
yes , we' re ...
what is a plate of veal doing there ?
i' il just relieve you of it , shall i ?
do sit down , mr. carnegie .
he just has , basil .
on a plate of veal .
has it put you off ?
what ?
has it put you off the veal ?
at all ?
i' m not eating that one , if that' s what you mean .
stop !
halt !
sorry , i think there might be another one .
excuse me .
ah , yes .
lucky guess .
well , who' s responsible for putting them there ?
manuel , our spanish waiter .
thank you .
now , would you care to take a seat right here ?
please .
does he do it often ?
oh no , no .
it' s the first time .
sometimes looks as if he' s going to .
we always catch him , of course .
here' s your veal , mr. carnegie ,
and one green salad .
thank you .
ah , bon .
good appetit .
well done , terry .
sorry , not hot enough .
not big enough , sorry .
what ?
not big enough , sorry .
excuse me .
really , polly !
what are you doing ? !
well , if that' s the one , these are okay .
what ?
if that' s the poison one , these are all right .
brilliant !
great , right .
okay .
basil , what is going on ?
that was the poisoned one .
the cat had it .
the cat !
poisoned ?
yes , so that one ... must be okay , hmm ?
basil ...
sorry , just getting you a proper sized one .
it was big enough .
it was all i wanted .
well , it could have been a bit hotter .
well , not much , but ...
look ...
yes , yes .
it' s just coming .
won' t be a second .
manuel , would you ...
here .
what ?
look , he' s all right .
look !
he can' t be .
well , he is .
here ya are , poll .
oh .
he can' t be !
what do you mean ?
he was vomiting .
vomiting ?
that' s just fur balls , basil .
what ? !
that' s just fur balls .
he does that all the time in the summer .
but ... but if he' s all right , that one might ...
polly , polly !
too much .
what ?
too much .
too much of a good thing always leaves one wanting less , i always find .
ugh .
what' s wrong now ?
we wouldn' t want you to think that just because you were one of her majesty' s civil servants , we were showing you any excess favoritism .
i' m sure you wouldn' t want that .
oh !
so you' re the rat inspector !
sorry , fawlty !
starling inspector .
starling inspector ?
one for you .
thank you .
and one for you .
thank you .
do you mind ? ? qu ?
we' il have one windsor soup , one pat , please .
one windsor ...
shh !
if the cat' s slice is all right , that might be the poisoned one .
no , no .
yes , he' s right .
and if the cat' s one is all right ...
which it is ...
we can give him that , can' t we ?
right !
mr. fawlty ?
shut up !
but , terry , that' s got things on it .
that' s all right , mrs. fawlty .
what the eye don' t see , the chef gets away with .
mr. fawlty ?
what is it ? !
table seven !
what ?
basil !
sorry , it' s just coming .
excuse me .
of course ,
good afternoon , sir .
good afternoon , madam .
i was just trying to give an order to your waiter , and he walked away while i was doing it .
hmm ?
he wasn' t paying attention at all .
i' m so sorry .
what were you saying ?
the waiter wasn' t listening when i was giving him our order .
he seemed more interested in my fiance' s legs .
really ?
may i ?
i don' t think so .
in fact , i think there' s a bread roll down there .
may i give my order ?
oh , please .
of course .
