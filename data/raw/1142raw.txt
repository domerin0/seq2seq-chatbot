kaminsky !
gloves !
this woman is educational material , not a fellow student .
kaminsky , you old lecher .
why don' t you try it with live women ?
just when i finally found fresh meat ....
from tomorrow on , it' il be river corpses again .
professor ?
we found an anatomic anomaly in the abdominal area .
a penis , perhaps ?
that isn' t an anomaly .
men are different from you women .
may l ?
these things are slippery .
yes ?
paula henning , 783 points in the 1999 robert koch contest .
the second best score in the country .
congratulations !
does that mean that i' ve been accepted into heidelberg ?
yes . lf you prefer to spend your summer with corpses ... ... instead of with young men .
grombek' s course in anatomy is the very best .
a test of will .
really intensive .
fully focused .
i wanted to go to ltaly , but this is obviously
this is such a chance , with your talent !
and you want to go to ltaly for the summer ?
ln ltaly there' s a lot of fondling , too .
yes !
exactly .
good bye .
excuse me .
excuse me .
so ?
heidelberg !
hi , grandpa .
listen , your transaminase level is high ... ... and i just heard , that they' re considering hemofiltration .
they want to increase morphine to 5 ml , but they still have to ask schtzenberger .
does it hurt that much ?
paula , i' ve been dead since christmas .
they' re just torturing me with the machines ... ... that i myself bought as head physician .
your score in the robert koch contest ?
over 700 .
second best result in the country .
very good .
so ?
heidelberg .
i don' t want to leave you alone .
i don' t need a keener .
nothing could make me happier than to know ... ... that my paula will be a physician .
not someone who applies bandages or a hospital bureaucrat ... ... but a true physician .
my successor .
i' m so proud of you .
i have to go , grandpa .
bye .
would you pull the plug from the socket ?
heidelberg ?
those red spots are only crab lice .
don' t worry , nellie .
dad , this is the chance of a lifetime !
put some of that on it .
you could be happy for me at least once .
i thought you would help me in the practice .
that' s what you promised me , once .
the course in research with grombek i told you about ....
lf you pass , you can work in any research centre
ln any elegant private clinic .
the purpose of human suffering is to make doctors rich and famous .
i just want a top education
kevin has such a terrible cough .
nellie , don' t touch that !
i want a career , even if you think it' s stupid .
i don' t want to end up in such a ....
yes , go on .
at least take the blue one with you .
maybe you' il go out .
mom , i' m going to heidelberg for work .
taking a dress with you doesn' t mean ....
i' m not going to get pregnant and ruin my career .
thanks .
that' s really nice of you .
mom , i' m sorry .
i didn' t mean it .
did you apologise to dad ?
i really try , but hearing him say ... ... that successful people are criminals , just because he' s only a
even if dad can' t stand his father ... ... he should visit him at least once .
he' s really in bad shape .
will you write to me ?
mom , this is going to be great !
where am l ?
he' s awake .
are we ready for anaesthesia ?
circulation is fine .
2 mg promidal .
did you already take a look at the list ?
was there anything interesting ?
what are you doing ?
the person from berlin .
henning ?
paula or petra .
excellent grades .
a woman would be a novelty , for once .
we could get in touch with her .
when she arrives in heidelberg .
dlssectlng room
hey , we met in munich .
yes .
you were in the professor' s course , too .
the six handed anatomist , yes .
i feel uncomfortable when he ....
well , i just let him do it a little .
at least that way i avoid his second class courses .
he wouldn' t actually have the nerve to fondle your breasts .
are you going to heidelberg , too ?
yes .
why , " too " ?
let' s rent a room together .
i' il bet there are nice guys there ... ... even if they' re doctors .
but who knows ?
a doctor ! ls there a doctor here ?
he fell .
because of the heat .
hello ?
can you hear me ?
relax .
can you hear me ?
are you okay ?
can you hear me ?
do you feel all right ?
empty a compartment .
hurry !
you finally realise why you actually study all this shit .
that wasn' t a fainting spell .
it was cardiac arrest .
it' s called cardiomyopathy .
advanced heart insufficiency .
big heart , small valves .
besides falling down dead every now and then , it' s no trouble .
would you like my corpse ?
it' s a unique object for study .
before that , we' il have to test all your vital functions .
i' il meet the 435th specialist or miracle healer ... ... tonight in some pub .
they only get excited over rare illnesses .
i' m beyond help .
don' t talk that way .
modern medicine
here' s my number .
we practice medicine in pubs , discos or cinemas ... ... and if you need ....
well , thanks .
good luck .
the poor guy .
i didn' t know , that you could get that disease so young .
so you' re from munich , too ?
i' il put you both together in one apartment , okay ?
no alcoholic beverages , no pets .
male visitors are allowed .
you' il have to organise that on your own , though .
by the way , my name is philip .
i' m always phiril .
a play on words .
how sweet .
excuse me ?
cute .
hi , is anyone there ?
all anatomy students , to the dissecting room .
ln the new wing .
hurry !
the dissecting room is here , isn' t it ?
excuse me .
are you here for the introduction ?
we' re going to the anatomy course .
exactly .
i believe it' s over there .
great !
this looks cool .
maybe we' re too early .
my name is paula .
paula henning .
hi .
i' m gretchen .
gabi .
university of tbingen .
tbingen !
i had a really sweet boyfriend over there .
we' re both from munich , but we don' t belong together .
am i crazy or ....
i thought i saw movement or something .
that' s rather unlikely .
so , what was your boyfriend' s name ?
the one from tbingen ?
very funny .
scaring a couple of chicks !
a welcoming ritual in heidelberg ?
nonsense .
what cannot exist , doesn' t exist .
a corpse can' t move .
it' s a corpse , not a doll .
how does a body move ?
a contraction of muscles produced by nerve impulses .
and how do nerves function ?
electrical impulse .
an impulse can be induced .
nerves stimulated by electrical impulses produce muscular contractions .
that implies movement .
that is logical .
there is a scientific explanation for everything .
all you need is a high voltage cable .
that paralyses the whole network .
what are you doing ?
using a corpse as a toy train ?
no trace of ethics , you stupid assholes .
i' il get you sooner or later .
asshole !
those from heidelberg already have grombek the whole year .
hard , but unfair .
the perfect sadist .
he' s brilliant in his field , though .
who is your professor ?
i was with botticelli in berlin .
now i' m doing my alp at the sorbonne .
huber , munich .
kledermann , emden .
what ?
there' s no university in emden .
there' s a butcher shop .
my uncle is a butcher .
he slices like a god .
seriously .
there , you learn the difference between tripe and steak .
a difference of at least 30 dm .
but ...
... a doctor , i mean ....
meat is meat and has its price .
heart costs more than liver , liposuction less than breast surgery .
medicine is a service , and we all want to earn well , don' t we ?
i' m from heidelberg too .
really ?
specialised in anabolism .
but call me anyway , the next time you' re naked .
actually i' m a charming person .
i love bird calls and know the names of many flowers .
but i' m a doctor .
caspar .
paula henning .
your grandfather was dean here , right ?
basic neurological anatomy .
heidelberg ' 57 .
that' s a nice dimple .
has your date still not shown up ?
where' s the restroom ?
come with me .
i' il show you .
ln there .
drunks !
he has probably puked all over .
ciao bello .
bye .
his name' s hein and let me tell you he' s all muscle !
he takes himself so seriously .
today you got close to your sweetheart , too .
my what ?
the tall , dark one .
caspar .
it was so obvious that ....
oh god !
stop chattering about men .
you' re obsessed .
i' m here to work , not to fuck around .
that' s too bad .
do you know what time it is ?
ls he still unconscious ?
pay attention .
we make the incision here , alongside the arteries near the heart .
that way , we expose the heart laterally .
help ! ls anyone here ?
too bad .
he' s dead .
we can' t use him anymore .
lnjured ?
no .
just a scratch .
now what do we do with it ?
our highly modernised society tends to reduce everything ... ... to problems of the soul .
the doctor , who simply cuts away a disease , doesn' t count anymore .
i' m fond of saying that people prefer to die in one piece ... ... rather than be cured by traditional medicine .
here , in the new wing of the institute ... ... a most modern dissecting room is at your complete disposal .
no pain has been relieved yet in this room .
no patient has been cured .
we are laying the foundations for that here .
discoveries are being made ... ... which save the lives of people out there ... ... or at least make them easier to bear .
the basis of medicine .
ladies and gentlemen , we believe you are the best .
you are the elite , the future of our profession .
a third or even half of you won' t be with us anymore ... ... after we have given the results .
be grateful for this apparent inflexibility .
strict selection guarantees our high academic level ... ... and the reputation of this institution .
as you can see , heidelberg traditionally has a fine collection of specimens .
this collection is at the exclusive disposal of all scientists ... ... and students .
it is invaluable for science and education .
my god .
fantastic .
wow .
are these models ?
no , no .
these are real human specimens .
plastimised .
all fat and water has been extracted from the tissue .
they are preserved for eternity .
dr. e. henning
ewald henning .
that' s my grandpa .
colleague , we' re glad to know that your grandfather is so famous .
your achievements , however , must be your own .
lmmediately afterwards , you will receive your research topics .
you will hand in a paper on them at the end of the course .
ln addition , there will be mid term exams .
the first one in three weeks ... ... after which , the six least prepared students will go home .
the same will happen after the second mid term exam .
lectures will be held every day from 7 : 30 a . m . to 12 : 00 a . m .
the dissecting room , library and laboratory are at your disposal from 6 a . m . to 10 p . m .
evenings and weekends are to be used for studying .
david .
i think it' s 10 years since i last smoked a cigarette .
the last time during summer camp , secretly , beneath a blanket .
summer camp ?
do you want to know what i did there secretly ?
under a blanket ?
i didn' t like the taste then , either .
damn .
i could still see the signs of my cardiac massage on david' s chest .
wonderful .
can we plastimise the heart and circulatory system as specimens ?
now ?
their structure is no longer clearly defined .
once decomposition begins ....
you have an interesting acquaintance here .
take a look .
ln his condition , it' s a miracle he was alive , not to mention the aneurysm .
lnoperable .
would you like to remove the heart ?
lf it' s too much for you emotionally , as a woman ....
we save a human life and shortly afterwards it' s lost all the same .
we are doctors .
what are these stab wounds or cuts in the abdomen ?
only medical instruments are this sharp .
i guess they must have been caused by a clumsy dissector .
asshole .
i can' t believe that david died so quickly because of this tumour .
look at his neck , at the jugular vein .
the blood is like gum .
and what does that have to do with cardiomyopathy ?
absolutely nothing .
david was terminally ill .
you couldn' t have saved him .
you' re imagining things because of your guilt feelings .
we' re here to examine corpses , right ?
shall i open the skull ?
not yet .
thank you .
i must manage to examine him in the standard way ... ... otherwise i can forget about medicine .
i' il do an analysis .
professor ?
miss henning .
colleague .
come in .
wow , it' s fantastic here .
this is a central american papilio demoleus .
wonderful !
it' s so light , so lively .
about david , i just want to know that there was nothing i could have done .
your reactions were clear , correct , scientific .
ln my time we called this " composure .
lmpressive .
yes .
it seemed somehow strange that  we both know ... ... that you had personal motives .
emotions .
female intuition .
further involvement would be ... ... silly .
but  would you like some tea ?
otherwise mrs. erhardt will prepare a cup of coffee ... ... biscuits and a slice of pie .
we' re closing the case .
it doesn' t exist .
that' s why i' m calling , bernie .
i' ve never seen blood with such strange consistency .
the process must have begun before death .
there are no clots ?
no .
it' s more like ... ... gum .
was your friend greenish , rather small and with antennae on its head ?
why green ?
let' s be serious .
i' il send you a sample , and you check it in biochemistry .
a tissue sample ?
yes .
i' il try to get one for you .
bernie needs fresh meat .
liver , if possible .
what do i get for it ?
a kiss .
a french kiss and i get to fondle you .
on the forehead , and no fondling .
bye , little one .
bye , old man .
your father ?
yes , l  you seem to have a good relationship .
no , it was a friend .
not my boyfriend , my ....
damn .
purely scientific ?
i' m always ....
you think you' re really great , don' t you ?
i think you' re really great , too .
come here and take a look .
take a look .
this is the young man' s blood .
have you seen anything like this before ?
it has nothing to do with the tumour .
i have to go to the dissecting room .
what , now ?
to get some tissue samples .
after the weekend it would be too late for toxicology .
what did you actually want ?
well , cinema , ice cream parlour , dissecting intestines , something romantic .
okay . ln one hour down in the dormitory .
nonsense .
corpses look the same at night as during the day .
it' s just the university building .
what are you doing ?
i wanted
student ?
name ?
paula .
paula henning .
i just wanted ....
does the professor know ?
yes , of course .
he himself said that i should ....
david .
i mean , number seven ....
i need to know who sent him here .
i need to talk to the doctor in charge .
twenty two year old male .
cardiomyopathy .
yes , and who  that' s classified information .
i really must know who sent him here .
yes .
it' s me .
someone was just here .
crematorlum
i got a tissue sample .
something' s going on , i' il tell you !
i absolutely must find the doctor who sent david here .
the dissector has a list stating the origin of the corpses .
lf there were any way i could get that list ....
you' re a good kisser , but your sweater smells like formalin .
are you coming to the pond tomorrow ?
damned corpses !
i' m dead tired !
i took part in a contest and wrote the second best paper .
how did you get accepted here in heidelberg ?
i wrote the best paper .
ln the robert koch contest for the advanced semester ?
this year , i won for the third time .
do you think a man can still get it up ... ... when he finds out that my lq is 50 points higher than his is ?
but , i mean ....
why hein ?
we need something besides work .
and hein is great .
yes , come here !
what is it ?
turn around .
there .
latissimus .
beautifully defined .
the retro spina and here
gretchen .
stop it !
flex it .
glutaeus maximus .
great !
thank you , sweetie .
we always get these wrinkled , old guys in pathology .
lf someone is too intelligent one might fall in love .
but your caspar is well built too .
does he have anything in his pants ?
you know , he isn' t my  do you think they ever talk ... ... about anything else besides our breast size ?
it could be fun to discuss dick size in public .
caspar .
we were just talking about you and your friend .
friend ?
what friend ?
carrot or banana ?
have you heard of a hospital in heidelberg with the abbreviation aaa ?
with an exclamation point ?
how did you know that ?
there' s a medical association .
the anti hippocrates lodge .
where did you see it ?
on a corpse .
like the sign left by a brand .
it must have been something else .
the anti hippocrates lodge has been forbidden .
it doesn' t exist anymore .
it seems a bit kitsch here .
i mean , a pond at sunset in heidelberg , the birds chirping ....
kissing is in bad taste ?
you know what i mean .
ls it possible that it' s easier for you to fool around with dead men ... ... than with living men ?
ls that true or am i right ?
you idiot .
and ? ls he right ?
he' s an insolent fool .
and ? ls he right ?
he' s an insolent fool .
anyway , aaa is the abbreviation for age actabile antihippocrate .
do that which is possible ?
there' s nothing specific about its being a secret organisation .
it' s a mixture between a masonic lodge and a student fraternity ... ... with rituals , lodge and so on .
the point is , contrary to doctors who pledge themselves to hippocratic ideals ... ... helping , healing and so on ... ... they are completely devoted to scientific research .
here .
experimental killing of individuals to promote the survival of many . " lnsane .
founded in the 16th century .
last peak in activity during the third reich .
at present there have been isolated activities ...
... in genetic research , artificial insemination ...
... and pharmacology .
an anti hippocratic centre at the beginning of the century ...
... and during the nazi period was ...
... heidelberg .
and david ....
an ideal victim for forbidden experiments .
a young patient with a rare disease in its advanced stages , model development ....
so you mean that here , in heidelberg ... ... doctors are engaging in forbidden experiments ?
of course .
my diarrhoea .
god , diarrhoea like that must be anti hippocratic .
paula , really .
it itches .
i think i already have a brand on my butt .
what ?
promidal ?
that' s right .
promidal , exactly the way you pronounce it .
at first it was used by taxidermists .
it' s basically plasma proteic .
it practically plastimises tissue by extracting all the salt .
one injects it into a living animal and it is carried by the bloodstream into the cells .
put simply , once allowed to harden , you have your specimen .
it was forbidden by animal protection agencies .
the longer it' s active inside an animal , the thicker the blood becomes .
the animal' s movements become slower and sooner or later : bingo .
paula ?
are you still there ?
yeah .
lts chemical structure is amazingly simple .
the antidote is basically a simple saline solution .
the question is , how did it get into your friend' s blood ?
yeah , me too .
on your firm buttocks .
paula ?
yeah .
you pervert !
are you still there ?
my father .
no stupid remark on hand , right ?
gretchen , guess what ?
hi , hein .
hi , phil .
we were studying anatomy .
about david , i got the histological result .
the stuff is called promidal .
paula is investigating a conspiracy .
doctors are tattooing notes on their patients ' asses .
anti hippocratic lodge .
i just need to find out what they tried to test on david .
i' m going back to the dissecting room .
sorry to bother you .
no problem .
anyway , phil couldn' t get it up .
philip ?
hormones .
low blood pressure .
we are all doctors , aren' t we ?
we want to go out for dinner and try again afterwards .
will you join us ?
i mean , for dinner .
well , no .
but thanks .
and have fun .
good luck .
bye .
professor .
i' m glad you' re still here .
do you have any idea why someone would inject a heart patient with promidal ?
promidal ?
that' s absolutely impossible .
i' m not a heart specialist , but ....
the young man with heart disease ....
i tested his blood ....
didn' t we close the case ?
yes .
why ?
do you wish to prevent me from ....
don' t you have enough work to do on your research project ?
have you already gathered all the histological results ?
i was going to do that tomorrow , before the lecture .
by the way , could you briefly list the differences between ... ... acute myelocytic and acute lymphocytic leukaemia ?
you accidentally cut yourself .
the scalpels are sharp .
i think he likes me .
i know that now .
you' re no good .
you' re arrogant because you' re so stupid .
cutting yourself like that ....
that feels good .
the bandage .
yes .
women know how to apply bandages .
you have a nice way of holding it in your hand .
tell me , in general , do you think it' s kitsch here ?
are you still interested in the anti hippocratic lodge ?
i' il drop by this evening around 10 : 30 or 1 1 : 00 .
shall we go ?
and i say , " don' t cut the eye !
it was already black , because the corpse had been there for so long .
anyway he says , " no , no .
i know what i' m doing .
he already had brains all over his lab coat because he had dropped them before .
i' ve seen this before .
up to the early 18th century this was a warning to traitors .
the herald of punishment .
a scalpel slashed the left cheek of the guilty party three times .
three cuts opened throat , chest and belly .
watch out !
i have a knife !
what are you doing ?
what are you doing in my room ?
ls gretchen here ?
i wanted to talk to her , because ....
did you see that shit over there ?
some asshole tried to ....
what' s wrong ?
are you hurt ?
it' s just gretchen .
i think ...
... she doesn' t love me anymore .
come on .
you have some problems in your relationship .
gretchen feels really bad about it , too .
get out !
we don' t want people like you here !
calm down , grandpa !
they even paid me to leave the four seasons immediately .
a free dinner would be fine , too .
and my dessert ?
wow !
sweetie !
you' re totally wild !
but gretchen will only let really hard hansels in .
what do you mean by that ?
anatomy test .
this morning i had a burst prostate gland on the table .
did i do anything wrong ?
i' m sorry . ls it over ?
too bad ... ... that these things are so sensitive !
when you cut them open they look simple .
gretchen !
you know , women often don' t take the time to understand men .
i mean , i' m not a great conversationalist .
you know what i mean .
yeah .
but i' m still delicate and sensitive ... ... even if i give the impression of being outwardly strong .
are you already ... ?
shall i ... ?
no , no .
it' s just that i' m very emotional about gretchen , because
oh , i' m sorry .
no .
hein was about to ....
no , no .
no , you wanted ....
i didn' t mean to disturb you .
lf you two have something important to ....
hein , you can stay .
it' s not so important .
we could do it some other time .
bye .
well , no ....
hey , wait a minute .
you wanted to tell me something about ....
yes , hein .
what' s that ?
a corpse slashed back at me .
see you .
give my regards to gretchen .
i don' t want to hurt her .
four ?
well , sweetie .
you' re my fifth failure .
though sex on the job is ... ... the most natural thing in the world .
you' re a nightmare for any tough guy .
poor , little phil .
you' re a horrible men' s club , and i' m god' s punishment .
are you finished again already ?
gretchen ?
such a beautiful body ... ... and such an ugly , little whore' s soul .
do you have any idea of how much you' ve hurt me ?
i loved you .
do you think i have no feelings ?
what did you inject me with ?
i can' t stay with a whore anymore .
what did you inject me with ?
no , it' s not about us anymore .
you' ve ruined everything .
i injected 15 mg .
that' s quite a lot .
it should work quickly .
your blood .
do you remember ?
like gum .
got you .
i see , you want to go outside .
wait , i' il help you .
but i believe you can' t make it .
shall we bet on it ?
hey , if you manage to cross the threshold , i' il set you free .
okay ?
on your marks , get set , go !
yes !
just a few more centimetres .
maybe she' il make it .
but then ....
that' s mean .
what are you doing to me ?
you beautiful , beautiful body .
don' t be afraid .
i will preserve you , forever .
every day the door is open .
today it' s my turn , and it' s closed .
it' s always open .
only today it isn' t .
what the hell is going on ?
just some student' s joke .
thank you , mrs. stbel .
fatma , you can clean up later .
yesterday i walked in and found half an intestine under a table .
fuck .
all those guts .
fucking students .
you' re lucky if you don' t run into one in a real operation .
could you say just one sentence without using the word " fuck " ?
after all , there are dead bodies here .
fuck .
okay darlings .
who will end up under a scalpel today ?
please .
come on .
number five .
sixteen .
sixteen .
three .
yes .
and six .
six .
it won' t open .
the janitor should repair this shit .
come on , take the next one .
there .
what' s this ?
they' ve cut his head off .
the threats by the anti hippocratic lodge ... ... prove that i' m on the right track .
lf it was blood you won' t be able to remove the stains from your sheets .
it' s better than brains .
i ruined a new cashmere sweater
could one of you be serious ?
there' s a criminal organisation in heidelberg .
what' s that supposed to mean ?
your blood will be next ?
okay , all those rites and stuff are a bit old fashioned .
but the idea of unethical research is not that outdated , is it ?
blood in the bed , in a girl' s room ....
it sounds more like one of phil' s disgusting jokes to me .
by the way , where is he ?
have you seen phil ?
i' ve seen a bit of him around .
therefore , ladies and gentlemen , diverticulosis is ... ... a typical illness in the western world .
as you can see ....
you may now depart for your weekend .
i need not remind you of your upcoming exams .
be glad .
those who pass will have more room to work and ... ... many more corpses .
hi , paula .
i wanted to thank you for your time yesterday .
you know it makes a person feel good to see ... ... someone show concern .
i solved my problem with gretchen , too .
really ?
i thought she was away for the weekend .
look , i brought you something .
you shouldn' t have .
cardiomyopathy aaa !
no storage
from gretchen .
and paula , you really should stop all this nonsense ... ... about david .
you' re getting in the way of our research .
david' s body wasn' t worth anything anymore .
he was doomed .
it was obvious .
paula .
i really like you , but
ls this some stupid joke ?
hein , you psychopathic asshole !
don' t yell like that .
we' re not alone .
gretchen  0172/ 555 22 97
the person you have called is temporarily not available .
this means there is no corpse .
not anymore .
but ....
you don' t know this mysterious david' s last name ... ... or where he lives .
which state is he from ?
well at least we know his brand .
this secret organisation .
this anti coppo ...
anti hippocratic lodge . ... copocrats .
but , don' t you understand ?
what about gretchen ?
margarete milmann .
it' s been days since  listen , miss .
a female student hasn' t slept in her bed for one night .
so ?
a medical student .
a chopped off finger ?
do you remember last year when those two girls reported ... ... that a headless corpse was waving its hands in the dissecting room ?
yeah , high voltage cable .
hi , paula .
still pursuing conspirators ?
caspar ?
oh , frank . ls ....
have you seen gretchen ?
yes .
she might be ....
hello ?
paula ....
dear gretchen !
i need to talk to you !
regards , paula
you must come .
forget the others .
this is our project .
okay , see you .
have you seen gretchen ?
i heard voices in the dissecting room .
gretchen ?
shit .
gretchen is on table three .
or perhaps four ?
quit cracking idiotic jokes , you psychopath .
where is gretchen ?
well , take a look .
come on .
you' re usually so curious .
you' re completely  you whore ... ... look for your whore friend !
are you afraid of corpses ?
table three or table four ?
three or four ?
maybe she' s still alive .
maybe now she isn' t anymore .
jokes .
it' s just fun .
stupid students ' jokes .
dead bodies .
old , dead , disgusting flesh .
jokes , they' re all jokes , paula .
are you afraid of me now ?
paula !
wait up .
paula .
wait a minute .
don' t be afraid .
it was just for fun , nothing more .
come on , paula .
there' s no need to be afraid of me .
i was just joking .
paula , wait .
morgue
ls anyone here ?
what are you doing here ?
don' t be afraid .
you' re safe here .
the lodge is off limits .
the anti hippocratic lodge .
you too ?
yes , of course .
anti hippocratic simply means the desire to work as a scientist ... ... mostly in an unspectacular way , but without petty bourgeois limitations .
there are psychos with scalpels outside .
just big mouthed louts ... ... who enjoy frightening girls .
do you think it' s possible to make progress in research ... ... while adhering to ethical principles ?
heidelberg has a reputation to maintain .
do you know when we won the last nobel prize ?
medical research is highly competitive ... ... funds for research , commissions from the pharmaceutical industry ... ... it' s all about financing the education of an elite .
your little series of experiments ....
where do you think those tissue samples come from ?
well , i was just asking myself
just ask a so called ethical board for their opinion ... ... on testing leukaemia patients without their knowledge .
i had no idea .
of course not .
and who cares ?
a terminally ill patient barely notices .
everyone wants to be cured , but no one wants to pay the price .
but , the crimes committed by the anti hippocratic lodge ....
my god .
the embarrassing slips made by a few nazi doctors ... ... of course these must be rejected .
but the achievements of those times ... ... have been lost .
especially in anatomy .
when your grandfather developed promidal
what ?
well , of course .
grand master of the lodge up to the end of the war .
i thought you knew that .
but  your grandfather .
they were just terminally ill prisoners , worthless lives .
but those fantastic specimens !
vivisected !
honey !
you' ve already arrived !
did they give you the message ?
what about ?
your grandfather ....
what' s wrong ?
but i wanted ....
he' s so disgusting .
paula , we can break a body down into molecules and examine it .
but we can' t grasp the soul' s basic essence .
ls it all true ?
you hate him and you love him at the same time .
i know that feeling well .
i' ve known it for about 50 years .
quiet please !
the human specimens which were preserved were all morituri .
two carcinomas , one leukaemia , one advanced myocarditis .
i confess to having broken the rules in the two aforementioned cases .
enough !
you have murdered human beings !
fellow students !
this is beyond  i have broken the rules ... ... set down in the book and accept the penalty .
young man , the lodge provides a traditional form for our research
for hypocritical chatter about forbidden pharmaceutical experimentation ?
to get money from the pharmaceutical industry .
the lodge has always disregarded laws and prevailing morals , on a grand scale .
you are destroying everything with your petty bourgeois morals !
i know the rules .
what we are doing is pure research .
not your fucking , bourgeois medicine .
what do i care about the aches and pains of a pensioner ... ... who' il kick the bucket two years from now ?
take a look at our specimens .
that is science !
that is for eternity !
as his professor and grand master , i take full responsibility .
a murder committed out of jealousy is no internal matter for the lodge .
i will pass this case on to the police ... ... with all its consequences , even those which involve me .
you won' t do that .
did you hear me ?
you won' t do that !
you' il regret it .
this is the hennings ' answering machine .
we' re momentarily not at home .
please leave us a message .
we will call you back .
this is grombek .
a message for miss paula henning .
please call me back .
it' s urgent .
heidelberg , 23 17 96 .
or preferably , drop by tomorrow morning to see me .
we have a far larger problem ... ... than i feared .
it seems it will be necessary to inform the police .
i think , i will need your help .
i know i' m not a great doctor .
i don' t have your talent .
i could never prove that there are also other ways .
but you are strong , paula .
you have a heart .
you can do everything differently .
meet me today at 8 . 00 p . m . in the specimen hall .
grombek .
only at 8 . 00 p . m . ?
caspar is up in our room .
the others are studying for the mid term exam .
have you by any chance seen gretchen ?
no .
paula , what' s wrong ?
hi .
gretchen hasn' t shown up yet and my grandpa ....
come in .
i thought she was away for the weekend with phil ?
yes , but it' s just ....
what i wanted to say was ....
professor ?
professor grombek ?
hello ?
my most beautiful work .
because i really loved her .
lsn' t the human body a miracle ?
so cleverly constructed .
an incredibly intelligent system ... ... of such breathtaking beauty .
that' s why i became a doctor .
wasn' t that why you did ?
these vivid colours .
and the tissue ....
so rich .
it' s like capturing life for a moment .
promidal has nothing to do with preserving decomposing flesh .
look , i cheated here .
the carotid belongs to someone else .
gretchen' s was twisted in such a strange way that ....
but look here .
her heart .
fantastic .
the face ... ... is just for me .
i can put it on her , when i' m alone
you don' t understand ?
most people don' t understand .
gretchen will be beautiful for me .
forever .
and you will be beautiful , too .
caspar ?
that wasn' t nice of you .
i was looking for you , because i wanted to explain ... ... and then this crazy guy headed for you with a syringe .
did he give me a shot ?
a huge one !
quick , caspar .
a hypertonic saline solution .
10 % sodium chloride in  this isn' t appropriate timing , but ... ... l' m not a doctor .
what ?
history .
i' m writing a thesis on the anti hippocratic lodge ...
... from their origins up to 1945 .
a syringe !
there , behind the door .
ln the middle cabinet .
hurry !
i just wanted to go down to the library ... ... since they normally won' t let anyone in .
take the small bottle of sodium chloride .
what ?
' n ' , ' a ' , ' c ' , ' l ' .
here .
they would have found out after mid term exams .
but i have nearly everything i need .
tell me ...
... do you think something dangerous ....
caspar .
my real name is oliver kaufmann .
great .
prepare the syringe .
okay .
turn it over .
like this ?
oh , like on tv .
now in the air ?
and now in the butt .
no ! ln the vein .
like on tv .
no .
i can' t do it .
caspar !
i need the saline solution .
otherwise i' il die .
come on !
at a low angle into the vein .
that wasn' t at all bad for a historian .
wouldn' t it be safer to call the hospital ?
tell me , why did you have promidal in the bathroom cabinet ?
promi ....
what ?
promidal .
the stuff they killed those people with .
that' s our bathroom .
the deodorant is mine , too .
what is the meaning of this ?
hey , guys .
i' m not a doctor .
this interests me only as a historian .
take a look .
these drawings are by paula' s grandpa .
the act of procreation in cross section .
an eternal hard on , one could say .
or , if you prefer , half a hard on .
hein has injected you with 3 units .
so you will be with us for about four hours .
lf you keep your heart rate slow .
after all , it contains an analgesic .
as student of medicine i find it somehow ... ... interesting .
you can watch how ....
would you like a cookie ?
when you' re stoned while doing it , it' s ....
well ?
did you sleep with the little whore , too ?
who ?
gretchen ?
leave that alone .
don' t play around with it .
you' re not in a position to crack stupid jokes just now , caspar .
are you insane ?
you impotent asshole !
keep your mouth shut ... ... or i' il cut your vocal cords .
i' m going to kill this arrogant bastard .
this can' t be true .
keep your mouth shut , damn it !
shut up , that won' t help
what' s happening here ?
i need saline solution .
nacl , you asshole !
' n ' , ' a ' .
could someone stitch me up ?
fucking medical assholes .
there' s blood within the shoe .
it was all just a joke !
you pig !
hi .
so ?
what is it ?
everything' s still there .
don' t complain so much , caspar .
who knows , what permanent damage
besides , my name is oliver .
this is just a check up .
i soothe your pain .
i' m a doctor .
but your not practising .
this is in bad taste .
my god , it' s terrible when one thinks about it .
ludwig was always a bit weird .
but hein ....
hein was actually ....
ln scientific terms , he was brilliant .
sure , in scientific terms ....
have you seen the specimens ?
i mean gretchen .
before the police ....
yes , in scientific terms , he was brilliant .
ln private life he was also absolutely okay .
evenings at the lodge ....
pity about the lodge .
i' m going to a hospital in berlin .
they say there' s a good lodge there .
lsn' t that where they experiment anaesthetics on patients ?
and you ?
i' m taking over my father' s studio .
private studios are rarely inspected ... ... so you can play around a little .
do you already know who' s going to be grombek' s successor ?
stievers , i believe .
ls he also ....
tradition .
good morning .
' morning , mr. taxidermist .
how are you ?
same as always .
