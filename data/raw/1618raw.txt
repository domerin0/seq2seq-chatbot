we have seen a star in the east .
it told us the son of god is born .
nativity play/ sermon/ dinner
the lord jesus was laid in a manger ... ... to bring salvation to the souls of those ... ... with no place of their own .
nothing is harder than to have no place ... ... but many are those without one .
tell me about it !
i want you to be here .
not me , thanks .
be quiet !
jesus was born to offer those alone a place in which to be alive !
joy to the world , the food has come .
gin !
it' s " the lord has come " !
you don' t know much , do you ?
more than some faggot .
i am a mistake made by god .
in my heart , i am a woman .
women can have children .
what if a miracle like the virgin mary getting pregnant ... ... was to happen to a homo ?
better give me a little extra .
after all , i' m eating for two .
serves you right !
miyuki !
time to eat !
miyuki !
close your legs !
act like you were a woman .
i am a woman .
and it' s a waste to spill food like that .
don' t just gobble your bread .
eat it with love for the people who made and brought it here .
i hate that bible thumping .
you' re just like akiko .
who' s akiko ?
my old lady .
well !
don' t call your mother that .
eat shit , you old fart .
shit " i' il take , but " fart " i won' t !
that hurts !
you old ... ... " bag lady .
you peep pretty loud for a chick that can' t even find its own worms .
should a burden on society like you be talking ?
you' re a burden on us .
what does that make you ?
the kettle the pot' s calling black !
you mouthy brat !
can' t you at least get along at christmas ?
oh , yes ....
miyuki , i got you a present .
they' re gone !
a whole set of " world literature for children .
why would i need that ? !
hana looked hard for those !
even a homeless teenage runaway needs a christmas present !
i choose not to go home .
six months on the street means you don' t have a home .
i can go home any time i want to .
it' s the ones who say that who never do .
speak for yourself , you old geezer !
what are you doing to dostoevsky ? !
i won' t take that , today of all days !
not even my father ever hit me !
so i' il do it for him !
grow up , will you ? !
don' t hurt yourselves .
show more respect , kid !
i' m not a kid !
with little tits like these ?
you filthy old pervert !
that' s harassment !
will you two stop !
huh ?
it' s been ... ... abandoned .
there , there , there .
care for this child .
what a world !
oh , man !
oh , my !
you' re a little girl .
i wonder what your name is .
john doe .
she' s a girl , i said !
he' s so rude !
how old was i when i started living like this ?
thirty something ?
i still thought that i was better off ... ... than a child with no home .
there , there , now !
we' il take you somewhere warm .
the cop shop' s that way !

sorry !
what do you mean , take her with us ?
i' m just doing god' s will .
her parents might come back .
what parent would leave a child out in this cold ? !
that' s a devil , not a parent !
kiyoko wanted us to find her .
kiyoko " ?
kiyoko " ?
why " kiyoko " ? !
from kiyo , " pure , " on this purest of nights .
how tacky !
kiyoko' s a fine name !
did you have a girlfriend named that ?
idiot !
look , we can' t just name her !
she' s not a puppy or a kitten !
so i' m taking her home .
to a cardboard box ?
there' s no room !
this is a once in a lifetime chance !
let me feel like a mother !
a little baby / powdery snow on its cheeks / on this holy night .
directed by satoshi kon
peek a boo !
oh , dear !
tell me what' s wrong !
shut up !
hey !
i know , i know , he' s not your mommy .
he' s just a homeless homo .
don' t say that in front of her !
a baby crying around here will sound weird !
we' re going to take you to the police soon , okay ?
you' re not going anywhere , are you ?
idiot !
we' re taking her to the police !
don' t shout or she' il never shut up !
why won' t you stop crying ?
are you hungry ?
there , there !
maybe she' s sick .
tomorrow ....
i promise i' il take her then .
christmas should be the happiest day of the year .
if we take her in now , it' il always be the worst day of her life !
maybe ... ... she needs a diaper .
hana , boil some water .
i' il make some milk .
hey !
whose side are you on ? !
go buy some water !
my angel isn' t drinking from the tap !
why me ?
where does a bum get off telling me " them that works eats " ?
just for tonight , remember .
tomorrow we take her to the police .
so " no man is an island " after all , huh ?
you' re buying water ? !
a christmas miracle .
what a haul !
watch where you' re going , brat !
you watch where you' re going !
i was married once .
with a child ?
no , don' t tell me !
i don' t want to hear this !
you never forget for one second .
a child' s the only thing you hold dearer than life itself .
a boy ?
no .
bullshit !
come on !
give it back !
hey , you' re the girl who hangs out with gin .
get out of here , will you ?
we don' t want gin after us .
why not ?
you' re the light of his life , that' s why not !
there' s not much light in a cardboard box .
let me have this book .
how old ?
twenty one , i think .
five or six years older than miyuki , i guess .
that old ?
if she was alive .
when i was 20 i got a girl pregnant , and we got married .
i was in heaven .
you could have poked me in the eye and i' d have just smiled at you .
but my daughter got sick , and the medical bills were huge .
i was something of a bicycle racer then .
i needed money .
there was this race ....
you threw it ?
a punk i knew had this scheme .
they found out , i got kicked out of racing , and my girl died .
i just didn' t feel like working anymore .
and then my wife followed my daughter .
oh , no !
that' s how you get to be a man like me .
i didn' t want to hear that !
i hate sad stories !
it' s freezing !
you' re used to this .
kind of .
i' il give her the milk .
dreams do come true .
i always dreamed of being the mother of a little girl .
a nice , warm house , a pretty daughter .
even if my husband was no good ... ... i would accept dire poverty as long as i had my child .
feed the poor kid !
you' re so pretty .
the prettiest little girl in the world .
what do you want ? !
they' re gone .
santa claus , maybe ?
uncle bag " and the baby are gone .
what' s that faggot thinking about ? !
man , he' s got big feet !
you can' t have feet fixed .
are you taking her back ?
there' s probably an apb out on her .
and for you .
i doubt it .
an arrest warrant , maybe .
her parents are probably sorry about this now .
so let' s take her to the police .
a baby' s always better off with its real mother .
not necessarily .
sometimes a foster mother' s better .
what ? !
don' t be stupid .
i never knew my real mother .
but i' il bet if she saw me now , she' d flip .
how can someone homeless raise a child ?
i know , i know !
i don' t want her shunted from one foster home to another ... ... without even one memory ... ... of ever having been loved .
you don' t have to be a foundling to feel that .
they must have had reasons .
nothing should make you abandon a child !
that means you' ve taken love and tossed it away , like trash .
yeah , but what can we do about it ?
find her mother .
and ask why she abandoned her baby .
if she can make me understand ... ... i' il forgive her , and my mother too .
find her ?
how ?
we' il have to pay again .
this is an expensive year end !
what if we find another baby ?
they don' t toss them out in twos .
another key !
look at these panties .
you' d catch cold in them !
are they the ones ?
are these your folks ?
look , business cards .
a hostess club won' t be open at this hour !
we' ve got some walking to do .
you' ve gotta be kidding !
he was eating for two !
but why pack like you' re off on a trip and then abandon a baby ?
maybe it was one last trip they were taking .
a family suicide ? !
then what do we do ?
we can' t search the next world !
shh !
we apologize for any inconvenience .
trains will be delayed due to heavy snowfall .
it' s so hot in here !
what a stink !
have you bathed lately ?
no .
or washed my clothes .
how embarrassing !
oh , dear !
there , there .
did she piss herself ?
that' s why it stinks !
it' s you that stinks !
quiet !
shut that kid up !
watch it !
hey !
miyuki !
what' s she up to ?
we wasted our train fares !
it was me who paid them .
i' m sorry !
there' s no more milk .
go ahead , blame it all on me .
oh , cheer up !
let' s sing a song .
what' s that ?
the sound of music , of course .
never heard of it .
that' s going to make you even hungrier .
i' m starving !
i told you !
look after my little angel .
go on without me .
just say you' il never forget the queer you once knew .
look .
a cemetery .
i' m not dead yet !
now i' m alive again !
but there' s nothing for a baby in these offerings to the dead !
we' il get by !
yeah , sure !
we' il get by !
people keep on saying that till they end up living like us !
and while we keep on saying it , the kid' il end up under a stone here .
kiyoko " !
she has a name !
yeah , whatever .
and she' s cute .
she' s so pretty .
but listen to me .
i' m serious .
you listening ?
if you really care about that kid ... ... you' il find her someone to take care of her .
i speak from experience .
that' s what her parents said , i bet .
what do you mean ?
i wouldn' t abandon a kid .
don' t be stupid !
no .
your family abandoned you !
there you go again !
am i going to sit and listen ... ... while some dumb faggot pisses on me ?
what are we doing here ?
tell me .
wracking our brains !
we' re scavenging offerings left in a cemetery .
and why ?
because we' re homeless .
stop it !
no !
i' m not going to stop .
we are three good for nothing bums ... ... who can' t even look after ourselves .
shut up !
i' m thinking !
i won' t shut up .
you can' t get milk from an old queer' s tits , no matter how hard you think .
come on , hana !
you know we can' t do this .
speak for yourself !
this way the whole family will be dead .
oh , my !
you' re so lucky , kiyoko !
god must really love you !
then why was she ... ... dumped ?
left !
that' s a dead end !
it' s right !
tails .
heads .
what' s this guy doing parking like that ?
doesn' t he know what a " public thoroughfare " is ?
how did that happen ?
bad luck .
the car got stuck , and i forgot the parking brake .
then someone shouted , " dorothy , wait ! " . . . ... and then i heard , " whoops ! " ... ... and the damn car rolled on top of me .
i don' t bring my men with me when i' m visiting the old man' s grave .
i owe you .
call me if you' re ever in trouble .
oh , no , we never have any trouble .
you' re from kinshicho ?
we were just going there .
i know it' s rude to ask ....
if it' s rude , then don' t ask .
come on .
would you know this establishment ?
midori
know it ?
its owner' s marrying my daughter today .
he' s one of my men , but he' s too cocky .
i was against it .
but your daughter chose him .
the daughter i brought up , married to a man like that ....
know what i mean ?
but if your daughter' s happy with him ... ... isn' t that the main thing ?
you' re right !
i went to the old man' s grave so i wouldn' t cry at the wedding .
watch the road !
good evening , sir !
make yourselves at home .
daddy , you' re late !
sorry , sorry .
i almost got killed .
i owe them my life .
my daughter , kiyoko .
oh .
hello .
what have you gotten us into ? !
just shut up and eat !
diaper change .
your turn , miyuki .
don' t you think kiyoko has amazing luck ?
yeah .
maybe she does .
oh , yeah .
her name' s sachiko .
not " midori " ?
just at the club .
she' s sachiko , " happy child , " though she didn' t look it .
but some plastic surgery turned her into a good little earner .
she quit .
said she was pregnant .
do you know where she is ?
i doubt you' il wring any money out of her .
no , i have something to give her .
i' m sorry i spilled your food .
you remember her ?
midori , the skinny broad .
she said her husband was in debt .
what' s wrong with you ?
that bastard .
do you know him ?
then she borrowed more money from us ... ... and ended up screwed both ways .
you know where she is ?
if it weren' t for his damn get rich quick scheme ...
if it weren' t for his damn get rich quick scheme ... ... i' d still be with my wife and kid !
but aren' t they both dead ?
i' il kill the bastard !
you' il get killed !
mitsuo !
mitsuo !
it was that maid !
are you okay ? !
she' s got a gun !
hey , what ? !
kiyoko !
miyuki !
hey !
thank you very much .
she' s got a gun , you know !
our lives are already wasted !
hana !

send it to ... ... the tokyo tower .
my name is
hey !
wait a minute .
we' re homeless bums , not action movie heroes .
what we need now is the police .
if you like the police so much , get them to adopt you !
those children are like family !
i thought i could depend on you !
don' t talk like you were my damn wife .
i' m not going anywhere .
gin !
we' ve done all we could .
you' re giving up ?
there' s nothing we can do .
you are really the lowest of the low !
the best thing you' il ever do is die in the gutter !
oh , poor you !
you' il be dead and no one' il care !
all you ever do is cause people trouble !
dead or alive , you' re living trash !
the king of trash !
okay , so i' m trash .
but you' re ugly .
yes ?
i want to get rid of some trash .
i don' t think i' d fit .
yeah , that' s what i am , living trash !
who cares if you die in the gutter ?
you' re dead all the same .
you okay ?
hang in there , gramps .
may i make one last request ?
what ?
give me a drink of that .
you' re not selling me into slavery !
somebody , help !
i always wanted to die drunk , in a nice old house .
now i' m halfway there .
fate works in strange ways .
i' ve lived a long time ... ... but i' m just trash , as worthless dead as alive .
don' t talk like that !
you remind me of myself when i was younger .
looking at you now ... ... may i make a last request ?
get rid of this for me .
some people will be hurt if it' s known who i am .
okay .
i understand .
no one will ever know .
take care of yourself , okay ?
may i make a last ... ?
request ?
and now , goodbye .
that' s it !

her foreigner husband looked like he was in a real bad mood .
did he hit her ?
no , she was being real nice for a girl so young .
my wife could learn something !
his foreign assailant fled , taking a young woman and a baby hostage .
with the groom in serious condition , police speculate this may be a war ... ... between crime syndicates .
hey , this is serious !
i' m not kidding around , either !
my mom' s religious .
she chants all the time .
me .
isn' t she cute ?
i found her .
those spots on her back look like wings .
so i called her " angel .
but she' s gone .
father .
i stabbed my father .
i can never go back .
the baby ?
a gift from god .
yes .
give me a break !
i' ve got a family at home !

miyuki ... ... i' m so glad you' re safe .
where' s the geezer ?
he could be dead for all i care !
i' m dying .
maybe he went home .
who cares ?
all he thinks about is himself .
yeah , miss hana , but you' re in love with him , aren' t you ?
don' t be silly !
i like my men to be more " manly .
the kind of man i like is slender , middle aged , tanned ... ... with a divine square back haircut and a lower town accent ... ... who says , " ah , what the hell " ... ... when i don' t quite have the cab fare .
so , what now , miss hana ?
why are you calling me that ?
uncle bag " is fine .
it' s hard to say .
i' m glad .

an ambulance .

kiyoko can' t sleep out on the street !
the geezer' s not here , we' re freezing , sleepy , hungry .

i never thought i' d be here again .
i' m sorry .

hana !
mother !
hana !

some kids beat me up .
i guess i' m just not an action hero .
he said he knew you .
but he said he was homeless , you know .

since ken died i' m like a canary ... ... that' s forgotten its song .
you sing all the time !

i wish i could have one !
so ken died , did he ?
alds ?
he slipped on the soap .
well , death is always a hair' s breadth away .
but if you were in trouble , why didn' t you come back ?
we certainly had fun here , didn' t we ?
in this old bar
i' ve had so much to drink
my old memories
all start to blur
my lover
has left me
people call me notorious
aw , you' re ugly !
good for nothing
get off !
good for nothing
what a terrible thing to say
eat shit , you old fart !
shit " i' il take , but " fart " i won' t !
i couldn' t come back after i' d done that .
a little bit of money took care of that .
i' m just happy you' re all right .
stop it !
you scare me when you start crying .
what about that baby ?
is the girl its mother ?
well ....
where is your mother , anyway ?
abandoned ? !
yes !
i' ve been abandoned !
them' s the breaks , i guess .
i could see me in her .
born on the street , and back there again .
that' s why i want to find her a home full of love !
all i ever wanted was love !
ow !
what the hell ? !
the geezer' s come out .
where are my clothes ? !
way to go , gin !
come back any time .
thank you , mother .
my mother' s white breath / as she watches me set out / on a long journey .
oh , man !
an empty building' s always nice , but look who got here first .
i' d just love to fill up on some meat !
don' t you dare !
just kidding !
the snow' s let up .
miyuki , will you go shopping ?
okay .
get me some sake .
just one .
no !
i wish .
honey , i' m home .
you stayed in there ?
you' d think you were homeless !
actually , we' re looking for these people .
sachiko nishizawa .
do you know her ?
she never paid me back for her neighborhood association dues .
are you a relative ?
no !
we' re acquaintances of a relative .
her husband was no better .
gambling day and night , and mean when he drank .
living on his wife' s earnings and borrowed money .
where are they now ?
i wouldn' t know .
mrs. kurumizawa might .
they left about three months ago .
the house was seized for debt .
one night they just up and went .
they were a nice couple at first ... ... but it wasn' t long before they started fighting .
that' s poverty for you .
all that debt didn' t stop him from lording it over her .
even the most dedicated wife has her limits .
you' d see bruises sometimes .
the poor woman .
not on her , on him !
oh , dear !
but his mother would always take his side against her .
his parents built them this house .
where do they live ?
mrs. yamanouchi might know .
her mother in law was always complaining ... ... that she never did any housework .
but her son was perfect , of course .
of course !
that' s why i told her ... ... she' d never see a grandchild with his wife working in a club .
but she did get pregnant .
well , a man and a woman ....
they can always find time ... ... to do what they must !

what if they ran out from this new place too ?
what a horrible man !
poor sachiko !
working to pay off her husband' s gambling debts !
right !
but i never thought of abandoning the kid !
huh ?
nothing .
that' s no reason to just dump the kid !
i' ve said that all along .
angel has come home .
dad .
doesn' t it ever get tired of snowing ?
thank you .
i wonder how we look to them .
like a bum , a homo , a runaway and a foundling .
kiyoko is god' s messenger .
we' re her servants .
unpaid servants .
paying for a father' s sins .
yeah , if her father had been any good at all ... ... we wouldn' t be going through all this .
even a good for nothing father never forgets a child .
i' m going out .
what' s the matter with her ?
a child never forgets its parents .
i never stop wanting ... ... to see my daughter , just once .
so she' s alive ?
yeah .
and your wife ?
i' m sure she' s remarried ... ... and living happily .
hello .
it' s me , miyuki .
why did you split up ?
drinking and gambling .
what ? !
just like ....
i' m a louse .
but i' ve always wanted to do something for her as a father ... ... even just a little .
when i was gambling this would have been nothing .
now i' ve had to sweat blood just to save 30, 000 yen .
that' s great , gin !
we can stuff ourselves !
stuff you !
ishida speaking .
miyuki ?
is that you ?
are you all right ?
i' m sorry !
i' m sorry !
i' m sorry !
excuse me , but if you wouldn' t mind ....
get out , " you mean ?
other customers might like to sit down .
there' s hardly anyone here !
you guys stink !
what are you ?
homeless or something ?
does trash have kids too ?
just like real people ?
who are you looking at ?
hold it , you !
sir !
no !
hold it , i said , you low life !
it' s new year' s sale time at the food store !
come to the food store for all your special new year' s needs !
see in the new year with your family !
call an ambulance , quick .
right !
i knew it !
kiyoko really is the messenger of god !
hey !
miss hana !
hey !
hana !
following a recent gangland shooting incident ... ... police are seeking a fugitive thought to be latin american .
mitsuo hiruta , shot three times ... ... in protecting the leader of his syndicate ... ... will be questioned after he recovers from his wounds .
isn' t she cute !
when was she born ?
not long ago , i guess .
so the mother ....
i' m not .
what' s her name ?
kiyoko .
that' s my name too .
what a coincidence .
your friend is very weak .
make sure he gets rest and proper nutrition .
doctor !
believe it or not , we' re homeless .
i' m just a doctor .
rest and nutrition don' t fit with our lifestyle , you realize .
i can try to cure disease .
lifestyle is something you have to fix .
all anyone can do is their best .
take care .
the bill for today is 29, 830 yen .
bring your health insurance card and you' il get a refund .
i' m sorry , gin !
stop crying !
you' il get the bills all wet .
that' s 30, 000 yen .
kiyoko ? !
dad ?
so you took up nursing .
i see .
i' m glad you' re well .
oh , yeah , i' m just great .
how' s your mother ?
fine .
yeah ?
that' s good .
what are you doing now ?
i' m in recycling .
i had to drop something off here .
you must hate me .
i was never any kind of a father to you .
but that 30, 000 yen was money i' d saved up for you .
you may not believe it .
i always wanted to see you .
when i was little , mom and i searched for you .
we even checked unidentified corpses .
after you disappeared , mom ran the store herself .
the store ?
it was hard for a woman to run a bicycle shop alone .
that' s not quite the same as a bicycle racer .
the man you owed money to was shot and wounded the other day , you know .
he lived ? !
that' s a relief .
i thought you' d say that .
i ran up the debts , not him .
thank that doctor for me .
he seems like a nice guy .
i' m getting married .
oh ?
that' s good .
to him .
great !
but isn' t he about my age ?
he' s been married .
his daughter got sick and died ... ... and his wife followed her .
that man makes me so mad !
aren' t you moved ?
here' s the address and phone number .
yours ?
the old house is gone .
even if you can' t now , call me sometime .
kiyoko !
i' ve had about all i can stand !
miss hana ?
telling us you were a racer !
i was always at the track .
yeah , betting !
and your debts snowballed so you couldn' t face your family ... ... and you ran and hid in a cardboard box !
yes , damn it !
that' s what your father is !
he can' t bet , he' s spineless , his feet stink and he can' t drink !
he kills off his wife and daughter to buy sympathy !
he said you had an incurable disease !
with a father like that , you have my sympathy !
is this how you repay me ? !
repay you ? !
am i hearing right ?
if we' re talking about debt , i' m waiting for my change !
debt' s a concept you don' t even understand !
you understand how to troll through garbage cans !
and how to get in debt and how to make babies .
though you' re not too good at raising them , are you ?
and your debts you shove off on your wife .
always running away , never doing anything right !
running away' s the only racing you ever did !
miyuki !
we' re leaving !
miss hana ?
i guess he' s better .
should you have said that in front of her ?
if she' s his daughter , she' il forgive him .
being able to speak freely ... ... is the lifeblood of love .
maybe i' m na : i : ve .
so you' re in love with him ?
don' t be silly .
i' m the weeping red devil .
what ?
it' s a story i love .
there was a red devil who wanted to be friends with people .
but since he was a devil , no one would go near him .
so his friend the blue devil made a plan .
he' d wreak havoc among the people , and the red devil would save them .
when you try to achieve something , someone' s bound to get hurt .
you always have to sacrifice something .
the plan worked .
but the blue devil had to go away so they' d never know it was a trick .
it' s a sad story .
but that means you leave .
where will you go ?
it' s best for everyone when they' re with their family .
soon we' il find kiyoko' s mother .
and then what ?
you don' t have a real family !
rare " line of ones " wins lottery
numbers have been drawn for the annual new year' s jumbo lottery .
top prize in the 200 million yen lottery is a very rare number .
group 1 1 , number 1 1 1 , 1 1 1 ... ... is worth 50 million yen .
a different group pays 1 00, 000 yen .
to repeat , the winning prize number is ....
this just in .
police have released a sketch of an infant taken ... ... from a hospital in tokyo' s shinagawa ward .
we' ve come all the way here , but we don' t have her address !
the geezer' s got it !
let' s go back .
where are you going ?
the police !
what ?
you hated that idea !
i was just ego tripping .
now i want to apologize to her parents .
they might not be able to sleep waiting for news about her .
that' s what we said from the very start !
they might even be about to commit suicide !
i' ve done something that can' t be taken back !
i' il throw myself in this river .
i' il step neatly out of my shoes , stand on the handrail , and be at peace .
but then i' il see a baby' s face on the water .
no !
while i see this child' s face , i cannot die !
hey , you !
no !
you' re too young for this !
please !
let me die !
you !
sachiko nishizawa .
what were you thinking of ? !
is that an apology ?
if we hadn' t found this child , she would' ve frozen to death !
it wasn' t me !
my husband took her away when i wasn' t there !
i' ve looked and looked !
is that true ?
all i' ve suffered on account of that man !
hi , mom !
god really loves this child , you know .
i want you to give her lots of love too .
do right by her , or you' il pay for it .
i' m so sorry !
i' m sorry !
mrs. nishizawa !
what are you doing in here ? !
get out of here !
get out !
wait !
i' m no thief .
you' re lying !
get out !
where' s the baby ? !
did an old queer and a girl come to give it back ?
what are you talking about ? !
you abandoned a baby !
i can prove it .
are you a cop ?
huh ?
i' m just a bum who was passing by .
are you right in the head ?
i' m damn near crazy from all this !
why is the baby you abandoned on the news as being " taken away " ?
they' il call us kidnappers !
it wasn' t me .
that' s not my kid .
what ?
there , there !
don' t cry !
take care .
raise her right .
see you again someday .
never leave her again .
on the year' s last day / when all of a life' s accounts / have been settled up .
sachiko stole that baby out of the hospital .
she stole a baby and then abandoned it ? !
that' s a person' s life !
she lied to me about it !
and now it' s gone way out of control .
i don' t want anything to do with it !
take the kid to the police !
what ? !
don' t act like you' re not part of this !
you don' t want to get involved ?
you' re her husband !
that' s all over !
i' m getting my life back together .
look !
i won 1 00, 000 yen in the lottery .
my luck' s turned !
i know a guy just like you .
he threw away his life and his family .
no .
they threw him away .
i' m no loser !
these were in your wife' s bag .
any idea where she might have gone ?
she said she was going to be with her baby .
she was going to kill herself !
there' s no time to waste !
no !
she was just going to go look for the kid .
she' s desperate .
that only means one thing !
but where do i look ? !
hana !
miyuki !
kiyoko !
god must be busy at this time of year .
better once a year than never .
geezer ?
you' re too late .
you just missed a very moving finale .
what' s the matter ?
kiyoko " !
stomach " ?
mother " !
now that' s settled . . . ... what the hell do you mean ? !
fake !
the mother !
sachiko' s a fake !
pardon ?
why won' t you drink ?
a baby has to drink from its mother' s breast .
we' il never be close if you don' t !
sorry .
wrong people .
she can' t be far !
but where do we look ?
we can' t just give her up now !
that' s kiyoko !
should you be running ?
if i don' t run now , when will i ?
this way !
returning stolen goods to a thief !
how could we be so dumb ? !
who said " family suicide " ?
you did !
which way ?
left .
okay , right !
why ?
you' re a lousy gambler !
you got that right .
somebody help !
hey !
wait !
thief !
thief !
what' s wrong ?
a woman just stole my truck !
hey !
thief !
yes !
that woman !
she' s a baby thief !
be quiet , will you ?
please !
be a good baby !
stop !
give kiyoko back !
give me a break !
i' m forever in your debt !
gin !
that woman' s crazy !
get closer !
i can' t !
you have to , for kiyoko !
who' s kiyoko ? !
step on it like a man !
okay !
please !
be quiet !
gin !
geezer ? !
geezer !
go for it , gin !
no action star can touch you !
pass her !
we' il die !
step on it !
okay !
stop crying !
don' t be afraid .
i' il never leave you again .
you want to die ? !
gin !
gin !
there !
are you okay ? !
where' s kiyoko ?
faster !
okay !
which way ?
we' re at the scene ... ... where a truck has crashed into a building in shinagawa .
now a woman holding a baby has appeared on the roof .
witnesses say the woman is connected with the incident ... ... as she was driving the truck .
now there' s someone else on the roof !
stay away !
no !
tell me why you took that baby .
i didn' t !
this baby is mine !
you' re lying !
its real parents are worried sick about it !
that' s not true !
you of all people should know what it' s like to lose a child !
she' s dead .
my baby died before she was even born !
all the other babies looked so healthy there in the ward .
i wanted to die .
but then this baby smiled at me .
i decided she was mine .
i thought as long as i had her , everything would be fine .
my husband would mend his ways , and we' d be a real family .
that' s bullshit !
build a family by ruining a baby' s life ?
if you' re going to die , do it alone !
a life is a life .
it' s only born once .
you , me , or kiyoko .
give her back , okay ?
i want to be reborn .
sachiko !
sachiko , don' t die !
come back to me !
i was wrong !
please , don' t kill yourself !
we' il start again !
we' il be reborn !
sachiko !
i' il go first and wait for you .
sachiko !
please !
let me die !
kiyoko wants to see her mom and dad !
i want to go home .
i' m sorry !
take her ... ... to her mother and father .
oh , no .
hana !
i' m okay !
i' m still alive !
inspector , i don' t know how to thank you .
we' re not the ones you should thank .
man , that was a good sleep !
get me a cigarette , miyuki .
in my jacket .
yeah , yeah .
that was some new year' s !
it' s " no smoking " here .
lighten up !
i' m a hero !
you mean " we " !
i guess we won' t have to listen to kiyoko' s damn crying anymore .
she' s not " kiyoko " anymore .
i' m not pleased .
what can we do ?
not that .
this is a men' s ward !
perhaps we' re intruding .
no , it' s just ... ... i' m told they' re homeless .
who cares ?
we' d like them to be her godfathers .
come in .
excuse us .
the baby' s parents would like to thank you
dad ....
