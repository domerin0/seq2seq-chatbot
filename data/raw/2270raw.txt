that' s right .
not like the christmas he almost didn' t .
oh , my .
i almost forgot that story .
and i thought santa was gonna forget us !
what happened ?
well , it all started one windy winter' s night .
it was just a few days before christmas , and , naturally , we were all quite festive .
oh , you should' ve seen the wonderful snowfall .
it came down ...
mmm , needs more salt .
hoo hoo hoo hoo !
hey , guys !
wait for tigger !
dear santa .
well , guys , you' ve been awfully good this year .
what kind of presents would you like to ask for ?
i' d like a new fly swatter to keep the bugs off my carrots .
a fly swatter for ...
christopher robin , could santa also bring rabbit a small smackerel of honey ?
just in case certain ... guests drop in ?
eeyore ?
could use an umbrella to keep the snow off my house .
not that it matters if i don' t get one .
and a jar of honey for eeyore , too .
you think " sandy " claus will bring me a snowshoe for my tail ?
i take a size 4 , triple " e " .
now , why would you want that ?
allow me to demonster ate .
oh , yes .
i i see what you mean .
mm hmm .
what about you , piglet ?
oh , d d d dear .
i i really haven' t been able to decide .
um , w w whatever santa wants to bring is fine with me .
perhaps piglet would also like a few pots of uh , um ...
of honey ?
however did you guess ?
wait !
christopher robin !
we almost forgot !
what do you want for christmas ?
all i want is a sled ... one big enough for me and maybe ... a friend or two ?
that' s it , then .
next stop ... the north pole !
... hooray ! ... it' s on its way !
there it goes !
oh , d d d dear !

i know .
it seems as if i have forgotten , oh , something .
yes , pooh , you did .
of course !
it needs a present beneath it !
oh , but that' s what i came to tell you , pooh .
when we wrote our letter to santa , you didn' t ask for a present .
oh , bother .
what ever will we do , pooh ?
we shall swoop from the sky and snatch the letter before santa gets it !
are we ready to swoop yet , piglet ?
almost , pooh .
are you sure this balloon can carry both of us ?
oh , thank you , pooh oooooooooo !!
yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahh !

hoo hoo hoo hoo !
hiya , eeyore !

hope santa brings it .
well , of course he will .
we wrote him a letter from the heart .

eeyore wants an umbrella for his house , but what he really needs is a ... a new house !
hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo !

oh , split the difference ... make it a whole " condominimum " !
well , thanks .
and four snowshoes for tigger , so he can bounce six times higher !

how will it get to the north pole ?
someone must take it there himself .
um , uh , which one of us himselves did you have in mind ?
me .
you ?
but the north pole is so very far !
what if you can' t get back in time for christmas ?
it will be worth having no christmas , piglet , if i can bring christmas to all of you .
oh , pooh .

oh , come on , piglet , ol ' pal .

your christmas present !
oh , um ...

well , a alright , pooh , but ... but ... but it' s really ...
pooh looked and looked for piglet' s present .
he looked , and he looked , and he looked again .
and when he wasn' t looking , he * searched * instead .
but , alas for poor pooh , everywhere he looked and searched was still somewhere where it wasn' t .
pooh looked from christmas day all the way to new year' s eve , until he quite forgot what he was searching for in the first place .

pooh bear !
hmm , christopher ?
poo ooh ?

oh !
and we' il make our new year' s resolutions .
resol oceans ?
oof !

resolutions , pooh .
it' s when you promise to do something you' ve never done or not do something you used to do .
it' s a promise to be a better person in the new year .
hmm ... res o lutions !
and something sweet ?
that does sound like a party to me .
so where , may i ask , is this party to be ?
why , anywhere our friends are together , pooh .
well , in that case , i know just the place ...
rabbit' s house .
he certainly is a friend , not to mention , he always has a smackerel or three , and he never minds sharing one with me .
it would only be proper to ask first , pooh .
yes , alright , christopher .
i shall stop by rabbit' s house before i go and invite all the others to rabbit' s house .
happy new year , pooh .
see you at the party !
happy new year , pooh , happy pooh year , new
hope it' s sweet and sunny like a pot of honey
for a pooh year treat , friends will meet and greet
in the new year , pooh year , too !
deedledum
ooh dee la doo doo ho ho ho ho
there .
ha ha !
now , that' s a happy little carrot plant .
my , my , rabbit .
i didn' t know you could grow carrots indoors .
well , it' s ... it' s something only rabbits know .
you see , every year , i bring in the last carrot of the summer ...
there , there ...
i feed it , water it , and read to it all winter long , as recommended , of course , in this official carrot growing instruction manual .
then , in the spring ,
i use it to start my garden all over again .
ha ha ha !
hello , little fella .
yes , that' s it .
keep talking to it , piglet , while i get the plant food .
carrot plants love to be talked to .
oh , d d dear .
w w what do you suppose that might be ?
oh , d d dear !
what ever shall we do ? !
hello !
hello !
uh , h hello ?
my tummy' s always asking for honey .
but this is the first time that the honey has answered .
oh !
my carrot !
pooh , what are you doing in there ?
mmm .
your honey invited me in .
naturally , i didn' t want to appear unfriendly , rabbit .
neither did my tummy .
your tummy ? !
is that all you ever think about ?
well ? !
mmm .
i' m trying to remember .
where' s my carrot ?
and where' s piglet ?
a a a a choo ! ... bless you . ... bless you .
uh , thank you .
uh , piglet ?
what are you doing under there ?
we both got v very scared , a and i wasn' t sure what to do .
so i i thought this might be a good place for , uh , not being sure .
must you be afraid of everything , piglet ?
w well , i i i suppose that depends ... o on how f f frightening it is !
now what ?
who' s there ?
hoo hoo hoo hoo !
hiya , rabbit !
you want to hear the good news ?
hoo hoo hoo !
snow does not keep tiggers from bouncin ' , not one bitty bit .
hoo hoo hoo hoo !
agh !
get off me , tigger !
eeyore .
thanks for noticin ' .
what are you doing under there , besides being sad and gloomy ?
not much ... as usual .
hey , long ears !
want to see what else tiggers can do ?
they can throw a snowball and catch it themselves !
hoo hoo !
first , the windup ... then ... the toss !
and now the most tigger ific part ... the catch !
hoo hoo !
oopsy .
my carrot !
oh ho ho !
oh !
oh , thank goodness you' re okay .
tigger , there is such a thing as being excessively bouncy , you know .
oh , why , thanks , long ears .
that means a lot to me .
oh !
happy new year , tigger !
welcome to the party . ... party ? ... party ? !
well , thanks for invitin ' me .
here , let me help .
hoo hoo !
partying' s what tiggers like best .
what party ?
why , the one we' re having at your house , of course .
um , i did mention that , right , rabbit ?
what ? !
is that a " no , " rabbit ?
come on , long ears .
i' il help you decorate . ... uh oh ! ... not that !
piglet !
watch out !
whooooaaaa !
tigggerrrr !
oh !
oh , bother .
piglet !
save the carrot !

hoo hoo hoo hoo !
that' s it .
that does it .
out !
out !
everybody , out !
out !
i' ve had it !
my carrot will never make it through the new year with all of you around ... and neither will i !
we are both ... leaving !
... leaving ? ... leaving ? ... leaving ?
you mean g g going away ?
where ever will you go ?
oh ho !
someplace where there are no honey munching pooh bears , no petrified piglets , no gloomy donkeys , and no always bouncing tiggers !
sheesh !
the brain boggles .
what kind of place would that be ?
paradise !
rabbit ... gone ?
what will we do without him ?
well , we could have the party at your house , i suppose .
i know what you' re thinking ... it' s gonna be a little cramped , but , uh , since there is , um ... gonna be ... ... one less of us ...
oh , d d dear .
pooh , isn' t there something we can do to make rabbit stay ?
think , think , think .
perhaps since rabbit isn' t happy with the way we are , he might be happier with some way we ... aren' t ?
uh , you mean if we were different ?
no longer our warm , fuzzy selves ?
no more bundles of joy ?
oh , my !
we could all ... change .
we could all make a resolution .
a rusty tution ? !
a resolution , tigger .
it' s something christopher robin told me .
it' s a promise that you make to yourself to change .
uh , c change ?
well , if it means rabbit won' t move away , then ... then i' m ready to change .
me too !
me three !
well , i doubt it' il help , but count me in .
i promise not to eat honey ... ever again .
who said that ?
pooh bear !
you don' t know what you' re sayin ' !
if you can do it , pooh , so can i.
i p p promise not to be afraid anymore .
oh !
piglet !
what has come over you ? !
oh , well .
things can' t get any worse than they are now .
i promise to be so cheerful you won' t even know it' s me .
neither will i.
stickin ' with their pals is what tiggers do best .
so ...
i hereby and hitherforth promise to ... never bounce ... another bounce .
you got my word .
this tigger' s high hoppin ' days are history ! ... tigger ... ... that spring sproing in my step is gone ! ... tigger ... ... nevermore will i ever ...
tigger !
aggh !
what ?
oh .
yeah .
well , this is gonna be tougher than i thought .
but don' t worry ...
tiggers always stick to their rusty tutions !
stick ?
as in sticky ?
as in ... honey ?
and so pooh' s friends , trying to please rabbit , found themselves in a bit of a jam .
jam ?
as in honey ?
if pooh can' t eat honey ,
piglet can' t be afraid ,
tigger can' t bounce , and eeyore can' t be gloomy , then the question is ...
what do we do now ?
ankles aweigh !
uhh !
umph !
oh , d d dear .
tigger , a are you alright ?
oh , why , sure .
this is my tigger ific way of not bouncin ' .
see ?
i ... uhh !
umph !
oh .
oh , that' s good .
i i i was afraid you were hurt .
oh , i did it again ... said i was afraid .
uh , tigger , you' re never afraid , are you ?
i guess i was too busy bouncin ' to ever think about it .
so that means if i bounce , i won' t be afraid ?
why , it works for me .
hoo hoo hoo hoo !
well , at least it used to ... back in my bouncin ' days .
ha ha ha !
ha ha ha !
ha ha ha !
ha ha ha !
ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha !
look , tigger !
i' m bouncing !
i' m bouncing !
ha ha ha ha !
now i won' t be afraid of anything !
ha ha ha !
thank you , tigger !
thank you !
oh , how about that ?
i guess bouncin ' does keep you from being afraid .
look at the little guy .
he' s ... well ...
but that would mean that not bouncin ' might make a fella ... sorta ... squeamish ?
even ... a tad t trembly ?
just around the edges , uh ...
not to mention t t t teeterin ' ... on the brink of terror ? !
oh , d dear !
double " oh , d dear !
what' s that ?
aghh !
it' s got me !
aghh !
ha ha !
whew !
i' m not eating honey
not even thinking of thinking of thinking of eating honey
i' m not
i' m simply making sure that , um , the honey is , uh , safe .
why , hello , pooh bear .
what ever are you looking for ?
well , i i certainly wasn' t looking for , um ...
oh . ... honey .
well , that' s fortunate , because i just discovered the last little honey pot , much to my delight .
i couldn' t be happier for you ... even if i could be happier for you .
no honey .
no hope of any honey .
not even any hope of any hope of any honey .
pooh bear ...
i have this funny feelin ' .
what ever could it be ?
i' m sure i wouldn' t know .
think , think , think .
why , i believe it' s the honey that gives me this funny feeling and stops the rumbly in my tumbly as well .
i' m glad .
at least i think i' m glad .
i' m not sure how glad feels , but if i ...
why , that' s it , pooh !
i think i' m glad !

i bounced mine into itty bitty pieces , too .
oh , d d dear , i was so afraid for rabbit .
i didn' t keep my promise either .
well , it' s unanimous .
i was so upset , i forgot to be happy .
i suppose that means ...
goodbye , rabbit .
w wait a minute .
w what are you talking about ?
well , our new year' s resolutions , of course .
we tried to change for you .
hello !
happy new year !
is everybody ready for the party ?
we' re ready , alright ... for the world' s worst new year' s party .
what ever do you mean ?
it will be a new year ... but without our old friend .
our d dear friend .
our former friend .
that paragon of bunny dom ...
rabbit .
rabbit' s leaving ?
i know !
uh , leaving ?
me ?
now , why would i want to leave friends who are so loyal they would change just to please me ?
but we didn' t change .
we tried , rabbit , but ... we just stayed our same old selves .
and thank goodness for that .
why , what kind of a pooh bear would you be if you , uh , didn' t like honey ?
a very hungry one .
and a tigger who doesn' t bounce really isn' t a tigger at all .
you' re not just sayin ' that to mend our broken hearts , are ya ?
well , are ya ? !
oh , and , eeyore ...
this pooh shirt was too itchy , even for me .
and little piglet ...
oh , rabbit , i was afraid i' d never get to be scared again .
there , there .
you can hide under my bed whenever you want .
that rabbit , he just gives and gives .
please don' t change .
i like all of you just the way you are .
i' m the one who needs to change .
but , rabbit ... if you weren' t you , then we' d all be a bit less , um ... we .
exactly , pooh .
that' s what friends do for each other .
they help you to be more of who you are .
now , come on , everyone .
it' s time to celebrate the new year !
oh , at my house , of course !
5 ... 4 ... 3 ... 2 ... 1 ...
happy new year !
quiet , everyone .
uh , christopher robin has something to say .
i' d like to make a toast .
i love toast !
oh , have you tried it with honey ?
delicious .
here' s to the happiest of new years to all my wonderful friends .
let' s all raise a cup to ring in the new year .
happy new year .
i , uh , believe these are yours , tigger .
i' m very sorry if i ...
oh , that' s okay , ra ra .
let' s just let bygones be gone .
the important thing is that we' re pals forever .
am i right ?
abs o tutely , ol ' friend .
you see ?
nothing brings friends together like bells .
how true , how true .
and i think that calls for ...
one more round of , uh , " jingly bells " ?

jingly bells
jingly bells
on a new year' s eve
and i' m so glad to be right here
that i may never leave

we give to you our gratitude
for good times , joy , and fun !
