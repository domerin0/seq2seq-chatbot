the near future .
some young people deal with their disillusionment by seeking out illusions of their own in an illegal virtual reality war game .
its simulated thrills and deaths are compulsive and addictive .
some players , working in teams called ' parties ' . even earn their living from the game .
the game has its dangers .
sometimes it can leave a player brain dead , needing instant medical care .
such victims are called ' unreturned ' .
avalon .
you' re not ready for class a.
work a little more on b and c.
well done , ash .
still as good as ever .
charge me for one clip of 7 . 62mm ... ... and two clips of ppk .
two or three more ' completes ' and you go to the next level .
you' il have a time handicap .
you know that , don ' t you ?
i' il take the rest of my points in cash .
solo gets more dangerous the further you go .
are you sure you don' t want to join another party ?
good game , ash .
great tactics !
just like ash !
he' s faster .
and surer .
move !
ash ...
the circults aren ' t clear yet .
even you have to wait your turn .
i' il cancel , then .
do me a favor .
i can' t accept requests from lndivldual players .
it wouldn' t be fair
you know that .
i want data on that ' bishop ' who just cleared class a.
you can at least tell me more than the terminal did .
why are you interested ?
he' s challenging me .
but you never make contact wlth another player .
isn' t that your philosophy ?
' avalon ...
' ... faraway isle of legend ...
' ... of apple groves ...
' ... and mist ...
' avalon ...
' when will that day come ?
' avalon ...
' isle of faery ...
' ... where heroes go ...
' avalon ...
' a hero takes ship ...
' ... and sets sail ...
' ... to that isle of legend ...
' avalon ...
' to the nine sisters ...
' ... and avalon ...
' there together ...
' ... on that holy isle .
' o arthur ... ' ... your ship sets sail ...
' ... over the misty water to avalon . '
it' s you ...
you' re looking well .
i hear all kinds of things .
maybe because i was in wizard .
it' s a real drag , you know ...
i go to different branches , i hear things ... ... sometimes things i wish i hadn' t .
maybe it' s karma .
i hear that there' s a solo warrior who' s really good ... ... and that it' s a woman , too .
i started wondering , and what do you know !
did you search ?
for what ?
for my branch .
just dumb luck .
but if we ever teamed up again ... ... it' d be like fate was giving us a second chance .
i wish i was a warrior .
then i could play solo .
but who ever heard of ... ... a solo thief ?
we scout , we spring traps ...
we' re like river pilots ... .. or guides .
any party would be happy to have you , stunner .
it' s been a while since anyone called me that .
all of us old wizard members are still angry at each other .
all the other players ... ... resent us , too .
people said wizard was the toughest party of all .
but instead of that making my career ... ... it' s a handicap .
wizard was ...
i don' t want to hear .
i guess not .
that was then .
i don' t have time to rehash the old days .
ash ...
i don' t need thanks .
that' s not it .
what about murphy ?
maybe you haven' t heard ...
look , if you don' t want this ...
he went solo , too .
he got lost .
you must have heard about it ...
a hidden character in class a ?
a weird ' neutral character ' who appears when you' re ln there .
a silent young girl with sad eyes .
some people say she ' s just a bug ln the program .
she' s called ' the ghost ' .
whatever she ls ... ... no one who goes after her ever comes back .
so you' d thlnk no one would go after her , wouldn' t you .
even if you don' t care about sharlng data ... ... i' m sure at least you' ve heard the stories ... ... about a phantom field called ' speclal a ' ... ... where you can' t reset to escape .
a dangerous field , but you get tons of experience points .
they say the ghost ls the only gate lnto that field .
so they go after her .
anyone who wants to get into special a ... ... chases the ghost .
just like murphy dld .
stunner !
go around to the right and draw them off !
copper !
cuisinart !
masher !
concentrate your fire !
murphy . !
we ' re running low on ammo . !
let' s pull back . !
stunner , you ldlotl
stop bltchlngl
' reset ' ls not part of the wizard strategy . !
ash . !
ash . !
here arthur lies , klng once and king to be .
my id data ? !
come on ...
come on come on come on !
come on !
class a ' s busy today .
watch for time lags .
have you heard of ' the nine sisters ' ?
morgan le fay ?
morgan le fay ?
yes .
one of the nine fairy queens who rule avalon ... ... the legendary isle .
they lay the dying king arthur ... ... on a black ship and take hlm over the water to avalon .
the fairy morgan le fay ...
the queen north galys ... ...
the queen of the waste lands ... ... and ... ... his protectress , the lady of the lake .
there' s a story like that in northern europe .
odin goes on a journey .
his ship is wrecked and he drifts to an island far across the water ...
there morgan rescues him ... ... gives him a gold ring ... ... and grants him immortality and eternal youth .
but odin doesn ' t reallze ... ... that morgan has set a crown upon his head .
' the crown of oblivion ' ...
he forgets all about his homeland ... ... and all about the world outside .
begin .
hold it !
don' t shoot !
i' m jill , of ' the nine sisters ' .
it' s a pleasure to meet the famous ' ash ' .
welcome , ash .
thanks for accessing .
what do you want ?
i don' t expect data for free .
you don' t waste time .
maybe we' il take your gear , then .
lots of people would pay cash for your equipment data .
selling that data' s against the rules .
there are lots of ways to make a living in avalon .
tell me about ' special a ' .
you mean it ?
all i know is what i' ve heard .
only the real nine sisters would know .
if not them ...
who are the real ' nine sisters ' ?
they' re the ones who programmed this game .
murphy !
those bastards !
a time lag !
sorry i messed up the room .
don' t worry .
everyone has days like that .
from scythia to camelot c. scott littleton & linda a. malcor
the legend of king arthur richard cavendish
the chronicles of king arthur andrea hopkins
a kaleidoscope of arthurian legend toshlyukl takamlya
ash ... ... you look a bit pale .
feeling the effeots of reset ?
don' t get mad .
look , about the gate that lets you into special a ...
you want to know how you meet the ghost ?
have you had breakfast ?
you should eat sometimes .
i heard this from ... ... a party that lost a few people .
they say that every time the ghost appears ... ... there' s always a bishop there .
it' s the one common link .
a bishop ?
a bishop' s there every time a party sees the ghost .
as long as you have a bishop , you see the ghost ?
not only that .
some fools set themselves up with any old bishop ... ... and go ' ghost hunting ' .
that' s not how you do it .
what level ?
good question .
he has to be class a complete .
an archbishop , above level 12 .
that' s the condition .
no mistake .
so ?
are you going to switch from ' warrior ' ... ... to ' bishop ' ?
alone ?
murphy was solo .
a level 12 bishop ...
hey ... ... what level are you ?
12 ?
13 ?
but to switch to ' bishop ' ... ... you need double the experience points .
look at murphy .
you know how long it took him .
it takes time and money ... ... to make bishop .
you can' t do it without a party to back you up .
i couldn' t do it .
you could with a party .
but with your reoord , who' s going to link up with you ?
and ... ... very , very few people make archbishop .
no , ash ...
... you probably couldn' t do it .
maybe if murphy were here ...
thanks .
be seeing you .
how did you find me ?
seek and ye shall find .
anyway , i think it' s me that you need .
real meat ... ... real vegetables ... ... rice ...
yours is a lucky dog .
he eats better than people do .
real alcohol ... ... cigarettes ...
... wisdom you can' t get from a terminal .
all the fruits of avalon ... ... the privilege of a solo player .
but for the best players , the game becomes its own reward .
i' ve checked you out .
stunner ?
the ability to analyze data ... ... is one of a bishop' s most important skills .
you were a warrior in wizard .
when it dissolved , many people speculated as to why .
the details remain a mystery ... ... but there are those who say ... ... a certain warrior ignored her orders ... ... and called ' reset ' .
ash . !
can you hear me ?
shoot at the cockpit . !
what' s wrong , ash ?
answer me . !
someone gets soared ... ... the party loses its point person and gets wiped out .
happens all the time .
the only strange thing ... ... was that it happened to the invincible wizard .
i want to form a party with you .
the standard six members .
three warriors , a good thief ... ... and a mage , if possible .
is that all ?
you' re not going to ask about me ?
would you tell me ?
inside avalon i will .
be in flak tower 22 ... ... tomorrow at midnight .
i' d like to close .
i' m meeting someone at midnight who can take me to class special a.
there' s no such thing , you know .
not inside avalon .
no matter how real it seems , avalon is just a game .
but a program you can' t clear ... ... isn' t a game any more .
that' s why it' s hidden away ... ... a forbidden field .
who are you ?
bishop scouted me , too .
as a terminal manager , not as a player .
who is ' bishop ' ?
it' s no use trying to track him down .
he doesn' t access from a branch .
he has his own terminal .
he just shows up in the game .
can you do that ?
sure you can .
with enough money and equipment , it' s no problem .
take my advice .
keep away from him .
i can' t .
why not ?
murphy' s in special a.
so that' s it ...
take room 9 .
the game master' s waiting .
thanks .
i' ve input your coordinates .
i' d prefer you didn' t go to special a , though ...
i' m sorry .
a good game master ... ... does not intervene .
let me ask you something ...
are you accessing from a terminal somewhere ... ... or are you part of the system itself ?
what does it matter ?
you couldn' t confirm that anyway .
all right .
begin .
thanks for your help .
don' t thank me .
this team was neoessary .
did you find out about me ?
you' re one of the nine sisters , rulers of avalon ... ... designers of the program .
i' m a bishop .
a successor to the apostles .
i' m not responsible for its creation .
but you' re not a player .
you' re on their side .
would you like to be ?
i don' t trust myself to join them .
there' s no need to join their party .
they' re just ciphers .
nothing but a mass of data .
ash ...
one you think you can clear but can' t ... ... or one that looks impossible but isn' t .
finding that subtle balance ... ... and maintaining it up through all the levels ... ... is our side' s job .
right .
it looks like we' re all here .
let' s move out .
nice to be working with you again .
no response from up ahead .
i don ' t like it ...
ash ... go up top .
makanito , zilwan , badi ... forward .
shit !
it' s a bloody citadel !
of all the goddamn luck !
settle down .
it' s a class a strength opponent , but it has a weak point .
the cannons will get us if we attack head on ...
ash ... ... we' il get out in front and stop it .
you get behind it and aim at the grill .
damn it , bishop !
are you trying to wipe out your front line ? !
they' re just dummies created by the program . !
forget them !
move !
don' t wait around !
where are you , ghost ?
stunner !
i screwed up again ...
and this chance never comes twice ...
i' m just not very lucky .
' again ' ?
you saw her .
the ghost ...
your chance comes when she leaves the wall .
get the ghost ... ... and you open the gate to special a.
say hello to murphy .
it wasn' t your fault that wizard got wiped out .
the one who ran ... was me .
i wanted to tell murphy that .
ash !
hurry .
the ghost won' t wait for you .
just as i thought ... you' re the only one who got through the gate .
is this ' special a ' ?
we call it ' class real ' .
bulldlng it has taken huge amounts of very sophlstlcated data .
in many ways , it' s still very experlmental .
' in many ways ' ?
there ' s just one thing you have to do to complete it .
finish off the unreturned .
your equipment and skill parameters are ... ... returned to default .
all you have is a pistol ... ... and one clip of ammunition .
there are neutral characters operating under free will .
hurt one of them and your game is over .
there' s no time limit .
the only exit from the game is completlon .
if you get back safely ... ... you can be one of us .
any questlons ?
why did you send me here ?
surely the answer to that lles within you .
if there are no questions , we' il begln .
look behind you .
he ' il be there .
fight well , ash .
' avalon , faraway isle of legend ...
' ... of apple groves and mist ...
' avalon , when will that day come ?
' isle of faery , where heroes go ... '
why did you come ?
because of me ?
isn' t that a good reason ?
you know why wizard broke up .
i thought i did .
that' s why i kept my mouth shut .
i let them think i oalled ' reset ' .
so why did you come here ? !
stunner told me you were lost .
back there , you' re just another ' unreturned ' .
you wanted to go all the way .
we were too complacent .
we were in your way .
none of us wanted to break up the party .
we were invincible .
everyone else envied us .
all the more reason ... ... you needed a pretext to dissolve it .
but is this what you wanted ?
did you abandon us ... ... to spend your life as a vegetable in a hospital bed ?
do i look like a vegetable to you ?
remember , this is ' class real ' .
reality is nothing but an obsession that takes hold of us !
why shouldn' t i make this into my reality ?
you tell yourself that , but all you' re doing is running away .
i don' t want to argue !
have you noticed what color your hair is ?
where' s that beautiful silver streak ... ... that makes them call you ' ash ' ?
have you ever been shot ?
do you want to feel real pain in a real body ?
does it have to be this way ?
when one of us dies ... ... and that body doesn' t vanish ...
... the other one will know .
' ... so many of the brave are cut down ...
' ... and heroes lay fallen .
' as bright , shining death approaohes ...
' ... the spectres appear ...
' ... and shroud them in darkness ...
' ... as black night desoends .
ash ...
don' t let appearances confuse you .
this is the world ... ... where you belong .
' avalon , the heroes set out ...
' ... for that isle of legend ...
' avalon , isle of spirits ...
' avalon , heaven of shadows ...
' now , with the nine sisters ...
' ... across the misty water ...
' ... the ship sets sail ...
' ... to avalon . '
