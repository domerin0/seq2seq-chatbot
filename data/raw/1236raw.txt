anita hans " sunk 120 miles outside maroco .
they' ve gotten carla , in geneva .
we found that the usual way .
it s been taken care of by our legal department .
why they arrested her ?
she was carrying 150 grams of heroin .
they probably used her as a bate .
except she' s ... she' s ... what ?
i m not gonna think the worst scenario .
while they were bothering with her arrest , someone passed 3 kilos of that .
where is colonel grace ?
on a mission .
take some days off .
you worth it .
just let us know where you are all the time .
everything is gonna be all right .
congratulations for the mission . one more time .
it was really successful .
are you ok ?
need anything ?
can i stay for some days in your apartment ?
you have any kinda problems ?
i il get you out of here .
it s clear you' ve been a victim of a really bad joke .
150 grams of heroin sound like a really bad joke to you ?
you have no criminal record .
you' ve been vacating in maroco with your husband .
you' ve never had any troubles .
you' re not taking drugs , it' s gonna come up at the blood tests .
not even the worst lawyer , would loose your case .
how long will this take ?
not that much .
i m already working on your papers .
i ve found out how similar cases were handled .
so ?
seven releases so far .
don' t you worry .
we' re right beside you .
it s me , i must see you .
i m here all the time .
how' s loik ?
i cannot find him anywhere .
he' s probably on vacations .
i m coming by .
go .
we' il take care of it .
that' s good news .
i talked to some people facing the same charges as you .
you won' t be staying here much .
and what does that mean ?
your employer wants you to do something , while you' re here .
i m just carrying out the message to you .
her name is helena standler .
works for lipofski .
she was to be released next week .
you must kill her .
did the office plant the drugs into my suitcase ?
i m just carrying out the message .
tell them , they can go to hell .
the police might go over to your .
they can find 10 kilos of heroin there .
i won' t be able to help then .
you' il go to jail for 20 years at least . think of your parents .
don' t bring my parents into this shit , you fucking asshole .
ok .
excuse me .
i wanna get some sleep .
i know .
why they didn' t just say it , from the beginning ?
helena standler works in the jail hospital .
she' s got a good reputation , but you better be very careful with her .
everything is gonna be all right , you' il see .
so ?
there was an american agent inside " anita hans " .
that' s why they killed ramond .
we totally ignored them in maroco .
we drawn one of their own , so they had to kill one of our own .
we bothered them and not it came back to us .
will they stop here ?
they' re out of the game .
they worry about other shit .
i m worried about george .
first it was ramond , now lisa .
i don' t know what you' re planning on doing, but i just don' t want him around .
i il find a new mission for him, somewhere far away .
ramond was drown at aspreto .
allright ?
very well .
we' re done .
hi .
i can' t find the colonel .
they' re sending me to train the commandos in sourinam .
trainer ... they can count on me .
loik , i need a favor .
just don' t bother me with the office .
in everything else , i totally trust you .
george, what brings you here ?
i il ask directly .
did you fraimed lisa ?
double corbonatted soda . helps breathing skin .
cleans the toxines . wanna give it try ?
for lisa , it was just orders to be followed .
why ?
they had to get her .
i don' t care about the rest .
you don' t ?
you know why we sunk that boat ?
your whole life you' ve been tricking people . now it was your turn .
lf you wanted to have rules , being a secret agent was a mistake .
ramond is dead .
i did' t know that .
we had to expect that from the americans .
it was a woman that killed him .
about i. 65 tall , blond with short hair .
you know maria menendez ?
you should .
she' s spanish , independent .
she has contacts with the americans .
we' ve spotted her at maroco with the guy at the embassy .
she works for whomever pays the most . interested ?
she lives in madrid .
i il give her a place to live, if you want her . with great pleasure .
you ain' t knocking, you may as well close the damn door .
you wanted to see me ?
not me .
go to the first floor .
they are waiting for your report and your passport .
you haven' t delivered yet .
i don' t have it on me .
your mission was over in our last meeting .
you know what happens when someone oversees our rules .
what is that ? a threat ?
a warning .
i m working here a long time , so i know what' s going on .
i don' t even know who you are .
so don' t go threatening me .
they want me to take care some woman in jail .
she' s being released in 4 days .
helena standler . you know her ?
no .
she' s highly ranked in lipofski' s organization .
why we won' t wait for her to be released ?
it would be simpler .
i don' t get that either, but i don' t have any choice .
you shouldn' t be here .
stop .
when are you gonna see a lawyer ?
do not get in trouble because of me .
hold on .
good evening .
espresso , please
thanks .
give me a cigarette .
cleansing and bandaging .
the pictures are from a motion sensitive camera .
switzerland is full of those .
that' s him .
police gathered three burned bodies .
you supposed to send him somewhere far away .
what is he doing in switzerland ?
he' s alive .
seems so , but i m not sure if we must be happy about it .
what' s his game ?
is he interested in lisa ?
he' s feeling betrayed .
you' re underestimating him .
is he or is he not a professional ?
disobedience means betrayal .
you know that .
i have to pay the price .
we all have to .
it s me .
may i come in ?
thank you .
may i use the printer ?
over there .
can you bring the package i ve left you ?
i m off to bed .
does it hurt ?
no .
thank you .
perfect .
dizitalin .
powerfull , hearttonic ... bad also deadly for the healthy .
standler has the heart of a teenage girl .
me too .
i can have some too .
they' ve thought about that for sure .
and ?
they' re taking that risk .
they trust you .
why you are so afraid ?
it s me , loik .
i hope you didn' t do anything stupid .
i m glad you' re here .
i wanted to talk to you .
three days ago none wanted to talk to me .
what' s happening ?
you didn' t inform neither loik of myself .
ain' t that a bit unusual ?
swiss newspapers have intersting subjects .
he know lipofski and all of a sudden he wants to give him away .
he became a burdon .
to whom ?
what do u expect ?
geopolitical lesson ?
law is the secret .
you can' t be sensitive about it .
it s just a job .
we wanted lipofski in africa , but he got stubborn .
we had to proove to him that we' re not joking .
we can' t allow to standler or noone else to ruin everything .
jail was your idea ?
i love lisa too much .
she' s not gonna have any problems .
and if she' s not cooperative ?
we asked her to obey , not to cooperate .
lately you seem that you can' t see the difference between those two .
what' s your problem ?
ethical ? idealistic ?
you had no second thoughts in killing that girl in madrid .
for the time being i ve blocked the investigation .
i wonder myself if there is any point in all these .
we all came to wonder that sometime .
but there is one thing i m certain of .
i wouldn' t change this for the world .
i m talkin as a friend . there is a mission waiting for you .
it s not a fake one .
you have my word .
congratulations .
you did an excellent job .
come with me .
i il tell you something important .
you' il always be alone . that' s the way it has to be, for an agent .
it s not a matter of courage only .
it s a matter of self preservation .
jump .
it s too high .
jump lisa .
you can do it .
otherwise you wouldn' t be here .
jump .
why there' s nothing left of my country ?
you should' ve stayed there .
what' s wrong with her ?
her son died some days ago .
she just found out .
i il talk to her .
no .
come on, helena .
you want a glass of water ?
yes, please .
here you are .
thanks .
we can' t stay here all night .
bank of kuweit , luxemburg .
you french people are so expensive .
less expensive then you american people .
we don' t mess in your business .
money is the essence of war .
i would be helping sick children .
mother teresa , dressed up in armani .
what' s you gonna do with your agent and my troublemaker ?
you' re gonna keep them ?
we are ready .
dasilve is tougher then me while working .
like a libanese man . and now he has taken charge of the whole country .
we' re not businessmen .
we' re deplomats .
ain' t that the same thing ?
lipofski . they' re here .
do you speak portuguese ?
a few .
nice . talk to him in english . he prefers that .
come with me .
about that ...
noone will be waiting for her once she goes out of jail .
