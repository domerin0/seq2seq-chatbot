what secret ?
the recipe for coca cola .
look , the kind you like .
yeah , change the ...
what did you eat today ?
nothing , that' s my problem , i' m starved !
it' s funny when you ask them what they value most in a man .
i like him to be intelligent , to be honest , to be kind ...
it' s all shit !
you' d have problems lf you were like me .
not that again !
you aren' t ugly .
anybody would like to have your face .
you' re normal .
normal !
that doesn' t mean i' m handsome .
you' re handsome .
i' m acceptable , when you' re not beside me .
you' re like anorexics .
they insist they' re fat , and end up crazy .
when some girl ties you down , the rest of us will get a chance .
yeah , yeah .
why not ?
lf you meet the right girl ...
she doesn' t exist .
shit !
how did i miss that ?
god punished you .
you' re for lt .
who are you saying that to ?
to god
do you believe in god ?
don' t start all that shit .
i just asked a question .
lf you don' t want to , don' t answer .
i don' t believe in god .
how do you explain what happened ?
how do you mean ?
your face .
there is no explanation .
i believe there is .
you believe i' m mad .
i only believe what i see .
you haven' t let me see your face yet .
and i won' t .
do you really think you' re a monster , csar ?
come on , let me see .
stick your hand up your ass !
take it easy , brat !
i' m sick of all your stories !
leave me alone !
i' il kick that shit out of you !
leave me alone !
i can' t work with you in here .
leave us on our own .
on my responsibility .
you' re just a spoilt brat , who ...
my parents are dead , asshole !
you made up a story so as not to admit what you did .
is that true ?
what ?
that you' re a spoilt brat .
my father had a restaurant chain .
that' s not my fault .
when did your parents die ?
15 years ago , ... ... in an accident .
and now you' re rich .
so they say .
then why don' t you want a lawyer ?
they say they can get me the best .
but they want me stuck here forever .
who are they ?
my partners .
they' ve been suckling my blood since i was a kid .
now they' ve got everything .
they' ve cut me out .
it wasn' t them .
it was me .
i don' t care .
let' s see , csar .
do you know why you' re here ?
because i wear a mask , i guess .
no .
because you killed someone .
or don' t you remember ?
tell me , don' t you remember ?
fuck , stop it !
we must get things clear lf you want us to get on .
i don' t want us to get on !
is your solution to sit in this hole and not talk ?
aren' t we talking now ?
after two months .
i' ve been trying for two months .
read the reports .
i' ve read them .
i want you to tell me , lf possible , slitting on a char .
or are you going to stay there ?
i like the floor .
it' s the only thing that seems real .
what does everything else seem ?
everything else is a lie .
all this seems a lie .
including you .
you don' t even wear a white coat .
do you think i should ?
doctors wear them .
i took it off so you' d forget i was a doctor .
so that you' d like me more .
it didn' t work .
i hate the sight of you .
now that we' re friends , ...
i' ve got no friends . ... tell me what happened .
the sooner you talk , the sooner i' il go .
hey !
happy birthday and all the things people usually say .
thank you , thank you .
where did you find her ?
in the library .
she tried to steal my book .
it was mine .
anyway ...
csar , sofa .
hello .
happy birthday .
thank you .
your present .
thanks a lot .
we bought it between us .
then i have to thank both of you .
stop chatting her up and open lt .
i' d rather open them tomorrow .
whatever .
like a drink ?
sure .
i' il leave this upstairs .
hello .
what are you doling here ?
happy birthday , darling .
thank you .
but i didn' t ask you to the party .
that was nice of you .
i brought you a present too .
why not open it ?
no , thanks .
i already know what' s inside .
and last night ?
listen , nuria .
i don' t like you just turning up , much less coming into my room .
well !
do i have to apologize ?
no .
you have to go .
right , i know what it is .
you don' t want to be seen twice with the same girl .
it would run your reputation .
you got it in one .
and there' s someone else .
right .
who ?
the brunette you were talking to a minute ago ?
well , she' s not bad .
i don' t care .
i don' t need to be seen with you .
hold me .
come on .
a little kiss .
come on .
until when ?
until next friday ?
can you manage a weekend without me ?
excuse me , i must see to my guests .
yes , the brunette will take time .
she looks that type .
that type ?
yes .
the kind who can' t find your zipper .
hello .
hello .
what did you want ?
to open this .
walt .
i' il serve you .
since when are you the waiter ?
don' t you know i' m in catering ?
are you all right ?
can you tell i' m elbowing in ?
a bit .
i' ve got a slight problem .
a girl' s chasing me .
you don' t say .
i need some help to get rid of her .
and i' m that help .
shit , there she is !
where ?
don' t look , don' t look .
look over here .
that' s lt .
yes .
yes , yes , yes .
here we are .
here we are .
well ...
act as if we were talking about something real interesting .
nod your head , agree , say yes .
you know .
what a nice conversation .
yes .
and she' s coming this way .
fuck !
what are you doing ?
don' t worry , i' il guide you .
straight on .
i don' t see her .
here it is .
go right in .
i' m not going in there .
well , i am .
so long .
he' s in here .
you ... !
well ...
we' re safe .
but we' ve got nothing to drink here .
i think all you really want is to chat me up .
yes , that too .
first , i want to save my skin .
can' t you say you aren' t interested ?
she wouldn' t care .
she never gets tired .
she must be feeling bad .
yeah .
of course .
so you' re studying drama , like pelayo ?
for now .
scenography ?
acting .
really ?
to be an actress ?
i am an actress .
is that a problem ?
yes .
aren' t you ashamed ?
ashamed ?
why should i be ashamed ?
actors aren' t honest .
you' re able to show emotions you don' t have , ... ... or which , at most , you invent .
right now , you could be thinking , ... ... " this guy' s a real drag .
how can i dump him ?
really ?
" and in catering .
a pain in the ass .
but you' re a good actress , it doesn' t show .
hey , pelayo !
i caught you .
come in .
how' s it going ?
great .
i' m a bit out of it now .
drunk , you mean .
why are you in here ?
sofa was protecting me from a female psychopath out there .
she seemed dangerous .
yeah .
what about you ?
i was drinking .
women don' t chase after me .
we' re out of drink .
here .
shit .
i' il get some more .
for all of us .
well ...
i guess i' il be going .
but why ?
i' ve drunk too much and i don' t feel well .
don' t be stupid , it' s just starting .
for you , it is .
pelayo .
you can' t go .
you' re my guest of honor .
you' re a son of a bitch , csar .
why d' you say that ?
the party' s full of girls .
i go for a piss , you start talking to her , and ...
what ?
nothing .
and i look like an asshole .
tell me what' s wrong .
why do you have to chat up sofa ?
no one' s chatting up sofa .
yeah , and i' m blind , right ?
you' re certainly drunk .
i' m drunk , but i' il tell you this .
i like sofa .
a hell of a lot .
she may even be the girl of my dreams .
but if she fucks up our friendship , she can go to hell .
i feel the same .
sure .
pelayo , where are you going ?
home .
already ?
yeah , i' m wrecked .
i' il come with you .
don' t bother .
you stay .
are you going too ?
i have to get up early .
i can run you home later .
stay on , i' m leaving you in good hands .
what' s wrong with him ?
he' s drunk .
is he annoyed with us ?
no .
you sure ?
she doesn' t look too happy .
didn' t you have to get up early ?
i' m doing too much for you tonight .
maybe it means something .
yeah , that you' ve got a nerve .
it' s just for a minute .
long enough for my friend nuria to admit defeat .
this is my place .
don' t dare laugh at lt .
why would i laugh ?
it' s nothing special , but it' s cheap .
do you like clowns ?
they' re not clowns .
they' re mime artists .
pancho !
i' ve got a cat .
i hate cats .
they' re almost as false as actresses .
says the caterer .
how do you pay for this ?
do your parents help ?
do you work ?
he' s real nosy , isn' t he , pancho ?
i' m an arms dealer .
fancy that !
i always wanted to know how arms dealers lived .
now you do .
how can i explain it to you ?
you wouldn' t understand .
even i don' t understand .
she was making coffee and i started snooping around .
suddenly , i got that stupid feeling a lot of people get .
well , i like lt .
what dld you feel ?
that i loved her .
god , i' m even embarrassed to say lt .
i didn' t hear you .
i said i like your place .
and i like yours .
let' s swap .
you wouldn' t like it tomorrow morning .
i said it because of the decor .
your place is more ...
more personal .
and warmer .
warmer ?
yes .
you think my house is cold ?
a bit .
and am l ?
i don' t know .
you said my house seemed cold .
lf you' re waiting for me to list your virtues , hard luck .
you think you' re real smart .
maybe .
well , you' re wrong .
i don' t need you to list my virtues .
no , i' m sure you know what they are .
but you' d like me to see them too .
so you say .
i' m not going to argue about lt .
just as well .
you' d lose .
oh , yeah ?
but i don' t want to argue either .
i propose we do the opposite .
we don' t argue ?
we show our defects .
great !
i hope you' re being fair .
this is absolutely you .
well , mine is finished .
fuck !
that' s how you see me ?
did i go too far ?
sign lt .
let' s see mine .
it' s lovely !
it' s not a caricature .
you see .
you draw beautifully .
i' il sell it to you .
miser .
how much ?
as it' s you , .... ... i' il settle for ... ... a kiss .
that smile is going to kill me !
it would be wrong lf we did anything tonight .
why ?
pelayo .
remember ?
your best friend .
he doesn' t have to find out .
besides , he' d do the same .
i see friendship really matters to you .
it does .
that' s why i wouldn' t tell him .
some people ... ... say that they would be happy with a normal life span .
but " normal " means different things , depending on ...
what are you looking at ?
i' m watching tv .
i ... the romans , for instance , llvedonly25years .
today , ... ... that figure has tripled , which means that ...
what the fuck is he on about ?
i saw this before .
it' s about cryonlzatlon .
cryo what ?
when they freeze you or something .
like walt disney .
wow , that' s cold !
hey , you !
there won' t be a landslide .
it isn' t dangerous , the ground is firm here , and very solid .
are you leaving ?
going home .
here' s my number .
but i' il call tomorrow .
what for ?
all right , i won' t call .
csar .
what is it ?
come here .
i want to tell you a secret .
come here .
hello , darling .
did you follow me ?
of course ... ... l didn' t .
but i had the feeling we' d meet .
how was the brunette ?
great .
why ?
from your face , i' d say you didn' t sleep with her .
let me guess .
you didn' t sleep with her , but you don' t mind .
you have all the time in the world ... ... for that .
and i bet you' re seeing her tomorrow .
brilliant .
aren' t l ?
there' s more .
well ?
i scored at the party too .
but he wasn' t up to lt .
so i' m still hot for lt .
and ?
and until you meet up again ... ... with your miss universe , you could have fun .
no , i think i prefer to go home and sleep .
come on , csar .
it' s your birthday .
skip it , i' m going home .
what' s up , csar ?
are you scared ?
want some of this ?
no , thanks .
sure , act the innocent now .
i don' t need that to enjoy myself .
i can see that .
that' s not a good idea .
do what you want .
what' s happiness for you ?
what ?
for me , this is happiness .
being here with you .
what about you ?
i can' t handle heavy conversations right now .
your thoughts are somewhere else , right ?
maybe .
one thing really bothers me .
what ?
you know nothing about me .
except my name' s nuria and i' m a good fuck .
two important things .
you don' t know my address or my number .
we have to start somewhere .
i' m going to see your house now .
it' s not far .
tell me something .
do you believe in god ?
hello .
hello .
how are you ?
you got home all right ?
yeah .
well , i had a horrible dream .
that you never saw me again .
yes !
i come out of your house , go to my car , ... ... and that crazy bitch has been following me .
who , that nuria ?
yes .
she comes over and says , " want a lift ?
she goes on so much i don' t know how to say no .
so i get in the car , she drives faster and faster , ... ... and kills herself .
with me inside .
that' s horrible .
but the worst part ... ... is that my face is completely destroyed , ... ... like " the phantom of the opera " .
i couldn' t wake up .
i was a monster .
you' re a monster anyway .
oh , yeah ?
yeah .
i' m a monster too .
look .
how was your house ?
was anyone left ?
left where ?
in your house .
there was a party , remember ?
a party ?
dreaming is shit .
that dream was nice .
a park , children playing , a girl who loves you .
that' s why .
then you wake up and you want to die .
at first , i didn' t even have the strength to react .
i' d been in a coma for three weeks .
you were lucky .
you could have died , like nuria .
what if i had ?
it would' ve been better .
did you see her body ?
i never did .
you think she didn' t die ?
i' m like you .
i only believe what i see .
csar , show me your face , please .
what for ?
look .
it' s true you had an accident .
it' s true ... ... you were disfigured , but not any more .
take that off .
the doctors fixed you .
they didn' t have a fucking clue !
in the accident you didn' t lose just skin and some muscle .
the blow was so severe it caused a multiple fracture of the skull .
we secured the osseous structure with metal wires , ... ... and , over that , we reinserted the muscles ... ... we could still retrieve .
yes , very nice , but i know all that .
i' ve had it explained to me 150 times .
but you never say when you' il operate .
i' ve been waiting two months .
but we' ve operated three times .
i wouldn' t call that an operation .
i' d call it ...
well ...
i don' t know what i' d call lt .
the symmetry isn' t perfect , ... ... but what we' ve done with your face is , if i may say so ... ... a craftsman' s job ..
we can' t work on skin which is pure scars .
no , no , there must be some way .
what ?
" what ?
you' re the doctors , aren' t you ?
a transplant , whatever !
there' s a problem with fibrosis .
lf we operate again , ... ... we may just cause further damage .
we' d need millimetric precision , ... ... and today , that' s impossible
let' s look at this .
i' m not an idiot .
today , people change their breasts .
they have hair implants .
they even change their skin color .
are you saying that on the threshold of the year 2, 000 ... ... you can' t do a simple operation and sort out this ... ... this fuck up ?
it isn' t so simple , csar .
remember ...
don' t patronize me !
stop treating me like a child !
i' m not just any patient .
and this isn' t a welfare hospital .
i' m willing to pay any amount .
you' re in charge .
they say you' re the best in your field .
well , invent something , experiment on me .
i' ve seen patients who' ve lost all their features , ... ... who can' t even talk .
at least , you can look yourself in the eye .
what good is that ?
every time i look in the mirror i want to die .
your case isn' t so serious .
just learn to accept lt .
and who' il accept me ?
will you explain to the people who look at me in the street ?
will you tell them that looks aren' t important ?
that beauty is on the inside ?
we' d like to show you something .
what is this ?
a facial prosthesis .
we use it in extreme cases of rejection , like yours .
this is shit !
it' s not the best solution .
but it' s all we can do for the moment .
i want a face !
not a mask !
we don' t work miracles .
that' s what the bastard said .
but in the end , they did .
did what ?
work a miracle .
so it seems .
so it seems ?
things are or they aren' t .
did they do it or not ?
i' m tired .
why don' t you go ?
i' il be back on tuesday .
want anything ?
no .
all right .
see you on tuesday .
a pad and a pencil .
but don' t tell them .
i don' t want to owe them anything .
have i changed so much ?
because i recognize you .
how are you ?
how are you ?
you' re playing a part now , but i don' t know what .
your lips are smiling , ...
... but your eyes are trembling .
what ?
you' re really very good .
as an actress .
i asked how you were .
you needn' t answer .
i' m alive .
how should i be ?
and i' m tired .
tired of waiting for you to call , ... ... even to say , " tough luck " .
i was busy .
bullshit !
i was afraid you' d feel uncomfortable if i rang .
you were afraid you' d feel uncomfortable .
afraid you couldn' t look me in the face .
like now .
that' s not true .
i' ve often dreamed of this moment .
what moment ?
the moment we' d meet again .
in my dream we were just like this .
here , ... ... in the park .
although , ... ... something was different .
what ?
it wasn' t raining .
i have to go , csar .
what are you doing tomorrow night ?
studying .
i' m very busy .
it' s friday , we could meet .
i' ve got a lot to do .
all right , so long .
csar !
we' il meet if you want .
lf you want .
as soon as there is the slightest possibility of death , ... ... the stabilization and transport team goes into action .
once the client is declared legally dead , ... ... he is put into a maintenance capsule ... ... and the transport legalities are sorted out .
in the storeroom in arizona , in the u. s. a. , ... ... a team of specialists prepare the body for final freezing .
among other measures , ... ... blood is replaced by a solution which conserves the organs .
finally , ... ... the client is put in the capsule ... ... where he will remain until medicine can reanimate him .
to be honest , i' d have to think it over .
it' s hard to accept the idea .
how should we view it ?
we are , undoubtedly , ... ... facing a major development , ... ... a new challenge for humanity .
it' s understandable that the first reaction is rejection .
we have now got the means to do lt .
we' ve got the technology .
but , above all , ... ... we have sufficient moral maturity ... ... to understand what this new step means ... ... for human evolution , to look at the future ... ... and put an end to certain meaningless taboos , ... ... inherited from ancient religions , ... ... old and useless memories .
thank you for speaking to us .
and thank you to our audience ...
hl .
hl .
what' s that ?
shit , isn' t it ?
but they suggested i wear it , in case of infection .
well , kid .
what' re you up to ?
arguing with doctors all day .
you should go out more .
i' m trying .
what' re you having ?
rum and coke , you want one ?
yes .
i' il get you one .
i' m going to the bathroom .
take that off .
why ?
don' t you realize you won' t be able to hide your face ?
i told you , it' s to stop infections .
sure .
lf you' re embarrassed , just go .
nobody asked you to come .
sofia did .
what ?
she didn' t want to be alone with you .
why not ?
you' re giving her a hard time .
i' m having a hard time .
talk to a psychologist , or to me .
don' t take it out on a girl you met once .
did she say that ?
did she say that ?
bitch !
come back !
whiskey and coke .
what whiskey ?
what did you say ?
what whiskey ?
why don' t you ask me to my face , son of a bitch ?
ballantine' s .

pelayo went to look for you .
and i came to look for you .
why ?

no reason .
to ... ... buy you a drink .

the thing is , ... ... i' ve got a problem .
a girl' s chasing me , ... ... and i need some help to get rid of her .

she' s coming this way .
don' t look , don' t look .

i mean , as if i were here .

what a lovely conversation we' re having .
so that' s it , here we are .
having a bit of a chat about life .

well , this is where i leave you .
i' il see you home .
no , i live very close .
i' ve got the motor bike .

lay off , pelayo .
she wants to go on her own .
shut up , you' re drunk .
i might be drunk , but i' m not an idiot .
anyway , i' m not drunk .
really , you needn' t bother .
as you wish .
you' re the one who' s drunk .
we' il call you to meet some other day .
all right , we could go to the moles .
you hear ?

well , that' s it , then .
no , don' t kiss me .
you might get poisoned by my drunken breath .
well ...
we' il meet up soon .
sure .
we' il meet up soon .
it' s not cold .
well ...
i' m gonna have to go .
where are you going ?
i' ve just remembered my bike is back here .
i' il go with you .

pelayo .
walt a minute .

i don' t know .
you drank too much .
we' il talk tomorrow if you want .
tomorrow , i' il wish i were dead .
you won' t .
you just need to rest .
pelayo !
you' re my best friend .
son of a bitch !
open your eyes .
csar .
it' s me .
sofa !
what are you doing here ?
forgive me .
why ?
i love you .
come on .
what' s wrong ?
nothing .
i still can' t believe this is really happening .
where' s pelayo ?
i don' t know .
he went with you , didn' t he ?
yes .
of course .
come on .
god , what a sensation !
of what ?
do you ever feel you' ve lived something before ?
yes .
why is that ?
they say it' s a lapse in the bran .
i' ve been here before .
it usually goes away after a few seconds .
i don' t want it to go away .
you' ve made use of your time .
that' s all there is here .
very pretty .
is it sofa ?
how much longer will i be here ?
no one ever knows that .
even my worst nightmare was never like this place .
it' s a psychiatric penitentiary .
no more , no less .
i shouldn' t be here .
you' re accused of murder .
i don' t even know what i did .
tell me something .
does the name ally mean anything to you ?
all ...
you know a girl with that name ?
no .
why do you ask ?
it seems you kept repeating it last night .
i guess i was dreaming .
what did you dream ?
i can' t remember .
it could be important .
how could it be important ?
look , i can prove you didn' t know what you were doing , ... ... but first i have to find some explanation for all this .
there is no explanation .
i told you the other day .
what did you dream , csar ?
i don' t know .
i only remember bits .
first , i' m in a kind of office .
a secretary shows me into another office .
there , there' s a photo of a sunset and a man .
then ...
i don' t know .
they show me lots of papers .
what papers ?
i don' t know .
but i sign them .
does the office belong to your company ?
no , i don' t recognize lt .
you dreamed of a place you' d never been ?
yes .
that happens a lot , doesn' t it ?
are they the papers ... ... you signed with the doctors ?
no , what happened with the doctors was surreal .
why ?
one day they rang me ... ... to go to the hospital .
when i arrived , the whole surgical team was waiting .
for months , ... ... those faces had looked at me with indifference ... ... and impotence .
now they were all smiles .
the same bastard who had said my case was hopeless ... ... started talking about some operation .
they had a new revolutionary system in the clinic now .
they said that within two weeks ... ... my face would be completely reconstructed .
you didn' t believe them ?
no , not at first .
i thought it was just a way to get more money out of me .
but they showed me all the gadgets for the operation .
it looked like science fiction .
all i could see were cables , switches , monitors .
actually , i never really knew what they were going to do .
but i thought i' d nothing to lose .
those people were used to rhino plastics , ... ... liposuctions , hair transplants , ... ... but my operation was much more .
in less than a week , ... ... my life had turned around .
one night , i was lying on the ground , drunk , ... ... wanting to die .
the next morning , my dreams were coming true , ... ... like in the movies .
sofa loved me , and the doctors found the miracle cure .
i don' t know .
obviously , i was suspicious .
suspicious ?
of whom ?
of what ?
i don' t know .
in life , you never know .
happiness comes when you least expect lt .
i once knew a guy who was alone in the world .
suddenly , he was married with two daughters .
fuck , you' ve got a strange idea of happiness .
well , that depends on the individual .
what' s happiness for you ?
what' s happiness for you ?
don' t ask any more stupid questions .
but at that time you were happy .
or weren' t you ?
so what ?
my life now is shit .
all i can do is eat , shit , sleep , ... ... and dream of my memories .
it' s good that you remember .
well ?
well , what ?
they were to remove the plates today .
and they did .
and ?
well , my ears are where they should be .
csar , don' t scare me .
take off the plates .
you do lt .
how did they do it ?
walt .
just to say ... ... that i love you .
you' re going too fast , ... ... considering we met yesterday .
yesterday ?
my birthday , don' t you remember ?
i met an incredible girl .
her name was sofa .
but today i woke up feeling great , ... ... and now i' m with the girl again .
what is it ?
what is it ?
lf you want me to move , you have to put in a coin .
ting !
we never appreciate the good moments till they' re over .
maybe that' s why they' re good moments .
we don' t stop to think about them .
perhaps .
what happened to pelayo ?
what' s up ?
hang on a minute .
that' s lt .
about time .
want anything else ?
no , thanks .
how' s things , pelayo ?
fine .
how' s things , pelayo ?
fine .
yeah .
i' m actually not as fucked up as i look .
i' m used to you always winning , you bastard .
and sofa isn' t that great .
you said she was ideal .
really ?
i was drunk .
anyway , we' re friends .
bastard !
what' s that on your face ?
what ?
fuck , there' s a seam opening !
what are you on about ?
you fucking idiot !
what' s the matter ?
i hate dreaming .
you' re tickling me .
what' s wrong ?
what is it ?
where' s sofa ?
what ?
what have you done with sofa ?
i am sofa .
you bitch !
you' re mad .
you' re mad .
where is she ?
in one minute , i' m going to call the police .
you' il be in trouble lf sofa doesn' t appear .
so you survived the accident .
what accident ?
whose body was it ?
i didn' t have an accident .
no .
it wasn' t an accident .
it was attempted murder .
a pity you didn' t see my face , bitch !
why are you doing this ?
how have i changed ?
you haven' t .
you' re the same lunatic who gate crashed my party .
i' m the girl you made love to just now .
i' m sofa .
stop saying you' re sofa , do you hear ?
don' t say her name !
you won' t tell me where she is .
you never will .
csar ...
i love you .
hello .
hello .
you can go , i' il see to this .
right .
let me get this clear .
where were you last night ?
at home .
i told that gentleman .
at home .
with whom ?
with a girl .
the girl i just questioned ?
no , that' s another girl .
i was with sofa .
the girl i spoke to was sofa .
yes , that' s what she says , but it' s a lie .
who is she then ?
she' s ...
nuria .
nuria ?
nuria what ?
i don' t know .
she never told me her surname .
let' s see .
you were at home with a girl called sofa , and suddenly ...
i go to the bathroom , come back , and she' s in sofia' s place .
where' s sofa ?
ask nuria , she' s pretending to be her .
you don' t know her surname ?
but who do you believe , her or me ?
listen , that girl' s papers are all in order .
we' ve let her go .
you' ve what ?
and i assure you she' s called sofa .
sofa cueto , and she lives at number 2 , qulrs st.
no !
no , what ?
well , yes , but that' s another girl .
i know the real sofa .
then tell me where she is .
because , legally , ... ... the girl you' re talking about ... ... only exists in your imagination .
i don' t believe this .
and another thing , ... ... the girl looks as if she' d been hit .
she was in my house , supplanting my girlfriend !
i don' t know why , ... ... but she wouldn' t press charges .
fucking great !
so now she' s the victim !
tell me .
are you on drugs ?
god !
we do know ... ... you were under psychiatric care .
my face was destroyed in a car crash she caused !
your face looks fine .
because ...
it doesn' t matter .
i' ve got nothing more to say .
young man ...
i' d advise you to see a psychiatrist .
are you an idiot ?
what the fuck is this ?
what do you mean ?
lf you wanted ... ... to fuck her up , there are other ways to do it !
keep away from sofa ! it isn' t sofa , it' s nuria !
nuria' s dead !
calm down , or you' il be sleeping in a cell tonight !
don' t ever talk to me again !
i don' t know what the cops told you , but nuria is alive !
the cops didn' t tell me , sofa did .
listen , you spoke to her by phone , didn' t you ?
let go !
it wasn' t sofa .
nuria can imitate her voice , she took her id , her apartment .
it wasn' t over the phone .
i' ve just dropped her home .
she looked like this .
nice photo , isn' t it ?
you going to say that isn' t sofa ?
but that' s ...
is this a joke or what ?
you' re crazy , man .
i' m crazy ?
i' m crazy ?
you' re the ones who are mad !
you' re all mad !
let go of me !
god , what' s happening ?
it' s my partners , right ?
they' ve paid you , this is a plot !
look at yourself .
you haven' t been right since the accident .
fuck you !
are you saying ...
are you saying this is the girl you ran after the other night ?
is this your ideal girl ?
yes !
and you took her .
you need a psychiatrist !
problems ?
i' m in no mood , so just ...
there' s an explanation for all this .
csar .
who are you ?
you' ve seen me on tv .
what do you want ?
i' m here to help you .
first of all , it' s very important that you calm down .
calm down ?
you must overcome your fears ... ... and regal control .
what control do you mean ?
i' m fine .
who says you aren' t ?
they do .
all of them .
they say i' m mad .
no , of course you' re not mad .
but what if i told you ... ... you were dreaming ?
no , no , no ...
why not ?
look , ... ... l know what' s real , and this is real .
how do you know ?
you discover your dreams when you wake .
i just know .
my dreams are much simpler than all this .
no dream is simple .
look at those people .
they seem to be talking about their own business .
completely unaware of you .
and yet , they could be there because you ... ... wanted lt .
what' s more , ... ... you could have them at your complete service , ... ... or have them destroy you .
i want them to be quiet .
and you too .
see ?
what' s going on here ?
someone tell me the fucking truth !
the truth ?
maybe you couldn' t take lt .
it had to be a set up , a big joke to delve me crazy .
they all knew .
nuria , pelayo , the police , the guy at the bar .
who was he ?
i don' t know .
you said you saw him on tv .
on what program ?
i don' t know !
i don' t know .
one that talked about freezing the dead .
freezing the dead ?
cryonlzatlon .
like they did to walt disney .
maybe i can help you remember .
is that a threat ?
lie down .
what' s that ?
a syringe .
relax .
my arm' s stinging .
it' s a tranquilliser .
what for ?
these things are all bullshit .
lf you' d trusted psychiatrists more , ... ... you mightn' t be here now .
that flinger ...
it' s making me nervous .
you needn' t be afraid .
i' m not afraid .
stop talking and concentrate .
come on .
fuck ...
i feel dizzy .
good bye , csar .
very good .
now let' s see if you can tell me about that dream .
dream ...
in my dream , it isn' t raining .
the office dream .
ell ...
that' s lt .
i want you to tell me who ally is .
a secretary .
ell is a secretary ?
she tells me togo in .
they' re expecting me .
who' s expecting you ?
the frenchman from the tv .
sit down , please .
it' s a contract .
ell ...
csar , who is ally ?
you won' t regret lt .
sign .
what are you signing ?
ell will see to everything .
what have you signed ?
what' s wrong ?
what' s wrong , csar ?
why are you crying ?
i' m going to die .
you' re not going to die .
i don' t know how many .
how many what ?
pills .
you took pills ?
how many should i take ?
pills to feel better ?
i don' t want to .
when i count to three , you' il wake up .
one ... two ...
i thought that , up to now , you' d told me the truth .
what do you mean ?
you said you took nothing .
csar , i' il ask you for the last time .
did you take drugs ?
fuck !
why does everyone ...
stop play acting .
tell me the truth !
i must know what you took .
i didn' t take anything !
don' t you see ?
your bran could have been affected by the pills .
i didn' t take any !
you said you did !
it' s just a dream !
why make it more important than it is ?
can' t you tell dreams from reality ?
i can !
really ?
don' t make me laugh !
bodies that come to life , people who disappear , ... ... you , the phantom of the opera !
tell me one thing . o you remember what you did to sofa ?
it wasn' t sofa .
i don' t care who it was .
what did you do to her ?
you remember ?
my god !
what are you doing ?
i thought you were a burglar .
who are you ?
i' m sofa .
sofa ...
you' re not sofa .
csar , this will all be over soon .
we' il be together again .
you' il forget nuria and i won' t be afraid of you .
i' m thirsty .
i' il get some water .
sofa !
yes , csar , i' m sofa .
i' m sofa .
i want to see you .
i want to see you .
i want to see you !
i want to see you !
at times you dream you' re with someone .
for example , your father .
in seconds , he becomes your mother , ... ... and then , the newsvendor on the corner .
yet you still feel as if you' re talking to the same person .
you thought you were at home , but suddenly , ... ... you realize you' re in a school , ... ... or a hospital , ... ... or a prison .
dreams are like that .
and at times the mind behaves as if it were in a dream .
you know what derangement is ?
for fuck' s sake !
say i' m stupid if you want , but this isn' t derangement !
then what is it ?
you tell me , because i don' t know .
i don' t know what' s in here , ... ... or why you killed your girlfriend .
i don' t know who ally is , or that man from the tv .
i don' t know anything .
that makes two of us .
will you still come after the trial ?
don' t you hate the sight of me ?
what will you plead ?
why do you ask that ?
the first hearing is next week .
temporary derangement .
it' s your best chance .
even so , it won' t be much use .
they won' t believe me .
even i don' t believe lt .
what do you believe ?
i think you' re very sick , ... ... and should stay here for a long time .
don' t worry .
i' il get at least twenty years .
csar , you may not believe it , but i care about you .
i care a lot about you .
look , kid .
your case interests me .
i' m sorry about what' s happened .
i even thought someone was playing tricks on you , but ... ... l can' t and mustn' t exceed my duties .
i' m just a psychiatrist .
you don' t look like one .
what do i look like ?
my father .
preaching at me all day .
your father' s dead .
there you go .
by the way ...
what happened to that man with the wife and two daughters ?
i don' t know , i never saw him again .
take my advice , get a lawyer .
good bye , csar .
good bye . ... the main spanish investment , but certainly the most novel .
... its economic presence in cuba . ... depending on the era .
in the roman empire , for example , ... ... the normal thing was to live ... ... only25years .
who' s got the remote ?
give it to me !
get it off him !
what' s up ?
there' s a computer here connected to internet .
they' il only let me use it lf you come with me .
why do you want internet ?
i know what ally is .
walt !
ell isn' t a person , it' s a company .
how do you know ?
it isn' t ally .
it' s l. e. they' re the initials of an american company .
what are you doing ?
checking the " initials program " .
it' il tell us all it knows about l. e.
shit !
it' il take ages .
no , wait .
fuck !
i feel like i' ve done this before .
a cerebral dysfunction .
a lapse in the brain .
no , not this time .
my god !
that' s lt .
the photo in your dream ?
i had to see it before i could dream about it , right ?
cryonics " .
cryonlzatlon .
i' il print this .
wait a minute .
i don' t see what this has to do with your case .
the key is in here .
look , there' s an office in madrid .
i' il go and check it out .
no !
i have to go too .
i can' t get you out of here .
i' d be let out under supervision .
make up some excuse .
it isn' t easy .
you can do lt .
you know something else , don' t you ?
i don' t know anything .
i' ve just got a feeling .
what is it ?
i have to go there .
one way or another .
let' s get things straight .
we' re outside , i' m armed .
my job is to stop you doing anything stupid .
try anything , and you get a bullet .
i' ve been here before .
this way .
move .
you' ve got 20 minutes .
it' s just like in my dream .
good morning , can i help you ?
well , actually , we wanted to speak to mr. duvernois .
he' s my son .
he' s very shy .
mr. duvernois isn' t here right now .
but , first of all , do you know what cryonization is ?
well , more or less .
here are some leaflets .
you can read them while you' re waiting .
one of my colleagues will be with you soon .
thank you .
live without limits .
tomorrow is for the farsighted .
what is this ?
some kind of sect ?
cryonization is the biostasis ... ... or preservation of human beings .
it is the bridge to carry our patients to a future ... ... when technology will restore them to life .
you pay to live eternally .
they laughed at jules verne .
csar ...
all this is absolutely impossible .
what do you know of the future ?
they promise what the church has always promised .
immortality .
except they' re quacks , not priests .
how are you involved ?
you' re not cryonized .
you' re alive .
this is the contract , lf you want to look at lt .
the procedure is very simple .
you could die at any time .
today , tomorrow , in 20 years , it doesn' t matter to us .
at the very moment you' re declared legally dead , ... ... life extension transfers your body to our store in arizona .
there , it' s frozen at minus 78 degrees .
we call that " total suspension " , and it costs 240, 000 dollars .
30, 000 pays for the freezing process , and the rest ... ... goes into an investment fund , .. ... the interests from which pay for maintenance , ... ... and resurrection costs , the day that it' s possible .
lf it is possible .
we believe that the reanimation of the dead will be possible .
what' s this ?
what ?
clause 14 .
artificial perception .
it' s a concept ... ... that we haven' t fully developed yet .
look .
this is a life .
birth and death .
let' s say you' ve got a terminal illness .
of course , you want to go on living , but not in the future .
that doesn' t interest you .
you want to live your life now .
very well .
you die , we freeze you , ... ... and when we can resuscitate you , ... ... we' il have you live ... ... a dream .
a dream ? it will all look real .
your family and friends , your city , ... ... the world , even this office .
but it' il be a virtual reality .
what' s more , we' il make you forget that you' ve died , ... ... and that you signed this contract .
how ?
very simple .
wiping it from your memory .
you' il live your life linearly , as if nothing had happened .
and best of all , you' il live it as you like , as you wish .
you' il decide at all times .
but ...
what if there were mistakes ?
what if the dream was transformed into a nightmare ?
well , the subconscious can always play a dirty trick .
but we' re not cowboys , this is a serious company .
and virtual reality technology is constantly making huge advances .
look .
i' il be honest .
signing clause 14 is like signing for paradise .
it' s hard to believe .
but they laughed at jules verne .
excuse me .
where are you going so fast ?
to the bathroom .
well , not so fast .
i' il go with him .
he just felt ill , don' t worry .
csar , calm down , please .
this is a dream .
it' s the only explanation .
what he said is impossible .
in the 20th century , but maybe not in the 30th !
maybe not , but we' re in 1997 .
that' s what it seems .
i paid for it to seem like that .
listen !
lf this is a dream ...
look at me !
lf this is a dream , it means that i don' t exist !
i just imagine you .
no !
csar , i' m real .
how do i know that ?
can' t you tell a dream from reality ?
is this a dream , eh ?
tell me , is this a dream ?
csar , i' m wearing myself out over this case .
there is no case , i didn' t kill anyone , it' s all a nightmare !
fuck it , csar , trust me !
this isn' t a dream .
they got it wrong .
who ?
i don' t know !
but they mixed up sofa and nuria !
i see a face that isn' t mine !
i' m sick of hearing that !
your face is fine .
you' re behaving like a child , hiding behind that mask .
go on , take it off !
i don' t want to see myself !
i don' t care about that .
i want to see you .
don' t you realize ?
all that matters is what i see !
it' s my dream !
say that once more ... ... and i' il have you locked up in an asylum .
show me your face .
now .
you owe it to me .
csar ...
look in the mirror and tell me lf you think you' re disfigured .
god !
why do you keep seeing what isn' t there ?
you look fine .
i' m a monster !
what do you mean ?
anybody' d like to have your face .
you look normal .
not just normal .
you' re handsome !
csar , listen .
maybe you' ve got something like anorexia .
some girls insist they' re fat and end up crazy .
csar !
i want to wake up !
i want to wake up !
hold it !
i want to wake up !
fuck !
shit !
freeze !
don' t shoot !
this is a nightmare !
it' s a nightmare !
you !
wait a minute !
you' re not to leave !
stop !
walt a minute !
it' s a dream !
it' s a dream !
don' t move !
drop the gun !
i want to wake up .
i want to wake up .
don' t move !
i want to wake up !
antonio .
antonio !
what ?
you' re crushing me .
i' d better not move .
i' ve been shot in the back .
how do you know ?
well ...
because ...
what' s going on here ?
what the fuck' s going on ?
i told you , it' s a dream .
shut up !
shut up !
i know what this is .
it' s one of those candid camera jokes .
you did a great job , i loved it , but enough' s enough !
i see someone .
where ?
up there , on the roof .
i can' t see a thing .
where are you going ?
come on , antonio .
don' t think about it anymore .
or you' il go crazy .
hello , csar .
it' s time i introduced myself .
my name is serge duvernois .
i represent life extension .
we met ... ... 150 years ago .
what ?
has the world gone mad ?
there is no world .
it' s all in that gentleman' s mind . including you and l .
sure !
shall i thump you to see if it hurts ?
try lt .
they can make you disappear right now , like everyone else .
and who are " they " , may i ask ?
the company .
life extension .
they know everything we' re saying .
they even know what is going through cesar' s mind now , ... ... an instant after he thinks lt .
lf they can make me disappear , why haven' t they done it ?
it would be virtually incorrect .
you' ve just saved his life .
virtually incorrect ?
do you think i' m an idiot or what ?
no , quite the opposite .
you' re a great guy .
a character who is very necessary for csar .
a character ?
where are you going ?
to look for someone .
there is no one .
people aren' t necessary now .
why didn' t you wake me before ?
you only had to ask .
but that was difficult , ... ... because , in theory , ... ... you couldn' t know you were dreaming .
since when ?
remember the day of the discotheque ?
that night , when you fell asleep on the sidewalk , ... ... was the one chosen for the splice .
what splice ?
the splice ... ... between your real life and your virtual life .
a splice of 150 years which you didn' t notice ... ... because you were dead , and frozen .
from when you woke up , ... ... nothing was real .
we wiped what really happened from your memory .
what was it ?
you never saw sofa again .
and the doctors were never able to rebuild your face .
you woke up on that street with an awful hangover .
you shut yourself away for months .
one day you learned that we existed .
you came to the office , you signed the contract , ... ... and then , ... ... you killed yourself .
i paid for this ?
i paid for nuria to come back as sofa ?
i paid to look like a monster again ?
i paid to live this nightmare ?
you paid to live whatever you wanted .
we just provided the settling and the characters .
you invented your hell .
i tried to warn you in that bar .
i said it all depended on your mind .
do i just have to want it ?
can antonio come ...
there' s no one here .
they can' t have made 4 million people disappear !
you' ve overcome your fears .
lf you want , we can try again , ... ... have you live a wonderful dream , ... ... with money , friends , sofa , or whatever girl you want .
you just have to ask .
i don' t want more dreams .
it isn' t a dream !
csar , listen to me .
this is real .
this man is a sham .
let' s go down and look for people . ignore him .
it' s logical for him to behave like this , ... ... but he doesn' t feel anything .
i don' t feel anything ?
i don' t feel anything ?
what do you know about what i feel ?
ignore him , he isn' t real .
yes , i am real !
i' ve got a wife , and two daughters .
his personality is designed so that he' il say all this now .
where are my daughters ?
god !
csar ...
we can offer you another possibility .
in 1997 , it was impossible to rebuild your face .
but out there it' s the year 2145 .
you wouldn' t believe the things surgery can do .
you could wake up ... ... and live in the future like a normal person .
in the future ?
you have to choose .
how could i wake up ?
how would you wake from your worst nightmare ?
no , csar , don' t listen to him !
your partners set this up !
they want you to kill yourself !
he' s done that .
now it' il just be a formality .
i' m going to do lt .
very well .
do you have any wish before you ... ... die ?
let them out there read my mind .
who are you ?
i don' t know .
don' t keep suffering .
it' s all in your head .
it' s all psychological .
come on , csar .
what will happen to them ?
don' t prolong this farewell .
you think they' re your friends , but they' re just images .
that man isn' t really crying .
i forgot , i get vertigo .
then don' t look .
good bye , csar .
relax .
relax .
open your eyes .
