there comes a time for every vampire ... ... when the idea of eternity becomes momentarily unbearable .
living and feeding in the shadows with only your own company ... ... rots into a solitary , hollow existence .
immortality seems like a good idea ... ... until you realize you' re going to spend it alone .
so i slept , hoping the sounds of the passing eras would fade out ... ... and a sort of death might happen .
but as i lay there , the world didn' t sound like the place i had left ... ... but something different .
better ...
it became worthwhile to rise again as new gods were born and worshiped .
night and day , they were never alone .
i would become one of them .
whether it was the meal or the 100 years of rest , i' m not sure .
but suddenly i was feeling better than ever .
my senses so high ... ... they led me straight to the instrument of my resurrection ... ... playing in my old house .
jesus .
your voice ...
who the hell are you ?
the question provoked an irresistible urge .
i am the vampire lestat .
it just rolled out of my mouth .
with one sentence , i betrayed everything about my kind .
betrayed our code of secrecy .
vampire ?
that' s funny .
indeed .
hilarious .
you' re all ... ... so beautiful .
your hands are ...
cold as death ?
you' re gonna kill us ?
no .
all that you' ve ever dreamed of , i' m going to make yours .
this is your lucky day .
it was a bold move , i admit .
but from that moment on they were my friends , my children , my band .
giving the world a new god .
me .
okay , can i have your attention ?
okay , some questions .
one at a time .
yeah , you .
so why here in london ?
we go where we' re told to , like you .
how would you sum up your music ?
sex , blood and rock and roll .
okay , excuse me .
it' s time .
may i present ... ... the vampire lestat .
good evening .
sorry i' m late .
i was just trying to catch my breakfast .
okay , can we keep it short ?
one at a time .
yeah , you .
i may be wrong , but what i remember about vampires is ... ... you generally keep your identity secret .
yes .
but why hide it in this day and age ?
i' ve hidden in the shadows for centuries .
it' s time to share myself with the world .
could you prove it ?
you know , give us a demonstration of your powers .
if you like , i can give you a private demonstration in your hotel tonight .
your first and only concert' s in death valley , just days away .
why just the one ?
i don' t like repeating myself .
there are rumors about the hidden meaning in your lyrics ... ... that you' re giving away vampire secrets .
is that true ?
maybe i' m trying to resurrect a few old friends .
daring them to come out .
won' t these vampires be pissed off that you' re giving away secrets ?
i imagine they are , yes .
do you have anything to say to the other vampires ?
as a matter of fact , i do .
come out , come out , wherever you are .
see you all in death valley .
i heard lestat keeps all these girls in his cellar .
and it' s nice .
they give you food and cable and weed .
oh , please .
but you have to let him suck you on your neck whenever he wants .
doesn' t sound too bad .
done worse .
i' il say .
this way , girls .
so this is lestat' s house ?
it is this week .
we move around a lot .
why is that ?
what can i say ?
the guy is just ...
boss .
i didn' t see you there .
no .
you wouldn' t , would you ?
these are the girls that you asked for .
yes .
do you want me to take the girls home later ?
no , thank you , roger .
i' il make sure they' re taken care of .
you want some ?
want me ?
you hungry ?
you hungry for something else ?
come on .
don' t you want to have some fun ?
don' t do that .
are you ticklish ?
i' m very ticklish .
come out , come out ... ... whoever you are .
jesse .
jesse .
a voice ... ... calling to me ... ... in my dreams .
the same dream i' ve had since i was 6 .
i have a family of my own .
not a strange dream , really .
one every orphan has .
i' m sorry , but you must go .
why can' t i stay with you ?
please , aunt maharet .
i don' t want you to go .
but you must .
aunt , you' re bleeding .
you must be with your own .
i knew things were not normal .
this isn' t the life i wanted for you .
i only knew i was part of them , and being cast out ...
was i bad ?
had i done something wrong ?
i' il always be watching over you .
i want to stay with you forever .
you can' t .
i' m serena altschul , mtv news .
vampire turned rocker lestat has returned with a new cd , forsaken .
although from new orleans ... ... he claims to be an 18th century french nobleman ... ... who has been asleep for over 100 years .
here' s a look at the new video from the debut album , " redeemer .
like everyone , i assumed lestat was a joke .
a rock star with a gimmick .
then one of his lyrics caught my attention .
take a walk down the aisle at the end of the mile .
give your life to my charms in the admiral' s arms .
that rang a bell .
i tracked down old leases in london .
it turns out in the late 1600s there was a pub in mile end ... ... called the admiral' s arms .
it had a reputation for dealing with black magic ... ... and reports of people vanishing .
here' s where you could find the admiral' s arms in old london .
that part of london is mostly warehouses ... ... meat packing plants and a private club in the same location .
i think that it' s a vampire coven .
and lestat is leading us to it .
who took this picture ?
i did .
you' re still an apprentice .
you don' t do field work .
the talamasca has a code .
i know .
observe the dark realm , but be not of it .
well , it' s held good for 12 centuries .
we record and observe , but never interfere .
i had to see it for myself .
is david aware of this ?
jesse ?
hello , david .
i was explaining ...
why don' t you see me in my office ?
this is a real coven .
in the middle of london .
all the more reason to have told me first .
listen , jesse ...
... we know about lestat .
what he' s doing is unprecedented .
so why is he doing it ?
aren' t you curious ?
don' t you think we should find out ?
let me show you something .
what do you see ?
mid 1500s .
florence .
this one ?
this man is in both .
yes .
all the different paint samples ... ... all authentic .
each painted at the time of their particular style .
his name is marius .
i' ve been tracing him for years .
my little obsession .
the closest we' ve come to the original vampire .
marius himself dates back to 400 b. c.
so he' s older than lestat .
he made lestat .
how do you know that ?
because i have lestat' s journal .
i want to see it .
promise me you' il never go back to that place .
it was the winter of 1788 .
and i was brought to a mediterranean island by the man who made me .
if a man is what you' d call him .
lestat , welcome .
who are you ?
do i know you ?
i am unknowable by nature , but you may call me marius .
i' m the lord of a great manor .
they' il send an army to look for me .
i doubt they' il find you , lord de lioncourt .
you' re a long way from home .
you' re weak ... ... near passing .
i can barely hear your heartbeat .
the future hastens .
an age beyond my antique reason .
you will help me understand these times .
that' s why i chose you .
chose me for what ?
drink ... ... and live .
you' ve been brave enough for one night , my son .
drink ... ... and learn .
good , is it not ?
no more .
no more , lestat .
no more !
don' t be afraid .
it' s only your body that dies .
more .
i impressed my maker with my thirst for things .
he set out to educate me in the unknown .
taught me all about the world , its hidden history ... ... and about myself .
that' s enough , my son .
when you feed , hold back from the moment of death .
never take the last drop , or it will draw you in and you will die .
appreciate your prey .
their blood that we take into us carries with it life ... ... their life , their knowledge , their complexity .
my senses run amuck , like a newborn child .
and as for my new powers , i was beside myself with the pleasure of it all .
we' ve stayed long enough .
but we' ve spoken to no one .
a vampire' s life is a life of discretion .
discretion ?
why must we hide , marius ?
we are the powerful , we are the immortal .
we should walk fearless in the open , no ?
that cannot be .
we' re vulnerable during the day .
mortals must never know about us , for the sake of all our kind .
so i could never know her ?
not unless you wanted to kill her .
so i can never be known ?
you must be dead to the world .
come on , time to leave .
sophia , run !
run !
go !
go ...
lestat ... ... stop her !
you must !
we must remain in the shadows .
you still have a few lingering mortal emotions .
they' il serve you no good , my friend .
forgive me .
the faces of my victims haunted me , reminding me of my fate .
for nights and days i played ... ... furious that i would never partake of the simple joys of the world .
i was meant for more than this .
marius ?
would you like me to play for you ?
what have you done , lestat ?
more !
i don' t think so , my little lord .
let me go .
no .
you' ve had the purest blood , seen the oldest things .
far too much for one as young as you .
her blood is like liquid fire .
who is she ?
she' s your mother .
she' s my mother .
akasha , the queen of all who are damned .
and he' s her king .
akasha and enkil nearly drank this earth dry when they ruled over egypt .
they drank until enkil lost his will to drink .
without her mate beside her , she also lost hers .
they became living statues .
she respects nothing except the taste of blood , human and immortal alike .
no .
release me !
she made you quite powerful .
you' il not stop me !
can i hear her blood in your voice ?
in all the years of my care , not once have they moved .
until tonight .
and she chose me .
i chose you .
where are you going ?
marius !
many times since , i have called to marius .
but there was no answer .
just the endless procession of days , months ... ... years .
my teacher left me to my darkest lesson .
that in the end , we are alone .
and there is nothing but the cold , dark wasteland of eternity .
david thought the journal would satisfy my curiosity .
but it only made me want to know more .
i had to go back to the admiral' s arms .
i had no choice .
this is a fantastic place .
i love it .
you sure i can' t get you a drink ?
soon .
hi .
hi .
come here often ?
all the time .
i don' t see any marks .
you haven' t seen the rest of my body .
is that an invitation ?
sorry , i' m taken .
and ... ... where is your host ?
he' s here somewhere .
this host , what' s his name ?
marius .
sorry , don' t know the guy .
of course not .
he' s an ancient .
there aren' t any ancients left .
they all turned to dust .
so unless you' ve got him in a bottle somewhere ...
you' re brave to joke .
i wish you could meet him .
and why is that ?
because you might learn something .
excuse me .
going somewhere ?
now this will only hurt a little bit .
in fact , you might even enjoy it .
don' t do this .
boo .
that was quite a performance .
you should be more careful .
thanks .
for what ?
you saved me .
how presumptuous .
so you know marius ?
i know a lot of things .
not how to stay alive , apparently .
i guess we have that in common .
although i' m a little ahead of the race here .
well , i can fix that .
your song " redeemer " is about the girl with the violin . lsn' t it ?
yeah .
is it ?
what else do you think you know ?
i ...
you' re shaking .
cold .
still cold ?
go on .
tell me more about me .
you want ...
what do i want ?
you yearn .
what do i yearn ?
for what do i yearn ?
to walk with the living .
out of the cold , dark wasteland of eternity .
well ... ... that makes you a very clever librarian .
talamasca .
i knew i left that journal somewhere .
was it a good read ?
it touched me .
did it , now ?
don' t worry , jesse .
your kind never satisfies my thirst .
lestat , i know something that' s not in your journal .
what ?
you still have the violin , don' t you ?
no , i understand .
after all , it' s only human .
clever librarian .
david , listen , i' m going to los angeles for the concert .
i met him , david .
i talked to lestat .
what ?
jesse ?
listen to me very carefully now .
you are no longer seeing things clearly .
lestat told the world that vampires live among us .
they' re mad .
they' il be at the concert to kill him .
you' ve become obsessed with it .
i' m worried about you .
don' t worry about me .
i' il be okay .
i' il check in and ...
i' m sorry .
i have to go .
no , jesse ...
the city of lost angels already fed on the blood of youth .
my presence here barely stirred a ripple .
we had three days till the concert .
i could feel something was coming .
i just couldn' t figure out what .
marius .
lestat .
it is good to see you , lestat .
and you .
still wearing the old fashions , i see .
old habits die hard .
how did you manage to slip through the ' 50s in red velvet ?
i slept .
don' t think you missed much .
elvis .
elvis , yes .
you' re bigger than he is now .
so ...
after all this time ... ... what' s the occasion ?
you' ve just become very hard to avoid these days , at least in conversation .
what are you trying to prove , lestat ?
oh , please .
it' s a little too late to come over all paternal now , marius .
two hundred years and not a word from you .
you almost cost me everything .
now you' ve done it again .
this isn' t the time to settle old scores .
vampires don' t settle old scores .
we harbor them .
how did you find me ?
i made you .
i' ve always known where you are .
besides ... ... l just had to look for the most gauche house on the block .
come .
let me show you what it means to live in the light .
lmpressive .
reminds me of old mad druids running around chanting in the forest .
a return to the primitive .
out there , my fans ... ... they worship me .
millions of arms reach out to embrace , beg me to come into their lives .
it' s what you always wanted .
with all my black little heart .
did you think of anyone but yourself ?
i only have myself .
you taught me that .
it may be time to get ready for some company .
what' s that supposed to mean ?
your music' s woken an old friend .
can' t you hear it ?
or is the applause all you can hear now ?
akasha .
arisen .
she has taken the king' s blood .
absorbed his power .
good .
let her come .
cancel the concert .
never .
you' re no match for her , lestat .
you' re not a god .
we were once mortals too .
it is our heritage we protect .
such reverence for mortals .
then you should have left me as one .
scent is fading .
he was here too long ago .
you like him , do you ?
he reminds me of someone .
all he' s going to remind you of soon is a pile of bones .
we' re going to dismember him .
bleed him dry .
really ?
is that what you' re going to do ?
old gods on new streets .
not only had the concert sold out among the living ... ... it seemed all the undead were coming too .
there would be angry vampires out there ... ... frightened of the light i was directing on all our kind .
do you have anything to say to the other vampires ?
yes , as a matter of fact , i do .
come out , come out , wherever you are .
they wanted me dead .
let them try .
bring it on .
better dead than alone .
hey , honey .
want tickets for tomorrow ?
going to the show ?
no .
come on , i got them for $ 200 . $ 200 ?
i don' t think so .
what if i say 150 ?
150 ?
you' re gonna cut me a deal ?
so , listen , just two girls , okay ?
so how old are you again ?
check it out .
champagne ?
yeah .
oh , my god , i can' t believe it' s really you !
i' m your biggest fan .
boo .
boo back .
lestat , i came all the way from tarzana .
really ?
and you ?
london .
a london goth .
i see .
it' s funny , i would have pegged you for a talamascan .
maybe in another life .
i' m an episcopalian .
and i' m a frigging buddhist .
lestat ...
roger , would you take our little episcopalian back to church ?
just the one tonight ?
sure .
sweetheart , come on .
what ?
come on .
what ?
it' s a good thing .
can i still go backstage ?
why are you following me ?
what do you want ?
so you come all this way just to return this to me ?
out of the goodness of your heart ?
i want you to show me what it' s like .
what what is like , exactly ?
t o be like you .
i don' t have time for this .
all a vampire has is time .
not this one .
right .
the covens are coming for you .
how are you going to spend your last night , as you always have , alone ?
why not ?
why not share it with me ?
all right .
this may be painful for a mortal .
you' re still attached to your skin .
i don' t care .
do you trust me ?
yes .
then close your eyes .
marius was right .
but i never understood until i met you .
what do you mean ?
you' re beautiful to me because you' re human .
your frailty ... ... your short years ... ... your heart ... ... even as you think it' s breaking .
all that ... ... seems suddenly more precious than anything i have ever known .
i' m not as precious as you think .
do it .
please .
let me be with you .
let me know everything .
you want to know everything ?
come , then .
i' il show you .
what is it ?
what are we doing ?
is she all right ?
get away !
get off me !
now you see ?
are you ready ?
now do you want it , huh ?
no .
of course you don' t .
they' re pretty worked up .
how you feeling ?
hey , girls , come on !
okay , through here .
let him through !
back off , fella !
come on , children .
okay , guys .
come on !
let him through .
jesse !
jesse !
hello , david .
i must show you my new paintings sometime .
find jesse .
you want more ?
this one' s for those who' ve come for me .
akasha .
akasha ?
why so surprised , my love ?
you called , i have come .
my love ?
never fear me , lestat .
all your wishes have come true .
my wishes ?
for a companion to share eternity .
you' re bold , like your music .
you live your life in the open , like i did long ago ... ... when i had a king .
had a king ?
he' s no more .
now you are my consort .
that' s why i kept you safe .
alive .
you ?
you thought it was all you ?
the ego of a king as well .
yes .
i know you , lestat .
i know that you crave to have the world at your feet .
and i have come to give it to you .
where are we ?
we are home .
we live everywhere and anywhere we choose .
the world is our garden .
all these years i' d hoped this place was real .
for the first time in my life , i feel like i' m home .
strange that this journey should lead me here .
this place that' s haunted my dreams .
aunt , you' re bleeding .
you must be with your own .
i' il always be watching over you .
i want to stay with you forever .
forever is a very long time .
aunt maharet .
you haven' t aged , you haven' t changed at all .
i was once a mortal too .
i bore a child before akasha took me .
i took care of that child ... ... and her children , and her children' s children .
this is our family .
my way of coping with eternity .
you are what keeps me connected to the world of the living .
when your parents died , i brought you here to take care of you .
now is not the time .
you were seeking answers and now you' ve found them .
the family is who you are .
drinking my blood allows you to live in the light .
and soon the sun will no longer sting your eyes .
this is but a taste of what we shall share , my love .
my king ... ... behold our kingdom .
a kingdom of corpses ?
why ?
why not ?
this is why you have risen ?
they believed in nothing .
now they are nothing .
but you and i , we will change all that .
we will give the world something to believe in again .
now come , my love .
we have a score to settle .
since my mortal death , i have watched ... ... l have guided and cared for my human family ... ... generations beyond memory .
this is why we must fight akasha .
for the sake of your great family .
the world we know is about to end .
the only way to prevent this is through akasha' s destruction .
but how ?
when she gives blood , she' s vulnerable .
whoever takes the last of her blood will not survive it .
what about lestat ?
lestat has joined with akasha .
he' s lost to us now .
forget him .
my children .
it warms my blood to see you all gathered ... ... plotting against me .
akasha .
maharet .
you will address my king first .
lestat , what has she done to you ?
lestat , step aside .
never .
the world has changed since you reigned .
then we shall change it back .
humans are animals ... ... brute creatures .
their destruction can only make sense .
we' ve found other ways to coexist .
in silence !
in shadows and shame !
and for what ?
for respect of mortals ?
they are nothing to us .
they are merely food .
akasha , please ...
you think you can change my will ?
i' ve had enough of this discussion .
join me or die .
i will not .
i will not .
i will not .
i will not .
do you love me ?
yes .
then prove it .
kill her .
she' s nothing to me .
just the same ... ... i' d like for you to kill her .
you will not touch her !
you still think to challenge me ?
now .
no , it' s all right , aunt maharet .
it' s what i want .
how sweet .
i' m ready .
see , my children ?
remember your real family !
or join hers .
now ... ... give me my crown .
spoken like a true king .
come .
you see how he obeys ?
you will ... ... or you will all die .
that is enough , lestat .
that is enough , lestat !
stop !
you kill me ... ... you kill yourselves .
wait , lestat .
you must stop .
she drank akasha' s last drop .
she took akasha' s death into herself .
she' s not dead .
she sleeps .
hello ?
oh , my god !
jesse ?
hello , david .
david , this is lestat .
hello .
i have something for you .
i believe ... ... that you wanted this back .
yes , thank you .
thank you so much .
can i ask ...
what' s it like ?
do you want to find out ?
me ?
no , i' m too old to live forever .
well , if you ever change your mind ...
so this is goodbye .
yes .
hello , david .
