he' s just trying to piss us off .
maverick , get down here and get this asshole off me !
easy , cougar .
bring him back , hard right .
help me engage .
i' m on my way .
i can' t shoot this son of a bitch .
let' s see if we can have a little fun with him .
is this your idea of fun , mav ?
greetings .
watch the birdie .
geez , i crack myself up .
this is a great shot , mav .
i should be a photographer .
cougar , your tail is clear .
mig one has bugged out .
cougar , this is maverick .
we' ve had enough fun for one day , don' t you think ?
i' m getting a lil ' low on fuel , so we' re heading home .
we' il see you on deck .
cougar , we' re running low on gas , we gotta get outta here .
cougar ?
we' re on vapour , cougar .
let' s do it .
cougar , come on , cougar !
let' s take it back to the ship , man .
come on , cougar .
get him on deck as soon as possible , he' s gotta be low on fuel .
cougar , we' ve got to land this thing .

maverick , you' re 3/ 4 to fall out , call the ball .
roger .

cougar !
goddamn it , maverick !
what' re you doing , mav ?
we' ve got no fuel for this .
we' re going after cougar .
you tell him to land that plane .
that' s an order !
ghostrider , you' re instructed to land .
land immediately .
any of you boys seen an aircraft carrier around here ?
man , we got a lil ' problem up here , that mig really screwed him up .
i don' t think he can make it back .
you' re okay , cougar .

i' il take you all the way in .

3/ 4 over now , call the ball .
rogerball .
you' re too low .
you' re too low , cougar !
more power !
come in .
cougar , you should be in a sickbed , what' s on your mind ?
my wife and kid , sir .
i almost orphaned him today . , and i' ve never even seen him .
i don' t know what happened up there , but i was so scared .
come on , we' ve seen this before .
no , sir .
i' m holding on too tight .
i' ve lost the edge .
i' m sorry , sir .
i' m sorry .
cougar ?
thanks , maverick .
maverick , goose , come in here .
what the hell' s going on ?
i don' t know .
shit .
maverick , you just did an incredibly brave thing .
what you should have done was land your plane .
you don' t own that plane , the taxpayers do !
son , your ego' s writing cheques your body can' t cash .
you' ve been busted , you' ve lost your qualifications as section leader three times .
put in hack twice by me with a history of high speed passes ... ... over five air control towers and one admiral' s daughter !
penny benjamin ?
you , asshole , you' re lucky to be here .
thank you , sir .
and let' s not bullshit , maverick .
your family name ain' t the best in the navy .
you need to be doing it better and cleaner than the other guy , now what is it with you ?
just want to serve my country , be the best fighter pilot in the navy , sir .
don' t screw around with me , maverick .
you' re a hell of an instinctive pilot .
maybe too good .
i' d like to bust your butt , but i can' t ... ... i got another problem here .
i gotta send somebody from this squadron to miramar .
i gotta do something .
i still can' t believe it .
i gotta give you your dream shot .
i' m gonna send you up against the best .
you two characters are going to top gun .
for five weeks you' re going to fly against the best pilots in the world .
you were number two .
cougar was number one .
cougar lost it , turned in his wings .
you guys are number one .
you screw up just this much , you' il be flying a cargo plane full of rubber dog shit out of hong kong .
yes , sir !
that is all .
tell me about the mig some other time .
gentlemen ?
good luck , gentlemen .
thank you , sir .
thank you .
during korea , the navy kill ratio was 12 to 1 .
we shot down 12 of their jets for every one of ours .
during vietnam , that ratio fell to 3 to 1 .
our pilots become dependant upon missiles .
they lost some of their dog fighting skills .
now , top gun was created to teach acm " air combat manoeuvring " .
dog fighting .
this gives me a hard on .
by the end of vietnam , that ratio was back to 12 to 1 .
don' t tease me .
blinds , please .
i' d like to take this opportunity to introduce you to our commanding officer at top gun . ... very first man to win the top gun trophy .
you will not find a finer fighter pilot anywhere in the world .
commander mike metcalf .
call sign , viper .
gentlemen ...
you' re the top one percent of all naval aviators .
the elite .
the best of the best .
we' il make you better .
you fly at least two combat missions a day , attend classes inbetween , and evaluations of your performance .
on each combat sequence you' re gonna meet a different challenge .
every encounter is gonna be much more difficult .
we' re gonna teach you to fly the f 14 right to the edge of the envelope , faster than you' ve ever flown before .
and more dangerous .
now , we don' t make policy here , gentlemen .
elected officials , civilians , do that .
we are the instruments of that policy , and although we are not at war , we must always act as though we are at war .
what are you doing ?
just wondering who' s the best .
in case some of you wonder who the best is , they' re here on this plaque on the wall .
the best driver and his rlo from each class has his name on it .
and they have the option to come back here to be top gun instructors .
you think your name' s gonna be on that plaque ?
yes , sir .
that' s pretty arrogant , considering the company you' re in .
yes , sir .
i like that in a pilot .
remember , when it' s over out there , we' re all on the same team .
gentlemen , this school is about combat .
there are no points for second place .
dismissed .
nice going .
the plaque for the alternates is down in the ladies ' room .
oh , jesus ...
you kill me .
you really do .
no , no , no .
there' s two o' s in goose , boys .
this is what i call a target rich environment .
you live your life between your legs , mav .
goose , even you could get laid in a place like this .
i' d be happy to find a girl who' d talk dirty to me .
mav , you wanted to know who the best is ?
that' s him .
iceman .
that' s the way he flies .
ice cold .
no mistakes .
just wears you down .
you get bored , frustrated , you do something stupid , and he' s got you .
hey , hey , slider .
i thought you wanted to be a pilot , man .
what happened ?
goose , you' re suck a dickhead .
whose butt did you kiss to get here ?
the list is long but distinguished .
yeah , so is my johnson .
so you' re flying with lceman , huh .
it' s mr. iceman for you .
hey , mother goose , how' s it going ?
doing good .
tom , this is pete mitchell .
tom kazansky .
congratulations on top gun .
thank you .
sorry to hear about cougar ... ... you know , we were like brothers in fight school .
he was a good man .
still is a good man .
yeah , that' s what i meant .
thought so .
so , you need any help ?
with what ?
you figured it out yet ?
what' s that ?
who' s the best pilot .
no , i think i can figure that one out on my own .
i heard that about you .
you like to work alone .
mav , you must' ve your soul under a lucky star , huh .
i mean , first the mig and then you slide into cougar' s spot ...
we didn' t slide into cougar' s spot , it was ours , ok .
yeah well , some pilots wait a whole career to see a mig up close .
guess you guys are lucky and famous , huh .
no , you mean notorious .
i' il see you later .
you can count on it .
they were abused children .
we' re gonna have a good time .
always .
okay , i guess it' s my turn , isn' t it ?
all right , the bet is 20 dollars .
you have to have carnal knowledge , of a lady this time , on the premises .
on the premises .
come on , mav ... a bet' s a bet .
i don' t know , it just doesn' t seem fair ... for you , i mean .
but uh ...
she' s lost that loving feeling .
she' s los ...
no , she hasn' t .
yes , she has .
she has not lost that lo ...
goose , she' s lost it , man .
come on .
i hate it when she does that .
excuse me , miss .
hey , hey , hey .
don' t worry .
i' il take care of this .
you never close your eyes anymore when i kiss your lips ... ... there' s no tenderness like before in your fingertips ...
you' re trying hard not to show it , baby ... ... but baby , believe me , i know that ...
you lost that loving feeling , oh , that loving feeling .
you lost that loving feeling , now it' s gone , gone , gone ...
sit down .
thank you .
i love that song .
i' ve never seen that approach .
how long have you two been doing this act ?
i don' t know .
since uh ...
puberty ?
right , puberty .
i' m charlotte blackwood .
i' m maverick .
" maverick " ?
did your mother not like you or something ?
no , it' s my call sign .
you' re a pilot !
that' s right .
a naval aviator .
actually , we' ve only done this twice .
oh , how' d you do ?
crashed and burned on the first one , it wasn' t pretty .
and the second ?
i don' t know , i' il tell you tomorrow .
but it' s looking good so far .
well , " maverick " ... my friend just arrived , so it' s been great talking to you .
perry !
hi .
hi .
here you go .
i' il be with you in just a second , ok .
listen , can i ask you a personal question ?
that depends .
are you a good pilot ?
i can hold my own .
great .
then i won' t have to worry about you making your living as a singer .
i' m gonna need a beer to put these flames out .
great , mav .
real slick .
a long cruise , was it , sailor ?
too long .
what you wanna do , just drop by down on the tile and go for it ?
i actually had this counter in mind .
that would be very , very comfortable , yeah .
it could be .
actually , i came in here to save you from making a big mistake with that older guy .
really ?
so i could go on to a bigger one with a young guy like yourself ?
maybe .
i have to get up early in the morning .
what are you doing ?
your friend was magnificent .
you' il also be trained and evaluated by civilian specialists .
the civilians are hre because they are our very best source of information on enemy aircraft .
one of the most qualified is our call sign charlie .
she has a ph. d. in astrophysics .
and she' s also a civilian contract , so you do not salute her .
but you better listen to her , because the pentagon listens to her about your proficiency .
all yours , charlie .
hello .
we will be dealing with f 5s and a 4s as our mig simulators .
now , then , as most of you know , the f 5 doesn' t have the thrust to weight ratio of the mig 28 .
and it doesn' t bleed energy below 300 knots like the mig 28 .
however , the mig 28 does have a problem with its inverted flight tanks .
it won' t do a negative g push over .
the latest intelligence tells us the most it will do is 1 negative ...
excuse me , lieutenant .
is there something wrong ?
yes , ma' am .
the data on the mig is inaccurate .
how' s that , lieutenant ?
well , i just happened to see a mig 28 ...
we , we .
sorry , goose .
we happened to see a mig 28 do a 4 g negative dive .
where did you see this ?
that' s classified .
it' s what ?
it' s classified .
i could tell you , but then i' d have to kill you .
lieutenant , i have top secret clearance .
the pentagon sees to it that i know more than you .
well , ma' am , it doesn' t seem so in this case now , does it ? .
so , lieutenant ... where exactly were you ?
well , we started up on his six when he pulled through the clouds .
i went above him .
if you were directly above him , how could you see him ?
because i was inverted .
bullshit .
no , he was , man .
it was a really great move .
he was inverted .
you were in a 4 g inverted dive with a mig 28 ?
yes , ma' am .
at what range ?
about two metres ?
well , it was actually about 1/ 2 , i think .
i have a great polaroid of it .
it was a nice picture .
lieutenant ?
what were you doing there ?
communicating .
communicating .
keeping up foreign relations .
i was , you know , giving him the bird .
you know , the finger .
i know the finger , goose .
i' m sorry , i hate it when it does that .
i' m sorry .
excuse me .
so you' re the one ?
yes , ma' am .
all right , we have a hop to take .
the hard deck on this hop will be 10, 000 feet .
there' il be no engagement below that .
move it !
lieutenant !
okay , don' t be late again .
you look great , honey .
lieutenant , why didn' t you tell me you were the famous mig lnsulter ?
would it have made any difference ?
not in the ladies ' room , no .
and what would' ve ?
i' m an instructor at this school , i see 20 new hotshots every eight weeks .
now , i' m sure you can figure that out .
look , lieutenant .
i' d just really like to hear about the mig sometime .
you' ve got security clearance .
you read about it .
maverick ...
i' m curious .
who was covering cougar while you were showboating with this mig ?
cougar was doing just fine .
gentlemen , this is your first hop .
the jets you' re flying against are smaller and faster and more manoeuvreable .
just like the enemy migs .
clock is ticking , and as of now we are keeping score .
i lost him , goose .
show me what you' ve got , kid .
i lost him .
i' m looking .
i' m looking .
i got him , i got him .
he' s on our tail , coming hard .
i got him .
here we go .
alright , talk to me , goose .
he' s still back there .
he' s closing in on us .
he' s closing fast .
you can run , kid , but you can' t hide .
all right , jester , i' il give you a run for your money here .
watch the mountains !
i still got ' im , he' s still back there .
come on , mav , do some of that pilot shit .
yeah .
i got ' im .
come on , bring it right .
i' ve had about enough of this shit .
when i hit the brakes , he' il fly right by .
you' re mine .
jesus christ !
let' s see what you' ve got now , jester .
ok , man .
let' s turn and burn .
he' s going vertical .
so am l .
we' re going ballistic , man .
go get him !
he' s going for the hard deck .
let' s get down there first and nail him , mav .
no way , jester .
you' re mine .
i' ve got you now !
jester' s dead .
jester' s dead .
get your butts above the hard deck and return to base .
yes , sir !
tower , this is ghost rider requesting a fly by .
negative , ghost rider .
the pattern is full .
no , no , mav .
this is not a good idea .
sorry , goose ... but it' s time to buzz the tower .
goddamn son of a bitch !
great balls of fire .
jester' s dead .
you won ?
bullshit .
didn' t everybody ? .
no , man .
we got our butts kicked .
30 seconds .
we went like this , he went like that ... ... i said to hollywood , " where did he go ?
hollywood said , " where did who go ?
and he' s laughing at us right on the radio , he' s laughing at us .
that was me laughing , dickhead .
we won .
all right !
they won too , man .
that' s not what i heard .
no , we did .
we got jester .
below the hard deck doesn' t count .
hard deck my ass , we nailed that son of a bitch .
you guys really are cowboys .
what' s your problem , kazansky ?
you' re everyone' s problem .
that' s because every time you go up in the air , you' re unsafe .
i don' t like you because you' re dangerous .
that' s right , lceman .
i am dangerous .
maverick .
you and goose get your butts outta that flight gear and up to viper' s office , now !
remember boys , no points for second place .
you' re a lot brighter than you look .
you shut up .
don' t worry , don' t worry .
two of your snot nosed jockeys did a fly by at my tower at over 400 knots .
i want somebody' s butt , i want it now , i' ve had it .
goddamn it , that' s twice .
i want some butts !
well , that' il just about cover the fly bys .
follow me .
gentlemen .
you had a hell of a first day .
the hard deck for this hop was 10, 000 feet .
you knew it .
you broke it .
you followed commander heatherly below after he lost sight of you .
why ?
sir , i had commander heatherly in my sights .
he saw me move in for the kill ... ... he then proceeded below the hard deck .
we weren' t below 10, 000 for more than a few seconds .
i had the shot .
there was no danger , so i took it .
you took it , and broke a major rule of engagement .
then you broke another one with that circus stunt fly by .
lieutenant mitchell , top gun rules of engagement exist for your safety and for that of your team .
they' re not flexible , nor am l .
either obey them or you are history .
is that clear ?
yes , sir !
dismissed .
i really enjoyed that , mav , thanks a lot .
holy shit .
maybe i could learn how to be a truck driver .
mav , you got the number of that truck driving school that was on tv , truck master , something like this ?
i might need that .
state in those reports says it all .
he' s a wild card .
completely unpredictable .
he got you , didn' t he ?
yeah .
maverick .
i flew with his old man .
tell me one thing ... if you had to go into battle , would you want him with you ?
i don' t know .
i just don' t know .
still awake ?
yeah .
what' s up ?
can' t sleep .
you kow , when i realised we were going to top gun , all i could think about was getting that trophy .
i' ve got to be straight with you , mav .
right now , i just hope we graduate .
i got a family to think about .
i can' t afford to blow this .
i guess that fly by wasn' t such a big hit , huh ?
look , man , i know it' s tough for you .
the academy rejected you because you' re duke mitchell' s kid .
you have to live with that reputation .
but it' s like everytime we go up there , it' s like you' re flying against a ghost .
it makes me nervous .
you' re the only family i' ve got .
i' m not gonna let you down .
i promise .
get out of here .
a rolling reversal would work well in that situation .
if i reversed on a hard cross , i could immediately go to guns on him .
but at that speed , it' s too fast .
it' s a little bit too aggressive .
too aggressive ?
yeah , i guess when i see something , i go right after it .
you didn' t tell me who you were the other night .
you didn' t give me a chance , did you ?
you deserved it .
i know ... but uh ... you were tempted ... to ask me out for dinner .
no .
no ?
no .
i don' t date students .
i can see it' s dangerous for you .
but if the government trusts me ... ... maybe you could .
it takes a lot more than just fancy flying .
crash and burn , huh , mav ? .
slider ...
you stink .
let' s go !
come on , mav .
just one more game .
that evens it up .
i got some things to take care of .
" take care of " ?
just one more game .
please ?
for me ?
i' m sorry .
you' re sorry ...
come on ...
for me ?
damn it .
lieutenant ?
what ?
no singing ?
look , i' m ...
no apologies .
if you don' t mind , i' m ...
i' m just gonna take a quick shower while you' re finishing up here .
yeah , i do mind .
i' m hungry .
and then i thought about it .
i thought , " you know , he' s a smart guy .
why don' t you just tell him why you' ve got him here ?
it' s the mig .
the mig .
you' re the only pilot who' s been up against a mig 28 .
i' m trying for this big promotion .
if i get it , i won' t be here much longer .
seems to me you' ve got it all figured out .
except you did forget the wine .
sorry .
you always get what you want ?
no , not always .
yeah , maybe .
then relax about the mig .
this music ...
an old friend ?
my folks loved it .
i haven' t heard this in years .
my mother used to call from her room and have me play this over and over again ... ... i got so sick of it .
but not her .
she' d sit up there alone , just listening for hours .
just listening .
she died shortly after him .
what happened to your father ?
i guess i kinda figured with your security clearance you' d know more about it than i do .
well , i didn' t get that far .
well , that' s a big mystery .
he disappeared in an f 4 , november 5th , 1965 .
the stink of it was ... he screwed up .
no way .
my old man was a great fighter pilot .
but who the hell knows ?
it' s all classified .
somebody must know .
yeah , somebody knows everything .
is that why you' re always second best up there ?
you are direct , aren' t you .
i' m sorry i was late .
i' m sorry for being direct .
no apologies .
this is going to be complicated .
where are you going ?
i' m gonna take a shower .
thank you .
i enjoyed being here .
it looks like you need another shower .
right .
i' m gonna be honest with you .
your mig sighting is really important to my work , but uh ...
i don' t normally invite students to my house .
you' re uh ...
but please understand , i still have a job to do .
i' m glad we got that straight .
i told her how tough it is here .
you know , my ass dragging like an old tired dog .
i told her you didn' t even have a woman here .
she said , " oh , he probably doesn' t have 1 , he' s got 8 .
hi !
daddy .
so , maverick !
goose tells me you' re in love with one of your instructors .
is that right ?
i didn' t tell her that .
i can' t believe you said that .
that was a secret .
the bogey has good position right here .
freeze frame .
a moment of choice .
the f 14 is defensive .
he has a chance to bug out right here .
better to retire and save your aircraft than push a bad position .
charlie , jump in here any time .
now , you stay in that diamond another three seconds ... ... the bogey' s gonna blow you out in the sky .
you take a hard right , select zone five ... ... you can extend an escape .
you made a bad choice .
charlie ?
aircraft one performs a split s ?
that' s the last thing you should do .
the mig' s right on your tail .
freeze there , please .
the mig has you in his gunsight .
what were you thinking at this point ?
you don' t have time to think up there .
if you think , you' re dead .
that' s a big gamble with a $30 million dollar plane , lieutenant .
unfortunately , the gamble worked .
the mig never got a clean shot .
maverick makes an aggressive vertical move here , comes over the top , and he defeats the bandit with a missile shot .
the encounter was a victory , but i think we have show it as an example of what not to do .
next .
gutsiest move i ever saw , man .
now then , this is a perfect example of a textbook manoeuvre .
lieutenant ?
my review of your performance was right on , in my professional opinion .
i can' t hear you .
jesus christ !
and you think i ' m reckless !
when i fly , my crew and my plane come first .
well , i' m gonna finish my sentence , lieutenant .
my review of your flight performance was right on .
is that right ?
that is right .
but i held something back .
i see some real genius in your flying , maverick , but i can' t say that in there .
i was afraid that everyone in that tacts training would see right through me .
i just don' t want anyone to know that i' ve fallen for you .
hey , maverick ?
you hear about lce ?
what' s that ?
he won another one .
really ?
yeah .
i fell the need ... ... the need for speed .
gentlemen , this is hop 19 .
multiple aircraft , multiple bogeys .
your training is half over .
the competltion for the top gun trophy remains tight .
first place , lceman .
second place , maverick .
just two points behind .
there they are .
three miles , left , 10 o' clock .
i don' t think they see us yet .
ok , i see them .
two a 4s .
left 10 o' clock level .

30 seconds , wolfman .
i' m coming in .
shut up !
that was some of the best flying i' ve seen yet .
right up to the part where you got killed .
you never , never leave your wingman .
maverick ...
it' s not your flying , it' s your attitude .
the enemy' s dangerous , but right now you' re worse than the enemy .
you' re dangerous and foolish .
you may not like who' s flying with you , they may not like you ... but whose side are you on ?
at least viper got lceman before he got us .
we' ve still got a shot at it .
that was stupid , i know better than that .
that will never happen again .
i know ...
i know .
maverick , would you go fetch him .
doesn' t he ever embarrass you ?
goose ? , hell no .
well , there was the time ...
admiral' s daughter .
what ? !
he told me all about the time you went ballistic with penny benjamin .
did he ?
that' s great ...
he tells me about all of them .
how my lil ' angel goose goes home early for church ...
... and you !
you always go home with the hot women .
alright .
thank you , carole .
i' m gonna go embarrass myself with goose for a while .
i' d love to be able to warn you off about maverick , but i just love him to death .
i' ve known pete for a lot of years now and ...
i' m telling you , one thing' s for certain .
there are hearts breaking wide open all over the world tonight .
why ?
because , unless you are a fool , that boy is off the market .
he is 100 % prime time in love with you .
hey , goose , you big stud .
that' s me , honey .
take me to bed or lose me forever .
show me the way home , honey .
come on , brother , sing with the family .
maverick , you big stud ...
take me to bed or lose me forever .
okay , gentlemen , this is hop 31 .
two weeks to graduation .
the top gun trophy is still up for grabs , so every point counts .
well , it' s bottom of the night , the score is tied .
it' s time for the big one .
you up for this one , maverick ?
just a walk in the park , cazansky .
contact .
multiple bogeys , 165 .
two miles .
looks like they' re going away from us .
oh , i see ' em .
right , two o' clock .
i' m in .
i' m in .
that son of a bitch cut me off .
come on .
jesus christ , lce , take the shot .
come on , ice .
get the hell out of there .
i can' t get the angle .
i' m too close for missiles .
i' m switching to guns .
ice , fire or clear !
look at this !
jesus christ , i can take a shot right here .
i need another 20 seconds and i' ve got him .
i' m moving in .
i' ve got the shot .
come on , mav , let' s get in there .
come on , mav !
maverick' s getting impatient .
now , come on , take the shot .
10 more seconds , then i' ve got ' im .
come on , get the hell out of there .
let' s do it , mav .
ice , come off my right .
i' m in .
five more seconds .
come off my right .
i' m in .
i' m off .
shit .
we' re in a jetwash .
shit !
this is not good .
shit , we' ve got a flame out , mav .
engine one is out ...
engine two is out .
i' m losing control .
i can' t control it !
it' s coupling up .
this is not good !
mayday , mayday .
mav' s in trouble .
he' s in a flat spin heading out to sea !
altitude 8, 000 ... 7, 000 ...
we' re at 6, 000 !
i can' t reach the ejection handle !
you' re gonna have to punch us out .
i can' t reach the ejection handle !
eject ...
watch the canopy !
goose ...
oh , no !
oh , god .
sir , let go of him .
you' ve got to let him go , sir .
how are you doing ?
i' m all right .
goose is dead .
i know .
you fly jets long enough , something like this happens .
he was my rlo , my responsibility .
in my squadron in vietnam , we lost 8 of 18 aircraft .
10 men .
the first one dies , you die too .
but there will be others .
you can count on it .
you' ve got to let him go .
you' ve got to let him go .
i think maybe it was my fault .
i don' t know .
i don' t know what the hell went wrong .
i' d like to help .
i know it' s difficult .
god , i want him back .
i' il be here if you need me , okay ?
god , he loved flying with you , maverick .
he would have flown anyway ... without you .
he' d' ve hated it , but he would have done it .
we find that the f 14 flatspin was induced by the disruption of air flow into the starboard engine .
this disruption stalled the engine ... ... which produced enough yaw rate to induce a spin ... ... which was unrecoverable .
there was no way lieutenant mitchell could see or avoid the jetwash which produced the engine stall .
therefore , the board of lnquiry finds lieutenant mitchell was not at fault in the accident of 29th of july .
lieutenant mitchell' s record will be cleared of this incident .
lieutenant mitchell' s restored to flight status without further delay .
these proceedings are closed .
get him up flying , soon .
come on , kid , come on .
get in there .
engage .
alright , you' ve got a bogey at two o' clock low , maverick .
you got the angle , piece of cake now .
take the shot , kid .
take the shot .
you can engage any time , maverick .
hey !
where the hell are you going ?
it' s not good .
it doesn' t look good .
what do you mean , " it doesn' t look good " ?
it doesn' t get to look any better than that .
hey , man .
we coulda had him ...
hey !
we coulda had him , man !
i' il fire when i' m goddamn good and ready .
you got that ?
he can' t get back in the saddle , he won' t engage .
it' s only been a few days .
you know , he just might not make it back .
keep sending him up .
mitchell ?
i' m sorry about goose .
everybody liked him .
i' m sorry .
hi , it' s wolfman .
maverick just quit .
excuse me ...
may l ?
please .
i' il have what he' s having .
hemlock , is it ?
ice water .
you weren' t gonna say goodbye ?
i heard you got that job in washington .
congratulations .
thanks .
but i wasn' t gonna leave without saying goodbye .
it' s good to see you .
thanks .
where are you going ?
you don' t even have a ticket , do you ?
listen , i' ve seen all the evidence , and it' s not your responsibility .
it' s not your fault .
you' re one of the best pilots in the navy .
what you do up there ...
it' s dangerous .
but you' ve got to go on .
you don' t understand .
when i first met you , you were larger than life .
look at you .
you' re not gonna be happy unless you' re going mach 2 with your hair on fire , you know that .
no , that' s over .
it' s just over .
to be the best of the best means you make mistakes and then you go on , it' s just like the rest of us .
you don' t think i know that ?
i' m here to help .
look , thank you .
but if i' d wanted help , really ...
i would have asked for it .
so , i' m too late .
you' ve already left .
you didn' t learn a damn thing , did you ?
except to quit .
you' ve got that manoeuvre down real well .
so long , pete mitchell .
oh , hi , maverick , come on in .
how are you doing ?
good yeah ?
sure you' re feeling okay ?
fine .
great .
jamie , come on .
can i get you a drink or anything else like that ?
no , thank you .
ok , why don' t you just uh ...
thank you very much .
make yourself comfortable , ' cuz mike will be right down , ok ?
ok .
thank you .
i flew with your old man .
vf 51 , the oriskany .
you' re a lot like he was .
only better ... ... and worse .
he was a natural heroic son of a bitch , that man .
so he did do it right .
yeah , he did it right .
is that why you fly the way you do ?
trying to prove something ?
yeah , your old man did it right .
what i' m about to tell you is classified .
it could end my career .
we were in the worst dogfight ever dreamed of .
there were ... bogeys like fireflies all over the sky .
his f 4 was hit , he was wounded , but he could have made it back .
he stayed in it ... ... saved three planes before he bought it .
how come i never heard that before ?
the battle occurred over the wrong line on some map .
so you were there ?
i was there .
what' s on your mind ?
my options , sir .
simple .
first , you' ve acquired enough points ... ... to show up tomorrow and graduate with your top gun class .
or you could quit .
there' il be no disgrace .
that spin was hell , it would have shook me up .
so you think i should quit ?
i didn' t say that .
the simple fact is , you feel responsible for goose .
and you have a confidence problem .
i' m not gonna sit here and blow sunshine up your ass , lieutenant .
a good pilot is compelled to always evaluate what' s happened ... ... so he can apply what he' s learned .
up there , we' ve got to push it .
that' s our job .
it' s your option , lieutenant .
all yours .
sorry to bother you on a sunday , sir , but thank you very much for your time .
no problem .
good luck .
gentlemen ...
where' s maverick ? .
i don' t know where he is .
you know what he' s planning to do ?
it' s got to be hard on the guy , though , you know .
congratulations .
thank you .
congratulations .
thanks , mav .
sir .
gentlemen , i hate to break up the party before it really gets out of hand ...
some of you have to depart immediately .
we have a crisis situation .
ice , slider ...
yo .
hollywood , wolfman .
yes , sir .
maverick .
sir .
maverick , you' il get your rlo when you get to the ship .
and if you don' t ... ... give me a call .
i' il fly with you .
gentlemen , this is bull' s eye .
the communication ship ss layton has become disabled and has wandered into foreign territory .
a rescue operation is to begin within the hour .
your mission is to give air support to that rescue .
there are migs in the area , and tensions are high .
if you witness a hostile act , you will return fire .
those mlgs carry the exocet anti ship missile .
they can fire that missile from a 100 miles away .
gentlemen , this is the real thing .
this is what you' ve been trained for .
you are america' s best .
make us proud .
