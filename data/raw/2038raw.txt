mrs. freeman knows what' s best for young minds .
which comes to my point .
i was wondering what you planned on doing with my file ?
it' s not very favorable and  and ... you' d prefer if i didn' t forward it to your new school .

sebastian , i would like you to meet the love of my life .
this is tiffany .
well , it' s a pleasure to finally meet you .
i see you have your father' s beautiful blue eyes .

my , what a precious little kitty you have .
would you like to pet her ?
some other time .
sebastian , come meet kathryn .
i' ve heard so much about you .
welcome to the family .
i' ve always wanted a brother , but they were sold out of them at bloomingdale' s .
is that a real steinway ?
i wouldn' t play anything else .
may i ?
be my guest .
kathryn is an exquisite pianist , sebastian .
really ?
cute .
i think it needs a tuning .
mother , sebastian must be famished .
shouldn' t we check on dinner ?
i think that' s a wonderful idea .
i' m so excited you' il be starting manchester with me tomorrow .
it' s a wonderful institution ...
with wonderful teachers .
wonderful .
kathryn is president of the student body .
let' s not forget president of the french club .
i live for extracurricular activities .
student body president ?
i thought you were a sophomore .
i am .
i believe one should not be hampered in achieving one' s goals ... simply by the paltriness of one' s years .
you mean " dearth .
excuse me .
well , paltriness implies insignificance ... but really it' s your lack of age that shouldn' t hamper you ... from achieving your goals .
careful with those sat words .
they can be deadly .
thank you .
isn' t kathryn just the best , son ?
yeah , she' s a real peach , dad .
i love you , step daddy .
i' m a little tired from all the travel .
do you mind if i turn in ?
not at all .
i know you have a big day ahead of you tomorrow .
i' il show you to your room .
hey , you little asshole .
what do you think you' re doing ?
i was not what ?
you hear me ?
get down there !
do not fuck with me .
so ... he outdoes you at piano , he outdoes you at vocabulary .
i guess i overestimated you .
and don' t sulk .
it' s a sign of weakness .
yes , mother .
no , everything' s fine .
i was just checking up on you , mom .
look , i promised i' d take care of you , right ?
well , i' m gonna talk to dad and get you into a better facility .
it' s the least he can do .
i love you too .
what the  let' s get something straight !
i may not have fooled you , but i' ve got a great thing going with the rentals .
i don' t have a curfew , they never bother me about my homework ... and i' ve got a five figure allowance .
no one and i mean no one is about to threaten my cushy lifestyle ... especially not some two bit hick loser .
but  i don' t wanna hear it .
now , as for school , you stay out of my face ... and we' il get along just fine , but if you cross me once ...
i' il bury your sorry ass , understood ?
all right .
i' m glad we could have this little discussion .
hmm .
not bad .
what' s the matter ?
this collar' s too tight .
oh , i guess you' re only used to wearing mesh shirts where you come from .
more sat vocabulary builders ?
for your information , this happens to be my orientation speech .
who are you orienting ?
please , be more stupid .
i am the student body president .
ivy league schools eat this extracurricular crap up for supper .
you do know what an ivy league school is ?
stop !
gordon anderson looking good .
do me a favor .
pretend you don' t know me .
my god , you' re beautiful .
excuse me ?
oh , i said you were beautiful .
thank you .
excuse me , but what did you mean by that remark ?
what remark ?
that i' m beautiful .
well , aren' t you ?
well , yeah .
i mean , no , no , but
never mind .
you' re very strange .
i know .
are you here to see the headmaster ?
yeah .
i heard he' s a total joke .
i wouldn' t know .
the headmaster will see you now .
i must say that in all my years in education ...
i have never seen a file quite like this .
4 . 0 gpa , president of several clubs ... all star snowboarding for your county ... as well as several glowing letters from your teachers ... including your former principal .
we were very close , he and i , sir .
yes , it' s most impressive .
thank you .
perhaps a little too impressive .
thank you .
that aside , i' m sure an enterprising young man like yourself ... would be a welcome addition here at manchester .
thank you , sir .
come in .
you had a few grammaticals , but nothing reprehensible .
thank you , honey .
sebastian , i' d like you to meet my daughter , danielle .
you' re both in the same class .
you look familiar .
have we met ?
no , i don' t think so .
are you sure ?
must' ve been someone else .
well , i' d better get going .
it was very nice meeting you , sir .
ma' am .
good luck , sebastian .
thank you , sir .
seems like a nice kid .
don' t you think ?
we' il see .
with our almamater we will grow
hail to thee o stars of pride
hail to thee
manchester
be seated .
we will now hear from your new student body president ...
kathryn merteuil .
fellow students , faculty , administrators and custodians ...
i would personally like to welcome each and every one of you ... to what i think will be manchester' s proudest year .
she is such an inspiration .
i consider ... each and every one of you ... members of my manchester prep family .
with that said , i feel it is our responsibility to ... reach out and accept all new students ... as members of
and accept all new students as
settle down , people .
please .
as i was saying , i consider each and every one of you ... members of my manchester prep
are you all right ?
sorry .
it happens when i get nervous .
guess i just need a bubble gum fix .
keep going .
you' re doing great .
thanks .
once again , as i was saying ...
i consider each and every one of you members ... of my manchester prep family .
with that said , i feel that it is our responsibility to reach out ... and accept all new students
somebody !
somebody do something !
somebody call 91 1 or something .
good going , danielle .
bravo !
terrific .
right .
sparing me the cliff notes synopsis .... who can tell me what this means ?
mr. winkler .
jekyil was a doctor ... and he developed this potion that transformed into ...
edward hyde , his evil side .
my gosh , did that answer suck .
now come on , i know you' ve got it in you .
what themes can be discussed here ?
miss sherman .
i think stevenson is talking about the duality of man .
man has both good and evil in him .
if man cannot suppress his evil instincts , he is inevitably doomed .
wrong !
care to elaborate on that ?
nowhere in the novel does stevenson mention good over evil .
in fact , it' s just the opposite .
jekyil loved hyde so much that he protected him from the world .
he protected hyde so he wouldn' t hurt people .
please .
he loved hurting people .
then why does jekyil kill himself ?
where does it say that in the book ?
the end !
mr. utterson found his body .
utterson was idiotic .
your point is idiotic .
all right , all right .
break it up , you two .
wow !
am i losing my mind ... or did we just witness an intellectual debate in this classroom ?
although i disagree with your conclusions , mr. valmont ...
i do appreciate your warped point of view .
as for you , miss sherman ...
i think you could be a little more tolerant of other people' s opinions .
hey , fellas , welcome back .
hey , rene , good to see you .
assistant headmaster mueller !
steve .
i thought i told you not to call me by my first name .
we need to talk .
later .
i' m busy right now .
stop that .
i said , we need to talk .
what is it ?
do you see something wrong ?
i have gym .
you know i loathe gym .
we merteuils do not like to perspire .
what is this " we merteuils " nonsense ?
you' re a student .
try acting like one .
excuse me ?
look , kathryn , rules are rules .
i' m sorry , but you' re going to gym .
i understand .
you do ?
yes .
but it' s a bit strange ...
' cause isn' t it against the rules for someone of your age to seduce a minor ...
like you did to me this summer in the hamptons ?
now you know that' s not entirely true .
it was you who seduced me .
you know , you' re right .
it was me who seduced you .
but then again , who will the school board believe ?
it' s my word against yours .
think about it , steve .
something like this could ruin your career ... not to mention your marriage .
but i guess if you can bend the rules a little , then so can i.
i' il see what i can do .
you' re the best .
this meeting of the manchester tribunal will now come to order .
kathryn merteuil presiding .
thank you , blaine .
fellow students of affluence and popularity ...
i welcome you to this year' s first meeting of the manchester tribunal .
as your new leader , i promise to do my best ... to weed out the geeks , losers and underprivileged ... and toss their fat asses out of our school .
here' s the latest shipment , mrs. gagin .
thank you .
could you re shelf these for me ?
thanks .
my god !
a cartoon cock ?
hi .
are you all right ?
you scared me to death .
you dropped this .
i didn' t drop it .
yes , you did , but it' s all right .
sexual curiosity is nothing to be ashamed of .
i' m not ashamed , and i have a very healthy sexual curiosity .
really ?
so what are you doing here ?
i work here .
do you think you can take a 1 5 minute break and join me for a cup of coffee ?
i' d love to , but unfortunately i have a lot of work to do around here .
mrs. gagin , do you mind if danielle joins me for a coffee break ?
please , go right ahead .
there' s nothing to do right now .
thank you .
you don' t quit , do you ?
whatever happened to " be nice to the new kid in school " ?
fifteen minutes .
go .
next .
michael keen , freshman .
former bmoc of his junior high school .
don' t let his bad acne dissuade you , though .
his father owns the coliseum .
let' s get him a facial and see if he can score front row tickets to hole .
next .
sebastian valmont , sophomore .
son of edward and corrine .
go on .
i can' t .
he' s a transfer student , and i don' t have any more information on him yet .
don' t you know anything else about him ?
he is your stepbrother .
i' ve only known him for a day .
he' s a total loser .
i mean , he shops at the gap .
stay on him and see what you can find out .
will do .
next .
cherie clayman , freshman .
daughter of hubert and bunny .
annual family income
well ? $850 million .
she' s richer than kathryn .
i heard that .
she has a gpa of 1 . 3 , and not only is she a virgin ... but she never even kissed a boy before .
okay , this girl is a walking teletubby ... just begging to be made an example of .
i think i' il oversee this one personally .
when i get through with her , she will be the premiere slut at manchester prep .
next order of business : grievances .
yes , lauren ?
well , it appears we' re having a bit of trouble with the new school chef .
mr. washington seems to think that sushi ... is an inappropriate meal for growing girls and boys .
all those in favor of sending mr. washington ... back to his hot dog stand , say aye .
aye !
aye .
okay , bye bye , mr. washington .
hello , mr. yakamoto .
so , what' s a nice girl like you doing at a snobbish school like manchester ?
it' s called free tuition .
besides , it' s not as bad as it seems .
my dad took over the place a year after my mom passed away .
i' m sorry .
your turn .
okay .
folks split up ten years ago .
mom has a drug problem .
and everyone thought it would be best if i moved in with my dad .
you get along with him ?
i don' t really know him .
he' s on his fourth marriage .
to kathryn' s mom ?
yeah .
i know this is rude , but what' s it like growing up with all that money ?
well , you know , i' m only one day into it .
sorry to disappoint you , my dear , but richie rich i' m not .
and i thought i was the only one at manchester .
you ever get the feeling you' re being watched ?
yours ?
hers .
there you are , silly goose .
i' ve been looking all over for you .
hi , danielle .
how' s the used bookstore ?
don' t let her get to you .
she doesn' t .
maybe it makes me uncool , but i don' t care what your stepsister thinks of me .
actually , i think that makes you very cool .
well , i' d better get going .
i don' t want her to make me hitch a ride home .
thanks for coffee .
yeah .
i' il call you later .
but you don' t have my number .
don' t underestimate me .
don' t underestimate kathryn .
let' s go .

can you come out tonight ?
it' s a school event .

a man has needs  look , dad , spare me the melodrama .

danielle , wait !
the best laid plans sometimes suck .
miss merteuil .
but i' m excused from gym .
gym , yes .
ballet , no .
well , there must be something i can do to change your mind .
i think you' ve got the wrong guy .
now get your ass to ballet .
mr. erwick .
i was very clear .
keep me out of gym ...
and ballet .
i can' t do anything , all right ?
hargrove called me into his office .
he' s suspicious , i heard it in his voice .
why do you think that is ?
well , i' m not sure .
the disciplinary committee , of course .
you stuttered and stammered like a completely whipped fool ... and then when you voted , it was obvious you voted the way i wanted you to vote .
but that' s how you did want me to vote .
oh , my god , i' m a mess .
you' re always one step ahead of me .
i don' t know what to do anymore .
it' s a dirty old man' s catch 22 .
shut up , steve .
get control of yourself .
i can' t .
i' m falling apart .
my wife doesn' t turn me on anymore , my kids hate me .
i should just quit .

i' il go back to gym and ballet .
you will ?
the excuse slips were just a test .
the day will come when i' il need you for a favor a big favor and you' il do it without question .
of course .
i worship you , kathryn .
worship works best on your knees , steve .
please be quiet .
i' m trying to imagine i' m with someone attractive .
sorry .
hello !
anybody !
oh , my god , she is terrible .
if it' s so bad here , why don' t you guys just quit ?
it' s steady employment , sir .
this is a good address .
we could be down in the 50s !
or worse , scarsdale .
ladies there make me crazy !
all the time sending me to the market looking for gefilte .
my father fisherman for 20 years he never caught one gefilte .
what is a gefilte ?
three kings .
man !
that beats my two pairs .
i got crap .
full house , jacks over threes .
you win again , master sebastian .
you know , henry , i really wish you' d quit with the " master " thing .
but sir , it' s your title .
it shows privilege .
yeah , well , what has it gotten me ?
i poured all my money into gifts and didn' t get the girl .
danielle hates my wealth or resents it or something .
perhaps it' s not my place to speak , sir .
no , henry , please .
i' m desperate here .
well , maybe she doesn' t want to feel like she' s being bought .
you think that' s it ?
i don' t know .
women are complicated .
it' s been my experience , sir , that women are more interested ... in the soul of a man than in his trappings .
what is going on around here ?
i had to ring and ring .
and where were you , frederick ?
i paged you four times .
i had to take a cab .
a cab !
i' m sorry , we were just
get out of here , all of you .
and you can be damned sure my mother' s gonna hear about this .
no , she won' t .
what did you say ?
you' re not telling anybody about this .
this was my idea .
i ordered them to play cards .
and to drink mother' s prized 1939 neufdu pape ?
great year .
blitzkrieg , wasn' t it ?
don' t get smart .
whether you realize it or not , you are still a guest in this house .
you know , you treat these people like dirt .
no wonder they don' t respect you .
we pay them for service , not respect .
maybe someday you' il learn that .
and one day you' il realize that they' re human beings .
just give me a second here .
party' s over .
you know , i don' t get it .
look , if you hate your mother so much ... why work so hard to be just like her ?
is that what you think i' m doing ?
well , you' re obviously trying to prove something to someone .
no one' s this mean , unless unless there' s a whole bunch of pain and suffering behind it .
you think you have it so tough , having to come into this strange house ... with strange people try growing up here .
try spending every moment of your life just making up for just being here .
that doesn' t make any sense .
no , it doesn' t , does it ?
you feel out of place , sebastian ?
you want to fit in ?
guess what .
so do i.
what a mess .
hello .
sebastian ?
it' s cherie .
news flash .
danielle is totally , madly in love with you .
madly in love with me ?
she hates me .
every move i make is the wrong move .
yeah , but she told me stuff ..
every time she thinks about you , every time she sees you , she gets all moist . " moist " ?
her eyes she gets tears in them .
but look , time' s running out .
you gotta move now .
she' il be in the city tonight dinner with her favorite aunt , riverside cafe .
i figure if you go there , bare your soul
no gifts though .
she hates that money thing .
hello ?
closet street performer .
now you know all my secrets .
how did you know i was here ?
nope .
already know .
cherie the blabbermouth .
weird girl , but if you get beyond all the " totallys " and " oh , my gods " ... there' s real truth there .
i have to catch my train .
let me come with .
i' il make sure you get home all right .
you can come as far as the station and only if you can do it without talking .
not another word that' s my condition .
condition accepted .
all right , all right !
stop !
i give up , okay ?
we can talk .
stop playing .
you know , i think this is the most romantic city on earth millions of strangers meeting in restaurants , parks , sidewalks a romance born every five seconds , every heartbeat .
i mean , god , is this a great city or what ?
this is exactly what i' m talking about .
you spout bs on a continuous basis .
only because i can' t say what i really want to say .
say it !
okay .
i wanna know what happened at school , in the courtyard .
i kissed you , and you just ran off .
i' m crazy about you !
i' m trying everything i can to make you like me .
be yourself .
be honest .
why is that so difficult ?
i don' t know .
maybe i' m scared .
you know , i' m new here , right ?
new to this city ... new at school ...
living in a house full of certifiable wackos ... and i don' t have any friends ... at least , any i can trust .
and i' m confused .
god' s honest truth , i' m in a state of perpetual confusion .
so what are you scared of ?
missing my train .
see you at school .
bye .
as you know , your mother gets home tonight .
and you want me to keep quiet about the poker game .
i don' t like these ideas sebastian' s putting in your head .
i mean no disrespect .
well , i' m offended .
leave .
i' il finish alone .
min lin , wait .
why don' t you and i get to know each other , like with sebastian last night ?
do i have to ?
come on , it' il be fun .
here .
i' il jump right in .
where are you from china , japan ?
cambodia actually .
cambodia wonderful country .
and when did you come to our united states ?
my family fled through vietnam .
ultimately , we were 1 20 crammed into a boat the size of your pantry .
oh , my gosh , that reminds me of this time in denver , coming home from aspen .
the first class lounge was packed .
we almost had to fly coach .
anyway , so your family fled the khmer rouge ?
nothing subtle about that shade of rouge .
see ?
we do have a lot in common .
will there be anything else , miss kathryn ?
no , that' s all .
i' m glad we did this , aren' t you ?
oh , yes .
very enlightening .
bitch .
you got all your pronouns mixed up .
nous " is " we .
vous " is " you .
unless it' s someone you' re crazy , madly in love with ... in which case it' s " tu , " as in you and sebastian .
i swear , that thing with the phone so cool .
i mean , if it had been me and some guy
i would have piddled right there on the spot .
oh , wait , did i show you my doodle ?
excuse me ?
my doodle , my sketch .
wow .
you' ve got some talent , cherie .
i mean , do you really like him ?
is this it ?
is it the real thing ?
like i even know what that is .
knees go weak , mouth goes dry ... you get that little tingling feeling in that special place .
he' s just so slick , so sure of himself .
i have a lot of trouble trusting him .
he can' t just come out and talk to me , say what he' s really feeling ... and neither can i.
okay , chapter three .
read the translation of the first passage . " love is a sublime melting pot in which men and women are fused together .
the lover is a priest , the ravished virgin a trembling sacrifice .
a priest and a virgin ?
that' s sick !
move .
move .
hi , mr. nagao !
hello , ladies !
i make a special eel and cuke roll today .
it' s so sad about mr. washington .
i mean , the fact that they found a dead rat in that student' s sloppy joe .
he' il never work again .
so , you never told us how it went with cherie .
did you bury her ?
let' s say she' s on her way to ruin .
everything' s set for this weekend .
what are you talking about ?
uh , duh .
i told my mom how much fun we had ... and she invited you and your mom over for nonfat lattes .
your mom told my mom that you can sleep over .
i got the new hanson album !
okay , i gotta go .
gordon anderson promised he' d show me his one eyed snake , whatever that is .
okay , see you .
wow , kathryn , you really showed her .
don' t talk .
don' t say a word .
it' s my turn to explain .
all i' ve done is hound you about being honest ... when i couldn' t do it myself .
that kiss in the courtyard , sebastian it was more than just a kiss .
i' il say .
no , let me finish .
you see ... it was my first kiss .
i wanted it to be perfect and right and with the right boy ... and , while you might have been the right boy , the rest was totally not right .
i embarrassed you .
i embarrassed myself .
because i know you' re used to girls with all this experience ... and you' ve probably been kissing girls forever ... and that' s what i was afraid to tell you .
i happen to think this is wonderful , all right ?
so you weren' t exactly up front and honest .
join the club .
i wanted it to be perfect ... not the tail end of some prank .
does that make any sense ?
yeah .
you know , some things can' t be orchestrated .
some things have to be spontaneous , like a kiss .
like the kiss we' re about to have right now .
say something , quick .
i can' t .
i have to go .
last bell .
okay , but ... just back away so i know you' re not running away .
that was wonderful just precious .
how long were you there ?
i' ve never kissed a boy before i mean , the right boy ... and you' ve probably been kissing girls forever .
you must feel like a terrible dope , leading on that poor , lovesick girl .
you don' t know what you' re talking about .
a few weeks of hand holding and chaste smooching ... and you' il be so bored and horny you' il mess the whole thing up .
of course , i could wipe her off the map tomorrow .... but i think i' il let this little romance just flicker out all on its own .
i like the girl , okay ?
i like her a lot .
you screw it up , and i' il screw you up .
nobody ever threatens me .
i just did or weren' t you listening ?
you do realize this means war .
then war it is .
lovely .
well , i feel badly for you , i really do ... but byron needs to be groomed every day at 3 : 00 .
well , you' il just have to reschedule your daughter' s birthday .
now , i want him saddled and ready to ride when i arrive .
don' t keep me waiting .
idiot !
there' s a new student at manchester cherie clayman .
did she die ?
i take it you don' t like her .
i can' t stand her .
she' s actually very sweet , so i' m turning her into the school slut .
well , she' s now your new best friend .
why ?
you' re not hitting up the claymans for a donation to manchester .
sorry , mother .
i think it' s an excellent idea .
the claymans will join us at 7 : 00 .
you invited them here ?
mother , they' re from california .
kathryn , i need this .
just 20 million more and we can break ground on the tiffany merteuil library .
well , you ladies seem to be enjoying yourselves .
you must be tense , sebastian .
yeah , well , you' d be too if you were failing gym .
i mean , who ever heard of fencing as a sport ?
perhaps a massage would help .
i' ve never had a massage before .
you can have my table .
i' m suddenly not in the mood .
mycket , " not " myckesh .
kathryn , if you' re not going to say it correctly , don' t say it at all .
it just makes you look foolish .
thank you for the correction , mother .
now , if you' il excuse me .
i think i could get used to this .
hi .
dead puppies , dead puppies , dead puppies ... old nuns in their underwear
i thought you' d left .
is that sonja or ingrid ?
it' s tiffany .
i hope you enjoyed your massage .
i think i' il go take a shower .
we' ve had so little time together , sebastian .
we can' t be a happy family if we don' t get to know each other a little better .
you' re right , mom .
we should talk more , mom .
with your father working on the yacht so much , i' il have plenty of time for you .
you know , some nights he doesn' t even come home .
he loves that yacht .
i' m glad he found something he' s so committed to .
well , the right woman will do that .
and you think i' m the right woman ?
definitely .
he' s a changed man .
of course .
without me he' d still be in miami giving charters to geriatrics .
it' s not the money , it' s you .
he loves you .
you' re a smart boy , sebastian .
you seem to understand your father very well .
i hope so .
so do i , because if you' re wrong , you' re both going to end up out on the street .
she spanked me .
oh , baby .
oh , that feels so good .
oh , yeah , you like that , huh ?
dad , you here ?
fuck !
fuck !
hey , son , how' s it goin ' ?
in bed already ?
oh , it' s just a catnap .
what are you doing ?
oh , i' m just looking for the cat .
here , puss , puss , puss , puss , puss .
i hope you' re not suggesting i' m having an affair .
i' m not suggesting anything .
i' m your father ... and i will not be treated like a criminal !
criminal .
you could have fooled me .
and behind door number three we have
hello .
sebastian , meet lilly ... my first mate .
lilly , i' m sebastian , edward' s son .
oh , my god , you have your father' s eyes .
are you a libra ?
let' s just cut right to the chase , shall we ?
he offered to sail you around the world , didn' t he ?
how did you know ?
leave right now , or you' re grounded for a week .
did he tell you he' s married ?
i was waiting for the right time .
you lied to me ?
more an error of omission .
you see , she' s very sick .
i may be single any day now .
go to hell !
sebastian , you think you could help me out here ?
okay , okay , i know we talked about this ... but you' re a man , and you have to understand
you have to understand .
it' s not just your life anymore , dad , it' s mine too .
don' t screw it up for me .
absolutely .
you can count on me , son .
the keys , please ?
you know , you made your bed .
now lie in it .
well , this sucks .
i can' t believe i was so stupid .
i really thought your dad liked me .
it' s not your fault .
he' s the master of deceit .
he should be in the pathological liars ' hall of fame .
he was in the hall of fame ?
never mind .
can i ask you something ?
sure .
why are men such jerks ?
i mean , is it genetic or something ?
you know , they promise you the world , that you' re the one for them ... and that their wives don' t understand them anymore .
and i fall for it every time .
i' m like a doormat .
they' re always coming and going ... and coming and going , and coming and
my life sucks .
lilly , you don' t need a man to be happy .
if you' re not happy alone , you' re not gonna be happy with someone else .
you' re a very attractive woman .
you could have anyone you want .
you just have to wait for the right guy to come along .
you think i' m attractive ?
i think you' re beautiful .
you' re so sincere .
you' re not like your father at all .
okay .
glad you were paying attention .
do you wanna come back to my place ?
i' d love to , but i have an oral report due in the morning .
oh , i' m great at orals .
yeah .
try me .
no , thank you .
listen , i' m gonna split .
are you gonna be okay ?
yeah , i' il be fine .
psycho .
i lived in fresnomy whole life .
les too .
but we wanted more for cherie , so when les sold the biz ... we decided to move to the big apple .
and how are you finding manchester ?
oh , it' s no problem .
our driver he takes me right there .
she' s asking you if you like it , honey .
oh , yeah , it' s the best .
and kathryn' s been , like , so super nice .
you know , some girls they told me to stay away from her ...
like she had permanent pms or something .
ew , gross !
but she' s been , like , totally awesome !
i can tell she' s going to be very popular .
oh , i won' t be as popular as you . " popular " is such a bore .
the important thing is school spirit , and nobody has as much as my mother .
i do a little work for the school fund raising committee .
you are so modest .
mother' s already raised half the money needed for the new school library .
how much money have you raised ?
well , she barely has to do anything .
the parents practically throw it at her .
why do they throw money at you ?
because charity is smiled upon by the ladies who lunch .
society , cherie .
you know the social ladder ?
oh , yeah .
my mom said now that we' re rich ... we gotta start climbing that thing .
ow !
what ?
isn' t she precious ?
would you excuse me ?
pardon me .
certainly .
so , how much money do you need ?
oh , i didn' t invite you over here to discuss fund raising , bunny ... but if you' d care to make a donation , we' d certainly consider it .
really ?
why , thank you .
my pleasure .
oh , hi , honey .
how was your day ?
i can explain this .
there' s no need to explain .
i know you love my mother very much .
yes .
exactly .
and sebastian and i are just getting close .
i know you' d never do anything to break up our happy home .
oh , no , never .
so let' s make sure it stays happy .
i want you to take mother to dinner at au troquet for dinner tomorrow night .
i' il make reservations at 8 : 00 .
at 8 : 45 , an accordion player will pass by .
when he does , request " under my thumb " by the rolling stones .
mick jagger makes mother all hot and bothered .
jagger .
got it .
while she' s listening ... slip this on her finger , then kiss her eight seconds , no tongue .
are you getting all this ?
after dinner , grappa one glass then bring her home , make love to her two viagra any questions ?
just in case , i' ve written it all down for you .
now , who' s your favorite daughter ?
you are .
what a shame .

great day , isn' t it ?
bite me , rich boy !
ah , new york a wonderful town .
you look fabulous .
thank you .

yeah .
you ought to take some money , just in case you need a cab , miss the train
don' t worry , dad .
i' il be fine .
come on , this is my job to worry .
what' s wrong ?
nothing .
just thought about your mom .
go on .
have a good time .
okay .
bye .
bye .
sebastian thought you' d like it better than the train .
wow .
i am so excited .
you know , i' m kind of nervous .
i' ve never been on a horse before .
don' t worry .
i won' t let anything bad happen to you .
if i like it , then i' il have daddy buy me a horse ... then we can spend every weekend together .
you' il love it .
i promise .
very good , cherie .
back on the horse now .
i think we' re ready to try advanced jumping .
i don' t know .
he keeps throwing me off .
all right .
if you' re going to be a scaredy cat ...
i guess we' d better go back to the basics manuela ?
nice horsey .
okay .
now , using the stirrups ...
i want you to push up and down in the saddle that' s called posting .
now we need to add the back and forth motion .
when you hit the saddle , push backward , then forward .
up and down , back and forth , faster , faster .
up and down , back and forth , faster , faster .
good .
this time i want you to really grind into the saddle .
okay .
up and down , back and forth ... faster , faster .
how does that feel ?
okay .
up and down .
i think i' m getting it .
posting is fun .
faster , faster .
really fun .
are you okay ?
i' ve never felt better .
now i know why girls like horses .
wait .
i don' t know if i' m ready for this .
it' s cool .
i' m sorry .
it' s just that yesterday was my first kiss ... and now you' re practically touching my breast .
at this rate , your dick will be in my mouth by lunch .
anyone for lunch ?
i' m kidding .
i' m kidding .
listen , danielle , we can take this as slow as you want .
i like you .
i' ve no need to rush things .
that' s not my problem .
i want to rush things .
i' m tired of being the only virgin in the sophomore class at manchester .
are you telling me that everyone in the sophomore class has done it ?
well , it sure feels like it .
i don' t know .
ever feel like you' re at war with yourself ?
constantly .
i mean , there' s one side of me ... that wants you to throw me down right here and rip my clothes off .
then there' s this other side of me that thinks i should wait till i' m married .
which side should i choose , sebastian ?
you really want me to answer that ?
come on , be my friend .
listen , danielle ...
i know exactly what you' re going through .
we all have two sides .
i struggle with my dark side every day .
but that was the old me .
believe it or not , i have you to thank for it .
you showed me that it was okay to be a decent person .
how dark was your past ?
pitch black .
i' m thinking
i think i' m falling in love with you .
but i' m afraid to take the chance to get hurt .
i' m afraid of getting hurt too .
listen , let' s make a pact .
we' il take it slow , and we won' t hurt each other .
god , we sound like a cancelled television series .
you don' t have to do this .
i want to .
hello ?
hi , daddy .
i know , i' m running late .
tell aunt gloria we can still make the 2 : 00 mass .
yeah , i' il call you when i get there .
i love you too .
you gotta go ?
it' s okay .
sorry .
call me later ?
sure .
okay .
toodles .
bye bye .
oh , my balls .
here' s something you might like .
dolce .
how ' 98 of you .
do you carry any real fur ?
no , all of our fur is faux .
of course .
the animals how silly of me .
i figured you' d be here .
what' s up ?
it' s about sebastian .
give me the dirt .
your stepbrother has quite the checkered past .
i mean , the fact that he was able to pay off that overnight delivery guy ... and switch his school file ?
that' s impressive even by my standards .
that' s just the tip of the iceberg .
well done .
cash or charge ?
i' il be there in an hour .
sounds great .
the new james van der beek film' s playing in town .
perfect .
you' re sure your dad won' t mind ?
no , he' s out of town for the night .
it' s just me and mr. whiskers . " mr. whiskers " ?
my pussy , silly .
okay , well , i' il see you soon .
all right .
bye .
the school virgin' s home alone with her pussy , and i' m taking her to see dawson .
god , i' ve become a total fag .
i guess i misjudged you .
what are you talking about ?
how' d you get this ?
i have my ways .
kathryn , i' m trying to start over  oh , blah , blah , blah , blah , please .
spare me any sob stories .
oh , dear .
i guess something like this ... could destroy your squeaky clean reputation at manchester .
and that school psychologist' s report about your mom it' s too bad .
how will she pay for rehab when i tell mommy where some of her money' s going ?
you' re playing with fire , kathryn .
poor sebastian' s mom is going to be ... homeless and eating leftovers out of the garbage .
you don' t know what i' m capable of .
yes , i do .
i read your file .
it turns me on .
fuck off .
going to see danielle ?
leave her out of it !
looks like we' ve hit a sensitive spot .
do you really think you can change , sebastian ?
you and i are two of a kind .
we' re just not cut out for good deeds .
i know the drill .
you' il date danielle ... probably sleep with her after what you think eight months ?
and then you' il get bored , and you' il break her heart .
why don' t you just spare her the pain ?
and do what ?
date you ?
we could make a good team .
what do you plan on doing with my file ?
do i sense a merger in the air ?
perhaps .
you do realize you' re my stepsister .
you know what they say about incest .
is there any line you won' t cross ?
only one : never in the butt .
that' s a good line .
the bradys never had it so good .
i can' t do this .
not with your pants on .
i gotta go .
you fucking pussy !
i gotta get outta this house .
what , is this about danielle ?
you don' t understand , kathryn .
i love her .
you have a funny way of showing it .
fuck you .
i won' t let you corrupt me .
don' t you see ?
you can' t change .
i can try .
well , you' re gonna die trying .
hello ?
hello , danielle ?
sebastian , you' re soaking .
we have to talk .
well , come inside before you catch yourself pneumonia .
here .
thanks .
what' s wrong ?
i don' t know , it' s
it' s okay .
you can talk to me .
go slow .
i just i feel like i' m losing it .
you know , i gotta get outta new york .
i gotta get outta school .
it' s kathryn , isn' t it ?
i don' t think i can beat her .
sebastian , do you believe in a higher power ?
yeah .
do you believe that love conquers all ?
yes .
do you believe in our love ?
yeah .
it' s the only thing keeping me together .
so you believe in our love ?
yes , i believe in our love .
' cause i sure as hell don' t .
what ?
fucking idiot .
bravo .
i told you i could do it .
i should never have doubted you .
don' t tell me you bought that virgin bullshit .
no , i saw you .

what he doesn' t know can' t hurt him .
i am the headmaster' s daughter .
daddy' s little angel must keep up appearances .
holy fuck .
