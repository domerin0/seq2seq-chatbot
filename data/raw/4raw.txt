you probably made it up .
if you had to work , i would understand .
that' s because you' re not as romantic as i am .
ohh .

because if i go with you , i' il resent the fact that i' m there .
if i stay here , i' il miss you , but you' il feel guilty .
i like that better .

it' s only for one night , hubby .
say that again .

there' s a radio navigation beacon on the top of tamitange .
we find it .
we shut it down .
they come out and fix it .
we' re rescued .
it took ' em two years to fix the streetlight outside my apartment .
wow .
