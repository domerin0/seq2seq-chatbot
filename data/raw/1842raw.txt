you got him !
you got him !
only ever met one man i wouldn' t want to fight .
i can' t stop that .
here .
get out of here , you useless tit .
when i met him , he was already the best cut man in the business .
can you stop it ?
started training and managing in the ' 60s , but he never lost his gift .
no .
let me have a look at him .
he' s fine .
he' s fine .
well , he ain' t if you don' t stop this bleeding .
i' il give you one more round .
seconds out .
let' s go .
what do we do ?
tell me what to do .
you let him hit you .
sometimes , there' s just nothing you can do .
cut' s too wide , too close to the bone ...
maybe you got a severed vein ... or you just can' t get the coagulant deep enough .
there are all kinds of combinations you come up against down in the different layers of meat , and frankie knew how to work every one .
people love violence .
they slow down at a car wreck to check for bodies .
same people claim to love boxing .
they got no idea what it is .
boxing is about respect getting it for yourself ... ... and taking it away from the other guy .
i' il warm up the car .
mr dunn ?
hmm .
i owe you money ?
no , sir .
i know your mama ?
don' t rightly know , sir .
then what is it you want ?
i was on the undercard .
i won my fight , to0 .
maggie fitzgerald .
well , maggie fitzgerald , what' s up ?
did you happen to see it ?
nope .
i did pretty good .
thought you might be interested in training me .
i don' t train girls .
maybe you should .
people see me fight say i' m pretty tough .
girlie , tough ain' t enough .
it' s a mistake .
car should be able to back up , frankie .
just push , will you ?
what did hogan want ?
offered us a title shot .
' bout time .
i turned him down flat .
two or three more fights , you' il be ready .
been two or three more fights for a long time now , frankie .
look , willie , you get one shot at the title .
you lose it , it may not come around again .
now , two or three more fights , and we' il be ready .
whatever you say , frankie .
frankie liked to say that boxing is an unnatural act , that everything in boxing is backwards .
sometimes ... best way to deliver a punch is step back .
well , do your best , lord , to ... protect katy .
annie , to0 .
other than that ... you know what i want .
there' s no use me repeating myself .
but step back too far , you ain' t fightin ' at all .
thank you for your prayers .
bye .
goodbye .
hey , father , that was a great sermon .
made me weep .
what' s confusing you this week ?
oh , it' s the same old one god , three god thing .
frankie , most people figure out by kindergarten it' s about faith .
is it sort of like snap , crackle and pop all rolled up in one big box ?
you' re standing outside my church comparing god to rice krispies ?
you only come to mass every day to wind me up .
it' s not going to happen this morning .
well , i' m confused .
no , you aren' t .
yes , i am .
there' s one god .
anything else ?
cos i' m busy .
what about the holy ghost ?
an expression of god' s love .
and jesus ?
son of god .
don' t play stupid .
well , what is he , then ?
does that make him a demigod ?
there are no demigods , you fuckin ' pagan !
did you write to your daughter ?
absolutely .
now you' re lying to a priest .
you know what ?
take a day off .
don' t come to mass tomorrow .
some people' d say the most important thing a fighter can have is heart .
frankie' d say , " show me a fighter with nothing but a heart and i' il show you a man waiting for a beating .
think i only ever met one fighter who was all heart .
my name' s dangerous dillard
fightin ' flippo bam bam barch out of broward county , texas !
danger showed up a couple of years back .
he' d come visiting l. a. with ervel , his mama' s new boyfriend .
apparently , ervel got lost and ended up back in texas .
danger looked for him for about a week ' fore he introduced himself .
hey .
you know , i gots nothin ' against niggers ...
well , that' s nice to hear .
yeah .
yeah .
lots of people where i comes from does , but my mama taught me not to cause hurt to no man , niggers or not .
you got a nice mama .
anything else i can do for you ?
just one of those questions , but danger wanted to give it his best answer .
well , sir , i' d likes to become the welterweight champion of the world .
and i challenge the motor city cobra , thomas " hit man " hearns , to fight me for the welterweight championship of the whole world !
yo , flip , shut up , man !
you ain' t even ranked .
you got to have at least one fight to be ranked .
hey , i' il fight any man , anytime !
hey , you a bad man , huh ?
hey , come on , get in the ring .
go a round with me .
shawrelle ...
i will .
leave him alone .
danger , you goon back to training .
will do , mr scrap .
ow !
them some nice tights , danger .
i' il give you that ass whoopin ' later , olive oyl .
those pants look real pretty on you , bro .
give his mama back her tights .
shawrelle berry had a left hook that would move a tank ... but he had a heart the size of a split pea .
frankie bought the hit pit from bobby malone 17 years ago .
bobby wanted to move to florida , and frankie wanted some security .
bobby died while he was packing .
frankie found out ... most gyms lose money .
i thought i told you i didn' t want danger working out here anymore .
oh , he ain' t hurtin ' nothin ' , frankie .
well , he' s hurtin ' me .
breakin ' my heart watchin ' him punch the air like it' s going to punch back .
and how many times have i got to tell you that bleach is bleach ?
why can' t you just buy the cheap stuff ?
you don' t always have to buy expensive stuff .
it smells better , frankie .
bleach smells like bleach .
hey , scrap .
hey , mr willie .
hey , nice fight last night .
big willie .
hey , sally .
nice fight .
thanks , man .
people are talkin ' .
ta cul fionn is dha shuil ghlasa agat " .
what the hell kind of language is that ?
what do you want ?
i just thought you might like to know you got a fighter out there not talking to another manager .
not talking to another manager ?
not just any manager .
mickey mack .
you came in here to tell me that big willie is not talking to mickey mack .
not a word .
neither one of ' em .
i' m trying to read here .
well , if you think that' s more important ...
who' s your new girl ?
what ?
jesus christ .
better hurry up .
if she keeps hitting it like that , she gonna break her wrists .
you' re wasting your time .
i told you i don' t train girls .
thought you might change your mind .
there' s dozens of trainers who train girls .
you won' t have any trouble finding one .
don' t hardly need a dozen , boss .
you' il do fine .
don' t call me boss , now .
i' m not your boss , and don' t you be calling me that .
willie , you ready to work ?
anytime .
if i stop calling you boss , will you train me ?
no .
i might as well just keep calling you it .
she came from southwestern missouri ... the hills outside the scratch ass ozark town of theodosia , set in the cedars and oak trees somewhere between nowhere and good bye .
she was trash .
it' s for my dog .
she' d come 1, 800 miles , but theodosia was still just over the hill .
workin ' the bag , boss .
not your boss ... and that bag' s working you .
give her her money back .
you sure ?
how much did she pay ?
six months .
oh , jesus christ .
no , i' il just give it back .
no .
don' t be a smart ass now , will you ?
woman thinks i' d throw away six months ' dues just to get rid of her , she' s out of her mind .
but just don' t encourage her , understand ?
ok .
and ...
and what' s danger doing out there ?
what' s he lookin ' at ?
looks like a bottle of water .
he paid his dues ?
dues ?
boy can' t afford pants .
want him to pay dues ?
get out of my office .
fuck me .
can' t think of it as a bag .
i' m not a trainer , but i can show you this , if you' d like .
appreciate any help i can get .
ok .
let' s see .
what you want to do is you want to think of it as a man , see ?
and he' s constantly moving .
he' s moving towards you .
he' s moving around you .
he' s moving away from you , all right ?
you don' t want to hit him when he' s coming towards you cos what he' s going to do is push you back .
he' s going to smother your punches , take your balance , right ?
so watch him carefully .
keep rotating , that keeps your head moving , and keep one shoulder back so you' re always ready to fire a power shot .
right ?
go ahead , now .
good , good .
keep rotating .
keep moving .
that' s it .
good , good .
keep that chin tucked in .
come on around .
keep moving , keep moving .
good , good , good , good .
like that ?
yeah .
keep on moving , give it a few shots .
tuck that chin in , now .
tuck that chin in .
that' s good .
that' s good .
now , you get this down , we' il put you on the speed bag .
you do have a speed bag ?
i' il just borrow it till i can buy my own .
all right , you goon home now .
i' il walk out with you ?
no , i am home .
want to see ?
yeah .
it' s nice .
would it bother you much if i worked a little longer ?
no , just ... pull the door closed when you leave .
thank you .
if there' s magic in boxing , it' s the magic of fighting battles beyond endurance , beyond cracked ribs , ruptured kidneys and detached retinas .
it' s the magic of risking everything for a dream that nobody sees but you .
ok , come on .
watch the footwork .
hey , flip .
hey , flippy , come here , man .
i think i found somebody you can beat .
i don' t fights women .
why not , bro ?
it' s perfect , bro , cos you know why ?
cos she nah , you you could fight to him and then you could kiss to him , and then you could fight to him one more time .
that' s beautiful , man .
that' s like poetry .
it' s like poetry .
you been reading and shit .
thanks , bro .
that' s a girl , man ?
i' il be damn , flip .
i think you right .
look at her little bitty titties .
they' re like mosquito bites .
geez , man , there' s barely even a mouthful .
saw your last fight , shawrelle .
spent so much time face down , i thought the canvas had titties .
oh !
oh !
canvas has titties .
hey , look at me .
i' m shawrelle .
just humping the canvas .
humping the floor .
come on , bro , the floor is having titties ?
that' s funny , bro .
shut up , man .
what you laughing at ?
man , hold the bag , stupid .
yo , when they start making those tights for men , flippy ?
punk .
all right , that' s enough .
that' s enough for the day .
i' il give you a rubdown .
oh , i can' t , frankie .
my middle one' s got a piano lesson .
i told gracie i' d drive her .
oh .
something wrong with gracie' s car ?
she hates that car .
wants the old one back , but the dealer won' t do it .
said he' s already got a buyer .
maybe i should talk to the dealer .
i' d appreciate that .
ok .
thanks .
see you later .
the man' s a rubdown whore .
today he doesn' t want one ?
you ever do any work around here ?
not my job i' d worry about , if i was you .
little girl seems to be coming along .
yeah .
it' s almost like someone' s been helping her .
she might just be a natural .
looks like she' s got something .
she' s got my speed bag , that' s what she' s got .
i wonder how the hell she got that .
i wonder .
i' m going to need that speed bag back .
this bag ?
yes , that bag .
that' s my bag , and if you' re hitting it , people will think i' m training you .
is that such a bad thing , boss ?
yes , yes , it is .
every time you touch it , you' re losing me business out here .
i gotta agree , i am embarrassing myself .
yeah .
well , i can' t just lend it to anybody , you know .
i understand .
yeah .
look , you seem like a nice girl .
can i give you some advice ?
i' d appreciate that .
you' re going to find a trainer , either here or somewhere else , that' s going to want to train a girl .
it' s the latest freak show out there .
but the trouble is , they' re going to be wasting your time because you' re to00ld .
i don' t feel that old .
well , neither do i , but you don' t see me fighting 21 year olds , do you ?
takes about four years to train a fighter .
how old are you ?
31 ... until my next birthday .
oh , well , there you go .
31 .
you wouldn' t start training to be a ballerina at 31 , now , would you ?
already been working it for three years .
and you can' t hit a speed bag ?
what kind of training is that ?
i' ve never had any , boss .
well , i hate to say it , but it shows .
somebody' s gotta be honest with you .
i hate to be the one to tell you the truth .
yeah .
well , sorry for using your bag , mr dunn .
you' re not going to cry now , are you ?
no , sir .
yeah .
here .
keep the goddamn thing .
no , you need it .
no , take the bag .
i haven' t seen it in 20 years , anyway .
i' ve had three since then .
just uh ... just enjoy it , will you ?
i' il just borrow it till i buy my own .
yeah .
just don' t lose it .
yeah , i know , hogan .
your guy' s the champ , so we don' t split fifties .
but if i don' t see 40 % ...
look , you call me back when it' s 60 40 , or don' t call me back at all .
hey , willie .
hey , frankie .
is something wrong ?
i' m sorry to come by your house like this .
i i know you don' t like people dropping in .
oh , you' re not people , willie .
you' re welcome anytime .
come on in .
i want to thank you for getting gracie' s car back .
oh , well , you don' t have to thank me .
paying an extra thousand dollars for your own car ain' t exactly a favour .
gracie broke out and cried when she saw it .
really ?
i also needed to talk with you about business .
oh , well , i just got off the phone with hogan .
we' re all set for september .
everything but the split .
i gotta leave you , frankie .
what ?
willie , the ... the title is just two fights away .
it ain' t that .
it' s ...
it' s like you said , i got one shot .
if i win , i gotta make as much as i can while i can .
i need somebody in the action , who can make things happen .
and i gotta make the change before the fight .
only way this guy say he' d take me is if he took me to the title .
so , i get you to the title fight , and this guy takes you there ?
only way he' d do it .
i' m sorry , frankie .
i know how long you' ve been waiting on a title .
i wish it could' ve been with me .
mickey mack' s a businessman .
he can' t teach you nothing .
you already taught me everything i need to know .
there' s some things people just don' t want to hear .
and i challenge the motor city cobra , thomas " hit man " hearns , to fight me for the welterweight championship of the whole world .
danger , i' m wearing these mitts for a reason .
just working on my footwork , mr scrap .
danger , you throw a punch or get the hell out of this gym .
danger , while you thinking about that punch , i' il be right back .
i' m ...
i' m thinking how i' m gonna hit it hard for you , mr scrap .
no one had the heart to tell danger that hearns retired years ago .
i heard about willie .
that' s cold .
that' s dead cold .
course , it wouldn' t be so bad if you weren' t so damn old .
yeah .
at least i can see through both eyes .
yeah , mm hm .
didn' t do you a lot of good though , did it ?
well , i' ve got the gym .
don' t need to be training fighters at my age .
willie tell you why ?
it was mickey .
mickey' s got the connections .
it ain' t about connections , frank .
it' s about you not believing in him .
well , i found him .
i stuck with him for eight years .
how' s that for not believing in him ?
you could' ve got him a title fight two years ago .
hell , he knew that .
i' m amazed he stayed this long .
yeah , well , getting there and taking home the belt are two different things .
what was i supposed to do , just put him in over his head , not protect him ?
oh , you were protecting him from the championship ?
yeah .
oh , well , now it makes sense .
well , what about you , scrap ?
what did your manager do ?
you were a hell of a fighter , a lot better than willie .
he get you a title fight or did he just bust you out , banging your head against other people' s fists until you lost your eye ?
i had my shot .
i went out swinging and no man can say i didn' t .
yeah , well , i remember .
and excuse me if i didn' t want my fighter spending the second half of his life cleaning up other people' s spit .
yeah , right .
right .
you' re the smart one .
you' re the one learning greek .
it' s gaelic .
well , you just protected yourself out of a championship fight .
how do you say that in gaelic ?
sorry .
thanks .
boxing is an unnatural act ... cos everything in it is backwards .
you want to move to the left , you don' t step left , you push on the right toe .
to move right , you use your left toe .
instead of running from the pain , like a sane person would do , you step into it .
oh , my god !
he hits the champ with a right hand and the champ' s down !
ladies and gentlemen , the ref has ended the count .
and big willie jones is the new champion of the world !
it' s unbelievable how this has taken place tonight .
but there you have it , folks , a new champion .
everything in boxing is backwards .
want a cheeseburger ?
you bought me a cheeseburger ?
yeah .
i never seen you buy anybody a cheeseburger .
well , i couldn' t eat it , and i ordered it .
you want it ?
well , i guess the planet can go back to spinning .
you watch the fight ?
yeah , i watched it .
willie did good .
that' s what you' ve got to say ?
well , he won , didn' t he ?
he did good .
i see you been working on yourself , learning to open up .
that' s good work .
you watch it ?
yeah , i got hbo .
how can you afford hbo ?
how long have i been telling you to save your money ?
ever since i fought louis " typhoon " johnson at the stadium club in tupelo , mississippi .
that true ?
yeah .
manager ran off and left you and me to hitch home .
don' t you remember nothing ?
well , i remember walking halfway , and thinking i was going to be lynched .
i remember you leaving me with my dick in my hand behind that gas station .
yeah , well , i got a ride .
the guy took off before i hardly closed the door .
i had to walk back two miles .
your conscience got the better of you , that' s what .
hmm .
what the hell' s that ?
it' s her birthday .
you' re not breathing right .
that' s why you' re panting .
so , it' s your birthday , huh ?
how old does that make you ?
i' m 32 , mr dunn ... and i' m here celebrating the fact that i spent another year scraping dishes and waitressing , what i' ve been doing since 13 .
and according to you , i' il be 37 ' fore i can even throw a decent punch ... which after working this speed bag for a month and getting nowhere ,
i now realise may be god' s simple truth .
other truth is , my brother' s in prison , my sister cheats on welfare by pretending one of her babies is still alive , my daddy' s dead , and my mama weighs 312 pounds .
if i was thinking straight , i' d go back home , find a used trailer , buy a deep fryer and some oreos .
the problem is , this is the only thing i ever felt good doing .
if i' m to00ld for this , then i got nothing .
that enough truth to suit you ?
this your speed bag ?
put yours behind the counter .
wish i could say i wore it out .
ok .
just hold it , hold it .
i' il show you a few things , and then we' il get you a trainer .
no .
sorry .
you' re in a position to negotiate ?
yes , sir , because i know if you train me right , i' m going to be a champ .
i seen you looking at me .
yeah , out of pity .
don' t you say that !
don' t you say that if it ain' t true !
i want a trainer .
i don' t want charity , and i don' t want favours .
if you' re not interested , then i got more celebrating to do .
stop , stop , stop .
goddamn it , stop .
what the hell are you doing ?
ok .
if i' m going to take you on ...
you won' t never regret it .
look , just listen to me .
if i take you on ...
i promise i' il work so hard .
god , this is a mistake already .
mm mm .
i' m listening , boss .
if i take you on , you don' t say anything .
you don' t question me .
you don' t ask why , you don' t say anything except maybe , " yes , frankie " .
and i' m going to try to forget the fact that you' re a girl .
it' s all i ask .
and don' t come crying to me if you get hurt .
all righty .
we got a deal .
no , not quite .
i' m going to teach you how to fight .
then , we' il get you a manager , and i' m off down the road .
i hate to argue with you , but ...
don' t argue , it' s the only way we' re doing it .
i teach you all you need to know , and then you go off and make a million dollars .
i don' t care .
you get your teeth knocked out , i don' t care .
i don' t want to hear about it either way , that' s how it is .
it' s the only way i' il do it .
all right .
now , one of the things i' ve noticed around the gym is , you never move your feet .
you stand there just flatfooted .
you' ve got to move your feet .
that' s one of the best things i' m going to be able to teach you .
so , here' s what you do .
you get yourself ...
bend your knees a little bit .
get in an athletic position .
look like you' re going to hit something .
move ' em how , boss ?
uh , just , you go hit the bag .
stop .
what' d i do wrong ?
ok , you did two things wrong .
one is you asked a question , and two is you asked another question .
now , what i want you to do ...
it' s not about hitting it hard .
it' s how good you hit it .
so , watch me .
and you can count with me if you want , just count ;
on a one count , i hit right through the bag .
can you show me that again ?
you just ...
just say " one " , please .
one .
ok , one .
one .
ok .
yeah , just say one .
that' s good .
that' s good .
then i move over to my right foot .
you' il see my weight is shifting to my right foot .
then i hit it with the back of my hand , sort of like i' m chipping ice with an ice pick .
then i come over , and i shift to my left foot , and i hit it with my right hand .
and ice pick manoeuvre again , and i come over on my right foot and hit it right , left .
don' t watch anything but my feet .
one , two , three ...
just do it like that .
just keep practising .
need to show ' em how to stand , keep their legs under their shoulders .
to make a fighter , you got to strip ' em down to bare wood .
rest when you' re dead .
come here .
you can' t just tell ' em to " forget everything you know " .
you got to make ' em forget it in their bones .
left uppercut , left , left .
make ' em so tired they only listen to you , only hear your voice , only do what you say and nothing else .
move your feet .
move your feet around .
let' s see you go .
show ' em how to keep their balance and take it away from the other guy .
not so low .
look at me .
right hook and just turn right over ...
how to generate momentum off your right toe ... ... and how to flex your knees when you fire a jab .
how to fight backing up , so that the other guy doesn' t want to come after you .
then you got to show ' em all over again over and over and over till they think they were born that way .
shift .
shift away .
shift away .
ok , that' s enough for today .
good work .
good girl .
think i' m ready for a fight , boss ?
hey .
hey , come here .
you' re not breathing .
hate to disagree with you .
every time you get under pressure , you' re holding your breath .
now , stop doing that .
ok .
but other than that , i' m doing pretty good , right ?
i mean , for a girl .
i don' t train girls .
think i might be ready for a fight , boss ?
well , we' il get a manager , and we' il find out , won' t we ?
i' d like to , but you' ve been keeping me to0 busy .
got any family , boss ?
what ?
you been spending all this time with me .
i didn' t know if you had any .
no .
well , i' ve got a daughter katy .
that' s family .
we' re not exactly close .
how much she weigh ?
what ?
trouble in my family comes by the pound .
yeah .
not very big .
used to be real athletic .
don' t know if she kept it up .
so ... what do you think ?
am i ready for a fight ?
hey , sally .
come here for a minute , will you ?
frankie , i need to see you in the back for a minute , ok ?
can i see you a minute ?
sally here is a real good manager .
has a couple golden glove boys .
looking for a girl , sally ?
i' m looking for a good one .
well , see , there you go .
nice working with you , girlie .
what' d you want ?
nothing .
it' s nothing .
i ain' t lying .
i been watching you work .
you' ve got a hell of a left .
thank you .
so , you want to give this a try , see if it' s a fit ?
yeah , sure .
good ... cos i think you' re ready for a fight .
all right .
break !
what am i doing wrong , sally ?
every time i get inside , she' s on me .
you' re doing great .
you' re wearing her down .
just keep punching .
i ain' t doing great .
i' m losing .
you' re wearing her down .
nice night , ain' t it ?
jesus christ .
that' s lonnie washington' s girl .
hell of a fighter .
11 and 0 .
your left .
keep your left up .
lonnie' s got a lot of good fighters .
he' s got joey adagio , lightweight champ .
yeah .
your left , damn it !
wouldn' t have been my choice for a first fight , but sally' s a good manager .
he must think she can take her .
jesus h , your left !
keep your left up !
you think she can hear you from back here ?
of course , if maggie loses , it wouldn' t mean anything to sally .
might even help him .
lonnie' s girl gets another win ,
lonnie might let sally' s lightweight fight joey adagio for the title .
sally' s trying to set a fight with adagio ?
hey , what do i know ?
i just come cos i enjoy the fights .
mother of god !
ok , break !
hey !
come here , come here .
hey , get over here !
you' re dropping your left hand .
quit dropping your left hand .
hey , frankie , you mind if i talk to my fighter ?
you' re doing a hell of a job of it .
is this how you advise your lightweight ?
dunn , what the hell are you doing ?
i' m talking .
what you doing ?
this your fighter ?
it' s my fighter !
it ain' t fitting real well , sally .
fine .
you take her .
she can' t fight worth a shit , anyway .
somebody tell me what' s going on .
i was late .
sally was just subbing for me .
you' re telling me this is your fighter ?
yeah , this is my fighter .
then you got ten seconds .
i keep holding my left up , then i throw a punch and it drops .
well , let it drop .
that' d be a lot easier .
she thinks she knows you , that' s all .
every time you drop it , she comes right over the top , so you just wait for her , see ?
that' s all she' s thinking about .
and when she cocks that big right hand , you hear me ?
and when she does , you step to the side and come over with this big " good night " hook .
got one ?
got it right here .
ok .
fight , or i' m calling it .
go give it to her .
the body knows what fighters don' t how to protect itself .
a neck can only twist so far .
twist it just a hair more , and the body says ,
hey , i' il take it from here , cos you obviously don' t know what you' re doing " .
neutral corner .
two , three , four ...
see the way she did that ?
yeah .
sugar ray would do that .
girl' s got sugar .
lie down , now .
rest , and we' il talk about this when you regain your senses " .
it' s called the knockout mechanism .
don' t get all carried away , now .
good girl .
thanks , boss .
you , uh ...
you forgot the rule .
now , what is the rule ?
keep my left up ?
it' s to protect yourself at all times .
now , what is the rule ?
protect myself at all times .
good , good .
you gave me away .
how' s that protecting me ?
it wasn' t .
it' s ok .
i' il work on my left , boss .
drink your water .
other than that , how' d i do ?
fine .
you did fine .
you gonna leave me again ?
never .
that place you work do they have homemade lemon meringue pie there ?
sure .
not the kind with the canned filling crap ?
oh , big can , yea size .
it says " homemade " on the label .
i want you to take the weekend off .
it' s only thursday .
you gonna argue with me ?
know better than to do that , boss .
good .
all fighters are pig headed some way or other .
some part of them always thinks they know better than you about something .
can you uh ... spare a few minutes for the immaculate conception ?
truth is , even if they' re wrong , even if that one thing is going to be the ruin of them , if you can beat that last bit out of ' em , then they ain' t fighters at all .
thought i said i' d see you monday .
you sure did , boss .
that was last night .
you said not to argue with you .
damn woman won' t do a thing i tell her .
you want my advice ?
what ?
where are your shoes ?
i' m airing out my feet .
you got big holes in your socks .
oh , they' re not that big .
didn' t i give you money for some new ones ?
these are my sleeping socks .
my feet like a little air at night .
how come you' re wearing ' em in the daytime , then ?
cos my daytime socks got to0 many holes in ' em .
well , if i give you some more money , you buy some new socks .
please .
well , i' d be tempted , but i couldn' t say for sure .
might find its way to the track .
oh !
didn' t take maggie long to hit her stride .
i got the breathing thing down .
no , you ain' t breathing because you' re knocking ' em out in the first round .
thought that was the point .
the point is to get good .
can' t get good if you keep knocking ' em out in the first round .
how am i going to get you fights ?
nobody wants to see their fighter embarrassed .
why am i still doing four rounders , boss ?
cos you haven' t got the lungs for six rounds , that' s why .
i do if i keep knocking ' em out in the first round .
frankie made her fight one more four rounder ... just to let her know who was boss .
three , four , five , six , seven ...
sorry , boss .
maggie left no doubt about it .
her first six rounder didn' t go quite as smooth .
down !
to the corner .
three , four ... five ... six , seven , eight ... nine , ten !
it' s over !
maggie didn' t knock her out till the end of the first round .
after that , no manager wanted to put his fighter in with maggie .
frankie had to go into his pocket to get her decent fights , sweetening the purse by paying managers on the side .
but that only worked for so long .
then frankie did something he hated doing .
he took a chance .
he moved her up in class .
that could' ve been a mistake .
break .
break .
step back .
time .
dang .
dang .
hey , give us two seconds , will ya ?
just two seconds .
your nose is broke .
dang !
fix it .
i can' t .
i can' t .
you can fix it .
i can' t .
i' ve gotta call it .
i' ve seen what you can do .
fix it .
i can snap it back into place , but i can' t stop the bleeding .
the ring doctor' s gonna call it .
please .
if you can stop the blood , i can beat her .
bite down on this .
ok .
inhale .
what ?
inhale .
what ?
breathe in .
ok , huh ?
yeah , it' s ok .
yeah .
all right .
you got 20 seconds before this turns into a geyser and it' s gonna spray all over the front row .
20 seconds that' s all you' ve got .
get goin ' .
go to your corner !
two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight , nine , ten !
mo cuishle " .
whatcha reading ?
what' s she saying ?
wants to know what you' re reading .
it' s yeats .
keep your head back .
why don' t you talk a little yeats to her ?
show her what a treat that is .
when the hell they gonna get to her ?
i' m ok , frankie .
what' d you learn tonight ?
always protect myself .
what' s the rule ?
always protect myself .
margaret fitzgerald ?
here .
i' il be right here .
how you doin ' ?
me ?
yeah , you .
i' m not the one who' s hurt .
broken nose don' t hurt that much .
why are you telling me that ?
no reason .
but some wounds are too deep or too close to the bone .
and no matter how hard you work at it , you just can' t stop the bleeding .
did you write your daughter ?
every week .
i' ve no idea why you come to church .
after her 12th straight knockout , frankie got a couple of real good offers .
the first was to fight billie " the blue bear " osterman for the wba welterweight title .
billie the blue bear !
billie was a former prostitute out of east berlin .
had a reputation for being the dirtiest fighter in the ranks .
didn' t matter to her something like that could kill a person .
and the crowds loved her .
he turned it down without even telling her .
the next was to fight the british champ , a jamaican girl billie just beat .
hello ?
not interested .
he turned that down , too .
that' s a lot of money , boss .
yeah .
you' re making money .
what' re you still working here for ?
it' s a title match , right ?
are you british ?
it' s a title you can' t take away .
she' s got nothing to lose , you got nothing to win .
might still be a good fight .
yeah .
i ju ...
i just brought you up to welterweight .
to0 good to fight these contenders , you' d rather fight some bullshit champ ?
didn' t notice i was fighting any contenders .
well , you can get yourself another manager any time you want .
in fact , if you' d learnt to protect your face a little better ,
i wouldn' t have to turn down this money .
my face out there so much , it' s a miracle i ain' t been knocked out yet , boss .
