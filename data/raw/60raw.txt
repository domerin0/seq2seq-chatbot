no wonder you' re our leader .
all i want is general yang in return for the lives of these villagers .
give me the general by noon tomorrow .
if your late by even one minute ...
we' il start killing them on a live broadcast for the world to see .
remember ...
i don' t like to make threats .
i only like to act .
therefore don' t do anything you' re not supposed to .
everyone , we have to get the village and the people back !
dad !
calm down .
we have to find a way out of this village .

withdraw your swat team to outside a 5 mile radius .
if my soldiers see them again , i will kill all the villagers .
now .
i want general yang delivered at 8am .
we will wait to make sure that no one follows us .
if you do anything stupid ...
i promise you the mass murdering of all the villagers online .
the nuclear missile weighs 1375 kilos , this is the head of the missile .

set its destination for bangkok .
tomorrow morning i am .
yes sir .
i am going to pick up the general at 8am .
within 20 minutes , the general and i should cross the border .
foh , use the key as your weapon .
you have 5 minutes to take our troops out of the village .
watch for me and the general .
once we' re clear , broadcast the image of the villagers .
tomorrow this place will be nothing but debris .
nothing will survive .
bangkok will be wiped off the face of thailand .
the world will know that no one can stop us !
drop your gun .
i said drop your gun !
now report to the leader .
don' t wait for general yang .
fire the missile at bangkok immediately .
pe deaw , what' s wrong ?
bro ...
it was only a bad dream .
no .
its really going to happen .
what do you want to do ?
do you want to die ?
or do you want to fight ?
you don' t believe me ?
haven' t you seen how many people they' ve killed ?
how many more millions of other thai people have to die ?
i' m telling you the truth .
think about them .
your fathers , your mothers , your brothers , your sisters , all your relatives ...
but if we fight , they might survive .
the thai flag represents our country .
think about your ancestors that built this country .
it' s 8am .
thailand is the unity of thai blood and body
the entire country belongs to the thai people
maintaining thus far for the thai
all thais intend to unite together
thais love peace but do not fear to fight
they will never let any one threaten their independence
they will sacrifice every drop of their blood to contribute to their nation
they will serve their country with pride and prestige , full of victory !
get ready to fire !
fire !
take care of general yang , then cross over the mountains .
lets fight !
charge !
bro !

you guys move ahead !
take general yang away from here !
protect him !
