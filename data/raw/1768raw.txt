who is it ?
answer me , samantha .
don' t you imagine it ?
is it father joseph ?
is that your lover ?
he listens to me .
he listens to me and understands me .
but i do as well !
no , richard .
you don' t listen to me anymore .
of course !
you never speak to me !
evidently we' ve got nothing to tell each other anymore .
this doesn' t prevent us from being a couple !
a couple ?
what is " a couple " for you ?
i' m your husband and you' re my wife !
i was your wife , but it' s over now .
what ?
can i help you ?
i' ve got an appointment with doctor ...
monnier .

good bye .
good evening .
good evening .

thanks .
my secretary is out .
you are ms ... ?
what' s your name ?
oh , sorry , i am ...
yes ?
hi jacques ...

no , let' s talk about it now .
just a moment , don' t hang up .
i have to talk 2 minutes to a colleague .
if you want to sit down in the meanwhile ...
please .
please .
no , no ...
i know , i know .
i tell you that i know .
counterfeited balance .
to be honest there' s nothing i can do .
no , absolutely nothing .
you know what ?
let me address him to our friend at the prosecutor' s office .
he' s specialized in those kinds of problems .
yes ...
let' s do it that way .
sorry .
you forgot your purse .
being your first time , you have to fill in a form with some information .
information ?
please , sit down .
your age , profession , civil state ...
who addressed you to me ?
nobody .
i searched the phone book ,
i wanted someone near and so i called .
the first in the list couldn' t before two months .
i had urgency and ...
urgency ?
there' s a problem ... a personal problem .
may i ?
of course .
my husband doesn' t bear it .
i had succeeded in quitting , but ...
a personal problem , you said ?
yes .
with my husband .
we' ve been married for four years ...
sorry .
thanks .
we don' t get along well anymore , my husband and i.
he' s changed much since he stopped working ..
why , what happened to him ?
health problems .
but do you work ?
yes , i' ve always worked .
my husband didn' t want me to , but ...
i' m not the housewife kind .
i' m a shop assistant in a boutique .
purses , suitcases ...
will you excuse me .
yes ?
that' s why i' m here , madam ...
see you tomorrow at five o' clock .
see you , madam .
pardon me , please .
apart from my husband i haven' t got anyone to speak to .
not even your colleagues ?
no , we only speak about the job .
anyone in your family ?
no one .
i' m afraid i' il become crazy .
have you ever told that to your husband ?
i tried , but ...
he treats me like a child .
we haven' t got any children .
i wanted a few , but ...
it' s too late .
he doesn' t touch me anymore .
we haven' t got sex anymore .
we haven' t had sex for more than six months .
no more sex all of a sudden , while we used to be very close before .
and i miss it , to take pleasure from him .
but not only that .
also his kisses , his caresses ...
his body against mine ...
understand ?
i' m not used to speak of myself this way .
i' d rather stop .
so ?
will you accept ?
accept what ?
my case .
how many sessions will it take ?
that' s how they are called , isn' t it ?
i understand , you still don' t know .
is next week possible ?
on thursday at the same time ?
doctor ?
did you tell her you' re a psychiatrist ?
no , i haven' t told her anything .
it' s her who believes that .
she has taken me for doctor monnier .
who ?
doctor monnier , the psychiatrist who has a study on my same floor .
she had an appointment with him .
and haven' t you told her she had knocked on the wrong door ?
i realized that when it was too late .
my clients often speak to me about their personal problems .
i thought that she wanted to consult me about a divorce .
can you pass me those books , please ?
and what' s she like ?
what do you mean ?
is she pretty ?
i would not know .
while she was speaking she started to cry , and that ... made you upset .
what have you two spoken about ?
her problems with her husband .
she has found an expert !
good morning .
good morning .
i am looking for a book .
could you give me more details ?
room " is in the title , i think .
that' s really useful .
do you still want to meet him ?
who ?
luc .
he' s coming to get me .
the bodybuilder ?
he isn' t a bodybuilder , he manages a club .
a club for swinging couples ?
a fitness club .
when you left me ...
wait a minute , it' s you who left me , and the last time you did , was the seventh .
if she' s sick she needs a real therapist .
you can' t go on lying to her that way .
call her and tell her the truth .
i don' t even know her name .
here is luc .
hi flea .
so ...
luc , this is william .
the famous william !
they say you' re the best in your field , mate .
i' m not your mate .
he' s so witty ! ... business booming , is it ?
i don' t understand what you mean .
let' s go , flea .
you' ve got a body sculpture lesson .
bye .
let' s hug each other next time , okay ?
it' s better .
william , when she comes you' il tell her " i am not a psychoanalyst ,
i' m a tax consultant " .
will you tell her ?
of course .
who do you think i am ?
according to you , mr. faber , can we contest the partition ? ... because the tax inspector told me that ...
i told you that the administration made a mistake with the quotients assigning two parts to you .
your daughter , who is eighteen but still dependent on you , gives you the right to an additional half .
have you understood ?
not really , no .
if you could repeat ...
everything will be alright .
i' il take care of your file .
thanks , mr. faber .
good day , madam .
good day sir .
your father ?
how does it feel to be retired ?
when i met him i still had my confectionery , the " ringo starr " .
send him my regards , please .
i will , thank you .
thanks a lot and see you .
see you , mr. michel .
i' m done with the typing .
do you still need me ?
no , you can go , mrs. mulon .
enjoy your life !
do you want me to cook something for you ?
no , i' il do it myself .
i know .
poor thing ...
good evening , doctor .
come in ...
there' s something i didn' t dare tell you the other time .
it' s not easy .
i' m supposed to say everything , right ?
as a matter of fact , i wanted to tell you ...
there' s too much light , could you ... ?
my husband doesn' t touch me anymore .
better than being beaten .
but he would like ...
i' m sorry .
he wants me to have sex with another man .
oh , another man .
someone you know ?
no , it doesn' t matter who .
he' s getting obsessed by this .
you have the right to fuck with anyone " .
it' s him who uses the word " fuck " .
the women who do such things to survive have no choice but i ...
he' s the one who needs professional help ...
how can you bear it ?
we' d better break up .
we can' t go on like that .
why ?
that' s how it is .
i' ve got to go now .
i' il give you what i owe you .
no , listen ...
no , i haven' t got enough money , sorry .
i' il pay you next time .
when will it be ?
monday , same time ?
listen to me ...
i' m not a doctor .
aren' t you ?
i thought that ...
but have you understood what i want to say ?
yes , i have .
not all the psychoanalysts are graduate , but a degree or a diploma , is the same to me .
see you on monday , doctor .
mrs. mulon ,
any phone calls ?
from whom ?
a young lady .
what' s her name ?
it doesn' t matter .
no one has called .
good morning madam .
good morning .
sorry for the trouble .
could i speak with doctor monnier ?
have you got an appointment ?
no , i' m his neighbour , mr. faber .
the tax consultant .
oh , of course .
what would you like to tell him ?
a friend of mine had to meet the doctor at the beginning of the month .
it is possible .
and ?
well , we had lost contact , then we met again in the lift , but she was in a hurry .
i wanted to call her but i haven' t got her number anymore .
what day exactly ?
tuesday 2nd at six o' clock p . m .
yes , there was a patient .
it was her first session .
that' s her .
but she didn' t come
without notice .
it' s her .
what' s your friend' s name ?
i don' t know , because i know her first name , but i don' t absolutely know her family name .
rather twisted , your story .
but i need to contact her .
be kind .
i' il go and ask the doctor if he can receive you .
sofas as deep as graves " .
do you know this verse by baudelaire ?
face to face will do , for a first session .
but i don' t believe that ...
i' m listening .
i don' t feel wanted anymore " ...
i think my husband is cheating on me " ...
he got the wrong woman and i got the wrong door " ...
but i' m not surprised by the mistake of this young lady .
to work on ourselves is not easy .
no , the strangest thing is your behaviour .
you didn' t tell her she made a mistake .
the first time okay , but the second ...
however the thing is over .
she was supposed to come two days ago , but she hasn' t and i haven' t heard from her .
so everything is alright ?
no , because i' d like to see her again .
you are free .
if she had opened your heart to you at a party would you have asked for my permission ?
wait a moment , she has mistaken me for you ..
she has .
i don' t like it when someone steals my clients .
but i' ve got to tell her the truth .
i need her number .
i don' t know anything about her at all .
you already know too much .
i' d like to know where she lives , at least .
everyone would like to know many things , my dear gentleman , but it' s not always possible .
no .
i am desolate , but
i cannot give out any information regarding patients above all when they' re not even my own .
that' il be 120 .
euros .
it' s part of the therapy .
of the therapy ...
i repeat , mr. chapel , that he' il receive you .
good bye .
good bye , madam .
but had said three o' clock , it has to be three o' clock !
... but please understand ...
calm down mr. chapel ...
but he said at three o' clock !
i' il go get you some water .
everything will be alright , you' il see .
i bring you the water .
calm down .
alright .
i' m fine , i apologize .
good morning .
good morning .
i wanted to say that i' m ... ...
meteo france " .
today , the weather in paris will be windy and rainy for the rest of the night .
therefore , the temperature will be rather fresh ...
excuse me , but a person insists to see you .
she hasn' t got an appointment , but ...
i' il be right there .
shall we stay here ?
no , come in .
want to know why i didn' t come last time ?
i have to tell you that i' m not doctor monnier .
i know .
i' ve known it for a while .
i wanted to delay our appointment , and when i called the real doctor monnier picked up .
his voice was different from yours .
it was a shock .
i thought , if he' s not him , then ... ... then who is he ?
i should have never returned here .
i thought it' s disgusting .
that guy knows all about me and i know nothing about him .
so , mr. faber , you' re a tax consultant .
what' s your job about ?
i help my clients to deal ... with their own taxes .
without cheating ?
yes .
well , yes and no ...
you cheated on me .
the appearances are against me .
please to forgive me .
will you ?
no .
i could have killed you .
i really could have .
listen , there' s been a misunderstanding .
i am sorry about that .
and i , when i realized i had spoken about my problems to a perfect stranger , i felt dirty , as if you had raped me .
raped ...
yes , raped .
no one can help me ...
i don' t agree ...
nobody can .
i' m coming .
am i disturbing you ?
are you with the family ?
the family ?
no , no ...
i have wandered about the district .
i hate this hour , when it gets dark .
the shops close , the people return home ...
i should as well , but i was sorry i had left like that .
never mind .
i came again because i haven' t got your number .
neither have i , mrs. de lambre ...
did you investigate on me ?
well , you disappeared ...
no , i' ve only asked my neighbour , doctor monnier , if he could give me your number .
and ?
don' t you imagine ?
i didn' t want him to call me at home , because of my husband . ... and you gave him the number of the weather forecasts .
the first one which came to my mind .
we use it at the boutique .
when they say it will rain , we put the umbrellas in the windows .
on tuesday at half past six , mr. faber ?
yes , of course .
but how can i call you ?
anna , if you want .
no , i meant by phone ...
don' t you ever call me .
see you on tuesday .
so ?
what do you think ?
it has a good bouquet .
i didn' t mean the bordeaux but luc .
tell me honestly .
well , he is ... ... he' s very physical , isn' t he ?
indeed .
not your kind at all .
you' il have to get rid of my books ...
there is no hurry ...
mister muscle doesn' t care that you' re spending the evening with me ?
i told him i had a meeting at the faculty .
have you seen her again ?
who ?
the weeping girl .
yes .
have you told her you aren' t a psychiatrist ?
of course .
i had to .
whose makeup is this ?
yours .
did you keep it ?
yes , just in case ...
don' t you want to stay ?
no , william .
tonight was just ... just nothing .
hello ?
hello !
hello , who is it !
who was it ?
no one , i hung up .
were you waiting for a phone call ?
no .
which floor ?
the sixth .
me too .
thank you , but i' d rather use the stairs .
up to six floors ?
i prefer so .
i' m early .
the first time i saw this sofa i thought it wasn' t bad at all ...
sometimes i take a nap ...
i was late today because the streets were full of people , and i don' t like the crowd .
i had to walk through secondary streets .
wouldn' t it be simpler for you to come by car ?
my husband forbids me to drive .
he forbids you to drive , he forbids you to smoke ...
what else ?
who knows what he does alone in the house all day .
and how do you spend your days ?
i try to survive .
i get up , i go to work ... ... and that' s it .
wouldn' t you like to do something else , a more interesting job , perhaps ?
i have already done all .
shop assistant , waitress , smoker ...
drinker in times of depression .
there' s something that ... but it' s rather a passion than a job .
when i was a child i studied classical dance for seven years .
it was fantastic , hard but fantastic .
my old teacher , above all .
he was the first one to show some interest for me
really .
who knows if i could still ...
why don' t you try ?
please , have a try .
come on ...
excuse me , but ... an urgent fax has arrived .
i' il be back later .
wouldn' t you like to dance again ?
a star of the ballet ?
i' m too old for that .
age doesn' t matter , if you believe in yourself .
well ...
i used to , when i was young ...
when you were young ...
well , yes .
i have done everything too soon and too badly .
i left school at 14 .
i left home at 16 .
home " so to speak .
we lived in a camper .
my mother thought it was more practical , because we travelled all the time .
we were always travelling .
to the south , in the sun , without love or hate , i simply didn' t exist .
sometimes , in the evening , she brought in a man .
she made me go out and forgot about me .
my mother has never brought anybody in .
i have to go now .
my train leaves in half an hour .
do you live far ?
in switzerland .
in a quiet corner of the suburbs .
small gardens , small houses ...
i imagine that switzerland is like that .
see you next time ?
see you , madam .
see you .
see you .
anything wrong , mrs. mulon ?
nothing , apart from the ashtrays i have to empty .
is she a new client ?
yes , why ?
i haven' t got any file on her .
i' m taking care of her file .
personally .
the majority of my patients come here for complaining .
nobody wants to listen to others anymore .
not even hairdressers or waiters have got the patience anymore .
this young woman has found the ideal listener in you .
but it' s not a good thing ...
since she hasn' t got any serious pathologies ...
i can' t forbid you to see her .
your job , after all , is not very different from mine .
we both deal with the same types of neurosis : what is declared and what is kept hidden .
well , i can listen to her , but as for solving problems ...
the lady' s or yours ?
mr. faber is going to be busy for a while .
you hadn' t got an appointment , miss ...
mrs.
and after that , he has another appointment .
i' il wait .
can i deduce the customs duty ?
otherwise they' il tax me twice , and that' s not fair .
last time it was even an old stock .
i can' t accept your case , too many details are missing .
but you have got everything ...
yes , but it' s a complex case .
yes , but ...
no , i' m telling you your case is complex , very , very complex .
do you understand ?
we' il speak about it some other time .
i' m sorry .
after you .
see you .
talk to you soon , dear sir .
you forgot it here .
thanks .
it got stuck .
may i ?
thanks .
isn' t it too boring ?
the files , all those papers ...
boring ?
no , not at all .
you know , taxes can tell a whole life , they tell a lot of things , births , marriages , divorces , success , failures and deaths .
my delays worry my husband when i come here .
but what worries him ?
he thinks that i meet someone .
someone ?
a psychologist ?
no .
a man , a lover , that' s it .
but isn' t that what he wanted ?
only if i tell him about it .
i told him i had to stay at the shop till late .
i don' t know why i lied to him .
but tell him the truth ...
what ?
that i go to a psychiatrist' s ?
that would be another lie .
and , which is worse , he wouldn' t understand what i do in here .
he would imagine other things .
but you aren' t forced to tell him everything .
secrets are allowed in a couple .
in a couple , yes .
why do you always wear a tie ?
are you forced to ?
no , i' m not forced at all ...
it reassures you .
yes , mrs. mulon ?
oh , never mind .
could i have something to drink ?
certainly .
mrs. mulon , would you be so kind
as to bring us two cups of coffee , please ?
tea .
wait a second ...
a tea and a coffee , please .
what does he think ?
this isn' t a cafe ...
my husband , i' ve seen him dead .
in a dream ?
no , for real .
i am very sorry .
when did it happen ?
six months ago .
he was about to die for my fault .
when i was small i couldn' t read , count , walk ...
it still happens to me sometimes .
i can' t tell left from right ,
i confuse the words ...
you get the wrong doors ...
that too .
that evening i was getting the car out of the garage , and the electric gate , you know ?
no , i don' t ...
a wrong manoeuvre .
i drove backwards too fast and i didn' t notice that my husband was there , hiding in the dark .
what was he doing in the dark ?
it' s a game between us .
i heard him shout .
too late .
i smashed his left leg against the wall .
i made him an invalid .
wheelchair ?
no , only a cane .
he isn' t happy to use it , but sometimes he falls down and i have to help him get up .
thanks .
thanks , mrs. mulon .
thanks .
he hasn' t touched me since then , since the accident .
according to him , another man would be a way to bring back his desire .
it' s a dangerous game .
what if you fell in love ?
with whom ?
with the other man .
i should meet him , before .
who' s that sad woman ?
i don' t know ...
nobody .
it makes me shiver .
i used to think that she was my father' s secret lover , but he' s too serious for that .
even if for some time he had a crush on madame mulon .
the secretary ?
yes , she was his own , at first .
she had some kind of vagueness .
vagueness ?
i don' t know what it means .
it means ... she was attractive .
see you .
good bye .
see you .
i can finally shake a hand , yours , at least .
it' s a beginning .
see you on thursday .
good morning , mrs. mulon .
jeanne , good morning !
i thought she wasn' t coming to see you anymore .
even now that she knows you aren' t a psychiatrist ...
oh , i understand .
no , you don' t ...
she only speaks to me about her husband , a vicious man who makes her suffer .
she only has to leave him .
it' s not so simple , he dominates her and she is afraid of him .
luckily , she met you .
you will save her ...
hm hmmm .
i can' t believe that !
what ?
you said " hmmm " like a psychiatrist .
and how do you know that psychiatrists say " hmmm " ?
because i' ve been in analysis for six months .
you too ?
but why ?
i' m elaborating my mourning .
mourning ?
has anyone died ?
i' m elaborating the mourning of our story .
so ?
how about the sofa ?
the small one , i have come for it ...
i' m glad you' re taking it away , it' s useless .
it' il suit your place much better .
it is nice , isn' t it ?
delicious .
hold on , take away this too .
you have always said that you liked it so much ...
are you sure that you won' t miss it ?
no .
leave it to me , mrs. mulon ...
thanks .
my pleasure .
hi willy .
this is a men' s thing .
thanks a lot .
my goodness , it' s huge !
the biggest on the market .
you' re so lucky ...
if you like it , i can get you one .
the importer works out in my club .
very kind of you , but i haven' t got the license .
it' s a joke , isn' t it ?
well , come on .
we have to hurry , the traffic is terrible at this hour .
how strange , i knew you would say that .
you aren' t zen at all .
no , i am not zen .
i have swallowed an umbrella , and it was open .
you should chill out , mate .
what are you doing here ?
where is your wicked secretary ?
it' s her day off .
why do you say she' s wicked ?
she looks like it .
where were you ?
at a client' s , for a tax inspection .
it went on for hours .
you could have called me .
how could i ?
and then we hadn' t got an appointment .
we did , it was for wednesday .
no , it was for thursday .
no , it was for wednesday .
i haven' t dreamt of it .
oops it was for thursday .
sometimes i get confused , you know .
yes , i do .
i have to pee .
i can' t resist .
it' s at the end of the corridor on the left .
should i take you there ?
thanks , i don' t need any witnesses .
on the left ...
i' ve understood .
this house is so tidy ...
everything is in place , perfectly ...
who cleans up ?
i do it myself .
is it a mania ?
no , i just like it .
it was my dad' s lighter ,
it' s all that he left , besides a photo .
and i don' t even know if he' s my father .
you' re dying to know more , aren' t you ?
he died in a car accident shortly after my birth .
my mother was driving .
she killed my father and i have almost killed my husband .
now you' ve got the whole picture .
how strange ...
what ?
the accident which repeats itself , from mother to daughter .
did you get rid of the sad woman ?
yes , poor thing .
she had been there for thirty years ...
have you lived here for thirty years ?
longer than that .
i was born here , i have never moved .
this office was my father' s .
when he retired he left it to me .
and you put your toys in here ...
as you can see .
this is funny .
what' s it' s name ?
is it a secret ?
my taw taw .
what does it mean ?
my toy " ?
i think so .
careful , please .
it' s fragile .
and what did your father do ?
same as me .
oh .
also this repeats itself , from father to son .
i would never imagine i' d do his same job .
when i was a teen i wanted to be an explorer to conquer a lot of women and the world ... and then the world reduced itself to this apartment .
but don' t you ever travel ?
yes , for my job .
last year i went to belgium .
and how about the women ?
are you single ?
we cannot speak about you ?
there' s a closed door at the bottom .
it' s my parents ' room .
no , i was speaking of you , not of your apartment .
do you live here ?
no , i' m going to see someone .
me too , my psychiatrist .
doctor monnier ?
are you going to see him as well ?
no , another person .
another psychiatrist ?
more or less ...
and is he good ?
not bad .
how is yours ?
like a dentist .
but he hurts me even more .
i cannot use lifts .
why ?
i just can' t .
not even a floor , just to try ?
no .
doctor monnier says i' m not ready .
i wanted ...
i ...
oh ...
no no ...
no , sorry ...
no no , i beg you .
please tell me .
my husband doesn' t touch me anymore because ... because he hasn' t got erections anymore .
i would not care , really we could do other things . but he feels like he' s dead .
well no , not exactly .
he still has obsessions .
for example he likes ...
fantasies
yes , fantasies .
for example , he likes to watch me wash myself or go to bath .
really ...
as long as it helps him ...
don' t you understand ?
no , i can' t understand .
i think he should have himself cured .
what you said is horrible .
and isn' t your husband horrible too ?
why don' t you get rid of him ?
i already have .
no , i meant , why don' t you take back your freedom ?
freedom is not for me to leave him , it' s to find him again .
i apologize , i am sorry .
i' m sorry .
it' s nothing .
mr. faber ...
were you coming to see me ?
no no , i was passing by .
passing by ?
yes .
i' m going to lunch .
have you had lunch ?
no .
patients are the ones who make the investigation and gather the clues .
psychoanalysts don' t know anything .
they only know what the patients know .
are you following me ?
not really .
no , because the more i see her
and the less i understand what' s happening .
here' s the dessert .
chinese fruit' s salad .
thanks .
and the bill .
thanks .
listen .
the knots of your tie are impeccable , your business is going very well , but let your unwanted and temporary contact with psychoanalysis teach you this , at least : you haven' t got everything under control , there is something that escapes you .
we aren' t in my study and therefore this isn' t a consultation , but nothing prevents you from paying for my lunch .
something' s just passed through my mind .
who tells you that she' s really married ?
why would she lie to me ?
didn' t you make her believe you' re a psychoanalyst ?
what if she' s a mythomaniac ?
the fake neurotic and the fake psychiatrist .
it could be .
even better , she didn' t get the wrong door and rang your bell willingly .
samantha listen to me !
i beg you , be reasonable !
i can' t be reasonable !
i am in love with you !
this is a test , and you have to pass it !
i cannot love women !
because you' re a priest ?
excuse me .
which floor ?
and you ?
the sixth .
me too .
good morning .
you don' t want to listen to me anymore ?
if i didn' t want to , i would address you to doctor monnier .
what does he look like ?
he has a typical aspect , no one would mistake him for a tax consultant .
and your husband ?
my husband ?
what does he look like ?
have you got a husband or not ?
have you got a cigarette ?
no .
what' s his name ?
marc .
are you happy now ?
he made a scene .
a scene ?
why ?
he' s jealous ?
he knows that i go to a doctor .
why , he followed you ?
with that leg ?
how could he ?
no .
he must have peeped in my notebook .
he says we have to tell each other everything , and i so told him everything .
what ?
that i' ve got a lover .
that i go to bed with him after work .
my husband thinks that you' re the one .
me ?
yes .
well , the psychiatrist .
they can have an affair with their patients , can' t they ?
but what went through your mind to tell him that ?
he wanted me to meet someone and i have .
i can' t understand the way it works between you two .
before i met him , i was the cripple .
he lit everything up with his gaiety .
his gaiety , yes .
it is a word out of fashion , i know .
he was always cheerful , that' s why i loved him .
you don' t love him anymore ?
i feel some affection for him .
if you do , why do you come here ?
what are you expecting from me ?
i' ve had enough of your interrogatory tone .
my client ...
so far my client hasn' t received the transaction for the inheritance .
well , am i sorry but at this point ... will you excuse me for a second ?
don' t hang up .
come in , please .
i' m sorry .
yes , it' s annoying , very annoying .
look , i' il give you the 12th as a limit , otherwise ...
no , not one day more .
alright .
thanks for understanding .
see you , lawyer .
excuse me , you are mr ...
exactly .
i' m listening .
it' s complicated .
i' m used to that .
what' s the problem ?
you .
you know my wife anna .
i am marc , she must have spoken of me .
this is where it happens , then ...
at first i thought it was doctor monnier who fucked my wife .
i sent someone who could confirm that .
actually she didn' t go to a physician , she lied to me , which means she has got something to hide .
listen ...
i don' t think she comes here for the taxes , but it is alright , she is free .
what do you want from me ?
i wanted to see your face .
is your leg any better ?
she tells you everything !
not all , but she told me about the accident .
and you believed her ?
i understand you .
sometimes it' s better not to know the truth .
you !
make her happy !
mr. faber ?
your lift is out of standards .
if the box falls down , there isn' t any safety system .
let' s hope it never happens when you' re inside it .
that gentleman is so nice !
very .
having understood that father joseph is homosexual ,
samantha gets depressed . and tries to put and end to her days , but richard intervenes just in time to save her .
he is ready to forgive her .
can love between them spring up again ?
where are we ?
almost on the second floor .
how do you feel ?
i feel bad !
i feel like shouting !
then shout !
don' t be ashamed .
careful , i' m going to shout !
come on !
it' s a recurrent dream .
that' s why i speak of it , because when it happens i ...
how do you feel ?
you found me ridiculous , didn' t you ?
not at all .
i know what that means .
it is a great day for me , an immense victory .
also for me , believe me , but you' il see , next time you' il do it alone .
you won' t need to go to dr. monnier anymore .
and why do you go to a psychiatrist ?
it is him who needs me , i am his only patient .
bye .
coming here , i thought i was on holiday .
when it' s sunny i remember the summers i used to spend in the south .
people feel free , they do everything with calm , they go to the beach by scooter ...
do you understand ?
more or less .
is everything alright ?
yes , everything' s alright .
for you too , it seems ?
yes , i feel better .
did you notice ?
for a few days , i don' t know why , i' ve felt ... happier .
even my husband noticed i' ve changed , but of course he thinks it' s because of the sex .
he began again .
he' s no longer satisfied by the fact that i' ve got someone , therefore i told him what the two of us do .
the two of us ?
me and my lover .
and what have you told him ?
sex on the psychiatrist' s sofa .
he likes the fact that it' s a psychiatrist , a tax consultant would be very less stimulating .
no offence meant .
can i tell you everything ?
i think so .
telling him ... what i do with my lover , i ...
yesterday , while having a bath , i caressed myself .
it wasn' t the first time , but yesterday i reached the top .
the top of what ?
to have an orgasm " sounds medical , so i say " to reach the top " .
how do you say that ?
why are you looking at me like that ?
do you think i' m sick ?
because you had a bath ?
i don' t think i can go on .
it' s normal , you weren' t prepared for this .
women who speak of their orgasms terrify men .
they wake up ancient fears from early childhood , but you cannot stop .
it will end when it has to end .
this half open door on the feminine mystery can hardly be closed again .
... no , because mr. faber i have to tell you that your father was totally ...
mr. fernand , he was an incredible person , he was perfect .
i understood all ...
how much does she pay you ?
nothing ...
are you crazy ?
she has to pay , it' s the rule .
how far did you get ?
she speaks and you listen ?
that' s all ?
of course !
does that surprise you ?
not from you .
you have never been able to take the initiative .
curious , this block .
she must be wondering what you' re waiting for ...
she doesn' t come to me for that .
you think ?
a woman who tells a tax consultant about her orgasms ?
do you get excited , at least ?
you don' t understand anything !
have you made a vow of chastity ?
wait !
you came to me to ask for advice , you should know what you want !
i don' t know anything anymore !
it' s simple , either you let her go or you fuck her !
i what ?
you haven' t answered me !
but i can' t !
i cannot court her .
or you don' t want to .
jeanne , you' re jealous .
so what ?
when i first met you you had dreams and ambitions , you wanted to write a novel , and you ended up cataloguing old books in a library .
the dust has made you acid .
good evening .
what are you doing here ?
your fascinating secretary said i could wait for you .
i walked around the house .
not bad at all !
there was a naked girl at the window .
you must never get bored here ...
but what ...
are you crazy ?
you' re hurting me !
and you hurt me .
get out of here !
get out at once !
i have no intention to speak with you !
i have thought about it a lot .
we can' t go on like this , the three of us .
what are you talking about ?
of your relationship .
there' s no relationship !
i' m in love with her .
i had foreseen that .
i understand you .
and have you told her ?
i didn' t imagine she would like a man of your kind , but she found someone , it' s better than nothing .
but i don' t want you two to hide .
you have to do it in my house .
you' re joking , aren' t you ?
do you think ?
come and fuck my wife at my house .
it excites me .
i' m not dead yet ...
before meeting her , i was a poor jerk .
i didn' t know that such a woman could exist .
the woman of my life .
it has to mean something ...
till death us do part .
you are sick .
love is a disease , yes .
incurable .
how' s your husband ?
you really care about that ?
yes .
he' s okay , he' s calmer .
he isn' t asking questions anymore .
the beast in the jungle " .
is it set in africa , and deals with fierce beasts ?
no , it is set in england and deals with grey people and melancholy ...
i can lend it to you , if you want .
thanks .
is that dress new ?
do you like it ?
yes , it fits you very well .
no ...
no , please , turn it off .
thanks .
excuse me , but there' s an urgent phone call .
the notary of the succession marchand , insists for speaking to you .
tell him i' il call him back .
i am busy , as you can see .
well , i better go .
no , no , why ?
your job is more important than me .
i' il call you .
bye .
do you want me to turn it on ?
no , no , it is alright .
hello ?
what do you want ?
why are you calling me at this hour ?
which window ?
see you .
that lady wants you to call her back at this number .
how long ago did she call ?
ten minutes .
couldn' t you pass her through to me ?
you were on a meeting .
hello ?
you were kind to call me back .
where are you now ?
at work ?
i have to speak to you .
immediately ?
yes , immediately .
come here , i' il be waiting .
see you .
the weather forecasts didn' t foresee the rain ?
so many unpredictable things are happening me ...
would you like to drink something ?
a coffee ?
yes please ...
no , i' d rather have ...
i don' t know , something strong .
i can' t find my father anymore ... my father' s lighter .
maybe i forgot it here ?
i' il look for it .
the other time , going out of here , it was raining .
do you remember ?
and who was on the corner of the road ?
my husband .
he was elegant , he wore a new shirt .
i asked him if he had an appointment , and he answered me that ... yes , with me .
he smiled .
he had booked a room in a hotel nearby , in the district .
i sat on the bed , i didn' t know what to do .
he put his hand right here , on my neck ...
a violent gesture , at first it frightened me . but then he started caressing me , and at the same time he stripped me .
he caressed my neck , my breasts , my thighs ...
he told me tender words .
he seemed a different man .
he pushed me down on the bed and left the light on .
he took my hand for me to caress him and we never left each other all night .
we found each other again .
i won' t tell you the details .
on the contrary , don' t spare me any detail ...
his mouth ... his tongue ... his fingers ... his fantasies .
sado , maso , scat ...
penetration ?
vaginal ?
anal ?
but what' s wrong with you ?
you can tell me everything but i cannot listen to everything .
i have seen you tonight , with your husband .
the room was in front of my study .
you didn' t notice , i guess .
no .
your husband came to see me , right here .
i don' t believe you .
he came here twice .
didn' t you know it ?
why did he come here ?
to speak to me of you .
you speak to me of him , he speaks to me of you .
and why didn' t you tell me ?
he wanted me to go and fuck his wife in his house , that' s what he said .
in the end he found more exciting to fuck her in front of my house .
last night , at the hotel , didn' t he make a phone call ?
i don' t know .
he called me , so i could enjoy the show .
yes ?
a client has been here for half an hour .
should i tell him to wait ?
no , tell him i' m coming .
we are over .
you look awful ...
don' t let anything poison your blood .
they say that life as a couple should be a source of happiness , but i' ve lived much better since i' ve been divorced .
i can watch crappy tv programmes for hours , eating chips .
good morning .
i wanted to give you back your book .
it doesn' t suit me .
the story is touching , but it ends badly .
have you found my lighter ?
no .
this is for you .
you' re very kind , thanks .
come in , please .
only for two minutes , then .
come in .
it' s our new travelling collection .
travelling ?
you can use it for shopping , if you want .
we didn' t see each other for ...
two weeks and two days .
i shouldn' t have told you those things , last time .
i didn' t want to shock you , but ...
i was so happy to have found my husband again .
at least i believed .
i understood some things , things that hurt me .
we talked , i spoke my heart out to him and i feel better .
i want to leave him .
you want to leave him ?
what if he doesn' t agree ?
so much the worse for him .
i' m taking back my freedom .
it was your advice , wasn' t it ?
what about us ?
our conversations ...
there' s nothing left to tell each other .
well ...
anna !
i am happy for you to feel better .
try to be happy .
with anyone , but happy .
good bye .
hi .
hi .
am i too early ?
no , i' ve just stopped working .
not on sunday !
it' s good for killing time .
it feels so good .
with luc i only ate vegetables and rice .
why , did you eat at all ?
jeanne ...
we broke up .
has he left you ?
no , i have .
he is a nonentity ... such a nonentity !
even in his arms i felt lonely .
there are other men ...
actually there aren' t so many others .
i' m sorry .
forget about it , please .
good morning , this is the study faber .
leave a message .
see you .
william ?
it' s me , anna .
are you in the house ?
no ?
if you' re there don' t pick up .
i' m imagining you at your desk , with the tie .
no !
not on sunday , at least !
it' s over , i have decided to start a new life , a lighter life .
i' m not a frightened girl anymore .
i have grown up , i think , thanks to you .
i had never felt so good with anybody else .
we could freely tell each other everything , without cheating , without lying .
i didn' t believe it was possible .
i' m leaving , away from here , away from everything , to try and start over .
i owe this to you as well .
i' m glad i knocked on the wrong door .
i wanted to say thanks .
thanks for everything .
well , here' s my train .
i have to go .
good bye .
mr. faber , are you leaving us ?
well , it' s now or never , doctor .
how about that woman ?
do you still see her ?
no , she left paris ,
and she also left her husband .
this proves you' ve succeeded .
succeeded ?
it is the purpose of the therapy , to cut it off , to move .
good bye , doctor .
mr. faber , we found this under the sofa .
thanks .
5 , 6 , 7 , 8 ... 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 ...
no , stop , stop , stop .
pascal , stop .
that' s not good .
this isn' t " swan lake " , you seem a bunch of elephants ...
once again .
with more grace , children , okay ?
straighten your backs , this way .
good ...
let' s start again .
in line !
5 , 6 , 7 , 8 ...
anna ?
someone left you this message .
i couldn' t understand well .
thanks .
very well ...
vivienne , your head !
we can meet there tomorrow at eleven o' clock , if it' s okay .
don' t forget to bring the report of your incomes , we' il need it .
it' s alright , agreed .
see you tomorrow .
bye .
good morning .
you came ...
the message said that someone had something for me .
how did you find me ?
i called your number .
which number ?
the weather forecasts ' .
they said it would be rainy in the north and sunny in the south .
i hesitated , then ...
no .
i was sure you' d go south .
deep south , in the sun . as when you were small , with the beach and the scooters ...
do you remember all ?
the question is " why ? " .
why have i looked for you everywhere ?
i missed our appointments .
so did i.
so ?
where were we ?
