can' t control any one of my limbs !
i really wish to hold her day and night ,
instead of watching tv alone .
but she' il never know
or even notice this guy me !
doting on her forever
nervously biting my fingers ,
my dignity is gone
but she won' t know my thoughts !
she makes me losing weight
and terribly upset .
i really want to put up an advert .
and describe in details my loving feelings .
crazily in love
chewing up tissue paper .
i should find a few doctors ,
to cure my infatuation .
checking here and checking there .
but still can' t cure my infatuation !
